7 2018-08-08 23:57:21 Who cares! Canada produces the same amount of oil! And plus why would Canada align itself with a country that has no human rights and treats women like a second-class citizen. And no free speech against there policies and government.

40 2018-08-08 23:55:42 Why don't we just use the trillion dollars in subsidies to oil and gas sector and simply build the already proven tidal generators.
41 2018-08-08 23:55:24 If that means the opportunity to trade our oil with other countries outside the U.S...I'm in. Trump has shown us that we must diversify in trading partners and always have a backup plan we cannot rely solely on the USA or any one country for that matter.

43 2018-08-08 23:55:09 Post college life comes out of nowhere. One day you’re out till 3 in the morning drinking with your buddies, then the next thing you know you’re getting your oil changed, spending 2 hours in a Barnes and Noble purchasing 70 dollars worth of books and in your bed by 8.
44 2018-08-08 23:55:04 Essential oil diffuser
45 2018-08-08 23:55:01 It's actually 65 million. And this pipeline gets oil off of rail tracks with are both more dangerous and higher in GHG emissions. This pipeline is not to expand productio, but to efficiently service existing bottlenecked production moved by less desirable means.
46 2018-08-08 23:54:45 Ah, yes. I actually was going to say "if you're comfortable with it" bc I know not everyone uses it. I have one of those Mistos Misters as well. I have olive oil in one -- but that'll def make your treats a little funky.  
47 2018-08-08 23:54:39 Brandon. I work in the oil and gas industry and my boss who is a gay man and good friend are both wearing our #walkaway tee shirts everywhere we go. The gay community is walking away in droves from the Democrats. It’s a beautiful sight to behold.
48 2018-08-08 23:54:36 I'm arguing from both the non-pharma CBD perspective as well as the coming Rx competition. Re fish oil, a bottle of Lovaza pills is like $50 on GoodRx, not much more (maybe less) than 'quality' fish oil at Walgreens (not sure about Costco). Re hydroxyprogesterone pricing\_(ツ)_/¯
49 2018-08-08 23:54:30 the internet tells me it is international cat day, so i feel like i should report that mine just spent 5 minutes licking a bottle of vegetable oil and then tried to eat the air

54 2018-08-08 23:53:57 One would have to wonder if they are trying to bump the price of oil.  May work for a while but impact of renewables is growing sustainably in energy markets and glory days of OPEC are well and truly over
55 2018-08-08 23:53:52 If she is as intelligent as you say why does she avoid talking about the oil sands at all costs. That process is destroying the environment and irreversible
56 2018-08-08 23:53:51 I am looking forward to the day when oil - and Saudi Arabia - becomes irrelevant
57 2018-08-08 23:53:51 lmao I made coconut oil popcorn today because I was thinking about it
58 2018-08-08 23:53:50 No but am not thinking short term but rather picking up stock in international micro-cap E&P's that are being priced at stupid levels. International micro-cap & small-cap oil stocks are the option that never expires. Deep value & diversification provide the margin of safety.

64 2018-08-08 23:53:01 trapped in oil painting, you?
65 2018-08-08 23:52:56 is, and the last thing I want to see is our waters and beaches ruined, our town completely changed by outside oil people, the Gullah culture pushed out on St. Helena Island like it was on HHI. That’s my dystopian nightmare.
66 2018-08-08 23:52:52 @Lucas_Oil I compared your tire shine to 3M. 3m has stayed in 4days, even thru rain, still shines.  Yours only 2days, dry weather,full looking. Applied same way, both sprayed on then used a sponge applicator.
67 2018-08-08 23:52:48 Absolutely beautiful! What medium did you use. Oil, charcoal??? You are fast and talented!
68 2018-08-08 23:52:31 Shea butter, coconut oil, baking soda, and essential oil of your choice. Summer bbq tested and it works!
69 2018-08-08 23:52:31 Who knows anyone who needs a beard model? Just noticing how nice my shitt is and can be marketable to the beard oil and products business.
70 2018-08-08 23:52:30 Too lazy to do my own oil change 
71 2018-08-08 23:52:10 Alex Jones has nothing to do with conservative politics. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Yet it's very telling to see who is rushing to defend and thereby align themselves with this horrifying, hate-filled, vile, snake oil salesman.
72 2018-08-08 23:52:04 The oil industry is insidiously hard to end.  So many things need changing.

74 2018-08-08 23:51:52 They keep calling us stupid. Our leaders have sold their souls for oil deals. That does not mean WE, the people, are stupid. 

Do you see where I'm going with this?
75 2018-08-08 23:51:46 Have you tried essential oil to sleep.
76 2018-08-08 23:51:45 I woke up
Am getting into a healthier sleep pattern
Drank water, coffee, green tea with ginger & more water
Took meds
Talked to a coach
Did yoga feel great
Ate healthy food
Took a walk
Did 30 pushups
Need to meditate
Took cbd oil

85 2018-08-08 23:51:08 @bakewithstork so excited for the coconut oil stork. It's such a great idea. I want to try it :) I keep seeing the advert on Facebook. I want to make the carrot cake receipe  looks divine!

87 2018-08-08 23:51:05 Our 2L class had a class discussion about Mary MacKillop and her qualities and canonisation. They reflected on Mary's image and created portraits using oil pastels.  We have some amazing artists!

89 2018-08-08 23:50:46 If we can get pipelines built & refineries completed then yes.  We only buy 9%-10% of our oil from the Saudis.  We can easily replace that & create jobs.
90 2018-08-08 23:50:39 For one thing, he left an oil stain on my driveway.
91 2018-08-08 23:50:21 You think oil will go down more?
92 2018-08-08 23:50:20 i just dropped a full can of olive oil hair sheen on my foot, that is pain
93 2018-08-08 23:50:14 Tracey, I roast everything but roasted cruciferous veggies are the best! Google is your friend here but I toss with oil, salt&pepper and roast in oven until they are the color I like. Roasted veg get brown with caramelized goodness and they're so good!
94 2018-08-08 23:49:54 having my good name slandered for preaching the truth that wario cums olive oil
95 2018-08-08 23:49:45 I’m literally sweating at the dealer right now hoping my $80 oil change is all they’re gonna try to ring me up for today because I need to sell this bitch in the next 2 months and am not spending anything on repairs right now
96 2018-08-08 23:49:32 The best thing we could do is completely divest ourselves of their oil and replace it with more sustainable energy sources that won't have the oceans overwhelm us.
97 2018-08-08 23:49:27 The 70's was paying off the Vet Nam War, working through an oil embargo, getting off from the gold standard, and impeachment hearings.  All this turmoil lead to high inflation.  America also had no debt at this time.  We were a lender country.  Under Reagan we became a debtor nat

101 2018-08-08 23:49:06 Brad: Read your whole thread. Not a word about easiest, straightest path toward decarbonization available circa 1980.
React properly to TMI and oil/gas supply issues (1971, 1973, 1979). Path would have been same a French, but with a considerable head start.
IOW - build nukes
102 2018-08-08 23:49:03 @carolemacneil All of us need to quit whinging about our hurt feelings that Saudis have said ‘screw you Canada.’ BUILD THE PIPELINE & tell Quebec to get the heck out of the way. The only thing they’ve got that EASTERN Canada needs is oil.
103 2018-08-08 23:48:59 Hmmm... Don't those trains transport a lot of crude oil too?
104 2018-08-08 23:48:45 I also recommend oils! I use vitamin e oil and it helps a lot with scarring and any breakouts
105 2018-08-08 23:48:45 This should hv happened just after 911. Instead the west kept on buying oil under pressure from lobbyists & #Trump like businessmen. Reviewing the tweets supporting #Saudi gov it’s clear they’re paid #Russian trolls who out of starvation are working for these evil #wahabi gov.
106 2018-08-08 23:48:39 Yes, I understand what you mean, but oil is all that they have. Take a look at our GDP and compare it to theirs. It is why I posted it.
107 2018-08-08 23:48:32 It is a French idea. Red potatoes, boiled and peeled. Cut into cubes. Add vinegar, salt, pepper and a touch of olive oil. Touch of finely chopped onion. Tarragon, dill or basil as you like. Toss well. When chilled, add mayo to taste. Adjust seasonings and chill.  #saladecompose
108 2018-08-08 23:48:20 I've tracked portfolios that he's recommended. Some have done pretty well. But I don't think it's substantially different than what others could do. I have made some buys on his recommendation. He's been down on oil and gas for 4 years and I've had my biggest gains in that sector
109 2018-08-08 23:48:18 two new tires plus an oil change  i hate having a car sometimes
110 2018-08-08 23:48:18 Do I have any friends in the Four Corners (UT, CO, AZ, NM) area looking for a job in oil & gas?

111 2018-08-08 23:47:53 Preferably not in their oil though.
112 2018-08-08 23:47:53 Wait until winter get here and they have to pay for that expensive heating oil.  It was really cheaper when @BarackObama was president.  America really miss Obama.
113 2018-08-08 23:47:53 Atleast you don't hear oil drilling machines at 7 i can hear the vibrations within my body
114 2018-08-08 23:47:52 I just found out the othet day that “snake oil” is a problematic term

It was real, and it worked. There is a species of Chinese snake that has a high amount of Omega3s in its.. oil(?) - anyway, tinctures were used as nutrition supplements.

117 2018-08-08 23:47:12 THX! I did an interview with a chef & she said to never use those spray on oils. So I "make" my own spray using a Misto sprayer. I don't like excessive oil in food, but I think the wax paper is a great idea. I also have parchment paper, which should work (I think) next time!
118 2018-08-08 23:47:10 In 12 months , the tarriffs and lower trade will have had an impact on Canadian economy ,. Oil back towards hiigh 50's and with the discount of $30Us per barrell we currently get due to no pipeline and delays will means a weak GDP in 2019 - Tougher job market as election comes
119 2018-08-08 23:46:54 This was not the way to handle any diplomatic relations, she needs to be fired! However f’it, it was said, it is done, we all think it, know it and believe it. So, screw them and their barbaric hatred towards anyone that does not bow down to them. I hear oil is low carb...
120 2018-08-08 23:46:43 It's cast iron, do whatever you want to it once it's seasoned.  Mist of the time mine will rinse clean with some hot water and I just set it back on the burner to air dry.  And grill pans are great, just oil your meat before you throw it on there.

That's what I do.
132 2018-08-08 23:45:23 Even more startling when you factor in the time since @stephenharper  declared us an emerging oil superpower.
133 2018-08-08 23:45:11 Sorry, I thought you were arguing it from a cannabinoid perspective.  They cover Lovaza and I can get fish oil at Costco.
134 2018-08-08 23:45:11 Agreed, they sure are different. One is a 21st Century democracy, the other is an 11th century abomination of a state that imprison, beheads and crucifies petty criminals. Guess which one is still around when oil is obsolete!

141 2018-08-08 23:44:17 God did a lot of great things but he really outdid Himself when he created oil down.
142 2018-08-08 23:44:04 It is time for leaders to stand up against human rights abuses . I don't think Saudi Arabia realizes we have oil .And removing thier students from our universities there is waiting list for classes . Proud to say I'm canadian and to be on the right side of history.
143 2018-08-08 23:44:04 Opposing the burqa is not racist. You could call it religiously intolerant all you want but don’t get on that high horse about protecting Muslims when you bombed the shit out of Libya for oil.
144 2018-08-08 23:44:03 Beg to differ ... 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia .... maybe we can just buy from Exactly where, Iran? Iraq? Yemen? ....
145 2018-08-08 23:44:02 Is it hash oil?
146 2018-08-08 23:43:54 You have some snake oil in that bag of yours?
147 2018-08-08 23:43:51 It would help, Gov. Brown, if you would stop funding the oil companies by driving a gas-burning car. You claim you want to "drive your Crown Vic into the ground", but every time you drive it, you pollute the environment, and every time you buy gas, you fund the oil companies.

154 2018-08-08 23:42:31 My son is in management in an oil company in Calgary and we need the pipe line as Canada is being hosed by the US
155 2018-08-08 23:42:13 @JustinTrudeau 3 steps to deal with Saudi Arabia, fisrt stop selling them arms, second build an oil pipe line from Alberta too the east coast, finally market Canadian oil to the world as democratic, and multicultural

you have to use the Japanese version and lotsa coconut oil
#yourewelcome
162 2018-08-08 23:41:31 Small jar here too. I use a knife to puncture the PB (a few times) so the oil oozes down. Then stir with a knife until smooth. Apply with spoon.
Or get super fresh and mix it by shaking it together.

182 2018-08-08 23:38:55 You are a desert country with only oil. You need Canada more. Without oil, you’d be nothing. Don’t let it get into your head.

186 2018-08-08 23:38:32 You mean Canada didn’t act like a hysterical child as did your oil well dressed up like a country?

when we are done laughing at you, we’ll be sure to remember to care that you exist.
187 2018-08-08 23:38:29 They also do not willingly allow their landbases to be damaged so that other resources—gold, oil, and so on—can be extracted. It follows that those who want the resources will do what they can to destroy traditional communities.
Technology is then anti-volkish by it's nature
188 2018-08-08 23:38:25 We don’t need Saudi oil. “US could easily cover Saudi oil imports to Canada, says Judith Dwarkin of RS Energy Group. Canada can easily replace the oil it imports from Saudi should relations with the Middle Eastern kingdom deteriorate to the point that trade in crude is halted”

191 2018-08-08 23:38:05 Interesting conversation guys and at least one that tries to make sense of a journey based around fact. Oil supplies were important, but it is worth throwing in the death of British Empire, in terms of the financial burden that these colonies came to present. Any thoughts there?

Big pharma, oil, plastics, forestry, and building supplies. Plus others but it would actually help the people much more
196 2018-08-08 23:37:42 Fantastic article and story of Kimon... @PTertzakian do you think saudi will cut all oil to canada? and if so, where does additional supply come from this time?

205 2018-08-08 23:36:26 That's a good question. Why don't we refine our own oil from the oil sands and we wouldn't have get oil from the Saudi's, plus we could create all lot of jobs here.
206 2018-08-08 23:36:15 Whatever happened to “Ethical oil”? Lol!
207 2018-08-08 23:36:02 Fire there ass out the door. Freeze there assets and build an energy east pipeline.  Refine our own oil.  Saudi family is a low life human rights violator.

231 2018-08-08 23:33:52 If you pulled every ounce of oil out of Canada, every penny of investment, every student, and every Saudi national - the collective response (after we died of laughter) would be a giant yawn, then we’d move on & and not notice.
232 2018-08-08 23:33:43 What is with that greasy look republicans seem to love? Maybe it's oil, instead of grease?
233 2018-08-08 23:33:15 Keep in mind that Tesla doesn’t source from conflict areas, and will suspend trading with companies that can not account for the source of cobalt. The oil industry does have issue with people trading oil on the open seas from hand carried oil from places like Syria
234 2018-08-08 23:33:03 Always start with super fresh marshmallows and quality real butter.  And when you go to put them in the pan, grease your hands with olive oil.  This should help with any sticking.   How did I just make Rice Krispy treats sound like a gourmet food?

I was worried sick. I must have been about 11. I took the day off school
246 2018-08-08 23:30:21 the thing is, only stupid oil companies would want to work in California, given all the regulations and interest groups.
247 2018-08-08 23:30:19 Malcolm Turnbull when not taking public transport, drives in cars powered by oil from Saudi Arabia which has women in jail for advocating for women drivers, despite the Saudis changing the law and allowing women to drive.

250 2018-08-08 23:30:04 Good point, but I don’t think it’s possible, unless the state owned enough natural resources (oil, gold, etc.) to be on the economic left, without high taxation; which would be against personal freedom.

The resources would also be state controlled, so also not personal freedom.

262 2018-08-08 23:28:40 Why is the US in the Middle East??? The US is not welcomed by the majority... And many oil rich nations don't want to be extorted to use US based oil industry or money... Just ask Iraq, Libya, Syria or Venezuela...

267 2018-08-08 23:27:50 Oil's easy to extract. I just go over to the neighbor's, crawl under his giant pickup, pull the drain plug, and fill my bucket. There's always some left over, which I kind of feel guilty about. On the other hand, my garden's a disaster.
268 2018-08-08 23:27:42 I think she’ll just end up being flawed, like Obama and drones, or Trudeau and oil. Like—still up there for a politician, but not perfect. The bigger question is whether she will be given a pass like male politicians or dragged like Gillard for the carbon tax.

284 2018-08-08 23:25:29 Give me an example of something we can buy cheaper from the rest of the world.

For example. Let's say I want to make Spag Bol:

Currently: 

Beef: Ireland
Plum tomatoes: Italy
Spaghetti: Italy
Onions: Spain
Garlic: Spain
Olive Oil: Spain
Parmesan: Italy
285 2018-08-08 23:25:26 Water is the new ‘oil!’
286 2018-08-08 23:25:23 Trudy will never go for that. The east would rather get their oil from Venezuela or someone other than Alberta.
287 2018-08-08 23:25:22 That's easy. It's an oil stain. Looks like a '57 Bantam D3 
288 2018-08-08 23:25:21 OKAY…  GOT IT… SHARING 
Yes, who knows when they will catch up.. SINCE THEY HAVENT yet picked up the APRIL 27, 2016 SecretMetting at #MayflowerHotel, or #Qatar OIL DEAL even though it was in the STEELE DOSSIER! 
Let alone the DEC 12 TowerMeeting and TRESON on TV by CarterPage
289 2018-08-08 23:24:58 Trying to stay sober, be happy, be patient with people, and work 40 hours a week goes together like oil and water
290 2018-08-08 23:24:58 So my baby is spending a couple days with her grandma. Now, y’all know our eczema struggle and how meat and dairy make her skin flare up.... well I walk in the door and what’s being cooked? 

Sausage with cheese. 

At least I brought the Sea Moss soap and Relief Oil 
291 2018-08-08 23:24:56 Considering overwhelming support for all his programs: medicare for all/tuition free college/ending wars/$15 minimum wage/eliminate fracking/big oil/breaking up banks. Why dems REALLY reject him for his campaign finance stance. but they won't outright say it b/c $$$
292 2018-08-08 23:24:53 Dictator does what!!!! Well what can we expect from oppressive government like Saudi Arabia? Canada should stand strong even if other nations bow to Oil and money.
293 2018-08-08 23:24:52 This is another spoiled child of Middle East. Completely worth nothing without USA cooperation. Has oil money, but it will be losing it in the next 10 to 20 years due to restrictions and total bans to Fossil fuels. All the gulf states have no idea about rights, its impact on Eco.
294 2018-08-08 23:24:38 100% with you on this,David. Saudis are perpetrating genocide against #Yemen using CDN weapons. We have enough oil to power the rest of the world, yet lack of pipelines means we buy oil from this disgusting dictatorship.
295 2018-08-08 23:24:21 I have a lot of patience when it comes to people but my oil change was done in ten mins and ive been here an hour and a half cause they still haven’t taken my car out from the space. I got errands yo
296 2018-08-08 23:24:13 Canada has proven oil supplies as large as the Saudis. Then you've got Norway and the UK. If you'd like to switch to buying from other dictatorships there is Venezuela, Russian and Iran.
297 2018-08-08 23:24:07 Father of all lies. The energy ministry has negated the tall claim made by the caretaker Minister for Maritime Affairs and Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Hussain Haroon that the US energy giant is ‘close to discovering’ oil reserves bigger than Kuwait in Pakistan.
298 2018-08-08 23:24:05 "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." ~Psalms 45:7 #Jesus #God #Bible
299 2018-08-08 23:24:01 Anyone who doesn't have a domestic supply of Oil will remain conspicuously silent, which includes most of NATO. To think otherwise is naive.
300 2018-08-08 23:23:40 If anyone out there (esp vegans) is looking for an unreal, inexpensive, cruelty free makeup remover straight up coconut oil is unreal 
301 2018-08-08 23:23:27 I heard about a drug trial overseas to see if applying the stuff they add to oil to reduce frothing in a fryer will grow hair back.
302 2018-08-08 23:23:19 Ask him about the Saudi fracas. We haven't heard if he supports Canada or the Saudis and his Oil Baron masters.
303 2018-08-08 23:23:12 You have transformed my life 
I'm so thankful...
Glory to God...I'm ready 4 more change...More Oil...I receive
Looking forward to it..
I pray that Ur enjoying ur Day/Evening....
Wit Ur Fine Glorious Self...
304 2018-08-08 23:23:12 @GOP BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Rememeber this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault.
305 2018-08-08 23:23:12 @JustinTrudeau is so bold about KSA spat because he has Alberta oil to fall back on.
306 2018-08-08 23:23:10 The oil fire!
307 2018-08-08 23:23:00 Okay so now both my service engine light and oil light are on so who wants to make bets on when I’m gonna die?
308 2018-08-08 23:22:51 The crew who changed my oil forgot four bolts on the skid plate underneath my car and so wee-who I just had an adventure on Highway 280.
309 2018-08-08 23:21:59 STOP THIS TERRORIST NO OIL OPEN LAND PEOPLE WAKE UP AND VOTE VOTE VOYE
310 2018-08-08 23:21:47 My favorite keto-dessert? Blending a protein shake with ice and a little MCT oil powder with some ice... tastes like a yummy milkshake depending on the flavor lol.

312 2018-08-08 23:21:40 I get plasmapheresis treatments 5 times every month..I call them my "oil changes"
313 2018-08-08 23:21:29 Coming from a country still have public executions, if it wasn't for their oil it would exist...hope they run out some day...
314 2018-08-08 23:21:27 I accuse Colonel Olive oil of committing the crime in the on the bridge with the knife!
315 2018-08-08 23:21:22 Shit had my skin smooth af. It was just too high so i went back to baby oil gel
316 2018-08-08 23:21:09 Yea but you buy 43% of your oil from Canada. No need to worry
317 2018-08-08 23:21:07 I’m a month and 500 miles past due for an oil change and basically my car is going to explode because I have NO TIME
318 2018-08-08 23:21:02 Iran eğer perslerden başlatırsak en az 400o yıllık bir uygarlıktır. That is the biggest asset of Iran . More than oil and gas.
319 2018-08-08 23:21:02 They were blocked on every turn by LIBs, NDP, environmentalists, FN not involved in oil & gas, Prov govts.
320 2018-08-08 23:20:59 Is this connected to facts published in the last two months on the Saudis keeping oil prices stable if Trump scraps Iran deal?
321 2018-08-08 23:20:51 (curls tail over self, rests chin on hands and elbows atop tail) nobody wants to slag off saudi because it's an oil provider, and canada runs 66% of its energy on renewable sources

it says something, then, how canada's allies are so accepting of SA's fascistic hegemony
322 2018-08-08 23:20:49 Bitches mix feelings wit business that’s like mixing water wit oil

324 2018-08-08 23:20:38 Psssst...if u make them yourself...no one will ever know. 1. Purchase a can of biscuits 2. Preheat generous amount of oil  3. Cut centers out of biscuits 4. Cook until golden brown 5. Sprinkle with regular or powdered sugar. Centers can be cooked & rolled in sugar if desired.

327 2018-08-08 23:19:41 Here's a little life hack for ya, heat up your pan or skillet before putting the oil in.  Just a little Nadia Brand Tipperooski

329 2018-08-08 23:19:34 I just listened to a 15 minute rant by my 85 year old grandma about how hotdog buns are made shorter than they were in her time. Give elders their respect. They earned it.

334 2018-08-08 23:19:14 but i dont have any olive oil
335 2018-08-08 23:18:58 Balanced Budget Hannibal? Only by clawing back money from Disabled, Vets, FN etc + incl revenue from sale of GM shares *at a LOSS*. AND Adding $160 Billion to our National Debt! AND leaving a crumbling Infrastructure + lousy Economy based on OIL! LEARN some FACTs! Silly dumb #CON
336 2018-08-08 23:18:53 @venus_trading looking to sell oil back down to today’s low?
337 2018-08-08 23:18:40 そう、そうなんですよ！！！！！！
338 2018-08-08 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
339 2018-08-08 23:18:36 Jesus Christ, Tay. My eyes! *flickers oil*
340 2018-08-08 23:18:05 As i walk out my apartment into the heat wave thinking, "ah yes, the coconut oil in my body butter should cook me nicely." ☆
341 2018-08-08 23:17:54 Facts. I was looking at different things you can use as deodorant. They said you can use coconut oil as deodorant
342 2018-08-08 23:17:48 Right, bribery over oil leases or drilling rights or something. Same old song and dance. 
343 2018-08-08 23:17:40 Ok, sure. Just as soon as anyone else who gets government subsidies (farmers, oil companies, big financial corporations) are held to the same standard.
344 2018-08-08 23:17:32 Olive oil
345 2018-08-08 23:17:18 I just hope this brings to light how insane it is for Canada to importing oil from other countries especially since they are not nearly as environmentally or socially responsible.
346 2018-08-08 23:17:17 Besides this is all big conspiracy orchestrated by Alex Jones to make himself relevant again, increase his app downloads and sell snake oil. Conspiracy, I tell you!
347 2018-08-08 23:17:05 Cool. Did you catch his name? I couldn’t help but notice how many Alberta oil & gas guys there were on the trail. Very interesting talking with them. Nice to hear from you too!
348 2018-08-08 23:16:57 Right. I hate to break it to you but No one cares about Saudi Arabia. Trade is absolutely minimal, nothing necessary comes out of Saudi Arabia. Oh yea, you have oil. What a minute, we do too!

350 2018-08-08 23:16:45 all this bragging from the snake oil salesman @EddieHearn about DAZN and he puts together 2 of the worst fights in recent memory. @BIGBABYMILLER against Adamek and @JVargasBoxing vs Dulorme. He should be ashamed of himself.
351 2018-08-08 23:16:44 I did read an article about the Saudi Prince and the Emirates cutting a deal with trump against Iran, so maybe this is legitimate after all!! The Saudi ‘s want the market on oil, so cutting Iran off hurts their oil from being sold!!
352 2018-08-08 23:16:43 Just saw a Pin claiming that tooth decay can be reversed with a paste of turmeric and clove oil.

People, the human race will never move past magical thought. It's in our DNA.

355 2018-08-08 23:16:17 No position, but interested to see how Kelt Exploration ( $KEL ) does on earnings.They are projecting some big increases this year. Will be interesting to see if they deliver and on top of that, if they make money. Projecting 50-60% increase in Oil bbls/d.
356 2018-08-08 23:16:08 Lol the one that’s mixed with God’s blessing, coconut oil, & a good squat 
357 2018-08-08 23:15:32 Not necessarily porn......it could be the petrochemical industry. You can’t write Shell Oil on an abacus either. Neither can you write it on boobies tbh.

363 2018-08-08 23:14:53 When it comes right to it we should ask the fishermen of the gulf coast how much they like oil.

366 2018-08-08 23:14:44 I know this is not the whole point of discussion, but seriously, why doesn’t Canada utilize those huge reserves of oil and build that eastern pipleline? It’s mind-boggling, really.

You are all making a mockery of Federalism & NG in the comity of nations by your gangsterism 

It is against the principle of natural law for the rogue & illegal FG TO nationalize the oil resources of the ND.....3/
369 2018-08-08 23:14:33 "Exxon Mobil is close to discover huge oil reserves
near the Pak-Iran border, which could be even bigger than the Kuwaiti reserves".
370 2018-08-08 23:14:28 You should be much more worried about unescorted, single hull cruise ships carrying a couple million litres of bunker diesel instead of double hulled tankers with two tugs. In fact, none of the worst spills in this area have been tankers, but instead other ships spilling fuel oil
371 2018-08-08 23:14:13 The irony is the tariffs give a boost to paying for oil with the yuan.
372 2018-08-08 23:14:11 Too bad. So they get the light armoured vehicles and Canadian oil import money. How lovely.
373 2018-08-08 23:14:07 you say that but what are they doing in reality.. committing genocide in the middle east to secure supply for oil companies. any non-white person will tell you the US is an apartheid nation. the fundamentalist right in the US is already fascist in its belief in entrenched power
374 2018-08-08 23:14:00 put on coconut oil earlier and now maggie is following me around like i’m a human popsicle
375 2018-08-08 23:13:54 While I think this was handled unimaginably badly, for me 2 facts remain, 1 this is a terrible regime, 2 we don’t need their oil and it’s total bs we haven’t dealt with that. Ok that’s sort of 3

379 2018-08-08 23:13:20 If/when Tesla meets quarterly planned performance, shorts won't be effective.
Assuming the oil and gas industry is doing what it can to delay electric, they won't be futzing with shorting the stock.
Being private won't stop bad press and rumor mongering.
380 2018-08-08 23:13:10 Sanctions didn't start until 2014, and that was to prevent government officials from stashing cash in US banks. PdVSA went from being an oil company to slush fund, their oil production has been falling for years. Blame poor policy and management
381 2018-08-08 23:13:08 im sorry how is that an indiction the gulf is oil based? investments are a sanctioned part of the budget btw. dubai has it at 6% of gdp. despite similar gdp to canada saudi arabia doesnt have to worry about 1.8 trillion in public debts :) 200 billion never sounded so little
382 2018-08-08 23:12:58 They are still selling oil to us, which we should stop buying, and they won’t take our grain which will only hurt them. So I am okay with standing our ground against a tyrannical theocracy.
383 2018-08-08 23:12:54 I believe Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world
384 2018-08-08 23:12:53 The seasons bout to change, I need a new moisturizing oil that’s all-purpose. Hair, scalp, body, errthing lol
385 2018-08-08 23:12:52 I've asked this question before, too. Maybe they have oil rigs on their land like a lot of Alberta farms/homesteads do, we just never see them?
386 2018-08-08 23:12:41 Olive oil is too skinny for me I need some meat on the bone

390 2018-08-08 23:12:00 wow then what will happen to oil & gas industry alongside biodiesel?
391 2018-08-08 23:11:53 It’s bad when the prices are kept low from economies of scale. Breaking up bell telecom dramatically increased prices. Same with standard oil.
392 2018-08-08 23:11:43 I’m def looking forward to tapping into the Lionsgate portal during meditation at 8pm. I have my lavender oil readaaaayyyy
393 2018-08-08 23:11:28 Okay. Let's get over with it. 

Shea butter is good for your skin
Coconut oil is just as magical as olive oil, sesame oil, groundnut oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, grape oil, palm kernal oil etc. 

Use them!
394 2018-08-08 23:11:25 working for an oil drilling or fracking company gets you paid but those hours are so long
395 2018-08-08 23:11:19 Hey now, man, the Arabs did everything with their oil except discover it, discover a use for it, discover a way to get it out of the ground, invent the vehicles that run on it, and create the free market that allows for lucrative and secure trade in it.

406 2018-08-08 23:09:55 I drive a 4 cylinder car, watch my heating bills and anything that will reduce my carbon footprint. I guess the Soviet and US bombing of Syria and the Saudi oil doesn't mean much against my polluting of the atmosphere.
407 2018-08-08 23:09:39 We have our own oil. We have our own water. We have a democracy. We educate students from around the world…we will not miss the Saudis. We simply told men to stop treating women like shit. F-ck ‘em if they can’t take a joke…as we say in the Maritimes. 
408 2018-08-08 23:09:35 For myself, I was using a laundry detergent scented with orange oil, eating an orange a day, and drinking tea flavoured with citrus oils, which sensitized me.

414 2018-08-08 23:09:08 Let's all change to electric and fuel oil for central heating. Then they can charge what they like for gas coz no one will be using it. Start mining coal to help generate more electricity. Creates jobs in the UK too.

419 2018-08-08 23:08:15 Curious who the other advertisers were who complained? 
I still love that this sits next to a Sinclair sign (tho I haven’t researched whether or not the gas/oil chain is associated w/ “that” Sinclair).

421 2018-08-08 23:07:47 For us amateurs, why would those Arab countries want the Iran deal dead and sanctions reimposed?  Oil sales?
422 2018-08-08 23:07:46 Yeah, Central Valley, vote for your man to put an oil well in your backyard.
423 2018-08-08 23:07:43 False info? Like the fact Saudi Arabia occupied and annexed three Yemeni provinces. You guys really better pray, the West never stops buying oil.
424 2018-08-08 23:07:39 @PMOIndia @PiyushGoyal @Swamy39 Oil prices down.Pls Lower petrol prices.Forget semi literate oficers Who ruind economy.Last chance fr BJP
425 2018-08-08 23:07:38 Except the Turks. You did bow down to the Turks. Then you danced for the British and lived off their gold until they helped get rid of the Turks and provided the engineering expertise to build your oil infrastructure. Then you all basically went on welfare, hired foreign labour.
426 2018-08-08 23:07:38 You say this every time but when they said it it was the optimism of becoming a socialist country but it was never allowed to be that country. There was too much American thwarting over rule & oil. This you know already &academics can argue this as being the case better than I.
427 2018-08-08 23:07:35 Saudi Energy Minister says his country will not use oil as a weapon in its crisis with Canada.

432 2018-08-08 23:07:17 Apparently, 2 of my favorite restaurants, @FiveGuys and @ChickfilA both use peanut oil to cook their foods. Sorry to everyone with peanut allergies who can't enjoy these delicacies!

470 2018-08-08 23:03:12 No one should buy Saudi Oil until they change their human rights abuses similar to Israel.  No wonder they became allies. Trudeau should ought to focus more on internal issues in Canada like illegal migrants crossing from U.S boarders. Perhaps he should close U.S boarders.

476 2018-08-08 23:02:42 Saudi realized that they should be more careful about their international commitments.
Had the Saudis not fullfiled their oil supplies to Canada , it would have damaged their economical obligations to the world.
Saudi’d already damaged their image.
Foolish diplomacy

477 2018-08-08 23:02:41 This statement is often quoted by food-and-farm activists & attributed to Kissinger. “Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control the people.” I've never been able to find the source, but most of us agree with it. Water is definitely part of the food system.

509 2018-08-08 22:59:44 nutritional value as a function of work that life form put in its production. fish is primitive and low in nutrition. so is meat (most of its value comes from oil it is roasted with). high quality dark chocolate is the best food one can buy in a grocery store (cocoa is great)

518 2018-08-08 22:58:25 No, the Iranian sanctions prevent them from selling as much oil/gas they have, so SAUDIs benefit by less competition, DT takes out their competitors while pretending that it’s because Obama made a “bad deal” tho we know it ain’t that, this is extortion/bribery at highest levels
519 2018-08-08 22:58:14 Thank-you, I agree. I do not wish that either. I do not want the people of Saudi Arabia to suffer. Most economies, including Canada need to diversify away from oil. Sincerely, even though we may disagree on topics, I do not wish suffering to anyone, and apologize for implying it.
520 2018-08-08 22:57:59 They'll probably back down eventually. But they have no reason to. The economic impact is so small in overall picture. And eastern Canada should buy oil from Alberta and not unethical sauda oil.
521 2018-08-08 22:57:56 What breaks my heart is that most of the wars these beautiful young men and women died in are only for power, oil, influence in a region.
And they are left out in the cold when they return, scarred by what they have experienced. 
As a mother, my heart mourns with you.

526 2018-08-08 22:57:21 Hahaha Canadian trade with Saudi Arabia is not that big, we'll live and probably be better off and the ammount of oil we get from them can easily be replaced ...we have I believe 2nd or 3rd most oil in the world

540 2018-08-08 22:55:12 Iranian oil would be an option. Venezuelan oil would be cheap and it would help them pay for their collapsing social system. It would help the Latin American zone instead.
541 2018-08-08 22:55:08 If Canada & the US would ween off of Saudi oil, perhaps we wouldn't have to even bother reacting to the tantrums. Not building EE pipe was short sighted by the govt.

546 2018-08-08 22:54:12 True but outside its native environment it's profoundly disruptive. Its prized oil makes any forest fire into an inferno that damages native trees and its ash poisons the soil preventing surviving plants from growing and seeds sprouting, except its own.
547 2018-08-08 22:54:10 So the Corps that actually cause Climate Change get a completely free pass...how convenient! Seems there is always someone to pass the blame on...while Billionaire keep pumping their oil. This is a sideshow.
548 2018-08-08 22:53:49 Yup. People imagine it’s like oil with well lives in decades but it’s not; it’s over before you know it and the owners have scarpered with the money and left us a ruined land.

552 2018-08-08 22:52:58 lol Canada has oil to last hundreds of years.  They need nothing from Saudi Arabia.  We have actual women, we don't need camel beauty contests and lazy, useless workers who marry their cousins and import slaves from South East Asia to pick up their garbage fro them.  Saudi sucks.
553 2018-08-08 22:52:53 I once walked into my room at the forge and Alex was sniffing a cod liver oil tablet that id left on my bedside table. I didn’t even ask him to do he just did it
554 2018-08-08 22:52:50 Trudeau needs to fill his re-election coffers, and by picking a fight with Saudi Arabia which will give him a reason to develop Canadian oil, he is counting on getting big $$ from industry, and minimal backlash from his leftist supporters on the environment. All planned.

565 2018-08-08 22:51:34 our oil revenue per capita is peanut compared to those countries
566 2018-08-08 22:51:30 That's not the whole story. Whereas Norwegians didn't subsidize its tax-rates using oil and gas revenues, AB propped up its frankly stupid flat-tax and no PST "AB Advantage" using income from the Heritage Trust Fund, even in good years - hence, little growth in the latter.
567 2018-08-08 22:51:28 He doesn't care about Saudi human rights, He wants Saudi to stop providing canda with oil so he can justify fracking and building the pipeline in Canada which he promised will not do before he was elected.

573 2018-08-08 22:50:35 In article: only 90% recovery in ideal conditions from the last TM spill... pollution of oil toxifies 30kL H2O/litre of oil. 10tonnes unrecovered = 300kT or 300 000 000L of toxic water
574 2018-08-08 22:50:33 From coconut to sesame to palm kernel to etc oil. After some months of deliberation I decided to try my experiment out and promised never to tell anyone unless the outcome is positive.

576 2018-08-08 22:50:13 And, I say this as someone who supports carbon pricing (with rebates to reduce regressiveness at the low income end). Perhaps we should not be buying oil infrastructure, or giving BC nat gas producers massive royalty/tax breaks

580 2018-08-08 22:49:48 The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 

So we can stop importing Saudi Oil ASAP!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.

585 2018-08-08 22:49:02 I heard Black cumin seed  oil taste peppery, i wonder if it would go good with grits
586 2018-08-08 22:49:00 are we still in 70s? today oil is a marginal amount of the golf's gdp. most is tied to an investment economy. did you think you were the only geniuses to realize oil & gas were limited? trillions in trade ships pass via the gulf. then there's the suez canal & indonesia & allies
587 2018-08-08 22:48:55 Typical Norwegian family's share in national investment fund derived from oil & gas about $1.2 million. Alberta family's share of Heritage Fund is about $17,800 but even that misleads because AB has budgeted for deficits of about $25 bn in last 3 years. #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
588 2018-08-08 22:48:54 well theres oil in it so you know us americans are all over it
589 2018-08-08 22:48:50 If we@actually needed oil on east coast we’d be better off ramping up NL offshore development. For less than cost of EE we can have deep water oil viable at <$50/bbl.
590 2018-08-08 22:48:44 This piece didn't include the "made in Canada" price Pierre Trudeau laid on AB oil in the 1980s. Eastern Canada sure liked the discount back then--too bad we didn't have the courage in Western Canada to sort out our role in Confederation.

595 2018-08-08 22:48:12 nice version pity that rocket burnt so much oil 
596 2018-08-08 22:47:49 Yes, ‘cause DT would probably negotiate a % for himself, then both countries make TRILLIONS more in oil/gas in next few years, DT LEAVES as a Multi-billionaire ON OUR BACKS,leaves U.S.A. broke & alone in the world #ThanksDonald
597 2018-08-08 22:47:29 The problem is, most Republicans really seem to like snake oil.
598 2018-08-08 22:47:17 He isn't a snake oil salesman.  He's not that respectable.  Trump sales timeshares in the temporary look at some sand that may one day be made into a bottle that could eventually hold a liquid that might be snake oil.

599 2018-08-08 22:47:14 ...& leeches & mummia at pharmacies
I mean, it's not like the snake oil salesmen ever disappeared from society, they just changed hats...
600 2018-08-08 22:47:10 I learned how to change my own oil  so proud of myself
601 2018-08-08 22:47:10 69 was crashed - sad end to my favorite model. Other car pulled out of side street and took off my front end.

So I put that 351 engine into 65 (289 oil pump failure). Drove 3 years then gave to friend with car shop. It was badly rusted/unsafe. He sold to someone for parts.
602 2018-08-08 22:47:08 And also have the largest oil/gold reserves in the world,  surrounded by 7 bases of USA in our sisterly  republic  Colombia. No worries,  we also can enjoy of the different  hair straightening methods, as well as a free universities. And we will continue our road to socialism...
603 2018-08-08 22:46:50 That's nothing but an American smear campaign to damage our oil industry. Oil sands is not even close to the dirtiest oil in the world and is far more ethical and our environmental standards are far above anywhere else in the world
604 2018-08-08 22:46:35 Agreed. The Harper era was way too supportive of Saudi oil.
605 2018-08-08 22:46:29 Best keep taking my cod liver oil tablets then, to remain supple.
606 2018-08-08 22:46:22 You know that rollback of fuel economy rules? That's an extra half trillion in the pockets of Big Oil - and 13,000 Americans in an early grave from worsening air quality. Way to make America great! Shill for Big Oil even if it kills tens of thousands! #Resist #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW

611 2018-08-08 22:45:50 Well, they are the "only" thing I grow regularly in my back yard for that reason. Tho I have been adding basil and peppers lately, because add a little olive oil, salt and pepper...
612 2018-08-08 22:45:48 Definitely light oil rub at the end

628 2018-08-08 22:44:36 Is that cooking oil
629 2018-08-08 22:44:27 Brilliant point of contrast. Where’s the oil though, I would ask.
630 2018-08-08 22:44:26 New freeway? No problem. Gov't subsidized oil and gas? Hell yeah. Public transit, oh no we can't do that. Cut funding and raise fares.
631 2018-08-08 22:44:23 @AdamRRowe hey Adam. I saw your article on vc firms in Miami. Nice!!! Do you happen to know any VC firms that are interested in oil trading business (Latin america)?
632 2018-08-08 22:44:18 They just seem to want to undo all of our attempts to fix things. Flint gets almost no $ for water! Cali’s fires are your own fault! Let’s burn more oil! The new non-crooked EPA guy is an actual professional fossil fuels lobbyist.
WTF. I’m tired.
633 2018-08-08 22:44:08 I can vouch for the efficacy of lavender oil on insect bites. Completely stops the itching.
634 2018-08-08 22:43:41 Sometimes you read of advancements and developments in countries with the biggest crude oil reserves like Canada, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (even Qatar that doesn’t have as much reserves as we do) and you wonder if Nigeria has been selling groundnut oil to the rest of the world.
635 2018-08-08 22:43:26 Good..now let's not sell them any more war machine's either..why should we even care?..oh yeah oil and cash..thats the only reason were hooked into them..greed begot greed...evil very evil.

638 2018-08-08 22:42:54 If they said they’d get you in, yes. As far as open bays, most shops have a dedicated lane for oil changes and the other mechanics don’t want to bother with that work.
639 2018-08-08 22:42:47 Yes, they really should have foreseen how a president elected a year after their term began would scapegoat immigrants to the point that people who previously felt safe in the USA would feel the need to run to our country. How foolish to not plan for a dangerous buffoon in power.
640 2018-08-08 22:42:42 I wish coconut oil never existed :(
641 2018-08-08 22:42:38 I heat water in mine, pour it out, brush it down then wipe it dry. Sometimes I heat it up afterwards, put like a tblspn of oil, let it cool then wipe it. Never use soap.
642 2018-08-08 22:42:29 Great news. No need to import coal or oil.
643 2018-08-08 22:42:26 The pushback from the Saudi’s is what I was talking about. Trudeau and his Liberals are becoming hard for the world to deal with. The Saudis are acting no different towards women than they did 100 tankers of oil ago. The biggest point backs Iran an enemy of the Saudi’s
644 2018-08-08 22:42:14 That's grim, I had a oil service, the place was covered in dog mess, kitchen units had mouse droppings everywhere. Dirty dishes everywhere and my feet were sticking to the floor. She actually said "you're not going to make a mess?" The smell was quite intense.

653 2018-08-08 22:41:08 so no salt water, just peroxide & tea tree oil. how long did it take for it to go away? bc i know my nose piercing did the same thing & it cleared up the bump & my belly button piercing was a disaster.
654 2018-08-08 22:41:00 The problem is the oil used to cook food in restaurants in California.  When my relatives from the South visit, they always tell me that the food tastes weird.
655 2018-08-08 22:40:53 Went to a place to get my oil changed and was there an hour and a half before they closed but was told I was too late and they could not get me in. 

2 openings in shop one car getting worked on and one car in front of me.

Is it unreasonable for me to be mad about that?

670 2018-08-08 22:39:40 Why not? The dinosaurs drilled for and burned all the oil and gas on the planet too?
671 2018-08-08 22:39:33 You have oil. That's it. The prices will never return, your days as a rich country are ending. Worry about yourself. We are a country that has value in resources that utilize trading routes. You have a dying economy that's days are numbered.
672 2018-08-08 22:39:04 my belly button did the same,  but I put peroxide and tea tree oil mines went away. Clean it 2times a day! When you wake up and when you go to sleep. Salt water did nothing but made my piercing worst .

682 2018-08-08 22:37:16 No really, it's just that when the royal family found the oil, they shared it with everyone and were the first to build schools for us and hospitals in 1930. The Ottoman empire treated us (Native people) bad with the support of Great Britain.
683 2018-08-08 22:37:13 Um I use coconut oil for everythingg. My hair, skin, to take my makeup off so yess. If you're around animals tho they for sure going to try to eat your hair
684 2018-08-08 22:37:05 EVEN MORE Products By “I Cant Believe Its Not Butter” 
- I Have Reservations About Whipped Oil
- I’d Be Willing To Bet This Isn’t Healthy 
- I’m A Sucker For Polyunsaturated Fats 
- I Can Never Remember If Canola Is The Good One 
- I Honestly Don’t Understand My Weight Problem
685 2018-08-08 22:37:00 Pretty much.  The irony of it is that it's taking place on Facebook on post about just how inclusive the oil industry is of LGBTQ people 
686 2018-08-08 22:36:45 The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 
So we can stop importing Saudi Oil ASAP!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.
687 2018-08-08 22:36:44 Any oil extracts need some heavy oversight if it's going to be legalized, it's not unheard of for an advertised CBD product to contain some or mostly THC.
688 2018-08-08 22:36:31 Hilarious listening to the left talk now about “human rights violations” “freedom of speech”, while completely in support of blocking Canadian pipelines while we continue to import Saudi oil.
689 2018-08-08 22:36:11 Republicans dont have blood in their veins - oil.
690 2018-08-08 22:36:10 What? Really? He always sounds like a snake oil salesman, but guess I'll have to listen to this interview and find out if that's true.
691 2018-08-08 22:36:02 Allah gave you oil as he gave nothing to others just as a mean for a test. Clearly your kings are failing. From East to West the Muslim Ummah is not in love with your failed kings and his puppet . Very sad 
692 2018-08-08 22:35:52 Coconut oil not even shea butter
693 2018-08-08 22:35:44 Stop buying oil from them!
694 2018-08-08 22:35:43 If coconut oil, green tea, honey, or lemon, or any combination of those, can't solve your problem I hate to break it to you but your fucked. RIP my guy.
695 2018-08-08 22:35:27 SO happy I was able to get a pedicure and get an oil change today! two things I don't have to worry about tomorrow before AC!
696 2018-08-08 22:35:10 LMAO
697 2018-08-08 22:34:52 One is an AHA cleanser and the other is like a airy foam cleanser. I wouldn’t double cleanse with both of them because it’s not needed. I would do like an oil cleanser first then the AHA cleanser in the morning then for night just switch to the foam cleanser after an oil cleanser
698 2018-08-08 22:34:37 I’m the same with the olive oil and the bread thing :(
699 2018-08-08 22:34:37 I use 1T olive oil, 2T honey and one egg , beat until white with a fork, massage into hair, leave on 20 minutes ( I take this time to shave ) and then rinse off with warm water and brush while still in the shower. Plus your natural oils your hair makes it works very well.
700 2018-08-08 22:34:22 I mean, even just fried on oil, chicken is pretty good when mixed with veggies and rice
701 2018-08-08 22:34:16 #Zendaya ... Treating the pimples is fine, but the keep coming back. But if you treat the CAUSE of pimples now you've nailed the problem forever.  /// 1. Replace BUTTER &MARGARINE  with Olive oil & Coconut oils. 2. Minimize Sugar intake with candies/ junk foods. 
702 2018-08-08 22:33:58 i wanna be a blanket burrito for the rrst of the day  but i need to do an oil change for moms friend?????

710 2018-08-08 22:32:47 I LOVE how the church provides in times of need. 

I got a request to anoint somebody while I was in Denver at the baseball game. I didn’t have my oils on me. (Mea culpa) So I got a to go container of olive oil from the pizza stand at the ballpark...
711 2018-08-08 22:32:35 Screw big government interfering in our lives. Now you can't buy a lightbulb for under $8. Tungsten bulbs are all but gone and everything is an LED at triple the cost. There's no shortage of energy anymore. We're swimming in oil reserves & natural gas. Give it a rest Big Brother.
712 2018-08-08 22:32:02 Oh! The The! And I have Infected on CD. *hangs head in shame* I do have Beds Are Burning on download, but alas. That really was the extent of Midnight Oil here. Is Peter Garrett still in parliament?
713 2018-08-08 22:31:58 I've heard of the tea! I might pick some up in the morning. I'm taking evening primrose oil as of today too
714 2018-08-08 22:31:51 Why some Italian restaurants let east side Mario’s do it to em by not immediately bringing me free bread + oil/vinegar
715 2018-08-08 22:31:49 お願いします！お願いします！お願いします！
716 2018-08-08 22:31:39 I got hot pepper oil in my nostril and I don't know what to do help oh my god I'm going to die
717 2018-08-08 22:31:37 I'm confused on how MN. can call itself a "green economy". This is stupid, when our entire transport system relies on imported oil and ethanol. It takes 10 gals.of water to make a gallon of ethanol. Not to mention, it's made from corn, a staple food.
718 2018-08-08 22:31:27 Another thing... you'd be surprised how many islanders didn't know making coconut oil was that easy. Use heat <50° (put a bowl of lolo in the sun instead of high heat like the video) and you can call it Virgin Coconut Oil!
719 2018-08-08 22:31:03 surely the rich arab countries are behind all this with the money and oil they have! they must be paying out huge amounts of cash to someone to keep promoting this white genocide, i think so
720 2018-08-08 22:31:02 Seriously??? There have *always* been people like Jones. There were charlatan preachers and revivalists. There where flim flam men, hucksters and snake oil salesmen that traveled from town to town in brightly covered wagons. Radio and then late nite TV brought a raft of them!
721 2018-08-08 22:31:01 Iran is a different oil than Canadian bitumen is. Ours is high sulphur low grade machine oil and Iran is oil that is used for gasoline type products. Ours is also$20 or more less than West Texas oil before discounts which by the way are government subsidies so it is Trudeau.
722 2018-08-08 22:30:40 You either like it or not: Saudi Arabia is strong by Islam , royalty and citizens and we don’t care if others don’t like us . Allah gove us that oil & ..... . Actions are talking louder than words.
723 2018-08-08 22:30:38 It was the Holly Oil Refinery.

729 2018-08-08 22:29:52 Mercifully there is a sustainably sourced palm oil alternative to Nutella so we can survive this!! 
730 2018-08-08 22:29:46 I can't imagine what he's doing. In his world, we all drink mercury, give our children toys with lead based paint, and breathe in asbestos! OH... drill and run oil pipes through all national parks and lands. 

And he's working hard to take away our medical care that we'll need.
731 2018-08-08 22:29:42 Listen!!!
Unless Trump forbids all countries from buying Iranian oil, nothing will change!!!

If a country buys Iranian oil, we must end all trade with them.
732 2018-08-08 22:29:40 Haha yes I really wonder if he is honest and just really bad at debates or he is a dishonest snake oil salesman
733 2018-08-08 22:29:38 No because we keep using oil to burn the fuel to make your damn cookies!
734 2018-08-08 22:29:31 I'm sorry, you forgot Clinton was Mrs. Fracking Queen?

Reason they didn't vote Democrat is that reason....and Obama opened up the arctic to drilling for oil.  TWICE.

Maybe those that didn't vote Democrat are more informed on their policies?

Do I need to mention #StandingRock
735 2018-08-08 22:29:24 Fracking?  Distractions? No more Trans Atlantic Oil?
736 2018-08-08 22:29:20 Freedom of Oil money, Freedom to get an education? There must be more to this story than Saudi is ready to admit to. Maybe getting kiddos in safe place before the big conflict with Shia-guys
737 2018-08-08 22:29:17 Fuck you guys and your oil prices  #رسميا_عموري_لاعبا_هلاليا
738 2018-08-08 22:29:14 Boys of Summer is a fantastic song that isn't dated at all, and one of my faves about melancholic memory, having Mike Campbell's brilliant solo didn't hurt. Listen Like Thieves for me was when they moved from New Wave to a grungier more Australian sound more similar to Midn. Oil
739 2018-08-08 22:29:13 Big nyash don change your direction Sir. Follow with caution and wear full PPE. those ladies out there are wilding bruv
740 2018-08-08 22:28:59 Any of your products leave a bad taste .. everyone should boycott until you start using sustainable palm oil & stop playing a part in the inevitable extinction of our orangutans & tigers! You should be ashamed! #palmoilisnotcrueltyfree #habitatlossisreal
741 2018-08-08 22:28:46 Charcoal/tea tree oil/rosemary mask cuz my skin just had me fucked tf up for a sec
742 2018-08-08 22:28:32 •Extra information•

-you can use salt instead of sugar for a more rough exfoliation 

-honey and olive oil are optional but may be less affective

-make a new batch every 2-3 weeks 

-be caution of open wounds(lemons tend to sting)
743 2018-08-08 22:28:31 Collins is tip of iceberg about GOP Politicians and WH Cabinet members &others connected to them are all probably doing insider trading,n medical devices,Phama,Insurance Co,oil,gas,etc.
744 2018-08-08 22:28:23 Diet has changed gradually but significantly over the last 2yrs. Way less packaged foods. Used to be a sauce fiend but have avoided/eliminated soylecithin/"gums"/carrageenan/soybean oil. Sadly way less sauce in my life :( In your findings/experience is egg lecithin a bad idea?
745 2018-08-08 22:28:11 1. It’s my favorite. 
2. In Oklahoma, my backyard probably does count as a nature preserve. We have like zero oil pumps.
746 2018-08-08 22:28:03 Unfortunately it called the dirty oil too .
747 2018-08-08 22:28:00 I’m being biased because we sell these at work but some of my favorite ones are 

-Ouai: Repair Shampoo/Conditioner

-bumble & bumble: Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil Shampoo/Conditioner 

-Alterna Haircare: Caviar Anti-Aging Replenishing Moisture Shampoo/Conditioner
748 2018-08-08 22:27:58 So he's going to stop Saudi Arabia oil imports when?
749 2018-08-08 22:27:48 No oil in Vegas
750 2018-08-08 22:27:45 Afternoon snack: rosemary & olive oil triscuits, freezer burrito. Many flavors, one mouth.
751 2018-08-08 22:27:27 Lithium isn’t like oil because lithium doesn’t have to be burned like oil. Also lithium can be reused and recycled unlike burnt oil
752 2018-08-08 22:27:24 All excellent!
But everyone forgets The The. 
In Oz we had Midnight Oil, Painters & Dockers, Yothu Yindi, Radio Birdman, Weddings, Parties, Anything etc.
753 2018-08-08 22:27:23 So...how else are we going to have the petroleum to run our current society? The phone you are using to be on social media with, without oil, wouldn't exist
754 2018-08-08 22:27:21 Cooked rice I to the pan. Stir it around to get the flavour of the oil.  Veggies in. Stir around. I put the veggies in frozen and then let them thaw in amongst the rice. The thawing process gives them a steamed texture. When they're satisfactory soy sauce goes in. Mix well
755 2018-08-08 22:27:21 My uncle here @kataps_geetee will do that calculation, because he said Taraba is not developing because there is no oil wells in the state. On diaries, how do you get that when the state govt trying to wipe out the ranchers (fulani) and kill thousands of cattles? 
756 2018-08-08 22:27:13 Saudi Arabia has to show muscle because they are so terrified that their own people discover that activism works and that their short dynasty of Tyrants will fall as they need to open more with the end of the oil area. Money will lead the power not kings. #mohamed_bin_salman
757 2018-08-08 22:27:09 The current state of Venezuela, 

along with his admission of socialism’s failure, 

lends itself to the possibility that Maduro might accept help from outside the country. 

Why not develop a strong relationship with the country with the largest oil reserves in the world?
758 2018-08-08 22:26:54 @RealAlexJones does not peddle in snake oil lmfao, he peddles in fish oil. So...what was your point? I think we're all a bit confused now, sugar.
759 2018-08-08 22:26:41 น่ากินอะ
760 2018-08-08 22:26:39 I’ve never met more people in my life than in Stubenville Ohio that hate the oil and gas industry
761 2018-08-08 22:26:34 [Oh, it makes him /lust/, hearing that beautiful moan. But this is about Aurelius and his pleasure right now. His hands make a slow repeated journey up and down arms and shoulders for a few minutes, really working the oil in before shifting to lightly move over Aurelius -
762 2018-08-08 22:26:30 No o, daddy. I still dey focused
763 2018-08-08 22:26:24 We send many to SA, as well as High Tech folks. And some of your best oil field workers are Canadian!

7000 of SA students were on our soil seeking education, I am confident we don’t have 7000 Can. Students in SA.
764 2018-08-08 22:26:24 That’s being generous calling him a snake oil salesman.....he is much more sinister.
765 2018-08-08 22:26:22 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub
766 2018-08-08 22:26:15 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub
767 2018-08-08 22:25:56 What say ye of the ongoing, daily GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon so British Govt and EU can steal oil and gas on videos. Support REFERENDUM and solves these problems instead of building memorials for atrocities.
768 2018-08-08 22:25:48 Bingo! It’s all about money & greed. We are shifting toward a much Greener Economy, but to do so, the same corruptive insider trading billionaires need to slowly unwind their coal & oil positions in a high note while sending climate denier soldiers out to de-value alternatives.
769 2018-08-08 22:25:37 It's great we have a large supply of oil to fall back on now that we are in a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia. All we have to do is ensure the construction of the pipelines that *squints* Trudeau canceled and sabotaged.
770 2018-08-08 22:25:36 I just had a 10 minute debate with myself on whether I should buy oil for my car or a spice rack.. Being an adult is weird.
771 2018-08-08 22:25:30 Maybe for the Trudeau government this will be the straw that breaks the camels back?  Now, more than ever we should view our Oil Sands as a strategic, national resource, and stop importing any from abroad. Build all the pipelines - immediately, an national project.
772 2018-08-08 22:25:23 Have Saudi Arabia threaten to cut oil supplies the Canada  This could be considered a favour
773 2018-08-08 22:25:15 POURS COCONUT OIL ON LIFE
774 2018-08-08 22:25:14 Deciding on simple meal staples helped me loads, too! I usually cook off dried chickpeas or lentils, then have spoonfuls throughout the day. Cooked chickpeas can just be traybaked, tossed in seasoning and olive oil. If I didn't have that, I'd never feel full and sated.
775 2018-08-08 22:25:12 MBS becoming one of my favorite leaders in the ME.
Says Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land, got the oil prices higher, and now is putting Trudeau in his place. I never would have thought a Muslim King could be friendlier than a Canadian PM towards Israel.
776 2018-08-08 22:25:00 What are they going to do!  This is what energy independence allows us... we produce more oil then they do..
777 2018-08-08 22:24:36 I'm the world's worst with exercise but I believe small steps can help improve heart health - walking more etc. Spoonful of olive oil every day too apparently. Sounds a bit nasty though but if it works, well! Smoking is so hard I used to smoke rolling tobacco until 2 years ago
778 2018-08-08 22:24:34 Your arrogance is a reminiscent of some of the ancestors in time of Jahiliyyah i.e Abu Jahl , Umayyah Ben Khalef ...
Keep on , you’re already more isolated than ever . And your oil is not for ever
779 2018-08-08 22:24:34 @ChristinaCIM lady, can you be a charitable queen and tell me what kind of oil you use to moisturize your face?
780 2018-08-08 22:24:28 That’s called winning at work.
781 2018-08-08 22:24:12 cetaphil oil control foam wash + their oil control moisturizer. works wonders
782 2018-08-08 22:24:09 @FedericaMog stop supporting Islamic regime, a regime which kills peaceful protesters on the streets, breaks the bones of girls who do not obey forced hijab, steals millions of dollars of oil business and spends it for terrorists.
783 2018-08-08 22:24:00 Well, personally I hardly need to copy-paste to be critical of the Great Snake Oil Salesman
784 2018-08-08 22:23:56 about a week ago I dropped my hair oil in my room and ever since there’s not a day where I don’t almost slip and fall to the ground cause I can’t get it out of the floor !
785 2018-08-08 22:23:52 So we don't need #kindermorgan to get our oil to Asia then huh?
786 2018-08-08 22:23:42 천원이 아니라 2만원인가 흠
787 2018-08-08 22:23:34 Prepare rice like you do. Swap in stock for water If you like. When done you can go right to frying.

Heat up a some oil in a pan, wok is best but anything non stick is good. When the oil is hot put in ginger and garlic. Let the flavour infuse the oil for a bit
788 2018-08-08 22:23:10 Girl I use a pressing wax or Tea tree oil
789 2018-08-08 22:23:06 i use a eye brow brush and use it after a shower plus aragon oil then let it sit then take some b complex
790 2018-08-08 22:23:05 No it isn’t. Rotterdam effect is IMHO bollox. Take the crude oil referred to: is that going to be routed differently just because of Brexit? No. So will the trade figures vary? No. It is still goods entering NL to be refined, or even just stored, before shipped to UK.
791 2018-08-08 22:23:05 Saudi Energy Minister Says Dispute With Canada Won't Affect Aramco Clients In Canada -Saudi Press Agency
Saudi Energy Minister Says Saudi Oil Supplies Not Subjected To Political Considerations
792 2018-08-08 22:23:00 These “oil”igarchs have been the source of most of the world’s problems for decades. Time to let them know we’re ready to move into the 21st Century.

795 2018-08-08 22:22:34 Yep—That Snake Oil Salesman conned hard working people out of their votes, healthcare & their jobs
796 2018-08-08 22:22:32 Not while it's western allies continue believing in the vastly overestimated oil reserves. Penny will drop soon enough. Maybe this is why KSA is looking east to the future
797 2018-08-08 22:22:31 My Canada high-fives anyone who stands up for equality for women, a goal we should be willing to loudly champion anywhere in the world. Oil money or equality?
798 2018-08-08 22:22:29 Since #climatechange is in the news - thank you, @weatherchannel and reality - I take issue with the “97% of scientists agree”. I have met exactly one (of 1000s of scientists interacted with) engineer who was a climate skeptic, and he worked for Gulf Oil from the 70s-90s. You?
799 2018-08-08 22:22:21 I dislike Krispy Kreme donuts but the number of fast food places I’ve seen rats and roaches in... I won’t even bother counting

I’ve walked out of a hotel kitchen during a shoot and refused to come back in cause there was rotten food and oil on the floor

But shut down KK I guess
800 2018-08-08 22:22:16 Not for money. Not for oil!
801 2018-08-08 22:22:08 After U.S.A, the Saudis' are our 2nd biggest supplier of refined oil but Canada produces more oil than we can use. We have 5% of the worlds output (5th overall). If we only had a coast to coast pipeline eh? Then we could really tell em what we think bout human rights @boomottawa
802 2018-08-08 22:21:50 Obviously, burning the state down first will make oil well access easier.
803 2018-08-08 22:21:50 My issue with newer small block turbos is the propensity for oil burning and the direct injection only setup, which can lead to PCV gases and EGR gases fouling up the intake valves. On a port injected engine, those intake valves stay clean.
804 2018-08-08 22:21:47 Yeah, like the Oil Companies who claimed that getting rid of #NoDapl Acitvists was a "win for environmental rights,"  #NewsSpeak #Orwellian
805 2018-08-08 22:21:39 Is she naive or? Enthralled in big oil and gas?
806 2018-08-08 22:21:24 The only soap I EVER use down there is Dr. Bronners Tea tree oil soap. 

I swear you don’t know clean until you use it.

809 2018-08-08 22:21:09 Iraqis, especially those in Basra, are upset because oil is being pumped from their land & their ports and borders are being used for economic transactions yet they have no infrastructure or basic services. They are also starving, with the majority relying only on bread for food.
810 2018-08-08 22:21:09 He’s poisonous to those who don’t realize they’re being poisoned. He inspires fear and rage, just so he can peddle his snake oil. The man doesn’t deserve a street corner, much less a national platform.
811 2018-08-08 22:21:00 Hey @SeloOils hurry up will you! I just spent 10 CAD on (((Portuguese))) olive oil.

814 2018-08-08 22:20:38 One ton of natural #uranium can produce more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. This is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil.
815 2018-08-08 22:20:23 The difference between Charlottes Web CBD oil, which works to control seizures, and the very expensive product, is that the pharmaceutical product is prob highly purified and very regular in potency, batch to batch, allowing Drs to prescribe this therapy more safely.
816 2018-08-08 22:20:18 Seems you need our Dr’s and Teachers. 
We have oil, so keep it. We only do $3B in trade... 

Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!
817 2018-08-08 22:20:09 Iranian regime is terrible, but You can not compare Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is centuries behind in every single aspect ( with the exception of oil exports).

832 2018-08-08 22:18:34 @DannyCrotts brings home CBD oil. Starts me on a twice a day regimen. IDK what the intent is, but since I’m ignorant of the whole process I have decided: it will cause weight loss, replace skin collagen, balance my hormones, grow my bank account, and do my lesson plans. #yayCBD
833 2018-08-08 22:18:12 There is giant barrel of oil, we will d** y** shortly.

835 2018-08-08 22:18:04 Time to get serious and build factories that build our own fighters refineries that produce our own gas and upgrade Alberta oil .You want jobs and growth theres the solution get at it not tomorrow today .Sweden builds its own planes it can be done and should be done .
836 2018-08-08 22:17:42 Why not, under the current administration the US has sold off its strategic oil reserves, so all we need now is more Saudi control and high prices to create inflation-all thanks to the Republicans
837 2018-08-08 22:17:33 On the west coast nothing will change, the eastern half of Canada on the other hand... maybe people will realize just how important oil is... when they start paying the prices we do in Vancouver!

844 2018-08-08 22:16:46 Like I stated in another tweet, he needs to get money from somewhere. While the western world is just complaining about @Tesla and @elonmusk, fucking Saudi Arabia is actually investing in them.

At least he'll put that dirty blood oil money to some good use.

862 2018-08-08 22:13:53 I suspect that was their goal. Autism Speaks advocate snake oil cures and declare autism an “unmitigated disaster” for families. Oh and they’re misogynists too.

870 2018-08-08 22:13:32 The terrible truth is that I just bought the pepper grinder (that we still use today). I was living on linguine with garlic, red chilli, olive oil and parmiggiano. You can make that with a grater, at a pinch.
871 2018-08-08 22:13:23 Just a charismatic magafauna, living in a sphere of anarchy and sounding like a big fan blade badly needing oil.

873 2018-08-08 22:13:11 I think we should do the same and get the hell out of the Middle East. And yes @ElizabethMay start using our own oil until you come up with a better solution. #greens
874 2018-08-08 22:13:10 Don't allow the Killing Kingdom,Saudi Arabia to get away with what they did. The sword wielding lunatics think oil is all to life.
875 2018-08-08 22:13:07 If we had a pipeline to east we wouldn’t need Saudi. Who really has dirty oil. But why is our government attacking injustice in SA. All Middle East countries but Israel  have autocratic non democratic govt.
876 2018-08-08 22:12:47 I'm not vegan but I've been eating beans (white or black), rice (black or brown) and steamed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms) with miso, mirin, and chili oil. I frequently have that for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

893 2018-08-08 22:10:59 Perhaps Trudeau should reconsider his governments position on pipelines. Today, Alberta oil is selling at about HALF the price that Texas oil is selling for, because our politicians, and environ'mental'ists demand that we strangle the western, natural resource based economy.

901 2018-08-08 22:10:29 He's a terrible analyst, routinely gets things wrong, and for me personally he's far too homerish. Which is something I know a lot of fans like(especially in Oil Country) but it's not what I want out of an analyst. He's a bit of a shitbag of a person, too.

911 2018-08-08 22:09:45 A perfect summer supper this evening: spaghetti with fresh pesto sauce, fried slices of breaded eggplant, & a salad of tomatoes, sweet onion, red bell pepper, the kernels cut from an ear of corn along with their milk, chopped parsley, garlic, a splash of wine vinegar, olive oil.
912 2018-08-08 22:09:34 For skin colour it is also really different from the greenish military usage. Makes me wonder if there are roots in pejorative use such as olive (oil) eater.
913 2018-08-08 22:09:27 @JustinTrudeau @RalphGoodale That Enegy East Pipeline project would sure look great right now wouldn’t it!  Imagine, Canadian oil being moved across the country for Canadians to use, instead of that terrible stuff from Saudi.
914 2018-08-08 22:09:14 And with that point, why give the money to an organisation which doesn’t fund any real action and rewards mining and oil executives with all-expenses holidays to the reef? How does that help?
915 2018-08-08 22:09:11 Oil
916 2018-08-08 22:09:05 Fuck that guy. Locking up kids, grabbing pussy, treasoning. Fuck him. He's a charlatan, snake oil salesmen of the absolute worst kind. He's a "lock up your shit, Trumps coming over" kinda guy. Fuck Trump.

924 2018-08-08 22:08:17 I use this same mixture except I add tea tree oil. I do this every 4wks because my scalp is super dry and I get dandruff sometimes.
925 2018-08-08 22:08:16 Fuel lines to gasoline and oil engines frequently pass over the exhaust pipe.
926 2018-08-08 22:08:15 The Eco-System was already fragile after another (the worst ever) Environmental travesty in the Gulf. BP... oil and gas both.
927 2018-08-08 22:08:14 In bible school, I never understood why it was such a big deal to have your head anointed with oil but now I understand that they were doing hair masks which let’s be fair make all of us feel extremely chosen
928 2018-08-08 22:08:08 I just can’t with this heat anymore. Someone please wake me up when the coconut oil is solid.
929 2018-08-08 22:08:04 If you are paying to have the car's oil changed, you own too nice of an automobile.

932 2018-08-08 22:07:52 Nationalized industries became a disaster, so when oil prices fell the ability to rebuild Venezuelan industries and increase production in other areas was completely null.  Eg: Venezuela’s steel production: after it was nationalized in 2008, steel production fell more than 70%.

944 2018-08-08 22:06:21 A real leader would take steps to ensure we become energy independent and stop importing foreign oil.

946 2018-08-08 22:06:04 We are counting on a future plan. in 2030 we will not need oil
947 2018-08-08 22:06:01 It's official!

I am now an Affiliate with the @BuyLegaIMeds ! Glad to be a part of such an amazing product(s)!

If anyone needs some further education on the many MANY benefits of CBD oil and products therein, I'm here for you!

Huge shout-out to @JoeVargas !
948 2018-08-08 22:05:58 It's so wonderful, this fracking thing.  Everybody knows that oil has a price limit, and that oil is available for import from the USA.  No more "Isha'Allah, do our bidding and hate Israel or no oil for you."  That card can't be played too effectively anymore!
949 2018-08-08 22:05:56 Omfg CBD oil tastes vile. Let’s hope it bloody does the trick 
950 2018-08-08 22:05:55 Have you tried moisturizing with an oil at night? Sometimes our skin gets oily because it actually needs oil so it over-produces it... trust me i feel your pain
951 2018-08-08 22:05:54 And quality chocolate too! None of your palm oil riddled muck!
952 2018-08-08 22:05:52 So when are you going to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and buying oil from Canada
953 2018-08-08 22:05:49 It has less to do with the oil, and more to do with the fact there have been occasional glimmers of hope with the Saudis. In other words, small steps could ultimately lead to big steps.
954 2018-08-08 22:05:42 •what to do•

- squeeze half of a fresh lemon into a bowl 

- add one tbsp of olive oil into the bowl with the lemon 

- add one tbsp of honey into the mixture
955 2018-08-08 22:05:31 always comes back to oil
956 2018-08-08 22:05:09 It’ll grow back before you know it. Try castor oil on the scalp.
957 2018-08-08 22:05:05 Me a read say a true dem jail these 2 women bloggers and Canada a pree dem freedom and sumn bout human rights.

We too nuff if a did oil me woulda understand
958 2018-08-08 22:05:03 みなとみらい行きたい！ヨコハマ！ディビジョン！！！でもそんな元気なのかっていう
959 2018-08-08 22:04:46 Yeah tell me again how those mean old democrats are keeping him from doing the right thing.  That’s the best laugh I’ve had all day.  Plenty of people would vote for it if he was doing the right thing.  He’s a snake oil salesman that promised things he never planned to do.
960 2018-08-08 22:04:44 がんばります！
961 2018-08-08 22:04:40 Lavender and stress away diffused are amazing for relaxation! Both of my kids love lavender, it calms them down! I made a roller with peppermint EO, diluted with coconut oil for my son's headaches and also use it for mosquito bites!!!! 
962 2018-08-08 22:04:36 Zonder Standard Oil, (mogelijk) geen Barbarossa. Maar dat is allemaal zo lang geleden. Next!
963 2018-08-08 22:04:25 I think we also need to follow the funding of these organizations and I bet much of it comes from George soros tide foundation and other foreign entities that have a vested interest in stopping the flow of Canadian oil
964 2018-08-08 22:04:24 I remember following the Saudi stuff last year, when the Prince arrested everyone and took over, Jared's secret trip to visit the Prince, Trump siding with them over Qatar, the stock market thing, and the Saudis buying the largest oil refinery in Texas! It was all very suspect!
965 2018-08-08 22:04:23 where can I find a big bottle of tea tree oil
966 2018-08-08 22:04:19 Oil City, sound sleep.
967 2018-08-08 22:04:18 I left my oil pen in an Uber 
968 2018-08-08 22:04:05 Seems a bit disingenuous, "the family yacht" is a bit of word salad to say "It doesn't actually belong to her so she has nothing to do with where it's registered but we hate her so BLARGH!!"
969 2018-08-08 22:04:04 Canada don't need oil gas from Saudi Arabia my prime minister of Canada like how Washington need from them
970 2018-08-08 22:03:56 I suck at cooking lmaooo and I realized i used an expired coconut oil to cook the burgers
971 2018-08-08 22:03:43 I know a guy thay demanded oil be checked everyday.  One day worker went to him and asked where tractor key was.  

He got the sack.

Key was on the dipstick.
972 2018-08-08 22:03:43 well we should poll every thing out of Saudi. send back there people. We do not need there oil we do have are's
973 2018-08-08 22:03:28 Abokin maikudi mana
974 2018-08-08 22:03:24 Will be taking care of mine tonight. Chill it itches & this oil horrible 
975 2018-08-08 22:03:22 The whole world loves Canada and laughs at Saudi Arabia. If you didn't have oil nobody would even bother with you savages. You make excuses for old men to have sex with children. Nobody respects your country, we tolerate it
976 2018-08-08 22:03:17 Only red hot pepper and you need spices, garlic and olive oil
977 2018-08-08 22:03:12 lol nooo I was entering  into your generous giveaway for a Lip scrub or ingrown hair oil! Surprise me!
978 2018-08-08 22:03:07 I thought it was crumb cake… As a Cauil lover myself it needs a little salt or pepper… lets pretend it had a little S & P on it or maybe some olive oil…
979 2018-08-08 22:03:06 Iran’s coverage: US will not stop Iran oil exports: Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif
980 2018-08-08 22:03:05 interesting!! I’ll have to go through my products and see if I use coconut oil at all. I have very thick and colored hair and recently have noticed I’m losing color fast and my hair has been getting thinner  I need to find better quality products tbh
981 2018-08-08 22:03:04 cuma beli push up drama sama garnier micellar oil
982 2018-08-08 22:03:04 あんステフェス終わったあとご飯行こうね～～？？暇人だから探しとくわ 中華街らへんで
983 2018-08-08 22:02:58 Idk how y'all are buying carts and making them last a whole ass week. I smoked a gram in a day or two. Might as well buy shatter and load my own oil in a pen.
984 2018-08-08 22:02:51 Amateur snake oil sales pitch.
985 2018-08-08 22:02:41 No not yet until #Britain hands off totally from #Biafra oil & gas then you will know real meaning #WORD #impoverish
986 2018-08-08 22:02:36 Waiting to hear back from @barleypoptap about my reserve corner bar seat. Looking forward to #GTMW to try the great variants of Term Oil.
987 2018-08-08 22:02:30 I scrub with salt and oil, Victorian days style, rinse and wipe dry.
988 2018-08-08 22:02:13 Backronym: canola = "CANadian Oil, Low Acid."
989 2018-08-08 22:02:10 治安悪いの～～？？ヒエ～～～～さすがヨコハマ・ディビジョン
990 2018-08-08 22:02:08 I think we do about 1.5b with them. We don't need or want their oil but Mr.Baird thinks we should bow down and agree with their treatment of people with a different view.Tell Mr.Baird to go there and see what happens
991 2018-08-08 22:01:46 Why is Saudi oil so much more valuable than Iranian or Venezuelan oil?
992 2018-08-08 22:01:45 Step 2: No more Saudi oil imports. We can supply our own oil, thanks.
993 2018-08-08 22:01:42 Coconut oil or hot oil treatments or olive oil
994 2018-08-08 22:01:41 even better coconut oil and some elastic bands. 
995 2018-08-08 22:01:30 So my brand spanking new 2018 @Ford F150 goes in for its 2nd scheduled maintenance and 1st oil change.  The next day the oil is LEAKING all over the place. How in hell is my oil pan LEAKING on a brand new truck?
996 2018-08-08 22:01:18 If I break your heart, Na oil spillage
997 2018-08-08 22:01:17 F**k #SaudiArabia if it wasn't for Donald Trump Saudi Arabia wouldn't be acting so bold. When the U.S along with the rest of the world stops buying they're oil it will just be another broke 3rd world country.
998 2018-08-08 22:01:15 I need a big ass oil painting of myself dressed like Gangrel at the entrance of my crib.
999 2018-08-08 22:01:10 my new therapist’s office is playing sufjan and has peppermint essential oil diffusers, this is very Millennial
1000 2018-08-08 22:01:10 Nephew: “How do you say oil in French?”
1001 2018-08-08 22:01:08 I’m sure it was. But U can’t blame it’s woes on socialism. Venezuela suffers from falling oil prices. It would be horrible if we became more like Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, & Iceland! Have U seen how bad their economies R? How unhappy their citizens R? The crime they have!
1002 2018-08-08 22:01:07 Or....they need to suck up for oil....and we don't
1003 2018-08-08 22:01:02 In January I did! I needed a fresh start, but it’s halfway back to full again thanks to this fye ass beard oil I’ve been using!
1004 2018-08-08 22:01:02 It depends on the oil you choose to use. The tech will inspect your vehicle and take the mileage into consideration and recommend the best oil for your car. -SMT
1005 2018-08-08 22:00:57 My birthday has consisted of work and an oil change so far.. talk about exciting
1006 2018-08-08 22:00:56 Nations such as Canada and the US produce 99999999999999% more oil than they import from SA, it's honestly such an unnecessary trade, can't wait for the day where oil means less and less so dictatorships like KSA can settle down and calm their tits.
1007 2018-08-08 22:00:50 No oil money at the Emirates
1008 2018-08-08 22:00:43 If anyone knows a snake oil salesman it’s the bottom feeder who represents a porn star.
1009 2018-08-08 22:00:42 I'll respond , just in case u didn't actually mute me.  Not a single oil think tank was utilized in any responses.  The references utilized include but are not limited to physics lectures, Geology and Meteorology textbooks, observation, military safety documents, & common sense.
1010 2018-08-08 22:00:41 Très grosse baisse du charbon au Danemark en tout cas. Le cas de l’Angleterre devrait aussi être intéressant à regarder.
1011 2018-08-08 22:00:34 my engine life is at 10% but my oil change appt is on Friday 
1012 2018-08-08 22:00:33 Does this CBD oil stuff really work? Thinking about trying some, any spots in Glendale ?
1013 2018-08-08 22:00:33 Cheese too melted, gonna fall off the slice when he picks it up. Maybe tone it back 1 notch on the oil, and pepperoni isn’t evenly distributed

1016 2018-08-08 22:00:27 از خدا که نباید ترسید...
1017 2018-08-08 22:00:12 Me either Lisa,  he's a snake oil salesman as my grandmother would say.
1018 2018-08-08 22:00:10 Yup. Dig it out of the ground and hide it in another hole.
That’s the function of gold. Consuming oil and making the saudis rich.
1019 2018-08-08 22:00:08 Hennessy and Break Oil
1020 2018-08-08 22:00:05 We use young living essential oils tummygize oil! We put a roller top and on and roll clockwise around the belly button to help things get going!
1021 2018-08-08 22:00:00 Had oil falling in 2 stages, just ahead of t broader mrks, & just after gold. First bottom 2016, second in 2020. Mrks fell 2007/2008, as oil. Oil fell after gold 2011, mrks did some but held & climed. Neg div owed. Oil fell hard f 2014 through 2015-16. Mrks fell a little 2016.
1022 2018-08-08 22:00:00 I just can’t ... I drop off my car at the shop and sit in the waiting room. Tech comes in and screams “who has the Jetta?” I say I do. He says, “How do you start the thing?” I swear to Bob...this place.....it’s only because the oil changes are free #Bellyeah:/
1023 2018-08-08 21:59:38 Saudi Arabia's running out of oil anyway. If they want to internationally isolate themselves, just carry on doing what you're doing.. #Newsnight
1024 2018-08-08 21:59:25 Just used coconut oil to untangle my hair before washing it never been so happy in my LIFE!
1025 2018-08-08 21:59:15 I voted Liberal in the FED. But it was a throw away vote as Berta is Tory blue. I hope the energy east pipeline gets built. I'm also an ex oil well driller so I'm pro oil.
1026 2018-08-08 21:59:00 Yes definitely change your oil! That’s how I lost one of the Loves of my life! (4 tires & a steering wheel)!
1027 2018-08-08 21:58:54 Follow the money. The importance to set the lowest price for oil for the US at EVERY cost (read: war, corruption, fraude) is evident. It’s needed to make the rich more richer. It can never be stopped and that’s very unsettling.
1028 2018-08-08 21:58:51 You can change my oil if you bring a pet trash panda
1029 2018-08-08 21:58:44 #WorkforceDevelopment my husband was to retire this yr but coming homing from SPAIN his OIL tanker was HIJACKED by the Nigerian PORT AUTHORITY commander Peter Roger 4 28 17, they where held on a ship made into a jail they all beaten starved and tortured please
1030 2018-08-08 21:58:41 it’s digital art, which is quicker than traditional (oil) painting
1031 2018-08-08 21:58:26 Did you have a favourite "moment"? There was this hazelnut oil that I was wild about, and the citrus vinaigrette, the petit fours come to mind first. But they change the menu regularly.
1032 2018-08-08 21:58:20 oil it’s always about oil and Canada is another top producer of oil
1033 2018-08-08 21:57:51 No, it's the best solution...but it's the only scenario in play right now. Agreed re. oil, and I've made a similar point on several radio shows this week.
1034 2018-08-08 21:57:48 Notice it is next to the gallon of Wesson Oil. I see a deep frying incident in the future. 
1035 2018-08-08 21:57:42 I trade oil and unleaded. As to equities I would look for tight correlations to oil over the last 90 days. And those that actually sell oil.
1036 2018-08-08 21:57:30 It’s literally wayyyyy easier. More like put all his in the pot come back in 25 min. I think you can pick most to least effort too. The meals are pretty good. All you need at home is salt, pepper and olive oil. Trust me it’s your speed 
1037 2018-08-08 21:57:20 I've heard garlic or fish oil pills work
1038 2018-08-08 21:57:04 Producing too much Shale oil؟
1039 2018-08-08 21:56:59 bro i can afford i’m an oil king, i need games like for now
1040 2018-08-08 21:56:53 My dad and my boyfriends relationship  now is mostly my dad texting Casey to remind him to check my oil. I want to be a feminist and tell them I can check my own oil. But it’s just so cute. My two guys always lookin out.
1041 2018-08-08 21:56:48 You make me feel it... [He smiles softly, leaning down to kiss Aurelius softly as he poured some oil into his hands.]
1042 2018-08-08 21:56:38 Oh Edwin  
Rub some baby oil on your tan lines and stand in the sun for about 20 mins...
1043 2018-08-08 21:56:29 Highlight of my day. Spilling 2 quarts of oil all over myself and having to go home, shower, and change. At least my manager’s not here this week to have an aneurism about me wearing jeans now #PerksOfTheAutoIndustry
1044 2018-08-08 21:56:20 Spray peppermint oil all in the attic they can't breathing and will move on !!
1045 2018-08-08 21:56:16 I fucking hate this town and all the self entitled pricks who think having a oil job makes them better than everyone else. Nobody gives a fuck dude.
1046 2018-08-08 21:56:16 Lavender oil!
1047 2018-08-08 21:56:05 Been using my new @Indie_Lee products + in love with her toner + JADE rolling after her facial oil. Quick results is an understatement 
1048 2018-08-08 21:55:34 Wonder where the US will be invading next looking for oil.  Pretty self evident, and the when will be around $100 for crude.
1049 2018-08-08 21:55:22 As Saudi Arabia hurries to sever ties with Canada (over some fair criticism), is there an opportunity here? Until we’re no longer reliant on oil, perhaps we should rely on our own sources. #cdnpoli
1050 2018-08-08 21:55:20 Sooo I go get my oil changed welll I left my bowl in the car in the console I’m waiting for my car I open my middle console to smoke them bitches took my weed out my bowl !

1053 2018-08-08 21:54:54 Do you trust an olive oil when it is certified by the North American Olive Oil Association?
1054 2018-08-08 21:54:46 Dawn dish soap must have the best marketing campaign of all time. Anytime I think about ducks, oil, or soap, my brain screams "DAWN DISH SOAP GETS THE OIL OF THE BABY DUCKS IN THE OIL SPILL." I hate you @DawnDish, but good job on saving the ducks
1055 2018-08-08 21:54:46 It may play a peripheral role, but the root cause of what happened last weekend in Jijiga isn't oil. I'm trying to finish a lengthy article dedicated solely to explaining what the f caused that mess.
1056 2018-08-08 21:54:44 There final smash is drenching the field in oil and a platoon comes out and plants an american flag that let's out a shockwave while the national anthem plays.
1057 2018-08-08 21:54:31 You make me laugh and loath. Israel is one of the biggest instigators of the war in Syria. And the World starts to realise that USA is backing them up so the oil in the Golan can be pumped up by Genie energy which has many people of the Trump admin in its board of directors.
1058 2018-08-08 21:54:23 Canada still sells weapons to Saudi and builds oil pipelines 
1059 2018-08-08 21:54:20 いいじゃなーい(*´꒳`*)武勇伝
1060 2018-08-08 21:53:58 You should be scared, he's leading

All of Latin America is falling away from threats of Arab Oil States.  That's because the USA is exporting oil again.  And our neighbors get good deals.
1061 2018-08-08 21:53:47 shout-out to Abby's mom for getting me chocolate and an essential oil bracelet during one of the most stressful weeks I've had in a while. love you, kel kel
1062 2018-08-08 21:53:32 Desert hillbillies finally figured out they're in the energy business not the oil business.

1064 2018-08-08 21:53:17 Cool. Now tell the public how much oil and gas investment has left the province!
1065 2018-08-08 21:52:51 Agree. Don't cut off your nose to spite  your face, so to speak.  What would happen if Saudi Arabia decided to cut off oil to us?  We would be screwed and for what?  A big mouth MP who should have dealt with this diplomatically.
1066 2018-08-08 21:52:27 - never leave your razor in the shower!! it can cause bacterial infections!
- always moisturize after showering
- shave the way your hair grows
- exfoliate before and after you shave to get rid of dead skin
- shave using coconut oil!!
1067 2018-08-08 21:52:22 Nice. How did you strip the oil pan lol?
1068 2018-08-08 21:52:20 Today, I tried half olive oil and half butter, a way better experience 
1069 2018-08-08 21:52:12 This tweet is a brief description of Gimba kakanda. I hate twitter for verifying that account.
1070 2018-08-08 21:52:10 The Federal Reserve's Plunge Protection Team & US Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund have become the HFT "Price Controls Goon Squad". Quick history lesson price controls always break & lead to chaotic increases. Repeal of Uptick Rule & HFT destroy farmers, oil producers, miners
1071 2018-08-08 21:52:00 hmm I wonder why all the ethical oil people are silent about Canada standing up to saudi arabia?? #cdnpoli
1072 2018-08-08 21:51:56 Check the gas and fill it up with oil
1073 2018-08-08 21:51:54 Maybe that was too much monoi oil before bed
1074 2018-08-08 21:51:53 There's oil in them there hills Jack. Any one who trades with Iran, especially in "Euros", won't trade with the Orange Peril. With us or against us, same old same old.
1075 2018-08-08 21:51:52 Women must cook to live!  Show love with a gift of Cooking gas stove to any women who has been subjected to unclean cooking today!
1076 2018-08-08 21:51:34 Yes Mike a Snake but the Oil is becoming a Burden on common folks' Pocketbook!
All about the Mentioned  Man and his plan to destroy the life of any Common Man!
A Snake followed by those who have Eaten the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge!!
1077 2018-08-08 21:51:33 Awesome! How much do you guys charge for a high mileage oil change?
1078 2018-08-08 21:51:31 We get oil but dem say na only God wey go give us light. #Japa
1079 2018-08-08 21:51:22 A Little Models
Dieter Roth, Ed Bereal
Soft ground etching and leather valise containing oil on paper
1080 2018-08-08 21:51:16 Was already boycotting. How can I boycott twice?
1081 2018-08-08 21:51:04 The oil & gas industry in Canada has some of the strongest health & safety standards in the country.
1082 2018-08-08 21:51:02 :) He's afraid of a lot more coming-out that collusion. 
For starters- The 3.6 Billion that was on the tablet 2pull out of the #IranTreaty
Despite the fact that it will cost #US, #EU & Others 100's of billions in trade losses & cause global oil to soon spike to $90/barrel
1083 2018-08-08 21:51:00 The most seductive thing I’ve ever requested- ‘I need you to pour olive oil in my ear. Don’t get it in my hair’
1084 2018-08-08 21:50:54 From the ingredients that were used to make the anointing oil in the old testament.
1085 2018-08-08 21:50:53 And in a few weeks the worries will be about shortages of oil. The bouncing ball and other moving targets are the reality of oil.
1086 2018-08-08 21:50:53 A reminder, whenever @LiamFox - or any of his snake-oil-peddling Brexit ilk - trumpet a trade deal as evidence of the UK going it alone: All those deals are being done by and as the EU. Not only are they not UK deals now, for the UK they become void the moment we leave the EU.
1087 2018-08-08 21:50:52 when people talk about using coconut oil as a moisturizer, I immediately tune out or scroll on
1088 2018-08-08 21:50:47 This much is true. Similarly, anyone who has to live near an oil refinery is entitled to a view about what it should do. 
However, once you start designing it, please only listen to the engineers who know what grade of steel to use, not well meaning idiots who'd use Lego bricks.
1089 2018-08-08 21:50:39 @DarkTunnock   Tunnocks use palm oil so definitely on my black list at the moment until they amend their recipe....
1090 2018-08-08 21:50:38 Yes it's so sad to see liberals now following traditional Consv path of Abandoning global warming counter great green actions progresses by falling victim to same oil billionaires greedy needs & their standard mighty pushes& controls using their mega pocket changes
1091 2018-08-08 21:50:35 palit lage tung essential oil
1092 2018-08-08 21:50:34 The only time social media appreciates Darkskin women is when they’re drenched in oil.
1093 2018-08-08 21:50:32 Sometimes u will even look at ur shirt if it as stain with oil
1094 2018-08-08 21:50:19 I say again, there is not a country in the world with the multiple revenue streams Scotland has. Also, Norway, similar in every respect has an Oil Fund of over £2Trillion - What happened to Scotland's Oil Fund?
1095 2018-08-08 21:50:17 WHAT IF WE MADE ALL THE TREES OUT OF PLASTIC AND THEN WE COULD STORE THE OIL INSIDE THEM THAT WOULD STOP THE FIRES
1096 2018-08-08 21:50:15 Business is frequently wanting to prioritize features... like a car, you have to change the oil so often (i.e. risks, debts) --> visualize the work type distribution (e.g. categorization vs stage of workflow) @dominicad #DevOps #metrics #Agile2018
1097 2018-08-08 21:50:13 No chill in the oil corrupt desert! ;)
1098 2018-08-08 21:50:12 Any oil pens?
1099 2018-08-08 21:50:09 Saw my very first Tesla in person today!  You’re doing well if they are making into Alberta, oil capital of North America!  Good job
1100 2018-08-08 21:50:07 Hello. I am the worlds worst at deciding how much shampoo, conditioner, lotion, face wash, or beard oil to use. It's generally a portion called "equivalent to the great Boston molasses flood disaster of 1919".
1101 2018-08-08 21:50:04 I was using vitamin e oil and taking collagen when I took a break from mine. I was scared of that too.
1102 2018-08-08 21:49:53 "Snake Oil" said the snake
1103 2018-08-08 21:49:44 Butter... margarine. Never oil.
1104 2018-08-08 21:49:41 Like the 130 member states against Israel aren't either Muslim or threatened to toe the line of the Oil Rich Gulf States who threaten their oil supply.
1105 2018-08-08 21:49:25 My world has been revolutionised this week - attended an essential oils course and it has really inspired me to start blending my own fragrances at home. Currently basking my locks in rose lavender & lemon hair oil I made on the course  such a #zen feeling!
1106 2018-08-08 21:49:24 #Fletton Parkway. A1139 J4. The parkway is closed from Junc 4 to Stanground due to an oil spillage . Eastbound carriageway
1107 2018-08-08 21:49:15 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1108 2018-08-08 21:49:04 It kind of is. Stir fry is super simple. Cut up veggies, chicken or beef and put some oil (not a lot) into a wok or pan. Then cook the meat till its semi cooked (the colors are what makes it easy to determine) through veggies in and wait till they cook.
1109 2018-08-08 21:48:57 Yep the magnesium, Cramp Bark and Black Haw. The last two as tinctures and the magnesium I take with Evening Primrose oil capsules I get anywhere. The tinctures made me extremely nauseous so I learned I have to eat with those and they helped with pms constipation
1110 2018-08-08 21:48:56 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
1111 2018-08-08 21:48:53 I support the Marijuana Bill, for medical reasons since I have epilepsy. Once it becomes a law it would allow me easy access to medical marijuna or cannabis oil and free me from my chemically produced medication.
1112 2018-08-08 21:48:49 Coconut oil on my scalp??? How do we feel bout this
1113 2018-08-08 21:48:46 Try half rapeseed half olive oil ... olive oil doesn't like very hot temp ...
1114 2018-08-08 21:48:36 OIL.
I AGREE
1115 2018-08-08 21:48:27 it was a very hard decision for us they’ve become such a popular menu item that it has become a safety concern on the truck due to the water from the sprouts mixing with the oil. they’ll be back eventually we promise!
1116 2018-08-08 21:48:27 @JennaJulien Podcast Idea: Snake Oil except you guys just have a set of really out there conspiracy theories (possibly that you made up yourselves?) and you have to try to sell it to each other that they're true
1117 2018-08-08 21:48:13 Hi Orin -  the stuff that was locked in over last 45 days unlikely to see much drop off - for next tranche econs have been impacted and so worse / stay home and also China still unlikely to take much outside of spot for fear of when next tranche of tariff is inclusive of oil
1118 2018-08-08 21:48:06 Wow!!! Easy indeed, arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, everton, Tottenham would be ahead of them if they don't have oil money...the Truth is man city is richer, you think man united or chelsea could spend over 150 million on defenders?
1119 2018-08-08 21:48:03 it was a very hard decision for us they’ve become such a popular menu item that it has become a safety concern on the truck due to the water from the sprouts mixing with the oil. they’ll be back eventually we promise!
1120 2018-08-08 21:47:57 i live in the muggiest most humid apartment ever. i leave my air conditioned room for a second and my face is oil city
1121 2018-08-08 21:47:41 Palm oil is not vegan idc don’t @ me
1122 2018-08-08 21:47:37 they are about $30

for $20.00 you could get the electric oil diffuser over in the candle section, for a "lite" version, not as good but a little cheaper

plus the cool mist humidifier is also good for allergies during fall/winter without turning your room into a sauna
1123 2018-08-08 21:47:36 Many of these energy names, especially the small ones, have sold forward at much lower prices. They are not benefiting from the recent higher oil prices.
1124 2018-08-08 21:47:35 Consideration of traditional Aboriginal practices is now required of any new oil & gas projects, which is my point & reference. I’m a Parody. No bigotry implied or intended.
1125 2018-08-08 21:47:33 Seriously man? Which part of "turning a phony internet troll selling snake oil to noobs becoming a legit opposition to establishment in minds of millions of numbnuts" is hard for you to understand.
1126 2018-08-08 21:47:20 Diogenes would burn through a lot of whale oil looking for an honest man in that admin.
1127 2018-08-08 21:47:19 You understand the Lithium for electric cars batteries is a natural resource like oil. Mining for it is very destructive and harmful to the environment. It is also limited. Much of the switch to electric is not because oil is running out any time soon but for economic development
1128 2018-08-08 21:47:18 a combo of wooden spoon and olive oil works pretty well
1129 2018-08-08 21:47:17 dude every picture that’s posted of the “after” looks like they just dunked their hair in oil
1130 2018-08-08 21:47:14 Tea tree oil or spray does the trick. Takes the heat out straight away.
1131 2018-08-08 21:47:11 Try @Nigella_Lawson Chocolate olive oil cake. Works every time.
1132 2018-08-08 21:46:52 Did you go to the crucifixion today?

Your country is embarrassed by its actions and is now crying about it. The only respect you get is from having oil. Canada gets respect by actions. You are jealous that we're loved and you're hated.
1133 2018-08-08 21:46:36 Unfortunately, I don’t think there’s a snowball’s chance in hell that Inhofe’s staff will be able to sway him on the future of meeting energy demands; the ol’ dinosaur would willingly die for the oil industry.
1134 2018-08-08 21:46:31 Get you some bio oil my shit clearly up like Crazy
1135 2018-08-08 21:46:15 It's obvious they use the oil die. I'll never buy small chops from a company producing large large daily batches.
1136 2018-08-08 21:46:13 Normally my oil changes are about $90. Today it was $45. I’m happy. Bless having good friends
1137 2018-08-08 21:46:03 stop foolishness, or wind or solar, but I think this goes against their interests. I do not doubt that there are other better energies, but Trump and Saudi Arabia are not interested and meanwhile we keep burning oil or nuclear to load Tesla cars,
1138 2018-08-08 21:45:49 When @realdonaldtrump said he was going to clean up the swamp, did he mean that he would gather them all together at the WH like an oil slick, so they'd be easier to arrest? Is DT emboldening them so they'll be easier to find? Still seems awful swampy.
1139 2018-08-08 21:45:48 Why did we decide furniture polish needed to be Lemon scented? I don't buy bubblegum motor oil.
1140 2018-08-08 21:45:44 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1141 2018-08-08 21:45:33 My cousin was interviewed for a job in Saudi Arabia with an oil company, and it went really well and the interviewers liked her. But it turns out every single person who applied, except for her, got a job- all because she's the only one that wears a niqab.
1142 2018-08-08 21:45:28 I'm stewing in holy oil as we speak
1143 2018-08-08 21:45:16 You are right really,  I think when you can test by all means do... But if the scenario can't be tested by all means sling with wisdom,  you can't dig an oil well with small cash
1144 2018-08-08 21:45:12 Try dumping the oil out of your car and see how that affects performance 
1145 2018-08-08 21:45:07 did 3 face mask, popped some pimples, drowned my face in aquaphor, and did some tea tree oil spot treatments ..... still ugly
1146 2018-08-08 21:45:07 See! The oil they use!!!

Don't dare eat cold 12

The oil they use ehnnnn! Tueh!

I compared their that must have been produced in large batches to the ones my colleague does...even when it got cold. Oluwa o. 12 tasted like chaff.
1147 2018-08-08 21:45:06 Looking for coconut  oil pal.
1148 2018-08-08 21:44:58 kalo kulit kaya kaki gitu, aku sih rajin2 scrub sama pake handbody yg rajeeeennnnn. terus kalo muka, tiap malem diakhir skincare jgn lupa pake face oil atau ga sheetmask ae tiap hari yes
1149 2018-08-08 21:44:53 Won't that be special.Oil fields exploding in wildfires.Let him send Don the lesser to work out there.
1150 2018-08-08 21:44:51 #Permian-focused Diamondback Energy is expanding its footprint in the biggest U.S. #oil field by agreeing to buy Kelso & Co.-backed Ajax Resources LLC for $1.2 billion in cash and stock -- more on @TheTerminal #OOTT
1151 2018-08-08 21:44:39  he is in debt bigly, most likely involved in money laundering to secure loans from not very honest people, but he is a good snake oil salesman, makes people like you believe he has money.  Ask him to interpret a Laffer curve.  
1152 2018-08-08 21:44:38 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did
with their oil money makes me wonder if
Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

Ohhh yeah, 
YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID
1154 2018-08-08 21:44:08 I realize he is intelligent, but sometimes I think he is a snake oil salesman.
1155 2018-08-08 21:43:57 UGH I just conquered ours like a month ago. I had apple cider vinegar traps everywhere D: I also poured boiling water down the drains every couple days along with a little canola oil. Pain in the butt but it did the job
1156 2018-08-08 21:43:56 okay thank you so much. i’m going to get my tea tree oil from home tomorrow.
1157 2018-08-08 21:43:55 If you ever find it too oily, add a little cornstarch to it too! I know when I use just coconut oil my skin isn't too fond of it!
1158 2018-08-08 21:43:54 Wasn’t he supposed to be like oil sludge ?

I don’t remember 

Either way

Weirdly sexual lmfao
1159 2018-08-08 21:43:42 Thoughts about CBD oil having any beneficial effects with #narcolepsy? #MultipleSclerosis Or where I might found research about it?
1160 2018-08-08 21:43:36 When someone toxic tries to re-kindle with you and asks you to do yoga?? Lol like why would I try to mix water with oil?
1161 2018-08-08 21:43:33 The argument for why we need to suck up to the thugs in Riyadh always comes down to "they have oil". Well Iran and Venezuela also have vast oil reserves and we don't seem to have any problem criticizing their human rights abuses
1162 2018-08-08 21:43:22 Le nucléaire est assez déterminant. Il peut encore creuser l'écart par le transfert d'usage vers l'électricité si on ajoute les 37 GW qui manquent. 58 EPR environ. cf #negatep
1163 2018-08-08 21:43:11 I don't get all the EV and @elonmusk haters. Don't they realize there's 50 years of oil left in the ground? Amazingly shortsighted. @Tesla is leading the way to the future of transportation.
1164 2018-08-08 21:43:09 To say these actions were the result of a tweet sounds lame. This looks like a well orchestrated planned economic attack on Canada specific. Kinda makes you wonder Who gains by this???  Canada must fight back with the major economic weapon we have. OIL exports to Saudis
1165 2018-08-08 21:42:54 Oil and gas are the only logical buyers... divert the manpower to the industry that will hurt theirs.
1166 2018-08-08 21:42:30 Oc, tell it to oui, do, Sem!

1167 2018-08-08 21:42:27 I did that with mine - she’s a teacher and I keep getting reminders that she hasn’t taken her training classes and emailed a bunch of people and finally called the superintendents office. There’s also a safety recall on one of her cars and the other one needs an oil check.
1168 2018-08-08 21:42:21 That’s pretty incredible! Use a nice essential oil mixed into a bit of almond oil on it. Probably not eucalyptus, unless you have a cold.
1169 2018-08-08 21:42:09 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1170 2018-08-08 21:42:09 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1171 2018-08-08 21:41:58 I'm just curious what oil industry think tank you get all this from

1174 2018-08-08 21:41:46 please reply with reaction images that convey the emotions “no”, “not interested”, “unimpressed”, or “stay away from me” bc I’ve got fuckin oil companies looking for environmental engineers and Im.....
1175 2018-08-08 21:41:34 When I put body oil on after my shower, it evaporates 
1176 2018-08-08 21:41:20 you could maybe qualify for 10 over 20. When was last time you got an oil change?
1177 2018-08-08 21:41:19 He had multiple businesses go bankrupt.He conned money out of so many people desperate for a better future through Trump U which was an horrific rip off.He is a snake oil salesman who is now conning a country,& damaging Long fought 4 international ties

嬉しいですね
1179 2018-08-08 21:41:16 I detest JT and his Govt but on this one I agree. Perfect reason now to get those pipelines done once and for all. But will he?Why are we getting SA oil when we have so much ourselves? Time 2 tell SA to screw themselves and their oil.Ethical oil much better than unethical SA oil.
1180 2018-08-08 21:41:03 Bit like the oil market then....
1181 2018-08-08 21:40:55 Uniquely identify your assets with an #RFID tag to improve decision making and reduce loss in the oil and gas industry.
1182 2018-08-08 21:40:47 What a shame if some oil prince puts me from 22 to 122 subs man 
1183 2018-08-08 21:40:43 No not really I've demonstrated we have plenty of oil. The switch to electric is much like the switch from paper bags to plastic bags. Paper bags were wrongly labeled as environmentally harmful and plastic was touted as better for the environment, 35 years we know different.
1184 2018-08-08 21:40:41 Truduh’s govt does it again ok to go anti Saudi with Cdns imprisoned there but importing their dirty despotic oil while AB can supply the nation? Not a peep. Where is Notley scheer remple and their pro pipeline stance nrg east kinder Morgan gateway keystone xl? Not a peep.
1185 2018-08-08 21:40:32 リナちゃんどした？考え事か？可愛いけど無理すんなよ？(なでなで
1186 2018-08-08 21:40:23 i just smoked then got my oil changed & the guy sticks his head in my car and goes “hmmm.... smells nice” 
1187 2018-08-08 21:40:16 Exactly. Now my boys decided against college. 1 followed in dads footsteps & in oil/gas business. Not ours because he wanted 2b able to travel 2 dif places & other 1 is an engineer 4a train Co. Happy U & I can say we're proud of our children. Many can't & that's sad.

1191 2018-08-08 21:40:06 Putting tea tree oil in your shampoo bottle!!
1192 2018-08-08 21:40:05 What are you going to export? You have oil or rugs. Choice is very limited and with sanctions in place, good luck as your currency is not worth the paper it's printed on
1193 2018-08-08 21:40:04 In another words Mr Trudeau says SA f..k off we don’t give a damn about your oil nor your business
1194 2018-08-08 21:40:04 まさかここでかかるとは
1195 2018-08-08 21:39:54 everybody knows that when El Trumpo cries about #CNN being unfair, a true #Christian cries for mama #resist
1196 2018-08-08 21:39:48 i’ll look into it some more. we’re about to try and put some oil in an empty pod and see if that works lmao
1197 2018-08-08 21:39:47 It’s 10.39pm. I’ve got coconut oil in my hair and should have showered half an hour ago, a half done inbox of emails, an 8 month old sprawled across me and the third episode of twirly woos on TV making him giggle. This is just fine. Living this aunt life to the max.
1198 2018-08-08 21:39:28 朝に聴く手の中のキャンディも
いいですね
1199 2018-08-08 21:39:27 Glad I don’t have to get an oil change often I hate doing it! Every 20K thank goodness!
1200 2018-08-08 21:39:23 Yeah. That wasn’t great. Coming off the banks of CMS and there is a plume of smoke up ahead. I think they released a TSB for that oil line later.

1202 2018-08-08 21:39:20 Demonetize them, refuse to sell them ad space, snake oil peddlers arrive all the same.
1203 2018-08-08 21:39:10 Yes that makes sense for oil, corn, wheat, sugar, and other raw materials but not gold and silver there is no reason to dump $1B-$3B worth of contracts to keep the price down unless you want it low.
1204 2018-08-08 21:39:05 Hot oil treatment 1/week. Tea tree oil is the best. Try cowashing. Shampoo is harsh on hair. But if u still want to, don't wash it to often, cause it can strip natural hair oils. CONDITION, CONDITION, CONDITION! (especially if you wash with shampoo) Our hair needs it!
1205 2018-08-08 21:38:54 Has presided over the longest barren spell in the Club's history.  Serial liar and snake oil salesman.
1206 2018-08-08 21:38:48 If I break your heart na oil spillage 
1207 2018-08-08 21:38:46 No support from USA and UK because both @realDonaldTrump and @theresa_may are too cowardly to do so, more concerned with oil and their arms sales than support human rights. @JustinTrudeau and  are doing the right thing.
1208 2018-08-08 21:38:40 More reason to rely on ourselves for oil weather it comes from Saudi Arabia or not this grandstanding is childish grow the fuck up prince now is not the time to play games
1209 2018-08-08 21:38:40 So it's all about Gas or oil ?
1210 2018-08-08 21:38:35 Since the new “EPA” rules are allowing oil companies to destroy the Louisiana crayfish habitat this may be a good thing
1211 2018-08-08 21:38:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
1212 2018-08-08 21:38:24 Saudi Arabia is the biggest sponsor of terrorism and has an atrocious human rights record, so while not the best way, we absolutely should stop sucking up to them.  Hopefully the West looks to other places for oil including Canada (thus why we need the pipeline).
1213 2018-08-08 21:38:20 and please do not shill for the oil princess omfg
1214 2018-08-08 21:38:18 Chuckles...ethanol can only exist because the American taxpayer foots the bill.  There is zero necessity for it except to pay rural farmers for their crops.  It doesn’t replace “foreign oil”, and you know it.
1215 2018-08-08 21:38:08 I just found out my childhood friend works at the oil change spot I go to. I think he gave me his discount
1216 2018-08-08 21:38:06 Sadly he is correct.  We are too ashamed of our oil reserves.  We rather keep it buried than pump it.
1217 2018-08-08 21:37:52 Our car appears to have leaked all of it's oil out and has a knocking/tapping sound when running after hearing a sharp bang earlier today.

Sounds like an expensive repair I don't need right now :(.
1218 2018-08-08 21:37:47 John Young @thekoukoureport Flint, Baltimore with lead paint, and how many other communities next to chemical plants, oil refineries & coal fired power plants?
It's okay to poison waterways, the atmosphere & to destroy the land.
Welcome to Republicanville/Conservative-ville USA.
1219 2018-08-08 21:37:41 SA is building an enormous nuclear energy plant, right? They have committed to providing alternative energy to their country while selling their massive oil to other nations.
1220 2018-08-08 21:37:35 Due to Trudeau’s stupidity on pipelines and our ETHICAL oil!!!
1221 2018-08-08 21:37:32 Seems like they were camped out above a big oil pipeline. theres more than one layer to a GOPL.
1222 2018-08-08 21:37:20 Besides, it's all about money! I can't believe ppl really think he cares about them or this country. Tax scam was for his family and friends. Tariffs that of course won't hurt him, just hard working Americans. Prices soon will rise quickly. Iranian sanctions, oil prices rising!
1223 2018-08-08 21:37:12 Last time I went for an oil change they said that I needed a new (very overpriced) cabin air filter. I said I was replacing it myself (which I didn’t do) and this time they didn’t say anything about it needing replacing. Hmmm...
1224 2018-08-08 21:37:10 While I'm on the subject of referees, James Mcgraths decision to retire today is after putting huge pressure on James Owens Sunday week.;stealing. Its just typical of alot of ref's today-massive egos. 
U didnt get the final, take your oil James Mcgrath #TommyTucker #JohnHunt
1225 2018-08-08 21:36:53 my dad made fish and chips so now the whole house smells like oil 
1226 2018-08-08 21:36:48 You don’t know what Trudeau is and does to Canada.  He is a Globalist traitor that would rather give our tax $$ to terrorists, and other countries than to help our veterans and seniors. He buys Saudi oil while our oilfield workers are unemployed.
1227 2018-08-08 21:36:37 oil based paint is a piece of shit
1228 2018-08-08 21:36:27 The SA regime are thugs. Don't owe them an apology. However, CA shouldn't have been conducting foreign diplomacy via Twitter. A lot of people wanting CA to stick to its guns now are same ones who had no issue importing SA's oil while protesting Alberta's say maybe....2 weeks ago.
1229 2018-08-08 21:36:20 Why does Mexico even get foreign aid?  They’re a pretty wealthy country with the oil, etc. which makes me go hmmm why do the illegals come here.  Of course, it’s for the freebies
1230 2018-08-08 21:36:19 The dough is way too thick and its so oily w the vegetables arent cut out 3adl w when you eat it you feel the oil in your mouth a555

1232 2018-08-08 21:36:13 An effervescing facial mask, neon black, with maple ash, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating sparkles. It's sold as a block wrapped in paper.
1233 2018-08-08 21:36:08 No, I wish! I'm sure it's easy but I haven't attempted yet. Am told it's just whipped oil and garlic, but it has to be the right consistency or it will separate.
1234 2018-08-08 21:36:06 I use tea tree oil for everything
1235 2018-08-08 21:36:00 If the CEO of a company that dumped a ton of oil on the Irish coast visited Ireland and met our Taoiseach, you'd expect our @campaignforleo to ask questions or? Just sayin' #standfortruth
1236 2018-08-08 21:35:56 I jus got that tire fixed when I got my oil changed tho 
1237 2018-08-08 21:35:38 Warmed vitamin E oil, or argan oil
1238 2018-08-08 21:35:37 Capitalism has failed.
Increase taxes, free dental for everyone! 
Nationalize our oil, refine and sell it within Canada, stop importing from Saudis. 

Canada First.
1239 2018-08-08 21:35:34 if they didn't have oil.....
1240 2018-08-08 21:35:34 But arent you pro oil industry expansion? Arent yiu also saying we need to become energy independant?

The pipeline purchase is a conservative plan that you're pissed off you couldn't do
1241 2018-08-08 21:35:32 T-Boone Pickens already tired this in West Texas 15 years ago.  He wanted to sell water like oil.
Public Utility Commisions shut him down.
1242 2018-08-08 21:35:29 Soooo I found this empty rso container and I was trying to scrape it out and I was getting nothing so I put coconut oil in it and let it sit all day and would mix it around every couple hours. Well I put it on a sandwich just a little bit ago and I already feel stoned. lol oh no
1243 2018-08-08 21:35:23 Qaddafi was not killed for humanitarian purposes but for the oil and for money. His ideas of an African gold-backed currency were his major undoing.
1244 2018-08-08 21:35:09 I’ve been trying to list the differences between Saudi Arabia and ISIS. All I’ve got so far are huge oil reserves and large defence budgets; any more suggestions?
1245 2018-08-08 21:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this August? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
1246 2018-08-08 21:34:59 It sure is great that the Marine Corps is using a cool neat video game to pump up their enrollment numbers so they can murder more innocent people over oil. Love this great nation, land of the free.

You kids better be saving your pennies because the fall will be epic.
1250 2018-08-08 21:34:39 To be honest.  Just yesterday as we talked internally how cat bonds be used to hedge against oil spill liabilities just like PG&E secures first wildfire indemnity corporate cat bond at $200m.
1251 2018-08-08 21:34:38 Just get some CBD oil or something
1252 2018-08-08 21:34:38 Got a lot of my room set up for the new year today. Excited to try out some new labs. Particularly an essential oil steam distillation with orange peels, cinnamon sticks, and spearmint leaves. It’ll be nice challenge for the kids and it’ll make the whole hallway smell good.

1262 2018-08-08 21:34:04 The Saudi's did this to Sweden a couple of years ago.  It's what they do. Hey, if they don't like that we don't approve of their human rights record -- we have our own oil.  Now, If we only had a pipeline

1268 2018-08-08 21:32:57 Aigh well whatcha needa do is put on some sunscreen before you burn like a lobster and apply some tanning oil.. tan your front for 30 minutes and then flip, tan for another 30 minutes.. then do everything all over again til you’re sick of the sun
1269 2018-08-08 21:32:56 Should have been done decades ago.  They should construct one, putting 1000's to work and ending dependence on oil from despot nations.  Instead, we have a Globalist stooge who knows nothing about building our great nation.
1270 2018-08-08 21:32:51 Mayo is an ingredient in an aoili. Eating mayo is like drinking virgin olive oil only fatter and grosser.
1271 2018-08-08 21:32:47 You cannot be this naive. Oil and gas fiduciaries are not interested in anything other than maximizing their current holdings, and they’ll be damned if anything stops them from bringing that stuff out of the ground. Also, see: Citizens United.
1272 2018-08-08 21:32:47 Good who needs them. perhaps this might be the reason to open up AB oil pipelines to the East!

1277 2018-08-08 21:32:29 @CashErrthing On a side note, I noticed Saudis are pumping less, it seems they are running out of storage according to JODI?
1278 2018-08-08 21:32:27 This is true....he is a snake oil salesman, as are all the Republicans, they convenience the general public by using the words, "tax cut" that they are all about the working class and will what is best for them while giving "tax cuts" to themselves only!
1279 2018-08-08 21:32:25  Yo your human rights record is shit.

 Oh yeah??? How bout we intentionally deny medical treatments as a diplomatic bargaining tool and tweet a 911 meme at you.

 It's ok baby, just keep that oil flowing and you can bomb Yemen to your hearts content OwO
1280 2018-08-08 21:32:15 Screw that. We have our own oil. Alberta and Saskatchewan can cover for the 8% of lost Saudi oil import.

Cons are, all of a sudden, fans of Saudi Arabia.
1281 2018-08-08 21:32:09 P-Square went into Oil and Gas, 2Baba is into Real Estate, Duncan Mighty is into Construction. Wizkid launched a clothing line recently.

1282 2018-08-08 21:32:05 We have oil, and only import less than 10% of what we use, from you. Easily replaced.  We are a resource rich country.

1290 2018-08-08 21:31:00 I don't think it's really an advantage/disadvantage dynamic (trade isn't really about "winning," in most cases), more that Saudi Arabia happens to get tanks and tank stuff from us, and we get oil and gas from them. Also worth noting: we import from SA way more than we export
1291 2018-08-08 21:30:59 The whole system is flawed is the most intelligent thing you have said. And, it will remain flawed because powerful wealthy people who control oil & coal want fossil fuels to remain the backbone of energy. They even have a propaganda machine that denies global warming, & it works
1292 2018-08-08 21:30:50 If you look closely you’ll most often than not catch oil & t markets twitching after gold’s moves on a daily, minutely, & secondsley manner. If gold is to reflect t fall of 80-00, where time is t essence, not price, t probabilities are still in favor of a major price explotion.

Your deplorable human rights record, your tin pot dictatorship swathed in oil and fancy Italian cars is a charade.  The entire western hemisphere needs to boycott your country.
1300 2018-08-08 21:29:42 I didn't know that. Only ever had a oil in maine.
1301 2018-08-08 21:29:41 172,000 but I have regular checkups and oil changes and most Jeep engines can last around 300,000 miles
1302 2018-08-08 21:29:39 Unfortunately, foreign owned Canadian tarsands miners don't want to refine here and sell to us (Not enough profit)
So we remain dependent.

Nationalize our oil and we're golden. :)
1303 2018-08-08 21:29:33 You are very naive. Its not enforced. They will get a fine, or they will sell someone else and make some sort of effort. If FFP was being enforced fully, Man City, or PSG would already be fucked out of Europe & stripped of the league titles they bought with oil money
1304 2018-08-08 21:29:19 The final reality check is that the governments, the oil industry and the grant givers are convinced that the climate change is real and fossil fuels are to be eliminated. :)

1307 2018-08-08 21:29:10 It was a policy choice to make that gradual erosion though. The Powell memo is a famous starting gun. But I'm not sure why after a couple of decades of Jim Birching, it was ok to happen. Several confounders economically - gold standard, oil embargo.
1308 2018-08-08 21:29:09 Has anyone considered if you mess with bull you get the horns. Trump is close to SA since it established an understanding with Israel.

1329 2018-08-08 21:26:44 Looks like the Saudis have called his bluff!
So come on, Justin, put up, or shut up!
Also, we don't need Saudi oil...we have Alberta and Newfoundland oil.
1330 2018-08-08 21:26:35 "Why did you use the Saudi oil from the start then?" Good question, it's called incompetence that will soon be fixed.

1345 2018-08-08 21:24:40 Nah, you can get through every daily in under an hour. No gacha. Just oil, coins and cubes. Building a random ship takes coin and 1 or 2 cube depending on small or large ship. Oil is consumed in battle.

It's pretty low key honestly.

1354 2018-08-08 21:23:17 Till now it is believed that this happened due to leakage of oil and water mixture in hydrocracker unit of refinery.
We have to wait till detailed investigation report comes.
1355 2018-08-08 21:23:10 LOL , you realy have an imagination.
 Why did you use the Saudi oil from the start then?, and if you really think that cutting of the deal is hurting us more than it hurts you then you are a space dreamer
1356 2018-08-08 21:23:10 Still made of natural materials though, in the same way as cannabis oil is man made but still natural.
1357 2018-08-08 21:23:02 @razor3000 China took off the list oil
1358 2018-08-08 21:22:58 How is any of that relevant? Winning:

SCOTUS. Tax cuts. Best job market in history.  Roaring economy. Pulled out of Paris accord. Passed oil pipelines. Stronger immigration enforcement. Rollback of regulation. Jerusalem capital of Israel. Pulled out of TPP. Destroying ISIS. Etc.
1359 2018-08-08 21:22:57 You need an oil change lmao
1360 2018-08-08 21:22:48 Since I lost my other essential oil vape it’s time to get a new one
1361 2018-08-08 21:22:47 I’m sure the oil companies you spread fallacies for wouldn’t be happy about you educating your twitter feed.
1362 2018-08-08 21:22:45 IMO this is indicative of how oil money and education interact in OK. We're reliant on philanthropy, but have no control over where it goes. Oil execs only need so many engineers/lawyers, so they just fund Universities full of Texan students and leave primary ed/oklahomans to rot
1363 2018-08-08 21:22:44 Would love to see price of oil just tank instantly
1364 2018-08-08 21:22:42 #BorisJohnsonhijab If UK whites so worried about this then ban all face coverings in UK & stop going 2 otha countries & picking off the best.

1370 2018-08-08 21:22:27 Its a shuffling match, but we can replace with our oil.  As you said, we don't import a lot.  80,000 barrels a day.  We export 3.5 million barrels a day to the US.

I am sure we can make it work.
1371 2018-08-08 21:22:22 Is it a flaw or a feature when everything looks like an oil painting? 
1372 2018-08-08 21:22:03 CBD Hemp oil is amazing wellness product for animals with all types of skin conditions.
1373 2018-08-08 21:21:59 No one wants to see me smothered in body oil for a shoot lol
1374 2018-08-08 21:21:59 @OfficialPDPNig, @APCNigeria The media are angry, why? There is no more free money from the government. The Ex generals are murmuring, Why? There is no sign President Buhari will renew their oil blocks contract.
1375 2018-08-08 21:21:55 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1376 2018-08-08 21:21:54 Having no contingency means no unforeseen events or new policies can be considered for funding..No increase in relativity of pay rates, sorry IRD, Drivers, ACC BMA, teachers and nurses. So why did Jacinda refuse to maintain NZs ongoing steady stream of income from Oil and Gas?
1377 2018-08-08 21:21:45 National Energy Board data show the kingdom shipped an average of 102,000 barrels of oil per day to Canada last year, which was also up 17% from an average of close to 87,000 bpd in 2016.
1378 2018-08-08 21:21:43 Capitalism's innovations invented the dirty grid of oil, cars, cement, the burning coal for electricity. The free market system also suppressed solar energy. The modern solar cell was invented in 1941, and big oil did not like cheap, clean energy made of sand. So now, 2 much CO2
1379 2018-08-08 21:21:36 Why is finding 100% vitamin e oil so hard. Not trying to buy it online I need it now
1380 2018-08-08 21:21:21 Bad for whom, becomes the question. The people making money off of this can afford to ensure they're not exposed. Like the oil lobbyist who sued to prevent fracking near his property. Clearly, reality is overrated.
1381 2018-08-08 21:21:18 Apparently that will require 5x the area, palm oil is very high production per hectare
1382 2018-08-08 21:21:07 CBD Hemp Oil is used as a part of your diet to help maintain healthy Blood Levels.

1384 2018-08-08 21:20:57 There is no oil you Pratt, why do you think councillor leader of the NATIONALIST party of Scotland, lower case, is taking ours. You didn't mention the BARNETT FORMULA.

1389 2018-08-08 21:20:38 Then don't purchase oil to Venezuela, go ahead.
1390 2018-08-08 21:20:36 Takes more than cheap rhetoric to whitewash #Canada's Oil contracts in Sudan and phosphate contracts in Western-Sahara.

1391 2018-08-08 21:20:31 Last night I had no idea what people were talking about on my feed so the reasonable response was to POUR anti-aging oil all over my face cause old
1392 2018-08-08 21:20:30 Oh... so you mean you'll sell us your oil at your cost instead of the world market price then huh.
1393 2018-08-08 21:20:28 Bring my work car into Jiffy Lube to get an oil change. CLEARLY labeled car. Lady goes to try and sell me extra stuff (not allowed), hits the button on her computer and all that comes up. Her response? "Oh, I didn't know this was a fleet account!"

Think she was a bit pissed.
1394 2018-08-08 21:20:25 Oil is a finite resource. We will run out and it would be ridiculous to keep our infrastructure that we have on burning dinosaurs. 1000 watts per meters squared hits the earth’s surface every day . I’m sure we could put that energy to work for us.
1395 2018-08-08 21:20:25 Sulfur 8 and hot oil treatments
1396 2018-08-08 21:20:24 I know our government will say nothing but as a Brit I want to say thanks Canada for calling out Saudi Arabia on its human rights abuses. 

If Canada backs down it will set a dangerous precedent around the world. The US and UK governments are hopeless against Saudi oil money.

BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Remember this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault.
1400 2018-08-08 21:20:06 Does this suggest SA is at a disadvantage, as they’d need to make relationships for a diverse portfolio of goods, while Canada would just need a different source of oil?
1401 2018-08-08 21:20:03 @realDonaldTrump  If Turkey wants to keep using Iranian oil and gas they should not be allowed to get the F-35 from the US.
1402 2018-08-08 21:19:56 Because we cannot process bitumen.  Saudi oil is not bitumen.
1403 2018-08-08 21:19:28 Oil us oops I meant spoil us more !
1404 2018-08-08 21:19:22 Have you ever cooked with the oil from giardiniera

Obviously you have not.
1405 2018-08-08 21:19:21 To expand, citizens rallied for civil rights in the 60’s and got em.  Against big oil, private companies along with the epa and a public outcry got lead removed from gasoline in the 80’s & 90’s.  No authoritarian in either case.
1406 2018-08-08 21:19:18 Rubbish 

The confrontation with Iran is only about Iranian Oil & Gas. 

USA has no problem with the dictators in Saudi Arabia who behead more people than ISIS.
1407 2018-08-08 21:19:17 Why don't you work with the lege to adequately fund school districts, retired teachers' pensions, teachers' health insurance and get raises for all teachers.  There's shit-tons of money available for this now due to the health of the Texas economy and oil business.
1408 2018-08-08 21:19:12 Carex's argan oil and cocoa soap might be one of the best things I've ever smelled in my life tbh
1409 2018-08-08 21:19:09 We have no need for oil in 80 percent of the worlds daily activities anymore, and no, this doesnt mean we want overzealously rich barons to become broke;

It means we can successfully establish a standard of living that doesnt threaten the survival of our species. 

And live life

1432 2018-08-08 21:17:24 The sooner we expel Saudi Arabia from the civilized world the better we'll all be. They've never belonged but bought their way in. The collapse of the oil economy is coming and the Saudis will collapse with it. Good riddance.

1435 2018-08-08 21:16:51 So today i spilled coffee all over myself then oil. Then i sat two yellow cups next to each other. One filled with motor oil and one filled with sweet tea. Ask me which one i took a quick drink out of? 
#halfrobotprobably #didntdietho
1436 2018-08-08 21:16:42 And you buy their oil.  What are you complaining about?
1437 2018-08-08 21:16:39 Huh? So the "Public" will have no say in "Public" land issues. Astounding nerve of the GOP NRA Oil gang.
1438 2018-08-08 21:16:38 Can any one tell me what else of value besides oil, we buy from the Saudis? Really because honestly I don't know. And if it is just oil then tell them they can keep it and let's get eastern line built now!!
1439 2018-08-08 21:16:30 Is this why Canada is suddenly the bad guy? Embrace it, I say, they’re toxic and infect everything they touch. We have our own oil.
1440 2018-08-08 21:16:29 Saudi will turn off the taps and they’ll have to by western oil
1441 2018-08-08 21:16:26 like when you get new pots and pans youre suppose to coat it and cook off some oil before you ACTUALLY use it because it distributes heat better or something after - i usually use reclaim cause any dab you take first on your nail is usually burned wrong and wasted
1442 2018-08-08 21:16:20 yah, I heard you don't like the squishy food like bananas?  But you could try plantains...slice them into circles and deep fry them in oil...serve with some central american semi-seco (or seco) white cheese.

1443 2018-08-08 21:16:13 Ever drive by syncrude? Ever notice a big change one time when you went back?!ya that’s right, they moved the road to mine the oil under the road, no joke, it’s everywhere
1444 2018-08-08 21:15:39 im drinking on that mud like an oil spill
1445 2018-08-08 21:15:39 TIL that Canola is an acronym of "Canada" and "-ola," derived from other oil names like Mazola. It's processed from rapeseed, and of a special type developed at Manitoba U called "canola."
1446 2018-08-08 21:15:34 Simple dadagiri you can say. Else US will place sanctions on our export & import from US & our business with other countries too. Still we have not completely stopped Iranian oil. Mattis & Pompeo will be here in Sept. Let's see what offers they have.

1448 2018-08-08 21:15:30 lol oil moneyyyyyyyy
1449 2018-08-08 21:15:26 Saudi Arabia is playing a stupid game with Canada, we can cut off the 12 billion dollar military deal with Saudi Arabia, find a new partner like Qatar, and easily replace Saudi oil with Canadian oil to meet energy consumption demands of Quebec and New Brunswick.
1450 2018-08-08 21:15:24 Mettons surtout en avant la non croissance du charbon (et gaz) en France durant les années critiques.
1451 2018-08-08 21:15:18 And it isn’t even real snake oil! They squeeze out Don jr’s fair for the oil.
1452 2018-08-08 21:15:10 I don’t resent Buffalo or hope for the team’s failure.  As an Oil fan, I do tire of people taking joy in the Oilers failure to rebuild.  That’s why I responded to your tweet.  It seemed incongruous coming from a Buffalo fan, like a bullied child taking shots another victim.
1453 2018-08-08 21:15:08 And my feeling is that this was one of the reasons they made the deal in the first place. The Saudis we're pumping the shit out of their fields to drop the price to the point where our fields weren't profitable to pump. So by putting Iranian oil out there, u tweak......1/2
1454 2018-08-08 21:14:57 I didn’t say that, but syncrude and suncor etc didn’t put the oil in the ground. Oil has been flowing into the Athabasca river for hundreds of years, there literally oil everywhere up there, not only in the tailings ponds, so companies are cleaning up the oil,Mother Nature’s mess

1456 2018-08-08 21:14:51 The OP was clearly talking about the people who have already bought in, and in particular was referring to the "We should beat Alex Jones by debating him" idiocy.

You don't debate him. You show him to be a kook. You don't give him a chance to sell his snake oil in the process.
1457 2018-08-08 21:14:48 Why is getting a cars oil change the most soul sucking thing ever
1458 2018-08-08 21:14:46 A more open political process is not snake oil; it is essential for democracy to function. No candidate with faith in his/her agenda should fear greater voter participation.
1459 2018-08-08 21:14:36 I’m super glad we don’t have to pretend to either like or respect that ridiculous oil well dressed up like a country anymore.
Pull the plug & piss on Saudi Arabia - time to pull them out of Canada by the roots until they grow up.
1460 2018-08-08 21:14:34 If it break, the dam may break over the next month of so. Your thoughts though on November Iran Oil embargo preventing a tank in prices  (as I am far from an Oil expert but very curious as it effect the oil sector stocks)

1466 2018-08-08 21:13:59 Yes, we've been known to do that. The one on the right is when they try to run away, and we foil their escape by emitting an oil slick, batmobile style.

RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
1467 2018-08-08 21:13:54 This one is too easy.                Don’t forget your oil can, melting snow causes rust.
1468 2018-08-08 21:13:48 I just don't think oil and gold necessarily have a strong correlation. I see them going in opposite directions in the next few months. I also expect oil to bottom out well before 2020 but that's because I expect the global bust to be steep & fast & be mostly contained in 2019.
1469 2018-08-08 21:13:44 Engine oil and hydraulic fluid is already quite unpleasant, so I believe ya.

1471 2018-08-08 21:13:28 Anybody interested in buying gold should do so, by buying NUGT 3x Bull Gold Fund or lightly the futures with a stop-loss as it looks to be ready to rally. Oil appears to be heading to 62.50 or lower. #Commodities #Crude #Gold #Metals #Oil
1472 2018-08-08 21:13:27 *cough* why do the worlds major oil, shipping and insurance companies disagree with you?

Putin selling off 85% of U.S. debt, rising oil +secret deals w/top GOP &money laundering through Trump org, NRA and GOP is helping Putin not punishing. @maddow @CNNSitRoom @jaketapper @SethAbramson @donlemon @amjoyshow @allinwithchris @CapehartJ
1485 2018-08-08 21:11:49 Imagine if you @GOPLeader and colleagues actually believed in climate change and global warming that scientists have been warning about, yet you deny. Push for oil and coal, roll back protections/regulations, and then blame wildfires on not cutting down trees?
1486 2018-08-08 21:11:48 Yes, thank you for all of the rounds of golf, the cutting of veteran's benefits, the 1.5 triilion dollars added to the debt, the repeal of national lands for mining and oil, and the fight against equal rights. You truly are an inspiration to us all. #20for45 #Resist
1487 2018-08-08 21:11:44 Ya sure buddy. If it was not for Canadian and other Western oil tech you would be just another ME shithole.
1488 2018-08-08 21:11:41 Primo sharp Italian ... xtra oil and onions?
1489 2018-08-08 21:11:40 Have you ever been in an oil change shop where they aren't playing Maury or Jerry Springer? Pretty sure it's never happened. Do they have a special channel? I have a lot of questions.
1490 2018-08-08 21:11:40 I use coconut or olive oil to shallow fry. The oil should be deep enough just to coat half (height of halloumi). Turn it over once it's brown and fry the other side. Use a tall sided pan/pot as it makes quite a mess! It's SO good! #halloumi #keto #lchf #lowcarb.
1491 2018-08-08 21:11:31 Thanks for sharing this amazing oil and awesome deal!
1492 2018-08-08 21:11:30 Agree...still hoping to to replace that with Canadian oil.
1493 2018-08-08 21:11:28 Know the “Oil field trash” stickers? They should make a “Trump trash” one.
1494 2018-08-08 21:11:28 

Is it yhur anointing oil?? 
What if its just groundnut oil 
1495 2018-08-08 21:11:27 Canada can get its oil or gas from Russia, the world needs to place sanctions on saudi and Qatar. Usa uk can no longer be trusted in financial areas as both are doing more than just kissing saudis ar5e.
1496 2018-08-08 21:11:26 Et les inconscients comme @GoldbergNic ou EV croient que l'important est de faire savoir que fermer du nucléaire n'augmente pas le charbon. Sa non baisse rapide par manque de nuc et le gaz/pétrole, ils en parlent et le défendent peu.
1497 2018-08-08 21:11:05 So all the liberals are upset over the Saudi reaction but they were all fine buying their oil. Nothing has changed..... they violated human rights when we were buying their oil. #Hypocrisy
1498 2018-08-08 21:10:45 "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords." ~Psalms 55:21 #Jesus #God #Bible
1499 2018-08-08 21:10:44 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1500 2018-08-08 21:10:22 We don't get very much oil from KSA. The stick they are waving is a twig.
1501 2018-08-08 21:10:22 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
1502 2018-08-08 21:10:15 That must have been the customer demanding a Worcester ? I quoted a job today he wanted a Worcester and I quoted a vaillant, the less Worcester we fit the better, we hate Worcester hands! P.s does your customer need their oil tank draining my oil tank is getting low 
1503 2018-08-08 21:10:10 As long as we import their oil, nothing the government says is worth anything.

1511 2018-08-08 21:09:54 Also no oil changes, transmission fluid, spark plugs, starter, timing belt, brakes jobs. Just battery coolant every 4 yrs and windshield washer fluid as needed. 
It is fantastic.

Oh wait, I left my dog alone because I had to go out and get the oil changed in my car.
1515 2018-08-08 21:09:08 Sanctions on Russian oil  (+Iranian) would  put the price up elsewhere ,great for Trump and his cronies ,more demand for Saudi / Yank oil -a nice little earner !,As Russia cannot  extradict Russians by law the case will never come to court +will be buried !

Eeeeevil oil?

1524 2018-08-08 21:07:49 If SPX rallys t 3000 then it’s natural for gold t take that lead. That will normaly mean oil rallies too. T metall can though rally in panic, going opposite mrks, or essensially sending mrks straight down. Happened at worst fall days juring resession - short bursts of firesale.
1525 2018-08-08 21:07:33 Great opportunity here for Freeland and Trudeau to become heroes by repatriating Canadian oil, rather than building unpopular pipelines for export....Eh, eh?

1529 2018-08-08 21:07:19 Norway recently committed to stopping oil production and building green grid edge to edge.
1530 2018-08-08 21:07:07 Y'know, #DonaldTrump, aside from #fracking, some people think regular #oil drilling, the kind that extracts square miles every year for everyone's use, is already causing the greater number of #earthquakes with greater severity...  So, are you pushing the #apocalypse along here?
1531 2018-08-08 21:06:58 Chelsea ruining football with their oil money, could never be my club
1532 2018-08-08 21:06:45 China is sort of stuck. They need the oil and steel for their manufacturing. How can they function by preventing themselves from getting the raw materials from the US?
1533 2018-08-08 21:06:41 The secret is baby oil 
1534 2018-08-08 21:06:37 This is my first original oil on canvas.

1537 2018-08-08 21:06:06 Please tell us there will be prints of these so we can support your artistry  also is your medium oil on canvas!? 
1538 2018-08-08 21:06:05 Something else cooking. Is Trump preparing to invade canada, USA and Russia split the country, SA trying to help to get oil or shut it down??? I eould like to say thats absurd, but these days....
1539 2018-08-08 21:06:04 I would seriously like to know why so much of the world bows and scrapes before the the murderous thugs who run Saudi Arabia. I know they have lots of oil...but so does Iran and that doesn't protect them from being a pariah
1540 2018-08-08 21:06:03 At least you could moisturize with snake oil.
Trump’s empty promises are worthless.

1543 2018-08-08 21:05:52 Hahahaha more like PINK and in your case orange. There is no red wave. You’re a loser and a thief. A liar and a charlatan. Go  peddle your snake oil to Putin and Kim. #ItsMuellerTime and you will lose.

1548 2018-08-08 21:05:29 VENEZULA IS USING THE EXACT SAME PLAYBOOK AS THE USSR. They took the oil fields "for the people" and then they proceeded to fuck the country into the ground. Anyone with money saw the writing on the wall and left now everyone is starving except maduro
1549 2018-08-08 21:05:24 Venezuela's vast oil wealth was stolen by crooked politicians and crooked businessmen (Capitalism)- their financial problems have little to do with being socialist (a small amount, yes- but not enough to put them in the shape they're in now).
1550 2018-08-08 21:05:21 You are actually saying the jobs are not increasing and manufacturing is not up. Wake up. It is you who is the snake oil salesman.
1551 2018-08-08 21:04:38 Yeah, totally, thanks for your brilliant contribution.

psst: the oil lobby, pharma lobby, agribusiness lobby, etc. are all bigger than the Israel lobby....
1552 2018-08-08 21:04:16 I think gold is poised for a rally to $1550 this fall. How will that affect your oil forecast?
1553 2018-08-08 21:03:55 Coconut oil?
1554 2018-08-08 21:03:54 If it was up to me, Easter Canada wouldve been without SA oil a long time ago

1556 2018-08-08 21:03:20 Lol, there is a type of yam my grandma makes. So soft that the oil from the egg sauce will penetrate the yam and you won't know what hit you when you put it in your mouth.

For background, I read about about manufacturing electricity, gas and oil by the utility companies in the Mass General Laws. I thought this chemical process would be helpful: Light + heat+H2O+ CO2= C6H12+O2

We no longer require your oil to survive economically . We need to refine our own oil here in Canada not in the gulf coast ! Self reliant !!

1592 2018-08-08 20:59:45 Your house is on fire with all this international trade drama - promote #Alberta #Oil  - please.
1593 2018-08-08 20:59:42 " Canada spends ~$2.3 billion per year on Saudi oil imports."
Justifies the Energy East pipeline instead of the Keystone pipeline to the States, who pay $30/bbl less than market price, by discounting our heavy oil.
1594 2018-08-08 20:59:35 Must be differential oil that stuff stinks.
1595 2018-08-08 20:59:20 Iran also owed tens of billions of dollars on nonperforming loans to its energy and banking sectors. Iran’s demand for domestic investment surpassed $500 billion, and cost between $100 billion and $200 billion to restore production levels in its oil and gas sector.
1596 2018-08-08 20:59:10 The Saudi regime is at the exact opposite end of the spectrum when it come to humanity, free will and the pursuit of happiness. We don’t need to trade with countries like these and it’s a shame we import oil from them instead of relying on our own supply from the West.
1597 2018-08-08 20:59:02 I've just spent about 25 minutes voting repeatedly.... you were 3rd but now in the lead. I'll just oil my brass hand and get back to voting. There's no competition here, Bob and Paul have been the best thing on telly for a long while.

1619 2018-08-08 20:55:25 Concerned about #climatechange? Obvious starter for 10 - don’t do stuff for oil companies....
1620 2018-08-08 20:55:22 Club owners…has it always been madness?? 
United, Arsenal, Liverpool run by greedy American Sport owners.
City run by a murdering Oil Sheik.
Chelsea run by a moody Russian Oil tycoon.
Tottenham have Levy.
WTF
1621 2018-08-08 20:55:16 also G-d: ok Maccabees, go nuts, this oil will never run out

1624 2018-08-08 20:55:09 The car chases in mafia 3 are ass, it feels like I’m sliding a metal shit through a fucking oil spill
1625 2018-08-08 20:54:54 *news reporter holding a mic towards me* “so what made you decide to do this gallery of oil paintings of mole and rat making out at a picnic” 

thanks dan well first of all, thank you, all I can really tell you is I am an incorrigible gremlin.
1626 2018-08-08 20:54:42 whenever my car dealership say i gotta wait a hour to a hour and a half for a oil change they really mean 3 hours 
1627 2018-08-08 20:54:38 He'll probably win. They hate oil, he hates oil.
1628 2018-08-08 20:54:29 off the oil ®

1630 2018-08-08 20:54:16 i rly wanna get myself to draw more stuff in my sketchbooks every day but im always really sweaty and im super paranoid about getting skin oil stains on paper of any kind
1631 2018-08-08 20:54:11 I used Estée Lauder but it was trash for my skin because I tend to oil up. Now I combine a Becca primer with Fenty and Lancôme foundation. Kat Von D used to be a fav also but I no longer want to support her brand.
1632 2018-08-08 20:53:46 military, revoking the tax give away to the 1% and corps and by stopping paying farmers to farm, oil companies to make oil and telecommunications to telecommunicate.  the companies you buy gas, utilities and do business with are making record money AND getting govt gifts,
1633 2018-08-08 20:53:29 What's really happening in the markets now?? When you look and see the Ruble trending, Oil sells off, Bitcoin tanks, Ether tanks, the Pound is weak, the USD is at a critical price and FTSE seems to attracting new buyers. These are just my observations 
1634 2018-08-08 20:53:27 I hate it when your oil pans gets demolished by a rock 40 miles into your 3000 mile trip back to Utah. Left us completely stranded for the night and we saw a baby bear on our way out after getting rescued 
1635 2018-08-08 20:53:27 Um...I think the KSA has already done that.

Now if any good comes of this, it will be Canada using more Canadian Oil.  

The oil that these same Canadians you speak of, are against us producing and shipping.

The irony is sweet.
1636 2018-08-08 20:53:27 Мне понравилось видео "oxygen vs oil. ( part 2 ). кислород против масла. ( часть 2 )."
1637 2018-08-08 20:53:25 I'm totally okay with what you're doing. Take your oil money, your planes, your students, your investments and just go, leave and never comeback. We are not the same people. We have value differences that cannot be overcome. You're an ass backwards nation. Good riddance! 
1638 2018-08-08 20:53:25 I mean in terms of the Ethiopian context. The battle between federal and regional forces in Jiiga was not over oil.
1639 2018-08-08 20:53:06 A lady came into Vaughn’s today for an oil change with a dead fox in her back seat... I understand loving animals but roadkill in your car? No thx.
1640 2018-08-08 20:52:53 Quietly looking down, ashamed that their values are for sale for the price of a barrel of oil.

1642 2018-08-08 20:52:40 They are desperate for an oil state.
1643 2018-08-08 20:52:28 I JUST LEARNED THAT THERE ARE MAKEUP COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY USE SHARK LIVER OIL (SQUALENE/ANE) IN THEM. BRB DYING. I HAVE TO CHECK EVERYTHING I OWN OMG.
1644 2018-08-08 20:52:26 Temperature below zero degree Celsius affects the consistency, texture and sometimes the taste. Also, it should be noted that mayonnaise is an oil in water (emulsion) product, the separation of oil from the composition can be as a result of the properties of emulsifier used.
1645 2018-08-08 20:52:21 Again, the CIA’s director said that Saudi Arabia is the main country where terrorism is allowed to flourish. In fact, very little finance is needed to perpetuate an ideology and the US turns a blind eye because of oil.
1646 2018-08-08 20:52:21 Need my hair done, oil change, and car payment. My moneys already gone

1651 2018-08-08 20:51:54 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1652 2018-08-08 20:51:52 Because they are the “chosen ones” could help that the Saudis pour money into the country as well and they have the wealth and oil Sikhs and Hindus don’t so yes they will favour the former 
1653 2018-08-08 20:51:41 Thank you Lindsey. It seems that oil, gas and industries in #Europe are much more important for some European politicians rather than liberty for Iranians.

1658 2018-08-08 20:51:17 heads up cover your pan in foil and maybe a little oil. I didn't and now I'm gonna need to hella soak my pan, it's got crystallized honey on it -_-

1661 2018-08-08 20:51:00 i fucking love the smell of oil candles
1662 2018-08-08 20:50:58 Isn’t oil and gas all priced in US$? Which has appreciated against the £ because of a decision backed by the Express (and its readers). But I don’t suppose that is mentioned in this story.
1663 2018-08-08 20:50:57 this oil i have burning in my room smells so fucking good

1665 2018-08-08 20:50:26 You bet the oil sands in Alberta Canada produce ethical oil!
To smear the hard working people of Canada that are employed directly or indirectly and insinuate that Canada is the same as Saudi Arabia is discussting!
1666 2018-08-08 20:50:21 Just. Buy. Dried.

What was that recipe for tomato sauce again? Tomato’s strained and olive oil wasn’t it? Want to do it for lunch and can’t remember if that’s all that was involved.
1667 2018-08-08 20:50:20 Tomorrow a big protest in Canada chanting #We_dont_need_Saudi_oil

1670 2018-08-08 20:50:09 A baker on R4 earlier today bemoaned the rising prices for supplies due to the pound declining. He then went on to say he'd voted 'leave' but it hadn't affected his business so far. Re petrol etc an oil & gas expert last week offered the insight that 'prices go up & down'.
1671 2018-08-08 20:50:09 When ya bro said the stuff for oil change should be less than $20.. why is you lying.. but like the oil was like on sale lol I guess 
1672 2018-08-08 20:49:55 I agree.  We have plenty of oil.  Would be nice to be able to use most of it in Canada.
1673 2018-08-08 20:49:54 We can just sell it to China, who can swap it for oil.

1679 2018-08-08 20:49:39 Senseless dictatorial overreaction. Good thing the existence of Canada is not dependant on your bloody oil money
1680 2018-08-08 20:49:30 It grows into a tree, and a snake oil salesman tries to monetize it. He sets up a booth at Whole Foods. Some hippie lady tries the everything fruit and gives some to her begrudging partner. After that, they have to take the ring to Mordor. It happens.

1686 2018-08-08 20:48:52 I know. Because Brunei, Qatar, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, etc, own and control everything within their jurisdictions.

Heck, they even distribute food to their people. They sell oil and pay people who literally do nothing for income.

Yet, because they trade ...
1687 2018-08-08 20:48:23 Literally wouldn’t be a problem if your Democrats stopped playing ball for oil corps and got serious on climate change though

You can't make this shit up! 
1691 2018-08-08 20:48:06 Nah.  Sorry bud, I'd rather poke my eyes out with a rusty hacksaw blade whilst boiling my knackers in old engine oil than endure the misery of having to watch overpaid eejits hurling themselves at the ground in the hope of gaining an advantage over his equally goon opponents.
1692 2018-08-08 20:47:55 If to light Petersburg w/ electricity it's necessary that the smallest number of lives should perish, then let Petersburg be lighted by oil.
1693 2018-08-08 20:47:54 I would assume that MLA's are doing regular oil changes, but if you go 80k between them, you have no engine left anyways.  Even if you only have two receipts, with the date on them and mileage, you can determine kms travelled, in between.  Only issue is separating private use.
1694 2018-08-08 20:47:43 Million watt Propaganda machine. Iran must reform( of course it is still million times better than Saudi Barbaria), but it is about oil and Golan heights and steered by the lobby of only nuclear power in mid east - Israel. Half a million deaths in Syria was nothing for them!
1695 2018-08-08 20:47:42 The point you all are missing is the fact that a lot of jobs men do are extremely physical and dangerous. How many women do you know who want a job in construction? Mining? Oil rigs? Not many. When you compare the pay with equal types of work you then discover it is nonexistent.
1696 2018-08-08 20:47:41 You're government treats you like little children. They control your lives. The rest of the world knows not to believe anything you say. You can't be trusted, if you didn't have oil nobody would even look at your garbage country

1705 2018-08-08 20:46:52 Plus of course the small matter of securing at least $100 million in funding from an offshore oil services group to deliver the project. I’d argue the term funding isn’t as cut and dry as some seem to think it is and depends on a lot of unknowns!

1711 2018-08-08 20:45:20 A destabilized Ukraine would allow for the military aggression undertaken by Russia plus the military industrial complex, oil industry and other services profiting from the chaos.

1713 2018-08-08 20:45:08 The economic miscreants posting here on Harper's supposed misdeeds also ignore the calamitous drop in oil prices that hit Canada/Harper in 2014.  A recession would be ours were it not for good oil prices and a hot USA economy. Yet Trudeau still runs deficits  ~$20billion/yr

1719 2018-08-08 20:44:39 Today my car almost didn't start AND I can hear my breaks squeaking.

1726 2018-08-08 20:43:36 hey kids check out our cool new military industrial complex! you too can invade countries for oil one day
1727 2018-08-08 20:43:32 Also this forgets that a lot of cultural staples are really expensive in the USA/Canada like quinoa, avacado, seasame oil, ect.
1728 2018-08-08 20:43:27 See Twitter has now turned the Edtech debate into talk of snake oil etc. I don’t deny some people are raking it in, but they are few and far between, I assure you. I work with startups who have worked for free for two years just making a useable product ready for schools. 1/4
1729 2018-08-08 20:43:13 Derek, a good addition would be requirement to submit oil change receipts (from authorized service outlets) that contain the mileage.  With those bills, you can put together a pretty good picture of mileage usage over a given period. Logs are too easy to fudge. #ableg

1731 2018-08-08 20:43:07 So when the Venezuelans stopped getting wealth from other capitalists nations for their oil, the rest of their nation and programs suffered because there's nothing left over to upgrade and improve what went wrong.
1732 2018-08-08 20:42:59 Sorry, I didn’t know. I can chop them differently, that’s no big deal. Normally I would put the tarter on the side, but I don’t have any little cups for that. I could have put it to the side on the actual plate, but the paper towels were in the way, and I need those to absorb oil

Scotland is there , just needs the independence and determination to do it.

1766 2018-08-08 20:37:25 I am guessing because the PP w/McDavid was dead last & the Oil are in major need of a Dman to make those first passes out of the zone to the forwards and QB the PP from the point with a good point shot. It was a major need. But if Bouchard is not ready then he is just not ready.

Perhaps because, in relation to other EU members in Eastern Europe, Scotland is a wealthy nation and would be an economic asset to the EU.
Perhaps because Scotland owns 65% of oil in the EU area.
Just a few reasons.

1794 2018-08-08 20:34:59 Well maybe those extra measures would be to stop their export of oil to Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. Then mostly Quebec will wish they had a pipeline from western Canada filling refineries because their fuel could get expensive. That would be ironic now.

1860 2018-08-08 20:27:36 If I catch the drift, #TraitorTrump personally was paid to reimpose Iran sanctions to raise the price of oil? That ties together with the effort to overturn CA's tough emission and mileage rules, which will increase demand for oil and simultaneously remove Irani oil from market.

1871 2018-08-08 20:26:29 My opinion is that reimplemented sanctions would keep some Iranian oil off the market, meaning more for SA and UAE to sell

1884 2018-08-08 20:24:48 I didn’t have WD-40 for my sliding door cause it squeaks so loud, so my dad goes “nen, I just put frying oil ”  good morning to me
1885 2018-08-08 20:24:42 My client asked me to come up with an icebreaker for tomorrow's big "summit." Instead of the usual team building BS, I'm bringing in Snake Oil!
1886 2018-08-08 20:24:32 @MBuhari  wants to build refinery in the north for oil that is in the south and ranches in the south for cows in the north
1887 2018-08-08 20:24:21 Even if it's bad economically for us, we shouldn't be dealing with Saudi Arabia, a disgusting, backwards country with a terrible human rights record. Other countries should sanction and shun SA until it changes its medieval laws, but that won't happen because they've got OIL $$$.
1888 2018-08-08 20:24:20 You can see the panic in the eyes of may and fox most definitely. Gang of other snake oil sellers are too well practiced. STOP brexit.
1889 2018-08-08 20:23:58 @JustinTrudeau - I support your firm stance on Saudi Arabia. Human Rights advocacy should never have a price tag. Would love to see us halt imports of some 100K+ barrels of oil per day in retaliation and replace it with AB/SK/NL oil!
1890 2018-08-08 20:23:47 @KSAmofaEN 
Fuck Saudi Arabia. Your backwards medieval kingdom has no place in this world. We dont need your oil. And we certainly dont need your tuition money or wheat sales. And if it were up to me, we would take back the military hardware we sold you. Eat shit you cave people!
1891 2018-08-08 20:23:41 Venezuela was doing fairly well until global market fluctuations on the price of oil. Market fluctuations are endemic to capitalism, not socialism.
1892 2018-08-08 20:23:41 Growing up my dad worked on an offshore oil platform on a week-on week-off shift. I think it helped me develop an appreciation for time apart early on. Also I didn't have that experience of him tired at the end of a standard work day; mostly when he was home he was fully present.
1893 2018-08-08 20:23:40 I must go through fork seals like @richthejoiner goes through oil 
1894 2018-08-08 20:23:35 Man I knew I shoulda went Louetta Auto. They drop a nigga off at the crib in the 2012 Toyota Venza til my oil change is finished AND they come scoop me when the work is done...
1895 2018-08-08 20:23:27 I really don't know but I imagine that applying Coconut oil and then take a shower and let the water run on your face for like 5 minutes would do the trick. Hot water would probably work better. I accidently ran water on my face and they came off..
1896 2018-08-08 20:23:25 did you also get the olive oil email

We're good man! Keep the oil, by all means 
1898 2018-08-08 20:23:17 You and me both. Remember drilling oil filler hole in that lump of a gearbox housing. Did those spring locking bolts on the electronics bay drive you up the wall as well? Acoms R/C gear in yours also?
1899 2018-08-08 20:22:57 It's insane Eastern Canada imports oil and Alberta can't sell their oil.
Pipeline shoulda been built decades ago.
Stupid Canada.
Stupid politicians.
1900 2018-08-08 20:22:56 Let’s say G7 refusal to back sanctions against Iran maybe.  They are both Middle East countries right?  Let them argue amongst each other and use our own Oil.
1901 2018-08-08 20:22:53 When I was a kid my mum always described herself as olive skinned, never saw olives until older but she did put warm olive oil in our ears (wax???). Assumed it meant yellowy
1902 2018-08-08 20:22:50 You don’t seem so concerned about big oil when the Saudi’s are buying in?

1906 2018-08-08 20:22:25 Alberta oil sells mostly to the US. Limited ways to get it to tidewater to sell overseas at world prices. So the US hoses us on the price. No pipeline to send Western Canadian oil to MTL.

1909 2018-08-08 20:22:05 It's going to be funny when our new Iranian allies shut down the Straight of Hormuz. You can choke on your oil.

1911 2018-08-08 20:22:00 Trump will be in there buying their oil so they know they have no worries
1912 2018-08-08 20:21:51 Wrap your lips around an oil well and suck it. Pay? You people are a burden to the world. Someone should pay. To have you all removed from power.
1913 2018-08-08 20:21:39 An oil change makes such a difference love it
1914 2018-08-08 20:21:33 Cowards, no balls & Oil.
1915 2018-08-08 20:21:32 We certainly don't need them for oil, that's for sure.  Our PM thinks differently as he doesn't want the pipeline to go through...
1916 2018-08-08 20:21:32 Yesterday I told Maiyah I was gonna give her a baby oil butt whoopin 
1917 2018-08-08 20:21:32 I slice them up, cook them in a pan with minced onion and olive oil, then toss some feta in at the very end. Delicious.
1918 2018-08-08 20:21:28 no bay leaf? no garlic? no lemon? no olive oil? the disrespect
1919 2018-08-08 20:21:26 Well said, apple cider vinegar is a nice condiment, but if you don't stick to a proper diet and put the work in you won't get lean or ripped. :) - Sorry snake oil folk..
1920 2018-08-08 20:21:25 I am going full tinfoil here: saudis just bought big shares in Tesla&Elon saying  he might go all private. Coincidence? Tesla: non oil friendly so why saudi money?

1922 2018-08-08 20:21:12 So I just had half a bottle of scented oil spill on me in the middle of an aisle and of course the only csm available was the hella dismissive one who I had to ask questions at least 3 times before she would answer them directly
1923 2018-08-08 20:21:03 Because mining, logging, and oil/natural gas companies hate the ESA, they see it as nothing but a barrier to their profits. Trump see's it as a barrier in his plan to MAGA (he believes environmental regulations have contributed to American economic decline).
1924 2018-08-08 20:21:00 Dead & dying timber due to drought made worse by climate change. Oh, but let's drill oil off the coast & sell off public lands so your cronies can drill even more. Then let's deforest what's left of our forests, because... those pesky fires. Idiot.

1926 2018-08-08 20:20:46 Not just check the oil, DRAIN this oil. Every last drop.
1927 2018-08-08 20:20:31 maybe you should check out how much subsidies your country pays to gas and oil companies for them to keep doing what they always did and would continue to do without them. That is the trully disgracefull state of affairs
1928 2018-08-08 20:20:25 Dear Green Party,
You are essentially voting Republican.
Your vacation will look like this:
Sitting on a polluted stinking beach eating asbestos tainted sandwiches while looking out to sea at oil rigs pumping & spilling to MAGrungyA.
That’s not Green. That’s Red. #colorblind
1929 2018-08-08 20:20:16 The payoff was %20 of our uranium for the 2008 election.. the payoff for 2012 was scrapping the missile defense planned for Poland so Putin could enter Ukraine & take Crimea. Further payback was done by blocking pipelines & permits for US oil & gas.. limiting global competition

That is impressive seemings I cant do one.
1933 2018-08-08 20:19:48 Good news for Pakistan 

ExxonMobil is close to discovering huge oil reserves in Pakistan near the border with Iran, and those reserves could even be larger than the oil reserves of Kuwait.
1934 2018-08-08 20:19:47 Better hope somebody doesn't mistake them as a daily dose of their fish oil supplements
1935 2018-08-08 20:19:42 Also: "I HAVE AN ESSENTIAL OIL FOR THAT!"
1936 2018-08-08 20:19:35 The man's name is literally just "Oil"
1937 2018-08-08 20:19:34 Medical insurance. The modern snake oil! There are laws against bait & switch, but they are null and void when it comes to insurance.

1943 2018-08-08 20:18:31 Pipelines transport a wide variety of oil products.  Bitumen, various grades of refined oil, gasoline, petrochemical products.  We need both refineries and pipelines.
1944 2018-08-08 20:18:31 Think there is enough oil for a few hundred years right?

1949 2018-08-08 20:18:17 olive oil trash anyways, use coconut oil
1950 2018-08-08 20:18:05 Excuse me? Resolve what? End sharia law in Saudi Arabia how? The Saudis waged economic warfare on all of the Americas by dropping the price of oil to 30 a barrel. There is NOTHING to like about them and the fact they're acting like this makes me think they finally got nukes ffs.
1951 2018-08-08 20:17:59 All this falls on Trudeau.  Support our own oil, build pipelines and refine here. Stop being indebted to these middle eastern countries.
1952 2018-08-08 20:17:41 But Canada need their oil! Billions of $ every year!
1953 2018-08-08 20:17:37 Coconut oil them roots girl
1954 2018-08-08 20:17:36 What a bad time to be saddled with such a clueless PM. Oil industry blocked, trade deals failure, cultural invasion and illegal immigration, substitution and sacrilegious denial of the countrie's cultural god.
1955 2018-08-08 20:17:35 Saudi Arabia pulling their students and hospital patients out of Canada over twitter comment. GOOD now Canadians won't have to wait for hospital beds and overcrowded schools. Why are they here anyways? All that oil money they should be able to build schools and hospitals #cdnpoli

1957 2018-08-08 20:17:15 i use an exfoliating wash cloth on my face once a day (or depending on the condition of my skin) & moisturize with almond oil or shea butter :)
1958 2018-08-08 20:17:09 "Crown prince are you sure we should go after Canada?"

"Yes of course...that Trudeau fool has crippled their energy sector and they depend upon our oil plus we all know his allies are tired of his virtue signalling BS..they will quietly high five me later"
1959 2018-08-08 20:17:06 My apologies. I mean when Trump did his OPEC rant and demanded more oil, the trade war between Canada and America had just begun.
1960 2018-08-08 20:16:59 I really don’t be feeling like washing my hair  & I don’t have a hot it oil treatment 
1961 2018-08-08 20:16:57 I use coconut oil or e.l.f. brand wipes. I always burn with any other products  I can't even use normal sunscreen on my face
1962 2018-08-08 20:16:54 Don't forget, unless U R so naive, that Iran will block 1/3 of the OIL shipping off their Cost Golf that the Cost will sky rocket
1963 2018-08-08 20:16:53 You know what really keeps me awake at night? I know the "squeaking wheel gets the oil," but I often feel like if I didn't constantly advocate for and advertise myself, people would probably just forget that I exist altogether. That's both sad...and a little terrifying.
1964 2018-08-08 20:16:45 Will vouch for @airvistara. Had a great flight with them this afternoon. Can't say the same for @IndiGo6E. In the next counter a guy had coconut oil leak into his bag and IndiGo was back to behaving like ChIndiGo. The guy wasn't even carrying it. Poor guy was being hassled.

1973 2018-08-08 20:15:32 OPEC has been controlling oil prices for almost sixty years now. Have Canada been in trade wars that long?
1974 2018-08-08 20:15:14 おはごなんですわ
1975 2018-08-08 20:15:04 And in case you're interested, my view is that the global oil industry will indeed face just such a demand growth slowdown (it has a small taste of it already) and it will be both normal and also ugly.
1976 2018-08-08 20:14:50 I was always a “shell oil” guy.
1977 2018-08-08 20:14:30 Too late! Don’t you remember? Trudeau changed the rules for approval. The Quebec mayors let it be known they didn’t want to risk an oil spill despoiling their pristine rivers of raw sewage.
1978 2018-08-08 20:14:30 Yes, the Twin Decline in Ag and Oil Prices Really Hurt the State. Since We Don't Spend Much on Military Issues, Cutting Education Funding - and Amending the Constitution to Allow the People's House to Do That - Might Be Necessary

1981 2018-08-08 20:14:26 If its caused by ear wax, what I do is grab some olive oil or canola oil and put some of that in my ear, then lay on your side so the olive oil soaks in further. After about twenty minutes, use a syringe with warm or hot water while tilting your head back the other way. ^_^
1982 2018-08-08 20:14:24 /rlt/ guys disini ada ga yg suka pake aromatherapy yg kaya di spa gt? Kalo ada rekomen dong oil yg wanginya enak apa
1983 2018-08-08 20:14:22 Agreed! Metal filters absorb less of the soluble caffeine and will not retain as much the oil in coffee ground, consequently delivers deeper taste.
1984 2018-08-08 20:14:15 My document no make ready? Keep some of the oil in your drawer at work pls. I go come take.
1985 2018-08-08 20:14:05 It's ok if they are pointed at Conservatives, I guess.  #doasisaynotwhatido
1986 2018-08-08 20:14:02 They have been "Terrible" The hypocrisy is blatant, this dumb-ass couldn't even answer the question. Good old oil and gas.
1987 2018-08-08 20:14:02 According to the WWF, every hour an area of rainforest the size of 300 football fields is cleared to make way for palm oil to be grown - devastating for the animals that live there, as well as having a catastrophic effect on the environment
1988 2018-08-08 20:13:43 Am I correct in saying the $3b covers only a 1/3 of Jamaica's oil import? If so, would you agree with me the gov't actions at the time was mendacious?
1989 2018-08-08 20:13:30 If ya booty cheeks extra black ladies, put tree tea oil on it every night.... thank me later 
1990 2018-08-08 20:13:24 Happy Wednesday !!! I just spilled a full slick of oil in my car !
1991 2018-08-08 20:13:24 Hey, whatever happened to all the "ethical oil" apostles in the Tory ranks (@jkenney - crickets) who were always so quick to trot out Saudi human rights abuses to justify the tarsands.#stopthetarsands
1992 2018-08-08 20:13:23 With this crap over Saudi Arabia and selling cheap oil to the US and No pipelines to get our oil out to other markets, I’d say Canada as a whole is Ruined by the Groper sitting on his ass doing absolutely sweet piss all. I’m for a election ASAP too. I just hope No NDP/Liberals

1995 2018-08-08 20:13:13 I don't share the belief in a notable debt-bomb hanging over new-era oil and gas resources beyond the typical risk that has always hung over capital intensive resource extraction: it's a biz that can get ugly fast when demand growth slows down.
1996 2018-08-08 20:13:09 Love  it. Here’s some of my favorite ideas. Coconut  oil - I haven’t bought body lotion or shave gel in years. Soap Berries for laundry & toilet paper made from recycled  paper. @WhoGivesACrapTP makes % #plasticfree TP.
1997 2018-08-08 20:13:06 Trudeau is an idiot, but the Saudi government is primitive, savage and barbaric. Let’s stop buying their oil, build pipelines and use our oil. Let’s also make sure we elect adults to govern Canada in the next federal election. Trudeau is still not ready!
1998 2018-08-08 20:13:02 Here at Johnson and Johnson we only squeeze the oil from the best quality of baby to make a bottle of our world famous Johnson’s baby oil. Each bottle contains the oil of 7 babies lovingly squeezed by hand from the baby farms deep in the Madagascan rain forests.

2001 2018-08-08 20:12:38 Yes I do know that however UAE and the other gulf states have backed SA. They are preparing their economy for when the oil runs out.
2002 2018-08-08 20:12:35 Nah it's too high income, might as well study education reform in Dubai (the "Find masses of oil" strategy)
2003 2018-08-08 20:12:32 @jmv #askpat Use Robi Oil for your outdoor furniture . I can hook you up if interested, maybe you can give it some love on air too.
2004 2018-08-08 20:12:19 Yes, she kept bringing up the part about oil, oil is seriously the last thing on the agenda here. I didn't really take note of it, but you may be right. It could be part of an attempt to conceal the fact that the Liyu Police expenses were once tabled by the British tax payer.
2005 2018-08-08 20:12:14 Coat them with castor oil every night. You'll see a difference after a while!
2006 2018-08-08 20:12:13 Sure except when Quebec needs oil!
2007 2018-08-08 20:12:11 Low key I’m angry that my post about black women being under paid compared to their counterparts has only a few likes, but a fellow black woman with her bikini riding up her ass as she drips in baby oil has all the likes and comments. 
2008 2018-08-08 20:12:08 Put my car in the shop for a $100 oil change..... got the car back after comin out pocket 3k 
2009 2018-08-08 20:12:07 I feel like oil changes ran me like 17 bucks when I first started driving...now it's hard to find one under $40.
2010 2018-08-08 20:12:05 First tires now this oil change throw the whole car away at this point
2011 2018-08-08 20:12:04 Is that why I am having all these horrendous dental problems? Well I never, I must thank each tooth in future when I brush. Damn. So much for my electric toothbrush and my Neem and Tea Tree Oil toothpaste 
2012 2018-08-08 20:12:03 Did anyone with half a brain really believe Mexico was going to pay for a wall we don’t want or need?

Us half-brainers know Trump’s a snake oil salesman. It’s the 30% + @GOP criminals that need convincing.
2013 2018-08-08 20:11:57 Do you realize that they are basically offering you a months pay to go away. The skinny of this deal is that they are lowballing you to go away. For the sake of everyone else in the world trying to break away from the grip of oil don’t do it.
2014 2018-08-08 20:11:33 Attention Sunshine Friends!!!!

2015 2018-08-08 20:11:32 Iran vows to continue oil exports despite Trump's threats @AJENews. All countries supporting Iran do it only for economic gain & not out of love for her including EU, China, Russia & UK
2016 2018-08-08 20:11:28 Seafoam is the only additive I’ve never heard a bad thing about. Really good at cleaning out all the oil that gets in your intake.
2017 2018-08-08 20:11:24 go cry more about how a snake oil salesman who literally still has a massively popular website was censored
2018 2018-08-08 20:11:18 Likely all a ploy to create a reason for it to become okay to develop oil and gas in Canada. He screwed the pooch on that and the only way he can recover is to create a ‘crisis’ he can solve...win for the companies, minimal grief from the leftists, and election points
2019 2018-08-08 20:11:15 why should we believe anything #US says?They dont give a fuck about #Skripals  ?They want to stop #NordStream2 and this is just another attempt to blame boogeyman #Russia  .  @realDonaldTrump cares about #Skripals just as much as he cares about #Syria #Iran etc civilians  #oil
2020 2018-08-08 20:11:08 My husband worked oil field for the last 15 years. He was laid off in 2016. He is working now, but had to step out of his field and his comfort zone. The reality is  they may not find a job in their field making $100 an hour. But there are jobs if they are willing to work.
2021 2018-08-08 20:11:05 Saudi Arabia is acting like a spoiled child. Oh, because you have oil we can't criticize you? Well... we have oil too. Canada shouldn't move an inch on this issue. #Cndpoli
2022 2018-08-08 20:11:02 Actually, their oil is referred to as sweet crude 
And bitumin is as dirty as it gets.
However, to your point, Canada has plenty of oil.
On your side here, Al
2023 2018-08-08 20:11:00 Drew is negative and is always comparing the Sharks past to the Oil's present. I look forward to a more pro-Oiler take on the regional games
2024 2018-08-08 20:10:55 I like sugar snap peas. Nice amount of crispy and sweet. Also plain air popped popcorn, sometimes with a little bit of salt, but no oil. Because that leaves fingerprints everywhere.
2025 2018-08-08 20:10:46 I literally have to wait 2 and a half hours for an oil change 
2026 2018-08-08 20:10:46 Pompeo's an idiot, he'll understand that when Russia moves to the Euro and the Yuan selling oil and gas.
2027 2018-08-08 20:10:41 This is one thing I can’t get into the heads of all my peace loving noninterventionist liberal friends: we can’t afford to sit back and let Putin get even more oil and money via the ME to fund his conquest dreams. Ask Ukraine and Georgia, the Russians want more and won’t stop!
2028 2018-08-08 20:10:39 Trumpler really is a snake oil salesman.
2029 2018-08-08 20:10:38 I know what you mean, and it's not untrue. I would just put a bit of shading on that concept now, because a decade ago unconventional oil was a new-new thing, and since then the learning rate got to work on it. But yes, it's part of the reason we never went back to $25 oil.
2030 2018-08-08 20:10:34 Numbers 7:67 His offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering: #HolySpirit
2031 2018-08-08 20:10:34 Coming soon to an oil terminal near you...The Jagmeet.
2032 2018-08-08 20:10:33 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost Hey Michelle todays EIA #;s had NOTHING to do with the #oil tank - IT ALL happened BEFORE 7:00am due to #Iran comments
2033 2018-08-08 20:10:30 Why is palm oil now in most foods?
2034 2018-08-08 20:10:18 Nigeria should have been a vibrant example in the production and distribution of electricity to all parts of the country and also exporting, considering their rich oil reserves. #itsashame
2035 2018-08-08 20:10:16 Yes maybe olive oil
2036 2018-08-08 20:10:11 /rlt/ guys disini ada ga yg suka pake aromatherapy yg kaya di spa gt? Kalo ada rekomen dong oil yg wanginya enak apa
2037 2018-08-08 20:10:08 cannabis oil kills cancer - in dogs, too.  all vertebrates have endocannabinoid systems & NEED cannabis.  my dog had cyst on his wrist & cannabis oil took it away, I got picture documentation, it took 8 weeks, never came back.
2038 2018-08-08 20:10:05 I appreciate the sentiment, but the carrier oil of those extracts are problematic for certain health profiles like mine. #excuses
2039 2018-08-08 20:10:04 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2040 2018-08-08 20:10:03 Oil is their business and you are hurting their business. You can win this chess match. They are offering you 2 billion dollars to go away. What Tesla has the possibilities of doing is worth trillions of dollars. #DoNotDoIT!!!!
2041 2018-08-08 20:09:57 i need a damn oil change 
2042 2018-08-08 20:09:49 A report for the Bank of England, which considered using palm oil in the production of the new £20 note has said, "Forest fires, started to clear land for oil palm, release high levels of carbon dioxide and black carbon (soot) into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change."
2043 2018-08-08 20:09:46 Perfectly expressed.Asbestos,RoundUp,oil pipe lines. So many protections they don't care about because it's profit to them & poison to those who must live in affected areas. Like guns. Trump properties are gun free, for example, but he takes $ from NRA who dont want GunFreeZones
2044 2018-08-08 20:09:38 lmfao i’m shook by your expensive taste  the moroccan oil infusion been doing wonders for me for years 
2045 2018-08-08 20:09:37 I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil painting
2046 2018-08-08 20:09:31 One Israel airstrike caused a huge fire in an oil factory in Gaza
2047 2018-08-08 20:09:28 Pompeo's an idiot, he'll understand that when Russia moves to the Euro and the Yuan selling oil and gas.
2048 2018-08-08 20:09:17 As I dey see u now,if them send u go NYSC program those girls don die 
2049 2018-08-08 20:09:11 I buy your oil after reading Mark Avery!
2050 2018-08-08 20:09:09 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i lost acnl again dude bukc SIR please let him live.
2051 2018-08-08 20:08:44 Stopped taking my anxiety medication because it wasn't helping my anxiety. Decided to try CBD oil because there have been studies saying it might help with anxiety. One of the possible side effects of CBD oil? Anxiety 
2052 2018-08-08 20:08:41 Loreal kmrn gue nyoba salah shade wkwkw hasilnya lumayan sih. Gak seoxi mebelin. Oil controlnya cucok gak matte bgt. Kalo fit me matte nya rada matte(?) Trus lumayan ngeemphasize tekstur gue gitu~
2053 2018-08-08 20:08:35 Olive Oil
get a q-tip and dip it into olive oil then put it on your brows. Leave it in for a few hours then wash it off.
2054 2018-08-08 20:08:34 Dropped my phone in a bucket of oil and it still works
2055 2018-08-08 20:08:34 From 2004 till 2008 @FT reported the Middle East oil powers bought $750 billion worth of weaponry.
These weaponry will have to be used & replenish for the arms production line of Western armaments firms to continue rolling.
Plenty of cheap money sloshing around the globe. #Yemen
2056 2018-08-08 20:08:09 了解です
2057 2018-08-08 20:08:06 Someone said it tasted like they used palm oil 
2058 2018-08-08 20:08:02 made my own body lotion & i love it!! 

1 cup coconut oil (solid)
1 tsp vitamin E (i broke liquid tablets)
kitchen aid it together and pour into a mason jar/wide reusable jar.
2059 2018-08-08 20:07:54 no palm oil because it already destroyed more than half of forests in indonesia & only 400 tigers are left, a bit more but also near extinction orangutans, elephants, rhinos & many other animals.
2060 2018-08-08 20:07:42 I use cocoa nut oil in the glass jar and rice water
2061 2018-08-08 20:07:39 Why would Montreal buy saudi oil if it is cheaper to buy alberta oil sold at less than OPEC prices?
2062 2018-08-08 20:07:38 Anyone, what's your favorite night time oil blends to diffuse? 
#YoungLiving #EssentialOils
2063 2018-08-08 20:07:36 I used Bio oil & also tie your tummy with a scarf or doek ..so it cn tuck bck in.
2064 2018-08-08 20:07:36 Why now, this country is under the leadership of comedians and jokers....I can see that the oil money is really their problem
2065 2018-08-08 20:07:33 Hooray! Returning to old era fossil fuel instead of training for jobs of the future. Dirty energy that polluted air, water, soil. Did they also deregulate so the industry does not pay for oil spill damage?
2066 2018-08-08 20:07:15 That’s an insult to snake oil salesmen everywhere.
2067 2018-08-08 20:07:14 I stopped using factor 30 cream years ago, it just soaked into my skin and I always burned! For over 10 years now I’ve used Hawaiian Tropic factor 6 oil! It’s much better! Haven’t burned since I switched!
2068 2018-08-08 20:07:12 You said it yourself in your tweet. Saudi has money and oil, the UK is weak from Brexit and the US has a russian puppet in charge.
2069 2018-08-08 20:07:11 ahh but that's not an oil pipeline easier to clean up any spills.
2070 2018-08-08 20:06:54 C section takes a while to heal depending on your body, but for stretch mark use Bio oil

2077 2018-08-08 20:05:37 I wonder what "stand up" means. Hopefully it means something more than tweeting. Is it too much to hope for an oil embargo?
2078 2018-08-08 20:05:25 The Old Snake Oil Salesman is still batting 0 and a bunch.
2079 2018-08-08 20:05:06 He's a snake oil saleman and @RepHuizenga is a MI distributor.  I wonder if he owns stock?
2080 2018-08-08 20:05:06 Dilute tea tree oil and dab on your problem spots and then use aloe Vera from the plant every single night!!

2082 2018-08-08 20:04:43 Lol I’m on dat oil whole time
2083 2018-08-08 20:04:36 Sitting in the waiting room while my oil changed which means I get to watch Fox News.
2084 2018-08-08 20:04:34 Gotta get my oil changed tomorrow, and finish getting the rest of my baby’s gifts .. & I’m ready for Friday 
2085 2018-08-08 20:04:26 stop buying Saudi oil. 

Build pipelines and compete with them.
2086 2018-08-08 20:04:19 A bit of a over reaction to a tweet though . Canada has oil too so not too worried
2087 2018-08-08 20:04:07 ขออนุญาตดูดคลิปลงทวิตนะคะ เราตามหาคลิปที่เสียงชัดแบบนี้มานานแล้วอะ
2088 2018-08-08 20:04:02 also stop eating cheese, milk, & butter while you’re at it and use more olive oil. not cause animal products aren’t the best, they are, but because i don’t want you to get heart disease like every other american :)
2089 2018-08-08 20:03:46 @Kurochigami thank you for always rubbing my back with virgin oil when times got tough
2090 2018-08-08 20:03:36 @AdeBanqie D way PDP a.k.a CONGREGATED LOOTERS deploy their tactics I can  tell you their next moves.. watch out for 1. PMB want to stop funding of PDP campaign 2. INEC want to rig election for APC 3. PMB is not fit for office. 4. Debt 5. PMB want to take over SS because of oil..
2091 2018-08-08 20:03:34 you just have to properly saturate the palm oil - ancient craftsmanship
2092 2018-08-08 20:03:20 "We believe in democratic finance! Everyone should be able to invest according to their values!"

"Okay so is your company values-agnostic? Like, what if someone wants to invest in gunsmiths and oil companies?"

"We don't see any reason why anyone needs to own those."

...right.
2093 2018-08-08 20:03:06 And the conservative plan is...?

"Attack Trudeau and...uh...liberals...are...like, bad, ok...and...oil...and stuff..."

Just stop Andrew, you're not ready.
2094 2018-08-08 20:02:57 We won’t be losing any sleep over it.  Massive oil reserves in Alberta.  Bye bye Saudi Oil
2095 2018-08-08 20:02:50 My mom taught me the olive oil thing when I was 13. Do I not sleep in that info?
2096 2018-08-08 20:02:43 Canada sits on the 3rd largest oil reserve in the world....

We’ll be fine 

Dumbass
2097 2018-08-08 20:02:41 The Canadian oil industry has unsurpassed standards. It's too bad that we can't apply the same standards when choosing our leaders.
2098 2018-08-08 20:02:37 Doing a costream on @WatchMixer will *NOT* equal growth for your stream. It is part of a larger package, but do not equate the to. Anyone promising growth from costreaming with them (esp when charging a FEE for that costream) is a snake oil salesman.
2099 2018-08-08 20:02:29 they have lifetime free oil changes 
2100 2018-08-08 20:02:29 I suspect that food prices are going to go up due to weather impacting crop and animal feed, just in time for a no deal #Brexit. All we need now is sanctions on Iran to impact global oil prices!
2101 2018-08-08 20:02:27 Oh shit, I had no idea you've got migraines, too. CBD oil has been my personal savior, but I'm sure you've already tried that. Let me know how the botox goes and please know my DM's are always open for moral support! FUCK MIGRAINES
2102 2018-08-08 20:02:25 Burnt myself at work, put some burn gel on it, now my hand smells like tea tree oil and I’m having flash backs to when my mom put that shit in my hair so I wouldn’t get head lice. Wild.
2103 2018-08-08 20:02:25 With good governance, by now South-South would have been the best part of Nigeria not Abuja or Lagos. They have received trillions of Naira oil revenues, 13% derivation etc. Yes there was oil spillage & both states & FG must be made to account for the poor state of ND region.
2104 2018-08-08 20:02:23 @bracketdan See you at Lucas Oil. I'll be the guy in the Santa Clara Vanguard shirt.
2105 2018-08-08 20:02:18 Bobby Motaung and spending money on players is like mixing water and oil together
2106 2018-08-08 20:02:13 Iran vows to continue oil exports despite Trump's threats @AJENews. Iran known 4 its bluster & threats. Won't work with Trump. He means what he says while offering an olive branch 4 talks. NOT weakness
2107 2018-08-08 20:02:00 It's definitely my "this is my going to battle face" oil portrait pose for my inevitable mansion
2108 2018-08-08 20:01:56 Yeah, a nice hair hack too for flakes is to brush a little oil of your choice into your edges before laying them. But it’s great, smells good, and definitely lasts. Tie your hair down for like 5 min for best results

2111 2018-08-08 20:01:49 Energy East was designed to export oil, not to supply eastern Canada refineries, which cannot handle heavy oil sands crude
2112 2018-08-08 20:01:43 vitamin E oil & it’s super cheap
2113 2018-08-08 20:01:40 wash your hair 1-2xs a week, after the 4th/5th maybe put some coconut oil to your roots & ends, after washing add some moroccan oil light or a coconut water leave in spray!  coconut is life
2114 2018-08-08 20:01:38 @ImaginationTVCo - Yeah this isn't retail, company is flat out lying about no dilution or conversions. BIG WEEK all right, for everyone except those who believed in you. Wow! Smh. OTC man full of liars and snake oil salesmen CEO's
2115 2018-08-08 20:01:35 I don’t think SA will survive when renewables take over the market

2118 2018-08-08 20:01:21 So Saudi Arabia cruisified a man today. We sell them weapons and buy their oil. Are you ok with this @MPRandyHoback @AndrewScheer @theJagmeetSingh @JustinTrudeau ?
2119 2018-08-08 20:01:19 #TSLA's success stands in opposition to the interests of the over $5T/yr oil industry.  It would be slightly easier to fight the country of Japan (<$5T).  Going private simply disarms many of the weapons that can be used against them.  It's just good strategy.
2120 2018-08-08 20:01:15 Me after a full hour of emotionally purging to my therapist:

“Anyway, CBD oil is the shit”

2130 2018-08-08 20:00:24 Just a guess but I imagine they don't appreciate the public ridicule. Again, is the goal to secure the Badawis release or to make a show of acting tough? If it's the latter, then carry through and start taking action ie ban Saudi oil from coming into Canda, stop Saudi flights.
2131 2018-08-08 20:00:12 Saudi oil is original.

2143 2018-08-08 19:59:08 Obama paid 150 billion dollars of our blocked money in the US banks in cash,via air to the Iranian regime. You don't need me to explain what that money was spent on. In the meantime EU is so hardly trying to keep Iranian regime because they are benefiting financially from our oil
2144 2018-08-08 19:59:04 oil as material cause of #plastics... very helpful.
2145 2018-08-08 19:58:51 Lol yup. But if it’s government oil, then it’s ok. Same with opiates, if the government if getting a cut, then it’s all good.

2149 2018-08-08 19:58:26 Great beer that one. @BeavertownBeer prefer neck oil and the stout thingy is pretty awsome as well
2150 2018-08-08 19:58:10 From Money Magazine

During his campaign, Trump said he had a net worth of $10 billion — but that claim was quickly debunked with reports reflecting his net worth was closer to around $3 billion or $4 billion.

Think u know more than Money or Forbes or u swallowed the snake oil?
2151 2018-08-08 19:58:07 Wow. You actually believe the things you state. Capitalism is colonialism? Oil is death? Hahaha. What a world we live in. You've got a funny lens. Thanks for the laughs. I showed your Tweet to a whole bunch of people and we all enjoyed the hilarity. So crazy lol
2152 2018-08-08 19:57:59 Hate to break it to you,Trump never had  a monopoly on being a snake oil salesman, this has been going on for quite some time now.
2153 2018-08-08 19:57:56 Diamonds, Gold, Oil well, freighter ships.. And oh, 5k Suya and Hollandia every match day
2154 2018-08-08 19:57:51 Nightly/daily: Several artisan facial oils that contain Vit E. Face only.
Makeup removal: Jojoba oil.
Foot Massage: Typically unrefined sesame oil.
Aromatherapy: Jojoba as a carrier oil.
2155 2018-08-08 19:57:51 Have you tried using tresemé conditioner, you leave it in for 30 minutes, let it dry, wet your hair again, comb it and let it dry naturally, then use olive oil, leave it overnight and wash it out with water. Do this twice every two weeks and it should help (:
2156 2018-08-08 19:57:37 So we have areas that are too dry, areas that are too flooded, and also the ability to send oil via a pipeline for thousands of miles......... Am I the only one seeing a solution here? #wtf
2157 2018-08-08 19:57:35 did not expect better from trump WH, but wtf brits?  The sooner the world is free of needing ME oil the better.  One more reason to support alt energy & Canadian oil.
2158 2018-08-08 19:57:30 if plastic straws are the hill you’re choosing to die on but you have nothing to say (or more importantly, DO) abt stopping pipeline construction or putting an end to the oil industry, then i think your crusade is abt as hollow as the lil stainless steel tube you’re sucking on :)
2159 2018-08-08 19:57:27 We have plenty of oil.

How much water do you have?
We own 80% of the world's supply of freshwater.
Good luck.
2160 2018-08-08 19:57:26 It’s time to change the oil on my car 
2161 2018-08-08 19:57:20 4 Chicken legs, 2 red peppers, 2 red onions, 2 sweet potatoes . Slice veg lengthways, spray with olive oil, rosemary/salt/pepper. 25 mins @180. Then shake smoked paprika over, 20mins more ...done. Whilst cooking, stir every now and then
2162 2018-08-08 19:57:14 He can sell... snake  oil?  Or have a bunch of slobbering plaid jacketed men sell access to it???? #TrumpEcoNOmics
2163 2018-08-08 19:57:07 We can for free evetything WITH THE SAME MONEY WE ARE USING FOR BOMBING 8 COUNTRIES, THE TAXES CRAZY TRUMP AND HIS GANG CUT TO THE TOP 1 TO 10%, THE CONTRACT TO YHE PRIVATE JAILS, AND THE MONEY WE ARE GIVING TO THE OIL INDUSTRY AND THE FARMACEUTICALS.
2164 2018-08-08 19:57:07 water in flint is undrinkable

ground water from the faucet catches fire near #fracking wells

oil extract spills contaminate drinking water and fisheries that millions of ppl rely on for food and income.

this all happened prior to 45

but i'm glad you are now paying attention
2165 2018-08-08 19:57:03 7 minute dinner: 
1. Eggs, garlic, grated parmesan or other cheese, a lil milk, salt and pepper, leek. Whisk in a bowl. 
2. Mushrooms and squash. Chop them up. 
3. Lightly fry mushroom and squash bits in olive oil. Add garlic, coriander, salt and pepper
4. Empty pan.Fry egg stuff
2166 2018-08-08 19:57:00 shouldn't that be snake oil?
2167 2018-08-08 19:56:47 Do you know how you will get the exact opposite of ANYFUCKINGTHING you want?

Keep voting Green and supporting the environment killing platform of the GOP, which also happens to support the Kremlin's wishes too(an oil based economy)

Ever think why they support you dingledicks?
2168 2018-08-08 19:56:44 Digital non oil, non grain, non carnivore, vegan cookie for you 
2169 2018-08-08 19:56:38 Thanks to people trying to block pipelines, we already do. Oh and for the same reasons the refineries in Montreal buy Saudi oil.
2170 2018-08-08 19:56:35 "Eric, are you really that bad about NY?"

Picture a liberal reacting to a Trump-supporting oil executive wielding a plastic straw
2171 2018-08-08 19:56:26 found venison dog food! only thing is it contains salmon oil so we'll see if Bandit has a reaction (his foster mom told me it made him itchy).
2172 2018-08-08 19:56:23 Or high-end restaurants doing it also with salt/garlic/butter/oil to taste richer and more flavourful. My orig comment was price does not always=quality with beer and buddy was coming off as a beer snob citing Stella as his example-a beer brewed with corn
2173 2018-08-08 19:56:07 I had ear trouble exactly like you I couldn’t hear a thing I used optex ear drops the one with olive oil in and it was gone in a couple of days maybe try that hope this helps  @AnnaSaccone love you videos btw makes my day watching them 
2174 2018-08-08 19:56:01 Once again you are selling SNAKE OIL.   This JUNK you are trying to pass off as medical insurance doesn't  cover half of the basics!!!
2175 2018-08-08 19:55:58 Canada has more proven oil than the US and the US is self sufficient with 9 times the population.

Someday someone will need water.
And we own 80% of it.
2176 2018-08-08 19:55:55 And what does eastern Canada do for oil.
2177 2018-08-08 19:55:46 Pompeo's an idiot, he'll understand that when Russia moves to the Euro and the Yuan selling oil and gas.
2178 2018-08-08 19:55:46 It’s time to ban all Foreign Oil imports into Quebec until KM & #EneryEast is completed. 
#cdnpoli #BuildKM #ableg #qcpoli #bcpoli
2179 2018-08-08 19:55:44 I do if it’s covered in oil and salt before it’s cooked 
2180 2018-08-08 19:55:35 This would be a great time for Canada to show some balls and make a serious push to eliminate conflicted imports on oil and push Canadian oil/infrastructure .
2181 2018-08-08 19:55:32 Putting myself into an essential oil induced slumber because my back wouldn’t let me rest last night. Goodnight.
2182 2018-08-08 19:55:31 Do you realize how stupid these events are? Until YOU address the Millions of tons of #BOMBS dropped, Governments blowing up millions of barrels of #oil, #Corporations who have #permits to #pollute. All is MOOT! Not to exclude the Depleted #Uranium and it's issues.
2183 2018-08-08 19:55:19 But not spent olive oil... it is indeed a much healthier fat source
2184 2018-08-08 19:55:17 Do either of you put much stock in the "debt bomb" theory of unconventional/shale oil?

(Thanks for being on Twitter, by the way. You're always amazing resources!)
2185 2018-08-08 19:55:11 something about making fries all day long in greasy nasty oil really just makes me hungry

for french fries....
2186 2018-08-08 19:55:09 @bbcr1 it's stainless so a little tricky, being as it's tough, bit of oil.. sharp rowting.. she'll be just dandy.
2187 2018-08-08 19:54:55 Anyways, it's obvious to everyone in the planet how the US is bullying Venezuela into a dictatorship to benefit both from its oil and to make an example out of it "see, here's evidence (that we fabricated) of how useless and dangerous socialism is, go team neoliberalism!"
2188 2018-08-08 19:54:52 I'm guessing the Saudis didn't get the memo. I wonder if the Saudis also contributed funds to help in trying to destroying our oil industry?
2189 2018-08-08 19:54:43 Got my oil changed today & the mechanic changed my radio station to some republican bull shit so now I have to find a new place to get my car serviced 
2190 2018-08-08 19:54:36 Great day at #CrackingtonHaven bodyboarding.  Now, get down oil, I need to jump back on #Enquest #Trading
2191 2018-08-08 19:54:28 Hmm
$2B per year is about what we import in oil from Saudi Arabia. You get to come out even.
2192 2018-08-08 19:54:26 Behind all. That oil didn’t load itself in a tanker.
2193 2018-08-08 19:54:10 I never said those things were easily obtainable. We haven't done it because we have been governed by people with other agendas. How do we afford the massive corporate tax breaks? Or the massive sums we throw at our military industrial complex? Or subsidies for oil companies?
2194 2018-08-08 19:53:56 Sad... I managed a child that was fed crude oil, mother's piss, cut with razor blades. All in an effort to stop convulsions.
He died later. I cried like a baby when he did
2195 2018-08-08 19:53:56 Global #oil demand is higher only 1.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. Whereas crude oil #price is up 100%
This is bullshit #Rigged #Gas #Business to make #PetroDollar owners richer
#Economy #Money #OPEC #Bank #Olja #Bränsle
2196 2018-08-08 19:53:51 Salt in pasta water making a difference is not really a matter of opinion. It does make a difference and you can easily prove it subjectively and emperically. Oil can prevent boil-overs to a degree but not really useful for anything else.
2197 2018-08-08 19:53:43 Olive oil to remove your eyelash extensions .... BURNS
2198 2018-08-08 19:53:25 Canada should sell its oil well below open pricing.
2199 2018-08-08 19:53:23 Time to check our oil. Scrimmage against TL Hanna.
2200 2018-08-08 19:53:21 why did @drmarkhyman say to eat it sparingly on an instagram post?? also watch when buying antipasti from shops....artichokes I bought are submerged in sunflower oil...yuk
2201 2018-08-08 19:53:17 Myn used to steal my tissue oil and my corn flakes
EY ngawazonda ooonke amavenda ezweni
2202 2018-08-08 19:53:17 All these sanctions against Iran and Russia are crazy, the result will be massive oil price increases and economic instability.
2203 2018-08-08 19:53:15 I am an Emergency and Disaster Manager I spent 20 yrs with EPA. I found the exact same thing as EPA moved towards its political peddling and cronyism and far away from science and fact.
Anyone with doubts, ask why response was not allowed to BP Oil Spill until the oil hit land
2204 2018-08-08 19:53:07 Oil in the Firth of Clyde? ;-)) Is talking about that not a breach of the official secrets act?
2205 2018-08-08 19:53:07 How do you expect Angus to get any oil out from tight shale? It's likened to the Bakken shale in North Dakota and requires horizontal drilling with stimulation. Should have invested your money elsewhere because production is not going to happen!
2206 2018-08-08 19:52:56 Fresh oil...Lord Jesus! TODAY...
2207 2018-08-08 19:52:48 Probably...I see nothing that convinces me to trust oil companies, governments, and everything else inbetween.
So for me, its easier to be cynical that waste time listening to a bunch of liars.
2208 2018-08-08 19:52:41 Roflmao. Oh gosh. I have never even bought solvent from amazon. Only oil paint mediums and Solvent-FREE Gel. Are they recommending Gamsol to you now?
2209 2018-08-08 19:52:32 NEED FISH OIL
2210 2018-08-08 19:52:25 Palo Santo & lime essential oil 
2211 2018-08-08 19:52:20 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
2212 2018-08-08 19:52:11 The entire world hates the house of Saud. Most may not speak it because they need oil. Us Canadians?We just don't care. When you start showing women respect, stop imprisoning bloggers and stop murdering people for bogus blasphemy charges then we will show respect. #KingdomofCunts
2213 2018-08-08 19:52:06 exonmobil working in Pakistan, foreign ministry issued a statement that they are hopeful about oil discovery. I didnt say in the video we found oil, plus I talk with referncs which you can find in description but some people I think watch video only to prove other person wrong!
2214 2018-08-08 19:52:05 Get you some tea tree oil from The Body Shop and use it as spot treatment at night. It’s magical. If your skin is sensitive mix it w a little water. If not, apply as is.Besides that, their charcoal mask is good for breakouts, as well as the “Aztec Secret Indian healing clay mask”
2215 2018-08-08 19:52:04 Braids and wild growth oil, all fall and winter come new years , i need too see some progress 
2216 2018-08-08 19:51:56 have you rented a couple oil consumptiones in the last week
2217 2018-08-08 19:51:53 Oil wayyy too hot
2218 2018-08-08 19:51:52 I thought changing the oil myself on the Nissan would be more difficult than on my Ford and i was delighted to find out i was wrong.
2219 2018-08-08 19:51:52 Unfortunately your euro frenemies blame Trump for the Iranians plight, they blame Trump for everything, not their need for oil from Iran.
2220 2018-08-08 19:51:48 One #Israel airstrike caused a huge fire in an oil factory. #Gaza #GazaUnderAttack
2221 2018-08-08 19:51:47 Not to mention the crazy dietary supplement industry whose snake oil he helps peddle
2222 2018-08-08 19:51:46 You linked KSA’s behaviour to needing "to have the infrastructure to get our ethical oil to market”, thus the importance of bringing up that KSA’s human rights violations don’t justify Indigenous rights violations (e.g. our unethical oil) here in Canada.
2223 2018-08-08 19:51:44 So who should we buy oil from since we don’t have a pipeline to the east of the country? USA, nope trade war...Venezuela, Iran, nope dictator. Russia, another no.
2224 2018-08-08 19:51:43 Avocado oil got my skin feelin like silky & supple. 
2225 2018-08-08 19:51:41 Their conclusion is regime change won't happen, and are probably right, but a recent GPF article shows a possible crack in the IRGC.

Sanctions won't affect Iraq/Iran oil swap, but that amounts to almost nothing. At the most 60,000 bpd.
2226 2018-08-08 19:51:41 What about those coal jobs, steel mills, farmers winning, etc..?  Took us out of TPP, climate control, Iran, no backup plans.  Trump is a  oil salesman, con, grifter, flim-flam artist... only successful at being a failed businessman.
2227 2018-08-08 19:51:24 The federal govt needs to ensure the Energy East pipeline to Saint John NB gets built ASAP. Quebec & Atlantic Canada need to get off Saudi oil.
2228 2018-08-08 19:51:12 Castor oil like every second day, and massage the area for about 10mins everyday. Then wash and condition the area after a week so it doesn't get too clogged by all that oil.
2229 2018-08-08 19:51:11 Bro biotin and beard oil ain’t working I’m finna give up and let God do his work lol
2230 2018-08-08 19:51:08 Have they threaten to stop shipping oil The East Coast
2231 2018-08-08 19:51:00 #NaturalGas $5
Why?
Because I say so
if those rich asshole owners of those super cargo ships like the one's Walmart commissioned years ago don't think enough of #God's World to stop using dirty oil and start using natural gas.
Oil should drop to $55.
and natural gas go up to $5
2232 2018-08-08 19:50:59 Self - importance, smugness, and stubborn pride destroy fellowship faster than anything else. Pride builds walls between people, humility builds bridges. Humility is the oil that smoothes and soothes relationships. That's way the Bible says, clothe yourselves with humility.
2233 2018-08-08 19:50:56 And by the way, you import more Saudi oil than the US does because of the war on Alberta oil sands.
2234 2018-08-08 19:50:54 Let’s define it as any oil on the skin that didn’t come from inside of it.
2235 2018-08-08 19:50:50 We don’t need their dirty conflict oil because we have more massive piles in the ground.  We own nothing to the kingdom.
2236 2018-08-08 19:50:47 just went to get an oil change. they recommended a new battery. i said, 'no, just oil change.' pick up my car. and my battery is dead.
coincidence?
2237 2018-08-08 19:50:41 The lies about Angolan fuel by our government is disgusting! Angolan fuel contains little amount of sulphur, water has a low density, easily separated and easily drilled. It is one of the finest crude oil in the world.
2238 2018-08-08 19:50:34 No matter how you slice your day
or dream of places far away
or try to set your world apart
You always end up where you start

A bunch of cells below the soil
Some plasma in a lake of oil
I don't think that when I depart
I'll be close to where I start
2239 2018-08-08 19:50:33 i don’t know why it makes everything taste better, even dipping bread in olive oil is great

2242 2018-08-08 19:50:25 We don't want to be forced to buy ETHANOL just to make Iowa money you corrupt SOB. I'll take American OIL over being forced to buy that bullshit to make Iowa money. Drain the corn swamp
2243 2018-08-08 19:49:56 We have much more domestic oil now thanks to fracking. The #RFS should be done away with, as should all other gov't mandates that prop up particular forms of energy. Also, government shouldn't prohibit e-15 from being sold year round. Just get out of the way.
2244 2018-08-08 19:49:56 Even a snake oil salesman has to file a tax return.  I’d like to see the @POTUS’s tax returns now.  #donaldtheliar #thepresidentisamonster and #congressiscomplicit

2247 2018-08-08 19:49:47 Respect to Saudi Arabia? For what...oil?
2248 2018-08-08 19:49:40 Peppermint oil!
2249 2018-08-08 19:49:32 Just got an oil change that’s good for 7,500 miles. Maybe this will keep me out of the service station for a little while longer. #foreverdriving 
2250 2018-08-08 19:49:27 Pizza Hut is garbage pizza with a half-inch of oil at the bottom of any pizza that isn't thin crust. 

All the national chains are bad, but only PH makes its crust so soggy with oil that it's nigh inedible.
2251 2018-08-08 19:49:25 Maybe putting oil on, walking for miles and sitting at the pool till 5 wasn’t a good idea. Chest and arms on fire 
2252 2018-08-08 19:49:25 What can I say... how unfortunate that so much oil, money and power rained in the hands of primitive criminals (or were they handed power for their effectiveness in controlling territory and keep the colonial business going?) Imagine oil was found in Sicily...
2253 2018-08-08 19:49:18 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
2254 2018-08-08 19:49:15 A lot of places are using a filtering system to clean the grease oil through a machine and then it spits all the good oil back into the fryers and what not. Basically recycles oil, saw it first hand and it was pretty neat
2255 2018-08-08 19:48:49 Hmmm I want to start small waala where do i start from  wait oo why is  @SirLeoBDasilva putting more oil to  burning Yoruba man I hail deeee
2256 2018-08-08 19:48:45 Via WaPo: Trump admin to impose new sanctions on Russia for nerve agent attack in England in March

(Aside - this is more #TrumpRussia WWE-type ruse and/or we should expect higher crude oil prices (Trump's dumb Iran move) as higher oil enrichs #Russia & nullifies any sanctions)
2257 2018-08-08 19:48:37 You keep going back to the palm vs backyard egg things as if Kalel fits either of those. She's the person off to the side kicking puppies compared to backyard eggs and palm oil. She's advocating for the purchase of leathers, silks, and animal products. She didn't say anything
2258 2018-08-08 19:48:31 According to PC MPP & Cabinet Minister, this is fake news. Yet another Toronto hater who says there are no problems in Toronto as a result of last night's torrential rain. Just keep on burning oil. Like Donald Trump, the PC haters think that global warming is also fake news.
2259 2018-08-08 19:48:30 When did he initiate the  planting campaign that the palm fruit is being used to produced the palm oil? 
How long does it take @MBuhari  variety to start yielding fruit?
2260 2018-08-08 19:48:30 No. But if I had any of the problems it helps with, I would try it.
As with CBD oil, it's not sold in Norway and is likely getting stopped in customs if privately imported.
I might try to import it in the future.
2261 2018-08-08 19:48:21 it’s one of our main exports, seafood and olive oil, the greeks cook with both = elite combo, olive oil>> american grease oil shit
2262 2018-08-08 19:48:21 Canada imports oil, not gas, from Saudi Arabia. It’s about 10% of our crude imports.
2263 2018-08-08 19:48:15 It's always great when you make an oil change appt for 2pm and they roll it in the garage at 2:45 without even saying anything. Not like I've been waiting here in front of you the whole time. @precisiontune in Spring Lake Park, you're blowing it.
2264 2018-08-08 19:48:07 Pipelines needed...refineries so that we can use our own oil needed more!...:-)
2265 2018-08-08 19:48:04 Seconding mint! Peppermint tea, chewing gum, eating a mint, or even brushing my teeth always helps. I also have peppermint oil for my aroma diffuser and it helps a TON when I feel gross.
If I gotta eat, I usually make rice porridge or chicken noodle soup oooooor just toast.
2266 2018-08-08 19:48:02 When you say"lotion," did you mean for application on the body? Many people use oil (organic from supermarket) to apply to body (and lips too).
2267 2018-08-08 19:48:02 I ordered the honey from Apis Mercantile and the other stuff from Lazarus Naturals! LN has a “sample pack” of tincture, pills, and coconut oil so I got that
2268 2018-08-08 19:47:41 I couldn't agree more! Oil propped up Thatcher.  And is still propping Westminster up now.
2269 2018-08-08 19:47:35 I don’t think its naiive, if someone is applying to work on oil rig/ as a marine biologist in middle of no where, or essentially they are not in the public eye their social media is probably irrelevant unless they mention the company they work for

2272 2018-08-08 19:47:23 Saudi royalty are nothing but backassward red neck spiritually illiterate and reeking triballly defined testosterone infused 16th century throwbacks embalmed and blinded by crude oil.
2273 2018-08-08 19:47:14 Le ka caster oil a monate shame
2274 2018-08-08 19:47:03 Baked eggplant with fetta cheese and garlic and olive oil tastes delicious...
2275 2018-08-08 19:46:51 We have great energy speakers for this @ALEC_states annual meeting with representatives from the coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil, wind, and solar energy industries! We want to see all industries compete
2276 2018-08-08 19:46:48 I ain’t go get my oil change
2277 2018-08-08 19:46:48 Good luck with the Russia oil.. And u will end up being another one of Russia puppets.. And end up being depends om them like Germeny..
2278 2018-08-08 19:46:45 Yeah...when pigs fly. And as soon as the West stops its petro-addiction, KSA will go back to the thing it did for thousands of years before oil...namely goat herding.
2279 2018-08-08 19:46:26 We do need Oil imports until we can convince our politicians to build up our own energy sector, or atleast vote for the ones who will.
2280 2018-08-08 19:46:14 And how much for God who actually put the oil there ?
2281 2018-08-08 19:46:05 He doesn’t sell anything as useful as snake oil!  He sells division, hatred, & the loss of the nation I grew up in!  He’s despicable!
2282 2018-08-08 19:45:33 Apparently not! The houmous I like only has chick peas, oil, garlic, lemon juice, tahini and salt. But it’s somehow much better than I can achieve with the same ingredients
2283 2018-08-08 19:45:32 Every interview with these people should be prefaced with how much money they received from various entities.
Interview is about climate change: Sen Graham has taken whatever amount from the oil industry. And then proceed with the interview.
2284 2018-08-08 19:45:29 Lol it’s both sides. Here the liberals bought a oil pipeline that was being protested because it was being protested. Tax payers on the hook for 5 billion dollars and now the project sits and waits. It was the only way to kill the project without losing their voting base.
2285 2018-08-08 19:45:26 I think too much focus on data dependent management of oil market balance... and worries about LT investment in the sector is delaying this, but you’d never know. Could happen
2286 2018-08-08 19:45:23 You think Saudi Arabia will start a war because they lost their 11% market share of the Cdn oil market? I think that's a big stretch.
2287 2018-08-08 19:45:22 Canada’s GDP last year was nearly 3 times that of Saudi Arabia. Population of the two countries are nearly the same. Canada’s economy is diverse with resource. Without oil Saudi Arabia is nothing but a sandbox filled with cat sh!t
2288 2018-08-08 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2289 2018-08-08 19:45:11 How do you feel about preworkout? I'll drink Amino Energy and MCT oil and that puts me in the mood to workout. Or listening to "Coming Undone" by KoRn lol
2290 2018-08-08 19:45:06 MARITIMES VOTED 100% Liberal in

Current Liberal CANADA/SAUDI spat means No SAUDI Oil for MARITIMES

MARITIMES RELISHING WHAT THEY VOTED FOR !
2291 2018-08-08 19:44:56 I just bought a bunch of candles and massage oil I have a bath and body works addiction
2292 2018-08-08 19:44:51 Gee, it's poppy seed, ok, poppy seed oil? but when you bake the bagels doesn't that process destroy whatever little dope it left in those seeds.

She's lying.
2293 2018-08-08 19:44:38 Feminsim ends in a world run amock with spiders, cars in flames from no oil changes, and unopened jars of peanut butter.

Wall St. dips as oil slide drags down energy shares/Reuters
2295 2018-08-08 19:44:27 Thenjiwe fake CV,getting her an job already,at Maluju Oil she determined,Buhle in trouble with this #ImbewuTheSeed
2296 2018-08-08 19:44:25 Sadly I have no way for that..plus its not legal and I don't want to risk anything with my spawn. So I'll make do with CBD oil and booze.
2297 2018-08-08 19:44:20 Then you've never had to carry someone back-and-forth to work every single day..... They still get a pay check while you pay for all the gas and insurance & oil changes.... You gone pay me or the doctor one
2298 2018-08-08 19:44:04 spending your birthday money on getting an oil change and a car wash. is this being 23?
2299 2018-08-08 19:43:48 Use olive oil marinated tuna. Fucking game changer. 
2300 2018-08-08 19:43:43 Google Colorado Prop 97.  They want to change requirements for offsets on new oil drilling locations
2301 2018-08-08 19:43:40 No yard sales this weekend for me, got keyboard rigged up so it works 90% of time and got oil/gas stain out of pants/shirt.. It appears there's nothing that makes the hole come out in the wash
2302 2018-08-08 19:43:35 Either way you need to mix it up in the first place. Its like mayo, oil rises when sitting
2303 2018-08-08 19:43:29 It's a man! He'll probably some hair oil you a pencil, wound up in vain...
2304 2018-08-08 19:43:26 2/ The Conservatives might have balanced the budget in 2014, but they decided to tweak things so that they could have one in election year. The oil downturn interfered with that so they sold $3b+ in assets (GM shares) to "create" a $1.9b surplus. They inherited a $13.8b surplus.
2305 2018-08-08 19:43:09 Everything ends nothing more modest at a smoke and he's a joking around, oil
2306 2018-08-08 19:43:09 Oil pump maybe 
2307 2018-08-08 19:43:08 #nailedit  stop funding terror by no longer buying OPEC oil.
2308 2018-08-08 19:43:05 Like Scotland is running out of oil... All these Lords that have embraced and support relentlessly the Union of Nations... we don't believe you anymore! You only try to convince yourself and it's not working! #indiref2 won't be a lie and it will be soon
2309 2018-08-08 19:42:54 Yeah.  I'd say believing in science, even though it might not be good for the oil industry, is a good start.
2310 2018-08-08 19:42:48 Too much oil or too many frozen fries ?
2311 2018-08-08 19:42:39 It would be a good thing if the Liberal gov finally realized that developing the Canadian oil and gas industry and ensuing we have pipelines to get it to market - is a vital national interest.

Unfortunately, I doubt they'll make the connection.
2312 2018-08-08 19:42:30 And yet we still lived in poor conditions as all our money was spent in London and the South East even after striking oil we should have been rolling in it they neglected and abused Scotland
2313 2018-08-08 19:42:23 I am not buying that snake oil.
2314 2018-08-08 19:41:50 Saudi Arabia does have oil but it is past its peak and a war with Iran would destroy its only real asset. Canada by contrast has a lot of what Saudi Arabia needs, food. Russia's wheat production is way down and a major drought afflicts Australia. The large food producers are few.
2315 2018-08-08 19:41:01 Yeah, record job growth, booming stock market, low oil prices, coherent speeches, assault weapons ban, large drop in murder rates and relative peace and stability.  

It was a truly horrible time to be alive, I’m glad you survived it.
2316 2018-08-08 19:41:01 For the ever on going impulse to prove their snake oil value, every year some nincompoop HR genius convinces some completely out of touch CEO to go down a rabbit hole to a dead end that will have zero or backward results but have employees jumping through obstacles wasting time.
2317 2018-08-08 19:40:57 70 naira for 1? Are they mad? Did they fry it with Pope blessed anointing oil ?
2318 2018-08-08 19:40:47 Infowars fish oil is the only fish oil made 100% from those amphibian reptilians in that shape of water movie.
2319 2018-08-08 19:40:47 If state reprisals start spiraling into large swathes of the Chinese economy, people might be surprised how quickly China's economic path can divert from "South Korea, but bigger" to "Venezuela, but without oil."
2320 2018-08-08 19:40:36 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "GoPro: Jessy Nelson Moto 1 - Glen Helen MX Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship 2015" à l'adresse

2322 2018-08-08 19:40:31 A dishonest/crooked Snake oil salesman
2323 2018-08-08 19:40:25 i think the greatest tragedy of peanut allergies is that they cant have fried food in peanut oil
2324 2018-08-08 19:40:24 Very easy to do actually, I made my first lot about 2 years ago with just beeswax but found a different recipe that used pine rosin and jojoba oil too this time and they are so good! X
2325 2018-08-08 19:40:22 Continuing the attack by authoritarian governments on democracies. How about we accelerate our transition from oil to clean energy and leave these barbarians holding their polluted bag.
2326 2018-08-08 19:40:20 Now is the time to build a cross Canada pipeline and rid ourselves of Saudi oil which comes in from eastern USA pipeline.
2327 2018-08-08 19:40:14 I'm literally looking forward to glucosamine and fish oil everyday lmao.
2328 2018-08-08 19:40:13 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
2329 2018-08-08 19:40:09 Saudi Arabia is a dictature and exports radical islamism everywhere, every country in the west should follow Canada's example, we should buy our oil elsewhere
2330 2018-08-08 19:40:09 Family Nutrition: #Kraft Italian Dressing this August? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
2331 2018-08-08 19:40:02 US crude drops 3.2% to 7-week low, settling at $66.94, as US-China trade dispute heats up

-China reports July crude oil imports showing shipments are at the third-lowest level this year.
-U.S. crude fell by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Administration.
2332 2018-08-08 19:40:00 Theyre so subservient to US interests that all they can do is try to mimic the style of whatever US president holds their leesh. Under Bush, Crown Prince Abdullah was a straight talking oil man, and now MBS is doing his best to imitate Trump's game show host with an iron fist
2333 2018-08-08 19:39:37 When do you anticipate reaching 100%? Why not today?? You don’t HAVE to use ANY unsustainably sourced oil. You don’t have to engage in any environmental or human rights abuses, anywhere, ever. Please be responsible humans.
2334 2018-08-08 19:39:35 My husband has used it to make popcorn.  Substitutes popcorn oil with the bacon grease.
2335 2018-08-08 19:39:31 Who is this mysterious "we" for whom you purport to speak? BTW, you just reminded me- Russia's another country that would like to sell us oil. So is Kazakhstan.
2336 2018-08-08 19:39:30 For hot oil to possibly splash on my bare skin? I think not.

2339 2018-08-08 19:38:58 who is saying it's going fine in venezuela? the prob there are the oil reserves, trying to spread the wealth from those reserves has caused massive political issues
2340 2018-08-08 19:38:58 Harper added 160$ billion to Candas debt and nothing to show for it. Oil pipelines will actually make Alberta money. A shame u r too thick to understand that #alberta #cdnpoli
2341 2018-08-08 19:38:33 Have you tried making nut bars? Coconut oil/butter and a bunch of nuts basically. So good.
2342 2018-08-08 19:38:33 That went fast all ready the science is settled argument and the big oil money argument.  I need Unprecedented for my alarmists word bingo.
2343 2018-08-08 19:38:27 Al que está opinando en cualquier lado por cosas que no tienen idea, vengan ayudarme a empujar la combi que me quedé sin gas oil con 20 personas arriba.
2344 2018-08-08 19:38:26 It is quite good that wind and sun can compete with coal/oil/gas, but at the current price level of fossils it is not possible to have a business case for H2 (and other storage options) if the CO2 release is not linked to a fee.
2345 2018-08-08 19:38:23 We sell our oil to the US you ass, we can stop the flow.
2346 2018-08-08 19:38:19 Normal person: yea just heat it up on the stove
Gordon Ramsey: heat,on. Olive oil on low, let it sizzle. Delicately place food on the pan and swirl it counterclockwise for 90 seconds. The aroma of that leftover spaghetti, absolutely breathtaking
2347 2018-08-08 19:38:11 Cbd oil is the answer!
2348 2018-08-08 19:38:06 Colonization crimes via Israel in Palestine & Saudis in turn being in Yemen is not right either. No double standards. Real eyes see the strategic point Yemen plays re pipelines & oil/gas flow between nations. I amicably suggest solar energy to replace oil/gas/pipelines & stop war
2349 2018-08-08 19:37:56 every time the guys changing my oil start my car i hear a loud “YEEEEWWWWWW” immediately after lmao
2350 2018-08-08 19:37:45 I use coconut oil on the scalp and a fine tooth comb and gently went over my whole scalp exfoliating the dry patches while allowing the flakes to rest in my hair and just focused on exfoliating.Then I washed my hair with a mint tea tree oil shampoo twice and deep conditioner.
2351 2018-08-08 19:37:44 Pompeo's an idiot, he'll understand that when Russia moves to the Euro and the Yuan selling oil and gas.
2352 2018-08-08 19:37:43 Thankfully I've already got that sorted. Still doesn't seem very cost-effective, but maybe if I load it up with oil instead..
2353 2018-08-08 19:37:39 I don't need one, for God is my protection. But how come your GOs who sell oil and handkerchief to you as protection ride in bullet proof cars and with body guards for the fear of death? Don't you have sense? Get small abeg
2354 2018-08-08 19:37:21 Embrace wisdom not the seductress. It is impossible to embrace both wisdom and the seductress. Wisdom and the seductress are like oil and water, they don't mix. They are like hot and cold, you cannot get them together.
2355 2018-08-08 19:37:09 @DouglasCarswell try removing all the subsidies for oil/gas/coal and see where that gets you in a free market.
2356 2018-08-08 19:37:08 Colonialism is the most convenient excuse for an Africa that doesn't want to take responsibility.The mzungu did a railway line from Mombasa to Eldoret and up to Kitale.100 yrs later we transport oil from Turkana,past Kitale, Eldoret,Nairobi to Mombasa on a traffic clogged road.
2357 2018-08-08 19:37:08 I would much rather be omw to Lucas Oil to see my best friend than sitting alone in my living room stressing about college applications @_melissa_e_ @DCI
2358 2018-08-08 19:37:05 oh ur at a cafe ? here’s our only salad: it’s arugula and sliced apple and crumbled goat cheese tossed in olive oil :) bet u haven’t had that before
2359 2018-08-08 19:37:02 So jealous u and the CPC arent moving Albertas oil out, Harper had 10 years and couldnt, but Justin is. Suck on that . #cdnpoli
2360 2018-08-08 19:36:58 $oil just shattered my plan today down  4%, Damn! Still Bullish, long! $cei down to .28, $chke  .76 $gbr 2.5 $jone .45....
2361 2018-08-08 19:36:54 do robots sweat oil?
2362 2018-08-08 19:36:48 I think CAD is poised to rally into the fall. A big sell-off probably starts late this year that takes CADUSD to perhaps .50 in 2019 when oil & the global economy really get hit. Rally first though.
2363 2018-08-08 19:36:27 Right??? It's a privilege to be able to afford someone to do the cleaning, and I do NOT take that for granted. But also, this shit's fantastic, and it shouldn't be such a shameful topic. I could change my own oil, too, but I'd rather pay someone to do it for me.
2364 2018-08-08 19:36:25 And hey, Green Party: Which party do you think will be positioned to put your green agenda into place? The Greedy Oil Plutarchs, or the Democrats who at least BELIEVE IN SCIENCE?  Greens: VOTE BLUE TO STAY GREEN
#GreensVoteBlue !
2365 2018-08-08 19:36:23 Only thing black is oil! U folks not gifted! Academics of engineering science degree vs immigration law! i American i female! So this is (“Illinois Female Chamber of Commerce Convention!®©outlaws frauds’ name things not Americans that error. We R Evolved they r not valid.
2366 2018-08-08 19:36:13 The more we wean off the oil of any of those countries the better. Energy sustainability and self sufficiency should be paramount to any country’s defence.
2367 2018-08-08 19:35:33 Octopus BBQ (with good quality olive oil, origano and lemon dressing) another of my favourites. Mop up the juices with warm cypriot bread

2369 2018-08-08 19:35:21 With Sanctions in place with Iran, we wanted to also box in Russia, therefore Saudi needed to increase production. Bam, now we all need Saudi oil more.. And now you guys really want to pull out, your cost of gas will double..
2370 2018-08-08 19:35:20 Guys le fryer mae ka fish oil? Sis man.
2371 2018-08-08 19:35:18 Only that no one is mentioning that frozen milk whilst in plastic bottles during the defrosting process, is absorbing petroleum chemicals. (Plastic derives from the oil industry.) Milk is fat soluble & should never be frozen then defrosted whilst in in #plastic! #LiveWellFoLonger
2372 2018-08-08 19:35:06 Just let them deal with the oil burns  they’ll learn
2373 2018-08-08 19:35:00 50$ oil change I’m crying
2374 2018-08-08 19:34:57 My daughter baked a cake with the anointing (olive) oil!  these folks gonna get saved! But it’s good tho!
2375 2018-08-08 19:34:48 What about changing the oil on the IS300 tho 
2376 2018-08-08 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
2377 2018-08-08 19:34:21 Girl.. starbucks lol Andrew makes his the night before with mct oil and everything. (Cold coffee of course)
2378 2018-08-08 19:34:17 It's broader than that...cliff notes is everyone was happy at the rousing success that was the OIR counter-oil campaign (I'd argue that success was overblown from a strategic perspective although I dont dispute we significantly disrupted their oil producing capability)...
2379 2018-08-08 19:34:14 Dakle tea tree oil na ujed od komarca, nema na čemu
2380 2018-08-08 19:34:10 You do realise that oil is priced in dollars. A large fall in the pound means a large increase in petrol/diesel prices with all the knock on effects.
2381 2018-08-08 19:33:49 FOS is an oil funded lobby front. They really hate when facts destroy their well-founded strategy of deception
2382 2018-08-08 19:33:34 The less of Canada the Saudi oil ticks own the better.
2383 2018-08-08 19:33:33 This isn’t a war. Saudi Arabia is just whining. They’ll calm down when oil prices go up.
2384 2018-08-08 19:33:27 Shouldn't we be calling out institutions like this for contributing to climate change and pollution as we do with oil/car companies?
2385 2018-08-08 19:33:23 I just gave myself a hot oil treatment and baby listen! My hair is flourishing !
2386 2018-08-08 19:33:23 that black castor oil & flaxseed eco doesn’t slick a damn thing
2387 2018-08-08 19:33:11 Yes I have, and again your prices will go up even more without Saudi oil. The reason Saudi had to increase production above OPEC recommendations was do to the crude oil prices, what do u think willl happen to your cost once Saudi pulls out of your economy. Think..
2388 2018-08-08 19:33:04 If you lived in Iraq when Blair was prime minister you Must've feared being blown up or shot , oil thief liar
2389 2018-08-08 19:33:00 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
2390 2018-08-08 19:32:57 Germany getting oil from Russia no different than Europe doing business with Iran. Both are potential enemies!
Either support NATO or get out!
#usa
2391 2018-08-08 19:32:46 I love how every single parking spot at the auto part store has a giant oil stain.
2392 2018-08-08 19:32:44 These wars are not in the interests of citizens, theyre in the interests of bankers, big oil/gas oligarchs, arms corporations and foreign interests controlling their monetary supply & policies at home & abroad. Saudis;your prince being exploited by trump/ross in their trade war.
2393 2018-08-08 19:32:42 My baby got 2 new tires & an oil change
2394 2018-08-08 19:32:41 Not sure the British specifically set out to "invade Jerusalem".
More likely to have been to stop Ottoman Empire from threatening oil supplies to Britain during WW1.  (Ottoman Empire was on the side of Germany in WW1).
2395 2018-08-08 19:32:39 Where will I get coconut oil in katsina?
2396 2018-08-08 19:32:34 8/ How’s the plan to destroy ISIS?  Are the troops home from Afghanistan yet? Are we committing major human rights violations in an illegal war in Yemen, while helping Saudi Arabia because he’s personally beholden to the oil industry?
2397 2018-08-08 19:32:32 What are they like straight onto previously oil based gloss surface
2398 2018-08-08 19:32:27 Oil & gas management , any opportunity to showcase intelligence 
2399 2018-08-08 19:32:23 Which polyunsaturated fatty acids are contained in fish oil?
2400 2018-08-08 19:32:22 I agree...The Libs didn't want the pipeline in Canada in the first place.  We could be facing an oil shortage in Canada...but JT will be happy....Environment issues.....
2401 2018-08-08 19:32:18 We don't. Private industry buys oil. They are the ones with the moral failings.
2402 2018-08-08 19:32:16 Controversial food opinions:
I sometime enjoy cutting meat WITH the grain
Sometimes overcooked and mushy pasta is delicious
Salt or oil in pasta water doesn't matter
Searing doesn't "seal in the juices" and american cheese is amazing (ht @kenjilopezalt)

Come @ me
2403 2018-08-08 19:31:41 We pump three times more oil than Iran does and can pump twice as much as we are right now so let them think they have a good hand in this card game.
2404 2018-08-08 19:31:39 Why is it some LPs say 10ml of Oil = 1 gram of dried flower and others say 4ml = 1 gram? It affects prescription allowances #cannabis
2405 2018-08-08 19:31:37 And I wud love to rub oil on yu Dolly whilst u rubbing oil on ristina, thats stuff dreams are made of xxx
2406 2018-08-08 19:31:32 Snake oil would be an upgrade from what we're getting.
2407 2018-08-08 19:31:20 Also each Kw power saved by oil refinery is equal to a far greater mileage if that same kW is sent down cable at supersonic speed and cut direct into an EV. Efficiency of power transferral is massively higher in an EV over burning fuel in an ICE
2408 2018-08-08 19:31:17 Adding to all of your well-deserved accolades, iceberg has the benefit of being includable as chunks in a salad, thus making it easy to stab with a fork.  My favorite dressing is apple vinegar, olive oil, salt & pepper and a dash of sugar.
2409 2018-08-08 19:31:03 The world's largest oil producer has imposed sanctions on its 3rd and 5th largest producers, and has started a trade war with its 7th largest producer . Meanwhile, the world's 2nd largest producer has initiated an all-out economic embargo on its 4th largest producer. #geopolitics
2410 2018-08-08 19:31:03 @drgundry Your black coffee tweet suggested adding coconut milk.  We've been adding MCT oil and butter, but we need to change. Would coconut cream be a closer match for the butter?

2422 2018-08-08 19:29:43 PIAC reports always touch on misappropriation of funds for projects.... that is why I keep saying pump all the oil money into education...
2423 2018-08-08 19:29:32 Yesterday at the grocery store I was behind this mom and her 5/6ish year old child in the checkout when he suddenly turned to his mom in full panic mode and goes “MOM! DID YOU REMEMBER OLIVE’S OIL?” And it honestly wasn’t that funny but I’m still laughing about it
2424 2018-08-08 19:29:28 Sure could use a pipeline east right now so we could tell the Saudis where to shove there oil. Thanks for stopping that @DenisCoderre. Really appreciate your help with that.
2425 2018-08-08 19:29:25 If that’s what it took to rid ourselves of SA oil, then yes. Double is a ridiculous example though.
2426 2018-08-08 19:29:18 US puts Saudi Arabia on equal footing with Canada.    Says they're both allies.

Maybe @statedeptspox can start getting their oil from the dictatorship of Saudi Arabia from now on, and no new #NAFTA for you.

Oh and we should pull our troops from Latvia, Iraq & Ukraine. #cdnpoli

2428 2018-08-08 19:29:14 I got my oil changed and my tire pressure checked this morning. You can only imagine how pissed i was when i tried leaving my house a little bit ago and one of my tires was completely flat. 
2429 2018-08-08 19:29:05 Enjoyment girl! But you can have 50% of all those things na. It shouldn't be hard to shave your legs, get baby oil and locate a pool. Getaway, ocean and your king that he can make happen.  or is it his legs you want shaved? 
2430 2018-08-08 19:28:56 Then one of those California wildfires hit that fracking site, all hell breaks loose because of the systematic destruction of open space of this contemptible administration. 
Theyre all getting kick backs from the oil industry. This administration is an abomination
2431 2018-08-08 19:28:46 i guess im going to get an oil change today RIP i have to get gas and groceries too so i might as well go
2432 2018-08-08 19:28:45 FOTD: While we may all despise having to get our oil changed every few months, proper regular maintenance can help you avoid costly repairs down the road. Let us help with your vehicles maintenance by giving us a call and booking your oil change now (with free inspection)!
2433 2018-08-08 19:28:43 Censorship is censorship. I don't like everything he says, either, but he's the one who blew the lid off of the Bohemian Grove and exposed deep state façades. Sure, he's also quite the snake oil charlatan, but he's not a public threat
2434 2018-08-08 19:28:18 the government should take this opportunity to finally be an advocate for Canadian oil. Stop imports of Saudi/OPEC Oil and get pipelines built east/west to become not dependent on non ethical oil.
2435 2018-08-08 19:28:16 Hahahaha. You think the Conservatives would support Saudi Arabia more than Trudeau? The Conservative leader campaigned against foreign Oil. And many Canadian conservatives aren’t exactly fans of Islam in general. Good luck. All of Canada stands together against the Saudis.
2436 2018-08-08 19:28:12 Chief trust me when I say she is not the girl I want I mean it we are like oil and water

2440 2018-08-08 19:27:11 How did i forget to buy oil 
2441 2018-08-08 19:27:05 It’s an Igbo soup mainly from Anambra people it’s called white soup because there’s no palm oil and pounded yam is used to thicken it

2444 2018-08-08 19:26:57 It's called "getting some decent candidates".

Hillary supports fracking & voted for oil drilling. Obama likewise supported fracking(& you know killing 13 civilians for every one combatant in the Middle East)
2445 2018-08-08 19:26:51 It would be laughable, if in the disclosure, the Alarmists would find out that their dear Green Energy are all built by  oil Companies & explaining why they keep making lots of money.

2448 2018-08-08 19:26:24 So what *did* happen to that North Sea oil wealth?

2450 2018-08-08 19:26:20 Well Danielle Smith has no credibility... so? 

Maybe someone should inform her that Energy East was an EXPORT pipeline that was proposed before the shale oil boom and when oil was $120 a barrel

It is no longer economical to ship bitumen 5000kms to a coast where no one wants it.
2451 2018-08-08 19:26:20 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil

2453 2018-08-08 19:26:14 Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface.

2455 2018-08-08 19:26:09 If only there was a way to become more self reliant in respect to our natural resources, and had a way to get our ab/sk oil to the refineries in the east.......
2456 2018-08-08 19:26:06 we need to cut off Saudi oil. Build pipelines. Export like crazy
2457 2018-08-08 19:26:04 Get rich on the back of someone else's talent,Mike Oldfield,then spend the rest of your life as a snake oil salesman..
2458 2018-08-08 19:26:03 Stress Away essential oil roll on. A bit on the wrists, stop to take some deep smells. Make it a habit and it’s a quick way to stop and Center yourself. Though I never smoked...
2459 2018-08-08 19:25:53 Saudi is producing about 10m barrels daily with a population of less than 30m while nigeria is “SAID” to be producing 2m barrels per day with a population of almost 200m. The oil no too dey like that.
2460 2018-08-08 19:25:53 So we can replace their oil, students, patients. What's not to love about telling the Saudis where to put their human rights violations?
2461 2018-08-08 19:25:52 I think we should give the prez a nick name.  How does Snake Oil Don sound?  Great to me and truthful.

2472 2018-08-08 19:24:28 So the military is used to go into these areas and take metals and oil from countries? We have those resources in America
2473 2018-08-08 19:24:26 A day in the life of working at a pizzeria: hot sauce on ur face, chicken wing blood running down my leg, hot oil popping at you and sweaty as fuck
2474 2018-08-08 19:24:16 No. You said about how we can't retrieve oil without it costing us money.   The pdf from BP proves otherwise.   They are an actual profit making company,  do you honestly think they'd sell off another revenue if nothing was there.

2499 2018-08-08 19:21:03 You can bet the Saudis wouldn’t have done this if Trump didn’t piss on Trudeau first. Saudi oil vs. Tar Sands is all the Republicans are thinking, and you know who wins that one.
2500 2018-08-08 19:20:59 If you have Doterra’s “deep blue” oil rub that on it! Or put it in the bath. Not sure if it really works in the long run but it deff soothes pain for the time being
2501 2018-08-08 19:20:57 Pompeo's an idiot, he'll understand that when Russia moves to the Euro and the Yuan selling oil and gas.

2503 2018-08-08 19:20:47 Ah yes way of life and security is a personal UnitedStates issue because our values don't matter to other countries. Not that we meant too but out PRES is kinda wild. Bu resources like oil and produce from central and South America on top of the metals coming from Africa etc..
2504 2018-08-08 19:20:43 We can replace it with TRAINS ... because the prairie farmers aren't already having enough trouble getting their grain to coastal waters, and unlike Oil, rail is their only option.  Oh well, most of them are in SASK and what does Trudeau care about them.
2505 2018-08-08 19:20:37 Thou anointest my head with oil
2506 2018-08-08 19:20:31 I'm proposing that we actually get our vast oil and gas reserves to market and stop blowing money on discounted thermostats and carbon cheques. Either we do that or you're right, we will have much higher taxes and get less in services.

2515 2018-08-08 19:19:16 That is to say it went from 44% of 5523 Mtoe (2430 Mtoe) to 32% of 13761 Mtoe (4404 Mtoe), or an increase in oil demand of 81% over that period.  The increase in share from other sources is welcome, but until the size of the pie starts to decrease, sadly impact will be limited.
2516 2018-08-08 19:19:13 It's called Cannabis Oil (aka CBD Oil) only because it is made from hemp. Some strIns of CBD Oil do have low concentrations of THC but most do not. He is NOT on Cannabis or Weed as per his drug testing! People really need to learn the facts!

2535 2018-08-08 19:17:51 No deal, I will never stand by when cowards subjugate women. You have show your lack of manhood. Thank God the electric car era is upon us, Oil will go the way of coal in a decade, so save up what you make now off of it.
2536 2018-08-08 19:17:45 There’s a few that do the same to me, in addition to that one. ‘Self-generated income,’ ‘Oil money,’ ‘Empty seats,’ ‘FFP.’
2537 2018-08-08 19:17:42 His tweet is relevant because of the roll the woman played. U would think someone who supports zanu like that is living pretty coz of zanu. It becomes tweeter worthy wen she z found hiding cooking oil under her skirt in a supermarket. Understand the context mdara
2538 2018-08-08 19:17:40 Weekly Technical Perspective on Crude Oil Prices (WTI)Crude oil is down more than 10% off the July high with price now approaching long-term uptrend support. Here are the key price levels that matter on the WTI weekly cha...
2539 2018-08-08 19:17:40 Oil has topped out & is likely headed for mid 50s. Ultimately I expect oil to fall to $10 in next year's global deflationary bust. Would avoid energy stocks. Semis, FAANG, healthcare, miners & industrials likely to be leading performers as S&P makes final run to 3300 by this fall
2540 2018-08-08 19:17:34 I know it is difficult to comprehend but Saudi Arabia is not the centre of the universe.  We don’t need their dirty oil and dirty politics.

2543 2018-08-08 19:17:19 The worst thing about this heat is definitely the effect it is having upon my 'now mostly oil at the top' jar of peanut butter.
2544 2018-08-08 19:17:19 I’m on a no oil, very low salt diet due to blocked arteries. But that looks like a pretty tasty dressing. I usually go with a Forks Over Knives recipe that’s similar. I’d definitely go with your dressing over mine, if I could.
2545 2018-08-08 19:17:18 I have had enough of the doing for a minute. I will do again shortly. I adulted and got my oil changed.
2546 2018-08-08 19:17:15 LOL how about greater focus on lobbying in general. The NRA’s total contributions over the last 20 years is not even close to the amount contributed annually by lobbyists for big pharma, big oil, Comcast, and many other questionable interests that are more detrimental to society.
2547 2018-08-08 19:17:12 Those who would give up essential , to purchase a little temporary Bowl, deserve neither Mustard oil nor Panama.
2548 2018-08-08 19:17:06 steakhouse fries or whatever, they're like 120kcal per 100g and you can air fry them without any oil at all since they already have some oil on them and you eat the same tasty fries for 120kcal per 100g instead of 300-350kcal per 100g with regular fryer

2550 2018-08-08 19:17:00 Any Islamic country that is considered to be developed is coz of its oil reservoir. This shit thinking is killing them n others too..such people are disease in the society.
2551 2018-08-08 19:16:53 Premium CBD oil from Colorado (@bluebirdhemp to be exact.)

Somebody looking simply at the cost ($400-ish/month) would say I was crazy, but CBD took my productivity to such a different level that its ROI is almost too high to calculate.

No shame about spending on that 
2552 2018-08-08 19:16:39 What are you pushing for? 

Health care for who can afford it, dollar or two extra, unlimited military spending, and a continuation of an oil based economy? 

I know when you are a rich white lawyer none of those things are important to you, but it's critical to the rest of us
2553 2018-08-08 19:16:37 I just got a oil change for 11. Bucks
2554 2018-08-08 19:16:37 Yep he is a snake oil salesman... with a twist.  He is also the snake that secretes the oil.
2555 2018-08-08 19:16:32 I used Blond Brilliance it’s not harsh and coated my hair in coconut oil before!
2556 2018-08-08 19:16:28 Coconut oil
2557 2018-08-08 19:16:26 A2: #makershour That's like choosing among your children! I might say oil paint as an all-time favorite, but the toxicity and mess leave a lot to be desired.
2558 2018-08-08 19:16:22 Easy answer: blockchain is a fad. Period. There may be blockchain currency in the future, or not. Everything else is snake oil.
2559 2018-08-08 19:16:17 Greatest snake oil salesman ever. POTUS
2560 2018-08-08 19:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2561 2018-08-08 19:16:09 All Iran has to do is buy some nukes from the DPRK & pay w/oil they sorely need.  It will guarantee no US invasion or Israeli attack.  Nice art of the deal, Trump!
2562 2018-08-08 19:16:08 Advocacy tip: use analogies to help your leadership/board members understand your work. LSU Foundation used an oil/gas analogy. #ApraPD2018
2563 2018-08-08 19:15:59 I'm actually deeply excited that the world gets a reminder of the fact that Saudi Arabia has a terrible human rights record on women and LBGTQ of whom they literally execute in a square from crane. They flooded the market with oil to hurt industry in north america... not friendly
2564 2018-08-08 19:15:59 Anybody have a human sized deep fryer? I'll buy the oil to fill it.
2565 2018-08-08 19:15:52 ‘Sotally Tober’ the latest Impossimal collection will be released this September, until then have fun tracking down these available oil sketches that have hit the galleries today! #impossimals
2566 2018-08-08 19:15:47 Maybe we should trade repressive regimes and buy our 10% oil from Venezuela.
2567 2018-08-08 19:15:46 I haven't found one person that could tell me who would benefit from this so called hoax. The only people benefiting from lies are oil companies convincing everyone that climate change is a hoax.
2568 2018-08-08 19:15:33 11% Saudi Oil was only because Arabs tend to sulk froth at the mouth when they don't get their way. #ChangeMyMind
2569 2018-08-08 19:15:27 They drink oil in alhilal 
2570 2018-08-08 19:15:21 Only 12 yr olds would think anyone could get oil for free. Already married, but thanks.

2573 2018-08-08 19:15:04 #ANGS was there ever any doubt . Now the re-rate will begin as we get ideas around the timelines for flow testing. This news has just cemented the current share price now time for the growth to unfold over next few weeks. I still hold for higher levels. #OIL #GAS
2574 2018-08-08 19:15:00 *Venezuela wants customers I hear. They seem to have some extra oil.
2575 2018-08-08 19:14:56 @realDonaldTrump We and President Trump emphasize that no currency should enter Iran, and until November 4, Iran's oil exports should reach zero. This stance will never change at any cost.
2576 2018-08-08 19:14:32 Also coconut oil and some of those other oils do the complete opposite. I know for me it dries me out both skin and hair. My body just doesn’t like it.
2577 2018-08-08 19:14:21 Don't be deceived by the mammoth crowd at Ikot Ekpene. Three things tend to dictate the narrative of #AkwaIbom- Oil money, the civil service and partisan politics. 
The same crowd will host Gov Emmanuel Udom, anyday anytime

2580 2018-08-08 19:13:48 What's the difference between perfume and perfume oil??
2581 2018-08-08 19:13:40 If you can, get Avon "Skin so Soft" dry oil spray. It stops the buggers biting! Troops in Afghanistan use it - my brother gave me some as I'm a restaurant for any bug going. I haven't been bitten since i started using it! Honestly! Avon site or Amazon! X
2582 2018-08-08 19:13:39 Yes regular olive oil.
2583 2018-08-08 19:13:39 Really bad, oil and stuff?! Ooooo! And these tariffs are working? He's done for
2584 2018-08-08 19:13:32 @WHO @NATO @USCENT if I make something I am killed for why the food that oil buy the king of saudie arabia to get my car out I got my degree in the irrigation system second part goes in first to middle east to have food for my car to end pollution in mean to help so I will him.
2585 2018-08-08 19:13:26 Well that was a kerfuffle.

Also, why do you have a jar of coconut oil out and why is it so common for you to have it out that you've been warned about leaving it open?
2586 2018-08-08 19:13:23 Why, don’t these Surrey campaigners use oil?
2587 2018-08-08 19:13:21 Arent all wars are started from oil?... not sure we want to take that leap.
2588 2018-08-08 19:13:17 Do y'all ever get a rush from doing "adult things". I just scheduled an oil change/tire rotation and feel like doing cartwheels
2589 2018-08-08 19:13:16 @OilsandsAction @transcanada #cdnpoli  Hey Quebec and the maritimes, I know a place from where you can get oil with Cdn values.  You need only seek Cdn energy and allow us to ship it to you, rather than you shipping $Cdn to foreign nations.

2591 2018-08-08 19:13:07 @RFoster504 a real one for this discount. I ordered more beard oil and I still have 2 unopened bottles at home. That’s how much I support @VelvetNoirBC products
2592 2018-08-08 19:13:00 We're talking about building a refinery in Canada to refine Canada's oil for domestic consumption, not for export.
2593 2018-08-08 19:12:57 Lol. Canada has enough oil and natural gas to run rings around the Saudi Sand Potatoes. It simply has not been economical enough to develop of late. Other sellers are already lining up anyway.
2594 2018-08-08 19:12:40 If mahrez benches sterling then you spent 100m on two players for one role thanks to oil money got it?

2596 2018-08-08 19:12:11 Canada has both money and oil. They also have something even more precious: democracy.
2597 2018-08-08 19:12:11 With good governance, by now South-South would have been the best part of Nigeria not Abuja or Lagos. They have received trillions of Naira oil revenues, 13% derivation etc. Yes there was oil spillage & both states & FG must be made to account for the poor state of ND region.
2598 2018-08-08 19:12:00 S/O to Infiniti of Naperville for having computers LOL currently online shopping while waiting for an oil change 
2599 2018-08-08 19:11:53 Or oil splash for body
2600 2018-08-08 19:11:49 I would like to see Canada:
1. Cancel the arms contract and ban future sales with KSA.
2. Ban the import of oil from KSA.
3. Nationalize the Canadian Wheat Board and return control of it to farmers. (Take it from KSA owners who bought it from HarperCons.)

2610 2018-08-08 19:11:09 The issue becomes no one to buy no where to sell...and Canada has Reserves. Maduro will sell the oil in a heartbeat with his country collapsing.....this us a good precursor to smash OPEC apart....

2616 2018-08-08 19:10:41 Why just human rights abuse, Saudi Arabia has been the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world. And KSA will continue to get away with their nonsense. No one is really interested in what goes on inside Saudi Arabia. Everyone is only interested in their OIL.
2617 2018-08-08 19:10:37 The best people and worst people I have met in my life have been teachers. A black boy in a white school is like dropping oil in water. Most schools are heavily ran by out of touch elderly white women. These are the last breed of people you want educating your black children.
2618 2018-08-08 19:10:34 i love the color mixing that happens with clip's oil paint brushes but this shit fits in the first place
2619 2018-08-08 19:10:33 Lol. An oil change just turned into an oil change, tire rotation, new wipers, and a new cabin filter. I can't ever have kids because owning a car is too expensive 
2620 2018-08-08 19:10:29 No mate chilling with the Mrs, well, I am taking my bike for BPW on the Saturday but it looks like I'll be spending Friday getting some fork oil. She's working Friday daytime mind

2631 2018-08-08 19:09:50 There is no measure by which Russia can be said to be thriving. It's economy is in shambles, as it is mainly a petro-state and gas and oil prices have plummeted. It has a dwindling industrial base, a virtually non existent tech sector and is straining its already weak economy on

2635 2018-08-08 19:09:36 Great to see a host of smaller AIM oil and gas companies eventually react to the higher price environment. Some rerated with spot prices, others lagged and suddenly caught up on good news and value realisation..... There lies the opportunity with commodity stocks
2636 2018-08-08 19:09:32 You can't eat oil.
2637 2018-08-08 19:09:30 Good for him. Looking forward to listening to him call out Trudeau in Ottawa for his delusional decision to hand billions to former Enron executives, give up meek Paris goals and increase Alberta's dirty oil production. Canada needs real climate leadership.

2647 2018-08-08 19:08:37 Spanish people throw olive oil on fucking everything like it’s going out of fashion
2648 2018-08-08 19:08:34 Just like olive oil olive oil? Not some special type? Like the cooking one? Lmao I just want clarification
2649 2018-08-08 19:08:34 Wow you are actually pretty close to it :)  My advice is to go for the subscription, especially your first winter.  After that you can have a feel for when to order.  (Having run out of oil before)
2650 2018-08-08 19:08:23 Years ago it was easy to buy good extra virgin Italian or Greek olive oil. Now it’s harder so you have to check labels as quality gone down. I just buy Greek extra virgin and not processed but it’s reflective of how processed fats taking over .

2653 2018-08-08 19:08:03 Forget boycotting Saudi Oil. For all purposes, they are criminals and the oil is a proceed of crime because it helps fund and run their government. Aside from the oil, that stone they worship in Mecca that actually is a pagan idol... it needs to be destroyed completely.
2654 2018-08-08 19:07:59 Now to get serious, Alex Jones has done the following:
- uses his channel to peddle vitamin pills and snake oil
- constant harassment of Sandy Hook's victim's family
- threatening to shoot Robert Mueller
- inciting his followers to buren transgender people alive

... 
2655 2018-08-08 19:07:54 While we're at it, lets also stop buying their oil. The fact this country buys oil from that government is nuts.
2656 2018-08-08 19:07:37 The oil industry as we know it, including plastics, must die for us to survive. Let them die.

Let new petroleum based industries emerge that compliment the  paradigm of environmental stewardship that we must embrace.
2657 2018-08-08 19:07:36 Tree huggers have stopped Federal Government from thinning and removing dead trees. These forest's are nothing but massive stockpiles of kindling.

2658 2018-08-08 19:07:05 I just realized that the guy that usually checks me in for an oil change was the same guy who followed me on insta the other day and he hooked me up with a family discount!! YASSS!

2664 2018-08-08 19:06:22 7% of Norway's Oil Fund value invested in one company. It seems moronic just saying it.

2666 2018-08-08 19:06:14 Is my skin glowing or is it just oil????? The world may never know.
2667 2018-08-08 19:06:11 Maybe try:

"In light of the baseless threats from Saudia Arabia, an Albertan UCP government would relish the opportunity to work with all Canadians to ensure our country is oil self-sustaining"

Or something other than your usual stones in glass house.
2668 2018-08-08 19:06:08 Canada's GDP is more than double of Saudi Arabia. Canada could (if they wanted) flood the market with oil, hurting Saudi's economy which is almost entirely reliant on oil.
2669 2018-08-08 19:06:04 I should probably try it. Right now I use my oil cleanser which is based on coconut oil. Hahaha
2670 2018-08-08 19:05:59 And america will sell us oil in a heartbeat
2671 2018-08-08 19:05:41 You’re probably lacking keratin and vitamins. Whenever you have a chance soak your hair in olive oil mixed with castor oil for about 2 hrs min you can leave it in longer to help with growth and dryness.
2672 2018-08-08 19:04:58 I need my hair done, nails done, a massage, oil change, some shoes.... chile. Let me quit while I'm ahead

2674 2018-08-08 19:04:47    Olive oil contains anticoagulants that reduce the risk of blood clots and clogging of blood vessels. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #oliveoil #huiledolive 
2675 2018-08-08 19:04:36 Evaporators hardly get faulty..Obviously, there’s a leak in your condenser or the seal in your compressor is bad.. Also, check your AC pipe for oil residue.

2679 2018-08-08 19:04:10 Ya, we sell them our oil at a discount, they refined it into gasoline, and sell it back to us at a profit. Nice eh?

2681 2018-08-08 19:03:58 Considering Canada has quite the oil surplus, more than double the GDP per capita (similar populations), what levers does Saudi Arabia really have here?
2682 2018-08-08 19:03:54 So let me get this right. Canada gets upset over the imprisonment of a Saudi human rights activist, Arabia goes berserk and kicks out Canadians and pulls all students out of Canada, States refuses to back Canada because oil and $$$ are much more important than human rights.....

Upgraded or not, there is not enough capacity to ship what we produce. And while the world demands oil, Canada is the #1 nation to produce.

2719 2018-08-08 19:00:10 You called it “ethical oil”. It’s not ethical, because FNs have been denied the right to FPIC, and because this oil is stolen, extracted largely without consent from stolen land.

I only said those who use KSA abuses to justify rights violations here don’t care. Is that you?

2725 2018-08-08 19:00:00 FP:
Saudi Arabian oil imports in Canada have been steadily increasing for years. NEB data show the kingdom shipped an average of 102,000 barrels of oil per day to Canada last year, which was also up 17 per cent from an average of close to 87,000 bpd in 2016.

2733 2018-08-08 18:59:06 Wait, so we’re supposed to feel good about 1000 gallons of oil spilling into a river? Nope. That river is essentially dead already from a century of spills like this, and they won’t end until we move on from our oil & gas dependency.

2741 2018-08-08 18:58:22 Venezuela also had an economy based almost entirely on oil instead of diversifying so when oil prices tanked so did their economy. And the people in power protected themselves and their way of life over their greater community, not a socialist thing to do

2750 2018-08-08 18:57:38 Because we are running out of leeway and such events as this weekends will surely take away many of our already ludicrously scarce slots. We also stress about it because we seem required to fight niantic for any QoL updates. We hope the sooner we squeak, the quicker we get oil.

2794 2018-08-08 18:54:12 HAHA Good luck! Canada will not let that one fall.

2795 2018-08-08 18:54:09 SA could conceivable halt their oil exports to our east coast.  That would be very painful for gas, oil furnaces heating season. Wher can we make that up. Hope Trudeau figures that out.

2801 2018-08-08 18:53:24 A Lawyer calling anyone a Snake Oil Salesman needs to be added to the definition of both.
2802 2018-08-08 18:53:19 What kind of skin do you have?
I should have added a disclaimer. It’s not the best for people with naturally oily skin coz it clogs your pores 
Try shea butter or a lighter oil like avocado or grapeseed oil 
Pole 
2803 2018-08-08 18:53:12 Finna Fucc around get off that oil
2804 2018-08-08 18:53:09 Thought i had an oil leak but it was just water condensation from the AC
2805 2018-08-08 18:53:05 Tee tree oil
2806 2018-08-08 18:53:02 Global oil prices dropped and of course the good old pilfering too.
2807 2018-08-08 18:53:01 Noa-1 discovery does date back to 2001 - 17 years is a long time given the levels oil has reached in the meantime!
2808 2018-08-08 18:52:58 And #BPC did you look there as per tip in January.
2809 2018-08-08 18:52:53 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. -Proverbs 21:17 (KJV)
2810 2018-08-08 18:52:51 wild growth hair oil works sooooo good, i just hate the smell of it.
2811 2018-08-08 18:52:28 What, Canada not buying enough oil, or is it that Canads haven't got arms to sell to Saudis, arms that they don't need. The morons are being fleeced by UK & USA.
2812 2018-08-08 18:52:28 The oil companies by it, not the gov. But yes we should be using our own oil.
2813 2018-08-08 18:52:28 Future oil for sure! Guess the countries with the mines either get very rich or get a dictator!
2814 2018-08-08 18:52:20 Thc oil ain’t no joke. Had me waking up thinking I missed out on a full week of life.
2815 2018-08-08 18:52:19 <finishes hyperventilating into paper sack> i am sick of explaining to people that traceroute is a useless fake snake oil tool unless you are a god-tier network engineer with knowledge of every single network and node between the endpoints
2816 2018-08-08 18:52:18 Divest from Fossil Fuels before it's too late!.....  No Oil Money in Canada!...
2817 2018-08-08 18:52:06 horse shampoo and conditioner and when you get out the shower, put  tea tree oil (:
2818 2018-08-08 18:52:03 Given the rapidly increasing rate at which #HotHouse #GlobalWarming is being debated, it won't be surprise if the world become compelled to shutdown crude oil in the near future. Is Nigeria ready? 95% of our foreign earnings still depends on oil!
2819 2018-08-08 18:52:01 Imma need drake to right a song about tasha with the oil burns on her forearms leaving him because i would feel that
2820 2018-08-08 18:51:57 As somebody who has Asperger's, and is friendly with grandparents of a lovely, coming on leaps and bounds, person with Autism; that bleach crap disgusts me no end, and those peddling that snake oil should be jailed!
2821 2018-08-08 18:51:57 aku nak nasihat lelebih pun aku bukannya reti sgt bab skincare. pakai je la buat precaution. kalau rasa oil makeup remover tu dah cukup, ok je. selagi kulit kau xde masalah serius ok la kot.
2822 2018-08-08 18:51:51 let's not forget the newest innovation from trump industries
biodegradable oil that actually makes the oceans cleaner
if you want to learn about these amazing products and become part of the development team, remember to get enrolled at trump university.
2823 2018-08-08 18:51:49 It seems that the corruption of oil money is a common denominator in our main problems: corruption of our government (Trump-Putin), the rise of global oligarchs who buy control over governmental policy and the destruction of the environment.
2824 2018-08-08 18:51:41 Oil full your head my G. Proper 
2825 2018-08-08 18:51:39 I told the autistic kid I work with that it bothers me that he doesn't tie his apron (he trips over the strings & I work with moving blades & hot oil he's gonna get fucking hurt) & now he thinks I hate him so that's fucking annoying.
2826 2018-08-08 18:51:32 oil change today ; sometimes i wish i had a nigga to do this for me 
2827 2018-08-08 18:51:25 Coconut oil gives you clogged zits on your scalp. It's called comadkmetic or something. Basically it's oil that gets into your pores that your body can't break down, so it has to form a protective zit around the oil to expel it from the body
2828 2018-08-08 18:51:22 As an autist I smoke and vape legal CBD oil and it does reduce my anxiety.
2829 2018-08-08 18:51:19 U.S. oil closes at nearly 7-week low as U.S. inventory data whack market
2830 2018-08-08 18:50:58 Bio oil bby gyal ! 
2831 2018-08-08 18:50:58 The BoE put up interest rates affecting the poorest most, oil/petrol prices put up - affecting the poorest most, energy price rises affecting the poorest most, mortgage rises affecting the poorest most. Anyone else see a pattern?
2832 2018-08-08 18:50:57 I doubt we can get China and Russia to stop buying their oil.
2833 2018-08-08 18:50:41 #US Late Afternoon: WallSt is meandering on Wednesday; $DOW dull. Result updates from Health, Luxury & Online services came upbeat. Crude oil barrells receded last week; but Energy. While Banks, Softwares advance. $DJIA-0.09% $NASDAQ+0.17% $SPX+0.07%. $CVS+4.3%

2836 2018-08-08 18:50:27 well part of the problem is that the investment climate isn't very appearing right now. Part of that is within policymakers' control (tax rates, regulatory regime) and part isn't (Trump/NAFTA uncertainty, world oil prices).
2837 2018-08-08 18:50:19 I agree but you're the last person I would trust to stand up to big oil.
2838 2018-08-08 18:50:12 Outside of oil, the Saudis have nothing of value to trade.
2839 2018-08-08 18:50:10 Please. Tell me what country the tourist areas are in.
2840 2018-08-08 18:50:06 If it wasn't for the oil they'd be nobody
2841 2018-08-08 18:50:04 What the writer of this misses: it could be possible they only would like to take #tesla over to stop @elonmusk from being successful. As @GerberKawasaki pointed out, thats funny money to them. They could spend it to destroy tesla. They own all the OIL after all ;)
2842 2018-08-08 18:49:43 مو غريب مالي بالطيب نصيييب مو غريب دمع عيني من الحبيييي
2843 2018-08-08 18:49:40 @GOP, the money behind them, and the racists who love them; have everything at stake. They lose and it's the end of their long struggle. When #Putin got on board w/#Oligarchy (read: oil), they became an inevitable overriding, dominating force. That they operate covertly is worse

2847 2018-08-08 18:49:10 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2848 2018-08-08 18:49:09 of course they cant and they wont , because oil governs the world
2849 2018-08-08 18:49:05 $CRK imploding. If it traded at $PVAC multiple (better growth, more oil, lower leverage), would trade at like $3-4.
2850 2018-08-08 18:49:01 honestly it makes me SO EXCITED!!!! i bought a nice new tea tree toner and a seaweed oil control gel from body shop today as well which i’m v excited to use!!!
2851 2018-08-08 18:49:00 Car definitely needs an oil change. Put it off for a while now...
2852 2018-08-08 18:48:59 So #oil retreats on fear #tariffs hurt economy/demand. Easily perceived, immediate drop in #gasoline price masks briefly (till #Election2018) any #TradeWar harm to jobs, economy. As political strategy it might work. Risk is stalled jobs creation, #unemployment rise #OOTT #energy
2853 2018-08-08 18:48:59 @Sawbones @sydneemcelroy I have a question. Listened to your CBD Oil podcast this wk and all the issues ppl claim it treats. Are our cannabinoid receptors similar to opiate receptors in that if we build tolerance we have to increase dosage? Thanks and keep making great episodes!
2854 2018-08-08 18:48:56 Will have to try to get into town and stock up. Need some canola oil.
2855 2018-08-08 18:48:56 Saw Abraham Lincoln's chair in a Michigan history museum in the early 70s. Was grossed out by the hair oil stain where his head rested on the upper part of the chair. My teenage self unable to focus on the more important parts of history.
2856 2018-08-08 18:48:55 Sounds about right, think i got a bottle of oil for about £15!
2857 2018-08-08 18:48:50 Where are they going to get their oil from, Russia? Iran? Who? The US? Come on Canada,  you messed up this one, and are talking to wrong people.
2858 2018-08-08 18:48:48 Hey, if you don’t want the oil, then don’t vote for the snake.
2859 2018-08-08 18:48:46 @MikeHudema prefers Saudi oil
2860 2018-08-08 18:48:45 and ya know maybe we should keep our dirty oil, because like Quebec said Albertans are just spoiled assholes. right?
2861 2018-08-08 18:48:23 So tea tree oil and castor oil, both can be found in a pharmacy
2862 2018-08-08 18:48:22 @dale_hoogs eastern Canada shouldn't be getting any oil what it should be getting is gasoline from Canadian refineries.....

2868 2018-08-08 18:47:40 Most of the malls are Run by Knight Frank, Shell is a reputable oil company. Lawyers own most of the buildings. 

What other information do you need? 

Kanjo gave a mod. NEMA gave a nod. So where do you want the tenant to go for this so called "due deligence"?

2871 2018-08-08 18:47:34 Ebay! But have a look at the fox site for oil weights/levels for that year of fork!
2872 2018-08-08 18:47:30 Is it true that this was the first ever oil painting ?
2873 2018-08-08 18:47:29 If anything I hope it exposes that oil companies do the Same thing to avoid hiring domestic commercial boat operators
2874 2018-08-08 18:47:16 Why is it when Huge companies pay fines to stay out of jail money NEVER goes to Victims.Cigarette Lawsuits/Health Fraud lawsuits/Banking fines/Oil Environment Lawsuits.Why do States get to keep money for what they want? As a smoker who was defrauded for 25 yrs I never got a dime.
2875 2018-08-08 18:47:06 You feel total sales figures will capture Palm Oil smuggled into the country? If imports are off records, sales are likely to be so too.
2876 2018-08-08 18:47:05 My favourite ever Christmas scent was an oil from Wax Lyrical called Home for the Holidays. I have hoarded it, almost never use it.  I’ve just been & sniffed it now.  It’s so evocative it brings me close to tears.  But although I usually have a good nose, I just can’t define it.
2877 2018-08-08 18:47:04 Honestly broccoli, bit of sesame oil, bit of soy sauce whack it in oven for 10 minutes....find me a better snack
2878 2018-08-08 18:46:51 You're sweet sir, but I walked off oil rigs to come work with sailors, there's no need to warn the guys about cursing in front me.

2887 2018-08-08 18:46:08 Honestly, most republicans are now snake oil salesman. Its sad for what once was a "grand ole party".  Just a bunch of unethical, racist, gutless, crooks.

Remember the first thing the current gop house did was try to dissolve ethics oversight!
2888 2018-08-08 18:46:02 If I rearrange the drawers and bed in mu bedroom. Then spray the room with rose petal oil, harnessing the aura of the Feng Shui, while chanting "Vaccines are evil" would that work too?

2897 2018-08-08 18:45:22 Maybe, it's time these oil protesters, really try and understand that Canada is better off producing, it's own oil than relying on oil from countries with human right violations! They should be protesting, against Groper Trudeau! Their two faced hero!

2899 2018-08-08 18:45:16 Forget oil. It will be a miracle if they survive with such poor diplomatic instincts. They horribly miscalculated here and are making it worse by not cutting their losses and apologizing.

2906 2018-08-08 18:44:32 And Irving has already said that even if energy east was built, they’d still import oil first and foremost, before buying Canadian oil. Irving is the biggest tax break-welfare company in Canada. New Brunswick is getting completely hosed by them b/c of taxes over a land deal
2907 2018-08-08 18:44:32 On 7/12, a truck hauling crude oil crashed on a bridge over the Price Riv. at US Highway 6. The accident spilled of up to 4K gal. of crude oil onto the road surface. As much as 1K gal. of crude oil flowed into the river, creating the potential for long-term environmental impacts.

2914 2018-08-08 18:43:54 Canada has one major thing in common with Saudi Arabia: our government cares more about oil profits and perpetuating oil dependence than about future generations or the state of the planet. Canada is also a force for global instability via climate chaos

2944 2018-08-08 18:41:12 the reality is there have been some chunky sells.. Also buys. All shares spike on a good returns. COPL have said that news will arrive this month. If/when it does if NNPC/Finance this will fly . SP priced as a shell not one with proven oil .

but for the life of me I don’t understand why your obè will be swimming in cooking oil.

2950 2018-08-08 18:40:40 Only because of oil, if oil was sideways to up, the Dow would also be up..  Its just ridiculous complacency in all of these indices.. No risk in holding, the market will never drop again because the CB's will save us..

2957 2018-08-08 18:40:11 ETF stands for “exchange-traded fund” and describes a kind of investment fund where the price of assets like gold, stocks and oil can be tracked.

2960 2018-08-08 18:40:00 Lol abi to find a way out
2961 2018-08-08 18:39:55 Not only did Harper have to contend with the world's worst financial crisis in 2008 to 2010, he also had to deal with a catastrophic collapse in oil prices in 2014. You are lucky, an American economy on fire, higher oil prices and no Financial collapse... Count your blessings.
2962 2018-08-08 18:39:53 The benefits of taking Black Seed Oil very interesting read through it carefully.
2963 2018-08-08 18:39:51 why my mans got tanning oil in a Tilex spray bottle im finished
2964 2018-08-08 18:39:51 What the actual fuck. Who is CHOOSING THESE PEOPLE.
It’s like someone is saying “who is the WORST POSSIBLE CHOICE for this role”
An oil lobbyist for environment.
A con artist and thief for commerce.
A religious trust fund baby with 80 for education.
WHAT. THE. FUCK. AMERICA.

2966 2018-08-08 18:39:47 Oh wow that’s what I do too. Well when I do wash and go’s other times I use Argan oil and this other producf named Eden. You should try it.

2973 2018-08-08 18:39:18 I don't know, but rest assured he will find something else.  The sandwich story has lost legs.  I predict petrol, gas, oil, butterflies and bees will be next on his "agenda".  Maybe even migrating birds will not come to UK because of lack of food and water.    WATER!   Just wait.
2974 2018-08-08 18:39:06 20-30 years no one will be burning fossil fuels or will be sanctioned. #Climate makes oil a sunset industry.
2975 2018-08-08 18:39:03 In CLOAK AND DAGGER it's at least ostensibly an oil rig. Digging something on the ocean floor
2976 2018-08-08 18:38:54 You’d also realize that technology is transforming the workplace. Driverless trucks in the Oil Sands, more IT less HR on rigs, that technology is transforming the workplace. The recovery is happening, but it’s unlike anything we’ve seen before. #ableg
2977 2018-08-08 18:38:47 What a lot of people don’t know about the oilpocalypse is that the companies involved used the toxic dispersant Corexit to sink the oil out of sight. Corexit is banned in many European nations because it can cause extinctions of vital links in the ‘web of life.’ Plus, other ills.

2981 2018-08-08 18:38:35 who cares? we should stop buying their oil.
2982 2018-08-08 18:38:34 @PlayDomiNations why isn't there museum artifact that increases the amount of food from farms? Seen gold from caravans, oil from oil wells, gold from gold mines, resources from fruit trees. However no food from farms. Food one of the most used resource in game and there nothing
2983 2018-08-08 18:38:32 Curious why we only see protesters for exporting oil but never for importing oil to the east from the middle east.
2984 2018-08-08 18:38:24 very interesting, the journalist keep mentioning about the oil rich. No connection with what is going on now. you call this a clash between two personalities? I didn’t get it.
Why is nobody talkings Brit’s interest in this region? They  funded and helped to establish Liyu police.

2991 2018-08-08 18:37:45 you should become the surgeon general.  your knowledge is encyclopedic and you're smart enough to apply what you know.

btw, i used your homemade products from your essential oil creations and they work amazingly well.  thank you.
2992 2018-08-08 18:37:38 Serious answer? High tariffs on materials and components will make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture in the US. Closest (cuz high oil prices = expensive shipping) low cost manufacturing region: Mexico.

2996 2018-08-08 18:37:04 Weird question did you use olive oil? I’m only asking because I use olive oil for everything lol especially for my skin. I can usually tell but I want to make sure. If not start using cuz it helps your skin firmness, like breast and anti-aging  be great sis

Secondly how would you value them ? discounting long into the future will not work as its totally uncertain due to EV disruption etc. If cars start running on battery what these OMCs will do ?

3007 2018-08-08 18:36:15 Blaming Harper is getting tired, its been over 3 years.  Corrupt inept lying @liberal_party could have cancelled dealing with the Saudi's instead of having the Saudi's slap them down.  Where will we get oil since the morons have cancelled all pipelines including Energy East

3010 2018-08-08 18:36:02 Much of the world's RW's denying climate change, allowing unfettered greed & corporate pollution to happen. This is why I'm so angry w some foolish liberals who still haven't stopped lecturing the over straws & pre-sliced fruit/ veggies. Our community hasn't caused oil spills

3018 2018-08-08 18:35:27 Agreed. Hope we stop buying Saudi oil as a result

3022 2018-08-08 18:35:12 We need to ban New Mexicans and replace them with Old Mexicans ...
3023 2018-08-08 18:35:01 I need a oil change & my wheels aligned before I go back to school.
3024 2018-08-08 18:35:00 Not sure about 5x but Trump bitched about OPEC and demanded Saudi Pump more oil...

We're not part of OPEC and we give America oil...

But we're a national security threat and we smuggle shoes...
3025 2018-08-08 18:34:56 I hope Trudeau bought the pipeline to keep it out of foreign hands and to let the project idle and die. We need to focus on cleaner energy sources. Keep the oil for when we really need it.

3036 2018-08-08 18:33:56 That's a starch clump! Not pretty, but harmless. Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. These starches collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but missed this one. I'm sorry!
3037 2018-08-08 18:33:43 Just got an oil change and was so proud to shake the hands of three wonderful young men from a couple of past schools. Each bright, but “couldn’t stay still” (their words). They love what they do, they are using their skills and they were so proud to prove it. I love my job!
3038 2018-08-08 18:33:38 That is the truth. If we now think that's the wrong approach, this is a positive evolution. It's not as if we don't have oil. We're rich. We don't depend on Saudi wealth. It's not the Cold War now. We don't have any excuses left.

3057 2018-08-08 18:32:27 We know who controls the purse strings in the grand scheme of international banking technologies anyhow. With technology the Saudi's can just learn on-line or see how the prices in oil fluctuate, plus we can control budgets, funding, + pretty much everything through Space Command

3064 2018-08-08 18:31:38 Had a dream i wanted to buy a car, but in order to buy it I had to volunteer at the place changing oil etc etc. Woke up in the middle of trying to negotiate working hours 
3065 2018-08-08 18:31:29 I put a shirt that I wear in her crib so it smells like me & I have a young living essential oil diffuser in her room going all night

3069 2018-08-08 18:30:53 Something that we wii rub with anointing oil bfor we use 
3070 2018-08-08 18:30:50 Canada's economy dwarfs that of Saudi Arabia. We do very little in the way of trade and we charge their foreign students ridiculous sums to attend our universities. Those spots will be filled quickly by other foreign students. We don't rely on Saudi oil.
3071 2018-08-08 18:30:46 There are other sources of oil.
3072 2018-08-08 18:30:41 Heat advisory in effect, but our Clean Street Team is still out keeping the neighborhood clean from grease/oil. #chinatown #chinatownnyc #sohotinhere  @ Chinatown (Manhattan)
3073 2018-08-08 18:30:39 He’s trying to create it where as Americans we hate the price of oil (gas) so much from other countries that we allow drilling on American soil aka: Alaska which will DESTROY ecosystems & wildlife but gain millions of dollars for himself or his peers
3074 2018-08-08 18:30:35 China announces 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods including crude oil and cars
3075 2018-08-08 18:30:33 Probably just dry, clean up and fresh oil should stop that from getting any worse. Obviously fresh seals will help! 

You got a pic!?
3076 2018-08-08 18:30:28 Don't talk about Tehran or Iran when you meant and talk about criminal syndicate of mullahs! They just need Trump let them make mony from oil exports to rub most of it and pay the remaining to terrorists,it's all

3082 2018-08-08 18:30:16 OLIVE OIL OR COCONUT OIL!!!!!
3083 2018-08-08 18:30:04 Gang ~demo~oil
3084 2018-08-08 18:29:58 Yes I totally agree. We should not have anything to do with Saudi Arabia and if we step up production of oil we may be able to be self sufficient.
3085 2018-08-08 18:29:55 Read to understand not to reply, I don't see anywhere she said bambam invented oil, dummy
3086 2018-08-08 18:29:52 Yes Milano, it's All a Huge Conspiracy from Russia to get More Republicans elected, so that they can Continue to put HUGE amounts of pressure on Russia by the U.S. becoming the Largest Source of Oil & Gas in the World.
By selling Nat Gas to the E.U., it undercuts RUSSIA.
3087 2018-08-08 18:29:39 No denying that fam.. the oil escalated everything..
3088 2018-08-08 18:29:30 People are beginning to open their eyes and using their own brains rather than mindlessly following a snake oil salesman
3089 2018-08-08 18:29:26 The man isn't a journalist. He's a conspiracy theorist and snake oil salesman. Your inability to tell the difference is somewhat disturbing.
3090 2018-08-08 18:29:19 If you drop the margins back to historical average 2-2.5% then they are not trading cheap at all. 
Today one has to take call on these stocks on the basis of why Gov will not do stupid stuff ?
If inflation remain under control.
If oil remain under control.
If Rupee remain stable.
3091 2018-08-08 18:29:13 Assive City dont pay money?
Ur club is based on Oil money so leave money alone, and what he said about jose? Show me plz
3092 2018-08-08 18:29:12 the one plus is that the bleach will strip my hair but it’ll make my oil levels go down
3093 2018-08-08 18:29:03 California Coastal Commission now hearing potential land swap item that would see restoration of wetlands in LB but also new oil developments near 2nd/PCH.
3094 2018-08-08 18:28:52 We should stop buying their dirty oil.  We have enough oil in Canada and the means to safely extract and refine it for decades to come. It will create thousands of jobs and boost our economy. #sorrynotsorrysaudiarabia
3095 2018-08-08 18:28:51 A Russian, snake oil salesman.
3096 2018-08-08 18:28:41 I love how my conversation with my client went from changing the cat litter to Jamaican Castor oil and peppermint for your edges

-4 Tbls of vegetable glycerin

-10 drops o essential oil 

Mix together 
3098 2018-08-08 18:28:18 What if Trump does the Mueller interview, BUT,...hires Bill Clinton as coach!? Depends on your definition of "as", but Trump could oil himself up so well, he'd shoot out of the witness chair like soap gripped by a methhead.
3099 2018-08-08 18:28:18 Wow... obviously no one can determine the exact time the well will run dry... dumbass

My point is .... it will... or do you think oil is never ending ?

You probably do
3100 2018-08-08 18:28:16 Big oil conquered the world because big hemp never could have.
3101 2018-08-08 18:28:13 I’m at dealership getting oil changed.  

Guy: I really like Jeeps, but I heard you have to wave at everyone.

Me:  Ok, but the Jeep police aren’t going to come take you to Jeep jail if you don’t wave. I promise. 

Come on, man!
3102 2018-08-08 18:28:11 Oh and key input into plastic manufacture: oil. Yip. #JustSaying
3103 2018-08-08 18:28:06 Don't we get 5x as much oil from Canada as we do from Saudi Arabia?
3104 2018-08-08 18:27:58 Not that it matters, but how many world cup trophies does any arab country have? Let me rephrase: how many arab countries excels in anything besides ISIS and oil?
3105 2018-08-08 18:27:40 Trying to make one point? Really? You should watch the video I posted. Oil is involved in chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, synthetics, apparel, plastics, etc. Hemp was eliminated as competition for all things oil. All things from oil are toxic.
3106 2018-08-08 18:27:38 There's nothing quite like going in for an oil change and getting an estimate of $1,500 in repairs.Then having a nosey customer say that I could sell it. No thanks dude, this is the last major thing I have of my Dad. He taught me to drive in it. Not ready to give her up yet
3107 2018-08-08 18:27:36 And no its not the same, that bakery isnt the largest bakery in the country, they do not have a monopoly on said baking, blondie. Thats like saying well if you dont like the price of gas go start your own oil refining company.
3108 2018-08-08 18:27:31 Today’s drive:
UFO’s
Desert, Yucca, Joshua Trees
Dry grass, smoke, fruit & nut trees
Smattering of oil wells
3109 2018-08-08 18:27:21 Yes rosemary & peppermint oil from young living essential oils.
3110 2018-08-08 18:27:06 - Tulsa people. Be advised.

3116 2018-08-08 18:26:24 Normal day of doing @KreutzMeARiver’s laundry:
Oil rags, hitch pins, nuts and bolts, loose change, and snack wrappers mixed in with all the normal stuff you find in laundry, like clothes. #farmerswife #checkyourpockets
3117 2018-08-08 18:26:18 Feel the burn get the oil out 
3118 2018-08-08 18:26:16 Working on incorporating some new self care practices into my routine. Bought dried lavender to make sachets for my pajama drawer, switched my perfume to essential oil roll-ons, started keeping music on while I work, and have been trying to take really good care of my skin.
3119 2018-08-08 18:26:14 #ShineFmDaystar
#ShineFmNews
Iran's foreign minister  states that the United States will not hinder it from exporting oil.
3120 2018-08-08 18:26:12 MPL as well. It has oil and hair food. I buy both and use concurrently.
3121 2018-08-08 18:26:12 I'm aware of the Tulsa and all the independent black towns that arose during the early 20th century. They even had oil fields. We have to learn from those and rebuild. It would never be smooth but we have to keep at it.
3122 2018-08-08 18:26:07 #Oil_India bought 6,000,000 barrels of #US crude for delivery from November to January, as an alternatives to Iranian crude before US sanctions come into force, Reuters reported. #Oil #Iran #USA
3123 2018-08-08 18:25:54 look at an oil futures chart.  You will then see why.  If you have no idea how global financial markets are run then sit down and let the big boys handle it
3124 2018-08-08 18:25:51 The contract Dion and JT signed off on? 
If Trudeau regs hadn't ended Energy East to appease his greenie base,we'd have no need for Saudi oil now. Harper isn't PM, hasn't been for 3 years.
3125 2018-08-08 18:25:49 Ah,  differences between the usual snake oil salesmen and
45 are substantial in cash.  He 
makes his oil, buys his own bottles and labels-fills them,  does his own distribution and is
his own loudest advertisement!
Monopoly!  Small outlay, big profit!  Poor snake oil salesmen!
3126 2018-08-08 18:25:42 Just wondering if you think Canada should continue to import Saudi oil?
3127 2018-08-08 18:25:40 Mr. Trump and environmental "experts" who say global warming is a "hoax", or more precisely the oil and coal interests who pay them off, now have blood on their hands. People are dying in fires, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes that are intensifying in strength and frequency.
3128 2018-08-08 18:25:31 The money most likely will come from Saudis since they want to diversify from oil. I was a bear on TSLA until yesterday, where the bear case was thrown out... it's no longer a bear case but merger arbitrage case.
3129 2018-08-08 18:25:29 So, What really changed how they started making lot higher margins recently ? 
Its just on the Government wish. So i believe the fear is due to lots of elections Gov might start subsiding Oil again ( as they used to do before ) on the expense of OMCs.
3130 2018-08-08 18:25:23 but....but Jane...not to worry....Maine just banned the Jap Bush.....now there will be no ticks in Maine.....wow look at that quick fix...(not)....LMAO..... We know for a fact CDC HAS beat around the bush... So how's CDC's Grapefruit Oil answer going...NY was told that's the fix!
3131 2018-08-08 18:25:14 /rlt/ kak aku kan mau beli haple, mending aku beli 2 oil 1 rose atau 3 oil sekalian? Kan basah basahannya bisa pake yg lain? Hehehe
3132 2018-08-08 18:25:10 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President I along with millions of others will Not tolerate you selling our public lands or coasts to any oil companies. You explore renewable energy and we mean Renewable Energy
3133 2018-08-08 18:25:07 At what point does Canada just start turning the taps off and exploring different markets.

Last I heard, oil and sand are hard on the digestive system.
3134 2018-08-08 18:24:55 Some girls so focused on weight gaining they forget to oil up their shit for when the process happens  skin gon pull & stretch, don't forget
3135 2018-08-08 18:24:50 ارجو الاهتمام بتشجير الخط منظر كئيب
3136 2018-08-08 18:24:48 Nah Im still geeked about the oil lady from potomac mills joaning on me “ you dont wanna buy these oils but your about to go into armani exchange and get their clothes from china “
3137 2018-08-08 18:24:44 Why his supporters didn't recognize that he was a snake oil salesman is BEYOND me!!! (I guess that's why there ARE snake oil salesman....there are lots of gullible people in the world.)
3138 2018-08-08 18:24:35 If I need sand or oil i’Ll go to America
3139 2018-08-08 18:24:28 Truth be told I am still in shock that Trudeau Liberals had the balls to criticize ANYTHING to do Islam never mind a regime who we import oil from. When he does it backfires, ugh. Strategy isn’t really this governments strong suit !!
3140 2018-08-08 18:24:28 Oh dear God! How delusional can you be! Trumps economy is hurting more people in the US than it’s helping. The asbestos industry as well as oil gas and pesticides are doing allright tho. Especially in Russia!!!
3141 2018-08-08 18:24:15 "We" don't do anything. Private enterprise does. "We" don't own the oil.

 Stop being a child and learn how the world works.
3142 2018-08-08 18:24:08 The club is a purely a business. Honestly hope we're bought out for all Cities oil money there's been a plan to be the best. United's plan
3143 2018-08-08 18:24:07 Have you seen a 10 drop in gas prices?
Doug Ford lied to you - only the oil companies benefited from cutting cap & trade. We got nothing. No 10 cent drop.
@fordnation working for his Bay St elite friends, you won't see 1p cents.
3144 2018-08-08 18:24:04 I use regular MPL oil and hair food from Pep. It's really good as well. For the rest of that head try out Sulfur8 spray. It's been so good to me!
3145 2018-08-08 18:24:00 But Iran provides us Rupee payment mechanism.  Oil is more important than high tech imports?
3146 2018-08-08 18:23:58 I needa damn oil change 
3147 2018-08-08 18:23:38 In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving
3148 2018-08-08 18:23:38 Eco Styler. The olive oil based one. Not a single bad advertisement gonna make me stop using it 
3149 2018-08-08 18:23:31 Snake oil salesmen with nukes and the power to arrest and kill our fellow citizens.
3150 2018-08-08 18:23:20 War and oil. The rest is deep state, lol. Humans, being.
3151 2018-08-08 18:23:20 No I am not ok with the tankers either. We have better technology now and need to start taking steps to eliminate all oil transports in all ways and switch to sun and wind generation for power. Its clean and renewable energy.
3152 2018-08-08 18:23:04 I figured this would push brent up if China buys less US oil. I'm surprised its down so sharply. I guess the greater concern is the effect this trade war will have on the global economy.
3153 2018-08-08 18:22:58 I was being facetious dumbass
Renewables.... ever hear of them?

Oil is non renewable... once it’s gone... it’s gone

Demand is high... now

But thanx to climate change the focus is shifting to renewables 

Do you not read?
3154 2018-08-08 18:22:44 Snake oil...more like a shit salesman!!! DT is en embarrassment to our country with all the corruption, lies, stealing kids, deporting parents, filling the swamp, racism...ya u get the picture...I f can’t stand him! Where are the MISSING CHILDREN AT THE BORDER!!!
3155 2018-08-08 18:22:38 So Russia and the aliens are working together? I knew it! It’s those oil puddle guys from X-Files!
3156 2018-08-08 18:22:32 Mr. President I along with millions of others will Not tolerate you selling our lands to any oil companies.
3157 2018-08-08 18:22:29 Palm oil is the easiest oil to use in foods. It’s in pretty much everything we eat. It’s in soap and other household products. Easiest to make a lot of as well.
3158 2018-08-08 18:22:25 No other team can compete with them mate so lets not go there. Not all the clubs have oil money. We've already spent most we've ever had in a single window.
3159 2018-08-08 18:22:23 Ako alam ko na dati na surname niya yun, pero ngayon ko lang narealize na Olive Oyl = Olive Oil. 
3160 2018-08-08 18:22:16 When she makes you blush and oil starts leaking <<<<<<<
3161 2018-08-08 18:22:14 "The letter highlighted how the U.S. wants to continue to work together  with Russia on

countering terrorism- 'Since you cry like American baby...'
enhancing legislative dialogue- 'new rule is...'
and resuming cultural exchange- 'you bring own baby oil.' 
</decypher>"
3162 2018-08-08 18:22:11 Are you are being a little harsh on the peanut-sugar-soybean-and-hydrogenated-cotton-seed-and-canola oil butter. Uh, did I forget the mono and diglycerides? The ingredient list says it all. And you are so very right when it comes to the Remark product. It is the real deal. Yummy.
3163 2018-08-08 18:21:49 Every time I decide to fry food I forget that my apartment is one room and EVERYTHING smells like oil afterwards
3164 2018-08-08 18:21:47 In a fit of peak Maddie I dropped the tuna can into the pan of tuna pasta bake sauce and splashed olive oil and sauce all over my front incl my glasses lol
3165 2018-08-08 18:21:40 done
3166 2018-08-08 18:21:40 Try lavender oil. It always works for me.
3167 2018-08-08 18:21:31 Happy Wednesday  let me know what oil  u know and can help #Doterra
3168 2018-08-08 18:21:26 Oil rather
3169 2018-08-08 18:21:17 Let's just make sure there's at least one Canadian on the buying side of that temper tantrum, and it's not some combo market-humiliation / fire sale security transfer to the Kochs or Trump Oil or some dirty garbage.
3170 2018-08-08 18:21:12 They would find a better use for that money if they were helping fund CBD oil for children with seizures. It's a shame they can't see the forest for the trees.  Times have changed, and the people that made those selfish and bigotry archaic laws are now dead, gone, and forgotten.
3171 2018-08-08 18:21:06 When it comes to Tesla, Oil and Transport, the experts and the politicians *are* the problem. #disruption
3172 2018-08-08 18:20:57 見える人のお話。大麻から抽出したオイルで小児ガンが治ったという体験の映像も観たことがあります。アメリカにもHemp Oil（ヘンプ・オイル）や大麻の実が健康食品店で販売されていて、面白半分で買ってときどき食しています。ヘンプ・オイルは真緑のオイルで、抹茶みたいな濃い色で強烈な味なのですが
3173 2018-08-08 18:20:56 Listen to the Meggie's... Wunna want Lil Bengays and camphor oil to rub down after the 7oclock news
3174 2018-08-08 18:20:54 EVs need more proportion of non ferrous metals. Also, very soon coal based power stations will get migrated to oil and gas based because of environmental sustainability initiatives. So in both cases, his vision supports independent India.
3175 2018-08-08 18:20:50 Yes ma'am try it.  We must continue to keep our tits lifted up and anointed!!!  I'm going to oil mine up twice a day.
3176 2018-08-08 18:20:38 Also less oil and more protein
3177 2018-08-08 18:20:32 I have yet to meet an adorable man without an opinion ... it seems they cute blonds are the targets for this sudden influx of male uprising. much preferred it when you could avoid the chatty Gary's and Barry's because they wore glasses, duffle coat and smelled of patchouli oil.
3178 2018-08-08 18:20:31 Which will exacerbate the situation with even higher fuel prices in the UK. A double hit from both a falling pound, and rising oil market supply worries.
3179 2018-08-08 18:20:29 It's entirely possible you can absorb magnesium through your skin, either through water or oil. But there's not a significant body of research to support that claim & there's research that calls the claim into question. Send me a study that's compelling and I'll happily read it.
3180 2018-08-08 18:20:28 Except oil prices rebounded and now the frackers are back and all the Saudis did was shoot themselves in the foot.
3181 2018-08-08 18:20:14 Anyway (maybe ask here is actually holding this looks exactly how you can recycle vegetable oil)?
3182 2018-08-08 18:20:12 Lots of shampoo and oil treatments and stuff nje
3183 2018-08-08 18:20:09 People will pray for cake, but when life gives them eggs, oil, butter, flour, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen. 
3184 2018-08-08 18:19:57 Wonderful photo! Looks like an oil painting
3185 2018-08-08 18:19:57 I put oil on my scalp and hair is growing perfectly and isn’t breaking off 
3186 2018-08-08 18:19:48 Apparently we don’t use too much Saudi oil.  We prefer to ruin the environment with North American oil.  That won’t keep us from paying double, though.
3187 2018-08-08 18:19:39 I should marinate my chicken more. This stuff I put in a bit of mirin and chili oil last night has a flavor I can only describe as "deep and abiding".
3188 2018-08-08 18:19:37 Last anyone looked Canada is an exporting nation of oil. Reality is Canada needs nothing from Saudi Arabia except a big useless headache. Do your research before you post..
3189 2018-08-08 18:19:36 I have an earlier box of Rohmer that has a warning before each film that amongst other things the dvd cannot be shown on oil rigs. You can imagine them storming off and into the first dinghy to shore.
3190 2018-08-08 18:19:34 ？
3191 2018-08-08 18:19:32 It might be an oil mark???? I’ve been suiting in very public places lately so it’s something from there, this claw is the worst but it’s on all of my claws a little bit. So I’ll try the scrub method
3192 2018-08-08 18:19:32 Hope it includes oil imports from the kingdom!
3193 2018-08-08 18:19:29 With no USSR & a N.Y. state GDP, Russia cannot maintain their world military might. Only Merkel can help with her idiotic gas/oil pipelines to,Germany allowing Putin his treasury. The E.U. MUST stop tis line PERIOD. Germany/Merkel./Russia/Putin..like peas in a pod.
3194 2018-08-08 18:19:28 “cough” oil “cough”
3195 2018-08-08 18:19:25 although Geologically Pakistan is not oil producing country, 9Gas reserves are expected) but it is also fact that if ur Ruler is sincere, Allah reveals the hidden treasures of land i.e. minerals, agri and other stuff.  Prayers for Pakistan
3196 2018-08-08 18:19:20 How long before SA runs out of oil?
3197 2018-08-08 18:19:07 You must be a used car salesmen 

We have some of the largest reserves in the world and should be expanding production to meet. Instead we import oil and hypocrites like you support. Yup stupid.
3198 2018-08-08 18:19:06 Sugar industry has a whole lot of responsibility for this, but no one wants to say it, or do anything about it. They talk about oil and coal. It’s past time we address the sugar pollution.
3199 2018-08-08 18:19:02 I could find no research on absorption of magnesium through oil, since water alters the size of magnesium molecules so that would make a difference.
3200 2018-08-08 18:19:01 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
3201 2018-08-08 18:18:46 What will SA when they run out of oil?
Maybe Canada will be hiring 
3202 2018-08-08 18:18:45 Why these logics failed? Due to Domestic buyers or not listening mf investors or diehard bulls or trapped bears, Rupees n oil upword move or gold loosing sheen in indian psyche ? @NileshShah68 @BrainandMoney @DrVaibhavK9
3203 2018-08-08 18:18:39 Fuck the east they shafted us for years if they need our oil now I say screw them and let them have a long cold winter.

@NoriaCorp 
If you please 
I have one question 
If compressed nitrogen gas leaks into hydraulic oil, it react and cause water in oil or no? Because always we found water in oil although there are NO heat, cooling water or any other extrnal source.
Thanks alot
3206 2018-08-08 18:18:27 Until they announce the purchase of a blockchain company instead of oil lmao. Imo the risk of buying a stock that is run by a con-man outweighs any reward. Try talking to the guy, you'll see exactly what I mean 
3207 2018-08-08 18:18:26 Don't put oil into fire, you racist!
3208 2018-08-08 18:18:26 There is no scarcity of resources research #primarywater oil does not come from dinosaurs either they are both abiotic  created deep beneath the earth’s mantle
3209 2018-08-08 18:18:20 Haha tapi kan aku cm ragu2 la sebab kan aku baca iman kabo, kena double cleanse which is pakai oil cleanser tp aku gi klinik ritu dia kabo takleh nnt muka jadi kering. Kompius la
3210 2018-08-08 18:18:03 Is the BTUs in hemp oil greater than or less than the BTUs in petroleum?
3211 2018-08-08 18:18:01 TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT. I can ever consider doing the sacrilege of poisoning my coffee with coconut oil
3212 2018-08-08 18:17:58 Use MPL OIL that contains coconut oil. You buy it at pnp, dischem, checkers etc. about 25rnd or so. It says on the bottle MPL oil with COCONUT oil. Apply everyday before going to sleep.
3213 2018-08-08 18:17:51 Yes! I’ve been referring to him as a snake oil salesman since day one! Always was, always will be...
3214 2018-08-08 18:17:47 Joe Lieberman is a washed up hack. By tearing up the Iran deal tRUMP has now directed a lot of oil money to Russia. Putin really got his money’s worth by throwing tRUMP the election.
3215 2018-08-08 18:17:43 If true then #US and west will have to change their behavior towards #Pakistan or else #China will have its KSA next to its border allowing very safe continues supply of oil.
3216 2018-08-08 18:17:41 Yeah just devolves into a publisher versus platform argument that is as dated as people arguing about the difference between kerosene and whale oil
3217 2018-08-08 18:17:38 Gratz to the "self made" oil baroness...
3218 2018-08-08 18:17:38 Yes, we're in it now, and should cease importing Saudi oil among other things. I can't imagine how we could continue with that.
3219 2018-08-08 18:17:32 If I break your heart na oil spillage
I study this your love for freedom college
3220 2018-08-08 18:17:30 Oil is not the answer. The Growth Commission tries to provide growth by growing the Scottish population through mass immigration. And to encourage immigrants to come suggests they get tax breaks.
3221 2018-08-08 18:17:26 We were selling cut rate oil to the Americans during the Conservative government as well, so this is nothing new.  The question I have is what would you do about it?  Pipeline or not we'd still be the US's biggest supplier.  How would you get a bigger price?
3222 2018-08-08 18:17:24 Republican checklist: 
1. Destroy voting rights 
2. Crony capitalism 
3. Tax cuts for rich 
4. Oil & Coal assists 
5. Bring back asbestos
6. Destroy human and civil rights
7. Destroy social safety net 
8. Promote global anti-democratic tyrannical agenda 
3223 2018-08-08 18:17:22 Step two is, apparently, not pulling them because a nazi and/or an oil exec would get upset about it.
3224 2018-08-08 18:17:17 No it's a deal for now. See my other tweet in thread. High tech imports in exchange of giving up iran oil
3225 2018-08-08 18:17:16 Covered my eyes in baby oil to try and get my lash extensions off, got oil in my eyes, basically blind and my extensions haven’t even budged 
3226 2018-08-08 18:17:13 Lmao buy beards oil from @Lamyy__ you be big boy
3227 2018-08-08 18:17:12 Shea butter and coconut oil
3228 2018-08-08 18:17:03 Juicy Fruit flavor CBD oil yummy
3229 2018-08-08 18:16:59 Easy.  They run out of oil
3230 2018-08-08 18:16:53 My mom has two artificial heart valves and a pacemaker. She called her open heart surgeries “valve jobs”, the blood transfusion she had to have with my sister an “oil change” and her pacemaker she calls her “alternator” which is actually kind of accurate. Lol
3231 2018-08-08 18:16:51 @WorldOil 

I feel one day may discover the formula for NEW + reproduction of different grades of Crude Oil in my Laboratory !!! 

Just a dream !. I woke up now. Smile.
3232 2018-08-08 18:16:50 If they have oil and gas US and allies must rally there to deliver freedom and democracy (obtain it otherwise China and Russia are winning this war)
3233 2018-08-08 18:16:43 Fully hydrogenated palm oil - the second ingredient - is concerning me a bit, I have to say ...

3235 2018-08-08 18:16:38 When expats leaves (once it tried but system econony fall) or alternate energy used it will be all over (brazil do not import oil) hence dubai changed into a different system not based on oil only but fibancial tourist IT based, but need expertise stop nonsense, gulf needs expats
3236 2018-08-08 18:16:36 We could stop giving national lands to oil companies for starters. Maybe stop denying the rest of our involvement in climate change? Also, pretty much anything that @barbarakesel has mentioned is spot on!
3237 2018-08-08 18:16:35 comes from one who was the part of extended planning commission,i.e NAC. Screwed handsomely their duty now selling snake oil as {yogendra is salim".
3238 2018-08-08 18:16:32 Stupid car needing repairs... gas... oil changes.. tires.... needy as fuck
3239 2018-08-08 18:16:29 Coconut oil
3240 2018-08-08 18:16:26 Graham sounding like a snake oil salesman again. Are you convinced about how much the saintly senator cares about "Iranian people?" It's laughable.
3241 2018-08-08 18:16:18 Well if you are someone with great research skills, you go for the MSc and you will get a job as long as you are good at what you do.

MBA is also really good to get if you want to work in a business environment including a bank or for oil companies over here.
3242 2018-08-08 18:16:16 Bit the North Sea is increasingly played out.  Salmond was criticised by oil experts at the referendum for double and triple accounting the scale of new finds. Even where potential new fields have been found, they are small and probably uneconomic to extract.
3243 2018-08-08 18:16:12 Oh and putting oil in my hair at night instead of the morning helped cut back my skin oil. Btwn that ave the vitamin c those things have helped with what you mentioned.
3244 2018-08-08 18:16:09 @POTUS  is this the squeaky wheel that gets the oil
3245 2018-08-08 18:16:00 All @Orioles gear @dickssportingss is buy one get one free. This is both happy and sad. Note:  Davis jerseys make great oil changing rags. . #Orioles #Birdland
3246 2018-08-08 18:15:58 Why would we be panicking? Saudi Arabia's main export is oil. We have our own oil.

We're also the ones who called them out on human rights. 

You MAGAs do love a good delusion.
3247 2018-08-08 18:15:58 Oh really, what aid is it getting? It literally gets less aid than oil and gas
3248 2018-08-08 18:15:57 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
3249 2018-08-08 18:15:56 Part of being an adult is getting excited about finding extra virgin olive oil at a great price 
3250 2018-08-08 18:15:44 Pourquoi repousse t'on le plan velo. Quel est le danger, qui fait pression ?
3251 2018-08-08 18:15:44 Add truffle oil to the mash just to make sure! 
3252 2018-08-08 18:15:34 I hate coconut oil in my coffee.
3253 2018-08-08 18:15:28 Jane Brody is a shill for Big Seed Oil. She should have retired decades ago.

3257 2018-08-08 18:15:11 When you walk out of the gym looking like you got dipped in oil is when you know you had a good lift
3258 2018-08-08 18:15:03 @jiffylube Your Valley Stream - Merrick Road location is extremely slow for inspection. In 1.25 hrs, 3 customers, that came after me, got oil changes done. Meanwhile, myself & another dude have been waiting for a simple inspection where you just hook up a computer pass or fail.
3259 2018-08-08 18:14:57 Two slices of zucchini, olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, a garlic clove I fried, and a baked potato, buttered, salted, peppered, and chives. My lunch earlier today. I need a hot drink, coffee time.
3260 2018-08-08 18:14:57 Ambitions? Some one that want free oil well is ambitious?

3263 2018-08-08 18:14:36 theres no oil in smash bros wtf
3264 2018-08-08 18:14:23 Saudis sell oil and salafist ideology.

3266 2018-08-08 18:14:05 We buy very little from SA , about 80 thousand barrels, we can get that from the US no problem. And if the US doesn’t, we stop oil at the Alberta , Canada border.
3267 2018-08-08 18:14:04 よっさんって誰やねん………
3268 2018-08-08 18:13:54 Oooh, black peppers! I haven't seen those
Your produce looks awesome
I'd probably do the same with baby aubergines as the big ones: slice lengthwise, rub with oil/garlic/herbs, squeeze lemon over, and roast
3269 2018-08-08 18:13:54 Hmm. I wonder if your theory accounts for what else oil is used (besides gasoline). E-cars are not a threat to oil/gas producers. It’s another opportunity.
3270 2018-08-08 18:13:48 Coconut oil is so underrated, I use it for EVERYTHING
3271 2018-08-08 18:13:41 There’s butter and coconut oil in my coffee. I don’t think I can really call it coffee at this point. Caffeinated sludge, maybe? #keto
3272 2018-08-08 18:13:40 Smells like oil would like this more than #northdakota C'mon Doug, why don't YOU remind US of our ND values for once...
3273 2018-08-08 18:13:36 So fucking sick of dingleberrys  if we're spending $ over there might as well take their oil
3274 2018-08-08 18:13:35 There's a lot here, but I think that the important part is the social and economic instability. Something like 85%+ of corporate profits from oil/gas resource extraction leaves the country. That's money that could be distributed in wages or in universal social programs.
3275 2018-08-08 18:13:30 Oh forget it, so Canada is buying Saudi oil and you are saying Trudeau is shaming Trump.  Do be real!!
3276 2018-08-08 18:13:16 Nt a makeup everyday kinda person but most breakouts are caused by a build up of oil. Oily foundations  Use a matte one with a good primer and proper skincare routine for removal

3278 2018-08-08 18:13:09 Oh no! She only supported a $15/he minimum wage, tuition free college, shutting down Great Lakes oil/gas pipeline, legalization, and independent redistricting. 

But you're right, she took money from people at a company her dad was an executive at.
3279 2018-08-08 18:13:09 Pouvez préciser et dater cette photo SVP.. car il y a 48h j’ai fait le plein en Espagne .. à Al Campo (Auchan Espagne) près de San Sebastian 1,19 le diesel normal ... j’ai connu à 0,95€ le litre de gas oil.. mais il y a plus d’un an!!
3280 2018-08-08 18:12:58 So while the media continues to squabble over Boris Johnsons comments, the pound has continued to fall against *every* other world currency - to the point where all imported goods - including oil, gas and food - literally overnight became 29% more expensive. #Brexitchaos #Boris
3281 2018-08-08 18:12:58 All clues lead Jessica to suspect angry businessman, played by Harold Sylvester . Weapon appears to be bottle of oil.

3283 2018-08-08 18:12:38 Yes! I really want to know more about his marijuana business. What is it now? Will it expand? New Jeffree Star Approved strains?  Pipes, papers and bongs?  edibles ?  dispensaries? A whole  line of beauty products with THC oil?
3284 2018-08-08 18:12:36 Low oil level as measured using the dip stick.
3285 2018-08-08 18:12:14 @DrGundry You say you're suspicious about coconut oil maybe being bad for people with the Alzheimer's gene. What about coconut cream/milk/meat/yogurt? Are they ok?
3286 2018-08-08 18:12:12 Arabs came in caravans in 1960s to India which I saw; when oil discovered many went with them, where advisors for illiterate but tolerant arabs, and developed desert into dream lands. I know an 95yr old who landed in 1947 a friend of kuwait sheikh. Its not a one way.
3287 2018-08-08 18:12:11 Y’all always asking me my makeup routine so here is goes... lash extensions + Coconut oil as my moisturizer + lipgloss... that’s it
3288 2018-08-08 18:12:03 I made a very clear point in response to the laughable charge of gigantic ego coming from a member of one of the most arrogant nations on the face of the earth.

And Canadians aren't apologetic about being eternally scornful to despots and oil goons.
3289 2018-08-08 18:11:59 Game slicker then car oil 
3290 2018-08-08 18:11:58 The only thing Trudeau should apologize for is NOT getting Energy East started .....  we don't need their oil..
3291 2018-08-08 18:11:55 Why you’re crying ?
We have oil and money, and governments like canada and others need us, we have to be stronger with those governments .
Saudi Arabia changed to be stronger.
3292 2018-08-08 18:11:54 I swear to God they need to make tea tree oil bottles more accessible. I just wasted so much ugh. it's either the bottle or I'm just a cluts.
3293 2018-08-08 18:11:49 I really don't get all this commotion about Alex Jones. He's just a humble fish oil salesman, can't we just leave him alone?!

3307 2018-08-08 18:10:22 You speak with forked tongue! Snake oil salesman.
3308 2018-08-08 18:10:22 Do some research. Trumps tariffs and oil/gas drilling off our coast will be his downfall. If/ when BMW closes it's plant in Greenville county or when tourism/ fishing industry or coastal property values are put in jeopardy,  affluent  Rep will (And have) vote blue

U honestly think our govt is going to do ANYTHING other than continue to worship the Saudi Regime and keep providing it with more bombs to kill more Yemenis?

3313 2018-08-08 18:09:54 TODAY I was getting my car inspected because I have a 14 hour road trip next week and when I picked it up the guy was like “yeah everything’s good, we changed your oil, changed the air filter...but why is there so much glitter in your back seat?” 
3314 2018-08-08 18:09:50 You can see it presented as a subtext in many reviews and guidelines written in the intervening decade. You assume it had no effect on sales of olive oil or nuts?

3320 2018-08-08 18:09:08 Uh huh. So, what you're saying is that you want extremist nations to institute unfair sanctions, and have major food retailers limit the amount of food sold, plus rely on an oil based monetary policy? Those are the issues with Venezuela, not socialism.

3331 2018-08-08 18:08:25 A day will arrive when humans will finally realize just how stupid they've been about everything but it'll be too late. Pollution, extinction, stripped resources, plastic-choked seas and fish, easy oil all gone, a planet not fit to live on anymore.
3332 2018-08-08 18:08:23 めっっっちゃよさそうだけど、今引っ越した直後でそんなお金ない…。
もっと安い椅子買って、年末あたりに買い替えとかかなあ…。
3333 2018-08-08 18:08:19 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
3334 2018-08-08 18:08:15 よっさん…誰や
3335 2018-08-08 18:08:13 two things. Changing trucking regs through a renegotiated NAFTA to ensure all transport in NA will be done with trucks going loaded both ways. Running empty 50% is crazy.... Second step, stop transporting oil by rail through cities, and finish the pipeline.
3336 2018-08-08 18:08:13 Oil is a limited resource...
3337 2018-08-08 18:08:11 You can... you can put an oil on it right?
3338 2018-08-08 18:08:09 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
3339 2018-08-08 18:08:06 Smoked my first oil pen the other day.... and I’m in love. It’s just so classy . 
3340 2018-08-08 18:08:05 If you are keeping score Saudi Arabia has withdrawn all investment and hundreds of millions in annual revenue from Canada & we will still buy their dirty oil in return as it unloads at Irving Terminals. 

Basically Saudi Arabia kicked Trudeau's ass and the world order knows it.
3341 2018-08-08 18:08:03 That tea tree oil is not for play play...
3342 2018-08-08 18:07:59 Oil molecules are hydrophobic, so the water doesn't mix with the oil, so it would have to be no.
3343 2018-08-08 18:07:57 Added some APC yesterday, felt like I’ve been waiting months to get a good entry point in.  Undeterred (so far) by oil bloodbath.
3344 2018-08-08 18:07:54 Must have been somehow related to that thing you check your oil with #dipstick
3345 2018-08-08 18:07:53 Does anyone but me notice that Trump is not putting sanctions of oil in effect until after the midterms?  He too needs Iran oil so gasoline prices don't go up before the election.
3346 2018-08-08 18:07:49 if you have a male friend who works on cars ask him to take time out to teach you the basics. Oil change, how to change a tire, or brakes etc
3347 2018-08-08 18:07:45 Perhaps rather than grovelling the Canadian government should stop accepting Saudi oil?
3348 2018-08-08 18:07:45 And that is just another example of strong leadership from President Trump in threatening both the Nord Stream pipeline and future Nord Stream II pipeline.  This threatens Putin's only true revenue stream. Thankfully President Trump has allowed for exporting domestic oil & gas.
3349 2018-08-08 18:07:42 Applying castor oil on my lashes & eyebrows every night in the hopes that they grow longer covering all my face so that nobody can recognise me.
3350 2018-08-08 18:07:35 Says shorts are nazis, calls a person a chimp and another pedo, supports a party that supports big oil, list goes on
3351 2018-08-08 18:07:30 I think this threat is nothing more than it is! The picture of the plane about too hit the CN tower explains the mental idiots we’re dealing with. Of course our politicians will bargain forgiveness now that our university and hospitals are financially punished watch Oil lol
3352 2018-08-08 18:07:25 Does any politician in Ott or QC object to using Saudi oil instead of Canadian? Nope. Buying their oil supports their regime. These politicians could care less about human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. If they did EE would be under construction by now.
3353 2018-08-08 18:07:17 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

3356 2018-08-08 18:07:15 I know my breaks bad but but i only came for a oil change hoe .
3357 2018-08-08 18:07:11 Unless Quebec has oil wells, we Liberals arent interested hearing about Canadial oil
3358 2018-08-08 18:07:09 @realDonaldTrump Why is the US supporting Al-Qaida terrorists?  I thought you be tough on terrorists.  Peace and Prosperity will make America great again.  Thanks again for giving all my tax cuts to Big Oil.

3360 2018-08-08 18:07:00 Do you know the difference between Heavy oil and WTI? What's the typical differential between WCS & WTI in USD?What about keystone running at 80%?Basically you dumbed this down to take no supply and demand, differences in type, or any differentiation to fit your narrative.
3361 2018-08-08 18:07:00 Yeah. Whatever. The US is owned by Big Oil. Don’t expect our government to do anything but suck Saudi Arabia’s dick and continue to provide them with armaments so they can starve more Yemenis. 
3362 2018-08-08 18:07:00 so @JustinTrudeau  what's next , you going to build that fruggen pipeline to save Canadians and start to open a few new refinery's so wr are not dependant on other countries like Saudi Arabia, come on there is more oil in Canada than Saudi , and think about thr grain farmers
3363 2018-08-08 18:06:59 took my car to get an oil change and they tell me she’s on her death bed
3364 2018-08-08 18:06:56 Depends on reason for drop. If it a structural demand driven drop in price, your scenario does not play out.  If the drop spurs demand, while reducing structural future supply, you're right.
3365 2018-08-08 18:06:46 4inches of Sun shield probably on 3x9.
3366 2018-08-08 18:06:45 Well, thanks for that. I'm never really sure what the point of that is, and I have no solid idea for how an olive looks. Most are really quite green when picked and brined, oil olives excepted. Unless I'm trying to write something cliche-ridden on purpose, I avoid writing that.
3367 2018-08-08 18:06:44 Yea Jack, I can name Environmental Damage! NOV 16 2017,   210,000 gallons Keystone oil, Amherest, South Dakota. 42 Tanker Trucks! YA TOOL !!
3368 2018-08-08 18:06:41 That means India bowed down in front of USA n didn't care for its own Oil interest ?
3369 2018-08-08 18:06:35 My mom most be pretty high profile here in Janesville, cause I can’t even go get an oil change without them saying “oh, you’re the judges kid” after giving them my last name. I’m afraid one of these days it’s gonna get messy.

3372 2018-08-08 18:06:24 Amazon ain’t ship my oil diffuser out yet, ima slap Bezos up
3373 2018-08-08 18:06:20 SA suspending wheat and barley imports from Canada, when are they going to stop with the export of their oil  to Canada??? ... waiting... @CBCPolitics
3374 2018-08-08 18:06:17 That looks like it's either:
1) An oil mark. Look for a good soap and scrub carefully
2) Dye seeped out. Not much you can do there.
3375 2018-08-08 18:06:13 Wouldn't it be nice if just for once one of the conglomerates announced a price decrease - with all their profits surely it should be possible.  Seems always goes up but never down when oil price drops. one day theypll price themselves out of existence
3376 2018-08-08 18:06:12 You haven't run out of snake oil yet?
3377 2018-08-08 18:06:09 This CLOWN PRINCE is only 33 years old and a billionaire.... spoiled loser and they have 12000 more princes????

Me, allergic to coconut: I am a pufferfish.


3380 2018-08-08 18:05:47 Awe! At least some of you are better.  did you ever try the peppermint oil yet?
3381 2018-08-08 18:05:44 Ahhhhh, big oil, big money, big corruption. Politicians appear powerless in the face of it. Taxpayers must always pick up the tab.
3382 2018-08-08 18:05:40 Trump doesn’t believe in allies. Only in pressuring others into partnerships. Saudi crude taps to Canada shut off yet? He will be “winning” no matter how we fill the gap for oil. And, of course, human rights have no part in his equations
3383 2018-08-08 18:05:30 Shale really needs those Chinese buyers to come back" TRUE but... wonder how that fits with Xi's notion of slapping tariffs galore on China's imports of US shale oil and gas...

3387 2018-08-08 18:05:11 @beautyandplanet apologies if I missed it on your site, but I couldn't find anything about palm oil. Do your products use palm oil or palm oil derivatives?? Thanks!
3388 2018-08-08 18:05:10 A snake oil salesman sat in Trump Towers, too, and would still be there, but for some Russian election interference.  No one can claim surprise at what we got-
3389 2018-08-08 18:05:05 おいしいの？
3390 2018-08-08 18:04:56 There is nothing they will do in service of that truth bc they made the decision that oil money's more important to them a LONG time ago & every time someone points out how bad it's gotten they dig in more. Future generations will suffer for that, assuming they last long enough.
3391 2018-08-08 18:04:49 كل اللي مسويني فولو هاليومين كل حسابات  homemade local tanning oil !

3392 2018-08-08 18:04:49 Saudi is getting rid of foreign workers by this Sept. and since no Saudis work as they all live off oil any refugees will be needed for the service industry as the work is beneath Saudis.
3393 2018-08-08 18:04:37 Who also needs oil when your power grid is transitioning to Solarcity, a Tesla company!
3394 2018-08-08 18:04:31 So what IS the definition of a monopoly then? AT&T and Standard Oil weren't the ONLY providers of oil and telecoms, it's just that they were the only practical choice in most markets. Same with YouTube.
3395 2018-08-08 18:04:28 Shouldn’t the oil companies be charged for the decommissioning process, perhaps stringent policies on the WM governments side can ensure that the taxpayer won’t have to pay these costs
3396 2018-08-08 18:04:27 I hear ya! Im aggravated every freakin day bc of thisoil salesman. All this tRump cannot be good for our health. Its just so stressful. Every day when I wake up, the first thing I think of is what did that asshole do now? I don't want to live in fear. Hes violating OUR rights
3397 2018-08-08 18:04:27 In the same news Dawn reported about the big cache of oil reserves. Was that true?
3398 2018-08-08 18:04:27 Is the Middle East in a mess?  Yes. Is it all because of the world powers and their desire for oil?  Hardly. If that were true, we would never have turned Iraq back over to the provisional government and its people.
3399 2018-08-08 18:04:13 And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
3400 2018-08-08 18:03:51 The end result is a delectable, sumptuous olive oil with a distinctive citrus zest that you can feel great about enjoying yourself and sharing with those you love.  #Vervana #VervanaMarket #OliveOil #ColdPressed #FlavoredOliveOil #Salad #SaladDressing #CookingAtHome
3401 2018-08-08 18:03:49 Today's price action alone tells you Musk is, as usual, full of banana oil. If the deal made any sense it would be trading at 400+ with a floor in at the previous highs.
3402 2018-08-08 18:03:48 Then why the pipeline? Why the expansion of the oil sands? Why the subsidies to O&G?
3403 2018-08-08 18:03:38  actually, kind of. Canada just bought a pipeline to meet a trade agreement with China. China just cut Saudi oil orders.

I’m sure it’s entirely due to Freeland saying “immediate” though. 
3404 2018-08-08 18:03:23 I use all of my AP I can't farming oil to have exp cards ;w;
3405 2018-08-08 18:03:20 Electric cars were being developed and built in the 1800's nearly all of them privately done. 
Government investment in the oil industry went a long way in killing that from becoming a mass market.
3406 2018-08-08 18:03:15 This #coldpressed flavored olive oil will delight your #tastebuds AND #nourish your body! I hand-selected this product due to the vibrational quality of the ingredients.

3412 2018-08-08 18:02:16 the world is a better place without Saudi shit, let them sink in their own damn oil
3413 2018-08-08 18:02:16 I know one, with hundreds of millions, who is very happy. He was a hard working boat captain before his money came in (oil). He never changed. Love him.
3414 2018-08-08 18:02:15 Due respect, snake oil salesman doesn’t quite cover it.
3415 2018-08-08 18:02:01 En tout cas il me semblait qu il flirtait avec les théories du Peak oil a l époque
3416 2018-08-08 18:01:57 Ah, yes, I understand! Luckily my 'trying to get fit' bike is newish so everything tight! My prob is getting oil & grease on my hands which is impossible to remove if I'm going to be taking a service a few hours later. Any other time it comes off a treat

3426 2018-08-08 18:01:21 U.S. oil falls to 7-week low as EIA reports crude inventory draw down of 1.3M barrels was less than expected. China puts a 25% tariff on U.S oil.
3427 2018-08-08 18:01:16 Who needs oil when you own 2.5% of an electric car company 
3428 2018-08-08 18:01:11 I think it looks good. I’m also a sucker for laminate stocks.

3432 2018-08-08 18:00:43 ...and another thing. I’m so glad you’ve all finally discovered that burning a finite resource like oil to produce a bag for you to use once before letting it pollute the planet for half a million years is bad but I don’t need to see you virtue signaling about it, ok?
3433 2018-08-08 18:00:40 I am concerned about global overpopulation, in the 1800's there was 1 billion people, currently we have 7.5 billion people & growing.

Financially,  US has the highest debt at 14.6 trillion. I wish the Republicans and the Democrats would burn some Midnight Oil on this matter.
3434 2018-08-08 18:00:39 Those complaining about sodium.  If Bragg's is used then there is only 1131 mg. of sodium in WHOLE recipe (cup based on the olive oil). There is 16 T in a cup. Therefore only 70 mg of sodium per T.  Avg adjult only uses about 2 T in a salad that's only 140 mg.  Ranch? 325 per T.

3445 2018-08-08 17:59:43 If it goes down, the investment in oil will be delayed and when there will be a shortage in supply the prices will skyrocket. Going down is bullish on long term perspective
3446 2018-08-08 17:59:32 Get some cocoa butter or coconut oil boo!
3447 2018-08-08 17:59:26 4. get a lot sicker and need to obtain very expensive hospital care.  Pollution from coal and oil increases health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.

3450 2018-08-08 17:59:00 Hot oil treat: coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, caster oil, neem oil, carrot seed oil, rose essential oil. Just get an oil applicator pour the oil, heat up some water in a bowl let the oil sit so it can warm up and apply to scalp and hair 5 -15 mins, wash out after.
3451 2018-08-08 17:58:59 Oil change taking FOREVER!
3452 2018-08-08 17:58:46 Wow this is very alarming. I have never diffused tea tree oil (aka melaleuca) but I have it and will remember to keep it away from the pets. I asked my oil girl for a list of oils that are unhealthy for pets and shared this with Rose our groomer. Thank you!!

3454 2018-08-08 17:58:40 Agree with you. Canadians should understand country of origin of oil and gasoline products.

3456 2018-08-08 17:58:32 We are only club being sensible.  When oil barons get bored, TV money runs out all the other 19 teams go bust we will dominate football for years to come.
3457 2018-08-08 17:58:19 I don't really understand why an oil spill in the ocean starts an immediate reaction with multi governments sometimes to clean it up and millions in funding but 10 million tons plastic and garbage in the ocean it's like k here's a knife, a net and 20$ save a turtle. #pollution
3458 2018-08-08 17:58:13 Once the oil is gone, this attitude will also be gone!!
3459 2018-08-08 17:58:09 On the contrary. In fact I would add to it. They want to play this game? Stop all importations of goods. That's 1.5 billion a year. Then set up with the US the differential needed for oil in eastern Canada. Stop all oil imports from Saudi Arabia. Done
3460 2018-08-08 17:58:05 Continental Resources sees 15-20 pct output growth in 2019, focus on oil

You like that?

3467 2018-08-08 17:57:26 So true. The Saudis are living in bizarro-world and should be identified as such. Without oil money they'd be still roaming around the desert.
3468 2018-08-08 17:57:21 That's not to imply current price band of oil has no effect: after all, running costs of new EV for consumers and e-buses for municipalities advertise myriad attractive qualities even to the layman's eye. My point: marginal barrel calcs no longer key to this equation.
3469 2018-08-08 17:57:14 Possibly oil has been leaked. Engine is heading towards failure and making noise. It needs to inject engine oil ASAP 
3470 2018-08-08 17:57:00 (1) Can you provide examples of a Canadian oil company doing this? I'd like specific referenceable cases, not recycled talking points. On the other hand, groups like the Rockefeller foundation have spent Millions

3472 2018-08-08 17:56:49 More concrete examples re: economy: restraunts, barbers, mechanics, grocery stores etc. are all very tightly bound to oil prices. This kind of economic instability can lead directly to social instability.

3474 2018-08-08 17:56:33 Those attacks have existed for years due to the influence of the coal and oil lobbies. Hell, even Hillary Clinton was touting the potential of "clean coal". Again, none of that is new.

3483 2018-08-08 17:55:42 THIS is a wake up call to immediately move from fossil fuel consumption.  Read the science, experience the heat wave, man....this shit is getting real, real fast...and oil is the enemy and it is not the people in science, or the environmentalists or the indigenous.

3489 2018-08-08 17:54:58 (Returning to twitter after long holiday). IMO, only oil prices at the extremes (say, $30 and $100) could now meaningfully affect what appears to be unfolding without regard to current prices: EV adoption rate (actually all electrics) proceeding regardless. 1/2

3508 2018-08-08 17:53:29 Any raw honey will keep bacteria at bay, but manuka needs to have a UMF of 16+ to be worth the extra money. I snipped vit E capsules open & dripped the oil on wounds -very good for new formation of healthy skin 
3509 2018-08-08 17:53:27 Let this van be a symbol of our returning to the past to make America great again! The coal mines are ramping up. Next we should put whale oil lamps in our streets!
3510 2018-08-08 17:53:27 The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 
So we can stop importing Saudi Oil ASAP!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.

3512 2018-08-08 17:52:47 Unpopular opinion: I prefer Sonic 1 and CD over Sonic 2. While the later has some noticeable improvements and truly cemented Sonic's feel and aesthetic, there are some Zones which I just can't stand (Oil Ocean, Metropolis). Yes, I have no problem with Marble or Wacky Workbench ;P
3513 2018-08-08 17:52:46 6. All own goals
3514 2018-08-08 17:52:46 Seems like that could work! The amount of oil isn't really set, just enough to keep things nice and submerged.
3515 2018-08-08 17:52:44 Oil down -3,5%  / 66,61$
3516 2018-08-08 17:52:42 I also make sure its the best Olive Oil I can afford...cold extraction and unfiltered and naturally extra virgin. Delish!

3519 2018-08-08 17:52:18 The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later.

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.....and closing our borders would help as well!
3520 2018-08-08 17:51:58 Oil price goes up, Russia is the first to benefit
3521 2018-08-08 17:51:53 That's why SA has gotten away with murder for decades. Oil=$=power.
3522 2018-08-08 17:51:50 Patti you sound like Trump "Massive exports"! Don't you read EIA annual reports? Annual Production 3.2 Billion bbls: proven and probable reserves 31 Billion. Do the math, thats 10yrs of oil left. Same on Nat Gas side> 10 yrs remaining.  Please do research.
3523 2018-08-08 17:51:45 I think you get to not always be on hyper alert for a problem. Having a relaxing time with family will probably do more for your feminism in the long run than whether or not you shave. Offer up the itching as it grows back as your penence. ;) 
No, don’t. Oil helps, I hear.
3524 2018-08-08 17:51:24 How do I fry it? Pan on olive oil?
3525 2018-08-08 17:51:22 If we had Energy East ready to go , replacing Saudi imports with Alberta oil would be easy and good for the whole country
3526 2018-08-08 17:51:05 can bio oil fix my life?
3527 2018-08-08 17:51:02 Voting can be fixed by an amazing technology developed 100 years ago - called Proportional Representation. Anything else is snake oil.
3528 2018-08-08 17:50:59 I don't usually go read Rolling Stone to read about oil. I can't even critique their figures unless I review the work they cite @Cedders68
3529 2018-08-08 17:50:57 Buy US refinery stocks and short Canadian oil sand stocks would be an ideal paired trade.

3535 2018-08-08 17:50:19 Log them, graze them or watch them burn. We import all of our lumber from Canada then ship it all over America. With the amount of fuel it takes to ship all this Lumber and the fuel it takes to fight forest fires. How many oil wells have to be drilled in fraced to support this?
3536 2018-08-08 17:50:16 Well - if that’s how you like it, you’d best strip and bend over and I’ll fetch the olive oil drizzler 
3537 2018-08-08 17:50:14 That's very true, even the exit next to National oil from Town is poorly done, a classic example of engineering gone wrong, Hapo drivers watagonga ukuta

3539 2018-08-08 17:49:50 Donny did and would not like to have oil above 70 for his election reasons.  Oil market is behaving as such.
3540 2018-08-08 17:49:43 The magic you can make with pasta, olive oil, garlic, and a dash of sliced onions and peppers.
3541 2018-08-08 17:49:36 I had a consulting client pulling in close to $200k in Alaskan oil fields as an electrician. He'll be FIREd in his 30's w/o college (at least college isn't required). Amazing and kudos to that dude!
3542 2018-08-08 17:49:32 Lavender is also my favorite essential oil, body wash scent, go to candle, lavender ice cream is actually kind of dope. 

I also look good in purple. Lol
3543 2018-08-08 17:49:31 No. China will be getting more oil from Iran as will Russia. Now that they don't have to compete with the United States they can get it cheaper. See how that works? You can thank the Pretend President for that!
3544 2018-08-08 17:49:20 All the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. So that we can stop importing any Saudi Oil ASAP!!
3545 2018-08-08 17:49:18 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
3546 2018-08-08 17:49:11 Its because demand for oil is going away due to alt energy, and their source of income with it. Soon they will be a broke, angry mob searching for resources because they cant provide their own.
Beware!
3547 2018-08-08 17:48:58 Right now the market is doing an oil de-risking on the back of people panicking over potential lower demand. And it looks like there were too many spec longs. Hard to see where this stops. No one cares about Cushing at the moment.
3548 2018-08-08 17:48:55 Try it with the hot chili oil, it's soooooo much worse hahahaha
3549 2018-08-08 17:48:52 obviously the house of saude is intimidated by something, maybe us getting more oil to tide water and that eating into the only real influence they have on the world stage, their ability to control oil prices and subsequent geopolitical mechanizations in world politics.
3550 2018-08-08 17:48:50 The WORLD price of oil will determine the future.. MY ENERGY JUST CAME FROM MY BACON AND EGG SAMICH I JUST HAD
3551 2018-08-08 17:48:49 F them and the camel they rode in on.

We have plenty of oil at home.

3559 2018-08-08 17:48:15 I’m out getting an oil change and mykids call to very politely say, “We demand ice cream mochis!” Since this was their exact phrasing, I decided to text them a photo of Mommy enjoying an ice cream mochi. No manners, no mochi.

3564 2018-08-08 17:47:41 i got oil on my fucking fingers 
3565 2018-08-08 17:47:36 If they were actually serious and stopped importing Saudi oil and treated Iran the same perhaps I would but this looks like another ploy to get votes. Stop the armoured vehicles and stop Bombardier from selling planes to Iran. Then I may take them serious.
3566 2018-08-08 17:47:33 For the same reason that if you complain about big oil, you cannot own a car, computer, phone or anything else made of plastic. 
For the same reason, that if you complain about capitalism, you should move to a socialist country.

3577 2018-08-08 17:46:05 Building a new platform is a long game, and it's one we need to play, but it doesn't help things now. It's like drilling for oil because of high gas prices. It's a good idea, but you need to do other things to fix the current situation you're in.

3582 2018-08-08 17:45:53 That should go GREAT with the increased gas + oil prices from screwing Iran (not to mention our allies that are still rightfully honoring the deal).
3583 2018-08-08 17:45:48 All war needs to end if we are to f**king evolve. Armys are better @ building stuff than destroying stuff.

3584 2018-08-08 17:45:46 It's basically a locket with a felt pad inside. You soak the felt with your oil of choice and it diffuses through the openings in the locket. I don't remember where I got this one, but you can find them on Amazon.

3586 2018-08-08 17:45:27 Look at natural gas prices. We’re barely getting $0.30 on the dollar. Unfortunately natural gas prices don’t grab headlines like oil prices do.

3589 2018-08-08 17:45:08 The saudis are CLEARLY using their oil money to buy ownership in TSLA so they can sabotage the electric vehicle market as it threatens the need for oil in the future. Or maybe the saudis just want to diversify their reliance on oil..

3597 2018-08-08 17:43:33 Your purpose is to love God first in every way possible
Stay strong
Ever try CBD oil?
Helps my pain a smidge
3598 2018-08-08 17:43:28 Excellent article. But at $70/barrel, isn't a $.08 price (or more) impact of CA "keep it in the ground" just a rounding error in oil supply/demand? Fracking is expanding fast at $70, Saudi/Russia have swing capacity, while downside gyrations from Iran, Ven Mex etc dwarf CA effect
3599 2018-08-08 17:43:26 Another Italian. How about going to Eastern Europe for inspiration? (your restaurant in Budapest... italian ).How about finding out why your Hungarian goulash recipe is such an utter disaster. Plain combinations can be cool without overdosing Vinegar rosemary olive oil & chilli
3600 2018-08-08 17:43:24 Ah little Luke is piping up. I've seen my club win everything in the game, a global giant. You lot are Wigan with oil money.
We have your number, must be sickening we beat you everytime we meet. What is it again? 1 win at Anfield in 20 years, can see why we worry you so much.
3601 2018-08-08 17:43:19 Dead ass Ima start taking my car to Valentino to change my oil  he wouldn’t charge me anything ):

3604 2018-08-08 17:43:08 Yes, but it's Trump Snake Oil, which is mixed into a a $35 Trumptini at the shitty Trump hotel of your choice. Guaranteed to give erections to obese old men, no doubt.
3605 2018-08-08 17:43:02 @ajmaljami sir i m an oil industry professional having 12 years of experience in field. This news is totally misinterpreted. This is not the case. Beleive me ppl of our industry are shocked of this naivety. 0333 3355752 my cell. U can call me anytime i ll tell u truth. Stay blesd
3606 2018-08-08 17:43:00 Eh tp untuk muka deng ya? Kalo olive oil dah dicoba sist?
3607 2018-08-08 17:43:00 But cost of living is going up as well because of healthcare sabotage by trump, oil prices, and cost of goods from stupid tariffs. #taxscam raising deficits so we will have to pay for that sooner or later.  Also the looming cuts in SS/Medicare means you better save more.
3608 2018-08-08 17:42:47 @BedBathBeyond your car vent oil has spilled out and damaged the plastic vent area. The most difficult product poor direction and the oil melted my car plastic.
3609 2018-08-08 17:42:38 Thats what i said. I got lucky and closed my eye right as it happened, and was able to build up a tear strong enough to flush the oil. Was a cyclops for 10 minutes though, was aight
3610 2018-08-08 17:42:29 That moment when you go get an oil change and your service rep comes to tell you that you need a couple other things done, but they aren’t a big deal. Then says the total for those couple other things is $720 
3611 2018-08-08 17:42:28 let's see how they will face the economy when the oil plummet. hope they prepare their pockets money. wuhuu
3612 2018-08-08 17:42:16 Lets look at how a decrease in Saudi oil availability in eastern Canada might be a spur to converting to greener resources
3613 2018-08-08 17:42:12 We haven't laid a km of pipe since #Harper left... we may be able to replace #Saudi oil, but not with #Canadian oil...
3614 2018-08-08 17:42:07 China imposes 25% tariffs on $16 Billion worth of U.S. goods - oil and cars!
3615 2018-08-08 17:41:50 Being realistic the Glazer Siblings are the whole board. The others are merely a public front- like Corleone’s olive oil shop.
3616 2018-08-08 17:41:50 Probably too much to attempt to unpack in a tweet, but Alberta has a significant transient population that rises and falls with oil prices. Makes infrastructure planning difficult (ex: schools, roads, hospitals, etc) and sends shockwaves though the provincial economy.
3617 2018-08-08 17:41:45 Cbd oil.
3618 2018-08-08 17:41:42 I need to go get this oil change before i make this drive and quit playing.
3619 2018-08-08 17:41:39 Ah... crude oil... my friend... are we going to do this, this time? For real? Maybe?
3620 2018-08-08 17:41:35 わわわほんとですか……！？ありがとうございます
じつはわたしも昨日の性癖語り然りすごい趣味が合うのでは？とおもっていまして…！
3621 2018-08-08 17:41:21 Countries should just stop buying oil from them and let them return to the shithole state they were in before the west started trading with them.
3622 2018-08-08 17:41:15 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party maybe consider stopping all imports of oil from Saudi Arabia at Brent pricing and supply, through energy east, from AB, Sask, BC at a discounted WTI? Seems like a no brainer from a social/political/monetary standpoint?

Large oil companies buying up a newly invented formula for clean alternative fuel.
Scientist who invented it is crucified in the media.

3631 2018-08-08 17:40:09 Yes sold some dow 614  seeing oil! Will throw it out if we can’t break 550 by the close
3632 2018-08-08 17:40:06 I’ll try to oil my ass up ahead of time and end up crackin a lil joke and plop down on my couch, laughing at myself and end up with permanent buttcheek shaped oil stains on that shit
3633 2018-08-08 17:40:00 THATS BC YO ASS AINT WANNA USE TEA TREE OIL
3634 2018-08-08 17:39:55 @KSAmofaEN A barbaric country ruled by uncivilized, pseudo-religious hypocrites, whose primary export to the world is not oil but extremism, is throwing a hissy fit like an enraged toddler over spilled milk. How embarrassed their citizens must be of their petulance. #saudicanada
3635 2018-08-08 17:39:44 Another idiot. They have campaigns against illegal fishing, whaling in Iceland, dolphin hunting in the Faroe Islands, oil drilling in the GAB, sea turtle poaching, salmon farming, and cetacean bycatch.
3636 2018-08-08 17:39:42 @Beccambristow can you do a video on how to clean an oil diffuser?

3640 2018-08-08 17:39:16 Just found out my car has an oil leak in the gasket. Its $300 to get fixed . Lord save me
3641 2018-08-08 17:39:16 that happened to me!! piercing it with a hoop makes it easier to get irritated, but no worries you’ll be okay:-) just keep using tea tree oil and doing sea salt soaks, wash with a gentle soap (i have recs i can send u) & just do not play with it/twist it
3642 2018-08-08 17:39:10 I think they also own the oil fields.
3643 2018-08-08 17:39:09 Can’t wait for the day an old relative finds oil on their property so I dress up as an evil plant to scare retro teens away from the house.
3644 2018-08-08 17:39:05 Released! If he can’t pay to clean it up, local tax payers will and it’s not cheap! This moron could have sold this oil to a bio fuel company.
Apparently he’s not only clueless regarding the damage he caused to the environment, but he didn’t realize he was sitting on $. Sickening

I challenge you, no, don't look on wiki, name one. They have the goldmine of oil but violence is in their blood, I won't be fooled.

3656 2018-08-08 17:38:18 This is a joke. Government pressuring private companies to make less $. Why don’t they go after the oil and gas companies, that would make a real difference for citizens.
3657 2018-08-08 17:38:05 Tjmaxx is a trap. Went for tea tree oil and makeup removed wipes and left with $70 worth of other stuff I didnt need 
3658 2018-08-08 17:37:56 There’s probably oil underneath it.
3659 2018-08-08 17:37:46 do you know how to add oil, steering fluid, coolant, wiper fluid?

3663 2018-08-08 17:37:12 So let me understand you- I haveno right to demand a paradigm shift frm the nation’s suicidal dependency & market dominance on oil & gasenergy unless I make a full recitation 2 u of my bona fides? I am a citizen in afossil fuel sacrifice zone. ‘Nuff said. Good day.Good luck.
3664 2018-08-08 17:37:06 Damn and I just got my oil changed 
3665 2018-08-08 17:37:04 Oil prices slid almost 4 percent on Wednesday as a trade dispute between the United States and China escalated further and after Chinese import data showed a slowdown in energy demand.
3666 2018-08-08 17:37:03 MSM is all ahoy now for pipelines to counter SA oil imports. Never said one damn word when Trudeau was fking up Energy East for Denis Coderre & to save Lib seats in Que. Same when he cancelled Northern Gateway because he didn't want PMSH to get the credit.
#Chickens #Roost

3667 2018-08-08 17:36:59 @dale_hoogs the best response is building refineries and refining Canadian oil instead of exporting it.
3668 2018-08-08 17:36:54 and they think they were for human rights in Iraq and Libya as part of NATO.....they killed thousands on the name of human rights but was just for oil...
3669 2018-08-08 17:36:45 all I want for my birthday is a little getaway, shaved legs, baby oil for that glow, a pool/ocean and my King. I trust he's going to make it happen! #submit
3670 2018-08-08 17:36:31 If you have a food processor, it is the easiest thing. You through in peanuts, peanut oil, salt, and whatever flavors you want and hit the button. Once I learned how easy it is I thought store-bought peanut butter is the biggest scam in the world.
3671 2018-08-08 17:36:28 I need coffee. Or a red bull. Or holy oil. Or a blessing. #exhausted
3672 2018-08-08 17:36:27 The main objection oil is “Raw bitumen” to development of pipeline infrastructure. I think we can agree the 1 billion grant isn’t enough. We need to champion upgraders enough to get economics right through the next 10 years as we transition to green tech. #abgov #cdnpoli #abpoli
3673 2018-08-08 17:36:22 Who benefited from 9/11 most?  Saudi Arabia, Russia, military industrial complex, oil industry... @krassenstein @TeaPainUSA @activist360 @nmschaffer @selectedwisdom @MalcolmNance @maddow @CNN @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @FoxNews @AnnCoulter @RandPaul
3674 2018-08-08 17:36:21 Oil prices like back off 3-5% during Week1 of sept. as inventory builds from end of summer driving season.

Shorting Oil not good idea, with black swans looming. Next move up could be sustained for multi-year cycle.
3675 2018-08-08 17:36:18 Or alternatively, do not align yourself with a known misogynist like BS and then champion progressive credentials at the same time because they are as compatible as oil and water.
3676 2018-08-08 17:36:14 And yet, as opposed to Obama's feckless approach, Trump's weightier policies addressed Russia's Oil & Gas energy weapon over the EU, signed a $10 billion deal to place missile defense in Poland, addressed NATO defense shortfalls, and is sanctioning Russia, and its proxy, Iran.

3680 2018-08-08 17:35:49 Put some mineral oil in it maybe, I have tremendous wax problems and I oil my ears once a week or so and it helps a lot
3681 2018-08-08 17:35:40 Been wondering about that. My guess: When the US finally abandoned the gold standard in the 70s, & after the 1974 oil shock, it entered into an agreement with the Saudis to ensure oil was traded in US dollars. In return, USA must have agreed to back KSA's regional designs.
3682 2018-08-08 17:35:19 Do your research and try again.  A good start would be to look up how the CIA and Britain overthrew the democratically elected prime minister and installed a dictator in exchange for oil.  Go ahead, I'll wait.
3683 2018-08-08 17:35:10 Can you do a lower leg service (not sure this is even a thing on Fox) yourself- easy on RS. No need for new seals, just give the old ones a really good clean and get some of the right oil back in the lowers? Going to be worked hard at BPW...
3684 2018-08-08 17:35:08 Nothing so fancy, just thrown in a pan with some olive oil and added to a bowl of greens and tomatoes..

3686 2018-08-08 17:35:05 Really isn’t about theories, it’s about knowing and believing God’s Word in spite of the popular fables. He won’t come until after the time of great tribulation. The foolish virgins thought they would be fine because they started with oil and waited for the Bridegroom.
3687 2018-08-08 17:35:04 She needs a hot oil treatment asap
3688 2018-08-08 17:34:59 I'm sure it is residual from the BP oil spill.

3694 2018-08-08 17:34:13 1). Go to the gym
2). Start fasting
3). Sleep longer

3697 2018-08-08 17:34:02 Well, at least there’s a bit of diversity in some areas so that could be a hedge in case they decide to withhold the oil. 

Still, given how things are developing... welp, I don’t like where it’s going.

3710 2018-08-08 17:33:00 Better than what??? Wind farms are environmental nightmare. Killing hundreds of birds and bats. They also leak oil (imagine that! They need oil for lubrication, shocker ) not to mention the amount of metals and petroleum needed to create and install them. #facts
3711 2018-08-08 17:32:58 With respect......these people have made a career choice to invade foreign countries for oil money. Anything that happens is on then.
3712 2018-08-08 17:32:58 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub
3713 2018-08-08 17:32:54 Maybe the Saudis will recall all their extremist hate-spewing imams they've planted in CDN mosques. Maybe Canada could grow a spine and cut off Saudi oil. Quit stomping your heels Chrystia and return fire

3715 2018-08-08 17:32:45 Thought you were bright. Maybe your head banging might help. Oil revenue creates +ve foreign exchange= stable currency & +ve b.o.p. = confidence to invest in any gvt borrowing. Nothing to do with tax. Away n do some basic economic theory on how money flows.

3718 2018-08-08 17:32:32 I just shake, holding on to the lid. At that point I think steam more an issue than hot oil since you really only use enough oil for a thin coating on bottom of pan... Maybe an air popper instead?
3719 2018-08-08 17:32:06 Solid education you got there. Let’s see how well your country does when oil tails off and all you got is a 2000 year old book of nonsense to lead you. Adios homie

3724 2018-08-08 17:31:42 Does bio oil and/or cocoa butter really make that much if a difference for old scars and hyperpigmentation or whatever? Asking for a friend who's unsure what to order. A friend named Kate who's 100% just gonna rub it onto her dick where her dick already gets rubbed too much.
3725 2018-08-08 17:31:35 It was  Chili oil that used a lead pipe to break the multitool
3726 2018-08-08 17:31:33 He's just a shouty salesman. He harangues his listeners into submission, then gets them to buy his magic potions so they feel better after being verbally abused. Snake oil conman. And despicable human being, a total disgrace to our species.
3727 2018-08-08 17:31:29 Hard to swallow pill: fish oil pills them things are nasty.
3728 2018-08-08 17:31:22 My grandma put coconut oil inside the conditioner bottle and now my hair is greasy afffff and I’m running late to class, yay 
3729 2018-08-08 17:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.
3730 2018-08-08 17:30:57 They taking forever with my car for a oil change & car wash 
3731 2018-08-08 17:30:55 Yes wild growth and jamaican black castor oil together does wonders for me and my daughters hair.
3732 2018-08-08 17:30:54 You know the Mexican food is about to hit when it’s sold from a oil change shop. Quick Lube bringing the heat today.
3733 2018-08-08 17:30:54 i knew @curtisyuille had the vision when years ago we went to a hotel party & he saw Michael Jordan in a oil painting that was really a lake & swans

3735 2018-08-08 17:30:37 Thank you so much  I did using Painter 12. It's a great software that emulates oil painting, watercolor, etc...
3736 2018-08-08 17:30:34 I don't know what capitalism has to do with a nationalized oil industry. Or nationalized monetary system. Nor does that explain hyperinflation in every other socialist country in history. Or starvation in every other socialist country in history.

3741 2018-08-08 17:30:10 He's not a prophet 
he's a soothsayer.

he sells you snake oil to calm your fear of the unknown.

I understand being lost and scared and angry but letting those things get the best of you 
makes you weak.

Accepting reality is hard 
giving into someone's delusion is easy.
3742 2018-08-08 17:30:06 From tht decisioun in been in USA last forever oil drifts.
3743 2018-08-08 17:30:01 Yet he's for building the Mexican wall? What about the Mexican people's cries? Oh I get it...they don't have any oil to barter with ya, right Mr. Graham and Trump.
3744 2018-08-08 17:29:59 The punishment is unfortunately too mild. They should have been given a life term of hard labor in a North Siberian Oil Rig.
3745 2018-08-08 17:29:58 Yg pink tu untuk sensitive skin. Yg biru utk kulit berminyak. Aku pernah pakai tiga tiga tapi aku paling suka yg ada argan oil tu sbb dia mcm nourish skin hehe
3746 2018-08-08 17:29:55 But under his watch $25 Billion oil contract was executed without due process. Under his watch IGP failed to honour NASS invitation. Under his watch the executive failed to release Col. Sambo Dasuki even after several court Orderd.Under his watch the police protested in maiduguri
3747 2018-08-08 17:29:47 #Oil prices slid almost 4 percent on Wednesday as a trade dispute between the U.S.and China escalated further and after Chinese import data showed a slowdown in energy demand
Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $2.73 to $71.92 a barrel a 3.7 percent loss, by 12:33 p.m. EDT (1633 GMT)
3748 2018-08-08 17:29:36 if i break ur heart na oil spillage
3749 2018-08-08 17:29:31 Well, see, now you’re the racist one for pointing that out
3750 2018-08-08 17:29:27 I’d imagine washing them frequently is what’s causing the issue. Our skin secretes oil for a variety of biological purposes so it’s probably compensating when you wash it off.
3751 2018-08-08 17:29:27 I think about how the system is broken, and no longer represents the general pubic. Trump is just an actor, a snake oil salesman. The power is found with the ruling oligarchy; which is comprised of #DeepState and #WallStreet interests, and control both political parties.
3752 2018-08-08 17:29:15 I don't trade futures/derivatives. I only focus on Canadian equities, mostly the ones that are paying a dividend. If I have to wait for a higher oil price, I might as well get a dividend in the meantime.
3753 2018-08-08 17:29:14 @HeidsterTrades  Hi Heidi. I haven't been on Twitter for a long time. I think you might know CL_Princessa? I was following her crude oil trades but now it looks like she's been suspended. Is that permanent? 
I trade Emini S&P but it's so dead this August that i was thinking crude
3754 2018-08-08 17:29:07 It's not a matter of if, but when the Saudi people will be liberated. Freedom wins, period. You guys are north korea with oil money  let us know when you graduate from the stone age 
3755 2018-08-08 17:28:53 2 words. Fish oil.
3756 2018-08-08 17:28:52 oh no! Do you have Vicks Vaporub anywhere around? I find that and eucalyptus oil help ease my system when my asthma flares up xx
3757 2018-08-08 17:28:45 I forgot my olive oil and lemon today for lunch, I drizzle them over my food daily. So, my salad, chicken and rice was dry and I was pissed. Annoyed with morning Christy.
3758 2018-08-08 17:28:39 Yeah I've tried that ... But I turn it upside down (iirc) and definitely shake it a lot ... Hot oil and a toddler seems a bad combination. Hoping to find something Emmy could help with in a few years too, before she could hold the lid on a pot.
3759 2018-08-08 17:28:24 The ‘Shwe' (meaning ‘golden') projects entail exploitation of underwater natural gas deposits off the coast of western Burma's Arakan State and dual oil and gas pipelines that will transport this gas along with oil imports from Africa and the Middle East, to southwest China.
3760 2018-08-08 17:28:22 Believe in cannabis for wellness? The National Day Calendar has declared today National CBD (cannabidiol) Day. NC-based oil co., CBD Oil, chosen as the official sponsor.

3762 2018-08-08 17:28:20 Wow that was the quickest oil change I’ve ever gotten
3763 2018-08-08 17:28:00 Of course when I go get my oil changed it’s an hour or longer wait 
3764 2018-08-08 17:27:58 A girl who worked for me lived in Egypt for a year (b/c her dad worked for an oil company) when she was about 8-9 years old She was in a car with her mum and sister, all 3 are blond. Car is surrounded by Muslim men and they all start masturbating. Utter sick degenerate fucks.
3765 2018-08-08 17:27:54 A lot of restaurants use blocks of beef lard for their frying oil 
3766 2018-08-08 17:27:51 Meh.  Wanna really show you’re serious?  Stop buying the KSA’s unethical oil!
3767 2018-08-08 17:27:45 Iranians are the wrong color for tRump to gaf about...it’s all about the oil
3768 2018-08-08 17:27:43 Also, Oil has made an entire 2 videos about Trisha. While Trisha has made COUNTLESS videos about her, or SWolf. You guys are the most narcissistic hypocrites on the Internet. Please, encourage Trisha to keep filing false claims so she will eventually charged with perjury. LOL
3769 2018-08-08 17:27:40 Yeah it's the other way around, city is full of oil
3770 2018-08-08 17:27:37 The 771 km-long oil pipeline may transport up to 22 million tons of oil per year to China's southwest Yunnan Province.  CNPC holds a 50.9% stake in the pipelines project, with the Burmese military regime's Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) holding the remaining 49.1%
3771 2018-08-08 17:27:36 Alot of rich Republicans reside and invest in those beaches and they don't agree with Trumps plans to build oil rigs and ruin  their property value( let alone the fishing and tourism industry). SEE YOU IN NOVEMBER !
3772 2018-08-08 17:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3773 2018-08-08 17:27:33 simple pnye cleansing oil best gila ! Whitehead pn senang nak keluar, muka jadi lembut especially on the nose part 
3774 2018-08-08 17:27:32 You do. Use castor oil instead. You'll get thick long lashes
3775 2018-08-08 17:27:19 tRump Snake Oil contains Russian asbestos. 
3776 2018-08-08 17:27:19 “If your plan is for a year, sell oil. If it’s for ten years, build a refinery. If it’s for a hundred years, educate the children.” #Ghana #Education #TrackSystem
3777 2018-08-08 17:27:07 The short one would also like to know if you have any old oil cans or signs...
3778 2018-08-08 17:27:06 Use castor oil!! It will grow back really fast and thick
3779 2018-08-08 17:27:03 Yup... Can diversify
We are rich in many resources
Unlike SA who only has oil to count on.... which will run out and then they’re stuck with a giant sandbox....
Maybe they can market in kitty litter?
3780 2018-08-08 17:26:53 Check the oil and water in your cars .... it’s a long drive from Devon 
3781 2018-08-08 17:26:47 lol....i called him "snake oil saleman" from day one.
3782 2018-08-08 17:26:45 Luckily he's fine. He's up and about, back to his usual self for the most part. We've re-scheduled the trip, but it didn't stop me from dropping $50 online. Running out of shower scrub and bath oil is serious business for me. I wait for no appendix. lmao
3783 2018-08-08 17:26:43 Clary Sage + Peppermint oil diffusing in the atmosphere, combined with Flute or Classical music get me in a place of focus and creativity.

Shame on Eastern Canada being whipped by Saudi’s like their Women & Prisoners & still buying 11’/, of your oil from them
Ont & Que also buy oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator & Trump’s USA. 
You are embarrassing us
3786 2018-08-08 17:26:30 I need a full body massage with nothing but baby oil 
3787 2018-08-08 17:26:28 When Thatcher privatised British Gas in 1986 most shares were bought up by Kuwait, Quatar, Saudi Arabia & similar! They wanted to diversify!  Guess who owns the gas main system in UK? Quatar! The #Tories sold it all off so that rich foreign oil states could make a profit from US!
3788 2018-08-08 17:26:18 How many oppressive governments has the US backed to save its monied interests? For oil? To secure trade routes? To preserve imperial dominance? Maintain a monopoly?
3789 2018-08-08 17:26:06 Efficascent Oil ang sagot!
3790 2018-08-08 17:26:02 Lavender Essential Oil is one of my #favourite
3791 2018-08-08 17:25:58 Humanity originally selected its leaders from spiritual philosophers, aristocrats, legal philosophers, warriors, and businessmen. Modern leaders are chosen from political snake oil salesmen and greedy grifters.
3792 2018-08-08 17:25:55 He can't say that as they are literally the Biggest Oil Ever seen on planet earth
3793 2018-08-08 17:25:49 I sometimes add extra palmoil to my beans when I’m eating because the initial oil isn’t enough for me 
3794 2018-08-08 17:25:42 You know, I’ve only ever eaten kohlrabi raw (peeled & sliced)! I think it can be roasted with a bit of olive oil, salt, maybe garlic? Probably could be boiled or steamed, etc.
3795 2018-08-08 17:25:34 If I can smell your patchouli oil throughout the entire store, you should MAYBE look into a fucking shower.
3796 2018-08-08 17:25:33 Stepped into the Essential Oil Dimension @TW_Morrison
3797 2018-08-08 17:25:32 I think Pakistan has known about this oil deposits for decades but it did not tap it bcz the oilfield is shared between Iran and Pakistan ..and also Pakistan has been a battlefield for US WoT since 2001.. hopefully Pakistan can take advantage of its resources now.
3798 2018-08-08 17:25:28 In #Quebec we're assured Trans Can expansion doesn't mean more oil production - it means less dependence on Saudi? ... nope ... on the USA! 
We have our own ethical oil ... Time to get behind it and #EnergyEast
3799 2018-08-08 17:25:27 I have a little crush on this worker who helps me with my oil changes when I’m come to the dealer and I canceled twice before coming today and he noticed :’)
3800 2018-08-08 17:25:23 Saudi Arabia is advancing quickly to sustainable energy. This is bigger than oil....it's about a new economy in a crisis loaded future
3801 2018-08-08 17:25:12 Snake Oil Salesman is right.
3802 2018-08-08 17:25:06 Accidentally fried beef in washing-up-liquid instead of oil...
3803 2018-08-08 17:24:57 Africa has been exploited for control over its resources: slave labor oil rare minerals diamonds  for centuries by malignant whites! indigenous Africans have fought for centuries for autonomy but powerful gov'ts have billions$ & greedy leaders  stop progress w/ death & disease

3807 2018-08-08 17:24:28 I’d say we ship the Maritimes their oil from Churchill.  Quebec can buy it from wherever the f•ck they like.  Or they give up all the equalization payments.
3808 2018-08-08 17:24:27 And he's having trouble proving it's actually snake oil he is selling.
3809 2018-08-08 17:24:20 Been awake for 2 hours, hit 2 banks, payed bills, hit Walmart, cleaned my car out, did laundry and now I’m getting my oil changed.... ALL WITHOUT A BLUNT smh

3814 2018-08-08 17:24:00 lu bersihin pake oil aja masih ada
3815 2018-08-08 17:23:59 My point, which flew right over your head, it that this is market capitalism. Oil moves and gets traded by private enterprise. The market does what ever brings them the most profit

If people don't like that the alternative is a command economy or nationalization,...socialism.
3816 2018-08-08 17:23:57 Prescient. Book I’m reading mentions early prospecting for oil on the west side of Cook Inlet in the 1920s, but they didn’t have any luck. Weren’t far off, though. Imagine if the Inlet oil boom had started then instead of decades later.
3817 2018-08-08 17:23:50 yes no more oil make them ride pedal bikes let's just make it commies
3818 2018-08-08 17:23:44 That’s not oil

3820 2018-08-08 17:23:44 The analogy is quite immature. The two nations have taken separate course and have drifted far far away from each other. Talk about uniting them of you can unite oil and water.
3821 2018-08-08 17:23:32 Corrie Yelland will be joining us to speak about how she used cannabis oil extract to cure herself of rare forms of cancer. She was diagnosed in July 2011 and was given 2-4 months to live if she did not do radiation.
So she started taking Cannabis Oil and waited a year to go back

3830 2018-08-08 17:22:59 Early in my career, I drove a Bradley 80 hours without break, until I blew the oil regulator. And I said, "whew..."

And you know assholes might call me a conspiracy theorist, but teh sp? Aruara exists, like the F117 existed back then, we saw it.

So, 10 years later, civilians...

3833 2018-08-08 17:22:23 @SpencerFernando IF you don't like Canada leave it. You are an idiot betraying Canadians, it makes no difference where eastern Canada gets its oil... Deport Spencer Fernando. Treasonous for attacking Canadian Government.

3836 2018-08-08 17:22:05 Again, what oil?  The government doesn't get all the money, just the tax revenue, and for the last two years that was zero.  In fact, the UK government is paying for the remaining oil to be extracted. God, it's like bashing your head off a brick wall.
3837 2018-08-08 17:22:01 響いてもいいような綺麗な夜……
3838 2018-08-08 17:21:55 So now people will short oil pushing it even lower.
A 25-percent tariff on U.S. imports impacts prices further.
Oil will spike if shorts get squeezed.
Meanwhile refineris will score huge % gains next quarter from lower feedstock prices. Differentials widening
3839 2018-08-08 17:21:50 Me and Beans took the most scenic drive to the Ithaca VW dealership only to find out I only need an oil change every 10,000 miles #litty
3840 2018-08-08 17:21:43 Right great pound sand it is. How do you suggest we use our own oil with current govt hand in glove with US oil and against oil independence for Canada while hiding behind environmental policies? No we would have to import from US at higher prices!
3841 2018-08-08 17:21:36 Oil infrastructure stocks continue to reach 52 week highs on Permain buildout and balance sheet restructuring.  These stocks remind me of the banks in the early 2010s after financial crisis restructuring.  Yields range between 5%-7%. $PAA $MMP $MPLX $WPZ $KMI

3846 2018-08-08 17:20:55 I have a friend in Aruba and I’m stranded for two hours while my car gets an oil change. damn
3847 2018-08-08 17:20:52 If you want to call someone else dumb perhaps spellcheck and fact check your statements first? 

There is a net EXPORT of oil from Canada. By a 400% margin. 

"We" don't import oil. Private companies import that oil because it is more profitable, Are you a communist now?
3848 2018-08-08 17:20:51 They are trying to save the Great Barrier Reef, which is habitat for the dugongs. They are also opposing shark culling in QLD and oil drilling in the GAB, plus cleaning beaches across the country. They joined the coalition to stop Dugong hunting and can’t do everything.
3849 2018-08-08 17:20:35 Surely this is fraud? Why aren't the snake oil salesmen being charged?
3850 2018-08-08 17:20:32 True that but mind you he was blackmailed by EFCC with data profiles of all his looting, Rackects and self given oil block. So therefore he was given the option of joining APC or face EFCC palava.

3858 2018-08-08 17:19:21 I don't understand this CBD oil... So u pay just as much as weed for it and it doesn't get you high...

3860 2018-08-08 17:19:16 Pretty much the 3rd Robocop movie. The oil refineries have such a grip on the town and it's not like the city wants to do anything.

3867 2018-08-08 17:18:52 Japan was a defeated country. They didn't have enough oil to move their battleships, or ammunition for their guns. They had tried to ram the battleship Yamato-the pride of the fleet-at the Allied forces because it had no ammunition. They were starving and finished.

3871 2018-08-08 17:18:39 Everyone kept financing homes built with 2x4s that guzzled oil heat. By 2008-2009 oil hit $4/gallon. People were paying more for heat than for their mortgage. 3/

3874 2018-08-08 17:18:11 Planning to revive my #mtb after taking a first glance at it, some oil for the chain and perhaps new wheels should do the trick. And a cleaning of course..
3875 2018-08-08 17:18:08 To be fair almost every gas station weather branded BP or not uses BP oil. I’m chalking it up to their excellent customer service
3876 2018-08-08 17:17:59 Same, girl. I was using First Aid toner pads (which I liked) But my face has been less oily since I stopped. I will also say the vitamin c product you use and the hair oil you use can also make your skin more oily/shiny.

Accept arbitrarily applied censorship or you don't really understand 1984.

Should people advocating for the continued slaughter of brown people half a world away for oil profits also be banned? Why haven't they?
3887 2018-08-08 17:17:06 @Lucas_Oil I used your tire shine, it doesn't stay on more than 2 days in dry weather. I used 3M tire shine on my car, it's stayed on 3days now, even thru rain.
3888 2018-08-08 17:17:02 Those people are unable to extract oil from their own soil without foreigners but they can do 9-11 ? Is it a joke ?
3889 2018-08-08 17:16:59 Is this a new sanction? Why can't we get our oil from Western Canada?

3892 2018-08-08 17:16:47 After multiple swings from loss to profit and back again my forecast for lower oil prices was proven correct as triangle support finally crumbled.  Took large profits on big position but keeping some on as 64/65 is target for this drop.  #WTI #Oil
3893 2018-08-08 17:16:33 I've had pizza in NY, Chicago and Italy. There is nothing like a hot, NY cheese slice, old school from a brick oven. Fold it and see the oil drip onto the paper plate. Bite in and see the cheese stretch a mile... that's pizza.

3897 2018-08-08 17:16:24 I have SUCH a procedure! Glove both hands, open packages and put all meat in one pile. Remove gloves, wash hands. Then glove only on left hand, only left hand touches meat; right hand uses fork to turn meat, add oil, wiggle pan, etc.

3900 2018-08-08 17:16:13 Because their countries have been jacked up for oil?? hello?
3901 2018-08-08 17:16:12 oil barons too?
3902 2018-08-08 17:16:10 These are valid concerns, expressed by decent, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3903 2018-08-08 17:16:04 This is so sad in Australia. It bothers me that people like trump does not think there is an environmental problem.  These people need to get their heads out of the sand and help do something. But if there were problems with oil manufacturing they would do something.
3904 2018-08-08 17:16:01 Fucked around and opened an auto biz hmu for yo oil changes and car work 
3905 2018-08-08 17:16:00 Come on now Michael, don’t insult the snake oil salesman!!!!  #DaddyDon is far worse than even that. Thanks for all that you are doing; your efforts are really making a difference.
3906 2018-08-08 17:15:55 @JustinTrudeau now is the time to promote our environmentally conscious Alberta oil. We don’t need to import oil from Saudi Arabia who limit human rights and fund terrorism #figureitout #PromoteCanada
3907 2018-08-08 17:15:50 I'm not saying that we should eliminate oil entirely. But to eliminate hemp to pave the way for oil was clearly not the best path for humanity. We could have used the best source material for energy and consumer products. Most educated on the subject would prefer nontoxic.

3911 2018-08-08 17:15:32 That was also the first year that oil exploration was documented in the territorial governor’s annual letter. He theorized that Alaska could have a great future in natural gas and oil. There was a refinery near Haines. It was the only known prospect.
3912 2018-08-08 17:15:31 I worked in Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda for an Oil Company and had the honour of a lioness walking across the road in front of my Landcruiser. The size and muscle definition was incredible, you don't realise how powerful they are until up close
3913 2018-08-08 17:15:30 Algae can make oil. It still creates global warming.

3916 2018-08-08 17:15:16 Low oil prices meant solar and energy efficiency 'didn't pay back.' Banks didn't care when doing mortgages. They saw it all as extra costs. Needless add-ons. 2/
3917 2018-08-08 17:15:12 Yes they should and always should have. Let’s not forget we have had so called conservatives in power and there still isn’t a pipeline there. This whole debacle with the Saudis is about Iran. Has fuckall to do with western oil. This govt is speeding up their contingency plan.

3922 2018-08-08 17:14:50 I have excessively painful cramps regularly and I do that but I use the Panaway essential oil blend from Young Living and it works really well for me (my mom’s a seller if you want some!)
3923 2018-08-08 17:14:46 End the arms deal and stop buying their cheap oil.  Canada stand your ground!!
3924 2018-08-08 17:14:44 China is aiming for 30% renewable generation  by 2030 and India is aiming for 55%. Canada currently sits at 60% due to significant hydro power. And Oil is not being replaced by renewable electricity generation, they largely target different uses.

3926 2018-08-08 17:14:40 For them to buy @Tesla is more about strategic. They’re trying to hedge their risk to electric cars. If they can control  productions of electric cars and make only expensive cars, that could buy them time, probably another 20-50 years of selling crude oil.
3927 2018-08-08 17:14:40 You dont replace 15 percent of your oil imports over night
3928 2018-08-08 17:14:38 What is it about overcast days that makes me feel so lethargic? Drinking an iced coffee and put some grapefruit essential oil drops in my air diffuser to see if that helps perk me up. Bleh. Does anyone else get this way?

3935 2018-08-08 17:14:08 HPCL result is better than estimates. Most imp is debt reduction.

On top of good results Crude oil prices have seen sharp fall today.
3936 2018-08-08 17:14:06 It heavily hurts the oil industry recovery in the US, though it alleviates the pressure on oil prices but gas prices are nowhere in danger to drop big time anytime soon
3937 2018-08-08 17:14:03 Happy that the bloodthirsty illey is detained! I was pointing that addis must arrest oromos mobs who were slaughtering innoncent Somalis too as fairness! Oil is again messing with peace! History is repeating itself!

3942 2018-08-08 17:13:39 Canada buys only 9% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, Algeria or Norway can fill that gap easily. Good riddance to
the kingdom in the dessert.

3944 2018-08-08 17:13:17 This is a service loaner, they picked up the MKX to change the oil and left this behind.  :)
3945 2018-08-08 17:13:15 Sometimes you just want breadsticks coated thick with oil and mass produced garlic powder, ya know?
3946 2018-08-08 17:13:11 in as much as we would want to purchase local products can the people pushing for buy local explain, why cement eg 42% PPC costs north of $14 average price, why 2L edible oil >$3 yet regionally the prices are much lower?? Get the prices right to curb abitrage & promote local buy
3947 2018-08-08 17:13:10 You could spray it with vinegar & tea tree oil since it's still damp. That'll help retard mold & bacteria growth. I'd still use baking soda & tea tree oil after it's dry, though.
3948 2018-08-08 17:13:01 Heating pad or hot damp towel, peppermint essential oil diffused w a carrier oil (like coconut) massaged onto lower ab, ginger tea.
3949 2018-08-08 17:12:47 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
3950 2018-08-08 17:12:41 Let’s stop and give our heads a shake. The liberals aren’t going to kickstart fuckall they already did in Canadian oil. This whole charade is in response to Canada (liberals) support of Iran.
3951 2018-08-08 17:12:30 I really have to sit and wait an hour for this damn oil change
3952 2018-08-08 17:12:26 What about palm oil#do you know that the rainforest in Indonesia is destroying because of palm tree #producing palm oil#and causing the extinction of our red cousins#the orangutans ?#
3953 2018-08-08 17:12:25 I remember the 1980s. We were trying to build energy efficient housing in Alaska. Then price of heating oil dropped to $1./gallon. All of a sudden no one cared. 1/

3959 2018-08-08 17:12:07 @liberal_party @NBLA_ALNB @irvingoil Why do you purchase oil from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, knowing their policies on human rights?
3960 2018-08-08 17:12:06 You should use apple cider vinegar rinse method. And following with a good conditioner .. And a leave-in conditioner with some argan oil .. recommend OGX brands for shampoo and conditioner 
3961 2018-08-08 17:11:55 "The statement reported by Saudi media did not mention any intention by Saudi Arabia to raise production by 2 million barrels per day. Saudi oil officials did not immediately comment."

not to be dramatic or anything but it’s life changing 
3965 2018-08-08 17:11:08 Hemp is non-toxic and biodegradable. You and your oil buddies prefer to give us a toxic world. You should get a refund on your renewable resource degree. If left out some important topics.
3966 2018-08-08 17:11:06 Is that why you are working hard at stifling oil companies?They are leaving in droves to do biz Texas?  No carbon tax in Texas either. Works for them not so much for Ab & Canada.
3967 2018-08-08 17:11:03 And we don't even get the snake oil, which is at least 80 proof (I've been told).
3968 2018-08-08 17:11:01 Tragedy is that most of us did NOT realise, but were so pissed off with the #statusQuo that we swallowed the lies of the snake oil salesmen

Not a questionable weekly inventory number or an OPEC sound bite, or a tweet. But a long term focus owning the option that never expires (equities). @Go_Rozen

3996 2018-08-08 17:08:51 I need baby oil 
3997 2018-08-08 17:08:43 I have used it with castor oil.
3998 2018-08-08 17:08:42 I wish there was a way to put the snake oil guy in jail!
3999 2018-08-08 17:08:40 Gotta find somethjn productive to do. Too much rain so I pulled all our equipment in and changed oil. Clocked out n there is too much day left to not get somethin done

4001 2018-08-08 17:08:35 i’m currently lying in the bath, surrounded by candles, in a coconut and lime bubble bath, with a freesia and baobab bath oil, whilst wearing a rose water and aloe vera face mask, drinking caramel coffee and and listening to camila cabello. i really am living my best life.
4002 2018-08-08 17:08:35 No oil on the track? @ruthlesslambert
4003 2018-08-08 17:08:35 11:07am Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil from Diesel and Dust
4004 2018-08-08 17:08:33 On the face of it pipelines seem to be the culprit, but the US produces enough domestically that it can be a net exporter.  The discount gives better profit margin and would stay in place even if pipelines existed to take every drop of oil to the US market.
4005 2018-08-08 17:08:22 Modest is NOT 20 billion. 

Harper would not have let it come to this point. Reason we are in the mess with oil is Feds stop supporting Oil industry day one.
4006 2018-08-08 17:08:05 Turdeau doesn't want Alberta oil. He killed Energy East and continues to import 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia. Middle Eastern dictatorships fuel cars in Ontario and Quebec, while oil from western Canada is exported to the US
4007 2018-08-08 17:08:04 Anyone know a good place I can get my oil changed?
4008 2018-08-08 17:08:01 Not roll back EPA Fuel standards? Not sue states that work to fight climate change? Not sue states to ALLOW offshore oil drilling? Things like that.
4009 2018-08-08 17:07:53 Tea tree oil from Walgreens works amazing! Just put it on a q tip and apply it to the area around the ring twice a day
4010 2018-08-08 17:07:48 Not only a snake  oil salesman ! A TRAITOR ! Russian asset!! #WhereAreTheChildren #Wherearethejobs

4012 2018-08-08 17:07:38 SHAME on YOU for NOT standing up to TRUMP's Trade war which is hurting farmers and businesses.  Not only that, it is coating Americans more at the gas pump as the price of oil goes up and the cost of goods increases because of TRUMP and the GOP.  VOTE OUT GOP!!
4013 2018-08-08 17:07:37 I have to get an oil change but my bed is just too damn comfortable!
4014 2018-08-08 17:07:31 Loc stands for leave in, oil, cream
4015 2018-08-08 17:07:30 I think that the Saudi Kingdom has proven it is anti-democratic and does not react well to being "exposed". What's happening in Yemen is a human rights disaster. Other G7 need their oil. We don't. That's the big difference between Canada and it's allies.
4016 2018-08-08 17:07:29 @PremierScottMoe CHURCHILL MANITOBA come on really AB SK MB WOULD NEED NO ONE , its so sad our economy would explode all three build a HUGE REFINERY  sell many PRODUCTS  not just one OIL . Get that PORT running .
4017 2018-08-08 17:07:29 i valorize the working class by having crushes on some mechanics, short order cooks (especially at Waffle House or Denny's), landscapers, construction workers, and the guys that change my oil
4018 2018-08-08 17:07:28 Aw thank you sis!  I cleanse my face with dr. Bronners castile soap daily, after I put natural Witch Hazel and Aloe Vera gel. For moisture I have a oil mix I made with grape seed, jojoba, avacado, and almond oil. And lastly I do my clay mask w/ ACV 2 or 3 times week!! 
4019 2018-08-08 17:07:26 Keep your dirty oil and your money; you know you can’t eat that right? All the best, you will not be missed.
4020 2018-08-08 17:07:16 I would caution that Parsley is still at risk of the steep Midland-WTI differential on the oil side and the Waha-HH differential on the dry gas side, some of that is hedged but only some. Pros include LT growth story solid, B/S strong, positive NI that grew q-o-q
4021 2018-08-08 17:07:09 personally I considered that b-4 I grabbed more just below .29 a week or there about ago, debt free going into TRUMPS oil stand off lol, was another consideration
4022 2018-08-08 17:07:05 Private businesses have second thoughts due to America's unilateral extraterritorial sanctions.

The EU has enacted a blocking statute to shield the businesses and can impose fines for complying with the US sanctions, but cannot force them to keep up their business with Iran.
4023 2018-08-08 17:06:52 Canada has more oil in the ground than Saudis. We have the leverage.
4024 2018-08-08 17:06:48 Idk what that is lol but I heard eucalyptus oil is good for dry hair
4025 2018-08-08 17:06:32 Why banned because they kill lifeforms without messing with infrastructure. As Dubya warned “do not destroy your oil wells”
4026 2018-08-08 17:06:29 I agree with your points though I don't think they actually run counter to what I said. One way we can change is by dispelling the narrative that there is too much money to be made in oil and meat, there's far and away more money to be made with green friendly options...
4027 2018-08-08 17:06:28 Baba say na completion
4028 2018-08-08 17:06:20 Literally can’t ever go in and get my oil change or anything done for my car without getting hit on 
4029 2018-08-08 17:06:17 Apple turnover.

That will either be scalding hot or hard enough to use as a ramp when it's time to change your oil.
4030 2018-08-08 17:06:17 The rickshaw stand at Indian oil metro stop take in 4 to start no cops are seen on their route 3 on 2 wheelers is common site many places no particular spot is known cops would be so they ask 1to get off, where there is metro barrier 2 wheelers go  wrong way to avoid long route
4031 2018-08-08 17:06:14 My hairs sooo soft after doing my coconut oil treatment last night
4032 2018-08-08 17:06:05 Oil is just fuckin crazy...
4033 2018-08-08 17:05:57 해킹?
4034 2018-08-08 17:05:49 i have severe pms so i feel this so hard - evening primrose oil, magnesium, vitamins in general, wash your hands & face in cold water to balance out ur body temp, take breaks whenever you need them, stock up on snacks so u stay fed if you're too tired to cook
4035 2018-08-08 17:05:37 Oh Yeah! Is like we found for the first time Crude Oil and Jack pot Black Gold that is in the past is over need think 4 new era
4036 2018-08-08 17:05:30 One of the great ways we can keep our $ here is to have renewable energy combined with electric cars. No foreign oil purchased, and we can make the power with sun and wind that we have in abundance in the USA.
4037 2018-08-08 17:05:23 The neo liberal order which is the world bank and IMF want to start privatising water resources since water would be the fuel of the future that aquifer is already sold just like the oil block which wetangula sold to tullow
4038 2018-08-08 17:05:16 making beard products is my favorite - i end up using the beard oil i make as hair oil myself, i was able to stop using conditioner all together! if i had a beard i would have a fuckin cabinet of dope beard products. look at that comb! im jealous
4039 2018-08-08 17:05:14 So when you tell your former host 'mom' who you're on your way to meet about you effexor situation and she's like "good thing I have that Canabis oil"  at the cabin  #onlyinBC #anxietybuddies #mycanadianfamily
4040 2018-08-08 17:05:14 Ughhh I know.  I checked they actually changed the oil  I’d found a place where they didn’t hassle me AND had an office dog but they were booked like a week out and I just wanted to get it done with. DUMB
4041 2018-08-08 17:05:10 Your degree didn't cover the history of hemp, and how it was eliminated as major industrial crop to pave the way for oil to dominate. As a result we have a toxic world. Pacific and Indian Ocean garbage patches that the fish mistake for food as plastic disintegrates.
4042 2018-08-08 17:05:05 Quit buying Saudi oil dummy.
4043 2018-08-08 17:05:05 #NoteToSelf don't bite fingers after painting. Oil paint tastes disgusting.
4044 2018-08-08 17:04:44 Have y’all checked the latest data past few years on comet ingredients?

I was blown away when reading NASAs reports how oil shale can be found in comets! 

I guess @michaelbay & @jjabrams were right?
4045 2018-08-08 17:04:41 Definitely the Avon spray, I use it all of the time and as it’s a dry oil spray you can lather it all over
4046 2018-08-08 17:04:34 How about oil production?  The United States is on pace to be the largest producer of oil in the world by the end of 2018.  You know what that means?  No more Saudi.  No more Syria.  No more Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, or whoever.  No more depending on the Middle East and it’s oil.
4047 2018-08-08 17:04:32 Me on an oil rig: You want me to do what? Outside? Are you crazy?
Me in a daycare: Go away children, Miss Suzanne needs to be on Facebook for a moment
4048 2018-08-08 17:04:25 If you want to try CBD oil, you can use code Tweet15 to get 15% off our products  Hope this helps
4049 2018-08-08 17:04:23 Did Mr. Trump & Mr. Pence once again help out the Russian economy and it's dictator Putin. Looks like it! Imposing sanctions on Iranian oil is increasing the cost Russian can get for oil at a time they desperately need cash. The regime of Putin is in deep financial trouble.
4050 2018-08-08 17:04:21 Because that's where all the oil is and the bankers feel threatened by a religion that nans usury
4051 2018-08-08 17:04:12 I, like many others I'm sure, would rather see canadian refineries producing oil for the Canadian market. 
Refineries in Alberta and northern Ontario make sense to me, but that's not likely going to happen.
4052 2018-08-08 17:04:03 This is your new conspiracy theory? That we're all fat, balding, scared, racist, misogynist, homophobic, angry snake oil salesmen, trying to steal money from the parents of murdered school children?
4053 2018-08-08 17:04:01 So China wants to produce uneconomic oil again? What are they worried about, a US naval embargo? I don't understand the logic. 

Why not buy Trans Mountain off of Ottawa's hands and then they can have as much cheap Canadian crude as they want.
4054 2018-08-08 17:04:01 yes gyul and then lmk ! i does apply it on ‘wet surface’ lmaooo it does feel weird since its water and oil but the ting still gets the job doneee
4055 2018-08-08 17:03:59 JAHIL INSAAN, oil is found in the depth of 8 to 12 thousand feet. How come they concluded it at 5000 feet? Stop spreading your ignorance.
4056 2018-08-08 17:03:56 Little bit obsessed with @Zoella ‘s lip oil. Best. Thing. Ever.  Please forever keep it going. If not I’ll end up buying the shelves so I have it forever @ZoellaBeauty
4057 2018-08-08 17:03:52 Y’all don’t understand how happy I am finally getting an oil change it’s da lil tingz
4058 2018-08-08 17:03:43 Awww, that’s hard. I use a natural product called “Rescue Remedy” the pet version- to help my kitties when they have anxiety when we go away. You can find it at health food stores. I have also used lavender and/or chamomile oil in a diffuser to calm them.
4059 2018-08-08 17:03:31 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
4060 2018-08-08 17:03:16 I got my oil change done at jiffy, even though I think that’s a bit more expensive than average.
I’m just lazy like that.
4061 2018-08-08 17:03:02 She does shes getting a wash, cut, blow out, hot oil treatment, deep conditioning treatment, massage, paw massage, teeth treatment, doggy exfoliation, and hair accessories LMAO
4062 2018-08-08 17:02:54 raw mushrooms, burnt black pudding, beans look cold and the chef thought he was doing fish and chips by adding those potatoes on the side. Egg was cracked into a cold pan of oil and the 2 sausages bully the fat one.
4063 2018-08-08 17:02:41  govt shd consider ban on sale edible product in plastic pouch incl veritable oil,milk, butter milk etc instead promote the use glass bottle or thin metal can.
4064 2018-08-08 17:02:41 How context is everything with #statistics - In 2016 UK offshore #oilandgas industry released 115 tonnes of #oil into the North Sea! Sounds bad? In 2016 UK O&G lost just 0.00014% of produced #oil in leakages. Credit @oilandgasuk
4065 2018-08-08 17:02:26 You don’t realize how long you sweat after a workout until you go for a run during an oil change and have to constantly wipe away copious amounts of sweat while explaining that you don’t need new spark plugs or a cabin filter.
4066 2018-08-08 17:02:15 been replacing micellar water with cleansing oil for bout 2 weeks and im seeing improvement on moi skinn 
4067 2018-08-08 17:02:10 Nut oil and animal allergens I can only imagine as significantly different. Carpet is expensive and then there are always other liabilities that the facilities could potentially absorb. You are paying for risk management and administration.
4068 2018-08-08 17:01:43 Saudis and Qatar are trying to hedge against a future where we don’t have so much need for oil for transportation. Cooking and heating though will still be gas based for a while.
4069 2018-08-08 17:01:42 When your significant other is in the military, oil field etc that causes them to be away from home knowing they are sacrificing the time to be w you to provide and chase there dreams is tough but the bond you build is unexplainable.
4070 2018-08-08 17:01:40 Oil you say!?.....
Large reserves you say!?......
US democracy bombs & regime change coming soon!
4071 2018-08-08 17:01:39 i also tried it on face and it doesn't do harm to it i think it helped with oil on face a little? don't recommend putting in spray bottle tho bc it sprays in eyes and it burns acidic  just pat on face or use a cotton pad
4072 2018-08-08 17:01:38 Wow!  Presume you tried Magnesium supplements (works for me) and  also some magnesium oil rubbed into affected limbs?  Obviously no need if the soap is working.
4073 2018-08-08 17:01:36 Now that the Saudis are poised to cut off the 100K barrels of oil they ship to Eastern Canada each month, it's great to see the talking heads on CBC recognizing the need for the Energy East pipeline project. (said no one)
4074 2018-08-08 17:01:28 Um... the domestic oil resources? Canada is hardly lacking
4075 2018-08-08 17:01:27 I keep hearing bout CBD oil and that it works wonders I gotta do my research
4076 2018-08-08 17:01:18 If you're referring to OHVs crossing streams, they aren't in the water long enough to collect anything to spread as a boat does. Likely on a trail one is crossing the same meandering stream, being the same body of water. People who own OHVs take good care to avoid oil leaks.
4077 2018-08-08 17:01:07 17 Billion Naira for a device to be used in tracking losses of Crude oil. FGN wha device ? This Election Season Is Serious..

4083 2018-08-08 17:00:34 Been in deep depressive funk this past week so made myself leave the bedroom today. Went to a community garden &harvested some fresh lavender. We also took home some that'd been drying (there was a massive heap). Will process into infused oil tonight & put rest a jar for tea.
4084 2018-08-08 17:00:31 Dear Mr. President, first of all thank you and your family for your service and sacrifice. Now, please tell Wall Street to stop trading Crude Oil. This will stabilize gas prices around $2 per gallon. Everyone in the country will thank you

4092 2018-08-08 17:00:11 Went to get an oil change, and pulled in behind not only another Hyundai Elantra, but ALSO another NEW HAMPSHIRE LICENSE PLATE.
4093 2018-08-08 17:00:10 Probably not the best decision to get my oil changed with so many things to do today... car won’t be ready until 5!
4094 2018-08-08 17:00:07 You want a wall on the  Canadian border also? Flights from Mexico to Canada are $300. And no visa.
A 5 K mile wall ?
You want for our children clean air, water, our parks free of mining and oil drilling. 
You must also be a liberal!
Is your purpose in life to make some CEO rich
4095 2018-08-08 16:59:59 itu apa kok busa itu. oil y?
4096 2018-08-08 16:59:57 On my side of the pond it's the opposite problem - not enough oil being used and not enough cooking resulting in tough eggplant. The trick is hitting a spot in the middle.

4099 2018-08-08 16:59:52 If we ask man who work on oil rigs if a woman should work for equal pay on an oil rig, half or more might say yes. I am not a feminist. I consider myself more of a humanist. I want us all to be treated equally and paid equally for the same job and work.

4101 2018-08-08 16:59:24 They only kind of support LGBTQ rights, they’re a party financed by big oil who pushes fracking around the world, they had full control of government and gave us a right wing healthcare plan w/o a public option, they purged voters all across the country & destroyed ballots in FL
4102 2018-08-08 16:59:21 Are you kidding me look what you did, Oil is going through the roof now. Like do you even have a high school diploma ?any moron would not have said what you said. They’ve been treating their people like that for hundreds of years, open your big mouth durin NAFTA.
4103 2018-08-08 16:59:14 Oil was just recently discovered on the Golan Heights. The conflict with Syria over the Golan has been going on for 70 years. Golan Heights is militarily a very strategic area.
4104 2018-08-08 16:59:12 Having a degree in renewable resources and working in the oil industry, I know that petroleum is the reason we lead the world.

I didn't think so Mr. Hinniekamper.

4108 2018-08-08 16:58:55 Falkland Islanders were given British Citizenship in 1983. This was a geopolitical contrivance in order to protect any potential oil/mineral wealth in the area.
4109 2018-08-08 16:58:45 It’s decent. I have to go get some Argan oil and some biosilk because ya kno, blonde hair has to constantly be moisturized 
4110 2018-08-08 16:58:37 Maybe it's time to stop kowtowing to your military industrial, wall street banking, big pharma, oil and gas pushing advertising base and actually broadcast the news.
4111 2018-08-08 16:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
4112 2018-08-08 16:58:19 Yeah sure, “rich businessman” invests billions into oil and gas companies in order to tank the price of oil (and therefore his investment in the same) to help the Obama administration destabilize a socialist country.
4113 2018-08-08 16:57:54 A snake oil salesman who is in charge of a cabal of snake oil salesmen. Every single one of them fall like dominoes, lying and conning on the way down.
4114 2018-08-08 16:57:37 There are a few different ones. Made pizza for 8..favourites were pepperoni, buffalo mozzarella and basil. Chicken, pesto, mozzarella and basil and the third favourite was prosciutto, mushroom mozzarella and basil.  Topped with a little garlic oil. Each one was heaven on a plate!
4115 2018-08-08 16:57:33 Dill, Velvet leaf, Chili peppers, Jalapeno pepper, Green tomatoes, Red Chard, Cilantro, pig leaf, olive oil, turmeric, Himalayan salt. Sauteed. Delicious and hearty! #LeksIIIOrganicFarms

4119 2018-08-08 16:57:10 The Dems have rolled over for Trump on these same anti-environment attacks. Something tells me that even if the democrats were in charge the environment would STILL be screwed over.

Let's not forget that Hillary & Obama both supported fracking & Hillary voted for oil drilling.
4120 2018-08-08 16:56:39 The US government won't condemn SA because of oil and the need for another ally in the Middle East besides Israel. Read comments by US citizens and you'll see that they don't actually agree with SA's human rights record.
4121 2018-08-08 16:56:30 US Intel also implicated Saudis in 9/11 Twin Towers attack. Trump even tweeted about it 2 years ago ..but oil.
4122 2018-08-08 16:56:18 Castor oil :))
4123 2018-08-08 16:56:16 125 for a oil change I need my Camry again 
4124 2018-08-08 16:56:12 Time for Canada to build xtra refineries and let Saudi Arabia go. We have our own crude oil reserve to easily compensate Saudi 10 % oil import.
Without oil,Saudi's Prince is only a Bedouin in a desert
4125 2018-08-08 16:56:06 #historically #oil #energy has traded considerably lower then current levels #oott someone profited. #dont #listen #to #this #nonsense or #listen #we #wont
4126 2018-08-08 16:55:53 Sorry what was that?! Do they have oil and make him rich?! No....then no he doesnt hear them
4127 2018-08-08 16:55:50 If a woman wants to work on an oil rig she can and should earn the same as her male workers. Her life is equally valuable as her male co workers. She also has a family to take care of. If the job couldn’t be filled by a man and a woman wants it then yes.
4128 2018-08-08 16:55:47 canada doesn't need Saudi oil. we do not need a "royal" puppet to dictate to us what we can say or not
4129 2018-08-08 16:55:40 Lmao where’d you get the oil, I shouldn’t have a problem getting the other stuff
4130 2018-08-08 16:55:24 i used monistat 3 day as well as coconut oil for the itch and well as plain greek yogurt.
4131 2018-08-08 16:55:24 waiter: what to drink?
me: a dasani water please
waiter: Is Aquafina good?
me: I’d rather drink motor oil 
4132 2018-08-08 16:55:23 Yeah, I'm sure the battle cries are for the people of Iran. 

Oh yeah, there's a shit ton of oil to be had, also, but y'all weren't thinkin' 'bout that,  huh?
4133 2018-08-08 16:55:21 Used a new heat protector on my hair today and I'm pissed because it's an oil based one and now my hair is oily again after I just washed it last night 
4134 2018-08-08 16:55:16 Yes... It gives the oil companies here to raise the already high gas price in Canada even higher for not clear reason.

Hawaii Pays less gas than anywhere in Canada. 

LoL .... Strange but true!
4135 2018-08-08 16:55:02 According to the UN, 400 billion dollars are needed to reconstruct Syria 
Putin tried all his weapons in Syria as he did in Grozny, and now he asks Westerners to rebuild what he destroyed,while getting his hands on all Syrian riches (natural gas and oil) with his Iranian allies
4136 2018-08-08 16:54:59 Wow nigga ain’t never offered to change my oil 
4137 2018-08-08 16:54:51 *me explaining eagle oil
me: it's dau xanh
him: wow you wrote that so well i would have just wrote YO SUN
4138 2018-08-08 16:54:46 When oil prices fall there is a financial Crisis, with a capital C. Yet, oil has to support the state. Yes, fair is fair. And making oil and gas support the state isn’t fair. Just because there are a few billionaires (that provide thousands of jobs), oil is vilified. Why?

4141 2018-08-08 16:54:25 I had a dream that cooking oil was replaced by Brown Sauce and @MikeHynd was having a big fry-up. I was very distresses by this, he wouldn’t listen to me about it being a waste of brown sause.
4142 2018-08-08 16:54:17 Except that he can't actually sell snake oil.
4143 2018-08-08 16:54:07 This is why pipelines are a much better and safer way to transport fuel and oil
4144 2018-08-08 16:54:04 Love coconut oil!
4145 2018-08-08 16:54:00 I hate when my hair gets dry, I be so quick to grab my oil and a spray bottle.
4146 2018-08-08 16:54:00 Yeah but Americas Snake Oil industry is up 10,000% because of @realDonaldTrump so he can campaign on that
4147 2018-08-08 16:53:48 If we do hit the jack pot and found oil , there nothing Us can do about it because luckily for us china need for oil and our geopolitical location give Pakistan a status of Mecca for chinese and central Asia , India and china can get oil from Pakistan without huge import cost.
4148 2018-08-08 16:53:45 Just finished a late breakfast: chai tea with butter, coconut oil and a scoop of protein powder w/ an omelette and uncured bacon. Who else is doing a version of the high-fat/high-protein diet? Why did you change, how long have you done it and how have you felt? :-) #keto #paleo
4149 2018-08-08 16:53:40 Apparently I didn't know what oil or shine control HAHAHA

4158 2018-08-08 16:53:04 Your money comes from oil... once it’s gone... it’s gone..  Can diversify with all their resources.. so keep spending your money and enjoy living on a house of cards... while you can
4159 2018-08-08 16:53:04 Y’all i made dog treats with cbd oil for my dogs and why the hell did my stepdad and brother eat them.....
4160 2018-08-08 16:53:03 @KSAmofaEN  You are a brutal regime that is one of the WORST human rights violators, and Canada will not be cowed by some idiots in the desert.  Go pull all of your SA morons out of Canada.  Nothing of value will be lost.  You can't even exploit your own oil without Western help.
4161 2018-08-08 16:52:53 Realpolitik - we need Saudi oil and for them to recycle their petrodollars. An ethical foreign policy is for the birds such as Robins.

#bbcpm
4162 2018-08-08 16:52:52 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub----_-
4163 2018-08-08 16:52:49 alguien aquí en mi TL consume #CBD Oil...
4164 2018-08-08 16:52:43 แซวน้องสาวเหรอ
4165 2018-08-08 16:52:40 Yay! I carry a bottle of peppermint oil 
4166 2018-08-08 16:52:23 oil rich countries are already investing in solar and nuclear energy, we need to worrie about india. do behave as if we have it all worked out.
4167 2018-08-08 16:52:22 Stop crying child  no one threatening anyone , as soon as we cut the oil from CA ur economy will suffer  no need to destroy any building
4168 2018-08-08 16:52:19 You mean pipelines and dams, neither of which are "critical", especially in an age where alternatives would already be in place if it weren't for the derailment by the oil industry. If you want to lay blame, lay it there.

As for the rest of it, there are our lands.
4169 2018-08-08 16:52:18 Sir! You have a front so big, it would be impossible to transport it to la la land even with the 20 oil tankers delivering your orange body liquid. Given your troubles, I would just keep quiet for a bit and while away the time, either golfing, or learning how to read. Difficult!
4170 2018-08-08 16:52:15 現地文化に土足で踏み込むな
4171 2018-08-08 16:52:08 I’ve never had to get out of my car to get an oil change before... Until today. 
4172 2018-08-08 16:52:07 Are you an oil
4173 2018-08-08 16:52:06 Thank you jamie! ive got all the acrylic done. Today im going to do some oil over to intensify it a bit.
4174 2018-08-08 16:51:55 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
4175 2018-08-08 16:51:53 I added a little olive oil, salt pepper and crushed red pepper. I don't like tomatoes lmao
4176 2018-08-08 16:51:43 How does one not come to the conclusion on oil state wants to bury an electric car company?
4177 2018-08-08 16:51:42 Well I’m sure you’re not putting sunblock on and just tanning oil 
4178 2018-08-08 16:51:37 When such a tread war is going on how your team mates promoting oil at 100  usd पर बैरल     
4179 2018-08-08 16:51:37 If only Canada was smart and build a pipeline to refine its own oil instead of importing it from such countries
4180 2018-08-08 16:51:36 RT @ "BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Rememeber this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault."
4181 2018-08-08 16:51:32 Well,fossil fuels are gonna be depleted at one point,which is a fact.And we've survived without them for most of human history.Most new transportation here is electric(including public transport), so yea for me using as less as possible oil products is the way to go
4182 2018-08-08 16:51:28 PAM uses Palm Oil. Palm oil grows in tropical rainforests, and the uncontrolled clearing of  these forests for conventional palm oil plantations has led to  widespread loss of these irreplaceable and biodiverse rich forests.
4183 2018-08-08 16:51:17 I expect they only pay 'appearance fee/expenses' when demanded by IEA or TaxPayersAlliance etc - lobby/PR outfits secretly funded by industry groups to lobby for tobacco, house building, alcohol, oil/climate. 
BBC feels obliged to pay, as under Tory pressure re balance in QT etc.
4184 2018-08-08 16:51:05 What is wrong with the Saudi 's can't take criticism they are not perfect only know how to sponsor terror and LETS STOP BUYING OIL From them
4185 2018-08-08 16:51:03 Never try this with usa or the uk with many significant foreign investments. In the hotel industry or prem league, bank etc for example and ofcourse “oil”. Rather canada could potentialy lose much more from discouraging FDI, foreign student on government scholarships, etc. But...
4186 2018-08-08 16:51:02 Is there even any oil in Syria?
4187 2018-08-08 16:50:51 Girl I feel you idk what products to use at all ever.... I been putting a little coconut oil and calling it a day but I need to figure something out lmao
4188 2018-08-08 16:50:45 When such a tread war is going on how your team mates promoting oil at 100  usd 
4189 2018-08-08 16:50:43 Ankara seller, I might slide into your DMs one day
4190 2018-08-08 16:50:33 So basically we stop providing them with arms and stop purchasing  cheap oil from them.  Sounds like a win win!
4191 2018-08-08 16:50:28 Right in your face Trudeau, How about you and your cronies concentrate on paying our national debt, attracting foreign investment, helping the oil and gas sector, and stay out of other countries business. right at you Trudeau, Saudis  pulling out of Canada?
4192 2018-08-08 16:50:22 I never put oil in mine.
4193 2018-08-08 16:50:19 Some people will apply oil on there face and go to where the lighting is good and say “clear skin”
4194 2018-08-08 16:50:18 Yeah the CIA have sent in the exploding drones in to the oil rich nation
4195 2018-08-08 16:50:12 No. In fact we had to buy olive oil in tiny bottles from the chemist so it was pretty pants really. Plonker.
4196 2018-08-08 16:50:10 Turkey is starting to really piss me off. They still hold the Pastor and they vow they will continue to purchase Iran's oil. This is unacceptable and NATO should sanction Turkey along with the US. If that doesn't work, kick them out of NATO. Let them defend themselves.
4197 2018-08-08 16:50:03 That Zurich warranty free synthetic oil changes and tire rotations for as long as u own a @subaru_usa I'm with it #SUBARU
4198 2018-08-08 16:50:02 Saudi youth is the biggest YouTube user per capita in the world, which would explain their ads. Notice Western media never utters a word about Saudi, but they’ll slam China and Russia with every breath. Saudi provides our oil, so they can do no wrong.
4199 2018-08-08 16:50:02 Your right, however, Snake oil salesmen have long sat in most political offices.
4200 2018-08-08 16:49:58 Keep an eye on oil as Crude (WTI) is down over 2%..
4201 2018-08-08 16:49:57 tea tree oil babe!!! put it back in and put tea free oil. Walgreens/ cvs/ walmart/ stop n shop/ duane reade has it (idk if you’re back in New York lol)
4202 2018-08-08 16:49:55 55555555 ตัดปัญหา ไม่มีใครเห็น อิอิ
4203 2018-08-08 16:49:54 Keep an eye on oil as Crude (WTI) is down over 2%..
4204 2018-08-08 16:49:49 China can keep buying oil from Iran, but it has to keep production at projects up, which is a slightly different issue given how much investment the Iranian oil and gas sector needs.
4205 2018-08-08 16:49:38 One at Bottom looks like an oil spill 
4206 2018-08-08 16:49:33 Always knew it was snake oil...
4207 2018-08-08 16:49:27 If my oil don’t get changed tomorrow by 12 I’m just leaving.
4208 2018-08-08 16:49:23 Only a snake oil salesman woul make a statement in that way. Muddying it up just enough so your brain dead, phoney conservative, phoney Christian, racist hateful base, thinks she said it’s the fake news. Hey 30% ers SHE DIDNT SAY THE FAKE NEWS PART.  but whatever.
4209 2018-08-08 16:49:22 Their disastrous tale tell us that if you have oil and want to survive go Nuclear otherwise prepare to be a vassal state or be invaded
4210 2018-08-08 16:49:22 Well, we won't be travelling very far, as your industry will have drained the planet dry of oil while making it hard for alternative fuels to succeed, thanks to your lobby groups in the US!
4211 2018-08-08 16:49:18 More like speculation on the demand side. Same story I've been hearing since $35 with no basis. The US is in a bad spot. On one hand shale can't make a profit under $70 and on the other they can't have oil rising otherwise the economy suffers. it's a complete joke.
4212 2018-08-08 16:49:15 So the oil companies and others that sponsor you and pay your wages.. plus your private jet and personal supercars don’t...
4213 2018-08-08 16:49:14 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
4214 2018-08-08 16:49:13 They were first generation green energy, and have proved not to be popular, but until the government invest properly in other forms of environmental energy they’re all we’ve got to combat climate change. I think they’d be better out to sea like the oil fields are.
4215 2018-08-08 16:49:10 そんなんでテンション上がるの狐だけだわわろた反抗期じゃアリマセン
4216 2018-08-08 16:49:07 This is why being independent from oil is important. Saudi’s can manipulate the price of oil at any time. They are not inline with human rights.
4217 2018-08-08 16:48:55 When such a tread war is going on how your team mates promoting oil 100  usd पर बैरल 
4218 2018-08-08 16:48:54 when you're cooking topless because you dont want your clothes smelling like food, then the oil in the pot decides to hit second base with you 
4219 2018-08-08 16:48:52 Yeah losing $millions per day from owning a pipeline that will never hold oil. $ is more important than whales and salmon and clean water.But you don't care you'll be dead before it makes a real difference.huh? Screw the generations of the future! Pfff
4220 2018-08-08 16:48:49 Canada is not a major trade partner with saudi. In reality saudi doesng need canada to buy any of its oil at all. It can do just fine selling to the U.s and asian giants- india/china/singapore etc. This is why they halt future business, because it’s just a small %. They could....

4224 2018-08-08 16:48:27 In the old days we were limited by O2 for pilots then engine oil so O2 is no longer an issue
4225 2018-08-08 16:48:26 Because your entire business model is oil and gas you can only bring more predatory delay. It's right there in your publication. You won't discuss clean energy.
4226 2018-08-08 16:48:23 There isn't enough money in the world to pay me to work on an oil rig or in a daycare, so I guess they are similar. :)
4227 2018-08-08 16:48:21 Peppermint Oil is really the truth. Y'all that have constant headaches and migraines should give it a try if you want to stay off medication/NSAIDs.
4228 2018-08-08 16:48:16 @dale_hoogs @BNNBloomberg build  refineries and go green tech ensure Canada never relies on Arab oil ever again .

4232 2018-08-08 16:47:55 The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announces a 25 percent charge on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, including auto and crude oil.
4233 2018-08-08 16:47:53 Oil, treas, gold, USD are all connected/correl to some degree so tough for one to have a major move that doesn't impact the others. can be noisy day-to-day though.
4234 2018-08-08 16:47:43 The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announces a 25 percent charge on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods, including auto and crude oil.
4235 2018-08-08 16:47:38 Another brilliant financial move.  Almost as stupid as flooding the oil market at a cost to them of close to 1 trillion dollars.  This clown is a genius!
4236 2018-08-08 16:47:35 The Saudis do not support solar energy.  Perhaps they hope to destroy #Tesla as to the extent possible - perhaps by diverting attention away from developing EV’s to fighting a takeover.  If they damaged Tesla, their oil would be worth far more.

4239 2018-08-08 16:47:24 @DrGundry 

1) Which colored sesame seeds should we be eating? 

Also, a brand of sesame oil (Kadoya) uses a mix of white, black, and brown sesame for their oil. Is that ok?

2) Regarding Tahini, are both mechanically and ground hulled sesame seeds okay?

3) Is coconut cream ok?

4246 2018-08-08 16:46:55 Canada showed lack of diplomacy by using a public tweet instead of 1st expressing views to Saudi officials. But this is an opportunity to cease reliance on Saudi oil. Build our pipelines for Canadian & US markets & no more aid to Saudi or middle east countries who sided with them
4247 2018-08-08 16:46:49 เกลียดการขีดทับ555
4248 2018-08-08 16:46:39 When are we going to understand that green energy is not just a question of the environment but of national security? If the EU and the USA don’t want to piss off Saudi Arabia is because of the oil. Period.
4249 2018-08-08 16:46:37 It’s called peace rose oil by shea moisture, it’s thick as hell but makes my face so soft and smells like roses

4251 2018-08-08 16:46:25 conditioner is supposed to like make sure your hair doesn't lose the essential oils after shampooing... coconut oil: is oil. i am not a very logical person
4252 2018-08-08 16:46:22 And once the world moves away from oil, you will have no profits from it. Of course, then you will still have your hotels in other countries & your prostitution farms, but once the world nationalises or closes them, you'll have nothing. Including water.

4255 2018-08-08 16:46:13 seriously Saudi Arabia is mad at Canada over us accusing them of human right abuses ,big fucken deal .Maybe if they stop treating women like dogs or second class citizens this wouldnt have happened .The western world is afraid to say anything because of OIL
4256 2018-08-08 16:46:09 I just watched an ad for an oil/serum ONLY skincare routine and I could feel my pores clogging
4257 2018-08-08 16:46:04 how long before they start doing oil changes and tire rotation while you wait

4260 2018-08-08 16:45:38 Somehow our leaders on both sides are so addicted to Saudi $ & oil, we turn a blind eye.
4261 2018-08-08 16:45:32 It’s hard for me to understand why it’s taking 3 hours for an oil change and tire balance when I was the second person at the store this morning.   @pepboysauto unacceptable I will not do this again

4266 2018-08-08 16:44:58 Screw that noise. Time to dissociate ourselves permanently from that retrograde terrorist nation. Yes there will be a cost but not as much as when that insignificant place runs out of oil. We should be even tougher.
4267 2018-08-08 16:44:56 Is there an essential oil that will make people leave me alone?
4268 2018-08-08 16:44:48 Wrong.  viable seeds are cold pressed to make hemp seed oil. Non viable seeds have no nutritional value
4269 2018-08-08 16:44:46 Of course that is what you were told. KSA is a propaganda machine for a dictator. Better agree with it or lose your hands or your head or get a flogging, or if you're a women, be stoned. The entire world knows you lead in nothing except oil profits.

I always told my car how good of a girl she was and motivated her not to break down , but I never put oil in her, and drove her without coolant once.. & now she’s dead so ya
4272 2018-08-08 16:44:37 Quite possibly. Although there will now be a focus on import substitution and local manufacturing. However, I can see many regime insiders trying to smuggle oil out of the country to beat sanctions. It is estimated that 40% of the #Iranian economy is underground.
4273 2018-08-08 16:44:36 I always thought olive oil was good for ya.  Apparebtly its terrible. They say use vegetable broth instead. But if you can avoid, skip that as well.
Im really confused here.

4277 2018-08-08 16:44:16  Piss OFF #Kingdom, thank you. #Canada should turn off the taps on all #SaudiArabia oil imports and immediately stop all exports of military hardware being used by #SaudiArabia in their #Yemen genocide #cdnpoli
4278 2018-08-08 16:44:08 They're hiding their inventories for a reason. I'm betting it's not because they are flush with oil.

4285 2018-08-08 16:43:37 after the US got off the silver standard the nixon administration offered saudi arabia military protection if it traded its oil in the USD. the "petro dollar". if the US military doesn't do what SA wants then the US dollar collapses... iraq, syria, iran, yemen

4291 2018-08-08 16:42:47 hemp SEED oil is rich in omega fatty acids & contains no Cannabidiol (CBD) should cost $12-16 per 1000 ml the crime is when this nutritional oil is marketed by a price that implies CBD content ie. $30-90 for 30ml this is the farmers market scam perpetuated by #hempworx and others

I think we won't get oil anytime soon  in Kenya...The levels are Tu-Low
4327 2018-08-08 16:39:29 It could be obtained from some sources. E.g when u compare total sales figures for Palm oil in the country compared with total production value/ volume  (i.e.local). The difference will most likely be imported . Though you could add some percentage error to that analysis.
4328 2018-08-08 16:39:22 The disastrous fate of countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somolia, Syria, and Iran leads us to believe that the discovery of oil is nothing but a curse. America has an unquenchable thirst for oil and they'd do anything to secure it.

4330 2018-08-08 16:39:15 On Saudi TV right now: apparently 75% of Canadian prisoners died before their trial between 2015 and 2017, and a guest "expert" said Canada had the world's highest rates of persecution of women. We should put a tariff on KSA oil to help us pay for re-educating their people.
4331 2018-08-08 16:39:08 Just got to Texarkana with @cameronbrister for a quick work trip.  I showed Cameron the fabulous Oil City on the way up.  He couldn’t contain his excitement.
4332 2018-08-08 16:39:02 The current situation is just a joke from top to bottom. Just what has happened to our club. The club that isn't an oil tanker or a plastic bag club. It's just heartbreaking to be honest just how bad things are right now
4333 2018-08-08 16:38:51 If Kidero is convicted in the same speed...i will for the first time be proud of my taxes! If not...they don't care about us! It is a musical game orchestra!
4334 2018-08-08 16:38:49 If I recall that was when oil prices were slightly lower. But regardless, what's happening now is volatility (bad!), not a gradual shift (okay in the right circumstances).

4338 2018-08-08 16:38:41 America has become an absolute joke. US shale is a perfect example. They not only have pumped themselves into being the biggest oil producer, they are also pumping themselves into bankruptcy. Whether it's mining or oil, one thing America is good at is producing for a loss.

4351 2018-08-08 16:37:27 Yup. Our country's provinces profess to be  cooperative then regional politics take over and we get barriers, delays and excuses. And of course Eastern Canada imports high cost foreign oil.

4360 2018-08-08 16:36:38 Strictly speaking, Curbelo's bill eliminates the federal fuel tax paid by oil companies because it's paid when withdrawn from terminal racks, not at point of consumer sale. "Would you support eliminating federal fuel taxes on oil companies in exchange for a new carbon tax?"

4368 2018-08-08 16:36:05 Talking about rising Gas prices? Just wait, Trump is Sanctioning the Iranian Oil Industry. That can only lead to Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz.

4385 2018-08-08 16:34:25 The climate has always been changing though, it’s a matter of what do you want to give up? Fuel for transportation ? All the byproducts of oil everyone uses? Personally, I don’t want to give up any of those and we couldn’t survive without fossil fuels. #drillbabydrill @tomcat_307
4386 2018-08-08 16:34:23 I’m with you there...too stupid to be virtue signalling...but it’s insanity to be buying foreign oil from anyone.
4387 2018-08-08 16:33:56 Build the trans east, we cant rely on terrorist blood oil and dictatorship oil (SAudi, Venezuela and friends).  Canada should not sell for $30, while eastern Canada pays terrorist $67 for dangerous product shipped by rail and super tanker.
4388 2018-08-08 16:33:52 Lol. More measures. Like what? Are they going to threaten to not sell us oil? What exactly does Saudi Arabia export that Canada doesn’t have in abundance already?

4393 2018-08-08 16:33:25 most of my dream last night was me trying to remember the part # for the oil pan gasket i need to fix my mustang
4394 2018-08-08 16:33:23 Oil changes are the worst experiences for girls, I might be clueless but can you talk to me like I’m not?
4395 2018-08-08 16:33:14 Putting on lotion feels like eating meat to me. Coconut oil changed my life.
4396 2018-08-08 16:33:05 My people don't parrel oil 
You want the oli only

4397 2018-08-08 16:32:59 nurse described my medication as being "like cooking oil" excuse me? i put that in my body
4398 2018-08-08 16:32:57 This tullow oil will be the end of northern Kenya.Expect terrorism to increase.
4399 2018-08-08 16:32:52 Can't be slick to a can of oil
4400 2018-08-08 16:32:51 Try tea tree oil
4401 2018-08-08 16:32:46 Distillate is fat soluble, I tried doing something similar at first and also had trouble getting it to blend. Dissolving it into a little coconut oil first really helps!
4402 2018-08-08 16:32:41 Dropped of my car for an oil change & Lord & behold one of the service advisors is an old colleague of mine when we worked at Nissan together. His oldest son just turned 12 & I remember when he was born. Time flies & Damn if we get older.
4403 2018-08-08 16:32:40 Yup. Everyone knows the 3% of climate change denying science is funded by the oil companies, but a lot of the 97% that proves it is funded by them too. They know what's up, they're just selling a different story to us.
4404 2018-08-08 16:32:33 Because they don’t change brake fluid with an oil change lol
4405 2018-08-08 16:32:30 We can live without them oil wise but what about universities, farmers etc.
4406 2018-08-08 16:32:22 No resources..... you really are thick! Oil, water, electricity, food produce, technology, whisky, gin, gold, at least try and tell the truth.....

US meddles in South america & causes humanitarian crises for its own gain theres plenty of proof
4411 2018-08-08 16:31:18 I hope that when the far left finally learns about how poorly Saudi Arabians treat their people and decide to back Canada and campaign to have us get involved in war, only they have to go so we can yell at them and tell them they’re just fighting over oil like they’ve done to us.
4412 2018-08-08 16:31:13 @LukeGromen As usual commodity investors try to justify why prices move. But the truth is the HFT War on Commodities continues to rage as they keep inflation under control by shooting the hostage. Hurting farmers, miners, oil producers, investors while helping Fed/Gov/Bonds #Pita
4413 2018-08-08 16:31:08 3 days without a car just for an oil change and a 30 minute

that is how i roll
4418 2018-08-08 16:30:31 Now is the time, the Canadian government must rise to meet the demand of the people. Let’s stand up and fight for what we deserve. Let’s bring Alberta’s oil to the Maritime provinces and global markets. Who is with us?!

4422 2018-08-08 16:30:27 If #RehamKhan stoops any lower she will discover oil reserves.
4423 2018-08-08 16:30:23 I realise it will never happen because they are such barefaced liars but I do wish some of the prominent snake oil sellers would come on at the same time and offer a solution to any issues raised.
4424 2018-08-08 16:30:23 How about the butchering of adult Orangutan's natural habitat in the growing of palm oil/palm fruit?
4425 2018-08-08 16:30:22 @Mithun_Chakrabo Dear Sir,  I am a Electrical Engineer having 11 years experience 2007-2018. I am struggling continuously but unable to survive against the opposite waves. I can give them oil but it is not in my blood work.  I need your help for establish myself.  Please help.
4426 2018-08-08 16:30:16 Only 100,000 barrels a day is 100,000 barrels to many ! We have an abundance of oil in our own country Wake up Eastern Canada
4427 2018-08-08 16:30:09 A fitting twist to the poem that Trump loves to quote in his speeches: "You knew damn well I was a snake oil salesman before you voted me in."
4428 2018-08-08 16:30:08 WE HAVE OIL people; we do need t need Saudi dirty oil

4433 2018-08-08 16:29:45 As you have tagged her now she will see it 
And nothing will still happen 
Steel workers are supposed to be the best paid 
But in Nigeria if it's not oil its rubbish 
This country is dead and gone

4436 2018-08-08 16:29:40 We have thousand of students from all over the world on waiting lists. The little oil we get from Saudi Arabia will be supplied by Canada or the US. They don’t matter.
4437 2018-08-08 16:29:39 Let me make something VERY clear

This account exists to help Men the same way other great Men helped me when I was younger

That does not include selling you shitty courses, affiliate marketing, or any “Get Rich/Get Girls Quick” snake oil schemes

Fuck that bullshit
4438 2018-08-08 16:29:29 And it's everything trump/gop/putin is fighting to prevent. It's a lot of money/oil, lol.
4439 2018-08-08 16:29:23 I do agree with the oil -what country does not use its own resources but buys from a country like Saudi then do the turn around &try  to tell Saudi’s how to run their country ?
4440 2018-08-08 16:29:18 Canadian oil makes sense as does Energy East......too bad neither won't happen under this @JustinTrudeau government #EthicalOil
4441 2018-08-08 16:29:17 Whats wrong with oil? You use it to power you car and bring you modern luxuries. Dont get it....
4442 2018-08-08 16:29:16 I don't think so. There is nothing as volatile as crypto. The oil market, which is by far the most fascinating, is more difficult to trade. Geopolitics and economic data can impact your EW count. In crypto, there is also less manipulation I guess.
4443 2018-08-08 16:29:09 I feel sorry for Pakistan cos they will be now on the USA lists of Countries to be invaded Doug so they can get there hands on the oil to keep there greedy Corporations happy
4444 2018-08-08 16:29:05 Apply almond oil before going to sleep.
4445 2018-08-08 16:29:05 You see why I love Motun so much?? You get better oil for your head
4446 2018-08-08 16:29:02 do you moisturize? i know it sounds weird but if your skin isn’t moisturized it produces extra oil to make up for the dryness
4447 2018-08-08 16:28:51 Smoking is bad for your health.  Make oil and infuse your food.
4448 2018-08-08 16:28:47 We can always rely on you to put things into perspective. A couple of immediate things do concern me. Oil for down east and Quebec how fast can energy east get this done? Our military for past several years they recruiting way down.
4449 2018-08-08 16:28:29 Even his snake oil is putrid.
4450 2018-08-08 16:28:27 The energy Death Star is built ~ OPEC et al. is going to buy @Tesla, then control EV demand through oil supply. Any thoughts? #askhalftime @HalftimeReport #cnbc $tsla $tslaq
4451 2018-08-08 16:28:26 Hillary. Supported. Fracking. 

She voted for oil drilling.

Don't blame Greens for not voting for an oil industry shill.
4452 2018-08-08 16:28:13 Like the beer?
4453 2018-08-08 16:28:13 And clean-burning whale oil
4454 2018-08-08 16:28:05 Not gonna happen. Quebec doesn't want Alberta oil under any circumstances. Just keep sending the cheques.....
4455 2018-08-08 16:27:54 Why did I just learn about using palm oil to spice chicken.  Chai! I've been missing

4461 2018-08-08 16:27:39 I need my oil changed so bad it’s insane
4462 2018-08-08 16:27:39 I made mistake of suggesting my Tanzanian/Ghanaian  ex use a bit less oil fearing the vegetables would suffocate Good thing I could cook
4463 2018-08-08 16:27:18 Nakakainis yung castor oil sa pilikmata ko!! Ang sakit sa mata. Naiiyak tuloy ako. 
4464 2018-08-08 16:27:17 I agree but the liberals along with soros  ,tide foundation and California invested a lot of money in @JustinTrudeau to shut down pipelines and oil sands in canada
4465 2018-08-08 16:27:15 Stew without oil flowing on it is just pepper .
You ppl need cooking education
4466 2018-08-08 16:27:14 And olive oil, don't forget the oil
4467 2018-08-08 16:27:13 The biggest worry I have for your country is that they could just cut off your oil supply. D:

Do you folks have a diversified energy supply?

(All the more the world needs to invest in renewables)
4468 2018-08-08 16:27:09 Maybe JT can grow a pair and build energy east and stop all Saudi Oil imports?  I won’t hold my breath.
4469 2018-08-08 16:27:03 I went to the gym and 5 minutes into my jog Spence says I have to take my car to the dealership to get an oil change at that very second. I go to my apartment gym and 5 minutes into THAT workout my sister calls saying Liam is up from his nap and I need to get back ASAP. 
4470 2018-08-08 16:26:57 Just added oil tariffs against us lol.

4472 2018-08-08 16:26:54 Where are the zebra crossings,1 has to search and if found it will not be aligned for it to convenient, also 3 riders no helmet is norm driving in opposite direction, 4 in a share  rickshaw from the Indian oil metro stop &the best part is police are never on this route to be seen
4473 2018-08-08 16:26:53 How come you don’t trade crude?? I thought you are active in it. Or you buy anything about oil?
4474 2018-08-08 16:26:47 Who cares about Saudi Arabia ; its a smaller country and we shouldn't even be selling them LAVs in the first place. We don't need their oil, so fuck them. I really don't understand the defensiveness. And Canada look incredibly lame because of the defensiveness...
4475 2018-08-08 16:26:46 I want to share this twitter acct. @AndersonTimoty so all women can be warned. This fake acct is private messaging you & asking you to buy him a iTunes card saying he's on an oil rig in the Gulf of mexico. Pls don't fall for this scam. He asks to be good friends then starts
4476 2018-08-08 16:26:34 In Nigeria, we deal with boko haram, corruption in Africa is just like buying and selling! Nigeria is so oil rich she can pay everyone $2000 per month ,but corruption will not let her be great. Do we get your sympathy? Hell no! You're just too selfish
4477 2018-08-08 16:26:26 I tak make up tapi kalau pakai pun i pakai makeup remover Simple tu je. For cleaning oil mmg i tak pakai plus i tak suggest pun anyone pakai cleansing oil sebab setengah orang pakai, nanti breakout :)
4478 2018-08-08 16:26:21 もうどっかいったわ…
4479 2018-08-08 16:26:20 Hillary supported fracking & oil drilling. How about Dems vote with Greens, that is identical to your statement. By your logic, a vote for democrats(instead of Greens) is a vote against democracy by way of reality. Blaming Greens for Dems' inadequacies is the worst take.
4480 2018-08-08 16:26:19 i thought about those pépito croc sablé biscuits full of palm oil and now i want to binge on them
4481 2018-08-08 16:26:14 Exactly!He’ll give tons of advice but never accepts even one.What Balaji said yesterday was right-Dani always adds oil to flames. If he doesn’t like some1,he’ll do whatvr it takes 2 make others hate them.We all r watching,Dani! #VivoBiggBoss #BiggBossTamil2 #BiggBossTamilSeason2
4482 2018-08-08 16:26:03 Q. How will CCS reduce our carbon pollution?
A. It won't. In fact we are using it to pull more oil out and pollute even more.

Q. How much cheaper is it than regular coal? Gas? Solar/wind?
A. Umm 4 times more than regular, twice as much as gas and look over there an eagle!
4483 2018-08-08 16:26:02 Hey Saudi Arabia, stop getting your panties in a bunch. Students from your country will be replaced by thousands of others from Canada or other countries currently on waiting lists. Canada and the US will supply the little oil we import from you. In short, you don’t matter.
4484 2018-08-08 16:26:00 Most cannabis beers on the market are brewed from barley and infused with marijuana oil, according to Dooma Wendschuh of Province Brands, the Toronto startup behind the product. "That's not what we do. Our beer is brewed from the stalks, stem and roots of the cannabis plant."
4485 2018-08-08 16:25:58 Exactly! Supply and demand forces will maintain the price of oil as a competitive energy source. As it remains the biggest export product of several nations.
4486 2018-08-08 16:25:49 Jobless and lazy youths if all this people are working you won't have such persons at the same place,how many bankers and oil and gas workers will leave their jobs to welcome him? And not get Fired
4487 2018-08-08 16:25:41 My sources say he takes bribes, but it's all in baby oil. It's the only way Alex can keep his sheen on screen. #ProveMeWrongJournalists
4488 2018-08-08 16:25:33 Crude oil getting killed...boy did I get that wrong.
4489 2018-08-08 16:25:26 Ive gone to get my oil changed for $15 and they rotated my tires and charged me $150
4490 2018-08-08 16:25:12 No country should grovel for forgiveness to a horrible country like Saudi Arabia. We should cut off all imports and trade from them, and buy elsewhere. We don’t need their oil, or frankly anything else from a country that still beheads women in 2018.
4491 2018-08-08 16:25:04 BTW: Since the Federal Government changed post election, our imports of Saudi Oil has increased from 87,000 Barrels per day to 102,000 barrels per day. Most destined for refineries in Quebec and Maritimes. #cdnpoli Preventable?
4492 2018-08-08 16:25:03 Crude Oil Prices are on the rise again after Trump warned the world that anyone who trades with Iran will not trade with the United States #TradeWars #ForexWithNtombi
4493 2018-08-08 16:24:57 Use the oil to cook your eggs.
4494 2018-08-08 16:24:29 Don’t use baby oil hun it’s not cruelty free x
4495 2018-08-08 16:24:27 Exemptions are not meaningful for a regime that is the biggest supporter of terrorism. If the US government exempts oil and banking sanctions, it is a partner in the protection of terrorism, and this is not forgiven.
4496 2018-08-08 16:24:23 And the policemen who just stood there will surely be put on the boiling oil
4497 2018-08-08 16:24:17 Salt could be added earlier, the only difference is that you've to stir water afterward.
Also, you can put in some olive oil drop.
4498 2018-08-08 16:24:12 they didn’t spill oil into the gulf it was brainwashing solution! it’s a HUGE conspiracy, and FAKE NEWS CNN won’t say a word about it!
4499 2018-08-08 16:23:51 When Duncan mighty said 

"If I break our heart na oil spillage
 I study this your love for freedom college" 

I felt that
4500 2018-08-08 16:23:49 have you tried coconut oil?
4501 2018-08-08 16:23:49 Anyone remember where the best node for oil is
4502 2018-08-08 16:23:45 The palm oil may likely not be coming in thru the official routes .
4503 2018-08-08 16:23:37 Bio oil.. but I think that’s hit or miss. Raw Shea butter
4504 2018-08-08 16:23:34 $CL_F China will take Iran’s Oil. It will still take some capacity out, but going for their currency & banking system is more effective than Oil IMHO. cc @realDonaldTrump

4508 2018-08-08 16:23:02 stick it in the oven with some olive oil on till it goes crispy, then mix it with salt and vinegar and eat it like crisps - sooooooooooooo good
4509 2018-08-08 16:23:02 Here is all you need to know..Saudi Arabia is oil and if it weren't for that no one would give a crap about Saudi Arabia. They are violent, oppressive and dictatorial. And USA needs to control them when needed. Need say anything more?

4510 2018-08-08 16:22:51 i need a meal completely cooked in cannabis oil or butter yo  rs
4511 2018-08-08 16:22:49 They had us try mixing prune juice with bmilk but it didnt work for us. Only the flaxseed oil helped! He was having problems from 4 months on
4512 2018-08-08 16:22:49 I hate getting my oil changed
4513 2018-08-08 16:22:47 Pay no attention to @proudsaudiman, he needs US help to try and rein in Iran... they are just oil drillers not fighters.. enjoy your money... but even with it.. you can't defeat Iran on your own...
4514 2018-08-08 16:22:41 Question I wish all centrist Dems were forced to answer: If I'm firmly not for corporate colonialism, using military and strong power to force open markets for oil, trade, cronies, intellectual property law enforcement, etc. what party do I vote for? It's neither D or R.
4515 2018-08-08 16:22:38 I work in the oil and gas Industry, if you think gas prices are higher now imagine if we shut the pipelines down daily. You know who also works overnights cops, drs EMTs... not just factory workers but hey what do you know
4516 2018-08-08 16:22:32 I told myself I was going to take today off and relax.
*gets oil changed
*buys groceries
*unpacks apartment

Maybe tomorrow 
4517 2018-08-08 16:22:10 Repubblica is great for when you have an oil spill on your garage floor. #LoStraccio
4518 2018-08-08 16:22:03 It says Kuwait has 105 billion barrels, so if this is more lets say 120 billion barrels.  Less than 4 years worth of world usage (about 34 billion barrels per year) But looking like the planet burns well before we burn all the oil available.
4519 2018-08-08 16:22:02 America has mines,oil another natural resources.private investors exploit them and lay taxes,why are we crying?what is this obsession we have with ownership,instead of an obsession with uplifting our people?
4520 2018-08-08 16:22:00 She did pretty well. Our crazy boy, Sneaky Snickerz, not so much lol cried the entire time. CBD oil calmed him a bit, but he had insecurity issues when we adopted him and doesn't do well with change.
4521 2018-08-08 16:21:53 It's foolish to artificially choke off up to 500,000 bpd of crude oil, regardless of its quality, when production is taking a 600,000 - 1 ml. bpd hit with Iran sanctions, Venezuela is bottoming out, outlook unclear for Libya, and wld. give bargaining power to Russia in China.

4524 2018-08-08 16:21:41 Did you run out of oil?
4525 2018-08-08 16:21:41 We don’t need anything from this country. With the future in mind and oil on its way out no need to support this silly country with their closed mindedness.
4526 2018-08-08 16:21:37 owwhh okay thank you kak,also klu muka rasa heavy cam feel melekit tu oil kan?

4529 2018-08-08 16:21:17 So this was good: chop up v. small half a green baby pumpkin & some yellow zucchini, bit of red onion, clove garlic & salt, saute w. olive oil until soft. Stir in a cup of heavy cream & 2 tbs tartufo paste; ladle generously over egg-papardelle & top with grated peccorino.
4530 2018-08-08 16:21:15 The Saudis are transitioning to tech as their future 'major' business dealings. Getting away from oil and slowly modernizing socially.

4537 2018-08-08 16:20:41 Lot of oil and fuel down at the scene of the incident. Unclear if we will continue tonight. There was only 20mins of that session left and it was the last session of the day #UGP
4538 2018-08-08 16:20:32 IN PROGRESS! Oil on 60cm x 90cm deep edge canvas. Sort of a commission!  I've done 3 different ones so far. Lots of texture.
4539 2018-08-08 16:20:28 Femi Otedola, has pledged to sponsor the education of Megabyte, an 11-year-old rapper.The Forte Oil CEO invited the young rapper to his office & described him as an “inspiration”. “This young man inspires me and I have decided to pay 4 his  education immediately

4540 2018-08-08 16:20:27 I did a scalp massage this morning with peppermint and tea tree oil forgetting how strong the smell is. Now I'm sitting in class and the two oil smells have taken over the classroom lmao.
4541 2018-08-08 16:20:19 I did not indicate oil smuggling
4542 2018-08-08 16:20:16 We should stop buying Saudi oil.  We have enough here if our Government can get it’s act together
4543 2018-08-08 16:20:15 Is this Saudi tantrum tied to oil & useful idiot? 
if he doesn't build a pipeline
he is done... if he does ... 
he can no longer "prefer" Saudi Oil... redundant though pumping cash into the UN was nice. 
Did he break a promise? 
Shocking 
Hence the CF-18s

4545 2018-08-08 16:20:12 Incidentally Muslims all over the world are pretty angry at seeing Arab states and Arab billionaires use oil wealth to export their Dubai architecture, their clothes and their education everywhere, destroying rich local traditions. Burka just one example
4546 2018-08-08 16:20:09 Equatorial Guinea could easily have been Africa's wealthiest (per capita) country. Large oil producer and small population. But no, a dictator (with western assistance) has had other ideas
4547 2018-08-08 16:20:07 #DidYouKnow thyme is a natural disinfectant and antiseptic due to the oil it contains called thymol. Simply add fresh thyme to boiling water and then, mix with a light, vegetable-based soap. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and use it to clean hard surfaces.

4551 2018-08-08 16:19:47 Anyway, back to the car thread..my dad most definitely taught me how to change tires and check my oil and other fluids before he even let me drive the car he bought me.
4552 2018-08-08 16:19:31 Oil pulling is no joke. People do this for 20 minutes everyday???? 
4553 2018-08-08 16:19:31 Oil down 4% today.. Brutal waterfall

4562 2018-08-08 16:18:23 i have to disagree with you on this one. i have seen medical marijuana work ! one of my friends has a little boy,he's ten i believe. and he has seizures off and on,and when he started to have one, she put ONE DROP of marijuana oil under his toungue,in3 minutes,he was normal again
4563 2018-08-08 16:18:11 @Rolandparis Now that the Saudi's are severing ties with Canada, could Canada lead an effort to boycott Saudi oil (similar to what @LeifWenar suggests in his book, Blood Oil)?

4570 2018-08-08 16:17:37 We know millions from the US has funneled into the paid activists who are now in the Left wing parties as part of the anti oil lobby. Pretty easy to determine the origin sources by looking at who benefits
4571 2018-08-08 16:17:33 I’m tired of beauty companies putting coconut oil in their products. It’s not 2016 anymore. We know it’s bad 
4572 2018-08-08 16:17:30 Trudeau & Libs can lie to us and MSM pals BS in support but we have 3rd largest oil reserves in the world. Energy East and Northern Gateway would make us independent of US & SA from where we import 65%. EE cancelled to save Lib seats

4592 2018-08-08 16:16:05 Do I exit $DWT green, wait for the final $WTI spike they say is coming on Iran sanctions, and get back in from a lower entry to short oil back to $60 or lower? Use capital for other things or hold cash near the ATHs? Hmmmm
4593 2018-08-08 16:16:01 รู้สึกเหมือนโดนเมินอ่ะ 555
4594 2018-08-08 16:16:01 Absolutely. We don't owe Saudi Arabia anything. In fact we should get off of their oil

I feel Nagy—I wish I could see the plays Sophocles saw/wrote—, but I think the world is equally… 'full' now.
4601 2018-08-08 16:15:26 Do SnP care about anything?   Oil, today, copper, bonds, the dollar, the Tsla freak show?   Thinking it will all matter at once, and if and when we hit a major air pocket

4606 2018-08-08 16:15:01 Is trading oil as profitable as crypto? Interested in it
4607 2018-08-08 16:15:01 So Saudi big oil supports short $tsla, then take over. Then Elon use shorts buy back to fight back with Saudi. Anything else more interesting?
4608 2018-08-08 16:14:59 I am oily, but I use a water cream as a daily moisturizer in the morning + sunblock, and then a retinol night oil + lactic acid moisturizer. 

The products are key pretty strong, so only once a week I do the full k-beauty routine with toner, essence, sheet mask, etc
4609 2018-08-08 16:14:49 Finally stopped hoeing around and got my oil changed
4610 2018-08-08 16:14:49 Look, I thought we were past sneaking coconut oil into facial cleansing products because that's honestly fucked up

4612 2018-08-08 16:14:34 In the year 2012, I used my first essential oil & I bought #lavender #essentialoil, just to add a few drops in my daily moisturizer. Back then I didn't know much about them & from then it slowly developed my interest!!!

4616 2018-08-08 16:14:18 Mustard oil in everything. Interesting fact: it’s not legal to sell that for human consumption in UK so it’s labelled as “not for consumption” but still sold in the food aisle of the ethnic shops.

4620 2018-08-08 16:13:58 Goes to show that the world is more concerned with oil than human rights. Trudeau needs to realize this. Keep your nose out of others houses unless you're perfect.

4624 2018-08-08 16:13:13 Is there such a thing as an ‘’oil entrepreneur’? Oil dinoseur surely.
4625 2018-08-08 16:12:50 Your country is based on a religion, one religion.  is for all. I can admit many  shortcomings & can opine on how KSA would be just another shithole theocracy if it did not sit atop oil.
4626 2018-08-08 16:12:42 I never thought about this, tbh? you could add a little extra oil if you want but honestly I wouldn't worry too hard about it, I made brown butter shortbread cookie and didn't notice a difference against my regular ones
4627 2018-08-08 16:12:40 So far summer oil plays not going exactly as planned. Big profits given up in #JOG and #UJO. #AAOG done well from placing although could be better. #CHAR decent though come back. #ECO stable. #RBD up a bit. #UOG stable/down. Still hold all of the above as catalysts not changed.

4639 2018-08-08 16:11:10 people may be terrified, but not of global warming. my solution, and @ClimateHuman is the only one ever acknowledging this as a good idea, is to put oil companies out of business. then we will all be reducing together.
4640 2018-08-08 16:11:02 going to make the effort to begin painting again. how i was able to stop and never pick up a brush again... i don't know, but it makes me sad and miss the smell of oil paints in the morning
4641 2018-08-08 16:11:00 They think our countries sit on a barrel of oil and just spending money  wake up guys and read the economic reports we r not in 70’s
4642 2018-08-08 16:10:59 looks like an excessively snug fit! -would it be worth oiling or greasing the pole? -maybe with olive oil or summat?
4643 2018-08-08 16:10:55 Daaeemmmm u ..... now it the Shampoooo after that coconut  oil 
4644 2018-08-08 16:10:54 Again who is "we"? I don't own an oil company do you? 

And if you want to call me stupid and then claim "we don’t even have enough production to meet our domestic needs" you should probably look it up first because that is an incredibly stupid and false statement.
4645 2018-08-08 16:10:54 Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil. I been peeped you out.
4646 2018-08-08 16:10:51 Rather hug a tree than an oil well.

4652 2018-08-08 16:10:21 Wow what a unique idea Never happen because our oil according to Liberal experts is dirty and unethical 
4653 2018-08-08 16:10:18 I regret the sudden economic impact of Saudi 's attack on Canada but the less we have to do with them the better. So much waste in military weapons and disruption and terrorism because they had oil and $
4654 2018-08-08 16:10:17 How much times i complain, as no action taken and they again say go to any place, no body will listen as every employee of Indian oil will listen only dealers not consumers.
4655 2018-08-08 16:10:15 No difference that I can tell so far. It’s my wife not consuming it for the baby who has sensitivities. 

Also cheap soybean oil in so many things or used for cooking in restaurants.

4663 2018-08-08 16:09:25 I use oil and I'd definitely use herb as well if it were legal. Every time I ask the GP to give me something for insomnia (which is severe due to PTSD), I get offered anti depressants ugh  Tried everything from CBT (therapy) to freaking chamomile lol
4664 2018-08-08 16:09:22 What year though? Cause 10k ain't much at all just gotta keep up with the regular maintenance and stuff. Oil change tire rotation minor stuff
4665 2018-08-08 16:09:07 You can't draw sad things if you're no longer sad :3
4666 2018-08-08 16:09:06 Wow.... I agree Canada should buy Canadian oil but NOT for the reasons you list !!!
4667 2018-08-08 16:09:05 Trump sucks up to Saudi Arabia because they are fucking Canada. Well things will go south for trump in 2020. Meanwhile, Canada will ride out the storm we Canadians have been thru worse. Tariff on oil exports to USA is still an option.
4668 2018-08-08 16:08:48 agree n build oil refineries to be self sustaining
4669 2018-08-08 16:08:40 Hi, what about make up remover / micellar/ cleansing oil? Mmg tak guna ke ? 
4670 2018-08-08 16:08:27 @nobmusiq masa where dey ma oil??
4671 2018-08-08 16:08:25 Dulu, no makeup makeup adalah sunscreen, foundie, concealer, pensil alis, blush on, lipstik (seringnya lipstik jadi buat blush on sekalian).

Kini, no makeup makeup hampir harfiah no makeup: sunscreen, oil, pensil alis, lipstik. Udah.

Hihiw.
4672 2018-08-08 16:08:18 thousands of Atlantic Canadians, some I personally know, spend thousands to get on a plane, leave their children and families to commute to Alberta oil at the same time we are pumping in Saudi oil to the east cost and allowing Russia to fuel the EU. When will we get serious?

4674 2018-08-08 16:08:15 (Repeat tweet)... “Simply put - Greenpeace is not being paid to protest the oil and gas industry anywhere else - just Canada.  
Here is a plan, we take up a collection, pay all Greenpeace members to go protest in Saudi Arabia...and see what happens .”
4675 2018-08-08 16:08:13 Ha! Why not? He’s grifted at least a billion off of the presidency so far by my tally. What’s a couple of oil shares, if they buy off an investigation?

4676 2018-08-08 16:08:13 Wash my face with Shea Moisture's Black African Soap and raw Coconut Oil as my moisturizer (a little goes a long way) everyday

Once a week I like to do a coconut oil with pineapple or mango extract sugar scrub.

Every other week I use raw aloe as a mask for about 30 minutes.
4677 2018-08-08 16:08:10 RT krassenstein: BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Rememeber this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault.
4678 2018-08-08 16:08:08 when its bill week, nails, hair, and toes need done, gotta buy school books, car need an oil change, AND your bank account gets hacked. its fine im fine 
4679 2018-08-08 16:08:05 It's really shocking Tim and the false claims jaw dropping. No way this should be allowed in Europe This isn't choice its snake oil sales dressed up as modern medicine

4687 2018-08-08 16:07:17 Starting the big move. Big shout out to Kevin from #Courtenay @jiffylube for use of his truck. Need an oil change? Go visit him. He’s not going anywhere today. I’ve got his wheels

4690 2018-08-08 16:06:57 I live in PA & there are thousands of ppl here who voted for him still waiting for the jobs he promised them. The coal mines & steel plants aren't reopening, maybe he's planning to start a snake oil factory to employ these people?

4697 2018-08-08 16:05:59 Hope this oil change don’t take all day
4698 2018-08-08 16:05:49 Hahahaha - even better - Now he started an Electric car company, solar panel company, Battery factory and has More interest  in Oil..... Thaks not playing..
4699 2018-08-08 16:05:44 And coincidence that he is on the House Energy Committee.@CNN @realDonaldTrump. Didn't you tax solar panels at the start of your term,pulled out of the Iran Nuclear deal , sanctioned Venezuela which caused a spike in oil and gas prices?.How much$$$$ was made?
4700 2018-08-08 16:05:31 Track the money and oil since 2003 leaving Iraq and you will be surprised how much of it goes to Iran , ironically this should dump the value of the Iraqi Dinar for years but it never ever has , stuck at its current level for many years , shows how much manipulated this is
4701 2018-08-08 16:05:25 I take responsibility 
4702 2018-08-08 16:05:22 Even worse ... he makes snake oil salesmen look honest.  
4703 2018-08-08 16:05:16 Nationalization allowed chavez to put his cronies in charge of it and then steal untold billions. Those billions could have financed things like improving the agriculture sector and diversifying the economy.

Also, keeping oil fields productive requires professionals who leave...
4704 2018-08-08 16:05:10 No, arrogance is when you think that the UK is in decline when it's constantly growing and has more exporting partners to growing economies such as Canada, Australia, India, China and African Nations, the UK has car, technology, oil, gas, food and clothing brands to offer.

4712 2018-08-08 16:04:39 Yup 100% agree especially for chromes etc, the issue is genuine medical need vs giving in to your nuffs and it just being fun to get high. 

But then that same issue arises with prescription meds as well. 

I know a few people here that use either oil or herb & it’s really helped
4713 2018-08-08 16:04:35 A mixture of water, tea tree oil and/ or jojoboa oil
4714 2018-08-08 16:04:31 We have to start acting like global business is a competition. For us to succeed we must pull together & play to win against all other oil producing nations. Right now we are defeating ourselves while the other teams/nations look on & gleefully eat our lunch!
4715 2018-08-08 16:04:19 Sa mga nagtatanong. We also sell good quality of diffusers and oils. This is not just your ordinary oils, it is 100% pure oil. One drop lang, sobra kayang maamoy sa buong bahay!
4716 2018-08-08 16:04:10 Fork whip salt and other flavorings in the vinegar before adding oil. A bit of mustard and a pinch of sugar. Oddly, a pea-sized bit of mayo helps the oil to mix in well.

4720 2018-08-08 16:03:56 Not sure about that. Very different economic pressures between the two, different context. Additionally, Turkey is a more mature economy so unlikely to evolve that way. A current account surplus would require a very deep recession given the size of the oil deficit

4725 2018-08-08 16:03:30 Absolute garbage. Saudi oil can be easily replaced and the US consumes over 20 million barrels a day and produces just over 10 million barrels a day. The US will never be the largest exporter of oil - the largest producer maybe but not the largest exporter.
4726 2018-08-08 16:03:20 I don't think you understand the way sa does business by bullying and crooked transactions.They are embedded with Iran,Russia and giant oil corporations who all bow down to the richest oil country in the world.If losing jobs is much more important to you than human rights,

I must confess that I wasn't up to now. It wasn't money he sent, but free heating oil. Moreover, I doubt that a one-time delivery of free heating oil more than a decade ago now really has much to do with the present...

To silence the young
Or shut women up in billowing tents.

4797 2018-08-08 15:57:23 I was thinking that too but that seems crazy like if you can’t braid with oil and leave-in in my hair you need to lower your prices.
4798 2018-08-08 15:57:22 The amount of ass hurt Saudis in the comments is hilarious, I hope your oil dries up soon
4799 2018-08-08 15:57:18 Trudeau should have allowed energy east if he was going to piss off a major supplier of oil.
4800 2018-08-08 15:57:12 มีเรื่องให้เครียดเยอะมาก จนไม่รู้จะเครียดเรื่องไหนก่อนดีอ่ะ 
4801 2018-08-08 15:57:00 Cortez used to live in the hemp fields but now he has a nice condo in miami thanks to cbd hemp oil marketed by amozonas ... buy azfl
4802 2018-08-08 15:56:42 Amazon had been putting Amazon's Choice branding on Alex Jones's snake oil?

That's pretty embarrassing.
4803 2018-08-08 15:56:32 You weren't aware of the his american heating oil program?

LMAO

Do you actually know anything about hugo chavez?
4804 2018-08-08 15:56:27 you're fkn kidding me right? a HUGE $250 a month ( $62.50/wk) gas is up .50+ per gallon, oil from $43 to $74, and electric 12.55 to 12.96..  bye bye $62.50/week and much much more. asshat
4805 2018-08-08 15:56:26 Meanwhile oil companies revenue are getting wrecked by your trade war. Well done
4806 2018-08-08 15:56:23 Complete scam artists. Caught trying to pour metal shavings into oil filter to pose like the engine was shot.
4807 2018-08-08 15:56:18 Ugh, the offshore oil drilling!
4808 2018-08-08 15:56:15 With this new fight with #SaudiArabia Canada MUST diversify it's oil exports and our oil/gas industry to switch from #SaudiArabia oil to our domestic supplies, we do need pipelines more than ever, the world is not a friendly place these days and it will only get worse #cdnpoli
4809 2018-08-08 15:56:11 #Libya#today "Human trafficking is the second-largest industry in Libya today, after oil." @tomfriedman
4810 2018-08-08 15:56:08 I always feel weird leaving my Jeep to get an oil change... like I hope he doesn’t feel like I’m abandoning him 
4811 2018-08-08 15:56:01 Horseshit. Snake oil. Lies.
4812 2018-08-08 15:55:57 “We bought castor oil same time yen yen yen”.  Mock me well. The time you cut it cos it was too long and full to handle nko.

I know I don’t take care of my hair but even if I did, it kent be like this.
4813 2018-08-08 15:55:51 Are you having fires as well? 
We tend to have a lot of rain in Tennessee.
If water is the next oil, we’re going to be fine!
4814 2018-08-08 15:55:48 It seems you don't like palm oil

Should I change it to 1 pack of knorr cubes?? 
4815 2018-08-08 15:55:47 Dr Pepper used to be Mr. Pepper until he tried Amozonas marketed cbd oil
4816 2018-08-08 15:55:39 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
4817 2018-08-08 15:55:35 is that not what you did when the oil money came in????
4818 2018-08-08 15:55:33 I'm guessing the 3rd vote which was "The King" is their dad
4819 2018-08-08 15:55:30 Level of hypocrisy - Justin Trudeau. It is not OK to arrest human rights activists by dictatorship, but it is OK for Canada to support that same dictatorship by buying oil from them.
4820 2018-08-08 15:55:23 ยังมีเพิ่มอีกเหรอครบยัง
4821 2018-08-08 15:55:23 Kfc Zinger Wings should be categorised With Castor oil & other Laxatives.

4825 2018-08-08 15:55:13 @officialEFCC needs the DSS treatment. Enough of impunity. Investigation of graft can be done without hurting the citizens. I think the aim is to pitch the people against govt. It's as simple as govt agency instigating security crises in the oil producing Niger Delta.
4826 2018-08-08 15:54:48 @JustinTrudeau Perhaps we should just refine and use our own oil and work to build a green economy. Saudi Arabia... 21'st century tech, 10'th century society. You don't think so. As an atheist I'd have my head chopped off in the public square.
4827 2018-08-08 15:54:45 Do you need a lift? Pray and try Bergamont Essential Oil on your pulse points. Pay attention to how your body responds. God created natural remedies to help us cope. @friendshipwest#strokes#healthyliving#WednesdayWisdom

4829 2018-08-08 15:54:28 Colfax County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
4830 2018-08-08 15:54:26 Remember when brutal dictators in Iran, China, Russia and Kings of the middle east had us by the you know what over oil. Those days are over thankfully due to republicans and Trump. We are the new Gods of oil and the world will be a better place because of it.
4831 2018-08-08 15:54:21 The best kind of grind - one with lots of oil at the end!
4832 2018-08-08 15:54:16 I hate going to get an oil change cuz the mechanics always talking bout how my car bout to break down. Mf it's been about to break down for 3 years and still going.
4833 2018-08-08 15:54:15 I didn't win nothing lol but a lower gas price is nice I guess
4834 2018-08-08 15:54:15 We have the oil and the sun don’t worry we are prepared
4835 2018-08-08 15:54:05 And yet we still import 50% of our oil form th is
4836 2018-08-08 15:54:04 Fuck Saudi Arabia, let them drown in their oil. Along with Iran. We need to stop supporting terror regimes.

4838 2018-08-08 15:54:01 I wonder if the Snake Oil vendor is there
4839 2018-08-08 15:53:57 fish oil does wonders
4840 2018-08-08 15:53:56 google search find CBD oil in germany because i’m an anxious mess
4841 2018-08-08 15:53:50 Congratulations
4842 2018-08-08 15:53:34 A snake oil Atty calling someone a snake oil salesman is funny! Too bad @MichaelAvenatti is going to be a trivia answer soon, nothing else
4843 2018-08-08 15:53:28 oil treatments really work
4844 2018-08-08 15:53:27 Lol, I trust KDB tho, buh I fink Oil might not show up
4845 2018-08-08 15:53:20 Never doubt the ability of a snake oil salesman to make a decent living.
4846 2018-08-08 15:53:15 Time for Canada to retaliate and shut down the Saudi oil imports, as much as I hate this I agree with @PremierScottMoe to use Canadian oil/gas, we don't need #SaudiArabia oil @cdnpoli
4847 2018-08-08 15:52:54 Dm me
I owe you one bottle of palm oil for this
4848 2018-08-08 15:52:53 Oh boy, seems like "Akpabio" is pulling so much crowd.. So much unemployment in my state,  an oil rich state..gosh. @omalicious1

4850 2018-08-08 15:52:43 Pakistan's future is looking brighter by the day. It's all powered by a new and progressive incoming civilian government, a geopolitical shift to the East, the potential of newly discovered oil deposits and its participation in the New Silk Road Initiative.
4851 2018-08-08 15:52:41 But it would still be outside of Chicago. It's not like an oil painting you can take home.

4854 2018-08-08 15:52:29 Sweet potatoes are lovely.  Sweet potatoes enchiladas are nice. We make sweet potato salad (we call them achaar in Nepali) with toasted sesame, chilies, lemon juice and mustard oil.

4856 2018-08-08 15:52:09 Before, you have to get all that oil out of your mouth again to really get rid of the bacteria
4857 2018-08-08 15:52:06 @OntarioNewsNow what a joke, who believes this crap what a snake oil salesman!
4858 2018-08-08 15:52:00 Gas reserves are immense along with oil here in Kohat district, Karak district and in Baluchistan as well, people of Pakistan need honest leadership to benefit from all these resources, public service at levels through honest and educated can bring pleasant change.

4860 2018-08-08 15:51:52 OIL WORLD editor Thomas Mielke will be interviewed today on #CNBC TV, 3pm ET, on the hot topic:
The #soybean market amidst the US-Chinese trade war. Might be interesting!
4861 2018-08-08 15:51:46 You think anyone’s actually listening though? Canadians should be outraged that we import 15% of our oil from SA instead of using Canadian production. Instead, crickets...
4862 2018-08-08 15:51:44 Oil is the best highlight
4863 2018-08-08 15:51:44 Looool.. haba I don't cut it Everytime nah. You sef know my struggles.. we bought castor oil same time nah
4864 2018-08-08 15:51:36 Imperialism wants the OIL?
4865 2018-08-08 15:51:27 So Tesla would be funded by Big Oil?  Is that the plan?   Elon Musk + Trump + King Salman = Irony.
4866 2018-08-08 15:51:19 Not yet! I actually don't have a lot of access to concentrates round here.  But I'm glad the pax has that option. I'll try it out eventually  how do you prefer to use it? With flower or oil?
4867 2018-08-08 15:51:18 You seriously are a moron. I made one statement at the very beginning of this “energy easy was not planned to service domestic oil needs in the east” you apparent have issues with tense confusion. I never ever once made a statement that a pipeline could not or should not
4868 2018-08-08 15:51:18 when i got out of school i almost took the foreign service officer exam but then i realized you have to like, orchestrate coups and shit for oil company executives and i was like well maybe that's not for me
4869 2018-08-08 15:51:17 Creo que fue sólo una feliz coincidencia. Gracias por leerlo. Saludos.
4870 2018-08-08 15:51:16 Οι μουναρέτες αγοράζουν baby oil για να το απλώνουν σε slow motion στα κορμιά τους για να είναι ακόμα πιο απαλές. 
Εμείς τα μπάζα αγοράζουμε baby oil για να αφαιρούμε υπολείμματα κόλλας από αντικείμενα και επιφάνειες.
4871 2018-08-08 15:51:14 How often do you deny science? Is it just for this one thing that a politician told you to? You trust corporate leaders and politicians getting rich off of oil instead of scientists and scholars around the globe and you dare speak of reason?
4872 2018-08-08 15:51:04 It’s fucking madness. Our club has done EVERYTHING the right way over the past 4 odd years. No oil money pumped into the club, gradual improvement, beautiful fluid football. They’ve even trained themselves into hating arguably the most likeable manager on earth. Bunch of weirdos
4873 2018-08-08 15:51:00 Crude Oil reversing off the lows and autotrader nails it.
4874 2018-08-08 15:50:59 Oil buy at 66.50
Target you decide.
Own Risk.

4875 2018-08-08 15:50:55 Lack of access to markets suppresses the price of Alberta oil. Pipelines to tidewater would service a new Chinese client. Suncor didn't want to wait.
4876 2018-08-08 15:50:48 Literally only oil and spices. Nothing that makes a meal.
4877 2018-08-08 15:50:44 2/.  Except when it comes to RomneyCare/ObamaCare, then they think having our currency issuer fund private corps is socialism.  But not funding oil subsidies 
4878 2018-08-08 15:50:37 Again I think it should be looked at what the difference in the quality that India and China buy. The narrative is now US oil but a lot to India is medium Sour Mars. US production growth is not based on this type of crude though.
4879 2018-08-08 15:50:36 I better get some oil !
4880 2018-08-08 15:50:36 bukan jarang. ni first time trade ni ha. gara2 kau la ni asyik ckp pasal oil. tu aku buat analysis simple je tu. tup tup profit dah.
4881 2018-08-08 15:50:27 Why bro changing my oil with attitude..yea I’m watching y’all
4882 2018-08-08 15:50:21 Try argon oil , shea moisture for the scalp this really works. Also you can use some coconut shampoos and conditioners also. That's what I use
4883 2018-08-08 15:50:19 I am a Canadian citizen and I am 100% in support of Chrystia Freeland and Government of Canada for their position. Saudi's position is rude and too aggressive. Oil Sheiks and desert rats have become bold and too fat, sitting on ocean of oil by chance.
4884 2018-08-08 15:50:16 
4885 2018-08-08 15:50:07 What is new in this any person with little political interest knows this. India Pakistan division is happens because both of them were PM aspirant.  By knowing this Britishers played the rest of the roll by pouring oil on fire.
4886 2018-08-08 15:50:05 
4887 2018-08-08 15:50:03 On a sidenote, isn't it great for Canada the Oil Price is getting creamed the same day Saudi Arabia is selling Canadian assets?  KARMA IS A BITCH!
4888 2018-08-08 15:50:02 People are so funny “cooking at home is cheap” Yeah if you already have all the appliances, tools, spices, and oils. People will leave the grocery store and say they only spent 60 dollars for the week but neglected to say they already have olive oil, pepper, oregano, etc at home
4889 2018-08-08 15:49:43 He’s driving a 44tonne oil tanker . Should be fine ?
4890 2018-08-08 15:49:31 Never fails, everytime I come get an oil change These men always tryna finesse me outta another service.
4891 2018-08-08 15:49:27 On a sidenote, isn't it great for Canada the Oil Price is getting creamed the same day Saudi Arabia is selling Canadian assets?  KARMA IS A BITCH!

4896 2018-08-08 15:49:14 Oil down....someone is getting punished
4897 2018-08-08 15:49:13 If this is true, I will create an new cocktail. "The Saudi" - 2/3 Kool-Aid, 1/3 Snake Oil, shake, serve steaming hot with a sprinkle of fairy dust. $TSLA
4898 2018-08-08 15:49:12 5 billions until 2030 doesn't seem unaffordable to me. Probably NL spends more on oil and gaz in one single year!
4899 2018-08-08 15:49:04 It amazes me how people still do fresh oil and chips on roads it is the absolute fucking stupidest thing ever.

4901 2018-08-08 15:49:00 Snake oil salesman works, but I prefer Con Man, really. Con men are usually psychopaths, which is the reason they can actually con people: there is no emotional cue to lying among psychopaths. And that's what the #deplorables put in power.
4902 2018-08-08 15:48:54 I will not Apologise to you , because the words you speak could harm yet more people. You sell snake oil in your tweets and blog that can be shown to be economic bullshit... but you keep pushing it without event looking at the evidence against it.
4903 2018-08-08 15:48:45 Or, stealing most of the Oil revenue, letting your state oil co. flounder & not invest in keeping productive, failing to diversify your economy, sending $ to poor americans to spite bush, giving money to cuba instead of investing in your agriculture sector etc

Chavez was evil
4904 2018-08-08 15:48:45 You better leave this silly people and their silly ways. 

Both sides of them. 

Please where is crude oil price going?
4905 2018-08-08 15:48:45 Τα υπολείμματα κόλλας αφαιρούνται με baby oil. 
Χρήσιμο tip για αντικείμενα που δεν σηκώνει να βάλεις οινόπνευμα ή ασετόν. 
Να το πω κι αυτό να το μάθετε.
4906 2018-08-08 15:48:44 I just entered Texas and George W. Bush is standing in the middle of the highway and making everyone stop to drink one pint of oil before letting them through and it’s really slowing things down. Very inefficient.
4907 2018-08-08 15:48:38 หิว
4908 2018-08-08 15:48:37 LOL! you even faked this, ahahahahaha! you lead tainted snake oil salesmen are the best.

4911 2018-08-08 15:48:26 How cool is this company @DandelionEnergy? Affordable Earth-powered heating for every home. Geothermal energy is more efficient than gas furnaces and oil furnaces.  Each year your system is up and running it is the equivalent to removing almost two cars from the road.
4912 2018-08-08 15:48:24 Working with oil pastels today...let’s pray it doesn’t make too much of a mess
4913 2018-08-08 15:48:19 The oil from your skin makes the screen greasy, so I don’t.

4916 2018-08-08 15:48:07 Good news: ryan bought me an essential oil defuser for my birthday and I’m SO EXCITED TO USE IT
4917 2018-08-08 15:48:01 @realDonaldTrump  great job getting China to place a tariff on oil, BNO is down over 3%.
4918 2018-08-08 15:48:00 Ofc the one day I try to get an oil change done and the sears in Taunton is by appointment only. 
4919 2018-08-08 15:47:54 Because we know more about oil than you
4920 2018-08-08 15:47:52 Coconut oil- massage it on your scalp, let sit for 15-30 mins then rinse out with warm water.
4921 2018-08-08 15:47:49 Crude oil is in 66's
4922 2018-08-08 15:47:49 People are silly, why would i oil the bottom of my feet? So I can slip & die 
4923 2018-08-08 15:47:35 oil! you go!
4924 2018-08-08 15:47:35 Also, stop worrying about it. We're melanin'd and the oil makes up for the lack of sunscreen we take for granted.

I gave up fretting and I'm au naturale.
4925 2018-08-08 15:47:34 Snake oil salesmen  + POTUS = IPOTUS (illegitimate President)
4926 2018-08-08 15:47:24 Yeah I remember seeing some of those videos. Feel like Filthy Frank or Maxmoefoe or someone like that mentioned him. Think I saw a video of him drinking motor oil. That's more frightening to me than anything.
4927 2018-08-08 15:47:23 Our land grant is Whittier Narrows specifically HASCO OIL FIELDS #Montebello #stolen
4928 2018-08-08 15:47:18 I know how to acknowledge when I'm wrong.  I didn't see the chart was pertaining to oil.  I thought it was referring to the market..SPX, Dow, etc.  Big oil drop today so it appears she nailed it.
4929 2018-08-08 15:47:16 Lol!
4930 2018-08-08 15:46:58 Just got oil all over a cream tee n its safe to say am pissed
4931 2018-08-08 15:46:57 Fighting laziness and trying to stay discipline is like trying to climb a wooden staircase with olive oil
4932 2018-08-08 15:46:56 Um...
Obama removed Poland's missile defence against Russia. Trump put it back.
Obama gave Ukraine MRE's.
Trump gave them weapons.
Trump is in favor of increased oil production, hurting Putin. Obama opposed it.
So, who outsourced our foreign policy?
4933 2018-08-08 15:46:55 True but YOU padded our military budget with too much pork and sold out our environment to big oil. Appreciate the report. Try being candid and honest, sir.
4934 2018-08-08 15:46:49 President Trump I got a real good idea, if they don't give you the money for the wall let's dig a ditch 50 ft deep, 50 foot wide by the border and put all our used oil and garbage from all cities in the ditch and set it on fire! Pt. 1
4935 2018-08-08 15:46:47 My scalp dry up so fast I can drown myself n oil and my scalp will be dry as hell 2 mins later
4936 2018-08-08 15:46:43 I go 5 big banks here now, 11 yrs ago set to do a strategy 15 more yrs later it'll still be the same. I can either get things changing, like oil to battery cars.
4937 2018-08-08 15:46:34 You have this completely backwards. America exports oil into China. China is now slapping a 25% tax on this & other American products. This will make American oil more expensive to the Chinese so they will buy from elsewhere, like Canada or Russia.
4938 2018-08-08 15:46:32 I believe they let it happen.THE MORNING JOE REPUBLICANS, SO THEY COULD GO IN AND OCCUPY OIL RICH COUNTRIES! And embezzled BILLIONS FOR 17 YEARS. 28 BILLION + TO PACKISTAN AND BEN FUCKHEAD WAS DOWN TOWN NEXT TO POLICE FOR PROTECTION? REALLY? A CONSPIRACY alright!
4939 2018-08-08 15:46:25 I got  thai oil in my eye yesterday. Exhilarating!
4940 2018-08-08 15:46:11 Better put some coconut oil on that thang
4941 2018-08-08 15:45:59 looks like oil clay?
4942 2018-08-08 15:45:59 Putin *who never lies* must've told Jill Stein he would ensure environmental protection, even as he grabbed control of every oil co. linked to Russians
4943 2018-08-08 15:45:48 I just Googled oil pulling because I had never heard of it.
4944 2018-08-08 15:45:44 If Saudis finance going private for Tesla would they try to shut it down in the future bc of their oil or are they following their long game of investing in renewables?
4945 2018-08-08 15:45:37 Yeah. They could've phrased that a lot better. "We did the oil change, but found some other things that need to get taken care of."
4946 2018-08-08 15:45:36 S.A. Will get what they want. Trudeau will get on his knees and beg forgiveness.  If it wasn't for their oil, S.A. can offer the world nothing of value.  Eastern Canada needs to stop buying their oil now!
4947 2018-08-08 15:45:35 If anyone has photos of the fire that took place this morning at Arlex Oil on the Middlesex Turnpike and would like to share them with the Minuteman, please forward them along to jcollings@wickedlocal.com.

4949 2018-08-08 15:45:35 Trump isn't a "snake oil salesman". He is Ponzi's step-child.
4950 2018-08-08 15:45:27 [Thread] November 4 will mark the end of the 180-day wind down period and the beginning of U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil and energy-related sector.
4951 2018-08-08 15:45:27 In Pennsylvania Trump alluded to a US attack in Feb-where 500 Russian mercenaries were decimated to protect Delta force military contractor/ mercenaries, Kurds & Arabs that had illegally seized a Syrian oil refinery. So now they are fighting each other to steal Syria's oil #qanon

4956 2018-08-08 15:45:07 @FairFuelUK Oil down nearly 4% today.  I wonder how long it will take to see this reflected at the pumps?
4957 2018-08-08 15:45:06 1- The Saudi government is controllable, Iran is not. frankly, it's Iran that doesn't want a relationship with US; Iran and its revolutionary mindset is against US interest. Remember when Pahlavi tried to threaten the west and acted on it with oil and its power...
4958 2018-08-08 15:45:00 Talking to @meghangordon later today about Colorado's ballot measure to create buffer zones between oil and gas activity and occupied buildings for the @CapitolCrude podcast. Looking forward to the discussion.
4959 2018-08-08 15:44:49 His snake oil is poisonous to everyone. It cause division hatred for those he doesn't like.
4960 2018-08-08 15:44:48 Canada = G7 country with more than enough oil to supply itself and the USA for a century.   Standing up for human rights > Bowing to a terror state

4961 2018-08-08 15:44:42 Try doing hot oil treatments on your hair after you wash it. I use mix of coconut oil & olive oil and apply it to my scalp with my deep conditioner. Let it sit for 30 min to an hour then wash it out. Or you can try rice water also, plenty of YouTube videos about it.
4962 2018-08-08 15:44:37 The day is coming when fresh water will be far more valuable than oil.
4963 2018-08-08 15:44:22 2) Some Americans (white/black/brown) had never been taught how to shop for/store fresh meat, dairy, produce. Some didn’t own salt, cooking oil, pots, pans, containers. Really. Even a bare bones pantry costs $$$. So, maybe we need to stop shaming people and start with basics
4964 2018-08-08 15:44:18 seasoning it with garlic,basil,oregano,olive oil,parmasean cheese mmm.
4965 2018-08-08 15:44:16 I am a Canadian citizen and I am 100% in support of Chrystia Freeland and Government of Canada for their position. Saudi's position is rude and too aggressive. Oil Sheiks and desert rats have become bold and too fat, because they are sitting on ocean of oil by chance.
4966 2018-08-08 15:44:08 I just learned how to check the oil in my car and now I’m a mechanic 
4967 2018-08-08 15:44:04 How are those new tariffs on oil and steel expected to impact Michigan?  How’s that drinking water situation working out?
4968 2018-08-08 15:44:02 Right I’m off, my class is about to arrive. 
Vangogh still life with oil Pastels for my 1st graders. I’m so excited

4970 2018-08-08 15:43:50 Hey @fordnation can you order oil companies to set minimum gas price at $0.50/L? They won't listen to you either but its good press. #TOPoli

4973 2018-08-08 15:43:25 Oil = 45% of  #SaudiArabia 's GDP and 90% of their exports so if we want to mess with their drive to diversify their economy Canada should shout out loud to the world to let them know what will happen to their investments when the little of a  gets a hissy fit #cdnpoli
4974 2018-08-08 15:43:24 Take some time today to make sure you are ready for band classes to start! 
1) Oil and grease your instrument
2) Make sure you have several good reeds to rotate 
3) Locate or print off a new copy of the Cole Chorales (SB and WE only)
4) Make sure sticks/mallets are in good shape
4975 2018-08-08 15:43:24 You’ll have to talk to the Irvings about that. ‘Canada’ doesn’t import oil. Private companies do.
4976 2018-08-08 15:43:17 @lauragzzi this is literally what I was talking to you about the other day #psychic #oil #alexlongleyexpert
4977 2018-08-08 15:43:17 Also ignore the fact we just killed 536 Russians in Syria, we’ve imposed massive sanctions, expelled Russians from out country, he smashed Germany got spending billions to get oil from Russia.  Maybe pay attention and you won’t get blindsided again
4978 2018-08-08 15:43:08 Kind of off subject, but have you heard that CBD oil helps with seizures?  It helps with insomnia too.  Two people in my family are taking it with great results.  Love ya!
4979 2018-08-08 15:43:07 Exactly exactly, and not as tooth paste but for oil pulling :)

4983 2018-08-08 15:42:49 My job has us wearing these matching shirts got us looking like we about to perform discount oil changes.
4984 2018-08-08 15:42:46 We taxpayers subsidize oil companies, war contractors, Walmart’s payroll. We subsidize (merely to prop up) the health insurance industry (a completely redundant entity). We even aid the rich via tax breaks. We ought to be using these funds toward the labor force not management.
4985 2018-08-08 15:42:36 “BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Rememeber this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault.”

4987 2018-08-08 15:42:30 When I was a mechanic in Houston I worked next to a black female mechanic in the same Bay. Everyday she called me over to help her break loose oil filters on diesel engines. She got the same pay as me but I always had to do extra work on her side. How is that fair?
4988 2018-08-08 15:42:10 What lesson?? Saudi Arabia has one resource.. Oil. Who cares about a little barren country with little economic power.
4989 2018-08-08 15:42:05 Oil and whiskey and buying flags none of which r available at food banks but apparently r vital
4990 2018-08-08 15:42:05 Facts are no match for Donald, especially when he is at the podium on his soapbox. Donald is a prefect fit for the GOP, he is the face of your party. Remarkable and incredible snake oil salesmanship. What a big talent he offers for misleading and misinforming the voters of today.
4991 2018-08-08 15:41:58 You seem to buy into snake oil.

"You can fool some of the people all of the time"
4992 2018-08-08 15:41:46 That’s my thought process too. The US is rather quiet on the whole thing. The « invade country X » to restore democracy (ahem oil) was already laughable; it is even more now that they sit on the sidelines while Canada calls out Saudi Arabia. Our reality is laughable, all puppets
4993 2018-08-08 15:41:39 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
4994 2018-08-08 15:41:39 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4995 2018-08-08 15:41:38 I know it's counter-intuitive - but thinking globally, withholding supply is ineffective at reducing emissions. Oil-importing countries will buy their oil elsewhere: if I buy all my groceries at my local Safeway, and it shuts down, I won't starve. 1/2
4996 2018-08-08 15:41:31 @realDonaldTrump Hi I am Kaveh  Naji Parsaeian  recently I have invented a fire extinguish system that can extinguish much horrid fires (California fire) oil and gas wells and refineries at minimum time and expenses I have seen the California fire in news sure job can be done.
4997 2018-08-08 15:41:29 He’s also previously told us that he doesn’t take the medication he’s been prescribed,that we’ve religiously collected for him, as he has more faith in cannabis oil  
Anyway, he has just knocked at my door to let us know that he is going into a hospice tomorrow, & I am in bits.
4998 2018-08-08 15:41:27 I guess they also never heard that karma is  a  b*tch.  They have oil and............................ still waiting...... we have oil, food, tech.

5002 2018-08-08 15:41:07 Several countries have condemned that election, several of their neighbours plus Canada.
Over reliance on oil has been their downfall. Some investment in renewable energy would be exceedingly useful now, but wasn't done.Maduro continues to consolidate power, emigration continues.
5003 2018-08-08 15:41:01 Your short was very timely. Touche! (This could be a minor pull back prior to a leg up, we will see. At least my oil short is working out).

5018 2018-08-08 15:39:39 Is it though? Or is it paint thinner and lawnmower oil like in those 70s public information films where kids drink bleach out of old R Whites lemonade bottles and die grisly deaths?
5019 2018-08-08 15:39:26 Why tell me to come to the shop at 1130 and ray still not here. I just want the ac fixed and an oil change so I can go back to my cold room

“It’s going to be $24 ”

...really? Why are you being so dramatic with this? Just do it idc.

5044 2018-08-08 15:37:51 we definitely agree on the need for coordinated reduction/elimination of oil consumption—i think we diverge re: the urgency of that need as a vital component of what “socialism” is or can become
5045 2018-08-08 15:37:48 More countries with conscious should support Canada. Let the backward idiots with too much money and oil but with brains and morals from the 7th Century truly feel what economic and political isolation really is.

5048 2018-08-08 15:37:43 I would think so, they remove the element that creates the “high” and it is an oil so it is used sublingually.
5049 2018-08-08 15:37:33 One US linked Business Channel  showing live that crude fell about 2%, where as paid  bimbos/ Bimbans on its local Bull Shit channel darating their masters line that  "Oil is on Boil" with sanctions on Iran?!. 5th rate media is insufferable even in that little time one views.
5050 2018-08-08 15:37:30 the world doesn`t really need Saudi Arabia. Oil is everywhere and electric cars are more and more popular. Saudi economy needs foreign investment to modernize their one-horse economy and making an enemy of Canada certainly won`t help them.
5051 2018-08-08 15:37:30 We didnt need to. But we were and instead of ramping up our own oil output this is a good excuse to diversify our energy sources and build more jobs in the next growth sector, green energy.

Surely you jest?
5055 2018-08-08 15:37:13 Saudi’s are pricks.  T2 is a blithering idiot. I certainly ‘side’ w/T2 on this, but only because the saudis are such twatwaffles. We can replace the oil (if QC ‘would ‘let’ us). But the loss of $400m student $ is going to hurt.
5056 2018-08-08 15:37:08 Lemongrass oil. That shit will take nail polish off too
5057 2018-08-08 15:37:06 Importing more US oil will do away with the Canadian trade surplus with the Americans. That ought to be fun at the NAFTA table.

5059 2018-08-08 15:36:59 Covering the 'where's the money angle' is much like giving "both sides a fair venue". One side is a liar, and we have evidence some of them are sock puppets funded by oil interests. We have evidence others of them are simply oil traders.

5076 2018-08-08 15:35:57 Notable move on oil today.

5079 2018-08-08 15:35:34 The only essential oil
5080 2018-08-08 15:35:23 This seems like a very extreme reaction by the Saudis. Although I think it will be a catalyst to getting our oil out east as it should have been all along, I have to wonder just how terribly people are being treated there. Where there’s smoke, there’s usually fire!
5081 2018-08-08 15:35:23 oil aged. like milk
5082 2018-08-08 15:35:15 Do we run on whale oil any longer? Nope

Why? Because greed killed off the resource just as it has done in both coal and gas/oil. These are not the only sources for energy, but yet the GOP gets BILLIONS of dollars in emoluments and direct contributions from both
5083 2018-08-08 15:35:10 Hello friends,
Good news for us, SKYF received letters of intent from several  big oil & gas
companies and agricultural industry, willing to use the SKYF drone services.

A chill oil for hearing
5085 2018-08-08 15:34:54 You didn't leave the democrats, the socialist-democrats left you.
Even Venezuela used their nationalized oil money coming out of the ground and "failed" (their leaders word last week).
5086 2018-08-08 15:34:39 "Cause it's funny" damn the tallest are savages 
5087 2018-08-08 15:34:33 Like an oil tanker coming into dock, it must switch it’s engines off miles out at sea so have time to slow it’s momentum. It’s the same with global environment, if we delay it is making it too late to stop the detrimental momentum. Think scientifically rather than hope & need.:-)
5088 2018-08-08 15:34:29 My taxes bro! We need to build energy east pipeline and cut Saudi oil off. There is no reason to do business with the house of Saud or OPEC countries when we have the oil here. Tell the frogs to smarten up and get that pipeline approved we have some oil to ship.
5089 2018-08-08 15:34:28 Crude oil extending losses, trades down 3.32% for the session, USD 66.77/bbl
5090 2018-08-08 15:34:13 Due to the wholesale costs being intrinsically linked to oil prices that have rocketed over the past 6 months. You expect these companies to run at a loss!

5093 2018-08-08 15:34:03 "Snake oil salesman" is putting it very kindly. #Basta indeed.
5094 2018-08-08 15:33:57 I sure don't. I'm not that worried about global warming because I see a closer crisis: we are running out of oil @PoeBrianL @Cedders68
5095 2018-08-08 15:33:53 Trump is responsible so far for oil price rises, petrol price rises, energy price rises and mortgage price rises. Is he helping the poorest as these changes affect the poorest the most?
5096 2018-08-08 15:33:50 those quarterly reports are enemy of innovation and of particularly something that can alter the course of history.
5097 2018-08-08 15:33:48 He could also be more pro-environment, making oil, gas clean up after themselves & having them pay more royalties

Coal is not sustainable

Gas and oil are not sustainable

How does placing tariffs and giving corporate tax cuts spent on bonuses and stock shares help get jobs again?
5100 2018-08-08 15:33:35 lol I don't think CPG brands are snake oil and it's parents who make the decisions anyway ...but hey kids have been online since the 90s and been alright. It's probably fine.
5101 2018-08-08 15:33:35 Load of rubbish oil is improving wait for a trump tweet

5104 2018-08-08 15:33:30 This hairstylist said I need to come with wash hair with no products in my hair including leave in conditioner & oil...for box braids. Is that normal because....

5108 2018-08-08 15:33:14 Enggak wkwk. Pake sunscreen aja sama bedak. Kadang pake oil kalau lagi kering banget

Susah sih kalau bekas jerawat. Bekas disakitin org aja berbekas 
Tapi aku pake bio oil buat mudarin, cuman laaaaaammaaa banget prosesnya
5109 2018-08-08 15:33:11 China just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  Oil and Automobiles are the main targets! Good Job President Yellow Snow! You are one step closer to pushing us into a huge recession!
5110 2018-08-08 15:33:03 I wonder when Trump will tweet that’s he’s making America better by lowering oil prices...
5111 2018-08-08 15:33:02 Fuel and resource conservation is rational and needed whatever the truth on the warming issue! Climate deniers are like that for emotional reasons and because large amounts of money are being injected into the denial movement by short-sighted oil and mining interests.
5112 2018-08-08 15:32:54 Lots of variables, tbs. But Jif is peanut butter + sugar. Jif reaches my home via massive, highly triggering, “credible” TV ads. Snake oil of the highest caliber.
5113 2018-08-08 15:32:51 US firm finding oil in a country is nothing but a really bad news. Its better we keep importing oil haha

5115 2018-08-08 15:32:43 The funny thing is that he chooses to side with Musk even when Taleb's mortal enemy is Saudi Barbaria (his words) and even when Musk is okay with taking Saudi oil money. Taleb says Musk is a risk-taker but irl, Musk is just a 'tawker.' Confirmation bias can be a dangerous drug.

5124 2018-08-08 15:31:38 The sanghi lot was enjoying burning the midnight oil. The oil price exploitation windfall. And doing the failure moves with eye on politics & serving self.
5125 2018-08-08 15:31:36 Looking for a natural way to get rid of musty odors? Combine 1tsp tea tree oil and 1 C water in a spray bottle and spray the musty area,
5126 2018-08-08 15:31:26 i've heard oil cleansers are best, and if ur having breakouts do a double cleanse(oil cleanser followed by a water based cleanser) like 3 times a week or so
i don't know exact brands tho! also some kind of acid exfoliant can help if u don't have super sensitive skin
5127 2018-08-08 15:31:18 Over the weekend, I rewatched "W." and was definitely reminded of what a mass-murdering idiot he was, but there's also a scene where he speaks Spanish and works an almost-whole day at an oil rig, and I thought, "Well, at least that's SOMETHING."
5128 2018-08-08 15:31:15 We had to go to the fecking IMF for a loan to tie Britain over until the Oil money came through.Industry was on it's arse due to lack of investment.
5129 2018-08-08 15:31:10 The best way for them to destroy Trudeau is to stop their oil shipments to east coast and have all their OPEC partners do the same 
Butts head would explode having to source Canadian oil to eastern Canada instead of Saudi oil!

5132 2018-08-08 15:31:02 Oil changes for low synthetic and regular come get hit
5133 2018-08-08 15:31:01 Worse. Snake oil purveyors everywhere can breathe easy - they're no longer at the bottom of the pile.

5141 2018-08-08 15:30:48 If they pivot away from oil dependency, invest in their people (including the half of their population they keep in metaphorical chains) and stop acting like a spoiled child when they get mildly criticized they will stay and grow in positive directions. I hope so.
5142 2018-08-08 15:30:45 he should go Tehran is beautiful. Trump might slap him with sanctions when he comes back though

5146 2018-08-08 15:30:28 (1) The Earths minerals are already depleted, require coal/oil trucks and other archaic tech and will require more deforestation. All "green" forms of energies require rare toxic minerals. I don't think we can afford to further exacerbate the ecosystems for the "greater good"
5147 2018-08-08 15:30:22 Our pm is a damn joke .  I hope this is a wake up call to get away from the Saudi oil . Also this better be a wake up call to stop supporting Palestine financially when they don't back us here

5150 2018-08-08 15:30:14 @JudgeJeanine I realize that the politics of this nation have become grossly corrupt. tell me how this is affecting big oil and their pricing.
5151 2018-08-08 15:30:13 ...and unsustainable. It's a terrible system. Yes, governments are corrupt and irresponsible with the peoples money, but it's unavoidable no matter what they do. The way the global oil and banking economic system is set up, governments are on an irreversible course to bankruptcy

5153 2018-08-08 15:30:09 In a nutshell, you need to balance the oil. These are some of the products I use:

Green tea face wash (when I have a break out)
Garnier face wash (daily w/spin brush)
Garnier Toner post cleanse, to remove excess dirt 
Radha Beauty Hyaluronic acid serum - key to balancing oil
5154 2018-08-08 15:30:07 Olive oil coconut oil or don’t wash it as much
5155 2018-08-08 15:30:03 I do use CBD oil
5156 2018-08-08 15:29:46 Admirable goal but it is a long timeline.  And Canada doesn't need to import Saudi Oil.
5157 2018-08-08 15:29:45 I guess it will be Canada's turn to retaliate!  Hey @JustinTrudeau WAKE UP!!!  Maybe start by building more pipelines in CANADA and stop RELYING on FOREIGN OIL from places like SAUDI ARABIA!!! WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE buddy!!!
5158 2018-08-08 15:29:43 มันไม่ได้เข้าใจยากขนาดนั้นน
5159 2018-08-08 15:29:42 I need papaya extract, raw shea butter and coconut oil rubbed into my skin rn..
5160 2018-08-08 15:29:40 this is super interesting—my only nitpick is that i wish it contained a critique of nordic countries’ continued dependence on oil exports, which seems incompatible with any ecologically socialist blueprint. though maybe you deal with that elsewhere!
5161 2018-08-08 15:29:27 @realDonaldTrump you gon hop off Saudi Arabias cock & stand behind the country that actually has a sense of morality? Naw yall probably just gonna stay quiet & keep buyin that oil
5162 2018-08-08 15:29:10 By all means keep defending the fracking Queen and Pipeline Party that votes and funds wars for oil and empire and a for-profit healthcare system that kills people every day.

Know what that makes you? Complicit

You condemn Greens for standing up to all of that corruption...#smh
5163 2018-08-08 15:29:09 Wow!! Venezuela has always been socialis, now is just a communist dictatorship. That’s what got that country where it is today. People are barely taxed there, all the money was taken fom the oil industry, which is now bankrupt. Get your facts straight!!
5164 2018-08-08 15:29:07 that's rubbish there have always been secret negotiations. Even sanction time USA were buying oil from Iran

5169 2018-08-08 15:28:45 The North Sea physical oil market is letting off a distress signal - crude is once again being stored on ships – as production increases from major exporters threaten a fragile balance between global supply and demand.
5170 2018-08-08 15:28:40 Coconut oil and water
5171 2018-08-08 15:28:39 oil price way too high
5172 2018-08-08 15:28:28 Most of London and other parts of the UK are owned by oil rich Arabs, so it's obvious why any government would want to offend them.
5173 2018-08-08 15:28:28 still long oil?
5174 2018-08-08 15:28:27 A snake oil salesman who doesn't even bother to give you snake oil. And you will owe him money for not getting your snake oil when he sues you for asking when the snake oil might get delivered. Plus you might get raped.

5189 2018-08-08 15:27:25 Dont you all get it? Trudeau WONT build our pipelines NO MATTER WHAT & certainly wont  lift a finger for CDNs! He pissed off SA so CDNs could experience hardships! He thought maybe hell import oil from Iran? This is ALL calculated. Were heading for economic collapse.
5190 2018-08-08 15:27:20 Maybe so but what about all the oil that was spilled in the Gulf? That wasn’t any Alabamians fault

5196 2018-08-08 15:27:00 If you think 16.000 students out of universities, a small number of patients leaving hospitals and finding an alternative for 9% of oil imports will ruin Canada, it just means you are very receptive to propaganda.
5197 2018-08-08 15:26:57 the last time 'that video' case gone up was to cover a significant increase in oil price.. so now I'm rather worried.
5198 2018-08-08 15:26:49 Q2 revenue at #Argentina's national oil company, @YPFoficial, was up 55% from the same quarter last year, driven by its upstream business, with crude oil production up 3.6%, to 226,300 barrels per day, according to @reorgresearch.

5214 2018-08-08 15:25:15 Yes, love it. I may need the whole castor oil product line. I love her passion and the raw emotion that she shared but not letting the audience have time to get too emotional by sharing her primary focus, “life’s lesson & living your truth.” 
5215 2018-08-08 15:25:15 Yes saw that but saw somewhere China putting tariffs on LNG but not oil but sinopec suggests straight out FU ....
5216 2018-08-08 15:25:12 An essential oil diffuser. So...actually steampunk.  but there's also a fan so...airpunk? 
5217 2018-08-08 15:25:05 I loooooove olive oil! :)
5218 2018-08-08 15:25:03 I need oil change but i do not feel like goin to westside
5219 2018-08-08 15:25:02 “The oil of forgiveness?  When things are marketed that begin to compete directly with what is offered to us through Christ in the Gospel, than what you have is a marketing cult...If you really have an oil forgiveness...why aren’t you giving it away?” @douglaswils

5221 2018-08-08 15:24:57 An oil dependent dictatorship hardly counts as a power. They're nothing without their enablers.
5222 2018-08-08 15:24:55 I don't need to confirm that Musk is a fraudster, charlatan, and snake oil salesman (and also an unjustifiably arrogant bully) because it's obvious. I enjoy looking for the information about how the justice is approaching him to catch him and put him in jail.
5223 2018-08-08 15:24:41 Oil change , pac moves Roadtrip
5224 2018-08-08 15:24:25 Study global oil demand. You can just Google it. Most of the increase will come from China and India, whom are exempt from the Paris accord until 2030, and then can opt out if it’s determined to not be in their best interest.

5226 2018-08-08 15:24:15 The North Sea physical oil market is letting off a distress signal - crude is once again being stored on ships – as production increases from major exporters threaten a fragile balance between global supply and demand.
5227 2018-08-08 15:24:12 #CRUDE OIL - trying to hold the 100 day moving average again. Down sharply after not being able to get above 70.00-70.50 the past few sessions. 67.27 is the 100 day MA. Just underneath it currently. Next support comes in at the 8/2 low of 66.92. 66.29 next support - 7/18's low.
5228 2018-08-08 15:24:04 If I am a snake, then I politely request you stop peddaling my oil.
5229 2018-08-08 15:23:55 manuka honey & mafura oil !
5230 2018-08-08 15:23:54 My understanding Canadian oil is discounted to make up for the extra transportation cost, unlike the USA that has lots of pipe. Saudis were slated to increase their production to bring their prices down. Canada would not like that for it would mean even lower pricing for it's oil
5231 2018-08-08 15:23:44 Exxon Mobil can't approve its 2022 "Coker" to refine oil into low sulphur diesel until 2019. The IMO 2020 rules are in place Jan 1, 2020. The fuel strain put on tanker boats in 2020-2022 is going to increase shipping costs alot, upto 200% in some regions.
5232 2018-08-08 15:23:37 @gmfinancial we bought a 2017 Equinox last year & part of the package was free oil changes & inspections for the life of the car. Called to make a appointment & was told the dealership was bought & new owner is not honoring the free service portion of the sale agreement. Any help
5233 2018-08-08 15:23:33 @JohnGormleyShow you need to talk to the Premier of Quebec about health care for Arabic countries and his connections to those who control the oil flow.
5234 2018-08-08 15:23:31 Not worth army engineer to check oil its time to scrap the whole thing.
5235 2018-08-08 15:23:27 Sounds like a good time to reinvest in coal - right?  There's clearly no future in this.  Coal and Oil.  That's where the future is.
5236 2018-08-08 15:23:18 Sweet. Canadian oil for Canada  now. Lol not gonna hold my breath
5237 2018-08-08 15:23:16 I’m so out of it that I just put an uncracked egg on the pan with oil and walked away waiting for it to cook
5238 2018-08-08 15:23:15 何杯飲んだんだろう………
5239 2018-08-08 15:23:13 How many Western Countries have benefited from the oil in Muslim countries?
5240 2018-08-08 15:23:12 The party of corruption GOP. Greed has deeply stained the GOP. Unregulated capitalism has become the motivation of the extreme wing of the GOP. This open arms to Russia is all about oil money and creating an oligarch class to protect the corruption and exploit natural resources.
5241 2018-08-08 15:23:02 If I remember correctly, China, India, and the EU, plan to purchase some oil from Iran.

5243 2018-08-08 15:22:57 No one will side with Canada because of most countries dependence on Saudi oil.  Politicians in Canada should understand geopolitics!

5245 2018-08-08 15:22:36 Currently the refinery here cannot refine the Alberta oil...that's why it's not being done
5246 2018-08-08 15:22:30 I would absolutely love to win the watermelon CBD oil. I just tried the watermelon E - liquid and it's yummy @jaimeewinehouse
5247 2018-08-08 15:22:28 @DrewFranklinKSR I'm sick of the slander. Sure, you were late ONCE. But @KySportsRadio was late when his car had issues and @ryanlemond had to do the show for the first 20 minutes. And you can't use the car excuse because everyone needs to change their oil.
5248 2018-08-08 15:22:19 looks very good. I  do my own fresh since it's everywhere over her, make it weekly with olive oil, salt, pepper, a bit of good whisky, and garlic.

5256 2018-08-08 15:22:03 They are just moving the students to other locations; most likely USA.  I understand that SA are horrible violators of human rights but there are so many ways to deal with this that don’t involve grandstanding & hurting Canadians. If JT cared about HR stop importing blood oil.
5257 2018-08-08 15:21:54 The explanation is that they’re charlatans who are most happy when the public is buying their snake oil but please #nevervotetory

AND - Buy oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator who arrests other politicians. 
AND - Buy USA oil rather Alberta oil via pipeline earning billions

5263 2018-08-08 15:21:19 Now Trudeau must figure out how to get Eastern pipeline built in a month !  " Ethical Oil" has come home to roost...
5264 2018-08-08 15:21:18 This is about driving Oil Prices up for Trump’s handler Vladimir Putin.

5269 2018-08-08 15:20:57 #Libtards dear liberals if you want to make 15 dollars an hour then get a job in a oil refinery or industrial job like that. You work hard to make money like that, you don’t just get it handed it to you.
5270 2018-08-08 15:20:56 Deff coconut oil! Cake that shit in your hair over night , rinse shampoo and condition next morning  !!!!!!!!!
5271 2018-08-08 15:20:54 Tea tree oil is something magical 
5272 2018-08-08 15:20:52 What’s it going to take for eastern Canada to stop buying Saudi oil? They would rather buy oil from a country that still beheads people rather than from their own country.
5273 2018-08-08 15:20:51 kura sahi ho yesko lagi navaratna oil message garey paxi relief hoinchha!
5274 2018-08-08 15:20:43 The middle east economy pretty much relies on their oil reserves, imagine if renewable energy is way more popular and oil prices crashes to the ground, if you think middle east is in conflict, what do you call this in the future?
5275 2018-08-08 15:20:29 อะเคครับผม
5276 2018-08-08 15:20:21 That was clear before he was elected. Lots of people bought the snake oil
5277 2018-08-08 15:20:08 They why do you allow billions of litres of sewage to be dumped into Canadian waterways every year? 

A pipeline might spill a little oil by accident - you're spilling oceans of pollution intentionally.
5278 2018-08-08 15:20:05 ほんとに真逆なので自分でもドン引きしてます
5279 2018-08-08 15:19:57 Everybody needs middle eastern oil but I agree with you for the most part
5280 2018-08-08 15:19:52 Now we need to stop Big Oil from depressing our economy with these high gas prices. Now that we are drilling and refining, there is no reason for these prices except to depress the economy against President Trump!
5281 2018-08-08 15:19:51 How is everything, even overseas care and schooling, paid for? High taxes or oil revenue or?
Are women allowed to drive, work, vote, have face unveiled, are they considered a person as opposed to a possession, even after marriage? What are the nation's biggest exports? I read

5284 2018-08-08 15:19:32 Will you and Rep Yoho have time for constituents who aren’t connected to the military, the oil and gas industry or religious groups and retirement communities. We’re out here waiting for town halls. Remember those?
5285 2018-08-08 15:19:28 I love y’all, but I hate running other people’s errands. It’s always far as hell from where I started, then they wanna whine and moan, talking bout “but bruh I got gas money”

5296 2018-08-08 15:18:48 I now have @prettystrands leave-in conditioner and oil available for resale at the salon!  Make sure to pick yours up at your next appt!  Thanks Coco!!! I absolutely loooooove both products! @ Hair Care By Amber
5297 2018-08-08 15:18:46 If I find 100 barrels of Oil I can only hope to make 10 barrels of Diesel.
If a refinery cannot afford $90 Oil as its feedstock because it can't sell its finished product for higher prices, its either going to fold, or source cheaper oil. In 2020 many small refiners will fold.
5298 2018-08-08 15:18:45 #UKOG larger pump delivered & so the question is how much MORE of the free flowing oil can we expect on top of the 470 bopd 

Nothing priced in for this at all & so expect the price to react accordingly

5301 2018-08-08 15:18:20 @realDonaldTrump All sanctions, including oil and bank sanctions, should be implemented without any exemptions.

5305 2018-08-08 15:18:02 Hi .@LewisHamilton thks man.

Oil products tended not to be sustainable.

We have a bigger problem with burning it.. CO2 ghg's.. it roasting the planet & causing ocean acidification.

50% of Great Barrier Reef died in 2016!

We need ur voice on this too. Pls.
5306 2018-08-08 15:17:58 The word "chapstick" cld be limiting bcz it's a brand. Many people use "natural" or designer lipbalms. I'd substitute the term "any form of lipbalm or natural oil(s)." Many folks DIY their oil mixes, often bought in the supermarket.
5307 2018-08-08 15:17:56 We can't continue in the ways of Akpabio where we had no cash without creating wealth. Udom is consciously developing the Akwa Ibom of tomorrow not depended on oil revenue transfers from the Federation. This is the Akwa Ibom that generations to come will be proud of.
5308 2018-08-08 15:17:54 Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man, he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.  -Proverbs 21:17-
5309 2018-08-08 15:17:54 Wahan oil nahi milega, yahin marwa le. Unless you like it rough.
5310 2018-08-08 15:17:45 "Snake Oil Salesman" Now this term is a brilliant new addition for the New International Websters Dictionary. Every child 5 years of age and older should be familiar with this term as it defines the slimey side of man's character. "Never become like a cunning snake children."
5311 2018-08-08 15:17:44 Don’t forget the many, many women locked up for trying to live normal lives in #SaudiArabia.

5312 2018-08-08 15:17:42 I don’t have any remedy. But, don’t put oil on your scalp. It clogs the hair follicle and can make it break off

5314 2018-08-08 15:17:37 If a house is engulfed in flames and everyone working to put them out is using old motor oil, maybe they should stop and listen to the ppl standing there telling them they’re insanely dumb.
5315 2018-08-08 15:17:36 Hi Rose, thank you for your honesty, I wish you well. After 5 years of #menopause misery I've discovered cbd oil and (plant) progesterone cream. People have commented on how different I look, possibly even happy at times :) Hope at last.
5316 2018-08-08 15:17:35 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.

5320 2018-08-08 15:17:10 Crude oil is being hammered today. Key daily chart technical levels are coming into play soon. $USO, $UCO & $SCO in play today.
5321 2018-08-08 15:17:06 @GregaHorvatFX Hi - Good call today that oil was going to fall. What are you thinking here now ? CLU8 at 67.25
5322 2018-08-08 15:17:03 The thing is though all they talk about it how tough the oil field is and then call in because they have a rash

5333 2018-08-08 15:15:53 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
5334 2018-08-08 15:15:53 Indeed. missed when it became humiliating to stand up for human rights. Even against big money oil.
5335 2018-08-08 15:15:45 If I have 11 barrels of Oil, You have 10 but need 1 more.
My ability to produce the barrel you need means I get to set the price.
If I have 1 and you have 10, you can play the seller price game longer than I can.
Marginal Barrels are not in storage, they are capacity based.
5336 2018-08-08 15:15:38 Great! Maybe Canadians can now start buying their properties on the cheap, stop importing their oil and buying it from Alberta instead. With them leaving hospitals and schools, more room for others!

This is an opportunity, not a problem.
5337 2018-08-08 15:15:32 K bye. 
We have enough oil. Just need pipelines.
Someday the world will be knocking on our door for a piece of our freshwater.
5338 2018-08-08 15:15:31 Indeed. Trudeau/Soros are cozy with Iran and would love to import their oil instead.

5343 2018-08-08 15:15:25 This Iranian 100 Rials Bank note is special because on its reverse side it shows a fantastically detailed picture of an oil refinery.  I will have to do a bit more research in order to find out more about it.  But for just now it is my thing to be curious about, today.
5344 2018-08-08 15:15:16 Saudi Arabia are going to inherit a big sand pit to play in when there is no need for there oil, or they could use the oil to make prefabricated road surfaces a new type of rubber interlocking long life road meccano set to export.

5350 2018-08-08 15:14:26 Jones makes up lies related to an issue about which we are all concerned, puts them in an extraordinarily unlikely narrative, and then relates them hyperbolicly for purposes of selling snake oil.

5357 2018-08-08 15:13:39 Snake oil salesman is an understatement!!! He pulled off the biggest heist in history! He stole an entire Country with the help of an enemy Country! Now he is going to bleed and gut it for the benefit of himself, his cronies and Russia, and it's only been 19 months!!!
5358 2018-08-08 15:13:20 Venezuela's debt was secured by its oil resources, which revert to the creditors if there's a default. A good portion of the oil receipts are embezzled, and capital flight is rife. Plus, oil prices are down. So the country isn't breaking even, above all on its Capital Account.

5367 2018-08-08 15:13:10 Same performance score is the only metric that should be considered. Did they ask for a raise? Honest question, that may play a part. Could it be that white men have more confidence to ask for higher compensation? The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

5426 2018-08-08 15:08:58 Is Saudi secretly storing oil in terminals to cash in after nov 3 iran sanctions kick in? If Saudi Arabia has started replenishing these, it will gain a certain edge over competitors after the Iran sanctions begin to take their toll on international prices.

5456 2018-08-08 15:05:33 two unnamed sources from OPEC as saying Saudi crude oil production in July fell by 200,000 bpd instead of rising, as per the OPEC+ agreement from June 22. surprising turn of events after Saudi Arabia assured importers that India and the United States it would ramp up production
5457 2018-08-08 15:05:33 I have to get up for an oil change at 10 but i don’t want to leave my bed i hate being an adult
5458 2018-08-08 15:05:23 Thank you very much Patricia. Yes, I usually use rapeseed oil. It has a high smoking point, perfect for cooking curries. It also has a more neutral flavour to that of other vegetable oils. :-)

5466 2018-08-08 15:05:01 Yes. I have cutaways of the original aircraft showing a large oil tank. Otherwise, all the disposable load for the aircraft is in the wings. I wonder if they needed ballast with an empty rear cockpit?
5467 2018-08-08 15:05:00 That's a pretty narrow view of the problem. Musk's tweeting sure doesn't help, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the FUD campaigns spread by shorts, oil interests, and others with a vested interest in Tesla's failure. Going private at least eliminates the shorts.

5476 2018-08-08 15:04:15 If Lewis did that, it would upset all his sponsors. Especially the oil & gas industry sponsors of F1.
5477 2018-08-08 15:04:06 It's not like any of these muslim countries are more than pocket change in our economy. Plus the baggage with their custom and backward sheria laws they adhere to makes it not worth the trouble. They don't drink, they only eat goat and we have our own oil.
5478 2018-08-08 15:04:03 i love u castor oil hehezz

5482 2018-08-08 15:03:04 @RadhamohanBJP @ChouhanShivraj India's problem is they create huge sulprus of some food items which no godowns can accomodate n also very low export chances. on the other hand it imports huge amt of vegetable oil. encourage oilseeds production by proper incentives.

5486 2018-08-08 15:02:47 I’m ready for fall mostly bc I’m tired of this humidity and my face feeling greasy all the time no matter how much I wash it and how much anti oil shit I use
5487 2018-08-08 15:02:46 "Sin'dorei" decided it wanted to heat up and go through gel phase, i assume thanks to the fragrance oil, so i threw it in my slab mold to insulate it and i hope its enough to help the gel not look awful, otherwise tomorrow im fucking baking soap LOL
5488 2018-08-08 15:02:46 I don't smoke pot but I do use CBD oil.
5489 2018-08-08 15:02:30 For me it’s that big oil drum boss
5490 2018-08-08 15:02:19 I don't see it like that. The US produces too much condensate. The market doesn't want condensate they want oil that produces distillates. China will look to Iran and Russia and this will end up as America's loss.
5491 2018-08-08 15:02:07 No, thanks, I've got some hemp oil going. It's just a process.
5492 2018-08-08 15:02:02   if I break your heart na oil spillage,,,I study this your love freedom college,,,nne you too sweetii likeii yam portage   MAD JAM....
5493 2018-08-08 15:02:02 They are all free to go spew their vile insanity on Gab. Alex Jones is also free to peddle his snake oil products there too.
5494 2018-08-08 15:02:02 Agreed  So many products to try. I have palettes, setting powder and your baking oil which I looooovved at first try.
5495 2018-08-08 15:01:51 Mercola is a snake oil salesman con artist.  I have to assume you are one too, now.
5496 2018-08-08 15:01:45 Have you tried cbd oil? Works wonders for mine. Only thing I have found to help.
5497 2018-08-08 15:01:40 No I know what you mean!  My body can't tolerate a lot of fat/oil either
5498 2018-08-08 15:01:37 yup, the men are happy sure, rule over women with iron fists... talk back and be stoned to death, great place. Oil strangle hold is dying and you will be left with nothing...the nation is dying. Good luck on your own. haz
5499 2018-08-08 15:01:22 We're made to believe that somehow the #IranDeal was never a good one. But let's keep in mind that US has become a major oil producer, enough reasons to stop the flow of Iranian oil to create a market for ours even if that means further jeopardizing regional peace & spewing junk.
5500 2018-08-08 15:01:03 both DNC and GOP governments have been VERY cozy to them. Kinda like they were very cozy to Saddam/Iraq until they decided to throw him down the drain. Saudi princes should be very careful. It's not them that the US gov loves, it's the oil beneath their feet. God $$$ trumps all.

AND you still buy Oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator who arrests opposing politicians.
Say it out loud Eastern Canada is afraid to talk about Energy east pipeline

5505 2018-08-08 15:00:29 How has anyone benefittedd from ending cap &trade? Did oil prices or food costs decline?.

Again, the only beneficiaries have been those on Bay Are No bankrolled Ford election.
5506 2018-08-08 15:00:24 Yep and Ohio still hasn’t had enough of the Snake Oil salesman.

5512 2018-08-08 14:59:49 Good plan! I support EE the only problem is it will take years to complete and eastern Canada is gonna need oil now.
Trudeau now has to go hat in hand to Trump.
IMO this is about Iran sanctions and Trudeau's soft position on Iran not a tweet.  Trump just boxed the moron in.
5513 2018-08-08 14:59:47 Much much respect to Sakarai and his team. He looked dead during the direct. My man's gotta be burning the midnight oil non-stop
5514 2018-08-08 14:59:39 I'm curious how effective solar panels would be during WINTER?
Like, seriously curious. Would the snowcover not make them utterly useless? 
(not to mention the oil needed to fabricate said panels)
5515 2018-08-08 14:59:27 Somehow getting an oil change at 9:30 am on a Wednesday takes more than an hour and a half at this place.
5516 2018-08-08 14:59:26 Glad for 1ce #Canada had the balls to say it like it is. Even tho 15 of 19 terrorists were frm ksa, they did have to go thru what Iraqis, afganis had to. All becoz they have oil & shitloads of $ they are treated like royalty. $ will soon run out if the world adopts #greenenergy
5517 2018-08-08 14:59:23 Because the oil concessions and asbestos exports aren’t nearly enough for installing Trump...  Putin needs more.
5518 2018-08-08 14:59:22 Calling Trump a ‘snake oil salesman’ is way too kind.
5519 2018-08-08 14:59:22 oil money and plastic fans is all you got bro

5522 2018-08-08 14:58:59 OIl down good for spending...

But AMZN making up the loss :)
5523 2018-08-08 14:58:49 Would your prefer to see other countries importing Saudi oil? Sure sounds like it.
5524 2018-08-08 14:58:39 Trump’s father was snake oil salesman as well and so it goes...So is #DonaldTrumpJr is one too along with his sister #IvankaTrump another big scammer.
5525 2018-08-08 14:58:28 Big Oil company. Either get rid of the competition of the future or use it as revenue and control both options
5526 2018-08-08 14:58:27 Something tells me Trump's never getting Salesman of the Month, and chances are that snake oil is being made in China & now costs more because of Trump's tariffs.

5530 2018-08-08 14:58:09  We were slandered left right and centre with the usual “ruining football”, “oil money” jibes for weeks mate. Ederson won two league titles with Benfica so he wasn’t unproven, and has also proved to be worth every penny of what we paid for him.
5531 2018-08-08 14:58:08 YES. THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET READ THE ISLAMIC WAR MANUAL THEY CALL THE QUR'AN. OIL MONEY JUST WHISPERS IN THEIR EARS THAT ISLAM IS PEACE! WHICH IT MEANS TO SUBMIT! LOL HOW DOES 1 GET ANOTHER TO SUBMIT IF HE/SHE REFUSES? HENCE THE FRONT PAGE!
5532 2018-08-08 14:58:07 Agree, It's a blindspot of being USA the exceptionality liberal monopolies ban tactics & not understanding the danger of it in the long term. Alex Jones grifter tactics is deceiving & shady - same time you also have the choice not to buy into the batshit snakeskin oil production
5533 2018-08-08 14:58:03 If it wasn’t for this inept trudeau gov’t we would be energy self sufficient, as well as shipping our oil somewhere other than the US at 1/2 price. All Canada’s woes ride on this gov’t.

5549 2018-08-08 14:56:56 Does it taste the same? I always thought that the good taste came from frying it? (first time in ox or beef fat and the second time in regular frying oil?)
5550 2018-08-08 14:56:53 I've not seen that information but what I have seen is the independence movement in the western isles is more or less the same as it is in Orkney and Shetland.

5566 2018-08-08 14:55:28 Calling Trump a snake oil salesman is an insult to snake oil salesmen. 
5567 2018-08-08 14:55:14 The most humiliating and painful thing for Trump voters to admit is that HE is the snake oil, and THEY bought GALLONS of it!
5568 2018-08-08 14:54:57 Oil money seeps into every crevice of democracy. Like communism, it gets in. Maybe Democrats should stop holding the door open. The welcome Matt has worn itself out.

5603 2018-08-08 14:52:43 Sure, of course the users of that oil won’t mind paying for the pipelines, it could added to the monthly bill, we’ll call it a pipeline tax, who could object ?
5604 2018-08-08 14:52:41 sometimes i wonder why i’m so petty/where i get it from, then i remember that my papaw drove to key west, florida in the 70’s just bc president jimmy carter said to stay home bc of the oil shortage

5610 2018-08-08 14:52:24 …Russia cannot feed itself with no import, but Putin voluntarily almost forbids all import food (only few and very exotic states on planet are deliver fruits in Russia-for example Uruguay-it's South America), very serious shortages of milk resulted in total fake palm oil cheese.

5612 2018-08-08 14:52:19 That makes Zero sense - They are Big Oil, Tesla is 100% electric... Yes they already invested in Tesla but that is to make money on an investment just like any other stock ot bond.
5613 2018-08-08 14:52:14 .@andrewcuomo is abusing NY regulatory power to destroy the @NRA. Why stop there?

Want to do business in Texas, banks? You can't work with Planned Parenthood anywhere.

Want to pump oil in Louisiana, @Shell? You can't sell any of it in New York.

Fun!

5614 2018-08-08 14:52:07 I wish it was only snake oil. This feels like snake venom.
5615 2018-08-08 14:52:06 Yes argan oil should work great!
5616 2018-08-08 14:52:02 okay thank you! I had used vitamin e oil last night to help spread it easier but it just clumped together but I’ll try it out 
5617 2018-08-08 14:51:59 Value of Canada M&A Deals Slumps Amid Oil Rally
5618 2018-08-08 14:51:54 The EIA pressured to keep oil prices down.  I don’t trust Trump and his minions.
5619 2018-08-08 14:51:53 Don't worry, you'll always be the #1 snake oil salesman, that'll never be taken from you.

Btw it's cheque.

5626 2018-08-08 14:51:38 Can you see my position why would I trust anyone that acts like socialist libs same talking point attacks giddy at reporting and silencing me for a week?
5627 2018-08-08 14:51:32 Bio oil
5628 2018-08-08 14:51:28 Coincidently while I was living dt I had bought this oil from this company, not even knowing what it could do, all I knew was I can’t breath I can’t smoke I wanna get high , so I started taking this oil only from this company like 2 days after I started tiny dosages
5629 2018-08-08 14:51:28 If it’s very sluggish then it might need a gearbox oil change or at least a good reset.
5630 2018-08-08 14:51:23 More like a bigger rube muscling in on a smaller rube because they want to be at the front of the line to buy Trump's magical snake oil.
5631 2018-08-08 14:51:13 Canada oil consumption in 2017 = 886,220,000 barrels. Imports from Saudi Arabia in 2017 = 27,375,000 barrels. KSA oil is 3% of Canadian oil needs.
5632 2018-08-08 14:51:06 Dead tired. But I haven't felt so alive in such a long time. 

I walked under the rain. I ruined my shoes from the mud. We went to a Yolanda community. We looked at a recovering site from an oil spill. We talked to IPs, 4Ps beneficiaries. 

I feel so 'me'. This is who I am.

5635 2018-08-08 14:50:57 PSA you only need 1-2 tablespoons of oil to cook. stop deep frying everything 
5636 2018-08-08 14:50:55 And not even a good snake oil salesman.  His customers are just idiots.
5637 2018-08-08 14:50:55 this is offensive to snail oil salesmen.
5638 2018-08-08 14:50:39 Trump is a salesman. What are you’re needs and wants? If it’s legal he’ll get it for you. Puten needs cash and Trump is rolling in it. Play nice (like get out of Crimea) and I’ll loan you some. You can pay us back with oil. Always hire an MBA for the Oval Office. @seanhannity
5639 2018-08-08 14:50:38 Why would we use oil powered cars..... that goes against everything Tesla stands for... Their country operates off of oil, a company like Tesla is a massive threat to them. It's easier to buy then and kill them than to try to outdo them.
5640 2018-08-08 14:50:36 And as a Saudi , I know thousands of Canadian working in Saudi are depending on what you called “the dirty oil” to feed their families . Am I right ?
5641 2018-08-08 14:50:33 Lot more wealthier thanks to oil
5642 2018-08-08 14:50:21 Strong. MCT oil, grass-fed butter and heavy cream. Bulletproof, baby!
5643 2018-08-08 14:50:13 Could signal a very weak, fearful, and incompetent Prince. Could have interesting implications for oil if Saudi Arabi is going off the rails.

5645 2018-08-08 14:50:10 You say "not attending" and make it sound like just not turning up. Some negotiation first helps oil the wheels. The jury system is not necessarily a "poor system" - indeed it has a deal going for it - but I think you'd be a bad juror ~
5646 2018-08-08 14:50:10 Yup, but sadly many R’s are ardent consumers of the snake oil #DonTheCon is peddling.
5647 2018-08-08 14:50:04 Hey, hey now.  Don't insult snake oil salesmen.
5648 2018-08-08 14:50:00 liverpool: champions league money

5649 2018-08-08 14:49:59 What happened to you was all I asked and was attacked. Asking questions being told he blocked them isn't an answer I blocked them for their actions they said he's British as if that matters I support conservatives around the world many Canada friends anti trudo
5650 2018-08-08 14:49:58 #SaudiBudget: @MOF_KSA: Q2 non-#oil #revenues reached SR89.423 billion, an increase of 42% year-on-year.
5651 2018-08-08 14:49:58 Of course, because the U.S. is the puppet to the big oil barons.  The U.S. only imposes sanctions if the cause affects them financially and won't affect their bottom line.
5652 2018-08-08 14:49:56 いいからCome on a Tea party聴いてくれ
5653 2018-08-08 14:49:54 Oil is a fungible commodity.  Someone else will buy oil and it will go there.  Another (or same the entity) will sell to China.  Same with Soybeans.  China won't spite itself.  This is primarily a PR war on their side.  We sell mostly commodities.  They sell finished product.
5654 2018-08-08 14:49:40 @TheDailyTurbo Hoe staan de paaltjes bij WTI oil ?
5655 2018-08-08 14:49:26 But but Harper...JT sold them LAVs that are killing civilians. 
Why do we have a wheat board?
How much oil is 10%, both quantity and cost? If Energy East had gone ahead we would import 0%.
5656 2018-08-08 14:49:23 It's pretty clear the snake oil has been passed around the Conservative party....   Chris Collins just another corrupt piece of shit....   Take them all down..

5659 2018-08-08 14:49:10 $/CL oil futures never gave the dauly buy signal.  Now giving a reverse candle at important moving average n ppo daily sell signal.
5660 2018-08-08 14:49:10 I JUST LOVE SITTING AT @Honda FOR ALMOST 3 HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGEEEEEEEE
5661 2018-08-08 14:49:09 vitamin e oil too!! every night before bed and just wear some clothes you don't care for in case it stained it but it's never happened to me before 
5662 2018-08-08 14:48:59 .....not to mention the Canada's Oil is now selling at 40% discount. That NDP social license is really helping us.....sad
5663 2018-08-08 14:48:58 Why not run oil and solar powered cars? Think big.
5664 2018-08-08 14:48:43 How much do US taxpayers fork over to that government each year?  Israel is not a national security interest of the US and neither is control of the oil fields.
5665 2018-08-08 14:48:42 it was chicken thigh & ground beef mixed with sesame oil, minced broccoli, carrot, oats and cooked rice, baked, layered, and frosted with buttery mashed potato. it smelled so good and so awful at the same time?? but he ate his slice so fast oh man
5666 2018-08-08 14:48:40 Cons of working for an oil & gas company:
 Have to park my shitty Kia round the corner to avoid embarrassment in the Audi filled car park 
5667 2018-08-08 14:48:27 With the Crude Oil Inventory report coming out higher than expected and the $DXY rising, we should continue seeing the $CAD loose value thus going long on the $USDCAD is just the right pair to be trading these days #forexsignals #forextrading #usdcad

Yes, thats the general critque on communist ideas - where does the money come from?

Venezuela has some of the richest oil deposits in the Americas and still a failing socialist economy.  Not implemented correctly??

5675 2018-08-08 14:47:44 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub
5676 2018-08-08 14:47:39 Iran's oil money has been spent on war in Islam (The war for the issuance of Islamic terrorism)

Do you love Islamic terrorists?

5677 2018-08-08 14:47:36 We have also found huge oil reserves very recently. That will give us hundreds of billions of dollars. Someone should tell this to PTI govt.
5678 2018-08-08 14:47:35 You have tonsils for a reason. When your car tells you it needs gas or an oil change, cutting the wire doesn't resolve the problem. Your body is telling you something you're doing is wrong... Change your diet and lifestyle and you'll be good.
5679 2018-08-08 14:47:34 One time a guy found out I used coconut oil and told me to “stop using black people products” ????? COCONUT OIL IS NATURES GIFT TO EVERYONE.

5682 2018-08-08 14:47:18 I haven't seen anyone ask Ocasio-Cortez about a basic principle of socialism: government control of industry. I wonder what industries she'd like to eventually nationalize: oil, steel, pharmaceuticals, doctors, etc.
5683 2018-08-08 14:47:02 @kenjilopezalt for your crispy tofu and broc recipe, why do you do the initial frying with veg or peanut oil? why not sesame for the flavor?
5684 2018-08-08 14:47:02 step terakhir karena face oil itu bisa meresap ke moist tapi moist gabisa meresap ke face oil
5685 2018-08-08 14:46:51 idk if you’re going new or used but i got my car brand new so no problems but everybody ik that’s gotten a used hasn’t had any problems either. plus they cover your oil changes/inspections for the 1st 2 years
5686 2018-08-08 14:46:47 You labeled Paul Ryan the 'flimflam man' as soon as he put together fantasy budgets (that were eventually adopted) and somehow the press created this aura that Ryan was the 'intellectual center of the party' which is like anointing a snake oil salesman as POTUS. Hey!! We did that
5687 2018-08-08 14:46:46 I don’t remember seeing video of China driving Fords and Chevys.  And we don’t sell oil to China.
5688 2018-08-08 14:46:42 I appreciate that warning I am a free thinker I can always mute anyone but I dont just block anyone because someone tells me to. I process info i was taught to think not what to think can you understand this? Their tactics made them turn me into more of a connor supporter Q

5693 2018-08-08 14:46:24 Not sure how much I believe in this. But the other thing they could do is to end Tesla so oil lives longer.

5695 2018-08-08 14:46:01 The figure is from a study, heard in a lecture by Wallach from "Dead doctors don't lie". Worth listening though as always with a critical approach. Not all that he says is totally correct. MDs=dumb and overexposed to their Snake Oil Industrial Complex.
5696 2018-08-08 14:45:51 Canada buys oil from Saudi?! they're a net exporter (major ones especially to the US as I recall)
5697 2018-08-08 14:45:44 Eggs and toast for breakfast doesn’t mean the eggs are in the toast. They are seperate and don’t really have anything to do with one another. It could be eggs and motor oil if your stomach can deal with it
5698 2018-08-08 14:45:40 Only Now it's impossible… send in the oil wars.
5699 2018-08-08 14:45:37 Congress is for illegal immigration.  Ag, oil and construction insist on this cheap labor. Rs & Ds are aren’t going against their donors.

It’s why nothing is done about illegal immigration.  Trump has asked them to address it, even reversed DACA.  Still nothing out of Congress
5700 2018-08-08 14:45:31 I have two relatives who voted third party in 2016. I remind them that they chose to drill for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. Sooo green.
5701 2018-08-08 14:45:30 n UN Security Council, briefing on Iraq @UNIraq, @PeruEnLaONU supports Iraq's national strategy for poverty reduction, based in part on a more equitable distribution of oil revenues.  Water scarcity in some regions a potential trigger of new conflict, extremism.

5708 2018-08-08 14:44:33 Iran has been labelled a pariah state since America deposed the Shah when he nationalised the Iranian oil industry. It’s all about the US$ and America wanting to control every country, not forgetting the illegal invasion of Grenada.
5709 2018-08-08 14:44:21 If the Saudi's help make Tesla go private does that mean they have the ability to influence the path of the company or just an investment? Lowkey wouldn't doubt them trying to run the company into the dust... their country runs on oil...
5710 2018-08-08 14:44:00 Awk guna cleansing oil jenama ape?
5711 2018-08-08 14:43:59 Watch the US back Saudi Arabia again, just to ensure the oil payments being made in the dollar. The debt based Petro dollar is the reason for practically most of out problems, at least most of the wars we've seen
5712 2018-08-08 14:43:57 It’s always been weird to me when people want candidates they agree with across the board. 

I don’t even get how parties come up with uniform platforms on wildly different issues. If you and I agree on health care why would that mean we agree on oil drilling or whatever?
5713 2018-08-08 14:43:49 Coconut oil na lang virgin ngayon HAHAHAHAHA
5714 2018-08-08 14:43:46 Does it surprise you that the U.S. would not back Canada. First,Saudi has a lot of control with respect to oil and secondly the U.S. are still one State short of in acting Constitutional protection for Equal Rights in their own Constitution....after 40 years.
Not surprised!
5715 2018-08-08 14:43:43 @realDonaldTrump The new EPA chief is a former coal industry lobbyist who is a climate change denier. He is great at protecting oil industry profits but terrible at protecting the environment.  People in CO & CA are suffocating from the heat and the ash-filled smoke.  RESIGN!

5717 2018-08-08 14:43:29 And Que nixed the pipeline. They will pay the price for their stupidity. Canada East needs to be built and soon. Wake up Trudeau. If you are going to piss off our oil suppliers, make sure we have our own supply.
5718 2018-08-08 14:43:25 Where's buck-a-litre gas? I challenge oil companies to drop their prices and help average Canadians make ends meet. For those companies who participate I'll consider giving their Facebook pages a like. #BuckABeer

5724 2018-08-08 14:43:09 I don’t want foreign individuals, companies, governments or organizations interfering in Canada’s domestic affairs/laws. I therefore do not support interfering in domestic affairs/laws of other sovereign nations. That being said, we should be using oil, creating jobs

5737 2018-08-08 14:42:15 Pulling out of the JCPOA was done for the sole purpose of imposing sanctions on Iran, in hope of regime change to a pro-US regime. It’s not about nuclear weapons but oil, gas, and petrodollars.
5738 2018-08-08 14:42:10 Over the last few weeks, #oil goes down on trade war fears (politics) but goes up on fundamental data

5740 2018-08-08 14:42:03 My other half is in the oil business. The left refuses to admit that clean energy is anything but clean.

5871 2018-08-08 14:32:25 If we really wanted to think strategically about oil, for example, we’d reserve it for importnat future needs such as medical tools and supplies. Plastics are so much more important for things other than food.

5988 2018-08-08 14:24:36 But, North America in particular does not need their oil or anything else from them, and we never have.

5999 2018-08-08 14:23:43 Exactly. It’s nice to stay close to home but that’s rarely possible. Welding, oil rigging, pipe lining, etc. you gotta follow the money.

6011 2018-08-08 14:22:24 Seeing what Dubai,Saudi and Qatar are doing with their Oil money is making me wonder whether it is coconut oil we are selling...
6012 2018-08-08 14:22:22 I feel like those are oil and water.
6013 2018-08-08 14:22:19 Some ideas for the oil money. Interest free loan to attend UG for teachers and 50% reduction in the registration fee.
6014 2018-08-08 14:22:15 I'm genuinely curious as to what Russia has to offer the US economy that we cannot get from any other country. Technology? Oil? Exactly what is so special about Russia that all the GOP wants to deal with them?
6015 2018-08-08 14:22:00 Yeah that oil change reply killed this convo. WTF
6016 2018-08-08 14:21:52 Try scrubbing them ka lejwe, coconut oil and/lemon.
6017 2018-08-08 14:21:44 $CL down apparently because of the Chinese sanctions, it's wired because the Chinese had already decreased their oil imports from the US #OOTT
6018 2018-08-08 14:21:43 A small family business will do the right things, they have to because they are small and will go out of business. But big corporate business, exploit people and Earth. Look no further than WalMart, Big Banks, Amazon, Apple, Nike and big oil.

6027 2018-08-08 14:20:40 Since TE Lawrence of Arabia handed over the Peninsula to Rockefeller's Standard Oil (now @Saudi_Aramco), the medieval unelected Saudi junta has been only the titular owner of @NATO's oil reserves in the Peninsula

6031 2018-08-08 14:20:18 He said he would lower drug prices. He didn’t. He has opened up mining and oil companies into national forests. He has not built the wall with Mexican money- he insists we pay for it. He approved gutting important part of health care act instead of improving it.
6032 2018-08-08 14:20:12 Southern Hemisphere Oils have arrived at the Venice Olive Oil Co.!

6033 2018-08-08 14:20:10 I once stained an unfinished coffee table with espresso because I thought it would be "appropriate," and it turned out beautiful. I finished it with vegetable oil and butcher's paste wax. Was my favorite piece of furniture ever.
6034 2018-08-08 14:20:09 The notion that “god has a plan” is absurd. But hey everyone has to buy into some sort of snake oil.
6035 2018-08-08 14:19:39 Did you know that some states, like California, enforce a oil recycling program? That's sustainability we can get behind! Does your state recycle their oil?

6049 2018-08-08 14:17:54 Which other countries?! Iran!! You can’t buy it from Iran,Russia or the GCC countries,And your solution is not that good honestly because what you have is the dirty oil,it is not good for you guys,In my opinion the solution is to apologize,I mean your government not the Canadians

6062 2018-08-08 14:16:44 They have already been a net importer of oil on three occasions, they want to attack Qatar to start a proxy war with Iran and they are further entrenching essentially feudal/tribal traditions... It's going to be a shit show.

6065 2018-08-08 14:16:31 Rupee strengthened marginally against the US Dollar today. The appreciation was largely balanced out by the Dollar demand from oil importers and Dollar sales by exporters and foreign banks. However, strengthening of Dollar and weakness of Yuan weighed on the currency.

6072 2018-08-08 14:16:14 I think new investors jumped in with the SCC news today with all the ramping on #ANGS but will leave the boat soon as the SP current rise is unsustainable without real oil flow, specially after the Lidsey oil flow lies. FYI, they produced only 2 barrels in April 2018!

6086 2018-08-08 14:14:58 When your economy partly relies on the oil you import and the weapons you sell you keep quiet for as long as you can e.g. no critique of Islam

When your economy doesn’t rely on those things you ignore the persecution e.g. Sikhs etc etc.

It boils down to a question of maths
6087 2018-08-08 14:14:47 No, the dispute with Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with the #TMX and selling oil to Asia. 
Nor will building the pipeline, so we can export tremendous volumes through Metro Vancouver by putting that oil on the ocean will impact one bit, the sale of oil between SA and China.
6088 2018-08-08 14:14:38 Interesting/odd theory given to me by a friend: "The Liberal Govt started this feud with Saudi in order to help justify further support of Canadian Oil & Gas industry without losing 'eco cred' I'm sceptical that much thought was put into it.
6089 2018-08-08 14:14:29 I am wondering who will win the bet AND just how far they will go for the win.
6090 2018-08-08 14:14:27 Why are any of these equities getting sold off this hard when Q3 is expected to show a higher oil prices than in Q2. Speculation and fear imo. Someone who can see past the noise and understands the long term fundamentals would understand that this is where you want to be a buyer.
6091 2018-08-08 14:14:25 And move to what exactly?  Virtually all our transportation runs on oil. Be prepared to live a very local life.
6092 2018-08-08 14:14:20 !!! #Oil more expensive than #biomass in €/GJ.Current #WTI is $68.12/ barrel or €58.82. And 1 toe =7.4 barrels of oil,and 1 #toe =41.87 GJ, thus 41.87/7.4= 5.66 GJ per #barrel of oil & WTI oil is $68.12 /5,66 GJ = €58.82 /5.66 GJ = €10.40 per #GJ,and #pellets is €8.76/GJ /GJ

6102 2018-08-08 14:12:57 Danny, I have been taking Carlson's fish oil for years.  What are your thoughts on their product?
6103 2018-08-08 14:12:55 clarification on #petcoke and #needlecoke -
1. Petcoke is simply synthetic coal. It is end product of crude oil refinery and used as coal or fuel.This product costs rs 17/20 per kg.

6105 2018-08-08 14:12:45 Just like every other Canadian with any brains, I fully back out government's response to human rights abuses.  Saudi's can keep their oil and money, we have lots of both.  Not importing their oil, means we have a larger market for our own.  The Saudis can go pound sand.
6106 2018-08-08 14:12:36 I now prefer the smell of efficascent oil and white flower compared to that oh-so-burgis perfume.

6112 2018-08-08 14:12:15 Always wondered whenever I’m due for an oil change, why are my mileage up quicker than the average? 5K miles in two months? Then, I’ve come to the realization, after every oil change, I’ve taken road trips right after; Canada, northern NH, NYC...etc.

6114 2018-08-08 14:12:09 They have good news all the time, and the share price ignores it. I think the market's mood may be shifting back to optimism from extreme pessimism on weed stocks. I have a CBD Oil stock $CVSI that is a freakin' juggernaut right now. But we'll see. #cannabis.
6115 2018-08-08 14:12:09 Here are a few tips to identifying Vandals.
1. They are hesitant to identify themselves when asked.
2. Often travel in cars or bikes that are NOT branded. Look out for Jerry cans that actually carry the Oil away.

6116 2018-08-08 14:12:00 America was great when, in the face of 9/11, instead of sending thoughts and prayers, we instead said, “Fuck you gimme oil.”

The gimme oil thing is more of a tradition than anything. Why do you think it took us so long to invade Germany during WWII?
6117 2018-08-08 14:11:50 Exactly. I think it was the Saudi oil minister that said- The Stone Age didn’t end for lack of rocks. The Saudis May be superfluous in the oil biz in the next 50 years but they have extensive holdings in many companies

6125 2018-08-08 14:11:02 That’s so weird. This is praise. They are hardly slogging it like they are away on an oil rig. No one one would ever see accolades as detrimental.
6126 2018-08-08 14:11:00 Must be great to land a job with a department Grayling is running. Must be like striking oil in your back garden.
6127 2018-08-08 14:10:59 Nasdaq breadth positive today, NQ holding up better as AAPL bounces. This limits ES downside, which tested within 1 tick the true VA gap at 2853.25. Crude oil down ahead of EIA.
6128 2018-08-08 14:10:56 its getting our oil to where its its needed by canadian  refineries & consumers thats the issue

6130 2018-08-08 14:10:53 Revelation's of oil and oil's of Revelation
6131 2018-08-08 14:10:47 Yes, preciously because everyone in government secretly knows that the we are running out of oil.
6132 2018-08-08 14:10:47 I haven't travelled that route since. The heat on those trains made me fall asleep. Did you know that route nearly closed in the 80s? Enter "Summit Tunnel Oil Train Fire" on Google to find out.
6133 2018-08-08 14:10:41 Overheard at car dealer while waiting out my oil change:
“Yes, we can shuttle you over there. We just can’t pick you up and bring you back.”
What’s the point of having a courtesy shuttle if it only goes one way?
6134 2018-08-08 14:10:35 This morning as my sons prepared for their first day of school, I silently enjoyed a healthy breakfast.  During my innocent meal, I discovered with shock that one of them had added fish oil capsules to our healthy bag of cashews; Bless them.
6135 2018-08-08 14:10:35 Numbers 7:61 His offering was one silver charger, the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering: #GodBlessYou

6138 2018-08-08 14:10:31 Don't worry, it's not as if we buy oil or anything important
6139 2018-08-08 14:10:27 But normally we think you oil rich.

6143 2018-08-08 14:10:13 Going long is so wrong
6144 2018-08-08 14:09:51 lmao we have our own oil and can use it instead of shipping all abroad and using SA oil
6145 2018-08-08 14:09:28 I literally asked the car guys where I went for an oil change and the front door to the place was literally right next to me 
6146 2018-08-08 14:09:13 Ive done good keeping our costs low, but I live in fear of heating oil. Gas I just drive less, electricity I lowered by 50 bucks, Taxes, take all the reductions, but heating oil no way around that
6147 2018-08-08 14:09:09 World: Data is the new oil.

6149 2018-08-08 14:08:56 John Jay. Quit using “big oil” products if you believe they’re so evil.
6150 2018-08-08 14:08:53 HA! I adore John Wayne. But in terms of art, he belongs on screen, not some cheesemaker's oil on canvas. (And he himself collected Asian woodblock prints.) One of my grandparents probably did have a John Wayne portrait somewhere...
6151 2018-08-08 14:08:37 97% of our oil reserves are in the oil sands, you don't use drilling rigs for that.
6152 2018-08-08 14:08:29 @realDonaldTrump please stop screwing with the two shares I have in oil stocks.
6153 2018-08-08 14:08:22 I gotta get a oil change and get me sum breakfast..... plus I gotta roll up then meet sum folks Cross T on  Superior
6154 2018-08-08 14:08:09 Wanted to tell her that her wig looking a lil dry and needs some oil but you worried about me  but then I might not have a job 
6155 2018-08-08 14:08:07 Follow the money? Desperate attempt to end the dependency of #oil?
6156 2018-08-08 14:07:59 It's because they know the only place olives belong are in oil.
6157 2018-08-08 14:07:56 Don’t worry, without NAFTA Canada can assist in raising the price of gas, natural gas and oil!
6158 2018-08-08 14:07:47 Alaska’s graceful beauty is being challenged by oil, gas and mining interests led by Donald Trump.
6159 2018-08-08 14:07:42 i came to get an oil change & they’re talking about full & semi synthetic oil & idk man JUST CHANGE MY OIL
6160 2018-08-08 14:07:33 Kailangan ko ng madaming stress away oil.
6161 2018-08-08 14:07:26 to bestow on them a crown of beauty
    instead of ashes,
the oil of joy
    instead of mourning,
and a garment of praise
    instead of a spirit of despair.
They will be called oaks of righteousness,
    a planting of the Lord
    for the display of his splendor.

6163 2018-08-08 14:07:19 You really should educate yourself on remediated land and on the extraction processes in the Oilsands. Remediation isn’t an exact science but oil companies spend millions on the process yearly. There have been great successes and it is a learning curve.
6164 2018-08-08 14:07:02 Dykem. doesn't get better than that! Shellac, or hide glue brought to heat. way oil as well. nitro solvent...but more specifically, that yellow cloth used after every hunt to finish wiping off the cleaner from the firearm. freshly spent brass. dirt...wet, loamy earth
6165 2018-08-08 14:07:02 I spent a number of years working in the oil patch, I know what's going on in your picture !

6168 2018-08-08 14:06:50 "supports sustainable palm oil"

like normally that's great but all the same i'd rather buy cheese that's agnostic on the subject

6172 2018-08-08 14:06:27 A mi me encanta la Waso de Shiseido (color smart day moisturizer oil free). También tengo la piel tirando a grasa y queda mate, el color se funde súper bien con el tono natural, parece que vas a cara lavada y tiene SPF 30.
6173 2018-08-08 14:06:09 Worried about why my hair looking dry and did I put some oil in it  girlllllllllllahhh

6176 2018-08-08 14:05:53 Don't laugh: Pak reports that  #Pakistan discovers more oil than #Kuwait & Pakistanis have over $ 600 billion hiddeen overseas. The day our country gets off the high horse of delusions & dreams of grandeur &comes down to reality & rationality Pak will begin to make some progress.
6177 2018-08-08 14:05:43 Hemp oil makes petro based plastic. Grown in a couple months. Completely renewable. Plant based. Biodegradable. Why are we always trying to reinvent the wheel.
6178 2018-08-08 14:05:40 CORRECTED-CHINA GOVT SAYS COAL, DIESEL ARE AMONG PRODUCTS AFFECTED (REMOVES CRUDE OIL)
6179 2018-08-08 14:05:27 The larger questions of Iran are not related to this, agreed. The power of GCC, KSA further cementing control & its oil is related to this as sanctions hit Iran. I am not arguing that Saudi's are right on the two women, that is unrelated to this exercise in power, like Iran
6180 2018-08-08 14:05:27 eu ia falar isso, hehehe

mas teve o efeito peso pesado de ontem, que foi contra o oil ... ;)
6181 2018-08-08 14:05:25 Just curious... If you've used CBD oil, what's been your experience?
6182 2018-08-08 14:05:24 Try coconut oil. Or look into some kiehls products. What's nice about them is they provide free samples that will let you test products before buying.
6183 2018-08-08 14:05:13 I made no comment to the contrary. I hear your points
6184 2018-08-08 14:05:08 I shaved right after the shower tho (because I needed a mirror)

will keep tea tree oil in mind tho
6185 2018-08-08 14:05:04 Two words - oil & money.
6186 2018-08-08 14:04:54 US #WTI #oil prices drop 2% as #China announces #tariffs on $16bn of US goods from 23 August, in direct response to US action taken overnight
6187 2018-08-08 14:04:47 I will say ... there is a good argument for licensing horse massagers ... and it’s not pervy or gross. Low income people don’t need horse masseuses. It’s a service needed by wealthy people. So it attracts snake oil salesmen. Licensing is an effective form of consumer protection.
6188 2018-08-08 14:04:46 @realDonaldTrump @amnestyusa so you are a bitch to Saudi Arabia, ok oil counts more than women right, sure since grabbing her at the pu*sy is common POTUS practice....

For latex paint and stain a synthetic brush is best.
For alkyds, oil based stains,polyurethanes and clear coats a natural bristle brush is best

6192 2018-08-08 14:04:19 So why is oil getting crushed this morning? Running stops getting ready for EIA?
6193 2018-08-08 14:04:16 @CastronovoShow Tell Paul to try CBD oil as last resort on doggie before putting him down.
6194 2018-08-08 14:04:15 If Rehman khan stoop any lower she will find oil reserves
6195 2018-08-08 14:04:13 If you’re not into smellin like an Italian restaurant I’d ask her to use black pepper oil or peppermint next time! Both are great stimulants to help sooth deep tissue. Rosemary or eucalyptus could work. There’s lots of others that won’t make u smell like garlic knots 
6196 2018-08-08 14:04:12 Some Islamic countries are rich in oil but devoid of any sense of human compassion,justice, artistic or intellectual excellence. Adherence to pre-civilized ideas in 20th century.
6197 2018-08-08 14:04:12 Rick has a date with his bank lady. Lmfaooo she just wants that oil field money.
6198 2018-08-08 14:04:10 Venezuela has vast oil & gold deposits. It’s bankrupt BECAUSE of socialism. They milked the commodity sales, never reinvesting (as all socialist economies do). As their ability to exploit resources diminished, they attached any & all assets for the quick fix (see GM factory).
6199 2018-08-08 14:04:02 Morning! Feel free to break the bulls legs today 
6200 2018-08-08 14:03:59 if my count is on target Wti oil should selloff in 3rd wave fashion...inv report in 30 min..

6202 2018-08-08 14:03:43  oga actually said engine oil pack  why are you guys so mean? 
6203 2018-08-08 14:03:41 Canada must stand up to Saudi Arabia's dictatorship and expose their human rights abuses. The Saudi regime is no better than any other dictatorship violating human rights around the world, difference is oil and money.

6205 2018-08-08 14:03:25 Time for Canada to buy Iranian oil and dump the dirty head chopping brand. Looks like the Axis of Evil ( Saudi Arabia, Israel, U.S. ) is coming through in spades. 
6206 2018-08-08 14:03:16 Oil cai 2% #petr4
6207 2018-08-08 14:03:11 I hope you put the well-being of farmers, farming and farm life 1st. This then makes, for SNAP Senate vote-yeah! In all seriousness Mr. Pres. as I personally know- as a wine and olive oil maker- farming is a tough tough business.
6208 2018-08-08 14:02:51 The only reason it matters is because the people who import Saudi oil will not give up their golden goose, & Canada doesn't have the refinery capacity to turn tarsand into useable oil.
Sadly, the greediest Canadians have more rights than Saudi women also.
6209 2018-08-08 14:02:46 Saudi Arabia's complete liquidation of its Canadian equity securities, immature bonds, and other sources of cash flow appears to be a disproportionate response to this heretofore unresolved diplomatic dispute. These extreme actions have not been seen since the 70s oil embargo.
6210 2018-08-08 14:02:39 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
6211 2018-08-08 14:02:38 Well Joel if you have your way there will be oil rigs in that picture in a few years.

6215 2018-08-08 14:02:00 Hello everyone. It's good to be back again. The S&P500 futures contract opened today at 2857 (September basis) on light volume. The 2862 level has provided resistance so far for the session. We are 30 minutes away from Oil inventories..
6216 2018-08-08 14:01:56 if they like they should have engine oil pack. they will not match the players currently in the market. the perception of "Mr Biggs is expensive" is what will drain them even if they are not. Nigeria has over 70% poverty rate anyone with sense will do business for over 70%
6217 2018-08-08 14:01:56 This is funny because US oil production decreased under Bush and increased under Obama. Almost like Dems don’t care about climate change either!
6218 2018-08-08 14:01:45 Tying too much of the state’s tax collections to volatile oil and natural gas prices is not a good idea which is why I stand with my fellow teachers and #OilandGas...we need better #FundingForOklahoma #OKleg #OKlaed

6220 2018-08-08 14:01:34 @Rosie has issues. The feud began when she called him a snake oil salesman, attacking his marriages et al on The View because she disagreed w/a decision he made. When asked he said she was a real loser and off THEY went. Shes been just as vile and nasty and will not let it go.

6226 2018-08-08 14:00:49 pasó en los 80s a raíz del oil embargo pero el trend es que los sedanes van a desaparecer y se vienen trucks & small suvs (gente prefiere comodidad). Yo en lo personal prefiero los carros chiquitos.

6234 2018-08-08 14:00:17 Do any breakfast restaurants still cook with butter?  Not sure how anyone can stomach the taste of the high temperature oil they use now.  Everything tastes the same....horrible.
6235 2018-08-08 14:00:11 OIL OIL OIL.
6236 2018-08-08 13:59:48 So I’m getting my oil changed an ‘for what it’s worth’ plays as I look at your post. They play good music here.
So why am I hearing this song more now, I ask rhetorically.
6237 2018-08-08 13:59:44 Don’t drop a oil rig on your head
6238 2018-08-08 13:59:26 The Orange away gulf oil kit was the best.
6239 2018-08-08 13:59:18 Wasps dislike Peppermint Oil so they don't visit us any more.
6240 2018-08-08 13:59:04 I just googled for smoke point.
Coconut oil=177C
Palm oil=232C
Beef tallow=250C

Beef tallow is hard to find in my country. If it is available, it is expensive.
6241 2018-08-08 13:59:00 Well, WTI has been pretty exciting since 5:30 am cst US.  I guess the London offices of BP, Trafigura, Glencore, Gunvor and Vitol are having a GREAT day prior to US EIA oil storage data release in 32 min #OOTT
6242 2018-08-08 13:59:00 China is slapping additional import tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from oil and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the commerce ministry said, as the world's two largest economies escalate their trade dispute.

6247 2018-08-08 13:58:22 The fact that Canola oil is also known as rapeseed oil can’t be coincidental in this instance, can it?
6248 2018-08-08 13:58:13 Do you think the physical oil traders saw the import figure that they are talking about from last night and decided to to sell oil this morning ? Fk out of here.
6249 2018-08-08 13:58:10 Russia to double soy export in 2017/18 to 1 MMT – Russian Fat &amp; Oil Union
"Season earlier, this figure was just over 500 KMT, with 87% of the supplies had to China ". However, in the future it will be more profitable for the industry to export of processed products

6253 2018-08-08 13:57:40 Truth is that we need a revolutionary president in Nigeria. Neither Buhari, Saraki, Atiku nor Tambuwal can solve our problems. Imagine oil prices have risen to about $72pb yet the idiotic leaders will keep saying there is no money to pay salaries.
6254 2018-08-08 13:57:16 Crude oil breaks the 50 day MA --near the recent support of $6700--three lows over the past 15 sessions between 6704 and 6692 --would look to buy the next time there

6264 2018-08-08 13:55:52 I doubt that will change anything. This oil is lining up for a very aggressive selloff. These OPEC idiots oversupplied everything in the short term.
6265 2018-08-08 13:55:47 What type of oil change you talking about here bro 
6266 2018-08-08 13:55:13 เตรียมตัวไปขึ้นดอยสุดปีนี้ เอ๊าตอนนี้ชักไม่ค่อยมั่นใจ ตารางงานต้นเดือน3-7แล้วอะ อยากจะหายตัวไปเจอเพื่อนๆ

6268 2018-08-08 13:54:57 There will be no winning. Wait til oil prices rise bigly. November.
6269 2018-08-08 13:54:45 Solar power, wind power, geothermal resources. We have all these resources in abundance. Must we drink the last barrel of oil before we come to our senses?

6272 2018-08-08 13:54:38 That may have been true in 2009-2010. But Trump pulling out of the JCPA without ever stating good reasons is a YUGE win for the Russian oil industry because it puts Moscow in a leadership position with the remaining JCPA countries. It was Putin's plan. Trump executed it.
6273 2018-08-08 13:54:27 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Transmountain = helping kill #LGBTQ @vancouverpride @gayvancouver

Lambat laun mulai berbisik pilu
Namun biarlah sang waktu
Akan membuktikan semua itu

6283 2018-08-08 13:53:31 Who thinks the Oil and Gas industry was not embracing Energy Transition ? I'm happy @AAPG is now taking a different stance, with less controversial climate-denying positions as was the case recently #https://energytransition.aapg.org/2018/ #together #climate
6284 2018-08-08 13:53:28 Every time there's a Trudeau as PM the AB oil industry tanks-honorable mention goes to @RachelNotley . Sadly, 2015 voting patterns had predictably bad results.
6285 2018-08-08 13:53:25 it's roughly 2 weeks oil production at current flow rates / oil price .
6286 2018-08-08 13:53:23 Gutsy trade. IMO i am waiting for oil numbers to come and go before putting on risk. Good luck though...
6287 2018-08-08 13:53:23 i burned an impressive portion of my face with hot oil while meal-prepping and i guess this means i should stop trying to eat healthy

6295 2018-08-08 13:52:50 Iraq is no longer a theocratic dictatorship where people are sent to an industrial kill operation; led into acid baths, mass hangings, and experimental torture.

The policies of pragmatic intervention failed and the world left us hanging over rhetoric about oil and WMDs. #IraqWar
6296 2018-08-08 13:52:42 Greatest contribution US could make toward the Iranian people’s movement to establish a free,democratic Iran is to reimpose stringent sanctions on Khamenei regime’s oil exports&its Central Bank.American policy needs to catch up with the Iranian people’s Constitutional Revolution
6297 2018-08-08 13:52:25 The tweet and article would be better if they clarified no benefit with respect to vascular disease specifically. There are other (e.g. psychiatric) reasons people take fish oil that are not addressed in the meta-analysis.

6301 2018-08-08 13:51:47 wti tonight's price action would be interesting, would we have a fake sell early hrs to close up high at the end day or just pure dumping on China's retalitary tariff on Oil which probably would be factored in.what is your opinion?
6302 2018-08-08 13:51:47 Meanwhile Trudeau is still surfing.

We must stop buying oil from Saudis today.

6307 2018-08-08 13:51:13 It’d be better to set Our Island Story as a text than to give candidates this. OIL may be Whiggish to the core, but at least it’s well written, and you might pick up some actual history along the way.

The Soup of the Day is Pasta Fagioli.
6313 2018-08-08 13:50:37 The amount of $$ in circulation and the number of times it changes hands is the oil the engine if the economy needs to run. Allowing liquidity to be locked in the coffers of a few is a recipe for the engine freezing.
6314 2018-08-08 13:50:18 Bull. When one oil refinery fire affects all competing oil companies and their pricing collusion, that has nothing to do with markets. My little town of Grass Valley, Ca has the highest price in the nation?? I'm retired. Can't drive anywhere. Ca. loves it, more taxes for them.
6315 2018-08-08 13:50:15 Totally makes sense that Saudi Arabia, which is totally dependent on oil exports, would be behind an electric vehicle. SMH $TSLA

6317 2018-08-08 13:50:11 after going out last night, I went home and put some lavender oil in my diffuser and slept like a baby
6318 2018-08-08 13:50:10 oh yeah it's bad if you don't let your hair retain its oil for a while flkhg
6319 2018-08-08 13:50:06 Same reason our public land is being made available for oil and mineral ravaging, and three Trump pals from Mar-a-Lago are shadow-influencing the VA, most  likely to figure out way to squeeze profit from our veterans through crony privatization. Pure greed and exploitation.

6323 2018-08-08 13:49:35 Ive been up in the derrick of an oil rig, 75 ft in the air with ice hanging from my chin. For 12 hours, and these boys can't carry 10 bags of mulch without quitting. We not all built the same I guess, or some are in the position to not have to go hard.

6341 2018-08-08 13:47:35 Step one: when opening a business don’t do it over seas. Step two: don’t go bankrupt. Step three: don’t be a Trump because they are grifters and conmen selling snake oil.
6342 2018-08-08 13:47:34 That's the point. Amen! Now to get to the bottom of what Jesus REALLY did for mankind. He took the Holy oil from the evil priests and gave it to the common man which was a crime. He told his disciples to anoint the sick. The physical gift from God to give us everythingis CANNABIS

{Canada declares official switch to Ethanol fuels due to oil scarcity. Non-European automakers ban Canadian export.}
6347 2018-08-08 13:47:00 @jcsosazpurua The PIF is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify revenue away from oil under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The fund could eventually control more than $2 trillion in assets, according to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman./Ur op?

We've also dialed telephones, and  been away from the phone. From all phones.

As kids, our media were analog. Our gadgets were not solid state.

We've (both of us, I'm sure) thumbed in bootloaders. And smelled the hot oil of a terminal.

6365 2018-08-08 13:45:26 Type up a nice note and remind her of that policy, and add that she needs to introduce black seed oil to her body to boost her immune system.. 
6366 2018-08-08 13:45:26 They didn't get anything, there's a reason we pay £120 per padlock. Just annoyance. Sprayed oil over a container, overflowed the holding tank. Only thing they damaged was a locker door.
6367 2018-08-08 13:45:26 Hey, #SaudiArabia, quite sending your blood oil to the East(Canada) so they'll let us build pipelines and start using Alberta's.  #cdnpoli #AbLeg #Yeg

6374 2018-08-08 13:45:06 Crypto miners should play the oil game. When demand is going down, pull back on inventory. And when demand goes up you sell high. The miners seem to be just dumping as soon as the aquire alts so they can pay expenses.
6375 2018-08-08 13:44:58 Snake oil salesmen
6376 2018-08-08 13:44:56 Ummm major part of oil demand growth is not in gasoline but in lpg/ngl and infrastructure (diesel)
6377 2018-08-08 13:44:50 Nooooo, because he might get something on the sheets. Since I saw one of those "how dirty is you home" shows I've been grossed out. Dead skin, tiny mites, oil from body and then add shit to it? Nooo!Turn the light on and roll his ass over and look! Hope it was just a deadly fart!

6379 2018-08-08 13:44:22 This starts to confirm my suspicion that big oil investors have been working feverishly this past 2 years to manipulate markets to prop up their holdings in oil to sell high, & lower or de-value stocks like Tesla to buy into them as low as possible. This move is brilliant

6382 2018-08-08 13:44:15 Yep. Saw where the rod knocked the starter off. Bad day. Looks a little discolored where the rod bearing is/was. May have ran low on oil. Hard to tell with the rust on it.

You need 20 year 'vision' money. 
Existing owners, plus a few new state-funded / mega-corp owners to sweep up the remaining free float . 
Kind of ironic that Tesla could end up being the ultimate big oil toy
6385 2018-08-08 13:43:53 Yeah you just have to fry it in Sesame Oil after you cook it. The instructions don’t tell you that but I’ve made it from scratch before & the oil really sets it off.

6399 2018-08-08 13:42:47 Woke up at 2am with a hankering for bacon, now I'm tending to my tiny oil burns wondering was it all worth it.
6400 2018-08-08 13:42:46 i get really anxious to do adult stuff on my own and i just came to get an oil change all by myself :’)
6401 2018-08-08 13:42:40 check among my pictures.... i posted couple of times the world oil demand vs global car sales.... 
Oil demand serves for transportation.... maybe global energy demand that serves everything maybe affected by global trends... but only on the long run.
6402 2018-08-08 13:42:33 I don’t like it because of the oil. I don’t like meat pie, doughnut, egg roll abi buns. All of them.

In those early days, it was the perfect size for toasting garlic in olive oil to eat over spaghetti, my favorite budget meal.

6413 2018-08-08 13:41:05 I believe that oil and water can mix. It's an emulsification.
6414 2018-08-08 13:40:53 oil lower should be neg cad as well

6443 2018-08-08 13:37:38 I noticed the comment elsewhere ED. The same kind of journos that went wrong on the bottom and on the top of the oil price..... Was not you.
Having said that,  I disagree with this conclusion simply because that the oil demand is function of the car sales. Slowing for a while...

6448 2018-08-08 13:37:19 China is sending a clear signal. Imposing 25% tariffs on American oil and on the same day saying that they will not abide by Trump’s sanctions on Iran and will import Iranian oil.
This #moron is embarrassing us.

6450 2018-08-08 13:37:14 Conversation gets interesting when you consider Saudis and Chinese sovereign wealth funds.

Saudi even more so given their direct involvement in the oil cartel and they're being flush with Canadian cash.

With the purchase, China would be hedging higher Iranian oil prices.

6465 2018-08-08 13:36:05 Basically they're more or less precooked but then you fry them up on medium heat in a pan with some butter and olive oil. It's top-notch.

6470 2018-08-08 13:35:41 If you can get a hold of Eucalyptus oil (its considered an essential oil) , it will clear your blocked nose so you can at least sleep peacefully at night. Put some drops on a folded tissue and let it sit in the open, should work in 10-15.

6481 2018-08-08 13:34:43 I got a bad experience yesterday with my family when we ordered 4 pizza. All Butter containers felt out of during delivery. It was a true mess when I opened the boxes.  It turned into oil and messed the pizza. So disappointed.
6482 2018-08-08 13:34:38 Also using a charcoal face mask once a week, just on the spots you’re prone to whiteheads, really helps. I deal more with cystic acne but charcoal reduces oil production and removes toxins.
6483 2018-08-08 13:34:35 Indian and Iranian business dealings is questionable,suspicious.The truth of the facts must be found out&brought out what is the reality behind such dealings.Are the crude oil & food grains caused any mode of exchanges instead of currency or dollar?  A study is needed.

6528 2018-08-08 13:29:25 A lot of that is light oil/products that they need for the heavy oil they're mining from the oil sands. That mixture is then re-exported to the US as grades the refiners want. The flows are complicated.

6546 2018-08-08 13:27:57 What about oil and coal, could they stop using those?  Maybe just make more solar panels instead?
6547 2018-08-08 13:27:57 ただいま！
6548 2018-08-08 13:27:41 That is why I support busting up these giant tech firms. They are Monopolies. We need to treat them as such. Do to them what we did to Ma Bell and Standard Oil.

6552 2018-08-08 13:27:23 We do so little trade with #SaudiArabia this is a tempest in a teapot. What Canadians should be revisiting is #EnergyEast pipeline. Why are the Atlantic Provinces and Quebec buying foreign oil anyway? Buy Canadian, buy best!
6553 2018-08-08 13:27:22 Saudi arabia is a discusting regime. They have no respect for free speech or women.we can produce our own oil and electric cars. So why do we have to do business with such a nation.
6554 2018-08-08 13:27:17 My advisement teacher has been trying to motivate us for the past 20 mins and I need to go pee
6555 2018-08-08 13:27:16 I should have looked up because I thought Aramco an acronym for Arabian American Oil Company. Dare say the 'felt like it' was because by that stage they had sufficient expertise to take over and run.
6556 2018-08-08 13:26:58 RIP FLUORIDE!!! I believe if we use a more natural approach it works better .I just shared with my dentist last week about oil pulling and making my own tooth paste. He was amazed by results. Probably (fluoride) is more bad than good. My opinion. 
6557 2018-08-08 13:26:56 My parents don’t have any olive oil. It’s like I’m living in a low budget Airbnb.
6558 2018-08-08 13:26:52 Nothing will stop Trump except bold moves from China that would raise interest rates for the US or cause oil prices to spike from a weak USD

6561 2018-08-08 13:26:44 Canada should stop buying saudi oil.

6565 2018-08-08 13:26:23 I've seen too many comments from people saying they get their news and supplements from Alex Jones.

6569 2018-08-08 13:25:54 Why are cars so expensive..... oil change and tune up cost more than my month payment.... but it’s a once a year thing so that’s good I guess

6572 2018-08-08 13:25:45 And for what it's worth, until the oil price tanked in large part because of the boom in US production, Chavez had quadrupled VZs GDP and massively improved human development. The UN were effusive in their praise only in 2014.
6573 2018-08-08 13:25:44 So will China be getting more oil from Russia? Just asking because Trump seems to be working so hard to Make Russia Great Again!!!

6578 2018-08-08 13:25:28 Really, maybe you should read up on that.  They dismantled / nationalized PDVSA (oil co) and fired 20000 professionals, seized farms, and other businesses.  Political cronyism is why they are where they are.

If USA impose sanctions on India for trading with Iran, then we not only loose USA trade, but all $ reated transcations with non USA entities because of SWIFT system.

In non scations environment Iran had asked India to pay for oil in Euro

6592 2018-08-08 13:24:11 Let’s see, we’re losing billions in oil and gas, and now are going to lose billions in trade with Arab countries, and we’re being left behind in NAFTA talks. I wonder where all this money is going to come from???

6614 2018-08-08 13:22:30 We can all name Random stocks we have a preference too

My response would be 

CVN has 4 bagged from $150m to $600m+ mkt cap from drilling a high impact offshore oil and gas well in WA

So just make sure you personal preference stock has some similarities to CVN

Otherwise BHP?

Are these (commentaries) insane of just aggressive amateurs?
6618 2018-08-08 13:22:08 Are any of my followers lawyers or familiar with the law?

Why would Quebec and the East Coast buy your oil if you have less an understanding of marketing than Saudi Arabia?

In contrast, investments in oil and gas increased, pushing the share of #fossil fuel, for the first time since 2014. Excuse me? Has anyone in the industry heard of the #ParisAgreement?
6670 2018-08-08 13:16:53 Hi, the price of gas is linked to the increase in the cost of oil - it's not connected to how much gas people use. 23 other larger suppliers have also increased their prices this year so it's an issue that's affecting companies across our industry. Thanks ^LP

6676 2018-08-08 13:16:13 Regulations are there for a reason! I live in Michigan, surrounded by the largest Fresh Water source on the planet! And there are many cities here that are dealing with poisoned drinking water, from un regulated Corporations dumping chemicals, oil in the water!

6690 2018-08-08 13:14:48 The cost of crude oil is the largest factor in the retail price of gasoline, and it varies over time and across regions of the country.  Crude oil prices are determined by both demand and supply.  World economic growth is the most significant factor for demand.
6691 2018-08-08 13:14:44 why was NAB sleeping for last 30 years..decided to wake up now...not fit for purpose
6692 2018-08-08 13:14:42 Recently was hospitalized for chest pain with no diagnosis of a cardiac event.  The first time I got my daily meds MD had ordered fish oil, presumably to address slightly elevated chol. Disappointing to get better medical advice from Twitter.

6696 2018-08-08 13:14:14 Turns out it was tea tree oil cobretti put on it and when I left to kitty’s Sunday I put THIEVES oil on it and it was burning that whole time so idk I’m scared lol
6697 2018-08-08 13:14:13 Small is beautiful, big is shit, it is a pie in the sky  to believe renewables will suffice, man has been using free energy (fossil fuels) for too long, and look where that's got us renewables need oil and rare elements for their production, use less energy is the only solution
6698 2018-08-08 13:14:07 You can not charge you Tesla batteries without oil generators. Unless you shift to nuclear or solar power.

6703 2018-08-08 13:13:43 Yes. Just put more olive oil on top. Maybe lemon juice too. You’ve eaten worse things baby.
6704 2018-08-08 13:13:41 Those are US cars and US oil sold to China. They will cost the CHINESE 25% more. Instead of buying OUR cars and oil and other products, they will buy elsewhere. China is one of our biggest customers. If China doesn't buy our products, who will? Please read the article.

6710 2018-08-08 13:13:23 Free market???  That made me laugh. Big oil is the most crooked group behind railroads.  Both are mofia. Take away all the deep pocket backdoor deals big oil gets and then we talk.

6714 2018-08-08 13:13:10 Please...oil & gas and IT represent the bulk of it.

Here’s the deal...oil/gas investment isn’t new and doesn’t increase productivity 

FANGesque companies are investing in cloud...which does little to increase productivity without application investment.

6723 2018-08-08 13:12:39 Jones is, literally, a snake oil salesman. The point of his shows is to get the way overpriced sugar pills he sells sold.

6731 2018-08-08 13:12:20 @cafreeland To genuinely serve workers’ rights in KSA, actually encourage Canadians to consume LESS oil through, say their massive pick ups and powerboats. Don’t be part of the extraction industry with Trans Mountain #CNDpoli and #SaudiArabia
6732 2018-08-08 13:12:19 Well...Oil is just doing that today....
6733 2018-08-08 13:12:04 Yes. The UK did. And the UK and USA did it in order to control their oil.

6770 2018-08-08 13:08:38 My base case is that US establishment will bend over backwards to ensure Turkey is not "lost" to Russia.  Re China, there is room for more lending as part of B&R, and maybe that, with rate hikes, a stronger EUR and weaker oil, might allow TRY to stabilise around 4.5/5

6790 2018-08-08 13:06:37 The same reason they are rolling back fuel efficiency regulations in the auto industry. Oil is Russia's primary export and keeping demand and prices up will benefit them greatly.

6810 2018-08-08 13:05:23 Turn off heat and add globs of Thai roasted chili condiment if you have it—any other roasted chili or chili oil will work along with a sprinkling of salt and sugar if not. Toss and consume. Warning: this is addictive.

6816 2018-08-08 13:05:11 Can I point out petrol cars will go. But gas and oil will be required to build there replacements for the next 100 years at least. Glass, requires heat to create and recycle, this is provided by gas. Plastics are made with oil. Steel requires the carbon from coal.
6817 2018-08-08 13:04:41 Saudi Arabia will cease oil shipments to Eastern Canada. Fellow Canadian living in the lovely East Canada, Alberta can provide you with secure supply, responsibly produced oil, you need the PIPELINE to liberate youselve from being enslaved to the Saudi oil.

6831 2018-08-08 13:02:46 Yesterday two of us were able to establish via email that “we use different writing tests for each candidate” is not true. I completed a writing test for them, and another writer who was sent a writing test contacted me and asked, “my test was about an oil well, was yours?” Yes.
6832 2018-08-08 13:02:42 The issue is that Obama didn't really use enormous US leverage (see Trump's unilateral oil sales sanctions) to bludgeon Iran into accepting a painful nuke deal. Instead he gave himself a wedgie, stuffed himself in a locker, and wrote friendly missives to Iran's Supreme Leader.

6856 2018-08-08 13:00:44 OK, first of all, if you’ve gone to all the trouble of massaging it (I believe no vegetable deserves a massage) chiffonade it (roll leaves up and slice super thin) then douse liberally with lemon juice, olive oil and salt and consume.

6861 2018-08-08 13:00:22 Seeing what Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling palm-oil
6862 2018-08-08 13:00:21 Why? You rather have the Saudi’s pumping up more oil?
6863 2018-08-08 13:00:20 I read it. SA has had all that wealth from oil all these decades and squandered their chance to put that wealth to good use. They chose to live in the dark ages..now they want to slowly creep out of it and wonder why it's hard. Repress women and you repress your own progress.

6931 2018-08-08 12:53:27 Saudi Arabia have invested in Tesla . Also, electric batteries are made of oil. In addition, Saudi Arabia have invested on clean energy with solar panels where it does have the most pure silica in the world in its own sand. As a citizen of this country, I’m proud to be.
6932 2018-08-08 12:53:20 Nafdac May be more to blame to be honest. In a past life, I co ran a company in partnership with Engen, an oil company out of SA. We used to bring in the lubes and had to get NAFDAC approval for each shipment. Took months, even with buttons pressed

Certainly great news today for SCC and Angus Energy you have got to get into these stocks and look into the Weald oil and what is happening right now.
Portland tests and Kimmeridge tests from on shore UK oil and gas. It is just massive.

6985 2018-08-08 12:47:27 Given the influence of the oil industry, I’m not optimistic that we will lower CO2 emissions any time soon.  We are just like most animal species populations—reproduce until they foul their nests until their environment will no longer support them. Then the population crashes.

7027 2018-08-08 12:42:57 We love voting against our own interests in this country.  I’ll never understand why.  Canada not shipping oil will have zero impact on global consumption because our competitors are more than happy to increase production and pick up the slack.

7135 2018-08-08 12:30:11 BoC has tried to tamp down on it without crashing the market by leveling foreign investor fees. Another problem = the construction industry in Canada was booming b/c of the market. Causing a downturn in it would’ve been disastrous during low(ish) oil prices.
7136 2018-08-08 12:30:05 They aren’t the only ones. There’s a handful. If anything, let her know that CBD Oil is absolutely a great product, but the MLM’s have exaggerated things so much. She wants to be believed when she spreads the good word not be the craziest in the room :)

7140 2018-08-08 12:29:33 Telegraph still telling us oil is running out! Also poor quality.
7141 2018-08-08 12:29:29 It’s literally my favorite salad right now. Add some shelled edamame and sesame oil and soy sauce for the tender tastiest salad.
7142 2018-08-08 12:29:28 So oil is not in your export calculations. Glad we sorted that out.
7143 2018-08-08 12:29:27 Yes it is. If we can add 1.2 trillion to deficit 2 give payday 2 megawealthy, we can & must invest in electric cars, solar, hydro, updating transmission lines, efficiency tech, fuel cells, renewable r&d. Stemming climate disaster in age of coal/oil loving potus means investment!
7144 2018-08-08 12:29:24 If India was to replace China's US crude flows, India's crude oil imports from the US would need to surge to 800 kb/d... a bit much...
7145 2018-08-08 12:29:23 That is amazinggggg! I was going to add changing oil & air filter but I actually want to learn how to do that too
7146 2018-08-08 12:28:38 My (non-lawyer) reading of DASKA bill raises real concerns for anyone providing financing or equipment to heretofore unsanctioned Russian oil firms like Lukoil. Also, it seems ban on dealing in RU sovereign debt would apply to OFZs (ruble-denominated bonds) as well as $ bonds...
7147 2018-08-08 12:28:33 The technarati also seem to find this ridiculous/troubling.  Something theoretically good and possible, in the future, but this appears to be snake oil.

7149 2018-08-08 12:28:25 I mean sure, one can potentially outperform the market by buying individual stocks but there is zero realistic probability of doing so and thus leading with it taints the claim with snake oil/boiler room style odors. Outperformance as first claim will not help industry over time.
7150 2018-08-08 12:28:23 @680NEWS here's a radical out of the box idea, build refineries in Canada, then refine the Canadian Oil in Canada and then sell it. is that too radical an idea for the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives in Ottawa?
7151 2018-08-08 12:28:21 Well, if it's being quashed by the less than righteous, I say go private.  We also need a car that runs on air.  A solar car was also bought and given the kibosh by BIG OIL.  It's time for a change.
7152 2018-08-08 12:28:16 Don't be fooled, the Chinese tariffs on US crude oil won't mean anything.  Moar refiners have stopped buying US crude anyway last month

7169 2018-08-08 12:26:46 #warp @BBCRadio4 #energy price rises. If there’s a time lag, when’ll the consumers see a reduction in prices as a result of low oil prices last year? It’s all a bit of a swizz really.
7170 2018-08-08 12:26:41 Gas - UK North Sea Gas ended extraction about five years ago as the fields were exhausted.  The gar was brought ashore near Cleethorpes (England).  The UK government is currently subsidising the extraction of North Sea Oil and the tax take for the last tow years was...zero.
7171 2018-08-08 12:26:27 Your country doesn’t respect human rights and that’s a big reason why we have lots of Saudis moving here.  Women are people too.  I hope the Saudis cut everything off from Canada, especially oil.  We don’t really need it.
7172 2018-08-08 12:26:23 It’s not hard to see it works- giving CBD oil to my arthritic 15 1/2 year old dog and he’s sleeping better, eating better, and just seems all around happier. I don’t think they need marijuana with THC to get results.
7173 2018-08-08 12:26:02 Really? I clearly remember paying almost $4/gal under Obama. And that was here in Texas, an oil state! How long have you been putting gas in vehicles?

7178 2018-08-08 12:25:10 Is JT smart enough to plan a shortage of oil and gas to ‘protect the environment’?  Killed pipelines, now ticked off oil producing countries.  Next will be banning wood stoves?

7379 2018-08-08 12:01:23 Reading comprehension. UN is raising this issue, not Canada, & hey, if we have no further relationship with the KSA I'm fine with that, their human rights abuses are ridiculous, the West's virtue signaling disappears when it comes to oil rich nations.

7454 2018-08-08 11:51:41 So why did we get involved then? Oh, let me think... greed & oil
7455 2018-08-08 11:51:23 Sure consumption is going up in countries like China and India as they develop and build wealth. But it's unlikely that as rapidly as electric car technology improves and gets less expensive. That these oil consumption numbers won't stabilize and reverse in the next 5-20 years.
7456 2018-08-08 11:50:52 I know this might sound gross but it worked for my little guy when he was blocked at that age.  I stripped him naked and made sure he was comfortable.  I nursed him and then rubbed some coconut oil around his anus and massaged the area while he nursed for 10-15 minutes.
7457 2018-08-08 11:50:45 Lots of tough talk in this thread from people who don't realize how much oil comes from Saudi Arabia
7458 2018-08-08 11:50:30 First, I don’t believe the inference suggested by this tweet.  Second, how much taxpayer money did Trump, Obama and Bush send to the US oil industry and the Koch Bros?

7494 2018-08-08 11:45:35 I suppose it would depend on the quality of the batter and the oil but the idea of a deep fried mars bar has always kind of grossed me out.

7499 2018-08-08 11:45:14 Maybe it’s part of the Saudi’s master plan, but $TSLA, bankrupt it and say EV was a fad, get oil back to $120 and do the IPO
7500 2018-08-08 11:45:11 harsh criticism in the name of #lean is unnecessary when the vision aligns with the elimination of waste on a larger scale. And it’s not a conspiracy that “big” oil has more power and money than electric.

7556 2018-08-08 11:37:32 Not a good one though, and I don't think a dangerous one for us.  When they embraced Capitalism, they focused nearly entirely on oil to the detriment of the rest of their economy.  They are courting great disaster because when the oil goes, they go.

7558 2018-08-08 11:37:19 Carl,  You usually post puff pieces.   But here you are ready to do big oil a favor.  Of course CNBC supports big oil.    Tesla is not distressed.  I made 96,000.00 yesterday on TSLA and will buy the Model X

BYE BYE PLANET!

7568 2018-08-08 11:36:03 Never had any reactions to food until I cut out gluten, dairy, soya and fruit. Now olive oil doesn’t do me any good. Everything else is a ‘fingers crossed’ situation. 

Back to the steamed veg and rice for me for at least a few days.

7571 2018-08-08 11:35:24 What is it with conservatives and facts? I guess they all forget it was conservatives who blocked Canada from becoming energy independent. They do not work for the people of Canada, they work for foreign oil companies.
7572 2018-08-08 11:35:18 doug,  are you working for big oil?  Its the only way to get on business television.

7575 2018-08-08 11:34:43 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
7576 2018-08-08 11:34:22 We’re pissing the wind with sanctions on manufactured goods. Oil is Iran’s cash cow.
7577 2018-08-08 11:34:09 This doesn't sound like good news for China oil imports: Xi urging state-owned energy giants to boost domestic oil and gas production. CNPC and CNOOC said they got "important instructions" to do this amid the escalating trade dispute #OOTT @business
7578 2018-08-08 11:33:58 Also the rise of Wahhabism stemming from US backed oil@money flowing into Saudi, is the reason you see a rise in hard right dogmas around the Islamic world. But even within that, politics aside, there are people legitimately choosing the Burka, as a nun would choose the habit.
7579 2018-08-08 11:33:51 OK, please read. Governors have everything to do W/ how much traitor-Trump impacts our daily lives. Hamilton taught us it was designed so that state govts can be used as not only a moat/ drawbridge BUT as a boiling pot of oil when the Federal Government became tyrannical.
7580 2018-08-08 11:33:48 A zero-sum game. Iran losing India and gaining China in terms of Oil imports.India has booked a total of 9.94 million barrels of crude, about 319,000 bpd to arrive from the US this month.

7611 2018-08-08 11:29:21 It might seem like a simple solution, but banning palm oil could displace associated issues elsewhere. For example, a recent report from @IUCN highlights that if we ban palm oil, "more land-hungry oils will likely take its place". With more than 40% of palm oil grown by 1/2

7630 2018-08-08 11:27:13 Probably ignorance on my part but can't help thinking these spikes up and then back down to "last week's price," with no significant change to oil prices are a rouse by gas companies to gouge the consumer.  I am sure I am wrong. ;-)

7633 2018-08-08 11:26:27 All those discoveries are tight oil which has a low EROEI. They are yet to discover an element that store energy with the versatility as fuel for use in electric cars, plus their value chain are heavily reliant on coal and oil in the first place.

7721 2018-08-08 11:16:11 S.A. wants to refocus its economy to be less oil based. Well this should scare off potential trading partners if they’re going to throw a temper tantrum and unreasonably punish anyone for saying something they don’t like.

7767 2018-08-08 11:10:28 An article written in March when oil price was $20 lower than it is now.
7768 2018-08-08 11:10:27 To cover the country with the same concentration of chemicals that a crop duster squirts out, you'd need roughly 120 billion gallons of the stuff. That's just one dose, and it's already several times more than what all the world's oil tankers can carry.

7810 2018-08-08 11:04:49 That's for sure Jim. If you suffer from it, I really recommend CBD oil, for me it was a miracle. I'm nowdoing stuff that I never thought I'd be able to do again. I get mine from CannasseursUK, they were recommended to me. 
7811 2018-08-08 11:04:48 Thank you for sharing. The #RSPO Trademark is an assurance to consumers that the palm oil used in the product has been grown according to environmental and social criteria for the production of #sustainable #palmoil. @WWF also has a great tool to check

7816 2018-08-08 11:03:57 Also if we could send our oil out east, then we could make it so that the oil that is purchased by the US then would be at market prices ratherthan at a discount. More money in Canadian coffers.

7822 2018-08-08 11:03:26 Thank you for your opinion, but does the fact that the US buys prairie oil for cheap and has refineries that will handle it make the business case for infrastructure investment in Eastern Canada to compete with US buyers? I'm not convinced it does.

7837 2018-08-08 11:01:44 Also there is pipe right in the ground that could be used to send out east. It used to used to send products out West and just need a permit to reuse as reverse pipe and then to build a few KM and we could have oil going to the eastern refineries.
7838 2018-08-08 11:01:09 thermal power stations were never feasible for Pakistan as we are major oil importer. we'd seek alternative sources of enrgy more imprtntly we need to build more hydal statns which will greatly reduce cost of electricity in Pak which is main driver for economies like Pakistan.

7851 2018-08-08 10:59:45 We have to pay for oil in $ like the rest of the world and for imports in other currencies unless the sellers will accept £. Monetary sovereignty enables the government to buy anything that’s for sale in its own currency, not foreign currencies.

7868 2018-08-08 10:56:25 The early, small stages of reform in Saudi may be significant and I hope for the best. Significantly it probably reflects Saudi recognition that the US will no longer fight to protect oil fields it doesn’t need as it once did.

7916 2018-08-08 10:48:39 Totally agree Canada has a shit load of oil, but the stupid governments over the years never figured we would need a refinery, we have one in NFLD,our inland oil has to be refined out of the country then brought back,big $$ , cities have access to gas , no so much in rural areas

7923 2018-08-08 10:47:25 But you are okay w/ tankers coming into Canada with large amounts of oil that could have larger environmental impact & you are okay with having your oil coming from a country that does not care about human rights. What are you doing to change your carbon footprint?
7924 2018-08-08 10:47:10 Oh my, that looks amazing... One of those Secret History of Our Streets programmes looked at an Aberdeenshire model fishing community and what happened when the oil came, it was great, the Fittie Squares it were called.
7925 2018-08-08 10:46:56 So what plenty of wee countries went independent without oil Jill & even if oil prices are lower it's still income at the end of the day & would still bolster the coffers of an independent Scotland our share of revenue from north sea is not great within the UK that would change.
7926 2018-08-08 10:46:54 It is for his bones and not cancer. His leg is badly broken for nearly a year .The oil repairs bone and makes it incredibly strong.

7943 2018-08-08 10:44:56 I don’t know how true it is - but the story goes during the first oil shock in the 70s and after Aramco was nationalised Kissinger & Nixon were seriously contemplating invading Saudi Arabia  

But too much military assets was stuck in Vietnam - and no British/French support

8039 2018-08-08 10:27:30 Scotland has subsidised England for over 40 years. Norway with similar population and Oil reserves now has an Oil Fund of £2Trillion where is Scotland's Oil Fund... Oh yes, that's right, England spent it on England

8047 2018-08-08 10:25:41 we had a crop of tomatoes, one year, only half turned red. Do I sliced them, and fried the green ones in a little butter, and oil :) Also made green tomato pasta sauce. Admittedly brain went, wtf? when saw it, but was yum.

8063 2018-08-08 10:23:16 Fracking for CH4 is better than mining coal but is still a Faustian bargain. Short term job growth and lower oil imports at the cost of a contaminated water table. Using renewables as an energy source is not the problem in most places, it’s a lack of storage. It can be done.
8064 2018-08-08 10:23:09 Rösti is a potato dish made by frying (or occasionally baking) flat round patties of coarsely grated raw or partboiled (semi-cooked), seasoned potato in oil. They're crisp on the outside and soft and melting inside. And just delicious

8074 2018-08-08 10:20:47 The markets have seen another steady increase with the rise in price of Crude Oil being the main factor. Oil surged higher yesterday in response to the renewed US Sanctions on Iran. Gas demand has increased, but this has been checked by a comfortably supplied system.
8075 2018-08-08 10:20:38 Why would they even want to consider playing for a oil rich team?
8076 2018-08-08 10:20:32 I have not forgotten. That was such a terrible disappointment. I wrote a song called "Oil Burning".

8078 2018-08-08 10:20:13 I have heard coconut oil is not good for skin considering it’s so dense it just sits without soaking in and clogs your pores. HOWEVER I believe that later to be true and haven’t considered it that way. Maybe I will continue the one I have now and use my loving words to heal it

8080 2018-08-08 10:19:58 There are prospects of offshore oil reserves in Somalia. Capital target mineral rich countries and they sponsor insurgency; and they do not even care how many people die. All they care about is their greed. You seem to know too little about conspiracy of capitalism.

8102 2018-08-08 10:15:45 "I can do that" he said with a small grin. He could do it without burning anything as well. He grabbed a pan, started heating it up on the job, putting a small drizzle of olive oil in before placing the sliced chicken into the pan. 

He may have watched a lot of cooking shows.

8136 2018-08-08 10:09:13 I hate the anti trust laws. Oil use at that time was so minimal it didn’t matter. Today is a different story because it is about INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS! The 1st ammendment is at stake, not some purchasing power.

8150 2018-08-08 10:06:50 Nigeria is the only #OPEC country without an oil refinery in a foreign country. Even Venezuela owns a refinery in the US!
8151 2018-08-08 10:06:43 Canada is going to have to choose. Do we want foreign oil or become independent? If we are going to rely on countries like Saudi Arabia for oil and medical students, were going to have to shut up about rights violations. You can’t have it both ways.

8160 2018-08-08 10:04:24 The trick is to invest in castor oil for after removal aftercare and getting them professionally removed, to avoid damaging your real lashes. Where is this special?

8167 2018-08-08 10:03:38 Why don't you just chuck us out of the UK? We'll keep all our own money and you can keep yours without having to "subsidise" us . Oil, whisky, tourism,  tech. All ours!

8320 2018-08-08 09:31:18 I’ve seen you use Young Living Essential Oils before, do you happen to have any of their digits on hand?? If so, use a drop of that with a drop of coconut oil as a carrier oil and rub it on Tommy’s tummy. That should help with the pooping and then he would be able to eat more.

Not really ambitious. Even if the talk about "total energy consumption" and not electricity only. 
With that speed you would need ages to move away from oil. Not good for the environment and your own pocket.

8378 2018-08-08 09:19:10 I share in your thought. However, states will pay according to their strength as they are expected to leave their comfort zone of HCFs and AGs converging in FCT to share oil proceeds.

8488 2018-08-08 08:56:38 David got the right answer, similar to gold and oil being priced in USD, moves are reflected in commodities. About etoro sentiment it's not market sentiment but rather what users on the platform do. Most retail investors buy coins rather than shorting and that's visible there.

8536 2018-08-08 08:44:36 I disagree with oil. If we published the price at the pump on a per gallon basis the public would be horrified and demand a cut in price. I remember the days when an increase of 5p per gallon was headline news.
8537 2018-08-08 08:44:19 But I agree. It is madness for a business to bet its future on a constant supply of oil or gas, a finite resource and one from regions not a watchword for political stability.

8611 2018-08-08 08:29:54 OK, I see your point. Listing owning oil stocks along with Kremlin connections didn’t really convey that the real problem was the hypocrisy, not the owning of the index funds themselves. But I guess that was implicit since everyone knows her holier-than-though schtick.

8705 2018-08-08 08:09:54 Yes, I am tired of America trying to control oil. America needs to help Countries take control of their Democracies so their people can vote and we can all   Negotiate equally. I will ride a bike or a snowmobile to get to work or buy groceries until we do this.
8706 2018-08-08 08:09:33 I used to use a mixture of ho eye and baking soda. Not too much of the latter b/c it can be a harsh exfoliant. Now I use pure almond oil and a warm cloth.

8708 2018-08-08 08:09:09 Seeing the kind of development in Qatar and Saudi Arabia with their oil money, makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil

8719 2018-08-08 08:06:58 Would love to see how fucked they would be (alongside everyone else) if the entire oil industry left NZ completely and absolutely. But keep it up anti oil protesters, your just making yourselves look like dicks.
8720 2018-08-08 08:06:40 as far the fire's victims...years ago people complained that Bush asked Americans to do their part to conserve oil as he flew to areas damaged by Katrina...if he hadn't they would've complained he didn't give a damn about the victims...damned if you do damned if you don't....
8721 2018-08-08 08:06:25 And the republicans plan to strip this country of natural resources & drill for oil in our national parks.
8722 2018-08-08 08:06:23 @MrStanleyNwabia @SenatorAkpabio another major setback for south-south politics, our politicians have fish mind and oil brain
8723 2018-08-08 08:06:18 @KyleKulinski @cenkuygur Cashed out and took off from the drama..Like a snake oil salesman
8724 2018-08-08 08:06:13 How many chaos were there when STX was imposed?  Still exporters pay and apply for refund for which they have to bribe people for refund.  Even present government has not exempted exports from GST and they have to pay and get refund for which they have to oil the palms.
8725 2018-08-08 08:05:56 This led to all the different groups going after different agendas...Isis captured several oil fields in Syria then Iraq and was selling in the black market (one of the things that led to fall in oil prices)..this allowed Isis to recruit more fighters & things went crazy

8737 2018-08-08 08:03:18 yes, I know Russia is interesting to sell us arms and waste our oil revenue in the proxy war in Syria, and working with the USA on the side, only using us for their own purpose. all business is about selling arms and making money, not human rights.
8738 2018-08-08 08:03:17 It's in so many things. Make sure when you cook with oil it's not "vegetable oil" because that's soy beans. Use canola or olive. Soy js in energy bars, veggie burgers and even pasta sauce

8747 2018-08-08 08:01:53 So it's butter+ black coffee+ coconut oil?
8748 2018-08-08 08:01:45 Ha ha - yes, the "I don't like aubergine" people round the table are a firm favourite. "WE'LL SEE, BITCH!!"

I think that one of the problems is that traditionally in a lot of mediterranean dishes it's cooked with a lot of oil, but it absorbs oil like a sponge, so it's too oily.

8825 2018-08-08 07:47:32 That 401(k) story was bogus. Index funds hold hundreds of companies. The cheapest way to invest term is to literally own the whole market… which, yes, includes oil Cos. Asking people to jump through hoops (and pay much higher fees) to exclude oil from portfolio is unreasonable.

Canadian total oil production per day approx 3,900,000 barrels
Canadian total oil exports per day approx 3,100,000 barrels

But unfortunately Canada does not own its oil once it leaves the ground so we can't control where it goes.

@GovRickScott for over 7 years has avoided public disclosure of his investments  and his wealth has increased $46M. He has backed oil drilling in the Everglades & he is invested in a company that wants to drill in the Everglades.
8855 2018-08-08 07:42:04 People are worried about Kronke, truth is none of know for sure what his real intentions are? Just because he's not a rich oil tycoon we are scared of what he might do? Hopefully he will continue to run it soundly but with more success than recent years.

In case of India, 1.34 billion people.

8896 2018-08-08 07:35:10 @realDonaldTrump India will never tolerate impunity, India must completely stop Iranian oil by November, there is no good negotiation, countries that support terrorism should be punished. The United States can and should be able to zero oil exports by November 4th.

8904 2018-08-08 07:33:20 @realDonaldTrump You can give the money to the Iranian regime, sanctions must be fully implemented. At any rate, we will not allow a country to be exempted from sanctions on oil, especially India and China.

8908 2018-08-08 07:32:48 @realDonaldTrump In the case of the delivery of any currency to the Iranian regime and the export of oil, there should not be any exemption because they use these funds to support terrorism and build nuclear weapons
8909 2018-08-08 07:32:43 for many of us understand that we are not willing to sacrifice the entire use of fossil fuels, big oil, plastics, agricultural exhaustion...
8910 2018-08-08 07:32:06 @realDonaldTrump In the case of sanctions, I must mention a few important issues: first, it should not be allowed to enter Iran in any currency, and secondly, by November, the Iranian regime should not be able to export a barrel of oil; these two issues are vital and vital.

8991 2018-08-08 07:16:04 @jongaunt - if you have no yet tried it, you must get hold of some Secreto Iberico. Cut off white fat. Cut into strips across the grain. Marinade in olive oil, salt and pepper at room temperature. Griddle strips until golden brown. Delicious. Seriously, the best fat ever.
8992 2018-08-08 07:15:33 Nigeria and other African countries are also rich in oil and other resources but they stand no where in the world. Japan has no mineral resources but it’s 4th largest economy. So remember that resources don’t matter, what matters is the leadership, it’s vision & honesty

8997 2018-08-08 07:14:49 Don't worry. Oil will surely be found in the offshore concession area near Iran,  Oman, Gulf area. There is strong likelihood of that in view of its close proximity to oil finds by all other littoral States.
8998 2018-08-08 07:14:20 They are just a bunch of ignorant a-holes, hope they enjoy watching Trump destroy the environment, drilling for oil in our Parks, etc! If they need tissues for their tears as the last tree is cut down, let me know, maybe I will send them a box!

9025 2018-08-08 07:08:52 A 100ml oil has about 60% Omega 6, and about 23% Omega 6 which roughly gives you the perfect ratio of 3:1.

9057 2018-08-08 07:02:29 Socialism = bad. Venezuelan socialism is different from democratic socialism though (not a huge fan of the latter either). The number of industries that were nationalized (such as oil, finance, agriculture, etc) and Chavez's recklessness with money is what ruined them in the end.

9087 2018-08-08 06:57:33 But the increased output is due to very destructive fracking, isn't it? Wouldn't it be more strategic to buy oil at rock bottom prices from countries like Venezuela in order to retain our natural reserves? When other country's wells run dry, we'll still have some crude in shale.

9090 2018-08-08 06:57:14 My recommendation to the new president of DDS or Ogadenia Mr "Ilkacase" is that he should increase the number of the Liyu bolis by at least another hundred percent, also he shouldn't accept anything less than 40% of the Ogadenia Oil and Gas. For Ogadenia to become a sovereign

9107 2018-08-08 06:54:20 Body scrub recipe for soft skin:

- 1/8 cup virgin coconut oil
- 1 tsp rock salt
- cinnamon*
- buko pandan flavor*

*- optional para mabango, use as many as you want!! I used 2 drops buko pandan and about 2 tsp cinnamon

Favorite scrub recipe so far

9110 2018-08-08 06:53:46 Darn car would NOT start since the oil was everywhere! WAY back when there was a device that plugged into the cigarette lighter and it had graphite in it, you would insert the plug and clean it. It was a good day when the battery wasn't dead to run it.

9112 2018-08-08 06:53:25 With this visit by the VP Osinbajo, we are seeing the current administration’s continued effort to look beyond oil to developing other areas of the economy.This will lure global investors & help grow our digital economy by attracting notable investments to fix her infrastructure!
9113 2018-08-08 06:53:24 so true so true. it's so hard to convince ppl (especially those diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension) to change their diet because brown rice? mahal olive oil, canola oil? sebotol lg kecik dr normal palm oil tp mahal :/

9432 2018-08-08 05:55:51 And stating that the difference is “just scale” is downright disingenuous. I’m sure Rockefeller would have liked that defence when they were breaking up Standard Oil.

9436 2018-08-08 05:55:19 Saudi Arabia just invested 2 billion in #Tesla. An oil rich country just invested in an electric car. The ramifications of this move for the environment, electric cars, clean energy, etc is huge. This could be the paradigm shift it takes to make real change

Do not do this over live flame. 2. As with anything going on high heat, save sugar sauces for finishing to prevent burning.

9558 2018-08-08 05:33:22 Definitely!  I believe that some analysts and speculators had been manipulating the stock.   Furthermore, the oil and IC cartels know it; if you can beat them join them.  I am of the impression that it will be some follow up on this saga later.
9559 2018-08-08 05:33:10 Olive oil and balsamic vinegar. That’s it, except salt and pepper to taste.
9560 2018-08-08 05:33:01 Shout out to the cab driver who (in a well-meaning but ill-informed way) told me that if only I ate more salad and olive oil, I wouldn't have to inject with insulin any more... #diabetes #everyonesanexpert
9561 2018-08-08 05:32:56 Just wondering if u could add (IWTS) Inland Water transport System on River Sindh. just some infra-structure, navigation and dredging required, but would reduce oil import bills, road maintenance, burden on road and very less cost of transportation than road and rail.
9562 2018-08-08 05:32:41 Hey, they have to get their money from somewhere. While the rest of the world is too busy bitching on @Tesla and @elonmusk, fucking Saudi Arabia is actually financing them.

At least all that dirty, bloody oil money is going somewhere useful.
9563 2018-08-08 05:32:39 Thank you my love I have used olive oil
9564 2018-08-08 05:32:07 My favorite is rice wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper and a squeeze or two of sriracha and mix it together.

Broccoli requires steaming with garlic, then some salt and a drizzle of good olive oil, unless you're roasting it. Then garlic, olive oil, roast and then salt.

9616 2018-08-08 05:22:37 Or how about using this as an indicator to stop buying 100,000 barrels of oil per day from them. Choose blood over soil.
9617 2018-08-08 05:22:28 You will need more oil or lard on the grill though.
9618 2018-08-08 05:22:09 Asking a question you may know, does Canada export the majority of its oil, therefore would not stockpile much, to be able to sell to a Canadian market? I’m not too well informed on the topic.

Either way there is a solid half hour of brush cleaning ahead of me

9625 2018-08-08 05:21:16 I mostly use the sil-batta for pasting/ grinding masala. It's never the same! I think it's got to do with science behind it, the stone grinder presses and helps it release the oil, the mixer-grinder just cuts the masala with it's blades.

9747 2018-08-08 05:01:40 Yes I know that. 

And you're right about TMX. So let's cancel that and sell less of our oil, so the world can continue to prop up the Saudi regime. 

Or, just maybe, we make it easier to sell our oil.

9809 2018-08-08 04:52:15 Trump is a champion of the oil industry and is trying to save the coal industry.  Why would you think he has any interest in having zero point energy technology released?  It would destroy those industries he is championing.
9810 2018-08-08 04:51:41 I thought the same! But it’s made with palm oil. The light version isn’t however
9811 2018-08-08 04:51:34 Lunch debacles always crack me up. I had a buddy at work who packed a salad with an oil based dressing already on the salad. Needless to say he had a soup with floating shredded carrots by lunchtime! 
9812 2018-08-08 04:51:32 I must admit I'm happy to see all these new socialists talking about "our oil" and what "we" should do and how "we need to build refineries" and "we need to fix the situation".

The situation is capitalism.

9815 2018-08-08 04:51:14 @realDonaldTrump Lemonade stall no more. Add oil to wok. Lightly fry cashew nuts with raisins. Drop cooked rice and stir. Add turmeric and half cup or more fresh lemon juice also salt. Stir and remove from stove. Voila! Lemon rice ready. Recepi passed down by late mother Mariama.
9816 2018-08-08 04:50:59 Your argument doesn't make any sense. Most of the oil we import comes from the USA, Europe and Africa. TransMountain is strictly for export. We had to lower our oil consumption.

9828 2018-08-08 04:49:13 Bet if Canada's oil was all in Ontario this would not be a problem. For too long parts of Ontario and the political machine have held bitterness toward those getting rich off oil and gas. P. Trudeau was a perfect example.
9829 2018-08-08 04:49:03 Canadians should be embarrassed at this graph as this nation sits on the 3rd largest oil reserves. This country's messed up
9830 2018-08-08 04:48:41 I've watched a lot of Alex Jones the past two days. He's fond of turning nouns into adjectives, metaphysically. He describes his fish oil as solid liquid consciousness, which is a bit off putting. He is much funnier, knowingly, than I expected. He's going hard after China.
9831 2018-08-08 04:48:39 Everyone knows you & Putin are after Iran’s oil. Very obvious. Americans don’t want a war, only you do & you’ve been baiting it for 2 years.

9843 2018-08-08 04:47:19 One guy made millions. Corporations stand to make millions, if not trillions. Not much of a comparison. The revenue streams for 'giving talks' is dwarfed by oil, which is the lifeblood of any economy.

1. I walked into the DMV without ID got through 3 people to pick up a tag that belonged to a male in another State.  And didn't pay a penny. 
2. Free oil change after the tech told me I need $20 of extras
9851 2018-08-08 04:46:36 If the Left was honest they'd run on their core beliefs: abolition of ICE, end all deportations, open borders, abortion, identity politics, no student debt, socialized health care, tax hikes, more regulation, no oil, and an EU-like socialist-democratic foreign policy.
9852 2018-08-08 04:46:24 No one should apologize to either the Saudi terrorists or the Iranian terrorists. Different beliefs but same primitive, barbaric, savage behaviour. We don’t need their oil or their backward ideologies!

9857 2018-08-08 04:45:46 But some food costs 20x just for the craftmanship. I was once lucky to be invited to a good restaurant where they served their version of the humblest Spanish dish, sopa de ajo (garlic soup). It's garlic, bread, olive oil, red capsicum, salt, maybe an egg if you're rich.

9875 2018-08-08 04:42:05 First off, 9\11 was pathetic, secondly, if you're referring to oil, well I think it should be said the Saudis didnt put the oil underground.  Any Freudian points on connections between all the players from 9\11 are meaningless.  So I envision this entire episode as for children.

9884 2018-08-08 04:40:36 What you have to realize is those protests are funded by the hedge funds that invest in the American oil companies that employ many Albertans. So American billionaires are the ones causing the oil price to crash, laying off our workers, and then funding protests.

9886 2018-08-08 04:40:31 How true. There are forces outside Canada that traitors inside Canada are supporting in working against our independence on foreign oil. Trudeau acts like he is one of them. There are others who need to be exposed hiding behind the curtain.

Women & girls with no access to menstrual products,  or being locked in cow sheds while menstruating (this is not Korea). Infant & mortality rates are so bad in so
9893 2018-08-08 04:39:45 Nope, cuz really, any money spent on oil is a waste of resources at this point.
9894 2018-08-08 04:39:43 Oil prices held steady on Wednesday, supported by a report of rising U.S. crude inventories as well as the introduction of sanctions against Iran.
9895 2018-08-08 04:39:42 China's crude oil imports recovered slightly in July after falling for the previous two months, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from the country's smaller independent, or "teapot", refineries.

9904 2018-08-08 04:38:34 Ok, where to learn the principles given that the snake oil vendors come first in the search results?

9921 2018-08-08 04:36:49 Debating on if I’m gone wash my hair and oil it to or wait until my man get off  .
9922 2018-08-08 04:36:26 Also, not like the Saudis are trying to worry about a few $B here or there if they're signing up for the TSLA money pit as a real hedge against oil income (kind of nonsensical, but if you buy into that thinking...)

9924 2018-08-08 04:36:11 It would take way more than 8 years to get us off oil. And it definitely would need to be more than just a Democrat president in office, when most of congress on all sides are bought buy oil companies. But you right to not trust either party.

9931 2018-08-08 04:35:28 But, but, but, Swiss media has been reporting and supporting the PRO-GOVERNMENT Saudi fighters.  And the government is also supporting them.

Is this a reason I cannot promote electric vehicles in Switzerland?  Are you saying this a war for oil? Swiss silence DEAFENING!
9932 2018-08-08 04:35:24 I'm afraid some countries will just keep burning oil to run a/c, even after it becomes uninhabitable outside.

9950 2018-08-08 04:31:48 kaya walang dahilan para sabihing hindi pwede walang oil price hike baka malugi ang kumpanya. Sobra sobra pa ang kinikita ng mga petroleum companies. Ang laki ng 16% para sa buhay na pahirap ng pahirap sa madlang people. sila payaman ng payaman. price hike pa more.

9962 2018-08-08 04:29:35 Discussion re fossil fuels and climate disruption are not needed. A climate urgency plan is needed. They (oil industry etc) are causing ecocide and risking the wellbeing of future generations. More than disappointing - it is criminal

9964 2018-08-08 04:29:31 Due to the economic sanctions RUS needs PRC to sell its gas/oil. RUS has not yet been vocal about the slow Chinese creep into Central Asia which RUS considers its own sphere of influence. If PRC overreaches it will result in rebuke or possibly backlash from RUS.
9965 2018-08-08 04:29:21 Reply again, and get muted Ian. I respect you have an opinion, but you lost me when you went political, and your Big Oil orthodoxy is tiresome.

Again. Good luck to you.

Good bye.

9969 2018-08-08 04:28:54 Same thing are happening in India too since last 4 yrs, only Muslims are targeting. It means India is not safe for Muslims too. Ye sab tu part of life hai, Iraq peaceful tha kisne peace ko khatm kiya America for oil. They don't want to be Muslims united.
9970 2018-08-08 04:28:43 Don’t forget about the hypocrisy of calling them out on human rights but still buying their oil!
9971 2018-08-08 04:28:37 The @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party  has mishandled the energy file.
Northern Gateway - cancelled.  Then a tanker ban -Eagle Spirit pipeline..... 
Energy East -responsible for emissions up and downstream. Imported oil no penalties. 
TMX - last gasp. Total fail.

On an hour long drive home from the mall, the oil light comes on, some asshole start tailgating us, our Japanese takeout almost spills everywhere & I get the hiccups... All House of Cards is playing in the background.

9976 2018-08-08 04:28:05 it would be a lot better if biodiesel had left the little guys’ supply of vegetable oil alone so we could continue making our own fuel. thanks, big business. c’mon algae based fuel!!

9982 2018-08-08 04:27:09 We actually had Iran doing what the world wanted.  Now they are just going to sell OIL to other countries.  We cant anger and insult everyone on the globe and them expect them to care much what we ask of them.  
The US is being left behind with our ball like a spoiled bully.
9983 2018-08-08 04:26:58 You mean that clean and ethical oil  you mixed with Indigenous peoples blood, hypocrites!
9984 2018-08-08 04:26:41 Never happen, not with the amount of $$ flowing in defense contracts, oil and hidden pocket lining.
9985 2018-08-08 04:26:35 I'm guessing you didn't learn that while getting your PhD. You don't smoke hemp oil for cancer.  OMG!

9997 2018-08-08 04:25:04 It's true that not everyone will understand your journey as they haven't seen how much midnight oil you have burnt to achieve something, but it's ok as the almighty has, and your efforts will not go in vain. So never ever give up.
