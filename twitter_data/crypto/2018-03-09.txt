3 2018-03-09 23:59:39 確定申告でいろんな取引所の履歴に苦しめられた結果、一番問題がないのはCryptopiaという意外な結果が判明。
4 2018-03-09 23:59:23 @TwitterSupport get your shit together on the #crypto #Shadowban

You are shadowbanning good members of the #cryptotwitter community and we are losing interest in your platform.

Like + RT so @twitter will give a fuck.

5 2018-03-09 23:59:15 I tossed it out with my old crypto dreams #lambodreamsdied
6 2018-03-09 23:59:14 It is a potential project. I will decide to invest in it. let's make money with me #CRNC #Current #Crypto
7 2018-03-09 23:59:12 with all these ICO’s why would crypto tech companies like MARA, RIOTbe coming down?
8 2018-03-09 23:59:10 And then they get dumped on HARD 
9 2018-03-09 23:58:55 @bitFlyer 
一度、予告の上大規模メンテした方が良いのではないでしょうか。この注文の受け付けなさは、あまりに酷いです。
個人的にはサーバーが安定するのであれば、例え1週間取引停止しても良いと考えます。
応援しています。頑張って下さい。

あと、さっき注文通らず膨らんだ損失補てんしてくれ。
10 2018-03-09 23:58:54 #idea for @twitter & #cryptocurrency What if you could link any of your crypto wallets to your username? Get #bitcoin sent to your @ no need to remember a long string of characters. Must #KYC like you can with @civickey to qualify. This is not about #privacy
11 2018-03-09 23:58:51 Fingers crossed.
12 2018-03-09 23:58:49 But we're not used to the mass confession & de facto suicide of the virtually the whole, global criminal underworld.

Each of these people exposed will typically be connected to yet *more* people. Some on crypto/some not.

Even if they don't flip, there's a seized evidence trail.

17 2018-03-09 23:58:09 Almost a month later and we're still down. Should I HODL more? lmfao.. You idiots really think that I'd even buy BTC? Let alone at 19k... I hope when it goes back to 5-1k that you idiots learn how to spell hold correctly.
18 2018-03-09 23:57:29 Will check it out... You have been heaven sent on this.. 

Now am in a better position to (at least) have a valuable conversation about the same

Thank you
19 2018-03-09 23:57:22 bearish hidden divergence on the 4H chart. Watch out. Don't get too excited about the daily candle.
20 2018-03-11 23:59:56 Ya, I was using the default settings at first too. But I think the settings should be (20,60,120,30)
21 2018-03-11 23:59:55 Come to think about this maybe you are being sarcastic at the"crypto OG´s" most are a bunch of egotistical self proclaimed geniuses. If that´s the case show them who is boss. Read up on blockchain get in contact with honest public experts Andreas Antonopoulos and Tony @ToneVays.
22 2018-03-11 23:59:49 oh thank god
23 2018-03-11 23:59:45 誰かわからんw
会える日が待ち遠しいです
24 2018-03-11 23:59:27 That wing of crypto are the same as goldbugs and preppers.  I assume they sit around hoping for global collapse so everyone will bow to their prescience.
25 2018-03-11 23:59:20 Almost pooped my pants when I saw BLZ
26 2018-03-11 23:59:12 That is the most important rule of bitcoin? Not the fact that it is an immutable ledger? Not the fact that it is decentralized? Not that fact that is unseizable if stored properly? WTF are you talking about?
27 2018-03-11 23:59:01 That’s cool bro. Go hustle them directly and fuck off my ref link shilling. Every exchange has its issues doesn’t mean it’s a bad exchange. Out of 1000 perfectly fine accounts maybe 5 have a problem.
28 2018-03-11 23:59:01 Your Patriot Act comments are incoherent.

No offense but your opinion about whether I know how to handle a weapon is just as utterly stupid as the rest of your wrongheaded belief that your ignorance is an argument.
29 2018-03-11 23:58:56 There won't be anyone building crypto in the US at all if we don't fucking fight for our clients.
30 2018-03-11 23:58:51 I know but so far they haven’t been able to do anything about it with all honesty they might do something about it in the future when crypto is more regulated so most whales want to take advantage of pumps and dumps before regulation happens
31 2018-03-11 23:58:44 I hope the crypto currency market crashes at a tremendous rate
32 2018-03-11 23:58:35 I’ve 2-300’d and sold a number of times, liquidity is typically an issue, felt like I singlehandedly killed the 4chan market one day as it mooned and couldn’t sell a single pickle rick for 10x. Constant vigilance is fun tho bc the market and advertisements are like a 2014 dnm

34 2018-03-11 23:58:25 Cryptopia new coin releases....gotta love it....!! @1337CoinUpdates
35 2018-03-11 23:58:22 Make a video or series of vids, break it into gifs, IG posts, make sure you post it when #RAW and other shows are on with the right hashtags...  I used wrestling / crypto as examples, but whatever interests you.
36 2018-03-11 23:58:14 Do NOT PAY for #crypto #education. There is so much free information out there - everything you could ever want to know is out there - we have that thing called the internet. YouTube, Google, Twitter etc. 

Example: @BigCheds awesome newbie training guide.

39 2018-03-11 23:57:58 I agree @litecoindad is a person to follow in the #crypto world.  Dedication and perseverance is something he has. If all #crypto lovers had this all our #altcoins would do great and would no longer get connected to fluctuations of #BTC #bitcoin. Have a great upcoming week!

41 2018-03-10 23:59:39 We need to understand the movement for crypto and where it came from, and how it was/is defined. An impossible task. But the consensus is that the origins of crypto were informed by ethics and morality. And bitcoin has held true throughout. Crypto has become a stock market.
42 2018-03-10 23:59:38 Is this the same Bloomberg that was promoting #bitcoin as a good investment 2 weeks ago? 

They're worse than CNBC
43 2018-03-10 23:59:37 RT CarpeNoctom: additional bearvidence
1) failure to complete iHS
2) failure to break kumo twist
3) failure to hold weekly kijun
4) 50/200 death cross on daily soon
5) 1/4 doesnt end until May

if we dont make lower lows, target is 12650
44 2018-03-10 23:59:03 Sounds like they suit concoin
45 2018-03-10 23:58:47 Just some members of the RadCap/Paleo-lib/crypto-monarchy crowd being extremely on brand.
46 2018-03-10 23:58:45 Zoom out. Take a step back. 2 months of downside isn't abnormal. We're so used to things moving fast in crypto that we get nervous the moment they don't. 2017 had its quiet moments too, especially alts.

49 2018-03-10 23:58:01 wow great stuff. Just came across this project and am impressed. Is there an eta on staking/masternode release? Unsure if you have already touched on this
50 2018-03-10 23:57:54 No. The cat is out the bag.... because even if my gov tries to go against bitcoin, it's still my right to trade with crypto anywhere in the world if the person accepts it as payment. We as individuals are not bound to banks/credit cards to pay for purchases or services anymore.

54 2018-03-10 23:57:39 The banksters rule the world, if crypto was a threat it would be destroyed. They're still thinking of ways to control it
