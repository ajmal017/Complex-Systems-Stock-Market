2 2018-03-21 23:59:45 Weekends are tough. I’m one of those people that eats when they’re bored, which is horrible. I do 1200cal a day, less than 150 carbs and 40g of sugar. Usually never go over the sugar or carbs now
3 2018-03-21 23:59:19 PSA: Microwave popcorn is a joke, air pop corn is fluffy but tasteless. Stovetop is THE way to go. Use butter or a lower fat oil, add salt right in there and it sticks to the corn! No unpopped kernels!
4 2018-03-21 23:59:07 Plausible. Facilitating the $1T Exxon/Rosneft Arctic oil deal was part of it; shot to hell when the EU sanctioned Russia and Exxon walked from the deal.
5 2018-03-21 23:58:40 I thought Trump was a Russian plant?? Everyone knows how much Putin loves oil and gas. What percentage of the Russian GDP comes from oil and gas? We are now their direct competitor.#MAGA

7 2018-03-21 23:58:28 @bathbodyworks do you have essential oil versions of your scents? I see you have wax, but I prefer oil. I'd looooove Twilight Woods in my bedroom ;)

10 2018-03-21 23:57:55 It’s that time of year where I have to walk around smelling like tea tree oil with a greasy aloe face because my allergies like to attack my skin :))

13 2018-03-21 23:57:25 Yes, I use olive oil for low eat cooking, marinades, and dressings. I don't mind a milk olive taste. What I don't like is the pickled brine the olive is saturated with. I honestly never liked Olive Oyl, either. Never understood the fuss between Popeye and Brutus.
14 2018-03-21 23:57:08 Question: Is it possible for me to buy motor oil online and have it shipped to jam..through a company like Shipme or mailpac etc.?
15 2018-03-21 23:57:06 Maybe it was an inside job, false flag event perputated by a fat snake oil salesman who lives in a pizza store basement and likes wearing rolexes? Incredible
16 2018-03-21 23:57:02 Dear Car,

I treat you well. I buy you good gas and fill you with good oil. I love you, metal machine, more than I've ever loved a person. So why the HECK do you keep causing me problems?

Sincerely,
The Guy That Doesn't Have the Money for Your Games
17 2018-03-21 23:56:39 A2 The matzahs I always have don't have oil in them. If they did they would really change their quality as a food. Maybe they'd be wouldn't really be a bread of affliction if they were baked with oil, like the offering at the Mishkan. #parshachat

36 2018-03-21 23:56:28 I usually eat my last calories around 8, and Saturday is a disgusting mess of a cheat day.  1200-1400 calories per day, limited carbs (<120g) and sugar (<50g).  It's done wonderz for me!
37 2018-03-21 23:56:23 AMEN MY DEAR FRIEND THE OIL IS IT AMEN I AM COMING BACK MY DEAR FRIEND TO GO OUT OF THE TOMB A SECOND TIME TODAY 3-21-18 TIME IS 753PM BECAUSE I KNOW SAM HAS PUT ME IN THERE AS ALWAYS AND I WILL CALL ADT ALARM SYSTEM FOR THE SECOND TIME TODAY 3-21-18 TAKING THE KIDS OUT AGAIN
38 2018-03-21 23:56:19 Their latest report had 10.952Mbpd. I say it’s 10.728 because they don’t have half a billion barrels of storage space for crude oil.
39 2018-03-21 23:56:12 Hoy un contador (k?) me dijo que YPF, Shell y Axion hicieron lo mismo que OIL, financiarse con el ITI. Y qué es un persecución política a Lopez. Puede ser???
40 2018-03-21 23:56:10 I'm starting to love the "America loves oil" meme.  #Memes #funny
41 2018-03-21 23:56:07 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

44 2018-03-21 23:55:49 Haha yw! Probably? Never tried, but I would add olive oil or something before you freeze it so it retains moisture
45 2018-03-21 23:55:35 Hmmm wonder which brand motor oil fi throw inna the bimma ....Use castrol last time but it was on sale :'(
46 2018-03-21 23:55:15 Now let's talk about tallow candles and whale oil lamps. Idiotic "electricity" kills -- didn't you see Edison's elephant? And no doubt it will leak from the "wall sockets" and derange our youth. Artificial light will destroy humanity be divorcing us from the cycle of day and nigh
47 2018-03-21 23:55:00 There’s an essential oil that’s supposedly making men grow boobs so... if you’d like to go halvsies on an order

Do you have time to have a phone call interview with me. I am focusing on sexual assault of Native Women on reservations near pipelines an oil sites
50 2018-03-21 23:54:18 They're figuring sex sells so their ratings will go up--problem is--their listeners are tone deaf

54 2018-03-21 23:53:36 I went to my car and I see some oil like substance running from underneath it. 

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

No lights are on and I got a full inspection and oil change  about two months ago..
55 2018-03-21 23:53:23 All they have done is unburdened us from the oil wealth we would have had
56 2018-03-21 23:53:23 Y’all love that oil till it send you through that sick stage now u shitting on ya self

60 2018-03-21 23:52:39 I locked my keys in my car while I was in the middle of changing my oil and it was tragic but also I learned how to break into my own car
61 2018-03-21 23:52:34 I premix my alcohol / water and just add my oil and then normally use a big water bottle but refilling took forever so this is much easier !
62 2018-03-21 23:52:32 It's because if we sign, there will be no monopoly, in our industries anymore! Sectors, like agric, oil, mining, and manufacturing will be open to investors! Hijacking the economy,  by govt and some Nigerian indigenous business operators, will not continue! # nonsense govt#
63 2018-03-21 23:52:29 I'm the kind of person who will burn oil while cooking but execute a 3 layer chiffon cake with chocolate mousse and orange liqueur ganache perfectly
64 2018-03-21 23:52:26 we did baby oil & a baby fine tooth comb. you have to scrap it off, you can use your finger nails too. then wash it really well
65 2018-03-21 23:52:10 Natural gas still flooding the market. No need to drill for expensive oil. So glad this is a flat out fail for the trump administration. Please have zinke go home to Oklahoma and run for governor and let him ruin his own state.
66 2018-03-21 23:52:04 If we can make burn algea for fuel why are we still drilling for oil? #corruption
67 2018-03-21 23:52:01 Oil pulling is believed to help in the excretion of toxic heavy metals by saliva. Oil pulling activates salivary enzymes which absorb toxins such as chemical toxins, bacterial toxins and environmental toxins from the blood and removed from the body through the tongue.
68 2018-03-21 23:51:58 Hi there! Bio-Oil is a multi-use skincare oil that works to reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks, dry and uneven skin tone! 
69 2018-03-21 23:51:55 The U.S gave 35 billion in "foreign" economic aid in 2017 while 554,000 people were homeless that same year. It would literally take less effort and money to help our own people. But the homeless usually don't have oil or money to offer. So they get ignored.
70 2018-03-21 23:51:50 He is so wrong! P2P #therealconnection is the new oil!
71 2018-03-21 23:51:38 A) I did address intentional deception in advertising: the snake oil story, VW's "clean diesel" story, Big Tobacco, & I end by saying we should hate deception in advertising. Also, b) deception happens in nature too: the bull snake and the Australian orchid. We're not unique.

75 2018-03-21 23:51:12 おっぱい体操を再開したい。oil買わなきゃ！
76 2018-03-21 23:51:09 PERMIAN's February and  March oil production numbers are going to be off the charts..... scaling out of my long E&Ps that I bought last month..
77 2018-03-21 23:50:50 Did I hear correctly a comment from the union leader was that in NAFTA we have given up our water and oil?! What does that mean?!  In return the auto clitch is now resolved? Tell me it’s not so....They only tell us what they want us to know....
78 2018-03-21 23:50:49 Well, you’re a closed-minded evangelical that follows a very narrow view of the Bible. And, you’re from Missouri and know nothing about California other than what Bretibart tells you. Hence, I’m not surprised you think that way. I believe your church bus needs an oil change.
79 2018-03-21 23:50:41 Do you know if that’s virgin olive oil !!!!!!!?????
80 2018-03-21 23:50:20 Markets finished strange today. 10 uyr flat, stocks from +200 to soft, gold soars, oil soars. The 10 yr is what perplexed me. If fed raises too fast, slows Econ, long yields drop, dollar declines due to decline tax receipts, print more $  ????
81 2018-03-21 23:49:49 @cenkuygur @bretterlich #tytlive wasn't the oil deal that fell through worth about 6 trillion?. hmmm guess those investors got their money after all.
82 2018-03-21 23:49:46 Pity the poor oil drillers!
83 2018-03-21 23:49:22 Take some castor oil
84 2018-03-21 23:48:54 No I worked in the oil industry for 25yrs dealt with this issue for years. Funny how you never answer a question as simple as the one I asked you ?
85 2018-03-21 23:48:49 Girlies with oily skin, as a b*tch with oily/acne-prone skin, I beseech you to hydrate/moisturize your skin at least once a day. If you don’t do that your skin will produce more oil to compensate for the lack of moisture. Oily skin = dehydrated skin.
86 2018-03-21 23:48:31 Canola oil !!! Quick dip of hose end and u will get it in 4+ “!!
87 2018-03-21 23:48:25 @TheDolceDiet Any thoughts/experiences with CBD oil for aches/pains?

89 2018-03-21 23:47:24 Canola oil, large stock pot, 1 cup of popcorn plus 5 kernels. Heat oil til 5 kernels pop, turn off heat, add cup popcorn, wait 30 seconds, turn on high and pop until 2-3 seconds between pops. Add garlic salt, cayenne, onion powder, chili powder toss to coat. Enjoy!
90 2018-03-21 23:47:14 What about coconut oil? Rejuvenating and less expensive, according to anecdotal evidence
91 2018-03-21 23:46:37 Me: Good coffee today.

You: Dude, you're drinking motor oil!

*takes another sip*

Me: Fuck. You're right!

*takes another sip*
92 2018-03-21 23:46:34 Yea.  That must be why The Donald is increasing sanctions and opening up oil to hit Russian economy.
93 2018-03-21 23:46:32 Gee whiz the economy is humming. Unempployment is down. New business plus more expanding. Here in Texas one of our oil companies expanding so fast workers working overtime to catch up. Stock market is BS. Real people are working.
94 2018-03-21 23:46:12 The research paper links to formula feeding, antibiotics, cesarean section. Some infant formula's contain soybean oil (omega-6) etc. Some babies are born c-section, are formula fed from scratch and use antibiotics. A recipe for disaster? It should be studied more.
95 2018-03-21 23:46:07 And the world is saying ever again to our own genocide !
Just because France is exploiting our Oil: PETROLIUM, THATS WHY WE ENDURE ALL THESE !
FUCK THEM ALL

96 2018-03-21 23:46:01 I burnt the inside of my lip because I decided to have a spoon of hot oil. Can anyone be as dumb as me?
97 2018-03-21 23:45:51 Let's talk about #transmountain tariffs.
At $19/m3 to the Westbridge term @KM_Canada  is charging $3.05/bar to ship oil that can be sold for $25+ more than what the US pays.
Gas to fill your tank? $.019/L. Rest of BC pays avg 1.21/L.
Add .019 and you pay $1.23.

104 2018-03-21 23:45:00 Yes! Coconut oil definitely lights me up. Chocolate can be hit or miss for me... I seem to be sensitive to something in some different chocolate brands.
105 2018-03-21 23:44:52 Even the kind that's burnt on the top with the Lil oil in the bottom of the pan

107 2018-03-21 23:44:30 So far Khayre scored one count of serious fraud allegations, when he was a director of UK based Soma oil and another as a staunch supporter of Somaliàs both Islamic Courts Union and Alshabab. His latest contest was the seizure of parliament buliding.

109 2018-03-21 23:44:15 What’s the connection with coconut oil and Davina?
110 2018-03-21 23:44:07 It’s like they’re just annoying, condescending hypocrites or something.
111 2018-03-21 23:43:36 Or the Bodyshop Vitamin E Serum-In-Oil is lovely too
112 2018-03-21 23:43:30 Drilling in the gulf, and in other deep waters, slowed considerably after the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, which killed 11 workers and soiled water and beaches with oil.

116 2018-03-21 23:42:54 Ya a lot of them are just nonsense lol but coconut oil has helped me so let’s hope it helps you too lol
117 2018-03-21 23:42:37 - Bio oil apparemment c’est pas bon pour la santé mais en tout cas j’avais zéro vergetures quand j’utilisais 
118 2018-03-21 23:42:11 my parents got me CBD oil for my anxiety i love them 
119 2018-03-21 23:41:52 to invest in oil paint or water colors????
120 2018-03-21 23:41:52 I only take my car to his dealership because I know I’ll get the oil change I need and get new tires 
121 2018-03-21 23:41:43 So happy to hear you're loving the Acai Berry Eye Cream! Make sure to check out our brand new Super Fruits Oil Nourishing Eye Cream—it's the replacement for our previous Acai Berry formula!
122 2018-03-21 23:41:38 Your right and I catch the sarcasm. They are carpet baggers selling snake oil. We need more people like you .
123 2018-03-21 23:41:35 Just realized the reason why the #paint was acting so weird- a tube of acrylic had snuck into the oil kit! That’s the first time that has ever happened!
124 2018-03-21 23:41:22 I love these kinds of questions.
125 2018-03-21 23:41:14 If they don’t keep me I’m taking castor oil 
126 2018-03-21 23:41:13 It was grand, I just went "so...they produce Olive oil in Syria, don't they?" and she nodded, she laughed, then everyone laughed, and we moved on with the night.
127 2018-03-21 23:41:09 Yes it can. Takes consistency of use & regular scalp massage with the oil. Do a search on FB reviews & you’ll see some restored hairlines 
128 2018-03-21 23:40:37 “i have to drink at least 8 beers just to be able to change the oil in my truck”
129 2018-03-21 23:40:30 たらこって美味いよな！
130 2018-03-21 23:40:23 You two are unproductively pissing on each other.  The key issue with a CNY contract is that it removes the threat of SWIFT banking system sanctions on those trading oil with China.  Iran style sanctions now off the table.  On the margin, bearish for US hegemony
131 2018-03-21 23:40:22 Might have to swap out the coconut oil for some Malibu if that's the route!
132 2018-03-21 23:40:15 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
133 2018-03-21 23:40:11 The results reflected broad uncertainty among oil executives that global oil prices can remain at current levels over $60 a barrel, as well as a general preference for drilling in onshore shale fields that require smaller investments and are less risky.

135 2018-03-21 23:39:45 Something that says tea and something in a totally different container that says olive oil....you might have a point lol
136 2018-03-21 23:39:29 Does anyone with locs know a good smelling hairspray or oil you can use on your locs? Since I dont use butters and creams anymore my locs just smell normal...

148 2018-03-21 23:37:57 Trump? Mr. Scahill all that great reporting you have done, would not have been possible with the entire US Government murdering Millions for OIL! This has been going on for my entire life. You wonder why the US is hated?
149 2018-03-21 23:37:27 I keep hearing about this bio oil, does anyone have? What do you use it for? Should I invest?

152 2018-03-21 23:36:39 Most of the infant formula is using coconut and palm oil instead of milk fat . The infant formula may not even have any irish milk in it.
153 2018-03-21 23:36:39 Yeah, AFAIK the oral T options cause things like mouth ulcers and heart problems so you know, fun times. But, you know, OP can get back to me when they have a good joke about ramming a large bore needle into a muscle to shoot up with hella viscous oil every week.
154 2018-03-21 23:36:33 Definitely goal machine but lack of machine oil
155 2018-03-21 23:36:22 My skin looks so great thank you coconut oil
156 2018-03-21 23:36:15 So our president just let us know that we are not who he is working for. He is working for the benefit of big oil and his friends. Disgusting!
157 2018-03-21 23:36:14 PC is obviously very motivated to retool Oil,not sitting on his hands waiting for summer,should be an interesting off season
158 2018-03-21 23:36:06 When I was growing my hair out I made sure to rub in coconut oil like every month because it speeds up hair growth! And ya lol our hair looks pretty similar

162 2018-03-21 23:35:32 I waste all this time and don't even take the nap I need, and the dude with the dog is getting a damn oil change. I'm probably not even gonna get the dog, things like this happen all the time and I feel it in my gut. I'm tired.

165 2018-03-21 23:34:58 Trump and your cohorts what has happened to Alternate Energy research to replace the need for fossil fuel and to expand the use of these energy sources but then again you have just sold a hell of a lot of oil and mining leases both off shore and onshore for the people who Own you
166 2018-03-21 23:34:49 yes but ugh I feel like olive oil and grilled cheese? Is it worth it? And too scared to try mayo even tho it prob bangin

172 2018-03-21 23:34:00 A lot of those odd artificial looking canals were created as a result of oil and gas exploration in the early 20th century
173 2018-03-21 23:33:53 Coconut  oil is my best friend 
174 2018-03-21 23:33:22 Your Premier is paid a $50,000 bonus stipend in salary by Oil and gas companies...using tax payers money to fight carbon tax... conflict of interest

180 2018-03-21 23:32:13 Well put! After all we had to pay back War Loans to USA which only ended in 1980s! Paid for by North Sea Oil!
181 2018-03-21 23:32:11 Go easy on them. It takes a lot of time to sneak in those giveaways to oil & gas, Wall Street, and Walmart.
182 2018-03-21 23:32:07 the key to wealth isn’t difficult, you don’t need to go buy a course from a snake oil salesman to create and have it
183 2018-03-21 23:32:03 You know whats funny about this. Fuel prices have not gone down one dime in the last two years since everyone started puffing out there chests that the U.S. is now the number one oil and gas producers in the world????????

196 2018-03-21 23:29:35 So me and my dad are going to change the oil on our car, do you want the leftovers @USArmy?
197 2018-03-21 23:29:24 Just about every cosmetic and many medicines also contain petroleum. I am only mentioning this because there are people out there making loud noises about stopping oil production "cold turkey", forgetting not all gets burnt.
198 2018-03-21 23:29:20 Y'all know Zuckerborg is only sorry they got caught, right? He & other Data Oligarchs could give two shits about you and your privacy. As long as your information makes them money they're gonna keep mining/selling it. Remember kids, as @corbettreport says, "data is the new oil".
199 2018-03-21 23:29:19 You consider clean water, oil spills, poisoned food to not be specific issues or facts and fantasy? What does concern you?
200 2018-03-21 23:29:12 OK. Now if you could stop trying to cause ww3 just for your masters to get the Syrian oil that would be great
201 2018-03-21 23:29:02 Who is your Premier which has been brought out by Oil and gas companies...
202 2018-03-21 23:28:37 2 oz Oil, Cream or Salve $20
4 oz Oil. Cream or Salve $30
203 2018-03-21 23:28:29 those us army oil memes really the best since the ‘niggas be like’ era
204 2018-03-21 23:28:23 so, you do NOT trade oil at all ...glad we are clear you are an expert on that then ..thank you!
205 2018-03-21 23:28:13 Please explain to me how @KM_Canada will have BC drivers pay a toll increase on oil that is shipped overseas. Or on refined product that they don't own.

I think a $25+ bump per barrel sold (150% of what we now get) will have a significant benefit to #BC & #Canada.

208 2018-03-21 23:27:45 I've found that the oils and sauces you use to cook it tend to do more than seasoning alone. get good results by frying with peanut oil and then putting in a teaspoon or two of oyster sauce, little rice vinegar, and some sesame oil for flavor. topping it with lime is good too
209 2018-03-21 23:27:25 Don;t you think the EPA should service the oil industry? Oh, that's right, they do already. AMerica is truly Great...
210 2018-03-21 23:27:23 Dude it’s seriously a game changer. I switch what I use first moisturizer then facial oil but it has helped my dry skin so so much!
211 2018-03-21 23:27:17 The reason is, rather ironically, that the protesters are paid to protest by Oil interests from other countries. And the protesters are actually too stupid to realize this.
212 2018-03-21 23:27:17 40m/year for fishing as u want in our rich sea! Are u kidding! ur values are like a thief's mask

213 2018-03-21 23:27:01 Premier is brought out by Oil and companies.. simple as that.  Surprise, more taxes are coming to Sask by your awesome Premier...
214 2018-03-21 23:26:57 Health Update: one of my roommates scrounged up some baby oil and while I still have the blockage, a couple drops of that in my ear have restored my hearing to ~50%.
215 2018-03-21 23:26:56 Don’t disagree.  Well managed plastic is a foundation of the circular economy.  But only 4% of oil is used to make plastic.  Rest is burnt.
216 2018-03-21 23:26:54 An American oil industry consultant, Page has trenchantly opposed US sanctions on Russia. Page’s visit to Moscow did take place. Who precisely he met there is unclear. Trump was asked at a press conference if his team had had any contacts with Russian officials. He didn’t answer.
217 2018-03-21 23:26:47 i told you 280 would be a scourge. he probably would have even picked a more accurate oil interval bc it would use fewer chars
218 2018-03-21 23:26:46 I wanna try your orange olive oil cake recipe. It looks delicious and paired with the right sorbet or ice cream would be PERFECT for spring!
219 2018-03-21 23:26:46 I went to Sephora the other day and used my points, since I never use them, and one of the samples I got it the nicest moisturizing oil I’ve ever tried. Look it up online and IT’S $96. Thanks for the tease 
220 2018-03-21 23:26:43 I do not trade oil at all.  Is what just hypothesis?  Not sure I understand your question
221 2018-03-21 23:26:35 Oooooh. I’ve never used facial oil. I’ll definitely invest in some.
222 2018-03-21 23:26:32 why twitter goin in on america and oil with the memes

226 2018-03-21 23:25:53 Hate crimes up, muslim ban held up in court (illegal)clean air and water in danger, coal workers still idle (need training in new industry)oil pipelines leaking. Takeoff the rose colored glasses.

229 2018-03-21 23:25:38 it’s very light and doesn’t feel heavy at all and they have 3 types i think?? whitening, moisturizing and oil control. it’s not super super high coverage if you’re looking for that though

233 2018-03-21 23:25:20 Calculus gets trickier if capital account is opened on a limited basis through the CNY oil contract as it is said to be.  How does that change things?
234 2018-03-21 23:25:16 I Use moisturizer first and facial oil then I use IT cc cream and it has spf and is light weight but also buildable for More coverage

250 2018-03-21 23:22:39 You need to address the $50,000 salary Stipends that Moe makes ... compliments of oil and gas companies... conflict of interest. Spending tax payers money fighting carbon tax and Sask is in a big deficit..it's called conflict of interest
251 2018-03-21 23:22:14 Nice! I need to try that too. Trying to limit vegetable oil.
252 2018-03-21 23:21:50 As older siblings, we got the ranks. We overtly mean; terrorize them lil suckas. That's what we're there for.

But, younger sibs??  they slicker than oil with pranking & scheming.
253 2018-03-21 23:21:38 It isn't. It's ad hominem. If oil is the only resource you know African countries have, then you're not equip for the discourse. You should know that. You should first learn more about Africa and the history of western countries (including US) carting away with African resources

272 2018-03-21 23:19:47 So we are both agreed that Canada should stop subsidizing (at any level) cheaper oil to USA needlessly, when Canada should be just simply getting fair market value for its products. @WBrettWilson @CanadaAction #cdnpoli #bcleg #ableg

278 2018-03-21 23:19:08 99% of the scientists who study the issue tell us greenhouse gasses are changing our climate, warming our planet, which will cause huge problems for humanity, particularly when it comes to our agricultural industry. The other 1% of scientists are clearly oil funded hacks
279 2018-03-21 23:19:04 A $3Trillion industry & my understanding is Saudi is behind it, as a boost to their coffers & to expand Islam. Their oil will run out & halal payments by gullible non-muslim companies will continue to spread influence & growth of Islam, with mosques, sharia etc. We pay for it.

299 2018-03-21 23:16:11 Funny that in court today, Chevron lawyer agreed man is causing climate change and IPCC was the best science on the issue.

302 2018-03-21 23:15:39 35 years ago I had an Iraqi woman working for me as a programmer. She joked that any time someone dug in Iraq they hit oil or antiquities. She was Assyrian; could read these, would go to museums and read aloud to other visitors. Sadly, most of those museums gutted now. Lost 4ever

305 2018-03-21 23:14:50 I’m officially displaying characteristics of a middle-aged person. It’s a week night and I’m cooking a savory dish while listening to Kenny G and wondering if I should prepare these leeks with olive oil or butter. 

Oh ,curse you, squandered youth!
306 2018-03-21 23:14:46 @winknews WHY do you show marijuana buds as if the medical dispensaries sell that.  You know, damn well, the medicine comes in pills and oil. NO BUDS. Don’t show fraudulent stories.
307 2018-03-21 23:14:44 Once again data is the new crude, shale oil, gemstone. Whoever possess it, smiles readily to the bank or has the ability to cause a war.
308 2018-03-21 23:14:42 Also, humans are omnivores. We have the correct teeth. However, that shouldn’t matter since “natural” is generally a misused term. I mean oil is natural along with everything man made technically.
309 2018-03-21 23:14:24 @jarrowformulas , about your CoQ10 supps, you've got the QH absorb with liposomes as well as the basic CoQ10. If I swish my standard CoQ10 supp in my mouth with some MCT oil to emulsify can I achieve the same improved absorption? How about if I pop an egg yolk too?

312 2018-03-21 23:14:00 @jkenney can we turn off the gas pipelines to Quebec? If so will ms Nutley do this. She has not had the courage to bring BC to its knees by turning off the oil that goes there now.

317 2018-03-21 23:13:12 I’d like to also try moving away from meat.  Do you eat fish?  Guess it’s easier if you have a spouse doing it with you.  My husband always wanted meat.  When I make spaghetti squash with garlic, olive oil, fresh spinach and diced tomatoes he thinks that’s not a meal.  I love it

332 2018-03-21 23:11:22 There’s something odd about the door to door salesman in the neighbourhood. Perhaps it’s his hissing tongue and scaly skin. Or that rare oil he sold you, said to cure any illnesses. You tried it but it seemingly did nothing... sssstrange...
333 2018-03-21 23:10:47 Many thanks to Little India takeaway from Skelmanthorpe for dumping their waste at Emley glass recycling centre for the last few years. What a shame they’ve been caught and prosecuted. I’ll really miss their used cooking oil, cardboard and polystyrene littering our village.
334 2018-03-21 23:10:31 There are absolutely foreign orgs working to influence our resource policy. Some are engos. Some are resource companies. Some are neither. The idea that there is an eNGO conspiracy with us oil cos is ludicrous.

341 2018-03-21 23:09:50 Wow even for you this storey is biased. If our oil goes south it gets a 30 a barrel discount why you say well it's because they can gouge us. Just like Warren buffet making 3 billion a year shipping Canadian oil Our oil going over seas increases it value cause it's not landlocked
342 2018-03-21 23:09:47 It’ Be better when we’re #1 in renewable energy, ie solar, wind water. That’s where the future is, not dinosaur oil. Get with the program.
343 2018-03-21 23:09:25 Can Trump succeed where other US presidents failed. Some rich Saudi oil barons and princes go to sex clubs in US and Europe, buy weapons against Iran, but still donate and do nothing against Wahabis. Will prince stop funding to Wahabi charities world over to make world peaceful
344 2018-03-21 23:09:20 Why would you quote a liar? None of the oil from the east pipeline was going to be refined here.
One lie and everything else said is worthless.

Obviously not a vet, then. Discarded, disowned, left damaged yet again after another useless wa, this one  to take over oil by the USA. 

It was illegal, it was not supported by most countries, it was done by little men pretending to be big!

381 2018-03-21 23:02:44 I kinda get it, if you're worried about oil (liquid) replacing solid fat, because it might mess with consistency.
382 2018-03-21 23:02:41 Add to this the fact that Trump just pulled out of an international agreement to keep an eye on money laundering from oil rich countries and Mueller's fascination with the story George Nader has to tell. I don't know...treason? Or just plain ol' mob ties?

391 2018-03-21 23:01:59 There's no need to mandate things that the market can produce more cheaply :^) and the issue with oil & gas is that despite being more expensive, the entrenchment of the monopolistic interests of the industry mean that change is blocked even when the market would direct it

395 2018-03-21 23:01:39 It is an outright lie that the pipeline would have offset oil used in the east. Every honest person knows that none of that oil would be refined here.

419 2018-03-21 22:58:59 Why not treat imported oil like you do Canadian oil? A few environuts you coddle, do realize Canada has 36 million people and the majority of them do not agree with your bad policies. The only people you keep happy are @gmbutts and your party.
420 2018-03-21 22:58:56 Where does the upswing in US Shale Oil production fit into the energy sector valuation? The US is now on par with overseas production, yet there is a lack of communication to that effect.

422 2018-03-21 22:58:49 We also rocking green shorts with oil stains from wiping yo hands on them when you're eating
423 2018-03-21 22:58:28 DEEP FRYING ANYTHING IS SCARY! (I shallow fry everything, because hot oil terrifies me.)
424 2018-03-21 22:58:26 (also since I'm living w/ my parents rn and they don't really eat fried food & don't want atomized oil all over their house, I haven't had much opportunity to try it :B)
425 2018-03-21 22:58:13 Peppermint oil. Ginger.
426 2018-03-21 22:58:12 My bf made me this bomb ass scalp oil and it got my room smelling minty as shit lmao
427 2018-03-21 22:58:01 The current state of America and their oil memes 
428 2018-03-21 22:57:56 They need to see what a good solid summer of rehab/skating can do for this guy. He was well worth the money last season and Oil will need him if they wanna make playoffs. Gives more time to develop Bear, Jones and Eventually Boqvist
429 2018-03-21 22:57:55 running out of oil doesn’t mean no cars, it means no food. best reasonable case is something like Limits to Growth, which predicted less a cataclysm and more a decline to early-20th century living standards and a gradual population decline.
430 2018-03-21 22:57:51 Coming up on the Wire at 12 we talk to @simonjbridges about a range of issues including oil exploration. Tune in!
431 2018-03-21 22:57:45 كلام رائع وعين العقل .
432 2018-03-21 22:57:42 It seems to me that, much like @BP_pl should have been liquidated after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, @facebook should now be liquidated.
433 2018-03-21 22:57:38 I think I just successfully changed the oil in my moped and I also think I’m a mechanic now. 
434 2018-03-21 22:57:36 So happy. When you have resorted to stock in Oil of Olay... it’s the little things in life that keep you going.
435 2018-03-21 22:57:33 About time! Politicians are being bought off by arab shieks with unlimited oil funds.
436 2018-03-21 22:57:29 The book "All the Shah's Men" covers this horrible chapter. This book coupled with the gulf oil spill drives me to NEVER PURCHASE BP GASOLINE. They are the looted assets of the Iranian Oil Company
437 2018-03-21 22:57:10 This is disgusting and you will be blamed for all oil and gas spills and poisoning of air, land and water.

440 2018-03-21 22:56:58 Mostly I've never tried it bc we don't rly eat lots of fried food in my family! and again, the oil atomizes, gets airborne & then makes a film over everything nearby that you have to clean off. seems messy.
441 2018-03-21 22:56:57 Russians want to live in London cos its nice.They escape other oligarchs & distance themselves from ex-colleagues boiled in oil.Why not?
442 2018-03-21 22:56:53 Why couldn't you simply work with the current owners of the oil and gas companies?
And why the focus on oil and gas anyway?
Aren't your governments going to mandate solar and wind any day now?
443 2018-03-21 22:56:44 forget climate change and unforeseen disruptions due to tech or whatever. peak oil alone will be monumental, and diminishing energy return on investment makes a transition to the gleaming solar future afterwards nigh impossible.
444 2018-03-21 22:56:30 Then you agree that if oil falls in CNY & stays here in USD that CNY should rise v. USD, correct?
445 2018-03-21 22:56:21 Lived there. Ponca City area, then Duncan area-Halliburton, oil fields, tracking, many more crimes agst environment. When ranchers/farmers can't water stock, crops, or sell land when it fails b/c water is ON FIRE?!? Yes, there's a problem!

450 2018-03-21 22:55:51 #Facebook abuses its illegal monopoly to stifle political speech and crush competitors in way that AT&T or Standard Oil never even contemplated.

The tools for breaking illegal monopolies are already on the books. Please, @realDonaldTrump, use them!
451 2018-03-21 22:55:26 Can of tomatoes, garlic, little bit of olive oil/sugar/salt, simmer = decent lazy sauce

460 2018-03-21 22:54:03 Nothing I know of.  Has trump decided to drill for oil in any more national parks today? Or maybe allowed more coal ash to be deposited into rivers than he already did? Maybe he found another crop food pesticide to unregulate that causes even more neurological damage to kids.

465 2018-03-21 22:53:51 Saddam was no menace when he was taking American dollars and doing what he was told!

471 2018-03-21 22:53:27 Where is Teddy Roosevelt when you need him ! He broke up Standard Oil from John Rockefeller, Trump should do the same with these tech giants as well.

495 2018-03-21 22:51:03 it's really easy tbh? and you can strain and store the oil after it cools. just don't be a fool like me and pour hot oil into a plastic container. the bottom will melt instantly and you'll get scalding oil Everywhere.
496 2018-03-21 22:51:02 @chigrl if oil is behaving like this on regular weekdays, I am seriously petrified on where it will close this Friday given that almost all Fridays are a one way ticket for oil ...
497 2018-03-21 22:50:59 And who does this benefit?  It benefits US oil and gas companies by eliminating competition from Canada.  So, how many US Oil companies contribute money to these US activist groups that prevent Canada from moving and selling its oil.
498 2018-03-21 22:50:58 I just saw a recipe for an "acne fighting face mask" on IG.

507 2018-03-21 22:49:57 Everyone is saying Coconut Oil is a scam and I’m not understanding. I use it right when I get out the shower and I have the skin of the gods. You should try it before you listen to what others say.

551 2018-03-21 22:43:45 In case you’re wondering how to achieve that freshly cleaned, open house smell, the answer is *not* burning garlic and anchovy paste in olive oil.

566 2018-03-21 22:42:19 Number 1 rule when it comes to cooking: use more olive oil than the recipe calls for. Because, that’s why.
567 2018-03-21 22:42:11 If you're right that "China wants oil down", & Chris Cook is right about "US Energy Dominance strategy" (thru shale, which needs oil around here), then cheaper oil in CNY & more expensive oil in USD = rising CNY v. USD.
568 2018-03-21 22:42:09 I started making my own so I can adjust the oil proportions according to how my skin is
569 2018-03-21 22:42:03 Tuna in oil is garbage
570 2018-03-21 22:41:32 West African military base. Make them take the oil all. Chale our leaders are obviously doing a very poor job, I wouldn’t mind letting others take the wheel.
571 2018-03-21 22:41:11 2. They had all the time to move the whole world. Their blood, sweat, and oil also had to wait. The 
cloud they slept on was patient. #baconbitson #vol7
572 2018-03-21 22:41:11 Cuh that Ep of Tom and jerry when Tom was pretending to be a baby and then his man and them came by being niggaz and shit and fucked around and made that nigga have to drink castor oil never sat well with me You gotta poison me cause niggaz gon nigga song was fire tho
573 2018-03-21 22:41:10 cause you need oil & coolant in your car. See if you can find valve cover sealer . What kind of car is it
574 2018-03-21 22:41:09 Sure! That's why they stealed the oil from Deir-Ezzor, because they are the pawns!!
575 2018-03-21 22:41:08 Oil hourly :D
576 2018-03-21 22:41:04 Environmental pollution increases costs of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security Disability.  Congress and State legislatures should fine oil and coal companies trillions of dollars.
577 2018-03-21 22:40:58 This is what a domestic energy exec told me last year: 1) "What china wants, china will get."  2) "Oil traders have never had to think about FX before - they will if this contract works."
578 2018-03-21 22:40:57 What we need is a thorough investigation into Rebekkah and Jennifer Mercer, their high speed computer based stock (mainly oil) trading hedge fund, Rennaissance Technologies, Breitbart, the PACs they funded AND Cambridge Analytical/Emerdata
579 2018-03-21 22:40:56 serious mis-step to let the EE pipe flounder.  'Markets' had nothing to do with it. To allow East Canada to import 700,000 bbl/day of foreign oil, while choking AB oil going east, was sad.  U should have set an IMPORT/CO2 tax on that foreign oil.  The EE pipe would've been built
580 2018-03-21 22:40:52 Going to bed with a face full of Clarins Blue Orchid oil smothered is the most amazing feeling & smell ever. Despite looking like I've got a face full of oil I smell like a spa 
581 2018-03-21 22:40:34 so that stops the oil from running on the engine. That’s 9/10 why your car keeps getting hot
582 2018-03-21 22:40:33 America is running low on oil and have to import more from foreign countries
583 2018-03-21 22:40:28 Best hummus recipe: chick peas, olive oil, tahini, garlic, serotonin, 15 years of experience, sacrifice your first born, salt #Hummus #HummusGate
584 2018-03-21 22:40:16 $600 later , we have a full oil tank. Hopefully this will last us until next March ..... Lololol.

586 2018-03-21 22:40:11 gas prices are higher in an oil fueled, climate-change induced, mad max (or waterworld) like dystopia... 
587 2018-03-21 22:39:34 It could, coconut oil on its own is kinda rough tho, I've tried. I have a tbsp a day by I emulsify it in hot tear and a little coconut milk to get it down. The final product is not good at reducing heartburn.
588 2018-03-21 22:39:23 Please post on the production, export and imports of oil seeds 
589 2018-03-21 22:39:21 Also - buy olive oil ear drops or just olive oil .All help to clear tubes!
590 2018-03-21 22:39:15 lube made out of crushed fire ants and chili oil
591 2018-03-21 22:39:14 Yeah, it seems counter intuitive, but cleansing with oil doesn't remove the protective acid mantle, and because you're not stripping oil from your skin, it doesn't bust a gut making more
592 2018-03-21 22:39:12 Renpure professional coconut bamboo conditioner coconut milk body wash 
Burt's bees acne solutions almond oil for my beard
593 2018-03-21 22:39:09 Cauliflower went from MEH to MOAR w/this recipe.
450° oven.
Cut into 8 wedges (pie-shaped thru center stem). Line cookie sheet w foil, place wedges, drizzle w olive oil n salt, both sides.
Cover w foil to seal.
Cook (steam) 10 mins.
foil off, 8-12 more mins.
flip, 8-12 mins more.
594 2018-03-21 22:38:56 Get yourself a bestfriend like @natamolina14 that will go with you on ladies day and save you $7 on an oil change for your car.
595 2018-03-21 22:38:52 Yes. It's amazing,isn't it, that a country smaller than New Jersey, with no natural resources, (like Arab oil) can't take care of everyone?
596 2018-03-21 22:38:50 I like that idea- integration oil - I may use that Damien! #IrishMed
597 2018-03-21 22:38:25 This stuff works beats steroid shots! My cat was chewing pulling fur off became allergic to fleas over load of chemicals was to no avail & making her sick. After we got skin under control all we needed occasionally was the oil however at first we used pills, oil & shampoo.
598 2018-03-21 22:38:20 Why is pep boys so damn slow changing my oil 
599 2018-03-21 22:38:09 The mac store lady was so cute but she said she uses coconut oil on her skin :///
600 2018-03-21 22:38:04 There is an accident on the puchong LDP towards putrajaya, involving a petronas oil tanker which has hit the road divider and presently stuck @ 45 degrees angle, just before UOB, HSBC Area.
601 2018-03-21 22:37:45 I'm not sure oil prices will take dodgy shale names higher this time. They couldn't make money when crude was at $100 before, and they likely won't be able to do so this time either as oil services prices rise once again.  Oil higher, shale on the mat the pain trade for everyone.
602 2018-03-21 22:37:28 I like cbd and i really do feel it helps me with some anxiety, but when I see shit that says like " TAKE CBD OIL TO CURE YOUR CANCER, PTSD, ASTHMA WITH JUST 2 DROPS PER DAY" I wonder wth I'm doing.
603 2018-03-21 22:37:19 Buy a nose balloon from chemist . It works!
Also facial steamer with olbas oil ...I can go on x
604 2018-03-21 22:37:00 but wouldn’t you get a lot of overpaid cocky sense of entitlement football players or oil sheikhs
605 2018-03-21 22:36:59 Why would Florida be off table for oil drilling? I'm planning on opening a fish taco restaurant in Galveston.

606 2018-03-21 22:36:56 #SaveSheffTrees is symbolic & has opened peoples eyes. If we cannot stop the destruction of a few street trees, how on Earth are we going to stop millions of trees and thousands of species being destroyed for palm oil.
 @Greenpeace please lend some support.
607 2018-03-21 22:36:38 I bet Mike and Mrs. Pence's sex smells like gun oil and an Oedipus complex.
608 2018-03-21 22:36:23 You're on another planet. All promises in 2104 kept and bullet dodged with oil price crash.
The EUref was a UK vote, 1 man 1 vote. It's simple really even for you.
609 2018-03-21 22:36:13 わかりみ
610 2018-03-21 22:35:57 If John Berger taught me to read oil paintings to understand the machinations of capitalism as well as the functions of the cis-gendered male gaze, it is our task to read oil and the machinations of settler-colonialism.
611 2018-03-21 22:35:51 Luego de la intervención judicial en Oil Combustibles , se viene la similar en OCA, por su abultada deuda fiscal?
612 2018-03-21 22:35:46 Came for an oil change...got told I need everything other than an oil change 
613 2018-03-21 22:35:45 A ritual worth considering: Piece of butter, shot of coconut oil, shot of apple cider vinegar, shot of olive oil and you finish with a bacon slice (or 3)
614 2018-03-21 22:35:36 Yes agreed. I run a fb page raising awareness for palm oil and promoting local SA produced seed oils. The SA farming community would benefit from marketing themselves within the consumer industry. The supply chain needs to be pulled 
615 2018-03-21 22:35:24 I think v v v big players incolved. Oil money etc
616 2018-03-21 22:35:13 Rate of extraction can't increase, no. But replacing exhausted oil wells needn't increase production, merely increase life of the industry

618 2018-03-21 22:35:06 If the folks out there want nuge...Well it's gonna be a damn sniper for mcdavid or it's gonna be a damn puck moving dman who can score. That's what the oil need. If its not happening well you're not getting nuge.

620 2018-03-21 22:34:39 Oil paper. Daler, Winsor and Newton, Arches all make oil paper in pads. It’s specially coated to take oil paint
621 2018-03-21 22:34:32 My mom brought CBD oil for anxiety. I never thought she would ever try that. It'll be interesting to see if it works.
622 2018-03-21 22:34:12 Educating congress is one thing, but I think we all have a responsibility to educate our friends and family (who are not in marketing) how they contribute to “data is the new oil” economy. Tonight I thought I better tell them what “lookalike targeting” is.
623 2018-03-21 22:34:04 Facial oil or Facial cream??
624 2018-03-21 22:33:54 There are people all over the world whose circumstances would cause them to look through the lens of their own experience and call his life privileged. So define 'privileged' in light of that.
625 2018-03-21 22:33:53 Susan if you want to be right then you are right. But you ignored an important question we all need to work to answer because you were hung up on the proper use of the word 'privileged'.
626 2018-03-21 22:33:50 I got Will the Shea Moisture beard wash and beard oil along with some facial scrub. I also keep his baldy fresh with Shea Moisture butter shave cream, Shea Moisture after shave, witch hazel and a nice coconut oil head massage
627 2018-03-21 22:33:49 So over all this snow! I’m ready to be laid out in the sun in my bikini covered in oil & tanning, but no... this snow wants to come out of the sky outta no where
628 2018-03-21 22:33:42 The thing is and I know it's unpopular...if the best you could do was a 3rd for maroon you should have just let him play and leave as a ufa and my thinking behind that is it sends the message to other gms that the oil are not gonna be dicked around this summer. Make a good offer
629 2018-03-21 22:33:32 Bio oil will help with the scaring babes xx amazing stuff x
630 2018-03-21 22:33:30 He should be suing oil and gas companies. They made all the profits and socialized the losses on all of us
631 2018-03-21 22:33:24 Time to spend some of the money you've been getting from oil, coal, etc. for years and repay the taxpayers.
632 2018-03-21 22:33:20 Do the Caster oil  or have hubby massage ur calves 
633 2018-03-21 22:33:08 So yeah if you think you gonna absorb supplements [Black seed oil, Huarnarpo, Black Maca, etc] without cleaning and healing that gut...it'll go right thru you

**Flushes toilet** 
gotta let that gut heal then you can hold on to the good stuff

635 2018-03-21 22:32:58 I’m thinking that rather than holding 98 back by not giving him “top 6” minutes, TM may in fact be pursuing an entirely different vision...

The three drivers in the top 9...

636 2018-03-21 22:32:52 it was all about the oil
637 2018-03-21 22:32:46 Beautiful first family! A wonderful 
picture, should be made into an
oil painting
638 2018-03-21 22:32:20 Please think about this: Sir Prince Harry, you are committing Adultery. And your marriage is going to be Adultery. I wish you could go to Isra-el before the wedding. And go to a Rabbi, and ask to be anointed with oil and prayed over, that if lust is on he will leave.
639 2018-03-21 22:32:04 Oof! Wash your mouth out! Not mink oil, you'll be pleased to know mate. Used bees wax, then the Polish that comes with Fracaps. Had a go at the crepe soles with a wire brush & some soap, too. Has all brought them up a treat. Really pleased.
640 2018-03-21 22:32:00 they don't taste as dry when I do that for some reason. After I drain the oil off em at least.
641 2018-03-21 22:31:52 Wouldn't coconut oil work better?
642 2018-03-21 22:31:48 Ohh thank you! I’ll have a look! I use bio oil at night to clear up scars and that but I want to change moisturiser so a gel might be better!

645 2018-03-21 22:30:59 Americans know you are ruining the environment for everyone to maximise the profits for big oil and gas owners.
646 2018-03-21 22:30:58 the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Refuse Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended.
647 2018-03-21 22:30:58 I caught the stiff arm for saying I wanna rub coconut oil on her buns? She don’t care about life ..
648 2018-03-21 22:30:54 I need someone to put oil in my hair
649 2018-03-21 22:30:49 coconut oil is basic,, use diesel fuel to take your makeup off instead
650 2018-03-21 22:30:43 HAHAHAHAH my car just started to pour smoke and what I believe is oil is all over the fucking place.
651 2018-03-21 22:30:27 But one was my essential oils order with the magic sleeping oil that keeps @swearyanthony sane so I think it was worth it.
652 2018-03-21 22:30:16 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
653 2018-03-21 22:30:13 RT @Tomcordero9: Stop covering up all the issues this is starting to cause. Be a man & man up to your mistakes. We are not sheep. We will vote u out in Nov you snake oil salesman
654 2018-03-21 22:30:04 OIL DIFF: 4.29 -> 4.47
655 2018-03-21 22:29:52 I don’t know exactly what it does but I think I need an oil diffuser. L ol
656 2018-03-21 22:29:37 an update bc you were all very concerned: face has been washed with new charcoal & tea trea oil soap and moisturized to within an inch of its life
657 2018-03-21 22:29:36 Nope Norway was clever as one of  the richest nations on earth 
#Oil 
Expensive though, we were Trondheim b4 Xmas and a pint  was £7 
But if your into winter sports 
658 2018-03-21 22:29:33 That was when a was rattling the oil
659 2018-03-21 22:29:27 OIL BRENT US$69.73/bbl +3.1%. Crude prices lift on US inventory falls of 2.6Mbbl (week on week), according to latest EIA report.
660 2018-03-21 22:29:09 Statoil is publicly listed and u are welcome to buy shares and receive dividends. And there are like 50 other E&P companies operating on the Norwegian shelf too. Norwegian oil industry is everything else but ”nationalised”. Stop with crazy comments.
661 2018-03-21 22:29:07 According the article I read from 2017 the DEA says specifically CBD oil is not legal in all 50 states. I didn’t do any further research into it though.
662 2018-03-21 22:29:04 oil is oil, just go on amazon and make sure its organic/cold pressed/raw
663 2018-03-21 22:29:03 Part 1 Congress should say no.  Pollution from oil, coal increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  IMF Externalities:  Prices Do Not Capture All Costs.
664 2018-03-21 22:28:59 I now get creative in the kitchen. I turned a can of albacore into a salad with goat cheese, arugula, grape seed oil, EVOO,  & 
665 2018-03-21 22:28:56 Officer: Sir, you were reported for child abuse. I am here to take you guns.

Sir: By who? And for what?

Officer: we received a call from A Mark Jr.

Sir: WTF? That's my son!

Officer: Yes he said "Mark Sr. Made me brush my teeth and take a shower."
666 2018-03-21 22:28:56 Had the best helper ever today while changing the brakes and oil in mommies car!!!  Love this little dude!!! — feeling proud

668 2018-03-21 22:28:45 Today was beautiful with @krombopulosbass, we ate at The Sanctum, bought CBD oil & inscents, I copped a chrome diopside ring, and got my helix pierced :”)
669 2018-03-21 22:28:44 Cleaned my apartment, got a car wash, and an oil change 
670 2018-03-21 22:28:40 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
671 2018-03-21 22:28:38 This article says " I’ll accept Krause’s argument that some—perhaps even most—of the money goes to fund groups fighting against the Alberta oil sands and the building of pipelines to tidewater, like Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion."
672 2018-03-21 22:28:16 병원가ㅠㅜ 뭘 잘못 먹은거야ㅠㅜ
673 2018-03-21 22:28:12 Started using my peppermint oil in my diffuser. My apartment smells like a candy cane. 
674 2018-03-21 22:27:49 These fuckin oil memes are class 
675 2018-03-21 22:27:45 hydrate or die-drate dawg.
676 2018-03-21 22:27:34 Osteen is a con man. A professional snake oil salesman. You know what’s worse? I’ll bet you everything I own that he knows it.
677 2018-03-21 22:27:32 Paper. Or maybe an air filter (or is it an oil filter?—I’m a reader who nurses, not a mechanic).
678 2018-03-21 22:27:24 And yes the oil goes to US refineries on those 2 lines.  Did you know part of the trans mountain expansion was already put in the ground some time ago during the PC run check it out.  As far as Notley goes I want my Carbon Tax money back. Social license it was supposed to buy us.
679 2018-03-21 22:27:19 Made it better how?

Attacking the 1st Amendment? Or
Golfing while collecting payment from treasury for HIS protection? Or
Lying daily? Or
Attacking our men in blue?
Selling off our National parks/monuments for big oil to destroy? Or
Rolling back civil rights? Or
Destroying water
680 2018-03-21 22:27:02 I’m actually pretty lazy with my hair now in comparison to how I used to be smh. I don’t really shampoo but I condition with Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner. Use tea tree, jojoba, rosemary, & peppermint oil & Talia Waajid’s detangling conditioner as a leave in, then blow it out
681 2018-03-21 22:26:55 Hardest task in the world is putting on cream,oil and taking a tan shot all in those 4 minutes before the sunbed lights up #notime #mission
682 2018-03-21 22:26:53 So glad you are out of surgery & home to recover. I was wondering how you were doing & I must admit to sending up a couple of prayers for you. I’m sure they didn’t travel alone. 
Check out SerraEnzyme, H2O2 & O3 therapy as well as cannabis oil.
Take care 
683 2018-03-21 22:26:48 Seconded, as the cracked pepper and olive oil ones are really nice
684 2018-03-21 22:26:43 It really depends on the person. Because I have been doing no carbs and I feel amazing. Your body stops burning carbs and starts burning fat which is why you need stuff like avocados, cheese and coconut oil.
685 2018-03-21 22:26:34 @JohnBrennan Yeah the man that is selling weapons to Ukraine and exporting American oil to cut down Russias primary source of income is somehow a "Russian agent"

lol get fucked you old fart

688 2018-03-21 22:26:17 Owns three homes, his wife bankrupted a college, and the screwball to his right in the video who also complains along with him about the cost of a college education, had no issue with pocketing 325K dollars to teach one class!
689 2018-03-21 22:26:01 Bring ‘em all home, Paul. They’re not fighting for anything but oil company greed, certainly not freedom. Bring them home!
690 2018-03-21 22:26:00 @politicalelle @SenSanders because insider trading is legal in federal gov

694 2018-03-21 22:25:36 yes China will try to sink the price of oil for their own benefit...remember they are the largest consumers..they hate oil over $60
695 2018-03-21 22:25:32 Oil change guy "your total is $546.54 will that be cash or card?"

700 2018-03-21 22:24:35 We just got some new *H3O HEALING HEARTS HEALTH OIL 600:300 CBD:THC*
701 2018-03-21 22:24:28 Had root canal twice last week. I feel your pain. Clove oil.
702 2018-03-21 22:24:28 The chicken and chips in intercol used to be fried in a special oil. 

I’m feeling for it now 
703 2018-03-21 22:24:28 Lol I want to be the 1st to rubb them with baby oil lol
704 2018-03-21 22:24:18 Feel like this oil meme is gunna take off lol
705 2018-03-21 22:24:14 Do we dare ?! The only business we have been able to export successfully &  truly compete in West Africa that I know of is our banks. Even that was sustained by the oil boom as most are closing their operations. Diamond Bank in point.
706 2018-03-21 22:23:48 So you're effectively saying if the contract is a success, the gold/oil ratio will blow out.  Interesting.

711 2018-03-21 22:22:35 Has the campaign linked in with keep billy alive campaign run by Charlotte Caldwell from Castlederg? I think billy is taking the cannabis oil
712 2018-03-21 22:22:32 The degree to which Cappy has been brainwashed into believing that Trump is good for America makes me see how people allowed Hitler to come to power.  People will believe anything!  If I didn't have a moral compass, I would start selling magic snake oil at Trump rallies.
713 2018-03-21 22:22:26 short oil across any exchange that you can ..period ..don't care if its traded in Kiribati dollars...short it
714 2018-03-21 22:22:22 They could call them Ethical Oil
715 2018-03-21 22:22:08 honey, coconut oil breaks out your skin even more
716 2018-03-21 22:22:08 So tell me why I had oil dripping on my face from my hair today and nobody told me. People in Tallhasee aint shit. 
717 2018-03-21 22:22:01 Fastest oil changed I’ve ever had omg
718 2018-03-21 22:21:39 I got this hair food oil & i fucking LOVE it & its cheap 
719 2018-03-21 22:21:35 Bud & Oil Burners.
720 2018-03-21 22:21:34 I got some nice olive oil today and had great plans for it, until it just decides to FALL OUT OF MY BAG AND BUST ON THE PAVEMENT. That's why you don't buy nice stuff.
721 2018-03-21 22:21:24 Thank you Kirsty. Even the leanest of Charities need a little 'oil' to keep the wheels turning. Lots of small charities run entirely on volunteers. But you are right, it is the mentality that needs to change.
722 2018-03-21 22:21:07 Because of his dedication he deserves multiple homes in which to get away from the dirty masses, I mean proletariat, in order to recharge his batteries so he can continue to rule, I mean govern.  It is extremely difficult running everyone's live for them so he deserves them.
723 2018-03-21 22:21:04 Yes! I toss them with a little olive oil (less than a tablespoon) and that's all they need.
724 2018-03-21 22:20:59 Again the real question is how someone in America, a free nation with opportunity all around can be radicalized. I think if we ignore that question to attack one another on how privileged we consider him to be we will never solve anything.

727 2018-03-21 22:20:20 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.
728 2018-03-21 22:20:19 Snake oil is superb and a throw back @embrace anthem
729 2018-03-21 22:20:19 And the price of oil is skyrocketing.
730 2018-03-21 22:20:16 @eugenegu How did graduate medical School with that kind of logic. FaceBook is a private service and membership is completely voluntary (terms of service). The First Amendment doesn’t apply. Stop using it. Delete your account. Delete your Twitter account, too.

734 2018-03-21 22:19:45 You know it's a good day when you and a friend can discuss the alien franchise and it's fascinating similarities on how Weyland-Yutani is like big oil
735 2018-03-21 22:19:40 Why?  And short oil in what - CNY or USD?
736 2018-03-21 22:19:38 hahaha brilliant mate - that wee critter gets smelly oil poured over his head for some reason!
737 2018-03-21 22:19:22 Exactly. Why some of these bears crack me up “death of oil is coming” ....sure, maybe, but without a timeframe that info is useless. It might happen in 50 years and you’re technically right but it’s not profitable info.
738 2018-03-21 22:19:17 Luke: Just get the answer to this question: how many times in its 80-year history as an oil exporter, Saudi Arabia used spot market or futures for its oil?
739 2018-03-21 22:19:08 That tough love and yellow oil baby  wooh!!!
740 2018-03-21 22:18:54 I've heard rumblings of Chinese refinery jv's having right of 1st refusal on oil exporter jv partner's physical allocations - u ever hear anything like that?  IOW, if China has 50/50 refinery jv w/Saudi, China gets 50% & has right of 1st refusal on other 50% (hypothetically)
741 2018-03-21 22:18:35 “I don’t understand that people have to drive to get to places and can also think that oil and gas companies are corrupt and destroying the country”. Y’all are idiots.

744 2018-03-21 22:18:10 @msnbc Not too long ago WALL ST. TRAITORS flexed their GREEDY MUSCLES taking markets down 1000's of pts. per days to prove their power. That affected 50 % of Americans who are invested in the markets. Now the CCM is taking gas/heating oil attacking the bottom 50%? SAD!
745 2018-03-21 22:18:06 Y'know... I know the US is a shithole. And I should be laughing at the oil memes. But I can't. For me they're just a constant reminder of how bad this place is and why people hate us.

762 2018-03-21 22:16:47 Oil is a dinosaur...
763 2018-03-21 22:16:39 I might try the combo without the oil or a different oil, I'll do some research! Jzk.
764 2018-03-21 22:16:35 Albania can offer tomorrow to buy oil in world markets in Albanian Lek, nobody will take the offer.

There is nothing practically stopping anybody to store CNY at any amount and not just by selling oil, anything.

766 2018-03-21 22:16:02 If you own the refinery you determine the buyer. Ie China gets the oil when there is a shortage and Indian keeps snoozing.

769 2018-03-21 22:15:54 Another example is the financial burden placed on solar energy. Trump  wants to go back to oil and gas. America is a leader in solar. Trump  wants to import coal from Russia when solar is probing healthier, less costly and is steadily creating more jobs.
770 2018-03-21 22:15:46 Mine are coming in!! CBD oil got rid of the pain and has prevented infection!!!
771 2018-03-21 22:15:45 Serious question I'm wrestling with based on analysis I'm doing:  Consensus is that CNY contract is a flop.  What happens if 10-20% of global physical volume moves there by YE 2018?  What if more?  Do USD oil prices rise?  Do they fall?  Thx in advance for any thoughts.
772 2018-03-21 22:15:43 I hope that isn't mink oil mate? Could lead to anything on here even mentioning it, let alone using it!!

774 2018-03-21 22:15:35 We have an oil pipeline that crosses the entirety of Alaska, yet nobody can figure out how to get water to a city that's an hour's drive from the largest system of freshwater lakes in the world. Unbelievable.
775 2018-03-21 22:15:29 On a purely antipodean angle I’d also throw...Beds are burning (Midnight Oil), Original Sin (INXS) and Into Temptation (Crowed House) into the mix.

776 2018-03-21 22:15:29 @maddow Is there collision between N. Korea & Russia against USA that Trump would not suspect.  We know Russia provides oil to NK.  Whose to say they won't trap trump into something.  Is it possible?

You don't know when a thief comes = which means you don't know God's Plan, the seals, trumpets, vials or His Word. 
Which means you are spiritual dead to God's word, you do not have the seal of God in your forehead/not enough oil in your lamp.

842 2018-03-21 22:09:32 Not so certain the oil company info is correct. Koch pipelines transport petroleum for ConocoPhillips. Chevron owns Unocal, and has been merged with Texaco.
The paper product information is spot on.

844 2018-03-21 22:09:25 No problem!! I’ve been there w/burning the midnight oil to finish big ass drawings for school you gotta take care of yrself
845 2018-03-21 22:09:23 I just massaged cleansing oil into my face and then careful ruffled the leftover into my (formally) clean hair. Goddammit. It is bedtime.
846 2018-03-21 22:09:21 Given that it’s clear that people can’t act ethically in Commercial Cyberspace with #DeleteFacebook, #CambridgeAnalytica and #Google - isn’t it time we had some regulation @JenniferSertl ? Worked (kinda) with the Oil industry a century ago…
847 2018-03-21 22:09:10 omg yes. the natural history museum had a STEM event for girls and there were two oil and gas companies and RAYTHEON. come build bombs, girls!
848 2018-03-21 22:09:08 #TheBeat Zuckerberg's "to be honest..."  remind you of anyone? Snake oil salesmen are all alike ...  "believe me"
849 2018-03-21 22:09:06 Massage coconut oil into your scalp, you can apply to the rest of your hair, cover with shower cap/cling film or bag, leave for 3 hrs, then wash out with your shampoo. Once or twice a wk, Coconut oil will also strengthen your hair and help with growth
850 2018-03-21 22:08:36 But @elonmusk  isn't there potential for space money or your plan wouldn't work. Maybe it'll be easier to mine cobalt in asteroids. Hell dubai is only sand, oil and water now it's a tourist hot spot.

853 2018-03-21 22:08:17 find oil, give all the money to the treasury and our children continue to starve, ah but it's for the glorious union...
854 2018-03-21 22:08:01 We had sprouted whole wheat chocolate chip cookies made with coconut oil.  It was depressing.
855 2018-03-21 22:07:56 take a while for your skin to get used to not getting dried out by soaps etc and used to the oil so you may break out at first (which I did as well). And also o repeat myself cocnut oil isnt for everyone but it's like with all skincare - trial and error.
856 2018-03-21 22:07:53 Wait..what.  Cambridge secret tape states companies will give huge donations to campaigns in exchange for land.  Does he mean the  federal land that trump said he would sell to the oil companies?
857 2018-03-21 22:07:51 Okay, no oil painting
858 2018-03-21 22:07:41 the whole state of california smells like tea tree oil rn
859 2018-03-21 22:07:33 It’s like when you try to do right by your car it gives you problems. For Example I went got an oil change a day later the engine and oil light came on

861 2018-03-21 22:07:20 A3: Data is the new oil.

863 2018-03-21 22:07:01 It takes time for everything to come together but industrialization and self sufficiency are non negotiable. We are an importer nation that imports everything & that's why we have all these problems of militancy, crime& poor services. + Naira devaluation when oil prices go down.
864 2018-03-21 22:06:59 What’s wrong with drilling for oil?
865 2018-03-21 22:06:43 So basically it's the oil cleaning method. It's easy and cheap (in the long run) and once you find what works for you - the best ever! I would suggest starting with coconut oil bc it's easy to come by and lasts a long time. One important thing to remeber though is that it can
866 2018-03-21 22:06:42 This is a swamp, with a methane bubble, with an oil slick, with a carelessly discarded cigarette butt. This is a trumpster fire. This is a week-long party at Woody Creek. Even @realdonaldtrump will see how weird this could get.

871 2018-03-21 22:06:02 I struggled with this too! A coworker recommended adding a small spoonful of coconut oil and cinnamon. It definitely made the taste more bearable but definitely not as good as cream and sugar 
872 2018-03-21 22:05:56 Masturbaiting is better when you put oil on your dick.
873 2018-03-21 22:05:52 Ya wcw hasn’t gotten an oil change in a year and half....she doesn’t even look under the hood of her car occasionally
874 2018-03-21 22:05:44 $300 for an oil change. wild. and don’t let anything else break, it’s a wrap.
875 2018-03-21 22:05:39 Please stop calling my oil diffuser a vape

882 2018-03-21 22:05:05 I have a communal rural box now in central location not door to door. When I lived D2D I cleared path for #postal #oil #energy #utility paths because I remember wading in waist deep snow for an outside job at one time plus if there was ever a fire!
883 2018-03-21 22:05:02 have you ever eaten at a paleo restaurant? after eating my leaves + sweet potato + chicken w lemon and olive oil I went home and made the same thing with the usuals from my fridge + a lot more seasoning
884 2018-03-21 22:04:58 Or just stink in general, be in your personal space smelling like newports and burnt oil 
885 2018-03-21 22:04:58 btw noko is a nuclear problem because of bill clinton paying them in the oil for food program. So thank POTIS for being strong

888 2018-03-21 22:04:37 Thank you for sharing! I just started following them! 
889 2018-03-21 22:04:26 What about these run a way oil prices creeping back up? Come on we're producing more oil today than ever and what about tracking. Come on Pres help us out that 1000.00 bonus is already eaten up in fuel stop the crap
890 2018-03-21 22:04:25 Putting on Tooth paste before showers helps open pores and freeze the breakout
Apple Cider Vinegar Clears and Cleans it

891 2018-03-21 22:04:12 And if oil prices aren’t $80 by the election will you admit you were wrong or do you already have an excuse ready?
892 2018-03-21 22:03:53 Why are we having war for oil? If we would have had that electric car when Jimmy was in they would be way better cars no oil no war
893 2018-03-21 22:03:53 Deuterium high grade oil is found in the Philippines making it the world richest country in the world. Asides from it, Philippines is rich in natural resources and other oils.
894 2018-03-21 22:03:40 So sorry. He’s been hoodwinked. I hope he’s reading real news of late. 50M users - sold to a Russian “oil” co. Data still unaccounted for. I call it criminal.
895 2018-03-21 22:03:31 Don't know which ones will make them go away but ROSEMARY essential oil can help you remember to pay them. 
896 2018-03-21 22:03:18 If you have lavender or chamomile essential oil, rubbing a drop or two on the back of the neck, or diffusing them in your room can be a game changer!

900 2018-03-21 22:02:52 you don't need to add oil. At least not to almonds. I make my own almond butter and use nothing than roasted almonds (I buy them w/o the skin tho) salt and if you like any other flavor. If you blend them long enough they get oily on their own.
901 2018-03-21 22:02:52 that is true, but right now Canada is supplying the electric  power in the northern parts of the US , and most of your Oil uranium gold  that is what Canada exports
902 2018-03-21 22:02:44 I've seen something totally appalling tonight on the news : Chinese ppl have grown a sudden evil passion for #horserace and betting.. 1000's go to the race tracks every day and the winner goes home with....a bottle of salad oil!!!

906 2018-03-21 22:02:28 Okay, so U.S. presidents of both parties, foreign intelligence, and even the NYT all agree Saddam was going nuclear and soon.  So the question was, amidst the corrupt and collapsing oil-for-food program, should we just go ahead and let Saddam Hussein have nuclear weapons?
907 2018-03-21 22:02:27 sorry, to clarify, hrc is a war hawk. she is perfectly fine for overthrowing and destablizing govts/countries. i knew by voting for hillary i would be supporting wars (as well a fracking big pharma, wall st, big oil and so on) i refuse to ever vote for a prowar or fracking cand.

913 2018-03-21 22:02:03 @iEarlGreyTV So, in the few months I've come back to WoWS I've learned:
1) Toxic internet tuff guys abound, some of the most toxic have been really good players.
2) Turn off voiceover msgs and horns
3) Some clan has missed a ton of oil from me / noob stats, not accepted
914 2018-03-21 22:01:59 A trader, like buffalo pelts or olive oil? Matter of fact ... I would like to order some salad dressing if you have some in stock.

916 2018-03-21 22:01:46 Sure let's go to nuclear war over BS. You naive beyond belief white liberals are playing with fire. Tomorrow Russia could start shipping oil to North Korea, place nuke missiles in Cuba, Venezuela. Veto Every UN Security Council Measure. A second cold war costing $ trillions.
917 2018-03-21 22:01:36 Aloe Vera, bio oil, anything with vitamin e
918 2018-03-21 22:01:34 How about we cut federal and provincial subsidies on oil & gas AND cut the carbon tax. We'll call it a net win for consumers, a net loss for for-profit companies. It will also make people pay the actual value for oil-based products.
919 2018-03-21 22:01:27 ... first Boracay, now your Oil and Gas...... THAT is the payback for having made a contract with the Chinese .... you better learn to bow to your new masters.....

925 2018-03-21 22:01:16 100% we are all just doing the best we can!

As for $USD, since late 1990s early 2000s, rallies in the greenback have been negative for global equities & oil. Same can be said about US equities. This still very much seems to be the case today.  It certainly was between 2014-16.
926 2018-03-21 22:01:15 The oil quickly catches and sets you on fire!! There is no way to put the fire out once it starts. You will be burned to the bone!!
927 2018-03-21 22:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but federal law enforcement.

929 2018-03-21 22:00:56 The #Oil industry today-extremely stressed? Yes. Many independents may go out-but also may be an opportunity for #investors.
930 2018-03-21 22:00:51 This is a good idea. 

But also, chop up a sweet potato + any other veg you like (or even an apple, like I just did). Put them in a pan with butter and olive oil. Season with chipotle chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper. Cook til brown. Top with egg. Devour.

952 2018-03-21 21:58:20 @spud01au the point is that recycled tyre oil as a diesel additive could provide a solution to the global stockpiling of 1.5 billion tonnes of used tyres each year. We discard 55 million tyres in Australia annually!
953 2018-03-21 21:58:14 U see cos of our aviation oil ooooooo
954 2018-03-21 21:58:03 You say this and yet your province still consumes oil and natural gas, just via truck and train transport. Pipelines are a better alternative. 

On a side note, if BC cares so much about keeping their water clean, maybe they should stop pumping sewage into it.
955 2018-03-21 21:57:45 Just wondering who the rich oil billionaire is.

Yesterday, while meeting with Saudi +opining ‘IPutin’, you missed the young prince ... cuz he hates Iran and IranRussia.

Also, Saudi’s not using the uranium 4 power... they have oil.

968 2018-03-21 21:55:28 Might as well catch them all. Then when the oil rigs with loosened regulations blow out billions of barrels at least there won’t be any fish to be killed.

971 2018-03-21 21:55:16 What the hell are you talking about?  We're sending weapons to the Ukraine, undermining the high oil prices that they live on, and that's just to begin with.

975 2018-03-21 21:54:30 O&G didn't pay those wages because there was a lack of workers. Anyone can be an unskilled labourer. They paid them to get their jobs done faster because oil was $120 a barrel and they wanted to capitalize their profits.  But non O&G workers still need to live 1/2

980 2018-03-21 21:53:58 Mercola banned me from commenting on his articles because he'd write about something being superior to another supplement (Fish Oil vs. Krill Oil) then have a link to the product he was writing about. I called Dr. Erich Berg on that same bullshit, too.

How will Nigeria stay for 16years of oil boom without infrastructure & now that we are seeing signs of it, we are now faced with man made insecurity
983 2018-03-21 21:53:32 What does "full semi auto" even mean? Asking for a friend.
984 2018-03-21 21:53:14 He go waste ihn oil
985 2018-03-21 21:52:45 In fact, weren't the UK government paying the oil companies to take it away for us last year? Like a house clearance company? That will be another bonus for England when we take it away for free.
986 2018-03-21 21:52:22 Don’t be daft. We were explicitly told in 2014 that there was no oil remaining, what was left was too expensive to extract and oil prices would continue to fall.
987 2018-03-21 21:51:57 awww, hope you feel better oil!
988 2018-03-21 21:51:57 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective

990 2018-03-21 21:51:31 I can't believe Utah didn't start legislation to make this a state park or something on those lines. With that said it doesn't help here in Ohio. Gas and oil drill and pipe wherever they want.

1001 2018-03-21 21:50:11 IQ45, the only reason you love Putin more than your own country is because you owe Russia half a billion $, and Putin is using you in an attempt to compete in the global oil market. Also, you wish you had the “smarts” of either President Bush. Prove me wrong, show us your taxes.

And if these “proxies” exist do they want Free Trade.

1048 2018-03-21 21:45:38 Alternatively we could *not* act now, and let millions of people die at the hands of the private armies of Petrochemical companies in oil producing regions and quietly forget that there are consequences to inaction as there may be consequences to action.

1057 2018-03-21 21:44:17 Your point is good. But not going for the occasional training by healthcare professionals would be analogous to not servicing car with engine oil, repairs etc to avoid wasting time and money.

 Oil.. Rosneft
1120 2018-03-21 21:36:24 tea tree oil has worked so good on my face besides that day I used it right after a sheet mask though so idk :/
1121 2018-03-21 21:36:20 Nationalizing oil and redistribution of land are steps that have historically provoked swift and decisive action from the American Empire (CIA) whenever they have been initiated.
1122 2018-03-21 21:36:05 Mueller shoveled my driveway, changed oil on my car, cut 5 chords of firewood, made 17 snowmen, read the Harry Potter series of books and the Bible and arrived at work on time. #DBag
1123 2018-03-21 21:36:02 U can add some cbd oil to the engine.
1124 2018-03-21 21:36:00 honey turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, salt n pepper, dash vinegar+olive oil on a roll, cold
1125 2018-03-21 21:35:50 Tea tree oil or peppermint oil for when I’ve dissociated :)
1126 2018-03-21 21:35:39 Oh, also as a side tip: my recipe takes the meat once it's done simmering/shredding, and lays it on a baking sheet (line it with foil), drizzle with 2 tbsp of cooking oil, and roast it in the oven for 10 minutes at 375. It crisps the tips of the shred and gives 1/2
1127 2018-03-21 21:35:34 Oil is a huge cost and also Russias best weapon. Arabia runs out soon so they have hold future power. US has to continue to find ways of making wars and finding enemies. The UK wants some of that action
1128 2018-03-21 21:35:09 For split ends: mix 1 egg yolk w/ 3 Tbs olive oil and 1 Tbs honey. Apply to ends 1 hour before washing every 2 weeks. #LongHair #Delaware #DelawareHair #VirginHairObsession
1129 2018-03-21 21:35:08 Could be worse, try jumping in you van starting it up and having it run on its own oil and kill itself on the spot!Mine did just that last night, smoked the best part of Oldham out and now needs a complete new engine. No offence but I’d swap being p’eed off at a top box any day
1130 2018-03-21 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this March? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
1131 2018-03-21 21:35:04 Smart people don't get up on stage with snake oil salesmen. All the intelligent viewers wouldn't even see your interview if it were on #FakeNewsCNN
1132 2018-03-21 21:34:55 Example(s) of Coconut Oil based foods Sir?
1133 2018-03-21 21:34:43 Currently this wack ass oil slick. 
1134 2018-03-21 21:34:21 An oil leak? Impossible!
1135 2018-03-21 21:34:11 The face oil is so great
1136 2018-03-21 21:34:07 Here is an Irony: 
As oil prices rise, the world is enjoying a relatively cheaper gasoline because of OPEC production cut!
1137 2018-03-21 21:33:17 Lmao. Has to do with drilling for oil and gas

1139 2018-03-21 21:32:47 The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by Iraqi military forces setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 oil wells along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire trenches, as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991.
1140 2018-03-21 21:32:34 things arent working out so well for lying libs
1141 2018-03-21 21:32:32 Being raped by who? The best they are sending?
1142 2018-03-21 21:32:27 What is the current daily crude oil/gas production? And what is the price of oil/gas?
1143 2018-03-21 21:32:18 I thought we weren't allowed to be clear anymore? More like a grey or neutral I thought?
1144 2018-03-21 21:31:49 Has had an oil leak since January, but the thought of grovelling on the floor to sort it hasn't appealed...
1145 2018-03-21 21:31:47 That's what happens when you say it isn't backed by oil.
1146 2018-03-21 21:31:43 yeah swamps them gallons of sunflower oil son, Your cousin is a whale nothing to be proud off you glass eyed hippie

1149 2018-03-21 21:30:33 Getting my oil changed on my lunch was obviously a bad call. I’ve been here almost an hour and you can tell they hate their job. 
1150 2018-03-21 21:30:32 He goal is to marry oil
1151 2018-03-21 21:30:27 OIL DIFF: 4.35 -> 4.43
1152 2018-03-21 21:30:19 I don't think I'll ever save a buck and change my own oil 
1153 2018-03-21 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1154 2018-03-21 21:30:09 Oil on body. 
TFW women don't even want an ayurvedic oil massage from me, with aromatherapy, incense and awesome music...
1155 2018-03-21 21:30:04 Not to mention the damage that’s being done under the radar, like turning over pristine nat’l lands to oil speculators and allowing Dow to sell chemicals that were previously banned because they’re known carcinogenics . So much for draining the swamp!!
1156 2018-03-21 21:30:03 Oil goes beyond energy. We don't live on Gilligan's Island where we can function without plastics.  There will be a transition period to a petroleum free existence even if cars and trucks go the was of the ox-cart and carriage.

Happy car-spring-clean day! 
1161 2018-03-21 21:29:08 WOW - You mean it's like changing the oil in our cars? Yeah - to avoid engine failure!  .... A Ureka moment in Health Care, which until now would be better named "Treatment Care"...having little to do with disease avoidance and the true care for one's Health.
1162 2018-03-21 21:28:58 I did the coconut oil all the way until 8 months cause I ran out and I itched around my belly button cause it was soooo itchy and thats where my stretch marks are 
1163 2018-03-21 21:28:51 I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but Coal -> Oil -> Nuclear -> Lithium
1164 2018-03-21 21:28:41 Really look on price oil or gas do not mean shit. Trump is bullshiter nothing else.
1165 2018-03-21 21:28:34 I’m gonna @ u about the oil on the ground one that’s all I have to say
1166 2018-03-21 21:28:31 Tea Tree Oil is really blessing my life rn
1167 2018-03-21 21:28:24 Tea Tree oil made me a believer in essential oils.
1168 2018-03-21 21:28:22 not only Ukraine but Venezuela oil and Middle East oil. They are so helpful.
1169 2018-03-21 21:28:20 Guess he was right. Chicks dig murderers and brothers of murderers.

1171 2018-03-21 21:28:15 coconut oil goes through all the skin, when most steroid creams and non organic oil goes through only some of the layers of dermis i highly recommend organic coconut oil 
1172 2018-03-21 21:28:01 I took my car in for an oil change.. my back seat is COVERED in musical theatre anthologies. 
1173 2018-03-21 21:28:00 Well fuel for SUVs doesn’t have to come out of wells or you know, oil and gas companies could try to contain spills...Exxon Valdez, Deepwater Horizon, and you know not stick pipes across Reservations like Standing Rock...
1174 2018-03-21 21:27:44 Casually applying olive oil to my hair 
1175 2018-03-21 21:27:42 If you’re oily Laura Mercier has an oil free tinted moisturizer also!
1176 2018-03-21 21:27:37 Yeah but why coconut oil?
1177 2018-03-21 21:27:32 My MD (who is also a sleep therapy specialist) offers a very contrary view of your product. "Rip-off," "waste of money," "doesn't clean anything," "uses ozone which only sanitizes." Sorry, #SoClean, you're selling snake oil.  I've used a CPAP for 20 years. Never got sick. Ever.
1178 2018-03-21 21:27:30 Whoever stole my vitamin e oil that I kept in the bathroom ya moms a hoe
1179 2018-03-21 21:27:22 Noticed the direct correlation between 'popping skin' and groundnut oil and I just might tap into it.
1180 2018-03-21 21:27:21 Never even hear about China and couple dozen oil corporations operating on Iraq's massive conventional oil fields, Halliburton ExXon mobile Chevron BP, etc.etc.etc the real reason for the invasion was $10 pb oil blowing 300 feet in the air
1181 2018-03-21 21:27:18 Facebook didn't know that what was praised for Obama 2012 would be reviled for Trump 2016?  Let the Two Minutes Hate begin.
1182 2018-03-21 21:27:18 Oil, Gas, Gold, Platinum, Uranium and other valuable minerals.
1183 2018-03-21 21:27:12 Coconut oil maybe ?
1184 2018-03-21 21:27:11 Make sure your name doesn't spell oil

or else the U.S army will be knocking on your door
1185 2018-03-21 21:26:53 Thank you kind Sir
1186 2018-03-21 21:26:50 Hi. Rachel Holmes. Greetings! Life's Great! Food is being made tasety with oki oil , balance with five colours (black, green, red, yellow and white) , with thermal equilibrium in the ecosystem and drink with less sugar content. Craving for sugar being maintain with fruits intake.
1187 2018-03-21 21:26:43 Do not mean shit price oil and gas are same for consumers is only good for gas and oil companies.
1188 2018-03-21 21:26:41 Oil change and tire change for my baby Troy after that long trip  but my wallet is hurting now 
1189 2018-03-21 21:26:40 It is for oil of course-shamful
1190 2018-03-21 21:26:24 I hope they find an oil field that can only be accessed by demolishing A.B. Medley's house.

1202 2018-03-21 21:24:54 furiously applying my essential oil destress roller while walking while late to something has been a big 2018 mood #sueme
1203 2018-03-21 21:24:51 I take oregano oil (natural antiviral) a cple of drops in water.  And I do a bit of a lymph drain massage, hoping it helps. And sleep as much of possible
1204 2018-03-21 21:24:46 Ugh. We are trying to build our emergency savings but life is clearly against us

1205 2018-03-21 21:24:45 You can buy CBD oil in H&B - Alfie needs a full spectrum oil with THC which is ILLEGAL sadly :(
1206 2018-03-21 21:24:41 Get some yellow corn tortillas flash fry your own in peanut oil. Tastes amazing! You can even get stainless steel racks to help shape them. Check YouTube.
1207 2018-03-21 21:24:35 Applying balm/oil to your head and accidentally rubbing/touching your eyes.

1209 2018-03-21 21:24:09 Lifschitz está contento con YPF porque parece que van a solucionar lo de la refinería de Oil en San Lorenzo, @mxahumada. Mientras el arreglo no sea como los de Sancor, Vasalli o Mefro Wheels
1210 2018-03-21 21:24:00 Genie oil have a lot to answer for.... follow the money (oil). I bet it all leads back to wannabe Tories doing the bidding if murdoch/cheny
1211 2018-03-21 21:23:56 Yes, that is definitely the danger with fish oil tablets, but since I am not sure I can get enough just from the fish and nuts, I looked into good sources. One I found that seems to be well-regarded is Viva Naturals.  But, yes, more fish is optimal!
1212 2018-03-21 21:23:46 Listening to a 17 yr old me regarding gov policy, foolish.  Why anyone gives this kid the time of day is beyond me.
1213 2018-03-21 21:23:29 When all the oil in the world is gone, sometime in the future, the US government will be the ones to invent time travel, so they can go back in the past for more. I'm sure of it. We'll also think they're aliens.
1214 2018-03-21 21:23:28 Of course I do, and so does America. What do you really think Putin’s problem is, the balance of power via oil? No, that isn’t his problem, do you know what it is?  As for NATO, Trump has picked his side
1215 2018-03-21 21:23:21 Haha and they are wondering why the world needs an oil contract in yuan.
1216 2018-03-21 21:22:44 Oregano Oil at any health food store will get rid of any illness within 24 hours.
1217 2018-03-21 21:22:38 @NutellaUSA Please stop using palm oil, linked to major issues deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change, animal cruelty and indigenous rights abuses in the countries where it is produced! There should be ethics and trust, and now I see none in you. Please stop!
1218 2018-03-21 21:22:36 Huh.  Its not covered in crude oil for some reason.

1243 2018-03-21 21:19:39 tbh it can be a lazy crutch at times. I pitched oil-pulling once as "taking the oil pill." (in my defense I was 3 sheets to the wind)
1244 2018-03-21 21:19:32 In the mean time the Chinese taking all the gold the Russians the oil .. and in Venezuela the people starving . America  need to get together vans take this criminals out power @marcorubio
1245 2018-03-21 21:19:29 up the protein content in your food that should fill you up while allowing you to eat at a calorie defict. llike i'll eat no carbs and shallow fry 6 chicken wings in cocunut oil
1246 2018-03-21 21:19:28 A really good Aussie book to compliment @TuckerGoodrich interview is @gillespi 's Toxic Oil. Between those 2, I am terrified of seed oils, and so should we all be!
1247 2018-03-21 21:19:19 It's no wonder no real problem solving ever gets done.
1248 2018-03-21 21:19:10 OIL
1249 2018-03-21 21:19:08 Sounds like they handed out the DVD in the theatre.
1250 2018-03-21 21:19:04 American oil memes are the thing I didn’t think I needed in my life but I’m glad they appeared
1251 2018-03-21 21:19:00 Someone hook me up with some oil cartridges!! Ima need them to smoke in the house from now on
1252 2018-03-21 21:18:59 Nothing will ever smell as good as cooking garlic in oil. Do they sell this perfume?
1253 2018-03-21 21:18:48 I'm sure it does. I was just there a month or two ago, and some friends from Germany we're complaining about how filthy the city is.
1254 2018-03-21 21:18:45 Gives me a headache. Though I do have Jasmine essential oil, I remember to put on once or twice a year.

1256 2018-03-21 21:18:24 So what you are saying is we cannot call out Palm Oil production, or Mica, etc, as we are consumers. That is some broken logic you have going there.

1292 2018-03-21 21:13:53 Of course the focus is never on the important questions at hand but on whether someone was incorrectly labeled as privileged. Let's just say that compared to 90%of the world's population he was privileged instead of whether he had everything his neighbor did.

1339 2018-03-21 21:09:19 land, people, oil, minerals, are the usual suspects

1399 2018-03-21 21:01:57 DAY 36:  Many of us have been thinking about our toothpaste over the course of  this Lent as standard tubes are plastic and not recyclable. What  alternatives have you discovered? Could you even make your own (easily  done with coconut oil, bicarb and peppermint oil)?
1400 2018-03-21 21:01:00 LAST RT THE OIL MEMES IN THE REPLY I CANTTT
1401 2018-03-21 21:00:51 Venezuela went on a borrowing spree of huge proportions and imported most of its needs all based on its oil then the market for oil collapsed and it couldn't afford to make its repayments, something along those lines
1402 2018-03-21 21:00:45 Looks like maggots 
1403 2018-03-21 21:00:42 The Crown is lucky we havnt discovered oil in the UK. #freedankula #GodDamnTheQueen
1404 2018-03-21 21:00:36 My manager asked me if I've ever used coconut oil on my hair... I politely replied "Well of course, just one of the many oils that black women & men use on our hair for ages now"..
1405 2018-03-21 21:00:34 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this March? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
1406 2018-03-21 21:00:28 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1407 2018-03-21 21:00:22 Ive used creme of nature for a bit and it worked but then my hair adapted to it and now it does not work but ill try it again with the tea tree oil
1408 2018-03-21 21:00:22 Ran out of Omega 3 fish oil today so I decided to substitute it by collecting the oil from my Shake Shake burger and sluicing it into my mouth to lube my joints and brain
1409 2018-03-21 21:00:06 March 21, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1410 2018-03-21 20:59:37 Theres some places on web it is expensive, but i was offered honey oil 30 bar a vile a few weeks back , but i dont like vaping. For me, get some waste "product" stuff thats thrown & 99% Alcohol which acts as solvent. Heat it slow over pan , in non stick FP, get oil that way CBD
1411 2018-03-21 20:59:37 Yes. So for example: When oil executives lobby Trump, pressing for exemptions from his steel tariffs, that (to me) would be a specific official act. 

But when a "bribe" is paid to someone with no authority, himself, to take an official act, eg a POTUS adviser? That seems cloudy.
1412 2018-03-21 20:59:36 Increased traction in oil from the Drive. The Drive will offer you coverage when the Timeless is not quite enough ball. Fresher conditions of higher volume conditions is where the Drive Thrives!

1424 2018-03-21 20:58:08 Oil prices end near 7-week high on surprise declines in U.S. crude supplies
1425 2018-03-21 20:57:49 listen though. i have the oiliest, ugliest skin and use a highlighter to obfuscate the oil. because this shine is DELIBERATE

1437 2018-03-21 20:56:44 Caleb said if I pay for my own nails he will get my oil changed for me 
1438 2018-03-21 20:56:20 Yet LNP seems poised to introduce it. That slick snake oil salesman Turn-Bullshit and his henchmen are wheeling and dealing with the crossbenchers and are close to getting the numbers they need.
1439 2018-03-21 20:56:16 Domino's like the Oil, is toxic.
1440 2018-03-21 20:56:07 Thank you to Mr Bruce for sharing about work on an oil rig with P3 today.

1443 2018-03-21 20:55:53 Why did No one help or step in, what is happening to the human race  #OneLove 
1444 2018-03-21 20:55:42 No, Donald, they cannot.  Russia has a different agenda since the 1950's.  You are being played.  Putin wants his Soviet Union back along with western European ports and middle eastern oil.  You are a distraction while he makes his moves.  That you don't see this is problematic.
1445 2018-03-21 20:55:42 How much oil did Arnold slather on his skin when he was modelling? He wants to sue "Oil Giants", but he bathed in it. Maybe he should grease his brain so IT will look bigger.
1446 2018-03-21 20:55:41 @jeffkatzshow  hey just another fact about olive oil . It loses its quality after a year from when it was pressed
1447 2018-03-21 20:55:32 As far as the "goal posts", the goal in the Paris Accords, is to limit the Earth's temperature rise by less then  2.7°F by 2100. (1.5°C). 

How much longer do you think the government could keep extracting oil after nationalization to meet that goal?
1448 2018-03-21 20:55:30 Bouta finish writing this childrens book about the United States’ on going expedition to seek oil in foreign lands 
1449 2018-03-21 20:55:15 Coconut oil!
1450 2018-03-21 20:55:07 What's the common thread between Israel. CA. Russia. US Republicans.?  Iran and price of oil?
1451 2018-03-21 20:54:56 I still need a tire, wheel alignment, oil change, & tint. Imma blow a check tryna get my car together .
1452 2018-03-21 20:54:48 You cant light a lamp there's no oil in the house.
It's a shame to want a light.

1458 2018-03-21 20:53:59 One lesson from that I learnt is how to accept blessings in increments. The woman never got a jar full of flour and jar full of oil. But everyday she found oil and flour in her jars.
1459 2018-03-21 20:53:42 Using heart-healthy olive oil instead of butter slashes saturated fat by 85% in cakes, you can get your healthy fats and eat cake too
1460 2018-03-21 20:53:33 Oil

1465 2018-03-21 20:52:23 The revolution is going on without us. While this admin diddles with old technologies like oil/gas/coal and slaps tariffs on solar, China and the rest of the world are moving on without us.
1466 2018-03-21 20:52:18 The American oil memes are a blessing
1467 2018-03-21 20:52:17 There's even a black market for it in Italy. Prices have surged immensely.  Just go look at the price of truffle oil at woolies. You'll apply for a loan

1479 2018-03-21 20:50:54 Any ideas for surgical scar fading oil? I’m particularly interested in essential oils and possibly carrier oils that are restorative/healing
1480 2018-03-21 20:50:47 Long-grain rice, throw in a saucepan. Throw some garlic, ginger and chiles in a frying pan with some oil, brown the garlic, pour into rice pot, as healthy amount of turmeric, some fish sauce, and water to cover the rice + a bit more. Cook rice untl water absorbed. Mix in cilantro
1481 2018-03-21 20:50:44 There is cabal in this country and around the world that profits directly and indirectly from this destruction in the Middle East. Some from oil and gas and others from the industrial war complex. These people are evil.
1482 2018-03-21 20:50:30 No. A void in a chicken nugget that gets filled with molten oil is way worse

1488 2018-03-21 20:49:47 Wasn't Russia and China getting their oil from Venezuela?   I read recently that China has more control over oil prices than OPEC. Don't know if it's true but the article was pretty convincing.

1500 2018-03-21 20:48:40 Being Mediterranean so you put olive oil on literally everything 
1501 2018-03-21 20:48:37 As much as I believe there is an unbreakable tie between Putin & Trump, I don't like to go into conspiracy theories, and I don't believe it is blackmail. IMHO it has to do with $$ and partnering together in making it - related to oil.

1508 2018-03-21 20:48:01 So I go into my local favorite smoke shop, the owner is there and telling me how his other location got raided by cops who confiscated CBD oil. They told them they’ll keep coming back if they restock.

After Koch Oil whining that they must have $4,+ gas at pump to survive= pay Trump + $ mil so he lift pipeline sanctions in first week as pres -- but -- loyal 'T' signs on w/ Saudi when they can sup better crude and pump gas can sell at $2-gal = slow bleed for Koch-+ :)!
1515 2018-03-21 20:47:32 Thor makes a valid point. This is why thousands of Americans are fleeing to Venezuela to escape the hunger, poverty and mismanagement in a massive oil producer.

1517 2018-03-21 20:47:26 Im at work right now...I’m busy but not productive, I’m bout to leave, get an oil change and go home.
1518 2018-03-21 20:47:21 Bizarrely, it would have made more sense if the US fought the war to take all of the oil. Just brazenly done what everyone accused us of. It still wouldn’t have made sense, though.
1519 2018-03-21 20:47:00 On the gas side, spring break! Lots of driving. Imports-exports lower than expected. Modest crude production increase in lower 48, despite rig count increase. The oil market really looked bullish since Monday imho, but the situation got exacerbated by EIA report and ME news
1520 2018-03-21 20:46:59 Repubs started the last two wars we were in. Yemen genocide with sudis=oil. Everybody doesn’t give a shit about native people across party lines no one deals with it.

1524 2018-03-21 20:46:31 Was Putin playing him like a fiddle when Trump approved defensive arms to Ukraine or MDS to Poland? How about when we killed 100 Russian mercenaries in Syria? Or when he lessened our dependence on Russian oil? Or when he got NATO allied to pay more for membership?

1586 2018-03-21 20:39:42 True, but lets not do either.  There's plenty of conventional oil in the world as everyone gradually weans themselves from petrochemicals.  We don't need new, colossally dirty, sources of supply.

1589 2018-03-21 20:39:19 Another huge problem with this is that if us oil companies were nationalized the revenue would only go to help American citizens, well the effects of climate change would affect everyone in the world, particularly the "Global South."

1597 2018-03-21 20:38:41 The US expended $2T+ and 5000 American lives to kill almost a million Iraqis and reduce their cities to rubble. And for what?

1618 2018-03-21 20:35:53 It's simply am argument that nationalization won't results in politicians no longer being bribed by oil companies.

But even beyond bribes, it would put "the state" in a position of profiting directly from oil revenue, and cuts would need to be offset by unpopular tax hikes.

1621 2018-03-21 20:35:32 I'm not in favour of devolving oil revenues: apart from anything else, it'd be a terrible, highly volatile tax base for a devolved parliament. And I don't think it's just England which needs to think harder about the UK picture.

1665 2018-03-21 20:31:02 . . . 30 ppm la desulfurizadora de nafta (33 mil litros hora) y 50 ppm la de gas oil (40 mil litros hora o más). . . Si tiene alguna duda, pase por allá. Quizás no sepa cruzar propios.

1667 2018-03-21 20:30:52 this state is joke. there is always plenty of money for oil subsidies 
1668 2018-03-21 20:30:50 I would just like my car to stop telling me I need an oil change cause I just had one 
1669 2018-03-21 20:30:47 GOD!!!

...Actually, not to pull a Milla myself but wasn’t olive oil actually used by either the Greeks or Romans at one point for gay men sex purposes? Like, on the thighs and not anal sex but
1670 2018-03-21 20:30:45 And one to add to the list - the Clydebank Tomato Industry ( yes it's true prior to 1973 the UK Gov had a bonkers fuel oil subsidy for the under glass Scottish tomato growers that was killed off by the EU) Fantastic! And possibly 'bollocks'
1671 2018-03-21 20:30:36 Well now I know what rancid coconut oil smells and tastes like.
Buying food from Walmart: Not even once...
1672 2018-03-21 20:30:36 ...no stranger to scandal, there was that incident in which it was revealed that their fries were being cooked in oil containing meat byproduct or something, I don’t exactly remember now. That’s a big deal for customers who are vegan or don’t eat certain meats such as beef.
1673 2018-03-21 20:30:21 All of the very best recipes start with "melt butter into olive oil."
1674 2018-03-21 20:29:38 When President Trump allowed coal mines to open for fuel the result is North Korea wanting to meet with America. Internationally reports say it’s stopping Russia economy because we bought natural gas oil overseas and its impacted North Korea nuclear program.
1675 2018-03-21 20:29:37 My secret to my face...I've used bio oil on my face not my stretch marks...because seriously I'm not taking my clothes off for anyone!!!! LoL
1676 2018-03-21 20:29:36 @JustinTrudeau re allowing BP with their track record to explore for oil off NS in water much stormier and twice as deep as Gulf of Mexico, unprecedented depths in fact,a "bridge"is no longer a bridge if you end up destroying everything before you even cross it. #protectNSeconomy
1677 2018-03-21 20:29:27 Freshly showered, exfoliated, shaved, and drenched in coconut oil eating chunky monkey ice cream. I guess u can say I’m living my BEST LIFE
1678 2018-03-21 20:29:25 We recommend our Amazonian clay 12-hr foundation! It's oil-free, gives a natural matte finish, helps control oil and is #vegan! 
1679 2018-03-21 20:29:22 By doing the same things as those who are successful in exports have done. 

We’ve done it in tobacco, we’ve done it in sesame, we do it every darn day in crude oil. 

With HARD WORK other sectors can follow. 

But we need to give ourselves a chance and get a seat at the table.
1680 2018-03-21 20:29:20 That's no way to transport oil, I say it's empty. DANGER DANGER! no one in  their right mind would be allowed to do this.
1681 2018-03-21 20:29:10 thx for sharing, been long oil since end '17 here, interesting you guys have no EM position, I guess that's how your algo is designed, follow the darn models!
1682 2018-03-21 20:29:00 Crinkle cut fries are only good if they're fried in oil. The baked ones had no flavor
1683 2018-03-21 20:28:59 There is no difference in their actions! Obama continued the same wars and expanded them that Bush W left you with! NO DIFFERENCE! HAHAGA! Obama was a bigger friend to big oil than bush w was! No difference!

1692 2018-03-21 20:27:54 Iran produces around  5.1 percent of the world’s total crude oil.  What happens whith all those assets? 

Go figure!!
1693 2018-03-21 20:27:40 @GOP 
Riiight

So now we have
more polluted air & H2O
National parks sold to oil & gas cos.
fewer Consumer Protection rules
Dodd-Frank removed so banking scams can happen

Basically GOP sold out MC & poor to rich

I just took a hot bath with sea salt and lavender essential oil. I feel some relief. #yl #yleo #chronicpain

1700 2018-03-21 20:27:03 FYI, per SourceWatch: Energy Citizens is a front group backed by the American Petroleum Institute, the main trade group and lobbying arm of the oil industry, to fight climate change legislation currently working its way through Congress.
1701 2018-03-21 20:26:57 InfoChip has been creating custom #RFID solutions for Oil & Gas fields for years. We strive to make the perfect tag for every situation.
1702 2018-03-21 20:26:52 All means nothing if we don't own our own mines across the continent. Look at Chad. Has lots of oil, but all belongs to Glencore. Is in debt over oil.. A joke really... Do you think you can have a common currency with guys like that? There's many of them across Africa...
1703 2018-03-21 20:26:52 This is just oil spin designed to mislead.
1704 2018-03-21 20:26:41 The death of free speech is on us.
1705 2018-03-21 20:26:35 Crazy to think..

Remember those 3B barrels we kept hearing about that were floating at sea when oil was sub $30?  I'm sure that's down to 2.9B now, hence the major P recovery
1706 2018-03-21 20:26:32 Yet we still subsidize big OIL.  One of the wealthiest businesses in the world.  (I believe the Military Industrial Complex is the biggest).  Don't quote me, tho, as I've been wrong before.
1707 2018-03-21 20:26:32 i got an essential oil diffuser for the house, ur welcome
1708 2018-03-21 20:26:23 OPEC+? Shale? Saudi prince & trump....way out of oil dominant economies can be lead by russia. See cpi cps. Our ‘70’s
1709 2018-03-21 20:26:22 Wow, do I not Ms. Obama. However, now that Russia has to compete against US oil, I’m thinking Putin Mrs. Obama. Hillary Mrs. him too!! 
1710 2018-03-21 20:26:20 $CVX cup and a handle break out here.  Stk can go to 125/126 and oil is on a rip lately
1711 2018-03-21 20:26:18 Do you have any oil?
1712 2018-03-21 20:26:15 It's difficult to handle Russia. Not only China, EU & UK want us to have a bad relationship with Russia so they can get the cheap oil. Oil companies & Canada also want us to have a bad relationship with Russia. The witch hunt has the same reason why they messed up middle East.
1713 2018-03-21 20:26:10 Tim, if Tracy was doing nude market and oil videos, she'd have more followers than Trump.

1718 2018-03-21 20:25:42 Don't forget, Cheney did all that shit.  9-11 and  Iraq war, all for the oil. Twice the amount to Chevron, BP, etc. for half the price.  That was what was discussed in his secret "energy meeting" in early 2001.  They let 9/11 happen so they could invade the oil rich region.

1721 2018-03-21 20:25:36 I have recently been turned on to sardines as well and keep a few tins around as a go-to snack at least once a week as well as some fish for dinner once a week. Added to fish oil tablets every morning, and macadamia nuts, I hope I have enough!

1727 2018-03-21 20:24:50 Data is the new oil. Who honestly believes they had no idea this was going on or could be? Of course they did! 

They & their investors are just upset it's come to public light and shares are down. Incoming: "we'll audit these app developers", "we didn't know", "we'll do better".
1728 2018-03-21 20:24:38 Listen, all I’m saying is if I had money, I’d be in the tropics right now getting lathered in body oil and drinking a fuckin margarita. BUT NO, I AM EATING SNOW AS I WALK. #reality
1729 2018-03-21 20:24:28 Tar is not oil. Two different substances. And as for 'no blood for oil' the hypocrisy I see of a person enjoying the benefits of our oil-based economy and complaining about it, is beyond comprehension. Pot meet kettle. Hypo meet Crite. You guys are the Pharisees of the modern era

1738 2018-03-21 20:23:49 He apologized to other countries for our war in Iraq, caused by greed for oil.

And American is NOT sick of liberalism, as witnessed by the generic ballot which is at an high-time high for Democrats at +9 to +16 depending on what ridiculous or all-out racist thing Trump does.

1743 2018-03-21 20:23:09 If I see one more article about how to use Vaseline I’m gonna freak out. Kids, Vaseline & baby oil are the worst possible products you can put on your skin! Number one ingredient is mineral oil... that belongs in cars not skin  #thatsallfornow
1744 2018-03-21 20:23:00 1.Castor oil- for strong hairline
2. Coconut oil- for volume, healthiness
3. Hot oil scalp treatment(if your hair is still short)
5. Olive oil for length/ growth
4. Hair mayonnaise- make my own use ordinary mayo and mix it with egg white.

1754 2018-03-21 20:21:59 It's a double conspiracy to suggest foreign groups are driving the resistance against oil tankers and oil spills when real people are demonstrating are seen demonstrating and when pro oil being pumped up anonymous sources on social media. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #RussianBot

1760 2018-03-21 20:21:32 Yeah, it's called beginning to cut back on oil dependency. You know, what I've been saying all along, lol. So you're not done afterall? You want to ruin another day looking dumb and foolish? I live for you ppl.

1769 2018-03-21 20:21:06 Neighborhood idiot "helped" by plowing the side street with his shitty tractor which was leaking gasoline, now the entire street has that rainbow oil slick look to it. That will be part of our runoff during the melt. Thanks for the polluting the Bay, you asshole. #snowday

1772 2018-03-21 20:21:01 @realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr President for the tax cut. Unfortunately since the first of the year, my cable TV has gone up as has my auto insurance and home owners. Now oil is 65 dollars a barrel. So much for my tax break.
1773 2018-03-21 20:20:56 @msnbc AMERICA FIRST? WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS in Belgrade Yugoslavia? Escalating gas/ heating oil at the CCM they control? AMERICA FIRST?
1774 2018-03-21 20:20:45 Oh yeah. I know what you're talking about. I got my mom one a few years ago and I have a couple of those. A new thing I got was this water vapor diffuser that you put scented oil in.

1779 2018-03-21 20:20:11 I took HAL because of it's superior options and the annual summer run on oil. I expect these $45 April 6th to run from .078 to $4.50 now with this bump and my May $47 to run from 0.98 to $5.15 as Oil pushed $68 -$70 into May...clearly a fantastic setup into summer.

1781 2018-03-21 20:20:02 Good point. Ironic & lucky that suburban sprawl bc of oil will be an asset to the economy of the future re: housing and transportation. Cars will be clean. Commuting & telecommuting cheap/easy. Less need for density/expensive public trans. Less tax, avg home prices will fall.
1782 2018-03-21 20:20:00 ADULTING HACK: when your car is getting to the point that it really needs to be vacuumed, it’s probably about time for an oil change and they vacuum your car for you.

Oceans and forests are the two things to help keep things in check and if governments actively helped reduce the built-in absorption they're going to be on the hook to a degree
1789 2018-03-21 20:19:32 you use chalk (aka Satan's pastles)? how's your results? why on earth would you like them over oil?
1790 2018-03-21 20:19:31 Then you have not read Anthony Sampsons book The Seven Sisters how ownership gradually was transferred from the Western oil companies to the Arab oil producers on Arab states demand.

1946 2018-03-21 20:00:53 Now that spring is officially here, it's a good time to check on your lawn equipment. Check fuel & oil, and make sure it'll all start when you're ready to start using it.

1954 2018-03-21 20:00:11 OIL DIFF: 4.37 -> 4.49
1955 2018-03-21 20:00:08 There is no such thing as “responsible” development of oil and natural gas, particularly from shale.  Just because we’re all forced to exist (and thus be complicit with) petroleum culture doesn’t mean we can’t/shouldn’t work to undermine and replace it.
1956 2018-03-21 19:59:55 The money is short term. Oil will run out. Wars give way to peace eventually. It's got to be more than that.
1957 2018-03-21 19:59:46 You seriously think the uk will stop buying whisky, fish, Gin. Cheese, oil, etc etc just because we’re independent. Independence is our gateway to prosperity. Tories are driven by wealth and want to crush the SNP. Don’t let the consequences of fear drive your politics.

1960 2018-03-21 19:59:30 There are no Standard Oil Executives still alive to testify so they have to call someone who controls a vertical monopoly. I see the testimony. "Yes, I have pricing power.

1968 2018-03-21 19:58:23 Should we go through all of Donald Trump's "hinky" financial deals?
How about Mitt Romney?
George W. Bush w/ baseball and oil?

1971 2018-03-21 19:58:03 First of all....
Oil should have been on the ingredients list....

1972 2018-03-21 19:57:53 Yes mate, needs to be at least 10% to be beneficial. Vaped it and even old schooled it tacky on Rizlas. I found it moderate. For pain and sleep and appetite its good. Hope that helps. The honey oil!!! Its THC stacked sleeping gas.
1973 2018-03-21 19:57:39 Super picture. I shall be getting out my oil paints…
1974 2018-03-21 19:57:31 $spx IMHO the possibility of oil going back to 56 is lessening. It is easier to head to 70.
1975 2018-03-21 19:57:31 I will defend California’s environmental protection laws. I refuse to take any campaign contributions from the oil industry — unlike my opponent Xavier Becerra who has taken thousands in oil money and refuses to take on Exxon Mobil over climate change. #AGDebate

 Hey what’s that coconut oil brand you use.. i need to get me some
1977 2018-03-21 19:57:27 Why hasn't San Francisco or Oakland banned all cars and other things in the city that contribute to climate change if they are serious?  After the oil companies, the people should sue the cities for their promotion of climate change.
1978 2018-03-21 19:57:26 @Bamabroker $65 oil bro and haven't heard a word out of you. Time
to get on the short wagon.
1979 2018-03-21 19:57:15 What made him a threat was his use of his oil when combined with his other elemental releases.

1994 2018-03-21 19:55:25 So why the coastal drilling? Why the drilling in National Parks?  We have gas and oil without destroying our coastlines and parks.  Trump is selling off our treasures to cronies. It’s about $$$
1995 2018-03-21 19:55:16 This girl just told me her oil change is 10,000 miles over due I just walked off how dumb can you be
1996 2018-03-21 19:55:13 Bizzare day, but ultimately good for oil bulls.
1997 2018-03-21 19:55:10 does anyone have any advice how to prevent tofu from sizzling and releasing a lot of hot oil because i have about 500 micro oil burns on my right hand alone from pan-frying tofu. and i couldn't keep a pan cover on it permanently because i was mixing it occasionally

1999 2018-03-21 19:54:57 Highly recommend to any girl with uneven tones in their face to use vitamin e oil instead of moisturizer. It’s very oily but does wonders

2003 2018-03-21 19:54:34 You really should note, that it was the unaffordable socialist projects being run in Venuzela that allowed it to be so vunerable. As soon as oil prices dropped they could not afford to their extreme socialist projects and went swiftly bankrupt. Fool.
2004 2018-03-21 19:54:31 Still not an answer farmers want to hear. But let's move more oil through Bill Gates and Warren Buffets Raillines instead of pipelines.

2007 2018-03-21 19:54:20 Ironic that oil prices surged $2 per barrel today, trading above $65.50, just as Powell declared he was not worried about rising inflation.  I think oil prices will be above $80 per barrel by the Nov. elections. I wonder how voters will feel about that as they drive to the polls?
2008 2018-03-21 19:54:17 In the light of CO2, oil, our huge debt etc we need to urgently need to reduce our passion for flying about the country to attend mostly very pointless meetings  and MP's and CEOs are the worst at it. Have they not heard of the Internet.

2013 2018-03-21 19:53:51 The US is currently paying substantially less for Alberta oil than the current market price. Your blog clearly explains why that is. If markets are expanded and customers are willing to pay market prices, would there not be pressure to raise the price of oil going to the US?

2017 2018-03-21 19:53:23 I just did. Very creepy. My dad’s father died in a coal mine accident in 1923. My dad left home at 15 to avoid the mines. How many have died since then?

2035 2018-03-21 19:51:46 OR: Putin, Saudi Prince, Erdogan, et. al.  have plotted to reshape the world's alliances based on oil, wealth, power and domination: a handful of empires instead of countries. Jared leaving Palestinians out of Middle East meetings = complicity with Quatar blockade.
2036 2018-03-21 19:51:43 Not so sure that's a complete answer. Oil runs through Crimea.  Not a major source that I know of but still an important choke-point in the pipeline.
2037 2018-03-21 19:51:35 Si el dueño de los medios K, C5N y Radio 10, y de la petrolera OIL, Cristóbal Lopez, no pagaba impuestos, bueno, entonces nadie paguemos impuestos hasta que los empresarios y políticos corruptos paguen lo que tengan que pagar.

The peacekeeping element in Yugoslavia was overall a good intended mission..
Iraq was only an aggression to secure a stable flow of oil..
2046 2018-03-21 19:50:12 That is what they made the layman to believe. Politics will never be that open. Gaddafi was a threat to them with his pan african ideas and he wanted to radically bring some changes to the oil industry. This was a threat to USA. Human rights abuse will always be an excuse 4 war
2047 2018-03-21 19:50:10 Silence regarding Sunday night's CNY oil contract launch remains deafening
2048 2018-03-21 19:49:55 Our use of 'potential' signifies that new oil exploration will contribute further to climate change IF it continues and IF it were to find new oil / gas. Neither are certain. Burning oil, gas and other fossil fuels certainly contributes to climate change. That's just science.
2049 2018-03-21 19:49:48 @steveliesman @KellyEvansCNBC @RickSantelli .. .  People who own Ferrari's do not know where the water, oil, etc is /correct .. because they sell their Ferrari before their first oil change /h2o top off/ etc hahaha

2051 2018-03-21 19:49:42 A old friend is a salesman at Chevrolet in vac and he gave me the homie discount for a new rim for my car and I’m paying 175 instead of 350. On top of that a free oil change.

2063 2018-03-21 19:48:33 This proposal is *also* delusional b/c it assumes fossil fuel extraction is something that can be done for a reasonable amt of time into the future. also transfers regulatory risk to the public.

Also, if you think public run oil companies don't lead to corruption, look at Brazil
2064 2018-03-21 19:48:29 Come back eh
2065 2018-03-21 19:48:28 I like my pizza ether trashy as hell, folded in half and dripping in oil and chilli or artisanal and covered in rocket. No middle ground.
2066 2018-03-21 19:48:03 $CL_F Damn, took profits too soon. Blasting through all supply above! Scalping long up to 66.08 then see what happens. #OIL #BTFD
2067 2018-03-21 19:48:03 Good Evening Jon Patience.

Well Oil My Shaft It's 7:48PM
2068 2018-03-21 19:47:30 Oil up 3+%? Wondering how much of this action is positioning ahead of tomorrow’s trade tariffs...
2069 2018-03-21 19:47:27 He won't. But what this does do is empower an unelected office with more power than they deserve. Future regrets?
2070 2018-03-21 19:47:21 To control the oil? Hell if we were going to go that then why in the name of God did we give it back??? Taking over OPEC would have have been better.  Also been to Iraq more times than I can remember to count. III CORPS Operations NCO the last time I was there.
2071 2018-03-21 19:47:17 Vitamin e oil, my dudes. It's the only thing keeping me alive and giving me hope that one day I will live a hangnail free life.
2072 2018-03-21 19:47:16 I don’t doubt that. He has a whole oil company, but he’s here pretending to be one of us.
2073 2018-03-21 19:47:07 Traders and analyst  are underestimating the aspect of what exports are having on this market, but instead focusing on increased production. We going higher--much higher.  Exports for oil were almost non existent the last time shale ramped up.
2074 2018-03-21 19:47:06 Who cares??  A president who changed a country in Africa entirely, who spoked the truth,  who kept that Mediterranean border safe,  was killed by the US and allies for no reason other than oil! And Hillary laughter when she found out it's nothing but sick.Look now at Lybia!Shame.
2075 2018-03-21 19:47:00 Quit playing Hannity. Doesnt suit you. Drilling down for oil in land where you have a pernit is ok. Drilling sideways to draw oil outside where you have a pernit is illegal.
2076 2018-03-21 19:46:59 #Oil #Gold #Guns for "moderate rebels" throughout the Middle East. Open #slavery, #HumanTrafficking and #genocide immediately followed.

2077 2018-03-21 19:46:50 those asking #silver price predictions, I don’t have one. I follow timed projections and ratios. ie a silver oz compared to a share of the dow, a medium sized house, a barrel of oil, ratio to gold. etc 
2024 is my ultimate target blow off date. put a gun to my head? $300 minimum
2078 2018-03-21 19:46:47 This is a man who speaks everyman's language, but in truth, not with snake oil.
2079 2018-03-21 19:46:25 it depends on how many quarts of oil your car holds and what type of oil is recommended for your car
2080 2018-03-21 19:46:24 stop the car and get an engine oil immidiately ,else you knock your engine out
2081 2018-03-21 19:46:16 it’s all the oil. did something to the vibrational frequency, back in the 70s.
2082 2018-03-21 19:46:13 @morningmika Politicians in both parties are scared to death of WALL ST. THIEVES and TRAITORS. Instead of taking the market down 1000's pts. each day now they're attacking "we the people" with escalating gas/heating oil? Sad reality for "we the people"!
2083 2018-03-21 19:46:09 Why don't people understand that if they need to use 2 credit cards to pay for a $34 oil change that they shouldn't be driving a $30,000 vehicle..
2084 2018-03-21 19:46:01 just like in Iraq when they claimed there were weapons of mass destruction & stole the oil
2085 2018-03-21 19:46:00 Then why don't they, they sell oil and gas to North Korea, they fight against us in Syria, and support our enemies worldwide, they continue to use cyber attacks against our election process.
2086 2018-03-21 19:45:59 1. Gradually reduce oil drilling / dependence . let it b . finish ur dig & call it a day . dead ppl du not buy cars or gas . If ur resource of choice is killin da planet (not makin us $/helpn us it gotA go hoE
2087 2018-03-21 19:45:47 Click for the map, you'll see New Mexico is a black spot, not even figuring in the top ten, which do include Massachusetts and New Jersey! That's because New Mexico is still all about oil & gas - oh, and nuclear weapons- big time.
2088 2018-03-21 19:45:37 Omg if you’re saying that you will probably hate it lmao. The elderberry is tasty, but sis that oregano oil is DISGUSTING! Put it under your tongue and drink quick! I swear it’s worth it though
2089 2018-03-21 19:45:34 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2090 2018-03-21 19:45:33 After all the uneducated, or such easy targets for smooth talking snake oil salesmen.
2091 2018-03-21 19:45:31 How does corporate oil money operate? Or the Koch brothers? Or Mercer/

You're whining about tiny numbers opposing that massive warchest
2092 2018-03-21 19:45:31 Definitely getting more coconut oil today!
2093 2018-03-21 19:45:21 Simple knee-jerk reaction with no basis in reality. Giving more power to non elected that you may regret someday. Just chill
2094 2018-03-21 19:45:16 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2095 2018-03-21 19:45:14 Anyone use cbd Cannabis oil?
2096 2018-03-21 19:45:08 o rightio, is that why Rose Absolute is much less expensive than Rose oil?

2101 2018-03-21 19:44:22 The first time I got an oil change I didn’t know what to do so I sat in the car the whole time lmao
2102 2018-03-21 19:44:16 It's been over half an hour since I knew where I was and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
2103 2018-03-21 19:44:09 Wait till Alberta shuts off the oil to BC, cant see Morgans numbers being that high
2104 2018-03-21 19:44:04 Lots of oil names breaking out today. $ZN $OBE $DNR among others
2105 2018-03-21 19:43:58 Don’t get body oil on your keyboard!
2106 2018-03-21 19:43:48 I would like to see Puljujarvi get some pp and top 6 mins but the Oil finally have a plan to develop a player for the long haul. Make him earn his minutes and develop a 200 ft game. I’m fine with that. Hopefully this translates in the next year or two.
2107 2018-03-21 19:43:46 A cake made only with eggs, milk, oil and sugar is an omelette. #NailedItnetflix
2108 2018-03-21 19:43:46 I wouldn’t let this guy change my oil .
2109 2018-03-21 19:43:39 Look forward to seeing the results - we love your oil painting hanging on our dining room wall, my favourite!
2110 2018-03-21 19:43:37 ALM se la rifa de mecánica ehhh chavos what is you doing?! Hit up my cousin hasta les hace de comer y les cambia el oil que más quieren? 
2111 2018-03-21 19:43:34 I'm getting an oil change and they offered to wash my car :')))
2112 2018-03-21 19:43:24 Even better dip it in olive oil and vinegar. Tastes so much better.

2116 2018-03-21 19:42:49 Go figure. Gold, Oil, commods go crazy and dollar getting killed on Fed rate rise? It's as if the computers searched out those opposite positions and took them out.
2117 2018-03-21 19:42:43 Needs more beard oil

2121 2018-03-21 19:42:20 I like the smell of oil in the morning $uso
2122 2018-03-21 19:42:13 I think we have dueling narratives here—one where they're sleazy and all-powerful, one where they're sleazy and selling snake oil. I think the snake-oil story is more compelling.
2123 2018-03-21 19:42:07 I like to add a little coconut oil first so it goes on really smooth!
2124 2018-03-21 19:42:06 That crude oil futures contract is gonna be a game changer for real
2125 2018-03-21 19:42:05 And it’s supposed to be the 21st century. Wonder if that was organic anointing oil.
2126 2018-03-21 19:41:51 You guys ever take fish protein with your fish oil?  Apparently, it's just called fish.

2132 2018-03-21 19:41:05 They promoted something that didn't exist? 
Simple bastardization of language is what your using. Something dems are masters of.
2133 2018-03-21 19:41:03 Sanction on entities not enough. Impose on oil market and oil products from SSDN. After all, it’s not benefiting any citizen other Than the president’s family and clan.

2140 2018-03-21 19:40:12 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this March? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
2141 2018-03-21 19:40:06 You're welcome. Without US, nobody would have affordable oil at all
2142 2018-03-21 19:40:03 Edibles. You don’t want to risk dry socket by sucking on a bong or pipe. If you do get dry socket, have your dentist pack it with cloves or use clove oil - dry socket is the worst.
2143 2018-03-21 19:39:48 Biasanya ngegunain Bio oil buat ngehilangin bekas luka, terus td iseng gw coba ke jerawat gw (lg ada 1 jerawat di kening) dannnnn..... langsung kempes dalam sekejap! Ga ngerti lagiiii

2148 2018-03-21 19:38:55 exit oil 65.48
2149 2018-03-21 19:38:54 Perhaps if nationalization were done without compensation. But why put money into oil that could go to renewable energy projects that would also generate revenue?

People still pay for electricity if it comes from sunlight.

2157 2018-03-21 19:36:50 They want to pay the oil companies a trillion dollars to buy an industry that should be outlawed, essentially it's an insane bailout when the proper thing to do would be to invest that money in renewable energy projects, which are actually more profitable over the long term.
2158 2018-03-21 19:36:49 You may think you are - I did once. Bu all of the safety trials are fraudulent -
they contain aluminium and aborted fetal cells which have been linked to autism.
They have also gifted us deadly peanut allergies as peanut oil used as an ingredient. Vaccines are harming our kids.
2159 2018-03-21 19:36:46 Sniffing to much oil today?
2160 2018-03-21 19:36:38 The #CPC shoved Pierre Poilivre's plagiarized gerrymandering law "Fair Elections Act" based on an American designed Republican voter suppression law in Texas, down Canadian's throats.

2161 2018-03-21 19:36:36 Had movie plans now I’m stuck here waiting an hour for an oil change 
2162 2018-03-21 19:36:34 Hi, you should get zinc, vItamin-c, ELDERBERRY syrup (IMPORTANT) and oregano oil. Oregano oil is also a godsend. It’s disgusting but it really helps. Next time you feel yourself getting sick take elderberry 3x a day and oregano oil and I promise you won’t
2163 2018-03-21 19:36:32 Did Obama present Russia with a "reset" button?
Did Obama let Putin move in to assist Iran & Syria?
Did Obama let Russia take Crimea?
Did Obama attack US Oil & Gas production?
DId Obama sell 20% of US Uranium to RUSSIA?
Did Trump do any of those?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes,
Yes.
Yes.
No.
2164 2018-03-21 19:36:28 These contain 10% coconut oil, which is 87% saturated fat. A 35g bar contains around 3g saturated fat. I wouldn't share these with anyone who has a weight or cholesterol problem.

2167 2018-03-21 19:36:11 “Uh... On an oil rig? Great business plan, Callie.
2168 2018-03-21 19:36:05 Maybe he should have listened to us million people who marched in the streets, begging 'no more blood for oil'. We, the people, knew because we read the news.
2169 2018-03-21 19:36:02 The rusdians break sanctions on NK by selling oil on high seas to them. They have provided no help on ISIS and won't and we don't need their help. Theyurder people with plutonium and nerve gas in UK. They mwddled in our election. Russians threatened to nuke us. Real helpful
2170 2018-03-21 19:35:50 One bright spot is, criminals flock to sanctuary cities making rest of us safer. 
2171 2018-03-21 19:35:33 They do provide by major commodity but crude oil is lumped with other petroleum products, which masks just crude.  NEB has just crude.
2172 2018-03-21 19:35:26 i'm laughing so loud with the america and oil meme my flatmate knocked on my door to see if i was alright
2173 2018-03-21 19:35:22 $STO stat oil. Publicly traded.
2174 2018-03-21 19:35:06 Why not be Allies with the second most powerful nation? Who has more nukes than us, more icebreaker ships than us, and literally owns the artic and all the oil there?
2175 2018-03-21 19:34:44 Doesn't appear to say shared traits like: smoking? diet? exercise? sleep? stress? veg oil intake correlate to blood levels? etc
Plus observational study so even then it'd only suggest, not confirm anything.
Considering it's based on ox levels (?), probably all of the above + more

2180 2018-03-21 19:34:07 Well, if it was sitting for long time and seized, we often use transmission oil to lose the rings up. Same story, spark plug out oil in wait for a couple of hours. Most of the time it helps.
2181 2018-03-21 19:34:05 Oil change , wheel alignment , 2 new tires it better tf
2182 2018-03-21 19:34:04 We don’t, and our “dream land” will soon be reality and all will prosper within our nation and not just a select privileged few. 

PS - Chavez reformed Venezuela massively but because of oil prices dropping (the economy was dependent on it) the country thus faced a downfall.
2183 2018-03-21 19:34:04 I don't even know where to start... A "for every" statement relating butter and coconut oil? A rant about containing no chemicals?
2184 2018-03-21 19:34:01 I feel special when one of my gfs sends me a video of her doing her hot oil treatment. 
2185 2018-03-21 19:33:57 Hedge funds were 93.8% net long at $61.25 oil on March 13.

Today, March 21st, Oil now near $65.50.

I'm going to assume hedge funds are now over 95% net long crude oil futures.  This is the largest net long oil positioning ever recorded.
2186 2018-03-21 19:33:37 I like to use @CHEVOOlife goat cheese, then after the cheese is gone I use the infused olive oil it's packed in as a finish on these flat bread things, because why the hell would I waste it?
2187 2018-03-21 19:33:34 Better to take out a loan than to be in the pocket of big oil, NRA, Pharma, etc.  @GOP you are going DOWN!!!!!!!!
2188 2018-03-21 19:33:33 Why is /CL ripping? I’ll give my 2 cents on that today… I’ve been the lone Oil Bull lately.

2195 2018-03-21 19:32:49 Robyn,

There is an internet meme going around saying that you protested Keystone, and "dirty oil". Is this true or a lie?
2196 2018-03-21 19:32:47 Greens ? It's rosemary dipped in olive oil and lemon (λαδιλέμονο)
2197 2018-03-21 19:32:46 My favourite salady side is feta and cucumber chopped into cubes and  mixed with pitted olives and a little olive oil. I'm also a big fan of avocado, do you have any interesting avocado side salads you make? #AldiEasterFeasters
2198 2018-03-21 19:32:42 Lord that stupid ass oil they put on your feet at the nailshop fucked up my tights

* Knead for about 3 minutes.

Serve in a bowl.
2200 2018-03-21 19:32:37 The WALL ST. lobbyists are helping to put pressure on Congress by proving how high they can take gas/heating oil at the CCM. How does helping them help "we the people" when these thieves and traitors are hurting taxpayers?
2201 2018-03-21 19:32:34 Yup. Liverpool have never wanted oil money....

2204 2018-03-21 19:32:25 It couldn’t possibly be that I’ve been called fat since I was 100lbs and became anorexic and now I binge eat to compensate but yeah, ruby, it’s the olive oil that’s the problem 
2205 2018-03-21 19:32:24 Different times and circumstances...when POTUS Obama called him we didn't have Russians in the Oval Office,  our election compromised and our allies being poisoned.  Russia is playing him like a fine fiddle, and they and China are working to support N Korea with oil, coal and $$

2207 2018-03-21 19:32:21 Come on Mate, you know our atmosphere can't be matched, and no, we haven't won the title for a while, but it's coming. Oil bought yours.
2208 2018-03-21 19:32:20 how about keeping the planet cooler without oil usage?
2209 2018-03-21 19:32:19 refuse to believe that no oil money was involved
2210 2018-03-21 19:32:15 It means what they tell us it means, OR ELSE.
2211 2018-03-21 19:32:14 "With only 2 percent of the world's proven reserves of #oil, we in the United States can pump until we are blue in the face and it will not change the fact that we need more diverse and more secure sources of #energy."

2212 2018-03-21 19:32:07 Sunflower oil. Rub a drop into your nails, nail bed and cuticles.
2213 2018-03-21 19:32:00 Whenever I’m getting an oil change and they say I’m due for “blah blah blah” and i don’t know what it means I just say no. So I’m probably the worst car owner ever, like just change my oil and if a light comes on later I’ll be back. Hahahaha.
2214 2018-03-21 19:31:43 At the end of the day you will be more successfully getting the world off of oil than changing people so they are happy without a job.
2215 2018-03-21 19:31:39 So you predict the price of oil being sold currently to the United States to feed our supply would go down if the market from the pipeline was opened up to other markets through the #KM expansion?
2216 2018-03-21 19:31:37 Sorry, "housing crisis profiteer and foreign-funded oil and gas mouthpiece Suzanne Anton" is in the Post today. I should have clarified.
2217 2018-03-21 19:31:37 Venezuela’ s oil is impossible for American oligarchs to resist. Like Trump, they are just rich, not intelligent. Crypto currency will demonstrate who the genuinely smart people are. Block chain is not as vulnerable as National or international currency or gold.

2221 2018-03-21 19:31:23 Lmao, hell yeah. you put me on with the olive oil.
2222 2018-03-21 19:31:22 102 yr old woman says she exercises 2-3 days a week, eats her greens, fruit and cod liver oil and pours Hennessey into her coffee every now and then. This woman could be on to something.
2223 2018-03-21 19:31:19 take the case of Venezuela. has the highest reserves of oil. still a failed country due to communism.
2224 2018-03-21 19:31:09 EVs at 3 or 4% of market share are irrelevant to oil. But if they can implement a solid state battery, eg graphene and cities like London/ LA/ New York mandate EVs only, then EVs suddently become over half the new car sales. But they need to fix the battery tech first.

- EVS will NOT affect oil demand, they will affect Growth in Oil Demand.  Growth in oil demand will continue until 2050, even with strong EV penetration.
- EVs are replacing efficient ICE vehicles, CNG, and biodiesel.

2337 2018-03-21 19:17:23 No it is not about pressure it is about access to market. Once the oil is on the open market it can command market prices. In Alberta, when restricted by transportation issues, it is not on the open market but rather on a smaller closed market.

2347 2018-03-21 19:16:18 It’s easy to play socialist with several hundred billion dollars in the oil fund. When it runs out, you’re just Venezuela.
2348 2018-03-21 19:16:17 I think the stock markets in uk going to go nuts tomorrow. Oil up 3% good rising nicely, RRS ex div tomorrow. Dollar sliding pound looking like a giant s rise. Some big winners and some big losers tomorrow. In the whole should be good
2349 2018-03-21 19:16:16 Took the media hype - "data is the new oil/data is the new gold" - too seriously!!
2350 2018-03-21 19:15:51 To cleanse a leper they put blood on the right ear, thumb and big toe. Oil was then place over the blood. This signifies the Spirit will only anoint what the blood has bought and cleansed.
2351 2018-03-21 19:15:48 Who financed the exploration? and the waters are and were British. Many Scots have had a good living from oil and good luck to them and it has served Britain well.
2352 2018-03-21 19:15:24 Yes same!!! I've exfoliated too hard once w a little rubber scrub thing and my skin peeled so bad my foundation looked so gross it was so bad  me too though. This oil I got feels soooo good to my skin.
2353 2018-03-21 19:15:19 So I got hot oil thrown on my face today, needless to say I need to find another job. 
2354 2018-03-21 19:15:19 Saudi crown prince to meet #defense, and #entertainment executives in LA - he also hopes to convince #investors that Saudi Arabia is a safe bet, that its strictly regulated society is becoming less repressive, and that it has more to offer than oil.
2355 2018-03-21 19:15:10 Beats another story about a washed up porn star.

2358 2018-03-21 19:14:57 Look Suncor and Other oil/gas co's pay Only what they have to ... trying to get ppl into the industry... If there was a GLUT of oil workers applying for jobs (Like there are Teachers etc.) wages would Drop Proportionately... We should hire BC teachers?
2359 2018-03-21 19:14:51 Yeah, look at oil, Ag, and Au go!

2364 2018-03-21 19:14:19 China& India are huge consumers of #palmoil as it is the cheapest form of cooking oil. Even in  Myanmar, palmoil has replaced traditionally used #peanutoil as the most commonly used cooking oil. The ones really paying the price: wild #orangutan populations
2365 2018-03-21 19:14:14 I use @doterra peppermint oil in my diffuser at night to help me sleep
2366 2018-03-21 19:14:10 Russia needs the USA to pull out of Iran deal so they can sell the nuclear material and equipment to them. N Korea, Russia needs to sell them oil.  They already own Syria you sir ate his puppet

2371 2018-03-21 19:13:18 Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?
2372 2018-03-21 19:13:09 The EU can do a better job with dealing with though countries and they are based on Democracy. Russia is based on a sham. Help EU countries diversify away from Russian oil and gas and watch them collapse. The answer is not to become a puppet like you've done...
2373 2018-03-21 19:12:46 My mom gave me this essential oil pill and I keep burping it up, it tastes like I ate a fucking pine tree
2374 2018-03-21 19:12:37 There are folks that believe in the ridiculous notion that if we start selling oil to Asia, we'll pressure the US into paying us more for our sub quality oil. If BC's fuel supply comes from the US, that would take the wind out of your argument entirely. #bcpoli
2375 2018-03-21 19:12:35 Just like trump they don’t comprehend anything!

2381 2018-03-21 19:12:01 Russia (Putin) is CAUSING problems with North Korea (illegally supplying oil despite sanctions), Syria (bombing indiscriminately, killing civilians), Ukraine (illegally trying to annex).  The COMING ARMS RACE? WTF are you planning?
2382 2018-03-21 19:12:00 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2383 2018-03-21 19:11:44 also the story that our masters want to scare us away from nuclear energy makes no sense because it is undeniable that they themselves are making every effort to get rid of oil and replace it with nuclear as "green energy"
2384 2018-03-21 19:11:36 God is about to change your financial situation.. Your last minute miracle has come. If you believe sow a seed to your local church and ask your pastor to pray for you and anoint you with oil!

2433 2018-03-21 19:05:59 My husband and I used to own a forensics geochemistry lab tracing the origin of oil spills to the producing oil field. So yes, it should be possible to identify source of chemical weapons.

I wld rather wind farms off our coast, as was suggested, but I'll never vote for oil platforms. Agree abt the beauty of Vermont countryside.
2439 2018-03-21 19:05:00 Does it just say "Oil"?
2440 2018-03-21 19:04:49 @realDonaldTrump How high are your pals on WALL ST. who control the Chicago Commodity Markets going to take gas/heating oil. The day they took over the CCM gas spiked .50cents in 5 seconds. So much for "we the people" and your followers. SAD!
2441 2018-03-21 19:04:49 Most people don't realize this. Or they oppose pipeline but want oil trucked in or on the rail. This is even worse.

2445 2018-03-21 19:04:13 What does our trade surplus consist of? Oil and gas, nollywood movies and music. Would these be seriously hit by our abstention from the free trade agreement? No.

On the other hand, who gains more from this agreement? We have mushroom industries of Chinese, Indians and Lebanese

2450 2018-03-21 19:03:54 Federal offshore oil and gas lease sale today saw almost no increase in total money offered but substantial increase in numbers of leases getting bids. Cost discipline on part of oil companies, maybe. And it is not a virgin frontier.

2453 2018-03-21 19:03:38 I saw an article a few months ago stating that Putin agreed to give Trump a percentage of profits from oil drilling in Crimea.  All Trump has to do is lift the sanctions.  Putin probably has other leverage on him as well.

2458 2018-03-21 19:03:20 The Cold War ended decades ago.  We do need to compete with Russia in the oil and natural gas markets - and win!
2459 2018-03-21 19:03:12 You're an idiot if you think private jets make up even .01% of the climate change problem.
Maybe if they didn't have a need to travel so damn much fighting the lies of big oil, lies pushed by your CONservative party for decades now, then they wouldn't fly so much.
2460 2018-03-21 19:03:05 Very few people understand the geopolitics of oil and gas.  What @realDonaldTrump has done for America has erased pathetic Democrat laws and regulations that prevented America from leading the world in energy.

2470 2018-03-21 19:02:09 Oil had everything to do with hitler breaking his deal with stalin not to invade the soviet union. Its the only reason he did, the southern oil feilds. These are just facts of history.
2471 2018-03-21 19:01:49 I think it’s safe for me to start using beard oil now.
2472 2018-03-21 19:01:45 Will do. We prefer to keep it cash-y though up here working all this OT to provide the world with the oil it needs. Don't worry though I'll hit up the Okanagan like I do every year to spend some of this hard earned cash on good times and good weed.

2481 2018-03-21 19:00:53 Oil is still climbing
2482 2018-03-21 19:00:46 Where there's oil production, there's failed states. Keeping it bellow 50
2483 2018-03-21 19:00:44 @JosefSchachter 1) Mr. Schachter I've been studying the Canadian bitumen sector. Most of US  tight oil production growth is ultra-light oil. On the other hand, Venezuela and Mexico's heavyoil output has been declining.  Despite bottleneck can Canadian heavyoil producers take adv?
2484 2018-03-21 19:00:43 ExxonMobil, our oil, US military base any correlation?

2488 2018-03-21 19:00:15 That's a given really. 

I wonder if she has enough antipathy in her background to deal with the oil companies and their media games. Shane Jones seems like he might be useful here. Just need to convince him that CC is the biggest issue.
2489 2018-03-21 19:00:12 @MercedesUKTeam - booked my service a month ago for service B tomorrow only to get a call this afternoon to say service cancelled as worldwide shortage of oil filters for C class petrol cars - seriously????

2511 2018-03-21 18:57:42 Suzanne Anton is in the National Post today raising the alarm about "foreign money" influencing Canada's energy debate.

Yes, same Suzanne Anton whose BC Liberal party hoovered up millions in campaign donations from out-of-province coal, oil and gas companies.  #bcpoli
2512 2018-03-21 18:57:39 What is your point? Oil had nothing to do with WWII. Fascism is what started WWII. 
RUSSIANS DIED DEFENDING THEIR NATION. As expected. So did the other allied nations. So what? Jews were rounded up and exstermined. They were allowed to return to their home of history.
2513 2018-03-21 18:57:28 Adding a *little* coconut oil to the mix helps too.
2514 2018-03-21 18:57:28 if only we could end oil dependency of producers of oil from consumers of it, usually Third world from First world. Not many people knows that China before the 1980's economic reforms was exporter of oil, now it's complete opposite - is biggest importer of oil.
2515 2018-03-21 18:57:25 Since your are aware of how many people they have killed, can you enumerate! Have you heard about the Ogoni oil spill pollution? Have your heard about the recent pollution report of IOCs? Do you know anything about Nigeria and the Niger Delta? Are you a Nigerian?

2517 2018-03-21 18:57:21 Congratulations @GetFruityBar! On revealing that the 10% coconut oil in their bars is 87% saturated fat, and that concentrated fruit sugars are still sugars (refined or not) I was promptly blocked. Healthy snacks, or healthy profits? #unhealthfoods #GetFruityBarHealthRisk
2518 2018-03-21 18:57:20 That is very kind of you and most appreciated!  I am for the most part self taught, creating an image digital or in Oil is almost like breathing.  There is a thought process, but it is done on a level I cannot articulate.  I’m looking for the image I see / feel in my mind.
2519 2018-03-21 18:57:17 Because Crude oil. How much did all that comes to in other sectors. If we have a trade surplus it is because of Crude oil.

2528 2018-03-21 18:56:53 The party of your choice? Thats like saying crime is a choice. I will never forget how Maxine Henry Wilson stated that Jamaica has no power over oil prices and the jlp incited the gas riots. I thank my Principal Mr Taylor, cause all the jlp gang wanted to do was rob courts stores
2529 2018-03-21 18:56:44 Dear @chicagotown please go back to putting your dough balls in foil packaging and get rid of this plastic cake tin looking monster, they cooked so much better in the foil and had more garlic oil to coat them 
2530 2018-03-21 18:56:42 Nice! We have this super expensive coconut oil that my Mom gave me, so last night I noticed poor Meep was so dry and thought maybe that is why he is so mean to the other cats, so I tried this...still an asshole but his coat is shiny and his skin seems less dry so win I guess 
2531 2018-03-21 18:56:38 Oil or acrylic? Craigslist almost always has good easels on sale for cheap, but I totally feel you on lack of space. The big reason I took a painting class this semester is cause it's so difficult for me to do so at home

2534 2018-03-21 18:56:23 Oil should be falling too. : ]
2535 2018-03-21 18:56:19 13 year olds live in fantasy worlds where everything runs off happy thoughts and rainbows. Up here in adult hood we realize how important oil is and how important it is to get to available markets. Now excuse me while I go fit this pipe together. 
2536 2018-03-21 18:56:09 Asparagus.  Grilled it and put some olive oil with salt and pepper.  Have it at least once a week now.

2540 2018-03-21 18:55:56 What??? You’re saying a low oil level (for example) should stop a major case? What if he’d killed so,some?
2541 2018-03-21 18:55:45 Treats about cutting oil to BC when you even supply us. Tactics should be different from both your top leaders, choose the aggressive way to go about this instead of using business sense. Respecting the environment by getting these foreign companies to take more accountability
2542 2018-03-21 18:55:44 Europe sees off a mixed close, with Fed, BoE policies in the wings. Corporate Earning & updates were at center-stage too. Retail, Marts treaded lower. Airlines stepped back on sharp up-moves in Brent oil. Bond prices fell. $FTSE-0.32% $CAC-0.24% $DAX+0.01%. EPA: #HERMES+2.4%.

2555 2018-03-21 18:54:30 If she can convince dudes she's orgasming on camera, I don't doubt she could beat a polygraph. That doesn't mean she's telling the truth...there's a reason they don't use them in court, lol.

Nobody said oil shouldn’t exist. Not once did I say that.

2572 2018-03-21 18:53:03 Only the jews were rounded up like sheep and herded to their deaths. The Soviets lost 25mil people to oil, not extermanation. And yes every country that fought ww2 lost hundreds, thousands or millions...fighting against the nazis, not while living among them.
2573 2018-03-21 18:53:03 Ugh dropping that shit or any kind of oil is my worst nightmare lol

2577 2018-03-21 18:52:37 We are not on same page. Call Putin and ask him why he’s trading oil for gold or oil for USD and then using the USD to buy Gold.
2578 2018-03-21 18:52:30 Oga when it comes to Lagos,just forget it,I was born and bred here,I physically and mentally took part in major construction projects here.
2579 2018-03-21 18:52:25 "A group of oil truckers once tried robbing Dallas while he slept. A nearby town reported an Oil Surplus in their tanks the next morning."
So basically, Dallas is badarse

2583 2018-03-21 18:51:37 I would’ve given him as many gram dabs as he wanted. He refused THCA terpsolate. A $120+ gram of oil of a toro terp slurper.....

2585 2018-03-21 18:51:03 We have "Oilfield Prayer Day" every Oct. 13th, our governor asks us to pray for the oil industry annually. There is an Oilfield Prayer Breakfast. I don't think outsiders know what we're up against.
2586 2018-03-21 18:50:56 Ha! I love them too! Roasted, or my fave, sauted in a little butter/olive oil, lots of salt & pepper. Yum!
2587 2018-03-21 18:50:55 On my skin (mostly face), also once a month I do a warm oil treatment on my scalp/hair. And I rub it on my nails and toenails. Do you exfoliate enough? Sometimes you have to exfoliate a lot in order to see better results.
2588 2018-03-21 18:50:54 Yes, maybe bt others r export based. Others like Angola are commodity/oil based. Africa is fragmented with many 'lifetime' rulers/Presidents
2589 2018-03-21 18:50:49 Ultraboosts are machine washable but the stain left on them was oil based. Needed a bit more attention.

I would never put the Concords in the washer because of the patent leather. Also they tend to be very fragile in general.

2611 2018-03-21 18:47:38 I've given you an answer and evidence to support it: WW1, Treaty of Versailles, the US oil embargo on Japan and militaristic posturing.

2619 2018-03-21 18:46:54 Sorry, The US being #1 oil & gas producer is nothing to b proud of. Instead of leading the way forward with green power innovation we r dragging the world down &back to using an antiquated form of energy, which btw contaminates soil, air &drinking water aquifers & kills oceans
2620 2018-03-21 18:46:49 Lol you're talking under her thread

2624 2018-03-21 18:46:37 How much oil does Quebec import? How much does Canada? What was December's biggest addition to the Canadian deficit? How do deficits vs revenue help pay for green projects? (See Norway) of those examples, who contributes more to their society and the world vs GHG reductions?
2625 2018-03-21 18:46:37 You wouldn't steal a car
You wouldn't steal a handbag
You wouldn't pirate a movie
So why
would you drink a quart of motor oil?
2626 2018-03-21 18:46:35 but seriously who wants to give me some CBD oil cuz this pain is fucking awful I swear
2627 2018-03-21 18:46:35 At Infiniti, getting my oil changed, contemplating whether or not Ima sprawl out on this couch and take a nap while I wait or..

2630 2018-03-21 18:46:19 Coconut oil is the best thing
2631 2018-03-21 18:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet benefits magnet.
2632 2018-03-21 18:46:05 LOL. Who knew there was a brussel sprout Gif!!  I actually bought a bag to cook tonight—  I like to oven roast them with olive oil and a little salt.  My whole family will be complaining!
2633 2018-03-21 18:46:03 The problem for oil companies is the assymetry of liability. Their counterparties in government had their downside limited to losing elections while the companies could, in an extreme case, lose everything.
2634 2018-03-21 18:46:00 Finished from there.
2635 2018-03-21 18:45:58 Oil up baby and I have a warm surprise for you
2636 2018-03-21 18:45:57 Does anyone use castor oil on their eyelashes??
2637 2018-03-21 18:45:56 That comment is pure BS .  That may be some staged or photo shopped picture of some kind of Oil or crude.  It is not ash.  NO Coal plant in the US disposes of fly ash into any waterway.

2642 2018-03-21 18:45:38 If you’re having a problem with frizz try Moroccan oil! I also have frizzy hair and it works amazingly at keeping the curl but eliminating the frizz!

2645 2018-03-21 18:45:30 @petenajarian Why doesn't anyone seem concerned that Oil is above $65? Doesn't the cost to produce goods matter anymore? Just look at the Airlines! An increase of fuel & wages is starting to hit the bottom line! Long $ALK!

2651 2018-03-21 18:45:05 There’s an Oil (er) crisis and the Flame is getting very dim...Go Jets!!!
2652 2018-03-21 18:44:55 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2653 2018-03-21 18:44:55 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2654 2018-03-21 18:44:51 And you would frack their land and drill for oil.  Shame on you
2655 2018-03-21 18:44:49 You haven't found the ingredients yet?  Before this oil burns, you need to bring me a fat white fish and an Ice Crystal!
2656 2018-03-21 18:44:31 Similar. Not quite as awful, since the parcels that did lease today brought in some money, but it’s an indication that oil & gas aren’t really interested in what Zinke’s selling, and taxpayers are getting ripped off because only 10 parcels today had >1 bid.
2657 2018-03-21 18:44:30 We always after that mf oil fellas yfm
2658 2018-03-21 18:44:29 Making a scene about a £40 oil change for his car whilst wearing a Rolex gotta love some customers
2659 2018-03-21 18:44:28 Oil just broke through $65 a barrel, leading indicators support this move going even higher to be at or above $70 by the end of April.

What does that mean for investors?

The two year slump is over and it’s time to go back and get low hanging fruit.

2662 2018-03-21 18:44:05 Anecdotally I know a lot of people (myself included) who have noticed huge reductions in sub sensitivity after going keto. Most people who do that also greatly decrease their seed oil consumption by default too

2666 2018-03-21 18:43:47 But it is still dirty oil, carbon-intensive to process, and carbon-releasing to use.  It needs to stay in the ground.  You can't compromise with climate change.  Sorry.  #StopKM #KeepItInTheGround
2667 2018-03-21 18:43:38 I struggle everyday to find where I hid my oil from the previous day. What a life I live.

2669 2018-03-21 18:43:35 Oil runs the world in Oklahoma. They are desperately afraid of a #NoDAPL type situation happening here, hence stifling our rights.

2677 2018-03-21 18:43:02 What about the damage to the oil and gas industry from Bexit? You just troll in about fishermen because they have a PR system that drowns out the voices of the 62% that voted to remain. The solution for fishermen is for a Scottish Government to negotiate a solution for our waters
2678 2018-03-21 18:43:01 The abandonment of the blue collar worker (miner, oil rig personnel, etc.) is what lost you the election, suggest reverting your platform.

2691 2018-03-21 18:41:04 Next up, Trump will make the left explode by pulling another Obama trick by saying on a hot mic he didn't know was on " tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility after my reelection" 

Trump is following Obama's lead except for the weapons he sent to Ukraine and the oil to Europe.
2692 2018-03-21 18:41:03 Hey yank, get your president to pull the extremists they've armed and fund out of syria. Americas funds enable them to decapitate men, women and children. If they weren't so obsessed with oil there would be no need for aid.
2693 2018-03-21 18:40:47 @maddiemoate My 4 year old, Darcey, thinks you should make a feature about how oil spills are cleaned up after I showed her where I work...
2694 2018-03-21 18:40:44 Please don't use castor oil! There's no medical evidence that it works and will just make you feel sick and add extra stress to babies! Long walks and lots of water. Good luck momma!
2695 2018-03-21 18:40:21 Have you tried peppermint oil pills? It honestly works wonders
2696 2018-03-21 18:40:20 Friends does anyone know if rice milk is any good... or if I could try other alternatives

(Almond milk tastes like dirt to me, soy milk is... strong, coconut feels like drinking oil)
2697 2018-03-21 18:40:16 Unfortunately, human history proves that it takes a tragedy for a universal action to occur, always... For example, when US-President Nixon created The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from a oil spill along the coast of California.

2707 2018-03-21 18:38:57 Teach me how to cook eggplant properly. I really like eggplant, but my attempts thus far have not produced satisfactory results. Am I using too much oil? Pls help.
2708 2018-03-21 18:38:50 JFC. And because the GOP is so beholden to the oil and gas industry, they DEFINITELY won't be raising THEIR taxes. Soon, we won't have any teachers here in Oklahoma. And no teachers = mass exodus of citizens from the state.
2709 2018-03-21 18:38:49 Dude, I'm allergic to mushrooms, trace amounts of the oil can kill me.
Am I still responsible to smell a d search for trace oil when I order and inform the kitchen of my allergy?

The restaurant is liable. It is their responsibility when they accept the order with known issues.
2710 2018-03-21 18:38:49 Have you ever heard of essential oils???? If you put lavender oil diluted in coconut oil and virgin blood all over your face at the full moon, your skin will be flawless.
2711 2018-03-21 18:38:45 I don't think there's a mechanism for new oil exploration outside the block offer process is there? Unless JA is considering just changing the name or starting something similar under a new name (seems unlikely) I think ending the block offer process means ending oil exploration.

2730 2018-03-21 18:37:35 Both good things. The Jews lost millions in WWII concentration camps. They needed a home state. We were building a nation after a costly war to free the World. The life engine fir commerse was oil. So why do you have a problem with any of that?
2731 2018-03-21 18:37:33 Nothing this government hates than tyrannical states with poor human rights records. Unless they are in sunny places, have oil and like to buy arms.
2732 2018-03-21 18:37:27 Thank you !! I’ll try it , I took some on guard this morning but I’ll try and find some capsules for the oregano oil :)

2745 2018-03-21 18:36:35 Getting my oil changed and they told me I needed a cabin air filter replacement

Buddy just a few months ago I dropped over $1000 to get my air conditioning fixed.

They changed the filter, and leaves on the filter does not make it a bad filter.

2755 2018-03-21 18:35:51 A refreshing facial mask, vivid red, with earth, rosewood oil, and exfoliating beach sand. It's sold as a block wrapped in paper.
2756 2018-03-21 18:35:39 It’s amazing how much better your car runs when you finally get your oil changed. 
2757 2018-03-21 18:35:34 Lol, this is awesome
2758 2018-03-21 18:35:26 It's all the same dictatorship(empire). How did Arabia become Saudi Arabia? 19 of the hijackers were Saudi. It's no secret. Think petrodollar. Dollar is reserve currency to buy oil. Somehow, you have internet. All info is available. Corporate western "news" aside.
2759 2018-03-21 18:35:15 That shading and line work is I N C R E D I B L E! Hope the pain was alright, result was more than worth it tho (hopefully?), also idk what your artist recommended you but don't use vaseline! Coco oil or baby oil does the job a looottt better
2760 2018-03-21 18:35:12 Always wondered why my rubber band stocks crashed.
2761 2018-03-21 18:35:10 First of all. What does one do with concentrated butter oil?
2762 2018-03-21 18:35:07  is a vibrating brush that you use to wash your face ....you will need a faxewash to wash your face or soap an apply the oil when you go to bed it helps tightening you pores to prevent black heads
2763 2018-03-21 18:34:47 If you have mixed skin, try showering at night then use Coconut oil, It will change you, revitalize your skin & give you natural glow!! My skin isn’t really oily anymore, so I use it as a moisturizer and even makeup remover & it’s super healthy!!! (Especially if you get organic!)
2764 2018-03-21 18:34:44 Afghanistan, Syria etc., new wars after Iraq. Afghanistan has uranium, copper etc. and the popey seed. Iraq's oil must be depleting.
2765 2018-03-21 18:34:34 We've been on the oil standard since we switched from gold. But more importantly U.S was able to get Saudi Arabia to only accept the U.S dollar. Making foriegn countries have to export to America, making America rich while printing paper.
2766 2018-03-21 18:34:30 Why do we trade with foreign countries in US $ while those countries don't use the US $ as their currency? Those who know, purport that Gaddafi & Saddam were murdered as they suggested to sell their oil resource in their native currencies. Mahmoud Ahmedinejad retreated. But Why?
2767 2018-03-21 18:34:06 Put oil down the lane and slide on stomach.
2768 2018-03-21 18:34:02 I really have no clue when it comes to cars, been driving with no oil or water 
2769 2018-03-21 18:34:00 334
2770 2018-03-21 18:33:58 cant show love when youon get nun from jump. done selling “affordable” oil paintings
2771 2018-03-21 18:33:49 Boko Haram stealing people. People blowing up oil refineries. Massive government corruption. Arsenal.

But scared of goats.
2772 2018-03-21 18:33:48 I love American oil memes
2773 2018-03-21 18:33:33 Just realized vintage Soviet oil paintings are the thing I most frequently almost impulse-buy for no reason, and then conscientiously back away from. *closes 4 Chrome tabs*
2774 2018-03-21 18:33:19 Democrats have co-opted this event in pursuit of power/votes. Daily protests in front of Sheriffs Dept/School Admin would prove otherwise
2775 2018-03-21 18:33:06 With most of the oil being sent off shore it won’t effect a thing. This is just being used as another excuse for the oil companies to jack prices and pocket even higher profits
2776 2018-03-21 18:33:04 HMV ( his masters voice ) and all those oil leases that Trump wants to get his hands on to  put him on the high table.
2777 2018-03-21 18:33:01 Powell : buradan oil shortlayip kendinizi sivrizeka mi saniyorsunuz

How much have dey make d nation lost in revenue dat has affected millions of Nigeria workers from not receiving salary which lead to many's death?
2781 2018-03-21 18:32:42 グランドカノニカル理解しましたやったー
2782 2018-03-21 18:32:21 I watched blue mountain state and found out what an oil change is and I’m mortified
2783 2018-03-21 18:32:15 *endorsed
2784 2018-03-21 18:32:14 Coconut oil is top ass.
2785 2018-03-21 18:31:57 coconut oil be having my skin lit 
2786 2018-03-21 18:31:55 A5 spinach - love to serve it with olive oil and garlic or with pasta  #gofurtherwithfvs
2787 2018-03-21 18:31:37 Don’t give up your dreams! Like Jon, I was 80% coverage at various points in my life. Could barely get out of bed in the winter, legs would crack and bleed because it was so dry. Top tip, castor oil in a warm bath. Soak a while. The oil penetrates pretty well and lasts a while.
2788 2018-03-21 18:31:27 Are we? We have the lowest unemployment I can ever remember; oil is a net export; stock market is up;our poorest citizens have smart phones; and our sewage does not run in the streets. We have problems, but I am sure it's not a shambles.
2789 2018-03-21 18:31:27 Lads I've mixed my ylang ylang essential oil with my bergamot essential oil and to be honest my aroma diffuser is kicking out some absolutely glorious smells
2790 2018-03-21 18:31:19 I was reading about lithium existing in old oil wells. This would serve as a source of lithium, and double as a means to rehabilate old wells. Lots of opportunity out there!
2791 2018-03-21 18:31:08 If SS will discover oil he will go on YouTube 100% like he did at HH, BB at this stage is a disaster imho. What was the point of dropping RNS today without any flow informations. Hope is still at HH, BB need to be side track but for that ukog needs permission and 2M to do the job
2792 2018-03-21 18:31:03 Just another use for superb Italian Olive Oil!
2793 2018-03-21 18:30:51 I'm about done with this f'ing sham of a "country".  It's basically mobsters holding a population together (hostage maybe?) with rigged elections, bath oil vodka, borscht and lies/propaganda 24x7 at this point.
2794 2018-03-21 18:30:48 I really wanna get one of those sucker thingies that pulls the oil & dirt stuff out of your blackheads. I just wanna go deep into skin care & have a whole setup  I really wanna try tati's vitamin too bc everyone's saying how great it is for their skin but idk if it's vegan :/
2795 2018-03-21 18:30:39 my skin has gotten so used to oil now when I use lotion it burns it 
2796 2018-03-21 18:30:35 They beg for gratitude because they know their “sacrifice” was for oil and they can’t live with that truth
2797 2018-03-21 18:30:28 So where's the oil fund to cover times of low oil revenue? Let's see your answer to that!
2798 2018-03-21 18:30:27 I hear big Arnold is offering free helicopter rides. they must be some new model that runs on used fryer oil.
2799 2018-03-21 18:30:25 OIL DIFF: 4.25 -> 4.45
2800 2018-03-21 18:30:16 Scrapping 4x4s: Our de-pollution process involves the removal of anti-freeze, brake fluids, motor oil and batteries.
2801 2018-03-21 18:30:15 Then why does gas and oil prices continue to go up!
2802 2018-03-21 18:30:12 Caster oil didn’t work with jack and just made me shit for hours and it it took three times to get it down 
2803 2018-03-21 18:30:11 Its always a double edged sword with Europeans in African wars. The French actually backed Biafra. Their aid air drops had ammo & petrol in them. Really they wanted to get their hands on the oil over the brits. The old "social justice" media backed biafra like it is anotha Isreal

2806 2018-03-21 18:30:06 1. Oil tight things that need to be loose.
2. Tighten the screws on the toilet seat.
3. Match up plastic bowls with kids and discard any that don't have one.
4. Eat all leftover holiday candy.

2810 2018-03-21 18:29:49 @T_Mason_H Hi Mason how can I find out who the crude oil exporters are? Thank you.
@mfmcg13
2811 2018-03-21 18:29:47 US oil production exceeds that of Saudi Arabia and nearly exceeds that of Russia.
2812 2018-03-21 18:29:41 So if they pulled oil out of the ground for free and gave it away, problem solved?
2813 2018-03-21 18:29:40 Pls what kinda equipments are they buying biko, will they be made of gold, diamond, silver, oil etc cos its not making sense
2814 2018-03-21 18:29:35 I am starved for some Lucas Oil racing...
2815 2018-03-21 18:29:31 i can’t wait until this semester is over, im going to get back into oil painting and stop being a sad binch 
2816 2018-03-21 18:29:28 Oil changed and a full tank of gas 
2817 2018-03-21 18:29:27 Com a volta do embargo ao oil do Irã, pelos EUA, saem do mercado 800kbpd. O brent vai, no curto prazo, se direcionar para os US$ 80.
2818 2018-03-21 18:29:03 honestly the only good thing about it constantly being like 87 degrees in my kitchen is that I never have to melt coconut oil
2819 2018-03-21 18:28:59 my normal oil change place is closed due to the windiness i guess and i’m annoyed.. man up ho’s
2820 2018-03-21 18:28:43 League 1... bahahahahahaha. Shows how much you know. Although that is where you would be rn if it wasn't for oil money
2821 2018-03-21 18:28:30 A brilliant illustration of why billionaires are definitively NOT saviors. The notions of wealth accumulation & doing “good” are akin to oil & water.
2822 2018-03-21 18:28:26 oil and gas industry in an awkward spot, harsh
2823 2018-03-21 18:28:25 between the amount of oil and the sheer size of it you could easily fry an egg on Sebastian Stan's forehead
2824 2018-03-21 18:28:22 Working towards making my passion  my full time job. I work in Health and Safety at a major oil company.
2825 2018-03-21 18:28:14 @Interior announces $125 million in high bids on 815K acres of the Gulf for oil and gas exploration
2826 2018-03-21 18:28:14 @pong32 ขอแสดงความเสียใจและเป็นกำลังใจให้นะคะนมและครอบครัวนะคะ คุณแม่ท่านยังไม่ได้จากไปไหนไกล ท่านยังยุ่ในใจของนมเสมอ ขออนุญาตร่วมทำบุญให้กับคุณแม่ท่านด้วยนะคะ  นมก็พักผ่อนบ้างนะคะ เป็นห่วงค่ะ ถ้าทานไรไม่ลงก็ต้องทาน ทานอาหารอ่อนหรือดื่มน้ำหวานไปก่อนก็ได้ค่ะ จะได้มีแรงต่อสู้นะคะนม
2827 2018-03-21 18:28:13 So I think this is the heart of the fossil fuel companies’ argument against causation: “The IPCC does not say it’s the extraction and production of oil,” the lawyer says. “It’s economic activity that creates the demand for energy and that leads to emissions.”
2828 2018-03-21 18:28:09 Lot 66: Engine Skips, Engine Oil Leak, Aerial Lift- 65 Foot Working Height, 10 Foot Debris Body
2829 2018-03-21 18:27:59 Hahaha eya sorry apply coconut oil morning and evening everyday
2830 2018-03-21 18:27:43 Unfortunate that slavery to greens will domino effect Alberta back conservative. Pipelines to BC cut off. No oil. BC election destroys the good.
2831 2018-03-21 18:27:31 It’s a lot of things, heating/cooling, they own convenience stores, asphalt/gravel, tanker truck division, they buy large quantities of oil/fuel, oil distributor etc.
2832 2018-03-21 18:27:28 The tarte maracuja oil or however you say it isn't that heavy! Have you looked up reviews or videos on oils? Also: I heard some like dermatologists say toner isn't that necessary if your face wash already has the stuff that balances you like a toner would.
2833 2018-03-21 18:27:17 Before getting all high n mighty about southern yokels, an aerospace engineer chained/ starved kids in CA. Bad people come in many forms.
2834 2018-03-21 18:27:15 Lawn mower serviced ( first oil change in 8 yrs), grass cut. Beer now in hand. First cut of the year, not the first beer.
2835 2018-03-21 18:27:11 Bullshit land thieves,  dirty oil pipelines killing all the life in the rivers and lakes how soulless you must feel.
2836 2018-03-21 18:27:07 It makes birds vulnerable to diseases like flu & malaria which can easily mutate & get transmitted to humans. It can lead to new pandemics of diseases to which we don't have effective drugs. Deepwater Horizon oil spill was disaster which is still affecting everything. Now this
2837 2018-03-21 18:27:04 How many girls have the militant kidnapped since they started? How many civilians have they bombed and how many have they killed or threatened to kill? So oil pipeline and human lives are the same to you?
2838 2018-03-21 18:26:51 Cut up some cauliflower, tossed it in some olive oil and roasted it until crispy. Sprinkled it with salt and now my toddler is eating it all up.

2839 2018-03-21 18:26:49 Just made some bomb ass split pea soup. My cooking skills are sharpening. Perhaps I’m getting ready to meet my husband. Learning what to do with cumin, seed oil, Paprika, thyme  and the “simmer” setting has been a serious game changer for my pallet as well as my chefin’ skills.
2840 2018-03-21 18:26:47 but did you try the olive oil!
2841 2018-03-21 18:26:47 I think you had me at the Spicy avacado toast.... Ok and maybe the olive oil fried eggs.
2842 2018-03-21 18:26:46 Africa's biggest economy & most populous Nigeria has developed cold feet and bowed of Africa free trade zone.
Trade unionsts fear one African market would bring Nigerian on its knees.
Nigeria is heavily dependent on crude oil, it's industrial sector is at infant stage
2843 2018-03-21 18:26:41 Where is the rns? Full of oil?
2844 2018-03-21 18:26:40 Enriched bleached wheat flour ... water, sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated vegetable and/or animal shortening (soybean, cottonseed and/or canola oil,beef fat), whole eggs, dextrose, 
 the eggs and beef fat sure -  the rest is a vegan conconction
2845 2018-03-21 18:26:32 So one of these babies is dipped in flour and oil, then in milk, then heavily breaded, then deep fried, and served with a mayo-based sauce—2.5 days worth of saturated fat in one tasty dish, what’s not to like? Plus it’s made by Aussies and they’re white people so it’s fine.

2848 2018-03-21 18:26:13 People who think coconut oil is healthy scare me
2849 2018-03-21 18:26:10 American oil memes is so fucking funny

2852 2018-03-21 18:25:47 Its pretty easy. And it comes with directions. You just add Eggs(2) ,milk(1 tin) and oil(1/2cup). Every other ingredient is optional.
2853 2018-03-21 18:25:33 @CarX_Man why are yall trying to pull a quick one on my homegirl? tried to charge her $400 to change some spark plugs? LOL and the manager lied over the phone about the price of an oil change by 40 bucks, we asked straight up.
2854 2018-03-21 18:25:27 Look forward to hearing real leadership speak to support of Alberta’s oil & gas sector tonight in Leduc @jkenney

2858 2018-03-21 18:25:07 Should we spend major money rebuilding our military? Let's compare it to your car. What if for 8 years in a row you spent no money on
- oil changes
- tuneups
- transmission service
And you used junkyard reclaimed parts for repairs

No choice left - must reinvest now.

2859 2018-03-21 18:24:29 Take away the fact that you obviously respect the office of the President. You’re not beholden to support @realDonaldTrump  just because he holds the office. You do realize he’s always been a snake oil salesman - How is “perjury” an unwarranted charge- We KNOW he will lie!
2860 2018-03-21 18:24:29 What this plonker means is "We are desperate enough to do and say anything which keeps you supplying gas and oil to the EU".

2863 2018-03-21 18:24:15 My goal after this PSAT was to take a nap. My mom wanted me to run errands. So I'm getting my oil changed.
2864 2018-03-21 18:24:15 Hahaha Congress ki असली ताकत देश के system में मौजूद उसके दल्ले हैं। जज, सरकारी वकील, आईएएस, आईआरएस अफसर, बाबू, पत्रकार वगैरह। इनको मारने के बाद ही कांग्रेस मरेगी @narendramodi @AmitShah @Swamy39 @manakgupta @girirajsinghbjp @sambitswaraj @RSSorg @BJP4India है बीजेपी में दम?
2865 2018-03-21 18:24:07 Exfoliate with a tomato 2/3x a week and use grapeseed oil (2-3drops) as your daily moisturizer alongsideyour sunscreen (it’s uncomfortable at first cause it feels like your skin is getting more oily,but ur skin starts producing less oil)
2866 2018-03-21 18:24:05 I've considered castor oil! I bought some my last pregnancy but chickened out because I was scared everyone said it tasted like shit and also made them shit all over while giving birth 
2867 2018-03-21 18:23:58 Modern Family, oil on canvas, 2018

2870 2018-03-21 18:23:20 My arteries started pumping extra blood looking at the butter gravy. I do make a really tasty Channa Chole without any oil.
2871 2018-03-21 18:23:07 Apple cider vinegar can be used for almost everything lol restoring ph, cleaning, detoxing, coconut oil and aloe vera are used to inhance hydration to wherever you apply but personally I don’t think their that great
2872 2018-03-21 18:23:06 Yeah I was thinking about getting the same piercing lol idk peppermint oil helps and cold and darkness but that’s all I’ve found so far
2873 2018-03-21 18:23:02 ....the oil
2874 2018-03-21 18:22:58 Yes ... U..xxx
2875 2018-03-21 18:22:55 I think that it would be better to switch to electric but I also think it would prove to be rather difficult given the role oil plays in many countries economies. #ActSlackHack1102

2877 2018-03-21 18:22:35 CAFE standards could've had an effect by then on petroleum as well as utilities moving away from oil for electricity. For nat gas, I'd expect home efficiency measures like insulation and some work on improved pipelines by gas companies could've mattered. But still a guess.
2878 2018-03-21 18:22:15 This is the only reason why we can subsidize renewables. Norway are the country in the world with the most electric cars in the world. And that's by far! It costs the country a fortune every year, and we couldn't do it without oil and gas development.
2879 2018-03-21 18:22:12 Best essential oil for migraines/headaches???? I'm willing to spend if it works!
2880 2018-03-21 18:22:05 If I was younger I’d move out of this country. It’s been hijacked by special interest groups. Greed has taken over. there is no peace. They r going back to drilling for oil and using coal for God’s sake! Racism and hate are very prevalent and gap between rich/poor out of control
2881 2018-03-21 18:22:04 Why would I want to send kids to die & waste tax dollars on a religious crusade? If that's the case then I wish we were there for the oil.
2882 2018-03-21 18:21:56 WHY COCONUT OIL ISNT ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU
2883 2018-03-21 18:21:46 Castor oil? I've heard differing opinions on it, just like any other "remedy"
2884 2018-03-21 18:21:45 get some orange oil it gets that shit off easy
2885 2018-03-21 18:21:38 I said they died for nothing but oil
2886 2018-03-21 18:21:14 It doesn't. It is one piece of a massive global puzzle. However, I do think that U.S. fossil fuel firms often seek to build coal and oil plants around the world themselves, which would be a contribution to somewhat reducing supply.
2887 2018-03-21 18:21:03 Petroleum jelly w/ cocoa butter and castor oil is life 
2888 2018-03-21 18:21:02 The problem there is economic colonization of nations has worked for Europe for centuries. When you live by greedy principles you leave in place a dead dictator and a desperate nation. Libya is the result of Europeans trying to control its oil.
2889 2018-03-21 18:20:56 There is no oil in the Horicon marsh in Wisconsin.  But there are Elk to hunt in northern WI now!
2890 2018-03-21 18:20:50 Yeah I’ve gotten my washing/moisturizing routine down pretty good. I need a better day time moisturizer though, the oil I use at night is too much for the day and the stuff I have now I just don’t love lol. I need a toner and spot treatment too
2891 2018-03-21 18:20:50 If you were burned by past investments in stocks, I don't blame you.. Many love playing the Gold, Oil markets. If it makes you satisfied and gives you solid good returns, all for it. Invest in what you know.

2906 2018-03-21 18:18:39 Oil meme is my kinda meme
2907 2018-03-21 18:18:31 Doubtful. I suspect they’re almost pure sugar, like cotton candy dust.
2908 2018-03-21 18:18:29 Coconut oil is a heat-safe fat and has a high smoke point, which means its great for cooking at medium and high heats. #DrFrank #HealthTips
2909 2018-03-21 18:18:16 Made a bet with my dad that I would grab the e-brake and slide around the corner while it was raining...in my brand new car. Ended up sliding into the curb, messing up my tire and poking a hole in my oil filter, leaving a trail of oil to my brothers house. #MyDumbBet

2912 2018-03-21 18:18:02 Can you imagine if Iraq or Saudi Arabia placed an oil embargo on the US during Reagan's administration? Ronald would've been saying the Middle East was a haven for 'evil empires' and that it's our 'moral duty' to obliterate it.
2913 2018-03-21 18:18:01 I started as a wannabe geologist...! Only kidding. I started at Lecturer grade, having worked in the oil industry for a little under 3 years.

2918 2018-03-21 18:17:36 I love that you already have $75, despite the suspension.
2919 2018-03-21 18:17:36 Nice pick up in energy issues today as people realize Oil is breaking out & squeezing. Still think it’s prudent to trail up stops. It can be squirrelly… I will discuss my thesis in today’s Mid-Week Video.
2920 2018-03-21 18:17:22 Thanks to tory MPS for burning the midnight oil to make these amendments
2921 2018-03-21 18:17:09 Gunmetal blue with the mane of blood red of innocents. A tail of trump hair yellow and oil drenched hooves from the gulf of Mexico.
2922 2018-03-21 18:17:08 Yeah, because oil =  regardless of the consequences 
2923 2018-03-21 18:17:06 Translation: we are running out of oil, pls give us weapons to further raid Yemen and steal their oil.
2924 2018-03-21 18:17:05 If oil breaks down lower, PMI data cools just a tad and you get one market sell off, look for an inversion this year as that would drive yields lower short term
2925 2018-03-21 18:17:02 Coconut oil mixed with brown sugar for your body na.

2929 2018-03-21 18:16:46 Pass. When people were “stacked” in the past, it was usually a bad thing.  I’ll rightfully identify as an animal.
2930 2018-03-21 18:16:38 Anytime I make a coconut oil sugar scrub I have the hardest time not eating it.
2931 2018-03-21 18:16:32 crude oil  did not move much after FOMC decision, but if dollar gets weaker (like it looks now) then energy can make another shot up soon
2932 2018-03-21 18:16:28 Use an exfoliating brush or tea tree oil
2933 2018-03-21 18:16:16 No surprise a lot of out of touch people in BC. They probably won’t like their premier so much when the oil tap gets shut off
2934 2018-03-21 18:16:04 I have to use 3 layers of moisture every evening. I use 2 during the day. Serum/oil, cream, cream.
2935 2018-03-21 18:15:54 So you are saying because our Pacific fleet was all harbored peacefully in Hawaii, and we placed an embargo on oil, we deserved to be attacked?

Like I said, "lost your mind".
2936 2018-03-21 18:15:35 Voted no. Not much context. But In theory this says courts ESTABLISH law and Counties enforce it. Do I misunderstand or those voting yes?
2937 2018-03-21 18:15:24 Sir what's happening with Tide water oil ? So week for a debt free co
2938 2018-03-21 18:15:19 The reasons are to destroy Iraq on behalf of Israel, geopolitics, oil and hate of Arabs and Muslims.
The Gross Domestic Product GDP in Iraq was 171.49 billion US dollars in 2016 
 والاقتصاد الأمريكي هو اكبر من اقتصاد العراق بحوالي ٩١ مرة هذا يوضح ان امريكا جائت لتدمير العراق
2939 2018-03-21 18:14:59 The industries in operation within the ECA zone in Mongla include four cement factories, one soybean oil refinery, one crude oil refinery, four cylinder gas companies, and one cigarette factory in the Mongla EPZ area,” said Hossain.
2940 2018-03-21 18:14:49 have you calculated how much the oil and gas industry get cause I got news for ya ... it's a helluva lot more than what you just claimed Tesla gets ... so I have to wonder ... are you this disingenuous about ALL your "beliefs"
2941 2018-03-21 18:14:47 I know it’s has in the garage but i think Tay said it need some damn oil i forgot
2942 2018-03-21 18:14:46 Breaking news: Jared Kushner allowed oil drilling in a college-educated toddler, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
2943 2018-03-21 18:14:35 Dad forgot to order oil so I just bought 50 tealights so it’s all good in the igloo household
2944 2018-03-21 18:14:33 I know from personal experience that Mormons are WAY into MLM schemes. Like if you go to Utah a TON of the SAHMs there are into ItWorks, some essential oil gigs, Beachbody, etc
2945 2018-03-21 18:14:31 The labels will probably products of the oil industry, including the paint itself. The production of the labels would need lots of oil products. That guy seems to have all his grey matter below his neck.
2946 2018-03-21 18:14:27 The companies argument is horrible. The reason that congress has encouraged oil and gas development is because of congresses greed and the oil companies lobby. It is so transparent I’m surprised judge needs the class on global warming to rule.

2948 2018-03-21 18:14:05 i appreciate the tone you took with this (gentle and not cynical… hard to carry off!) and it made me wonder about something that was totally the opposite… have you ever read Silicon Valley Snake Oil?
2949 2018-03-21 18:14:05 Capitalism breeds innovation or something tho right? Exactly why the oil industry needs so much intervention to keep going
2950 2018-03-21 18:14:00 I need a female friend I be wanting to go get manicures but don’t wanna walk in myself like “ Soft hand mask with aloe oil, natural coat manicure and can you round these off smoother?” Thank you Ming Ming
2951 2018-03-21 18:13:53 Doesn’t surprise me. Oil company scientists have be3n part of the mainstream for a long time. The main contrarians are libertarian free marketeers who object in principle to the policies accepting the science inevitably leads to.
2952 2018-03-21 18:13:28 Turmeric & ginger tea to reduce inflammation, Copaiba essential oil for the same reason, (it's primary constituent, beta-caryophyllene is an cannabidiol analog), & I also cut out sugar & limit carbohydrates to 20g per day to reduce inflammation & reap ketosis benefits.
2953 2018-03-21 18:13:26 Well remember the oil blockages in the early 2000s that brought Blair to his senses. Well I suggest you get all the fishing boats and other boats you can and sail up the Thames and blockade it, right outside parliament, until you get justice!
2954 2018-03-21 18:13:17 Containing the Shock Waves from #Venezuela
Why did it happen?  Lower oil prices, corruption & mismanagement have devastated the economy. A deeply unpopular government, aware that it can no longer win competitive elections, has opted for repression.
2955 2018-03-21 18:13:08 You're a bot. Now you're blocked.
2956 2018-03-21 18:12:59 One thing that was positive from this was the amount of contributions from Dawn Soap to help these animals. People really came together to support the health of the animals and Dawn Soap is still supportive of those animals affected by the oil spill.
2957 2018-03-21 18:12:45 Remember Niger/Delta militancy? A lot of smaller groups sprang up when kidnapping of expats & oil workers became business. Even local politicians profited, and grew in their politics, for being hostage negotiators.
2958 2018-03-21 18:12:34 Jimbo’s tool man.  What you are.
2959 2018-03-21 18:12:32 If oil keeps this up, we are going to hear more inflation talk out of #ECB hawks. Europe inflation is basically a combo of US core CPI plus oil in EUR terms.
2960 2018-03-21 18:12:24 Michael B. Jordan. will see you that pizza on a oil stained paper plate and lick the sauce from the corner of your mouth.

the thrist gods have spoken
2961 2018-03-21 18:11:59 Big shame. One of the excuses raised by officials is that outside the oil trading market, Nigeria will face negative competition!
2962 2018-03-21 18:11:57 Charlie is my problem pup... her lips are getting even more chapped and shes beem itchy lately.

2966 2018-03-21 18:11:35 accidentally got olive oil in my eyes earlier (don’t ask) and I’ve spent the entire shift just looking as if I have a nervous twitch ffs
2967 2018-03-21 18:11:33 Factor: Russia and US will be dominating oil exports to China, as US production increases, and Saudi’s move away from oil economy. Putin &Trump have a close relationship. Russia economy is based on oil and gas exports. Russia has pipelines in place. Black Sea oil reserves. Gouge?

2971 2018-03-21 18:11:01 Like I said; Black people don't mean anything to you, that's why. AmeriKKKa and capitalist countries you look up to have done worse to people. Korea is not attacking countries for their oil, the USSR never went to another country and killed off the natives.
2972 2018-03-21 18:10:59 ladies, love urself and stop clogging your pores with coconut oil
2973 2018-03-21 18:10:55 I met Carlos in the bar at 40th birthday - other then not drinking oil, I must report a perfect likeness...

2977 2018-03-21 18:10:30 See, I keep asking myself why I go here when I can easily go to Costco and pay half the price & have a shorter wait time. Lol. Because its not like I'm getting superior service at the dealership. Why am I waiting 2 & a half hours for an oil change?
2978 2018-03-21 18:10:29 How do I STILL have coconut oil in my ass

#10:  Oil Production Skyrockets – “A new report from The Washington Post says that oil production in the United States ‘is flirting with record highs heading into the new year,’ due to shale technology and ‘the oil-friendly Trump administration.’
2981 2018-03-21 18:10:20 Good God! The trouble in the ME is not from oil. Oil is the mechinism by which Islam funds their goals of conquest. The problem in the ME is that they are dominated by radical Islam. Islam has ALWAYS been a militaristic blueprint for conquest. It will only stop when confronted.

2988 2018-03-21 18:10:00 I was making a joke about the fact that Chiarelli likes to trade picks and skilled players and that the Oil Kings are owned by the Oilers and so exercising a bit of comic license in leaping from one franchise to another.

Using that money to buy weapons from USA?
Judging from the body language of The Crown Prince, I don´t think so.
Next is selling Oil in Chinese Currency, and good bye Petro Dollar.
Before then, attack on Syria.

3015 2018-03-21 18:06:47 The Japanese only attacked because the entire US naval fleet was placed in Pearl Harbor, the perfect place to stage an invasion of Japan. Had the roles been reversed you'd have called it a "pre-emptive strike". Additionally, the US had placed an oil embargo on Japan-

3018 2018-03-21 18:06:29 I have conducted a reseach about Tunisian olive oil in the region of Sfax. Olive cultures are organic at 99%. The process flow is almost the same since hundreds of years. The taste is amazing and fruity. Conclusion:  Tunisian #oliveoil is the best !

3019 2018-03-21 18:06:28 It is not. We've got such a limited amount of that distressed cedar that we save what we have to replace slats that need it at the Chicken or Chicken Oil.

Of course they hire lobbyists like many billion dollar industries do. They hire them in many countries. The US NGO's only protest Canadian Oil. Not US, Not Middle East, Not Anyone Else
Why just us?

3035 2018-03-21 18:04:01 I wrote about how our world is becoming increasingly electric. The article discusses the benefits of this but also the obstacles we will face when switching from oil to electric energy. #ActSlackHack1102

Oklahoma is happy to be rid of him. We don't want him back. We wish you would stop allowing his trips here.

3061 2018-03-21 18:00:42 It was cancelled twice as section of canal was closed because of an oil spill. It's open now and happening on Saturday.
3062 2018-03-21 18:00:28 I love it! It is SOOOO gentle. Used the oil last night; cleanser, toner & moisturiser this morning & noticed a real difference in my skin - def. not as red (rosacea). Ordered full size cleanser from you today

3077 2018-03-21 17:59:47 Shit, I didn’t see this coming. I should drink olive oil for increased perception.

3082 2018-03-21 17:57:58 It's so incredibly disingenuous to say that #RightToTry allows "snake oil salesmen" to take advantage of patients. These are medicines in #FDA clinical trials!

3094 2018-03-21 17:56:37 Someone wanna change the oil in the legacy for me. Im feeling lazy and dont want to do it but im also too poor to pay a shop to do it

3096 2018-03-21 17:56:27 How about just ENFORCING laws we have now? 
The supposed smartest people in the country can't figure this out, and I can?
3097 2018-03-21 17:56:26 Logic is that oil companies won't perform the basic capitulation to the new paradigm of climate science because too powerful because politicians are paid by their lobbyists, but you want them to be nationalized by the politicians who are being paid by their lobbyists because....?

3101 2018-03-21 17:56:13 I know it makes me so sad, oil spills have harmed or killed around 82,000 birds, 6000 turtles and 25,000 marine mammals #Lesson10
3102 2018-03-21 17:56:09 Everybody thought they were crazy. Now everybody's putting a turbo on everything! Oil has gotten a touch better too, fortunately.
3103 2018-03-21 17:56:07 Damn. It’s not even 11 yet and I’ve already. Got a oil change. Washed my car for the first time since 2014. Got my brother his bday gift finally. Cut my hair and got lunch. That was a productive ass morning.
3104 2018-03-21 17:56:03 Winter drys my skin out ! I need to sit in coconut oil 
3105 2018-03-21 17:56:02 Good point. The people in Abia, Onitsha and Nnewi need to do more lobbying to get their voices heard in the corridors of power. As it is, we only hear from the Dangotes and Oil bosses when time for political support approaches. Nigeria is a big country and its interests vary!
3106 2018-03-21 17:55:54 That's my cup of crude oil!
3107 2018-03-21 17:55:54 We werent as conected as we are then, also, mentalities change, there's a reason why snake oil with marijuana is not sold anymore

3110 2018-03-21 17:55:46 The Russian economy stagnates at low oil prices. They interfered in Ukraine, prompting EU sanctions .They influenced the US presidential election via Cambridge Analytica,Farage & Israel in favour of Trump. They now want to hive UK from EU by supporting BREXIT. STOP @CostOfBrexit
3111 2018-03-21 17:55:44 Also, seems like I heard there was more chloesterol in coconut oil than in butter. Good vegan alternative tho, I guess.

3113 2018-03-21 17:55:40 The unfunny version of Arthur Daley in British politics. 19th century America saw these people as carpetbaggers, film-flam artists and snake oil salesman. No difference in my eyes
3114 2018-03-21 17:55:38 If you're not old enough to remember the Iraq invasion for oil, it is important to research the lies used to make it happen, how the newspapers beat the drums for war, LIED to everyone...so you can recognize it as they do it AGAIN and AGAIN.
3115 2018-03-21 17:55:34 THAT STUPID GULF OIL SIGN SHOULD BE WATCHING THE GAME HAS MORE POWER THAN THE RANGERS OFFENSE TOO
3116 2018-03-21 17:55:31 Still staying long Tqqq, Labu and Erx...Iran oil fails price goes higher
3117 2018-03-21 17:55:25 No mention of the 2mm barrels of crude oil that was needed to supplement the shortfall of Russian LNG. Not to mention the ever increasing utility cost passed along to the consumer.
3118 2018-03-21 17:55:20 That rub you down in coconut oil type of love.
3119 2018-03-21 17:55:18 No one read the manual back then that told you to idle the car for 5 minutes before shutting the engine off to prevent oil starvation of the turbo’s bearings.  Remember when Chrysler put a turbo on everything?
3120 2018-03-21 17:54:53 Judge and Chevron attorney seem to establish that since 1951, it’s been accepted that CO2 has a warming effect. Oil company attorney isn’t great at answering judge’s science questions; does it matter? Hard to say. #climatetutorial
3121 2018-03-21 17:54:46 Their tact is not arguing the science, but rather claiming that 1) its a collective action problem and people burning oil are as responsible as those producing and 2) science was more uncertain before 1990 and you can't blame oil companies as much back then.
3122 2018-03-21 17:54:44 Question : Them no dey mix bleaching oil with vaseline?

3123 2018-03-21 17:54:43 A state-owned oil company in the United Arab Emirates continued to hand out stakes in offshore production areas, this time to Chinese partners.
3124 2018-03-21 17:54:42 is it the olive oil?
3125 2018-03-21 17:54:33 #Protip: After using whatever product it is that you use to clean your face, apply an oil free moisturizer to prevent over-production of your natural oils, which may lead to break outs.

3138 2018-03-21 17:53:10 See @anasalhajji for some interesting and good perspectives on EVs.

3164 2018-03-21 17:49:59 How about stop importing 600,000 barrels of foreign a day when a east pipeline would allow to use Canadian oil instead, jobs and revenue to Canadian companies and government and investment.

3166 2018-03-21 17:49:50 I do think if we hit $100-110 next year, it may coincide nicely with EV cars gaining a lot of market share. Oil then collapsing down and staying down for a long time will break a lot of these petrostates.

3171 2018-03-21 17:49:21 If the head of BP was to be believed, Benn was instrumental in the foundation of the North Sea oil industry in the late 70s.
3172 2018-03-21 17:49:19 Explain Why the oil meme/hype i need Something better then behind the meme
3173 2018-03-21 17:49:17 And get your oil Ray you horror
3174 2018-03-21 17:49:02 It's sad that the so called leader's haven't subsidised the eco replacements nor invested in any clean fuel or batteries that can replace our need for oil soon enough for us not to be in a position where life itself is in danger! Blind Greed is the biggest killer #pollution
3175 2018-03-21 17:49:01 You've got oil on your nose.
3176 2018-03-21 17:48:54 California’s economy (if it were an independent country) just rose to number six in the world. Unlike the failing economies in Kansas and other states where right wing snake oil have been adopted as policy...
3177 2018-03-21 17:48:49 My day has been made with #US targets South Sudan oil sector, ministries over civil war
I hope the booming economy referred to by #Ezekiel Lol would slow down abit.  Thank you #UnitedStates 4 answering the cry of the voiceless.  South Sudan is not for greedy folks
3178 2018-03-21 17:48:44 Break the glass, grab the pressurized canister of Patchouli oil, and spray like it's 1975 and the Dead are doing a week at the Pauley Pavilion1
3179 2018-03-21 17:48:40 Y'all....it costs $60 to change the oil in my baby but $35 if I buy my own oil . $60 !!!!! I had 5 years worth of free oil changes back home now I gotta pay lol . I'm hurt !
3180 2018-03-21 17:48:39 free oil changes on me
3181 2018-03-21 17:48:24 Castor oil
3182 2018-03-21 17:48:20 Sweden as well. Just paints migrants badly, rightfully so. Being honest gets you marked , worse thn terrorist. They welcome them back
3183 2018-03-21 17:48:15 I'm surprised the US hasn't invaded my face at the end of the day bc there's hella oil there
3184 2018-03-21 17:48:08 Ok so try this one,as a kid I was allowed to wander in the Bush and would stray into Hausa/Fulani villages who always welcomed a 7 year old and fed me. Garri & Snake or Garri & King Rat..Garri is mashed Cassava root served with a meat sauce with peppers.(rat or snake) & palm oil.
3185 2018-03-21 17:47:30 Disappointed that I am unable to get a response from @CertasBusiness for a delivery date for oil for my elderly parents who have had no heating since Sunday night
3186 2018-03-21 17:47:27 Honey and tea!!  Eucalyptus oil in your shower
3187 2018-03-21 17:47:25 I’d like to add the portion of the worlds oceans that are actively drilled for oil and natural gas to that. That’d be an ugly map.
3188 2018-03-21 17:47:18 Are you one of them? We're on the coast w/ our tourism & fishing industries threatened. No, I won't sacrifice our environment & American jobs, so oil barons can sell oil overseas & make more money.
3189 2018-03-21 17:47:13 The single cheapest sector in the world,  except for uranium,  has to be Canadian energy -- due to the interprovincial disputes and lack of pipeline capacity.  Essentially they are now a massive perpetual call option on oil,  with a $40 strike price.
3190 2018-03-21 17:47:05 || and i fucking scalded my hand with hot oil

fuck me
3191 2018-03-21 17:46:53 Prayers that he hasn’t  been bought and paid for by the big oil companies like the Republicans have been.  
Republican greed is how our Country is dying. #HowDemocracyDies
3192 2018-03-21 17:46:51 Hello Inquisitor, we have redeveloped our bars by reducing the coconut oil to less than 3gms per bar. We are of course Get Fruity so the juicy fruit will always be a main ingredient in our bars. What would you add instead of fruit?
3193 2018-03-21 17:46:46 Getting an oil change and I always have to get something new

:-)
3195 2018-03-21 17:46:37 BBC TRIED THEIR BEST last night to put a negative slant on how the oil sector is recovering, this announcement is probably what they were trying to counter.
3196 2018-03-21 17:46:33 In zalmi walon ko b nahi pata ho ga in k ghar py kon sa oil use hota hai  #boleDilKiBoliyan #KKvPZ
3197 2018-03-21 17:46:29 Yeah, after being in OR I literally refuse to pay more than $30 for a gram of oil and that’s not even a thing here. $50 is the cheapest
3198 2018-03-21 17:46:17 And Big leaks from Big Oil rigs will mean more cleanups, pollution of fishing groups, disruption of beaches for vacationers - BIG WIN for BIG OIL. 
Lots less for real people!
3199 2018-03-21 17:45:59 HAHAHAHAHAHA PAKTAY NA  GUSTO KO NGA MAGLUTO NG HOTDOG AT ITLOG KASO WALANG COOKING OIL IT MEANS MATULOG NA KO KESA LAMON AKO NG LAMON
3200 2018-03-21 17:45:54 yeah, it’s pretty scary when this is the supposed savior to give cheap oil forever.
3201 2018-03-21 17:45:44 Vendors of snake oil. Definitely not dangerous tech geniuses.
3202 2018-03-21 17:45:37 Folks, I'm not a socialist at all. But Venezuela's continued hardships are not just because of socialism. The Globalist bankers and international crime syndicates, including our own gov . Is strangling those ppl to control the oil and wealth.
3203 2018-03-21 17:45:16 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this March? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
3204 2018-03-21 17:45:15 Not Congo and Gabon. More like Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria. Besides, our major African exports are oil and gas, films, and music. How will our abstention affect those negatively?

As I said elsewhere, we need to get our sh*t together. Power, ease of doing business etc.
3205 2018-03-21 17:45:05 Fine 
We were just discussing in the office low status of Engineers in UK and how things have been slow since credit and oil crash etc.
3206 2018-03-21 17:44:58 Perfectly stated. And we have to identify the politics behind the machines they own (oil and many commerce structures) and decide to stop financing them. They are NOTHING without our dollars recycling back to them. If that stops-- their war stops.
3207 2018-03-21 17:44:52 Climate change greatest mind was wrong. Climate is caused by the stuff we can not control. We can control pollution with proper regulations and education !! Bottom line every single Canadian is dependent on Oil. It’s not great but it’s our reality. We need oil to live...
3208 2018-03-21 17:44:48 Nails and eyebrows done, feel so much better. Chill out with a few gins and a head full of coconut oil. I need to get a life
3209 2018-03-21 17:44:44 True true. I honestly kinda still prefer oil but it’s just harder to find good oil over here plus it’s overpriced.
3210 2018-03-21 17:44:36 These folks even sure we got oil. But seriously....it only makes sense man. But that is why it won't ever happen.
3211 2018-03-21 17:44:36 oil on canvas, 2018
3212 2018-03-21 17:44:35 Sup?  You bears still taking a beating looking for more.  Cause we’ve got more for ya.
3213 2018-03-21 17:44:32 ตัวมึงเองไม่ชอบอะไรก็อย่าไปทำแบบนั้นกับคนอื่น เริ่มเยอะละอห.!!
3214 2018-03-21 17:44:15 Yes. I use the whole Acteen range. The face scrub and the moisturiser. I think 2 weeks is long enough. I have oily skin and within a week my skin's oil production had reduced and after 2 weeks my skin started to clear. If you're not seeing results yet you should change.
3215 2018-03-21 17:44:08 Middle East oil is owned by ME countries. We have advisors and workers over there but not so much as in the early days of oil. 
Federal lands belong to the people and allowing oil companies to go on and drill helps the people. 
It is unfortunate our oil is part of World market.
3216 2018-03-21 17:43:54 Teach the world facts and give Saudi their oil back
3217 2018-03-21 17:43:53 Every time I bring my car into the dealership, someone’s tryna get me to look at a new car. Nigga, can I get my oil changed in peace. Dang! 
3218 2018-03-21 17:43:49 my sweet

3219 2018-03-21 17:43:39 Grah, that's a good idea! Some kind of oil I have to carefully apply with gloves, turning anything applied into sweets.

That sounds really addicting actually. Turning old clothes or friends made clothes into tasty food. <3

3221 2018-03-21 17:43:24 We smoked blunts all the time lmao
There was just a point when we started only buying oil
Like when u moved here

3223 2018-03-21 17:43:18 Thanks to inside-the-courtroom tweets from @amywestervelt @SavorTooth and many more, it seems #climateliability defendants accept science basics but push uncertainty. Sure, Big Oil's scientists acknowledged uncertainty, but #ExxonKnew the climate science consensus in the 1970s.
3224 2018-03-21 17:43:14 Babies usually smell like that fake baby powder stuff. My baby smells like lavender and chamomile from the baby oil(grape seed) i infused for her. I didn’t add any essential oils to it but it smells amazing.
3225 2018-03-21 17:43:06 Saudi Arabia is broke. We need lower oil prices. Islam,
the political system, can now wither like a weed with no water.
3226 2018-03-21 17:42:49 Worldwide oil Production is a little more complex then analyzing known daily us domestic natgas production. It’s not even the same sport.
3227 2018-03-21 17:42:24 you can get canabis oil in holland and barret now legally
3228 2018-03-21 17:42:20 Carpenter, plumbers, catering, cleaners, estate agents, interiors decorators, fashion designers, insurance agent, oil and gas companies etc

3230 2018-03-21 17:42:19 I’m already subscribed to 3 different services like this, well two now, I canceled motortrend it had no content.  I subscribe to Lucas oil tv, and V8 Superview for V8 Supercars.
3231 2018-03-21 17:42:05 the oil rig and gulag missions and nothing else
3232 2018-03-21 17:41:59 I assume you mean retarded, I see what I’m dealing with when you use that word. Okay, I’ve not seen any reports on anyone starving, your vile country just want it’s oil, end of. Like the catalyst of all your invasions in the last 50 years.
3233 2018-03-21 17:41:53 Obama spied on journalists, even jailed them.

3235 2018-03-21 17:41:47 My favorite new anti-pipeline slogan is #DefendtheWater
Which is hilarious on 3 levels:
1. If you know anything about oil transportation, this should really be a PRO-pipeline slogan.
3236 2018-03-21 17:41:43 Today @washingtonpost is again hammering EPA Administrator for newly revealed travel costs (requested by Chm. Gowdy of House Oversight) of nearly $68,000 in past 7 mos., e.g. $3200 ticket for 1-day trip to MS, $3600 to address TX Oil & Gas Ass'n

3238 2018-03-21 17:41:32 According to Isaiah 61:2-3 Jesus was anointed by the Father to comfort all who mourn, to console those who mourn to give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called oaks of righteousness. #love
3239 2018-03-21 17:41:27 Then we'd just import more oil, lol. Canada would expand tar sand exploitation, and more $ would go to state owned oil companies in autocratic countries.

Solutions need to be demand-side focused as well.
3240 2018-03-21 17:41:19 throw every oil company geologist/geophysicist in a gulag
3241 2018-03-21 17:41:13 Yes oil is gaining the price at the pump has jumped hurting my bottom line.
3242 2018-03-21 17:41:11 @MarcGarneau Which is potentially more dangerous to the environment, Moving oil by train or pipeline?

3247 2018-03-21 17:40:21 You gotta do some coconut oil scalp treatment, feels as good as it sounds and it  really helps
3248 2018-03-21 17:40:20 See? It is possible to make money in American oil production and sales.

3250 2018-03-21 17:40:14 @CarolineHirons Hi Caroline, I keep on seeing different things everywhere regarding oil or moisturiser first. I only ever trust your opinion so what would you do? Currently I use oil before moisturiser. Is that right?
3251 2018-03-21 17:40:13 i just need my freaking oil changed but mfs want me to wait 2 and a half hours like tf keisha
3252 2018-03-21 17:40:06 Thanks for the recommendation and great to hear you're enjoying using our oil in your baking 
3253 2018-03-21 17:40:01 also i stopped reading edawn's part at "oil" and was like ?????

3255 2018-03-21 17:39:46 When you looking for oil you have to explore all the holes.
3256 2018-03-21 17:39:39 thanks chad, i did NOT know fennel oil is good for lactation but thanks for sharing that really weird fact in an attempt to be flirty, please buy your soap and leave

3258 2018-03-21 17:39:25 ....
4. Money made from oil was put back into the citizens
5. Literacy rate was very high under his rule as education became free

Get your facts straight
3259 2018-03-21 17:39:22 Further to owning the 1st overall pick in the bantam draft, the Oil Kings also own Everett's 1st round pick (Aaron Irving trade). While that will be a late pick, they do have 3 of the top 23 picks in May.
3260 2018-03-21 17:39:21 apple cider vinegar is great. and oregano oil. dont taste great but they work. essential oils are really good.

3262 2018-03-21 17:39:09 Kak iman, is this the correct order? 

Night routine(exfoliate 2,3xweekly) : Oil cleanser. Cleanser. AHA/BHA hada labo. Vit c serum. Toner. Clay mask. Moisturizer/Sleeping mask.
3263 2018-03-21 17:39:07 I have 11.5 hours to make my daughters wish come true of becoming a big sister today... who has some castor oil?!

3268 2018-03-21 17:38:15 So I see the Chinese are targeting soybeans in a trade war revenge.  Sounds like to that branstad is screwing up his ambassador job too.  I thought they were buddies.  Get to work.  Our beans are inferior to others with respect to oil %

3272 2018-03-21 17:37:42 Juan just made a gooooood a$$ point. 

They always arresting people for marijuana fields in Grand Bahama. Why not just legalize it over there and make $$ instead of waiting on this oil refinery.

3276 2018-03-21 17:37:21 There are no American oil companies; they're all global. If we're not in the Mid East for the oil what are we doing there?

3308 2018-03-21 17:33:55 Finna slap this vitamin e oil on my face wishing it was pussy juice 
3309 2018-03-21 17:33:50 Yeah he sounds like a pretty special player. Although I can't imagine the Oil Kings would want to be in the position again next year!
3310 2018-03-21 17:33:44 Doubtless tasty but coconut oil is 87% saturated fat. These are 10% coconut oil, so the saturated fat content will be high. Concentrated fruit sugars are still sugar, refined or not.
3311 2018-03-21 17:33:29 dreading going to get this oil change, that synthetic blend be so expensive 
! 
3312 2018-03-21 17:33:25 ShaMaran Announces Payment for Atrush Oil Deliveries OMX:SNM) reports that TAQA Atrush BV, Operator of the Atrush Block, has received USD 17.5 million on behalf of the Atrush co-venturers from the Kurdistan Regional Government as payment for Dec 2017 crude oil deliveries #OOTT
3313 2018-03-21 17:33:23 #ukog #swampys there is no bad news . Waiting for #Broadfordbridge results still . Nothing has changed .#Horsehill producers lots of crude oil to and you know it. Hang around and watch it Gush with me  :)
3314 2018-03-21 17:33:17 So my guy stopped to buy oil for his generator and then the car wouldn't start anymore. A "rewire" comes along to help. After a quick inspection, rewire decides to get some tolls from his shop across the road.
BOOM!
He and and a bikeman are knocked down by a convoy.
3315 2018-03-21 17:33:13 Got all the stuff ready to make my shrimp rolls & Boom I’m outta oil  let me call dirk
3316 2018-03-21 17:33:09 Nationalization doesn't prevent Financial incentives to keep it going. Just look at what happened in Brazil, public oil company was still bribing all the politicians.

Government needs to ban fossil fuel extraction.
3317 2018-03-21 17:33:05 Primrose oil, topically applied, in my experience.
3318 2018-03-21 17:32:57 My hair smells good for the summer I  only use peppermint oil in my hair mixed with other essential oils but peppermint smells so good
3319 2018-03-21 17:32:50 yes its wonderful as a night oil, as are most oils!  A few drops massaged into the skin overnight will do wonders!

3324 2018-03-21 17:32:33 Whale......oil.......beef.......hooked.....
3325 2018-03-21 17:32:20 2/2 Is he setting stage for argument for collective responsibility for climate change, rather than actions of oil companies?
3326 2018-03-21 17:32:03 I just installed solar so I would use less gas and oil. Because I’m a real Energy Citizen, not a corporate lobbying company.
3327 2018-03-21 17:32:03 Why are people shocked about #Facebook and the use of personal data? There whole business model is based on having our data... same goes for #twitter or any social media company! #data is the new #oil #gold #ItMakesMoney
3328 2018-03-21 17:31:52 Nae oil painting eh 
3329 2018-03-21 17:31:41 How cool! I am following everyone on here

3332 2018-03-21 17:31:26 The weed is already rolled in it... the oil I just put under my tongue
3333 2018-03-21 17:31:18 Doesn’t he brag about his personal 2nd Amendment arsenal? Let the NRA and the corrupt oil and gas leasing companies pay for his security. #PayItBack
3334 2018-03-21 17:31:07 Oh yaa? Aku tuh bingung dehh sebenernya fungsi face oil buat apasii? Kalo kulitku berminyak perlu pake gaa?._.

3336 2018-03-21 17:30:55 
You won't return it keh

3337 2018-03-21 17:30:43 over you I’m GREASED UP .. like a bottle of oil sheen and I ain’t got shit to LEAN MY HEAD ON BUT MY FUCKING SHOULDERS
3338 2018-03-21 17:30:25 you probably are having it when it's cooked too long-- if it tastes bitter, it's overdone. dress it up with some garlic and wilt it in grapeseed or olive oil my dude and serve it like literally JUST after it wilts it'll taste so much better.
3339 2018-03-21 17:30:18 I LOVE mincing my oem fresh garlic. Sometimes when I buy too much I spend time mincing garlic and putting in oil to infuse the oil and use the garlic later.
 And at least I know how long my garlic had been on that oil.
3340 2018-03-21 17:30:15 Oil tankers? U know it! Coal Barges too. Let me know when you build a mass movement on the coal thing....Ill retweet ya
3341 2018-03-21 17:30:14 OIL DIFF: 4.22 -> 4.26
3342 2018-03-21 17:30:10 Tried 649 attempts at a selfie that is semi ok and I got one good one of the ceiling. 
The coconut oil is to blame.
3343 2018-03-21 17:30:00 When oil tanks, my city, Lafayette, becomes a ghost town.  Oil may rally, but I'm afraid it will never boom again.  We really need to diversity our economy to stop the cycles of boom and bust that throw Louisiana families into turmoil.
3344 2018-03-21 17:29:57 What a plan!!
3345 2018-03-21 17:29:39 Same with #Chemicals, most of #Pharma & big #Oil!
3346 2018-03-21 17:29:37 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Post impressionist oil painting of apples. Art Demonstration by Mark Briscoe" à l'adresse
3347 2018-03-21 17:29:31 Yes we have to check carefully and stop buying products with palm oil and tell those companies that use it to find alternatives that don’t destroy rainforests.

3349 2018-03-21 17:29:20 Favorite quote of the day comes from a friend not on social media: "@facebook doesn't realize that it's Exxon, and the Valdez has crashed and is dumping oil in a pristine Alaskan bay."
3350 2018-03-21 17:29:07 only CBD oil or osmething edible.. not a fucking joint.. lets be real.. Ive been smoking for the past 18 years... it aint for kids.
3351 2018-03-21 17:29:03 a gentle request for anyone who makes natural peanut butter: can we get a LITTLE more space at the top, please? who can stir that without getting peanutty oil everywhere.
3352 2018-03-21 17:28:53 I Will be going to Oklahoma. The Law is Wrong; Oil was not "Given by god", and they also claim the world is only 5000 years old, and oil comes from vegetation, not dinasaurs.  1 Million Dollar Fine? 10 years  YEARS in Prison - for saving thier Water?  NO. #NotOK.
3353 2018-03-21 17:28:45 @jkenney why does @JustinTrudeau put so much support behind steal and aluminium manufacture when it is as “dirty” as oil and gas is supposed to be? Have you ever seen a S&A plant and what they spew out. Maybe it is because O&G is in the west. #justinmustgo

3356 2018-03-21 17:28:20 Leaving out how many gallons of oil that were burned to supplement the shortage of LNG. Was that an accident or lack of understanding?

3359 2018-03-21 17:28:10 Thanks so much for the reply! I was actually referring to trading Crude Oil vs trading the EMini Crude Oil. When I look at the contract specs if I am reading it correctly, it seems that the Emini Crude is a higher per/tick value.

3361 2018-03-21 17:27:30 While I applaud the generosity, but I cringe knowing that academics do not receive the same altruistic support, nor do the schools benifit from predictable, dependable funding for salary, operation, equipment. Oklahoma fails its children by refusal to appropriately tax oil/gas co
3362 2018-03-21 17:27:25 @PatrickW Interesting article on the middle class disappearing in the 2020s I agree but for different reasons. Our society is built upon the edifice of cheap oil & easy credit, the disappearance of both will collapse us into ordinary poverty for almost everyone @AutomaticEarth

3364 2018-03-21 17:26:52 The puck is going to more cars, to cheaper cars, to more people wanting to live a good life. EVs not ready for prime time by 2030. Far too expensive & range constrained. Peak oil likely 2050 at best. Growing Asia doesn’t give a hoot where it buys its oil. The only loser is Canada
3365 2018-03-21 17:26:42 I'm not as of yet. You hear different things about players, but the Euro draft is still old school. That being said I can't imagine the Oil Kings would have too much trouble convincing a player to come over. Their location and state of the art facilities are a big selling point.
3366 2018-03-21 17:26:39 #USDCAD help me understand why the CAD is out performing the $ on the day we are 100% guaranteed to raise rates, besides oil being up today, how is it possible that this is happening?? Where is the logic
3367 2018-03-21 17:26:31 An oil and tar ball shoved in a pile of coal, doused with a tanker of jet fuel and set aflame....as a back up grid.
3368 2018-03-21 17:26:28 The Russian steel ones hear they are the best ones.  After all they did send us those pipes for oil pipe line.   Just wonder if they leak could get a little messy.
3369 2018-03-21 17:26:27 White liberals are the malignant tumor of the world. They hate their white color so much that black shoe oil might be useful some day!

3372 2018-03-21 17:26:02 Oil Prices hit a six-week high after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and as concern persisted over possible disruption to Middle East supply.

3376 2018-03-21 17:25:27 Clean air, great living standards, un polluted rivers, high wages. California is the 6th largest economy in the world. Let's see what Trump is coming to screw up now. Shrinking our National monuments and parks. Wants to drill for oil on the coast.He will  screw up environment .
3377 2018-03-21 17:25:19 มันก็เป็นแค่ภาพที่ทำให้กลับมาเป็นเหมือนเดิมไม่ได้
3378 2018-03-21 17:25:17 If I go around telling people to murder someone, then someone listens and goes and murders the person, am I liable in any way or is that free speech? That seems pretty analogous to what oil companies have done; "keep buying oil, we know it will kill people but keep buying!"
3379 2018-03-21 17:25:11 Dinosaurs and Plants Thrived for 150million years,  in a 1600-4000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 350ppm. Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice, until just 10,000 years ago. Yes, we have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us.

3382 2018-03-21 17:24:48 Same re: dehydration before base, but the biggest difference for me with peeling was swapping from oil pens 100% to cuticle cream half the time. All that liquidy hydration was getting under the polish.
3383 2018-03-21 17:24:47 London’s bluechip index spent most of the day in the red hovering just above the 7000 mark until mining shares and oil stocks lifted the index higher in a late surge. The UK100 finished only slightly lower at 7039 down just 22 points.

3385 2018-03-21 17:24:45 i hate it when online shops transfer castor oil to cutesy little bottles and sell it for 100+ pesos when its LITERALLY the same as the castor oil being sold for 30-40 pesos in drugstores. MGA KAPITALISTA!!!

3402 2018-03-21 17:23:14 You mean why trade oil compared to es?  Really what you trade depends on what kind of trader you are.  If both instruments moved the same amount every day then yes it would make more sense to trade the ES.  Oil tends to be more volatile depending on what is happening.

3447 2018-03-21 17:18:18 Its not only what they have on him. A 19% stake in oil giant Rosneft was offered thru Carter Page in return for lifting sanctions. Trump wants that. Real $$, worth >11billion, which would bail him out of his Russian debt. Putin buys oligarchs, offered same to him. Dossier,p.30

3450 2018-03-21 17:17:52 Aww. My manicures recently started peeling a lot too (even with ORLY Bonder/Seche Vive when they didn’t before). I started wiping my nails down with isopropyl alcohol before painting to control oil and it seems to have stopped it.
3451 2018-03-21 17:17:33 We remain cautious on oil stocks and expect to see much lower prices for these stocks in the coming months.
3452 2018-03-21 17:17:20 what a bunch of  how dare they lie, on those badges, i'm sure oil rigs is really showing they care about sacred lands.  i don't know how much more we can take of the gop's destruction of our lands, air, water, crops, etc.  
3453 2018-03-21 17:17:19 1-0 til OIL etter kun 3 minutter spill. Herman Roseth får ballen på ca 20 meters hold, tar med seg ballen inn i banen og banker den i krysset. Fantastisk prestasjon av unggutten 
3454 2018-03-21 17:17:19 Anyone remember when I did a oil change in the 240 last

3457 2018-03-21 17:16:51 Why olive oil, not fish oil?
3458 2018-03-21 17:16:37 So you do realize that almond milk has many issues ethically as well, including reclaimed water from the oil industry. The water footprint of an almond is more along the lines of 460 gallons of water per pound of almonds. Knowledge is power.
3459 2018-03-21 17:16:27 That's all #Harambe ever wanted.
3460 2018-03-21 17:16:18 Let's not be the doctor who feels like it's appropriate to crash #disabled people's # events, and give us a bit if the old, we know everything, we are gods,we know your bodies and stories better than you bs. <3  Some castor oil might help with that.learning to listen when we talk
3461 2018-03-21 17:16:17 Don’t plan a trip to Rhode Island. We don’t want your oil rigs. We see how you operate. Btw, what hat do you wear on snow days?
3462 2018-03-21 17:16:16 Americans invading everything for oil meme is killing my sides rn
3463 2018-03-21 17:16:14 Lock me up. Quebec unjustly takes billions from Alberta. It doesn't own Canada's resources and you have to learn more about Stat Oil. Google it. Read the wall street journal. Norway is what Canada and Quebec should aspire to be but attitudes like yours prevent it.
3464 2018-03-21 17:16:13 Its not only what they have on him. A 19% stake in oil giant Rosneft was offered thru Carter Page in return for lifting sanctions. Trump wants that. Real $$, worth >11billion, which would bail him out of his Russian debt. Putin buys oligarchs, offered same to him.

3471 2018-03-21 17:15:19 Apparently CA Judge just released an illegal alien allegedly involved in human trafficking, caught by ICE, back onto the streets. 
3472 2018-03-21 17:15:17 I'd love to see @realDonaldTrump take a lie detector test about ANYTHING...EVERYTHING! Russia Collusion, Obstruction of Justice, Russian oil deals, money laundering, protitutes in Moscow, the ~20 women accusing him of sexual assault, his IQ, cheating..and yes, Stormy Daniels.

3477 2018-03-21 17:14:07 That coconut oil got no hold
3478 2018-03-21 17:14:07 Critically important point, Mark. A broad brush is a poor choice for detail and precision. To take the analogy further, a latex base shouldn't be used when an oil base is required and vice-versa.
3479 2018-03-21 17:14:02 i might do little oil paintings of the west end ham cast for july bc i'll be able to wait at stage door this time unlike in feb when i had to leave just as i saw cleve walking out and i cried
3480 2018-03-21 17:14:02 I go in just for a simple oil change and end up needing a new tire that’s 250 bucks. Why is this my life 
3481 2018-03-21 17:13:52 I just recieved and email that asked me if I wanted to register for a CBD oil Clinical Trial and I'm just over here like  issa trapp!!! lol!
3482 2018-03-21 17:13:38 It’s the 21st century version of an olive oil importer. A front for the mob.
3483 2018-03-21 17:13:28 A Natural gas pipe isn't such a big deal.  If it gets a leak it just goes straight up. Asia needs a LOT of gas. BC has been moving tons of oil up this coast for years.  And in boats that really do need upgrading. This is where the real danger is.
3484 2018-03-21 17:13:27 Ted Boutrous, atty. representing Chevron & oil industry in 1st ever #climatechange trial: “From Chevron’s perspective, there is no debate abt the science of climate change.” Company accepts it, questions if fed. court is best place to debate #SF & #Oak ‘policy choices’ on it
3485 2018-03-21 17:13:27 The oil sands emission cap was a grave mistake & ought to be lifted ASAP. Did we demand a cap on production of cars in #Ontario, ships in NS or aeroplanes in #Quebec? It’s the same thing, yet we somehow treat oil producers different than oil users  (car, ships, airplanes). 

Why?
3486 2018-03-21 17:13:25 愛してるゲームしよな

3488 2018-03-21 17:13:23 @egglesscooking, bought a brownie making kit which calls for 3 eggs, 100ml oil & 50ml water. Planning to replace 2 with vinegar, baking soda and 1 with squashed banana. Will it work?
3489 2018-03-21 17:12:54 If you truly believe that co2/climate change is the issue of the day then why don't peoes like you go after the increasing coal shipments from bc ports to Asia and elsewhere?  Far more to be gained from eliminating coal consumption than oil
3490 2018-03-21 17:12:49 The world is descending into tyranny: Trumps plans include taking over the United States and creating a three member (Russia, China, China) World Ruling Dictatorship. The three ruling member families will control oil, minerals, gems, monies, & life sustaining foods & grains. BAD!
3491 2018-03-21 17:12:49 The whole thing is kind of odd. Doherty was a special ops agent for the DOE. (Department of Energy) ...so was he brought up doing wet work for Uranium One deals? or Oil deals?
Shady, and who benefits most from the new narrative?

3502 2018-03-21 17:11:24 Keep warm, sleep lots, eat well, lots of steam so a bath or eucalyptus oil in a  diffuser and take anything that reduces sinus swelling (paracetamol and ibuprofen usually) I’m battling the same thing atm good luck xx
3503 2018-03-21 17:11:19 I usually just assume it means I need an oil change so yeah I ignore it
3504 2018-03-21 17:11:15 I didn’t do it because I soaked my hair in coconut oil last night so I will try it tomorrow
3505 2018-03-21 17:11:14 My cbd oil finished recently and I was surprisingly gifted with one, what an angel.

3511 2018-03-21 17:10:39 How are we going to pay for this? I am already paying a lot of taxes. Gas is at a 1.20 even though oil is half the cost it use to be due to carbon taxes. #eject please. #vote you out

3514 2018-03-21 17:10:35 I've mastered the art of cooking a curry with just 4 teaspoons of oil. 750gms chicken + 4 medium onions + masalas. Are you proud of me, @AgniBankai?
3515 2018-03-21 17:10:34 Best not to rely on oil patch spin to be anything more than spin.

3517 2018-03-21 17:10:24 The @g7 must agree to stop subsidizing oil, stop building pipelines, and escalate renewable energy infrastructure of all types.  #myG7 will make a #justtransition for workers and communities to renewable energy.  Leave it in the ground.

3524 2018-03-21 17:09:43 You think they're good now, toss 'em in sherry vinegar and olive oil and a little salt & pepper, and give em a day in the fridge.
3525 2018-03-21 17:09:42 I just took two veggie sausage patties and fried them in olive oil, broke them into little bits, and fried those, then added one egg and a bit of cheese and it is AWESOME breakfast protein and don't you @ me that I missed the whole point of the no-cholesterol veggie sausage.
3526 2018-03-21 17:09:28 Yaga began gnawing away the girl was near, she poured oil on their hinges; there in the whole matter.

3542 2018-03-21 17:08:24 I think you're kidding yourself if you think that nuclear or fossil fuels are cheap. This is a typical attack line these days, using nuclear to assault renewables. Meanwhile, renewables are cheaper than nuclear, coal, oil, and increasingly gas. Mass production = more price falls.

3544 2018-03-21 17:08:19 our research is based on Shell and Eni because to their credit they are the only JVs that publish oil spill reports.

3547 2018-03-21 17:08:08 i feel like every time i get my car’s oil changed at courtesy, they break something so we have to pay another $200 to fix it
3548 2018-03-21 17:08:01 Because there is a demand for oil.
3549 2018-03-21 17:07:52 Kevin - do they provide loadings by type, can you seperate crude oil form other commodities?  I'm guessing that would look rather dramatic.

3562 2018-03-21 17:06:18 They still pretend that ilaje & okitipkupka are oil producing twn but haven't seen light 4 more than 3 years now, I think they make alot of money selling petrol in dat town & pretendin about no light there, community runin there life on petrol alone. checkout @MBuhari we re sharp
3563 2018-03-21 17:06:15 Would you have arrested him, given the possibility of the Niger delta Avengers returning to the creeks to blow up oil pipelines?.... just when we are coming out of recession? You must think the people in government are stupid.
3564 2018-03-21 17:06:14 Yes. and all the Obama acolytes jumped all over him for it. Hence, people tweeting the story that their guy did it too. 
(He also let him take Crimea and set up bases in Syria to support Assad, tried to stifle domestic oil production... but hey Putin LOVES Trump, or something.)
3565 2018-03-21 17:06:09 ねむい
3566 2018-03-21 17:05:57 Unfortunately a number of those existed to protect our planet and animals. He believes gas and oil plus the joy of killing are more important.  Do you really agree with being able to kill sleeping bears and cubs while in their den ? Cowards.  Hopefully we won't see smog alerts.
3567 2018-03-21 17:05:52 This is true. And America has a history of LOVING snake oil salesmen.
3568 2018-03-21 17:05:50 Genius it's in Black and White an English proffessor who worked for a Russain Univ and Russian oil company is who have access to FB accounts to Cambridge Analytica
3569 2018-03-21 17:05:50 More reasons to support green & local biz. Don't think It's too little to make a difference.  During oil embargo in 70's, Americans cut back energy consumption to extent of econ damage to OPEC members.
3570 2018-03-21 17:05:41 Breaking:  The Edmonton Oil Kings have landed the 1st overall pick in the 2018 WHL Bantam Draft on Thursday, May 3rd!  The Kootenay Ice ball was drawn, so they move from 4 to 2nd overall.  #bantamdraft18
3571 2018-03-21 17:05:39 Tip. absolutely no oil! Measure the corn kernels with the cup and pour them into the bowl, put on the lid and put it all into the micro. For as long as a microwave (3-4 min, depending on the microwave), you get perfectly crisp and good popcorn.
3572 2018-03-21 17:05:27 Who sold uranium ? Our oil company ? Who limiting oil production? Who gave Russia skolkovo ? Who gave Chinese military technology ? Who giving the Chinese taxpayer funded technology for cars ? Clintons, Obama ,Kerry ,Biden ,Jerry brown .

3575 2018-03-21 17:05:14 Norway actually invested stat oil. I would love to take no risk and do no work and get other people's money too... wait that's stealing. I'd rather society reward the producers than the takers. source on Quebec owning all mineral and gas in Canada? Quebec takes billions from AB.
3576 2018-03-21 17:05:13 I lost a 50 dollar bill this morning and was like fuck it idec anymore at least it wasn't a $100 bill, then an hour later i made exactly $50 inbetween unexpected oil changes, tire plugs and tips. Moral of the story, just chill and trust the universe 🖒🖒

*grabs Applebee’s gift card and hands my car over*
3581 2018-03-21 17:04:56 He took the money.... and then had him killed.
Had his buddy Bernard-Henri Levy down there stirring up the locals so Gaddafi would stomp them.
Gaddafi used anti aircraft guns on them

3725 2018-03-21 16:50:57 But I am not crazy about the smell. I need almond oil to come with that same energy

3727 2018-03-21 16:50:42 The secret to whiter teeth is brushing with orange essential oil ! Put one drop of the oil and brush ! You will see a difference!  #EssentialOils #orange #YoungLiving
3728 2018-03-21 16:50:39 Is that before or after equalization payments? There are some countries that actually use hydrocarbons to advance green energy. Like Norway. You should research them. Stat oil, and how they lead green tech and beat kyoto. They want to sell their surplus green energy to neighbors

3730 2018-03-21 16:50:35 The future of the #WHL is up for grabs in mere moments. The annual draft lottery is set to take place from WHL headquarters. The Hitmen have the third-best odds to land the #1 overall pick. Only the PG Cougars and EDM Oil Kings finished with a worse record.
3731 2018-03-21 16:50:33 By contributing to the war on drugs and imprisoning drug users? Thus, sending them into a cycle of poverty and addiction? By not legalizing weed/CBD oil of which can help? You are doing nothing. #VoteChuckOut #Mitchell4Congress

3743 2018-03-21 16:49:07 It is not oil so you guys don't give a crap. Everything is bad in your eyes yet you all shake the hands of those who do wrong. Saudi women can only start driving now and people selling horns is ok with you because of trade. Spare me please

3746 2018-03-21 16:49:01 today I have started my 4 week “detox”, cleaned and sorted my room out, drunk so much water, took all the pills I’m meant to, done the washing, applied castor oil as treatment for my hair and will now shower and make a healthy dinner, coming through motherfuckers watch this space

3749 2018-03-21 16:48:31 Specifically it failed because Chavez used all the profits for social projects, didn’t invest in upkeep, and fired the management that knew what they were doing, installing his cronies instead. When the price of oil fell (which it does, it’s called market forces) no more money.
3750 2018-03-21 16:48:11 i didnt know youre not supposed to put the stove on high when youre using butter instead of oil so i accidentaly burned butter onto a pan and when i went to wash it off immediately the faucet water burst into steam in my face and this is why i still dont know how to cook
3751 2018-03-21 16:48:05 Anything that is less scented & is organic is good for your skin.. like the raw cocoanut oil is good.

3755 2018-03-21 16:47:55 We have been so lead astray. Don't bother with the Old Testament they say. But what do they not want you to read? The Holy oil is a gift from God to keep us healthy and connect us to the divine by opening our 3rd eye. Virgin olive oil, cannabis, oils of myrrh and cinnamon. Amen.

3759 2018-03-21 16:47:20 Cheapest opportunity in markets today,  IMO.  No one -- seriously -- believes 100 oil is possible again.  Imagine if that changes.
3760 2018-03-21 16:47:18 Allen went over more than a century of science. But part of the cities’ lawsuit alleges oil companies mounted campaign to raise doubts about climate science in the late 20th century. So examples like Nordhaus could have legal significance @scienceinsider

3774 2018-03-21 16:46:07 I don't think raising taxes on electricity, natural gases and oil is helpful, I need electricity at home and work , i need natural gas to heat my home and I need fuel to get to work and back . Taxing things I need to use to cheaper something i may not need to use isnt helpful
3775 2018-03-21 16:45:56 wouldnt cooing in a roasting pan on a rack b same? (maybe less clean up) Doing a leg of lamb, bone in, for my family for easter and always boning up on tips and tricks.

3776 2018-03-21 16:45:53 Today’s #ft says now is time to buy shares in oil and #Facebook. Whereas I want to profit from investing in nice people doing nice things: perhaps that’s just a loser.
3777 2018-03-21 16:45:51 It's huge but it's simply one thread that leads back to the oil money manipulating our democracy and destroying our only planet.

3790 2018-03-21 16:44:21 At times I cogitate that how much we have underrated Najam Sethi for his services... He burnt his mid night oil and worked relentlessly but we especially this uncouth and boorish youth aka youthias has always slandered him viciously... BAD and highly UNFORTUNATE!
3791 2018-03-21 16:44:17 .@TimCoronel @TomCoronel You're very successful. However, just as I ask religious follows do Twitter search "@HydeFineArt religion" I suggest you do one on "@HydeFineArt oil." If you still follow me after that, you are true leaders & perhaps you're even greening your industry...?
3792 2018-03-21 16:44:17 Ummm... #Commodities is what took Saskatchewan to new heights. Brad just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Oil $130/barrel, gold 2000/oz, potash $1200/ton, uranium $60/lb, wheat $8/bushel...go look at those values now. He rode in & out on a commodity wave

3801 2018-03-21 16:43:29 But you cannot make progress as a nation without innovation and innovation is what they did, as brutal as it was. For example, were Africans aware of the potential for trade across oceans for oil palm & rubber? Even education in some African city-states wasn’t not exploited

3811 2018-03-21 16:42:59 First of all Trumps fracking policies are a direct threat to russia's main source of power, their oil wealth and their control over eastern and central europe via pipelines, this was neutered when trump when to the three seas conference in poland and offered to sell them gas
3812 2018-03-21 16:42:52 Tar shampoo wat wat? My eczema is just awful its on my scalp and my shin and sometimes flares up on my arms...I've been using tea tree oil and vitamin E and ita pretty good
3813 2018-03-21 16:42:47 Yes it is as I describe in my previous post. Your quote deals only with Line 2 which is the heavy oil line while ignoring the space opened up on Line 1, which is the point @sjmuir is trying to make.
3814 2018-03-21 16:42:36 So it's mostly false on the basis that Scottish Oil isnt "Scottish" .... Does that not prove the methodology used by UK is completely false? Ergo trade surplus.

3821 2018-03-21 16:42:02 After redoing the back left frame, painting it, new lights, and got the soft top, new tires and rims the engine was knocking way to much. I was going to put thicker oil and see if it would help but at that point forget it. Ended up selling it to a lucky motha fucka

3823 2018-03-21 16:41:50 @JustinTrudeau Why Do we not reactivate the refineries in the Vancouver Area? We could be upgrading the bitumen and refining to fuels instead of shipping raw product.

3865 2018-03-21 16:37:15 I wanted to try castor oil but I didn’t know if it would be too strong.

3867 2018-03-21 16:37:01 Maybe they just have a very powerful engine. Nothing to do with oil burning 
3868 2018-03-21 16:36:49 Allen finishes with ‘77 paper by economist William Nordhaus predicting temp increase. Similar to observations since. “It was possible for scientists in 1977 to make a remarkably accurate prediction.” Cities say science clear as oil companies argued it wasn’t. @ScienceInsider

3870 2018-03-21 16:36:42 Those oil barrels are blocking your path!
3871 2018-03-21 16:36:36 Is/was Premier Moe proposing to "turn off the oil taps" to the U.S. in retaliation to potential tariffs on aluminum and steel? Or does he only "get tough" when he's opposing governments that aren't on the extreme right?
3872 2018-03-21 16:36:20 Think what drilling and fracking does and oil spills in the ocean.  At least the land is still fertile to grow.
3873 2018-03-21 16:35:48 me: talks shit about subway, boasting that jrecks is better 
also me: settles for subway when craving jrecks because I can’t justify a 7 hour drive for a sandwich 
additionally me: confuses the subway employee when I ask for “oil and shakers” on my sub

3874 2018-03-21 16:35:43 So i almost have zero oil in my house, and the other day it showed it'd be fine for at least 2 to 3 days, I fucking hate this house. Landlord's a piece of shit who never fixes anything.

By the way Trump only 30% of America is buying your PROPAGANDA go tell Putin your problems
3877 2018-03-21 16:35:11 You mean the “systems” that coerce the world to convert to and hold dollars to buy any oil, in order to prop up our economy unfairly? That “system”? It only brings ill will. Kiss it goodbye.

3879 2018-03-21 16:35:03 It was one month. So, I have got a little bit more time. Oil stocks continue to underperform, despite high oil price. After three weks we can speak once again.

3889 2018-03-21 16:34:27 Eliminating the need to burn fossil fuels IS preparing for the coming change. So much of our oil comes from the oceans and if they rise an inch that has a significant effect between the actual sea rise and the increase in numbers and intensity of ocean storms. Wind and solar FTW.
3890 2018-03-21 16:34:22 so ends mini- tweetstorm - backdrop for oil is still very much +ve , price has rallied strongly accordingly, however the large long built up amongst specs does "feel" like a little headwind in immediate future so will be looking to sell rallies now to reduce positions imho
3891 2018-03-21 16:34:13 @TheRangeUK 12th March I order oil paint, only half turn up, I then have to ring 4 times to chase my order up to be told its not in stock and will be refunded the difference, that was over a week ago, I ring up now to chase yet again, refund in 7 working days from today ?????????
3892 2018-03-21 16:34:07 With all that oil in my face I'm practically waiting for the US army to set up shop
3893 2018-03-21 16:33:59 Russia is an economic weakling, solely dependent on the price of crude oil.  Puting will only talk about economic reforms but never implement them because it would threaten his control.  Instead, he works to weaken other countries in any way he can.

3908 2018-03-21 16:32:23 The "Deep State" is financed/controlled/established by Islamic oil cash. Any Muslim performs jihad- wether they are allowed to remember or not. Those are the facts I've witnessed directly from clandestine positions within corporate Islam these past 50 years.

3941 2018-03-21 16:29:37 Look with alQaaeda done, ISIS finished, and the public wise to BLiar style invasions of oil territories, governments have to generate “enemies” to justify rigid controls. If the public went feral and the gov had no army Uk would vanish in a cloud of cheap lager!

3972 2018-03-21 16:26:49 And by the same token, hosting disingenuous snake oil salesmen like Peterson is an offensive waste of time and resources. Protesting against him isn't 'censoring' him - it's arguing the time and space should be given to someone with something useful to say.
3973 2018-03-21 16:26:40 Because you like being dependant on foreign oil where the governments  have very poor human rights records?

3976 2018-03-21 16:26:30 AFAIK, the folks at KM don't own the oil. They get paid to transport it. Period. If Alberta producers want to take the risk, KM will charge them to ship it. And all business investments involve risk. Sometimes they pay off. Sometimes they don't. Let's be honest about it.

3987 2018-03-21 16:25:23 Completely disagree! Its all about energy prices and energy prices are rising a lot. oil prices have risen 30% in the past year and over 100% since their 2016 lows! If oil prices continue to rise at this pace, this may cause the yield curve to go inverted.

3998 2018-03-21 16:24:30 Yep. And in the case of ISIS, it’s often in oil dependent countries with little other resources, so their survival is going to get more desperate.
3999 2018-03-21 16:24:25 We are transitioning but the pace is far too costly. 1B vehicles worldwide run on oil, and 2B in 30 years. The entire food chain runs on oil for 8B people. Advocating end of oil is advocating mass starvation! Oil is life. It’s not sunsetting. Peak demand likely 2040-2050 only !!
4000 2018-03-21 16:24:22 I have to admit I laughed out loud after reading the @CBCNews article about zircon and titanium being found in the waste from oil sands after a discussion I had with people from British Columbia yesterday about how bad the oil sands are. They were at a golf course.

4008 2018-03-21 16:24:05 It’s not relevant to compare power cell technology from 1900 to 2018. Oil was more practical back then yes, but is it going to be practical once the oil reserves are depleted?
4009 2018-03-21 16:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

4022 2018-03-21 16:22:27 No, from Bush’s Norton to Jewell, it has been a huge decline. As Obama became the oil and gas president, we started drilling more than ever before. Obama kept many Bush policies as well with the exception of attempting to address climate change in management plans but really did

4032 2018-03-21 16:20:49 The oul in that pipeline is not for domestic use.  I think its pretty damn clear that the recent survey of gas prices across the entire country shows that the province of BC, and Vancouver in particular are being extorted and gouged by Big Oil because of resistance

4036 2018-03-21 16:20:17 Italy has many rich cuisines, but also has many key ingredients that are beneficial for your diet, including olive oil (high in heart healthy monosaturated fatty acids), tomatoes (high in vitamin C and antioxidants), and garlic (reduces blood pressure and cholesterol).
4037 2018-03-21 16:20:14 Coconut oil was marketed to be good to cook with, on your skin and in your hair. The biggest lies ever

4097 2018-03-21 16:15:08 This article appears to assume that the KM pipeline will guarantee world prices for WCS. But there's no guarantee that the oil piped to Burnaby won't just be shipped at a discount to US customers. It's a gamble. Let's be honest about the business risk.
4098 2018-03-21 16:15:08 Coconut oil isn't actually better for you than shortening. Any plant fat solid at room temperature is highly hydrogenated. 

That said, it' melts more quickly than shortening and that will affect texture. It'll also impart a coconut taste.

4102 2018-03-21 16:14:43 it seems like the oil industry is more permissive to electric car concepts now (versus solar or any other concept), bc at this point they realize they can’t fight it all off completely, and they’re thinking “well at least the electric grid still mostly runs off fossil fuels”

4333 2018-03-21 15:52:55 Natural Beauty Tip for Split Ends:- 

Mash an avocado and massage it in your damp hair, coating the split ends.

Rinse it out after thirty minutes.

If required, some olive oil can also be used into it.

4336 2018-03-21 15:52:40 U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration (IEO - 63.93) is responding positively to the current rise in crude. It is breaking up from near-term consolidation and appears headed toward its recent high of 70.54.
4337 2018-03-21 15:52:40 Bring some oil back lmao
4338 2018-03-21 15:52:36 America is always trying to find oil, as in Crude oil for Gas and fuel and stuff.

If you still don’t get it then idk how to explain the joke.
4339 2018-03-21 15:52:36 the more I learn about crude the more I'm realizing these inventory numbers leave a few important items out like grade of oil, export levels sitting in inventory, relative productions curve - wont call it a circus act but it is lacking when considering views of importance

4348 2018-03-21 15:51:55 One funny side of the day, was when our convoy stopped and we put a ammo truck next to oil well that was on fire. You were never allowed to cuss on the radio, well the CO did when Ant Main informed him of the fact that the ammo truck was next to oil well on fire.

4406 2018-03-21 15:46:25 the patterns work even better in crude oil futures....more volatility
4407 2018-03-21 15:46:23 Good luck with EIA-i have given up on investing in energy stuff-Methinks it is all pushed around by algos and weather-got one long term play in LNG and that's it-might buy play or two after the midsummer trough- or Shell and XON when oil prices eventually slump but not before

4413 2018-03-21 15:45:57 It is, each side calls the other divisive and then throws more oil on the fire. People have become free advertising. Irony is if you have enough money you can just invest in both sides and get what you want no matter what
4414 2018-03-21 15:45:53 Really I pump gas and it is continuing to rise at the pumps!! It has been forecasted to be near 3 dollars a gallon in the near future!! By summer My guess closer to 4!!! This Happened under Bush administration they were in Bed with Oil Companies Then and Now!!!
4415 2018-03-21 15:45:50 Unlike my opponent, I believe in our precious oil supply, our right to borrow money from Asia and our heroes of 9/11.

4420 2018-03-21 15:45:22 Oilers out. Season is over. If I have to pick another team to win it - Jets. But only because Oil aren't in. It's Moore about who I don't want to win anything - TO, Ana, LA, etc
4421 2018-03-21 15:45:20 Fresh off might as well go get my oil changed while I got time 
4422 2018-03-21 15:45:19 The guy who is supposed to be changing the oil in my car is literally staring back at me while he eats a sandwich. Why
4423 2018-03-21 15:45:17 จริงค่ะคราวนี้มาเข้มมสุดดด หล่อมาก
4424 2018-03-21 15:45:05 Hope you got an extra oil change from Tharg

Market up jobs up companies coming back ms13 down. VA getting better the military getting funded. Tax cuts oil sales up and much more
4430 2018-03-21 15:44:33 Russia's Energy Minister Novak says he hasn’t yet seen proposals for new ways of measuring oil inventories from JTC of OPEC/non-OPEC.
“Currently, we are committed to achieving the targeted result-which was agreed on at ministerial meetings- reaching the 5-year average"

4432 2018-03-21 15:44:09 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4433 2018-03-21 15:44:03 Q....why have UKs Oil Revenues been falling?......that’s if you believe all the figures!  ....by design or accident?....former I think.
4434 2018-03-21 15:43:54 The other issue I've heard is if we shift power consumption away from oil/gasoline to electric, would necessitate us expanding nuclear power. Not sure if that's true.

4454 2018-03-21 15:42:35 #EconomyToday base metals , agg, oil making moves  on the back of lower dollar. $BCX is a good all around resource play to hold up in. At low end of range . Good hedge to your hedges.
4455 2018-03-21 15:42:28 I loved Obama, but how he handled the BP oil spill, his inaction against the Dakota Pipeline and Flint Water Crisis were disturbing. I did not love George W, but he still brought our country together after 9/11. Waging war with the wrong country afterwards is unforgivable though.
4456 2018-03-21 15:42:28 look at oil  $$$$$$$   more  $$$$$$$$$$$  for #trin @Trinity_PLC
4457 2018-03-21 15:42:24 A friend tried to comfort me last night and I could only give them the cling film version of my problems because words don’t exist this week and feelings exist under blankets. Take a shower, wash out the fire burning in your gut, finish it off with beard oil and an orgasm.
4458 2018-03-21 15:42:20 Wow, looked it up, his name was lucky larry, and hedidn't get eaten by sharks, he got smashed off a makeshift bridge by an oil tank that caught fire when it hit the water.

4462 2018-03-21 15:42:10 That’s inaccurate statement and factual not true. SKY NEWS BBC & C4 LBC all have carried  this story. 
4463 2018-03-21 15:41:56 Oils do not moisturize. They seal. So don’t only oil your hair or skin but moisturize it too. It’s all in how you layer your products #UAPB_RYS18 #UNCFSU_RYS18 #Lane_RYS18

4465 2018-03-21 15:41:47 I love my auto repair guy, never taxes, and gives me free oil changes 
4466 2018-03-21 15:41:46 @BayKingMotor terrible service, take the car in for oil change and rear window defrost at 9:30. Diagnostics on rear window is ok. They tell me the top portion is my radio antenna and are doing the oil change as I type. 21/2 hrs.
4467 2018-03-21 15:41:24 Results from today's #offshore #oil and #gas lease sale: 159 bids from 33 companies, about $124.8 million in high bids (up from $121 million last sale.)
4468 2018-03-21 15:41:14 Well that’s what I’m looking up. By nature and rule, the USPS doesn’t have a budget for federal funding. Subsidies fall under a different rule that will be tax dollars. Just like oil companies receive subsidies, but for other reasons. So hang tight sunshine.
4469 2018-03-21 15:41:13 What??? McDonald’s??? They haven’t been the same since they changed their oil.

4471 2018-03-21 15:40:49 That alliance is centered around the petrodollar.
USA currency is used around the world for oil trading in a deal Nixon admin worked w/OPEC.
So getting around that mess will require a miracle.
That doesn't stop me for praying for one.

4481 2018-03-21 15:40:01 Natural Beauty Tip for Split Ends:- 

Massage your hair with castor oil, mixed with mustard and olive oil, to get split ends free hair. 

Keep it for 30 minutes, and wrap with a towel or shower cap.

Afterwards, rinse it off with shampoo.

4488 2018-03-21 15:39:23 Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the oval office (not that I care) but then lied about it. CNN glorified him as if he was a god. If he was a Democrat do you really think they would care? CNN and all other mainstream media are hypocrites.
4489 2018-03-21 15:39:20 The burden of proof rests with the prosecution. I want to see Arnold prove that the oil companies have changed the climate, and then proved they knew about it as long as he claims they have.
4490 2018-03-21 15:39:16 Why oil is extending higher?
4491 2018-03-21 15:39:13 Oil lobbyists have @JustinTrudeau in there back pocket. Same old liberal party nothing has changed. Controlled by their lobbyists pals. Corporations.

If they aren't, that will make my life better.

4499 2018-03-21 15:38:40 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
4500 2018-03-21 15:38:33 Coconut oil makes me break out. Find a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, its a humectant, which means it attracts moisture. Neutrogena makes an OK one,  Mario badescu makes a brilliant one.
4501 2018-03-21 15:38:18 I used to swear by garlic. Raw, pressed garlic, like half a head, drizzled with a little olive oil and eaten with bread so you don't die. That always kicked shit out of my system. It doesn't do it as well with the chemo+humira thing. :(

4519 2018-03-21 15:35:46 Absolutely. The data is oil, isnt even validated to the level of data is crude, I will decie on that after digital lending startups based on IndiaStack take their money back :) A lot of stuff on data is marketing / hype, but that doesnt mean it can be free for all :)

Example, until Al Gore gets rid of his mansions and stops flying around the world, how could you take him seriously on CO2.  Like a Dr. smoking, while he tells me to stop smoking - but Dr. buys offsets?

4526 2018-03-21 15:34:28 In the 1990s, it seemed like every bad guy in a children's movie or TV show was a developer or oil baron.

4735 2018-03-21 15:11:31 At the dealership getting my oil changed. Made the appointment under my name. Dude keeps calling out my husband’s name even though he was JUST THE CO SIGNER. Totally ignoring him. Poor sap just can’t seem to find me! #boohoo
4736 2018-03-21 15:11:12 Since when do oil changes cost so much?! Good Lord
4737 2018-03-21 15:11:11 Some of you arm chair critics just make it look like it's that simple. A small Tompolo that PMB attempted to arrest in 2016, plunged Nigeria into a recession. Abi you weren't in the country when they were busy bursting the oil pipelines daily. Too much talk

4744 2018-03-21 15:10:33 I always pop the bonnet and check there's a new clean oil filter, and check that they've done the mundane things like greased the door hinges and bonnet catch. Today I will also check the washer jets as they were wonky and I couldn't get them straight in time this morning…

Thanks for the new follows! What brings you to @INETInnovation ?
4768 2018-03-21 15:07:19 Why do people always have to hate on stuff that doesn't work for them?

Coconut oil doesn't work for your skin? Fine. Doesn't make it trash.

Take whatever works for YOU and go.
4769 2018-03-21 15:07:10 So: take national land, and sell it to mine for oil? You have never dug in the dirt nor planted a seed in your life. Family farms are destroyed by trumpism
4770 2018-03-21 15:07:08 Or...how to change the oil in your car and have a dog.
4771 2018-03-21 15:07:08 Aloe Vera or vitamin e oil
4772 2018-03-21 15:07:06 I won't have any products with Palm oil in my house due to the deforestation of the Sumatran & Borneo rainforests killing the Orangutans and literally thousands of species its in more and more products and increasing for over 5 years now
4773 2018-03-21 15:06:54 By end of month. I didn’t need oil until November, I was thrilled. At about $2k now in oil. Not happy. Just want to be outside again.
4774 2018-03-21 15:06:54 I always cringe at stories like this... only an oil change and they suddenly find "Everything thats wrong" .... Hope it isnt a scammy place you went to. Saw an CBC marketplace about this once..
4775 2018-03-21 15:06:51 Omg I’m ROLLING  that oil meme is actually too funny
4776 2018-03-21 15:06:48 yes topical! it’s an oil...

4778 2018-03-21 15:06:21 They'll find any excuse to keep people from voting. Like have you seen our congress? I trust any adult in this country to understand politics better than the people paid by oil or Wallstreet to destroy our planet. This is a basic human right that's denied up to 1.5MM people
4779 2018-03-21 15:06:19 Depends on how much you take, everything looks like a moving oil painting. Everything is in super HD. You feel unchained tbh. I love watching my plants breathe. The trees dance. The constellations on a nice night ...just wow.
4780 2018-03-21 15:06:09 Before the seasonal slowdown in US crude oil stocks kick offs in earnest following the end of the maintenance season.
4781 2018-03-21 15:06:08 Yeah because dirty air and water, opening public lands to be raped by oil companies, ensuring Dreamers live in fear for their very existence, is all so good for the country. Sending his son-in-law all over the world to hunt for private financing. All so good for the country.
4782 2018-03-21 15:06:05 I thought the "diversified economy" was going to balance the books. imagine that, it's still oil leading the way
4783 2018-03-21 15:05:54 BIO OIL!! It takes a few months but it’s worth it!
4784 2018-03-21 15:05:44 Never use peroxide. Never. Any piercer will tell you to NEVER use it. 
Pure Tea tree oil doesn't always work. I used a salve from @earthmama and it worked on my bump. What kind of symptoms of an infection are you having? It's more than likely just irritated. Infections are rarer.
4785 2018-03-21 15:05:35 The Cambridge Analytica - Trump campaign affair and the connections of Russian oil giant Lukoil to the Kremlin and Cambridge Analytica pose even more important questions about what the Trump campaign did and how they profited from the Russian digital meddling operation

4965 2018-03-21 14:48:41 ha memang tak habis habis dengan cleansing oil yang mana satu nak beli
4966 2018-03-21 14:48:40 We were accosted by a seemingly mad woman in Morrisons , who pointed out that their cheap vegetable oil was intact 100% rapeseed  oil . Awesome find . A lovely shopping session with Kate Pankhurst
4967 2018-03-21 14:48:38 I come to get an oil change. Get upset that it costed so much. Go to pay the ridiculous charge and realize that I left my wallet at my house. Incase you're wondering, yes I do hate my life.
4968 2018-03-21 14:48:34 I still think $FANG is the leader in the oil patch if that group ever gets going on a sustained basis. Solid relative strength.
4969 2018-03-21 14:48:22 We are based out of Lancaster Ohio and we are trying to get funding to race the Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model National Touring Division.
4970 2018-03-21 14:48:17 I bought a ton of stock in a company, I think it was USOG (United State Oil and Gas). Bought it for something like $0.0003/each. Yeah, 33 Stocks per penny. Had hundreds of thousands of them. (Maybe $2-3k bucks). Then waited for the coming bump...

4972 2018-03-21 14:47:35 The arguments run that *London needs Scotland's wind. (an indeed water)*  But these are just as simplistic and therefore wrong as the old *oil price as panacea* 

wind can be built easily around the shallower waters of southern Britain, ....
4973 2018-03-21 14:47:30 Like I've been saying to all those doubting this deal, it's NET dollars (rubles) received not NET brls produced that is imprtant. Oil EGO in the form of "my wells are better than your wells!" Is so 2014. These producers may be volatile and unpredictable but they can count NET $!!

4976 2018-03-21 14:47:18 what do you mean? I love drinking oil in juice form
4977 2018-03-21 14:47:17 Friend to Ate Guard: Saan po makakabili ng ULING?

Ate Guard: Try niyo po sa mga karinderia

Me:(thinking bakit kailangan ng uling) Bakit kailangan ng uling?

Friend: Huh?! Experiment natin yun today right?

Me: OIL kailangan

Friend: ULING = OIL

Couldn’t stop laughing today!

4980 2018-03-21 14:46:55 where was Putin pre Obama? how powerful was Putin during the Bush era? and Russia's economy based on natural resources mainly oil which has been weak Putin became Putin during the Obama presidency why would Putin want someone different or an unknown

4982 2018-03-21 14:46:39 The saudis had already mentioned in Feb that they will manipulate the imports in March..so the market already knows. speculative money will make this run because the EIA looks good:)
4983 2018-03-21 14:46:38 I can't even knock the motor oil thing.
One of my friends in college used butter to tan. Not even kidding, she would pull out a tub of butter at the apartment pool and start slathering away like she was a roasting turkey.
I kinda wonder what her skin looks like now.
4984 2018-03-21 14:46:38 Why tf do I pay so much for oil utilities if it's been 55 degrees in here since last night hmm? HMMMMM??
4985 2018-03-21 14:46:38 You were “legally trained and certified to others” - great, if you’re so passionate about it go start your own shop and teach ppl. Guns, especially carried by students, don’t belong on campus. 1) creates greater power dynamics 2) makes it easier to fall into the wrong hands

4988 2018-03-21 14:46:33 Point taken.   But, Chavez did start them down a dark path, and oil prices dropping is the main reason their economy is down.   I agree this is unnecessary,  but I'd hardly hold this against Bernie all that much.   It's not calling for direct intervention, from what I can tell.

4990 2018-03-21 14:46:30 Bonds are also necessary for countries selling their oil for USD; this double dipping of dollar exposure lets us share the pain of inflation AND create a market for new bonds. How will oil producers be affected by a bond bubble collapse?
4991 2018-03-21 14:46:25 うんwww
4992 2018-03-21 14:46:25 Subsidize education and health not these oil distributors

4998 2018-03-21 14:45:42 So I'm getting my oil changed and there's an african man sitting next to me, and he turns to me and shows me a video of a cat chasing a mouse and asks me if the "movie" Tom & Jerry are like that because he's never seen it 
4999 2018-03-21 14:45:21 Protestants are like a series of opportunist snake oil salesmen coming up with a sleeker con in perpetual succession, like a Russian doll of Joel Osteens.
5000 2018-03-21 14:45:20 Things I have texted while watching Gypsy Sisters:
"WTH do they all wear jeans to get married, or just vests?"
"Why are they tanning this 5 year old?"
"Dude, she just used motor oil to tan."
"I'm done! They are eating their steaks well done and with A-1 sauce!"
5001 2018-03-21 14:45:15  IKR... I mean, yeah coconut oil all day. Just never tried the butter. Never had anything call for it I guess
5002 2018-03-21 14:45:14 Tadi beli aromatheraphy oil dgn harapan lepas ni boleh tidur dengan nyenyak dan aman dan jugak tenang.
5003 2018-03-21 14:45:07 Water activates gluten in the flour. Similar to breadmaking. Oil disperses in the flour in clumps that has almost no water, and separates flour granules from binding.
5004 2018-03-21 14:45:05 Oil change 
5005 2018-03-21 14:45:03 mannn make you own. Buy a loose highlighter, an oil that your skin really likes, shake it all up, and apply w a fan brush and set w a translucent setting powder.

5007 2018-03-21 14:44:50 Met a scientist we’ll be hearing from today in California climate science court hearing: Gary Griggs, UC Santa Cruz geologist who led an expert team that recently issued a state-commissioned report about sea level rise. Brought in by cities suing oil companies @ScienceInsider
5008 2018-03-21 14:44:48 That is grey squirrel damage if ever I saw it. Mix a few chilli pepper seeds in with peanuts and give it all a light dusting with chilli oil or chilli powder. Birds can't taste it, but the grey tree rats will. They won't be back much after that.
5009 2018-03-21 14:44:42 Man City have more relegations than league titles. Small oil club.
5010 2018-03-21 14:44:15 When I do my slick backs I use the green, olive oil gel.
5011 2018-03-21 14:44:13 I am gonna get some oil of some description. Came down to Sainsburys there to see if they have something. Such a rotten pain lol
5012 2018-03-21 14:44:07 The nature & interests of the Alliance partners have changed. 
US/Saudi Special relationship transitions from Energy Security to Arms sales. 
US does not depend on oil, while Saudi is depending on arms to protect itself from threats emanating from its policies.
5013 2018-03-21 14:43:58 I use tea tree oil in my hair. Works wonders even if you don't have hair.
5014 2018-03-21 14:43:39 Only if he’s on the right. White on the right. There should be a meme or hashtag for that.

5016 2018-03-21 14:43:29 Personally I think our governments should be sending off people specifically to train and work abroad then we manage our own oil drilling

5028 2018-03-21 14:42:47 Hi day is it a good day to long Drip today? Seems to be good timing in line with your oil price projection
5029 2018-03-21 14:42:34 Sir, we have our local #CambridgeAnalytica types hyper active in India, so much so that I get 5 calls a week based on my stolen data to pitch products to me. DND is also ignored. Data is indeed new oil but in wrong hands.
5030 2018-03-21 14:42:32 "Elon, this is ridiculous. Creating an internet company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to "make money". If it was about money, I'd just do another oil company" - someone 30 years ago or something
5031 2018-03-21 14:42:15 “Chevron will not be engaging in a debate on climate change science,” said Avi Garbow, a lawyer for the oil company and former general counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Instead, Chevron will offer Alsup “a neutral assessment of the science,” he said.

5032 2018-03-21 14:42:15 It might just be me, but I thoroughly enjoy getting my oil changes at the Bridgeport @Valvoline .  Great customer service and personality

5034 2018-03-21 14:42:08 My thoughts on oil is still 70$ per barrel.
5035 2018-03-21 14:42:00 With the warm weather in the South, real crude is used for gasoline as butane is pulled out of gasoline. Other oil category started to go up.
5036 2018-03-21 14:41:57 There you are still hawking snake oil aka the #GOPTaxScam ! #BlueWaveComing2018
5037 2018-03-21 14:41:50 EIA US weekly oil inventories -2622K vs +3250K expected

CRUDE on FIRE FIRE FIRE.................!!!!
5038 2018-03-21 14:41:46 Had that argument helped win indyref the subsequent collapse in oil price wouldn't have mattered to the SNP in terms of political calculation...but it would have meant a terrible reckoning economically , and a catastrophic weakness in negotiating position  as cash ran out.
5039 2018-03-21 14:41:45 Scots economy is viable even without oil and gas Ted,,have you not yet grasped that much of your info is union info,,you really should get news and info from other sources,but sadly you wont,,cos nats are the brainwashed not unionists eh Ted
5040 2018-03-21 14:41:43 I think he got his theology degree from the PT Barnum Divinity School and majored in Snake Oil Sales.
I bet his favourite movie is Never Give a Sucker an Even Break.
5041 2018-03-21 14:41:43 CHANGE OF SUBJECT; Did anyone see the KSA map of States Trump is allowing exploration drilling. Yep on National News sitting next to Trump was the map. He is giving away our Country’s oil resources to Saudi Arabia oil company. Washington, California, Texas
5042 2018-03-21 14:41:40 #EIA #oil #data: U.S. #crude oil #imports averaged about 7.1 million bpd last week, -508,000 bpd vs previous week; over last 4 weeks imports averaged 7.5 million bpd, -4.8% vs year ago. #OOTT #energy #tankers #shipping #energy #oilandgas

5044 2018-03-21 14:41:33 Constituent sectors of FTSE- banks terrible performers - oil stocks disappointing - drugs & retail sectors underperformed as have utilities - also remember FTSE 100 is not a barometer of UK’s economy! Very eclectic & international

5046 2018-03-21 14:41:23 My turmeric one is a kind of every few days type toothpaste but seeing as my salt water/essential oil mix is working so well id def like to try a more permanent toothpaste swap. Toothpaste + shampoo are probs the harder toiletries to make the switch from.
5047 2018-03-21 14:41:22 I accidentally cooked my eggs in too much oil and then it got hot and splashed on my pants.  Look out everyone, I'm a business professional
5048 2018-03-21 14:41:01 Yes, girl..order a set of oils from amazon or Groupon. My bath routine is completely chemical free aside from shampoo.  I use raw Shea butter, raw African black soap, coconut oil, Epsom salt, oatmeal, baking soda and ESSENTIAL OILS.  LIFE. Your body will thank you. 
5049 2018-03-21 14:40:59 It's not Canadian oil I hate, and I am not naive that we have a ways to go. But a fool does the same thing over and over and expects a new result. I am glad you have solar, yes it's not perfect but you can ship energy and building more pipelines isn't the answer.
5050 2018-03-21 14:40:52 I was in PH earlier the black soot underneath my feet was overwhelming. It needs urgent attention . Enough of the oil menace . People first , Port Harcourt first

5052 2018-03-21 14:40:43 am new to actually participating in the Twitterverse - pardon my inexperience with the format. as a long term "insider" in the business, have been simultaneously impressed and uneasy about the technical accuracy of @BlairKing_ca re TM operations. unease is an oil business thing

5072 2018-03-21 14:38:50 Oh, I'm aware of this.
I also recognize the '23 "expectation" for combustion engines to no longer be in production (Germany) means Oil and Gas will plummet again.
An intelligent gvt will be looking at alternative revenues, and the Olympics will gather global attention to that

5081 2018-03-21 14:38:13 Oil is obviously an asset..but the debate pivots on *How significant a one*?

In indyref the figures put out by ScotGov were*£Thousands per head extra for everyone*-arising from the then high price.= unsustainable tax take & the difference in dividing the cash between 5 M & 65M+.
5082 2018-03-21 14:38:10 I wish I knew how to talk about cars bc when I get an oil change I am a deer in the headlights.

5100 2018-03-21 14:36:17 The nation's first court hearing on the science of climate change begins today in a lawsuit filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland that contends the world's biggest oil companies are liable for damages linked to climate change.
5101 2018-03-21 14:36:13 "It wasn't uncommon, Chazen said, for oil companies to spend $10 million drilling and pumping oil from a well and collect $11 million in total revenue over the life of that well. That translates into a 10 percent return over five years, or a mere 2 percent per year"

5108 2018-03-21 14:35:27 Since I know many of you are pet owners, please be aware that the recent high winds have washed up palm oil onto the beaches.

pure palm oil has a laxative effect on dogs, which can cause serious illness, but it's also often used to clean diesel tanks on ships and so can be toxic
5109 2018-03-21 14:35:24 Truth be told I don't like the wars either. They're a waste, and for what? We didn't need the oil. That being said I lay that whole mess at the feet of the neocon/neolib establishment and I'm happy to watch their sad slide into irrelevance.

5260 2018-03-21 14:21:58 Nice trying to be intelligent.  France and Germany congratulated Putin as well. Have you forgotten US are still on the ground in Syria finishing off Isis and Russia flys NASA astronauts to and from the international space station?  France and Germany get the oil from Russia

5550 2018-03-21 13:53:58 I’ve tried two different locations to get my oil changed but to no avail. Where I normally go, there was a minimum two hour wait. My back up was out of oil. LOL - so okay I won’t be getting it changed this morning clearly. 
5551 2018-03-21 13:53:53 they don't even work that great too.
i've seen some reviews and they can't match oil frying.
5552 2018-03-21 13:53:35 No worries, I’m sure you were down with the prospect of little change in this area but I’m sure it was worth the dice roll. Farage on the other hand was selling snake oil

5554 2018-03-21 13:53:24 Yes, we do need to be # 1 to not be held hostage to the middle eastern oil barons and OPEC. The solar and wind can continue to grow. Many families depend on oil production. So it’s a mix that can continue to slide to green.

Only unionist make an issue of currency,,its no big deal
5577 2018-03-21 13:51:29 What we sell to the rest of Africa is mostly oil. Difficult to substitute. Our oil sector is less than 2% of our labor market, so the effect on employment will be negligible.

On the other hand, a flooding of our market with cheap goods will likely kill our limited manufacturing

5645 2018-03-21 13:44:13 A few of them buy into this idea that if they stop supporting, they will lose the “indirect” war with Iran. Others don’t want to hurt Saudis because there’s money, oil, etc involved + it’s friendship will be in shambles.

5738 2018-03-21 13:35:28 This is proven by westminster fighting to keep scots in union.

5741 2018-03-21 13:35:15 So to produce 1 kg of soy oil you actually have to produce 5 kg of soybeans. That’s equal to 1 kg of oil plus 4 kg of soymeal. Humans eat and use the oil, have little use for the meal (aside from tofu) which is why it’s fed to animals. It’s not rocket science, just simple maths.

5744 2018-03-21 13:34:51 Simple solution B.C. - Ban “All Tanker Traffic” from these routes and send them out to the Pacific on the “Long Route”? You won’t make any Friends, but you would reinforce your argument to prevent Alberta Oil from being loaded and transported across your Pristine Waters?

5765 2018-03-21 13:32:41 Incorrect. Take sweetcorn as an example. Of the entire plant, only a tiny fraction is edible - the kernels on the corn. The rest (90+%) is waste. Soy meal accounts for ~80% of the mass of a soy bean (the oil is ~20%) - that does not mean they have the same economic value.

5789 2018-03-21 13:29:43 There's truth to the fact that scorpions don't like lavender. I put some lavender oil next to a scorpion in the garage and he went running, well wiggling away @SchwartzTV #azwx #nvwx #cawx

5821 2018-03-21 13:26:30 So it has come to this.. right.. this piece was written by the other Jonas Giæver. A real snake's oil man. Sells berries by the freeway around Montevideo somewhere. The type that kicks puppies in the face and strokes his long, elegant moustache. Big United fan. Only flies United.
5822 2018-03-21 13:26:30 oh I see, so one of the first time the oil had gotten really hot and thin?  Could well be; hope that's it!

5827 2018-03-21 13:25:50 I should be grateful none of my cats do the flicking minis off the table trick sometimes the odd paint pot disappears under the table, the worst case was when Molly knocked over my Nuln Oil with her tail. 
5828 2018-03-21 13:25:49 So I tried an oil cleanser, Wanted 2see what kbeauty was about. I’m sad. I really liked the cleanser itself and USING it. It smells amazing. Feels like softy soft on my face. But holy shit my skin was NOT having it. The insanely enormous face dot is finally clearing. Praise be.

5837 2018-03-21 13:25:14 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.

Samsara by Guerlain eau de parfum since I was 20.

However - the full layering involves bathing in lavender and patchouli oil, cattier vanilla / cocoa cream, also some lavender cream around the décollete, weleda skin food on feet.
5839 2018-03-21 13:25:01 It's a shame you wise Albertans didn't invest in your own refineries with all that oil wealth... 

Then you wouldn't have to be celebrating the most banal events like a victory. #cdnpoli

5918 2018-03-21 13:17:09 Wage growth is apparently about to go higher than inflation. I'd be tempted to say "what wage growth"?
If wage growth carries on unabated, can't it have a feedback impact on inflation?

One advantage perlite has over another pozzolan like flash ash is its ability to consume and hold more water. Both can be used on the oil field
5920 2018-03-21 13:16:57 Drip lukewarm oil twice a day and give ur ears a thorough flush during shower. Don't stuff anything into the ear, that'll just make it worse. Flexing ur jaw by gaping can be somewhat helpful. Gods speed.
5921 2018-03-21 13:16:57 Cholesterol is certainly a big player.  As are salt, smoking and booze.  Eating a Mediterranean-style diet (high in fresh fruit and veg, olive oil, fish and lean meat) has been known for a very long time to be a good way of ensuring heart health.

5931 2018-03-21 13:15:47 I switched to $GUSH when I saw Oil holding up a couple of days ago with SPY deep red. But I sold way too early, didn’t expect this Oil move this quick
5932 2018-03-21 13:15:42 the best feeling when my co-army gave me an each pack of tea tree oil mask and moisturizer mask on btsxmediheal box set   i feel so blessed
5933 2018-03-21 13:15:41 I’ve never used it. But yeah I typically add the cream, gel, and oil to the section first & then detangle because it’s super slippery then (especially when the hair is wet). But most OGX conditioners + tresemme’s cheap conditioners are very slippery
5934 2018-03-21 13:15:29 Interesting thought
“Data pools are the new oil and algorithms are the new refineries”
5935 2018-03-21 13:15:23 Was watching Fox Business this morning and noticed that the speculators on Wall Street were driving the price of Crude Oil up for their profits today. Increasing it will only increase inflation. This will only throw us into recession!

5939 2018-03-21 13:15:08 At the end of the day, it’s all about heredity. But a great organic solution is, lavender oil, DO NOT wet your hair when you get in the shower every time, only wash and condition hair 1/2 times a week, exercise, diet, and rest

5958 2018-03-21 13:13:37 All social media companies are "surveillance capitalist" TBH Google is much more pervasive than FB. These companies need broken up & regulated. They have much more power than oil or banks ever dreamed of having. Our laws have not kept up w tech.
5959 2018-03-21 13:13:27 A concept: if, like someone who is not me, you like to feign living #LuxeLife with extra-foamy shower gel, don't scrimp to buy a cheaper one, in order to save just £1. Because it will have tea tree oil in. And, as someone totally not me can tell you, without being explicit. Oww.

5989 2018-03-21 13:10:57 If the republicans could let go of the private parts of big oil, wind and solar would be enough. 
Solar started out heating tubes of water to give you hot water. Now they produce electricity. Wind ground grain, now also produces electricity. We cut off innovation for coal n oil.
5990 2018-03-21 13:10:44 I don’t think so. I have a feeling mine is hormonal too. I drink tons of water but my diet is a bit hit and miss. I do have some hyper pigmentation which is why I’ve started using bio oil.

6035 2018-03-21 13:05:54 I was looking at Puerto Rico's power strategy, sloar+storage is $75/ Mwh, vs $150-200 for imported oil. Cheap storage is key. And for most houses a car with a 600m range solid state battery would be the main source of storage, particularly given peak demand is after the commute.

6071 2018-03-21 13:02:10 Fair point(s). 
Here and now, we know Refiners'll face a structural change (more LS, less HS) in the type of fuel(s) they'll need to supply in the context of unchanged overall fuel(s) demand. 
The net impact on the demand of Oil grades remains unclear though, at least to me.

6076 2018-03-21 13:01:38 Nah, that’s the soup and cooking oil aisle. But let me tell you, the fireworks one row over, where you get your carts tangled perusing the cereal, are worthy of at least one Lifetime movie. “Love in Aisle Seven” Writes itself.

6112 2018-03-21 12:57:21 And there are declassified US documents from the 1970s showing that back then, the EU planned on revaluing their gold much higher in order to settle EU oil deficits with the Arab world.  Those accusing me of "crazy conspiracy theories" are merely not as well read apparently...

6114 2018-03-21 12:57:17 Soybeans of Brazil, Argentina and Russia are good alternatives for US soybeans. China can also use peanut to produce cooking oil. However, it’s hard for the US to find replacement for industry intermediate goods from China. The US had better not get so sure about itself.

6200 2018-03-21 12:55:15 Governments never ending quest for revenue thru taxation. Next will be a tax on fat and saturated fat in food products. Then a salt tax, caffeine tax, cooking oil tax, etc etc.

6270 2018-03-21 12:48:09 Thanks! Both are important. It just amazes me that Statoil, who are 90%+ oil and gas, boasts about being a leader in fighting climate change. This is like being someone who has said that they are gving up smoking, but all they have done is switched to vaping at the weekend.

I would like to see some companies look into creating large scale "rosin" production.  

funny thing is, most probably dont even know what rosin is.

A superior extract to oil and shatter.

Healthiest extraction possible.

6289 2018-03-21 12:46:29 Crude oil prices were boosted by signs the global oil glut is shrinking faster than expected after data from Joint Technical Committee of OPEC & non-OPEC nations sowed global oil inventories in Feb were 44 million bbl above the 5-yr average, down from 74 million bbl above in Jan.

6305 2018-03-21 12:45:08 this comes from halting demand - no sale no need to produce. We have to educate that palm oil is extremely unhealthy + need to ban use.

6319 2018-03-21 12:44:10 But don't give Sk too much credit for their accidental carbon sinks. The province is selling off land and allowing native prairie to be tilled anywhere that it is profitable for ag or oil.
6320 2018-03-21 12:44:02 Wonder were you following City before the oil money in 2008 or if you had you even heard of them thenvery much doubt it

6377 2018-03-21 12:38:34 The fact that the USA insist on occupying the rich oil fields in Syria, shows the USA/Israel has no intentions of looking for Peace. US actions are a disrespect to Syria.  What is being done is wrong,  It is time Syria make stink war with US/Israel to stop claims on their soil...
6378 2018-03-21 12:38:23 It's still not clear to me what net impact of this will be.
Is it a matter of ad hoc refining capacity upgrade? 
Or of what LFSO market price break-evens the capacity upgrade? 
Or of prospect structural scarcity of LFSO no matter what? 
Or of whether there'll be enough Sour Oil?

6506 2018-03-21 12:24:53 That is not the confirmatory test of Olive Oil ( Extra Virgin) . The only confirmatory test is a lab pwrformed Free Fatty acid level that needs to be between 0.0 % to 0.8 %  ( acidity) . NinasAlmeriaGold has acidity 0.1% . Premium Green Olives pressed for extra virgin oil

6531 2018-03-21 12:20:53 Coco oil and butter is comedogenic which means it blocks the pores. I wouldn't recommend it.

6534 2018-03-21 12:20:29 I disagree - Think of it as an engine - Would you object to putting in oil and prefer to pay for a rebuild when the engine seized?
6535 2018-03-21 12:20:17 On Twitter, Jared Kushner fails to convince Omarosa Manigault that oil executives are hiring lobbyists. Charles Krauthammer quotes the Quran.

6569 2018-03-21 12:15:54 Sticking up for fundamentals of economics, nothing else. Where you work, that business sets their price. US oil companies, however, have their price set by the market. By the principles of supply and demand. So when refiners go down, the market responds- whether up or down.

6617 2018-03-21 12:08:51 Not so fast. Economies run on oil. China is going to be the biggest consumer on the planet and the US the biggest oil producer (Saudi oil fields are spent). US has the biggest military. US has a strong negotiating tool.

6620 2018-03-21 12:08:43 So @CambridgeAnalytica did their sales pitch to oil firm/Russian govt vehicle Lukoil, which never followed through with a contract, yet Russia then deployed CA like methodologies in Trump's election. Bets the FSB simply lifted the CA databases once they knew what to look for?
6621 2018-03-21 12:08:42 has nothing to do with them having crypto and everything to do with Oil. USD is the petro dollar anyone dealing oil in the world has to convert to USD first to buy that oil. This crypto takes that away from the US just like China is introducing petro yuan next week. bad for U.S

6665 2018-03-21 12:03:50 The same guys who were saying 'NO' to coconut oil some time ago must be using only coconut oil now completely avoiding refined oil.

6800 2018-03-21 11:45:03 I haven’t traded oil in several weeks and I definitely made the right choice. Let’s see if this chop continues in this tight range.

6803 2018-03-21 11:44:37 Unfortunately, this is becoming a time we can't vote with our wallets and stock purchases like I've advocated for decades. We must push our lawmakers into seeing the risks and prevent these titan organizations from existing.  Like we did with big oil long ago

6806 2018-03-21 11:43:56 That's what I do with root veg most of the time, honestly! Carrots, parsnips, red onion, garlic, and leeks in a pan, drizzled with olive oil, seasoned, roasted, then drizzled with balsamic vinegar.
6807 2018-03-21 11:43:47 yes, I've heard this too, but what oil? Available in UK?

6815 2018-03-21 11:42:55 Wrong. The US has trillions in auto system infrastructure. All its eggs are in one basket. If China or Russia control Kirkuk oil they will have huge leverage over US economy. Arms sales are trivial of n comparison.

6826 2018-03-21 11:40:47 No one has any researched to determine this is the cause. Oil companies have been operating for a while and this is very recent. Typical gas flares will not give off soot. Bunkering is plausible, but as with the above has been on for far longer than the soot, so??

6874 2018-03-21 11:35:25 Behind the scenes, for creation and storage I think we'd go by label 'type' - get to a common schema for roads, buildings, land class, etc. So a complete 'chip' would need 5-10 foundational label types. And anyone can contribute an extra type - 'oil well pad', etc

6950 2018-03-21 11:23:30 Do you moisturise? If you don't your skin produces more oil, try oil less face washes and day cream. Try face masks as well. aloe Vera is good for oily yet sensitive skin
6951 2018-03-21 11:23:29 Bleach is an amazing chemical. I thought we'd need new dishrags. We only have 2, I live with a pig and the house is a disaster area when I come back from work trips. They looked like they'd been used in an oil change but now they look brand new from soaking overnight.

7005 2018-03-21 11:13:56 I just read Wikileaks Hillary emails during Benghazi era. French President Sarkozy 
(who is now detained by French Police), turned against Gaddafi for the oil, etc., in the end. Fair weather friend he was...taking his money, then participated in destroying him. What a guy...
7006 2018-03-21 11:13:50 Will this follow same blueprint as Gaddafi's Dinar, based in Gold (or other minerals eg. oil too)? I'd like to know more about it, for example who will print it, and how much etc.

7013 2018-03-21 11:12:14 Mind your own business, not America’s concern, it’s all about oil and the fact Venezuela wants to stop using the dollar, same as Saddam, Gaddafi, Iran, Russia, where’s the humanity for Myanmar refugees, people starving to death and America does nothing.

7106 2018-03-21 10:57:58 What is merely ‘rhetorical’ about saving  oil is needed for all the petrochemical products that we all use everything single day? What is rhetorical about saying that oil (or coal!) is needed for diesel to power other industrial activities?

7218 2018-03-21 10:39:37 Oil prices rose and exchange rates fell, so 'subsidy' returned as prices were 'fixed'. But my earlier point is that the govt spending  less on subsidy did not have any positive impact I can relate to, whilst my spending more on fuel was a real and immediate impact on my finances.

7252 2018-03-21 10:34:28 Absolutely, I agree with you there. The big problem with the PSUV was in their decision not decisively clamp down on the reactionaries and build an economy that wouldn't be subject to multinational sabotage or the price of oil and its fluctuations.

In any event, this coordinate election tactic has been organized.

7363 2018-03-21 10:13:21 Europe uses cheap Russian gas to compete with the US. Paying more would make their products cost much more which is why I support high prices for Europe. Right now Asia pays 25% more for both oil and gas as they have no alternatives like in Europe. Why Turkey wants Russian gas.
7364 2018-03-21 10:13:16 Oh fuck off Dean, why don’t you go home and have a wank with coconut oil and have a cry over Davina  #mafs

France & others have significantly more farmland than the UK so why isn't that resource on the EU table for sharing with UK?

7502 2018-03-21 09:42:52 Cambridge Analytica are snake oil merchants. Trump lost the popular vote despite their services being sought. They should be behind bars for defrauding clients.
7503 2018-03-21 09:42:50 Teaching people, particularly women, a series of floppy palm strikes, groin kicks, wrist twists and improbable bear hug escapes should be legislated against. 

It is self-defence snake oil and puts people in danger.

7688 2018-03-21 09:16:00 There's actually nothing called “world's best olive oil”. Making high-quality olive oil isn't a piece of cake. The difference between the good and the best depends on a taster's preference, which always differs.
7689 2018-03-21 09:15:38 #IToldYouSo Yes, all the pics you see of citrus in infusions have the peel still on bc it's pretty, but it's just too bitter. Limes are particularly strong. Lots of oil, as you've found. Just peel well, remove all pith & seeds. You just want slices of flesh. Then it's Yum.

8044 2018-03-21 08:00:30 Orange extract (made from skins and orange oil) is different than orange blossom extract (made from flowers). Best to use what the recipe indicates.
8045 2018-03-21 08:00:29 Can you get some lavender essential oil anywhere? A few drops on pillow just before get into bed. Helped me a lot when I couldn’t sleep. Also, 1 hour minimum no IT; no caffeinated drinks 6 hours before bed.  What won’t help is your crazy, all over the place, work/sleep patterns.
8046 2018-03-21 08:00:23 I very much agree with the Prime Minister. And the earlier we start marketing our oil sand, the better for the well-being of our economy as a nation.

8061 2018-03-21 07:58:39 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

8064 2018-03-21 07:58:14 But do you agree that there are people who have made their mark and fortune here without being in the oil and gas sector? Most people are only concerned with leaving this country without first trying out their chances here, it's hard no doubt but we should try.
8065 2018-03-21 07:58:07 Good morning Martin, I agree with you,  no tanker no oil,   but... We collect new data, new information from BB,  so let's hope so we use those informations later this year when we get back to BB after positive HH DISCOVERY.

Avoid using towels except it’s a clean towel to pat dry else your shaved parts might get infections. 

Use a mixture of olive and tea tree oil on shaved parts.

8078 2018-03-21 07:55:17 It finally seems like Canadians are waking up to paid pseudo protesters/lobby groups pretending to be sincere citizens. About time we took back democracy and the good of the country. Oh, P.S., Canadian oil is the most environmental thing any person who cares about earth can do.
8079 2018-03-21 07:55:13 it's comical because it is the most honest expression of what the relationship is about, arms, oil and money. I think MBS is confused by the honesty.

8085 2018-03-21 07:54:23 Only a menace because he threatened oil supply to US
8086 2018-03-21 07:53:52 Micheal Cole, the guy on camera 4 , That fat dude who used to come to the ring rubbing oil all over himself, Donald Trumps Gardener & the manager of my local post office!
8087 2018-03-21 07:53:18 The next time we are lobbying our causes, join in! Always love a bit of evidence...as rare as that is with the pro oil discussion!
8088 2018-03-21 07:53:17 Only lasting solution is to have shore based  water refineries on line of oil, deploy water tankers on sea routes and distribute water at pump like petrol.
8089 2018-03-21 07:53:08 Françafric, Angolagate, affaire Karachi, guerre civile au Congo-Brazzaville, affaire Elf, soupçon de financement libyen... bon sang, mais où est le point commun ?

8091 2018-03-21 07:52:48 See now I am confused. So the weald oilers see it as positive where as Martin sees it as disappointing with no oil.
So from that I guess we have to wait for the RNS?

8162 2018-03-21 07:31:55 That's why states like Wyoming & Texas have such atrocious education ratings, not to mention teacher pay. Education comes last. Oil, gas, & coal come first. The Wyo. Leg. actually tried to give tax breaks to fossil fuel companies & increase those on renewable energy.

Drilling holes in sediments for oil & gas, 20% porosity to "several km" and 5% to "10+ km" would not raise eyebrows. The Kola Superdeep borehole was still getting pore fluids at 12km, and the German KTB at 11.7km too, both in granitic upper crust.

However, that is mostly because these are new wells in their flush period, it isn't a statement about their overall performance.

US brought liberty and freedom to millions of Iraqi's by sending them to the next life. Iraqi's should be tankful for that. US also gets 250 billion barrels of prime oil fields to plunder.. What more could any greedy slimy imperialist ask for.

8743 2018-03-21 05:29:34 1) Thanks for the responses. You still didnt respond to the original statements though. Also, I dont think anyone is denying there was/is some serious economic mismanagement going on, that not diversifying away from oil was a major mistake, the failure to tackle corruption also
8744 2018-03-21 05:29:26 This oil pen is no joke, I’m fucking high and this OG Kush oil taste amazing

8759 2018-03-21 05:27:12 It could be worse, he could’ve gone and worked for BP or some other oil company that destroyed the environment and killed thousands of animals and cause cancer to locals, which I think is worse than some upset sports fans

8762 2018-03-21 05:26:31 Yesterday I cracked open the door for the pizza guy and his weird ass gon’ breathe in hard asf talking about “Coconut. I love it”
I just realized today that I had coconut oil in my hair. It’s the fact that he smelled it through the door that has me shooketh.
8763 2018-03-21 05:26:30 Yep! I'm an expert at infusing oil and butter. Now for something new!
8764 2018-03-21 05:26:26 Yup. Hello GW Bush.  So he could earn daddy's love, he manufactured the whole WMD B.S. so he could attack Iraq and avenge the failed attempt of GHW Bush's assassination by Hussein's gov't.  GW should've taken up oil painting a lot sooner.

8767 2018-03-21 05:25:45 I think that’s probably where almost everyone is. There should be as much geothermal and hydro and wind as we can sustain, and our backup should be nuclear power, not coal or oil or natural gas.
8768 2018-03-21 05:25:37 The cloud is too big! Imagine if a hacker uses a plane to fly into the cloud. We as a society would be ruined! That’s why I propose storing our data deep at the center of the earth. We just gotta take precautions that we don’t store the data near any potential oil mines
8769 2018-03-21 05:25:33 Complaint of oil slippage at 9.47 pm. Police "reply" at 11.44 pm. What a speed Sir?  You deserve a salary hike. BTW when was action taken? In the morning? That's the difference between Navi Mumbai police and @MumbaiPolice. They're far more swift, in same salary. Shame on you.

8782 2018-03-21 05:23:28 I’ve got a REN milk cleanser for the morning and Emma Hardy balm cleanser in the evening. Then a gentle toner then I have a salicylic acid (not every day) on the spot areas. Then Bio oil on old spot areas. Then hyaluronic acid then a moisturiser.
8783 2018-03-21 05:23:26 My go-to coffee used to be a salted caramel latte. But for a few months I have been doing two shots of espresso mixed with a caramel protein shake on ice, two pumps of sugar free salted caramel flavoring, and a tablespoon of MCT oil.

8790 2018-03-21 05:22:09 I recommend baked or roasted potatoes of some sort or other. Like cube-cut red potatoes tossed in olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary, and a bit of salt. Then baked at 375 for 20 min, turned and baked another 20 min. :9
8791 2018-03-21 05:21:46 I’m not sure what’s triggered mine tbh. I’ve got a REN milk cleanser for the morning and Emma Hardy balm in the evening. Then a toner then I have a salicylic acid (not every day) on the spot areas. Then Bio oil on old spot areas. Then hyaluronic acid then moisturiser.
8792 2018-03-21 05:21:44 Trump does what he wants, when he wants, without fear of repercussions. Those that speak up like John McCain are ignored. Controversy drives this snake oil salesman to perform a multitude of ignominious feats. Sarah Sanders defends him with vigor and he's off to the next disaster

8801 2018-03-21 05:20:27 Seriously, WTF are u on.  This entire thread is about oil exploration - u bought up Norway going to electric flight

Yes, I fully realise this is a state initiative, Norway is essentially an oil state thats how they r a 1st World nation let alone fund this initiative.
8802 2018-03-21 05:19:55 BTW Russia OIL co Luxoil also contacted CA to get data on American voters - Why???? CA lied about Ryssian accounts.

8803 2018-03-21 05:19:35 I looked into working in Alberta back in the LATE 90's. The money offered was really good, but I wouldn't wish the oil sands on ANYONE. There ain't enough $$ in the world to get my ass into those fields again.
8804 2018-03-21 05:19:29 I even remember hearing plots of a gold and oil base for the African currency. They shot that nigga Muammar
8805 2018-03-21 05:19:28 Yup no problem. Just ship billions of barrels of oil from Saudia Arabia because we can't get Alberta oil.  You realize the foreign oil will travel further distances than using our own Canadian products.

8823 2018-03-21 05:17:06 Selling oil well below world prices due to export & capacity constraints by being land locked is better? US is laughing all the way to the bank. Double hulled tankers with modern NAV system, pilots & tug boats very very safe. Canada needs tax $ & Asia oil. Others happy to sell it

8845 2018-03-21 05:12:07 It's been forum here, forum there. No implementation. Nigeria still depend greatly on oil and with the corruption eye opening economy we find ourselves in, it can't change.

9011 2018-03-21 04:38:08 @SchwartzDefense I'm guessing the recent spike in oil prices has been a direct result of the amount of grease you put in your hair.
9012 2018-03-21 04:38:07 Google och Amazon är vår tids Standard Oil.
9013 2018-03-21 04:38:03 Yes... That is why it's so hard to adapt the free energy... Oil is the black gold

9026 2018-03-21 04:35:55 I’m no political genius but how about we give all the oil licenses to Air NZ and they can only use it to get fuel for provincial services.

9032 2018-03-21 04:34:01 Tea tree oil lightens those scars and also helps to restore the skin’s natural oil balance. Plus, it’s able to penetrate deeply into the pores to remove toxins and prevent clogging that can cause acne in the first place.

9040 2018-03-21 04:33:02 Reagan tried that ghost ship resuscitation only to be mothballed again. What a waste. Dad hates working on that junk. He also dislikes commercial repairs on oil tankers.

9050 2018-03-21 04:31:44 That's because kyaks and canoes are indigenous designs from North America and the Sub Arctic that were copied in plastic to suit mass consumerism and the lack of talent to replicate the original crafts, cost effectively. Let's not give "oil" credit for kyaks, for Christ sake!!!
9051 2018-03-21 04:31:42 mix castor oil into your shampoo and massage it into your scalp when u shower, made my hair grow faster
9052 2018-03-21 04:31:29 See! Immediately they start pushing to attack Syria. Just clean out the ME for oil and other exploitation.
9053 2018-03-21 04:31:15 the reason why y’all edges is thin and nonexistent is because instead of washing out the edge control y’all put on them, y’all keep it on there and add more daily. your scalp needs to breathe sis. wash your edges every night and oil them afterwards.

9058 2018-03-21 04:30:25 The Republican director of the EPA is openly whoring out the environment to his former clients in the oil and gas industry.
9059 2018-03-21 04:30:14 That is nice indeed. But Modi ji announces free gas connections, but now why oil companies r deducting connection charges from the subsidy of beneficiaries. Kindly keep promise for free gas connection in Ujjwala yogna
9060 2018-03-21 04:30:13 Chef Marc brought white truffle oil to class today

9068 2018-03-21 04:29:12 That's so oddly specific. I guess you want to make it clear that you're okay with the 5 tankers per month that bring foreign oil inbound to Vancouver... You only object to outbound tankers? Why's that?

Stop pretending you're a big club. You're a rich mans, human rights denying, play thing.

When the oil money goes, so will you  Enjoy it while it lasts.
9076 2018-03-21 04:26:54 I guess Syria has no oil ... so no one cares ...

9081 2018-03-21 04:25:25 No they don’t: Alberta has the oil!! And that, my friend, is 100% Canadian!! Don’t tell me we don’t have pipelines, when we sign a deal to make a pipeline down south to supply the Americans! And, make another to go to BC!
9082 2018-03-21 04:25:04 EVERYTHING TRUMP TOUCHES ENDS UP A LIE OR ILLEGAL, like his tax scam to put money in HIS OWN POCKET. Just like he's trying to get all the oil and minerals etc from opening up OUR national monuments and the oceans and Alaska. He's taking Americans for STOOGES.
9083 2018-03-21 04:25:03 When you just tryna cook but you and the frying pan with oil doesn't have a good relationship, why you hurt me? Huhu haha
9084 2018-03-21 04:24:34 Mix coconut oil and coarse sugar together for a body scrub that will leave your skin feeling super soft.

9086 2018-03-21 04:24:26 Coconut oil is so good for you. You can cook with it, use it for your hair or skin, to help heal wounds, or you can put it in hot drinks, like coffee with unsalted butter and a little bit of vanilla.

9097 2018-03-21 04:22:12 The argument you retweeted is weak. Environmentalists are not anti-oil/tanker. We need oil, as mentioned, for products, medical equip., etc. We are slaves to an oil-based economy. You can't blame the victim when they drink the water the jailer provides!  #stopKM #protecttheinlet
9098 2018-03-21 04:21:41 I really do put so much shit on my face every night lol tonight’s cocktail was an AHA/BHA scrub, Bio Oil, retinol eye cream, salicylic acid powder, and coconut oil
9099 2018-03-21 04:21:16 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. 
9100 2018-03-21 04:20:49 What do I know, but the intuitive meaning of a "spot" market should require delivery? Delivering crude oil isn't cheap either.
9101 2018-03-21 04:20:09 Clearly not the thoughts of a person who has thought deeply on the issue of opening an entire ecosystem to irreversible damage at a time when there is relatively weak demand for oil.
9102 2018-03-21 04:19:59 .That ill/uninformed tweet proves an apple never falls far from that Criminals tree poisonous though it maybe. 1st unlike #Trump #Obama & the EU's 2014 sanctions that blocked international investment in Russia's energy sector worked as one of its largest oil suppliers shuttered.
9103 2018-03-21 04:19:59 Coconut oil has been wasting in my bed for at least 3 days now and I didn't get it up in time.

9132 2018-03-21 04:14:56 They’ve got to go to that session to tell lies about their terrorist proxies still slaughtering civilians in Syria, not to mention their forces there illegally - waiting to carve the country up for oil, granting rights to crony corporations

9149 2018-03-21 04:11:44 Mr. Hightower says the soybean chart is being driven by biodiesel, but that its mirroring of the crude oil pricing is simply because crude, and now soybean oil, are overall economy indicators.  Huh!

9158 2018-03-21 04:10:29 Of course. We screwed it up they take advantage. back in 86 when "we" tanked the price of oil to take down the "Evil Empire" Venezuela and many other one horse oil economies got wrecked.

9167 2018-03-21 04:08:24 @josie_maran Can I put a few drops of pure almond oil in your argon oil or would it taint it? I don't want to ruin it if you don't recommend.
9168 2018-03-21 04:08:19 I agree with a number of people and the best way to protest your dislike of the pipeline is to quit using any oil products all together. If the protesters numbers are so high this will definitely put a big dint in west coast oil consumption.
9169 2018-03-21 04:08:15 You wouldn't want your car's oil filter to become clogged with dirt; so why should it be the same for your body? This is where the saying “prevention is better than cure” comes in. By including #organicfoods into your diet, you can boost #immunity. #organicfarming

9292 2018-03-21 03:48:13 Half the world scratched their heads on Iraq’s decision to invade Kuwait. Why they asked. 
@UN calls on you to save democracy and you oblige. 
Everything after that was done by Saddam so the world hates him while you call food in exchange for Oil a charity.

9362 2018-03-21 03:38:27 Dramatically increasing oil and natural gas supply like Trump is doing and significantly strengthening KSA influence in ME is a much, much greater threat to Russia.
9363 2018-03-21 03:38:19 Cruise ships are also a major source of water pollution. They produce over 200,000 gallons of sewage which is mostly released in the ocean. Apart form that, they are also causing at least 35,000 gallons of water contamination due to oil spill.

9431 2018-03-21 03:28:51 Also, I know all eyes are on rates, oil, and reserve currency. But what about the speculation on a potential war over water? Am I naive to think there is a global water shortage that could be the next catalyst to a war in the next 10 yrs?

CIO: #Data is the new oil.

Me: Data is the new crude oil - for it to act as fuel for engine, it needs to extracted, refined, processed & provisions must be made when it spills.

9441 2018-03-21 03:26:39 Oil spills impact birds, marine mammals and fish. The company "Dawn" a dish soap brand, advertises that it helps save wildlife affected by oil spills. Do you guys think that the company does this in good conscience or for advertising purposes?  #Lesson10

9445 2018-03-21 03:26:11 Shame on Abadi. He got the oil wells of Kirkuk and black gold means money. He can spend it on the Ezidi areas he was so keen to get control of. Nearly four years later. No justice and no end to their suffering.
9446 2018-03-21 03:25:58 Kehlani fine af but she also looks like she bleeds motor oil if that makes sense
9447 2018-03-21 03:25:57 According to @illintentcomics , I cause hot oil to spit all over. Happens often when I fry. One time he was frying something & it suddenly started spitting 'cause I walked into the kitchen but stopped when I left.
Moral of the story: don't let me near you while you fry.

9451 2018-03-21 03:24:53 Both he and his foreign minister were educated in the West. Both have superlative English speech. Both have west leanings. Old King Salman knew this day would come. They must diversify beyond oil, which means western investments. Trump has established what he calls mid-east NATO.
9452 2018-03-21 03:24:53 Didn't the whistle blower flat out say they sold voter data to a Russian oil company?
9453 2018-03-21 03:24:48 Oil needs to be eliminated. Plain & Simple. It hasn’t been replaced out of sheer greed and laziness.

9456 2018-03-21 03:24:18 You can change your oil in your car, your brakes to make you stop better...you can change your clothes, your shampoo and deodorant...you can even change your friends... But if you can't change you in the midst of it all,   None of those other changes are relevant.
9457 2018-03-21 03:24:17 Even if somehow #WTC was even possible for Arab nomadic tribes. 
What did Iraq have to do with it? 

Humane US was doing charity by feeding humans in exchange for Oil after Desert Storm.

9458 2018-03-21 03:24:17 They don't want this war to end it makes too much money and all it costs are military personnel which saves the country even more.  911 was an inside job to get oil rights in the middle East and military personnel and their families get to pay the price
9459 2018-03-21 03:24:13 That's so sad, and I'm afraid our orangutans will be next, with the destruction of the rainforest for palm oil.

9463 2018-03-21 03:23:29 Follow the oil. Venezuela is a competitor to DJT & Putin,  I believe.
9464 2018-03-21 03:23:13 Strange stuff- why are oil names not going up with oil?

9482 2018-03-21 03:20:30 did you use oil to make these?
9483 2018-03-21 03:20:28 just made a coconut milk, almonds, elderberry syrup, chia seeds, spinach/kale, apple cider vinegar, ginger, coconut oil, and pineapple for my son.  I usually use bananas, substituted pineapple for his cough.
9484 2018-03-21 03:20:23 I feel like a complete newbie at this, but! Skincare twitter, I changed my moisturizer (I went with the Neutrogena gel with hyaluronic acid) and it has already helped the scaly bits under my eyes. My argan oil and squalane arrived today: when/where do I use them? All over? Night?
9485 2018-03-21 03:20:15 great thing is, if you don't want to go to an Oil Kings game you can hit up an AJHL game. 

I mean I rarely go to hockey games to see the players on my own team. lol. I usually go to see the great players on other teams.

9498 2018-03-21 03:18:06 Well firstly imo it does nothing for my hair, I think it’s bc it’s too thick of an oil. And it’s way too thick for the skin on ur face to be saturated in it, it clogs your pores. Face oils should be thinner like maracuja or Argan oil (my personal faves)

9509 2018-03-21 03:16:20 Essential oil blends for stress relief and sleep therapy, they were blended handcrafted for me. I highly recommend 

STRESS- pure black, spruce, sandalwood, frankincense, lavender, vanilla, and blue tansy
SLEEP- pure valerian, lavender, ylang ylang, and marjoram

9513 2018-03-21 03:15:17 I think somebody who claims to have the academic background you claim in your twitter bio has the wherewithal to realize there are 5 oil tankers out there right now (you claimed there was one) and investigate what else might be wrong.

9516 2018-03-21 03:14:34 I continue to be befuddled by the lack of questioning of the "public opinion surveys" that surround this issue. Asking residents of Camore, Banff, etc if they want Olympics is akin to asking Albertans if they want a return to $100/ barrel oil, IMO.
9517 2018-03-21 03:14:32 But we also shouldn't be using coal or oil at all

9583 2018-03-21 03:06:30 You figure the oil co's are gonna be keen on building Canadian refineries & upgraders, making it WTI-grade here then shipping it? Paying your ass a living wage to do it?
Cuz I think they'd prefer to pipe it to a boat & do it in China where people are disposable.
9584 2018-03-21 03:06:25 Took a nice shower, shaved and then used my new oil

We know your tricks, Andy.
9591 2018-03-21 03:05:45 Oil stick while I watch this ticket game.
9592 2018-03-21 03:05:31 There is nothing America first about shipping our oil overseas. It hurts the consumer at the expense of the multi-national companies. Drill baby drill meant keeping it here and us independent. Not drill baby and ship it overseas.
9593 2018-03-21 03:05:23 Went in for a oil change this morning and drove back home in a new car. lol
9594 2018-03-21 03:05:21 i don't have any tea tree oil i don't think so hopefully this helps

9602 2018-03-21 03:04:29 Shale is cheap abundant & much cleaner than coal & oil. We need to harness renewables to compliment it until wind, solar, or some new tech can compete. We can’t spend ourselves green, Muskrat is evidence of colossal waste & horrible consumer costs needlessly. Backward thinking.
9603 2018-03-21 03:04:25 "omg try not to get bitten by mosquitoes again" oh buddy. thanks for the concern but I live in a place where those fuckers never die. unless you bathe in citronella oil you pretty much just learn to live with it and hope for the best.

9619 2018-03-21 03:02:49 I was going to say something similar to you! We always notice when an oil spill occurs for example, its hard to cover up. but carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, poisonous gas, we might not realize when there is a spill perhaps?
9620 2018-03-21 03:02:39 Oh so Big Oil is trying to get in on this now?

Dubai has been transformed into a baron desert into traveling destination
9674 2018-03-21 02:57:25 You're a war-monger too Tony. What made it worth our while to involve ourselves in this destabilising catastrophic war? How was Saddam any more of a menace than any other despot? Why didn't you encourage us to invade North Korea? Did oil have anything to do with it?
9675 2018-03-21 02:57:17 It would be great if people were aware of end of life emissions being sent offsite from BC coal as well. It is comparable to oil sands but not one peep. It is also expected to increase.

9700 2018-03-21 02:53:04 The fundamental truth is that Kinder Morgan would not be going through all this grief for a 50% increase in oil export. It will be at least 3x to 5x or even more.

9706 2018-03-21 02:51:24 The trade deficit is kept artificially high because Canada deliberately keeps it’s dollar artificially low vs US dollar. Also, if US had to pay fair World price for Canadian oil, those numbers would change dramatically.

9721 2018-03-21 02:49:25 he basically said that he doh like dougla girls cuz we look like we mixed with oil and dirt. I remember I posted a pic of myself with a caption of whatever the oil price was at that time
9722 2018-03-21 02:48:50 @rominamanguel Sobre OIL Combustibles, hay que aclarar que la planta de San Lorenzo está parada hace tiempo . No está generando ingresos. Las estaciones no están recibiendo combustible. La situación es gravisima. Los estaciones y  empleados están desesperados. #AnimalesSueltos

9731 2018-03-21 02:47:53 Another GOP debacle.  He should be tried as a war criminal.  What a waste of lives and money to protect oil interests.
9732 2018-03-21 02:47:53 That would be more desirable than some of the things they have to do. Having to prep and cook on a hammock, have to get all your ingredients out of a tank filled with dark oil, etc.

9745 2018-03-21 02:46:30 Lavender essential oil is supposed to help you calm down, right? Cause it’s not working. I’m still mad about that game.
9746 2018-03-21 02:46:28 Affordable energy technology hasn’t caught up w/the wishes for clean energy. Carbon footprint of wind turbines never break even due to manufacturing of the turbines. Until technology improves, oil and gas is what we have. Being dependent on others for energy is national sec risk.

9759 2018-03-21 02:44:51 Oil and popcorn have 'lives' separate from each other, but together...together they are utterly amazing!
9760 2018-03-21 02:44:43 This is childish nonsense. If somehow every US oil company went out of business and stopped producing, it would mean nothing. China and India burn coal and oil in excess of what the US does.
9761 2018-03-21 02:44:38 But very scared of corporations, private prisons, military industrial complex, oil and gas companies, and the intelligence agencies.
9762 2018-03-21 02:44:38 Igor runs oil company Rosneft, made a deal w/ExxonMobil (Tillerson) in 2011, for prospecting & extracting oil from the Black Sea shelf, ExxonMobil to invest $1 billion.  Trump blocked it. I believe they also bought an oil company in Oregon.
9763 2018-03-21 02:44:07 WAIT y'all didn't tell me that was oil and dirt boy?!? I'm hurt. Y'all fake.
9764 2018-03-21 02:44:04 It's in some of my hair products, and it seems to work well with other oils.  Good to know about pimples, though I'm too afraid to use straight oil w/ my acne-prone skin.

Instead, you call them that oil company that's like a total dog, that company that's all about telling the future, the one that sounds like a bell, or that one full of saps.

Wind power farms are much less deadly than domestic cats and urban sprawl.

Irrelevant to DDT discussion.
9816 2018-03-21 02:37:57 Your analysis has a big blind spot in geopolitics.  Petrodollar started w oil but grew/developed based on a network effect around USD/debt mkts which remain supported by USD monopoly on oil/commodity pricing.  Fmr senior CIA & State Dept officials have confirmed as much.

9896 2018-03-21 02:27:37 I have facts you just have insults.  You'll be surprised how many refineries in Asia who can't refine our heavy oil.  The new TransMountain expansion can also deliver refined oil and help keep our high paying refinery jobs in Canada.
9897 2018-03-21 02:27:34 I loved my internal oil heater. I miss that thing. Sure sucked electricity though.

9901 2018-03-21 02:27:23 Wrong. Congress authorized the Iraq war for oil. ONLY the late Senator Byrd, a Dixiecrat, spoke eloquently & voted AGAINST the war. I cried when he finished, as I KNEW Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 al-Qaeda, that 1000s would die for Cheney's #OilLust

9906 2018-03-21 02:27:03 Q: how can we have an oil shortage in our country? Simple answer: #OilShortage101 Nobody bothered2 check the oil. Didn't know we're getting low. Reason: purely geographical. The oil is located in Alaska, Cali, Okla, and TX. The #dipsticks are all in Washington DC. #JokeOfTheDay
9907 2018-03-21 02:26:57 Every Sunday I do things to promote self love to myself & to better my mental/physical health. I call this “love yourself Sunday’s”.

9910 2018-03-21 02:26:09 Nigeria's FX reserve is largely made up of dollars.And 80% of Nigeria's dollar receipts comes from oil sales. Hence, 2 things that guarantee fx reserve growth oil productn numbers and oil prices. FPI and FDI contribute a paltry sum. So is the CBN to thank for oil price n prodctn?
9911 2018-03-21 02:26:09 American oil meme damn funny
9912 2018-03-21 02:26:01 He has several points though...ever since Luxon took over from Fyfe @airnz has become more uncaring about people and more focussed on its profits... even its latest safety video is the equivalent of BP oil filming a safety video in the Gulf of Mexico.

9923 2018-03-21 02:24:35 Most soybeans are used to produce oil used animal feed, but the oil has many other uses, including industrial and in biofuels. An important and useful product. Soybean oil demand grew by 88.5% from 2005 to 2015. When you don't know about something, best not to tweet about it.

9937 2018-03-21 02:23:11 If everyone had solar production capability on on their roofs, we would be so much better off in a short period of time. Tested an electric car. No gas engine, no oil, no transmission, no exhaust system, brake regeneration, carbon fibre. Cost advantages huge for auto ownership.
9938 2018-03-21 02:23:03 The squeaky wheel always gets the oil, but oil often doesn't permanently fix the squeak.  The NRA wasn't sued, the 2A was assaulted.  The NRA filed suit in order to defend it on behalf of its now LARGER membership.  I joined last week.
