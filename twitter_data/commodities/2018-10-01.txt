1 2018-10-01 23:57:14 Ha ha. Yes. Do you understand the term “relative”. The reason people in poor countries don’t have the same commodities as we do isn’t because they cost more for them in real terms. It’s because they cost more for them in relative terms. A gal of oil might cost them a mnths wages
2 2018-10-01 23:55:55 Las commodities (Por ejemplo, petróleo, gas, soja) siempre estuvieron y estarán dolarizadas, Iván. En la gestión previa, mientras el barril de petróleo bajaba a niveles históricos EN DÓLARES, acá aumentaba el combustible fósil porque YPF era deficitaria inexplicablemente.

6 2018-10-01 23:47:56 I think even if just loans weren’t as expensive and if just general commodities for young people were cheaper e.g stationary then it would alleviate a lot of the financial pressure students feel so overwhelmed by.
7 2018-10-01 23:33:36 Seems like the only commodities that Donny could get his head around and understand in the NAFTA agreement were milk, turkeys and windshield wipers. This left most the 1700 page NAFTA agreement intact. Yet he will claim that he saved the world as we know it.
8 2018-10-01 23:33:00 I would expect a move towards the bottom of the wedge

If we see an alignment with the USD beginning to breakout - it does technically fit with pulling commodities lower

DXY forming a base with USOIL moving into a high... should get the majority positioned incorrectly into 2019

10 2018-10-01 23:17:59 Just in 2013, there were only 34,000 people earning minimum wage at $9.75/Hour. 
NDP now celebrating 250,000 people earning minimum wage.  You can’t make this up.  We can now celebrate higher costs of childcare and commodities thanks to the NDP.  Woop woop

12 2018-10-01 23:12:10 Butterscotch may or may not be hot on the commodities market.  I say go for it.
13 2018-10-01 23:12:01 They aren't telling them that, because that isn't true. Whether you do sex work or not, your body is never 'just a commodity'. Stop implying that the bodies of sex workers are commodities, its highly offensive to sex workers.

37 2018-10-01 22:22:54 Tá russo... É exportadora ou commodities, o resto chão
38 2018-10-01 22:10:58 Hi; sustainability takes a lot of work, time and intentionality. It involves breaking down toxic capitalist infrastructure that’s deeply imbedded into how we purchase commodities and build businesses. It’s not a buzzword, trend, or hip new thing to capitalize on.
39 2018-10-01 22:06:43 Raise your hand if you're a solutions sales rep. Sorry to burst your bubble but you're NOT. If you're selling, ERP, HCM, CRM, CMS, etc... they're ALL commodities. Sell the big idea before you say a single word about your silly job title, company size, or your years in business.
40 2018-10-01 22:06:35 These guys aren't commodities. Not how it works unfortunately. Needs + capability gap fillers = offer + accept/reject.
41 2018-10-01 22:02:29 Dunno I was kidding. I think the oil prices depends on the number of traders offering oil trades in the commodities market more than cost or offer theory :D
42 2018-10-01 21:50:36 @awsmvea nagiging commodities tuloy sila samantalang ang daming strays kailangan ng kalinga.
43 2018-10-01 21:27:13 Pino Solanas es definitivamente un imbécil q no sabe un pomo de precios de mercado,  commodities etc.

Verguenza ajena produce su tweet y alto grado de información falsa q la gente burra cree. 

No es el único que es idiota y   representa al pueblo... eso es GRAVE.
44 2018-10-01 21:24:28 Well recall not for a country that does not export our dollar should be a lot weaker. One of the key reasons it isn't is because people see it as a stable currency and trade Commodities through it. One of the first things China did was ti start trading oil futures in Yuan
45 2018-10-01 21:15:29 It's interesting, for so long we have asked for 'a level playing field', yet we are on the cusp of embellishing our standards, and importing the cheapest commodities we can source. It's taking some getting my head around!
46 2018-10-01 21:14:41 Oswaldo: termina de entender que el gobierno de USA no le compra petróleo a ningún país. Para mantener su reserva estratégica de petróleo sí le compra a empresas de USA. Gobierno de EEUU no compra commodities: lo hace la empresa privada registrada en USA. Entiende.
47 2018-10-01 21:10:30 This has been brought up before. The CFTC has been viewing them as commodities since 2015. Still no ETFs so not much has changed.
48 2018-10-01 21:07:48 Por que es un commoditie ignorante! 
La soja tambien esta dolarizada!
El oro, la plata, el gas... tambien sale de la tierra... “son nuestros tambien” pero son commodities!
49 2018-10-01 21:07:28 ¿Por que está dolarizada la soja? Son commodities señor. Deje de generar ignorancia

51 2018-10-01 21:04:22 Porque todo (o casi) lo necesario para ello se produce afuera o son commodities: acero, aluminio, turbinas de gas, turbinas de vapor, componentes de reactores nucleares, tecnología, alternadores, etc. Por ende, repuestos y servicio técnico especializado también de afuera.

54 2018-10-01 20:54:04 The most annoying thing is that, it won’t change the prices which has been increased on commodities
55 2018-10-01 20:49:24 Democrats hate God and treat children like commodities.
56 2018-10-01 20:48:25 Behold, the "logic" of capitalist "efficiency". In Econ 101 textbooks #JunkEconomics nature, animals AND humans are commodities.
57 2018-10-01 20:36:24 And it’s not the same if you beat someone who’s murdering a pig, because sadly society sees it as normal and sees pigs as commodities so you would have everything to lose + the meat and dairy industries are incredibly powerful and would do everything to eliminate any threats
58 2018-10-01 20:33:39 Nenhum país cai de 4% para -3%. Isso só prova o quanto foi frágil e fantasioso o crescimento proporcionado pelo Lula que não se segurou nem mesmo para sua sucessora. Cheio de dinheiro dos commodities e não fez nada por infraestrutura e nem desburocratização do mercado.
59 2018-10-01 20:22:02 No one can change your mind only you can do that, it's between you and your conscience, as an atheist I believe life is short and precious and we don't have the right to treat our fellow animals as commodities and torture them for our own selfish indulgences if we don't have to.
60 2018-10-01 20:15:18 El estado venezolano promoverá e incentivará el uso del petro con el objetivo promover la venta de sus commodities al exterior, la industria, el comercio y la ciudadanía en general. #PetroNuevaEraEconomica
61 2018-10-01 20:12:13 Ordinary citizens incur the biggest losses as always. Soon medical aid won't be paying, people lose on savings, commodities will disappear from shops. In summary 2008 repeat. Tichatambura isu
62 2018-10-01 20:11:18 If historically women have been traded and raped like commodities in war, one should expect their ability to abandon and form new relationships to be more fluid than men as a survival mechanism.

And perhaps even deceive themselves more easily or more often.
63 2018-10-01 20:09:45 Our Naira lost it value globally in which resulted the price of commodities in our local markets tripled. Your failed govt has failed to strength our economy and set a policies that will address the needs to stable our Naira. Naira is the worst performing currency!
64 2018-10-01 20:07:33 What role should industrialized nations play in feeding the world’s growing population - and what food products and commodities should be emphasized in food aid, trade and agricultural production? It's all part of the broader discussion re: The #FutureOfProtein. UofO Oct. 25-26.
65 2018-10-01 20:06:37 #Corn and #soybeans both end higher today for the 1st day of the month. More rain is expected this week throughout the #Midwest making it difficult for #Harvest18.

67 2018-10-01 20:03:42 No you read it correctly.

But it could be that a 9 day delay produced better results than a 5 day delay, for example. And the results could be unique to the underlying index. For example bonds or commodities may exhibit a different relationship.

70 2018-10-01 19:57:47 cash, gold, commodities I believe.  From 71-79 gold rose 20x.  Oil nearly that much.
71 2018-10-01 19:54:59 It’s general... when value of Naira dropped, prices went up so is income that will increase that won’t affect the cost of commodities??
72 2018-10-01 19:53:41 #crudeoil surges as production is increased. Again, we'll likely see the leveraged, financialization of #commodities ramrod a recession.
73 2018-10-01 19:49:39 income affects economic cost of commodities.. so increase in individual income will result to hike in prices of commodities. Just expect cost of transport, shelter, clothing and even food to increase...
74 2018-10-01 19:49:00 i've worked with Argentina for years&on the ground feedback. Brazil developed their own industries (Embraer) and is more diversified. Argentina is stuck w/ commodities&needs cheap currency to attract investors who can use their well-trained workforce for software dev etc

Elogia o governo Dilma ai pra mim?

Lula surfou o boom das commodities e o equilíbrio fiscal que o FHC estabeleceu. Gastou dinheiro sem parar enquanto a economia crescia, mas foi só a marolinha chegar que o castelo de areia dele se desfez.
81 2018-10-01 19:33:43 No, commodities have no  numerical value on their own, the numbers involved are a means of obscuring that the value comes from labor so that the capitalist can benefit from his workers enslavement
82 2018-10-01 19:33:34 Commodities Update:
WTI Crude: +3.15%
Brent Oil: +2.95%
Gold: -0.25%
Silver: -1.27%
83 2018-10-01 19:29:37 Commodity fetishism is also used to mystify workers into thinking that the means of production are not themselves products of labor, and to make them think owners confer value to commodities they produced with the means of production.
84 2018-10-01 19:29:01 A verdade é que esse ano só está batendo o índice quem carregou de commodities e/ou MGLU.
85 2018-10-01 19:28:51 So, can I pay you to calculate the true, labor-measured value of commodities so I can profit from knowing they are over or under priced?
86 2018-10-01 19:26:56 Lol I laughter 
The question is are you guys commodities
87 2018-10-01 19:26:39 That people imagime commodities as having value that wasnt created by labor is commodity fetishism. Commodity fetishism is how we get things like bubbles as market traders inflate the value of goods by creating artificial demand

92 2018-10-01 19:08:47 The monetary policy is largely for pundits to analyse. As for an ordinary citizen like me, I want cash, free access to health and education, buying power for basic commodities and jobs. We have analysed for too long, we need action

98 2018-10-01 18:43:24 Horrendous market action! Very High Risk! Breadth has never recovered even with the first of the month effect. Commodities are rallying, energy sector continues higher, but everything else is weakening. Small caps are selling already. $SPX $DBC $RUT
99 2018-10-01 18:40:28 @ddailyreport  Which inflation is going down. Food inflation is increasing. The prices of rice and beans all jumped  in September.  So did all other prices of basic commodities. Does the President really monitor the basic price index of the economy?

112 2018-10-01 17:57:00 We need to put all of the major internet social media & service providers under Democratic Republican controls so they will be self regulating & not treat users & their content, as commodities.
113 2018-10-01 17:52:42 I'll take it while Gryz and Krug are both out.  But both are proven commodities (Krug more than Gryz, obviously).  Vaakanainen has yet to step on AHL or NHL ice, so while I have high hopes, he may need some time to be NHL ready.
114 2018-10-01 17:46:37 Let's combine the two ideas.  Lets just say, I would not be surprised if I found out Mark Judge offered money for these ladies to do some other videos or events with him. B/c he devalues women as just being  commodities to oggle and acquire.

158 2018-10-01 15:18:44 That's true! Even I haven't encountered common people cribbing about the rising fuel prices. But that maybe because prices of essential commodities are under control. They're bound to increase, if this goes on indefinitely. Govt must keep that in mind...

226 2018-10-01 10:44:32 The problem is that the expectation of investors is for increasing returns over time. Once that stops happening and they look elsewhere (eg., speculating in human intensive harvesting commodities) there is less fuel for Capitalism and is starts to die.
