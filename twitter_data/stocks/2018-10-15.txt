59 2018-10-15 23:37:23 People often express a desire for "low-risk" investments. The thing is, all investment choices have risks. Stocks have a higher risk of going down in a given year. Bonds have a higher risk of not going up in value very much,  requiring investors to work several additional years.
60 2018-10-15 23:37:19 I would generally agree with you, knowing legalization day is the 17th I would not be surprised to see a sell of on that day.  People are obsessed with selling the news, but I think tomorrow is a raging green for pot stocks again.  Wednesday I feel can go either way
61 2018-10-15 23:36:56 Happens all the time mate.
Good thing is that these happen again and again. It stands to reason that if one just caught the high volume momentum trades once a month most people could stop fucking around with pips over a number of stocks non stop. Lol

66 2018-10-15 23:33:14 European stocks were mixed on Monday as concerns over Brexit progress, a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy and higher US borrowing costs limited investor appetite.

70 2018-10-15 23:29:52 US stocks fell in choppy trading on Monday as tech sector weakness prevented stocks from holding on to early gains. Investors also remained cautious following last week’s equity market rout sparked in part by rising US interest rates and lingering worries over corporate earnings.

There is always that risk. At times, the risk can be higher, right?

135 2018-10-15 22:40:02 Oh that's funny. How many layers of expense is there in that formula: auditors, fund managers, brokers, bankers, lawyers? With property there are none of those hangers-on.
If you must do stocks, skip those and get an index fund.

Cheaper to buy than start from scratch! Only the beginning! @SpartanTrading was stellar as always! On Point!

143 2018-10-15 22:31:18 This is All-American #corruption, folks.
Congressmembers/Senators can buy/sell stocks and futures freely, with no regard to the information they glean from their inside govt information.
They write the laws, including the ones that allow them to be so corrupt.

145 2018-10-15 22:31:07 "Large cap active managers' darlings were hit the hardest - the top 50 stocks most overweight by active funds declined 8.9% during the sell-off (MTD, as of Oct 11), lagging the equal-weighted S&P 500 index by 2.4ppt, while the top 50 most underowned stocks were unchanged.” - BAML

In this age of the entitled and bitching gamer do people even enjoy games anymore or is it only about whining about costs and stocks of gaming?
147 2018-10-15 22:29:23 This is crazy, my pot stocks account account today: $8,515.18  $669.05 (+8.53%) It doesn't seem to beslowing down. And this big day is Wednesday, when Canada goes completely legal.
148 2018-10-15 22:28:02 @Long_Money SEC did make reference that they we're watching these type of stocks..
149 2018-10-15 22:27:52 Had to sell non-pot stocks just so I could put more into pot stocks this morning. Wish I had done that sooner... Feeling a bit of FOMO from the last month but I'm still making money so I can't cry!
150 2018-10-15 22:27:51 My new report naming the best companies to double down on during tax loss selling this year will be coming out next week.  This will be similar to my Right Stocks for the Rebound Report, that came out December of 2015.

152 2018-10-15 22:25:33 The primary catalyst for all three stocks appears to be mounting anticipation of the Canadian recreational marijuana market opening on Wednesday, Oct. 17. Canopy, Cronos, and Tilray will be major players in this new market.
153 2018-10-15 22:25:18 Hey dipshit - where the hell do you think the stocks of water blankets etc etc came from - he delegates and people do.  They pre-positioned everything.  That's what leadership is all about - not getting to the site immediately and getting in the way.

159 2018-10-15 22:23:16 market maker says thank you. The nastiest of the nastiest. I have to find the report, but it's something north of 95% of all OTC stocks are bankrupt / delisted within 5 years. Don't have to report shit. Dilute. Dilute. Dilute!

170 2018-10-15 22:13:58 We all know @ScottMorrisonMP has zero morals. Thankfully few are as dumb as Morrison thinks everybody is. @DaveSharma must be wondering what on earth he’s got himself into. 

@drkerrynphelps stocks just keep rising, thanks to Morrison.
171 2018-10-15 22:13:50 Like what? Stocks? Bonds? Real estate? All of those can drop 50+% or are highly illiquid. You're basically arguing that picking up pennies in front of a steamroller is smart long term because it hasn't blown up yet
172 2018-10-15 22:12:17 Excellent start to the week for Watch List stocks with multiple 4 figure profits today - best day in several weeks. Again, patience paying off for those that loaded low during low volume  days > months when the impatient left. Remember for $IJJP $ECOX $AHIX $VMGI $BLLB

187 2018-10-15 22:03:40 U.S. stocks ends session lower in a choppy trading session Monday, dragged down by technology stocks amid lingering worries over interest rates & corporate earnings.
188 2018-10-15 22:02:17 No not stocks lol foreign exchange.. like trading currency. They have classes & it’s worth it honestly compared to what you’re capable of making in the market.
189 2018-10-15 22:01:55 Lol we do play that song for our Sunday Stocks segment but used Mony Mony because they play it in the stadium.
190 2018-10-15 22:01:37 Kudlow said the economy was great, that you should buy stocks, 6 weeks before the market imploded. What a brilliant guy. He doesn’t believe in Climate Change either, which if you agree with him makes you both wrong.
191 2018-10-15 22:01:12 CNBC Markets in Turmoil is the worst. Let the stocks come in some more christ
192 2018-10-15 21:59:42 The difference is that there are consequences for market manipulation in stocks. In crypto there are none. I don’t think the SEC would have to think twice. There’s no structure or regulatory body that oversees exchanges. Don’t bank on an #ETF to get rich.
193 2018-10-15 21:58:54 Cannabis stocks look to become the best investment in the Trump stock market. Coincidence?
194 2018-10-15 21:58:34 Even tho I haven’t sold shit, I made 100$ in stocks so far :)
195 2018-10-15 21:58:24 I’m glad my strategy to recoup my losses was going all in on pot stocks this past week. This must be one of those “I’m smarter than the market moves” that should not have worked but did. So does this mean?

198 2018-10-15 21:56:02 So Cannabis stocks are now a thing and they are outpacing bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500 by as much as 29%.
199 2018-10-15 21:55:37 Can we really say the markets have topped when we have weed stocks that are still going crazy?
200 2018-10-15 21:53:19 US stocks fell o/n as an increase in tensions between Western powers & Saudi Arabia added to worries over rising borrowing costs and the impact of tariffs. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are flat at 5,818. #ausshares #stockmarket
201 2018-10-15 21:52:48 Also a big chunk of the half with stocks are 56 year olds with less than $50,000
in their 401(k).
202 2018-10-15 21:50:15 Yea but those are one offs. It's not index wide like '99. It's hard to fully explain it and perhaps I am too focused on that aspect, but stocks would run from 25 to 145+ in course of 10 days. Just had to be listed. The closest I've seen since was crypto on move from 200B to 800B
203 2018-10-15 21:48:50 Anyone else thing legal weed stocks tank about 1-2 months in if not earlier for an institutional reset buy in and next leg up?
204 2018-10-15 21:48:37 @BigCheds Do you have a recommendation for the best broker/platform for trading stocks?
205 2018-10-15 21:47:55 Doesn't their approach inflate a bubble that will eventually pop? Using tax breaks to buy back stocks to increase their value just pumps that bubble more. People might perceive their 401k investment is growing but it's just smoke and mirrors.

207 2018-10-15 21:46:52 Sorry for her loss. But, the issue is not Bitcoin or those 50 other coins, the issue is low financial IQ

245 2018-10-15 21:22:55 I literally buy and sell stocks for a living. Have for 20+ years. We don’t buy stocks for the cash flows. We buy stocks for the higher future valuations. The dividend yield of equities is always smaller than the earnings and multiple yield.  Basic facts here.

258 2018-10-15 21:17:40 Stocks are just loans with variable interest rates. (Including negative interest every now and then).

Prices are supposed to help reach maximum, worthwhile revenue.
259 2018-10-15 21:17:31 The diffusion theory makes sense. But it fails short on financial literacy. Far easier to learn about stocks than crypto

266 2018-10-15 21:14:14 Sears was the first stick my dad bought for me to explain how stocks worked - he took me to the local store and said you own one brick.  After buying training bras there in the 70s I don’t think I shopped there again til lands end was available.They deserve to die like a dinosaur
267 2018-10-15 21:14:12 In my opinion, price is different of value. In a long run, price follows profit (stocks) and value(Bitcoin, real state, etc)
268 2018-10-15 21:13:11 Yes. Bankrupting anything he can! I say, go after all those who benefited from tax cuts. Real eatate, private prisons, large corporations, republicans who has stocks in companies that benefited from those tax cuts written not by elected representatives, but by lobbyists
269 2018-10-15 21:12:17 Ever notice how when stocks went up in 2009 there was a know it all who was bearish and wrong on the market for 9 years?  Anybody know that guy.
270 2018-10-15 21:11:56 Just putzing about strong stocks here and I doubt I'll participate but $REV sure seems likely to add 30% quickly...
271 2018-10-15 21:10:43 Buying and selling marijuana stocks is in my top 5 things I did to better my life. Started a group for others to excel but it hurts that nobody in my fam jumped on the wave.
272 2018-10-15 21:10:21 lol you recomend many stocks...I'm sure one of them will go up. FYI most stocks that you recommended were down today.
273 2018-10-15 21:09:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
274 2018-10-15 21:09:54 Stocks: <2710.51 SP500 (last week's low) and the Critical Point will offer 2662.00 to 2598.00. The objective will change or negated if today's high is violated at 2775.99. Dead cat bounce over or just resting near the 200d avg? #StockMarket
275 2018-10-15 21:09:25 Stocks: <2710.51 SP500 (last week's low) and the Critical Point will offer 2662.00 to 2598.00. The objective will change or negated if today's high is violated at 2775.99. Dead cat bounce over or just resting near the 200d avg? #StockMarket

278 2018-10-15 21:07:14 Don’t DM me on LinkedIn unless your bathroom stocks Charmin Ultra with fabric texture
279 2018-10-15 21:06:06 Its going to keep going up and down for a few days then settle somewhere around 8.000, there's nothing unusual with the saudi stocks
280 2018-10-15 21:06:02 Remember i am cautioning that Cannabis stocks are overheating into legalization and while i like $CGC and recommended it hard this weekend, it did soar today....
281 2018-10-15 21:05:42 Did you ever notice when stocks start going down, "talking heads" have nothing to talk about anymore and just make nonsense up?
282 2018-10-15 21:05:12 Right, so I guess stocks are just free money to the firms that issue them.
283 2018-10-15 21:03:57 The stocks are greeeeen today 
284 2018-10-15 21:01:49 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-10-15, is 359.2. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
285 2018-10-15 21:01:45 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-10-15, is 260.62. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
286 2018-10-15 21:01:27 The brand is pretty much what sold me on it. What couple meads I've had I've liked but I don't get to try many because they're typically the more expensive drink and most everywhere just stocks the town's local distillery (Necter Creek).
287 2018-10-15 21:00:40 #potstocks

people cashing out Canadian plays?

#reddit full of people saying they finally cashed out after years of holding. These stocks have changed many lives.  mine included.

No telling how high they will climb before they fall.

290 2018-10-15 20:58:18 The Fed (and any reputable accountant) treats stocks as financial assets. You’re doing erroneous accounting. This isn’t even controversial. You’re just factually wrong on this point among others....
291 2018-10-15 20:57:18 $TSLA & $DIS are the only stocks I have holding their value over the last week, Everything else is down ~10%. Just wait till it spikes, gonna be glorious.

294 2018-10-15 20:56:23 I think we first really need to find out what happened and move carefully. Defense stocks have already taken a dive just after first reports,Saudi's mat withhold buying treasury securities and we have 110 billion in arms sales

303 2018-10-15 20:49:58 it is with a heavy heart that i must announce that the pot stocks are at it again
304 2018-10-15 20:49:10 A globally adopted sound money will have far less (basically zero) downside risk relative to stocks or bonds etc.
305 2018-10-15 20:48:49 @dagenmcdowell I think you and @MorningsMaria moved the pot stock market today with your possible Jeff Sessions firing/marijuana legalization discussion this morning.  Some stocks finished up big!
306 2018-10-15 20:48:13 I feel so much better than this morning. I tried this Bang energy drink that my gym stocks and it's actually pretty good. Now I just need to start feeling better about myself. I forget that I've been through major surgeries, but I still feel bad about where I'm at physically rn.
307 2018-10-15 20:48:09 Falling earnings from tech stocks, more tariff tension with China and the U.S., and rising rates during the 4th quarter. I look for another drop of 500 - 1,000 pts.
308 2018-10-15 20:47:48 $VXX calls and $UVXY puts, mj stocks after mid terms, get em now for deep discount and $I
309 2018-10-15 20:47:35 good practice!
310 2018-10-15 20:45:23 $DEWM added another 2.5 million shares today between .0007 and .0008 this stocks gonna rocket higher very soon imo
311 2018-10-15 20:44:19 Listen - that’s a valid concern.  But it’s just not true.  Just background checks, some checks on certain things like bump stocks.  You don’t have to vote for Beto - but voting for Ted isn’t in line with Texas values.
312 2018-10-15 20:43:49 I had earlier heard about @XiaomiIndia fooling customers with its always out of stock products, now I am personally experiencing it.

314 2018-10-15 20:42:08 Stocks fall, led by tech, as Wall Street fails to bounce back from last week's rout

The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fall again on Monday, adding to the steep losses from last week.

316 2018-10-15 20:40:13 “Desirable” <== I can see that.

But “More” Profitable than Stocks in the long run (+10yrs)  I dunno. 

It’s gotta’ be relative. 

House flippers/owners and the like will ALWAYS benchmark their own RoR, especially the “wins.” 

Someone who bought Netflix before the hype- same.
317 2018-10-15 20:37:48 Thought U'v been tellin us to wait til after 17th in expectation of sell off of pot stocks?
318 2018-10-15 20:37:35 when running for president Trump called the stock market a bubble. But now when quite a bit higher, stocks are no longer in a bubble according to Mr T.
319 2018-10-15 20:36:47 One thing of note w/ pot stocks that I haven't seen many mention is that Canada becomes legal tmrw.  Could that be a sell the news event??
320 2018-10-15 20:35:50 GREAT MONDAY. I have heavy eyes from reading so much last night but well worth it. Anyone have a forecast on Cannabis Stocks tomorrow? #WEED #CRON #OGI

322 2018-10-15 20:34:39 Considering Macy’s, Bloomies, Nordstrom still operating, just simply blaming Amazon is the lazy way to cover the Sears collapse. #searsbankruptcy #ausbiz #stocks
323 2018-10-15 20:34:37 Meanwhile financial advisors been steering their clients away from weed stocks last two years while the tsx has been a turd.

327 2018-10-15 20:33:50 Reviewed these and I'm still in $ZTS.  Not in $ORLY or $WING but both look pretty interesting to me.  Other stocks to keep your eye on $EQNR, $HAE, $JKHY and $TJX
328 2018-10-15 20:33:45 With October 17th being the day after tomorrow I guess this push in MJ stocks would be expected. The game is rarely that easy though. Probably a nasty "sell the news" coming to take some air out of the balloon.
329 2018-10-15 20:33:25 What's most interesting (Again),  and very negative for stocks in the future --  about the late day fade in the market:  
No strong bid in bonds.  
Bonds are acting like they are going lower.
330 2018-10-15 20:32:07 Not a great close for $SPY also drifting down after hours also. Doesn't seem to be stalling the $MJ stocks $CRON $TLRY etc..
331 2018-10-15 20:31:19 Plus MAGA with their mantra,”Look at the economy.” When none have significantly benefitted from it.  Even with the tax scam, how much more money are they shopping with?  How much have their stocks risen when maybe 2% can afford to play investments w/out company 401K?

335 2018-10-15 20:28:53 $NBEV is such an easy swing stock, Up 18% today (Gamble plays only on volatile stocks like this). $NFLX earnings tomorrow. $TWTR up 5.15% in two days, also forming falling wedge pattern.
336 2018-10-15 20:28:22 $OXY, $NVDA, $ADBE, $VLO, and $NUE were the top five stocks that closed lower today.

340 2018-10-15 20:27:32 $LLC, $HRS, $RL, $HII, and $EQT were the top five stocks that closed higher today.

349 2018-10-15 20:24:12 Obviously would depend a lot on the Indian markets, but I would be shooting for a number of percentage points over risk free rate in India.  If stocks there are thriving you might do more for a while, then you would have to deal with some down periods to average it out.
350 2018-10-15 20:23:37 alot of people FOMO'ing now as some stocks sky rocket. they may also be the people complaining down the road that they are bag holding at the All Time High...

375 2018-10-15 20:10:54 Another end of day sell-off (not a good omen for stocks). Techs stocks continue to lead the decline (Nasdaq down 66 points - almost 1%). The market's lead sled dog - Apple - closed on the low of the day. And the VIX (fear gauge) actually fell slightly (no capitulation today).

377 2018-10-15 20:10:24 The national debt went up . We don’t collect enough money from corporations to pay our bills.  They get to keep more to buy back stocks and give extra bonus to the board and the tax cuts didnt trickle down .

379 2018-10-15 20:09:49 World stocks mostly lower: US -.6%; Europe +.1%. With all the uncertainty and likely coming interest-rate increases, investors saw little reason to buy. Yet, 3Q earnings will likely "ride to the rescue" up 20+%. It's 2019 earnings-growth that could give investors' pause & pain.

385 2018-10-15 20:08:21 Blue chips and techs struggle for most of the day and slide into the close. Dow ends -89, -0.4% to 25,250. 

Nasdaq -0.8%, S&P 500 -0.6%.

But smaller stocks take the lead. Russell 2000 and S&P midcap both +0.7%.

Bond yields steady.

389 2018-10-15 20:06:33 There's not many good looking stocks left, we'll all be in the same ones! I played CGC earlier in the year without success and missed the second move. I could justify taking MJ ETF on a breakout, avoiding individual co. risk, but not in any hurry there. Will see what happens.
390 2018-10-15 20:06:07 The magic of indexes. Since the S&P 500 set its last closing high on Sept 20th, 7 stocks are down more than 20% (usual bear market definition).

BUT: 147 S&P stocks are down more than 20% from their highs of the past year.

392 2018-10-15 20:05:58 No need for bond ETFs if you invest in good stock ETFs & sell the stock ETFs if you need cash. Bonds especially treasuries not safer than stocks as they were once when the USG behaved like a responsible borrower. Stock ETFs return more than bond ETFs if you carefully check.

396 2018-10-15 20:05:34 The lowest priced of our stocks under $10, AVEO also has the highest potential upside by percentage. The stock’s current price is $2.74 per share with an average target $5.50 — or a 100% gain.
397 2018-10-15 20:05:18 It looks like people getting sick of SP putting their hopes in weed stocks, inflating the bubble even more. Wonderful. Its a game of hot patato, dont end up like cryptonerds people.
398 2018-10-15 20:04:54 I did this going into the 2008 crash.  I still lost about 20% of the value but my co-workers who stayed in stocks lost 35-40%.  Also, I haven't had to lose sleep watching the market.  Granted, I am nearing retirement and don't have time to ride the roller-coaster.

You're not into some pot stocks?
402 2018-10-15 20:03:21 On the flipside, however, stocks under $10 offer plenty of room for growth, and a small gain in price can translate into a huge percentage gain.
403 2018-10-15 20:02:47 It’s tempting to avoid low-priced stocks. The absolute numbers never seem impressive, and there is a tendency to see low prices as indicators of low quality. But that’s how I got my start in investing years ago even before I had my finance degree

406 2018-10-15 20:02:09 Nothing, because based on a 100% allocation to stocks and the medium drop of 7.8% from the SPY peak, you likely have over $1mm in that account and look well young enough to know what the real LT value of that is...If anything buy & rebalance more in.

470 2018-10-15 19:39:34 don't disagree about the short term nature of this. but the challenge for $tgod is that pot stocks are a momentum driven market, having a strategic investor exit stage right is never a good look. to your point its a long term play here, its a show me stock - execute, execute

493 2018-10-15 19:26:35 The chances of their stocks collapsing is much higher than the CCP itself collapsing, unfortunately, so try not to get your hopes up too much.

514 2018-10-15 19:17:08 As Ive been saying for months, I think stocks have a "sell the news" reaction to the "good news" of repubs holding congress . Mania tops often happen on good news.

563 2018-10-15 18:58:37 The bigger issue remains is the Top5 stocks account for almost 50% of JSE index. Thus most funds almost 'forced' to purchase these counters. More needs to be done on benchmark education & perhaps regulatory limits on exposure.

By Jeffrey Kleintop Schwab
Market volatility has made investors wonder if the economic cycle is ending and stocks are starting a prolonged decline. One indicator, the gap between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, suggests the risks are rising.

648 2018-10-15 18:14:55 You mean right after the IPO? Or just in general , like when would you think , is a good time to purchase your own company stocks (thank you btw)
649 2018-10-15 18:14:47 For profit incarceration. Just look up the politicians who are for privatizing prisons, who donates to them and what stocks they invest in. They make more $ being politicians than whatever their profession was before running for their seats.
650 2018-10-15 18:13:55 He uses all the products of companies he invests in.  And he's big into marijuana stocks.  So I assume he doesn't call himself an analyst most of the time.  Probably calls himself a space cowboy. which is why he loves elon so much.

Near end session, I’m running a screener to pull which stocks have new green candlesticks for that day and am tracking how many of those are up half a percent the next session. I’m seeing avg of 90% up the next day.

658 2018-10-15 18:11:07 Of course, but the original tweet discusses people watching their stocks, bonds & retirement accounts lose value, which implies the populations of developed capitalist nations, not Venezuela.
659 2018-10-15 18:10:47 Amazon, with billions and billions you make off Americans, why not share your wealth with as a start your own employers? Why did you take away their stocks and bonuses just because you raised their minimum wages? You support socialism, start practicing within your own company

662 2018-10-15 18:10:04 Breadth may be good, but led by defensive sectors (util, staples, real estate, telco) while top 10 stocks are for sale... mirror image of Friday. Just bleeding off the epic oversold in Russell with inside days (read: distribution).

671 2018-10-15 18:05:17 Interest rate hike and over all trend suggest this downfall in stocks. FDI inflow will be key factor to gauge performance in this tenure.
672 2018-10-15 18:04:55 It is incredible how many mom and pop are interested in pot stocks and cryptos. 100% chance these go nowhere anytime soon.
673 2018-10-15 18:04:54 The market breadth (gainers/losers) of 0.94x for the day indicates that the number of sellers outpaced the number of buyers in the market today. At the end of the day's trading, 16 stocks advanced as 17 stocks declines;
674 2018-10-15 18:04:01 yep and that profit taking will push to the ##%, retail investors will panic sell into the $12-$13 zone. sadly i don’t see ut holding. Legalization is the only thing keep weed stocks up currently. Stock market is BEAR and were heading into a crash.. worse ever imo
675 2018-10-15 18:03:41 And -- trust me on this -- markets are THIN -  Unless one is confining themselves to the big ETF's.  I trade individual stocks,  and it takes time to turn around.

681 2018-10-15 18:00:26 I was in this room for a week to know this guy is a fraud. First he give you levels, and says no jumping in or chasing the open, then he say hes up 40% 3 mins in to the day on completely different stocks.

685 2018-10-15 17:57:38 @BadaBingCapital I agree but even the best, high quality, growth stocks in my universe regularly correct 20-30% after big run ups...
686 2018-10-15 17:56:54 I love your work @MebFaber, but this rhetoric is the problem. Naysayers act like crypto events are unique (they're not); stubborn believers won't accept any negativity. Reality is there are good & bad aspects of crypto, & there are good & bad elements of ETFs, stocks, bonds, etc.
687 2018-10-15 17:56:50 Sometimes I really be forgetting work standards vs. home standards. I forget I can't walk around with my Redbull and ignore everyone while putting up stocks lmao

695 2018-10-15 17:51:29 I'm really losing my love for FI Twitter, Its the same group going around trying to influence others by attacking those that put forward suggestions from the penny stocks. Its shameless and calculated and I wouldn't be surprised if it puts people off the product.
696 2018-10-15 17:50:42 Since October technology stocks have fallen more than  6%. They were the best performance among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors last year.

699 2018-10-15 17:49:58 Me neither. It’s low float for sure but nothing backing up this little run here. Nice but gotta be cautious.
700 2018-10-15 17:49:04 In that sense you expect stocks going up instead of down...of course market correction will happen anyways. Just not sure why many serious investors think Pot stocks will crash on that day...

731 2018-10-15 17:38:47 I'd presume everyone panics and stocks up as there'll be little producers, and so people scavenge. I guess it depends on how long it's been on that realism factor.

736 2018-10-15 17:37:02 @TomSteyer and other millionaires should join forces and purchase HUGE stakes in Fox stocks, or buy them right out, so they can clean house. Hey rid of ALL the propaganda pushers because if Fox News no longer is an avenue for his trash, then we can begin to heal this nation.

743 2018-10-15 17:34:41 Market will get support at 35,500 points and the buyers/investors will come to market for a short period of time. When they will sell their low level purchased stocks, market will collapse.

747 2018-10-15 17:33:42 Of course it feels good to have most of my stocks green, but I'm actually impressed with how indifferent I *feel* today. The only way I can limit downside emotion on red days is if I learn to also limit upside excitement on green days. Happy I'm not too happy!

753 2018-10-15 17:31:42 U.S. stocks fell on Monday, coming off their worst five-day drop in seven months last week, as Apple led technology stocks lower and tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to already frayed investor nerves ahead of earnings.

762 2018-10-15 17:28:53 Perhaps a more likely reason: trailing volatility has been very low, so a medium-sized dip in stocks appears to cause a large spike in volatility.

772 2018-10-15 17:21:12 That doesn’t mean that most of the people around me would fight stricter gun laws Bump stocks need to go and I believe that most semi automatic weapons should only be available to rent at an authorized firing range SemiAutomatic pistols I  should be legal for home protection
773 2018-10-15 17:20:01 So apparently when you set a watch list alert, it is only emailed. You can set text alerts for stocks individually, but not for your watch list, which makes it kind of pointless.

792 2018-10-15 17:09:12 2/In stagflationary 1970s, some ppl made lots of money on gold-mining stocks. Some ppl made fortunes owning stocks w/"gold" in name, weren't actually gold-related . Something like 50x appreciation.

Might yet but didn't happen so far this time around.
793 2018-10-15 17:08:57 I’ve never invested in stocks before besides buying stock from my employer. So this is somewhat new to me.
794 2018-10-15 17:08:41 Anything is possible. Look at $TLRY for example. But many MJ stocks will see record growth in the next 12 months. MANY!!! And $TGODF will be oneof the major players IMO. Either way I'm in and we shall see.

828 2018-10-15 16:57:32 Tax holes? There is little tax on stocks where a large percent of their wealth comes from. And the middle class makes up most of the populations so of course we would be taxed. Labor is taxed but profile(stocks) is taxed very little and passive income isn’t taxed at all
829 2018-10-15 16:57:31 That believing credit erosion will be a clear and early warning of what happens to stocks could be a matter of fighting the last war. Not saying I believe it, but wondering.

836 2018-10-15 16:55:19 So it can be a useful measure for a dip buy  On strong stocks using the Fibonacci level as a stop loss if it can’t be held. But that will vary depending on your style and risk tolerance

838 2018-10-15 16:54:07 It can be a sign of strength Relative to the Fibonacci level. If we are in a strong up trend and get a pullback you probably don’t get a pull all the way to the Fibonacci level on leading stocks

852 2018-10-15 16:46:08 Yep I see the point but looking at traditional investing (shares & funds etc) it’s not all about income, you can invest in plenty of things purely for capital growth like AIM stocks and emerging markets. The young players are effectively our emerging markets.

895 2018-10-15 16:27:36 "I DID, Tony. So did many of your employees, whose lives were destroyed when you shut down the weapons division. Our highest grossing department. The most our investors held stocks in!"
896 2018-10-15 16:27:30 @heidi_chung Let's talk about marijuana stocks over drinks?
897 2018-10-15 16:27:28 paying the  state  handsomely each  day  evan if  there not guilty and the  fact  that  the  those insurance stocks  or  from  china and over seas means what  were  slaves  free   your  people of false imprisonments and  double check those  bank account I see  that's  slavery
898 2018-10-15 16:26:39 Record employment, record stocks, record wages, better trade, a pacified NK, many hostages returned, pro-constitution judges.  Jobs not Mobs.  Pro-America, Pro-Flag, Pro-Citizens, Pro-Secure borders.
899 2018-10-15 16:26:19 I’ll give 5 stocks for $50 deal ?
900 2018-10-15 16:25:42 Just imagine what would happen to these #Canadian #Marijuana, #Pot stocks If and when #Coke, #Altria, etc bought a stake in any of the usual's.  $CRON, $NBEV, $PYX, $TLRY, etc.   The move in group would be insane.
901 2018-10-15 16:25:41 You mean the NRA? The same organization that funneled money from Russia? The same organization that thinks bump stocks are perfectly fine? The same organization that thinks taking guns into bars is acceptable? That organization?

904 2018-10-15 16:23:59 Save America? From what? Jobs, strong economy, 2A rights, reduced burdensome regulations on businesses, religious freedom, 1A rights, immigration laws being enforced, consumer index high, stocks higher overall, tax cuts, etc? America needs to be saved from these and what else?
905 2018-10-15 16:23:52 @jimcramer I think the problem with tech stocks is that many investors don’t understand the core technologies, so that listen to analysts who also don’t understand the core technologies.
906 2018-10-15 16:23:37 Try looking up you tube videos of options. It would much to hard to type it out. But you risk less and you gamble the direction the stock will go. If it goes that direction you make $100's instead of $ small dollar amounts of owning stocks. Ex: if I say tesla will be at 275$ fri

932 2018-10-15 16:15:22 And those things are excellent! I’m referring to gun control legislation on the national level. Bump stocks are the only thing that have been regulated. But great news in Florida! Hopefully, the rest of the country will follow suit.
933 2018-10-15 16:15:15 I'm not saying that a crash is going to happen in U.S. Stocks, but we are absolutely in an environment where one is entirely possible. I'm not one of these guys who goes around scaring people, but I don't think the real risk is currently being respected by most investors

937 2018-10-15 16:14:27 Why?
938 2018-10-15 16:13:50 not the good time for investment in auto stocks this sector is in bear phase, for trading it is OK
939 2018-10-15 16:13:49 When as single parent after working a 40 hour week on min wage they are still £70 below the poverty line, with UC top up, perhaps they could adapt Rees Mogg’s advice for surviving an initial hard Brexit and use their savings, investments, stocks and shares to top up !
940 2018-10-15 16:13:36 Just six stocks accounting for a strong portion of the gains of 2018 in the US Markets. The president doesn't grasp the basics of international trade, and the harm his policies has caused on the world economy.
941 2018-10-15 16:13:35 Never had funny experience. Either it was sad or happy. Now I dont feel any emotion. Maybe now its better :) but when I knew nothing about stocks I used to think how can one sell without buying and why is it called short? I can always take long position on a short :-D
942 2018-10-15 16:13:18 It is quite obvious that AU SFB aint a good buy.  90% of stocks aren't. The praise is in identifying what is a good buy.

946 2018-10-15 16:12:37 "Our stock market is booming" -- hmm, stocks are flat this year according to most indices. So, that's a bit of a stretch.
947 2018-10-15 16:12:36 Wonder when was the last time there were more stocks under their 200 DMA?
948 2018-10-15 16:12:15 Rick Scott, signed into law, raising the age to buy a gun, banned bump stocks, allow law enforcement W/ a judge approval to deem mental illness from owing a gun for up to one year.  So are you still saying that?

962 2018-10-15 16:09:35 "F" is good. You, and the NRA do not want to ban bump stocks, or AR15 type weapons, and do not want to increase the age to 21 in order to buy a weapon. 
NRA is a Russian backed lobbying firm who acted as the US based company to contribute millions of Russian $ to Trump's campaign
963 2018-10-15 16:09:12 Yeah. At one time they were the only place we could get Follow Your Heart cheese. Our daughter would bring us up a supply from the Islington store.

1004 2018-10-15 15:53:14 Investor can invest in etf only through trading and demat account. It is bought or sold just like stocks. It is subjective to volatality throughout market hours.

1005 2018-10-15 15:52:59 Well, they may be getting some help from the Federal Reserve Bank which is surreptitiously removing the punch bowl from the stock market. This will sink stocks and cause the Republicans to lose the Mid-Term elections.

1013 2018-10-15 15:50:41 Some Mega cap tech and momentum tech stocks still seems a little pricey. A further 5-10% down correction may help if that would rotate into the many good values in the market.

1139 2018-10-15 14:58:30 Some of the best investment opportunities are companies that don't screen very well. Their stocks remain untouched and unloved while the qualitative factors boil below the surface of the financials. Dig below the surface. Find them before others. This is the art of investing-GC

1144 2018-10-15 14:55:57 Imho, yes in the very ST. Crashes are deflationary by nature and Gold will likely fall too but at a relatively slower pace than everything else. That is, until expectations for a #Fed policy reversal grow which I expect once we're 20% down in stocks. Then #Gold will bottom imho.

1168 2018-10-15 14:47:16 Interesting Facts About The Stock Market

Stocks go up an average of 1.5% during earning season

October is the best/worst month of the year(when it's bad, it's real bad)

October, November, December are the three strongest consecutive months of the year.
1169 2018-10-15 14:47:09 We shouldn’t have gone totally understood was: FREEDOM is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As we are
1170 2018-10-15 14:46:27 Anuj. But because it is not “ out of the woods “ is exactly the reason for buying some. Stocks when out of the woods also come at good prices.
1171 2018-10-15 14:45:42 Why do you think Goldman Sachs is downgrading everything? So they can pick up stocks. Called manipulating the stock market for there own well being
1172 2018-10-15 14:44:49 Tech stocks getting hit today. Nasdaq down nearly 1%. But it's fairly quiet for the rest of the market. Dow and S&P 500 flattish. Hoping I'm not jinxing it but it would be nice to have a day or two where volatility takes a nap.
1173 2018-10-15 14:44:39 Break 111.50 and it’s over for stocks IMO

1177 2018-10-15 14:43:42 Day's Gain $3,259.28
Earlier a friend texted me he was taken out of his stocks with a 5% stop loss. Sure, he lost some, but he lost some of this one day gain also. Panic is the silent emotional enemy of profits. How do I know? I’ve made hasty moves. When I got in it cost $$$

Then stocks goes back up to $105, however your call is now worth $45. So, stock price higher than when u purchased, but your call lower

1277 2018-10-15 14:10:35 $tgod is not in a good position. Get out while you still can.  Stock can go to lower then IPO price. Company does not produce any revenue.

1319 2018-10-15 13:58:14 It would be a huge gamble and one I personally would not do right now despite me frequently buying shares "on the fall" and depresses stocks for the turnaround. One problem is the dilution - significant at that price - meaning PER looks hot at a lower sp (for the same mcap).
1320 2018-10-15 13:58:11 No, just anti ar15.

1321 2018-10-15 13:57:40 Yeah, it’s a Wall Street world, at least according to the pundits, so why not make candidates into stocks? Since that’s how most of their donors make their money, maybe not a metaphor...

1323 2018-10-15 13:56:48 Sadly, the euphoria regarding the initial parabolic moves in jr. stocks usually don't live up to market, speculative, extrapolative valuations going out maybe months in some cases based upon binary news and/or as Qs come in.  Still doesnt mean you cant speculate or invest for $$.
1324 2018-10-15 13:56:37 $ACB and most pot stocks across the board are smoking this morning.

1329 2018-10-15 13:56:04 Think about it this way -  the nifty fifty stocks that led the market in the 1960's, were not the best stocks to own when the market finally recovered in the 1980's - better value and growth stocks led.

Think about what happened to Digital Equipment, Compaq - 80's leaders - GONE

1402 2018-10-15 13:31:53 In what regard? I mean markets see the big drone in Chiense stocks, which is bad. But a collapsing housing market is far worse IMO. 90% of Chinese are homeowners.

1404 2018-10-15 13:30:20 Been the problem. Many focus on stocks, which is bad.  But the average Chinese don't have a stock 401k. They may have a home and 1-2 investment properties.

1413 2018-10-15 13:26:45 Just a heads up -- yes, some stocks are resilient here but (a) we're just two weeks off the top and (b) the few good-looking names are relatively obvious to the crowd. That's why breakouts or strength usually fail during market downtrends and turbulent times.

1515 2018-10-15 12:42:17 You’ve just articulated a particular problem there. The lion’s share of pensions should come from infrastructure investment. Stocks and shares, particularly with the instabilities introduced by financialised capital, are no proper home for the nation’s pensions.

1750 2018-10-15 10:04:42 I do agree most people don’t understand how stocks n shares or financial products generally work. I understand why FTSE is inversely related to movements in the £. Most people don’t.
1751 2018-10-15 10:02:48 Don't talk to me because you will not change your portfolio! Instead talk to Blackrock's  research team so they will be able to guide you to choose better stocks!!
1752 2018-10-15 10:02:37 commodities are always cyclical and they boom near end of cycle. The cycle has been strong - lead by tech stocks, so it is time for the miners. Look at the historical $RIO well below highs before this market boom.
1753 2018-10-15 10:00:09 Just mentioning the spd has no relevance of your / government strategy coz the majority of stores are outdated looks and stuff inside.  The customers has no option to buy the stocks available @ Khadi and so understand the ground realities for improvisation rather airy claims.
1754 2018-10-15 09:59:15 I DO NOT understand why the US govt is making such a big deal over a journalist who was somewhere he probably shouldn't have been... 

Who gives a F**K?!

1757 2018-10-15 09:53:04 Everything regarding money affects the wealthy disproportionately being they have more of it. That doesn’t make it inherently bad.

I’m not speaking to the volatility of indiv: stocks. Anyone whose 401k is invested in any mutual fund, most of which are, benefit from buybacks.

1761 2018-10-15 09:48:41 No - everyone who owns shares will lose. If boses don’t hit performance goals they don’t get given shares as rewards; if the share price goes down they lose money and lose capital with which to grow the business. This is a stupid headline made by someone with no concept of stocks

2119 2018-10-15 04:11:13 I just leave Apt alone now... as a beginner I have now switched my focus to slower moving stocks with a good catalyst and it’s really help my risk reward.
2120 2018-10-15 04:11:04 Will check it out. Ala kmi at $14, sometimes long dead stocks that have cleaned house can be cheap because of disbelief, fatigue and emotion. Q: is weak generic pricing still a headwind or has that bottomed?

2132 2018-10-15 04:04:22 Can you speak without being a condescending jackas?

Yea buybacks improve stocks but those are still volatile and while a good investment, not the best. 

In the end it's disproportionately benefiting the rich and that is undeniable 'B'
2133 2018-10-15 04:03:53 How fondly I’ll remember 2014, when I thought it would be neat to learn how to can my own stocks.

2138 2018-10-15 04:00:13 not a good sign for stocks to start the week. Asia already in sell mode. US traders will probably panic if the slide continues this week.
2139 2018-10-15 03:59:48 Today feels different, early last week, most of my stuff deep was in the red too, today, most of it is holding up, but the hype stocks are back going down.  Not the same day at all, doesn't feel indiscriminate.

2147 2018-10-15 03:51:49 The stock market isn’t the economy. But you do you bro. I hope you shorted some stocks.
2148 2018-10-15 03:51:29 Life can be like investing in the stock market. When the stocks go  it’s great, and when they are  it sucks. They have good and bad days/weeks/months. If you monitor every fluctuation you’ll go crazy. Invest in it long term. It may take time, but the payoff will be worth it.
2149 2018-10-15 03:50:25 It's the 21st century snake oil. If it had so many "healing" capabilities, one of the big pharmaceutical companies would have tapped it long ago. I have seen so many pot stocks pop up claiming this or that only to prove to be a pump n dump... snake oil!

2173 2018-10-15 03:34:33 There are about 10-15 stocks which are keeping afloat the illusion of resilience. The larger universe of stocks has taken a hammering.
2174 2018-10-15 03:33:24 Would be a good call if the independent stautuory officer could also take into consideration all issues affecting welfare, such as grain stocks tightening, drought and el nino.

2197 2018-10-15 03:13:22 Your tax breaks caused this Dildo Braggins. Companies took your cash grab and did stock buybacks. Investors lost faith in the true value of their stocks which leads to a crash.
2198 2018-10-15 03:12:38 According to Deutsche Bank,  the rise in #housing prices in #China has risen more than 24 trillion RMB in 37 tier 1/2 cities, more than twice disposable income.

One of the reasons why more focus should be on home prices and not Chinese stocks. 90% of Chinese are home owners.

2201 2018-10-15 03:10:21 I’ve picked many great stocks in my lifetime of investing: the first big one was Microsoft in 1986 after its IPO.  Since then, I’ve always looked for big game-changers to find big winners and Tesla is a bit more complicated but so far it is still a 10-bagger in 5 years so far.

2204 2018-10-15 03:09:53 Buybacks disproportionately benefit the rich. That's because the top 10% of households owned 84% of all stocks in  2016, according to research from NYU professor Edward Wolff.

2220 2018-10-15 02:51:13 Considering all the headwinds and where we are in the general economic cycle and valuations, I think we will test February lows before end of 2018. Cannabis stocks may continue to stand out though. Action in nvda and some other names reminds of me 2000.

2246 2018-10-15 02:31:39 Yes, there is a fair amount of order switching (Taiwan and the EU both buying more US beans as China buys out Brazil stocks) but for ND growers, the only real market was China because they shipped those beans to the PNW
2247 2018-10-15 02:31:38 Yep I’m sorry I got in your gutter. And even got baited to going low. So congratulations on your success tonight.

2250 2018-10-15 02:30:30 In Smash 4 stocks generally can get exploded by the good characters.

Smash 4 is more similar to melee, but without extensive movement options
2251 2018-10-15 02:29:36 Canadian analysts on the week of full legalization in $CAD are suggesting that investors/traders should sell the top five leading $MJ stocks they own because they're all overvalued. Let the noise begin. #wallstgame
2252 2018-10-15 02:26:01 Quick tip for young people struggling with this: do not save money just to save it in a savings accounts, freaking invest it. 10k in a savings account will still be 10k in 5 years, or even less due to inflation. Instead buy stocks, invest in something, don’t just park your money.

2283 2018-10-15 02:05:12 bump stocks aren’t a problem. They’re just the left’s favorite non-issue.

I wouldn’t mind if they were banned, but it’s more trouble to ban them than it’s worth. A belt loop can do the same thing as a bump stock. So unless we’re banning belt loops now, it doesn’t matter

2292 2018-10-15 01:56:36 Democrats would at least consider implementing reasonable gun regulations like banning bump stocks which was something so basically simple and obvious that I thought even a GOP controlled Government could do. But they couldn’t even do that. And that is why they FAIL on this issue
2293 2018-10-15 01:56:22 Will this week's earnings distract from the yield and Chinese trade worries this week or will it exacerbate them? Could go either way. I'm watching to see if the big caps warn on their conference calls about rising costs. #stocks #investing

2297 2018-10-15 01:52:09 No.  Have you read anything about this?  Strong regulations on background checks etc and banning bump stocks isn't a problem for the "average" American.  As well as these semi automatic rifles in question.  The regulations against them were eased in the eighties I believe.

2302 2018-10-15 01:48:28 Yeah, but unsure of how to proceed. Nowhere would be safe if the economy collapses. Hoping crypto provides a safe haven in the case that a bailout is required. Got a little exposure to gold, but mostly just shorting stocks and buying crypto

2313 2018-10-15 01:42:01 Friday night saw tech stocks lead Wall St higher, following a quietened end to Asian markets. Whilst the S&P500 came out of its losing streak, the ASX futures closed lower and are down this morning. US bond yields were higher, 10yrs trading at 3.167%.
2314 2018-10-15 01:41:48 Agree all tech stocks are broken except that. Amazing that index is down only 10 percent given the carnage
2315 2018-10-15 01:41:26 Listening to @mikiebarb’s The Daily about how Trump got rich (with @susannecraig) and it’s crazy to hear that Fred Trump brought Time Inc. stocks, Donald Trump says he wants to buy Time Inc, pushing the stock price up. And then Fred Trump sells and makes 40,000... just wow

2318 2018-10-15 01:39:08 You might try adding some cutoffs/scraps (bits of meat, fat, sinew). Those bones looked very clean, generally the best stocks I've made have included a healthy amount of scrap & I'm not sure marrow has much fat content.
2319 2018-10-15 01:38:14 Was considering this myself for long term account. Many of these stocks have seen gains of hundreds of percent so I think they likely further to fall. No right answer though.

2322 2018-10-15 01:37:19 How many shares did you buy? and secondly, at what price? I have watching this kind of stock and stocks for a while myself. very interesting to see how all of this comes out. Very interest in other weed stocks. But, won't buy until they hit $15.00 a share.
2323 2018-10-15 01:36:14 Bump stocks are rarely used in shootings, and waiting periods are ineffective, again the killer will find other means. You worked yourself into a circle, the AI isn’t strong here.
2324 2018-10-15 01:34:04 For me to fully profit (I usually manage trade at 50 percent) the stocks has to stay between 300 and 380. 

Let's say it goes below 300. I can roll down my 380 for an addition profit. 

That will lower my cost basis and reestablish my probabilities I initially established

2335 2018-10-15 01:24:52 Thanks for this. Stocks are interesting to look at due to the availability of data to backtest.  Also think this applies to something as levered and illiquid as Real Estate.  I try to get clients to focus less on price & more on  # of transactions and timelines.
2336 2018-10-15 01:24:47 Really?  Stocks are up 23%. That's good. Under Obama this far in his Admin it was 38 %.

2352 2018-10-15 01:10:54 So someone is mad that they lost money in stocks and now they’re looking to get a settlement out of Elon, ‘cause he’d probably rather throw 10k at someone than spend a day in court. That’s not indicative of anything special. That’s just people being opportunistic.

2356 2018-10-15 01:07:02 Why even THINK its true? Didnt EXOLs complain they couldnt buy becoz  stocks ran out at stores & SM underproduce? SUDDENLY an idiot plays with our mind & it sways lol. kbuzz is just a ROT RAT
2357 2018-10-15 01:06:09 Given, only info is: stock-market selloff: keeping the same percentage of cash, before & after the selloff could be wise.  So, if arbitrarily: there was 50% cash, 50% stocks, easy math, and stock market fell 10%, it could be good to take (2.5/95)%, and buy dip, just to rebalance.
2358 2018-10-15 01:05:48 Not really. People who invest in stocks (should) know that nothing is guaranteed, and they may very well lose it all. It’s a gamble; if they lose, that’s on them.

Like, I can’t stand Trump. His policies are causing my own stocks to dive. But that’s just the game.

2362 2018-10-15 01:00:12 Ban bump stocks.  Mandatory waiting periods.  That would stop impulsive killing.  Maybe limits on semi-automatics.
2363 2018-10-15 01:00:04 And if its no the PPT the IMF or BIS calls on Swiss national bank or Japan central bank to buy stocks directly.  Giant coordination by central banks to  manipulate all markets.

2372 2018-10-15 00:50:11 So again I'll ask do u really think bump stocks and things like that don't exist? 
2373 2018-10-15 00:49:37 I dont why people got mixed up with revenue and market capitalisation. YG's revenue last year is at $300M and the next is JYP at $95M.
YG's market value in the stocks dropped and that's it.

2375 2018-10-15 00:48:27 Check out the movement in the last year for contact center software stocks.
2376 2018-10-15 00:47:53 I wish I was that guy that was always like one step ahead of everything. Like always have the newest tech and know what kind of stocks to buy and stuff. Tell me someone else knows what I mean.
2377 2018-10-15 00:47:45 Are you watching contact center software stocks? Almost all have been massively pumped this year.
2378 2018-10-15 00:47:15 Can you tell me about your country stocks are they high or low price . I think every where it is low price?
2379 2018-10-15 00:46:33 You should stop trading Canadian energy stocks until we change governments. Fact.
2380 2018-10-15 00:46:23 I just watch the food network, the news and stocks
2381 2018-10-15 00:45:33 Really Matt?  While true coming from money mks life sometimes easier I’ve seen several just blow thru inheritance. Get a good portfolio for passive income. And reinvest. Work hard spend less. I started with nothing,teachers salary,but you strt buying stocks andit over 
2382 2018-10-15 00:44:16 Nothing is inherently wrong with short selling, which is permissible under the regulations of the SEC.However, the short-and-distort type of short seller uses misinformation and a bear market to manipulate stocks. S&D is illegal, as is its counterpart, the pump and dump.

2386 2018-10-15 00:40:06 Acheté sur Amazon mais il est plus dispo pour l’instant. Tu devrais le trouver sur d’autres sites. Les caps sont PBT donc faudra prendre un set ABS sur Bangood pour remplacer les stocks.
2387 2018-10-15 00:39:22 I'm usual chill calm and collected but this man makes me wanna throw all my thunder bolt stocks at him.
2388 2018-10-15 00:38:35 Saudis reject threats as stocks plunge after GZA comments
2389 2018-10-15 00:35:46 There was much more, like the tech stocks. There is usually an October correction.
2390 2018-10-15 00:33:50 On a Sunday? He can't golf?He's done  more than most presidents. Don't like ur 401k, jobs,bonuses,stocks? Stop whining.
2391 2018-10-15 00:32:04 What’s it mean for stocks.
2392 2018-10-15 00:31:39 See Mars/Ketu in Saturn sign while Saturn quite vulnerable in Dhanu (like debilitated) has huge effects on markets. There is already bloodbath in stocks and reality may further see in tight spot for another year. This itself is worse than a war. Isn't it?

2394 2018-10-15 00:26:10 I suggest they should buy airline stocks.
2395 2018-10-15 00:25:12 Lol nah. It's a little two bedroom apartment. Theres only two of them though. My grandfather built them after he lost all of his retirement (stocks crashed and the dude monitoring his 401k died and no one told him) so he could rent them out for a steady source of income
2396 2018-10-15 00:23:52 Lucky charm for cannabis stocks ;) You da man Jim, get @crifici of @AuxlyGroup on @MadMoneyOnCNBC

2398 2018-10-15 00:20:27 Maybe between 7k and 10k! Imagine you invested all of that into stocks, bonds, mutual funds or just a high interest savings account! cha ching
2399 2018-10-15 00:20:23 In a stock market correction, investors should largely stay on the sidelines but remain engaged and build their watch lists. Pay attention to top stocks that are holding up well, such as $AAPL, $MSFT, $ULTA, $UNH, $BSX and $ORLY.  - IBD
2400 2018-10-15 00:18:03 Which stocks are y’all investing in or going to invest?
2401 2018-10-15 00:16:30 #StockMarket futures are little changed in Asia, which should be a relief after last week’s volatility. Many known names will be reported earnings this week and we see earnings coming in solid. Still, we look for quality earnings and balance sheets. #stocks #Bloomberg #CNBC

2403 2018-10-15 00:13:10 2/2 universe too really focus on a even smaller number of stocks and only take A++++ plays outside this universe.
On days like Thu there is so much opprtnity that you have to pay attntn to not get carried away by the vast number of setups. I found less prep on such days is more.
2404 2018-10-15 00:12:02 Say it's not so, back to the study. Penny stocks:
2405 2018-10-15 00:09:55 That stock? Campbell's Soup.

I got it at 20. I bought a full share. The first time i'd done that on the app. I generally took bites at bigger stocks but i knew the name and i thought it was pretty solid...

not long after, it lost a serious chunk of value. Dropping to 18 per.
2406 2018-10-15 00:06:29 I’m on board! And excited that I bought all Canadian pot stocks and they’ve done nothing but grow!  Can’t wait until Wednesday!
2407 2018-10-15 00:05:08 @TBradley90 you still got that list of stocks to practice on?
2408 2018-10-15 00:03:36 The more accurate version: Saudi stocks fall following poor weekly performance on Wall Street.
2409 2018-10-15 00:03:00 $gold $silver stocks....cause when the tide goes out, we're going to see exactly which banks have been making use of the new "flexible" accounting rules, and which corporations are bust.....and @federalreserve will print what they can't steal from peasantry to save their buddies
2410 2018-10-15 00:02:55 Quienes son esas “2 personas q trabajan stocks”?... De seguro los 2 q usaste de referencia cuando dijiste que si Trump ganaba la Bolsa inmediatamente tendría un “crash”... ... y que ha pasado?... LLEVA 80 CLOSINGS MÁS ALTOS EN LA HISTORIA....
