39 2019-03-11 23:43:14 Mila Kunis the ambulance driver is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is unfriended and blocked on myspace by Jersey Shore.
40 2019-03-11 23:42:57 Look at new highs/new lows -- the internals are stronger than ever past two days. It's broad-based buying. It's not like a few leader stocks are holding everything up and the breadth is bad like it was in Oct. top.
41 2019-03-11 23:42:45 $SPY $DJIA $QQQ $IWM  If you saw some show their charts on the major indexes last week, you might have started to get the feeling that stocks had to go down more, based on potential support. Careful spending time imagining (no more than 1 second after sighting) what COULD happen.
42 2019-03-11 23:41:33 Well thats what you haven't learned yet in your career then....You can bash whatever you want of mine...It doesn't concern me...You know why? Solid stocks will go up, Bad stocks will go down, no matter who is saying what....Retail is not the king in this game. $CAVR
43 2019-03-11 23:40:17 Maybe still lots of stocks to be distributed ...
44 2019-03-11 23:39:47 the revolution will be televised
45 2019-03-11 23:38:36 So some stocks don't be on stockpile but be on robinhood and I'm guessing vice versa.
46 2019-03-11 23:36:38 I think it happens when people dump stocks when the price is low, other people buy them up and then sell quick when the price goes back up. This is just what I gathered from following Tesla, which has a lot of short sellers
47 2019-03-11 23:36:12 If YG stocks were blocked from short selling... well, it may be because the risk is VERY high that they will lose a lot in value very soon, and thus many short sellers will try to short sell.

50 2019-03-11 23:35:10 the ventilation systems in work spaces are not triggered for elongated pulmonary breathing or snoring because the sinus clog trigger gives the ventilation investors an added dividend from their stocks @nyquil sudaped etc..?
51 2019-03-11 23:34:26 what does this mean? I don't know much about stocks. Is that considered illegal?
52 2019-03-11 23:32:19 Ha!!! 
I JUST started doing this a while back, in my dividend portfolio.
I played put options on the stocks that were starting to curl back down.
I didn’t wanna sell em bc you don’t get paid if you’re not holding. 
And I couldn’t just sit there and watch/lose $$ on the way down

132 2019-03-11 22:28:27 Lmfao! Please correct the history! @Asad_Umar is on "stay" from court! He is the one who was held responsible for for bringing the stocks down and running the company in deficit!

133 2019-03-11 22:27:28 It's easier to fool someone than convince them they've been fooled. It's classic human behavioral psychology when people have to blame someone other than themselves for their poor judgment buying bunk stocks in the first place. Thanks for saving me $ by sharing that article.

Could be prevented by reasonable gun control (ban bump stocks, assault weapons, no background gun show sales, etc.)?? We owe it to all families to reduce the carnage in this "civilized" country!
136 2019-03-11 22:25:55 Last year I paid heavy taxes on crypto. Went to Jackson hewitt for tax filing. They just taxed me like stocks, Total proceeds less total cost . Lost all gains beginning 2018. Hope this year I can show my all losses the same way. Just trying to make sure it’s ok.
137 2019-03-11 22:25:50 That's my point, I guess massive tax breaks for Corp. to buy back their stocks & Deregulations have also helped the 1%'ers, #Govt has been pulling off this trickle effect for the last 2 yrs.Let's throw the #Americans a bone with a paltry tax break for them ($500)  is not good!!!
138 2019-03-11 22:25:06 Crypto is literally a joke at this point. Stocks are extremely tricky but at least there’s a little more of a chance of making money
139 2019-03-11 22:24:35 Someone else had sent me that, Interesting.
140 2019-03-11 22:24:26 Bump stocks do count. It was a bipartisan bill.  You just hate and divide. You have no truth.

142 2019-03-11 22:23:01 For stocks consider established companies that have some footing in macro trends such as AI, autonomous vehicles, etc.  For crypto you can’t go wrong with BTC or Ethereum (there are others but these are very stronk). Crypto is in a bear market now so a good buying opportunity 
143 2019-03-11 22:23:00 @KamalaHarris You said the good stock market is only good if you own stocks.  It’s a shame that you and your uninformed supporters don’t know that their 401k is tried to the stock market and #union pensions are tried to the stock market.  @AOC @CNN @HuffPost @nytimes @maddow

147 2019-03-11 22:20:16 I would guess many politicians of a certain persuasion are also shorting a few stocks (& Sterling) on the exchanges in the hope of making money from the misery they’re about to inflict on us all.

163 2019-03-11 22:11:12 Long-term budget projections are never unassailable, because they're always wildly wrong - in both directions. The surpluses of 1998-2001 from defense cuts and booming stocks (NOT tax hikes -revenues were a bigger % of GDP in 1989 than in 1994) were totally unexpected by CBO.
164 2019-03-11 22:10:58 C’est sur qu’avec ces lunettes le soleil va se cacher pour ne pas voir ça; donc elles deviendront inutiles;donc il faudra bruler les stocks; bref, si c’est pour devenir pyromane; il faut vraiment acheter ce modèle! (Trop de théories...)

2. Highest Stocks 
3. Border security 
4. Millions lifted off food stamps
197 2019-03-11 21:52:37 SA investors are punishing stocks hard for missing earning. 5-10% in the negative seems to be the norm if they miss earnings expectations- MTN, Woolworths, Shoprite, Aspen- a few recent examples.

203 2019-03-11 21:50:22 #Saas is a good business but some of these stocks are now trading at 20, 25 or 30 times revenue! Historically, this has never ended well.

Sure, they can rally more but a lot of the future growth is already baked in today's prices.

Just saying.
204 2019-03-11 21:50:14 One thing i wanted to know. You talk about stock options. Do you mean getting part of revenue or does valve hold stocks in other companies. Since valve is a private company.

368 2019-03-11 20:15:58 World stocks rally: US +1.5%; Europe +.8%. China trade resolution inklings drove markets higher. Better consumer spending data & a slightly oversold market after Friday's retreat assisted. Best to ignore all this noise & focus on long-term plan. Bias still to upside short-term.
369 2019-03-11 20:15:55 I am writing more on US stocks in the IC. You are probably right that I should have written more in the past.
370 2019-03-11 20:15:39 Not sure I understand. So writing on multiple stocks is unusual and focusing on 1 stock is a more reliable way to go? Writing 50 articles on the same stock is proof that your not pumping $kndi? Strange logic.
371 2019-03-11 20:15:27 When people all over the world borrow money to buy stocks it’s unlikely the market will fall until liquidity becomes an issue.

387 2019-03-11 20:14:19 yep. it's a good thought exercise to look back at the stock price chart and think of all the times you could have thrown in the towel. $4 , $6, .

You are wealthier because you are more patient. Remember that. Stocks don't go in a straight line util you zoom out (a lot).

393 2019-03-11 20:12:06 After taking last week off the bulls came back in force: Stocks surge on latest econ data and despite Boeing plunge.

Nasdaq +2.0% as techs lead the way again. S&P +1.5%, Russell 2000 +1.6%. 

Dow adds 200, +0.8% to 25,650, held back by Boeing's 5.4% plunge after jet crash.

404 2019-03-11 20:08:20 Today is an interesting point about a potential trade Cold War. China grounded all Boeing planes of the same model as the one that crashed. This isn't another salvo in the trade tensions, but it shows what China could do to disrupt US stocks if talks fail. Take note. #SchwabLive

407 2019-03-11 20:07:47 Sometimes it’s tough to use Stops on Penny Stocks as it seems they get taken out with regularity before reversing to the upside. I trade certain Penny Stocks but use a “Mental Stop” in lieu of a formal stop. Prefer PStks that have bounced off Support numerous times in past.
408 2019-03-11 20:07:38 I think Brawler can def struggle to take stocks, but a lot of it boils down to stuff I'm bad at. As I've been getting less terrible at edgeguarding/tech chasing off nair I'm realizing he has a lot more viable kill options.
409 2019-03-11 20:07:29 Nicolas Darvas was in a classic situation where one of his companies/stocks were getting taken over, he was asked through the broker if he'd like to accept a tender offer for $100+ in after-hours trading, he refused, and then the stock proceeded to multiply via the bidding war.

419 2019-03-11 20:02:11 Strength in technology stocks offset weakness in Boeing and turned a 200 point opening loss into a 200 point closing gain for the Dow.  The more widely followed S&P 500 gained 1.4%, erasing 2/3rd of last week's 5 day loss.

428 2019-03-11 19:58:44 Cannabis stocks are a different kind of asset when it comes to liquidity. Liquidity will get better overtime, but we are not there yet. Be careful out there- manage risk and preserve capital
429 2019-03-11 19:58:21 Correlation with Nasdaq is in the 0.5-0.9 range. For stocks, a form of DCA is great. Leaving X% in cash (cash pays around 2% nowadays in the US - every country is different), to be allocated when markets puke their guts out (panic runs are unavoidable).
430 2019-03-11 19:57:53 Wish I was closer to the company's management like I am with my other stocks. Would have been nice to get into that PP ha. But I'm pretty sure it was allocated the instant it was announced.

In many, high priced, stocks the lack of odd lot dissemination means that the SIP quote is MUCH wider than the real quote, which distorts stats like E/Q.

517 2019-03-11 19:06:26 I and everyone called the bottom. I bought then and sold a few years later. Sure I missed the last 5-6 years run up in US stocks, but I did just fine with the 4 years I was all in, and still have been in with about 20% of my portfolio. Still know a crash is due though.

630 2019-03-11 18:00:11 I agree. I focus more on the lower cap stocks, rather than the better plays.

633 2019-03-11 17:59:45 Não tenho dúvida!

663 2019-03-11 17:50:10 Anyways tatamotors is a very good stock for intraday and swing trading. (if you trade it unbiased with an open mind). there r lot of other good stocks for investing purposes. why tatamotors?

690 2019-03-11 17:38:21 mkt looks like a perma buy, as stocks dont care about earnings, politics, war, alien attacks...nope..only interest rates. huge pension funds need a return and are forced to pile in to stocks and the central banks will always keep rates down for the rich keeping the bubble intact
691 2019-03-11 17:38:00 As an analogy comparing portfolio of stocks vs. betting a horse race.

692 2019-03-11 17:37:42 If we continue to run these #FAANG stocks up, it's going to be a sell the news come earnings. Didn't $NFLX get a downgrade, last week? $ETF's are driving these prices up. IMO
693 2019-03-11 17:37:11 Boeing 737 Max 8 needs to be grounded until the Ethiopian investigation is complete. America knows Trump allegedly sold his Boeing shares, but he's a certified liar. Lives matter, not stocks. China & Indonesia have grounded them until further notice.

737 2019-03-11 17:17:52 Stocks took a tumble Friday after the Labor Dept reported just 20,000 net jobs were added in February, significantly below expectations of a 180,000 gain. The tax cuts and stimulus of additional government spending seem to be wearing off, economic growth abroad has weakened.

743 2019-03-11 17:14:55 So then what would you suggest be done? The system clearly isn't working for a large portion of Americans. This latest round of tax cuts had virtually no impact for the middle and lower classes. Businesses took that money and bought back stocks.
744 2019-03-11 17:14:48 Atleast my stocks are doing great today
745 2019-03-11 17:13:55 Please explain exactly what is "rich". What defines too much? And too much of what? Income, assets, investments, stocks, patents, royalties, businesses, farm land?

When butt-hurt "tax the rich" whiners say "rich", it just seems to mean anyone more successful in life than them.
746 2019-03-11 17:13:54 I don’t, sorry. Stocks are really hard. I’d personally recommend moving everything to Robinhood if you can. Their stuff is really good.

● Why they are trading it. fundamentals vs technicals 
● When they're trading ... market timing

756 2019-03-11 17:08:50 @andersonsadvice those are all indices that is why u see the same stocks. they exist in more than 1 index.
757 2019-03-11 17:08:36 Oil stocks have poor long term outlook...not just because of electric cars.
1) too much aging population in developed countries
2) Public transportation in developed countries
3) Fuel efficiency
4) Slow economic growth
758 2019-03-11 17:07:57 At the top of a business cycle, market narratives can quickly shift to bearish from optimistic. Another weak Jobs Report or two will further dampen investor confidence. Even lower interest rates may not be able to keep stocks at current levels.
759 2019-03-11 17:07:54 buying stocks?
760 2019-03-11 17:07:34 @TheHerd tell you want though you all come to work with me any day swing a sleg hammer for 10-12 hours a day just to make enough money to get to the next day yeah not all of us get to live upper middle  class houses with stocks,bonds  and the golden ticket for life s.m.h.

762 2019-03-11 17:06:43 I should not have looked at weed stocks ... Love this little Canadian grower Supreme Cannabis . He grows like a real old school grower , a good one . Long a bunch of  TGODF   someone will buy them .  I Think
763 2019-03-11 17:05:40 Our current model of collective ownership through stocks is just socialism for the rich, bringing corporations under not democratic control but oligarchic control.

Why is socialism-for-the-rich better than socialism-for-all, especially given the lack of economic mobility in USA?
764 2019-03-11 17:05:22 Oh please. You continually champion the toxic #salmon industry, one of the main causes of the near extinction of Scotland’s own native stocks.

769 2019-03-11 16:59:52 Think I’m going to stop using these online broker sites and go back to pick my own stocks. Maybe it’s luck but I’ve been outperforming them all as of late and it’s 100x more fun picking trading yourself anyways

773 2019-03-11 16:59:26 But your consumers would of boycotted the advertisers last week just as u would today. The only difference is you feel you have the leverage or muscle to extort them today so organize an attack knowing most corps avoid any bad press as it effect  stocks. Dont be coy fess up.
774 2019-03-11 16:59:13 Trump supporters- you ok with these cuts that are needed so the billionaires, the Pres and his crime family and corporations (many of which paid no taxes, e.g., Netflix etc) can have a bigger tax break and buy-back stocks. Are you prepared to pay astronomical medical bills?

776 2019-03-11 16:58:01 If this is a strong bullish trend move, there will be frequent shifting of batons among stocks on who is going to support Nifty upmoves. 

My bullish picks for the next leg are :
SunPharma
BPCL
TataSteel
AdaniPorts

Don't ask me for entry/SL/targets, do your own analysis
777 2019-03-11 16:57:38 yes i figured out that you all were promised stock options

that's how you all were bribed, not w/cash but w/something potentially even more lucrative in the long term: stocks

and those stocks just got pulled away from you

20 shares worth over $30k

that's why you all so pissed
778 2019-03-11 16:56:32 I've always traded forex/options/stocks before crypto. 

I dropped the 'i love crypto' brand because it was very generic and there were 400-500 copycats.

Also, Facebook/Youtube have been known to ban accounts with crypto in their name so I wanted to change it all to my own name.

783 2019-03-11 16:54:11 FURU has many fake Twitter accounts of good looking women buying these hot Penny stocks to pump them higher before they dump on you
784 2019-03-11 16:53:34 Not many stocks give you a roadmap.  Considering last quarter was only 55 days of NS revenue, most of the investments haven’t gone down much since, this quarter incl. Nov/Dec, and still waiting for rebate money. No one time financing/purchase costs.  Yes, should be good.
785 2019-03-11 16:53:32 You posted an article about a new board member. So I checked to see if I could get a high paying job, with a corner office and since I know nothing about stocks I can only offer up that I will be there on time every day!

So keep me in mind if a corner office opens up! :)
786 2019-03-11 16:51:49 #investment #stocks Full service conventional brokers always miss the hot stocks because they're "too expensive" - like Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple - all the great tech stocks. You miss the boat becuz they're paranoid about risk. #broker #fail
787 2019-03-11 16:51:23 The company isn't a mess, it's their stocks. I guess BP will rather come back around May the 10th.

789 2019-03-11 16:50:49 That feeling comes when u let noise seep in.
Some ppl have that forte while majority works well when they track select scrips.
This helps to understand the CHARACTER of stocks well.

795 2019-03-11 16:44:59 going long stocks that have broken support with bagholders is how you lose over time.  stick to going long strong stocks with support that held.

just b/c a stock is CHEAP doesn't make it an automatic LONG
just b/c a stock is "too high" doesn't make it an auto SHORT

799 2019-03-11 16:41:44 Heard: "Bonds are useless... Where else (but with stocks) can you get 5% in the next twelve months?"
Umm, the one year US note yields 2.53% - and that's a risk free rate of return. @realmoney
800 2019-03-11 16:40:16 We have cleared a lot of the SRW stocks. HRW we are clearing out the low hanging fruit. Too wide of Kk/KK to want to push the whole inventory to market.
801 2019-03-11 16:39:41 What’s disgusting is CNBC continual use of 12/24 as a reference point from where stocks  have risen . Um did 11-15/12/23 not matter
802 2019-03-11 16:38:46 Its not free its using my tax dollars to benefit me and society. I want my tax dollars to educate my kids not making sure stocks stay above 20k. I want my tax dollars to be use to have access to healthcare instead of endless wars

813 2019-03-11 16:33:30 If you buy a stock it can turn around tomorrow. But you have to take a decision! It makes no sense to buy 3 or more stocks from the same sector. There are always 1 or 2 leaders. Find them …
814 2019-03-11 16:33:19 Unfortunately Central Banks have massively distorted the valuation of stocks

833 2019-03-11 16:26:58 Agreed and the nature of the beast with so many stocks but even back in 2008 there was plenty of time to head for the safety of cash and sell as the price and MAs rolled over. Wish I had a working Tardis, that would make life & investing fun & easy!

872 2019-03-11 16:07:27 I recommend Betterment if you don’t have any idea how to invest in stocks or ETFs. It has low costs and you can literally start an account with 0 bucks. If you are a little more aware then go with Robinhood

884 2019-03-11 16:03:43 Scanning scrips pls shed some light. how do u scan and spot script where short covering might happen. Thats when option buyers makes a killing. especially for me i only track 10 to 12 stocks and actively at a time 3 stocks & if there is no trade setup i just sit whole day
885 2019-03-11 16:03:17 money feels rushed to get in. barely missed my bid in $NVTA. imo even the stronger setups need more time to develop and stick. if they dont, i think we more prone to sliding and falling further, like the rocks off an unsupported mountainside. #SPY #stocks

905 2019-03-11 15:52:58 It doesn't need to be declared a national emergency. You just need to start taxing the rich again. Perhaps a law that the amount of CEO compensation that exceeds x times the lowest paid worker in the company will be taxed at 100% (includes stocks etc that they give them).

909 2019-03-11 15:52:19 It all boils down to having the discipline to save. If you can save let's say 10% of your wages over a period of time, you can buy or invest in income generating assets. Bonds,Stocks, a business , investments etc.
910 2019-03-11 15:51:47 It was co incidental the stocks crashing.  And the Fed raised interest at the same time

1008 2019-03-11 15:08:55 Yes, that’s true about all factors. ESG factors, like all fundamental factors, are inputs to a process. We don’t use screens of any sort on any metric in our process. They are too blunt and we think opportunities often exist in stocks where superficial screens make them look bad.

1011 2019-03-11 15:08:10 But again... how does avoiding these stocks help society? That was the initial question posed that you responded to saying was the wrong question. But for non-investment related ESG proponents, that is perhaps the only question.

1164 2019-03-11 13:58:26 right, there was a big gap during the dot-com boom when the Dow refused to include Nasdaq-listed stocks. So silly.

1170 2019-03-11 13:56:59 That’s the primary thing, though. ‘Race’, as it’s popularly understood in Western societies, has as its centre the assumption of biologically distinct categories. Those don’t exist. So ‘race’ is a social construct, born out of the history of slavery and exploitation

1176 2019-03-11 13:54:42 The Dow does an amazingly good job of mirroring the market even though the price weighting of stocks is archaic.
Obviously, when one of the 30 stocks goes haywire there is nothing that can be done.
1177 2019-03-11 13:54:37 Very weak sir but possible cos there is only rotation in this upmove of nifty no much breaking ranges in stocks have happened yet..
1178 2019-03-11 13:54:25 DJIA is a garbage stat: based on only 30 companies, and it's weighted on price, not market cap. Basically, you should always use S&P500 rather than DJIA if the intent is to show how "the market" for major stocks is doing

1188 2019-03-11 13:50:58 Stocks higher as Powell gets on the dove train. He might not have to raise interest rates again for the rest of his term. White House projects 3% growth forever.  We know that’s not going to happen. Nor did it last year. I think 2.5% is more likely and a rate cut.

1246 2019-03-11 13:29:38 When the markets are in a bull phase, everyone wants to buy faster than the neighbor. 

And stocks hit the upper circuit for days together, thus, getting expensive by the day.

Investors are distressed when they are not able to buy.

1336 2019-03-11 12:46:34 Nobody is taking a victory lap over an airline crash, that would be silly.
The call was technical, the stock dropped 6% last week before the crash.
The technical rationale was: Highly extended stocks are subject to reversal and event risk.
Nobody can know the tiggers in advance.

1. Dump their failing stocks 2. Boycott 3. Coordinate on alternative

1360 2019-03-11 12:30:00 This statement talks against clear-cut lines that divide people neatly into categories, and says that instead it’s a gradient. I agree with this.

1369 2019-03-11 12:25:01 Quite interesting article .. immediately compared few of my mutual fund investment and the stocks in portfolio ..The returns are quite relatable now ..
1370 2019-03-11 12:24:26 Yes in some markets & some stocks, it all depends what you choose & when.

Seen many stocks perform well last few weeks where others haven't.

All i know is sentiment spreads quite quickly & will wait for all the bears to get saturated then it will be the massive opp as always.

1383 2019-03-11 12:15:00 What effect do you think that would have on TRY denominated assets(stocks, bonds etc.)?
1384 2019-03-11 12:13:46 You know because K-ELF are controlling them with those sm stocks so they are afraid
Just if we have the power to bought those stocks...

1392 2019-03-11 12:09:47 Prior to the EU the British fish industry had almost fished cod into extinction - could be argued that they only have an industry now due to the EU rules. We will see how well they conserve stocks post Brexit.

1429 2019-03-11 11:32:22 Personally I think stocks and bonds and prize winning should not be taxed. These things stimulate the economy create jobs with higher wage and benefits for working people and encourages more people to invest and play the lottery that pays for many state and local projects.

1431 2019-03-11 11:32:08 buying stocks is an idea i had back in 2017.. at that time it made sense at least cuz looking at it yg is 2019 a sinking ship cuz even if they get cleared from everything the witch-hunt will continue till they fall
1432 2019-03-11 11:32:06 BTW muss man bei ETFs auch extrem differenzieren. Das ist wie bei Aktien. Es gibt Blue Chips und Penny Stocks.

Ich interessiere mich vor allem für Index Investing. Da sind ETFs Mittel zum Zweck aber sicher nicht Zweck an sich.

1470 2019-03-11 11:06:08 The whole concept of race is a social construct. It's a culturally-variable system that is used to organise people into socially relevant categories. These categories are arbitrary, & not useful for understanding biological variation.

1482 2019-03-11 10:52:27 Boeing stocks dropping, more countries are grounding the Boeing 737 Max, Boeing had to suspend the unveiling of a new plane after the plane crash. Now what else can be worse for Boeing? they've got a lot of explaining to do...technically

1566 2019-03-11 09:53:07 If we inflate this concept with additional societal expectations and concepts that I’ve seen thrown around like ‘blackness’ or ‘whiteness’, that doesn’t make the whole concept of race a social construct, right?
1567 2019-03-11 09:52:52 The traders did not sell the stocks because of your boycott. They instead bought more. Shows that this campaign doesn't matter. The perception of HUL remains unchanged. Better luck next time

1658 2019-03-11 08:33:42 If there is this much growth in salaried class stocks in Indian economy will be massive. Also when u need money for emergency or luxury what do you do -- sell the bathroom? With MF u can sell some units
1659 2019-03-11 08:32:25 For example #MothersonSumi and most of the auto pack, Nocil, NATCO, #YesBank for sure were heavily sold into, all good names but I think the broader market over did the selling trying to ride the momentum. A lot of stocks were in defined downward channel formations, improving now
1660 2019-03-11 08:32:04 No one can assure anything unless FD. That was my point even the best case you cited is not that great when u factor in interest cost. Also 1 q A flat in NM-80L.  10x to 8Cr is feasible in 15 yrs? So salaried class can take loans of 7Cr ! If that is possible better be in stocks

1957 2019-03-11 03:50:37 Might be because the Federal Reserve printed up $4 trillion dollars to bail out the banksters on Wall St.  Money is subject to the laws of supply and demand too. The Fed devalued the currency we get paid with to inflate the currency ( stocks ) Wall St. gets paid with.

2067 2019-03-11 01:41:02 Been experimenting trading $spx and its a different beast that’s for sure. Probably just going to go back to the FAANG stocks plus a few other big names. Will start posting more in the near future
2068 2019-03-11 01:40:59 It’s really difficult to predict stocks these days! 
2069 2019-03-11 01:39:14 "Tide goes in, tide goes out." - Bill OReilly  You think you're a genius because one of the most volatile stocks in the market is down?  LOL.  When it's down, you're a genius, but when it goes up, its some kind of fraud?  You should have a show in CNBC.
2070 2019-03-11 01:36:58 Same as their corn stocks
2071 2019-03-11 01:36:00 Any Investment In Renewable Energy Is Gold Positive Because It Disrupts  The Recycling Of Foreign Oil Sales Back Into US Stocks, Bonds. The  Arcane World Of Oil Profits And Balance Of Payments (Michael Hudson)  Will Leave The USD Without Financing On A Long Downward Journey
2072 2019-03-11 01:35:37 Slowly building up my coinbase USD wallet for the next major dip. If #BTC goes under 3,500; I'm ready. And if it drops to 2k, I start selling stocks in my brokerage account

2077 2019-03-11 01:32:18 Buy stocks in companies raping children and destroying the white working class?
2078 2019-03-11 01:30:02 Who cares about stocks $SPY $SPX $ES_F a month from now is the best weekend in history...final round of @TheMasters followed by the premiere of @GameOfThrones. If I die ill die a happy man.
2079 2019-03-11 01:28:35 Rainbow unicorn was my first one. Haven’t tried the others yet, but the gym stocks a few flavors now.  I liked it but it gave me quite a rush since I’m not used to that much caffeine. Was crazy lol
2080 2019-03-11 01:28:11 I should spend my money on a chiropractor visit and maybe invest in stocks.....but maybe I want to buy pet jellyfish instead?
2081 2019-03-11 01:27:22 Future group promoters have pledge the stocks , be careful
2082 2019-03-11 01:26:21 Je pensais que j'avais acheté plus de manger pour Shigu mais non en fait va falloir que j'aille faire les stocks demain
2083 2019-03-11 01:25:55 After Democratic Convention, it would probably be a good time to invest in pitchfork and guillotine stocks.
2084 2019-03-11 01:25:54 Sir I request you to please conduct one live class on how to trade your watchlist . I have also observed some of your watch list stocks move a day or two later
2085 2019-03-11 01:24:44 Modern day stocks?
2086 2019-03-11 01:23:23 I love recurring revenue growth stocks.
2087 2019-03-11 01:23:03 For who? You do know over 50% of America doesn’t have stocks? 
So unless you are lying like just about all Trumpers who will justify anything to support a lying, cheating, Russian Loving Traitor, or you don’t know any better!
2088 2019-03-11 01:22:46 The market alternates between periods of running and periods of resting. The growth-stock glamours are largely extended from basing patterns and are in need of rest. Let's respect the need for secondary setups to be built. The mkt will come to us, if we let it #stocks
2089 2019-03-11 01:19:01 more people have stocks now and they have there 401's that are making more money. The caution is over since the stock market is doing great. Long term stock holders are the happy ones,. Lying on this does no good no one believes any thing you say
2090 2019-03-11 01:18:34 The US economy is good, stocks markets have never been higher than today, companies are more than happy with tax cuts, this is enough for Trump to be reelected and keep America great during his 2nd term.
2091 2019-03-11 01:17:24 Nice presentation
Detailed inputs of volume
Though I have considered many points of presentation in my view

Stocks selection the key here
2092 2019-03-11 01:17:07 Exceptions to every rule. Even then, most pro athletes aren’t legitimately wealthy. Wealth = commodities, businesses, real estate and stocks/bonds. Cash disappears, wealth keeps feeding you indefinitely.
2093 2019-03-11 01:16:16 Ah damn. But good to know because our R1 stocks Red Bull

2096 2019-03-11 01:12:27 Breaking: flag in hot stocks leading to max negative return for retail traders, HFT to blame suggests impassioned Carney.
2097 2019-03-11 01:11:40 The rare instance someone repeatedly rematches in Smash online is always nice

Played a lot of fun matches with someone with the Smash Tag Kaito, very stylish Jigglypuff. Reminded me to never get overconfident even if the opponent is down 2 stocks.
2098 2019-03-11 01:10:59 Talk about hypocrites - how about the arms dealers stocks that your members run to buy every time you vote to increase the Pentagon budget - your hypocrisy is ridiculous. Why don't you mention your REAL plans to rip off the public for the #MorbidlyRich . . .
2099 2019-03-11 01:10:45 Tax cuts. For the corporations who were supposed to put it back into the average Joe worker. You know what they did right? Gave us all a one time bonus of a few hundred dollars, and used the rest to buy back their own stocks. It benefits us in no way. Unless you are too 1%
2100 2019-03-11 01:10:39 Because opioid stocks will never crash
2101 2019-03-11 01:08:28 Ive been fiending to get back to the trade desk! Who's ready for Monday?!?!!!!!!?!! #trader #stocks #daytrader #DayTrading #MondayMotivation
2102 2019-03-11 01:07:36 Yup no bid risk is greater than the reward. Follow the money and stick to stocks w catalysts and momo...companies who easily provide updates
2103 2019-03-11 01:07:24 I’d say Torrid but my location only stocks up to a size like 2 in active wear

2105 2019-03-11 01:01:16 How are ppl gonna buy stocks without entering the workforce?
2106 2019-03-11 01:00:16 Buying low P/E stocks works in both good markets & bad. You may have to wait a little longer for your return in a bear market. -- Chris Browne

2109 2019-03-11 00:56:22 Thinking about building my passive income by investing in stocks and selling foot pics
2110 2019-03-11 00:54:47 Make sure you get some dividend stocks
2111 2019-03-11 00:47:41 People are forgetting that picking individual stocks is simply way more fun! That being said, follow JC's advice...first 10k in an ETF.
2112 2019-03-11 00:47:22 Got it. My expertise is really surrounding bio stocks traded on major US exchanges so this is a bit outside of my area of knowledge.
2113 2019-03-11 00:46:43 In stocks and in life if we get 7 out of 10 decisions right and minimize the impact of the wrong ones we will be ok.
2114 2019-03-11 00:42:24 Studying Stocks...  
2115 2019-03-11 00:40:17 Comprehensive planning, SS advising, Medicare, mortgage, selling biz, estate planning, emotional, et all are important, but how does one justify coming up with a fee for this advice based on the AUM of an unrelated portfolio of stocks, bonds, and funds? Makes no sense.
2116 2019-03-11 00:38:47 buying stocks in posting
2117 2019-03-11 00:38:10 Lol..same here..not going 
2118 2019-03-11 00:35:37 Still learning the penny game - figured if penny stock was .0001 it could only go up butvif no bid like u stayed couldn’t I just sell it? If I’ve played it the Amy of times I’ve asked ppl I’d already be up thousands by now on the stocks pattern and only need up .0001 each time
2119 2019-03-11 00:35:18 Most of these stocks are defying gravity... especially FMG and CBA
2120 2019-03-11 00:33:39 

Bring back THE PUBLIC STOCKS!

"LIAR!"
Like Madoff, Shkreli, EpiPen's Bresch + her mother + E. Holmes + S. Miller, there are certain modern American villains whose grotesquely greedy and egregious acts are Crimes Against Society, ergo deserving of 
CIVIC PUNISHMENT.
2121 2019-03-11 00:32:32 Big day in #stocks tomorrow let’s get this bag 
2122 2019-03-11 00:30:04 I don’t get involved in predicting day to day movement of stocks that are subject of our whistleblowing. Makes no difference to me, other than their  staying in business to pay the fines.
2123 2019-03-11 00:29:57 For people like this the old mediaeval punishment of being put in the stocks and the people of Birmingham then throwing rotten vegetables at him would seem most appropriate. Then again maybe hung drawn and quartered is even better.
2124 2019-03-11 00:29:06 Stocks on our radar for 3/11:
CMTL: Band Value -20.15%; current price 21.32% below avg
DLX: Band Value -26.18%; current price 26.94% below avg
DY: Band Value -41.22%; current price 42.13% below avg
NWE: Band Value +20.11%; current price 18.95% above avg
2125 2019-03-11 00:27:52 And yet I bet the average investor in those stocks is up about 6% (before fees). #letwinnersrun
2126 2019-03-11 00:27:00 @SenWarren Stop your trying to take down Amazon. Our stocks dropped and our family lost money.  You are out of touch ang ignorant.  Amazon has provided jobs delivering goods and saved the USPS.  Come on
2127 2019-03-11 00:26:14 Just checking back! I’m still available for that job at the fool with the corner office, excellent pay and a know nothing about stocks, go get um attitude?
2128 2019-03-11 00:25:45 Where does Jeff Bezos’s wealth come from then? People spend money to buy stock cuz it has no value? Stock has value on market, Jeff Bezos holds a lot of it. When the market value of that stock rises, his net wealth increases too. That’s how stocks work. Read about it sometime
2129 2019-03-11 00:25:24 Urban Decay naked basics palette! Can’t go wrong also good cruelty free company. Mecca stocks. X
2130 2019-03-11 00:24:49 Lmao bighit you underestimated ARMY's buying power again. Prepare your servers, pre-order links and album stocks for the next comeback please
2131 2019-03-11 00:24:41 What if that is true? Then where do you make money? Short stocks and long bonds and gold?
2132 2019-03-11 00:24:11 "Took 12 stocks"
2133 2019-03-11 00:23:53 Complete lies, again.  I know the stock market isn’t “the economy” but stocks haven’t done anything under Trump.  The average market return was more than twice as much per year under Obama as it has been per year under Trump.  That’s a fact. Trump’s trade war screwed us.
2134 2019-03-11 00:23:19 Thank you.  The MS trend template is just the first step.. a qualifier. That should help narrow down the market to stocks in uptrends. Best wishes!
2135 2019-03-11 00:22:34 Disagree. Uber is not a straight alternative to car ownership. People use it when they can’t afford the costs of owning.

Being long would would mean owning construction stocks. Get ready for road infrastructure to be the hot topic.
2136 2019-03-11 00:21:57 Lori asked if I had any stocks...
Me “ I got socks.”
2137 2019-03-11 00:21:16 They tend to invest. If not in companies in stocks, or even bonds or whatever. The question is at what point is doing that worth it to them. Just saying the more you tax something the less you tend to get of it. They didnt raise cigarrette taxes to increase smoking.
2138 2019-03-11 00:20:31 That is true. Exactly true. Except the middle class continues to shrink while the wealthy get richer by rigging the system in their favor. Most of the recent tax cuts were used to buy back stocks. The GOP have governed as fiscal liberals for a generation, so deceit is our reward
2139 2019-03-11 00:18:40 there’s a T.I. song where it’s like “now I’m watching stocks like what’s the options” and I’m calling bullshit on that one, there’s like absolutely zero chance he knows anything about derivatives
2140 2019-03-11 00:18:37 Do you recommend playing oil with stocks or futures? Or both? Are there any stocks you might be buying or looking at?
2141 2019-03-11 00:13:38 THE STOCKS?!
2142 2019-03-11 00:13:30 You don't really understand how stocks work, do you?

Stocks don't have any real value and Amazon stock isn't something a low level employee would want. That's why all of management will continue to receive their stock rewards. Only Amazon's low level employees have been cut off.
2143 2019-03-11 00:13:26 absolutely, don’t you know that you can invest your Savings in buying Stocks of the 7 sins at Wall Street?!!!
2144 2019-03-11 00:12:43 To be clear though, I absolutely think white Americans MUST pay financially in some way for the crime against humanity that was and is slavery. I just want that financial boost to be a lasting impact. What about investment? Stocks in government companies?
2145 2019-03-11 00:12:32 Flushed out tech stocks are the new immunotherapy stocks.
2146 2019-03-11 00:11:58 AB finessed tf out the steelers.... and good for him. These front offices treat these guys like stocks. Buy low and sell high. AB peeped game. Right on bro. Get yours
2147 2019-03-11 00:11:53 But we let them shoot guns with high capacity mags and bump stocks. How about we don’t let any minors shoot a gun until they’re 18. If they’re too young to vote, they’re too young to have a tool whose sole purpose is to kill. Hmmm, vote or kill. Tough choice, right?
2148 2019-03-11 00:10:31 did that shit say 7 stocks
2149 2019-03-11 00:10:11 Remain bearish with limited upside, marijuana stocks,,
Including $NBEV
2150 2019-03-11 00:07:53 He’s always been afraid smdh WWE needs to get with the time already or watch their stocks drop lower & lower
2151 2019-03-11 00:05:31 If Gustafson doesn't win NPOY, the people who vote for such things should be tarred, feathered, put in the stocks, and left to rot in the desert for eternity.
2152 2019-03-11 00:05:31 Zafar Bhai ... Any stocks/ theme’s you think can create wealth for next 4 years ?
2153 2019-03-11 00:03:04 Dude, what's wrong with people, Seriously, So their expectations is if you put ($500,000 dollars) 1/2 million dollars into the market you can only expect to get back a $10,000 profit for an "Entire" year, and they call our trading of otc stocks questionable.
2154 2019-03-11 00:02:24 Try being bearish on cut stocks for a living....  Traumatically enjoyable
2155 2019-03-11 00:01:16 Norway Govt. 1 Trillion Dollar Sovereign Wealth Fund which owes its wealth to Oil and Gas , selling more than one hundred Oil stocks ( particularly exploration stocks )
Does it mean anything  at all ? 
2156 2019-03-11 00:00:09
