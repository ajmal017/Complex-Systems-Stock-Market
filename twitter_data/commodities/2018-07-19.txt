2 2018-07-19 23:44:57 Wrong. This is how business was being run & commodities obtained....at the time. Trump knew this was wrong & set out to change it. Why do you have a problem with this? Americans who voted for Trump voted for the man. Voters were wse to know he is our only shot at staying American

16 2018-07-19 22:33:00 I’ve been thinking through similar analogs. Any thoughts on the relationship between valuation of commodities and value creation from public utilities?
17 2018-07-19 22:32:28 The idea is that the gov creates industry and the citizens are share holders. The prices of commodities are kept artificially low through leveraging of profits as well as taxation. It is hard to go into a deep erudite discussion / explanation on Twitter :/

41 2018-07-19 22:28:46 Why don't you start by speaking out against tariffs, especially tariffs on soybeans and other Ag commodities, you do remember you represent a farm state right. To hell with the party of Trump, try sticking up for your constituents.
42 2018-07-19 22:28:42 Yes but the question is whether those will have any value on the job market which if you make a simple supply/demand analysis probably means no.

Everyone have emotions, every one have intuition and everyone human is well Human. So they are all commodities.
43 2018-07-19 22:27:11 Basta de llorar viejo. Tienen el mismo discurso que en el 2008, cuando tenian los precios de los commodities volando por las nubes. Y aun asi se negaban a pagar retenciones moviles. El primer proyecto era un adefesio, pero el q salio de diputados era inmensamente mejor.
44 2018-07-19 22:22:54 Same for Chandler. May change as season goes on, but Sixers are again a 52-win team that can’t populate guard slots with known commodities for 48 minutes a game

49 2018-07-19 22:04:13 There are only a few valuable commodities in the world to own gold,silver,any platinum metal group metals and rare earth metals... Gemstones are good too when you have paper backed by trillions of dollars of dept and the US Government people better stockpile the real commodities.
50 2018-07-19 21:57:47 That’s true. Fundamentals play a more important role when it comes to commodities than a model number. 
Nothings perfect that’s for sure. 
But, there’s like a certain “floor” which some commodities can go before producers stop making it. 
Not saying silver necessarily. But overal
51 2018-07-19 21:45:07 In the day we’d sweat it out on the streets,
Fine tuning our risk models and using complicated computerized trading models to first locate underpriced equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities and then use short selling to take advantage of upward or downward price momentum

54 2018-07-19 21:29:29 $1,190 will be the low for AU. Take out the stops at $1.200 and then the banksters will let commodities run. Strong AU, AG, CU and ZN rally. Oil and gas will likely rally, too. Agree w/ Tord, two to three month rally.
55 2018-07-19 21:20:43 The only thing this affects is the sequence. The China-related stuff (industrials, commodities, etc.) start going down first, but eventually everything risky and overvalued goes down hard. Again, see 2015-6. We're seeing the same sequence this time around.

64 2018-07-19 20:44:13 UK can quite easily stop buying in Irish butter, cheese, cider, meat. All these commodities available here in the UK, outside the EU. That's a lot of exports & revenue missing from the Irish Treasury post- #Brexit  .... someone should remind the Irish we're their best customers.
65 2018-07-19 20:38:31 Agreed. Adoption should NEVER be about finding a baby for a family. Rather, it should be about finding a family for a child. Children are not commodities.
66 2018-07-19 20:25:54 Import quotas by limiting physical quantities tend to raise the prices of commodities to which they apply. While this is generally true also of a tariff, a compensatory decrease in price from abroad can often mitigate it in the case of tariffs.
67 2018-07-19 20:25:35 I'm living for the day that i'll turn on my TV on a random Sunday to see "Tanaka's Amazing Commodities" playing, along with the characteristic theme. I'd probably even buy something lol.
68 2018-07-19 20:19:59 It makes a lot of sense if you have any experience investing money. 

"I'm gonna buy stock for £2000 a share. But I'm super okay with having to pay £4.7m months from now to keep my original stocks, unless the company sells commodities, then I won't have to pay anything!"


69 2018-07-19 20:17:52 On the contrary, the personification of an empty dwelling place clearly represents the fetishization of commodities, the Marxist alienation of people from the things we create.

79 2018-07-19 19:43:40 I fully agree but we also shouldn't forget that commodities such as land are the centers of power and affluence without which one remains a tenant in a place where the landlord dictates your behaviour, movement and all.

116 2018-07-19 17:34:03 $USDZAR - Buy ZAR. Dollar dropping fast as FX war between US and China is ON. Chinese weakened CNH and now Trump talking down Dollar. Should put a bid under EM and commodities. Below 13.48, it is likely ZAR trade down to 13.35
117 2018-07-19 17:33:26 And a valid one my friend. Rather than get caught up in the politics, I am watching the historical low ratio between commodities and equities as a MAJOR trading opp in maybe, the not-so-distant future.

122 2018-07-19 17:20:42 See ignoring Trump’s love of coal, just like his crimes. I think that trade is a powerful incentive for peace. Also China controls what 90% of rare earth metals, so it’s not “important” commodities that are being discussed. Unless your all steel smartphone is superior?
123 2018-07-19 17:19:55 I have been hammering the point of potential inflation tearing it up, and even possible stagflation-with wages stagnant, should the dollar fall and rates remain low, the commodities opps are palpable

127 2018-07-19 17:13:14 The implications for inflation are clear. And thus the impact on rising gold prices and commodities, weaker $, and ultimately lower p/es. This is the 70x playbook all over again.

134 2018-07-19 16:56:44 JPY/KRW/Euro cross rates matter as selling interchangeable exports, not so much for rest of Asian EM which is largely selling commodities into China; recent JPY weakness exacerbated by renewed surge in retail outflows into Italian bonds etc,, wrong footing macro funds long yen
135 2018-07-19 16:55:56 It is the reality of our time. We are commodities on social media market. We are worth likes and retweets. The more of that we get. The more eudomaenic and dopaminic feelings we get. So we enhance our values. Even if that means taking a photo half naked or stark naked.

140 2018-07-19 16:48:39 I don't think I would agree that the debate on commodities was obscure when he wrote it, plus I think there is a value to reading the entirety of a key work - not for everyone, of course.

182 2018-07-19 14:34:10 Eh, somewhat true, but I feel that we can be better served by taxing commodities than income. People are going to spend it regardless, and more income typically allows for better quality of life. The thing I liked about Trump is his tax cut gave me $40 extra every week.

350 2018-07-19 05:00:02 Commodities: Ethanol -0.85%, Rice +0.72%
351 2018-07-19 04:55:15 This  should be not for profit. Living beings must be treated as such not commodities.  This system needs a complete overall with changes desperately needed. 
352 2018-07-19 04:54:00 I wonder when China is going to make the announcement that they want their $1.19 Trillion as of March 2018 from the U.S. ? This escalating Trade War can have serious World-wide consequences. #Stocks #Commodities #Tradewar #Forex #Agriculture
353 2018-07-19 04:30:27 tô estudando um exercício que o professor deu com milho e farelo de soja

professor o senhor não vai me mudar as commodities na hora da prova que daí fodeu
354 2018-07-19 04:19:33 Do you want a completely untaxable commodities market to operate underneath the law and IRS observation?  Because prohibition works really well if you want to enrich gangsters.
355 2018-07-19 04:19:16 Oh you’re not getting a quad, you know those are hot commodities
356 2018-07-19 04:12:05 Let me qualify that - non essential commodities, which other people besides yourself notice the consumption.
357 2018-07-19 04:10:31 Exactly. Majority of  people (who caste their vote) buy these commodities directly from vegetable vendors/ weekly markets around their neighborhood & know the real prices. I am one of them.
358 2018-07-19 04:00:16 So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
359 2018-07-19 03:55:48 That’s a billion dollar question. If this was a stock ETF or commodities ETF I would agree with CBOE ticking all the box. Because all the Box are known to everybody. With #crypto there can be boxes that are not known even to SEC today which they may come to know tomorrow
360 2018-07-19 03:42:53 So instead of businesses and trading currency for commodities we all just give our stuff to the mob and pray that they are generous...pass
361 2018-07-19 03:38:16 I follow a theory that has worked in commodities, stocks & forex. Based on that theory we can go not only to 6800 but eventually to 5750 & break lover to sub 5000 

But this is my first few months in #crypto & I need to test this theory to check if it works here

363 2018-07-19 03:29:12 Thanks!  Good question -- the House Ag Committee deals with CFTC regulations & jurisdiction because farmers/ranchers/etc. are active in the commodities & futures markets.  So if Congress plans to expand CFTC jurisdiction over crypto, the legislation could come from House Ag.
364 2018-07-19 03:28:36 Shit lol I get mine thru commodities

366 2018-07-19 03:27:42 It is mutually acceptable anyway ,why do the universities have to buy commodities elsewhere whereas Chandaria has got 'all' what they want?

368 2018-07-19 03:04:03 I don't care about Osiris and I didn't claim anything about Osiris.  These products aren't considered commodities, so there isn't direct competition with bidding and $MDXG sets the prices, which seem like they may be different from commercial prices and AmnioFix prices.  Capiche?
369 2018-07-19 02:56:09 Defended Western financial control of the extraction and marketing of African commodities from the threat of Libya's efforts to use an African currency to finance African commodities markets.
370 2018-07-19 02:55:29 Lo que pasa es que ese tipo de intercambio no nos sirve, hace que nos roben los commodities imprimiendo billetes.
371 2018-07-19 02:50:04 You getting into commodities?
(BTW HV wiring in tesla is not copper)
372 2018-07-19 02:37:10 Again, they are extensions of my self, I do not own my self, I simply am my self. I own the potential labor I can contribute, but my mind and body aren't commodities.

377 2018-07-19 02:20:29 Tal cual. El mercado del dolar, liquidisimo. El de commodities, el más amarrado por fundamentales -oferta, demanda, inventarios, etc., aunque tiene lo suyo de irracionalidad/manipulación-.

Es hasta de dar ternura cuando se van solas las acciones. Como niño que sube la reja.
378 2018-07-19 02:12:13 Idk about the reasons. Masculinity treats femininity as a complement and a partnership. Deficient masculinity treats femininity as obedient nourishers. Toxic masculinity  treats them as commodities. I don't know why some women don't see these toxic symptoms as warning signs
379 2018-07-19 02:06:33 Well duh, buying resale commodities for micro-pennies on the dollar is the American way.
380 2018-07-19 02:04:08 he is delusional. He also thinks that women should sell their bodies because prostitution is a job he views women as commodities to be sold and bought like a product on the Shelf

382 2018-07-19 01:39:01 El cobre es la madre de todos los commodities dice @cristiannmillo si sube el cobre suben todos. Tuiter puede ser muy instructivo también. Fighting & learning
383 2018-07-19 01:33:08 Sii. A medida q disminuya  la guerra comercial suben los commodities.
384 2018-07-19 01:29:51 There is no "mix". The two are predicated about very different property relations, modes of production, and views on commodities. A fusion of the two cannot exist because the two systems are fundamentally opposed at all angles.
385 2018-07-19 01:27:07 Yes the lessons I learned is watching a fool - that’s you - trying to explain commodity prices to an investment banker whose firm trades commodities -  and also when presented with facts about Trumps medical condition simply ignores it lol. Once again, you lose yuge!
386 2018-07-19 01:25:16 Never stand with Anyone who kidnaps, drugs, kennels & disperses kids young as toddlers & can't track them. How do I know they're still in the US? It's a nasty world & ALL kids Need Us to protect them from those who see them as Commodities! We needn't sacrifice Decency for Safety.
387 2018-07-19 01:25:16 I was with you at the MEDEF meeting in Accra last month. Cashew processing and trade are aligned to commodities business model which Touton deals in. Will like to share our cashew business opportunity with you. Please email me or share your email- chukwuemeka.nnaji@gmail.com

390 2018-07-19 01:12:00 Too bad they don’t have any commodities that’ll bring them much back in return
391 2018-07-19 01:07:08 Animals can teach us so much but instead of viewing them as teachers motherfuckers treat them as commodities
392 2018-07-19 01:06:43 Still plans to send it to England as they don’t have enough. Water is going to become one of the world’s most important commodities, and England needs additional supplies.
393 2018-07-19 01:05:42 I didn’t say losses are good for farmer - I simply informed you that soybean prices topped a few years ago. We trade commodities lol - and also gave you facts about trumps known medical condition - try another subject
394 2018-07-19 01:00:19 The commodities index tend to zig
395 2018-07-19 00:57:36 then there’s the question of what aid is good at... think evidence suggests it’s really bad at accomplishing a lot of what folks want most (jobs, economic growth) but far better at delivering biomedical interventions and commodities (which themselves have spillover Econ benefits)
396 2018-07-19 00:57:04 Commodities tend to zig

398 2018-07-19 00:55:01 4/10 were commodities in 2010
399 2018-07-19 00:52:48 I don't disagree that commodities shouldn't be subject to tie-ins, my point is, Chrome, Search/Assistant, Maps, Docs, and other Android bundling are commodities now, not businesses. Calling the bundling of these on Android abusive seems like hypocrisy to me.
400 2018-07-19 00:40:15 @AnilSinghviZEE Thank you for Special 46 episode. Superb and beyond comparison episode. Please start a daily program on Currency market and start more commodities daily shows , atleast 3-4 more . We can also have BTSTT for commodities at 10 or 10.30 PM.

404 2018-07-19 00:24:42 Like technologically speaking we’ve advanced far enough for everyone to have basic necessities: water, food, shelter. 

But our love for toys, commodities, and greed, is killing our planet and our humanity.

406 2018-07-19 00:19:29 Comenzaré a diseñar un modo de explotar ese talento. Te ofrezco commodities. Ja!
407 2018-07-19 00:17:09 Thanks for sharing, Alex.  The opportunities in commodities are generally good - provided that we pay close attention to the Central Bankers and politicians...
408 2018-07-19 00:08:54 Always wishing to remain strongest 3rd world country. These commodities should be given regardless of candidacy promises for your people.  Say something else...
409 2018-07-19 00:05:29 A direct result of a weakened dollar would be a price increase across the board on a variety of commodities. Most Americans probably care more about the price of milk, gas, or Netflix than the national debt which is probably why the gov’t never pulled the trigger on this.
