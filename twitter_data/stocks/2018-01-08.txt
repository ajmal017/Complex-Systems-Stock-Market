4 2018-01-08 23:57:56 They hate it when you give facts.  When you have to flip burgers, and stocks shelves at Wal-Mart,  because your high paying energy job was eliminated by the government, they will count that as two jobs. When a town of industry loses it's  industry, the burger and Walmart jobs go.

12 2018-01-08 23:51:56 I think you've alluded to this, but if you have an interest in sustainability over time you *have* to consider stocks as well as flows. Stock depletion/repletion (eg of available investment funds or talent to run enterprises) will ultimately determine outcomes.

40 2018-01-08 23:44:33 Take 10% from your paycheck. Invest it. It will take time, but eventually it will grow into something meaningful. I understand that something else may have to be sacrificed, but it is worth it. It is the only way to truly set you free financially. Don’t buy things, buy stocks.

42 2018-01-08 23:42:50 $SPY I'm not so much focused on the stock of the day but rather which stocks I believe will likely be there next. Are you watching my post?
43 2018-01-08 23:41:57 Plz.  What else can you say about $AAPL? Seems like you guys talk about the same stocks week after week. Can we have a FAANG free week on the show?  There are other stocks in the market. Txs!

51 2018-01-08 23:38:08 $BSX mental 20% is that it?

What’s the difference between $BSX and most other “Cobalt” stocks?

$BSX is cheaper, cashed up, has a tight register and is ECONOMIC to mine
52 2018-01-08 23:36:28 But big corps need their tax cuts to buy back their stocks. I'm sure they'll understand (sarcasm with side of vomit)  What Trump and the GOP congress has done is immoral and they know it
53 2018-01-08 23:36:02 This is just one of the hundreds of examples that when grouped together give businesses and investors confidence. If anything I’ve understated the impact. $7 trillion in new wealth generated in stocks alone.

62 2018-01-08 23:30:57 It's obvious to me he is saying that the stock market, as usual, is only helping the RICH. The poor in our great country are not benifiting from this boom. They don't own stocks and don't get dividends.
63 2018-01-08 23:30:25 I thought you mentioned in a previous tweet that you would steer clear of medical marijuana stocks? Why the turn of face

66 2018-01-08 23:27:26 Great read, you should check “How to trade in Stocks” also by Jesse Livermore and is the lesser famous book that was published 1940 after the one you mentioned

72 2018-01-08 23:24:24 There is still risk/reward but u have to watch stocks for a while before u invest.  Read bout it. It’s not a game u can just pick up and do unless u have about 25-50k of expendable money u don’t care u might lose.  Watch the market, watch a few stocks.  Buy and sell.  B smart
73 2018-01-08 23:23:28 i hope you have some rainbow stocks in there

75 2018-01-08 23:22:54 Depends what type of information ur looking for.  I’m decent with what I know.  My buddy could steer u in the right direction.  Don’t just go in.  And buy.  U need to watch stocks, see when they are at a alltime low or low within the last 6 months.  Buy, than sell once they go up
76 2018-01-08 23:22:51 o3o I should learn to build stocks

78 2018-01-08 23:21:11 As far as the FTSE 100 is concerned, it's simly a feature of the fall in the pound, that makes all stocks priced in pounds apparently cost more to buy.

88 2018-01-08 23:16:08 I’m not middle class but I damn sure have invested in my future. Started with my first job 33 years ago. I put 5.00 a week towards stocks. Every time I got a raise I upped the amount. I started at 6.87 an hour. I didn’t live outside of my means. Priorities.
89 2018-01-08 23:15:36 I've been using acorns for over a year now. It's amazing! I'm in Australia so the stocks and the fluctuations of them would be different but I'm always up by the end of the month.  The spare change feature when you spend money is the best saving tool.

95 2018-01-08 23:13:47 What a wild guess that was! The tax bill?!?! The tax bill was just signed and hasn't even gone into effect yet. Geez. And so how about regulations? How do regulations (also not entirely in effect yet) affect supply & demand to make the value of stocks go up?

101 2018-01-08 23:11:13 I look for bullish stocks closing over 13ema intra day on volume, or I look at the daily charts and use 13ema/50ema crosses/supports etc use those to guide you on entrys/exits, make sure the r/r on trade fits your portfolio. @SpartanTrading goes over all this take his class.

110 2018-01-08 23:06:23 I also find it disturbing and it disgusts me when Trump and friends say “but the stock market is doing so well”, but I don’t own stocks! Wages aren’t rising, they are stagnant , so let’s talk the “wage market” for a change!
111 2018-01-08 23:05:48 “Most people don’t own stocks”. Why? Literally anyone can own stocks.

121 2018-01-08 23:00:35 Actually if you objectively look at the numbers during Obama’s term you’ll see trumps numbers don’t match up. The stock market only for higher becuz trump is making the fed buy up stocks. There will be a major correction.
122 2018-01-08 23:00:00 FTSE Futures have held the previous day's low for 10 days in a row. The run has extended to 11 days only twice in at least 21 years, most recently on 16 May 2017, 165 trading days ago (when the run lasted for 12 days) #stocks

125 2018-01-08 22:59:21 Ok wallstreet numbers and stocks is not aan accurate measurement of how our country is really doing financially
126 2018-01-08 22:59:05 Never got ill and have eaten shellfish in your supposed bad areas for years, don't believe in your testing of the waters , seems like an attempt to have holiday makers leave stocks alone
127 2018-01-08 22:58:27 2. Eg, a young worker borrows 100k and invests it in stocks and hold it for thirty years. Or contributes to a 401k over thirty years. Obviously, total returns will be highly impacted by when contributions were highest. In former case, worker is "time diversified."

135 2018-01-08 22:54:37 It’s about staying invested. What good is the theoretical return from an all-equity port if a down year causes you to sell out? Of course stocks outperform over the long haul but psychologically some can’t handle it.
136 2018-01-08 22:52:56 Fast Money is having a serious discussion about the effects of the flourishing pot industry on fast food stocks. I'm already loving 2018.

140 2018-01-08 22:51:27 The DOW is not the e ink y and the economy is not the DOW. Corporations are buying their own stocks. No new jobs there. Don't con us!

152 2018-01-08 22:43:46 Stocks are part of the old financial system, they can suspend them all 
153 2018-01-08 22:43:38 It's gonna be worse than a "recession"... This so called Tax Reform coupled with companies buying their own stocks and the soon to come Bank deregulations and Years of printed dollars flooding the country hasn't shown it's full Inflation yet. DEPRESSION-YUGE-BIGLEY

156 2018-01-08 22:42:14 @realDonaldTrump What stocks would you buy, if you were poor like me?
157 2018-01-08 22:42:03 ..have a knack in picking stocks. thing is 6/10 success rate I hope is good but, playing options one got to be right in direction and within a timeframe, both of which can be very tricky at times as are markets times are pretty wicked volatility 1 day to next.

168 2018-01-08 22:36:59 Would y’all be more interested in learning about stocks if I set up a cheap membership program? $39.99min-$440max (length of the membership)
169 2018-01-08 22:36:43 I like LUTH-AR, they just sent me an Email this morning that they're sending a MBA-1 stock for our AR project. I've had two of those, great fixed length stocks.
170 2018-01-08 22:35:11 IMO, best to buy stocks for what they are, and not get caught up in the Crypto space....
171 2018-01-08 22:34:03 The lady noted that once when BTC crashed FAANNG stocks went  down as well. What a statistically valid argument.
If anything one notes, that BTC IS NOT correlated to the stock markets.

176 2018-01-08 22:33:19 I can say the same exact thing about you. The only difference is, you'll be saying the same things even when you're making more money at work, your 401k and stocks rise, and Trump is draining the swamp in Washington DC.
177 2018-01-08 22:33:16 Buy stocks in a tyre company. Each set wouldn't last long..
178 2018-01-08 22:33:14 Also, a bull market is not a bubble. People confuse the two. Bull markets usually end in bubbles. But stocks are miles away from that right now. You can't have a bubble if no one is in it.
179 2018-01-08 22:33:00 83% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population. Yet our media tell us to celebrate a high stock market ? ? ? ?
180 2018-01-08 22:32:33 This man I would walk miles to see in stocks.
181 2018-01-08 22:32:32 Ha! I'm the furthest thing from a "permabull." We're in a secular bull market but I have never said that stocks can't fall. Just see 1981-2000 for clues. In Jan/Feb 2016, for instance, small caps fell over 12%. It will happen again. We're long overdue for a pullback.
182 2018-01-08 22:32:14 $WEED.CA still best in breed but getting up there in valuation.other pot stocks with more upside imo. Full write up on others in link in bio

191 2018-01-08 22:27:40 Hey @WorldAndScience don't you know that almost all aquarium fish are wild caught--30 million annually--which depletes critical coral reef stocks?
192 2018-01-08 22:27:39 I wanna see H&M stocks lol.
193 2018-01-08 22:26:09 For a coin that has real use market cap shouldn't be a measuring stick. We are talking currency not stocks. If xrp goes main stream supply of xrp will go way down easily which will cause the price to sky rocket
194 2018-01-08 22:25:47 Buying stocks is like going to a discount store and buying the nicest pen you can for a low price. You analyze the quality, value, uniqueness of the pen. First lesson of what to pay for a stock? Is it worth the price? It’s about price, earnings, value, and great if discounted.
195 2018-01-08 22:23:12 Wow. Guess we should ALL give thanks to our “Dear Leader!”
196 2018-01-08 22:23:11 Just When You Thought H&M’s Stocks Couldn’t Drop Further

200 2018-01-08 22:22:19 no one has data from the future, it doesnt exist yet.  yes I know earnings are projected to grow.  aside from recessions, they always do.  that doesnt mean stocks cant be expensive.
201 2018-01-08 22:22:03 Nope!
202 2018-01-08 22:21:42 What the best way to find some of the stocks to swing is it too look for what’s moving or scanner
203 2018-01-08 22:20:43 As of 2017 9% of Americans own 84% of stocks that are pubically traded in the United States(The monetary assets ratio is similar).
204 2018-01-08 22:20:21 Yup...I was in both $MYSZ and $NSPR so I am pretty happy about it. Feels good after all the OT as a hospital RN last fall to finally have trading accounts for stocks, cryptocurrency, forex, etc. beefed up enough to not work OT as a nurse now.
205 2018-01-08 22:19:41 But America has been working, Dow soaring to its highest level while stocks has put smiles on Americans faces. Wolff is a lowlife
206 2018-01-08 22:19:18 Thanks for great charts , how do you scan for stocks that have retraced or are they just part of the 1200 you look at weekly mentioned on your interview
207 2018-01-08 22:19:01 Or people schematically drawing out charts " guys this is where it's headed " and are always 100% incorrect because this isn't the same as stocks  " Oh guys a bullish run is incoming we're going to "x" sats " and nothing moves or dwindles
208 2018-01-08 22:18:52 You’re just sad nobody’s gonna but shit stocks anymore lmao

211 2018-01-08 22:16:29 Been thinking about doing Ripple for a few months now and today I decided to do it. Just gotta wait for my transfer to come from the stocks and it’s a go.

219 2018-01-08 22:13:45 1. Reg changes have huge initial cost and can actually be detrimental, especially to small business.              2. An arbitrary metric.  3.&4. Mere BS words w/o data to backup. 5. It's because the corps are buying back the stocks. Which is not good for the average American.
220 2018-01-08 22:12:10 This was DOA anyway - coal stocks don't care. Seaborne met & thermal on fire and natty is about to move above $3

230 2018-01-08 22:06:55 Be sure to talk about the electoral college and the election alot, everyone loves that.  Oh, and the stock market too, ignore that whole-50%-of-Americans-own-no-stocks fact.  

And make sure to perpetuate the myth that the estate tax affects all farmers.  
#TraitorTrump
231 2018-01-08 22:06:53 Maybe they should, then they would be able to get excited when stocks go up. Plus, saving for retirement instead of hoping that SS holds out. That's a win-win. They can even fund the acct with their tax savings.

236 2018-01-08 22:04:53 Yup, diversification is wise and those three stocks are going to be huge! Good luck!
237 2018-01-08 22:04:01 All you need now are a bunch of armed men (w/bump stocks) heading to public lands, along with their lawyers. Sheesh! Didn't they learn from the incompetent Oregon prosecutors?
238 2018-01-08 22:03:20 We get our inspiration from the #trumphaters, blinded by the fact that you didn't get what you wanted; cry babies . Unemployment very low, ISIS destroyed, stocks soaring, more money in our pockets, military, police and boarder patrol ALL standing up for Trump. #youstartcaring
239 2018-01-08 22:02:39 Ummm..Wall street is not really the economy at all time high..because stocks have fallen after bubbles in the past. Judges, many unqualified have been appointed because there are many vacancies...any body could have filled those positions, look how many people have quit or fired

246 2018-01-08 21:59:32 As if Walmart doesn’t have a duvet? What is this?! The store that stocks kayaks but no duvets!
247 2018-01-08 21:58:54 I saw a sign at the BA F lounge and took note and will definitely use. I just thought it was amazing how the stocks went to zero on so many brands. And some pax were stockpiling like it was Xmas (£6000 of La Mer for Xmas gifts right in front of me!).
248 2018-01-08 21:57:30 NP, I gotta remember to get a screenshot of the monitor tab one of these days again for you guys. I know we’ve been stopped out of 3 or 4 stocks along the way. We got knocked out of a utility a couple weeks back. But otherwise we are pretty much on cruise control. Bull market: 
249 2018-01-08 21:57:11 1:1 entry point projection charts in stock trading can give an idea of a stocks relative price within a structured trading system of calculus e.g. Spreadsheet #SystemsAnalysts

Growth stocks & Crypto/Blockchain lagging $BLOK (-3.4%) on c. 950k shares; $RHT (-1.8%) on 900k shares
$LOTO looks strong @ 30 cents (+11%) on 2.5M shares
251 2018-01-08 21:54:58 Had a down day with my #stocks, but only lost 0.03, so it wasn’t a bad down day by any means. Especially if tomorrow is one of those 0.20+ bounce-backs like I had on Friday! And should be buying more stock by the end of the week! #investing
252 2018-01-08 21:54:08 If I dye my hair purple, blame stocks 
253 2018-01-08 21:53:47 Your stocks weee doing good long before Trump took office. Obama took the market from 8,000 back to 20,000. You won’t see the actual impact Trump has on the economy for 2-3 years into his presidency. He barely passed his first economic policy. His wagon goes str8 to fed. prison
254 2018-01-08 21:53:38 Who says I don’t own stocks in it  but agree with you.  I think my main gripe is that developers should really focus on expanding their library for VR to make it really mainstream
255 2018-01-08 21:53:02 Most of trump supports dont even invest in stocks or bonds

263 2018-01-08 21:46:52 Josh Jackson is averaging 18/6/3 with 2.2 stocks per 36 minutes over the last 10 games. Finally on his way? He has made 9-20 threes during that stretch, so still will need to make jump shots to succeed.
264 2018-01-08 21:46:10 10% of the population own 80% of the stocks. Clearly the wealthiest Americans are your highest priority.
265 2018-01-08 21:45:40 Stocks have risen in nine of the first ten months of the Trump Administration, a record that no other U.S. president can match.
266 2018-01-08 21:44:22 Weed stocks didn't exist 10 years ago...

271 2018-01-08 21:41:24 Right.
I schedule activities that don't require creativity, like clearing all of the emails that are probably not of interest out of my inbox, or passing fly stocks, for those hours after an afternoon class.
Don't worry. You'll be brilliant again tomorrow.

275 2018-01-08 21:38:51 Past midday, MBS slightly lower, off worst levels. Stocks modestly higher. 10-yr yield 2.48%.
276 2018-01-08 21:38:00 Hollywood  will not tank their brands or stocks. Millions of dollars verses actual humans who were raped & assaulted? Millions win.  Actions speak louder than all their empty words.  It's a dog & pony show with a bad actors.

287 2018-01-08 21:33:36 I do think Trump will ultimately do more than most think he will do. How it influences pot stocks is yet to be seen. So far, they are taking the news relatively well. That could change after a raid or two.

351 2018-01-08 21:10:51 The stock market has been climbing for 8 years straight, and yes its up 25% this year, but its less than the rally in we had in 2013.  That is simply a fact.

410 2018-01-08 20:42:01 give you credit for at least being able to contemplate "languish" but stocks like this go up until the fans discover where the growth stops, inevitably short of the most optimistic expectations and valuations crash and down comes baby,cradle and all
411 2018-01-08 20:41:20 I would be with you if I would not hate those management fees, individual stocks for now ...
412 2018-01-08 20:41:17 Given #GoldenAge, "January effect," expected good year for economy and stock market, positive international developments, etc., then this should not only be a good month for US stocks, but one of the best ever.
413 2018-01-08 20:41:17 Not sure that I can recommend a specific stock. I’ve gone with a portfolio because I don’t know which one will be the next winner.... for me I would look at stocks that haven’t had huge runs, but even that could be wrong....

419 2018-01-08 20:40:14 Eventually, it is going to get crazy up in here.  Value is quite high, price is still pretty low.
420 2018-01-08 20:39:49 Well I invested some money into stocks today and created a investment portfolio #AdultingToTheMax
421 2018-01-08 20:39:37 Yes, but US retail investors have not been piling into stocks.  They, commercial banks & public pensions have been biggest marginal buyers of UST's in recent yrs.

424 2018-01-08 20:39:21 My philosophy with stocks and real estate is buy and hold.
425 2018-01-08 20:38:40 Not from your benefit! How many americans own stocks? Think alot about that and how the market economy really works before speaking up like this. It is not your work it is the work of the obama administration.
426 2018-01-08 20:37:48 Investment banks aren’t hiring me and it’s their loss because I’m up $87 on crypto currency. Goodluck with your caveman stocks and bonds. SHEEESH
427 2018-01-08 20:36:21 One wonders if we have a melt up in stocks, Gold and BTC/Alts all at once in 2018 before the music stops.  Setup still possible.  Bonds 
428 2018-01-08 20:36:10 Instead of socks he gave you stocks? I am actually laughing so much, I hope they're worth 18 grand each 5 years from now
429 2018-01-08 20:35:53 nope. I didn't had stocks when Enror and the financial crisis...
however, I have an investment right now with XRP and CoinMarketCap fucked my inversion with market manipulation.
430 2018-01-08 20:35:50 @todd_harrison Seeing several Cannabis stocks breaking to new highs today, Should be very bullish to shake off the Sessions' announcement, and continue to rally. Are you seeing that on a widespread basis.
431 2018-01-08 20:35:43 Thanks for your counsel on these two stocks and your advice to stay patient. The $FAT has indeed hit the fire.
432 2018-01-08 20:35:37 About to participate last year and couldn't. Then TMAX, then whatever followed; failed the Summer party. On all my favorite stocks, could not make it.

433 2018-01-08 20:35:23 Love the color of the desk. I had to custom build mine, 8ft desk for three monitors and a big tv for stocks I watch so I can trade while I stream. I still need to get me a nice mic tho.

435 2018-01-08 20:34:38 I saw you on techbuds and decided to fallow you based on your ANDI call .... I don’t know why my scanner didn’t pick ANDI or FRVD or other high % penny stocks  any advice ? Thank you 
436 2018-01-08 20:34:20 This is what we now call radical transparency. BRK bottomed the day the NASDAQ peaked, and rose while it crashed (as did many old-economy stocks.)

441 2018-01-08 20:31:53 Publicly owned companies taking their tax breaks and buying their stocks back. Not hiring, not giving employees raises. Entrenching their CEOs and their bonuses. Surprised? Not me.

444 2018-01-08 20:31:13 I agree there’s no real regulatory oversight needed for the base coins (Bitcoin, Ether, etc). It’s all open source and online. But tokens traded on Ethereum are more like stocks and bonds; the underlying assets are opaque without disclosure.

454 2018-01-08 20:27:34 Per Wall Street financial analysts so far:
1. Stocks are all over-valued because of massive tax cuts.
2. Companies and investors have stockpiles in cash.
3. Will create consolidation and job cuts.

462 2018-01-08 20:23:16 Makes sense #DGB is fast and you need fast for retail. I guess if people pay with #BTC they have to pick up their stuff in two to three days. Typical time for Bitcoin to clear
463 2018-01-08 20:23:10 Same here, just started trading the stock market @CNBCClosingBell because of my interest in cryptocurrency. Trying to learn all I can, so I can hedge with some stocks, & incorporate some risk management.

473 2018-01-08 20:19:21 I personally would never lose under this tax cut. I will even get more dividends from my stocks (the companies have already said so). But I'd rather pay my bills that hand more of the bulk of this money to the 1%.

493 2018-01-08 20:10:52 "If stocks underperform 2013’s gain, the five-year return will fall and so may the pace of buying by investors."  I struggle with the relationship between the two.  Why would investors buy less based on what happened in 2013?

519 2018-01-08 19:58:14 @CarlHeastie - In the wake of the horrible shooting in Las Vegas last year, we will take up legislation to ban bump stocks in NY
520 2018-01-08 19:57:25 How about doing something more than praying? What ever happened to getting bump stocks off the market? Why would anybody need a silencer or a flash suppressor? How is allowing people with mental problems access to guns going to change anything?
521 2018-01-08 19:57:11 Haha he said sorry! What’s all the fuss about then?!
Maybe that was King Eric’s problem, he didnt, instead he said he wished he decked him harder!
522 2018-01-08 19:57:08 @CarlHeastie - Lax gun laws are the reason handguns, bump stocks and military-grade assault rifles are crossing state lines and finding their way into NY. We must take action as a state to curb this deadly pipeline

546 2018-01-08 19:46:09 Not saying this is overly bearish (because it's not), but a lot of the stocks that have spiked past few days like $BABA $PYPL, $NFLX, $NVDA haven't hit new relative performance (RP) peaks. Let's see if they can do so in the days/weeks ahead to confirm their strength.

603 2018-01-08 19:21:49 Very confident.  Take for example stocks.  Perception of growth is driving price, but in reality growth doesn't exist.  Just p/e expansion led by leverage.    Same applies to the entire spectrum of crypto.  Perception of value although zero exists.

626 2018-01-08 19:07:45 For stocks to produce attractive returns, earnings growth will be a key factor in 2018. Better global growth, a pickup in business spending, and lower corporate taxes should all support better earnings

628 2018-01-08 19:05:23 I don't think there are any *shoulds* with penny stocks. It *could* be $10. yes. It hit $8 already and the next spike will likely be $12-$16... but the street looks at posted Qtr reports and the one that will push it to $20 will be for Q1 - May 2018.

637 2018-01-08 19:01:47 I think high circulation supply cushions the price action of $dgb  for micro payment transactions. A more stabilized price movement would be ideal for the project and #dgb 's roadmap. That's why #digibyte is for the long hold because it will slowly crawl it's way up.

639 2018-01-08 19:01:08 Obama passed no law that has caused the past year to be booming . One , stocks skyrocketed on Election Day when trump won and 2 , they jumped again on Inauguration Day . Only a complete moron would think that was just coincidence .

674 2018-01-08 18:48:50 Yesterday I put $8 in stocks cause I was bored and now I have $48 #blessup

677 2018-01-08 18:48:28 I’ve learned to not check my stocks because that shit gives me anxiety
678 2018-01-08 18:48:27 Don't you have some automatic weapons, with bump stocks, to sell to a future mass murderer?
679 2018-01-08 18:48:09 The economy is up@stocks up@and 2mlion new jobs
680 2018-01-08 18:48:05 Rather take a whack from that than have some one gob on me! Disgusting pal. 6 games not enough!
681 2018-01-08 18:47:40 DTEC is an #ETF that just started last week. ( I do own )  I like the theme & the 10 top holdings are #stocks that have been great #growth companies. This ETF is putting fresh money to work. History is on the side of this type of #investment #investing #money

683 2018-01-08 18:46:42 A fair thing to want, you’ll have the Hull vs Lincoln game to look forward to 
684 2018-01-08 18:46:38 I see typical liberal ‘appeal to emotion’, but no actual argument. How does it weaken our economy? You must be referring to their presence suppressing wages so your stocks provide a higher dividend.
685 2018-01-08 18:46:20 It also accepts Gulden you too think it's superb? :D People just tend to love what they choose to buy. It's money nothing more. no need to love and be blind.
686 2018-01-08 18:45:58 Better they die in their own homeland.  We are getting whiter and better and stronger is why the stocks market is doing so good under President Trump.

689 2018-01-08 18:44:59 dgb have nothing new in it.  2-3 years ago it's good stuff - now it's old age technology. I own DGB and a lot i would say 40% my portfolio, but still it's nothing special its just good coin, cause good people behind it. But it's not revolutionary.
690 2018-01-08 18:44:23 The first U.S marijuana ETF Stocks went live couple weeks ago. Go invest.
691 2018-01-08 18:43:47 Cryptos down stocks up
692 2018-01-08 18:43:30 Hey @FifeFlyers, and news on how @Stocks_68 is after that hit last night? Key player, need him back in the line ASAP. #COYF
693 2018-01-08 18:42:23 Eating in the lunchroom is always a treat. One table of significantly older men are talking stocks and one table of people all around my age are talking beer pong and I’m eating my hot pocket alone scrolling through Twitter #winning

695 2018-01-08 18:42:05 Juhuuuu, today #Osram #stocks at record high close to 79 Euro. Great development!
696 2018-01-08 18:42:05 Thanks for getting back to us and good choice of cream,    The perfume is lovely - but it is a limited edition so it's only whilst stocks last!
697 2018-01-08 18:41:45 In todays world, veganism is a lofty goal and one reserved for the affluent. The reality is the additional cost of the logistics required to ship vegan only dietary stocks across the globe have and would continue to increase carbon equivalency, environmental impacts.
698 2018-01-08 18:39:57 A lot of people keep mentioning that profits from $SX will probably pour into other stocks...  My profits are staying right where they are and I’m on the bid for more lol. Don’t look at where a stock has moved from but rather where it’s probably going. 
699 2018-01-08 18:39:42 Global stock rally cools as Wall Street slips
 
Dollar finds support to rise up off lows and Europe’s stocks stay positive
700 2018-01-08 18:39:38 Does it never occur to them that they're treating it like a stock, not a currency? That if they're so gung-ho on investments, they can gift *actual* stocks?
701 2018-01-08 18:39:13 Woah! My stocks are up 62 cents! Money moves!
702 2018-01-08 18:38:23 I hate selling stocks .. but I got mad bills skrap
703 2018-01-08 18:37:56 That's gonna be one rich store in 6M time
704 2018-01-08 18:37:43 Unfortunately, nothing you do now can make up for your support of the tax GIVEAWAY to the wealthiest Americans. You supported TAKING from working families and giving to the rich, so they can buy back stocks to make their corperations more valuable. Shame on you Senator Collins.
705 2018-01-08 18:37:29 I now pay less taxes, the Bundys are free, Hillary Clinton is finally under real investigation, unemployment is down, stocks are up, we have a Conservative Supreme Court, North Korea is meeting with South Korea, and Democrats are unhinged; pinch me, is this WINNING?
706 2018-01-08 18:36:51 Some one needs to program these AI machine learning algos to play tic-tac-toe for a while before they resume stocks.
707 2018-01-08 18:36:41 @highlowly1 yep, any money I put in crypto I assumed it was going to -100% or +1000s% 
hodl or stick with stocks
708 2018-01-08 18:36:16 il en reste peut être sur la billetterie, après sur place il y aura forcément des stocks donc tu devrais en avoir
709 2018-01-08 18:36:14 I'm dong a lot of stocks here @billboard
710 2018-01-08 18:35:59 Michael you are really drinking the kool -aid sorry not buying pres 45 is better in any way tax reform if your rich or can afford to buy stocks or have a company health plan you love him remember over 51% didn’t vote for him
711 2018-01-08 18:34:51 generally konse stocks me options lete ho Sood saab
712 2018-01-08 18:33:17 Come on John let’s DO something. How about extreme vetting before buying a gun? How about no bump stocks. Anything!
713 2018-01-08 18:31:55 Trump really wants to take credit for stocks being up, but honestly anything good to happen the past year or so has come from private industry.
714 2018-01-08 18:31:44 we're doing shots for stocks to give them a chance :^)
715 2018-01-08 18:31:36 Don’t call it a comeback! #markets #stocks $GM
716 2018-01-08 18:31:10 Shiller PE  notches another new high, now 33.31. But we are not in a bubble and stocks are cheap at these levels.
717 2018-01-08 18:30:58 What about the ppl who don’t own, and never hope to own, stocks?  They don’t count in your opinion, either?  They sure don’t in Trump’s, that’s apparent.
718 2018-01-08 18:30:55 Yay my store now stocks way more vegan options!
719 2018-01-08 18:30:51 On dull days, I'd transfer DGBs from my Core wallet to Coinomi just for the heck of it. Because they r so cheap n fast. It shd be *the* crypto worldwide.
720 2018-01-08 18:30:41 You're insane. Unless you own stocks or make over $500k a year, the economy is stagnant. 63% of Americans couldn't survive a $500 emergency. Job growth dropped first time since Obama and the trade defecit is bigger. Facts are facts.
721 2018-01-08 18:30:12 UK spending at a 5y low.
Consumer spending down 0.3% last year - worst showing since 2012, according to Visa. British shoppers face higher inflation, weak wage growth and #Brexit uncertainty.

Within Europe, we continue to prefer EU vs. UK stocks.

725 2018-01-08 18:29:11 Next ??
726 2018-01-08 18:28:58 Love me some $DGB
727 2018-01-08 18:28:42 Still companies like Genus Paper etc left near single digit / low double digit surely will do good even some paper stocks which didn't do that well earlier
728 2018-01-08 18:28:06 TCF doesn't seem to apply to some providers (and a number of 3rd party administrators).

E.g. some 'life consolidators' frequently feel that the clients signature can't be verified so ID required.

Or they make a cock up but their rework goes to back of the 6 week queue.... again
729 2018-01-08 18:28:03 Thinking  about investment or stocks back then like am now ass a grown ass man my mind was on woman and living my life when my mind should of been on those books hell that's what I most regret shit got me ranting like this on this motherfucker.I'm get my life  in order and I dare
730 2018-01-08 18:27:50 what truth? That he is a failed business man?
Trump doesnt invest much in stocks, he's a developer, a very successful one
731 2018-01-08 18:27:23 Oprah or C Booker, what difference does it make! A Nomination either way will be a spectacle alone. Stocks will plummet for sure.
732 2018-01-08 18:27:20 Stocks moving higher now as the rally continues. Led by tech $NVDA $TSLA
733 2018-01-08 18:25:57 $GPRO bounce
734 2018-01-08 18:25:42 Slowly, I'm hearing more commercials for trading and finance help per break, every day.

Today it begins to sound a bit like, "Buy stocks! Please!? We'll do it for you!! Anyone besides 10% of the wealthiest. Please, we're trying to correlate the stock market with average people!
735 2018-01-08 18:25:34 We don't forecast. We just observe without bias and react. #stocks #investing

737 2018-01-08 18:22:59 So basically the same as what went on since the financial crash of 2008:

Stocks over-valued due to excess liquidity injected post 2009
Companies had stockpiles in cash, used for share buybacks
Created consolidation, particularly in health care & financial sectors, and job cuts.
738 2018-01-08 18:22:24 Hi, I have few questions regarding your service, what’s the best mode to contact you, thx
739 2018-01-08 18:22:04 We explained the short term idea about #Technology stocks and how can we trade $AAPL & $MSFT as $XLK is reaching our target  #Elliottwave
740 2018-01-08 18:22:02 Great question, but even a better question is, how much stock do the CEO's CFO's own over their own companies?
Its great that stocks are soaring, but if they only people who are gaining wealth is the people who basically own the company......
741 2018-01-08 18:21:47 COMMON QUESTION I get asked in DM.....How to play momo's

I use RSI as a good guide for playing momo stocks. If RSI is above 80 to 85, I think twice about jumping into the stock..... same if I am in the stock, once it hits 80 to 85 RSI, I look to sell some shares on the first dip
742 2018-01-08 18:21:39 ... call recording policy documented, templates expected to be used, admin checklist seeks to validate phone call templates being used... Though actual recording (i.e. not just as a written note) not required due to our exempt status.
743 2018-01-08 18:20:47 @vladstocks where's the best place to buy stocks vlad? Listened to ur interview with edi. U never mentioned it. Still think ur missing something nt trading cryptos.
744 2018-01-08 18:20:31 I think it's best to get in, triple your investment, sell half and let the rest ride while you rinse and repeat on other stocks. Never fall in love with a stock.
745 2018-01-08 18:20:12 Why use stock market terms to explain Cryptocurrencies? Stocks never disrupted anything #crypto #BTC $BTC
746 2018-01-08 18:20:07 Thanks Meegan and CBC, for the wonderful opportunity to talk about my book and hope it can be of benefit to anyone wishing to build their financial security. #stocks #wealth
747 2018-01-08 18:17:43 Ur name itself says it all about ur anguish , keep investing in great thoughts n great stocks ....
748 2018-01-08 18:17:31 Out until the dip is over and show some consistency
749 2018-01-08 18:17:02 Shout out to sessions for the dip on the weed stocks lol.
750 2018-01-08 18:15:53 Je ne vois pas pourquoi. Les "stocks" sont encore relativement peu importants. Il ne faut pas non plus tomber dans l'excès inverse des gens qui prétendent que, même si la population d'origine européenne devient minoritaire en l'espace de 3 générations, ça ne pose aucun problème.

762 2018-01-08 18:08:59 My money and banking class is in the Naval Sciences building. Catch me on cruiseliners trading stocks 
763 2018-01-08 18:08:58 That is a lot of money that will need to leave other stocks.
764 2018-01-08 18:08:38 Thank you for nothing the purpose behind our actions. If I was just “in it for the money” I could be a shady weed dealer, or find a way to buy (also shady) medical marijuana pot stocks. But no. For me, it’s about seeing success for our cause, for the people... The purpose. 
765 2018-01-08 18:08:18 Oprah vs. Trump? I think Media and comedy stocks are still a great buy!
766 2018-01-08 18:07:21 But if you were smart, you would know that argument would be beating a dead horse. The stocks were hanging on a thread from bush.
767 2018-01-08 18:07:16 And what have you done to help working class people? We can't buy stocks or save money, we need living wage.
768 2018-01-08 18:07:05 Start of the year and most of y'all have already became laughing stocks.

770 2018-01-08 18:06:48 As for me I never liked/trusted Obama from first time I laid eyes on him. He is a racist Cop hating BLM Loving closet Muslim. Why is the Dem Congress insisting on doing nothing but the same old failed crap? Obstruct Resist what? Jobs Stocks Strong Defense?
771 2018-01-08 18:03:59 @SullyCNBC You've gotta talk about the aggregation of stocks by global central banks and governments... this isn't only about "buybacks".
772 2018-01-08 18:03:50 You still r failing to do anything as well for working poor. We can't buy stocks. Increase wages n get votes
773 2018-01-08 18:03:50 How ? Umemployment down . More jobs and my stocks are higher then ever .. please explain this

790 2018-01-08 17:57:52 Bix, love your videos! Why do u compare cryptos to stocks when talking about tax events. Stocks have to be converted back to USD (sold) THEN another stock is purchased with USD. This is how the IRS, in my view, operates. Cryptos are TRADED for Cryptos with no USD involvement.
791 2018-01-08 17:57:03 ...and investing in trees is not really insurable. Costs of fire, pest etc. is 2 or 3%, so there is no point. Instead, you manage the risk: clean plantations so fire doesn’t take hold as example. And, always plant more trees than you harvest: 3:1 perhaps.
792 2018-01-08 17:56:55 Of course, but I can see #dgb growing to around 5-10 usd in 2 years

810 2018-01-08 17:50:40 You know who can afford stocks, the rich. Keep telling your inner circle that your plans will make them rich and watch who knocks on your back door some day. Militias aren’t dead.

817 2018-01-08 17:48:52 Your job numbers were lower than Obama's you fucking walnut. Also 50% of the country has no stocks at all, and cannot buy them as they live paycheck to paycheck. Not like you ran on defending the forgotten man though so keep forgetting them lil guy.
818 2018-01-08 17:48:52 Here’s the problem: Richest 10% hold 80% of stocks. Most Americans do not benefit.

826 2018-01-08 17:46:09 Go and ask them how many ppl already paid with $dgb
827 2018-01-08 17:46:03 It actually does not matter that much. But the reason probably is that they want to make it easier for people (maybe,first time users) to estimate the price. For example, 100dgb=10usd is much more comprehensive than 10usd=0.0006667btc
828 2018-01-08 17:45:01 Bonds are indeed the biggest bubble.  However, ridiculously low bond rates are the foundation for the extreme pricing in ALL other assets including stocks, art, real estate, cryptos, commodities, etc.  If bond market cracks, all others will eventually follow.

888 2018-01-08 17:25:13 You do realize that less than 50% of the working class own stocks in the market and over 30% of the stocks are owned by foreign nationals/corporations.  I thought you said you were a financial genius.

893 2018-01-08 17:23:57 And it's the adjusted average of only 30 stocks, at that. I'm pretty sure some of the people being the most vociferous abut the DJIA on twitter aren't grasping how little the it actually impacts most investors.
894 2018-01-08 17:23:49 As an investor, you are not compelled to buy everything. Buy where downside is low and upside is good. Having long list of 500 stocks like Shatiranand is futile coz most stocks don't make money over long term.

937 2018-01-08 17:08:21 Really depends on where your 401k has it's money invested. The DOW is NOT all the stocks and 401k's are diversified (if they are smart) so they don't have all their investments in the DOW. Companies have their 401k with different investment firms. Success DEPENDS on THEIR choices
938 2018-01-08 17:07:30 I love how people praise @realDonaldTrump for the high stock market value, but 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of America. You know who benefits from the stock market? Them. Not you. Don’t let 45 fool you. He cares about HIS money and the money of his friends.
939 2018-01-08 17:07:28 You think telecommunication stocks are over priced in SA, especially those two?
940 2018-01-08 17:07:07 To all your incompetent followers... Stocks are mostly owned by the richest people. They take their earnings and reinvest in the market. It doesn't effect the 80% who don't own stock in any way. That means he's lying, just like always.

1031 2018-01-08 16:34:57 Well said. Takes a bit of an ego check for some to only focus on a few stocks, but it's paramount. Newer options traders want to play everything, and that mindset is rarely beneficial.

1049 2018-01-08 16:29:54 I’m sure your 401k has performed quite well this year and dating back to March of ‘09. If you only started to see that portfolio grow this year, well then that’s on you. But the strength, or weakness, of our economy is not defined by 30 stocks tracked in a price weighted index.

1083 2018-01-08 16:15:30 That’s what the tax cut did- how’s that lake house con man
1084 2018-01-08 16:13:50 Truth is our President is ending corruption, bringing jobs, making us safer, stocks up, and military strong and ridding us of failed o care.  Your right Oprah the truth sets you free.  What up with Weinstein???
1085 2018-01-08 16:13:46 how are your stocks doing ? $$$$
1086 2018-01-08 16:13:39 pero ang stocks juy problem 
1087 2018-01-08 16:12:36 Anyone have some free stocks I can have for headers? 
1088 2018-01-08 16:12:36 Chill man. It will be announced. This is kinda what stocks do. It was crazy high then consolidated - wouldn’t call it a disaster.
1089 2018-01-08 16:12:26 Thanks, Mike. I did some "soul searching" over the weekend and am changing the way I do things. Still have all my stocks but am watching a lot less and options a lot more; message boards at a minimum, too.
1090 2018-01-08 16:11:40 This guy here is incredible for our economy in America! People finally getting back to work, getting tax cuts, and stocks going up (more money in people’s 401k plans). So glad there is finally a president who knows what he is doing! Thank you Mr. #POTUS #Trump
1091 2018-01-08 16:11:18 1/4: One of the things I trade is forex. But is it easier to generate long term profits from stocks than from forex? I think so. Stocks are designed to only go up. It doesn't always work that way, I know. But the whole point of a company is to make money and grow, and gain value.
1092 2018-01-08 16:11:09 If I’m left alone for too long I end up doing weird shit like buying stocks someone help
1093 2018-01-08 16:10:15 I'm good...just thinking about nuclear buttons, not watching the golden globes, and investing in marijuana penny stocks
1094 2018-01-08 16:09:54 Miller is a GREAT DEBATER dealing in facts, not gossip which Dems use. Dems hatred is self destructive. Accept Trump as our President & lowest unemployment in 17 yr, Best GDP in 8 years, Record stocks & 401ks, lowest taxes. Just starting
1095 2018-01-08 16:09:49 3/4 Also, stocks can only go to zero. A relationship between two currencies can move a lot further than anyone's bankroll can last. There is no zeo. Some angry people are going to respond by bragging about the oodles of money they've made trading forex. Congratulations to you.
1096 2018-01-08 16:09:39 Holding Delta Corp,Tips Industries, TVS Electronics & Indraprastha Gas in my portfolio apart from usual top ones.
Do you like these stocks ???
Should I sell them ???
1097 2018-01-08 16:09:15 Stocks are up because your tax cuts and business deals have made them more money. No proof of job creation just wealth for big business. #happyblueyear2018

Yet I remain long-term profitable on stocks. And that's what I'm talking about (back to tweet 1/4). Long term profitability.

1115 2018-01-08 16:02:18 Facts the economy was doing quite well before trump ever came along. Facts less than 30% of Americans are investing In stocks or wall st.  So he’s not really helping the working class. Facts trumps jobs numbers are still not better than Obama’s.
1116 2018-01-08 16:02:10 Cryptos have more noobs than penny stocks. There are entire groups of them on FB who are clueless. But I'll take their shares and money if they are so desperate to give them away.

1122 2018-01-08 16:00:05 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.

1125 2018-01-08 15:58:33 Or stockpiling.  Or bump stocks.  Or the administration  blowing  off all of these mass murders because whites (or l black guy) from America did them.. They're saying nothing because NRA owns them. Passed a concealed law right after that.  Guns r fine but more rules. 3 total.
1126 2018-01-08 15:58:18 Many folks are now becoming cautious and that is GREAT.

In this market, one should look for turnarounds and well-managed stocks that have not participated in the rally. Avoid overpriced stocks.
1127 2018-01-08 15:57:54 Great news for the rich who actually buy stocks, too bad for the poor who can't afford to invest.

1135 2018-01-08 15:55:22 The "old" pensions from corporate America were invested in stocks and many smaller pension programs from higher education are invested heavily in the stock market. Many are gone. The best pensions are federal/state which tend to act like trusts. Social Security is a good example.

1144 2018-01-08 15:53:07 the insurance industry lost about $95 billion to five disasters in 2017, I would say that could mean a rougher market and higher prices for re-insurance, a potential good thing for insurance stocks this year.. $BRK.B being a big winner on top of tax reform.

1154 2018-01-08 15:49:12 Learning about stocks can be a bit complicating
1155 2018-01-08 15:49:08 Here's our #MondayMorning Observations - @DowJones rose to 25,295.87 (2.3% gain), $SPX at 2,743.15 (2.6% gain), @NASDAQ at 7,136.56 (3.4% gain). The last time stocks rose for 4 consecutive days was in 2010.  #stocks #MarketUpdate @ap
1156 2018-01-08 15:48:56 I'm convinced that stocks and crypto are 100% gambling. You can't control what the market does more than you can control where a roulette ball will land. The key to success is placing yourself in the situations with high probability of profit. Right place, right time.
1157 2018-01-08 15:48:44 A measure of current output is always relevant. Stocks of wealth not being cultivated in supply and demand chains do not move the gears of an Economy. Let's add new measures while continuing to improve #GDP.
1158 2018-01-08 15:48:34 But it’s a sort of ridiculous isn’t it? Taking LSE or NYSE out of the calculation for any stocks traded there would drop its market cap by a cent. But it shows XRP quotes don’t seem to be real - you can’t sell at the published quote.
1159 2018-01-08 15:47:38 one really simple trick I use for long term hodling is keeping them outside of exchange wallets and event from my blockfolio, out of sight out of mind :D So even if I want to panic sell it would take some time and meanwhile I come to my senses

1161 2018-01-08 15:47:01 OMG President Trump is % mentally fit. It is obvious this is a hit job from the left. But this too will backfire.

But now that Trump is here and black unemployment is at historic low of 6.8% and stocks are soaring from dereg and tax-cut expectations, we gotta kill it."

1247 2018-01-08 15:18:39 All these crypto experts remind me of Tokyo Joe during the late 90s.  I used to go to his taco spot in midtown and watch him pump and dump internet stocks ... until he got pimp slapped.  The players, faces and products are new, the strategy, not so much.

Learning from your posts and support.
Thank you
1354 2018-01-08 14:47:53 @BobPisani What about lack of stock splits as a reason for less stocks? Use to be common practice, price >$100, split it.
1355 2018-01-08 14:47:04 totally agree on marketing. It looks like a webhosting website from 2009 era and it also made me feel skeptical when I first started digging about #DGB .
1356 2018-01-08 14:47:01 I've been working so hard on a plan to catch retracing stocks; it worked on $TSLA on Friday, but lately, these $AMZN $FB $NVDA stocks have just been trying my patience- straight up!
1357 2018-01-08 14:46:56 @SmallTalkDaily Top Stocks of 2017; returned +17.5%   versus 0.7% for JSE small cap & 7.1% for mid cap indices. Any pathetic smart arse comments ? @JSE_School_Bus @bshamley @Ryk_van_Niekerk
1358 2018-01-08 14:46:56 Actually I see the market is open but it’s not showing my % gains for my stocks right now. Only my Days gain.
1359 2018-01-08 14:45:59 I think the supporters should call @MizunoPh and @BootcampFTBLSHP to inquire about the stocks of @FCMeralcoManila shirts and I hope that they are available for sale.

It should serve as a remembrance for a great club that departed too soon.

1363 2018-01-08 14:43:38 Not with companies selling back their stocks to falsely drive up prices. It's all an illusion. Besides, the top 1% own 84% of stocks. Ask B. Madoff said the stock market is "a game stacked against everyone". Wait til the market crashes, & it will! You'll go down in flames!

1369 2018-01-08 14:42:13 Lots of stocks gaining today for me. Glad i got out of the 2 or 3 stocks and spread my eggs into smaller holdings but more companies. Spreaded my risk and I can see the rewards much better with the portfolio looking alot healthier.

1377 2018-01-08 14:40:16 AT&Ts, Pfizer, Carrier, Macy's and many more are thanking Trump for the break and laying off 1000s of ppl. The CEOs of these big companies are not hiding the fact they're using the big tax break to buy back stocks. Btw...cutting regs that weaken Consumer Protection is not cool.
1378 2018-01-08 14:40:15 today is feeling like a real monday.  Reminds me of an old book with the name don't sell stocks on monday.

1402 2018-01-08 14:31:38 Your trade deficit has widened more under Trump than under Obama. Your stock market is surging bc rich ppl are buying up stocks. CEOs buy back company stocks bc most of their pensions are based on price of their stock. Consumers feel confident due to this. AT&Ts

1405 2018-01-08 14:31:18 Given the growth of stocks recently, investors may inadvertently be overweight in equities and could be exposed to greater volatility than they may realize. Pay close attention to your asset allocation. #FreeAdvice #Rebalance
1406 2018-01-08 14:30:49 The only existing evidence that President Trump is "crazy" is that he was willing to give up an amazing, fantastic life in order for him and his family to be bombarded 24/7 by vile assholes who aren't fit to even lick his boots.

He loves us and our country THAT much.

1414 2018-01-08 14:25:56 #donthecon has brought a new level of corruption to the WH. ONE example. He pumps coal stocks. Guys on his committee bring a Coal company public and within a short time pay themselves 50% div before coal stocks start plummeting.
1415 2018-01-08 14:25:36 I don't want to call you thick Donald - But CEO's remuneration package is partly determined by the rise in their companies stocks, so they buy their own stocks, which then rise, they are partly paid in stocks & so increases CEO pay; money is diverted from R&D & future profits!

I'm only interested in stocks that have great fundamentals and huge upside.

1429 2018-01-08 14:20:41 People do own 401k and SOME of those have stocks.  That is a good thing.  Thanks Obama for a 7 year upward trend.  But job growth is DOWN this year and that hits real AMERICANS harder than hitting arbitrary market points.

1474 2018-01-08 14:00:57 Where have you been? Trump & supporters HAVE often talked about how wages are & will increase. But Stocks are related to 401K’s & IRA’s which are important. Rich would be a poor advisor to a President.

1506 2018-01-08 13:51:45 Where are they coming from? Do you still live around here yourself? Are you looking in a particular area not in SE London?
1507 2018-01-08 13:51:37 @RobinhoodApp I’d love to see the ability for me to add “notes” to my stocks. A way to keep track of my personal buy/sell points.
1508 2018-01-08 13:51:36 An excellent way to diversify,  stay with well-known Brands, but reduce exposure to the over-weightings of the FAANG stocks in the S&P 500, which have extremely high P/Es right now.
1509 2018-01-08 13:51:23 $CLNT is now $SEII? Guys what are you thinking? Now you cant get pumped on the "buy chinese stocks with a c in the ticker" secular growth trend.
1510 2018-01-08 13:51:22 economic growth like this has actually been seen before numerous times, and just because the stock market is up, doesn't mean jobs are at an all-time high.   The stock market highs primarily benefit the rich shareholders who own many stocks, not the middle class.
1511 2018-01-08 13:51:20 i love this 
1512 2018-01-08 13:50:16 I love watching the liberally blind whining going on here. Where’s my popcorn? My stocks are soaring, millions of folks going back to work, business is booming, isis getting squashed. A President who loves America and has cojones to stand up instead of bow down to the world. MAGA
1513 2018-01-08 13:49:51 I have no idea which stocks I wanna trade this morning
1514 2018-01-08 13:49:09 Obviously you’re one of the elites, high returns from stocks while lowering taxes for the first time in decades have left no impression. Regulations cut 20 -1 and jobs jobs jobs, I guess that is something to be depressed about though. Your gardner & nanny will cost more.
1515 2018-01-08 13:48:39 I love your stock info but please Mr, Kass stick with stocks..

1522 2018-01-08 13:46:37 Also in the third quarter, households and nonprofits held 36.3% of their money in stocks, the second-highest rate ever. The only time this peak was topped occurred in the first quarter of 2000, during the peak of the dot-com bubble, when stockholdings reached 42% of total assets.
1523 2018-01-08 13:46:34 Not being a hater or anything at all. Just curious if you were shorting stocks that climbed a decent amount in a short period of time? In a bear market I'm sure we won't be getting 80% gappers, 200% runners on the reg. Idk your strategy but just a thought
1524 2018-01-08 13:45:59 What stocks will benefit the most?
1525 2018-01-08 13:45:52 It’s a falsely inflated top heavy wave... same as 29, 87, 99, 01-07.  A market that thinks it’s stocks height will create it’s own engine.
1526 2018-01-08 13:44:40 Sir is there any correlation between time correction in housing finance stocks and your time away from TV interviews.
I am sure many people would love to hear your views on the housing finance sector now.
1527 2018-01-08 13:44:02 And the rich get richer. For all those Americans who don't own stocks or have 401k's, it doesn't mean squat. But of course, those Americans don't matter to you. Wait til your base figures this out...

1535 2018-01-08 13:39:30 Ecopetrol and YPF were the best-performing stocks in our coverage in 2017. But the MSCI Energy index underperformed the broader market by a wide margin, despite rising oil prices (+19%). Can the oil and gas sector win over investors in 2018?
1536 2018-01-08 13:39:29 #PRINCIPALMF @rndx1 there is all time low volatility in stocks around the world it will get tested in 2018

1540 2018-01-08 13:38:51 We’ll never agree on this topic! Maybe Wolves will sign him next year and I’ll admit you were right. 
1541 2018-01-08 13:38:07 Stocks just had a huge week and investors excited about more stock buybacks following tax reform. I'll discuss that and Apple iPhone addiction fears with @maggielake on @cnni at 9am ET.

1553 2018-01-08 13:35:45 You know, you get to hear nonsense at this stage of a cycle. CAPE is nonsense, the bond market is stupid, valuations are reasonable, stocks represent underlying businesses, bear markets don't do much damage.

1565 2018-01-08 13:31:51 If you agree to that concept then you must avoid Hospital stocks 1st. Tobacco companies say that their product is harmful but corporate hospitals are killing people and charging for that. Indirectly many pharma and healthcare stocks also would fall in that basket. JMHO

1574 2018-01-08 13:29:32 When trading it is important to be observant of the market evidence. When buying you must buy at higher prices. It is asinine to buy at a lower price because the evidence is the market is going against you. #Trading #Forex #Stocks

How do you think a trade war w/ China or NAFTA tear-up will do for ‘Trump rally’ in stocks?”
1610 2018-01-08 13:13:57 The scam goes: Teach them enough to know riches can be made. Make sure you emphasise that losses are a reality. Let them know you can trade on their behalf too. Steal their money and say the market ate it. #Trading #Forex #Stocks

1657 2018-01-08 12:56:05 Conservative investors usually look at stocks with good dividends, bonds, treasuries, time deposits. Stocks give more yield (but are riskier). When treasuries and dividends' yields are almost =,  investors may transfer to treasuries to lower risk w/o sacrificing much income.

1841 2018-01-08 10:57:51 So many have missed the rally in these stocks by overdue correction as per yours, it's easy to predict as stocks have run up so much, that's why investing in strong fundamental stocks won't hurt much when markets are to go down, meanwhile enjoy the bull run.

1853 2018-01-08 10:52:14 That's been the case for the last so many months isn't it, has it changed? correction can come and stocks can go down but the growth momentum all over the world is such that the corrections are not lasting long and they have been bought in to.

2224 2018-01-08 05:31:20 People buy these stocks because of reported and projected profit. Profit is maximized by keeping the money in the system, not by meting it to those who do the grunt work.
2225 2018-01-08 05:31:01 Stock values have continued to go up, even after #DumbDon was elected – but that only really helps those who are wealthy enough to own stocks. Real wages have risen at extremely slow rates. There is no evidence of jobs (much less "jobs, jobs, jobs") and wealth divisions grow.

2237 2018-01-08 05:23:15 Yes. Earnings reports and forecasts are important catalysts. If a corporation can post record profits (which they do by taking advantage of job insecurity and price increases), the stock rises with these indicators as demand for these stocks increase.

2263 2018-01-08 04:56:28 Some stocks you can buy a warrant that someone is selling on the open market. Check out $emc I know that have warrants that trade. But normally you get one if you partake in a private placement
2264 2018-01-08 04:56:16 Only 10% of us hold significant investments in stocks.

Those rich assholes will all cash out and transfer overseas now that you've made it cheaper to do so.

2267 2018-01-08 04:54:52 Glad to hear man. And I do appreciate your vote of confidence.... also glad you are picking your own stocks based on the opinions that you have formed. 
2268 2018-01-08 04:54:38 Don't know if you understand stocks but % wise the DOW over the last 10 years, 2017 was only the 4th best year.  If you were actually into stocks, you might realize it's the percentage increase that matters.  Then again, you probably don't know stocks.

2281 2018-01-08 04:50:02 The rise in stock prices began under Obama in '09. The rise in 2017 was not unique, & mirrored a global rise in equities. US stocks have NOT rallied as robustly as foreign ones. FALSE CLAIM!

2292 2018-01-08 04:43:50 My case is exactly opposite, the stocks wait for my sell and Zoom to highs eventually reaching ATH. I held many for years when no action was seen and my sell triggered a breakout.
2293 2018-01-08 04:43:25 Interestingly the portfolio with 50 stocks has a bigger Drawdown than the one with 40. Usually, one’d expect the diversification to kick in.
2294 2018-01-08 04:42:23 Look at the PE ratio. That alone will do all the talking. With stocks, bonds and real estate in a bubble, only someone with rose coloured glasses would predict no chance of a crash.

2342 2018-01-08 04:16:22 The top 20% of Americans own 92% of stocks. That leaves 8% for the other 80%. This milestone helps very few people see real gains.

2353 2018-01-08 04:11:32 That translates into value, not liquid assets or tax revenue. Per se. Stocks are not products that create jobs or material demand.
2354 2018-01-08 04:11:27 The problem is laymen are seeing it as stock.

You dont by half a stock. You buy 1 stock, so because they are stuck in an old way of thinking they do not purchase fractions. 

That being said any amount you put in will grow because it is NOT stocks. You CAN own a fraction.
2355 2018-01-08 04:11:20 Why are you using stocks and not salary growth as proof? Oh that’s right.

2389 2018-01-08 03:53:42 I think the Rs are a bit tone deaf in regards to their praising of stock market gains to Trump supporters in Ark. So few own stocks. & the VAST majority of the gains are to a very small % of Americans at top. How does that help them? Methinks it’s not a winning argument for them.
2390 2018-01-08 03:52:18 Not even taking up the legality of bump stocks. He's busy self-promoting.

2395 2018-01-08 03:48:24 @realDonaldTrump the wall isnt what you want to build. It will.just stagnate tge southwest states economy that is more than 50% supported by Mexico today. Its best to build factories instead playing gambling in.stocks.

2397 2018-01-08 03:46:32 Most working Americans don't own stocks. Those are for the rich. Working Americans want paying jobs and despite @POTUS and companies claiming jobs, the reality is Americans continue to lose jobs because it cheaper to pay a Chinese worker 10 cents an hour a d ship those to the US.
2398 2018-01-08 03:46:19 The market is manipulated by people on Wall Street yet y’all keep investing in 3rd party stocks

2402 2018-01-08 03:44:41 Stocks only matter for the rich and you know it. You don't know much but you know that. Obama had to fight tooth and nail to get anything done because of racism. All you do is make sure you get credit, so don't freaking even drag him into this, you vulnerable & pitiful man.

2421 2018-01-08 03:42:21 That and real math.  Dan missed that 85% of stocks are the upper 10%.  Most of Trump's base own no stock and have little to no savings. They got screwed.
2422 2018-01-08 03:42:16 Very true. What’s surprising is that even the high PE stocks have slightly outperformed the market. Probably mid-PE stocks underperformed. So one has to choose the sides, there is no place in stock market for fence sitters !!

2492 2018-01-08 02:56:36 Thanks. I am also switching to ETF's this year...too much time is spent on monitoring and reading about stocks.
2493 2018-01-08 02:55:55 None of the old media stocks have had a very good go of it lately. Do you believe CBS’s slide is a referendum by the market that selling terrestrial radio assets was a bad idea?
2494 2018-01-08 02:55:13 how many called does everyone who trades stocks get about crypto a week? even my friends pretend to call me about something else then really want to talk about all this bitcoin crypto nonsense I'm thinking of some sort of formulated response ?!
2495 2018-01-08 02:54:50 Really depends on where your 401k has it's money invested. The DOW is NOT all the stocks and 401k's are diversified (if they are smart) so they don't have all their investments in the DOW.
2496 2018-01-08 02:54:21 I’ve made a fortune in the Trump stock market, and even my energy stocks are starting to soar now. It’s too bad your don’t have any money to invest yourself. I’m sorry you’re doing so poorly in life.
2497 2018-01-08 02:54:20 You spelled wages wrong. Also you you didn’t focus on wages. Also. Can you please focus on wages. We can’t buy stock unless we get a raise. Please represent the 50%+ of Americans who can’t afford stocks. It’s kinda your job.
2498 2018-01-08 02:54:19 I can’t keep up, way too many stocks, not enough cash
2499 2018-01-08 02:54:08 No i have a full time IT job and trading stocks is just a hobby, but they didn't even look at that. All they look at is penny stocks, frequency of trading and how successful you are.
2500 2018-01-08 02:53:50 84% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of Americans. When are you going to do anything for anyone who isn’t already rich?

2505 2018-01-08 02:52:59 Poor people and many middle class people don’t have the expendable income to buy stocks. This doesn’t mean a good economy overall. Job growth is slower than it has been in 6 years.
2506 2018-01-08 02:52:24 It is a trend following momentum product which has a portfolio of 40 stocks and where we churn (if any) once a month. Over a period of 12months usually no more than 12-15 stocks change in the portfolio. 40% stocks may result in a LTCG. More details if can send email.
2507 2018-01-08 02:52:24 For the rich. Everyone does not own stocks. You are a disgrace
2508 2018-01-08 02:52:09 Time will tell. Either way that has nothing to do with the stock market that Vlad keeps pointing at. The one that unless he has stocks in means almost nothing to him or the rest of us.
2509 2018-01-08 02:52:07 55% of Americans have no stock. How does it help them? Oh and the market is up from the companies buying back their own stocks.
2510 2018-01-08 02:51:34 We do have people here who have to shoot things to survive. Either to keep from becoming food, or to put food on the table, or both. But, hunting weapons and rifles for defending against large predators are a far cry from semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks.

2512 2018-01-08 02:50:08 Please explain to me how the stock market “creates jobs”? You can’t even sell this to your ignorant base since they DON’T own stocks.
2513 2018-01-08 02:49:44 Stocks that have ramped, (some with out me), that need to pause to allow an appropriate low risk buy. @TickerMonkey 
2514 2018-01-08 02:48:53 You do realize that only about 50% of American's own stocks and most of those are the 1% wealthy type. Not helping average Americans.

2517 2018-01-08 02:47:25 The motto now is to buy the most risky penny stocks and then have the company mention "blockchain" in a disclosure & and make 10x. Rinse and repeat.
2518 2018-01-08 02:46:11 This will happen right after he bans bump stocks
2519 2018-01-08 02:45:51 Yes you should if you flip stocks and/or daytrade in it

2521 2018-01-08 02:45:15 THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT A GAUGE OF THE ECONOMY. 10% of Americans own 90% of stocks and half of Americans have no investment in a 401k or in the stock market.

2524 2018-01-08 02:43:43 Stocks of naphtha in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub rose 13,000 mt, or 4.4%, to 311,000 mt in the week ended Wednesday, PJK data showed.
2525 2018-01-08 02:43:24 On this thread? Wrong topic but we can talk about Dow. I'm sure you have 401k, are you loving how the stocks are doing?
2526 2018-01-08 02:43:17 Thank you Pat.  I appreciate you taking the time to do these videos and sharing your tips.  I am learning a lot from you, and I'm enjoying spending time finding #stocks myself, rather than just following someone else's stock picks during the trading day. #study
2527 2018-01-08 02:42:40 “Dead Cat Bounce” is to stocks

2528 2018-01-08 02:42:26 What about people who can't afford stocks??? That's your main concern all the time... The stock market. Who's losing losing billions, you and your offspring??
2529 2018-01-08 02:42:07 Paper profits that flow to the 2% that own 80% of all stocks. Low paying jobs, you’re a fraud, & everyone knows it! Turn off your TV and get some help. #ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
2530 2018-01-08 02:41:54 Then why the need for bump stocks? You could get out of control with semi auto and not hit your target. Sights off and you hit something other than target. Police do it all the time. Didn’t think this through did you?

Real estate 4. #yourself This last investment option might sound cheesy, but it’s one of the best investments anyone can make. By investing in yourself, you are improving the biggest asset you’ll ever have
2544 2018-01-08 02:34:19 For pandemic influenza preparedness specifically, SNS holds stocks of antivirals drugs in SMI intended to be used to treat ill individuals.  SNS currently holds stocks of zanamivir (trade name: Relenza) and various formulations of oseltamivir (trade name: Tamiflu).
2545 2018-01-08 02:33:24 Wonder how the Pot stocks will open this week ??? #moneyonmymind
2546 2018-01-08 02:32:40 Agreed. @peterschweizer wrote a book about Congress making millions each on insider trading for stocks and secret land deals and not wanting the information made public before he wrote #ClintonCash. One of the few things both parties in Congress can agree on!
2547 2018-01-08 02:32:34 10% of Americans own 80% of the stock market. What would do you live in you stable genius???? If you know stocks, you would know that it's 35% overpriced and a crash is gonna come soon.
2548 2018-01-08 02:32:34 Don’t have time to read it. Too busy watching my stocks go higher each day and my taxes go down.
2549 2018-01-08 02:32:32 Yep. Haha. Di siya stocks. 
2550 2018-01-08 02:32:05 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 8,785.61 up 15.61 points or 0.18 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2551 2018-01-08 02:31:33 Comcast stock went up... AT&T stock went up... both got YUGE tax breaks, and both announce YUGE lay-offs! Please tell me who is hiring as a result of your tax bill! Asking for a friend, cuz he doesn't have a computer or stocks, and would lover to leave Wal-Mart for a better job.
2552 2018-01-08 02:31:31 I have a similar strategy but I use the e-series index funds..I do weekly contributions...but I also invest in a few drips through transfer agents bank stocks. Congrats man time is money
2553 2018-01-08 02:30:25 That's a good vibe ~ My stocks are on the up and up :D
2554 2018-01-08 02:29:50 Research team decides the methodology and criteria, but doesn't pick individual stocks. The idea is to ensure theme fit by giving the list of stocks qualifying the criteria without any personal bias. Users are free to customize/create their smallcases (2/2)
2555 2018-01-08 02:29:41 Market looks much higher triggered by those who missed market last year waiting a correction and strength in foreign markets. Buy growth. Energy stocks look higher
2556 2018-01-08 02:29:30 Any thoughts or picks on these stocks? $GRCK $INMG $OCSY $ILUS $PDXP $HPNN
2557 2018-01-08 02:29:16 Your understanding of smallcase is not correct. It is not an investment advisory/recommendation platform. smallcase is a portfolio of stocks based on a particular criteria/theme. If the stock fulfills the criteria and methodology, it becomes a part of the smallcase (1/2)
2558 2018-01-08 02:27:36 Paul Nehlen's #ShallNotCensor would be the first step forward from this backwards landslide but we would still need to rebuild the entire system from the ground up. It should have been done in the first month of his presidency and pumping stocks shouldn't have even made top 100.
2559 2018-01-08 02:27:12 And , "the Kirk's thank you Mr President!"

2564 2018-01-08 02:24:28 Futures opened strong but Nasdaq futures have been slowly dropping and now almost red. Would be interesting to see if tech stocks open red how quickly they will get bought.

2566 2018-01-08 02:24:13 Yes. Most stocks doing as they should so far. I thinking we see a takeover or 2 as well.
2567 2018-01-08 02:23:30 Since 5% of the population own 90% of the stocks president Liar is correct saying the rich just got a lot richer.
2568 2018-01-08 02:23:23 Stocks don't mean ANYTHING to MOST Americans because they can't afford them.  The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks and MOST Americans DO NOT have employers who give them a 401k.  JOB, JOB, JOB growth is the LOWEST in seven years.  I will send you the chart.  #MAGA
2569 2018-01-08 02:21:39 if you do a few trades a day with penny stocks and are successful you will be a target.
2570 2018-01-08 02:21:30 When I buy soap I'm not trying to increase the $ in my bank. However, I do think about that as I buy crypto and I buy stocks.

2574 2018-01-08 02:18:47 Stocks don't help those who aren't invested. And it's not the economy. Learns some basic economics jackass.
2575 2018-01-08 02:18:42 More than half Americans are scared of stocks.
2576 2018-01-08 02:18:40 One thing that is very probable in the budget is radical bank reforms.

If this proves true, operators may create a scenario that makes traders short bank stocks.

It may be prudent to latch on to bank nifty at lower levels, after panic has set in -- IF THIS SCENARIO PLAYS OUT
2577 2018-01-08 02:18:31 okay show me 2.2 cents at least waiting for some of my stocks to move is a sleepy
2578 2018-01-08 02:17:38 The UCP stocks were full so I’ll bet Active is fairly close by The ‘19 wear-out date. ANG may be another story.
2579 2018-01-08 02:16:19 Please view my previous tweets displaying my success trading penny stocks. Achieved using TA. Everyone has their own style! And every style doesn’t work for everyone
2580 2018-01-08 02:15:57 So? No really, so why is that important? If 50% of Americans invest in stocks, that means that they are gambling on capitalism and the creation of more jobs. What’s wrong with that?
2581 2018-01-08 02:15:41 I love hearing that stocks like $RTM $FAT and $SX are over pumped and nothing is there. Makes me feel good inside

2585 2018-01-08 02:13:53 According to the street smart guys like Rick Rule, institutions aren't touching the gold stocks until it shows them something. Until they show sign of life. I think gold has to be $1400 or maybe even $1500 before they get in .

2588 2018-01-08 02:12:09 Charts won't help you with penny stocks. An understanding of human psychology will, though.

2594 2018-01-08 02:08:09 Any retirement program is effectively a 401K program. Money is invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. to grow the overall program.
2595 2018-01-08 02:06:42 At this point in time, given the massive cash gift to corporations from the “tax plan,” the price of stocks is partially reflecting a premium that investors think corporations will pay for stock buybacks. At least partially a bubble.
2596 2018-01-08 02:06:33 20% cagr is possible in Indian contest as compounding takes effect after 5 years of holding these stocks any one year sudden spike can take it beyond 25% as well. Anyway expect this to be better than any other investment avenue

BUT - Profit in human svcs. (health/edu) must be balanced. That's broken ->

2613 2018-01-08 01:58:13 Their is so much buying pressure in certain silver stocks it's crazy...
2614 2018-01-08 01:58:09 By “value created,” be clear: you mean the stock market, which is 80% invested in by the rich. Most Americans don’t own stocks. Jobs growth in Dec. 2017 was the slowest in 6 years.

2617 2018-01-08 01:56:29 My picks are not a buy or sell recommendations. I do dd on stocks and then present them on Twitter or stockhouse . As always the only dd that counts is your own. Yes I like to make the little guys money. But it's not saying I am right on everything I buy either
2618 2018-01-08 01:56:16 @WhiteHouse See. It's Logic. Filling The CCC Currencies Global. With Derivatives Money & Stocks. Enlarging Increasing. Quantities & Values.
2619 2018-01-08 01:56:03 Right. Most people do not own stocks. And for those who do, the bubble will burst also.
2620 2018-01-08 01:55:57 Every year around the holidays I think of that one time @todrick said he stocks up on Vanilla Bean Noel and I wonder if he still does that 
2621 2018-01-08 01:55:30 Peny stocks? Bitch please, shitcoins for the win.
2622 2018-01-08 01:55:23 Um, do you think your base has stocks - or even knows what they are?   Oh, right, it’s just your super fucking rich friends.
2623 2018-01-08 01:54:14 It would be so good  if for once The Australian reported the facts responsibly rather than promoting fear and panic for the sole purpose of leveraging Conservative stocks in the upcoming Vic election.
2624 2018-01-08 01:53:16 All Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge Bubble, ready to pop anytime. Too much Federal, State & Local Govt Debt, Student Debt, Sub Prime Debt, Consumer Debt - Mother of All Debts will burst the economy anytime very soon. A 30% correction for Stocks coming w devastating effect to all. Beware!
2625 2018-01-08 01:52:54 The top 1 percent gets almost all this benefit. 50% of Americans own no stocks. This stock market growth does very little to help the working class voters who elected you.
2626 2018-01-08 01:52:20 The average PE ratio for companies on the S&P 500 is 32. It hasn't been that high since October of 1929. Stocks are seriously overvalued. Protect your IRA and 401(k).
2627 2018-01-08 01:51:54 Ethereum houses thousands of decentralized app tokens. Yes, like stocks, many will be worthless. But some will become highly used applications giving the token great value. Intrinsic value greater than 0? I think yes.

2629 2018-01-08 01:51:23 Where do I even begin? I don’t have much to spend to begin with. I’ve bought a few penny stocks but mostly lost on them a few dollars here and there, so I’ve been investing longer term stocks. Financial freedom would be incredible, mostly to pay off debt and  to travel!
2630 2018-01-08 01:51:08 Compare that to let’s say s and p stocks or big names in market and can’t imagine its any diff if at all.

2636 2018-01-08 01:43:50 Yep ,its kind of sad to see poor ,low income Americans cheering for the stock market because  they believe it means they will be better off . Reality is it has no impact on their life what so ever. Stocks go up millionaires make money,not you.

2641 2018-01-08 01:40:34 got my slow and steady stocks as diversification/insurance. Whatever happens, happens lol
2642 2018-01-08 01:40:15 Vote for: best performance stocks this week:
2643 2018-01-08 01:39:44 Your supporters don’t have stocks
2644 2018-01-08 01:39:40 Is this a serious?
2645 2018-01-08 01:39:02 Living in Racine is your Fail
2646 2018-01-08 01:38:08 You sent your errand boy out and he couldn’t answer the questions.  How’s the approval rating. Remember, top 10% of Americans own 80% of stocks. That is who is grinning from tax break
2647 2018-01-08 01:37:53 Kroger always stocks to the neighborhood...  and even though I have gone to several in the Western KY area, none carry them...
2648 2018-01-08 01:36:40 @WhiteHouse CCC Is The Future Finances Monetary Systems Globally. CCC Incorporate Derivatives Money Stocks. Into It's Intrinsics Values.
2649 2018-01-08 01:36:20 Cut the bullshit with the “stunning admission”. We know the Fed doesn’t sell the VIX or buy stocks. Why do you even propagate this crap? It won’t fix having been wrong for the past 8 years. And nothing will fix Grant’s monetary policy analysis.
2650 2018-01-08 01:34:52 【bond】債券(名詞) He advised them to invest in bonds as well as stocks. #toeic #英語 #英会話
2651 2018-01-08 01:33:49 I’ve been into stocks and crypto longer than you... you know that too. I’ve been in this for awhile. I’m not saying the stock market is 100% going to crash. I’m saying it would before crypto. Look at 2008. Bitcoin was created in 2009 because of the crash...

2653 2018-01-08 01:32:40 *four stocks fox on netplay w/ 20 ping*

"haha ping is too high, ggs"
2654 2018-01-08 01:31:02 And it's the AVERAGE of THIRTY industrial stocks. How could THAT be any real barometer of the TOTAL health of our economy!?
2655 2018-01-08 01:30:38 I’m a ‘working ppl’ and have stocks and savings. I bet you do too.
2656 2018-01-08 01:30:38 The stock market basically benefits only the wealthiest 10% of the population, who own the preponderance of stocks. Most of the rest is tied up in retirement accounts. This bubble will crash when your policies take effect. And your job growth is smaller than Obama's.
2657 2018-01-08 01:30:02 Invested in this green energy nonsense after Obama was first elected.  Windmills, solar, fuel cells, etc. All the stocks were losers! Never invest in a liberal pipe dream, you’ll lose your shirt unless you know which CEO donated to the Democrat pushing the agenda!
2658 2018-01-08 01:29:48 The stock market doesn’t help those that can’t afford stocks. Once again catering to the wealthy
2659 2018-01-08 01:29:42 Generally, for each $1.00 earned in stocks today, somebody lost a dollar. It's the nature of trade deficit.
2660 2018-01-08 01:28:42 Your big election win with the help of the Russians - admit it. I haven’t seen any increase in the job market  and stocks were on their way up anyway no thanks to you. So stop grandstanding at every possible opportunity .
2661 2018-01-08 01:28:31 How many stocks do you own? Do you have a 401k? The majority of the country has neither.
2662 2018-01-08 01:28:21 Most stocks in the U.S. are owned by millionaires. Money flows up, not down.
2663 2018-01-08 01:27:45 @WhiteHouse controlscryptoscash Being Invested Bought In Demand. Of Derivatives Money & Stocks. Creates CCC's Extreme High Intrinsic Values.
2664 2018-01-08 01:26:48 That depends on which stocks, which bonds and which markets invested in. It’s not cookie cutter.
2665 2018-01-08 01:26:47 80% of stocks are owned by 1% of Americans. Congratulations, you’ve accomplished your life-long goal of ingratiating yourself to wealthy elites.  Will you be accepted now? Probably not, since you’re a national embarrassment.  Eternally doomed to tacky noveau riche status.  Sad.
2666 2018-01-08 01:25:11 I had apple stocks before ya knew what stocks were btw
2667 2018-01-08 01:24:32 2018 want to invest more into stocks and crypto

2669 2018-01-08 01:23:15 I would move back to AZ just for the stocks - well, if I get to throw some rocks at these monsters.
2670 2018-01-08 01:21:21 Asian stocks gain following firm US lead as investors await earnings #Forex
2671 2018-01-08 01:20:39 Banks and uncapped lending were the big problem. People lost homes first, the banks defaulted, then the stocks crashed.
2672 2018-01-08 01:20:00 Almost 1/2 the country owns no stocks, no money in pension funds, 401(k) retirement plans, IRAs, mutual funds or ETFs.
2673 2018-01-08 01:19:54 If people invested as much money into the public education system as they did business stocks, the future would be so much brighter
2674 2018-01-08 01:19:51 @777trillionaire would a stock market crash make investors lose confidence in stocks and thus compliment the success of cryptocurrency?
2675 2018-01-08 01:18:17 Ellison is one of the laughing stocks in America!
2676 2018-01-08 01:17:53 Trading stocks is over. Liquidating my IRA. 
2677 2018-01-08 01:17:52 Good morning all friends 
Try your capabilities to put some excess assets funds to stocks markets, it will grows to another unexpected steps. Enjoy the benefits from the US’s present president’s issued right policies.
2678 2018-01-08 01:17:25 Actually, it’s not just tied to stocks, but to the bond. Only 1/2 of Americans are vested in stock market, so it only helps so many.
2679 2018-01-08 01:16:43 So Donnie, do you think the average American with no stocks, struggling to make ends meet, gives a damn that rich people are getting richer?
2680 2018-01-08 01:16:38 no one really knows what’s going on here. I remember solar stocks (everyone including chinese) were skyrocketing for good time and than comes the real puke .
2681 2018-01-08 01:16:19 Nice find on my old chart, it took off from there and I missed it lol! .. Chart looks good at these levels now though, and a lot of lithium stocks have been moving recently .. other than what's in my posts, I don't have any other info - hence why I mainly follow charts!
2682 2018-01-08 01:16:14 When ya'll get those refunds I challege you to invest a portion of it no matter the amount into SOMETHING beneficial. Stocks, your business, a savings account, etc. #WSSU
2683 2018-01-08 01:15:23 Maybe it subtly depends on corr btw stocks and bonds. If stocks  Fed buys bonds to lower rates. If stocks , Fed sells. So are they buying bonds high, selling low? Then short vol. It depends on corr.
2684 2018-01-08 01:14:49 For the rich. Middle and lower class don’t own stocks you sorry excuse for a human
2685 2018-01-08 01:14:39 What if I don't own stocks like the majority of Americans?  All that wealth only benefits you and your rich friends.  You are out of touch with Americans!
2686 2018-01-08 01:14:34 So mas nagmamagaling yung customer sa stocks namin... wag kang ano, bigwasin kita jan e
2687 2018-01-08 01:13:55 50% of Americans own NO stocks. 20% of Americans own 90% of all stocks. Jobs? Job growth in 2017 less than 2016. Stock market growth does not equal job or wage growth. 

What's growing fast? Inequality.
2688 2018-01-08 01:11:37 you need to chat with one of us peasants down here to get an idea of what working ppl r going through no stocks no savings
2689 2018-01-08 01:10:54 That's assuming completely passive income (ie. not owning real estate for rental income, etc. but instead relying 100% on stocks/funds payouts). A wise person can retire younger for much less money and earn in excess of $100K/Yr with minimal "work" required.
2690 2018-01-08 01:08:51 @CNN Stelter and Tapper are the Laughing stocks of the MSM world. You are fueled by hate for a man who has done nothing but great things for this country. Watching Tapper get spanked this morning was like Christmas all over again! Can’t wait for Trump’s Fake News Awards. 
2691 2018-01-08 01:08:22 Not only do the trolls use my name on stockhouse that I am buying stocks I never herd of. Looks like we have another one on Twitter.
2692 2018-01-08 01:08:13 Guess what, i had a job b4 u won, AND my stocks were doing quite well. Thanks Obama!
2693 2018-01-08 01:07:48 It’s to bad only you and your cronies are benefiting from stocks!! If you don’t own stocks it has nothing to do with you...#WakeUpAmerica
2694 2018-01-08 01:06:03 Are tracking stocks still a thing?
2695 2018-01-08 01:06:01 What about bump-stocks that effectively turn semis into rapid fires?
2696 2018-01-08 01:05:40 It certainly has. Made the rich richer. Most middle class and poor don’t own a lot of stocks!
2697 2018-01-08 01:04:19 An xlnt mkt indicator in itself is the size of your watchlist. Mine went from 60 to 91 in a few days #stocks
2698 2018-01-08 01:03:12 Thank you Trump my daughter and son in law both got 15 a hour and 1000 bonus each, along with 800 in stocks and even match 401k

2703 2018-01-08 01:00:50 Panthers played a good game. Just to many field goals early on. Hurt them at the end.  Good season though
2704 2018-01-08 01:00:43 It doesn't even measure profit... profit may play a part of the calculation, but it's just people betting on how the stocks do in the future... Apple doesn't care if I own the stock since they already sold it, and I only care if I can get someone to buy it for more later on.
2705 2018-01-08 01:00:12 Sir we r now working poor ur not helping us ur forgetting us we can't afford stocks or savings b/c wages r low
2706 2018-01-08 00:59:27 Don't u understand most people don't have stocks moron.
2707 2018-01-08 00:59:23 Only 20% or so own stocks, most of us are trying to just keep from freezing to death.
2708 2018-01-08 00:59:17 He always sounds just like a Trumper, really.  All they do is crow about the Stock Market, which only helps 20% of Americans.  But if there's a nuclear war, guess what?  No Stocks!
2709 2018-01-08 00:59:16 my 16 year old sister: yeah I just transferred dad $8000 to put into stocks
me: ?????????????????????????
2710 2018-01-08 00:58:35 How is this helping people who can't afford stocks?
2711 2018-01-08 00:58:22 BITCOIN will drop to 10 k  this week taking stocks down also
2712 2018-01-08 00:57:57 Ethereum +55%, Sify +40%, Capstone Turbine +8.5% all in one week!!! Good week for my stocks
2713 2018-01-08 00:57:21 And con man Trump conned people, who don't even own stocks.
2714 2018-01-08 00:55:03 are you not concerned about the valuation of the pot stocks? Canopy, Aurora appear to be way overvalued, at least if you want to believe the analysts. do you think nameste has still room to run?
2715 2018-01-08 00:51:46 OMG do these Liberal loons ever stop? Let’s see, hmmm, they did a full year of Russian collusion garbage, sprinkled with Hilter, racist, anti everything popular with loons, and now mental stability. Good grief, nothing sticks or works. Except GDP, jobs, stocks & optimism.
2716 2018-01-08 00:50:37 #5YearsAgo Happy na ako na nabibili ko na ang mga gusto ko (like cellphones, gadgets, shoes etc), now I'm more happy buying stocks sa Philippines Stock Market @RX931 #TheMorningRush   more on for retirement purposes
2717 2018-01-08 00:48:58 He doesn’t understand that stock market growth is not an indicator of job growth. He doesn’t understand that the majority of stocks are owned by a small part of the population.
2718 2018-01-08 00:48:56 Money for wealthy people who have $ for stocks. Down South freezing brikenm pipes no heat utilities turning off heat and power. You care about the STOCK MARKET. U and your buddies. Go visit the homeless!!
2719 2018-01-08 00:47:49 Stocks and the stock market are only good for those with stocks.  Most of us will never have stocks. This administration doesn't care about anyone but thier donors.
2720 2018-01-08 00:46:10 you think stocks will decline on jan 19th?
2721 2018-01-08 00:46:02 I have to keep doing this until it sinks in 1929. High stocks everybody getting money until the bubble burst
2722 2018-01-08 00:45:59 Might be my biggest weakness.  As someone who shorts about 95% if the time, I just have this weird belief that these shit stocks will always find a way to go back down.
2723 2018-01-08 00:44:45 Does the fact that the top 10% of the wealthiest who own roughly 80% of all stocks in the US have anything to do with this "landmark" possibly contributing as to why middle class wages remain in relative stagnation?
2724 2018-01-08 00:44:37 “All there is to investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies.”-Warren Buffett
2725 2018-01-08 00:44:08 I have seen so many stocks with bad accounting practices which are recommended. Not a good exercise. Bad accounting practices are not subjective but simply known by all.
2726 2018-01-08 00:44:02 Who can afford stocks?
2727 2018-01-08 00:43:40 Isn't this the " genius" who sold all his stocks for his kids education because the stock market was gonna crash because Trump won? 
2728 2018-01-08 00:43:21 You can never roar to a slay with stocks in Netflix Amazon ....buz
2729 2018-01-08 00:42:26 Agree 100% @EricBalchunas - and now that both the #Canadian $HMLSF and #US-listed $MJX are high-profile, high-volume #ETFs seen as proxies for the nascent #MarijuanaIndustry, must also factor in price-distorting "tail wagging dog" effect of #ETF buys/sells in constituent stocks
2730 2018-01-08 00:42:23 90% of the country derives little or no benefit from the price of stocks. Top 1% benefits greatly, the next 9% to a much lesser extent. If paying your monthly utility bills is a struggle, it’s doubtful you have the $$ to purchase stock.
2731 2018-01-08 00:42:16 Okay guys I’ve had enough of this....need to go back and check my medical marijuana stocks.
2732 2018-01-08 00:41:51 It absolutely does not have a correlation.  Stocks are not evaluated on a dollar for dollar basis.  The stock market going up does not even indicate the companies whos prices are going up are profiting more, much less that any profits would be passed.  Profit goes up not down.
2733 2018-01-08 00:41:10 Dividends
Investors should consider dividend stocks, or funds to seek income in retirement or grow assets. Corporations raking in cash from a lower tax rate, will likely pass some of those gains on to shareholders as higher dividends or special onetime payouts.

2739 2018-01-08 00:39:08 Time to sell all your weed stocks Kam...
2740 2018-01-08 00:37:49 This is the best metric we have to evaluate the total worth of a single cryptocurrency.  The coins have varying levels of utility to justify their price, but lets be honest, the value is *far* more due to speculation - even more so than stocks where at least you own a share.
2741 2018-01-08 00:37:42 In a way I'm thinking a different version of TPP might be an advantage. Our major companies (like GE) are international and just because we have these type companies in Dow and S&P 500, doesn't mean the US directly benefits when stocks go up.
2742 2018-01-08 00:37:37 That $7 Trillion Dollars of Value you keep talking about was realized by the Top 1% & the Big Businesses they own, NOT the average American Citizen. You're talking about Stock Market gains, and the "buy-backs" that the Top 1% are making of THEIR OWN STOCKS, and that helps no one!
2743 2018-01-08 00:37:28 my dad said since you can’t put stocks in marijuana he invests them in the fertilizer instead 
2744 2018-01-08 00:36:50 Thus good time to buy blockchain stocks for the long haul, Hive blockchain being one

2746 2018-01-08 00:35:45 Stocks will arrive tomorrow. (January 9)

Open for reservation! 

Pm me now! for more info and orders!
2747 2018-01-08 00:35:31 The first year of your Presidency has been the weakest job numbers in six years and only 45% of Americans own Stocks, either alone, or in retirement plans.
2748 2018-01-08 00:34:51 To your original point about our President doing too much against Blacks, put aside any political allegiance and consider some of what’s happening for ALL Americans: more jobs; thriving economy; soaring stocks; reduced border crossings; AND all-time low unemployment for Blacks.
2749 2018-01-08 00:34:43 That’s much better news! I constantly feel as if that comment is a slap in the face since most of us don’t own stocks. I prefer your news !
2750 2018-01-08 00:33:27 Its Simple really they don't want to and that's what he depends on . Manufacturing might be at a all time high but if no one buys the stuff it's heading for a crash . Along with the stocks
2751 2018-01-08 00:32:31 Im not or never will be a patron of starbucks but when their stocks dive a lot more after this tweet, I wont be sorry for them.
2752 2018-01-08 00:31:53 Kills me! The people who hate @realDonaldTrump the most are those who believed the media  and sold all their stocks because of the “Armageddon” of a Trump presidency! That idiot Eichenwald is a good example. What a blunder! I am rich today! He who laughs last...
2753 2018-01-08 00:31:07 It ended with "I don't like those stocks!"
2754 2018-01-08 00:30:11 Why APP?
2755 2018-01-08 00:28:14 Guys n girls have been asking me what I'm using for cannabis stocks. Tomorrow's video, we will talk about it!

2757 2018-01-08 00:27:40 Hey stupid. Only wealthy people play the stock market. Majority of America has zero money in stocks. Shocking that you’re pinning everyone’s future on “hoping” companies hire. #trumpisstupid
2758 2018-01-08 00:25:55 I need some info on some good stocks
2759 2018-01-08 00:25:44 Most of your deplorables don't own stocks,the elite demicrats are brneficieres ofvthis. You promised to bring jobs back here. You lied to deplorables and took away their health care subsidies.#FireAndFury #Breitbart #cnn #FoxAndFriends
2760 2018-01-08 00:25:31 Hey.  Back it up.  Why is he the worst? Record stocks, lowest unemployment in years, supercharged economy, tax cuts for everyone, lowest minority unemployment in years, ISIS destroyed.  What exactly has he done wrong you emotion only no fact sock puppet.
2761 2018-01-08 00:25:05 Penny stocks is the vibe
2762 2018-01-08 00:24:43 PENNY STOCKS ANYONE?
2763 2018-01-08 00:23:18 @BobBrinker Have enjoyed jousting with you in the past via twitter but really have come to like your show and look forward to Sunday afternoon now. Was taught what you teach by my parents did not have to sell my time to anyone years ago. Good advice you give, used single stocks.
2764 2018-01-08 00:22:12 Top four marijuana stocks will benefit from Trumps statements last week . Should be a positive for stocks this week. I am prepared . Are you?
2765 2018-01-08 00:22:02 Gus Johnson stocks are WAY up, let's ride this bubble to the bank, baby!
2766 2018-01-08 00:21:55 Yep, i’m holding onto my stocks and hoping for the best.  What else can we do?
2767 2018-01-08 00:21:52 The stocks are up and Wall Street has more of your retirement savings to gamble with. What could possibly go wrong?! #recession #depression #AllOfThisHasHappenedBefore #AllOfThisWillHappenAgain
2768 2018-01-08 00:21:41 I could teach a women about stocks and you would literally watch that woman get Rich.
2769 2018-01-08 00:21:35 I still think @LiberalAus need to make negative gearing apply only to new homes. It was created as an incentive to increase housing stocks. As it stands it is just another tax dodge for the wealthy. #thedrum
2770 2018-01-08 00:20:52 Ahlie and they said here go buy some more Canadian weed stocks
2771 2018-01-08 00:20:29 Will be focusing on Canadian marijuana stocks starting at 5:30 am.  IMO things will begin to heat up very soon. There is no doubt in my mind that Canada will be the right place to focus on .
2772 2018-01-08 00:18:31 Jason, exactly. How does any average American vote Republican? They’ve been shafting the middle class since they started their “Reaganomics” scam. Their latest scam is worse. Cut corporate taxes to drive up stocks. Plus cut estate tax. The looking to create a lasting oligarchy.
2773 2018-01-08 00:18:21 As far as stocks...I started off looking for under-valued gems.  There are hits and misses but you will find them.  Penny stocks starters into a better gain stocks along with the diligence to learn, watch, and do. My advice-it beats playing the lotto. Def not for weak stomachs.
2774 2018-01-08 00:17:38 More than half of America does not OWN stocks you Moron! Dummy! Lol. What a dope you are Blondie!! Please resign!!!
2775 2018-01-08 00:16:41 With DOW J's stocks at 25,000? I don't think so! Oh Russell! Your special needs bus is here!
2776 2018-01-08 00:16:38 Bro you could do anything and people would think it’s the hot new thing. *taking out trash, getting haircut, checking stocks, etc
