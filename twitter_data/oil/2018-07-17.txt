1 2018-07-17 23:59:29 Ooo baby oil may help it not be so harsh hmmm!
2 2018-07-17 23:59:02 Simple but deep: the Mercers & Koch brothers want to drill for Arctic oil as much as Putin does, so they've sided with him, and his 100 years of influence operations in the West.  After that, they'd like to rewrite the Constitution to get out of paying taxes.
3 2018-07-17 23:59:02 Friend recently commented that he thought @RachelNotley and @albertaNDP have been given a crash course in oil and gas industry. I don't disagree. But it is so refreshing that we finally have an #ableg govt that is capable of learning. #UCP seems unlikely to learn from citizens.

5 2018-07-17 23:58:47 The car manufacturers with their billions of profits have great influence over the politicians and dictate the laws. Some Arab oil producing countries are major shareholders of companies like VW.
They are scared of electric vehicles as they threaten their dirty business model!

13 2018-07-17 23:57:23 Day 426 without sex, took a job with an oil company in West Virginia just so I could lay some pipe.

41 2018-07-17 23:54:44 Every meal should have more fat than protein. Mct oil & avocados help a ton to meet your fat macros. Eat plenty of green veggies to prevent gout and/or kidney stones.  Even if your net carbs (carbs - fiber) are <20, but total carbs are at 50, u may still get kicked out of ketosis

43 2018-07-17 23:54:21 Hemp oil is back in stock!! #hempoil After a 4 month waiting period we finally have organic hemp oil rady to be sent out again!
44 2018-07-17 23:54:12 How is NATO stronger a few days after you sold them out to your master, Putin and threw Theresa May & the Queen under the bus? Has Germany stopped buying oil & gas from Russia? No one believes a word you say, including yourself!!!
45 2018-07-17 23:53:52 The intel community hasn't released all the true documents of the kennedy assassination so yeah they can go fuck themselves. STOP INFILTRATING OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE OIL,GOLD,NO CENTRAL BANKS ETC....
46 2018-07-17 23:53:51 i have the beard oil that’s supposed to make my beard smell like a lumber yard but insteadddd it smells like Jack Daniels 
47 2018-07-17 23:53:43 Wait! You mean Trump told Putin that Trump would have "more flexibility after the election"? That Trump would deny defensive weapons to Eastern Europe? That Trump would squash US oil drilling to raise prices?

Oops - maybe I have my presidents mixed up here? Or maybe you do!
48 2018-07-17 23:53:32 The Great Chef continu: Know oil stops brittle. Means fattening. Oven Temp-300 area, 30-40 min.  Also I look at amount or size, then think of how many hamburgers would it need. Im a beef fan.  That is 1 of the best! Thanks. Teach teens bout oil fires. God is greatest! Love,change
49 2018-07-17 23:53:26 I believe Vitamin E can be bad for the heart but what about L-Arginine, nuts and Evening Primrose oil?
50 2018-07-17 23:53:18 U certainly are. Russia has the economy of France. Only thing Putin's got is nukes. We can take them out with our oil and gas. Pres addressed that.
51 2018-07-17 23:53:01 Missing Houston air? I’ll set a barrel of oil on fire for you to re-create that Houston smell until you get reacclimated. Welcome.

56 2018-07-17 23:51:51 Me and grayson use the same extra virgin olive oil bc were both extra virgins 
57 2018-07-17 23:51:39 hey man don’t you know that apple cider vinegar and coconut oil are the answer to everything these days?!
58 2018-07-17 23:51:15 Yes, he had a bad 40 minutes, which he clarified today. Why don't you look at his actions: increased oil/gas production lowering prices that Russia depends on, didn't recognize Crimea, destroyed Russian jets and killed Russian soldiers in Syria and imposed tough sanctions.
59 2018-07-17 23:51:12 Rose Infused Olive Oil is the name of my Gospel Punk band.
60 2018-07-17 23:51:11 And despite having nearly 3 times the output in oil than Texas, Russia's economy is SMALLER than that of Texas.

62 2018-07-17 23:50:46 So on a none game rated topic, @thejessicagraf and all other #BB20 live feed viewers, has anyone heard what Bayleigh's hair care products are? My daughters hair is just like hers and I need new products for her. I know I heard Tea Tree oil was in her spray bottle.
63 2018-07-17 23:50:38 Killed their oil prices? Explain...

65 2018-07-17 23:50:10 You have lot of better things to do  i.e rubbing oil on your head or combing your beards than wasting your time on replying people like that with stupid mentality
66 2018-07-17 23:50:08 But there is something important- Understand 
what it means to be rightly positioned. You 
must have friends in your life who are 
connected to the well.
Friends who when you pinch them, worship 
flows. Friends who drip with the oil of prayer.

70 2018-07-17 23:49:50 Rich in Denmark means something different than it does here.  Because of their government and its control of their oil money, their standard of living across the board is higher.

77 2018-07-17 23:49:26 The Russians are like cockroaches in DC. The towns infested with them. You can’t swing a dead cat without hitting one meeting with some republican. It’s amazing. Could it be their oil money?

85 2018-07-17 23:48:10 Gotta add the oil slowly while blending to emulsify
86 2018-07-17 23:48:08 Like I said I have young girls so even if the chances are 5% I wouldn't bet my grand kids life on what big oil says. I'd bet with science every day. Big energy has done nothing to gain trust but science saves all our lives. Now we are the only country not in Paris agreement
87 2018-07-17 23:48:04 For those of you keeping track at home, here's the updated list of things I've accidently caught on fire:
1) My Pontiac (only a trained professional should add oil)
2) The vent to my dryer (attach power cord to dryer BEFORE plugging in)
3) My grill (investigation pending)

89 2018-07-17 23:47:53 I'm just kidding lol. Once everything is really good and charred you throw it in a blender with bit of water (if needed, sometimes the tomatoes are enough) add salt and a little cider or champagne vinegar, and turn on the blender. Add like a cup of oil while blending

95 2018-07-17 23:46:48 The Great Chef continu: Cover las. with tinfoil, this keeps top layer moist! I put oil around edges of noodles to. There is tomato paste for sale to make a thick or strong sauce. CHEESE has to be thick if you want a strong taste, not on all 4 or layers. And layers means dullusual
96 2018-07-17 23:46:34 Coconut oil >>
97 2018-07-17 23:46:28 Try some organize coconut oil. Does wonders with skin and healing.

106 2018-07-17 23:44:38 What is his view on inflation, rates , oil prices and the economy outlook?
107 2018-07-17 23:44:31 Actions do speak louder than words. Trump dragged his feet implementing sanctions against Russia; he has started trade wars with our allies that benefit Russian oil and gas industry; he shared intelligence with Russia that endangered ally’s asset. Actions all that betrayed US.
108 2018-07-17 23:44:29 all the oil spilling on you

112 2018-07-17 23:44:16 It’s almost 1 am and im still thinking about the fact that a group of boys called me olive oil (zit l’3oud) when they found out I was Moroccan. The pick up lines Moroccan men use are unmatched, 11/10 for creativity I’ll give them that...
113 2018-07-17 23:44:06 Interesting that they appear to be using a column krater to collect the oil - shows that vases may have been used for different things in different contexts.

116 2018-07-17 23:43:39 Therefor in his mind, war was inevitable, as he needed more resources (funds, oil, raw materials) for his military and as he stuck to his theory that the German people needed settlement areas in the East, wherefor Germany then attacked Russia, subsequently.
117 2018-07-17 23:43:39 You're right, well I do mine outside that space anyway. The hustling is unreal, and the system won't really encourage innovation based tech. Running the sector like it is some oil cabal.

124 2018-07-17 23:42:45 Does he know about Putin’s oil riches? Has he ever understood the hypocrisy of a Putin presidency the off years he’s not prime minister?
125 2018-07-17 23:42:44 We've reached that point in the summer where I go through like 4 of those oil remover wipes a day. Humidity sucks. That's all I'm sayin'.
126 2018-07-17 23:42:43 Dear Puerto Rican’s - Rick Scott will not answer our questions. Like his beach order to not enforce the law it is still the law. He will not answer why they are selling oil leases off of Florida’s coasts and he is hiding his financial disclosures! He has not changed -
127 2018-07-17 23:42:33 Coconut oil and shea butter FTW.
128 2018-07-17 23:42:27 Ok, that's a start. What's the chemical reaction, though? And, assuming it's ingested, how does it transfer from the stomach to the place it's needed? What dosage is needed? How do I know how much coconut oil is actually getting to the location of the eczema?

133 2018-07-17 23:41:59 My dad drilled it into me so hard that when you go for an oil change, they will always try to sell you stuff you don’t need, always say no. So I hear I am, 10 years of driving later, never changed my air filter bc my dad taught me too hard to say no

141 2018-07-17 23:41:08 No future president would let the economy get hurt to get green. If the tech isn't there we would force it. That's why it wasn't legally binding. Now the oil boys like our old sec of state can relax.Being wrong on this means dead great grandkids. You willing to make that bet?
142 2018-07-17 23:40:51 I use the Wahl Deluxe U-clip. It’s pretty decent if you oil it before and after use. Shaving, regardless of the brand, is just annoying and time-consuming though:)

157 2018-07-17 23:39:42 "Is the Heat getting to ya? Heh, this is nothing compared to working in the Texan Oil fields during the summer solstice. It gets so out there that even a cactus can get dehydrated." Dell smirks. "But seeing how your home is a Chinese Arctic town it's understandable. Heh heh heh."
158 2018-07-17 23:39:31 Dog poop is actually naturally acidic and it's PH is so high that it is actually more toxic to the environment than a comparable amount of motor oil. So when people don't pick up after their dogs, their waste ends up in stormwater runoff and polutes our rivers and streams.
159 2018-07-17 23:39:29 Senator, keep your eyes on the ball. The President- that you support- is more loyal to Putin than to our country. Iowans think that is a lot more pressing than OPEC oil right now.

The acid is used to treat a variety of viral infections because the body converts it into something called monolaurin, a compound that fights against bacteria, fungus,

164 2018-07-17 23:38:56 Okay, weed is something that helps with a lot of people’s issues so say it’s a drug all you want at least it is a drug you can no die from unless you smoke/eat 3x your body weight. The medical part in it is the CBD oil not the THC, CBD is the healing part of marijuana.

168 2018-07-17 23:38:35 Its not only BC that's getting screwed, we in alberta are as well. Gas oil goes up gasoline prices go up overnight.  Gas oil go down, gasoline goes up. But previous governments sold us out to foreign oil and didnt force building of refineries in Ab and Canada!!!
169 2018-07-17 23:38:32 Been playing Sonic Mania Plus. The new stuff is actually all right. Although some of the palette swaps are weird.

Changing Oil Ocean’s to blue just kills the whole theme of the level.

And whoever’s idea it was to change Metallic Madness to shit-brown should have been smacked.

173 2018-07-17 23:38:19 For example, on our honeymoon, I took Jane to Russia, back when it was still known as the Soviet Union. Russia was an incredible place back then, before the billionaires ruined everything. Who needs 30 different types of deodorant anyway?

176 2018-07-17 23:37:41 I don't have the bandwidth to go chasing information that may not be out there. But you're an expert on this who ought to be able to provide serious medical information. If coconut oil does what you say, then it has to work biochemically, right? We should know how, then.

181 2018-07-17 23:37:14 Keep laughing at your hysterics while wondering what you get out of obsessively focusing on being freaked out. Do you WANT clinical depression or something?! I never hear *anything* positive coming from the left. That attitude is no better than an oil spill.
182 2018-07-17 23:37:11 ummm, because trucks?  And because old people don't really care what millennials want?  And oil, there's that.
183 2018-07-17 23:37:09 Because I can't have one good thing in my life happen without have sonething shitty ruin it.

If anyone knows how to tell the difference between an oil leak and a radiator leak, let me know!  I need help.

185 2018-07-17 23:36:39 Trump’s “chaos” puts downward pressure on oil prices given he is allowing US shale production to expand and is freeing up more sites offshore and inland to drill. The point is that economically powerful counties have always meddled in elections and/or with existing politicians.

192 2018-07-17 23:35:43 I agree with you. Russia help get Trump elected, will forgive his debt, will give money to him, and remember Putin wanted to pump oil with Exxon in the ocean, but could not because of sanctions.

198 2018-07-17 23:34:33 Thinking about trying CBD oil for Sunny
199 2018-07-17 23:34:25 Ironic-we spend tons keeping troops in Germany to defend against Russia.  We put sanctions on Russia to financially hurt them.  Germany enriches Russia by buying oil & gas.  Our Troops in Germany adds tremendously to their economy.  Screw Germany move troops to Poland.
200 2018-07-17 23:34:23 Yeah its been nuts. So many sectors seeing action. Oil plays have been fun, and now crypto stocks are back in the conversation as bitcoin makes moves. Crazy... Just have to catch the trends, get in early and ride them up. I refuse to chase if I miss.
201 2018-07-17 23:34:20 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...no. He is a narcissistic snake oil salesman. Always has been, always will be.

203 2018-07-17 23:34:15 As someone who suffers from #fibromyalgia CBD oil is essential to simply being able to function and keeping extreme pain under control. Prescription medications have caused more harm than good for me. Banning it would lead to people like me back to being bedridden.
204 2018-07-17 23:33:52 You know, Mike—at least drop the Alfredo and replace it with garlic and olive oil.  AND, maybe replace the lasagna bolognese with sautéed salmon. VOILA!  That should do the trick.
205 2018-07-17 23:33:45 It can be so many things!!
Make sure to wash your sheets & pillowcases at least every week or so, oils can build up on them. Also make sure you’re cleaning your face before bed. even if you don’t wear makeup that day, dirt & oil can also build up on your skin w/sweat etc
206 2018-07-17 23:33:38 You are so ignorant. T is not going to “ get rid of NATO”. He just got them to put in 34 bil more for their own defense. T is hurting Russia by trying to get Germany to buy our oil and nixing  the German/Russia pipeline. You should really stop relying on Rachel and Lawrence etc.
207 2018-07-17 23:33:34 Wrong. He worked with the Saudis and OPEC to push oil prices down. He also imposed sanctions and expelled diplomats. AND he towered over Putin and looked at him like a little bitch when they met and shook hands. Putin was much worse off under Obama. Fact.
208 2018-07-17 23:33:33 I'm so fortunate to have uncles that taught me everything I'd need to know about working on my vehicles. From changing the oil to a total engine rebuild. My older bros. got me into the construction trade when I was young so I'm able to do any repairs to my home for free.

217 2018-07-17 23:32:24 You'll very afraid, poop in your underwear...while you get bad dream, Around the World join UK, Finland, other country protest against you. Someday, Saudi Arabia will stop send oil, gas until you get out of White House!
218 2018-07-17 23:32:24 This may be a weird question, but does anyone have any experience with CBD oil for pets? I've been considering trying it for my dog, she gets anxiety, and I also figure it would be good for her joints.
219 2018-07-17 23:32:21 If it wasn't for @scott_ronk introducing us to Robert and him taking the time for our kids a couple times a year. We wouldn't be non-wing fans today.

224 2018-07-17 23:31:02 This blunder will be forgotten in a couple weeks, but funding our military, pumping oil, selling weapons to Ukraine, bombing Syria and sanctions will still be there
225 2018-07-17 23:30:43 Yup I miss Obama bringing America to her knees, I miss his isis jv team, I miss him inviting everyone that has done something evil like the clock/bomb boy to the White House. I miss him trying to cause a race/civil war! I miss how he disregarded the oil spill & laughed @ it.
226 2018-07-17 23:30:41 And that last thing infuriates me. As does Trump's "we should have kept the oil.....maybe we'll have another chance to get the oil..."

248 2018-07-17 23:28:01 Are you talking about CBDa? Because that won’t get you high either. The point of CBD is to provide the benefits of marijuana without the high. What you’re describing to me, sounds like a badly filtered CBD oil that has THC in it still. I need some actual names so I can learn-
249 2018-07-17 23:27:48 I read a debunk of these conclusions saying what we all know that you can engineer "systematic reviews" by the criteria you choose to search on. Keep taking the fish oil and ignore them: they want you to take Statins instead.

251 2018-07-17 23:27:41 I didn't ask you to give me fanboy links. I asked for serious medical analysis of the interaction between the coconut oil and the eczema, skin, and so on. Also, there are multiple types of eczema, so does it work for all types? You're an expert who really ought to know this.
252 2018-07-17 23:27:15 Anything concentrated (eau de parfum or le parfum) or oil based that mixes with your chemistry well. Not rubbing your arms together to break up the scent notes. Spray or dab and let it dry.

259 2018-07-17 23:26:36 I find it interesting that Trump’s aluminum tariffs will help Russia whose major export (to other countries) is aluminum, oil & gas. Hmmm.
260 2018-07-17 23:26:21 Trump may have said the wrong thing but everything he’s doing is hurting Russia. Increasing sanctions, encouraging Europe to stop buying Russian oil, making NATO allies pay up to increase the power of NATO, putting our military back in Poland for protection from Russia #Wouldnt

262 2018-07-17 23:26:01 but for anything thick cut, it's seriously impossible to outdo. If you get an unsliced eye fillet, do it in the sous vide to rare/med.rare and then slice it up, finish it in super hot oil, it's cheating.

269 2018-07-17 23:24:30 I'm being slightly facetious here, mocking #Brexit, but we will be nimbler, we will have some financial control, and we will have our oil. If Ireland can cope, we certainly can!

277 2018-07-17 23:23:38 7pm -4am..  It's a great shift for Dr appointments and oil changes but not so good for concerts lol
278 2018-07-17 23:23:26 Wasn't this known way earlier anyway? They kept saying they might do it. Libya being dirty again. Let's hope that this doesn't affect a thing for tomorrow and the rest of the week.
279 2018-07-17 23:23:05 Couple of tips,add some oil & whatever veggies you like, finely diced onions,red pepper I like to add Greek seasoning & pepper.
Don’t over mix & keep the patties cold, & only flip once, let rest for 5 mins.
Seems like a lot but they can be very dry if you don’t.
280 2018-07-17 23:23:05 My suggestion is eucalyptus oil. Is it a dust cover or printed straight onto the book? If its the dust cover you might just have to risk damaging it, they're there for wear and tear anyway
281 2018-07-17 23:23:02 *pours groundnut oil and slides out. 

E go be 
282 2018-07-17 23:22:53 But it is. The Nordic countries rely on a tiny population with huge oil revenues. You can’t scale it.
283 2018-07-17 23:22:32 I see a 2000trl dollar Oil and Gas deal with out international law
284 2018-07-17 23:22:31 1700 from each citizen in Scotland or 9.9% of the UK tax burden on 8.4% of the population to prop up failed Westminster policy! BTW without Scottish oil rUk balance of payments will be draconian, look it up!
285 2018-07-17 23:22:29 Then why am I paying almost $3.00 a gallon for gas. Friends in the oil industry perhaps?

Your hyperbolic fear mongering and insinuations make you and Democratic Party laughing stocks.
293 2018-07-17 23:20:10 Nuclear power stations are super-heating the globe. On top of deforestation and emissions from burning enormous quantities of gas and oil, heat fom man-made nuclear fission does affect ocean temperatures. These sources of energy ruin the environment with actual heat emissions.
294 2018-07-17 23:20:07 My dogs keep farting up their fish oil supplements
295 2018-07-17 23:20:02 We ended up having to make a lot of concessions to get C&T reauthorized, oil refineries were largely exempted from GHG policy, for example. Still, as much as it hurt to offer concessions, it was absolutely the right call.
296 2018-07-17 23:19:59 @bulletproofexec is there a real difference between Brain Octane, MCT and organic coconut oil? Been a BP coffee drinker for almost 2 years now and don’t notice a difference.

306 2018-07-17 23:19:25 Might I suggest a different tack? Instead of bludgeoning people who peddle this bullshit ask them, for instance, what the biochemical mechanism is for sugar "feeding" cancer. Or for coconut oil "curing" eczema. Or whatever. If their claims are true, there must be one.
307 2018-07-17 23:19:25 He’s talking about him opening season with Oil in Sweden. Because of agreement with CHL he has to go back to Knights if he doesn’t stay with Oilers

311 2018-07-17 23:18:50 It's about the oil and gas money IMO.
312 2018-07-17 23:18:47 Ah, but you see, there are alternative energy sources, and no one thinks of oil, coal, etc. as inherently good. Auto-centric suburbia, by contrast, remains many people's image of the American Dream. They cannot envision a different paradigm, and they will oppose any threats to it

317 2018-07-17 23:17:43 Really?  Based on this, you can see how I would leap to that conclusion: “theres some folks who just think the only place we can find oil in Canada is in the tarsands. Its possibly the worst, most dirty, least clean way to mine Canadian oil”.
318 2018-07-17 23:17:30 @JustinTrudeau you might take these words of your father to heart!

Trans mountain purchase is bad. Tar sands oil is poor quality, expensive to produce & not in demand on the world market

323 2018-07-17 23:16:48 The thing that is the biggest threat to Russia is the American oil and gas industry and the one thing most on the left would like to shut down is that very industry. Just some food for thought.

364 2018-07-17 23:11:14 Help me show Americans how most of our problems result from oil addiction. Our tax $’s fund a military dedicated to protecting oil interests. Our energy $’s go directly to opec nations that fund radicalism. Our congress bows to the industry. We must declare war on fossil fuel!
365 2018-07-17 23:11:09 One time my mom told my dad that his car needed an oil change and he didn’t listen so when I broke down and he took it in and my mom asked what was wrong with it he told her it needed a flux capacitor

372 2018-07-17 23:10:39 Today that Russian asset met with congress trying to extend and expand the tax cuts that he pushed through earlier this year. Increasing our oil production also hurts Russia. I haven't seen anything done under Trump that strengthens Russia. You can judge a tree by its fruit

377 2018-07-17 23:10:19 People sometimes are under the impression that finding their property corners should cost as much as changing their oil or blowing out their sprinklers. What they don't realize is that land surveyors are required to stand behind their work for the rest of their lives.
378 2018-07-17 23:10:19 My argument isn't that Kamala Harris or Liz Warren aren't geniuses. OTOH, Ted Koppel sniffed out something was up with a Cohen interview. My argument is the people of Ted Koppel level intelligence who are right leaning are VP's at an oil company somewhere, leaving space for nuts.

388 2018-07-17 23:08:02 You ever plan a special night with the wife by putting a plastic mattress cover on the bed and squirting it with baby oil. It’s fun at first, but the second you say, “your sister fucks better” it is damn near impossible to hold on.
389 2018-07-17 23:07:58 the fact is ... trump got ahead of himself, then lied about his success with Un.  to you, it's wrong for ppl to point that out.  yesterday, was not about peace - instead, ego, again, and likely oil - you know, which putin can't control, that citgo has.  as  well, exxon.
390 2018-07-17 23:07:48 I love seeing rival fans taking about our spending like we are using oil money or something like that. We are using the money we have earned or the money we have made of transfers and that’s normal lad. So shut up and focus on your on club.

393 2018-07-17 23:07:08 That chart on the right - is people employed in the whole of Canada by oil. It was so few, they had to lump them in with mining and other industries. And they just laid of another 4000 in the tarsands because of automation. So no economic reason for the pipeline -thats BS

426 2018-07-17 23:01:37 All I ever wanted in life was to have clear skin and I think all I needed to achieve it was becoming single and some tea tree oil

429 2018-07-17 23:01:11 There is this certain “nut” you achieve when you have a full tank of gas, air put in your tires and a fresh oil change 
430 2018-07-17 23:01:04 Boil them in oil. Every single one of them
431 2018-07-17 23:01:00 Life hack: go to jiffy lube 6 minutes before they close to get your oil change. I was in and out in 5 minutes. Lol
432 2018-07-17 23:00:59 Why does castor oil smell like a smoker coughed it up??

435 2018-07-17 23:00:27 lol come to get an oil change & they tell me my brake lights are out  awesome.
436 2018-07-17 23:00:13 Actually, @realDonaldTrump has been tougher on Russia than Obama ever was. Much tougher sanctions, expelling Russian diplomats, closing Russian diplomatic sites, approving weapons sale to Ukraine, striking Syrian military sites, calling out NATO countries for buying Russian oil.
437 2018-07-17 23:00:12 Came for an oil change and met this guy & his wife and they just started talking to me about their life, where they live and that they like to fish lol. Cool people lol
438 2018-07-17 23:00:00 Some kind of cooking oil?
439 2018-07-17 22:59:57 #SDG7 on clean energy is already having an impact on the geo-politics of the world, as the energy moves from oil rich countries to those adapting to renewable energy! #HLPF2018 @UN @misum_sse
440 2018-07-17 22:59:55 Camila's budget must've came from some oil baron, since they did buy spotify top hits for the latest single so blatantly & now Havana's nominated for the best choreography xD Wherever money empowers quality, it's quick to fail, so it's kinda better Bangtan's name is not involved.

443 2018-07-17 22:59:43 coconut oil is like magic. it takes off your makeup. MAGIC.
444 2018-07-17 22:59:43 @jacshep it’s just oil field lingo 
445 2018-07-17 22:59:40 Thank you. Funny enough, I'm actually scheduled to make my family fish tacos for dinner tonight. Have to run to Ralph's to get the oil. Managed to forget the two previous trips I took there this week. 
446 2018-07-17 22:59:35 Ass taste like ass, but when she put coconut oil on her butthole it turns in to almond joy..... this nigga tho 
447 2018-07-17 22:59:32 She shouldn't forge vegetable oil
448 2018-07-17 22:59:22 coconut oil hates me ok
449 2018-07-17 22:59:22 "That's not food," he chuckled, pulling the fabric from her mouth. He still had some oil and grease on his shirt, but thankfully a nurse provided him with temporary scrubs to go over them. 

"We got ourselves a little fatty," he pointed to Tatum, who had chubby lil legs.

452 2018-07-17 22:58:42 Idiots ares taking up for Germany and talking about how our president mistreated Merkel he simply called out the woman for taking money from U.S. to protect her country against Russia but yet she's paying for 70% of the oil and gas Germany uses from Russia. And theres more.......
453 2018-07-17 22:58:37 That's cuz you don't fully commit and pour oil all over the floor
454 2018-07-17 22:58:35 Currency? Eh, no. WM have admitted they can’t stop Scotland using the £ if they wish.

EU Membership? Eh, no. Think you’ll find it was Leave telling the lies there.

Oil revenue? Eh, no. Price rising last I looked, and Google ‘McCrone Report’ for genuine lies about that.
455 2018-07-17 22:58:06 More so than the betrayal of Eastern Europe by FDR/Truman? Yalta, Moscow,Tehran, Potsdam summits were rousing successes? 
John McCain's history of now, makes this believable. Your hate of Trump blinds you to reality
456 2018-07-17 22:58:04 I literally do nothing to my hair.... no lie. However when Natural hair looks dusty and dry but you use a lot of oil and you can feel the oils on your hair, I usually recommend putting a rinse. That will leave the strands solid. The sun fades all hair types
457 2018-07-17 22:57:43 @jblags with small economy regulation&tariff to protect production.trades in oil monoproduct dependent on foreign industry experts is slavin
458 2018-07-17 22:57:32 Oh god what a joke !
459 2018-07-17 22:57:24 Getting more oil revenue,  stable power supply,  ghs3.5b from ESLA,  capped all statutory funds by 25%, collected more taxes,  borrowed ghs37b more, built NOTHING...AND NPP WANTS TO INCREASE TAXES ?

460 2018-07-17 22:57:18 The American gov't is trying to legalize wild horse slaughter within the US so that Big Oil, Big Cattle, & Big Sheep can use PUBLIC lands for PRIVATE profit. The BLM is targeting horse activists that have stood up to them, & are threatening to remove "their" wild horses first.
461 2018-07-17 22:57:07 It is drilled from the ground as oil. Transported to a refinery. Turned to Gas.Shipped, trucked or piped to a station. Put in a 2ton car and which each gallon can move~25 mile. Each gal has tax of ~80cents. The station workers/owner,transporters,oil workers and more get paid.

463 2018-07-17 22:56:53 Want to Be a Manga Artist, Too Oil Paints If this goes on, Priss and Linna are able to placate my anger.
464 2018-07-17 22:56:16 Markham Hislop checked with several experts. Consensus was that it wouldn't have halted BC's court reference. (I agree that the pipeline should go ahead, instead of leaving money on the table due to the discount on Canadian oil.)
465 2018-07-17 22:55:10 I just burnt oil and broke our trash can
466 2018-07-17 22:55:00 I need oil for my car and i wasn’t trying to buy some cause i wanted to change the oil pan gasket but fuck that’s too much work 
467 2018-07-17 22:54:41 Wonderful news! Oil and gas workers were put on hold for several years just as we were about to get amped up!! Plus oil royalties have slowly started to increase but not where we were 4 years ago!! #Texas #KeepTexasRed #TexasStrong 
468 2018-07-17 22:54:26 My mom is on a new diet right now and I'm actually kinda enjoying the food she is having for this diet! I'm head over heels for coconut oil on dates!
469 2018-07-17 22:54:22 Those who prefer diplomacy, I will always be on the side of diplomacy.  Have we not had enough wars for oil?
470 2018-07-17 22:53:41 its pretty messed up that the earth has been so fucked by pollution that @DawnDish soap's entire marketing campaign is, "Hey... this stuff will get hella oil off baby ducks"
471 2018-07-17 22:53:14 For a good day to day use that is safe for the kitty too is to mix a water bottle with water and 2-4 drops of lavender or cedar oil and spray around the house! You can spray it your bed and the kitty’s bed too and it smells good too!
472 2018-07-17 22:53:13 やったぜ！
473 2018-07-17 22:52:56 @quickquack you guys turned my blue car purple, left bugs on the car, left water stains on, and made the car oily. A friend said oil is on your midders. Never going again, Randall Brothers will have my money.
474 2018-07-17 22:52:50 @CarterLibrary I think I can actually say that #JimmyCarter was probably the last President almost entirely for the People. And I think people on both sides of the coin could probably agree...Yes, I remember the Oil Crisis...However, I still say what I say.
475 2018-07-17 22:52:31 Turkey will be going to the Petro yuan as well.  Same with Iraq and Iran, belt and road.  Also China needs the oil for their SPR, this is the reason they launched the yuan contract
476 2018-07-17 22:52:23 See I moisturise, then either use a priming oil or the Nivea express hydration primer, then a dewy foundation and it’s still horrible and flakey :( I’m not blessed with naturally oily skin. Who’d have thought I’d ever wish for it haha
477 2018-07-17 22:52:17 Not for money. Not for oil!
478 2018-07-17 22:52:02 I need an oil change but idk where to goooo
479 2018-07-17 22:51:56 #Libia/2. E' curioso, molto curioso, che ogni volta che spunta una nave Ong di #VosThalassa (rimorchiatore per piattaforma off-shore Total-Mabruk Oil) e #ProactivaOpenArms (impianti Repsol), i "salvataggi" di #migranti siano più o meno vicini a quelle piattaforme di lavoro.
480 2018-07-17 22:51:50 maybe try putting a little bit of baby oil to help peel it off?
481 2018-07-17 22:51:23 Politics & filthy lucre. Russia protects Syria and Iran from US and allies contd aggrandisement of ME land and oil and oil/gas piplines. UK arms dealers & companies making fortunes out of supplying arms to Saudi to bomb Yemen & back this with UK “assistance”. UK media backs govt
482 2018-07-17 22:51:08 I pull it out of the fridge, salt it on all sides, and let it come to room temp. Season it, then into a 225° oven until it's about 130-135 in the middle. Let it rest for about 5 minutes, then sear it in a smoking hot cast iron, with a bit vegetable oil, on all sides
483 2018-07-17 22:51:00 Why y’all buying perfume oil ?

487 2018-07-17 22:50:34 Haha no! I mean they have protein but they are classified as a fat. Add some to your smoothie! Nd coconut oil :)
488 2018-07-17 22:50:29 Dude this means so much to me, especially since I’m going through some hard stuff with my own boy right now. Idk if you saw my previous tweet to Brina but I think he has dementia. I switched his food to Bright Minds and he’s taking some CBD oil too. My boss is seeing him Friday
489 2018-07-17 22:50:22 There are unblemished lambs,pigeons(chicken),flour & olive oil if we look!
You think TMH commands us to offer sacrifice,& He not provide em?
490 2018-07-17 22:50:15 Before or after you apply done beard oil?
491 2018-07-17 22:49:50 Not funny: Trumps industry buddies want to bottle Canada’s fresh water, take oil, gas, minerals, gold, diamonds, master the NW passage. Trumps also wants these resources. Who the hell can stop the two devils?
492 2018-07-17 22:49:27 Look at it like this. You just showed up on the scene of an accident. You see a car upside down, glass on the road and people crying on the sidewalk. To find out why you go to the root of the causality. Oil in the streets is to blame. Atmospheric distortion is to blame not curve
493 2018-07-17 22:49:13 josh or oil they are both boring
494 2018-07-17 22:49:11 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww

497 2018-07-17 22:48:52 I wash my hair with Aussie Moist Hydrating Shampoo and deep condition with their Deep Deep conditioner for 15 minutes. I then use Doo Gro yellow oil bottle and seal all that with conditioner. Let the hair air dry. 3C curly hair. Everything is under like $25
498 2018-07-17 22:48:50 Coconut oil
499 2018-07-17 22:48:49 They are going to invade Iran and “take” the oil. It’s been the whole ball of wax. Oil and controlling its price. +$100 /barrel.
500 2018-07-17 22:48:42 It is unequivocally my favourite ship! Getting back in it again after a long trip in the oil tanker has reminded me of its awesomeness! #MagicalSpaceTurtle
501 2018-07-17 22:48:42 Like oh wow making gravy from scratch is SO MUCH WORK wink wink nudge nudge it’s fine and you can stand over the super hot boiling oil #amimean
502 2018-07-17 22:48:39 But the thing is liverpool have earned all the money they have spent, Man City just got oil money

508 2018-07-17 22:47:15 Who of my friends use essential oils? I use a few myself, but want to know what you use, and for what purpose. What’s your favourite oil or blend?
509 2018-07-17 22:47:10 Things I could’ve done in the time it took me to drive ten measly lmiles home in #Austin this afternoon:

1. Fly to Dallas
2. Watch 1/3 of The Hobbit
3. Bake two trays of brownies
4. Change my oil three times
5. Decide to move literally anywhere with a population lower than here
510 2018-07-17 22:47:08 should i try cbd oil for my hand/wrist pains? ive heard good things but idk.
511 2018-07-17 22:47:00 Ruben took my coconut oil because he knew he was gonna meet up w/ this guy from Grindr
512 2018-07-17 22:46:51 Special thanks to Brett for a case of TP. Dragonfly Beach needs citronella oil for the Tiki torches. We can never have too much.
513 2018-07-17 22:46:50 WELCOME TO HELL!! 

I ended up buying a freestanding wheel. Much quieter, plus you can grease it with vegetable oil which they'll snack on.
514 2018-07-17 22:46:50 I suppose one could learn to like pain, or use topical creams like this...Icy Hot Vapor Gels for colds active ingredients are camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oil. Or just be an active adult film star, these are things I've tried
515 2018-07-17 22:46:42 The Russians are desperate for that. Opening up the oil supplies would transform their economy but, as she says, they don't have the technology that Exxon has. This is why getting rid of the sanctions is so very important to them.
516 2018-07-17 22:46:40 We must stand firm against Trump, today he is selling off our monument lands for sheer profit for the oil companies.  It is our land he is selling.  No No No
517 2018-07-17 22:46:05 Do regular grocery stores in France carry coconut oil?? Will I need to pack a jar in my checked bag?? This is not a rhetorical question please I need help
518 2018-07-17 22:45:56 I needa change my oil before going to the bay on Thursday 
519 2018-07-17 22:45:52 #KeepCanadaWorking
What is this oil propaganda? That looks Howe Sound. God dammit Alberta, go back to the Stone age
520 2018-07-17 22:45:49 What's with all these snake oil salesmen giving hope to the lame?
521 2018-07-17 22:45:41 あらぁ､､､

523 2018-07-17 22:45:35 I don't know why he's adding extra oil to it.  peanuts contain plenty of oil.  Maybe because he's not using a vitamix.  The peanut butter I get is super smooth.  His looks grainy.  Grainy peanut butter gets under my dentures, lol.
524 2018-07-17 22:45:32 My neighbor did my oil change while I’m on vacation he’s a real one

528 2018-07-17 22:44:55 Exactly. And the same boobs who accuse the oil industry of being “subsidized” based on tax policy, not cash grants, would be only too happy to snort up the $14,000 when buying a Tesla. #hypocriticalscumbag
529 2018-07-17 22:44:40 Everyone casts aspersions at Russia until Putin brings out the billions, and then its opening up dialogue. Clintons, Olympic Committee, FIFA, countries buying oil and gas, countries selling uranium. The outrage is concocted and fake. They all love Putins Billions.
530 2018-07-17 22:44:39 “God, just give me one more oil boom and I promise this time I won’t screw it up.”
531 2018-07-17 22:44:27 I went to get my oil changed & dude pulled out the cabin filter & wanna talk about $49. No sir, put it back where u found it

534 2018-07-17 22:43:59 Yeah, because polished, professional snake oil salesmen are sooooooo much better
535 2018-07-17 22:43:53 Anyone need a recommendation on oil change places, I gotchu fam 
536 2018-07-17 22:43:51 As the silver mining industry is continuously affected by decline of ore grade, the cost will only continue to increase. However, the biggest impact on the silver industry is not from the decline of ore grades, but from oil in the world.

537 2018-07-17 22:43:39 So yesterday I got an oil change and today they put in new brakes... it cost me a total of $0... my husband on the other hand has a nice bill waiting for him at the shop and he is currently getting paid 
538 2018-07-17 22:43:38 Financially, the EU doesn't need the UK. 
The UK, however, really needs Scotland. 
 The UK can't balance its books without the money earned by our oil and whisky exports. 
Scotland, time to flex our muscles.
539 2018-07-17 22:43:30 Yes, part of what you say is right. Some peace activists and peaceful minded ppl are  exist. But Israel were created after NAKBA. Israel were created for oil interests. Everything about Israel is fack. I can't say easily part of them are good. Unfortunately
540 2018-07-17 22:43:26 I also got a large pot of cigarette oil...
541 2018-07-17 22:43:13 You had 3 years with Oil Kings and did nothing.  Good luck Hitmen
542 2018-07-17 22:43:12 You’re welcome! I’m confident in the market moving away from fossil fuels! Today I saw that investment worldwide in power outstripped oil & gas in 2017, for the first time. Electrification gathering pace.

550 2018-07-17 22:42:01 After oil, #coffee is the most traded product around the world! #coffeefacts
551 2018-07-17 22:41:43 Your car #dealership sells the mileage information to your #insurance company for all those cheap and sometimes free "certified oil changes". So, not surprising. Happened to me. #notsurprised
552 2018-07-17 22:41:43 John it's the oil wealth...and majority of the oil companies are western owned. Therefore vested interest.  If we went Solar as Hinduism advocates then this death cult would not be spreading.
553 2018-07-17 22:41:37 i fall in love with a grease monkey employee every time I get my oil changed it’s not fair

557 2018-07-17 22:40:27 .@ChelseyxLynn Can of tuna, mayonnaise, tin of sweetcorn and a jar of mayonnaise.

Drain the oil/brine and water from tins and add sweetcorn & tuna to a bowl with 2 or 3 table spoons of mayonnaise and stir.

You now have the base to make a tuna sweetcorn sandwich.

559 2018-07-17 22:40:23 How did Reagan defeat the USSR? Does anybody remember? He bankrupted them. Tough to do since they were pumping oil like gangbusters, building a huge pipeline into Western Europe, and the price of crude was around $30/bbl. Remember that the USSR had just spent a huge amount of...

561 2018-07-17 22:40:10 No manufacturing jobs in Houston, Texas. Oil and gas will not hire newbies. Healthcare requires specialized degrees.
562 2018-07-17 22:40:07 Wiess Energy Hall @hmns has been bought out by oil companies to promote the fracking agenda and merely presents clean renewable energy as a short formality. We should be pushing for a sustainable future instead of dwelling on the biased present.
563 2018-07-17 22:40:07 Repurposed oil rig drill pipe. That is welded then various panels put in place. But. It is the premier farm fencing.
564 2018-07-17 22:39:52 Trump didn’t give Putin billions of dollars to fund terrorism like Obama did. Nor did he trade 5 terrorists for a deserter. He also got on Germany’s case for buying oil and gas from Russia. Your stupidity is showing.

566 2018-07-17 22:39:43 ...& to make it clear to Putin
American & our allies will be puting sanctions on all oil & gas exports from Russia 
Because Trump is Putin's Pawn & Trump is his money launder
he will forgive Putin
lift sanctions & hand him Crimea
-Impeach Trump NOW - vote out all Republicans
567 2018-07-17 22:39:42 @guardian why am I donating to you? Fish oil is on the front page, and the leave campaign breaking the law isn't... it seems quite unbelievable to me.

I appreciate how far you went in the cannabis oil fight, but there are still miles and miles of roadblocks to get through, and @CaseyCagle isn’t the right bulldozer. Step off the Republican train and join @staceyabrams.

576 2018-07-17 22:38:04 Ireland is already moving its oil reserves out of the U.K.
577 2018-07-17 22:38:01 I remember going to port Harcourt for @PTDF_Nigeria scholarship 2015 exam back then, Sanitation day, had to trek to the venue, didn't get it. Twist of fate, my roomie in the UK was on the scholarship without writing any exam. I am from oil community, he's not.

579 2018-07-17 22:37:50 It cannot be 108° and humid. This is not acceptable. I had to run errands today, and I felt as though I were simmering in oil. Back home in the air conditioning, I haven’t an ounce of energy.

585 2018-07-17 22:37:19 Trumps actions speak volumes! arming Ukraine, killing Russians in Syria, increasing oil production, attacks Germanys pipeline deal, strong NATO, building up military, expelling diplomats, amazing judges, tax cuts, NK/Iran, jobs, economy, killed ACA Penalty, + working on borders
586 2018-07-17 22:37:18 #tytlive Trump is bombing Russia's ally in Syria, Trump is arming Nazis in Ukraine that are fighting Russia, and Trump is threatening Germany for daring to try to import oil from Russia. Putin's getting everything he ever dreamed of, huh?

589 2018-07-17 22:37:06 So just a few minutes ago I was casually walking into the kitchen as my mom was cooking and holding a bottle of grape seed oil 
She then decides to turn around......we both hit each other... AND BAM ....... oil all over me, her, and the floor...

611 2018-07-17 22:34:40 No it's not. Wages are down. The market is flat. GDP growth below 3% and oil prices are higher. You can only gaslight about 33% of Americans.
612 2018-07-17 22:34:39 For example, as evidenced in the action alerts I've sent you all, the Trump admin is censoring science, loosing up oil drilling safety regulations, putting a citizenship question on the census,  and trying to put a far right ideologue on the Supreme Court among many other things.
613 2018-07-17 22:34:31 this the only one that doesn’t dry out my hair from using it too much. I used to use the olive oil one but this one works better on my hair. That’s crazy.

688 2018-07-17 22:23:43 Fab! You must do something with the courgette flowers...delicious fried in a little olive oil, garlic and lemon juice.

698 2018-07-17 22:22:22 They are indeed. I see it every day. So, are you asking all of your oil change customers if they are selling a business?
699 2018-07-17 22:22:11 Fuck bru how can you live in az and NOT check the oil or water in your car.... #itsstillyourcar
700 2018-07-17 22:21:54 Of course they are! We can't have this peacemaking, now! How do you think those bankers, oil men and defense contractors are gonna make money if you do that?
Better remember the statement we made on the streets of Dallas. In broad daylight so you'd never forget.

717 2018-07-17 22:18:38 I got hot oil in my eye , Great. 
718 2018-07-17 22:18:32 Wow you really are indoctrinated...GL with that but i hate seeing vulnerable people getting conned. BTW the Cascadia mega thrust has been known about before snake oil man started championing it. Blind devotion never a good thing. #facts

721 2018-07-17 22:18:21 You're sounding like it is normal.
Norway didn't emerge overnight .
Yet it's the same oil they have that we have & we're talking about 30k being a lot of money.
That's about $84, about 1/17 of what Norwegians are about to be earning without a day's work.
Stop normalizing rubbish.

726 2018-07-17 22:18:01 My Porsche 997 Turbo has 4 lift points and that’s it. I prefer to have it completely off the floor and level when changing oil and other maintenance and repairs. Now I have a simple solution that is much safer than using multiple floor jacks.
727 2018-07-17 22:18:00 Lmao I got bit by a dog swear someone said put coconut oil on it
728 2018-07-17 22:17:44 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
729 2018-07-17 22:17:20 they use coconut oil for everything else. Conditioner, cooking, body oil, shoe polish, lubricant, lip gloss. Fuck boy repellent.
730 2018-07-17 22:16:55 I prefer oil warmers.
731 2018-07-17 22:16:49 I think I was very generous with the catchment numbers. I went with worst case. Hard to define. Interesting demographic. Lots of supporters of other clubs, with the oil industry.

739 2018-07-17 22:16:11 Sometimes that's diplomacy.  Especially with people like Putin, he's not going to be intimidated. No point in poking the bear. Better to work on how nations function and sap power from Russia so Putin doesn't have so much power. So much of it rests of Russian oil.
740 2018-07-17 22:15:57 I’m not sure, I have really dry skin so mike just sucks it all right up, but maybe use a lil less olive oil, maybe just enough to get the grounds wet. Geranium oil helps control skins oil production though.
741 2018-07-17 22:15:48 You bring the oil and I'm down
742 2018-07-17 22:15:38 We must have diplomacy; regardless of the players involved. There has been enough wars for oil. Why do people not see this?  The intelligence agencies do not run the USA. Have you not watched any documentaries in the last 50 years?
743 2018-07-17 22:15:37 You sound like you have an allergy to them like me  try get the oil but if all fails the anti histamines and keep covered up at dusk. They nearly drive me nuts too. Keep ur windows closed!

770 2018-07-17 22:12:24 Re: Valter Longo, I mentioned his book because he's a non-vegan who recognizes that veganism is very healthy. He only recommends a bit of fish for DHA, but algal oil is an even better (vegan) alternative considering farmed fish are horribly unhealthy...

774 2018-07-17 22:11:39 Seems like it would be safer. I don't think nicotine alone is super harmful. It seems to need an oil like they mix it with for pest control. It's gonna be several more years for even basic data. Bugs hate tobacco smoked or not.

799 2018-07-17 22:07:25 I've spent a lot of time inside hospitals as a maintenance man.
The only way to shut one down is cut off the water. Eventually they'd run out of diesel oil, but a hospital (or a telephone office) has big generators in its guts.
But yes, we have built an absurdly fragile society.
800 2018-07-17 22:07:23 As I said, it would be like a Green MP voting for some fossil fuel regulations but being an open advocate for the oil industry.

811 2018-07-17 22:06:28 And oil and gas is not subsidized. Was just reading the other day how half of US oil production would be unprofitable without subsidies.
812 2018-07-17 22:06:24 I randomly started thinking today about how in Seinfeld Kramer wanted to make his own company called Kramerica Industries which wanted to put ketchup and mustard in the same bottle, make oil bladder systems, and start a restaurant that only served pb&j sandwiches

Hugo Chàvez nationalized the oil industry, and supplanted experts in the field with friends and family. He gave away free tv’s, washers, dryers, when he couldn’t afford to.
818 2018-07-17 22:06:01 It’s a supplement, not an oil.

821 2018-07-17 22:05:09 Seriously?

826 2018-07-17 22:04:51 30k can barely be enough for a bachelor to survive in Lagos not to talk of a married woman with a kid.
Yet 30k is a 'lot of money'.
Do you know that in Norway, their Oil Fund owned by the citizens, can afford to pay out $1500 per month by 2030?
But 30k is a lot.

832 2018-07-17 22:04:24 Yes...without a doubt Russia wants that Nat Gas ...16T Cubic Feet...largest find in man's history, can easily power Israel for 40 years ..and 600 million barrels of oil. A biblical amount of prosperity for Israel ..ironically named Leviathan .
833 2018-07-17 22:04:23 I'm all for it! but also remember the "Big four" oil subsidies aren't really subsidies at all!  There are, however, some real oil subsidies for O&G that should be removed. But, in general, taxes on O&G are extremely important revenue sources for many governments across the world.

842 2018-07-17 22:03:23 I'd rec covering it with a thick layer of baking soda & letting it sit for a couple of hours--then scrape up the baking soda with a spatula. It will absorb the oil.

872 2018-07-17 21:59:24 funny - despite 80% of Venezuela's economy being private, it's Socialist because they nationalized their oil, so their problems are all on socialism

Russia is a military nuclear power

Russia is #nothing without oil, natural gas and the threat of nuclear arms. These 3 are interdependant.

970 2018-07-17 21:45:42 Everyone going on about essential oils and I'm just like "well I've got my engine oil over here and my two stroke oil over there and they're both essential to keeping my motorcycle running so yeah"
971 2018-07-17 21:45:41 Thanks to you putting the oil companies back in charge ... The c02 levels doubled now heat waves all across the country ... Thanks a lot for helping them destroy the planet the rest of the way
972 2018-07-17 21:45:29 What it looks like when you try to replace the oil filter on a car.
973 2018-07-17 21:45:24 Had to prep these for lunch service in a French restaurant in Clerkenwell in 1983! (I was 16) I  tomatoes but never liked them stuffed. Simply sliced with fresh chives, sea salt & olive oil or on bruschetta with garlic & flat leaf parsley, juice saved for a shot of Vodka 
974 2018-07-17 21:45:23 Take my fishing reels apart and clean, oil and grease them and then put them back together.... does that sound like fun ???

976 2018-07-17 21:45:16 My grandfather was Russian so I guess I'm part Russian - maybe. But I never knew I was a bot! Guess I'll have to research bots now. Is it a mindset? am I an actual machine? do I intake machine oil or food? So many questions. Good thing CNN is here to help me self-identify.

978 2018-07-17 21:45:07 If you are a fan of coconut oil, you are going to love what we have waiting for you at Basic Foods!!!
979 2018-07-17 21:45:05 Probably not much in terms of decades or centuries as maybe it is more than plastic being used once but eventually they will break up and end up as micro or nano plastic pollution. We not only have to ween ourselves off of fossil fuels but any oil based uses.
980 2018-07-17 21:45:01 I just had a salad 100% picked from our garden. (OK, I made the dressing with olive oil from Greece.)
981 2018-07-17 21:44:46 I can’t wait to get off & get this full oil body massage I had a long day 
982 2018-07-17 21:44:43 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

987 2018-07-17 21:44:17 She lost because of Russia, the corrupt GOPs voter suppression and cross check.  Where is your outrage with this?  What, it only matters if snake oil salesman Bernie is involved?
988 2018-07-17 21:44:13 We have been involved in the Middle East and Central Asia since a lot earlier than the 1980s and that ultimately relates to oil but also to the post-colonial pull-back of the British Empire, Israel, and Cold War containment.

But these aren't the reasons we invaded Iraq in 2003.

991 2018-07-17 21:43:57 Oils to use for hair growth:
- horsetail plant oil 
- lavender oil 
- peppermint oil 
- chamomile oil 
- coconut oil 
- rosemary oil 
- lemongrass oil 
- my personal favourite: castor oil 
992 2018-07-17 21:43:41 It’s so funny when you get an oil change and the guy shows you the dipstick and you have to act like you know what tf good oil looks like
993 2018-07-17 21:43:39 Well in all fairness he’s kind of everyone except the voters puppet. Takes coal/oil/natural gas industry side, takes pharmaceuticals side, takes NRA side, takes heath insurance side, takes payday lenders side, take North Korea’s side, takes Putin’s side. Monster! 
994 2018-07-17 21:43:38 If you have cinnamon and sugar, then you could cook the apples (sliced or chopped) with those seasonings in some butter. Then  cook the tortillas in a little bit of oil for a sweet apple quesadilla thing. That’s the best I’ve got lol
995 2018-07-17 21:43:34 hair looking sleek as fuck dougie! i’ll give you a tip! if you use old deep fryer grease instead of olive oil you’ll get an even more sleek look, and it’ll smell like french fries! #beauty #stud
996 2018-07-17 21:43:33 The budtinder that always seems to be working when I pick up CBD oil is high as a kite, but he always tells me "I appreciate you," and it's kind of a mood booster.
997 2018-07-17 21:43:26 OK so if someone spilled oil all over the bottom of your oven, would running the self-clean cycle fix the problem or just set your house on fire?
998 2018-07-17 21:43:14 Going to get my oil changed is one of the most anxiety provoking experiences and idk why
999 2018-07-17 21:43:04 Only if that bread comes on a charcuterie board with olive oil dipping sauce. Some antipasto sides with fresh mozzarella would be nice too. what was i saying again. oh yeah, capitalism 
1000 2018-07-17 21:42:39 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. I'll get a good price!
1001 2018-07-17 21:42:29 #Trump left summit w/ample criticism by #AntiTrump & #MSM. So tired of the dissing of Trump 24/7. Trump's actions; arming Ukraine, killing Russians in Syria, increasing our oil production, attacks Germany's pipeline deal, strong NATO, building up our military, expelling diplomats
1002 2018-07-17 21:42:25 Barrel of palm oil is N120k. Barrel of crude is N30k. Each tree yields N10k per annum. Input cost per tree less than N1k per annum. Of course these are simplifications but just check Presco results.
1003 2018-07-17 21:42:06 Tea tree oil works wonders!! Legit I had a bump on my nose piercing and 3 days later it was gone #Blessed
1004 2018-07-17 21:42:03 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1005 2018-07-17 21:41:54 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
1006 2018-07-17 21:41:54 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1008 2018-07-17 21:41:47 19703 was not the 1 st day of Saudi oil. The UK deal with the oil co’s is very weak, needs to be revisited.
1009 2018-07-17 21:41:41 If Trump really wanted to hurt the Russian economy, all he must do is enforce the sanctions Congress passed. Seriously. Our allies would be on board, and Merkel would buy her oil from us..aiding our economy. A little different when someone with practical knowledge replies, right?
1010 2018-07-17 21:41:24 with oil....and then....without.....either way, a success
1011 2018-07-17 21:41:07 Comedy gold words from Lizzie 2k18 “ he tied a banana”  I mean when Joel said KFC I thought nice then remember the KFC incident with the chicken and oil  and that has put my off KFC forever ! @Smallishbeans @LDShadowLady

I would love to know your opinions and thoughts on Medical Marijuana and CBD Oil!   For it or against it and why?

1017 2018-07-17 21:40:28 No screws means the bed takes less time to put together. Coconut oil soaked books smell really good. I’m not seeing the problem. Also, that sucks.
1018 2018-07-17 21:40:15 If I had a dollar for every mile over an oil change I am, money would not be an issue anymore
1019 2018-07-17 21:40:06 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
1020 2018-07-17 21:39:57 Taking Oil Companies under State ownership is possible - but complicated / expensive because it was not done from Day 1
1021 2018-07-17 21:39:57 The chicken sandwich is cooked in a separate vat. Pretty much everything is cooked in in their own individual oil. And they would have to be since the time taken for each seperate item to cook is different.

1023 2018-07-17 21:39:44 • DO NOT shampoo your hair everyday.
• wash your hair with cold water or rinse it with cold water at the end of your shower. This also helps the texture of your hair 
• use an oil or mask weekly 
• get consistent trims (doesn’t work for everyone)
1024 2018-07-17 21:39:32 So why do we still pay for oil from other countries? Has troubled me for the last couple years

1027 2018-07-17 21:39:29 I can feel your healing oil running down my brow,

I wouldn't trade another lifetime for how I feel right now.

1028 2018-07-17 21:39:21 Yes, depending on the location! Especially any cities near the oil rigs! When we drive out west we usually avoid that area.
1029 2018-07-17 21:39:16 Essentially they are raised on the oil which is the resource that’s being consumed.
1030 2018-07-17 21:39:06 EP, Iran has entrenched itself in Syria & Lebanon targeting Israel. Netanyahu & Trump w/Putin(who appears to be on board) & possibly Jordan & S.Arabia are trying to remove them from the area. (I believe Russia has future aims 4 Israel's oil & gas which may be the ultimate "hook")

1037 2018-07-17 21:38:18 That’s a question for you to answer. You’re the one that said Merkel was cowardly for buying Russian oil. All I did was point out that the United States does too.
1038 2018-07-17 21:38:16 Results in the last 24h:
1. Trump and Putin affirm commitment to Israel security
2. More protests and riots in Iran
3. Iraq switches electricity supplier to Saudi
4. Iran oil production projected down 60% by end of year
5. Iran soldiers killed in Syria
6. Russia not helping Iran

1043 2018-07-17 21:37:47 Not the case - Private Companies get ALL the income from Oil

Taxes are raised from:
Company Profits
Local Sales Duty & VAT
Employee Income Tax
1044 2018-07-17 21:37:41 WTI Crude Oil -0.2% to 68.03 bbl $USO

1045 2018-07-17 21:37:32 Err. I literally said ‘for better or for worse’, comparing the approaches of oil clubs and sustainable clubs. It’s a conversation had within football. You took it personally and took it to insults based on dead fans. Embarrassed for u, mate.

1061 2018-07-17 21:35:02 Your comment about war was ridiculous. Trump/Russia is an act. They hated Obama and HRC because of Oil prices. Trump demeans our foreign services, then complains about NFL patriotism. Can't you see the performance in front of you.
1062 2018-07-17 21:35:01 We need to plan to reduce unnecessary imports to Pakistan to reduce the trade deficit, 
Unnecessary imports of milk , wheat , edible oil, soyabean, 
Development of indigenous industry 
No to trade , yes to manufacturing 
@FarhanKVirk kindly make a trend  @AsadRattay @maXes_MB
1063 2018-07-17 21:35:01 This is exactly why Trump played it the way he did in Helsinki.  He used the platform to butter up Putin, while baiting the conspirators on the homefront. Now Putin cant attack Germany on the oil deal dying and NATO, and Trump pulled the veil off the IC leaders.
1064 2018-07-17 21:34:59 I had thought about coconut oil. I've been putting on a organic balm by bamboobies
1065 2018-07-17 21:34:53 Question: What is the biochemical process by which coconut oil heals eczema?
1066 2018-07-17 21:34:19 But the whole world  has their tongue their arsess when it comes to them saying something to Putin. They hide behind sanctions! Tough guys! All the while buying his oil and energy and getting paid for speeches! Unbelievable hypocrisy!

1075 2018-07-17 21:32:43 @seanhannity Moscow meeting was fluff. Trump knows that Putin plays a weak hand, (unlimited resources/poor infrastructure + rampant corruption = no sustained economic growth) The real meeting took place when Trump told Europe they could get US oil and LNG. Russian Monopoly over.
1076 2018-07-17 21:32:43 Iraqi people seek their basic simple rights ! Billions of dollars the daily income of oil and there is no even pure water to have a shower in Basrah. Government refutes the constitutional items by trying to  suppress the peaceful protests. #IraqProtests #Save_the_Iraq_people
1077 2018-07-17 21:32:37 NZ has the worst, most inept and chaotic govt of our entire history, accidently placed there because of fraudulent MMP. Ardern bans oil and gas, virtue signals, makes and breaks promises, hundreds of committees and talk-fests, petrol up, etc. NZ Voters deserve a better system!
1078 2018-07-17 21:32:33 I’ve been wanting to try their babyfacial...maybe I’ll splurge. I also just bought the Kiehl’s midnight recovery oil and literally can’t stop buying face masks

1085 2018-07-17 21:31:37 I never mentioned Rachael Maddow. Your Trumpie friend did. It’s none of the president’s business who a sovereign country buys its oil from. Stop deflecting from the fact that Trump has repeatedly lied about his Russian connections. What is he hiding?

1098 2018-07-17 21:30:09 So I learn that you can make cookies with applesauce instead of oil or butter and I don’t know what to do with this information.

I would say it’s the poor man’s cookie but who doesn’t have butter in their house?

Know that I will never gift you applesauce substituted cookies.
1099 2018-07-17 21:30:05 Just got my oil changed all by myself. This is my initiation into adulthood
1100 2018-07-17 21:30:05 Lavender essential oil is a natural sedative. It promotes relaxation in your nervous system. At times when you feel stressed or your conf...
1101 2018-07-17 21:30:00 I’ve been waiting forever just for an oil change and my phone is 4%
1102 2018-07-17 21:29:44 We should ban on import of consumer items and luxury items like home appliances, vehicles, mobiles and too many other luxury items in first step to reduce the import payments and get deferral of oil payments from Saudia for at least 3 years
1103 2018-07-17 21:29:44 Those of you saying 4 eggs is just 160 or 200 naira forgot to add money for gas and oil and pepper and Maggi and onions and ati bebelo?
1104 2018-07-17 21:29:37 I'm at the place I usually get oil changes at and the guys that know me aren't here. 
1105 2018-07-17 21:29:25 do you eat fish? If not: it helps taking fish oil pills to get your brain a bit less tangled!
1106 2018-07-17 21:29:20 I can twist tf out of anybody’s hair except my own  it was dry, stretched out, I had my oil and cream...not too big of twists, not too small..my hair just doesn’t cooperate
1107 2018-07-17 21:29:14 And try a homemade bath bomb with coconut oil. You’ll feel great
1108 2018-07-17 21:29:14 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
1109 2018-07-17 21:29:11 ربنا يوفقك نهله
1110 2018-07-17 21:28:41 How many gallons of fuel oil and therefore lbs of carbon are used/created by cargo vessels?
1111 2018-07-17 21:28:37 A lot of other countries already stopped buying oil from Iran after threat of US financial pressure from the Trump admin, incl India.
1112 2018-07-17 21:28:35 Get the mazda3 I put like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and literally didn't have to do anything but change the oil plus it's hella fun to drive and really safe
1113 2018-07-17 21:28:30 my bike definitely needs some oil there’s so much resistance going up hills i’m dead
1114 2018-07-17 21:28:28 We made a 4000%mg oil today lol. 2g of thc and 2g of cbd in a vial of grapeseed oil. The guy we made it for has rheumatoid arthritis and it helped him goodly lol
1115 2018-07-17 21:28:25 Trump criticized Germany for giving billions to Russia for the pipeline...he said Germany was making Russia rich. Trump then told Putin at their meeting that US gas and oil companies will be competing against Russia on the world stage. Doesn’t sound like collusion at all.

1117 2018-07-17 21:28:05 I don’t know that there actually is a movement or not but I grew up in Michigan and I find it completely bizarre that Alaska finds a way to make the oil royalties bankroll their state gov and also pay dividends to Alaskans we don’t have clean water in Flint.  #makenestlepay
1118 2018-07-17 21:28:04 Wouldn't it be something if Popeye's Chicken was fried in olive oil?
1119 2018-07-17 21:27:57  just trying eat some chicken and Alfredo while i get a baby oil massage! 
1120 2018-07-17 21:27:57 Last night, I was just living my best life, thriving and moisturizing, slathering myself in coconut oil, and the next thing you know, I’m trapped in the bathroom for ten minutes because I’m too damn slippery to turn the doorknob.
1121 2018-07-17 21:27:52 So Jim Pattinson be in surrey has the worst service department. I was told they would do a wheel alignment on my next service- show up and the equip is broken- no call- no apology over 6 hours and not finished an oil change! FML
1122 2018-07-17 21:27:45 Just see how stupid this guy can be 
1123 2018-07-17 21:27:33 This woman ur mumu is unequal. ICC will invite an African leader just for entertainment? Watch out what will happen after his term. So many suits waiting for him unless he use oil well licenses renewal next year to bribe his way. Or u think french president came here for holiday?
1124 2018-07-17 21:27:32 "Extra virgin olive oil... just like Grayson."

1127 2018-07-17 21:27:02 Jason Statham covered in oil on my tv. Go on then 
1128 2018-07-17 21:26:58 It has been one week since I've eaten pasta. I'm also not sure that I've encountered olive oil in England this week. #thingsImissaboutItaly
1129 2018-07-17 21:26:37 Plastic comes from oil. That's a rich and powerful lobby behind it. Straws are the first step to getting all plastic waste banned. As someone who needs straws, the ableism claims are technically true, but mostly overblown (and conveniently leave out biodegradable plastic straws.)
1130 2018-07-17 21:26:36 Ridiculous. Didn’t Obama say “Cut it out”? And resulted in nothing. Trump is Strong against Russia by 1) drilling for oil since that’s their main export, 2) supply Ukraine w/ weapons, force NATO to upgrade 3) attack Syria forces
#SubstanceOverStyle
1131 2018-07-17 21:26:34 Coconut oil does a cracking job
1132 2018-07-17 21:26:26 .
Putin does not let EU and USA rape Russia for it's resources.

Annoying, I know. 

Especially to share holders in Western oil companies.

But still, there's plenty of Middle East countries for Western interests to rape.

1134 2018-07-17 21:25:54 Oh my.
1135 2018-07-17 21:25:47 love having to return my audi for a different car due to oil consumption problems 
1136 2018-07-17 21:25:45 If its FSO in a glass syringe, I'd stick to 1 or 2 drops. If its the cbd oil you buy with a dripper lid, then the same til you find what works. Neither will leave him 'stoned', just, as you say, less anxious.
1137 2018-07-17 21:25:35 Lets try not to wake up before noon I should have done an RCT and literally only 3 actually looked at the farm there's baby chicks  I'm really terrified of bothering people Got oil paint all over my phone very confused.
1138 2018-07-17 21:25:25 @petsuppliesplus I wish you guys carried CBD oil for dogs. I'll just have to go to Chuck and Don's I guess instead.
1139 2018-07-17 21:25:22 I should really go home and workout outside. Right after this stupid oil change 
1140 2018-07-17 21:25:19 Waiting in #PepBoys 2 get my oil changed............at least it's FREEZING in here and I luv the smell in mechanic shops, go figure!!!!
1141 2018-07-17 21:25:18 How much oil do you need to add to the peanut butter to be able to even dip them?
1142 2018-07-17 21:25:11 I like the oil Release by YL -- I use with clients sometimes when I do my #Innerchildhealing  and #Pastliferegression
1143 2018-07-17 21:24:58 You are definitely getting mixed reviews.  I am VERY glad it DOESN’T contain PALM OIL.  I had to stop purchasing your coffee creamer, for that reason.  Anyone who has witnessed the ravaging of BORNEO, in the name of PALM OIL, will understand.
1144 2018-07-17 21:24:49 put too much damn oil on my head 
1145 2018-07-17 21:24:48 Tullow Oil threatens to shut down its operations in Turkana in the next two weeks if standoff with local community is not resolved.
1146 2018-07-17 21:24:46 man weird thing but i’m so happy i put a nighttime oil serum into my skincare routine like it makes my skin so glowy and even though i have oily skin it clears it so well and makes it so soft wow 10/10

1149 2018-07-17 21:24:11 The same EU countries who are beholden to Russia and it's oil? The same ones Trump chastised for not spending the money they agreed to in order to protect themselves from Russia?
The same ones doing business with Iran?
Do tell. 
1150 2018-07-17 21:23:57 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities." ~Psalms 141:5 #Jesus #God #Bible
1151 2018-07-17 21:23:38 Podcast listening today, yin and yang. Rough Translation’s “Austenistan” was share-worthy. And then I listened to Reveal’s latest, about the Trump admin f*cking over birds and wildlife for corporate oil profits and . #trypod
1152 2018-07-17 21:23:31 We should get ready to put offensive cyber measures in place and blow the hell out of Russian systems if they touch us. Shutting down their oil rigs, refineries and pipelines would wake that smirking bastard up. You think Russian capabilities are strong? Not even close to the US.

1155 2018-07-17 21:23:11 If Trump is a Russian agent, he's the worst one ever. Trying to force Germany to cancel its Russian oil contracts; demanding NATO to up their spending to curb Putin; severe sanctions on Russia. Yep, he must be an agent, your logic is stunning as usual.
1156 2018-07-17 21:23:08 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven...they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?
1157 2018-07-17 21:23:04 Wonder what oil she Huffed ! 
1158 2018-07-17 21:23:01 Coconut oil badly dries out my very coarse hair. Good luck.

1165 2018-07-17 21:22:01 Thank you for your suggestions!  Olive oil and heirloom tomatoes it will be since it is tomato season and I love them!  :-)
1166 2018-07-17 21:21:34 The oil is sold by Private companies;  it is not a nationalised resource; So "Scotland" gets Taxes based on transactions ; dependent on the Duty rules - but neither Scotland nor UK gets any "cut" of the inter-company sales price.
1167 2018-07-17 21:21:30 Baby oil 
1168 2018-07-17 21:21:30 I need an oil change so maybe I’ll work from home Friday
1169 2018-07-17 21:21:29 Hey Alex, instead of whining like a big baby, why not use the millions you make from infowhores snake oil to set up your own echo chamber?
1170 2018-07-17 21:21:20 Sorry I'm late! Busy day interviewing #bedfordindies for the August / September issue and tomorrow we start planning #smallbizSaturday and Christmas. I'll try harder next week ;-) #indiehour
1171 2018-07-17 21:21:14 — it’s also frustrating that people are focusing only on this that make disabled lives easier or even safer. Like let’s start to dismantle oil companies and focus on sustainability in farming and agriculture while thinking of solutions that benefit all, not just the majority
1172 2018-07-17 21:20:56 Trump already blew the damage control idea. What are you all so affraid of? He is just an old snake oil salesman.
1173 2018-07-17 21:20:54 I need to stop being so lazy about getting my oil changed 
1174 2018-07-17 21:20:52 Should've Got An Oil Change Today
1175 2018-07-17 21:20:42 actually getting freaked out getting ads for CBD oil on my instagram after listening to @Rubberbandits podcast

DJI keeps on pushing on up again 55points to 25119 
US Oil slightly down over night but putting a bad weekly also .4% 30c $67.58
1177 2018-07-17 21:20:31 Seriously? He’s basically an oil salesman at this point.
1178 2018-07-17 21:20:26 Indy Scotland will take theincome from the oil not WM. AndShould IMHO like the Saudi’s in 1973 take back ownership from the private exploiters.

1180 2018-07-17 21:20:06 ....and then the bell goes off and I remember that I need to get the fry basket out of the oil before I burn everything again.
1181 2018-07-17 21:20:02 you should give an opportunity for cbd oil from ag hemp to be otc on a fast track if you a really are going enforce that unconstitutional ind preclusion case.  that gets you out of the public is failed conundrum.
1182 2018-07-17 21:19:49 Motor oil?
1183 2018-07-17 21:19:30 That's a truly disgusting amount of oil.
1184 2018-07-17 21:19:25 "Chick-fil-A's peanut oil suppliers use a complex process to purify the oil. This refining process removes the protein from the peanut oil that triggers an allergic reaction. ... “But, we never tell customers concerned about peanut allergies to just go ahead and eat our food."
1185 2018-07-17 21:19:22 I think you got distracted by a Trump rabbit. Iran is under siege in terms of oil, currency, protests and military. Trump and Putin affirmed a commitment to the security of Israel. A lot has happened in the last 24 hours.
1186 2018-07-17 21:19:17 It's probably time to just step away from the computer when you realize you've been researching which oil is best for roasting vegetables for the last hour and have 14 safari tabs open.

1191 2018-07-17 21:18:46 Only if it involves other libs. If they don’t remember what happened with conservatives, they just make it up
1192 2018-07-17 21:18:41 Go vegetarian that helped me. Also cbd oil is clutch
1193 2018-07-17 21:18:38 not the olive oil guts

Caught lying, caught in contempt of court, caught being entirely inept in court. There has never been an explanation of it
1200 2018-07-17 21:17:50 Sometimes people who are allergic to peanuts can eat food that have been fried in peanut oil.

1202 2018-07-17 21:17:42 Can anyone remind me again how much the benchmark for oil is in the 2018 budget? 
Oil is now selling for $72/barrel.
What is happening to the excess amount????????
1203 2018-07-17 21:17:41 Yes, palettes of cash, delivered in the middle of the night on unmarked planes ....always the way money is transferred from one country to another. Absolutely !What could we questioning about this image?

1205 2018-07-17 21:17:32 Don't confuse Tax Revenue & the Economic GDP figures.

Tankers of Oil heading out of UK are sales by Private Companies that contribute to GDP calculations.  But there is NO tax duty payable on those exports.
1206 2018-07-17 21:17:30 Probably motor oil. She keeps running her mouth!
1207 2018-07-17 21:17:09 Oil and the contract to rebuild what we blew up! Bush and bin Laden's brother were partners in the rebuilding of it! What other country goes to war, then rebuilds it? THEY MADE BIG $. Unless of course that's a conspiracy 2!? Lol!
1208 2018-07-17 21:17:06 Obama is far more skilled and refined than either of the Clintons. He does have the ability to far surpass the financial success and impact of either one. Bill was good, but Obama blows him away.
1209 2018-07-17 21:16:58 Even if it's a 10% chance no one is saying we must stop using oil. We aren't going to destroy our economy to force us to go green. It's just in case we destroy the planet. The risk of being wrong on this is crazy huge. Hedging bets on survival is smart
1210 2018-07-17 21:16:54 Funny how when it’s Liverpool spending , justified with PL income, TV rights, Player sales, commercial deals, CL, History, a “Salah tax” (whatever the hell that is) but When City spend, its Oil money and we’ve bought the league.

1228 2018-07-17 21:14:14 Don’t understand why Firestone feels the need to completely readjust my seat every time I get my oil changed. Like you’re in the truck for 30 seconds max you don’t need to get all comfy lmao

Totally up for recipe ideas. My vegetarian Aunt would be proud.

1233 2018-07-17 21:13:42 This is because the natural swing of the neocon axe goes where the oil is. Russia has vast reserves, the US sees this as a threat to their perceived but very shaky wealth. They have become hysterical with their bogeyman Putin story. If only they would think for themselves

You'd better invest in coconut oil. By the actual fuckton.
1236 2018-07-17 21:12:41 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to the Boston Redsox. I'll get a good price!
1237 2018-07-17 21:12:40 Sure we buy more. It’s part of the American way. Haha. But the EU does not have fair trade with the US. 

We only want fair trade. Cut some tax. Have Germany and others buy natural gas and oil from the USA instead of Russia. That should lower the deficit and make most happy.
1238 2018-07-17 21:12:36 For skin: In addition to the charcoal masks im loving rn ; get the skin of a fruit ( eg water melon) and put 4 drops of tea tree oil on the fruit skin and apply to your face ....... it does wonders
1239 2018-07-17 21:12:32 The old Tru Truf rollers never had the seat cut out switch only the newer ones with the handbrake on them. What sometimes causes the machine to cut out is the motor oil sensor if you are on a good slope or if the oil level is low. For any tech support contact me direct.
1240 2018-07-17 21:12:27 Help to fill a container! Oil is what you need.  #ipad #ipadgames #gameinsight
1241 2018-07-17 21:12:25 The US has more "known" oil and producation capabilities than OPEC, US is now a net exporter of oil & gasoline. US gas prices are fixed & unrelated to supply, Fed & State gov't via gas taxes could care les,s as as price of gas in US goes up, gov't rakes in more money.
1242 2018-07-17 21:12:17 poor dear there can be issues with THCA (natural stable state of THC) causing nausea. Maybe if a high CBD flower or straight CBD oil? girl if anyone deserves something to take the edge off If not your thing can you PLZ do a vid with Milk’s weed mascara & fuck w the haters?
1243 2018-07-17 21:12:01 "Extra virgin olive oil, just like @GraysonDolan " LMAO that was a good one E

1245 2018-07-17 21:11:40 Liberals don’t even see the economic sense in building pipelines from western Canada to Ontario and Quebec. The Liberals would sooner see oil loaded on tankers in the middle east and shipped across the Atlantic and up the freshwater gulf and river of The St Lawrence .
1246 2018-07-17 21:11:36 So I now have at least 4 new Magic oil paintings I'll be showing off next year. :)
1247 2018-07-17 21:11:34 8 days ago, I took my crochet out and 2 days after that I drenched it in coconut oil, put my hair in a bun and kept it moving. 8 days later, I’m just now washing my hair. Don’t judge me.
1248 2018-07-17 21:11:29 Now he swimming in the oil
1249 2018-07-17 21:10:55 Nie można też zapominać, że rolę dzisiejszej Zatoki Perskiej jeśli chodzi o ropę naftową pełniła Rosja i zagłębie naftowe w Baku. Bylo ono konkurencją dla interesów Rockeffelera - Standard Oil itd. szeroko rozumianej Wall Street. Lew Trocki tuż przed Rewolucją był w Nowym Jorku.

1252 2018-07-17 21:10:27 Greg Gutfeld NAILED it with his opening monologue on #TheFive today:

If Trump is a Russian "plant", he's the worst there ever was.

Trump got: 
More NATO $
Called out German $ going to Russia for oil
Expelled Russian diplomats

All of these acts are detrimental to #Russia.

1254 2018-07-17 21:10:16 Longest oil change in my life 
1255 2018-07-17 21:10:15 Do you not realize that this so called tax cut wasn’t really a tax cut when the gas, produce, oil and steel have all went up so I see NO TAX CUTS! Because of this all so called tax money goes to paying all of these higher prices, are you all really that ignorant in the WH?
1256 2018-07-17 21:10:14 Norway. I'd like you to interview local people on how their oil fund has benefited them personally. And why can't Scotland have that.

1261 2018-07-17 21:09:44 Cheney has closed door meetings with big Oil and Iraq gets invaded soon after and all its oil taken, wonder who gets invaded next?
1262 2018-07-17 21:09:40 Warm water or mineral oil works but is slow. If that fails and you want fast results,  walk in clinic should be able to flush ears out with warm water.
1263 2018-07-17 21:09:40 Girl, you should have heard the conversation I overheard when I was in Montana a few weeks ago dropping my mom's car off for an oil change...talking about how it was a disgrace that women don't take their husband's last names, how global warming isn't real....
1264 2018-07-17 21:09:36 Hey if anyone has ever used oil sticks (not oil pastels it’s different) please let me know I wanna get into them
1265 2018-07-17 21:09:21 We damn sure don't need any oil or natural gas from Russia Trump bragged we're the leading oil & Natural Gas producer if they would just slow down production and sell it all in America that would solve our energy problem! We could lessen the need for oil with solar and wind ETC

1270 2018-07-17 21:08:42 Getting an oil change rn 
lil girl looking at a magazine: “mom look this lady has so many freckles. Like it’s too many.” 
Her mom:”well I think everyone is beautiful just the way they were” 
Her:”well it’s too many” 
Meanwhile I’m over here with 10000 freckles on my face
1271 2018-07-17 21:08:40 The oil it leaaaaking... I should be home sleeping
1272 2018-07-17 21:08:23 How many onions you go use sef fry four eggs? Pepper? Oil? Chai in this buhari economy?
1273 2018-07-17 21:08:18 I opened it up to get some olive oil and she ran in!
1274 2018-07-17 21:08:05 To be perfectly honest and rational, what is the difference between an Obama follower and a Bushiri follower? Nothing. They both believe that they can and will be elevated through the "man" and hang onto his every word, their gospel. Great orators, snake oil salesmen, the lot.
1275 2018-07-17 21:07:53 Puting oil to side you are saying that the country that modernised medicine communications and transport could not survive independently.
1276 2018-07-17 21:07:53 So you wanted a war with Russia? Is that what we needed to do? Asking for clarity. And how does 45 wanting better ties w R justify berating Germany for establishing better ties by entering into a commerce agreement for oil. Seems conflicted
1277 2018-07-17 21:07:52 Hi Michael, it's about the US Oil Companies selling gas to Germany, taking over the Market
1278 2018-07-17 21:07:44 However, getting enough calories can be a problem. It is a common mistake to not eat enough calories on a plant based diet.

To the fish-oil: fish oil has a lot of DHA and EPA, coconut oil dosn't have DHA nor EPA. You can use alge oil, that has EPA and DHA.
1279 2018-07-17 21:07:42 My scented oil diffuser smells like feet. I'm guessing you're supposed to clean these things now and then, or maybe someone added foot oil to mine.
1280 2018-07-17 21:07:40 Arrived home after a looong day to find son cooking himself stir fried mackerel, leaving the kitchen coated in a fine spray of mackerel infused oil & rushed up to his bedroom with a stinking bowl of food before I could bellow ‘at the table’ #Ismelllikeafishwife
1281 2018-07-17 21:07:38 Expands NATO

Delivers bigger sanctions on Russia then Obama ever did.
Wasn't caught in off Mic moment telling Russian President ill have more flexibility after the election. 
Good try comrade
1282 2018-07-17 21:07:23 White vinegar, fish sauce, sriracha, garlic, and soy sauce brought to a simmer in a small pan.
Eggplant, bamboo shoots, baby corn, and peanuts sauteed.
Tofu fried in peanut oil.
Al dente cooked noodles.

Mix everything in the same pan and serve with cabbage, carrots, and sprouts
1283 2018-07-17 21:07:21 Added new funding for US military

Encouraged domestic oil and gas exploration 

Persuaded Gulf Arabs to produce more to keep gas prices down
1284 2018-07-17 21:07:15 So I changed my gmas oil today and went to wash my hands and grabbed some soap...
I used oil... to wash oil...
1285 2018-07-17 21:07:08 With oil
1286 2018-07-17 21:06:45 This is my favorite lip exfoliating recipe :)
- 3 tbsp sugar
-1 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 tsp of cinnamon 
-1/4 tsp of vanilla extract (if you want)
- in my opinion EOS doesn’t moisturize my lips so I use...
- Burt’s Bee’s
-Vaseline 
- coconut oil
1287 2018-07-17 21:06:42 Ope looks like I’m never going back to get it now. So hopefully one of the secretaries thinks there’s weed oil in there and takes it home to catch a placebuzz
1288 2018-07-17 21:06:38 Unlike Trump,  Obama carefully considers every word, especially without a script. He is a master at this. Nobody is better in delivering the socialist globalist one world message than he is. I give him credit on that.
1289 2018-07-17 21:06:36 Just had a friend message me and let me know the CBD oil is already helping her and she just started using it.  I love getting those kind of messages!  #thecbdyouneed #hempworx — feeling excited
1290 2018-07-17 21:06:30 I use Black soap and Tissue oil with Shea butter , at times it may be how harsh you are with your skin and what you use to wash it
1291 2018-07-17 21:06:29 ALSO:

What was the arrangement for the trip to Scotland last weekend, when you took a Trump plane full of “businessmen” to golf with the President.  

Were they all trying to build towers in Russia?
Get in on Russian oil deals?
Or was it a make-a-wish trip for dying CEO’s?

They MUST BE PRESERVED untouched in perpetuity for the enjoyment of all generations.  Not taped for short term profiteering by a few
1297 2018-07-17 21:06:03 In oil exploration the lack of any dry holes shows risk aversion.
1298 2018-07-17 21:05:56 You guys throwing around “treason” need a dictionary. Upping the spending of NATO, increasing ZuS military spending, urging Germany not to buy Russian oil, etc. would make him the worlds most milquetoast “traitor”  #MAGA
1299 2018-07-17 21:05:55 Coconut oil saves lives and long locks
1300 2018-07-17 21:05:49 Uh oh, @DynamicWebPaige is warning us a bit of an environmental perspective may creep into our #oscon #tensorflowday presentation discussing her previous career in the oil industry. 
1301 2018-07-17 21:05:47 I GOT SO SCARED, I just got my oil changed and they told me I had a big coolant leak and I was super worried about an expensive fix before my move, but it turns out it's just a little cheap plastic stopper over an overflow valve that's popped
1302 2018-07-17 21:05:40 Last, only around 50% of oil goes to fuel internal combustion engines. The rest goes into things like carbon fiber to make wind turbine blades, clothing, makeup, plastics, and many of the things you use EVERY DAY. 

Pick your battles logically.

1309 2018-07-17 21:04:36 Can't remember the article that said the Nigerian government doesn't need its citizens and that's why it's not really enforcing its tax laws. Its money is being stolen from oil.

1318 2018-07-17 21:03:50 i really don’t have any clue why they show me everything when i get an oil change i have no idea what they’re talking about
1319 2018-07-17 21:03:47 What a productive day!  Got a small part on my car fixed (Fuel Door button relay), oil change & tire rotation at AutoFarm Ford-Lincoln, and settled on a frame with Tom Partridge at the Pear Tree Gallery for my certificates and the Key to the City.  
1320 2018-07-17 21:03:40 Incomplete information given to explain why he has said in most cases by you.  Trudeau was back stabbing, EU was cheating by not paying their 2%.  Germany was called out for buying oil from Putin but paying us only 1.24% just to name a few.
1321 2018-07-17 21:03:36 Global infrastructure relies on oil. While I agree that needs to change, it will take generations to come to fruition. The US infrastructure relies on oil. Without it, our economy will fail. We can either get it here or from foreign sources. The left have a problem with both...

1323 2018-07-17 21:03:17 Sure Dude, the russians want an America capable of defending itself from invasion. Next you're going to write the Sauds want us to stop buying oil.
1324 2018-07-17 21:03:10 2010 kick-started some serious entrepreneurial spirit & cottage industries. Individually, they won't bring in the coin that oil & gas does, but does anybody think there's the potential for finding a balance where we're not putting all our eggs in 1 basket?
1325 2018-07-17 21:03:08 Now this one I actually know, it's the burnt bits of chicken coating sieved out of the oil when the fryers are drained, mixed with water & a thickening agent  100% genuine, worked in one, made the stuff myself, tastes great but rank how they make it & REALLY bad for you
1326 2018-07-17 21:03:03 Unlike the prediction that all Scots wld be rich bcse of Oor oil (As in"Rich! RICH!!!RICHHHHHH!!!Ah tells ye") made in Sept 2014.Quite a few may not be around to see if this one proves accurate.

1364 2018-07-17 20:59:08 The snake oil salesman said it numerous times.  Went on about the witch hunt and how it is an embarrassment.    Try as he may...you can not get the toothpaste back into the tube.  He is lying only due to the reaction.
1365 2018-07-17 20:59:04 @realDonaldTrump Was anything said to Putin regarding sanctions being lifted and if so what the conditions would be to allow that to happen?  And was anything said about gas and oil going to NATO countries?  Is there more opportunity that the U.S. can compete with Russia on that?
1366 2018-07-17 20:58:59 Snake oil award goes to... Rudy Giuliani.
1367 2018-07-17 20:58:56 @KevinSMcArthur Check our what shutting down the oil sands will accomplish on a global scale.
1368 2018-07-17 20:58:51 And you stay looking like you've been bathed in shea butter and had your hair loc-d with coconut oil. Fucking shit
1369 2018-07-17 20:58:48 I'm now at Oil Ocean in Encore mode. Emerald count still zero :p I'm gonna laugh so hard if this zone's boss is even harder now (tbh Encore mode is generally harder than Mania mode) just for all the people who cried that it was "too hard" in the first place lol #SonicManiaPlus
1370 2018-07-17 20:58:47 Also buy - i don’t know what its called actually- a bottle of oil which is used afterwards bc whats left from the wax doesn’t go with water that easily!
1371 2018-07-17 20:58:47 Without the terrorist attacks in France, I did not have in mind the issue of martyrs in the social network, because I always knew about the great arms and oil business in the USA, so when the towers fell, I knew it was a great outrage, but ...
1372 2018-07-17 20:58:43 @cnnbrk @ABCNews @CBSNews @NBCNews @SNLUpdate Boris Badenov, Oil Can Harry, The Frog & Harry, Oswald Cobblepot, Vlad the Impaler, Vladimir Putin...any questions?  #BadPresident #sad
1373 2018-07-17 20:58:38 People who work in BC and Alberta oil industry/distribution have much to lose if oil companies begin to export the majority of their bitumen to Asian market. Diminishing supply for BC.
1374 2018-07-17 20:58:20 I've been trying out shea moisture black jamaican castor oil hair gel. Its been working. But its not a 10/10 like eco styler for me. More like an 8... But its good enough.
1375 2018-07-17 20:58:16 Good girl!!! My nutritionist had me put in 1-2 tbsp of flax seed oil. Has good fats in it that take down inflammation help with joint pain & dry eye, it is a healthy fat. I promise you don’t even taste it. U want a good quality one that has to be refrigerated
1376 2018-07-17 20:58:15 Think I’m going to try oil mines get so ruined on holiday need them out asap 
1377 2018-07-17 20:58:08 I finished that. Breaking Bad is next. Just waiting for dinner to finish. Also need to help around the house too before being able watch. If we get a build tomorrow (and it should happen because of what I stated), me thinks a ride to 66.50 town is possible.
1378 2018-07-17 20:57:59 A whole cup of oil seems like a lot.
1379 2018-07-17 20:57:55 he prolly talkin bout oil
1380 2018-07-17 20:57:54 This is what a Russian mole would do. 
1. Limit fracking
2. Block oil and gas pipelines
3. Cut U.S. military spending
4. Reduce tensions with Iran

Oh, that's right...Obama did all those things. Trump undid them.
1381 2018-07-17 20:57:39 Yep and oil
1382 2018-07-17 20:57:37 Even Jay Z told y'all that "Obama will blow up your whole hood if you have oil under it"
1383 2018-07-17 20:57:33 While suing a cartel for ... being a cartel seems to make sense, any (unlikely) gas price relief would be temporary, as is oil.
1384 2018-07-17 20:57:17 It was really scare a bit of oil splashed over the side and woosh the whole ring and pan whent up.
1385 2018-07-17 20:57:16 hold on so this shit burn so i think you should just choose either lemon juice or tea tree oil
1386 2018-07-17 20:57:14 I HATE ORGALUTRAN!!! my suggestion, because I found out after my first few shots that it’s oil based not water based, which is why it stings afterwards is to ice your belly 10 mins before and 10 minutes after. It really helped! Good luck hun x
1387 2018-07-17 20:57:09 .. I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
1388 2018-07-17 20:57:08 GIRL GO GET YOUR OIL CHANGED
1389 2018-07-17 20:57:05 Do you want some tips of how to make it?
If you bought the ones in a can,do this
1. open it(CAREFULLY!ITS EXTREMELY SHARP!)
2. Grab a sieve
3. Put the sardine in it and wait until it's without oil
4. Wash the sardines
5. Put some oil in the frying pan
6. Put the sardine
7. Done!
1390 2018-07-17 20:56:56 There seems to be a shift in thought about tech companies. I imagine there are people within the EU and America suggesting the likes of Google and Facebook be broken apart similar to standard oil due to their monopoly on data
1391 2018-07-17 20:56:55 I drive a lot, getting oil changed, serpentine belt was pretty cracked-getting new one.
1392 2018-07-17 20:56:54 Good to know thank you for that. He mostly likes crunching on the toasted edges so not much oil butter or garlic just French bread crust 
1393 2018-07-17 20:56:44 Coconut oil is life. 

Dry/damaged hair? Coconut oil. 
Chub rub? Coconut oil. 
Need a night mask/moisturiser?  Coconut oil. 
Want whiter teeth? Coconut oil. 
Skin infection/irritation? 

You get the gist. It’s fkn fab 
1394 2018-07-17 20:56:44 Flash sale ends tonight! Free dry shampoo when you enroll as VIP. Free REJUVENIQUE oil when you enroll as MP. DM me.
1395 2018-07-17 20:56:39 Raven oh Raven – You clean the air at work,
And helped my muscles that time I tried to twerk.
You come in so handy with all my snot
I hope in my life without you I am never caught,
Hmm, that’s all I’ve got.
I use Raven essential oil for help with muscles and breathing and more!
1396 2018-07-17 20:56:33 How about cancelling gas and oil subsidies while we’re at it? I’d be more than glad to sign that along with no subsidized EVs. The true cost of fuel will cause mass adoption of EVs
1397 2018-07-17 20:56:24 Oil and water! 
1398 2018-07-17 20:56:12 Oh, the bahi sunflower sweets oil works well too.
1399 2018-07-17 20:55:55 I said the mass murdering, Putin loving oil thief not the porn brothers. I’ve got a limit 
1400 2018-07-17 20:55:48 I do facial scrubs every day and coconut oil is all I put on my face. My shit just refuses to grow
1401 2018-07-17 20:55:47 No donnie you can’t peddle that snake oil here.
1402 2018-07-17 20:55:42 SSUNDEE ok so you know your massive oil farm I found a much more valuable and common resource its a green crystal called erudian I it sells for 233 block bucks its INSANE I made 20,000 in like 5-10 minutes also I dont need a shout out I just want to help you break the GAME thanks
1403 2018-07-17 20:55:34 Yes! Buy the capsules, as long as they are in a darker jar (or even a white jar.) Calendula is always diluted with another oil. Depending on your natural/health foods store, you can buy neem oil straight or diluted in an ointment.
1404 2018-07-17 20:55:34 I like the french Canadian version of a hand rolled cigarette stuffed with good full melt ice water bubble hash ... but has to be low heat pressed to bust the trichs to oil and frozen fresh after ...    LOL   I spent a lil time in Montreal .. and that is one habit I acquired
1405 2018-07-17 20:55:21 So how did she do that, sold off publicly owned assets, for a pittance, and milked Scottish Oil revenues. All of today's problems stem from the day the Tories were taken over by #financecapital, and the CBI were binned
1406 2018-07-17 20:55:18 *Man city signs player for 1billion in 2020*

Everyone: Ah there’s the Arab oil money back at it again
1407 2018-07-17 20:55:16 You should watch more curb your enthusiasm  good tweet!
1408 2018-07-17 20:55:11 Today a dog on fish oil capsules popped one of his little pills and shot the contents all over me
1409 2018-07-17 20:55:04 How long are you fan? How can you say we’re not growing? Considering the amount of money we spend the young talents and manager we doing fine. We’re a football club who breath football not a Arab or Russian oil toy Audere Est Facere.
1410 2018-07-17 20:54:54  nah I definitely feel you. You gotta use coconut oil and face scrubs. 9/10 ya pores ain’t open enough fottta keep em clean
1411 2018-07-17 20:54:31 Cantu or Ruutos, organic coconut oil, castor oil, dark n Lovely..  start with Cantu, it’s amazing.
1412 2018-07-17 20:54:29 Better than with greasy oil!
1413 2018-07-17 20:54:17 The best thing about this whole spectacle is how pathetic both Trump & Putin come off & how it provides opportunity to put Russia’s global insignificance in perspective. Your economy only slightly larger than NY state. U have nothing but  oil to offer. Your ‘democracy’ is a sham.
1414 2018-07-17 20:54:16 My momma ran out the door tb she goin to get a oil change... an hour later she on ig posted wit her nigga takin pics inna bathroom ..  fuck she lyin for like she 16 ah sum  lil sneaky mfa 
1415 2018-07-17 20:54:08 The Russian Federation supplies a significant volume of fossil fuels and is the largest exporter of oil and natural gas to the European Union.

Next case.
1416 2018-07-17 20:54:01 If you go on google it would tell you the right ratio for the tea tree oil and witch hazel
1417 2018-07-17 20:54:00 Almost all studies on olive oil have to do with the Mediterranean diet & not directly olive oil.  If people sautee and have a dressing with olive oil, they consume around 2TBSP per day. That is an extra 240 calories and 28g of fat with few micronutrients.  Sorry, not health food.
1418 2018-07-17 20:53:53 Oil stew is becoming my fav and my G dey always deliver.i stopped making stew  months ago
1419 2018-07-17 20:53:50 He is a con man, snake oil salesman.  He says whatever is going to get him what he wants.
1420 2018-07-17 20:53:46 Hair growth is like its biggest benefit. It’s a great moisturizing oil and prevents dandruff. Good to thicken and strengthen your hair.
1421 2018-07-17 20:53:42 we better get sieg looking his most horny and percy with his shirt off rubbing oil on his (flat) tiddies if we're going to be on par with That Nonsense. helnar's whole schtick is being a horny fuckcatboi let him do that slow walk out of water w/ his swimsuit falling off or smth
1422 2018-07-17 20:53:32 TIPS! An issue with your engine may not necessarily mean it needs to be replaced. Typical signs include overheating and vast oil consumption. #RPM #jacksonville #florida #automotive
1423 2018-07-17 20:53:17 おはようございます～☆
今日はハードでしたよ。
帰ってゆっくり寝ます～
1424 2018-07-17 20:53:13 My original point was how much income to the UK treasury is raised on a Scottish sourced resource, the various oil sources are blended to suit refining needs but essentially either Scottish oil is used directly or exchanged for other source. Scot Indy Uk buys all its oil.
1425 2018-07-17 20:52:59 LOL okay. Mighty fucking destroys Oil Ocean act 2 boss
1426 2018-07-17 20:52:57 You’re not the only person who knows to change oil.
1427 2018-07-17 20:52:50 Yes, Cartesio decision is central to this as is Supreme Court's own Campus Oil decision.
1428 2018-07-17 20:52:49 Gun oil is my fav
1429 2018-07-17 20:52:27 Jamaican black castor oil, also regular exercise, water and a multivitamin with biotin
1430 2018-07-17 20:52:27 Miracle drops until it fully grows in. Then when it fully grows in cut it so it’ll grow thicker. Then use the Shea Moisture Conditioner & Jamaican Black Castor Oil & you’ll flourish 
1431 2018-07-17 20:52:19 Water wipes and coconut oil (if he isn’t allergic to coconut oil) water wipes you can find at target they’re 2/3$ and are literally the BEST. More than half of my babies use them.
1432 2018-07-17 20:52:07 I can’t imagine your thoughts on oil and gas. Ya probably have lunch weekly with Hollis French and discuss new ways to try and extort money from them to increase state spending huh?
1433 2018-07-17 20:52:07 We have to understand that @elonmusk is not only target from short sellers also some of these journalists could be working for big money oil and automakers companies. A long way to go.
1434 2018-07-17 20:52:04 Don’t worry! I know we’ve been quiet so far but I and @ECCESCA colleagues are burning the midnight oil to ensure the best of @Essex_CC social workers are represented as usual this year!  I am so proud of them all!
1435 2018-07-17 20:52:03 ready to get into crystals  and get me an oil diffuser
1436 2018-07-17 20:51:56 They should paint it like a NASCAR car with oil, pharma, defense and private prison company logos painted all the fuck over it.
1437 2018-07-17 20:51:48 Oil Polishing Stone
1438 2018-07-17 20:51:46 Wow we have a new kid let’s rush him. Forget Jones, Bear and Legasson. They are STILL developing but heck Bouchard Is a first rounder so let’s dump him on the fast track. If Bouchard is the ENTIRE fix to the PP then Oil are in deeper crap then I thought.
1439 2018-07-17 20:51:39 “4 out 5 eye dentists surveyed said they prefer Visine to motor oil for for patients with dry eyes.” 
1440 2018-07-17 20:51:32 She’s moisture deep conditioner. The Jamaican and castor oil one. I’ll send you a pic when i get up lol but i deep condition once a week and curls are ALLWAYS poppin after that
1441 2018-07-17 20:51:30 Try Majik Touch Hair Oil. It really works. Her IG is @majiktouch_
1442 2018-07-17 20:51:26 The wicked don't sleep while the noble toil and work the midnight oil. Both ends of the candle.
1443 2018-07-17 20:51:22 At Starbucks:
shoved lavender essential oil up my noise to destress from the hell that is Illinois certification...and I think the barista thinks I'm on cocaine.
1444 2018-07-17 20:51:22 Chris ordering a salad: “I’ll have a chicken salad without that gay shit on it”... he’s talking about oil dressing
1445 2018-07-17 20:51:19 Put the oil on me, put your hands on me, put your blessing on me...now baby take me down!!!
1446 2018-07-17 20:51:17 My mom straight up telling me how to do cannabis oil wtf
1447 2018-07-17 20:51:13 Special from our Garden #Stationhouseoflafayette!!!
Caprese Salad, fresh tomatoes, Mozzarella cheese and Basil leaves with olive oil and Balsamic reduction. And Tomatoes and Basil Bisque soup
1448 2018-07-17 20:51:02 Well today i was quoted as a X between Olive Oil (popeye) and a sumo wrestler 
1449 2018-07-17 20:51:00 “Not that it would be a crime if I did do it which I did ... not but anyway we’re making americagreatagaunjrhcjrmjsgedjnarglbargle”

1451 2018-07-17 20:50:43 Just watched a lady pour olive oil all over a cross walk. She then proceeded to laugh hysterically while waiting for people to slip crossing the street. a true creative in the arts of evil.
1452 2018-07-17 20:50:39 You know you've got an obsession when you go home to cook your rocks after cutting them so they don't smell like oil. #GeologyRocks
1453 2018-07-17 20:50:38 Friends what brand of tea tree oil do y’all use?
1454 2018-07-17 20:50:08 I mean...it was the assets of Iranian businesses that were going unclaimed, I believe. Like, for example, She’ll was restricted from paying Iranian oil companies for the oil they had already taken from them
1455 2018-07-17 20:50:06 Clove oil
1456 2018-07-17 20:50:04 Well,  once i had had a deep cut under my foot and hid it until my foot began to swell. When mum found out she put oil on red hot knife and into the wound.  By morning my leg wasas good as new. Now i know she sterilized the wound... #myloveformum
1457 2018-07-17 20:49:55 Try Full Spectrum Oil first. A 5ml glass syringe should cost no more than £30. One or two drops under the tongue is usually enough.
1458 2018-07-17 20:49:48 I reuse 2x always but never for Fish. No batter, 3 is max. And that is peanut oil. All I use, veg is stove top use.
1459 2018-07-17 20:49:48 Girls with fat asses always remember to oil that booty
1460 2018-07-17 20:49:46 Today while I waited for my oil change I went over to pv mall and looked at the puppies and that was a bad idea cause now I’m checking my credit score adding up some numbers contemplating my life for this mini dachshund 
1461 2018-07-17 20:49:24 @realDonaldTrump has more strength in his pinky finger than you have in your whole body.  Admit it! 
He’s Winning and the Dems are losing. #VoteDemsOut #WalkAway #TuesdayMotivation

1462 2018-07-17 20:49:22 LYING TRUMP ACCUSED GERMANY OF BEING HELD CAPTIVE TO RUSSIA FOR OIL & GAS PIPELINES-- YET TRUMP WANTS EXXON TO WIN A $500 BILLION OIL DEAL WITH RUSSIA--THE US WILL BE A TOTAL CAPTIVE TO RUSSIA & TRUMP WILL GET $80 BILLION SIGNING BONUS FROM RUSSIA---BIG CORRUPTION
1463 2018-07-17 20:49:08 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
1464 2018-07-17 20:49:04 Man it's hot enough to fry a 30LB turkey in 30 seconds outside. No oil no pot
1465 2018-07-17 20:48:49 Love to change your oil and gears in your blues, bet the cycling gear felt swell on your #booty and bulge xx 
1466 2018-07-17 20:48:46 Oh he's not half as stupid as you might think unfortunately . Ignorant yes.He's an opportunist : go back to the '73 oil embargo , when NY was on its knees . Trump got the banks to lend him money to buy up derelict buildings & turn them into hotels in exchange for paying 0 tax .
1467 2018-07-17 20:48:45 i need that! ive been having a problem with an oil bump that wont go away and lil acne all over my face finna save these ingredients. do you have specific measurements?
1468 2018-07-17 20:48:37 What's even more brutal? Trump deliberately backing out of the Iran deal and putting sanctions on Iran so that Russia would now profit greatly in the oil market. Three guesses as to why he did that...
1469 2018-07-17 20:48:21 With any Consumption Tax it becomes due at the time & location of the sale to end user. 

E.g.  HMRC receives same Tax on "Scottish" Oil ; Norwegian Oil or Middle East Oil, just as long as it is sold in UK as petrol.
1470 2018-07-17 20:48:19 Truck payment paid, oil/fluids changed, and about to wash the ole truck. Life is good
1471 2018-07-17 20:48:15 It could be unrelated though, it could be your back being out of alignment that is causing the pain. Soak in a nice hot bath with some epsom salt/foot soap/peppermint essential oil... All of those things help when u have soreness that u can home remedy. One more ;)
1472 2018-07-17 20:47:49 girlll. honey, lemon juice and a piece of tea tree oil, purified water AF because tea tree oil potent af and baking soda! it feels really good on my face rn.
1473 2018-07-17 20:47:40 Never trust a slick oil salesman

1475 2018-07-17 20:47:28 Yesterday many of us were attacked for expressing our rational view that Trump's performance was dismal. Trump clarified a portion of his speech & trolls are quiet. I will now point out, Trump agreed with Putin on Price Fixing of Oil in presser, Trump needs to be called on it.

1477 2018-07-17 20:47:23 I feel this on a personal level but with fryer oil burns
1478 2018-07-17 20:47:22 #Misspoke is "made a serious mistake" in politicianese. But whats the actual damage? What did Putin take home? A pic for the fam album? I sure hope now #Germany ends that insane gas n oil #pipeline around UA, BY, PL, LT, LV, EST. If not, they wl really be #supporting Putin.
1479 2018-07-17 20:47:22 Why can't the guy get the country with the biggest oil reserves in order?

1481 2018-07-17 20:46:54 After doing a sugar+coconut oil scrub, my face always feels so soft. I can never find store-bought scrubs that feel half as decent as ones you make.
1482 2018-07-17 20:46:50 @DArealBBJUDY go to her link. Its some oil that will help grow it out.
1483 2018-07-17 20:46:38 Fried food is hard to get food poisoning from, but easily get diarrhea from the oil.
1484 2018-07-17 20:46:37 I had a thought on this. I'm going to start carrying pepper spray everywhere. If I'm ever booted from an Uber due to politics, I'm going soak the seat in OC on my way out the door. Hard to drive when the car is making the driver snot, cry and choke.
1485 2018-07-17 20:46:34 Getting more oil revenue,  stable power supply,  ghs3.5b from ESLA,  capped all statutory funds by 25%, collected more taxes,  borrowed ghs37b more, built NOTHING...AND NPP WANTS TO INCREASE TAXES ?
1486 2018-07-17 20:46:20 How bout some olive oil for wanking. ??? And a good internet connection fr d other site?
1487 2018-07-17 20:46:15 Early night will be early. Even though I don’t have to work tomorrow, I feel like not burning the midnight oil is just what I need. Anyway, probably not gonna have a great time sleeping what with this infernal heat.
1488 2018-07-17 20:46:15 The people were conned into playing a game of find the lady with rigged deck of cards by a bunch of snake oil salesmen. We are left in limbo while the so called government masterbates itself to death. But who am I to complain?
1489 2018-07-17 20:46:10 I feel like I've heard this story before. Oh? Gold in the Black Hills, you say? Oil in Oklahoma?

1502 2018-07-17 20:44:18 Absolutely. When I use a necessary oil that doesn’t smell good then I put it on the bottom of my feet. This combo is easy on the nose!
1503 2018-07-17 20:44:16 Getting an oil change tomorrow @ the crack of ass on my day off. Over being an adult already
1504 2018-07-17 20:44:11 Glad I reread your tweet.   I wondered about the oil going rancid.  Thanks again
1505 2018-07-17 20:44:11 We need more modern nuclear power plants built in this state to power our grid. No more dirty gas and oil plants.
1506 2018-07-17 20:44:10 You are so kind to people, like me, who are not paying you. I just finished reading the Crude Volatility book. I sent a copy to a retired Mobil Oil physicist. I appreciate the education.

1508 2018-07-17 20:43:54 Nigeria largest oil producer in Africa = Nigerians gets the most visas to U.S & Europe.
Sudan, Chad & Somalia provide no vital resource to U.S = Travel ban from Sudan, Chad & Somalia.
Oil is discovered in Chad = Travel Ban lifted for Chad.

1509 2018-07-17 20:43:51 There’s a guy sitting next to me in a truck dealership while I’m waiting to get the oil changed in my pickup, and I just can’t get over how he’s wearing skinny jeans with cowboy boots....  I don’t care who you are you never do that.

1512 2018-07-17 20:43:30 @SecPompeo We say that Iran's oil exports will fall to zero, because we want to cut off the maximum Iranian oil, this is a tactic. Any amount that can be reduced by Iran's oil should go down to zero, even if it can be.
1513 2018-07-17 20:43:28 The centre can also be turned with an ordinary screwdriver. ‘Oil’ the lock with RP7 / WD40. Nah, the window! LOL ;-) You could have just sat there and started a book…O.k now I’m done…Have the best day Carlye.
1514 2018-07-17 20:43:23 That's what Venezuela said years ago...they were so arrogant.  They thought they could finance socialism with their oil.  How did that work out for them?
1515 2018-07-17 20:43:14 Easy question to ask but as the SNP were not in control of the council it's a mute point.  You have to remember the lack of funding over the years that allowed the schools to get in that state was when Labour & Tories controlled Westminster.  There was plenty of oil money mind!

1518 2018-07-17 20:42:51 Most of the "analysts" had builds of 3 million plus. Now we should see lower exports (OPEC is back at pumping baby!!!), normal imports, no new distillate demand, and MORE US oil production (this time weekly EIA should have us at above 11 million bpd). I smell builds :)

1528 2018-07-17 20:41:03 @SecPompeo We know that Iran's oil exports will not go up to zero, but it is enough for us not to be exempted from any sanctions. Even if China can circumvent sanctions, it's admirable that the United States has not exempted any country.

1539 2018-07-17 20:39:48 True, but ...... Putin needs Trump and the U.S.A. to bolster his stature.  There are some deals going down in regard to oil.  Trump will continue to do as Putin dictates; no doubt about it.  What are WE going to do about Trump is the question!
1540 2018-07-17 20:39:38 @JHahnEU As far as I know the highest profitable is 1. oil industry 2. Automobile sector 3. Turism. Soon your auto industry will suffer.

1541 2018-07-17 20:39:35 Beetje selectief winkelen in dat rapport. Er staat ook : The improved prospects for the US shale sector contrast with the rest of  the upstream oil and gas industry. Investment in conventional oil projects, which are responsible for the bulk of global supply, remains  subdued.
1542 2018-07-17 20:39:22 We need this one to also. See? He can't even do the job of a  snake oil salesman correctly! Sigh...
1543 2018-07-17 20:39:22 Yeah true.. I mean, some of these oil people were in debt because their kids were in BIS and all that. Meanwhile, the people at places I've worked since that have kids in schools like that are people that the company pays the kids school fees.
1544 2018-07-17 20:39:01 Yes I got a jar from boots about £2.50 its also good for dry skin too,its solid in the jar and turns to oil as u rub it in

1550 2018-07-17 20:38:33 You know your COG when you don’t have vegetable oil to cook with, so you grab a bottle of anointing olive oil to cook with. Lord, bless and multiple it, In Jesus name, Amen! #COGLife @totalCOGmove

I use hair mayonnaise to deep condition. 
3. OILS. Use natural oils. I use coconut oil and olive oil and placenta oil(Im not sure if placenta oil is natural)
1553 2018-07-17 20:37:08 And the price of oil had absolutely nothing to do with it. Take your ideological blinders off. The PCs left Alberta without any savings to weather the oil bust. Fact: AB is better off than SK and NL because of the NDP and was leading the country in economic growth. #ableg
1554 2018-07-17 20:37:07 i have bought and made use of tea tree oil
1555 2018-07-17 20:37:07 Definitely hair, not sure about skin. It’s a heavy oil so I think it would clog your pores if used on your skin.

1557 2018-07-17 20:36:56 Also US and Russia (+KSA) are the biggest of big carbon. Trump and Putin are active enemies of the energy transition. Timing of the EU/Japan trade deal highlights this divide: Asia, led by China, including Japan + India, and Europe v US, Russia, KSA. Transition v Oil...

1592 2018-07-17 20:33:06 You keep imposing all these sanctions on Russia. You might want to look at a history book. We thought we could put oil embargoes on Japan before WW2 Japan just turned and invaded China. So you rocket scientist keep poking the second largest Nuclear armed country

1612 2018-07-17 20:29:06 Once again though. If Canada could somehow reduce all carbon use, it wouldn't come close to the result if we can affect how the rest of the world pollutes.  There's still a massive demand for oil and gas, and we have the best product available. Capitalize and innovate.

How about giving freedom to #BIAFRANS?
1625 2018-07-17 20:26:55 #POTUS will not reveal his plan to the world in dealing with Putin.  Approach may be unorthodox but wait for results.  Did you hear Putin said he wants to work with the US to regulate gas and oil prices so prices would not drop so low that it would not be profitable.  Leverage!

1628 2018-07-17 20:26:37 I wonder how much of the fossil fuel investment is in Ponzi-esque "unconventional" gas & oil extraction schemes? More money being thrown down the bottomless wells to pay returns on previous investments.
1629 2018-07-17 20:26:31 How ironic considering Chevron has done more to harm indigenous peoples than any other oil company when it deliberately dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste in the Amazon over decades. #ChevronGuilty
1630 2018-07-17 20:26:12 What are the odds China's OBOR initiative will be a gigantic waste of resources plagued by delays and corruption, and equivalent to investing in the world's biggest oil lamp factory halfway into the adoption of light bulbs?

1643 2018-07-17 20:24:45 Yes, The Tyee is right, the Carbon Tax makes Frack LNG possible. So does the Yukon NDP vote from Dec. 2015 for the deceptively amended Oil & Frack Act, according to Prof. Tony Ingraffea's knowledgeable reading of the act. The act removed science base and frack obstacles in Yukon.

He has been harder on Putin than Obama, on whose watch the so called election interference happened!  Mueller via Rosenstein: no votes changed, no American involved.  Should we start a war?
1685 2018-07-17 20:19:24 The oil gas and leccy are all north of the border. That will concentrate minds.
1686 2018-07-17 20:19:07 Russia seems to be underdeveloped with a 1.+ trillion economy with oil being its main export.

1693 2018-07-17 20:18:48 Idk how much it costs to get an oil change for a car that’s worth a House but listen. I gotta get that shit before I lave this earth. Preferably while I’m young enough to enjoy it

1717 2018-07-17 20:15:49 We can work with Russia on issues  of mutual interests.

Fight radical Islam is a mutual interest.
Other issues we disagree on.

1755 2018-07-17 20:10:49 Cynic conclusion: oil biz is moving refining out of US and thinks price reduction in gasoline due to no fuel tax will increase consumption and thus their profits.
1756 2018-07-17 20:10:46 Ask your government why it stopped importing oil from Iran partially after @Potus threatened with sanctions? India is no Russia, it is still a third world country with a illiterate chaiwala ruling it.

1758 2018-07-17 20:10:34 The endgame isn’t Russia, it’s using Russia to leverage China due to oil and resource exports. But I don’t expect anyone on your side to understand any geopolitics.

1760 2018-07-17 20:10:12 Ta tatata  ! L'article precise bien qu'EDF ne table pas sur une baisse de l'electricite dans ses previsions, sinon elle fait faillite. Seule une tension avec un prix elevé peut justifier la construction de nouveau reacteur.
1761 2018-07-17 20:10:08 what about evgeni??? i just needs some caster oil too!
1762 2018-07-17 20:10:07 And when I was a child, and my great aunt (in Chesterfield) was displeased I had yet again left the door wide open, she would say, “Put wood in’t ‘oil.”  Obvs.

Otherwise N League economy manager were duffer and $ crossed Rs.160 in 2017.
1772 2018-07-17 20:09:09 China, Iran, Russia & many others do & always have. We still do business with many of them. No one has offered any solution other than sanctions, which won't work if they are allowed to sell oil to the west & all over the world. What else? War?

maybe I should have hidden the olive oil

1781 2018-07-17 20:08:09 the oil companies have spent a lot of money to tell you that, cause they're in trouble if it does.

1784 2018-07-17 20:07:58 Uhm, Trump is naming Germany an Enemy because of buying russian oil but he himself is the best buddy of Putin? Is this already some kind of dementia that this numbnut is talking like a 6yo?

1790 2018-07-17 20:07:00 They are, but they're still politicians. To me, being a Liberal Democrat MP at such an event is like a Green MP being an oil executive in their private life. It's a complete contradiction.
1791 2018-07-17 20:06:56 But the oil companies told me that climate change doesn't exist!
1792 2018-07-17 20:06:55 Right. Well they’d have to do this because they are buy most of their oil from Russia. So which is it? We’re for Germany and against Russia? Or Germany is for Russia and against the US? Catching any cognitive dissonance here?

1803 2018-07-17 20:06:03 I agree with every word he said. You are quite simple.Sanctions, closing facilities, expelling russians, arming Ukraine, killing Russian mercenaries in syria..yepp he is Russia first, calling Germany out buying Russian oil, getting NATO coffers built up LOL!!

1805 2018-07-17 20:05:57 the treaty in principle is a good idea. BUT Putin wants concessions ie easing of his sancitons (due to his ivasion of Crimea) or perhaps opening up of his oil & gas exports (same thing = sanctions) and this Trump cannot agree to. Putin is playing Trump
1806 2018-07-17 20:05:45 Yes, I'm sure Putin loves:
- the US bombing their bases and killing their mercenaries in Syria
- isolating Iran again
- Increasing US oil production
- eviction of Russian diplomats
- arming the Ukranians
- increasing NATO spending by getting other countries to spend more
1807 2018-07-17 20:05:43 Yeah. Suspected oil pressure switch fault, so gonna have to get that change. Don't like the angry looking warning light

1816 2018-07-17 20:04:53 Japan is pissed that Trump is demanding them to stop buying oil from Iran!!

Just because the USA pulls out of an agreement doesn’t mean you have to fuck up trade relations with the rest of the world economies!!

1820 2018-07-17 20:04:33 Listing Montana alongside Chanos & Spiegel puts him on a similar level to them. He’s not. Don’t give him that satisfaction. He hides behind anonymity to cloak how his pursuit of Tesla & Musk (which for him is clearly a full time job) is funded. It stinks of Big Oil & Big Auto
1821 2018-07-17 20:04:31 Felt kinda sleepy in a meeting today until the man I was meeting with told me about a proverb in his language: "You can pour oil on your body and roll around in sugar, and some sugar will stick." Really got me thinking.
1822 2018-07-17 20:04:21 While he handed weapons to his enemies in Ukraine and bombed his allies in syria, and called germany a puppet for using Russian oil? Trump does what's best for trump, and his base loves it when he makes you mad by being friendly with putin.

1826 2018-07-17 20:04:07 The oil will run out when exploration, at cost, fails to replenish reserves in line with extraction.  When the substitutes are cheaper tan the exploration, the oil will not be produced.. but that will only happen when the alternatives are at market, reliably supplied and priced.

Imposing heavy sanctions on the countries that are easing up the oil redemption for #Iran , ie. #China & #Russia , would definitely weaken the Mullahs and result in regional peace.

1829 2018-07-17 20:03:48 @BradWall306 addicted to oil much?
1830 2018-07-17 20:03:48 If South Africa  Gabon  and Nigeria  has exercised their vote differently at the UNSC perhaps brother leader would still be alive n Libyan oil n it’s infrastructure would’ve been spared. African leaders collaborated with Western terrorists to murder Gaddafi  -SAD!

1833 2018-07-17 20:03:19 It will never happen. The cities will not be able to provide substantial proof. To say nothing of the fact that most of the oil actually gets consumed in them as opposed to rural areas.

Only in nutty California would something like this ever even get off the ground.
1834 2018-07-17 20:03:11 Im an olive oil household so i get you
1835 2018-07-17 20:03:06 You seem to be a learned man so you must be knowing that no country has an independent economy and is governed by global trends. Now look back and see the global trends and world oil prices in that period. Thanks.
1836 2018-07-17 20:03:01 'extra virgin olive's oil just like grayson' i laughed so hard at this jskdkskx

1838 2018-07-17 20:02:57 I used vegetable oil in the skillet instead of butter & it happened

brush 2nd side with butter

1843 2018-07-17 20:02:02 So how do you feel about him telling Germany to stop getting their oil from Russia? Can't have it both ways.
1844 2018-07-17 20:01:58 when you said “ extra virgin oil just like grayson” it was like you were in a commercial or something 
1845 2018-07-17 20:01:56 Rapeseed  there’s a gorgeous chili & garlic infused olive oil in tescos 
1846 2018-07-17 20:01:33 He's right to be stern with you. You genuinely risk completely destroying engine driving with insufficient oil. To use a crude analogy. Would any sensible person even consider doing daily anal sex without lubrication. No. But yet we happily do this with our car engines.
1847 2018-07-17 20:01:30 "As indicated in my new book/blog." Where have we heard that before?

The pipeline will be able to carry whatever is put in it. It doesn't have to be dilbit, and could easily be refined oil in the future.

1857 2018-07-17 20:00:35 There's still a crazy demand for oil and gas on the international market  and if we're not providing cleaner product, everyone gets the dirty stuff from countries with horrible environmental and human rights policies.

1874 2018-07-17 19:57:19 Look at $TSLA.  Nothing matters but the cost of money.  Look at all the BOJ ECB easy money reassurances.  The efforts to surpress oil (inflation).  
You are literally fighting the government by even shorting speculative risk.
1875 2018-07-17 19:57:14 Fun fact for #TarotTuesday -- lemongrass oil is cleansing and uplifting. It also stimulates psychic awareness. It's safe to use around cats in low concentration, so long as they don't ingest it or get it on their skin. Always be aware of what you use around your furry friends.
1876 2018-07-17 19:56:56 7 months ago I got an oil check at this place for the first time. Came back again today before I even got out of the car they remembered my name and what we talked last time. Either:

1890 2018-07-17 19:54:56 They have their oil rich paymasters to please. Wealth comes first before patriotism. Look @ the future king, Charles, who cosies up to Saudi kingdom.Sorry to say, but the elite Establishment have sold UK heritage out. Once the Quuen is gone, it will be the end of UK as we know it
1891 2018-07-17 19:54:45 Could Trump and Putin merely be plotting to divide up loot? Arctic shipping routes, oil deals, coal, arms, development deals?  Trying to crash economies and privatize (US, Europe, Asia) and grab enormous shares for themselves?  Isn't this Putin's track record?
1892 2018-07-17 19:54:44 No deal on oil and natural gas with Russia
1893 2018-07-17 19:54:38 Getting my oil changed and the mechanic just keeps smiling & saying you my favorite  
Yeaa I know you smell that pressure
1894 2018-07-17 19:54:38 I was so close to scheduling an appointment to cut my hair BUT I don’t feel like fussing. So I just rubbed extra Wild growth oil on my sides to expedite this growing back process. Soon as I have grip NeNe can braid this mess.

1898 2018-07-17 19:54:06 My guess is that Cohen never spent a single minute in a uniform. Just another snake oil salesman, who narrowly escaped prison, became a politician, and wants somebody else to fight his unwarranted battles for him. Charge him with sedition and drag him out of Congress in cuffs.

1902 2018-07-17 19:53:45 IL n'y a pas de problème si la consommation est divisé par deux en 20 ans. Où est le problème? Le déclin de la production est une chose, la consommation est autre chose.
1903 2018-07-17 19:53:38 I’ve been so upset that pat was gone because buying weed and oil is so much more expensive thru other ppl he literally is best

1905 2018-07-17 19:53:14 I haven't heard of a gay conversion therapy that has been proven effective and many are correlated with an increase in the chance of suicide. Taking snake oil off the shelves is in the governments purview.

1918 2018-07-17 19:51:36 @GeorgeSelgin at #CatoAMU: The problem with using tight money to keep inflation down in the face of a negative supply shock, e.g. the rising price of oil in 2008, is not that it’s hard to get the magnitude right. It’s that it shouldn’t be done.
1919 2018-07-17 19:51:35 My coworker says bacon oil helps her reach her fat goal on keto
1920 2018-07-17 19:51:33 Hmm I don't see a certain "wolf that named himself as a thing to check the oil level of your Engine oil x3
1921 2018-07-17 19:51:30 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

1924 2018-07-17 19:50:49 I now spray the sides of my bed with tea tree oil every couple of days lol, so I guess the ant equivalent of making a circle with salt to protect from the supernatural
1925 2018-07-17 19:50:46 capitalism caused the war in Syria keeps it going to prop up share prices of arms/oil companies and then refuses to share generated wealth with refugees. Saying that communism is violent by nature shows a complete lack of understanding of what it is, authoritarianism is the issue
1926 2018-07-17 19:50:21 I would say Trump & Putin are way too close. It sounded like Putin had the right wing playbook down pat. I wonder what they talked about in private? Iran, N Korea, Syria, oil, world peace or how to get our stories straight & introduce some conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton.
1927 2018-07-17 19:50:16 Oh dear, get better soon hey. Drink a tablespoon of olive oil before you do these shenanigans next time  *I have never done it though, but they say it works *
1928 2018-07-17 19:50:09 I think Senator Paul makes some good points. President Trump is looking at the big picture. Russia is a major nuclear power and has a huge supply of oil. It may be a good strategy to have good relations with Russia when negotiating with China.
1929 2018-07-17 19:50:06 Chemical exfoliation is such a plug. What's your skin type? Oil cleansing is epic as well, hydrate skin always.
1930 2018-07-17 19:50:05 Now, to put things in #perspective; #Russia #economy is appr. equal to #Spain

Their economy is very weak
The inequality is jaw-dropping
They have nothing to offer but Oil and LNG 
#Syria and #Ukraine drain the coffers

Why #Trump wants to be 'friends' with #Putin?

For himself!
1931 2018-07-17 19:49:54 They had plans to steal a COUNTRY! COMMERCE, TREASURY, MILLITARY! COURTS! OIL! GAS! Then cleanse the Country of people of COLOR!
1932 2018-07-17 19:49:51 Yes, we can't leave Hitch out of the mix. I think there are stellar examples of great storytelling in every era. The Best Years of Our Lives in the 1940s tackled PTSD early on. Giant circa 1956 was a sweeping epic about the Texas oil boom spanning decades with a great cast.
1933 2018-07-17 19:49:51 Like Oil x We Will Worship
1934 2018-07-17 19:49:45 Seems like everyone on Twitter is talking about #aaog which tells it’s own story..... it’s going one way into this drill glad I’ve bought a few looking for 150% easy gains from here when first oil is reported from top two zones....maybe 200% plus if it really gets going

1940 2018-07-17 19:49:03 Important to mention that Trumps actions have all benefited Israel. Trump & netanyahu endorsed eachother AND both were funded by ADELSON in the tune of $100's of Millions. This investigation MUST include #IsraelGate & stop being a coverup of israels & corp banker oil crimes.

1946 2018-07-17 19:48:38 We buy oil from Russia too.

1950 2018-07-17 19:48:14 No evidence if Iran had nukes they would be stupid enough to use them first. The US has a long history of overthrowing governments with oil and they never attack countries who can defend themselves. Operation AJAX is declassified look it up.
1951 2018-07-17 19:48:09 Depends if they’ve changed the oil or not

1974 2018-07-17 19:45:20 Except Putin is mistaken. On balance, American economy still benefits from lower oil prices. Yes, it benefits a lot less than in the past, but it is still a major net benefit
1975 2018-07-17 19:45:13 65 million? Every other president got 8-12...and Enron had nothing to do with the bushes. Fell apart in 01. They had an oil tycoon prior to his presidency..hence why he was a member of the deep state and drove america into a war we didnt need to be in. Because war=money

2026 2018-07-17 19:39:42 Since I left Grenada, “Jab” means so much more to me than old oil, horns and Jouvert morning. I don’t know how to put it in words but damn I’m proud to represent such a wonderful island, people and culture. Jab is the lifestyle.
2027 2018-07-17 19:39:39 Nasdaq still hitting new highs. Commodities (ex oil) still getting hammered. When this reverses it could be sudden. Utilities, energy, reits may be the best plays.
2028 2018-07-17 19:39:35 Your characterization of the EU as one of our three biggest foes doesn't sound very positive. Further, calling Germany, and Angela Merkel lackeys of Russia due to an oil deal isn't a good way to inspire them to support you. Bad move, and feeds all the bad optics.
2029 2018-07-17 19:39:31 extra virgin oil just like grayson sksksk
2030 2018-07-17 19:38:57 Try NativeChild Hair growth castor oil. It helps. And makes hair softer.
2031 2018-07-17 19:38:53 Hello guys, below is a list of available oils                                                            Argan oil                     Tea Tree oil                                                 Jojoba oil.                   Carrot oil.             Lavender oil.

After the settlement at 2:30 pm EST, #US Oil trading becomes less volatile due to the drop of liquidity. It's better not to enter new trades during these low liquidity hours because the market is going to nowhere most of the time.
2033 2018-07-17 19:38:45 Where’s the fire oil at
2034 2018-07-17 19:38:34 who could have expected this ?....everyone...create a vaccum and what do you think happens...the same holds true for afghanastan....we still should have taken iraqs oil...call it spoils of war
2035 2018-07-17 19:38:29 Oil sniffer Kaitlyn said JC has a power
2036 2018-07-17 19:38:29 Don’t miss the point. There’s a lot of oil and gas up under the Arctic tundra. Global warming only makes it easier to get to. Global warming is a feature, not a bug.
2037 2018-07-17 19:38:25 COMPUTER: Wouldn't you prefer a workable agreement on nuclear nonproliferation, the free flow of oil at market prices, and a common effort to combat Islamic radicalism?

@POLITICO EDITORS: Later. Let's play Global Thermo-Nuclear War.
2038 2018-07-17 19:38:19 I wish I could try @ChickfilA but they use peanut oil so that will never happen 
2039 2018-07-17 19:38:11 u want some of the repellent i just bought. its made of like coconut oil and lavender so its unclear if it works or not but it sure smells good
2040 2018-07-17 19:37:56 and good quality olive oil beats both
2041 2018-07-17 19:37:55 #CORRECTION Recently I may have been overheard saying I would like to see @realDonaldTrump boiled in oil for his unforgivable treachery and betrayal of our country. What I *meant* to say was that I WOULDN'T like to see him boiled in oil. Sorry for the confusion. #WhatIMeantToSay
2042 2018-07-17 19:37:55 Day 5 of no tramadol
and The pain is almost unbearable....time to stock up on the CBD oil. 
Still puzzles me how I use cannabis but they dish out tramadol like sweets....just glad I wasn’t on a high dose 
2043 2018-07-17 19:37:53 I’m actually crying Ethan goes “extra virgin oil, just like Grayson.”
2044 2018-07-17 19:37:53 FINALLY! WELCOME TO OIL COUNTRY EVAN! YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE PLAYING WITH MCDAVID AND CO!

2046 2018-07-17 19:37:36 So I found out today that I’ve been driving for awhile without an oil cap. By the grace of god I didn’t blow anything.... 
2047 2018-07-17 19:37:26 I forgot to clean out my car before taking it in for an oil change and I know that they’re judging me for my cup holder full of straw wrappers and collection of empty water bottles… I’m so sorry that you had to see how I live Alex from the Car Dealership
2048 2018-07-17 19:37:23 I don’t understand why cars can’t let us know when our battery is about to die?! They tell us to fasten our seatbelts, check oil, get gas, and even alert us when our tire pressure is low. But there’s no warning when your battery is going to die.
2049 2018-07-17 19:37:18 "Extra virgin olive oil just like Grayson " I SCREAMED @EthanDolan @GraysonDolan
2050 2018-07-17 19:37:12 extra virgin olive oil. just like grayson
2051 2018-07-17 19:37:09 Cut myself shaving. Worse pain then getting my head kicked in, and accidentally being burned on the hand with cooking oil
2052 2018-07-17 19:36:45 The one thing that should be clear to anyone who has read history: it's all about money. In the case of Russia, either plundering their resources, stealing their oil & gas customers in Europe, or bringing them to heel to "our" bankers.

Idealism & ideology are excuse not causes.
2053 2018-07-17 19:36:40 And we’re supposed to buy that sake oil? No thanks I’ve had enough #Basta
2054 2018-07-17 19:36:40 “Extra virgin oil... just like Grayson” I FUCKING DIED OMFG
2055 2018-07-17 19:36:33 I never saw it, omer and I discussed this when my mom was freaking out on us and said how we are “out of touch with reality” because we said we didn’t want to go to get halwa puri with her. his idea was to spike smtg w/ cbd oil or make her special brownies so she can chill out
2056 2018-07-17 19:36:31 Pasta. Chilli flakes. Any green veg that needs eating. Artichoke hearts in a jar if I've got them. Grated cheese. Oil. Yum.
2057 2018-07-17 19:36:26 IIRC the sanctions are less significant than the oil price, but are still important because:

1) they're an additional burden, felt more because of the oil price
2) they targeted Putin's inner circle, so you wouldn't expect wider economic effects from that part
2058 2018-07-17 19:36:21 Yeah I should someone ran it and forgot to add oil to the oil side of the gas injection. Big project
2059 2018-07-17 19:36:14 Extra virgin oil,just like Grayson.I DIED HAHAHAHAHAH
2060 2018-07-17 19:36:05 How New Orleans put a “R” in words like oil is puzzling but it’s sexy to hear women say it
2061 2018-07-17 19:35:58 I forgot need to go get my oil changed
2062 2018-07-17 19:35:53 . If you give me money I vote for you. All of them are the same. The money is our oil money.
2063 2018-07-17 19:35:33 everyone is saying air-fryers are the way, I think I'm going for it.  I need to feed my fried fish craving without all that damn oil lol
2064 2018-07-17 19:35:32 “extra virgin oil... just like grayson” IM DEAD
2065 2018-07-17 19:35:31 Is changing oil a lost art???
2066 2018-07-17 19:35:29 The private sector is all over it. Investment in clean energy is higher than in oil and gas
2067 2018-07-17 19:35:27 Fun Fact: after years of literally nothing working, I accidentally made my stretch marks disappear by exfoliating them with a mixture of brown sugar and olive oil 4 times a week.
2068 2018-07-17 19:35:25 So, are we retraining coal miners? Oil rig operators? We know the GOP doesn't think renewable energy is where it's at........
2069 2018-07-17 19:35:23 Anyone able to perceive the world can tell how performative and superficial their patriotism has always been. The national "defence" is always about money. Same with the war hawks. They only attack smaller countries who have oil.
2070 2018-07-17 19:35:20 He said cents not dollars but yes the idea that the oil companies will lower the cost of gas to “help” us is asinine. Conservatives cut from education and healthcare and somehow people forgot that... it’s sad. NDP had their shot n couldn’t capture it. PC reign for 8 years min
2071 2018-07-17 19:35:14 trump is PT Barnum surrounded by self interest clowns knowing that there are enough 'suckers' who will buy his BS snake oil
2072 2018-07-17 19:35:09 Nascar at IRP / Lucas Oil Raceway was the best race of the year Xfinity and Truck. Fans want this kind of show!
2073 2018-07-17 19:35:09 He criticized Europe for giving him billions of dollars for oil, this was just days ago, get a life
2074 2018-07-17 19:35:06 Snake oil salesman. He thinks his supporters are so stupid
2075 2018-07-17 19:35:06 Which news outlets are reputable? Because the ones that are bought by big oil, big pharma, and the Military Industiral Complex (how about them boeing ads so that we all want to buy a jet guys) aren't reputable. Washington Post is bought and paid for by the CIA through Bezos. But
2076 2018-07-17 19:35:02 Well, they have to prepare for a no deal, don't they? The UK government is not making any steps towards a deal. Ireland is moving its oil out of the UK; Firms are moving out or not investing. @BBCNews might not be reporting but these things ARE happening.
2077 2018-07-17 19:34:58 Modern facilities for fan comfort. Even Lucas oil raceway lacks what a lot of fans want. There was a ton of structure around the track either. This is coming from a female who enjoys the sport.
2078 2018-07-17 19:34:57 I burned my neck with some hot ass oil and that is how my week is going 
2079 2018-07-17 19:34:50 bull @ subway really put just oil on my sub... when i clearly said oil & vinegar... but who ever would even get just oil in the first place... now i have an oily sub. yucky :(
2080 2018-07-17 19:34:27 I'm still waiting for the Cheney/Oil Industry transcripts.
2081 2018-07-17 19:34:18 I've been growing out for a bit and once I hit a certain point it stopped being annoying. Beard oil has been very helpful with not making it the itchy and scratchy show
2082 2018-07-17 19:34:09 sunflower seed oil
2083 2018-07-17 19:33:58 Our Canadian innovation in environmental technology is going to have far more of an impact than Canada tightening our belt. Our exports are more responsibly sourced than so many other oil producing countries. It makes sense for us to use the profit to innovate.
2084 2018-07-17 19:33:58 Kamu pakai cleansing oil apa btw? Minyak zaitun? *maap banyak nanya.
2085 2018-07-17 19:33:56 extra virgin olive oil, just like grayson
2086 2018-07-17 19:33:53 Please let me know what highlighter/body oil/setting spray has you glowing like this?! I'm obsessed!
2087 2018-07-17 19:33:52 @realDonaldTrump Trump is considering using our Strategic Oil Reserves to lower oil prices before the elections. Trump willing to Jepordizes USA security for his poltical ambitions. Wakeup my fellow Republicans, Trump cares about Trump, not the USA.
2088 2018-07-17 19:33:42 Why would anyone here have heard of Armie Hammer's famous great-grandfather, Jewish oil mogul Armand Hammer? Better to make up random shit instead. Is our children learning?
2089 2018-07-17 19:33:39 "Extra virgin Olive Oil, just like Grayson" omg I screamed 
2090 2018-07-17 19:33:39 I have heard that. And who now controls that “private land”? The land owners or Communist government? Who was put in charge of their oil sector, private citizens or the government? The latter. Who controls the resources in Venezuela? The government. Save it.

2092 2018-07-17 19:33:38 No Amy, China will soon get oil & later, LNG from Canada.
Canada has to start a program to export to a wider customer base, wherever that market needs our resources & products.
2093 2018-07-17 19:33:37 Was about to say lmao fish products go in their own car we can only use fish with, although imma be honest nuggets boil hard and sometimes the oil will spill into the filet vat.
2094 2018-07-17 19:33:28 Pasta with olive oil tastes bomb.
2095 2018-07-17 19:33:27 I don't think Trump appreciates how totally humiliated by "cooperation" in Syria he's been. Great for Putin whether it's his place as regional power, the oil fields or domestic image or showing West's impotence against Assad's brutality incl. chemical weapons.
2096 2018-07-17 19:33:26 its fried in the same type of oil, but its seperate from other fried items.
2097 2018-07-17 19:33:20 Hi Nicole, oh no! You can apply some baby oil to the skin and wash away the pigments with soap and water.
2098 2018-07-17 19:33:17 That Dawn commercial with the duck in the oil spill makes me 
2099 2018-07-17 19:33:16 Can't stop thinking about how my parents are stoked about some CBD oil they copped at a truck stop in vermont

2103 2018-07-17 19:33:05 I once saw a lady bring her Allion for oil change yet the shock was protruding coz the mountin had was kaput.
2104 2018-07-17 19:32:51 Eating healthy stuff sucks ass so much, so heres a Tip: cover that shit in butter and salt and cheese and oil and Italian Spices and fried meat and chheese. THERE; Now it doesnt suck!!
2105 2018-07-17 19:32:50 Like the way YOU lied during "Osama Bin Laden's fake capture/death" or about "Gaddafi's (non-existent) murderous regime" in order to overthrow gadaffi/stop his gold backed currency ambitions, seize control of Libyan #oil fields and steal all of #Libya 's 143 tons of gold?!

2109 2018-07-17 19:32:32 Really makes a friendo oil up the guillotine, eh
2110 2018-07-17 19:32:29 You said "put together". That's different than "be a guest". That's like saying, "Hey @KaseyLansdale can you help me change the oil on my motorcycle" versus "Hey, Kasey, want to go for a ride on my motorcycle?" (Although in truth, I wouldnt be able to change the oil on my own).
2111 2018-07-17 19:32:28 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
2112 2018-07-17 19:32:27 I saw a Moscow media outlet had claimed that Putin "outmaneuvered" Trump. Not to put too fine a point on it, but from what I've seen one could outmaneuver Trump in a crippled oil tanker.

I said you have more than one.

She thought I said oil

2119 2018-07-17 19:31:54 Reforming Westminster at this point is like trying to turn an oil tanker around while slaloming between the icebergs. I'm not saying it can't be done, but it would be far easier to jump in the lifeboat and make for dry land (yes the geography in this analogy is a bit  sketchy)
2120 2018-07-17 19:31:54 And I wore the wrong shorts to get an oil change.

2124 2018-07-17 19:31:10 Expensive natural beauty products are nice, but “raw” stuff is so slept on! Straight up honey, rosehip seed oil, mint oil, castor oil, apple cider vinegar, etc. can work wonders for hair, skin, and nails and are cheaper.
2125 2018-07-17 19:31:10 Trump has:

1. Provided anti-tank missles to the Ukranian opposition, something Obama never did
2. Bombed Assad twice
3. Pulled out of Iran deal that Russia supported
4. Asked Germany to stop using Russian heating oil and use American instead

But Putin controls him. 
2126 2018-07-17 19:31:05 Reeves also produces colored pencils and pastels (oil and chalk).
I'll stick with my Prismacolor and Derwent Studio/Coloursoft colored pencils, myself.
2127 2018-07-17 19:31:03 What is the benefit of stopping a pipeline?  The oil is still transported by rail which is FAR riskier. Our Canadian product is sourced much more responsibly than the nations we buy from on the East coast.  We need better infrastructure, which is ultimately more environmental.
2128 2018-07-17 19:31:02 As an Energy Economist, my greatest fear for #Iraq is to become the next Venezuela. 2009-2014, country's oil revenues were almost $1tr ($1000bn). Instead of being used to stimulate the war torn economy, a Caracas style approach was followed by Maliki. #Basra #BasraProtests (1)

2132 2018-07-17 19:30:52 Maybe the democracy never existed in the first place. I know for certain that, in the case of Iran, a democratically-elected socialist was ousted by the West's intelligence agencies to replace him with someone who was sympathetic to Big Oil. He was a secular nationalist who (1)
2133 2018-07-17 19:30:48 You fell right for the snake oil pitch, alot did. But it's not to late for you and your peers to look in the mirror and fix this.
2134 2018-07-17 19:30:45 No problem. But oil production on the skin is very often “misdiagnosed”. But if your skin is oily/combination, gel-based moisturizers are best. They absorb into the skin quickly, giving hydration with not an oily, but youthful glow.
2135 2018-07-17 19:30:38 Do you not see outside interference because of the global importance of oil as the heart?

2140 2018-07-17 19:30:27 The issue here is that the sector has fallen into a "value trap" and most institutional investors are beta followers on selected names, particularly the oil majors XOM, CVX, RDS, COP, BP. The rest down to the small ones, are abandoned...
2141 2018-07-17 19:30:20 False economy held up by a trillion dollar addition to the National debt with the rich and corporations who moved out during recession  , were the largest benefactors. The middle class and the poor have already lost the benefit as a result and no raises and and increase for oil .

2145 2018-07-17 19:29:56 Your head get oil, this is exactly what happened. People are equating the slap to the eggs forgetting that food is food. They both have issues but people don crucify the guy for slapping (unwarranted) the girl.

2147 2018-07-17 19:29:41 We deffo can. Especially when we get to keep the oil revenues. Not sure what England will do in all honesty tho.  No oil. No car industry. No manufacturing of note. No city. No future.
2148 2018-07-17 19:29:37 OH MY FUCKING GOD ETHAN REALLY SAID SOME “extra virgin olive oil. just like grayson” IM LAUGHING MY ASS OFF

2152 2018-07-17 19:29:22 Yes but that has to be factored into LCA.

Grass takes in X of carbon in to grow. Stored carbon in its biomass is released in form of co2 & methane (C in CH4). 

Currently its like measuring emissions from car running biofuel as if that fuel was oil based by ignoring biomass seq

2154 2018-07-17 19:29:17 Lots of GOP are racist Nazis. Look at Steve King, PenceTrump. All racist Nazis. Now ask why taxpayers are paying to clean up the Pence family oil co pollution (20 mill so far) while the pence's keep their millions. They polluted, filed bankruptcy and taxpayers are paying for it.

2158 2018-07-17 19:28:43 Snake oil salesmen also don't have to deal with the steam refund system. The massive amount of game returns + poison of the studio brand is what prompted them to fix it, remember they went radio silent until valve started offering refunds past the 2 hour mark like they usually do
2159 2018-07-17 19:28:38 Just constantly moisturize your belly& your hips! Mine are steady moisturized haha Vitamin E oil, there’s some type of oil at GNC For pregnant mothers also.
2160 2018-07-17 19:28:32 Do like Ellen said and put the dry shampoo in the night before. It allows it to actually sit and work through your hair to remove the oil. Also if you every run out of dry shampoo, baby powder also does the trick. I use Moroccan oil shampoos for my hair when it gets greasy!
2161 2018-07-17 19:28:25 According to google, the “molecules that make up oil are larger than those that make up water, so they cannot pack as tightly together as water molecules can”. In the same volume of water and oil, there are more water molecules because they packed closer together.
2162 2018-07-17 19:28:24 Canada's oil and gas sector is in no way "the same old".  Canada's innovations make us a world leader in environmental policy for resource extraction.  We need to get our own resources across our country so we're not buying poor product at premium costs from other nations.
2163 2018-07-17 19:28:09 That is is the point of a carbon price. Get those that use more to pay more. Almost all major technological advancements have had government support...from space exploration to oil sands. The singular innovative company set apart from government is a fallacy.
2164 2018-07-17 19:28:08 You seem very obsessive about Liverpool? So we’ve started to spend a bit of money. Not before time is it? Have a look at how much city have spent since the oil money came in. You can’t criticise any club in world football for overspending. Or are you just a little worried?

2166 2018-07-17 19:27:58 My bf who works at a medical dispensary has said that CBD oil works directly & better with THC (even a tiny amount). If you don't mind the psychoactive effects, I find that CBD 4:1 products are great; a large amount of CBD & enough THC to activate healing properties. 
2167 2018-07-17 19:27:58 ‘EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, JUST LIKE GRAYSON’ aphahahah dead asffff
2168 2018-07-17 19:27:46 House carpet cleaned now oil changed and tires rotated... this is my day today... thus far anyway.

2171 2018-07-17 19:27:33 When I ate meat Italian subs were my JAM. Put all the ham salami and prosciutto on there sis. ALL OF IT. With mad oil and vinegar salt and pepper provolone cheese lettuce tomato banana peppers . WOW IM HUNGRY NOW
2172 2018-07-17 19:27:17 Bit of salt, pepper and a dash of olive oil 
2173 2018-07-17 19:27:16 4b. Because our economy is oil depended, we might need to pray that we won’t witness crude oil price deflation again because everything depends on what we make. We already have so much debt and the borrowing hanging on the budget is already bad.

2178 2018-07-17 19:26:17 It’s not the 70s and 80s now though, is it? The money in football is insane, the stakes are huge, and clubs like Liverpool or Tottenham that progress while insisting on sustainable spending warrant appreciation. Net spend is important, in my view, especially if ur not an oil club
2179 2018-07-17 19:26:07 Oil prices down more than 5 percent in fifteen minutes? Natural move or Whale tactic? #oilprice
2180 2018-07-17 19:26:01 More snake oil anyone?

2187 2018-07-17 19:25:01 I don't think there was snake oil involved at all. Overconfidence in feature delivery dates, but certainly not snake oil.

Snake oil salesmen pack up and get out of town, they don't work hard for 2 years to make it up to people.
2188 2018-07-17 19:24:41 LOL IM NEVER GOING TO GET MY OIL CHANGED EVER AGAIN
2189 2018-07-17 19:24:39 You said the same thing about oil set up being bad for the bears last week.

2192 2018-07-17 19:24:32 if a country is using it's power to keep another country under it's control via debt in order to exploit them for cheap oil, then I'm going to calm it imperialism, because that's what it is.
2193 2018-07-17 19:24:17 It’s been a busy Tuesday. I’m already looking to the weekend. Going out to the mountains  so that will be fun. Just need to make sure i bring my @NaturesUltra  lime CBD oil and find a good morning routine to keep me on track. #healthy #exercise #cbdlife #naturesultra #beerme
2194 2018-07-17 19:24:16 I think you mean, "building a pipeline so Canada can safely get our oil to an international market and use the money to continue being one of earths leaders in environmental innovation" will help.

2198 2018-07-17 19:23:41 I paid for my oil change and I felt grown then I texted my dad to pay me back because I’m sad that I wasted it 
2199 2018-07-17 19:23:38 My blot sheets end up becoming clear so I think it’s oil. 
2200 2018-07-17 19:23:33 And ingredients for pasta! you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
2201 2018-07-17 19:23:33 He didn't defer. When they spoke of oil, he said that Russia would be competition, but that the USA planned to compete and WIN. The rest, he made clear. he is going for peace. Why be an asshole? He knows as well as Putin that war between the two equals death for us all. Sit down!
2202 2018-07-17 19:23:30 Getting my oil changed at the VW dealership makes me want a new car every time.
2203 2018-07-17 19:23:27 Stopped at valvoline to get an oil change and the man who checked me in put my new license plates on my car for me  shout out @Valvoline in green. Y’all the real MVPs

2209 2018-07-17 19:22:48 I get you, and I am not cool with other publishers doing it either, the Watch Dogs demo was asinine. But the mismanaged expectations here were entirely the studios own fault and I don't think the snake oil selling was as well-intentioned and accidental as you're making it out
2210 2018-07-17 19:22:37 Lol Oil dey your head well well
2211 2018-07-17 19:22:16 I had a 91 Eagle Summit after high school. It was self sufficient in oil changes. Oil light came on, change the oil and filter, oil would burn off, oil light comes on, change oil and filter and repeat.
2212 2018-07-17 19:22:11 I’m from Texas I know it Will not bring prices down. OPEC controls prices and our Oil companies will go right along with them. They are the biggest crooks on the planet, besides Trump
2213 2018-07-17 19:21:59 He might care if it's actually water or motor oil.
The fact that a user doesn't care how their wonderful app is built completely is a different thing from saying all the skills used to build it are irrelevant and the people fully fungible.

2216 2018-07-17 19:21:05 ....Ernie Coombs died in 2001. Oh! I see what you did there. Funny. Funny. Joke. Also, claiming cowboy hats represent oil/workers is about as absurd as it gets.
2217 2018-07-17 19:20:45 Most of it comes from #Fracking..which in effect hollows out the bedrock below ground...this is going to be a problem. Ironic that Americans call Canadian #bitumen (oil sands) "dirty" but are gung-ho on this process so geologically disruptive it's banned in many places in Canada.

2233 2018-07-17 19:18:50 However if you watch the interview again you will notice that Putin flinched over the Oil/Gas issue. It was a sore topic.

2237 2018-07-17 19:18:21 His fingers unguardedly traced along the vial of sugar-plum-scented oil.
2238 2018-07-17 19:18:19 Or, just use mayo. What the heck is your problem with mayonnaise? Olive oil and lemon juice are ingredients in mayo. Do you hate eggs or something?
2239 2018-07-17 19:18:14 “our love affair with data: data is the new big oil in the 21st. it’s in infinite supply. in one minute: 3.5 million searches on Google. all this data can be leveraged. 12% of data collected is actually analyzed. we don’t have data problems we have insight problems.”

2241 2018-07-17 19:17:59 “For all intents and purposes” it is unlimited (as in, within our lifetimes any level of demand can be met). Once again, oil prices can only go up so far before the market reacts and opens up more supply.  That supply serves to balance prices.
2242 2018-07-17 19:17:54 Except the expansion isn't shipping oil or gas, it's shipping bitumen which when it spills on our coastline will be impossible to clean up. And the pic? Way to use the race card to try to stir the pot though. What an asshole. #bcpoli

2251 2018-07-17 19:16:33 Because they never had the "biggest oil reserves in the world". They never relied in the mining industry, only in their talented people.
2252 2018-07-17 19:16:29 And throw gas on an oil fire? Of course
2253 2018-07-17 19:16:26 Add the fact that Iranian oil is no longer on the market for the most part, Venuzuela's output is drastically down and the supply side is not meeting the demand side.  Texas may be drilling more than them, but they cannot process it fast enough to meet the new US drilling output
2254 2018-07-17 19:16:24 Bless ya. I was 4yrs old in 76 So can't really remember much.
I've loved the clear skies & sunshine, mainly because I've done what I can in morning & thought sod it & rested in garden in afternoon. Nearly on my 4th bottle of spf 15 oil but ...

2261 2018-07-17 19:15:43 -the white chicken is 37 calories (actually I ate two slices so 74)

-the tortilla wrap is ~200cal

-the olive oil 40cal (so a lil spoon)

-the egg 80cal + a bit of butter to cook it 

-for the salsa sauce I don’t really know ~50cal

2267 2018-07-17 19:14:52 Because even with the US increasing its supplies.  There has been a bottleneck in the pipelines.  They don't have enough pipeline capacity to get it all to refineries.  They are drilling more oil yes, but much of that extra is being stored because they cannot get it to refineries

2273 2018-07-17 19:14:16 I had listen this many times during my tenure in Ladakh, a 1971 war veteran(Ladakh Scouts) told me that when they captured a Paki post somewhere near Turtuk village, they found only a cane of carocine oil & merely 5 kg of rice. I had 2 of his room on rent in Domkhar village.

2281 2018-07-17 19:13:50 He reopened the annexes immediately, he delayed enforcing sanctions as long as politically possible, eased sanctions on Russian oil and talks about easing more. He threw Bill Browder under the bus for Putin's lies.

He's insulted everyone in the world EXCEPT Putin or Russia.

2288 2018-07-17 19:12:27 Side note: cannabis oil has it's place; there are some amazing trials showing exciting results for Parkinson's and Epilepsy to name but a few and if nothing else, we always have hope of finding a cure for Cancer in nature.

We will never stop looking, that goes without saying.
2289 2018-07-17 19:12:13 It’s not like they are actively opening up oil exploration off the west coast
2290 2018-07-17 19:12:08 Am I the only one worrying about depreciating rupee, increasing oil prices and the inflationary bomb it could land? 
2291 2018-07-17 19:12:05 So glad that the dewy look is in because my face is basically an oil rig during the summer
2292 2018-07-17 19:12:04 Posted "Oil and M0ney" Live from Moscow and I think you'll like it. Take a peek

2293 2018-07-17 19:12:02 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2294 2018-07-17 19:11:45 @Wizkidayo does your hands smell like hot oil
2295 2018-07-17 19:11:38 You don't at least have olive oil???
2296 2018-07-17 19:11:30 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2297 2018-07-17 19:11:28 It should not take 2 hours to get a oil change

2299 2018-07-17 19:11:07 I had a lot of physical pain going on today and it was frustrating me, so I slathered myself in CBD/THC oil, and it just occurred to me that I'm a little high. This is enhancing my work day considerably.
2300 2018-07-17 19:11:07 @cnn so there are a lot of Snake Oil saleman in the WH!
2301 2018-07-17 19:10:57 Garlic, in large doses, is toxic to dogs. But with garlic bread, I’d be more bothered about giving the wee fella a bad belly from the richness of butter and oil!
2302 2018-07-17 19:10:54 Joni, you must realize that economic activity of the scale of oil and gas will inevitably benefit more than just the province in which it is produced? Raising all ships is the goal, but progressives have a need to limit opportunity for us all....mean spirited and unhelpful.
2303 2018-07-17 19:10:37 It will bring oil prices down !
2304 2018-07-17 19:10:36 Actually I'm taking the word of the IG doc's and NSA released doc's, informing Potus of who the bad players are.  Still, you've got more jobs then ever, manufacturing ramping up to all time highs, housing market starting to bomb again, oil & gas trade, etc etc.  All time highs
2305 2018-07-17 19:10:35 After Putin meeting--there is no trust of POTUS to do anything right. NO to any Court appointments and NO to non-Progressive FDIC & SEC. NO to opening Public Lands to BIG GAS & OIL. PLEASE!
2306 2018-07-17 19:10:26 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
2307 2018-07-17 19:10:15 But yet the USA still imports oil and prices keep rising.

2313 2018-07-17 19:09:07 its ok for Obama to have more flexibility w/vlad after the election, stand down when Russia hacked the system under his watch, Clintons enriched themselves then hit a reset button, Members of the EU who we protect from Russia depend on them for oil/gas? But Trumps the puppet?
2314 2018-07-17 19:09:06 Let’s see how good this coconut oil really is 
2315 2018-07-17 19:09:02 pede mag apply ng taga lotio, taga oil at taga patigas
2316 2018-07-17 19:08:56 He signed a $65 million book deal and gets paid on average half a milly for a speech. Forbes did a huge article. Every president benefits post presidency. The bush administration created Enron dude.... biggest oil company until they were found as fraud
2317 2018-07-17 19:08:55 It's a tough environment in the oil and gas industry, but Holland's stainless steel #nameplates are manufactured to last.
2318 2018-07-17 19:08:31 I am disappointed at the service provided @MercedesBenzUK #MercedesBenz @mercedesbenz_ir. I own a C200 and I have a faulty oil cooler, both Mercedes and their dealer seem to understand the cause and not interested to find out why it failed. Com’on it’s an integral part of the car
2319 2018-07-17 19:08:30 Genie energy. Look it up. That guy has someone else's heart beating in him and he and Lord Rothschild have a master plan for their sandbox that they play in with blood and oil.
2320 2018-07-17 19:08:30 I would be surprised if creating a G2 union called "the United Powers of the North Emisphere" UPNE wasn't thought of, and why not with a joint annexation of Canada. EstCan & WestCan. Canada is stuck between Trump & Putin, has Oil, Water, Land, Resources.
Nothing is off the table.
2321 2018-07-17 19:08:01 Absolutely right sir, successive government never  saw the need for that after all they get oil money Abuja.
2322 2018-07-17 19:08:00 OMG, u really are not well. U want to protect a live-fire-test-range? All s/be opposed to offshore drilling regardless. Existing fields r established but a blight. Proof of disaster is the BP disaster that we still see the effects of. Oil is not everything. Promote renewable 1st.
2323 2018-07-17 19:07:46 @jschultzf3 I should have used the follow button. Fail on me. Details that ruin the story. More on roaches please! Used cooking oil in an empty tuna can, unless it is so big that it can reach the oil from the edge. I understand if you do not fry any foods.
2324 2018-07-17 19:07:37 Yes water and oil are fiiine  ah. Koloi ke stress.
2325 2018-07-17 19:07:30 I recommend everyone to use a body oil if you want super soft skin 
2326 2018-07-17 19:07:25 Not seeing how as u defend the greedy rather than progress. Remaining dependant on the finite resources, oil & coal are not eternal. As u find everything wrong with progress u find comfort in the only thing u know rather than find better alternatives I find that stupid
2327 2018-07-17 19:07:23 @marthamaccallum Germany makes a LNG/OIL Treaty w/ Russia w/o any communication with US, the previous administration didn't seem to care, now this POTUS speaks
on the subject he's torn apart where were they before, Hipocracy personified
2328 2018-07-17 19:07:23 So true. We need now more than ever before, strong leadership into the future emerging energy economies. To strategically dovetail oil & gas with renewable alternatives. The “same old....” strategy just won’t cut it. Change resisters, “step aside”!
2329 2018-07-17 19:07:13 Get you a man that takes out your trash and checks your oil sis

2333 2018-07-17 19:06:50 @realDonaldTrump Oops I was wrong he didn't say sorry. So at least he won't have to backtrack. He is still selling snake oil. I guess he thinks the US citizens and the world are really stupid. How many believe him? He's still blaming everyone else. Oh well nothing new today.
2334 2018-07-17 19:06:34 @Sawbones can you do an episode of omega-3? I hear it come up in mental health services a lot and as far as I can tell it's just another snake oil. I'd love to have more information to pushback against professionals with.
2335 2018-07-17 19:06:32 Uh. Remove clip, clear chamber? 
2336 2018-07-17 19:06:32 Follow the dark money, who it's coming from, who it's flowing through, who's getting it and why. Russia wanted sanctions lifted so they could get an oil deal through. They paid the Trump campaign thru the NRA to try to buy what they wanted. Why else was Tillerson 1st Sec of State
2337 2018-07-17 19:06:18 Sooo annoyed I keep leaving my oil my scalp itches 
2338 2018-07-17 19:06:15 @TopOil Hi, why is home heating oil 20 euro dearer per 500l in Mayo than Tipperary and its even dearer than in Dublin? Seems strange. Are people in rural Ireland penalised for living in the country?

2342 2018-07-17 19:05:30 Yea ur absolutely right . I was afraid twitter would blow me up between my pictures and disbelief at the volume of idiots that voted for this snake oil salesmen. My words include some very ugly 4 letter words But dumb racist fucks can sum it up. Thanks for the like Unbelievable!
2343 2018-07-17 19:05:10 hi, the palm oil industry can choke, have a nice day!
2344 2018-07-17 19:04:54 Long et excellent et thread !
Attention la notation "oïl" est sujette à caution
Exact pour le breton "ya" et en gallo, la langue britto-romane c'est "yan" pour la partie ouest et "ver" (racine latine)
2345 2018-07-17 19:04:44 Iran deal worst ever made. His greatness pulled us out of the worst deal ever made. Putin will help us on N Korea except when they give them illegal oil. They discussed nuclear arms reduction but there will be no nuclear arms reduction.
2346 2018-07-17 19:04:35 We could kill Russia without one single shot by selling our oil to Europe and bankrupting them.  They make zero and do nothing.
2347 2018-07-17 19:04:33 There are several things about adulthood that nobody ever prepared me for but the price of olive oil is high on that list.
2348 2018-07-17 19:04:25 Probably don't check to see if a round is chambered.

2352 2018-07-17 19:04:13 Thanks for this! I was wondering about that glow body oil! :)
2353 2018-07-17 19:04:07 Snake oil salesman 
2354 2018-07-17 19:04:01 Natgas prices are not often discussed but they are in the dumps, only here in AB,like oil & greatly exacerbate the pain which Albertans experience.  Notley initially was complacent & apparently decided  the AB energy industry be placed into harvest mode to appease aid & abet JT.
2355 2018-07-17 19:03:38 Managers with less XP are on 300 n below for Oil n Gas it's more on XP, Specialization or Favouritism, in Bank it's purely Favoritism no body cares about Merit there so if u earn 750k here nna hold that Place tight because elsewhere they don't pay as much or never regularly
2356 2018-07-17 19:03:33 absolutely loving the smoked oil over this gorgeous summer!
2357 2018-07-17 19:03:23 Of course he agrees to denuke DPRK. How else would Putin get that oil line down. 

Who does he think he's kidding?
2358 2018-07-17 19:03:11 I don't blame you, Oil Ocean is the worst ><
2359 2018-07-17 19:02:59 his beard start to connect just after he shaved, no need massage with oil then lol
2360 2018-07-17 19:02:56 I like Gamma Ray as well but Neck Oil has slightly less alcohol content and a really nice citrus flavour. Cans are a bit pricy so will stick to Shin Digger until you get time of the other two on tap.
2361 2018-07-17 19:02:51 Lying, its over north sea oil
2362 2018-07-17 19:02:51 In the face of election meddling hysteria, Democrats have been successful using the courts to block attempts to insure integrity of the actual vote.

2366 2018-07-17 19:02:07 His audiences are like Cult Followers. It doesn't matter that he's guilty of everything he now criticizes. Obama is a snake oil salesman.
2367 2018-07-17 19:02:04 .@realDonaldTrump BEHAVES, TALKS, ACTS LIME A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN, A USED CAR SALESMAN - ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUSTWORTHY.
2368 2018-07-17 19:01:48 Ba damuwa, zamu ga abunda za ayi a kai.
2369 2018-07-17 19:01:47 The Davines oil would be good for that then - it's quite expensive but you only use a really tiny bit per day.
2370 2018-07-17 19:01:32 *sigh* You are forgetting that for all intents and purposes, supply is unlimited. If prices climb, more costly oil (to produce) gets tapped so producers can make more money. In the end, demand is what drives it all...
2371 2018-07-17 19:01:29 Ahab stay there
2372 2018-07-17 19:01:15 they are white and faded i’ve only just noticed them gonna bio oil it
2373 2018-07-17 19:01:08 He was released again after the crime, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2374 2018-07-17 19:01:06 Nous ne critiquerons jamais ceux qui n’on pas encore sauté le pas ce qui est énervant c’est de voir des gens dire la France m’a tout donné etc etc et denigrer les pays musulmans mais il recherche quoi le din ? Impossible

2376 2018-07-17 19:00:59 the most hilarious part is the same people talked about how war was eminent yet these exact people are SO sad that war is not eminent. They so badly want to profit off of a war with Russia or North Korea, to drive ratings, profit from war industry, take over more oil, etc.
2377 2018-07-17 19:00:57 It was called Blood and Oil. They filmed on 25th street and I think I was only in the pilot episode. The work sucked.

2381 2018-07-17 19:00:42 Do the research, the science is not all that hard to unpack: Batteries are a environmental & socio-political nightmare. The bottom line: There is no quick technical fix. We must urgently start to plan for radically less mobility & de-growth. And yes, i'm anti oil.

2399 2018-07-17 18:58:51 If you live in or around Arvin, make sure to come out to tonight’s City Council meeting at 6. They’ll be voting to update the oil and gas ordinance, first time since 1960. The oil industry has been coming out in huge force to oppose updating them to be more health protective.
2400 2018-07-17 18:58:31 honestly nobody got me hip that parents not teaching how to change tires or check oil anymore. 

my parents just old school, huh?
2401 2018-07-17 18:58:30 The US intelligent is not used to  cut down criminals but to investigate where there oil for them to loot

2407 2018-07-17 18:58:03 Went in for a $30 oil change and tire rotation, $356 later I have 2 new brakes 
2408 2018-07-17 18:57:49 @realDonaldTrump We are with you, but if you do wrong, we will surely stand against you. Iran's oil can reach zero by November, so it should reach zero
2409 2018-07-17 18:57:39 I have very low standards so...
2410 2018-07-17 18:57:33 Since oil prices more than halved from $145 to $68, energy sectors has been dethroned by tech as the largest weight in SPX

2420 2018-07-17 18:56:51 No it's not significant because we don't get 40% of our oil from Russia and we use over 70 billion barrels a year. You can try to play with the numbers all you want. There is no hypocrisy because the numbers aren't even comparable. .00008 vs 40% isn't even worth a convo.
2421 2018-07-17 18:56:51 Norway has 74 state-owned companies, including the largest bank and oil company, and they’re doing great.

• OPEC is the only force by which producing countries impose economic interests
• OPEC should support move of ​​oil consuming organisation  to attenuate the geopolitical factor

2428 2018-07-17 18:56:18 I’ve seen this narrative growing the last couple of years. It feels like a submarine pushed by the oil industry to taint their most direct competitors. (This site seems pro oil/coal)
I’d love for journalists to track the financing.
(Not saying lithium batteries are sustainable)
2429 2018-07-17 18:56:18 I think you will need to distinguish between words and actions especially with Trump.  I see more sanctions, arming Ukraine, calling out Germany and their dependence on Russian oil, standing firm with Poland, urging increases defence funding of NATO, hard line on Syria and Iran.
2430 2018-07-17 18:56:12 Trump has lifted the 40-year  ban on exporting oil which will flood Europe and hurt Russia. The U.S.  oil output is expected to hit 10.7 million bpd this year, rivaling that  of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. European countries are now less likely to rely on Russia.
2431 2018-07-17 18:56:10 Oh and a small drop of olive oil in the camomile teas. It's all good for babies bottom.

2438 2018-07-17 18:55:41 Precisely why we should have stopped pussying about and given the EU ultimatums about free trade and be prepared for WTO. We should have passed aggressive business friendly tax laws to compete head on. We would succeed. The EU is an “oil tanker” with a 30 mile turning circle!!

2453 2018-07-17 18:53:35 I much prefer a train derailment right into the Fraser or Colorado rivers. Pipes are still the lowest risk to move oil or any other oil product from Alberta. Oil is not going away anytime before this new pipe will be obsolete. The risk analysis still says the pipe is safest
2454 2018-07-17 18:53:33 Nu uh! My crew would convert it to run on cow feces or cooking oil or something else so we could look for fuel deposits in space. Plus, it’s science fiction so I don’t have to play according to earth’s fuel rules.

2459 2018-07-17 18:53:18 It may affect price slightly, but a drop in price does not cause a spike in demand. That’s not how the economics of oil works.  Think about it. Are you going to consume (materially) more fuel in your car because it’s 8 cents less per litre?
2460 2018-07-17 18:53:15 Should post one at i75 and SR29 as well. I come from oil well and often take 41 instead of i75

2471 2018-07-17 18:51:58 So I’m going to write a blog on oil and gas, and PR people. I have to.
2472 2018-07-17 18:51:56 (3) GOP just elected a president who explicitly campaigned literally just stealing the oil from Iraq, again making moral equivalence on even this limited topic indefensible.
2473 2018-07-17 18:51:38 I agree that that oil money was a factor, but (1) that was not the only factor, and I'd argue those above were more important; (2) oil money is not the same as "corporate dollars" as a whole and is not equally distributed between the parties;
2474 2018-07-17 18:51:31 I’m obsessed with lush so that’s all i get and these are my faves:
1) coconut hand scrub 
2) coffee face mask
3) damaged hot oil hair mask
4) BIG SHAMPOO!!! (Their best product) 
5) rub a dub rub body scrub (had a sample and was obsessed)
2475 2018-07-17 18:51:27 accidentally got whole bean coffee (no grinder) got creative and used a baggie of beans and a sturdy olive oil bottle to roll, crush, and grind down the beans enough to brew up. Taking the rest of the bag to be ground proper later but lol, it worked! Persistence wins.

2488 2018-07-17 18:50:26 Walt, I think President Obama did many good things and is a man of good character. However, low gas prices came about in spite of his administration. The improvements in high pressure drilling created the additional oil and gas resources we enjoy today

2494 2018-07-17 18:49:31 Just stop—you’re embarrassing yourself.  1) USA already exports lots of oil. 2) Low oil prices don’t drive a spike in demand. If they did, we would have seen a spike when prices dropped to $25/bbl.

2531 2018-07-17 18:45:58 The US sanctions on Russia are not comprehensive, as with Iran. Rather, the sanctions are focused on specific persons/companies in Russia and on certain sectors of Russia's economy, including the oil and gas sector. Civil aviation is not a prohibited sector.

2550 2018-07-17 18:43:29 Okay! Galy pr sarson k oil ki malish krain, koi handkerchief le kr achi trha gila krain or all around your neck achi trha bandh lain! Do that for 2-3 nights gala bilkul theek ho jy ga
2551 2018-07-17 18:43:27 bio oil HOURLY
2552 2018-07-17 18:43:14 What’s your lube of choice? I use a bit of vegetable oil, lasts for hours.
2553 2018-07-17 18:43:07 Libya had zero debt with the world bank, zero debt with the IMF. Used revenue from their oil resource to provide unparalleled services for its people. I know your ilk don't take kindly to Africans who do not need you, and that's the crux of your dislike for him.
2554 2018-07-17 18:43:06 The better people understand a tool or a tactic, the better they are usually able to articulate its limitations. It's a good way of distinguishing genuine experts from people who sell snake oil.
2555 2018-07-17 18:43:04 Actually there’s lots of evidence (hence my suggestion that you may want to learn more about OPEC, supply, demand & prices in world oil markets). It appears your motive is “not in my backyard”-based because there is zero impact on consumption/FF burn.
2556 2018-07-17 18:43:02 Almond oil is so essential to my life
2557 2018-07-17 18:42:58 My nephew just tracked dirty motor oil on my carpet. Googled how to remove the stain, but that didn't work.  Got my out Norwex cloth and cleaning paste and it all came out with very little effort!  Thanks, #Norwex!  You work miracles!!
2558 2018-07-17 18:42:38 & that box be slippery like trying to walk on oil
2559 2018-07-17 18:42:30 And demand for Russia oil grew by?
2560 2018-07-17 18:42:27 This is the summer of leafy greens and coconut oil
2561 2018-07-17 18:42:27 Loved it! You needed to jazz it up a bit and cooked some stew with it! Plum tomatoes, onions, magi cubes, Pepe, a little palm oil, liquidised cooked and wha-la! I can see a cook off coming on!
2562 2018-07-17 18:42:11 す
2563 2018-07-17 18:42:10 The dawn dish soap commercial with all the animals being washed off from the oil spill makes me sob.
2564 2018-07-17 18:42:08 This is what it's all about. The deep state wants war with Russia. A win over Russia makes us the sole Hyper power with control of upwards of 80% of the world's oil. Our reserve currency again regains economic might... Or something. Ha
2565 2018-07-17 18:41:55 @mangan150 what's your opinion on extra-virgin olive oil (mechanically cold extracted), I know ur opinion on seed oil but I'm Spanish and olive oil is a cornerstone in our kitchen...and I love it! :-p
2566 2018-07-17 18:41:43 Hope to chat with u more at Bloomington speedway n if u ain’t busy grab pic with ya
2567 2018-07-17 18:41:32 #bblf #bb20 the switched from sams spa to crazy kaitlyns oil session i’m pissed
2568 2018-07-17 18:41:24 Let me guess, you had no clue the crazy Katy Christian quack who hawks his own snake oil was behind this and every similar move dating back to the 80s.
2569 2018-07-17 18:41:17 interesting... everyone talks about building a personal brand so you can sell anything. I believe whatever you sell is a representation of who you are as a person.  So be careful what you represent... I guess everyone forgot about the snake oil salesman syndrome
2570 2018-07-17 18:41:16 Use some Vaseline or oil. If you have 2 push one through the top and the other through the bottom at the same time...
2571 2018-07-17 18:41:15 I’ve ordered a Sicilian - chicken, Cajun, seasoning, red onion, pepper pearls and chilli oil on an Italian base
2572 2018-07-17 18:41:15 It's a mistake to talk of Europe writ large, and the EU. Chances Western Europe would sell out Eastern Europe if push came to shove w/ Russia? Especially if they get more hooked on Russian oil? It ain't them would stand up for Eastern Europe.
2573 2018-07-17 18:41:06 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
2574 2018-07-17 18:40:56 Someone buy me an oil for my pen for my bday 
2575 2018-07-17 18:40:51 FYI, Kelcy Warren is Trans Pecos Pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners, in other words, an oil magnate and not interested in #ClimateAction
2576 2018-07-17 18:40:51 In the time the minivan needs a $40 oil change it's got $1300 in payments. Oil changes are not so frequent or expensive FFS. And you don't have a real choice.
2577 2018-07-17 18:40:46 They are lovely. I don't think I could ever get tired of pasta or potatoes with nice olive oil and herbs.
2578 2018-07-17 18:40:34 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2579 2018-07-17 18:40:34 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2584 2018-07-17 18:40:11 Must agree with the description of the oil @Afrocenchix. Bought mine at the @LNLYshow and have tried it for 1 week now and the oil is light, penetrating and keeps my hair oh so smoothe.fresh 2day curls? Spritz n go. #goodbuy #SBOB #teamnatural #happynaturalista #naturalhaircare

2586 2018-07-17 18:40:09 i even brew my own craft ghoul oil, it’s very hoppy
2587 2018-07-17 18:40:06 You do it in a frying pan with oil or without oil and how long do you let it get hot before you put the tuna steak on it and how long it...
2588 2018-07-17 18:39:57 Sasse the snake oil salesman in a nice suit. Remember this one in 2020. Vote him out.
2589 2018-07-17 18:39:40 Coconut oil does nothing for my hair on its own. I have to mix it in with my deep conditioner to get any of that magic y’all talk about 
2590 2018-07-17 18:39:38 Stop criticizing.
2591 2018-07-17 18:39:32 the vampire store is a major competitor of mine, they are a soulless corporation i offer down home good ole fashioned ghoulish oil blood transfusions
2592 2018-07-17 18:39:24 Thought I'd treat myself to an oil change done by someone else.Scheduled for an hr ago. Now I'm about to miss my coach at media days. Lesson learned

2594 2018-07-17 18:39:16 How dare you not carry olive oil in an outpatient pharmacy in a hospital! 
2595 2018-07-17 18:39:15 Thanks, I've never used almond oil for my face. Will try that.
2596 2018-07-17 18:39:10 I’m scared to do that because last time it came on my car was out of oil
2597 2018-07-17 18:38:56 Rep Gianforte talking about energy resources on Native land while highlighting the economic difficulties we face.

Fuck off, I see you. You'd have the last vestiges of Indigenous lands given away to be pillaged for oil and leave us scattered if it meant you could get a cut of it.
2598 2018-07-17 18:38:45 one time i went over to my exes place and he had a bottle of truffle oil in his pantry and i’d never been so happy to not be dating someone
2599 2018-07-17 18:38:44 I just asked my manager who happens to be a black man if he bled the same color as me and I meant a different shade of red. Lmao. This guy said "no Myrah, I bleed oil because I'm black" I cant even deal.

2601 2018-07-17 18:38:37 Someone introduce Liz Truss to the concept of argan oil or serum or something, that fluff makes my follicles hurt
2602 2018-07-17 18:38:17 PSA: 

If you have a bug bite and you don’t have anti itch cream: use lavender, ginger, or basil essential oil or aloe vera. They’re for anti inflammatory properties and reducing itching. You can also make a concoction of the oil and aloe for prolonged healing! Rt to save a life.
2603 2018-07-17 18:38:16 Have an office based focal point visit the platforms interacting with all trades then present what they find, it might show how it takes everyone to get the oil and remove some of the onshore/offshore friction.
2604 2018-07-17 18:38:11 I love olive oil and balsamic on bread omg sob, that looks beautiful 
2605 2018-07-17 18:38:10 Mine used to do that too. But I mixed a little of grape seed oil with my brush cleaner and it's never happened again. After a few times of washing them with that mixture, they always hold their shape.
2606 2018-07-17 18:38:03 Crappy? Are you high? I put 200k on mine with less than $5k in costs, including oil/tires
2607 2018-07-17 18:37:58 You know you’re tired when you put your oil and quorn pieces in the pan and then start doing something else before you finally realise it’s helpful if you turn the hob on! #fail
2608 2018-07-17 18:37:48 I'm currently using a yogurt, ACV, oil and honey mask. Yenza kakhulu mtase, my hair is a lot softer, there's less shedding and less dry scalp.
2609 2018-07-17 18:37:46 tree oil has never done me wrong
2610 2018-07-17 18:37:38 For soup, cook minced ginger in oil, then simmer with tempeh, garam masala, mushroom broth and chilis. Top with lime juice.
2611 2018-07-17 18:37:36 My question is, when are women gonna start liking dudes that can do something useful like cut your grass, change ya oil, cook YOU dinner, fix up the house.. y’all just let me know lmao
2612 2018-07-17 18:37:30 hey everyone just wanted to let you all know im going to be providing a new service on my Etsy page where if you pay me 30 dollars i will drain all of the blood out of your body and replace it with ghoulish black oil
2613 2018-07-17 18:37:26 Yet Germany is buying its oil from Russia. Germany also expects US to keep protecting it at our expense and puts large tariffs on our goods while we have kept our tariffs much lower. Germany treats Russian better than it does the US. Explain that Mr. Senate Majority Leader!

2615 2018-07-17 18:36:48 Even if we may tune out (I already don't watch fox news) his base still tunes in. How else can we work to dry the oil in that machine of lies?
2616 2018-07-17 18:36:45 @BettyCrocker I just bought a couple of your packets tray bake products. Lemon buttery shortcrust and salted caramel brownie mix. We have to add eggs, water and fat. WE add the fat - why do YOU add palm oil? Why don’t you use sustainable palm oil? (Or add least state that you do)

2618 2018-07-17 18:36:25 See!? It doesn’t hurt to change that oil! 
2619 2018-07-17 18:36:08 I heavily feel all of @Oil_Guns_Merica’s tweets  if I didn’t have 20K in student loans of my own, I would def help a brotha out
2620 2018-07-17 18:36:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2621 2018-07-17 18:36:03 You are absolutely correct. The problem is that when the cause is external, people just change behaviour (eg 70s oil crisis). When the cause is due to government policy, too many get very angry and vote out the government.
2622 2018-07-17 18:36:03 Does he though? While he still tries to undercut the Mueller investigation? Sell your snake oil somewhere else

2625 2018-07-17 18:35:18 In 2017
The #world consumed 97.1 million barrels of #oil.

Including 26 million barrels of #gasoline for cars.

And 15 million barrels were converted to #petrochemicals
#OOTT #OPEC
2626 2018-07-17 18:35:16 I was referring to all consumption globally.  We have the third largest oil reserve, and you’re suggesting that not extracting it will make a difference to consumption. It won’t. OPEC would simply crack open a few valves to fill the void.
2627 2018-07-17 18:35:04 Just had a massage. 
My shoulders were so jacked up. 
Feeling better. 
But no heated blanket and cold oil? And excuse me wasn't this a 60 minute message not 45 minutes??? 
Gotta go where I usually go to get the royal treatment.

2632 2018-07-17 18:34:54 I don’t fuck with people who think olive oil is an adequate salad dressing

Why does it have to be so damn expensive :(
2634 2018-07-17 18:34:47 @Thom_Hartmann &

2642 2018-07-17 18:33:22 You may want to read about OPEC in managing the supply of oil globally. Hint: it has nothing to do with how much can be brought to market.
2643 2018-07-17 18:33:20 Oil is always a curse in Africa and Kenya is no different
2644 2018-07-17 18:33:20 This guy at my job was telling me about how he makes fried chicken every night and he was like “yeah it’s pretty simple, just chicken breast and vegetable oil” he doesn’t bread it...just adds a little salt and drops it into a pot of hot oil....yes, he is.
2645 2018-07-17 18:33:17 Someone needs massage black seed oil on to the tl for about 10 minutes to sooth it because the way it's looking right now

2655 2018-07-17 18:32:15 You kill my nostrils with Patchouli Oil stench.
2656 2018-07-17 18:32:06 What made Libya to be "First class" country was because it had a brave leader. Zuma had at least 8 years to follow the suit. What did he do? Nothing. But today you sing him praises. Did we have absolute control of our minerals like Libya did with its oil, no...

2662 2018-07-17 18:31:45 The only way you can break it is by screwing the filter on too tight. They were the only people doing my oil changes so I know they’re the ones that broke it.
2663 2018-07-17 18:31:43 But hopefully this growth oil speeds things up

2667 2018-07-17 18:31:06 Once Dangote finishes the plant. He would be the lord of oil business. The biggest most advanced refinery in the world. He can daily refine beyond the consumption of Nigeria. What can others do other than lobby for distribution and marketing?
2668 2018-07-17 18:31:05 Yeah. Because the vegetables in the salad are supposed to have flavor. You're not supposed to have to artificially add flavor. Olive oil and salt is all you need.
2669 2018-07-17 18:30:52 Thought I was billy big bollocks today didn’t I and went all out with the oil 
2670 2018-07-17 18:30:52 Their secret lies in the potatoes they use. Basebenzisa fresh potatoes from the market that are peeled and cut there and not the prepackaged embalmed pre-cut frozen chips that every1 else uses. Then fried in that oil okade kulama russian,liver,meatballs esh

2690 2018-07-17 18:28:29 Not to mention that Europe has its fair share of natural resources including natural gass, crude oil and a rather large agricultural industry.

2695 2018-07-17 18:28:13 I just spilled half a gallon of olive oil on my kitchen floor LOL
2696 2018-07-17 18:28:09 หรือว่าน้องเคยเต้นให้พี่มาร์คดูในห้องกัน2คนงี้

2698 2018-07-17 18:28:04 Quaker State 10W40 motor oil works for me.
2699 2018-07-17 18:27:53 I've been cleansing with Origins A Perfect World Cleanser twice a day! (If not that then I'm using the Skinfood Rice Cleanser) Then I used the Ole Henriksen Truth Serum or the belif Water Essence and at night I used the Sunday Riley Luna oil and finished with a belif moisturizer!
2700 2018-07-17 18:27:43 All this things, it is when hot oil spills that you will know the importance of apron and kitchen wears!!!
2701 2018-07-17 18:27:33 IT WAS ELLA WHO SAID THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE PAN!!
2702 2018-07-17 18:27:30 Maybe, It's for you guys to decide your leaders. But one thing is for sure that you don't want the current regime ruling there because they're turning your nation into some Arabised Britain and one thing is for sure that anything Arabised is a curse except oil. :D :P
2703 2018-07-17 18:27:30 Hi have you tried something for instant relief I’ve been carrying the Breaze vapour oil it’s really handy.  Hope you find something that works. Can’t believe how bad this year has been!
2704 2018-07-17 18:27:29 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2705 2018-07-17 18:27:28 Hw many Ogoni people hv they compensated for the numerous oil spills on their land?
2706 2018-07-17 18:27:27 Ask Libyans - especially those who slaughtered him - how fine a leader he was. Terrible terrible abuse of power. Wonder how fine he would be had Libya little or no oil ...
2707 2018-07-17 18:27:12 Didn’t bring the coconut oil this year so it’s unlikely
2708 2018-07-17 18:27:11 How much is the oil and gas industry subsidized in canada? I presume you believe that should stop as well right?
2709 2018-07-17 18:27:02 I never knew that you were suppose to use baby oil while your skin still damp 
2710 2018-07-17 18:26:55 That is the same in Ontario.  Ontario is blessed with shale gas and we have oil and just need to research and develop it.
2711 2018-07-17 18:26:40 So your argument is that it’s Canadian oil we should shut down (because of perceived impacts from its extraction), and instead consume oil from other nations? Nations with environmental frameworks so poor that you won’t even see a report?
2712 2018-07-17 18:26:36 WAIT I KNOW WHY NOW IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WASNT ANY OIL LEFT IN THE PAN SO THE LAST TWO WHERE FUCKed up
2713 2018-07-17 18:26:27 Putin Puppet would be doing:

- Limit fracking
- Block oil & gas pipelines
- Cut US Military Spending
- Reduce Tensions with Iran

1. WHICH CANDIDATE Campaigned on that?  
2. WHOSE WH Administration DID JUST THAT?

ANSWERS:
1.  HILLARY
2.  President Barack OBAMA

McConnell
2714 2018-07-17 18:26:24 $$ is only thing bipartisan.
We need a little chaos solved by jailing people. New party(s) will form out of chaos.

The goverment is just a front:
Big Pharma, Big Oil, Old Money, Wall St, The Fed, Thin Blue Line, The Military, etc. will keep things chugging along.
2715 2018-07-17 18:26:24 They do not take care of their constitutents, BP spilled oil, lost money (bad for environment, shareholders,  emlpyees). Amazon, pays low wages, employees muct sign very broad noncompete clauses, no benefits, bad workinging conditions, bad for employees.
2716 2018-07-17 18:26:19 But I thought the price of oil was up?
2717 2018-07-17 18:26:14 The anointing oil of King Jesus alone burns up all the law of the flesh for absolute heaven on earth to occur.
2718 2018-07-17 18:26:07 Nah fam.  Pit crew oil change is like $19.88 at Walmart in GV.  I've gotten it twice in the last couple months.
2719 2018-07-17 18:26:02 I just bought a Ps4, it will hold me over until oil reaches sub 50
2720 2018-07-17 18:26:02 I can imagine there would have been similar discussions when the first petrol vehicles appeared on the streets. Horse and cart owners would be wondering how pumping oil and processing it was cheaper than hay and oats for feed 
2721 2018-07-17 18:25:56 .....that still seems like a lot. The place I go to does a tire rotation along with the oil change
2722 2018-07-17 18:25:54 I just had what I think would be considered a very adult moment where I got very excited that avocado  oil mayo is only 10 more calories  Then light Mayo But is still 65 calories less than regular Mayo but tastes just as good... What have I become
2723 2018-07-17 18:25:50 yes ma’am to the castor oil 
2724 2018-07-17 18:25:22 @NennerResearch Hi Charles, just wondering if your cycle work is showing bullish sentiment for crude oil? It's dipped a bit recently.
2725 2018-07-17 18:25:17 I haven't even got through the first special stage and I'm already in oil ocean
2726 2018-07-17 18:25:17 Belated Unpopular Opinion post: non-bronzing highlighter on white people just looks like greasy skin tbh.

It does on me anyway.

Shine is bad anywhere but the crest of the cheekbone. Chins, noses and foreheads just look slick with oil. Greasy babes. 

To me anyway.
2727 2018-07-17 18:25:09 It's technically still positive, but it is not stronger. The bond yield is about invert, oil prices are rising, ag sector lost 30% of its business thanks to tariffs, corporate debt is too high, stock buybacks are artificially buoying the market... Winter is coming.

2729 2018-07-17 18:24:59 Just had a patient ask for Olive Oil and get mad that we don’t have it...really can’t make this stuff up. #wtf
2730 2018-07-17 18:24:54 I liked Trump's idea to sue the EU.  We only joined it illegally anyway. It was always designed to be a federal Euro-Arabia from De Gaulle's early Euro-Arab Dialogues. Now we have #BarcelonaDeclaration #MarrakeshDeclaration allowing free movement in return for Saudi oil etc.
2731 2018-07-17 18:24:53 Jim, "may well" has as much credibility as "thoughts & prayers" when coming from Snake Oil Mitch.
2732 2018-07-17 18:24:39 She started pouring oil in the fire... don't believe this ladies words....big drama queen in this world, ever.. big liers........
2733 2018-07-17 18:24:28 I completely understand guys obsession with trucks I just took my fiancé @ChevyTrucks  for an oil change and I want one !!!!
2734 2018-07-17 18:24:26 Which POTUS sent fleets to the Balkans, sent US Armor back to Germany, issued heavy sanctions on Russia, bombed Syria killing Russian soldiers, lifted oil export restrictions to decrease dependency of European nations on Russia? Yeah, that was Trump.

2736 2018-07-17 18:24:23 I can't remember the last time i saw pink oil with my eyes. 
2737 2018-07-17 18:24:22 Tooo fucking long  4 hours for an oil change ? Where they do that at 
2738 2018-07-17 18:24:11 This is powerful.  I built an early career in predictive oil and gas in the frac space.  hundreds of variables.  complex stuff.  
I realized early on that there is a ton of fluff out there that doesn't predict.  
Your model of the past partially informs your model of the future
2739 2018-07-17 18:24:09 Where can you get pure castor oil at?
2740 2018-07-17 18:24:04 Start buying up olive oil, mozzarella, balsamic, and rioja and we can have underground do you remember Europe meets', marvelling at our holiday snaps, before we return to the regulation Anglo-Saxon gruel.
2741 2018-07-17 18:24:04 I get synthetic oil.. along with tire rotations /: ...75$ from tireman. & that’s with a 5$ discount 
2742 2018-07-17 18:23:48 Again, it’s not about production...it’s about consumption (demand).  As long as demand continues to grow, oil *will* be produced. Period.  So again, would you prefer it from Canada or elsewhere?
2743 2018-07-17 18:23:47 You do realise that the US is the third largest crude oil exporter globally behind Russia and Saudi...
2744 2018-07-17 18:23:31 Toatally agree, England westminster have the sole focus on Independent England, not interested in union with Scotland ( it's only a strategic asset as Faslane,some contributions from Oil)
2745 2018-07-17 18:23:26 I most certainly do! Plus ever since researching keto, low carb, and bulletproof coffee and bulletproof tea, I've also been adding one to two teaspoons of coconut oil to my tea
2746 2018-07-17 18:23:21 That wild hair growth oil shit has the worst smell but it’s been making my hair grow
2747 2018-07-17 18:23:09 I see the English media is trying to knock Harry Kane even after winning the Golden Boot and doing well with England. Ungratefull. Let's do a trade then. Norway gets Harry Kane and England gets Norways oil income for as long as he plays for us. Everybody will be happy! 
2748 2018-07-17 18:23:05 Can’t see since I blocked, but went through TL’s & translated them; lots of talk of God, martyrs, jihad, etc.  Seems to me subscribing to overthrowing a sovereign secular nation for a fundamentalist Theocracy.  They wanna do that? Do it on your own. US just wants oil (like Iraq).

2751 2018-07-17 18:22:51 If we generate that, which means we can hit N1trn by December. FIRS said they generated 2.5trn too in 6mnths, which means 5trn in a year. Revenue from oil proceeds will surely reach atleast 4trn...Why are we still borrowing to fund the budget?
2752 2018-07-17 18:22:49 It’s busy  someone wanna do my oil change lol
2753 2018-07-17 18:22:49 Bringing thousand of refugees from all over including places that would love 2 kill us and our kids is not safe. There are many who just want to save their families and many who want to hurt us. Going after oil, pharmaceutical, medical, and automotive industries hurts employment
2754 2018-07-17 18:22:48 Damn bruh I came in for an oil change and I’m leaving with 2 new tires  ugh okay just take all my moneyz
2755 2018-07-17 18:22:47 'Occupied'. Norwegian show about Russia doing a friendly invasion of Norway when they decide to turn off the oil taps and switch to green energy. 
'Marcella'. British show about this crazy ass cop that has memory blanks and does messed up shit
2756 2018-07-17 18:22:45 I work there too !! And it was just an experience ahaha we changed the oil right after. I think in every country there’s very strict rules in McDonald’s
2757 2018-07-17 18:22:34 Indeed. The collective PR of the oil industry is pretty poor in stating its case.
2758 2018-07-17 18:22:23 My point is Hydrogen not oil.
2759 2018-07-17 18:22:20 Almond oil, hemp seed oil, castor oil

2763 2018-07-17 18:21:41 Germany doesn’t get 60% of its energy from Russia. It gets 60% from foreign sources, about 20% of oil and gas from RU.
2764 2018-07-17 18:21:39 Do you need a lot of cooking oil? Yes? Coconut or sesame?
2765 2018-07-17 18:21:16 $CEI This little thing has been like a thorn in my side so as soon as we see a pop back in the 50-60 range I’m taking a loss and never looking back at the stock.  We’ll give it a week and see what happens because of all the world news going on and the questions for oil
2766 2018-07-17 18:21:16 People still use pink oil???

Good evening Baba UtO on the MIC. 
SUGARMAN the way Chelsea is going right now, they will discover oil with a lightered stick of ciga(in Igbo)
2768 2018-07-17 18:20:57 Had a customer go 27K miles without changing the oil. I didn’t know you needed to change the oil on a new car. Well, now you know
2769 2018-07-17 18:20:57 What about the slavery in South America? The black slave traders selling slaves in Africa? The Persian slave trade? What’s wrong with refineries? Do you not want oil? And what’s wrong with mills? Do you not want flour?
2770 2018-07-17 18:20:44 Hahahaha it’s like you are being flung out of an oil painting! Cool effect. Looks like you are having a blast! 
2771 2018-07-17 18:20:18 Damn, I need a new THC oil connect 
2772 2018-07-17 18:20:15 Libs seem to suffer from amnesia 
2773 2018-07-17 18:20:15 I’m not disputing climate change, or that fossil fuels contribute to it.  I’m disputing your notion that having Canada produce less oil would have any impact whatsoever on how much fossil fuels are burned in Canada or globally.
2774 2018-07-17 18:20:13 Was she hit by a driver of that vehicle or changing the oil?
2775 2018-07-17 18:20:07 Owning a million dollar super car is just not practical. Yes they are really cool but guess what you need an oil change? Yea that’s gonna be a $20,000 job... if you want to do it yourself your gonna have to take apart the majority of the car to do so.
2776 2018-07-17 18:19:58 Then why are they buying oil from them instead of us
2777 2018-07-17 18:19:53 interviewer: and how did you make your fortune

me: i crushed a bunch of andy capp's hot fries into shea butter and coconut oil and sold it as a "facial exfoliator for TOUGH GUYS"
2778 2018-07-17 18:19:52 Here's how I do it...  Drive to Walmart and tell em you want the pit crew oil change.  $20 and 45 mins later it's magically done!
2779 2018-07-17 18:19:43 We should build refineries in Alberta, refine it all in Alberta and infuse it into the Canadian market.

Then take the profits from that and invest in renewable energy to help that industry take over and then eventually shut down the oil sands.
2780 2018-07-17 18:19:39 Where are you getting it done at and for how much? It also depends on the oil you're getting, but it still shouldn't be that much.
2781 2018-07-17 18:19:33 Try almond oil, Neutrogena hydro boost moisturizer, try Beauty Formula products too.
2782 2018-07-17 18:19:31 I know minister of the ENVIRONMENT and all but shouldn't the job entail more than just trying to be Canada's sunshine on twitter. There is this whole issue with our oil resources and an inhumane country we give our power to......
2783 2018-07-17 18:19:23 I cured my kids eczema with coconut oil - am not saying that all kids will be cured but it worked for my kids.............no drs trips or useless precriptions in 8 years. 
I can only tell you that as my experience. 1.
2784 2018-07-17 18:19:21 It will be broken anyway if Jason Kenny has his way.  Albertans by and large ( thankfully not all) have been so captured by Big Oil that they have totally lost sight of the damage they are doing. Time long past to diversify their economy.
2785 2018-07-17 18:19:15 Exactly. Trump though thinks we should have kept their money and stole their oil. Yeah he is something else that is not good.
2786 2018-07-17 18:19:14 Melt butter with garlic in skillet best if iron one,
Add scallops, brown both sides each for abour a minute.
Then pour the juice from the bag the scallops came in, into the skillet reduce heat to simmer cover and let simmer for 15 minutes. They will be done and not rubbery
2787 2018-07-17 18:19:05 It took months, @netanyahu, to cut oil & gas supplies to Gaza, #Hamas... This is not just negligence. You prove too soft, time and again.

2789 2018-07-17 18:18:57 Because we have trillions of barrels of shale oil and don't need anyone. Interesting how the anti-fracking money came from Russia, obviously because of the natural gas reserves. Thoughts?

2794 2018-07-17 18:18:16 I’ve been waiting for my car to get it’s oil changed for an hour 30 and I’m getting so hangry.
2795 2018-07-17 18:18:00 Funny how you met with oil rich people then boom our petrol prices increase for 3 months in a row. Is that of the deal? We no longer "thuma" you. Sit down we will go on our own. Thank you!

2806 2018-07-17 18:16:51 Lmaooooo! I was in secondary school the last time I saw Pink Oil
Junior secondary the last time I used it!
2807 2018-07-17 18:16:37 Please tell me why I can’t go get my oil changed and JUST get my oil changed? Why does there always have to be six other thing that need to be fixed like I stg they be back there beating the crap outta my car so they can have other things to charge me for.
2808 2018-07-17 18:16:29 Promise made, promise kept. The everyday American loves Trump, oil, steel and coal booming, jobs coming back, Embassy move, protecting the 2nd, two qualifed SCOTUS picks. Red Wave incoming.
2809 2018-07-17 18:16:27 Starting from u
2810 2018-07-17 18:16:27 Since so much oil comes out of Alaska all residents get a fixed income as a way to keep them or attract people. It can change annually based upon what they drill, but I believe it’s pretty substantial.
2811 2018-07-17 18:16:26 Does it not seem like a waste of tax dollars to pay an anti oil activist as well as using tax dollars to buy a pipeline?
2812 2018-07-17 18:16:24 Interesting Facts About Jelly Fish oil perfume)
2813 2018-07-17 18:16:12 France would disagree ,you are paying for that oil from arabs ,eu is secure ,they will be no more wars on european soil
2814 2018-07-17 18:16:04 Also I have learnt that 0.5% or something of oil and gas income in Brazil has to be spent on public R&D, so there are some crazy amazing engineering facilities here.
2815 2018-07-17 18:16:03 Pink Oil? In 2018?

2817 2018-07-17 18:15:59 Price of gas is dictated by the price of oil not the president.  Gas was at one time the highest ever under Obama, wasn’t his fault either.
2818 2018-07-17 18:15:56 Funny how @abc @nbc @cbs @cnn @MSNBC are all running the same clips. Kind of like 21 newspapers all getting the same form letter about obstructing Kavanagh for SCOTUS. One might come to the conclusion that collusion is going on. @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @PressSec #KAG
2819 2018-07-17 18:15:55 600,000 gallons equals olympic sized swimming pool
3-5 million gallons each frack
& hose pipe ban is likely y because fracking corporations when they start will steal from our babies mouths potable water and pollute it forever
Work that into the price of gas and oil avid believer
2820 2018-07-17 18:15:52 I think you didn't watch the #HelsinkiCall.
@realDonaldTrump has no intention to de-escalate the Syrian situation, despite DNC convinced Trump is commanded by Putin.
It's all about who is going to sell oil and gas to #Europe.

2826 2018-07-17 18:15:24 Bill presents himself as a new age Samuel ready to drip anointing oil on our future leadership but he just can’t help himself. He can only be himself with this attempted linking of the left & this scary baby on the right. Naaaah brah, this is all yours on the Conservative RIGHT

2829 2018-07-17 18:15:13 #WorstSummerJob No choice but to take job as nurses' aide at convalescent center. Had to Keri Oil a patient w/skin condition.  Used the whole bottle. When done, patient asked for bedpan.  She was so slippery, the bedpan shot out from underneath her like a missile.  Very bad day.
2830 2018-07-17 18:15:06 coconut oil doesn’t work for my skin or my hair so i usually stay away from it. im gonna try it again though

2838 2018-07-17 18:14:02 He's not exactly an oil painting himself! What preposterous pettiness. Oh and #everydaysexism too. The fact that he can say it and get it reported... Oh sorry I forgot we'd gone back to 1818...
2839 2018-07-17 18:14:00 Put pumpkin seed oil on everything. You’re welcome.
2840 2018-07-17 18:13:55 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
2841 2018-07-17 18:13:54 You know your cat lived in the West End of #Glasgow for long enough when he cries to eat houmous and a treat is extra virgin olive oil... #hipstercat
2842 2018-07-17 18:13:46 Why didn’t you ever hold NATO accountable for their “fair share”? Did you just bash #PresidentTrump or did you ask NATO why we are protecting them with our money and they are getting a free ride? Did you ask why Germany is Paying Russia for oil? #LazySenator

2844 2018-07-17 18:13:36 That also assumes that the electric is produced from coal, what about solar, wind, tide and even nuclear etc? Can’t keep relying on oil for ever, need to start the change at some point. Yes I still run a petrol car!
2845 2018-07-17 18:13:36 musical chairs but with oil on the floor
2846 2018-07-17 18:13:35 Remember, You Ain’t Said Nothing Slick To a Can Of Oil.
2847 2018-07-17 18:13:28 I made the mistake of subscribing to the show in the mistaken thought that removing the adds for prepper crap and snake oil would make the show better.  All it actually showed me was that the show is total garbage now.  I haven't listened to more than a few minutes in months.
2848 2018-07-17 18:13:22 I've delayed getting an oil change for not a vine compilation there's a label last quarter.
2849 2018-07-17 18:13:20 washed my hands 3 times and they still smell like cbd oil
2850 2018-07-17 18:13:20 The money  drugs, gold and oil of Venezuela can buy anything else.
2851 2018-07-17 18:13:15 Full disclosure: I just went heavy on the olive oil to keep it from sticking. We've got a really crappy gas stove, so it has absolutely no chill.
2852 2018-07-17 18:13:12 I need to finally get new brushes and oil paint and get back into that mode. I'm feeling so sad that i basically gave up when i lost motivation.

2858 2018-07-17 18:12:01 i heard about that i think it’s called oil pulling, (i could be wrong) but i’m curious now so i think i’m gonna try what you do
2859 2018-07-17 18:11:59 Is it they're in denial, or is the oil lobby too damn big in this country?  I'd bet the latter
2860 2018-07-17 18:11:58 Plenty of fabulous rapeseed oil produced locally xx
2861 2018-07-17 18:11:54 did my whole skin care routine and oil treatment for my hair tonight, probs won’t happen for weeks again but it felt good to feel accomplished for a night lolz

2866 2018-07-17 18:11:34 "Nation" instead of "Alaska"is surprising...but oil and minerals are your specialty.

2869 2018-07-17 18:11:16 They can leave, fully support our Turkana brothers, they invested in exploring for oil they should invest in having a refinery there, otherwise no one is gaining anything the Turkanas nor the rest of Kenyans

2873 2018-07-17 18:11:11 Gotta disagree.  I had a blockage a few weeks ago where any air pressure change like yawning, was screwdriver painful.  A few drops of grapeseed oil, waiting a min or two for it to warm, then a few drops of peroxide until it stopped bubbling twice a day worked in 3 days.
2874 2018-07-17 18:10:58 A few things have changed. The USSR was defeated by sending them bearings off round, oil containing sand, coding loaded with viruses and an attack on their money. Are we now surprised Russia attack our weak election process.

2877 2018-07-17 18:10:41 The scent of a random persons hair oil brought back memories of my grand father who probably used the same oil. It’s simply marvellous how effective the sense of smell is in time traveling!

2880 2018-07-17 18:10:12 I've seen refrig, washers, sofas, dining room furniture, end tables and more on the 610 around Houston. At least that was the case in 2014 when I spent 6 months working in the Magellan Oil Terminal right off of 610.

2882 2018-07-17 18:09:58 The guy reason the quantity of oil e go consume 
2883 2018-07-17 18:09:49 So this would appear to indicate 75% oil 25% sanctions. Not far off what I would've guessed. Thanks.

2886 2018-07-17 18:09:17 Danggg the most I can tell you is make sure your hair is damp instead of wet when you do it, don’t overseparate your sections when you take them down n make sure you put oil in your hands when you take them down to avoid frizz and maybe trying a diff curling enhancement product.
2887 2018-07-17 18:08:55 Cooked in death inducing peanut oil
2888 2018-07-17 18:08:51 Did anybody reliable say that was likely? They may have chosen to believe a bunch of charlatans selling them Brexit snake oil, but they cannot have been unaware of the warnings.

2891 2018-07-17 18:08:40 A tip: ladies use coconut oil for taking off ur makeup! It’s $5 and lasts forever. Can also be used as a moisturizer
2892 2018-07-17 18:08:13 Never topically applied it. But it helps if the good boy/girl allows it. We just had so much success with the loaded cookies. I emulsified my rso with coconut oil & lecithin also to help with bioavailability/absorption
2893 2018-07-17 18:08:11 I had just enough oil & limejuice to save it - but it was close & I had to be very disciplined.
2894 2018-07-17 18:07:58 Lmaoooooo! Wait, they still produce pink oil? I haven’t seen that stuff since 2007 or so.
2895 2018-07-17 18:07:56 Yes its a huge problem,........ globally actually. It just changes forms as you move around the world. Least the corruption is mainly local and south africa is not bombing other countries for oil. So in bigger picture south africa still a goodie country actually

2897 2018-07-17 18:07:53 3. DIY BUBBLE BATH
-Mix 1/2 cup of hand soap or body soap (in a good scent). 
-Add one tablespoon of honey to moisturize your skin. 
-Add one tablespoon of oil, like almond oil, olive oil
-Add an egg white, to make the bubbles fluffier and last longer!

2909 2018-07-17 18:06:03 A free second term for Trumpzilla..... Sigh

Although, on the other hand, every year Agent Orange and his political antics continue, is a year the United States of Oil Imperialism isn't killing millions, so that's a plus.

2916 2018-07-17 18:04:43 Russia, at best, is a 2nd rate country with oil.  Without it, they are a 3rd rate country.

I’m sure you heard what I heard, there’s only one thing that Putin is afraid of and he said it yesterday, the price of oil
2924 2018-07-17 18:04:13 Scandinavian Capitalism doesn’t “include” the welfare state.
Scandinavian capitalism supports the welfare state
Venezuela started its downward spiral when the means of production was seized.
Including oil production

2927 2018-07-17 18:04:06 Ok. But do we know how much of the current crisis is oil related vs sanctions related. Obviously both had an impact, but which one was more important?

Socialism does not require you to mine your own oil for your fake fur.
2935 2018-07-17 18:03:08 I work hard - but I make sure I don't quite work as hard as you.
I pay tax - Tory leader says I pay more tax in Scotland than in England.
I dont get drunk, but good to see you admit England is bossy.

2938 2018-07-17 18:02:53 Calzones lack the required air flow and thus are also thermobaric bombs of cheese and grease that will put you in the hospital (you can’t even coat them in Parmesan and oregano to absorb oil and mitigate the risk of third degree burns)
2939 2018-07-17 18:02:48 Boil the rice for 15 mins and drain and put it back on very low heat (with a bit of oil at the bottom) for 25mins. You can't go wrong! even wit distraction lol

2943 2018-07-17 18:02:33 She definitely is embarrassing ! First she canned Oil and Gas in her big announcement with Greenpeace so she could announce it in her speech at UN -generational lies- then she tries to discredit the other leaders who are male so she can get on the feminism bandwagon - Helen clone
2944 2018-07-17 18:02:33 No there aren’t any middle class taxes except for the Trump middle class taxes that were passed last year by trump. The gas tax that @TheRealJohnHCox is running on was a GOP idea. User pays. Now it’s convenient to hate on it. Sorry to say you’re being conned by oil cos and Cox.
2945 2018-07-17 18:02:30 South Sudan peace has failed in Karhtoum but he had already deployed his troops to protect oil fields and compensations document is inked....we are in traps;Are we still seeing anything good coming from Sudan?

2949 2018-07-17 18:01:57 Who is behind this Ranchers or the Oil and Gas companies?  We are not foolish to believe either one of you are concerned with the ESA.
2950 2018-07-17 18:01:38 Russia's economy has been crippled by falling oil prices, I'm pretty sure, given that their GDP started rising again right around the time oil prices started to rise again.
2951 2018-07-17 18:01:34 I was thinking that it takes time as well as heat, between 90 and 110 minuets to decarboxylate  cannabis, so using extraction methods like rosin tech that only takes a few minuets or Co2 would allow you to make oil from any strain without the psychoactive effect. If desired
2952 2018-07-17 18:01:21 Awww thank you <3
2953 2018-07-17 18:01:21 My CRV getting her first oil chance today. So exciting lol.
2954 2018-07-17 18:01:18 That’s a shame too. There’s so much to do that isn’t oil related. Think of all that goes into agriculture, or a small business in the trades. The textile industry. 
Little effort is put into alternate energy resources. What if the well runs dry?

@metapixl: even in the bath, you’re a saucier 
2983 2018-07-17 17:58:05 Haha so you finally got your oil changed huh 
2984 2018-07-17 17:57:46 and next up, Azerbaijan. This country is full of oil their capital is Baku on the Caspian Sea. Putin invaded, took a slice of their country. Then he came to Ukraine. And again, no warning, no declaration of war, he grabbed the whole peninsula of Crimea.
2985 2018-07-17 17:57:44 Russians have always meddled in US elections, but Obama gov hyped it (&used CIs) to help HRC paint @realDonaldTrump as Putin puppet—

while helping US & foreign energy co in USA—which invested $billions in oil/NG export infrastructure since ‘08—get some of Russia’s mkts.

2987 2018-07-17 17:57:26 The oil that has sustained "saintly northern Nigeria" isn't it from d land of d so called  "infidel" ?? This is why Nigeria can't ever progress we relish in dividing ourselves; giving us a sense of supposed importance or superiority!
2988 2018-07-17 17:57:24 The US economy is driven most by Oil, Gas & the Military Industrial Complex, which creates the most Cancer causing Pollution in the World.  So, don't put it off on the individual people because that's a cop-out.  Getting rid of plastic straws is Not going to Save the World.
2989 2018-07-17 17:57:24 Trump brought up two valid pts with Merkel: Europe inc Germany must pay more for 75 yr old NATO agreement to protect Europe, & Germany is getting oil direct from Russia, bypassing EU Allies. Brilliant for Trump to call attn 2 this inequity
2990 2018-07-17 17:57:20 Oh yes! The sun warmed part is super important. I actually bought a bit of mozzarella, so I thought I'd do that 'drizzle a bit of olive oil & balsamic' thang. Is it terrible to admit I licked the container, and wished I had more?
2991 2018-07-17 17:57:15 We have Neck Oil in cans but we can look into keg! It's not quite nick oil but we have Gammeray coming on next!
2992 2018-07-17 17:57:07 Overreact  much?  The same people crying about Trump not believing our intelligence agencies are the same people who were claiming the same agency released false info about weapons of mass destruction so Bush could invade Iraq and steal their oil.
2993 2018-07-17 17:57:03 The issue is that Russia itself does not have interest to get prices to be super high as it would once again guarantee ANOTHER collapse as in 2014 due to overproduction thanks to the USA's shale oil/gas that can do serious harm only when oil prices are super high.
Let's see.
2994 2018-07-17 17:57:00 scars trading oil .. but was just an observation i don't like these 3x Lev. ETF .. but under normal circumstances red not green and the volume ... puuhi

3003 2018-07-17 17:56:10 Curse the asshole that always told me the hemi needed full synthetic oil because here I am paying 70 for a freaking oil change. Mind you, paying for an oil change in general grinds me gears.

But if you can find just pure jojoba oil that’s the best for your nails.& I scrub w any regular soap & a little nail brush from target
3006 2018-07-17 17:55:15 Sorry. This makes no sense. ”By working together, they can keep the global economy swimming in oil and gas.” The United States imports half of it’s daily oil requirement.

3008 2018-07-17 17:55:08 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.
3009 2018-07-17 17:55:06 Every assertion you’ve made; sugar and cancer, coconut oil curing eczema, you’re quoting figures on vaccines without saying where they’re from, doctors create allergies, you asserted that the material mesh was made from was toxic... where’s your evidence to support any of this?
3010 2018-07-17 17:54:49 I dont seem to recall the WSH doing that with Bush when his family were directly implicated in profiting off of oil with Saudis and Duck Chaney's exploits. 

You have to have credibility to lodge something like this, the WSJ has none.
3011 2018-07-17 17:54:35 Too funny. I just dragged one out of the closet and put batteries in it. Haven't tried it yet to see if it syncs with new phone. I say go for it!

3013 2018-07-17 17:54:06 No! I make it on the fly (but I haven't made it in so long), sort of the way it's done in Sichuan. Just drizzling on sesame oil, sesame paste, la jiao, black vinegar, touch of soy, splash of garlic-ginger juice, sprinkle of sugar. Then adjust to taste.

3039 2018-07-17 17:50:28 I'm actually curious how much of Russia's current economic woes are due to the falling price of oil rather than Obama's sanctions. 

I've seen some pundits say Russia's economy was crippled by US sanctions. Is that really accurate?

3041 2018-07-17 17:50:20 Why is oil plummeting. Trump is easing sanctions on the terrorist state of Iran. Why? He promised Putin who met with representatives of the regime days before meeting Trump.
3042 2018-07-17 17:50:07 US announced that United States will consider waivers on Iran sanctions to avert massive disruption of the global oil market.

3054 2018-07-17 17:48:50 We can’t compete on steel, especially now with Trump tariffing everything. If we had oil to drill we’d be doing it already. And as for opening the coal mines... that would be a good idea 50 years ago... wonder if the miners will work for a crust and a handshake
3055 2018-07-17 17:48:41 Oil up 40% with boss man Trump is why.  GDP WOULD BE LOWER IF oil was the the same as 2016.

3082 2018-07-17 17:45:44 There’s a man in front of me at the car dealership (I’m getting an oil change) and he’s scrolling thru his texts and nobody’s number is saved....it’s literally all numbers. I am tweaking.

3087 2018-07-17 17:45:22 I never knew an oil change take this long
3088 2018-07-17 17:45:17 Wouldn't this tax affect to the transportation sector anyway, since it would be levied on oil refineries?

3093 2018-07-17 17:44:14 ok then how about
1. the collapse of the fishery &the impact of oil&gas on our longterm ocean sustainability
2. carbon tax
3. outmigration
4. 20% unrate
5. dj composite workers who have been on strike for > a year
my list of grievances is p long &symbolic gestures is p low down
3094 2018-07-17 17:44:13 — waiting for them to finish with this oil change. I’m hungry. I haven’t eaten anything today. 
3095 2018-07-17 17:44:04 lmfao. y’all at least know how to check your oil?
3096 2018-07-17 17:43:40 The hidden truth is your party and tories have over 40 years near bankrupted a very oil rich country.
Let that sink in then ask yourself why you give such people your support.
Many ex labour voters like me did that.
You support liars and cheats Jenny

3098 2018-07-17 17:43:34 It’s about oil yes. It’s about Putin and Trump planning for controll of all European and Russian oil and keep an eye on Central Asia too.

What would Russia have to offer besides corruption, oil and natural gas?

The #OrangeAgent is begiled by #Putin's ruthless #autocracy #kleptocracy 
He wants the same for the #USA

3110 2018-07-17 17:42:09 Oh yeah, his regime did that a lot. He nationalised the entire oil sector in Iraq which was basically owned then by the US/UK - he leaned on the communists after eventually rejecting the pan-Arabism of Nasser / paid the price by being executed and supplanted by the Ba'ath party.
3111 2018-07-17 17:42:07 If I regret anything in my life it would have to be not taking a month off in high school to help clean the animals after the bp oil spill. My Franciscan sister friends would have understood and still passed me. Thanks dawn for bringing up these feelings in your commercial.

3115 2018-07-17 17:41:46 Many Putin-friendly parties in the West are against climate action, anti-renewables, and pro-fossil oil & gas. Fits well with Russia's economic structure too.

3118 2018-07-17 17:41:21 My weed cuisine skills are prodigious and only beginning to grow. I chill my infused oil in tiny heart-form ice cube trays, so I end up with little half-teaspoon, solid coconut oil 'weedhearts'. Dosing is hard with infusions but this makes it way easier

3127 2018-07-17 17:40:51 Remember when @BarackObama blasted @MittRomney, when the latter claimed in 2012 that Russia is big threat to US sovereign interests? 
Also Obama engineered partition of Ukraine and coddled Baltic nations, killed Syria for Sunni oil/gas to Europe

3132 2018-07-17 17:40:16 Exactly. My skillset applied to oil exploration pays easily 2-3 times what I can make as an environmental researcher. As a scientist, it often truly comes down to a choice between making money or living with principle.

3154 2018-07-17 17:38:22 Yes, the 400mil that Hillery got from them, your right @BlackWhiteBand or the fact that Nato was buying oil from the Russians? All Trump has done is point this out and you simply do not care. We here Would love to hear your evidence of collusion but you have none.

3162 2018-07-17 17:37:23 having a vehicle is like having a child from oil changes to maintence check ups its like jeeze louise girl you're getting expensive
3163 2018-07-17 17:37:18 haha we've given a hell of a lot more than that to the oil industry and got nada to show for it, meanwhile smart Norway managed their resource correctly and sits on a $ Trillion nest egg
3164 2018-07-17 17:37:15 2003 when we invaded Iraq to help corporations get their oil was also a very dark moment - took longer than a nuke, but over a million dead in the name of Capitalism (not to mention the hits from use of stolen fossil fuels).
3165 2018-07-17 17:37:06 - Shea moisture bath/massage oil
3166 2018-07-17 17:36:46 That was part of it. Texas oil men and defense contractors, their interests and his, were not about to let the war end. Some went from bankruptcy to untold wealth. And they weren't about to let that .
3167 2018-07-17 17:36:45 I don’t get feminism governed countries like German, they are shutting down their own nuclear energy generating sources, spend billions of €s buying oil & gas from Russia, then turn around bitch about Putin in NATO at the same time USA is funding NATO shady schemes. 
3168 2018-07-17 17:36:36 Plus you can increase the benefits of both if you add a teaspoon or two of coconut oil to green tea or coffee. Also to black tea, and coconut milk to tea and coffee alike

3174 2018-07-17 17:35:46 It's all a conspiracy, especially crude oil that we drill for. It's not dead organic matter that was buried since the Jurassic period. The earth is only 5,000 years old. Stay woke.
3175 2018-07-17 17:35:39 You open the coal mines up we dig for oil in the falklands we start producing steel again
3176 2018-07-17 17:35:20 The bottom line is there is deep corruption in our Government that needs to be uprooted. No one is arguing that Russia is an ally, @realDonaldTrump has imposed sanctions, expelled diplomats & closed consulates & is addressing EU dependence on Russian Oil & Gas. Your thesis fails.
3177 2018-07-17 17:35:16 When I worry about the bees being hot I remeber Clive de'Bryn saying in his book that he knew of a thriving colony in an oil drum in Jamaica
3178 2018-07-17 17:35:09 Meh... If only they cared enough about wild animal populations decimated (lands taken away, tortured in the illegal pet trade) by the palm oil industry. I have hope that they will move away from using this ingredient, though, which seems much more in line with their stated ethics
3179 2018-07-17 17:35:08 If coconut oil or breastmilk cant fix it, I’ve got nothing. #WordsToLiveBy
3180 2018-07-17 17:34:55 Not at all. I was actually a fan of Trumps and excited when he got elected. I actually like some of the things he was trying to do and his msg of America first, we all want a strong leader. He has become a joke. He’s a snake oil salesman. A fraud and a coward.

3183 2018-07-17 17:34:16 @PeterAttiaMD is MCT Oil a sensible and safe supplement for people on balanced diet doing moderate exercise? Is it just additional fat? Would you need to get carbs way down (short of keto) for any benefit?
3184 2018-07-17 17:34:14 100%. Love salt and pepper or a few drops of sesame oil and lime!
3185 2018-07-17 17:34:09 Much like OUR dependance on foreign oil?
3186 2018-07-17 17:34:05 Reminds me of the time the oil&gas analyst started a rumor that wouldn't go away about the impact of carbon pricing on the electricity price in AB based on the carbon content of coal...
3187 2018-07-17 17:33:59 I can't imagine the texture being right without roasted it or toasted it and using a lil coconut oil. I've never had it.

3192 2018-07-17 17:33:25 Gadaffi was a tyrant dictator who used rethoric to manipulate Africans while he stole his own people’s oil, opressed and imprisoned and abused them. Which is why they revolted, and killed him. Stop romanticizing abuse of power.

3194 2018-07-17 17:33:17 nothing subsidized like the oil business in Canada. But Norway sits on a $Trillion oil fund while 40 years of AB Conservative mismanagement gave everything to bigoil and zilch to Canadians

3197 2018-07-17 17:33:10 Russia via Black Sea ports. We have previously seen imports of Azeri oil via Ceyhan, Turkey.
3198 2018-07-17 17:32:57 No, no, no!!! We already have plenty of oil, produce tons of it, which only adds to pollution. We need wind farms, solar farms, roof top solar,  electric vehicles, light rail systems, less cars, more mass transit.
3199 2018-07-17 17:32:49 In Quebec’s example, it’s “take some transfer payments every single year”...but how do you rationalize continued global oil consumption growth against not producing oil in Canada?

3204 2018-07-17 17:32:21 Sylvester Stallone says:

3215 2018-07-17 17:30:34 Petroleum Engineers (PE’s) are not obsolete once the Oil Age comes to an end or the world stops using oil.

Petroleum Engineering is a discipline of several disciplines from Economics to Geology.

Here are some of the things I’ve seen PE’s do.

3218 2018-07-17 17:30:27 Getting my oil changed and it always makes me paranoid that they'll fuck my cheap ass car up that I definitely can't afford to fix
3219 2018-07-17 17:30:06 Yes, one more attempt to turn over public lands to private industry--this time the recreation industry. Should fit well with oil wells and cows that will cover public lands as a result of your devotion to energy dominance & total lack of interest-indeed opposition to conservation
3220 2018-07-17 17:29:56 She would NEVER say it to my face I guarantee you that!!! My man would handle her REAL QUICK! He is an Oil Rig company owner. She has NO IDEA who I am . And talking about my beautiful, sweet kids as if they are garbage human beings brought momma bear out. I would rip her UP.
3221 2018-07-17 17:29:48 Like I've said I bunch of times, not all of the snake oil salesman in this industry are anonymous warriorforum accounts - many are "industry leaders" who everyone is friends with, or pretend to be friends with based on the slight chance they might get a lead from them one day.

3224 2018-07-17 17:29:17 I paint oil too so I have to allow drying time, so about 2 weeks total turn around time.

3226 2018-07-17 17:29:13 Watching the game on an oil rig in India ....very quiet tonight :-))
3227 2018-07-17 17:29:09 Want to cut energy usage? Don't keep the price artificially low. Want to cut gasoline consumption and foreign oil imports? Let the price go up. People gradually get low usage electrical devices. People start car pooling to work, buying high milage cars and taking the train or bus
3228 2018-07-17 17:29:04 Getting an oil change finally 
3229 2018-07-17 17:28:43 Yes naman ahhahaha 
Sana oil
3230 2018-07-17 17:28:43 No one but the multi-national banks and fossil fuel companies will benefit from "exploring"/drilling for oil in OUR oceans. In fact, WE THE PEOPLE will suffer from more oil bespoiling the oceans and coasts and the deaths of entire ecosystems. #KeepItInTheGround
3231 2018-07-17 17:28:30 แมวเราก็กินอาหารเม็ดยากค่ะ ต้องเอาอาหารเปียกคลุกๆพวกนางถึงจะยอมกินจนเกลี้ยง หรือเวลาเทอาหารเม็ดพวกนาจะกินแค่ตอนเทใหม่ๆ ถ้าเททิ้งไว้นานๆกลิ่นมันจะหมด พวกนางก็ไม้กิน น่าฆ่าทิ้งมาก ฟฟฟ

3237 2018-07-17 17:27:12 It's more that many vegan products have coconut oil in, I don't mind either way! But I'm not trying to be vegan, just reducing dairy for the environment so I think some in the diet is OK...
3238 2018-07-17 17:26:49 Please kindly reply with accounts that sells fragrance oil, particularly Gardenia. Thank you!

3240 2018-07-17 17:26:49 ぽきも質問箱開放したら面白いネタぶち込んでくれるかな(お前じゃない)
3241 2018-07-17 17:26:46 Simple. Trump is compromised. We have allowed an agent of Russia into the WH. The evidence was there all along. But the GOP is also soaked in Russian oil deals and are afraid for their own skins. This is why GREED is one of the 7 deadly sins.
3242 2018-07-17 17:26:43 Nowadays the way some girls like boys with Cars....

It seems they were Breastfeed with Engine Oil.
3243 2018-07-17 17:26:36 Do they restain/oil it as well?
3244 2018-07-17 17:26:33 my aunt messed up the grilled zucchini because she only salted the zucchini and didnt use pepper and oil beforehand, and just dumped a bunch of oil on the grilled salted zucchini and it does Not look appetizing
3245 2018-07-17 17:26:30 1. He's still allowed his free speech.  He's not taken legal action against them (unlike, say, the UK).
2. I'm for all of the above, but in the short-term, energy independence is more important so we aren't beholden to the Saudis.  We're actually exporting oil for the first time.
3246 2018-07-17 17:26:18 Their kids want in on the grift. Their hangers-on want to stay on the grift. They want to retire into the sweet embrace of the retirement lecture/dinner circuit grift. 
It’s all a show for one chapter in their memoir titled “Courage” or like bs
3247 2018-07-17 17:26:09 Light and Darkness will never meet.
Oil and water the same
3248 2018-07-17 17:26:09 Imagine if we took the $14 trillion we spent on Iraq & Afghanistan, filling the pockets of oil companies, defense contractors & weapons dealers, making them billionaires & instead eliminated poverty, medical bills & student debt..
3249 2018-07-17 17:26:07 What about the Russian oil pipeline to Germany??? Will Putin beat us there, too?

3252 2018-07-17 17:25:49 But why do i get a feeling that the pic you have shown is of desalination plant when the news is about oil.
3253 2018-07-17 17:25:21 Confused where demanding (and getting) increased defense spending by NATO countries, promising increasing of our own, and publicly ripping Germany and France for giving Russia too much money for oil is advancing Russian priorities, but ok.
3254 2018-07-17 17:24:56 Have middle East countries done anything to curb world demand for oil? No. Instead they do everything to promote it and now they are reaping what they sow. God is Great!!
3255 2018-07-17 17:24:54 @elonmusk for a man who claims to care about climate change, I’m just wondering why you donated money to a party that wants to take the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement and continue to invest in coal and oil. Seems like maybe you really only care about being a billionaire...
3256 2018-07-17 17:24:54 I just reread my tweet, and I saw how it could be interpreted as vague but serious. Bad joke on my part. My apologies.

3259 2018-07-17 17:24:45 Complain but no action. Why didn't Congress begin impeachment hearings on FBI long time ago? Both Dems and GOP in chaos bumping into each other. So is Fox.
3260 2018-07-17 17:24:40 If this law is allowed to stand we will not be allowed to know if our Politicians have accepted $ from the big Pharmaceutical Co, the big Oil Co., Russia! It can NOT be allowed to stand! PERIOD!
3261 2018-07-17 17:24:31 I recall when thousands of people from Seattle went out in their kayaks to protest a drilling rig moving out to do exploration in Alaska. Where did their kayaks’ plastic come from? What of gas for the thousands of SUVs and trucks used to transport their kayaks? Hmm... oil rigs?
3262 2018-07-17 17:24:21 @curaleaffl while I absolutely love your hybrid distillate, y'all need to stop cutting the 80% distillate with so much MCT. 2 cartridges at 48$ each and after going through them I barely feel anything and its gone in less than a day. Feels like oil pulls into the mouth :|
3263 2018-07-17 17:24:21 I remember when working in the oil patch being told when crapping in the woods, bring bear mase and a pipewrench. If the mase doesn't work, hit him with the wrench!
3264 2018-07-17 17:24:18 you enjoy my darling...I can feel a ratatouille coming on.
3265 2018-07-17 17:24:07 Make sure you’re using translucent powder to set your makeup. When oil appears take a flat (not wrinkled) tissue and just blot the oil away
3266 2018-07-17 17:24:06 Coconut oil is just the best thing ever eh its amazin for everythin!!! smotherinnnn ma whole body in it  smooth as a babys bum
3267 2018-07-17 17:23:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
3268 2018-07-17 17:23:57 Wrong. The EU regulation on the production of olive oil, for example, applies automatically to the UK by virtue of the ECA but as the UK does not manufacture olive oil it isn't applied. And where are you getting that figure of 52741 EU laws that apply? Justify please.
3269 2018-07-17 17:23:54 Omg I took a bath with @SheaMoisture’s avacado oil and I’ve never felt so soft in my life. I feel like a damn ass baby

3273 2018-07-17 17:23:33 So the massive institutional corruption that is rife throughout Africa has absolutely nothing to do with its nations poverty? 

As for the claim that the dollar etc are not based on natural resources id like to point out that all of those currencies are backed by crude oil.
3274 2018-07-17 17:23:30 Oil Ocean looks weird with a blue background instead of the usual orange one.
3275 2018-07-17 17:23:29 We need harsher & quicker punishment for all those who are involved in the minor rape case.why can’t the judicial system burn their midnight oil & punish them immediately & in PUBLIC, to ensure no such unspeakable crime repeats
3276 2018-07-17 17:23:23 My battery dies every time after getting an oil change! What’s going on?

3278 2018-07-17 17:23:03 India should stand with Iran on the oil buying issue .
3279 2018-07-17 17:22:48 We cutting grass? We checking bumps in the night? We changing oil? We talking the trash out? We carrying luggage? We checking teenage kids? We doing repairs? 

Okay then Let's go.
3280 2018-07-17 17:22:29 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
3281 2018-07-17 17:22:29 After massive gas/oil deals tween China/Russia & for Trump to think he can pit Russia against China & Iran is absurd. Putin spends time reviewing,studying while Trump plays golf & than tries to "wing it".Tis idiot hasn't a clue.

3311 2018-07-17 17:18:54 That’s approximately the scheme in Norway and oil companies seem to be doing just fine there.
3312 2018-07-17 17:18:37 The you're so daft, this country is the envy of the world and has an extremely high standard of living. Also, cowboy hats pre-date the oil industry...an industry that is the most corrupt & big business....Koch brothers etc. With this one tweet you have lost all credibility.

3315 2018-07-17 17:18:30 Important thing to do, this Nov. is to vote OUT(regardless of party) any official that's been in DC for more than 4 terms.

3346 2018-07-17 17:14:00 This so sad. In his rush to be friends with big oil, trump is causing irreparable damage to the environment and 1000’s of historical sites.
3347 2018-07-17 17:14:00 Seriously? Wakeup, the only thing trump is ensuring is to make enough noise that keeps his base happy. He doesn't have the knowledge or background to help our country, only himself. He is a great snake oil salesman.

Whats it all about?
3351 2018-07-17 17:13:16 Scandinavian capitalism includes a universalist welfare system and collective bargaining. Again, Nazi Germany wasn't a socialist economy. Venezuela socialism failed when Chavez ceased all manufacturing to focus strictly on oil production. The USSR was Lenninist communism.

3358 2018-07-17 17:12:27 We use CBD oil and give Sherwood Joint Support tablets. Coop does seem to get anxious on the CBD (spooked more easily) so we may try another brand or just not do it every day. Trilly is fine on it. More active is very good! Keeps those joints working!
3359 2018-07-17 17:12:13 I have a breakout from eating pasta with too much oil and I think I’d rather have that than a breakout from wearing too much makeup

3361 2018-07-17 17:11:56 they infiltrated the right wing in US because lot of them are in the oil business and are trying to break apart the eu, nato and un so that nobody will stop international law breaches
3362 2018-07-17 17:11:51 Higher oil prices is in the best interest of Russia. Without high crude oil prices they would be very weak. That's one issue draining my bank account among many.

3364 2018-07-17 17:11:41 Meanwhile the Pence family is forcing the US gov to clean up his oil co poison so far to the tune of 20 mil and Pence brother gets to keep his own mils. We paid all Pence creditors via his bankruptcy and now we taxp pay for the clean up and many mil more to clean up their mess.
3365 2018-07-17 17:11:38 Beard oil should be applied 1-3 times daily. How much thy uses is up to thine beard. Do not question thy beard. Just follow it. My beard requests a dropper full.

3375 2018-07-17 17:10:46 I made the best instant mashed potatoes ever with coconut oil and vanilla soymilk but my mom tried it and was like, "Ew!! This isn't good!!" FINE MORE FOR ME
3376 2018-07-17 17:10:46 if you follow it they have been running propaganda campaigns across europe and the states against anything that competes with oil, which is what happened with fracking and also seems to be happening with renewables the rich in the oil sector are trying to stop the move.

US  bought lots of oil from Saudi Arabia eventhough Saudi's private citizens are systematically trying to undermine us

3391 2018-07-17 17:09:06 What's the point of booking an appointment with @Honda weeks in advance to wait 2+ hours for an oil change? Absolutely ridiculous.
3392 2018-07-17 17:09:05 .@LouisianaGov on today's announcement of projects funded by BP oil spill settlement dollars: "Here we are finally at a point where we can discuss specific projects that will, in fact, be funded." #lalege #lagov

3396 2018-07-17 17:08:37 Really? Did anyone say they had infrastructure problems? No, they sell enough oil and gas to pay for hundreds of cups.

The issues everyone had were about a brutal authoritarian regime that hates gays, blacks and political dissidents.

That has certainly not been fixed.

According to Dr. Von, watermelon is a cooling food. "It's true that it's in season, but it also cools heat," she said. If you're sick of plain watermelon, try adding mint, rosemary, and/or olive oil.
3403 2018-07-17 17:08:01 If Trump and Putin have a shared objective, what is it? Both are all about the money and the control. What could they possibly want to control? Isn't this ultimately about oil?

3407 2018-07-17 17:07:28 Unfortunate how things fell together, briefly, for their bs?

Saudi over-production of oil, Iran's return of hostages, decline in inflation, fall of Berlin Wall...things GOP got credit for, but totally unrelated to their policy agenda.

All coming on the heels of a bad decade.

3409 2018-07-17 17:07:22 What are the three main types of paints that are used to stripe asphalt parking lots? Latex paints, oil based paints and thermoplastic paints. Out of these three, thermoplastic paints offer the highest-quality and longest-lasting results.

3411 2018-07-17 17:07:16 The trick with those peas is to drain them first, then put them in a small bowl or ramekin with a little olive oil and kosher salt. Microwave for 20 seconds. Not bad at all actually, when you’ve been working all day and need a quick side.

3441 2018-07-17 17:04:14 That may not happen for another 30 years though.
3442 2018-07-17 17:04:13 Honestly that olive oil tweet was somehow a hit maybe I should start giving out unsolicited advice regularly
3443 2018-07-17 17:04:13 As crazy as it sounds put more oil in it to get it out. I usually use olive oil spray or oil lol and conditioner.
3444 2018-07-17 17:04:10 Dictatorships can run free market economies, such as the Arab oil  states. Communist China is 'successful' in that it the world's 2nd largest economy. Democracies have socialized segments controlled by the government (US Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard)

3446 2018-07-17 17:03:56 .@katecbauer: US can focus on locking up #Iran oil revenue as it pursues reduction in oil exports. Authority rests on 2 separate pre-JCPOA provisions designed to prevent price spikes.
3447 2018-07-17 17:03:43 There is a freeze in place for the oil sands.
3448 2018-07-17 17:03:37 If independence is so cherished why do most nations clamber to be in a trading block? Personally I'd rather be a rule maker than taker, that is real sovereignty rather than pipe dreams sold by snake oil salesmen such as Rees-Mogg, Redwood and Johnson

3450 2018-07-17 17:03:17 Until tech gets to where it needs to be, we are dependent on oil. That won’t change. Where we buy from can.

3454 2018-07-17 17:03:06 It has to do with the favt that our country hasnt changed course since the end of ww2.

We bomb everyone who doesnt take our dollar for their oil. Period. Nothing has changed under president Trump, except the pretty face of the empire was replaced  by a text book villian
3455 2018-07-17 17:03:04 Is there really hunreds of billions of dollars in assets?  Are these joint ventures of oil companies where worth is based on revenue?  Curious how this is calculated.
3456 2018-07-17 17:02:56 WTI oil tries to steady after yesterday's steep decline which was touched off by rising supply fears now at $68.13/barrel, near unchanged.
3457 2018-07-17 17:02:43 We need more Republicans to beat the 60 super majority. Obama could’ve fix Obamacare but he was too proud of it. No Democrat will fix it. No Democrat can lower gas prices—hell they hate oil so they would force us to be more dependent on OPEC. At least w/Trump we’re less dependent
3458 2018-07-17 17:02:43 @realDonaldTrump This will also help protesters inside Iran, we are strong on our positions until November. The weakness of the Treasury Secretary is unacceptable and we will never accept such a thing. November is the end of Iranian oil
3459 2018-07-17 17:02:39 Too much acid/liquid. Blend it into a whole egg, potentially add more oil
3460 2018-07-17 17:02:23 てか絵文字追加したらまたあのbot増えるじゃん…クジャクbotとかわい死ぬぞ
3461 2018-07-17 17:02:18 @realDonaldTrump It's very important for us to boycott 100% of oil, even more important than canceling the deal. Iran's oil should be completely cut off by November, it should not allow Iran to export a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia could easily take over Iran's oil.
3462 2018-07-17 17:02:16 嫁かっ！？
3463 2018-07-17 17:02:16 My car is finally done.

I took it in to check out a broken shield and change the oil.

They kept it to take care of a couple of recalls.

One was for door latches that would malfunction and not, well, latch.

My door latched, so I didn't bring it sooner. 1/2
3464 2018-07-17 17:02:13 One day you can get me a can of air filter oil when you’re ballin 
3465 2018-07-17 17:02:06 Do you drive a car?  Ever take a vacation?  Heat your home?  Explain how you would get food on your damn table by shutting down global oil, with today’s technology?  We can’t just hard stop. We’re committed. We have a long ways to go before we get there. And we need to get there.
3466 2018-07-17 17:01:59 You would think everyone could follow those steps but apparently many cannot. Too many ppl end up in ER for self afflicted GSW or hurting others because they are not observant.

3468 2018-07-17 17:01:49 @realDonaldTrump It is really a disgrace if the US government allows anyone to buy oil from Iran, it's a disaster. In three months, Iran's oil can easily be cut off, if the US government really has the ability to do so.

3470 2018-07-17 17:01:37 Brent ICE and WTI slowly sliding down for September oil futures. Oil supplies continue to be at capacity even during travel season.

3475 2018-07-17 17:01:15 Their oil has also made their country so expensive.
3476 2018-07-17 17:01:09 Because B.C like to hold the entire country hostage and are for foreign oil, like Saudi Arabia. 

The Kinder Morgan expansion needs to get built, our oil is being undercut by the West Texas Crude pricing and we're paying the prices at the pump. 

Wake up B.C!

3481 2018-07-17 17:00:45 The Fed is good at pursuading markets, but the fundamentals of #CrudeOil are bigger than the US ponzi. Talk can suppress short term prices, but oil is going to spike and with that spike the US will enter a recession. #OOTT

3494 2018-07-17 16:59:50 Watching Teen Titans GO! While waiting for my cars oil change and they just made a freaking "My Cousin Vinny" reference. Whyyyy?
3495 2018-07-17 16:59:46 I'm always skeptical that the shooter was actually trying to clean the gun in these incidents.
3496 2018-07-17 16:59:32 Have u tried a super wide toothed comb and combing when wet? Idk if it would help w tangling but you should try a leave in conditioner or hair oil too
3497 2018-07-17 16:59:14 wow olive oil is my life saver !!! Y’all shleeepin’ on it ladies 
3498 2018-07-17 16:59:12 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sad part is that the illegitimate Regime that invaded Persia in 1978 (2nd invasion by Islamic Militia (land of 1st Christ believers,Armenians) controls their Oil & Treasury Reserves,US DOLLAR V RIALS Tripled,unfortunately Regime gained more power over IR people
3499 2018-07-17 16:59:08 Very pleased to announce that on Sat. 9/1/18 Danville and Mooresville will participate in the first high school soccer games to be played at Lucas Oil Stadium.  Girls will play at 11 am and boys at 1:30 pm. Ticket information will be provided in the near future. #WarriorPride
3500 2018-07-17 16:59:01 No that becuase of the "oil companies" who wanted Iraqs oil. But yes they did get help from the media and intelligence agencies.
3501 2018-07-17 16:58:57 Ya, she turned & no one is impressed by that but if U wanna lay criticism it should be on Williams, Collyer, etc. They picked her. The “anti oil” NDP was working WITH the industry following THEIR recommendations as to what our O&G sector needed to be prosperous. #HindightIs2020
3502 2018-07-17 16:58:46 Finally getting an oil change  it’s been a minute...

3504 2018-07-17 16:58:35 girl take some castor oil, my mom says he’ll be out within a few days or even hours.
3505 2018-07-17 16:58:27 As far as your fave hurting I usually take turns swooshing the oil and massaging my cheeks and jaw to help with the tension
3506 2018-07-17 16:58:26 Finally, a parade I wouldn't mind attending.

@OkeyEnelamah @GarShehu @ProfOsinbajo @AsoRock The need to get down to work is now! Stop roadshow! Post oil world is imminently starting by 2019. Where's Nigeria's place in post oil world? Doing roadshow! Pathetic! Pathetic!!
3508 2018-07-17 16:58:01 Cystic acne? I had that in high school and I have to stop eating so much dairy, also stopped using products with salicylic acid in it, and I moisture with tea tree oil! I stopped getting them and my scars faded. But everyone is different
3509 2018-07-17 16:57:49 Honda keeps emailing me that my car is due for an oil change.......it’s not tho, since I abandoned it in WA 2 months ago lololollll
3510 2018-07-17 16:57:43 This would be oil temp and battery voltage, as long as they are nothing extreme and everything is working you should be fine.
3511 2018-07-17 16:57:37 Oh no! Try varying amounts of coconut oil  sometimes I have to do a little bit less since it becomes fully liquid & as for dryness you can try adding lavender or rose oil to help soothe that
3512 2018-07-17 16:57:35 White pepper and extra virgin olive oil - not forgetting seasalt - life is just a lot duller without them
3513 2018-07-17 16:57:31 United oil cartels in action. As Saudi, Oman, China & other countries divest from fossil fuel the Russia, US, Syria & N. Korea oligarchs come in for the scraps. Why r we surprised? Naivety/ Stupidity? What?

3517 2018-07-17 16:57:08 Why so naive reply, @gauravcsawant is clueless to speciality of RR, born n bred from various segments , trained for more than armed conflict ,you well understand.Oil..
3518 2018-07-17 16:57:07 Yet we tolerate your hypocritical allegiance to tribal monarchy and Patriarchy because we enjoy your critical thinking skills on development economics, but let's not conflate despotism with magnanimity. Gadaffi using the proceeds of oil to buy weapons is why NATO attacked.
3519 2018-07-17 16:56:58 The oil in my chicken stew can last Nigeria for another 10 years. Damn 
3520 2018-07-17 16:56:47 On Sunday evening we assisted 3 adults and  5 children following a house fire on the 600 block of Mitchell Avenue Oil City, PA., Vena ngo County.

3522 2018-07-17 16:56:31 Smelling like Coconut Oil and Ole’ Bay. Just black. 
3523 2018-07-17 16:56:18 So for the last year it was there, the gas station owner's promotional strategy was "get an oil change and we'll buy you Whataburger doublecheeseburger." Big sign advertising this in his waiting room window.
3524 2018-07-17 16:56:13 get a sulfate free shampoo and use about twice a week if that's possible for u, if u have very oily hair then you may need to wash it more often, but not every day. don't blow dry without a diffuser. Use a hair mask every so often and try a leave in conditioner or hair oil.
3525 2018-07-17 16:56:11 as someone who’s nervous habit is rubbing my eyes (resulting in the skin below my eyes to become raw) i use an olive oil skin balm beneath my eyes to protect my skin

3527 2018-07-17 16:56:00 Today I learned that the smell of rain after dry weather has a name: petrichor. One contributor to the smell is the release of a compound called geosmin by bacteria in the soil. Another is an oil released by plants in dry periods. #everydaysaschoolday

3538 2018-07-17 16:54:49 What is a safer transport method?  Tanker, train, or pipeline?  With our regulatory and inspection requirements?  Pipelines. We don’t have any controls on the tankers that ship to our shores. Trains crash in cities. Responsible oil production is here at home.
3539 2018-07-17 16:54:47 use Trader Joe’s hair mask! With Shea butter and coconut oil :)

3547 2018-07-17 16:54:06 Hausa, Fulani & Yoruba feel they can't survive without oil. The Igbos are good to go in any circumstance. We just wants #freedom from This people

3550 2018-07-17 16:53:33 I started small the first three things I did are:
1. Change all my oil to these three, olive, coconut or avocado
2. Reduce processed carbs (crackers, chips etc) 
3. Reduce my crazy french fry habit 
It took some time to get those down but once I did the rest was so easy
3551 2018-07-17 16:53:24 Sams there’s barely any actual Argan oil in these products don’t be fooled. Secondly, it’s most probably refined and processed, because unrefined Argan oil is VERYYY strong in smell, very nutty, very earthy. Not something you’d put in your hair and walk outside with 
3552 2018-07-17 16:53:18 purchasing “bitch be gone” oil today
3553 2018-07-17 16:53:12 How much oil y'all got?

3556 2018-07-17 16:53:00 #DidYouKnow #Coconut oil - It's naturally #antibacterial and #antifungal, coconut oil for skin is an excellent moisturizer, it can penetrate hair better than other oils, PLUS it smells like coconut cookies 
3557 2018-07-17 16:52:58 Or you could use cooking oil just a little bit before doing the veggies
3558 2018-07-17 16:52:55 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil, then plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs!
3559 2018-07-17 16:52:42 Unrefined coconut oil does wonders for the scalp ! No perms, no grease . 
3560 2018-07-17 16:52:41 in sumflower oil it does go crispy but doesnt stay crispy for longer than a few hours as for the dough 
the ordinary bread dough you can buy at spar works amazingly well
3561 2018-07-17 16:52:22 I will always choose peace over war. The US has spent all of our treasure and pissed it away on wars that should have never happened. We have been lied to and millions have died for greed. Cheney and his cronies are waiting to get their oil in Syria. Genie Energy.....Google it.
3562 2018-07-17 16:52:16 It's like an addiction. Battered spouse syndrome.
3563 2018-07-17 16:52:14 Yeah you  literally a beacon of innocent and justice. You killed millions of innocent people over oil and you vilify Russia who never hurt a single american while you defend the world's worst human rights violators Israel . You are the definition of hypocrisy

3567 2018-07-17 16:51:30 toppings I have down already. When would I make this? What dough recipe do I use? Is my olive oil delicious enough?
3568 2018-07-17 16:51:26 Russia is not a US competitor. It's GDP relies on oil and gas which amounts to 1.5 trillion annually. That's pittance compared to the 38 trillion combined GDP of UK and the EU territories. Russia is just a gas station. Renewable energy threatens its economy. That's what happened!
3569 2018-07-17 16:51:24 Why is $60 for an oil change expensive but $60 for a concert ticket is a steal
3570 2018-07-17 16:51:23 Coconut oil works well too. You must have some of that lying around the restaurant.

3574 2018-07-17 16:51:13 @JimCarrey never even considered art but became super inspired after stumbling across your work. Thinking about giving it a go. What type of paint do you use for your everyday pieces you post? Oil? Acrylic? Water? Thanks man. Cheers

3591 2018-07-17 16:49:36 This would also mean one or all of the following:
1) Opec would bow down to US
2) US would produce crazy amount of oil
3) Prolonged peace in Mid-East
4) EVs take centerstage

3595 2018-07-17 16:49:08 Exactly the Last president gave all oil contracts to Brazil and China. Now we have an American President who gives American people the jobs and they complain! They have lost their minds. The Dems were getting ready to put us in FEMA camps that Obama built 600  in USA!

3605 2018-07-17 16:48:20 How are you spelling tankers?
3606 2018-07-17 16:48:20 Oil Prices fell as worries over supply disruptions eased and the focus moved to increasing domestic production and potential damage to global growth from the U.S.-China trade dispute.
3607 2018-07-17 16:48:20 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3613 2018-07-17 16:48:01 It turns out you don't have to eat to survive. You just have to slather yourself in Coconut Oil and Activated Charcoal. That's the fountain of youth. #beautytips #survivaltips
3614 2018-07-17 16:48:00 More studio time today and I have nervously continued with the oil of a beach near Exmouth. It’s not as ‘free’ as I would like but (a) I’m not particularly good at ‘free', and (b) it takes a while to get back to feeling confident

No tech, no exports.

RU needs to sell oil.

The only way RU does better is by dragging everyone else down.

Enter Trump.
Destroying trade.
Attacking allies.
High gas prices.
Legitimizes dictators. 
White nationalist agenda.

3629 2018-07-17 16:46:56 I've actually been doing keto for a while.  I'm just cutting back the fat.  Less avocados, cheese and coconut oil, but I guess it's still keto though.
3630 2018-07-17 16:46:53 Long set up in oil & gas headed into earnings.. $OXY looks ready to b/o while $FLT is retesting new support after breaking above trend channel! Nice 3.78% div on $OXY
3631 2018-07-17 16:46:50 Now we're cooking with peanut oil, boys!
3632 2018-07-17 16:46:36 Phellis v. Pacific Western Oil Co.. (1898) Undocumented immigrants can sacrifice animals.
3633 2018-07-17 16:46:32 Yay! Lets see here, I forgot exactly what I ordered. Ah, yes, this is copper, it has oil on it to prevent oxidization but it turned a little green anyway
3634 2018-07-17 16:46:21 "use rosemary oil for thicker hair" that's the last fucking thing i want
3635 2018-07-17 16:46:18 Anything else aside birthday celebrations for dead people are a bit odd.
3636 2018-07-17 16:46:15 $UWT gimme oil $68.30s
3637 2018-07-17 16:46:11 I could not. Absolutely not. 
I could be wrong but I think it's two different types of "heat" lol
Here it's like...humid and sticky...and HOT. Like, God just dropped us in hot oil...lmao you BOIL here.
3638 2018-07-17 16:45:58 Hey guys!!! I know! Why don’t we build a pipeline? You know... get oil off the rails?!?
3639 2018-07-17 16:45:56 Many of the USA's shale oil/gas projects were curbed after the 2014 sharp oil prices downfall and if oil prices would explode even further with the artificial deficit, they would come back being ever worse than ever.
So the summit is a mixed bag on this issue: both good and bad.
3640 2018-07-17 16:45:53 coconut oil mixed with castor oil and olive oil can also help with eyelash growth !
3641 2018-07-17 16:45:43 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
3642 2018-07-17 16:45:40 Need my oil change before  we hit the road
3643 2018-07-17 16:45:36 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828

3645 2018-07-17 16:45:24 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
3646 2018-07-17 16:45:21 Exactly! Our intelligence agencies can't be trusted 
They are still working for Obama, & Hillary against our
interests. They are liars, weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq was a big lie. They are working for weapons 
& oil profiteers, not for The American People!
3647 2018-07-17 16:45:19 goodnight gotta go inhale that rosemary oil to calm myself cause life's a wreck right now
3648 2018-07-17 16:45:05 @LBC this caller is a joke, she calls at least once a day spouting Remain soundbites.. She just keeps repeating James O’Brien’s Pro EU soundbites... snake oil this... Nissan that blah blah blah @IainDale
3649 2018-07-17 16:45:04 Ok sure eat it with the searing cheese on top I love it when the inside of my mouth blisters up also I love oil running down my arms and having the end of the slice just flop around all flaccid and depressing

3651 2018-07-17 16:44:59 Iain, could you please explain to me what is meant by a snake oil salesman?
3652 2018-07-17 16:44:56 Oh you're right. Treating the world's other foremost superpower with a degree of civility is not a good idea. Trump should've just gone up to him, called him a f*ckin asshole and left, right? Talking about oil, Ukraine, Iran deal, coordination in Syria was pointless, right?
3653 2018-07-17 16:44:53 That is not what you did % it is not your intention. Pay for play. Putin got you potus now you want to get Rofsneft oil flowing and banks reopened to the oligarchs and Putin. This action will help inflate yours & I am sure some in Congress portfolios. Its only about you & our 1%
3654 2018-07-17 16:44:48 It was left to your choice minx....you chose to keep your beautiful ass on display and available.....pours warm rose oil over your exposed skin
3655 2018-07-17 16:44:28 fins mabye. his dead homies are sushi. his arch enemy is an oil company. Wack!
3656 2018-07-17 16:44:12 A much needed paradigm shift, parallel to some others also occurring in the oil giant, slowly but steadily so far.
3657 2018-07-17 16:43:55 "The nastiest and craziest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3658 2018-07-17 16:43:48 Putin does not like oil prices going much higher as it'd make processing&goods too costly, so he has coordinated the kingdom of Saudi Arabia & other OPEC members to loosen limits on oil production. However, this'd also save the USA from too much predatory shale oil/gas harvest.
3659 2018-07-17 16:43:41 Its right about one thing though. Big decisions are made at the top level (renewable energy investment fell for the first time in years last year as money went to oil and gas, but not coal). But we can all do our part (hence solar panels on the roof for me)
3660 2018-07-17 16:43:35 People are killed by "unloaded" guns because the owners always forget or don't know about the one bullet left in the chamber . 
If you own a gun you need to educate yourself about how to completely unload it , clean it and store it .
3661 2018-07-17 16:43:26 It's not absurd. Seeing they were inspired by the Standard Oil cartoon is helpful, but note that the Standard Oil cartoon didn't include an actual person. The creator of the Facebook cartoon chose to use the images of Zuckerberg & Sandburg - was unconscious antisemitism at work?
3662 2018-07-17 16:43:24 FUNNY KARMA IT WAS THAT HOT OIL YOU TIPPED ON ME
3663 2018-07-17 16:43:23 I got new tires, oil change and had my vehicle inspected, thanks though 
3664 2018-07-17 16:43:19 It would have been ok, I suppose, if Trump had given Russia our oil
3665 2018-07-17 16:43:03 The Left & the Media think pressuring NATO to increase defense spending or calling members out for paying billions to Russia for oil & gas, as being a bad thing. That Trump is pushing our Allies away.  

To me it's like a parent telling a child to put a seat belt on...
3666 2018-07-17 16:42:56 @CHAZDEAN watched you on periscope yesterday loved it.  Is it true will Faith be on qvc on TSV day??! I love her.  Every since I saw her b4 and after being using TT oil, remoist and CC ever since.
3667 2018-07-17 16:42:51 But don't objectify her or something....
3668 2018-07-17 16:42:51 If I understand those nursing jobs with oil companies, job security is super high, if the husband relocates to Warri, he can get a teaching job with the snap of a finger. The wife can also offer to pay the man 100k monthly salary from her salary. Unless the man is a devil.
3669 2018-07-17 16:42:26 Should I: be outraged by the current state of our political climate, hate my body, love my body, retreat to the woods, or buy your essential oil starter kit
3670 2018-07-17 16:42:24 The Way Ladies Love Car These Days U Will Think They Were Fed With Engine Oil.
3671 2018-07-17 16:42:18 bentar, kulitmu type gimana? kalo kering sama make up terus terusan disarankan pake cleansing oil. tp kalo emang tetep pake cleansing oil, pake cleanser / milk cleanser juga bisaa
3672 2018-07-17 16:41:58 pernah pakai classic white, oil control & pimple fighting. semua berkesan

3674 2018-07-17 16:41:53 Pencils seems nuts! @Tate won't let you use charcoal, pastels, permanent markers and watercolour or oil paint
3675 2018-07-17 16:41:50 Better yet, get a tripod.
3676 2018-07-17 16:41:47 I think parrafin is not taxed. In percentage the rise is higher when oil gets more expensive
3677 2018-07-17 16:41:41 Ha ha ha.  In her own afternoon.  It's hot hot hot out there. I've more courgettes and tomatoes than you can shake a stick at.  Bring on the oiley black stuff, sticky sticks.  Did I really say that?
3678 2018-07-17 16:41:25 Did we forget about Putin russian oil company wanting to make a deal with Rex Tillerson, CEO at Exxon/Mobil and Trump SOS, worth $500 billion that President Obama sanctions stopped? A business man cares less about the turmoil for personal profit.
3679 2018-07-17 16:41:19 Olive oil is at least as healthy as coconut oil. Vegetarian or vegan? Butter is a good source of healthy animal nutrients. 

If it is about the environment you do not need to go to zero, the first 90% has the best return on investment.
3680 2018-07-17 16:41:18 Good morning Facebook family got deterred cuz I was getting new tires put on the bus but I am at Allegiant oil out on Route 61 you know my typical location for Tuesday's so if you guys are free and hungry and in the mood and then the area come on down and stop and get a sandwich
3681 2018-07-17 16:41:18 He is supposed to think like a president not a snakes oil salesman
3682 2018-07-17 16:41:13 It's the same when we call City fans "Oil Money". Do you think their fans are losing any sleep when they get called that and their teams playing beautiful football? Short answer: No.
3683 2018-07-17 16:41:06 6 weeks is up and all I’m thinking about is a nice, hot, oil bath.
3684 2018-07-17 16:41:02 Not to me. ::cries::
3685 2018-07-17 16:40:59 Be a wise virgin! Fill your lamp with oil while you still can.
3686 2018-07-17 16:40:36 When you think that repealing Net Neutrality poses a more serious threat to your physical well-being than MS-13, you're off the rails.
3687 2018-07-17 16:40:34 Naluto masyado yung Gata lol. Medyo madali kasi masunog yun. Pero looks good kasi nagmamantika and i hope yung oil ng meat sya hahaha
3688 2018-07-17 16:40:30 I heard about it while in secondary school. Unfortunately, the likes of Okitipupa oil palm plc is no more. Okomu and Presco oil are struggling to survive
3689 2018-07-17 16:40:29 oil is only good for lubrication in high frequent machines and cars,

3692 2018-07-17 16:40:10 Stating the obvious. Obama, Mandela  stand for similar values. You stand for zuma. Oil and water.
3693 2018-07-17 16:39:59 You gotta run when you throw the chips in oil
3694 2018-07-17 16:39:57 Russia is so supportive of Syria because Syria gives Russia a clear route to the Mediterranean for their pipeline. They're looking for a Mediterranean port for their gas and oil. If they're supporting Syria, they're supporting Iran. There's no doubt about that.
3695 2018-07-17 16:39:57 She asserts, "has not grown in size for a decade" - no link to reputable source to back it up. And, if that were true, why is it that its horrific crimes are only now being talked about? Were they covered up for years??
3696 2018-07-17 16:39:45 At one time (long ago), Forbes was as unimpeachable as Craig is today. I'm skeptical of the 49% for 500M numbers, but B's a hedge fund guy so swinging for the fence is his thing. Maybe he can land an oil sheikh or new Chinese billionaire who wants to be a sports mogul.
3697 2018-07-17 16:39:39 This scumbag is surely in love with oil and gas producers, undoubtedly , I Iran is tacitly included

3700 2018-07-17 16:39:10 am i gonna become one ofthose ppl who r obsessed w tea tree oil
3701 2018-07-17 16:39:07 I love #Gamers!  I'm getting my oil changed and some service guy came to find me to high five me for my warlock decal that's on my trunk. Turns out he has a pretty awesome ghost tattoo on his arm.
3702 2018-07-17 16:39:06 Too shiny??? But you use coconut oil as an alternative??? That’s the crack speaking. ADDICT COME ON OUT!!! LOOOOL
3703 2018-07-17 16:39:04 I  Canadian Oil
3704 2018-07-17 16:39:02 But maybe oil is also poison, A big problem for the world, Maybe the same as smooking a sigaret, How many friend passed away because of smoking sigarets.
3705 2018-07-17 16:38:53 Kinda ironic after a 12.6mmbbl draw and chaos ensuing in various oil producing countries causing supply disruptions, U.S. pipeline capacity booked and the Syncrude outage that a new wave of extreme bearishness presides over the markets.  Don't think it will last very long, though
3706 2018-07-17 16:38:46 kim just  got his hard water &oil during his summit had wondered how he could do this Trump gave him his out
3707 2018-07-17 16:38:42 Anlaking efficascent oil naman n’yan.
3708 2018-07-17 16:38:28 So Europe buying oil and gas behind our backs from Russia is not strengthening him? Not interfering with our sanctions we placed on them? And guess with over 20 trillion dollars in debt we have money to burn on bad trade deals right? Your a joke Corker and a embarrassment to #TN
3709 2018-07-17 16:37:54 Having Alex as my friend is honestly the best because I get to skip everyone when it comes to my oil changes 
3710 2018-07-17 16:37:38 We send your crew all our love for rescuing this little guy. It's good to keep him contained and safe until he is all healed up. TBG can try to place some lavender oil drops on the mats and towels to induce calm. And get him some goat's milk perhaps. Can help with recovery!
3711 2018-07-17 16:37:36 Smash chocolate and oil is the only reason Norway is till allowed to exist
3712 2018-07-17 16:37:27 Bc I need to go get a oil change like yesterday
3713 2018-07-17 16:37:08 Impeach the idiot before he destroys America China is getting oil from Iran another loss to America
3714 2018-07-17 16:37:02 Foreign oil producers cannot be blamed
3715 2018-07-17 16:36:53 Do you think the reference to Standard Oil was a lie?
3716 2018-07-17 16:36:48 I really been sleeping on black seed oil
3717 2018-07-17 16:36:42 I swear we're a bunch of pointless oil merchants
3718 2018-07-17 16:36:40 Relative to GDP, $AAPL earnings are now so big that it is entering a danger zone that has been occupied by only a few other corporate colossi, including the East India Company and... Standard Oil. If history is any guide, Apple will not get bigger...(@TheEconomist)

3722 2018-07-17 16:36:16 The world will become a dust bowl.  Water is the next oil.  If we can’t get rain, we will perish.
3723 2018-07-17 16:36:11 Wait! Also The Loggins: goats cheese, sundried tomatoes, olives, pine nuts, basil, roasted peppers, red onion. Olive oil and balsamic, contact grill.
3724 2018-07-17 16:35:53 Had them out too for whole new system, now using local firm and about £2000 less and they are taking all the old oil stuff away too. Knew B.Gas would be the dearest. Third quote was £2000 less too.

Funny.
3730 2018-07-17 16:35:06 Where the trees grow bigger in its fertile soil, sometimes I often wonder if there’s any oil
3731 2018-07-17 16:34:52 I also wear lavender oil on my body (idk if you’re supposed to do that but I do) bc bugs don’t like the smell of lavender either and it’s a much more subtle and nicer smell than the tea tree oil smell

3736 2018-07-17 16:34:23 All I have to say is don’t put oil in ya bob, just let the natural oils in your hair and hands give it life 
3737 2018-07-17 16:34:21 So a distabilased Libya with mass exodus of migrants to Europe , terrorism and slavery is better than Gaddafis "dictatorship" that gave citizens free education, free healthcare, free electricity etc  Gaddafi was killed for Oil stop being blind.
3738 2018-07-17 16:34:11 Add some tomatoes, a little red onion, pepper & salt........ maybe a splash of olive oil and red wine vinegar........

3742 2018-07-17 16:34:05 No, me being very bright gives me insight into many tings. You're creating a false comparison. I can show you a Facebook post from 2016, showing the huge decline in Oil prices, following the Russian incursion. Russia helped Trump because of oil prices - it's obvious.
3743 2018-07-17 16:34:05 It’s actually an oil but yeah continue swooning over me
3744 2018-07-17 16:34:01 This is exactly why firearm safety is nonnegotiable.

3746 2018-07-17 16:33:54 Considering I helped you put oil and shit in it, I think i should be the one.
3747 2018-07-17 16:33:52 If you get them around your bed then buy tea tree oil and then get a qtip, dip it in there and then dot it around your bed. It’s a really strong sent so just dipping the qtip and dabbing it around will make a difference. Bugs don’t like that smell so it’ll keep them away.

3757 2018-07-17 16:31:28 Doesn't matter what he says, it's what he does. Perhaps he is tightening the screws on Putin and sat with him yesterday and said your oil output is doomed. At the same time maybe he told NATO your abetting this thug. Pay up!
3758 2018-07-17 16:31:14 MORE FAKE NEWS. Common myth needs to be dispelled. CBD: oil, medical, non-psychoactive, good  THC: smoked, non medical, psychoactive, bad. THC is essential to treat many many medical conditions.
3759 2018-07-17 16:31:10 That was a dif labour tho. Reason Indy became an issue is decades of piss takin, eng stealin oil fields etc, I'm just sayin it would be conceivably possible for a genuinely socialist Labour gov to benefit union. While the SNP does nothing they're betraying those borrowed votes
3760 2018-07-17 16:31:05 And also he's Very Online and clearly actually reads people's tweets about him so you can actually tell him to go fuck himself lol. Not a lotta oil barons having hilarious meltdowns on Twitter
3761 2018-07-17 16:30:56 Just saw a tiny jar of “made in Malibu” body scrub for $64. 

You know some spoiled rich kid spent 10 min mixing together coconut oil & sugar & thought they deserved $64 for it.

3769 2018-07-17 16:29:42 Wow... Just found out Malaysia didn't have any palm oil as of the time Nigeria was a major exporter of the same commodity. Now Malaysia is the number 1 palm oil exporting country in the world
3770 2018-07-17 16:29:38 #ISGPP #SeminarSeries #Unemployment #JobCreation Agriculture is the next oil in Nigeria. Farming is now attractive to  young people. Opportunities exists within the agricultural space, but  with emphasis on technology.

No reason for this
We NEED refinieries built to process our own crude oil
3772 2018-07-17 16:29:33 U do recognize that the state gets 12.5% off the top of every oil well drilled & produced and when it involves state lands add an additional 12.5%-25% again off the top to state coffers?
3773 2018-07-17 16:29:26 The oil definitely

3775 2018-07-17 16:29:22 No the left fucking hates oil barons too. Elon is a special frustration because people who think of themselves as "liberal" love him and think he's a "good" billionaire because he's zAnNy or whatever, it's absurd

3783 2018-07-17 16:28:43 Russia is a nuclear power - threats of force are not a smart idea. Trumps approaching this the right way - give Putin his headlines as you erode his power - remember Trump just basically nixed a $9b oil pipeline between Russia and Germany. He praised Putin as he fucked him
3784 2018-07-17 16:28:41 “Oh? Oh you like me covered in oil?” He grinned, running a hand up his chest. “I could oil myself any time for you.” 

“But I do make a purposeful effort to put the tech away when I’m you.”
3785 2018-07-17 16:28:39 The time has come for Scotland to get serious about independence. The Sassanachs have robbed you of your oil wealth to keep the Thatcherites in power. The Tories are born nasty - give them a wide berth. Examine your conscience if one of them smiles at you !

3797 2018-07-17 16:27:00 Yeah, like that's made a difference. GOP is soaked to the skin in Russian oil/oligarchs money and deals. GOP and NRA have been compromised by Putin agents for decades. If Trump goes down he takes them with him. So, of course Ryan doesn't think Trump committed treason.

3810 2018-07-17 16:25:20 i'm talking about oil money

the world runs on fossil fuels and russia has a lot of it.

bribes and corruption are small potatoes .. order of magnitude less important

and without the context of what's being traded for in those bribes, it's all just theater.

3883 2018-07-17 16:17:18 I view this through a different lens. It introduces a distortion (subsidy) based on assumptions about health that may be false* or will linger long after they are. It's why we still artificially prop up farming & oil industries.

*80%+ of gym members never go.
3884 2018-07-17 16:17:06 The current economy is due to measures taken by the Obama Administration. With your tax scam, trade wars, and loss of Iranian oil, you will tank the stock market & economy. You will cause a recession...be looking for it!

3900 2018-07-17 16:16:08 Everyone all freaking out about #Russia #UnitedStates #TrumpPutin and I'm kind of wondering what #China has been up to? Quietly. Stealthily. Buying businesses, corporations, land, Casinos, BC old folks homes, mines, oil/gas companies...You know. Just the usual.

3906 2018-07-17 16:15:42 Kimberlee Dawn - died from poisoning from oil paints and other toxic art materials. One thing I would have changed-get out more, travel, meet more people, collect more stories.
3907 2018-07-17 16:15:39 Consider the following:
a) The international oil markets crashed with an economy built on oil revenues
b) Maduro is an egomaniac with bad policy-making
c) Maduro has a waning grip on the military, which provides a lot of the public services in Venezuela

U might have heard of various incidents of "American citizens" wink wink being arrested or disappearing. Typically spies, saboteurs, assassins. Not innocent.
3918 2018-07-17 16:14:53 My forehead area looks clear and no oil but it's quite dehydrated bc I notice it has fine lines. My cheek area, on the other hand, always have acne, often oily, enlarged pores BUT no fine lines.

3920 2018-07-17 16:14:47 I have taken measures to improve draw & combustion, unlike my neighbours unserviced damp causing oil boiler ..have you thought of wearing a badge that says "extremely pious" !?

3926 2018-07-17 16:14:17 Sure, but why shut down production way out in the fields if one of the ports is hit? They could re-route the oil to another port instead.
3927 2018-07-17 16:14:15 Russia does want the oil from Syria and I can't blame Putin for running Russia for his people but he can't blame other nations for protecting it's people also.

3934 2018-07-17 16:13:46 Lol never watched it, my take was just off-the-cuff stuff knowing the US oil import enuff :)
3935 2018-07-17 16:13:37 Duh! Sure they are!  a very soft one, with the help 
of Mueller, Rosenstein, the media, Soros, & The RiNOs 
War profiteers & oil profiteers are nervous!
Putin is a competitor, that's why the British & The US
don't stop lying about him. Assad isn't going anywhere 

3936 2018-07-17 16:13:36 The Grand Old Putin Party has been dealing in gas and oil $ while they can (why they aren't doing their job). So obvious. Technology and innovation will advance, turn the GOPP into dinosaurs, and things WILL get better b/c Mueller follows the $$$
3937 2018-07-17 16:13:35 no 
L- liquid (leave-in conditioner)

3940 2018-07-17 16:13:31 @Richard46775868 Hey are you the guy that keeps threatening my mom on social media because you keep trying to scam her out of money?? If this is not youu then buddy someone is using your photo and giving a back story of being an oil rig guy stuck out at sea needing over $7000
3941 2018-07-17 16:13:25 Why not asking dDoS against oil companies and banks as well? (They also are threats against the environment). I suggest you cool down and read RFC 8280, section 5.2.3.
3942 2018-07-17 16:13:22 #AAOG no need for ramping tweets like this will rise on Fomo or charts. This is a genuinely sound investment with a potential to be producing c750 bopd or more in the short term on the first 2 known oil producing targets.
3943 2018-07-17 16:13:18 Provision is made in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ for the healing of the mortal body. Prayer for the sick and anointing with oil are taught in the Scriptures and are privileges for the Church in this present age.

3947 2018-07-17 16:13:06 What hostages?

I'm not happy w/Obama's performance either, but someone misleading U regarding what happened & what bigger picture is. Pallets of cash were actually  funds frozen after CIA-staged incident gov't had no control over; subsequently overthrown in coup.
3948 2018-07-17 16:12:59 Speaking to someone who controls 45% of the world's nuclear weapons to improve relations soured by The Obama and McCain so Joe Biden's son can make money in Ukraine & Genie Energy can steal the oil under the golan heights is treason .

That's about the jist of it
3949 2018-07-17 16:12:55 Oil & Gas, along with coal are the main sources of energy. Wind and solar are expensive and represent very little of global energy output. Even in countries such as Germany.
3950 2018-07-17 16:12:46 It's normal to add gingelly oil as well.
3951 2018-07-17 16:12:42 oil is made from dinosaurs and plastic is made from oil therefore plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs...right?
3952 2018-07-17 16:12:36 Dermatix bisa.. Bio oil juga bisa

Iran gained access to more than $100bn in assets frozen, and was able to resume selling oil." Great!

3973 2018-07-17 16:09:55 This is also why their landing pages often look identical. Huge text. Fake countdown timers. Webinars. So many drip emails. At best, it’s ugly. At worst, it’s snake oil. Do your own research.
3974 2018-07-17 16:09:53 If I was a hedge fund manager, I'd be gobbling up the positions sold by those dumb enough to succumb to the 'fossil-free' movement. Oil and Natural Gas are here to stay and will be more heavily relied on than ever in the coming decades. #Ireland #FossilFree

3989 2018-07-17 16:08:35 The senior citizens I’m eaves dropping on at this legion hall aren’t convinced that their CBD oil is doing anything for them. They’re divided over whether it’s snake oil or if they just need to pay more to get “the good stuff”.

4030 2018-07-17 16:05:00 If you honk at me 0.025 seconds after the light turns green I'm going to put my vehicle in park, adjust my seat, check my tire pressure, change my oil, return some emails, eat a snack, read a book, brush my teeth, nap, and build a Lego set.

4032 2018-07-17 16:04:55 Oil as in oik cleanser or body oil?
4033 2018-07-17 16:04:47 Merasa bersihhh, pori2 mengecil (duet maut sama innisfree jeju super), biar ga kering langsung pake toner dan moist atau face oil sih
4034 2018-07-17 16:04:43 The oil that brings light, it pierces the darkness and illuminate everything around it. Nothing can stop it because the Anointing is the overflow of Christ's life. And once the Anointing starts to flow over you,
4035 2018-07-17 16:04:41 i hate getting my oil changed.

CAN YOU JUST CHANGE THE OIL!?!?!

4038 2018-07-17 16:04:18 Seafoam works wonders. I throw it in my engine before I change oil. Gets a lot of crud out.

4042 2018-07-17 16:04:07 I like all the talk about treason. The real treason was the #IranDeal . We gave them $100B plus and opened them up to sell oil and be prosperous in the world economy with no real concessions from them. I'd like someone to negotiate with me like that...
4043 2018-07-17 16:03:54 If oil was at $200 a barrel, Bernie Sanders would be doing backflips in Venezuela
4044 2018-07-17 16:03:54 It makes MC suspect in my book. After all, Halliburton paid Daddy $20M to go make a war for oil.  See PNAC.
4045 2018-07-17 16:03:49 Russia's economy is small for its population, and highly dependent on energy. We don't even need to bomb them. We can just flood the global oil and gas markets.
4046 2018-07-17 16:03:41 I have an air fryer. It makes stuff crunchy like a regular frier, but it takes much longer. 20 minutes for fries. I also thought they tasted weird, but my husband said that's just because I'm used to tasting the oil.
4047 2018-07-17 16:03:40 I'm only jealous of people with super dry skin when it comes to hand holding and bandaids/adhesive tape. My hands cannot keep anything adhesive on them cause as an Italian I pretty much secrete olive oil from my pores.
4048 2018-07-17 16:03:31 @TheKitchenista Hi, how did you like frying in grapeseed v canola/vegetable oil?
4049 2018-07-17 16:03:31 add a little tea tree oil to your face wash 
4050 2018-07-17 16:03:19 You store oil where it will be consumed or moved in large volumes (refineries/ports). Look at KSA: Shaybah alone can produce about as much as Libya but that volume all goes to tank farms on the coast. Cushing is unique because so many lines intersect there.
4051 2018-07-17 16:03:18 3! I’ve noticed that wearing wigs for too long have ruined my hairline. So I’m taking a break from those and using your oil
4052 2018-07-17 16:03:06 Chelsea Hess gave a great talk on interfenerational effects of crude oil. I’m a fan of designs that look at contributions of mother v father on offspring health. @galvezf1 #ICBF2018
4053 2018-07-17 16:02:44 Coconut oil is life
4054 2018-07-17 16:02:43 Venezuela only has oil. Nothing else.
4055 2018-07-17 16:02:43 And some
4056 2018-07-17 16:02:43 You are hurting your own argument. Those sanctions were and are useless. Especially when you have your own allies specifically GERMANY paying Russia Billions of dollars for gas and oil.  As for Flynn lying, you're going to find out the charge against Flynn is bogus.
4057 2018-07-17 16:02:38 Or even better oil. It's mostly found in sand countries, all of our plastic, most of the medicines, cosmetics, has some kind of petroleum compound in it, fuel, etc. Its just like a miracle spice.
Oh yeah, emperor Shaddam and Saddam, current wars for oil, coincidence ?
4058 2018-07-17 16:02:36 Do what I say not what I do is the calling card of every single Obama speech. He virtue signals, sells snake oil, drops in aren't puppies cute bs, & then when he walks off stage & he goes & forms anti American protests & hangs out w/ his billionaire friends that want cheap labor

4060 2018-07-17 16:02:29 Also, heard from Thom. He should have confirmation tomorrow morning, they just need to confirm they have a meeting room booked! ;)  Ahh Big Insurers I forgot they are like an oil tanker :)
4061 2018-07-17 16:02:27 Doesn't matter what he says, it's what he does. Perhaps he is tightening the screws on Putin and sat with him yesterday and said your oil output is doomed. At the same time maybe he told NATO your abetting this thug. Pay up!

4074 2018-07-17 16:01:31 Maybe the difference isn't the money but rather when you become wealthy. A family friend worked all of her life in fairly bad jobs. When her parents died, she discovered they had oil money -- a lot of oil money. Now she wears thrift clothes and helps other people with her money.

4080 2018-07-17 16:00:52 @AliVelshi The recent rising price of oil and gasoline at the CCM is a direct reaction to TRUMP conspiring with WALL ST. TRAITORS who control the CCM and help RUSSIA'S economy at the same time he hurt America!
4081 2018-07-17 16:00:46 Stir together 11 lbs jerky with 11 lbs goose. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Boil. Serve on a bed of pasta
4082 2018-07-17 16:00:37 Loved it!   But gene editing hype can go both ways? First, there are articles building something up (cures all your ills), then they tear it down (snake oil!). CRISPR = a useful research tool but some way off the clinic? We just don’t always know what we don’t know! 
4083 2018-07-17 16:00:34 .ya'all don't have washing machines at home? Imagine missing good things over a small oil nyana here and there

4103 2018-07-17 15:59:38 Yes, but I hope it is based on the wrong perception.  Though what he said was not wise, he is going  after the oil source of revenue for Russia.  If Russia gets Europe dependent on their oil that could be a major problem for the US & them.  Trump does "appear" to bungle at times.
4104 2018-07-17 15:59:32 Yes. Coconut Oil, as well as many other oils, are sealants. They don’t moisturize at all. Creams and Butters moisturize, Oils lock in the moisture or lack thereof.

4107 2018-07-17 15:59:22 Ressources of Cameroon belong to Cameroonian, be they in SW or in NW. As well, electricity produced in Edea'Littoral belongs to Cameroon and Cameroonians. Our country has oil in South, Extreme north, Littoral regions. For us.

4123 2018-07-17 15:57:17 Now that Ontario has gotten rid of he Cap and Trade program curious when @shell @petrocanada and @ImperialOil  will be dropping gas prices in Ontario? Seems to me that the money from cap and trade just went from the Ontario government to oil companies.
4124 2018-07-17 15:57:14 Why must oil decrease?  If it does economics would not move role to renewables. Each form of energy had direct and indirect costs to compare. Lower solar costs if subsidized is not really lower costs just someone else who is paying the price.  ^..^

4127 2018-07-17 15:56:40 Within month, 6-18 t0 7-18, copper prices have fallen from 3.30$ to 2.75 a pound. Must indicate that economy is slowing rapidly. Today, Au & Ag have been smashed significantly. Oil is below 68$. Stocks, bonds holding. Is this bottoming or premonition of much worse things to come.

I was gifted Tacha Camelia Cleansing Oil, it is amazing, not sure they as a company are cruelty free so idk if I'll buy a new bottle :( I'll have to see.
4134 2018-07-17 15:55:33 We should be including the protection of #carbonsinks, such as old growth forests, peatlands, forested wetlands in any forest-climate strategy.

4145 2018-07-17 15:54:27 Don't be an idiot! There's magic system in place, where whenever Westminster is threatened at all by Scotland, we run out of oil, but then after the Tories have won their vote and kept Scotland, oil is magically found. Don't say you didn't know that!
4146 2018-07-17 15:54:25 This man wanted 75 for an oil change n i talked him down to 20 no groupon shit.
4147 2018-07-17 15:54:19 Not quite right.  He didn't buy Alberta a pipeline, afaik it belongs to the federal government no?  We'll see if it even gets built, it could collect dust for as long as they want if they chose to punish the energy sector in favour of foreign oil imports.
4148 2018-07-17 15:54:11 You should... Russia helped get us here and now keep us here. Wait until putin puts his hand in our markets or oil or whatever else he can
4149 2018-07-17 15:54:11 The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.

Cervantes, Don Quixote
4150 2018-07-17 15:54:08 This is one of the problems we see from extended oil changes. The Vanos solenoids become clogged and you start getting lots of timing issues and idling issues as well as needing to replace expensive parts.

4155 2018-07-17 15:54:00 Sure.  “Eveyone” really helped out Hillary Clinton in 2016.  You think rust belt workers, southern voters, coal, oil gas folks, the military, law enforcement and countless other flyover country folks really care what the MSM says.  Not anymore.

4158 2018-07-17 15:53:53 So tell me who owns the oceans, lakes, rivers, or air? Or why owners of rainforest land burn it down as cattle farming /palm oil make more money than sustainable forestry. The environment has no price tag, it does not produce return on capital that's why markets don't protect it.

4170 2018-07-17 15:52:19 2018- volatile markets, soaring oil prices, and troops killed in skirmishes. Yep, it’s all already happening, much of it due to Trump’s own incompetence
4171 2018-07-17 15:51:51 jajajajaa ya las tiene ya se fugaron
4172 2018-07-17 15:51:45 And did You miss the part where Putin talked about teaming up with the US to oust OPEC. Did you catch that?
Join forces to ensure stable production and stable costs of oil and gas.

4176 2018-07-17 15:51:35 He’s desperate to get back into politics, the democrats are desperate for votes, and the media is desperate for clicks and those sweet, sweet rage comments. This country is dying.
4177 2018-07-17 15:51:31 Great, how do you get oil down to $10 or $20 per barrel, what’s the plan?

If oil can’t fix its price problem, the renewable savings just keep getting bigger.

4182 2018-07-17 15:50:54 Oil royalties are also breathtakingly low. How this country justifies all manner of oppression of Indigenous peoples in the name of the "economy" when this goes on is astounding.

4186 2018-07-17 15:50:24 Putin is an oil salesman.
4187 2018-07-17 15:50:04 Ehh...  Obama combined actions with those words though.  Not responding to Crimea, weakening military responses (see Russian flybys), etc.  Trump is saying nice things to Putin's face and beefing up NATO, upping oil production, more military options, etc.
4188 2018-07-17 15:49:48 True. Unfortunately, Trump has paid off for these people in spades. Multinational oil/gas corps, have no country loyalty - their only loyalty is to the $$$$$.
4189 2018-07-17 15:49:43 Works openly with the Russians how?

*Rebuilding US military

*Undercutting oil prices by boosting US production

*Hundreds of Russian military contractors killed in Syria

*Ending farcical agreement with Russian client state Iran

*Pushing NATO states to meet their agreements

4220 2018-07-17 15:46:43 Trump said the US will compete directly with Russia on gas and energy...when he met with Putin. Trump criticized Germany for a multi-billion Russian deal. Germany is making Russia rich while Trump is supporting American gas & oil. Trumps actions hurt Russian interests.

"Pushes away allies"  ... What... by asking them to beef up their defense spending to potentially combat Russia?  By calling them out for spending billions on Russian oil & gas, which props up Putin. I know these are inconvenient facts, but it's reality.

' $CVX remains technically stronger than $XOM'.

4242 2018-07-17 15:43:57 Oil isn’t the only source of money, pal. An economy based on such a volatile market isn’t such a good idea either (ignoring the whole negative impact on the environment thing).

Is that why .@HouseGOP .@HouseDemocrats .@SenateGOP .@SenateDems aren't condemning tRump? We WANT ANSWERS NOW.

4306 2018-07-17 15:38:26 ... and start treating him like the snake oil salesman he is.
4307 2018-07-17 15:38:23 We have crude oil and we are still drilling for oil in the Chad basin so who cares about palm oil and soya beans? #Sarcasm

4311 2018-07-17 15:37:51 He never was the leader of the free world and never will be. No US president has ever been the leader of the free world. They do as they are told by those with oil and money to line their pockets. @realDonaldTrump is another pawn in the game. Just like his pal @JustinTrudeau
4312 2018-07-17 15:37:50 I m not sure if Africans are aware that Obama has contributed to what Libyans are going through now by Killing Murmur Gudaffi killing him for oil ,now slavery is back in Lybia

4318 2018-07-17 15:37:40 I'm all for consumables, oil, whatever doesn't make that awful skunk smell.  People will smoke in public because they know it's going to be a slap on the wrist since 'it's legal!'.
4319 2018-07-17 15:37:39 You accuse me of not knowing the Standard Oil cartoon and then tell me I'm being condescending? Dude.
4320 2018-07-17 15:37:38 So, now we have the Left screaming for : maintaining sanctions
rebuilding our military
modernizing our nuclear  forces
expanding missile defenses
sending more weapons to our allies
and producing more oil and gas to counter Russia....well, OK #maga
4321 2018-07-17 15:37:33 @gop And his obsession with oil companies and NRA.  Oops, I just realized these are the three areas you are bought and paid for.

4323 2018-07-17 15:37:20 Refinery capacity
UK 1,475,000 bbl/d, 7 refineries
Ireland 71,000 bbl/d, 1 refinery

Ireland can move the oil reserves around to keep the EU happy, but they don't have refining capacity and will run out of petrol pretty soon if their single refinery is down for maintenance
4324 2018-07-17 15:37:18 We're bullies, not fighters. We don't go to war with strong countries, much less nuclear capable countries. NK has no oil. Your argument makes no sense. Also, Bush and Jr got us into endless wars, not Obama.

4330 2018-07-17 15:36:46 I'm aware of the Standard Oil reference, which is how I know that it's part of a much more complex history of conspiratorial imagery that sometimes shades into the frankly antisemitic.
4331 2018-07-17 15:36:44 I’ll tell you the reason. Fake45 wants to be as rich as the oil barons and thinks Putin can help him. Obviously, with a dictator by his side, it’ll be a cakewalk.

4334 2018-07-17 15:36:21 As a Jew, I'm tired of people taking my ethnicity to defend power. You are being a charlatan and helping actual anti-semites and that makes me mad. I am also annoyed by your unwillingness to say 'oh it's a famous Standard Oil cartoon, sorry'. But thanks for the condescension.
4335 2018-07-17 15:36:06 Coconut oil is highly nourishing and does wonders to most hair types. Castor oil is another oil that is beneficial to the hair.

Little initial impact from Fed chair Powell’s testimony on monetary policy
4339 2018-07-17 15:35:33 Still too early for me to conclude Trump's impact on energy markets, but my guess is that it will be either extremely bullish or extremely bearish, not in between.  Strategy is being played and I prefer to wait for the outcome.  Confusion and chaos, might bode well for oil prices
4340 2018-07-17 15:35:25 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. -Psalm 92:10
4341 2018-07-17 15:35:05 Maybe stop the pipeline that is there to sell oil to foreign countries who are investing money into renewable energy and use money where we actually need it
4342 2018-07-17 15:34:50 It's money. Oil money. That's all.

4351 2018-07-17 15:33:59 Yeah, that’s a reasonable thing for Prov and Fed governments to always consider...

...but your only plan seems to be to keep pushing oil and gas. You’ve got to diversify our energy industries and the economy.

4363 2018-07-17 15:32:46 Do they really want the oil and gas shipped by rail? This would increase the cost on every thing from food to wind farms.
4364 2018-07-17 15:32:45 Have you tried castor oil pellets?
4365 2018-07-17 15:32:42 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

4382 2018-07-17 15:31:32 No worries everyone we’re about to be done meddling. You guys can secure your own shipping lanes! Also have fun getting your oil from the Middle East with your collective garbage navies once the Saudis and Iranians finally go after each other.
4383 2018-07-17 15:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet substantive conversation.
4384 2018-07-17 15:31:04 Most forget ! That Putin is not some 3rd world dictator that could be overthrown like Qaddafi or others ! Russia has nuclear capabilities similar to ours ! And to be talking instead of not is better ! Also Russia has vast oil & natural gas reserves and EU countries need them
4385 2018-07-17 15:31:04 Today on the news they are talking about how much oil and natural gas we have if that's true why are we allowing Valero gas stations to operate? And Valero supports terrorism, if we have so much oil why is our fuel prices so high? Anybody care to weigh in on this?

4394 2018-07-17 15:30:42 Inform Indian oil corporation and bp, they will take care of it.
4395 2018-07-17 15:30:35 we tried regulation; that didn't work. we tried deregulation; that didn't work. let's try putting a few oil companies out of business by democratic decree. that would increase demand for sustainable "alternatives" in a hurry.

4398 2018-07-17 15:30:28 What would you have advised Trump to do?

A...Defend the FBI and call Putin a low down snake? 

B... Sell off the rest of our uranium? 

C... Act presidential and continue dialog with Russia?

D... Green Light Germany to buy Russian oil and repel sanctions?

4420 2018-07-17 15:28:47 @carlquintanilla Carl, making us listen to the pomposity and grandstanding of the DEMS is like making us take castor oil.  Although, I give them credit for being far more subdued than usual. Maybe that’s how the DNC wants it.
4421 2018-07-17 15:28:41 I’m thinking it’s oil. He must have been promised billions.
4422 2018-07-17 15:28:40 Snake oil salesman like Obama are good at oily speeches.
4423 2018-07-17 15:28:36 Maybe eventually, but oil is like cash... very useful to many powerful entities that you can't fully track it...

While Iraq’s oil sector accounts for 99 percent of the country’s exports, it represents only 1 percent of Iraq’s jobs, as the vast majority of the positions are held by foreigners.

4436 2018-07-17 15:27:17 Like I said, these were steps getting to today. If Obama really cared, he could have done a lot more than side with oil companies and ignore important protests like Standing Rock.

4455 2018-07-17 15:25:13 How conveniently you forget his actions against Russia are 100Xs more harsh than what Obama, did, e.g. Arming Ukrane, severe sanctions, killing 300 Russians in Syria, sending troops to the Balkains, raising billions of extra $$$s in NATO, taking oil/gas sales away.
4456 2018-07-17 15:25:13 2/2 Trump’s been hard on Russia. Bomb Syria 2x, killed 200 Russian (RS) soldiers, put sanctions on RS, armed Ukraine against RS, expelled 60 spies from US, enact policy for US to b lrgst oil producer which hurts RS & got NATO to pay extra $34 B which is bad for RS.

4458 2018-07-17 15:24:57 Turns out it's not Ireland's plan for strategic oil reserves. It's Ireland's plan for meeting an EU directive. They pay UK refineries to store oil because the UK is in the EU. They will swap it for oil in EU refineries elsewhere, but they still don't have refineries of their own.

4468 2018-07-17 15:23:31 Things I’ve learned in 2018, so far:

-you don’t have to go on a diet/starve yourself to nourish your body and eat healthy

-find the oil that works for your skin

-gym is much more than a place where you to lose lbs

-treat men the way they treat you and watch them get confused

4480 2018-07-17 15:22:13 The inflation rate edged up to 2.9% in June 2018 from 2.8% in May, matching market expectations. It is the highest rate since Feb 2012 when inflation was at 2.9%, due to rising prices for oil and gasoline. The last time inflation was above 2.9% was in Dec 2011 when it reached 3%

4485 2018-07-17 15:21:27 We have surpassed Russia as exporter of oil. Trump scolded Merkek for buying oil from Russia. Putin’s biggest concern  if you saw the summit was the expansion of NATO closer to Russia and getting stronger. Due to Trump

4506 2018-07-17 15:19:32 Russia had libertarian, Milton Friedman, “greed is good” economics in the 1990s. Wrecked the country. Putin saved Russia’s economy by putting oil & gas under state control and reintroducing elements of central planning. That’s why he’s so popular.

4563 2018-07-17 15:14:09 Also, it was a mostly Saudi team.... that would be the same Saudi nation who are financed via oil sales and who finance terroism all over the world. I get what you’re doing, Trump is a shit. But this is a miss
4564 2018-07-17 15:14:07 やったああああああああ( *˙ω˙*)و ｸﾞｯ!
4565 2018-07-17 15:13:45 Do a little Google search. Oil prices did not drop during the current administration. In fact, prices started a significant drop in early summer 2014. The current increase is only part to blame on the current administration as it has backed out of Iran deal.
4566 2018-07-17 15:13:44 No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long, slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old. Bring wood and oil.
4567 2018-07-17 15:13:42 mending yg oil oilan deh
4568 2018-07-17 15:13:36 好きです
4569 2018-07-17 15:13:34 There is no buzz at all in Alberta regarding oil and gas, the future really is not bright with this industry. Cannabis buzz has completely taken over, it is saving people in this province, myself included.
4570 2018-07-17 15:13:19 The Irish oil story gets better. The "national security" oil reserve rules are made by the EU, not nation states. Ireland isn't allowed to decide where or how much oil reserves it keeps for it's own "national security"
4571 2018-07-17 15:13:16 ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶！
4572 2018-07-17 15:13:12 Obama is a snake oil salesman.

4573 2018-07-17 15:12:51 Kamu pake cleansing oil apa??
4574 2018-07-17 15:12:46 *sighs heavily*
Good old Olive Oil trick ...  
Freakin really ? Seriously ? You're that much uninventive that you have to go back to 90's shenanigans bullshit ?

I guess even in religion nostalgia is a cycle ...
4575 2018-07-17 15:12:45 Like the Conservatives supported by IDU, which Harper leads? Or like Kenney, who won't reveal his donors? Or Fraser Institute that gets foreign funding? Or the oil and gas companies with foreign ownership or investment?

Why does foreign $ only bother you if it's for environment?
4576 2018-07-17 15:12:43  I should stop . I'm going to go finish watching Curb Your Enthusiasm. Breaking Bad finished downloading so that's next :)
4577 2018-07-17 15:12:22 I asked her what did she want for breakfast and she immediately started making her cinnamon pancake mix. She even pour cooking oil into the pan 
4578 2018-07-17 15:12:18 I tried to work on my report, but I couldn't find my bottle of oil.
4579 2018-07-17 15:12:08 that fake ambre oil that they sell at castleton really had me breaking out lol this why i need to stick w what i know
4580 2018-07-17 15:12:05 I do and my hair doesn't get greasy anymore! I think the idea is our scalps overproduce oil because we strip it out by shampooing so frequently, when we stop doing that it learns to balance things out.
4581 2018-07-17 15:12:03 Heyy @Sy_Afifi from ape yang aku bace oil clensing ni penting sebab die deep clean into our pores so tak kira pakai ape pun tetap kena guna oil cleanser supaya pores kita lagi bersih gitu  tp macam kak mai kate tak semestinya guna oil clenaser je yang penting double cleansing
4582 2018-07-17 15:12:01 I need to go get me and oil change tho first
4583 2018-07-17 15:12:00 Ketika budget belanja skincare bulan ini sisa puluhan ribu doang dan ga sengaja numpahin cleansing oil sampe tinggal 4% itu rasanya..

pengen hmmmmm ala nisa syaban semaleman
4584 2018-07-17 15:11:48 Yes. I’ve had it and it’s very very good.  There is an drop of MCT oil you add as well .  Supposed to fill you up
4585 2018-07-17 15:11:45 #WRONG.

The #US #TradeDeficit sends money to #China who uses it to purchase oil & gas from #Iran & #Russia, all three of which are enemies of #America.

Open trading is funding our enemies = American lives.

So, again, tell us how LONG TERM "open trading" serves the US well?
4586 2018-07-17 15:11:37 ！！！
4587 2018-07-17 15:11:37 I thought with a condom since condom has lefura(oil)
4588 2018-07-17 15:11:36 What would you have advised Trump to do?

A...Defend the FBI and call Putin a low down snake? 

B... Sell off the rest of our uranium? 

C... Act presidential and continue dialog with Russia?

D... Green Light Germany to buy Russian oil and repel sanctions?
4589 2018-07-17 15:11:17 Agreed, however that doesn't mean it is snake oil to everyone. What is poison to some is medication to others and an inoculation to others still.
4590 2018-07-17 15:11:10 If one of flour, palm oil, rice vinegar and dried noodle soup, is basically everything you get something a little bit to
4591 2018-07-17 15:11:08 Blundering? I will bet U trump at the end of it all will be proven right and this meeting will be proven successful..Trump did not beat your snake oil salesmen by being ignorant.  I dont see Democrats wanting to be like the GOP, but daily I see GOP spineless wonders caving. #STOP
4592 2018-07-17 15:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: raw crust with moist motor oil and philly beef.

4595 2018-07-17 15:10:52 なにそれ…こわいね…
4596 2018-07-17 15:10:50 Russia = our Christian ally.  Russia saved Butts in WWII.  Russia liberated my Dad from a Japanese POW camp.  Marxism and Communism = bad.  BLM = veiled attempt to allow Black Islam to kill all whites, doing it in South Africa, allied with Islam using oil $$ to conquer capitalism
4597 2018-07-17 15:10:50 Expecting FINISHING from best peenisher BUDHO DHONI is like expecting A fish to leave without WATER... A PICKLE TO be made without OIL , AN ENGINEERING COLLEGE GUARANTEEING 100% PLACEMENT.. LOL
4598 2018-07-17 15:10:28 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
4599 2018-07-17 15:10:27 Olive oil nya merk apa kaakkk
4600 2018-07-17 15:10:18 Really? I remember when they dropped so low that the oil fields in ND had to shut down.
4601 2018-07-17 15:10:07 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
4602 2018-07-17 15:10:02 I know I’ve just finished a fic editing project when my Amazon suggestions are full of ads for beard oil, surfboards, and trope-y “romance” novels. #barkingupallthewrongtrees
4603 2018-07-17 15:10:00 WHOA!
4604 2018-07-17 15:09:59 Does that mean Twycross Zoo will not be using anything with palm oil in, palm oil is not just in nestle products but it is in other things if I were to have a pizza and ask to see whats in it  will it be palm oil free ?
4605 2018-07-17 15:09:44 ya know..... this is about to make me sound real stupid but....... i’ve never thought about the fact that olive oil literally is the oil from olives.....
4606 2018-07-17 15:09:40 Oil never forgive myself
4607 2018-07-17 15:09:32 Car repairs:
Oil change 50
Brakes 300
Tires 5,000
Windshield wipers 50
Alignment 3000
Filters 500
Hoses 300
Fluids replaced 500
 
Total plus labor = 1,000,000.13

Then the clerk asks “How will you be paying today?”

Me: Y’all can have the car I’ll take the bus!
4608 2018-07-17 15:09:28 I want to start a dev hash tag if you're burning the midnight oil coding let everyone know . . . Via #codewolves 

Open to better suggestions  just like the idea of a tag for those coding in the am!
4609 2018-07-17 15:09:26 And when he gets 68 , he will want 70:)
4610 2018-07-17 15:09:20 No ginger garlic paste though. All other items ground to a fine paste with tamarind / kokum extract & fresh coconut. Boiled well with salt, freshly sliced ginger & green chillies . Add Fish of choice & then top with coconut oil & curry leaves.
4611 2018-07-17 15:09:20 aAmen to that - I also used garlic oil on the bread I had the baked beans I was making on.

I want to sweat garlic.
4612 2018-07-17 15:09:16 She weeps olive oil! The christians will have a field day with this, lol . . .
4613 2018-07-17 15:09:07 Kills Middle-Eastern civilians for oil and now speak about humanity in South Africa.
Dude, go to hell.
4614 2018-07-17 15:08:59 Today’s BOGO!! These 3 oils together in the diffuser smell amazing! Let me know if you would like to order these 3 oils. Only $29 wholesale price for all three 15ml bottles of oil!

4618 2018-07-17 15:08:43 Depends on the quality of shirtless selfie you’d take with it
4619 2018-07-17 15:08:42 SONIC MANIA PLUS IS OUT YEEHAW GAMERS NOW I CAN PLAY UP TO OIL OCEAN ZONE BEFORE GIVING UP AGAIN
4620 2018-07-17 15:08:19 I have SO much I have to get done today after work

Oil change 
Wash my car 
Go grocery shopping 
Finish laundry
Pack my bags 
& all I really want is to nap
4621 2018-07-17 15:08:14 I thought Scotts might be smarter than some Americans who buy the MSM lies. If he likes him so much, why tell Germany not to give him money for oil. Why would he bomb Syria?  Why the sanctions?  If he’s Putin’s friend, Putin sure doesn’t need enemys.
4622 2018-07-17 15:08:10 4호선 길음역(oil station)
4623 2018-07-17 15:08:07 So why does this "low oil price" recession only seem to affect Alberta?
4624 2018-07-17 15:08:03 Ask him if people from XIX century were oil painted.
4625 2018-07-17 15:07:59 The price of crude oil then was 140 dollars now it has reduced to 70 dollars. Still petrol price 80 and diesel price 70
What nonse...

4627 2018-07-17 15:07:39 The industrial war machine complex and Big oil are a way bigger threat to democracy. You should see how many democracy's the CIA has meddled with.
4628 2018-07-17 15:07:32 SO your long? Catalyst? Charts? or  just an oil play?
4629 2018-07-17 15:07:27 And this was after telling our NATO allies they need to increase defense spending so we can contain Russia and telling them not to buy Russian oil. #WorstSpyEver
4630 2018-07-17 15:07:24 I always get my oil changed every 3 to 4,000 miles and whenever I go they're like welllll you really don't have to until 5-7500. I'll never wait that long
4631 2018-07-17 15:07:21 Ever since i got my oil changed I feel like I'm gliding on a stick of butter
4632 2018-07-17 15:07:19 Worse than an oil spill in the gulf of Mexico...

"The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant." (Isaiah 24:5)
4633 2018-07-17 15:07:18 
4634 2018-07-17 15:07:18 From oil to gold when will they learn hmm
4635 2018-07-17 15:07:16 An iniquity of oil changes.
4636 2018-07-17 15:07:16 With all the oil and gas we produce now, we have all the leverage anyway. We don't have to yell and scream.
4637 2018-07-17 15:07:13 Thing had to dry out for like 35 days before I was able to sand and oil it. Another 5 days of sanding and oiling and it should be done.
4638 2018-07-17 15:07:09 Attacking an ally for relying on Russia for oil while also saying that Putin is a good guy now doesn't make any sense at all. Is Russia an adversary or not?
4639 2018-07-17 15:07:07 It is a video showing why they want us to believe Haiti is a poor country.  When the truth is they have the UN soldiers there robbing it of GOLD OIL (they have more than Venezuela)  will see if I can find another way to tag u.
4640 2018-07-17 15:06:56 apa ingredient dlm tu? argan oil je ke
4641 2018-07-17 15:06:44 And cinnamon oil to go with 
4642 2018-07-17 15:06:43 Trump cares about money first. This is about oil money....he doesnt give a shit about the American people.....only business. It's all hes ever cared about. Obama was also a sellout to corporations, but not to other countries. Our economy grew during his presidency. Bush though...
4643 2018-07-17 15:06:39 I’m at Honda getting my oil changed and a man walks in with a puppy.......A PUPPY!

4645 2018-07-17 15:06:13 Maybe we can find a good reason
to send a child off to war
so what if we're controlling all the oil
Is it worth a child dying for?
If long life is what we all live for
then long life will come to pass
Anything is better than a picture of the child in a cloud of gas

4646 2018-07-17 15:06:11 Iraq was not connected to 9/11. That was Bush's bonus war for oil.
4647 2018-07-17 15:06:07 One mtb dropped off for a new bottom bracket and  to investigate the shed load of oil around the right hand fork seal 
4648 2018-07-17 15:06:03 I just have one chapter to outline before I can start my Sequel to Oil Paintings and Late Night Jam Sessions. Thank you for your patience; the decline in my health has made it very difficult to create as much as I would like this summer.
4649 2018-07-17 15:05:51 I used to have an air popper. Tastes great No chemicals, no oil. You don’t want know how they make movie theater popcorn, like asking what goes into a sausage

4651 2018-07-17 15:05:47 そうだぞ。
4652 2018-07-17 15:05:45 That the Russia and the U.S. govts are in competitive collaboration to expand their oil and gas extraction is extremely dangerous for climate change and worthy of wide media coverage.
Thank you for posting this.
4653 2018-07-17 15:05:44 Oil field engineers make 80k a year right out of college but you're most likely going to be cut after that first year the way the prices on gas move around

4655 2018-07-17 15:05:37 I get the best hippie/natural vibe from Hélène. I can just imagine her outside on a beautiful deck hula hooping and listening to relaxing/ instrumental music with lavender oil and hot tea. Sign me up
4656 2018-07-17 15:05:23 California has heavier oil than us, they've increased their oil exports by over 300,000 barrels a day from 2016 and earlier.
4657 2018-07-17 15:05:05 may ganun din olive oil tuleg
4658 2018-07-17 15:05:04 Guys what would we do without olive oil spray
4659 2018-07-17 15:05:02 うんうん！！ぜひともやりましょ〜(*´▽｀*)
4660 2018-07-17 15:05:02 @ SOJUNG COMMENTING THAT ASHLEY’S COCKTAIL LOOKED LIKE RED PEPPER’S OIL AND WINDEX
4661 2018-07-17 15:04:58 yeah but most of the rainforest being destroyed is for animal agriculture not palm oil
4662 2018-07-17 15:04:57 The future of transportation is me paying politicians to keep us pumping oil, making cars, and strangling start-ups like this out who dare to threaten our profits.
4663 2018-07-17 15:04:53 But if my words are that powerful......then.........may Republicans lose the house and Senate, lose the presidency, and never ever come back (even in other forms). Let's hope that worked :)
4664 2018-07-17 15:04:45 ok yoongi’s uh cos that salt grain whatever the oil hit him

yoongi you are making me soft
4665 2018-07-17 15:04:42 With this Texas heat I’m bought to try that out cause coconut oil don’t be lasting long at all lol
4666 2018-07-17 15:04:38 Iya, aku sih pagi malem. Karena ak ngapunya cleansing oil jd aku pake mc viva yg lemon, fw nya citra
4667 2018-07-17 15:04:21 I came to get the oil change that’s it. Idc what else you recommend be done. We will cross that bridge when we get there.
4668 2018-07-17 15:03:58 No one said 5 mill pay for 52mill. Merely pionted out that the return is not as much as paid in. And re oil i see you ask for ref but show none.
4669 2018-07-17 15:03:45 And what are you doing?

Maybe NATO can help?

They must not have oil like Venezuela.
4670 2018-07-17 15:03:37 Obama removed Reagan-era nuclear deterrents from the Euro theater, did nothing on Ukrainian conflict, Crimea, passenger jet shot down. His actions cleared path for oil delivery via Black Sea from Caucasus.
4671 2018-07-17 15:03:29 About to get an oil change for the whip
4672 2018-07-17 15:03:26 I want more humps. Meaning, I want rises so we can brake the soul of ultra bulls and hump them more (meaning we short the shutout of them). Lactic acid must fill my lower region muscles.
4673 2018-07-17 15:03:10 I hate going to get my oil changed.
4674 2018-07-17 15:03:06 เดวๆๆๆๆๆ
4675 2018-07-17 15:03:05 My dad would have told me to take salmon oil capsules and ACV. He thinks that’s the cure for everything!
4676 2018-07-17 15:03:02 The current pipeline carries enough for current needs. The new #KMX is about increasing Tarsands output by 40% or more. If we burn the 173 bill barrels of oil in the Tarsands, Canada (pop of less than 1/2 of 1% of earth) uses up 30% of remaining global carbon budget. Fair? Right?
4677 2018-07-17 15:03:01 This is a great photo of these two! 
4678 2018-07-17 15:02:54 Germany not paying its pledge amount to support NATO. They want protection from Russia,but not willing to pay for it. They are buying billions of dollars of gas and oil from Russia,giving them billions to build up their military. Dose this make sense,Stop buying German automobile
4679 2018-07-17 15:02:51 My grandfather was stationed at Hickam Field when pearl harbor was bombed. He passed away many years ago, i wonder what he would think of that?

4681 2018-07-17 15:02:42 You could just come upstairs and ask if we got some oil to spare

4683 2018-07-17 15:02:18 does this title imply that RBG is on the Supreme Court only "only on the basis of sex"?

4686 2018-07-17 15:02:02 Oil king waiting you
4687 2018-07-17 15:01:58 Putin & Trump are coming for Canada (we have oil & +importantly, we have WATER) that's why they installed #DougFord, are trying to railroad @JustinTrudeau and are beginning with the hateful Trumpian anti-immigrant rhetoric.

 #TrumpResign #trade
4700 2018-07-17 15:00:56 @UpfrontKPFA it's not complicated. Putin has nothing on Trump that Trump cares about. Trump only cares about the oil. US and Russia need each other to get the oil. Trump will do anything to get a piece of it. That's all. Nothing else matters to either of them except the money.

4708 2018-07-17 15:00:12 I saw an older man at a gas station asking if he could buy a quart of oil. The girl working had no idea what he was asking for. This went back two or three times and then I suggested he wanted a litre of oil, which she understood and got for him.
4709 2018-07-17 15:00:09 Dems and MSM forgot @realDonaldTrump exposing and castigating Merkel's Russian oil pipeline, cajoling NATO members to pay more for NATO’s costs, bombed Syrian Air Force and chemical weapon sites AND ordered US forces to kill over 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria. #RussianPuppet?

4713 2018-07-17 15:00:03 People need to know that Nutella should be boycotted anyway for the use of palm oil alone. it contains 32% fat and 58% sugar so not really 'healthy' at all. Far better to drink a good cocoa and eat a few hazelnuts.

4727 2018-07-17 14:59:06 I’m sure you want that to be the truth but why would he call out Germany on buying oil from Russia if putin had something up his sleeve that could ruin him.
4728 2018-07-17 14:58:51 ya gurl loves a free oil change
4729 2018-07-17 14:58:43 Banks will lead the TSX higher in that event along with oil as the make up 53% of index. Hopefully a deal on NAFTA be 4 mid-term elections
4730 2018-07-17 14:58:42 Once upon a time they had adequate storage. Ras Lanuf/Es Sider use to have around 12 million barrels, today that number is around 1 million. Seven years of poor maintenance, civil war, port destruction, ISIS etc will do that. Q is when do oil services companies come back?
4731 2018-07-17 14:58:39 Ok I get it. But what would be the point of getting rid of Putin. Splitting Russia and taking possession of the oil and gas?
4732 2018-07-17 14:58:35 Lmfao we are not even close to nuclear war.  Russia is weak....their economy is oil and weapons. We dont need them....they need us. If you are afraid of nuclear war u have no common sense

4736 2018-07-17 14:58:19 Tucked away on the #HLPF2018 website, "that over 3.5 mil kg of carbon will be emitted at HLPF 2018 from air travel alone. This is equivalent to 13,805,650 km driven by an average passenger vehicle or the consumption of 8,103 barrels of oil."
4737 2018-07-17 14:58:16 More efficient than oil-soaked LA is not a high hurdle. NYC metro area is pretty oil soaked. Lots of cars. Lots of congestion. London too.
4738 2018-07-17 14:58:05 @CNN still refers to Obama as president. Let that sink in. #CNNFakeNews @Obama is a snake oil salesman & Johannesburg is buying.

4742 2018-07-17 14:57:39 Hi! Organic Palm Fruit Oil is a key functional ingredient for our soy spreads, helping to prevent separation of our soy flour and soy oil. We source it from a U.S. based company called Ciranda (“Circle” in Spanish). Their direct supplier is AgroPalma, located in Brazil. AgroPalma

4745 2018-07-17 14:57:19 We can defend their oil, they can't 
4746 2018-07-17 14:57:17 Unlike the engine oil, when changing transmission fluid, it does not all drain in the pan. In fact, most of it stays in the valve body, torque converter and transmission lines.
4747 2018-07-17 14:57:11 Stovetop- heat them through covered and then crank up the heat with a little oil to get the crunch back. Whatever you do don’t microwave

4763 2018-07-17 14:55:28 How Trump calling out Germany on FUNDING PUTINS ECONOMY with their Oil Pipeline is benefiting Putin is just ignorant

You are an IDIOT - you need to just go HOME already. You have been fighting Trumps Agenda that the PPL VOTED FOR even those in your State that you reprsent
4764 2018-07-17 14:55:17 Well the volvo passed with a advisory for a oil leak yay
4765 2018-07-17 14:55:14 They are. Again, happy to discuss it, but not if I'm gonna be talking to a brick wall--no need to waste our time.

4767 2018-07-17 14:55:03 OIL 15M is gestating right now. You want to WATCH for a break below 66.38 intraday support for DWT OR above  66.97 =20MA to confirm UWT. Patience.
4768 2018-07-17 14:54:51 Germany has done very well. It has also had free money post war, pays no defence funds of any significance at all, has an undervalued currency at the expense of others. Ask yourself this... what happens when the Euro is called? EU never recovered after 1974 oil crisis either.

4777 2018-07-17 14:53:55 Tina Joemat Peterson must be tried for fraudulent conduct in oil deal. She must be fully investigated, including her collusion with her handler, Zuuma !! This must be undertaken now, not next month. This country has enough of brazen theft and racketeering !!
4778 2018-07-17 14:53:41 It Can Be... I usually put something like 4 spoons of olive oil when I cook the sauce for 2 people. Take a picture next time, I want to see!

4780 2018-07-17 14:53:26 Just okay for her to sell gas and oil delivered through a pipeline she likes to protest. Typical hypocrisy of the activist sect.

4830 2018-07-17 14:47:00 Where they take back, Eastern Europe, Syria, Iran, Lebanon and the West gets, more expensive oil, and more fox news
4831 2018-07-17 14:46:58 Agree that it would be push back from the left but Republicans control government and we should stop buying the oil that keeps that hideous regime alive. No excuses.
4832 2018-07-17 14:46:58 Case in Point: What you said about Trump’s overall goals via Russian/Germany & Oil makes sense. But it STILL takes a leap of faith to arrive there ... and you are trusting a process that looks awfully similar to treason considering election meddling (I mean, it still does)
4833 2018-07-17 14:46:53 Same on Crosby beach, found lots of palm oil debris during today’s beach clean. Most of it on the strand line.

4835 2018-07-17 14:46:53 Although (obviously) one was a violent attack and the other wasn't, there are really important similarities between the two. If you want to know, happy to share; if you're just wanting to exchange talking points, let's skip it.

If you think "not muh president" is a reason to completely forgo a tepid relationship you're an idiot. It's why Obama wanted to parlay.
4841 2018-07-17 14:46:08 What, and leave an orange oil slick? No let's colonize the planet mercury, and him and the royal consort can start the festivities by leaving tomorrow.
4842 2018-07-17 14:46:07 the election is long over & intelligence agencies are not in business to be respected but to be effective Obama would not let them stop the meddling -the CIA did not have to follow his directive by law. Brennan is tweeting his way into a big fail-great job with Putin LNG & oil
4843 2018-07-17 14:45:56 Maybe if we tell the GOP that the control of oil and gas in other countries will be under Russia instead of America, they might do something.

4849 2018-07-17 14:45:29 Hi I’m sliding into this conversation because it was in my feed. In 2014 the nra held a leadership convention in Indianapolis at Lucas oil stadium. Butina had infiltrated nra circles posing as a gun rights activist. Pushing for extremely lax laws.

4864 2018-07-17 14:44:10 Octopi have definitely been used in other political cartoons and Standard Oil could be the reference they were going for here. But there's also a long history of Octopi in antisemitic cartoons so it's iffy to me when they're using them to depict Sandberg and Zuck
4865 2018-07-17 14:44:05 So my XR2 has decided to have an oil leak. Drive to work, go to leave work and a puddle of oil. I then left it overnight in the drive and no oil. So it seems it only leaks when I’m at work!? Lol

4871 2018-07-17 14:43:29 I don't think that is the case. The government is benefiting from extra $$$ earned by exporting oil & other commodities. However, this extra money is channeled into offshore tax heavens, and population is taxed even more.
4872 2018-07-17 14:43:22 But oil is gonna sky rocket again. Everybody knows it. It would be nice to pay for your little olympic dream with money that we actually have Carter, not pretend borrowed money so you can turn around and complain taxes arent high enough. Get a grip

Merkel probly got that natural gas for a song & it's a situation of inter-dependence based on mutual interests. What Russia gets outed for, we do in secret.
4894 2018-07-17 14:40:39 Yeah absolutely nothing to do with lobbyist culture and need to continuously extract resources such as oil and farm unsustainably to make profit

It does show that the EU is planning for an economic war, though. Ireland is really fucked if they go there

4981 2018-07-17 14:31:39 THINGS is actually entertaining, and I figured anyone likely to watch these movies has already seen it. I swapped in LAS VEGAS BLOODBATH instead, since it has WAY more hot oil wrestling.

4987 2018-07-17 14:31:03 @elonmusk just curious, have you thought about battery powered scooters for China and India to reduce air and noise pollution? Those two stroke oil burners are earth killers. Keep up the great work.

Add coconut milk (optional) & fish pieces of choice and simmer till the fish is cooked. Best eaten the next day

5004 2018-07-17 14:29:20 I don’t think you realize how much money the over seas oil market would bring to this country.  It’s a game changer.

5010 2018-07-17 14:28:45 Th sooner wetern Europe dispenses with fuel oil and moves on with renewables and hydrogen fuel the better, safer, healthier and cheaper, aside from reducing or totally dispensing with dependance for fuel supplies from rogue, agressive, imperialist and despotic countries,

5021 2018-07-17 14:27:51 my dad used to change the oil but between disposal of it, the time it took and then the aftermath/clean up it just wasn't worth it.
5022 2018-07-17 14:27:50 I read an article saying it's really corrupt due to oil money.  That's my enduring view of the country.

5025 2018-07-17 14:27:47 Will the olympics fill the downtown core again? Nope. You need big oil to truly put us back on the world stage. If we had oil money in Calgary again, the olympics are a no brainer.
5026 2018-07-17 14:27:44 debt explodes?  Russia has a GDP that is a tenth of ours and is dependent entirely on oil and natural gas.   Pat’s column misses the mark and you are an apologist.
5027 2018-07-17 14:27:37 Just burnt my finger in boiling oil how clever am I 
5028 2018-07-17 14:27:31 (2/4) Two workers at Libya’s largest #oil field (#Sharara) were kidnapped this weekend leading to production declines. Important to monitor for the situation's ripple effect. Ursa data showed a large draw in #Rotterdam stocks after some Libyan exports halted.
5029 2018-07-17 14:27:27 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
5030 2018-07-17 14:27:25 Today, I get to explain for the third time (and be right) that the air coming out of my HVAC system smells like the oil used to lubricate moving parts of a motor/machine (like the fan) is burning. Overheating. A distinctive exhaust smell. I have said this from the start.
5031 2018-07-17 14:27:23 Meralco bill is up 40% since Feb 2018 with almost the same consumption. 

This is what happens when oil is up and the US Dollar is up. Inflation just continue to go up.

How will this convert into Meralco dividends over the next few months. 

#Inflation #Consumption
5032 2018-07-17 14:27:20 Tell that jackass it's not the Bill of Needs.
5033 2018-07-17 14:27:19 "Great customer service! This was my second time coming for an oil change and I will be coming back again :)" @Groupon #HappyCustomer
5034 2018-07-17 14:27:15 Why is everyone bothered about what Trump said? All countries try to manipulate elections. We did it in Israel we overthrow countries leaders supposedly for their benefit in order to get oil and maintain Petro dollar. Russia creating false stories is no big deal the MSM does it.
5035 2018-07-17 14:27:14 Unusually high volume and trade count in $NUGT today. It's 2nd most active symbol (after $NFLX and before crude oil futures)
5036 2018-07-17 14:27:07 came downstairs to make coffee n mom looks at my wet hair n instead of assuming i just showered (which i did) she, being a typical brown mother, asks “did u just put oil in ur hair?” 

a major uff moment smh
5037 2018-07-17 14:26:58 Watching @theranchnetflix, the pipeline storyline perfectly illustrates the turmoil produced by oil money in rural communities. #geographyiseverywhere

5039 2018-07-17 14:26:48 Last night I decided to shave & leave my mustache. I had a good laugh about it & went to bed. I woke up this morning I found 2 quarts of Baby Oil & keys to a 1993 Chevy Conversion Van under my pillow. The Mustache Fairy is real, kids. Please shave responsibly.

5042 2018-07-17 14:26:39 There is a War on commodities to mask the fragility of America financial system. In the process they are destroying farmers, oil producers, mining companies, investors & the businesses that support them. Using High Frequency Trading & Collusion. @nntaleb @Fahy_Co @RobertMCutler
5043 2018-07-17 14:26:37 It's surprising yes, but the modelling shows that the loss of GDP is almost entirely attributable to oil price.
5044 2018-07-17 14:26:36 About to open my own garage. Door was making an awful noise when I opened it. Little dab of oil on the hinge and it's like new. Was worth the entire afternoon it took.
5045 2018-07-17 14:26:27 My dad gets paid 80$ to change someones oil amd it inly costd him 13$
5046 2018-07-17 14:26:19 Filled up my tank, got an oil change, paid my tithes. Saving the rest 
5047 2018-07-17 14:26:10 A huge hurdle no one talks about is meal planning. When to get what ingredients. So get long lasting healthy ingredients, like eggs and frozen veggies. Fry the veggies with a bit of oil, then add eggs and scramble. No planning, healthy, quick and easy with few dishes.
5048 2018-07-17 14:26:09 I burnt my wrist when making chips for my dinner one time, i was being careful but underestimated how high oil can jump. luckily the burn was minor
5049 2018-07-17 14:26:08 Oil trading chatroom update #OOTT : Something happening in Brent markets driving CFD traders into the chatroom today demanding "Buy Now?"or "ARE YOU SHORT?" Many using "burner" handles (no cred) so probably traders at big refining houses wanting to be nameless. No expletives yet.

5055 2018-07-17 14:25:34 ... and if no any oil in the Middle East found.. Each country needs weapon. A lot of cutting edge weapon for protection. If you don't have nuclear weapon you are under the risk of attacks. And this happens in 21 century with "civilized" world..
5056 2018-07-17 14:25:27 I thought I saw the Sexy As Fuck Truck go past once and immediately leaped in front of it.  Turns out it was a 16-wheeler carting cane oil and I was in hospital for eight months.

5062 2018-07-17 14:24:25 "Bad for Russia" - stop treating the people with disdain, we are not stupid.

Park your business mind / interests to the side, instead of trying to make dollars from oil with Putin through the back door. The world is watching with interest.
5063 2018-07-17 14:24:22 As A Oil fan I'm on board with you saying they're annoying. Especially over the past two years. If I got a dime everytime I heard one complain about the refs I would likely have ~$50 by now.
5064 2018-07-17 14:24:14 get aubergine. cut slices (round). flour, eggs and then in oil
for the sauce take garlic, smash it, vinegar, cream
5065 2018-07-17 14:24:09 Chop three teaspoons of olive oil and bring to a boil.
5066 2018-07-17 14:23:55 If you think @realDonaldTrump  didn’t fight and hurt Russia & Putin badly you would be wrong. Remember the oil pipeline going from Russia to Germany? Trump Won! I wouldn’t trust the head of agencies trying to remove him from office. @charliekirk11 @SebGorka
5067 2018-07-17 14:23:54 I caught part of Putin's remarks that he was still mad about lower oil prices and places some blame on the US for this driving the economy down.
5068 2018-07-17 14:23:52 How do you know that alien spacecrafts run on oil?
5069 2018-07-17 14:23:44 Oil change. Then to the bank. Then to the eye doctor.

5072 2018-07-17 14:23:20 The same can be said by any business owner. Because that is what business is. If the pipeliner doesn't do the job than the oil companies would never get their product. But there are no employees that have their pay guaranteed. You do the job you get paid you slack you dont simple
5073 2018-07-17 14:23:15 We’re Liverpool & ain’t run by Oil barons or any Orgalichs parse!We Spend Wisely & balance the books accordingly.Klopp has generated a massive profit for the Club in Player sales than any gaffer in the Premier League.Can’t Blame Him for putting that Coutinho into Good use!
5074 2018-07-17 14:22:50 So you say it was the price of oil and nothing to do with banks.
5075 2018-07-17 14:22:36 Also need to change my oil 
5076 2018-07-17 14:22:36 My dad prides himself on changing the oil. Says he can do it way cheaper. Problem is he’ll say that and 3 weeks later he hasn’t done it yet. Best to just eat the hour and the $30 and be done with it lol
5077 2018-07-17 14:22:35 Just remembered I broke my giant bottle of Egyptian Goddess perfume oil the other night and im mad all over again lol
5078 2018-07-17 14:22:30 You Mr president, your party ZANU PF is the one that funds, sponsor, oil and celebrate violence
5079 2018-07-17 14:22:30 Societé Generale: I think long #JPYKRW is still a good trade here even if low vol is hurting #yen. #EURUSD 1.15-1.1850 continues  to hold. So does #EURGBP 0.86-0.90, Soft oil & soft commodities discourage risqué moves to buy #AUD or #CAD
5080 2018-07-17 14:22:22 Yes but that would be greatly alleviated with better access to market.  With land locked oil we're at the mercy of a tiny customer base and what they're willing to pay.  With access to global market we can demand higher prices.
5081 2018-07-17 14:22:09 Oil painting- layer after the other.

5096 2018-07-17 14:20:21 Of course it can not go anywhere without gas and oil, Certainly not against RUSSIA.
5097 2018-07-17 14:20:13 For those who don't believe @kaperoni was right about oil prices look here....He explained that "Iraq exceeded its financial crisis through the financial flows to the budget of 2018 achieved by the rise in oil prices in global markets, which amounted to $ 64 per barrel,"

5100 2018-07-17 14:20:07 We need to tighten the noose on Russia economically. We need to cut Putin off completely. We need to close all the Russian embassies in the US. We need to close our embassies in Russia. Total isolation. Let them eat snow and oil.

5108 2018-07-17 14:18:15 The top oil producing nations keep rotating between Russia, Saudi and the US.
All 3 produce about 11million barrels daily.
At last count Russia was #1 in oil but output fluctuates and any of the above mentioned could be #1.

5121 2018-07-17 14:17:02 #WIPjoy My childhood smelled like motor oil and gasoline. Dad's repair shop was my babysitter. By eight, I answered calls and scheduled appointments. By fifteen I did oil changes and diagnosed engine problems in-between fixing up the Camaro I'd pass my driver’s test on. #tomboy

Tuesday - Oil Change!!
Why should you have you oil & filters changed regularly? 1/2
5131 2018-07-17 14:16:23 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
5132 2018-07-17 14:16:21 This is why the Magnitski (sp.) Act was created here in US. This created sanctions on Russia that they are hoping to be relieved of. This is why Dem.s believe Tillerson was SOS. To remove sanctions so he may start searching for oil in Russia. Broward got his money corruptly.
5133 2018-07-17 14:16:15 someone teach me how to change my oil

5137 2018-07-17 14:15:53 Random thoughts the day after Helsinki - what would stop the U.S. and Russia from joining forces and invading Canada for oil, water and strategic position. What stops them from invading Mexico next? What stops them from Europe after?
5138 2018-07-17 14:15:41 You mean our Ally that has agreed to buy over a billion dollars worth of Oil from our adversary? Hmmmmmm That's interesting.

5147 2018-07-17 14:14:16 Thankyou for your sane take. I am disappointed so many even at FOX are part of this hysteria. What was Trump supposed to do...yell at and humiliate another nuclear and oil super power on the world stage?? No.
5148 2018-07-17 14:14:14 rubbed that boy down w oil and threw him in the oven hopefully not all is lost
5149 2018-07-17 14:14:10 Instead of banning plastic straws why don't we ban building plastic making factories that petrocorps are building left and right now that they fear the world might actually figure out how to use less oil for energy purposes. That might keep some out of the ocean.
5150 2018-07-17 14:14:10 Sir when r u bringing trasformativ ev policy and policy to scrap old vehical which will change the land scape of automobil and petrolium industry and in five year our energy dependance on oil will be also reduse why it is taking time it is not your style of working

5156 2018-07-17 14:13:25 I’ve heard that shampoo is supposed to only be used every few showers due to the fact that it’s purpose is to clean and remove excess oil. Conditioner is supposed to be used every shower to soften and clean
5157 2018-07-17 14:13:22 The pipelines should be heading to Canadian refineries and then to Cdn markets, not overseas or south.
Alberta should be hedging their bets by transitioning to green energy as well. Oil is not a good long term investment.

5160 2018-07-17 14:12:54 Silly comment Bob. The US under Trump owns Russia. NATO $ up. US military spending up. Oil production (Anwr in Alaska) UP. Sanctions against Russia up. US military strategy on Syria and Iran definitive and not favoring Russia.

5164 2018-07-17 14:12:31 It's not. It is treasonous to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Trump is a traitor. He is Putin's puppet. We are sorry you were duped by this ignorant, sobering, snake oil salesman. But he is a traitor and if you still support him. Well, you're all in for treason.

5180 2018-07-17 14:11:22 As for the pipeline deal: trade is as an useful instrument of foreign policy & helps to ease tensions. Many European countries have been buying Russian gas & oil for decades. Even during the Cold War, by the way. Russia is dependent on European money even more, I'd say. /15

5207 2018-07-17 14:08:56 If you are shorting the break on #USOIL just keep in mind that at the moment Crude Oil is having a negative correlation with the DXY(USD) so expect a little volatility. The trade is still valid.

5216 2018-07-17 14:08:37 U.S. reliance of Russian oil imports has fallen as shale oil production has ramped up. Russian oil imports peaked at 624,000 barrels per day in 2011. In 2017 the U.S. still imported 384,000 barrels per day of crude oil and products from Russia. 7 bill in 2017. Sourced by Forbes

5259 2018-07-17 14:04:40 @1a The narrative that the US only meddles in other SOVERIGN NATIONS' political processes out of altruism is false. How about 1953 CIA backed Iranian coup when they moved to nationalize oil production? That has worked out well in the long term, huh?

They're very weird with each other stop trying to be cute about it and call it for what it is. A fucked up deal for the US just for some propert tax cuts and oil that will never make it here
5262 2018-07-17 14:04:36 Just arrived home from the graveyard shift. Morning starts off shitty. I-355 toll expressway is backed up all the way. Decided to take scenic route instead. And then the construction crew backs up traffic by putting fresh oil on 75th St during the busy commute. Felt never ending

5268 2018-07-17 14:03:58 Canada is importing oil. Perhaps using our own would prevent a few tanker crashes. Also, Vancouver is dumping sewage into the Fraser system, killing salmon, which affects the whale populations. But focus on what Alberta’s doing instead.

5299 2018-07-17 14:01:49 Just like N. Korea, the doubters jump to criticize,  but Trump always proved right, Great instincts. Urging Germany to get oil from US instead of Russia will get Putin to Negotiate.

5302 2018-07-17 14:01:42 Dude, there is lots of material gain.  It’s silly to argue that Russia isn’t benefiting. Just the increase in oil prices alone, due to Trump chaos such as pulling out of Iran deal, has been well worth it to Putin and Russians.

A-234 seems to have been designed as an area denial weapon (like VX) and so it is designed to be a thick liquid (like motor oil) that doesn't evaporate or degrade quickly, making areas inaccessible for a long time.

5399 2018-07-17 13:54:10 Bedtime snack: roasted red potatoes in olive oil with rosemary and garlic, tossed with feta cheese, sun dried tomatoes and basil.
5400 2018-07-17 13:54:05 Not many if you used your rifle with camera on the buttstock
5401 2018-07-17 13:54:04 And if you care about your health - you'd eat things like macadamia nuts, olive oil, fish oil, coconut oil and some dairy and not fryer grease. True on any diet. I shoot for an even split 1/3 each poly, monounsaturated and saturated fat with a high omega 3 to 6 ratio.
5402 2018-07-17 13:54:04 Better yet... Oil is oversold in the st.
5403 2018-07-17 13:54:01 i’ll drink a quart of motor oil for $40
5404 2018-07-17 13:53:37 For those who need it for medical reasons, the oil has more medicinal properties.

5416 2018-07-17 13:52:29 ALL of Pres. Trump's previous actions towards Russia clearly shows his Love of America & his Patriotism, he urged Germany to get their oil from US instead of Russia to bring Putin to Negotiate! He's 3 steps ahead of Most People.

5418 2018-07-17 13:52:08  thanks so much. I’ve been meaning to try apricot oil consistently. I’ll see what’s up after a solid month of using such oils. I appreciate that!
5419 2018-07-17 13:52:03 Eucalyptus essential oil, in a facial steam? That tends to open my sinuses up, at least (maybe with saline/Neti pot)
5420 2018-07-17 13:52:02 I went to sleep with the motivation to get up early and get my oil changed and woke up mad asf cause I don’t have somebody else to do it for me

5439 2018-07-17 13:49:57 With EM demand & growth cooling, and the sudden realization that there was a great deal of easily tapped production available that could be ratcheted up quickly - there was no way to support the proposition of higher prices.

*Won't be supposed if oil goes back to $60.

5442 2018-07-17 13:49:51 This is great news if true.

But what about other provinces?
They're also in need of such attention, some more so than Basra.

Dhi Qar is also a major oil/gas supplier yet the province has barely seen any positive progress during the past 15 years.

Iraqi gov needs to act fast.

5491 2018-07-17 13:44:36 Obama did condemn the attack as "an outrage of unspeakable proportions," and joined our (then?) allies in the EU to impose sanctions on Russian banks and oil companies. It wasn't strong enough, but it wasn't entirely pliant like the current holder of the office.

5527 2018-07-17 13:41:30 Undoubtedly big oil hid research, is not accountable for environmental impact and will illicitly influences policy in similar fashion as cigarette companies and should pay. But the buck stops at zoning and transport policy which enables all of it.

5694 2018-07-17 13:25:40 Thank you Ron & Rand Paul for standing up for peace and speaking out against the war mongers. Pres. Trump admits Russia is one of our COMPETITORS in the world governments quest for oil, LNG etc. Better to negotiate resources than cont. the horrific wars over silk road spoils.

5733 2018-07-17 13:21:51 You just need to look to other oil rich nations around the world and see how prosperous they are without having to support UK But then that would go against the nonsense you're happy to spout in defence of the UK
5734 2018-07-17 13:21:49 They dont use the word "War" now. They use the word "Democracy" especially when they find oil on other countries.
5735 2018-07-17 13:21:47 I believe ALL of President Trump's previous tough actions against Russia are proof of his American Patriotism & he is trying to prevent problems. His wanting Germany to get oil from US will bring Putin to BARGIN!

5776 2018-07-17 13:18:00 Exactly. Mr. Kenney says he is pro energy, but IMHO his policies would hurt Alberta oil/gas in the medium to long-term by hindering de-carbonization, frittering away the competitive advantage of an early lead over AB's competitors. I support AB 100%.

5969 2018-07-17 12:59:49 Add to that blatant lies about how easy it would be and about what both the status quo and the future meant. A lot of voters bought into snake oil peddled by people now trying to distance themselves from the whole shoddy affair.

@JustinTrudeau Trump says we're a threat to US national security. Canada sits btwn Russia & USA  Trump now =Treason  We have water & oil. Altogether = clear & nearly present danger. Your response?

5976 2018-07-17 12:58:57 Funny how we can afford to continuously go to war, bailout banks, subsidize oil and no one asks how those are funded. Yet the second you want to make public universities tuition free it will somehow bankrupt the nation?

5998 2018-07-17 12:56:09 Like the rest of the European Union, Germany relies on Russian exports as its main supply of gas and crude oil. Natural gas is the fuel where Germany’s proportion of imports from Russia is highest: it’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal.

6004 2018-07-17 12:55:58 Absurd comparison. Not only did FDR initiate conflict with his oil embargo, but Putin didn't kill 2000 American soldiers. There is no comparison.
6005 2018-07-17 12:55:50 Not a good analysis...

The author argues that the sanctions will not be effectual as the oil sell reduction is picked up by oil price rise! He continues to allege that the Regime’s collapse bring about instability. He doesn’t explain why and ignores the contributors otherwise.

6015 2018-07-17 12:54:45 Obama did no such thing. Do you just invent this nonsense? As for turning countries into rubble for oil, that was the Republicans under Bush-Cheney. I will not defend ANY Republican administration esp the current Trump-Pence one. Putin a choirboy? Maybe in the Church of Satan.

6029 2018-07-17 12:52:53 It's because of a pest that eats the chorophyll. Just use neem oil mixed with water and a little soap for 15 days once in two days. Drench the leaves well.

6043 2018-07-17 12:50:55 Berman was hired initially at the request of some oil companies. Think of it as "inviting an enemy for dinner." Why is it bad to get an alternative point of view? Smart companies (& politicians) do that sort of thing. Politicians trying to put out a tire fire deflect.

6046 2018-07-17 12:50:27 ugh it's so annoying honestly i read somewhere to avoid sweat, oil and heat and use tea tree oil, witch hazel or aloe vers but idk i'm too scared to try it out

6055 2018-07-17 12:49:29 THEY do—geography, and oil/gas. As to the Russia trade, USA, not so much.

(I had forgotten their grain exports, but those don’t come here: RU is too far away, and those transport costs are too high.)
6056 2018-07-17 12:49:22 En Argentina está la muestra...Macri elimino el control cambiario impuesto por Kirschner y la inflación no ha retrocedido un céntimo, como tampoco ha frenado la especulación del dólar, en el caso particular de ellos, el llamado dólar blue.

6061 2018-07-17 12:48:39 Let's pour effluent into the NS waters, a lot of effluent, and then drill for oil in the NS waters, and do it without safety equipment. 

Or lets get rid of this government, grow a spine and demand sanity in ofice.
6062 2018-07-17 12:48:32 Brown isn't just bad on oil drilling, cap-and-trade & the #DeltaTunnels. His policies on environmental justice and Tribal water and gathering rights are horrendous. He has presided over the collapse of salmon, #Deltasmelt & other fish populations. He's owned by #BigAg & #BigOil.

6067 2018-07-17 12:48:19 Kenya's trade deficit hit 500B this month. We are creating jobs in other countries.  So when I see our MPs politicking day in day out instead of burning midnight oil to figure out ways of revamping our manufacturing sector and other sectors of our economy,  I get mad, really mad.
6068 2018-07-17 12:48:16 @MorningsMaria Lets not distract people from the hypocritical policies of prior administrations \, eg building a pipeline to bring oil and gas from Russia to Europe. doesn't make sense if they are this big enemy.  what a joke!

6095 2018-07-17 12:45:56 US delegation will talk to India to purchase oil from US with sanctions going into place. Iran in total, exporting roughly 2.2 million barrels day of sales, which half going to China and India-. It’s very important for US to get India on board with sanctions policy.

6105 2018-07-17 12:45:18 They are not afraid of their owners, they are afraid of their advertisers. They are beholden to the Corporate Culture and wouldn't dare challenge it but reporting something that the Banks and Oil companies wouldn't like.
6106 2018-07-17 12:45:12 He talks nice about Putin it's true, but he's been hard on Russia with sanctions and spoke openly about our allies becoming dependent on Russian Oil! Very Frank! I bet the Intelligence briefing he received from Putin was designed to scare the hell out of him!
6107 2018-07-17 12:45:05 Because unlike fake Russian phobia you should focus on real problems and lets not forget that is Americans who run around the world killing millions of people over lies and oil not Russian and also overthrowing governments left and right again Americans not Russia
6108 2018-07-17 12:45:03 Why is Germany making oil deals w/ Russia? Why is the EU profiting from  trade with Iran? It seems our allies are embracing our adversaries.    

Why is no one talking about China? Stealing our technology, buying our  assets and spying on our government, companies & universities.

6112 2018-07-17 12:44:41 Re oil, the north sea is one of the hardest places in world to extract it hence high production costs which in turn effect the profit margins, which is where we get a cut. If no tax breaks it would be difficult to support ongoing production for no profit
6113 2018-07-17 12:44:37 Having a great skin day. Rosehip oil got my skin looking superb.
6114 2018-07-17 12:44:21 Aquí el hábito contralor no existe. La contraloría es el deber ser jamás cumplido. Yo diría que si fracasó el método, fracasó la idea por su mala ejecución. Distinto a decir "la idea es inútil", porque con su debida ejecución, habría dado buenos resultados el control cambiario.

6123 2018-07-17 12:42:56 Linda - your party advocates for the destruction of the Alberta oil industry while looking the other way as we import oil from the most misogynist and repressive regimes on earth.... I guess as long as the oil isn’t from an Alberta pipeline it’s all good.
6124 2018-07-17 12:42:51 Now think about how much oil and gas was used to make these wind turbines and then deliver them to their final destination.

6126 2018-07-17 12:42:40 Nazi pilots could see us however, and were having good results. Our plane took several 20mm shells from the MEs, #2 started running rough but the oil level held so I just throttled it back and pushed the other three to stay in formation.

6129 2018-07-17 12:42:26 We need Russian help (or at least non-interference) on several other issues: Syria (we are morally locked into not dealing w Syria even though it is kicking ISIS's ass), Iran (we need to isolate Iran, not have it gain a friend in Russia) & NK (Russia could block oil exports to)

6132 2018-07-17 12:42:19 If anyone cannot see that Trump has postured for #AmericaFirst by upping oil export and threatening Russia’s $11B contract with Germany in order to produce favorable results is short sighted. As usual, they hang on his words and not actions. #MAGA
6133 2018-07-17 12:42:16 Russia has long backed mullahs in Iran vut days before summit announced they'd increase oil production to offset losses in world supply from kess Irabiab oil being exported. Trump got them to abandon muiiahs

Not a threat. NATO useless. Russia helped defeat isis in Syria, defended against Ukraine & Iran pipe sabotage
6147 2018-07-17 12:40:47 For my hair. Most products are too light or just straight oil. I need something to weigh the fro down
6148 2018-07-17 12:40:45 No, you're not stingy when you refuse to do free job for someone. You've not gone to the market and one woman gives you free tuber of yam or oil. Your landlord has not waved a year rent for you, internet has never been free.

6175 2018-07-17 12:35:53 I repeat: "Iran/Iraq war, Kuwait conflict, US/Iraq, hell the entire quagmire in the middle east since 1953 can to some degree be traced back to western oil interests, starting with BP and Mossadegh"

You need to brush up on recent history.

6178 2018-07-17 12:35:15 Isn't this the same guy that said Germany should buy their oil from us, instead of Russia? If Germany did so, then it would damage the Russian economy.

6182 2018-07-17 12:34:59 Leaving aside all the financial analysis, Gist for Common Man is that Oil Companies Review Prices in 15 Days but Retail Prices are Changed Everyday to Conceal Rising Prices from Unsuspecting Public to make Huge Profits. #Opaqueness

6194 2018-07-17 12:32:42 Normally when I’m in a waiting room with a book, I don’t get disturbed but the guy wanting to complain about his car’s oil issues doesn’t care.

Please talk my ear off, my good man.
Your oil woes are captivating!
6195 2018-07-17 12:32:35 Probably the same guy on talk radio this morning, fat makes you fat was the mantra, however the amount of saturated fat in things like coconut oil worries me, yes losing weight but long term health ? Confused
6196 2018-07-17 12:32:29 Best decision I ever made was to study Marketing and to actually become certified. I realise how little I know and that you absolutely must have the fundamentals down if you want to actually succeed. Not just make money, any old snake oil salesman can do that.

Maybe look up some remedies with tumeric. It’s a natural lightener.
6200 2018-07-17 12:31:18 Yes and if you look back at every level since 28 in 2016 I was bullish Oil, and people were talking of 25, the time was not right. Now it is possible if at all. Of course we review at each stage but this high is the high for the year at least

6240 2018-07-17 12:24:54 How so? I could have sworn at the G7 he said Germany shouldn't get oil from Russia and I could have sworn that the U S. Is now the number one oil producer in the world and oil is all Russia has?
6241 2018-07-17 12:24:53 I gotta say, this is some class level gaslighting. Which fumes did you use? Russian crude oil, grade 45?  Or what brand of glue do you sniff?

6246 2018-07-17 12:24:09 This is ridiculous going to the largest oil producers for investment and then tax paying citizens that are already in pinch must be happy with high petrol prices
6247 2018-07-17 12:24:02 Of course because someone loyal to the Kremlin would tell England to stop buying #Russian oil and to stop pumping billions into the Russian economy - yea that’s a pro Russian advocate would say #wakeuo
6248 2018-07-17 12:23:52 Winning today as I leap from the chair, slap a tenner on the counter and flee the Turkish barber before he can, unbidden, slather the 'special oil' around my features that triggers welts and blisters for 2 weeks solid....

6261 2018-07-17 12:22:40 07:36 AM EDT, 07/17/2018 (MT Newswires) -- Goldman Sachs said it still expects a deficit in crude supplies as global crude inventories are low and oil demand remains robust, supporting its Brent prices forecast of a $70 to $80 a barrel range amid increased volatility.

6300 2018-07-17 12:17:26 Russia is a regional power.
World's largest country but provides less than 3% of global GNP.
Does not produce anything the world markets demand, besides oil & gas.
One of the most corrupt countries in the world.
25% of Russian men die before 55, most deaths related to alcohol.

@wmarybeard is not only fiercely smart, she has a lovely face, is a friendly presence on screen - and has an ace offbeat TV wardrobe.
6303 2018-07-17 12:16:46 Again it’s your opinion and mine too but facts and statistics proves otherwise. Libya under Gaddafi was becoming a first world, oil hitting over $200/barrel, african single currency was the subtopic in African heads of state, free education, safe water for his people it was great
6304 2018-07-17 12:16:36 Yes, exactly!  Good deals like buying cheaper military equipment from the Russians for our troops; pay handsomely for Russian snow and ice; then propose to build an oil pipe line directly from Russia to DC?

6307 2018-07-17 12:16:15 No way dude.  Roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Little black burned pieces are bonus.
6308 2018-07-17 12:16:11 Apparently, the art of the deal is capitulate to anyone with oil, unless it's predominantly brown people, in which case, you just kill them and steal it. (Even if you can't burn the fossil fuel. Poor Russia.)

6509 2018-07-17 11:50:53 For headaches, a blend of bergamot, lavender, and rose is helpful. Mix 5 drops bergamot, 3 drops lavender, 2 drops rose into water in a spray bottle.

Then when someone tries to sell you oil, spray them with it.
6510 2018-07-17 11:50:50 I think it’s because I tend to buy new potatoes in summer, and I prefer really ancient ones for roasties. But yes, point taken. And butter-flavoured rapeseed oil!!!!!

6515 2018-07-17 11:49:35 Yeah I was just being sarcastic with the green comment!  and wouldn’t used motor oil be like... in every abandoned vehicle? I think a lot of people don’t realise it’s potential as fuel.

6522 2018-07-17 11:48:27 I'm really considering buying a Subaru and from what I learned to keep the thing alive forever I must:

- Use an Air Oil Seprreator to avoid detonation
- Run the cleanest 93 Premium Gas I can get
- Head gaskets and Timing belt every 90-100k miles
- Oil change every 3k miles
6523 2018-07-17 11:48:06 4 menit pake oil cleanser, 2 menit pake face wash, 4 menit bilas (2 menit air anget, 2 menit air dingin). Sumpah mantep bgt asliiiii itu kulit berasa alus kaya lantai musolah
6524 2018-07-17 11:47:59 I know your life can’t function without paying the oil companies for permission to move, but some of us are happy to move about without their say so. 

The fact that you are getting gouged isn’t a reason for me to be.
6525 2018-07-17 11:47:51 4 minutes cleansing ur face with cleansing oil (baby oil or olive oil will do), 2 minutes cleansing with facial wash,  2 minutes washing ur face with warm water, and end it with washing ur face again with cold water for 2 minutes!
6526 2018-07-17 11:47:51 I support the Turkanas.. No drop of oil should leave their land without a clear framework for sharing revenue. Tullow can withdraw if they want after all most of the profits are going to them and not Kenyans

6529 2018-07-17 11:47:38 Agreed. But I don’t see what precludes women from these fields. To look at oil as an example, most rigs work on a 4 week rotation meaning 4 weeks at sea, 4 home. This puts a lot of people off as it means a lot of time away from family. Aviation is a really inclusive field.
6530 2018-07-17 11:47:35 The effect of low oil prices?

6537 2018-07-17 11:46:42 Halve(length wise or it’s a fucking mess) toss in olive oil, s&p, oven 425 for 20 minutes to cook/caramelize, toss them in a mixture of honey and balsamic. They come out tangy and sweet. Warning though they’re good and will have you ripping some serious ass,like room clearing. GL
6538 2018-07-17 11:46:37 Mr. Kenyatta was warned against launching this oil without drawing valuable lessons from across Africa but boy was on his thirty fourth tot of a pricey whiskey for the day,now Turkana will surely be a statistic!

6548 2018-07-17 11:45:29 Pres.Trump's ACTIONS are what Cotton listed.THAT is what's important.Trump called out Merkel for aiding/abetting Russia's economy in getting oil/gas from Russia while expecting us to protect them from Russia. Trump's request of Merkyl to  stop this would cripple Russia's economy.
6549 2018-07-17 11:45:28 Also OPEC reduced production in order to raise oil prices, as their economies rely mainly on oil
6550 2018-07-17 11:45:24 Any comments on trump trying to steal Russia’s Germany oil business while publicly praising Putin?
6551 2018-07-17 11:45:20 Sorry to butt in, but that's rubbish.

Our area is within 20 miles of oil refineries and you have to go much further to reach the likes of Bradford etc in the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Fuel prices in the East Riding are indefensible and like Victor pointed out..pure profiteering

6597 2018-07-17 11:39:52 If Trump really wants to to contain Putins ambition he needs to make deals to sell EU countries oil and LNG at bargain rates and kill Russian economy Then negotiate
6598 2018-07-17 11:39:46 Its unusual, but it does make sense when analyzed.  Although the main factor behind the price of oil is the value of the dollar, there are also supply & demand factors, etc.  I never said a stronger USD is bullish oil.  I said oil has been ignoring the recent rise in the dollar.
6599 2018-07-17 11:39:45 NO. Not during the ice age. NOW with modern times we have helped in making our planet go through increase in changing the climate.

Is it when he confronted them in Syria

was it when he wanted Germany to buy our oil & gas

6632 2018-07-17 11:36:08 Oil is always going to be pulled from the ground. Would you rather have it shipped in the safest way possible or continue running trucks down the road and trains on the rails? Canada has the stiffest safety laws in the world when it comes to pipeline inspections.
6633 2018-07-17 11:35:56 Space x and NASA are selling snake oil. We are not on a ball spinning at 1000 mph.
6634 2018-07-17 11:35:46 That makes no sense. On one hand you contend a weaker USD is bullish oil & on the other a stronger USD is bullish oil.  You can't have it both ways. lol  Point is sometimes they move together & sometimes they move opposite.. so a weaker USD does not always = higher oil prices

6698 2018-07-17 11:27:08 I think there's arguments for and against personally.

For me, I think that sub-divisions or classes of E-Racers is more than welcomed. But outright getting rid of that fantastic smell of fuel, oil and anti-lag significantly takes away from the spectacle.
6699 2018-07-17 11:27:02 Well, the funny thing is, them both moving up together the past few months even strengthens the argument for higher oil prices.  Not the reverse.

Oil will move much higher once down move resumes in $DXY.  The trade got too crowded, so $DXY went back up from 88 --> 95

6787 2018-07-17 11:12:34 Yep Merkel is really standing up to Russia by signing a 10 billion dollar deal for a pipeline to buy Russian oil. I guess the 1.5 million cave dweller immigrants she let walk into Germany need that Russian oil. Don’t you love watching Germany destroy itself again ??

6827 2018-07-17 11:04:39 Oil has a well-established pattern of moving in trading bands. The first trading band starts with the strong support level near $43 and resistance near $54. This makes the trading band around $11 wide. Applying same trade band projection methods gives long-term target near $76.

6876 2018-07-17 10:56:14 Hi, John. This single graphic, IMO, clearly explains why the #1 largest consuming nation in the world can NEVER be free of the need to import oil from foreign sources.

6878 2018-07-17 10:55:24 Yes, the facts are that Canadians use a lot of oil - that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. Change is needed. Our government should lead the way to change and promote better cleaner tech. Not green-wash and then turn back.

6951 2018-07-17 10:44:47 Have you asked @theresa_may and @PresidentOfNG why the government sponsored genocide in Nigeria?
Harold Wilson killed over 5 million Biafrans to confiscate the Biafran wealth (OIL AND GAS). You want to kill 10m to retain the bloody wealth.

6963 2018-07-17 10:42:35 Zero chance the muricans will cooperate with Russia to prop up oil and gas prices.

6997 2018-07-17 10:36:23 Fair enough. 
In case you did not know before now, there was a recession,which resulted mostly from oil price clash, and partly from poor reserves, so there's bound to be economic hardship. 
We've exited the recession and things are looking up.
It is good enough reaason though.

7020 2018-07-17 10:31:26 When The Rock cracks the oil leaks out. The fact that the oil is still found in pressures up to 22,000 pounds per square inch teaches us that it's less then 10000 years trapped. I found Universal agreement on this. This information is available online.

7053 2018-07-17 10:26:02 soon will see the trump-putin meeting results in europe and syria ... so  for i am selling eu to parity and ill move from oil shorter to dip  buyer
7054 2018-07-17 10:26:01 That would make for an interesting forecast. 70% humidity with a chance of melting coconut oil. 
7055 2018-07-17 10:25:52 Any tips / experience with #cbdoil and anxiety? I’ll start micro dosing soon. I’m just waiting for my 10ml 250mg oil to arrive... #CBD
7056 2018-07-17 10:25:51 Must be the Hemp oil Electra. Sometime oils can give off different smells when cooked. I use Rapeseed oil with red palm fruit when cooking it can smell a bit fishy when heated for too long. 

Try the same dish with a different oil if you can. See if the flavours taste better.
7057 2018-07-17 10:25:39 And Germany didn't have oil revenue
7058 2018-07-17 10:25:39 If a pizza (hopefully a Margherita) is properly made, you can dip the crust in the mixture of milk, tomato and oil. Trust me I live in Naples.

7064 2018-07-17 10:24:38 Obama that eroded the American values and sponsored terrorists didn't. Britain that murdered over 5 million Biafrans just to confiscate the Biafran wealth (OIL AND GAS) didn't. The Dems that have recently turned terrorists didn't. It's me dt spoke out.

7065 2018-07-17 10:24:24 To my earlier post accepting Russia has its own interests I am not arguing that other countries shouldn't try to foil them. The world is a better place for a counter to the west's oligarchic interests aka the oil companies. This CW rhetoric does zero for human rights in Russia.

7069 2018-07-17 10:22:36 I love my local mechanic. He’s like the best kind of parental figure. ‘Don’t drive your car with its oil warning light on’, he advised, with a dramatic and serious expression. I have decided to listen to him.

7087 2018-07-17 10:19:39 All of our favorite products get “adjusted / improved” by manufacturers when they need to shave costs. Substitute butter with palm oil & increase sugar content, reduce pack size, and keep the bucks rolling in. Eet sum more - those were the business back in the day!!

7320 2018-07-17 09:41:19 Higher oil prices do help
7321 2018-07-17 09:41:08 We’ve made steady progress with diversification of the economy (creation of new sectors and markets). Where we’re stuck is diversifying exports (more products, higher complexity), a failure of govt & private sector alike, and diversification of govt revenue from oil
7322 2018-07-17 09:40:53 Haha weep Olive oil. There's first time for anything
7323 2018-07-17 09:40:51 @realDonaldTrump We and the people who want to destroy terrorism are a sound, and we say that by November, Iran's oil should reach zero, not a word less, not a single word.
7324 2018-07-17 09:40:50 A statue weeping olive oil?
7325 2018-07-17 09:40:43 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
7326 2018-07-17 09:40:43 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7328 2018-07-17 09:40:22 @realDonaldTrump Exemption from sanctions means betraying the Iranian people and we will never tolerate such a thing. At no point will we allow anyone to be exempted from the oil embargo. Israel should not interfere in US politics because it will have difficult consequences

7332 2018-07-17 09:40:00 I take it that after 2030 oil supplies will be touch and go, & prices should exceed $120 per barrel in 2018 dollars @gulf_intel @El_Spy
7333 2018-07-17 09:39:59 @narendramodi Modi ji I have requested so many times to every department but no action has been take. My request it if you monitor the oil, cement and others materials consumption by CBI u can save 40% of the budget in Army. 91 RCC, 127 RCC etc..
7334 2018-07-17 09:39:49 @realDonaldTrump India, China, or any other country from November 4 to buy oil from Iran, will face the most severe sanctions and will lose America's markets, do not mind, there are no exemptions.
7335 2018-07-17 09:39:34 Cbd oil works wonders for my chronic pain. It’s better than downing myself in strong pain killers that end up giving you kidney/liver damage over time just saying. There are some people who abuse it but people who use it for medical reasons, just wanna live a better life

7342 2018-07-17 09:39:06 You goal of obtaining to be a RUSSIAN OLIGARCH has been elevated.  Deliver in putting Russian oil commodities back as viable.  CYBER WAR TREASONOUS!

7345 2018-07-17 09:38:33 @realDonaldTrump The oil boycott will be carried out according to the plan, and by November Iran's oil exports will reach zero, and people are on our way along the way.

And do you think Trump earned a commission in Russia? Saudi, Russia, all OPEC is getting rich since he cut Iran nuke deal and oil prices spiked

7353 2018-07-17 09:37:16 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts pumpkin seed oil with 1 part red wine vinegar and 1 part mayonnaise. Add bacon and jam to taste.
7354 2018-07-17 09:37:08 I think he is deeply corrupt and hopes to profit from the chaos he is creating as well as from future deals with the Russians.  He has already received big loans for projects from Russians.  No doubt the big oil, coal and chemical companies will be generous too.

7367 2018-07-17 09:35:00 @NigeriaNRC Osten Olorunsola is making a brilliant presentation of the Global Prospects for the Nigerian Economy. NIGERIA has to learn to use 'our oil to get out of oil' We have to really diversify, but no real political present & historical will to do so. Why?
7368 2018-07-17 09:34:54 Fresh out of the shower, oil.

7372 2018-07-17 09:33:10 HPCL, BPCL and IOC charts are so similar to Crude Oil charts which means investors / Traders are thinking our petrol prices are dependent on daily Volatility of Crude prices which is not the case at all.

7373 2018-07-17 09:33:09 Nigeria is not as oil rich as it considers itself in terms of per capita. Other oil producing countries are far ahead of Nigeria #PassAllPIBsNow

7375 2018-07-17 09:33:07 You mean American media I suppose? Nowhere else in the world is climate change seriously doubted. The US has oil money and Rupert Murdoch to deal with.
7376 2018-07-17 09:32:46 Perhaps they don’t need to install it if there is no water present in the oil?

7380 2018-07-17 09:32:07 Puzzling isn't the word for it. Treasonous act of a scoundrel and a snake oil salesman out to make money for hisself.

- Ok, it's a good opportunity. And what is Lukoil? 
- Same thing in Russia.

7404 2018-07-17 09:27:15 Great news out on #MSMN 

“Revenue attributable to Mosman was $534,500, a 191% increase over the previous six months reflecting Mosman's further investment into production assets,  increases to production, and oil prices over the comparative period”
7405 2018-07-17 09:27:13 When Presidents Putin and Trump openly talk about maintaining the oil and gas price, is that not the criminal offence of price fixing?  Just asking.
7406 2018-07-17 09:27:13 also many of the “blackheads” on your oil production zones are sebaceous filaments, which provide good oils to your face (as long as you keep your face clean)- using things like pore strips or scraping them out regularly can cause damage and worsen your acne and skin over time
7407 2018-07-17 09:27:08 Rest assured, Trump will do what Putin suggests, not just when it comes to the price of oil

7410 2018-07-17 09:26:25 I believe sovereign debt is not an issue,but fiscal deficit,flight to safety,oil price,net import can very well screw in a short time.
7411 2018-07-17 09:26:24 It's the oil. Never change the oil!
7412 2018-07-17 09:26:22 @channelafrica1 Hursh; President Bashir is motivated by financial gain to improve oil production.

7417 2018-07-17 09:25:26 Food products that use "sustainable" palm oil always specify it in the ingredients, but so many products are actually completely free of palm oil but don't advertise so on the packaging. Such a shame.
7418 2018-07-17 09:25:25 figure out an easy 3-4 step cleanser>toner>moisturizer routine and start there; also play around with how you cleanse morning vs night. for blackheads you want tighter pores, oil/sebum control, and cell turnover so consider AHA/BHA/salicylic acid/retinol/oil cleansers
7419 2018-07-17 09:24:54 You are pleased while Norway oil and gas has hit 1tr, the first ever beating Apple a telecommunication giants. You guys are just wasting the  country  resources, you claim to build refineries till now nothing.

7429 2018-07-17 09:22:15 It was very interesting, but maybe wishful thinking? Trump's position has been, in the past, that his strong preference for low oil prices put him at odds with Moscow. Trump didn't respond to this point from Putin yesterday.

7431 2018-07-17 09:22:05 Both were subjected to disproportionate force that had more to do with destabilising oil trade than liberating oppressed citizens; Iraq on the pretext of WMDs that never existed. No doubt the US intervention was self-serving..
7432 2018-07-17 09:21:54 Es un acto terrorista, cortar cables al ras que no se puedan empalmar. El paramilitarismo colombiano tiene en Venezuela su huella puesta. La derecha apátrida su aliada.

7441 2018-07-17 09:20:39 UK 's £3.2 billion from the Irish bail out is conveniently not mentioned. Keep the Irish oil until this debt is paid. I am sick of the UK being used as a cash cow by everyone and getting nothing but abuse in return

Putin is sweating over no German oil cash. His job

7596 2018-07-17 08:50:11 Hi Mehreen, they should be ok if they're kept in a cool, dark area of the house. If the oil is exposed to direct sunlight the capsules might oxidise. We tend to keep ours in the fridge so if you're worried that might be best.

7617 2018-07-17 08:45:22 Authenticity lost the game when Raleigh or Drake or whoever didn't bring back deep fat fryers with the potato from the Americas. The debate was over before it even began.

That said I sympathise if a favourite ingredient is hard to get on the other side of the butter/o. oil line.

Putin could threaten to tell that they worked together on stacking the election - that’d be enough, now.

7649 2018-07-17 08:39:33 Yes, so his own intelligence people are well known to tell lies, what about the WMD's? The middle East wars have been about nothing else but oil, based on lies. At least now they have an honest President not scared to say what he believes.
7650 2018-07-17 08:39:25 @mektronik This macrovoices was good, especially if you substitute any commodity for oil and consider how much is being stock piled in China. Quote was like moves like this only happen when wars break out unexpectedly. Aligns with lots I hear in China….
7651 2018-07-17 08:39:25 I'm from the spud clan too, and here in Sardinia they call it patata purée. This though still confuses me as they use olive oil instead of butter. Authenticity is a must for the origin of the humble spud of life.

7655 2018-07-17 08:38:50 Here’s my question - trump accused Germany of being a captive to Russia because of oil, but also stated that to build a brighter future, they (US
and Russia) must get along.

So in his head, Germany trading with Russia should be good.

Unless money is involved?
7656 2018-07-17 08:38:33 Please, look at the materials needed for battery production (Tesla's I mean), mining industry still has a great potential for something other than coal or oil.

7658 2018-07-17 08:38:01 Well...thats yet to be establish.. if they were wise enough..  since we got oil now.. let the government task this oil companies to build us what we need and they will cost it up and gradually takes it out from the oil revenue. Rather than giving us cash which may be squandered.
7659 2018-07-17 08:37:42 That’s oil royalty talking. Nothing to do with religion
7660 2018-07-17 08:37:37 There was a report years ago that got buried. About shady offshore companies that trade in our oil owned by Royals and other rich elite. iScotland needs to trade our oil through our own commodities exchange!

"UK oil and gas production up for fifth year in a row"

Delete 'UK'. Insert 'Scotland's'.
7664 2018-07-17 08:36:41 I suggest you properly clean out that oil cooler. Drain (blow?) out the oil in the cooler then fill it with petrol (dangerous) or paraffin (takes longer to work) and let it soak for a day then blow through. May still not clear all the passages. New cooler is best.
7665 2018-07-17 08:36:36 I trust Putin to try to harm Donald Trump. Stop oil purchases by Germany from Russia. We give money to Germany to buy oil to support K G B operations like the Hungarian K G B agent in the USA

7729 2018-07-17 08:23:03 i mean ... all these stats are going down, because we already fucked up. but as far as I can tell it wasn't a choice between "energy and power now" and "don't have a hellworld in the future", the sacrifice too far was "oil execs make less money"
7730 2018-07-17 08:22:46 The clearing mud is the only one I’ve tried, I got a sample size with an order and was DAMN SOLD on it. It does an amazing job of sucking the oil and gunk out of your pores... I think the price is worth it when you only need to use it 1-2 times a week

7734 2018-07-17 08:22:06 You want to over simplify the point , as Mr Salmond did , into just working out the difference between dividing the oil revs between 5.3 million instead of 67 million.

Kalau wajah mulai bersih bisa dikurangi menjadi satu kali.

Sunscreen dan makeup harus dibersihkan dengan mc/mw/cleansing oil alias harus double cleansing step.

7764 2018-07-17 08:14:30 I am not arguing the UK is unique in that way.. but consider Venezuela produces well over twice as much oil as the UK but it has got into trouble despite that.

They did it all in the name of going after Saddam Hussein in reality they were the oil.

7836 2018-07-17 07:58:41 Gas prices are still extremely low in red states with low/no gas tax. I paid $2.29 today in South Carolina. Also, since we now the world's largest oil producer higher gas prices is not a drag, unless they get so high it affects productivity.
7837 2018-07-17 07:58:36 Interesting. So I should compare Nigeria’s return with IOCs and not other oil producing countries? So ADNOC and Statoil don’t reinvest in CAPEX on annual basis? I had no idea govt take in JV is 85-96% please explain how this is so.....thanks.
7838 2018-07-17 07:58:30 Uh like a wart?? Try a 1:2 mixture of tea tree oil and olive oil. Cover the spot with the mixture every 30 minutes throughout the day. Within a few days it should disappear
7839 2018-07-17 07:58:03 Actually, there were fuel hikes during Zuma’s presidency, but not as frequent. Also, Ramaphosa explained that because we do not produce oil, we are “price takers” of those who do. I’m not justifying his position, but these problems-any political problems-rarely begin overnight
7840 2018-07-17 07:57:54 As I’m getting older I’m realizing I really can’t eat like I did as a kid/teenager

7841 2018-07-17 07:57:38 #thedrum Is not #trump trying to lower the oil price?
Will he not get back home and announce lowering of sanctions on Russian oil and doing #Putin a favour in the process. Lower oil prices might lift the US economy also.

8086 2018-07-17 07:13:53 You're right! Part of the unbeatable cost is thanks to its incredibly high yield compared to other oil crops, the other probably due to its non-transparent supply chain. Should consumers demand segregated oil to ensure its sustainability or would that harm the weakest farmers?

8267 2018-07-17 06:35:37 Going to try out CBD oil to see if it helps me more with anxiety than the regular thc oils.
8268 2018-07-17 06:35:35 I only wish he had abandoned that GD oil patch. He is building you a F ing pipeline with all Canadians money so you can sell your dirty bitumen and leak all over the environment and set off wildfires across North America. I wish he would tell you to leave it in the ground.
8269 2018-07-17 06:35:28 The man who increased it is in Nkandla. He messed up our oil reserves due to his poor leadership. You didn't even pay your maid R3500.
8270 2018-07-17 06:35:03 I've never heard of an African country going to Europe & drilling for oil, or London for minerals...

Decolonising the Mind.
8271 2018-07-17 06:35:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
8272 2018-07-17 06:34:41 Well done Sherlock, we are in business and hopefully topped up at the right time yesterday like they topped up on the oil yesterday, now me being Sherlock it won’t be too long for the tankers as they are on tank three or five now good new hopefully 
8273 2018-07-17 06:34:35 I love how soft baby oil makes my skin 
8274 2018-07-17 06:34:29 The oil companies control everything. Like there’s this guy who invented this car that runs on water man
8275 2018-07-17 06:34:14 @Hyundai what’s the point of buying a brand new car and having the manufacturer tells you to let it get worse before they work an oil consuming engine 1.5qts/1000miles at least. I’ll never buy from them again at this rate
8276 2018-07-17 06:33:58 If oil is made from dinosaur fossils, and plastic is made from oil......then plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.

8281 2018-07-17 06:32:59 @BBCScotlandNews "oil and gas production has increased for the 5th year in a row, however it was revealed that exploration is at it lowest level since the 1970s"!
heaven help me!
what do you do when you've found something @BBC?
YOU STOP FUCKING LOOKING!
8282 2018-07-17 06:32:58 Just in case they fill all 5 tanks, they have two humongous green tanks, oversize load when empty. I think they hold the equivalent of 3+ road tankers each........ And there is another humongous bunded tank near the viewing platform..... Is that for oil or rainwater

8284 2018-07-17 06:32:13 Apparently the colonialist news service is saying oil production is good this morning
8285 2018-07-17 06:32:05 What about every single component of it being made of oil production?

8289 2018-07-17 06:31:40 While I’m thankful for the few homegrown establishments that make Bataan’s humble food scene, they really gotta go easy on the oil.
8290 2018-07-17 06:31:29 It is also treason that EU countries don’t pay 2% into NATO and treason that Germany imports 70% of its oil from Russia. Now Trump is on a difficult tight rope to work with Russia where possible!

8297 2018-07-17 06:29:21 Ummmm Kenney wants the tax to remain on large emitters (I think oil companies would qualify); not unlike they’ve had since 2007 I believe. And since they weren’t hit with a carbon tax due to the fact they already had one... six of one and a half dozen of the other?

8304 2018-07-17 06:27:29 My brother had one. My bike had seized and needed repair. Fell off it as pillion on a slow bend as the clutch push rod seal went and there was oil on the tyre. On the way back from a family party in Orpington to Whitchurch in the evening the battery went and lighting failed!
8305 2018-07-17 06:27:24 “Pfft, the only difference for us is that I'm made out of flesh and bone and you're metal and gears.

Now come on!”

Grabs a her hand~! To the oil again and to get a basket to hold them.

8316 2018-07-17 06:23:48 Continuing to burn high sulphur heavy fuel oil will save operators $10+M's post 2020. This is opening the door for low cost emulsion fuels which burn cleaner and reduce scrubber waste. Quadrise fuels has already had its MSAR emulsion succesfully trialled by Maersk and Wartsilla

Is that, y'know... legal?

8323 2018-07-17 06:21:32 Nick you look young. Probably too young to remmber when "science" told us we'd run out of oil by 2000, or that smoking filtered cigarettes were safe.

Blindly believing in "science" of the day, espeically politicized science is a fool's errand.

For curls or volume use a curler .

8393 2018-07-17 06:10:13 I have an electric car charged with clean energy.  Take a test drive some time.  They have a lot of advantages, including not buying foreign oil.  The energy I use for my house and car is all made in America.
8394 2018-07-17 06:10:09 because the majority of plastic doesn’t get recycled dumbass. it gets thrown into the ocean just like all other trash. and who lives in the ocean? “at least animals aren’t getting hurt,” well baby girl they still are! I dont get how you don’t understand it. oil products in water?
8395 2018-07-17 06:09:57 If you shower before bed, lavender (oil or actual lavender flowers) in the shower helps as well, and lavender shampoo will calm you too.
8396 2018-07-17 06:09:55 When jake says "gimme 10 min" I know I have enough time to mow the lawn, change my oil, watch every fast and furious movie, and take a nap before he's ready
8397 2018-07-17 06:09:39 Listen to me carefully. I am from Bulgaria. We had been under Russian oppression for 45 years after WWII. They continue to meddle with our politics (money, oil, blackmail). They are EVIL. Not Mexico, not EU, not Canada. RUSSIA! And your president is their puppet.
8398 2018-07-17 06:09:39 “Oh. . .

You don't have pants either.

Huh.

Well, let's get you some of all of that!”

8405 2018-07-17 06:08:06 They only smeared black oil on the sign boards,but in same Kerala killing of BJP workers by PFI and the Commies is an everyday affair yet you never got time to condemn it instead Pappu was hobnobbing with SDPI Karnataka a political wing of radical Islamist PFI. Really Shameful.
8406 2018-07-17 06:08:01 Dear @WeAreZizzi 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
8407 2018-07-17 06:07:29 Won't suggest because coconut oil has a very strong aroma. Use any oil that has very less or no aroma. You can use peanut oil.
8408 2018-07-17 06:07:20 Just make sure you marinate the meat over night in olive oil, herbs, spices etc, n never do ribs on bbq, oven only, Delia recipe my fav!

8416 2018-07-17 06:06:38 No, The Iran Deal made the world safer. Trump opened the door to Iran developing Nuclear Weapons AGAIN. They were compliant under The Iran Deal. This is all about the oil. NOTHING ELSE.  Trump screwed the world over oil.

8499 2018-07-17 05:49:27 2015 was supposed to be the end of the credit cycle. Poloz panic due to oil, reduced rates and created a blow off top in credit. China's last big credit impulse was also in 2015. 2018, the reverse is happening. The cycle was artificially extended. Time to pay the piper.

8541 2018-07-17 05:42:47 Oil futures in NY fell 4.2 percent on Monday following last Wednesday’s 5% tumble. The latest decline comes as Saudi Arabia is offering more crude cargoes to Asian customers.

He'll get Trump to sell US assets cheaply to Russian & GOP pals (oil, gas, timber, aluminum, mining rights, natural resources). New owners will strip the industries blind and stow their money offshore. Trump & Putin get a very big cut.

8643 2018-07-17 05:25:24 - exfoliate your lips. mix sugar with a little bit of coconut oil and scrub on your lips. it gets rid of any dry skin on your lips and makes them smooth. 
- drink lots of water. drinking water has lots of positive benifits, and soft lips is one of them.
8644 2018-07-17 05:25:14 I unfortunately doubt that peak oil is going to save the climate. Up to today, all global peak-oil estimates were wrong. Even Hubberts initial correct assessment of the US peak in oil production is outdated today due to shale oil. Extraction technology is evolving fast.

8661 2018-07-17 05:21:56 I'm sort of with you on the premise but you might want to choose a different example. Technically we were. They had annexed the Philippines in an oil grab. Pearl Harbor directly attacked our citizens though.
8662 2018-07-17 05:21:52 Ooooh, thank you, I hadn't seen that before. I'm interested by her focus on oil. Someone tweeted earlier today that they don't think the Russians have any blackmail on Trump, that this is all about money and Trump wanting the adoration that Putin pretends to have for him.
8663 2018-07-17 05:21:49 Alberta.that gas station with her tax free oil industry ,all her services paid by the federal gvt.Shooting Indians left and right.telling me im living on their check....

8665 2018-07-17 05:21:38 @seanhannity Is nothing more than an unscrupulous opportunistic fear mongering snake oil salesman. Wait until his great grandchildren read about him aghast with horror & shame. Who would want to aspire to be a treasonous dictator's mouth piece who believes everyone is subhuman?
8666 2018-07-17 05:21:26 Apparently not, I like the black pepper olive oil triscuits.

8680 2018-07-17 05:19:13 Would you go to the bakery to get the oil changed in your car?  Of course you wouldn’t.  You shouldn’t go to a website that sells advertising for banking institutions and expect a correct credit report and score either.  Only the big 3 bureaus or a mortgage partner can help you.
8681 2018-07-17 05:18:56 Finally now that you have the ANMR oil you show some gumption against GOP ‘s treasonous @realDonaldTrump

8690 2018-07-17 05:17:41 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
8691 2018-07-17 05:17:32 I might start making CBD and Hemp Oil bathbombs, soaps, and maybe even shampoo bars. I might start making jewelry too. Oh, the possibilities are endless.

8693 2018-07-17 05:17:18 Heat application, daily stretching routine, cbd oil, and sleeping on a hard surface.
8694 2018-07-17 05:17:00 Defend what - our meddled in foreign elections? Lapses in US intelligence & FBI investigations? Trump put up a mirror today and was honest. Putin is thug and liar but outside Nukes & oil is a minor player. Take focus off of Nuke war and on economic war with China. Putin can help.
8695 2018-07-17 05:16:58 Apparently it was a whole field of oil seed rape at Old Newton. @SuffolkFire told the landowner it was probably started by a cigarette thrown out of a car 
8696 2018-07-17 05:16:42 The crisis is climate change caused by the oil patch. The boarder is a snooze.
8697 2018-07-17 05:16:41 Selling snake oil to desperate and/or stupid people is already detestable, but pretending that homeopathy actually works really is a step too far. What is wrong with you? 

Just fleecing all these poor people is not enough?
8698 2018-07-17 05:16:39 You know nothing of history Time and again conservatives burn it down out of spite. Germany shipped Lenin to Russia in an insane bid to win WW1 and Mideast Oil. How many Germans died in the decades following Not dissimilar to Civil War Fire Eaters or Trump voters

8711 2018-07-17 05:15:07 My first thought was that Beer doesn’t mix very well with olive oil 
8712 2018-07-17 05:14:55 Minutes ago, border patrol agents allowed oil drilling in Bernie Sanders, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice. Bad (or sick)!

8719 2018-07-17 05:13:38 Russia is a major oil producer as welll as the largest reserves of gas. Russia has advanced technology in defence and is self sufficient in food. Russia is not 12th but in the top 5. Countries like UK, France are weak economies and have not much energy supply
8720 2018-07-17 05:13:34 Trump's trade war allows Russian soy beans to replace ours in China.  Cancelling the Iran Agreement & re-imposing sanctions increased the price of oil, which helps Russia.  Any questions?
8721 2018-07-17 05:13:27 Love getting hot oil splashed in my eye 
8722 2018-07-17 05:13:23 Watching Trump manhandle oil prices is an absolute thing of beauty. It surprises me that it took America this long to flex its political might on such an important economic resource.
8723 2018-07-17 05:13:15 When can as well sell Turkana oil source.
8724 2018-07-17 05:12:57 @IngrahamAngle  Hey on the subject of the things President Trump would be doing if he was a Russia Spy (Limiting Fracking) ( Block Oil & Gas Pipelines) ( Cut U.S. Military Sending) Reduce Tensions with Iran) but he is not . But he is Building up the Military, .....

8748 2018-07-17 05:09:15 Coal billionaire Tom Steyer’s solar initiative doesn’t address auto pollution, which creates the vast majority of Phoenix pollution. It will kill the PV (clean energy) nuclear plant and result in more pollution from using gas/oil plants to provide power when solar doesn’t/can’t.

8766 2018-07-17 05:06:03 If it was, why did Flynn promised Putin that they were going to reverse the Obama era sanctions once Trump was sworn it. You forget the Obama sanctions affected Russia's oil industry.

8773 2018-07-17 05:04:29 The US still would do that if there were sufficient oil in Africa. There is simply no money to be made for the US. Bombing is never an act of kindness.

8793 2018-07-17 05:01:09 India is today passing through a phase where a great opportunity awaits it. We need, for the next one decade & more, a high trajectory growth.

8807 2018-07-17 04:59:27 my grandma was buying oil at a supplements store and the checkout guy asked her if she had any wisdom to impart (because apparently she looks wise). she advised him not to eat a lot of the vitamins at his store because they could be unsafe. and that’s why she’s my role model

8811 2018-07-17 04:59:10 "Saddam tried to nationalize his oil fields. Didn't he learn from all the dead leaders around the world my dad's CIA killed after they tried to use their resources to help their own people instead of U.S. corporations? Gaddafi tried and Obama and Hillary destroyed his country!"

8814 2018-07-17 04:58:38 wait a minute didn't George bush Sr. defended Saddam Hussein actual war criminal from being invaded in the first gulf war  because he wanted to protect his oil investments in Iraq, wheres the outrage the same thing with the dictator of south Vietnam Ngo Diem and Kennedy

8820 2018-07-17 04:57:46 A survivor at #Swabhimaan2018: We left for work at 6 in the morning and returned at 1 in the night. They gave us only half litre oil and half kg dal for 15 days for the entire family.

8822 2018-07-17 04:57:08 Just curious, if the cannabis used in the cannabis oil hasn't been decarboxylated or heated up to turn the thca into thc would that be considered an oil that will not cause Psychoactive effects

8830 2018-07-17 04:55:29 People are tired of the games played like bashing one another one minute then all huggy kissy the next, like fake..everything..a movie scripted and we're the idiots paying big bucks in the Global audience eating Styrofoam tasting popcorn with oil to see professional liars act.
8831 2018-07-17 04:55:18 Update; Cooked the salmon with fresh dill, tarragon, salt/pepper, butter and olive oil for 15 minutes at 400. Made garlic/olive oil asparagus and rice. Fucking good.

8833 2018-07-17 04:55:10 Hello...its your canola oil bottle. I have a great deal of trouble undoing the cap.. even my hubby couldn't do the last one...had to cut into it with a knife. This happens every time I buy it. I like the oil but if I can't get into it I will have change the product.
8834 2018-07-17 04:54:46 but i add seaweed, sometimes miso if I have, egg, and hot sesame oil.
8835 2018-07-17 04:54:15 Plane air is super dry, ultimately leading to oil build up & breakouts. I’ve  learned a few things to prepare my skin for long flights

Bring moisturizer, face mist, & chapstick. 
Board plane with clean skin/bring wipes.
Hydrate & repeat.

8837 2018-07-17 04:53:38 So do you think the reason the Putin cozy up has to do with oil? The pee pee tape aside. We know he wants a Tower, Spa, and Resort in Moscow.
8838 2018-07-17 04:53:19 That's the face of a snake oil salesmen
8839 2018-07-17 04:53:17 Every time my train goes past the Altona Oil Refinery I wonder if the Trashcan Man would have blown them up like the ones at Gary, Indiana in The Stand
8840 2018-07-17 04:53:16 you guys should add Submarines (Piloted by the Players)to have Sub Wars at sea also Oil rigs as a business giving players the ability to be a Security force or Smuggler pirates stealing data or Setting Bombs to Raise Prices on oil

8844 2018-07-17 04:52:16 High interest rates, oil prices to eat into India’s growth: IMF
-       The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday said the Indian economy will grow slower than what it had estimated just three months ago because of higher crude oil prices and speedier interest rate hikes.
8845 2018-07-17 04:51:54 People don't realize that Russia has the same GDP of New York and except for oil and gas, no industrial economy. It just has nuclear weapons. China is the real threat to America.

8847 2018-07-17 04:51:18 Yep. I believe we should begin an annual awards show— who will host The First Annual Snake Oil Salesperson Awards Show?
8848 2018-07-17 04:51:04 Poland  and Baltic country s should demand  sanctions  that stop putin from setting  price of oil and setting  limit on how much that russian can drill

8855 2018-07-17 04:50:10 Not sure whether you tuned into the Press Conference. Right from the start from set piece deliveries to answering journalists Putin, whatever we might think about him, was coherent & focused, avoiding repetition or talking about himself. Trump came over as snake oil salesman
8856 2018-07-17 04:49:58 my jar of coconut OIL that I had in my shower leaked and my whole bottom of the tub was oiled up and slippery, you can not tell me that wasn’t god personally trying to kill me
8857 2018-07-17 04:49:47 Wet you face with cold water to open your pores then rinse off in hot water to close your pores . Then find a good cleansing soap, also a moisturizer it can be a cream or a oil and then some rose water for toning
8858 2018-07-17 04:49:23 As a Muir. It's time Canada reaps all rewards of oil. I'm in favour of environmental protection. But the money is worth the stain. Anyways no said shit about smoking!!! Killed more Canadians thsn all other diseases. Costs the economy billions a year. Think about it

8861 2018-07-17 04:48:21 Perhaps the “extra” in the video Russia has of Trump is named Rand. Look closely at the grainy picture of the guy wearing a nappy and holding the baby oil!
8862 2018-07-17 04:47:49 peppermint is my favorite essential oil 
8863 2018-07-17 04:47:43 You see a lot of things you can't substantiate. Being an NDP supporter in the 21st century, OTOH, does require a fairly accomplished talent at self-deception.

Kids are against anything they don't understand. But all their iPhones and Segways come from plastic, meaning oil.
8864 2018-07-17 04:47:18 So where are the ecco warriors to protest the oil leaking from the turbine fouling the ground?
8865 2018-07-17 04:47:07 Inside the soccer ball is a stock certificate for 5% stake in Russian oil company Rosneft.  Putin is enjoying this.  Won’t be funny when Russian agents start murdering Americans who criticize Russia on American soil. I think Trump would encourage it!

8868 2018-07-17 04:46:35 Remember as TRump criticized Germany for buying oil from Russia he’s spent the last 18 months trying to reduce OPEC production (which raises oil prices & benefits Trump’s boss Putin/Russia #PutinsPuppets #TrumpRussia #TrumpIsATraitor
8869 2018-07-17 04:46:34 Mr Steins piece is the most inane &  funny shit I have read since being on Twitter. Russia completely wiped out in a few mos..Isis caravans & enclaves with stolen oil that Nato & CIA had provided cover for over a year. That sounds like a very competent & efficient military to me
8870 2018-07-17 04:46:33 Hate running out of oil right before bed. If you got wax tonight let me know haha
8871 2018-07-17 04:46:32 Him: “When you gonna cook for me?” Me: “When you gonna change my oil”

8875 2018-07-17 04:45:04 I'm not against a hybrid either, but I do see gas going the way of the dodo bird. EV's will take over not today, but in the near future they will. Kids are against oil, and that is a good thing. Even JT's young Liberals are fighting him on it, good for them
8876 2018-07-17 04:44:58 Dream wasted all my baby oil all on my floor ughh
8877 2018-07-17 04:44:27 Oil in Russia’s part of the Arctic See. Rosneft can’t drill it now with all the ice.
8878 2018-07-17 04:44:24 Lemon wax melt and lemongrass essential oil in my diffuser... I’m in love 
8879 2018-07-17 04:44:12 Also if you don't understand the difference between objectivity and subjectivity, block me if you must, but do not call me unintelligent.  Olive Oil doesn't call people skinny, you don't call them unintelligent.
8880 2018-07-17 04:44:03 Here’s a wild out idea I’ll get a oil shorter and u get taller we’ll meet in the middle 
8881 2018-07-17 04:43:58 There's nothing like burning some good old midnight oil
8882 2018-07-17 04:43:58 And they all knew it b4 2014 when oil was headed to $25 & Giuliani, RonPaul, Buchanan, FGraham, publicly endorsed Putin over Obama. Any1 remember what happened in 2013 that gave them the nerve to go public? What with I.C. guys like Flynn? Is that too conspiratorial? Too far out?
8883 2018-07-17 04:43:49 Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Canadians are greatful to sell our Gay friendly oil- which helps pay for our free healthcare. @vancouverpride @VictoriaPride @gayvancouver

8888 2018-07-17 04:42:51 ほんまそれなー！
8889 2018-07-17 04:42:49 On my way to appointment: cows on the highway. On the way home: tree fallen on highway and oil spill.

Think I just completed level 3 of Mario carts.

8906 2018-07-17 04:39:41 That isn’t good. I use @NaturesUltra  lime CBD oil and it tastes like candy.
8907 2018-07-17 04:39:38 Putin moved on the Ukraine because his newly discovered oil and pipeline through the Caucasus mandated control of the Black Sea port. Germany's Merkel invested 500 billion in this.
8908 2018-07-17 04:39:21 #WTI & #Brent crude oil drop 3 %

8910 2018-07-17 04:38:47 Had a busy “day off” that included a long to-do list including and not limited to: Confession, gathering moving boxes, doctor’s appt, oil change. The kids opted to come of their own free will. They’re so much cooler than I was when I was a teenager. 
8911 2018-07-17 04:38:23 Tea tree oil my dude 
8912 2018-07-17 04:38:16 Spearmint oil! Put it outside around the walls and they won’t even come in. We live out in a very wooded area and it works very well.

8916 2018-07-17 04:37:07 Some Russian shale oil, a little reminder why he was elected.
8917 2018-07-17 04:37:06 Ororo no be crude oil.
8918 2018-07-17 04:36:47 Una certa dimensione meno globale era già emersa con Obama (guerre tramite proxy e non dirette, shale oil e parziale ritiro da medioriente). Ma un isolazionismo radicale è incompatibile con la potenza USA. Infatti trump vorrebbe alleanza con russi x isolare cinesi e Iran
8919 2018-07-17 04:36:20 Gotcha. My brain had gone off track, but it's back on now. I still think Trump & Putin have a biz deal based on oil from the North Atlantic, sales to EU (despite the lie Trump told), and $$ laundering via Trump hotels/casinos. Dismantling NATO now makes sense for both.
8920 2018-07-17 04:36:13 You will never catch me purchasing shaving cream. Conditioner or coconut oil works great 
8921 2018-07-17 04:35:56 Apa maksud u pakai apa? Hahahaha. Pakai moisturiser, facial oil, eye cream, then nk pakai sheet mask pun boleh.
8922 2018-07-17 04:35:43 Stupid memes, Facebook ads, fake Twitter accts or even real information gleaned by spearfishing dont bother me. Its irrelevant to the fact Hillary Clinton was a horrible candidate that few rational thoughtful ppl liked. And she lost
8923 2018-07-17 04:35:41 A real president is supposed to hate putin and russia yet side with the saudi dictatorship because of oil?

8927 2018-07-17 04:35:29 Look up the connection between Venezuela, Rosneft, and Citgo. Connect that to the Keystone pipeline (which happens to run through the states of the 8 Republicans who spent July 4 in Moscow). It's all about the oil. War would force VE to give RU control.
8928 2018-07-17 04:35:28 I was cooking dinner and the oil popped my ass right in the face left me a burn mark

8933 2018-07-17 04:34:54 Hi, I have to avoid dairy too... and lots of other things. Basically, I can eat air.  Fair warning: most margarines still contain milk solids. I usually sub coconut oil or palm shortening for butter in recipes, depending on the consistency needed.

2 They BK'd Russia with the Commodities act driving oil down
3 Charlie Wilson's War
4 Greased Vince Foster when they had had enough selling of our secrets
8936 2018-07-17 04:33:53 But Merkel can buy all the oil she wants.
8937 2018-07-17 04:33:49 Why we can’t justify why you pick on me about you humping my daddy for free oil changes and weed
8938 2018-07-17 04:33:40 Able-bodied people need to stop telling me what I should put in my diet or suggesting I down five bottles of essential oil.
8939 2018-07-17 04:33:23 + ecostations take used motor oil & filters (and any other household hazardous waste) for free.

8944 2018-07-17 04:32:55 More like the squeaky wheel gets the most oil
8945 2018-07-17 04:32:44 Heads up governments don’t govern oil prices.
8946 2018-07-17 04:32:44 If the castor oil doesn’t have a smell ion trust it
8947 2018-07-17 04:32:36 Actually, I don't want it regulated like onions.

Onions don't have a futures market, so high volatility makes swings in oil and corn prices look tame.
8948 2018-07-17 04:32:33 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
8949 2018-07-17 04:32:31 stop all oil going into the USA
8950 2018-07-17 04:32:18 Why? Russia did nothing that we don’t do.  I mean come on, we not only meddle in elections, since we are so much better than the rest of the world we actually go into countries and topple them. But we only care about countries if there is something in it for us, like oil.
8951 2018-07-17 04:32:10 He sees $400 billion when he looks at Putin & he wants his,so if Treason is his doorway then he's in, just like he wanted to steal all the oil in Iraq he wants all the oil in the Arctic Sea why he picked Rex & immediately rolled back Obama's sanctions for drilling #GOPComplicit
8952 2018-07-17 04:32:06 I also have pain, a rare disease of pain. I am unable to take pain meds beyond Gabapentin. CBD Oil is a God Send too!
8953 2018-07-17 04:31:57 Venesuela must be able to sell its oil and use the high price to recover financially, Royal oil of Ukraine should buy it
8954 2018-07-17 04:31:52 Indeed. Canada’s feminist friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that oppress Women. The world needs more Canada.
8955 2018-07-17 04:31:28 it has dark waves in design its like pulling through oil
8956 2018-07-17 04:31:19 It's a super racing car. Incompatible with the current oil type. Summore nangis tak berlagu kalo hancur engine.

8959 2018-07-17 04:30:50 The only African dictator that really bothers me is Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang. He had the opportunity to build a real life Wakanda. Tiny country, tiny population and 10's of billions in revenue yearly from oil.

8969 2018-07-17 04:28:47 No, Richard, no. Stop wanting more war w another superpower.

Trump's bombed Ru's top ally in Syria, expelled Ru diplomats, imposed more sanctions on Ru, made RT register as a foreign agent, and just criticized Germany for their oil deal w Putin. 

Just stop this neo-McCarthyism.

8971 2018-07-17 04:28:39 He doesn't need to accept his salary because he's getting paid so much by big oil companies for pushing their agendas. He's probably making millions from them and the gun people.
8972 2018-07-17 04:28:31 Ohhh classic African story!!! Scoring own goals!!!  on one hand we want oil prices to go up. On the other hand we buy refined oil at high prices. Massa, I’m done!!!!
8973 2018-07-17 04:28:18 There is no fascism beyond antifa, free speech protectors shutting down free speech. Constitution defenders claiming adherance to a document written by old white men is quaint and judicial outcome supercedes and tailors law. This is our true enemy

8975 2018-07-17 04:28:06 I asked the twitter-verse the same question. Consensus, for non-lethal option - the only option I’d consider - was Peppermint oil spread on their turf. I had limited success. Worth a try?

8978 2018-07-17 04:27:31 If we accept that the predictions are correct, and we cause the warming, is the cost of action worth the  downside? If it is why do we allow China and India to increase global emissions? Y2k, peak oil, global starvation were once all accepted scientific fact! Follow the money !

8985 2018-07-17 04:25:45 the Dawn commercials where they’re cleaning the animals from oil spills makes me want to cry so hard
8986 2018-07-17 04:25:22 Well, for much longer than me, you will be living the consequences of global warming in the last half of this century... 

Famine, mass migrations, economic upheaval - all yours to survive. And big oil won't be there to protect u...
8987 2018-07-17 04:25:16 Anointed with fresh oil.
8988 2018-07-17 04:25:12 Try Citronella candles and lemongrass oil.
8989 2018-07-17 04:25:10 Had a full blown anxiety attack earlier today. CBD oil stopped it. Can't recommend it enough. Not sure the legality of it where you are but honestly look into it. Its a game changer
8990 2018-07-17 04:25:05 I think that oil companies are going to do their absolute best to get us to continue to use oil for as long as they can, even if there is a cheaper/smarter alternative. Never underestimate the power of greed.
8991 2018-07-17 04:24:55 Sanctions currently exist including just telling Germany to reconsider the Oil & Gas deal with Russia which IS Russia's pain point. Sorry someone has to do your reporting for you again Jim (Obama appointee Jim)
8992 2018-07-17 04:24:41 Nice little nod to the Standard Oil octopus. 
8993 2018-07-17 04:24:36 More supply coming online and they're offering waivers for Iranian oil. OPEC doesn't have the spare capacity so no worries long term
8994 2018-07-17 04:24:22 AT OIL, OKY???
8995 2018-07-17 04:24:04 It's not hard. Oil fields are quite close to the city and districts. Just 15 km from downtown Zubair. Many of the locals work in the oil fields as guards, low level wagers... Etc. Doesn't really need a genius to direct them.
8996 2018-07-17 04:23:18 Iran's oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by the end of the year because of new U.S. sanctions, putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere in the world.
8997 2018-07-17 04:23:07 Bought a bunch of stuff to oil paint.
8998 2018-07-17 04:23:07 today someone was like "They have free olive oil tastings at that place" and i was like "lol ew drinking straight olive oil would mess up my stomach" and they were like "wtf tard you dip bread in it??"

9005 2018-07-17 04:22:14 I think you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Iran sells oil and earn money this money was frozen and then it was released. It was not your money!!!!!

If, for moral reasons,  you can't fight the next oil war, then dont walk away, fucking run run.
9012 2018-07-17 04:20:22 Wasn't a gas and oil pipeline planned in the Middle East, two plans, an American or a Russian one?

9018 2018-07-17 04:19:57 Yeah I read it.
But even if somehow electric car is economically viable without subsidies well oil is easy to transport & store while so far electricity from solar is not easy to store in a same scale as oil storage.

9023 2018-07-17 04:19:39 Putin got his arse kicked. He knows he's dealing with in Syria. The Boss. He knows Trump's going after his oil/gas market in W. Europe. He knows Trump is arming Ukranian militias. US GDP is about 20x Russia's. Putin couldn't win a game of jacks.

9033 2018-07-17 04:17:53 10-15% maximum. They do that in europe too. Coal is not a great idea IMHO
But yes, I agree, there are alternatives
Problem is, oil industry resists change
Left wing extremist greenies push to change overnight
What we need is responsible strategy, balancing economics & environment

9042 2018-07-17 04:16:48 Things you named give rise to widespread support. In our case,  more a perception than a reality, driven by media, pseudo intellectuals in education indoctrinating youth and cocktail socialists theorizing on a perfect society without consequences for them.

9078 2018-07-17 04:12:17 Products~
-Use natural products
-Stay away from sulfates in shampoo to prevent frizzy and frayed hair
-Use conditioners with pure substances like aloe, coconut oil and Shea butter
-Avoid products with a lot of chemicals you can't pronounce
-You can make your own hair gel instead

9081 2018-07-17 04:11:00 Musk loses US$295 million as Tesla shares fall after ‘pedo’ attack on cave rescuer 
The Washington Post needs to wake up. Elon Musk is no "role model". He is a snake oil salesman with a sinking car business.
9082 2018-07-17 04:10:48 But take note, if the past leaders (pdp) had invested in these states when the going was good for Nigeria (I mean oil prices), by now these States would have sufficient absorber to survive these hard times. But no, they ignored developmental projects but embraced chop-I-chop.

9086 2018-07-17 04:10:29 I'm of the mind to organize a marches on DC and NY and start jailing every politician and lobbyist. Find who they work for then jail those fuckers too. Pharma, banks, oil, foreign powers and anyone who thinks they can rewrite our laws for their benefit. Fuck 'em.

9090 2018-07-17 04:10:02 Not even close. It’s way cheaper to DIY. But only if you plan ahead and buy oil and filters on sale.
9091 2018-07-17 04:09:43 Try mixing oil with it sis!!!!!!
9092 2018-07-17 04:09:28 Yaga was as I've served you, then she was no way of hers first, and the river, and walked, till she poured oil on their hinges,

9094 2018-07-17 04:09:17 If Trump has convinced Putin to increase his oil output helping bring down gas prices along with pushing Iranian soldiers further away from Israel’s borders it will be more than Obama ever accomplished

1. Combine one egg yolk, one tablespoon of honey, and one tablespoon of olive oil (yes, olive oil) with half a cup of oatmeal.
2. Stir well, then apply it to your face for 15-20 minutes.
3. Rinse with lukewarm water and then moisturize.

9103 2018-07-17 04:07:51 Oil prices drop. Lower energy shares keep Stock prices in check. S&amp;P ending with modest loss.
9104 2018-07-17 04:07:44 Crude dropped over 4% yesterday.  Oil marketing companies (IOC, BPCL and HPCL) can outperform today.  Also need to keep an eye on aviation companies like Indigo, Jet airways and Spice jet.

9108 2018-07-17 04:06:59 Government will likely need to foot the bill, as there’s little economic incentive. Although oil and gas companies have begun doing this for enhanced oil recovery (but that kind of defeats the purpose). Govt can pay for it directly or they can tax companies to incentivize them.

- Permanently occupying Syria. 
- Sending warships into the Black Sea next to Russia's border. 
- Calling out Germany for having oil deals with Russia instead of having deals with the US. 
- Sending arms to Ukrainian Rebels.
9113 2018-07-17 04:05:39 Reuters says it will take off for India this month. It is impressive how rapidly India increased its oil imports from the US.

9138 2018-07-17 04:00:55 Think about it this way. @realDonaldTrump treats other countries, EU, Mexico, etc., much differently than he treats Russia, for seemingly no reason. Why?

1. Pag nagfafry ka, mag sprinkle ka ng salt dun sa pan para di tumilamsik yung oil. (pag ginawa mo 'to mas madali rin iflip yung piniprito mo)

9175 2018-07-17 03:55:04 It's difficult to say because I've been so much worse. That's what drove me to the CBD oil. I can't tell if I'm calmer from the oil or if I'm adapting to a higher frequency of anxiety.

9178 2018-07-17 03:54:46 Could have sworn I heard Putin (7/16) suggest that oil be held to a  set price for all producers that would allow profits but also would be fair to customers. That's not a new idea but it's one that might ensure less guessing and better planning.

9183 2018-07-17 03:54:23 Just a thought
Is Donald Trump actually being paid by Russia to tear down our democracy?
Oil interests, natural gas shares, we all know he will do anything for money in his pocket, this has potential for an investigation by the US Intelligence community
9184 2018-07-17 03:54:22 Dude I know dude, this is a proof that the economist prime Minister didn't pay the oil bill as 2015. Some brother is asking where is the oil money, it is true that Modi collects more taxes on oil, but that is used to repay the loans. Not just oil loan, but world bank also.
9185 2018-07-17 03:54:08 Ok. I’ve always seen people just poke a hole in them and use it lol never actually take them. I have the oil and love it. So ima go buy some of the pills too. Hopefully the 2 together give me some black girl magic

9189 2018-07-17 03:53:08 Challenge not to use 7273 gallons of olive oil in everything I cook
9190 2018-07-17 03:53:01 Maybe you could spread a view lavender leaves around your bed/in your bed room before sleeping.. or gently rub a tiny little bit of pure organic lavender oil on your wrists and ankles for example before meditation or before you go to bed.. Maybe that helps..
9191 2018-07-17 03:52:53 True, these guys are not entirely what we anticipated.  But the PDP led govt was way worse. Imagine how far we would have been developed if we had made good use of all that oil money. Now oil prices are close to peanuts.
9192 2018-07-17 03:52:50 Also. Conversation heard at the mall. “If I don’t have lube, does olive oil work?” “Sure! Probably best to use the extra virgin kind though”

If he was able to be black mailed, wouldn’t see him keeping tough sanctions, being upset with Germany for buying their oil, or sending antitank missiles to Ukraine to fight Russia. T understands need to converse to make deals
9205 2018-07-17 03:51:09 Yeah, they exist but money. We now just use a wok and a separate filter. Our gas range has a frying mode to keep temperature stable. (Uses less oil but more scary).

9217 2018-07-17 03:49:25 The #StableGenius cunningly plays the nice guy, while wielding a big, fat stick. Words won't hurt Putin. But the US oil booms does. Arming Ukraine's resistance does. Booting Russian spies does. Killing Syria's Russian mercenaries does.
9218 2018-07-17 03:49:18 Dear @Twitter I am for suspending fake accounts, spams, malware links and so on. But please, also go after fake celebs & fake military scams along with, "CEO/Oil Rig"dudes only following ladies. Obvious fake accounts & criteria, I see it, you should too. FYI

9226 2018-07-17 03:48:53 I kept asking the man, what was the point of making an appointment if I was going to have to wait 2.5 hours for an oil change. All he could tell me was they were backed up.
9227 2018-07-17 03:48:31 in which case, the country has money.  can you stick with one argument?  Trump has nothing going on with Russia.  he just blasted Germany for buying their oil.  low oil prices are hurting Russia badly.  yet you persist with this Dem fairy tale.

- Trump told Germany NOT to do oil deal with Russia 2 days ago.
- Trump is supplying Ukraine with weapons to battle Russia.
- Trump put big sanctions on Russia.

9335 2018-07-17 03:32:54 I would certainly look at terrorism adjacent scenarios, such as a crude oil car explosion in the middle of a city, maybe a chemical leak in a subway. 

How does the disaster response determine terrorism?
Is the response efficient and thorough for a possible criminal investigation

9343 2018-07-17 03:31:55 This is a deceleration of war, not that these two sides haven't been at war but any oil or gas embargo is seen as such. This should get ugly really quick, gas and petrol is important for normal living and the civilians are going to feel this bad.

9359 2018-07-17 03:29:48 yea but... i know nothing more powerful / profitable than big oil and big coal.  it doesn't make any sense to me that there would be an agenda against these two most profitable industries.
9360 2018-07-17 03:29:45 Tea tree oil & the aloe vera plant is helping w my skin 
9361 2018-07-17 03:29:39 "Gross whataboutisms and no evidence"- where is the server? This is the most important question of all- why did the FBI never subpoena the allegedly hacked server if it couldn't gain access to it? Trump didn't cut our oil or coal production and has stood by the Balkans/Ukraine.
9362 2018-07-17 03:29:32 I think Trump already has a piece of the Russian oil pie, and that's why he wants to lift sanctions on them. Rosneft deal. He was promised a percentage if he became president and lifted the sanctions.
9363 2018-07-17 03:29:11 I wonder who uses the palm oil, most city dwelling middle class (not sure of rural consumer) has shifted to non-palm oil consumption. It's the bakery industry which still uses palm oil in most products.
9364 2018-07-17 03:29:09 Working from home is the best.
Got an oil change, hungout with my friend all day in the office, didn’t have to leave the comfort of my own home..zero traffic to deal with...I can get used to this
9365 2018-07-17 03:29:02 It's very easy to twist data to suit our positions. e.g. Olive oil has 7x the saturated fat of red meat.  Without context it's a shocking notion, but still true.

As for dietary cholesterol, it's a dead horse. Even the 2015-2020 DGA states it's no longer a nutrient for concern.

9367 2018-07-17 03:28:06 you know how solid fats (coconut oil, butter, etc) will become liquid when it gets hot? i feel like the fat in my boobs do the same thing.
9368 2018-07-17 03:28:04 A cross-subsidy fuelled by a levy on oil users resumed as State Oil Fund for cooking gas is already broke: Energy Ministry. 
(The reality is that consumers subsidise energy hungry old fashioned manufacturers) Cooking gas prices have saw a whopping increase of 160% under the junta

9370 2018-07-17 03:27:58 What special interest money do you accept? What donors line your campaign pockets?? How much has your wealth increased since taking off?

It is only a matter of time before a pipeline compamy wants that farm to help ship oil/gas to the EU. Few thousand $$$ and you fast track it!
9371 2018-07-17 03:27:54 Hannity shouldn’t be interviewing Trump because they have made love to each other on multiple occasions.  It’s biased.  Hannity has spread oil all over this man’s back during long, sensual massage sessions.  He can’t ask balanced questions.

9375 2018-07-17 03:27:47 After launching #Yuan-denominated crude oil futures, China also opened fuel oil contract, its 2nd bonded energy futures. By creating trading venues in its own currency, the world's largest oil importer seeks to gain greater pricing power over the key resource.
9376 2018-07-17 03:27:39 2/. And did Norway use its oil revenue to diversify its economy, with many industries being state owned?

9477 2018-07-17 03:13:29 Olive oil is used to anoint something and make it Holy. It seems the Angels are trying to tell something about this,I understand omens and signs and it seems that the Holy God is weeping over the Church on what it is doing. It's God's way of letting us know His sorrow.

9493 2018-07-17 03:10:57 She target shoots! She paints! She's besties with Middle Eastern oil tycoons!
9494 2018-07-17 03:10:50 Awww...you’re so charming!  I can change the oil, brake pads and have rebuilt a carburetor too.  I bet Chelle can too.

9496 2018-07-17 03:10:41 Sourdough bread dipped in oil. Cheesy tamales. Chocolate mousse. Now I’m hungry ...

9500 2018-07-17 03:10:26 Let’s be honest, y’all don’t like dark skin women foreal. It’s all a cap! Y’all only like them when they’re naked, covered in oil, or glitter.

9504 2018-07-17 03:09:52 I prefer to use grape seed oil.
9505 2018-07-17 03:09:12 LIVING for this Argan & hemp seed oil i've been using on my hair
9506 2018-07-17 03:09:01 unlike Sasse-
some of us have the ability to see beyond the beltway-
with Germany subjecting itself to Russia for 70% of their daily oil consumption-
what the hell are we doing in NATO?
reason the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor was Rooseveldt was stranding their army in China- NO OIL-
9507 2018-07-17 03:08:57 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
9508 2018-07-17 03:08:47 I need my body rub down with oil 
9509 2018-07-17 03:08:09 Just to be fair, it could be COPD and not actually Asthma, but for me the results were the same. Smoking is bad for that condition. It could be rendered into a zero residue oil and utilized in a vapo-pen, even as an emergency inhaler.
9510 2018-07-17 03:08:07 The bus park in Kiambu Town will be moved elsewhere following a directive by the Environment and Lands Court.

9512 2018-07-17 03:07:53 My entire body is bright red from the level of exfoliating I just did w/ that volcano stone but worth it!

9515 2018-07-17 03:07:18 Tex 1 kontrakt crude oil som kan settlas fysiskt = 1 000 barrels = $80/brl * 1 000 = $80,000

E-mini kontrakt 500 brl = $40,000

Finns micro-kontrakt på valutor etc

9517 2018-07-17 03:07:14 Arthritis sucks. Even with CBD oil, it only helps the area I put it on my neck but the pain still teaches up onto the back of my head. Now I am feeling older

9522 2018-07-17 03:06:39 @StevenGordon_Ca read the article! It says the sanctions lifted in IRAN caused more oil to be on the market which lowered oil prices.
Obviously you and the original tweeter failed to read the article.
ROFL at both of you.

9526 2018-07-17 03:06:26 @Habon_PMYC can u point out where u have called on the government to stop importing blood oil ? Called out the governments (federal and/or provincial) for spewing raw sewage into the pacific and the St.Lawrence. Stopping rail and transport trucks from moving oil.
9527 2018-07-17 03:06:23 Keep an eye on Balkrishna Industries Ltd as the company sees a challenging business environment for exports due to protectionism measures by some countries, various geopolitical issues, and rising crude oil prices and interest rates
9528 2018-07-17 03:06:21 I could deff use that beard oil
9529 2018-07-17 03:05:59 Irrelevant, no need for an article. Germany not buying oil is very bad for Russia. All Russia has is oil. If you wanna pick that apart fine,also kept the 2014 sanctions, approved a Ukrainian arms deal (which obama wouldn’t), & has been bombing Russia sites in Syria, among others
9530 2018-07-17 03:05:57 Keep an eye on Oil marketing companies, aviation companies as crude oil falls below $73

9543 2018-07-17 03:03:51 It’s a philosophy. Israel has been very bad for America. Oil embargoes, terrorism, useless wars, lobbying against free speech, assassinations, false flag attacks. You cannot have two masters. I argue for America, you argue for Israel.

And getting the price of oil up past $100 by whatever means. War, terror, hot peace, displacement of millions. Maria Bitina almost asking to be pardoned??

4.  Reduce tensions with Iran

9595 2018-07-17 02:57:20 You correct luliane, declarations will not cut it! What  would work would be crippling sanctions, getting the world to cut off consumption of Russian oil for starters.  He did none of that
9596 2018-07-17 02:57:10 Oil slumps more than 4%, Brent @ 3-month low, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia, other producers.

9601 2018-07-17 02:56:49 I expect hostile countries to use every mechanism to advance their geopolitical interests. It is our country's job to prevent it. I also expect the media to conspire with democrats against every national republican--using similar techniques as foreign national actors.

9621 2018-07-17 02:53:56 He is probably in Moscow inking an oil deal.

9624 2018-07-17 02:53:50 I mean yeah, a lot of the oligarchs' money is in oil, sure. It has implications. But I don't see what Trump being compromised by Putin has to do with climate change. The idea is if we stop using oil, Putin would no longer have any power? Is that the link?
9625 2018-07-17 02:53:49 Did it keep giving you oil level alerts?
9626 2018-07-17 02:53:36 Chris, this is what these snake oil salesmen want. Deflect and escalate. You keep churning facts. Keep working!! Santorum - the guy who said school kids should learn CPR in case of future school shootings. To argue with an idiot is pointless.

9632 2018-07-17 02:52:38 I would still like some well tuned arguments as to why we cant burn the stuff. After all plastic is just congealed oil is it not?  Surely they can burn, filter & capture nasty emissions. Am happy to pay a tax on all plastics I buy calculated by the kilo. To deal with reprocessing
9633 2018-07-17 02:52:36 Madam one more thing

9637 2018-07-17 02:52:24 palm oil is not good for health, why our farmers do not produce mustard/coconut oil.
9638 2018-07-17 02:52:19 He's getting away with making the best international deals for Trump Industries. He's a grifter, and you apparently enjoy snake oil,  my friend.

9646 2018-07-17 02:50:59 What’s the frequency Donald? Meanwhile Skinhead Putin: “I think that we as major oil and gas power and the US is a major gas oil power as well, we can work together on regulation of international markets because neither of us is actually interested in plummeting of the prices.”
9647 2018-07-17 02:50:59 What exactly did he win? No relief in sanctions, none of 60 expelled diplomats allowed back in, arms still being sold to Ukraine, missile defense still being deployed & USA now exporting gas & oil to directly compete with him.
9648 2018-07-17 02:50:54 We use this a lot too. Fries. Getting excess oil out of fried goodies we buy outside. Even making buffalo wings
9649 2018-07-17 02:50:46 Yo I’m driving there in FAITH that I’m gonna get good gas mileage so my tank stays filled until Friday 

Remember the woman with oil? SHE JUST NEEDED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT SHE HAD WAS ENOUGH EVEN IF IT WASNT A LOT.
9650 2018-07-17 02:50:41 Let me know how it turns out. I winged it with the seasoning & let the potatoes & shallots simmer over olive oil for about 12-13 then added the chickpeas (tossed in paprika & garlic salt), let them cook together for an additional 5 while i finished up the rice.
9651 2018-07-17 02:50:24 Fresh aloe is the new coconut oil.

9659 2018-07-17 02:48:46 There’s no money in Trade with Russia,  we should be decreasing dependence on oil. We won the Cold War. What do we get from Russia in exchange for Trump’s treasonous behavior? #Nothing #TrumpPutinSummit
9660 2018-07-17 02:48:45 Barry's trip to Saudi King comes to mind . Bows to the King like some obliging Muslim. Next thing we know oil markets collapse and recession covers the Globe .... Trump will survive the hysterics from his enemies. MAGA !
9661 2018-07-17 02:48:28 Here’s a potential antidote for the current mass hysteria playing out on social and corporate sponsored media: watch Incredibles 2, the Church hearings and then How Big Oil Conquered the World — you’re welcome 
9662 2018-07-17 02:48:22 Oil itu plg terakhir
9663 2018-07-17 02:48:19 There's a reason why most of the Republican party (& many Democrats for that matter) aren't doing something..... follow the campaign donations! Russian oil $ is still Russian $
9664 2018-07-17 02:48:19 Even cooking oil.
9665 2018-07-17 02:48:13 And then he thinks, “but I’m a fuckstick who took the job to ease sanctions and get at that sweet, sweet oil that the god damn sanctions are cock blocking BP and company from getting at”
9666 2018-07-17 02:48:07 There's no side to an oil slick except the oil. Trump is an oil slick.

9671 2018-07-17 02:47:48 All three are true. It’s not an either/or. PLUS Putin & friendsare promising him tangible rewards involving real estate and oil.
9672 2018-07-17 02:47:01 Yes agreed. Why we need to import if the same is available through godrej agrovet which produces a lot of palm oil.
9673 2018-07-17 02:46:51 食べたんですけど、イライラしか生まれなかったです笑笑
9674 2018-07-17 02:46:45 It's nice of Russia to help collapse the price if oil. There are two world regimes hurting people that gain their income from oil.
9675 2018-07-17 02:46:44 Weirdly enough most of my self care happens around bedtime. Lavender tea, silk face mask, lavender oil sprinkled on the sheets and a mouth guard to protect my teef. Why do I not put this much effort in when I’m conscious?

Preventative wise, it's been helping to add fish oil and other anti inflammation herbs to my diet. I can't say if it will work wonders for someone who does it more for business but it has helped me.
9730 2018-07-17 02:38:34 Yeah, it was fun having that wrangle the other week about the need for more “civility” from non-Trumpers. As if we’d been treated w any respect at all by the apologists for orphaning refugee kids & letting oil co shills dismantle EPA etc ad nauseam.

Still #MAGA but honest enough to state the truth.
9762 2018-07-17 02:35:01 That's been going on for 2 years...nothing on the man.

Of course, working to strengthen NATO and admonishing Germany for doing so much oil business with Russia ain't exactly 'protecting Putin'.

9792 2018-07-17 02:31:06 Yes, Trump 
1. Took pressure off Iran (proxy of Russia)
2. Put regulations on domestic gas and oil
3. Stopped the pipeline
4. Decreased military spending.
5. Didn't push NATO countries to increase military spending

Wait, no that was Obama

9801 2018-07-17 02:30:30 That was 123 for  2.5 hours but they were 2" thick.  You didn't ask but the key is the cast iron with a MINIMAL amount of oil or you'll taste it. May take a couple of times but when you get it right it's outstanding!

9808 2018-07-17 02:29:40 It sounds silly, but works for me...buy run-of-the-mill catnip. Boil it in water, drain it into a spray bottle, and dilute it with water. (you're essentially making a catnip essential oil spray). Tons of "Recipes" online for it. I find it effective!
9809 2018-07-17 02:29:39 weighed blankets are amazing in my opinion. Using Lavender essential oil on a little cloth or cotton pad inside your pillow case is amazing. But the most helpful thing I've found is if I'm struggling: Get out of bed and do something else for a few minutes.

9893 2018-07-17 02:17:28 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle did a reasonable presentation on today’s events! Besides Trump foot in mouth usual event, the most critical dealing is  with getting along methods. The greatest non combative impact on Russia, is getting oil/natural gas prices back down!
9894 2018-07-17 02:17:16 Extra Virgin olive oil?
9895 2018-07-17 02:17:13 โอ้ววว เยอะมากก
9896 2018-07-17 02:17:10 @IngrahamAngle All the things that the President would be doing if he was tight with Putin: limiting fracking, blocking oil/gas pipelines, cutting U.S. military spending and reducing tensions with Iran are EXACTLY the things that President Obama did!
9897 2018-07-17 02:16:51 on my foot I've had a healed bug bite that left a scar & I finally bothered putting rose hip oil on it..maybe treating it will make it better?! 

9898 2018-07-17 02:16:50 @realDonaldTrump Republican’s believed because he sold like any “snake oil salesman”. We ALL wake up at some point! Americans Will NOT Allow a Traitor for  @POTUS Impeach Now! @mikebarnicle @CBSNews @abcnews @NBCNews @CNN @FoxNews @PBS @JoeNBC @SenateGOP
9899 2018-07-17 02:16:50 Ini maksud mbaknya 'tahap cleansing oil bisa diganti pake micellar water' gitu? Apa gimana?
9900 2018-07-17 02:16:38 Canola oil once again got beaten by olive oil! I was surprised coconut oil didn’t make the cut. You’ll get the left’s attention if it was coconut oil. But EVOO is a cleaver choice Mary
9901 2018-07-17 02:16:33 Worth ,di aku bikin cerah tapi kadang males sih karna dia teksture nya oil jd suka berminyak pas bangun tdr kalo makenya kebanyakan

9904 2018-07-17 02:16:04 Yeah okay. But what's your point? They had a right wing oil sucking freak at the other end of the committee and everything in between. That's how democracy works.

9915 2018-07-17 02:15:19 I bet you're still mad about the NEP too. Had we kept the NEP we wouldn't be importing any oil. But I'm sure you already knew that.
9916 2018-07-17 02:15:07 Democrats are a greater threat than some stupid Facebook ads and phoney Twitter acts. 
Its who Trump is, but his winging it and imprecise language create self inflicted wounds. I wish he would evolve a little and be more careful. Some issues really demand it

9918 2018-07-17 02:15:01 Just a reminder.  This mess WE ARE ALL IN is over a land deal for Trump and oil prices for Vlad.  Fuck you #MAGAts
9919 2018-07-17 02:14:39 told you to use that oil 
9920 2018-07-17 02:14:26 LOL. You guys understand how much olive oil you can buy for ten bucks, right? @rupertmurdoch
9921 2018-07-17 02:14:23 Does Germany need Russian oil more than Russia needs German cash?
9922 2018-07-17 02:14:21 Someone needs to come out with a Olive Oil and Parmesan flavored potato chip @LAYS
9923 2018-07-17 02:13:55 Itu bukan oil tapi water wkwkkekwke gimana mijetnya ntar :( pake mc aja
9924 2018-07-17 02:13:54 Sold at COSTCO? might not be Oilive oil after all?
9925 2018-07-17 02:13:44 Yeah, that was obvious to anyone paying attention. the last year. Putin wants the TRILLIONS of dollars in oil in the Siberian fields. For that, he needs Exxon tech and lifting of sanctions. That'd make him the richest, most powerful man in the world. Absolutely untouchable.

9930 2018-07-17 02:12:59 Extra Virgin Olive oil, I am assuming.

9934 2018-07-17 02:12:34 I keep forgetting that my damn car need an oil change. 
9935 2018-07-17 02:12:18 Poor #Maga 's  Someday you will see the truth. Until then, try to get through these trying days where you will see Tump/Putin selling you their snake oil. 
9936 2018-07-17 02:12:14 I have a man, thank you. He is sexy as hell and an amazing southern gentleman who happens to work in the oil field and travels and wasn't available for the photo that day. Again, you're the bully.

9938 2018-07-17 02:12:03 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
9939 2018-07-17 02:12:03 If one eye had olive oil and the other had balsamic, THEN I would call it a miracle.
9940 2018-07-17 02:12:03 I mix it with grape seed oil in my diffuser when I have headaches & it’s everything
9941 2018-07-17 02:11:57 Maybe she should cut off the oil pipeline deal with Putin duh!?
9942 2018-07-17 02:11:48 We have  to ban oil,  it's  a weapon  of greed  and it's  destroying  earth  so badly  it's  unbelievable.
9943 2018-07-17 02:11:48 Thanks Susan, it was just what I needed. Not sure how healthy once all the oil had been added...but it tasted good!

9946 2018-07-17 02:11:26 One Possible Strategy For America is to ally with Russia, I am not crazy, but if you understand the Globe, then you know resources Oil, Gas, China, Europe, Japan Have none. It's In Russia, USA, South America, Canada that do. I am not sure If this is Trumps Play but?
9947 2018-07-17 02:11:26 I recommend some Brussels sprouts and asparagus, those make excellent snacks, a little salt and Pepper with some olive oil, throw it in the oven for about fifteen minutes or when slightly tanned!
Delicious!!!!
9948 2018-07-17 02:11:07 Tea Tree oil is my new favorite thing.
9949 2018-07-17 02:11:05 Arnt they getting very positive results using THC oil? Worth a try and it’s natural
9950 2018-07-17 02:10:47 Vegetable broth.  I posted no oil cooking tips on this thread
9951 2018-07-17 02:10:46 Pake oil based cleanser dulu sebelum cuci muka. Habis itu pake toner, double toning juga bole. Pelembab terus sunscreen deh. 

Produknya disamain sama cewe gamasalah sih tapi kamunya mau apa ga...

9956 2018-07-17 02:10:28 What’s sad is that I know local oil families and I can attest that none of this will phase them at all as long as they keep making money.
9957 2018-07-17 02:10:26 Idk, some type of oil or bronzer
9958 2018-07-17 02:10:24 alberta girl born and raised, and my husbands work relies on oil. i will never support trump.
9959 2018-07-17 02:10:16 I'm not fat phonic, I just know how much olive oil many people consume.  It is unnecessary and you are better off eating the whole plant foods lilke olives, nuts, and avocados.
9960 2018-07-17 02:10:14 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？

9964 2018-07-17 02:09:54 I wonder why people don't carry blessing oil no longer. #BringBlessoilback
9965 2018-07-17 02:09:42 It drives me crazy that I can’t edit posts on twitter!
9966 2018-07-17 02:09:40 The great Democrat deity completely discredited this whole stupid new narrative 2 months before the election. Does CNN not keep records just play the snake oil salesman own words. Quit whining I think was part of it.#LMAO #MAGA #hypocrisy
9967 2018-07-17 02:09:38 Tell @seanhannity to pull his head from Trump's rump. I'm #MAGA,  but facts are facts. 
Trump was horrible at presser. Some here seem more like worshippers than truth tellers and not doing @POTUS any favors. 
He screwed the pooch here, be honest.
9968 2018-07-17 02:09:24 The grid you speak of is powered by oil, gas, nuclear, & hydro
All of those massive producing systems generate a ton of power with control systems that regulate production according to need - from the grid.
Windmills can't produce more when needed. Unless u build more windmills
9969 2018-07-17 02:08:56 Bears attack bee hives, raccoons get in the corn, birds eat blueberries, pharmaceutical, oil, insurance, medical companies and Russians try to influence elections. There are ways to stop them with out shooting them. Senators-Do your job!!
9970 2018-07-17 02:08:55 It is an essential oil. Was he going down the organic aisle?   I would recommend Frankinsense cause it smells really good and it is a bit cheaper.

9979 2018-07-17 02:07:21 trump and Putin met about how to maximize profits. and that’s always thru 2 avenues: oil, war. I suspect that there will be fake anti Russo saber rattling by GOP here and small proxy skirmishes in key pipeline territories in EU/ME that guarantee US/RUS defense companies get paid.

9982 2018-07-17 02:07:14 "producing more oil and gas", Senator? Perhaps you've heard of some newer tech coming down the line, pulls energy right out of the sun, I've even heard tell of wind power, too. And hey you know we can sell that tech too, right? FFS
9983 2018-07-17 02:07:07 it help’s to not have too much butter/oil depending on the pan you use... with a non-stick less is better...
9984 2018-07-17 02:06:54 In the age of analysts screaming at each other on CNBC and accusing people of shilling for oil and coal, this was incredibly refreshing. I really enjoyed the collegiate type debate format.
9985 2018-07-17 02:06:49 Seriously, who has not tried CBD Oil yet?
9986 2018-07-17 02:06:46 knew it!
that’s what they’ve been planning.
i think bibi & erdogan are in on it too. i think that’s what the call to salman was about, & they’re trying to get pakistani president hussain on board—hence the terror attack.

putin wants to rebuild USSR, w/oil, ports & a pipeline.
9987 2018-07-17 02:06:44 Is there any plan to blockade the Panama Canal to stop the rogue Venezuelan oil tankers from making a run to Chi$a ...err... points West?
9988 2018-07-17 02:06:37 Wow, perception is so strong that all those people that have been complaining about Tax, PTPTN, toll fees, oil prices and etc suddenly stop complaining. 

Eventhough, there is not much change to everything I listed. Literally no change pun hahahahhaa

9992 2018-07-17 02:06:15 So, I’ve finally taken my hair down. And I’m up a inch and a half. I kept these braids in since June 9th. So a little over a month. But I’ve been putting JBC oil on my hair 3 days a week.

10000 2018-07-17 02:05:13 SHOUT OUT TO @alexa_santos13 SANTOESS for checking the my car oil yesterday 
10001 2018-07-17 02:05:09 If our bodies are to be treated as temples, then we need to flush the plumbing when it gets backed up.  We need to dust the cob webs away, we need to oil the hinges, wash away the dirt and that includes exorcising those demons that otherwise will possess you.
10002 2018-07-17 02:05:09 Why do you think they run out of oil?
10003 2018-07-17 02:04:55 To prove @ShashiTharoor  wrong, Kerala BJP yuva morcha goons only vandalised Tharoor's workplace, threatened to kill him & shouted slogans to go to Pakistan and poured black engine oil on signs, doors, walls, gates. It is very unlike of TTP, who only do suicide bombings.
10004 2018-07-17 02:04:43 So I use cetaphil as a gentle cleanser, and I tone with 1/2 apple cider vinegar 1/2 water, and then use a thin layer of coconut oil as a moisturizer! I’ve had cystic acne my entire life and this is the only thing that has genuinely helped and it naturally balances your PH
