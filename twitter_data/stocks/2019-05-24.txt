1 2019-05-26 23:56:48 I’m tryna buy stocks cuz everything low right now but idk what shares I want
2 2019-05-26 23:56:14 Nah.  It’s fear of losing their opulent lifestyle and having to pay their fair share while watching their pharma/Wall Street/military industrial complex/ oil stocks drop.
3 2019-05-26 23:55:49 oh, and also investing in a good # of stocks but all were essentially high volatility tech stocks. gotta trade in areas you feel comfortable.
4 2019-05-26 23:55:49 A general opinion based question here. No right answer. Should every person hedge their life expenses with ownership of an oil etf, futures, stocks? Everyone is subject to the cost of gas...
5 2019-05-26 23:55:09 I think if the price of uranium goes up  uranium stocks will go up also. Could be temporary weakness along the way. Look at what happened to North American Palladium stock as PD prices rallied last year.
6 2019-05-26 23:54:59 I'm all about respect and homie stocks are sick, but Megaman's blade was the reason Daisy died. The stock was unnecessary. Generous but really unnecessary.
7 2019-05-26 23:53:33 But, I see it as gold of 21st century. Just cos' it beats gold in all aspects which make gold expensive, and investment worthy. (yes gold is shitty investment, but people's will to buy it make it worthy). Good diversification from stocks. Real one.
8 2019-05-26 23:53:24 All I want to know is, what stocks go up in war time?
9 2019-05-26 23:52:20 The first time I explained to my son that I trade stocks he said "Isn't that gambling?" 
10 2019-05-26 23:52:07 i reviewed my trades over the last 3 years recently and concluded that trading 3x etf’s did a lot of damage to my capital. thus, i stay away from this vehicle as well as other areas i am not good at such as vix etf’s and chinese stocks.
11 2019-05-26 23:50:11 How are stocks looking? Can you tell if things are selling out ahead of the official opening?
12 2019-05-26 23:49:39 yes sir! all coins are still currently treated like stocks. i have to assume this is due to the lack of utility. once this picks up i hope the coins' price is not so driven by predicting prices or studying trends. can you imagine buying ETH for your project at volatile prices???
13 2019-05-26 23:45:14 Giles tore 2 ACLs as well. Porter's young, even by soph standards. In trying to find historical comps, it became clear how hard it was to find other front court players his size with 3-point range, an assist-to-turnover ratio above 1 and strong stocks. I'd still be worried tho.
14 2019-05-26 23:45:11 Everyone else: At a party or some crazy event today, having fun.

Me: Eating chicken pot pie in the shower and reading about investing in stocks.
15 2019-05-26 23:44:12 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
16 2019-05-26 23:43:55 Could argue shale was a bubble

Housing prices higher than last bubble

Tech bubble 2.0

Government bond bubble

Most stocks trade at low single digit earnings yields - general stock bubble

The “everything bubble”
17 2019-05-24 23:58:53 SHE ONLY HAS JAEHYUN LEFT UNTIL STOCKS LAST ITS 23$
18 2019-05-24 23:58:17 The risk being mitigated against is the risk of the short term on that type of diversification. Think of it like how some invest in stocks, bonds, and unit funds. The diversify expecting all to succeed but if one fails, the other will support the loss (some safer than others).
19 2019-05-24 23:56:47 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $VEC was 18% Positive, with $SPX 9% Positive. #ASX
20 2019-05-24 23:56:31 Green flag for the first time in 2019! The Middleport Mechanical Thunder Stocks kick off Ackland Insurance Opening Night. #OHS2019
21 2019-05-24 23:54:34 Buy Chinese stocks
22 2019-05-24 23:54:15 Diversification doesn't have to be through multiple purchases by the ind. Pooled funds solved that. But for ind stocks a diversified port aims to maximize risk adjusted returns. Taking uncorr stocks returns, geography, industry, etc. Large funds have to do this.
23 2019-05-24 23:52:23 My buddies company does stuff like that for stocks and sports just spits out x did y after z happened snippets. It’s why blogger like you rock
24 2019-05-24 23:50:41  are the giving  Amazon stocks too
25 2019-05-24 23:49:05 I missed it too cuz I was at work 

It ended with Nairo(Daisy) vs Samsora with 3 stocks each and Samsora won last hit
26 2019-05-24 23:47:33 Aw got so close at winning that match in the Smash Bros Ultimate tournament...although I'm mad at myself for accidentally offing one of my stocks, I still had fun. Plus, the loser's bracket is still here!!!
27 2019-05-24 23:47:24 I’m not sure if this means, just stay out of stocks for awhile or be invested in a few high quality 3%-8% dividend stocks and ride it out.
28 2019-05-24 23:46:38 Definitely getting closer. 
I'm so focused on individual stocks in recent years the lack of vol hasn't mattered so much.
29 2019-05-24 23:44:07 哈哈哈 你还没释怀？ 我估计 也就是有钱人随便买点stocks玩玩
30 2019-05-24 23:43:46 Wish you could front run stocks like you do the news
31 2019-05-24 23:43:14 Vampire Weekend the curator is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is unfriended and blocked on myspace by Hunter.
32 2019-05-24 23:43:12 They report what they see.  They found 1050 spent 5.56mm cases in the room, and they found that every 5.56mm weapon in the room had a bump stock fitted.  But they did not observe him closely while he was shooting, so they could not see him using the bump stocks.
33 2019-05-24 23:43:05 You're in error. These "prearranged" buyers are called Core Investors; they're the guys who're willing to pay ~70% lump-sum for controlling stakes. No one waits on proceeds from Penny-Stocks which can take years to be subscribed. Clear?
Could U have afforded to buy any of them?
34 2019-05-24 23:43:05 I get the larger point. I’m also aware that the most traded stocks on RH aren’t quality names. Usually stocks with low share prices ($GE $F or momo like $TSLA). Just saying that a dearth of $BRK.A ownership doesn’t imply an entirely short-term trading focus for all RH accounts.
35 2019-05-24 23:42:39 Sana ngayon dumating stocks! Hahahaha
36 2019-05-24 23:42:01 I took a second job in a supermarket last year to clear some debt and save for a mortgage. It was fucking torture, but my one concession each payday was to treat myself to a bottle to build up my stocks. It was worth it.
37 2019-05-25 23:58:44 The feature order for later tonight:  Sprints, Limited Late Models, Roadrunners, and finally Pro Stocks.
38 2019-05-25 23:57:59 Street Stocks heat finishes

39 2019-05-25 23:56:44 short some stocks with me, gambling fren
40 2019-05-25 23:56:07 Bitcoin! Stocks and real estate are important too!
41 2019-05-25 23:54:56 my dad doesn’t have any debt, doesn’t spend money on things like giant houses & super nice cars and rather invests his money into us and real estate, also stocks & bonds etc.
42 2019-05-25 23:54:17 Noted. But how do you handle money made on stocks?
43 2019-05-25 23:52:54 على العلج التركي اللهم عجل بزوال أردوغان
44 2019-05-25 23:51:57 Mais heureusement que vous existez ça me permet de refourguer les stocks tout en faisant plaisir a la mom 
45 2019-05-25 23:51:25 Also Stocks and Blondes!
46 2019-05-25 23:50:47 The contrary. My portfolio is comprised of growth stocks, my point is everybody is a genius in a bull market, hence questioning the praise of picking winners and beating an index (e.g. S&P). At the same time respecting portfolio managers/HF's - throwing stones at glass housesetc.
47 2019-05-25 23:50:40 Bro I just took 8 stocks in a crew battle, I was popping off so hard. Was great
48 2019-05-25 23:50:10 beautiful!
49 2019-05-25 23:48:56 good start!
50 2019-05-25 23:47:09 When things are “good” or when my stocks are “down” it’s because the sun rose and the new day dawned. Not because of a jackass or his choir.
51 2019-05-25 23:41:23 The Trump economy is basically an extension of the Obama economy.Stocks rose more under Obama, unemployment dropped more with Obama. Trump cultists were too busy hating the black  president to experience the successes . TheirMAGAdunce caps were on too snug.
52 2019-05-25 23:40:24 I need to get into robinhood i have it set up but haven’t drop money on certain stocks yet
53 2019-05-25 23:39:23 Should be put in stocks for a month. Waste of cognac. Guy smilies cronie. Meh.!!
54 2019-05-25 23:38:56 I mean they're not wrong but isn't part of the problem that they view fewer consenting partners as "decreased shares"?

I mean my god they're humans not stocks 
55 2019-05-25 23:37:23 I be playing small ball right with stocks after a flop I just took with a biotech stock but forex I’m nowhere near ready yet lol
