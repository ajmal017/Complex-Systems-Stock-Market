39 2018-08-16 23:39:12 I thought it was very strange that, with the DOW up 440 points and all indices green, all the stocks we normally trade (GOOGL, AMZN, etc.) remained flat to down all day. Just seemed a little weird.

43 2018-08-16 23:34:50 I own stocks.  Am i now in the top 10%? I make far less than my wife who earned 2x what i did last year. 
She has a very good pension with stocks in it.
44 2018-08-16 23:32:07 Yes. Big mega churches especially, they own rental properties, stocks, businesses that barely qualify as non-profits. They donate to political parties, lobby them for special favors and engage in spreading political propaganda. That's only a few things.
45 2018-08-16 23:31:40 To the exols in this hashtag, you're all a bunch of idiots. What are they supposed to stream huh? I guarantee you they don't give a shit about us or Exo. They just want more views. You want to be laughing stocks? Go right ahead.

47 2018-08-16 23:30:20 You also think you're the only one who knows how to trade.  I built my position on bid I didn't need more shares but I wanted to watch something get some decent action today.  It's called angry slapping, jackass.
48 2018-08-16 23:29:48 @ahamilton786 the best performing stocks have historically been small cap value. Growth won't outperform for forever.
49 2018-08-16 23:29:20 You're in there pumping on down days so when the ask gets hit you can sell into the other people in the group.  Your trading is your own.  That's not how we do things in there.

I absolutely believe you have a core.  We don't trade stocks with potential, we hold.
50 2018-08-16 23:28:02 You actually can short pennies.  MMs do it all the time and so does retail.  Doesn't matter though I don't think that's what you're doing, you're just letting the MM's cover while you sit there 10 ticks under the bid until you get filled, then selling around a core of frees.
51 2018-08-16 23:28:00 My performance actually improved as soon as I started ignoring "The Big Picture", and started just paying attention to my stocks, whether they were leaders or not.

55 2018-08-16 23:25:08 If your focus is MJ stocks and the other stuff is just other stuff to balance the portfolio, but not really your primary focus, then maybe consider some ETF's instead and not worry about them as much (assuming you are worried about them)

59 2018-08-16 23:19:44 I thought today about how I would feel if someone put a bullet through Donald Trump's head.  Relieved, happy, sad, concerned, worried (about my stocks), jubilant, guilty, what?  Then I realized I just don't give a fuck, about him.  I would be concerned for the assassin's family.

61 2018-08-16 23:16:20 I’m reasonable sure (based on language used and timing) that certain biotech execs use aliases on Twitter and message boards to promote their stocks and agitate against critics. Hard to prove.
62 2018-08-16 23:16:05 I’m hoping the charting helps.  I do mostly on gut and seem to luck into some $$$ now and then lol.  I plan on doing this full time in 4 years so loading up the toolbox now! I’ve done options and stocks 16 years but never much day trading.  I love the juice of it tho!

67 2018-08-16 23:12:42 ETF administrator creates shares as demanded by authorized participants (AP's) and then has to buy #gold mining stocks (unless total return swaps, but then counterparty has to hedge). So question is who is selling all those miners, and who is buying all those ETF.

73 2018-08-16 23:07:39 I appreciate the advice. I live by a strict 40-40-20 rule... 40 for necessities, 40 for savings, 20 to spend. Whatever’s leftover by next paycheck gets dumped into stocks. I also am working several side projects and doing freelance work
74 2018-08-16 23:06:47 US stocks rebounded o/n with the Dow posting its biggest % gain in over 4 months, as positive earnings & waning trade jitters buoyed investor confidence. Despite +tive lead, local SPI futures are 2 points lower at 6,280.
75 2018-08-16 23:06:43 I never worry about the effect a rod&line angler would have on stocks, I’d be more concerned with the latest report on the effects of plastic, pollution, drift netting and climate change, they are the real threat.

I believe smart money is accumulating here.  I know they are buying select gold stocks.
93 2018-08-16 22:49:52 Love the Iran, Turkey, and Venezuela=crypto is future posts. If your government fucked your money, buy unregulated heavy manipulated extremely volatile penny stocks to avoid inflation. 

Crypto is a good start, but more like a PalmPilot than the future.
94 2018-08-16 22:47:57 Of the $58 BILLION we gave them for the bailout which they used to buy back stocks and build Buicks, for the American market, in China...?? Cry me a river..... wait till he slaps a 20% tariff on the American brands built in Canada and Mexico too... think they might come back??

102 2018-08-16 22:42:35 "The key for most investors is fixing their beta asset allocation, not trading the market well. The trick is to figure out what proportion of stocks, bonds, and commodities to hold such that a static portfolio is reliable."

103 2018-08-16 22:41:26 However the massive tax cuts for the large corporations are permanent. The GDP is going to go up because the rich and owners of corporations don’t have to worry about hiding so much of their money anymore. They can flood it into their stocks which in turn makes them more money.

107 2018-08-16 22:39:19 In your defence, you not knowing isn't the worst example with him. I did an Accounting and Corporate Finance degree, and when I gave him as an example in class of someone famous for speculating with currency/stocks and shares I had to explain who he was to the tutor
108 2018-08-16 22:38:13 Nordstrom $JWN said it earned $162 million or 95 cents a share, on sales of $4.07 billion in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed by @FactSet expected earnings of 86 cents a share on sales of $3.97 billion for the three-month period. #Finance #Money #Business #Stocks
109 2018-08-16 22:37:30 No, but I am going to guess that there is a huge resupply effort going on to get businesses restocked in Lombok as everything being bought from shops etc has run down stocks
110 2018-08-16 22:37:08 Because short term gains last forever, right? That’s why stocks never go down, companies never downsize, and workers are never laid off so investors don’t lose money.
“A rising tide lifts all boats” only works if everyone has a boat.

120 2018-08-16 22:33:38 If the expected return of cash today is about the same as most 10-year forecasts for stocks and bonds, then doesn’t it make sense to own more cash? 
121 2018-08-16 22:32:40 Well weed ETFs and individual stocks. Unsystematic risks and all...

134 2018-08-16 22:26:46 It’s an interesting move for them … since a big part of their messaging has been “don’t play with stocks”.

FWIW I’ve used the service for investing in funds and it’s *so* much nicer than any other I’ve used.
135 2018-08-16 22:24:53 Tried to trade traditional stocks for the first time today and I didn’t realize my account would get audited in order to trade options
136 2018-08-16 22:24:23 I'm having a warm time with this stock. JSE needs to review that 30% and allow investors to buy stocks up to 50%. How can my bid be halted for 2 days?
137 2018-08-16 22:23:48 It's upsetting but pls don't blame the seller. There are other variables why this happened (1) Supplier false info (2) BH limited stocks. If people check twt some shops had to cancel their GOs due to the limit and how hard it was to order ++

147 2018-08-16 22:15:42 4 weeks? Nah..try months. But this isn't a "who has the largest dick" contest. You went out of your way to harm a group and then insulted them. Then you tried to make yourself a hero by being on the bid. Wouldn't surprise me if you shorted.

181 2018-08-16 21:44:41 You'll get the hang of the Rank. On that particular podcast I didn't include the Rank in those stocks. MercadoLibre is a 5 (Strong Sell) right now. The Rank is only a short term recommendation as well. 1 to 3 months. It's not as good for long term investors.
182 2018-08-16 21:44:11 I love film stocks that intentionally fuck with gamut through unexpected light sensitivity and die couplings. I wish there were more of them since it's something that digital can't easily touch.

The original quote sure sounds like he means AFTER. He talks about it being easy to find early successful stocks in bull or bear markets and then discusses the deviation between the guys that make big money versus guys who don't. That sounds like AFTER.

392 2018-08-16 19:35:59 Morningstar style, if I recall, is that if it's a stand alone noun, it's small caps. But if it's a descriptor, it's (e.g.) small-cap stocks. I think.
393 2018-08-16 19:35:51 The funds rotated into the FAANG stocks - makes you wonder in 10 years if they’ll follow GEs path down..
394 2018-08-16 19:35:27  I have a few stocks that are a complete embarrassment.
395 2018-08-16 19:34:53 I’m buying all the stocks

402 2018-08-16 19:32:59 The Calcutta guys are also holding rising stocks on Facebook
403 2018-08-16 19:32:44 It could be a simple rotation and it could also be short- or medium-term tops w/ more upside to come later in the bull. It is hard to say. It is important to recognize that stocks often top when the news is good, so i would not focus on the stories as much as the price action
404 2018-08-16 19:31:57 Keeping capital tight in the trading act while I close on 1 house and sell another.  Upped bonds to 55% of 401k and dropped stocks to a mere 3%.  Rest in a 2% money mkt

410 2018-08-16 19:30:08 What about wages? Inflation? How my DOLLAR is worth less today than it was a year ago. Tweet about how my pathetic ins just went up $200/mo because you sabotaged the system. The lower/middle class is doing POORER this year than last. Stocks , who cares. I gotta buy groceries.
411 2018-08-16 19:28:59 For UK stocks, with chaotic supply chains, one word: hammered.

412 2018-08-16 19:28:26 Hmm interesting action happening for sure..but what catalyst?
413 2018-08-16 19:28:24 U should follow all strikes because all workers are fighting for a livable wage. You clearly don’t realize that the media  doesn’t cover strikes like they do the muller investigation because they are thriving under the stays quo. They own the stocks and get the advertising $

427 2018-08-16 19:23:11 Getting stocks is like paying for sex.

You're essentially buying someone's company.
428 2018-08-16 19:22:24 Well that’s how it works, they will go to the usd dollar first then the collapse happens. We can see a huge run up in stocks and the usd in the meantime 
429 2018-08-16 19:21:30 My 5 year plan??? Not to be in this 3D ghetto. No, I don't want to buy stocks and bonds. No, I don't want to buy a house. NO, I don't want to contrib to a 401K. I am leaving this dimension, understand? LOL #ThingsIdontSayOutLoud
430 2018-08-16 19:21:20 If the banks don’t have capital to back there loans and the predatory lends start to default the market will collapse. It’s a fact! Now compound that with over valued stocks. Recipe for disaster.
431 2018-08-16 19:20:44 There will be a sympathy play on these stocks especially after seeing $JMU Run today most likely will be a low float china play tomorrow!
432 2018-08-16 19:20:39 We will have health care for all. Living wage. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Legalize marijuana nationwide. Fund schools to adequately educate our children. Pay teachers fairly. Build bridges not wallls. Who’s in???

434 2018-08-16 19:17:35 hey quick idea i just got, since people are somewhat done with smash 4 and are getting ready to move on to ultimate, why don't the remaining tournaments for smash 4 become 3 stocks instead of 2 (at least at a weekly level) in order to prepare for ultimate

438 2018-08-16 19:13:25 Perhaps its time for wealth taxation.  If you have nothing, you pay nothing.  The more you have, the more you pay, whether its considered income or capital (cash, stocks, land, art, buildings, whatever).  We could also also what US does & tax all Canadians, resident or ex-pat.
439 2018-08-16 19:12:03 VLS has up to 20,000 stocks, that’s quite diversified?
440 2018-08-16 19:11:53 De acuerdo, los precios subidos son la propia inflación. Los precios de stocks, casas, matriculas educativas, servicios médicos, un BigMac, un ticket de cine, etc en el tope histórico pero me dices que no hay inflación.

442 2018-08-16 19:11:42 Inverse of a pattern I often see in small-cap biotech stocks- the majority of my holdings- high volume burst slaps bid down, & then they stuff the ask on or above the moving average. They guide it down a technical downtrend & wait for retail to sell & then cover on the bid.
443 2018-08-16 19:11:31 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
444 2018-08-16 19:11:27 Who could probably take down the full might of the US! I've quitupled my investment in a little over a year. Not even my apple or Tesla stocks have come close to that.

450 2018-08-16 19:07:50 emotional investment is just important as financial investment though. think about it like that? as humans it’s what we have to do to build up to what our purpose is. the stocks don’t always play out in your favor but you’ll always learn something from it and be better next time
451 2018-08-16 19:07:08 Stop falling for trash #INVEST your money. Patience pays in this game... it’s the only way. Chasing mainstream pumps is only profitable to those pushing them. Solid stocks that set the path to success are the future.
452 2018-08-16 19:07:03 Exactly right.  It's especially hard to maintain MM coverage in thinly traded stocks.  I think an issuer is right to consider where the tipping point is, and whether or not they want to be the guinea pig.

463 2018-08-16 18:58:52 You have to add up the years to get the super huge declines. That's not what people argue. They argue we'll get a "crash" and suddenly stocks will be down 50%+. It has NEVER happened in the last 100 years and certainly not without some huge financial event.

466 2018-08-16 18:56:56 A 400 point surge in the Dow and a 1 bp rise in the 10-year T-note yield don’t typically go hand-in-hand. The stocks moving are the ones that respond to “trade” news plus WMT, which is benefiting from blowout food-related revenues (over half comes from food and staples).

480 2018-08-16 18:47:23 Seems likely that most middle class people don't have a lot of discretionary income to buy stocks.  Stock buybacks favor the wealthy.  Also makes the CEO s look good as their income is often partially based in stock options

490 2018-08-16 18:40:53 I tweeted this previously. Look for when the U.S. negotiators meet again with China. Bashing Chinese stocks yesterday on networks while going into backdoor trade talks. Both sides are beginning to feel the heat as tariffs if left unchecked will wreck the economy. A time to buy?
491 2018-08-16 18:40:40 I'm getting tired of hearing about how stocks could suddenly collapse over 50%. In 2008 apocalypse, $QQQ down 40%. $SPY down 38.5%.
492 2018-08-16 18:40:07 That's a 750% return. Can't get that with stocks and bonds.
493 2018-08-16 18:39:11 China's pain is a U.S. gain. Cheap food and energy will supercharge the U.S. economy. The only stocks to lose will be those that have built their fortunes by undermining the U.S. and their destruction will be a blessing for all americans.

522 2018-08-16 18:29:57 Any mention that stocks are increasing because EU quotas stopped those same 'British' fishermen wiping everything out
523 2018-08-16 18:29:47 $FANG stocks look like shit

As for Merch, you see people wearing watches? I did that. 1% of every watch sold since 1870 is invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks and shares. Who do you think funds Elon?
529 2018-08-16 18:27:37 Dow remain up well above 430 points, despite dollar strengthening. This to me shows that the market is either heavily deluded, or "some mysterious entity" is buying up stocks to keep the MYTH of a solid economy running. What a joke.
530 2018-08-16 18:27:27 Made a cool $77 in stocks. Thinking of becoming an angel investor
531 2018-08-16 18:27:00 Índices de inflación tienen solo ciertos precios de economía de EEUU. Cuando hay otros que crecen sin parar como la atención en salud, las universidades privadas las casas, los stocks del NASDAQ. Así mismo ahora EEUU es más caro que hace 10 años y 2008 seguro más caro que 1998.
532 2018-08-16 18:26:15 FANG stocks taking out LODs. $DIA not giving up much. Still think this 400 pt rally is being held up by air. $SPY volume is light.

THANKS TO JOBS AND THE ECONOMY.
535 2018-08-16 18:22:48 They’re more or less overrated by definition, but like stocks or tokens you can always find undervalued content creators and learn from them or leverage them as a business
536 2018-08-16 18:22:45 Mmm see that’s the thing. I don’t believe in the company long term, but they just got $250 mill from some investor and their stocks are so cheap.. I feel like it has to go up soon for a little bit at least
537 2018-08-16 18:21:43 Looking forward to end of the year when I can look back on the ups and downs of $CELZ and be happy I did all my DD and held strong. This is one of those stocks that is going to take off and all the flippers that got scared out start will regret they didn’t look at the big picture
538 2018-08-16 18:21:18 UK Market Close: Hopes of breakthrough in China-US talks boost stocks
539 2018-08-16 18:21:04 That is my conclusion.  Seems a chronic u/p. IBD buys too late. And,the stocks are too well known.  Often,their buy occurs after the stock has been up 6-7days in a row ( or 7/ 9 days). Or,it has to move 10% to hit the pivot. Lately, seems like day trades are the only way to make$
540 2018-08-16 18:19:33 @trish_regan  Trish great spot w/ Gartman but countries need to maintain a manufacturing base we cannot sell each other insurance products, mortgages, stocks and maintain a viable economy we have to create real value thru manufacturing Gartman types ignore this
541 2018-08-16 18:18:33 C'est parce que les stocks sont hyper mal gérés et sous-estimés ? Ou parce que le jeu s'est vraiment super bien vendu ?
542 2018-08-16 18:18:28 Better investigate Australian pot stocks.
543 2018-08-16 18:17:48 Mr wonderful O'Leary... Only buy's dividends stocks....the rest he says it all speculative!
544 2018-08-16 18:17:14 As editor I envision your job would be 95% talking about appropriate paper stocks, formats, and printing techniques, and 5% saying "do whatever the fuck you want as long as it's awesome" over and over again.
545 2018-08-16 18:17:01 I was trading stocks in my dorm room at Louisiana Tech. 

Other people graduated college then started figuring out how to invest.
546 2018-08-16 18:16:59 Thanks, for some reason, I didn't think of that. I was looking online at the lists of different stocks, but wasn't interested in those. I'm suppose the recommendations were valid, but I'm taking a Warren Buffet approach and not invest in things that I don't understand.
547 2018-08-16 18:16:45 Turkey Stocks, Lira Slide After Mnuchin Threatens More Sanctions
 
The Lira and Turkish stocks are sliding notably after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that Washington is preparing more sanctions for Turkey due to the lack of progress on the release of Pastor Brunson.
548 2018-08-16 18:15:52 It is a fakeout imo.  Hardest hit areas like gold miners, FCX, Chinese stocks, etc all fading.  Dow provides good cover for sentiment bc big numbers and Dow figures always plastered on cnbc screen
549 2018-08-16 18:14:55 Just spoke to TDAMERITRADE they do not know if they will ever trade $cxbtf. Every month they review stocks and make a determination. I am callin Etrade and Fidelity.
550 2018-08-16 18:13:39 If UBS says so.... than they are buying the stocks
551 2018-08-16 18:13:38 True, but there’s also no weather app and no stocks app on the Mac and still Siri can do that.
552 2018-08-16 18:12:51 Bring back the lime flavor and I'll boost their stocks myself.

555 2018-08-16 18:11:34 depending on what bank you use, they probably have a Discount Brokerage/Online Brokerage arm that you can use to buy individual stocks/bonds or Mutual Funds. But if you have no idea what you're doing, I'd recommend sitting down with your banker!
556 2018-08-16 18:09:55 Why wipro isn't running like other IT stocks ?
557 2018-08-16 18:09:39 If we decided to rescind limited liability, I would immediately shift my entire retirement account out of stocks. No more investing in business for me, period. I cannot imagine that I would be alone in this.
558 2018-08-16 18:09:24 No need check nbfc small cap stocks
559 2018-08-16 18:07:18 Vermont would do better to not incarcerate out of state. Reducing the number of inmates would be sufficient. To do this, change sentencing guidelines. Why do we penalize offenders with wasteful prison time? Reintroduce stocks & public flogging. Not primitive, but fast, effective.
560 2018-08-16 18:06:25 It's completely ethical to use #neuromarketing to alert visitors of a limited supply of a product to stimulate sales. Pretending that stocks are low, however, is not an ethical use of #neuroscience knowledge. Honesty remains the best marketing policy, always.
561 2018-08-16 18:05:23 I watch the new IBD 50 ETF( FFTY) . It gives clues about our types of stocks.
Its only up .28% —glaring U/P.    Several of my stocks are down.  ..Seems almost impossible.

564 2018-08-16 18:03:11 أحسن، بل ثمة شركات تقترض لتوزع أرباح على مساهميها.

565 2018-08-16 18:02:57 Quite honestly, I've never heard of the NYFANG.  I put this list together before anyone ever talked about FANG.   I was talking about most of these stocks in 2009 at the IBD Meetup meetings. (Been a couple changes. $CMG was on the list years, YEARS ago.

568 2018-08-16 18:00:55 You know who never really loses money in this country? “Defense” contractors and weapons manufacturers. It’s like investing in electricity utility stocks; no one in their right mind will ever let the power go out…you see what I did there? Lol.
569 2018-08-16 18:00:15 Algos didn’t go into them when stocks were down maybe.
570 2018-08-16 18:00:13 This rally is mostly abut the DOW. The FANG stocks are looking weak and the S&P is up, but lagging the industrials.
571 2018-08-16 17:59:04 @mattyglesias I read your article on @SenWarren’s proposal. Interesting read, and I enjoyed it. I think you mischaracterized the losers if the price of stocks decrease. It won’t be rich, but rather net-sellers of equity (the old). All net-buyers should cheer cheaper equity prices

574 2018-08-16 17:57:40 The stupidity of this. "Oh the stocks have finally recovered from overfishing,  time for us to hammer the fish stocks again"...thank god the EU stepped in to protect fisheries,  if the greedy uk had their way then it would be a dead sea with nothing left.

576 2018-08-16 17:56:58 It feels like ages. Although to be sure, the mining stocks are feeling it.

578 2018-08-16 17:55:30 Apparently now only wealthy people are allowed to buy good stocks.

580 2018-08-16 17:54:48 No edge in stocks w billion share floats. Idc what anyone says. When you can’t judge sentiment based on real quotes, it’s a coin toss.

587 2018-08-16 17:50:15 Yes. Those EU imposed regulations allowed fish stocks to recover well.
588 2018-08-16 17:49:21 Projecting. Childish: Just said same to you.  China doesn't care about its stock market. Few Chinese own stocks. Whereas US ownership reached highest since 2000 recently. China is betting on a crash in US stocks to bring it to its knees. Time will tell

594 2018-08-16 17:45:30 dogs of teh dow? isnt that related to high div rates on certain stocks?  how quaint
595 2018-08-16 17:43:44 Twitter is a liberal platform run by Muslims. They're not the smartest people on the planet. Their stocks are crashing and yet they continue their self destruction. Gab is becoming more popular in time it will take Twitter place.
596 2018-08-16 17:43:39 I agree, but the economy is only “growing” because he’s inflating a massive debt bubble.

Federal reserve prints money, loans it to banks, who loan it to Wall Street, who buys back stocks, which drive up the price of stocks.

@DynastyHHPod
610 2018-08-16 17:35:28 There’s been a rotation to defensives lately too such as utilities, healthcare and staples. The late inflationary issues such as materials, energy and even industrials are not getting that much bid. So PMs appear to be making some changes while holding their winning stocks.

612 2018-08-16 17:34:51 Short sellers are not manipulators of stocks. They are making a bet on the downside. Nothing wrong with that. They are actually a stock's best friend if the company does well as they will eventually have to cover.
613 2018-08-16 17:34:35 Download a coupon on the epipen brand website or epinephrine auto injector (whichever your insurance covers) and it’ll pick up a portion of the balance and you’ll end up only having to pay like 20 bucks rt to save a life !!!!!

615 2018-08-16 17:32:34 Yes, I agree.  I think there are some very early signs that stocks are recovering. However given slow growth rate of bass will be years before things are back on an even track.
616 2018-08-16 17:31:41 Those who appear to be selling the commodities short for a sharp decline are also selling the bonds, and neutral in stocks with longs mainly in defensive sectors and some exposure to growth, as an overall hedged strategy. PMs will not increase risk much more from here...

622 2018-08-16 17:29:18 Yes, but. Almost like more americans are falling into poverty and thus desperate for cheap groceries now or something. Same reason "dollar general" stocks are up. The middle is no more, so only real luxury and cheap instant gratification produce margins now?
623 2018-08-16 17:28:41 Bias clouds judgment. "Kudlow should warn the Trump administration not to underestimate China's determination to fight to the end... We have to be prepared for reasonable countermeasures and a protracted war, until the US gives up." They're relying on a crash in US stocks 
624 2018-08-16 17:26:32 This is a ratio compared to stocks, which are way way up   So, no. Your chart is meaningless
625 2018-08-16 17:26:20 Taxes around crypto are still unclear I think. The SEC said that they won't be treated like stocks I believe tho

638 2018-08-16 17:17:37 Anyone believe that the China rumor was floated out as a "short squeeze?" Short covering has A LOT to do with the magnitude of the upward move in stocks.  It's not like we haven't seen this before...

668 2018-08-16 16:59:44 June 1, 2016 - Obutthead says "some jobs are just not coming back, so get used to it". 

All 30 DOW stocks are green today. 
High employment means taxes are flowing in to Treasury.
669 2018-08-16 16:58:51 Market is still in correction territory. You forgot to mention that. Your policies haven’t really done much to help stocks this year. You’re a fake trump
670 2018-08-16 16:58:29 Ackman went back to what he knows best: Old fashioned great stocks. No more messing with "bad guys", no more stupid activism. truly happy for him.
671 2018-08-16 16:58:13 I kinda remember Alex coming on the scene. Seemed an ok kid. Quick success shorting Nas stocks IIRC. Dunno what he’s up to now as I’m no longer in that circle. Rock though? He 100% wasn’t a scammer. He hated that shit and often used to call scammers like Sykes out.

673 2018-08-16 16:56:59 I’m not a rich guy or even someone who has really any money at all. Still, really should of bought some @netflix stock when I had a hunch at $175/share it would blow up. Currently at $327 with a peak at $415. #stocks

676 2018-08-16 16:55:45 with a 20 PE as many consumer stocks  (none w Apple's 98% brand loyalty) AAPL be $265 on 2019 earnings.....it's the ultimate US consumer stock not a tech stock
677 2018-08-16 16:54:58 The big techs are frozen in place. So you better wait for them to confirm this rally before you overcommit on the long side. Market rallies as long as they are seen as safe haven stocks. Once they lead to the downside things could change quickly so watch them.
678 2018-08-16 16:54:55 Facebook has been one of the market’s top performing stocks in recent months, coming off the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal.

681 2018-08-16 16:53:11 I have analysed most of his stocks and none were fundamentally weak, rest entire midcap space is down so can't blame him ..
682 2018-08-16 16:52:56 Stocks with Roc >40 are recovering fast.
Past trend shows when drawdown is greater than 20 , next year return is more than 35%
683 2018-08-16 16:52:18 #Turkish media are in full propaganda mode against the United State saying that US stocks tumble, lira surges as #Turkey hits back with tariffs.. because of a dictator from Qatar through in $15 Billion to shore up #TurkishLira @realDonaldTrump @VP @UzayB @PinarTremblay
684 2018-08-16 16:51:47 You know I like to call it a "dead dog bounce" because the dipshit who created the term never loved and lost a cat...Like so many market analysts out there who don't own stocks...but I digress.
I AGREE about the market tho, Chef.

685 2018-08-16 16:51:41 Trump is ok with anything remotely economic as long as stocks are high enough. If he sees $ as a threat, he'll happily talk it down, a flipper in chief, no less.
686 2018-08-16 16:51:30 I'm finally making money in the stock market! 0 gains under Obama for 8 years. Some of my stocks are up 92%. Thank you President Donald Trump! Vote conservative 2018!

691 2018-08-16 16:46:53 Don't trade them, so don't waste time looking at them.  I believe that China will eventually have problems as their lack of freedoms will come back to haunt them and their people. The tech stocks in China will likely suffer that as well.
692 2018-08-16 16:46:40 What's this f*ing fixation over Tesla? You don't have other stocks to short? Maybe other good short recommendations in the energy/oil sector?   Sick and tired of the same trade.

716 2018-08-16 16:37:41 Penny stock promoters used to send me piles of glossy mailers. I do not miss those things; they cluttered up my mailbox. Crafty promoters now resort to message boards and social media to pump their favorite no-chance penny stocks. Walk away, investors.
717 2018-08-16 16:36:49 Hi Tweeps! A solid uplift in stocks on Wall Street today! On other fronts I notice Twitter have purged a few of my followers! I guess they must have their reasons but I've no idea why! Off with Marishka to the #BBCProms tonight - Stravinsky, Ravel and Debussy - should be good!
718 2018-08-16 16:36:07 Whoever says stock market is a "Zero sum game" has never invested, but gambled in stocks. They view stocks as lottery tickets instead of part ownership in a business. #InvestRationally #ValueInvesting
719 2018-08-16 16:35:22 Dow now up more than 400 points. All 30 stocks are up. Strong earnings from $CSCO and $WMT helping. China fears receding a bit too and that's helping $AAPL $BA $CAT.

726 2018-08-16 16:31:53 One of my first lessons, covering telecom stocks like WorldCom and Qwest Communications in 2002, was that stocks don't start in the low single digits. But they can end up there and tend not to recover.
727 2018-08-16 16:31:14 Investing is my side job..ive only ever invested in 10 stocks and i made 8 great trades and 2 poor. Look up $rst which i purchased in 2009
728 2018-08-16 16:31:02 Most pot stocks are fully marginable at National Bank. Same with RBC and BMO but they will cap your margin if sector concentration (nat bank will never do that)

731 2018-08-16 16:29:34 Capital gains taxes isn’t a loophole. It’s a different kind of tax for investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate. That money is an investment in the economy, so to tax it higher hurts the economy. If you’re a fan of that idea then by all means keep doing you.
732 2018-08-16 16:29:02 $OSTK Patrick stocks down from $48 to $30 in a couple days. If you dont mind me asking: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
@CNBCFastMoney @CNBC
733 2018-08-16 16:28:45 I got a $450k margin call in Feb when BMO suddenly changed margin rules & reduced buying power if using potstocks as collateral. I covered by selling stocks & had to pay huge capital gains. In July I transferred to a new broker who gave back my full margin. Now I regret covering.

748 2018-08-16 16:24:02 stocks took some losses yesterday and bonds were not able to take advantage and move better. Today, stocks are rallying better, but bonds are holding their ground and not moving worse. So it seems bonds are pretty dug in at current pricing levels.

774 2018-08-16 16:12:26 imports tend to fall though during TAs and product stocks should see nice draws.  looks fairly balanced out forward across crude and products
775 2018-08-16 16:11:58 As I said before that’s a fantasy. The Obama economy was stagnant by the time he left office. The GDP has hit records as well as DOW and stocks, all after Trump took office. This economy was not inherited but given an environment to thrive it grew.
776 2018-08-16 16:11:28 You will do better in real estate than in stocks
777 2018-08-16 16:10:14 He inherited nothing. The GDP, stocks, and overall economy only exponentially grew after Trump took office. He didn’t wave a wand like Obama and his pen, he actually got to work and did his job. Maybe Democrats could learn something from him.

779 2018-08-16 16:10:07 Feeling stupid for not just borrowing as much as I can and just buy stocks. Central bank free money forever, buybacks, short VIX. Why should anyone work with suppressed wages, when central banks pay you via stock market for free?

781 2018-08-16 16:09:55 I know you are being sarcastic but successful stock picking ability is an extremely rare skill. Therefore the fourth method is not bad. Obviously you need to do your own work but it is a good place to start if at all you are going to pick stocks. Otherwise stick to index funds.

785 2018-08-16 16:06:19 This year, the market has been somewhat flat. The Dow & S&P peaked in January, and have been sideways since then. The Russell made new highs and the NASDAQ  is hovering at new highs. Overall, the market still bullish, with individual stocks are doing fairly well.

790 2018-08-16 16:04:02 Selective gains at 71.786 on the USDINR is a barrier n one can expect a good reaction from there.Not all stocks are likely to do good as selective play pans out in stocks.The best plays are in the indices Nifty n BankNifty.Esp Options.

794 2018-08-16 16:02:33 US won all the wars - big reason USD is now the global standard. 

With respect to gold:
1. It's not easy to transfer gold cross borders.
2. It's can be, and has been, censored.
3. Gold stocks are not easily verified, leading to distrust of controlling entity.

814 2018-08-16 15:51:31 I know a foreign fund manager living in Shanghai who invests only in mall stocks, because he can at least walk around, see the traffic, and talk to the shopkeepers.
815 2018-08-16 15:51:19 @PatrickWalker56 hi Patrick do you trade stocks that are less expensive than the ones that you show?
Stocks that a new trader like myself could afford and I dont mean penny stocks. Thank you
816 2018-08-16 15:50:47 They are less riskier than stocks unless you have a large sum of $ you’re ready to risk. If you’re looking for quick returns and a way to build your $ I would look into those. The last thing is to create an account on site like ‘Morningstar’ or ‘Fidelity’
817 2018-08-16 15:50:40 The S&P retailers index (.SPXRT) gained 0.63 percent. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology stocks (.SPLRCT) up 0.79 percent.

821 2018-08-16 15:48:16 The first thing I would suggest is to do your research on whatever it is you’re thinking about investing your $ into. Second I would actually suggest looking into what is called ETF’s or mutual funds. It’s kind of like a pool of a bunch of stocks mixed together.

835 2018-08-16 15:42:52 Agreed....

No matter how diverse the fund itself is, the investment portfolio isn't diverse if 1 fund. 

Read an Sunday paper article recently where an investor was encouraged to sell a portfolio of funds and put it all into one fund. 

Loss of diversification not mentioned.

838 2018-08-16 15:41:21 Na, one of my game plans is to do the corporate thing for maybe 20 years. Get high enough to put away enough to never worry about $ again. Start some kind of small business like a boutique or ice cream shop or somn to stay busy. Live off dividends from stocks/real estate.
839 2018-08-16 15:41:21 Fundamental things investors are ignoring (unwisely,  IMO. 
1. Housing data.

3. BTC Bear mkt effects on Semiconductors, and those stocks (weak) 
4. Poor wage growth and effects on consumers fighting inflation. 
5. Long term trade policy direction.

881 2018-08-16 15:24:41 I prefer options on higher priced stocks since a 1% move on a $100 stock is a $1 move vs a 1% move on a $30 stock is only a 30 cent move. After comms, b/a slipg on both sides & delta giving only a % of gains, it can b hard to profit in short term on options on low priced stocks.

898 2018-08-16 15:18:50 Inflation is not low!  The #GOPTaxScam only benefited the rich & corporations!  Corporations have not pass on their tax savings to their employees!  Instead they are buying back their stocks to enrich themselves even more.  The Trump economy doesn't work for the middleclass!

914 2018-08-16 15:15:06 If business stocks are doing so well, why did the majority of the market dump them yesterday for utility stocks, which are normally safe havens for turbulent times in the financial world? Simple google searches prove your statements as either false or misleading. Sorry try harder
915 2018-08-16 15:15:02 Interesting, thanks!  If so, once we add in that those 10% get a significant % of their wealth from rising stocks, we can infer once again that the US stock market increasingly is the US economy...

5) stronger rally

1010 2018-08-16 14:35:19 Agreed! You'll also see that many big corporations are using their tax cuts to buy stocks back, which benefits the wealthiest at the top instead of allowing that money to go towards the employees at the mid and lower levels, exacerbating income inequality.

1039 2018-08-16 14:24:10 I still haven't really gotten into options trading.. but I buy stocks when they dip and I expect them to go up and they usually do which I assume would be translate somewhat to success with them. I just still need to learn more about it.

1044 2018-08-16 14:23:15 I know how stocks work but hadn't noticed how inconsistent that is with property law, and so, like the SCOTUS majority in Citizens United, I mischaracterized stockholders as owners. This guy Ciepley lays it out very clearly, check it out.

1063 2018-08-16 14:13:21 Rich, big companies are buying back stocks like crazy, because of your tax cut for the 1%. No new jobs. The population is not winning. There is no optimism, other than counting on Mr. Mueller to prove you are the corrupt and illegitimate President.
1064 2018-08-16 14:13:06 @Helper when was the last time US stocks fell 75% in a single yr? Or even over 2 years? Lol. Has NEVER happened. Not even Great Depression.
1065 2018-08-16 14:12:48 There is another factor to take into account. Stocks imminent crash. Last year stocks were doing great so many people were risking more on crypto. If stocks and metals fall, I doubt people will buy magic beans on Binance when their portfolios vanish like $HMNY. "Bear mode ON"

1074 2018-08-16 14:08:18 Those who shorted the stock at 380 are doing great. But even those who shorted a few years ago are fine. Unlike other stocks, Tesla didn't make new highs in a recent year.

1076 2018-08-16 14:07:35 It's more like 2004-05. Only the problem is much worse. Housing is higher, stocks are higher, and U.S. bonds are higher with three times as much out there. If in a crisis the market demands 10% to buy t-bills, the federal government is pretty much bankrupt.

1152 2018-08-16 13:42:21 Very true.  Large corporations are NOT reinvesting their huge “savings” back into the economy - no surprise. They are pursuing acquisitions & mergers  & buying back stocks. Wages & salaries remain flatlined.

1154 2018-08-16 13:41:34 So it really shouldn't be called "inflation" since it's not money, yet. It's a confusing term. Crypto has dropped in value like stocks did in 2008. No inflation involved. Once a digital asset is used as money, price inflation/deflation can be calculated. Until then, it's nonsense

1180 2018-08-16 13:30:47 Snowman is in my long term portfolio.means at least for 5 years.
I'm zero in fundamentals.
First time I bought at 51 n sold half at 63 n rest 68.
I enter again at 49,44, 47.
Sold some at 48 as well. So I play with stocks.if u not comfortable माह ur position size is large.Cont. 2
1181 2018-08-16 13:30:43 Fundamentally, games are a stupid thing to invest in. Buy to play. Buy to collect if you must. But if you want to invest, go buy actual investments like stocks or bonds or gold or whatever.
1182 2018-08-16 13:27:45 What tube stocks have you got in it? Have you got Northern line 1995 stock? Over 55% of the underground network is actually overground and most of the sub surface lines are mainly above ground, even in zone 1 (esp. the District line).

1186 2018-08-16 13:27:19 #eurusd critical week. The last time we close under 200weeks SMA was Oct2017. Which is now sitting at 1.1355. Weekly close below that is deadly for EUR. #TurkishLira #Economic #stocks #Bond #debt #crash #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
1187 2018-08-16 13:27:16 That is all economic propaganda. Inflation is low but wages are lower.  Stocks are stagnant.  Businesses are closing and your stupid tariffs will soon make everything worse.  You have done nothing to improve life for the working man.  All that is good is a continuation of Obama.

1194 2018-08-16 13:25:29 Hey Aljo, usually recommendations are based on what you want , or what you are comfortable with. There are stocks that will give you higher yields that are usually more risky, or you can go safer bluechips with dividends. Depends on your risk tolerance.
1195 2018-08-16 13:23:27 Well,,, their stocks just had a 250-1 reverse split last week and now their shares have been so low you can’t buy them anyone on sites like Robinhood. The end is near

1197 2018-08-16 13:21:55 If we are to go by economically sensitive commodities such as Copper, stocks could drop a LOT more than this. The charts are clear here… the global growth story is over.
1198 2018-08-16 13:21:23 90% of the stocks that make it to 90 will make it to 100
1199 2018-08-16 13:21:16 On twitter no stock is being bought or in your portfolio. Always the disclosure is no! I guess anonymously you cant buy the stocks that's why and for real Mr Arora you can't say!

1201 2018-08-16 13:21:09 Our goods always cost more - bcz they were better quality, consistent, & readily available across globe.

1203 2018-08-16 13:20:10 Avoid those mutha fuckin’ penny stocks. Robert R. Johnson, president and CEO of the American College of Financial Services says: "Small-market capitalization companies, with very high volatility, and poor liquidity." 
You’ll lose your shit.
1204 2018-08-16 13:19:35 Interesting charts, thanks. I don’t disagree with the risks for the downside. But keeping in mind capital flows, and the pattern expressing in US stocks broad indices versus others, I also don’t rule out prices doing something other than breaking support; watch levels carefully.
1205 2018-08-16 13:19:27 No probs, I don't think any seasoned investor on here believes anything BMD or Tom Winnipoo say as they are equally as bigger frauds than the companies they are accusing of fraud. Its abit like Justin the clown at @VOXmarkets, guy talks up his own stocks without downside.

1212 2018-08-16 13:16:48 $IQ doesn't really have a recent catalyst but like most of the Chinese stocks it has been beaten down hard over the last couple days and appears likely to bounce now. I like it long near the $26.40 pivot for a push up to $27.75/$28 resistance zone.

1243 2018-08-16 12:57:00 I swing Stocks long mainly, but will short the indexes intraday.  The environment is not very good for my type of swings currently so I did nothing there.  Big trend still up but the day was hard down. Bad combo. So wait. Now big gap up. So wait. Wait for the obvious trade.
1244 2018-08-16 12:56:53 Company earnings are up, this is true but only because of your tax raping of the middle class allowing the rich to buy back stocks giving a false upsurge to the economy. The rest of this is complete BS.
1245 2018-08-16 12:56:46 like 1929 economy and the stock market experienced rapid expansion, and stocks hit record highs. there was a rapid growth in bank credit and easily acquired loans.

1260 2018-08-16 12:48:32 I think the situation is more related to "Hey lets just reap some profits here and buy lower, using Turkey as a catalyst." More so than "Turkey is having a global impact on stocks everywhere."
1261 2018-08-16 12:48:31 There is a very simple explanation for this bitcoin rout. Bitcoin is always a bet on risk. When the financial markets are calm and steady, investors look for alternative risky investments for returns. But now you can get exposed to risks in stocks. Who needs cryptocurrencies?
1262 2018-08-16 12:48:25 An F because only the richest ppl are benefiting from his tax breaks. NOT the average/lower wage workers!

1292 2018-08-16 12:33:55 @AOTtrades today looks like a prime day for the Asian stocks. $JD posted bad numbers and initially traded lower pre-market and is now up 2%.
1293 2018-08-16 12:33:43 unrelated. but wwe has been public since post AE. it's they they have sponcers and stocks now
1294 2018-08-16 12:33:14 $SPY With stocks poised to open higher, some now want a pullback. That was yesterday. Easy to say you want it, more difficult to act upon it
1295 2018-08-16 12:30:42 I opened an Okrika business with the little savings i could get from my Nysc allawee, it's just online for now, i want to open a shop and buy mannequins and some more stocks for it...I'll make roughly 50k monthly, as time goes on i plan on adding bags to it.
1296 2018-08-16 12:30:22 In analyzing whether US stocks will continue to outperform their international peers (they will), remember that the US finds itself on the sunny side of the two major themes driving #markets for now: economic divergence and financial dispersion

1303 2018-08-16 12:26:05 बाधाएँ आती हैं आएँ,
घिरें प्रलय की घोर घटाएँ,
पावों के नीचे अंगारे,
सिर पर बरसें यदि ज्वालाएँ,
निज हाथों में हँसते-हँसते,
आग लगाकर जलना होगा।
क़दम मिलाकर चलना होगा।

1309 2018-08-16 12:23:06 $Weed stock moved by the pound yesterday. Today it might move by the half oz due to this legit drug dealer kingpin making almost every 6 o clock news report in #toronto.  #Stocks #Highonlife #MoMoney #toeasy
1310 2018-08-16 12:21:39 Probably wise, as what gets cheap can always get cheaper. I have a list of stocks that I like fundamentally, but not entering until I get the right setup.
1311 2018-08-16 12:21:38 Why is it artificial? Stocks are not overvalued on an after-tax DCF basis.
1312 2018-08-16 12:21:14 If you search $EA you can see a bunch of nerd shit that'll show you graphs and stocks and whatever for @EA's stock value, but if you play video games it's pretty easy to see that you'll lose money by investing in EA. You don't need fancy graphs for that.

1325 2018-08-16 12:15:49 In reality, Donald Trump is an outsider & sincerely, a businessman. Like in any business, stocks go up, down & back up again. Though, in reality, Obama & his Liberals drew Americans into a $21 trillion debt. More than any other President Combined in 8 years alone, a total scam.

1343 2018-08-16 12:03:56 Got it. Other thing is that the money that "comes back" will be invested, not spent - which means that asset prices, like stocks, real estate, etc will just go up. It's pretty much a lose-lose.
1344 2018-08-16 12:03:30 I got killed in broker fees too. I'm just going to pick decent stocks at a certain price and leave it at that. Topping up and buying more just makes banks richer.

1363 2018-08-16 11:52:24 One of the reasons why I didn't sell as much as I wanted to in January was due to the fact that I felt trapped.

1452 2018-08-16 10:42:55 The momentum of the market pre’97 entered a speculative zone where stocks became the cure all for wealth accumulation. The unraveling of this delusion will be the most painful since the ‘30,imo. The persistence at these levels has numbed risk control.
1453 2018-08-16 10:40:29 I think they know permits will arrive so not matter of “if” bidding to start any moment

1456 2018-08-16 10:39:24 Yes that can happen. Some type of business can have an extraordinary moment and record enormous growth during a period of time and that would have positive impact on the money invested. Ex: That happened with bitcoin and for some good stocks in the past especially in techn sector

1468 2018-08-16 10:26:37 Just an general idea about 200+ f&0 stocks, what is the max position without much slippage
1469 2018-08-16 10:26:36 HAHAHAHA TOLD YOU. THATS THE UPGRADE I TALK ABOUT. ITS A HUGE PAIN BECAUSE YOU NEED TO THINK AND MANAGE YOUR STOCKS and theyre not always so conveniently lying around too ugh i think you can pick up arrows but after you upgrade the skills :/

1471 2018-08-16 10:25:03 The Dow Industrial tripled, from a low of ~6k under Obama to 18k (eroded a bit by the uncertainty of the election year).  As Trump enacted tax cuts and deregulation, stocks initially rose to over 26k, but this year that's weakened, threatening to fall below 25k.

1473 2018-08-16 10:24:52 Sorry, I meant for f&o stocks
1474 2018-08-16 10:24:27 For handful of stocks, it’s very high. But don’t think it is very high for rest of them. But good part being, every stock is bought with intention of holding 10 years. It makes process foolproof.
1475 2018-08-16 10:24:23 No no.
Falling stocks are hold only by you..

1493 2018-08-16 10:15:00 Barring a breathtaking plunge, the bull market in U.S. stocks on Aug. 22 will become the longest in history, and optimistic investors argue it has miles to go before it rests.  The bull market has thrived amid a decade of upheaval, thanks in part to Trump’s leadership and savvy.

1503 2018-08-16 10:08:54 Any fund raising can only done by asking the shareholders permission, as ref to last AGM

That said if more money is need a very good explanation will be given to get shareholders permission which will likely see a rise in the SP

1505 2018-08-16 10:07:53 Yes- because #Congress in their wisdom pushed corporations to pay CEOs in stock during a period when pay was going up but stocks were not. The purpose- align interest w shareholders. Unintended consequence- soaring stock prices, outrageous pay

1508 2018-08-16 10:06:34 That's good to hear. I agree that guns are a terrible problem. But as long as everything is modular, it looks like manufacturers could just keep making minor changes in each part to evade the laws. An example is the difficulty in banning "bump stocks." I wish I had your optimism.
1509 2018-08-16 10:06:08 When buying stocks, the general guide is to buy with the intention of holding for 5 years and comparing the current market price against the company's 'true' worth.

For crypto, I would assume no differently. The hardest part is managing one's emotions through this volatility.

Unfortunately, people are doubting the feasibilities of your tariffs. U.S. steel and aluminum stocks have taken major hits lately. If you can show U.S. steel and aluminum companies can start making record revenue and profits, then you can quash these doubts.

#AtalBihariVaajpayee जी को सादर नमन
1659 2018-08-16 07:41:44 दाग बड़े गहरे हैं
टूटता तिलिस्म आज सच से भय खाता हूं
गीत नहीं गाता हूं
लगी कुछ ऐसी नज़र बिखरा शीशे सा शहर
अपनों के मेले में मीत नहीं पाता हूं
गीत नहीं गाता हूं
पीठ मे छुरी सा चांद,राहू गया रेखा फांद
मुक्ति के क्षणों में बार बार बंध जाता हूं
गीत नहीं गाता हूं
~#AtalBehariVajpayee

1661 2018-08-16 07:40:08 अकबर के पुत्रोंसे पूछो क्या याद उन्हे मीना बाज़ार

क्या याद उन्हे चित्तौड़ दुर्ग मे जलनेवाली आग प्रखर

जब हाय सहस्त्रो माताएं तिल तिल कर जल कर हो गई अमर

यदि कभी अचानक फूट पडे विप्लव लेकर तो क्या विस्मय

हिन्दु तन मन हिन्दु जीवन रग रग हिन्दु मेरा परिचय

1662 2018-08-16 07:39:42 टूटे हुए सपनों की कौन सुने सिसकी
अन्तर की चीर व्यथा पलकों पर ठिठकी
हार नहीं मानूंगा, रार नहीं ठानूंगा,

काल के कपाल पे लिखता मिटाता हूं
गीत नया गाता हूं

इस पहर में सारे देश की दुआऐं आपके साथ है-आप अटल हैं #AtalBihariVajpaye
1663 2018-08-16 07:39:06 "दुनिया का इतिहास पूछता, रोम कहाँ, यूनान कहाँ है?

दीप बुझे पश्चिमी गगन के, व्याप्त हुआ बर्बर अँधियारा,
किन्तु चीरकर तम की छाती, चमका हिन्दुस्तान हमारा"
#AtalBihariVajpayee देश की दुआएं आपके लिए हैं।

1766 2018-08-16 06:29:16 Spent almost half of my monthly salary buying stocks because it seems like a good time to do it. Esp for a crazy lazy dude who overthinks about what it’s gonna be like when I finally retire.

1767 2018-08-16 06:28:19 I completyagree, and seen big companies as $cgc doing what they are doing, expanding etc, with $stz increasing their position size etc, I see a potential long term run in this MJ stocks, the problem here is if right know, the stocks are trading excesive prices (P/sales, P/E, etc

1771 2018-08-16 06:24:00 "Flippers" of regular, bluechip stocks are just harming themselves. "Flippers" of these crappy, no-good stocks are following the safest technique there is. If you happen to know any better I would welcome you to buy & hold and prove us all wrong.

1886 2018-08-16 04:47:12 Reminder to myself that once I finish commissions, I need to read up on the agriculture game, tree growing business, and stocks.
1887 2018-08-16 04:46:57 1. TRADE WELL Properly in Good Volume Based items Like TRG Strictly According to Supports and Resistances Levels.

2. INVEST WELL in dividend Paying Stocks Like Seasoned items of Each Sector Which NH is Sharing Regularly.

1890 2018-08-16 04:44:01 Today stocks higher; EUR/USD 1.139; bund yield 0.307%; 10-year Treasury 2.878%; brent $71.00; gold $1179.3 Watch: U.K. monthly retail sales figures, EU foreign trade
1891 2018-08-16 04:42:55 Blocking me only shows that you can't take the lightest of criticism. Block me right now; prove my point. Because in the end of the day, I won't be the one losing money.
1892 2018-08-16 04:42:12 they had over $4mill in NET assets as of June 2015.. over $7 mil in total assets.
as of that same time that had over $2 mil in cash assets specifically, so maybe that "reserve" is "cash on hand"?
that's all to say they have a boatload in the stocks
1893 2018-08-16 04:38:49 When entering into a fresh sector, I don't start with % allocation. I first look at the stocks to pick & look at the stocks to offload from portfolio - basically replacement. Incase there is nothing to offload, then put in fresh money. Start with small positions. Today, 500 sun.

1912 2018-08-16 04:23:29 What I'm saying , most of  the stocks arent going up. Even some of the big names pausing or coming back down. Most of this sector should be going through the roof. If this was oil or lithium or zinc with a 26% move in the commodity,  they would be gone
1913 2018-08-16 04:23:25 Also, the meeting isn't until later this month, just before the 25% tariffs are due to be imposed on Sept 5. Could be a genuine attempt to resolve their issues or window dressing to slow the speed of decline in the yuan and in US stocks. But my bet is that these talks fail. 2/2

The US Dollar didn’t match risk intensity today, whereas gold prices dropped and a key break in oil occurred. Risk aversion also spread beyond emerging markets and FAANG...
1916 2018-08-16 04:22:28 Somewhere in between. The conversation gravitated to Cu because they were buying base metals producers (tier 1 stocks). Jury is out on gold, may have some downside left, may not.

1930 2018-08-16 04:14:12 Whilst I'm presently biased towards being bullish the US, I think the economy and stocks could diverge somewhat.

This is not a diss on RH users, but it’s common sense that the application is a target for people that exploit weaknesses & use them for their advantage; especially with $HMNY / #MoviePass #stock
1937 2018-08-16 04:10:34 If performance of that stock is highest among 4 stocks but it is 40% of total Portfolio allocation then also I have to sell some portion of that stock to maintain 30% of portfolio allocation to that stock? What’s the logic ?

1947 2018-08-16 04:05:28 in this model farmers are giving holding capacity of their stocks in PPP based warehousing - it naturally makes them equal stake holders in prices - Govt purchases are negotiated with farmers lobby :)
1948 2018-08-16 04:04:14 its simple -- farmers agri exchange is separate - warehousing is provided by govt in rural areas in PPP model with local bodies like Gram Panchayats - farmers keep their stocks in these warehouses and fix the asking rates - it becomes dictating on prices in open commodity ex

This #stock can’t be considered to be like any other. MoviePass is breaking new ground; the concept is catching on.

2016 2018-08-16 03:06:00 I suspect a lot of China stocks bottomed today, at least for the time being. Watching for morning stars on $BZUN and $JD tomorrow. If they gap up I’ll probably grab some calls for a swing.
2017 2018-08-16 03:04:12 U.S. stocks had their worst day in seven weeks Wednesday amid a broad decline in global equities as technology shares were roiled by disappointing results from Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and copper sank into a bear market, weighing on commodities.

2134 2018-08-16 01:57:49 Only an idiot would base the economy on the stock market. The corporate tax cuts made a bubble in the market. Corporations are doing massive stock buybacks to inflate the market and that bubble will burst. Anyone with a basic understanding of stocks can see that.
2135 2018-08-16 01:57:08 Yes, it can. That doesn't make it a "risky" asset. Gold trades inversely of the US Dollar. 

Take a look at the past 24 hours for example. Gold fell with stocks & key commodities, Yen rose, US Dollar held up
2136 2018-08-16 01:57:01 1/2 I'm invested in 12 of the most innovative, founder-led stocks in the world. Many think they're overvalued. I think they're misunderstood.@BillGates understands.

2141 2018-08-16 01:52:17 what makes you say it wont? stocks have done it in the past.. float gets locked up and runs 8-9000% over few months. all the pieces into play here 1. current filing +possible uplist to otcqb 2. merger announcement 3. debt reduction. All of this was stated in the recent filings.
2142 2018-08-16 01:49:53 still looks good to me, entire retail sector hit hard today but think it recovers
2143 2018-08-16 01:49:22 may new version yung IIF popfic, baka ayun meron pa. Or msg Leng! May stocks ata sya sa bahay. I think you can order from her.

2146 2018-08-16 01:47:36 Honestly, the big problem with Smash 4 is the plague of grab/move into X for the early jank kills. Its not like melee where deleted stocks come from purely player skill. This is something I feel wont be an issue come ultimate, making character mastery more important than mu/jank
2147 2018-08-16 01:46:50 I love you. If you're every in Melee HD I will shine spike you as much as my fingers will allow me in 8 minutes and 4 stocks.
2148 2018-08-16 01:46:21 im pullin my stocks at the end of the week. im disgusted
2149 2018-08-16 01:43:52 I’m worst. I work in bio to get a paycheck from the bio co to then lose it in biotech stocks.
2150 2018-08-16 01:43:23 You obviously have never traded stocks with breaking poorly understood news. RDHL on July 30th, for example, closed DOWN 8% after initially being UP 80% in premarket.
2151 2018-08-16 01:43:06 If you want to do that you have to find a favorable exchange rate (i.e what you bought it for yesterday is less than what people are willing to buy it for today). Kinda like stocks.
2152 2018-08-16 01:42:50 HAHA TOTALLY!! LIKE YEAH YOU HAVE STOCKS BUT WE DONT HAVE OTHER SECRET THINGS
2153 2018-08-16 01:41:19 GS on Kotak Bank

Rejection could impact stocks’ performance in near-to-medium term if investor focus shifts from fundamental performance to regulatory aspect

2154 2018-08-16 01:41:01 Hopefully if nothing else, the stocks going down shows Twitter how bad they messed up. Even scummy companies know that they have to at least try to get it together when the stocks go down.

2161 2018-08-16 01:36:58 that SEC action against the "Tomahawk" fraud #ICO is actually a very good message to send...the founder had previously been convicted of a penny stocks fraud in 1990s...it demonstrates that in this mkt there are some actors which are here *primarily* to make a buck.
2162 2018-08-16 01:36:25 This is a very informative chart. Would TDAm make it available for all stocks as a standard offering in ThinkOrSwim?

2180 2018-08-16 01:26:07 Its been a crazy week. Self induced, too. I hope they can get private funding ASAP because I hate to see them fold. That’s a big hit to lots of folks with stocks.
2181 2018-08-16 01:25:27 Stocks are the only thing going up every year Gold price now controlled by fiat currency...think about that for a minute Peter Schiff- if he's listening lol
2182 2018-08-16 01:25:01 But Comrade Katya, you seem to be just fine with three civilians who are non government employees sit on their fat rich asses in Mar-A-Largo and dictate what should and shouldn't be done at our heros Veterans Admin. What went thru that benefited their companies or their stocks?
2183 2018-08-16 01:23:35 What gets you in trouble is when you say “this shit of a stock (or any underlying for that matter) can’t go any lower” 
Or “this insane stock can’t go any higher”

And that’s when you can really get F*ed. Lol!

2188 2018-08-16 01:21:44 (4) I lost a lot of money ($9k) with all in penny stocks. By the time I came to TrickTrades- I had $400 and that was gone (Tradenet) because my family pressured me to stop trading so I hit 1000 shares and it dropped on me and BOOM -$701.00. Done. ... I stopped Trading live
2189 2018-08-16 01:21:40 I like more stocks
2190 2018-08-16 01:21:31 Little turbulence today in stocks ..lots of noise drove us down in a pretty nasty way but we closed well off the lows ..actual data continues to come in solid but global macro fears are in control for now..think I’d rather bottom fish than get run over on an un-American short
2191 2018-08-16 01:21:29 Cant lie to you, the way @HA_Bosslax8 used to flick his hands off his controller after taking stocks off ppl was the most metal shit back in the day. If ur from va u know what im talking about lmaooo i do it when playing for glory hahahha

2197 2018-08-16 01:17:51 Yep that’s exactly what this guy said also. He expects a lot of money coming in after legalization. He says weed stocks will be spread over many peoples long term investment portfolios just like all the other sectors but that will only happen once legal.

2203 2018-08-16 01:06:55 Lost a hefty amount of coin in this cycle, but loading up the ETFs close to the bottom should make up for it tenfold. Definitely think this is what gold needs to go into a secular bull. If stocks have a real correction and gold longs are completely washed it'll b nice 4 us
2204 2018-08-16 01:06:10 In better news, I made $800 today on stocks because of Canopy Growth's (Cannabis) big jump. I know no one cares, but I want to be happy!
2205 2018-08-16 01:03:25 If the entire commodity complex collapses it will have domino effect on stock market too (energy stocks, etc).  Strong dollar is starting to effect the global economy

2207 2018-08-16 01:02:16 That’s why today I faded the “sell off” and went long on all the FANG stocks. It’s practically free money because THEY (who ever controls the markets or HFT algos) will not allow the market to sell off two days in a row LooL

2228 2018-08-16 00:41:34 About 50% of people own stocks in the US, and most of those are in retirement plans. Another statistic: the top 20% of Americans own 92% of all stocks. Stock buybacks are great when you have a significant stake in a company. But few people do.

2236 2018-08-16 00:33:43 Stocks are on sale.
2237 2018-08-16 00:33:23 So you think because you have shares you’re not middle class or poor? That’s what you inferred. Also you’re saying basically invest your money in a company(stocks) for nothing? Maybe the ones you say would benefit should be forced to invest in the companies?
2238 2018-08-16 00:31:56 Australian shares have hit a fresh ten-year high, with a surge in CSL stocks and gains for Wesfarmers helping the market overcome falls in energy and materials stocks. The benchmark S&P/#ASX200 closed up 29.4 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 6,329.0 points
