39 2018-01-31 21:58:26 Yeah good points. Our inflation has ramped up a bit. I still see this as commodities picking up, central bank inflation models forecasting higher inflation 6-18 months out & not wanting fed funds rate or bond yields getting too far in front. 2 RBA hikes this year
40 2018-01-31 21:40:43 I agree. Usually when silver takes the lead it bodes very well for gold and miners. Cryptocurrency uncertainty should also cause more speculative capital to chase returns in the most undervalued space in the market - previous metals and more broadly commodities.
41 2018-01-31 21:40:15 Damned if we do damned if we don't. Club doesn't back a successful manager again. Sponsors want a successful brand. The youth are commodities. Does the club have the patience and funds to take a few steps back? New stadium. Answers on a postcard.

44 2018-01-31 21:14:42 Did you read the quote in context? He's not saying the 60s caused it. He's saying the view that reduces people to commodities causes it. He associated it with the 60s. But there several other time periods I might add.
45 2018-01-31 21:14:15 What about humans who possess a similar level of consciousness to many nonhuman animals, such as toddlers or adults with the mental age of toddlers? What would be wrong with treating these individuals as commodities to be used and disposed of? Is it just because of their DNA?

71 2018-01-31 19:16:21 Cryptocoins are not generally accepted for commercial exchanges right now, thus not money currency. They are basically commodities though, but not because it gains value through trade (that's a trait of market valuations, not commodities).
72 2018-01-31 19:15:58 Great interview.
It's not really the focus of the interview, so I'm not sure what makes Putin so weak here.  Not disagreeing but just would like to hear more.  I think oil and commodities at these levels have been a bailout for Putin.  Not to mention low interest rates.
73 2018-01-31 19:14:48 I mean yeah that's kinda what I'm trying to say. I'm just looking at it from a human rights perspective, treating people as commodities like that, taking away their freedom.

79 2018-01-31 18:33:41 You can not increase your value when you have nothing further to sell and others no longer want to use your fiat currency as a trading currency on commodities. US depends heavily on others using their currency on trade, they sell very little.
80 2018-01-31 18:30:33 Anyone at @CBCNews or @CTVNews checked most commodities like gasoline or food for price-fixing ? Have a look on Gasbuddy or shop your local grocery store. It's more than obvious.
81 2018-01-31 18:20:47 Or, somewhere in between like 99.9999% of commodities, collectibles, materials, and resources that exist
82 2018-01-31 18:17:55 On a related topic: Was asked (long ago) to authorize commodities trader mandates allowing trading in "anything containing carbon atoms." I emailed back that the broadness of the request might prove reputationally awkward.
83 2018-01-31 18:14:53 It can go up if US treasury makes an open offer. Revalued gold solves lots of debt issues also but it looks unlikely that a system which has been trying to keep gold low versus consumption commodities suddenly changes course and reverses policy. Tough to imagine.
84 2018-01-31 18:06:00 Crypto needs to be treated as actual currency, not commodities with cap gains taxes.

101 2018-01-31 17:11:10 Right, because you can live well without other commodities such as food, water or electricity...
102 2018-01-31 17:07:11 CB's arguably already did.  Western CB's began effectively financing gov'ts years (decades?) ago, certainly post-08.  Agreed re: gold & commodities, but equities too.  Sovereign debt cycles only come once every 80 yrs or so.  They aren't kind to sov debt purch pwr.
103 2018-01-31 17:04:51 That's right, you need CBs to essentially lose their independence. In your scenario you buy TIPS, Gold, & Commodities I'd argue. You can "lock in" 2.15% inflation for 30 years.

110 2018-01-31 16:45:24 Too true. Women need to start rejecting the view that they are ‘commodities’ . It archaic and frankly not representative of the world we are living in.

122 2018-01-31 16:06:25 @ChrisCuomo I am honestly having a hard time understanding the benefits of the tax cuts when gas prices have risen $.49 a gallon, as well as food, rent & most commodities. Would you care to "get after it" & try to explain for us?
123 2018-01-31 16:01:06 Fact: @FEMA & the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not stopping the provision of food/water in Puerto Rico. As we said yesterday, we will continue to provide commodities to voluntary orgs/local officials who need resources in their communities.
124 2018-01-31 15:55:24 Commodities COO Casturo out at $GS; former GC Steve Cutler leaving $JPM: Yep, it's the aftermath of bonus season on Wall Street.
125 2018-01-31 15:51:33 I agree. They could be handled much better than they already are. Some players get treated worse than others depending on their value or length spent with the team, but at the end of the day they are in a biz where they are in fact commodities and signed up for it.
126 2018-01-31 15:51:25 Yes, this huge secret needs to come out. Vietnam and Afghanistan, poppy/opium/heroin wars. Reagan's Contra War on Nicaragua, cocaine. US War on FARC drew on Colombian proxies for a cocaine war. 3 most lucrative commodities: (3) petroleum, (2) drugs, (1) arms to protect them.

How could that be?  In today's global economy, it can be sold or traded for other commodities.

How this trade is conducted is left to the  political administration in power to handle.

Because it is a state entity.

137 2018-01-31 15:27:56 @BJP4India Control petrol, Diesel and LPG prices. Common man is suffering. If oil prices reduces means other general commodities price will reduce.
138 2018-01-31 15:27:34 I strongly believe what allows cryptocurrency values to continually increase is:
- The ability to hold ever decreasing fractions of a token
- The lack of a tie to consumable commodities
These factors distinguish from “real” currencies and push *exchange* value endlessly upwards

151 2018-01-31 14:59:39 I think it can be deep in the sense that you can fill out your last couple spots with “known commodities”/MLB starters pretty easily, but those guys (Joc, Chisenhall, Hayward, Markakis, Span etc) also lack upside and are not game changers in any categories.
152 2018-01-31 14:52:41 So #BellLetsTalk is sponsored by Bell. The company that jacks up the price for needed commodities such as the internet, adding stress to those who cannot afford it already. Wanna talk mental health? Why not lower your fking prices so people aren't stressed. #Yourenothelping

165 2018-01-31 14:29:17 Tariffs are not enough. Most finished goods for US consumption are already produced in US. Commodities like autos, trucks, & airpcraft are an exception bcz UNIT PRICE, plus they're made w many different components made by different vendors so it pays them to stage mfg offshore.
166 2018-01-31 14:22:38 Life and Citizenship in the U.S are very valuable commodities

You are thinking of theft of a material possession, but not all things of value are tangible items we can touch and hold. What about intellectual property? Stealing someone’s ideas for your own? Or time?
167 2018-01-31 14:22:17 Many more other commodities have same issue.

248 2018-01-31 07:36:22 Interesting. I'm targeting sub 5k but on a much longer duration. I think mining needs to be no longer profitable for many entities before another bull can start.....just like other commodities. Cycle will grow longer too.
249 2018-01-31 07:36:04 Empty head it takes time for things to stabilise. Fuel prices dropped, meat prices dropped, soon prices 4 other basic commodities wil drop. We are on the right direction.

256 2018-01-31 06:59:21 My request to @arunjaitley with folded hands, Please remove RCM on agri commodities. Small and medium agri enterprises are loosing working capital as they are blocking money in RCM. #GST was meant for ease of doing business, but has become punishment for small businesses

We are not stopping the provision of commodities, & will not without coordinating with the govt of Puerto Rico.
322 2018-01-31 00:28:05 Energy prices and the dollar can feed off each other since commodities tend to be priced in US dollars, meaning that a weak dollar can send them higher. The combination, though, points in one direction: inflation.
