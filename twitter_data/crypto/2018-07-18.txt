4 2018-07-18 23:59:17 Panel of crypto experts in congressional hearing unanimously said, to stop market manipulation, exchanges should register and regulators should have oversight. Little sad that an originally cypherpunk/libertarian movement hasn't been able to self-regulate and fraud is so rampant.
5 2018-07-18 23:59:08 Some of the greatest ideas came from places outside of conventional thought. Not easy to know when you are part of crowd think (stink) & dismiss the “uninformed”. A lot of people very capable in one field assume to be experts in all fields. This is very evident in crypto.

Just noticed your handle, that is sick. Bullish on macro.

Also made me realize I’m a Twitter scrub and should look at handles more often.
13 2018-07-18 23:57:49 My list:
- Kill T[] "covariance"
- Kill SymmetricAlgorithm & other base crypto types
- More investment in JIT earlier
- Better decoupling of core concepts and assemblies
- Treat API usability as security concern
- Simplify System.Configuration APIs

17 2018-07-18 23:57:15 Almost leverage longed $XRP earlier, now glad I didn't and not touching it until 5700.
18 2018-07-18 23:57:12 I’ve watched a lot of sci-fi. In all of the shows I watched, no character ever mentioned “dollars” the currency in the futures are always go by “credit, tokens, etc.” Crypto currency are also mentioned a lot. Hmmm...
