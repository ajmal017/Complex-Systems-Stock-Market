2 2018-09-20 23:59:41 I see your cheese burn, and raise you pepper hot cheese burn.  You get pepper oil AND hot cheese rooasting you as you eat that pizza or meatball sandwich.
3 2018-09-20 23:59:40 @HaydnSchneider for the cbd oil and pills is it your preference ? Why is the oil form a little more steeper... curious! Is it bc it last longer ? Obviously I’m a first time buyer for this 
4 2018-09-20 23:59:37 Anyone wonder why Trump is so worried about oil prices? Let me help you it's because this is not an actual recovery but rather the US economy is getting more fragile by the day with the bond market starting to break. Low oil prices are stealth QE. Sorry man truth is a bear.
5 2018-09-20 23:59:28 US/UK/Israel/France NeoCons are all itching to bait Russia into a conflict, so they can all gang up with NATO to get Russia out of the way, take out Assad, and move onto Iran. They all want a piece of control of the oil flow. It's always about the damn oil.
6 2018-09-20 23:59:16 Its great, but also stressful lol compared to driving a oil burning car. My suggestion if I may, is get one with the longest range you can (or a pluggable hybrid).

15 2018-09-20 23:57:36 I'm confident that if they keep the House & Senate, we are close to the GOP making leaded gasoline & paint legal again to "spare those industries from burdensome regulation." Soon enough thalidomide will be available. Anti-"Frivolous lawsuit" laws to protect oil companies. Etc.
16 2018-09-20 23:57:35 Ok they can do it w/out Timber-Sycamore, the CIA, the US Army, & my tax $. You know that Dick Cheney's on the board of Genie Energy which is Drilling in the contested Golan Heights, right. That's probably why we're there-4 the benefit of a few billionaires, stealing oil as usual.
17 2018-09-20 23:57:19 I use a blend of essential oils called PastTense from Doterra. Lavender oil is one of the oils in it. Gets rid of my cluster headaches in 5 minutes. Then ibuprofen keeps them away. Once the oils wear off, the ibuprofen kicks in. The roll on is like $20 and lasts me months.

53 2018-09-20 23:55:49 The USA is fully self dependent in oil supply. Middle East prices affect us ONLY because the GOP Congress allowed sale of US oil to overseas buyers so that US opil companies could increase their profits. Fix THAT.

55 2018-09-20 23:55:35 As for corporations, mostly they get money from people buying their products. But also govt gives them lots of tax breaks. Do farmers need to be paid to not grow crops? Does big oil need to pay 0%? This country gives them a lot. Shouldn't they contribute to help the least of thee

65 2018-09-20 23:54:21 You're right, animals were not "put on earth". They're also not here for  our entertainment either, actually they're not here "for" anything. But  we can care for them, and one way of doing that is raising awareness  and empathy by bringing them closer to the public.

71 2018-09-20 23:53:59 Ever try getting a massage? Massage can sometimes help with migraines if you have work done on the upper back and other muscles such as scalenes. Or you can try essential oils such as lavender, ecuaylptus or peppermint oil.

79 2018-09-20 23:53:14 I’m sorry, are we not now the worlds biggest producer of crude oil?
Maybe you should be talking to the domestic producers and refiners. You know like that guy that use to be your Sec of State
80 2018-09-20 23:52:40 I’ve always heard that tea tree oil is really soothing and can help combat it - I used to recommend tea tree shampoos for clients who had it on their scalps!
81 2018-09-20 23:52:36 You are quite the philosopher-poet.
82 2018-09-20 23:52:31 some dude made a body oil for my mom and named it Love. idk how i feel about this
83 2018-09-20 23:52:27 I'm fine with olive oil. It doesn't generally taste like those atrocious balls of doom.
84 2018-09-20 23:52:18 This is why I left religion. Bible thumpers who are little more than scammy snake oil salesmen.
85 2018-09-20 23:52:13 I think that it’s beautiful — beautiful and terrible like an oil refinery at night, a mushroom cloud, or Galadriel wearing the One Ring
86 2018-09-20 23:52:07 Really? Because when the price of oil dropped, the Alberta economy seemed fairly hard-hit for such a small piece of the pie. Puzzling .
87 2018-09-20 23:51:56 I was making an ironical statement that oil companies have no ethics.
88 2018-09-20 23:51:55 High oil prices benefits the USA by making domestic oil profitable (fracking/offshore,etc) thereby reducing foreign oil dependence and also creates jobs.  Better idea is to focus on greener energy/reduced consumption while at the same time benefiting from world market oil prices.
89 2018-09-20 23:51:55 Trump doesn't set oil prices in spite of the HFT Goons at the NT Fed. Have "Price Controls" ever worked? They lead to chaotic price increases the cure for high oil prices are high oil prices. I'm surprised none of the Fed's 800 economist know this (they must have gone to college)
90 2018-09-20 23:51:48 If you don’t have me on snap I mentioned before I have 2 cartridges for oil pens // it’s grape ape and both are $50 or 1 for $25 HMU!!!!!
91 2018-09-20 23:51:24 What do you mean get prices down?  In a capitalist system the free market dictates prices.  What price are they suppose to get it down to since you know oil economics?  If your for a free market stay the out of it and let the markets dictate oil prices.
92 2018-09-20 23:51:12 I prefer the balm, but I have oils too. Sometimes I combine them, if I have the same style in both. The oil goes on, then the balm, if you use both. But my beard always smells fantastic! Take care of it and it will be beautiful.
93 2018-09-20 23:50:57 As I understand your plans, your TRISO particle fuels will be marketed to all.
Maybe you’ll be the Standard Oil of HTGR fuels.
94 2018-09-20 23:50:55 I got my oil changed at a new mechanic today and they were SO NICE and treated me like a person it was amazing but also the bar is literally so low
95 2018-09-20 23:50:51 Unless you buy a big jug that’s not entirely used.  In which case save that and find another container to pour the old oil in, then dispose of it at a location that will take old fluids.
96 2018-09-20 23:50:42 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

98 2018-09-20 23:50:28 They keep raising prices on us we will have to opt out and use our own we have plenty I've kept off wheels in the US I know this for a fact I've seen them no reason why we should have to depend on other countries for gasoline or oil products.

100 2018-09-20 23:50:23 It's been 12 years, it hasn't hardly gone up.  Oil company profiteering is costing us more... and the extra $3 billion we pay them doesn't get us anything.  At least ab32 is helping fix smog... LA just had three straight months over the ozone limit.  Not cool.
101 2018-09-20 23:50:09 Using sunflower oil as a first step in cleansing is ok for a combo-oily skin like mine

106 2018-09-20 23:49:43 And we fight to protect the export lines for all that gas and oil that we are poisoning ourselves to allow the fossil fuel companies to export out of the United States

113 2018-09-20 23:49:05 I just don’t want to be in the dark but that was the last straw. It’s their fucking oil. The United States has been stealing from them since forever and now he’s mad they wanna raise their praises when these poor countries have been demolished and destroyed. I can’t
114 2018-09-20 23:48:59 Good tip for beginners which is not immediately obvious. When  you are done poor the now cooled spent oil into the empty oil can/jug your new oil came in.
115 2018-09-20 23:48:52 i had to buy jars for my color class because i needed containers for oil paint stuff but at target they only came in 4-packs and i only needed two jars

133 2018-09-20 23:47:01 Are u for real? If the prices go below 50$ a barrel, US oil production will collapsed. it only cost the Saudi’s a few dollar to produce their oil while US fracking is over 50$. First welfare for the farmers and soon for the oil workers and producers. You are as dumb as shit!

135 2018-09-20 23:46:41 yo face shiny doe lol u said no make-up so that must be lotion, body oil, sumn

138 2018-09-20 23:46:05 20% EUR recovery on primary recovery in unconventional oil? Keep drinking the koolaid #Ponzie
139 2018-09-20 23:45:58 Check your Engine oil today.
140 2018-09-20 23:45:40 i was rather enjoying the idea of reading the robot's deposition and then negotiating with the robot in caucus. was wondering if in addition to bringing in lunch i'd be wise to bring an oil can.
141 2018-09-20 23:45:40 Just make sure you have some oil in your car at least 
142 2018-09-20 23:45:22 Does anyone else remember when these checked bag fees were justified by rising oil prices? Perhaps someone should clue them in to the fact that it is no longer expensive and they are just increasing their profit margin
143 2018-09-20 23:45:19 I got some oil for your body
144 2018-09-20 23:45:17 Due to forecast of thunderstorms for Friday night, the varsity football game at Oil City will begin at 6 pm instead of 7 pm.
145 2018-09-20 23:45:03 We are definitely still protecting oil supply lines, not necessarily for Americans but for so-called "American" companies. Also, the wars are about opening markets to multinationals. Fossil fuel companies are just one industry. Banks, telecoms, pharma...We fight for all of them
146 2018-09-20 23:44:51 Ok, CBD pals, who do y’all get your oil from?

It’s vape time.
147 2018-09-20 23:44:48 Oil is cheap, every single problem lack of it causes is actually thousands of dollars.... you do the math.
148 2018-09-20 23:44:44 cooking was... as expected for someone cooking bacon for the first time?
by which I mean, I saw it was done and went 'oh fuck i forgot to get a plate' and now she is ~the crisp~

broccoli was different this time, maybe because the oil was already heated up?
... i forgot seasoning
149 2018-09-20 23:44:38 Does anyone else remember when these checked bag fees were put in place because of rising gas prices? Perhaps someone should tell them that oil prices have dropped dramatically
150 2018-09-20 23:44:31 i swear in 8 years of going down the rabbit hole of researching oil & gas accidents, i have seen a lot of media blackouts, but i have never seen anything like this.
151 2018-09-20 23:44:27 Women get a car and don’t check no oil, no tire pressure, no nothing they just wake up and drive that Shit

153 2018-09-20 23:44:10 Hi! All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting cannabis products, like hemp oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
154 2018-09-20 23:43:44 I normally shop at Tesco's, their one has palm oil in though. Will def get the one from Sainsburys
155 2018-09-20 23:43:37 Or we move on from oil all together perhaps we aught use the greatest power we have-manpower
156 2018-09-20 23:43:25 Funny how you support the oil companies polluting out Great Country. Someone just looking for more profits from oil companies. All half truths on your part again!
157 2018-09-20 23:43:12 Mr. President We thought that increase oil price is positive to support $ Only petrodollar is our cover for Fed
158 2018-09-20 23:42:58 My homies: lemme get some of dat oil
Me: what kind? 
Them: it doesn’t matter I just want some 

Pinshissss  
159 2018-09-20 23:42:50 We don't need opec oil, the reason we do buy their oil, is so can have rocket base close to Russia.
160 2018-09-20 23:42:45 So we discovered the fact that BTS’ stylists lather their legs in oil before pulling on their pants for them backstage
161 2018-09-20 23:42:30 We need solar all over! Solar delivers ghettoes! Oil keeps them! Share the wealth!

166 2018-09-20 23:41:50 you know, just because humans have a killer instict doesn't mean killing someone is "just how humans are"
just because humans need to have sex and eat doesnt' mean ther eisn't an appropriate place and time for it

176 2018-09-20 23:40:28 Maybe Canada should sell that crude oil to China , because China really really want a trade agreement with Canada

181 2018-09-20 23:39:35 So delicious. I've started using French sea salt from Costco over my regular kosher salt and I really like the results. The combo of onions, carrots, olive oil, a bit of good Balsamic, and the salt is soooo good
182 2018-09-20 23:39:30 There’s a restaurant called extra virgin olive oil??

192 2018-09-20 23:38:24 No more US dollars or military equipment unless they work with us. On second thought we should just take their oil
193 2018-09-20 23:38:22 Javier, I am interested in your opinion about the impact the meeting in Algiers this weekend will have on oil prices. Care to share your expertise?

196 2018-09-20 23:38:10 Delicious Greek Salad!!! Love the combination of olives, tomatoes, red onion, feta, cucumber, oregano & olive oil. It goes well with Souvlaki from @theathenianuk in #Tooting @TootingMarket
197 2018-09-20 23:38:08 Kraus’ Pizza...Canton, OH...mini pepperonis holding oil and onion PCs in the sauce! OMG @chris_spielman Massillon also!
198 2018-09-20 23:37:59 Made brownies tonight and didn’t have some of the ingredients, replaced 1 egg with applesauce and vegetable oil with butter, and it tasted pretty good. Just thought I’d share this 
199 2018-09-20 23:37:57 “In April and May 1938, there existed little German governmental interest in exploiting the oil crisis in Mexico. What was keeping Berlin from exploiting this historical opportunity in Mexico?” 

Hitler didn’t want war with Great Britain nor the United States. He wanted peace!
200 2018-09-20 23:37:52 BP has caused more environmental damage than they could ever make up for.  They want to kiss ass to get oil rigs off the Carolina's and it ain't happening. Plus, you are an ass.
201 2018-09-20 23:37:45 "Oil change" is the euphemism I use for changing my tampon sooooo... I was real confused for a moment there.

203 2018-09-20 23:37:18 Oh yeah, and energy. Although I just saw an energy analyst explain that the cost of wind and solar is plummeting below oil, and nuclear is soaring. Obvs, we're making the wrong trade to bring prices down, which is going to be Wynne's fault also, I'm guessing.

207 2018-09-20 23:35:38 But the point is to make the blade hard, wouldn't Oil of UlayOlay make it soft? I mean, that's what it does to hands, right?

It may be necessary to do some testing...

211 2018-09-20 23:35:01 U can mix a lil oil with lotion so u don’t just have oil on ur face. Try it because maybe mines is just really dry cause I need just the oil olone
212 2018-09-20 23:34:59 We've been involved in perpetual warfare for decades so our weapons manufacturers can make a killing off of killing mostly brown people over oil.
213 2018-09-20 23:34:42 I wasnt growing it. It was all donated. My charges are for manufacture and supply of oil.. not cannabis cultivation.

215 2018-09-20 23:34:36 #Acne more often affects skin with a greater number of oil glands; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back.
216 2018-09-20 23:34:31 All American force go back to ur country we absolutely don't need u .. for what ? More war here ? 

And it's not ur busnes u want oil you pay for it ! Otherwise better to cut u off ..
217 2018-09-20 23:34:19 Swiftly beginning to cook the raw meat、the woman lathered it up with a small coat of oil．It added flavor—.

And proceeded to place it in a pan to cook.

  Now she’ll wait just a few moments to flip.
218 2018-09-20 23:34:18 The entire industry is subsidized. Elon said before he’d rather them all go away and just compete straight-on. Oil is subsidized, gas carmakers are subsidized, etc etc. so of course an EV carmaker in turn needs subsidies to be competitive. Do your damn research
219 2018-09-20 23:34:12 It is said that the AntiChrist will learn from Hitler’s mistake. One of them was not supporting the German Navy efforts on getting Mexican oil. If the German navy had their hands on the oil there wouldn’t have been a D-Day. Therefore Germany would have been the victors.
220 2018-09-20 23:34:03 Flood the market with our oil.
221 2018-09-20 23:33:41 The biggest win of my life might be when I ran out of olive oil while cooking, looked in the pantry and realized I actually had a new bottle ready to go
222 2018-09-20 23:33:40 You get the impression that Jimmy doesn't buy into that 'high flying lawyer' lifestyle and thinks it's bullshit. Which explains he loves the shady snake oil salesman side of the career and life
223 2018-09-20 23:33:34 Bomb #Iran and take their oil and gas ..
224 2018-09-20 23:33:20 LMAO now you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel. Quirky Corky is the latest relic you trot out to sell your snake oil?!
225 2018-09-20 23:33:15 Why don't we just use our own oil instead of selling it to other countries?
226 2018-09-20 23:33:03 isnt there a bacteria that turns plastic back into oil that got scrapped as a viable solution not to long ago as well
227 2018-09-20 23:32:59 @BingingWBabish after cooking on my cast iron, what am I supposed to do? You mentioned something about oil on your Basics video

238 2018-09-20 23:32:00 Cortisone injections are a last resort pain relief.

And as much as I LOATHE it, I take percocet every night before bed. Cannabis is great but percocet with some good high thc indica oil is my preferred combo for bed time. One or the other isn't enough to ease the pains for sleep
239 2018-09-20 23:31:53 The arms carry you deeper into the machine. Any clothes are dissolved, and you get coated in some sort of oil or lotion. It smells nice, a strawberry scent! Although what it's *doing* to your body is perhaps the more interesting part. What it does isn't yet apparent, though.

241 2018-09-20 23:31:47 The main reason for the economic crisis is not divesting from oil -- which is their primary product and which is currently in the toilet -- not a certain portion of their economy being nationalized, since as has already been stated, the bulk of their economy is still capitalist.

247 2018-09-20 23:30:15 Since we are now among the top oil producers in the world, maybe we should stop blaming other countries and start looking at our own oil companies for that solution. Our own oil companies have a too big to fail Monopoly on gas prices that goes up and down with politics. Dumbass
248 2018-09-20 23:30:14 have you tried cooking it in a pan with olive oil and sauteed onions
249 2018-09-20 23:30:12 The only thing I would add to what you said, TJ, is that besides US sanctions, the price of oil dropped in the internation market, plummeting Venezuela's economy (90% + dependent on it). Maduro, even more corrupt and authoritarian than Chavez, is also making everything worse.

254 2018-09-20 23:29:16 Means less help from housing to the economy which is usually the best leading indicator of slowing gdp - hence lower rates / inversion as you have predicted especially if oil lower and fed keeps pushing

260 2018-09-20 23:27:22 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
261 2018-09-20 23:27:00 I recommend green bean fries with pan seared chicken. Sprinkle frozen green beans with olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs of your choice. pop'em in the oven at 375F-400F convection for around 10 minutes. Toss them around to redistribute and give them another 10 or until crisp.
262 2018-09-20 23:26:56 Make sure whoever does your oil change, puts the oil pan back on correctly. My parents got it changed once and the pan was loose. That can only happen during an oil change. If it's not secured properly, it can cause massive damage and be a big danger to you while driving

269 2018-09-20 23:26:01 So all the people people who insist Twizzlers are great and Red Vines are gross, do you actively like the slimy mineral-oil-ey finish on them or just like them in spite of it? I'm about neutral on RVs but cannot eat Twizz at all for that textural reason.
270 2018-09-20 23:25:59 It’s your policies that have caused oil prices to increase and soybeans to crash, you economic ignorance is showing.
271 2018-09-20 23:25:59 Putting aside the arguments for and against the purpose of the CNY oil futures contract, I can’t imagine anyone who, even at a degree or two of separation from Chinese officialdom, would ever come close to owning up to a “take down the $” agenda.

273 2018-09-20 23:25:42 Regarding constipation: I deal with a lifelong issue & the only thing that has ever worked for me is a tablespoon of olive oil in the morning, before I eat anything. I do that again midday, before dinner. No meds helped my particular case except the olive oil. Hope it works for u

277 2018-09-20 23:24:27 This is an outstanding thread, and spot on. Among the major oil exporting countries are Saudi Arabia (friendly, when they want to be), Iraq (same), Iran (hostile) and...Russia (currently waging war on the U.S.).
278 2018-09-20 23:24:09 People have short (no pun intended) memories.  Clearly there are bubbles here, however having personal experience with hemp oil, cancer, and pain I am high ahem on Cannabis stocks.  Real companies with sales, marketing and products.
279 2018-09-20 23:24:06 A hot shower, cbd oil, a muscle relaxer and cooling gel on my shoulder. If this pain doesn't fade in a few minutes just put me down.

282 2018-09-20 23:23:51 Simply create a US gov oil company. Then make enough oil to drive down prices. Europe was practically brought to its knees with evil saudis & others manipulation oil production. Also, ask US oil companies to ramp up production for US consumers. The US has more oil than the saudis
283 2018-09-20 23:23:50 Oil level =/= oil life. Oil breaks down over time and dergrades into sludge which can destroy an engine. Change it every 3k-5k miles

287 2018-09-20 23:23:38 TV preachers are religions version of snake oil salesmen. They will say anything and do anything to further their agenda. Even if that agenda is to become rich and powerful. It has nothing to do with their "God." Its much baser than that.
288 2018-09-20 23:23:37 I’m officially drained from work like today was a bitch and I’m covered in all types of oil and fuel and just crap
289 2018-09-20 23:22:59 the situation in Venezuela is very simple, holds the largest reserve of oil in the world, and is state owned. The Bolivarian revolution has undergone intense economic war since the inversions of Chaves.
290 2018-09-20 23:22:56 @CaptainVTwitch If corn oil is made from corn and vegetables oil is made from vegetables. Then what is baby oil made from?

322 2018-09-20 23:19:01 There are a few countries that would benefit if Syria falls..... Israel, U.S, France and UK. (Especially the first one) Syria has gas and oil. You can guess why so many countries want a regime change.

332 2018-09-20 23:16:50 Dr Oz still teaches at Columbia University, yet he peddles snake oil. It is self-deception to believe that an expert in one field is necessarily an expert in others.
333 2018-09-20 23:16:46 Rocky the oil change plug honestly
334 2018-09-20 23:16:35 Hell na I get my oil changes when they are due and I like cold brew not iced coffee

342 2018-09-20 23:15:53 That's false there able to manipulate oil prices without there always being a high demand. Sometimes they just do it for there own benefit.

385 2018-09-20 23:10:24 Canada buys approx 1.5% of total Saudi oil exports annually & is becoming more reliant on Saudi oil everyday with it's inability to even build a pipeline. (this is common knowledge). As usual dummies have to have it spelled out for them at every step of the way & at every turn.
386 2018-09-20 23:10:19 Does GAO do cost/benefit analysis on these sales? I know there is Congressional oversight because of the civilian casualties (being ignored). Is there a benefit to the US to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia? In the past, we didn’t get break on oil.

391 2018-09-20 23:09:54 We protect the countries of the Middle East because they have something of value. Oil. Where was America during the Serbian invasions in the 90’s? It was genocide on a mass scale but America just stood idly by while it happened. There is nothing of value for us there so no help.
392 2018-09-20 23:09:50 hydrogen interests are calling for hundreds of millions of government handouts for hydrogen filling stations  but given the huge profits of the oil companies promoting hydrogen is obscene.

394 2018-09-20 23:09:48 You have been lied to. The non-binding referendum was rigged. No one knows how oil - or food - will be managed post-Brexit. Deal or No Deal there is no “good Brexit.” Save yourselves! New vote!!!

410 2018-09-20 23:08:03 We should stop supporting them. We have are own oil.
411 2018-09-20 23:07:14 if you brought me a bottle of some synthetic oil and said "according to studies this MCT oil is the best oil EVAR" i would say "great now shove it up your ass" because our ancestors never bought anything from Dave Asprey not MCT not ketones etc ...
412 2018-09-20 23:07:11 Just like when Gartman said "We'll never see oil above $50 in my lifetime.  

Markets reprice fast.  Never underestimate the future.
413 2018-09-20 23:07:11 not to mention, the US will soon be self sufficient with oil and gas and no longer want to buy ours. Energy East, Transmountain, get ‘em built
414 2018-09-20 23:06:57 Employees in oil have employment inurance but because farmers are self employed, they do not even have that.
415 2018-09-20 23:06:43 By leasing them out for oil and gas??? Wrong.
416 2018-09-20 23:06:41 forgot to dilute the lavender essential oil now we’re rlly dying

422 2018-09-20 23:06:07 YOU SELL ARMS TO THEM    ARE YOU GOING TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF ARMS TO THEM?   OIL PRICES ARE QUITE LOW.  PISS THEM OFF AND THEY WILL ADD A TARIFF TO THE OIL. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.  RESIGN WHILE YOU CAN.
423 2018-09-20 23:05:59 My lil sis drove her car for over a yr with her oil light on. Burned out the engine on her new car. Smh.

425 2018-09-20 23:05:38 Get some oil
426 2018-09-20 23:05:38 Probably tmi but since starting to take cod liver oil I feel like my boobs have gotten slightly bigger wow
427 2018-09-20 23:05:35 Take the oil cooler right off a central pivot planter with out much effort
428 2018-09-20 23:05:25 BaarakAllah u fikoum pour votre conseil. En effet, nous nous régalons déjà avec les miels de nos frères de @bienfaitsdorien al hamdoulillah. Qu’Allah les préserves et mette la baraka dans leur tijara ainsi qu’à vous.
429 2018-09-20 23:05:22 And OPEC is not a Libyan company, the lawyer you mentioned worked in SLB before another IOC, how many women hold leading managerial positions in NOC and its companies? None
It’s good that we r discussing this,maybe it’s time to have a study focused on women in the oil industry
430 2018-09-20 23:05:05 it’s 2018 and we still don’t have a solution on how to get oil stains out of a shirt without it taking hours
431 2018-09-20 23:04:56 おいるさん、おはようございますありらじら
432 2018-09-20 23:04:52 yeah coconut oil is cool and all for your hair, but try getting that smell out afterwards
433 2018-09-20 23:04:42 if you push for renewable energies we wouldn't have to worried about old oil prices
434 2018-09-20 23:04:41 That's not an oil or business issue but an employment issue. Which sucks but imagine having to keep working the same hours but without getting paid and actually paying to work. A dairy farmer needs to continue to milk and care for cows but now does it while losing money every day
435 2018-09-20 23:04:20 Beto has already spoken about his DWI, & apologized for it, so if you're trying to "out" him, you're too late.

But, I haven't heard Ted talk about getting paid by the NRA, Russian Dark Money, big Oil, 3-D guns org, & the Mercers. And, he supports conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
436 2018-09-20 23:04:14 Like with most of my other piercings, I got a small bump but it cleared itself with a little tea tree oil. Mine feels healed but my piercer told me it wasn’t yet.. I got my jewelry changed from a barbell to a hoop bc the barbell was too tight on it and was causing trouble.

438 2018-09-20 23:03:54 It's so perfect! The Boost Your Radiance Oil is simply amazing and my skin has never felt softer!
439 2018-09-20 23:03:51 Know what will make all these high oil prices drop dramatically? Clean energy.  While we continue to encourage using inefficient energy. The rest of the world is abandoning it forcing #OPEC to compensate by increases our prices.  #CleanEnergyIsIndependence
440 2018-09-20 23:03:49 In other word supply more! .. wasn’t the US were mad in the past when OPIC increases their supply to keep their market share and the oil prices went down. The US back then said that was a war against US oil because it cost them more to produce. Make your Mind
441 2018-09-20 23:03:44 How do I apply for rubbing oil on the models....
442 2018-09-20 23:03:43 Drilling for oil, refining oil, delivering oil, and constantly burning fuel as you drive is much, much, much dirtier than driving an EV.
443 2018-09-20 23:03:28 [Holding back the rage of having eight years tech experience] P-please. Change your oil. Please.

463 2018-09-20 23:01:32 Liven up the date by asking them how they feel about the government investing more into the coal and oil industry than renewable energy.

467 2018-09-20 23:00:38 I am sure that the oil companies realized that pumping and selling that product would be tantamount to selling blood diamonds, and would ethically put a halt to all sales.

Mmmhaahaahaaa, I couldn't resist a joke!

469 2018-09-20 23:00:23 Er no Donnie. US prices for oil are rising mainly because of supply fears due to your personal sanctions on Iran. I realize you don't understand how international supply chains & markets work, you being terribly dim, but I suggest you just leave this to the adults and STFU.
470 2018-09-20 23:00:12 I’ll always cheer for the Jets first but with McDavid & Nuge in the line-up for the Oil, and none of the Jets top guys, it’s could be a tough game.
471 2018-09-20 23:00:10 My mom keeps telling me to go get my oil changed on my car and everytime I call her I have to start off with “hi my mom no I haven’t gotten my oil changed I will eventually but let’s move on from that and leave it in the past. So, how’s my cat?”
472 2018-09-20 23:00:06 "Chilli oil enema!" screamed Prime Minister May, "It's 12:00AM and I still haven't resigned yet."

474 2018-09-20 22:59:59 I transferred back to Omega because no dumpster fire is truly lit without throwing oil on it and sending it to space. My guess is that in 3 days I am going to be SO DONE WITH THIS GAME. I am literally mocking myself, I am so tired xD
475 2018-09-20 22:59:35 Hey, the US is producing more oil & you sucked up to Saudi Arabia, the largest member in OPEC-what happened to that great relationship? Played again?
476 2018-09-20 22:59:35 Milk and Oil is Ewwwww

GF: And covered in...oil?

ME:-Well, you know how you always say I never glisten?

GF: Listen. You never listen.

ME:-Oh
481 2018-09-20 22:58:40 Oil prices will rise, the world needs more oil, OPEC is a Saudi organization that controls us.
482 2018-09-20 22:58:19 Dude no! I voted for you ! I’m in the oil and gas business and we NEED high oil prices! Not Low! It will kill all Houston Jobs!
483 2018-09-20 22:58:17 First I've heard of the oil but wouldn't suprise me.
484 2018-09-20 22:58:16 Brother Trump where ElBaradei from the oil story yesterday was with Bush oppressed Iraq, etc. Today, he defends the oil states because of the dollars earned from them
485 2018-09-20 22:57:58 Is that dough and a pickle covered In olive oil? What tf is wrong with people 
486 2018-09-20 22:57:47 @BabajideOtitoju
Please ask Ibemere to learn to make his point quickly. He takes forever. He reminds me of an Oil vessel trying to change course in the middle of the sea.
487 2018-09-20 22:57:44 I got my oil changed today so therefore that’s enough being a grown up for the week and now I’m gonna mess with my hair
488 2018-09-20 22:57:29 Bobbi Brown makeup remover is the bomb. I only wear waterproof mascara and this is the only stuff that takes it off ,one swipe. Coconut oil takes a little more work in my opinion

493 2018-09-20 22:57:13 I did not.. I was just shokced!! Feeling worried if he touched a live wire considering its oil ki bijli!! What I mean, lack of education and knowledge makes the people fall victims to these patwari type ppl, same happens in Sindh.
494 2018-09-20 22:56:59 Sorry, was it the government that built the refineries to an inefficient scale? Did the government misjudge the market wildly in planning/construction?

Not to defend decades of gov't taxes on gas, but it sure seems like some people are *really* eager to defend oil companies
495 2018-09-20 22:56:58 Dealerships are the absolute nut low.  Schedule a 3:00pm oil change.  It is now 3:56pm and my car has yet to even go back.   Great customer service you got here @Ford

506 2018-09-20 22:55:56 I played myself: Recently, I’ve been using oil (Jojoba and Rosehip) as facial moisturizers and not wearing make up. Today, I decided to beat my face. AROUND 1pm, my face looked like someone shook an empty bucket of chicken and all the residual grease and  crumbs fell on my face.
507 2018-09-20 22:55:44 Actually we "carpet bomb them" as you once said, and we sell arms to the Saudi's so they can carpet bomb them as well. For once this isn't on you, its been happening for decades, but don't act like we promote peace their. Starting wars for oil is not peace.
508 2018-09-20 22:55:30 So what you are saying is that rather quickly you are going to need 12 Billion to Bail Out the Oil Industry because your Bully Tactics are going to fail with Opec liked they failed with China!
509 2018-09-20 22:54:59 #trump .....trump may get mad idea to implement t not just auto tariffs but steep tariffs on Canada oil that flows to US....
510 2018-09-20 22:54:55 Oh man! Twitter is ridiculous!! Thanks for letting us know. I'll try to remember to check and see if he's back later. AFAIK, suspensions are usually either for 12 hours or for a week. Those are the two types I've had anyway.

513 2018-09-20 22:54:37 I had no idea other than it is just bad. I use vinegar, orange oil and dish soap mixture.
514 2018-09-20 22:54:33 Love how my job always has work and is crazy busy feels like I got some job security even tho it’s crazy ass oil
515 2018-09-20 22:54:31 Yeah I understand, and for the oceans with oil companies in them.

517 2018-09-20 22:54:20 How can the board of $PIR Pier 1 One support the terrible, terrible Alasdair James?  This guy was a failure previously and is certainly one now.

518 2018-09-20 22:54:08 who do you protect?and against whom?
you protect monarchies against the will of their people?
you destroy countries &massacre children to preserve a royal family that provides you with money and oil
remember  that the blood that runs for the oil to flow will curse U all your life
519 2018-09-20 22:53:58 Oil. You fool! OIL!

Though they never specify what kind of oil.

I'm presuming it's a prime virgin olive oil...
520 2018-09-20 22:53:58 Yes, Big Oil interests Trump American consumers.  Why were gas prices lower under Obama’s Presidency? Answer: Trump’s servile to Putin’s gas industry.
521 2018-09-20 22:53:55 Taking demonically scalding hot showers and applying coconut oil lotion after. 
522 2018-09-20 22:53:55 How is buying oil from regimes that have no climate policy or gender equality advancing your agenda?
523 2018-09-20 22:53:52 Not the Middle East, use American oil.
524 2018-09-20 22:53:51 He's fine but he don't have no oil.
525 2018-09-20 22:53:49 If you got a GM car that needs an oil change come by for 15$ i’ll change it and i’ll supply everything from oil to filter.
526 2018-09-20 22:53:44 I’ve had my car since February and only got an oil change once. Bruh how is my car still running 
527 2018-09-20 22:53:44 Just got home from a 90 minute massage where my masseuse used cannabis oil. I feel Good!!!
528 2018-09-20 22:53:30 So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying for? 
If long life is what we all live for
Then long life will come to pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And you think you got it bad 

Prince: Money Don’t Matter 2 Nite
529 2018-09-20 22:53:18 If I absolutely have to I can change the tire , the oil , add fluids . But I’m not doing anything but driving it 
530 2018-09-20 22:53:13 LOL. Honestly though, on a new car, it’s not worth the hassle because most come with free oil changes.

535 2018-09-20 22:52:59 Hahaha father inlaw bought a cheap reloader! Got oil on the primer or something! Shells would take a second to fire one never went off so he pull the stock from his shoulder! Went off and knocked his two front teeth loose! He pushed them back down and they stayed
536 2018-09-20 22:52:58 It would be miserable for Dr. Ford, but I hope they pick @JudgeJeanine. 

Dr. Ford can be represented by Sam Waterston and they can get Gordon Ramsay to make gourmet popcorn with truffle oil and himalayan salt for us all to enjoy.

We'll all make a day of it.
537 2018-09-20 22:52:55 This hurts the every day person, every penny takes money away from something else. We need to use are oil now Middle East, we have enough oil for 1000s of years right here. President Trump help bring the price down for us.
538 2018-09-20 22:52:11 And your point is?? Wait, let me guess, you are a clueless socialist that believes that money grows on trees. Or that the 100M barrels of oil required to power the planet should be supplied by everyone except Canada. Please humour me...
539 2018-09-20 22:52:04 I'm sure they got her as oil.
540 2018-09-20 22:51:56 Not that I need a man but I’d be nice to have one to fill my tank, do my oil change and wash my car lol just things I wish I didn’t have to do

555 2018-09-20 22:49:09 In Ireland if we left the EU the lights would go out. In the UK when the Scottish oil runs out the lights will go out too. #bettertogether #bbcqt
556 2018-09-20 22:49:04 First it was The Keto diet on the list comparing all diets. Then trying to put shade on coconut oil. Now, you’re just gonna die early. LOL - it worked for cigarettes and alcohol ... don’t forget the side attacks on meat and butter laws/comp policies Thk goodness for cheese..wait!
557 2018-09-20 22:49:01 Need some oil of olay round those ol' puffy eyes
558 2018-09-20 22:48:53 Why would the moron $PIR Alasdair James release an earnings guidance so close to actual earnings?  This guy is terrible. Listen to the next conference call. No clue, no direction.  Monotone, boring, non-motivational. CFO just as bad.  It would be a "New Day" if you suspend salary
559 2018-09-20 22:48:47 i needah get up early 2ma nd get my oil changed
560 2018-09-20 22:48:46 @realDonaldTrump For our environment, please have your people look into hemp base plastics, instead of oil based. They will bio- degrade, saving animals & eco system.
561 2018-09-20 22:48:17 Trudeau is a snake oil salesman making frivolous claims.
562 2018-09-20 22:48:07 Hmmm
I guess you're versatile
so what do you do ?
anointing oil?
olive oil?
 goya oil?
563 2018-09-20 22:47:50 i forgot how overwhelming tea tree oil can be and i regret my decisions.

565 2018-09-20 22:47:28 LWCF has $20 Billion 

YES $20 Billion of unspend funds

And it acrues ca. $1B/yr (oil/gas) 

SO $2B could be allocated annually split between LWCF and Natl Park and Natl Forest maintenance.. I’d suggest 25/75 .. For twenty years!

Modifying legislation req’d 

Great jobs program
566 2018-09-20 22:47:22 It's my first try at watching in a year and a half. 
Turned it off.
Wasn't sure whether to cry or just start burning everything. 
Tonight it was just an indistinguishable clone-robot-Tory who I suspect smelt of some sort of oil and the elephant shit they use to power them
567 2018-09-20 22:47:14 synthetic* oil change 
568 2018-09-20 22:47:06 This oil got me on the moon
569 2018-09-20 22:46:56 Canadian prices:
Barrel of oil  retail gas 
Pork farmgate  pork retail 
Beef farmgate  beef retail 
Milk farmgate  dairy retail 

Seems like there is a pattern here. And it isn't that #SupplyManagement negatively affects retail prices.

572 2018-09-20 22:46:40 He pouted for a week when they shit canned Olive Oil too
573 2018-09-20 22:46:32 I Watched a Doc a long time ago, Anyway they gave away his Pat. more than once, Cancer is like oil, they will talk about getting away from it, but look what there doing to Tesla, there was a guy with some kind of energy beam back in the 30s that would cure cancer, he was killed
574 2018-09-20 22:46:29 So I finally got a bottle of this CBD oil everyone is talking about to help with some issues I've been having for the pass 4 yrs. I hope this works bc im tired of procedures & pills. Wish me luck! 
575 2018-09-20 22:46:28 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
576 2018-09-20 22:46:17 Just used coconut oil as moisturizer and now I finally get why people do it... YOU GET TO SMELL LIKE A FREAKING SNOW CONE!!! #bluecoconut #coconutoil #stillnotaboitthatveganlife #ICouldntBeAnySweeter #hashtag

578 2018-09-20 22:46:01 I can hear the @sciencevs team arguing over who gets to use which essential-oil-related pun in their tweet. So watch out, world
579 2018-09-20 22:45:58 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
580 2018-09-20 22:45:53 You also have to have zero carbon footprint as you indulge in said food.  Think the oil sands don't displace habitat and bear populations.  This bear dying did more financially to ensure more healthy bears in the future then any of these hypocrites ever will
581 2018-09-20 22:45:39 i use this superbalm from lush and a shampoo bar and this coconut oil hair cream for curl control!!!
582 2018-09-20 22:45:33 this easy one, we are giving our oil to the US.
583 2018-09-20 22:45:17 No oil or resources so it’s pretty much useless to US give them independence and in less then 5 years they’ll be like Haiti
584 2018-09-20 22:45:14 Why the evil prevails?
A Heavy Lines ELECTRICIAN (patwari) today explained to me why we dont need dams, he said oil ki bijli banday ko andar say jalaati hai, paani ki bijli to jaan nikalay baghair chhorti nahin!!! Aaj 9 muharram tha, us ki soch per matam karnay ka dil karta hai.
585 2018-09-20 22:45:04 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
586 2018-09-20 22:44:52 Not only is China investing in renewables, they are also investing in   Iranian oil fields and processing. That just got cheaper thanks to   trump.  Again, aren't they the ones who were supposed to buy the tar oil from  the proposed pipeline?
587 2018-09-20 22:44:39 Until Exxon speaks out for legislation or policy that will materially limit the amount of oil and gas they extract and sell, they will get no credit from me.
588 2018-09-20 22:44:37 We spilling some oil this weekend juuuuu hurd?!
589 2018-09-20 22:44:28 Bitch I get free oil changes. I’m good.
590 2018-09-20 22:44:20 Farmers were burning crops of MMJ the other day because it couldn't all be lab tested prior to being processed for oil extraction.

So this mob imports some and that sparks a tulip bulb frenzy? That is nuts. 

How many niche CBD medications FDA approved now? Is it still two?
591 2018-09-20 22:44:10 BURNT THE FUCK OUT OF MY LEG WITH ENGINE OIL :))))))))))
592 2018-09-20 22:44:08 The oil that comes out the vinegarette 
593 2018-09-20 22:44:07 Are you cooking them in coconut oil that’s really good on chicken!!
594 2018-09-20 22:44:06 Yeah man these guys are like rock stara of baseball nerds! The guy they interview seems a bit of a snake oil salesman but makes a lot of sense
595 2018-09-20 22:44:03 The scam is the “toxin and mold free” coffee beans he sells. I can’t imagine what’s wrong with grass fed butter, MCT oil, and regular ole black coffee, though. Obvs not a meal replacement but an effective supplement
596 2018-09-20 22:43:56 At this point I'll take anything different.  I wash my hands before each individual marvel comic read on Wednesdays because even the slightest oil on your hands will warp the paper.  No other publishers books have this problem.  It would be one thing if they were cheaper...
597 2018-09-20 22:43:56 Really want an essential oil diffuser
598 2018-09-20 22:43:48 I look at the oil pipeline/banking dispute in Syria as the most likely place to nuke. Just need a lunatic in the whitehouse.
599 2018-09-20 22:43:44 I use the lush argon oil and rose shampoo bar, then  follow with the aussie 3 minute miracle, then after I’m out of the shower I use the ion miracle spray leave in conditioner and it’s worked for me but I have dry hair
600 2018-09-20 22:43:43 Don’t make fun of Mona Lisa Vito. She’ll cut your oil line. P.S. My Cousin Vinny is used in law schools as a teaching tool.
601 2018-09-20 22:43:34 We all have them. I got multiple burns today from hot frying oil due to an unexpected splashback..
602 2018-09-20 22:43:18 The squeaky wheel get's the oil - they forget about the silent majority
603 2018-09-20 22:43:18 Used to take my van to Mr. Lube or whatnot for an oil change: 10 minutes
Take the new truck to the dealership: hour and a damn half I’ve been sitting here. 
This makes me unreasonably angry.
604 2018-09-20 22:43:09 Right, they're all consuming bucketloads of soybean oil. China also has a higher diabetes rate than the U.S.
605 2018-09-20 22:43:01 Fuck off with your essential oil bull shit.
606 2018-09-20 22:42:56 @TheHestonTeam I know it's possible to infuse Olive Oil with flavours from herbs and spices, but how would you go about infusing it with flavours from things like Shrimp, Prawns and other Shellfish? Similar to what you'd expect from a broth.
607 2018-09-20 22:42:52 The elf acne fighting foundation, believe it or not, is probably the best lightweight full-coverage matte foundation I’ve ever used haha I highly reccomend it, it’s like $5 and it has tea tree oil which is pretty great too
608 2018-09-20 22:42:51 Had metal in my oil. Needed a whole new motor. Now it’s getting paid for completely because of a recall. I am truly blessed.
609 2018-09-20 22:42:44 In Ontario Big Wind is owned by Big Oil & Coal. The major players in Ontario's  wind industry are fossil fuel corporations like Suncor, Enbridge, EPCOR, Capital Power, Veressen and NextEra. Unreliable wind energy is just an enabler for continued use of fossil fuels.
610 2018-09-20 22:42:35 We went to see him Sunday and he asked how my oil was and said you needed yours changed soon lmao
611 2018-09-20 22:42:32 oil is global market
612 2018-09-20 22:42:24 Bought one snake oil ico and one legit one in my time here. Gotta say, the frustration of being a part of the first one is probably worse than the joy the latter brought
613 2018-09-20 22:42:21 Put tariffs on their oil. Teach them a lesson
614 2018-09-20 22:42:18 What has actually happened is the executives have executed the classic pump and dump. 

A) Executives got long 
B) Executives lied about oil in the well
C) Executives offloaded shares onto the deceived public for huge profits.
615 2018-09-20 22:42:01 I did a bust too 00:  and yea oil pastels were fun but a bit messy 
616 2018-09-20 22:41:36 Tell you something I’d take what we seen tonight every single time. 3 points in Europe and scenes at the end, over getting pasted by some rich Arab oil mob
617 2018-09-20 22:41:27 Warm water + argan oil.
618 2018-09-20 22:41:18 Yeah, I put bio oil on my back every day
619 2018-09-20 22:41:17 Oh no, so sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon How did you and Maggie sleep last night? Have you noticed any change yet with the CBD oil?
620 2018-09-20 22:41:16 Yes now punish them with tariffs on their oil
621 2018-09-20 22:41:14 I feel you!! Get on it and apply it every night, I’ve heard Jamaican black castor oil is good also but I tried it once and near blinded myself hahahah
622 2018-09-20 22:41:06 seeing a fucking advert by SHELL yes the oil company being like "we support women in the workplace UwU" like ur an evil fucking oil company lol
SHELL: "Girls TOO can make money through the destruction of our planet!!"
623 2018-09-20 22:40:59 shu uemura makes the best hair oil fuck. y is it $70
624 2018-09-20 22:40:51 I mean.. It sounds like the truth.
625 2018-09-20 22:40:44 tea tree oil
626 2018-09-20 22:40:35 Who Got Da Oil On Decc? I Aint Spendin More Than  25 Tho
627 2018-09-20 22:40:17 Getting my oil changed and I can hear homie yelling about missing bolts from my whip and I’m gonna kill somebody
628 2018-09-20 22:40:08 Price controls on foodstuffs, yes, though I don't think they're the main cause. Protectionism, on the other hand, I'm much more sceptical about. The reason why the fall in world oil prices adversely affected Venezuela is because it was heavily reliant on oil.
629 2018-09-20 22:40:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
630 2018-09-20 22:40:05 Commodities 20/9/2018

632 2018-09-20 22:39:21 But higher prices means more $ for our domestic oil companies, who love you. If you make prices drop then they will stop
SAD LOW IQ MAGA
633 2018-09-20 22:39:19 You go Medea! idiots who only care about oil and their relationships with bullies want to keep lying. So sick of the USA meddling, look at Iraq, look at Libya, look at Syria and Yemen! Poor Yemenis!. I’m so sick.

635 2018-09-20 22:39:04 Why does Dan have pampers and baby oil in his bathroom cabinet? #TheCircle
636 2018-09-20 22:39:02 This is a very interesting one. I would say based on some of the nominations The Player, Lorenzo's Oil, and long shots Aladdin & A River Runs Through It(which i wouldn't agree with the last one).
637 2018-09-20 22:38:40 Is this a serious question? The answer is OIL. Well, oil and regional strategy.
638 2018-09-20 22:38:31 Twitter I love you. But I can’t stand how people recycle tweets for RTs. I’ve seen the Drake Millie stranger Ting from 4 different people and the oil change tweet 3 times today 
639 2018-09-20 22:38:19 my dude if you give me your car I will take it to get the oil changed
640 2018-09-20 22:38:16 Lmfaooo @chalecki08 tweeted that but yess lmfaoo you always need an oil change girl
641 2018-09-20 22:38:10 The only thing they're smeared with is oil from hair I pulled out from the experience of Intel HD not being able to run porn games properly
642 2018-09-20 22:38:07 So we just not going to acknowledge my guy @Yelawolf didn't drop some hot cooked oil fire on that man @machinegunkelly @Eminem army rising out of the grave like the Michael Jackson thriller video. All this white on white crimes     can't we all just get along?
643 2018-09-20 22:38:06 Oh women can certainly learn to be technicians. But they typically don’t. You couldn’t find a more male dominated industry if you tried. In terms of oil changes though, any idiot with 2 brain cells can do one
644 2018-09-20 22:37:54 @nailogical does cooking oil actually fry you nails instantly??? This lady sprayed them on her nails and it works but you are the true scientist and I need your opinion.
645 2018-09-20 22:37:52 It does work, you don't peel the clove, the oil breaks down wax and the garlic has antibiotic properties.
646 2018-09-20 22:37:28 my parents were gifted with tiger balm infused with cbd oil a while ago. THAT shits amazing
647 2018-09-20 22:36:52 Soo like I was helping my mom cook and the hot hot oil jumps on my skin and like yea not have it it today
648 2018-09-20 22:36:39 Occam's razor seemingly went out when hipster beards came in.

sidebar: there's beard oil? tell me more.
649 2018-09-20 22:36:30 Wrong little Marco ! 
Do your job. You are a senator not a snake oil sales man .
For God sake you belong to a Racist Party&your leader is a racist Neo Nazi, sexual predator, and Russian Puppet.
Leave Theology to the real theologians. 
Republicans agenda is not Jesus's Agenda .
650 2018-09-20 22:36:24 “Since he (Gustavo Espinosa Mireles) personally favored German deals, he told the German economic counselor in Mexico, Burandt, that President Cárdenas had secretly agreed to sell oil to Germany, as long as the negotiations would be conducted by a non-German company.”
651 2018-09-20 22:36:23 Jadi berangkatkah? nanti di indo kl mau cobain pake essential oil buat boost imunnya 
Lekas sehat ya Eri kawaii..
652 2018-09-20 22:36:09 My essential oil hobby has slowly morphed into an obsession sos
653 2018-09-20 22:36:07 At Summa today for evaluation. A woman comes in puking her guts out because she took castor oil to start labor... Dr "you realize that's an old wives tale right??" Woman "Now you tell me...and what is a wives tale?" As she's barfing non stop!! Sigh. They give babies to anyone. 
654 2018-09-20 22:35:47 I’m reminded of why Fenty Pro Filt’r foundation is such a hit. Controls oil, has a beautiful finish and DOES NOT SETTLE INTO FINE LINES. 
Such a beauty!
655 2018-09-20 22:35:46 Wow took my car in for oil change and diagnostic test they run the diagnostic test and totally forgot my oil change I took it in at 8 this morning and just picked it up 30 minutes ago wow just wow!!!
656 2018-09-20 22:35:41 i dont care about thc oil pens or snap stories advertising them
657 2018-09-20 22:35:19 Ok, we are paying (bills) for that protection, if you are not happy with high Oil price, ask for more (tipping)
658 2018-09-20 22:35:07 oil is more then just a fuel
659 2018-09-20 22:35:04 This is a silly conversation. No one is saying we can immediately give up oil. But this administration is pushing us BACKWARDS.
660 2018-09-20 22:35:01 Democrats have the media in their pockets; banks, the NRA, and oil companies have the Republicans in their pockets. You really want to go down this road?
661 2018-09-20 22:34:39 Instead of gettin a good rest for tomorrow,  I'm here reading jokes! ‍‍If I don't prove to those mfers that I discovered oil tmar,  my PowerPoint ne va pas justifier mon stage.
662 2018-09-20 22:34:39 Today's lesson. not coming words...
秋分の日　Autumnal Equinox Day
二酸化炭素　carbon dioxide
軽油　light oil
振替休日　substitute holiday
月曜日は秋分の日の振替休日で、今週末は三連休だ
Next Monday is a substitute holiday for autumnal equinox day, and I have 3 holidays in a low.
663 2018-09-20 22:34:19 The GDP of the entire continent of Africa including oil rich Nigeria and the mineral wealth of SA and Angola is less than that of France.
That's a fact you can go check.
664 2018-09-20 22:34:14 finally hopped on the CBD oil bandwagon i’m excited for the benefits
665 2018-09-20 22:34:14 Is it permanent reduction of 5 cents or due to oil markets? In Quebec it’s cheaper than Ontario even with carbon tax
666 2018-09-20 22:34:06 I have not seen a son of a harlot like you
You are like a child getting what he wants
We want the interest of our country just like you and our country's interest in rising oil prices and you speak like a terrorist  not a president
667 2018-09-20 22:33:48 A homeopathic practitioner new patient of mine told me I would be clevererererer if I’d never had fluoride and that she healed some of her cavities,completely healed, with coconut oil. All I could say was ‘ok’
668 2018-09-20 22:33:34 Drink hot water with honey, lemon, and turmeric. It’s disgusting. Also, add a couple drops of tea tree oil into hot water water and breathe in the steam.
669 2018-09-20 22:33:31 Wall Street and oil and gas companies are also socialists.
670 2018-09-20 22:33:30 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
671 2018-09-20 22:33:20 Boeing aerospace, Detroit auto industry, Oil companies, all  #subsidized for a lot more. Tesla has paid back gov loan with interest...and will be successful.
672 2018-09-20 22:33:09 @mikebettes That video from Colorado you have been showing I can let you know that the white stuff on the road is actually road film from oil and other liquids foaming up in the rain.  Extremely slick
673 2018-09-20 22:33:06 You are such a scam artist and snake oil salesmen, pathetic.
674 2018-09-20 22:33:05 Got my nails done yesterday and putting oil in my car all by myself today. Not to be conceited or anything but I’m a #boss.
675 2018-09-20 22:32:46 Unexpected? I don’t think so. Oil companies jumping on the environmentally friendly bandwagon to make them look clean & shiny. #wolfinsheepsclothing
676 2018-09-20 22:32:27 We, humans, Canadians.

If you burn oil you contribute to the killing of animals. Climate change is expected to wipe out an 1/8th of all bird species for example.
677 2018-09-20 22:32:26 I once got rid of earache using a remedy I read about, a clove of garlic dipped into olive oil. Shame I left it in when I went to the shop....
678 2018-09-20 22:32:25 I love coconut oil  I use it literally from head to toe 
679 2018-09-20 22:32:05 Lmao sakarkarai sunyi yawa a twitter
680 2018-09-20 22:32:02 Tried? I'd say they are pretty successful in fisting us all with that pipeline to nowhere. Real bunch of American patriots those Albertans are. Billions in Canadian taxpayers dollars going to US oil exec bonuses.
681 2018-09-20 22:31:59 Yea not too surprising . Oil/gas & finance will usually always trend at the top. I’ve heard wages and hours at Amazon & Tesla isn’t what everyone expects
682 2018-09-20 22:31:43 Now this I can back you behind, but cut the tough talk. We both know you're not pulling troops from our investment....I mean their oil reserves. If they set it on fire today, we'll be there tomorrow like back in Desert Storm.
683 2018-09-20 22:31:17 Why are you @ me I stress about oil more than you
684 2018-09-20 22:31:10 After President Trump blast at OPEC, oil prices fell two- months high, ended 0.4% lower at $70.80 a barrel
685 2018-09-20 22:30:59 America uses 25 percent of the worlds oil is why
686 2018-09-20 22:30:53 Water and oil don’t mix
687 2018-09-20 22:30:45 They'll start with oil! Then when we switch to solar they'll block the sun! We should power our vehicles by American Coal. It's good for the environment and keeps jobs here!!! #MAGA
688 2018-09-20 22:30:33 I have no oil in my car and my oil change isn’t scheduled till October... sooooooo wtf do I do

691 2018-09-20 22:30:19 Butter or olive oil for me.
692 2018-09-20 22:30:16 You’ll not be safe that MIDDLE EAST countries decide to sell their oil by another currency  chill out 
693 2018-09-20 22:30:10 I’ll look for it. I remember buying MU at 11 for long term hold to 35..but sold it for a small loss because I needed the cash to buy triple leverage oil ETNs which proceeded to take a 45% draw down and never recovered. I’m fine though
694 2018-09-20 22:30:10 we have our own oil reserves here in the US some never been tapped we need to do that instead of relying on them
695 2018-09-20 22:30:07 Dirty motor oil.

698 2018-09-20 22:29:57 Trust me you gonna find simsim oil for the babe and oxytocin for the mother lol
699 2018-09-20 22:29:53 How about we upgrade our technology and stop using oil, what’s the problem!
700 2018-09-20 22:29:26 Yeah it’s perforated, in fucking agony, can’t eat anything cooked in oil or high fat until it’s out... I’ll be first in the queue once it’s gone haha 
701 2018-09-20 22:29:22 you offer nothing... you are a snake oil salesman trying to con the public
702 2018-09-20 22:28:59 Thanks for stepping up . Your the only one with the courage to help working people out with high gas / heating oil prices. 
How about hold off aid to their countries until a barrel of oil is $20.00 less. Home heating oil might skyrocket this winter if they keep creeping $ up.
703 2018-09-20 22:28:46 If the Arab countries decided to sell the oil in euro, but in US Dollar, The American economy will collapse in a second.
704 2018-09-20 22:28:42 Tengo que aprender a soltar lo que me hace mal
705 2018-09-20 22:28:41 I usually rub 2-3 drops of lavender essential oil into my forehead. Not a quick fix, but I does help shorten my downtime.
706 2018-09-20 22:28:38 The idea that oil, oil & companies are ethical is laughable. 
Yes we are an oil rich region and our record is better than many, but oil is far from ethical nor were conservative governments that robbed Albertans of royalties in favour of corporate friends. #ableg
707 2018-09-20 22:28:16 I am in Houston, TX.  Lots of people here, not me tho, financially benefit when the price of crude oil is high.  Just saying...

710 2018-09-20 22:27:26 I keep hearing what a wonderful Pres. the snake oil salesman Obama is .. R these people uneducated or brainwashed. What legacy did he leave behind besides all his records are sealed. Mr Transparency himself transgender bathrooms & a $20 trillion debt.More than all ex P’s 2gether
711 2018-09-20 22:27:23 they give delicious and versatile olive oil, sooo..
712 2018-09-20 22:27:16 Me too. The former Minster of Defense for Canada came out about ET among many others...(over 300) from military, government and classified programs about ET vehicles and technologies. The big question is, what is their energy source and why are we using oil? Answer:$200 Trillion
713 2018-09-20 22:27:08 This is just absurd.  Make Monday her day...yes or no.  No more terms.
714 2018-09-20 22:27:03 Beto is taking no pac money. Cruz is bought by the NRA and big oil. #VoteBeto
715 2018-09-20 22:27:02 “French politicians, facing a powerful Germany, did not want to endanger proven, long-term British oil supplies in exchange for Mexican oil.”
716 2018-09-20 22:27:01 Truffle oil burger patty, bitch. Try that.
717 2018-09-20 22:26:54 The price of oil is up because of all the threats, chaos, terror, and wars that the US have created in the middle east starting with the invasion of Iraq. You want lower prices? Stay away from the middle east and the whole world will be better and prices will go down.
718 2018-09-20 22:26:53 There is something added to the oil that goes in for pens that makes it a little more runny but i cant remember what it is
719 2018-09-20 22:26:37 i rub your temples and offer you some peppermint oil :( i love YOU!! im doing homework too. we can do this...
720 2018-09-20 22:26:31 Because...profits for defense contractors, stockholders and, of course, oil. #StopWarNow
721 2018-09-20 22:26:20 Why are "gods" in most religions such whiny little BITCHES! 

oooh you didn't kiss my ass 7 times in between two half moons! well fuck you, I'm gonna throw you in boiling oil for ever!

WTF!
722 2018-09-20 22:26:18 Braggs makes apple cider vinegar and olive oil based dressings.
723 2018-09-20 22:26:10 We need more. I think the next thing your government should do is enact a price justification program. What I mean is that oil/gas companies would have to file a public report explaining why the price is going up. If they can't justify it, no increase.

726 2018-09-20 22:25:57 It is being said you have beaten your wife and you are worried about a hashtag.  They didn't name the bottom feeding fish, a carp, for nothing.  So sad, so vile....resign !!

728 2018-09-20 22:25:42 My charges are possession, supply & manufacture of cannabis oil and cannabis resin. It is equivalent to the manufacture of ice in their opinion.  In the eyes of the law there doesn't need to be a human victim to charge me.

730 2018-09-20 22:25:33 The funnies one was “god made every oil to serve as a cure for sins that get us sick” Are there any resources or articles that address the bs claims that oils make or their lack of research showing they do anything? Crap drives me nuts
731 2018-09-20 22:25:28 Yes!! This is oil so brack!!! so brack!!!
732 2018-09-20 22:25:24 Here is the thing Mr. President, if we were focusing more on renewable energy oil prices would not be such an issue. Really, let's put money into energy, wind, and solar and we could all have sustainable energy at lower cost. Seems like a fairly easy fix.

734 2018-09-20 22:25:21 Because those pages of the 09/11 commission are still classified.  Even though the guy’s last name is the same family as the biggest oil wealth holders in Saudi, probably a coincidence.
735 2018-09-20 22:25:06 Summit County Peeps....I fear my knee might finally be giving up and is causing pain, even after Aleve, CBD oil, icing.  I do have a name for an Ortho doc at UH, but would like recommendations for knee surgeons at Crystal Clinic.  Dr. Bear did my left knee, but he is getting on.
736 2018-09-20 22:24:56 I’ve come to realize that people just aren’t aware. No one ever told them about oil changes  or when to get them or how to pay attention to signs on the car. I know I still have things to learn about my car but at least I manage my own oil changes.
737 2018-09-20 22:24:43 In this case big saving! Shale oil data is not complete. And we're supposed to believe energy market will remain As Is!

744 2018-09-20 22:23:56 Energy security and Israeli lobby influence. Saudis can be tamed on oil and Israeli policy, Iran not. Iran needs to reform, not go nuclear and stop non-sense Jewish hate. Of course Nuclear Israel has no moral authority to ask stop Iran going nuclear.
745 2018-09-20 22:23:55 I don’t know how to check my oil or even know if I need one 
746 2018-09-20 22:23:46 Oil! We need to invest in science and achieve infinitely sustainable green energy from nuclear fusion. This will solve so many of the Earth’s problems with pollution and scarcity. And we wouldn’t e so obliged to do business with a repressive society...
747 2018-09-20 22:23:45 Oil will always be on the top. Even with basseh the oil remains on top.

754 2018-09-20 22:22:44 I’ve read in several places Russia needed two things to improve its economy: 

1) western sanctions removed 

2) oil prices raised (prices slid from $108 in 2013 to $30 in 2016) 

Trump was thwarted on #1 but doesn’t placing sanctions on Iran fulfill #2?

764 2018-09-20 22:21:41 I've used both. I prefer the oil for no reason except it feels more expensive
765 2018-09-20 22:21:26 So far, there have been three people on this thread.  None of us have said pipelines are safe or that we prefer (in this case) oil to any other source of energy.

I think we agreed: 
Pipelines must be subject to the same levels of safety requirements as nuclear power plants.

772 2018-09-20 22:20:30 @PnPCBC is discussing bitumen. James Moore is in his Harperite mode. He claims bitumen is identical with Canada.

776 2018-09-20 22:20:14 We wouldn't be in this situation if you guys hadn't campaigned against Nuclear power. Tech has improved A LOT since the Chernobyl-era, there is no reason to have discarded it.

793 2018-09-20 22:18:34 Better Men have tried to get oil prices down. The only thing that seems to work is when U.S. makes & sells cars with better gas millage. OPEC gets nervous we may not need them as much as we did, and then they entice us with lower prices. Threats don't work. Better Men have tried.

831 2018-09-20 22:13:31 Dat senator na person wey dem wan roast wey come use palm oil rub body.

834 2018-09-20 22:13:11 現在進行形で頭ｺﾞﾝｯｺﾞﾝｯってぶつけてるんだけどいい加減うるさいから起きてほしい
835 2018-09-20 22:13:06 I do not mean to sound harsh but the majority of Aberdonians do not work in the oil industry nor related services and they find it really hard in Aberdeen most expensive place to live next to London
836 2018-09-20 22:13:05 Articulated dumps are rather slow, use a lot of fuel, and require a lot of maintenance (oil and filter change every 100 hours of run time).  They make sense for something to operate off road, ie in armoured units, but for a motorised or 8x8 type of unit a truck makes more sense
837 2018-09-20 22:12:54 Guys I have 0% oil life
838 2018-09-20 22:12:54 Watch @mrlube staff in North Vancouver when they change your car engine oil. Apparently they don’t change the filter! After over a month following up, the management don’t even bother to call and reimburse me. Very bad customer service.
839 2018-09-20 22:12:46 Logic = the massive benefit to government coffers and provincial GDP...the ROI is epic in financial terms. The subsidy narrative makes it sound like pallets of cash are sent to oil companies in the hopes that they grace us with their presence....and that’s simply not the case. .
840 2018-09-20 22:12:42 You don't have to subtweet me.  You can just say you don't want to come to my beard oil party/pyramid scheme.
841 2018-09-20 22:12:36 What about our own oil?
842 2018-09-20 22:12:35 I'm going to have to MISS a few skaters (including probably Evgenia GRR) thanks to my Dad decided to get his oil changed and him getting his own dinner, so Mom wants to go out....
843 2018-09-20 22:12:33 The saving grace of Nigeria is oil 
Kenya, Ethiopia and other African countries have a steady economic growth rate and if they continue like this, they would be richer than Nigeria in the next ten years. Never seen a country with so much lacks in management #nigeria #nigeriaair
844 2018-09-20 22:12:24 try lavender essential oil! Ive also had problems sleeping early this year and it really helped me a lot. I bought mine from healthy options!

847 2018-09-20 22:11:52 I went like 7-8 months with out a oil change 
848 2018-09-20 22:11:49 It’s also a fundamental error in how labor markets in the US work. (Eg the current laws incentivize creating an underclass, and the labor market isn’t some single fungible system like say, oil or wheat)
849 2018-09-20 22:11:32 電車で隣に座ってる成人男性が寝てるんだけどその人の頭が後ろにある窓にぶつかっては前に倒れまた窓にぶつかって前に倒れてって繰り返してて滅茶苦茶笑うのを抑えてるんですけど窓に頭がぶつかる度にｺﾞﾝｯって結構鈍い音鳴っててなんでこいつ起きねえんだろうっていうきもち
850 2018-09-20 22:11:20 i made noodles yesterday and accidentally put LIME olive oil on them and now i just don’t know what to do with them bc well... they’re just nasty.
851 2018-09-20 22:10:47 You can also take a warm bath with eucalyptus and peppermint oil to help soothe the pain/ itching. Also go to the hospital and wait.

"Running a government isnt like running Irving oil" 
#ohdamn #throwingshade
860 2018-09-20 22:10:09 We produce the oil here, sell it to OPEC, they sell it back to use with inflated prices, it's refined here and sold to the American people at outrageous prices. 

Why not produce it and refine it then sell to the American people at realistic prices?

864 2018-09-20 22:10:04 Not much of a guard. Why is he there again?
865 2018-09-20 22:09:59 It's all about the reserves when recoverable oil is giving the 'sucking' sound of emptying...
And Iran has massive reserves...
Understanding the game yet even?
Shale is shit.....
866 2018-09-20 22:09:47 no outro dia estava pedrado e meti um video chamado Dubai's Plan to Outlive Oil no meu watch later
867 2018-09-20 22:09:32 Sad I’m not at Lucas Oil tonight.. see ya tomorrow, Lake Waters! 
868 2018-09-20 22:09:31 Your wcw still use baby powder and baby oil
869 2018-09-20 22:09:28 The oxen drank up every drop of a bone; but she heard all about it, but she poured oil on and walked, till she heard that
870 2018-09-20 22:08:58 Totally agree with you, renewable energy is the only way to go. Also affordable electric cars will definitely reduce the need for oil.
871 2018-09-20 22:08:58 Yo that CBD oil tho

Customer: "Does this work?"
Spa Employee: "It... Uhh... It has some kind of... Effect."
Customer: "I'm convinced, let's give it a go".
876 2018-09-20 22:08:34 Definition of mellow: warmed, relaxed. CBD oil brings you down to a calmer, more relaxed state with NO high. I've not tried it myself, but have met folks who've found great relief with it. As someone who has near-stroke level blood pressure due to anxiety, I'm considering it too.
877 2018-09-20 22:08:33 If you need your brakes or oil changed better hit me up while I-95 down cause when that bitch open back up I’m gone
878 2018-09-20 22:08:30 A friend who got breast cancer young, stopped all treatment because she believed Frankincense oil would cure her. Sadly when she went back for scans it had spread every where. I have the same contempt for sellers of alt remedies that I have for anti-vaxxers.
879 2018-09-20 22:08:28 Not one from the major oil producing countries.
880 2018-09-20 22:08:23 What "victory"? Afghanistan is a natural resource, like oil or coal, from which the American warmongers extract continual profits.
881 2018-09-20 22:08:22 Lol I didn't mention anybody ooo, I just said a fucking shot on an iPhone x
882 2018-09-20 22:08:14 Yea they are greedy and want to make us pay more at the pump to like their pockets. We can make our own oil.
883 2018-09-20 22:08:07 There are some real predatory assholes in the legal marketing world. Judgmental snake oil types trying to alpha male everybody. Why? Shaming lawyers into buying things by making them feel dumb is an odd strategy.
884 2018-09-20 22:07:56 Going to Franklin TN to get that Beard Oil Supply and Chill!!!
885 2018-09-20 22:07:55 pls tell me ur using vegetable oil and not olive oil
886 2018-09-20 22:07:55 Should-be daily reminder that Venezuela is the most oil rich country in the world and if you were skeptical of the Iraq war you should be skeptical about regime change talk in Venezuela.
887 2018-09-20 22:07:53 Or, we could not depend on them for oil
888 2018-09-20 22:07:51 More important: @ 145 ppm CO2 all  life dies; @ 1000 ppm CO2 plantlife thrives; trap CO2 in earth, sediment, natural gas, oil and limestone  = remove it from circulating  troposphere.  We are at 400???
889 2018-09-20 22:07:39 Dude beard oil is legit.
890 2018-09-20 22:07:38 Pro tip: don’t mow in tanning oil
891 2018-09-20 22:07:37 Or we can start passing legislation to get companies to use clean alternative fuels with tax cuts and incentives so we can stop relying on foreign oil. Electric is the future
892 2018-09-20 22:07:34 Do it girl! It’ll be a life saver. I have cluster migraines at least twice a day and the peppermint oil helps so much
893 2018-09-20 22:07:33 Yeah they work on commission... I brought up the transfer case because they got me on that once. The cap is magnetic to pick up little metal filings. So these guys just wipe their finger on the cap and onto the oil display thing so it looks much worse than it actually is.
894 2018-09-20 22:07:28 Is essential oil even okay to consume?!
895 2018-09-20 22:07:23 Works great for my nerves, however I pull the oil out and eat that
896 2018-09-20 22:06:58 The fragrance is unbelievable! I would like to smell it on you. I'm going to look for perfume or an oil of it.
897 2018-09-20 22:06:55 Yea I’ll bake my vegi’s in that oil all day
898 2018-09-20 22:06:47 Turbo sound like a kettle is boiling. I've been caning it gotta put oil in. I made your girl get the coil in. No, really; just for my enjoyment
899 2018-09-20 22:06:27 coconut oil with shea butter be having me smelling like peach cobbler

901 2018-09-20 22:05:50 Prolly canola oil
902 2018-09-20 22:05:47 It’s a little ridiculous because everytime he tells me to check my oil, it’s low 
903 2018-09-20 22:05:42 MANY THINGS like pollution, littering, wasting electricity, not recycling... theres a lot of industries that destroy habitats for oil or paper. And we’re not helping by supporting those companies.
904 2018-09-20 22:05:41 Appoint a team to analyze imports for $10B cut 
Agri 5Bill. Substitute. 
Cars over 1800cc. minor Duty not enough. 
Gas. Equalize 
Textile sub for Yarn. 
Oil Cut electric production. 
Subsidize Solar farms 
Much more 
IK explain emergency.
905 2018-09-20 22:05:39 reduce all of the drilling regulations in our country, reduce all export regulations on oil, coal and gas. our competition with OPEC will drive prices down.
906 2018-09-20 22:05:27 calm yo ass you be the last nigga doing your own oil change
907 2018-09-20 22:05:23 Big oil need not frame Elon.  He has made huge blunders on his own. 

Big oil will only ensure that pressure is applied,  and he is not let off the hook (which being filthy rich, he might have been able to do)

$TSLA $TSLAQ
908 2018-09-20 22:05:13 On the real I should probably start putting oil in my hair again because not putting anything in it
IS NOT CUTTING IT ANYMORE.
909 2018-09-20 22:05:09 We should take all profit from Iraq's oil sales, or at least a large percentage.
910 2018-09-20 22:04:55 Potent CBD oil is still Just CBD oil though and has no psychoactive effects. No matter how potent or how much you use you will never be high.
911 2018-09-20 22:04:52 I turn oil into rock call me jesus
912 2018-09-20 22:04:46 anyways, I ordered a bunch of stuff so that I can just make my own facial oil.

914 2018-09-20 22:04:24 cant stop thinking about how the tweet that said "get an oil change" made me get an oil change

918 2018-09-20 22:03:52 Ladies: make a scrub with 2 parts ground coffee, one part ground cinnamon, and enough coconut oil to wet the mixture, and exfoliate any problem area (cellulite, stretch marks, scars, etc) leave on while you wash your hair and shave. Will fade any marks and eliminate cellulite 
919 2018-09-20 22:03:46 Lmao I told my dad I got CBD oil and he went “what if you have to pass a drug test, you’ll fail” like uh that’s not how that works
920 2018-09-20 22:03:38 Just Keep It Wash & Oil
921 2018-09-20 22:03:28 I wonder if it was gluten + margarine on the bread or veg oil on the pasta etc... I would love to see that! I wonder if it has an acceleration effect... you would think so! My husband, type 1, said his mother lived on bread, esp when pregnant due to morning sickness.
922 2018-09-20 22:03:22 You could spend hours looking at and learning about different types of lube. Literally. There's:

926 2018-09-20 22:02:51 You pulled out of the deal with Iran one of the biggest oil traders in OIL, do you expect a reward for that? You sold Saudi Arabia weapons you didn’t give them them for free. You say you were a business man, no wonder you went bankrupt 6 times.
927 2018-09-20 22:02:33 Bound i use bkz they have 1st priority to buy the oil from SA. And no investors could invest their business unless they have huge amiunt of benefits.
928 2018-09-20 22:02:32 Invest in electric transportation infrastructure such as EV charging stations, it will solve both climate change and oil monopoly issues!

929 2018-09-20 22:02:20 Yes, plenty of yachts and private planes were purchased. Groceries and gas for most citizens not so much. Pay raises are eaten up by increasing inflation. Sale your snake oil on Fox.

954 2018-09-20 22:00:19 I work in outdoor rec. outdoor rec in the US makes more revenue than oil! So why are you killing us! Protect parks! Protect outdoor spaces! Work to stop climate change! What’s going to happen when NC’s coast moves inland? Or the beaches are fouled with oil? That’s lost revenue!
955 2018-09-20 22:00:13 Change intervals:

959 2018-09-20 21:59:54 He based his financials on 4 year record high oil prices of $120. Recklessness on monumental scale. It costs $44 to get it to market whereas Saudi $10. Current price $70.
960 2018-09-20 21:59:48 Tried to do "oil pulling" on my teeth with coconut oil.  You're supposed to do it for 20 minutes, I made it two.  How can anyone keep their mouth shut for 20 minutes, that's beyond me.
961 2018-09-20 21:59:37 Strictly speaking, Exxon only controls about 3% or 4% of the world's oil reserves, even though it's the largest publicly held company.

But I get the point.

965 2018-09-20 21:59:29 Had Scotland became independent at around the same time Norway started its sovereign wealth fund from North Sea oil, and copied the model , it would have 1.5 Trillion dollars in the bank, not talk of a non existing 13 billion pound deficit.

966 2018-09-20 21:59:17 Honestly a bake potatoe is baked a fry is cut and fried in oil ..So a potato is still a potato no matter how it's cooked
967 2018-09-20 21:59:02 This is so true, I still haven’t gotten my oil changed 
968 2018-09-20 21:58:54 Another great @theSNP policy... How is the "oil thing", the "bridge thing", the "NHS thing", the "education thing" @NicolaSturgeon... Time for a deflective sound bite...??
969 2018-09-20 21:58:39 Well I have no idea who sent me that cbd oil a few weeks ago, but whoever you are, you are helping keep me alive rn so I'm sending you a million spirit kisses.
970 2018-09-20 21:58:34 Super cool that a pipeline that pumps oil through Iowa is critical infrastructure vital to the public good of the state and that the sun’s energy is a private resource.
971 2018-09-20 21:58:15 Pink Pepper- Emily Wright said they held back some of the info for now... so blessed to have this oil!!
972 2018-09-20 21:58:13 What's even more crazy is that our wars are going to enrich the pockets of corporate and oil interests.  The deaths of these people serve no just cause, we are not fighting to make the world a better place.  They get richer and lose people we love.
973 2018-09-20 21:57:59 Try castor oil
974 2018-09-20 21:57:58 Find a car wash with underbody wash. Oil from the skunk can spread across the road and get kicked up underneath.
975 2018-09-20 21:57:56 Didn’t ur engine blow years ago because u needed an oil change?!?
976 2018-09-20 21:57:50 But the USA is the world's third largest producer of oil (after your friends Saudi Arabia and Russia).  High oil prices help the USA.

979 2018-09-20 21:57:42 The decline in union work in the oil and gas industry started long before this government. The Conservative government laid the foundation for where we are now.

985 2018-09-20 21:57:01 I bought a Suisin carbon steel blade recently. I can skin a tomato with it but since it's carbon steel I have to wash and oil it immediately. Knives like these are works of art. Congrats! Beautiful knife.
986 2018-09-20 21:57:00 Idk what boy trying to act like my dad needs to hear this but 

I just got an oil change
987 2018-09-20 21:56:59 The only thing I can think of to use that for is dumping it in a non-aqueous liquid with glitter or something, and using it like a lava lamp.....

Eating it would be a waste. And potentially toxic. Especially in snake oil concoctions.

999 2018-09-20 21:55:57 Correct about no work or revenue but, as I said, imagine needing to continue running the pumps and paying all the expenses and doing all the work but the oil pumped up is dumped. Instead, oil is kept in the ground and expenses are cut until things calm down.
1000 2018-09-20 21:55:50 I’m talking about AK. Wheeler is the Gov of AK. Alaska is a Red State but no one is creating or expanding industry in AK to produce more jobs.  Seasonal fishing is their main industry while oil is sliding, at least for the moment.  Fish Farming is growing. AK is loaded with

1003 2018-09-20 21:55:33 Oh wait...in Seville they gave us a bottles of olive oil and a small bottle of wine from local growers. Worst part was there was no tote bag on offer to lug it all around in.

1022 2018-09-20 21:53:32 US funds re-badged AlQaeda & most other terrorist groups to overthrow the secular gov of Syria, as do their buddies, the head-choppin’ Saudis. US sells arms to Saudis who give them to terrorists. Blood for oil. ISIS was born of US-caused chaos in the Middle East.
1023 2018-09-20 21:53:31 @realDonaldTrump Produce more us oil  and stop calling germans nazis , proud to be german and support russia, and ban smoking and hemp

1031 2018-09-20 21:52:34 Bit simplistic. You try living with Fibromyalgia for 26 yrs. would've been totally bed bound without Morphine. Having said that you should make a follow up on CBD oil. Brilliant stuff. The legal stuff, not With THC.
1032 2018-09-20 21:52:12 And in the Mexican case? Or when the Chinese, Indians or even  non-Venezuelan refineries in Texas buy Venezuelan crude oil? Oil is the most fungible commodity in the world once it is given access to to the global market via oil tankers.

1038 2018-09-20 21:51:20 It just hit me that I am 25 after filling out my service survey from my oil change because I no longer fit into the under 25 bracket. I do not know how I feel about this new realization.

1051 2018-09-20 21:49:57 Just remind them that "You and Only YOU" did the sword dance!  They must chop the oil prices.
1052 2018-09-20 21:49:46 Is that the 1.5 million they are spending to make appear human.
1053 2018-09-20 21:49:44 I still wonder how oil companies in Nigeria pay 85% of their taxable income and still manage to survive. Could they be understating profits? It baffles me tbvh.
1054 2018-09-20 21:49:42 CBD oil is looking like the move for my anxiety.

1091 2018-09-20 21:44:21 I’m on the fence about that oil change tweet because on one hand it was extremely sexist but on the other hand, I’m a huge dumbass and know nothing about routine car maintenance lol
1092 2018-09-20 21:44:21 why the hell did ohio outlaw cbd/hemp oil?
there’s absolutely no psychoactive qualities present in cbd. it helps with pain, anxiety, and sleep issues AND was readily available due to no legislation existing
but now it’s outlawed, so the negative stigma will remain
fuck big pharma
1093 2018-09-20 21:44:14 It's not tea tree tbf its from white paperbark I think and it smells very much like eucalyptus but it's more intense. We have a decongestant brand here (dunno if you have it in Aus) called Olbas Oil which contains cajeput as well as eucalyptus.

1100 2018-09-20 21:43:48 We need to reduce our dependence on oil, this will reduce our carbon footprint and will also mean that Americans can no longer force their politics onto the rest of the world.
1101 2018-09-20 21:43:44 I understand charging someone for a service (my oil change) because people (like myself) are too lazy to do it themselves but oil and a filter is like $40 tops not $93 @Valvoline

1108 2018-09-20 21:43:17 NO. Chapter 6 where 75% of our oil and 50% of out gas must be made available to Americans is CRAZY. Then provinces with shortage of oil must buy it back from Americans is INSANE. 

Kill Chapter 6, that even the Mexican refused.

1109 2018-09-20 21:43:15 Thankful for CBD oil today
1110 2018-09-20 21:43:15 CBD oil is the new bcaas of the supplement industry
1111 2018-09-20 21:43:13 Oh, so now the President is involved with big oil?  Stop watching MSLSD!
1112 2018-09-20 21:43:11 It isn't an event, it is a permanent feature since May.

If it was a month, almost no one would get a ship because the oil cost is tremendous and you need a week minimum to unlock a ship. You'll take a month usually to finish one.
1113 2018-09-20 21:43:11 NEW CUT, NEW SHOES, NEW OIL CHANGE, NEW PACK. I’m lit
1114 2018-09-20 21:43:08 Lay on your front first, so I can do your back *looking you up and down as I pour some oil onto my hands*
1115 2018-09-20 21:43:02 We have the technology now to rid ourselves completely of our need for crude oil.  The elite have imposed their economic agenda on working class Citizens around the globe. When the oil producers of the world make money, so do their shareholders (e.i. Trump).
1116 2018-09-20 21:43:00 While September oil exports to South Korea have not yet picked up steam so far this month, overall exports to East Asia are running strong, which could mean higher deliveries to the country in the coming weeks.
1117 2018-09-20 21:42:41 Big shout-out to Bulgari Paving, who came out and filled two little potholes in my driveway caused by a guest's car's oil leak, all without charge, even though it wasn't under my warranty.
1118 2018-09-20 21:42:39 Moisturise everyday. (First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream,great for sensitive skin)Exfoliate 2-3x per week. (I use bliss micro magic.)Mederma oil and bio oil mixed together work really well to reduce the appearance of scars.

1120 2018-09-20 21:42:11 Trump doesn't want lower oil prices because Russia (who he has a deal with) wants to make more per barrel to bring up their economy,follow the money and it always leads to Trump. He can't negotiate worth a shit but cheating us is fine
1121 2018-09-20 21:42:11 I’m excited for Kanye’s next album to be about the benefits of CBD oil and how microdosing acid has upped his productivity
1122 2018-09-20 21:42:10 x plus oil diffuser (mas o meu modelo é um antigo)
1123 2018-09-20 21:42:03 Oh geez this was me this morning, 2.5 hours for an oil change 
1124 2018-09-20 21:42:01 Can’t be slick with me , my first name is “Can of Oil” 
1125 2018-09-20 21:42:00 من وين شريتيه Coconut oil
1126 2018-09-20 21:41:59 Just a while back @potus was trumpeting how increased Saudi production would bring down gasoline prices. I guess just more hype from the hippo of hype. Gasoline prices haven’t budged much downward & news is that the Saudis want oil prices at $80/barrel 2 help Sidley finances
1127 2018-09-20 21:41:48 No oil or even butter to stop the meat from sticking? Not even marinated? They’re really trying to rob people
1128 2018-09-20 21:41:39 Interference in Hydro One? Weren't you just saying something about privatization? That's a Wynne problem. Our economy is tied to our primary trading partner, the U.S. and the Liberals are trying to sabotage that by fumbling NAFTA. Oil blockades and air taxes don't help either.

1130 2018-09-20 21:41:30 None after my hair is pressed but I use BioSilk & the OGX keratin oil.
1131 2018-09-20 21:41:15 I’m in trouble again from the Boss (wife). Only had one thing to do top up her oil. How hard can it be right? Over filled it by 4 litre, BMW Dealer now having to drain the engine and every mechanic walking past and looking at me as if I robbed a bank. I’ll stick to finace.
1132 2018-09-20 21:41:05 Oh and swapping oil for butter.
1133 2018-09-20 21:41:02 Ah I see! As someone who also loves soft food, if I want pasta to be a little softer I put a small amount of butter and olive oil in the cooked pasta, it makes it taste v good and is also how Italian people do it
1134 2018-09-20 21:41:01 NO I DONT REFUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH WOMEN I REFUSE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH YOU!!!  YOUR NOT A WOMAN YOUR AN OVER-OPINIONATED SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!!!
1135 2018-09-20 21:40:54 Kinda like an oil slick stands behind a damaged tanker.
1136 2018-09-20 21:40:41 both turn black when covered in oil?

1141 2018-09-20 21:40:22 I guess the people of Palestine doesn’t count.. you just cut all aid and left the U.N. board used to protect them from getting slaughtered trying to push them into submission.. nice protection but I figure they have no oil so their useless to you..
1142 2018-09-20 21:40:19 I Tell yeah if i ever decide to host the late late show i will rub coconut oil in my beard my way off giving back to the bored housewives of Ireland #eire
1143 2018-09-20 21:40:19 I watch this lady on YT named Conjure Queen and she said to wipe the outside of the candle in some form of oil before you light to charge it

1146 2018-09-20 21:40:04 Here’s my bi-annual “I hate being an adult and bringing my car to get an oil change” tweet 
1147 2018-09-20 21:40:01 / gahhh that’s awful. one time they stripped the plug in my oil tank and didn’t say anything, all the oil fell out literally the next morning when it cooled off
1148 2018-09-20 21:40:01 I need a hot bath with peppermint oil & lavender infused bath salts........good thing I have it made for me already
1149 2018-09-20 21:40:00 every day The Donald tries to formulate a clear sentence, Paul Ryan silently assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
1150 2018-09-20 21:39:28 Bro she just changed her oil this week lmao after like months, it was probably burnt and shit 
1151 2018-09-20 21:39:25 Sure but in the case of Venezuelan Oil it’s refined by state owned Refineries.... in Texas.
1152 2018-09-20 21:38:57 Shout out to tee tree oil
1153 2018-09-20 21:38:56 Makes me think of being under a car making oil changes.. But, hey, do what makes you happy!

1159 2018-09-20 21:38:34 I wonder what sort of world we would be living in if the FBI hadn’t stolen Nikola Tesla’s inventions.
Clean, free energy that would have ended the need for oil and gas

1161 2018-09-20 21:38:22 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part lemon juice and 1 part almond butter. Add chili peppers and brown sugar to taste.
1162 2018-09-20 21:38:18 Exactly they make it out like it’s impossible , the just want the cheap oil from Saudi
1163 2018-09-20 21:38:08 We use Schaeffer oil products in our super late model it works
1164 2018-09-20 21:37:23 @econ200_ua #Pollution because the US uses 25% of the world’s resources (coal and oil) and 27% gas then we should probably be around 40% pollution to cut down what is currently happening.

1168 2018-09-20 21:36:47 Does BLM opening up another 4 million acres to private oil companies count as the “people’s work”?   I hate what this administration is doing to our beautiful country.
1169 2018-09-20 21:36:42 Coconut & vanilla hair oil 
1170 2018-09-20 21:36:33 It's a blessing AutoZone was closed. 
Now I can't buy oil for my car..... It's out of oil. Ughhhhhhhhhh
1171 2018-09-20 21:36:31 Girl I think everyone’s oil life is 0% i feel you
1172 2018-09-20 21:36:28 the quest for a national airline can be said to be akin to the search for crude oil in the lake Chad basin...... an avenue for very venal politicians to practice their trade of stealing and deceit. #NigeriaAir
1173 2018-09-20 21:36:26 "Keep the library open with just fifteen bottles of olive oil, a pocket calculator and a barbed-wire fence? You're crazy."
1174 2018-09-20 21:36:24 I don’t care if my car is on fire just change the oil I don’t want none of that extra stuff
1175 2018-09-20 21:36:20 Though the downside is oil takes a bit to kick in
1176 2018-09-20 21:36:15 Could be that Pal Al is on the other side (where his bread is already dipped in olive oil).
1177 2018-09-20 21:36:06 You're a fantasist. You only have 10 followers Better than many of mine though, who seem to be snake oil salesmen and porn stars.

1180 2018-09-20 21:35:41 I really just drive my car for months and then casually check the oil percentage like “hmm it’s been a while” 
1181 2018-09-20 21:35:41 I prefer cbd oil for migraines
1182 2018-09-20 21:35:40 My lips are so chapped and I would really like to get that lip oil before they start cracking!!! Lip balm isn't working anymore and my mom went to go see her bf instead of taking me to the store so I can buy myself the lip oil
1183 2018-09-20 21:35:29 Check your oil too 
1184 2018-09-20 21:35:13 $1384 (with an oil change) and it's also leaking coolant so they are testing that. Fml.
1185 2018-09-20 21:35:10 I’m certainly going to leave any food items with palm oil on the store shelves.
1186 2018-09-20 21:35:09 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this September? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
1187 2018-09-20 21:35:08 What’s the best Eczema cream or oil?
1188 2018-09-20 21:34:52 Guille', u skew & leave out plenty. Production costs: Vz imports perishables as meds & some food. These depend on oil, but its price was falling! Also gov debt or bonds were affected by sanctions,which reduce money supply. If anything Vz should have seen a recession or deflation.
1189 2018-09-20 21:34:45 @realDonaldTrump  Now you want to go after OPEC. Dumb If they push back what then? WE need them as well as they need us. Even if you drill for oil in all 50 states we could still be screwwd in the end. Stand up against Big Oil the worse thing would be you could lose their money .
1190 2018-09-20 21:34:30 Are you drilling for oil? Selling out to the Chinese too?

1193 2018-09-20 21:34:23 All the money wasted on wild cat oil exploration on the Chad Basin would have been used to Channel the Niger overflows into recharging Lake Chad.
1194 2018-09-20 21:34:21 Rose oil / anointed rose oil
1195 2018-09-20 21:34:20 I go a little further than that. No engine runs on air! My dad served on the USS Damato (DD-871)
2 shaft; General Electric steam turbines; 4 boilers; 60,000 shp. Likely heavy oil and A LOT OF IT. Somebody pays for it! What's the blood of our finest worth?
1196 2018-09-20 21:34:15 I've got a tooth abscess now! Cotton ball soaked in clove oil work?
1197 2018-09-20 21:34:13 Pump that oil as fast as you can, got to turn it into money right away! For whom though? From a money perspective very few people truly benefit from the production and sale of oil. #cdnpoli
1198 2018-09-20 21:34:04 I’m cool on the “knock out punch”, the “panty dropper”, or the “panty snatcher” oil.
1199 2018-09-20 21:33:57 Submarines!!! In an oil tanker!!!!!
1200 2018-09-20 21:33:40 Bruh your car tells you when to get an oil change... Don't need the internet for that
1201 2018-09-20 21:33:39 Except the pumps can be turned off and oil can be stored. A cow doesnt have a tap that can be turned off nor can milk be stored for more than 2 days. Imagine if the pumps all had to continue, all costs needed to be paid, and oil needed to be dumped instead of sold.
1202 2018-09-20 21:33:31 We need to focus on renewable energy sources and depend less on oil from the Middle East.
1203 2018-09-20 21:32:59 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
1204 2018-09-20 21:32:50 Okay i just saw this lady pour Coca Cola in car...like under the hood where oil should go. What that do?!
1205 2018-09-20 21:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
1206 2018-09-20 21:32:13 if I don’t get my married I will literally never change my oil or get my car checked, life is hard
1207 2018-09-20 21:32:13 EOR makes green oil & can drive economic CO2 reductions in transport as gas has for power. 

Very much agree less emissions = better.. but the 2 deg budget is an aspirational policy goal, not a scientific threshold. Should not hamstring commonsense cleantech.
1208 2018-09-20 21:32:10 If you did do your homework why are you changing your mind? Since 1970s Scotland has produced more oil than Dubai and Kuwait PUT TOGETHER!! We have food banks in every town. Every UK nuclear weapon is in Scotland. 40 miles away from our biggest city. Now we are leaving EU. 
1209 2018-09-20 21:32:05 Sir request to also other gulf countries, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait etc.. that Join CPEC, Invest in Dams of Pakistan, Invest in Pakistan Oil Industry, we have lot oil more than Kuwait or Bahrain.
1210 2018-09-20 21:31:56 Why do we have to buy oil from OPEC? Can't we produce our own?
1211 2018-09-20 21:31:49 I go little by little at a time. I was a basic piercing and went up to a 10 gage after it healed up. Used lube to help it expand. Let it heal up then went to a 6. Did the same thing until I was at a 0. Tapers I heard are good and tree oil helps too.
1212 2018-09-20 21:31:42 Oh kanti, inyongo. Castor oil ksasa
1213 2018-09-20 21:31:29 So…you want to spend billions of dollars in subsidies for a low-margin exercise and ensure that Alberta is forced to take a $10/barrel discount on their oil in order to displace Saudi oil?

1217 2018-09-20 21:31:04 The government of Liberia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Jenna Dewan in a longcloth wig.

1221 2018-09-20 21:30:38 @BiaMaraBrussels what type of oil are your chips fried in??
1222 2018-09-20 21:30:33 Clean em up brush the grill with some oil and heat er up! If I can get three or four yrs out of burners I’m lucky! But I use my grill a lot in the summer! Beer butt chicken! Peking duck! Wok Stir fry on the side burner! Even do pizza! Barbie pizza is good!

1229 2018-09-20 21:30:06 I need more coconut oil
1230 2018-09-20 21:30:06 We import more oil from Canada than from the Middle East. Don't know how a person can live that long, and be that ignorant.

1236 2018-09-20 21:29:11 sleep in coconut oil once a week... it makes ur hair soooo much softer and then it won’t frizz up from being dry!!!! if your hair is naturally oily then just put the coconut oil on the ends and not ur scalp :) and wash it out in the morning!
1237 2018-09-20 21:28:52 We Brits love watching you cowboys lol,  15 aircraft carrier's sucking up your oil  anyone with half a brain ? Wouldn't complain about the fuel lol : )  maybe save some  fuel with mad dog  McCain off duty ,  good night USA. and you Mr president.
1238 2018-09-20 21:28:51 Ooooo
1239 2018-09-20 21:28:45 You do know you also get oil from Canada... remember the country that you have a trade problem with?
1240 2018-09-20 21:28:45 Russia is suffering from low oil prices. They will push for higher prices to help their ailing economy.
1241 2018-09-20 21:27:56 MIRACLE MARKET;  Stocks at record highs is odd. Historically when  there was a big increase in oil prices, or a big increase in interest rates, or a big decline in China stock market (down almost 20% since 1/1/18), stocks in USA declined.  We have all three.  What happens next?
1242 2018-09-20 21:27:48 The cooks at my school but sooo much oil in the food, like why????
1243 2018-09-20 21:27:42 "Faith is the oil that takes the friction out of living"
1244 2018-09-20 21:27:39 I don't know how it's possible for dishes that were washed to feels so dirty, but that's what happened. It really feels like there's oil on all of these...
1245 2018-09-20 21:27:38 Ask yourself this.... Why do you protect? Deep down inside there are always reasons? Maybe due to oil. If you don't like the cost you spend on foreign oil, get it elsewhere... hmm Canada!
1246 2018-09-20 21:27:36 Oil is a completely different commodity and the economics and supply/demand chain works completely differently.

1249 2018-09-20 21:27:24 Also, that one's pretty base level, right above "put gas in the tank." I don't need to know how to change the oil myself. I can park the car at Wal-Mart and shop for 30 minutes.
1250 2018-09-20 21:27:15 On this oil with bruh #1632
1251 2018-09-20 21:27:08 I suspect that's why you may have skin cancer. Olive oil is no protection now is it #24hrsae
1252 2018-09-20 21:27:03 My FUCKING oil cartridge isn't hiring so now i gotta,,,, put clothes on and drive back to the disposal during rush hour
1253 2018-09-20 21:26:56 There’s been 10 huge spiders in this place and I’ve only been here 2 days  i spray the entire place with white vinegar and peppermint oil and there was still another big spider.. I don’t wanna be here
1254 2018-09-20 21:26:37 Benson and Jones probably could have gotten a longer look in a normal preseason but good to see the Oil finally not rushing young guys up to the big club.
1255 2018-09-20 21:26:35 Don't let this Wizkid nonsense distract you from the fact that Morata is a useless slay mama who needs TB Joshua's anointing oil
1256 2018-09-20 21:26:33 he be putting castor oil on his roots there's not way
1257 2018-09-20 21:26:26 I guess we'll have to be smart and refine our own damn oil
1258 2018-09-20 21:26:14 my mom just sent me a link to a custom oil painting website bc she wanted me to see if I liked the work enough for her to commission a painting of my dog.
1259 2018-09-20 21:26:08 That’s from the Fraser institute. What do you think they’d say? They’re bank rolled by big oil. There is too much misleading and deceptive crap in this article I don’t where to start. If you choose to believe this crap, go ahead. I’m just trying to out these guys for your benefit
1260 2018-09-20 21:25:58 Been using elemis skincare for years and I’ve only just discovered how amazing facial oils are?!?! How!!!! I’ve missed out on years of facial oil 
1261 2018-09-20 21:25:46 A few drops of hashish oil on the right spots and that's how the B-52s found their Rock Lobster !

1265 2018-09-20 21:25:32 The New York Yankees are Freemason clones conducting a hyper-sigil!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Santa Claus is just Jesus in a colorful costume!
1266 2018-09-20 21:25:30 protect who exactly the Iraqis, the Syrians if any still live there , the lybians, the Yemenis, the Palestinians ,Sudanese  or the Egyptians, you have sent all these countries to war! and u just milked Saudia Arabia for your infrastructure what more so you want our oil for free!
1267 2018-09-20 21:25:20 Dude, #Turkey and #USA will stay in Syria for a long time. SAA has no military power to oppose them, #Russia lacks political power to make a pressure. Assad got 60% of ruined country with no oil/gas, under constant threat of #Israel air force and American tomahawks.
1268 2018-09-20 21:25:15 I was told today the auto shop legally couldn’t pull my car in to give an oil change because I “don’t have brakes.”  Excuse me, but I’m still stopping and haven’t died. Is my standard of life just really that low?

IF this were to happen it couldn't be one sided to be fair.
1271 2018-09-20 21:24:43 Fuck pills we on that CBD oil wave.
1272 2018-09-20 21:24:38 What is the proof that it was honey/oilive oil in the glasses? Looks a simple meeting with some journos / friends. 
1273 2018-09-20 21:24:22 Have been to north korea. Was on an oil tanker, delivered fuel oil for power station. It was the ships last cargo before being scrapped. Went ashore and the people verty friendly!

1282 2018-09-20 21:23:06 you feel like you're still looking flaky throughout the day. Your skin is dry so you need to maintain the moisture throughout the day. If your using foam cleansers I would suggest looking into cleansing oil and cleansing balms so your skin isnt as dry when you remove your makeup
1283 2018-09-20 21:23:03 Why did  rush to sign a MOU with Trinidad U distrust the 'white man' @exxonmobil who know more about offshore drilling than T'dad. There has been no love lost between T'dad & , why would you trust them with your Oil & Gas wealth. I remember them being tricikidadians 
1284 2018-09-20 21:22:42 I’m actually ok with the tough start honestly. We were 2-0 last year and everyone telling Oakland how great they were and we leaked oil the rest of the way. So I’m not panicking... yet

1287 2018-09-20 21:22:27 Oh my another trek down the rabbit hole. You can stop importing it but your buddies are making billions selling our oil to other countries. Another smoke screen.
1288 2018-09-20 21:22:05 Said this Weald will be my final investment. Been out several times before the red spiral. Don't recollect tipping : there are numerous rampers. Today numerous buys but price set in concrete. Is it the bottom? Crane, plugs, pipe ... weekend oil? Your guess is as good as mine.
1289 2018-09-20 21:22:00 Certainly all oil supplying countries, other than Canada , work on better economy for their people. Just not to encourage John Horgan’s so call greens to take stage.
1290 2018-09-20 21:21:53 Olive oil!
1291 2018-09-20 21:21:53 Plus baby oil on them joints too.
1292 2018-09-20 21:21:52 Anoint me with the oil of the New Testament prophet. Help me to remember that I am a prophet - not a promoter, not a religious manager. Let me never become a slave to crowds. Heal my soul of carnal ambitions and deliver me from the itch for publicity.

1294 2018-09-20 21:21:16 Don the Con calling for lower gas prices. No mention of independence from oil to other sources. Oh, and there is no global warming. Great huh?
1295 2018-09-20 21:21:14 ETP owns the pipeline that blew up oil n Beaver Cty after only being in service for 7 days.
1296 2018-09-20 21:21:11 New medical database for Prime Meridian healthcare providers which includes essential oil information.
1297 2018-09-20 21:21:10 okay that makes me feel better about not getting one yet lol but I’ve only had to wait like 30 mins tops for my oil change
1298 2018-09-20 21:21:09 My formula for success is rise early, work late, and strike oil.

1299 2018-09-20 21:21:09 Mr. President, if the Arabs do not lower oil prices, it does not matter, in my country there is, you ask the illegitimate President Maduro, you are so afraid that he will give it to you as a gift
1300 2018-09-20 21:21:08 Once ya know, ya know. I left makin oil for edibles just to come back to dab land.
1301 2018-09-20 21:20:47 just look at industrial production there was an industrial recession in 2015-2016 partly caused by the oil collapse.  it didn't filter through economy wide, but I think its fair to say that sector was in recession
1302 2018-09-20 21:20:42 I just recently realized how much of a reaction I got from palm oil. I ate some cookies with palm oil and I was really sick until nature took its sweet old time. From now on palm oil is a no go for me.
1303 2018-09-20 21:20:20 Bathing in virgin oil
1304 2018-09-20 21:20:13 Winners sell olive oil, plus everything I was a chorister in Canaanland for 3 years, a WSF leader, a youth leader + LCC Wofbi. However, I agree there are big inaccuracies in the report.
1305 2018-09-20 21:20:04 which is why people are pushing fracking....US was world's largest Oil Producer last year.....OPEC actually banks on US Shale Oil Production to make up for interruptions.
1306 2018-09-20 21:20:02 Iceland have committed to no palm oil in their own products.Also phasing out plastic.Other companies need to follow.
1307 2018-09-20 21:19:55 You know how your car tells you when you should get your oil changed soon, and then tells you again when you need it actually changed is there like a 3rd “this shit is getting urgent” message or is it more of a guess and go type thing? Asking for a friend
1308 2018-09-20 21:19:45 I totally understand how you feel, girl! I haven't tried the CBD oil, I just smoke the medicinal marijuana. It really does work wonders. I've never been to Kentucky but I'd love to visit!
1309 2018-09-20 21:19:41 Oh, one more thing, based on my experience working with guys in foundries, on oil rigs, construction, etc. using highly technical or severe injury terms can cause alarm and then quick indifference because many issues are chronic in nature.
1310 2018-09-20 21:19:36 Location please
1311 2018-09-20 21:19:29 And so Putin gets his much needed increase in oil prices

1321 2018-09-20 21:18:56 S&P at all time high. Medical insurance at all time high, stock buybacks? On fire. Grocery prices  have never been this high. Yes, Bubba, the wealthy (especially your cronies in oil and health care) are doing QUITE well. The rest of us? Nah.
1322 2018-09-20 21:18:55 I hate those to snake oil salesmen shills. They’re a disgrace.
1323 2018-09-20 21:18:44 Next money I get is going to beard oil. I'm fed up.

1327 2018-09-20 21:18:00 (Continued)  Embarrassed, the boy says nothing, so the man sends him back. 
The second time he returns, the oil isn’t on the spoon but explored everything. 
The moral of the story was to explore all the marvels of the world, without forgetting about the oil on the spoon.
1328 2018-09-20 21:17:55 @jkenney today I listened to Premier Ford talk about how we he has the backs of the auto industry, farmers and steel/Alu in the NAFTA battle. Who is backing oil and gas? Or is 18.3% of gdp is not worth standing up for..

1333 2018-09-20 21:17:06 Dude...mono means one. Monopoly means one single seller. OPEC as in Organization of Oil Producing Countries. Count them 16. Not a monopoly....They’re (not there) an oligopoly or more accurately a cartel. You’re (not your) welcome.
1334 2018-09-20 21:17:05 (Continued) When the boy meets the wise man, he tells the boy to go and explore the palace and gave him a spoon of oil. The man told him to not spill the oil, and return in two hours. The boy returned, and the wise man asked him what the boy had seen.

1338 2018-09-20 21:16:33 Simple solution. Legalize Industrial Hemp. Plastics made from hemp oil biodegrade into soil enriching nitrogen in about 10 years. Same with tires, vinyl, and rubber.
1339 2018-09-20 21:16:30 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1340 2018-09-20 21:16:23 It's supply and demand: "OPEC currently has just enough oil to meet global demands without Iran’s supply. However, the international oil body’s spare supplies are limited and “will not be enough if supply is additionally reduced by outages elsewhere”
1341 2018-09-20 21:16:14 I don’t use any of that!! But I think I’m gonna try out the castor oil and buy a new brush for my eyelashes

1349 2018-09-20 21:14:58 Where is our oil???
1350 2018-09-20 21:14:56 BAILOUT? 
Taxpayers on the hook for mismanagement,  corruption and reckless spending?
Government employees make up between 25% and 30% of the entire workforce.
Is this reasonable?
1351 2018-09-20 21:14:55 I just tried putting oil on my fingers before separating my curls for the first time and LET ME TELL YOU I am never looking back.
1352 2018-09-20 21:14:52 I rather that too. This government give the oil for free to Cuba and the benefits from real customers as the EE UU go to the bank accounts of the Narcos, Terrorists, and Assassins that unfortunately run the government. Meanwhile, people starve to death.
1353 2018-09-20 21:14:38 I don't know how you consume your cannabis, but instead of smoking, try using thc drops under the tongue. When you feel it working, that's your bottom and when you feel you're high from it, that's your top. just put it in a coffeefilter, soak it with olive oil and warm for 12hrs
1354 2018-09-20 21:14:32 Love drenching myself in coconut oil 
1355 2018-09-20 21:14:31 What even is an oil change at this point
1356 2018-09-20 21:14:13 Dust blown away from stockpiles left over after oil sands upgrading is very likely a key source of a cancer-linked pollutant commonly found  in the northern Alberta region, concludes a new peer-reviewed study. Ask the natives in the region dying from the Tar Sands
1357 2018-09-20 21:14:13 Sir تراب , 

Don’t be a woman. You are our salve and we control the oil ya dog.

God is protecting us.
1358 2018-09-20 21:13:56 Weren’t the RUs trying to capture US controlled oil fields?
1359 2018-09-20 21:13:42 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1360 2018-09-20 21:13:38 Buddy don’t even know what the purpose of an oil change is
1361 2018-09-20 21:13:37 Listen, dear one, listen... and get an oil change!

1377 2018-09-20 21:11:59 "I  will continue rejecting your reality and substituting truth." HaHaHaHa! Thanks, I needed that!  It's quite hilarious because attempting to mix anything related to Trump (including the GOP & Trumpers) with the truth is like trying to mix oil & water...each repels the other.
1378 2018-09-20 21:11:59 u need some stress away oil
1379 2018-09-20 21:11:36 It must be nice to be able to have a dad to call up and be like “oh my dishwashers broke” “my oil needs changed” “I gotta fucked up tire” or just mostly anything for that matter. 
1380 2018-09-20 21:11:34 Gold, platinum, tin, plastic, who cares! Pure snake oil to gain market share
1381 2018-09-20 21:11:31 Greek salad made with lots of fresh tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, red onions, kalamata olives, feta cheese, a little olive oil, red wine vinegar and oregano is always a favorite in our home!
1382 2018-09-20 21:11:26 We’re more of a Midnight Oil household
1383 2018-09-20 21:11:15 You know they said that about us, right? That we needed Britain, that we’d never survive without them? Now look at us, and we don’t have North Sea Oil.

1389 2018-09-20 21:10:34 They have now reversed the beef tallow rule as they have now peer review that tallow is better for you than a lot of fats,so we can have a percentage of tallow in our frying oil again, maybe Mickey D fries will start tasting good again
1390 2018-09-20 21:10:28 Wonder why so many in the oil industry feel the NDP hurt, not helped?? Are they all delusional?
1391 2018-09-20 21:10:27 ding ding ding... reimposing sanctions on Iran to raise the oil prices was like a Christmas present to Vlad

1393 2018-09-20 21:10:15 The #USA is the biggest oil producer now, read your energy department report's / go get a life for God sake
1394 2018-09-20 21:10:09 YOU WERE REALLY LIKE “wait i gotta change my oil?”
1395 2018-09-20 21:10:06 Okay you’re scaring me, my wallet cannot handle a catastrophic damage. Oil change it is 
1396 2018-09-20 21:10:05 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
1397 2018-09-20 21:10:03 jkenney: RT jkenney: Fascinating visit to the world’s largest oil refinery at Reliance’s enormous plant in Jamnagar, Gujarat. They process nearly 2…
1398 2018-09-20 21:10:02 The USA converted much coal power to Nat gas. Also the US relies on Canada  for about 15% to 20%  of their crude oil feedstock but face no GHG accounting for it. Other countries produce for USA too but only our gov't would punish our O+G industry cuz we feed USA refineries
1399 2018-09-20 21:09:55 It’s easy to say you’re Loyal when y’all never been thru no term oil with a person
1400 2018-09-20 21:09:53 Just got an essential oil massage and I’m a little sweaty so I imagine this is what Coachella smells like
1401 2018-09-20 21:09:49 Former professional biometric data collector here (for one summer): try rubbing your finger on your neck first to collect oil from your skin there. Worked for the visa applicants I collected finger prints from!
1402 2018-09-20 21:09:48 imagine if i died from eating oil paint
1403 2018-09-20 21:09:46 Getting my oil changed and they said pop the hood & I popped the trunk. That tells you how often I look under my hood 
1404 2018-09-20 21:09:43 WOW @Walmart ...been sitting the the sun waiting for help about an oil change...2 girls pull up and get help immediately....never had a problem here before but now going elsewhere
1405 2018-09-20 21:09:35 Hi, hope you're all well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you.  When can I be at your service?
1406 2018-09-20 21:09:33 I ate the CRAP outta some turmeric, I mean I used powder, organic, added all the right crap, mixed it with the magical coconut oil, made golden milk, even got fresh and grated it.

It did nada for my pain but it fired up my gastric situation so imodium became my life.
1407 2018-09-20 21:09:23 Yeah but it still needs an oil change 
1408 2018-09-20 21:09:14 I once checked my old coworkers oil level because her engine was knocking and idling rough. She had no oil at all, I asked her when she maintenanced her car last, she said she never did. She drove it for a whole year like that...  smh
1409 2018-09-20 21:09:02 I go both. Oil, comb out, then balm
1410 2018-09-20 21:09:01 Got my oil think I will try tonight.... see what happens
1411 2018-09-20 21:08:51 How do I become Michael B. Jordan’s baby oil lady
1412 2018-09-20 21:08:47 Sitting in Scranton for three hours until my class because of an oil change. Man this parallels too closely to undergrad. Yikes.
1413 2018-09-20 21:08:45 And we all have oil rigs in our backyards too
1414 2018-09-20 21:08:32 To Trump's not your business intervention in oil prices in the middle East and we don't  need you to the security because we know of mess around security Arab and the world and you are one of them do not exceed the limits
1415 2018-09-20 21:08:28 castro oil sounds like its for a car lol castor oil  don’t intake nothing .... just sit your but down the bun ain’t ready 
1416 2018-09-20 21:08:24 If it makes you feel any better, I skipped out on 3 oil changes cause I didn’t know what to do. Surprisingly my car didn’t blow up 
1417 2018-09-20 21:08:17 Have we aborted the value addition program why export seeds not oil which is of a better value.
1418 2018-09-20 21:08:09 Yeah, people said that about Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq etc.
Your armies still went there.
And here you are, still trying to deny the rest of the world their right to free speech, in the name of cheap oil.
1419 2018-09-20 21:07:24 Oil spills

1421 2018-09-20 21:07:02 My bad, forgot that 

Clothespeg on the nose or liberal sprinkling of a strong essential oil that you tolerate are all I can think of.
Thoughts & prayers, etc... 
Good luck, that gonna be one huge car-scrubbing Saturday cleanup 
1422 2018-09-20 21:07:01 I keep hearing both sides of the coin.
It's the lone flick i have yet to see.
This morning I went to Walmart with my buddy for his oil change (took forever) & hes not a big movie guy, but loves Terminator, (had no idea Salvation exists) He liked Genisys tho.
I'll prob watch 2nit
1423 2018-09-20 21:06:57 You know how to handle them Mr. President. Let them eat that oil or charge them for protection. Every time they increase the oil prices, we increase our defense charges.
1424 2018-09-20 21:06:45 Yup. So is zardari. U didnt know that? Btw i doubt if they are even muslims. No offence. My personal view. Zardari having honey nd olive oil during jalsa. Billo rani not able to speak urdu nd all of thm brought up in uk. God bless nd save sindh.
1425 2018-09-20 21:06:30 If you were a democrat and not a snake oil salesman you would have nothing to fear from a @peoplesvote_uk
1426 2018-09-20 21:06:27 before anything, remove and punish the high ranking officials...

1428 2018-09-20 21:05:51 I think Oil City Confidential should be higher.
1429 2018-09-20 21:05:49 oil change? never heard of her.
1430 2018-09-20 21:05:48 Should have gone for the Type R !!
Mk 2 CRV 2.2 oil burner still seems faster!!
1431 2018-09-20 21:05:46 WWE has a trillion ppv’s in the next 6 weeks. No clue they going back to Saudi Arab. That oil money bag too big to turn down
1432 2018-09-20 21:05:43 It always smells like fucking patchouli oil in the old part of the hotel & I absolutely DESPISE patchouli oil.
1433 2018-09-20 21:05:41 Jumping jacks, evening primrose oil, membrane sweep.
1434 2018-09-20 21:05:39 Palm oil !!!
1435 2018-09-20 21:05:27 had a massage using eucalyptus oil so now i know what it feels like to have full body vapour rub
1436 2018-09-20 21:05:13 Annoiting your house with oil as well as your bed is a good idea and pray heavily the next 3 days you may also try fasting, binding and loosen in Jesus name.
1437 2018-09-20 21:05:02 Somebody kill me.... there’s like oil or some shit all over my nike windbreaker.... these stains better come tf out
1438 2018-09-20 21:04:55 My bed smells of tea tree oil.
I smell like tea tree oil
I hope this is worth it..
1439 2018-09-20 21:04:52 ok. So whose responsibility is it to clean the administration??? fact is modi ji has TOTALLY FAILED in cleaning/destroying congress network. and he will now pay for it.

1440 2018-09-20 21:04:52 i started having an allergic reaction to the oil in the t i was taking so i have to get a new perscription to a t with another oil that’s harder to find 
1441 2018-09-20 21:04:47 Drenched my body in lemongrass oil.
Mum & sis are gagging.
I could care LESS.
Satan's winged spawns SHALL NOT PROSPER PON DIS YAH BODY YAH!
1442 2018-09-20 21:04:42 Wax and oil are the same thing. Its just made a different way to get into the cartridges easier.
1443 2018-09-20 21:04:29 Nigeria futhi nikisi, it's supposed to be the powerhouse of Africa with all the oil but nikisi,  it doesn't have even an airline. Africa could be self-sufficient in fuel.
1444 2018-09-20 21:04:19 Boatloads? 80,000/bbl a day. Peanuts. A fraction of the total daily oil imports for Canada. We're not dependent on their oil, and we don't need it. Fernie's wrong again.
1445 2018-09-20 21:04:16 Would it be possible to send us an image attributed to her? We would like to have her photo and a sample of her work to display. Did you know she was also a marvelous portrait painter? Her husband and our major donor are immortalized in oil, which she did here at the Dyer.
1446 2018-09-20 21:04:01 It's abt the Russia sanctions n the now scuttled ExxonMobil/Rosneft deal 2 develop Russian oil reserves. He doesn't hv 2 be informed just greedy n compromised.
1447 2018-09-20 21:03:54 A yes Indy Ref result would have bankrupted Scotland. When you base your financials on $110brl for North Sea oil then the person should not be putting forward the business case. Reckless feasibility work. If we think divorcing the EU is difficult Scotland would be a bloodbath.
1448 2018-09-20 21:03:51 You need to change your oil.
1449 2018-09-20 21:03:46 The Bay Area's Richmond in Contra Costa County has been polluted with toxic chemicals courtesy of oil companies, one of the worst examples of them subjecting minority populations to horrible pollution.
1450 2018-09-20 21:03:32 I’m 20 now and I’m getting my oil changed
1451 2018-09-20 21:03:31 Why did Emery put oil in at 3-0 up?????? Wud loved to see nketiah getting some minutes

1455 2018-09-20 21:02:52 Banks and Oil here in Canada for starters.  $RY $TD $SU.
1456 2018-09-20 21:02:47 The Oil and Gas industry are only taking in 3rd and 4th year apprentices... Won't pay for the first 2 
1457 2018-09-20 21:02:19 I have to pay to get my car fixed and get an oil change and fix my hair and more so my paycheck is going to immediately disappear
1458 2018-09-20 21:02:14 I use cbd oil for my ibs. I find it helps immensely with the pain when nothing else does.
1459 2018-09-20 21:02:13 It still managed to run even though I was acting like my hair was plutonium!!! Some of the bits are light brown now ffs I didn’t put castor oil on top!
1460 2018-09-20 21:02:09 Oligarchy, like when the GOP flows all the taxpayer dollars into huge private businesses and the businesses give a good portion back to the GOP in unlimited campaign contributions. Education, oil, private prisons, military contracts, 12,000 kids locked up at $800/day.
1461 2018-09-20 21:02:04 3/5 

Over 30 masterclasses on essential oil blending and mind body spirit medicine....all free to attend.
1462 2018-09-20 21:01:48 1. Venezuela's oil fields were nationalized under Chavez IIRC, so that industry in particular was definitely socialist.

2. US is both capitalist and socialist. Private capital exists, corporatism, as do public programs, and safety nets. 

3. Depends on the Country's resources.
1463 2018-09-20 21:01:46 Hi, I hope you're well. I run a successful business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you. When would you like my service? Thank you

1468 2018-09-20 21:01:26 Well I don't know how it happened, but the oil cap in Betty Lou broke apart when I tried to refill her oil. I can't get it off. Hopefully I can pry it apart with some pliers, but dude.... this never happened to me before. XD
1469 2018-09-20 21:01:20 Get the price of oil down and tax the gas !
We would pay the same .   Pay off the dept !
1470 2018-09-20 21:01:20 If Putin and Trump do get close, that's the world's largest oil reserves  meets the world's largest economy. Guess they'll need the world's biggest financial market too. Especially banking.
1471 2018-09-20 21:01:17 I guess that I hurt your feelings ... Who's Wizkid btw? If you didn't care bout being noticed you wouldn't be here trying to pick on someone else.. Pot kettle? Gosh! I don't care bout him being in your life or not, just don't come here with the oil and gas crap.. Now move along
1472 2018-09-20 21:01:16 Na i support I Barca and my manager . Not some oil money asslicker

1475 2018-09-20 21:00:53 About those oil prices Wally...
1476 2018-09-20 21:00:35 For me or the humans? BOL  I'll get them to look into it, thank you.
It's pretty annoying, TFH is playing quiet bangs and pops on a desensitisation recording and there are plans afoot for a distraction toy so calming oil is a good idea to add.
1477 2018-09-20 21:00:35 I put a Lush body conditioner AND castor oil on it and I washed each section separate and it still leaked a bit!!! Sad some parts of my fringe is light brown now :(

1482 2018-09-20 21:00:26 September 20, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1483 2018-09-20 21:00:22 We can lead in green innovation instead of being stuck to oil  monopolies
1484 2018-09-20 21:00:02 We protect the countries of the Lover's Nuts West, they would not be out for packing fudge whack without us, and yet they give face to cunt lapping for higher and higher oil prices! We shit bucket. The OPEC monopoly must get prices up now!

1486 2018-09-20 20:59:41 As as summer passes to autumn and then to winter the Liberal response to the TMX decision remains absolutely nothing. @RachelNotley imposes no consequence.  Meanwhile @jkenney is working hard to open a new market for AB oil.  Vote accordingly next year.
1487 2018-09-20 20:59:34 Ayy, here soon Coke is gonna try adding cannabis oil and infuse drinks
1488 2018-09-20 20:59:34 As in salt eats d plaster, break d bonds of d concrete like cabin biscuit d blocks turn to sand after a year, zinc rusts, roof gutters too, but we're doing a lot of research on additives to contain d situation
1489 2018-09-20 20:59:31 “how come they have all this oil and cigarettes but they don’t remember what dirt is?”
-derek talking about waterworld
1490 2018-09-20 20:59:29 You know you’re sleep deprived when instead of oil and vinegar you say positive and negative
1491 2018-09-20 20:59:20 I've some how just managed to get tea tree oil in my eyes!!! Now, I know some products say on the bottle, "if product gets it in your eyes, wash with warm water" and I often think how could you manage to get it in your eyes? WELL I JUST DID! 
1492 2018-09-20 20:59:09 @thegoodcrisp touts self as having GOOD Crisps.They're gluten free and free from GMO, is that enough? They are made in Malaysia and have palm oil... so what do you guess, is their chip conflict free? Or does it rely on deforestation and habitat destruction?
1493 2018-09-20 20:59:07 I really like your idea for the electronic motor, every company is just into building new cars to keep the economy and innovation going but we should get into making things more simple and not overuse our resources. It will work with every car? No oil needed? Battery?

1496 2018-09-20 20:58:56 If you aren’t spending your staycation making warm olive oil infused with rosemary for the skillet pizza you’re making for dinner...literally what *are* you doing?
1497 2018-09-20 20:58:49 lmao i forgot to get oil for a couple thousand miles and i had to get a new car 
1498 2018-09-20 20:58:48 So I’m getting an oil change and I get a notification that my Bluetooth just connected so I hope they enjoy my trap music
1499 2018-09-20 20:58:43 this whole castor oil thing better induce me, cause that shit is disgusting
1500 2018-09-20 20:58:37 Whoa! Your first oil painting? This is great.
1501 2018-09-20 20:58:37 If someone can afford car,  I am sure they can bear the oil cost too
1502 2018-09-20 20:58:35 dude my car is telling me i need a new oil filter bruhh i just put a new not that long ago
1503 2018-09-20 20:58:34 Please sir..do your work ..don't let petty issues bother you... now tell us abt economy and oil prices...
1504 2018-09-20 20:58:13 I have extra oil come over lol
1505 2018-09-20 20:58:13 Nothing’s better than a new oil change, clean car, and a full tank 
1506 2018-09-20 20:58:12 Oh yay! I just found my missing cod liver oil capsule wardrobe.
1507 2018-09-20 20:58:05 She's really going to freak out when she sees Baby Oil!
1508 2018-09-20 20:57:56 The disciples gathered in the upper room praying about how to lower their carbon footprint?

Jesus prayed for those who would believe because of their account and one day own oil wells?

Those who know the voice of the father all own hybrid cars?
1509 2018-09-20 20:57:53 Prime Minister, IK, visit to Saudi Arabia and at the same time Chief of Army Staff, General Qamar Bajwa, visit to China now make some sense. Saudi Arabia could be the third strategic partner of CPEC. Gwadar will be the oil city and next economic activities hub.
1510 2018-09-20 20:57:52 We have really awful nats. Other bugs don’t bother him so much. But the nats are killer. I’ve found cedar oil and peppermint oil works well on them. Also I’ve heard tea tree oil is great for ticks and I’ve maybe picked 3 ticks off him in my life. So the oils help!
1511 2018-09-20 20:57:51 So it’s Big Oil’s fault? Nothing to do with you,me, everybody driving flying etc...?
1512 2018-09-20 20:57:48 Smell some eucalyptus oil next time your sinuses are congested. You’re welcome.

1515 2018-09-20 20:57:23 Bring a very small bottle of Chinese hot oil. As soon as they put their foot up, put some of the oil on it.

1519 2018-09-20 20:57:02 The ole mechanic way. A little grease and oil never hurt nothing!
1520 2018-09-20 20:57:01 Salute to my dude changing my oil in flip flops with no socks!
1521 2018-09-20 20:56:59 You could feed me linguini pasta with artichokes and tomatoes lightly tossed in olive oil ( and a few small other things ) and pizza everyday and I’d be content ..
1522 2018-09-20 20:56:48 The fact that I shower after work bc I'm covered in oil, paint or grease just to go to gym an get sweaty.... I just refuse get that shit in my eyes forreal 
1523 2018-09-20 20:56:40 That’s funny cause the fuel prices here have doubled since the day you took office,so I believe there’s a deeper darker problem here,like maybe your traitorous greedy little hands are so deep in big oil???? Especially since you owe who knows how much to your daddy Purim!!
1524 2018-09-20 20:56:25 Rural America (Trump country) was getting pummeled by declines in all sorts of commodity prices, not just oil.

1527 2018-09-20 20:55:59 He decoded well enough. Have you ever thought all these are plans for the north to cart away money for the North.
Like in ‘Buhari loot’

1535 2018-09-20 20:55:40 You protect dictators and tyrants you big orange turd.

The whole of the ME doesn't need your interference. But then again the greed for oil knows no humanity.
1536 2018-09-20 20:55:11 So true. I sometimes use a smashed avocado with olive oil, lime, salt and pepper. Especially good with a Mexican salad.
1537 2018-09-20 20:55:11 Ladies, when’s the last time ya oil light was off?
1538 2018-09-20 20:55:06 @AveryProducts I use avery removable labels in my planner & I could really use .38 or .5 round labels for icons. Can you add to "to consider making" list? They'd be popular with essential oil people too
1539 2018-09-20 20:55:02 Canada very nicely sells you oil at a $20 per barrel discount to world prices....and has that worked out for them?

1543 2018-09-20 20:54:36 Well if it we're up to me i would stop giving protection to the middle east until those oil prices got dropped. Out of curiosity though was else does the USA trade with the middle east can't just be protection for oil?
1544 2018-09-20 20:54:31 If it works I need to find some for my son who has epilepsy and anexiety.  He vapes but I cant find cbd oil. Oh and he has a medical card.  Just cant find it since I live in a state you cant buy it yet he can get a CBS medical card.....

1546 2018-09-20 20:53:57 I bought copper compression gloves for the pain I have in my wrists & hands. It was interesting trying them out last night but I think they will be helpful. I also got some CBD oil rub but it doesn't seem to be as strong as the stuff we had for my dad. #fibromialgia #ChronicPain

Sir plz hire me i can find oil without seismic.
1550 2018-09-20 20:53:28 If you love yourself or your family, don’t eat products with palm oil, the FDA even limits percentage allowed added to food,
1551 2018-09-20 20:53:27 Indonesia? It's an oil importer and China is the second commercial.partner
1552 2018-09-20 20:53:16 It is also why he is destroying EPA, and Parks, huge oil reserves up in Alaska but on Park Lands and hunting grounds. The natives depend on the only caribou run in that area.  Plus I think it is also the last huge herd of caribou not damaged by the oil environment.

1554 2018-09-20 20:52:53 My spouse, who has lupus, had to get away with her walker while I blocked two overenthusiastic women waving vials of lavender essential oil. No verbal protests could deter them.
1555 2018-09-20 20:52:49 this drive thru oil change spot is the one... they hook everything up and you don't gotta get out the car
1556 2018-09-20 20:52:40 @realDonaldTrump The gdp is stalling due to the high price of gasoline. Unemployment is up and gas is $3.00 per gal., this is ludicrous. We're  the #1 oil producer in the world, yet prices are set by OPEC. This is beyond gouging is flat out theft. You need to stop it or regulate.
1557 2018-09-20 20:52:32 I’m allergic to sesame seed but I’ve had sesame seed for many years and never had a reaction. My mom cooked with sesame oil and my throat constricted. Now I have these egg rolls made with sesame seed oil and idk what’s going to happen

1562 2018-09-20 20:51:40 Ooh there are so many lovely options!  What are you loving most about Jason and the Argan Oil?
1563 2018-09-20 20:51:38 It’s interesting, we have our oil coffers filled up and our oil companies are making Billions in profit revenue each year. And yet even when opec brings down prices, we see higher prices at the gas pump. Go figure. Oil companies make bigger profit, consumers pay more. Makes sense
1564 2018-09-20 20:51:37 @GrandHustleBET man OIL KING was funny as hell. By far the craziest episode and Vanessa Blair is so embarrassed she locked her twitter account lol. After watching her would anyone hire her to lead a business? She’s not playing with a full deck

1572 2018-09-20 20:50:38 The way that palm oil is digested by human,not camels is very inefficient, it has a low mo.ecular at, thereby crossing the gut blood barrier at a less digested state, not utilized as calories.
1573 2018-09-20 20:50:32 Lizzo’s “Good as Hell” is such a feel-good song. “Coconut Oil” is such a pick-yourself-back-up anthem.
1574 2018-09-20 20:50:15 @cheezit Is the palm oil in Cheez-It crackers sustainable? Can you assure me that you get your palm oil from sources that don't exploit people or harm the habitats of gibbons, orangutans, etc?

1587 2018-09-20 20:48:52 Tens of thousands of Texas oil & gas jobs (full disclosure - including mine) depend on oil prices staying at there current levels - vote BETO !

1602 2018-09-20 20:47:25 As for the Venezuelan crisis, that's down to a combination of the fall in world oil prices, the variable exchange rate introduced by Chavez in 2003, which has been a boon for black marketeers, and Maduro's counter-productive efforts to address the crisis through devaluation.
1603 2018-09-20 20:47:15 Since you are in Athens I highly recommend buying different types of oils. Like olive oil and balsamic. O and you don't want to miss out on the Gyros and the Olives. Have Fun !!!!!!!!!!!!

1645 2018-09-20 20:42:31 Ummm... this was a gas pipeline right mike? As in not oil, but natural gas. I’m sure you realize that virtually every house in NA has some sort of gas line to it right? 

You’re narrative equating this to oil pipelines is pathetic, even for you!

1648 2018-09-20 20:42:12 I see the leader of the official opposition has been in India promoting investment by HUGE multinational oil field service companies in Alberta.  Will they compete fairly with Alberta companies?  Are we cutting our own throats?  I bet they can do infrastructure cheaper too.
1649 2018-09-20 20:42:10 It's British oil, not Scottish.

1653 2018-09-20 20:41:57 Analogy: socialist Venezuela trades oil with capitalist (arguably) US. Quite symbiotic.

So, according to you:
1. Is Venezuela capitalist now?
2. Is the US socialist?
3. Do you need two countries for capitalism to work?

These questions are stupid due to definition fallacies.
1654 2018-09-20 20:41:39 Sounds like a huckster at a carnival selling snake oil.
1655 2018-09-20 20:41:37 Rich knows better. He'd come back from Alaska to find his car painted salmon, with 80 quarts of motor oil in the crankcase and Obama and hillary bumper stickers plastered all over it.  #zeoliarmy

1666 2018-09-20 20:40:42 How to say Mr. President throw more oil on the market then the prices go down,it will give more jobs and increase prosperity your citizen.
1667 2018-09-20 20:40:36 the way pricks are going missing in lagos guys you need to wash your head with anointing oil before leaving your house
1668 2018-09-20 20:40:35 I just heard from your administration that WE LEAD in the production of oil.  If that is true, distribute the oil to us!  Don’t purchase oil from other countries.  Your so MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, then why not ask people to buy local, even in oil.
Ailing, failing DT.

1675 2018-09-20 20:39:38 He used to be a member of PVV  party but islamists simply bought him over with oil money.
He will sell even his own mother if the offer is right and will include his children to sweeten the deal.
Human garbage that is what he is.....
1676 2018-09-20 20:39:28 Is better you cut yourself off the hand instead if being the finger that will the pick oil that will soil the other fingers. Goodnight
1677 2018-09-20 20:39:22 Absolutely. But just as governments can allow runaway wage inflation, as happened here in the 90s-early 2000s oil boom, not getting Albertan companies at least in the bidding process can also instigate wage inflation from multinationals who can afford to pay less.

1679 2018-09-20 20:38:57 Pasta bake, stir fry vegetables (perhaps with tofu), and subji (just add olive oil, tomato puree, spices, veggies, maybe some water cook down) are a few options.

1683 2018-09-20 20:38:28 Palm oil is derived from what exactly?
Tree palms?
Because the only other iteration in my mind is a hand.
That is just my crazy maker thinking.
So, I am assuming it is a palm of some type.
I just have no idea which kinda palm.
1684 2018-09-20 20:38:22 They are darn fine that way. Cut them in half lengthwise, toss them with balsamic and olive oil and salt and pepper, and roast. Can't remember what temp, but I think it's fairly high. They are the yum.
1685 2018-09-20 20:38:09 Drama queen! Fry in garlic oil, tasty!
1686 2018-09-20 20:38:07 Exactly. 10 billion isnt just being transferred but infact is going to be a part of saudi stake in the country where it is going to build an oil city. So this changes a lot.

1701 2018-09-20 20:35:52 What should they do? Import more crude oil? No, thats not an option.
1702 2018-09-20 20:35:50 I did the same thing today! At the local "health grocery" there were all kinds of Caesar dressings, many of them organic etc.  Only 1 I could find is avocado oil based, and its not even the Caesar I wanted.  Ridiculous.
1703 2018-09-20 20:35:42 Hi, hope you're well. I run a successful business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy.  This treatment defies science. When would you like me to prove science wrong? Thank you

1711 2018-09-20 20:35:11 Wrong.  Don't mix your politics w/ financial analysis.  I don't.

I want to see society off of oil ASAP & for EVs to proliferate; however, @elonmusk is a fraudster and financial criminal, who has hoodwinked progressive folks to believe he'll deliver us all to that promised land.
1712 2018-09-20 20:35:10 Trump always wants to “Take The Oil” and will do anything to save himself...Its definitely a possibility

1737 2018-09-20 20:33:13 Also, I believe that the curd oil in "our" lands are also the same characteristics as why we use oil in our everyday vehicle engines. To "COOL DOWN" metal friction that is chased by moving parts inside the engine. The oil is to COOL down the engine TEMPERATURE! AS DOES CURD OIL!!
1738 2018-09-20 20:33:08 Even the Federal govt does not work, all they do is sell crude oil they can't even mine and loot all the money so what do you expect from the civil service is it not the head that controls the body... Pathetic

1740 2018-09-20 20:33:07 Same with my car. I’ve just been gone so much I keep forgetting. But my first car I didn’t get an oil change for over a year  pretty sure that’s what screwed it up!
1741 2018-09-20 20:33:05 welll this too i need some like oil base herb type shit
1742 2018-09-20 20:32:58 Palm oil is what exactly?
1743 2018-09-20 20:32:57 Because it has to do with a major Italian Oil company Agip ENI

1747 2018-09-20 20:32:22 Interesting. But if so why isn't there a more or less permanent oil slick in that area?
1748 2018-09-20 20:32:17 Yes, palm oil is nasty stuff..
1749 2018-09-20 20:32:13 Nooo not like 5000 miles over. Like every 5000 miles I get a oil change lol!!! I’m pretty good about them just recently I’ve been ignoring it cause I don’t have time haha
1750 2018-09-20 20:32:05 There are no salad dressings in any regular supermarket not made with “vegetable oil”. Haven’t checked Whole Foods. Huge opportunity for blue cheese dressing based on olive oil or something similar.

1753 2018-09-20 20:31:35 Yes, for me it’s instant heartburn, especially cream fillings and icings, powdered milk in commercial use is a lot like coffeemate, it has palm oil in it, and that along with other additive accelerate atherosclerosis, and dementia
1754 2018-09-20 20:31:27 “cars don’t automatically change its oil” I’ve officially heard it all.
1755 2018-09-20 20:31:24 Holy buckets. I know not all of you are oil junkies like me. But. The new kids line and other new products announced today. Wahoo! #doterraconvention2018

1762 2018-09-20 20:30:45 You know the answer - natural resources (copper, nickel, oil, and natural gas), tax benefit, bilingual workforce at a lower cost, military training, etc. You just can't help but pretend you're the colonizer and not the colonized.
1763 2018-09-20 20:30:43 I used to have this. I have really sensitive skin and severe eczema. This has cured it but I was given it from an Australian. It is called Australian EUCALYPTUS OIL CREAM. It works wonders. I am not sure if you can get it in the UK.

1771 2018-09-20 20:30:10 They just extract the oil and refine it. We burn it. Don't punish then, build light rail and public transportation instead so we don't have to buy it. I'm voting no.

1784 2018-09-20 20:28:39 The US and Israel want Assad out of the way for their pipelines just like the waters in Gaza that are patrolled by their IDF. It’s all a benefit with the rich elite they have a stake in the oil and gas. This is nothing new.
1785 2018-09-20 20:28:27 Sounds like here where they like to put oil pipelines through American Indian lands.

1797 2018-09-20 20:27:18 Ok, the Belgian needs to step in here. Our basic fries are the best. We’ve got special potatoes for fries. We cut them up by hand, wash them, fry them once in 170 degrees oil and the for a second time in 180 degrees. And then mayo. Glorious mayo 
1798 2018-09-20 20:26:38 Looks like he's drinking a bottle of olive oil 
1799 2018-09-20 20:26:32 First the olive oil, now my umbrella is missing. Must be gremlins.
1800 2018-09-20 20:26:08 Don’t support oil. Buy an EV and solar+energy storage for your house if you use coal
1801 2018-09-20 20:26:02  add a few drops of lavender or pomegranate oil
1802 2018-09-20 20:25:51 I really do appreciate when brands make “boosters” for their scents. 

it’s nice to blend an oil base w/ an alcohol base.

especially, with complimentary notes.

The residents of Dutse Zone 6 close to CAC church have not had power for four days now.

I learnt that the transformer needed oil, but to my shock and disappointment the officials are playing bureaucratic tactics with getting the oil for the transformer.

Pls help
1808 2018-09-20 20:25:21 Does a nice job of hiding the fungus though.
1809 2018-09-20 20:25:21 i’d probably recommend beard oil then. i usually recommend balms / wax if the facial hair looks scraggly.

1812 2018-09-20 20:24:49 Better late than never but I will never trust anyone who is happy to be ruled by a foreign government at any time. 45% of the nation did a little bit of research before they placed an X in a box. It is because of people like you that an oil rich nation like Scotland gets raped.
1813 2018-09-20 20:24:48 Same same same. I guess argan oil at your ends is what everyone tells me but it feels kind of icky to just straight up oil it, so I use an argan oil based conditioner in the shower and that seems to be a good level of shiny and moisturized without being greasy through the day.

1838 2018-09-20 20:21:47 I tried to work there as a sardine once but they fired me when they caught me sneaking some oil home in my pocket.
1839 2018-09-20 20:21:42 I have a package lost in the mail but neither the company nor the post office will do anything because it’s status is “in transit” so now I have to buy more fly spray because the package is the essential oil’s I use to make my homemade fly spray. I’m annoyed. 
1840 2018-09-20 20:21:28 Tried bubblewrap, noisy plastic, tinfoil, citrus oil, yelling, reward/punishment (=being held as a baby, until he began to like it). Nothing worked. Now use a spray with built in motionsensor (sscatcat?). That works! Cat jumps up, gets squirted and 'hissed' at, jumps down.
1841 2018-09-20 20:21:21 If you could find a company with Barite .
Barite is hard to come by and all oil drilling rigs needs it.

1845 2018-09-20 20:20:52 you could just do straight broth but i like adding ginger, garlic, red chili flakes, fish sauce, toasted sesame oil, kombu, or whatever else seems good. it's a very quick, easy, and tasty meal that will last you a while.
1846 2018-09-20 20:20:49 I witnessed every oil and gas company leave Shreveport for Houston in the early 60’s. Shreveport tanked and the state took a big hit in tax revenue bc employees and executives left the state. All for a better deal in Texas. That’s why LA is a 3rd world county. Beat the plow mule.

1872 2018-09-20 20:17:29 Hi @greg_ip : it is really underrated as a factor in the 2016 election how wobbly the economy looked at the start of that year. There is a mini recession in manufacturing in 2015-2016, which these folks may be reacting too. Plus the oil/fracking shock feeding through.
1873 2018-09-20 20:17:27 14/ See, it’s one thing if he just closed up shop and quietly retreated after it stopped being lucrative, but he clearly wants it both ways.
He doesn’t want to really carry on with his snake oil cart, but he still wants that caravan entourage to hang on to his every word.

1879 2018-09-20 20:16:51 Ppl have their locked in views and aren't willing to listen to the other side (mostly due to many living in their bubble & dismissing thoughts outside that bubble). We can't discuss a national oil plan that reduces foreign oil due these locked in views.

1881 2018-09-20 20:16:49 It’s understandable, fear causes people to believe snake oil sales pitches and charlatan rhetoric as gospel.  When you’re so afraid, you begin to believe in somethings so much that it’s easy for third parties to twist lies into believable theories.

1895 2018-09-20 20:15:39 Lol I still say bullshit, with oil you need to chart potential upside and downside. And if that was the case you would of seen this going to $71.4x instead of suggesting short between 70.5 and 71. Your also lucky your SL didn't hit or else you would have been fucked

1902 2018-09-20 20:15:10 You really don’t seem to understand how the oil markets work.
1903 2018-09-20 20:15:09 Dehydrated skin is like, it looks tight, might feel tight, with a layer of oil on it, and fine lines that you’re too young to have, or your pores look extra prominent. If you drink a lot of water and don’t use much AHAs or retinoids you prob don’t have dehydrated skin
1904 2018-09-20 20:15:05 I just got a $250 oil change bc neither my dad or Chris were in town to go with me to make sure I didn’t get a $250 oil change

1918 2018-09-20 20:13:50 I need a haircut & oil change so I know how I’m spending my Saturday lol
1919 2018-09-20 20:13:46 Pull out of the middle east. They don't want us there. The only reason we're there is to control those very same oil prices you claim that are overpriced. Bring our boys home
1920 2018-09-20 20:13:43 1 hour for a oil change ?
1921 2018-09-20 20:13:41 Cool.  The oil prices will go down and Mexico will pay for it.  Good plan, Moron.

1923 2018-09-20 20:13:17 I’m so thankful I have a grandfather who at the drop of a hat will change my oil or do whatever else my car needs done
1924 2018-09-20 20:13:03 Smashing it by employing modern day slaves on £2.50 a day? Their economy is v different to ours with vast oil reserves to sell worldwide. What little gas reserves we have are used up mostly within the U.K. It is always going to be the case that the gen public pay bulk of tax bill
1925 2018-09-20 20:13:02 I thought our dependence on foreign oil was a thing of the past, what gives?
1926 2018-09-20 20:12:54 What kind combo is that bread and oil lol

1931 2018-09-20 20:12:24 Stop protecting them. RT @realDonaldTrump: We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
1932 2018-09-20 20:12:18 Y’all do oil too, or at least Derrick did lol
1933 2018-09-20 20:12:18 so opec and everyone else should lose their asses because you say so. Please without a certain price, anyone selling oil can not make money
1934 2018-09-20 20:12:15 Alexa, schedule an oil change with my dealer on Friday at 3... Alexa, play news brief on my way to work...
1935 2018-09-20 20:12:10 Oil has been at the center of our progress for far too long.

US$ index slid. Grains gained from a rise in exports of beans to the EU. Also from rumors, China may lower tariffs.
1939 2018-09-20 20:12:04 My dad asked me to go get him an oil change and pick up a pizza so while I’m waiting I’m drinking beer on his dime honestly I think this is the best idea I’ve had in awhile
1940 2018-09-20 20:12:02 every time i get an oil change and they tell me my car is still healthy i literally jump for joy, blessed to have had the same car for 5 years with her being older 
1941 2018-09-20 20:12:00 Juice lemons.. add 4 cups to a pot and 1 cup white balsamic... reduce until think.. make the most amazing drizzle and will keep in fridge for months.. over ice cream, with olive oil for dressing, on pancakes etc..
1942 2018-09-20 20:11:56 Just in & what great timing with the horrible weather we’re experiencing  

• Oil filled rads from €49
• Oil free rads from €89
1943 2018-09-20 20:11:51 The hot weather won’t stick around much longer. The Marietta Spice Mill has added many more loose leaf teas. Come stock up on them for the cool days ahead. We have also added some new oil and vinegar containers, salt and pepper shakers, and different size spice jars.
1944 2018-09-20 20:11:50 But none of the sleepover stuff was posted on your snapchat. Just paint and oil. Post that up!
1945 2018-09-20 20:11:50 No you shouldn't tbh you're hair will only become weaker or at least use coconut oil and hair masks
1946 2018-09-20 20:11:23 You protect #Israel only. Too bad @Israel has no oil. Ask help to your attack dog- #SaudiArabia!
1947 2018-09-20 20:11:21 IF we treated health care like car car, and only had insurance for the catastrophic 'collisions" and paid for our own oil changes directly with providers, it'd be great, cheap, and efficient.  IE the opposite of Medicare and Obamacare.
1948 2018-09-20 20:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: moist crust with moist motor oil and meat lovers.
1949 2018-09-20 20:11:08 Electricity??? Oh well personally I just use coconut oil
1950 2018-09-20 20:10:59 I wanna buy some lip oil....
1951 2018-09-20 20:10:53 I know. About a dozen years ago I read quite a bit about this looking into the 'peak oil' theory. Now in some places they have to pump in huge amounts of water to push the oil out.
1952 2018-09-20 20:10:50 You are protecting the existence of Israel in the Middle East , that is all what you care about and of course the oil of the Gulf countries, America is the real threat to countries in the Middle East
1953 2018-09-20 20:10:47 3. By adding to the processed oil from Bitter Canola seeds, to make it compatable with aviation grade fuel. Adjusting the low temprature viscosity and properties to make it a real zero or heavily reduced carbon alternative. As opposed to a process that still pollutes!
1954 2018-09-20 20:10:45 HOMEMADE NUTTELLA - put ur nuts in a magic bullet with a drop of coconut oil and cocoa powder dairy free and way better for u!
1955 2018-09-20 20:10:43 Coconut oil is amazing, it’s like lotion that you can eat.
1956 2018-09-20 20:10:42 $40 spa massages with argan oil and clay!!
1957 2018-09-20 20:10:41 Recent Developments:
1. KSA investment in Oil, agriculture, IT and textile sectors. 
2. US considering to resume coalition support fund to Pak.
3. CPEC back on track after COAS' visit of china and Saudi's wish to join the venture.

1958 2018-09-20 20:10:40 So pissed. I was at Beckley west today doing paper work. I left and came back to give her paper and there was a spot with oil on it, it wasn’t mine. But the maintenance guy tried to say it was mine. Long story short I’m not aloud back there tell my car is fixed. I checked my car.
1959 2018-09-20 20:10:37 So this is what you are doing for Halloween then?
1960 2018-09-20 20:10:27 Covered #MilwaukeeCounty Board (@MKECountyBoard) meeting today. Hemp, hemp seeds and cannabinoid oil became topics of conversation as supervisors voted to engage in a study on revenue-generating uses for Mitchell Park Greenhouses. I'll have a piece soon in Milwaukee County Post.
1961 2018-09-20 20:10:22 Midnight Oil - Progress #NowPlaying
1962 2018-09-20 20:10:21 No—sorry but you could try the FAB01 oil I make. It’s not greasy and I use it on my hair. DM your address and I’ll send you a sample 
1963 2018-09-20 20:10:20 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
1964 2018-09-20 20:10:13 I really wish coconut oil lived up to its hype
1965 2018-09-20 20:10:11 Hit the oil tank parking lot 9 miles out, we limited out on Kings in 1 hour #woodys

1968 2018-09-20 20:09:59 I need my car detailed. My fatass just ruined my seats trynna eat bread and oil while I drive 
1969 2018-09-20 20:09:54 In my oil painting class but having a hard time painting bc I’m shaking I’m so HUNGRY
1970 2018-09-20 20:09:51 Nah.
They're fundraising off of it.
1971 2018-09-20 20:09:33 #USA and UK have pretty much have captured SaudiArabia . A farcical “kingdom” #petrodollar vassal of the West. Oil for weapons.
1972 2018-09-20 20:09:32 With all due respect, do you supplement your body with vitamins, minerals and essential oil?  Very important to maintain a healthy body
1973 2018-09-20 20:09:31 ขอบคุณมากเลยนะค้าา 
1974 2018-09-20 20:09:27 I’m addicted to hair oil 
1975 2018-09-20 20:09:26 that's not the half of it... the technology and energy extremes required to extract each barrel oil have been going up every decade.

back in the day 5 barrels of oil could be brought to market for only 1 barrel worth of energy invested

now it takes something like 3 or 4 barrels
1976 2018-09-20 20:09:24 You know how hard it is to stay in shape when all you eat is food with more oil than Saudi
1977 2018-09-20 20:09:17 Neat, Trump still doesn’t control oil & gas prices.
1978 2018-09-20 20:09:17 The waste oil form restaurants and eateries would have to be disposed of safely and could also be converted into high quality alternative diesel. A Zambian once ran such an operation but was not supported by our government. This would change under NAREP.
1979 2018-09-20 20:09:16 А? Есть? Такие? Что? Хотят? Боли? Разочарования? Стыда? И? Страха?

1983 2018-09-20 20:08:59 I don’t know what female needs to hear this but get a oil change
1984 2018-09-20 20:08:45 So welcome, yes we should meet up for some nice food  . Will have a bit more free time in October , let’s be in touch xxx
1985 2018-09-20 20:08:24 The one I tried tasted like extra virgin olive oil with a hint of weed. Not too bad. Never knew it could cause heartburn. Hopefully it won’t give me any. 
1986 2018-09-20 20:08:23 Thanks for the advice! Do you have a particular type or brand of horticultural oil you recommend?
1987 2018-09-20 20:08:13 Gerald's game is... Jesus Christ...... " The thing about blood is before it clots it's slicker than oil"
1988 2018-09-20 20:08:04 OPEC is run by Venezuela. Work toward helping Venezuelans free themselves from dictatorship.  That would definitely be a good move by your administration.  OPEC oil is not just from the Middle East.  $ from oil exports from Venezuela is what funded the rise of a dictator in Venz.
1989 2018-09-20 20:07:58 I've always thot Chia Pet - but press on nails might be more accurate
1990 2018-09-20 20:07:54 I wish there was a permit to pack handgun while bow hunting.  Trappers, surveyors, and oil workers can get them why can’t hunters who hold a valid PAL?
1991 2018-09-20 20:07:39 Lol. Noted. 
1992 2018-09-20 20:07:35 2. from all accounts from what is being presented. Surely the process can be changed to use oil rich organically produced mixtures, like Bitter Canola, which as an artical from the early 2000, and featured in documentaries.  Suggested a process of turning waste oil into jet fuel.
1993 2018-09-20 20:07:35 Pour some oil on it
1994 2018-09-20 20:07:28 You can probably tell why I am skeptical of fat and lipid "experts" in FSANZ When  food scientists,technologists,industry oil chemists,industry dieticians  and marketers get together you often end up with a rancid result...
1995 2018-09-20 20:07:21 Fantastic piece @JournoJane It's astonishing how many times the words "palm oil" scream out at you from supermarket shelves. Dove - that most gentle of soaps.....
1996 2018-09-20 20:07:09 where does 920 million bbl of additional oil production fit in our carbon budget?
1997 2018-09-20 20:07:05 @NylesBot Please come do something with your Gavin, he has the windex and is shoving motor oil up his ass.
1998 2018-09-20 20:07:02 I need an oil change soooooooo bad. Who knows how to do them 
1999 2018-09-20 20:07:01 Do you agree that pipelines are safer than trains? RadicalGoats & I agreed on that point. If so, my opinion is that it is irresponsible to oppose pipelines but not trains. Or are those opposed by the "greens" too? My point is: the oil should be moved in the safest way possible.
2000 2018-09-20 20:07:00 My pops would be proud of me I’m out here getting my tires inspected , oil changed , paying attention to the maintenance light thingy .... Ima big girl now
2001 2018-09-20 20:06:37 i'm expressing that i do get frustrated when a new video drops using the farsali oil and everyone runs to buy it then returns it a week later bc they're mad it broke them out bc they're using it in a way it shouldn't be used. does that make sense?

2003 2018-09-20 20:06:23 Dave told me to get my oil changed 2 weeks ago.....
2004 2018-09-20 20:06:15 Finally getting my oil change
2005 2018-09-20 20:05:59 Your nonsense here is just lazy. It’s supply and demand. You don’t do shit for any country. We just invade countries to try to steal their oil.
2006 2018-09-20 20:05:49 The burying of the McCrone report was about more than just hiding Scotland's oil wealth, it was the realisation that an economically & politically strong Scotland was a threat to the British State/Establishment. This is why independence & #indyref2 is so vehemently opposed. JMV
2007 2018-09-20 20:05:39 do hair treatments tbh, or put coconut oil, i used to hate how oily it would make my hair but my hair is so soft now
2008 2018-09-20 20:05:31 stock up on CBD oil!
2009 2018-09-20 20:05:28 Continued - The people who send their money to millionaires such as Pat Robertson and Snake oil salesmen like him.. sure don't want to forget Pat Robertson  ... or Kenneth Copland .....
2010 2018-09-20 20:05:26 The terrorist came to KILL. THE TERRORIST LOST. IT IS ONLY TILL THE OIL MONEY IS AROUND YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS VIA SAUDI ARABIA!!!!
2011 2018-09-20 20:05:22 You can get the oil infused miceller water from garnier, or just heat coconut oil and use that on a cotton pad

2018 2018-09-20 20:04:16 money has ALWAYS come from Saudi Arabia, you can call it investment or oil tariff adjustments if that makes you feel better, but Saudi supported and funded jihadists have killed 10’s of 1’000’s of our country folk bro, you know exactly why I wrote what I wrote to the PM

2025 2018-09-20 20:03:32 we have no energy & youre not Australian<its been flogged off to private corps<from oil/gas to the power poles outside your house>ONLY way forward for Aus is to nationalise a resource or two & get our tax payer built assets/infrastructure BACK off the foreign non tax paying scum!
2026 2018-09-20 20:03:27 Saudia Arabia is going to Invest 100 billions $ and Going to Make  Oil City in #Gawadar. Alhamdulillah !!
Its Distinguished Development for Pakistan And its just cuz ov #Imran_Khan.
2027 2018-09-20 20:03:22 Oil !
2028 2018-09-20 20:03:10 It's obvious that the oil was already heated up at the stove...
2029 2018-09-20 20:03:04 I forgot I get free oil changes for 5 years
2030 2018-09-20 20:03:03 Is it burning oil?

2032 2018-09-20 20:02:58 Can someone tell the president that out of the 5 top oil producing countries only one is a member of OPEC.
2033 2018-09-20 20:02:52 ... & they torture them for days before, no food or water, give them laxatives, all to make them even weaker & they keep them in complete darkened & rub alcohol or oil into their eyes THAT’S WHY when they come out into the searing sun & noise they are all over the place TERRIFIED

2035 2018-09-20 20:02:43 Chemo and radiotherapy do NOT work. I’ve lost many relatives and loved one who had that treatment yet still died. Cannabis oil doesn’t kill
2036 2018-09-20 20:02:14 I told the mechanic which part of my car was leaking oil and he said he wasn't so sure about that, and they just called me to say I was right so, I win I guess. Yay me.
2037 2018-09-20 20:02:09 literally just got the check oil light flashing today 
2038 2018-09-20 20:02:02 Additionally, you can build any pipeline for toxic material as long as it isn't oil. It is a double standard in building pipelines. Environmental groups are just trying to increase expenses of companies through lawsuits, etc. Think of how much cheaper plant and car fuel...
2039 2018-09-20 20:02:01 Answer was meant to those who arent car ethusiasts like yourself or I. That’d be the best thing to do if someone is unsure about their oil change. No one invalidated your response bro. Not all people understand cars or will know what you know and clearly stated.
2040 2018-09-20 20:01:59 the left-"exactly! he will no longer be impartial. he must withdraw on that point alone!"
2041 2018-09-20 20:01:52 But who was plane? WHO WAS PLANE? Nuclear power is making dolphins violent! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2042 2018-09-20 20:01:51 Was until Aus olive oil gurus "scientists" and marketers downcried NZ healthy high polyphenol oil in favour of their cheaper  Aus supergrove product with organophosphates to fight those pesky Queensland fruitflies...We don't have those fruitflies here...
2043 2018-09-20 20:01:42 Same lol. I heard it had oil in it though years back so I had to investigate 
2044 2018-09-20 20:01:41 Then make more oil refineries here in this Country!!

2049 2018-09-20 20:01:21 Gracias 
2050 2018-09-20 20:01:12 It was a good strategic move. COAS takes china in confidence while @ImranKhanPTI n KSA agree to be strategic partners in cpec by building an oil city with an investment of $10bil. Now its a game changer for sure 
2051 2018-09-20 20:01:09 I wonder what was behind it? Maybe the 2014-15 collapse in oil prices which really pummeled the oil patch, a major source of good-paying blue collar job growth.
2052 2018-09-20 20:01:08 Not unless you put a fuckload of motor oil in it
2053 2018-09-20 20:01:03 the directions for my veggie marsala burger said to lightly oil a pre-heated pan so i used butter instead and had the heat up way too high 
2054 2018-09-20 20:00:58 #britainonpainkillers Disappointed not to hear Cannabis as an alternative to opioids. CBD oil is used by many as a safe alternative already in the U.K. @UPAllianceuk #cannabISmedicine

2061 2018-09-20 20:00:09 @macchour hi there I am starting a small weekly oil painting art class cum workshop in Macclesfield please contact me anitamevanzyl@gmail.com
2062 2018-09-20 20:00:01 Daily or as-needed cleaning of your granite counter tops or other natural-stone surface will reduce dirt, oil penetration and water spotting. Take another look, even if it looks clean.
2063 2018-09-20 19:59:55 Women literally don’t service their car at all, no oil changes, no washer fluid, if the car didn’t stop running without fuel they wouldn’t even put that in 
2064 2018-09-20 19:59:53 In the absence of it, the whole ET complex would likely trade better and with a multiple closer (not on par) to some of the other large midstreamers with NGL and/or oil value chain torque like OKE and EPD... Kelcy discount will persist as long as there are other options to own

2066 2018-09-20 19:59:40 Reliable 4 indiots only  we use @dawn_com just fr one thing nd tht is 2 absorb the excessive oil frm deep-fried food like #Pakora nd #Samosa 
It sounds ridiculous when an Indian rapist talk about ethnics nd values. Qauid e azam never wanted a secular Pakistan.
2067 2018-09-20 19:59:30 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
2068 2018-09-20 19:59:24 I wish there was an essential oil that smelled like fries #essentialoils #treatyoself #phdlife
2069 2018-09-20 19:59:17 There are few things that boiling oil can’t make delicious.
2070 2018-09-20 19:59:01 I’m missing ur point here . I get that most ppl can’t , do to life being busy, logistics of it all. But don’t try and sale snake oil to the masses about a bullshit diet.
2071 2018-09-20 19:59:00 Extra Virgin Olive Oil 
2072 2018-09-20 19:59:00 lrt omg me last night when my dad told me to call and schedule my oil change for this morning
2073 2018-09-20 19:58:56 16% of US exports go to Canada, 40% of oil imports come from Canada, between 2-9M US jobs depend on trade, not to mention services, and electricity imported from Canada feeds all of the northeast, not sure they should just bend over.
2074 2018-09-20 19:58:40  Few weeks ago I've decided to start to introduce more #veganproducts into my life. I cannot be % #vegan but, at least I'm taking small steps. So far I'm using soya milk, cruelty free/vegan shampoo & conditioner, coconut oil for almost everything. #Respect #earth #nature

2078 2018-09-20 19:58:27 You could also fire coal and oil and make a green economy.
Hydrogen trains and cars.
Maybe that could save the trembling American Empire and help you into the next century.
2079 2018-09-20 19:58:10 Worst idea. Putin wants pipeline Pac in Syria! What its about money and oil. Sell Purim ours we have enough fuel for a hundred years! Will be obsolete method in 20. Make money now! Sell it ! Clinton did!
2080 2018-09-20 19:58:08 #Teslin reduces its fuel oil consumption by abt 80,000 litres per year by using biomass. Not only that 96% of $$ spent stay in local community. With oil 95% of heating expenditures leave the #Yukon
2081 2018-09-20 19:58:07 How about we get oil?!  That way we don’t have to pay them.
2082 2018-09-20 19:57:56 Texas produces 4.6 million bbls of oil per day. More than all but 3 countries.  Texas will collect $15-19 billion royalties in 2018.  But my property taxes are out of control. Where is all the money going?

2085 2018-09-20 19:57:41 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2086 2018-09-20 19:57:21 CBD oil is not “weed” and how about, ITS NONE OF OUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
2087 2018-09-20 19:57:14 Eyes rolling. Oil is so last decade. It’s all about EVs and renewables. Very proud to never go to a gas station again with my new #Tesla #ElonMusk @elonmusk
2088 2018-09-20 19:57:10 Less than Scotland then i think we would manage just fine mr posey so its kinda lookin like its you thats mental,oh and thats just the oil,we have lots to offer,thats why wm lied and bullied people to vote no,and some dumplins fell for it,like you

2094 2018-09-20 19:56:23 Additionally I find it funny that you retired from a career that largely relies on oil as a source of revenue. #Hypocrite
2095 2018-09-20 19:56:17 Helt oacceptabelt. Alla borde bojkotta den barbariska Saudiska regimen - men det händer inte p g a oljan. Påminner om en cartoon på Economists förstasida 1974 med dåvarande brittiske PM, Ted Heath "I could do anything for oil!"
2096 2018-09-20 19:56:12 Energy Source              Death Rate (deaths per TWh)

Coal – China                       278
Coal – USA                         15

2098 2018-09-20 19:56:01 whose idea was it to give me dry yet acne prone skin that accepts nothing short of angel tears and $100 rose oil as a moisturizer? i want names.
2099 2018-09-20 19:55:39 He could oil his gun with the leftover ‘sheen’ from his hair #OilSlick #DirtyDonny
2100 2018-09-20 19:55:36 Only hard bitten oil patch boosters and far right Tories will feel like that. Everybody else will go for it like mad. This ought to put Andy Scheer into the teens unless he supports it. If it closes the tar sands that is a bonus.
2101 2018-09-20 19:55:29 Pffft this one dude I knew owned his own car and didnt even know he had to get his oil changed or know how to check his oil. I checked his oil for him and the dipstick was deadass DRY
2102 2018-09-20 19:55:22 ça reste rapide en auto, le problème c'est l'oil quand tu farm comme ça et comme au début tu peux pas faire de flotte low-cost ça descend vite
2103 2018-09-20 19:55:21 Wee rosey posey has blocked me after asking a question on Scottish oil,seems he does not want to hear the answer,funny that eh?considering Norway made 131 billion usd last year which is more than the scottish budget and what uk claims to spend on our behalf,and have extracted 3x
2104 2018-09-20 19:55:20 Statins can cause excruciating joint pain inmany! Krill oil or estra tabs are first line of drugs 4 increased cholesterol!
2105 2018-09-20 19:55:19 Didn't realise it was wine, thought it was posh olive oil.
2106 2018-09-20 19:55:18 I was looking at a Bugatti - Veyron model.  Just learned it costs about $20,000 for an oil change.  I'm out.
2107 2018-09-20 19:55:17 I’m so grateful I have 2 capable hands  so when housekeeping is in a rush I can clean up after my nasty roomie..  last night I was told the oil field is a man’s job.. Ha idiot, it’s an adventure into the human psyche#BadDecisionsIHaveMade #ThankfulThursday #FearTheWalkingDead
2108 2018-09-20 19:54:59 If I don’t get my oil changed like yesterday my car is going to blow up
2109 2018-09-20 19:54:55 Oil sources are pretty damn widespread, vast reserves on every continent, and the US is now producing more than even Saudi Arabia is.
2110 2018-09-20 19:54:43 This is true, we need to be able to export our oil to the global market.
2111 2018-09-20 19:54:38 Bearish Factors - With $70+/barrel crude oil prices,
associated gas production will continue
to surge.  An additional 4.5Bcf/day of natural
gas is expected to hit the market by
the end of October as new pipelines
go into service.

2113 2018-09-20 19:54:34 My  oil got delivered today 
2114 2018-09-20 19:54:32 Fun fact: your foundation doesn’t oxidize. Your face has too much moisture on it, whether it’s oil or unabsorbed moisturizer. That’s why your foundation is turning orange, not because it’s reacting to oxygen. I’m getting tired of people throwing around that term incorrectly.
2115 2018-09-20 19:54:20 Have some oil. Stop begging.
2116 2018-09-20 19:54:12 Tbh I only get oil changes on time because they're all free 
2117 2018-09-20 19:54:07 I had a jar of pre-mixed lemon juice and olive oil (with a couple red pepper flakes) that I kept in the fridge, and could drizzle on my avocado toasts, which made things nice. And I kept a small pair of salt and pepper grinders in my desk drawer.
2118 2018-09-20 19:54:03 It's a cartel. It controls world oil prices, that makes it imperative that the US develop alternative fuel sources. I thought you were a businessman.
2119 2018-09-20 19:54:01 When did the @RIBA last oil paint a President? Have you visited the ICE? That’s even worse!
2120 2018-09-20 19:53:37 re impact? fair question. IMO it's a weakness of the CLP.  AFAIK there are no targets for CO2 reductions, apart from a cap on oilsands emissions of 100 GT/y (higher than today's 70)

there's this: "Alberta will reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations by 45% by 2025".
2121 2018-09-20 19:53:36 Well you're not a billionaire who stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if we ditch coal and oil. Pay the politicians some now and make it and more back over the next few decades. Who cares if America is last in clean energy when you got billions on top of your billions?
2122 2018-09-20 19:53:35 There is so much oil wealth in Nigeria. Yet only few people control all this wealth.
2123 2018-09-20 19:53:27 Today I got an oil change without my dad literally forcing me to, so I guess I’m an adult now. 
2124 2018-09-20 19:53:26 I do not want Kavanaugh 2 hv any say in laws that affect my ability to make decisions abt my own body unless he agrees to be castrated.

2140 2018-09-20 19:51:56 Personally the pantene gold is heavy on my hair, i love it tho. So is the argon oil creme of nature and it also has a very strong masculine scent to me.  Thats all i have tried for winter months.. i think
2141 2018-09-20 19:51:56 It's a lie o. They will tie it again and soak it in hot oil so even a derica of rice go hard for person to see.
2142 2018-09-20 19:51:45 I’m leery of your tweets and what you Actually know about the oil and gas industry.
2143 2018-09-20 19:51:33 I’m no oil painting though.

2145 2018-09-20 19:51:14 See! Told you! You got the oil?
2146 2018-09-20 19:51:05 Is this the official conjecture of the USA that their wars in the Middle East are fought over oil?
2147 2018-09-20 19:50:45 Not going to VA this weekend. Gotta get an oil change and i don’t have time today

2156 2018-09-20 19:49:56 @realDonaldTrump How long do you want to be kind to treat China and India? Everybody was tired. China, and India, or you can cut off your oil from Iran by November 4, or collect your supplies and go from the US. All Chinese and Indian refineries know there is no exemption
2157 2018-09-20 19:49:54 The olive oil is like, whatever, and definitely a waste to me, but exchanging the oil for applesauce is absolutely wild.  Who comes up with this shit?

2166 2018-09-20 19:48:40 I live a block from the beach at English Bay and each day garbage trucks tip containers of trash, sending loose plastic bags into the air and blowing towards the sea. Sounds like an easy fix for an Environment Minister, instead of hard selling pipelines and oil tankers!
2167 2018-09-20 19:48:33 Those are much more easily replaced than oil, and sources are more widespread. They are also used in capital stock rather than for ongoing operations, so the economy will be much less sensitive to price shocks in those materials.
2168 2018-09-20 19:48:28 I’ll be reigniting my oils debate soon olive oil palm oil rape oil those who remember it be on standby
2169 2018-09-20 19:47:59 A sad day in America when big oil companies and Trump destroy all our natural treasures.
2170 2018-09-20 19:47:57 Won't happen. Emir of Abu Dhabi (president of UAE) won't let it. Emirates belongs to Dubai which is a long way second in rank to Abu Dhabi in the emirates. Dubai is one big city, Abu Dhabi is a slightly smaller city but has a lot of territory and A LOT of oil.
2171 2018-09-20 19:47:28 Don't worry.. It's been reshaped.. don't you see how Pakistan took oil city project from Chinese & gave to saudi arabia after taking China in full confidence..
it means now Pakistan is on driving seat of #CPEC project
2172 2018-09-20 19:47:17 Hence the US should do what it can after it had its own period of cheap coal industrialization too. Why wouldn't you want to diversify your electricity sources and export revenue? Because your oil companies said it's useless?
2173 2018-09-20 19:47:08 Instantly smelled gun oil when I looked at this lol
2174 2018-09-20 19:46:45 Why, USA is self sufficient oil companies sitting on capped wells and stored crude.  What we need is additional refineries to process the crude.

2196 2018-09-20 19:45:09 Ugh I guess I go get my oil change 
2197 2018-09-20 19:45:05 All my family is from Kansas too because of oil and gas. In fact, if I was in the oil and gas business, I’d be 5th generation.
2198 2018-09-20 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2199 2018-09-20 19:45:03 Just to let y’all know that jojoba oil is great for the first stage of a healing tattoo. Apply that shit first, let the skin absorb it for 10 minutes and put vitamin A&D ointment. It really speeds up the healing and swelling 
2200 2018-09-20 19:44:52 Want to lower oil prices? Just follow the Bush administration's footsteps. 9/11 2.0
2201 2018-09-20 19:44:51 Oil like coal is a finite resource!  Let me put it language you can understand there is a limit on coal and oil.  We should be leading the world in renewable energy not turning back the clock to resources that will peter out soon.  Why should we be at the mercy of the Middle East
2202 2018-09-20 19:44:50 True.

And if we become as dependent on lithium, nickel and cobalt for batteries as we are on oil, the military will be spending billions defending those resources as well.
2203 2018-09-20 19:44:39 Who tryna pay for my oil change??
2204 2018-09-20 19:44:38 I headed the coconut oil in a pan on the stove, waited until it melted and cooled enough to touch, and then applied it to my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes. Then washed it out.
2205 2018-09-20 19:44:30 Dipwad, we need to get AWAY from Oil and rely on renewable sources.

2207 2018-09-20 19:44:11 You're ignoring the the potential of an industry that will make US the world top producer of oil and gas

'1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas in shale rock beneath northern England. Extracting a tenth would meet Britain’s gas needs for more than 40 years'
2208 2018-09-20 19:44:00 Okay but a tablespoon of fish sauce and lime juice plus a 1/4 teaspoon of chili oil makes chicken ramen absolutely superb

2213 2018-09-20 19:42:40 *straddling your legs gently as you lay on the bed, thinking how beautiful you look as I heat the oil up in my hands before starting to massage you*
2214 2018-09-20 19:42:37 It was about gold oil people displacement you no
2215 2018-09-20 19:42:36 To be fair he probably doesn't even know Iran produces oil.
2216 2018-09-20 19:42:34 I know. Probably no oil painting.
2217 2018-09-20 19:42:30 Yes, exploiting public lands with oil wells and now U.S. oceans really enhances the landscapes! You are full of it.
2218 2018-09-20 19:42:26 #MasterChefUK Greg really is a simpleton. Childish shocked reaction when informed someone is making mayonnaise. Wow... just wow. Let’s turn on a blender and trickle oil into egg yolks and mustard. Immediate Michelin star should be awarded.
2219 2018-09-20 19:42:24 Not every 3000 it depends on the oil type u put in the car if it uses synthetic or reg oil
2220 2018-09-20 19:42:06 WOW the Milk Makeup Oil Stick is so fuckin nice for my dry ass skin
2221 2018-09-20 19:42:05 @realDonaldTrump letting the earth destroying oil company’s to have less restrictions of the polluting gasses from their drilling on public land, again #Trump continues to trash our planet and not give, a fat orange piece of shit, damn #IdiotInChief
2222 2018-09-20 19:41:42 Which Middle Eastern countries are you protecting? Yemen? Oh wait, youre helping Saudi Arabia destroy them, to protect your access to oil.

Who will protect the Middle East from us?

#ThursdayThoughts
2223 2018-09-20 19:41:36 As #Saturn eases out, oil prices must fall for additional supply (and lower demand). Recent retrogression of Saturn led to oil price movement. Saturn is principal planet for oil. Yes sidereal Saturn in Sagittarius too lowered real estate prices. Real estate to see more downturn.
2224 2018-09-20 19:41:33 I thought Colorado had oil and gas methane rule. Am I wrong?
2225 2018-09-20 19:41:27 CBD oil smells like......

IMF Externalities:  Prices Do Not Capture All Costs.

Pollution from coal, oil increase our health care costs by trillions dollars over time.

USA could obtain most of its energy from hemp fuel while reducing health care & energy costs.

Environmental benefits of hemp McGill
2228 2018-09-20 19:41:21 Suleman want other biz. Instead of oil
2229 2018-09-20 19:41:13 Dow Transportation Index has diverged from the Dow Industrial Average. Could this direction be due to oil rather than tariffs? The industrial sector appears to be doing pretty good. So, the divergence doesn't really make a whole lot of sense here.
2230 2018-09-20 19:41:10 Ah, but in the medium term EVs will reduce oil use. In any case, the full cost of fossil fuels should be factored into prices, and if done properly, would show that #fossilfuelsarenotcheap unless you don't count all the costs.
2231 2018-09-20 19:40:57 In other words, no one cares about investigating Paisley's "oil deal" offer anymore. He can do what he likes.

2238 2018-09-20 19:39:59 Remember that one time I never got my oil changed and my car died on the highway 
2239 2018-09-20 19:39:49 “Supportive of the military” isn’t a thing for me.  Unless that support involves keeping them from not being sent to die in some foreign land over oil or other concocted reason
2240 2018-09-20 19:39:40 Let us move to stop being so dependant on oil and coal. Let us develop new sources if clean energy. But you are against that.

His dad was pm strike 2      
Long history against oil  strike 3 
The budget will balance itself.  Extra strike because they stopped counting kids games. 
So ask how did this ever happen
2246 2018-09-20 19:38:53 I’ve come to discover that it’s because of the peanut oil. So I have to resort to eating the grilled chicken 
2247 2018-09-20 19:38:46 Don’t say the oil word too loud. Someone in Washington hears that, next thing you know Pentagon is wargaming liberation of Shetland from Scandinavian oppressors. Then US defence contractors are arming warlords in Aberdeen & Oslo at massive profit margins.
2248 2018-09-20 19:38:37 Perhaps you missed it, they are also bringing it in from the US and Mexico!

2250 2018-09-20 19:38:18 yet we also must look at 1944 replacement of Henry Wallace with Truman as VP . This was done be Southern and Oil factions of the dems..
2251 2018-09-20 19:38:17 the article does suggest that there is more to the Canadian economy than peddling oil, something most Conservatives seem unable to wrap their heads around.

2253 2018-09-20 19:38:08 We are falling behind in infrastructure. We shouldn’t go to the past ( coal and oil) we should go to the future. Solar, wind,water energy. Don’t take us back in time!
2254 2018-09-20 19:38:05 Yesssss it’s like the only oil I ever have in the diffuser so I’m kicking myself for not raiding the trees in the backyard sooner. 
2255 2018-09-20 19:37:56 The two go together like oil and water Richard!!
2256 2018-09-20 19:37:54 Most welcome  and happy anniversary 
2257 2018-09-20 19:37:45 Also, where do you get off charging over £350 for a basic oil change? Even I know that’s daylight robbery  how can you even justify that kind of mark up @BMW_UK
2258 2018-09-20 19:37:43 Aren't they?

2260 2018-09-20 19:37:38 Hi Reza .. i have question... why you analyze with two ways the ES and oil with market profile and the currencies with the swing method?... thanks
2261 2018-09-20 19:37:27  i literally just texted him the other day about how i checked and my oil is fine
2262 2018-09-20 19:37:25 What a brave position on oil prices! And what total bullshit!
2263 2018-09-20 19:37:19 "$1.60 is the new normal" BULLSHIT! The last time fuel was this expensive the oil price was $110 a barrel, now it's only about $70 and petrol is just as expensive. New normal, my arse!!! Just an excuse to rip people off even more. Arseholes #auspol #accc #oil #FuelPriceHike

2266 2018-09-20 19:37:07 They will not make it easy. They tried to sink Ireland and we know the brutality they are capable of. This time rUK will find itself very isolated, out of the EU, out of the Union and no oil, whisky or food revenue.
2267 2018-09-20 19:36:58 Is she standing  right inside the palm oil?
2268 2018-09-20 19:36:56 I hate coming to the dealership to get oil changes because i have to look at my cars 2018 version and admire the hell out of it and just wish why isnt this the 2017 version I wish I could change my car every year like I change my phone every year
2269 2018-09-20 19:36:50 It's called massive money printing. Each  central bank takes a turn. We gave survived the last 10 years due to massive money printing. With more countries not trading with the dollar, all those extra ones are making it's way back into out country. We need to start selling oil.
2270 2018-09-20 19:36:38 I see this just as tough guy Twitter-posturing for his base, giving him an out to deflect blame for economic effects of rising oil prices. I doubt the Saudi energy ministers & other OPEC leaders are caring much about his tweets
2271 2018-09-20 19:36:37 Bro they already did that with fuel tax. that 8% is tax on whatever was on top of sh 52 per litre which is the retail value of oil. They already did that
2272 2018-09-20 19:36:26 Allah's blessing brother.
2273 2018-09-20 19:36:25 We need energy independence. How about nationalization? Big oil is my biggest pet peeve. Government sanctioned collusion
I’m no socialist but  enough of them bleeding our country.
2274 2018-09-20 19:36:03 Oil is not as fungible as most think due to refinery configurations.
2275 2018-09-20 19:35:50 CBD oil is illegal there? It's not illegal in the states even if MJ is illegal in the state. Only medical is approved in florida but stores sell CBD here.

2286 2018-09-20 19:34:47 The most important now is to save Sonatrach and get her back one of the largest oil and gas entities within this industry in the region.
2287 2018-09-20 19:34:33 Great call to keep oil prices (which have been going up) in check
2288 2018-09-20 19:34:33 This bloke wouldn't be out of place preaching to the flat earth society or peddling snake oil from a horse drawn caravan.
2289 2018-09-20 19:34:23 Permian E&Ps doing well this year - would prob be align better with Texas oil output relative to Russell Index
2290 2018-09-20 19:34:22 And it doesn't have oil so why would the gov't bother to use money on this?
2291 2018-09-20 19:34:22 Anyone that can do the math knows otherwise...

Also, is the US obligated to buy oil for Venezuela to function? (Not that the US stopped buying oil).

Why can't they just "do more socialism" to fix things?
2292 2018-09-20 19:34:09 Once my dog ate weed that we threw away because we made oil and we didn’t realize until after $600 of emergency vet bills so just let her? Him? Sleep it off and they’ll be aight

2294 2018-09-20 19:34:02 I just need a hot oil treatment between cuts to maintain the softness at the ends
2295 2018-09-20 19:33:56 @Ford I am devastated that you discontinued “the works”. It was the only reason I got my oil changed at the dealership since it did everything for a reasonable price. I will never get service at the dealership again as a result of this discontinuation. #BringBackTheWorks
2296 2018-09-20 19:33:45 So Saudia would become a part of CPEC and "Oil City" would be launched in Gawadar which would not only help in Decrease in Oil prices but also creates Jobs.

2311 2018-09-20 19:32:08 Ah, Dumpster, a large part of the oil price is supply and demand. It’s basic econ 101. And, by the way, the oil price is currently very low, though not at its lowest, compared to the last 20years. Why do you keep displaying your stupidity?
2312 2018-09-20 19:32:03 like backcountry miles in the oil fields vs highway miles. engine death within 2-3 years.

6. I’m coming to get my oil back
2331 2018-09-20 19:29:54 That also makes me more bullish if it's effectively ready to roll excess capacity (if we don't see an oversupply as a result of this quickly deployed capacity). The future for the equitues should look like a high beta oil price

2338 2018-09-20 19:29:27 Investors right now do not believe 1) oil prices can rise and 2) consolidation/shaking out the dumb money.
2339 2018-09-20 19:29:19 It was around 11k for the car. But it was pretty new and only 70k miles on it. I'll get a lot of life out of it after it's paid off. Plus I get two free complete oil changes a year, so I save money on that. :D And it means I actually GO for my oil changes.

2343 2018-09-20 19:28:43 I was getting my oil changed and talking to a recruiter about a potential job while I was waiting,,, and the Big O Tires manager overheard and offered me a job there

2356 2018-09-20 19:27:25 Answer is there Oil at this time Chine is the biggest buyer of oil in the world and Iran is also trying to sale their oil to China if they (SA) are get the Partnership then Chin should be bound to buy their oil so indirectly benefits goes to Saudis too.
2357 2018-09-20 19:27:20 you guys need to stick to oil!!!!!!!!!!! and not CBD oil either
2358 2018-09-20 19:27:15 Invest in renewable energy sources drain the demand for oil and the price will come down. 

I am sure @Wharton taught the basics of supply and demand.
2359 2018-09-20 19:27:08 The nukes are the only thing that keeps them relevant and 10 million bpd od oil. If not for that they would be a bunch of drunks driving Volgas.

2369 2018-09-20 19:25:57 YO! @POTUS I have an idea! 
Stop using oil, problem solved. Take home troops, reduce deficit and more. 
Impossible? Well It was impossible to go to the moon too, before American engineers invented a way. 
Come on , make something  and stop whining

2372 2018-09-20 19:25:50 If the Saudi losers do NOT lower the prices we should invade them and take all the oil!

Unless Markets tumble, then they’ll blame oil or USD

Then further Iran / Russia sanction.

2375 2018-09-20 19:25:30 Dear NZ, please legalize weed so that I can use CBD oil.
It really helped my TMJ and neck that wants to kill me!
I used all the oil while I was in Cali.

2377 2018-09-20 19:25:12 I think the price is impacted by the US dollar, dollar up oil prices, up.  You want the dollar to go down?  that would solve the problem.
2378 2018-09-20 19:25:08 Over 5,000 energy patents suppressed in the name of "national security" and the U.S. Patent Office under the control of U.K. based company Serco.  C'mon @POTUS, make America REALLY GREAT!  Stand up to Big Oil (Deep State), cut their purse strings!

2380 2018-09-20 19:24:34 CBD oil varies widely in flavor, I’ve found. From slightly unpleasant to chewing on cannabis clippings so bad it’ll make you gag. Heartburn, too. Might take a while to find a brand that’s palatable.
2381 2018-09-20 19:24:31 See ya know how they be trying to hustle us woman outta all this extra shit on top of oil change lol 
Do I look like a Wilfred  make ya sick. Glad I’m not the only one it’s happened to

2384 2018-09-20 19:24:01 What about renewable energy or does that not fit with lining the pockets of your oil friends and lobbyist?
2385 2018-09-20 19:23:59 Girl who sits next to me won’t take ‘pharmaceuticals’but other holistic remedies. Today she asked why it takes her ages to get better. You’re trying to cure a cold with eucalyptus oil. I mean what is the life expectancy of a Koala?
2386 2018-09-20 19:23:55 Did you even read what I wrote? The US will be refining the oil they get for use in PADD 5 while the extra capacity will allow us to get the refined fuels we need directly from Canadian sources instead of from the US refineries.

2388 2018-09-20 19:23:51 You are wonder Sr @pursuedbytruth You show folks that the Religious are people not just automatons. Your tweets are a bit of grace in my day. Keep the oil handy and the lamp lit. You are doing it right.
2389 2018-09-20 19:23:47 I take a B complex that has a little vitamin c mixed in, a whole spectrum black cumin seed joint, and cranberry extract. I need to get a good fish oil joint too
2390 2018-09-20 19:23:44 hello guys. my mom makes me this kickass hair oil that makes me hair grow like crazy (note: i am a v stressed med student and constant stress made me struggle with a lot of hair loss and frizzy hair)
this hair oil was a complete game changer. thought i should share :p
2391 2018-09-20 19:23:40 I think the Trump-Putin alliance has been about oil all along. That's why Republican senators from proposed pipeline states made the trip to Russia. It all comes down to money and greed.
2392 2018-09-20 19:23:33 What's the point of scheduling my oil change if imma still have to wait an hour 
2393 2018-09-20 19:23:28 Don’t understand, the oil price higher good for America, or bad? Seems not bad now
2394 2018-09-20 19:23:27 *We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now.*
2395 2018-09-20 19:23:21 Oil Prices steadied after U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to “get prices down now!”, slowing an upward surge that has pushed the market toward four-year highs.
2396 2018-09-20 19:23:19 Who tf puts olive oil in mashed potatoes
2397 2018-09-20 19:23:15 I literally looked at my windshield yesterday and realized I’m overdue for an oil change. And a tire rotation. 
2398 2018-09-20 19:23:10 Coconut oil, honey, aloe.
2399 2018-09-20 19:23:05 Yo i put Pepperment Oil in my diffuser and it smells like christmas time at my pricing station.

I keep a few small brokerage accts so I can play Portfolio Manager. 

That's it

2402 2018-09-20 19:23:00 This is kinda reminiscent of the Federal BLM employees who were found to be using computers for porno watching during gulf oil spill/fire and Nevada Ranch incident, where BLM aimed rifles at citizens.
2403 2018-09-20 19:22:58 My so called friend got a dab ready for me while I was going to the bathroom, he dipped it in fucking extracted chili oil... needless to say, I was crying, but still finished the dab

2406 2018-09-20 19:22:29 Will see massive amounts pouring in 2019/20, going into store of value tokens and tokenised infrastructure protocols. Tokens are the new oil and hording the right ones is a massive jackpot. Also, most VCs in this space are still amateurs with insane returns. Better ones will ente
2407 2018-09-20 19:22:26 @HumbleMechanic sorry to bother you with a question about an older video but do you know the part number for the O ring that you spoke about on your TSI phantom oil leak video? Having a similar issue as described during that video.
2408 2018-09-20 19:22:17 #I_Deplorable
Is it really the fault of people that consider themselves Democrats, that they have fallen for people selling snake oil, I don’t think so, to a degree. There are those that just want to be Democrat because they want more social programs and less oversight.
2409 2018-09-20 19:22:07 And it’s barely being talked about here because Oil is king. They are so entrenched in our elections, it’s a miracle more people aren’t being shot at. Prop 112 activists have been facing harassment and death threats, and Polis sold out. No one is protecting us.
2410 2018-09-20 19:21:53 Lmao I’m reading this getting my oil changed rn, I’ve been avoiding it

2412 2018-09-20 19:21:47 Yes we protect Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kowait 40% of OPEC production, 20% more than the US production. If these countries were not safe, in a war with Iran or others, we would not see oil at $80 but way above $100+ if not rationing, yes protecting them is in our best interest too
2413 2018-09-20 19:21:43 If you smoke daily it would benefit you greatly to drink a lot more water and eat more fruit to prevent de-hydration of cells. Massage your skin with  regularly and organic coconut oil. You're not really hungry, you are mostly THIRSTY 
2414 2018-09-20 19:21:39 Burned the fuck out of my wrist and hand while cooking. Got a sizeable amount of oil splashed on it and holy fuck it feels like my wrist is on fire ;3;

2424 2018-09-20 19:20:15 Americans should rely less on foreign oil We should be able to get our own oil on our own soil anywhere in America for Americans I don't care about an ocean view I want oil for my gas tank
2425 2018-09-20 19:20:13 The flaw in your theory is… we protect the Middle East BECAUSE oil is valuable. If the price wasn't high it wouldn't be worth protecting.
2426 2018-09-20 19:20:09 That's how capitalism works, they have the supply, we have the demand. We pay what they want because we can't give up our reliance on oil. Our protection keeps prices lower and oil flowing. Maybe look into innovating non-oil energy sources and get off oil.
2427 2018-09-20 19:20:09 I'm not sure cultivation is the right word,  I'm thinking of palm oil plantations now.
2428 2018-09-20 19:20:04 I’m having a bath with an oil that will help my relax my muscles.. I hope haha
2429 2018-09-20 19:19:44 @WilfredFrost Wilfred, do you use the microwave bags of popcorn, or do you just use popcorn in a brown paper bag with a small amount of olive oil, which is much better for you.  The silver strip in the prepackaged bag is not good.

2433 2018-09-20 19:19:12 "That sounds interesting, yeah," he says with a grin. Storage rooms were great for playing.

Shadows dance in the flickering candlelight as they move, giving the figures in oil paintings the impression of moving.

"Feels like their eyes are following us," Thomas whispers.

2442 2018-09-20 19:18:14 Sir,u should be the face for opposition not @RahulGandhi who's I.Q. is below the room temperature.And @BJP4India govt should realize the responsibility they should take as a high authority,they r actually insensitive,if the ques. is about oil price or #SCSTAct @narendramodi_in

2450 2018-09-20 19:18:00 Wind and sun don't really compete in the same market as oil though - wind and sun make electricity, the US grid is less than 1% oil-burning (and most of that is in Hawaii).
2451 2018-09-20 19:17:40 Y’all should fight for dominance! 

I’m think Greek wrestling would be the best and fairest way. No clothes, lots of oil, in the mud... 

Yup! That’s a good plan
2452 2018-09-20 19:17:40 not the point, I know, but:

the "essential" in "essential oil" does not mean the same thing it does in "essential amino acid".

An essential amino acid is one your body needs but cannot produce. An "essential" oil is just an oil extracted from something.
2453 2018-09-20 19:17:38 I've just up ours on but need to order oil so it won't be on long!
2454 2018-09-20 19:17:35 We get very little of our oil from the Mid East.  If you weren't such an moronic mushroom dick, you would know this.

2462 2018-09-20 19:16:27 US sanctions padhe Iran pe? Ye padha ki agar India ne October tak Iran se oil imports nahi bandh kiye to India pe bhi sanctions lag sakte hain? Russian oil, gas bhi nahi aa Paa Raha sanctions ke Karan, Russian diamond bhi nahi aa Paa Raha. But oil kum produce hone se cost badhi

2474 2018-09-20 19:14:56 A sign that the people of Vancouver are too smart to fall for oil industry propaganda. Sad that you have. Please learn to be more critical of biased industry nonsense.
2475 2018-09-20 19:14:56 Your welcome. Appreciate all the info you provide on gas prices and the oil industry. Great work.
2476 2018-09-20 19:14:56 Why are you attacking a company with investments in Te oil industry?  They own that pipeline, making the federal government part of the oil industry now.

2478 2018-09-20 19:14:42 years ago the US made promises and treaties that donald and company reneged on because they didn’t like them, plus they cut into OIL and Gas profits.

2489 2018-09-20 19:13:27 I would go but would put off bloodwork for months because I swore I could "turn it all around" with fish oil and the gym.
2490 2018-09-20 19:13:19 Ordered some grape seed and Sweet almond oil, some new Clay’s & marshmallow root now I can finally make my oil based mask

2497 2018-09-20 19:12:13 We must not be celebrating exporting oil seeds we are going to import back the oil at double price. As a nation we must have equipment to press these seeds into oil and export something which have better value
2498 2018-09-20 19:12:09 That's not Sports Casual nor a free black bomber jacket with a leading oil manufacturer's full colour logo embroidered into the back of it.

Disappointing.
2499 2018-09-20 19:12:04 I remember this debate years ago about gas prices and oil prices. Everyone wanted to keep it at a level that everyone could make a good profit. It's some what higher than it was.
2500 2018-09-20 19:12:00 Edible dough plates in greece, was brought to Italy from greece, and orob greece from egypt.  Neopolitan pizza is very diff than sicialian pizza or american pizza, it is very fine and often topped with oil and vinegar and arugula.
2501 2018-09-20 19:11:59 You country issues & problems will not be solved by decreasing the Middle East oil prices. Cheap oil prices = lower income, that will make -paying you- a tough task! Why buy an expensive hotdog  if we can go for cheap noddles !
2502 2018-09-20 19:11:51 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2503 2018-09-20 19:11:46 #thursdaythoughts How is oil and single use plastic related to one another? 
2504 2018-09-20 19:11:44 Big Oil loves Trump and EPA restriction erasures . Off Shore Drilling also .
2505 2018-09-20 19:11:28 I ate that when I was a little boy lol, good ol days where we mix ijebu stainless garri with Palm oil mixed with sugar, life was awesome!
2506 2018-09-20 19:11:25 Once again #littleDonnieRump is having delusions of grandeur. Just because you're the #FakePOTUS it doesn't mean that you have the power to dictate to OPEC what the price of their oil is to be. And your threats will fall on deaf ears, as they should.
2507 2018-09-20 19:11:11 Completely agree. Also don't believe the hype that it is more expensive to shop this way. We are a traditional, rather than a luvvy #farmshop offering local fruit & veg at a very fair price because we don't have the transport & storage costs. #ShopLocal
2508 2018-09-20 19:10:59 @AngelaBocca spoke on Thom Hartman’s show today. She seems to be a leader and journalist for cannabis and medical marijuana. She’s a wea￼th of information on the benefits of cannabis and CBD oil.

2510 2018-09-20 19:10:53 Meh, snake oil. Standards are more important to me and ProtonMail is not based on standards. Notice how you need a “bridge” to connect to their email.
2511 2018-09-20 19:10:46 Controversial, but I find marijuana or CBD oil helps me with mine xx
2512 2018-09-20 19:10:37 Nothing like putting liquid butter on a 8 corner deep dish that came out of a dirty pan filled with a cup of oil and cooked for 8 mins then repeat.. right @JetsPizza
2513 2018-09-20 19:10:34 Absolutely  gorgeous  mate  bit of lemon  and garlic  olive oil coriander drizzle  over

2521 2018-09-20 19:10:01 put oil in your hair, use that expensive lipstick you’ve been saving up for special occasions, take a hot shower with a bunch of candles, smother yourself in lovely smelling lotion, play your favorite game, go see a movie with your favorite people, or stay in today and do nothing
2522 2018-09-20 19:09:57 Dear Donald when u applied oil sanctions on iran u should thought about oil price ur policy is very bad dear
2523 2018-09-20 19:09:51 NM? Are you speaking of the supposedly failed synthetic oil production that our tax money paid to develop? It would fit their pattern of corporate profits after tax payers fund research...  Look into it folks.
2524 2018-09-20 19:09:50 U da man - great  pint re oil prices  - making America greater 
2525 2018-09-20 19:09:42 Probably doesn’t  even need changed cause it probably hasn’t seen any oil for about 6,000 miles

2530 2018-09-20 19:09:30 Sunflower oil, vitamin C + E oil!
2531 2018-09-20 19:09:28 Baba Yaga went away somewhere or other, so she poured oil on the Baba Yaga. Well, the loom, and be off.

2536 2018-09-20 19:08:34 i was supposed to be doing a research group project on oil power plants and at some point i got distracted and started searching about coal power plants and i forgot my project was actually about oil and now i have to re do the whole thing bc it’s due on
2537 2018-09-20 19:08:33 Not one foot of 30 ft wall been built.
Why? Because everyone knows it will reduce illegals and people will want more wall.
EVeify is not mandatory. Why? Because it works.
ICE is effective, why the calls to get rid of it.
ANYTHING effective has opponents
2538 2018-09-20 19:08:28 Guess it has to be said again.  They bought an existing pipeline, built in the 50s ships oil all the time.
2539 2018-09-20 19:08:27 Yes. If you think you’re attorney, doctor, or accountant doesn’t smoke or use cannabis oil, then boy are you in for a surprise. LOL

2546 2018-09-20 19:07:32 Does this count the ones you've been in? I think I hit that number on just those. 
... probably round 20-30 - the oil tanker that bridged itself was especially impressive. They had to repave the road.
2547 2018-09-20 19:07:25 I went so long without oil in my car... like weeks/months. She still drove like a charm
2548 2018-09-20 19:07:17 Medical Marijuana in the form of an oil extract called RSO Rick Simpson oil CURED my stage 4b Hodgkins lymphoma with Mets to spleen and bone marrow three years ago in less than 4 months, YEAH! and No one cares.
Not my doctors, insurance company, government or MSM!
2549 2018-09-20 19:07:07 I gotta go get an oil change cause I remembered because of that tweet lmao
2550 2018-09-20 19:07:05 One car payment, new car battery and oil change later... I guess I’ll be selling all of my personal belongings.
2551 2018-09-20 19:07:05 @realDonaldTrump I have not seen such a weak man all my life. If Iran's oil exports do not reach zero by November, then you should close your suitcases
2552 2018-09-20 19:07:01 If I need an oil change today, but I’m taking my car for inspection Tuesday, can I wait? Asking for myself 
2553 2018-09-20 19:06:59 Screw weather apps. My jar of coconut oil is boss. #solid #liquid #pantsweather #shortsweather
2554 2018-09-20 19:06:59 Surprise, they were safe and free to live the way they wanted to, we just keep getting involved because we wanted to set oil prices. At one time we supported all the sides of the conflict depending on who we thought we could control.
2555 2018-09-20 19:05:54 And if as you say "Gamble". Why would Trudeau gamble 4.5 billion on oil?
2556 2018-09-20 19:05:53 Of course it would do it on a Friday night.  Olive oil?
2557 2018-09-20 19:05:53 Very
2558 2018-09-20 19:05:52 I would like to recommend CBD oil. It helps me with anxiety, depression, PTSD ect. Also hate all these shootings.
2559 2018-09-20 19:05:45 Are you saying increase output to make up for your new sanctions on Iran that led the oil prices to go up? Their economies rely on high oil prices - they don’t need our protection as much as we need to spend on military so we keep the game going.
2560 2018-09-20 19:05:43 I have a 7 year warranty and life time oil change I’m chilling lmao
2561 2018-09-20 19:05:37 Stop exporting American oil. That will bring prices down for American consumers.
2562 2018-09-20 19:05:36 I must’ve woke up and wanted to be some crispy ass bacon because I got all this coconut oil on and it’s 96 fucking degrees outside. 
2563 2018-09-20 19:05:24 Undecided yet, might copy you or fry the fish in a small amount of  olive oil 
2564 2018-09-20 19:05:23 Black seed oil .. 
2565 2018-09-20 19:05:21 you’ll need to do more than just change the oil for me
2566 2018-09-20 19:05:20 You deserve worse. If you vote yes for this guy who says it’s settled law until 5 judges say it isn’t. We SAW that. You can pretend you’re stupid and say oh he promised or whatever your excuse is but we know he WILL overturn Roe. He WILL rule against women just like Thomas
2567 2018-09-20 19:05:06 Nope...
Specially selected potatoes, vegetable oil, seasoning (sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, lactose, acetic acid, sodium acetate, dehydrated vegetable powder [tomato, garlic, onion]...
2568 2018-09-20 19:05:06 4 minutes!  That's going some
2569 2018-09-20 19:05:02 i use like 4 different oils vitamin E,argan, jamaican castor, & olive oil & with dummy conditioners.

2574 2018-09-20 19:04:35 Oil against protection is a foolish expression , prices to be determined according to the market ( demand &offer)
2575 2018-09-20 19:04:29 Rarely hydrate my skin with serums or oils. One day before the event, smeared my face in so much facial oil, i am afraid US might invade it.
2576 2018-09-20 19:04:12 No day is wasted when it’s spent organising an emergency oil tank installation.
2577 2018-09-20 19:04:12 Uni update- i made roast veg for tea last night and forgot i had no oil. I used my coconut oil from doing drag for my food. I feel like @courtneyact

2583 2018-09-20 19:03:43 @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn

An ally like a labour government ? Money it gets GIVEN ? 

This from the labour party who hid then stole Scotland's oil, fisheries, gold, pensions and trust ! The VOW !!

Ffs, allies like that who needs enemies ?
2584 2018-09-20 19:03:39 Uhm excuse me ma’am, I get regular oil changes on my car!!!
2585 2018-09-20 19:03:33 Veda and I just used a Furze bath oil and I LOVE how it smells. Not sure how I feel about all these tiny flower petals though @lushcosmetics
2586 2018-09-20 19:03:10 agents are like snake oil salesmen, comes down to how much you want to give them. he hasn't lived up to his end of the bargain for sure but just a really bad fit overall and unlucky
2587 2018-09-20 19:03:04 BOTH PARTIES HAVE FAILED TO WORK THIS OUT AND GET CONTROL OF PRICES OF CRUDE OIL. BIG OIL MAKES MILLIONS AND WE LOSE OUT BECAUSE WE ARE SO DEPENDENT ON OIL 
HOPE YOU READ THE BOOKS IF YOU LIKE ECONOMICS THEY ARE A GOOD READ.
2588 2018-09-20 19:02:56 I didn't even get to try my new oil carts 
2589 2018-09-20 19:02:54 I take Mega Red Krill Oil!
2590 2018-09-20 19:02:37 Covered in oil and already messed up the washer lol
2591 2018-09-20 19:02:33 Asking whether I sold essential oil or motor oil is neither clever or original, it’s just insulting.
2592 2018-09-20 19:02:31 Clever blacks cellphone records are very clear 
That is why all those E-mail  were rejected at the inquiry  because they were not authentic

2594 2018-09-20 19:02:11 Tea tree oil but dilute it with water before applying. 

It worked wonders on my nipple piercings and hip piercings.
2595 2018-09-20 19:02:11 Been using peppermint oil for the  beard , keeps it fresh and shining
2596 2018-09-20 19:02:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jesse
2597 2018-09-20 19:01:45 Use coconut oil
2598 2018-09-20 19:01:41 U.S. oil futures settle lower as Trump pressures OPEC to lower prices
2599 2018-09-20 19:01:28 It worked? My legs are very light skinned and clear but my face is way darker(has always been)& I use only body oil. It's better now and I don't use anything again.
2600 2018-09-20 19:01:27 Strange. Russia would welcome high oil prices.
2601 2018-09-20 19:01:12 I miss my oil equity puts paydays of 2014-15 this is too different! Good show
2602 2018-09-20 19:01:08 You know Hollywood would change them to rich white oil CEOs.
2603 2018-09-20 19:00:55 Jamaican black castor oil
2604 2018-09-20 19:00:51 Like every Gov you sell Gilts and with a projected Indy Scotland's credit rating amongst ALL the major Int Credit Ref agencies the highest triple A  this will not be an obstacle in stark contrast to the current UK AA+ rating. So I think  £100 trillion + Gilts based on Oil is OK
2605 2018-09-20 19:00:36 Another vote for oil here but I like to heat the oil then remove the pan from the heat once I’ve added the egg  so it cooks gently in the hot oil and doesn’t get all grizzly

2609 2018-09-20 19:00:25 .. So now oil and gas is so important? I beg to differ, mine worked with Emirates .. The most important thing here is that the baby mama should go grab a life, the guy doesn't wanna help her? She should get in line.. No be force
2610 2018-09-20 19:00:22 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2611 2018-09-20 19:00:20 OUR OWN OIL CORPS . ARE SELLING ALMOST 100% OF WHAT THEY PRODUCE TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA + OTHERS . WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE BACK OUR LAWS REGARDING THE EXPORT OF OIL . THESE OIL CORPS ONLY CARE ABOUT PROFIT NOT THE USA NEEDS .
2612 2018-09-20 19:00:11 I mean, I think there would be destroyers in the Gulf of Aden whether oil was passing through it or not.
2613 2018-09-20 19:00:08 There must be health benefits because a lot of people are taking fish oil pills now 
2614 2018-09-20 18:59:54 It is supply and demand,when you push Iran's sanction button,it means less supply of oil
2615 2018-09-20 18:59:45 @ oil in the frying pan
you're being unnecessarily snappy at me, pls behave
2616 2018-09-20 18:59:39 International oil market के बारे में बताए थोड़ा?
2617 2018-09-20 18:59:38 I see this line of reasoning, but maintaining sea lanes for free and peaceful shipping of *all* goods is a major mission of the US Navy. How much does this priority overlap with securing those lanes for oil?
2618 2018-09-20 18:59:37 Why not get the Armor Oil and shine up the ‘Stang?
2619 2018-09-20 18:59:25 What do you want to use castor oil for, though? 

If you're constipated and needing to release then rather try Movicol satchets. You cam get them at pharmacies or Dischem/Clicks. My gynae prescribed these to me during my pregnancy and they helped a lot.
2620 2018-09-20 18:59:21 I think they’re doing this to get murkowski & Collins to waver
2621 2018-09-20 18:59:18 I just got stood down for testing positive for CBD Oil. I’m trying my best not to snap, I’m at peak level. Maybe God got another plan he never talk back to me so I don’t know.
2622 2018-09-20 18:59:12 when i was younger i took a summer course where we painted woth water soluble fake oil paints i wish i could fond them again that was supwr fun to paint woth
2623 2018-09-20 18:59:10 It varies from car to car considering manufactures engine size and so on, but originally in the 60s & 70s the 3-5 thousand mile oil change was a scam made by lube shops to keep their customers returning
2624 2018-09-20 18:59:09 How many of @SecretaryZinke's oil and natural resources private industry buddies will going with him? 
2625 2018-09-20 18:58:53 Hanging around Vivint today to get my essential oil fix for the next 3 years.
2626 2018-09-20 18:58:51 Why don’t you bring our soldiers home and stop protecting oil and let them protect is here in the US. You privileged white piece of shit!
2627 2018-09-20 18:58:47 if youre into essential oils (which are amazing by the way) there are a bunch to help with suppressing your appetite and weight loss! Grapefruit oil is my favorite 
2628 2018-09-20 18:58:41 The corruption in our oil sector. Benn there from time immemorial, still there and no end in sight
2629 2018-09-20 18:58:40 One does get the idea DJT thinks one should always come away with some prize, even ill gotten  i.e. oil in ME war, minerals in Syria, someone elses boat in hurricane loss of home, money from NAFTA. This man is about greed, no integrity or compassion.
2630 2018-09-20 18:58:22 Oil and gas represent a whopping 60% of Russia's GDP and an even larger  percentage of Moscow's federal budget revenues. Keeping global oil  prices low is a way of keeping Putin in check; something Trump's  advisers have reminded him of on a regular basis this year.
2631 2018-09-20 18:58:04 Send the oil to Texas we will gladly take it. The one billion dollar surplus we will take that to.
2632 2018-09-20 18:58:03 I’ve been using almond oil to clear my acne and I feel like That’s what’s causing it
2633 2018-09-20 18:58:00 just got some rosehip oil. ready for it to change my lyfe
2634 2018-09-20 18:57:35 Why being an adult so expensive?? Just spent $290 on two tires and a oil change 
2635 2018-09-20 18:57:30 The US failed to 'protect' the secular nation of Syria.
Is there not enough oil there ??
2636 2018-09-20 18:57:22 Under NAFTA, 75 percent of all oil produced and imported in Canada and 50 percent of gas needs to be exported to the U.S.  Ending NAFTA would end this requirement and cause oil prices to rise further.
2637 2018-09-20 18:57:21 I want to do my oil change but I don’t even have the tools anymore 
2638 2018-09-20 18:57:16 Highlighting the uselessness of the Cameron to communicate to ordinary people and Corbyn's reluctance to offer an alternative vision to improve opportunities within the EU. 
Then you had the disingenuous with the man of the people act doing a snake oil sales schtick.

2640 2018-09-20 18:57:02 Scottish oil driller KCA Deutag weighing options including an IPO of the firm..scoop/w @RuthsDavid on terminal
2641 2018-09-20 18:56:51 One thing you missed was the basic supply-demand curve for oil. Prices need to be in this range to induce enough drilling to satisfy current and exepected future demand.

But let’s not waste our time trying to explain this to Cheeto. Unless you want to piss him off for sport.
2642 2018-09-20 18:56:43 Oregano Essential Oil is a vile experience!

I take it by putting 4 drops in a clear plastic capsule.

Not bad that way.
2643 2018-09-20 18:56:43 Where the GOP went wrong.
The Republican Party represented American business and the American
businessman.
This GOP represents the International Business community....their International Oligarchs, their Saudi Sunni Arabs and the Oil Cartel.
We fought that war in 1776 !
2644 2018-09-20 18:56:02 What are you suggesting here? That heavy blended crude should be traded at the same price as Medium/Sweet crude. Either you don’t know how oil is refined (unlikely) or you are being willfully ignorant to push “nationalists” into frenzy. Either way it’s sad.
2645 2018-09-20 18:56:01 Buys our weapons. Sells oil for US$. Waging war for profit.
2646 2018-09-20 18:55:52 Finally got my oil changed after being 4000 miles over due. Guy told me all my fluids look excellent and my car is being taken care of very nicely

2650 2018-09-20 18:55:39 Where is our oil?
2651 2018-09-20 18:55:38 Yeah and the funniest part was my little brother who’s studying to be a mechanic was looking at me like I was stupid and even said “gay people only know one type of engine oil don’t they” dkanvzjskss.

2655 2018-09-20 18:54:58 #NextCalifornia governor should address the oil & gas extraction and processing in CA. Real leadership = no new oil and gas permits, a 2500 ft. health & safety buffer, and a phase out of fossil fuels.

2660 2018-09-20 18:54:48 You can try some argan oil for the ends (use sparingly). Believe it or not using it with a flatiron actually helps the ends. Overall you’ve quite lovely hair!

2663 2018-09-20 18:54:37 9/11 was a false flag operation that paved the way for the invasion of iraq, not for their oil but in order to destroy ancient relics that prove humans were created by aliens
2664 2018-09-20 18:54:34 Wether YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, we will keep pushing for higher oil prices and you will keep asking for more and u’ll keep protecting us.

2668 2018-09-20 18:54:04 I worked in the Gulf of Mexico oil fields with a very knowledgeable position,  it's unbelievable the amount oil we sit on, reserves, we do not use any of the USA's, and the TrumpTard, has know knowledge of the US'S oil production,  he thinks he has money , ba, ha ha  !
2669 2018-09-20 18:54:01 He might regret offering @williamcrawley that interview, the oil 'deals' offer is bound to come up.
2670 2018-09-20 18:53:57 19% of oil imported. 
33 % of total imports from OPEC. 
OPEC has many competitors. 
You don't know what a monopoly is.

That could be taken 2 ways!
By the way, will I need an Imperial or Metric spanner?
2681 2018-09-20 18:52:50 Or create millions of jobs in a green new deal that would make oil obsolete

2706 2018-09-20 18:50:30 Three years ago the NEB learned of hundreds of faulty pipelines parts that “expand or break under pressure”. 

There’s almost 1,000,000 km of oil pipelines across Canada passing through virtually every town and city.

2708 2018-09-20 18:50:14 I loathe the smell of eucalyptus bc someone told me once that if you sprinkle drops of it’s essential oil on your bed, bugs will leave you alone and so I put that shit all over my body and poisoned tf out of myself.
2709 2018-09-20 18:50:06 My latest chicken craze is dipped in eggs, covered in flour/Cajun voices and then fried with some olive oil. So good.

2722 2018-09-20 18:48:00 I’ve always thought it would just be good business for oil companies too diversify into renewables.
2723 2018-09-20 18:47:47 @WhiteHouse High Oil Prices. Do This. It's Is Logical Accounting.

2725 2018-09-20 18:47:43 If only @SecretaryZinke @RyanZinke was more concerned with the actual maintenance and conservation of our National Parks and less concerned with selling our park lands to his oil and gas industry "friends."
2726 2018-09-20 18:47:38 Exactly, government does not work for the oil and gas industry, which is something you seem to not understand...

2733 2018-09-20 18:47:04 @WhiteHouse Think Of It This Way. Oil Reserves Are Assets In The Ground. High Value Assets Are Creators Of Economic Growth And Money.

2746 2018-09-20 18:46:19 Oil and water don't mix
2747 2018-09-20 18:46:07 Too true.The documents would probably reveal they knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq (like most everyone else knew) but that they went in to get their oil.  Thousands of deaths so Cheney could get richer.We'd learn Dubya is a war criminal.
2748 2018-09-20 18:46:07 man I don’t care if not everyone’s Foodwoke Vegan Palm Oil Avoider Never Touched Meat In The Past 6 Years but one thing I despise is when people leave/waste a whole serving of meat... an animal really died for you to just waste it lmao

2761 2018-09-20 18:44:33 I feel sorry for Mrs May. She believed in remain but decided to bat for leave. Tried to cobble something together, which, in the end, pleased no one.

The ones that I don’t feel sorry for, however, are the ones that got us into this mess to begin with. The ones selling snake oil
2762 2018-09-20 18:44:31 you should defs get an acid toner imo - superdrug do an inexpensive one that i really like. proper flannel (oil/balm) cleanse and acid tone should be enough!
2763 2018-09-20 18:44:24 That oil change outta pocket 
2764 2018-09-20 18:44:09 Crude Oil prices of more than $70 per barrel will do no one any good, both the buyer and the seller.
2765 2018-09-20 18:44:08 And Oil exploration as well in Baluchistan...
2766 2018-09-20 18:44:04 @canada_welcome Welcome to Canada if your are rich (Like George Soros or the Aga Khan, Justin Trudeau) or if you own an oil well in the North Sea, not if you like Jihad or Sharia. Bring your AK-47 and leave it on the plane along with the C4. Thank you.
2767 2018-09-20 18:44:02 Alcohol companies are the biggest force that is keeping their product available cheap and cannabis products still illegal. Except for cbd oil which is priced very expensively.
2768 2018-09-20 18:44:00 Puerto Rico has the right to mandate the direction of their countries future. Though undet the umbrella of the U S,  Puerto Rico is a Territory, NOT A State.
Theyve been abandoned except for PR Tours.
Trump & Big Oil Cronies cant have it both ways.
2769 2018-09-20 18:43:59 My grandpa was pretty upset when I learned how to change my own oil. His reason? “Well crap des. Now your man is gonna ask you to do it!” 
2770 2018-09-20 18:43:54 @CineFixNetwork you guys should do a what’s the difference between “Oil!” and “There Will Be Blood”
2771 2018-09-20 18:43:52 #Emirates seeks takeover of #Etihad as the latter is struggling to hold its ground due to nepotism, bad investments such as AlItalia & bad hedging strategies such as buying oil before hand a few years ago when prices were high. If they dont change 
 course; finished in 24 months.
2772 2018-09-20 18:43:45 They use the most oil countries in Brics with higher oil price account deficit increased as the Asian economy is interconnected and china is a huge part of it as china us tarrif hit all emerging markets saw outflow of capital causing depreciation in currency

2774 2018-09-20 18:43:37 Discovered something awesome today.

Fried sweet peppers.

Tried some Italian sweet peppers and the Japanese shishito pepper, sauteed in olive oil, with a little kosher salt on top.

Yum.
2775 2018-09-20 18:43:31 I miss Italian food on the east coast  i just want some penne with garlic and oil man
2776 2018-09-20 18:43:23 .,babyyyy, it’s gonna change the game ! I only know how to make the gel  need to learn how to make oil from it !
2777 2018-09-20 18:43:14 Has anybody got a decent supply of lavander oil or fabreze?
2778 2018-09-20 18:43:13 Clearly a blame transferring play. He likes to take credit for things that are going well (stock market), and blame transfer when things aren’t going well (oil), irrespective of his actual influence. It also sets him up to take credit if WTI prices go down.
2779 2018-09-20 18:42:57 I think a toy car, a burgundy oil bottle and Pascal could make the mother of all ferrets. MAYBE!! Must add to my notes.
2780 2018-09-20 18:42:50 Drink lots of water. It naturally moisturizes the skin. When you don't, your skin will be dry and your body produces oil to moisturize itself. Most of the time, you have oily skin because you don't moisturize enough, not because you do so too much.
2781 2018-09-20 18:42:43 My car told me an oil change is REQUIRED like don’t tell me what to do
2782 2018-09-20 18:42:40 How much do you know about the #oil and #gas sector in @uganda?

2784 2018-09-20 18:42:32 Its more like our government many who have 6 figure investments in big oil want the prices up...its always a surprize that no matter where there is a problem all of a sudden thats where 50% of our oul comes from.
2785 2018-09-20 18:42:30 America should protect it's business interests established in Cameroon , WE get most of the oil from Sonora plant in Limbe . It will go elsewhere if we don't stop the genocides and kick the Chinese and Russians out .
2786 2018-09-20 18:42:29 @narendramodi Hello
To reduce current account deficit and stop Rupee slide, Can we start Barter system with Oil rich nation.
For example if we are importing Oil from Iraq instead of paying in USD, we should offer our products. This will help us to increase our Export.
2787 2018-09-20 18:42:25 I think you “protect” them precisely because of oil - you would leave them to chaos if they didn’t have oil.
I seem to recall someone doubling golf memberships recently - that’s how free markets work
2788 2018-09-20 18:42:21 Media hounds were looking forward to see the PM coming back with a bailout package from the Saudies or some free oil. Nothing of that sort happened. PM comes back with a promise of $10 Billion investment into CPEC projects. #NayaPakistan

2793 2018-09-20 18:41:55 We should have taken control of the oil in Iraq after we smashed them. Nobody should have given money to Iran and we shouldn't have sent aide to refugees. We shouldn't be providing security for many of the back stabbing countries we protect
2794 2018-09-20 18:41:54 searching for hot oil at purgatory. pffft! 
2795 2018-09-20 18:41:45 We get a say? Cause Canadians want renewables, so I doubt that. Also, we already subsidize oil massively, now we're paying for their pollution, so double subsidized. Now the slight claw back of feed in tariffs is gone. Socialism for stupid project, seems to be this party's motto.
2796 2018-09-20 18:41:41 The government is hiding bigfoot from us. If bigfoot was discovered they would be an endangered species and more forests would be protected. They're hiding bigfoot from us so they can deforest our great lands for oil pipelines, tar sands and Amazon fulfillment centers
2797 2018-09-20 18:41:39 Why coconut oil though it's super expensive...
2798 2018-09-20 18:41:36 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2799 2018-09-20 18:41:36 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2803 2018-09-20 18:41:22 The US isn't "protecting the world's oil supply". It's mostly focused on Israel's needs. Iraq invasion wasnt about oil. @leslietron @El_Spy
2804 2018-09-20 18:41:12 The profit from the us oil refiners is also very high. Billions each quarter? Obscene.
2805 2018-09-20 18:41:08 Students should be taught many different views. It’s not politics. Do you really think teachers never mention that Oil and Gas makes lots of money and creates jobs? However, it also has negative effects on the environment. Fact.

2816 2018-09-20 18:40:16 I’ve needed an oil change. Since March.

2818 2018-09-20 18:40:04 Sounds great, going to try mine flaked on a slice of @BellsofLazonby bread, drizzled with olive oil and topped of with poached eggs 
2819 2018-09-20 18:40:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
2820 2018-09-20 18:40:02 You just toss like 4 things into a food processor and that's it, right? Like olive oil, basil, garlic and salt or something. Oh and those tiny nuts/seeds
2821 2018-09-20 18:39:36 Hey @uwinnipeg and @UWDeptKIN students! There's now more room available in "Sport in the Ancient Greek World" this winter (CLAS/KIN-2061; TT 4:00-5:15PM). Learn about the ancient Olympics, female athletes, discus, pankration, and the many uses of olive oil!
2822 2018-09-20 18:39:26 So lets stop protecting them. Why are we exporting oil while simultaneously buying it from them? Let them do thier own thing. Oh, right, the petrodollar. If they start trading oil in non-US currency our whole house of cards falls down.
2823 2018-09-20 18:39:20 You have really drunk the Big Oil kool-aid. I think we're done here. #ByeFelicia
2824 2018-09-20 18:39:05 If oil price falls again ..
State of Osun will not be the only state affected . all the 36 state of federation will be affected.
every oil producing country depend mainly on it for survival.
there is nothing any state governor can do replace oil. don't allow anybody to fool u.

2826 2018-09-20 18:38:52 I love the way tea tree oil smells
2827 2018-09-20 18:38:37 Oil is doing fine.  Companies that operated with a specific understood cost of supply such as steel are not.
2828 2018-09-20 18:38:37 This girl said she was looking for an oil change technician... If you don't just go to Valvoline, instead of trusting a stranger for something so common.
2829 2018-09-20 18:38:28 That makes soooooooo much more sense. I thought you were saying he was trash like CBD oil and i was kinda um? What? Hahahaha
2830 2018-09-20 18:38:27 Wait... Kavanaugh, DACA, the declassified documents and the toad stool are not the top story?
2831 2018-09-20 18:38:21 Oil. Plaster yourself in oil preferably baby let it sit for a while but more baby oil shower and scrub comes right off
2832 2018-09-20 18:38:19 LIQUI MOLY partners with the @ChicagoBulls. The German oil manufacturer will have a significant presence at the @UnitedCenter, as well as on  Bulls’ digital platforms.

2834 2018-09-20 18:38:12 I needa get my oil change tomorrow cause i keep putting it off & weeks Turn into months
2835 2018-09-20 18:38:12 Germany meets 95% of their daily electricy needs via solar and wind power, America need to get its shit together and move in that direction, unfortunately America will be the leading oil producer in the world by 2020, that doesn't bode well for alternative energy sources
2836 2018-09-20 18:38:08 It's better to strangle the trump consultants, or go to the White House alongside the Jewish masters. Iran's oil exports will not be cut off by November, you will pay a very terrible price
2837 2018-09-20 18:37:50 Corporations are not people. The Department of the Interior is about protecting federal land. Oil and gas companies don't care about people or the protection of land.

2848 2018-09-20 18:37:07 That's dumb. The design on the flyer  is incredibly interesting and has so much motion. Plus talking trash on him for shutter stock images is basically equivalent to talking trash on Van Gogh for using oil paints lol
2849 2018-09-20 18:36:57 And the price of just about everything is about to go up thanks to Dump's tariffs. The last time they went up when oil prices soared, it was a huge hit. My budget is about to become very, very tight. And I'm a lucky one.

2853 2018-09-20 18:36:30 stuff like soft serve ice cream and nacho cheese are made with "edible oil" derivatives, which are basically whatever long hydrocarbon polymers happen to not be toxic for one reason of another

2876 2018-09-20 18:34:28 What is this oil?
2877 2018-09-20 18:34:27 More nonsense! The OPEC isn’t driving up the price! Venture capitalists in the US who buy up all the oil when it comes ashore, and control the supply ... those are the guys who drive up the price! Billionaires, greedy people ... like you!

2895 2018-09-20 18:32:45 It’s hard to believe a country with the resources of Canada relies on foreign oil and can’t even build a pipeline to tide water simply unreal

2901 2018-09-20 18:32:02 As for oil, I say F the Middle East! Thousands of American lives have been sacrificed there and Trillions of dollars spent. They can drink their damn oil as far as I’m concerned!
2902 2018-09-20 18:32:00 If Iran exports oil in November, it would be a big betrayal for Iran's free-riders and a new round of killings in the Middle East. People of America Beware that Trump wants to betray, US values ​​do not allow terrorism to be sponsored

2943 2018-09-20 18:28:10 You need to get whatever oil you are using really smoking hot. I then use a brush to oil the sides. When the batter goes in it should sizzle and come up the sides. That’s what makes it all crispy

2949 2018-09-20 18:27:33 Good gesture but such inaccessible areas were not supposed existing again in Nigeria. I wonder where goes oil money over these years?
2950 2018-09-20 18:27:27 Sometimes your face will produce more oil to make up for the lack thereof. (Could be stripping it by using aggressive products) It’s all about balancing. Hyaluronic acid, light moisturizer, AHA.

2954 2018-09-20 18:27:17 I've heard more about this in the last few hours than any of the umpteen records we broke last season. Might as well throw in dirty oil money just in case anybody wondered which club they were talking about.
2955 2018-09-20 18:27:10 @prosehair I started using this hair care two weeks ago. The mask totally is balancing out my oil production, my hair which is thin is lighter/better texture and most importantly my hair has stopped falling out. Thank you!
2956 2018-09-20 18:27:08 Pure propaganda by president, not truth, but nice play. Higher oil can help our economy with higher paying jobs. Oh it hurts California, . But even more important is it settled down Putin after downed A/C and we may get a geopolitical win/ concessions from Putin. Imo anyway.
2957 2018-09-20 18:27:03 I would like you to discuss the oil coming in to eastern Canada from Saudi Arabia and their human rights issues , as opposed to oil coming from the west
2958 2018-09-20 18:26:55 I never knew I ate an omelette in such exalted company and appreciate the tip on the oil. I shall from now on engage the '30 second rule'. Never cooked pancakes, taking one step at a time.

2960 2018-09-20 18:26:49 U must be aware how money is routed via b'desh to hedge the currency n vice versa
This info I got from a family friend, so can't promise the actuals
Bt heard from him dat a lot of Paki currency is being floated there and routed to various oil based countries from there
2961 2018-09-20 18:26:46 Maybe refineries can be built in Alberta and Saskatchewan, since no tarsands oil will ever be used by Canadians except for the small bit of stuff currently refined in Alberta. Then the resource will benefit Canadians instead of a few oil companies.
2962 2018-09-20 18:26:33 Why not use coconut oil to moisturize it?

2973 2018-09-20 18:25:56 Chinese dumping. Not once.

The death of Solyndra was murder by Republicans. The GOP is 100% owned by the oil industry, who will continue to murder the innovation you support in its crib.

The time has come to murder the anti-American oil industry. The start is to end the GOP.end
2974 2018-09-20 18:25:47 So they’re issuing a bullshit medal to a clown in order to look “woke”. Sounds pretty much par for the course for a college/university.
2975 2018-09-20 18:25:42 One reason why oil prices are high is because YOU, #DOTUS unilaterally  imposed sanctions on Iran, reducing their output by 1 million barrels  per day! As for OPEC being a “monopoly,” the U.S. is now the world’s largest  oil producer. You cretin. Any more B.S. for us, Donnie?
2976 2018-09-20 18:25:31 I don’t keep the company of anyone who would allow me 2 confide in them my sin.All my friends would be getting they blessed oil out mid sentence.When we confess our faults one to another,the scripture says that brings about healing!Its not just what u have,but who u have around u

2978 2018-09-20 18:25:18 It would be perilous mining or fracking under/near Yellowestone. It sits on a huge ancient volcano. Wd be somewhat ironic if an oil and gas company was responsible for the explosion of North America. Probably an extinction event.

2989 2018-09-20 18:23:52 Also, trying to put 2-3 drops of oil on your skin is hard af, you need more than that to not just make tiny oily patches, but the full dropper is far, far too much product for just a face.
2990 2018-09-20 18:23:51 Why women under 35 never take they car in for an oil change? Lol literally all u gotta do is pull up for 10 mins

Always 1 brick shy of a full pallet.
2992 2018-09-20 18:23:50 Yeah, A stadium we pay for every day in our sales tax. A stadium I'll never see! Big Oil subsidies are around $9 billion to 20 billion a year. They also get tax breaks, etc. Coal is included in that number

2995 2018-09-20 18:23:36 Bagging on essential oil distribution through MLMs: good because its a health hazard and unethical

The aspect of pride and trendiness of said bagging on essential oils: yeah, annoying.
2996 2018-09-20 18:23:32 Thank You!  each is allowed to have a opinion! I see a President that loves this country donates his check, the stock market has hit record highs, got rid of ISIS ( that Obama) said cant be done! Has brought back jobs to our country, we are leading the world in oil, tax cuts!
2997 2018-09-20 18:23:28 I don't remember your Texan pals, the oil barons complaining about high oil prices when they were the beneficiaries. Slap a tarrif on it, make it even more expensive like you're doing with everything else!

3011 2018-09-20 18:21:52 The US counts Oil from Canada as part of their reserves and production. Always have and alwsys will. That is why big oil is paying US environmental groups to protest any development that may get Canadian oil to tidewater and foreign markets. Look up Tide Foundation

3020 2018-09-20 18:20:49 It's actually pretty easy to transition away from coal and gas with the wind + solar +storage options available now. Add in EVs and it's getting easier to transition away from oil too.
3021 2018-09-20 18:20:48 You have public, solid and overwhelming evidence of the GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas and have done NOTHING!. From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE, conduct REFERENDUM, it is the right thing to do.

3025 2018-09-20 18:20:05 the oil change is for my dad’s car bc my car’s brakes are grinding a lot.. do u mind fixing that too? thanks in advance
3026 2018-09-20 18:20:05 No surprise here. Senate Republicans and doing the right thing are the new oil and water.
3027 2018-09-20 18:20:01 Your #ChooseFun #cruise ships are no laughing matter for the #climate! Stop burning ultra-dirty heavy fuel oil! #CleanUpCarnival. @Aida_De @MickyArison @PrincessCruises @Oashford @pandocruises @HALcruises @CarnivalCruise @CarnivalPLC
3028 2018-09-20 18:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3029 2018-09-20 18:19:47 Oil fields? 
3030 2018-09-20 18:19:41 And we already know how inept and useless you are at that. What’s your point. You had 10 years and did NOTHING to get oil to tidewater
3031 2018-09-20 18:19:39 The Middle East is safe? Okaaaaay. Delusional. How about we learn to develop other sustainable sources of power and reduce reliance on oil?
3032 2018-09-20 18:19:34 Carter V, Neymar getting washed and Oil teams catching L's all in a week. Good lord
3033 2018-09-20 18:19:26 Go in for an oil change and when they come back you need a whole new car
3034 2018-09-20 18:19:23 ‘Cases of oil paint are good things to drop’- people who don’t know any better.
3035 2018-09-20 18:19:20 On the bus unfortunately & there's this girl behind me sucking on an oil pen.blowing it into the back of head. Like can we get any ruder..
3036 2018-09-20 18:19:14 Olive oil is the best for deep conditioning.
3037 2018-09-20 18:19:12 it seems insane to me to smuggle massive oil tankers to foreign ports and get the money, all the while evading sanctions and basically the swift banking network
3038 2018-09-20 18:19:08 Has anyone used castor oil? If so, thoughts?

3040 2018-09-20 18:18:55 Well, the GOP is working for the oil and gas industry, too, isn't it?
3041 2018-09-20 18:18:49 I also have problems with the VA. Tried today to get omega 3 fish oil refilled for my cholesterol and it expired and the VA told me that I would have to make yet another appointment to see the PCP in order to get this refilled. I was just in this past May 2018 for my reg. checkup
3042 2018-09-20 18:18:35 Ma'm is that "elevated " or "deliberately inflated" crude oil prices by contacts of Congi?
3043 2018-09-20 18:18:35 When I boiled it dry. And the oil leak made the engine seize. Basically it was murdered.
3044 2018-09-20 18:18:23 The U.S.A produces more oil than any other country in the world 
Politicians just let them export it.
$HCLP
@realDonaldTrump
3045 2018-09-20 18:18:22 When barrel price was high earlier means international cost of crude oil is more so final cost of petrol etc should be more but it was comparitvely low. Now barrel price is low means international cost is low so overall price should be low but it's high due to heavy load taxes.
3046 2018-09-20 18:18:14 oh not small amounts of oil, but rather oil smuggling on DPRK levels
3047 2018-09-20 18:18:13 My car goes through quite a bit of oil so I tend to check it often and EVERY SINGLE TIME I do it in a public setting someone comes over “ are you okay?!” Bitch you see I have a rag and bottle of oil if you don’t know what I’m doing you weren’t gonna be much help anyways
3048 2018-09-20 18:18:12 leo & geminis - oil & water looool. you are my twin flameeee
3049 2018-09-20 18:18:10 Il fallait bien que je change un jour Sob
3050 2018-09-20 18:18:10 The whole idea is to keep oil prices high enough to keep the profits flowing, but not so high to hurt sales of full-size pickup trucks.
3051 2018-09-20 18:18:02 Do you use beard oil now?
3052 2018-09-20 18:18:01 Oh Saudi n Qatari kids don't eat oil do they, I would rather be the two than in Venezuela
3053 2018-09-20 18:17:59 He’s done it before with his stand on oil sand and his carbon tax.
3054 2018-09-20 18:17:50 an ultrasound tech hesitantly suggested, "i know most doctors don't bring up holistic remedies, but have you tried evening primrose oil?" like, honey-- i would walk right into a graveyard and scoop mounds of hot corpse dirt into my armpit if i thought it would help-- i'm D O W N
3055 2018-09-20 18:17:43 Granola cakes. Basic recipe is 3 eggs, 1/3 c vegetable oil, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, beaten together for 2 min (I never actually go this long). Stir in 3 c quick oats and 3/4 c raisins if you like them. Spoon into muffin tins and bake at 350 for at least 20 minutes. Makes 12.
3056 2018-09-20 18:17:42 #BUILDTHATWALL 
Just ridiculous we are having this problem more than 30 years after mass amnesty and several lesser amnesties since. 
Pre Obama dems were anti illegal, what changed. Not the FACTS
3057 2018-09-20 18:17:41 girl just came in asking if they could change her oil because she thought she could only take it to the dealership lmao
3058 2018-09-20 18:17:31 May’s toast, so is the Tory Party, so is Brexit and so, most likely, is the Country. Well done, Cameron, Johnson, Gove, Farage, Corbyn & the rest of the crooks & spivs and snake oil merchants.
3059 2018-09-20 18:17:30 Bhai @muglikar_ read somewhere that india will pay oil bills to iran in rupees.Does it have anything to do with the petrol and diesel prices.
3060 2018-09-20 18:17:15 Hey CBD Oil Info Place(@cbdoilinfo), thank you for following me
3061 2018-09-20 18:17:14 Info even with out the pipeline oil production is expected to rise again and it will be shipped by Rail. Through a town near you. Now if the price difference is available it would pay for the pipeline in 1-2 years.
3062 2018-09-20 18:17:12 shut up before I find out where you stay and act like I found some oil nigga
3063 2018-09-20 18:17:11 Bro it's illegal to sell pure thc oil in states where weed is not legalized, that cbn bullshit can be sold anywhere...
3064 2018-09-20 18:17:10 But the ultimate solution is not natural gas, it is alternative energy. I'm seeing more and more solar panel farms and more and more windmills. Sooner or later it will hit critical mass and we can reduce our dependence on oil. It requires long-term thinking and planning.
3065 2018-09-20 18:17:01 Baby oil the roof - that’ll foil their scatological malevolence   Bushy tailed fuckers. X
3066 2018-09-20 18:17:01 Uber, but for oil consumption.
3067 2018-09-20 18:16:47 Reliance ..mukesh ambani . Old fashion idea of oil with new fashion idea of jio ...
3068 2018-09-20 18:16:44 I’ve never heard of anybody “vaping weed”   y’all need some Jesus and CBD oil.
3069 2018-09-20 18:16:44 A cat near us fell into the waste oil container at a local garage. It made a full recovery, but definitely needed cleaning.
3070 2018-09-20 18:16:40 Who can help Us? 
Do you think we can start working without this money?
Nowadays we buy oil from another country...
No reserve

3073 2018-09-20 18:16:25 I’ve got one of the spider catchers, but only really work on the small false widow types.
I can’t stand them.

Last night, poured this old hand wash down the sink it had peppermint oil in it.
There’s a F w just above the window.
Never seen it move so quick. It was outta there. 
3074 2018-09-20 18:16:24 Should have used CBD oil, it actually does work, for autism anyway, my autism anyway.  Also according to Forbes, it's TRIPLING cancer survival rates along with chemo.  Cannabinoids are not only in hemp or cannabis, they are in hops also.  It's about our endocannabinoid system.
3075 2018-09-20 18:16:21 Aww I dont get to eat lunch with daddy. .  Oh well .   These nails and that oil change needed to be doneee

3078 2018-09-20 18:16:13 4 cigars a year? Please, try working around the oil fields and gasoline plants. Come on 4 to 5 good cigars a year is nothing.
3079 2018-09-20 18:16:13 i use coconut oil religiously
3080 2018-09-20 18:15:50 Okay...so you should know...supply and demand works like this. There is a correlation between the supply/demand of oil and the price. The supply is decreasing. The demand is decreasing. Many are going to more sustainable and clean energy...plus there is also inflation...it’s alot
3081 2018-09-20 18:15:46 Blend 9 tsps jelly / jam with 1/3 cup kidney beans. Mix into  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve with love.
3082 2018-09-20 18:15:44 China working on developing it's own technologies so not to

Wow...no more oil....no more export/import....Looks like
Sir Trump will have nothing to do at the White House but drink Kovfefe..
3083 2018-09-20 18:15:42 Think of it as an oil change for your colon.
3084 2018-09-20 18:15:42 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
3085 2018-09-20 18:15:34 Consumption methods of cannabis include:

3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis

3090 2018-09-20 18:15:01 You supporting Nader over Gore is what led to the Iraq war. You labeled a future Nobel peace prize winner on climate change the same as a bumbling texas oil tycoon. 

I don't understand you or Michael  Moore.
3091 2018-09-20 18:14:48 Yep...change the oil!

3095 2018-09-20 18:14:25 AND avocado oil 
3096 2018-09-20 18:14:20 Yes, government should function for the benefit of all, be it an oil executive or a single mother on welfare, a LNG company or the NAACP.  Or are you advocating that we dump  the 4th and 5th amendments?  Because it sure sounds like it to me.
3097 2018-09-20 18:14:16 Honey nd olive oil
3098 2018-09-20 18:13:57 Ah, but BC has an abundance of non-emitting hydro-electricity which produces about 90% of its power, and in some parts of the province, a more moderate climate, while Nova Scotia still relies to a large extent on coal, pet coke, natural gas, and oil for power generation.
3099 2018-09-20 18:13:54 Terry Dicken said future developments in industrial lube include increased use of Group II base oil in formulations and more demand for filled for life applications at this @ICISOfficial's N.A. Industrial Lubricants Congress. #ICISChemical @ICISChemicals
3100 2018-09-20 18:13:40 How much is big oil subsidized?? The same as the Twins and Vikings stadiums??  If you wanna talk subsidies instead of gas tax...
3101 2018-09-20 18:13:28 Watch the documentary The Corporation. It interviews CEOs of oil companies bewailing the threat of climate change in private while they carry on destroying the planet in their corporate lives. *That's* what I'm talking about
3102 2018-09-20 18:13:28 Huddart Nose 2 - After the oil comes a lightly smoked meatt note, salmon? Ham? A slight piney quality in there too #MaritimeMalt
3103 2018-09-20 18:13:13 Added chicken with the pasta in a lovely homemade creamy mushroom sauce sat on a bed of greens with half a garlic baguette. Sauteed the potatoes with parsley & oregano in a olive oil    What did you have?
3104 2018-09-20 18:13:06 Ur language shows ur upbringing. Sickular check ur facts out of 2 lakh crore oil bond in Modi’s regime only one instalment of approx 3000cr was due.. that is paid and next instalment will be due in 2022.Modi govt had made 1100000 cr by taking tax on petrol from common man.
3105 2018-09-20 18:13:02 And I’m copping beard oil! I’m on different kind of time this winter 
3106 2018-09-20 18:12:50 CBD, hemp oil (thc) is only sold in legalized states...
3107 2018-09-20 18:12:44 Literally two hits of this oil and I’m choking, happens every time.
3108 2018-09-20 18:12:40 Took Conor’s car to get an oil change and the guy I had an appointment with lived and graduated from Catoosa. Small world.
3109 2018-09-20 18:12:37 She's a politician; she wouldn't know what an innocent person would do.
3110 2018-09-20 18:12:30 But, the kids cannot eat oil!

Comparative advantage, is the basis of trade. Are you this daft?
3111 2018-09-20 18:12:22 Pull out. We will use American oil.

3122 2018-09-20 18:11:46 Saudi arab is about to make an oil city in pakistan  near gawadar !!
3123 2018-09-20 18:11:46 Or get some paper lunch sacks, pop the popcorn in them in the microwave, add oil/butter and salt, and presto. Cheaper, healthier, and way better than packaged microwave popcorn.

3126 2018-09-20 18:11:31 That's right everything needs to be done here we need our own factories. We don't need to rely on China for anything. If we could survive on our own Oil & Gas products. Independence relying on ourselves America, Freedom from other countries self-reliant
3127 2018-09-20 18:11:29 Nitin-Chetan Sandesara have companies like SEEPCO, STERLING OIL, BOGEL n other companies in Nigeria in which they employ Indians n hold salaries for 5-6 months and if someone leaves the companies they don't pay.

3128 2018-09-20 18:11:12 America has started to revisit her decision of cutting Pakistan's aid. Saudi Arabia has agreed to be part of CPEC & build 'Oil City' in Gawadar. Dubai has agreed to invest in #Pakistan after 5 years of a cold relationship with pakistan.#naya pakistan
3129 2018-09-20 18:11:10 Have you tried cod liver oil? I have a weakened right knee that can ache from time to time but that stuff does wonders especially 3 caps daily! Happy to hear about the writing though I’m on route home after a long workday! Food come at me
3130 2018-09-20 18:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: undercooked crust with fresh motor oil and egg.
3131 2018-09-20 18:11:06 yeah but then how to get the money after the sale 

I feel like there’s a lot of steps between “acquire oil” and “sell it illegally”
3132 2018-09-20 18:10:58 แสนเหี้ยคือกุอ่ะ เสียงปลั๊กน้ำหอมแบบ oil ไว้ ละแม่งหก อก ละเสียดายค่าน้ำหอมมากแง๊ หกหมดเลยน้ำมันหอมระเหยกู
3133 2018-09-20 18:10:47 Country services on taxes,how comes oil is not taxed?
3134 2018-09-20 18:10:47 every minister should travel to bus or auto coz they r wasting tax payer money by using oil it is expensive
3135 2018-09-20 18:10:42 my nan brought my mom hemp oil to help her sleep and my mom just now whispered "marijuanna" to me sdvvsdvsrgdbdbtd
3136 2018-09-20 18:10:24 You're 100% right, and it is scary AF to be a male right now. Slavery w abolished, but clearly the mentality behind it has been maintained so much so that its oil never seems to need a new filter.
3137 2018-09-20 18:10:20 Obama was guiding the country on that path but Trump is now reversing everything in favor of Big Oil and Big Coal.
3138 2018-09-20 18:10:18 cant beleive we in 2018 and still driving oil driven automobiles, its cuz the left and the right and the powers that be make way too much off oil and gasoline so why quit now, and to buy an electric car to avoid this costs start at 50k for a new functional electric car, Fuckd Up!

3142 2018-09-20 18:09:48 oil
3143 2018-09-20 18:09:44 Duh, I know that. I said it can't replace oil completely at this time. But continued support of alternative energy sources will gradually reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
3144 2018-09-20 18:09:42 My former landlord just contacted me because the new tenants can’t find the oil fill for the heater. I moved 1.5 years ago. You’d think they needed heat before now? #awkwardconvo
3145 2018-09-20 18:09:38 It is better for USA to collaborate with IRAN, USA is the largest supplier of steel and IRAN is the largest supplier of oil.On other hand China is developing relationships with Pakistan.USA had a bad relationship with Korea also and now negotiated.
3146 2018-09-20 18:09:37 We really drove all the way to Kirkland to wait 2hrs for a free oil change
3147 2018-09-20 18:09:30 I am technically a liquid, molding to your needs! They say I have the consistency of vegetable oil... delicious! #OrganelleVote2018
3148 2018-09-20 18:09:28 Actually, Venezuela does not need to profit from oil. It is not like it is going anywhere soon.

300 billion barrels in reserves. A billion barrels a year would last 300 years.

And that is almost 3 million barrels a day.
3149 2018-09-20 18:09:17 That is such BS. Canada has been a world leader in this area. Compare our track record with any of the other world leaders in oil production.
3150 2018-09-20 18:09:15 bring it in with legit oil but without doc?
tampered pressure gauges etc
3151 2018-09-20 18:09:01 Please stop the BS lies.  'Ethical Alberta oil' is market spin. The Tar sands oil, despite efforts, is still extremely dirty and polluting to produce. Our industry and #abpoli  would spin that our oil is 'ethical' rather than be honest, and really improve the way it is produced.
3152 2018-09-20 18:08:57 You should try using some decent coconut oil instead of butter 
3153 2018-09-20 18:08:51 Kevin’s probably knows the exact date she needs an oil change
3154 2018-09-20 18:08:37 Please focus on CBD oil and our endocannabinoid system guys.  Phytocannabinoids are in other plants like hops too, this isn't about cannabis or even hemp.  CBD oil is the ONLY thing that's helped my autism in 36 years out of 22 different synthetic prescriptions.
3155 2018-09-20 18:08:37 Even in a hot stock market and a hot economy, Trump will still have a political ruin for high inflation and high oil price.

3157 2018-09-20 18:08:27 I quit eating pigs & cows in 1974, fish & birds in ‘75. After our 2nd child was born & my father’s retirement due to heart trouble, I slowly started to add fish back into my diet in ‘84, fish/fish oil supposedly good for the heart. Doritos & cheese dip will probably kill me.
3158 2018-09-20 18:08:23 I love getting ripped off to pay more money every time i try to get my oil changed!! It’s so great how they take advantage of me not knowing anything at all about cars!

3161 2018-09-20 18:08:16 When have we EVER protected the Middle East? We kill their children regularly for oil and advantage. Or, have you not been paying attention?
3162 2018-09-20 18:08:11 Today's lunch slice is The Cabrini: Thin crust, Olive Oil, a bit of Tomato Sauce, Smoked Mozzarella, Fresh Italian Sausage, Red Peppers! #DinosForLunch
3163 2018-09-20 18:08:10 Yall pay $65 for an oil change at the shop when its $15.99 to do it yourself.
3164 2018-09-20 18:07:54 Peut etre une bonne nouvelle pour l'ecologie. Le duo US-Chine a conduit a une croissance mondiale de dechets, du CO2 et du mercure atmospherique en passant par tout le plastique toxique des cochonneries produite en 15 ans qui flottent maintenant un peu partout.
3165 2018-09-20 18:07:51 Not clever . she knows how to torture others very well it seems. That chillies boiled in oil was such an criminal idea. Room potty yosikkaraanga pola.nalla varuvanga..
3166 2018-09-20 18:07:38 When you don’t have money to purchase oil anymore 
3167 2018-09-20 18:07:16 What’s wrong with canola oil? You suggest vegetable or corn oil?
3168 2018-09-20 18:07:11 Thank you for completing the refineries across Nigeria , we can now refine our crude oil locally...kudos, and also for resolving the issue with our Electricity, Nigerians cannot enjoy 24hours electricity.
3169 2018-09-20 18:07:02 Drill here. WE DON'T NEED THEIR OIL.
3170 2018-09-20 18:06:58 give you one example my family own part of Malaysia largest plantation owner and producer of Palm oil to get that product to the EU is a complete red tape nightmare we have proven things like sustainability for one ETC ETC
3171 2018-09-20 18:06:56 Actual coconut oil all over me
3172 2018-09-20 18:06:39 She uses cbd oil which is legal in all 50 states. Weed in general is not illegal in California.
3173 2018-09-20 18:06:39 Just ordered the Pussypop and Miss Amor soap bar from @SHOPCHEAPYXO along with some snake oil. I’m TOO excited!
3174 2018-09-20 18:06:13 Just like the US gives aid to other countries, Venezuela gives aid, in the form of oil.

But, you are a fake capitalist. What do you know of charity?
3175 2018-09-20 18:06:13 Pour mon anniversaire, j’ai toujours demandé des cadeaux à mes parents, mais pour la 1ère fois j’ai demandé à Dieu, j’espère que j’aurai ce que je veux 
3176 2018-09-20 18:06:05 Coconut oil will fix your teeth Mr Best President EVER
3177 2018-09-20 18:06:03 To get prices down on oil you must increase supply. A little drop from Iran, Russia could do the trick. You can always shut them down again, especially if prices goed to around 43, where Shale Oil approaches uncompetitive territory.
3178 2018-09-20 18:06:03 Getting my oil changed then shopping for new tires later
3179 2018-09-20 18:06:01 hate Male Femdom is so massively redundant all the environmental stuff holding back big oil is removed Betsy wrecking havoc on socialism while liberals keep the focus on Trump capitalism could not be much happier the haters keep Themselves fueled by Misery from wings of same bird
3180 2018-09-20 18:05:58 They are the biggest exporter of oil to the US
3181 2018-09-20 18:05:57 I never use vegetable oil anymore. Coconut oil is where it’s at!
3182 2018-09-20 18:05:49 Oil field? Twic card..basic plus..dependin on who u know how to negotiate yo starting rate easy 5-7g’s a month
3183 2018-09-20 18:05:49 Trump is too young to be @POTUS 

Extremely inexperienced!

He doesn't understand ordinary Americans don't hold many stocks but they need to drive to work so high oil price is worse for them. Trump never needs to drive to work. He lives in the same building as his workplace.
3184 2018-09-20 18:05:49 Wow @Valvoline is really coming in clutch with this fast ass oil change. I’m so sick I really appreciate not having to wait hella ya’ll thank you 
3185 2018-09-20 18:05:47 That sounds bomb really thank you! I have some coconut oil mixes I use but I gotta get more essential oils and make a better concation for this
3186 2018-09-20 18:05:32 Only 11% of your oil import is Saudi
Majority comes from Canada= 40%
3187 2018-09-20 18:05:30 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3188 2018-09-20 18:05:30 What about KSA offer of oil city in gawadar ps
3189 2018-09-20 18:05:30 寝れね〜
3190 2018-09-20 18:05:14 Try a sweet potato… Opened up then smeared with coconut oil and cinnamon!
3191 2018-09-20 18:05:13 So they don't need to modernise production to produce profitability given global oil prices have fallen close to 50% from the previous highs.
3192 2018-09-20 18:05:04 2/ There are currently over 5 billion in energy projects already passed approval that are in the planning phases. I know this because we bid on the work. We have to get our oil to market and the previous government did nothing in ten years to get us there.
3193 2018-09-20 18:05:03 This is just silly. 

Cuba and Venezuela have a bilateral agreement based on their common socialist past.

Oil in Venezuela is abundant. They don't have to extract a pound from Cuba to feel validated.

And, sales to other people can subsidize the few litres Cubans need, anyway!
3194 2018-09-20 18:05:01 Who's dick do i gotta suck to get a palm oil free gluten free pb & j sandwich around here??? #willsuckdickforfreethough
3195 2018-09-20 18:04:58 Why do I have to buy German oil just bc I have a German car

3197 2018-09-20 18:04:47 Hey in case you haven’t heard Alaska has enough oil for the US   We just can’t still it. 
3198 2018-09-20 18:04:47 Like I save Good Genes for special occasions and treaty facials and alternate simple acids for daily use.  Go-to's rn are Olah Henrickson Truth Serum, May Coop Raw Sauce, Belif Aqua Bomb, and UFO oil by day, & Luna alternating nights and I skip it if I did anything harsh.
3199 2018-09-20 18:04:46 That’s the North Sea Oil revenue that the Scots will take with them...
3200 2018-09-20 18:04:40 Today in 2016, Shell Oil announces it will leave the bulk of its downtown offices after 45 years for Woodcreek campus.
3201 2018-09-20 18:04:38 YOU ARE the enemy of all who love our ocean & coastlines as your  HIDEOUS VOTING RECORD clearly shows!
-opposed Clean Water Act (repeatedly)
-opposes scientific data & peer-reviewed research
-supports renewal of offshore oil drilling

Real Surfers wouldn't endanger our coast!
3202 2018-09-20 18:04:35 Stop giving billion dollar incentives to the oil & gas industry and use their tax revenue to save it.
3203 2018-09-20 18:04:29 Trillion dollar oil funded and highly strategically located on North Atlantic Norway has a northern land border with Russia. Just saying.
3204 2018-09-20 18:04:27 I thought we were talking CBD oil lol
3205 2018-09-20 18:04:26 This Nigga King Promise' Bald Head Looks Like a Baby Ass , Too Smooth,  Surely He Uses Baby Wipes And Johnson's Oil On It ..
3206 2018-09-20 18:04:20 Russia considers the dollar a toxic currency because of the sanctions, so it will sell oil, gas, aluminum, titanium, and other goods for any currency excluding the dollar.
3207 2018-09-20 18:04:17 Uncle Stephen 
3208 2018-09-20 18:04:10 PEOPLE   ARE  ALREADY TIRED  OF  OIL  IF  THEY DECIDE  THAT IF "MINISTERS  MEET" FROM  WHERE THEY (BJP) GOING  GET VOTES.    DR.C.B.BAGGA,M.D.
3209 2018-09-20 18:04:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i hate you get a new one time i want to a slenderman x reader in birthright.
3210 2018-09-20 18:03:54 Then why are you not working on reducing our reliance on oil??  Ohhh bc ur beholden to not just Putin.  Ur just a puppet spitting out crap.
3211 2018-09-20 18:03:54 I haven’t had my oil changed in over a year, am i going to die
3212 2018-09-20 18:03:50 Visit  by imran khan to uae and saudi are sucessfull and he take investment in pakistsn in oil sector. This is what he want.He will bring more and big invest just after some time.
3213 2018-09-20 18:03:47 We need the power to take on the world for oil.... I mean freedom 
3214 2018-09-20 18:03:31 Still in the hood like some oil, we can trunk ya man's.
3215 2018-09-20 18:03:23 Russia considers the dollar a toxic currency because of the sanctions, so it will sell oil, gas, aluminum, titanium, and other goods for any currency excluding the dollar.
3216 2018-09-20 18:03:14 Is your laughable position that small countries like Luxembourg, Grenada and Norway are capable of having armies but Scotland isn't!?imperialism isn't our goal. Scotland is producing more oil and gas now than it ever has and it still has 100 years left. Tourism is booming.
3217 2018-09-20 18:03:11 13% for people making a million a year is too low

The industry they are in shouldn't matter, but that's politicians pleasing their donors just like Texas having breaks for oil companies
3218 2018-09-20 18:03:04 Trump is the sole cause for oil and gas prices going up. His trade wars are killing my buying power/budget.
3219 2018-09-20 18:03:02 Fish oil ยังอยู่ไหมคะ เหลือกี่เม็ดคะ
3220 2018-09-20 18:03:02 腹減った
3221 2018-09-20 18:02:53 You going to hold any in PR responsible for letting tons of aid rot in containers? 
Holding responsible those that let the infrastructure degrade in first place? 
Congressional investigations into corruption in PR government? No, it's all about getting Trump
3222 2018-09-20 18:02:21 Chief justice recovered alcohol from #Sharjeel sub jail by his own, which was proved as honey and olive oil, Chief justive was proven wrong by the system, this is the system. Everyone know NAB law proof of burden is accused responsibility how come ISB judges r unaware of it.
3223 2018-09-20 18:02:19 MPL oil and Aunty Jackie's shampoo and conditioner  Food that makes my hair happy.
3224 2018-09-20 18:02:12 Yes! For me, the signs are: diffusing peppermint essential oil, clearing the desk of clutter (who cares that the clutter is now just stacked somewhere else to be dealt with later), and rain sounds in noise-cancelling headphones.
3225 2018-09-20 18:02:10 @Drinkin_Bros just sent the “go buy coconut oil” text myself
3226 2018-09-20 18:02:04 How about moving away from Oil? You know all those steps @BarackObama took that you rolled back. Stable genius 
3227 2018-09-20 18:01:55 This is nothing new.  My husband of 35 years still reminds me when engine went out while dating my answer to when was last time got an oil change was "I don't know, maybe a few years".
3228 2018-09-20 18:01:52 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4 Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3229 2018-09-20 18:01:49 everything was right until the oil change required part 
3230 2018-09-20 18:01:41 Don’t expect a reply until he can run this by Trump and his snake oil salesmen for the scripted appropriate response.

3235 2018-09-20 18:01:09 I make a balm out of raw cocoa butter, coconut oil, peppermint,lavender and lemon essential oil. You can also just add a drop of either peppermint or lavender with a carrier oil just to rub on lower abdomen
3236 2018-09-20 18:00:43 Drake definitely gave Kim an oil change & a tune up...
3237 2018-09-20 18:00:41 Their LP here just got their Oil license. Was a great trade up to $24.
3238 2018-09-20 18:00:38 I was all about MCT, butter, cream and coffee when I started NSNG. Cream is what I only have now although there is some benefits to MCT oil or coconut oil
3239 2018-09-20 18:00:34 What if we think of data not as oil or money, but as asbestos, dynamite, kryptonite?

the framing of things matters. We need to have framings that encourage data minimisation!

3240 2018-09-20 18:00:34 I think the worst part about being a woman in the oil field is that when I have to pee I have to walk 109474810 miles to get to the closest port-a-pottie bc I’m not allowed to pop a squat behind the truck
3241 2018-09-20 18:00:32 You don’t see the jobs leaving this province in the oil and gas industry? You’re “when” tweet was just as insulting. Our investors will literally lose millions if he’s re-elected. He’s KILLING our oil and gas industry. You took pleasure in my pain. Should I be insulted too?

3252 2018-09-20 17:59:57 You mean like Ireland, with the fastest growing economy in the EU, with the added benefit of oil. Only 10% of population and almost 305 of land mass, we'll be fine. However Little Englanders, trying to pay for superpower symbols that you can't afford now will be fun to watch.

3265 2018-09-20 17:58:47 THE PLAN 1970 -The most equal time in history - Wealthiest 1% only earned less than 6% of the national income, its lowest recorded level.  Banker pay was on par with a Teachers and GP’s.  Cracks in society were all ready showing, Strikes and inflation, started with the oil
3266 2018-09-20 17:58:44 Hmm, lemme just buy some Beard Oil for my....hold on...Daaaamn!  At them prices I'm expecting at the very least a War involving 3 countries at some point in the future. It's like £99,000,0000 for

3272 2018-09-20 17:58:21 $80 for an oil change??? In Yuma I paid only 40 and it was the same oil. Ugh 
3273 2018-09-20 17:58:07 No, creating ELECTRICITY can rely on alternative energy like wind and solar (obviously  not completely yet at this time). But Trump is trying to push us back to oil and coal instead. And surprise, I don't mind nuclear energy, it's way cleaner than coal. It just needs upgrading.
3274 2018-09-20 17:58:06 Yeah so he can get s cut on Russian oil or Ukraine government.
3275 2018-09-20 17:58:06 Thankful for coworkers who can always tell me how to fix my car since I don’t even know how to change my oil 
3276 2018-09-20 17:58:06 I guess you could also try and sink ice in canola oil for the same effect, vs. slightly yellow (food coloring) H2O where ice would float.
3277 2018-09-20 17:57:51 @RichEisenShow If you need milk,ice,Carmel or hazelnut in coffee,that’s not coffee and you shouldn’t call yourself a coffee drinker. 
If cheese isn’t good enough and you need an assortment of meats,oil or fruit on pizza,
you should order a Stromboli.

If we wanted the oil then just capture saudi arabia - I am sure we have a million reasons to do so!

3299 2018-09-20 17:56:20 How is tar sands bitumen oil ethical when the environmental damage done to the surrounding area is in no way ethical. I challenge Jason Kenney to drink some of the water in the region for a month
3300 2018-09-20 17:56:18 This is an arrogant statement, USA only protect its interests in ME, you yourself dear president do not care about peace only money & oil.
3301 2018-09-20 17:56:17 The stupidest feeling in the world is being unemployed while buying a new tire and getting your oil changed.
3302 2018-09-20 17:56:13 Idk why this oil change is a loose 100
3303 2018-09-20 17:56:11 Honestly man with the oil rigs being so close down to us the welders our there make damn good fucking money. Ain’t pushing you to do anything but for welding you should be pushing for way more than 15$. For sure go for a company that realizes your worth
3304 2018-09-20 17:55:44 / ohh i’m sorry darling, i hate it when people don’t know how to do a simple oil change. do you know what they messed up?
3305 2018-09-20 17:55:35 I should check my oil its been awhile.. like since I made the trip south..
3306 2018-09-20 17:55:31 COMO UDS COLOCAN O REDACTAN LA INFORMACIÓN, ESE PTE SE ABROGA PODERES TRANSNACIONALES MUNDIALES PARA DECIDIR. NO ESTÁ "PIDIENDO" CON LA EXPRESIÓN "DE INMEDIATO, ES IMPERATIVA". ESTÁ ORDENANDO. LE AFECTA SU ECONOMÍA Y DECIDE LESIONAR ECONOMÍAS PETROLERAS QUE VIVEN DE LA RENTA OIL
3307 2018-09-20 17:55:28 One of the best feelings ever is getting your car worked on, getting an oil change, then cleaning her out

3313 2018-09-20 17:55:02 This thing hurts. Even Uganda who transport their oil through Kenya  sell it cheaper

How u can build refinery in gawader when even power source does not exist.  Port oil terminal not exist. Water does not exist . He does mot know basics .requesting India. Why he is so hurry . Fooling public
3315 2018-09-20 17:54:50 Got the tickets and we got the room today! All I have to do is order shirts and get an oil change!
3316 2018-09-20 17:54:40 Chretien and Martin did likewise in their day. Libs are big spenders and liars. Canadians need to wake up to the fact the USA will soon be self sufficient wrt oil and gas.  We must get our resources to tide water asap
3317 2018-09-20 17:54:39 They've been around for a while already wonder if it was truly just big oil putting the damper on em....

Also, in MN winters combustion engines seem like they'd do better than electric. IDK just thinking out loud.

3323 2018-09-20 17:54:23 Don't you think they should wait for the oil price rally ?
3324 2018-09-20 17:54:06 @realDonaldTrump The boycott of oil is more than what you think is great, and if you are exempted from one country, you will face the devastating wrath of us and the liberals, and do not doubt that these Democrats will take Congress. Do not forget we are watching everything
3325 2018-09-20 17:54:04 "Sanctions bopped on North Korean oil smuggling front" does have a sense of adorable dread to it
3326 2018-09-20 17:53:56 XD no its antifreeze I had my heater core valve replaced last month and I have a sneaking suspicion it failed or was installed wrong also don't forget to check your oil
3327 2018-09-20 17:53:45 I put coconut oil all up in my hair and put a shower cap over it so when I eventually get the motivation to go shower, my hair will be ready to wash it out.
3328 2018-09-20 17:53:43 use tea tree oil !
3329 2018-09-20 17:53:40 @realDonaldTrump If they really have such an intention, I'm sorry for them. We stood firmly in our position and Iran's oil exports should be completely cut off by November 4th, President Trump's treachery for the Iranian people will be expensive for you.
3330 2018-09-20 17:53:35 Mr. Trump you have to force them to get the price down of oil co z you are thier master.
3331 2018-09-20 17:53:32 Lose this hollow phrase "ethical oil".  All oil is extracted and used for one basic purpose:  making money. The "ethics" of the country which extracts it are irrelevant (as evidenced by the fact that multinationals operate globally)
3332 2018-09-20 17:53:27 As current EU members we already tick all the boxes of the necessary criteria required. As Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, biggest fishing waters and biggest spirit producer not to mention agriculture and a whole host of other lovely jublies, it's hard to see why not.
3333 2018-09-20 17:53:26 really embarrassing when you rush to the garage because your break lights flashing, go in and asks me to open the bonnet ..was like what?? can i do that??? car needs oil? what?is?that? 
3334 2018-09-20 17:53:16 Gosh, I wonder if pushing green energy initiatives would make us less dependent on foreign oil sources. 
3335 2018-09-20 17:53:04 Deserving moment for my Oil City freestyle so I pinned it on my TL. Kindly check it out and tell me if God is not alive. So much truth and real talks all manifesting now

3337 2018-09-20 17:52:34 She said that or oil of olay
3338 2018-09-20 17:52:24 No!We don't protect them!We protect our Military Installations.Outside of Iraq+Syria.Those Middle East Countries have state of the art weapons + support each other,but we are obligated to keep oil flowing 4 economic reasons 4 our own good.We should be payin them 2 keep air bases
3339 2018-09-20 17:52:18 So stocks may not fall immediately but won't go high too much. Tariffs and inflation will be real. Interest rate will go high. Debt will go high. Oil goes high too if economy and stocks don't fall. So we r stuck. I don't know how Trump can get reelected in this mess.
3340 2018-09-20 17:52:07 What is the percentage of fracked oil in the World Market?

3347 2018-09-20 17:51:52 The reason why you help a person or develop altruistic feelings is NOT because you believe in a tree, or a paper clip, or Jesus or ingine oil. 

You do it because you are a human being and it's the right thing to do.

3350 2018-09-20 17:51:39 The scent of olive oil kills me. Qui m'envoyé !? 
3351 2018-09-20 17:51:37 Motor oil would have been better to drink than any energy drink.
3352 2018-09-20 17:51:30 Is their any assurances that they would purchase Alberta oil, or is it still just a hypothetical discussion? Of course we have no assurances we can get it to them yet, but some sort of market confirmation would be great.

3354 2018-09-20 17:51:24 Females dont know what oil changes are they are the 1% of people who sit there and say “I know my car” when the gas is touch E

In this I have bb cream on tho.
3356 2018-09-20 17:51:16 My damn car could be scooting down 501 and I still won’t go get an oil change 
3357 2018-09-20 17:51:15 Leave the oil in the ground. Knock knock knock: anyone home? Lighting fossil fuels on fire is changing the composition of the atmosphere.

3360 2018-09-20 17:50:58 We have to increase the prices of the oil so we can pay for your protection!!
3361 2018-09-20 17:50:55 You are arguing in short term ( by the way this is what lead us to not act on climate crisis)you said cooler places, in long term there ain’t be any « cooler » places! Air conditioning? Working with which energy? Oil?coal? None of this will be there in 150 years!renewables may be
3362 2018-09-20 17:50:50 You can make some for little to know money. Brown sugar, almond oil, a little bit of lemon juice.

3365 2018-09-20 17:50:36 Tea tree oil kuat sikit ! Jadi mmg akan ada rasa pedih  jadi kalau sensitif, guna amount sikit je or try guna yg lain
3366 2018-09-20 17:50:26 $WTI $OIL seems to have  topped out again @ 71.5 resistance! Keep in  mind when trading Oil and Gas!
3367 2018-09-20 17:50:21 You brave. I don’t think I’d try oil by myself. I just imagine myself with a face full of oil.
3368 2018-09-20 17:50:18 Only when non-conservative governments are in charge.
In Alberta, Premier Notley apparently tanked world oil prices. We still are not clear of her motivations. Conservatives will only say because the sky is blue (not a Conservative blue though).
3369 2018-09-20 17:50:15 Oil Change! If your car konks out you will have bigger problems than bushy eyebrows 
3370 2018-09-20 17:50:07 The US recently became the largest crude oil producer in the world... behind Saudi Arabia and Russia... so...

3374 2018-09-20 17:49:51 hi, alguien vendame un oil
3375 2018-09-20 17:49:51 @mike_pence Unlike your boss you must have a clear cut grip on American investment up here in Canada?  Lot of American oil and gas, mining companies deeply troubled and worried of your bosses shrewd lunacy one way thinking.   Trumps grandparents made their fortune in Canada.
3376 2018-09-20 17:49:45 Mena surface is10.5 sq.kms with a population of 300 ml (same as USA) many of its countries have been exploiting oil and gas for over 70 years but did not industrialize nor develop their agricultures which left unemployment and illiteracy at highest and insurance at lowest level
3377 2018-09-20 17:49:45 Change air and engine filters, check oil, put in windshield wiper fluid that is as far as I will go. I can change a tire too, but nah I’m calling someone to do that
3378 2018-09-20 17:49:41 ร้องก็บอกกกกก จะได้ไปโอ๋
3379 2018-09-20 17:49:28 Lol I just hate coconut oil. Way too oily and it doesn't soak in my skin so it's just oil sitting on my hands xD
3380 2018-09-20 17:49:26 Yes I’m worried about the orcas right now too because it seems they lost their greatest hope for recovery with J50 last week. The notion of putting more oil tankers in the very waters where these beautiful animals live is ridiculous.
3381 2018-09-20 17:49:25 I change my windshield wipers, light bulbs, check my oil.... the other night I had to shimmy under to partially reattach the undercarriage cover.

3384 2018-09-20 17:48:44 So you think there is an infinite amount of food, labor to produce it and oil to ship it?
3385 2018-09-20 17:48:44 This is true, I know one of the guys who helped organize how it is recycled and it’s amazing how no one is talking about that. Mike doesn’t realize that he’s making things worse for Canada, but better for US oil companies.

Mike, stop yourself!
3386 2018-09-20 17:48:38 US overtakes Russia and Saudi Arabia for the first time in 45 years to becomes the world's largest oil producer #MarkOfHope #ThursdayThoughts
3387 2018-09-20 17:48:33 So it's not a conflict of interest when the head of an oil company is put in charge of the EPA, but if you have donated money to the Democrats, that's different. Got it.
3388 2018-09-20 17:48:24 As everyone’s said, get on the acid exfoliation and I also 100% advocate for the classic double cleanse - an oil/balm cleanse to remove makeup then a gel/regular cleanser to clean the actual skin
3389 2018-09-20 17:48:23 Let’s hope UKOG comes good 
3390 2018-09-20 17:48:22 LMAO STOP MY OIL IS CHANGED
3391 2018-09-20 17:48:21 You'll also have to rub oil on her
3392 2018-09-20 17:48:15 Not very, bright things are OFTEN subsidized until it can pay for itself. But you're okay with subsidizing big oil that makes multi billions in profit every ear?
3393 2018-09-20 17:48:15 This is the shit man, we dont have the same kind but I see you! The wife and I use the oil exclusively. 6gs you the man!
3394 2018-09-20 17:48:15 @SherleyEd19 The country has a massive oil larger than Venezuela, but we can't touch it..why can't we, they can't kill the entire population just to secure the oil.. L'Union Fait La Force, forget about PetroKaribe, let invest in our own oil Exploration
3395 2018-09-20 17:48:14 Who cares, the United States owns the biggest oil world reserves and is the world's biggest oil producer without much noise. Jus let's them sink themselves.
3396 2018-09-20 17:48:12 I know how to change my own oil, brakes, and tires, do a temporary fix on a radiator, change my air filter. All that. No I don't want a cookie, but I think it's pretty cool that I know this stuff. thanks dad
3397 2018-09-20 17:48:11 /2 

Most folks respond that other commodities (like wheat) have “inherent value” which $BTC lacks. This is a misconception.

Crypto assets are fundamentally pipelines for transmitting value. Just as you can price space in a pipeline for transmitting oil - you can price $BTC.
3398 2018-09-20 17:48:10 Today I walked in the dealership and said “I’m just here for an oil change. Dassit. No need to suggest anything because I don’t want it today” How much you want to bet they’ll still suggest something ?
3399 2018-09-20 17:48:07 #SUACCF18 Recently, the price of crude is continuously rising and it reaches $71.12 a barrel in the U.S. President Trump tweeted that countries in the Middle East shouldn't higher the price of oil anymore because their protections are under controlled by the U.S.

3403 2018-09-20 17:47:56 Why can’t Pakistan merge in Saudi Arabia? They have oil, Pakistan has Army, can become a Super-power.

3409 2018-09-20 17:47:38 Shit, I need an oil change.
3410 2018-09-20 17:47:29 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3411 2018-09-20 17:47:24 Please lets stop using food as fuel. Ethanol is not a good alternative to pure petroleum.  Gas or Diesel.  Now using reclaimed oil for cooking is useful to a point. Lets grow corn for eating not my engine.
3412 2018-09-20 17:47:03 So y’all where can I get an oil change
3413 2018-09-20 17:47:02 also you can infuse oils as well. coconut oil works the best imo. Ive always wanted to make infused ice cream. Get some grapeseed oil and infuse it using crock pot. then when making ice cream add in 1tbsp at time and taste until you get the desired flavor so not 2 strong
3414 2018-09-20 17:46:52 On Tuesday, the Environment Minister said it is NS Power's responsibility to prevent another oil spill like the one at Tuft's Cove. Is the Department of Energy and Mines doing anything to prevent another spill? - @susanleblancMLA #nspoli
3415 2018-09-20 17:46:44 Cooking gas is Current Price -subsidy i.e around 500 and pwtrol price is crude oil price + congress loot = current price . Otherwise sugar is 31 oil is 90 and pulses are 50-60 tomato 20 potato onion 20 per kg. GADDAR CONGRESS MAKKAAR CONGRESSI THOOO
3416 2018-09-20 17:46:40 Olive oil is just fine as a replacement for canola oil in baking. But the rest of this shit is monstrous.
3417 2018-09-20 17:46:28 Franks red hot is basically truffle oil for midwesterners.
3418 2018-09-20 17:46:19 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.

How can I enable a more frequent update?

3425 2018-09-20 17:45:46 We're big fans of the #bluewave. You're a big fan of allowing Trump to sell off California's coast to new offshore oil drilling. @HarleyRouda will stand up for our coast.

3429 2018-09-20 17:45:17 Well since they have no pipeline access to Eastern Canada they have a lot of problem sending their oil to market. That is why last week their oil was selling at an $18/barrel differential to the exact same oil from the exact same formation south of the border.

3434 2018-09-20 17:44:58 The problem is when your average car owner pulls into a Valvoline and gets the cheapest oil change option (conventional or even sometime recycled oil) then stretch the next change to 15,000 miles.
3435 2018-09-20 17:44:57 So u expect us to put mobil 1 oil & provide filter and labor for $30  gtf out the shop

3437 2018-09-20 17:44:34 Drumpfy asked for oil prices to be raised! I love how he just demands shit be done his way. I’m too tired today to go on; I need a nap.
3438 2018-09-20 17:44:32 Enviros very successful at delaying oil and gas projects throughout various basins.  Costs for projects soar and end market users suffer. @jstewartenergy #ARC2018
3439 2018-09-20 17:44:17 And just like that, patchouli oil and hemp bracelet sales in the surrounding area skyrocket. Thanks for supporting the local economy, ladies.

3444 2018-09-20 17:44:01 because you need to get your oil changed hoe
3445 2018-09-20 17:43:48 Good to know you never intend to drive a car or use anything manufactured from petrochemicals. If you plan to do either of those, it will be your problem if Trump causes oil prices to rise.
3446 2018-09-20 17:43:44 That is your best one. i would buy that an put it up for real..brilliant.
3447 2018-09-20 17:43:43 Are you seriously praising Mr snake oil? Shame on you

3449 2018-09-20 17:43:30 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
3450 2018-09-20 17:43:24 Africa had enough oil gold etc to go it alone an now Africa has to pay for bad management how can Africa be importing metals it sells how can Africa be taxed on oil itt sells how can Africa be importing everything food etc when it can produce
3451 2018-09-20 17:43:16 3) The only way to get involved is to pump billions at it and gatecrash the party. City did that & were then riduculed every step of the way. Dirty oil money etc. Then UEFA & cohorts like Rumineggie made their presence felt their cosy cartel was threatend by an underdog.

3454 2018-09-20 17:43:04 Where you located bro ? I need an oil change on Saturday
3455 2018-09-20 17:42:59 It all depends on whether it’s synthetic or not. Newer cars can run on synthetic up to 10k miles (my dealership told me this after buying a 2018) while older cars on regular oil need a change every 3k
3456 2018-09-20 17:42:55 All right let's go! I like a check like Alaskans get for oil.

3468 2018-09-20 17:41:59 good, go get ur damn oil changed 
3469 2018-09-20 17:41:47 Like coal to liquid? That would serve his purposes. He doesn’t acknowledge global warming. All he has to do is get congress to further subsidize coal for the purpose of converting it to oil via a 1950’s army recipe.

3498 2018-09-20 17:39:16 we can start by reducing:

-wars of choice like Iraq
-tax cuts & loopholes for the rich
-defense spending
-military bases around the world
-farm, oil, & corporate subsidies
-defense contract spending
-the ban on importing pharmas
-bank fraud

social spending is not the problem.
3499 2018-09-20 17:39:13 Why are we not using our own oil, instead of their oil. We don't need to buy their oil. All they want to do is destroy America. I say its time to let them be on their own

3514 2018-09-20 17:38:06 You would think Mr. Schachter might agree with considering his continuously restated theory of an epic multiyear oil bull run, commencing in "late" October or November (his words) on a magnitude only seen for the third time in his life.

3532 2018-09-20 17:36:45 Saudi Arabia wasn't forced. They thought they could play game theory pump more oil drop price + kill of the  US frackers by making them unviable. They  correctly assessed frackers  would make US a net exporter and self sufficient in oil requirement

3549 2018-09-20 17:34:49 I see shares as long term. Take Ocado. I took those shares at £5. Deal after deal it flew higher: 11.00 at one point. I’m Still holding at £9. 
People shorted it and did very well. However there’s more deals in the pipeline and the long holder always wins.

3554 2018-09-20 17:34:18 We are leverage stick for them to bargain down the other options. You remove cheap oil & the deck of cards tumble. With NAFTA on the table, expect the to use that against out oil & pipelines also.

3569 2018-09-20 17:33:10 The price of oil is determined by the global market.  This is not rocket science and the average person understands this.  Apparently your small brain is incapable of understanding facts.  You can throw all the fits you want, but nobody is going to kowtow to your demands.
3570 2018-09-20 17:32:58 we have our own oil, but the domestic producers won't sell their product until they get an inflated price. Look it up,  research Texas refineries, they stop production unless oil prices are up. Greedy here and OPEC too.
3571 2018-09-20 17:32:53 Mr Bob.. Looks like you had fundraiser  party with the Big Oil
3572 2018-09-20 17:32:45 Interesting since Canada provides most of the US oil.
3573 2018-09-20 17:32:34 Forget about jailing ourselves!  FOCUS on our   INFRASTRUCTURES!  You still get money from that (more useful for Americans).  Look closely within ourselves, road, transportation systems, education systems, health care, alternative energies etc. NOT STUPID WALL AND OIL PRICE!

3580 2018-09-20 17:32:16 Ah, there lies the rub.  The politicians have become weapons merchants lubricated by Big Oil with the Salafi/US/UK/jihadists as goon squads.  We have to show our muscle, which is our numbers.  Maybe a strike?
3581 2018-09-20 17:32:08 does the "like" mean it is oil?

3588 2018-09-20 17:31:27 Great idea Donald. Get OPEC to lower it's "monopoly" prices of oil to get world economy growing again.

3591 2018-09-20 17:31:21 lol. yea, same w/ EV Olive Oil. The Google-drs. that recommend the try-at-home-first remedy, said the acid in cider & lemon might break up or dissolve stones. It seemed to work & it's better then a potential Percocet addiction. Good luck, hope everything comes out ok!
3592 2018-09-20 17:31:13 If i sprayed a spider with apple cider vinegar, peppermint extract, nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, hairspray, 3 different perfumes, glade, and an orange essential oil, and it fell down from the ceiling, so you think it died? Bc I just did.
3593 2018-09-20 17:30:57 There's really expensive ones that last longer, I've always oiled mine with vegetable oil when working at a restaurant after cleaning it. If you wantes to buy an expensive one I've always had good luck with cutco.

3613 2018-09-20 17:29:10 Last year they diverted a mile of our regional recreation trail around an oil operation. They recently restored the original route. Last night it rained and the now disturbed surrounding landscape flooded the trail with mud. Who didn't see that happening?
3614 2018-09-20 17:29:05 Listen I didn’t get an oil change for like 9 months and my car started shaking bc it literally had NO OIL in it. Share my testimony. I do not want her to deal with the same thing I did.
3615 2018-09-20 17:29:01 The most abundant oil reserves are also the hardest to extract ... But Americans can frack much more easily and cheaply?

3628 2018-09-20 17:28:03 #Breaking AMERICA has become the Worlds largest oil producer! First time in over 45 years! This is great news, not for a sustainable standpoint but as long as oil is going to be around I’d rather buy it from the US rather than Russia and Saudi’s. Well done #Trump!

3637 2018-09-20 17:27:35 Despite overwhelming evidence of carbon-fuelled climate change and billions in subsidies for alternative technologies such as wind and solar power, oil is so entrenched in the modern world that demand is still rising by up to 1.5 percent a year.

1 tablespoon of salt is 3 teaspoons 
4 tablespoons of coconut oil is 1/4 cup

3660 2018-09-20 17:26:07 You are without a doubt the dumbest idiot I've ever seen.  The US is not part of OPEC and we are the largest producer of oil in the world.  Why are we following OPEC's pricing policies?  EXXON, SHELL, and the rest of the US refiners are making a killing.

Why DID the global oil price decline when it did?

Why was Saudi Arabia forced to pump more and keep prices low despite global economic recovery and all time high demand?

Answer: geopolitics. Starve Venezuela and Iran.

You have eyes. Do you see?

3693 2018-09-20 17:23:49 How about providing an actual critique of #BillC69 instead of denigrating people you disagree with. (although I think you'd be shocked at how many people in the oil patch eat avocado toast ...)
3694 2018-09-20 17:23:48 What do you think it is? It’s more than a pee tape for sure. IMO, it’s more than just Russian money and interference in our elections or an oil deal. I feel it’s something bigger but can’t figure exactly what. Scary.

3702 2018-09-20 17:23:04 I've just received an unexpected friend request on Facebook from a Dave Mendoza. He is a chief executive of an oil company and currently has five friends . Profile photo shows him driving a speed boat. As well as all this he has a beautiful beard. Seems legit to me. 
3703 2018-09-20 17:23:02 Speak to your commodity traders Donnie it is their speculative 'trades' which impact the price of oil.  And of course there are your own actions, eg sanctions on Iran which reduce the supply, and stock manipulation by USA companies.  Your friends in the oil industry are happy.
3704 2018-09-20 17:23:01 A favorite fast pizza- brush olive oil on a Molly B GF pizza crust, crumble  Feta cheese, add caramelized onions, bacon bits, pop into toaster oven. Dinner in 10 minutes @gr8glutenfree @organicgarage

3708 2018-09-20 17:22:13 Extra Virgin Olive Oil ini emang sebenernya gak disarankan untuk menumis karena lebih cocok dipakai untuk dressing salad. Tapi gak tau kenapa numis pake EVOO ini berasa lebih greget.
3709 2018-09-20 17:22:06 I read section 77, same act, the Oil and Gas Commission, or would it be, in British Columbia specifically, and B.C. reneged. I’ve asked 3/4
3710 2018-09-20 17:22:00 Goes to any auto shop and just call and make appointment for oil change
3711 2018-09-20 17:21:41 Nous sommes fiers d’annoncer que le groupe @ExxonMobil a rejoint la Oil and Gas Climate Initiative @OGCInews pour proposer des #solutions concrètes afin de contribuer ensemble à réduire les effets liés au changement climatique   #climatechange
3712 2018-09-20 17:21:40 Instead of oil we could put water in pipeline
3713 2018-09-20 17:21:39 I home-make pasta sauce (olive oil, big can o' crushed tomatoes, salt, garlic & onion powder, basil & oregano), then chop spinach and add it in for the last 5 mins of simmering. if you get frozen meatballs/sausages (chipotle are my fave) you can add those to each meal for protein
3714 2018-09-20 17:21:29 @hammy413 just curious if you've tried CBD oil for MS symptoms?
3715 2018-09-20 17:21:26 Donald Trump tweeted an accusation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries "continue to push for higher and higher oil prices" and "must get prices down now!" The tweet, Trump's first on OPEC since June, comes as oil prices have reached about $80 a barrel
3716 2018-09-20 17:21:26 it’s like im being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck being packed in with fertiliser and fuel oil pushed off a cliff by a suicidal mickey mouse
3717 2018-09-20 17:21:21 Sesame oil is very tasty and very healthy, too.

3720 2018-09-20 17:20:53 They have antics and shit talking on social media. That's it. Their only tactics and only resources.
3721 2018-09-20 17:20:33 Go renewable.  The sooner the better.  The more jobs in those fields there will be to replace oil field jobs.
3722 2018-09-20 17:20:30 Huuu the way those sunflowers will be used as cooking oil because it would take you forever to receive them. The florists will e-mail you for delivery address and you'll only attend to the e-mail after a week. #BOTCH

3729 2018-09-20 17:20:10 In a country that is need of leaders with original ideas and keen vision Saraki stands out. His articulation of a blueprint for Nigeria, with emphasis on an economy independent of crude oil to #GrowNigeria is what all is clamoring for.

3730 2018-09-20 17:20:09 LOL. I was going to say coconut oil.   I actually use Young Living's Rose Ointment, so that recommendation probably doesn't help either. 
3731 2018-09-20 17:20:05 Hoarded by the elite families who still control the Venezuelan economy. You and Alex both shill for big oil interests who want to regain control of Venezuelan oil, and Israel.
3732 2018-09-20 17:19:53 simple cleansing oil tu brp nk jual ? dah pakai brp kali?
3733 2018-09-20 17:19:53  I need to get an oil change?
3734 2018-09-20 17:19:39 I really am overdue for an oil change, my wiper fluid is low af, actually I think it's empty now 
3735 2018-09-20 17:19:28 Some argan oil might sooth the bottom ends a bit, just enough moisture to keep it smooth and avoid split ends
3736 2018-09-20 17:19:27 Then stop protecting them - this way we have resources to lower oil prices. That’s how capitalism works.
3737 2018-09-20 17:19:26 Finally getting an oil change!!! #theexcitinglife
3738 2018-09-20 17:19:26 Yesterday was my first time doing a pre-poo on my hair. I did it overnight with olive oil and aussie 3 minute miracle
3739 2018-09-20 17:19:20 Oh god one of my coworkers is talking about how she never puts moisturizer on her face and another is saying that coconut oil is good for your face and I am INTERNALLY SCREAMING
3740 2018-09-20 17:19:10 Oil changes should only be 30 bucks, niggas be taxing

3744 2018-09-20 17:18:48 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a non-GMO diet, and put some musk essential oil in my diffuser.
3745 2018-09-20 17:18:48 Accumulate in dips following stocks before starting results season 
√Good quality banks
√Good auto companies
√Good Oil & Gas co.
Stay tuned for stock & levels.
3746 2018-09-20 17:18:47 That means no more subsidies to oil companies. Medicare and SS aren’t free as people pay into that. A balanced budget means taxes will have to go up, so you can forget that. Let em try to cut Medicare and Social Security too. Welfare is a drop.
3747 2018-09-20 17:18:44 We have a one day online Oil Trading Boot Camp and a one day Swing Trading Boot Camp coming early November I'm excited about. Will be posted to website this weekend. $CL_F $WTI $USO #oiltrading #swingtrading

3750 2018-09-20 17:18:22 Venezuela and Mexico are suffering from the same problem because their oil is harder to extract.

Please don't join George in guesswork.
3751 2018-09-20 17:18:16 I called my dad to tell him my car needs an oil change & to confirm Honda does it for the free... he’s like I’ll take it for you on Sunday and I’ll wash your car inside and out . I have the best dad EVER.
3752 2018-09-20 17:18:16 Gayamai dai. Change your ways Bobrisky.

3757 2018-09-20 17:17:48 I was wondering wtf is cajeput. I didn't realise it was a different name for Tea Tree Oil or Melaleuca oil. (Eucalyptus I'm familiar with)
3758 2018-09-20 17:17:47 A classic oil painting class is a fabulous way to rediscover any long-lost humility.



Angles. Why does it have to be angles....
3759 2018-09-20 17:17:35 I would love a piece and if Eddie came home to that he would be shocked that I made it...I am better at roast dinners...though I cheat with Mark's yorkshires....
3760 2018-09-20 17:17:34 By the way, why did global oil prices fall?

Who has the world's largest known reserves of oil?

How do you "punish" them, and hit them where it hurts most?

I have learned that very many people do not know how to think in a 360° way.

It is too hard.
3761 2018-09-20 17:17:31 Oil change is done
3762 2018-09-20 17:17:25 You agreed too quick man. I have no inisde on Tinapa, but I really doubt that @Donald_Duke was out to make a quick buck. He was an idealist (not a saint), CRS anthem, flag, the range, pineapple factory, - I don't buy it. That project has sunk CRS along with oil wells taken.
3763 2018-09-20 17:17:23 Also apparently it’s CBD oil for her anxiety so it’s not even like she’s getting high.

3768 2018-09-20 17:17:08 Dude, oil prices are rising because of inflation
3769 2018-09-20 17:17:05 Qué buen trabajo. Maestro.
3770 2018-09-20 17:16:59 Almond oil helps or some jojoba oil. I like avocado oil for my hair because it helps it stay ultra soft so maybe that’ll help as well? These are all lightweight oils so they won’t leave a heavy feel on your hands
3771 2018-09-20 17:16:56 America becomes the world's LArgest oil producer after overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia for the first time in 45 years @realDonaldTrump

3773 2018-09-20 17:16:52 @realDonaldTrump 
You are creating crises with governments and you want to reduce oil spills slow down bee cool 
3774 2018-09-20 17:16:31 House cleaned, grocery shopping done, food in the crockpot, cars oil changed, and car washed. Productive day off
3775 2018-09-20 17:16:31 This sulfur 8 has my hair smelling SO bad, but who really want to wash, condition, moisturize, twist and oil a full head of natural hair? I’ll just get some nose plugs.
3776 2018-09-20 17:16:25 The US destabilized the Middle East invading Iraq and Afghanistan with a combination of wide eyed optimism and ignorance (Remember 2001 @GOP: "we will pay for this war with Oil Revenues in 4 months"??)

3779 2018-09-20 17:16:04 If facts matter (?), the biggest pressure on oil prices is from less Iran oil in the market, and we know where that comes from.
3780 2018-09-20 17:15:59 Put a little lavender oil on him. Maybe it will relax him. 
3781 2018-09-20 17:15:57 それな！
3782 2018-09-20 17:15:55 I hope you're right... I just don't have much faith in Grassley anymore.  I was impressed by his fight for ethanol, against Cruz and big oil, but I was embarrassed watching him in the Kavanaugh hearings.
3783 2018-09-20 17:15:34 Just a quick question I thought we were drilling for oil here?? Drill baby drill!!!
3784 2018-09-20 17:15:26 The agency he wants to abolish needs to make a visit to the Central Rolling Plains Co-Op Cotton Gin in Roscoe, TX which his deep in the heart of the west TX [big red] oil fields w/population 1400.

3787 2018-09-20 17:15:22 For the lips of a wayward woman drip like a honeycomb,
And her mouth is smoother than oil.

But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood
And as sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet descend into death.
Her steps lead straight to the Grave.
3788 2018-09-20 17:15:16 Dog owners - have any of you used cannabis oil for your dogs? Did you find it useful?
3789 2018-09-20 17:15:15 Let's just assume it works... repeatedly saying the name like babalawo is Nigeria Air an urgent need?
We skill 24/7 electricity, Functioning Hospitals that aren't death traps, Ending fuel scarcity and refining our crude oil. 

But you know... Nigeria Air is paramount 
3790 2018-09-20 17:15:14 I heard fish oil pills help with morning sickness
3791 2018-09-20 17:15:06 Substitute oil for mousse and that's exactly my technique too 
3792 2018-09-20 17:15:04 To make an Oil rich and Agricultural global nation one of a kind rare to the eyes Uganda being rated among them, We need to steer oil revenues into Healthcare, Education and Infrastructure.

3800 2018-09-20 17:14:40 If US production is now more than its requirement then why WTI prices are going up? 

What is the desired oil price so that shale companies will be up and running in profits?
3801 2018-09-20 17:14:38 I went to get my oil changed and I open the door and get out and my dab pen falls on the ground  I look at it and then the mechanic looks at it and laughs lmfaoo why

3803 2018-09-20 17:14:30 I’m surprised Putin let him call out for lower oil prices.
3804 2018-09-20 17:14:21 I thought ur trades are weekly / fortnightly & response in that context on the trade. 3 M / 6 M  forecast down the line is not possible in trump era on global issues. Flip flops . All things equal af now, OIL is heading higher .
3805 2018-09-20 17:14:19 Very funny.. "if she gets massage oil and that dress, I can tell you she won't get it out"

3821 2018-09-20 17:13:03 Who cares about pipelines this oil will be coming by rail triple fold now thanks to you. Not to mention on the most rugged sections of inaccessible tracks, and areas following the Fraser river. This is on your back and on your conscience.
3822 2018-09-20 17:13:01 I very much hate getting an oil change that requires me to relinquish my keys and sit in an office. If it wasn't necessary I'd be somewhere else.
3823 2018-09-20 17:12:58 It’s the oil companies themselves fatty they set the prices they shut down their factories to raise prices do you know how this stuff works you can’t just threaten countries it’s companies!!! Sad fat baby trump!!!!

3841 2018-09-20 17:11:43 Those two sentences should not be in the same tweet .. first you imply that the USA is too involved in the Middle East then second you tell OPEC to get oil prices down .. the USA is not involved in other countries for other then its own interests... you are a hypocrite...
3842 2018-09-20 17:11:30 Animal death] accidentally killed a mouse i was trying to save
poor lil buddy was caught in a glue trap & i was pouring a little oil over it to unstick the glue and i thought i was careful to avoid the head but it must have swallowed some & choked anyway
3843 2018-09-20 17:11:26 I hope someone switches GPS units or repaints the ship's name in the middle of the night. Some gold, old-fashioned salad oil fraud.
3844 2018-09-20 17:11:18 I remember the first time I went and got my oil changed I was scared as shit  My mom told me that if I don't get my oil changed regularly my car will blow up and I thought it would explode on the way there
3845 2018-09-20 17:11:01 Todavía no entran y ya dicen tener la presna en contra...

3848 2018-09-20 17:10:49 I never put oil in my hair outside of when i first wash it and blow dry it but i be lightly putting castor oil on my leave out every night now and my hair is happy
3849 2018-09-20 17:10:43 LMAOOO I’m gonna send you a pic of when I should’ve got an oil change and what I’m at now.

3853 2018-09-20 17:10:20 @waitrose disgusted to find that if I want a free latte in Waitrose that's dairy free I have to pay for the privilege. What happened to equality or progress? @IcelandFoods has an entire freezer of their own #vegan food and has shunned unsustainable palm oil, keep up!
3854 2018-09-20 17:10:10 With exciting illustrations of iterative changes to the design of the Mercedes B Class oil pan
3855 2018-09-20 17:10:05 Lots of deep conditioner. I really like lushes got oil treatment
3856 2018-09-20 17:10:04 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
3857 2018-09-20 17:10:02 All efforts by anti smoking programs, and efforts by parents to protect our children have been undermined by these vape oil producers! Time to shut them down people!!!!@hmattsdad
3858 2018-09-20 17:09:59 As long as it's not because of the oil fields
3859 2018-09-20 17:09:54 All the 3 are different quality of oil requiring different refinery processes. Hence increasing oil production does not mean higher revenue. But for US they become self reliant. And energy security gives you greater advantage in geo politics.
3860 2018-09-20 17:09:53 Oil spills
3861 2018-09-20 17:09:48 Earlier oil explorations in that region was from private cash nor govt e.g. shell so one way or the other money was still going to be found to explore the oil in the region
3862 2018-09-20 17:09:42 I’m 500 miles over my recommended oil change mileage...lol
3863 2018-09-20 17:09:21 Dan oil and petrochemical staff on a shakushaku dance step .
3864 2018-09-20 17:09:19 That is seriously brilliant. very well done.
3865 2018-09-20 17:09:05 Nope, bamboo dries out just like any other wood with repeated use and washing!  Hit it with the oil!
3866 2018-09-20 17:09:03 #ChequersPlan is dead then?

I wonder if #May used the same crawling on bended knees, whining pitifully with hands clasped in front of her posture that snake oil salesman Cameron used with them?
3867 2018-09-20 17:08:59 Trump: the 'OPEC monopoly', whos countries would nt be safe without US, must lowerprices.We protect the countries of MiddleEast, they would nt be safe for long without us, & yet they continue 2 push 4 higher oil prices! We will remember. OPEC monopoly must get prices down now
3868 2018-09-20 17:08:56 Incident 17:36 Property smoke logged due to hot oil in pan left on, no fire, advice only #Wellingborough
3869 2018-09-20 17:08:56 That's the funny part.  It will.
3870 2018-09-20 17:08:48 It will be great if they could set up a few km away from Gawadar. This city will grow and oil refineries will come in city limits.
3871 2018-09-20 17:08:35 I am so thankful and grateful I live a block away from the coop today. I was able to get teatree oil, lavender oil, free range eggs, and kettle chips and be home in under 10 minutes.
3872 2018-09-20 17:08:30 China is self sufficient BUT while WE'RE dumping all our money into WAR ~ they're buying OIL FUTURES so WE'LL be paying $20'$30/gal while they're chugging along at $7-$10.

War St. economy is poised on collapse.
Once student loan bubble bursts - it's over.
3873 2018-09-20 17:08:26 Thank you. So sad you feel Africa is not for other people. My white friends love Africa as much as I do. They do not want the global companies stealing our resources & paying our people very little. Are you angry at the oil companies? Some of our brothers are just as corrupt.
3874 2018-09-20 17:08:21 Arewa Bobrisky change your ways.
3875 2018-09-20 17:08:20 Ass licking niggas always jumping from one TL to another to lick ass.
3876 2018-09-20 17:08:05 Inherited some oil land in TX a few years back. When I got the paperwork on it (to sign) it lists the companies that drill on that land. One is from China! Don't know when they obtained it, but damn.
3877 2018-09-20 17:07:58 how did you see your reflection in the mirror without your glasses  the oil doing magic
3878 2018-09-20 17:07:41 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us MORE CORPORATE ABUSE!
3879 2018-09-20 17:07:39 100 % agree ...... so he will of course get three exhibition games as a suspension !Next Florida / Montreal game likely to be a gong show if that happens
3880 2018-09-20 17:07:10 If you had wanted to advice me sincerrly, you won't channel it through this your ass licking non payment attention seeking mode.
3881 2018-09-20 17:07:09 How about you know. Check your oil???

3884 2018-09-20 17:07:02 I thought we produce more oil now ,why do we need them?
3885 2018-09-20 17:06:46 I did make that with raspberries from garden.  I also made the cream cheese from scratch and the digestives.  I get bored
3886 2018-09-20 17:06:43 A tanker loaded with "fire erhm oil"
3887 2018-09-20 17:06:36 Thank you for opening up. Apology accepted. I'm a 33 yrs old male working as a professional engineer in multinational oil&gas industry. Unfortunately I was struggling with depression 2 yrs ago. Yes we exist.

But #BTS music and them as individuals really helped me.
3888 2018-09-20 17:06:26 He even behaves like them. Angry and bitter
3889 2018-09-20 17:06:25 absolutely in love with my new @beautybakerie cake mix foundation and baking oil  I'm getting such good coverage without the smearing and making my skin look dry
3890 2018-09-20 17:06:24 We would love to have you here, Zack. I think we share the same love for avocado oil dressing, so that's enough for us to become besties.  *KaeW
3891 2018-09-20 17:06:24 He’s a snake oil salesman. With some really shitty snake oil.
3892 2018-09-20 17:06:19 IN OTHER WORDS YOU CHILD LOVING PEDOPHILES. STOP YOUR MANIPULATION OF YOUR OIL PRICES. NO. LOWER YOUR OIL OR WE WILL ELSE. ANY AMERICAN WHO IS STUPID ENOUGH TO TAKE SIDES OF OPEC IS JUST THAT!  AND LOSE YOUR LUST, RAPE OF CHILDREN.  LIKE THE Clinton Murder Inc./Foundations.

3896 2018-09-20 17:06:07 DUDE MY ROOMMATE WAS TRYINA SAY THAT FOR REAL and I was like my dude...I bought this at the store...down the street...the cops go to that same store to buy cigarettes and CBD oil
3897 2018-09-20 17:06:01 There is no documentation of oil debt. ye bas hawai baat hai its a myth
3898 2018-09-20 17:05:58 I see , you put who in his place, I can see Mr place putter, reason why you still so obsessed with me.
3899 2018-09-20 17:05:57 But how much of Brent US  is producing 0 & how much of WTI? Spread is increasing so Trump hasn't made great advantages to US oil Co but North Sea oil producing countries.
3900 2018-09-20 17:05:46 It’s all about oil market share that US wants to dominate& control by cutting down OPEC production & pushing up its own shale production. By the way Trump may not be interested in Shell which is a Dutch company.
3901 2018-09-20 17:05:44 Donnie talked oil with the polish President yesteday. Now he thinls he's an expert. #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica
3902 2018-09-20 17:05:39 Very bitter person. We should take him to southern twitter 
3903 2018-09-20 17:05:31 Stop insulting people that don’t agree with your opinion. If you like take the advice or live in ignorance.
3904 2018-09-20 17:05:23 waitttt i’m changing my oil rn
3905 2018-09-20 17:05:16 Great job! Does that mean you and your family are laundering more money for the Russians and their interests?
3906 2018-09-20 17:05:15 now I agree with everything you say ..you see i have my play account..Eddie has the main big share dealing account. I have learnt that I have low patience and must learn this discipline. I have been trading a few. Now Eddie, will go with your strategy....there I have been honest.
3907 2018-09-20 17:05:10 So why would you be trolling? I guess you don't know how to read technical charts!!!! So funny, a troll who has no idea what is going on in the oil markets. Your loss, my gain, haha haha haha
3908 2018-09-20 17:05:08 The interest rates are unreasonably high, often countries reimburse debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.
3909 2018-09-20 17:05:07 organs: hey this is good, but could we get some fruits or veg---
me: korean bbq!
organs: maybe cut out the--
me: chili powder! :) nuclear sauce! :) salt and oil! :)
organs: maybe just drink a cup of water?
me: KOREAN :) BAR :) BE :) CUE :)
3910 2018-09-20 17:05:04 Then can we assume without the returns from those regions, we wouldn’t have been exploring the oil?
3911 2018-09-20 17:05:01 I don’t know who’s daughter needs to hear this but...

get an oil change

3915 2018-09-20 17:04:47 Exactly. That was how he came me sometime back but I put him in his place. It’s high time he uses his brain. He is always under a post insulting people for no reason.
3916 2018-09-20 17:04:46 @BingingWBabish With regards to your latest Basics vid: does the cutting board maintenance carry over to bamboo boards in similar fashion? I can't afford a nice Boos block, sno I have a big ass bamboo block that I wash and oil regularly, but am I just wasting my time?
3917 2018-09-20 17:04:43 My 72-year old father in law was very upset after riding in my PM3 @Tesla.  He couldn’t believe that this tech didn’t come to market sooner!  He blamed the oil/auto industry.  Glad @elonmusk had the vision to take on the most powerful industries in the world!

3920 2018-09-20 17:04:33 #GrumpyOldMan:  One thing that would help lower oil prices would be to reinstate the fuel standards that you wiped out earlier in your administration.  If we don't buy so much oil, they no longer hold a gun to our head.  But you seemed to have missed that point.
3921 2018-09-20 17:04:31 simple cleansing oil tu berapa? dh ada org beli?
3922 2018-09-20 17:04:31 You need low oil prices although you are the biggest producer  very strange!!!

3924 2018-09-20 17:04:22 I went for Maui range instead but bought the cgx curl milk and hydrating coconut oil spray today! Hoping it’ll help keep my hair healthier than it was before 
3925 2018-09-20 17:04:22 1. On prices: Iran production will be off over 1m barrels a day because of US unilaterally pulling out of nuclear deal. 

2. On OPEC “monopoly”: US now world’s single largest oil producer.

3931 2018-09-20 17:03:57 I work in the Oil & gas industry in Texas where a lot of Hispanic people work and enjoying the Trump economy. Easy vote...food stamps from Democrats or new cars, houses, and money to spend for kids under Trump. Jobs..jobs...jobs.

3939 2018-09-20 17:03:22 I'm sure American oil producers are very happy that you want to lower the price of oil.

3941 2018-09-20 17:03:06 In most Toyotas, PCV breathers should either be replaced every 20,000 miles or once a year as a preventative measure. The breather protects the engine by preventing the oil breakdown and sludge buildup that’s a natural byproduct of combustion engines.

3944 2018-09-20 17:02:39 WTI crude was over $75 in July; under $70 now. Doug Ford can't affect international  oil prices any more than he can affect interest rates set by the bank of Canada.

3955 2018-09-20 17:01:59 Few days back I shared an article which destroyed this myth of debt. If you want I can share again and yes that person is a well qualified oil expert and researcher.
3956 2018-09-20 17:01:58 HEY SHITLER! TEXAS AND OTHER AMERICAN STATES PRODUCE OIL TOO. 
So what you're saying is, I want to hurt those oil-producing states.
BETTER -- SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY! Oh, but that was an Obama policy and you're busy destroying as much as possible rather than doing good.
3957 2018-09-20 17:01:56 A classic Ponzi scheme or a snake oil salesman's pitch? We'll take your money have middle men take their profit to process the money and then give you bake more that we took . And I have a bridge I can sell you too.
3958 2018-09-20 17:01:53 Really? Renewable energy isn't nearly as efficient as oil. It certainly sounds better in legislation, but its not a realistic alternative. The best thing we can do is move to an actually usable source of energy, like nuclear power.
3959 2018-09-20 17:01:51 INDIA CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR CRUDE OIL EITHER THROUGH ONE LAKH TON CARGO SHIP OR UNDER SEA PIPELINE.

3964 2018-09-20 17:01:37 I misread the label on a bottle of essential oil (peppermint) as “existential oil,” which tells you everything about my mental state right now
3965 2018-09-20 17:01:08 Saudi pledge of making Oil City at Gawadar is win- win for all three. It will align S.A in strategic partnership besides reducing distance of Chinese oil exports from 12000 KM to mere 5000. US $ 10 B investment will give boost to our Forex Reserves & employment opportunities.
3966 2018-09-20 17:01:03 I had thc in my oil, its the reason it worked so well. It was not just a CBD oil.. it was a whole plant cannabis oil.

3968 2018-09-20 17:00:59 Last time on 20th April 2018 @realDonaldTrump criticised on high oil prices when Brent it was around 73. But after that Brent rallied to 81...!!!

3977 2018-09-20 17:00:43 Myth:  Refineries care about the ethical ranking of crude oil.
Reality:  Refineries are a business and buy the cheapest feed stock available.

3981 2018-09-20 17:00:23 ... and the oil price went down.

3983 2018-09-20 17:00:22 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
3984 2018-09-20 17:00:18 #WeDontBelieveYou They are doing this because you, unlike President Obama, are not strangling Russia's ability to sell oil on the world market and have no idea how to maintain being the world's #1 oil/gas exporter. SAD!

3985 2018-09-20 17:00:15 Lmao. He is always fun of doing that. I think there are more appropriate way of disagreeing with opinions rather than insults.
3986 2018-09-20 17:00:09 A lot of it probably had to do with his hair hanging in his face. Oil from the hair can cause bad breakouts on the forehead.

3988 2018-09-20 17:00:00 “Marine oil spill response is always evolving because everyone is trying to improve things.” – Dr. Heather Dettman. See our full interview with Dr. Dettman to learn more about her work studying the behaviour of oil spilled in water environments. #marinesafety #oilspill
3989 2018-09-20 16:59:58 Hahaha I bet it won't be turning for a while either  it's 62 degrees here and going down to 48 at night and my coconut oil is rock solid 
3990 2018-09-20 16:59:50 인제 자야지
3991 2018-09-20 16:59:48 Instead of you to say something reconciliatory ,but you choose to leverage on this to insult me, its none of your business, you can find your way out if u don't have anything positive to contribute.
3992 2018-09-20 16:59:43 He’s both right and so wrong at the same time lol. Without our security guarantee, oil would also be much much higher 
3993 2018-09-20 16:59:41 โอ้ยยยย น่ารักกกก
3994 2018-09-20 16:59:41 My understanding is that everything West of the Ottawa River is largely Canadian oil, and East of the Ottawa River is Middle-East oil.
3995 2018-09-20 16:59:35 I disagree with all the subsidies that go to oil companies which are supported by dems and reps alike. You don’t have to wait any longer.
3996 2018-09-20 16:59:29 The last 6 Presidents all Talked about being dependent oil free from Middle East. All BS to please there Base but way too much $$$ to Candidates from the Middle East Oil Cartel!

3999 2018-09-20 16:59:14 My daddy still be calling to tell me get an oil change

4001 2018-09-20 16:59:07 SIR ALSO THINK OF ALL PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING THAT  IS WHAT YOU ARE IMPORTING FROM CHINA.

YOUR  ECONOMY AND SELF SUFFICIENCY  IS DRAINING DUE TO THESE IMPORTS.

START  PRODUCING MORE CRUDE OIL FROM TEXAS AND SELL IT MOST TO CRUDE OIL HUNGRY COUNTRY LIKE INDIA.
4002 2018-09-20 16:59:07 อร๊ายยย สีสวยยยย
4003 2018-09-20 16:59:05 Trump will be more interested to see ExxonMobil and Chevron Texaco, which are American, rather than Shell, which is a Dutch company. And yes, at current Crude price, even Shale oil through fracking, where US is expert can be too attractive
4004 2018-09-20 16:59:05 Wrong on this one Andy.

The money went into the profits and expansion of big oil and support organisations.some if course was taken in taxes and given back by way of reductions in corporation tax.
4005 2018-09-20 16:58:57 My roommates are always looking out, because ever since I've felt sick they've been giving me tea and medicine, and since I broke out like crazy all of a sudden one of them bought me this oil that tarte makes and my face cleared up, they are the best. 
4006 2018-09-20 16:58:53 anyone try CBD oil for puking?
4007 2018-09-20 16:58:50 마피아 자주 걸리면 좋은 점:맘에 안 들면 죽일 수 있음
4008 2018-09-20 16:58:46 Snake oil, like K-tape.
4009 2018-09-20 16:58:41 I see this as a political expression due to the barrels of oil..interesting choice & could have sparked a much needed debate on the topic, if that's what the artist had intended.

But in the true nature of an artist, the piece is what you make of it :)
4010 2018-09-20 16:58:39 Hi, hope you're well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy.  This treatment defies science. When would you like me at your service. Thank you
4011 2018-09-20 16:58:34 Trump just complained about increasing oil prices.
4012 2018-09-20 16:58:24 You are focussing only USA, rest of other countries depending middle east oil wells... Crude & water demand never will come down, now itvis yime for cycle change for crude & gold which will start for upmove for next two years, equity market will fall l slowly . lets watch
4013 2018-09-20 16:58:23 2 ค่ะ
4014 2018-09-20 16:58:21 Since 3 hours now I've been waiting for this oil or gas tanker to come and still... I'm getting fedup.. I want to be the first to report this "prophetic" news 
Eagle Prophet won't it happen anymore??
4015 2018-09-20 16:58:14 Frustrating to keep seeing this constant reference in articles about Iran’s crude oil exports being down SO MUCH since April; which was a recent record month.

THEY SHIPPED FROM STORAGE, FFS!!

If you’re going to use a reference number, then use the annual average instead. #OOTT
4016 2018-09-20 16:58:02 Hola In there's. If OPEC prices come down, won't that put oil workers out of a job?
4017 2018-09-20 16:57:55 Also: the primary reason oil prices rose FOR THE US, is because YOU pissed off the Iranian government!
4018 2018-09-20 16:57:46 @CBCOntarioToday Rita, there’s a glut of oil on the market. That plays a part in gas prices! Please enlighten your audience, thanks.
4019 2018-09-20 16:57:38 From SSs interview the other week he was all for 2019 production. 100 per cent have to hold until the first year results (or even half) nest year. As he also said, commercial turns them from an exploration company into an oil one! Def exciting
4020 2018-09-20 16:57:37 It seems ridiculous cereal companies, sofa companies are chastised for targeting kids, but vape oil companies fly under the radar! @hmattsdad
4021 2018-09-20 16:57:30 First Impression: Had a little stiffness in my neck, saw advertisement on my 'Smart Phone' for an automated chiropractor, with low cost and immediate availability, convenient location, polite auto-attendant, brand new facility, smelled of antiseptic pine oil, what could go wrong?
4022 2018-09-20 16:57:18 Fossil fuels have been PAST PEAK production since 1976.

Saying "We're #1 OIL" is like  bragging abt Model-T Fords.

Think #THORIUM molten salt SAFE nuclear energy that is 92% more efficient than steam cooled plutonium - PLUS it renders old plut-waste inert
4023 2018-09-20 16:57:11 Girl needs to worry less about Mariah and more about dry shampooing that greasy ass hair.... girl looking like she gets canola oil blow drys.
4024 2018-09-20 16:57:05 Boleh je asalkan dia pure oil :)
4025 2018-09-20 16:56:58 That is not necessarily true since building the pipeline will decrease the number of tankers on the US side of marine border and reduce the number of oil-by-rail trains running along our rivers. There is a bigger picture you have chosen to ignore in your analysis.
4026 2018-09-20 16:56:53 my last oil change was done 7 months ago  my poor baby probably dying lowkey
4027 2018-09-20 16:56:45 What's the "proper" smell? "Car smell" to me is mainly motor oil and leather.
4028 2018-09-20 16:56:44 Ever since hurricane Katrina oil prices never came down. I support you President Trump 110% keep up the great job!
One Native American behind you!

4031 2018-09-20 16:56:35 Last time I checked the US was a net exporter of oil and benefitted from higher oul prices. Lower prices cost a lot of US oils employees their jobs.

4033 2018-09-20 16:56:19 water and oil
4034 2018-09-20 16:56:15 Toxins put in the ground to push out more oil is not good for our water and soil. Period.
4035 2018-09-20 16:56:14 Rather it happen now than mid-November
4036 2018-09-20 16:56:12 Russia needs to leave Syria now and mind their own business . Country is a total joke except for oil and nukes and rockets to the space station. Why they support Assad who is a vile of a human being is beyond me.

4038 2018-09-20 16:55:48 I feel like if I used coconut oil deodorant I'd spend a lot of time trying not to lick my underarms.
4039 2018-09-20 16:55:45 @savannahh36 when was the last time you got a oil change?
4040 2018-09-20 16:55:34 Yeah all this record low unemployment  and strong, broad based economic growth is a real downer...ffs

Know what one of the major problems in Venezuela is? Putting all their faith in the oil economy, just like the Conservatives want to do here.
4041 2018-09-20 16:55:34 A very smart move of embracing electric cars by an oil producing country.
4042 2018-09-20 16:55:27 The way crude related stocks have sold off... don't think oil is coming down sooner n y wud America want oil prices to come down...they themselves r pumping it big time n exporting
4043 2018-09-20 16:55:18 Hmmmm isn’t that why the Bushes went to war in the Middle East because of oil? Beware folks I see something brewing!
4044 2018-09-20 16:55:15 เยอะไปหมดอ่ะ
4045 2018-09-20 16:55:14 Agreed, it happens. Hate to see it though
4046 2018-09-20 16:55:05 Just imagine when all that oil money gets spent on something useful
4047 2018-09-20 16:55:01 So to beat E5 second boss: Hayasui (with 1 oil drum and kami tank), 4CV, Richelieu + Commandant teste (anti-installation setup), Bismarck, Prinz Eugen, 1 CL 2DD. All lbas to boss (1 fighter 3 bombers) Both support recommended, though only boss support seems mandatory #KanColle
4048 2018-09-20 16:54:56 XD i thought since i just started using coconut since like 2 days ago that it was just me not using my skin products recently and not that the oil was making it like that XD
4049 2018-09-20 16:54:52 no vegtable oil or anything?
4050 2018-09-20 16:54:52 To all those who believe this: i have some great snake oil i can sell you, supplies are limited, dm me.
4051 2018-09-20 16:54:48 Stop protecting, we have our own oil! We can't even get a wall built, and they are piling in here, like ants!!
4052 2018-09-20 16:54:32 The panel agrees: Taste and function must go hand in hand! Entrepreneurs like @HIVIBECHI take innovative ingredients w/ functional benefits like Oil of Oregano and make them taste delicious #Foodscape2 #foodtrends
4053 2018-09-20 16:54:28 Mechanics are paid flat rate, via the amount of work you do. If you have 50 people coming back every 3-5k for a $34 oil change you’re making your money
4054 2018-09-20 16:54:25 Quick oil change?
4055 2018-09-20 16:54:16 God help you Trump brother on the oil countries where Kuwait Bush Father want to burn America and Hurricane America, which destroyed the city of its potential and how will protect them the disappearance of America is still oil Arabs

4057 2018-09-20 16:54:10 Key drivers for energy markets through 2020: growth of global economy, growth of oil demand, sanctioning of large scale conventional projects, and the ability of producers to balance production growth with cash flows, says England. #DUGEagleFord
4058 2018-09-20 16:54:00 I have this snake oil to sell you, won't come cheap, but the benefits are infinite!
4059 2018-09-20 16:53:58 Sure thing. I just need to peddle my single-gear bike to the nearest car-sharing facility to signout a Prius. Then I will drive super-conscientiously to SoPo (so as not to murder any hapless squirrels) and pick you up. I need to stop and get some beard oil first, though.
4060 2018-09-20 16:53:55 I bet all high street stores stock products containing non--compliant Palm oil: Pork Pies @tesco @sainsburys @marksandspencer @aldi @lidl @coopukfood @waitrose Why is there any Palm oil in your pork pies.. etcetera etcetera etcetera; not a traditional, nor necessary, ingredient.
4061 2018-09-20 16:53:55 Oil City being made at #Gwadar now by Saudia Arabia under #CPEC is phenomenal boost to the economy for the stake holders. Let us hope for it's successful implementation.
4062 2018-09-20 16:53:50 Just makes the oil warmer so it’s less thick so isn’t as hard to inject and is quicker, nurse recommended it. I normally do it but not for very long so I held it right in my hands / rolled it around for a few minutes this time.
4063 2018-09-20 16:53:49 I would go with a few weeks too There will be alot of trading going on with the news. I think you could be here for a long time if you wanted with potential to expand this all the way to the Isle of Wight plus will other parties show interest.
Massive potential an very exciting.
4064 2018-09-20 16:53:48 Of course and free press to the oil crisis in Nigeria (ft. My tribe the Ogoni people).

They can literally dig into the culture. Like kind of a mixture of “Ph City Vibrations” and the “Aza” music video ya feel?
4065 2018-09-20 16:53:42 Nature of the beast with that position...
4066 2018-09-20 16:53:36 its actually the Oilies! as in oil
4067 2018-09-20 16:53:31 What kind of oil did you fry it in? Was it encased in batter? 
How many did you eat? 
What is the meaning of life? 
Why is the sky blue?

4070 2018-09-20 16:53:13 Get your man to do the oil change, don’t pay someone to do it, or just do it yourself!
4071 2018-09-20 16:53:09 That makes me think of critics’ assertion that no one is writing novels about oil, and I can think of three from CALGARY alone.
4072 2018-09-20 16:53:04 Kai mutumin banza ne.
4073 2018-09-20 16:53:03 I really, really, really want to learn how to pain the way Bob Ross does. Think I might get some oil paints and brushes for my birthday or Christmas.
4074 2018-09-20 16:53:00 America buys our oil not the other way around , what do you think the Keystone project was about. It wasn't supposed to flow oil into Alberta that's for sure. You don't even know what your talking about fake American
4075 2018-09-20 16:52:59 and in monthly oil production
4076 2018-09-20 16:52:46  last RT,  my mom and i are laughing so hard at the meme... The day that one came, he literally picked her up, put her on his lap and dropped her like she was hot oil inside a metal bowl  and he left immediately saying "I'll be back" 
4077 2018-09-20 16:52:33 Get some of the kind that comes with a rind, put a little oil on it, cover it in pepper and bake it for like ten minutes
4078 2018-09-20 16:52:29 So lets switch up to green energy dump the crude oil. #ImpeachTrumpNow #putinspuppet #embarrassment #worstpresidentever #trumpslostchildren #foxnewsisfakenews #TrumpCult #corruptGOP #complicitgop
4079 2018-09-20 16:52:26 cbd oil is made from hemp, thc oil is made from cannabis and is used on cancer patients and epilepsy u sausage, do a bit of research!!
4080 2018-09-20 16:52:26 Perhaps Trump should stop lower fuel economy standards, reducing renewable energy programs, and destabilizing the middle east. Oh, wait. Vladiimr Putin wants high oil prices. Russia sells a lot of oil. And the oil industry owns the @GOP No wonder. @TrumpIsPutinsPuppet
4081 2018-09-20 16:52:22 Hi, hope you're good. I provide a treatment named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you.  Thank you
4082 2018-09-20 16:52:21 2 years after Rajiv Gandhi left PM post, India had to pawn its gold shamefully, just to pay interest on huge loans of "socialism".
3 years after Sonia's UPA left power, India had to pay unpaid oil bonds, including Rs.70,000,00,00,000 of interest!

Scorched earth dynasty strategy?
4083 2018-09-20 16:52:19 Idk but we once tried a type of popcorn that you put in the microwave so you dont use oil or butter and it came out tasteless.
4084 2018-09-20 16:52:16 walang oil para mamasahe ko binti koooo aaaaaaahkkk 
4085 2018-09-20 16:52:13 YES, saltier and oilier, going strictly for the reduced fat ones now, not for dietary reasons but just less salt and oil and not a ripped up tongue
4086 2018-09-20 16:52:06 If I buy beard oil for 5k, I'd better be able to fry dodo with that oil too.
4087 2018-09-20 16:51:59 Y peores cosas vendrán...
4088 2018-09-20 16:51:55 @Jasmine_isaacc get an oil change
4089 2018-09-20 16:51:53 Dear respected Sir, India's biggest import is oil & gold, While India's total imports moved up from $185 billion in 2017 to $216 billion in 2018, oil was the biggest contributor as it moved from $38 billion to $58 billion. Need to change to EV urgently @narendramodi @NITIAayog
4090 2018-09-20 16:51:44 I do not want to get an oil change right now... I really want to get wingstop 
4091 2018-09-20 16:51:40 Mr. Trump

Your country USA caued
All trouble jr. Push uesd his mind
To start war In afganistan & Iraq

Reduce the price of your products
We will help to fill your tanker by oil
4092 2018-09-20 16:51:39 Peppermint oil has shown promise as an IBS treatment
4093 2018-09-20 16:51:38 Oil companies executives, what kind of bias?
4094 2018-09-20 16:51:31 Are you including the housing market in the financial system. If so, than I am not sure. People lost their houses because of their mortgages, not because they lost their jobs, and things got started from there. Also higher energy prices. Is oil part of the financial system?
4095 2018-09-20 16:51:26 Yes!!!!! We need to bring back things like home ec! Kids need to know skills that are important in life as well as book knowledge. How to change their oil, cook a meal, balance a checkbook. These things seem so simple, yet so many young people have no clue.
4096 2018-09-20 16:51:18 크으 역시 마피아 인싸 게임이라 모세의 기적 안 일어남
4097 2018-09-20 16:51:11 They are WAY more ecofriendly than anything burning oil products. Also, don't internal combustion engines, transmissions (gear boxes), mufflers, manifold, water pumps, oil pumps, fuel pumps and full gas tanks weigh anything?
4098 2018-09-20 16:51:08 All vitamins contain different things so the one you take can help. DHA is just found in fish oil which lots of people take. That won’t necessarily harm you but too much folic acid can have side effects as well as iron. Too much calcium in some prenatals can just make ur body
4099 2018-09-20 16:50:53 猫化むちゃくちゃかわいい、、しんどい、、、
4100 2018-09-20 16:50:43 Presently US is sitting on large oil stock and by imposing sanction on Iran and Venezuela oil is bound to rise. US will then step in to fill the void. Earlier when price collapsed many wells were abandoned as they turned non lucrative. Blowing hot and cold.
4101 2018-09-20 16:50:38 More proof that the EPA is also a puppet to Big Oil.
4102 2018-09-20 16:50:37 Сейчас идёт онгоингом манга Нулевой Эдем. Пока только по-моему одиннадцать глав. Это от автора Хвоста Феи — Хиро Машимы. На удивление, довольно годное произведение. Киберпанк, фантастика, фэнтези, этти, сёнен, приключения.
4103 2018-09-20 16:50:32 I feel this statement is from Rex disingenuous. Many people that suport the oil and gas industry have been standing up and saying something for a very long time.
4104 2018-09-20 16:50:29 Bullshit. WTI was over $75 in July; under $70 now. Ford can't affect international oil prices any more than he can affect interest rates set by the bank of Canada. No matter how many times you tell the stupid people that voted for you ridiculous clowns to the contrary. #cdnpoli

4107 2018-09-20 16:50:20 And you think you've made sense with this tweet? I'll need ans
-Was it PMB that depleted our foreign reserves?
-Was it PMB that made our economy to be oil dependent?
-Was it PMB dat prevented Nigeria from saving during the oil boom?
-Was it PMB dat caused the oil prices to slump?
4108 2018-09-20 16:50:16 Doesn’t that just mean you change the brand of oil you put in your vehicle?
4109 2018-09-20 16:50:14 Wow same, idk the last time I got an oil change

4113 2018-09-20 16:50:05 Based on the info coming from Fear, it’s evident you know how diplomacy works. We protect them because it gives us a presence in the region. That presence is in our national interest. We can afford some oil price gouging - price for our presence.
4114 2018-09-20 16:50:04 Kernel oil, or cashew nuts oil .
4115 2018-09-20 16:49:59 Why exporting oil seeds whilst we import oil, Senseless
4116 2018-09-20 16:49:59 At last. Actually at present what what things happened, like de-valuation of money (INR),  Oil price, fiscal deficit. Al those I have  told 1 & half years ago. As a common people expect this what I can do. This country's leaders are almighty.
4117 2018-09-20 16:49:44 Considering Texas has more oil than the Middle East, there’s nothing that can dissipate the boom

4123 2018-09-20 16:49:08 Put eye comfort on phone.  Don't watch TV before bed.  Have lavender essential oil in a diffuser or humidifier at night (reduces snoring and helps sleep).  Blackout curtains and no device before sleep.  Tea with hops and vallerium root help too.

4129 2018-09-20 16:48:37 Careful - your boss likes higher oil prices also!
4130 2018-09-20 16:48:32 Pranab da had Global Recession, High Crude Oil prices of 120+ to handle but Jaitlie made a mess of economy when crude dipped below 40 and world markets were excelling. So its unfair to compare the 2
4131 2018-09-20 16:48:32 Очень красивая рисовка в вебке Плач Сирены, само повествование тоже очень хорошее. Это романтика, любовный треугольник и мистика.
Но также я очень люблю рисовку Обещанный Неверленд. Дети-гении, сёнен, мистика, драма. Очень рекомендую.
4132 2018-09-20 16:48:26 So my sewing machine broke and only god knows how heart broken it is to see my machine with no backtrack handle with leaking oil. Fuck the movers renting boys fuck yall! Pay me a new machine 
4133 2018-09-20 16:48:20 Obviously the lawyer is unfamiliar with how much flower it takes to make enough cannabis oil for a cancer patient. Even 6 pounds may not be enough if the potency is low. The lawyer is likely operating on the false assumption that the only way to consume flower is to smoke it.
4134 2018-09-20 16:48:09 Normally Palm Springs smells like sun tan oil & Rose....today, there's a hint of pork belly in the air, hahahaha.  Have fun!

4139 2018-09-20 16:47:32 Note to self: when seasoning your cast iron pan, DO NOT put the pan on the electric burn, add the oil, turn the burner on hight then go sit and talk to your husband who just came home from work. You might end up with a super heated pan that is actually stuck to the burner.  
4140 2018-09-20 16:47:29 Does anyone have a popcorn maker that only uses air?

Is it true that the popcorn it makes tastes really bland because it has no oil?
4141 2018-09-20 16:47:29 Don't be confused by the name of this organization "Protect Colorado." Vote yes on the ballot initiative to limit oil and gas drilling within 2500 ff of homes, business and green spaces. Let's continue to create jobs in CO w/ innovative energy sources, as well as wind and solar.

4144 2018-09-20 16:46:55 They have made millions on all of them us - look at Dubai!!! Oil is paying for it!!!
4145 2018-09-20 16:46:50    Extra virgin olive oil helps contain anti-aging agents, and nutrients that fight osteoporosis and skin damage. Apparently, olive oil adds a protective layer on the skin, both through consumption and application #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #oliveoil #huiledolive

4151 2018-09-20 16:46:25 Venezuela oil fields are so dilapidated that they hardly produce anything

4153 2018-09-20 16:46:20 What are you doing about the oil spill near NOLA reported by the advocate  yesterday sept 19? These are massive failures, damages polluting our waters & seafood industry! What are you doing about this? Are you involved? Please expound!!

4158 2018-09-20 16:45:57 That's right get them oil prices down. I have an idea let's switch over to that Zero Point Energy. You know what I'm talking about that same energy that the secret space force is using. Boy that would stall out Petros big engine. By the way I don't drink Kool-Aid. LOL
4159 2018-09-20 16:45:42 THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW!!! I HAVE MY SKIN PRODUCTS AT MY MOMS PLACE AND I'LL STOP USING COCONUT OIL

4161 2018-09-20 16:45:38 My car was blinking for an oil change for like 6 months. It broke down and my brother pushed it to an autozone. They changed my oil for free 
4162 2018-09-20 16:45:23  you tried to be healthy and have a treat at the same time! Actually if u had salad with  , the fibre in the lettuce absorbs the saturated oil in the  its a win win situation!
4163 2018-09-20 16:45:22 I’d really consider giving up most dairy products if some vegan options weren’t SO unhealthy. Like vegan mayo is straight up oil and is likely just as unhealthy as non-vegan mayo.
4164 2018-09-20 16:45:14 People are so nice to you when your pregnant. I got a free oil change today hehe

4166 2018-09-20 16:45:08 Hi, hope you're well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you.
4167 2018-09-20 16:45:08 Wow, finally providing life-saving service for citizens on american soil instead of life-taking  service for oil companies and big pharma on foreign soil. What a concept. A group of soldiers to whom I can actually say "Thank you for your service." In good conscience, and mean it.
4168 2018-09-20 16:44:57 Warm shower or bath before bed with some lavender or ylang ylang oil. My wife got me into this 
4169 2018-09-20 16:44:41 How do you explain the gas price hikes and drops that happened before without the presence of a carbon tax?  Seems the oil companies manipulate the price of gas at their own free will.
4170 2018-09-20 16:44:37 What about “oil money”? #SolarPower
4171 2018-09-20 16:44:36 Should have only been $75 for a synthetic oil change, tire rotation, and a top off of all other fluids
4172 2018-09-20 16:44:34 my mum cooks in a way which she thinks is healthy :(( she uses too much oil and make portions way too big (this ain’t my ed speaking - my dad literally eats for 4 people djdj)
4173 2018-09-20 16:44:32 US has started to revisit decision of cutting Pakistan's aid. Saudis have agreed to be part of #CPEC & build 'Oil City' in Gawadar. UAE has agreed to invest in #Pakistan after 5 years. India & Afghans are ready to restore peace talks. All this in the first month of Naya Pakistan.
4174 2018-09-20 16:44:29 Actually he's unfit to handle anything except being a no 1  oil salesman
4175 2018-09-20 16:44:25 Did you know that Monsanto was bought by Bayer who was once IG Farben who was the industrial power house of the Nazi party. Were responsible for factories at the concentration camps that were built with American engineers from Standard oil and ford
4176 2018-09-20 16:44:23 P.s. you need more than just oil lol you need and oil filter too and might as well change that air filter while your at it!
4177 2018-09-20 16:44:14 How about we reduce our oil dependency and move towards wind and solar and we won't have this problem
4178 2018-09-20 16:44:14 Is there enough oil money left to buy new fans? I mean the camera pans round the new facilities and then they interview some half bred missing half their teeth and suddenly the Amazon doc needs subtitles?
4179 2018-09-20 16:44:06 You got oil change money? Alright then
4180 2018-09-20 16:44:05 This from the King of financial spitballing, said Trump would create a stock market rout, How did he get a Nobel prize, snake oil salesman has never been right in any of his economic forecasts

4190 2018-09-20 16:43:10 Mike is an idiot who knows nothing about what he’s posting about. He’s just a rabble rouser who sees YouTube videos made by people with a hidden agenda... like US oil companies who use trolls like Mike to try to get Canadian oil for less money. It worked, again.
4191 2018-09-20 16:43:08 Gotta go get oil change and car wash let me get up and get my day started
4192 2018-09-20 16:43:06 thank u wow I’m literally gonna get an oil change after class
4193 2018-09-20 16:43:01 If you still think putting a tax on crude oil is going to 'save the environment' you need to do some independent research and start thinking for yourself.
4194 2018-09-20 16:42:54 Если честно, то вообще не шарю по жанрам..
Просто что покорило больше всего или где рисовка понравилась больше всех?
4195 2018-09-20 16:42:52 Exactly. For good reason war can be necessary but still bad for all. But to go to war to benefit Esso oil in Vietnam. That’s what it was all about. Fucking money. Vietnam wanted to keep their own oil but esso wouldn’t let them. It was France who was there befor us
4196 2018-09-20 16:42:46 Abayoo, castor oil isn’t an essential oil  I’m talking about: Lavender, Tea tree, eucalyptus, lemon, sweet orange, patchouli etc that come in 10ml bottles because they’re concentrated
4197 2018-09-20 16:42:44 I forgot to tell y’all i changed my oil.

Claims high oil prices are good for consumers. 
Wtf ?
4204 2018-09-20 16:42:25 You don't know a damn thing about cars if you're suggesting using conventional oil for 7,500 miles.....those will be your last 7,500 miles
4205 2018-09-20 16:42:18 Haha, thanks! That’s a real conpliment. It’s really weird but it’s a banana bread sorta thing but with oil, and on the bottom there’s like a walnut and honey crumb sorta thing which might not be really crumby, and the drizzle is coffee!

4217 2018-09-20 16:40:49 @realDonaldTrump No one can deceive people; Iran's oil exports should be completely cut off by November 4, and Iran can not even export a barrel of oil. We stood firm and the people were with us to finish the work of this criminal regime
4218 2018-09-20 16:40:48 Ain’t shit happening at work so I went and got an oil change on the clock 
4219 2018-09-20 16:40:45 Me and u are not the same , I shave my pussy with coconut oil.

4226 2018-09-20 16:39:59 I wish we could come together as a planet and agree to stop the use of palm oil.

4228 2018-09-20 16:39:43 Quite an admission from the NY Slime..

NY Slimes editor Clifford Krauss writes...President Donald Trump's oil sanctions on Iran are effectively weakening the regime's leverage as oil companies across the globe bail out of deals with Iran.....
4229 2018-09-20 16:39:40 I’d never bought any until earlier this year, just had normal Sennhesiers. 

Bought Bose as their aviation headsets even manage to drown out the whisky bit above, oil leak at the back, and terrified screams from pax.  Must be good.
4230 2018-09-20 16:39:35 Deja chu

Always heard that in market people have short memory. But so short...???
20th April'18 Donald Trump criticized OPEC for high oil prices when Brent crude was at $74/bbl. After that comment crude went above $80/bbl in 1 month. And again we all expecting correction. Phew.
4231 2018-09-20 16:39:30 Did the US oil companies pay you to help stop this pipeline too (stopping it made Alberta’s oil mug cheaper for them). It also means that the heavily populated coastal areas have to get their oil now from the Saudis BY BOAT!
Congrats, you’re a puppet who made things worse!

4238 2018-09-20 16:38:43 The steep rise in price after the the 2nd Gulf War and resulting higher prices made exploiting shale and tar sand oil feasible. The more jaded among us might say that rise in price was a major factor in the US starting that war and not securing Iraq afterwords.
4239 2018-09-20 16:38:41 So what is the EPA so adamant about cutting back regulations that protect air quality & slow down things that cause climate change if the oil companies are now investing in sustainable energy? Big Oil knows their days are numbered & they started switching courses years ago.
4240 2018-09-20 16:38:40 YES IT IS A GRAPH AND YOU DO KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE GAS THEY HAVE TO HAVE OIL RIGHT?
4241 2018-09-20 16:38:22 Nice try, sir. But I think we all understand how your patron feels about oil prices. They are up quite a bit since inauguration. Worth whatever he spent ratf**king the election.
4242 2018-09-20 16:38:12 idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but it's time for u get an oil change
4243 2018-09-20 16:37:54 Have you seen YGYI today?  Nutritional products and coffee company that added a few hemp oil products to its line....up 33% today.  The speculation is at a fever pitch in this sector.
4244 2018-09-20 16:37:46 My bougie ass is not gonna survive at uni. Everyone will be there like “beans on toast ;) :)” and imma be there cooking gnocchi in olive oil wondering where my moneys gone
4245 2018-09-20 16:37:42 repeal the law that allows the sale of US oil to foreign countries...domestic production for domestic use only
4246 2018-09-20 16:37:41 Did the US oil companies pay you to help stop this pipeline (stopping it made Alberta’s oil mug cheaper for them). It also means that the heavily populated coastal areas have to get their oil now from the Saudis... BY BOAT!

Congrats, you’re a puppet who made things worse!

4247 2018-09-20 16:37:39 Hi hope you are all well. I run a successful business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. When can I be at your service. You will be pleasantly shocked. Tweet tweet please......
4248 2018-09-20 16:37:34  yam and red oil
4249 2018-09-20 16:37:29 Shale oil in Nebraska will break OPEC.
4250 2018-09-20 16:37:25 And let's not forget BIG CHEMICAL, AS WELL AS BIG OIL!  They OWN Louisiana, and bury the Congressional delegation and the state legislature in $$$money to maintain ownership!  So much for Louisiana: judged the worst state in the union by U.S. News.
4251 2018-09-20 16:36:52 Oil & gas reserves in eastern Syria & protection of Israel's future in light of the emergence of serious threats to its existence, two main reasons that lure the US into taking the lead role in attempting at regime change in Syria.
4252 2018-09-20 16:36:41 my mom has the oil so i just need a country boy to come get her done
4253 2018-09-20 16:36:37 広島ついたー
4254 2018-09-20 16:36:36 Gas: hundreds of years worth available.
Oil: (inc shale) more prospected now than there's ever been. Peak oil is a myth. 
Nuclear: Thorium is exceptionally abundant. Not developed by now only as it wouldn't produce the weapons grade material the US military wanted
4255 2018-09-20 16:36:35 العبيد سيخفضون الأسعار حالاً، وإلا....
The f)&@“>€ slaves will reduce oil prices NOW, otherwise.,,,,,,
4256 2018-09-20 16:36:32 They're also opposed to the Shetland, Orkney and Western Isles having a say on whether they would remain Scottish or an overseas British territory because then they'd lose that oil, despite it being a tad hypocritical.
4257 2018-09-20 16:36:31 New brakes, rotors, tires and got an oil change. my car feels beautiful but my bank account is HURT
4258 2018-09-20 16:36:30 @narendramodi @NITIAayog  Respected dear Sir, I humbly request you to urgently bring up E- mobility rules & EV policy for better & stronger India. We import so much of crude oil that our economy is susceptible on oil price.
Pollution is killing our health & future generations
4259 2018-09-20 16:36:28 American oil output has more than doubled over the last 10 years and we have now displaced Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer.

WAIT! That would have happened under President @BarackObama's terms in office. hmmmdon't tell anyone let's enjoy this
4260 2018-09-20 16:36:20 Transformational?!? This is according to the traders/rampers and #ANGS’s dodgy BoD! This company is a traders dream come true! The oil will flow only for a 5-6 days only to decline rapidly! See Lidsey & BB results for instance!
#ANGS is a scam!
4261 2018-09-20 16:36:18 Please President Trump do something about the rising oil prices.  You are our only hope against the evil OPEC!
4262 2018-09-20 16:36:13 Olive oil based dressing? That ish will get ya!
4263 2018-09-20 16:36:10 He’s talking bollocks. North Sea oil and gas shipped directly from the source is not currently regarded as Scottish revenue, according to the UK treasury. This money would go straight to the Scottish treasury after we declare independence. This is why they’re shiting themselves
4264 2018-09-20 16:35:55 Plot twist: my dad calls me and I answer with “you check your oil lately?”
4265 2018-09-20 16:35:55 Considering Grassley’s taste for Inquisitional style investigation, I would recommend the float test over boiling oil. Optics
4266 2018-09-20 16:35:55 From November, India will start paying Iran in Rupees for crude oil. Presently Indian refiners pay in Euros!
4267 2018-09-20 16:35:38 "Speaking of that boss, have I ever told you his 15 minute story about olive oil?"
4268 2018-09-20 16:35:31 Too few people give a shit about Muslims in a far away place and also because Western Economies are dependent upon Saudi oil
4269 2018-09-20 16:35:15 Pls go get an oil change
4270 2018-09-20 16:35:15 AMERICA SELL OIL ALSO
4271 2018-09-20 16:35:06 coconut oil is bad, it might even be causing some of ur clogged pores so be careful w it 
4272 2018-09-20 16:34:53 カマンベールチーズの芸術点高いって。。。
4273 2018-09-20 16:34:47 I remember I once took my Sister’s car and I was checking if it had gas. Tell me why her gas was at -180mi. She gon tell me it’s been like that because she didn’t put in oil for 5 months. You women don’t believe in oil or safety at all huh.
4274 2018-09-20 16:34:46 When i heard people talking about these airfryers i was thinking like it was some kind of deep fryer that would spread the oil into the air in the machine as small particles and would ''deep fry'' the food just with a small amount of oil. I guess i was wrong
4275 2018-09-20 16:34:44 My dear Marwat sahib. 
u r looking for samosas of 20th century in 21st century.
only few places left where you can get real chicken mutton or beaf. otherwise we dont know which meat is this and what kind of cooking oil and masalas are used. it is better to avoid.
4276 2018-09-20 16:34:44 คิดถึงจังเลยค่ะ 
4277 2018-09-20 16:34:40 How can Shri Ramdev babaji can   do this can he explain , and take over all oil firms in India and help the best to the citizens of our country.
4278 2018-09-20 16:34:39 Don’t be so sure, firstly the oil in Ontario is Middle Eastern (Saudi), and any drop reflects mkt pricing - take credit when it jumps too. Drive an EV, save from polluting your environment , Green Tech is $$$ profitable, and $$$ efficiencies are high for consumers in Ontario!
4279 2018-09-20 16:34:36 got this essential oil called breathe easy its a blend of eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, rosemary, cedar leaf, clove, pine, spearmint & anise & it clears my sinuses better than any vapor/nasal spray product I've ever used! never using Vicks again
4280 2018-09-20 16:34:33 Guarda che sono un fan di Bagnai e Borghi. E nel mio blog parlo da anni anche di peak oil e peak gold e anche peak debt in tutto il mondo ... storia lunga da riassumere. ... Comunque 'fanculo BCE ed Euro! 
4281 2018-09-20 16:34:31 Damn sis she got you on that one. Plus I got me oil changed AND my transmission fixed.
4282 2018-09-20 16:34:27 Hi David, we only use non-GMO Project Verified Expeller Pressed, Hexane Free Canola Oil.  We chose it because of its neutral taste, it's cholesterol & trans fat free, with the least saturated fat of any common cooking oil. We do appreciate your feedback, DM us with any questions!
4283 2018-09-20 16:34:20 The guys at Nissan are blasting music in my car while changing my oil and it’s the funniest shit I’ve seen
4284 2018-09-20 16:34:19 You better be changing your dang oil
4285 2018-09-20 16:34:18 Now imagine the most optimistic (or even dangerous) oil price scenarios...investment collapse/supply crunch theory+shale challenges+IMO sulphur regs+ another big outage and suddenly the amount of oil cash flying around Iraq could send usage to 30 GW quite quickly.
4286 2018-09-20 16:34:18 I love how my bf says oil, boil and wash/washer 
4287 2018-09-20 16:34:14 Sushi date?? I’m right next to you at the Nissan dealer ship getting my oil changed lmaoooo
4288 2018-09-20 16:34:04 Every disease is cured if you use coconut oil instead of any other oil.  God 
4289 2018-09-20 16:33:58 I will be on @HalftimeReport with @AnthonyGriz and @JackieDeAngelis talking crude oil @CNBCFuturesNow ..
4290 2018-09-20 16:33:56 I thought you said we were producing more oil than ever. What about keeping American  oil in America?
4291 2018-09-20 16:33:55 Sometimes leave in conditioners are almost too moisturizing and coats the hair so it takes a long time to dry and ends up doing the opposite of what it’s supposed to do and can make the hair greasy. Try rinsing well and using a light oil and dry it in.
4292 2018-09-20 16:33:55 Hi Goldie let me just correct you first. The gas price is down not because of Cap and trade but it is down because Oil Price is falling down at international market.
4293 2018-09-20 16:33:45 or we can put it this way... Why can't oil money create a winning European side?
4294 2018-09-20 16:33:41 Here we go again.  Youngevity Intl (YGYI), a nutritional products & coffee company, announces new hemp (not cannabis) oil products. YGYI up 33% today.  This is exactly what happened when companies added "Blockchain" to their name during bitcoin boom-bust. Speculation on steroids!
4295 2018-09-20 16:33:37 The guys doing my oil change are listening to the Spice Girls.
4296 2018-09-20 16:33:33 I need to get some coconut oil.
4297 2018-09-20 16:33:22 Some vegan food is really good. I love coffee and like coconut oil. 
The rest of it.... well each to their own but don't be so arrogant as to assume your worldview is perfect and everyone should accept it.
4298 2018-09-20 16:33:19 @POTUS Oil prices increase are the outcome of your self ill advised economical moves.
4299 2018-09-20 16:33:13 I use both! Back in Ae i would switch  to pad for Blanka and stick for Hakan ( forward small kick to oil slide was a pain). In sf5 same; pad for Fang but stick for Jimmy
4300 2018-09-20 16:33:08 To frack is to get oil or gas from rock by forcing liquid or sand into the rock.
4301 2018-09-20 16:33:05 Got an oil change and still made it to work on time 
4302 2018-09-20 16:32:54 I’m 950 miles overdue for an oil change lmao is that too much???
4303 2018-09-20 16:32:50 I am very happy to see that Army chief and Priminster are working as a team, PM has signed the oil city contract with Saudia in Gawadar and COAS made China agree on this Bravo now we are hopeful to see prosperous Pakistan @ImranKhanPTI @OfficialDGISPR
4304 2018-09-20 16:32:44 Thank goodness such shennanigans NEVER happen in oil and gas trading #OOTT
4305 2018-09-20 16:32:41 Then quit messing with coal and encourage oil production AND new refineries.
4306 2018-09-20 16:32:34 Tomorrow's Banner. He stood, his oil business and acting on the muddy pavement, contemptuous mouth, shut tight, exhibitionist

4314 2018-09-20 16:30:51 Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil  fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt  formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total.
4315 2018-09-20 16:30:37 You are also responsible for increasing oil price due to put sanction on Iran.
4316 2018-09-20 16:30:33 One thing I appreciate of my friends is that they keep me on top of my oil changes. That’s love, bitch.

4319 2018-09-20 16:30:25 After Hugo Chávez officially took office in February 1999, several policy changes  involving the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to  the state under his Bolivarian Revolution.
4320 2018-09-20 16:30:24 Im trying to switch to vaping. I bought a mod and some peach flavored oil. Just still kind of harsh.
4321 2018-09-20 16:30:16 dONT USE COCONUT OIL FOR UR FACE SKJDKSJD, if you want to use any natural oils stick with sweet almond oil or argan oil also rose water is amazing
4322 2018-09-20 16:30:13 i’m getting my oil change and i’m getting shuttled back to work and this is the most awkward ride 
4323 2018-09-20 16:30:08 So here's an idea, start pushing renewable energy so we dont oil....oh wait they contribute to you and Republicans
4324 2018-09-20 16:30:06 @HannahToyota so I got a oil change on 9/19/18 and when I got my car back my windshield was broke, which it wasn't when I brought it in. No one wants to get back to me on this? GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
4325 2018-09-20 16:30:04 MR president I strategically TOLD THEM TO KEEP OIL PRICES LOW FOR 5 YEARS IT WOULD HEAL ALL ECONOMISE! THERE IS A POLICY WHICH YOU DID TO OFFSET THIS FOR US ;MAYBE IT WAS MEANT TO BE???
4326 2018-09-20 16:29:56 I thought the US was the largest oil producer. Are we cutting prices?
4327 2018-09-20 16:29:54 My homie got a 99 Camry with 250,000 miles and all he do is get oil changes. That bitch ride like a Bentley
4328 2018-09-20 16:29:54 Yeah! Lets malign our alliances with a bordered-nation (Iran) that could provide essential energy sources via an oil pipeline+’security’, for a nation that is complicit in destabilizing Pakistan through their far-right, extreme, school of law , oh and funds.

4330 2018-09-20 16:29:41 I don't know a damn thing about oil. Thanks for the info
4331 2018-09-20 16:29:38 @MrFtrader You've got the X factor 
4332 2018-09-20 16:29:29 LMAO MOOD when I saw that tweet like “whoever’s daughter needs to see this get an oil change” bitch shut UP
4333 2018-09-20 16:29:25 I need to take my car in for an oil change but i just hate going to the mechanics
4334 2018-09-20 16:29:23 Vehicle imports account to the highest in value followed by oil. This has to be controlled and contained for the time being
4335 2018-09-20 16:29:22 It's amazing there's oil underneath all that....water?
4336 2018-09-20 16:29:17 When you spill your morning coffee over that millions of dollars contract agreement you are to submit to your boss in minutes.

Over on our side it will be oil spill from a heavy dose breakfast
4337 2018-09-20 16:29:14 EVs make more sense from a manufacturing perspective. Fewer parts smaller supply chain simpler to build. Comes down to economical source of electricity oil gas solar wind etc. Tide is already coming in. O&G need to figure out how to fit in
4338 2018-09-20 16:29:14 We shouldn't be dependent on oil. Past time to go green. Climate change is real and your saying otherwise is ludicrous.
4339 2018-09-20 16:29:12 Some good handles that can help. People you can trust and count on in times like this.

4341 2018-09-20 16:29:10 Of course the price of crude oil is rising because of (a) we as a world are using less!,eg,CILMATE change,and (b) people are not buying fuel demanding vehicles!,grow up you idiot we are in the 21st century!,where are you!!!

4344 2018-09-20 16:28:55 Your daily Gospel reflection...1/6

Thursday, September 20, 2018

LUKE 7:36-50
Friends, our Gospel today tells the story of a woman who—in the house of Simon the Pharisee-approaches Jesus, weeping onto his feet and anointing them with oil. One of the principal marks of Jesus’
4345 2018-09-20 16:28:41 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4346 2018-09-20 16:28:38 Also. Weed and cbd oil helps tbh. Plus yoga, meditation + practicing mindfulness
4347 2018-09-20 16:28:38 1. You don't understand what a monopoly is. 2. You don't understand what factora move oil prices (hint: your Iran sanctions). 3. Your desire for lower oil prices is indirect conflict with your promises to your base.

Oil prices ko daily need goods ki series me rakha jaye aur iska ek standard rate declare ho
4350 2018-09-20 16:28:24 Nicholas II was removed from the Russian throne because he selected Royal Dutch Shell to manage Russia's oil fields instead of JD Rockefeller's Standard Oil. Rockefeller paid Trotsky to lead the effort to remove Nicholas. Source: A. Sutton, Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution.
4351 2018-09-20 16:28:24 By your logic, it should be way more expensive now than a year ago, which isn’t the case, the cost of oil isn’t as volatile as you are making it to be. But it’s good that you learned and are using that new word you just pulled out of the dictionary.
4352 2018-09-20 16:27:59 Do you want to drive American oil producers out of business?
4353 2018-09-20 16:27:58 #ECO Biggest no brainer around but may not be around much longer - has just farmed out to a super major - TOT - in the hottest oil acreage on the planet - Guyana - proven oil
4354 2018-09-20 16:27:57 Why not try both? Cbd oil hasn't worked for me yet but only been a week of taking it. Kratom tastes awful but does work.
4355 2018-09-20 16:27:51 It’s okay my last oil change was February of 2017....
4356 2018-09-20 16:27:51 READ THE CHART! THEY SAID HE WASN’T TO BLAME BECAUSE IT WAS BUSH’S POLICIES THAT CAUSED THE OIL PRICES TO GO UP WHICH INTURN CAUSED GAS PRICES TO GO UP!
MACROECONOMICS SISTER! OIL AND GAS ARE COMPLIMENTS NOT SUBSTITUTES!
4357 2018-09-20 16:27:49 Usually get same thing but I went for a change today. I got mushrooms , onions, steak and jelapenos extra tommy base & chilli oil. Absolutely best pizzas !!!
4358 2018-09-20 16:27:49 I would have thought a bunch of ill hilltown junkies would be better convalescing amongst themselves. The special forces deployed to Iraq have better things to worry about, such as unemployment now that oil is quickly becoming a redundant fuel source.
4359 2018-09-20 16:27:44 Is this a joke? The #TrudeauLiberals and the environmental minister campaigning on reducing use of plastics while increasing production in the tarsands of the dirtiest oil on earth from which plastics are made AND increasing #fossilfuelibdustry subsidies. #hypocrites #cdnpoli
4360 2018-09-20 16:27:38 Shut up whore im bout to get this oil change and then ima hit you
4361 2018-09-20 16:27:33 눈섭 굵은 여자 거시기는 뭐지 파워 보지인건가
4362 2018-09-20 16:27:28 Le gas oil et l'essence sont l'unique source de pollution, il faut de l'imagination et de la fierté pour le déclarer.
Une rue plus loin, on pense autrement. 
Un peu d #ISF, de #flattax pour financer ça ruisselerait optimalement! #macron #pollution
4363 2018-09-20 16:27:21 oh god i bet it's one of those horrible oil furnaces with the tank in the basement. i had one of those once and it was the WORST
4364 2018-09-20 16:27:12 Gotta get an oil change, new brakes and my tires rotated tomorrow 
4365 2018-09-20 16:26:59 When the oil taste like  I’m a happy camper
4366 2018-09-20 16:26:54 지인들이랑 마퍄 해보고 싶다 흠
4367 2018-09-20 16:26:52 Jesus spelled backwards is Susej! Like Sausage! COINCIDENCE?  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4368 2018-09-20 16:26:48 Vote red and you're voting for oil, gas, coal, and weapons. Vote blue and you're voting for green tech, silicon valley, and...I don't know. Paper straw companies I guess.
4369 2018-09-20 16:26:30 Let them charge higher prices. 
Only backwards thinking people think that oil is the answer.
4370 2018-09-20 16:26:29 Pag babad sa ng coconut oil before pa hair color hehehe less damage
4371 2018-09-20 16:26:24 I’d say yes, both soaps have the same base, the only difference is the essential oil used but both essential oils (lemongrass & Rose) have properties that fight acne and help tone the skin.
4372 2018-09-20 16:26:18 Snake oil, you're trying to sell it.
4373 2018-09-20 16:26:14 When going to get an oil change turns into an oil change and new rotors. 
4374 2018-09-20 16:26:13 Anything that has to do with oil change I think about you 
4375 2018-09-20 16:26:09 DH worked for decades at a major oil and chemical company. I got this lecture every time friends questioned him (challenged him) on the big, bad oil business. I hope it informed them. I hope ~you~ inform them.
4376 2018-09-20 16:26:04 Yep, the Tahoes/Suburbans had designed defects in the oil pan return to secretly burn up oil and cause engine failure just outside the 100k mile warranty. Crooked as all hell!
4377 2018-09-20 16:26:01 Anyone who doesn't consider THIS heaven should indeed be boiled in the hell oil. 
Dogs are awesome.
4378 2018-09-20 16:26:00 opec sets the price on oil and it.s not going down.California has to deal with opec and our governor who put a large tax on our gas.Most people like me have parked our cars we can't afford the gas
4379 2018-09-20 16:25:51 That was my suggestion lmaooo naw but this oil called wild growth

4381 2018-09-20 16:25:47 Diverting a fraction of our Defense budget into getting our butts off oil?
4382 2018-09-20 16:25:41 The reduction in oil prices is directly related to the wedding ceremony of RAGA... Ask him to announce the same before being called Sathia gya... Ek aur...
4383 2018-09-20 16:25:41 He pulled out of Iran nuclear deal that will aid increase in oil prices and now in turn he is crying that other oil producers shld ramp up 2 make the shortfall! Nt hard 2 figure out who is responsible for this. like potus the oil prices will continue 2 be volatile.
4384 2018-09-20 16:25:40 getting out the shower putting coconut oil on ya body is a must 
4385 2018-09-20 16:25:37 "The law firm retained by the Saudis to defend them against the 9-11 families is Baker Botts (James Baker is the Bush family consigliere). And oil is the black glue connecting all these dots. Bushes profited from a relationship with a foreign power implicated in the 9/11 attacks.
4386 2018-09-20 16:25:34 No it is not about oil clown, it is about a narco regime that is destroying a country, it is about a narcocommunist regime trying to kill all venezuelans, lack of food, lack of medicines
4387 2018-09-20 16:25:34 that and high density housing built out of low carbon materials, public transit, bikeways, more local agriculture, unlimited migration, migration corridors, local grids, more wind, more solar, and stuff we haven't thought of because the oil companies have us bamboozled.
4388 2018-09-20 16:25:29 *Art show*

Artist: *proud beaming* .. So what do ya think? You look like you know and appreciate art.

Me: Well they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder but this, this.. is a real piece of shit buddy
4389 2018-09-20 16:25:23 Sir I have a question plz do answer. what will Pakistan gain from Oil city in Gwadar.
@Intl_Mediatior
4390 2018-09-20 16:25:20 Okay today's will be to clean and oil my boots
4391 2018-09-20 16:25:19 Took some $SAEX here at 7 off higher lows and oil is up in the area when $PED $GBR $YUMA $CEI went on those parablic runs and if $ALT decideds to take off for another run this shold follow low risk here 7 Avg last time oil was this high we had $PED $CEI $YUMA $GBR 200-1500% mover
4392 2018-09-20 16:25:18 It looks like it's bringing the flavor but I got to the coconut oil and thought "...but what if it's 78 degrees in my house?"
4393 2018-09-20 16:25:13 Then get us off of oil, idiot. All the bombers in the world aren’t any good if we can’t fuel them. Our economy and whole way of life depends on hostile foreign countries. America needs to develop new forms of energy to really be able to disengage with the Middle East.
4394 2018-09-20 16:25:11 First of all OPEC is not a " Monopoly" secondly you and GOP want to Institute a 25 cent increase per gallon so stop with the "I want 2 lower consumer prices "rap 
Also are you beating the war drums once again for oil?

4396 2018-09-20 16:24:54 We r now totally screwed and for sure saving anything will be a tall order.I guess even ERC will make sure the prices of oil reach the initially targeted 16% increase even if they say 8%.Hope counties don't buy into the housing scheme nonsense.
4397 2018-09-20 16:24:49 Not for no deep conditioner & hot oil treatment. I usually do it every time I wash my hair. But Nesha ain’t cut out for it today.

4400 2018-09-20 16:24:33 before I started using castor oil in middle school I would put like Vaseline on my eyebrows and eyelashes? Idk who tf told me to do that or if it’s even good for you but it worked for me
4401 2018-09-20 16:24:31 Feels damp all right,  looks to be a drop in temperature over the weekend,  have been using the oil to heat the cylinder over the summer so I know it's working when I decide to turn it on 
#winteriscoming
4402 2018-09-20 16:24:29 Poor oil Chas on @drivetime whilst he wants a 'modren' Garda force with 'modren' technology, he now rows back that it wouldn't be workable to stop the public using 'modren' technology to take photo of gardai. Leo says no, you're a puppet.
4403 2018-09-20 16:24:28 Good news Saudia is making oil city in Gawadar, great achievement by Pakistan Govt. within a Month 
4404 2018-09-20 16:24:26 You can go a lot longer than 3000 with oil these days lol i still try to do it at 3 tho cause i got over 200k on my truck
4405 2018-09-20 16:24:20 right but the vast majority of oil the US uses is domestic. Having a trade relationship with Canada where we ship you crude and you ship us refined products is good for everyone
4406 2018-09-20 16:24:19 really rough. recently there was a man who offered cannabis oil to people in need for medication and a petition was held around the country to reasses his punishment which is death penalty.
4407 2018-09-20 16:24:15 Yes that one works too but you have cash, get the jaimcan castor oil, it works best
4408 2018-09-20 16:24:15 Senator you are a fraud & socialist and so is Lisa. Why don't you both go on down to the socialist haven of Venezuela and fix their problems. True America don't need or want the snake oil you're selling!
4409 2018-09-20 16:24:14 this is a really good way to make the oil and soy sauce easier to spread around and get out of the plastic

4411 2018-09-20 16:24:11 @pepboysauto your apptt system sucks. Had 11 am apptt for oil change, car, still in the lot. Why give apptt when you can’t do the work on time. It is first come first serve even after having apptt.
4412 2018-09-20 16:24:10 Hi, I run a successful business called Golden Oil Stretch Marks massage therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you. When can I be at your service? Thank you
4413 2018-09-20 16:24:04 stuff like Horse testicles being animated shrinking in the winter. I know it won't effect the enjoyment of the game but what exactly is the point of that? There is also other more meaningful stuff too like having eat, clean and oil guns wear coats where its cold etc
4414 2018-09-20 16:24:03 If a proposed #US tariff of 25% on #autos from Canada actually happens, then memo to the US: Getting cheap #oil from Canada will soon get very expensive.
4415 2018-09-20 16:23:59 Pizza would be nice but I had to choose between that and Olive oil  edge control and face powder.

For once I didn't choose food.
4416 2018-09-20 16:23:56 CNBC pays him. Who pays CNBC? We don't know but would be surprised if big oil like Shell, BP, Mobil and Chevron don't advertise on the platform. Same with BMW, Daimler, VW, GM and Ford. 

Editors essentially select writers based on their publications. So bias is inherent.
4417 2018-09-20 16:23:55 I'm gonna start going to local shows with some oil and wrenches and change peoples oil bc god knows someone needs one

4419 2018-09-20 16:23:45 Wrong type of deal. I’m talking about deals to alter the terms of trade. Not deals to buy or sell arms or oil etc.
4420 2018-09-20 16:23:40 Thatcherism exploded the price of Oil
Thatcherism enabled the bonus-driven inflation of Coal prices.
Thatcherism has made houses either unaffordable or a life long debt.
Thatcherism has made train fares insanely high
Thatcherism has turned the UK into the Rich mans Jumble sale.
4421 2018-09-20 16:23:33 Nuclear winter. Coming ice age. Peak oil. Asbestos. CFCs. Population bomb. Inflation. Duck and cover. Aliens! Flood! Famine! Despair!

4424 2018-09-20 16:23:01 We started using Lavender oil (or other sleepy time oils) to help with sleep issues. Its been working great for us so far, about a month in. We mix it with a carrier oil and rub some on our temples.

4427 2018-09-20 16:22:53 funny that oil is only reason we do it nothing else cause they not loyal to us any except for isreal who has own agenda too. we gop to alternatives we be self sufficient but you rather cater to coal and old energy sources including the very oil in middle east cause money rules
4428 2018-09-20 16:22:53 You need to talk to your Saudi friends about oil costs .
4429 2018-09-20 16:22:53 !sigalert! three right lanes are blocked for cleanup of a crash & oil spill in #ElMonte on 605 SB before I-10, stopped traffic back to I-210

4434 2018-09-20 16:22:45 Tips  :
 
< every night before bed apply coconut oil to strengthen and grow 

<castor oil helps thicken and darken 

<before plucking apply ice and outline the shape your desire with a pencil

<trim your brows monthly 

<eyebrow gels are easier to apply and look more natural

4448 2018-09-20 16:21:42 OPEC is all about controlling the oil prices. That is why OPEC was created in the first place. Want to see oil prices drop? Support car manufacturers to produce more electric cars. Bring in solar and shut down oil generating stations. Reduce to demand for oil and the price drops

4451 2018-09-20 16:21:29 The New York Times is claiming that Canada is exporting more oil, than in the past.

4476 2018-09-20 16:18:30 Ma’am, essential oils are hella concentrated, you need to mix them with a carrier oil before you use them anywhere. I only put them in my shea body butter or if I mix up some oils with conditioner to act as a deep conditioner
4477 2018-09-20 16:18:30 We have record high oil and gas production.

You are not paying attention.
4478 2018-09-20 16:18:22 I actually have never seen a woman around my age get an oil change. Y’all do that?
4479 2018-09-20 16:18:19 Haha, or motor oil? I think they are looking into new packaging, but it’s still good for your brain! (Personally, I find this shape super easy to fit into the fridge door.)
4480 2018-09-20 16:18:11 New York Times: "President Trump Hit Iran With Oil Sanctions. So Far, They’re Working.

4486 2018-09-20 16:17:49 How many countries have nationalized oil industries?

That alone is no reason. And you know that. But, you must argue for the sake of it.
4487 2018-09-20 16:17:47 Obama was talking about jobs that are no longer necessary. Trump thinks coal and oil are the future.
4488 2018-09-20 16:17:43 How is that old fossil Orrin Hatch not oil yet?
4489 2018-09-20 16:17:43 Oh shut up Trump. Oil companies in the US, love high prices.
4490 2018-09-20 16:17:33 Andh bhakt khush hai aisi economy pe?
Jab oil/barrel is 70$ and Petrol price is Rs90 per litre and diesel Rs per litre. 
Per cylinder cost u now Rs900.
They are just earning money by imposing huge taxes on common man. This method is very good to increase economy for u ppl.

4494 2018-09-20 16:17:08 I co washed my hair with Garner whole blends conditioner, put Shea butter and olive oil and then twisted it !
4495 2018-09-20 16:16:56 Yeah, I deleted that tweet. I was trying to open a conversation. Not become the victim of an ad hominem pile-on. 

I know how oil works, tracking production was part of my job. 

Talk about the oil, not me.

4497 2018-09-20 16:16:55 Agreed. I think the push in the last century by big oil and car manufacturers for Seattle to let go of its mass transit system for a busier more congested road system is a travesty. At the very least Puget sound is rated the best masa transit for ferries.

4504 2018-09-20 16:16:12 "The Saudis received investments/military protection for cooperation on lucrative oil deals. The result is a shady alliance betw the world's most powerful dynasties. Never before has a US president been so closely tied to a foreign power supporting our country's mortal enemies."
4505 2018-09-20 16:16:10 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
4506 2018-09-20 16:16:09 If you want to win elections in 2019, then state s like Maharashtra have to drop taxes on Petroleum. Fiscally this is excellent, but common people have taken the brunt of oil price increase. Pls reduce the taxes on Petroleum else you will lose the state.

4539 2018-09-20 16:11:55 Am done with him they nationalised their oil industry can't keep up with the production then the oil prices went south from the highs of the crazy socialist idea.
4540 2018-09-20 16:11:43 The oil rich Gulf Countries were established by the West, England Established the Kingdom of Saudi and the US has military bases in that area, great place to the soldiers to find cheap women to fuck.

4541 2018-09-20 16:11:38 All over world every government is working on to replace fossil fuels drive system. At present  is the only option to save currency and stay away from oil politics. But battery is not the safe option.

4570 2018-09-20 16:09:43 Um, a monopoly is when a single entity controls the market.  Surprising you didn’t know that; after all you were in AC!  Doesn’t the US produce oil?
4571 2018-09-20 16:09:35 You know, Donnie, when we had the deal with Iran, Iran was pumping out huge amounts of cheap oil keeping the price down.  By walking away from the Iran deal, you've put OPEC back in charge.

4605 2018-09-20 16:07:05 Because it has so much less faaaaat!  Instead of oil, it's filled with cornstarch, which, according to someone who understands food chemistry very well, is a more bio-available carb than sugar.  Bad for diabetics & pre-diabetics.

We don't need OPEC....WE DONT NEED THE SAUDIES.
4636 2018-09-20 16:04:47 Yeah there’s more baby oil in your stretches init
4637 2018-09-20 16:04:46 My sweet little ford fuckus is about to have its 1st oil change tomorrow lol 
4638 2018-09-20 16:04:29 Oil goes high, government gets richer: Know about the method that makes fuel costlier. O.K. State owned Oil Cos. to be merged to one Unit to reduce cost of Production & 
Administrative. Regards.
4639 2018-09-20 16:04:22 Oil/energy so big/important, that to do as you so rightly suggest would not only threaten the biggest financial interests but also upend the current geopolitical-economic order. That's why I think Washington has thought of your suggestion, but it is too corrupt to act on it.
4640 2018-09-20 16:04:07 Or we could learn to rely on green sustainable energy sources and break our reliance on oil as our country was working towards with Obama before you came in and fucked everything up....

4642 2018-09-20 16:04:02 To your point, 82% of what we export is NOT oil. It is classified as “petroleum products “.

4655 2018-09-20 16:02:56 The other was impeached for cooking the books and should already be in jail. She was the one who bought the Pasadena oil refinery by 1 BILLION. The thing is a mount of rust. Just google about PETROBRAS CORRUPTION.
4656 2018-09-20 16:02:54 That’s awesome! These use cases are low hanging fruits in Oil & Gas vertical. 3D printing matched with these use cases is a killer combination, specially in under-water (mid-ocean) oil exploration scenarios.

4662 2018-09-20 16:02:19 My point is the same as yours- getting more oil out of US wells doesn't translate to lower prices in the US. My apologies for pedantry. It was not my intent.
4663 2018-09-20 16:02:16 They're not gonna volunteer to keep the oil in the ground.

4688 2018-09-20 16:00:05 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4689 2018-09-20 16:00:03 I hate having work done on my car bc they point out every little thing that’s wrong with it. “You need your oil changed” “Your ac isn’t working” “You need new tires” “There’s a dead bird on the front of your car” Like goddamm guys, chill...
4690 2018-09-20 16:00:00 The Romans used to clean themselves with olive oil since they did not have any soap. They would pour the oil on their bodies, and then use a strigil, which is type of blade, to scrape off any dirt along with the oil #fact

4693 2018-09-20 15:59:51 Nice, That was what I was thinking by your description. I was seriously looking for alternative countries for a second. I looked there because the real estate was reasonable for Canada. The hemp oil guy is there too. I used to be into that too.
4694 2018-09-20 15:59:43 i haven’t eaten in days because i spent my money on new oil colors
4695 2018-09-20 15:59:41 You should get your tires rotated every time you get an oil change..  or you’ll have to buy new tires much sooner. Coming from someone who has dated a mechanic for 3.5 years
4696 2018-09-20 15:59:30 I know facts hurt, U should find new job, and dont think political blooging going to make u much. Canada is in trouble, left wingers killing ur economy with bad policies, NAFTA being redone. The USA will be a oil exporter in 10 years, today natural gas. All this will kill Canada
4697 2018-09-20 15:59:28 It is clear to me that Trump through its tweets against OPEC instead of harming it’s recognizing and elevating the Organization to a stronger and better position in setting the path for the current and future oil market!
4698 2018-09-20 15:59:23 I changed my car’s oil filter the other day and I think I spent about 15 mins tightening the stupid filter instead of loosening it.  I feel like such an idiot.

4706 2018-09-20 15:58:49 That's because the U.S. threatened to cut them off from the American financial system if they continued to do business with Iran.
Zoom out: Per the IMF, close to 80% of Iran's tax revenue comes from oil.
4707 2018-09-20 15:58:41 Climate change is the Globalists propaganda to make America poor. We are the number one exporters of oil in the world.

4714 2018-09-20 15:58:04 We produce a great deal of light sweet crude (WTI-like). Which is what we make automotive fuels from. OPEC produces heavier sour crude, which requires more refining. But they produce a shitload of it, so they can dominate the market. The majority of our oil is ours or Canadian.

4728 2018-09-20 15:56:40 Need to "protect" oil helps justify the HUNDREDS of $billions spend on the military-industrial complex instead of things like universal healthcare.  Wall St. makes a killing recycling that many US dollars around the world...
4729 2018-09-20 15:56:38 Interesting round table sponsored by @Resource_Works yesterday, where @BlairKing_ca pointed out that, even when enviro-activists get the science wrong, they excel at PR, whereas the oil industry sucks at providing the information academics and journalists need. He's right.
4730 2018-09-20 15:56:33 Face washed and cleansed. Bio oil and fucidic acid applied. Eyes stinging. Mouth burning.
4731 2018-09-20 15:56:29 The whole mess in the Middle East is largely due to America and England interfering in the region cause of oil interests.
Wouldn’t expect you to know that though.
4732 2018-09-20 15:56:26 Uh...no. The taxpayers should not be subsidizing car manufacturers anymore than they should be subsidizing oil, gas or alternative energy.

4766 2018-09-20 15:54:25 You need more oil #Bot
4767 2018-09-20 15:54:25 Not great for China getting it food for a billion people (China cant grow their own food) from unreliable places like S. America. The fact is what makes USA very rich is we feed the world, now soon we will be exporting oil, oh what will Canada do?
4768 2018-09-20 15:54:20 An excellent reason to ditch oil and fully support, fund and continue development of alternative energy sources...I mean, beside trying to arrest climate change and preserve what’s left of our environment.
4769 2018-09-20 15:54:13 @gregandlucky guys....i do air conditioning and your car is not supposep to just lose its gas. No gas you have a leak. Ac must be used for at least 5min once a week so the seals get oil and doesn't perish. Or it is a manufacturer fault
4770 2018-09-20 15:54:12 I love changing people's oil just to show them how easy it is
4771 2018-09-20 15:54:08 And end all oil subsidies.
4772 2018-09-20 15:54:01 Okee okeee ... etapi kalo makan pasta, gapake soy oil itu gak enak .. untung bikin topingnya tadi pake minyak wijen.. jadi nyess gitu rasanya.. cuman ini sambel bangkoknya tetiba pedes bgt dahh..

4774 2018-09-20 15:53:51 Rafale Air craft scam is nothing but scam in armed forces in Water for Oil and Food in more Army Service Corps Military Engineering services contracts 100% corruption
4775 2018-09-20 15:53:48 @POTUS Mr President you want to do something that ensures you are, Are next 4 year President then put a Cap on Oil price in the USA  yesterday gas  was 2.59 a gallon today almost 3.00 dollars  a gallon the Oil Company is crushing the everyday consumer
4776 2018-09-20 15:53:43 I dunno, but if you wanna go that route, you lot might have to relinquish your claim to the toy company selling literal kilotons of non-recyclable oil products to be built into models of every Hollywood franchise imaginable, because that's American as fuck.
4777 2018-09-20 15:53:40 It is so obvious one must wonder why the brains trust in Washington hasn't come to the same conclusion? My opinion: it is because US power is maintained if it CONTROLS global access to energy via military "protection" of M.E. oil and US $ dominance in the ~$1T oil trade.
4778 2018-09-20 15:53:40 playing erykah and coconut oil started dripping outta my ears is this normal?
4779 2018-09-20 15:53:35 Strengths of the Eagle Ford include its low cycle times, high oil cuts and LLS pricing. “Returns from the Eagle Ford are fantastic,” says Abbott. #DUGEagleFord
4780 2018-09-20 15:53:35 Trump engages in stock fraud pretty much everyday. Telling OPEC to lower its oil price...STOCK FRAUD
4781 2018-09-20 15:53:34 USA is the largest producer of oil in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia.  Supply and demand drive the prices.  To lower the price either demand would have to decrease and/or production increase.  Read an economics book instead of watching Fox.

4794 2018-09-20 15:52:27 You export oil and gas and benefit from high prices. This is just another islanophobic dog whistle?
4795 2018-09-20 15:52:26 love to prop up murderous monarchies so they keep trading oil in USD
4796 2018-09-20 15:52:09 Trump wants to fight OPEC over oil prices. Why does America still give him such a hard time???? I will never understand. #maga

4799 2018-09-20 15:51:37 And I wonder how much this will cost us.... ?
Maybe we can go back to burning coal for energy. Maybe we can just use Alberta heavy oil as fuel, no need to refine it at all!

4800 2018-09-20 15:51:35 Yeah, that's the place I was thinking of. Didn't know they were more than olive oil (which is boldly advertised in the window IIRC).

4805 2018-09-20 15:51:04 Let me guess, Batman is disappointed in yet another oil leak on his HD?
4806 2018-09-20 15:51:02 I’m not a proponent of “cryptos”, of which I think the overwhelming majority are either snake oil/scams/scamforks/failed projects/testnets/delusions.
But Bitcoin stands apart from that rabble. And it is practically impossible for anyone to dilute the supply.

4811 2018-09-20 15:50:49 And they've convinced a whole swath of white flight America to vote for them because they've promised them overseer positions on their future slave plantations.

4818 2018-09-20 15:50:22 @kieran_will741 just a dwop of olive oil

4821 2018-09-20 15:50:12 As of 2012 we were only importing 10% of our oil from Nigeria. And of course comparing free Aid dollars $$ sent to Nigeria to the US PAYING for the oil is ludicrous. You know this

4829 2018-09-20 15:49:39 i shouldve let her car run out of oil... and yas i can!
4830 2018-09-20 15:49:34 Tried? I posted a pic, if you want me to try I’ll point out you goods haven’t “carried” anything other than the profits from our oil wealth for decades. Let’s see how you survive without an oil backed currency. Good luck gettin that debt refinanced 
4831 2018-09-20 15:49:27 We...make alot of oil.
4832 2018-09-20 15:49:25 We pull our military ... they pull their oil.  Who needs who more?

If Republicans truly want "energy independence," it's time to provide the same subsidies to the GROWING, JOB CREATING "green" energy industry as the fossil fuel industry (especially the dying coal industry).

4863 2018-09-20 15:46:19 Yes. But, the greedy oligarchs who run our economy don't care. Their money is in oil and defense contracts. Their money is in Chinese slave labor.
If China, OPEC, or Russia destroy our economy they won't care. They'll just take their money and yachts to Monte Carlo while we drown
4864 2018-09-20 15:46:17 OPEC oil shipments will dip by 180k b/d to 25.06m b/d in the 4 weeks to Oct. 6 vs. period to Sept. 8, according to data from tanker tracker Oil Movements.

When I moved to the Permian Basin Oilfield in Texas 5 years ago, I discovered that I had been lied to for decades. There is literally an ocean of oil here. And that is not mentioning the other plays or Alaska. The American People have been Played.
4866 2018-09-20 15:46:13 @OilSheppard David, you oil guys really must start reading about EVs - we are just about to create the UKs largest electric vehicle charging infra - across 1,000 initial sites and transitioning an initial 120,000 vehicles across two fleets.
4867 2018-09-20 15:46:12 Good keep anointing your head with oil @DemiladeR
4868 2018-09-20 15:46:10 I know how to? The bolt to release the oil is always on too tight for me to loosen though 
4869 2018-09-20 15:46:02 Funny how @campbellclaret is desperate for a 'People's Vote' on Brexit when he ignored a million people voting against his Iraq oil war, and when he did so much to close down voting inside Labour. He must be making as much £s out of the Remain campaign as he did his Iraq invasion
4870 2018-09-20 15:45:58 IF AMERICA KEPT OUR OIL WE WOULD BE OK ...BUT NO YOU HAD TO START EXPORTING IT TO EUROPE....BUT WE NEED IT HERE donald.  THAT IS WHAT IS RAISING PRICES FOR US.
4871 2018-09-20 15:45:47 Those of us who want lower oil prices and for OPEC to stop price gouging. But if you're okay with that, by all means, feel free to not include yourself.
4872 2018-09-20 15:45:46 And we'd have to nationalize the oil industry to keep all that oil here.

if he is, he should've known that its up 2 his Masters to reduce Oil prices,
I meant US $ UK Oil Companies, they're the one to tell you & to tell OPEC mercenaries what to do, if they wanted they would make the Oil $5/barrel in a day.
4876 2018-09-20 15:45:29 They are paying their fair share of Nato fees, CDB effects them too. Quit complaining, we are producing more oil then Opec is now, and it is being sold overseas, instead of here. So, give it a rest. How dumb do u think we are?  Problems is we are not that dumb/stupid as u are.

4878 2018-09-20 15:45:16 Yes, the India/Iran relationship is something I find interesting. Do you have a chart or data somewhere re: price shift upon Trump's announcement? Also, this is in the dim recesses of my mind, but I thought Iranian oil was not light/sweet/crude so there were issues with refining

4905 2018-09-20 15:43:50 And, just cuz you know shits and giggles, that lovely sweet shale oil? Yeah, too sweet. So the US goes long oil but still needs to import heavy, sour oil to get the right blend for the US refineries. Like, from Venezuela.

Which is quite funny.
4906 2018-09-20 15:43:46 Ask your domestic oil producers to reduce prices! Trump has been promoting the export of American crude, if he cared about prices he would demand those oil resources be used domestically. However we all know Trump doesn't care about American consumers, only what is init for Trump

4920 2018-09-20 15:42:44 This is interesting- on what do you base the assertion regarding natural oil seepage into the ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara?

Would statement be true if you included the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969?

Thank you for the article!
4921 2018-09-20 15:42:30 I’ve thought about shaving it off multiple times however my SO prefers me with it. I do keep it trimmed and use beard oil to keep it as soft as possible tho
4922 2018-09-20 15:42:29 Added to $SLCA under $20 today.  At $71 oil there will be huge demand for their sand like the $PXD deal, and last miles services.  Trading at a ridiculous 4x ebitda, buy here for a move to $25-$30.

4927 2018-09-20 15:42:03 We've been hearing about OPEC monopolies since the Oil embargo and oil shortages in 1973.  The US was supposed to stop being so dependent on foreign oil.  It's been 45 years. Seriously? 
Why is @realDonaldTrump suddenly waking up to the problem?  He's older than me.

Until I read it banned Alcohol related stocks.
And Nuclear power? Do people feel as strongly about that as oil and gas and guns?
This may turn out to be a dud.
4954 2018-09-20 15:40:36 Kidding after the President tweeted about Middle East and oil.
4955 2018-09-20 15:40:34 Nessa próxima semana (seg a qui) vai tá livre? 

não vou dar certeza nem nada, mas eu vou estar na oil & gas, as vezes eles precisam de gente de ultima hr pra trabalhar lá, vai que... ;)

4967 2018-09-20 15:40:11 The US is our only customer. We sell to them cheap. They refine and resell on the open market. The best way to control our oil (3rd largest proven reserves in the world btw) is to spread misinformation because, war with Canada would be unsupported by the global community.
4968 2018-09-20 15:40:10 Fracking ban was all Cuomo. He told this dolt to write the paper! What is surprising is that the oil and gas industry has not challenged this in court as we still don’t have any environmental issues in PA & Ohio

Oh how the turn tables

4973 2018-09-20 15:39:42 It does in part, but albeit years apart, coal /oil is also plant derived.
So plant more greenery for every gallon pulled out of the ground?
Even better, stop devastating worldwide forestry

4984 2018-09-20 15:38:34 But tea tree oil on the bites. It smells awful and tastes worse (my family didn't use soap to wash out my mouth when I got snippy) but it does miracles on bug bites

4986 2018-09-20 15:38:30 We assist the countries of the point in time eastward, they would not be preventative for really desire without us, and yet they keep to force for higher and higher oil ascertain! We design leave. The global organization market staleness get monetary value downwards now!

4991 2018-09-20 15:37:58 I love how men say they have a high pain tolerance  but are afraid of the oil from bacon popping, while women will say their pain tolerance is "ok " nd will walk around in pain ATLEAST once a month without complaining, and bounce right back from major pain like giving birth
4992 2018-09-20 15:37:38 because they are bought and paid for by oil men, tax cheats, wage thieves and polluters
4993 2018-09-20 15:37:24 Venezuela's oil dependency is not just an economic problem. It is also problem for the kind of relationship that exist between the state and the people, and therefore it is a problem for Venezuela's democracy itself.
4994 2018-09-20 15:37:21 I would rather boil my bollocks in oil than watch that fuckin rubbish

4997 2018-09-20 15:37:09 The US ruined the Middle East. They were doing just fine without us. Look at how drastically it has changed since the U S decided to meddle. Mr. President the US has enough oil if we were just aloud to use it.
4998 2018-09-20 15:37:06 @potus Ever hear of Supply & Demand? Reduce our Demand, they have too much Supply & $ drops. Do that w good ol American ingenuity: new energy means, less oil based plastic, more fuel efficient cars. How presidential that guidance could be. #ThinkSmart

5042 2018-09-20 15:33:32 If prices go down, Fracking will not be cost effective any more and US oil companies will go out of business. Be careful what you wish for...

5044 2018-09-20 15:33:18 I think pretty much if you eat at a chain there’s going to be some animal in it unless you get the chicken sandwich. Best veggie sandwich I’ve been able to come up with so far. 
Spring mix, avocado, jalapeños, olive oil, salt and pepper, feta cheese, all in a spinach wrap.

5047 2018-09-20 15:33:07 The alternative is Repsol Sinopec for the same reasons, but they were recently downsizing in the UK. Resurgence in oil price might have changed things.

5051 2018-09-20 15:32:37 Let’s see you survive with no armed forces, no English wealth, you have dwindling oil and tourism. Your a joke - England will survive after Brexit, so will NI and Wales you’ve shown why you lost your independence as your a cowardly bunch

5063 2018-09-20 15:31:58 So only thing the so called most powerful man in the world can do about high gas prices is an angry tweet?, Maybe if you kept fuel efficient cars and invested in solar and wind power oil prices would go down because of weak demand? Just a thought 
5064 2018-09-20 15:31:52 Its the U.S. and Russia that drive oil prices . We are the top producers. If you had not dropped out of the Iranian nuclear weapons pact prices would not have shot up. You clearly dont understand the repercussions of your actions.
5065 2018-09-20 15:31:46 Govt is sitting on huge surplus grains, pulses, sugar and milk powder. These are in high demand in Venezuela. Govt can barter these with cheap oil at $40/ barrel and ask them to ship in their own vessels. But Govt is choosing to waste everything.

5072 2018-09-20 15:31:02 No problem, just buy our oil from other countries until they lower their prices. After all, there are plenty of other countries with oil just flowing out of the ground!
When you act like an ass to them they will actually lower their prices just to make you happy!

Go away......

5115 2018-09-20 15:28:06 How about you do us all a favor and sign an executive order capping the price of gasoline as diesel to 2$ a gallon !!??

5116 2018-09-20 15:28:01 He seemed very focused on exporting human resources in the form of experts.

But how many experts would an Indian oil company need from AB to supervise/lead/whatever their own projects. 

Legit question, as Kenney presents that we could be getting thousands of AB employed there.
5117 2018-09-20 15:27:57 How I wish you were taken seriously by the cartel and really do something about rising oil prices instead of fooling around with the world.

5128 2018-09-20 15:27:19 Not to me! He's a fkface, slick snakeoil salesman just like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Turned his back on indigenous Canadians & fkd them over for oil money after promising to protect them... just like BO did w/DAPL.
5129 2018-09-20 15:27:19 Odd question, but if you smoke weed is it grown with Neem Oil? It's an organic fungicide that many many grows use, especially on a larger scale like at a dispensary. But the problem is, organic or not, it's not meant to be smoked. Lots of people are wrongly told it's hyperemesis.

5133 2018-09-20 15:27:11 Instead, one of Trump’s first tariffs was a 30% hike on solar panels.
Trump is beholden to oil oligarchs - Russia & here - who are trying to get every buck out of their oil before it runs out.

5166 2018-09-20 15:24:28 We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
5167 2018-09-20 15:24:27 I hate subsidies. But you have still failed to point out which oil producing states, or even Venezuela’s neighboring states, that contain populations that are starving to death.

Ideally, I'd keep him inside, but Luke is an idiot. If a door opens, he must go through it. No exceptions.
5172 2018-09-20 15:24:03 The most logical answer would be that one has oil in it , I guess

Is Rahm "blind" or also receiving hidden Bribes? That's Chavismo's regime specialty, on the use of oil money.
5177 2018-09-20 15:23:36 8 a.m. oil changes suck. “ I’m sure we will be done within 2 hours “ well I would hope so.

5180 2018-09-20 15:23:27 You talking about Isreal? Good luck getting the Saudi’s to lower oil prices. Maybe you could put a tariff on oil from Middle East to protect American oil companies. Tariffs seem to be your favorite tool!
5181 2018-09-20 15:23:21 he looks a bit forlorn, we need to see his bullish side
5182 2018-09-20 15:23:17 You do realize that we are among the worlds leaders in oil production now right?  Oh yeah your tariffs are donkey punching us and our ability to export.  Plus you know the whole Iran sanctions thing.  You created this
5183 2018-09-20 15:23:15 "Iran may choose to focus its efforts away from the oil sector and begin diversifying or upping investment in other commodities. Natural gas faces many of the same crossover issues related to oil... But the petrochemicals industry could be an attractive prospect"
5184 2018-09-20 15:23:13 Interesting information, but not relevant.  Need to know occupancy for it to matter.  IMO, we are likely looking at the oil equivalent of “ghost cities” — part of the infrastructure build project and nothing more.
5185 2018-09-20 15:23:13 Shey if we are even moving backwards, we would gradually move to 1970 and enjoy another oil boom...but right now, the country is as redundant as her generals. You said it all in that tweet about leaving this country if one can. There's nothing here.
5186 2018-09-20 15:23:13 I’ve always called it going in for a lube, oil and filter.

5188 2018-09-20 15:23:07 Time is money and time is valuable but $90 for an oil change at @Valvoline is absolutely not worth any time for no wait. Holy smokes that hit me hard. #LessonLearned
5189 2018-09-20 15:22:58 I love oil and gas. Oil and gas is a great fuel for running cars. Heating homes. Cooking. Flying to far off destinations.
5190 2018-09-20 15:22:52 Since 1918 the U.S and Europe have plotted, split and destabilized the Middle East. Your recent decision to stop all aid to Palestine will destabilize it more. BTW, rather than browbeating them into a short term fix, why don't we get off oil, and be energy independent?

5195 2018-09-20 15:22:44 Why do synthetic oil changes cost so much money 
5196 2018-09-20 15:22:39 Today's breaking news is that crude oil importers from Iran would be paid in terms of rupee. Good way to reduce dollar price vs rupee. How do you think if Reliance Oil too accepts rupees in lieu of dollar- if further reduction to genuinely happen?

5198 2018-09-20 15:22:27 one of my high school friends did this. i asked if she ever got her oil changed and she real life didnt know what it was lmao

5205 2018-09-20 15:21:56 Are the going to stop drilling for oil and gas and transition to renewables? Because that’s the action we need from them. Otherwise, this is disingenuous greenwash.
5206 2018-09-20 15:21:53 They called your bluff now you gotta get your oil changed and go to the family gathering.
5207 2018-09-20 15:21:48 Only gripe I have with this one (and probably all electric models) is how long it takes to heat up the oil and to re-heat the oil if you've got a double-bird group.

5216 2018-09-20 15:20:31 Also, oil often contains some aromatic compounds, e.g. benzene, toluene, so name because of their sweet smell. But high sulfur content will overwhelm those odors, thus the "sour" designation

5319 2018-09-20 15:13:23 YL Raven on your nape, chest with carrier oil. Inhale what’s left. Diffuse thieves and lavender. Sweet sleep. 
5320 2018-09-20 15:13:20 @DemSocialists You people are sick and twisted. Its obvious u don't have a fucking clue to how socialism has killed 100 million people over the last 100 years. Look no further then Venezuela u stupid morons. People are starving to death and they are a oil rich country.

5322 2018-09-20 15:13:14 Wait... why are you giving up The Ordinary/Deciem? I’ve just started using their primer and rosehip oil, are they suddenly a problematic brand? 
5323 2018-09-20 15:13:08 Mr. President if oil prices down how we can pay you cash then ??
5324 2018-09-20 15:13:03 หงุดหงิดวุ้ยยยย 
5325 2018-09-20 15:12:58 @MarkSimoneNY vape is a liquid. You can get Cannibis oil for vaping. There is no smell that lingers.
5326 2018-09-20 15:12:57 If anyone is educated on cbd oil for pets I'd greatly appreciate it if you could enlighten me, my dog has been having seizures lately and I've heard cbd has incredible effects on limiting them!
5327 2018-09-20 15:12:39 政治の話が苦手な方は荒ぶっててすみません
5328 2018-09-20 15:12:35 Change your own damn oil
5329 2018-09-20 15:12:33 Tax cuts. Economy, healthcare, oil production, criminal investigations, border security, better immigration laws. More drug and human trafficking arrests, stronger military. This is a few things and the Democrats will eliminate these changes with there policies.
5330 2018-09-20 15:12:25 Actually, looks just like my cousin Byron down in Louisiana. Lil Barns we call him.  He's always talking about making killing alligators and making gator gumbo in an oil drum, stirring with a hockey stick. Yup. That's Lil Barns
5331 2018-09-20 15:12:24 Oh the irony.... its rich. Like Saudi oil tycoon rich lol lol
5332 2018-09-20 15:12:22 Papano sosyal ang ginamit organic oil hahaha

5333 2018-09-20 15:12:19 Raise up their defense costs they raise the oil it cost us money
5334 2018-09-20 15:12:16 Brain-dead moron. US is nearly self-sufficient in oil production, surpassing Russia and Saudi as top producer. Why? Production price vs selling price. Cyclical supply and demand. Econ 101. Has nothing to do with Saudi pushing prices higher. WE are bigger than Saudi.
5335 2018-09-20 15:12:14 U bugging for conventional oil every 3 to 5k miles but synthetic blend or full synthetic you could easily go from 5 to 7500 miles no problem
5336 2018-09-20 15:12:13 Might be unpopular, but here it goes. As long as zoos are non-profit and humane, they do a good job of showing animals to kids and people who can't afford to travel. They too have a right to see the wonders of the world and can be made aware of what's at stake.
5337 2018-09-20 15:12:04 TRY to think this through. USA withdraws military protection for sea lanes. Oil tankers stop bringing crude to the USA. Whose economy is going to suffer sooner and worst when oil shipments stop and gas prices skyrocket: USA or Saudi Arabia? DUH!
5338 2018-09-20 15:12:04 idk who son need to hear this but get your girlfriend’s oil changed
5339 2018-09-20 15:11:57 Clothes are washed,car oil changed, tires rotated, washed, & filled up. Just need to go pack then I’m on the road for the weekend.

5347 2018-09-20 15:11:19 OR.  We could reduce our need for oil and go for greener alternatives.  Time to come into the 21st century!!
5348 2018-09-20 15:11:19 I got coconut oil in my eye, it doesn’t hurt or anything but I’m dumb blind in my left eye now

5353 2018-09-20 15:10:45 In August you reversed the the car makers more stringent mile per gallon requirements.  Insuring your Saudi buddies, we will be using even more of their oil. Now you try to divert our attention from all your other problems, with another problem you caused.
5354 2018-09-20 15:10:44 Always always me. That or i get new cloths and decide to change my oil
5355 2018-09-20 15:10:28 Have you tried CBD oil to help with withdrawal?

5357 2018-09-20 15:10:21 to be fair, it's not a lifetime appointment... SCOTUS jurists can be impeached, which lends more credibility to confirming Kavanaugh ASAP.
5358 2018-09-20 15:10:14 I understand. Most people are spiritual but don't believe in organized religion. Unfortunately I know too much about different religions. It's the equivalent of snake oil salesmen. It may temporarily make you feel better but won't cure you. 50% don't believe.
5359 2018-09-20 15:10:13 Oil. Maybe a clear sealant. No paint.

5363 2018-09-20 15:10:00 Venezuela is in its situation because of never diversifying its economy away from oil. Yes its current government is corrupt and a failure. None of this has to do with lifting up all Canadians and not just the few.
5364 2018-09-20 15:10:00 Keep insulting OPEC. See what happens with the oil prices then.
5365 2018-09-20 15:09:57 ปัญหาเยอะนักคราวหลังก็ทำกันเองนะ ไม่ต้องมาฝากให้เราทำอีก เบื่อออออ 
5366 2018-09-20 15:09:53 Saudi should lower their oil prices to compete with Iran. If they can lower them so far, it will force Iran to lower theirs to remain competitive. Shutting off funding to terrorist organizations. Win win situation
5367 2018-09-20 15:09:38 @HamidMirPAK Ik bend his first knees infront of usa by allowing saudia and removing china from planting oil refinering in gawadar
5368 2018-09-20 15:09:24 i’ve taken kids to school, gone to ththe gym, cleaned my car out, got an oil change, opened a savings account and another checking account, all before 10 am, i’m tired
5369 2018-09-20 15:09:21 Looks like an oil painting!
5370 2018-09-20 15:09:21 Or we could move away from oil and go with clean renewable energy.  Derp.

5372 2018-09-20 15:09:13 Do you have a ton of oil under your sink? And a few hundred thousand 'collateral' men, women and children you are prepared to butcher to get it?
5373 2018-09-20 15:09:09 I’m getting my oil changed and this man stuttering hard asf 
5374 2018-09-20 15:08:47 Pakistan has invited Saudi Arabia to join CPEC as the 3rd strategic partner. Saudi Arabia to invest 10 billion dollars and build oil city in Gawadar Pakistan
5375 2018-09-20 15:08:43 Read the book. The Allen Carr one. Also pick up the tea tree oil toothpicks for the mouth habit part. Toothpicks literally got me through the cravings. I dont recommend nicotine supplements cause they keep you addicted.
5376 2018-09-20 15:08:40 A drug-running south Florida 1960s vintage twin of unknown provenance. What could POSSIBLY go wrong?

That big high wing, you climbed up on top to check the oil. It felt like a B-25 in the pilot’s seat! It had OVERHEAD SWITCHES to start the engines!

5378 2018-09-20 15:08:28 Agree. But some concessions are clear. If read into conjunction Perry's declar after his meeting with Novak, one of Trump's tweets from today, it results that cooperation with RU to lower oil prices (if that would be achieved- diff matter) is imp issue for current administration
5379 2018-09-20 15:08:28 ini kaya baby oil gt ga tekstur nyaa apa gmn?
5380 2018-09-20 15:08:27 Naja, "crude oil" ist jetzt nix neues in nem Diesel 
Wenn du dir anschaust was bei alten Diesel Autos passiert ist wenn sie nach nem Unfall auf der Seite lagen, da haben sie dann das Öil einfach genommen und man könnte sie nicht mehr abschalten
5381 2018-09-20 15:08:14 I’m not big on climate change but if these companies were serious about this, we wouldn’t be paying for gas, everything would be ran off electricity, solar or nuclear power. But, dems don’t want this either! They have oil investments! Lol
5382 2018-09-20 15:08:12 Stop exporting our oil reserves, prices are high because of that!
5383 2018-09-20 15:08:11 This would mean a port in SA will give oil ship priority to CPEC?
5384 2018-09-20 15:08:11 We could develop green technology and get off oil, then they would not be able to have that leverage over us.
5385 2018-09-20 15:08:10 Americans also haven’t a clue the huge number of everyday products that come from oil or are manufactured via oil products.  plastics, synthetic fabrics, cosmetics ingredients, basic solvents, etc etc.
5386 2018-09-20 15:08:03 I like the oil, just a few drops on my tongue is great. My friends have vaped it with good results.
5387 2018-09-20 15:07:58 For the simple reason that oil from the Niger Delta has sustained Nigeria for more than 75% of its independent existence.
5388 2018-09-20 15:07:56 Yeah sure they are the only country big oil complies with is the US all other countries just allow them to pollute all the land, air, water cause oil companies could careless cause there is no money in it. And Trump has stated to his buddies they can pollute with no worries now.
5389 2018-09-20 15:07:53 How will you manage Alberta's finances to reduce dependcy on the uncertain revenue stream associated with the extraction and sale of oil sands products?

5392 2018-09-20 15:07:38 We remain convinced that oil prices will trend lower over the coming months and that WTI will fall below US$60/b. For natural gas we remain bulls and recommend investors add to positions during energy stock market weakness.
5393 2018-09-20 15:07:38 You tell 'em Donald! I mean, all that oil that the US exports has no business coming to the US consumer to bring our prices down. It's much easier to force OPEC into higher prices. That means oil company profits go up AND we can blame someone else when it was you all along! Yay!

5395 2018-09-20 15:07:36 I don't care about Opec. We have plenty of oil. He can drown the market and force them to lower prices. He doesn't because his buddies in TX are racking the money.....think truth...once plz

5397 2018-09-20 15:07:30 Excellent move #PMOIndia to pay for Iranian crude oil with rupees later this year; it should reduce rupee's unwarranted weakening if any, and stem possible short-term over-shooting vis-a-vis US dollar. But bid to restrict gold imports with higher duties can well boost smuggling

5405 2018-09-20 15:06:58 I've had it, but mostly in Korean BBQ, where it's been marinated. I did have it raw once with salt and sesame oil, though. Both times I've found it delicious. 

I *will* say, in fairness, that when I had liver and onions, though, the liver was bland and leathery tough.

5424 2018-09-20 15:05:45 The US is producing more than ever, but continues to export vast quantities. I thought our goal 20 yrs ago was to be less reliant on foreign oil. WTF?
5425 2018-09-20 15:05:33 Yes I know . But you need to remember the sacrifices made by our parents. My father was a captain on a oil tanker , not the safest place during the war. 
My advice would be , you look after your country and we’ll look after ours.

5428 2018-09-20 15:05:20 No...we had oil and gas, coal too...always welcomed, really? That’s why they’re leaving in droves, including our own nationals are getting out of NHS, teaching, services

5432 2018-09-20 15:04:59 Venezuela, also not socialist, were using oil profits to bolster their safety nets. They suffered heavy economic sanctions and political sabotage at the hands of the wealthy backed by the U.S., you can bring up Venezuela but it proves nothing.
5433 2018-09-20 15:04:59 Bitch then she just tried to charge me 69$ for high quality oil. No thanks, I’ll take the cheap shit

5438 2018-09-20 15:04:32 Oil prices responded positively to the headline commercial crude stocks decline of 2.1Mb on Wednesday. Overall stocks of petroleum and products fell by 0.4Mb with gasoline inventories down by 1.7Mb and distillate fuels rose by 0.8Mb.
5439 2018-09-20 15:04:19 Nah...the military industrial machine will gobble whatever is most conveniently in it’s path. There would be blow back for going to war with France - but it would be from the $$$ people- because fancy food isn’t as profitable as oil.
5440 2018-09-20 15:04:17 Iran would send us more oil at lower prices but you hate them and screwed up our nuke agreement. Start another war Republicans are good at that. Your guy Bolton wants another one so we can get more oil!

5442 2018-09-20 15:04:08 Israel has oil??
5443 2018-09-20 15:03:59 I’ve been saying this for years. Decades. Every time we go fight another war for oil. I hope more people listen when you say it.
5444 2018-09-20 15:03:46 No, not that i noticed atleast, I didn’t have any problems with them. Once they started to look spotty I just used coconut oil and took them off and my eyes look the same as before I got them

5453 2018-09-20 15:03:16 oil prices have long been around $ 100 and that did not affect the growth of the countries. Mr. Trump forgets that natural resources are very important to the country that exploits them

5514 2018-09-20 14:59:30 Here is an easier time line for you to follow.

5538 2018-09-20 14:57:38 I’m confused, we produce most the oil, we protect an area of the world we don’t own? But then try to tell them what to price their assets. Doesn’t sound like we are the pushers of capitalism and democracy. Sounds like we are just a big tyrant flexing all over the globe

5550 2018-09-20 14:56:41 How about the oil that is produced in the U.S. by U.S. companies?  Begin with that.  American oil companies are gouging us.  But then again, they do contribute large sums of money to the Republicans.

5560 2018-09-20 14:56:07 It could be the case, but Venezuela’s oil practically belonged to the U.S. since the days of Venezuela’s first and second “oil booms” back in the late 1930’s. 

But then, why leave it to the Russians, Chinese and Iranians?? (aka U.S. enemies)
5561 2018-09-20 14:56:07 It's more than oil though, - fishing grounds, crown estate, etc are involved.  They are Scottish waters so they will become ours on independence
5562 2018-09-20 14:56:02 While I agree that the prices must go down, I’m a little confused as to why we aren’t using our own oil? Considering we produce the most crude in the world.
Also, did you just put into words that oil prices were more important than the  human lives we “protect?”
5563 2018-09-20 14:56:00 Remember: the Harper government tried for years and failed to get the deal they wanted. Kenney was in cabinet.

"Dems": "how quickly do you want it?" [later on phone: "Hey order that Rolls & go buy that mansion, we got a big dividend coming!"]

They’re the most cost effective oil producers on the planet btw.

5600 2018-09-20 14:53:11 You are right...we saved our oil because without oil we won't be able to win the next world war. Very smart on our behalf. Thankfully we used everyone else's oil first.

5622 2018-09-20 14:51:48 VZ, once the "richest country in S America" w/ the largest proven reserves of oil in the world.
It's the coercion-based system - more coercive thn other Govs/States. GovEnforcers keep it afloat, most likely bc they get food ahead of common folk. Shun Enforcers & their supporters!
5623 2018-09-20 14:51:36 i have to go take my car for an oil change :/ blep
5624 2018-09-20 14:51:22 Yeah, agree they don't want to rap into sovereign fund, but they have big investments to diversify economy. Oil price will decline over time.

5627 2018-09-20 14:51:03 Since you can't use the internet, I'll help you. Ted was born in Calgary because his dad had to move their family from HOUSTON for his oil job. Ted grew up in HOUSTON and went to UT. Smh. It sucks that so many people are as ignorant as you.
5628 2018-09-20 14:51:00 Why not get off fossil fuels with renewables. Innovation and development can wean us off oil.  Leave the Middle East to themselves. They cant eat their oil.

5633 2018-09-20 14:50:51 So sorry. Have you explored any alternative options ? Conventional methods don’t work sometimes. There are so many herbs that can stop cancer . Cbd oil .
5634 2018-09-20 14:50:49 I’ve been suffering from stress induced headaches lately (also lack of sleep) and I’ve found that rubbing peppermint oil on my temples has really helped.
5635 2018-09-20 14:50:36 Would the price be even lower if eastern Canada stopped importing oil from Nigeria et al & started using western Canadian oil?

5637 2018-09-20 14:50:20 If you never changed your oil or tires in your car, and eventually your engine seizes and you crash into something, I don't believe insurance should pay for that either. We need to at least do bare minimum maintenance on our bodies, too.
5638 2018-09-20 14:50:18 Like I expected a different outcome. By the way Kenyans, how does it feel now knowing that we actually produce oil? #FinanceBill2018
5639 2018-09-20 14:50:10 I need an oil change so bad but I work 4am to 6pm 6 days a week and literally don’t know wtf I’m gonna do 
5640 2018-09-20 14:50:02 No my friend. You were sold a pup, a bottle of snake oil by a band of charlatans. Their way lies catastrophe
5641 2018-09-20 14:49:57 We don't see any sign of development. On the other hand we see that we are being cheated by various govt. depts. I have not received refund of cancelled ticket's proceeds. Previously this did not happened. Fuel price is all time high while crude oil price is low.
5642 2018-09-20 14:49:47 Thats rediculous! OPEC will release more then. The world doesnt need Iranian oil
5643 2018-09-20 14:49:43 Rasanya ingin menempelkan clean n clear oil control ke muka si mamah.
5644 2018-09-20 14:49:32 @OnPointRadio Just tuned in, tried to call... Have you talked about the human endocannabinoid system? I never hear it mentioned in discussions regarding CBD oil. It would help people understand how it works in the human body
5645 2018-09-20 14:49:29 Mr. @realDonaldTrump because you do not force US companies that extract oil to lower OIL prices and export it at those "low prices" to compete with the "high prices" of #OPEC?
5646 2018-09-20 14:49:28 Obviously we're hearing this from a genuine victim expert with degrees in Victimology from a great online university! We should accept his deeply biased and mysogenistic opinions like water accepts oil
5647 2018-09-20 14:49:28 Seriously, how much snake oil profits will be poured into mindfulness..you can medidate for free..takes about 15 minutes or less to learn how to do it...dupes of hazard falling sucker once again to blindly trusting bad algos..
5648 2018-09-20 14:49:25 Got a small Sourin “vape” and some cbd oil additive and slept so so well last night. My joints and back hurt so much less today than usual.  I cannot believe I made fun of vapes so long when they are the only thing that has helped me.
5649 2018-09-20 14:49:24 Oil companies know this, but dont care
5650 2018-09-20 14:49:23 AMERICA HAS OIL!!!
5651 2018-09-20 14:49:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5652 2018-09-20 14:49:10 it is likely that i don't know all the facts in this regard.  i do recall reading that usa is now the worlds largest oil producer.  so, what are you trying to prise out of these opec hooligans?
5653 2018-09-20 14:49:08 when you’re stuck at your oil change for an hour and a half, you bring your headphones to watch tv on your phone.. BUT FORGET YOU DONT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK ANYMORE
5654 2018-09-20 14:49:04 Difficult to see these people speaking out against once of the biggest driver's of our economy. Oil sands on the decline, yes.  US oil prod on the rise,yes. Easy when they have all of the investment with out ridiculous tax laws. What's the point of carbtax is nothing to tax
5655 2018-09-20 14:49:00 Stealing the oil is Trump policy no1
5656 2018-09-20 14:48:57 You say that as if people care about USA. You even said immigrants are sucking off USA ... and our oil? We sell it. NEXT.
5657 2018-09-20 14:48:56 Pake hadalabo tuh enak sih, tp menurutku dia ga begitu ngangkat kotoran dan oil sisa first cleanser. Jadinya malah jerawatan :)) kusarankan phisohex nder
5658 2018-09-20 14:48:54 The United States is the largest oil producer in the World, why do we need to react to OPEC? The US consumption of oil per day is around 19.5 million barrels.

5663 2018-09-20 14:48:20 Your statements don’t become accurate if you repeat false things, they are still false. Talk to your pastor, he will happily confirm the roots of the “blessed oil”. All the best ;-)
5664 2018-09-20 14:48:15 What I don’t share are opinion pieces on Global Warming by skeptics that don’t allow comments beneath the article. They do this to prevent real scientific  research from opposing their views. It is also what an oil loving gov generates through mass media for its readers.
5665 2018-09-20 14:48:13 Btw. I’m sure it will taste horrid. I take CBD oil tincture. It’s not pleasant. 
5666 2018-09-20 14:48:10 They were Parmesan garlic oil rubbed wings, salt and peppered for flavor, baked! We like our wings naked for the crissssp! Yummy, I like to dip mine in buffalo sauce and have a beer with it. Big treat for me! Baked potato sadly had to play second fiddle to the awesome wings. 
5667 2018-09-20 14:48:05 Oil should NOT be traded on the Mercantile!
5668 2018-09-20 14:48:04 I don't understand, what is our vital interest?  I know a quaint concept, but maybe worth considering.  If they're thinking capture that oil, they're in for a big surprise.  Probably not worth the money.  Plus, they're OG OPEC.
5669 2018-09-20 14:47:44 And extra oil in your mixy hair? Lol
5670 2018-09-20 14:47:42 Ridiculous! When have we limited weapon sales to Saudi Arabia? In this case Yemmnies are backed by Iran, with the sole purpose of destabilizing Saudi Arabia! Having the worlds largest oil producer under siege is not good geopolitics! Pompao understands that!

5678 2018-09-20 14:46:58 Tell OPEC to piss off and stop exporting US oil. They will be begging us to buy oil from them again in 6 months. Then make them sign a contract on 50 dollars a barrel for the next 10 yrs
5679 2018-09-20 14:46:58 Norway has already diversified their economy. And thanks to government ownership of oil, they have a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.
5680 2018-09-20 14:46:55 We take someone's oil? Canada's probably.

5682 2018-09-20 14:46:52 We can do that in 24 hours. Just request the lovely islami brather countries to stop supplying them oil. Within 24 hours all problems will be resolved without a single bullet being fired.
5683 2018-09-20 14:46:45 Remember, OPEC  has been reporting the same exact oil reserves for over 20 years...Big Lie! Oil reserves are far less then reported, many middle east countries will soon be decimated by reduced oil or no oil in reserve. This is nothing but big trouble on the horizon. IRAQ has oil

5685 2018-09-20 14:46:25 Cannabidiol, known to most of us as CBD is a natural chemical compound found in hemp plants. CBD helps alleviate pain & provides medicinal & therapeutic benefits but CBD does not produce the “high” often associated with marijuana. CBD oil can be applied directly to the skin.

5690 2018-09-20 14:45:48 Cycling & using public transport system not only good for individual health & economy also by reducing oil consumption improves the economy of the country.
5691 2018-09-20 14:45:44 Why don’t we just work harder to use less oil?  The US getting off fossil fuels would screw them pretty good.
5692 2018-09-20 14:45:44 We protect the Middle Eastern countries that we buy oil from and aren’t currently bombing. All that is beside the point, which is that you haven’t got a first grader’s understanding of geopolitics or economics. You do know how run businesses into the ground and go broke, though
5693 2018-09-20 14:45:43 Ma'am, you can justify your position the best way possible but I maintain that your report and scripting is inaccurate, baseless and vexatious. @WinnersChapelNL does not sell anointing oil to its members. You are free to fact-check that claim anytime (that is, if you want to).

5704 2018-09-20 14:44:50 Oh thank you! I don’t do much, basically I make sure to use a LOT of conditioner, like I use regular conditioner along with the color adding stuff. I also only wash it every other day and don’t use heat (air dry only). I use a bit of hair oil as well for shine/taming frizz

5707 2018-09-20 14:44:43 I have already left darkness (Islam) & accepted The Light (Jesus). Jesus said He is An-Noor (The Light): “I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.” (John 8:12).
5708 2018-09-20 14:44:42 Where do you buy the oil at?
5709 2018-09-20 14:44:41 Mine does but most don’t. Every 3-5,000 miles depending on the oil change you get.
5710 2018-09-20 14:44:36 He was just like the snake oil salesmen of the old western movies; all talk and no delivery!  It saddens me to think that he would have NEVER been elected in the first place if voters just vetted him on their own and not rely on the main stream media for their information.

5724 2018-09-20 14:42:51 We should all pay more for oil products and use less.  This is very simple, Mr. Trump.  If you weren't in the pocket of the massive and wealthy oil industry, you would admit this were true.

5728 2018-09-20 14:42:19 Cooking pierogies in oil is a death wish
5729 2018-09-20 14:42:11 Bah c'est pas tant ça le soucis, vaut mieux même avoir une petite team, sinon ton oil va fondre .... Je runnais avec une équipe qui coûtait 35 oil par combat, ça fait déjà 10 + (35x4) = 150 oil par run et mine de rien ça va très vite déjà u_u

5733 2018-09-20 14:42:01 Just now, sitting in the waiting area of the Mercedes dealership when my phone rings:

Me: Hello?
Woman: Hi, this is Holly from Ford, your 2005 Five Hundred is due for an oil change.
Me: Oh, I've got bad news for you...
5734 2018-09-20 14:41:54 As plastic is an oil product does the agreement include non-expansion of fossil fuel industries?
5735 2018-09-20 14:41:44 Good grief! The self-appointed "Sustainable Business Consultant" has re-emerged and is trying to convince people that Malaysian palm oil is sustainable and that palm oil is a sustainable feedstock for biofuels!

5736 2018-09-20 14:41:43 Honestly I’d love to do the oil slick hair but I’m genuinely afraid of upkeep like how do u take care of that dhsjsksk do u just like never wash it and cry when u do??
5737 2018-09-20 14:41:39 I suspect the motor car was not invented to cart us around at all, but was invented purely to use the produc the oil companies had to sell. Electric cars were excellent in 1900, and steam were pretty good by 1920, but the internal combustion motor won out,
5738 2018-09-20 14:41:31 Ah, quills from oil soaked birds (the un-feathered variety ).
5739 2018-09-20 14:41:23 -Jobless claims at 49-year low. 

-VA exceeds goals for delivering appeals decisions. 

-America now world's leading oil producer. 

All great turnaround stories. #BetterOffNow
5740 2018-09-20 14:41:20 I already sold some puts strike 69 for next Friday..Any dip in oil and this is a buy...
5741 2018-09-20 14:41:08 Popcorn! I like the olive oil  one from Trader Joe’s which is better than potato chips ( which is my favorite thing ever) it also has fiber!
5742 2018-09-20 14:40:59 The US Energy Information Agency (EIA) reports imports of foreign oil were 19% in 2017, the lowest since 1967. EIA predicts further decline. If we reduce use of oil, we will eliminate dependence, save money, and open up the alternative energy job sector here at home.
5743 2018-09-20 14:40:47 okay listen lol Get a Aloe Vera Leaf (from a farmers market) cut it into pieces and in half’s. Get a dispenser bottle (hair store) mix a tablespoon of Extra Virgin olive oil and Coconut Milk together. Rub the gel from the leaf into your beard then oil leave 20 mins and rinse BOOM
5744 2018-09-20 14:40:46 American Shale oil and Natural Gas !!! We don’t need Middle East!!! #ThankyouMrPresident
5745 2018-09-20 14:40:34 Right. That’s why he jails opposition or refuses to accept  election results, people are starving and he sold country’s future oil reserves to China..

5749 2018-09-20 14:40:13 Pakeee bio oil .....
5750 2018-09-20 14:40:11 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
5751 2018-09-20 14:40:08 Oil prices are caused by speculators, not OPEC. Oil would be supply and demand, like gold and silver would be, if naked shorts and longs weren't allowed to operate. Now the tail wags the dog, prices determine demand.
5752 2018-09-20 14:40:08 Let’s remember that the Seven Sisters oil cartel (an extension of western power) controlled and exploited these nations before they unified under OPEC. Maybe we should just become less dependent on oil, no?
5753 2018-09-20 14:40:03 If an exploratory oil drilling venture went down vertically 1200 feet, then horizontal for 3275 feet, with a 12 inch bore, what would that do to the earths barometric pressure and what would the PH of the stratosphere be?
5754 2018-09-20 14:39:58 Aku liat temen aku pake bio oil

5760 2018-09-20 14:39:13 Looks like the MM's have it figured out now $TLRY $CGC maybe the $MJ ETF is big enough for them to do the same scam they do in Oil or Semi's (Sell the stock, sell the ETF, becomes self Fulfilling) @nanexllc
5761 2018-09-20 14:39:03 To be fair, talksport usually run a negative story on SPURS daily! Let's see how badly Adrian Durham's criticism of oil city is today! He'll probably blame pochetinno! SPURS were unlucky in the San siro! City were outplayed by Lyon at the emptyhad
5762 2018-09-20 14:39:01 He's got endless money to protects oil rich Muslim countries that are Sharia compliant. Can't find any money to keep his so called promises.  You gotta be stupid to call this man honest.

5769 2018-09-20 14:38:20 God bless you Ma'am. The intention of her visit was to report sensational news, that's why they won't report those positive sides. If she wants to do a report on churches that are selling Olive Oil to members, she's free to so that but in this case, she got it wrong. So I insist
5770 2018-09-20 14:38:20 オリジナルーな話で混ぜこみたいだけで本人は触れてないです
5771 2018-09-20 14:38:12 3000 was the standard for older vehicles.  New vehicles vary based on the oil types. Most oil is good for 4,000-7,500 miles but synthetic oils can be rated for up to 20,000.  Most service techs recommend the 4,000-5,000 today for most vehicles
5772 2018-09-20 14:38:11 Time for a oil change on my truck

5776 2018-09-20 14:37:53 What does the price of oil have to do with protecting our allies?
5777 2018-09-20 14:37:52 โน
5778 2018-09-20 14:37:41 It won't benefit turkey it will benefit Saudi as they'll install oil refiners to export their own oil to China and mid Asian nation
5779 2018-09-20 14:37:34 Good example is Exxon ,they buy oil from OPEC at $70 a barrel in their own tankers, sit off shore of US wait til demand spikes & market prices hit $100 then sell it at that price to their OWN  refineries.Sell that marked up refined gas to Americans then blame OPEC for high prices
5780 2018-09-20 14:37:29 my dad waited until he ran out of oil to give me his car 
5781 2018-09-20 14:37:21 I agree with you on this. We need to start slowly phasing out fossil fuels, and invest into cleaner energy that will help us maintain a better standard of living. Eventually, oil will run out and we must be prepared for this. #Valles2020 #Veteran #cometogether #keepitreal

5787 2018-09-20 14:36:53 Why would anyone take the opinion of the idiot that wanted to sell off public land seriously? Hey red state hunters, while your distracted with some bullshit wall these guys tried to sell off your Elk hunting land to oil and gas companies. Wake up?
5788 2018-09-20 14:36:45 High oil prices are the only thing that makes our domestic oil industry viable.  Who knew?   Clearly not you!
5789 2018-09-20 14:36:43 How much oil do we export then look up how much we have in the ground. You are a little slow on this but the US is currently using other peoples oil up that will eventually run out then who has all the oil. It’s strategy not necessity. Lol I import my water from Lake Keowee.
5790 2018-09-20 14:36:24 Yess I use coconut oil, heard that mixing castor oil w Rosemary oil is good too. And some Argan oil hair mask.
5791 2018-09-20 14:36:21 Yes, I’ve watched this emerging industry since Cali went medicinal. Thought we’d be passed the arrests and incarcerations but the powers that be flipped the script. All southern states with CBD oil laws on the books are preparing to bank yet are still arresting state residents.

5808 2018-09-20 14:35:04 Back to  'OIL'  ;'  When it came to the dis-covery of crude oil resources within, India specially in the GANGATIC plain, the 7 sisters were more concerned with expending their resources in areas of greater priority to ' THEM ' (WEST ASIA, NORTH/ CENTRAL AFRICA) than in India.
5809 2018-09-20 14:35:01 Google
How much we subsidize oil. Free info.
5810 2018-09-20 14:34:58 Now costs will go up with the trade war. No plans for reducing the deficit or the crippling cost for health care. Any long term goals?  Where is the USA in 100 years?  Yes, North America.  What about oil, electricity?
5811 2018-09-20 14:34:56 If you hadn’t made an enemy of Canada maybe you could make a deal with them for more oil.
5812 2018-09-20 14:34:53 Not just in Indonesia even the neighbour country Malaysia have massive palm oil plantation. Last time I visited ipoh a large part of mountain was burned.
5813 2018-09-20 14:34:48 Or only sell what we can transport and get paid a fair price for it instead of making promises we can't keep.

You think India is going to replace Iranian oil with AB oil? Have you looked at a map?

5814 2018-09-20 14:34:46 I will pray for you.
5815 2018-09-20 14:34:35 Your foolish actions towards Iran along with your war mongering are feeding higher oil prices - Not fit to be President - Go have another dance with the Saudi King & Princes That is a sure way towards higher & higher oil prices

5819 2018-09-20 14:34:03 2a/2 once OPEC starts tightening production, thus lessoning OPEC's cartel power and forcing them to compete on price with US produced oil. So not only are you complaining for OPEC raising crude prices, which the subsidize for their own citizens, you continue to tax us in the US
5820 2018-09-20 14:33:56 I can’t wait to do this deep condition & hot oil my hair
5821 2018-09-20 14:33:52 WHICH middle-east countries are you actually protecting? Correct, those  that produce oil and gas and willing to sell it in USD only.
5822 2018-09-20 14:33:50 Do you know #Iran is part of #OPEC?  Maybe you need to charge #OPEC ministers even more when they stay at your DC hotel... like a tanker full of oil per night but payable to US Treasury not you!!!
5823 2018-09-20 14:33:49 idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but....

get an oil change 
5824 2018-09-20 14:33:49 I thought you were trying to drive oil prices up, so Putin could recover his investment? And help payback the money you borrowed from him!
5825 2018-09-20 14:33:41 There's no reason to justify this act,first as a human ,then as lady for that matter, well I dont blame her ,maybe she hasn't experienced what a broken home impacts on a child.
5826 2018-09-20 14:33:38 Being off this week my truck needed an oil change. Thanks again Candy and @kitchenerford for the great service.

We need real climate leadership. #GCAS2018 #BrownsLastChance
5836 2018-09-20 14:32:53 You don't & never have protected middle East countries, you protect your oil interests only. Opec has many times reduced oil costs while increasing output. US countries buy oil cheap then jack market prices in US & blame these prices on OPEC. It's Corporate theft not OPEC.
5837 2018-09-20 14:32:50 I thought about asking them for it, need my oil changed soon anyway
5838 2018-09-20 14:32:49 The city is aware of the burnt oil odor in Plymouth – and there is no danger to the public. The odor originated from an oil distilling process at a company on the 14000 block of 27th Avenue N. The process has been shut down while the company resolves the issue.

5841 2018-09-20 14:32:38 Saying that you "continue to insist" cannot change the claims she brought forward. You've got to do better. She said she interviewed a woman selling oil and books written by Bishop Oyedepo on behalf of the church, on the property owned by the Living Faith Church.
5842 2018-09-20 14:32:26 So indirectly Saudis take 1st baby step towards a different future, which may eventually result in de dollarization of oil trade as Chinese want it.
5843 2018-09-20 14:32:25 I got off it this week before the Paris trip, but I’ll be going back on after.

It’s lots of healthy fats so avocado, cheese, Greek yogurt, bacon, butter, salads with olive oil.
5844 2018-09-20 14:32:23 Nigeria Air has crashed. When are we going to know if the search for oil in Bornu has also crashed. Unenlightened leadership is a curse

5850 2018-09-20 14:32:06 Umm, America is the biggest oil producer in the world.....
5851 2018-09-20 14:32:04 If you'd move strongly to renewables, you wouldn't have to worry about Middle East oil prices.
5852 2018-09-20 14:31:54 Our media is controlled by extreme left wing owners ( would be interesting to see besides CBC, who the owners and share holders of our media outlets....oil money?) ...this is news that people want to hear and should have been aired #cbc #ctv #global #globeandmail #torontostar
5853 2018-09-20 14:31:50 Because he only learned that America can't supply its own demand for oil recently.

Also, he couldn't push forth a new charge on gas to pay off the $1 trillion he added to the National Debt. Gas prices were too high to do so.
5854 2018-09-20 14:31:48 The 15 reg might hold on paper, but there will be ample waivers — or no one at the EPA who enforces anything.  We’re already over 18... & who’s enforcing?  Nobody.  We need more oil in light of IR sanctions + Permian.  Bakken can deliver w/o reg. It will.
5855 2018-09-20 14:31:47 Let’s boycott oil!! Burn it all in protest!!

5863 2018-09-20 14:31:26 I agree, this city has no imagination its ok to conserve historic sites & our past but cant we also live in the present and the future ,My Brother owns an oil related Business in Edmonton & wanted to set up shop in ST Johns but went to Halifax where it was Business friendly

5867 2018-09-20 14:31:07 They could pay us for their protection with Dollars or Oil!  They can well afford US protection!
5868 2018-09-20 14:31:04 Listen, all I am saying is "report facts". There are thousands of vendors on that premises every week. Are they all selling on behalf of the church? Her tweet says "...church selling blessed olive oil...". That's an erroneous statement

5870 2018-09-20 14:30:55 You can forget the green energy stuff. As long as the American dollar is tied to OPEC oil Americans will be slaves of the oil industry.
5871 2018-09-20 14:30:55 Oil is dead, just like coal.
5872 2018-09-20 14:30:54 The no deal that these treacherous snake oil salesmen in the Tory party have been working towards the while time. Goodbye NHS, goodbye workers rights and hello massive windfalls for the Tories and their rich pals. Bastards.
5873 2018-09-20 14:30:51 Declassify t studies already performed. This Gov has a history of suppression on potential medical advancements. Why? Those advancements R God's, big business can't patent it. No money in it but 90% effective? CLASSIFIED. Snake oil salesmen with drugs that do more harm than good
5874 2018-09-20 14:30:48 the state are raising the IGR but can not be  enough to meet there domestic obligations.
the Issue should not be discuss in isolation  of the fact that Oil is Nigeria main resource.
the FG need to bring that benefit down to the generating unit.
5875 2018-09-20 14:30:47 LOL at nutritional sectarisms.

i.e. carnivore crew rejecting to use olive oil, blueberries or hazelnuts because they are not animals and stating they damage you. Total bullshit.

Air India is in loss, We are still importing 80% of our oil From gulf countries,  instead he promised electric cars...Shame shame shame
5881 2018-09-20 14:30:17 Yes. One tactic that is used to keep profit high is:

Privatize the profits and Socialize the expenses.

For an oil company that means: buy a cheap lease and keep the oil profits. Pay as little as possible for labor. When you're finished, don't clean it up; make the public do it.
5882 2018-09-20 14:30:13 Said the person who waited till it was at -1,000 miles to get her oil changed. Mines at -10 so don’t even

5890 2018-09-20 14:29:31 The government will keep troops in Afghan for control and oil. But can’t help at all with this, instead we all fill big company’s and the elite pockets.
5891 2018-09-20 14:29:29 If this had the proper spelling of whose I would totally retweet it bc I def need an oil change

And I am talking about the Saudi want this war to push oil lines into Syria. This war we started to help the Saudi’s

5902 2018-09-20 14:28:38 Nobody minds a reasonable tax l. But govt making fool of all. First excuse was funds for growth, then hi intl oil prices, then oil bonds of UPA, then state taxes, then hi $/ exch rate. This becoming another demonitisation type litany of excuses.
5903 2018-09-20 14:28:38 Hahhahaha that makes me feel better ive added two quarts to the mini since its last oil change
5904 2018-09-20 14:28:32 As usual, @realDonaldTrump is scapegoating by laying blame on OPEC which plays well with his base. But the truth is trump set in motion rising oil prices the minute he tore up the Iran deal for political purposes @Goss30Goss @13WJM @jonbonscott2 @JohnJHarwood @TeaPainUSA
5905 2018-09-20 14:28:28 I'll see your oil industry control and raise you one indicted Attorney General (Ken Paxton).
5906 2018-09-20 14:28:26 Fact! No matter wat He wont stop dng so. If he stop he has 2involve in HM panjaith. Which he dont like 2do unless if anything against Mumo he will loves to involve not to solve but 2add more oil on to it by encouraging his Dumbo gang + he will give his lvl best to put her down
5907 2018-09-20 14:28:19 Dumb comment!  We don’t protect them. We use them. We need to buy less oil and use less oil.

5912 2018-09-20 14:27:52 Also logically these eligius 3 people were sent to find oil. They weren’t sent to make a whole new city. So they wouldn’t have the resources to build concrete cities.
5913 2018-09-20 14:27:46 They said an hour wait for an oil change...bro. No
5914 2018-09-20 14:27:41 My oil changes on my civic consist of putting a fresh quart in every month or so, I’ve never actually changed it since I’ve owned it

5917 2018-09-20 14:27:36 I’d stick to CBD oil instead bc kratom acts as an opioid in your brain, activating those receptors.

5921 2018-09-20 14:27:14 .@RebootWithJoe  Hemp for human consumption is now legal in Oz.

5922 2018-09-20 14:27:11 The economy is bouncing back, our foreign reserves are going up. The past administration depleted our foreign reserves despite the enormous oil revenue Nigerian was earning for that period.
5923 2018-09-20 14:27:11 Are you really this stupid or ... never mind you really are this stupid. Sexual assault IS wrong. Period. Owls? Ummm WTF? Guns?

5951 2018-09-20 14:25:39 "Protect"? I think you mean interfere. And our interference has much to do with higher oil prices. Not to mention their distrust and dislike of the U.S.
5952 2018-09-20 14:25:30 Seems to me that the United States is desperate for cash. Countries dumping US treasuries, Tarrifs on allies and enemies alike.  Now insisting on lower oil price. I don't think the world is listening, do you?

5971 2018-09-20 14:23:43 Mr. President Trump, while you are at it can you tell us why the DOLLAR is being SLAMMED down and why American's are being ROBBED by big oil.
5972 2018-09-20 14:23:42 What happened to your big plan of using everything AMERICAN MADE. 

Doesn't AMERICA have oil?

You remember your words. AMERICA comes FIRST. 

I guess your AMERICA FIRST was just a way for you, your administration, the GOP and the 1% to make money and to hell with ALL AMERICANS.
5973 2018-09-20 14:23:41 And then OPEC floods the market and frackers go belly up. We've been here before. Low prices keep shale oil off the market.
5974 2018-09-20 14:23:36 Our oil we do whatever we want with it, if you have money then pay, if not then someone else will 

You're a businessman you know how business works
5975 2018-09-20 14:23:35 Texans and @realDonaldTrump should remember: Higher oils prices mean jobs and tax revenue for Texas.

Saudi Arabia dropping oil prices and borrowing to fund their govt lead to job losses here. Foreclosures and reposession of newly purchased pickup trucks followed
5976 2018-09-20 14:23:33 @WSJopinion With oil prices on the rise, it would be nice to know what the breakeven cost of the producers is
5977 2018-09-20 14:23:24 So what you scared of then? Throughout history seller of snake oil have had lots of reasons why customers shouldn’t get their money back. It comes of knowing you conned people and are scared they’ve worked it out.
5978 2018-09-20 14:23:21 変態度で言えば私は鈴木鈴ウォッチャー程度だったからまだ軽度な部類ですね
5979 2018-09-20 14:23:18 Mr. President Trump, while you are at it can you tell us why the DOLLAR is being SLAMMED down and why American's are being ROBBED by big oil.

5987 2018-09-20 14:22:25 If there's no funding source then they cannot disclose whether or not there is a conflict of interest. It could have easily been funded by oil execs which don't want fossil fuels shut down.

5989 2018-09-20 14:22:17 And Energy East should be declared a matter of national security.  There is no way that we should allow our selves to be dependent on foreign oil when we have the resources here.  #Selfsufficiency

5995 2018-09-20 14:21:51 On the contrary, oil is sold very cheap compared to the prices of cars and machinery that you sell to the Middle East, let alone the looting companies that you manage in the Middle East and the high cost that you take for drilling and exploration, you are the head of a bandit

6000 2018-09-20 14:21:29 Isn't it time to break up the oil monopolies & get competition going? When we have competition they'll B less likely 2 raise oil prices unfairly 2 stay in business & sale oil!

6016 2018-09-20 14:20:12 There are literally hundreds of abandoned oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. An enterprising entrepreneur could turn those into solar/wind generation platforms and make a killing selling power to the coast. And retrain the oilfield workers to maintain.

6022 2018-09-20 14:19:58 So far 32 humans, about 3 million chickens, countless farm animals have died. Oil, coal ash and hog waste have run off in to natural waters. Gators, poisonous snakes and fire ants on the move. Hundreds of thousands can’t return home. Do you have any empathy for us?

6047 2018-09-20 14:18:10 Putin's true economic reliance is oil. He was flexing his military muscles because of the oil windfall he was getting so Obama made sure to keep oil prices down to tame Putin. No bullets were fired but the peace was kept. Putin halted his agression in Ukraine
6048 2018-09-20 14:18:09 also NONcannabis hemp oil (CBD = cannibidiol, chemical similarity with out the THC, what makes you stoned) is extremely helpful, where legalization is not an issue, if you have a whole foods co-op, or natural foods/health shop?

6059 2018-09-20 14:17:03 I only use conditioner unless my roots get super visibly greasy, even then I only shampoo my roots. Conditioner and warm water pulls dirt and excess oil out of your hair without stripping it too much. Try a shampoo that has argan or some other type of oil when you need it !
6060 2018-09-20 14:17:03 This is how Congress created Rs. 150,000 Cr. bond debt is paid. In Congress time also it happened that Oil price reached to Rs. 82 and so was the Oil Bond debt! The petrol should Rs. 200 / liter, did you not see how ppl were moving in mask due to pollution?

6076 2018-09-20 14:16:02 You’re trying to keep oil prices high to help US fracking industry, which needs oil above $80-$100 a barrel to be profitable or attract investment. And then you want to blame the high prices on OPEC so voters won’t be passed off.
6077 2018-09-20 14:16:01 I Gotta Get An Oil Change & Alignment Asap
6078 2018-09-20 14:15:51 Ohhh. They don't wash their hair every day like I do. It's thin, fine and oily. I got in the habit of it when it was short, and my hair would oil up after just a day.
6079 2018-09-20 14:15:32 Most of Middle East problem  Created by USA and France as well as the oil is very cheap, we sell a barrel of oil 60 US dollar and you sell small perfume 200 US dollar at least
6080 2018-09-20 14:15:32 Angola and south Sudan are the two countries to have mortgaged their future by signing over future oil production from China to repay loans. Zambia, Djibouti, and Congo Brazzaville are other debt distressed countries. We have learnt nothing from history

6084 2018-09-20 14:15:16 The US is the world's largest oil producer.  Why are we exporting oil while simultaneously importing it?  Why are tearing down automobile efficiency targets?

6103 2018-09-20 14:13:10 Thank you Mr. President. The reasonable value is 65USD where the demand and supply coincides. Oil using countries will be able to import other items from US. Otherwise we, India will be spending only on oil and middle east countries will use excess oil money for terror funding.
6104 2018-09-20 14:13:08 I thought we buy little oil from them. US is awash in oil from fracking.  Tell OPEC to bugger off.
6105 2018-09-20 14:13:05 trump put sanctions on two founding members of OPEC with the largest and fourth largest proven oil reserves, started a trade war with Canada who has the third largest proven oil reserves and then tries to blame others for the rise in oil prices.
6106 2018-09-20 14:13:03 Do you realise the similarity between Water when you are showering and the Oil you use for frying? 
Both of them are wasted once they touch the object they are being used for.
6107 2018-09-20 14:12:51 They got you by the short hairs and there is nothing you can do. Oil money bankrolls ISIS and you are inable to stop it.  Why do you think Russia is helping Syria - to buy and sell oil, it is their gateway to Middle East oil control.
6108 2018-09-20 14:12:47 ？？？「興行のために続けろ」
6109 2018-09-20 14:12:47 We need to do something about the price of oil. It’s another place where the American public is getting raped.

6115 2018-09-20 14:12:29 This is BS. Our presence in Middle East drives up oil prices. Sanctions on Iran and Russia drive up oil prices - which is your goal.

You’re not conning anyone with this claim - which is new for you. You never used to think like this. Big disappointment.
6116 2018-09-20 14:12:27 Yes!!! My husband has worked in oil and gas for 30 years. Lost his job because of Obama policies. He's now back at work and making 3 times what he was making just 1 year ago.
6117 2018-09-20 14:12:25 This is art. Somebody paint that on a canvas like a renaissance oil painting and sell it as on tshirts. Boom your rich now - give me 0,1% of your wealth - i gave you the idea.

6122 2018-09-20 14:12:14 You have no fucking clue where the bulk of oil comes from. Canada is your main supplier. You’re so unfit and inept to do this job. Resign!
6123 2018-09-20 14:12:00 Time to order DOE Secretary Rick Perry to release more oil from the SPR?  Make it a significant release!  50-100M barrels (SPR is outdated, US can ramp up production in any national emergency, price spike)
6124 2018-09-20 14:11:59 We have more oil in 3 states then is in the middle east we need to drill and refine our own oil stop buying from other countries Buy and build in the US
6125 2018-09-20 14:11:57 I can't place the fact that all the Niger Delta States occupy the non enviable positions despite the earnings from oil revenue and the place remains sh**th@le.

6133 2018-09-20 14:11:38 We need to start refining our own oil here and become more independent of foreign oil!
6134 2018-09-20 14:11:37 Again, for those trying to confuse others with unfounded figures, please mention the infrastructure projects that was achieved under the past administration during the years when the global oil prices were over $100 a barrel?
6135 2018-09-20 14:11:27 Hey genius. If you pushed for energy that didn’t rely on fossil fuels like electric, solar, or wind power then high oil prices wouldn’t be an issue. Makes you think! Smart!

6138 2018-09-20 14:11:10 Prior to that, many legislative and local elections were held in Iraq, but they re-produced the product. Therefore, it did not open the way to solving the political, security and social dilemmas that the country is experiencing.
 It also poured oil on its fire.
6139 2018-09-20 14:11:00 OPEC is not a monopoly they represent 20% of  the worlds oil production. If you want to energy prices? Stop buying their oil and start investing in solar. BTW, Water is always very wet.
6140 2018-09-20 14:10:57 Is Oil our only resource? What about other sectors that are yet to receive the deserved attention?
6141 2018-09-20 14:10:46 no they hav a bigger problem with Iran than US .there is a theory abt Oil produced by IRAN tht the Oil slides down towards Pakistani side tht gonna hurt Iran economically if we gnna make oil city .

- You won't engage/assign @CommerceGov or @StateDept
- You won't strategize or start constructive dialog
- You won't identify common goals or negotiate possible incentives with oil producing nations

You'll tweet. #Trump
6144 2018-09-20 14:10:29 It's an artificially inflated Market propped up by your tax cuts to the super rich who instead of reinvesting in jobs & infrastructure pumped money back into the market to help the other 1 percenters! It means nothing for the MAJORITY of Americans! But keep selling the snake oil!
6145 2018-09-20 14:10:26 We need to talk about the broth. I use Old Man Que Huong Pho Bac Spice Seasoning. It’s a spice bag. You cook it on the stove without any oil. Get a nice char out of it before putting it in the bag. Char an onion too. It helps keep the broth clear. PM me, we should talk.

6155 2018-09-20 14:09:50 If there are no THC levels then the oil cannot be classed as a psychoactive drug, which would fall under banned substances, and I am 100% sure that they have not banned all aspects of the plant because Hemp would also be illegal.
Would you get 18 years in prison for giving dill?
6156 2018-09-20 14:09:39 Oil, traders still think Canada can get it to market.

6169 2018-09-20 14:08:58 Nobody would care about their oil if people like you weren't in charge.  If you lower the demand for a product, what happens to the price, genius?
6170 2018-09-20 14:08:40 Does he realise that USA is by far the largest producer of petroleum in the world and the biggest oil companies are from  US.
6171 2018-09-20 14:08:39 As long as you have added oil you shouldn’t but get one soon.
6172 2018-09-20 14:08:37 TOTH: SPX gaps up on open & runs higher, new market highs today.
OIL 15M struggles with 70.70=pivot, 1H 20MA=70=resist. Should move up. WATCH

6185 2018-09-20 14:07:53 It has been ingrained in our transport lives, certainly: an unnecessarily complex oil-bathed motor that runs on oil tyres on an oil-slick road has been the perfect outlet for the product the oil companies have to sell.

You will rid yourself of being held hostage by oil producers.
The best revenge is to no longer need fossil fuels.

6193 2018-09-20 14:07:25 It re-applied heavy sanctions on Iran that reduced the competition of where countries can buy oil from. Econ101: If supply goes down and demand remains the same, prices go up. #doyourhomework #LiarInChief
6194 2018-09-20 14:07:20 She does not but she used to! Apparently something changed with the tomatoes — too acidic?! 

She has me sauté garlic, onions, salt, pepper, and pancetta in olive oil and then pours the tomatoes in. She mashes the tomatoes with a pounder and cooks for 25 minutes.
6195 2018-09-20 14:07:17 Mr. President Trump, while you are at it can you tell us why the DOLLAR is being SLAMMED down and why American's are being ROBBED by big oil.

6204 2018-09-20 14:06:22 Yes because in exchange for our protection they give us boots on the ground and military bases that allow us to act on terrorist regimes quickly. Without THEIR help we would be in the dark about middle east activity. Also oil prices went up bc YOU violated the Iran agreement.

6211 2018-09-20 14:05:55 There are actually some essential oils and synthetic ingredients that are genuinely beneficial to the skin (e.g. sandalore: helps healing; many antifungal and antibacterial ingredients; chemicals present in chamomile blue oil, etc, etc)... formulating for skin benefit is a thing.
6212 2018-09-20 14:05:54 Don't Blame Governors 
many of them are working considering the number of project executed.
the FGN is to be blame.
a Country like Nigeria can not continue to survive in 2million barrels of oil per year.
ordinary Angola is producing over 4 million barrels of oil
6213 2018-09-20 14:05:47 Total energy independence solves many problems.  OPEC, European dependence on Russian pipeline, boosts the economy, provides jobs.  Without oil money the middle east is just a lot of sand and Russia cant feed its own population
6214 2018-09-20 14:05:41 I must state facts again: the vendor sells olive oil on the property of “Living Faith Church”, authorized by the church to do so, including books by Pastor Oyedepo on church behalf. You can continue to disagree but stop making false comments. It wastes precious time.
6215 2018-09-20 14:05:35 Both give me major headaches so personally yes  but really no it's literally just like the oil and flavor I had a friend who's dad made juice
6216 2018-09-20 14:05:32 Thank you. Now, with all these refineries, and all this oil right near those refineries with all this excess capacity, could it possibly be a matter of oil companies' policies rather than a shortage of infrastructure keeping Canadian gas prices high?
6217 2018-09-20 14:05:31 Mr. President Trump, while you are at it can you tell us why the DOLLAR is being SLAMMED down and why American's are being ROBBED by big oil.
6218 2018-09-20 14:05:09 French Total needs an election asap as Italian eni is reigning supreme in looting Libyan oil.
6219 2018-09-20 14:04:44 We need to get away from oil and the idea of using coal at this point is just ridiculous. I don’t care how much money their lobbyists give you. Solar and electric are the future. We won’t need anything from the middle east.
6220 2018-09-20 14:04:41 we are the largest producer of oil. Its pretty much all on you now.  You own this mess.
6221 2018-09-20 14:04:39 The #MeToo movement has to resonate all over the world...especially in the oil rich countries...
6222 2018-09-20 14:04:31 One day there will be no more oil or gas and you will be kings of empty holes in a polluted earth. Will you blame the people then?
6223 2018-09-20 14:04:29 Mr. President Trump, while you are at it can you tell us why the DOLLAR is being SLAMMED down and why American's are being ROBBED by big oil.
6224 2018-09-20 14:04:27 Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday that they are ok with oil at $80 and speculators quickly pushed it that way.

6232 2018-09-20 14:03:39 High oil prices aren’t a bad thing...importing oil from the middle east is the issue when we have plenty of o&g reserves here domestically.
6233 2018-09-20 14:03:36 Supply is only one piece of price. Time for journalists to look at speculation impact on oil prices. Could be significant, but seems to be ignored since 2014 drop.
6234 2018-09-20 14:03:29 Yet...you crushed the efforts for alternative energy funding which would have made us less dependent on ME oil companies...SAD 
6235 2018-09-20 14:03:25 Mindfulness, meditation, marijuana, CBD oil, and neurofeedback are but a few things that should and do take the place of synthetics.
6236 2018-09-20 14:03:19 We have destroyed many parts of the Middle East in the name of oil.
6237 2018-09-20 14:03:16 No we DO NOT protect the oil producing countries. America keeps the dictators stay on power.
6238 2018-09-20 14:03:04 Oil price & US stock price always move together.
If oil price is down, stock price will go south.

I would let the oil price be determined in the market.

Trump would rather not be S.Korea, who is helping N.Korea at the cost of the S.Korean economy. (Big Lesson!)

6253 2018-09-20 14:01:35 I’m in Washington rn and the boss got a phone call this morning saying we have to go help clean up a spill because a dumbass farmer punctured the oil pipeline. So we are currently driving back to Idaho which will take 5-6 hours to work for probably 8 or more hours. FUN!!
6254 2018-09-20 14:01:34 OPEC isn't a monopoly! There are other oil producers, USA, Russia and more.  And "So shall it be said, so shall it be done"?  This guy thinks he's an ancient Egyptian king.
Ignorant and egotistical.
6255 2018-09-20 14:01:26 Unconscionable that oil and gas interests have free rein to run roughshod over citizens everywhere, sapping and endangering our water resources simultaneously.

6260 2018-09-20 14:01:11 I highly doubt Trump knows anything about how oil prices affect Russia. He may have been told but he doesn’t listen.
6261 2018-09-20 14:01:07 I doubt focus on green energy is motivated by environmental concerns-  More likely economic.  Breaking their dependency on foreign coal gas + oil  by switching to domestically produced solar. Environmental benefits are likely "nice to have" instead of the driving principle.
6262 2018-09-20 14:01:04 Weren't you in a tweet less than two months ago touting how your buddy in Saudi Arabia promised to pump millions of barrels of oil to lower prices just because you asked him to and how wonderful he was and by extension how wonderful you were?  ANOTHER LIE.

6352 2018-09-20 13:54:46 they do this at oil express also. 4% charge. that’s insane!!!!!
6353 2018-09-20 13:54:38 During 2013 the per barrel crude oil price was much less even then UPA didn't lowered cost on petrol that's the reason why bjp opposed then. Now even per barrel price is higher then cost on petrol is RS 3-4 higher when compared to UPA's time petrol cost. Need more info now?
6354 2018-09-20 13:54:37 And switching to green energy (a change we should've made years ago) would effectively poke a hole in the carbon bubble, forcing the world to decrease the value of oil. Its current market value is so high because they've falsely assumed demand will continue until oil is depleted.

6363 2018-09-20 13:54:15 @PMOIndia.
Just an idea. Why tax on petrol and diesel can be variable based on crude oil price. More the crude oil price less the tax%.  Some formulae can be worked out so that absolute tax collection will remain almost same. This should be applicable to states also.

No one should fool themselves- this govt does not care about *anyone’s* job.

6412 2018-09-20 13:49:43 You are 100 % right Barron. Of course OPEC should get oil prices down immediately. The relationship between America Military protection with this countries and the oil prices should be a reciprocal one.
6413 2018-09-20 13:49:39 Once one #POTUS has let the "OPEC-is-a-monopoly" genie out the bottle, doesn't it embolden all presidents (and #Congress) to react to #monopoly power? And isn't #OPEC in the process of taking bids (from #Russia, #China) for a new "protection" contract? #oil #OilPricingByTweet
6414 2018-09-20 13:49:29 Not so fast, gov is getting into crypto reg , so it gonna more like gold, oil price suppression to me rather than parabolic run, also a stock market crash is coming next ,followed by recession.I can only tell you this : stay liquid my friend.
6415 2018-09-20 13:49:23 Oil blotting papers really do a good job of humbling you smh I’m DISGUSTING
6416 2018-09-20 13:49:21 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
6417 2018-09-20 13:49:19 Me too!! My last one I literally got the most expensive oil change and filled my tank then totaled it 
6418 2018-09-20 13:49:13 Renewable energy is about the only thing that will drive oil prices down. Pulling troops out of the middle east will not only make it less safe, but will also make us less safe.

6421 2018-09-20 13:49:02 WW that’s the oil motherload right there
6422 2018-09-20 13:49:01 Get our own resources going.We have untapped oil supplies.They won’t have a customer and then they will come down in price .
6423 2018-09-20 13:48:55 It’s a used motor oil kind of day, folks
6424 2018-09-20 13:48:50 I wonder what they smell like. I’m imagining oil and complaints.
6425 2018-09-20 13:48:49 No. If actual T has gone up .8C since 1880 how is forecast of +3C since 1960 amazingly accurate? What the hell is wrong with your reading skills? This shows that the oil companies hired idiots too.
6426 2018-09-20 13:48:34 Friday I will be subbing for Rich oil Downtown as he will be in Michigan to cover the Maine Central Michigan game on Saturday--all the Friday regulars plus Rich and Bob Lucy will check in from Lansing to break down the upcoming game.
6427 2018-09-20 13:48:25 For real. That’s us: with the added benefit that we don’t even bother to get our spray certification (which is MORE money) so the only stuff we can use is like aqueous copper and horticultural oil (that’s just cooking oil in an emulsion).
6428 2018-09-20 13:48:24 Oil prices drawing labour west? WTI had been steadily rising in price since 2003 at that point.
6429 2018-09-20 13:48:20 So what I’m saying here is we won’t protect you if you charge us more for oil.  That’s about the smartest move, what happens without oil?  Can’t get any from Canada because they are unfriended now #WorstPresidentEver #TraitorTrumpIsTheEnemyOfThePeople

6435 2018-09-20 13:47:58 Do you realize that we control 2/3 of the world's oil. Someone please take his phone.

6441 2018-09-20 13:47:01 Then why are we protecting them?  Bring our troops home and stop purchasing oil from them.  Done, see how easy that is
6442 2018-09-20 13:46:59 Trump Tweet:
We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!

We dont want to import or export oil.

6448 2018-09-20 13:46:12 I have a hard time falling asleep more then the nightmares now.  Can’t turn my brain off. I started taking CBD oil for my anxiety and it has helped. When I finally fall a sleep, I sleep good.
6449 2018-09-20 13:46:05 Obviously putin has blocked off the access to the black sea where oil is and is also protecting his naval base.
6450 2018-09-20 13:45:57 भाई तूने oil sand का नाम सुना है? रेत से तेल तो निकलता है! ये तो सही है की मेहनत करने वाले का सम्मान नहीं है पर तू सक्षम लोगों के लिये आरक्षण माँगकर उन्हें ख़ुद ही अपमानित कर रहा है
6451 2018-09-20 13:45:53 Ah IOT in oil and gas was this week here in Houston and containers came into many discussions and was split audience understanding as well.
6452 2018-09-20 13:45:44 OPEC would be worse off if oil prices are low.
6453 2018-09-20 13:45:42 You’re no oil painting yourself! And in my opinion you’re not handsome,just a regular jerk passing off being overweight as muscle! Get a life and get some manners while you’re there!!!

6456 2018-09-20 13:45:36 Trump demands OPEC reduce their prices so we can have cheap oil, but complains about countries that sell us cheap steel and other goods, only to slap tariffs on them.
6457 2018-09-20 13:45:31 Slap some tariffs on that oil! That will show them you mean business!
6458 2018-09-20 13:45:30 I used CBD Oil on Day 1 of my last cycle & after a little pain from standing, I was able to drive 4.5hrs to Tallahassee, stay out at Walmart with my sister til 3am (LOL) & enjoy my weekend cramp-FREE. Imma try it again this cycle to see if it’ll do it again for me 
6459 2018-09-20 13:45:28 Arab overtake at my club needed. The good thing will be that no one will chat shit like 'Oil money11' because our history is rich. We'll just become more powerful.
6460 2018-09-20 13:45:25 Care to explain why or just pretend that he wasn't talking about how raising oil prices from OPEC nations would create a problem?

We are the largest producer now, I think, but he isn't wrong.
6461 2018-09-20 13:45:19 Close. 

I put a tablespoon of coconut oil and two tablespoons of peanut butter into a blender with a banana, mix of frozen fruit, almond milk, protein powder, and a scoop of powdered carbs haha

Your surname is the only honest thing about you, @JeffFlake 
PS I still cringe when the memory of sitting next to you on a plane for surfaces. Hypocrite. Snake oil salesman. Worthless.
6465 2018-09-20 13:45:10 I did try it. Powder and pills. I had a bad reaction to it. I’ve heard from so many how much it helps them. My body over reacts to everything. CBD oil didn’t do anything for me. I don’t know what to do.
6466 2018-09-20 13:45:07 I don’t mind going to the dealership. Other than oil changes it dies not cost me money. Today they fix my exhaust I broke and replaced the O2censor I blew out. Did the recall in my tail gate cost me zero dollars  bumper to bumper warranty baby xD
6467 2018-09-20 13:45:06 The “bad policy” called “the global collapse of oil and gas prices“.

6475 2018-09-20 13:44:21 Mr. President, you know that US merchants dont agree with low oil prices but I agree that without US they wont be safe. Let them solve their dispute and  see to who they are going to sell it to ! Then they will be begging US. to buy from them . And then is the time for US. to buy
6476 2018-09-20 13:44:11 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
6477 2018-09-20 13:44:10 ah okay, veggie oil it is then

6479 2018-09-20 13:43:51 Know it sounds weird but putting a menthol based ointment on the bottom of the feet helps with congestion too.  - eucalyptus oil, vapor rubs, rosemary oil. Takes a touch longer to work, but the effect last longer. Feel better soon!
6480 2018-09-20 13:43:51 Extremely surprised at muted reaction to Prov Res #PVR farm in confirm today. IT is a de facto 7 well package worth upto $200m and the stock rise is incomprehensible to us. We suspect ongoing seller nearing the end, Remains a compelling Buy to us. #oil
6481 2018-09-20 13:43:50 You kind of have to be in the marching band to know about this but why does no one in the entire band have any valve oil?! The third valve on my baritone is totally useless and I can only play half the notes! Plus there isn’t a music store in the whole county! What the heck! 
6482 2018-09-20 13:43:48 Opec is not a monopoly.  The US HAS THE ABILITY to set US OIL PRICES.
6483 2018-09-20 13:43:48 Let’s promote wind and solar energy as well as mass transit and bicycle infrastructure so we don’t need to rely on foreign oil. 
6484 2018-09-20 13:43:46 Population growth alone suggests demand for oil not going to stop growing anytime soon. Throw in the huge amounts of energy needed to continue lifting living standards of billions of people in developing countries, and it's not hard to see how demand growth continues for decades.
6485 2018-09-20 13:43:42 If you give a shit that we're 12 years away from the point of no return on runaway global climate change, what you notice is that the Dems are only marginally better on that issue. The Paris Accord notwithstanding, both parties have supported oil development.
6486 2018-09-20 13:43:34 Lizzo’s Coconut Oil EP is... still that girl.
6487 2018-09-20 13:43:30 *BREAKING: Trump says the 'OPEC monopoly', whose countries would not be safe without the US, must lower prices.*
*We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices!
6488 2018-09-20 13:43:27 :)
6489 2018-09-20 13:43:24 Never had either. It's called good genes and olive oil. My parents look like they're 40...and all our faces still move.
6490 2018-09-20 13:43:00 US oil drillers are probably thrilled
6491 2018-09-20 13:42:58 @Nidhi fantastic reply by Mr.Roy to your one sided question on oil prices.
6492 2018-09-20 13:42:54 I made hummus but substituted a little olive oil instead of tahini, cuz that stuff's expensive. So I guess it's hummish?
6493 2018-09-20 13:42:53 just trying to get an oil change this morning.
6494 2018-09-20 13:42:48 Face oil bukannya?
6495 2018-09-20 13:42:43 The only down side is they have made a product that is so ingrained in our every day lives that all commerce would cease. The economy of the world is hinged on the price of a barrel of oil. It's going to take a long time (too long?) to change it now.
6496 2018-09-20 13:42:41 Suggest more focus on renewable energies. We are HOGs on oil.
6497 2018-09-20 13:42:38 As you said the other day that the US is now the largest supplier of Oil, then why don't you start by lowering the US prices.
6498 2018-09-20 13:42:21 Oui, les indications sont rarement précises et il faut toujours être à l'affût! Par contre, "castor oil" c'est l'huile de ricin, donc pas de problèmes à ce niveau là au moins!

Does your child play soccer or other outdoor games? Keep the bugs off while their playing by using Plant Therapy's Shield Me essential oil synergy. Available in drops ($11.95 +tax) and pre diluted roll on ($9.95 +tax).
6502 2018-09-20 13:41:58 Might be a good idea to piss off the world's oil producers like Iraq, China, Venezuela,

6504 2018-09-20 13:41:55 Trade security for oil. No oil, let them fend for themselves.
6505 2018-09-20 13:41:55 I’m talking about access to capital in the oil industry. No one is investing in Canada’s oil industry because (primarily) our federal government is creating a lot of uncertainty and it looks like it’s getting worse (Bill C69).
6506 2018-09-20 13:41:54 コスプレすれば限定だって迎えられる
6507 2018-09-20 13:41:51 Well, U cant say the oil market is NOT rigged. Just like the diamond market, they withhold tons of supply 2 drive up costs. If OPEC actually kept producing at a consistent rate, we would B drowning N oil & it would B half the cost. But no, they hold the line & raise price/barrel
6508 2018-09-20 13:41:45 Husqvarna mower-1 month and oil leaks. wow. When I'm not writing, I like to mow the yard. Disappointed with Husqvarna - name brand with high price and not a good product.
6509 2018-09-20 13:41:38 Gas prices always rise under Republicans. Recall that it was $4.00 per gallon under Bush. The oil companies know the Republicans will do nothing and take advantage.

6512 2018-09-20 13:41:37 Hahaha, don’t you know anything about economics?? If you are pushing out one of the top world suppliers of oil off the market (Iran), of course supply decreases and prices go up.

6514 2018-09-20 13:41:29 Hear why South Texas made for a good $2.66-billion investment, from the keynote speaker at #DUGEagleFord, Stephen Chazen, Chairman, President & CEO of Magnolia Oil & Gas Corp. @HartEnergyConf
6515 2018-09-20 13:41:29 Good for Goldman Sachs. 
But high oil prices are killing the middle class.
6516 2018-09-20 13:41:13 U.S. OIL STOCK PRICES SINK TO NEW LOWS. Following President Trump's 'shoot yourself in the foot' tirade against oil prices, apparently unaware that the US is the world's #1 producer, oil stocks dropped sharply Thursday as Trump continues to make huge mistakes, like his tariffs.
6517 2018-09-20 13:41:12 Agree unless he’s betting that not only Iranian oil will stop but also other in region leaving us and russsia in market which will boost us market
6518 2018-09-20 13:41:11 Heat of your hand to warm it or a little bit of. Baby oil
6519 2018-09-20 13:41:09 Higher oil prices and higher us dollar demand......
6520 2018-09-20 13:41:03 @realDonaldTrump OPEC wants benchmark prices, but realizes that if they try to get what they want, other competitors will step in to supply oil products at prices that are cheaper
6521 2018-09-20 13:41:00 Saudi arab officials will arrive next week, for a project worth 10 billion $ with Pakistan government to construct oil city in Gawadar.

6526 2018-09-20 13:40:24 This will definitely lower oil price.

6535 2018-09-20 13:39:41 Some cars are branded “lifetime oil” or “lifetime transmission fluid”. It’s a scam when they’re selling the car. I’ve replaced lots of engines due to oil, scum, and especially carbon buildup, because people don’t take them to be serviced.
6536 2018-09-20 13:39:31 The wife Wendy in the shining is the same actress who played Olive Oil!
6537 2018-09-20 13:39:29 Lmfao I’m long overdue for an oil change
6538 2018-09-20 13:39:27 @realDonaldTrump 
Today world oil prices are set by supply/demand factors and fear of conflicts.  OPEC does not set benchmark prices any more as there are competitors who will undercut them as they are no longer the HUGELY supplier of oil to the world market.
6539 2018-09-20 13:39:23 I have so much to do today!
Work out is complete 
Still have to:
Go to the gas company 
Get my oil changed

6540 2018-09-20 13:38:58 WHY are American Oil producers raising their prices????
WHY aren't YOU doing something about this???
Paying so much for home heating oil and natural gas will hurt American homeowners this Fall.
6541 2018-09-20 13:38:57 Yang waktu itu nyaranin pake baby oil sebelum pake anting, thanks yaaa.

IT WORKS! Hahahahha

Cuma emang kayanya kuping kiri ini lobangnya udah menciut, bisa gak sih digedein lagi gitu biar gak sakit kaya yang kanan? 
6542 2018-09-20 13:38:56 A Kimberly Protocol for oil?
6543 2018-09-20 13:38:55 One side is full of oil the other is not
6544 2018-09-20 13:38:41 Not with oil and gas companies though most are in the hole

6547 2018-09-20 13:38:23 Gonna be a great day today, getting a free oil change is always beautiful .
6548 2018-09-20 13:38:20 There is also gas, oil, animal and human feces all kinds of chemicals are in the drinking water after a flood it's been happening since forever. The public deserves to have the facts and just the facts not hype not embellishment and certainly not your opinion. Sad!

6550 2018-09-20 13:38:18 Chinese nod is definitely in they surely will be fine with this due to a possibility of Saudi oil directly being refined and shipped from Gwadar to China. Other than that possible arenas of cooperation and support are there but nothing linked with Afghan issue

6554 2018-09-20 13:38:11 Whatever choose to be blind if you decide to do so but this isnt a very well kept secret. Ask yourself who has the most to gain by Canadian oil not hitting the world market. It isnt  or Canadians I can tell you that much.
6555 2018-09-20 13:38:10 eminem beef w mgk is hilarious. a month ago if mgk did an interview nobody would have cared. today outlets are rushin to post quotes. diddy is a genius. he sponsors the show interviewing mgk & hes dropping an EP tn. mgk makes music for people that do oil changes at pep boys foh.
6556 2018-09-20 13:38:08 Man boi spending a cool huned at the oil change shop ain't what it is at all
6557 2018-09-20 13:38:07 When YOU pulled out of the Iran deal, Iran slowed down oil production, causing there to be a lower supply of oil on the market. Demand didn't change, so the price of oil went up. They didn't teach supply and demand at Wharton? It's YOUR fault that gas prices are going up.
6558 2018-09-20 13:38:05 I needed to see this  going on Saturday! Also Groupon has tons of oil change deals, I just got mine for $18 
6559 2018-09-20 13:38:02 Mom bought n adds nutrient powder from hare-today n adds fish oil also (just a capsule).  

We will try for all raw for kittens at either brekkies or supper. May cut into mah leftovers tho.
6560 2018-09-20 13:38:01 I’m an everyday Albertan who runs a small business in the oil sector and I think regardless of mine or anyone else’s political views you shouldn’t be attempting to undercut a rightfully elected Premier.

6597 2018-09-20 13:35:22 I'm confused! You keep bragging that the USA is now the largest producer of oil in the world.  So why are you concerned about prices in the Middle East?  Could it be you're bullshitting?  Maybe it's because as usual, you have absolutely no clue about what you're talking about!
6598 2018-09-20 13:35:15 Hope you found relief with the KASISADI oil.

The first step is to commit to VOTE DEMOCRAT and repudiate those who works for Big Oil and just want to burn everything that is underground (make a quick buck).

VOTE @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats and perhaps avoid having your house being destroyed every other year
6616 2018-09-20 13:34:12 Shit. I need to change my oil
6617 2018-09-20 13:34:05 I hate when they do this shit, on either side.  It's like, "Hey, this column is <insert name here>, let's find the most unappealing photo of said person, of which there are millions, and use that to make them look worse." It deflates any points being made IMO.
6618 2018-09-20 13:34:01 Or he might need his oil changed.

6682 2018-09-20 13:30:26 Why would he get into that? Alberta has high safety measures and workers make a good living or can if we can get the oil to market. That is what matters. Why, do you think we should buy oil from India now? Smh

6689 2018-09-20 13:30:04 I did my today salad with Vignette salt and oil, no Emiya but totally worth it ♡
6690 2018-09-20 13:29:59 I just read that an oil change for the cheapest Bugatti is about $25,000. 

Nothing else to say here, I just wanted you to know this.
6691 2018-09-20 13:29:50 How about weaning us OFF of oil? Then we could just import the barrels you need for Eric and Don Jr.’s hair.
6692 2018-09-20 13:29:46 Let's play a game. Deal or No Deal. Donald "No Deal" Trump has no concept of how economies work. Rising oil prices certainly help Russia and its one major export economy.  Trump's policies cause unrest in Middle-East raising oil prices. Coincidence?
6693 2018-09-20 13:29:42 Norway invested their oil revenue rather than just spending it like we have.  And if Farrage was so concerned about "catching our own fish" he could have turned up to a few EU fisheries meetings.
6694 2018-09-20 13:29:41 When I think about oil changes or anything car related, I wish I had a whole man to take care of that stuff for me cause i ain’t got time lol
6695 2018-09-20 13:29:34 天使に苦しむ
6696 2018-09-20 13:29:32 I meant.. Kratom is more for detoxing from opioids, I think?  I'm gonna work with this CBD oil thing.  Further investigation about to happen. 
6697 2018-09-20 13:29:19 maybe canola oil?
6698 2018-09-20 13:29:17 今日の心に染みる一曲
『 Beds are burning / Midnight Oil 』
down under らしい曲なしな(｡-_-｡)
懐かしやなしな(^^)
6699 2018-09-20 13:29:14 What if we didn't need oil so much anymore?
6700 2018-09-20 13:29:13 You are the dumbest person alive or dead. Thanks for inflation on goods and oil Ahole.
6701 2018-09-20 13:29:08 If your boyfriend doesnt know how to change your oil you have a girlfriend.
6702 2018-09-20 13:29:07 I've successfully made it 5 day without smoking bud, and I've started to have dreams again. 

Last night I dreamt I got free dab oil from the plug...this next month or two is gonna be swell 
6703 2018-09-20 13:29:05 Yes, we burn midnight oil then last day you extend. This has been going on every year. It better to be tax friendly and intimate in advance anout extension with a Stern warning, come what may no further extension.
6704 2018-09-20 13:28:56 Did you miss my tweet about Irving Oil preparing to build the required facilities in Saint John?

It wasn't exclusively an export pipeline.
6705 2018-09-20 13:28:55 He does America first, yet expects others to do his bidding. High Oil prices is good for OPEC nations, and it's their nation first. Besides he just imposed oil sanctions on one of the biggest oil producers Iran, yet expect oil prices to remain the same. I don't understand it?
6706 2018-09-20 13:28:49 You make it sound like we’re protecting them out of some virtuous sense of humanity. Plain and simple, we’re ensuring we have access to their oil.
6707 2018-09-20 13:28:41 Thank you  @starrmfranklin for supporting Zion Oil & Gas! $zn
6708 2018-09-20 13:28:33 Big noises mean nothing to the worlds oil market. It goes where it goes.
6709 2018-09-20 13:28:23 why not lemon juice and baking soda to trick your face into making more oil

6712 2018-09-20 13:28:05 why do chefs have to use so much oil and there cooking 
6713 2018-09-20 13:27:42 Can WE assume fast and furious, gunrunner, gunwalking in México were part of your protection for oil as well???
6714 2018-09-20 13:27:42 Coconut oil > lotion

6716 2018-09-20 13:27:34 Finding oil deep sea ? It's that all about ....??why do they sent it to the space and ran computer model on firm land with various levels of simulated gravity? What's de value of microgravity? Can they simulate microgravity in the same lab?
6717 2018-09-20 13:27:21 There are non-middle east countries in OPEC in South America and Western Africa. Their oil prices are a direct response to things like cheap natural gas from the US and Russia. Please get better advisers.

6720 2018-09-20 13:27:14 Trump seems confused that pulling out of the JCPAO has consequences like removing 1,000,000 barrels of oil from the market by sanctioning Iran. The Saudis literally cannot produce more as they are maxed out.
6721 2018-09-20 13:27:10 つかこんな酷い政治ばっかりやられてよく平気だなと呆れる、国の事や国民の事何も考えてないじゃん、
最近の政策なんて下手すると国民を見殺しにしてるレベルだって気付こうよ
もうやだよ、酷いことになると分かってる政策が次から次へと上がってるのにどうしようもできないの苦しい
6722 2018-09-20 13:27:07 Shouldn't we use the rest of the world's oil and save ours?...then we corner the market in the future

6729 2018-09-20 13:26:45 They have destroyed Libya, Iraq and Syria and don't want Iran to export oil and yet say that oil price is high !!!!!!!!!!
6730 2018-09-20 13:26:36 I’m drawn to art that’s the opposite of the kind I create. I’d love a large oil or acrylic with soft muted pastels like an abstract version of Monet water lilies. I have a giant wall aching for it but alas, there’s too much direct sunlight.
6731 2018-09-20 13:26:36 Successfully went and got an oil change and didn’t leave with a brand new car

6735 2018-09-20 13:26:18 I went to a naturopathic doctor in Hawaii&she called me yesterday bc she's doing a research paper on anxiety &depression. She's found that our brains are more likely to become depressed when we lack essential minerals. Eating higher fat foods &taking fish oil can actually help :)
6736 2018-09-20 13:26:18 Jimmy... what about the thousands of Oil industry families that have lost their jobs because of you and your government? Please have the decency to respond to my sincere question....

6738 2018-09-20 13:26:02 When OPEC raises prices, we pull from OUR OIL SUPPLY CHAIN!!! THAT'S How YOU FIGHT OPEC!!!! Can't believe you didn't know this was going to happen. Oh wait, yes I can. Your don't know how this works. You don't know how anything works.
6739 2018-09-20 13:25:50 ワイ死ぬんか？
6740 2018-09-20 13:25:50 The OPEC will always play games. Defund the @un and their agencies. They contribute to oil and gas subsides at US tax payer sacrifices when lobbying for money in LatAm and middle east. No more loans = NO SUBSIDIES = LOW OIL PRICES FOR ALL!

6743 2018-09-20 13:25:18 I did read the comments, she's sober too and uses only CBD oil for her anxiety. I can vouch there's no THC in CBD, I tried it but it made me too sleepy (thanks MECFS). That headline, oof

6746 2018-09-20 13:25:10 I’m a native. Born here. And I refuse to pay for the $340 million dollars to clean up their mess that they’ve been making. Colorado people will no longer support a Ponzi scheme. Seriously google oil and gas Ponzi scheme. It’s obscene how we’ve been duped. They are out of control.
6747 2018-09-20 13:25:06 Even Big Oil see's the need for Carbon pricing, the Cap & Trade market ON shared with California & Quebec was barely noticeable on the ground and popular with business. Natalia's party wants to end C&T (which will cost Ontario $4B for nothing but winding it down.)

6750 2018-09-20 13:24:58 But isn’t the oil sands in the Athabaskan water shed, which drains north?  Calgary’s water would not be affected by it.
6751 2018-09-20 13:24:55 Israel doesn’t really have oil though....

6755 2018-09-20 13:24:39 (+ 3/2) & not shifting problems. African Oil billionaires suppress their people & Macaroni needs Uran from Africa instead building Nuclear reactors that can burn Uran fully down. Energy politics is JOKE in Europe. Liberal green parties do nada green except being narcisstic & naiv
6756 2018-09-20 13:24:38 Obviously the Orange Shroom Bloom here doesn't get that US involvement in Middle Eastern affairs is partly to blame for its destabilization. Or that reducing our dependence on foreign oil through green technologies would bring oil prices down.

Stable genius, that one.
6757 2018-09-20 13:24:36 Hazelnuts are so disgusting that the only way to eat them is grind them into powder and cover them in chocolate and palm oil

6759 2018-09-20 13:24:33 The FDA is a branch that makes sure cures, medications, and treatments are tested and true so that you don't get tricked by a snake oil salesmen. If you want to stop anything from them go after devices.
6760 2018-09-20 13:24:31 You don’t even understand the basic economic principles of supply and demand. The only thing that can affect prices is lower demand by investing in greener technology. Demand for oil drops, prices at the pump follow.
6761 2018-09-20 13:24:29 As it turns out, OPEC can't do much about oil prices, because US sanctions on Iran create a void they can't fill @realDonaldTrump
6762 2018-09-20 13:24:17 As someone who bakes, I can conceive of using the word "wet" in terms of something other than water. (Like flour plus oil.) But not for hurricanes.
6763 2018-09-20 13:24:14 Big trippen, my ass not paying no 400 for a damn oil change

6767 2018-09-20 13:24:00 The bad news is that the war in #Yemen will take much more longer time than that predicted by some reckless people! Plead to #Trump to allow #OPEC to keep the #Oil price up for an indefinite time.
6768 2018-09-20 13:23:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.

6773 2018-09-20 13:23:38 Although held by some as a "charm" for keeping spiders out of the house, they genuinely do help for scientific reasons. The oil in the conker is a natural repellent. We use them at home in this way all the time #FolkloreThursday

でももう好きなことだったものが自分にとっては頑張ってやるものに分類されてて

そして何もしない
6776 2018-09-20 13:23:09 I completely forgot cars need oil changes oops
6777 2018-09-20 13:23:05 Thanks to you, they're not really safe WITH the US anymore. And seriously, do you think America would give two shits about any country in the region if it weren't for the oil? Stop trying to play so righteous.
6778 2018-09-20 13:23:04 It will replace it eventually, oil isn’t an inexhaustible product. Also the higher prices reflect the difficulties of extracting it.

6781 2018-09-20 13:22:56 Wow that's a dumb statement. Republicans lie and steal SCOTUS seats bc they are so backward thinking that they chase the illusion of control. They think they can control the world's money,oil, and women's bodies.
Lesser evolved thinking as the world moves away from them.
6782 2018-09-20 13:22:52 Alumni tp skrng bkn dlm industri tp education yg relate ngn oil n gas
6783 2018-09-20 13:22:50 Why the he'll are we funding people half way around the world with all those billionaire oil moguls in the mideast!!??!! Let them supply help in their part of the world.
6784 2018-09-20 13:22:42 "Oil is life and death, love and hate..." this was actually on the wall of the offices of a major, multinational and multifaceted oil company I once worked for. Of course, it was meant as satire (and taken from the back of the pulp novel, OIL). Zinke, though...
6785 2018-09-20 13:22:42 Who protects the countries of the middle east from us? Also who protects the countries in the middle east from our so called ally's in the middle east? As far as oil prices I guess the call you mentioned in a previous tweet didn't go as well as you said.
6786 2018-09-20 13:22:41 This is huge diplomatic win "if this is true".Would resolve all the headache & hurdles for the government.Many many congratulations to @narendramodi @PMOIndia @narendramodi_in @SushmaSwaraj @nitin_gadkari More than fall in oil prices..it reflects that nations interest comes first
6787 2018-09-20 13:22:40 Wasnt like the first time had shady people there for a long time before that making sure oil was flowing mistake was letting locals have too much power

6795 2018-09-20 13:21:45 말아.. 내 책상에서 뛰어다니지 마... 컵 떨어지고 난리 났네..
6796 2018-09-20 13:21:44 They said they will lower the prices if USA will allow them to sell oil not only in American Dollars but also in other currencies, do you agree? 
6797 2018-09-20 13:21:39 We should use our own oil and stop funding our enemies. Try protecting Europe, they are being invaded! That Syrian war Obama caused was done to create a refugee crisis as an excuse to flood Europe with incompatible people. It's an attack on civilization as we know it!
6798 2018-09-20 13:21:37 The price practiced on oil is absurd is totally out of the world financial reality.
6799 2018-09-20 13:21:36 Dati habol ko sa grabshare yung passenger, ngayon driver na. Hihihi  Usapang change oil at gasolina... bat ko ba alam yun. Nuna world?!

6805 2018-09-20 13:21:16 Would it work in Italian food? I ask because the Sicilian pasta with breadcrumbs that I do tastes predominantly of the olive oil used and the quality of the oil really makes a difference.

6809 2018-09-20 13:21:01 You do know that when sweat/oil and bacteria mix on your pubic hair it makes it smell right. Of course you don't cuz you've been hairy sweaty Betty for so long that funk smell is natural to you.
6810 2018-09-20 13:20:56 So government should work for all people EXCEPT those in the oil and gas industry???
6811 2018-09-20 13:20:50 I just hade my second treatment of paraffin oil and it feels so good after a treatment like that. Were you dip you hand in paraffin oil and wrap you hand in plastic and then putting it into a thick glove.
This is to help with the recovery of my hand.
6812 2018-09-20 13:20:45 Call me old fashioned, but a good book beside a lamp fired with whale oil, and a rudimentary understanding of science and medicine is my ideal Friday night.

6815 2018-09-20 13:20:39 The same guy is here every single time I drop my car off for an oil change and today I basically held his hand while giving him my keys. Usually I wouldn’t care, but I’m pretty sure he hates me so.

6823 2018-09-20 13:19:29 Maybe it’s time to lessen our dependency on oil all together. Focus on clean energy. Like we’ve been pushing for years now.
6824 2018-09-20 13:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
6825 2018-09-20 13:19:18 You know what?
We could have done this literally anytime in those 45 years.
Do you realize that everyone, EVERYONE, uses OUR technology for drilling oil?

6828 2018-09-20 13:19:08 Please don’t pretend that this country isn’t partially responsible for the environment. America needs to do its part, we can’t control what others do. The only “clean” energy is solar and air. When you strip land of coal and oil, it damages our ecosystem (earthquakes); end of.

6839 2018-09-20 13:17:56 OPEC is practicing capitalism. You should commend them for it. Why should they sell oil for less? Wouldn't you do the same to them? He who lives by the sword dies by the sword. If you don't like capitalism try being a socialist.

6846 2018-09-20 13:17:13 The U.S. now produces enough oil, solar, wind, and natural gas to be energy independent. Yet we are still buying from OPEC at their prices (see today’s Presidential tweet on this subject).  Why? Capitalism. U.S. oil companies make more money selling to other countries.

6914 2018-09-20 13:11:30 On oil sector it is worth recalling that security costs were largely cost recoverable, so Iraq paid for them (unlike every US soldier on the ground). Comparing cost of PSC to US mil in other areas would likewise prove cost-positive versus using mil. That's partly why it happened.

6916 2018-09-20 13:11:30 Please Mr. President, let us stop buying foreign oil and start using our own resources so the cost will come down on both oil and gas. The cost of living would then come down as well because the cost of shipping would drop considerably.

6960 2018-09-20 13:08:04 Have you tried cbd oil? My sister has anxiety but it has improved 100% since taking the oil.
6961 2018-09-20 13:08:00 "With higher oil prices #Russia is in a position to add 3% annually to the country’s production base, up from 1% annually previously, and this new level of growth looks like it can be sustained for at least the next few years" Ronald Smith, Senior Citi´s Russian Oil&Gas Analyst
6962 2018-09-20 13:07:57 I never got that myself. Exporting the resource should happen after we take our own supply and surely the people should benefit? Charge VAT, fair enough, but you’d think we didn’t have our own oil at all with these prices!

6967 2018-09-20 13:07:19 Alternatively, we could strive for oil independence by moving toward using renewable energy sources. That'd be cheaper anyway.
6968 2018-09-20 13:07:19 So you’re anti-Free Market? It sure sounds like you are for Government controlled prices for oil.

So how about controlling the prices for gas? It’s almost $3/gallon here (WAY higher than when Obama left).

6972 2018-09-20 13:07:00 Oil prices were down when Obama was in office. Way down. Maybe you should ask him for some pointers.
6973 2018-09-20 13:06:56 Actually, you do. You don't have enough medium & heavy crude oil for your refineries. Shale oil is too light for the refineries along the Gulf Coast, which also explains why US is still importing from Venezuela.

6990 2018-09-20 13:05:26 Coconut oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides, which are great for energy production and may even aid weight loss, and avocado oil is a great source of antioxidants like lutein, which supports eye function, along with types of fat that benefit the heart.
6991 2018-09-20 13:05:24 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
6992 2018-09-20 13:05:23 My tweets weren't designed to dispute your tweets' basic arguments, but new #crude #pipelines will eventually temper #trucking driver salaries, right? And the U.S. economy for the blue collar base hopefully is more complex than Permian #oil truck driver salaries. But maybe not?
6993 2018-09-20 13:05:19 2. They then are free to not share any market access to world markets with us. They export their oil at world  while importing our oil at a discount to fill domestic needs. It really is a sweet deal for the US and takes very little input from them to use our system against us.
6994 2018-09-20 13:05:19 You have to be able to at least check your oil level and check your tire pressure as a man. I feel like it’s a must
6995 2018-09-20 13:05:16 Use our oil and triple the price of our goods going to their countries.
6996 2018-09-20 13:05:10 Someone doesnt know U.S is the world #1 oil producer right now wuth 9million bpd
6997 2018-09-20 13:04:54 Well said but we don’t own the oil. Big Oil does, as price goes up more more money for them.
6998 2018-09-20 13:04:48 おっつありーです！
6999 2018-09-20 13:04:45 What about American oil companies? Production is up Alaska is open for drilling why are we still relying on OPEC for oil?
7000 2018-09-20 13:04:34 I agree, it wasn't in the beginning, when they shot down the Russian aircraft and  accepted the oil from the terrorists.  Now we'll just have to wait and see.

7012 2018-09-20 13:03:27 Trump has done everything he could to make oil prices high to help his friend Putin. Now all of a sudden, with the election so close, he tweets that OPEC should bring oil prices down.
7013 2018-09-20 13:03:22 We already have a mutually beneficial trade and peaceful cooperation with the EU. The snake oil that Brexititeers are selling suggests that the UK should have the same bargaining power outside the EU as it does inside.  We don't and we can't make demands as if we did.
7014 2018-09-20 13:03:19 Yeah what’s up with that??? Do they really think you’re a pushover? Haven’t they learned since they heard your speech on driving out the terrorists that you WILL NOT be messed with??? I say, TAKE THEIR OIL!!! 
7015 2018-09-20 13:03:19 The misogynist clerics do not have the last word. Iran will be free from the soft slippered tyrants, as Shahpour Bakhtiar called them. Then, Iran will no longer be exporting conflict oil. @jkenney @KerryDiotte @lamphieryeg

7022 2018-09-20 13:02:36 We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
7023 2018-09-20 13:02:35 Sir, it seems OPEC has not paid any heed to your last tweet of July’18 to lower the oil prices. On the other hand taking advantage of Iran’s embargo, OPEC has raised the prices by $10. Saudi is happy with $80 & above price whereas countries like India are suffering the most.
7024 2018-09-20 13:02:32 Its amusing how I can stay up for hours after work if I am at home, often struggling to sleep yet if I have a morning appointment I find myself fighting to stay awake.

This oil change has to be over soon.
7025 2018-09-20 13:02:31 Who, exactly, is a threat to ME oil producers? Iraq won't invade Kuwait again. Do you really think Iran is a threat? China has not rattled swords.  The only risk is nuclear-armed Israel. That's on you, @POTUS.

7068 2018-09-20 12:59:11 The best way to lower oil prices is to invest in the continued development of green energy and achieve total energy independence - free of oil and gas, the assets some tyrants use to buy weapons.
7069 2018-09-20 12:59:06 I know critical thinking is not your strong suit, but who the fuck do you think wants our protection? And did you miss the memo that we’re in OPEC? And that we produce more oil now than Saudi Arabia and Russia?

7083 2018-09-20 12:57:40 You know, if we transitioned off oil we wouldn't need to protect the countries in the Middle East. Imagine what we could do with all that money we didn't need to spend protecting our oil interests? Just saying.

7098 2018-09-20 12:56:35 I thought the Keystone pipeline was built to make the U.S. energy independent? Oh yeah, the pipeline was built to export oil and make oil companies rich. You lied and you suck!
7099 2018-09-20 12:56:21 Who wants to change my oil??
7100 2018-09-20 12:56:21 Thank you for responding, but your blog post is concerning. Since palm oil production is a major cause of deforestation and habitat loss, dismissing alternative veg oils due to "challenges around affordability, acceptability, and sustainability" is irresponsible at best ...
7101 2018-09-20 12:56:20 Fortunately we're producing more oil than we need so we're not feeling at the pumps. Also Iran doesn't have any trade substantial enough to tariff back at us or have enough friends to create a coalition. #lowhangingfruit
7102 2018-09-20 12:56:13 There are Nigerian kids who have a parent in the oil and gas sector that see their parent once or twice a year. They don’t say they’re dad or mum is a deadbeat, but wizkid doesn’t love the mother of his kid therefore haters have to conclude. It’s sad

7121 2018-09-20 12:54:05 Why Nigerians gotta put palm oil in everything??
7122 2018-09-20 12:54:01 Yes ofcourse that’s the only reason, not that Venezuela poorly managed their budget during the Oil boom. Which incidentally saw them become quite a wealthy nation.
7123 2018-09-20 12:53:57 Months pass by. I self-diagnose my obesity as ‘Double Morbid’ and note it on a spreadsheet which is stored in the Cloud (adding ‘scares children’ in the margin). My fingers, no longer extremities and slippy from oil, drop the touchscreen device. It smashes and goes on fire.

7140 2018-09-20 12:52:28 Yet every direct job created within the oil sands creates further employment - impacting hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs. It would be silly, and incredibly disingenuous, to try to imply that work at the oil sands only impacts people directly on site.
7141 2018-09-20 12:52:22 I like veggie burgers & veggie sausage patties. My favorite vegetarian meal is peppers, onions & mushrooms sautéed in olive oil over angel hair pasta with feta.

7150 2018-09-20 12:51:50 Are you serious? Obviously when we only protect them to steal their oil, they’re clearly gonna jack up the prices of their oil. I know your not intelligent, but come on lol that’s just common sense. As the shitty piece of shit business man you are you should get that
7151 2018-09-20 12:51:46 We the United States push for hire oil prices. Just ask any CEO of a major oil company in the United States. They have asked the OPEC countries to limit production so the price of oil will go up. Did no one tell you?

7189 2018-09-20 12:49:15 It is desperately sad. I don't know if retribution, although justified, would be of any benefit - if oil profits could be 100% diverted to strategies for dealing with the threat I would be more interested.

7233 2018-09-20 12:46:04 Those are technically fruit oils, not "veggie", so ok.  Same with avocado oil.
7234 2018-09-20 12:46:01 The USA is one of the leading exporters of oil in the world. You benefit more from high oil prices than anyone else.
7235 2018-09-20 12:46:00 CNBC: US oil futures rose to a more than two-month high on Wednesday, bolstered by a fifth weekly crude inventory drawdown & strong domestic gasoline demand, amid ongoing supply concerns over US sanctions on Iran that will come into force in November.

7237 2018-09-20 12:45:55 @realDonaldTrump thats an easy one Mr. President every time they raise the price of oil, you just increase domestic output & decrease middle eastern oil imports.  #KnowYourEnemy

7241 2018-09-20 12:45:49 So you protect the Middle East to make them safe, you want to keep  people in the Middle East from entering the country to keep the US safe. When it comes to the Middle East the only thing you truly want to protect is the last part of you tweet..The Oil
7242 2018-09-20 12:45:45 If Jesus Christ himself stood beside of Trump and his agenda; The media and the @dnc would still be against him. My point is that you can’t appease these liberals. They worship this world, soon their leader will destroy them. Remember he can’t harm the oil and wine.
7243 2018-09-20 12:45:44 Also, if you add olive oil, that's good for acne scars
7244 2018-09-20 12:45:40 Democrats are good at demanding stuff they know they can't have. I'm sure someone is burning the midnight oil on this fiasco.
7245 2018-09-20 12:45:39 Another @BP_plc scoop. Co. is in talks to sell some mature Egyptian oil fields to SDX Energy for ~$1b, bringing it closer to it's $5b-$6b divestment target. Story with @DNair5 on @TheTerminal #OOTT
7246 2018-09-20 12:45:38 Who cares. #EV's are rolling out, oil consumption will decline. But if @realDonaldTrump is really interested in a reliable supply of oil you should remove barriers for CO2-neutral #synfuel production using #nuclear energy.
7247 2018-09-20 12:45:36 mam  crude is about to break the upper resistance of 80 and ready to start its journey towards 86, ................. oil moving up is sign of strong global growth ............. even though oil will  cross 90 this year  but our nifty will touch 12000 this year
7248 2018-09-20 12:45:26 Baffles me why he wants oil prices reduce. His base is West Texas likes living large again.

NEW actions, NEW name!
7253 2018-09-20 12:45:12 You have correctly said.  The OPEC countries must end their monopoly first, on oil prices. Then only, we can come to their rescue.  They need latest armory and other weaponry, also. They need latest weaponry and we need your safety and lowered oil  prices.
7254 2018-09-20 12:45:08 USA has its own oil resources, use them!

7273 2018-09-20 12:43:14 This is threatening politics. The reason US went there to protect oilfields and show the super power.

7275 2018-09-20 12:43:06 Best thing I can possibly recommend though is researching full spectrum CBD oil though, for just about any issue.  I think we have vastly underestimated the importance of our endocannabinoid system and what happens when deficiencies occur.  It's changed my entire life for sure.
7276 2018-09-20 12:43:01 ぶっころすぞこの世界なあ
7277 2018-09-20 12:43:01 If we are the largest producer of oil, why are you trying to strong arm the Middle East? You know the best way to show we don’t need them? Invest in alternative energy here in the US, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Or is that too detrimental to your cronies?

7284 2018-09-20 12:42:27 @Sortalegendary1 FOXNews talked about the Permian basin today and did a story on Midland Texas... They say that that area is poised to boom because they can produce oil and make a profit at $50 a barrel. Sounds good for a REI!!??

7286 2018-09-20 12:41:57 You do realize that if prices go down you will affect oil exploration in America. We only do serious exploration when prices are high or it it’s not cost effective. Welcome to grown up decisions.

7288 2018-09-20 12:41:48 Yup. Just like the 70s crises. Separate prices for import and domestic oil. Worked out so smoothly.

7293 2018-09-20 12:41:37 The US produces the most oil of those in OPEC.  So why are our gas prices high?  Ask the oil companies.
7294 2018-09-20 12:41:36 The West care NOTHING for the crisis' economic dimension! Their primary goal was  REMOVING QADDAFI by whatever means ... and commandeering Libya's OIL.
7295 2018-09-20 12:41:30 Try using tea tree oil 
7296 2018-09-20 12:41:28 Wait. How exactly can OPEC be a monopoly when the largest oil producer in the world is.... the US? #THANKYOUPRESIDENTOBAMA
7297 2018-09-20 12:41:15 Working for only the US so far because the Saudis have temporarily increased oil supply.  Those countries dependent on Iranian oil suffer and get pissed off.

7315 2018-09-20 12:39:56 We thought Saudis are your friends and would have increased production with your order and demand! You sound frustrated. But the reality is America protects nobody with the exception of its own interests in OIL & ISREAL.

That is entirely different than 'weed.'
7326 2018-09-20 12:38:53 It's funny you say this when oil prices being high are because of the new turmoil you've caused in the region.  How about solving the issue by reducing demand for a change?  You know the thing that was happening before your disastrous presidency started?

7329 2018-09-20 12:38:41 Yeah, that's a good idea - threaten the countries where we get most of our oil from. That's totally going to make them want to lower the price we pay. Maybe they should slap some sanctions on it...that always works for diplomacy, right?
7330 2018-09-20 12:38:40 お疲れ様ー！
7331 2018-09-20 12:38:36 Over population is a state whereby a nation has more people than resources..what are you even saying? We produce crude oil and other agricultural products and invest in our economy rather than rearing poisonous snakes and running around like vagabonds without destination...
7332 2018-09-20 12:38:34 Maybe Acid Man matches Oil Man.

7338 2018-09-20 12:37:48 That means instead of killing people to steal their oil you'll be killing some fish instead
7339 2018-09-20 12:37:42 look at it this way, it is rather challenging to incorporate truffle oil into air-based dishes, as such you will no longer have the need to buy truffle oil. i think i just changed your life to be honest.
7340 2018-09-20 12:37:36 Trump you have created a crisis with Iran. Trump, Iran was prepared to pump more oil in the market, which would have reduced costs,  but YOU TRUMP, had to back out of the IRAN DEAL, and placed sanctions. This is all on you Trump,  again you displayed you are inept in deal making.

7356 2018-09-20 12:36:31 How you figure prices will get Low? @BarackObama subsidized oil drilling in the US and kept the oil in the US that way American prices remained low and it forced OPEC to lower their prices because America wasn’t buying from them. You need to listen to him jackass
7357 2018-09-20 12:36:25 Then why is Trump complaining about higher oil (gasoline!) prices, Mr Economist?

7364 2018-09-20 12:36:15 Don't worry, as we invest in solar and wind, we will break the oil monopolies and the oil companies.  There will be demand for a long time, but much less so.  That is one of two reasons why China has invested so heavily in those technologies.  The other is pollution.
7365 2018-09-20 12:36:06 OPEC TO TRUMP: "JUST GO BACK TO GOLFING AND LEAVE THIS TO ADULTS". Senior officials for OPEC, chuckling at President Trump's threats of decreasing military support unless oil prices drop, said "Trump's so stupid, he doesn't even know the US is the world's top oil producer".

7371 2018-09-20 12:35:53 Why do you think Obama was trying to steer us away from oil dependence. Idiot, we should be leading on renewable energy like solar and wind so we can control the market on that and not have to depend on these countries.
7372 2018-09-20 12:35:44 honestly someone needs to take my car to get an oil change, detailed....all that.
7373 2018-09-20 12:35:38 Put a 25% tariff on Middle East oil. That will cut demand and price

7388 2018-09-20 12:34:37 To get the amount of plants to feed and clothe a vegan world would require increasing crop land and crop yields. This would require additional farm acreage meaning more loss of wild habitat. This would also require more the use of more farm machinery increasing oil use.

7396 2018-09-20 12:33:57 The most ridiculous thing about this statement is that higher prices are good for the American energy sector. It's more expensive for us to get oil so when the prices are high it becomes profitable to do so. Demanding OPEC to lower prices is killing American jobs!
7397 2018-09-20 12:33:50 Tire rotation and oil changes. Hmu if yall need that. Any car. Don't matter.

7399 2018-09-20 12:33:20 Trump you have nothing to do with OPEC, you cannot dictate to them. Remember you tweeted to your base you asked the Prince to do something about oil prices, well another Trump lie, nothing has changed. Stop with the lieing.

7400 2018-09-20 12:33:14 We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
7401 2018-09-20 12:33:13 FYI, there are 45 days left until November 4th. That's about how long it takes for Middle Eastern oil to reach the US Gulf Coast. Now where are those "2,000,000 barrels" Trump called the Saudi king for? #OOTT
7402 2018-09-20 12:33:08 #CBC spinning to keep oil by rail instead of by pipeline like rest of world.
7403 2018-09-20 12:33:07 Hey Fat Don. You put sanctions on Iran so here is a simple equation for you to understand. Less oil = higher prices. Gabbish
7404 2018-09-20 12:33:05 Supply and demand controls price of oil.
7405 2018-09-20 12:33:02 I can. I just need you to cop the oil and a filter from advanced auto parts. I could rotate ya tires too.
7406 2018-09-20 12:32:58 Go die!
7407 2018-09-20 12:32:57 I'm glad at least one person had an honest experience. I went for an oil change last week & it was a 20 min sales pitch. After he said "looks like you need an air filter" I laughed and said "you put a new one in a month ago". Same location. On dashcam. Never again.
7408 2018-09-20 12:32:56 What about all of the jobs created in  Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming  etc. Because crude oil is up above $50/barrel. If a few coal miners and steel mill workers are worth a trade war what about us?

7410 2018-09-20 12:32:53 Mash everything in a mixer along with extra tomatoes. Put oil in a pan. Cook this mix as we do for curry. Add boiled potato/paneer/veggie of your choice. Cook for 5 more minutes. it will be good for sure. If you have chicken/mutton masala at home add it for amazing taste.
7411 2018-09-20 12:32:52 Record profits by oil companies and Reliance. Also, Govt trying to shift the blame on increasing international crude oil prices whereas actual reasons are 12 times increase in excise duty! Stop fooling people.

7426 2018-09-20 12:31:56 If you haven’t realized, the United States doesn’t produce nearly enough oil for their demand. They must import. Also, a large portion of their refineries are tooled to process heavy crude (not the light stuff coming out of the Permian).
7427 2018-09-20 12:31:54 You want to keep us dependent on oil and coal. We need more modern, renewable energy and more efficient vehicles. You’re living in the past, about 30 years in the past according to your staff.

7432 2018-09-20 12:31:32 Well donald maybe you should declasify alternative energy device.that would force them to stop increasing oil prices
7433 2018-09-20 12:31:29 Also, how is OPEC calling the shots on prices when USA is the largest producers of oil at the moment.
7434 2018-09-20 12:31:26 But IDIOT Trump supporters still believe he is great deal maker, MEXICO laughed in his face, NK got military exercises cancelled immediately and gave Trump nothing, Israel got him to leave Iran deal with fake photos, now oil prices soaring, 2 trillion budget signed Ño wall funded

7472 2018-09-20 12:28:41 So you protect them just because of the oil?

Them: “nah the government wouldn’t lie bruv.”

7479 2018-09-20 12:28:11 Iran’s production can easily be replaced by OPEC. But if OPEC choose to cut production then it will escalate the oil price. I believe Trump will not let OPEC to control the price anymore. High oil price is not good for the global economy after all.

7505 2018-09-20 12:25:55 I like my lamb darker and that comes from high heat and butter/oil so nah I wouldn’t order lamb to cook it this way
7506 2018-09-20 12:25:52 I await to see @muvangoni voting in favor of the electorate @MachakosCtyNews @DrAlfredMutua . What i mean is 0% of Oil.
7507 2018-09-20 12:25:50 IMO...you are seeing Trump right now in real time lay the ground work for "I must protect the American people from high oil prices caused by the US having to shut in Iran and Venezuela breaking down by releasing a big blast of US SPR #oil" Right in front of Nov elections #OOTT
7508 2018-09-20 12:25:46 @RachelNotley when will the Canadian Government understand that we need the ability to refine our own oil & gas products, and end the reliance on foreign oil? We should be exporting not importing! #cdnpoli Albertas can build it, run it and invest in our future again

7510 2018-09-20 12:25:44 You're kidding, right? Why would OPEC lower the price of oil? Why would any country or leader make an agreement with you about anything? They all know your time is limited. Remember Helsinki!
7511 2018-09-20 12:25:42 We don't need middle eastern oil but you're aware your supporters believe whatever you say.
7512 2018-09-20 12:25:40 Their dipstick doesn't quite reach the oil.......

I don't know what's going on with that one. Sounds like high school again.
7513 2018-09-20 12:25:35 We dont want to rely on oil anymore and its YOUR FAULT that we're behind in alternative energy.
7514 2018-09-20 12:25:34 Interesting rant, considering the administration's policies to inhibit the shift to renewable energy, which are now cheaper than fossil fuels and make the notion of oil cartels completely irrelevant.  A shift away from fossil fuels would also weaken Putin's petro-state economy.
7515 2018-09-20 12:25:32 Yep, because they have oil.  If they were growing turnips, we wouldn't be there, DS
7516 2018-09-20 12:25:28 That's what happens when you mix the oil.

7519 2018-09-20 12:24:38 Yawn. The soaring oil price predicted by the YesNP to pay for all that really worked out well didn't it. We would be bankrupt. Brexit looks well thought through in comparison.
7520 2018-09-20 12:24:30 President Trump criticized OPEC this morning, saying the "OPEC monopoly must get [oil] prices down now!"
7521 2018-09-20 12:24:20 so low oil prices are good for american oil producers how ?

You’re probably looking in the $45-50 range.
“I have a coupon that says $39.95.”
Well then that would be the price.
“I have two coupons.”
I only need one, ma’am.
7529 2018-09-20 12:23:28 he is saying that for months and no one give a ****

there is a deal between us and him, if he want a lower oil price, he know exactly what he should do

7541 2018-09-20 12:22:20 You can try the CBD items (comes in oil and edibles) that treat symptoms without the psychoactive effect. My 20 yr. old daughter got some for pain from a pinched nerve and it helped. Good luck and sorry to hear about your condition.

7560 2018-09-20 12:20:13 So you're celebrating the supporters of carbon capture and storage for enhanced oil recovery? This will see the continuation of mountain top removal and the use of vast amounts of water in depleted oil fields. It will also deliver oil spills, coal dust, and poisoned aquifers.
7561 2018-09-20 12:20:09 it’s not a mask but try adding lavender to your toner and instead of a cream moisturizer i use an oil. sounds scary bc acne but i just use straight rosehip oil!

7565 2018-09-20 12:20:01 This is an ultimate #Fact , throughout history their only power has been their oil, NOTHING ELSE, but oppression and Sharia law lives in the pathetic Middle East. They try to control America and other 1st world countries with oil. NO MORE, cuz #MAGA is here sheeps.
7566 2018-09-20 12:19:52 Hehe, shameful moment it was. Btw I used freshly made schmaltz this time instead of oil or tallow. Lovely delicate flavor on the sear.
7567 2018-09-20 12:19:34 Capitalism does not corrupt politicians unless politicians want to be corrupted.  Not all politicians want to be corrupted.

USA politicians broke up Standard Oil and AT&T, plus came to an agreement with IBM and prosecuted Microsoft, requiring them to keep Apple afloat.
7568 2018-09-20 12:19:32 WTF are you talking about? The US are up there at the top for paying less for Gas and Oil! You have no clue about world economics and probably in general giving the amount of times you have filed for Bankruptcy .

7582 2018-09-20 12:18:21 Totally ridiculous statement. The US and its government and Central Bank are running Trillion dollar deficits, are monetizing those deficts w newly printed dollars, yet they want the worlds oil suppliers to continue to sell a barrel of oil at same price.

7584 2018-09-20 12:18:18 Thought we were fighting for freedom and not oil prices. Guess it’s freedom to lower prices.

7586 2018-09-20 12:18:04 U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell for a 5th straight week to 3.5 yr lows, while gasoline inventories also drew down sharply last week on unseasonally strong demand.

7602 2018-09-20 12:17:11 No, it was because YOU dropped the Iran deal which was lowering the price because of the amount of oil they were supplying to the market, now we don't have access to that oil and they are still getting rid of nuclear weapon capability.

7614 2018-09-20 12:15:49 1. Oil revenue is not the only source of money. 
2. Revenue is accumulative. Eventually all citizens will be catered to, but they need to start from somewhere.
3. The government need to delegate money effectively. 
Progress can be made with time, but currently there’s no intent.

And of course it's the wettest, from the standpoint of oil.
7633 2018-09-20 12:14:34 The United States is one of the largest crude oil producers. U.S. refineries obtain crude oil produced in the United States and in other countries. U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). Oil is high because of U.S
7634 2018-09-20 12:14:34 That's remarkable! It's a beautiful piece of art and I hope it's alright that I'm using it; I'll gladly add a link to your Twitter profile or elsewhere ... Read a fascinating NYT story over the summer about Guyana and this recent oil drilling...

7637 2018-09-20 12:13:59 So what you’re saying is that you will withdraw said “protection” if oil prices increase? Is that not the same as any local gang boss who offers ‘protection’ in lieu of payment? Shocking, truly shocking.
7638 2018-09-20 12:13:58 Just trade some oil and buy a Ferrari !!!
7639 2018-09-20 12:13:53 Without our technology introduced years ago to extract the oil they would have never gained such wealth...!

7641 2018-09-20 12:13:49 Turns out it was a waste oil leak at the Suburu garage across the road. Good chance to let out some secret farts though!
7642 2018-09-20 12:13:38 Yeah, it would be much better if the region fell into complete chaos or under the domination of an enemy.  That would defineitly lower the cost of oil.

7648 2018-09-20 12:13:05 Now oil is traded in US dollars. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to switch it too #bitcoin-based trading? 
And yes, I have a selfish reason for that too.
7649 2018-09-20 12:13:03 I start my morning at 4:30 am. Brush my teeth. Brew hot water, do sun salutations and meditate til that pot whistle. Mix my concoction (lemon,acv,oregano oil,black seed oil,tumeric,manuka honey,and cayenne). Call my uber 5:15 and I’m out.

7653 2018-09-20 12:12:39 Price are controlled by your rich friends. Oil companies are the one with tax breaks and charging us more too.

7666 2018-09-20 12:11:24 You moron, OPEC dumped tons of crude back in 2009-2015. That cause crude prices to drop worldwide and it was great for the global economy.
It almost wrecked the US oil industry..
Exxon Mobile cannot make enough profit if crude is below $60/barrel.
Take an economics class!
7667 2018-09-20 12:11:23 Fires can happen check your stove and dryer. Clean off oil and grease from the stove and oven and the stove please and remove any nearby plastics from the top of the stove range and any burnables from the oven.

7673 2018-09-20 12:11:10 On 6/30/2018 you tweeted that you had talked to King Salman and that he had agreed to increase oil production by 2 million barrels to lower prices. That , as I pointed out, was a lie. Thank you for the confirmation.

Are you still Jaitley or Jait lie....
7677 2018-09-20 12:11:03 And if OPEC pushes the prices up, the oil companies here will raise prices too.  That’s the way it works.
7678 2018-09-20 12:11:00 Oil & gas companies saying they will have to use more dangerous, non-trade secret chemicals for fracking if they have to tell landowners what chems they're using is very "why-are-you-hitting-yourself?" bully behavior. Amazing deflection, they obvs think we're all daft.
7679 2018-09-20 12:10:44 This guy creates a crisis and blames opec, the second largest producer of oil is IRAN and now he has sanctioned it and then he cries like

7687 2018-09-20 12:10:13 Mr. President ask the oil companies in the United States to reduce their oil prices as you are not importing oil or very little of it.
7688 2018-09-20 12:10:13 From a man of profound stupidity who is ignorant of physics and geology. We're going to get the low prices, but with much lower consumption due to decreasing net energy from non-conventional oil.

7694 2018-09-20 12:09:50 Later @Ryanair tells shareholders their costs are going up and faces challenges from oil prices and #Brexit- our reporter @EmmaMMcNamara was there and brings us the latest....
7695 2018-09-20 12:09:42 Avec Total? que fait un grand pétrolier dans l'affaire? la fin du pétrole est pour bientôt, le pic oil du pétrole conventionnel à eu lieu en 2005, maintenant on va nous faire du #plastique de canne à sucre qui ne se recyclera pas naturellement et va consommer des ressources.
7696 2018-09-20 12:09:42 It's called the big oil spill of 2010.   There might be no turning back since the government let BP leave all that oil and chemicals at the bottome of the GULF.
7697 2018-09-20 12:09:37 Please do something about oil prices. They affect everyone.
7698 2018-09-20 12:09:37 This tweet is a prime example of attacking a perceived problem with an incorrect solution. We need to invest in clean energy solution (not coal) & eliminate foreign oil production.this does not mean fit yiyvto push for more domestic oil. RESIGN 
7699 2018-09-20 12:09:35 Funny story...

My male coworker said he had to have his ENTIRE FUCKING engine replaced because he didn’t get an oil change. Like ever. He “didn’t know” he needed to get those done.
7700 2018-09-20 12:09:35 And why do you protect those oil rich states? Why do those oil rich states exist? Frack you buddy!
7701 2018-09-20 12:09:30 From what I'm seeing, the media is not saying anything about the driver/passengers of the Model X. I had to come to this thread to find out if the driver/passengers were okay. @businessinsider Your pro-big oil bias is showing!
7702 2018-09-20 12:09:29 Or, one might go back to the Saudi oil deal and how F.D. Roosevelt wooed Abd al-Aziz Ibn Saud away from Churchill.

7704 2018-09-20 12:08:55 So the question still stands: where's all the money from the #NorthSea oil and gas gone? British media talks a lot about oil rich countries misusing their oil and gas wealth. So why not look closer to home and tell us how so much money had gone missing. #justsaying

7713 2018-09-20 12:08:10 We aren’t protecting a lot of the Middle East countries!! We seem to do more for saudi yet they are the worst with re to human rights and we are letting Assad and Russia kill thousands. Maybe we should try to ease off the oil?
7714 2018-09-20 12:08:06 He is saying this to sell their oil to the world before world move to an alternate source of fuel.

Yes it is good for us(India)

7723 2018-09-20 12:07:28 Why protect Saudi Arabia?
"There is also significant evidence OPEC  lost its internal cohesion, with Saudi Arabia trying to dump too much oil to hurt more expensive US/Canada Shale Oil production, so far with little success"
7724 2018-09-20 12:07:27 It's not America first its Israel and Saudi Arabia first as we send billions to Israel to be our friends and billions to Saudi Arabia for oil....how is that America first or th billions that we send African nations to send  their students to college? It was in the last budget
7725 2018-09-20 12:07:20 Also, the best way to punish Russia is with lower oil prices.  Let’s work to drive that economy into the ground.

7787 2018-09-20 12:02:14 Oil can also destroy the seals and gaskets if it sits too long. If you have a paper oil filter instead of a canister. It can eat the paper and then the paper will flow through your engine causing more damage.

7789 2018-09-20 12:02:06 I started using CBD oil this week to help with my crazy shoulder pain and arthritis I have in it from my reconstructive surgery I had years back. And let me tell you, I’ve never felt better, strongly suggest people to give it a try that have any type of chronic pain or anxiety
7790 2018-09-20 12:02:02 We export more oil than we import.  Talk to your big oil buddies.  The ones still subsidized by the U S .

7794 2018-09-20 12:01:40 Hey Trump, just because the JMMC meeting is taking place there, #Algeria has no control over the oil prices. Just saying, in case your finger slips on that red button
7795 2018-09-20 12:01:34 I mean Trump's current tweet in particular has a butt load if you just type in the right Buzz words like oil

rising oil prices fuel cleaner environment & physical health!
Just hope....some idiot from the ruling dispensation doesn't steal the 'silver lining' & crown the govt. With it!
7798 2018-09-20 12:01:06 Isn't the US oil companies that are pushing prices higher by forcing Saudi Arabia to export less oil. Dumbass Trump!! He always like to blame the people that do not look like him!!

7812 2018-09-20 12:00:13 Seriously? Do you really think oil prices are set based on appreciation of the US, rather than -- say -- global demand? And you realize that if prices drop, EVERYONE pays less -- including countries you don't like?
7813 2018-09-20 12:00:12 Just put tariffs on the oil.......

7819 2018-09-20 11:59:54 Supply and demand might have something to do with oil prices, but since you don’t understand how tariffs impact economics, why should you understand oil?

My bad, forgot how low IQ you are.

7824 2018-09-20 11:59:31 What should have happened is you shouldn't have been running stupid gas guzzlers thinking oil would never run out. All through the 60's 70's 80's and 90's running cars with ridiculously large engines because of an obsession with POWER! Four decades of waste.
7825 2018-09-20 11:59:31 I'm happy to announce within 2 years my oil refinery has become the largest in its area, and that I will be sticking to this buisness.
7826 2018-09-20 11:59:19 "Ankara has for months called for a targeted campaign against the jihadists"
If that is true then why did Ankara fail to stop supplying weapons and ammunition to the same jihadists and why did it fail to stop buying oil from the same?

Was Ankara all talk and no action?
7827 2018-09-20 11:59:11 Fracking and your pipeline don’t make money unless oil prices are high. The overhead is too much. Stop blaming everyone else for your doing.
7828 2018-09-20 11:59:09 Ignoring the 'sensible management' comment, Mr Dean has a point - the GW electrification seems hugely over-engineered. I passed through Reading on son's narrowboat last w/end and 'oil rig' did spring to mind. Come nuclear armageddon, the cockroaches won't be the sole survivors
7829 2018-09-20 11:59:09 Great we get a whole 4 cents while you still give a subsidy of 7 cents per kilowatt to nuclear and how much of our tax dollars are supporting oil and gas, we want infrastructure and mental health funding and an increase to min wage

7831 2018-09-20 11:58:47 I thought it was the Presidents fault when oil prices were high, or is that only when we have a Dem President?
7832 2018-09-20 11:58:40 Trump insists on pumping more oil from Middle East because his inflation and intetest rate expectations depends on low oil priced.
7833 2018-09-20 11:58:39 We buy more oil from them, then they buy from us. By your misguided logic, we should enact a tarrif on their goods.

7839 2018-09-20 11:58:19 You are driving up oil prices. You put sanctions back on Iran strictly to do just that.

7842 2018-09-20 11:58:10 I pray for Allah to make the oil prices +100$.
Since the oil prices plunged to 20$ a barrel we had direct impact economically because of it.

+100$ makes us breath again.
7843 2018-09-20 11:57:59 Get off the oil teat and do something for the environment instead of threatening other countries. Oh that's right you love pollution I almost forgot.

7861 2018-09-20 11:56:15 Also, I know It’s semantics but OPEC is not a Monopoly, it’s a Cartel. Monopoly implies they control ALL the oil, they don’t. Cartel implies different groups are working together to control a market.
7862 2018-09-20 11:56:12 No it isn't. We consume on average 19.69 million barrels/day. We only produce 11m/day. The production of oil is up 10% under the Trump administration and increased 100% under the obama administration. Facts matter and you don't have any.

7865 2018-09-20 11:56:08 He doesnt seem to understand the only meaningful investment over the past decade has been in Texas, which would be crushed by his desires for low oil prices. Trump is setting us up for a major and harsh rally the longer he "contains prices."
7866 2018-09-20 11:56:07 I can’t figure out why I’m being called a robber baron. Do any of you guys know?
7867 2018-09-20 11:55:59 Russia although not in OPEC is still brainwashing these Middle East jokers. Trump got that and brings out his stick whenever oil prices scale a new peak.
7868 2018-09-20 11:55:44 We truly are capable of overtaking them, that must be hard to accept. Also no matter what they win there never really accepted and the achievements are won by oil money

7872 2018-09-20 11:55:29 The lower prices lasted ONE DAY - time would  be better spent putting controls in place for the zany daily ups and downs of gas prices at the whim of the massively profitable oil Companies
7873 2018-09-20 11:55:27 Consider this: a bottle of mineral water for sale in the supermarket or served in a restaurant costs more than the equivalent volume of crude or distillate products. Yet, which business - water or oil - takes more capex to produce?
7874 2018-09-20 11:55:26 The US sells them bullets, bombs, fighter planes, etc. in the billions and they sell the US billions in black gold, oil, texas tea, saudi sludge, fossil fuel, etc. The US does all it can to destabilize the entire world so it can sell more defense/offense goodies world-wide
7875 2018-09-20 11:55:22 That’s why Obama pushed alternative energies like wind and solar, so we would be less dependent upon foreign oil. You are stuck in the past pushing antiquated sources like coal. You’re not qualified to be POTUS. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
7876 2018-09-20 11:55:21 Oil lasts for 15000 miles. Not the 3k they say. Another SCAM folks....oil change lights. Press and hold the button and reset the light and wait it out. Unless your car belches blue smoke.

7880 2018-09-20 11:54:58 No conspiracy. It's how US oil works. Campaign finance is private and dark money (SuperPACs) finances candidates.

Who provides financing to whom, how it's provided, and the conditions under which it's provided matters a lot. Private campaign donors hold a large seat.

7912 2018-09-20 11:52:11 We need to appreciate our oil from a different lens. Our oil revenues should be used to invest in the infrastructure, education and industries required to create a modern, competitive and free-market economy
7913 2018-09-20 11:52:00 oil priced in dollar was a very clever move by the US, it made the dollar strong and as a result the dollar became a store of value. This is why in a crisis people buy the dollar

7921 2018-09-20 11:51:25 Hi hope you are well. I run a successful business called Golden Oil Stretch Marks massage therapy, this treatment defies science. I would love to to be given the opportunity to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
7922 2018-09-20 11:51:25 They push higher oil prices because you decided to make clean and renewable energy difficult and are pushing us back to oil dependency, thus raising demand for their supply. Its the law of supply and demand, one even YOU can't break.  Its economics 101, brainwave.
7923 2018-09-20 11:51:15 Notice how they "protect" Arab states?? They take out Arab dictators but call other dictators "good guys" (the ones that have no oil.) There is no difference between Sadam Hoosain and Kim Jung Un, one was taken out the other is a good guy!

7925 2018-09-20 11:50:47 They don't need our protection they ”need” our resources and weapons to kill innocent people, aka civilians. Please stop pretending we need fossil fuels for energy as well. Nobody needs oil for energy anymore. You work for the banks and the criminal oligarchy.

7927 2018-09-20 11:50:37 #Trump: We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!

7938 2018-09-20 11:49:49 This is a bullshit argument. Trump's OPEC plan is higher prices, not lower. Higher prices open up more domestic oil production and gives higher profits to Trump's corporate "big oil" lobbying buddies. Why do you think he has such a love for domestic off shore drilling?

7945 2018-09-20 11:49:20 We produce more oil than we can use. We use oil from the Middle East because it is cheaper. We “monitor” the security of the Middle East to protect out cheap oil. This invalidates every single thing you just said.

I still oppose support to Saudi Arabia re treatment of women & support of mullahs.
8012 2018-09-20 11:42:37 US is not protecting any country in the Middle East except Israel. It is really supporting a handful of dictators and exploiting the oil resources of the region.

Most OPEC countries are from Africa. 
The OPEC is no monopoly as it controls only 40% of the oil market.

8058 2018-09-20 11:39:32 Is this through stealing oil from other countries?
8059 2018-09-20 11:39:31 Maybe also, why such people get elected in the first place? Just like oil can’t be dissolved in water - the followers of Religion of Peace can’t assimilate in the land of Kaffirs - #Beware #IslamKills
8060 2018-09-20 11:39:26 lol. RT @FvckScooby: idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but....

get an oil change
8061 2018-09-20 11:39:14 Your sanctions on Iran removed a large percentage of the worlds oil supply from the market. It's called "the laws of supply anddemand" and prices go up accordingly. But you're way too ignorant to know anything about economics. Your 6 bankruptcies prove that.
8062 2018-09-20 11:39:13 Or, you know, leave the Middle East alone? This way we will save so much military expenses it will be enough to take us off the needle of foreign oil
8063 2018-09-20 11:39:03  Those onions and carrots were cooked to al dente,.. Plus the potatoes that you can't see were  poached in olive oil.. 
8064 2018-09-20 11:39:00 Low oil prices would hurt the Russian economy bigly. Must not have cleared this tweet with Putin.
8065 2018-09-20 11:38:59 The same morons that that don’t want wind, solar, or geothermal energy but bitch about oil prices are the same morons that think voting for a millionaire businessman tv personality is voting anti-establishment. #maga

8067 2018-09-20 11:38:54 Your sanctions on Turkey is to destabilize the countries buying oil from it... Russia, China, India are your targets and terrorism is a mask.... you're hitting poor people mr. Trump not some wealthy crazy Asians....

8070 2018-09-20 11:38:38 oil isn’t unlimited, it’s not Diet Coke. It’s only going to get more expensive. That’s why countries are spending money on alternatives.
8071 2018-09-20 11:38:36 All this shows is their models for runaway temperature increases were more wildly wrong than those used by all the other models that have been wildly wrong. Their C degrees increases are way off from actual T. Even oil companies can screw up.
8072 2018-09-20 11:38:22 That told them...Did you challenge SNP leadership about the forthcoming second oil boom?
8073 2018-09-20 11:38:10 Trump knows nothing about history. ALL of the problems in the Middle East are the result of the western power's desire to control the regions oil.
8074 2018-09-20 11:38:05 Pump another (at least) 8 million barrels of oil a day if you can, or 6.2 if you stop exporting.
8075 2018-09-20 11:38:05 Hey fool. Did you know that Canada is the biggest supplier of crude to the USA? Canada has an extensive network of 840,000 kilometres of pipelines carrying crude oil.The current crude oil pipeline capacity exiting Western Canada is estimated at 3.9 million barrels per day.
8076 2018-09-20 11:38:01 เพื่อนก็ยังเป็นเพื่อน ไม่ได้คุย ไม่ได้เจอนานแค่ไหน พอกลับมาคุยกัน ก็ยังเหมือนเดิม
8077 2018-09-20 11:37:52 Oil and the combustion engine are outdated and need to be phased out. Alternative energy sources are available its time to use them. The USA needs to take a global leadership role in alternative energy sources.

8085 2018-09-20 11:36:54 Trump will try to use any leverage he has on Saudi's to make them raise the production but Saudi's are already near their maximum capacity so a waiver on iran oil would help more in bringing down the prices
8086 2018-09-20 11:36:18 Well how about we start seriously moving away from oil... Just a thought. Every had a good one?
8087 2018-09-20 11:36:14 While supply and demand affect oil prices, it is actually oil futures that set the price of oil.

8089 2018-09-20 11:36:09 But despite this there is a monopolistic nature of the OPEC which is detrimental to the global trade. The OPEC must exercise their  power to decrease the oil price.

8092 2018-09-20 11:35:54 Where is the 'public discourse' when there is no answer to some the basic questions on oil price rise? How come the constant hike in oil price was a crime in Congress UPA govt, and now it's okay in BJP-led NDA rule?

8136 2018-09-20 11:32:00 Yeah sure tank the price of oil and put US oil producers out of business that will work out well for us.
8137 2018-09-20 11:32:00 It's a deal!
8138 2018-09-20 11:31:53 Oh geez...I had completely forgotten "take their oil."
8139 2018-09-20 11:31:53 Sounds like extortion instead of free markets.  Let oil prices rise so the market can respond with green alternatives and I'm not talking about "clean" coal
8140 2018-09-20 11:31:51 WE have broken the backs of the so called OPEC monopoly years ago...Isn't America the largest producer of oil for our consumption? When you piss off people, That's what happens..
8141 2018-09-20 11:31:51 ...global oil price has been deregulated and having the fluctuation due to convertibility rate, devaluation, export import situation mainly  current account situation and the basis of foreign direct investments(FDIs) and foreign institutional investment(FIIs) of countries...

8152 2018-09-20 11:31:29 I agree, but we have our own oil, too!! There’s no reason to believe that oil won’t be obsolete by the time we make a dent in our own oil. Drill, baby, drill, and bring that price down to $1/gal!!
8153 2018-09-20 11:31:24 The oil revenue figure is also explained—it is referring to oil which doesn't come into the UK for further processing, but is transported directly elsewhere. So it doesn't create a 'black hole' as you might hope.
8154 2018-09-20 11:31:24 You're worried about oil & protecting other countries... You should be worried about about protecting US citizens against white boys with AR-15's or even protecting Flint residents from their toxic killer water!!!

8163 2018-09-20 11:30:41 Opec doesn't have a monopoly.... Monopoly means they are the only providers, but the US, Norway, UK, Russia, Venezuela and others also produce oil outside of Opec, while they can influence it because they group together, prices are set by the market. Your Iran BS made it worse!
8164 2018-09-20 11:30:40 Stop pretending that oil countries r not puppets of the USA. They take that money and put it in USA banks and buy USA military. We choose who rules the mideast.

8193 2018-09-20 11:29:05 Who the fuck cares? The U.S. is the largest producer of oil in the world. If we stopped refining here just to ship it overseas, we wouldn't have an issue. Remember - the way fracking was sold. Oil independence? No more oil from the Middle East?

8207 2018-09-20 11:28:21 FUN FACT: Our sundowning president just publicly threatened harm to oil producing countries if they don't lower their prices on light sweet crude.
8208 2018-09-20 11:28:19 If the US is now the leader of oil production then market law says we can control the price of the market.  Why do we care about OPEC in current markets? Why are US prices even tied to OPEC?
8209 2018-09-20 11:28:18 You just imposed sanctions on one of the leading oil producers in the Middle East, and you're now blaming OPEC? Iran was ready to produce & export more, which would've brought down the price, but have now been forced to slash output. Who's advising you on laws of supply & demand?
8210 2018-09-20 11:28:08 No, we need to produce our own oil! Now! We don’t need OPEC!
8211 2018-09-20 11:28:01 There is no OPEC monopoly. We buy most of our oil from Canada and Mexico. Your mad you can't control the oil in OPEC nations. Venezuela Iran Iraq Libya to name a few. You giving weapons to Saudi and begging for oil increase. Don't blame it on OPEC. Your not protecting nothing.
8212 2018-09-20 11:28:00 We protect the countries of the Middle East, she would be not sure for a long time without us, and they push continue on higher oil prices. We will not forget. The OPEC monopoly prices must go down!

8227 2018-09-20 11:27:04 @jaketapper .. care to comment?
8228 2018-09-20 11:26:51 What do you know! Something we both agree on. Being that a majority of export in the Middle East is oil, there should be no reason that they are trying to hold the rest of the world hostage with their prices. While they should make money, they should not be able to price gouge
8229 2018-09-20 11:26:50 A review of history would benefit you.  ARAMCO (a U.S. company) was for many years the driver behind OPEC. Now you expect the oil exporting nations to voluntarily lower their price?  If you want to practice imperialism, then say so.
8230 2018-09-20 11:26:49 Why is high oil prices bothering you? It’s been higher in the past.
8231 2018-09-20 11:26:48 I would urge you to find someone who can read, and them to read about the history of oil particularly in relation to Americas dealings with OPEC and the Middle East generally. They will tell you that it ended badly.

8233 2018-09-20 11:26:42 Does it Dawn on you that prices went up right after you got in.  Coincidence?  What are your holdings and dealings in oil.

8235 2018-09-20 11:26:41 @realDonaldTrump did you get the new iPhone Xs Maaaax before your sanction  hit the price for basic American?  And Iranian sanction could be the source of high oil prices? Basic maths of supply and demand.
8236 2018-09-20 11:26:41 You need to decide either lower dollar or lower oil price, not both, impossible
8237 2018-09-20 11:26:38 Thank you! No bowing down to these oil producers. You have the right idea.
8238 2018-09-20 11:26:37 Every environmental catastrophe—lest we forget. Trump smog, trumptastrophic oil spill. Replace name for traitor from Benedict Arnold to Donald Trump. Also make Trump the name to relay lechery (& treachery)! Ooo...& for spending lavishly while dead broke.
8239 2018-09-20 11:26:36 Unleash the Permian Trump. There are a lot of cash strapped companies that need funding to reduce the pipeline bottleneck and improve the transportation of oil to market. There is a company looking to store oil.Lack of US produced oil is a national defense matter. @HurdOnTheHill
8240 2018-09-20 11:26:29 Because we do that all by ourselves, w/no help from other countries/coalitions like NATO, United Nations, etc. Why should we worry about higher oil prices? You've bragged repeatedly about us being self-sufficient thanks to you & your opening up our Federal lands for oil drilling.
8241 2018-09-20 11:26:29 As I have stated before, don't be surprised if Trump orders release of strategic oil reserves and a slowdown of Iran Sanctions taking effect to keep prices low before the midterms.
8242 2018-09-20 11:26:23 Spoken like a man who truly understands what the hell hes taliking about. Know what will bring down oil prices genius? Us being less dependent on oil! Solar energy, reusable energy. How bout that?
8243 2018-09-20 11:26:21 Protect? There have been hundreds of thousands of deaths in the region since America started 'protecting'. You are only interested in the oil. No attention at all given to the deaths of civilians, including children, in Yemen and Palestine.
8244 2018-09-20 11:26:20 There was a time America commended respect ... now a laughing joke .,, there is nothing you can do about Iran ballistic programme unless you want $200 baril of oil
8245 2018-09-20 11:26:18 We should be producing our own oil and limiting our own exports to keep oil affordable in the USA. MidEast countries will fight perpetually because they are oil producing and their religion of Islam breeds violence against anyone else. You fix that by not engaging at all. MAGA

8260 2018-09-20 11:24:57 Your oil company friends disagree with your idea of low oil prices and didn’t America recently become the highest producer country?
8261 2018-09-20 11:24:47 And if anybody remembers. The price of a oil only skyrocketed after the US / Uk  had invaded Iraq..
8262 2018-09-20 11:24:41 Because he’s living in the 1950’s! Plus he probably owns oil stocks and is getting big $’s to his campaign from them. 
8263 2018-09-20 11:24:39 When I saw oil above $71 & Brent near $80 today, I was really surprised, but am I the only one who gives a hoot ?!?

8266 2018-09-20 11:24:34 Oil price 70$ or 80$ is the big fake price artificially raised by some organization (including Opec). Oil fair price is should be 30-50$ maximum.
8267 2018-09-20 11:24:33 Define protect, and safe from whom?  Bye-the-bye, the U.S. has been EXPORTING record amounts of oil.
8268 2018-09-20 11:24:32 Thought U.S. was producing enough to not need their oil?

What happened? What made our dependency change?

Do you have ANY clue of what you’re doing??
8269 2018-09-20 11:24:25 You really have no idea how oil prices work do you?

8275 2018-09-20 11:23:56 You do know that the U.S. has a thriving oil industry. I guess those jobs don’t matter.
8276 2018-09-20 11:23:46 The best way to lower oil prices is to promote renewable energy and  domestic gas.
8277 2018-09-20 11:23:41 You need deliverance with a drum of anointing oil

8285 2018-09-20 11:23:19 Instead of oil, why not invest more into green resources with incentives that will help Americans? Lower prices by making the demand less.
8286 2018-09-20 11:23:18 Somehow I still remember the president of Venezuela offering to give us oil. Cinco de Mayo celebrates Pancho Villa's victory over the French Foreign Legion. opium in South America was planted there by the French Foreign Legion. War injuries you know

8289 2018-09-20 11:23:13 We could ingrate our oil with a compound, that will make it better fuels in the long run, at the same time desensitize the common thesis, that the oil should be higher of price when it alternates in value.

8301 2018-09-20 11:22:35 Don't protect them then. Let them see what it's like without our protection. Then they will reconsider there oil/gas prices.

8316 2018-09-20 11:21:53 How simple are you? How simple do you think your followers are?

US spends military money overseas for 1, and only 1 reason.....to protect US interests around the world.

And by the way, if oil prices plummet, much of US production (e.g. fracking) stops.

Too complex for you?
8317 2018-09-20 11:21:49 No word about Russia, the world's #1 oil producer..
8318 2018-09-20 11:21:48 yes indeed. They are ruining our economy by pushing up oil price higher and higher.
8319 2018-09-20 11:21:43 How about we stop exporting our oil and use it instead?
8320 2018-09-20 11:21:36 yeah oil pretty much determines the country's fate
8321 2018-09-20 11:21:25 There’s only two ways out: Find enough oil to be oil independent or pushed alternatives that bypass petrochemical dependency. Considering America consumes a quarter of the worlds resources, I doubt you’ll find enough to be oil independent so...

8326 2018-09-20 11:21:19 price of oil is caring
8327 2018-09-20 11:21:19 Hi, hope you are well. I run a successful business called Golden Oil Stretch Marks massage therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
8328 2018-09-20 11:21:18 Golden rule... he who has the gold makes the rules. 

Their oil, their rules. 

A real leader would be leading this country away from oil and the need for OPEC.... but we all know you’re not a real leader so we are at OPEC’s mercy. Good job !!

8332 2018-09-20 11:21:11 Yeah, you can always invade their countries and take the oil for free.
8333 2018-09-20 11:21:09 At the moment, UKOG & ANGS are testing. Whereas UJO will be drilling in Nov but still need rig confirmation. Oil is there in Bisc, just need thick zone. V likely it will be one of the big hit of 2018

Some time ago, we did a insightful interview with Tom Mueller, author of "Extra Virginity" a account of olive oil culture, history, and crime.

Read his answers on these questions: (see next tweet)

8335 2018-09-20 11:21:04 Didn’t Obama do that for 8 years?  Billions  wasted. Alternative energy sources will work when they’re  profitable in the free market. They’re getting there.... but oil will always be here.
8336 2018-09-20 11:21:03 America only protects their interests in Middle East ,buy oil sell weapons .
8337 2018-09-20 11:21:02 Yeah stop protecting the Middle East, let's see what oil prices do then... tart...
8338 2018-09-20 11:21:01 Oil gona die a slow death. EV @Tesla is tghe future..
8339 2018-09-20 11:21:01 How can the turkana oil help Kenya? Of course apart from benefitting  the cartels? #TaxVoteKe #FuelPriceHike
8340 2018-09-20 11:20:56 Nice oil field you got there. It’d be a shame if something happened to it
8341 2018-09-20 11:20:52 So I guess if oil prices get down, you'll ask credit for it ... This is the Trump book ... Anything goes well we need to thank Trump, anything turn wrong, it must be others fault.
8342 2018-09-20 11:20:44 Trying to manipulate the markets again?  Did you give your buddy Icahn the heads up before he shorted oil stocks?
8343 2018-09-20 11:20:42 This statement by you doesn’t sound like your campaign promises or you personally. Listen to yourself. Really? We’re in the Mid East giving lives of our soldiers to fight to keep oil producing countries safe so oil prices are affordable? Say it isn’t so! Get US out now! #MAGA
8344 2018-09-20 11:20:40 interesting... wonder what the #Saudis will say. Of course #oil prices would not be so high if US had  not left @theIrandeal
8345 2018-09-20 11:20:36 US stock futures are up 0.15% with Europe also positive and Asia mixed.  Oil is $71.55 with gold at $1,207. Green lights on the drive today.
8346 2018-09-20 11:20:30 Why don't we just use our own oil?
8347 2018-09-20 11:20:30 Israel sells no oil. ???
8348 2018-09-20 11:20:29 America chose to release crude oil. However, if oil prices are not centered on OPEC, it will dry up in three months. The important thing is to govern. I think the major is impossible to learn in the Little League.

8350 2018-09-20 11:20:27 #RT @realDonaldTrump: We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
8351 2018-09-20 11:20:26 Yep proves that he meets the LNP standard of snake oil salesman
8352 2018-09-20 11:20:21 And you’re no doubt thinking, hey, I should throw a tariff on the oil, that’ll show ‘em.
8353 2018-09-20 11:20:19 According to the evening express the AWPR could have been open weeks ago if it wasn't for the damage/ oil spills caused by this event
8354 2018-09-20 11:20:18 Right....and us protecting the Middle East has nothing to do with protecting the Oil in the ground, right?
8355 2018-09-20 11:20:18 We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!
8356 2018-09-20 11:20:15 If the government didn't heavily subsidize the U.S. oil industry, we'd be paying $10 a gallon for gas like the rest of the industrialized world.
8357 2018-09-20 11:20:12 Finally shedding some light on this. Sounds like more haters are converting... And all you had to do was to advocate cheap oil prices. Unfortunatelly gasoline prices aren’t going down. Why would that be?
8358 2018-09-20 11:20:12 @SquawkCNBC he’s done everything his buddies wanted to raise the price of oil. He’s so full of crap

8360 2018-09-20 11:20:05 No Donny. Kissinger promised the protection of the US Mercenaries, sorry, military, in return for trading oil in US$. Your just protecting your oil interests and your people are dying because of it. The US created OPEC.
8361 2018-09-20 11:20:04 100% agree with President @realDonaldTrump. Crude oil prices are souring and must be brought to level 30-40 USD per barrel.

8367 2018-09-20 11:19:39 Iranian oil? Is that the answer
8368 2018-09-20 11:19:39 You want lower oil prices? Let Iran pump and sell oil.
8369 2018-09-20 11:19:38 #UJO coming ( we know oil is there )
8370 2018-09-20 11:19:33 Indeed, Chavez only made his policies towards increasing literacy rates, provide housing and improving infrastructure, while still clinging to oil as Venezuela's main source of wealth, which was one of the big factors why the country got crippled in the late 70s and the 80s.

8373 2018-09-20 11:19:24 Most Presidents say we are protecting the Middle East without bringing up the oil. Trump makes a terrible mafia boss.
8374 2018-09-20 11:19:22 Are you suggesting that we only help to protect those that provide cheap oil?

8378 2018-09-20 11:19:10 Is protecting the Middle East aiming to find peace in the Region or just better oil deals?
And by the way, oil prices increase is also good for US producers and companies so what’s the point of this tweet?
8379 2018-09-20 11:19:08 How can the turkana oil help Kenya? Of course apart from benefitting  the cartels?

8381 2018-09-20 11:19:07 Why not use the oil drilled IN the U.S.A?
8382 2018-09-20 11:19:07 No intention of negativity. Because something has been done before does not make it undesirable. If I could get someone to paint my partner with the same brilliance a heap of readies would materialize in an instant. I look at the rubbish oil of my father at Berrington and despair

8387 2018-09-20 11:18:45 You gave the oil companies billions in tax breaks with your #GOPTaxScam. Why hasn't that resulted in lower prices? Guess they prefer to hold on to their profits and screw the American people. Same thing will happen with this proposal. #NotOurPresident #UnfitForOffice #Impeach
8388 2018-09-20 11:18:42 Oil price is tied to demand is tied to increasingly  successful economies throughout  the world. Honest Don it's your success in making America great again that inspires increase in economic  activity and therefore higher oil prices.
8389 2018-09-20 11:18:42 You must try to remember your lies. You said months ago that you had spoken to the Saudi government and arranged a reduction in the oil price. Either you have the power or you are a lame duck.

8391 2018-09-20 11:18:32 The Middle East does not control OPEC.
OPEC talked 8 other countries into to reducing production to inflate the prices of oil. This is Market manipulation by the OPEC Collective which is highly controlled by the United States greedy oil companies. Educate yourself before tweeting
8392 2018-09-20 11:18:32 which castor oil, the one we give to kids?
8393 2018-09-20 11:18:30 Donnie duderead some science.  Oil is a dead end, there are ZERO economic wins in Oil anymore. It is all about Renewables; Hydro, Solar, Wind, Tidal, etc.   Upgrade your science to the 21rst century and maybe you will see. Otherwise keep operating on old knowledge and fail often
8394 2018-09-20 11:18:29 Bit more complicated than lower oil prices = safer countries and communities, Donny...

8398 2018-09-20 11:18:24 How about switching to renewables, the you wouldn’t have to worry about Saudi oil tariffs? Doesn’t that make sense?
8399 2018-09-20 11:18:24 Its not a monopoly its a cartel. And they can set the prices cause it's their oil. Once again, Trump does the "nice country, it would be ca shame if something happened to it" bullshit
8400 2018-09-20 11:18:21 We regularly invade the countries of the Middle East, they are not safe for very long because of us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will simply have to invade again and just take their oil!
8401 2018-09-20 11:18:20 It is called "supply and demand" - We cannot try to extort lower prices -- Best way to stop this practice is to stop being oil dependent. Push for scientific answers by promoting those seeking ways to remove that dependency.
8402 2018-09-20 11:18:19 Wow, let’s just blackmail other countries so we can get cheaper oil

8411 2018-09-20 11:18:12 Bullshit. Better idea would be to reduce efficiently the need of oil, through efficient to cars, saving energy, and not buying every new toy, because it's hip. That would save much more than just US money.

8418 2018-09-20 11:18:04 The only way OPEC can “lower” prices is to increase production, which also increases competition with US oil producers while driving the price down below where we can compete and hurts US jobs!

We invaded the middle east. On false pretenses. What are we protecting them from? 

And weren't you going to make oil prices come down significantly? They've gone up since you took office.
8430 2018-09-20 11:17:38 The biggest problem is the oil barons & the current associated petrol & diesel industries. How to switch. will be a slow transition & not without some issues. Norway can make it work with such a small population. They are organised.

8445 2018-09-20 11:17:09 realDonaldTrump Oil prices are high, but you could make a huge difference if you focused on moving forward our green technology.  We could be energy independent if we had a President who was set on moving away from Oil and Coal!
8446 2018-09-20 11:17:09 realDonaldTrump If they don't lower prices, what will you do, threaten to go to war with them and take their oil, like you have done in the past?
8447 2018-09-20 11:17:08 We need to be energy independent. Why don’t we refine our own oil for petro instead of getting it on the open market? You can dial back our supplies coming from OPEC simply by demanding US supplies be domestic only. I’m sure it’s not that simple but you get where I’m coming from!

If renewables were reliable, they would not need constant FF backup.
Renewables simply cannot hack it. Why do you think we previously replaced windmills with coal, then oil & gas, & nuclear?
8452 2018-09-20 11:16:52 I've seen some really desperate reasoning why the oil price will go down today.

These kind of people get wiped out. They haven't realised the trend they are fighting is strong.

8508 2018-09-20 11:14:48 What about exports and imports which are just the opposite of supply and demand? When a country exports oil it has a surplus of supply, yet reduces inventory, which suggests just the opposite: short supply. So a country can create a short supply situation (high prices)by exports.

8584 2018-09-20 11:08:07 Both proposals are there, but it doesn’t make sense at all, we have Somali ports which is 300 km away, so building pipelines to Djibouti or Eritrea isn’t feasible. Just remember, these oil fields are right to next Somali border.

8638 2018-09-20 11:00:06 That would be great, it would allow us an even clearer view of the oil rigs that NR constructed on the Great Western Electrification (without necessary consultation in an AONB) route. Sensible tree management is welcomed, scorched earth is not.

8642 2018-09-20 10:59:01 C-tax and cap and trade inevitably fail due to industrial lobbying  (big oil, big polluters, other interest groups). That is a false argument against C-tax!

US and CND are far from C-neutral.

8649 2018-09-20 10:58:06 @jesstagirl good morning. Seeing the story about using dry shampoo reminded me that sometimes I would sprinkle a little bit of baby powder on my hair to absorb the oil and brush it out.

- Market outlook for oil is positive which is correlated to stronger Ruble
- Surprising interest rate hike by Russia's central bank should build more demand for Russian Ruble

8713 2018-09-20 10:48:20 huge mistake. Remember the 2016 presidential election. Almost all of them said that Hilary is going to win. S he lost. And who do you think is behind the current New Normalism in the west? However, we'll need to be more Wise and strategic. oïl sanctions are working. But it could
8714 2018-09-20 10:48:17 But their job was to listen to SCIENTIST years ago, and develop a strategy. You know, Do The Right Thing, not take money from the oil industry to pretend it wasn’t happening...
8715 2018-09-20 10:48:15 I have prosecuted hundreds of dagga smokers in my life for not only possession or trading of dagga but for a variety of criminal actions performed while they were stoned There may be the occasional user that will never cause problems or the oil may be useful but dagga is bad news

8723 2018-09-20 10:46:23 @FannyFascar I vehemently disagree with your report. @WinnersChapelNL does not sell anointing oil to its members. Next time, do a proper DD with a view to producing a credible report. Your scripting is fraught with several inaccuracies but you can do better.

8725 2018-09-20 10:45:50 It’s got NOTHING to do with PCs and everything to do with oil prices. Carbon tax is still in place

8727 2018-09-20 10:45:26 Indeed Michael! The snake is as addicted to oil as is EU transport. Let's go zero-emission.
BTW, what was your best score?
8728 2018-09-20 10:45:23 This situation allows OPEC, which has spare production capacity, to control the total global oil supply and therefore oil pricing. OPEC has raised crude oil prices by a factor of about four since 2002, reducing world demand.        Lazy bum

8737 2018-09-20 10:42:18 the truth in somewhere in the middle Certainly the oil boom went to the treasury x who knows what it went on!
8738 2018-09-20 10:42:17 the good news is that they've shifted to saying "oil production will start falling 3 years from now" instead of "the current level is unsustainable" or "Russia has already run out"

8749 2018-09-20 10:39:34 We discovered 3 substance that match your criteria.
The first substance is a black flameable substance composed of dead beings, located on planet earth in the Sol-system. It appears the primitive species burns the so called "oil" to generate energy plastic.

8760 2018-09-20 10:38:14 This is an inaccurate report. @WinnersChapelNL does not sell Anointing Oil to its members. The reporter should have done her DD before conjuring her script.
8761 2018-09-20 10:38:03 Is this happening now? I'm coming to join. We must revel against this exploitation. We are not oil fields.

8780 2018-09-20 10:33:17 However, I'd argue that these policies were quite quickly abandoned due to Iraqi rejection of them and within a few years, the US were actually building Iraqi budgetary capacity (with eventual "success") that allowed the old economy to survive and continue sucking oil revenues

8837 2018-09-20 10:24:05 Yup, and the Wild West had its share of Snake Oil salesmen. that's about all I see on here, you guys care as much about 'humanity' in this new gold rush, as Wall St. And while you don't HAVE to be any better, y'all really could be. Pump and dump, dressed up as 'disruption' ha!

8841 2018-09-20 10:23:34 Hey here's a thought - stop referring to people as "resource". Coal, oil, and gas are resources - inanimate things you can burn for profit until they're useless. Consider the implication.

8850 2018-09-20 10:22:15 Listening to discussions on Africa's environment assets and sustainable development. #africa needs to value its environmental assets, assets without a value, are just assets, reduce illicit outflows and focus on value addition. Kenya should export refined oil, not crude oil

8856 2018-09-20 10:20:41 There is a fact, no country will support Pakistan at this juncture....To my mind, even Saudi Arabia too will gradually isolate itself from #Pakistan as India is Saudi's biggest oil importer and of course it would also not like to import Pak terrorists. @ImranKhanPTI

WHY are higher oil prices BETTER for the economy?

8912 2018-09-20 10:10:09 The lack of a price spike definitely has nothing to do with the insane oil output the US has thanks to the fracking industry that is booming as a result of the progress towards eliminating our coal power plans

8918 2018-09-20 10:08:46 So it may be a case that buying Legal Weed stocks is analogous to buying Standard Oil in 1870 prior to the building of their 1st pipeline in 1873, (which crashed the railroads and US economy), in that the Legal Weed Market is still underdeveloped - but major players will emerge.
8919 2018-09-20 10:08:39 that is my point..I could go on and on here.
Sometimes the excitement and planning of something is better than the event which can go a bit flat.
I mean, I would say Christmas can be a bit like that when you see all the washing up.

8940 2018-09-20 10:03:26 @realDonaldTrump For us, the cutoff between China and India's oil exports is more important than the rest of the world, India and China will not cut their oil, the sanctions will be ineffective and will not be worth it

8991 2018-09-20 09:51:23 The most common issue is that the parts in yourengine will become too hot. This can cause the engine to run less efficiently, and as time goes on, it can cause the engine components to warp and wear out. Eventually, if the oil is not changed, the entire engine will shut down.

8996 2018-09-20 09:50:44 I disagree that you say there are no renewables,wood is renewable,but pollutes a lot more than natural gas,propane,gasoline,and even oil.coal is one thing that pollutes more than wood,but coal is very abundant and cheap even with the scrubbers used to clean up the emissions

9095 2018-09-20 09:35:59 I agree. Fuel prices are all time high. One of the reasons is global price rise. But India has not seen an equally sharp rise. We're a fair bit cushioned. One more reason for high prices is Oil Bonds. The question of repayment and how much we have repaid is up for discussion.

9106 2018-09-20 09:33:25 People are waking up. Encouraging! Personally, I avoid the soy, xanthum gum, carrageenan and canola oil in many of these products & go organic if you can (glyphosate). So Delicious, Amy's, Califia Farms and Organic Girl are ones off the top of my head that get . Be well.

9133 2018-09-20 09:29:22 Thanks to advances in shale drilling, the U.S. is now the world's No. 2 oil producer, trailing only Russia. The U.S. is already the world's top natural gas producer, and, according to the International Energy Association, is expected to account for

That multi-£billion oil tanker could never be stopped in a month

9142 2018-09-20 09:27:56 it was introduced when the price of oil was low, so makes  sense to keep it now that the price is high ... NPP logic

9155 2018-09-20 09:26:08 How about a fetish for rolling in ordinary oil spills under cars, sounds good to me!
9156 2018-09-20 09:26:00 I hear that. I've taken to freezing some into ice cube trays with juice, water or oil, on the days I have energy. 

It cuts down on waste and makes bad days a bit easier. But some days you just need to get through it.

9168 2018-09-20 09:24:53 It damn well ought to. The oil industry should have been taking this seriously 10-20 years ago, instead of protecting their own interests.

9175 2018-09-20 09:23:58 @adamboultonSKY @Nigel_Farage Norway created a sovereign wealth fund from the proceeds of their oil and gas reserves. That’s why they were in the position to negotiate a trading position with the EU and we are not. They’re in a position to pay in because they have all that money

9189 2018-09-20 09:22:27 Including olive oil and coconut oil?
9190 2018-09-20 09:22:22 Notes: just wash, remove stalks, chop okra into chunks. Don't worry about "dry it off, because of slime" - that's not something I've ever encountered. Oil in pan, with spices, hat, add okra, add chopped tomato, once it's had a quick fry, then add fluid* as required to keep moist.
9191 2018-09-20 09:22:09 Add Russia's Eritrean port as another potential chokepoint for oil & thinga hurt quick

9193 2018-09-20 09:22:00 Wasn't the Scottish plan based on a wildly unrealistic forecast of rising oil prices, which at current levels would have left a £30bn hole in their finances? Some plan
9194 2018-09-20 09:21:55 No, I don't. That's not what we were discussing. You said much of Scotland's reserves are off the coast of  Northumberland. Show me the evidence. Also, Scotland has other natural resources apart from oil. It just so happens WM has stolen Scotland's oil wealth.
9195 2018-09-20 09:21:50 Sir this system was working also in MMS govt when Iran had sanctions and india was still allowed to import oil despite the American sanctions. Sir aap aajkal zyada hi main main par rahe ho har baat par

9422 2018-09-20 08:44:43 I may start with my companies under coverage. I've seen charts from peak oil sites, not sure of data. When one says that super major production is the lowest since 197(x) but doesn't mention the wave of nationalisations after opec oil rises as the reason why they lost capacity

9687 2018-09-20 07:55:52 I would suggest to learn basics of petroleum trade.

1. Crude is imported by Oil Cos for refinement and it is exported back at negotiated rates without any levies.

2. Petrol & Diesel is sold within India after levying margins & Taxes.

Expect markets to drop further should they announce inflation to hit 7.5% - 8% in the next few months and if the 3rd Quarter GDP falls below 6%. Add that to high oil and the high dollar.

What is your trading plan?
9846 2018-09-20 07:26:07 How much did an oil company pay you to tweet this. All those electric cars in Norway and Canada been fine in the cold for years..... Oh silly me I forget most people are completely ignorant and uneducated, that's why you tweeted this.
9847 2018-09-20 07:25:53 Might be worth telling people what is an alternative renewable source of oil to look out for in their products? Just a thought.

9849 2018-09-20 07:25:46 C'mon Tris it's an accepted fact that devalued £ puts upwards pressure on inflation. Good for exports. Though. Suppliers have tried to absorb costs but eventually they have to pass it on. As a middle class metropolitan elite it pushes up my croissant and olive oil costs
9850 2018-09-20 07:25:38 So it's a trade off?

Quit the licence and get oil?

9888 2018-09-20 07:20:13 SARB on the horns of a dilemma. The MPC needs to balance ZAR decline & higher oil prices against a widening output gap. But, an upward revision to its inflation forecast provides a reason to hike rates & USD/ZAR retracing to 14.70 has reduced the probability of a rate hike today.

9910 2018-09-20 07:16:19 In my opinion (take it or leave it) CBD oil is medicine. Some people might have adverse symptoms to THC but for most part it is harmless to everything except ambition and it can make a person amoral for the same reason ambition is tampered. Depends how it is used really and why.

9978 2018-09-20 07:03:00 One aspect you won't touch on is Swiss financial control of US economy.  Investments in insurance companies, Pharmaceuticals (which is just a brance of Big Oil).  Your Medicare 4 All debate always says all other countries have it.   Not Switzerland!
9979 2018-09-20 07:02:50 Lavender oil & ocean wave sounds are proven to help with quicker & sounder sleep
9980 2018-09-20 07:02:46 The system in place of politburo and central committee imported from China is designed for a one party state! It is not designed for a democracy! Therefore Zanu PF is trying to mix 2 systems which are oil and water and end-up with a  democratic system! It just won't happen
9981 2018-09-20 07:02:39 My brother it  is evident buhari and his ilk never had any intention of making anything work,i had always had my reservations. They just wanted to snake oil their way to score cheap political point. I give up on this nation. Who can even save this nation in the next poll??

9983 2018-09-20 07:02:13 When you take your car for an oil change that is all they do, they don’t check anything else
9984 2018-09-20 07:02:07 それがいいところなんだと思うけど…。わたし的には、今まで通りの狭い空間でわちゃわちゃしてる方がいいかな
9985 2018-09-20 07:02:04 Okay we get it, someone’s daughter needs to get an oil change

9987 2018-09-20 07:01:34 Just another reason why I NEED to come (and move?) to Canada!! 

So far I like the one that is based on coconut oil and flavored with lavender the most. The one with the 'anti-stress'-essence comes second! Gonna test some other combinations the next days! 
9988 2018-09-20 07:01:32 โอ๊ยร้อนน่าจะรอพ่อมารับ

9991 2018-09-20 07:01:10 Try rubbing some peppermint essential oil on your temples or having a cup of peppermint tea? Or lavender essential oil on the upper lip & inhale.  

Hope you feel better soon!
9992 2018-09-20 07:01:07 キャリアオイルの種類・グレープシードオイル/ Grapeseed oil
ブドウ科、種。保湿、収斂、抗酸化。粘性が低くさらっとした使い心地ですが、保湿効果があります。そのため、脂性肌や混合肌の人にも使いやすいオイルの一つです。浸透力は普通。やや酸化しやすい。

9998 2018-09-20 07:00:42 Oil nations rich in oil are producing at record numbers, bcoz oil may have no future once renewal energy is developed. Likewise our nation India is rich in minerals  needs to mine when there is demand and make most of it.

10000 2018-09-20 07:00:22 Such an exciting prospect with bullish oil/gas market. Would imagine reserves will be upgraded on many of these assets, deferring decommissioning and confident of further value adding acquisitions #RRE
10001 2018-09-20 07:00:15 Will continue to go through #RRE update today and next couple.  Glad to be positioned.  Glad they didn't report on same day as #RPT and #SQZ (them two still coming).  Oil Brent futures just shy of $80
10002 2018-09-20 07:00:15 Amazing that anyone thought #matd could find commercial oil in Mongolia. When is it time to close this business?

10004 2018-09-20 06:59:46 It is appalling. I try and stick with making everything myself. Palm oil in the strangest of things too, and no healthier than butter in reality.
10005 2018-09-20 06:59:30 Killed my gym sesh now I wish I was getting a good full body oil massage 
10006 2018-09-20 06:59:21 These ppl tell blantant lies about the oil sands. Alberta is the MOST ETHICAL oil producer globally. We are a leader in technology that is eco friendly. Wait until a train filled with oil details in Burnaby. These buffoons don't want SAFE pipelines
10007 2018-09-20 06:59:17 I also worked at a Toyota dealership for 20 years and about 18 yrs ago there was a lawsuit by owners saying that the cars oil was turning to sludge, Toyota said it was because the people were not changing their oil enough, so if you do not change your oil it turns to sludge
10008 2018-09-20 06:58:58 Obviously Edo is not a strategic State of interest to the OGA at the Top and the puppet that is overseeing the state Remit monthly and yearly Oil revenue to his master quietly and he gets a commission too. Ask me what is marginalisation and I will point to you Edo State people’s
