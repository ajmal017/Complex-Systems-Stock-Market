2 2018-12-16 23:50:44 #Shorten is setting up the election battleground as a fight for middle Australia as he cranked up class-warfare rhetoric pledging to stop working people being treated like commodities.

Get real - his Union Masters will always see us a commodities.

3 2018-12-16 23:34:30 If Buhari had taken over from the military in 1999, by now, we would still be queuing up at NITEL phone booths.

Nigerians will still be buying milk, sugar,rice and other essential commodities from behind trucks supervised by military men with koboko..

@Ifeanyi Baron
4 2018-12-16 23:20:33 imagine when commodities take off 
5 2018-12-16 23:18:38 So they’re predicting an increase in commodities prices, not a decrease like almost everyone else on the planet?
6 2018-12-16 23:08:30 O problema é que tá desde 2014 umas das maiores oportunidades da história para comprar commodities. E o mundo não anda, nem elas sobem de fato. Vamos para o 5o ano. Good luck.
7 2018-12-16 23:03:40 AUD behaves as a risk asset, given its proxy to commodities demand and links with China's economy. When risk is on, AUD usually strengthens. But lately AUD local economy has been having its own issues (housing slowdown etc. and the RBA on hold rather than raising, so correlations
8 2018-12-16 23:02:21 Remember when there was the utopian idea of "post-scarcity" and how we'd have to invent ways to have scarce commodities for the purposes of social reproduction? Lol.
9 2018-12-16 23:00:32 This was the year where bitcoin died. I literally never trade cryptocurrencies because of shit like bitcoin. Never sustainable trades. Stick to stocks/forex/commodities. Bitcoin has no directional bias whatsoever
10 2018-12-16 22:49:11 What can 10k do for a common Nigerian ? Even aboki that sells pure water in that little kiosk that trade with that especially with the current prices of commodities in the market. God will punish this evil minded leaders.
11 2018-12-16 22:45:29 This is an unintended consequence of parents treating their children as fragile, breakable commodities which must be protected from any form of adversity whatsoever.  The school system perpetuated this nonsense, so we have a generation of youngsters totally unable to cope
12 2018-12-16 22:42:22 Sunday night calls: corn, soybeans and wheat mixed to up 1 cent. Focus is on China’s ag buying or lack of buying program this week. The trade is anticipating larger purchases of #soybeans, #corn, ddg’s and meat. This is the last full #trading week of the year.
13 2018-12-16 22:37:06 Your life would be SO much easier, you'd have REAL friends, good and GENUINE relationships with your family and REAL love with a REAL wife, if you'd JUST be honest, have integrity and help people instead of using them like commodities. Death, pain and anger will be your legacy.
14 2018-12-16 22:34:02 Someday, we’ll address those women that have commercialized relationships and reduced women in general to commodities that can be bought at a price.
15 2018-12-16 22:30:24 Series of the manipulation. Who’s the owner? The real players, The POLITICIANS  versus CLERGYman over Nigerian COMMODITIES{masses}
16 2018-12-16 22:17:23 Normalmente ñ. O histórico é de porrada c/ commodities andando e S&P de lado/subindo muito pouco. No início da descida os dois caem, mas commodities caem muito mais, colapsam. No final da descida, commodities continuam caindo menos e S&P subindo.

Mas pd ser diferente no futuro.
17 2018-12-16 22:10:45 I enter 2019 employed full time for the first time since 2007 while #RBNY winters in Tucson in prep for CCLand my new local club @NewMexicoUTD starts play.

Time, focus, and space in my heart are the scarce commodities.

I'm unnerved
18 2018-12-15 23:48:19 I’m going to be an adult come 2019. Don’t hit my line unless we talking about Pork belly stock price trends & other commodities
19 2018-12-15 23:43:56 SDR basket of currency and commodities to regain some trust as governments will still be in control - just BROKE. Plus with global reset the "powers that be", wont allow war as is waste of money and without way to pay each other can't make money from it
20 2018-12-15 23:43:51 Unfortunately for some, they are not children, they are commodities 
21 2018-12-15 23:31:54 “Normalizing the act of buying sex also debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. If paying for sex is normalized, then every young boy will learn that women and girls are commodities to be bought and sold."
22 2018-12-15 23:25:22 The range of products that can be used to trade on EOSex will expand considerably: crypto currencies, stocks, currency, commodities - EOSex will become a truly one-stop shopping center for trading assets.

23 2018-12-15 23:12:39 Na hora que o bicho pega o CHF volta a ter o seu status de reserva de valor...NOK não gosto porque no cenário descrito commodities podem sofrer bastante
24 2018-12-15 23:09:42 Vamos fazer as contas: projeção de crescimento do PIB mundial: decrescente; PIB.BR19: 2,5%; crise de commodities para 2019; Brasil dependente de exportação se afasta da China e leva um tombo dos EUA;safra futura de soja  brasileira encalhada vai pro valor mínimo.Mostra tua conta.
25 2018-12-15 23:06:18 La riqueza d todas estas naciones que te nombré,empieza con las divisas que generan esos commodities q exportan. Aprovechan esas ventajas comparativas q le dan esos commodities e innovan tecnológicamente en esas aéreas. No ensamblan autos o celulares ni se ponen a fabricar ropa.
26 2018-12-15 22:50:17 Governments manipulate currencies all the time... Especially export economies like China and Japan... They need their currencies to be artificially low.. so that their commodities can be attractive to foreign buyers..
27 2018-12-15 22:46:13 Every single commodity's price is lower today,still people tend to forget. BJP should come out with chart of all commodities.
28 2018-12-15 22:43:02 Go back to commodities.  Give some canned goods and cheese.  Don’t give money. Give food.
29 2018-12-15 22:37:58 After the commodities boom ended and the ‘Wealth Effect’ is over with asset prices dropping, Govt has turned to immigration for growth. I guess they are praying for another commodities boom to squander. Ponzi economics 
30 2018-12-15 22:36:33 "commodities" might be too wide a purview, unless you are implying that in reality only ONE commodity will turn positively south, i.e. fiat currencies. Not that I disagree, I am only postulating that it would be a different kettle of fish, more on a 1974 scenario.
31 2018-12-15 22:18:35 Shouldn’t commodities lead equities?
32 2018-12-15 22:13:28 People always ask how we'd fund Basic Income if not through backdoor socialism, and to that I say put a 90 percent capital gains tax on the derivatives industry but exempt anyone who takes delivery of tangible physical commodities.
33 2018-12-15 21:48:20 Not sure how it plays out.
But there will be global and/or .gov cryptos backed by hard assets.

No reason states/municipalities/individuals can't have cryptos trade like commodities that are likewise backed by our productivity, data, and similar assets.

It's all going to change.
34 2018-12-15 21:20:58 (Thread) Water Polution

Seeing as you won’t shut up, here is one for you leading into the new year. I’ll work on the actual numbers for pipelines and desalination in correlation with true market costs of commodities. But here’s the run down of one example.
35 2018-12-15 21:16:23 Indices? Bubble
Real estate? Bubble
Fixed income? Bankrupt
Bonds? Inverted yield curve
Commodities? Maybe
New asset class? No brainer

Where will the $ go?

36 2018-12-15 21:08:05 Absolutely NOT. The entire point of this central banking fiasco and fiat money system collapse is a destruction of faith in governments and central banking authority. The only thing the govts will decide is what commodities to back BTC & LTC with. Maybe a couple other Cryptos too
37 2018-12-14 23:56:36 The good news is Mike that this is not related to supply/demand as much as the power of our government to rig prices of commodities. When you understand that the Fed's biggest fear is an economic recovery you are getting deeper in the rabbit hole. No rabbits only bones. #HFT
38 2018-12-14 23:39:30 Ésta señora no entiende que en la Argentina no se agrega valor (exportamos commodities sin valor industrial) porque es la única manera se que el Estado te robe lo menos posible con impuestos. Aún así roban con las retenciones..
39 2018-12-14 23:35:20 Entonces esto no fue crear riquezas. Simplemente coincidieron con que los precios de los commodities eran más altos. El dinero extra se invirtió en clientelismo y no en educar a la gente. Se dieron pescados y no se enseñó a pescar.
40 2018-12-14 23:32:13 Stopped holocaust? The only reason you stopped supplying the Reich with commodities was it broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact & attacked you you lying cnuts! And as for the Polish nation, murdering 20000 of it's finest at #Katyn & occupying it until 1990 isn't "saving".

CNUTS!!!
41 2018-12-14 23:27:46 doubt it if the USD keeps on climbing. Other way may be. No body wants to touch commodities with China falling like it is...maybe some agricultural comms will do better.
42 2018-12-14 23:27:11 3rd parties see these as commodities and buy the tix up and wait for the demand to dictate price. The artist doesn’t (ethically) get any more than face value split and the buyer ends up paying a huge multiple.
43 2018-12-14 23:10:35 @WillCainShow you try to justify White Supremacy by drawing parallels with Michael Jordan, who is an ICON; playful act with one of his players, that has a relationship/idolization of him, to racist White Team CEO’s who treat players like “commodities”, not people; GTFOHWTBS
44 2018-12-14 22:54:59 Ella sola se refuta, esa "reducción" de pobreza no fue por mayor productividad, fue por gasto público que cuando cayeron los precios de las commodities no pudieron mantener.

Vaya éxito.

51 2018-12-14 21:55:42 I laugh when we hype food shortage in Nigeria. Are these not commodities produced and distributed in Nigeria? There are more fundamental issues about Nigerian than just changing government.
