0 2018-02-28 23:59:53 Can anyone help with knowledge of any crypto friendly banks in the United States? I now am also being charged .90 cents per debit card transaction ( which is insane seeing that's my cash ) by Bank of America. I am also no longer using my credit cards for the outrageous fees.

2 2018-02-28 23:59:33 My main concern with crypto and cashless society is the possibility of total control, the ability to freeze, delete accounts or shut down the system completely. A national or global citizens debit card would be a nightmare!
3 2018-02-28 23:59:13 That’s just a risk I’m willing to take. 

I will become one with the poasts

5 2018-02-28 23:59:02 Awwwhhh.. I used to watch that growing up! Huge fan, even still..lol.. I heard about dragonball super, maybe I'll give it a watch seeing as the infamous cryptolinda has now mentioned it

7 2018-02-28 23:58:48 We are unsure which service was compromised, but we do know that whoever got the data used it to log into a large number of accounts and attempted to withdraw the funds inside those accounts.

Please use 2-Factor everywhere.
8 2018-02-28 23:58:46 I hope crypto is the 60 and 70.
9 2018-02-28 23:58:43 What took so long? Some crypto guy told me he did that last night!

13 2018-02-28 23:58:10 This *is* from us. We sent it through Intercom, which helps us format and track receipts of emails. There were a number of accounts accessed this morning by a malicious party who appears to have been iterating through a stolen list from a password dump elsewhere.
