66 2018-04-08 23:16:02 There is an argument that less stocks lowers risk i.e. watch the basket more closely and higher quality stocks.  A reasonable rule is for no more than 10% or 15% in one stock.  You need to allow leeway for share price growth before this level is hit so say 20 or more stocks.
67 2018-04-08 23:15:11 First, the AR is not the issue. I'm ok with bump stocks being banned. But look at the numbers, knife attacks are surprisingly effective. 33 dead 130 injured (multiple attackers), 3 dead, 29 dead (single attacker), 8 dead et al. Data suggests people don't "rush" the attacker.

101 2018-04-08 22:36:05 Yes. I blew those two. Now I am on the hunt for new stocks.
102 2018-04-08 22:35:17 The AWB had absolutely no effect either way because it didn't actually ban anything.  Look it up on Wikipedia.  It just made it so you could only have 1 of: telescoping stocks, pistol grips, bayonet mount, flash suppressor. None of those make a gun more lethal.  Pointless.
103 2018-04-08 22:35:14 Oh, you mean solutions like, GROs, extended background checks, banning bump stocks, increasing funding for safe infrastructure and mental health, allowing responsible citizens to be trained to protect themselves, and prevention apps?
104 2018-04-08 22:32:58 Stocks?
105 2018-04-08 22:32:11 If even Warren Buffett picks stocks that have gone to zero (Dexter Shoes) we need to insulate ourselves from blowup risk.  Also the fewer stocks the more portfolio volatility and psychological biases.  Hard to sell a loser if it is 20% of the portfolio but easy if it is 4%.
106 2018-04-08 22:31:44 Look at the actual text of the ban. All guns and magazines that predated it were exempt. The ban got rid of bayonet lugs, folding or collapsible stocks and removable flash hiders. With a couple other minor changes.  Big deal.
107 2018-04-08 22:31:13 Like Offset wanting to sit down and hold conversations about today's political climate aaand stocks and bonds lmaooooo.

Nigga just cheating
108 2018-04-08 22:29:44 Obviously the downside with more stocks is that you reduce your return given that the quality of ideas is likely to decline.  So portfolio size is always a trade-off.  If you have only a few stocks it can be a good idea to also own a core position like a tracker or a fund.
109 2018-04-08 22:29:31 Unfortunately I doubt even ‘cheating’ season is likely to provide a boost to stocks
110 2018-04-08 22:27:47 I think you have to ask how many blowups you may get given your approach.  If you are generally able to avoid blowups you can have less stock.  You could have a core (say FTSE 250 tracker) and then say 5 stocks selected for a quarter of your portfolio.
111 2018-04-08 22:23:42 This is what cause stocks to be sold off. Good bye Facebook shares.  STOP alienating people. There nothing dangerous about them two.

115 2018-04-08 22:20:33 The NRA "Said" they supported banning Bump Stocks yet OPPOSED the Legislation. The AR15 is an Assault Weapon. It is USEFUL only as an anti-Human weapon.

117 2018-04-08 22:17:55 There is a difference between investing in stocks where I absolutely ageee long term is good. But bitcoin cannot become a currency as long as people hodl. It need to be used as a currency or it will disappear soon.
118 2018-04-08 22:17:51 free research #stocks #StockMarket
119 2018-04-08 22:17:43 Yes exactly.  More blowup risk in individual stocks means you need more holdings.  The issue is which stocks have the blowup risk.  Sectors have blowup risk so I agree that you need to diversify by sector.  The aim is for your portfolio to be able to preserve value.
120 2018-04-08 22:15:53 .@realDonaldTrump You wouldn't know a novel if it bit you in the ass.

You're manipulating stocks that will benefit you personally every time you bash a rival.

122 2018-04-08 22:13:18 The NRA supported the banning of bump stocks. You probably didn’t know that. Background checks already exist. But if your referring to medical history checks, then HIPAA laws must be changed first. And assault weapons don’t exist; that’s a made up term made to create fear.

125 2018-04-08 22:11:25 Correct on ff assumption. As previous claims of Assad using CW were proved to be. Jihadist 'rebels' are known to have CW, stocks left behind where they've been defeated. Voices of dissent r being shut down,censored,shadow banned. That in itself tells u what u need to know.
126 2018-04-08 22:10:37 Singed! 
127 2018-04-08 22:10:14 i pounded the table going into the 2008 crash with data & detail, now i dont even bother to warn much,, they didn't listen last time. (ps i gave a long rant at the bottom too,,, BEFORE obummer said to 'buy stocks')
128 2018-04-08 22:09:48 Weed stocks? Please say you’re joking
129 2018-04-08 22:09:17 That's impressive considering you only 2 stocks on for glory.
130 2018-04-08 22:08:56 100% but that’s the name of the game friend. Penny stocks are very unpredictable but everyone thinks they can predict when or if one will hit lol
131 2018-04-08 22:08:50 Probably it would be best rephrased as high quality sectors/companies you can have say 15-20.  Over 20 is typically seen as creating resilience.  When investing in stocks at risk of blowups (often smaller companies) I would go for over 30 - one blowup loses circa 3.33%.
132 2018-04-08 22:08:37 When you ask george hyden to take breakfast stocks back and at 11 youve still got eggs out
133 2018-04-08 22:08:12 Stocks will retest their correction lows as easy money disappears, 

a Wall Street bear warns 

“broad money,” which isn’t just physical money and includes any money  held in easily accessible accounts, is about $90.4 trillion.

150 2018-04-08 21:54:51 I figured it may be interpreted that way, but I try to keep my online presence as PG-rated as possible, hence the explanation.  
151 2018-04-08 21:54:48 Battlebus - The issue for individual stocks is unanticipated blow-up risk.  Larger companies are less exposed so you can have say 20.  Smaller companies are more exposed so I would say 30 or more.  If you own very resilient companies you could have only 15 i.e Unilever.
152 2018-04-08 21:53:50 In the parlance of the times, there were no bump stocks, automatic or semi automatic weapons. Also, They were meant specifically for those in militia.  Last time I checked, the majority of gun owners don’t belong to a militia. Things change

160 2018-04-08 21:45:31 LW: The ban of bump stocks has received final approval in the state of Maryland. Gov. Hogan says he will sign bill. -->
161 2018-04-08 21:41:32 Example of SPREADS, ~ taking EUR/USD $USD = 1 pip 10,000 units

typical cost 1.2 pips each way, now 7.4 pips or 

$7.40 on a round trip, buying $12,280 w/ $245 margin

about 3% to trade, others higher up to 10% juice.

USA stocks SPREAD is pennies per 100 round.

$DAX is 25 euros

The 2018 maize harvest is estimated at 3.0 million tons, their annual consumption is 3.5 million tons. There's also bits of stocks from the previous year

166 2018-04-08 21:36:33 Agree/ disagree in part. Govts can & should both incentivize affordable rentals & protect existing rental stocks b/c they are desperately needed & not everyone can or wants to own. At same time, eroding /decimating hsg stock for local residents who want to buy ≠ solution
167 2018-04-08 21:34:10 Les rebelles de Douma dialoguant pour partir et laisser leur armes lourdes, ils ont fait exploser leurs stocks de munitions et autres produits pas licites du tout, aussi, comme à Khan Sheikoun qui ne nous dit pas que ce sont leurs stocks détruits qui ont produits ce gaz ,
168 2018-04-08 21:33:37 Everyone already has to have a background check to buy a gun. Bump stocks are now banned by the feds.
169 2018-04-08 21:33:17 Where is China going to invest all of their dumped bonds/stocks. Japan?
170 2018-04-08 21:32:04 Les rebelles de Jaish al Islam de Douma étaient en train de dialoguer avec l'armée Syrienne, pour évacuer la zone, et laisser leur armement lourd, quel peut être l'intérêt des Syriens de leur balancer du gaz ? par contre les stocks chimiques des barbus explosant , là c'est gênant
171 2018-04-08 21:31:31 ETFs trade on a stock exchange and can be purchased and sold in a manner similar to stocks. Buying one share of the U.S. Oil Fund (USO) would give you exposure to roughly one barrel of oil. No cap.

188 2018-04-08 21:13:52 Instead of taking 1000 shares of a $3 stock, you take 100 shares of a $30 stock. $3 stock give you 20 cents profit/share, $30 stocks 2$/share. You make $200 in both stocks, BUT you risk SO much less in the $30 stock......

193 2018-04-08 21:07:16 If you would stay off the damn golf course and listen to your advisors the US would not be in the shit shape it is.  Stocks, crashing, stores closing, jobs going overseas.  You are a complete failure.
194 2018-04-08 21:06:58 And speculation in ETFs which cover these stocks will drive down the market.
195 2018-04-08 21:06:35 that's more stocks than a lot of other people
196 2018-04-08 21:06:18 In 1929 stocks crashed. Smoot-Hawley act raised tariffs on tens of thousands of products, 1934, global trade had tanked by 66% from 1929 levels. Markets had reacted before the act. @yasmeen_9 @setholdmixon @javeednusrat Only the world war took USA out of depression

203 2018-04-08 21:00:41 Which stocks have the top mutual fund managers been buying recently?
204 2018-04-08 20:59:20 So I've been fiddling around a tad with stocks lately, and I'm actually enjoying it. It's nice to step into something new and unfamiliar and make a few bucks on the side.
205 2018-04-08 20:59:20 Mike Fiers really blew out my expectations, thought it was gonna all implode when he loaded the bases in the first so good for him. Alex Wilson, Joe Jiminez, and Shane Greene stocks all rose. Leonys Martin was the whole offense, solid hits and clutch base running, very good win..
206 2018-04-08 20:59:13 Invest in popcorn stocks.
207 2018-04-08 20:58:43 The new version of Google Finance is no good. it does not give you the option to create a profile for Seg and/or Mutual funds. Only good to follow some top stocks. The old version was much better than this new one. It says, "your Stocks" only.
208 2018-04-08 20:57:38 Musk does not exploit people in the area of payment. All Tesla employees are well paid, and get stocks on top of their wage. That part is fine.

The problem is that Musk has very aggressive expectations about performance, too much OT, that sort of thing. Ordinarily,....
209 2018-04-08 20:56:31 I fully embrace the socks n stocks look, but the second you wanna put socks with any other sandal, I am gone.
210 2018-04-08 20:56:17 How you know Assad did this? Do you have numerous stocks in gas,oil and defence?   Maybe that's why you know. War rises oil prices. Were not all stupid. Please tell me i'm wrong and you own no stocks.
211 2018-04-08 20:54:43 How much money do you need to retire ? I need about a billion in gold and 100 million liquid cash USD with about $10 million in stocks bonds and real estate.
212 2018-04-08 20:54:07 No penny stocks. All large cap stocks. No halt risk, max risk, large % returns
213 2018-04-08 20:53:49 @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain but wait for @SenJohnMcCain to highly invest in wartime stocks.
214 2018-04-08 20:53:43 How much money have you and your cronies made with the tariff talk. Am sure you have been coached to do this so you and they can make billions buying and selling stocks short. You are despicable and pity our poor wife and son for having to live with you.
215 2018-04-08 20:52:15 Yes. They have. Both the JIM and the OPCW have both pointed to Assad as the primary user of CW in Syria. This isn’t even up for debate.

I’m sure all those robust stocks of CW that Assad admitted to when he joined the CWC just sat idle, right? He kept them as museum pieces?
216 2018-04-08 20:51:30 The EU has worked tirelessly (not always perfectly) to ensure the sustainability of the fishing industry of its member nations, & fish stocks more widely.

222 2018-04-08 20:41:48 Perhaps legislation should be put forth and we would see what #SCOTUS says. Rightly or wrongly it seems they hold the final verdict on everything. By the way @POTUS mentioned bump stocks and loopholes once in the debate and told Congress to get to work. It lies with them.
223 2018-04-08 20:41:24 Dont belive the gurus who say it is your own fault that you can't trade theese stocks. Off course they say that, they want their custumers for life....
224 2018-04-08 20:41:03 In #stocks, #GoingShort involves #borrowing #shares of stock from your broker or someone so you can sell high and then buy low, returning shares to the #lender. In #futures, going short means you’re trying to profit as a result of falling #contract #prices. No borrowing.
225 2018-04-08 20:40:31 Meh, haven't done much either. All I did was taking 7 stocks in a little fun 4v4 CB buuuuuut that's pretty much all I did for today. I need to do something else tbh

228 2018-04-08 20:39:50 It’s the semi automatic knives with bump stocks that cause the problem!
229 2018-04-08 20:39:36 When you are jailed/executed for disagreeing with a policy. When you are controlled and brainwashed by state-run media (ONLY). When you see real oppression all around you and realize that you're trapped inside of it. All you care about is surviving. Bump stocks FFS. Poor you.
230 2018-04-08 20:38:09 i need some stocks
231 2018-04-08 20:38:00 We can still make ownership a felony and offer a grace period for turning the bump stocks in.

235 2018-04-08 20:35:51 So you’re saying that right is unlimited in terms of sheer number & magnitude of firepower? 

Or perhaps we need limits, like there are w/ the 1st amendment (e.g. laws against hate speech or direct calls for violence)? 

Again, why is #potus talking abt bump stocks & loopholes?
236 2018-04-08 20:35:49 Missing the main point. Hundreds of thousands of bump stocks, and one was used in a mass shooting. A non-issue.
237 2018-04-08 20:32:57 I fail to understand the mentality of people who would rush out to buy items like bump stocks whose only purpose is to make a weapon more efficient at killing people… Maybe they should amend the 2nd amendment, then you can start your own civil war… again…
238 2018-04-08 20:32:48 Bump stocks don’t need to be banned . People with Mental disabilities need to be kept from owning weapons .. and no 1 person should be allowed to sell guns without a license . NOBODY
239 2018-04-08 20:32:10 Well, I have no interest in paying taxes but if it’s the law, you do it or face the consequences. Facts show that most Americans favor the ban of bump stocks and at least for now this is still a democracy.
240 2018-04-08 20:31:50 @Stocks_68 On behalf of @Kidney_Research Thank you for all the Goals, Assists and.......Penalties this season.
241 2018-04-08 20:30:58 Please. Y do u need bump stocks to defend yourself? My God have you ever lived in another country? (not served, but lived). You REALLY haven't the slightest clue how lucky/good u have it. U crying about bump stocks is a reflection of your privilege.  Tyranny?  you are misguided
242 2018-04-08 20:26:20 Or stocks he bought in companies from the region when he thought Hillary was going to be President and sign TPP. Either way it’s always about enriching themselves.
243 2018-04-08 20:21:47 As for bump stocks I could care less but honestly what good would that do. They've been used in one shooting. They're honestly obscure and very few are on the streets anyway but to hear libs everyone with an AR-15 has one.
244 2018-04-08 20:21:35 OK. Take the fisheries policy. The EU   one has very major problems, agreed, but we need to preserve fish stocks and catches are not species specific. What is your proposal for a better policy?
245 2018-04-08 20:21:04 He was screaming solid buy at 35c. Look at where those holders are now. My trades are open in these circles and I daily offer my opinion on stocks to trade or not to trade. If I could get borrow on AVZ when I sold I would have shorted it with every cent I had. Would have made $$
246 2018-04-08 20:20:28 So are you saying there are no loopholes? Or not any worth focusing attention on?

#potus said he wanted to focus #gunreform on registration loopholes & bump stocks. What is he referring to then? 

Seems like both sides say/believe things w/ #bias. 
247 2018-04-08 20:20:02 Didn’t @DSjuggerud call buy Chinese stocks when $ASHR was ~ $24? Subs enjoyed huge gains. 
He says now is perfect buy opportunity for Chinese stocks. Basically coined phrase “melt - up” years ago, predicted this last melt up in late Jan. to ath, so his track record is impressive.
248 2018-04-08 20:16:57 What you’re paying is for tax cuts for the wealthy. You are paying to make sure billionaires can buy more stocks. That doesn’t bother you though, right? It’s just the idea of helping people who actually made guy need it through no fault of their own. Got it.
249 2018-04-08 20:15:45 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
250 2018-04-08 20:13:53 Thanks for proving your inability to comprehend written English. Also, keep supporting a party that endorsed a child molester for Alabama Senate, stocks the white house with wife beaters, champions white supremacists and pollutes the environment. #welldone! #fakenurse
251 2018-04-08 20:12:15 @KateRaworth Dear kate, im making a film about the sustainable reinvestment of my inherited portfolio, stocks in shell and mcdonalds, I was wondering if you could give any advice on how to invest in a doughnut sort of way? Is this possible in this unsustainable financial system?

Lots of what the average believes to be true isn’t applicable to #financialmarkets. E.g. Stocks may climb when people lose jobs, because #unemployment may lead to lower #InterestRates.

260 2018-04-08 20:08:03 @nroberts98 worried about you. Hope all is ok. Miss your excellent comments on preferred stocks
261 2018-04-08 20:04:52 Same reason ppl buy stocks, gold and index funds. Economists should go jump into a lake.  No company gives dividends anymore... stock price is the only game in town.  Forks are divideds in crypto 
262 2018-04-08 20:03:10 I don’t claim to know everything.   I think the problem with Univ background is the national registry it would require. I could be wrong, but I think that’s their beef with it. The NRA is actually ok with banning bump stocks.  The onus is on those trying to take away a right

274 2018-04-08 19:55:03 That's what they said about the ban on machine guns in the 30's. Once a few people were sent to Leavenworth, everyone else got the message. It'll be the same with bump stocks.
275 2018-04-08 19:53:58 What we want gun reform to look like:

1)ban domestic and animal abusers from buying guns
2)ban private sale of guns
3)raise purchase age to 21
4)gun registration data base
5)allow CDC to research gun violence
6)ban military grade weapons
7)ban bump stocks

276 2018-04-08 19:53:18 yes ! .. the idea of most stocks recommended is to rarely have to sell ... if i earn > deposit rate .. am happy ... bcoz other stocks cd be doing well .. !

278 2018-04-08 19:53:09 Facebook grew fast from a great idea. Mark rode the wave and grew too fast. Allowed bad actors to influence him, but selling off stocks secretly, deleting emails...Mark, don't be a TRUMP, your daughter's deserve better! GOP should act to punish russia but can't, hurts TRUMP
279 2018-04-08 19:52:54 Trumps not stupid. China may throw a tantrum but in the end it will be a better deal for us.  Of course stocks will drop, but they will go back up.

283 2018-04-08 19:48:09 "The Rolling Stones' 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' was a staple cut played over the end of Trump rallies during his campaign. Red-state believers who paid no attention then may get another chance to pay soon enough. Investors ditched agriculture-linked stocks"
284 2018-04-08 19:48:02 STOCKS/EARNINGS REPORTS:  This week we see how companies did after Trumps/Republicans tax cuts to billionaires.  Projections are for an 18% increase in earnings in 2018 because  we spent our big take-home pay bumps & bonuses.  And China likes us.
@TheDemCoalition @TheDemocrats
285 2018-04-08 19:47:51 No they are not.  But bump stocks purchased while they were legal cannot later be seized by the gov’t without compensation.  It’s the same reason you get paid for your land if taken for road widening
286 2018-04-08 19:46:42 Yes I cried. In other news, water is wet
287 2018-04-08 19:46:33 Yes. Not saying that there aren’t obvious risks but doesn’t discount that if you put in the work, there are many stocks not under major distribution selling and still have great looking charts.
288 2018-04-08 19:46:25 Important to find the balance then between interference, inconvenience & safety.

As I understand it, irresponsible gun owners can sometimes get guns w/o registering at a gun show or online. If true, shouldn’t those loopholes be eliminated?
#potus also said no bump stocks 
Agree?
289 2018-04-08 19:46:11 Even though the whole asset class is still quite small, I'd say it's getting more correlated due to the recent ICO mania bc businesses have to pay bills. If stocks are in risk off mode, it could be less friendly for the owners of new businesses if nowhere else psychologically.

296 2018-04-08 19:40:39 I'll do you one better: here's a video of an amazingly beautiful woman (who is for the first time firing an AR-15 with bump stocks in her life) a self-proclaimed "bump stock virgin" and look at the sustainability/precision/accuracy of this novice citizen with no military training
297 2018-04-08 19:39:30 I haven't decided yet to let go or not pennystocks ;) and move toward BIG CAP stocks. I kind wanna try the both worlds at the same time...
298 2018-04-08 19:39:25 I can't prove it, but for real you're pushing for war more than anyone else on twitter or MSM or even fox. Why? Again how many stocks you own in gas and or oil?
299 2018-04-08 19:39:14 He's definitely clutch. I've beaten him a couple times before, though, and I'm usually good in clutch situations.

I definitely need to close some opportunities for early stocks, but I also don't think it's super reasonable to plan on avoiding clutch situations.
300 2018-04-08 19:38:31 Got to start somewhere! I think most gun owners are law abiding citizens. Probably fun to play with, but the bump stocks have too much dangerous potential when used by a maniac. Bump stocks are just a method to try to circumvent restrictions on auto weapons.
301 2018-04-08 19:37:30 This is buying opportunity for Chinese stocks. Look back 1 month from now you’ll see . . .
302 2018-04-08 19:36:10 Finding quite a few stocks this weekend that have constructive setups that I’m adding to my watchlist. There are a handful of stocks bucking the broad market selling which are catching my eye. Can’t just assume b/c the Dow & SPX are down that all stocks are weak as well.
303 2018-04-08 19:35:35 Stan, the problem with this show is people phone in about the same stocks on every show
304 2018-04-08 19:34:10 Gaslighting points. Russia uncovered AQ/IS chorine stocks & labs throughout Syria, that's why they warned a month ago. And soldiers have CBRN protection, CW is useless in mil-mil warfare. Good for false flags b/c CW is "special" & gets reaction, unlike snipers.
305 2018-04-08 19:34:00 I’m happy to admit I welled up

307 2018-04-08 19:33:26 STOCKS & MIDTERM ELECTIONS:  Stocks are very risky due to MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICITS, trade wars, Trump/Mueller, Social media regs.

310 2018-04-08 19:32:02 There's a actually a simple way to address this. Everyone's favorite enforcement mechanism: Taxes. 

Tax bump stocks in a recurring yearly level. Like buying a license plate sticker. Funds from the tax can only be used to set up buy back programs.

314 2018-04-08 19:28:49 It's not a surefire way of making/not losing money, but it's pretty safe and very low effort. That's what I do too. 20% bonds, 40% US stocks, 40% international stock.
315 2018-04-08 19:28:23 Twitter is a lot of fun. But it can get you into trouble by blindly following a coin someone shills. When I started attempting to trade biotech stocks when I was 19 I followed twitter traders. I made some money but ultimately got rekt. $DYoR
316 2018-04-08 19:27:46 A bump stock by virtue of its mechanics causes inaccurate fire. But, the Second Amendment wasn't written to protect hunters. Bump Stocks would serve a useful purpose when it comes to a Civil War against Radical Leftist Communists who want to do away with the Constitution.

339 2018-04-08 18:56:59 The Second Amendment never said I didn't say nothing about background checks bump stocks High round magazines or War weapons of mass destruction and that's what an AR-15 is a War weapon no one outside the military needs one it has one purpose only killing people
340 2018-04-08 18:56:34 it's more about the washington post which @JeffBezos owns than anything else which is why @realDonaldTrump attacks amazon. Or maybe driving markets down allows Trumps family's company to buy stocks at lower prices.

342 2018-04-08 18:54:22 The question isn't, are they willing to surrender bump stocks, it's are they more willing to risk prison than to surrender bump stocks?

344 2018-04-08 18:53:21 What a plug! 
345 2018-04-08 18:53:09 You honestly do not know what your talking about!  Banning bum stocks are not going to stop mentally flawed individuals from killing.  Nor banning what you call assault weapons!  “Assualt weapon” is a word made up by liberals to make weapons they don’t like sound more dangerous.

348 2018-04-08 18:48:20 I'm talking federal laws. And I'm talking background checks that require waiting periods for each gun. And an increase age. And of course background checks that screen for mental health. Bump stocks need to not be manufactured anymore. At all.
349 2018-04-08 18:48:10 If you are a cop, you find some yahoo with one on his rifle, you seize the rifle and arrest the owner for possession of an illegal fire arm.  Word will get around and the bump stocks will disappear into peoples closets.

359 2018-04-08 18:45:34 The pressure on the housing market for me is the primary reason for the electoral anger and what I still consider the protest vote that resulted in the leave vote in 2016. Housing costs soaring and stocks of affordable homes dwindling feed directly into immigration debate,

374 2018-04-08 18:36:18 Just came across an interesting question on twitter which asked stocks u'd own if markets were to close for next 10 years.

In my views :
PAGE IND
ASIAN PAINTS
MRF
MARUTI
ITC
V GUARD/AMARA RAJA 

wud be my best bets, but only if the valuations are atractive.
375 2018-04-08 18:35:44 2a has never been repealed, nor will it ever be ..regulations will happen and Trump has even put a ban on bump stocks ...but we will not hand over the iron throne to you and abolish 2A
376 2018-04-08 18:34:14 Yes ! On a ça aussi dans fusion, mais ça fait des stocks trop lourd et l'impression est plus lente aussi . Du coup quand c'est pas trop important , je réduit la qualité. Ça explique la facturation ( et le ponçage aussi ;-) )

379 2018-04-08 18:32:15 I don't create policy but I don't believe that guns should be taken away completely. Ive owned them, shot them, like them etc. But what is happening now isnt working. Background checks are virtually nothing and need to be examined. Bump stocks etc should be banned

390 2018-04-08 18:27:56 FRIP was the option of pooling all dividends and allocating them in any percentage monthly to any five stocks for free.  It was a fantastic way to balance your portfolio (ie larger paying positions could build smaller or new ones). Otherwise with DRIP big just got bigger.

416 2018-04-08 17:55:28 Hat's off to @TedNugent for telling us how he really feels: He wants to shoot Americans!

Just a guess, but I'm assuming with assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.

BTW Ted, think your pal Stephen Paddock shared your sentiments.
417 2018-04-08 17:55:25 Way too simplistic. You are a wise man on oil stocks Dan but you need to wake up on Russia and see the connection between demonisation of Russia and attacks on Corbyn. All part of same program.
418 2018-04-08 17:54:49 But don’t say stocks have been volatile. Last volatility was 2011.

423 2018-04-08 17:48:26 I think the shooter didn’t use a shooting platform as he didn’t use any bipods:

• all AR15 (1,050 shots) had bump stocks, NONE had bipods

• all AR10 except Ruger Am had bipods BUT all AR10 shots came from 134. There’s no room for an AR10 on a bipod between bed & window in 134

426 2018-04-08 17:46:35 True but the increase would work look a 401k where similarly you see the asset grow over time w contributions (impacted by pay level of job) and 'return' (return of stocks for 401k or accretion of the discount for social security)

430 2018-04-08 17:37:33 If we want our drama schools to take talent rather than grades, we do need to think how those auditions are funded - they cost money to run: admin/panellists/building costs. Where could the money come from? (Fee waivers and travel expenses are already available btw)

I don't advise to invest in F&O. 
It's better to stick with fundamentally strong stocks.
432 2018-04-08 17:36:27 In Sweden the Police is lobbying against rifles with "removable stocks" (which all normal rifles have) as they "makes it possible to fire from the hip" (most rifles cannot be fired at all with the stock removed from the action)
433 2018-04-08 17:33:14 Can anyone tell me how to short stocks? There are a few companies I want to bet against.

436 2018-04-08 17:31:51 “Banning rapid firing rifles, and certain powerful firearms and bump stocks, which increase a rifles’ rate of fire”....so what do U class as ‘rapid fire’ and ‘powerful firearms’ ? or is that open to Interpretation? basically penalising responsible gun owners...AGAIN
437 2018-04-08 17:30:36 Just checked. If you apply to do drama at a uni, you pay £24 with no guarantee of even an interview if your grades are not high enough. A vocational drama school audition fee gets you an audition whatever your academic level.

455 2018-04-08 17:16:49 I sadly agree, which is why I transferred my small cap stocks for global market stocks mid January, before the sell off. 
They have not recovered yet.
All because of a tweet.
456 2018-04-08 17:12:37 No one ever said it was. The declared stockpile was removed. The focus now should be on how we work with partners to deal with undeclared stocks and the continued use of chlorine.
457 2018-04-08 17:12:11 I'm guessing Richard doesn't own a bunch of oil and gas stocks. Maybe @realDonaldTrump is in on it all along, because i don't think he's naive and stupid.

464 2018-04-08 17:06:51 Refer to the other message about bump stocks. They should be banned not outlawed
465 2018-04-08 17:06:26 Can you get me a deal on, say, 30,000 AR-15's or just maybe a few bump stocks? I hear you quite like a deal.
466 2018-04-08 17:06:07 If people stopped making bump stocks then it would solve the problem for the most part. Yes, people could still try to make one or whatever but they wouldnt be so readily available
467 2018-04-08 17:05:05 There is also a fee to apply to university through UCAS - currently £24, with a limit on 5 applications. The recall system at most drama schools means a successful first round candidate gets much more than just an interview though. And the fee includes recalls.
468 2018-04-08 17:03:22 Eh. Stocks???

470 2018-04-08 17:02:01 So @XiaomiIndia retail outlets is basically a scam. You won't be able to get latest series phone/TV at the outlet coz Management at the outlet have nexus with local retailers and they inform/hold back stocks for their sub-retailers and get commission on it. 1/n

472 2018-04-08 17:00:43 Facebook, Google & Amazon are all conducting business that now skirts outside the law, requiring new federal regulations. But don’t bet on it, from both sides of the aisle. These three along with MS & Intel is 30% of the market cap value of all 3200 stocks traded on NASDAQ

480 2018-04-08 16:55:34 I get that. Arming ourselves with weapons against police. Especially in certain areas where cops abuse their power more. But I believe that as guns evolve, so should the laws. Just like how automatic weapons were outlawed at some point. (Bump stocks are dumb and should be illegal

485 2018-04-08 16:48:22 It has nothing to do with the law abiding citizens that follow the laws of being a gun owner. Now do we need an AR or any other asult riffle no. Ban the bump stocks too.

516 2018-04-08 16:32:13 What good? Stocks are in freefall because of his tariffs.  He isn't trying to help America with the tariffs.  He wants the stocks to fall so his billionaire friends can buy them for cheap.  He's destroying the environment. Etc.... Idiot Trumptard.
517 2018-04-08 16:31:12 I don't think you guys understand the stock market. It fluctuates. Goes up and down. It's down right now but in 2-3 months it's gonna be back up. There are only 2 ways to lose money in said stock market. 1. Make bad investments 2. Buy stocks when they are high and sell when low

525 2018-04-08 16:25:08 @smerconish just curious of your opinion.... is trump running stocks down so he and his friends can buy cheap and then ease off the tariffs and sell high therefore making billions? #CORRUPTION
526 2018-04-08 16:25:05 1) Syria is known to have possessed chemical weapons stocks while the armed groups have never been proven to.

2) If the armed groups do possess chemical weapons why do they keep using them against themselves?

3) Trump will only launch a token retaliatory strike like last year.
527 2018-04-08 16:24:26 Donc, si je comprends bien, la #Syrie (et les Russes) qui vient de reprendre la #Ghouta serait assez conne pour faire péter du chimique maintenant . Ca n'a interpellé personne que les stocks détenus par les gentils "rebelles" ont pu exploser quel qu'en soit le mécanisme.

Anyone else think it's possible that Trump started this trade war , slams private companies so stocks tumble , then has people buy stock low and then recants and sales when the stocks rise.
He would make billions. I can't be the only one who thinks this.

592 2018-04-08 15:39:20 With Icahn’s corrupt use of insider knowledge (regulations), is it possible that Trump is doing a similar move with #Amazon, etc. ?Waiting for its stocks to go and cronies to come in to buy low?

Trump's idea of "winning".
617 2018-04-08 15:17:46 Pretty sure that the best time to buy stock in a company is right after Trump trashes them and their stocks take a hit. You're bound to make a killing when they go back up.

636 2018-04-08 15:00:51 Why did the rebels have stocks of Chlorine gas and children in their bunkers? 

Assad offered to let the civilians leave (many, in fact, did) but the rebels dug in, so Assad bombed them to avoid causalities on his own side (he's very short of soldiers and uses young conscripts)

641 2018-04-08 14:57:00 Hey Gopal, thank you for all the information that you share regarding stocks market. You are helping me to be rich. 
Thank you so much 
642 2018-04-08 14:56:27 Come on @realDonaldTrump, be a pal and give me a day's lead on your  tweets,  I want to short some stocks.

Especially stocks of businesses that make goods in China and sell to the US consumers. 

Please?
643 2018-04-08 14:56:11 Strikes me that everything Biff does is to make him and his family more money. Announce import tariffs, DOW falls, buy stocks, row back on import tariffs, DOW rises, sell stocks.
644 2018-04-08 14:56:07 Trade war doesn't affect it at all unless people get pissed off and bury their money on stocks.
645 2018-04-08 14:54:49 Hello and welcome, please feel free to msg me some stocks for graphic design.

649 2018-04-08 14:52:10 Many Britons have forgotten the two cod wars and British fish stocks have shrunk by 94% (in 120 years!, report 2010). Excessive fishing was curbed by catch quotas and stocks were able to recover somewhat. The over fishing of some fish stocks is still a danger!

651 2018-04-08 14:50:13 These tariffs certainly are helping Trump’s friends. Carl Icahn, friend of Trump, sold $30 million in stocks of a steel company weeks BEFORE Trump announced 25% tariff on steel. Coincidence?
652 2018-04-08 14:50:10 This proves your tarriff attack is all to do with making yourself millions. Stock market crashes, you buy stocks, don't follow through, stocks rise again.
653 2018-04-08 14:49:44 Thx for reply. I guess the whole monthly benefit also sounds more motivating for an investment :) 
Any good suggestions for some first stocks with monthly dividend? Got a great eye on Boston Pizza..
654 2018-04-08 14:46:32 I don't follow either, but they were highlighted by others, and both $LFIN and $RAD look awful.  LFIN of course appears very dubious... and is currently suspended. I'm not aware of the other 'blockchain' hysteria stocks, maybe some suggestions?
655 2018-04-08 14:46:12 The problem is that the current interest rate environment punishes traditional business models in banking (deposit taking and lending) and rewards risky/speculative activities (betting on increasing prices of real estate, stocks/bonds etc.)

662 2018-04-08 14:44:37 These same crypto traders (again not the HODL crowd), will also come to realize the huge risks crypto has vs if they traded stocks. Where on low float movers they can get same daily profit gains in stocks with much less risk. (as a footnote - I trade only 5% of my acct in crypto)
663 2018-04-08 14:44:03 Right, still would’ve been better though.
664 2018-04-08 14:43:16 Also, she’s totally wrong - we put things in our bodies to make other people happy all the time.

673 2018-04-08 14:37:19 Without a comprehensive post- #Brexit fishing policy with the EU, the UK might well be restricted to fishing the already-depleted fishing stocks of 'British Waters'. A joint UK-EU agreement guaranteeing reciprical rights for fishermen in both jurisdictions is required.
674 2018-04-08 14:35:58 The world thinks Trump is nothing more than Putin’s puppet and an embarrassment to the United States. I live in a foreign country and the view is Trump and his policies are a joke. Tourism, stocks, imports & exports are all down because of him.
675 2018-04-08 14:35:21 Using his power to intentionally influence a company's stock value and then buy the same stocks is unethical and is basically insider trading. Trump is not above the law and this, if it could be proven, would be his demise.

681 2018-04-08 14:29:01 6.  Why would Russia use novichok on a retired spy they could have killed years ago. 7.  Why would Russia let the world know they have illegal stocks of novichok if they weren’t going after a major player.  8.  What is skripal’s affiliation with Cambridge analytica
682 2018-04-08 14:28:44 Yup! Investors are on top of it. And they’re watching who knows how many companies/stocks. You would think a well ran company would be on top of that.
683 2018-04-08 14:26:50 1. How did Russia keep their stocks of novichok secret from opcw.  2.  How did it get into uk.  3.  Who administered it.  4.  Why hasn’t it killed anyone as it’s 10 x more powerful than VX.  5.  Why would Russia use it now with World Cup.
684 2018-04-08 14:25:53 So if you think so . You need to buy stocks with your last kr. interesting that CF and inside don't think so. No one analyst think so. No one big fonder buying. Blankarna go more in.
685 2018-04-08 14:25:46 From the school gun club I observed- this is true, but students did not use assault style weapons. They did not have extended magazines or bump stocks at their events. Common sense gun reform won’t interfere.
686 2018-04-08 14:25:37 my take on it. Trump has gotten  unemployment down for everyone in just 1 yr. salaries are rising first time in over 20 yrs. Stocks are at their strongest ever. Jobs coming back from overseas. And all done by a guy who didn't have a chance to win. I wouldn't bet against him.

690 2018-04-08 14:21:03 1300 metric tons of declared chemical weapons and precursors were removed. That amount is enough to kill pretty much every human in the region. US was always concerned about undeclared stocks & continues to work with partners to deal with that problem. Russia has obstructed.

704 2018-04-08 14:10:43 Would wager the Trump family and friends are shorting stocks and commodities affected by these tariffs. DT appears be trying to drive the market down.

710 2018-04-08 14:05:09 @skynews #Syrian gas attacks were faked by Jihadis. Assad verifiably destroyed all his stocks of gas. Israeli influence in western media ensures these fake reports are covered widely, but they’re still LIES.
711 2018-04-08 14:04:42 I’m fairly certain there’s going to be a run on cold medicine stocks based solely on my own recent consumption.
712 2018-04-08 14:03:36 No one is saying that cops will need to collect guns. That myth only whips up discord. Proposals: ban bump stocks/assault rifles, expand b/g checks. Arguing laws shouldn’t be tightened because criminals ignore laws illogical-if that the case, there’d be no laws at all!
713 2018-04-08 14:03:06 That would have been another mistake. Israel is the troublemaker in the area and Assad gave up his gas stocks. His Jihadi enemies keep faking these reports. Wake up!

716 2018-04-08 13:58:55 Momentum looks great on paper. In the real world? Not so much. Since 2009 in non-US stocks:

Int’l Large Value = +6.5%
Int’l Small Cap = +10.8%
Int’l Small Value = +10.4%

772 2018-04-08 13:13:49 Which junk stocks are u talking about .. ??
Out of 72 listed stocks of Pantomath.., only 3 are trading in discounts ...
Infact, most of the multibaggers in SMEs have been produced by Pantomath only ...

774 2018-04-08 13:12:04 Pay for the return of bump stocks or confiscate them.
775 2018-04-08 13:10:32 ... defence stocks are falling!!! ... quick ! Start another war......
776 2018-04-08 13:08:55 Josh was talking about his stock portfolio and how he wants to get into penny stocks and i called him the Wolf of Wall Street. Woke up this morning to him watching it....
777 2018-04-08 13:08:52 sinipag ako kanina linisin ang store namen. Hahaha. 
Pati mga stocks namen nilinis ko. Para wala ng masabe. 
778 2018-04-08 13:08:17 La rumeur de pénurie de croquettes pour chats provoque une rupture de stocks. Les consommateurs font des réserves.
779 2018-04-08 13:07:43 80% of gains come in 20% of time. So an investor needs enormous patience and conviction to hold stocks for 5 or 10 years to get multiple times profit.
780 2018-04-08 13:06:21 Already sold my stock in Facebook and Twitter.  Some funds still have both stocks, but these will be decreased as their value decrease.  The question - should conservatives still use Twitter and Facebook?  
781 2018-04-08 13:05:47 It’s not difficult because most common sense gun reform not limited by #2A. TRUE Universal background checks, no bump stocks, no high cap mags, ARs not protected by 2A. Current law crafted by gun industry so easy to restore common sense.

784 2018-04-08 13:04:51 Let’s hope it is an ebb & flow situation. Many #Biotech stocks plummeted Friday after poor clinical trial results of a combination #immunotherapy cancer treatment. @Incyte @Merck #keytruda #Melanoma
785 2018-04-08 13:03:31 See, that’s exactly why I said that the term PURE is very important. Even today, there are many #largecapfunds that invest 80% in largecap stocks and the remaining 20% is invested in mid-cap. They shall remain the same. But, I was referring to a 100 % large cap fund.
786 2018-04-08 13:02:57 Wait you have stocks ?
787 2018-04-08 13:01:13 @FBIWFO My friend mentioned in passing that perhaps tariffs are a way to drop stock values so certain folks can purchase stocks after values drop. Is this at all possible?
788 2018-04-08 13:00:04 Why don't you spend more time and energy finding out the details of the Vegas massacre instead of this nonsense. Bump stocks had nothing to do with this event. Complete diversion.
789 2018-04-08 13:00:01 .@ArlanFF101's Topics for this Months Webinar: #OATT

790 2018-04-08 12:59:42 Exactly, the stocks plummeted because of Trump. Ruin the economy to try to deflect from his legal problems.
791 2018-04-08 12:59:09 Small business got advance to keep  flow of stocks and payments without any problems
792 2018-04-08 12:58:36 Trading Tip #601: Investing in companies (stocks) for the long run is always a good idea, have to do your research on these companies, ask yourself will this company be around in 10 years time, understand their products and demand for it.

794 2018-04-08 12:57:15 Ohh I’m sure that a physco killer will really be dissuaded by a new law banning bump stocks from commmitting evil in the future
795 2018-04-08 12:56:36 It’s usually pretty straight forward, but gets complicated when there are stocks involved.
796 2018-04-08 12:56:02 Kerry's words were indeed unwise if not foolish (especially since but P5 knew in fact that it was not going to be 100%). JCPOA includes enforcement provisions, monitoring and deterrence, CW deal did not (and stocks easy to hide).
797 2018-04-08 12:55:16 For multibagger I prefer to try my luck in gambling. There I have a better chance as compared to stocks. Im Equity I am happy with market returns. 
798 2018-04-08 12:54:57 William O Neill's pärla How to make money in stocks öppnade upp ögonen för mig hur man överavkastar. Måste även nämna @kavastu , @Dax12000  & @Lou_Mannheim som jag snott lite ideér av

804 2018-04-08 12:47:50 The trade conflict with China could be particularly devastating to rural economies, especially for pig farmers, soybean & corn growers. Carmakers, Boeing, medical device & drug manufacturers could also be hit hard. Trump insists we are winning. Meanwhile on Wall Street stocks...
805 2018-04-08 12:46:15 Do you guys have stocks?
806 2018-04-08 12:45:19 Assad gasses his own people.  Helicopter crashes killing 2 US serviceman. Stocks are diving.  And your up yapping about the Washington  post and Hillary. What a narrow minded little person you are.
807 2018-04-08 12:45:13 I have a couple of stocks on my watchlist. Like Amazon. Stock is on a constant rise from like more than 2 years and it still has "buy" recommendation. Amazing. #stocks #Amazon #business

811 2018-04-08 12:33:53 rebound in stocks
812 2018-04-08 12:33:07 For 8 yes Obama was trashing the USA all I heard was look at stock market...nevertheless be it was fake QE was reason stocks market was high and 0 interest rates which mean economy sucks...yes please give us 8 more years of that 
813 2018-04-08 12:32:38 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
814 2018-04-08 12:31:31 This was a shrinking economy, with massive unemployment. It negatively affected collections. Nonetheless we hear about housing projects, hotels at BBridge etc.  Inability to pick performing stocks is their own baby. Fire the CIO.
815 2018-04-08 12:31:14 Sorry bud we agreed to disagree on$LG which is his wheelhouse (pot stocks). Six months ago he liked the company. First time I heard his view of $fat no matter, the NI results will give it a .
816 2018-04-08 12:30:54 The effects of Trump policies won’t have an effect for another year or more. The economy doesn’t move as fast as the stocks but we are already to job growth slowing down and even the market has started trending down. Maybe u don’t know much about the economy
817 2018-04-08 12:30:41 It is not a matter of if these bright crypto traders start trading stocks. It is only a matter of time before they see their TA skillet and computer trading programs can make them money in stocks. Especially against current stock traders still trading manually old methods.
818 2018-04-08 12:30:20 It's Sunday once again. Time to revisit your stocks portfolio and make trade plans for the week! #PHStockMarket #PinoyMoneyIQ

820 2018-04-08 12:29:16 They are forced to communicate movements at a certain quantity on stocks, not sure on crypto thought.
821 2018-04-08 12:27:43 The same is starting to happen with the smart crypto traders studying technical analysis and computerize a.i. trading. The old school stock traders, including pennystock traders are laughing at them. But quickly these crypto traders if they ever trade stocks will overtake them
822 2018-04-08 12:26:14 #maga U.S. job growth has hit a six-month low, according to just-released Labor Dept. data. Stocks are taking a triple-digit loss for the third day this week. Trumps a FKN disaster for America !

830 2018-04-08 12:20:17 Blame it on our partly self-inflicted stagnant economic growth as well (poor hardest hit). Rich folks are merely reaping the fruit of investing in stocks & shares abroad (global financial markets).
831 2018-04-08 12:18:33 which one to choose from two different prices in BSE and NSE stocks with a small difference?
832 2018-04-08 12:17:44 you're seriously delusional...if anything, you have set off a global bear market and ended the longest running up trend in stocks in history. But again you actually lost money running a casino.  poor guy...history will not be kind to you trumps
833 2018-04-08 12:17:24 Please explain how what the MSD kids are advocating for (background checks, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, civilian versions of military rifles) is a stripping of your rights under current Supreme Court doctrine (Heller, written by Antonin Scalia).

Hint: it isn't.

It has been suggested that certain classes of criminals, as part of their punishment, be displayed in glass cages in the local high street before being carted off to jail. A bit like stocks in medieval times. It's an awful idea. Don't let it happen.

859 2018-04-08 11:59:59 Knowledge is king: I disagree and agree with DG about certain stocks and I invest accordingly. DG didn't follow me to the Pilbara, DEG/CDT/MZN/KAI nor SL1 nor STM.
DG has averaged over 1000% for 3 years running.

865 2018-04-08 11:55:59 もういっかいプロローグ行ってみます
866 2018-04-08 11:55:11 You could have put a tie on.
867 2018-04-08 11:55:05 Were you disturbed that almost 500 people were shot with a dozen assault rifles with bump stocks? Or a school full of children, annually?
868 2018-04-08 11:54:47 STOCKS!! 2-3
869 2018-04-08 11:54:22 Watching $SPY, $QQQ, $IBB, $TWTR and $TSLA next few days. Maybe $NFLX as an earnings play. Many other interesting stocks and ETFs I guess, but as I said, I am a better trader if I focus on only a few names.
870 2018-04-08 11:51:08 I had some fun buying and sell stocks last year but now im doing tax paperwork for 22 dollars in gains...... can i just not?
871 2018-04-08 11:50:49 I’m sitting on 20 stocks at the moment.
872 2018-04-08 11:49:02 When stocks and shares crash or house prices collapse, you might expect people to become more cautious. 
In fact,
they take more risks.
873 2018-04-08 11:48:36 @GrooveCubeMusic and @BolideOfficial smokes meditate like stiletto stocks .   
874 2018-04-08 11:46:56 If it never trades again, for options holders would that include a cash deal in difference of contracts? I’m curious the duration of the halt on stocks that do reopen for trading? Seems difficult to find.
875 2018-04-08 11:44:26 That doesn't make any sense at all. I'm no liberal, but the Stock Market predated Trump, no one argues that. You don't have to be responsible for a "bump" in order to crash certain stocks by trashing them on Twitter or by playing "trade war" like a 20th century idiot progressive.

883 2018-04-08 11:39:28 Ahh Nortel. Gives me heartburn. One of stocks that I bought in early 2000’s thinking it will be revived. Lost 90% of my Nortl invst. I just started investing back then.  It was my first taste of investment loss.
884 2018-04-08 11:37:27 Look at the fees for music training at conservatoires - even more expensive. And then you have to pay  travel costs to get there.

896 2018-04-08 11:20:10 That's my point! The NRA was beat to the courts by the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF). The same NRA that support the ban on bump stocks. Makes me wonder what firearm related item will they support the banning of next?

I’m trying to cut down as I’m currently holding 44 stocks realistically it’s impossible to control so......

How many stocks do you hold in your portfolio
900 2018-04-08 11:15:02 I applaud many of the younger adult crypto traders who are not only learning how to read chart patterns, but are studying hard at technical analysis and AI trading programming

Once they see that these new skill sets translate well into stocks, they will be future trading leaders
901 2018-04-08 11:14:33 Johnson almost admits that they have samples ,so that means they have undeclared stocks of nerve agent as well.

905 2018-04-08 11:10:42 I personally believe fees should be lowered not completely abolished. I think you need some income to fund panels for what we really need more of: regional and national auditions. Trains fairs are one of the biggest barriers. People simply can't afford to get to their auditions.
906 2018-04-08 11:05:53 I mean it’s funny that it’s claimed that #sarin gas was used in #Syria #douma when the Syrian army is confirmed to have destroyed its stocks of sarin?
907 2018-04-08 11:05:38 So many gangs have access to chemical weapons! Including our own USG! We have many military bases where stockpiles of these gases exist. Not sure our stocks secure & none sleeping on the job! Some time ago I read a story of lax security at our missile site! Napalm in Vietnam!
908 2018-04-08 11:05:28 Again that's an old link. I'm not defending the practice at all but the EU is in the process of reform and has banned the discards policy.
Also, it's not just the EU which has been responsible for overfishing and waste. The whole world has depleted their fish stocks :-/

913 2018-04-08 10:58:00 No. Fishing is a major issue. Our waters and the EU nations abused it. Hence problems of low stocks of fish.
914 2018-04-08 10:56:42 When I see this on paper np. Until then it is speculative hot air. Nothing, and one of the most overvalued stocks on the asx given level of accomplishment. A gem on the moon if you will. And again resource in the ground yes. Resouce to build a road. No.
915 2018-04-08 10:53:29 Already feeling the pain with my few stocks but fully believe & TRUST @POTUS to know what he's doing so going to sit it out, drink lots of Pepto Bismol & stop watching the stock market until I hear @Varneyco @cvpayne say we're in the clear.
916 2018-04-08 10:45:28 I am yet to believe payporte is a notable brand or stocks quality wears .
917 2018-04-08 10:44:27 You do know that fish stocks where running out before the EU started to control catches to allow stocks to recover. Without the EU, those fishermen would have been out of a job long ago. #Leave #Remain

922 2018-04-08 10:38:37 Banning rapid firing rifles, and certain powerful firearms and bump stocks, which increase a rifles’ rate of fire;
How by banning "Bump Stocks" when their use is connected to firearms that were banned in the 1987/88 acts? 
Please explain how that works?
923 2018-04-08 10:37:53 This is not hard. 
It is not that NRA *members* commit these atrocities. 
The NRA gives $ to candidates, so they will not vote for gun control - like bump stocks, limiting the size of mags, or raising the age to purchase a gun.
924 2018-04-08 10:36:45 After selling everyone’s private information we may not have too. There stocks are dropping and people are shutting down their accounts. They are going to start charging to keep your info private
925 2018-04-08 10:35:37 Why do you want to ban bump stocks which only work on semi auto rifles which are illegal in the UK?
926 2018-04-08 10:35:20 Protect the American Civil Liberties Union and other robotic stocks aren't performing well.

939 2018-04-08 10:20:26 Logical conclusion of capitalism. In the 80 and 60 companies paid the lion's share of the taxes that benefitted the population. Today that burden is carried by workers.

944 2018-04-08 10:15:24 I agree that insurance is largely to blame. So why are you trying to get the rich to pay for this mistake? At any rate it is potential; Zuckerberg can't just liquidate his net worth of FB stocks. And redistributing fiat won't change the supply and demand of food.

949 2018-04-08 10:07:38 Medications & procedures are often inflated because we give insurance corporations the benefit of the doubt. We then give them tax cuts & instead of lower premiums, better coverage etc the companies use their savings to buyback their own stocks so CEOs get a payday.

958 2018-04-08 09:54:33 May be no positives fundamentally over the next 1 yr to stay in banking sector for stock earnings of 60-70% ! Just my opinion. Bank stocks will provide a good chance by Nov18 at the earliest.
959 2018-04-08 09:48:10 Overvalued smaller stocks give illusion of growth, but often gains lost within a few years

2nd/3rd division management team skills.

Less diversification of products/services.

Less access to capital & can go bust

Shareholders are bought out for once off premium if succeeds.

980 2018-04-08 09:25:08 1/ Yes exactly that’s why the progressive dividend/ income stocks have been the biggest winners in my portfolio as there’s a direct correlation with increasing dividends and increasing share price.
981 2018-04-08 09:25:03 nowadays since market started falling and your stocks corrected  by 60% you started talking about social issues and not about stocks you reccomended.

1006 2018-04-08 08:41:08 More often, you'll find a lot of people with various selling strategies. 

Few sell their stocks once 10-20% appreciation is achieved while others may sell whenever a stock falls down by 5-8%. Some may sell after gaining 2-3x returns while a few might sell based on a news rumour.

1029 2018-04-08 08:00:01 ETFs Morph Bond Risk. A key feature of bonds is the promise of the return of principal and some rate of interest. Unlike stocks, the terms are defined in advance because bonds forgo upside. Bond ETFs never return principal and the rate of interest in always uncertain.

1) Do you think it's good to follow stocks related news and global market progress before making any buy or sell call? 
2) Do you think if we strict to the chart and follow how market progress is sufficient for Intraday trading?
1039 2018-04-08 07:46:10 You’re the ones protesting because you haven’t got the Brexit you want. Do some research into UK government policy regarding replenishing fish stocks and you’ll understand the idiocy of Farage’s posturing.

1052 2018-04-08 07:31:08 My question is who is buying up the stocks on the down swing? Bet dollars to donuts oil and mineral stocks are being bought in correlation to the shrinking of national monuments. We are being sold off bit by bit.

1068 2018-04-08 07:15:57 These are some high beta stocks for a retiree. Do not panic and sell. You have some solid stocks that will be the first to recover. Sell-and-buy back is tough and finding bottoms is harder.
1069 2018-04-08 07:15:12 Hope this will consolidate around ₹150 region and will make a strong base before the next leg of up move. Then this will be a perfect buy. The stocks skyrocket in no time will come down the same way.

1101 2018-04-08 05:52:08 @konamona  but how much are you down shorting stocks? A trade war is a macro event that would cause a short term dip only

1104 2018-04-08 05:49:49 the fact that many stocks across the board are decreasing significantly in value (which you can find this info anywhere on the internet) and that a trade war is severely unhealthy on international trade which is a strong part of our economy.

1108 2018-04-08 05:42:51 yes but I hope most of the people buy it for the same reasons, what about commodity stocks ?

1110 2018-04-08 05:40:37 Fair enough.

But when the hero gets a AR15 tell him to go after the adults would you: John Wayne's stocks go down every time little coffins are put in 3by5 holes and mothers who have not fired a gun have to tell their alive children why they died.

1143 2018-04-08 05:05:18 I agree. We should encourage unilateral illegal intervention without investigation, and in total ignorance and disregard of not only lack of political and military advantage to an attack like this by the Syrian Army, but also to the documented chem weapons stocks of terrorists.

1147 2018-04-08 05:01:39 Sugar prices at two year low.

Sugar output is 45% more compared to previous year. 

But many of us will continue to hold sugar stocks as long term investor. Better choice will be to sell these companies and shift to sector with better prospects such as road construction/infra.

1169 2018-04-08 04:11:05 Yo those last stocks
1170 2018-04-08 04:08:53 Text/DM me a stock portfolio with up to 5 stocks and I can tell you if our trading algorithms show buy or sell signals. I will send you the data!
1171 2018-04-08 04:08:24 2012/13 was Obama's line in the sand bs with Syria, The Ghoutha gas attacks, the repeal of Smith Mundt act  (anti propaganda) and Russia's UN veto of Obama's boots on the ground, everything started going crazy around this time, war stocks too? thanks for the interview David.
1172 2018-04-08 04:05:45 Bump stocks need to be banned completely and we need comprehensive gun reform how many more people need to loose their lives for that concept to be heard by congress
1173 2018-04-08 04:02:08 So you don't pay attention? Automatic weapons are ALREADY banned.........bump stocks are supposedly being outlawed by DOJ. Good luck banning quick trigger fingers tho!!
1174 2018-04-08 04:00:20 I’ve been on $IRT and $BRG over the last month, they are up 10% on principle and paid a div of 2% which is a total of 12% gains for home gamers, stay with stocks that benefit from lower rates
1175 2018-04-08 04:00:09 Novices trade stocks. Novices are driven by fear and greed which are triggered by MSM headlines. The volatility is making the pro traders very wealthy. There will be a correction down on the DOW to 20K to 22K. A year from now, the DOW will break 30K.
1176 2018-04-08 03:59:40 $DSGT The Fibonacci spiral has predicted moves at every mark so far and the next mark is Monday so there could be a big move.  Up or down IDK but if I HAD to guess, I 'd say down without news

1177 2018-04-08 03:59:07 Wise enough ! that's all those stocks are meant for in 80% of the cases. The balance 20% stocks are those whom most are not in it, and content in remaining in Awe of its move!
1178 2018-04-08 03:59:02 Obama and Clinton came in mid recessions when stocks were at their lowest making for steeper gains as the economy recovered. Trump and GW B came in during better economic times so stocks had less room to grow
1179 2018-04-08 03:58:01 Right but if we are talking about Parkland a semi auto firearm with a bump stock attached becomes a fully automatic assault rifle. So nobody should make the case of a blanket gun ban when the real issue are these bump stocks.
1180 2018-04-08 03:56:16 Not in portfolio, mention here and there comes sometimes,I become worried if stocks I own start getting discussed on social media regularly,but I might have done short term trading in them
1181 2018-04-08 03:54:52 $CDIX will be a 2000+ bagger at these prices. As soon the MEGA MERGER 8k drops all hell will break loose! Shares post merger are valued at .70!! Currently at .0246 is a steal!! CDIX is still in buying zone ASAP #stocks #stockstowatch #markets #hedgefunds #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
1182 2018-04-08 03:52:32 I often quip that The Astounding  purpose of Modern life is to work hard and save all our Money in Banks ,Stocks and Real Estate assets and in turn make all those things Rich that we measure ourselves with;but who knows maybe Computer Algos and Nerds who Program know this better!
1183 2018-04-08 03:51:44 Do you have stocks in Portfolio that are heavily discussed on social media?

1186 2018-04-08 03:44:26 They aren't actually rare, but they do play crucial roles in everything from smart phones to electric car motors, hard drives, wind turbines, military radar, smart bombs, laser guidance, and more. They're also quite difficult to mine and process.
1187 2018-04-08 03:43:28 An AR rifle is just a rifle painted black with some cool looking stocks. Nothing more

1189 2018-04-08 03:41:32 Rare earths are also at work in cell phones and computers. Fighter jets and smart weapons, like cruise missiles, rely on them. In national defense, there is no substitute and no other supply source available.
1190 2018-04-08 03:40:56 They make the things we take for granted, from the small motors in automobiles to the wind turbines that are revolutionizing the production of electricity, many times more efficient. Rare earths increase a conventional magnet’s power by at least fivefold.
1191 2018-04-08 03:38:34 Rare earths" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements crucial to the manufacture of many hi-tech products. These are elements like dysprosium, neodymium, gadolinium, and ytterbium.Rare earths are great multipliers and the heaviest are the most valuable.
1192 2018-04-08 03:37:39 Well but Trump did tell them both in advance so nothing was damaged.  Millions wasted.  At least Trumps stocks went up!
1193 2018-04-08 03:37:19 Close loopholes
Ban bump stocks
Ban military style weapons (please don’t debate semantics here) 
Stricter background checks. 
Some type of insurance mandate for gun owners
1194 2018-04-08 03:35:15 Seriously dude, $5k ain’t squat especially if you’re putting out there that the big moves come from the higher priced stocks. How about $20k?  That’s only $5k a month.
1195 2018-04-08 03:33:17 Why don’t don’t you just not get health insurance and save your money in a CD, IRA, stocks, or something? You can pay out of pocket if you ever need it. Most of the world doesn’t have health insurance.
1196 2018-04-08 03:32:57 I think a more feasible trade involving Seattle’s #18 & the Browns would be:

SEA trades: #18
CLE trades: #35, #64, Patriots’ 2019 3rd round pick

SEA stocks up on picks missing from Duane Brown & S. Richardson trades. Browns can target McGlinchey or Sutton at 18 & still keep #33

1203 2018-04-08 03:26:26 From Axios:
Dow Jones Industrial Average return, if you invested in that basket of stocks, for a president's first 444 days (ranked since 1900,) per Bloomberg:

FDR : 70.4%
Reagan: 41.4%
Teddy Roosevelt: 37.4%
Obama: 32.5%
Bill Clinton: 32.2%
George H.W. Bush: 21.4%
Trump: 20.7%
1204 2018-04-08 03:22:20 kunwari rollback ng ilang sentimos ngayon pero next week may balak mag price hike ng piso mahigit ulit. tsk. lumang tugtugin. The reason why I never buy stocks to support these petroleum companies.
1205 2018-04-08 03:20:03 me too saying this.sometime moves showing like illiquid stocks. i think ,just pro n real trader exist at this time.
1206 2018-04-08 03:19:45 I've had in a chance, come home from families with me, and large cap stocks are we are fluctuating wildly.

#worstpresidentever
1209 2018-04-08 03:17:04 He gave up on all those failed businesses. And what do you call filing for  bankruptcy except giving up. Speaking of jealousy, he's jealous of Jeff Bezos. Bezos just lost $16 billion in stocks, and he's still 10 times richer than Trump. That bugs the hell out of Trump.

1211 2018-04-08 03:13:56 @realDonaldTrump stocks are dropping again.  Way to go!! WPE!!!!
1212 2018-04-08 03:13:48 Not even a mention by Carlo of stocks for women who wear pants, even with the 280 character limit. Disappointing.
1213 2018-04-08 03:11:17 He was pretty good. Considering he had to deal with bad recession 1st year. Job rate was low. Stocks were high.
1214 2018-04-08 03:11:06 Ok let me see if I can put this in a language you will understand. Without a bump stock an AR 15 shoots one bullet per trigger pull. Trump is banning bump stocks. Does that help you any
1215 2018-04-08 03:09:29 I've exercised puts on halted stocks before.
1216 2018-04-08 03:09:20 Lol.  Do you own any stocks?  Don’t worry I’m pretty sure KM will do just fine without you owning 1 share.  Mike talks a lot about solar panels but he doesn’t own one of those either!

1234 2018-04-08 02:49:12 Stocks = Equity 
A share of common or preferred stock is an equity stake (share) in ownership interest.  If you own 1,000 shares of Boeing stock then your equity ownership is determined by your stake (1,000 shares) vs. total outstanding shares issued.
1235 2018-04-08 02:48:13 @JoeNBC Universal background checks and banning assault (military-style) firearms, bump stocks (modifiers), and high cap mags can be implemented under current 2nd Amendment Law.  It would not affect ownership of other firearms.
1236 2018-04-08 02:47:50 So about 1/2 of $MU and $TXN sales are in China?  Those stocks may continue to get hit, but if the tariff war doesn't play out too badly in the end, these may be two beaten up stocks to buy.
1237 2018-04-08 02:47:38 And the Obama economy ended in January 2018 and since then stocks are tanking and a big recession is soon upon us from the Crazies running shit.
1238 2018-04-08 02:47:07 Seriously? OBAMA is responsible for the divide in this country.
Disgrace America? Lowest unemployment. 3 million jobs created. Energy dominant. Record high stocks. Get your head out of the sand.
1239 2018-04-08 02:46:03 (fyi that means if gains are included in income, you can earn $96,000 by selling capital assets [i.e. stocks] a year and pay *0%* tax on it; tons of trust fund kids live like that)

1254 2018-04-08 02:17:15 Like I get it’s hard to get out when you’re a parent but also bringing your 3+ kids into a cramped cafe should lead to charges of public nuisance. Put that nine year-old who won’t be quiet in the stocks in the olde town square

1272 2018-04-08 01:57:36 Stocks only trades 5 days a week, 32h 30 mins/wk, 9 holidays a yr including weekends thats a total of 1,501.5 hrs/yr. Bitcoin and crypto trades 365 days a yr, 24/7 that is 8,760 hrs/yr. So 1 yr in Bitcoin and crypto is 5.83 yrs in Stock Market. I say no.

1283 2018-04-08 01:42:08 Why? People with 401k plans are buying shares at a lower rate. As a result of President Trump’s action American manufacturers will have a more level playing field. Stocks will go back up and people with 401k plans will get a larger increase for their investment.

1296 2018-04-08 01:22:39 Returns better than a lot of other stocks out there.
1297 2018-04-08 01:21:14 You’re not wrong there. Stocks dropped 50% after mania30. Now, they’re as good as ever. And yeah. They still haven’t brought back some things they’ve taken away, but I guess that’s cuz they realized it wasn’t worth the cost regardless of their income. (Pyro, jobbers, custom ppv)

1299 2018-04-08 01:19:42 This is interesting market. We could be close to a bottom but for following reasons, I am not very confident. 

1- we had a sell signal in stocks in Jan, which happens every 2 years on avg
2-  Market structure suggests further decline
3- Too many bottom pickers

1302 2018-04-08 01:16:18 Then what is the right way? Nothing has been done in 20 plus years. Everybody freaks out about the market but if you have had any stocks for a year I bet it’s up overall. You have to crack a few eggs before you can bake a cake!

1304 2018-04-08 01:14:24 Well it’s true. Crypto is the easiest money the world has ever seen. The biggest bear market ever so far was child’s play compared to normal investing. Anyone who held made a profit in less than 5 years. Look at poor people who bought Japanese stocks at their peak.
1305 2018-04-08 01:13:06 I've seen bump stocks in action and thought they were useless toys because every one I saw was wildly inaccurate.  But the Las Vegas guy figured out how to sandbag and tripod them, Not a toy anymore.

1330 2018-04-08 00:54:52 TARIFFS ARE NOT THE SOLUTION!!! These are antiquated 19th century tactics that have never worked. YOUR trade war will institute an unnecessary tax on US consumers, cost jobs, cut economic growth and, as already witnessed, cause stocks to plummet. Please stop!!!!
1331 2018-04-08 00:53:31 It moves a lot during 24hrs. It’s volatile. People should check trends. It’s all a gamble. Imagine playing a stocks simulator and you speed up the timeframe X1000. That’s crypto.
1332 2018-04-08 00:52:45 They don't make enough in US is problem. Very little dividends paid. If Chinese firms, left and made goods for Us in Us, Chinese population couldn't live off dividends as most wouldn't own the stocks. The only way the US allows trade is if it is open, same rules both ways.
1333 2018-04-08 00:50:53 I have 25 shares since the tech wreck. I don't remember why I even had it.  I still have my technology/other stocks from years ago.  Recently sold some semis at their hi. But kept a few shares of each. I am in love with.  The market again.Thanks for teaching us. We appreciate it
1334 2018-04-08 00:44:43 now that i’m an “adult” i’m trying to follow the market and have realized that when stocks go up, it means absolutely nothing for anyone except the wealthy, but when it goes down, this place turns into The Weakest Link where everyone is fucked EXCEPT THE WEALTHY AGAIN

1336 2018-04-08 00:44:05 The portion of people that own GM stocks is small as a significant portion of their living expense. Gm stock not doing well anyway.
1337 2018-04-08 00:42:56 If you own Apple stocks or GM stocks, you’d be very happy that they make money in China.  Did you know 60% of Qualcomm’s revenue are from China?
1338 2018-04-08 00:39:41 Any Chinese stocks in that fund? See The China Hustle documentary. Scary.

How about Money Flow indicators?

1342 2018-04-08 00:26:22 I think that the tariffs are designed to make the stock market drop so his people can buy up all the good stocks at bargain prices. The moment he’s out of office the market will start to climb. Or am I giving him too much credit?
1343 2018-04-08 00:25:56 I'm looking for some with black plastic stocks. I know the ones with the brown wooden stocks use the same ammunition and work the same way, but for some reason the bad guys think the black plastic is scarier and I'd like the advantage of being more frightening.
1344 2018-04-08 00:25:42 You do realize that the problem with bump stocks isn't the accuracy, right? With a machine gun, accuracy doesn't matter, fire rate does. How much research did you do? I guess you have lots of time without a job or school. Sorry community College didn't work out

1349 2018-04-08 00:21:02 @RealDonaldTrump said stocks are up 40% & you may sacrifice some of that,a good negotiator doesn't give away whats already in your pocket,this moron may make Warren Buffets statement to his investors to be prepared to lose 1/2 of investments. @cxs

1423 2018-04-07 23:05:02 And how many people die in those knife attacks? NOONE IS PROPOSING BANNING ALL GUNS! Just some sensible gun reform like a ban on automatic weapons and bump stocks. I appreciate you proving my point though.
1424 2018-04-07 23:04:19 Not a fan of him but it feels like crypto needs faces like stocks do. Unfortunately all we got is McAfee.

1427 2018-04-07 23:02:42 Is it possible that Trump attacks Amazon and China, stocks fall, his back room boys buy low, he backs off, stocks return to value, they sell high making mega bucks?

1430 2018-04-07 23:00:45 Just finished casting at the collegiate smash league. Congrats to stony brook for taking it and @DabuzSenpai for taking 9 goddamn stocks. 

Also, shout outs to @Heroking_Anna for jumping on the Mic with me. Hope to see you do it more in the future!
1431 2018-04-07 23:00:13 My jeweler my age playin with stocks made 200,000 in 2 hours he boutta show me how to do it 
1432 2018-04-07 22:55:20 They should be treated as cars, a national database that tracks guns, ammo & accessories like bump stocks, universal background checks & a psychological evaluation taken annually to maintain the license to even own a gun. Those are my thoughts.
1433 2018-04-07 22:53:28 Blah blah US economy blah 1% blah stocks blah blah blah China blah blah Russians blah blah.

1435 2018-04-07 22:52:42 I know some stupid media #wacko_jackos will always pick on #Sterling as the reason for #Mancity loss tonight. When England loses its him. When London #stocks crashes..its caused by #RaheemSterling. Its crazy!

1437 2018-04-07 22:51:31 Used the same stocks and shapes as in this video
1438 2018-04-07 22:51:22 How is banning assault weapons and bump stocks infringing on your second amendment rights? You still get to own guns if you're mentally stable and 21 or older.
1439 2018-04-07 22:50:34 As stupid as bump stocks are, this is exactly what I was afraid of.
1440 2018-04-07 22:50:00 hey did you hear about the stocks for bank of america? should really check it out
1441 2018-04-07 22:48:20 bro why u still trying to stay relevant when in fact you are already forgotten by almost everyone... at this point you should just give up this streaming/social activities... Do something else, stocks, crypto, open a business, get married, become dad. Internet don't want you.
1442 2018-04-07 22:47:52 I remember, like two years ago. My dogs use to call me and we talk about bitches for long minutes. Now, all we talk about is leveling up. Cribs, degrees, credit, stocks etc.
1443 2018-04-07 22:46:37 The tax cuts also have little bearing on the prosperity of Black Americans too. Most of it has gone to stocks owners and are getting huge dividends and buy backs. Black don't own as much. To me he is saying that blacks should settle for the secondary pull up from the tax cuts.

Your boyfriend: vomit on his shirt already, moms spaghetti
1448 2018-04-07 22:40:38 Hopefully, no one was hurt and there was not too much property damage still I know the insurance agents are crying right now. They're going to have to cash in some stocks and bonds to pay out the claims
1449 2018-04-07 22:40:13 And those tax cuts did not go to increased wages for workers but buybacks of stocks.

1451 2018-04-07 22:39:51 You’re right. It was a person who was able to access a vehicle unchecked. Can you imagine if that person had access to semi firearms,bump stocks or auto rifles. Imagine the damage that could do using them instead of a bulky vehicle with limited range of destruction (relatively) ?

1458 2018-04-07 22:29:25 Then you are ok banning bump stocks that convert that semi into full auto?

1462 2018-04-07 22:24:39 And not one quote states that the people may possess arms manufactured for war, high capacity magazines or bump stocks. Why? Because they were referring to MUSKETS in 1788. Don't be a fool.
1463 2018-04-07 22:22:46 I didn't miss it but I also don't see how they could say anything about lost stocks in 24 hours if they claim they don't have any. That's why I'm interested to know how past inspections worked because Russian compliance with CW destruction was recorded.

1465 2018-04-07 22:20:15 The UK government asked them to own up or investigate how they lost control of their stocks right at the start. Did you miss that?
1466 2018-04-07 22:18:32 Using the platform and putting your money in stocks is two different things. I sure would like to know where all you critics were during the Obama era were you not born yet?
1467 2018-04-07 22:18:32 Who are they buying back the stocks from?  People.  I personally have made over $356,000 from buybacks since the tax bill was signed.  Increasing stock value is good for investors like myself, who are people.

The NRA supports background checks, banning bump stocks, a temporary hold on people (through due process) who have been-
1470 2018-04-07 22:10:42 wants to kill they will kill with whatever weapon they dream up. President Trump has banned bump stocks that President Obama thought was a great idea, he banned EVERYTHING that will turn a REGULAR FIREARM into a fully automatic weapon. It's the PERSON NOT THE OBJECT

1473 2018-04-07 22:09:30 Larry I know you are traveling so no need to reply now. I changed my risk in stocks from .50% to .40% and my ETF has been adjusted from 1.0% to .85%.  Keeping more cash of course. Have you given thought to adjustments moving forward until markets settle down. Or staying same?

1476 2018-04-07 22:08:43 A pity we don’t still have the old stocks in the City Square we could put all these Lefty MSM grubs in them and EGG them ( I thought stoning perhaps a tad too harsh ) 
1477 2018-04-07 22:07:39 Assault rifle =/= Simi auto rifle that happens to look cool. Kinda like putting a 4 cylinder inside a Lamborghini.  Why didn't Obama ban bump stocks? Was there not enough political incentive?
1478 2018-04-07 22:02:13 Wait until they start shopping at #Walmart after the Chinese respond to #TrumpTariffs . They may not have stocks, but they shop.

1492 2018-04-07 21:48:43 Investors must learn to differentiate between Mistakes and Bad Luck. #UV_Lessons 
Mistake - taking a punt on debt-ridden stocks like #GVK #Jaypee 
Bad Luck - quality stock down xx% due to a market-wide or a stock-specific black-swan event - #DivisLabs down 50% on cGMP violation
1493 2018-04-07 21:47:34 IMO it's a mistake to assign significance to this short-term similarity.  If stocks tank, Bitcoin may take a hit (like gold in 2008) due to investor poverty.  Otherwise, I see little current basis for a causal relationship.  Bitcoin does not care about a trade war with China.
1494 2018-04-07 21:45:10 I know but just the fact that it’s an app rather than a person is what freaks me out

1505 2018-04-07 21:34:03 So @realDonaldTrump has been on a tangent complaining about this and that company and how they’re horrible businesses, and then their stock falls. Could Trump be buying up those stocks at rock bottom prices and getting even richer off his own propaganda?

1514 2018-04-07 21:24:57 I’m a fool like trump ,to bad  that we are both doing great , he the president and I have done great with stocks

1516 2018-04-07 21:23:16 No apologies required. No offence if you don't agree. Doing a county or country census of forage stocks would be almost unworkable. We'd be accused of nannying and rightly so.
1517 2018-04-07 21:22:51 Thank you. I was going nuts trying to figure out the context of that.
1518 2018-04-07 21:19:49 I day trade stocks for a living , only have about 6 percent of my trading account in altcoins.
1519 2018-04-07 21:18:56 Sometimes the stocks with less attention or votes outperform the favorites. Accumulation is looking good. Good luck with your trade/investments 
1520 2018-04-07 21:18:11 THIS IS INSANE AND THIS CORRUPT CONGRESSMAN SHOULD GO TO JAIL NOT THE CAPITAL!! THE GOP AND THE NRA BETTER FACE IT, GUN CONTROL IS HERE!!! NO ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS AND LARGE MAGAZINES AND WE WANT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS!! GET USED TO IT!!
1521 2018-04-07 21:17:23 Obama's gains were significantly higher than Trump's during an analagous period. I hope you don't analyze stocks with this sort of apples to orange comparison. It'd be terrible for your portfolio.
1522 2018-04-07 21:17:19 The state can ban different types of weapons like AR-15s, adjustable stocks, etc, but you’re grandfathered in! Sounds illegal to me!
1523 2018-04-07 21:17:04 Maybe we need a full on Watergate operation that's open to the public. All the people gumming up the gears should be called out publicly and shamed. And maybe stocks in the center of town would be a good idea.
1524 2018-04-07 21:15:21 So he's using the power of the President to manipulate stocks and penalize China in order to ease his own debt?  Sounds about right!
1525 2018-04-07 21:14:26 And one last thing—QUIT CALLING THESE GUNS “ASSAULT RIFLES” or “MILITARY-STYLE!!” This shows your ignorance. They are NOT fully automatic. The AR-15 and AK-47 are just metal versions of similar guns with wood stocks. The bullet used in an AK-47 is slightly larger than a .22!
1526 2018-04-07 21:14:24 There is but the OTC weed stocks are basically same deal as most crypto even if there are real companies too.

1529 2018-04-07 21:11:50 You don't know what you're talkin about you just keep listening to Trump he's lying he's trying to knock the stock down so he could buy stocks
1530 2018-04-07 21:08:59 Popcorn  stocks going through the roof should be trending! 
1531 2018-04-07 21:08:35 We’re feeling the pain (stocks, food, farming), but not giving up! We believe in #MAGA and we believe in our chief negotiator @realDonaldTrump.
1532 2018-04-07 21:06:47 Dow Jones Industrial Avg return, if we invested in that basket of stocks, for a president's first 444 days (ranked since 1900), per Bloomberg: 
FDR: 70.4% Reagan: 41.4% T. Roosevelt: 37.4% Obama: 32.5% Clinton: 32.2% George H.W. Bush: 21.4% Trump: 20.7%. @realDonaldTrump thought?
1533 2018-04-07 21:05:28 it's a marginal return per unit of investment story -- that's why most ppl miss out on these growth stocks
1534 2018-04-07 21:04:31 Growth stocks are valued at a normalized earnings 4-5 years out. Basically what's the business model at scale. Cyclical stocks are valued at peak vs trough. Looking at a NFLX one year out is being short-sighted. 3 years ago: what was cheap - GE or FB?
1535 2018-04-07 21:04:24 Stocks, gold, income producing agricultural land all should soar vs $
1536 2018-04-07 21:03:02 Can't even buy stocks of these breweries.
1537 2018-04-07 21:02:55 If there is a lot of bats stocks out there didn't tell us what you recommend that is good and we could become profitable and move forward?????
1538 2018-04-07 21:02:30 Jim, I hope you know that your calls on stocks are doing tremendous damage to the retail investors.. just remember that the people who lose money based on your recommendations don't call you OR you don't even take their calls.

1548 2018-04-07 20:54:20 That's only a portion of those who buy. Most buy as a currency or to support the technology. Also, this same argument could be said about most stocks or commodities.
1549 2018-04-07 20:52:44 We got stocks, bonds, IRA's, ETF's....

We got residual income and advanced degrees.

1550 2018-04-07 20:50:48 If anyone believe Presidents can’t affect stocks is delusional, what is true, no President has talk this much shit, it’s like he doesn’t know the consequences when he crazy talk like this, or he just doing it on purpose, either way is pretty sickening to watch
1551 2018-04-07 20:49:55 Some with folding stocks will fit, as may bullpups. This is entirely irrelevant, of course, other than for warding off a distraction attack from SuperBeets.

1559 2018-04-07 20:42:51 Trump is mentally unstable, undisciplined & a habitual liar who presided over a constantly bankrupt family business. He inherited a 92-month bull market in stocks & full-employment from @BarackObama. Negotiation is not unique to Trump—the insanity & upheaval is. #incompetent
1560 2018-04-07 20:42:41 What did Obama do? Oh ya, authorized bump stocks. Thanks Obama.
1561 2018-04-07 20:42:36 He didn't have my stocks & 401k in his hands then. He does now.  Needless to say, retirement is now farther away than it was.
1562 2018-04-07 20:40:18 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1563 2018-04-07 20:39:48 They paid a fortune for him. Ain’t scored yet 
1564 2018-04-07 20:39:27 Thats great. Because at the rate the stocks are dropping we are going to have to work for the rest of our lives!
1565 2018-04-07 20:39:21 He said it took bottle but he didn’t want them players to take the penalty....pick someone else then you ballbag, you’re the manger
1566 2018-04-07 20:39:07 I know, why the relied on gaz Madine! Playing at Bolton earlier in the season
1567 2018-04-07 20:38:20 But isn’t the AR-15 modeled after the M16? Isn’t just a civilian version of the rifle. Even though the rifle isn’t full auto doesn’t mean that modifications can’t be done to make it fire like one. Bump stocks and modifications to the trigger are examples of a whole array of mods.
1568 2018-04-07 20:37:46 If only he had a player who could take a free shot from 12 yards... twice!
1569 2018-04-07 20:37:38 I guess you haven't heard the numerous "Thanks Obama!" When the stocks hit records.
1570 2018-04-07 20:37:38 Read speculation that he has shills shorting stocks for him. Particularly Amazon stock.
1571 2018-04-07 20:37:36 I know, he is such a sore loser! Why wouldn't the wolves lot celebrate! 
1572 2018-04-07 20:36:36 He’s classless....next minute FUCK OFF...like he’s in a pub argument
1573 2018-04-07 20:36:26 The van was equipped with bump stocks too.
1574 2018-04-07 20:36:18 Agriculture sector and Food products. After 10 yrs, the population could be 160 cr. 
Many stocks that are trading below 50 today could reach to 1000 odd, important is to have great management.
1575 2018-04-07 20:35:58 He shorts stocks so Jr. and cronies can buy at bargain rates through their many LLCs.
1576 2018-04-07 20:35:54 He’ll be sacked by the end of this season 
1577 2018-04-07 20:35:53 Hey bro- What other stocks do you like long?
1578 2018-04-07 20:35:33 And throws his toys out when it doesn't 
1579 2018-04-07 20:35:22 That classless fuck telling the wolves manager he’s got non of it 
1580 2018-04-07 20:35:18 On mobile, this looked like the kitty was in the stocks!
1581 2018-04-07 20:35:12 Haha we will be fine mate, don't you worry!! Just concentrate on that Dingle of yours heckingbottom 
1582 2018-04-07 20:35:05 Gets the job done though!
1583 2018-04-07 20:34:33 i can say i turned out fine bc i know where my mental health stands and if anything from my childhood “traumatized” me.
1584 2018-04-07 20:34:31 I really hope Cardiff mess it up!! What a prick Warnock is!!
1585 2018-04-07 20:34:26 That one was a wash out! That one boomeranged
I notice a lot of trumps dictates go wrong. But definitely, the taxscam was a disaster. You got 1.50 or 18 dollars a week more on paycheck. The rich got millions and billions. Jobs are down. They bought back stocks. We got the deficit
1586 2018-04-07 20:34:23 You’ll not see the playoffs for a few years lad, the amount of debt you boys are in
1587 2018-04-07 20:34:16 I don't understand the hate you are receiving @jimcramer. I for one appreciate the advice you give on stocks and the knowledge you share. For what it's worth, I don't want my investments to become political collateral.
1588 2018-04-07 20:33:47 In other words, given that realized vol is already high - skew is telling you the marginal increase in vol for a further selloff is not that high, compared to when realized vol was ~0 and stocks were at the highs. Which I think makes sense.
1589 2018-04-07 20:33:08 Yeah they are but shows if we had full squad back reckon we would of been up there again this year!! 
Haha yeah I heard he had booked his hotel for the playoff final.. 
1590 2018-04-07 20:33:00 I think I described it as ‘nailed on’ 

Fulham will bottle it and Fucking millwall will go up 
1591 2018-04-07 20:32:36 As Donald Trump continues with his fight against Amazon his advisors should remind him that he is playing around with people's 401k's. 

Everytime Amazon  stocks plunge due to Trump's rhetoric, some American workers lose their pension.
1592 2018-04-07 20:31:25 Fulham are decent though. Fancy them in there play offs. 
Speaking of play offs.. what is around this time last season Leeds were guaranteed a spot @adam_stocks_ ?
1593 2018-04-07 20:29:56 Looked into stocks etc I blow so much money i don’t have on stuff I don’t need mostly it’s time to blow somewhere it can potentially grow
1594 2018-04-07 20:28:34 Since the high on 1/26, the index has now lost $2.34 trillion in market cap, bringing the total down to $23.12 trillion. This means that 37% of the post-Spanky's @realDonaldTrump market cap have been erased during the current market pullback.

1595 2018-04-07 20:27:18 Do you intend to misunderstand me?

Not stocks, but samples. Maybe even held for only a few days before being destroyed. It is the knowledge of the properties that is wanted, not the substance.

VX? No, they are probably trying to assesd new agents before others deploy them.
1599 2018-04-07 20:23:21 Try to explain your answer is just an excuse ! For oil you have good estimates about supply and consumption - you can very well calculate a fair price. For stocks you have good indications about future profits. What is your reason to say a CC is cheap?

1603 2018-04-07 20:20:32 Jim, as you yourself have admitted, labor has been short-changed in our country for many decades. Owners and stocks have been favored. There needs to be a bit of balance here. That's what Trump is trying to provide- although it isn't clear he knows how to go about that!
1604 2018-04-07 20:20:04 Just reminded why need to stick to stock markets on twitter. This thing is useless and full of uneducated morons.
Note to self: read/follow stocks/options only...everyone/everthing else are morons...especially political nitwits
1605 2018-04-07 20:19:19 I would agree with that. If I can't directly sale my stocks and bonds to you then why can I sell you a gun.
1606 2018-04-07 20:19:17 @NeNeLeakes - so he’s in for tricking stocks?

1613 2018-04-07 20:14:32 You are putting the US in a trade war. Everything we buy we be going up. Stocks are crashing fuel prices up. Inflation is here Recession is coming. Worse president in US HISTORY
1614 2018-04-07 20:12:55 President’s have at most a very limited impact on equity and other risk asset returns (whether positive or negative). 
[also, 42, 43 and 44 were inaugurated during or immediately after a recession, when stocks were in a trough. This makes comparisons irrelevant]
1615 2018-04-07 20:11:48 Let's not forget there is an alternative to open net salmon farming which pollutes & threatens wild salmon stocks. Closed containment can be combined with aquaponics, is scalable and compatible with crofting & tourism. Scotland should be creating quality salmon, not junk food.

1618 2018-04-07 20:07:53 The Dow dropped 500 points yesterday as stocks resume trade- driven declines which would have been great to buy into that dip but not for me 
1619 2018-04-07 20:07:41 A guy that’s notirious for shorting stocks to death and controls the media(fud). I hope he never buys a single btc.
1620 2018-04-07 20:07:24 I would love to meet other shareholders and professionals at the 2018 BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY Annual meeting. You are welcome to tag along with my wife and me, let me know! #BerkshireHathaway #investors #investments #WarrenBuffett #StockMarket #stocks
1621 2018-04-07 20:07:13 Stocks go up and down on the daily moron!!! They are going to tank with people being skeptical! Expected!! We still can’t keep getting spanked by China in the long term to keep everyone at bay in the short! U probably never gave him cred for the rise to beg with!! Lol!!
1622 2018-04-07 20:06:35 It's also inaccurate that Obama approved of bump stocks. It was determined that under the current legal guidelines they could not be regulated.  you could argue that he could have rallied to change the law but at the time it was not a priority and could hinder success elsewhere
1623 2018-04-07 20:06:11 It's funny how Dems give credit for the stock markets loss this week to Tarrifs(Still 40% above Obama or Bush) when it's Tech stocks flailing back to reality.They are out of Control & way overpriced. Facebook just killed Tech Sector, & regulation is coming. I expect a bumby ride.
1624 2018-04-07 20:05:01 Can you help us understand how to best protect a long term portfolio if we don’t want to sell all stocks? Thanks for your continued guidance!
1625 2018-04-07 20:04:41 Stocks the gamblers of the economy TRUMP maybe who knows Jobs may be created for the people=the FOUNDATION of a STABLE INTERNAL ECONOMY too simplistic or a non negotiable for the populous? @business @NewsHour @BBCBreaking @abcnews
1626 2018-04-07 20:03:05 Donny lies again.  This desperation to be right, even when facts don’t support it, is why he keep having to file bankruptcy,

He’s a liar.  Job growth is down.  Stocks are down.  America is at risk because of his incompetence.
1627 2018-04-07 20:01:26 Need somebody to put me on game with stocks
1628 2018-04-07 20:01:06 @EiriasPe @EiriasPe - we back Monday or Tuesday?
1629 2018-04-07 20:00:28 What a bastard. I will not be surprise he is also dumping stocks.
1630 2018-04-07 19:57:53 Street stocks from @lucasspeedway on @MAVTV... I'm watching that
1631 2018-04-07 19:57:19 Preplanned Choreographed Dance?  Huge Corps. get huge tax breaks.  Trump crashes stocks with tweets.  Rich corps buy back stocks at huge discount.  Congress steps in and stops tariffs and stocks will skyrocket again.  Rich win again.
1632 2018-04-07 19:56:49 disney stocks will go down
1633 2018-04-07 19:56:16 It's easy to explain.  Stocks were worth less when Obama came to power than when Trump did, so any little gain will have a higher precentage.  A $10 gain on $100 is a 10% gain, where as if stock was $1000 it would only be a 1% gain.
1634 2018-04-07 19:54:13 If I was Bezos I would nail that trump trash to the freaking wall! trump has to know when he has tweet tantrums it affects the stocks, and this IS his intention.  That cant possibly be legal.  Bezos could do so much damage to trump, so we shall wait and see how it goes down.
1635 2018-04-07 19:54:03 I do wonder if Trump’s friends weren’t alerted to his upcoming actions and sold their stocks high and are buying, for instance Amazon, at bargain basement rates? It would not surprise me. 
1636 2018-04-07 19:51:10 Cool. I’ve been looking at Qualcomm’s stock post-merger-breakup and it seems more reasonably priced than most tech stocks. Perhaps post-breakup anxiety is still priced into the stock.
1637 2018-04-07 19:48:08 same as bernie ebbers of worldcom they going shut facebook down same way soon,tila tequila guaranteed it is going to go bankrupt soon-stocks going pluge down cause he banned her off facebook
1638 2018-04-07 19:47:51 To be fair stocks go up and down. In another week the figures above could all change.
That’s not denying that Trump claims credit for every see but disowns any falls
1639 2018-04-07 19:47:47 The states aren't banning AR15s. They are banning certain COSMETIC features of AR15s. CA for instance banned pistol grips, adjustable stocks, and flash suppressors. So now we have guns that are much less pretty NOT LESS DEADLY. You guys brilliant!!!!
1640 2018-04-07 19:47:37 Same as stocks then?
1641 2018-04-07 19:44:48 -->  

Trump directly opposed NRA on: 
bump-stocks, 
age-limit to buy AR-15s
gun seizure for those (unstable) that pose risk

5 million received increased wages & bonuses due to #TaxCutsandJobsAct All States get a reduced tax rate, so its up to state legislatures.
1642 2018-04-07 19:44:46 Some of my favorites he clued us in on was Facebook, he asked questions we should all be asking and other anonymous ppl on 4chan/8chan filled in the blanks. Such as the data for sale, stocks mark z sold off, doc gathering info for Facebook. Things i wouldn’t have thought of
1643 2018-04-07 19:44:31 @InterestRateArb @biancoresearch seems contrarian positive for stocks if you overlay the S&P on top of the spread history
1644 2018-04-07 19:44:06 What I'm saying is. If what they're defending it by saying they've been whipped and fine, it kinda plays into what the previous person is saying. It's not a good way to go about it.
1645 2018-04-07 19:43:19 Who cares what you think since it can’t happen and since you don’t seem to realize that? Stop being a trump puppet. It’s so unbecoming.
1646 2018-04-07 19:42:54 Weekends are a great time to carry out your "due diligence" on #uranium #stocks in #resources #mining sector & research #U3O8 demand from #nuclear #energy global growth.... between games  & naps  & parties of course.

1649 2018-04-07 19:41:40 There is no gun show loophole. Every gun dealer runs the background check. That's the law. Bump stocks are useless anyway because they reduce accuracy and waste ammo, and what would a expanded background check do that the current background check doesn't?

1655 2018-04-07 19:37:19 I don't know the details of Heller but I think often times scope refers to what is meant by the term "arms." This came up in a video I watched about bump stocks, ie can they be considered a firearm or not?
1656 2018-04-07 19:37:16 Wonder what stocks he shorted last month?
1657 2018-04-07 19:37:08 Why on earth would you think holding stocks would defend the UK.. VX is more than thirty years old,still no antidote.. and given ‘proper’ nerve agents work in minutes, how do you imagine an antidote being given to 65 million folk?
1658 2018-04-07 19:36:42 I have a question. What, in your opinion, would constitute sensible gun laws? And President Trump has promised stronger mental health treatment, banning the bump stocks that Obama signed in favor of, and closing the gun show loophole.
1659 2018-04-07 19:35:48 Automatic weapons are illegal unless you spend thousands of dollars for a government permit that is very hard to get. As it should be. The federal government just banned bump stocks which I fully agree with.
1660 2018-04-07 19:33:52 I'm not talking hunting rifles. I did not mention ARs. I said assault type weapons. I should have specified weapons that fire multiple times per second. I should have said no bump stocks. I should have said no damn flame thrower for f* cks sake. Just stop killing the kids!

1667 2018-04-07 19:24:56 Since Trump lobbed the first volley in this war of words and tariffs on March 1, the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks has fallen around 4%. Based on the market value of all domestic equities, that works out to around $1.2 trillion in lost stock market wealth. “How’s your 401k doing?”

1670 2018-04-07 19:23:21 Stocks are good in the long range (really long range) but volatile in the short range.
1671 2018-04-07 19:23:16 Stocks drop more than 2% on @realDonaldTrump ‘s I’ll-advised tariff trade policy with China and screwing a robust economy. #TrumpTariffs #TradeWar
1672 2018-04-07 19:22:31 True but I'm holding the bag on all my stocks already 
1673 2018-04-07 19:21:18 They should classify them as class 3 license on the magazines and bump stocks.
1674 2018-04-07 19:20:13 Yes.  If stocks can rise ad infinitum on low volatility (basically 2017 in markets, every year for the next 10-15 yrs), things can work out well.  Failing that, things will likely get a bit bumpy.
1675 2018-04-07 19:17:34 Smarter, like when people were buying stocks like nortel at infinite pe ratios? But the big difference is not that stock market investors are smarter, but that they don't operate with borrowed money, except for a few.
1676 2018-04-07 19:17:17 So here's my theory: @realDonaldTrump imposes tariffs on china, stocks plummet, trumps friends and family buy up stocks at Rock bottom prices. Trump then eases tariffs, stocks sky rocket back up. Trump family and friends make MILLIONS!!!
If you don't believe this, just watch!!!
1677 2018-04-07 19:17:00 Maybe with stocks of Novichok.

1684 2018-04-07 19:10:54 This lunatic is playing some sort of shady proposition. Notice how the stock market plunged each time he tweets this crap...? Could be he and/or his pals are taking large short positions in stocks...SEC should investigate...he's a crook.
1685 2018-04-07 19:10:26 Any companies attacked by Trump should adjust their shareholder agreements to restrict anyone associated with @realDonaldTrump from purchasing stock. As stocks drop it'll prevent him from making a come up later on. @JeffBezos  take note and pass on the word!

In the initial days I even had shares of LITL.
1687 2018-04-07 19:09:12 With your Wall Street cabinet members wonder how they feel about you playing with the stock market by waging a tariff War who are they telling to move stocks who are they warning I'm sure no one is comfortable losing tens of  millions of dollars 
You're unable to govern wisely

1689 2018-04-07 19:07:10 Dave I agree with you for the most part.  But with Japan and China's insatiable demand for seafood, it's hard to say that fish stocks are safe. These countries have zero regulations or controls on fishing, it's practically a free for all. What are your thoughts sir?
1690 2018-04-07 19:06:31 The most stocks of AJ 1 this year. There will be like 20 colorway of AJ1 in 2018 and this colorway has the most stocks
1691 2018-04-07 19:06:28 Can you define stocks sliding and compare the active return to either QQQ or INX ? YTD, MTD, YoY, MoM?
1692 2018-04-07 19:05:31 Un poco simples, mejora la iluminación y las letras. Y en el último me faltan más stocks y algo de color :)
1693 2018-04-07 19:05:20 Don't marry your stocks.
1694 2018-04-07 19:05:15 I still believe in you $MU , that DRAM wave isn't over yet. At least another 6 quarters of massive profits #MU #market #tradewar #fucktrump #stocks #volatile #calls #StockMarket
1695 2018-04-07 19:01:33 How about momentum trades with good stocks, and we always have an option to convert it to long term if it goes wrong. At least worked well for me in the past.
1696 2018-04-07 19:01:19 I'm sure u and stocks distracted dhiiv to never talk about today game  and never laugh at u both #RealWagsOfMzansi

Stocks......my little girl Reckons you have a superstition...do you hop on the white lines coming on and off the pitch????
Please settle this argument 
1698 2018-04-07 18:58:40 would make shorting stocks easier also :)
1699 2018-04-07 18:58:16 Never seen the report that stated that Jen. Also be interested to know who wrote that report. Having said that, we all know 7-8 million seals can’t help the fish stocks.
1700 2018-04-07 18:57:53 @sahneydeepak Sir, Which Stocks in Focus For Next Week Buy Or Sell..!!
1701 2018-04-07 18:57:07 Oh nice. I'm guessing you need some knowledge of stocks though?
1702 2018-04-07 18:56:54 did buy point eval on stocks i own this morning and found my pt for $mu is nearly 9 bucks down from my avg cost - took a shot but think ill sell Mon at small loss
1703 2018-04-07 18:56:13 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
1704 2018-04-07 18:56:12 Buy the index, any Nifty ETF, would be the safest bet, may not yield as a few of the suggested stocks might, but wud never go to zero either.

Eg. Goldman Sachs Nifty BeES
1705 2018-04-07 18:55:30 Regardless of whether the $SPY, $QQQ, $DIA gap down on Monday or not, I expect we're going to see a multi-week explosive rally going into May.  $AAPL, #FANG stocks are all forming inverted head & shoulders patterns. If $AAPL didn't already bottom on Friday, it prob. does M/Tu.
1706 2018-04-07 18:54:57 Last year GOP passed their tax cuts.

Trump promised “rocket fuel” for the economy.

Anemic jobs report, YTD stocks are down, worst Q2 since the Depression.

Rocket fuel.
1707 2018-04-07 18:53:18 @POTUS STOCKS:   A little pain   You're a BILLIONAIRE.   I'll be living out of my CAR
1708 2018-04-07 18:52:21 $LFIN - brokers will charge a borrow fee even on halted stocks though, so if you exercise and are short, you will pay for the borrow even if its halted. 7/x
1709 2018-04-07 18:52:14 Yes, they are and that's why people don't leave all their money in any kind of stocks or mutual funds anymore. Better to have some in a high-yield savings account.
1710 2018-04-07 18:51:57 Frankly speaking the stocks i sold had gone to become multibaggers 
1711 2018-04-07 18:50:21 Three dead in deadly assault van attack in Germany. No word if it has “bump shocks” similar to the bump stocks on the other inanimate assault weapon.

1716 2018-04-07 18:49:04 The Trump organisation will be buying stocks low, then he’ll pull back in the tarrifs, stocks will rise, he’ll make millions.
1717 2018-04-07 18:48:39 Best piece of investment advice you’ll ever receive is to pay yourself first when that paycheck comes in. 10% into a stocks and shares ISA every month. So important to diversify your holdings- don’t make the mistake of only saving cash, one word: inflation.
1718 2018-04-07 18:48:33 I’ll do so to you as I have to Harwood. Repeatedly. Simple answer was rock bottom interest rates under Obama. It’s called interest arbitrage:  purchase fixed income securities and earn next to nothing of stocks. The economy was poor over all eight years. Today is real growth.
1719 2018-04-07 18:48:00 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
1720 2018-04-07 18:46:33 Nope, wouldn't find any soldier carrying that weapon on a battlefield. Each shot requires pulling the trigger, even with a bump stock, requires continuous triggering. (BTW totally against bump stocks)
1721 2018-04-07 18:46:29 Was talking about stocks w my dad the other day and he said everything’s dropping cus “trump and the other fat ass keep messing around” in chinese

1723 2018-04-07 18:45:08 Dry Ginger Crop-Nigeria, Mar 2018, Carry forward stocks and less demand from exporters were the main reasons for price reduction
1724 2018-04-07 18:44:57 How to not lose money in stock? Don't sell when stocks drop! (duh) Don't worry, #MAGA is @POTUS goal and passion for US.
1725 2018-04-07 18:44:37 Xiaomi phones are out of stocks very qickly pls do some major steps for your phone units #request
1726 2018-04-07 18:44:30 Again, nobody is saying not to invest in stocks. We are saying to promote policies that raise wages rather than inflate assets into bubbles with periodic crashes. In other words, don’t govern by the Dow when the majority of Americans don’t have stocks to begin with.
1727 2018-04-07 18:42:21 Monday, Monday. Please do not buy any stocks at the open on Monday. There is more cold winter for stocks here before spring, ( and earnings) , finally arrive. Beware!
1728 2018-04-07 18:42:19 As per Graham  calculations many Kuwaiti stocks are over priced
1729 2018-04-07 18:41:18 I gather from your statement you are talking about a ban on bump stocks,  not the semi-auto rifles. The problem I see with banning things is that they tend to go underground & people obtain them illegally if they really want them. Prohibition of alcohol and abortion come to mind.
1730 2018-04-07 18:41:18 Israel has extensive stocks of chemical weapons & refused to declare any of them to the OPCW. Israel is not a member of the OPCW. Israel signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993 but refused to ratify as this would mean inspection & destruction of its chemical weapons.
1731 2018-04-07 18:41:11 Many (most?) people's 401(k) aren't invested enough into the specific stocks listed on the Dow, Nasdaq, or S&P to see much of a change either way based on what the markets are doing.  Even Dow up 50% wouldn't make their 401(k) leap similarly.
1732 2018-04-07 18:40:53 move to stocks where dividends will be rising faster than land.

Selling UBI on it's merits is a half hearted exercise. Sell UBI as the only realistic mechanism to reverse income inequality, PLUS, look what good things happen if you get a UBI. We are literally at war, a war 3/4

As horrific as Las Vegas was, it's a true outline in terms of no known motivation, use of bump stocks, use of multiple rifles, his attempt to purchase tracers.  P2

Midwestern farmers have already begun crying FOUL as product stocks go haywire. #MAGA may finally meet its judgement!
1739 2018-04-07 18:35:51 MRF, Page & BajFin provided the market remains open and investors chase these stocks.
1740 2018-04-07 18:34:17 Oh for sure. Basically the only chance is between stocks or if someone gets a grab then holds it. 

OW is so interesting. It's been sucking up a lot of my spare time lately. I heard a rumor that new Xanadu might be looking to do OW which I would be down to cast (poorly)
1741 2018-04-07 18:34:12 *only* reason?  Question from one CFA to another, pls:  w/out QE & ZIRP, where should stocks have gone given SPX earnings preGFC/Oct07 were ~$55 and they’re in $130s today?  (Fairly confident on those #s but not positive...)

1760 2018-04-07 18:17:16 VIEW:
1) Need to increase number of stocks below 200dma without larger drop in indices. Look for rotation so damage gets spread wider
2) More chop at or below current levels till 1 is accomplished 
3) Divergence between index and ADLINE to widen till 1 I’d done

You need a good financial adviser.  I've got a good one, would be happy to share his name.
1785 2018-04-07 18:01:12 Unfortunately the man is clueless!! Or possibly he's just lining his own pockets via the stock market. When he opens his mouth & the market plummets, maybe his stock broker buys up stocks while prices are low. Maybe then sells when market recovers. Should look into this.
1786 2018-04-07 18:00:50 I describe myself as liberal, progressive and green. And I vote Democrat.

1787 2018-04-07 18:00:00 @SavannahGuthrie at some point stocks need to fall just a little more

1793 2018-04-07 17:56:07 Both risk-on assets, and coorelation has been higher over the last year than it has been in the past. Also, the rise of bitcoin propelled semi co.s like $NVDA higher .. if crypto crashes, those stocks feel extra pressure.. when bitcoin rises, they rise more than others

1795 2018-04-07 17:54:32 Across the world public health care systems are a complete disaster.

1807 2018-04-07 17:44:52 @stopthenutjob I wish I had bump stocks in many guns too bad I can't buy them I probably never would except now bunch of liberal assholes make it well I should say it could never take a life but these Looney's could
1808 2018-04-07 17:44:15 Specific rifles and bump stocks, yes. Sorry, not sorry.

1811 2018-04-07 17:42:58 Set an ema at 314

314 is an important well back tested moving average for gauging cycle changes in stocks.

The markets have held them so far. Until broken I'd assume sideways to up from here.

Your trendline is important bc it's a rate of change that has held for over 2 yrs
1812 2018-04-07 17:42:55 I'm a novice on stocks. All I know is to look at the 1, 3, 5-year trends and lifetime to see how it's performed. Also Google their information and their outlooks on revenues. Then buy. You're betting on it.

1816 2018-04-07 17:39:46 Worst Financial move of the year would be to sell #cryptocurrency to pay taxes. Better off selling stock, by far. Stocks, at this point, will not go UP 5x, but, crypto will, and, 3x(Alts), is conservative. 10x, 20x, 50x, all very possible.
1817 2018-04-07 17:39:31 So, Robinhood allows you to buy individual stocks, commission free, up to $5000 in a time frame (I forget if it's a week or month). You transfer money and then buy the stocks. Watch them grow or whatnot.

1821 2018-04-07 17:36:56 So the department off justice is working on a bill to ban bump stocks . Even though the atf deemed them legal all the way back in 2010 . Now everyone that has a $300.00 bump stock will have to destroy them with no reparations , meaning they won’t refund our money.
1822 2018-04-07 17:36:21 I can't do trading. So I do timepass with few stocks with 15% of my capital. This time it's star paper. Cheapest paper stock. Buy 1K at 200 sell in uptrend. Done cycling 3 times. Waiting for results. If they are good then will book profit and find some other stock.
1823 2018-04-07 17:36:06 I vaguely remember seeing a tweet where he said a potus should quit if stocks dropped. That would be a good one to retweet.

1829 2018-04-07 17:31:42 Bump stocks are not enough.
1830 2018-04-07 17:30:12 America there's a whole "gun culture" which is out of control, with unsupervised private sales, military grade weapons in civilian hands, insufficient background checks, bump stocks, etc. I always advocate for moderate solutions, IMO 2A just needs proper regulation.
1831 2018-04-07 17:28:59 Basically, it's a way to buy stocks. They don't charge commissions. It's pretty dope and if you use my link, you'll get a free share of something just for having an account approved.
1832 2018-04-07 17:28:46 History has recorded the “Great Recession” as starting in 2007. Remember: RE bubble-inflate actual values for sales, 06’, Mortgages/banking,....weapons of mass destruction....Halliburton stocks. Bush meeting w McCain+Obama...to explain the imminent financial crisis.
1833 2018-04-07 17:25:47 Can you point me to a handgun with equal ROF as an AK-47? "Will kill" is hyperbolic; not too many bump stocks or drum mags available for a Glock 9.
1834 2018-04-07 17:24:53 for the most part stocks typically fade bc there's "less" demand relative supply. thats why most all day faders happen on 70-80% less volume than on their up days. Only time u see faders on massive red volume is when 1) dilution 2) massive holder(s) unloading
1835 2018-04-07 17:24:32 I don't purchase those stocks which give me sleepless nights!

1838 2018-04-07 17:23:47 True, but find myself thinking of time arbitrage. Short-term put premiums often attractively priced. Many long-term stocks (hold them minimum of three to five years) are reasonably valued. #cashsecuredputwrite

1841 2018-04-07 17:20:07 I've long been of the opinion that the combination of robo advisors, ETFs, and passive investing might create pricing inefficiency for large cap US stocks.

1919 2018-04-07 16:23:46 The article misses some points. 1) The students are not trying to TAKE guns or laws AWAY from Americans, they want assault rifles/ext mags/bump stocks banned.  2) The study just mentions legal guns as a whole, but there's differences between defending & a massacre & illegal guns.

1930 2018-04-07 16:19:56 That just means stock process have gone down and he can buy stocks cheap, that way when the next president fixes it, all his low cost stocks will make a nice profit
1931 2018-04-07 16:19:34 They have no idea what money is. They seem to think Stocks are money, Fixed income, and so many other things. The main reason is that Money has lost a major primary quality "Store of Value."  Bad money is at the core of our society's decay. It creates much "unfairness."
1932 2018-04-07 16:19:18 Even bigger than that imho. Global QE and ZIRP only reason stocks are where they are. Like any Ponzi scheme, unless the inflows keep coming in / rise, i.e. don't stop or fall (QT), it collapses.
1933 2018-04-07 16:19:14 I take it you don't like short plays it is all about dollars I doubt many want a company to fail
1934 2018-04-07 16:19:10 Gasa I hate when ole stocks try and come back in my life ... try n make a Round deh boss man
1935 2018-04-07 16:18:09 I know that Gary, it’s an Armalite 15. I don’t think we need bump stocks though, that change them into automatic rifles. I’m not anti NRA either. Just wish there was an easy answer to all this.
1936 2018-04-07 16:17:55 Look up what stocks were in 2016. Msft was in $65 range and Apple around $96. I can’t find what Dow was in 2016 but the market had lost 300? Pts. POTUS gives us hope. The jobs are there you just need to train for those jobs.
1937 2018-04-07 16:17:31 #stocks Who are you kidding? Charts, algorithms, and indicators are nothing without the human element. That’s the #FlingTrade strategy
1938 2018-04-07 16:17:13 "Don't overreact," President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser told investors on Wednesday, when U.S. stocks were deep in the red over worries about the administration's plan for $50 billion of import duties aimed at China.
1939 2018-04-07 16:16:46 Yes thank you @POTUS for making my retirement account less stable, the world less safe, doing nothing about mass shootings and nothing about the threats to democracy. Can’t even trust you with my daughter. #maga #NeverAgain #RussianMeddling #metoo #stocks
1940 2018-04-07 16:16:22 I will never buy from these pathetic & political companies! I urge all those who have stocks or 401K or even mutual funds to pull out from these pathetic corporate bullies! 
How can you justify empowering these monsters financially. They are a real threat to our freedoms!
1941 2018-04-07 16:16:21 I’ve absolutely loved this season!! The teams been outstanding! You’ve done well to get where you are and I couldn’t be anymore happier. Have a good summer and hopefully see you next season! @FifeFlyers @nucci39 @elcreido18 @C_Schaber @A_Iles33 @RussMoyer @Stocks_68

1943 2018-04-07 16:13:51 Why would I bash the stocks you’re in, when I know nothing about most of them? Even if I did, I still wouldn’t go there.
1944 2018-04-07 16:13:45 #stocks Ok, so I don’t like day trading, and rarely do I make great trades on the long side. So that’s why I developed the #FlingTrade strategy
1945 2018-04-07 16:11:54 This is what I was trying to get at. Don't want to bug anyones' nerves, but they shouldnt be bugged at the first point of dissent. Feel free to 'bash' the stocks I tout (generally speaking to all)
1946 2018-04-07 16:11:47 6) Stocks rebound. Shorts get squeezed
7) Market: See? Fed is talking up the market. Fed put!!!
8) Shorts: why do they have to manipulate the market like that?

This is how ppl come away with an exaggerated view of Fed put
1947 2018-04-07 16:11:00 That shit a scam yo.

1955 2018-04-07 16:08:17 All 3 stocks helped a lot of people make a lot of money at some point in the past....but they also make a lot of people lose a lot of money... You may classify them as P&D but I don't really care....I only care about making money...
1956 2018-04-07 16:07:51 I wonder if the friends are trading stocks with a heads up from him.

1980 2018-04-07 15:50:07 Investing in what? Every asset class is overpriced and stocks' recent downtrend reflects that
1981 2018-04-07 15:50:00 Do u wonder why Trump doesn’t show his financials? Now; while he starts a trade war, bad mouths Amazon & others his spiderweb of corporations buy their stocks up. Hmm.. then he will flip on the trade war, speak well of those previously “bad” companies & make tons of $$$. #conman
1982 2018-04-07 15:49:38 No one is trying to take all the guns away, only guns like AR15s and bump stocks.

1987 2018-04-07 15:48:28 This is my page to post all trades. Mainly trading small cap momentum stocks. Starting off with $1,000 account. Let see what happens!
1988 2018-04-07 15:47:46 I’ve worked in print for 30+ years now and I still blank on remembering paper stocks and weights by name/number. Maybe a list of popular comics for punters to say “I want that one” would be handy

1990 2018-04-07 15:46:56 Once I made my money back am out of the OTC pink sheet stocks. Seems they're all scams. ARYC,ONCI,just to mention a few.
1991 2018-04-07 15:46:42 Fuck you Trump stocks have been so plummeting for weeks now 
1992 2018-04-07 15:45:09 So what sensible gun laws did Florida pass?  Changing the age to by a long gun to 21?  Most of the shootings are done by people over 21. Made bump stocks illegal?  The only time that was used was in Vegas.  A waiting period? If a person has I'll intentions will that matter?
1993 2018-04-07 15:45:05 OMG it drives me insane - it's like why do folks in Crypto do this? People don't tell you how much they have in stocks????
1994 2018-04-07 15:43:37 @amjoyshow what do you think of  the rumor that Trump has minions buying up stocks that are devalued as a result of the trade war  and will then recant and make millions when the prices rise?
1995 2018-04-07 15:43:26 He does!! He knows all it takes is for him to tweet about something and the stocks follow his lead like a hungry puppy...
1996 2018-04-07 15:42:53 1933 when stocks were rock bottom in oil and gas. Then 1979 for the PC boom. Then 1993 for the dot com boom
1997 2018-04-07 15:42:11 Not to mention when we buy stocks in our portfolio the intention is always to hold for ever. Right now all are hold ever for me
1998 2018-04-07 15:41:43 If you start too low, you may not be able to grow!

2001 2018-04-07 15:40:02 It actually does. I believe in the right to bear arms, though I don’t intend to. I don’t think we need military style guns or bump stocks.
2002 2018-04-07 15:39:52 Why did president Obama pardon drug dealers????????? Why didn’t president Obama eradicate illegal drugs?????????? Why did president Obama legalize Bumb stocks?????????? Why did president Obama sell automatic weapons to Mexicans drug cartels????????? WHY?????
2003 2018-04-07 15:39:24 You can read about some good screening methods/criteria in Andreas Clenow’s book “Stocks on the Move”.
2004 2018-04-07 15:39:18 Would it bother her that much, as long as she has advance warning so she's got time to suggest Philip buys up stocks in second-hand camouflaged Land-Rovers & dodgy khaki body armour?
2005 2018-04-07 15:39:11 I went to B&M earlier and couldn’t find any stocks of that chicken gravy
2006 2018-04-07 15:39:07 Our current reality wouldn't exist if that mattered.
Mass shooters DO NOT purchase weapons in full auto through ATF.
Converting semi auto to full auto, or using bump stocks, much simpler.
Full auto,w/ extended clips and or/many clips.
That's the reality.
 End of story.
2007 2018-04-07 15:36:42 You’re not paying attention. Stocks crashed again, trade wars prices will go up, jobs ARE down, yesterday’s report. How about the 1.5 trillion deficit?

2015 2018-04-07 15:31:07 Military grade weapons, bump stocks etc are not protected by 2A. This was already decided back when they were banned before. This is not a constitutional issue.
2016 2018-04-07 15:30:16 Yey malapit na irelease sa pinas yung stocks nila.
2017 2018-04-07 15:29:57 thank you John. $9k in the bank last week, getting closer. After wasting a year on NAK it feels good. No more story stocks for me, no emotion, just good trading.
2018 2018-04-07 15:29:38 I've bought on ramps before and am now cynical/wary I'm afraid... Very careful who I listen to on Twitter.  Stocks I like usually go on a watchlist with many others. I then wait for one to offer a great  price. Placings mean placing price to me unless it's truly exceptional.
2019 2018-04-07 15:29:18 どっち転んでもちょっと悲しかったわ
2020 2018-04-07 15:28:26 I agree that's a problem, but the only way to persuade them otherwise... is to persuade them otherwise.
In any case market force applies for retailers - I'll buy from whoever stocks what I want, so those not stocking it lose the sale.  And maybe further sales.
2021 2018-04-07 15:25:54 In this fast forward changing business cycles no company is immune to collapse. But considering INDIA growth story I believe there are so many stocks can hold for next 10,20 30 years

2023 2018-04-07 15:25:29 When former & current bond kings start calling for major equity declines, then you can be sure the opposite will occur. They are terrific bond investors but mostly clueless about stocks. History has proven it over and over. #Ignorethenoise
2024 2018-04-07 15:25:23 Assault weapons are not protected by 2A so there is absolutely no constitutional reason not to ban them. Same with extended clips & bump stocks. Per the Supreme Court. Appreciate & admire your service, regardless of of difference on facts, however.

2039 2018-04-07 15:18:09 I can see the end of the 3 month consolidation this week, following the markets reaction to the fuzzymentals on Friday, Gold looking good on all charts, and with Stocks and D/yen looking bearish I think we will see a good run up, I watched your Collide video too, very interesting
2040 2018-04-07 15:18:00 So capital flows will make stocks go up and real estate - just like the last 4+ years. How is capital flow going to translate into inflation that will spook the fed?
2041 2018-04-07 15:17:59 I'd like the SEC to investigate if Trump's late night calls to friends net them millions by shorting stocks? And his family? Possible insider trading.
2042 2018-04-07 15:17:32 Stocks that were featured used to get a “Barron’s Bump” on Monday. You don’t see that very much anymore. Due to the decrease in quality and influence
2043 2018-04-07 15:16:34 Can CNN verify a post that says Trump associates are buying stocks when Trump's comments drive them down, selling when up, making billions? Sounds credible to me.
2044 2018-04-07 15:15:57 Thank you for making stocks affordable again. #MAGA
2045 2018-04-07 15:15:39 Been saying for weeks - I wonder how many of Trump's late night calls to friends net them millions shorting stocks? Something for the SEC to ponder.
2046 2018-04-07 15:13:24 Random stock tip. Not #FakeNews! Time to consider selling Rexnord $RXN #Stocks
2047 2018-04-07 15:09:18 Not bullish as such...what i meant was they are in control so they will promote it (just like stocks) while they suppress the real (like gold/silver)
2048 2018-04-07 15:08:39 Also a great time to go on Etrade & get some bargain stocks now that Trump has tanked the market!

2055 2018-04-07 15:03:09 These placing stocks always get heavy ramp promotion by the same people to help shift the stock onto PI's.... That does not mean that every placing is bad, thats where investors have to make a distinction and ignore any hyperbole.
2056 2018-04-07 15:02:33 I was a fan of the Brady Bill and wish it were back in play. Manufacturers ran amok with collapsible stocks, high capacity mags, shorter barrels and making traditionally rifle platforms into “pistol” platforms.
2057 2018-04-07 15:01:28 Seeing a lot of stores holding a buy1 take1 promo, happy hour starting at 1pm, popular  establishments offering 20% off like army navy and 711 stores with no products para lang maubos stocks nila before yung pagsara sa Boracay on April 26 is such a sad thing.
2058 2018-04-07 15:00:25 I don’t invest in stocks long or short. I comment on frauds. Good luck with your trades and all the best.

2070 2018-04-07 14:55:07 That’s actually not true. We, as citizens, always have the right to create change. We can fix problems that our founding fathers couldn’t possible account for. Like telecommunications and cyber security. AR-15s and bump stocks. Comprehensive background checks. Waiting periods...
2071 2018-04-07 14:52:59 I don’t like buying bottoming stocks. Plus science wise still I’m not sold, yet. Maybe soon but have to be in on their science and show me the benefits and so far I haven’t seen it.

2080 2018-04-07 14:46:16 Yes @trickmitch1 is for big cap stocks, and @TSXtrad3r is for penny stocks. Glad I know about both!
2081 2018-04-07 14:46:15 As you well know Paul this was sitting 30p to 40p and then dropped (along with a lot of AIM resource stocks) so looking at paper losses is so frustrating - AIM thrives on good frequent news flow - if this can bounce back (100%needed) to where a lot of investors are in be a start

2083 2018-04-07 14:44:08 He's obviously exaggerating but I don't feel that the market is truly reflecting the overall level of fear at the moment. It feels like 2008 with people ready to sell off their stocks at the next big news event.
2084 2018-04-07 14:44:00 At some point big money figures out that it is the proverbial "sucker at the table" by holding sovereign debt through all of this; when they do, the only asset market big enough for them to run to are stocks.  LT Breakout in SPX/TLT suggests this process has already started...

2100 2018-04-07 14:28:40 In my opinion it’s sometimes easier to avoid a market downturn by owning fewer stocks, or a single stock, rather than a basket of stocks. The company I mentioned has everything in its own hands. Just needs to increase sales to existing customers to significantly increase value.
2101 2018-04-07 14:27:49 Parfait alors, ne traines pas trop à acheter Billy Bat aussi, à mon avis dans un an il y aura des trous car Pika ne fait jamais trainer ses stocks de séries finies malheureusement :/
2102 2018-04-07 14:26:32 Don't you think all these stocks crash hard in the summer? If Canopy sell 400 million revenue and nets 30% they're worth about $12-15 at a 20-25 PE

2112 2018-04-07 14:18:03 You don’t need a book about how it relates to you, the market is a tool to make income. You need to know the diff types of income that can be made (stocks, options, shorts) all the markets provide is income or debt. That’s where it effects gas in your car. I was serious about it
2113 2018-04-07 14:17:47 There's something wrong with me, I guess. I don't blame the AR-15. In fact, I keep thinking about how much they will be worth if they are banned. Price goes up, DOW sinks, investment in guns is more stable than stocks? I dunno.
2114 2018-04-07 14:16:13 What is your strong suspicion. Stocks up or down ?
2115 2018-04-07 14:15:58 @realDonaldTrump Remember!

2116 2018-04-07 14:15:48 As I've said many times, usually to great disagreement, U.S. agriculture would be better served  (served at all?) if USDA quit releasing guesses about production, demand, etc. and instead focused more on data-driven reports (exports sales and shipments, stocks on hand, etc.).

2120 2018-04-07 14:12:53 The article from 2013 you refer to made some basic assumptions but you omit it claimed #bitcoin a bubble which proved to be as wrong then as now. Altcoins offer different utility & valued against btc (just like stocks which are all valued to usd etc.) Making btc a store of value.
2121 2018-04-07 14:11:53 I'm a fan of all the current Leffe beers. I save my stocks of the Ruby for having with curry. If I could get it regularly, I'd drink more Leffe Nectar, or Leffe Radieuse. However, not even the beer warehouse in Belgium I tend to buy from can ever guarantee having these in stock.
2122 2018-04-07 14:10:51 On the global front, Asian stocks will on Monday, 9 April 2018, react to  the US nonfarm payrolls data and US unemployment rate data for March  2018 which will be unveiled on Friday, 6 April 2018.
2123 2018-04-07 14:10:10 @jimcramer Can we still get the Stocks and Bonds or Acquirer Board games? Do they have updated versions of them, e.g. with current Stock/Company names? Good Idea IMHO - What do you think? Thank you, Jim! Love @MadMoney!

2133 2018-04-07 14:07:10 There must be a method to his madness. Carl Icahn benefitted greatly selling off stocks after a meeting with Trump before the first plunge. I wonder who benefitted from big stock sell offs before these recent drops. Hmmmm?

2135 2018-04-07 14:05:14 Stocks rose because of the foundation established by President Obama. Racist Trump hates Obama and claimed the Market rise but it is the loss of confidence and unstable policies and statements by a sick bully @realDonaldTrump that is wrecking world markets and world peace.

2141 2018-04-07 14:01:34 In higher numbers here, yes. You're being rather anecdotal.

2144 2018-04-07 14:00:04 Yes. Thanks for making stocks cheaper (DOW down 572/2.3%). Thank you for making it harder to sell to China. Thank you for Scott Pruitt.

2155 2018-04-07 13:53:41 I put some in stocks 2 years ago but not touching it and hopefully it will be ok. I held back too because I knew we’d be on a rollercoaster with Trump.
2156 2018-04-07 13:51:27 This is the dude who's still looking for WMDs' in Iraq.  It's because of his stupidity, that our Security Services integrity has been a laughing stock. Now, he's suggesting that our Brexit voters be treated by Germany as laughing stocks

2160 2018-04-07 13:49:49 @midcap_mantra @salildhawan @FI_InvestIndia @dmuthuk Buying in market correction works better than stock SIP for my portfolio. Even in 3-5% correction I bought small amount of my preferred stocks. Some QUALITY stocks, like Maruti, also give at least 2 opportunities in a year.
2161 2018-04-07 13:47:30 Yeah plus the immutability aspect, like if you lose your keys do you lose your stocks?
2162 2018-04-07 13:46:41 this shows what the process was about. That 10 win team had some of the worst players ever and made them laughing stocks. Look at them now.

2190 2018-04-07 13:28:24 Analyze price action of stocks and notice the only ways things go up is either by gapping or in one big ass candle/move where no one can get in because no decent pullback. Im talking in general across the whole market. Its DESIGNED to be a SELLING GAME.
2191 2018-04-07 13:28:00 Thanks genius. I was unaware how stocks work. And the market was 18000'ish when Trump took office now even with a slight chevron 23000'ish. So a gain.
2192 2018-04-07 13:27:54 In the 3 months trying to day trade my IRA what I have found is less is more. For me no company stocks. Stick to oil, gold, gas and volatility (up and down). Mostly 3x etfs. I am basically gambling right now and trying to learn along the way.

2205 2018-04-07 13:21:39 Big difference between personal and corporate taxes. Dems did not want to lower taxes on corporations many of which already paid minimal taxes . These corporations are not passing their taxe breaks to their employees but buying their stocks back as Trump said

2220 2018-04-07 13:14:29 1/ Yesterday's discussion with @giookro has motivated me to look for evidence that various momentum signals could serve as a buy signal for various 'deep value' stocks. To test this, I tried a couple of simple backtests.
2221 2018-04-07 13:14:06 I am doing an acid test. 
Have never felt better. 
Will not touch my stocks till the next 90 days.
2222 2018-04-07 13:13:58 Fundamentally though, both are soundly based. I'd see superior alts for either of them, both mid/long bearish... no.  

Perhaps agreeing on 'garbage stocks' is even more difficult than on quality. Anyway, suggestions always welcome.
2223 2018-04-07 13:13:49 No, not that one.
2224 2018-04-07 13:13:48 Agree, definitely want to hold a good chunk of cash, but see more and more stocks getting to cheap levels, so hard to resist.   On the other hand, may get a lot better values still - tricky market

2227 2018-04-07 13:12:04 True. But people buy stocks with much more background check and risk calculation. Today, people are buying bitcoin because of the hype. Only few people know how cryptocurrencies actually work. That's foolish.
2228 2018-04-07 13:11:56 I never said I was not against further gun control such as further background checks, banning bump stocks, violent felons not owning guns.

2238 2018-04-07 13:05:20 $LFIN If i continued stocks with a 10K account...good chance I could have got fucked too. You really need at least 50K to have a chance in stocks.... otherwise you get tempted to go long and eventually....THIS HAPPENS.
2239 2018-04-07 13:03:29 Market Facts

I have observed that whenever the market corrects or falls, investors are often discouraged by the news channel panels to buy the stocks. Whereas, the best time to buy the quality companies is when the market falls apart.
2240 2018-04-07 13:02:11 I only buy stocks which I am willing to hold even if stock market is closed for next 10-20  year's
2241 2018-04-07 13:01:56 $LFIN Stocks - Halts, shitty borrows unless you have 50K and are with a "decent" broker, scammy spread which widens whenever you want to bounce it, opportunity window is TINY compared to other instruments, difficult to scale in with non-scaleable commission structure unlike Fx.
2242 2018-04-07 13:01:15 That's only because people are fearing and he's gone after Amazon stocks going to remain the same and keep going up relax
2243 2018-04-07 13:00:50 Yeah maybe you need to come back to reality I'm sure you look at your 401k or your stocks and you'll see that they have gone up considerably I'm sure you're not bitching about that

2249 2018-04-07 12:57:39 just checked in on twitter and saw the $LFIN mess. Again... another reason why i trade Fx and indices now. With stocks...yes fast profits... but look how many factors of disaster you are surrounded with. Is the faster profit POTENTIAL really worth it?
2250 2018-04-07 12:56:55 When the @brucefenton “stocks should be tokens” tweet thread turned into a ravencoin pump it was a helpful reminder that most scammers hide in plain sight.  Also discovered ravencoin doesn’t even have tokens yet...

2266 2018-04-07 12:47:37 All stocks have limits and must bubble which is the precursor to the bubble premise and the IPO which is acceptable as public funding sources under the federal Reserve which regulates under interest rates adjustments
2267 2018-04-07 12:46:32 For sure, hard to say for sure but I think markets would have settled down some without the tariff talk. I do think we probably just need to trade sideways a few months to let fundamentals catch up to stocks, so that is part of it. Fears of Fed selling assets doesn’t help.
2268 2018-04-07 12:46:20 Since Trump lobbed the first volley in this war of words and tariffs on March 1, the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks has fallen around 4%. Based on the market value of all domestic equities, that works out to around $1.2 trillion in lost stock market wealth. “How’s your 401k doing?”

2285 2018-04-07 12:30:44 It happens with stocks on a regular basis. But,  for some reason, people who buy real estate believe that it goes up forever. 
2286 2018-04-07 12:30:18 I personally don't see Gold or other precious metals as investments. Gold doesn't earn anything - ever. You just have to hope that someone will buy it from you for more money in future. Stocks, on the other hand, are investments in productive assets. Companies earn money.

2288 2018-04-07 12:29:32 I never trade single stocks anymore for that exact reason. I stick with ETFs, mainly SPY, QQQ, GLD, TLT, FXI, FXE, IYR, XOP, etc. I know Tastytrade theory says we should be indifferent to underlyings, but there was always at least one single stock that killed me. So never again.

2290 2018-04-07 12:27:15 I don't pay attention but I know my dad's retirement was all 401K and company stocks, he had heart attack at 60, was offered early retirement, couldn't get health insurance, great recession happened, was spectacularly stressful.
2291 2018-04-07 12:26:58 I hope these are a hit so my stocks can take off!
2292 2018-04-07 12:25:38 Stocks usually have underlying assets and cashflows behind them, unlike bitcoin which is just made up

2296 2018-04-07 12:23:05 Agreed. A good process is key. Simply buying 5 stocks with the highest p/e, the lowest momentum, and the weakest quality will provide an active share of 99%. But it sux!
2297 2018-04-07 12:22:42 I would imagine they are now shorting stocks since Dotard is manipulating the market.

2300 2018-04-07 12:20:35 We are doing well - seeing a lot less volatility in the more value-oriented stocks I usually buy than the general market and still making money this year.

2301 2018-04-07 12:20:16 Pls stocks took off almost for a year and a half .  Cry me a river , where you crying when banks loaned your money without making a return ? Were you crying about escalating HEAlthcare and taxes under democrats ?
2302 2018-04-07 12:19:10 The value of stocks is supposed to equal the discounted sum of future cash flows. Bitcoin has no underlying value.

2308 2018-04-07 12:15:40 Not all stocks pay dividends
2309 2018-04-07 12:13:40 I'm no expert but stocks, like investments, also provide a dividend in addition to increasing in value... so no, not the same thing. But I could be wrong.
2310 2018-04-07 12:13:21 Ok people are fool because they buy Bitcoin on the expectations about rising prices irrespective of its actual worth but what about stocks.dont they buy it for the same reason instead of getting dividend.
2311 2018-04-07 12:11:13 I'm sure he did. He offload, then speaks derogatory,  then buys & makes millions. He is using the WH to manipulate the stocks.

2325 2018-04-07 12:01:21 3. Of all those who have made it previously Russia was the most likely source for his attack. We did make allowance that old stocks may have fallen into other hands - that was what the PM invited Russia to explain , they haven’t done that , so we hold them responsible.
2326 2018-04-07 12:00:46 Yeah, kind of odd that the stocks drop significantly, then rise up again just to drop again. Who's making money here is who we  should be concerned with. I wouldn't doubt if he's trying to sell off this country to Putin. ISIS, N. Korea, all a setup if you ask me.

2333 2018-04-07 11:52:01 The NRA is indeed covered in blood.  When you oppose any change related to guns, u are a part of the problem. Bump stocks are a perfect example- why do people need bump stocks?  They make a semiautomatic more like an automatic.  Yet the NRA opposes getting rid of them.
2334 2018-04-07 11:51:18 Wondering around a struggling furniture store in Cambridge that pretty much exclusively stocks enormous recliner-style sofas. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to them that they’re surrounded by houses that are nowhere near big enough for the things they’re trying to sell.

2337 2018-04-07 11:42:56 That is absolutely misleading & deviation from actual reason of price crash, yes production is near to fulfill domestic demand, excessive imports which resulted surplus stocks.

2343 2018-04-07 11:29:07 They will just buy up cheap stocks and wait.
2344 2018-04-07 11:28:54 So you think stocks should only always go up?  Kinda like a pyramid scheme?
2345 2018-04-07 11:25:16 You’re right about it being the government. Not the EU. EU quotas have allowed stocks to recover. UK government sells those quotas to a few large companies, screwing small fishing crews.

2354 2018-04-07 11:06:50 Anyway... the Syrian stocks of Sarin were destroyed by an international entity and witnessed by observers, there were stocks of WMD in Libya which during the Hillary Clinton tenure were in the hands of the terrorists she installed inside Libya NOT Syria.
2355 2018-04-07 11:05:26 On a side note: if you listen to @StocksToTrade steady trade podcast episode with Huddie. I believe he mentions that once he researches stocks that follow certain setups from trading tickers..he will rewatch those chapter(s) in prep for the next day. Great advice from him.

2365 2018-04-07 10:51:33 Trading tickers chapters on OTC multiday breakouts and the one on listed stocks is solid. I recommend being long bias until you pass pdt. I've watched all of tim's dvds at least once. PS part deux 4 times, framework (twice), sec filings (twice), tickers (twice). It has helped me
2366 2018-04-07 10:50:30 Kind of interesting that the number of stocks skews away from high liquidity bucket in micro and away from low liquidity in large. Wonder what’s driving that?

2371 2018-04-07 10:41:36 This is Trump’s SOP for years. In NYC and elsewhere he always had the high ground. China will not roll over to him and as stocks continue to tank he will deal more heat from his billionaire buddies. Then he will look for an exit and declare he won.

2386 2018-04-07 10:17:32 The dow Jones, the s&p 500 and the nasdaq all fell more than 2 percent. The prospect of a rising trade war is likely to trigger a major correction in U.S. stocks.

2408 2018-04-07 09:47:28 .As usual, Prescott doesn’t know what he is talking about.  It was actually the CFP which caused the reduction in fish stocks by allowing Spanish trawlers to fish younger fish thus not allowing fish stocks to either maintain or even increase through reproduction!!!

A "great business man" would be able to make a company that makes him more money than just sitting on said money in stocks for 30 yrs.

2438 2018-04-07 08:51:50 @dneilmckay if trade war escalates, what if Trump forces China to levy export restrictions, say phones and clothing...ouch! Not only it will drop stocks like Apple and Amazon, cause people lose their 401k, it will increase prices on everyday products.
2439 2018-04-07 08:50:13 It's definitely entertaining. Players in grand finals just rushing off stage, edgeguarding so hard that they kill themselves and don't take stocks.
2440 2018-04-07 08:49:31 Wowww. Tell that to all the costal towns and once great holiday places destroyed by the restrictions on fishing and the open waters to others to help deplete fishing stocks. Tell that to all the generations of fish g families that now struggle to make a living
2441 2018-04-07 08:49:01 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  I’d pay more in products from China if it takes us to be anywhere where we are now. You’re doing good. Plus I’m buying stocks that are dropping.

2495 2018-04-07 07:30:32 1987, in context, was a small hiccup. Look back at a long-term chart of US stocks and 1987 is barely noticeable. And in any case the first nine months of that year were hugely positive - overall, it was an 'up' year. Perspective.

2535 2018-04-07 06:53:52 If "it's leading until it isn't" is another way of saying it's not really correlated, I agree.  

Unfortunately, the difference between the double-bottoms in stocks and Bitcoin is that the stock market is not (yet) in a bear market.
2536 2018-04-07 06:53:17 pistol grips and thumbhole stocks are ergonomic in function. and barrel shrouds perform the same action as regular wooden stock on a hunting rifle.
2537 2018-04-07 06:52:11 the ar-15 is not used by the military nor is it dangerous and unusual. it is merely a modular modern semi-automatic rifle. with lots of interchangeable parts for easy repair and customization.. telescoping stocks are in the same leage as adjustable seats.

2574 2018-04-07 06:03:04 Does Trump not give a crap what happens to stocks because he's not allowed to own any now that he's president?  You all know his ego is probably capable of feeling this way.  Shit, what a huckster this guy has been since his state of the ruinion speech.  Asshole.

2588 2018-04-07 05:33:53 The AR-15 is designed to kill people; lots of them. With bump stocks it's practically auto.  High capacity mags are available . Why does the public need to have access to this?

2592 2018-04-07 05:31:36 @VirgilGreen I've seen stocks go to cash value many times. $QD has $4.00 a share in cash. Highly unlikely it goes below cash value. enjoy
2593 2018-04-07 05:30:31 To me “store of value” means either something philosophically able to store value; or some value medium that’s relatively stable (e.g. vs. gold). If a basket of stocks achieves that sustainably then it’s a store of value. And if not, then it cannot “store the value”.
2594 2018-04-07 05:28:29 You know you can move the funds out of stocks, lock in your gains, and invest in a short term cd to protect your principal, right?
2595 2018-04-07 05:26:59 Assault rifles are already illegal without a class 3 federal firearms license as per the National Firearms Act 1934 concerning full auto 'machine guns'.

2596 2018-04-07 05:23:59 It shoots military ammo. High capacity magazines are available. Bump stocks make it almost automatic. Why should this type of firepower be available to the public?

2598 2018-04-07 05:23:17 Yeah cuz Bitcoin shouldn't be like no damn stocks. You shouldn't be able to buy the shit then potentially lose money. Should just be a steady currency that doesn't fluctuate. Yeah people are making money off that if they were smart, but the way it's being handled just ain't right
2599 2018-04-07 05:20:22 People like you humping on fud-pumping will be the laughing stocks when it's said and done. What, you can't find your own things to discuss? Oh, nobody's listening, so why not waste time with talking smack? Time will tell the story. Either way, your words are wasted.

2633 2018-04-07 04:37:19 Common stocks are part of a business. Markets are there to serve you, not to instruct you. You can often find a couple of companies that are out of line. Find one; get rich. Most people think that what the stock does from day to day contains information, but it doesn't.
2634 2018-04-07 04:36:52 Wow I agree exactly. So equities go higher yes, but do you think they go up on a real basis? I would think gold, silver, commodities, real estate and natural resource stocks perform the best because they're small markets with best margin of safety.
2635 2018-04-07 04:36:52 you mean traitor trump who wiped his ass with the second amendment when he banned bump stocks, its called shall not be infringed

2644 2018-04-07 04:26:07 Trump said we will feel some pain but my stocks are tanking,  but I’m so glad Ivankas clothing line is exempt from this trade war.  
2645 2018-04-07 04:26:02 Exactly! He tries had to walk a fine line. I didn’t tune in today, but it sounded like he was talking about the stock market and he is upset about how the Prez is handling it and he had some die hard Maga’s who act just like you said. For the record I trust Tom’s view of Stocks.

Related: people making minimum wage should be able to cover decent rent with 25% of income. That will hit both housing and stocks.
2649 2018-04-07 04:22:34 For stocks, one should register with nsdl/cdsl & ensure u get the monthly reports with the holdings. Very important!
2650 2018-04-07 04:20:43 it almost makes you wonder if he says these crazy things that affect certain industries to cause the stocks to drop so that he or his family can swoop up these stocks at a lower costs and make millions when the stocks rebound...

2669 2018-04-07 04:03:57 @realDonaldTrump support you on China’s theft / trad policy lost money in stocks but still support you NATIONAL SECURITY CHINA RUSSIA WALL
2670 2018-04-07 04:03:51 look at stocks as businesses; have a proper attitude toward the market; and operate with a margin of safety.
2671 2018-04-07 04:03:41 Antiacid stocks wld be way down..
2672 2018-04-07 04:03:29 A few months ago it was north of 25K. He took credit for it. Now it has sunk, and a lot of my (and other people's) stocks have plummeted. This is a reaction from the trade war. He'd ignoring it, when he should be doing something about it.
2673 2018-04-07 04:01:18 Even if the #StockMarket tanks under #Trump he still has his strong Christian values to fall back on. #stocks
2674 2018-04-07 04:00:20 My coins are with exchange, not stocks exchange... Do I still need to do a thing
2675 2018-04-07 04:00:03 Hopes raised that they can bail out an iffy government whose claims outstretched their stocks of supporting evidence..?
2676 2018-04-07 04:00:01 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
2677 2018-04-07 03:59:30 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2678 2018-04-07 03:59:18 So I’m not intelligent because I think he can do good things for our country and has done good things???? Check the stocks and the economy now compared to the last 5-6 years and let me know how that goes.
2679 2018-04-07 03:59:17 sir, you are talking ab DB?
2680 2018-04-07 03:57:07 Big fan of you and Invest team for keeping it simple but effective, just wondering how often you plan to update "your opinion" section for each stocks? Any plan for separate section for "recently updated"? Thanks Emmet!
2681 2018-04-07 03:56:36 No.  Don't even own any oil stocks.  I want to try solar for the house, but numbers did not add up.  Every couple of years I check again.

Is your concern CO2 in the air or carbon particulates?
2682 2018-04-07 03:56:11 SOON As you massive fucking orphan stocks are just happened there we are big menacing dudes….?

2685 2018-04-07 03:50:31 Such contracts are anti-American as bump stocks. Let’s have laws against restrictions on free speech. Why is this even necessary in 2018?
2686 2018-04-07 03:49:44 It's okay~ just a little bit dizzy~
*pushing some works since this week would be the last as employee

2688 2018-04-07 03:49:07 Sheriff could use some of that good old fashioned flogging in the public square. Then a week in the stocks. He left a previous position under a cloud of similar weak leadership...can't find the article...
2689 2018-04-07 03:48:15 @graddhybpc  hi, can you post  the top ten or twenty  uranium stocks you are bullish on right now , will be great
2690 2018-04-07 03:47:26 Sir, Which stocks maximum benefits ? Can we buy bata at monday opening?
2691 2018-04-07 03:46:30 Stocks fall another 572 pts. So much winning.

2695 2018-04-07 03:41:27 Social media screwed up big time by data mining. We also are moving to gold backed dollar. In the meantime, stocks will take a hit but rebound later. Don’t be a fool.

2696 2018-04-07 03:40:29 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2697 2018-04-07 03:40:05 Investments based on fundamental analysis has
1.short term/seasonal cycle
and 
2.long term/cyclical cycle

Investment based on the growth cycle rather than trading cycle/view and must do in correction/panic to get quality stocks at discounts.
2698 2018-04-07 03:39:10 I also bought  #IoT stocks many times.
2699 2018-04-07 03:38:24 Trump's tweets toy with stocks, leaving investors less sure of the game he's playing via @markets
2700 2018-04-07 03:38:16 I'm not a bot, my stocks are not losing value...I'm not dumb enough to invest in the DOW individually. As far as the SS. I suppose you're talking about Social Security. That's not going to go up anytime soon thanks to Obama.
2701 2018-04-07 03:37:22 Stocks Tumble More Than 2% on Trump Trade Jabs: Markets Wrap via @markets
2702 2018-04-07 03:36:55 Hey @rogerkver your passion is evident, that even those that make $2 per day should be a part of this revolution (I 100% agree) - but could you see a future where lightning works and merge back into bitcoin? You are from an era before crypto became stocks. Is compromise possible?
2703 2018-04-07 03:35:56 sounds illegal to me, the stocks part.  He's also interfering in the Pentagon deal between Amazon and Oracle
2704 2018-04-07 03:33:51 a rich customer said , to make money buy stocks when everybody selling !
2705 2018-04-07 03:33:49 There’s a trade deficit for a reason, we buy non domestic goods. Businesses buy from other countries. You’ll see hyperinflation and watch stocks sell off while earnings drop & unemployment increases. It’s flu season & @larry_kudlow just needs to stick to his rhetoric from Tuesday
2706 2018-04-07 03:31:30 DOW rebounded a little, thanks to big traders looking for cheaper stocks, but it still erased gains after Larry Kudlow tried to ally fears of a Trade War.  Clearly expect further losses on Monday.  Hope not!
2707 2018-04-07 03:30:04 They will buy maximum stocks of Chinese companies and One day America will  start water wars to end human race their favourite habbit is playing with fire !
2708 2018-04-07 03:29:24 thankfully i built mine just before the btc buzz, not expecting memory prices to come down but other components should be cheaper in coming months when stocks refill.
2709 2018-04-07 03:29:21 Stocks are up 
2710 2018-04-07 03:28:21 So because I think you have been very civil and we are having a civil conversation would you be ok with a stronger background check and raising the age to 21. With no banning of AR15’s? But still band bump stocks.
2711 2018-04-07 03:28:18 TRUMP HAS MONEY IN STOCK MARKET-TRUMP TWEETS ABOUT TRADE WAR-STOCKS DROP- TRUMP&HIS FRIENDS BUY ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AT CHEAP PRICE-WHEN TRUMP&FRIENDS BUY ALL THEY WANT-TRUMP WILL THEN TWEET NO TRADE WAR-THEN STOCKS WILL SOAR -TRUMP&FRIENDS MAKE BILLIONS
2712 2018-04-07 03:27:59 Agriculture is going to be the next IT of the world.  It is at the same stage what IT was in 1991.  With food scarcity and exploding population , finite land resources increase in productivity is the only answer.  Those who invest in the right stocks are going to mint money here.
2713 2018-04-07 03:27:00 Look into his buying stocks when they hit bottom. Look at all his aliases for purchases. Amazon, Boeing, Toyota, Lockheed-Martin
2714 2018-04-07 03:25:54 And even if they had kept stocks of it, they wouldn’t want anyone to@know about it, and wouldn’t want to advertise it to the world for just one assassination.  They have much better, well proven, means of achieving THAT goal...
2715 2018-04-07 03:25:43 I’ve made $4.61 off penny stocks, smh don’t fw me broke boys
2716 2018-04-07 03:25:35 I ain't got shot to say!!!

Nope!! This is a nice guy here. I ain't getting involved. 
I'm also never showing money on here, well for now at least.
Just cause I get it in a day doesn't mean anything.

That shit payed my mortgage, went into stocks, and property.
I just dont get it
2717 2018-04-07 03:23:56 Your facts are BAD. Stocks up since trump elected!!   2xxx plus
2718 2018-04-07 03:22:12 Happy I don't have any money in YOUR care since you don't seem to see a buying opportunity when you see one.  My stocks are still way up since #Trump was elected. So, go pound sand, loser.
2719 2018-04-07 03:18:26 We are forcing Change. America STILL WORKS! Our System Works! We had to be threatened to rise up.. People have died for decades & decades. This is great! We mustn't get complacent. We need bump stocks ban, strong-linked background checks, training, no gun show/online sales, 21All
2720 2018-04-07 03:18:07 Yes .. and their technique was
By going backwards 
By burning food grains stocks while going back
Made sure Germans starving 
Then encircling them to surrender
2721 2018-04-07 03:17:37 Stocks ending with big losses though off their worst levels. Dow was -767 points, now -533.
2722 2018-04-07 03:17:10 He did say part of that, meanwhile my stocks and 401k looks like 
2723 2018-04-07 03:15:41 Mainly for bank stocks as bond yields likely to ease further
2724 2018-04-07 03:14:40 How about them stocks? 
2725 2018-04-07 03:14:18 Really? Your ignorant comment IMPLIES you are unhappy with ALL the SUCCESS Trump has had. This includes JOBS, the booming economy, record breaking stocks market, tax cuts shall I go ON & ON & ON. You want to talk ignorance, look in the mirror sweetheart.
2726 2018-04-07 03:12:01 They opposed banning bump stocks.
2727 2018-04-07 03:11:52 DT is intentionally hammering the market - driving stocks prices. 
When they are low enough, his shell companies will buy.  He’ll then cancel tariffs and stop hammering companies. Stocks will rise. He’ll make hundreds of millions.
@SEC_News @SACDispRes
2728 2018-04-07 03:11:50 I love how nonchalant Trump talks about this while I, as an average American, is losing my ass on my stocks!
2729 2018-04-07 03:11:40 No matter how good you are to people, it won’t make them good to you
2730 2018-04-07 03:10:48 If any of y’all are good with stocks, liquidity, assets and all that ish help ya girl out lol
2731 2018-04-07 03:10:45 Unless Trump has created a buy opportunity. It only costs real money if they needed to sell stocks or they had a fund they needed to draw from that was tied to the total market. Buy now and hold; market goes up; Voila!
2732 2018-04-07 03:10:19 DT is intentionally hammering the market - driving stocks prices. 
When they are low enough, his shell companies will buy.  He’ll then cancel tariffs and stop hammering companies. Stocks will rise. He’ll make hundreds of millions.
2733 2018-04-07 03:10:08 The China trade war weird to you? trump is shorting agriculture stocks I guarantee it. #chinatradewar

2735 2018-04-07 03:09:09 .@realdonaldtrump admin has no central message...we are not in a trade war that isn't a trade war yet but could turn in to a trade war after the trade war tariffs may or may not come in to trade war effect...no cabinet member tells the same story...meanwhile stocks plummeted...

2737 2018-04-07 03:07:10 Nobody said he was perfect Lauren but it’s nowhere near as bad as destroying sovereign countries causing the deaths of millions of people in the Middle East funding and arming Isis selling 1 fifth of USA uranium stocks to Russia! But to name just a few of their crimes
2738 2018-04-07 03:03:59 played around with this a bit more - great tool. The free portfolio tracker doesn't seem to pick up Canadian stocks. For instance, I can get the $SHOP listing on NYSE, but not the TSX listng. #GoogleFinance was able to combine listings from different countries/currencies
2739 2018-04-07 03:03:14 Where in my tweet does it indicate that I fear guns or gun ownership? I wrote "Owning guns is fine..." And I do fully support the 2nd Amendment. Go for it, dude--buy all the guns you want. But as for bump stocks? NOBODY, except the military, needs automatic weapons.
2740 2018-04-07 03:02:39 Pretty sure Trump knows what he's doing in China and Russia. This man knows these people and whatever happens to the stocks will level out in time.
2741 2018-04-07 02:57:53 $FANG....energy stock.......everyone pumping it the last couple weeks.......how does it look to you now?  :)    All stocks are bad unless they are going up!  And 3/4 will NOT go up during corrections!  I don't care what their earnings or sales are because eventually, if it gets
2742 2018-04-07 02:56:59 Volumes picking up in stocks I hold. Maybe because they are good stocks unlike 99% of the crap people hold on aim and ramp.
2743 2018-04-07 02:56:48 Ever seen the 2/4 alternative to bump stocks?
2744 2018-04-07 02:55:58 I think 50 yrs. in stocks +life.!
2745 2018-04-07 02:55:08 @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the #winning bro... my 401K is down like a motherFer.  That #tradewar is legit soon.  At least lemme know what shady stocks you're in...my friends and I want some #Russianmoney

2747 2018-04-07 02:52:27 1st question is what exactly are we looking at? Because penny stocks can have same results and you make next to nothing
2748 2018-04-07 02:51:27 I do own stocks,  I'm liberal,  and i don't mind wealth.   It's what one does with it that worries me.
2749 2018-04-07 02:50:09 One person who then stocks his entire administration and cabinet with people who are as corrupt and venal and deceitful as he is, and is assisted in his disgraceful progress against our constitution by his religious fanatic VP and his cohort in congress...
2750 2018-04-07 02:49:42 I talk to my friends about memes like I'm investing in stocks
2751 2018-04-07 02:48:34 Most Stocks, only Closed down Between 2-3%.  Not Huge Selling.  #MarketTimer
2752 2018-04-07 02:48:19 Stop the BS, the stocks tanking gas nothing to do with a 'vendetta'. People are getting smarter, they are realizing how vulnerable they are to Privacy violations by these cos.
Most of us already stopped using amazon long time ago because we saw what bozo is doing to businesses.
2753 2018-04-07 02:48:11 This is the kind of talk that creates division. Most #2a people I know are fine with keeping guns from the mentally ill and banning bump stocks. Some are even fine with banning ar15s and the like. No one wants to take your hunting rifle or shotgun - useful weapons.
2754 2018-04-07 02:47:53 Ako na lang ba yung hindi pa nakakanood nong video? Ngayon pa lang kasi magkakaroon ng stocks sa Pandayan. Ayokong ma spoil.  #KathNielForYES @bernardokath @imdanielpadilla @YESmag

2757 2018-04-07 02:43:43 @XiaomiIndia @manukumarjain please clarify situation about #RedmiNote5Pro stocks and supply issue. How much time it would take to match the demand ?
2758 2018-04-07 02:43:42 Yeah wrong he’s accomplished nothing can’t get wall can’t negotiate DACA is trashing our economy job levels for March lowest in yearss stocks are dropping imposing tariffs is starting a trade war no one will win . He signed a budget he didn’t like another failure..
2759 2018-04-07 02:43:30 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets… bump-stocks… there is no civilian use for any of them… NRA’s answer to Everything is “More Guns”… flood the country w/guns… now, they'll tell you that you need one too…
2760 2018-04-07 02:42:39 B-but Risu! You could invest that money into stocks and make a 5 cent profit, then put that towards your GoFundMe! After all, people with debilitating medical conditions aren't allowed to ENJOY things!
2761 2018-04-07 02:41:51 Great work @YahooFinance!  The new site and app are awesome. I am using you to track stocks now.  Use to use Google but they lost the grip for now! #Stocks #StockMarket
2762 2018-04-07 02:40:51 Amazon is making money on Taxpayers. Do your research instead of worrying about the stocks you own. No reason they should get discount. 18 Billion dollars federal money went to USPS. Volume discounts is a false claim. Amazon is a delivery service.
2763 2018-04-07 02:40:23 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2764 2018-04-07 02:40:03 Look at the history of the economy. Stocks up then down. Pay goes up.  price of goods go up.  You don't like the market. Sell off. My 401k is in a glorified savings. Make a little more. Lose non.
2765 2018-04-07 02:39:26 Saw ppl r leaking stocks suggestion when someone asked what stocks u bought this week in twitter.. Do chk out..
2766 2018-04-07 02:38:37 #RealTime @RealTimers @HBO 

Cash in some stocks Eh?
2767 2018-04-07 02:38:31 I don't put it past trumps flunkys, to buy up these flatlined, stocks, and make a profit later, since these tariffs may not be initiated for months, if at all, with his evil mind, he is manipulating the stock market on purpose.
2768 2018-04-07 02:38:28 Promoters Bought Lupin cannot say about other pharma stocks but Lupin offers value
2769 2018-04-07 02:38:26 By BBH speaks a lot man.....he can have his own clothing line and wow imagine it all the stocks are constantly out of stock lol
2770 2018-04-07 02:38:20 He is probably buying low now, then he will say something good and sell the stocks high. This will all be done without his name on anything but I'll bet it's being done.
2771 2018-04-07 02:36:18 If you love Jesus buy me a few Amazon stocks.
2772 2018-04-07 02:35:25 David, how do you usually find the clean kills? You look for oversold stocks? Stocks with high volume?Thanks in advance
2773 2018-04-07 02:34:58 @CIRonline People are saying Trump is conspiring with others to make billions by selling off stocks then Trump tweets to crash the market then buy low, sell when high then tweets and buy low- repeat

2774 2018-04-07 02:34:47 Freak out ... forget about GE , my stocks are ... plunging
2775 2018-04-07 02:34:36 Sir ji these al are bulk deals where we get block deals of stocks..could you name some sites or app for the block deals
2776 2018-04-07 02:33:12 Ironically for me, I’m not short and I’m long about 25 pot stocks and my portfolio was up today.  Just barely though.
2777 2018-04-07 02:32:37 The paper? I’m people and I only buy the physical. Are you saying banks and hedge funds will go long and dump stocks and bonds?
2778 2018-04-07 02:31:24 Is $SPOT the next $NFLX? $SPOT ended the day up 3.93 to 147.92 - in #extendedhours up another 0.38 to reach 148.30 #Stocks #Stockmarket #markets #investing #InvestmentBanking #investments #stockstowatch #Finance #WallStreet #thestreet #economy #economics
2779 2018-04-07 02:31:24 Investors who Consistently Buy Stocks Expecting Returns Better than "Fixed Deposit" or "Aim to Beat Inflation" in Long Run are:
- Happy
- Peaceful
- Humble & 
- Create Mind-Blowing Wealth. 

Such Thought Process is with a Rare Few.
2780 2018-04-07 02:31:21 You are so delusional. Everything the government touches is shitty and doesn’t work, wastes billions of dollars. How is the DMV for you? 
2781 2018-04-07 02:31:06 Well said. Why stocks must go back up and if they go down, they can't stay down for long.
2782 2018-04-07 02:30:27 At one point of time everyone wants to buy IT/ITES stocks even at PE of 100 or 150, but now it's available at 16 or 18 but they're untouchable
Is it mysterious behavior of market or human mind?
2783 2018-04-07 02:28:34 He's probably secretly buying up a bunch of cheap stocks.
2784 2018-04-07 02:28:20 No private company could do this because they're beholden to shithead investors who do nothing but cry about the stock price
2785 2018-04-07 02:28:06 What say big man @petenajarian do we load up our calls for $BAC got some cash to splurge, don’t know how much is left in the tariffs $XLF the financials week on the horizon #markets #stocks #stockstowatch #earnings
2786 2018-04-07 02:28:06 Creo que @ulisesvalencia ya mandó vaciar los stocks de todos los Oxxos del país.
2787 2018-04-07 02:27:33 Chinese using 24/7 computer trading to manipulate the system by selling only the Dow 30 stocks to cause a market crash and scaring investors while buying up small caps.
2788 2018-04-07 02:27:23 In relation to cryptos or stocks?
2789 2018-04-07 02:27:06 @1. Haha ok. I'm good with $1
2790 2018-04-07 02:26:58 Great point. Terrible potential for kleptocracy, sabotage, treason, and corruption. Ethics committee seems to have failed to have any effect. 

I mean wtf. If my wife gets a job at EY I may not be allowed to trade certain stocks which the firm audits. And yet... The Trumps are OK
2791 2018-04-07 02:26:38 $tnb Currently, there are four A-list celebrities on platform: Running Man from South Korea (Kim Jong Kook), US president (Donald Trump), boss of the crypto currency world (Laomao), “God of Stocks”(Warren Buffet).

Can anyone confirm this statement?
2792 2018-04-07 02:26:31 That's because you're invested in the Dow. 30 stocks making up a retired persona portfolio. Sounds like poor asset allocation to me, and that's only your own fault.
2793 2018-04-07 02:24:57 People who want responsible gun legislation ARE the majority. The majority want to raise the age for purchases, enforced waiting periods, back ground checks for even private purchases, ban of high capacity magazines, bump stocks, & assault weapons.
2794 2018-04-07 02:24:20 Wonder who trump has buying up all the stock at a discount? When trade war is over & stocks rise he's going clean up.  Talk about stock manipulation.
2795 2018-04-07 02:23:17 No wall, jobs down, stocks down, no muslim ban, no lock her up, MEXICO is not buy your wall, They are all getting ready to go to jail...Fox isn't telling you because they don't want you down at their station pissing in the street.
I hate crooks in bus. trump going bankrupt 6 time
2796 2018-04-07 02:23:09 April is historically a good month for the #StockMarket So far in the 1st week of April the #Dow #dowjones #DJIA has a return of -0.71% #SP500 has a return of -1.38% #NASDAQ return is -2.10% #Stocks #markets #Finance #investing #investments #economy
2797 2018-04-07 02:22:49 Really? I don't remember seeing that
2798 2018-04-07 02:21:13 The stock market right now is perfect for picking value stocks with a strong dividend low p/e and good cash flow stay away from growth for right now and think long term, investing is a marathon not a sprint #buythedip #ValueInvesting
2799 2018-04-07 02:18:19 stocks are reactionary. that's what happens.  who the hell wants to be predictable?
2800 2018-04-07 02:17:30 Stocks I really like in April, in no particular order: $ANDI $CELZ $FUSZ $AMPE $MAXD $RNVA 
2801 2018-04-07 02:16:36 Yeah, they also pay them lifetime benefits/pensions. it’s a shame that the government wastes so much of OUR money. This is why they are unsustainable. No private company could do this! 

Privatize the USPS, get rid of public unions!
2802 2018-04-07 02:16:24 What special with these stocks, fundamentally strong (like sales or EPS) or technicaly?
2803 2018-04-07 02:14:45 Thank God for stocks and bonds
2804 2018-04-07 02:14:12 USPS pays warehouse workers 30%+ more than Amazon. That's a SHAME

2807 2018-04-07 02:13:11 @TheSkipper Most get excited about stocks after they've gone considerably higher. And compared to the overall market, this showed strength.
2808 2018-04-07 02:11:38 Sell what? Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Real Estate, Art??? All are asset classes. Can you be more specific?
2809 2018-04-07 02:10:13 QE drove stocks higher, nothing else. Earnings are lower now than in 2014. The fact that the Fed is following its plan and increasingly reducing its balance sheet means Global QE turns negative later this year. Without QE, stocks fall, with QT, stocks crash. Mkts are fwd looking.
2810 2018-04-07 02:09:53 Ladies. If you put HALF the effort that you spend on negative energy and childish drama into SCHOOL and your CAREER DEVELOPMENT...  There’s a whole different perspective gathered from investing in important things. Delete twitter and download news/culture/art/stocks apps!!!

2812 2018-04-07 02:09:02 trump and repubs making a killing on stock market-trump says "trade war" stocks down: changed my mind-no trade war-stocks go up-insider trading!!!
2813 2018-04-07 02:07:28 Thanks guys. I had looked it up before but it was mostly about stocks and honestly confused the heck out of me haha. It's much more clear now.
2814 2018-04-07 02:06:02 Appears diversification working very well.  Lot of #bonds up today, as is #gold. Many #international #stocks didn’t fall nearly as much as #s&p500.  A diversified portfolio of global #equities, #fixedincome and #gold down much less than -2.2% s&p return. Stay diversified people!!
2815 2018-04-07 02:05:42 Tomela......el 70% de la mercancia viene de China a EU, lo que significa que casi el 80% del dinero va para alla...y dije 80 por las inversiones indirectas, como afores y stocks
2816 2018-04-07 02:05:31 Lots of panic selling,  but we are in the C wave of correction on the $SPY weekly chart imo, and we are going to consolidate and move up in the next 14 days. Find the stocks you have always wanted more of,  and buy some imo. .. lower risk,  higher reward...

2818 2018-04-07 02:04:58 What makes u think the serial liar will do anything. He’s manipulating the stock market. He most likely buys stocks after they tank and sells when the liar says things for them to increase.
2819 2018-04-07 02:02:25 @IngrahamAngle  Would be interesting to compare China's pronouncements, subsequent market dipa, and their purchase of U.S. stocks

2821 2018-04-07 02:00:53 somewhere there is a picture of me at faire several years back in stocks with a sign around my neck that says "heretic"
2822 2018-04-07 02:00:07 The March labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed weaker-than-expected payroll growth, an unchanged unemployment rate and slightly higher wage growth; however, it did not appear to be a driver of Friday’s market weakness. THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA drove stocks down
2823 2018-04-07 02:00:00 Not even with high cap mags and bump stocks. You’ll be getting close to the that figure.
2824 2018-04-07 01:59:04 You suck. Stocks dropped again on Friday after you told the U.S. Trade Representative to find an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods on which to place 25% tariffs, another step in a weeks-long dispute over trade. That’s called a trade war—you’re retaliating against China.
2825 2018-04-07 01:58:58 That's catchy! Now when the value of #BananaRepublic stocks soars, #Trump will take the credit.
2826 2018-04-07 01:57:57 When the Fed reduced their balance sheet by 29.5bln at the end of Jan, stocks dumped 2 days later on Feb 2. $56.5bln would be almost double that and it doesn't even have to be that big given how fragile stocks are right now.
2827 2018-04-07 01:57:07 Yep....my stocks are looking like shit. My 401K looks like shit. My variable account for supplemental retirement funds now also looks like shit... Why have I wasted my $$, as a millennial, planning for my retirement again? I should have known I'd be screwed over
2828 2018-04-07 01:56:12 Which guns exactly? An AR15 or semi automatic in general? I agree with banning bump stocks but you can create the same effect without a bump stock, I also wouldn't mind a mag restriction but you can reload fairly quick regardless so I don't see how those would help much
2829 2018-04-07 01:56:10 on very little volume too!
2830 2018-04-07 01:54:46 No announcements of dividend increases from the stocks I track (so no weekly blog post), but look for $FUL, $PG, and $SKT to announce next week!

2837 2018-04-07 01:49:56 #DearDonaldJTrump warn me before you announce tariffs so I can short some stocks
2838 2018-04-07 01:49:46 What are they "deflecting" from? Do you know another reason why the stocks tumbled so much? Coincidence?

2858 2018-04-07 01:35:59 My 'guess' is the Fed is playing catch up on $56.5bln in assets they need to cut from their balance sheet in Apr and the escalation in the trade dispute with China and the EU (getting less attention but exists) is being used as the excuse for stocks falling to cover #QT effects.

2872 2018-04-07 01:15:04 I don't think you realize that it only reached 20,000 under Obama and that was the last year he was in office.  Who owns stocks? I do, and I did not sell anything.

2880 2018-04-07 01:09:47 The point is we don’t want guns over here. Because from what I see it just escalates situations. Cops guns, criminals get uzi’s, cops get AR’s, criminals get AR bump stocks, police get body amour criminals get amour piercing rounds. Where does it stop? Until you all have tanks?
2881 2018-04-07 01:07:31 The Trump cultists largely avoided the rising stock market during the Obama years. Because Fox kept telling them how horrible things were. They bought into stocks bigly when their leader was elected. Hahahahaha. 
2882 2018-04-07 01:06:06 @realDonaldTrump do not ban bump stocks! Support and defend the constitution as its written. Don’t allow the ATF to write legislation nor should you entertain any news laws proposed by any of their recommendations. #pewpew #GunOwners #DearDonaldJTrump #freedom #DontTreadOnMe
2883 2018-04-07 01:05:43 I think Trump has people buying stocks like crazy for him. Then he'll make a deal with China and get billions when the market rebounds. That is a federal crime punishable by imprisonment. I hope I'm wrong, but somebody is probably going to get MUCH wealthier from this.
2884 2018-04-07 01:05:30 Trump is manipulating all stock markets for shareholders and buyers to buy low as stocks prices fall.
2885 2018-04-07 01:05:15 Go Mazer!
2886 2018-04-07 01:04:27 I bet whoever is running @POTUS' business is having a grand old time buying up stocks at bargain basement prices for when he reverses his trade war rhetoric and the market predictably shoots back up again and he makes a killing.

2897 2018-04-07 00:56:10 I don't use stop losses, stocks typically move down before they go up which kicks a lot of stop/loss traders out of their positions.

2899 2018-04-07 00:55:31 Trump purposely started this trade war knowing that the market & investors will react. This gives his family, friends, donors, & cronies the opportunity to buy stocks at low price. Conspiracy theory? Most likely not.

2919 2018-04-07 00:38:00 wish they could have seen it much earlier, all he does is trash companies so the stocks fall and his cronies buy it up behind the scenes and then whoops all is good and stocks rise.
2920 2018-04-07 00:37:44 No glitch. It's the liberal left doing all they can to silence folks that hurt their feelings. I just had my account locked by some whiny fem-boy who complained. I got the same spiel from Twitter.
2921 2018-04-07 00:36:39 Yes, we got a blog post on sin stocks. I'll have to dig up
2922 2018-04-07 00:36:17 if you think these tariffs are bad wait til trump scraps nafta see what happens to stocks then @cnbc @cnbcnow @business @wsj @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @cbsnews

2927 2018-04-07 00:33:49 The Dow is 30 stocks.   Look at more
2928 2018-04-07 00:33:43 Can you watch my periscope on this?  The challenge isn't with the issuer it's with trusted third parties needed to move those stocks around and run ledgers.  A blockchain can replace those ledgers.
2929 2018-04-07 00:33:39 When they devalued the yuan 3% in Aug 2015, US stocks dumped and didn't recover until April 2016, 8 months later. What if they devalued the yuan?
2930 2018-04-07 00:33:14 Yes. Gold up, stocks down. 
2931 2018-04-07 00:33:08 China controls their media. They don’t have an election to worry. Their stocks are not falling as much as here. Their people don’t have 401k. They’re ready for this. And they will win. POTUS now has to find a way to save face.
2932 2018-04-07 00:32:37 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2933 2018-04-07 00:32:33 No, you don’t extend the time Trump can use to hog the spotlight.   He will go on to another target and stocks will return. It’s only a bump; not the end of the road.
2934 2018-04-07 00:32:28 April super stocks part 1 still have three stocks ,we will send them within thr next 24 hours for our V.I.P members with  our new strategy of the entry and exit . Get ready and steady those stocks might make a real huge gain soon ...
2935 2018-04-07 00:31:46 That’s complete BS. The country had the longest economic upgrowth period under Obama! Including stocks. He brought unemployment down to,below 5% from a high of 10, and had started reducing the deficit. Trump inherited one of the strongest and stable economies in record.
2936 2018-04-07 00:30:48 you are bullish on gold vs. stocks but still bullish on stocks and feel stocks are still in an uptrend? You must be REALLY bullish on gold.
2937 2018-04-07 00:29:26 @realDonaldTrump I know you are shorting stocks that you're manipulating via your false statements. Just have to prove it...
2938 2018-04-07 00:29:24 Stocks going up 
2939 2018-04-07 00:28:13 Ya I don’t know about that news making everything green, but I’m really not sure what China Tariffs has to do with pot stocks either? Hopefully Trump just trying to put a scare into China and they reach a agreement if so major exchanges will go up along pot stocks
2940 2018-04-07 00:27:35 When US media runs half-hour cheerleading sessions for private companies, does the SEC monitor if their parent companies’ CFO are prop trading those companies’ stocks? 
2941 2018-04-07 00:26:46 Aye. Louis James has left and is setting up his own shop. EB Tucker takes over one part of the gig (will be recoing lots of bank stocks and about 1/3rd resource stocks) and Dave Forest @piercepoints the mining spec end.
2942 2018-04-07 00:26:06 Guys...theres no indication from the tape to know a stocks going to T12 unlike a volatilty halt. You have to understand the risk from all the negative media and size accordingly. If you risk 1-2% you live to trade another day. No reason to be in any heavier at these levels.
2943 2018-04-07 00:24:43 not a share of $AVDL has been sold - $AVDL was basically flat for the week.  I was referring to stocks down for no reason.  $AVDL is down YTD because of dumb CEO, not dumb investors.
2944 2018-04-07 00:24:21 Buying under bought stocks is usually a benefit. Hard to know what to do in this choppy market. Do sitting on sideline on Biotech is what i will do. But watching carefully as entry point looks alluring at this price.

2946 2018-04-07 00:21:36 I trade stocks too, and crypto, so I feel this guys trading level equals to a yamcha... dissapointing
2947 2018-04-07 00:20:28 Not going to get into the Why other than Powell and team have made it clear that the Fed is not going to step in to save stocks until much lower and markets testing where that low is. And yes, 2400-2500 is my ideal BUY zone.
2948 2018-04-07 00:19:45 You laugh but it grew 31% last year. A good return on a year is 10%. Rn the market is being dragged down by big tech companys like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc. The Dow is just made up of a lot of stocks. Don't believe you can do some research.
2949 2018-04-07 00:17:11 Also most mods are not dangerous, sure bump stocks are a pretty terrible idea. But most mods help with stability and accuracy. For avid hunters and sport shooting
2950 2018-04-07 00:16:42 We all knew the company was trash/scam/p&d so of course you don't hold stocks like $LFIN for long or o/n but only play quick scalps which might be $1 or $2 per trade. The one we did today was from mid $25's to low $26's. Yesterday we locked $4/share total on 4 trades from $15-$19

2956 2018-04-07 00:13:29 You see, the way the stock market works...is that it doesn't matter what your stocks were worth last January, if they've tumbled by today.  LOL.

If you feel you want open illegals you take them and support them, as far as I am concerned he is watching out for my safety. And schiff go crawl away.
2962 2018-04-07 00:07:19 Stock market drops are good for Donald and his rich friends who I am sure dumped the right stocks at the right time. The average Joe’s 401K on the other hand will never make up the loss. This whole “tariff pissing match” is but a way for Don / his rich friends to get richer
2963 2018-04-07 00:05:54 His friends are actually shorting the stocks.  They are making money off the drop in prices.
2964 2018-04-07 00:05:08 Put your hat away, they’re just offering options for people who don’t want funds with gunmakers in them. Funds do the same for tobacco and casino stocks.
2965 2018-04-07 00:04:47 Absolutely, and it’s a good time to buy stocks that were too frothy anyway.
2966 2018-04-07 00:03:46 Remember when stocks went up & down due to their actual performance? Yeah, me neither.
2967 2018-04-07 00:03:01 @shero $SPY $SGH In this bearish market, I'm not out to guess where bottom is on stocks. These often go down further than one may anticipate
2968 2018-04-07 00:02:11 $TRHC $MB 2 tech stocks above their 50 day moving average, experiencing solid fundamental growth, that were up today
2969 2018-04-07 00:02:01 Bump fire stocks are gunstocks that are specially designed to makebump firing easier, which allows semi-automatic firearms to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic firearms. They can achieve rates offire between 400 to 800 rounds per minute.
2970 2018-04-07 00:01:23 Why are you so worried about the government tracking your weapons - full background checks, age limits, banning bump stocks, banning semi automatics, agreeing to periodic testing and certification - all makes sense. Exercise your 2A rights with checks and balances
2971 2018-04-06 23:59:51 This is getting crazy. Do these people really think that it's right to ask people to give up guns that were bought and paid for when there was no law preventing it. Is the govt going to reimburse the owners for the cost? Same goes for bump stocks, who is reimbursing  people. #NRA

2977 2018-04-06 23:58:11 Thank you! And a heartfelt congratulations to your Eagles. I was rooting for them along with you. I want to own casino stocks in advance of Supreme Court sports betting ruling. Which ones do you recommend? You've always liked Wynn.
2978 2018-04-06 23:57:00 Gosh, I highly recommend you sell all your stocks the first chance you get and stay out of the market until 2025 when @realDonaldTrump is out of office and Ivanka takes over!
2979 2018-04-06 23:56:48 This is simply not true. Confidence is seen in things like stocks&short term growth but companies&the government measure true  growth over the course of years to get a true metric bc consumer confidence can and will change rapidly bc of things that have nothing to do with policy.

2983 2018-04-06 23:54:47 So if LARRY KUDLOW knew last week that TRUMP was going to send the stockmarket down with trade war talk, did he sell his own stocks or WARN his friends in the stockmarket he worked with for decades about what was going to happen? He can tell them when to buy to!!!!!!!
2984 2018-04-06 23:54:47 $%!^. My stocks/retirement is not looking good after Trump’s trade war. Wonder what his historic low approval rating is gonna look like when more Americans start looking at their 401ks.
2985 2018-04-06 23:54:38 That's what the TPP was for. Trump backed out of it because he wanted to pump & dump stocks to make his buddies rich. He never intended to DO HIS JOB.

3019 2018-04-06 23:46:53 @jarthursquiers Hey J. Art, you mentioned you had a decent 4% month in March.  Wondering what underlyings you traded?  And if you are also selling premium in the 90 day range?  I keep having setbacks with large outlier moves in stocks like Tesla, Netflix, and Chipotle.

3022 2018-04-06 23:46:01 I trade stocks. If you look at the numbers 4% is nothing. The point drop sounds worse than it is. Does it suck of course, but if our trade can be more fair then it's a win for everyone.

3030 2018-04-06 23:43:13 Dow:  -700 Pts

US stocks extended losses and the S&P 500 hit a session low in Friday afternoon trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank will likely need to keep raising interest rates to keep inflation under control.
3031 2018-04-06 23:43:07 Slow down George the tariffs have not gone into affect. What he is doing is wrecking 401Ks and filling his friends pockets by letting them unload their stocks before he says these crazy things.

3046 2018-04-06 23:34:02 Like manipulating stocks by what he tweets out. This conman is making billions off of us from every angle every day. Y’all just letting him do it. FOH
3047 2018-04-06 23:33:42 Global trade and relations. They're complex. They hang in the balance, as the saying goes. How so? Stocks plummet as countries amp up the trade war. #Tariffs also cause prices to spike. Nearly all of us are affected. Tension begets tension. Dialogue is the way to go.
3048 2018-04-06 23:32:58 An escalation  in  rhetoric over U.S.-China trade sent stocks back toward correction territory. Read Schwab’s perspective:
3049 2018-04-06 23:32:20 Job growth is down stocks are down tariffs are taxes just on the poor. And national guard being used unnecessarily iagainst a FakeNews threat is expensive. He also making more illegal money than being POTUS would ever pay
3050 2018-04-06 23:32:00 Begin to think about bonds, stocks and investing in your employer’s provided retirement plan are key to making smart investments.
3051 2018-04-06 23:32:00 Only group pushing for Constitutional Convention are Republicans. Assault rifles were banned previously. That did not eliminate 2nd Amendment, did it? Common sense regulations, not elimination; no assault rifles, no automatic weapons, no bump stocks, no weapons for felons, etc.

3053 2018-04-06 23:31:30 This is the worst April start for stocks since the Great Depression. #DearDonaldJTrump - Please stop tearing this country apart.
3054 2018-04-06 23:31:21 As Soros buys and sells stocks around the world. He and his family live like kings. Okay then.
3055 2018-04-06 23:30:09 @realDonaldTrump says he is an excellent business man. Stocks say otherwise. #TruthTeller
3056 2018-04-06 23:29:07 ., Bloomberg  News Trump Rattles Stocks With His Tweets
3057 2018-04-06 23:27:56 Worst April start for stocks since the Great Depression.  #Trump
3058 2018-04-06 23:25:52 Hi Mark, does a stock’s correlation to the general market affect your decision to trade a stock or position size? My spreadsheet is telling me I do a lot better with stocks that have low positive correlation to the general market.
3059 2018-04-06 23:25:31 And CB’s graffiti
3060 2018-04-06 23:25:18 Possibly. There are all sorts of arrangements. An IRA funded by those stocks will have less available to pay out. An annuity with fixed payments underway is basically immune. Other sorts of arrangements also exist.
3061 2018-04-06 23:24:40 How many more went short on stocks??
3062 2018-04-06 23:24:22 In to the stocks with ye !
3063 2018-04-06 23:23:38 What he's doing is actually Securities fraud 
I advise anybody losing money in stocks to consult an attorney
3064 2018-04-06 23:23:26 As long as home invasion statistics are higher than school shootings, people shpuld have the right to protect their home and family with a firearm if necessary. No assault weapons or bump stocks should ever be needed for a civilian to own, ever
3065 2018-04-06 23:22:28 Oh, c'mon.

Like this mini Louis XVI & wife Marie wouldn't short-sell stocks, esp Amazon.

Er, I mean Steve & Louise.

3068 2018-04-06 23:20:27 Only stocks. You might as well throw your money in the street if you trade crypto lol. Plus taxes kill you on crypto trades, so its not worth it. I buy and hold crypto.
3069 2018-04-06 23:20:14 Check expiry dates of soft drinks & beverages. Expired stocks promoted buy 1 take 1.
3070 2018-04-06 23:19:04 10% tariff, 4% down in stocks makes 14% down and that is your fault
3071 2018-04-06 23:18:12 Hahaha to late! But living is learning! Unfortunately some people (me) have to learn the hard way. Stocks to trade scanner over the weekend ready for next week! That said my acct is green atm! I will take it slow to minimize losses! I will succeed! It's a marathon not a race 
3072 2018-04-06 23:18:00 Robinhood has no fees. I already have it for stocks. I’m just waiting for it to be open to other states for #crypto.
3073 2018-04-06 23:17:46 U.S. stocks just had their worst April start since 1929.  On the first day of trading for April (and the official start of the second quarter), the 2.2 percent drop in the S&P 500 was the worst since the Great Depression. 
And this was caused by @realDonaldTrump - Trade war!
3074 2018-04-06 23:15:59 Lindsay, lives on Temple Canyon with too many hermit crabs.

Put all their savings into pickle stocks. Can't retire.
3075 2018-04-06 23:15:00 These trade tariffs are really helping me, joe-american-chick. My stocks are f'd.
3076 2018-04-06 23:14:06 she invested her hard earned cash into stocks and not virtual skins, who the real winner 
3077 2018-04-06 23:13:45 You know nothing about the market. Days before Trump announced his steel tariffs, Trumps buddy Carl Icahn Icahn, who lasted around eight months as Trump’s special adviser for regulatory affairs, sold 30 million of his steel stocks he hasnr sold for years. Coincidence? Not.
3078 2018-04-06 23:12:58 Golden rule of mine. Never go long bad stocks and never short good stocks. Only 'no position' if the other  trade seems favourable. Prevents halt risks both upside (like buyouts) and downsides like what happened to $lfin today
3079 2018-04-06 23:11:43 For the Pakis and paki frnds commenting on this thread, the Chinese have set up a stall to supply milk and rice in three big towns of ur, run before al of it runs out on u. The stocks have just arrived frm China and limited in amount.
3080 2018-04-06 23:09:42 @maddow I bet the Stock Market was a plan for both China pres. & Trump to become the richest men in the world! "Upset the market, little guys back out, They buy up the stocks at this lower price, then the stock market returns! Next he's gonna do a same deal with PUTTIN!
3081 2018-04-06 23:08:02 Here's the issue of the moment! US stocks post across-the-board losses to close bruising week - Washington Post
3082 2018-04-06 23:07:49 That's for sure
All MEDIA OUTLETs have become laughing stocks
When u have Democrats Saying
"So Sick of the same Trump BASHING  every single day"
And most of them have no clue of the Truth just sit there & listen to their fav network 
SHAME ON ALL THE NETWORKS
3083 2018-04-06 23:07:27 Friday’s worst stocks as trade conflict and a weak jobs report disappoint investors
3084 2018-04-06 23:07:04 China has to be reined in and play ball more fairly Let Trump make his deal!!! The short term loss in stocks will recover !!!

3091 2018-04-06 23:05:07 wait a little bit longer then buy some stocks right when the market crashes.
3092 2018-04-06 23:03:23 CNN "Stocks plummet; worst beginning to April since the Great Depression." Laying it on thick, aren't we?
3093 2018-04-06 23:03:21 Aluminum prices or aluminum stocks? There's a difference dummy.
3094 2018-04-06 23:02:26 You have to wonder about the method... Brother Comrade Prez @realDonaldTrump makes proclamations that tank the stock market (or specific stocks). Brother Comrade Junior adjusts family portfolio. Stock market rises, and the family makes bank. Maybe? #TheWordOfWOD #WODConjecture
3095 2018-04-06 23:01:55 Hope your track stocks an abundance of bud lights and bourbon for me
3096 2018-04-06 23:01:37 He’s a disgrace. For 7 years he vindictively went along with the GOP to vilify Hillary, to no avail. He has to know all the violations Trump is up to but stocks with the party. I say good riddance. Or make yourself useful for your last few months.

3100 2018-04-06 22:59:38 @realDonaldTrump Stocks down for the week, the month, the first quarter. Another major scandal in Slimy Scott Pruitt. Trump loses it in WV speech. Don the Con hosting new season of The Biggest Loser
3101 2018-04-06 22:57:47 #gold #stocks in the #XJO,  #XAO looking more like the anti-Trump/reinflation/whatever trade. Long $PRU $BLK $TAR and thinking maybe this is the long-term place to be. Guided by the charts = just the visual of the daily/weekly auction outcomes.
3102 2018-04-06 22:57:05 It just takes a phone call from Trumps. By or sell stocks before his Tweets.  Today the market fell 500+. Trumps buddies could make a killing based on prior knowledge.
3103 2018-04-06 22:55:03 were is the picture of Sammy in the stocks??
3104 2018-04-06 22:54:51 It's not the problem with the stocks. They are what they are. The problem is with the stock analysts.
3105 2018-04-06 22:54:40 His base already believes the market sold off because it was China’s fault.  But the majority of them don’t actually own any stocks anyway

3110 2018-04-06 22:50:42 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are plummeting in response to your trade policies. Job growth has slowed significantly. You’ve managed to begin to destroy Obama’s economic recovery  you five time bankrupcy LOSER Way to go Trumpies #TrumpIsAMoron

3118 2018-04-06 22:46:26 #MAGA voters think if they don’t hold stocks, the market doesn’t effect them. But millions have 401K’s that are tied to the markets. I wonder how many have checked their retirement accounts lately.
3119 2018-04-06 22:45:52 CNN: omg! we just found out stocks and indexes don't always move up!!! omg omg the sky is falling! LOL there's a reason people don't take your sentiments on market movement very seriously at all.

3125 2018-04-06 22:41:13 Delightful cottage hospital. Welcome fire blazing in entrance hallway, lilac & hollyhock in the gardens, scent of old-fashioned stocks drifting in through the open windows on a summers eve. How very fortunate I am to have experienced this type of healthcare environment
3126 2018-04-06 22:40:37 Will work for penny stocks
3127 2018-04-06 22:40:37 Illegally buying and selling stocks, and other assets, under the guise of sanctions again, I see...
3128 2018-04-06 22:40:35 @realDonaldTrump I’m wondering as I’ve heard nothing about bump stocks. I recall you telling MSD kids and our nation that you personally were going to ban them. Has your word led down an empty path yet again????? You write EOs for silly things. So just wondering about progress.
3129 2018-04-06 22:40:28 Tbh I don't think he even wanted to win....he thought he was going to lose. Either way it would of boosted his Trump name and make him more money. Right now he's tanking the US left and right. Stocks are down, tariffs, spewing against the media, companies etc. It's a circus.
3130 2018-04-06 22:38:54 I wonder how many of trump's friends sold off stocks before the crash?

3132 2018-04-06 22:37:33 @realDonaldTrump GOOD JOB MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IDIOT.  EFFING WITH ALLIES JUST CAUSED AMERICANS TO LOSE A SHIT LOAD OF MONEY IN STOCKS.
3133 2018-04-06 22:37:26 @ThesecondAmendment @BillOfRights doesn't protect a person's right to own assault weapons, bump stocks or magazines.

3136 2018-04-06 22:35:09 No. In the last quarter, Netflix set a record for adding new subscribers. There has been a market correction in all internet stocks in the last month, but a boycott is not involved at all. Read the following analysis ( it's one of many out there like it)...
3137 2018-04-06 22:34:18 I wonder how much money he will make when Cohen starts picking up stocks on the cheap as Trashes Amazon and threatens a trade war to crash yje stock market. Making himself rich of his presidency. Almost barfed typing that last part.
3138 2018-04-06 22:34:18 U.S. stocks dropped about 2 percent, with the Dow falling more than 570 points, as the President’s latest tariff threat on Chinese imports fueled increasing concern over a U.S. trade war with China. #SUACCS18

3140 2018-04-06 22:32:44 "Fears of a trade war sent stocks down sharply today". I feel like they just record this headline as a sound bite and play it several times a week.
3141 2018-04-06 22:32:28 My home . I think Mass has been very effective in gun regulations. They banned bump stocks on February 1st.  
3142 2018-04-06 22:32:15 All this for what? So we can fly our flags a little prouder? Some false nationalist bravado? We are taking about the economic future of MILLIONS of Americans. From 401k's to stocks to retail store prices.
3143 2018-04-06 22:32:10 If the flow of big money into politics ever is substantially restricted, stocks probably would crash. But that might be  a good thing if it  sharply reduced grotesque inequality.
3144 2018-04-06 22:31:38 US stocks ended steeply lower today, as the fret over a US-China trade fight continued #SUACCS18

3147 2018-04-06 22:30:50 Just take a look at TODAY! Trump announce $100 billion in tariffs, and the DOW fell 400 points. A friend of mine went from positive on stocks like tesla to negative. In other words, an average American losing money as a direct result of Trump.
3148 2018-04-06 22:30:44 sentiment  = #CRASH  time get ready people the whole world is about to end as u know it any real estate is going to zero your stocks are going to zero  your life is going to zero... u are a #zero and send a thank-u card to @realDonaldTrump  for destroying your life ! > now u jump
3149 2018-04-06 22:30:24 That's not how the market works.  A drop of 600 points is not better because the total is higher.

Please don't ever try to trade stocks.

3152 2018-04-06 22:29:22 My stocks have gone down more things year than the last five. Plus, the job report was dismal.
3153 2018-04-06 22:27:30 @jimcramer I’m a 59 year old newbie to market just got into it on 2/2018, I got a small group of stocks/ EFT’s. I watch you ALL the time. Thanks for all your help! After the mess today on the NYSE do I go crazy and buy or just sit back till it goes down even more? I’m SO LOST:(
3154 2018-04-06 22:27:20 Imagine if they could get their day in court!! It’s coming !!
3155 2018-04-06 22:27:13 Stocks plunge the same day that the feds seize backpage.  Coincidence?
3156 2018-04-06 22:27:07 You mean those tax cuts for wealthy corporations that just use it to buy back their own stocks? Or the ones for everyday people that will expire as soon as your cronies all get re-elected?
3157 2018-04-06 22:26:22 Trump is doing this on purpose...  at the end he buys low stocks, solves the trade problem and becomes richer...  you see.  He controls the whole US
3158 2018-04-06 22:24:04 Great ... China has done an excellent job of talking , stealing in mass American IP .. ALL Administrations failed the country while the lobbyists were paid WELL from the China ... Take off the gloves it’s over !! PS Don’t worry about your stocks and bottom line
3159 2018-04-06 22:24:01 he attacks amazon publicly he affects their stocks. look at the law I just showed you. And yes it was illegal by either trump or his lawyer to pay off stormy. If Cohen did it then it was not only too big of a campaign donation it was unlawful as a lawyer paying for his client
3160 2018-04-06 22:23:48 At this point in #Obama presidency, #stocks were up 37.5%, under #Trump, it's up just 20.5%. #MAGA anyone? Stop kidding yourselves; the emperor has no clothes. He's gonna kill the economy single handed with his #TradeWar. #ImpeachTrump #markets demand it.
3161 2018-04-06 22:23:07 Trump just trying to buy cheap stocks...then when he has, he will out of nowhere, change his mind abt China and Amazon...
3162 2018-04-06 22:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?
3163 2018-04-06 22:22:35 They have records of root stocks, transfers until roots are updated are perfectly provable, so whats your point? A stock on a blockchain still boils down to lose the private key lose the thing. How is this substantially different?
3164 2018-04-06 22:22:06 WANT TO KNOW WERE THE TECH STOCKS ARE GOING as NASDAQ PLUMMET'S, well to RAT HOLES as DEFRAUD HAPPENS BEFORE OUR VARY EYES!!!
3165 2018-04-06 22:21:59 I am so confused right now. okay so ur saying dow 100 year rally, and low rates being bullish (identical to my prior point about CB role), saying racists didnt long Obama stocks. What does this have to do with lower stock market participation and economic inequality
3166 2018-04-06 22:21:34 no end to your stupidity-whenever you are finished messing up stocks-threatening china-disrupting our lives-let us know
3167 2018-04-06 22:21:03 Eascalating trade tariffs stocks dive 550 points
3168 2018-04-06 22:19:40 Does @realDonaldTrump get his jollies making reckless tariff statements after the stock market closes so he can watch the consequences on TV the next day? Or did his buds dump stocks yesterday before he threw the tariff grenade? A pattern has developed. #DrainTheSwamp
3169 2018-04-06 22:18:19 He might have to work at these dinners, and he can't grab any "p" anymore. In his mind, there's no reason to attend. Let's be thankful, he has no manners, he's an embarrassment. He'll undoubtedly say something to shame all of us, and cause our stocks to drop.

3170 2018-04-06 22:18:15 Stocks Tumble More Than 2% on Trump Trade Jabs: Markets Wrap via @markets
3171 2018-04-06 22:18:11 I would say you need to talk to one of my in laws who has money in stocks and is a trump supporter. He’s not liking that trump won’t keep his mouth shut and thinks this is not good but could be because he’s invested in stocks?
3172 2018-04-06 22:17:54 KBP definitely looks good in the stocks category and to be fair, he's really long and is great at trail D, although he's an interesting one where a lot of draftniks think he's too much of a tweener. That and his shooting fell off and he loses a lot of value w/o being great there.
3173 2018-04-06 22:16:57 My stocks rising. Im going public. If i write its goin publish. Your fuckin wit the best. No discussion
3174 2018-04-06 22:16:52 Praying for a quick recovery. Taco Bell stocks are probably down in your absence
3175 2018-04-06 22:16:40 Did you call your broker and tell him to sell off all your stocks because of how the market performed today?
3176 2018-04-06 22:15:44 Novichok isn't a real thing. The OPCW confirmed the elimination of all stocks & production facilities of chemical weapons in Russia.
3177 2018-04-06 22:14:45 Is the question about perception or fact? And how do you define exposure? Do you mean exposure as in owning stocks or do you mean a layman's knowledge of the market. Because due to age demographics Trump supporters are on average wealthier than non-supporters.
3178 2018-04-06 22:13:18 This is getting personal now, Donald. Your asinine brain and sphincteric reactions have caused my 401(k) to lose 2% just today. Are you doing this so that your friends can short stocks before you open your mouth?
3179 2018-04-06 22:13:02 Hey @realDonaldTrump you stupid idiot. You suppisedly went to Wharton? Idk about you but DSB told me that international trade was important. Your trade wars are crashing all my stocks ya fuckin buffoon.
3180 2018-04-06 22:12:51 Honest question. So with the stock market tumbling due to the tariff stance, is it more important that stocks are up , as previously stated, or getting our due with trade fairness? Seems they are opposite. #arewewinning. #canwehaveitbothways
3181 2018-04-06 22:12:47 You say I dont know anything about stocks liek Buffet doesnt know about crypto, then you say you have been right the whole rally, and I am rude because I am trying to make substance in discussion?
3182 2018-04-06 22:12:40 Oh, he fully understands how the market works. He runs his mouth about a company and their stocks tank. He then purchases those stocks at a discount. He recants, the stocks go back up, and wouldn't you know who won the pony.... 
3183 2018-04-06 22:11:32 More non supporters own stocks, but supporters own more stocks
3184 2018-04-06 22:10:33 Yup...and I moved all my stocks accordingly OUT of my portfolio.  It was artificially inflated and I was loud about it.  Yup. sure was.
3185 2018-04-06 22:09:37 Sadly nothing new, Trump making Kondratiev winter cycle even worst on top of the #stockmarkets correction, yet empowering China and Yuan with such. It is going to effect domestic prices of goods plus tariffs hitting farmers hard. #economics #TradeWar #stocks #StockMarketCrash
3186 2018-04-06 22:09:28 Stocks dive as Trump proposes more China tariffs; Dow falls 572. Not his fault huh? Guess only when it goes up
3187 2018-04-06 22:09:20 On a fait des stocks en février, on est pas idiots hein 
3188 2018-04-06 22:09:10 Trump's tweets toy with stocks, leaving investors less sure of the game he's playing via @markets

投資のガイドブック『Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits』の著者。投資家は決して10％や20％の小さな利益にではなく、何年間もかけて10倍近くになるような株価の成長にこそ興味をもつべき。
3190 2018-04-06 22:08:35 #stocks Just proof the stock market is rigged. Whenever the 1% could lose money, they take and hide it until they are guaranteed profits again. That's why China will own our country some day. Because our 1% only wants money no loyalty to country.
3191 2018-04-06 22:08:32 Does anyone notice how the msm seems to enable China by constantly criticizing President Trump tariffs? While the stock market, at first, went down initially it went back up. After constantly deriding America’s position, China picked up on their term trade war and hurting stocks.
3192 2018-04-06 22:07:18 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow @CharlesHurt @GOP @Varneyco Lost “the trade war” already! BTW Wall Street started bullying companies to cut jobs in order 4Wall Street stocks 2do well in the 1990’s. Now they punish POTUS if he tries to fight China’s trade war against us by tanking!
3193 2018-04-06 22:07:00 Score one for me with #MSNBC: I sent it a message saying not amidst, AMID, and the dumb network fixed it on its ticker to read: Stocks down AMID jitters over Trump actions, Mueller probe. Dumb network.
3194 2018-04-06 22:06:28 My personal stocks dropped 16% since you started your economic policy, and I know my 401k took a similar hit.  The tax cut didn’t make up even close to the losses.  You are trading thousands for hundreds of my money. You are being very unfair to me.
3195 2018-04-06 22:05:21 Have you not set the precedent with your wife that you're totally incompetent when it comes to anything outside of stocks? I did that and now expectations are ground floor low

3198 2018-04-06 22:04:24 I think everyone has to face the facts #MW2remastered 
Is not real this was probably just a publicity stunt for @Activision to get there stocks up because they are loosing money to @EpicGames and @FortniteGame
3199 2018-04-06 22:03:59 Again I want to know what stocks Trump owns Better yet What stocks Trump just sold and bought.Right before his trade War "tariff tax" But I'm sure there's no way that GOP even care.
3200 2018-04-06 22:03:52 Trump supporters are older on average, so that would suggest they are more likely to own stocks
3201 2018-04-06 22:03:24 What effect is the stock market’s fear having on retirement accounts? #stocks #retirement
3202 2018-04-06 22:02:43 Is that accurate? From memory, the analysis of voters in MI/PA/WI  by @538politics showed they were doing quite well with incomes comparable to Dem voters in same area. To me that means they also have 401ks/stocks. The "poor, rural" Job Bob Diner guy is a myth.

3204 2018-04-06 22:00:01 A close on Friday above 3291 would make this the biggest 2 week gain seen in EuroStoxx Futures for at least 48 weeks (since 5 May 2017) #stocks
3205 2018-04-06 21:59:42 Experts are predicting stocks could fall nearly 40% over the coming 18 months - I predict a huge boom for the crypto market
3206 2018-04-06 21:59:38 None of my indicators hit the lower 2.5 SD BB today. Very close but not enough to make new buys. Doesn't mean stocks won't go up just means I'm waiting for BB confirmation.
3207 2018-04-06 21:59:09 I hope you’re right mate! That boy Neves can play a bit can’t he?
3208 2018-04-06 21:58:45 In a month GDPR goes into effect. Better sell your T-Mobile stocks now.
3209 2018-04-06 21:58:30 Periodically the issuer can "prune" the root set of "stocks" they maintain and update them to all current ones, dropping all now invalid "stocks" from their records, timestamping this as well.
3210 2018-04-06 21:58:26 Stocks are way down as well Dumbo

3215 2018-04-06 21:57:05 I love that passion from Nuno, this is a special special time to be a Wolves fan. I hope Cardiff get caught!
3216 2018-04-06 21:56:56 I scrolled up the thread and I only see you mentioning Obama being black which I don't really get the point.

I think its simple: hot BoJ/SNB money, QE, China, plenty of powder to pump stocks beyond fundamentals (case shiller p/e). Still overheated today IMO
3217 2018-04-06 21:56:54 What happens?
USD strong stocks decline and vice versa so that other countries don't get cheap.
America can produce for Americans and it can redistribute income among Americans.
EVEN IT falls little it will get back to stability.
Inflated is back to balance?

3220 2018-04-06 21:55:31 Alright Bruce, I know this has been an ongoing argument. But consider this design: Company issues "stocks". They are literally nothing but a public key signed by a Company key. All root stocks issued are timestamped into the Bitcoin blockchain with @opentimestamps.
3221 2018-04-06 21:55:28 Except you would be countered with we've put 60,000 in a football stadium before, we play in a soccer stadium, and aren't the laughing stocks of mls. You're right it wouldn't be fun to talk about it because it's embarrassing for you lad.
3222 2018-04-06 21:54:41 Good. Now enact it nationwide. And a ban on high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and throw in stricter background checks.
3223 2018-04-06 21:54:28 If there was ever a time to buy stocks DO IT NOW because when China and the POTUS come up with a great fair trade deal, the markets "DJIA" WILL HIT 30000 .time to buy . All these guys talking about collapsing market are stand on the side line waiting to jump in "GOOD LUCK "
3224 2018-04-06 21:54:00 The rich (and smart) are loading up.  The value is there.  The not so rich are too afraid to pour their money into something so speculative, especially when stocks are scary enough.  Major FUD.  Fortitude, focus, FAITH, and balls are what it’ll take to pull through now.

3229 2018-04-06 21:50:20 My stocks aren’t winning now, that’s for sure. I developed a habit checking at market close too see how much I’ve lost. It’s painful.
3230 2018-04-06 21:50:08 And I’m telling you your opinion and your wife’s white women experiences aren’t relevant to the needs of black children. I’m sure jail stocks are predominately bought by racist white men, you’re not special. 
3231 2018-04-06 21:49:29 Hey idiot, that's reality. Markets generally don't go up by Politicians, although some stocks can , but Trump certainly is responsible for the trade war selloff & if you understood how markets work; this wouldn't be in question.
3232 2018-04-06 21:49:14 There is nothing in the Constitution that defends your right to have bump stocks and incidentally, there is nothing there to say you can have cased ammunition. Both could be banned without affecting your rights whatsoever.

3235 2018-04-06 21:47:37 On days of extreme volatility like today, I just sell put options of my fav companies at ridiculous low OTM strikes and actually hope the stocks get there. If not, well I’ll just pocket the premium then. $AMZN $GOOG $EL $INTC $ACN $NOC
3236 2018-04-06 21:47:16 I have a related question that Unrelated may be able to answer. Why is it that sin stocks tend to outperform?

3238 2018-04-06 21:46:55 It's crazy to think that I could have sat in cash for 6 years after the top of the metals market in 2011 and just bought weed stocks last summer then sold Jan and probably be ahead of everybody including myself who grinded out trades that whole time. Is less more sometimes?
3239 2018-04-06 21:46:49 Smart money is on the white house virtually shorting the stock market. Would love to see a list of volume buyers @CNBC #stocks
3240 2018-04-06 21:45:58 Don't look at the Dow And the 30 stocks it represents.  Look at the trade, the industry affected.  There is a trade imbalance, It needs to be worked on.  His approach (Pres Trump)is boorish, let's hope Larry Kudlow and some other advisors can negotiate a better trade agreement.

3270 2018-04-06 21:33:24 During Trumps presidency its A great time to invest in stocks especially when they go down.
3271 2018-04-06 21:32:54 they aren't playing games. they're making their analytic calls. just like they give out 12 month targets for stocks. its not a game. they run computer models and make predictions
3272 2018-04-06 21:32:43 Well, it isn't really successfully being used for that either (as opposed to gambling/speculation), considering it has a level of volatility that puts penny stocks to shame

3277 2018-04-06 21:29:42 stocks crashing is bad for everything because everything is more and more correlated to the stock market every year. Also, most commodities are correlated to the stock market. Commodities are: energies (correlated), ag (correlated), base and industrial metals (correlated), 1/2

3284 2018-04-06 21:26:27 Hey thanks again Donnie - perhaps act like you have a clue. (Reuters) U.S. stocks dropped Friday, with the Dow falling more than 570 points, as U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff threat on Chinese imports fueled increasing concern over a U.S. trade war with China.
3285 2018-04-06 21:26:18 Gonna be a nice market for the shorts over the next couple years re: stocks. No bear fears yet....temporary drop happening now.

3287 2018-04-06 21:25:00 Rising tensions between China and the United States pummeled stocks again today, as investors began to take seriously the risk of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
3288 2018-04-06 21:24:54 Stocks crashing is bullish for #bitcoin IMO. During ancrash, money flows back to commodities. The history of the price of gold should tell you everything.

3296 2018-04-06 21:22:08 I have to contest this. Encouraging people to gobble up already low stocks of keystone foraging fish like herring, sardines and anchovies is very impacting to enviro. W/o these fish larger fish starve, so do cetacaens and other organisms on up food chain.
3297 2018-04-06 21:21:11 What did you expect coming from a little weasel like suckinberg,I sure hope More people will delete Facebook and for their stocks to keep falling..

3302 2018-04-06 21:17:34 Yet not just Dems but GOP globalists are already quaking even on daytime FOX.  They act like they are scared of China - as if all it has to do is threaten retaliatory tariffs, & these guys are predicting stocks to crash & the death of US farmers...
3303 2018-04-06 21:16:00 Stocks are collapsing. Cryptos are already collapsed but are low. Stocks are still high and preparing to fall hard. Hedge funds record high withdrawals. Where will all that money go? Where Soros told them.
3304 2018-04-06 21:16:00 I read that 2/3 of the benefit went to 824 households making over $1 million. It would affect anyone selling real estate or stocks in an Oklahoma based company. There may be some dollar limit on it. It would affect me but I’m happy to pay it for our children and their future.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 700 points as escalating tensions between the U.S. and China exacerbated investors’ fears of an all-out trade war between the world’s largest economies.
3316 2018-04-06 21:09:41 According to Bogle the only way for the investor to invest is to let the people who run the standard and Poors index pick your stocks for you . Great for the companies that make it into the index . They have to do absolutely nothing to make a profit . They just ride the tide .

Really awful company.

3342 2018-04-06 21:00:41 No...you still get it. Daddy’s exaggerations and online bully pulpit can drive stocks down. Like his perceived enemy, Amazon. He owes those stockholders money!

3349 2018-04-06 20:59:10 After close stock prices aren’t recovering which is worrying since there aren’t buyers for the stocks even after the drop!
3350 2018-04-06 20:59:06 The next day after Trump elect stocks rose and rose again till Feb of this year. So you are wrong. That's what's clear.
3351 2018-04-06 20:57:02 President Trump is fighting to advance America through so many ways they are too many to enumerate here. If you listen to the news daily you may be on a roller coaster. Tariffs, trade, stocks are criticized then applauded. All good things take time. Trust Trump and stay positive.

3356 2018-04-06 20:55:26 Right to life and penny stocks.

3358 2018-04-06 20:54:40 Have you watched the stocks lately? Or do u live under a rock?@BornABadass2 and you are certainly not a bad ass 
3359 2018-04-06 20:53:40 I wonder if greater access to trading stocks/portfolio management (via Betterment, Robinhood, etc) is a net positive. A major con is easier to buy and sell as panic sets in during corrections, which is the wrong move. 

It's never been easier to lose your money in the market

3380 2018-04-06 20:46:48 Conspiracy theory. Trump is using trade war talk to let friends make money shorting stocks...or maybe using shell corps to trade himself. “FUCK CHINA!” He screams. Dow drops and he makes $$$. Too simple? Too dumb? No, it’s very Trump.

3433 2018-04-06 20:28:56 I shorted stocks yesterday
3434 2018-04-06 20:28:48 You will not take a penalty hit if you cash in your stocks and go to cash. Just don't move it out of your retirement account if you can help it.

3443 2018-04-06 20:27:17 1. Trump announces tariffs, market plunges. 2. Trump family/friends buy cheaper stocks? 3. Trump soft-pedals on tariffs, market recovers. 4. Trump family/friends sell & take easy profits? 5. Repeat the process. 
No way are Trump & his crime family above shenanigans like that.
3444 2018-04-06 20:27:17 While trump is attacking companies causing stocks to fall. Threatening trade wars causing stocks to fall. His people are buying up stocks. Then he backs away, stocks go up and bam...he made millions of not billions. Stop believing this bullshit.

3448 2018-04-06 20:26:05 This is like polls, to believe or not to believe.  Stocks are scared by a corrupt few.  We bailed the banks out a few years ago, they are already back at the same games.  Financials are pushing a scenario, true or false they are like the "fake news".
3449 2018-04-06 20:25:56 Join the room and trade with 15+ top moderators then you will know what to do with IPO's..options...stocks etc...you wont be scalping for 8-10 cents anymore.or pumping for other peoples gain... mention a friend too...look forward to watching you do what everyone else is doing 
3450 2018-04-06 20:25:28 If only I didn't use up my cash on the last drop, so many great stocks to buy on sale!
3451 2018-04-06 20:25:20 I'm convinced that either he doesn't have the slightest clue what he's doing, or he's shorting a lot of stocks.
3452 2018-04-06 20:25:15 The delta between ROW equities and US is growing, with ROW outperforming. I think trade war is just an excuse - the root cause of volatility could be valuations; especially in large cap tech stocks.

President Donald Trump threatened more levies against China on Thursday, stating that he has asked the United States Trade Representative to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs against China.
3456 2018-04-06 20:23:54 Blame criminals for having guns after the NRA has spent decades fighting tooth and nail to ensure the streets were flooded with them to keep their profits and stocks high? Kinda backwards, don't ya think? Only time NRA has favored restrictions is when Black Panthers took up arms
3457 2018-04-06 20:23:48  just stick to your stocks big boy
3458 2018-04-06 20:22:47 I'd give the trendline a bit of leeway for interpretation because the selling is based on an emotional reaction to rhetoric, which can change at a moments notice in the land of Trump.  The economic underpinnings are strong and we've wrung quite a few weak hands out of stocks.
3459 2018-04-06 20:22:40 These people who complain about CNN reporting about stocks are fucking idiots. Stock information is available through multiple sources. It's not fake news you sheep.

3465 2018-04-06 20:22:11 U.S. stocks dropped more than 2 percent on Friday, with the Dow falling more than 500 points, as U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff threat on Chinese imports fueled increasing concern over a U.S. trade war with China.

3467 2018-04-06 20:21:57 Actually, the wealthiest 10% have the most to lose, as they own 84% of stocks.  Trump's trade war might be what it finally takes to shift their backing away from him.  But many will suffer in the mean time.

My concern is that this swing market may be being insider traded by Trump confidants with advance knowledge. Buying short-term calls on down days & puts on up days = huge profits.

3497 2018-04-06 20:13:23 Is it possible this could be inside trading? What if certain investors knew if tariffs would be applied to Chinese goods imported to the US before it was publicly announced. The best time to buy stocks is when they’re low. The question is who’s controlling the yo-yo?
3498 2018-04-06 20:12:57 Why don’t you defend your ridiculous views at the town hall tomorrow in Greensboro. If you think closing the gun show loophole, background checks, and banning dangerous bump stocks are to “liberal,” just #ShowUpBudd. I’m sure there will be a seat reserved for you.

3541 2018-04-06 20:05:51 I understand. Usually Bonds and Gold work negative vs stocks, so equity selloffs usually mean gold and/or bonds rallies. That’s the purpose of holding them. Say 60% equities 35% bonds and 5% gold.
3542 2018-04-06 20:05:44 Go for the money, I reckon. Quite right, and the flog them to replenish stocks while you heal from your burns.

3568 2018-04-06 19:59:45 At some point we need to consider the odds that Trump is gaming the market and letting him and cronies buy up stocks that sink on this news. Then he’ll “reconsider” and those stocks will rise.

3624 2018-04-06 19:48:30 The market is having one of the worst days in recent weeks. it’s still no man’s land to be.

3631 2018-04-06 19:46:38 My personal belief? Crashing the stock market.  Betting his buddies like Koch bros, et al, expect a butt-load of money they'll make selling high & buying low, or just sitting & snapping up low-price stocks. Then they'll control ALL of America while the rest of us panic at losses.

3634 2018-04-06 19:44:44 I keep seeing people post that stocks are on sale after these drops of 2 or 3 percent. 

Keep in mind that the DOW first broke 20,000 at the beginning of 2017. 

I’m not an expert but if we’re heading towards a recession there’s a ways to go before stocks are really on sale.

3668 2018-04-06 19:34:39 Why is it that every fucking time the stocks start to improve, Trump has to wave his amazingly tiny penis at the economy and do something breathtakingly stupid?

Can he just disappear for a week or two so the stocks can recover?
3669 2018-04-06 19:34:33 Yeah but stocks are falling. Can you please tweet something to embolden investors again. As you know the only people that are profiting from this stock market drop are institutional investors buying at the low prices. Are we helping middle class America or not?

3678 2018-04-06 19:32:02 Whether the accounting is phony or not, the reality is that Chinese stocks have had great price moves from time to time and those have been very playable and profitable over the years...
3679 2018-04-06 19:31:57 It's all very good for the wealthy...
When markets plunge they can buy up stocks for cheap then manipulate them again with speculation and make them rise so those cheap stocks are worth 3 or more times what they purchased them for.

3690 2018-04-06 19:29:51 So is this the deep state anti-PPT selling stocks down?
3691 2018-04-06 19:29:41 Will check stocks - pretty sure we do. If not more due in this week.

3695 2018-04-06 19:29:00 Meanwhile stocks are tanking.  So much winning!
3696 2018-04-06 19:28:54 U.S. job growth has hit a six-month low, according to just-released Labor Dept. data. Stocks are taking a triple-digit loss for the third day this week.

3698 2018-04-06 19:28:36 Well we are finally getting some #Trump volatility. After his first year in office basically being a straight up market. If you’re a short-term trader, a lot of opportunity in this craziness. Keep a clear head and good luck. #stocks
3699 2018-04-06 19:28:18 Your watchlist should only have stocks within 20-30% of #52week high list. The closer the better. Discard everything else. #BroTip

3702 2018-04-06 19:27:37 Indeed, but the stimulus (at least to stocks) dissipated quickly ...
3703 2018-04-06 19:27:28 Don't trip on falling stocks.
3704 2018-04-06 19:27:08 it’s an app called Acorn I don’t know if you’ve heard of it but it builds stocks and helps with savings
3705 2018-04-06 19:27:03 Another note: when interest rates go up stocks go down. When u give a big tax cut, u contrbute to rising interest rates that usually slows down the economy. When the dollar is down, that also contrbutes to a slow down. Through in a trade war with China and Trump looks bad.!!!
3706 2018-04-06 19:27:00 On days like today, you just shouldn't look at the stocks you own.

3713 2018-04-06 19:25:51 @realDonaldTrump while markets & fake news panic during your negotiations w China, you should have Menuchin buy these stocks low and make money for the wall when they go back up.

3725 2018-04-06 19:21:20 USA: it is a patriotic obligation today : BUY AMERICAN STOCKS. If you sell today, your doing a favour to the chinese, who just want to sink your economy with unfair threads (like the petroYuan, like the...we will sell treasuries, etc.), unfair trade practices and ip theft
3726 2018-04-06 19:21:15 Possibility of closing stocks in green today is 99% @jimcramer
3727 2018-04-06 19:21:02 stocks are looking great today, how 'bout it @realDonaldTrump
3728 2018-04-06 19:20:49 If I'm not mistaken, bank stocks are WAY higher than they were 11 months ago. No?
3729 2018-04-06 19:20:39 Friday night wisdom - watch the US Masters and not the charts. Nothing of interest in currencies or stocks at the moment

3731 2018-04-06 19:20:21 Could really use a nice rebound on my stocks in the last 40 minutes of the market today to make me feel a little better this week
3732 2018-04-06 19:20:07 How come @realDonaldTrump is not taking credit for the stocks market dropping?  This is directly tied to you.  Own it.
3733 2018-04-06 19:19:59 Like all his other strategies, analysis, choose long term value, Buy & Hodl forever. loves income producing/dividend paying stocks, so he will buy revenue producers. Would not be surprised to see him partner with mining group or possibly buy an exchange.
3734 2018-04-06 19:19:56 Headlines: "U.S. job growth has hit a six-month low, according to just-released Labor Dept. data. Stocks are taking a triple-digit loss for the third day this week."

Boy, I've just about had enough of all this winning. #MAGA
3735 2018-04-06 19:19:44 Those stocks represent the value of American companies. Which means everyone working at a publicly traded company is involved in the stock market.
3736 2018-04-06 19:19:11 JUST STOCKS !
3737 2018-04-06 19:19:09 I understand Y the market drops when the asshole traitor opens his mouth w/some new hair-brained kudlow scheme 2 help his wealthy friends make money but Y do Utility stocks drop? Trade wars affect products not totally used in the States. But the bottom line is he's still a moron.
3738 2018-04-06 19:18:48 So China threatens to cut off rare earth metal exports to America. Hmm, maybe it's time to buy stocks in American companies that explore and produce rare earth materials here in America. #China #TradeWar

3741 2018-04-06 19:18:12 Problem is most of his supporters not only don’t have any stocks, they don’t understand how the stock market works. So they don’t care about the instability. Until their actual jobs are taken, the economy is doing great b/c they got an extra $5 in their paycheck due to tax cuts
3742 2018-04-06 19:18:00 What's the venn diagram of people who used to tweet about pricey stocks and now tweet about falling prices?
3743 2018-04-06 19:17:58 I hope Donny shorted his stocks and is making money on the falling stock market.
3744 2018-04-06 19:17:56 You should find out how Obama regulated business to tank their stocks, then had his friends buy in low, then removed the regulations to raise prices. Made friends very rich. Or skip the read and wait for the court dates. No more hiding.

3753 2018-04-06 19:16:47 Know what would be a nice birthday gift.  Some stocks. Not sock. STOCKS.
3754 2018-04-06 19:16:45 Trump hates average Americans who depend on the stocks in their retirement plans to get by as they age.  His inexplicably bellicose actions against China, starting a trade war, and tanking our stock market, took billions from the worth of our retirement accounts.  WHY??
3755 2018-04-06 19:16:41 You took full credit for the stock market going up so I'm giving you full credit for the tumble my stocks are currently taking.  Idiot.
3756 2018-04-06 19:16:29 Looks like the corporations are buying back their stocks as its starting to recover a little.
3757 2018-04-06 19:16:12 Since March 25 Mercury that controls communication is in retrograde motion. It is this effect that communications between US and China will not be sorted out.Mercury goes direct on April 15 and by 4/12 one should see the trade war will have been over and the stocks are soaring.
3758 2018-04-06 19:16:09 The #FreeTrade Lie is that TRADE somehow INCREASES Economic Growth in BOTH Economies ... that is intellectually impossible (which means that #Globalist are PURE Liars = They get rich while our #MiddleClass is decimated = average wages SAME "value" now as 1980 but stocks up 2500%
3759 2018-04-06 19:16:04 Trump: #Tariffs may hurt a little but the stocks are up "40 or 42%".  What numbers is he using?  If we use his inauguration, it is up 19%. If we use the first year he replaced the Fed chief, passed his tax cuts and approved a first budget (post Obama), it is down 10%.  #winning
3760 2018-04-06 19:16:01 2.50 is a little dicey. Look at stocks like CCME that were a total scam. Still opened single digits.
3761 2018-04-06 19:15:45 Stocks continue their dive as trade tensions escalate.  @realDonaldTrump we must be so tired of “winning.”

3764 2018-04-06 19:13:56 As expected, Stocks open lower. Dow -175 points though off worst levels.
3765 2018-04-06 19:13:42 BUT MEANWHILE STOCKS ARE TANKING CAUSE OF YOUR STUPID TARIFFS
3766 2018-04-06 19:13:38 He attitude and positioning is clear - he is learning from his boss. Both are out of touch. And I do own bank stocks, and there is no need to thank him. That much I know.
3767 2018-04-06 19:13:30 Yeah, exactly we know they have a schedule now loaded with Japanese stocks and maybe that's why they said the mv it's not about comeback in order for us to not get too excited about it. because they can't handle the comeback now because they have something else to do.

3772 2018-04-06 19:13:12 I'm wondering if this market scare was set on purpose... the lower the market goes, the cheaper stocks are to buy. Remember, trade tariffs are only rumored, and not set yet.... hmm.
3773 2018-04-06 19:12:55 Yes thank you!! I been loving sitting in USD  and a bit of gold the last month or so. Got to actually enjoy my Mexico vaca. Sold all my stocks at max profit. I suck at short selling so I'll just sit back and be patient for opportunity. Keep up the great work @Hedgeye
3774 2018-04-06 19:12:52 Yeah, we are also seeing stocks crash and inflation barreling at us at 1,000mph. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer in Trumperica #TradeWars #economy

3800 2018-04-06 19:08:56 Either trump is that bad at negotiating or he's manipulating the markets on purpose so his friends can get in on the stocks diving, and then he can pull back so it goes back up.

3819 2018-04-06 19:06:12 Simple, while the unbelievers run for thr hills, BUY,BUY, good solid stocks! COME BACK WILL BE BIG!!!!

3820 2018-04-06 19:06:08 Dow sinks 700 points as trade war fears pummel stocks.
3821 2018-04-06 19:06:04 When $USDJPY rises, stocks go up due to carry trade.  The opposite is also often true.  If $USDJPY stable while stocks go down it could mean that when dollar falls, stock drop may accelerate (IMO, my interpretation only)
3822 2018-04-06 19:06:03 You should be most afraid when stocks ignore Trump, because the longer they pretend there is not a problem the harder the snap back will be.

3827 2018-04-06 19:04:34 Don't worry about the stock market falling again, Russian oligarchs will buy the lower priced U.S. stocks and it will rebound again.
3828 2018-04-06 19:04:28 @realDonaldTrump U.S. job growth has hit a six-month low, according to just-released  Labor Dept. data. Stocks are taking a triple-digit loss for the third  day this week.   Nice job, jerk.

3836 2018-04-06 19:02:13 US stocks down by 3% today. @realDonaldTrump is doing a great job if the purpose is to increase US unemployment and lower incomes of US workers.
3837 2018-04-06 19:01:58 Funny how u were not tweeting when stocks soared the 26 months post election.
3838 2018-04-06 19:01:39 Mr president please put this criminal Adam Fuestein behind the bar by trashing BIO Tech stocks with his trash articles against BIO Tech stocks.
3839 2018-04-06 19:01:29 Is that why he's pushing to ban bump stocks? Protecting our constitutional rights? Muh 4D chess though
3840 2018-04-06 19:01:20 Only briefly and only if stocks continue to selloff, reminiscent of 2008. When the stock market sold off then, I dragged the metals with it before they rallied to their peak in 2011. If that does happen, I expect it more in gold than silver.
3841 2018-04-06 19:01:04 $GILD $EDIT $CRSP $VRTX Time to load your truck with these biotech stocks.
3842 2018-04-06 19:01:02 What happens when people get nervous and cautious? The defer big purchases, sell stocks, hold some cash. Does that work in a consumer driven economy? Nope. Basic math should be a requirement for entering the White House. Even for just a frigging tour let alone as chief!
3843 2018-04-06 19:01:02 Stock drop: $NLNK and 497 other stocks drop #StockDrop #NLNK
3844 2018-04-06 19:01:01 STOCKS & BONDS:  If you are cutting back on your stock holdings in your 401K, you may want to leave your money in money market "cash".  BONDS too are risky.  China holds $1.3 TRILLION of USA debt, and can dump bonds & tank the USA economy if Trump angers them.

3856 2018-04-06 18:58:27 I am holding 0 stocks; all puts.  Closing most into the weekend.  Cash is cozy.
3857 2018-04-06 18:58:22 Going to be the single record loss for Wall Street in a day. Stocks are on a straight free fall and there’s still an hour left. Good thing I’m on the sidelines.
3858 2018-04-06 18:58:16 Seriously, do you thinks all stocks gain everyday?  Stop watching it, revisit it in 2-3 weeks.
3859 2018-04-06 18:58:00 How come steady growth that we have seen for the last 8 years wasn't good enough? I was really happy to see my stocks steadily rise and not have to worry what some ahole in the WH would say to fuck with it.

3867 2018-04-06 18:56:38 What the chances the Trump family will be buying stocks as the price falls?
3868 2018-04-06 18:56:19 Me on days when the markets are doing well: Man I wish I owned stocks.

Me on days when the markets are doing badly: Haha suckers!!
3869 2018-04-06 18:56:19 Stocks are all on sale today! Time to buy!
3870 2018-04-06 18:56:10 Dow now down over 700 points. #Stocks
3871 2018-04-06 18:56:07 I don’t know much bout markets, but it looks like Trumps using the bully pulpit to force the 1% to heal. That’s about 4 times now he’s directly impacted stocks. No one I know has money in stocks so power to him.
3872 2018-04-06 18:55:51 I really hope @foxandfriends runs many stories over the weekend on how Trade Wars & corporate fights are bad for the economy & GOP political support! That could really help my stocks recover on Monday! $SGMO $TRIL $LPTX $CNCE $DVAX

3875 2018-04-06 18:54:37 Stocks getting slaughtered. Thanks Trump
3876 2018-04-06 18:54:20 I wouldn't buy anything in the near future... Too many issues against the stocks, and the economy
3877 2018-04-06 18:54:18 What a great week for stocks.
3878 2018-04-06 18:54:00 I think all stocks are just falling in love right now
3879 2018-04-06 18:53:41 I really think this year is Value stocks with good fundamentals against the common growth stocks. See you at the top.
3880 2018-04-06 18:53:37 Wall Street getting its regular Friday pounding as US stocks hit again on trade war jitters, employments numbers.
3881 2018-04-06 18:53:34 Where do you find percentage of stocks over vwap? I feel like that would be an extremely helpful intraday indicator.
3882 2018-04-06 18:53:29 Please tell me Mr. Prezidente, Sir.....why are stocks going down? That doesn't look like winning to me.

3886 2018-04-06 18:52:39 @facebook Piss on Facebook no confidence in them with no security on there product they are worthless, I canceled them today along with messenger. Hope your stocks fall to O. Can’t trust you.
3887 2018-04-06 18:52:39 Stocks have now lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than in any year since the Great Depression. Maga
3888 2018-04-06 18:52:20 Stocks have lost more in 2nd qtr 2018 than in any year since the Great Depression. This is your dog and pony show. You’re a numbskull
3889 2018-04-06 18:52:06 The stocks have been dropping since facebook so i mean either gamble for it to drop lower or buy now lol thats how i see it....i dont even see the drop as a threat since the lower it gets the more you earn when it rises
3890 2018-04-06 18:51:44 Some stocks are just getting slaughtered that usually don't get slaughtered: $JNJ, $DIS, $NOC--heavy program selling right now... intense machine sells

3894 2018-04-06 18:50:20 In The Market: Many IBD fans follow, just as @IBDinvestors does, numerous psychological indicators. They can help spot a market bottom, but they alone cannot mark the bottom. Example: the #put - #call volume ratio hit 1.26 on March 23, but #stocks are losing recent gains again
3895 2018-04-06 18:50:15 Um, the Left expels (gets fired, etc) heretics, the Right debates them. Seems you’re the 19 century guy. Also Left puts them in public stocks, much like the 19th
3896 2018-04-06 18:50:06 @zerohedge   200DMA broken, Trump/White House telling public stocks will take a hit likely, Mnuchin nopt ruling out a trade war, Powell staying on tightening course w/ no comment on mkt volatility!!  Monday crash!
3897 2018-04-06 18:50:02 He's doing an excellent job which was LONG over do. 
Watching stock market daily as a judgment tool then post with dumps should be WHOM owned the stocks trying to manipulate for own agenda.
Adjusting is tough but must happen to benefit USA&BIZ long term
3898 2018-04-06 18:49:48 The next breakdown that takes out the February lows could trigger a dramatic selloff. If that occurs, it would confirm a bear market, and there would be no reason to be heavy in stocks.

3904 2018-04-06 18:48:27 @realDonaldTrump look the stocks are DOWN. Where's your Tweet about that oh that's right you only tweet when the markets are up haven't been doing too well this week have they. #MAGAIMPEACHTRUMP
3905 2018-04-06 18:48:12 Really?!?! “Stocks dive as US proposes more China tariffs; Dow falls 620”
3906 2018-04-06 18:48:09 @Sarge986 What do you make of the point that it is because the removing of accommodation at the Fed that is causing stocks to fall.?
3907 2018-04-06 18:48:02 Dear President Salamander.  Stocks disappearing. Time to again walk backwards and, if possible, put aside your pride
3908 2018-04-06 18:47:50 Res Ffb Grp Nrp was flying today!Imagine they get cleared how this stocks will fly.
3909 2018-04-06 18:47:35 Yet the definition of speculator is “a person who invests in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of making a profit.”
3910 2018-04-06 18:47:19 ... sooner or later you will be right! money will be created, again and again and again... it will not stop here, crazy... stocks will go higher, not because everything is great... because money gets DEVALUED!!! every single day
3911 2018-04-06 18:47:18 I'm also loving the BUYS right now on tech stocks.  Likely will never be this low again.   Way to go, @POTUS!

Setting up for early retirement.
3912 2018-04-06 18:47:14 "U.S. stocks extended losses and the S&P 500 hit a session low in Friday afternoon trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will likely need to keep raising interest rates to keep inflation under control."
3913 2018-04-06 18:47:01 Stocks really sliding in past half hour - have to imagine that traders are concerned about what could happen over the weekend.
3914 2018-04-06 18:46:32 Stocks tumble as DOW drops 700pts amid China trade war concerns.
3915 2018-04-06 18:46:13 @jimcramer  Do you think Monday might be even worse than today once retail reads the papers this weekend?  White House/Trump saying stocks may take a hit. Mnuchin doesn't rule out Trade War.  This is crazy.
3916 2018-04-06 18:46:01 Hope it will cross $50 again end of the day
3917 2018-04-06 18:45:50 As far as I'm concerned all selling off stocks are unpatriotic chickens. China must be held to a level playing field.
3918 2018-04-06 18:45:34 And congress(controlled by the lame GOP) allows it. We’re heading into very scary territory with military at our southern border, TRump manipulating stocks, the cabinet acting entitled, the rich getting tremendous and forever tax breaks, and the continuing hate speak of 45
3919 2018-04-06 18:45:33 @jimcramer What about us new investors entering market in Feb. I don't have cushion of 2017 gains. Retired, entered with 15,000 all top stocks at feb prices. Now what do I do. Down 2100.00 Google, HD, Adobe, Cat, Alb, Apple, Baba, Tsla
3920 2018-04-06 18:45:19 You are amazing sir. I cannot comprehend how you made America Great again I don’t see that. You created a trade way and stocks are going down You are making enemies with our allies America will have surplus pork and they will be approaching WH Stormy will get you sir take asylum
3921 2018-04-06 18:45:17 I guess this is now the @larry_kudlow sell-off? Mnuchin and he - supposedly the ballasts in the storm with Cohn, McMaster and Tillerson gone - now seem to be almost capitulating on this China #tariffs / trade war stuff ... throwing their hands up. #stocks
3922 2018-04-06 18:45:05 Agree.  Automotive stocks down 20% on year, “tumbled” 3% on news, up 5% since news.  Doesn’t mean Ford and GM want tariffs or that anyone “lied” to me about tariffs or that Trump’s brainless fumbling was wise or that his trade war lowers producer prices. It raises them.
3923 2018-04-06 18:44:56 WAAH, WAAH, WAAH, Poor Donny and little Ivanka, two unqualified entitled nobodies who cannot understand your poor decision making. Now stocks are plummeting which will put 401Ks in the toilet, forcing retirees back to work... Yep folks the Trump family screwing up in WH.
3924 2018-04-06 18:44:34 I expect downward pressure on US stocks through next tues or wed.
3925 2018-04-06 18:44:31 اقساط التأمين المكتتبة GWP  NWP لعام ٢٠١٧ تقريبا ضعف ٢٠١٦ مما يعني ان هناك تحسن في عمليات الشركة التسويقية إضافة إلى ارتفاع الحصة السوقية للشركة في التأمين الطبي. 
اما بالنسبة لتوزيع أرباح او ابقائها تبقى مجرد احتمالات وهو أمر جيد نسبي. و افضل من عدم توزيع أرباح بتاتا.
3926 2018-04-06 18:43:49 Let me see....the USPS is losing millions of dollars because of Amazon, the Obama administration legalized bump stocks, voter fraud in California "millions and millions" (completely made up number and not a fact anyway), "we've started building the wall" on 4/4, out of space...

3945 2018-04-06 18:38:45 Overreacting sells again. Everything with tariffs is good for us economy. Trade deficit with China is insane so someone has to do something insanely. @realDonaldTrump @TheStreet stocks rally begins soon

3949 2018-04-06 18:38:10 This is true. Although 95% of the people that I know that invest in stocks don’t short-sell. They put their money in, and let the market do what it needs to do.

4089 2018-04-06 18:02:25 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, you do realize that this isn't a reality TV show where whatever you do the network ratings go up. Because in reality, what you've been doing is causing solid American stocks to go down.

4116 2018-04-06 17:54:31 I don't see any point investing in stocks for 12-15% returns... That may be good for HNI but not for small investor. That's why I guess small caps are best for small investor!
4117 2018-04-06 17:53:34 Sadly, many (mostly retail) try to board the aeroplane (next multibagger stocks) looking at fast moving train (market) & then when there is little turbulence (volatility / corrections) directly jump in to Bullock Cart (FD)
4118 2018-04-06 17:53:20 Personally I'm all for bringing back the public stocks for rape & abuse. Out in the open, exposed to the elements and all the town's women. Possibly a small stall providing rotten veg for target practice. I'm not kidding.
4119 2018-04-06 17:53:11 Which is why raising the minimum wage would have done far more for the economy than a tax cut. Especially one that benefits primarily those who already have so much they just squirreled it away in banks and stocks.

4206 2018-04-06 17:12:18 Are we negotiating with China?  NO. Trump sends out his lapdogs like Kudlow and Mnuchin to spout double talk.  The market is only going down and down as more and more investors get more and more worried.  Who would buy stocks now?

4236 2018-04-06 16:52:50 do you leverage while trading stocks?

I'm asking because I'm risking around 1% per trade, I trade in cash without leverage and even in a good month I make around 5-15%.

4291 2018-04-06 16:29:08 Headlines on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks tumble again on trade worries, weak jobs report. So much for your give back to the billionaires on a tax break. Those of us that are educated know that was a dumb idea.

4293 2018-04-06 16:28:54 No, global tightening of monetary policy is.

4330 2018-04-06 16:17:07 Just 1 ques..is there any way to verify that our stock and funds are safe with brokerage house.... atleast if anything happens we can recover stocks nd funds.
4331 2018-04-06 16:16:48 I’m happy to see you’re stocks are tanking.  
4332 2018-04-06 16:16:31 @ScottWapnerCNBC I hat it when someone say there are plenty of buys for long-term investors. You should only be long on good stocks you already own as eventually you will have a profit.
4333 2018-04-06 16:15:52 I'm totally suggesting that. They cry if you suggest background checks. They cry if you try to eliminate bump stocks. They cry if you try to limit magazine sizes.

What other choice is left other than a full repeal? Then we can democratically decide what our gun laws should be.

4358 2018-04-06 16:04:57 It is just important to look at high dividend yield stock, it is equally important to check how much capital erosion do these stocks do? High dividend yield with least capital erosion is the best combination and also one year data does not help here.

4379 2018-04-06 15:55:36 So in the end China would lose interest income. Of course they can buy US stocks but they are already overpriced and buying them would make them more so and thats not a good deal at all. Too much money is as much of a problem as too little money.

4456 2018-04-06 15:19:22 As a shrewed businessman Trump is using his presidency to manipulate the US stock market by his flip-flopping rhetoric. His timing to buy or sell stocks to make big profits is very obvious.

4468 2018-04-06 15:16:36 $1200 loss today breaking rules. Not going with my gut, got greedy. When I take my gains conservatively the stocks keeps going my way. When I fail to take them when I know I should I get dumped on. Oh well what’s $1200 over a course of a lifetime. Biggest loss so far though.

4480 2018-04-06 15:13:10 Saying "But the bible says..." isn't going to convince anyone but the gullible. Do some research, have it peer reviewed by scientists that aren't sycophants, and then maybe you will have some credibility instead of being laughing stocks of the scientific community.
4481 2018-04-06 15:12:44 "The best stock to buy is the one you already own" - Peter Lynch

Don't diversify too much. Rather, focus on few ideas and allocate your capital in them. It takes few stocks to turn the fortunes.

4512 2018-04-06 14:59:31 Given that stocks have positive drift any shorts should be IMO opportunistic/tactical i.e. short term.
4513 2018-04-06 14:58:55 People forget just prior to John McCain losing the election, he was actually ahead in all polls against Obama.

4576 2018-04-06 14:35:42 America is not a victim.  We have the largest economy in the world.  China’s is half of ours.  

Trump is lying again.  He’s trying to justify bad decision making.  That’s why his companies always go bankrupt.  He’s bad a business.  

He’s tanking our job growth, stocks, trade..

4578 2018-04-06 14:34:58 I do agree but only take <3 months for new all time highs. It's headline risk. Actions mean a lot more than words (and need way bigger tariffs than those proposed). Trump/most politicians are bark, no bite. Did Brexit take down European stocks? Similar headline risk is my take.
4579 2018-04-06 14:34:40 What this market needs is a @realDonaldTrump tweet telling algos they're making a big mistake selling stocks on good data because the old days and stuff like that. $spy $qqq $iwm

4614 2018-04-06 14:23:36 The current method of calculating the trade deficit does not fully account for income derived from foreign sources or for US ownership of foreign stocks.
Also
A trade deficit is an indication that the currency is desired.
4615 2018-04-06 14:23:35 Nothing you can do personally besides selling, which doesn't make sense at this point.

4620 2018-04-06 14:20:38 Keep spewing that LIE. Millions of American workers have seen corporations use their tax cut to buy back stocks and pay out shareholders. And, with your tariffs and baseless attacks on your corporate enemies, stocks are down. Want to comment on that?

4701 2018-04-06 13:55:59 "All these people saying #enron is dead cuz it dropped, and yes they are dead, so I'm gonna start saying stocks are dead for the ones who are dead." Oh wait, using another weak analogy didn't work this time either.

4706 2018-04-06 13:53:16 My attraction to cheap stocks lies in the idea that their underlying businesses merely have to do okay for the stock to do very well. My revulsion of expensive stocks lies in the idea that their underlying businesses have to do very well for the stock to do okay.

4709 2018-04-06 13:52:42 Stay in stocks like UNIT. Domestic. Can’t be targeted for tariffs and in a lawsuit they will win related to WIN. Lots of risk but not tariff. Plenty of trades not susceptible to targeting. Kudlow knows it’s about posturing and the risks of failure. Past Presidents failed control.
4710 2018-04-06 13:52:23 Profit taking also means that investors no longer want to invest in companies and stocks.  Profit taking is a show of no/lost faith in companies.

4819 2018-04-06 13:02:05 Trump’s actions are speaking louder than anything media can trump up..he’s going straight at China, Russia and border control. Great day for #MAGA and stocks will follow suit .

4822 2018-04-06 13:01:17 I don't have views on particular stocks. Regarding blockchain investing, I suspect there will be a few winners & a lot of losers but am a bit surprised by the dearth of implemented business applications given the tech has been around for 9 yrs.

4828 2018-04-06 12:56:47 @FoxNews  Fails to report bottoming stocks or lower than excpected job growth. Only news allowed about @potus is FAKE cheerleading. No wonder there are so many Hillary stories, if there's no good Trump news, they can't report.
4829 2018-04-06 12:55:12 DSGT is just one of 2 stocks with low SS tht are being accumulated by the MM's using "False Stock Drop" method's which  to instill fear and uncertainty into our minds so we sell  allowing them to accumulate before huge run commences later...Its coming
4830 2018-04-06 12:55:04 This isn't a problem unique to Oakville or any other area. 
Consumers need to be realistic about: 
1) real estate market rises/falls (like stocks) 
2) stop buying beyond your means (homes, cars, vac properties & 'things')
If the bldr failed the contract, they'd be screaming.
4831 2018-04-06 12:55:01 Facebook can’t rely on their customer contract because it violates the U. S. Constitution. Oops, your stocks are really gonna fall! Collect that data and see the results!
4832 2018-04-06 12:54:42 Let's forget Sparking, Xfactor, Vanilla SF4 Revenge bar, MVC2 extra scaling and much, much more. The biggest issue Sm4sh rage has is that it carries over to stocks because it's not a traditional fighting game. But claiming it's "the worst thing ever" Na man, not even close.
4833 2018-04-06 12:54:32 Please stop this with China.  You are going to cause damage to our farmers and our stocks.  Please critically think of the consequences of this bad idea.
4834 2018-04-06 12:54:13 @Nomura: "The more the market dismisses Trump and higher stocks go, the more concerned I get surrounding his behavior—because he views the US stock market as a “scoreboard” and is thus left “emboldened to raise the stakes as he risks mis-interpreting equities rally as approval“
4835 2018-04-06 12:53:22 Good article, despite this completely inaccurate claim: “bump stocks (which convert semiautomatic weapons into illegal automatic weapons)”. Gun is still semi auto. Bump stocks physically aid pulling the trigger faster. Still one bullet for every trigger pull.
4836 2018-04-06 12:53:05 My guess is that stocks see the jobs number and trade war as keeping the Fed from raising rates. The Fed is dead, long live the Fed!

4846 2018-04-06 12:47:54 Bottom line on #NFP by Jp Morgan:
Report neutral for stocks. The add miss should be considered on a 3M basis (a solid ~200K). Wages jumped but by no more than exp and UR failed to break <4%. This report probably doesn’t dramatically alter the narrative around growth or mon policy

4849 2018-04-06 12:47:26 Arguably after one full year, he owns more of it now. Before major policies implemented, it is still the predecessor’s fallout. The more time goes, the more he should own it. Good or Bad. That said, I am not seeing many tweets about the stocks recently.
4850 2018-04-06 12:47:25 I used to do that stuff. Swing trade.. buy stocks sell them a few days, weeks, months later..

4856 2018-04-06 12:45:28 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow The March jobs report is out and it’s a miss.
In March, the economy added 103,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% for the fifth-straight month, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. AND STOCKS DOWN!

4862 2018-04-06 12:43:54 U.S. STOCK SELL-OFF PENDING?! Remember at the start of the year, we observed a large sell off for US stocks. This was heavily attributed to worries about rising wages and how this could force FOMC to act at a faster with interest rates. $spx $djia $ndx

4895 2018-04-06 12:29:09 However, U.S. stocks were able to recover sharply during the day after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow did their best to reassure the markets that there will be negotiations and that the tariffs were only a proposal at this point.
4896 2018-04-06 12:29:06 I’m ready lad...keep telling ya
4897 2018-04-06 12:28:54 U.S. stocks started Wed sharply lower after China surprised the markets by quickly announcing equal-sized retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products in response to the Trump administration's announcement late Tues of its list of $50 billion worth of Chinese products subject to tariffs.
4898 2018-04-06 12:28:49 The Dow has absolutely nothing to do with citizen economy. That money is value that is not used within the economy its just the level of profit for trade insiders. If stocks fall there is always a buyer catching that chance.

4906 2018-04-06 12:23:58 My point is not that the opposite is true, but that the thesis is questionable, and most research on trump tweet impact on stocks says it may trivially exist, but only very very short term. Policy impacts stocks, not tweets. And trumps tweet/policy relationship is not strong.

4926 2018-04-06 12:12:07 My secret to making money  1. Trump talks tariffs.  2. Liberals panicked and sell off stocks. 3 buy on the bottom. Last 4 months I have grown my portfolio 73%!  Pray everyday he talks tariffs or in general aggravates the liberals in this country!

4930 2018-04-06 12:10:47 The return of the Tariff Tantrum is holding back stocks’ advance, but market performance in the face of tariff fears signals their underlying strength.
4931 2018-04-06 12:10:42 They don't even have to. Just stopping or even  slowing the amount they buy would be crippling. Chinese investors also own billions in US stock market. Dumping some tech, energy and healthcare stocks would also send market into tailspin.
4932 2018-04-06 12:09:38 @JeffDSachs we can solve the stock market with a buy-hold strategy. Invest in 50-120 stocks in highest growth sectors (computer security and AI) and only in the stocks growing at the fastest rates. Then we can convince people to invest in this way and give some to charity.

4937 2018-04-06 12:05:17 No doubt that we need tighter, common sense laws. Better background vetting, ban bump stocks, and ban assault rifles. You don’t need a machine gun to hunt deer. Keep your handgun and rifle. No issue there.
4938 2018-04-06 12:05:12 Bulls bitching and moaning about Trump is probably one of the most humorous things I've seen/heard in a long long time. How they flocked to buy stocks starting election night, run $DJI up 8000 points, and NOW, they start crying!
4939 2018-04-06 12:04:41 @Morning_Joe Hey Joe, Stock Markets projected to open at another low. Anyone think Trumps (or friends)are  making lots $$ by shorting the market? The bigger the trade war with China  the more money  $$ someone shorting stocks would make? Fishy?

You forgotten that stocks stop going up when P/E"s hit 25 times. Amazon and Netflix are now +200 times earnings and it is questionable if they are profitable.

5353 2018-04-06 06:25:16 US equity stocks posted a three-day winning streak as trade war concerns eased  somewhat and investors focused on the upcoming earnings season. However, Trump’s newly-proposed tariffs is likely to weigh on stocks and emerging-market currencies.
5354 2018-04-06 06:24:45 Never underestimate Trump's lust for money, power & fame. He would sell every inch of this nation if he could profit. Don't forget, a couple of his "associates" dumped million$ in steel stocks just before Trump announce steel tariffs. He's not smart. He's greedy & vindictive.
5355 2018-04-06 06:23:15 People should use the suffix .AX (Australian Exchange) when posting about ASX stocks. I often get results from other exchanges I'm not interested in. e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, etc. For instance $AYR should be $AYR.AX, $CBA should be $CBA.AX, $AVL should be $AVL.AX

5456 2018-04-06 04:59:39 So if you plan to have 10 stocks, have each stock 10% at cost. If 15 stocks, each stock 7-8% at cost. If the stock rises to say 25% market value, cut it a bit back to around 15-20%. This way you sleep peacefully while staying owner in the good quality business. 2/2

5543 2018-04-06 03:39:54 Yep, and also AR-15's shouldn't be sold to civilians, bump stocks should be banned, magazine limits, & universal background checks with meticulously kept records required for all gun purchases, none of which would deny law-abiding citizens the collective right to bare arms.
5544 2018-04-06 03:39:43 Stocks are riskier investments but they grow more. Bonds are safer and they grow less. Hence, the fund invests you aggressively when you’re young, and then shifts you to a more conservative portfolio as you get closer to needing the money.
5545 2018-04-06 03:39:43 Lol nah they’re all confusing until you learn the language of investing.  Essentially, the line graph is showing you how the fund gets more conservative as you age and get closer to retirement in year 2060. The fund will shift money from stocks to bonds over time.
5546 2018-04-06 03:39:42 You’re invested in stocks all over the world. 60% US, 9% Canada & Latin America 18% Europe, 13% Asia. Hope that helps
5547 2018-04-06 03:38:09 How nice it is when your colleague make coffee for you in the morning thinking you really need one.. and that too from her personal stocks #ifeelloved
5548 2018-04-06 03:37:53 I don’t doubt it’s technology or blockchain tech but it is new and to mislead people into thinking that it’s safer then stocks, bonds, mutual funds is just reckless. It’s very risky and can be very rewarding for the level of risk taken.

5677 2018-04-06 02:14:58 Dude are you on crack? It’s people like you who puts high expectations for stocks...and people get disappointed did you see cybx start st $1 or move $2??? This stock will be around .70-.80 max start and then go down to .50-.60
5678 2018-04-06 02:14:14 any other stocks?  plz contact.
5679 2018-04-06 02:13:53 His friends sold their stocks before 4.
5680 2018-04-06 02:11:34 Las Vegas -guns, bump stocks, tracer rounds all bought legally. Parkland gun and extended mags bought legally, Ft.lauderdale airport gun bought and transported legally, Pulse shooter - guns bought legally.
5681 2018-04-06 02:10:52 I have been wondering the same thing. It was odd that his rich buddies sold steel related stocks right before he tweeted regarding his tariffs.
5682 2018-04-06 02:09:41 F&O Ban

    No stocks in ban list.

Put-Call Ratio

    Nifty PCR at 1.42 versus 1.33.
    Nifty Bank PCR at 1.96 versus 0.99.
5683 2018-04-06 02:09:12 Stocks, as in the Dow and S&P, rose for the 3rd day straight. Nice fake headline.
5684 2018-04-06 02:08:29 Who said anything about chains? I live in NYC and every local pizza place in walking distance stocks pineapple for Hawaiian slices.
5685 2018-04-06 02:08:25 Earlier suggested stocks r creating big wealth just chk what u want more .
5686 2018-04-06 02:08:15 "that’s why things seem so incoherent. One day Trump talks tough on trade, then stocks fall, and his advisers scramble to say that the trade war won’t really happen, then he worries that he’s looking weak, and tweets out more threats"
5687 2018-04-06 02:06:57 well that's my answer to your question if 200 NQ pts fits your notional risk, then you can scale and play ranges as long as it fits the risk model. Something I was attempting to explain with futures.  I traded stocks/options for 18 years and I could trade FB %5-10 wide w/ options
5688 2018-04-06 02:06:01 Find myself playing Defense against Trump rather than the markets. #stocks @jimcramer
5689 2018-04-06 02:05:27 Confused by 2 things:

1. Zero reaction on this overseas 2.  Stocks up 200 points 3 days ago on the same news right?
5690 2018-04-06 02:05:15 Hope a lot of you bought stocks today! Lol. Trump will help you out by tweeting! Lol.
5691 2018-04-06 02:05:09 A whack job! What is congress doing. Pretty scary. And then Stocks.  Like a bull in a China shop, no pun intended...he breaks everything.
5692 2018-04-06 02:04:49 100 shares of Facebook is around $15k. Let it sit for a few years and it will most likely double. You don’t need $50k. Buy stocks in things you use like google, amazon, and in companies that control and distribute water and electricity.
5693 2018-04-06 02:03:41 Yup! Definitely getting loaded rn
5694 2018-04-06 02:03:31 Too much cash in hands of workers after tax cuts  Once infrastructure funds are in place look for cigarettes and beer stocks 
5695 2018-04-06 02:03:08 I suspect that this high stakes trade policy poker game will eventually turn out positive for stocks as Trump has all the leverage to force China to start playing ball on trade on our terms
5696 2018-04-06 02:02:33 Glad I sold three quarters of my stocks in my portfolio and put the money in savings. Probably going to get worst before it gets better.

5698 2018-04-06 02:00:14 Investor should shown the Hospital stocks. They have become killers than live savers.
5699 2018-04-06 02:00:02 Even my husband's family kind of asks me for financial advice about stocks and property investments and stuff like that, as if I should somehow either know myself or have an inside connection or something.  I just moved to this country a year ago. IDK? (Canada). I'm like, REALLY?
5700 2018-04-06 01:59:42 You spent many years in the military.... let me ask you this.... how many people in this country do you want to have access to ar-15’s.... high capacity magazines... bump stocks... how much training did you have on those types of weapons before you could use?

It was only short covering yday and this is how short covering happens. Thats y I asked small traders to stay away. Prepare for two large swings in next 5-6 sessions. Positional derivative trades not advisable.

5709 2018-04-06 01:55:08 @Dannyhais $SPY You mean the way it was in play yesterday?  We went long on stocks yesterday. Those that bought $UVXY then, crushed.  :)
5710 2018-04-06 01:54:28 Just to be clear, ETFs are Stocks that can be bought & sold on stock market. What I meant is, that has no correlation with Dow Jones or S&P. So there is no issue here. We are both both good.
5711 2018-04-06 01:53:46 I think you will see a majority of stocks retest their respecive DTLs they broke out of yesterday/today. Throwbacks to retest previous resistance (horizontal or diagonal) are totally normal, even if they're swift and violent.
5712 2018-04-06 01:53:23 Bump stocks will be the least of our probs.

5714 2018-04-06 01:50:56 Honestly, he probably would. He ended up being quite an astute businessman especially trading stocks. 

He also might have really enjoyed the irony... But that's just speculation on my part. 
5715 2018-04-06 01:50:56 Somebody dig up what we can on Scott Pruitt, #Trump might be replacing Sessions with him, #Marijuana stocks might run this summer

5717 2018-04-06 01:49:48 Can’t just stick to stocks can you?
5718 2018-04-06 01:49:17 131 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.

私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
5719 2018-04-06 01:48:37 The law makers were voted in by the people. We need to vote these crap heads out. And have the laws corrected or removed. Keep them bump stocks they suck anyway. But yes you should be allowed to have one.
5720 2018-04-06 01:47:31 Then your issue should be with the bump stocks and not the AR. The AR is still not an assault rifle, the only thing that makes it shoot like one is the bump stock. But even then, you are still limited by the rounds in the magazine.
5721 2018-04-06 01:46:53 I would like to thank all the idiots and Algos for selling stocks. Can't wait to buy more tomorrow! Also thank you @POTUS !
5722 2018-04-06 01:45:28 QE 4 that now looks around the corner when China dumps our debt will defiantly include buying corporate debt and stocks . We are Japan but they don’t know it yet.
5723 2018-04-06 01:44:51 So you got a raise? The people in your town are all employed? The way he treats women is ok with you? You like all the name calling and degrading of people he doesn’t like? You feel like he’s made America Great? Do you own stocks?
5724 2018-04-06 01:44:08 It's the biggest reason retail stocks have been a "no fly zone" for investors for years, and you're seeing looming bankruptcies for Barnes and Noble, K-Mart/Sears, JC Penney, etc. Hell, even Target and Nordstroms are struggling at a time when Amazon is rising, NOT a coincidence
5725 2018-04-06 01:43:45 Normally I just like to bust bubble stocks, hit n run.
5726 2018-04-06 01:43:06 “Because I just put ALL my funds into the VIX, the stock market volatility measure. With my brilliant economic policies, this stock market is CERTAIN to put everyone in a roller-coaster whiplash. But my friends and I (Kudlow, Icahn, Navarro) can get rich, shorting stocks. WINNING
5727 2018-04-06 01:42:39 I just never looked at shop and blackberry, I have no idea what those stocks are going to do
5728 2018-04-06 01:42:34 Somehow I became interested in the stock market and I found a stock that seems to go up when other stocks are falling. That’s my kinda stock for sure
5729 2018-04-06 01:42:16 Top level insight on the game aside, I still got 110 percent on you as Sheik and you killed me both stocks at 30. 

So

I got cheated out of my hard work
5730 2018-04-06 01:41:09 Stocks were up today. The hell you talking about?
5731 2018-04-06 01:40:50 I suspect that the people he fooled into voting for him don't even know what shorting stocks and trading futures are.
5732 2018-04-06 01:40:33 It was too you because Kurt eichenwald said he sold all his kids stocks because Trump was elected, so kurt wouldn't think this is funny
5733 2018-04-06 01:39:19 I think so. I play stocks since 2000 and I am never been curious about options.
5734 2018-04-06 01:39:17 There are people who invest in stocks, and there are people who invest in stories. Be the kind that invests in stories. Be the kind that invests in life.
5735 2018-04-06 01:39:15 Obviously you are not a stockholder. Let me give you a lesson. Stocks go up and sometimes they go down

5740 2018-04-06 01:36:23 Thanks I'd love to know what stocks Trump and his administration have . Just my opinion but we all know everything Trump does is for .
5741 2018-04-06 01:36:12 Was watchin a program where they said the serin nerve agent attack was the syrian goverment?? Knowing putin is totally corrupt & russia is envolved in that conflict and they aint shy using serin in the past?? My moneys on russia disposing of excess serin stocks in syria

5743 2018-04-06 01:36:05 I have found a ton of stocks reasonably priced. Not in tech, but financials, some industrials

5749 2018-04-06 01:33:32 BTW, is anyone checking to see who’s shorting Amazon and some of the other stocks Trump tanks? Betcha someone is.

5756 2018-04-06 01:28:32 A class action lawsuit should be filed against POTUS for using his office intentionally drive down the market to hurt peoples 401ks. Someone should check to see if he is shorting stocks before he hammers them. That would be insider trading
5757 2018-04-06 01:28:20 I bet he sold his stocks prior

5762 2018-04-06 01:26:49 Why isn't Congress demanding to see Trump family investment portfolios???

5763 2018-04-06 01:26:45 Rachel is just talking about him now but in relation to Pruitt. I’d bet money he shorted Amazon stocks.

5765 2018-04-06 01:26:20 Stocks will tank tomorrow
5766 2018-04-06 01:26:08 I have a sincere concern for what makes a sitting President so (allegedly) well-versed in business and stocks decided when to try to damage the stock value of a given business. It's blatant economic intimidation. That troubles me.

That said, Lockheed can indeed go fuck itself.
5767 2018-04-06 01:25:28 Less than 50% of Americans own stocks, most own none at all.

The majority do stock in America is held by less than 10% of the population
5768 2018-04-06 01:25:23 If stocks are actually valued reasonably we wouldnt worry about any of this!  Instead every analyst is valuing stocks by extrapolating growth 5 years out and assuming no recessions
5769 2018-04-06 01:24:58 I'm fairly sure those guys take money to boost draft stocks. Anyone that blogs about, reports on, or a fan of the #49ers has their board slightly skewed towards EDGE. Objectivity goes out the door.

That its more likely stocks like $PCL go up in the event of a higher murder rate? Because death can be quantified to reflect the future revenue streams?
5779 2018-04-06 01:17:08 AR 15's are actually MARKETED as assault rifles. Bump stocks (legal) turn them into assault rifles. So you're playing semantics. With a bump stock, you hold your finger down, the gun keeps shooting. End of story.
5780 2018-04-06 01:16:22 I guarantee 90 % of Trump supporters don't know what shorting stocks  or puts  or futures actually mean.  The shift of wealth is happening right in front of our eyes.
5781 2018-04-06 01:16:19 Maybe someone should check if someone happened to short those same companies’ stocks at the same time
5782 2018-04-06 01:15:59 He probably is shorting stocks

5808 2018-04-06 01:05:16 What’s the best way to buy single stocks now? Etrade? Or some other new hotness.
5809 2018-04-06 01:03:01 Is Trump blowing off steam when he attacks an American company & causing its stocks to plunge? Just asking bc no US company can be safe from this mad king’s wrath. Cc: @amazon @Boeing @Toyota @LockheedMartin @GM
5810 2018-04-06 01:02:35 Day trading is super risky yet rewarding, if you're not a pro and I know most aren't. Only use 10% of your investment funds for that. Anymore than that is idiotic.

The rest you split between crypto holds, stocks & bonds and physical assets. No more than 75% for one

#btc #invest
5811 2018-04-06 01:02:31 Neither at this point. Job numbers matter bc it could accelerate Fed rate hiking. US Economy strong, weak numbers would be better. But with a full on trade war imminent, stocks will be crushed regardless. Risk-off. Watch bond markets...
5812 2018-04-06 01:01:31 Thanks to our fearless idiot-in-chief, ol' Donald Dumpy, stocks are going to get hit hard tomorrow thanks to another $100 billion in tariffs...
5813 2018-04-06 01:01:30 Kinda like when RIA's think they are fulfilling fiduciary standards because of their investment process without doing the client level due dilligence?  When was the last time you reviewed a client's living will or auto insurance declaration page? More to FP than stocks and bonds

5815 2018-04-06 00:59:48 going to be investing some money into some stocks this summer 
5816 2018-04-06 00:57:35 Many will survive imo because the old system of stocks will be replaced by blockchain/crypto coins
5817 2018-04-06 00:57:34 Hmmm I am not even sure what’s better for stocks strong or weak number. Strong January number didn’t work out very well.
5818 2018-04-06 00:56:38 Bump stocks are useless, it’s not even an inch.
5819 2018-04-06 00:55:57 To be honest how is this important News?????? Honestly Americans want to know what is going to happen with healthcare, stocks and quality of life. No cares about scandals anymore especially when it’s a way of life nowadays!
5820 2018-04-06 00:55:08 @realsardenberg sorry to say but tomorrow’s opening in Brazilian markets will be the opposite of what you said @GNEmpauta : stocks down and USD up! #EmergingMarkets
5821 2018-04-06 00:54:39 They already are though. The Late Model Stocks are their baby. They exist in the Carolinas and Virginia as the NASCAR Division 1 race car. They are the sanctioning body in those parts.

5823 2018-04-06 00:52:58 So you know how like gangster thug people post pictures of them with like hundreds of dollars in their hands? There should be a white version of that where people just post screenshots of like their stocks and IRA’s.
5824 2018-04-06 00:52:50 Someone needs to check if he is helping a big investor with these statements causing these swings. Check any of his friends to see if they shorted any stocks before the market closed today. And about an hour in tomorrow Kudlow will calm the market and we swing up.
5825 2018-04-06 00:52:39 "Oh, stocks are up today?  Let's screw it up again."
5826 2018-04-06 00:51:58 I'm just trading stocks, not using much of any leverage ... so the idea of "notional value" is foreign to me.
5827 2018-04-06 00:51:36 While I like that idea it will take a long time .   The nra is embedded in our society in ways people don’t realize . We unknowingly fund them in our pensions - stocks and Iras thru gun/ ammo manufacturing and retailers that sell guns.  Boy Scouts and rotc .
5828 2018-04-06 00:49:33 The ultimate growth stock is one with 30% or more earnings growth, with that growth being more or less a straight line if you plotted it on paper. Couple that with deep liquidity and you have a growth-related institution's dream. E.g. $HD $WMT in their earlier days #stocks
5829 2018-04-06 00:49:28 You’re about 9 years late on getting them man lol. I always here about how good their stocks are.
5830 2018-04-06 00:48:52 You only cut taxes for the top 1%.  And most are using the $ for stocks, not to hire.  (Now that you’ve caused stocks to fall they may not be as happy with you.). The rest of us are screwed!
5831 2018-04-06 00:48:52 Russia, who insisted they had destroyed all stocks of Novichok,  now deny that they have ever produced it. Something doesn't add up there, does it? 
5832 2018-04-06 00:48:46 Stocks down since the deficit exploded by Trump and the Supply Side GOPers because... We need to finance a trillion dollars of debt every year until Democrat regain control... Which is how it ALWAYS is.
5833 2018-04-06 00:48:35 @GOP it’s time you stand up to @realDonaldTrump his big fat mouth is costing Americans millions in stocks and now he’s on the verge of destroying farmers. Wake the F up!!!
5834 2018-04-06 00:48:31 Why is stock market acting so poorly whenever Trump threatens tariffs?  Why do investors sell their stocks if Dotard Donnie says tariffs are good for business?  Maybe Dementia Donnie has to stop watching InfoWars and Breitbart and stop listening to fake PHd's like Gorka.
5835 2018-04-06 00:48:30 Shoot, next we'll be burning Witches at the stake if these folks keep going.  I do know a few GOP and Alt Christians I would like to put in stocks in the town square though.

5837 2018-04-06 00:47:22 ETFs are trusted bundled stocks?

That would mean BTC would be bundled with other coins? and stocks? Giving it mass adoption.
5838 2018-04-06 00:46:05 Dude, I'm sorry for your stocks but the video is AWESOME!!! Really, it's great! Jokes aside, I changed my strategy and that's why I'm not going crazy, but beyond that...it's pure madness!!
5839 2018-04-06 00:43:51 I was just saying this to colleagues.

I have no evidence, but suspect people are shorting stocks w/advanced knowledge of @realDonaldTrump's plans to attack businesses. They can then sell on the bounce, rinse, & repeat.
@NBCNews
@CNN
@ABC

5840 2018-04-06 00:42:20 Is he shorting stocks? Curious to see how much get gains from this crapshowmanship.
5841 2018-04-06 00:41:41 ...I first learned about this w/ $HD. From the '87 crash through '92 it went up 28 times. After that, despite earnings being quite solid, price flatlined for the next four yrs. Good learning experience for me as I held it during '91 and '92. #stocks

5843 2018-04-06 00:41:27 Asia AM Digest: Trade War Fears Kept Falling, USD and CAD Rose
Another day of ebbing trade war fears thanks to US officials helped push stocks and the US Dollar higher. It couldn’t beat the Canadian Dollar which was helped by NAFTA development...
5844 2018-04-06 00:41:21 Funny that @realDonaldTrump isn't running out to take credit for tanking the stock market.  He was more than happy to take credit for the leftover goodwill that kept stocks going up post-Obama.  Remember that? When we had a REAL President, not an infantile moron?
5845 2018-04-06 00:40:16 Or if he had stocks the advanced knowledge that he was going to tank the markets sure could have worked to his advantage.   I think that’s illegal unless you’re @POTUS
5846 2018-04-06 00:40:03 As I posted before, I think dividend paying stocks perform better because the demand to own those stocks is increased by the false impression that people have that dividends are the same as interest. They think the dividend is new money they didn't have before it was paid.
5847 2018-04-06 00:39:56 No,  I am not.  I am one of the people you love to brag that you are helping... but you are not.  .@realDonaldTrump you have tanked my stocks /401. You are the ruin of America and if you don't resign soon.... Your takedown will be brutal! #VotingYourAssOut

5850 2018-04-06 00:37:56 What did Hannity learn at dinner Sat night. Did Hannity encourage tariffs in order to sell his or his buddy's stocks high and buy low? Trump can't help himself and people can make a lot of money manipulating him."conman
5851 2018-04-06 00:36:23 Those investors will buy up the shares until they believe that the stocks are valued appropriately. In effect you transfer wealth from people who do care to those who don't, and history has shown you don't do much to harm the company you're divesting from.
5852 2018-04-06 00:35:52 1% will profit the most, the rest will get little or nothing; meanwhile #Prexy's erratic behavior frightens investors, tanks the markets, and we watch stocks and retirement savings melt away  (as a youngster, you might consider wars
5853 2018-04-06 00:35:34 Yes, why else would his "friends" talk to him if not for stock tips so they can short steel or bank stocks, etc.

5855 2018-04-06 00:35:03 I think they’ll be hot but I see rip city in stocks
5856 2018-04-06 00:35:00 I still can't get past the fact that traders spent the past two days boosting stocks on the theory that Trump would somehow suddenly stop being stupid.
5857 2018-04-06 00:34:56 My recommendation is to buy stocks... he's intentionally getting the market to drop... then right before the election... boom ... deal done;stock market goes thru the roof and Republicans supporting Trump get elected. Blue wave  stopped! Keep ur eye  on the ball  folks!!!
5858 2018-04-06 00:33:51 That is also not taking into account the number of per capita gun or knife deaths in the UK versus the US. However, guns can be dangerous in the wrong hands. I am fine with banning bump stocks. My point is that if someone wants to be a mass murderer, they will find a way
5859 2018-04-06 00:32:04 Stocks close with solid gains as trade war fears ease.
5860 2018-04-06 00:32:01 Selling off my stocks. There will be a crash!!!!

5862 2018-04-06 00:30:12 Ahahaha the new proposed tariffs really killed my stocks  I hope it's like the other day where they bounced back up.

5866 2018-04-06 00:28:56 Is it not illegal for a POTUS to manipulate stock markets like @realDonaldTrump.   Markets closed high in NY on basis of moderate prospects of trade war.  Trump sells stocks then threatens to triple tariffs.   #sacktrump #cnn #foxnews

5868 2018-04-06 00:27:56 Lol i had the same feeling today. Something just didn't feel right. Saw Rachels tweet abt 2672 being a wall and also your reply abt most stocks feel like they have a lid over. Hedged my longs with a bunch of uvxy calls expiring next week. Should be flat tomm. 
5869 2018-04-06 00:25:29 Stocks trending negatively on April 2nd and the first was on a Sunday.  Got it.  #aprilfool
5870 2018-04-06 00:24:57 Most of the ppl selling stocks tonight dont even know why they are selling it, or what the real implication of this new tariff is... they just sell because trade war sounds scary
5871 2018-04-06 00:24:37 haha...just another dip! all jokes aside, I'll take the hit to stocks for putting China in line.
5872 2018-04-06 00:23:38 In typical Donald Trump fashion, he's trying to get out of paying his debts, this time with China. #trump #donaldtrump #gop #maga #potus #draintheswamp #stocks #auspol #stockmarkets #DJIA #stockmarket #StockMarketCrash
5873 2018-04-06 00:23:23 Did KTVN ask Heller about his support for Trumps sexcapades, lies, payoffs, public land and enviro threats, falling stocks, trade wars, fake immigrant invasions?  Trumps attacks on the free press, courts, states rights, free markets (Amazon), DACA kids?
5874 2018-04-06 00:22:26 The rest of the country will be receiving pink slips due to the tariffs and the way they were announced! Then let’s talk about our stock market and the stocks our president attacks personally which is different then a industry comment.Wake up America #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance
5875 2018-04-06 00:22:14 That one 1 coco full basket mindset would have worked like a charm. When I just started $1k-3k could get me between pulse @$0.33, burger @$3.26, jetcon was about $0.75 and jse @ $2.88. All these stocks were major winners.

5880 2018-04-06 00:20:51 Trump and Xi are buds remember they played golf. They'll probly reciprocate like they did last time with 1/10 of tariff's to US that Trump proposes on them. odds of trade war that impact global economy less than 5%; why stocks did  V recovery after China announced US tariffs #BTD
5881 2018-04-06 00:20:49 And while they're at it, check out how/why Trump's buddy, Carl Icahn, dumped $32 MILLION in steel stocks days before tariffs were announced?
5882 2018-04-06 00:19:36 Lots of stocks still for a $1 still
5883 2018-04-06 00:19:21 You are probably right. There should be an investigation into who sold off stocks right before each one of his #TariffTantrums

5893 2018-04-06 00:16:20 POTUS didn’t mention tariffs that wld send stocks plummeting and farmers wondering what to do? He’s making it great again alright....
5894 2018-04-06 00:15:53 100 billion will be added to #realDonaldTrump Trade War with China, it's like a no limit poker game with endless bets.

5902 2018-04-06 00:09:58 Typical... wooo hoo, finally someone thinks I am normal... thanks for the compliment 
But to your point, the best results are looking at both sides of the picture, Both fundamentally and technically... for stocks I am more so known for the technical aspect of things.
5903 2018-04-06 00:09:49 It’s disgusting to use art like stocks and bonds.  You’re what’s wrong with the art world.
5904 2018-04-06 00:08:56 Didn't Trump say that he had divested himself of his stocks? Almost like he is trying to crash the markets so he can get back in.
5905 2018-04-06 00:08:34 Asia stocks begin mixed as region digests the positive lead from Wall St and the resurfacing of trade concerns after Trump ordered consideration of another USD 100bln of tariffs on China; ASX 200 (Unch), Nikkei 225 (+0.3%), KOSPI (-0.6%)
5906 2018-04-06 00:08:20 Congress should not be allowed to hold stock in anything but mutual funds and US bonds; stocks in a private company could lead to a conflict of interest.
5907 2018-04-06 00:08:17 European stocks posted the best one-day gain in nearly two years as trade war concerns weren’t enough to stop a rotation towards perceived risky assets.

5910 2018-04-06 00:06:36 It’s fun time in market. China goes with tariffs on Monday’s, Trump on Thursday’s. In between we have tech stocks like FB, TSLA, AMZN tweets etc playing their own music. Futures dancing to the tune of these dramas in market. Interesting times.
5911 2018-04-06 00:05:38 Which stocks are DT and friends shorting?

5915 2018-04-06 00:04:26 If you own stocks, hold on to your hat tomorrow.  Stocks are going to fall. Trump is going to impose more tariffs.
5916 2018-04-06 00:04:24 9. Did I cover that reasonably enough?  I tried. Mind you WA State  laws are pretty strict and okay with me.  My opinions are mine and definitely not the same as others.  Also I support making bump stocks illegal.  I'm also a NRA member.  Common sense needs to reign.
5917 2018-04-06 00:04:01 @realDonaldTrump EXAMPLE: my great grandfather was GOING to be a doctor then the market crashed *they lost EVERYTHING* BE CAREFUL w/ what ur doing :( we still have boxes of old stocks that r ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS
