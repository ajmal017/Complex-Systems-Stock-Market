6 2018-01-18 23:58:46 Does the pouring coconut oil on your bills help? I’m asking for a friend 
7 2018-01-18 23:58:31 Totally right. I think, a complete boycott will set these sort of companies straight. For profit they'll go to any length!

47 2018-01-18 23:56:22 You’re still neglecting other savings. Over 100k miles you’re going to save nearly $10k in fuel costs. Plus, no oil changes. No tune ups. Etc.

49 2018-01-18 23:55:57 The CIA (Kermit Roosevelt specifically) overthrew the democraticly elected Mossedegh bc he nationalized Iran's  oil industry. Prior to that the AIC/England took 90% or more of profit. He closed the British embassy, so their good buddy helped install the puppet Shah. 1/

56 2018-01-18 23:54:55 If there is a government shut down it can be sourced to Donald Trump and his obsession with a Wall. 
I wish he had obsessed on Healthcare. Remember healthcare for all Americans, better coverage, cheaper?
Instead of healthcare we got snake oil.
57 2018-01-18 23:54:35 I'll take him seriously when he announces he has one car left which is a Civic, has sunk the yacht to the bottom of the ocean so it doesn't consume more oil, and stops jetting around to movie premieres
58 2018-01-18 23:54:28 Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t bring enough oil to last all night?

89 2018-01-18 23:50:24 No it doesn't. It's too damn big already. We are NOT the world police. And we should not be. Invading other countries is WRONG. These wars were never about spreading democracy, it's been about oil . . . resources. I say no to budget increases except for the VA and vets.
90 2018-01-18 23:49:48 Agreed, yet #crude oil prices drop. I am genuinely interested in your opinion as to why?

102 2018-01-18 23:48:36 I have a honey mustard marinade that’s similar and could easily be on salad as well: olive oil, sherry vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, thyme, lots of garlic, salt, pepper. Also: sherry vinegar > red wine vinegar in most cases, use it when the latter is called for
103 2018-01-18 23:48:12 Why is jiffy lube taking an hour and a half for my oil change 
104 2018-01-18 23:48:05 When someone says something "better not happen", that implies there will be a consequence delivered if it does. But, hey, you do you.
105 2018-01-18 23:48:05 You won't enjoy a fight with me...move along.

110 2018-01-18 23:46:43 Sounded like an ultimatum to me.
111 2018-01-18 23:46:30 Hahaha you could have done the one job! The initial job was changing the battery and replacing oil gaskets.
112 2018-01-18 23:46:27 Oh so I just was told castor oil will send you in labor! My friend did it and the next day she had her baby lol
113 2018-01-18 23:46:23 I’m not  when they get wet, it’s gonna be motor oil 
114 2018-01-18 23:46:13 Olive oil and whole grain mustard is the fastest one I can think of. Lovely on lambs lettuce/corn salad and avocado.
Or get yourself a bottle walnut oil and just bung it on anything.
115 2018-01-18 23:46:11 this oil smell soo good
116 2018-01-18 23:46:05 When we compare like 4 like same amount of oil Norway kept theirs public Thatcher sold BP of there is an independent report that shows we as a nation lost 400 billion.Norway now has a sovereign fund worth a trillion that one alone shows how we've been ripped off Christina

122 2018-01-18 23:45:23 ไม่มีแพลน เพราะไม่มีแฟน 5555555
123 2018-01-18 23:44:56 FWIW That picture wasn’t MCT oil (I mean, it basically is, but he claims it’s something uniquely different. I’m doubtful of that claim). And here’s MCT oil (the kind I buy) for half the money.
124 2018-01-18 23:44:22 My fave: I mix together a couple tbsps of mayo with a couple tbsps of olive oil to emulsify it. Mix in the juice from one lemon and one finely chopped shallot and a good squeeze of honey. Lots of fresh ground pepper to finish!
125 2018-01-18 23:44:17 Oil will not be around forever. Then what?
126 2018-01-18 23:44:16 They're destroying our rain forests to plant coconut trees for oil including palm. Just sayin
127 2018-01-18 23:44:15 My latest healing oil spray "Fa'Tah" smells so good and works wonders when massaged into the skin. 
Order your bottle today!
128 2018-01-18 23:44:12 Drinking oil is the new fiji
129 2018-01-18 23:43:52 I push back - 
Read up on the effects of 
specifically MCT oil and it's ability to raise blood ketone levels which is what we're talking about here - and difference between C8, C6, C10 and C12 oils. Caprylic Acid or C8 is what brain octane is which is a purified version of MCT
130 2018-01-18 23:43:44 Try adding minced garlic to olive oil, letting it sit for a bit, then remove garlic before using the oil.
131 2018-01-18 23:43:37 they did the same thing to W
132 2018-01-18 23:43:24 They're fried in vegetable oil...

137 2018-01-18 23:42:52 It took 3 1/2 hours just to get a oil change and wiper blades. Wtf
138 2018-01-18 23:42:41 I make these all the time. Hated brussel sprouts until I learned to cook them like this. Only thing I do differently is swap out the olive oil for bacon grease  #bacononeverything #lchf

142 2018-01-18 23:42:32 Hope this coconut oil stops me from going bald 
143 2018-01-18 23:42:22 But now, some “men of God” coerce followers into buying “miracle agents” like holy water, anointing oil, miracle water, miracle pendants... That means what is supposed to be free gift from God is now for sale. SHAME!
144 2018-01-18 23:42:20 Will never forget when Kim was on The Real &Tamera asked how she keeps her "blonde hair" so luscious& glossy&Kim was like 'i like douse it in coconut oil every night before bed"n they were all like wow  honestly such premium acting for a cable show, A+
145 2018-01-18 23:42:08 Note the "emergency managers" in Michigan and other areas. Note the use of debt and defunding to create conditions in which this can occur. Note the creation of $20 trillion of national debt through bailouts and wars for oil...set-up for a power grab and massive privatization.
146 2018-01-18 23:42:06 And oil is their only export and it's CHEAP as dirt now...... they don't have anything that's healthy in their economy anymore...  and you are right, Putin NEVER had any abilities, he's not responsible for the billionaires there, it's all oil! xo

148 2018-01-18 23:42:00 Nooo I love oil
149 2018-01-18 23:41:59 Priscilla, if you want to see evil and you are against evil, go to Biafra and see how Biafran Jews and Christians are slaughtered daily by British supported jihadists for oil. Even Pregnant women are killed and the unborn cut out of their belly. SILENCE!
150 2018-01-18 23:41:55 sorry dude - leave the branding out of it (which is your point) and read up on the effects of MCT oil.

155 2018-01-18 23:41:26 They refuse to acknowledge he's the president apparently. I noticed this too. Never heard Obama NOT referred to as president. But there's "no bias" and they're "fair to everyone".
156 2018-01-18 23:41:10 Next, the seasoning oil.
157 2018-01-18 23:41:01 Thoughts on the day so far: How can anyone fall for that snake oil sales job he did today in Pennsylvania? @NicolleDWallace Did you notice how he slithered out of answering the question on steel workers? Check the vid. Finally, the @GOP can't govern.
158 2018-01-18 23:41:00 Oooh yes! If you have a jar of pepperoncini that’s all used up, SAVE THE BRINE. Add olive oil or avocado oil (three parts oil to one part brine) and season it with any seasoning salt you prefer (I like Cavender) and shake it up. You can keep the dressing in the pepper jar!

162 2018-01-18 23:40:40 Bitch my mama would break your bitch ass. You can’t even change a flat tire or your own oil. My mama can, what could you possibly do for her with your  dick.
163 2018-01-18 23:40:29 I'm sorry for my soon to be ex premier.
I need to point out that his once pure flatlander blood has been contaminated by Alberta oil cash.
Other than that.
Go Riders.
Go potash.

167 2018-01-18 23:39:51 I like roasting it in the oven with some olive oil, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Or with parmesan cheese.
168 2018-01-18 23:39:09 Don't we all.

I don't really care what he's getting paid, I'd rather the club's money goes to Sanchez than to banks or the leprechauns in Tampa.

But I'm not having a fucking oil team that recently spent £120m on full backs acting like the moral authority on fees/wages, lol.

172 2018-01-18 23:38:44 If you want to make to make aoli blend 24 egg yolks, one whole egg, 1 table spoon white vinegar and garlic, big pinch of salt and pepper, slowly add vegetable oil while blending until it's thick as you want. Add previous ingredients to taste as well as some parsley. Basic aoli.
173 2018-01-18 23:38:33 @jonvhernandez My company is Health Canada Licensed for Controlled Substances, and we would be interested in testing (for free) the CBD Oil for the pug owners if they wish to know the full profile of the oil given if they are interested. We can provide any company info required.

176 2018-01-18 23:38:07 Coal and oil are destroying our ecosystems and toxic air and water pollution, Climate Change effects are making places uninhabitable for innocent wildlife as well as human societies.

179 2018-01-18 23:37:57 It is an idiotic idea. Not just how tall it has to be for oil supertankers but also the giant containerships, but the storms in the Channel would make it impassable in bad weather. Which is why they opted for a tunnel the first time around too.
180 2018-01-18 23:37:56 Ans they asked if you needed the water or oil checked AND cleaned the windshield!
181 2018-01-18 23:37:55 Standard at my house is 2-4 tbsp vinegar (balsamic or white/red wine) + 1-2 tsp of mustard (dijon or grain) + ½ tsp of sweet (maple syrup/honey). Shake, taste, adjust, then add 4-8 tbsp olive oil, then shake, taste, adjust.

191 2018-01-18 23:36:22 Have you seriously looked in the mirror lately?  You’re looking more like Scrooge every day. Long nose, pointy chin and a heart full of coal! If your life ambition has been to eliminate services that help the common make you should be boiled in oil with a stake in your heart.

196 2018-01-18 23:35:19 I’m the same. But some how, I never manage to break the display.

It’s up there with the oil lasting a whole seven days, so far as miracles go.
197 2018-01-18 23:35:09 At least using the money on oil projects is useful. Let’s talk about all the wasted money on liberal projects that do absolutely nothing.
198 2018-01-18 23:35:00 Utter garbage. The free movement of EU workers (particularly Danish, Dutch and Polish) is vital to the sector of the oil industry I work in. You cleary have no knoweldge of the needs of the oil industry.

207 2018-01-18 23:33:56 er, I guess u still use a tiny bit of oil?
208 2018-01-18 23:33:56 that's the irony. Vegetable oil doesn't occur in those quantities naturally and the body is unable to digest it properly
209 2018-01-18 23:33:53 "So how does motor oil taste? My hands are clean but they smell of motor oil from working on my suit and motorcycle..."
210 2018-01-18 23:33:40 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
211 2018-01-18 23:33:39 I'm now wondering if it's possible to create something halfway between a randle, a hop rocket and a carbstone pump that introduces hop aroma oil into the beer as it's dispensed from the keg.
212 2018-01-18 23:33:34 My grandpa is a real one. Helped @weee_goo replace his headlights and was down to change his oil too 
213 2018-01-18 23:33:25 When this Good Samaritan poured in the wine that hurt, the oil that healed the pain, He did so because He loved us. Again He lifted us & made us His friends, & He calls us, as He called this robber, this thief hanging by His side, calls us to paradise even in our pain.
214 2018-01-18 23:33:04 It’s just not Oil projects. It’s everything.
215 2018-01-18 23:32:56 “Octane for the brain”. What does that even mean. Does Dave’s brain knock at high altitude or under heavy acceleration? Will this oil suppress detonation? Lol
216 2018-01-18 23:32:23 2018 grocery list is legit: brown bread, banana, grapes, lychee, pineapple, mango, lettuce, broccoli, aubergine, olive oil, lo salt, oregano, pepper, ginger, soy milk, cocoa powder, coffee, vegetable spread, sliced cheese, bran flakes,tortilla wraps and rice noodles. #change4life

219 2018-01-18 23:31:52 Our baby was like this a couple of weeks ago mate, not a cough all day, played and played all day, then as soon as he went to bed, he was coughing for hours. The only thing that worked for him was, boiling water in a bowl near his bed, with baby olbus oil dropped into it.
220 2018-01-18 23:31:49 sounds good. miss the oil or no?
221 2018-01-18 23:31:42 Definitely and they should be our Country’s first concern. Trump doesn’t seem to care about them but he sure cares about Russia & Big Oil. I don’t think the Sanctions have ever been implemented. IDK how he’s getting away with it b/c it’s Law passed by both House & Senate.

234 2018-01-18 23:29:38 tho sadly i only started moisturizing with oil recently
235 2018-01-18 23:29:09 As we fought for oil, we will fight for water.
236 2018-01-18 23:28:39 Y’all don’t understand how Bio Oil has changed my life.
237 2018-01-18 23:28:33 My mom @nancyhjenkins who is an olive oil expert often swaps the butter out and adds olive oil in dessert with truly delicious results even if initially people think it’s weird...
238 2018-01-18 23:28:22 Simple healthy recipe:
Sauté red pepper, onion, celery & garlic in 1tsp oil
Add rice and stock to rice cooker. Add more liquid than rice calls for
Add 2 chunked fish fillets
Add sautéed veg
Add big handful of greens
Cover and let the rice cooker do its thing.

Super delicious!
239 2018-01-18 23:28:19 It is against my spiritual and moral values to fund illegal wars and oil companies.  Can I stop paying the portion of my taxes that support these activities?
240 2018-01-18 23:27:12 Boom! Got my oil changed my oil filter changed and my air filter  they even put washer fluid in for me 
241 2018-01-18 23:27:07 Ive tried sugar and coconut oil but never with honey! I heard that exfoliating when dry could make it worse that’s why I haven’t done dat yet

The oil industry and
244 2018-01-18 23:26:31 No it's not... There is still enough oil in that car that can take you to work but don't forget to see ur mechanic after and fix the oil shortage once and for all.
245 2018-01-18 23:26:19 Hair drenched in coconut oil and smelling like a macaroon 
246 2018-01-18 23:26:16 2. The corporations get access to and profit from our natural resources while we get a fraction of the money as a royalty which more often then not goes back to the corporations as a handout. 
3. If resouces still belonged to us we would run mines and oil making billions too.
247 2018-01-18 23:26:02 More jobs.  Big companies building more.  More American production.  Oil exports are increasing.  Our reserves are shrinking causing a slight rise in BBL prices.  New equipment purchases to drill.  Higher wages.  Bigger tips to wait staff.    All these are bonuses!!!!
248 2018-01-18 23:25:56 3 spoons of warm oil to wash it down too plz
249 2018-01-18 23:25:53 Yes. Internal oil pump. Probably a good idea to blow it out while we've got the pan off anyway. Make sure there aren't any little surprises hidden away in there. Lol
250 2018-01-18 23:25:23 Yes that's what I love about olive oil
251 2018-01-18 23:25:22 Ours has nails and I just did this. BANG! BANG!... Neighbour leaned over the fence and asked what the hell I was doing :) I'm at the oil/paint part. Hot tip: wear a mask for the fumes, even though it's outdoors.

255 2018-01-18 23:24:52 I've been freebasing Murphy's Oil Soap...
256 2018-01-18 23:24:42 Don’t eat as many oils, don’t use sulfate shampoos or body washes, don’t put alcohol on your face, use mild face moisturizers, don’t use oil based foundation. That’s about all I know about
257 2018-01-18 23:24:29 Yeah! It’s really good, would definitely recommend it. Organic coconut oil helps too 
258 2018-01-18 23:24:27 Is it pizza flavored oil? Asking for a friend...

263 2018-01-18 23:23:55 Actually they are the unwitting imbeciles who bought snake oil from a con artist and are still lining up for more. Eventually they will see the light when the house of cards begins to crumble and they will be first to ask what happened?
264 2018-01-18 23:23:52 NO MORE OIL ON MY BODY, I AM FINALLY FREE
265 2018-01-18 23:23:52 CNN snake oil sales
266 2018-01-18 23:23:14 Either lemon juice + olive oil OR a spoon each of yogurt + mayo, splash of vinegar/citrus juice, S&P, dash of hot sauce/sriracha. Yay!
267 2018-01-18 23:23:14 When we were in Russia the RUSSIANS not Americans even told us that the reason the economy was healthy at all was because of the oil that was found, which had NOTHING to do with Putin.  Thus, he had NOTHING to do with any economic success Russian may have had.
268 2018-01-18 23:22:58 When i have braids it doesn’t matter how much i oil my scalp it always get back dry and itchy

271 2018-01-18 23:22:47 Because even CNN admits im right they covered the economic downturn coal oil company's crashed lol .
272 2018-01-18 23:22:44 Where are you getting these “alternate” facts. I do not believe you nor trust you. You are a modern day snake oil salesman.
273 2018-01-18 23:22:42 Caught the last episode - Check out the Zone Diet by Dr. Barry Sears; treat food as a drug & stay away from table sugar & no food high in sugar.  Your meals should be 2/3 of a plate w/Veggies,1/3 w/Protein 4to6 oz. and quality fat Olive Oil, coconut oil, & nuts.  No Soda or Juice
274 2018-01-18 23:22:32 He’s a snake oil salesman. Him and mcshay both...the era of the “draft expert” who’s never worked a minute in the field is a joke.
275 2018-01-18 23:22:30 Reaaalllllly finely mince a little onion, add a few Ts apple cider vinegar & let it stand 5-10 min. Then mix more vinegar & oil in a proportion you like. I add mustard and/or herbs sometimes.
276 2018-01-18 23:22:24 Olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard
277 2018-01-18 23:22:14 me: *reading about snake oil crazes of the 18th century* what idiots, don't they get there's no one thing that can solve all life's problems

also me: if I can find a digital trading card game with the right loot drop/crafting system I think I might finally be happy
278 2018-01-18 23:22:13 Brown was in charge of regulation for 10 years before it went pop!! Tough to blame Major for it.

Norway oil a good model. Privatisation we might differ on - central control normally is pants - see above - but selling off assets cheaply not sensible
279 2018-01-18 23:22:05 today’s self care

hair mask: egg, coconut oil, olive oil, honey. 

face mask: matcha powder, cinnamon powder, turmeric powder, honey.
280 2018-01-18 23:21:51 wait how even, oh well oil needs some spice in his life anyways
281 2018-01-18 23:21:50 For sure!!! It probably has an internal oil pump, right?? I would take that off and blow it out. Otherwise, you're good!!!
282 2018-01-18 23:21:49 CBD Oil?
283 2018-01-18 23:21:30 《オリーブ油豆知識》

284 2018-01-18 23:21:30 Nope, but I think GOP should now stand for the Gold and Oil Party (or Gold and Oil President)
285 2018-01-18 23:21:25 Kenney anointed Wall the "real leader of Western Canada" then Putin blew up his potash cartel and the bottom fell out of oil. 
Now he's just a guy slagging A&W, facing questions about a land scandal and criticizing the GG and academics.
286 2018-01-18 23:21:17 Working on a new lip scrub from what i already have around the house. What should I use as the carrier oil?

288 2018-01-18 23:20:49 Olive oil, a wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sometimes some lemon juice, pepper! Classic French flavors
289 2018-01-18 23:20:48 The coconut oil raises your cholesterol.
290 2018-01-18 23:20:42 That box be slippery like trying to walk on oil.
291 2018-01-18 23:20:36 Yeah, that 201,000 gallon oil spill on the Keystone was great for the country. The 672,000 gallons of oil in the Gulf of mexico? Perfection. Now they want to remove even more safety regulations enacted after the BP spill because they are “unnecessary burdens”.
292 2018-01-18 23:20:22 Also, for days I just don't feel like it I use the Penzey's country french vinaigrette mix that just requires olive oil and red wine vinegar.
293 2018-01-18 23:20:05 Olive oil, vinegar, sea salt, pepper
294 2018-01-18 23:19:44 3 spoons of warm oil is not that bad.  Maybe if it was cold.
295 2018-01-18 23:19:39 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
296 2018-01-18 23:19:23 JUST LIKE THE OIL COMPANYS ARE READY FOR AN OIL SPILL.??
297 2018-01-18 23:19:19 Are you saying best to just stop Norwegian. Oil experts coming in? I am confused? A separate immigration system would help. How many unionist pollies in N.I are getting Irish passports as immigration changes?
298 2018-01-18 23:19:18 Anybody got some tea tree oil for me
299 2018-01-18 23:19:12 Isn’t one difference is that Co resource is much more geographically concentrated than oil resource? And because Co collocates with Cu, we aren’t super likely to find many more new resources.

309 2018-01-18 23:17:43 I use a 3:1 oil to acid ratio (usually olive oil and whatever vinegar goes best, but lemon juice works too), add some salt and pepper and some Dijon for emulsion. You can add fresh garlic and herbs but then it doesn't last in fridge.
310 2018-01-18 23:17:38 I had to bust out My green gorilla oil.  
311 2018-01-18 23:17:25 Why nails?!? Indeed. Next step is a restoration job before I even get to the oil. Check back in 2019.

313 2018-01-18 23:17:04 Presumably an English Channel bridge would create an interesting engineering and/or diplomatic problem: It’d need to be big enough to have oil tankers and Suezmax ships pass under it, otherwise it upsets Rotterdam and Hamberg (not to mention Felixstowe and London Gateway) ports.

318 2018-01-18 23:16:00 Russia, Turkey, Britain, a little France and until recently the US. The Assad Regime was installed to serve the same purpose as Saddam on Iraq. To limit tribal warring and keep the oil flowing.
319 2018-01-18 23:15:35 (if you want rly close shaves condition for 2m, shave with grain, then against grain, then without washing off the residual conditioner use liquid soap for a last against grain pass if anything is left, it'll skate really close on a layer of surfactant'd oil)
320 2018-01-18 23:15:35 you can vary that endlessly -- add a dollop of mustard or a spoonful of chopped garlic or herbs, sub out some of the oil with tahini or peanut butter
321 2018-01-18 23:15:15 Listening to all these ICO pitches being given at The North American Bitcoin Conference is like trying to pick which flavor of snake oil I want to heal me.

323 2018-01-18 23:15:05 Olive oil, brown mustard, and honey. Whisk together and add some salt, pepper, and/or garlic to taste. Easy peasy!

346 2018-01-18 23:12:33 True, though Tories take some blame for that also with Major and Lamont et all. 

Selling the gold when he did wasn’t so smart. 

Oh, and Thatcher sold off state assets on the cheap to her friends as Cameron did with Royal Mail.

365 2018-01-18 23:10:32 In regards to corruption yes it’s very bad here. We have enough oil & minerals to rival that of the USA in being an economic powerhouse, but scores of politicians have stolen that wealth from the Mexican people.
366 2018-01-18 23:10:32 You've got to play their game, senator.

371 2018-01-18 23:09:43 Generally I use a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 oil:acid, plus stuff. EG: Olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Good acidic things: lemon juice, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar. Put them in a jar and shake like hell to emulsify.

373 2018-01-18 23:09:04 Where in the world did you hear that? Oily skin means you're dry and produce too much oil to overcompensate for dehydration.
Oil attracts oil, so you're actually moisturizing AND balancing your sebum production by using oils.
374 2018-01-18 23:09:01 We on the outside traditionally think of the crime terror nexus as oil and water separated, sitting neatly and distinct in the same glass. 

From the inside, the reality is more like water and cordial. Once mixed, they’re indistinguishable and should be explained symbiotically.
375 2018-01-18 23:09:00 Olive oil, (rice, balsamic, sherry) vinegar, Dijon (smooth or whole grain), honey, salt, pepper, lemon, and any of the following optional: garlic, thyme, basil, oregano, etc.

391 2018-01-18 23:07:33 I generally do a 2:1 ratio of good olive oil to vinegar or lemon juice (I like balsamic), add a smashed clove of garlic, a little bit of maple syrup or honey, salt, pepper, and fresh or dried thyme to taste. A bit of mustard for emulsification. Whisk or shake in a jar.

404 2018-01-18 23:05:52 Here's what I do almost every time I make a salad: squeeze lemon juice into a measuring cup, smash/chop anchovy with garlic & salt and add, whisk in olive oil to taste. Sometimes I add mustard, or use vinegar instead of lemon, or add shallot, or leave out the anchovy/garlic.

410 2018-01-18 23:05:16 This is for the same reason that a review of oil, coal, and natural gas #royalties is needed. It is about ethical considerations. Those natural resources are commonly owned by present and future generations of Albertans.

412 2018-01-18 23:05:10 I’m not sure that says what you think it says. 2015-2017 Alberta was hurting due to low oil prices. The 2nd pic says “strongest growth in the G7”. And it’ll likely top that.

417 2018-01-18 23:04:48 Doesn't this promotion of sustainable #palmoil simply weaken the case that palm oil -  and other substances that can cause even greater environmental havoc - be ultimately banned from all foods and other items? Need to consciously reconfigure everything towards this goal.

427 2018-01-18 23:03:27 Honorable @RepLujanGrisham our economy is in the dumps. Oil and gas profits are at all time lows which was this state's bread and butter. In my opinion I think it's time to go full blown recreational cannabis in our state. What say you Ms Grisham?

430 2018-01-18 23:03:03 I go olive oil, lemon juice, rice vinegar, S&P, coarse-ground mustard, possibly minced shallots or garlic. Fresh herbs like basil or cilantro if around. The mustard helps emulsify! and a tiny dab of mayo *really* gets the emulsification started.

436 2018-01-18 23:02:25 I find it interesting how quickly oil and gas executives put forward their Step Up Oklahoma plan to fund education and basic state services when it became apparent to them that a large majority of Oklahomans favor a state question to raise gross production tax to 7%.
437 2018-01-18 23:02:19 It helps my hair grow like crazy! My edges in the front were starting to thin a lil after my last weave and I remember this trick and they’ve already grown back. I also have been using a castor oil edge control too. And it keeps my moisture locked in better
438 2018-01-18 23:02:18 First of all I hope Oil companies immediately stop delivering FF to LA. No FF powered grid going to the county anymore. Then the court case is exactly what the world needs: scientific evidence in court to show which side is right. Can’t wait! Lefties will loose.

452 2018-01-18 23:00:37 The VS lotion my sister gave to me has mineral oil listed as it’s second concentrated ingredient behind water. This lotion was almost $20? Like why does a $20 lotion have mineral oil in it?

477 2018-01-18 22:57:40 What I find interesting is we own the oil and minerals but the state owns the water!?!?
478 2018-01-18 22:57:36 Norway's taxes are friendly to private business, and their government is funded largely by oil money. They avoided Venezuela's mistake of going full Chavez.
479 2018-01-18 22:57:15 @MillyMollyManda Hi Amanda Luisa Welch here. Did u get my invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo? would love it if you could come. Can I resend to a diff. email address? thank you

484 2018-01-18 22:56:52 No it works super well for oily skin as well! It helps regulate sebum production and prevents breakouts. I used to have really oily/acne prone skin and it even helped diminish acne scars when I combined it with tea tree oil
485 2018-01-18 22:56:38 Has anyone tried cannabis oil??
486 2018-01-18 22:56:25 It hasn’t for mine and my skin is combination. However, I use an oil for a moisturizer so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it :/

495 2018-01-18 22:55:02 @BP_plc remember that oil spill
496 2018-01-18 22:54:58 Yeah, I agree with Mayor deBlasio, make big oil companies pay!
497 2018-01-18 22:54:55 I’d be bloody complaining if my other half was rolling around in oil on the bedsheets 
498 2018-01-18 22:54:36 Any other money from Nike or oil?
499 2018-01-18 22:54:25 i think the worst we saw was incorrect oil drain plugs (bad!), and drain plug bolts that had been sheared off entirely, ignored, and new oil just put in directly on top without even draining the old oil.
500 2018-01-18 22:54:24 through the development of local content in oil and gas.
501 2018-01-18 22:53:28 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
502 2018-01-18 22:53:23 No, all of it is cooked in peanut oil!
503 2018-01-18 22:52:47 Have you tried Clove Oil? it's so weird, stings like anything but numbs the pain!
504 2018-01-18 22:52:42 Olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic salt, splash of water, basil/oregano/thyme. 

I believe in you, Margaret.
505 2018-01-18 22:52:24 @tvcnewsng #JH When crude Oil price was down, @MBuhari went appealing to #OPEC to cut production in order for price to increase. We know price will increase, we beg for it but we did not prepare for it. What a shame!
506 2018-01-18 22:52:22 Nothing like some new brakes and a fresh oil change  Watch Out Bitches

508 2018-01-18 22:52:06 life hack - mixing tea tree oil w ur moisturizer during the day, under your makeup, and at night. legit overnight it cleared most of my hair bumps and brightened my acne scars. i used cetaphil moisturizer. added three drops.
509 2018-01-18 22:51:46 In some ways I feel as though I've largely gotten over my anxieties (can walk to a coffee shop and not feel like my body is shutting down!) but then I called to schedule an oil change just now & felt like I was going into a panic attack. WHY!
510 2018-01-18 22:51:46 I've Been Using This Natural Coconut Oil For My Hair & The Results Are Good  Growing My Hair From Damages After 6 Months Of Using  #Natural
511 2018-01-18 22:51:44 As someone who worked in the oil industry for over 40 years and have lived and worked all over the world, you are speaking absolute and utter tripe! We work in the deserts of Libya or the jungles of the Far East and you think some imaginary unionist barrier will stop us? Grow up.
512 2018-01-18 22:51:39 "Now instead of having to drink all that gross oil to get my daily requirement, I know I could just eat delicious pizza instead!"
513 2018-01-18 22:51:38 I was fortunate enough to consider $1000 breadcrumbs -- then the resources, nat gas, and oil plunged, realestate plunged and Obama got elected.  $1000 now is A BIG DEAL. Peacock to feather duster almost overnight
514 2018-01-18 22:51:38 Dart shp block, forged crank, forged JE dome tops, forged rods, new intake, new front assembly stuff, new cam and lifters, new Moroso oil pan, bigger valves and machine work to existing heads, new rockers, crankcase evap that we didn't run before, it wasn't just a bottom end...

516 2018-01-18 22:51:33 Alberta growth due to higher deficit stimulus  spending  as well as recovering oil. Saskatchewan is also reliant on potash and uranium that has yet to recover
Your chart is useless without context
517 2018-01-18 22:51:25 my bad space limitation They approved it primarily for kids suffering uncontrollable seizures that were controlled w/cannabis oil (no thc) families were split up w/sick kid & 1 parent in CO, others just relocated for kids to get old...the DACA of drugs I guess

521 2018-01-18 22:50:11 Yeah but all that slack in the economy, with record high unemployment means Americans can be put to work, making produce and oil for Americans.

 If they need money for budget they must find the money/cuts.
 If need some additional votes GOP must make a proposal that is acceptable for those extra.
See GOP only tax reform... oil fields are tax?
525 2018-01-18 22:49:38 @DwightHoward, I'm eating broiled Steelhead trout over tri-color quinoa with coconut oil sauteed spinach...and homemade Japanese sweet potatoes fries with a side of kimichi

531 2018-01-18 22:48:46 would you like to also share your utensils or maybe chopping board as used for non-vegetarian preparations ... or even maybe use the same oil or even beef-broth for preparing your vegetarian curries ...  how far you want to go?

536 2018-01-18 22:48:19 Yikes! 
It’s the first big service, gear box oil and loads of other stuff.
537 2018-01-18 22:47:53 Trump officials weigh keeping national parks open even if government shuts down... to drill of oil, hunt wolves and bears and open coal mines?
538 2018-01-18 22:47:51 So our paycheck has increased.  So has the price of gasoline.  Trickle down wasn't meant for BIG OIL COMPANIES!! Oh just the Board of directors and share holders!! Thanks for nothing @realDonaldTrump

540 2018-01-18 22:47:32 Ok so in the past two weeks I've gotten my oil changed, new windshield wipers, got my radio installed, fixed my heat and glued back my side view mirror... I basically have a brand new car
541 2018-01-18 22:47:09 My go to is just 1 tbs olive oil, 1-1.5 tbs red wine vinegar (or any other) and a dab of Dijon mustard. Sometimes I add oregano or some herb like that.
542 2018-01-18 22:47:01 Haha - I’d be happy to be a Ola Norman - they have all the money, all the oil, and the most beautiful... mountains :)
543 2018-01-18 22:46:58 The regeneration  of Dundee is fantastic. Why is it that Aberdeen with its long time oil wealth looks tired and worn out. 

As an outsider, am I wrong in thinking objections are lodged against most plans to modernise Aberdeen?
544 2018-01-18 22:46:47 Under trump’s new stop Regulations coal miner deaths are up, 5 oil leaks 2 in the same place. Mass shooting by Whites are up. Shall I continue?
545 2018-01-18 22:46:43 i went from doing the oil change on my car to washing milton’s car wtf
546 2018-01-18 22:46:40 Aren't we forgetting how ppl like fernandinho Silva tevez ended up at city. Sit down bruv. City always have been and will be spoon fed the money made out of oil.
547 2018-01-18 22:46:39 I’m just preparing for the warmth. By the time you figure it out, all the carbon from the oil will already be in the air and the oil will be gone. Hopefully are planet will be lush with tropical rainforests moving north.
548 2018-01-18 22:46:37 Four seasons also make great little spice packets you just mix with balsamic vinegar, oil, and water, and they are my fave
549 2018-01-18 22:46:22 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
550 2018-01-18 22:46:12 It has been a massive oil spill spreading in the sea of East China, possibly the largest in decades. 
551 2018-01-18 22:46:01 RURALISTAS SIN UN CRITERIO.
Dolar a $ 35. o $ 40.- piden
Gas-oil a $ 32. piden
Viven en un país de ensueño, q bajen a tierra y vean que es imposible.
No tenemos petróleo, con el dolar a $ 37.-, lo pagaríamo casi un 28% más caro por lo q habría que asumentar el precio del gas oil.
552 2018-01-18 22:45:38 My favourite base is olive oil, vinegar, and to-your-taste parts of jam (I like raspberry!) and whole grain/Dijon mustard. It's fun to play around with!
553 2018-01-18 22:45:36 Also I'll usually just do a variation of 2 to 1 olive oil to whatever vinegar you like, with salt and black pepper to taste. Depending on the vinegar, might throw in a spoonful of mustard and/or honey.
554 2018-01-18 22:45:21 Score it, dry it and salt it. Don't put oil on it. Put under grill before resting if needed
555 2018-01-18 22:45:20 And culture, too. Longhorns, oil and guns!
556 2018-01-18 22:45:11 Yoy know why they're destroying Syria, right? Duhh... fucking Oil you idiots. Millions of Easterners are dying every year because of gas for your car.
557 2018-01-18 22:44:58 It's good baked with olive oil/salt sprinkled on top :3
558 2018-01-18 22:44:57 You know it’s a struggle when you have to squeeze oil from your chicken sandwich and rub it on your lip! #AshyLipSeasonHasArrived #StaySafe
559 2018-01-18 22:44:50 With her dark eyes, I've always thought Taylor Swift looks like she has been taken over by the black oil from The X Files
560 2018-01-18 22:44:36 This happened to me! Coconut oil helped a ton. And I dyed it back to my natural color and just kept trimming it and letting it grow out and I don’t put heat on it  your hair is much curlier than mine, but it helped me!
561 2018-01-18 22:44:27 My default=blob of Dijon mustard + smashed garlic clove + salt + pepper + dash lemon juice or vinegar, plus minced herbs if I’ve got em to an empty jar. Add 1/4 cup olive oil, screw on lid, shake vigorously.
562 2018-01-18 22:44:25 Juice some lemons, add an equal amount of olive oil, throw in salt/pepper/garlic powder, shake and serve. I eat this nearly every day.
563 2018-01-18 22:44:24 @elonmusk come SA daddy oil money is waiting

Olive teak stone root salad with herbal chive and ground berries.  Sweet naan san-gluten hearth Opal bread (wheat free) with extra virgin parsym oil and Dorothy ' Emerald Tea. A great finisher.
567 2018-01-18 22:44:12 why the oil gotta be warm tho what if i eat cold pizza should i swallow cold oil instead
568 2018-01-18 22:44:08 Because we know Trump is all about our national parks right? 10 of 12 national Park Board of Directors just quit because they can’t even get a meeting ? Trumps decimating our parks and would drill oil in them if he could
569 2018-01-18 22:44:07 You're right but there are so many flavors of Republican now that are like oil and water.
570 2018-01-18 22:44:00 Olive oil + vinegar + jam (apricot and raspberry work well) + lots of pepper. Also olive oil + Apple juice/cider + honey + mustard.
571 2018-01-18 22:43:58 What’s a good primer ? I usually just use a little bit of coconut oil
572 2018-01-18 22:43:35 Why didn’t I take up a career in oil & gas?

575 2018-01-18 22:43:25 Sensible store cupboard essentials is what I am working to. So far only rapeseed oil. But may use a spice or two in the long run
576 2018-01-18 22:43:20 キタキタ、エロ親父( ・∇・)
577 2018-01-18 22:43:19 I just went to the oil change place to get my tires filled up because it’s free. However I’ve been sitting here for 5 minutes.... I don’t think this is the best use of time/money.
578 2018-01-18 22:43:14 Check your Engine oil today.
579 2018-01-18 22:43:11 I have literally used every oil and lotion and my stomach is always so itchy
580 2018-01-18 22:43:10 Hopefully through @FullyChargedShw as I want to integrate a lot of eco efficient tech into the build in order to stop relying on heating oil and grid leccy. Want to investigate lighting, heating, insulation and even wind.
581 2018-01-18 22:43:06 it's actually only one spoonful of cold oil for some reason! (actually idk)
582 2018-01-18 22:43:03 U torn USSR! When?
Did Oil price plummeted due to ur control Or becoz u lost control? Still Gulf nations r recovering from it.
U must brace urself, once Venezuela & Russia start playing their game, u will be reduced to 1950s Chaotic Arabia under the control of Hajjaz.
583 2018-01-18 22:42:52 If so called sustainable #palmoil is the goal shouldn't all deforestation be stopped by promoting new plantations not where there is rainforest but in global regions where land is clearly not habitat? Is palm oil even a necessary ingredient or simply a convenient cheap one?
584 2018-01-18 22:42:30 I enjoy the coffee black most days, but some butter and coconut oil is just perfect as well
585 2018-01-18 22:42:28 Tax the remittance payments. They surpassed Mexico's 2016 national oil exports.
586 2018-01-18 22:42:13 I did that and suddenly my past life as the frisky daughter of a renaissance Italian olive oil baron came back to me! #duchesspompeian
587 2018-01-18 22:42:11 Dijon mustard, honey, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, S&P. Shallot if you have one but who just has one?
588 2018-01-18 22:41:45 Yes, especially if it's the area of your house where you hang out the most (where she plays) it's definitely worth it. We use about 500$ of wood for the entire winter, what you use in one month of heat (we also pay for oil and baseboards, but you get the idea, haha.)
589 2018-01-18 22:41:41 The press loved Obama, he was such a smooth talking snake oil salesman that did nothing for the US but man he was such a wonderful speaker while he corrupted our entire govt.

Trump is rough, honest and does what he said he would do. They'd rather have the liars.
590 2018-01-18 22:41:37 I like olive oil, lemon juice, salt, fine-chopped scallions. Let it soak for a while to get the flavor out of the scallions. Taste to see if it needs a little sugar. Simple but tasty.
591 2018-01-18 22:41:36 Thank you Stephen. It's been really tough on me. As you know I'm not feeling very good either. I had to buy heating oil instead of the 7 boxes of 6 per box flea treatment. I'm "Vet Poor".
592 2018-01-18 22:41:08 kinz: low oil *points at dash on my car*
me (pretending its fine): yep

595 2018-01-18 22:40:46 @jakequery we paid Irsay to break RCA Dome lease so the state could build him Lucas Oil
596 2018-01-18 22:40:39 for oil exploration.
597 2018-01-18 22:40:36 1 part sherry vinegar, 2 parts olive oil, pepper to taste. I make it every week.

603 2018-01-18 22:39:55 take some warm bread put olive oil salt amd oregano on it THATS THE BEST THING
604 2018-01-18 22:39:54 2014 wasn't "usual investment".  It was record high investment.  2014 started the year with oil over $100/barrel.  The current oil recovery is a spike on political worries.  Not going back to $100/barrel anytime soon and thus capital investment isn't going back to where it was.
605 2018-01-18 22:39:40 Go to swap meets and estate sales and buy oil paintings and original prints. Same price and much, much more interesting.
606 2018-01-18 22:39:15 olive oil sweetie i'm so sorry 
607 2018-01-18 22:39:15 During Cultural Revolution, oil and gas was only industry left alone. Produced enough for exports to Japan.
608 2018-01-18 22:39:14 What about oregano oil?  That stuff is awful but supposed to boost immunity.  Does anyone use??
609 2018-01-18 22:39:10 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
610 2018-01-18 22:38:46 let me warm up my oil

614 2018-01-18 22:37:46 Margaret! I haven't bought salad dressing in years. My go to is lime juice + olive oil + salt & pepper. Goes great with anything salad that includes goat cheese.
615 2018-01-18 22:37:45 no but really WHAT ITS NOT LIKE U DRINK OLIVE OIL HOW IS IT GROSS
616 2018-01-18 22:37:39 may nangyare ba sa hot oil treatment na pinagawa ko? huhu  parang sayang yung 200 tuloyyyy sabi ko kasi hairrelax nalang e wala naman color hair ko tsssk
617 2018-01-18 22:37:23 Term/Age Limits 4 All Elected & Appointed Federal Employees only answer 2 'Do Nothing' Politicians, Liberals like oil Republicans like Watet
618 2018-01-18 22:37:14 Dooooo ittttt  oil paints are one of the most beautiful mediums out there ~
619 2018-01-18 22:37:14 Yikes, 6 drops of straight oregano oil would burn like hell.
620 2018-01-18 22:37:13 The power steering column has a leak in it that would cost quite a bit to fix, so I just keep putting fluid in. It drinks a fair amount of oil.
621 2018-01-18 22:37:03 Reasons to date me:
- I have a very cute dog
- I’m kind of funny
- I always have enough oil to keep you as high as you want
- I have a kind heart
- I like to party
- If I don’t make you laugh by my jokes I’m pretty ugly so you can laugh at my looks
- Also I have a pretty rad mom
622 2018-01-18 22:37:00 Big oil will probably just turn around and raise prices and the consumer will end up paying for it all.
623 2018-01-18 22:36:57 That’s a good question! It has a very subtle nutty scent, nearly non existent though. I’m very sensitive to smells & I found this oil to be the least smelly out of many many more that I’ve tested.
624 2018-01-18 22:36:40 Need to get an audiologist on the case. I recommend Olive oil to soften hard wax.
625 2018-01-18 22:36:33 On behalf of men everywhere, we demand an oil set!!!
626 2018-01-18 22:36:29 Coincidentally, I already knew about the oregano oil tip. Bet that's why Shirley is so sprightly.
627 2018-01-18 22:36:24 $CL_F bounced after doing 3 swings lower. If it breaks 63.31 low, should see 62.76 - 62.39 area and find buyers again #Elliottwave #Oil
628 2018-01-18 22:36:18 “GIVE. MY DAUGHTER. THE OREGANO OIL. NOW!!!!!!”
629 2018-01-18 22:36:01 they're gonna take the oil money and they betray them when the time is right its such a genius plan
630 2018-01-18 22:35:59 Okay I do not have any oil on them I will make ice in the sea
631 2018-01-18 22:35:45 Olive oil soap ends up a slimy mess in my experience. Probably good if you have dry skin and don't mind slime.
632 2018-01-18 22:35:40 every $50 oil change I've gotten has cost me $215
633 2018-01-18 22:35:32 went to get an oil change and the mechanic said he couldnt do it because i have $2000 worth of damage under my hood involving my engine leaking and my water tank being rotted away by antifreeze lmao i love being an adult!! 
634 2018-01-18 22:35:28 olive oil is gross
635 2018-01-18 22:35:21 バイトが減るなら許した
636 2018-01-18 22:35:17 first of all, y’all need to stop being so picky about the type of jobs. nothing wrong with starting at walmart when you’re 16. not everyone is gonna get a desk job, someone has to change oil in cars, make burgers, and build houses. like come in peeps
637 2018-01-18 22:35:08 RT @LivingSafely: Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip this January? Its top four ingredients are whey, milk, canola oil and maltodextrin.
638 2018-01-18 22:34:59 italians prefer olive oil 
639 2018-01-18 22:34:59 oregano oil is really tough shit. How often did she recommend?
640 2018-01-18 22:34:53 Why can't  we have more wind and/or wave turbines to provide energy out in places along our pacific coast? We don't need more dirty oil rigs.
641 2018-01-18 22:34:46 @OMOTG Hi, luisa here.Sent invite by email to Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo in Westminster. Now following up via twitter. Can you make it? Can resend details. pls let me know. tx @luisawelch
642 2018-01-18 22:34:45 Since the last big two were basically GE/JP Morgan/Standard Oil wars, this is very convincing.
643 2018-01-18 22:34:27 I am so pleased I don't own one ounce of @Loreal products and now I will make sure I never do.
644 2018-01-18 22:34:17 EZ shares +0.2%, US shares -0.2% with shutdown risk looming. US 10 yr yld +4bp to 2.63%. Oil -0.4% to $63.7. Iron ore +0.8% to $73.3. ASX futures +0.3%. $A 0.80
645 2018-01-18 22:34:08 and yet you bought the snake oil & are OKwuth one rule for him& another for everyone else... it’s called wearing blinkers & hypocrisy
646 2018-01-18 22:34:02 When you're driving cross country and your car says "no oil stop engine" so you freak the fuck out, then you look to see what the closest shop is, and it's an hour and a half away and you pray that you make it. Which I did. Thanks #Walmart
647 2018-01-18 22:33:55 I miss them! Do you remember them being pretty olive oil-y? I might try swapping in oil for butter in one of the Olive Garden recipes I found to see if they'll be close to what I remember
648 2018-01-18 22:33:52 I just wrapped a movie with Anna Kendrick, Bill Hader, 1 of my childhood obsessions Julie Hagerty & the legendary Shirley MacLaine, who would like you all to know u should put 6 drops of oregano oil under your tongue to protect against illness. #TermsofEndearment #TrySomeOregano
649 2018-01-18 22:33:44 At this point i just use ACV & coconut oil though and it works wonders.
650 2018-01-18 22:33:41 @theresa_may @veganbottle oneplanet one solution . no oil inside our bottle #climat #OnePlanetSummit #plasticpollution
651 2018-01-18 22:33:40 I just used olive oil to clean out my ears and now I can hear like a bat and dress my salad.
652 2018-01-18 22:33:40 I can’t take all this winning.
We will have so much oil.
653 2018-01-18 22:33:33 “Hey Amazon, run away. We all smell like beard oil.”
654 2018-01-18 22:33:30 I took that oil painting class I’d been meaning to since my 20s
655 2018-01-18 22:33:07 @PAXvapor Hello! Do you have a list available of the dispensaries that carry your Era oil cartridges? Thanks!
656 2018-01-18 22:33:05 Peppermint oil on your temples and base of your neck and a super hot shower works for me personally
657 2018-01-18 22:32:59 Gaah! Kosco shows up again but with fuel oil, that they finally filled yesterday. Propane has been empty for days.
658 2018-01-18 22:32:56 Again, I'm in agreement.. and it could be argued whether those wars were fought for oil or not (they probably were)..
659 2018-01-18 22:32:54 @blenderbasil Hi, Luisa here. Sent you invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo but have not heard. Following up via twitter. Can you make it? pls let me know. thank you, luisa
660 2018-01-18 22:32:49 A lit cigarette in an oil refinery.
661 2018-01-18 22:32:42 "Thank you #Venezuela, we think we're coming out of this," jokingly says Robert McNally from Rapidan Energy Group at Argus Crude Summit in Houston, referring to Venezuela's contribution to higher  oil prices #OOTT
662 2018-01-18 22:32:38 #ILuvEUCos it didn't bareface lie to me in order to illegally invade a country in order to grab oil.
663 2018-01-18 22:32:36 Pat Kelsey is a snake oil salesmen he lies and runs ask UMass
664 2018-01-18 22:32:13 I ordered the grape seed oil off of amazon and the essential oil is from young living but you can probably get both from a grocery/ organic grocery store!!
665 2018-01-18 22:32:06 #Flower Fact: Pure essential Rose Oil has a measured frequency of 320 Mhz. Far higher than any other essential oil.
666 2018-01-18 22:31:53 omg that’s the only reason I got it too! lmaooo I used it for a week and my whole forehead broke out  jojoba oil and hyaluronic acid have been my saving grace.
667 2018-01-18 22:31:41 I have to say, if I never have to use an oil pastel again in my life I will be grateful

I am an acrylic kind of girl in the end after all
668 2018-01-18 22:31:23 I love it with oil & balsamic .. yummy ying & yang 
669 2018-01-18 22:31:23 This is gonna make me sound so old, but.......... why the FUCK is avocado oil THREE TIMES more expensive than olive oil?!?!
670 2018-01-18 22:31:23 My car doesn’t tell me when it needs an oil change
671 2018-01-18 22:31:22 Oh no, he included Midnight Oil *and* Goanna's Solid Rock. The more i think about it the more im convinced its a shameless trolling effort
672 2018-01-18 22:31:14 Again...how many soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines lives are traded for the risk of not drilling our own oil? Thanks, but I'll take the lives over the risk any day.
673 2018-01-18 22:31:10 I wouldn’t say that. Kiper has a job that a trained ape with greased up hair could do.  He is a snake oil salesman with a terrible track record and the big E keeps trotting him out like the last years with Dick Clark.  It’s sad
674 2018-01-18 22:31:06 Why the heck is Avocado oil $13 compared to vegetable oil $3; I swear y’all really showing more and more y’all don’t want us to be healthy 
675 2018-01-18 22:31:04 Touch ME  NIGGAS SLIDIN LIKE THEY RUNNIN ON OIL 
676 2018-01-18 22:30:55 I've heard coconut oil is good for the scalp.  What's your diet like/do you drink/exercise?
677 2018-01-18 22:30:46 Stir together 9 tsps kingfish with 2 1/2 pints dandelion greens. Add Olive Oil. Drain. Serve on a bed of pasta
678 2018-01-18 22:30:39 It goes down hill all the time when it has ‘than any other president in history.’ That’s when you know it’s snake oil.
679 2018-01-18 22:30:38 Jojoba oil welcome to my life
680 2018-01-18 22:30:24 Yes simply because #mufc money is generated through Success and not oil riches!
681 2018-01-18 22:30:22 Literally the only place I can get fresh ground peanut butter. I didn't know it would be so hard now to find it without sugar, oil, and anything that isn't peanuts.
682 2018-01-18 22:30:18 She would move her hands up and move Fishbones jaw. Nodding as it squeaked.

"He says he only uses the natural oil his body produces. He doesn't want any of that man made garbage"
683 2018-01-18 22:30:14 Yet another sign of the failure of our education system and a lack of scientific knowledge by the masses. WTF?!  What’s next?  Motor oil?
684 2018-01-18 22:30:11 I wish there was a course in #Inverness for women on how to do basic car maintenance things like changing oil, tyres... I am so rubbish and I want to learn 
685 2018-01-18 22:30:11 Bring on the oil.
686 2018-01-18 22:30:10 theory: the big oil companies paid the big car manufacturers to make their electric vehicles as ugly as possible so nobody buys them

692 2018-01-18 22:28:54 My first car was a 59 belair. Got from a friend for $20. He could not make it run. It had a 6 in it with a lot of miles. There was no adjustment left for the valves. Rocker shaft was so worn it looked like a camshaft. Put in junkyard shaft added oil lines and 60k miles later sold

695 2018-01-18 22:28:31 And our governments mis use of military troops is honorable ?  Profits to Haliburton?  Bush family. Chaney family. 911 Bush and all his oil company's funded by Binladen

699 2018-01-18 22:27:48 Is it extra-virgin Italian olive oil? Is there fresh focaccia nearby?  A sprinkling of sea salt? 
700 2018-01-18 22:27:43 Jeez you'd think that canola oil might work better and even serve as a good tanning oil for afterwards

706 2018-01-18 22:27:22 We need new armor instead of ornaments. Like come on. The new raid ornament looks worse than the actual gear. It just makes the gear look matte grey instead of shiny with oil. Can we really just work towards dropping the token system and bringing back bounties? Tokens suck.

713 2018-01-18 22:26:23 Or you can chop it up and put on a sheet tray with oil, salt, pepper and roast. Then add garlic, rosemary and pine nuts and finish for a min
714 2018-01-18 22:25:52 Norway claims its up to the users, not the producers to fix their addiction. I think they have a point. I don't blame Shell Rotterdam for oil refineries either. And better from Norway then some other countries.
715 2018-01-18 22:25:51 Bed time, time to test out a sample of an oil thats meant to help you get a better sleep, heres hoping!
716 2018-01-18 22:25:41 We are the controllers in the oil market We have torn the Soviet Union a part ,we buy consciences, BTW don't try to F*** someone by a d***  not belong to you ;)

718 2018-01-18 22:25:37 bruh! me too. way too much oil in it
719 2018-01-18 22:25:21 Lol them 100 dollar oil changes make you even cheaper I like to say I’m cheaper than the dad from everybody hates chris
720 2018-01-18 22:25:02 Okay yea that's where I used to go for my old car. This may be a stupid question but can they change my oil even if I drive a Honda?
721 2018-01-18 22:24:52 We had lads from Scotland working in Iraq oilfields just after the Iraqi war. We work all over the world and it's you and your Little Britain attitude that threatens that. P.S you obviously know bugger all about the oil industry if you think Aberdeen is the centre of it.
722 2018-01-18 22:24:45 in the AM. At night I use avocado oil to get makeup off + alba acnedote face wash + acnedote astringent or deciem's glycolic toner + deciem 2% retinoid + Sunday riley u.f.o oil (A LIFE CHANGER) + pacifica super flower rapid response face oil (i swear this stuff is magic)
723 2018-01-18 22:24:41 My anger is he’s going to damage lives. Whether true evangelism or knowing snake oil, I’d be angry. These are poor methods with hazardous publicity. And at the end of it, either way, he gets a nice cheque.
724 2018-01-18 22:24:38 MCFC IS OIL MONEY. BUILT NOT BOUGHT
725 2018-01-18 22:24:34 I have hemp oil at the brib. Good looks bri.
726 2018-01-18 22:24:23 A flat tax is why Alberta didn't have any rain day money when oil prices dropped.
727 2018-01-18 22:24:06 Mud scrapers heaven
728 2018-01-18 22:23:42 Currently used my last $17 on gas. I have no windshield fluid i need an oil change my tires need air..and im currently craving tacos
729 2018-01-18 22:23:27 There is Western democracy, Oil & Sheiks democracy, Russian democracy & Chinese communism. Africa is like a damaged car in intensive panel beating Garage. Time we come up with our own type of democracy that suits Africans
730 2018-01-18 22:23:15 Come by for our art reception for John Kosta, Story in Oil on Saturday Feb 3rd from 6-9pm in Claremont Village. #artwalk #claremontartwalk #JohnKosta #SquareiGallery
731 2018-01-18 22:23:11 I have ingested 9 spoons of oil today according to that. No regrets.
732 2018-01-18 22:23:10 This will not play as well for Dems this time... Trump is a new type of adversary. Get ready for shock and awe...
733 2018-01-18 22:23:06 I can’t wait for #Mueller to share the quid pro quo with Russia for stealing the election. Ease sanctions so they can set up nuclear energy in Saudi Arabi, and tap into Russia’s oil stash to make a select few billions. Go ahead... tell me it’s a hoax.
734 2018-01-18 22:22:59 Just oiling is yeah, oil won’t make hair grow...you gotta shave the faint hairs over and over till they grow strong
735 2018-01-18 22:22:47 I hate taking this drive to Greenwood just for my car but I refuse to pay for oil changes.
736 2018-01-18 22:22:41 I just want my hair oil 
737 2018-01-18 22:22:24 I'm actually thinking of trying 3 spoons of warm oil now!
738 2018-01-18 22:22:19 I think this Amazon rep knows I’m not mature enough to demand restitution when he calls EVOO “virgin oil.” 
739 2018-01-18 22:22:18 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer Would love to get your thoughts re: AMLP. With cold weather blasts in US, bump in oil and tax changes, will AMLP benefit? Is it a buy?
740 2018-01-18 22:22:17 Oil money, I'm sure.
741 2018-01-18 22:22:14 Walmart dead ass take 2 hours for a damn oil change  should’ve went to good year
742 2018-01-18 22:22:11 great.. it seems we agree? 
can i go back to telling this guy he sucks for defending this snake oil salesman?
743 2018-01-18 22:21:59 Doug Dimmadome - owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome is most certainly an oil tycoon and it only took me like 10 years to figure that out.
744 2018-01-18 22:21:52 You need pussy that's why oil in your back got you tripping
745 2018-01-18 22:21:31 But we have endless amounts of cheeper oil and gas.  You remember you are from Calgary right?  You need to spend some time with oil and gas workers.
746 2018-01-18 22:21:25 Maybe one of these days someone will highlight  term "nonessential," and ask why.
747 2018-01-18 22:21:24 It smells like someone at my apartment building is making sesame oil chicken (麻油雞) and I would very much like to be invited over for dinner.
748 2018-01-18 22:21:24 You're going to have to evidence that. How do you think all the other small countries manage and the don't have oil,gas,renewables,whisky,gin,salmon,abundance of water,fish Etc Etc? 
749 2018-01-18 22:21:10 However I'm unsure if the head of Shell or BP would be going on rig to be a roustabout just to keep up with what's going on at the oil face
750 2018-01-18 22:20:58 No complaints about the dealership. I was coming in for an oil change and had an issue on the way in. They quickly diagnosed and offered to fix while I waited and I had my laptop so I said ok. The no food part was my fault. Will have a huge dinner!
751 2018-01-18 22:20:56 I usually go to Nissan of Athens, they always has a $20 and they do ladies oil changes for like $10 on certain days
752 2018-01-18 22:20:53 Eucalyptus oil is a favorite of mine! I love the earthy smell that it has! #corkedinc #corked #portablearomatherapy #diffusers
753 2018-01-18 22:20:52 Rick Simpson oil.  Maybe some aloe water?
754 2018-01-18 22:20:48 This @MrAyeDee guy is Insane, His idol virtually shut down upstream operations in the Delta to prospect for oil in Northeast and people lost their jobs by that act and asshole is here talking jazz, he is not aware of any industry but politics cause that’s where he steals from.
755 2018-01-18 22:20:24 @BBCNews Just seen your feature on CO2 emissions and temperature rises. What is the biggest cause of greenhouse gases; Oil? Coal? Cars? Aeroplanes? Boats? Nope... The biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions is animal farming  Not one mention in your report?? Shocking!
756 2018-01-18 22:20:23 I think eating good foods and taking supplements like Oil of Oregano and practicing good hygiene all help prevent the Flu @momsandmunchkin #ShoppersFlu

758 2018-01-18 22:20:06 We have used this for years in the oil and gas industry's for manpower services so it is not new
759 2018-01-18 22:20:04 So what "oil money" do you mean?, exactly?

762 2018-01-18 22:19:56 Putting baby oil on your skin right after the shower seals the moisture in and keeps you moisturized all day today.
763 2018-01-18 22:19:53 The sun will evaporate the oil, & the other ball sports.
764 2018-01-18 22:19:46 the dogmobile needs a bath & an oil change & brakes 
765 2018-01-18 22:19:44 a lot of my research is coming down to using dr bronners, thayer’s rose petal toner, rosewater spray somewhere in there and oil as a moisturizer i find that if i wash my face everyday my face dries out also.
766 2018-01-18 22:19:31 uhhh i did both a coconut oil treatment AND used a hair mask and my hair does not feel any better. tf is this.
767 2018-01-18 22:19:19 "You sure you don't want to get oil massage? I'll wear my battle apron outfit heh."

Or nothing at all was what she meant, as her hands began to slide along her lover's shoulders slowly.

771 2018-01-18 22:19:07 I work with Poles, Irish,Turks, French & Spanish plus Kiwis, Boks & Americans in one oil project! I’ve worked in oil in Germany, Norway & Denmark. How will stopping freedom of movement benefit Aberdeen’s major industry? That flexibility is essential.
772 2018-01-18 22:18:46 That’s the thing. It’s not just the oil slick when it hasn’t been washed, it’s how weird it sits when it has. Mine’s dry and kinky and basically a nightmare one day, oil slick the next

774 2018-01-18 22:18:39 Given your constituency, you should be able to find some oil and gas workers. Probably a good idea to ask them for a conversation regarding their experiences before taking a stand. (Hint; it's a global industry.)
775 2018-01-18 22:18:38 You mean the same mayor who stopped Canadian oil from reaching the east coast and allows raw sewage to flow into the St. Lawrence?
776 2018-01-18 22:18:30 
777 2018-01-18 22:18:01 We r buyers of oil from ur region. Otherwise, USA shale technique is good for oil which crashed ur market.
India is gracious enough to still buy oil from Middle East.
778 2018-01-18 22:17:34 If you add oil when making white rice. Come on. It’s 2018
779 2018-01-18 22:17:27 Personally, the oil bit is far more appealing to me.... Can I interest you in some cauliflower pizza drenched in grease? It's quite yummy!
780 2018-01-18 22:17:27 Did you use clove oil?
781 2018-01-18 22:17:25 Nah Pep's bluff was called. Petroleum dollars doth not a club make. City is the arriviste tinsel town crude oil facelift of a club. Sanchez saw through the fake gold of Pep's paradise shitty and the fact Pep only wanted injury cover. Clever boy.
782 2018-01-18 22:17:21 Almost nothing compares to the panic you get when the oil starts popping as you’re cooking

789 2018-01-18 22:16:18 Thank you for that very kind compliment. I actually used Oil of Olay from age 19 until I was past 45, so maybe you aren’t quite far off! Now it’s just Burt’s Bees Intense hydrating moisturizer & a few drops of Vitamin E oil every day
790 2018-01-18 22:16:18 Allahumma Amin ya Allaah
791 2018-01-18 22:16:07 you would describe Oil money as self generated money?!..
792 2018-01-18 22:15:52 Well, I guess no more @LOrealUSA for me. Seriously....if this is the type of person you want as a spokes person, I'm out. The world has enough hate without you promoting someone who thrives off it

794 2018-01-18 22:15:32 Thank you! I took my anointing oil that my daughter brought me back from Israel to the Crabb concert and had Pastor Aaron pray for me. Prayers were answered!  Love you! 
795 2018-01-18 22:15:32 It is just because there is no actual cream in it. It is just flavored oil. And oil can last a super long time.
796 2018-01-18 22:15:31 Congress like a big machine, thirsty for oil to grease the cogs in order to make it run smoothly. Ear marks are a means to an end used to spread a little grease around and oil the machine to make it work.
797 2018-01-18 22:15:19 @CarolineHirons Please could you kindly recommend a night facial oil for combination skin. Thanking you in advance xxx
798 2018-01-18 22:15:15 Big oil will be obsolete in 50 yrs. Why don't they start transitioning if for anything to preserve jobs. They could use their capital to leverage transition and job training.
799 2018-01-18 22:15:14 Allrecipes app. Personally I love any kind of pasta. Salmon and rice is easy, I cook it on the stove top with a little olive oil and lemon slices.

806 2018-01-18 22:13:32 "Now let us enjoy herring and the wealth of oil from the North Sea."
807 2018-01-18 22:13:27 The NHS doesn't work for exactly the same reason that people are starving in Venezuela despite it having the world's largest oil reserves. Socialist systems don't work.

810 2018-01-18 22:13:11 And it was not until Thatchers union reforms, credit deregulation, and privatisation drive, boosted by revenues from North Sea oil. That we started a recovery around 1985.

12 years AFTER joining the EEC.

The EEC as I recall suffered from Milk & Wine Lakes and Butter mountains.

815 2018-01-18 22:12:49 I'm more than slightly concerned with Trump's move to privatize the National Parks in order to extract oil and gas from those areas. Don't touch my parks. Don't touch the dirt. Don't touch the trees for lumber. You can fix the roads. But otherwise, no.
816 2018-01-18 22:12:08 Is rubber and plastic from the ground?
Can't they bring the infrastructure to bring it from the ground?

Shell oil is Exploring crude oil from under the ground,where did dey get infrastructure?

819 2018-01-18 22:11:16 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, one of Trump's judicial nominees began drilling for oil in the Constitution. A disaster!
820 2018-01-18 22:10:58 Some seriously bitter lemons on here tonight, you're trying to tell me if your club was approached by an oil tycoon or royal family or anything of that magnitude and wealth you'd say no thanks...course you would mate. After all you've got that sacred history to protect right 
821 2018-01-18 22:10:54 The one we know about is officially Ukrainian, but he is tied directly to Putin via Rosneft which is Russia's state-owned oil giant... Trump is connected to Rosneft too. Tangled web.
822 2018-01-18 22:10:48 Just got my oil changed finally and my car washed

830 2018-01-18 22:10:02 Trump’s mentality- expand offshore drilling but end tax from BIG OIL that went to cleanup costs, deregulate safety and let’s all hope nothing happens. Oh and exempt Florida
831 2018-01-18 22:09:34 If olive oil is made from olives, what is baby oil made out of?  #ThursdayThoughts
832 2018-01-18 22:09:34 I don’t know about Lebanese cuisine, but what is described in the link is EXACTLY what we call alioli or ajoaceite in Spain, except we would use olive oil. And it does go with everything.
833 2018-01-18 22:09:19 That 10 minute long dance remix of Power and the Passion Midnight Oil played the 1998 tour was weird wasn't it?
834 2018-01-18 22:09:07 It's so weird honestly  Could just be that the protein oil legit separates and you gotta mix it everytime but it was odd imo

839 2018-01-18 22:08:31 My USDCAD trade did not turn out the way I expected it. It maybe waiting on oil to go one way or another. Time will tell.

866 2018-01-18 22:05:01 Hmm, maybe an avocado oil based mix. That or just embrace the whole look and use actual avocados as a beard conditioner. Ewww... and delicious. 
867 2018-01-18 22:04:57 I tried to be cool and handle car stuff without my dad today. I ended up having to call my dad three times, went to two different shops, wasted more oil and gas only to have my dad take care of it. Again. I’m weak.

874 2018-01-18 22:03:50 You ignore agriculture, industry, oil, mining and the people who work in these capitalists industries. Socialist blinders on economics as usual.

876 2018-01-18 22:03:34 Oil is a natural substance that comes out of the earth oil spill was an over reaction. We need to drill. Climate change is a natural occurring phenomenon.
877 2018-01-18 22:03:22 Dull and flawed analysis bro... we lost jobs in banks, oil, manufacturing, agriculture and virtually all sectors of the economy so your postulating doesn't carry weight or sense..
878 2018-01-18 22:03:13 I think the oil fumes have got to you mate

885 2018-01-18 22:02:00 What?????? Do you know how many billions of dollars were made from Iraq??? The market went up, oil went up. Most wars in modern times are a result of market factors. Are you kidding?
886 2018-01-18 22:01:56 But Syria was created out of the ottoman Empire being cut up into tiny pieces. Tribes that had no connection were group together in artificial borders. The Assad family was installed by Britain for the easy flow of oil. I just don't see the point of backing a puppet state.

905 2018-01-18 22:00:07 Remember politicians were blaming the speculators for falling Oil prices and falling stock prices. Don't hear any credit being given now to those speculators.
906 2018-01-18 21:59:58 Why are they offering me fish oil?

908 2018-01-18 21:59:46 Ooh we think Rosy Cheeks would be a great fit, sweets! A simple blend of kaolin, calamine and Turkish rose oil to delicately calm the skin and restore balance, it was formulated to soothe even the most sensitive skin. 
909 2018-01-18 21:59:23 I love Oil of Olay. I started using the Total Effects and really like it. Neutrogena is also very good.
910 2018-01-18 21:59:13 I got a side salad instead of fries cause like I'm trying to be a better person. I expected it to be just plain lettuce w/ oil but THEY FINNESED THIS SHIT sunflower seeds and goat chz yasss thank u farm2fork capital!! I'm here for this
911 2018-01-18 21:59:10 Put olive oil in them! Remember how bad mine got xx
912 2018-01-18 21:59:06 Policy accomplishments? They jammed in the tax bill before the end of the year just to say he did somethingThey didn’t care who it hurts, just to line their pockets.Even with the majority they couldn’t do healthcare or anything else. They deserve/votedfor this snake oil salesman.
913 2018-01-18 21:59:05 Beard oil won’t look after your beard / make it grow better
914 2018-01-18 21:58:51 I say they oil up and have some Greco Roman Wrestling
915 2018-01-18 21:58:46 But yeah, apparently it has onions, orange bell peppers, scotch bonnets, lime juice, ginger root, garlic, olive oil, "salt and spices"

Seems more than "just hot" which is what I love
916 2018-01-18 21:58:45 Uncomfortability and growth are like oil and water. They don’t go together. So when your uncomfortable and you can’t stand the place you are. God is trying to pull back purpose.

918 2018-01-18 21:58:32 Who remembers Spaghetti Freddy’s? I used to go to the Norwood location; looks like it was in Northampton too. Trying to remember the breadsticks — what made them different than Olive Garden’s? Similar, but there was an extra seasoning. And maybe olive oil instead of butter?

920 2018-01-18 21:58:28 We know the Republicans are sociopaths.

But too often, we elected Democrats who enact the same policies like privatizing public ed, trade deals, & wars that only benefit oil companies, the military-industrial complex, and banks.

If Democrats did their jobs there would be no GOP
921 2018-01-18 21:58:20 For Bill make it special with olive oil

923 2018-01-18 21:58:16 Before that - A little olive oil , some onions, ginger n garlic paste and a pinch of heeng ...
924 2018-01-18 21:58:06 I'm gonna go ahead and guess that Robert Redford didn't need to cajole or put the hard sell on a single woman in his life.
925 2018-01-18 21:57:54 Black cumin seed oil cures diabetes... and you have to stop eating meat and start eating more vegetables. Meat causes so many health issues.
926 2018-01-18 21:57:48 Will this turn out to be a land grab for oil companies to load up on privates and sit on public permits until they have taken all the private lands?
927 2018-01-18 21:57:48 Our embargo of oil and scrap iron sales to Japan were in response to Japan's invasion of Manchuria and China, including the Rape of Nanking. You seem to have conveniently overlooked that fact.
928 2018-01-18 21:57:40 saw on Pinterest that olive oil will help your lashes grow.... now I can’t see and my face smells like Bravo

933 2018-01-18 21:57:01 So what would you have to say if it was an oil company rep sitting on an environmental board?
934 2018-01-18 21:56:59 I can feel the complaints warming up!
935 2018-01-18 21:56:38 Very sad to hear my former boss (when I lived in FL) passed away. I learned a lot from him about the oil and gas industry, faith, and Norway.

937 2018-01-18 21:55:59 Thank you!  Used strictly oil paint brush and palette knife here. Except for the back ground.  Used a bit of airbrush tool on that.
938 2018-01-18 21:55:54 Which is why Russia so successful with playing him. And don't buy this fake anger at Russia on N.K. oil bit.

942 2018-01-18 21:55:02 Footlong BMT on Italian Herbs bread, toasted, w/ Provolone, Lettuce, Cucumbers, Onions, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano. And then a side of baked Lays chips and a coke
943 2018-01-18 21:54:46 Is that why you opened up more oil drilling and are trying to bring back the dying industry that is coal? As opposed to thinking BIG and looking at alternative, renewable and clean energy sources like almost every other developed country in the world.
944 2018-01-18 21:54:23 And you are the snake oil salesman speaking with a forked tongue dripping honey. You tell Americans what you think they want to hear and then do nothing, nothing at all, to help the average American. History will be most unkind when telling your story.
945 2018-01-18 21:54:21 No Obama described me as “bitter” because I am pro gun and pro religion. Saying I’m not a real woman because I don’t buy into your snake oil sales is pretty nasty doc.

947 2018-01-18 21:53:29 Fish intake didn't reach statistical significance between the groups. Less meat, dairy, butter and more margarine and oil did. You agree margarine and oils aren't whole foods, right?
948 2018-01-18 21:52:38 This 10 year old kid had on boots, a t shirt from a bar in OBX and a Cummins hat. Guess the oil wells really will take anyone without a high school diploma
949 2018-01-18 21:52:37 If you really want to make a meal to remember, use oregano oil.

954 2018-01-18 21:51:51 Absurd to have another record #Crude #Inventory #Draw on #EIA... & #Crude #Oil $CL_F couldn't rally?! ...yet RBOB gasoline was +1.19%, also the U.S. Dollar was again lower! Talk about manipulation. Should have easily been testing 65+ today already...
955 2018-01-18 21:51:50 @debra12862 have you used hemp oil. I started selling Zilis and bought some for my dad who has bad pain in his knees and back and now it is very minimal.
956 2018-01-18 21:51:47 If someone as no-nonesense as Pharah is getting a pretty dress and make-up skin, every male character should have comically macho skins with no shirts and extra glamour oil
957 2018-01-18 21:51:43 When your husband laughs at you instead of helping because you can’t put olive oil in your ear 
958 2018-01-18 21:51:22 The film rights to Ardern’s life could do for New Zealand what oil did for Saud
959 2018-01-18 21:51:14 CBD (cannabis) oil was very helpful for me. I use Kanaway brand 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon daily.  The rest is mind/spiritual work.
960 2018-01-18 21:50:59 Surprisingly I agree with the climate changes and how we need to adapt to something better than big oil.  I saw somewhere that I’d take about 3-400 acres and make them a solar farm it can produce enough energy to power America now and plus another increase in population
961 2018-01-18 21:50:52 I got some commuter jeans from dish & duer...water/oil/spill resistance + stretchiness has made my walks home in the rain a lot more pleasant
962 2018-01-18 21:50:47 Is that why you want to invest in oil instead of clean energy? Does that move us forward?
963 2018-01-18 21:50:38 Any oil can be essential if your pancakes are sticking.
964 2018-01-18 21:50:36 I'am starting to wrap my head around the implications of the decline in availability of heavy oil out of Canada and Venezuela. Thanks for your insights.

966 2018-01-18 21:50:28 Maybe chili olive oil.
967 2018-01-18 21:50:07 Trevor, is there truth to the claim that hydro resources are not treated in the same fashion as oil and gas, and lumber?
968 2018-01-18 21:50:05 My fav part of the movie is when they compare cost of bottle water to the cost of quart of oil. This was way before the bottled water craze. Very prophetic but also very true.

980 2018-01-18 21:49:02 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
981 2018-01-18 21:48:44 Some places do if you bring ur own oil
982 2018-01-18 21:48:29 You said watching the video is a vote... am I allowed to vote for everyone? I think all that's being done in these charitable deeds should lead the advertising, in my personal opinion. Kudos for the good deeds all the same.
983 2018-01-18 21:48:16 honey and olive oil is a great diy for a lip mask wow
984 2018-01-18 21:48:09 I love drinking hot oil. 
985 2018-01-18 21:48:08 Yep. I saw it after the housing market crash. People lost their jobs, lost their unemployment and had no prospects. They packed up and some lived in their vehicles to work in the Bakken oil field of North Dakota.
986 2018-01-18 21:47:57 The tide pod challenge is just as fucked up as the cinnamon challenge was! What's next? WD-40, motor oil, anti freeze, gasoline? Come on....

987 2018-01-18 21:47:48 @franklymccoy Hi Frankie sent email invite to your Standard address but it came back. Invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner 23 Jan at Osteria dell'Angolo rest. in Westminster, just following up, was wondering if you can come? Can resend email. tx. @luisawelch
988 2018-01-18 21:47:48 my first thought was; "but you use olive oil and beeswax on polearms" ..
989 2018-01-18 21:47:38 I use plenty of coconut oil, and I’ve been known to make ice cream with some MCT oil added. Ok, totally honest here, I’ve put both of those and butter in my coffee. But this bullet proof guy takes the absurdist claims to a whole new level.
990 2018-01-18 21:47:36 Yeah like 136k tons of oil.
991 2018-01-18 21:47:33 girlllll a drop or two of a face oil (can be purchased in a skincare aisle), or a rose spray does the trick, at least for a little bit, to break up the surface dryness!
992 2018-01-18 21:47:09 Oil is not the future…..But. it is the present…..We must create renewable, environmental sustainable & clean technologies for tomorrow, today, whilst implementing them into a successful society by infusing job creation and multiskilling into our economies.
993 2018-01-18 21:46:58 This is the best beauty product on Earth. Combine 2 grams of cannabis seed oil with 1 gram of cannabis concentrate. Heat in the oven at 275 F for 45 minutes in a small container covered in wax paper. Apply to your skin and watch as ALL blemishes of every kind disappear!
994 2018-01-18 21:46:35 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
995 2018-01-18 21:46:32 ooh that sounds lovely Sam, have u ever done these veggies roasted with rock salt & olive oil & garlic in the air fryer? I bet they taste so good? I thank u so much for telling me about the air fryer I bought nick one last Christmas it’s a awesome piece of equipment eh?
996 2018-01-18 21:46:23 All this to say, you're right—high enough $ would bring enough cobalt to market.

But $ would likely need to jump more than oil did due to lower supply elasticity; those higher prices would test elasticity of battery demand, potentially before you reached primary supply threshold
997 2018-01-18 21:46:15 and now I want some oil really bad.
998 2018-01-18 21:46:14 A snake oil salesman is better respected..
999 2018-01-18 21:46:11 Check out @BahiCosmetics they have a few products that’ll help you out in many ways. Also rosehip oil has been helping me out
1000 2018-01-18 21:45:46 Bought a big jar of coconut oil and i went overboard today  i feel great
1001 2018-01-18 21:45:44 My mom would never forgive me if I put them in the oven! We are old school! Rolling the tortilla all hot from the oil while it burns our fingers!
1002 2018-01-18 21:45:33 Denver judge says an oil and gas company committed securities fraud
1003 2018-01-18 21:45:27 Disaster ,look what’s happened to our fishing industry,oil,manufacturing,it’s been sucked up by EU and jobs gone to former Eastern Bloc.,meanwhile a couple of million EU workers have taken our jobs,homes,we have 10 million more immigrants in 10 years that we know of
1004 2018-01-18 21:45:19 Don’t feel like waiting to get my oil changed.
1005 2018-01-18 21:45:19 two spoons of warm oil+cheese+pepperoni. Its not just oil
1006 2018-01-18 21:45:16 Reading you comments to this Tweet, and i wonder, "Does your audience not know about syria,libya, going off us dollar for oil", or are you not covering the real "Happenings" in the world. 

Both parties will ensure the corporate interests are upheld, #CIA is corporate security.
1007 2018-01-18 21:45:12 Who is behind this - Russia, China, EU, Illuminati? Where will it be centralized? It was George Bush the 1st that talked about the New World Order after the first middle East war which was all about oil. Thought plan was US control it.
1008 2018-01-18 21:45:09  Something on this list is not like the others... 

Why do you need olive oil from the school?!
1009 2018-01-18 21:45:06 So long as science is not respected we won't be able to. The deniers, while relatively small on a global scale, have the loudest voice in the U.S. thanks to big oil $$. It's no coincidence that the loudest voices against the science also received substantial $$ from fossil fuels.
1010 2018-01-18 21:44:55 yo who cares about a little oil we're all going to die ...I will sacrifice a couple shitty years at the end for more awesome years now
1011 2018-01-18 21:44:54 Master stroke by @porinju buying confidence petroleum and Selan exploration. With Oil price going high and today GST reduction,all in favour
1012 2018-01-18 21:44:53 >not downing 3 spoons of warm oil
1013 2018-01-18 21:44:42 I think we know what this is about.  It was Forte oil chairman a couple of nights ago. Today the @APCNigeria chieftains.

With Otedola, it was the money with the chieftains the support.

1014 2018-01-18 21:44:42 But seriously, who has oil lamps in libraries!?

1015 2018-01-18 21:44:39 I like to wash/condistion my hair when when I am finished I put organic coconut oil all in my hair and sleep with it until morning and just wash it out. Do it 1-2 times a week and it made my hair really healthy
1016 2018-01-18 21:44:33 Turkey wants the Kurdish oil fields. Watch out!
1017 2018-01-18 21:44:30 Well, duh, Captain Obvious. You should stick to selling snake oil or crystal balls. 

News alert: He’s not.
1018 2018-01-18 21:44:20 Your talking about to vastly different sized oil and gas fields. So who's up in the grand scheme from 2014. With those numbers Saskatchewan is and Alberta is about half of its usual investment.  In 2014 the price of oil was 65 a barrel so wheres the other 30 billion.
1019 2018-01-18 21:44:11 Bergy aint getting fired, Geoff is all in with the Snake Oil Salesman. Molson will step aside as President & they will hire a Quital or Damphousse as a FIGUREHEAD to pretend they changed stuff & market to the masses. Mark my words on this guys.
1020 2018-01-18 21:44:06 anybody know how our tourism has been affected by Trump? can't imagine there's many flocking to Hawaii with missile alerts, coastal oil rigs, hurricanes, & racism...
1021 2018-01-18 21:44:05 I have had a huge anxiety problem for nearly 30 years. Did a hell  of a lot of research for benefits and found that cbd does indeed help with anxiety.  Then I did more research on quality and found hempworx has the purest and a full spectrum oil. I did order some.
1022 2018-01-18 21:43:57 @josemangin I went to get my oil changed yesterday in Las Vegas NM and I was blasting @SXMOctane in the car and they were blasting it in the garage.
1023 2018-01-18 21:43:53 He sicks big time. He’s a snake oil seller.
1024 2018-01-18 21:43:53 It’s the oil not the labor lol
1025 2018-01-18 21:43:50 "But he makes loud clanking noises when he gets shaken around. Maybe he's trying to tell you to oil him more?"
1026 2018-01-18 21:43:38 Calling Domino’s to order “twelve spoons of warm oil” cause I’m extremely funny and smart
1027 2018-01-18 21:43:36 I've only ever ordered one sampler craft beer box and it included a mini-can of 20/30% stout that looked and tasted like sump oil.
1028 2018-01-18 21:43:34 They created the problem of scalability? And how about when you and a cabal of bitmain miners created the NYA without the involvement of bitcoin developers? But making he blocksize bigger will solve scalability. Snake oil salesman.

1031 2018-01-18 21:43:06 I’ve been receiving a lot of compliments on my scent lately, so here’s my secret: I mix lavender oil into the almond oil I use to moisturize my hair and body.
1032 2018-01-18 21:42:53 trying to listen to the Inherent Vice soundtrack while getting my oil changed and Big Bang Theory canned laughter from the tv keeps interrupting

1036 2018-01-18 21:42:22 I’ve been trying to mostly replace my vyvanse with CBD oil bc ADD medication just isn’t great and I feel a lot more present and I’m sleeping like a (semi) normal person and I’ve been calm and able to (semi) concentrate and I can’t wait to see the full effects 10/10 I recommend it

1038 2018-01-18 21:41:53 nothin like spilling vape oil in your Michael Kors purse 
1039 2018-01-18 21:41:29 If the ~ 40 pages I’ve read so far tells me anything, it’s that @TGowdySC has zero interest in protecting Americans against propaganda and hacking and is nothing more than a fast talking snake oil salesman trying to save the “conservative movement”.
1040 2018-01-18 21:41:25 Coconut oil is so underrated
1041 2018-01-18 21:41:20 Who's eating warm oil?
1042 2018-01-18 21:41:14 @JasonTorchinsky, How could anyone possibly resist buying such high-tech snake oil from a wannabe Frankie Valli knock-off. This guys screams legit to me... OK, maybe he just screams. Makes me miss New Jersey ;-)
1043 2018-01-18 21:41:08 Now playing Oil Of The Lord by Kevin Lemons & Higher Calling!
1044 2018-01-18 21:40:48 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1045 2018-01-18 21:40:44 You're the kind of guy who keeps adding oil to your car without fixing the leak.The oil never stops leaking and ruins the entire city for everyone else.Fix the leak, then add oil.Worse, we're offering to fix YOUR oil leak for you but you refuse bc we called your car a POS.

1048 2018-01-18 21:40:17 Well, goodbye to the old civic. Its race was run; its AC was shot, it had a squeaky belt, and fixing an oil leak some weeks before ended up costing more than the car itself. But it did survive a lightning strike many years ago!
1049 2018-01-18 21:40:13 Was just thinking... since every other guy who uses your oil is being signed up by WWE, should @StephenLouch and me form a tag team and we will get signed? 
1050 2018-01-18 21:40:11 More stupid because the majority of the state is heavily agricultural so production would do wonders for the economy in our rural areas but being in the deep south, I'm astonished they approved the oil, took outrage from citizens relocated to CO to treat kids seizure to pass it
1051 2018-01-18 21:40:10 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。

1059 2018-01-18 21:39:26 I need to buy some tea tree oil asap
1060 2018-01-18 21:39:19 I've said it for a while, Romans oil money is running out. Not even targeting Sanchez either? They can no longer afford to compete for top players. Chelskis 15 minutes of fame is over. Those people who blamed Emenalo for the bad recent recruitment need to apologise.

1063 2018-01-18 21:39:02 From what I heard, if you don't use it - they might sell your portion of rice, sugar, oil and kerosene to others. To account for it, they use your card as everyone gets to purchase a limited amount of groceries.
1064 2018-01-18 21:38:56 Who suggested this? 
Maybe if they want to condition it, strengthen it maybe???
There are more antibiotic properties in Coconut Oil, &anti-inflammatories too

1067 2018-01-18 21:38:37 I like using a combo of the powder & aerosol version. I prefer to use the powder near the scalp as I feel it absorbs oil better & I use the aerosol version for the rest of my hair.
1068 2018-01-18 21:38:35 That was fake news I just tried three spoonfuls of warm oil and they’re not equivalent at all Pizza is way better
1069 2018-01-18 21:38:33 No offense, but all of the things you listed are consistent with obesity, whether it is induced by sodas, muffins, olive oil, or spinach. Strong arming for me to isn’t supported by evidence except for in uncommon genetic or disease populations.

1150 2018-01-18 21:28:13 #markettochat trust the oil of the future 
1151 2018-01-18 21:28:09 How many spoins of cold oil?
1152 2018-01-18 21:28:04 I need to follow you. Once my Cryptocurrencies hit a specific $, Gbam! Ama pm you for the oil business.
1153 2018-01-18 21:27:49 i don’t think i’d be fond of oil in my mouth either but i wanted to try lol & im about to send you this magical website I came across yesterday
1154 2018-01-18 21:27:42 So I just put a big ass spoon full of cannabis coconut oil in my oatmeal and lemme tell you I’m higher than balls. Let’s get this work day started  now to get munchies lmao
1155 2018-01-18 21:27:42 if u don’t have coconut oil, baby oil works just as great 
1156 2018-01-18 21:27:42 lol get a real bottle of Olive oil and rub it and massage ur breast for 2 to 4 mins 2 times a day check for results in 2 weeks
1157 2018-01-18 21:27:37 fuck it, i'll take the 2 slices *and* the three spoons of warm oil
1158 2018-01-18 21:27:24 No, the 3x ETF's eat too much into my buying power. For whatever reason, Interactive Brokers is really strict on them, especially overnight BP. However, I do use $UWT to watch oil during the day, as it is a little more sensitive than $USO. Also hate the decay on 3x overnights.
1159 2018-01-18 21:27:05 Oil
1160 2018-01-18 21:26:26 I got lavender oil on my water bottle mouthpiece and now it taste like I’m drinking soap.... 
1161 2018-01-18 21:26:15 Rife in the oil industry. Say that your earning up to lower tax band and take the rest in dividends. The notion of self employment in that industry is a joke. Told what to work on, use company computers, told what hours to work. Suits employers too, no NI contributions.
1162 2018-01-18 21:26:12 None of which apply here.  And if you include ISPs as utilities, they damn well better care about customer wants, because they have competition.

The oil example is irrelevant, because oil is fungible; oil is oil.  Nobody HAS opinions on crude.
1163 2018-01-18 21:26:05 i was thinking it was because they still have oil and we want it
1164 2018-01-18 21:26:02 We need to get off of Islamic oil for we are destroying what God created for us
1165 2018-01-18 21:26:01 Car: Oil Change
Me: *waits two weeks*
Nissan: 60$
Me: okay
Nissan: you also need to rotate your tires
Nissan: 100$
Me:  ok
1166 2018-01-18 21:26:01 How crazy is it that you can google Coles grandpas name and it brings up the oil drill he patented
1167 2018-01-18 21:25:49 Yup. That’s why we can’t get CBD oil. Even without THC. But our families are here so here we stay
1168 2018-01-18 21:25:44 And where and how do you think the Kurds will sell that oil?
1169 2018-01-18 21:25:43 Didn’t know that some essential oils such as lavender, tea tree oil and peppermint are toxic to cats. I’ll stop using them now. #catslovers #cats #essentialoils
1170 2018-01-18 21:25:28 Burger King just need to leave their nuggets in the oil longer. They are not crispy at all.. they are mad nasty
1171 2018-01-18 21:25:18 Yes, just a routine oil check. But I think I've been noticing some subtle jerks in the past weeks. Don't know if I could attribute that to the oil. Anyway, I'll drive carefully like you said. Thanks a lot
1172 2018-01-18 21:25:14 I hope it is wrong. But one after other incidents in every province of Pakistan in such political turm oil, raises question mark in my mind. Specially when they are raised &  given such focus & coverage in social & e-media. It'd be very unfort in this case.
1173 2018-01-18 21:25:06 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1174 2018-01-18 21:25:04 Coconut oil is the soul blessing for hair and skin.
1175 2018-01-18 21:25:00 Climate change is inevitable.  What we call #GlobalWarming can't be stopped.

There was no #carbonfootprint at the end of the Ice Age.  There were no oil refineries, no cars, no factories.

It's all natural.

Do the right thing - fight for what is REALLY important!
1176 2018-01-18 21:24:54 It agree, right now our Country in the situation it’s in we don’t have any choice We have to Vote Democrats to save Democracy. I agree we need at least 3 Viable Parties. Just not Libertarian or Green unless Green can get it’s act together w/Good Candidates Who Don’t Invest in Oil

The Book of Ecclesiastes says: "A good name is better than precious oil." 
Feld's Corollary is: "So you better get the best price you can, because you can only sell it once."

1178 2018-01-18 21:24:40 Mark my words. Oil pans will be the death of me. The oracle has prophesied it and so it shall be.
1179 2018-01-18 21:24:38 Why is Charlie's name in my phone "Dick Dipper"? 
I'm glad you asked. 

Basically it involves a bottle of olive oil, a housemates cup and his penis. 

So now you know. 

You're welcome.
1180 2018-01-18 21:24:15 The other side of the benefit was to reduce competition to Saudi oil.
1181 2018-01-18 21:24:13 Dude I just say I'm poor and want the cheapest oil change and nothing more every single time lol
1182 2018-01-18 21:23:57 Lavender essential oil+my diffuser is a heavenly combo.
1183 2018-01-18 21:23:48 Honey, energy drink, bell, ribena, sth that can give u wings, ginger/garlic smoothie, water, anointing oil, coconut oil, massage oils, Holy Ghost oil, hot sauce, blood tonic, beet root juice...pls I'm coming, let me take d stool away first...
Too much juice, too much sauce...
1184 2018-01-18 21:23:45 That this will not happen, it is illegal to issue debt from oil reserves in Venezuela. What this cryptocurrency will do is continue feeding the corruption, allowing the government to continue issue debt they cannot longer pay, and allow them to do illicit activities. (1)
1185 2018-01-18 21:23:40 Oops! But yes very!
Thank you i'm good, burning the midnight oil!
Hope youre well!
1186 2018-01-18 21:23:18 But if price were sufficient, you could extract those just to get the cobalt too, no? gas used to be waste product of oil demand, but then higher prices created incentives to go for the gas itself.
1187 2018-01-18 21:23:05 I doubt if most healthy people eating LCHF are using soybean oil.
1188 2018-01-18 21:22:58 I feel awkward even buying a  in Asda now ..... a love them grilled aswell with olive oil
1189 2018-01-18 21:22:55 Arguably had the opposition not called the  oil strike which in turn led to the government sacking most of the skilled personnel, collapse in the economy and an increase in authoritarianism the mere nationalisation of the oil industry would have been just fine.
1190 2018-01-18 21:22:54 In general tho. Black ppl don’t reach for it because of the oil in their formula
1191 2018-01-18 21:22:52 The military has over spent much of the gov/people’s money ... who gets richer when we pump up the military? (Oil, the metal industry, etc... billionaires)
1192 2018-01-18 21:22:48 They need a war to create an oil crisis so they can remove sanctions and make them all a ton of money with Putin
1193 2018-01-18 21:22:46 @LeeCamp So, let the oil companies pay for the expenditures to the military to keep the oil flowing then...
1194 2018-01-18 21:22:32 Add some MCT Oil to your diet. It’s great in Coffee, water, and salads! Keep pushing bro 
1195 2018-01-18 21:22:29 Where's the Essential Oil that makes Kale not taste like a hippie's nutsack?
1196 2018-01-18 21:22:22 The opaque world of the global maritime industry makes it exceedingly difficult to prevent North Korea from obtaining oil, despite sanctions.
1197 2018-01-18 21:22:10 Mr. trump is a wealthy man.   The promises he has kept are ones that benefit him and his wealthy friends, including the oil industry.
1198 2018-01-18 21:22:07 Its called bole.  Spiced and smoked fish with plantain and yam with a very palatable oil stew to compliment.
1199 2018-01-18 21:22:04 I use olbas oil. A few drops on so tissue. Helps open airways and stops the coughing. It is available at most supermarkets. Done put it too near though as it can be strong smelling

1203 2018-01-18 21:21:41 Currently burning lavender essential oil hoping it will help me sleep. Last night was ridiculous 
1204 2018-01-18 21:21:38 Add the actual 3 spoons of oil I put on my pizza and is even better
1205 2018-01-18 21:21:37 Everything Julie, 44, from Colchester on Mumsnet said about using baby oil was right 
1206 2018-01-18 21:21:36 That was nearly funny Aberdeen Troglodyte!!
You horrible race of people up there would still be in the tattie fields if it wasn't for the oil.. 
1207 2018-01-18 21:21:29 Peppermint is the only essential oil I can put in the diffuser at work that doesn’t make me sneeze all day.
1208 2018-01-18 21:21:25 instead of drinking wine on the couch and watching legally blonde, i spent my snow day going to the dentist and getting my oil changed & i’m here to tell u being responsible sucks
1209 2018-01-18 21:21:24 Probably somewhere with some imported olive oil in my hair
1210 2018-01-18 21:21:20 No, no it is not. The outrage merchants are much like snake oil salesmen. It is not the fault of the victims of their scams that the salemen sells his wares, but merely parasitically opportunism to an existing plight. Outrage merchants thrive because the media promotes it, not us
1211 2018-01-18 21:21:14 Lyon wasn't based on whole foods... Butter was replaced with a canola oil based margarine for example. Do you consider that a whole food? Butter is more a whole food than margarine yet margarine was healthier.
1212 2018-01-18 21:21:08 you ever cooking and burning oil splashes up and hits your hand? ya it's not fun....
1213 2018-01-18 21:21:02 Walter Wagbatsoma's UK case that started in June 2016, 4yrs after a Lagos High Court began his trial, was concluded 9 days ahead of his Nigeria N1.9Billion oil subsidy case. He is in jail in the UK. His accomplices in the Nigeria case are still hiding under appeal.

1216 2018-01-18 21:20:45 Although I boycotted the games this year in support of my friend, Aaron Bailey, who was shot and killed by two IMPD officers on June 29th. I protested outside Lucas Oil for one game, in solidarity w/Colin Kaepernick and Black Lives Matter @usblm
1217 2018-01-18 21:20:25 (2) Venezuela is oil rich & people r suffering/starving under socialism/dictatorship. It’s never about race/skin color. It’s about corrupt government who starve their people. North Korea....same thing.
1218 2018-01-18 21:20:19 I see @NamiMamiArtist and @Jruffhouse videos with their oil paints and it makes me want to get out of my comfort zone and try them.
1219 2018-01-18 21:20:15 ふおお、素晴らしい情報ありがとうございます〜。ボウルの湯気がすぐなくなっちゃうので数分でやめてたのですが、バスタオル被るのですね！ olbas oil は残念ながらないのでアロマテラピーアソシエイトのオイル入れてやってみます〜。

1225 2018-01-18 21:19:05 Woman next to me: “Can you tell me what the calamari is fried in?”

Server: “It’s fried in vegetable oil.”

Woman: “So it’s not fried in duck fat or lard?””

Server: “No.”

Woman: “So there’s absolutely no animal product in the oil?  I want nothing living in it.”

Ummmm...
1226 2018-01-18 21:19:01 A head full of coconut oil every time my mother get in my hair
1227 2018-01-18 21:18:55 The past two times I’ve gone to get my oil change one of the workers creeped on my paperwork & have added me on social media...
1228 2018-01-18 21:18:54 £80 a week? I could make that work - two new tyres on the front, two new tyres on the back, oil/filter/plugs and then on the final week I'd replace the exhaust from the manifold back as a special end-of-month treat.
1229 2018-01-18 21:18:46 They'd just have them all annexed into the Jiffy Lube so they could abort WHILE getting an oil change.
1230 2018-01-18 21:18:29 Cauliflower cheesie bread!! It’s so good use the cauliflower as the bread and oil and mozzarella cheese on top, so good!!!
1231 2018-01-18 21:18:20 The opaque world of the global maritime industry makes it exceedingly difficult to prevent North Korea from obtaining oil, despite sanctions.
1232 2018-01-18 21:18:08 Also, oil is consumed in its use, whereas cobalt could theoretically be recycled from old batteries into new ones.

Strongly agree on need for better data on supply and environmental impacts from cobalt and other components of energy systems.
1233 2018-01-18 21:18:05 If I die now, I'd die happy. With a smile on my face and the oil from the peppered chicken I just downed still on my fingers.
Yes lawd.

1235 2018-01-18 21:18:01 I just saw this somewhere else! I must try! Do you rinse the oil cleanser off before applying foam cleanser?
1236 2018-01-18 21:17:53 Seller of snake oil in a traveling medicine show.
1237 2018-01-18 21:17:43 Jesus turned over the tables and caused all kinds of issues in the Temple gates.  He told Mary, "You will always have the poor wit with you..." letting people know it was okay to buy perfume and not always spend money on needs of others. That perfume became his annointing oil.
1238 2018-01-18 21:17:39 been using wrong oil for my cars, and i go school o. simple manufacturer specification i failed to check. smh!
1239 2018-01-18 21:17:17 The state I reside in came up with by far the stupidest solution It's legal to possess & prescribe cannabis oil but it can't be produced or dispensed here so residents have to go out of state for dispensing & commit multiple felonies to bring it home Just moronic
1240 2018-01-18 21:17:02 oil cleansing method, é basicamente um tratamento usando só óleos naturais
1241 2018-01-18 21:16:43 @BeerBods fair play. This beer has transported me to Aberdeen. No it really has. I started to drink it in suburban Cardiff and now I'm staring at an oil rig.  And its snowing
1242 2018-01-18 21:16:43 I really could use a boyfriend when I need air in my tires, an oil change, and that kinda stuff. Then I think about how exhausting it is to be a good woman anddddd I get over it. Rather not. 

*looks for quarters to put air in my tires*

1245 2018-01-18 21:16:27 Depends on the kind of oil, really.
1246 2018-01-18 21:16:22 They just want attention, and that's exactly what they're getting.
1247 2018-01-18 21:16:20 I mean, I had today for supper a tomato and sweet peppers salad and capers, with virgin olive oil and 2 sardines roasted on hot coals. I honestly do not live I could not live w/out fresh vegetables.
1248 2018-01-18 21:16:19 The way I’m craving a truffle oil prosciutto Pizza with a fried egg right now is unreal.
1249 2018-01-18 21:16:18 Castor oil has saved my lashes and brows I cannot say it enough
1250 2018-01-18 21:15:53 And probably true. Yet Bama still crushed Clemson and beat a very good Georgia team. Even leaking oil, #RollTide is still the best car on the track.
1251 2018-01-18 21:15:51 The oil won't have the carbs at least.
1252 2018-01-18 21:15:45 I’ve done absolutely nothing today but put make up on and check the oil in the car
1253 2018-01-18 21:15:39 Savoy is more tender raw, I think, my mom always makes that way, sliced really fine with olive oil and vinegar
1254 2018-01-18 21:15:33 i'm so into essential oil lately - will def try this out. you're full of shower knowledge. im going to be so clean!
1255 2018-01-18 21:15:29 Didn’t it happen the very day #drumpfutin ended oil drilling regulations?  Thanks for your teeets.
1256 2018-01-18 21:15:21 If your cough is bad put Eucalyptus or tea tree oil on your chest and back to loosen up your cough.
1257 2018-01-18 21:15:07 I love how I go in for an oil change and then they tell me my car needs $300 worth of work done 
1258 2018-01-18 21:15:04 Females don't never check their oil. They just put gas in the car and drive.
1259 2018-01-18 21:15:04 Dreamers are immigrants, we need to either kick them all out or develop comprehensive over arching all encompassing immigration reform. #RAISEact puts the dreamers first, and saves America from the “sh*thole” factor.
1260 2018-01-18 21:14:55 How else were we supposed to steal all the oil?
1261 2018-01-18 21:14:42 Three bags for an oil change. This was higher dollar layer feed I think I gave $13 or $14 a bag. I had it for carp fishing, though, not chickens

1265 2018-01-18 21:14:07 "Upholding international laws" by the 2 Leaders. Does that include REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa or the Stealing of their oil exclude them from international laws?.
1266 2018-01-18 21:14:03 I need a boyfriend so he can do oil changes on my car cause fuck all of that lmao
1267 2018-01-18 21:14:02 Alright ladies, the date is February 14th 2018, you walk into a room and see 4 naked guys with the aroma of Bengay and baby oil wondering in the air, but you only happen to have 3 sets of men’s clothing on you... Who do you leave naked?
1268 2018-01-18 21:13:39 Score & salt it now. then pepper more salt and oil rubbed in before cooking.  start high in hot oven turn, down to cook, last 20 mins on high.  Mostly works, sometime doesn't.  A lot to do with the quality of the joint.
1269 2018-01-18 21:13:34 We have a joke here in the bunker: If every time someone makes a broad conclusion or market assessment from a change in weekly U.S. crude oil production, a Forrestal cockroach died...we'd still have plenty of cockroaches...
1270 2018-01-18 21:13:31 Don't forget denying healthcare to millions to give wealthy a tax cut, denying healthcare to children, paying large subsidies to oil companies, supporting predatory payday lending,  trying to privatize vet care, cutting Medicare, & list goes on.
1271 2018-01-18 21:13:28 It's Oil City, how dare they!
1272 2018-01-18 21:13:26 Prior 2 pontificating, perhaps u may want 2 go on a hunger strike in protest of illegals, as they r  life blood of  food & hospitality industry.. also work on oil rigs...so u may want to stop heating home & driving too....or building anything as they r mainstay in construction
1273 2018-01-18 21:13:21 @ThomasJDonohue I support the gas tax. Not only will it pay for infrastructure but it'll also encourage the adoption of EV's. As the Japanese took advantage of an oil crisis in the 70's to gain major U.S market share, the Chinese are now poised to do the same with EV's.

1276 2018-01-18 21:12:54 Venezuela was a single-resource economy that manipulated it's own currency on the assumption that oil prices would stay high. The Saudis undermined Venezuela, Iran, Russia w/new pumping. Billions of dollars is spent by USA to undermine Venezuela as well. Our tax dollars at work!

1284 2018-01-18 21:11:47 My doctor has become my snake oil salesman, he just convinced me to buy a bottle of his new probiotic. I am such an idiot
1285 2018-01-18 21:11:39 Yeah! I did. As long as the makeup remover isn’t oil based. You can also buy specific mascara as well. It’s pricey though too.
1286 2018-01-18 21:11:38 Don't let Democrats hold function of gov, military and funding for American Citizens hostage to demands of illegal aliens. 
Americans 1st.
1287 2018-01-18 21:11:32 Untrue....their culture values and personal aparience make them so different from normal european so i wonder if they some day can behave as normal europeans do. The differances are too big i think. Its like water and oil
1288 2018-01-18 21:11:17 Iraq signs a memorandum of understanding w/ BP to boost production capacity from its northern Kirkuk oilfields to 750,000 barrels per day, more than twice existing capacity #Oil #Iraq #BP #Kirkuk
1289 2018-01-18 21:11:16 I never worry about oil changes, tire rotation, battery changes, new tires & all that extra shit.
1290 2018-01-18 21:11:15 Not big on seafood, but serve it with a kebab and stuff it with old fryer oil?!! can't! even!
1291 2018-01-18 21:11:09 hey, theres more hideous oil paintings of him he has to buy to decorate "his" craphole properties...
1292 2018-01-18 21:11:01 Sunken tanker off China’s coast leaks 100 sq km of oil slicks...
1293 2018-01-18 21:10:59 That's just overpriced coconut oil, right? Or am I missing something?
1294 2018-01-18 21:10:52 Oil companies need to stop damaging our oceans, a example needs to be made out this. They are destroying a major food supply.
1295 2018-01-18 21:10:35 Who is @Loreal trying to please with this ad? It certainly doesn’t do anything to influence a potential buyer when you can’t even see the impact of the product. Makeup maybe, but hair???

1297 2018-01-18 21:10:29 @BulkSupps I wanted to include your fish oil in an upcoming blog post: have you had it independently tested? If so, would you send me the results? Thanks!
1298 2018-01-18 21:10:25 has any of my followers tried oil pulling ? or brushing your teeth with coconut oil?
1299 2018-01-18 21:10:24 Everytime I come get my oil changed they always gotta tell me something else is wrong with my car

1302 2018-01-18 21:10:14 [re-reading] not exactly the same but reminds me of the progressive refractions of crude oil: gas petrol kerosene diesel residue (good policemen keep down riots - gcse chemistry mnemonic!)
1303 2018-01-18 21:10:14 Crypto industry relevancy lasting decades (& not months) only achievable with commodity derivative baskets

Perhaps selloff due to Venezuela crypto launch?

...but Crypto needs more than simple oil or Au/Ag backing

I have a #HAC crypto idea but better to tweet proposal February
1304 2018-01-18 21:10:09 Tea tree oil feels how spearmint tastes.

1307 2018-01-18 21:09:41 Capsicum is soluble in oil, not water. That's why drinking water never help when you eat something hot. Milk kind of works; it's got fat in it (skim won't help). But any fat or oil will remove the capsicum. Rub some oil on your face, then use soap and water to wash off the oil.
1308 2018-01-18 21:09:19 @Olive_oil_x
1309 2018-01-18 21:09:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1310 2018-01-18 21:09:06 True they added vegetable oils, but some Blue Zones consume olive oil. But you said "at all". The diet increased fruits, vegetables, grains, bread etc. So it's very similar. It was also lower in fat than control. I'd say it has a lot in common.
1311 2018-01-18 21:09:04 La blague de la blonde et du bouchon OIL qui t'a inspiré ? 
1312 2018-01-18 21:08:56 I need to get my oil changed, renew my tags, pay a parking ticket, and get new front tires for my car all this month  Adulting sucks sometimes lol
1313 2018-01-18 21:08:53 Love that Labo is fully recyclable and biogradable. Paying for pure clever design, not oil wells and pollution. Well done #Labo
1314 2018-01-18 21:08:38 Maybe change your expansionist gov that is hostile towards neighbors?
1315 2018-01-18 21:08:27 I’m getting really good at differentiating a well tanned yt from woc. Just eavesdropped my way into a confirmation that one olive oil mayo mama was “100% pure Canadian. Like 4th generation Canadian.” Ok. Kl.
1316 2018-01-18 21:08:27 omg so many products haha I just bought the coconut oil and this loreal mask for now which brand was your bleach? I know hahahaha I went to the salon twice to get my hair bleached and it's still like an autumn colour like wtf are they doing?!

1328 2018-01-18 21:06:38 same reason that cobalt was able to remain in oversupply far longer than oil; low prices didn't automatically prompt supply rationalization/sow seeds of higher prices. (my two cents -- I'd love better cobalt data for a more nuanced answer)
1329 2018-01-18 21:06:26 The ethics commissioner decided it without considering his lifelong friendship. And the Aga Khan’s business is CHARITY. How can being lobbied about administering charity be a bad thing. The Harper gang was in bed with the oil industry. They shared breakfasts.
1330 2018-01-18 21:06:23 Their Neck Oil is also rather fine.
1331 2018-01-18 21:06:15 Part One Trillions in welfare to corporate welfare queens each year more than spent on Military, Social Security each year.  Corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, Comcast, Apple, Facebook, Google, Facebook, prescription drugs, electricity, etc.  Lot of it very harmful
1332 2018-01-18 21:06:01 What's better for frying veg butter or oil ??
1333 2018-01-18 21:06:00 @PCNutriLabs I wanted to include your fish oil in an upcoming blog post: "Each batch is then third-party tested to ensure purity in every bottle." 
Would you send me the results? Thanks!
1334 2018-01-18 21:05:56 Yep! Coconut oil, some coffee (that’s the weird black water humans drink) and tacos that I’m making.
1335 2018-01-18 21:05:55 We currently stock 10W40 Engine oil.
1336 2018-01-18 21:05:53 Sorry, don't buy it.  If your prediction is that Fred's cancer, or knee injury, or headaches will be improved if Fred does X or Y or Z, or some combo, if that ain't falsifiable, with all due respect, you are selling snake oil.

1338 2018-01-18 21:05:42 I almost can't believe we could have 80 dollar oil this month if your graph holds up.
1339 2018-01-18 21:05:42 Her history of her private speech to Goldman Sachs on her "public/private positions," her acceptance of Big Oil money, her pro-fracking positions, telling environmentalists to "get a life," and yelling at Green Peace activists all say otherwise.
1340 2018-01-18 21:05:14 Forgot to wear a bra when I went to get my oil changed today lol
1341 2018-01-18 21:05:13 Great stuff. What would you do with that now? Scuff sheet? Oil & wax? Tape?
1342 2018-01-18 21:04:51 Based on his play last year, I was happy to see Pouliot moved. Based on all the Oil's cap space, not happy to see that buyout in retrospect.
1343 2018-01-18 21:04:46 Lead us to salvation pour that oil please! That's how we become Kings and Queens
1344 2018-01-18 21:04:44 Yes exactly right. We don't call oil 'natural oil' or coal 'natural coal. It is what it is & there's nothing natural about unmeasured fugitive methane escaping into the atmosphere in vast quantities....
1345 2018-01-18 21:04:40 Bruh wtf  doing an oil change is so fucking easy 
1346 2018-01-18 21:04:33 We dont buy our own oil. We sell it. We buy from Opec
1347 2018-01-18 21:04:27 My pro is really the coconut oil to my life

1351 2018-01-18 21:03:47 That’s a barrel? It definitely contains oil and It will definitely explode if I shoot at it - video game logic
1352 2018-01-18 21:03:45 Everytime I brush my hair, so much breaks off  I currently use OGX Moroccan oil and coconut milk oil, bedhead split end mender, garnier oatmilk heat protection spray, and body shop grape seed serum. Mask is some treseme hair bond repairing one

1354 2018-01-18 21:03:34 HY is, i think, where the most tension is rn , hidden a bit by oil component
1355 2018-01-18 21:03:32 Saudi Aramco is ready for its IPO in the 2nd half, w/ the government yet to decide where to list the shares, CEO Amin Nasser said #Oil #SaudiArabia #SaudiAramco #business
1356 2018-01-18 21:03:25 Yes, but there's not a single politician here in  that will admit that we're not rich. All of them sell the idea that we'd be rich if the other politicians hadn't stolen the oil revenue.
1357 2018-01-18 21:03:24 Biomass is not competitive on straight economics (other than true waste wood fiber burned at the mill) given better alternatives and low pricing of oil and gas.
1358 2018-01-18 21:03:08 I heard some rumors to this effect - that he and maybe Paul Ryan were recipients of Russian money, or oil money... so here it is saying that it is campaign money!  Thanks for posting.  I hope it is true.
1359 2018-01-18 21:03:08 also you look like you are sprinkled in coconut oil and black girl magic
1360 2018-01-18 21:02:57 your 1st example sure must bring to light the OIL$FOOD programe from UN, and some of leaders from #Pakistan were involved.
Your 2nd example I think #Rolex says it all. 
As for @MaryamNSharif if she can only read the life history of AMELDA MARCOS of Phillipines,Brazil, S.Korea
1361 2018-01-18 21:02:55 @Burdine12 Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
1362 2018-01-18 21:02:53 baby oil is my life saver
1363 2018-01-18 21:02:52 Definitely not guaranteed, but big diff between oil & cobalt is primary (oil) vs byproduct supply (cobalt); high oil $ drove investment in new supply, high cobalt $ won't have the same effect (driven by copper/nickel price). Bigger Q is demand destruction/substitution in MT/LT.
1364 2018-01-18 21:02:49 Mikey knows how to change oil and change tires
1365 2018-01-18 21:02:46 I don’t understand. There are egregious offenders in capitalism, but why pharma first? Why not the people who don’t test their products and sell them as medicine? Why not essential oil executives or pseudoscience shills or Walmart? Why are people who save lives such a target?

1373 2018-01-18 21:01:44 Two oil changes, new set of tires, alignment, rotation, annual insurance, smog, and registration all within 4 months. I’m over it, car. Stop being so needy 
1374 2018-01-18 21:01:20 No problem!! And you want to make sure the stuff in the bottle is 100% oil. A lot of ones at the grocery store will say that but then there’s a list of incredigents and that shouldn’t be the case.
1375 2018-01-18 21:01:00 Good place for a oil change in Charlotte??
1376 2018-01-18 21:00:59 Do these contain palm oil?

This from the R Commissioner. #nmleg #nmpol
1378 2018-01-18 21:00:45 DNB: total impression of this week’s US oil data was bullish. Total petroleum stocks drew a large 13.8 mboe and crude and the 4 main product stocks drew 6.4 mboe. Demand was reported at 20.8 mboe/day which is far stronger than the weak demand numbers we saw in January last year.
1379 2018-01-18 21:00:33 3 spoons of oil have never hurt anyone.
1380 2018-01-18 21:00:31 We know(!) the lines in Mid East set by UK & FR, we know(!) that oil and money is good enough cause for #EU to murder hundreds of thousands of #Muslims, we know(!) how much wonderful Christian EU ‘love’ Jews in #eu & anywhere what #eu did to bring peace...!

1382 2018-01-18 21:00:25 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1383 2018-01-18 21:00:19 I just burnt the shit out my scalp trying to do a hot oil treatment 
1384 2018-01-18 21:00:14 That's wonderful. In the meantime oil drilling will soon commence offshore due to #OrangeFoolius, to say nothing of micro-sized bits of plastic consumed by fish and seafood from currently existing ocean pollutants. Great to see #sustainability though!
1385 2018-01-18 21:00:11 Shoreline, a Nigerian oil producer, plans to almost double its crude output after agreeing a $530-m finance deal w/ Vitol > Shoreline will boost production to 80,000-100,000 bpd this year (the company currently pumps 55,000 bpd) #Oil #Nigeria #energy #business

1387 2018-01-18 21:00:02 It makes no sense to cast someone in a hijab for a hair commercial. 

Also, that stance on Israel is laughable.
1388 2018-01-18 20:59:51 The way i listed is the order of best. You base how good an oil company is off of how/where they source the plant. Because if the crop is sprayed with stuff then it’s no good and not pure oil you’re getting. So all 3 companies are aware of the crop and how then it’s turned to oil
1389 2018-01-18 20:59:40 going buy some baby oil and vaseline you hear
1390 2018-01-18 20:59:39 I want a robot that brings me doses of weed oil to relieve my body pain and headaches. I’d call it CBD3PO.
1391 2018-01-18 20:59:30 just applied the sunday riley luna sleeping oil to my face. can’t wait to see the results in the morning

1395 2018-01-18 20:59:05 Someone come pick my car up & get me an oil change 
1396 2018-01-18 20:58:22 Can't keep the Gulf clean from broken oil pipes, why would we want to spread that to the coasts where we go fishing?
1397 2018-01-18 20:58:16 No thanks, I'll keep my oil burner.
1398 2018-01-18 20:57:56 yeh i found it literally omw to make it! thank you n if it doesn’t work will defo try bio oil again
1399 2018-01-18 20:57:52 I like my coffee so strong it's like oil.

1403 2018-01-18 20:57:08 Trump : honor .... oil : water
1404 2018-01-18 20:56:56 Trump is selling our protected land to oil companies, separating hundreds of thousands of nonviolent immigrants from their families, and letting doctors refuse to treat patients based on their religion -- but liberals want to talk about what he eats and how much he weighs.
1405 2018-01-18 20:56:42 Both of them can go for all I care. Roman needs to give up some ownership to someone with oil money tbh
1406 2018-01-18 20:56:42 My brother we are very proud of Africa, see the country like Nigeria, we are not poor, America came to seek the petrol oil here because it don't have enough.
1407 2018-01-18 20:56:41 You just did a routine oil check right? or was there any unsual sound from under the hood ?
1408 2018-01-18 20:56:29 Come out today at 4:30 p.m. To support the Plex Neighborhood Association in fighting the proposed Brownfield cleanup at the old Vacuum Oil site on Flint & Exchange Streets!
1409 2018-01-18 20:56:15 Headgasket I think it has a misfire and loads of gunk in the oil cap
1410 2018-01-18 20:56:09 I was unaware that these evil oil companies broke into peoples homes and held a gun to their head to fill up their cars with gas.

I feel so woke now.
1411 2018-01-18 20:56:05 The royalty review was decades overdue and modernized and restored investors confidence. Oil support was ALWAYS for responsible oil development. Bormann brought the voices of ordinary citizens to the table that had always been ignored before.
1412 2018-01-18 20:55:56 depending on the type of oil, that's not necessarily "bad" either...
1413 2018-01-18 20:55:56 ..."Meanwhile, investment in Alberta’s oil and gas is expected to recover modestly this year to an estimated $31.1 billion, compared with $27 billion in 2016, $39.9 billion in 2015, and down sharply from $60.6 billion in 2014."
1414 2018-01-18 20:55:51 I was so productive last night and today. Manned through my pain and got my oil change payed bills and now I'm off to work 
1415 2018-01-18 20:55:49 Sounds like a viagra ad. Take your snake oil elsewhere, please.
1416 2018-01-18 20:55:33 nah abuelitas smell like corn oil and Suavitel
1417 2018-01-18 20:55:30 I love meeting badass girls. To the girl that just changed my oil thank you for beating every stereotype.
1418 2018-01-18 20:55:17 I just used coconut oil for the first time 
1419 2018-01-18 20:55:02 But it's alright for him to go to City who have got an unlimited supply of Arab oil money and not to a club who generate their own money
1420 2018-01-18 20:54:56 Replacing the rain in the lyrics “now the rain is just washing you out of my hair” with coconut oil and pink shampoo.
1421 2018-01-18 20:54:52 Gabe is gonna ask him to sign his coconut oil
1422 2018-01-18 20:54:40 Lmao please leave her RT @Rudebwoy_temi: Everyday I realize ceeyon is insane in the brain . The pastor needs to bathe her in anointing oil and holy water
1423 2018-01-18 20:54:26 I believe so, yes, with appropriate work along the way. A lot of other variables, of course, including who knows what from the Feds, but the combination of taxes, new oil production, and an untouched PF principal should see us safe for a long time.
1424 2018-01-18 20:54:21 My dad taught me how to change my oil, check the fluids and what not in a car but I just got my nails done and I’ll be damned. He doin it.
1425 2018-01-18 20:54:12 Tip from Venezuela: since the original oil boom in the 1920's there is no correlation between form of government (dictatorship/democracy) and wealth. E.g. from 1953-1973 Vzla grew an average of 6% w/ 1.8% inflation (1 dictator + 3 elected presidents).
1426 2018-01-18 20:54:02 deport it, burn it, use it as heating oil for the poor... give it back to KFC.
1427 2018-01-18 20:53:54 There is no gender gap, there are just gender preferences.
You don't hear them complain about the lack of women on oil rigs or driving trash trucks.
1428 2018-01-18 20:53:47 New York City just presented Exxon Mobil with a huge lawsuit for damages that city has sustained due to global warming. Big Oil privatizes the billions in profits, yet socializes the billions in losses.
1429 2018-01-18 20:53:35 I’ve been at the oil change place for over an hour and they haven’t even started my car 
1430 2018-01-18 20:52:31 Yikes. just ftr, if ya do have that ovary removed, afterward you may have severe breast pain. I took evening primrose oil for a few months and it went away.
1431 2018-01-18 20:52:30 風邪の時ではありますが、ゼーゼーゴホゴホ…器官がなかなか治らずNHS行ったらボウルに湯を張ってolbas oil ほんの数滴たらしてバスタオル被って30分 と言われやりました。とっても楽になりました よ。
1432 2018-01-18 20:52:19 police killing black people, oil pipelines, refugee crisis, climate change, media literacy, natural resources; and of course, the iPhone.
1433 2018-01-18 20:52:01 I have a university degree in economics and worked in the oil industry for years but yeah you're much brighter because you ticked a different box on 23rd June 2016.
1434 2018-01-18 20:51:34 "That's the spirit. Now just relax and let go~."

Lana says softly and she doused her hands in oil and slowly rubs it up Dovahkini's legs.
1435 2018-01-18 20:51:32 "Global oil and gas companies slashed capital expenditures by about 40 percent between 2014 and 2016. As part of this cost-cutting campaign, some 400,000 workers were let go, and major projects that did not meet profitability criteria were either canceled or deferred."
1436 2018-01-18 20:51:22 When you have hair oil worth about £40 that lasts about a year and your mum manages to use a bottle in 4 months 
1437 2018-01-18 20:51:21 Ok, so just to clarify. You are against government regulations for financial institutions, oil drilling and processing, employee safety, franking, environmental issues, and health care?
1438 2018-01-18 20:51:14 You’d clean your house, get the oil changed in your car, and go to bed early.

1444 2018-01-18 20:50:31 So Rajasthan will be self sufficient in fuel with these IMMENSE gas and oil reserves that's what you mean? 
1445 2018-01-18 20:50:25 maybe try the dupe?? i think it's called re-gen oil, dk if the ingredients are the same though x
1446 2018-01-18 20:50:15 Going to hold HIVE overnight exited TMF:US 2% loss not liking the action on Bonds and rates here.  I think tomorrow trading is going to be quite interesting.  Would like to see oil lower tomorrow.
1447 2018-01-18 20:50:11 Oil?
1448 2018-01-18 20:50:05 I'll bet the turnout was fantastic considering all the jobs there are dying. The great snake oil salesman.

1452 2018-01-18 20:49:27 And yet the oil still drives the world and our shitty government is trying to get rid of it
1453 2018-01-18 20:49:22 Sell it somewhere else. Any time he doesn't act like a demento doesn't make his snake oil any better. Lies
1454 2018-01-18 20:49:20 Thank you 
1455 2018-01-18 20:49:14 What part of Hillary doesn't give a damn about the environment and has taken more Big Oil money than Trump are you having a problem with?
1456 2018-01-18 20:49:08 do u know anything else that works coz bio oil breaks me out SO badly but i need it
1457 2018-01-18 20:49:02 Niggas just want foreign shit cuz da next nigga got it, don’t know what type of oil go in dat bitch or nothing lol
1458 2018-01-18 20:49:02 I still like the idea of a match played at Lucas Oil stadium
1459 2018-01-18 20:49:00 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1460 2018-01-18 20:48:54 "There's MORE OIL on 1 ISLAND in the Arctic than The Whole Middle East Combined!" --Whistleblower Pastor who was There when it was discovered in the 70's & the Gov forced them to cover it up!
1461 2018-01-18 20:48:31 Please, who’s cleaning up? The ocean is besieged with plastic and oil pollution. Save our oceans. We’ll all perish without them.
1462 2018-01-18 20:48:28 In connection w/ the Award in Predefined Areas (APA) for 2017 Statoil has been offered interests in 31 exploration licences on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), 17 of these as operator & 14 as a partner #Oil #Norway #statoil
1463 2018-01-18 20:48:25 Yellow pigment. A shade of sun
Lights playful fever run amok.
The briny tidbits cringed, crinkled at fingertips.

A brittle sundering of oil and heat.
The terse sizzle.  A flash.

The metal of the pan sings into the fire.
Breathe savage the skins moist heat.

 Crisp, gold flames
1464 2018-01-18 20:48:20 @FrankBruni I was in the oil business and made aware of the terrible environmental damage, So I  started up an environmental firm which cleaned over 130 sites in New York and New Jersey.  Trump supporters do not realize Trump's  terrible damage to our environment!
1465 2018-01-18 20:48:14 I hate getting my oil changed. And I forgot my headphones.
1466 2018-01-18 20:48:00 Blaming dems for potential shutdown would be like booting all four wheels, tying off the fuel line, and draining the oil, then saying your car won't go because the gas pedal is stuck.
1467 2018-01-18 20:47:56 See what happened to the price of coconut oil when they "discovered" it? Means my Jamaican Black Castor Oil is still safe.
1468 2018-01-18 20:47:52 And those politics are good as hell, unlike you, personally, oil PR flack, wasting your life promoting evil
1469 2018-01-18 20:47:51 They are both pro terrorist so I would call that one dead even!
1470 2018-01-18 20:47:48 man that ss serum sounds AMAZING  What kind skin do you have? I have combination and I'm curious how an oil would work on the oily bits
1471 2018-01-18 20:47:47 the American policy in the middle east is oil for arms Russian the Chinese    UK France are also  selling arms too is all about rising the tension and sell many arms as they can or be poor countries
1472 2018-01-18 20:47:30 Why such enthusiasm abt moving Canadian oil over US soil? Why you're not praising Venezuela oil shipped to the US?
1473 2018-01-18 20:47:23 Possibly though remember some of the builds came due to the hurricanes that forced closures. Tough contract to trade Oil .
1474 2018-01-18 20:47:18 Just got that Vavolinae oil change from Groupon and he didn’t press redeem so I get another oil change free
1475 2018-01-18 20:47:17 WTI Crude Oil -0.1% to 63.93 bbl $USO
Gold -0.9% to 1326.60 oz  $GLD
Copper +0.3% at 3.20 lb $CU
1476 2018-01-18 20:47:12 We need to move off oil. People will suffer and are already suffering from global warming in the US. Think ahead.
1477 2018-01-18 20:47:09 I thought you would have had enough of my oil by now
1478 2018-01-18 20:46:50 I just realized my car will be 21 this year and since we're best buds I'm heading down to the Systembolaget to pick up a few quarts of Akvavit for its next oil change.
1479 2018-01-18 20:46:48 @3HL1045 The weather and humidity effect the oil. Along with how many people are bowling with you. The oil moves and dries up making the ball hook more. When I bowled in high school I would bowl in spots others were to mess their shot up and make them bowl worse.
1480 2018-01-18 20:46:37 Have you tried black olives? Olive oil?
1481 2018-01-18 20:46:33 Thanks Victor. But the challenge is I have to set off quite early for work. So I doubt if I can get oil that early.
1482 2018-01-18 20:46:29 The whole 'modesty' thing with the headscarf is kind of hilarious when you consider she has enough slap on her face to put Ru Paul to shame.
1483 2018-01-18 20:46:25 Oil je la soutient (elle a été con avec Sprite mais xD) 
c'gavé chiant quand tu commence à aimer quelqu'un et ce con il est là mode "ah aufaite ta pote...."
1484 2018-01-18 20:45:55 What about the Iran oil catastrophe happening in the ocean that will affect Aquatic sea life for decades
1485 2018-01-18 20:45:46 Lovely.
1486 2018-01-18 20:45:38 [9:37PM] @TransOceana: Coming to JAKANDE LEKKI from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION  is ok   #TELTrafficReport #TrafficChief
1487 2018-01-18 20:45:18 you did by saying CNRL invested 12.74 billion.  They didn't they bought a companies assets for 12.74 billion.  Its a company investment not a provincial one.  You mentioned one of the biggest oil giants(shell) pulling out of Alberta. Do you see the hypocrisy in that lol.
1488 2018-01-18 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1489 2018-01-18 20:44:53 This isn't good news. Methane is one of the most potent culprits in climate change, and, on top of the oil and gas contributions, tons of methane is being released from the warming sea floor and melting permafrost. Just one of those pesky feedback loops we were warned about.
1490 2018-01-18 20:44:53 Turn on the heat the burnt dust smell will subside AND you won't turn into an adorable ice cube. Put some vanilla essential oil or an orange if you have it (essential oil works too) in your oven to cover the smell. 

It's important to stay warm!
1491 2018-01-18 20:44:51 i just had pasta and used chilli oil if that counts
1492 2018-01-18 20:44:48 Or try coconut oil, it helped me with my hair too!
1493 2018-01-18 20:44:46 I shouldn’t have to top it off. I just changed it 3500 miles ago and it’s not showing that it’s leaking so I must be burning oil
1494 2018-01-18 20:44:36 They didn't try to pretend that things would be fixed in 100 days, that we could get rid of the opioid crisis with a couple of good press conferences and no funding whatsoever. 

In short, they didn't present a snake oil pitch. They presented solutions.
1495 2018-01-18 20:44:35 men vitamins of any sort lol and coconut oils / natural oils like argan oil
1496 2018-01-18 20:44:31 I’m gonna be sad if I ever move far away, not only because of my friends, but also because the guy at the Quickie Lube that always does my oil changes is an angel and always hooks a sista up  #youdarealmvp
1497 2018-01-18 20:44:28 What oil????? 
1498 2018-01-18 20:44:09 Jae Richards’ beard is so beautiful i just want to caress and apply beard oil to it
1499 2018-01-18 20:44:05 Is that garb about modesty and not attracting the opposite Sex lusting after you?
1500 2018-01-18 20:43:58 Probably should definitely check the oil with his dipstick. Heard she squeals a bit too.
1501 2018-01-18 20:43:49 I spent $70 for a fucking oil changed I’m pissed tf off !!!
1502 2018-01-18 20:43:43 @Frank_Giustra love this recipe. But is the DF olive oil on sale generally in Italy? Love to manage to get some here! 
1503 2018-01-18 20:43:41 Of course new capital investment in the oil patch is down.  It's down everywhere.  What's your point?

1511 2018-01-18 20:42:49 Oil products seem to be the only thing helping with my dry skin. Lapho I don’t like oils
1512 2018-01-18 20:42:38 Has City’s & Chelsea’s Oil money actually run out?!
1513 2018-01-18 20:42:38 That’s a great question! The only stuff I’ve found on it was from this gas/oil geologist from AU with a 4 yr degree who is not in environment nor climate. Also an alt-right blog, so I’m going to say it seems like a non-thing, b/c supporting data is from tree rings.
1514 2018-01-18 20:42:26 Oil! Sorry Grease! Plus many more
1515 2018-01-18 20:42:26 @3HL1045 your scores are all over the place because of lane conditions. Oil or not enough oil on the lanes. You’re welcome. #iambowlingnerd
1516 2018-01-18 20:42:25 FUUUUUUUCK. They’re also learning about black castor oil.

1519 2018-01-18 20:41:32 The oil sure has greased our gears, but Sweden is similar with no oil, Finland tge same, and would you look at it Denmark similar and...no oil. It is almost as if oil has nothing to do with it, and a strong socialist (europa not us) state is culpable

1526 2018-01-18 20:40:44 In a related comment, Blackburn hailed the Exxon Valdez's back to basics approach to environmental safety in Alaska. "More oil for all the animals to bathe in," she says.

1529 2018-01-18 20:40:27 Lets Think about that line:
VP- Most likely guilty of obstruction.
SOS - Putins buddy. Oil keeps em in line. Compromised.
SOH - Most Likely being investigated for RICO

Where does the succession path go from there? Senate? Another Cabinet member?
1530 2018-01-18 20:40:24 @jaltucher you’re not the person I thought you were. This is snake oil. 38 emails in 18 days promoting a very unlive live webinar on how to change our lives thru cryptocurrency. It was just an up-sell to more junk. Really disappointed.

1552 2018-01-18 20:37:38 I think so.. I’ve been eating fish, I’m not skipping the oil, eggs... but I was not used to eat that amount of veggies and I’m thinking is probably that. Anyway, my stomach is so swollen and I’m not feeling good in general...not as good as I should, at least.
1553 2018-01-18 20:37:36 I would drop something off for you but the care is in for an oil change !!

1557 2018-01-18 20:37:17 I am seeing upcoming security Pro's being like that makes money so that is what good security is...

It bothers me to see snake oil sales men/women : ) key noting anything other then marketing conferences : )

And a little self guilt for doing it in the past/future : )
1558 2018-01-18 20:37:15 In the past year there's been a growing buzz for CBD, short for "cannabidiol" which is a chemical compound found in marijuana. It comes in a variety of forms, including oil, creams, and capsules. While CBD won't make you high, many people have found that it helps with modera…
1559 2018-01-18 20:37:14 Fascinating. The leaves and flower are also eaten with gusto by Oil beetles (Meloe sp.).

1561 2018-01-18 20:36:59 OIL DIFF: 5.5 -> 5.53
1562 2018-01-18 20:36:50 Ok but what if I turned this into an oil painting?
1563 2018-01-18 20:36:48 Who do oil changes for cheap? on foreigns?
1564 2018-01-18 20:36:40 i remember when i had no traces of a beard(year 10 days) and found out about this beard oil to help speed up the process
1565 2018-01-18 20:36:40 Hopefully we can get more dates for 2018
1566 2018-01-18 20:36:36 you need to moisturise more (avoid oil based) and drink more water (no this is not a myth).
1567 2018-01-18 20:36:33 Hell, if they have no oil and they do not like butter... what do they cook fries with?
1568 2018-01-18 20:36:21 Attention #arthritis sufferers. Do you put #ice on your hands if they hurt from #cooking, #typing, #dialing, using #mouse at night? My doc says warm is better. Do you have a favorite balm #CBD oil or arnica?
1569 2018-01-18 20:36:17 I used to change the oil and filter on my car by myself! Can’t think what possessed me to do that!
1570 2018-01-18 20:35:58 Oil Drizzled Ass
1571 2018-01-18 20:35:40 I can actually smoke in my room today and I have no weed only oil
1572 2018-01-18 20:35:39 For anyone who is totally honest, thinking and is aware of what's going on, 3 elements influenced the global economies most during past 4yrs, 2014~...

1. Monetary policies: FOMC, ECB, BOJ
2. US FRACKING that caused the oil slump (oversupply)
3. China
1573 2018-01-18 20:35:30 Waiting on an oil change and on one side of me is a girl who won’t stop fidgeting and talking on the phone, on the other is a girl chomping HARD on some Chex mix. Send help, this is a form of torture
1574 2018-01-18 20:35:30 Well It doesn’t need the money it has plenty from oil
1575 2018-01-18 20:35:29 Massage them with a warm cloth or oil
1576 2018-01-18 20:35:10 Actually - the more I read this tweet the dafter it gets. Borders don’t apply in the Oil and Gas industry as you clearly admit yourself. *sigh* why is everything so hard
1577 2018-01-18 20:35:07 THIS is why we need the pipeline from Alaska.  If a break happens in the pipes, they shut values and stop the flow and future oil from spilling.  Transport via ship or train car, you can shut it off... It GUSHES OUT until it's empty or gravity stops it. 

Better ways to transport
1578 2018-01-18 20:34:52 [[ he just got a new sketch book and a whole case of oil pastels, markers, an colored pencils. He's talented. ]]
1579 2018-01-18 20:34:52 First thought: @tomlamont about the oil rig?
1580 2018-01-18 20:34:49 Even engine oil it cannot buy
1581 2018-01-18 20:34:48 need to buy some more coconut oil
1582 2018-01-18 20:34:47 Haha, you're absolutely right. This is a simple oil fanboy issue. I just can't like those guys. Just like the sedins. Amazing careers, but got so tired if watching them pick us apart for 10 years.
1583 2018-01-18 20:34:46 Spilled olive oil on my jeans and now it looks like I permanently peed my pants. This...is not ideal.
1584 2018-01-18 20:34:42 I have regular healthy coconut/MCT, Omega,  oil coats my nerve endings to handle EM stressors; Cell phone, WiFi, Psychotronic, Satellite #ti
1585 2018-01-18 20:34:14 What utter rubbish you do spout. For what you say to have a modicum of sense, never mind truth in it, everyone working in oil industry in Aberdeen would need to be from the UK! It is a global industry and the businesses and workers go where the work is, dipstick Scotland!
1586 2018-01-18 20:34:14 When oil money can't buy shit, drop the fkn 12 n settle in #MANCHESTERDerby
1587 2018-01-18 20:34:10 During the winter I actually like to make my own. Shea butter, Castor oil, jojoba oil, glycerin, things like that. When I buy stuff my hair like Ors green hair lotion. Absorbs it right up. My sister likes Manechoice Egyptian collection. I just haven’t found it in Pittsburgh yet.
1588 2018-01-18 20:34:09 #6BGF2018 Talking point. Oil prices have increased 50% in past 7 months while global economy has expanded. Yet correspondingly "human mobility factor" has also expanded with more displeased, dispossessed and disadvantaged migrants looking for safety and security.
1589 2018-01-18 20:34:02 The shredded ones are good as well. I cook them in some coconut oil and their 21 seasoning salute. Just add some peppers and onions 
1590 2018-01-18 20:33:57 This wildgrowth oil omg giving me life.
1591 2018-01-18 20:33:52 The Dotard is selling his snake oil...sad, to many will buy, so sad.
1592 2018-01-18 20:33:51 I joined with 150 of my colleagues today to request that the #Trump Administration reconsider their proposal to open nearly all U.S. federal waters and coastlines to oil and gas drilling.  Their plan threatens marine environments, fisheries, tourism, and overall quality of life.
1593 2018-01-18 20:33:49 Oil & gas will be here for how long? Fish will be here forever if managed sustainably...So tell me now oil is more valuable than our seas and the resources they hold ? You need a RealityCheck!!!!
1594 2018-01-18 20:33:48 Chelsea want Peter Crouch.

Jesus wept.

Is this what Abramovich pumping in over a billion pounds in dodgy Russian oil money was for?

From Llorente to Carroll to Crouch.

Fuck me, Conte has lost it completely.
1595 2018-01-18 20:33:31 I just went to get my oil changed and no I’m forced into spending $150 here and then going to discount tire to get my tire patched  lol on my day off
1596 2018-01-18 20:33:31 Nah you have fun fixing the oil leaks and transmission problems ahah
1597 2018-01-18 20:33:23 The dirtiest oil in North America comes from California (Placerita oil field).
The dirtiest oil in world is Nigerian (Bass oil field). 
The highest cost oil to extract etc.. is Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan. That makes you demonstrably wrong on all points in that tweet #StopKM
1598 2018-01-18 20:33:20 a combination of one or more of the ordinary lactic acid 5%, vitamin c 30% in silicone, azelaic 10%, niacinamide 10% based on your skin type

1601 2018-01-18 20:32:51 Go and get Emergen C! It helps!! I’ve been taking it since Monday for my head cold, my nose has been stuffy beyond belief! If you have a diffuser, get some eucalyptus essential oil, it helps with the stuffy nose too..
1602 2018-01-18 20:32:49 Gonna start dumping a gallon of oil in the ocean every time one of those corny ass CALPIRG guys asks for my money
1603 2018-01-18 20:32:33 When was snake oil better then the actual thing?
1604 2018-01-18 20:32:31 You can buy a 1lt oil refill just to be on the safe side.
1605 2018-01-18 20:32:29 Both those oil majors are great value with oil at current levels, they are super efficient at the moment making profits above $40 a barrel. 6% div yield, P/E ratio of 10-12.

1611 2018-01-18 20:31:42 Have fun with oil leaks and transmission problems
1612 2018-01-18 20:31:34 Quality Fish oil is also important during pregnancy
1613 2018-01-18 20:31:33 Just think of the investment opportunities that has been stolen from us. Investment in people and business in order to generate wealth for all. That might be 1900-1921 but what about 1974-2015 the oil years?
1614 2018-01-18 20:31:32 Statue with castor oil 
1615 2018-01-18 20:31:28 Ran out of ranch dressing when I made my wife salad this morning. Had to improvise for mine. Lemon juice, garlic, fresh ginger, and sesame oil- wonderful.
1616 2018-01-18 20:31:27 Any Mobile Mechanics I Need A Oil Tube For The Dip Stick Put On My Yukon!!! (Need It Done asap) 
1617 2018-01-18 20:31:20 not sure what you mean. I buy blocks of Marseille olive oil soaps; they are very softening to the skin.
1618 2018-01-18 20:31:20 OMG it was so bad pops like we were trying to cook my falafels and they just melted away into the oil hahaha
1619 2018-01-18 20:31:20 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
1620 2018-01-18 20:31:18 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
1621 2018-01-18 20:31:11 Going home to bless/cleanse my new tarot deck and create an essential oil blend attuned to the heart chakra 

1622 2018-01-18 20:31:06 I have always loved your music and liked you as a person. As I was saying when he sign that bill he was not thinking about the Native Americans that depends on that water from cooking to taking baths. And the oil that is going through those pipes is crude oil.
1623 2018-01-18 20:31:05 Oil
Brent crude fell by US7 cents or 0.1% to US$69.31 a barrel. The US Nymex price fell by 2 cents to US$63.95 a barrel.

1624 2018-01-18 20:30:58 Drizzle with oil, and I like to have mine with garlic and lemon. Stick in a 300 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes crispy and starts to brown. :D
1625 2018-01-18 20:30:55 The money a corp/ stocks can make when they're allowed to throw garbage into rivers and oceans and drill for gas/oil near people's homes...when will this trickle down improve income and living std for working class? Smh...
1626 2018-01-18 20:30:49 Neither. 

Pick up a book.
1627 2018-01-18 20:30:38 Nope you have the newfangled oil riches instead. Nobody said our  was honest  But it is generated by the club based on its history and success. Do you even have a Tractor Sponsorship deal? #ProbablyNot #CenturiesBehind
1628 2018-01-18 20:30:27 Bought some Castor oil to put on my eyebrows bc I want them fuller 
1629 2018-01-18 20:30:21 Soothe your brain and body by taking a warm bath with 10 drops of celery seed oil mixed into water! Celery seed has shown to be able to ease muscle tensions, mental stress and anxiety. #healthfact #celeryseed

1634 2018-01-18 20:29:17 I know how to change the oil, i know how to mix the gas 
1635 2018-01-18 20:29:15 Huh? Anyways, "my constituents" are simply my friends in real life: people you people call hill-billies and rednecks-but I call 'em hard workers who actually make things: cattle, oil, refrigerators and railroad locomotives and baseball bats. I will never apologize for that.
1636 2018-01-18 20:29:11 Did u ever used Arnica oil and shampoo? If not just try it
1637 2018-01-18 20:28:41 Just went to the @HomewoodIL @pepboysauto The guy who helped me with a gas cap was awesome. The mechanics were not. was ignored twice by 3 people then told the cost of an oil change would 2x the sale price cuz my car takes "special oil" it doesn't will not be going back.
1638 2018-01-18 20:28:28 Castor oil def work
1639 2018-01-18 20:27:59 Try Shea butter and lemon essential oil as daily moisturiser. And at night before bed, just the lemon oil on the targeted area. Cleared up my hyperpigmentation.

1644 2018-01-18 20:27:07 just read your piece and can fill in the blanks. I taught e.o. chemistry for years and it's time the public knows the truth. It's not the oil but the quality, dose and methodology. DM is you'd like to collab.
1645 2018-01-18 20:27:01  I spot a wee mythic oil in there! amaaaaazing!
1646 2018-01-18 20:26:55 Feeling the need for some sunshine, so substituting and hitting the Tan and Tone oil from @SkinnyTanHQ - smells so good that it’s hard to stop superpup trying to lick it back off!! There’s no warning about that on the bottle!  #fakeittilyoumakeit #tanning

1648 2018-01-18 20:26:40 Just look to the south to Venezuela. Its oil riches should fund a great economy it`s not. Socialism & communism sounds great but history shows power turns it into a fascist dictatorship very quick. So if that want you want, move there & leave our country alone. Support yourself!
1649 2018-01-18 20:26:40 vo é fuma um oil como diz os sábios e ficar suave

1651 2018-01-18 20:26:30 Have you seen the vast expanse of land taken up by the tar sands and oil & gas extraction in Alberta? It is "frigging humongous and far from threatened"... Not to mention the ludicrous quantities of water turned toxic and left to sit in those "responsibly managed" tailing ponds.
1652 2018-01-18 20:26:18 Baby oil got me smelling goooood
1653 2018-01-18 20:26:04 Switching my face moisturizer. Think I’ll try out oil free neutrogena

1662 2018-01-18 20:24:36 We can individually apply ourselves & in some situations have 2 do twice as much 2 get ahead & more than what the privileged have to.

1669 2018-01-18 20:23:20 @realDonaldTrump  I couldn't believe it when I opened my electric bill. Total amount due : 00.  I will say that I paid over $700 for oil for 2 months. $3.09 a gallon! We need to do something about that.  Drill for oil!
1670 2018-01-18 20:22:55 Btw went home and put coconut oil on Snickers. She was so cooperative. Then Tootsie...  Toots was offended!! So Offended!! Lol!!!

1674 2018-01-18 20:22:39 Coraopolis, PA. @realDonaldTrump is there right now, selling his snake oil. A town with a population of around 6K souls, give or take. The HK factory is a primary employer there. This is where he sells. Not Pittsburgh! #Resist & sign #NeedtoImpeach; vote #BlueWave #2018Midterms
1675 2018-01-18 20:22:14 oil spill in the ocean would make a different pattern then a spill in a gulf neither one would be welcome but why tweet about something that might not happen put your staff to work on keeping the federal government open
1676 2018-01-18 20:22:05  my favs today were: “O there’s a sea between us and France.” And “miss why do you keep banging on about trade in oil between countries. My mum just buys it down the garage.” Same S. Year 11. 
1677 2018-01-18 20:22:02 When are we going to put an oil rig in inter coastal water way beside Mar logo?
1678 2018-01-18 20:21:54 Iran is using depleted oil tankers and must be stopped by force from the spill of oil into the oceans
1679 2018-01-18 20:21:50 This mf said coconut oil was for white people. Says the nigga with hands that looks like he punch brick walls for a living. Rough knuckle mf 
1680 2018-01-18 20:21:50 Its a trick question yes? Because they're both massive assholes.....
1681 2018-01-18 20:21:30 Mexico has 2 beautiful coastlines, unlimited growing season and vast oil/gas resources. Yet so many want to leave rather than work to fix their own country. Why are they not staging sit ins at their own Capital constantly?
1682 2018-01-18 20:21:24 I'd eat or with gusto, or a little olive oil if they're out of gusto.
1683 2018-01-18 20:21:18 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, thank you so much for being REAL. Pls do not let our oil & gas companies hijack USA with HI GAS PRICES. They have been allowed to keep home grown oil with OPEC. If is $70 pb overseas, we should not let USA companies do the same to Americans.
1684 2018-01-18 20:21:17 Unless you have stocks and shares invested in Manchester United or subscribe to mutv it should not bother you what they do with their money it's not like it's oil money or sugar daddy money
1685 2018-01-18 20:20:34 It occurs to me that if people like you keep believing the conspiracy theories, the oil companies will be able to make even higher profits by firing all their lobbyists. Who needs lobbyists when there are so many unpaid fanatics willing to push their propaganda for free?
1686 2018-01-18 20:20:25 i fucking swear. my stepdad decided to get his damn oil changed and i have my first day of work in AN HOUR AND TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES

1688 2018-01-18 20:20:10 Personally I’d say evidence can’t support that Fred Koch worshipped Hitler. He built oil refineries for both Hitler and Stalin, playing both sides for a profit. I don’t like the Koch brothers either, but spreading rumors we can’t prove won’t help get rid of them. But yes on nanny

1691 2018-01-18 20:19:44 Midas has a $12 oil change and tire rotation on Groupon! #thankmelater
1692 2018-01-18 20:19:36 Yeah, the one that has oil, gold and diamonds but no money to access their resources...no wonder the control queen is involved.
1693 2018-01-18 20:19:35 AS IF I COULDN'T JUST USE THE £1s WORTH OF COCONUT OIL THAT I BEAT INTO A BODY BUTTAAAAAH. I've been putting mad money in my socks. £20 to a uni student bruv??? thats meals for 3 weeks.
1694 2018-01-18 20:19:29 When you've got oil companies paying, bribing lobbyists etc, they can pretty well swallow up any competition. The second doc. is pretty juicy too. You'll have a lot to say about that one :))

1706 2018-01-18 20:18:16 @BrianBlackUCSF Hello Brian, I am a student from Northwest High school doing a project on Ida Tarbell and how she took over the Standard Oil Company. I was wondering if I could interview you as non traditional research for the project. If you cannot be interviewed that is okay.
1707 2018-01-18 20:18:13 Kraft does make a natural one now. I just despise the regular ones that often add icing sugar, extra palm oil, and lots of salt
1708 2018-01-18 20:18:11 Be lying o, oil baron.
1709 2018-01-18 20:18:03 Thank you; I did a little research, and yeah, the fish oil apparently goes bad within 30 of *opening* the bottle, however many gels are in it. But vitamins have a longer shelf life.
1710 2018-01-18 20:17:42 Agree. That actual card carrying Nazi nanny was hired because she was a Nazi. Fred Koch appeared to worship Hitler, hated FDR. Nanny forced Koch boys to produce a BM on command or be dosed w/ castor oil. Hard to be normal after that
1711 2018-01-18 20:17:36 The collapse of Venezuela production helps to hold oil price... it is so sad news...

1712 2018-01-18 20:17:08 I use coconut oil for straight up lotion and hair masks, because im so dry! I made a tumeric face mask + a tumric tea to drink in the mornings to hopefully clean everything out and avoid getting sick!

1751 2018-01-18 20:12:48 Wow I’m so glad this team was bad.  Definitely need to improve in lots of areas.  That leaking oil.  Well other teams do it as well. Georgia couldn’t get their senior corners to cover a freshman WR.

1753 2018-01-18 20:12:14 @MalcolmNance, I've heard someone posit that Trump and Tillerson want a war to boost Republican prospects this fall and to further increase the price of oil,  respectively.

1785 2018-01-18 20:08:07 @3HL1045 @brentdougherty  Professional bowling has different oil patterns for the lane that they will use each tournament. This makes the bowling ball do different things each tournament. This makes it difficult to bowl strike every time.

1788 2018-01-18 20:07:40 Try Jamaican castor oil. Dark brown bottle at Clicks (or other pharmacies) . Works wonders. 
1789 2018-01-18 20:07:27 But the heavy oil which we sell to the USA is discounted heavily because we are their only customer.  Hurting Big Time.
1790 2018-01-18 20:06:47 I definitely need some castor oil. The one they make in St Lucia actually seems work better for me that the Jamaican variety... butis to get it.
1791 2018-01-18 20:06:37 Would be good for American jobs. I think that's the theory. A lower dollar and higher oil prices.

1802 2018-01-18 20:04:51 Screw cryptos. Can you please help me understand why the price of oil is rising? Where is the demand coming from? Or is it just cheap dollar?
1803 2018-01-18 20:04:50 I kind of doubt we ever had a free market in AB. The presence of the Tapcal Trust Fund from the Lougheed error indicates to me at least the PCs were anti-democratic. PCs subsidized the oil and gas industry. NDPCs do the same.
1804 2018-01-18 20:04:39 As for foreign assistance... how about this agreement.  The day the USA stops interfering in other countries for the sake of oil & weapon sales and to overthrow govt's they don't like, they can stop providing aid. Deal?
1805 2018-01-18 20:04:39 Yay!!! Batter or bowler? I hate that you don't have to oil bats anymore though

1818 2018-01-18 20:02:20 I believe this is the underlying issue of the corruption we're seeing. It's the last gasp of the oil oligarchy and their obscene profits faced with obsolescence.
We recognize that easily with coal. General society is just now seeing it is also true with oil.

1840 2018-01-18 20:00:00 Washing your face more than twice a day or with products that leave your skin feeling tight is not good for your skin. It can cause your skin to overproduce oil to compensate for the dryness caused by over cleansing. #skincare
1841 2018-01-18 19:59:30 Obama who gave us a stimulus program that it didn't stimulate anything, who did not want to expand on our oil reserve explorations it being on land, in the bays or in the oceans but never talked about tax cuts but only kept on raising taxes...Read a book.

1847 2018-01-18 19:57:47 Europe is lost to the muslims thanks to the document signed in 1973 ransoming the oil to get muslims a foothold in Europe
1848 2018-01-18 19:57:47 I dunno if that is true. Look at the sport fishing that takes place around the Gulf oil platforms, aka marlin, tuna, and dolphin magnets. But I was looking forward to fishing near the proposed windmills off Atlantic City for seabass, flounder, and stripers.

1851 2018-01-18 19:57:04 I made someone a natural beard growth oil &  decided to used it to style my hair today. 
1852 2018-01-18 19:56:44 Took me 10 minutes to readjust mine after yesterday’s oil change. Still doesn’t feel quite right

1857 2018-01-18 19:55:48 Not long back from getting a trim at the Barbers. Dude sprayed my hair with Olive Oil once he finished cutting it which I thought was a bit weird 

Gotta say though it actually looks pretty good ... smells delicious

1863 2018-01-18 19:54:41 1) Republicans are the reason marijuana is illegal in TN.

2) This only applies to oil.  Republicans are still as anti-science as they ever were.  

3) Republicans will try to stop this, unless they can find some way to funnel $ to their donors in this bill.
1864 2018-01-18 19:54:29 when the correlation between USD and oil normalize, things will get very interesting in Permian…
1865 2018-01-18 19:54:29 The kindest thing I can say is "it bends the truth". Volstead act was drinking alcohol, fuel alcohol & denatured still available legally (as was drinking alcohol, basically). Oil companies didn't want competition? Understandable, no company does. Had nowt 2 do w/ prohibition tho.
1866 2018-01-18 19:53:51 Charcoal, watercolor, acrylic, oil, ink. By the time I'm done I want to have done every form of art at least once. Twice if I like it.

1868 2018-01-18 19:53:31 There are people who actually dump marinated oil on a plate and dip warm bread in it before eating. It’s damn delicious.
1869 2018-01-18 19:53:25 I just got griped at for touching an oil painting like look old man your wife did it first and I’m here to clean the damn thing anyway

1871 2018-01-18 19:53:10 Leverage. And a Chinese oil tanker that wasn't just carrying oil.
1872 2018-01-18 19:52:53 Fargo is a great town imo. Minot not so much anymore due to the oil boom. Everywhere else I can't vouch for
1873 2018-01-18 19:52:43 I'm in a hot bath full of glorious argan oil bubbles drinking a glass of whisky. This, people, is adulting done right. 
1874 2018-01-18 19:52:31 Again UEFA have confirmed that all the commercial revenues (i.e. deals excluding match day revenues) so that's shirt, stadium etc etc are well below market rates so irrespective of who pays there's no issues - (remember you've recently done deals with Gulf Oil and Saudis Arabia)
1875 2018-01-18 19:52:29 Currently imagining you carrying a flask of pre-mixed Kerrygold butter and Brain Octane oil everywhere you go. It’s amusing.

1880 2018-01-18 19:51:49 Long-term unemployment is on the face, especially the essential oil from rue is used as a kid.
1881 2018-01-18 19:51:40 Might just might go back to the oil fields
1882 2018-01-18 19:51:32 The other night, I marinaded pork chops in soy sauce, olive oil, orange juice, garlic, black pepper, cumin, then pan seared them. Didn't expect the kids to like it, but Baby & Monster ate all of theirs and Bubba went back for seconds, so I'm gonna have to call that one a win.

1890 2018-01-18 19:50:35 Because endless war in the Middle East directly affects his bottom line with Exxon Mobil and contracts with Russian Oil. 
War in middle east equals more contol of price from Russia, which in turn means more profit for Tillerson.
1891 2018-01-18 19:50:26 I wonder how long until she’ll be gone.
1892 2018-01-18 19:50:20 Your advocation and dream for the oil sector has finally come through.

1895 2018-01-18 19:49:34 Yeah, their oil filters are garbage. ;)

1907 2018-01-18 19:47:59 America wants all the Oil and natural resources. America is STILL a war economy. Its 0.001% that control the MIC want perpetual war, and plenty of war profiteers happy to join in with the demagoguery which you see on FOX NEWS that makes you want more war and fascism in the world.

1920 2018-01-18 19:46:38 People, don't be scared into a $300 front brake job during an oil change.  If your brake pads are low, schedule a brake job from a brake place!
1921 2018-01-18 19:46:25 Absolutely
1922 2018-01-18 19:46:21 And take A stroll through your potus’ tweets. Childish by his very example. His reading comprehension and language skills are that if a 14-yr old. Get yourself a clue. He and his cabinet are raping our environment for oil & raiding the treasury as they tear apart our Democracy.
1923 2018-01-18 19:46:20 Like putting garnish on a plate of oil lmao

1931 2018-01-18 19:44:58 Oil were weighed down by a reported rise in U.S. fuel stocks and expectations that OPEC-led efforts to boost prices by cutting output will increase supply from the United States and other rivals.
1932 2018-01-18 19:44:55 the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on petroleum (oil). With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy,

1942 2018-01-18 19:43:10 Royal Dutch Shell and BP are said to have agreed to annual purchase deals of Libyan crude as recovering production levels from the North African nation and decreased security fears began to draw in several of the world's largest oil companies.
1943 2018-01-18 19:43:09 Seasoning is easy. Thin coat of cooking oil and bake at 300/350 for an hour. I purchased almost all of my cast iron from yard sales and thrift shops. They are decades old. Work beautifully.

1959 2018-01-18 19:40:32 On another subject. As we move terrorists out of Syria and Iraq we should work with allies to obtain crude oil or refined products from these countries to reimburse us for lost money and lives. POTUS mentioned this once on campaign trail. Not a crazy idea

1976 2018-01-18 19:39:03 Huffpo. L'Oreal is just marketing to the local customs. Huffpo is making it out to be some global victory for women.
1977 2018-01-18 19:39:02 And...the phony president award is in! Winner all around Donald Trump- faked his leadership shills nothing more than a phony snake oil salesman 
1978 2018-01-18 19:38:49 Break it down in a blender. Cook it on the stove with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. Cauliflower Rice!
1979 2018-01-18 19:38:48 No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizin' a hero
1980 2018-01-18 19:38:29 if anyone wants to come help me take off my oil filter for me, that’s be greatly appreciated 
1981 2018-01-18 19:38:23 I never heard of Nickleback until last summer! 
1982 2018-01-18 19:38:21 I agree, Richard.  US does not control global price of oil at the margin.  You have to be the lowest cost on the Supply Curve.  US Shale is a high cost resource that has only added to the high-end of the supply curve. Shale doesn’t appear to be profitable or CFP below $50 / bbl.
1983 2018-01-18 19:38:15 Whatching impractical jokers while my car is getting an oil change and inspection.... trying so hard not to laugh out loud
1984 2018-01-18 19:38:02 I hope you can teach them to be open minded about new ideas because you guys are not. Stop down grading earthquakes at the oil pumping and gas operations and what about the volcanic activity off the coast you are hiding. Why would you hide something like that. Let me guess MONEY
1985 2018-01-18 19:37:56 Suing big oil and amazon relies on affordable fuel for the shippers , hmmmmmmmm
1986 2018-01-18 19:37:40 mmm how many spoonfuls of warm oil for desert (cake)
1987 2018-01-18 19:37:40 Every man should know how to change a tire and oil
1988 2018-01-18 19:37:38 If you take olive oil, put garlic and onions in there, someone's getting a blowjob.
1989 2018-01-18 19:37:34 WHAT WILL YOUR PASTOR SAY WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT CANNABIS WAS USED IN THE ANOINTING OIL IN THE TEMPLE OF ISRAEL IN THE OLD TESTAMENT?

WILL HE STILL SAY YOU ARE A ORACLE OF SIN THEN?
1990 2018-01-18 19:37:29 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.52
1991 2018-01-18 19:37:28 oil..two concerns as a bear, unleaded making new highs, the daily bearish rsi divergence is gone, the sideways price action, ok thats three things
1992 2018-01-18 19:37:20 we're diffusing lavender oil @ the shop rn & honestly it's the only thing keeping us alive  – bij Flipside Apparel Exchange
1993 2018-01-18 19:37:15 Actually no it wasn’t. I had some random woman message me on Facebook asking if I was interested in being an oil seed rape technician (what ever that is). I will just stick to fixing the cars.
1994 2018-01-18 19:37:05 Exxon Mobil joins the “vultures” devouring our oil resources. 
Probably the reason why the global economic “empire” is forecasting 8.3% growth spearheaded by oil.
1995 2018-01-18 19:37:03 stream will start around 3 today had to get an oil change  and other minor stuff on my car sorry for the delay
1996 2018-01-18 19:37:00 There is a thought out there that $70 is the new $40 meaning the mean price avg for oil.
1997 2018-01-18 19:36:59 I just look oil af. I can't do it.
1998 2018-01-18 19:36:57 So I was watching HLN news or whatever while was getting my oil changed and they were talking about how Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star. She mistakenly said he cheated on her during the time she gave birth to his son “Bannon” and not “Baron”. Shit had me dying 
1999 2018-01-18 19:36:40 if any of u were ever wondering if tea tree oil actually works for acne scars, here is ur sign. bc it does. 
((to me))
2000 2018-01-18 19:36:36 You know, if you fix oil leaks before they get bad, your engine bay won't be a greasy nasty mess also...
2001 2018-01-18 19:36:32 Transitive relations: L’Oréal = Amena, Amena = antisemite, thus L’Oréal = antisemite! Nope, not anothe penny to L’Oréal from this girl, you can bet on that!
2002 2018-01-18 19:36:21 Cant believe u gave kitchen sink 2 1%, omitted oil cleanup funds & layd it on the backs of mc & poor. Cant believ @gop didnt reauthrz CHIP b4 it expird or fix DACA well b4 now. U control evrythng yet u waste it 4 party games screwg w ppl's lives, it is reprehensible. Do ur job!
2003 2018-01-18 19:36:16 Wales has got plenty of that in rainfall  but I guess we could try & grow oats & chestnuts for milk.  Palm oil for margarine might work in Devon ?
2004 2018-01-18 19:36:16 I'm reading pino's meme thing shes doing and i'm so done with her at number 13 oil and matches bc she'd literally get herslf on f ire i hate he r so mu ch
2005 2018-01-18 19:36:15 Then why cite it?  We aren't discussing higher mathematics or the minutia of oil paint composition techniques in Renaissance Italy.  We're discussing the fundamentals of citizenship.

2007 2018-01-18 19:36:13 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2008 2018-01-18 19:36:07 I know it is an ugly eyesore to travel & see Oil Pump Jacks spreading across thousands of acres next to cattle  & horses.  It is a blight on America.  Greed when ZERO SUM Electro Magnetic Energy is Available ..

2011 2018-01-18 19:35:37 Oil powers meeting; Stocks winning streak; NATO summit -
2012 2018-01-18 19:35:20 West Texas will get an oil boom soon like right now #Speakingitintoexistence
2013 2018-01-18 19:35:08 I would believe it is you for your divisiveness. But enjoy your 1st amendment, I am.
2014 2018-01-18 19:34:47 You said big oil bought out the alternatives, now you say they are being developed. Which one is it? And why is it always so far in the future to make it hard to prove it will actually happen? BTW: 2030 no gasoline cars in Germany is a proposal, not law. I doubt it will happen.
2015 2018-01-18 19:34:45 Back at @CBAAlberta for an amazing talk by Carolyn Wright about Oil & Gas for the Young Lawyers South section.
2016 2018-01-18 19:34:38 Stock Market up, unemployment down, minority unemployment down, border crossing down, wall going up, Obamacare done, Dodge coming back to Detroit hiring 2400 people, Apple bring back $350Bil hiring upwards of 50,000 people. Oil, Gas and coal back Wow what a fake president he is.
2017 2018-01-18 19:34:38 Fourth trend is about #oil price. Anything could happen in the next year. We are moving into a time of relative oil price stability. $55-60USD WTI price. It is a good price for Alberta. Producers are to keep eye on cost containment.
2018 2018-01-18 19:34:37 I have been at the dealership since 1 for an oil change its almost 3 o’clock im so over this
2019 2018-01-18 19:34:15 Love you be a total moron and block my own sink with coconut oil this is so much fun you guys.
2020 2018-01-18 19:34:01 Shouldn’t a a qb and his coach be on the same page and have like minds? Gotta make sure they blend. Can’t have oil and water
2021 2018-01-18 19:33:52 Which brand do you use? I’ve just been sporting an oil slick lol
2022 2018-01-18 19:33:48 Yeah it’s incredibly off putting even as a vegan. Like I follow a plant based recipes page and they’re the WORST. They’re rude if you post ANYTHING “unhealthy” including if you cook with oil. Most strictly vegan pages are the same. The two I mentioned I’ve been able to stand.
2023 2018-01-18 19:33:47 Lmao trying to grow my natural lashes and put castor oil on them & now my lashes hurt when I blink

2027 2018-01-18 19:33:34 Brian Steed, who runs @BLMNational for @SecretaryZinke brags to @NatResources about the oil and gas safeguards they’ve eliminated, like safety regs on fracking wells and cutting natural gas leaks on #publiclands
2028 2018-01-18 19:33:15 Hah! Remember as a child going to Southport & bathers coming out of the water covered in oil.
2029 2018-01-18 19:33:14 I even make my own scrub with olive oil and kosher salt.
2030 2018-01-18 19:33:06 CBD oil came today :) yay
2031 2018-01-18 19:33:04 like I said yesterday... Twitter moves faster than mineral oil through a cow
2032 2018-01-18 19:33:02 Did You Know...
Cabin Air Filters are used to filter the dust and debris that enters the cabin of your vehicle. They are inspected at each oil change as they can fill with debris very quickly depending on the road conditions.
2033 2018-01-18 19:32:57 Today has been such a good day. Woke up at 6 took myself to breakfast, sat next to the ocean, prepared for my tour, got my oil changed, now I'm eating bruschetta and drinking a vodka lemonade #blessed #everclear #flprosurfcomp

2040 2018-01-18 19:32:22 The USGS is hiding earthquakes in California down grading earthquakes near oil and gas pumping operation and volcanoes eruption off the West Coast. They also say earthquakes can not be forecasted. They can be forecasted and Dutchsinse has a 90% success rate. Please help.

2043 2018-01-18 19:31:55 You need to match that data point to seasonality , in that respect its nothing out of the ordinary but actually normal, hence why oil came off the day's lows . All the best
2044 2018-01-18 19:31:43 yall really be wearing wigs, making niggas oil ya slave braids when u take it off smh love yourselves kings

2050 2018-01-18 19:31:08 So happy with the rose hip oil ive been using from the ordinary @theordinary
2051 2018-01-18 19:31:07 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
2052 2018-01-18 19:31:06 Why is reshape oil so hard to buy in the UK?
2053 2018-01-18 19:31:02 I'd never take lessons from someone younger than me with less achieved and kinda famous flashing around 3 thousand dollars for an entire year as if she struck oil. Moron.
2054 2018-01-18 19:31:00 Realistically, they will raise far less. So much risk here (legal, political, etc.) that they would issue and trade at a deep discount to a barrel of oil.
2055 2018-01-18 19:30:56 Coconut oil for your skin. It'll make it shine! But it might give you pimples too.
2056 2018-01-18 19:30:55 Can’t wait to get this oil change tomorrow, gotta take care of my baby

It will reopen at 1 p.m. that day ahead of our game against the Edmonton Oil Kings.
2059 2018-01-18 19:30:20 Why are you using tea tree oil and not chemicals pls

2063 2018-01-18 19:30:11 อยากลองใช้ oil ของ three มาก แต่ราคา...เกินจะรับไหววว
2064 2018-01-18 19:29:57 You should give it a Viking funeral to honour its service. 
But you can only use a tablespoon of oil

2067 2018-01-18 19:29:42 I wish I can believe that but with a snake oil salesman like hahn I lost trust in him. It was a slap in the face when they hired Renteria and traded away Quintana and Sale. I'd rather be a disgruntled six fan till Jerry wakes up and does right for the sox fans.
2068 2018-01-18 19:29:41 Oh I hate natural skincare! It's a dry oil with salicylic acid, so not as heavy or "oily" as a standard oil, it reminds me of a serum? I used it last night and all the little hormonal whiteheads are gone. Use it all over!
2069 2018-01-18 19:29:12 Stop adding all the forks together. There is only $BTC and all else are bullshit, except $BCH, that's just pure unadulterated vile snake oil.
2070 2018-01-18 19:28:59 Newark NJ made the list.... you should be disappointed. Keep drilling though, oil will come back eventually!
2071 2018-01-18 19:28:45 I also don't use special soap for cast iron.  I use minimal soap and water and then heat the cast iron on the stove to fully dry it.  If it starts losing its patina, then I liberally coat it with oil and heat it to "bake" the oil on.

2075 2018-01-18 19:28:12 They're already sending us a lot less oil than they used to.  They have other customers.
2076 2018-01-18 19:28:12 Why does my car use the expensive oil? Like, I’m just trying to be cheap but can’t. Smh.
2077 2018-01-18 19:28:06 Noot is a snake oil salesman. Cares only about himself.
2078 2018-01-18 19:27:58 I work with oil, grease, grime, dust, dirt and saw dust one of the resons I don’t own anything white I have to shower after working everyday
2079 2018-01-18 19:27:58 is it more of a problem area thing or all over the face thing? ive been using tea tree oil on my hormonal breakouts and its not working fast enough 
2080 2018-01-18 19:27:53 I've committed to having the year of my dreams!!! Burning the midnight oil tonight
2081 2018-01-18 19:27:45 Why does coconut oil have to taste so vile
2082 2018-01-18 19:27:40 Bake florets in the oven with salt pepper olive oil garlic powder and grated parmigiano reggiano cheese. They will caramelize and you’ll actually like them.
2083 2018-01-18 19:27:40 Why has he not imposed the new sanctions or spoke out about Russia giving N Korea oil? We all know why.

2092 2018-01-18 19:25:39 This so called doctor could be compared to the early 1800s horse driven wagon west roaming town to town doctors selling snake oil to the people. A modern day hack, that CNN loves to use to fit a narrative. What a JOKE ....

2094 2018-01-18 19:25:31 You are.
2095 2018-01-18 19:25:22 I vouch for pure coconut oil. I use it to remove make up, to moisturise the skin and to cook 
2096 2018-01-18 19:25:21 I remember using something like this ... in the house during power cuts, but in the stables for feeding animals.. actually , can see myself watching goats being born by the light of one... oil memories... something tho
2097 2018-01-18 19:25:19 Clear example showing that the oil industry cannot be trusted to comply with safety and environmental protection rules. They appear to have put profits/ cost ahead of safety. Yes, independent monitors need to be on board to ensure compliance.
2098 2018-01-18 19:25:04 Oooohhh mental health concerns!??? What about there mental health of the people you preyed on! Let’s worry about you, the child molester and sexual assaulting piece of s@!t that you are! Hope you get the wonder bread bag treatment with no olive oil!

2101 2018-01-18 19:24:45 i just can't stop guzzling delicious oil
2102 2018-01-18 19:24:35 ｢OIL｣を3つ書いてピリオドを付けると｢サザエさんの終わりの歌｣っぽく聞こえる #トリビア
2103 2018-01-18 19:24:06 I’ll stick with “never.” Oil demand will be on a steady decline, I predict, well before any rigs make economic sense. Profits will be declining with that drop in demand, so these high-cost locales are simply not going to be exploited. Or so I’m going to guess.
2104 2018-01-18 19:23:40 Appreciate the struggle and be ready for your breakthrough. 

Stop complaining and start being proactive to receive what God has in store for u.

Oil ya hair, brush ya tongue, and tone your skin.

Stop cursing so much and start thinking before you speak. 

Find YOU and LOVE YOU.
2105 2018-01-18 19:23:33 I’m ran out of castor oil got a scrape of Shea butter left it’s time for this snow to go on melt
2106 2018-01-18 19:23:30 Wait...so one of the heads of the largest private lobbies in the world other than Israel Inc. (and bankers), happens to be Big Oil, and declared the only way to keep a self-funding corporation like U.S. Inc. afloat...is to beat up the slow kid at school? #ExxonIrony
2107 2018-01-18 19:23:22 Ross can you assure Aberdeen’s oil workers that they’ll be able to move freely around Europe without the cost & hassle of multiple visa applications?
2108 2018-01-18 19:23:19 I use a pizza pan with holes. I'll try less oil time
2109 2018-01-18 19:23:16 No wonder you smell like chicken cheese dipped in coconut oil headass
2110 2018-01-18 19:22:43 you can always tell the crude oil from oil that’s been to a refinery by their table manners
2111 2018-01-18 19:22:42 @VWUKHelp Have a 3 year old VW Golf R, 15k miles. 1 dealer said Haldex oil needs changing on 3rd service. 1 other says on 5th service. 1 other says at 40k miles. What is the correct time to change it?
2112 2018-01-18 19:22:36 can argue that the fed should look through any one time shock (// with oil) but not sure that is how fed would view it

(p.s. I generally agree with you that monetary policy shouldn't respond to depreciation, US has no obligation to keep USD stable to help out its creditors!)
2113 2018-01-18 19:22:36 I must just give up the outdoors :) or learn to wear shirts with collars when I do venture out. Can't find aftersun lotion either :( any alternatives? Will tissue oil work?
2114 2018-01-18 19:22:32 my windshield is cracked, just like my heart. my tires are all flat, just like my brain. my engine is running rough, just like my soul. i don’t know how much further we can go burning this much oil.
2115 2018-01-18 19:22:24 I like Bush more now, but do not forget he orchestrated a serious lie to have excuse to invade Iraq & destroyed it's infrastructure, everything but oil ministry, leaving it vulnerable for Terrorists to move in, he got off easy >Bush family is oil family long before politics

Stop killing people of color

We don't need oil pipelines we need clean water
Save the bees 
2119 2018-01-18 19:21:55 You were the one so certain of man’s scientific mastery: I was pointing out how limited it is. Glad you agree. But rely on the free market? It will choose short term profit over our planet’s health every time. And it sure hasn’t invented itself out of costly oil spills yet.
2120 2018-01-18 19:21:37 RAVINTSARA essential oil is ideal oil to use when there are coughs, colds, influenza and other respiratory ailments such as asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis and otitis. It acts as a tonic when one is lethargic or congested with white or clear catarrah.

2131 2018-01-18 19:20:27 Renewables like wind, solar, and wave can do the job just as well and at cheaper costs than either oil or gas today even when paired with storage requirements. The sunshine state should be making the change. 

The change is coming whether you like it or not. Try keeping uo.
2132 2018-01-18 19:20:27 Praying that this oil change doesn’t take ten years

2134 2018-01-18 19:19:46 They love the oil, they love the gold, but they hate the immigrants, that's called Evil..Satan..You will be punished, unless God does not exist like you say. The Most High does Exist, like Lucifer is real. Since the Earth is under Lucifer control, they want to kill God people.

2142 2018-01-18 19:18:42 oil well
2143 2018-01-18 19:18:30 I'm like my bad I didn't wanna assume.......

When I knew that bringing up getting an oil change from someone else would make him tell me no so he could do it lmao
2144 2018-01-18 19:18:22 A Nissan dealer would probably want to force regenerate the DPF. New oil etc. Sometimes works. Sometimes not. And not cheap. A new one is eye-watering. If a long blast isn't clearing it I'd try a DPF cleaner. Nothing really to lose.
2145 2018-01-18 19:18:20 Come to #louisiana if you have any reservations about how bad BP oil spill really was. It had a ripple effect of negativity way beyond environmental catastrophe through the entire sate economy. #ThursdayThoughts
2146 2018-01-18 19:18:20 @scarletfu @JChatterleyBBG Expect price of crude oil to rise in the next 2 yrs back to $100/b. creating an expansion of current account deficit forcing the surplus current account countries to buy increased amount of safe assets; long term U.S. Government debt i.e. long bonds.
2147 2018-01-18 19:18:19 can someone teach me how to change the oil in my car so I don't have to keep paying men to do it for me?
2148 2018-01-18 19:18:15 She must have cheaped out and went to one of these celeb home parties where they used motor oil instead of restylane.

2151 2018-01-18 19:17:39 Anyone ever got their oil changed and NOT had them try to convince you that another $600 of work is needed or your car will completely fall apart within 48 hours?
2152 2018-01-18 19:17:32 He was like "ay boo why you gonna pay for an oil change when you got me"
2153 2018-01-18 19:17:17 Lol, the irony of Martin Keown calling Sanchez a mercenary for choosing United over City - a club full of mercenaries from manager to players only there for the oil money from human rights abusers

2208 2018-01-18 19:09:27 Hillary is pro-fracking.
She yelled at a Green Peace activist in the face during the primaries.
She took twice as much money from Big Oil than Trump did.
Said environmentalists need to "get a life."
Hillary is no friend to the environment and you're a liar if you say otherwise.
2209 2018-01-18 19:09:14 it's hard to stand with US allies in Syria that want to split the country and steal oil to themself

2227 2018-01-18 19:07:24 I like oil because it doesn't dry fast so you can't  really make any mistakes but it does take forever to dry which is a downside

2259 2018-01-18 19:03:25 Each state has its own mineral base..for ex.. Andhra has more oil and natural gas but gujarat is using it. Apart from it, andhra is rich in barytes, marbles, manganese..etc
2260 2018-01-18 19:02:58 I need to purchase an oil diffuser ASAP
2261 2018-01-18 19:02:58 "Tell smallie I workin in de oil,

2262 2018-01-18 19:02:33 When you spend $50 at @SallyBeauty and wait in line for 20 mins to checkout and end up w/ oil all over the stuff you just bought <<<<<

- researching what base makes the perfect gazpacho chowder
2264 2018-01-18 19:02:14 Comparing huge data to oil, and “extracting value” seems a curious comparison to make given the world we live in. #enigma2018
2265 2018-01-18 19:02:10 He spanked em. I don't know why Mitch McConnell keeps sending Lynsey Graham or Jeff Flake to do a Republicans job.
2266 2018-01-18 19:02:07 The Clarins Instant Light Lip Comfort Oil. I own and like the Nuxe Rêve de Miel (my fav), Jack Black balm, EOS, Glossier Balm Dotcom, Sara Happ lip slip, Bite Agave mask, Milani moisture oil, and Nivea moisture. Plus more I'm probably forgetting right now.
2267 2018-01-18 19:02:04 I use tea tree after washing my face and I moisturise but thats because I have dry skin but tea tree stuff will be good for oil skin
2268 2018-01-18 19:02:03 Read my articles more carefully - I said a 40pc oil price increase since last summer, not a year ago.
2269 2018-01-18 19:02:01 :^)
2270 2018-01-18 19:01:31 @DeptofDefense Even the gop will agree...since Exxon will take over most of the oil supply.

2273 2018-01-18 19:01:26 Mind you ... You could use the electricity to electrolyse seawater & make Hydrogen. You could then pump the Hydrogen into tanks in the the jacket (supporting structure) legs.  You could repurpose the pipe that used to carry oil/gas to shore to carry the H2 when needed.  Cool :-)
2274 2018-01-18 19:01:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet powerful politicians.
2275 2018-01-18 19:01:06 Poured hot oil all over my hand.. well done Grace 
2276 2018-01-18 19:01:02 @AmityUground yet Tony Blair said the cash from oil reserves would be held in trust for the Iraqi people. #bullshit

2285 2018-01-18 19:00:07 I thought you had a report or study or something written by Neera that advocated taking oil from Libya. But you just have an email asking a question. You are being extremely disingenuous.
2286 2018-01-18 19:00:06 Drink more motor oil.
2287 2018-01-18 19:00:06 1/2 tab of Gerin Oil and 1/2 tab of Aslan
2288 2018-01-18 19:00:04 No he's representing the real estate industry and the oil and gas industry and anyone who think he's doing a great job probably didn't vote for him.
2289 2018-01-18 18:59:38 Wish there was more brands that made folio options.. some of us only have cases to protect the screen from skin oil. 
2290 2018-01-18 18:59:33 So desperate are the left/Libs to create a non-existent "moderate Muslim" that they will ignore any red flag. 
Her tweet reflects what the majority of Muslims are: peddlers of Victimhood who enable violent jihadists.
2291 2018-01-18 18:59:31 It's not a bipartisan bill either. Lynsey Graham and his RINO squad bent over and assumed the position for Dirty Dick Durban. They couldn't negotiate there way out of a wet paper bag. That's why you didn't see Sen Cotton or a more representative Rep. as a member of the gang of 6
2292 2018-01-18 18:59:30 Great. I can't buy a vest to hide my iPad, now I can't color my hair.
2293 2018-01-18 18:59:22 Either (1) early stage exploration is not eligible to be funded but other stages of exploration are OR (2) exploration is 'probably' not permitted.  Either way, upstream oil and gas development is still permitted so EIB is behind World Bank and leadership of EIB/EBRD is needed.
2294 2018-01-18 18:59:00 That’s why many of us are calling for RICO racketeering charges against the cabal of oil companies who have successfully conspired for decades to knowingly wreck the climate and cover up the facts.
2295 2018-01-18 18:58:57 When cooking with olive oil make sure heat remains medium to low. If it becomes to hot it loses its nutritional value and becomes toxic. 

#TxLastDiet #FoodTips
2296 2018-01-18 18:58:56 You literally just said that one is "inferior" to the other and that one is "garbage". They are different products and heavy oil is not garbage it is absolutely necessary to the functioning of our economy.
2297 2018-01-18 18:58:45 Oil white TV if u were a girl lol
2298 2018-01-18 18:58:39 fish oil pills are so big jesus
2299 2018-01-18 18:58:37 Think the woman who performed a ‘spontaneous’ test on my liquids at the airport low-key wanted to find a new eye cream.
No Karen, you won’t find palm oil in there.
2300 2018-01-18 18:58:35 The middle east has the most ridiculous laws but no sanctions whatsoever for the oil rich countries in that region,shady as hell
2301 2018-01-18 18:58:33 Good to know! I happened upon an oil recycling bin at the back of restaurant near my home and put our used frying oil in it. (I was so happy to find it!) 
Bacon fat can be saved and stored in the fridge and used in lieu of butter or lard to bake with.

2303 2018-01-18 18:58:22 Actually, looking at the map, the purpose is also about oil and gas. Assad's departure -irrelvant to the plight of the people- is to clear the way for pipelines to the Mediterranean and reduce dependence on Strait of Hormuz!
2304 2018-01-18 18:58:02 my nose oil is my new glossy highlight
2305 2018-01-18 18:57:41 Cooking Tip: If you mix a little coconut oil with freshly steamed Kale it makes it much easier to scrape into the bin.
2306 2018-01-18 18:57:39 Is this how oil companies operate? Cmon, Rex.
2307 2018-01-18 18:57:31 might as well start putting castor oil on this joint
2308 2018-01-18 18:57:31 Why no love for Venango Co??? I watch you every morning, waiting for you to say either Franklin or Oil City. Lol!
2309 2018-01-18 18:57:29 Actually it's more than oil.  It was a rhetorical question.   Legally America has zero business in Syria.  They are invaders, same as in all the other countries.  Only Russia was asked to assist by Syria.
2310 2018-01-18 18:57:24 Every time I come for an oil change they wanna say I need a change on every little thing they find like nah nigha.... I came in for one thing and one thing only. “But But But” But nothing
2311 2018-01-18 18:57:10 You need deep oil to fry the big fish
2312 2018-01-18 18:57:09 Are you eating rick simpson oil also?  You should be if you are not!  Helps with nausea and will also help kill your cancer, hang in there buddy.  Also there are certain mushrooms that can help.  Stay blessed Ched

2314 2018-01-18 18:56:58 That negates the facts that CO2 and methane are released at every step from extraction to refining. What a lame argument. It also ignores the toxic footprint of the fracking oil companies do.
2315 2018-01-18 18:56:46 No natural gas, no clean power, New England still burning coal and oil,,cough cough, capacity maxed out, inexpensive gas 200 miles away. LNG carrier delivering gas to Boston this week, FROM RUSSIA,how crazy is that?
2316 2018-01-18 18:56:44 Plenty of oil for power plants in Venezuela.
2317 2018-01-18 18:56:31 Cyber canada sits on the biggest oil reserve there is in the world i believe

2319 2018-01-18 18:56:20 @WatergateHotel hey! Really random question… there was a BEAUTIFUL fragrance in the gym/pool area; an essential oil I assume but I couldn’t place it… any clues appreciated x
2320 2018-01-18 18:56:16 Coconut oil
2321 2018-01-18 18:56:05 300 and enough oil on the underside that I could drive it through a salt mine (or auburn, AL heyooo) and be fine
2322 2018-01-18 18:55:45 @emmasturgess Hi Emma, sent an email invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster but not sure if it reached you. Hence I am following and wondered if you can make it? I can resend invite  tx @luisawelch

2324 2018-01-18 18:55:40 Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil just a FYI.
2325 2018-01-18 18:55:34 Yeah recycling is cool but have you tried dismantling the oil cartels?
2326 2018-01-18 18:55:28 Snake oil salesman blocked me when I asked why he wouldn’t open his church to people after the hurricane
2327 2018-01-18 18:55:15 i wish they would listen to me and take the damn ghee lol tryna fix the flu with castor oil 
2328 2018-01-18 18:55:08 Too late. Avocado, olive oil drizzle, lemon juice w/ cayenne pepper, salt and some red pepper

2333 2018-01-18 18:54:12 @lickedspoon Hi Deborah sent an email re Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo rest. Westminster. Was wondering if you received it & if you can make it? thank you.  @luisawelch
2334 2018-01-18 18:54:11 It's over 100y old. It's oil on wooden board which is much better than canvas. That can deteriorate/go brittle/split where the canvas is stretched over the stretcher bars. Get ugly creases .
2335 2018-01-18 18:54:07 Definitely L'oreal! Their choice of model and their cause were both wrong.
2336 2018-01-18 18:54:07 Thank fucking everything for homemade cannabis coconut oil and oxys. My god. I almost feel something besides pain now.
2337 2018-01-18 18:53:59 Shout out to @bradwilliams09 for redonating the free oil change! Much appreciated!!

2340 2018-01-18 18:53:21 As women in Iran tear off their oppressive head wear, L’Oréal , a cosmetics company that still allegedly tests on animals in China decide it would be cool to run this in adverts?
2341 2018-01-18 18:53:20 THAT SAME EMITTED PLANT LIFE CARBON NO DIFFERENT THEN THE OIL FOSSIL FUEL CARBON IS FOOD FOR THE PLANTATION ALL THE SAME. THOUGH WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE TREES & IS RE-EMITTED AFTER BEING CONSUMED IT BECOMES ALL THE MORE SO NOURISHING

WITH THAT SAID YOU WANNA STOP GLOBAL WARMING
2342 2018-01-18 18:53:14 Still!! Did I say I am bothered.. Get u bio oil and stop defending trash 
2343 2018-01-18 18:53:09 Yes! Love them. The trick is to salt & drain the cucumber & radish beforehand so they don’t make the salad watery. Dressing is simple soy/rice vinegar/oil w/ a little ginger & honey. Easy peasy 
2344 2018-01-18 18:53:02 Really? #vegan? Marketing ploy or true intent to proffer Animal Sentience, the foundation of veganism? "sustainable Palm Oil" a marketing misnomer.

2348 2018-01-18 18:51:58 that would be all corporations btw not just oil companies

2351 2018-01-18 18:51:47 Yes, you need to burn everything with fire before you put anything on it that grill. And make sure it’s not a rusty mess. Bring your can of spray oil.
2352 2018-01-18 18:51:44 The irony of a City fan who’s clubs built on arab oil and state funding chirping about money. Severe lack of intelligence with this lot.

2357 2018-01-18 18:51:26 AS THE TREES WILL CONSUME CARBON EMITTED FROM THE OIL FOSSIL FUELS FROM CARS, FACTORIES, BOATS & TRUCK EXHAUSTS. AS WELL AS CONSUME THE CARBON EMITTED FROM OTHER PLANTATION.

AT NIGHT WHEN PHOTOSYNTHESIS ISN'T ABLE TO OCCUR CAUSE THE SUNS DOWN THE TREES EMIT CARBON. NOT OXYGEN
2358 2018-01-18 18:51:13 Does castor oil really help with natural hair growth? #GirlTalkZA
2359 2018-01-18 18:51:06 Who’s ‘they’ it’s a fact bank rate are only used on essential goods like flour milk oil sugar n some types of medication not on everything
2360 2018-01-18 18:50:59 I've also used argan oil to help with scarring. I can't even see the spot where I busted my knee a few years ago.
2361 2018-01-18 18:50:56 I decided it would be a good idea to mix castor oil in w my toning conditioner 3 hours before class. I hope I’m not an idiot..
2362 2018-01-18 18:50:24 What does this assume about other systemic factors/forces?  Does it assume all things being equal to today’s mix of energy system contributors. If electric, wind, solar battery accelerate and disrupt oil and coal during this period, is the curve relationship mitigated?

2368 2018-01-18 18:49:35 So often I teach a student who says they think they sound awful &have lost the joy of singing. then we work&oil things &have fun &they sound fabulous. And I say: ‘You have a beautiful voice!’, because they do&I wish they realised it! And they light up with a smile.

2369 2018-01-18 18:49:35 Whatever you do don't mention that Norway holds the world largest sovereign wealth fund that all Norwegians have a stake in. Found oil at
2370 2018-01-18 18:49:33 Dallas is probably a nice city but yeah I can’t imagine any self respecting company locating itself in any part of Texas. Do you think the oil companies would be there if they didn’t have a choice? What a worthless state.
2371 2018-01-18 18:49:22 That’s right man! Your blood is gold as extravergin olive oil! My nonna  would be proud of you. Now to reward you I’ll tell you another typical Italian dish that you don’t know (probably)

2383 2018-01-18 18:47:52 I didn't see Prescott listed here but he and others like the Rockerfellers (standard oil) sure did supply a lot to the Germans and other Axis forces during both WWs. That M.O. has been in place for a long time.

2397 2018-01-18 18:46:39 A9a: Huge! The acceptance and foreign attention the Nigerian solar space is receiving can only propel the industry higher so much so that solar becomes the new "OIL" – especially with most economies having a deadline date for fossil fuels use. #GridlessAfrica
2398 2018-01-18 18:46:34 That's just ridiculous can't wait till April. All the oil money in the world and certain breeding operations can't boast such potential talent
2399 2018-01-18 18:46:33 Try, APL medicated ,coconut oil , castor oil and sta-sof-fro with red cap.. you will give me a feedback! Been using it for years..
2400 2018-01-18 18:46:30 Best thing about oil is that you don’t need to constantly apply more, just a dab is fine

2409 2018-01-18 18:45:41 The guy that sold me my car at the dealership told me whenever i go for my oil changes to go see him and he’ll give me money or fill up my tank, and i need an oil change soon 
2410 2018-01-18 18:45:30 No there isnt just oil to keep it moist

2423 2018-01-18 18:44:16 I miss the days when me and my brothers would just dab a qtr of oil a day 
2424 2018-01-18 18:44:07 Fossil fuels are NOT the future of the economy. @SecretaryZinke we should NOT be pursuing offshore drilling in ANY coastal state. How about putting money toward funding offshore wind farms? How about that???? #Oil #environment
2425 2018-01-18 18:44:00 These cast of characters have financial ties to the regime and to big major oil companies like ploughshares. Unfortunately, they've cultivated many Americans on the left to support the unreformable reformers.
2426 2018-01-18 18:43:59 That's a good idea! I've been buying bulk epsom salt and putting drops of essential oil in the bath but this would save a lot of steps!! Thanks!

2482 2018-01-18 18:37:31 Smart people. Meanwhile, they use cell phones and vehicles and any other assortment of items that use oil and gas. I guess that dictator oil is better than Canadian, and tanker spills in oceans are better than pipelines with shutoff valves. People don't think.

2515 2018-01-18 18:34:21 NorthCape was carrying over 94,000 barrels of oil. During the recent cold snap,  (2 weeks) over 2 MILLION barrels of oil (Over 20 Barges worth)was burned for Power Generation in New England, as Natural gas was at maximum pipeline capacity. Increase Gas Pipeline capacity ASAP,
2516 2018-01-18 18:34:12 This one is about 50 from me but it's worth it! He once did a oil change for me at 630 in the morning because it was the only time either one of us had to do! (Ya I seldom do my own oil changes)
2517 2018-01-18 18:33:59 I guess it takes over an hour and a half for an oil change at GMC with an appointment
2518 2018-01-18 18:33:53 What about the argument that oil companies don’t burn the oil and therefore aren’t liable? Prof Frank @UCDavisLaw says that @SCOTUS in 2007 said that “If it is a substantial contributor, its product, that can result in liability or being subject to regulation.”

2521 2018-01-18 18:33:36 XLE is basically following oil. From a short term perspective (i.e. a few days), odds are it goes down. But from a short-medium term perspective, I think it'll make a bearish divergence before it makes a correction
2522 2018-01-18 18:33:22 I'm good with that.
A 5 minute PP and a shortened Oil bench every game is a nice advantage :)
2523 2018-01-18 18:33:15 Más incluso que la Standard Oil GM o Sony, increíble. ¿Todo fue debido a la vorágine de los tulipanes?
2524 2018-01-18 18:32:58 And about oil production: Sweden imports wood logs beside the fact they have thousands of acres of finest woods. You get the point.

2532 2018-01-18 18:31:51 Keown is a Twat. Even Wenger said Sanchez will always be welcome and spoke highly of him. Even shut up the media who moaned how much UTD spend. He said he respects UTD because they use there own money the club generates, no oil money

2535 2018-01-18 18:31:44 Big Oil CEO then Secretary of State. Tillerson is a prime example of how the Deep State operates. The confluence of powerful interests inside government and in the corporate world.
2536 2018-01-18 18:31:41 I do. I love their C Firma. I prefer lactic acid as my AHA, so their TLC is a bit too intense for me. But people love it. I’d skip their oil & get The Ordinary’s Marula. Same thing, much less expensive. I love their sunscreens too

rocky: ... you were getting a hot oil massage
2541 2018-01-18 18:31:12 Oops sorry about  the CAPS, didn't mean THAT

Me : attitude of em bro
2543 2018-01-18 18:30:56 Lunch today was some nice lentils, fresh tomato, chopped avocado, good Parmesan and olive oil and sea salt. 
2544 2018-01-18 18:30:37 Why is there complete SILENCE of the Continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa. Is oil for Britain more important than life?. REFERENDUM is the only SOLUTION.
2545 2018-01-18 18:30:31 I've gotten to where I don't allow my guilty feelings about maybe being a hypocrite keep me from teaching/telling what is right.  No one is perfect.  The problem is when you stop trying.

Maybe that's what bothers you ... you feel these snake oil salespeeps don't try?

2550 2018-01-18 18:30:12 Oh, this is great reading. It’s going to be much better than I thought. I only wish oil companies would immediately shut down all deliveries to the city. It’s what the lawsuit is about, right. Might look good to the judges: cooperate before the verdict.
2551 2018-01-18 18:30:06 Which one??? 

Oil - 3500
Balm - 2000
2552 2018-01-18 18:30:03 One of you food writers recommended a chilli oil recipe in I think a friend’s new cookbook, a few months ago.  I only remember that you cook garlic and fresh chillis. Anyone?
2553 2018-01-18 18:30:00 #Cocoa butter sounds delish but it isn’t just for eating! Its scent and smoothness is ideal in manufacturing a variety of goods such as cosmetics, tanning oil, soap and lotions too! #funfact
2554 2018-01-18 18:29:56 Car failed it's MOT as middle back seatbelt (which is never used) wouldn't plug in, £155 for a new fucking seatbelt and a top up of oil in my car. Been mugged right off here.
2555 2018-01-18 18:29:55 Exactly, your S still drives wonderfully! My M-B E320 has 95K and is running a bit rough nowadays as it needs a tune up (+ is leaking a little oil). But since I am weeks away from getting my Model 3, I have been holding off on spending hundreds of dollars to get my M-B tuned up.
2556 2018-01-18 18:29:53 Did you think it was right for a team with zero history or recent success to buy players for £40m when they were nobodies? Giving Robinho £200k? We spent what we earn, unlike you spending the rich Arabs oil money.
2557 2018-01-18 18:29:51 Need a car wash, oil change & new tires 
2558 2018-01-18 18:29:46 But its earned money not a Oil money...
2559 2018-01-18 18:29:42 Tell me why I went in for a $40 oil change and ended up spending $125.
2560 2018-01-18 18:29:39 #oil
2561 2018-01-18 18:29:24 I know it’s not recommended to ingest but if you have tea tree oil, use a towel to dry the canker sore and then apply tea tree oil soaked Qtip for as long as you can before saliva takes over. It numbs and aids in healing. Only thing that’s ever worked for me.
2562 2018-01-18 18:29:17 Off to a wedding at the weekend and thought I'd treat myself to a massage in the hotel - £75 - are they using unicorn oil at that price?

Makes mine at £35 to £45 a bargain.
2563 2018-01-18 18:29:11 What does an oil company need a supercomputer for? I mean I get that they have accounting and shipment manifests and pipeline controls and stuff. But do they seriously need a gigantic supercomputer for all that?
2564 2018-01-18 18:28:42 So the multiple failures of communist and socialist states, most recently the oil exporter Venezuela, and prior the USSR, is all due to the US government? You really need to check history. These systems do not work.
2565 2018-01-18 18:28:30 I was in line at Pete's coffee and when it was finally my turn I mumbled oil can. Pardon me the barista asked and I mumble again, oil can. NEXT she yells. Muwhahah on to the next! #airportlife #Shenanigans #channelingmyinnertinman
2566 2018-01-18 18:28:26 @kfc why is your fried chicken in the U.K. so oily? There’s no crunch to it, it’s literally as if someone cooked it and just dipped it in cold oil then served it. GROSS.
2567 2018-01-18 18:28:25 It's not all of Canada. Just Toronto and the oil boom areas. Huge real estate bubbles
2568 2018-01-18 18:28:23 Small people of low esteem are moved by petty and irrelevant antics. Was she supposed to baptise you with oil and move with a battalion to prove she is powerful? Kumira kumira disease. Lipa Kplc bill yako before we talk further
2569 2018-01-18 18:28:21 I need a £5m investment to drill more wells in an oil and gas field in N America. Equity incentives and full DD available  (worth a try isn’t it?!)

2574 2018-01-18 18:27:58 I’m sorry last time I checked CA and NY were part of the Republic and US Citizens, as for cuckoos I’m inclined to not call names, however what should we call those who voted for 6’3” 239 and believed his snake oil salesman promises? Naive? Sexist? Uninformed?
2575 2018-01-18 18:27:57 LOOKS GROSS

2577 2018-01-18 18:27:51 3/x ever since I was 17, I've worked one or more jobs - not "soft jobs" that the girls at my college got that gave them pocket money. I worked long hours in food service  (one time to get my hours, open-close); I'd come home smelling like sweat, chicken juice, and fry oil.

2580 2018-01-18 18:27:33 Best place for an oil change??

2583 2018-01-18 18:27:20 The charging stations create more emissions through production and energy than production of oil
2584 2018-01-18 18:27:18 Lmaoo you want oil !?
2585 2018-01-18 18:27:05 My whole house smells like DōTERRA On Guard oil and that means A) my family is staying healthy and B) I have finally converted them to the wellness world and my job here is done 
2586 2018-01-18 18:27:05 NO MORE OIL
2587 2018-01-18 18:26:59 That damn coconut oil.
2588 2018-01-18 18:26:53 Only way to save Venezuela from epic economic & humanitarian calamity is to have a Regional Peacekeeping Force go into Ve starting in Tulia State and secure the Maracaibo oil fields for the people of Venezuela.  Ramp up production with expatriates
2589 2018-01-18 18:26:41 Read “Merchants of Doubt” to confirm that oil companies used the same FUD, Fear Uncertainty and Doubt, as the tobacco industry - using the same firms.
2590 2018-01-18 18:26:35 Oh alright stepping the notch up are we .....I’ll never be an oil painting so I’ll stick to the wit ....oh happy Ipswich eve....a night I’m sure you’ve never forgotten 
2591 2018-01-18 18:26:21 Makes sense. Over the last 200 years, no one's ever heard the stories of the enablers of racism, bigotry, and xenophobia. I'm glad someone's finally sticking up for arms dealers, Wall Street bankers, and investors in global oil companies.
2592 2018-01-18 18:26:16 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
2593 2018-01-18 18:26:16 That's a new one on me. I would've tried anything myself, even castor oil if I could've got my hands on it. The no sleeping at night used to kill me
2594 2018-01-18 18:25:46 Seems like Almond oil is in a the good stuff for your hair and face. I am allergic, so what is a comparable substitute?

2603 2018-01-18 18:25:13 NAFTA....MEXICO and CANADA do not need you. That is a fact. All it is, is good business. You will lose close to 400,000 jobs and Billions of dollars. We will trade with each other and the Asian nations. Our electricity, our water, our lumber, our goods, our oil, our natural gas.
2604 2018-01-18 18:25:06 Funny. I went to the Vatican once and in no way felt a grievance against all those Popes that would have had an atheist like me bolied in oil.

2613 2018-01-18 18:24:10 The military is fueled virtually 100% by oil and gas is relieved he's a happy camper. We use the money for. Why? Easy. Ok, so you have any.
2614 2018-01-18 18:24:08 I usually get beef and there is no shortage of oil. Breakfast pizza is perfect AS IS tho...
2615 2018-01-18 18:24:04 Ok so everyone’s skin is different, but I feel like washing your face every other day can’t be good. This is my routine:
- remove makeup either with wipes or coconut oil
- shower every night and wash my face (exfoliate every few days)
- if I have a breakout, I put stridex on it
2616 2018-01-18 18:23:59 Life a bitch, why not enjoy it then
2617 2018-01-18 18:23:53 Essentially similar to your muesli, except you coat the mixture (without the chocolate/fruit) in a mix of oil and maple syrup and bake it on a low heat til it's crunchy and golden. 
Then be careful where you leave the trays to cool or the cat will jump in them accidentally ;-)
2618 2018-01-18 18:23:52 It was described as marriage maintenance. Just like changing the oil in your car.  Gross.

2623 2018-01-18 18:23:23 An oil painting only remains interesting for so long, there gotta be substance behind the style, otherwise it's a complete waste of time
2624 2018-01-18 18:23:15 Well at least it’s money that we earn and not OIL money
2625 2018-01-18 18:23:13 I know that part of its demise was the oil price rise just after people started to move in, but this was not helped by the concrete build and poor ventilation.
2626 2018-01-18 18:23:09 So grandmas furnace is out of oil so her idea to stay while there is snow on the ground is to leave the front door open

2638 2018-01-18 18:21:45 Overheard this convo at the University coffee shop, while in line.

1st person: ugh, my hand smells like oil!
2nd: Oil? What kind?
1st: um...
2nd: WD40? That's the only oil I know
1st: yeah...I guess...

2640 2018-01-18 18:21:16 How is oil #MAGA, @realDonaldTrump @JohnKasich ?
2641 2018-01-18 18:20:56 Haaaaate the smell of coconut but I loooove my hair and skin after lashing coconut oil on it 
2642 2018-01-18 18:20:43 finally on that oil pen flow; which means I’m finna be high all the time; which means 2018 is already off to a great start 
2643 2018-01-18 18:20:36 30 yrs ago, even though I have agriculture and animal sciences degrees, women rarely got hired in those positions. I waitressed, was a maid, delivered pizzas, and worked at Walmart to raise my kids. The jobs sucked but they paid the bills.
2644 2018-01-18 18:20:34 Even the people who were working in so called Oil company when they retire some of them with poor financial planning live In poverty
2645 2018-01-18 18:20:23 I’m getting my oil change at Valvoline and the guy asked me to turn on my head lights and I froze and got a funny look. IM SORRY MY LIGHTS ARE AUTOMATIC AND ITS NOON THE SUN IS STILL OUT

I give girls a bad rep when it comes to cars
2646 2018-01-18 18:20:18 #coplVitol, 
Energy will give Vitol preferential access to physical cargoes, two people familiar with the deal said, amounting to at least 30,000 barrels a day of crude produced in the oil-rich Niger Delta.These so-called pre-pay deals have become a major part of the oil trading
2647 2018-01-18 18:20:13 Benchmark price for oil in the 2017 budget is $44.5,oil price has been consistently over that value and current price is around $70pb. However,the excess crude account is not growing, rather we are drawing it down by about a billion dollars to fight vanquished Boko Haram.

2649 2018-01-18 18:20:05 I used castor oil and bio oil but mine where very very light to begin with.
2650 2018-01-18 18:19:57 Carbs, mostly rice. Fats, olive oil
2651 2018-01-18 18:19:49 I have some leftover animal fat. Gonna try to oven cook some potatoes in that today to compare to olive oil.
2652 2018-01-18 18:19:42 I have some of the world built! I use oil lamps or candles for lighting. I built a lot of unconventional housing. storage sheds, a garbage dump, and whatnot. uwu I'd just like some different water/plumbing options and food storage! canning would be hella.
2653 2018-01-18 18:19:41 They done killed 2 million civilians based on a lie to take the oil to try to bull shit to believe they’re helping them like????
2654 2018-01-18 18:19:37 Thanks Tom! Congrats Leah. I teach baby massage @YogaInhale. I started 5 week course last Fri, you would be welcome to join 2nd week. 11.30am. Or I will start another course Fri 2 Mar. Let me know if you want more details.  £50 incl organic oil, notes, tea & homemade cake!
2655 2018-01-18 18:19:18 They blew up with big oil and climate change too, adding more causes to the effect.
2656 2018-01-18 18:19:13 Ten acres is hardly enough to say "destroying BC's future food security ".  The two bands that oppose site c have benifit agreements with the oil and gas industry. So it fair to say they support the natural gas industry. Our region has also been carbon nutral for 6 years in a row

2661 2018-01-18 18:18:45 I guess I have met a few "big" people that still only sell skim-milk security at scale and make money, so they get bigger... over 10 years selling snake oil and never adding anything just regurgitating and doing PR

Bit sorry for the rant : )
But also glad to put it on the table
2662 2018-01-18 18:18:45 I don't entirely see it as snake oil I guess, but see why you would/do.

I've thrown similar things in with my <ahem/> snake oil offerings ;-)

Often times I've sadly had to acknowledge that customers only want the compliance box checked ... "One order of snake oil coming up!"
2663 2018-01-18 18:18:39 Put the body butter on top of a natural body oil (but not immediately) and your skin will feel AMAZING for a much longer time. Learned that from @HeyFranHey
2664 2018-01-18 18:18:18 Donald Trump is not the Savior that you're looking for is just as rich and corrupt as the rest of them the only difference is he makes it look sweet like a snake oil salesman and he provides you a little hope and then takes it all away.
2665 2018-01-18 18:18:13 Agenda for tonight: oil my scalp and relax
2666 2018-01-18 18:18:04 How can Citeh call players mercenaries, the only reason players have joined them since Arabs took over is for oil money. We buy our players with money generated from the rich history of the club. Sanchez was a United fan as a kid dreamed to play for us. Get over it!
2667 2018-01-18 18:17:40 I feel like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet mainlining Olbas Oil #poorlycliffy
2668 2018-01-18 18:17:16 So I know nothing about oil but the numbers look kinda good to me.
2669 2018-01-18 18:17:13 like shining oil, this night is dripping down
stars are slipping down, glistening
and I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
no deceiving now, it's time you let me know
2670 2018-01-18 18:17:11 are you tryna poison me about fish oil
2671 2018-01-18 18:16:51 That's excellent to see.
2672 2018-01-18 18:16:50 THANK YOU!
You can drive an oil tanker throught the holes in her reporting. She doesn't even realise she's selling her source out by running this w/o corroberation. Report it a while, she might get another girl w/ a similar thread. Maybe 2.
But, hey: get it first, right?
2673 2018-01-18 18:16:39 The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.
2674 2018-01-18 18:16:38 Tibz doesn't even have an olive oil coming out soon. 
2675 2018-01-18 18:16:13 Only came here for an oil change 
2676 2018-01-18 18:16:10 The snake oil salesman has returned!

2678 2018-01-18 18:16:00 I have coconut oil in eye so its watering and im sniffling. So it looks like crying.
2679 2018-01-18 18:15:55 @WhoopiGoldberg
Mr. Trump is the worst kind of Moron. He's a 21 century Snake oil salesman / Flem Flam man. Dangerous to the U.S, and the world. To find out what he said in that meeting, LIE DETECTOR TESTS WOULD DO IT. If Durbun will and the others won't, let the U.S public judge
2680 2018-01-18 18:15:42 "But he doesn't drink soy or use coconut oil!"
2681 2018-01-18 18:15:29 I fully understand need. What I don't understand is someone needing a job but not applying for certain jobs because they feel the job is "beneath" them. Society created that concept by treating workers in some positions as inferior. It's a job. Someone has to do it
2682 2018-01-18 18:15:18 This oil price is sooo man made it`s ridiculous!!!!  : \

2686 2018-01-18 18:14:46 Michael Bastasch writes in The Daily Signal that with the “US poised to shatter records for oil production,” America is “well on its way to becoming a net exporter of natural gas for the first time in decades.”
2687 2018-01-18 18:14:34 if we could discover a scalable material to replace petrochems for plastics, US might be good for becoming self-sustaining with oil for quite a while.

2696 2018-01-18 18:13:22 "Larger than expected decline"? Surely it's a miracle that #Venezuela oil industry hasn't totally collapsed like everything else & is producing anything at all!
2697 2018-01-18 18:13:13 No I can’t deny that but that’s not the sort of owners they are. Without oil and fuck knows what else money player sales along with other revenue streams has helped us grow. It’s a long time since we had so many great players

2706 2018-01-18 18:12:31 Confession...i love olive oil.
2707 2018-01-18 18:12:17 Just finished The Patch by @theturner . A very good summary of the past and present of the Oil Sands business. Divergent views presented with no judgement. Last chapter is critical. How does Canada chose to move forward?
2708 2018-01-18 18:12:17 Oh yes definitely! It's actually pretty common to use bacon with lentils here!. I cut one onions and three nice, big carrots (you can use more obviously), heated some olive oil, added them for a few minutes, then garlic, then about 250gr of green lentils and I'd say 750ml water
2709 2018-01-18 18:12:14 Just got an oil change. Still says change oil. Was charged for them to reset light.  Man.
2710 2018-01-18 18:12:01 There's a thing in warri called "beans pie". Basically, they cook beans with red oil and wrap flour round it.

This is why the glory of God has departed from that town.
2711 2018-01-18 18:11:46 I’m not sure I just use all of those and have seen major improvements but retinol and coconut oil as a moisturizer should help you out for sure then.. retinol just like ambi except stronger
2712 2018-01-18 18:11:22 Ok, so one study refutes all the others? What makes this one more correct, it also doesn't refute climate change just the severity so we should still be working to cut our reliance on oil.

2716 2018-01-18 18:11:05 my bigger concern was whether it would be bready, but the oil is mixed in pretty well throughout
2717 2018-01-18 18:11:04 So you are in favour of AB oil? Difficult to understand your position on this week to week. Oh well, soon gone.

2724 2018-01-18 18:10:14 Thank you Senator Bennet. Can you speak to Xcel passing these savings on to customers?  I have hesitated thus far due to cost.  Would like to see customer pricing reflect that renewable energy is now  competitive &even less expensive than coal/oil/gas.

2728 2018-01-18 18:09:29 Always moisturize even if you’re oily. The skin will overproduce oil if it’s dry, so keep it hydrated
2729 2018-01-18 18:09:24 You make research and at the same time, greek-cypriots are drilling for gas and oil. Do you find it successful? You don’t dare to stop Greeks. You amuse me.

2756 2018-01-18 18:04:59 Did you know the first commercial model T ran off of help oil, not gasoline.. in order for Ford and standard oil to manipulate the market to their advantage...they strong armed the government to make help illegal.. all new technology is exploitive at its origin..humans suck.

2797 2018-01-18 18:00:56 Fun fact: the Earth can sustain a human population of around two billion. Oil has enabled that number to grow to seven billion BUT oil is a finite resource. When it runs out, about two thirds of the population will die off, beginning immediately.
2798 2018-01-18 18:00:47 @GovMurphy I say “Yes” to over 2 ounces of dispensed medical marijuana and also want dispensaries to offer the oil for medical purposes.  While pharma has its place, the side effects of medications for cancer are often worse than the disease.

2803 2018-01-18 18:00:17 Last night someone was telling me they use coconut oil to cook their eggs. I said I’d rather put it in my hair. And they said, “I don’t like eggs in my hair.”

....Coconut oil. I was talking about the coconut oil. Still it was a good laugh for us for like 5 minutes.

2809 2018-01-18 17:59:49 Way to go @SkinnyPancake with your Oath of Action! Cant' wait to give "newtella" a try!  Another palm oil free product is our Hazelnut Five Star Bar!
2810 2018-01-18 17:59:46 What he’s saying is that he is in favour of legislation that would make it more difficult for companies in Aberdeen to recruit the specialists it needs for the oil and other industries.
2811 2018-01-18 17:59:43 Is it legal where you live by the way? (Idc if it isn't, it's just that it isn't here and doesn't even seem to be on the horizon anytime soon. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET CBD OIL OVER HERE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!)

2815 2018-01-18 17:59:16 Trump’s nomination is possibly a disqualifier. IMO Jim Bridenstine is capable, formidable, and experienced. Yet his Congressional vote track record is:
anti-gay
anti-immigrant
anti-marijuana decriminalization
anti-women’s choice
anti-education
pro-Big Business
pro-Big Oil
2816 2018-01-18 17:58:49 would be kinda like going into geology for oil, y’know?
2817 2018-01-18 17:58:48 5 years is pretty recent mate. You started following them after the oil money was pumped in. So stop making shit arguments and agree that ur club is just another blackburn Rovers if you know what I mean
2818 2018-01-18 17:58:45 WTI oil at $64/barrel, near unchanged.
2819 2018-01-18 17:58:42 it's a little more expensive than olive oil but I find that I use less of it because it doesn't burn off so fast
2820 2018-01-18 17:58:40 God is going to reward us if we take our lumps. God and the oil businessmen. Any day now.

2822 2018-01-18 17:58:36 (1) Nigeria will continue to have inadequate and obsolete accounting procedures, cost control measures and legislative frameworks for the management of land and property that are associated with oil industry operations. #PIGB
2823 2018-01-18 17:58:18 I still use that OGX shampoo and the one I use has peppermint oil in it :)
2824 2018-01-18 17:58:17 That’s not me. He got in the way of my photo. Once again you’re disparaging people’s looks despite being NO oil painting yourself. 
2825 2018-01-18 17:58:11 Y just coat the okra with a touch of oil, just enough to barely give it a shine, then salt, pepper and under the broiler. Get it dark brown then turn.
2826 2018-01-18 17:58:06 3 parts cocoa butter to 1 part coconut oil (or oil of your choosing). Melt together over steam (not direct heat!), refrigerate until firm but not hard, then whip it up using a hand mixer or something of the sort, and voila the best body moisturizer I've ever used!!
2827 2018-01-18 17:58:00 I’ve been at several different automotive garages lately, oil changes, new tires, check engine lights, etc. question, is @iontv standard programming for garage waiting rooms?
2828 2018-01-18 17:57:55 Yeah coconut oil just too oily I’ve been using that 
2829 2018-01-18 17:57:55 I would just put on my coconut oil, step into my ski suit, zip it up, and swish out the door.
2830 2018-01-18 17:57:28 Full short oil position on now. Shorting indices as well. Now its time to go for a run...Jesse Livermore was right, waiting is the most difficult part of trading.

2833 2018-01-18 17:57:16 2/ The Kochs own the largest tar sand lease in Canada and Keystone pipeline. They pipe oil to their Wood River Illinois refinery to be shipped to New Orleans for export.

2838 2018-01-18 17:56:58 Momar Gadhafi was loved by his people. He was the only leader in history to declare housing as a legal right. He was uniting Africa and had great plans to sell oil for gold and had support of many other African nations. That’s why Obama executed him.
2839 2018-01-18 17:56:37 Water to SA is like oil to the US 

We've got our neighbours working hard to give us their water and we still running out!
2840 2018-01-18 17:56:35 For electricity, yes. Not sure about gas (ie not sure if "Supply of fuel oil and gas; supply of lubricating oils" in the proposed mandatory full rate list includes natural gas as piped into homes. I hope that gets clarified/changed.
2841 2018-01-18 17:56:23 nobody care about oil city

CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HAVING A #PIGB

The following are the consequences of not having an overarching oil industry law to govern the activities of the sector:
2844 2018-01-18 17:56:14 Would you rather play for real Madrid or Malaga with oil money, a team with 350 million fans or a team with 40 thousand fans ?
2845 2018-01-18 17:56:12 Btw looking at "saudi aramco subsidaries" list it's easy to spot only oil refinery plant which is also not aramco-branded :)
2846 2018-01-18 17:56:07 Trump loves to play the “no one loves our military card for than me” when it’s for convenient his own interests or to sell snake oil to his base. When compared to the words of previous comments he’s made about certain veterans, the hypocrisy is shameful.
2847 2018-01-18 17:56:00 Have 3 days to find a place to crash until I leave for the oil fields in a month or so. 
2848 2018-01-18 17:55:39 Thanks for the  opportunity can't wait to try out this New Precious Oil Hairspray product! infused with a touch of Argan Oil! #elnett #preciousoil #influenster #hairspray #oil #new #lorealparis

2850 2018-01-18 17:55:35 Most likely through internstional transactions. 3 mai ways. 1.They founded ICE Brent, an oil futures ecchange in London. High speed dark trades in the futures market they control.

2851 2018-01-18 17:55:33 The biggest thing that annoys me about my company is how our director refers to us as "resources". Call us people, damn it. Last time I checked, I bled red, not oil. 
2852 2018-01-18 17:55:20 酒飲んで早朝出勤してんの超人か？
2853 2018-01-18 17:55:18 Retinol, witch hazel, coconut oil, chemical peels..
2854 2018-01-18 17:55:15 Jojoba oil and castor oil are all you really need.
2855 2018-01-18 17:55:14 Tips for glowing skin:

Argan oil,rose hip oil,lavender oil, frankincense oil

Also eating plant based helps a lot !!
2856 2018-01-18 17:54:48 Peppermint and lavender essential oil
2857 2018-01-18 17:54:46 And let’s not forget they do this so they can say “our visitors are down” and sell off our national treasure to big oil.
2858 2018-01-18 17:54:44 We have awesome CBD coconut oil tinctures from Select Oil- 1000mg for $60.  Choose from unflavored, lemon ginger, lavender or peppermint
2859 2018-01-18 17:54:41 I think we will need to see oil cracked before gold is potentially ready for a short term leg down.
2860 2018-01-18 17:54:38 Switching to a renewable and sustainable energy economy yields a structure that will endure. No wars for oil that will eventually run out anyways. Energy, Industry and Transportation, all when “Greened”, make  business opportunities, improve humanity and our planets’ health.
2861 2018-01-18 17:54:35 Shut it down ,park ships,party!!

Then run the snake oil salesman out of town!
2862 2018-01-18 17:54:32 He talks in circles so he’s always right. If there’s 2 sides to a story, he’s on both. No matter what, past, present, or future he’ right! If there were more time&space dimensions he’d be right on all sides! Familiarity breeds contempt of this snake oil salesman.
2863 2018-01-18 17:54:17  U die well o, u no go even fit oil  her
2864 2018-01-18 17:54:16 Who caused Mexico to be so dangerous, NAFTA, drug war, guns to cartels so they would kill each other off to get their oil for our corps.

2872 2018-01-18 17:53:14 3/3
One thing is we talk about tier 1 production when it comes to producers. But Refiners will always use their tier 1 crude oil before they use they lower quality ones.
2873 2018-01-18 17:53:14 70 dollar oil change like really 
2874 2018-01-18 17:53:12 Happy Birthday to America’s Most Beautiful City, the REAL Oil Capital Of The World!

2879 2018-01-18 17:52:52 *food security*

Transport costs are up. The currency has weakened, inflation is up. These are the causes of increased food prices

If there had been increased savings during the oil boom years perhaps there wouldn't be need for devaluation
I personally abhor currency pegs though
2880 2018-01-18 17:52:46 with an economy that increasingly centralizes operations we need to figure out what Alberta should be the centre of if not oil and gas. We have perhaps the largest concentration of engineering and trades talent per capita in the world... lets mobilize it!!

2887 2018-01-18 17:51:46 Yeah by Trump's "economics" I have a $200 trade deficit with Walmart, cause that's how much I spent there.  But if I stop shopping there the deficit will disappear! Wow amazing.
(never mind I'd have to get the stuff somewhere else, probably Whole Foods)
2888 2018-01-18 17:51:39 I've never had grape seed oil or even heard of it so I cannot comment unfortunately
2889 2018-01-18 17:51:36 With POTUS sane energy policies home /business heating & cooling bills should decline soon, or Fed needs to investigate big oil.
2890 2018-01-18 17:51:22 Nope, and nope. 

And if Smecklers isn’t actually a thing, it should be. 

I do have wintergreen essential oil. And peppermint.
2891 2018-01-18 17:51:22 I just started trying the elf salcylic acid/ tea tree oil stuff. It's $2 so worth a try!

2895 2018-01-18 17:50:59 We cut oil supply to Japan economically destroying that country...what do you think Japan would do? America shot first economically...then when they fought back we dropped a couple of nukes

2933 2018-01-18 17:46:06 Oil companies divest. They invest billions in renewable engergies - mostly in Europe and ASIA. This is why they actually opposed Trump. They see renewable engergies as more important than coal and oil. After all The entire coal industry employs fewer people than Arby's

2955 2018-01-18 17:44:07 The US should just ban oil imports but also we get all the oil sent to us for free as part of a free trial.
2956 2018-01-18 17:44:06 仕事したくねえ……
2957 2018-01-18 17:43:47 Dropped my Subi off for an oil change and walked to the office in 10° weather... wasn't that bad. I mean, the joint I smoked and the @Starbucks I was drinking probably helped a little. 
2958 2018-01-18 17:43:43 2018 we all about Canola oil, fuck olives they're garbage anyway
2959 2018-01-18 17:43:42 You can buy stock in the “ oil baron”’s company and be an oil baron too !
2960 2018-01-18 17:43:28 i got lucky and got today off, and i decided to do my own oil change rather than let the dealer do it for free so i could maximize time this afternoon...$40 later i wish i just took it in LOL
2961 2018-01-18 17:43:14 I’m irked at the amount of money I’m about to spend for what was supposed to be a simple oil change, & state inspection.
2962 2018-01-18 17:43:10 It's not just oil, major car companies build cars there and import them to here, including major parts
2963 2018-01-18 17:43:02 Noooo that’s so sad :( I almost knocked a bottle of Argan oil off the counter last night and had a heart attack
2964 2018-01-18 17:43:00 @SenToomey We need to immediately stop ALL fracking, drilling and coal mining in Pennsylvania so that we can change to clean energy sources. I made my living in oil and coal mining for years and know how harmful it is.

2969 2018-01-18 17:42:27 And then when the oil companies lose billions after having to clean up entire ecosystems and pay off the families of killed or permanently injured workers, is it going to be worth the few million $$ they saved by not operating to code?

2972 2018-01-18 17:42:02 Yes, EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil. Good quality #EVOO comes in dark-tinted glass bottles (light, heat or oxygen can cause oxidation), label should say 'first cold press' (heat allows producers extracting more oil but heat destroys nutrients) and should be stored in a dark cool cupboard

2979 2018-01-18 17:41:27 Oregonians want all forms of energy, not just Political Correct forms of energy. Hydro, Natural Gas, Oil, Coal, Wind, Solar......
2980 2018-01-18 17:41:25 They are deliberately thumbing their noses at these "controlling regulations" as if they're overstepping. But what they do is save people's lives and prevent massive disasters and oil spills, etc. It's irresponsible and beyond stupid. No common freaking sense at all.
2981 2018-01-18 17:41:19 Science: Pimples are caused by excessive oil in Your Skin..

All of those pieces were hand crafted and sealed with beeswax and linseed oil. What you are seeing is the natural grain of the wood.
2990 2018-01-18 17:40:20 But if you're banting then you should know that meat and cooking oils (esp coconut oil/olive oil and other natural oils are recommended)

2998 2018-01-18 17:39:14 By opening virtually the entire US coast to offshore drilling, including areas previously unavailable to the energy industry, there would be more drilling pads, pipelines & tankers operating in U.S. waters — and in all likelihood, the number of oil spills associated with them.
2999 2018-01-18 17:39:13 This the first time a regime intentionally collapses oil production to allow the administration of the production by foreign powers.

3011 2018-01-18 17:37:58 Don't think your attack is all that potent if Salah was taken out of the equation. You'd score goals but he's the oil to your attack.

Think the same can be said of Pogba regarding our midfield and attack. Plus he's only played about 15 games in the PL.

3016 2018-01-18 17:37:22 If it uses more oil to recycle than it does to make it from scratch then it is not helping conserve resources. There may be other external factors to recommend recycling, but I am talking purely about the use of a single limited resource at this moment.

3019 2018-01-18 17:37:10 PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: essential oils are not okay internally or topically. (In some cases once diluted in a carrier oil it is then safe topically but contact your local herbalist not doterra.)
3020 2018-01-18 17:36:54 Uptrend does appear to be out of steam here but end of the day if we keep drawing inventory aggressively vs 5 yr avgs then oil will keep going up because that’s what happens when a commodity gets scarce. Figure refiners will stop buying at some point tho.

3031 2018-01-18 17:35:06 This tweet doesn't make sense to me. The question is how much oil it takes to make X amount of plastic from scratch versus the amount it takes to make X amount via recycling when you factor in the energy costs of collection and separation.
3032 2018-01-18 17:35:02 Tell me why these people told me it was gonna be $80 for an oil change wth

3034 2018-01-18 17:34:51 Do you really expect major oil drilling off the CT coastline?  If so, please tell us Dick what drugs you've been using.  There's no oil there.  There won't be any drilling there either.
3035 2018-01-18 17:34:51 Just over a year ago my uncle was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. It was in his lymph nodes. Didn't look like he had more than a few months. He began taking cannabis oil and today he was given the all clear. All that is left is scar tissue.
3036 2018-01-18 17:34:39 “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” and money supply hasn’t increased. Oil is $69 a barrel, 1 yr ago was $58..a 20% increase, not 40%. Sterling almost back to pre-referendum levels which will reduce import-led inflationary pressures.
3037 2018-01-18 17:34:29 You held a 9/11 first responder bill hostage for oil money.  Holding sick kids hostage seems well within your wheelhouse, Mitch.

3056 2018-01-18 17:32:19 Don't let the streets employ you cas thats either a slippery slop on grease or oil 
3057 2018-01-18 17:32:18 US$ depreciation of 10% and oil back up to $70/bbl are 2 sides of the same coin.  It is a function of the tax cut which has put more US$s into circulation.  Shale oil fracking ought to keep oil/gas prices from going to high, because supply will come on line to meet the demand.
3058 2018-01-18 17:32:15 Guy at the oil change place gave me a free bottle of water then swindled me for $150. 

Good thing it’s a company truck and company card.

Told them to throw in some free car washes though so I think I still won.
3059 2018-01-18 17:32:15 @MSNBC  Change way you guys interview trump supporters/voters. Try asking them more pointed questions like; “ so you are in favor of selling off our national parks to oil companies?” Or, “ then you agree to having oil rigs you can see from our beautiful beaches ?”

3064 2018-01-18 17:31:54 So my theory on the Irving Family is publicly they say they support Energy Easy (because who wouldn't support Canada publicly) but privately i suspect they asked Trudeau to kill Energy East as they would much rather buy cheaper no questions asked conflict oil from offshore.

3082 2018-01-18 17:30:17 @gelderon52 in a comment u said, "new assessments have changed the idea that the “legacy oil” had an EROI=100. It seems that crude oil never had an EROI larger than about 30, and the fastest growing periods were for EROIs around 20". I'd love a reference...
3083 2018-01-18 17:30:14 @shanselman I know of an easier way. Go vegan, stop oil and sugar... Eat only organic. Eat raw veggies/fruits as much as you can. You may come out of medication in few weeks.
3084 2018-01-18 17:30:05 I put coconut oil on my hands and in my hair and I smell like a samoa cookie. Now I'm hungry.
3085 2018-01-18 17:30:02 That is amazing!! I badly want to try CBD oil for anxiety etc. But I’m terrified of getting enough thc to flunk a test. And I don’t like pharmaceuticals. So I end up choosing between my job and mental health. 
3086 2018-01-18 17:30:00 Drinking coffee at a Safeway in Longmont while my car's oil gets changed. So refreshing to be around people who aren't rich.
3087 2018-01-18 17:30:00 X
Why was alcohol banned ( Prohibition ) in the US in the 20s you ask? 
Because the big oil tycoons were scared that engines running on ethanol would undermine their gasoline fortunes and dreams.
Simple as. :)

3092 2018-01-18 17:29:17 Sure he is. At least when he is paid off by the oil and mining industries, he stays bought, so you could say that’s a positive.
3093 2018-01-18 17:29:16 $SDRL -even if oil goes to $100 which it won't, shareholders can't be saved. Assets worth $2-3Bn below debt. All value goes to debtholders. $OIL

3097 2018-01-18 17:29:00 I don't understand this insistence on putting everyone in harm's way for what? Oil, gas? People should die for it? People should eat poisoned food?  Breathe foul air? Why? I can't make any sense of this? Corporations should come out and admit this is what they want.
3098 2018-01-18 17:28:43 Bad Sega. A number of songs are not on the soundtrack. Both Green Hill acts, both Oil Ocean acts, Super Sonic and the ending themes. Not worth it unless it's complete.

3103 2018-01-18 17:28:01 This catches Minerals Council & APPEA oil & gas.
Bill requires Australians to register if they are lobbying on behalf of foreign entities is “startling” in its reach & unsuspecting organisations will face criminal penalties for failure to register, Senate committee hears

3104 2018-01-18 17:27:54 when you guys start living the way you talk than I'll listen, live off the grid, use no fossil fuels, products made with and by fossil fuel products, until than you're all hypocrites and are the reason we continue to drill for oil, shut up and walk the talk
3105 2018-01-18 17:27:51 I need an oil change and windshield wiper fluid 
3106 2018-01-18 17:27:45 #PIGB will allow the Nigerian government to retain a higher proportion of the revenue that is derived from oil industry operations.
3107 2018-01-18 17:27:39 I need an oil change 
3108 2018-01-18 17:27:29 @SebGorka and America. Like oil and water.

3111 2018-01-18 17:26:54 BI - Do something useful discuss how USA spends more welfare to corporate welfare queens each year - trillions - more than spent on military, Social Security each year. Corporate welfare queens - banks, Apple, Facebook, Google, oil, coal, cable, prescription drugs, etc
3112 2018-01-18 17:26:51 Ashanti need a ball player or oil typhoon lol. Leave these rappers alone. She too bad.
3113 2018-01-18 17:26:47 No more coconut oil on my face after today. Thank god.
3114 2018-01-18 17:26:39 The country needs to continue moving to keep the economy going  because oil won’t !
3115 2018-01-18 17:26:39 Hopefully the EU grown biofuels are truly less emissions. A separate concern is what would happen to European nature if the local industry really replaced palm oil in biofuels
3116 2018-01-18 17:26:38 You are loved more than you know xx (hurry up and get some CBD oil, I want to hear all about it). Xx 
3117 2018-01-18 17:26:36 Many Albertans see the world through an oil-drop lens. Everything's rosy when oil is doing well. The get cranky when it isn't. That is the weakness Mr. Kenney exploits.
3118 2018-01-18 17:26:34 Bro everytime i get an oil change they juice me out of way more then i was pose to pay  always adding extra shit
3119 2018-01-18 17:26:21 Sighhhhh lol when I see all of the oil remaining smh
3120 2018-01-18 17:26:20 our club is in the best state possible in the current climate of oil merchents! our manager appointment by fsg was vital to the progress wee have made! jk will bring players wee could have previously got know where near, will just take some time! mean while enjoy the 7 nils
3121 2018-01-18 17:26:07 It's due diligence. We all need to question who's doing what with our data, and why. It's the 'new oil' - there is value in it. Therefore I want to know why @WebEx would want to "change all my data". I'm not sure they know why as they have not had the courtesy to reply...
3122 2018-01-18 17:25:52 I doubt CBD oil is gonna stop the stomach pain and diarrhea 
3123 2018-01-18 17:25:49 $40 would drive out a lot of emissions from electric system. Would need higher price, if using price based system, to get oil users to electrify. Most analysts assume price rises over time, not set & forget.
3124 2018-01-18 17:25:30 @TGBrews If variants are still being planned, might I suggest something similar to the Vanilla Cinnamon Term Oil.  So good.
3125 2018-01-18 17:25:28 So you're all for low-paying menial  jobs at Amazon but totally against high-paying skilled labor jobs in the oil industry is that right?
3126 2018-01-18 17:25:21 Wow the A380 returns from extinction ... Saved by oil money
3127 2018-01-18 17:25:13 LOL, LOL. As if the profit for illegal drugs is not as much an incentive for war was the profit from oil.
3128 2018-01-18 17:25:13 it all a matter of supply and demand, the oil companies cut the supply and demand more money biggest crooks in the world
3129 2018-01-18 17:25:10 Found my coconut oil, bouta get back to glowingggg

3132 2018-01-18 17:24:59 This is very sad facts that , we are too late regarding to the Climate change actions,

3136 2018-01-18 17:24:19 Sooooo I just broke the oil sheen can and it won’t stop spraying everywhere

3138 2018-01-18 17:23:57 I am sorry to say that it's also nice with coconut oil, which has the added benefit of leaving a tasty lipbalmy film on your lips
3139 2018-01-18 17:23:43 LIAR. Your TAX SCAM is on the backs of the middle class; your treatment of DACA, CHIP, Health Care is APPALLING; your failure to  accept a Bipartisan Budget your requested "pillars" is DEPLORABLE; removing oil regulations is DESPICABLE!!! You, MONSTER, need to RESIGN!!! 
3140 2018-01-18 17:23:22 Lmao I haven’t paid for a oil change or anything involving my car in a while. My mechanic js hooks me up.
3141 2018-01-18 17:23:22 But Norway has a nationalized oil industry, so I'm not sure "owning the means of production" is the issue there.
3142 2018-01-18 17:23:16 Let us not forget Mitch McConnel held 9/11 1st responder bill hostage for oil money.   Your concern is a facade.
3143 2018-01-18 17:23:16 @Paraco_Gas just messaged you about my oil delivery problems and inability to get service
, please advise asap on how I can speak to a supervisor, thank you.
3144 2018-01-18 17:23:11 It's a dry oil with Salicylic Acid! I had a few stubborn, hormonal breakouts that literally melted overnight.
3145 2018-01-18 17:22:47 今期かなり調子が良いと思うんだが
3146 2018-01-18 17:22:42 Another Trump first!  Problem is they’re all terrible firsts. First to refuse to release his tax returns, first to lie repeated, DAILY, about everything, first to claim that all legitimate news organizations are fake, first to appoint an oil company lobbyist as head of the EPA.
3147 2018-01-18 17:22:24 Oil pulling with babe 
3148 2018-01-18 17:22:20 i had mine for a year when i took it out and i have absolutely no scar!! i put hella vitamin e oil on it just to be sure bc everyones body is different 8-)))
3149 2018-01-18 17:22:03 Keep the close watch on increased excise, custom duties too when you and other states imposed during fall of oil prices. So, ROLLBACK fully
3150 2018-01-18 17:22:02 I’m livid. James Martin got too much money to act like a preferred customer should wait more than an hour for an oil change
3151 2018-01-18 17:21:54 I change my own oil.
3152 2018-01-18 17:21:54 Norway is great despite the socialists, not because of them.  Having $1 Trillion in an oil endowment may juice things up a bit.  This for a population of 5.5 Million.
3153 2018-01-18 17:21:46 A challenge?  That's like spilling 100,000 metric tons of crude oil in the Gulf and calling it "a small spill."  This is a disaster; as is the @GOP
3154 2018-01-18 17:21:43 Only way to save Venezuela from epic economic & humanitarian calamity is to have a Regional Peacekeeping Force go into Ve starting in Tulia State and secure the Maracaibo oil fields for the people of Venezuela.  Ramp up production with expatriates
3155 2018-01-18 17:21:41 Ibuprofen for swelling. Really wish I could try CBD oil but I'll have to wait until I get this clunky cast off.

3159 2018-01-18 17:21:18 Im on fire I’ve been at the dealership alll morning for an oil change! I will NEVER go back to James Martin Chevrolet ever again for an oil change !!!

3167 2018-01-18 17:20:30 I think it depends on the oil you use. Ive tried multiple tea tree oils and some just work better than others
3168 2018-01-18 17:20:24 Yeah that and cooked are not what you want to hear. Kinda like fired up and things that go boom in an oil refinery.

3181 2018-01-18 17:18:45 The #PIGB promotes more transparency in the running of the oil industry: This bill is aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in the administration of the petroleum resources of Nigeria.
3182 2018-01-18 17:18:32 Unfortunately Stevo BMD is hating the individuals and not the company involved. Christopher Archibald Mergatroy Oil has a lot of warrants and is now assured of a good Xmas 2019 a cool Mil. Brings out the love

3184 2018-01-18 17:18:27 @RF_Ohl just got my oil bill for my house in Kresgeville... $3.69 per gallon. WOW! I called another local provider in Carbon County - $2.71/gal.  Just to double check I called another - $2.79/gal. This is price gouging by R.F. Ohl ! Why are you ripping off your customers?
3185 2018-01-18 17:18:25 We're a handy target for them all..take it he wouldn't have been a mercenary if he'd signed for little city who have to survive on oil revenues and Pep who likes to work with the clubs youth. Keown was a knob as a player and the older he gets the better he was in his head Fukim!
3186 2018-01-18 17:18:25 I know a lot of guys in the oil & gas industry who straight out of high school were making $90,000yr, busted their ass, worked their way up and now making $180,000+. Voted for Trump because they wanted to keep more of their money, border security & keep their jobs.
3187 2018-01-18 17:18:21 First time oil pulling ....
3188 2018-01-18 17:18:13 Great and since we most likely do not mtg these in tUSA b/c oil/gas cos are subsidized, thereby profit margins not possible, solar cos will have to charge more, thus causing alt-energy means to be put into an even bigger hole. Help! @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi

By the way, that's by the by because your initail premise is bollocks.

3200 2018-01-18 17:16:56 There is an argument for basic income in that the government shouldn't earn the revenue from public lands and instead it should be given out to the public. For example, oil rights in Alaska.
3201 2018-01-18 17:16:53 The latter.

3206 2018-01-18 17:16:28 I know there was,  You were the one trying to claim that United's wealth is down to success and it partly is but the catalyst for the success and wealth was down to external money coming from being a PLC and therefore is no different to oil money, + the premise is accurate.
3207 2018-01-18 17:16:17 Tea tree oil! It will dry them out
3208 2018-01-18 17:16:15 No the Emirates plan worked fine. The problem was the fact the Emirates plan was    before Russian and Oil money entered the premier league
3209 2018-01-18 17:15:52 Very surprising. Oil tanker on fire outside Kandla port, chances of loss of life, pollution etc but TV channels busy discussing politics, Midi etc and sophisticated lot busy in Modi bashing. Sickening. Worthless
3210 2018-01-18 17:15:49 Nails done, oil changed, first part of shopping completed. Is it time for wine yet?
3211 2018-01-18 17:15:46 I'm not quite endgamey enough to just farm all day because I'm still trying to push forward in the game's maps while getting my teams up. My oil ends up expended every day, even when trying to optimise use

3217 2018-01-18 17:15:13 #PIGB will have ripple effect in the Nigeria economy, to some extent corruption revolving around oil sector would be tackled and transparency would prevail thereby changing the bad current status quo.
3218 2018-01-18 17:15:13 Daily Loyalty gives Oil.  Use that on your current lantern :)
3219 2018-01-18 17:15:12 Coconut Oil is SO GOOD at removing makeup. smooth it over your face, and take a thin layer and coat your eyelashes and then wipe with a rag. comes right off
3220 2018-01-18 17:15:07 Healing oil 
3221 2018-01-18 17:15:06 that much is clear! horrible mismanagement of their oil resources eg
3222 2018-01-18 17:14:59 Japan was in a remarkable quandary at this stage. Can't continue war in China without US trade, can't expand into SE Asia for the oil and resources there with US presence in Philippines.
3223 2018-01-18 17:14:58 Agreed. Oklahoma gives new businesses (mostly big oil) whatever they want: land, tax breaks, guarantees. That's why the state is so broke (and broken). Can't pay teachers, colleges closing, embezzlement/misappropriations at state agencies, etc.

3245 2018-01-18 17:11:53 #ExxonKnew No matter what they try to pretend, they knew that burning oil and gas would ramp up our CO2 levels, AND they knew that this would warm-up the planet. Their own studies by their own scientists said so!!
3246 2018-01-18 17:11:48 The #PIGB establishes better regulation for the oil industry: The passage of Petroleum Industry Governance Bill is a major step to reform and better-regulate Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. It is also aimed at stimulating fresh investments in the oil sector.

MOAR fancy version: add Himalayan salt (a few grinds), sage and lavender oil, grapeseed oil and vegetable glycerin


3251 2018-01-18 17:11:11 This will truly have a few extra cooking oil.
3252 2018-01-18 17:11:05 I'm scared of weed because of my anxiety disorder, but I'd like to try CBD oil for vaping. I know people without disorders can also experience anxiety, is that something that ever happened to you?
3253 2018-01-18 17:11:03 They keep telling him his companions are dead
They keep telling him that, even if the cave-in didn't crush them, the thirst surely did

He doesn't care
With oil dripping out of his face, the warforged continues to dig with his hands
He WILL find them
He WILL save his friends
3254 2018-01-18 17:11:01 Indeed, indeed.

If you just take omega 3 fatty acids in any form, you'll extract that effect. Get fish oil capsules from a good brand. That's probably the best way to do it. And no risk of mercury poisoning.

3258 2018-01-18 17:10:45 The emphasis on local content policy in the #PIGB will not only be in the area of skills, but would also be applicable to materials sourcing. This translates to more jobs for our local contractors especially those from the oil producing regions.

3271 2018-01-18 17:09:24 I used a face oil last night as a moisturizer instead of my normal one +  think my skin this morning is better moisturized even after I washed and applied my light spf-moisturizer fave. This is my life pursuit.
3272 2018-01-18 17:09:12 A word of wisdom, ladies & gents:
Don't oil paint on particle board.
It still works, but it's a rough surface & the wood absorbs EVERYTHING.
3273 2018-01-18 17:09:11 With effective implementation #PIGB, our local refineries could be brought back to the limelight, then we forget about refining crude oil abroad.

3280 2018-01-18 17:08:28 Let me get this straight. Trump is offended that we buy oil and food and car parts from Mexico? Because we choose to? And he thinks that having that option is a really bad deal for Americans?

3289 2018-01-18 17:07:07 I am on board the decarbonization train, but to sue the oil companies is missing the point. Where there is demand, someone will step up to supply. As long as ppl purchase fast food, ppl will be obese. McD's isn't to blame for obesity anymore than big oil is for climate change.

3300 2018-01-18 17:05:33 You accepted every factual statement made; Obama did not send Iran any money. The multi lateral agreement freed 150 bn of Iranian oil money that had been blocked. Tool is an appropriate name for you.
3301 2018-01-18 17:05:19 It's a shift in employment. Look at all of the new jobs created in oil.

3335 2018-01-18 17:02:05 Regardless, water benders should be able to bend oil as well, am I right? See where I'm going with this? As a water bender, you're also technically a chili bender

3346 2018-01-18 17:00:45 Anyone who thinks the conflicts in the ME (especially Syria) are not about oil and power are severely naive. USA is a proxy for Israhell. All our tax dollars go towards Zionist foreign policy, protection and expansion of Israel.
3347 2018-01-18 17:00:44 Capsaicin is the component in chili that makes your mouth burn right? And it's also an oil? And water benders are technically liquid benders? We learn this in the blood bending arc because I mean blood isn't water but it's a liquid.

3364 2018-01-18 16:58:20 You've not understood his point. @RossThomson_MP is referring to the SNP talking about having a different immigration system for Scotland to that of the rest of the UK & NI. He's right, that would be unhelpful.
Oh, and I do know how the Oil & Gas sector works.

何故あのとき千代ちゃんに相談できなかったんだろう、なんで少しでも親父はまだ生きてるんじゃないか？とふ抜けた希望をもったのだろうで最大につらいのは友人に頼れず先に逝ったことや
3375 2018-01-18 16:56:21 My wannabe organic ass has been using coconut oil as lube for months, and now I’m learning that it’s not good for my inner flora  time to order more Foria I guess
3376 2018-01-18 16:56:19 i watched this video first period about OIL... and FUEL.. u bet my ass i slept through it all

3380 2018-01-18 16:55:50 Thanks! But we need Sentinel1 radar for this oil spill.  Got any?

3387 2018-01-18 16:55:09 Oil Minister claims he is keeping close watch on petrol,  deisel prices. Lie. He is keeping closed eye, not close watch.
3388 2018-01-18 16:55:09 United spend what they earn unlike other oil funded teams and takeover teams.

3391 2018-01-18 16:55:04 Females don't never check their oil. They just put gas in the car and drive.
3392 2018-01-18 16:54:50 raw shea butter does me good. Coconut oil also works for me.
3393 2018-01-18 16:54:43 That’s hoping a lot Ed. We are already seeing signs of inflation creeping in. The dollar has loss nearly 10%, oil is back to $70/barrel, we’re at or near full employment. The global economy is expanding without us being in significant trade deals. There’s some minuses out there.

3398 2018-01-18 16:53:49 who advises to keep putting nitrites in meat? who advises GMO is OK? @realDonaldTrump Wants TRUTH not manipulated reports slanting truths
it's ok to FracK? what about oil in the soil?
3399 2018-01-18 16:53:47 change the oil of your computer
3400 2018-01-18 16:53:38 They can make it any number they want and hype it as much as they want. If people want to buy snake oil and believe in the tooth fairy, so be it.
3401 2018-01-18 16:53:36 Once they finished with my oil change, I’m gone fill up the tank & grab some to eat..
3402 2018-01-18 16:53:24 Oil money bitches, average wages in Norway are bigger and that's why it's more expensive there. A pack of smokes can cost like 15€ in Norway but here in Finland it's like 6€.
3403 2018-01-18 16:53:20 was well fun cleaning up the 6 bottles of oil I spilt at work 
3404 2018-01-18 16:53:19 Just realised that the M&S Peanut Butter I bought (a peanut butter brand I never usually buy) has palm oil in it. Now I feel shitty.
3405 2018-01-18 16:53:19 same though - when I added hyaluronic acid into my routine my cystic acne and oil production cleared up drastically
3406 2018-01-18 16:53:16 So true. Just like the Iraq war. Remember, we were told it would be a cake walk. Oil revenue would pay for it. Result? Thousands dead, many more seriously wounded. Cost? Trillions. I echo your hatred!!
3407 2018-01-18 16:53:12 @KLM just get airplane ran out of oil in the air !!!  surly going to fly with you again it’s a perfect suicide plan ! #kLM #worst #airlines

3409 2018-01-18 16:52:48 How about videos of new oil rigs and strip mines going into public lands?

3411 2018-01-18 16:52:29 That new company had better not screw with the Crunch bar recipe!  No replacing cocoa with oil, like Hershey did.  
3412 2018-01-18 16:52:25 I crushed a dude with Oil Rogue and it felt wonderful.
3413 2018-01-18 16:52:23 Interesting, if guidelines recommend low fat, and people follow and eat low fat, then fats are  added in the cooking/eating stage more than the raw or processing stages. Eg buy low fat meat, cook it in canola oil stops burning, eat with a oiled salad?
3414 2018-01-18 16:52:20 Man what the fuck will a sex robot squirt? Fucking oil
3415 2018-01-18 16:52:19 Try CBD oil. My friend is the same way and CBD has changed his life.

3417 2018-01-18 16:51:42 When will Republicans realize that Americans don’t want war, tax cuts for wealthy, threats to health care, and oil industry giveaways? War! War! War! It’s bullshit! Thought we were moving on from that. WAR IS SWAMP. @realDonaldTrump
3418 2018-01-18 16:51:33 Rosehip oil declined to interview.
3419 2018-01-18 16:51:33 Dude mix it w avocado oil and omg you'll notice a difference in a week
3420 2018-01-18 16:51:25 Someone should start a rumour the the US has a massive oil deposit so the US military goes to war with itself, topples it's own government, bombs itself, guns itself down and then claims to have had a flawless victory and saved millions of lives
3421 2018-01-18 16:51:21 Oil price in $/barrel has hit highest price in 2.5 years. Great for economy, terrible for us.

3423 2018-01-18 16:51:13 Sold Norwegian Oil DETNF & LNDNF after huge & Good gains to buy SQM today.

Inheritance coming in a month plus. Do you think Li market will be down that long ?

Alternative is to sell more today, buy SQM and buy back w/ inheritance $

Thoughts ?
3424 2018-01-18 16:50:56 @ReformedBroker would you care to comment on the continued huge draws of oil in the face of the supposedly significant US supply growth. The 1st qtr is seasonally the best qtr for inventory builds. Oddly, your colleagues at @CNBC are deciding not to even report it this week.
3425 2018-01-18 16:50:55 I swear my face has never felt so hydrated/ clear! I’ve really gotten into essential oils and by far lemongrass mixed with coconut oil is the best and my favorite combo ever!!!

3431 2018-01-18 16:50:19 DAMN the avocado oil too!? I’ve found a body butter to be the most beneficial. I mix it with a lil almond oil and it’s great

3436 2018-01-18 16:49:19 Oh ok...i wanted d coconut oil, i only get it each time i travel to d villa and thats like once in 2-3yrs
3437 2018-01-18 16:49:12 Brazil built @petrobras since 1953 and it still functions effectively as the leading global oil company, why dont we argue in that line. Market fundamentalist approach is not the way to go, but state capacity to show the political will to do what is right.

3440 2018-01-18 16:49:03 The car ran like shit suddenly halfway between oil changes and that was three oil changes ago. Never did the dipstick before then because car ran perfectly. You can’t see the oil on the ground remember, it’s a burning issue. No blue smoke either. Subtle.

3447 2018-01-18 16:47:58 We need it for disabled, elderly, and those working who still can't afford basic expenses. People who are actively looking for jobs who've been laid off or terminated. If you can afford diamonds, gold, designer clothes and shoes and a luxury car, you don't need welfare
3448 2018-01-18 16:47:55 When your oil change cost $52.01 but you only got $45.96 in your account
3449 2018-01-18 16:47:48 That he does. He is a snake oil salesmen. Full of shit. Orange shit.

3476 2018-01-18 16:44:07 True but the fact is it hurts us the least of all 20 clubs in the PL. Every single other club has a higher ratio, we can afford mistakes & what's more it's our earned money. Not oil etc.
3477 2018-01-18 16:43:51 probably bringing products with micro beads ,  or ones with palm oil in , would annoy me ' more '  #PalmOil #Microbeads

3489 2018-01-18 16:42:40 Because oil men consider it ancient graffiti, and we all know only thugs make graffiti.
3490 2018-01-18 16:42:35 Seems like the suvs are a minor part of the problem. Suing the oil giants seems like a very good trade off for the earth.

Anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-bacterial
Makes your coat shiny
And if the hoomans put it on their skin, it will also absorb into the bloodstream and do them all sorts of good too
3502 2018-01-18 16:40:27 Quite thoughtful though, while you await the car, you can get other stuff like brake oil, fire extinguisher and extra tyre.

3522 2018-01-18 16:37:26 The tip of a teaspoon of ccoconut oil into your ear and patiently wait for it to start making a sound in your ear. It's ticklish and you'll feel like popping your ear, wait for it to settle down and it'll pop on its own. Worked for me.

3533 2018-01-18 16:36:40 Coconut oil just doesn’t do it for me. I’ll be ashy within hours of using it.
3534 2018-01-18 16:36:36 It just sticks to the roof of your mouth and chokes you like curdled palm oil. I choose life, please.

3541 2018-01-18 16:35:37 "Green" is "local" in many cases. Solar panels on roofs vs. centralized utilities; if you charge your electric car with PV cells, you weaken oil companies.

3551 2018-01-18 16:34:26 What difference does it make if the oil is warm or cold tho
3552 2018-01-18 16:34:15 World bank lending globally to upstream oil and gas was $240 million last year. That's about 0.5% of the total capex in Alberta. That's hardly a bellwether.
3553 2018-01-18 16:34:04 Thanks to @primrosebakery for the recipe though I do tweak it and use sunflower rather than vegetable oil plus I don’t use nuts but sometimes add seeds.  Hmmm .... rocky road

3559 2018-01-18 16:33:33 Knowing Trump, that's probably oil they're spraying not water.
3560 2018-01-18 16:33:28 I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to pour cooking oil on a baking tray before checking whether or not it has holes.

Turns out it did and all the oil leaked out. Well done to me

3567 2018-01-18 16:32:21 I understand your point, but is there another method of transporting oil that is safer?
3568 2018-01-18 16:32:07 Safest for whom? Oil, gas, and coal?

3578 2018-01-18 16:31:31 Still a fairly muted reaction here for $OIL despite posting a 6.9 million barrel draw compared to the 5 year avg build of 1.6 million barrels (+ biggest Cushing draw on record). Longs outnumber shorts here by almost 15 to 1 (record low short interest) and markets getting cautious
3579 2018-01-18 16:31:27 I get the oil changed in my car when:
3580 2018-01-18 16:31:20 You lie ,worry more about oil prices ,which were stable under President Barack Obama # but since you got in have been going up,talk about that dumb fuck,since you like to take credit...

3584 2018-01-18 16:30:52 They are a charity case! Funded by oil money! 
3585 2018-01-18 16:30:45 I'm asking about the oil spill.

3592 2018-01-18 16:30:19 I think I haven’t had any eczema on my body this winter because I basically dip myself in oil, but I avoid oils on my face because I am quite oily

Thou hast prepared in my sight a table, against them that trouble me;  thou hast fatted my head with oil;
3600 2018-01-18 16:29:09 How about you run an unnecessary Canadian oil pipeline along the top of the entire wall and when it leaks all over, it will be too disgusting and slick for anyone to climb over it!
3601 2018-01-18 16:29:03 my family is also involved in oil business, so lets hope oil prices keep going up

3619 2018-01-18 16:27:56 Hmnnn, I don't think that's a correct assessment. Just think,a person in Kim 's position(after UN sanctions on oil) would have acted 5times Kim.Yet he opted into the Russian chess style.He must be cheating& diverting.Tillerson shows America isn't  fooled by recent Kim's games.
3620 2018-01-18 16:27:54 And thusly my car breaks down in a admirable display of fuel and oil everywhere.

3935 2018-01-18 15:57:46 Shipping shortage. New supply coming on stream, rail committed to grain shipping instead of oil, Canadian storage rapidly filling. The kind of problems everyone has been predicting for years, but West Coast pseudo economists have been pooh poohing. Well, it's here now.
3936 2018-01-18 15:57:43 I mean avocados, nuts, olive oil are all dominant in healthy fats. The rest are 50/50 and your processed foods and sauces are the worst. I try to use olive oil when cooking as a healthier substitute wherever possible.
3937 2018-01-18 15:57:38 Consumers - car drivers - in Europe never chose to run their cars on biofuels. Most don't even know their diesel is mixed with biofuels from palm oil. And they don't have a choice at the petrol station.
3938 2018-01-18 15:57:16 I have my dog on Hemp Oil from Adored Beast, I buy it at the pet store in GFW and it has reduced her shedding by atleast 90%, I no longer have to use my vacuum! Definitely worth it
3939 2018-01-18 15:57:10 Sometimes while I’m wandering through downtown Pittsburgh, I wonder what someone would think if they stole my bag only to discover there’s only an alka Seltzer, a DIY essential oil rollerball, and Kathy Griffin book inside. I’d track me down, give it back, and punch me.

3944 2018-01-18 15:56:16 Nice word salad, but I'll try and respond to it. We get vehicles from Mexico, about 74 billion worth, electrical machinery, 63 billion worth, 14 billion in oil and other mineral fuels, and 21 billion in agricultural products. 9.3 billion in pre fabricated buildings..  so a lot.

3949 2018-01-18 15:55:53 Friend A: Jeez! Why is peanut oil so damn expensive?

Friend B: Do you see how small peanuts are? They probably have to squeeze 1 million of them to make one bottle!!

Friend A:  Oh yeah!

3950 2018-01-18 15:55:45 You are wrong. First, it's not fuel. Second, when you already have a certain amount of X thing and you add it to new Y thing, the net result is less resources are used to make the product. Third, you can make plastic from just about any oil - it doesn't have to be fossil oil.

4009 2018-01-18 15:49:36 The pattern is not directly propositional.

4031 2018-01-18 15:47:26 The fact that it's nominally backed by oil does make it potentially worth more than existing cryptos. Of course, you'd have to trust the Venezuelan government to deliver on that promise. And then there's sanctions.

Avoid hot baths or too much dry heat. Constantly put gentle lotion (or baby oil) on the area. I can only use dove unscented stuff.
4076 2018-01-18 15:41:54 Trillions welfare to corporate welfare queens each year more than spent on military, Social Security each year - banks, oil, coal, cable, prescription drugs, Apple etc, electricity, etc. Pollution from coal, oil increases health care costs children with asthma. IMF Externalities
4077 2018-01-18 15:41:53 Try orbé gold lust. They have a great shampoo and conditioner and an oil that’s really good for your hair. I started using it a few months back and can tell a huge difference. It’s a little more expensive but totally worth it!
4078 2018-01-18 15:41:49 Yo voté a Macri ,otra vez aumentó el gas oil y yo lo uso para laburar,no me alcanza la guita ni me dan los números, puso uno...pelotudoooooooo

4080 2018-01-18 15:41:21 They're stylish work boots that have oil stains on them and smell like an ash tray
4081 2018-01-18 15:41:16 But how would it affect the price of oil?
4082 2018-01-18 15:41:13 Honestly just black seed oil and apple cider vinegar at night. But I'm gonna go to GNC today and get on that. Refocusing on how I used to ia my Goal. You recommend anything ?

4100 2018-01-18 15:39:58 Is oil better in the air or in the water?  Because everyone we take it out of the ground it ends up in one of those places. #OILSpill
4101 2018-01-18 15:39:28 no need to drill for more oil except to expand oil profits-better jobs could be created investing in wind/solar

4132 2018-01-18 15:36:06 To all the NYC citizens who voted for de Blasio, seek help.  He wants government funding as a sanctuary city and is suing oil companies for climate change.  Haven't seen a racketeer that bold since I first learned about the money changers in the temple in Sunday school.
4133 2018-01-18 15:36:04 Another idea could be like a oil spill trap to slow down people and you can place it on one floor peace.
4134 2018-01-18 15:35:57 If you apply it 2 just the oil, maybe. However, that's unlikely & the consensus among skincare ppl is that it dries out/irritates your skin, making your acne worse. I suggest a hot washcloth against the zit, followed by cool water, then witch hazel extract & a light moisturizer.
4135 2018-01-18 15:35:49 Chef, Marcus Samuelsson, never buys products with palm oil in because of the adverse effect it has on rainforests. What conscious changes have you made to your #diet as a result of an #environmental awareness?

4142 2018-01-18 15:34:33 I find it humorous that the bears on oil are saying the exact same things when oil moves higher that the oil bulls of 2014 said as oil went lower.. “not driven by fundamentals, the paper market is 30x larger then the physical, speculative positioning is driving this move”.. #OOTT
4143 2018-01-18 15:34:16 It's a random thought, but it occurred to me while watching a documentary on the creation of the modern Arab states that most of the imperial wars since 1914 at least have centred on securing control of strategic oil resources, particularly in the Middle East and elsewhere.

4175 2018-01-18 15:30:26 So you're willing to just dump our 3rd largest trade partner. That's real dumb. Look it up. We get a lot more from Mexico than oil and avocados. They aren't paying for the wall, no matter what happens. We send them the bill, they jack up prices and we are stuck with it.

4184 2018-01-18 15:29:36 Sorry, but that's totally wrong. OPEC works by agreement to limit the quantity of oil each state sells. AKA, agreeing to HODL the rest. It's exactly the same strategy as BTC owners agreeing to limit the quantity each sells (because what is HODLed is by definition not sold)

4216 2018-01-18 15:26:36 Worth asking: who would be paying that 0.5T USD every year? It's roughly an order of magnitude more than oil company profits cleared each year. Food for thought.. Thanks for sharing the article

4224 2018-01-18 15:25:43 Possibly even more perverse than wars for oil are wars to keep bankers rich and in control of the world.

If "our" banking system breaks the last few countries around the world who defy them, do you think they are going to start treating the rest of us BETTER?

4256 2018-01-18 15:21:31 E471 is listed as stabiliser on the pack. I would never have thought that could be palm oil, especially as peanut oil is listed separately. You'd assume it was the only oil. Shocked!

4265 2018-01-18 15:20:40 You are right! @asda provide value with their veg oil but it's what is in the bottle that counts. Cold pressed rapeseed oil (often found in a glass bottle with fancy label!) means that it has been pressed in a natural, chemical free way and ensures all the goodness is retained.
4266 2018-01-18 15:20:35 Soak some cotton gauze in oil of clove. Roll it up and bite down firmly with the affected tooth. Should bring relief quickly and for a few hours

4287 2018-01-18 15:18:06 I assume you're Iranian? I ask you to look at Iran's oil revenue for the 2016/17 year where Iran was no longer under sanctions and Iran's share of the market reached before sanctions figure. It and oil revenue and this doesn't take into account  the sales costs was only $41B.

4375 2018-01-18 15:06:43 What "devastates our military" is unrelenting military deployments w/usual risks & sacrifices to accomplish nothing WH can be specific about. OIL & POPPY-FIELDS? 1% of FILTHY RICHEST profit by those things. American Heroes are used to get that for them. Tax $$ keep scam going.

4377 2018-01-18 15:06:29 It destroyed many lives in Vietnam, just to prevent the elected communist government in Vietnam. 

In Iraq the US stole the oil, destroyed the country, put a puppet in power, created ISIS by pulling out, and made the country pay for the rebuilding by US companies like Halliburton
4378 2018-01-18 15:06:23 This is old news. Ask Iranians about how they connect the United States of America to democracy since the 1953 CIA / MI6 coup of Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh over oil.

4499 2018-01-18 14:53:53 #OOTT | #OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report : 2018 global oil demand expected at 98.51mbd. #WTI #Brent
4500 2018-01-18 14:53:42 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
4501 2018-01-18 14:53:26 腹痛いの収まって
4502 2018-01-18 14:53:12 at 4 in the morning, the shelf in my bathroom that holds all my skincare products fell off the wall, waking me up and scaring me!, and two of my glass bottles of serum/oil broke :(
4503 2018-01-18 14:53:09 i was in art working on my oil pastel landscape and i said “i don’t like how this is turning out” and my friend said “i think it looks good” and my other friend said “oh god what did you do”
4504 2018-01-18 14:53:09 Sa dami ng pangyayari, parang gusto ko nalang mag diffuse ng oil at kumain ng pop corn. Ang saya lang! #PhilippinePolitics #Rappler
4505 2018-01-18 14:53:04 Oil follow me....please
4506 2018-01-18 14:52:59 They know nothing about real moisture.
Immerse me in the depths of the atlantic and then give me a diet of exclusively shea butter and oil, then maybe I'll stop flaking for 10 minutes.
4507 2018-01-18 14:52:48 Yes! Coconut oil & green tea serum
4508 2018-01-18 14:52:38 結構捨てたのにまだまだ ものがいっぱいある。日曜日引っ越し準備仕上げよう
4509 2018-01-18 14:52:23 I wonder why you never show any glorious Man City videos before oil money 
4510 2018-01-18 14:52:20 They are defending their... oil.
4511 2018-01-18 14:52:14 I Need To Call And Make A Appt For A Oil Change
4512 2018-01-18 14:52:10 put olive oil and salt in my iv
4513 2018-01-18 14:52:07 The way my car drives after an oil change >
4514 2018-01-18 14:52:05 It's our favorite! It helps extend the life of our hairstyle by absorbing the oil and buildup from our roots :)
4515 2018-01-18 14:51:58 Glad to see a president that cares about America rather than oil. #TrumpTrain hope he pulls a Roservelt #3Terms
4516 2018-01-18 14:51:51 勉強始めようと思ったらデスマ太郎始まりますやん
4517 2018-01-18 14:51:45 True, but shantipriya samuday ka epicentre thoda-thoda Bharat me shift hota ja rha he, mujhe lagta he ki yadi arab me oil vilupt ho bhi gya to Bharatiya upmahadweep ke musalman apne hi dhan se atanwad ki funding kre, tab tak ye log Bharat me almost 20-22% ho hi jayenge.

4523 2018-01-18 14:50:52 Try tea tree oil! And just keep washing it and let it run its course! Those are the worst 
4524 2018-01-18 14:50:47 YUP ran out of oil last night in the ole homestead!
4525 2018-01-18 14:50:18 You're in dream, oil prices are going up today it was $ 62 per Barrell, mid of 2017 it was $ 45 per Barrell.
4526 2018-01-18 14:50:10 Coconut oil dried up too fast and didn't absorb much. I have an oil face then dry skin all over my body.. I need something richer and more absorbent
4527 2018-01-18 14:50:08 Marianna Párraga  @mariannaparraga
The most recent symptom of the poor condition of Venezuela's oil industry is an acute brain drain due to very low (I should say ridiculous) salaries
4528 2018-01-18 14:50:05 In the past 23 years China has built 16,000 miles of high speed rail. The United States, 0. We are drilling for oil in the ocean. There is a reason the world no longer approves of American leadership. The GOP thinks the future of the United States looks like Saudi Arabia.
4529 2018-01-18 14:50:02 หือออ....เก็บกลิ่นด้วยนะจ้ะฟุ้งทะลุโทรศัพท์เชียว
4530 2018-01-18 14:50:02 It’s incredulous! Eddy was out digging ditches fgs! It is not hard to understand why he is popular with his constituents, 75 pieces of chicken is not the reason! MSM in NL have got to do better when this is news. An oil rig was  stopped over s TEN month old unreported incident.
4531 2018-01-18 14:49:59 yup I ran out of home heating oil last night!  grrrrrrrrr
4532 2018-01-18 14:49:56 Oh Really? You an expert? But you're kinda right, the US should be under crippling world sanctions and Bush, Cheney etc should be in jail for lying to the UN, the Iraq invasion and stealing its oil wealth. But it isn't.
4533 2018-01-18 14:49:47 No shock, oil as the next (only) big thing here has drawn lots of folks, like Mecca, but we could be facing a murky dawn.
4534 2018-01-18 14:49:32 Hahaha. We downed a big bag between us (chips in coconut oil with himalayan salt, omg soooo good!) last night. I was only 4.0 when we ate them, so I took 4 units of bolus (Humalog) and did the job. Normally I'd take 8, if my bg was more than 6.5.
4535 2018-01-18 14:49:27 My 2 cents: Iran and Iraq compete for the same oil customers, and the  Baghdad-Tehran deal is purely political, to help Baghdad skirt Kurdistan; direct access to global markets works, better economically for Iraq than having to go through Iran
4536 2018-01-18 14:49:08 Looks like an oil paint
4537 2018-01-18 14:49:06 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
4538 2018-01-18 14:49:00 Interested in #oil politics in Iraq? #PipeDreams by @ErinBanco is out Jan. 29

@mike_giglio: "The book offers a unique and timely window onto the country's tumultuous past, as well as a lens for understanding the instability and violence that continue to plague it today."
4539 2018-01-18 14:48:59 I’ll take 6 spoons of oil please
4540 2018-01-18 14:48:54 I'm not sure about other brands but this one is scentless. Like zilch zero nada. I love that it's fast absorbing too, unlike coconut oil which I was using for two years. Yet to see if it's better though
4541 2018-01-18 14:48:42 痛い痛い痛い
4542 2018-01-18 14:48:30 いや腹痛すぎるやろ何やいきなり
4543 2018-01-18 14:48:28 That is great we can't fund oil wars and secret black ops projects against the people of the USA. Remember for the people by the people.

4547 2018-01-18 14:47:52 I heard Cannabis Essential Oil (hemp based so no THC effects) is helpful.
4548 2018-01-18 14:47:50 Not so fast @QuicoToro : "This week, the state oil company’s new chief, National Guard Gen. Manuel Quevedo...said production has stabilized and will grow to 2.5 million barrels per day this year."  I mean....it's a plan!!    The rest is just bureaucratic details.
4549 2018-01-18 14:47:43 When the oil light comes on in my mom's car she calls me and says "Alladin's lamp is on what do I do?"

4551 2018-01-18 14:47:33 2007-2008 crude oil to 140 and corn to 6

food/energy inflation really hurts the consumer

4553 2018-01-18 14:47:18 If the government can bail out big oil companies for billions of dollars why can't they bail me out for a few hundred I am struggling
4554 2018-01-18 14:47:14 Oil spill off China coast now the size of Paris
4555 2018-01-18 14:47:02 Everyone blamed his forex policy and other poorly thought out policies for investors checking out of the economy.
Oil prices are back up, banks made mad money through T-bills last year so the investors are back.
Did Buhari drive up oil prices or if the NSE slumps next year,
4556 2018-01-18 14:47:02 Haha, nice! We do make a beard dry oil which is our take on a beard balm. Not sure yet if Animated will be available as a dry oil or not.
4557 2018-01-18 14:46:48 i put way too much coconut oil on my face....
4558 2018-01-18 14:46:45 Lol na mehe ni tirhile tea tree oil diluted with witch hazel and rose water from xoho xitolo lexiya. Ani ngari na Afro lover, it's always been short hair or long relaxed hair
4559 2018-01-18 14:46:39 US Opening prices: #DOW -0.04% #NASDAQ -0.12% #Ftse100 -0.52% #GBPUSD 1.388 #EURGBP 0.8824 #EURUSD 1.2248 #Gold -0.65% #Oil -0.31%
4560 2018-01-18 14:46:39 It's awesome to go back in time like this.  I love oil rogue again.
4561 2018-01-18 14:46:27 Now that the #PIGB is passed, hope we can move forward and have a better oil sector
4562 2018-01-18 14:46:20 tweeps...how old can expired vitamins, fish oil, etc is too old to, you know, take them? (these suckers are expensive, yo!)

4564 2018-01-18 14:45:46 Combine 4 tsps caviar with 8 oz kingfish. Add Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with love.
4565 2018-01-18 14:45:25 From what I understand of the keto diet... you basically just eat coconut oil all the time?

4567 2018-01-18 14:45:17 Ok recipe is ...Take a pan...Put oil as you want .I keep adding a wide chunks  then put onion, capsicums, peas, caraat nd other vegetables

4571 2018-01-18 14:44:46 Im not vegan but you can make your own pesto using sesame seeds, bell pepper, vegan parmesan, olive oil, and a bit of avacado, sundried tomatoe and lotssss of chilli flakes and some parsley. Blend it night before. In morning spread on seeded brown bread
4572 2018-01-18 14:44:42 Check with @purpleline as to the range of price for oil.
4573 2018-01-18 14:44:18 Get oil
4574 2018-01-18 14:44:17 Hmm, well then I guess a bunch of people without beards have been buying the oil.  Maybe as gifts for the beards in their lives...
4575 2018-01-18 14:44:11 I’ve lived in TX most of my life, drug free. TX jobs are high. Oil fields are booming. Not seeing the danger or fear you try to spread. More people are dying from the opioid crisis in the Midwest and East Coast.
4576 2018-01-18 14:44:09 Who said something about some oil...bitch you cooking...?
4577 2018-01-18 14:44:09 Here’s a product idea, instead of beard oil....stubble butter 
4578 2018-01-18 14:43:31 I think this is less about the friendliness of the NDP who are just reinvented PCs than about higher costs for the oil and gas industry. The good cheap stuff is gone so it just costs the industry more; sometimes it's not worth it. Even with subsidy.  The debt is a problem.#Abpoli
4579 2018-01-18 14:43:21 Fourth day of my Hiperrealim oil class.  Enjoy your day 
4580 2018-01-18 14:43:16 Liar. It is simple. NDP have made AB a no go zone for out of province capital investment. NDP apologists say Low oil prices = no oil investment.  Reality is NDP forced Total SA to crystallize massive losses & IRAN is now more politically certain than AB.
4581 2018-01-18 14:42:55 The currency?  Again ffs is that all they can come up with . Why not call the new Scottish currency the barrel as we have millions o barrels o oil stolen every day by westmonster.
4582 2018-01-18 14:42:43 @jimcramer Ge getting a tailwind with oil ?? All GE has done is gone DFS !!!!
4583 2018-01-18 14:42:36 @narendramodi @BJP4India @mygovindia @PMOIndia @abpnewstv @AmitShah sir @arunjaitley please bring oil prices under GST
4584 2018-01-18 14:42:34 It was so good. Coffee, 1 tbsp of coconut oil, 1 tbsp of kerrygold butter, and some cinnamon. I put it in a blender and then it was ready
4585 2018-01-18 14:42:15 Oh, he was just grandstanding. I'm sure he had to make the trip to reassure donors from the oil industry that, while he couldn't deliver drilling in Florida, he'd do everything he could to make sure they were never held accountable for the mess they make here.
4586 2018-01-18 14:42:13 A barrel of oil will always have some value. I am not so sure you can say that about a crypto currency.
4587 2018-01-18 14:42:00 Rose hip oil is WHERE IT'S AT, right? I thought it might be too heavy or clog pores, BUT NO. Just SOFT GLOWING SKIN ALL THE TIME.
4588 2018-01-18 14:41:59 Sorry so does my sister I wonder what’s in the oil
4589 2018-01-18 14:41:58 You and I both know how effective FFP is  I think there's the discussion on teams trying to buy the league but it applies to some teams more than others (your oil sheikh funded teams v teams which just have great commercial revenues)
4590 2018-01-18 14:41:48 The U.S. oil conglomerate has spoken.
4591 2018-01-18 14:41:47 Lalo silang magmumukhang dugyot pag naglagay ng make up hahahaha. Natural oil lang daw kailangan nila
4592 2018-01-18 14:41:47 Hi! Available ba Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil???

4597 2018-01-18 14:41:26 unlike oil can harry, youre an ugly old FART
4598 2018-01-18 14:40:54 Heavily reliant on price of oil. Last years close was really impressive and if things don't change it would get higher this year. I stand to be corrected.
4599 2018-01-18 14:40:49 RBC's top commodity strategist says she'd buy oil on any weakness.
4600 2018-01-18 14:40:44 Wait..........Millie Bobby Brown and Jacob Sartorius are dating??? That seems like oil and water to me.....I wonder if she wears his sweaaaaattttshirt..  ****air horn sound effect **dab dab dab
4601 2018-01-18 14:40:31 Exactly... Seeing as oil was at the highest...  I am yet to see any pattern there... Not even election year as some are tweeting... There was election in 2011 and 2015..
4602 2018-01-18 14:40:25 Most likely swapping parts you don't need to replace yet is what official mechanics would ask you to do. Changing oil isn't entirely limited to mileage if you're not using the car as often.
4603 2018-01-18 14:40:24 エルザに殴られたなう
4604 2018-01-18 14:40:21 Perfect timing for another Speros article, I needed to check my oil today.
4605 2018-01-18 14:40:21 Hailers be like
"Buhari has stabilized global oil price"
"Buhari has defeated Boko Haram but needs just $1b to bury them"
"Buhari has made me give birth to 12 children"
"Buhari has made Nigeria greatest economy worldwide"
"Buhari is fighting corruption"

4613 2018-01-18 14:39:33 Not talking about socialism what I'm talking about is the fact that Mexico is the third-largest trading partner with the US and in the top 4 for oil exports to the US Mexican standard of living should be near what Americans are and they're not
4614 2018-01-18 14:39:32 Yeah, I‘m aware just how unpopular that opinion would be once disseminated to the masses. Pitchforks, scalding oil, the works.
4615 2018-01-18 14:39:30 I used too much tea tree oil in my hair 
That stuff is STRONG
4616 2018-01-18 14:39:29 Now if only people cared about Canadian companies getting oil to market as they do Amazon... Canada might not be in so much trouble. #cndpoli
4617 2018-01-18 14:39:28 How does it smell? I'm looking for a new oil but I don't want to end up with that young oil scent

4620 2018-01-18 14:39:00 GM folks! SPX 2hr looks like a nice sideways consolidation and they're going to try and break it up again. We'll see. 2809.5 is line in sand. Bears need to defend. GOLD a little weakish but nothing major here and still waiting for OIL to break lower.
4621 2018-01-18 14:38:56 The president was slammed by opposition for its slump sha...  Nobody cared that oil price was at its lowest, Buhari was just incompetent to them. 
Let Buharist enjoy this time Biko.

4634 2018-01-18 14:37:23 That is possible. I don't know how to find the API gravity of oil in storage.
4635 2018-01-18 14:37:17 Y’all better get them oil changes lol they’re important 
4636 2018-01-18 14:37:10 Currently down <16>, holding #GPBUSD, #GBPJPY, #EURUSD.  I just pulled my CAD pending orders in advance of oil.
4637 2018-01-18 14:37:06 カホンってCajonって書くんだね！！

これってホホバオイルをJojoba Oilって書くのと同じですね！！

すごいなるほどー！！ってなってます

4639 2018-01-18 14:36:21 In all seriousness, would you walk up to a complete stranger on the beach sunbathing and ask her if you can oil her up? Would you do that and not expect her to tell you to go fuck yourself and probably find a police officer?

4643 2018-01-18 14:36:02 Im sorry. What part of corruption in Venezuela only started in 1999? None of it. Oil revenues aren't the cause of Venezuelas inflation issues. Address reality. Not bullshit distortions and deflections.

4942 2018-01-18 14:00:34 XRP can be used by anonyone. RippleNet uses it to improve settlements. Investors think that will drive demand so they want to profit from it.

People who buy commodies (i.e. oil) don't use oil either. That doesn't mean they are mislead. In fact, trading improves liquidity!

4991 2018-01-18 13:54:08 I may hate United but you are a way bigger club then City. And I have respect for you unlike City. The only reason they are at the top is oil money
4992 2018-01-18 13:54:07 Due to the fact that we are not a socialist country and our economy is not solely based on crude oil. I think it's very realistic that Americans will not have the same headlines.
4993 2018-01-18 13:53:46 I completely respect the military, and all service members.  However, mandatory service should not be required.  I don't need a child of mine going to fight in some oil barons war.  A draft if we're attacked?  Sure, otherwise, no way.
4994 2018-01-18 13:53:43 Hmmm... I haven't seen a lot of what you listed in action... so they are really your thoughts. Court orders are flaunted... corruption shouts in the oil sector... media clampdown... not to mention stagnant economy or continuous killing of citizens nationwide...
4995 2018-01-18 13:53:42 You would never oil your child, so why on earth would you oil your car?
4996 2018-01-18 13:53:42 Hi, it's because our fries are "boardwalk style" which means they're hand cut and washed, then double-fried skin-on in peanut oil. Apologies for the inconvenience.
4997 2018-01-18 13:53:40 you guys need to try Burt’s Bees products ! they are magical. i use their facial wash and scrub everyday , then use a liquid toner & finish out w a facial oil combination . we gotta always keep our skin hydrated and moisturized . that’ll help with acne a lot

5025 2018-01-18 13:50:14 Perhaps WORST OF ALL, is the FAKE PROMISE that "Fracking is safe" and the FAKE NEWS that "by extracting Natural Gas in America we are becoming less dependent on Foreign Oil." What lies. The GOP is "ruining OUR LAND" so they can PROFIT selling the "cheap gas" to Asia.

5026 2018-01-18 13:50:12 Wonder how Trump would feel about Africa if every diamond, every piece of gold, every barrel of oil, every acre of land that was stolen from those poor black people was returned to them. Bet he'd be kissing all those black behinds then wouldn't he......

5038 2018-01-18 13:48:42 Nepal has been occupied since the 50s, and the world keeps looking at the other side, obviously if they had oil, things would change. Geopolitics runs the world, before now and ever.

5045 2018-01-18 13:47:53 So, this morning with my lean beef roast and boiled eggs, I should have had sardines in olive oil rather than bacon. I felt the need for more fat but naturally chose bacon. I'll switch to sardines. Don't understand how omega 6 oils are good, though.

5047 2018-01-18 13:47:42 Herban UK attends Pig & Poultry North at Sand Hutton York. Pleased to see speakers highlighting the use of Oregano as management tool to reduce antibiotic use. Herban is a single oregano essential oil. Email : info@herban.co.uk
5048 2018-01-18 13:47:39 The smell of his black castor oil in my hair is gone make me vomit.. and i can still feel beer sitting on my stomach 
5049 2018-01-18 13:47:35 Venezuela fell because of the collapse of the global oil market. The USSR, Cuba and N. Korea are not socialist nations. Communism and socialism are not the same thing. 

It's good that you showed the world you have no idea what you are spouting about. #MAGA #Clueless
5050 2018-01-18 13:47:21 Boys who r asking their partners to send their nude photos or vids then after break up they will post it online just to win her back or ruin her life. Go to hell! Your balls deserve a boiling oil in a fry pan. Tangina niyo kahit popogi niyo. Nobody deserves ppl like you.
5051 2018-01-18 13:47:15 Home builders have the same problem that Oil companies did when Oil prices were over $100. High cost of material. and shortage of workers. By the time they meet all the needs out there the market will turn.

5079 2018-01-18 13:44:00 I once used the conditioner in a hotel only to find that it was scented with olive oil and almonds. For the rest of that day’s meetings I smelled like a delicious Italian dinner.

Men, women, children, dogs cats it doesn't matter. All because we weren't invited to NOKO/SOKO talks byChina/Russia!

You don't just stuck a pipe a ground and it gushes out 

A better analogy is a garden: data sources need to be planned, grown, looked after, weeded and harvested.

Also data  are more delicious
5089 2018-01-18 13:42:36 I wonder the extent to which this is fact-checked vs. just a reprinted press release? I don't know anything about oil, but that gas production number looks off to me...
5090 2018-01-18 13:42:33 The project needs stable collaterals tho for the future. Maybe Bitcoin, but also maybe assets linked to the real world: gold, silver, oil, etc.

5160 2018-01-18 13:32:45 Another thing Matt...although I agree with you that Fed isn't hitting the backhand as well...he still managed to hit a sweet looking 'oil painting' of a backhand on 3-4 occasions...especially when he broke Struff in the 2nd set...
5161 2018-01-18 13:32:36 I went for CBT about 10 years ago and I was told that bipolar was too severe to be treated. It terrifies me that a lot of snake oil and quackery is all that stands between life and death. No wonder suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of 45

5168 2018-01-18 13:31:28 What relevance is there to the kind of immigration of cheap labor we needed in the Steam Age or the Oil Age?  This is the Information Age and we don’t need an endless flow of uneducated workers.
5169 2018-01-18 13:31:08 And now govt employees need to live in fear of defaulting on their mortgages, student loans, + car payments or in fear of not being able to afford oil for their heat or food to eat. Because there’s no promise of backpay! All because you failed to get Mexico to pay for your wall
5170 2018-01-18 13:30:24 Sir it may interest you to know that he might have done this ifo some politicians as price for bigger oil deals. Some of these guys, especially those with accounts in tax havens help politicians move funds, in return for contracts or deals.

5187 2018-01-18 13:28:05 So like, not to be all "Coconut oil fixes everything" but I was asking my sister what shampoo she used for her dogs because they were so soft and she said she never bathed them but gave them coconut oil every day. I tried it with mine and it works wonders.

5196 2018-01-18 13:26:47 the relationship isn't continuous from my personal rsch. it's discrete kind of like oil & breakeven rates, investors only take notice of it once it goes through "psychological" thresholds. i think 3% would prompt a correction in NQ or at least stop it for a while

5210 2018-01-18 13:23:35 No rate cut. Inflation - short term looks good, but long term risks remain. Ratings downgrade, oil price and ZAR weigh on market

5216 2018-01-18 13:22:52 Original tweet mentioned OIL, so I referenced this government's own stats on tax revenue of oil.
What part of that don't you understand?
5217 2018-01-18 13:22:50 @JoeAndAlexShow , So the automotive industry is a scam but my fiancée is a mechanic who actually went to college an me having been in the dealership industry. ANY SUV ABOVE 2005 Does need SYNTHETIC OIL! It’s has to do with the tolerance of the vehicle.
5218 2018-01-18 13:22:44 @JoeAndAlexShow I only do synthetic oil changes for my car. They're both Hondas and you can go longer miles before an oil change. I only get them done at Indy Honda. I pay about $60 but I find a coupon online for $10 off from Vavoline

5221 2018-01-18 13:22:20 Wow, maybe you should use an oil more suited to cold weather?  Or maybe find something to preheat the oil?

5227 2018-01-18 13:21:48 Yes, the US space program is the cause homelessness.   Meanwhile, they only receive 0.4% of the federal budget.   But let’s go after those actually advancing science & not the oil & gas subsidies.   Not to mention the contributions from NASA to our society have been vast & great.
5228 2018-01-18 13:21:46 Maybe the reason is their cultural homogeneity? Not everyone enjoys diversity, despite media orders. Maybe the reason is the northern lights and the fjords?  They got those too! Or maybe it's because it's a wildly wealthy country due to their oil:population ratio???
5229 2018-01-18 13:21:44 Act of War had 3 income streams. The primary one was oil. You build a refinery, and an oil derrick, and oil tankers then drive between them.

The secondary income streams were Banks (by garrisoning them), and Prisoners of War (a full PoW camp produces phat stacks of moolah)

5241 2018-01-18 13:20:35 @JoeAndAlexShow I didn’t hear the beginning but we have a Nissan Altima that we take to the dealership and an oil change there is $35ish. I have never in my life paid more than $40 for an oil change that is absolutely ridiculous. What did they do that warranted $112? #wtf #scam
5242 2018-01-18 13:20:19 That "river" can be waded across.

5248 2018-01-18 13:19:16 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
5249 2018-01-18 13:19:14 That did make me snicker. Funnier still because the left keeps telling us that drilling for oil in the arctic will decimate wildlife numbers. It has only helped the caribou.

5264 2018-01-18 13:17:53 @JoeAndAlexShow 1st time I went to get my oil changed by myself I fell for that crap and got the synthetic oil, then next time I went they told me I couldn’t go back to regular. I was pissed. #whataripoff

5347 2018-01-18 13:06:23 So what? They're different countries with different economies and import/export regimes. Venezuela has been pretty much solely reliant on oil, even with the previous oligarchical regime, so the oil glut would have hit their only source of income, no matter who was in charge.

5471 2018-01-18 12:44:15 I see, so he's planning to make the UK entirely dependent on oil revenue and therefore extremely vulnerable to fluctuating prices. Who knew? It certainly wasn't in the manifesto.

5473 2018-01-18 12:44:07 So is it the government that made the oil price climb to $70? . That’s how much you lack achievements to put up. It rained here today, government is working! 
5474 2018-01-18 12:44:05 They’ll pay. He always said they wouldn’t cut us a check...we can tax money being sent to Mexico. My personal favorite is pay two dollars per barrel of oil that we buy from Mexico. Get with the program dude. Trumps the most transparent president ever. Yet u freaks don’t listen

The method applied now will not fuse the old layer and new layer. Its like mixing water with oil.
5483 2018-01-18 12:43:06 When making fries at home, to get perfect results:

- add salt after the frying

5495 2018-01-18 12:40:45 No, it's not. Palm oil is used because of its performance. In numbers: in the same space, palm produces 7/10 times more oil than any other plant. So, now, in the exact same place where palm was grown, they destroying 10 times more forest to produce the exact same amount of oil

5754 2018-01-18 12:01:08 After the discovery of oil in Turkana, the Jubilee regime has always tried to pocket the dignity of @GovernorNanok The governor. Upto date, there is less for Kenyans to know on the progress of its extraction.
5755 2018-01-18 12:01:06 My Greek Olive Oil soap just arrived. Yay! Greeks for centuries used olive oil for that sort of thing. There's the ruins of an old soap factory on the waterfront in Plomari. Ingesting it is a relatively new thing :)
5756 2018-01-18 12:01:05 He mentioned OIL. 
I Pointed out how much tax revenue it generates, which as I pointed out is £ 27.5 billion  going to Westminster.
£27.5 billion would come in very handy in an independent Scotland.

5768 2018-01-18 11:59:45 Actually the only comparable market is Forex. Corn doesn't trade for oil directly. If you think any coin or coins are overvalued. They're creating artificially high purchasing power for their trading pairs as well.

5797 2018-01-18 11:54:46 “Longer term reimbursement”? This double talk just tries to hide your idea to have the U.S. taxpayer pay billions for your idiotic “wall” and then raise tariffs on Mexican imports like oil, food, and cars/parts which will raise OUR prices for everyday goods!

5882 2018-01-18 11:45:01 No. Saudi is the world’s lowest cost oil producer, and that’s how they have been able to price competitors out of the market for the last 2 years. No amount of offshore oil rigs will make a difference in price. OPEC decides whether to produce enough to put them out of business.

5885 2018-01-18 11:44:39 Every student has to eat ramen at some point. That’s just a fact. Teaspoon Chinese chili oil, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and a splash of rice wine mixed into a 40p packet turns it into something approaching an actual meal.

6022 2018-01-18 11:23:39 Congratulations Nigerians!

#PIGB has finally received the legislative approval 

We need to prioritize the work that the @NGRSenate and the @HouseNGR has done on the #PIGB, because it would address the issues that lead to fuel scarcity and correct several crisis in oil sector.

6024 2018-01-18 11:23:36 Nigerian government ought to have built refineries, the money is there why wait for Aliko Dangote to build. A country that export crude oil shouldn't be importing fuel. I don't know if am the only one thinking this.
6025 2018-01-18 11:23:17 Wenger's legacy was severely altered by corrupt oligarch & unfettered oil money so yeah, he's not a fan of Chelsea/City.

6134 2018-01-18 11:06:30 Turkey - CBRT leaves rates unchanged. Not a surprise, but another opportunity to prove it’s metal on the monetary policy front lost. TRY still vulnerable while oil prices are high and rising, and current account deficit widening.

6137 2018-01-18 11:05:40 OPEC and Russia's oil pact may be working too well With oil prices rising, it could prompt US shale producers to come back in
As oil prices continue to rise, a fresh jolt in US production could just spoil all of OPEC's "hard work" in capping production over six months.

6154 2018-01-18 11:03:15 Trouble is, people in London have become so accustomed to these rip off prices and superficial staging that they cannot see what poor value they are facing. As for snake oil salesmen estate agents...

6188 2018-01-18 10:57:29 I concur. The norwegian government's view on oil operations in vulnerable zones is thankfully not reflected in the genereal view of the populace, although most norwegians are not willing to cut in production and the loss of living standard it might entail.
6189 2018-01-18 10:57:28 I have 105 oil palm samples, 3 time points of sampling which means 35 palms per sampling.

6191 2018-01-18 10:56:29 I've been right on $oil call since calling bottom at 30
called for 60 when it was in the 40s while the so called experts like $gs, EAI, non-stop downgrades and Cramer bashing.
right again called for 65 after it reached 60 

now I think 60 to be tested after option expiration 1/22

6481 2018-01-18 09:53:57 Everyone questioning @Alexis_Sanchez ‘s contract should realise if the highest earners in Europe don’t give out bumper contracts then who will? Credit Cards funded by Oil? The deal cost @ManUtd less than VVD cost Pool. Fathom that!
6482 2018-01-18 09:53:43 All the media talk about Sanchez deal to United is plain and simple jealousy at the highest level. Jealous of the richest club in the world who generates its own money to buy players. Not oil money from across the road who can’t generate enough to buy conference players.

6522 2018-01-18 09:46:08 Agreed. As an oil worker, it's the main issue that has driven me towards wanting independence. Norway with a similar population and less oil reserves sits with over one trillion in the bank. Meanwhile we are mired in debt that we didn't even borrow.

6538 2018-01-18 09:41:28 The oil tanks have been there for over 50 or 60 years to my knowledge.

What’s your point? That existing regs too lax? Walk or electric cars only? Oil pipelines exist because consumers demand oil use ie gasoline or diesel. Without consumers demanding it they would not produce it.

6554 2018-01-18 09:38:22 Yes, it's correct that why NNPC has been the sole importer of PMS since October 2017 bcos it can afford to bear such huge amounts as operating loss bcos they also generate more revenue from higher crude oil price.
6555 2018-01-18 09:38:13 I can see why. He worked hard for many years to put himself and the club in a position where they could compete financially in a self-sustainable way. Then, just when that was happening, a team with limitless oil money appear.
6556 2018-01-18 09:38:08 It'll be as disgraceful as arming the Saudis if the nomadic, secular Tuareg - who are fighting only for an independent homeland in Azawad - are suppressed in the course of defeating Islamic extremists in Mali.

6575 2018-01-18 09:33:52 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

6577 2018-01-18 09:33:44 With our exchange rate, the price of oil it's unsustainable. Unfortunately politicians play politics with the truth and when masses fall for it it enables fraud. A workable solution is preferential exchange rate. It will make fraud manageable and ensure low price of fuel.

6580 2018-01-18 09:32:41 We don't need to dig oil do we? Also OT is never empty like a certain other stadium in the city. Even on non-match days 100s visit OT...
6581 2018-01-18 09:32:16 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.
6582 2018-01-18 09:32:10 also PSA oil painting doesn’t have to be toxic, Acrylic is actually more harmful bc of polymers and chemicals which are carcinogens 
6583 2018-01-18 09:31:53 That's it. And then Goodall's started doing  very small bottle of what I reckon was pomace oil (old and oxidised) around 1977.

6594 2018-01-18 09:30:15 Canada has a network of 830,000 km of oil & gas pipelines and they're very intact servicing the whole nation, but here in Nigeria you can't even lay 1 km pipeline without one bastard human being vandalizing it all in the name of making quick money & yet we'd blame the government!
6595 2018-01-18 09:30:04 That 7m thing can be worked around using image rights for the player as well as a huge signing on bonus I presume. Both categories of 'extra' where we are no match for the oil money or the United money minting juggernaut. Sadly, we stay in our lane.

Ghana Govt is fixated on chopping money from oil & gold.

A serious govt that relies on INCOME TAXES would HAVE monthly/periodic DATA on unemployment bcos INCOME TAX is more important than OIL/GOD Lotto win-which's what's going on.

7114 2018-01-18 07:26:36 I agree with that.
Question. Do you not see the absurdity in who Trump has appointed? They're all the antithesis of the department they're heading. Besides, he said drain the swamp and then brought in the swampiest of the swamp. Big oil, big Pharma, Wall Street, unqualified.
7115 2018-01-18 07:26:34 i fried these potstickers at 2 am and theyre v good but now i have oil on myself and thats tragic
7116 2018-01-18 07:26:09 There's an extra seat or we'll just go in your car I'll get the oil changed
7117 2018-01-18 07:26:05 You can get ORS argan oil and argan pil hair food from clicks.  They are R10 and R14 respectively and they really last long. 

Out of all the oils that I have used I have realised that Argan oil is good for softening hair and they make it manageable to do whatever with it...
7118 2018-01-18 07:25:43 Things can only get you if you let em. Oil and water will never mix. This is universal law that will never change. Bad can never get you if you're good. But if you do something bad then they get happy!

7120 2018-01-18 07:24:45 You do realize palenstine sits in the middle of an oil rich region surrounded by wealthy countries, right?!!...why do they need a handout from America? Perhaps, they should knock on their neighbors door!......, besides, they've no desire for peace, just dominance.

7123 2018-01-18 07:23:59 I do too! The vitamin e oil has a sweet smell. It’s good for scars or can replenish your skin. I use mostly on my face because of acne scars.

7144 2018-01-18 07:18:48 What happens when the oil runs out and the government can no longer afford to pay for everything? Starvation and genocide....Thankfully, Norway has a more aggressively market based economy than the US. Unfortunately, most of that is gov't driven. It's only a matter of time.

7247 2018-01-18 07:00:22 Do not bring blind emotional reactivity into trading. Like oil and water, they don't mix well together.
7248 2018-01-18 07:00:06 That's where the grounnut oil and Vaseline comes in.. There is always a way out of every situation mehn
7249 2018-01-18 06:59:16 My other guesses are that (a) is like a Star Trek style replicator, (b) is a bottle of olive oil, (d) is a coffee cup, and (e) is an air hockey table.

7252 2018-01-18 06:58:52 It's the oil, it's probably changed to the nasty "power fry" oil that is blended with silicone to prevent full fryers from foaming out.
7253 2018-01-18 06:58:48 bio oil’s first ingredient is mineral oil and nobody should be putting that on their skin
jojoba and tea tree are the only ones that truly work
rosehip seed oil does WONDERS too
and too much jojoba can break you out so be careful
7254 2018-01-18 06:58:34 I just saw that peppermint oil in cotton balls are good to get rid of ratas! So I’m gonna go buy some mf peppermint oil tomorrow and throw peppermint balls all over my house!

7260 2018-01-18 06:57:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
7261 2018-01-18 06:57:31 I'd rather watch Andrew Bolt and Mark Latham wrestle in cottonseed oil... eWW...
7262 2018-01-18 06:57:29 As the price of crude oil continue to increase in the global market there is no how the landing cost of PMS can be less than 145 NAIRA per litre so far our refineries are not functioning. @MBuhari must be sincere with  Nigerians.
7263 2018-01-18 06:56:54 Tsala coconut oil works best especially the oderless one... Keep hair moisturised and was it weekly

Wigs help a lot with heat to grow it
7264 2018-01-18 06:56:31 I love you using oil paint  King of every medium
7265 2018-01-18 06:56:24 Well, it should go back to 17,000 sooner than later. It's like crude oil. They are playing with futures before the expiry dates of the contracts and with bitcoin is much more easier.

7273 2018-01-18 06:54:20 Apple cidar vinegar , black soap (its harsh on ur skin tho so only use it until your dark marks clear), bentonite clay, lemon essential oil. It takes time so don’t expect immediate results.

7286 2018-01-18 06:51:36 Fusion GPS wrote the slimy yellow journalism behind the chaos in Venezuela, playing both sides. They ought to be hanged for causing so much human suffering.

7302 2018-01-18 06:48:46 Yes, that is one thing all the recipes agree on, the oil/lard/dripping must be really hot, and all have oven about 200-220 deg C. Surprised you've never had a go at these!
7303 2018-01-18 06:48:13 PRO TIP: Do NOT transport a B&BW ginger and cardamon olive oil body scrub in your backpack. It will leak, and the consequences will be vast.

7393 2018-01-18 06:32:47 No it’s a lot more complicated than that, AUTHORITARIANISM KILLS. It kills any government no matter what approaches they try. & their economy is reliant on Oil alone. A non diverse economy is easy to fall into corrupt hands of authoritarianism.
7394 2018-01-18 06:32:43 You appear an oil patch type so you are likely very biased towards corpratist rhetoric and are likely to harbour ill intentions towards many types of indigenous. For someone with your background, where stealing native land means high profits, there is always a bias against rights

7400 2018-01-18 06:31:22 Bull. Vegans in America have normal BMI and are the only class of people in that situation. Eat a whole foods plant-based diet with no added oil and you could have a normal BMI within 6-18 months.
7401 2018-01-18 06:31:22 If the $ is spent on infrastructure, there will be a gain. Funny how the tax breaks for oil companies resulted in fewer jobs.

Great 
7419 2018-01-18 06:28:29 You should be ashamed of yourself. You're a mouthpiece to big oil, you do not represent the American public interest. You are trying to sell the idea that industry doesn't need regulation. That will bite you in the ass, and I hope it hurts.

7462 2018-01-18 06:21:15 Ohh, my bad. I misread "older painting" as "oil painting" and I was eager to lean why the kind of paint used on the original piece mattered. I love the idea of recycling old pieces and couldn't figure out why it was important for it to be oil. I guess that makes more sense lol.

7510 2018-01-18 06:10:17 Well, with oil the thinking is that controlled, and reduced production by the OPEC cartel has driven up the price a bit. Canadian export oil is still cheap, around $35/barrel.

7542 2018-01-18 06:04:43 George’s mum (who self describes as ‘relatively cosmic’) booked me in with her craniosacral osteopath. He cracked my neck and reckons I may be sleeping on a lay line. Thankfully there’s an essential oil for that.
7543 2018-01-18 06:04:30 it sounds odd but whenever my face gets really dry i put coconut oil on it and let it sit over night then rinse it off in the morning 

i also apply lotion literally like 3/4 times before doing my makeup !! i have super dry skin & this is pretty much the only thing that helps me

7552 2018-01-18 06:02:14 Do your homework. Oil wells would go in gulf and I grew up here on island in gulf. Sanibel. Trump would not be affected either way but all us that work for living would if there was another spill. Tourism is our income.

That’s water and oil,it just doesn’t mix!!

7581 2018-01-18 05:55:55 Instead of buying a beauty oil, use some olive oil to mix with the foundation. I don’t know if that would work, I’m really sceptical about it 
7582 2018-01-18 05:55:23 Allahumma afini fii badni,wa sam'i wa basri...
7583 2018-01-18 05:54:56 So lots of fruits, vegetables, and meats (1 ingredient each). Peanut butter with just peanuts and salt and maybe palm oil, (but never added sugar). Nuts and such for snacks. Few boxed goods. Few pre-packaged sauces, etc. More cooking from scratch.
7584 2018-01-18 05:54:37 Only use raw uncooked Olive Oil for salads etc to get benefits out of it ; DO NOT cook it, it becomes way more fattening than usual
7585 2018-01-18 05:54:33 Awwwnnnn feena
7586 2018-01-18 05:54:29 Desalination.

Where's the desal plants? No one should run out if water anywhere in this world,v especially a coastal town.

Yes, desal uses energy (including most fossil fuels at this point), but it solves water crisis.

There should be vast water piping networks more than oil.
7587 2018-01-18 05:54:27 Good to have Tillerson, he's one of the voices of reason in this administration. I thought he was going to be a lot worse being an oil executive, but he's been a force for good. :)
7588 2018-01-18 05:54:26 @McDonalds is it true your fries contain or are fried in beef oil?

7599 2018-01-18 05:52:15 What bothers me is None of this bothers Trump! Why would he think USA wouldn’t need working State Department? And Tillerson, former oil man, awarded medal by Putin, as Secy of State has always bugged me. It’s about oil, money, Russians & lifting sanctions to make $$ billions $$!
7600 2018-01-18 05:52:04 I forgot how amazing coconut oil feels and smells on my skin 
7601 2018-01-18 05:51:31 I applied myself to life the same way my aunt applies holy oil to sleeping people

7603 2018-01-18 05:51:15 Ooo i didnt even think of an oil pull
7604 2018-01-18 05:51:10 i love one heck of a blot from soap and glory! it’s supposed to control oil, and i do get oily in the center of my face, but i can’t say it does anything crazy (or at all). however, i use it even when i’m very very dry because it’s smoothing and leaves a nice soft finish
7605 2018-01-18 05:50:31 Really,really hard too. Dumping the olive oil on the floor,harassing the dog,ect..ugh.
7606 2018-01-18 05:50:20 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
7607 2018-01-18 05:50:08 Kansas tax policy had no effect on the collapse in the Ag commodity prices and the price of oil.
7608 2018-01-18 05:49:49 Take a spoon and pour what ever oil is cooking the bottom of the egg and pour on top of the egg until it's cooked
7609 2018-01-18 05:49:41 And clearly you have not done your research. Flaxseed oil contains not only omega-3 but also omega-6 and omega-9 of which current research indicates too much imbalance of  omega-6 vs omega-3 causes inflamation. It is recommended to take fish oil over flax oil due to more benefits
7610 2018-01-18 05:49:39 Oh Scotland remembers the Wood Group from the 2014 Indy referendum. Never off the box. The oil has evaporated.
7611 2018-01-18 05:49:34 Nah foo them Montgomery glands lol they hold the oil that keeps the nipple moisturized.

7619 2018-01-18 05:47:46 Thank you for being honest. Being a VERY pale person, it’s hard for me to find foundations that are oil free, and with a pink undertone. You’re amazing! Don’t ever change!!

7621 2018-01-18 05:47:43 We have given just too much importance to oil prices they form about 8-10 bn usd/mth. On a rising stock market and good eco indices just expat remittance is about the same amt notwithstanding huge inflows into stock market and capex.

7638 2018-01-18 05:44:23 Yes to buy a barrel of oil you have to convert your native money supply into the US dollar called reserve currency. The Yuan is China’s currency and they r now not converting the Yuan into US currency which is supposed to start tomorrow.

7642 2018-01-18 05:43:20 Verizon and Comcast spent $ on lobbying against Net Neutrality in order to spread the lies you swallowed.

Google did not.

Follow the money. Verizon and Comcast own monopolies/duopolies in much of their market share. Them selling you a free market solution is snake oil.

Both advocate a vegan diet but explain (backed up by medical evidence/research) why oil should not be in it.
7648 2018-01-18 05:43:01 Here's a good opportunity to stand up for ending palm oil plantations and other Indonesian and Malaysian rainforest exploitation. Orangutans will be gone within 100 years if we don't.
7649 2018-01-18 05:42:59 you what you guys... Chace Crawford should have been a bigger star. i mean like specifically in terms of like a tv actor. why did tv give up on him after blood and oil. he should have steady work on a long running upper mediocre series.
7650 2018-01-18 05:42:35 If you want a better Nigeria, tax collection from the informal sector has to improve. That plus paternity leave from Access Bank, @cenbank plans to promote Tomato/Cocoa/Palm oil production and more #BusinessExpress981 on @Smooth981FM with @MazinoAppeal
7651 2018-01-18 05:42:35 cleansing oil: works great to remove make up and impurities before using a foam cleanser. Non-irritating.

7661 2018-01-18 05:40:13 You have to understand, this was long before the time of enlightened skincare lol. Back then, you combatted oil w/ lots of exfoliating and oil absorbing stuff. 
7662 2018-01-18 05:40:13 Oil changes and air filters are very important parts of engine maintenance;  however, a thorough inspection of all engine, transmission, cooling,  brakes and suspension components should also be performed regularly.

7678 2018-01-18 05:37:52 I’m about to start using my coconut oil as a moisturizer cause this winter is vicious hunty
7679 2018-01-18 05:37:40 I hope I find some oil here soon.
7680 2018-01-18 05:37:15 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.47
7681 2018-01-18 05:37:03 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
7682 2018-01-18 05:36:49 That's why the world especially India is trying to meet its energy needs through non conventional ways to reduce their dependence on oil...if that happens then I believe it would make a big change in our foreign policy towards Arabs..
7683 2018-01-18 05:36:32 alternatives to pharmaceuticals would be alpha lipoic acid, benfotiamine (these two have some evidence in painful diabetic neuropathy), topical capsaicin, topical lidocaine, or acupuncture.   I have had one patient report benefits with topical CBD oil.
7684 2018-01-18 05:36:02 Having combination skin is waking up with an oil slick in the center of your face and the top of your cheeks are peeling cuz it's winter.
7685 2018-01-18 05:35:05 "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,..." ~Luke 10:34
7686 2018-01-18 05:35:02 Only a black person would go to a butchery and buy bones and only to complain that 'these bones got no meat'.
My brother you said you want bones,stop being emotional,you need deliverance and 32 bottles of anointing oil.
7687 2018-01-18 05:34:57 Well well well. This is indeed a very unfortunate time of this presidential term for oil prices to go up internationally. #TheDominoEffect
7688 2018-01-18 05:34:45 Sir oil , natural gases & coal will be no longer in future. However renewable sources of energy r not producing much energy. And it would stop most of manufacturing , & services sectors will comes to end .
7689 2018-01-18 05:34:44 Just put mad olive oil in my hair let's see how it works
7690 2018-01-18 05:34:41 You just spray your fries with cooking oil and then put garlic salt on top of them. Very simple but it makes a huge difference.
7691 2018-01-18 05:34:28 Love drenching my face in tea tree oil
7692 2018-01-18 05:34:26 A fellow farmer tried that route. Walked up to people holding "will work for food" signs. They said they were hungry not stupid There will always be a need for welfare because of disabled and elderly. Laziness isn't a good excuse.
7693 2018-01-18 05:34:24 Bullshit.  He just wants large print because he’s old and blinded by Russian oil money.
7694 2018-01-18 05:34:17 @ClintonFdn 1/2 Remember Mark Rich, he sold oil 2the Iranian regime while they were holding Americans hostage. He was facing 325 years in prison & $48M In back taxes. William “Cigar in Vagina” Clinton on his last day in office pardoned him. This was condemned by even Democrats.

7698 2018-01-18 05:33:42 Interesting - thanks for the info. Still gonna take my daily 2 tbsp of coconut oil. Seem to be in a nice groove with it. But I’m not aiming for strict keto right now, just low carb. You generally avoid coconut oil?
7699 2018-01-18 05:33:39 จริงค่าาาาา 
7700 2018-01-18 05:33:31 My wife uses coconut oil
7701 2018-01-18 05:33:03 بهدوء الصباح وروعتــه..
ربي لا تحرمنا من أمنية تُفـرح قلوبنــا،
ربي أشرق مع نور شمسك بشائرآ من الفرح تسعدني وتسعدهم♡

 صباح الخير ...
7702 2018-01-18 05:32:51 I got my wife a diffuser for Christmas and I will say that EVOO works much better than the standard vegetable oil.

7704 2018-01-18 05:32:30 A small teaspoon of coconut oil rubbed on it clears it up
7705 2018-01-18 05:32:25 coconut oil.
7706 2018-01-18 05:31:59 ha ha, never liked them... or midnight oil for that matter.
7707 2018-01-18 05:31:57 I want my next purchases to be a salt lamp & oil diffuser. On my fake hotep wave
7708 2018-01-18 05:31:19 Yeah, I live on the Gulf Coast of Florida & suffered the BP oil spill.
No thanks.
Get off my feed
And oh yeah, f you...
Clean, sustainable energy is what we need. Why do you think Florida is called the “sunshine state”?

7709 2018-01-18 05:31:15 Tomorrow I'm doing a face mask. Begone, oil.
7710 2018-01-18 05:31:15 I too am of the “I used to sit in my mom’s station wagon while they propped it up 6 feet for an oil change” generation
7711 2018-01-18 05:31:07 out here tryna get a Nintendo switch when I def need an oil change
7712 2018-01-18 05:31:07 $RBR is a labor hire company & is only 1 of 3 accredited providers of labor hire (with a labor broking license) in Mozambique. IMO this company is on the cusp of a major re-rate because of the Oil & Gas opportunities which have opened up in Mozambique. Looks ready to run.
7713 2018-01-18 05:31:05 I have it and I just did bloodwork and my TSH was at a 10  I've slept 10+ hours a day for months now. I think drinking a ton of water and taking plenty of vitamins/fish oil helps...but then again, everything is hard when you feel so blah!

7715 2018-01-18 05:30:38 “You boys all clean up so nicely,” Isabelle smiled at him and he grinned sheepishly under the compliment. “Such a shame you’re all gearblocked scoundrels,” she sighed, her eyes drifting to an old oil paint portrait of her own scoundrel.

7716 2018-01-18 05:30:30 This tweet proves that mottaramblue is:
1- Thick as 500k planks for believing tabloid garbage
2- Sad, bitter and confused about how a world class player could reject an oil man’s toy club in favour of the biggest club in the world 
7717 2018-01-18 05:30:19 Dear Shell,

You have a wonderful opportunity here to save huge money by firing the marketing fools and agency responsible for this silliness. You don’t need to be ashamed for being a good oil company anymore.

Sincerely,
#TrumpTrain
7718 2018-01-18 05:29:49 Oil it
7719 2018-01-18 05:29:23 It’s a method of controlling oil! Wayne Goss did a video on it, it works :)
7720 2018-01-18 05:29:14 I pine for the good ol' days when we were dropping 84 bombs a day in the middle east. I pine for the days when we were throwing whistle blowers in prison, and the days where we could ignore poisoned water in Flint, or oil spills from Keystone pipelines. The good ol' days.....
7721 2018-01-18 05:29:11 $oil head n shoulders on the 15 min? lets see if we get to $63.50 by morning.
7722 2018-01-18 05:28:35 Oil from sunken Iranian tanker spreads over 100 sq km of East China Sea
7723 2018-01-18 05:28:35 Oh please! How thick are you? Scotland, our Nation have always been and always will be pro European! Speak for yor own country, NOT ours who voted 62% Remain! Scots will chose to leave UK to be in single market, after all we have many resources like our massive oil & gas industry
7724 2018-01-18 05:28:29 aku malah pakai cushionnya face shop habis pakai moisturizer,pengen beli rose hip oil juga cuma belum nemu yg pas

7725 2018-01-18 05:28:27 Could someone tell NY STATE that! I wish POTUS would pass laws that would stop certain states from being obstructionist to the Natural gas & oil industry! NY has costed our entire country by holding up the very natural gas they use for their heat ,cooling & their economic cars!
7726 2018-01-18 05:27:14 Orange County ain't got a lot going for it tbh. Went to Huntington Beach for the first time. They have oil rigs on the coast. Can't even keep their most attractive asset attractive.
7727 2018-01-18 05:26:38 Just as the EU mission report asserts,Kenyans are ready and prepared for that crucial civil war if that is the language that kikuyus and Americans love.We know that uhuruto have struck oil deals with Americans to support their illegitimacy for turkana oil
7728 2018-01-18 05:26:17 Their people have gold and oil. There is no reason fot them to be living in squalor. On top of all that, there were the earthquake donations. They should be living quite well.
7729 2018-01-18 05:26:16 You have to drizzle some olive oil and salt on it and roast it in the oven... delicious, I promise!

7731 2018-01-18 05:25:33 Have you tried anything natural like coconut or grapeseed oil?
7732 2018-01-18 05:25:29 Not really--the only reason the NEP went away was a change in oil prices and a change in Ottawa. History shows Lougheed had little to do with it.
7733 2018-01-18 05:25:04 tea tree oil is one of the nastiest smells ever
7734 2018-01-18 05:24:58 Hunger is a great motivator to work. Pretty cold outside now. Welfare ppl would scoop and slop.hogs for meal and hot cot if it didn't exist?

7736 2018-01-18 05:24:44 John D Rockefeller almost lost everything when he waited too long to switch his petroleum product output from lamp oil to gasoline - and used too much debt to do it.  

You'd think people would learn...only the banks, etc. profit by YOUR debt.
7737 2018-01-18 05:24:42 Shoutout to that lady on here who put me on that almond oil and jojoba oil...God bless
7738 2018-01-18 05:24:38 Try some Tea Tree Oil! After that take Castor oil like everyday. A tablespoon a day. I took it when I was a little girl. I rarely get sick now
7739 2018-01-18 05:24:05 Well I have nipple rings so I clean them every night, vitamin E oil with my bath and body works lotion.. smelling good and soft asssfff they look n feel amazing

7743 2018-01-18 05:23:21 Remind them that there is no meaningful poverty alleviation efforts without addressing agriculture and its challenges. We kindly ask them to support our initiative to produce edible oil by increasing production and productivity of our palm trees in Kigoma.
7744 2018-01-18 05:22:51 Mending pake oil cleanser dari pada pake mama lemon...

7760 2018-01-18 05:19:47 How about stop relying on oil and gas for revenue and tap into the cannabis trade going from NM to CO. I probably spent ovr $1500 last yr myself on wknds in CO!

7766 2018-01-18 05:18:49 Heat is too high. When your oil burns like that, you need to turn that burner down. Trust me I’m culinary student

7822 2018-01-18 05:10:52 There won’t be any surprises. Natty should underperform oil weighted peers this year. Scheduled TCPL outages this summer won’t anything.

7832 2018-01-18 05:09:54 @Essar_Oil @Essar Pls. Share customer service email id for raising a complaint against your petrol outlet in Bengaluru, Karnataka
7833 2018-01-18 05:09:31 Being charitable, maybe he means get off margarine, canola oil etc. If he means get off butter, olive oil etc, then it's a plot to knock off the Pres.

Or they R hiding their secret relationships w our enemies. Who knew that Obama's sanctions were going 2 STOP Sec. of State Tillerson's big oil deal w Russia? No wonder Trump tried 2 get sanctions removed?

7853 2018-01-18 05:05:56 The oil regulations removal is stupid because of the need to support renewable resources. Despite the idiot Trump not understanding Climate Change or how important it is not to hurt the support of at least every minority in the world with racist comments, it's happening.

My grandma has migraines, so I mix her 4 drops of peppermint, 4 drops of lavender, and the rest of the little bottle with coconut oil (you can do any oil).Then, whenever she has a headache, she uses a cotton swab to rub the mix on her temples and under her nose.
7868 2018-01-18 05:02:40 JĀSÖN Vitamin E oil has solved my winter face problems. Plus it smells like marzipan. Highly recommend.

Man those kernels sound PISSED when they're popped.

With butter, it sounds like Al Jarreau scatting - "Pop. Pop pop-poppity."

With olive oil it sounds like a drive-by.

7924 2018-01-18 04:54:23 OPEC & Russia output cuts, coupled with robust global demand, tighten the market, crude prices have soared to a 3yr high near $70/barrel. That’s prompted warnings -- from Iran’s oil minister to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- of a fresh surge in U.S. production

7965 2018-01-18 04:48:52 How petty and ridiculous is this? One of the fake stories was about feeding fish? Anyway, it’s all just a sad ploy to get people to check out his accomplishments. Truly some used car/snake oil salesmen sales techniques. “Hey, fake news awards! Now check all the stuff I did!”

7969 2018-01-18 04:48:18 Plastic contains oil, lots of energy stored, maybe the problem will solve itself when fossil fuel runs out (or as price goes up). Just need to find a clever way to burn it on large scale without emitting dioxins, the rest is easy, steam turbines just like nuclear power.

7977 2018-01-18 04:46:15 I heard that cooking with olive oil is a no-no now.  It scorches at low heat and releases carcinogens!
7978 2018-01-18 04:45:59 What always helped me was putting tea tree oil on it in the morning and then at night crush pure aspirin and mix it with saline solution and put the paste on their. That’s what my piercer always says and it’s worked every time
7979 2018-01-18 04:45:57 Surprised Mile High is that low, and Lucas Oil that high. As far as loudest venues, my ears were ringing for nearly two days after attending a basketball game at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, AR.

7982 2018-01-18 04:45:40 I didn't factor in a change of balance when removing a time series from a 342 bottle incubation with crude oil. The bottle holder on the shaker table got dislodged and I walked in to sediments and oil everywhere ... lost 270 bottles o_o #scienceoopsies
7983 2018-01-18 04:45:40 We use coconut oil for everything. It started wit bulletproof coffee to carrier oils now its everywhere.
7984 2018-01-18 04:45:40 On Pinterest there is a home remedy that I have personally tried and it works I’ve been doing it for almost 6 months now and I have seen dramatic changes in growth and health.                           You will need 2 Eggs

7987 2018-01-18 04:45:16 Always remember Trump was a card carrying WWA wanna be. Bannon would never risk losing faith w/the alt right. There silence is deafing. I have a feeling Bannon N Trump R playing games. Steve, Jared, Trump, money. Paul, Flynn, politics N contacts. Russian Oil, Nuke reactor. $$$$$$
7988 2018-01-18 04:45:00 Giving Trump credit for the market is like giving Obama credit for the biggliest boom in oil and gas in history during his term. Where else you going to put your money? Negative interest bonds, a savings account with .25 interest?

7995 2018-01-18 04:43:42 Who remembers when every girl wanted that scrunched hair wet look??? Or was that just the hood girls???? Because I remember my sister using gel, mousse, hair spray to get the scrunch look then using a dab of vegetable (yes, vegetable) oil to make it look wet 
7996 2018-01-18 04:43:34 That’s what people said in early-mid 2008 when oil was $140 ish.

7998 2018-01-18 04:42:59 reasonable for Norway given price of oil and its oil policy (tho i would argue that policy is overly conservative)

Sweden's fiscal policy by contrast is obviously too tight.    Indirectly contributing to Sweden's housing boom (b/c CB offsets tight fiscal with low rates)
7999 2018-01-18 04:42:55 also oil companies are using seismic surveying tests to look for oil sources underneath the earth’s surface. Underwater seismic surveying is detrimental to marine life, indigenous lands/waters and entire ecosystems !!!

8001 2018-01-18 04:42:46 You can "oven fry" chicken with a lot less oil. This recipe was from when the Colonel 1st opened his gas station. Today they use a "wet" coating & pressure cookers. I guarantee that this version tastes like crap & in the video, that flame under the oil was WAY too high!

8083 2018-01-18 04:31:51 For one, a decrease in supply will result in an increase in prices; that's basic economics. And secondly, when OPEC runs out of oil the rest of the world will be left to their own devices. A renewable energy source should be invested in now so it's not a problem later.

8087 2018-01-18 04:31:34 For example with oil. The economists would say things like "Higher demand  has caused the price to rise over the last year" which is such BS because oil would move by huge margins out of all proportion to the change in demand. So what's the explanation? Speculation?

Jesse- “is that what you use for lube?”
8103 2018-01-18 04:30:04 the struggle for clear skin is drinking 3 gallons of water, moisturizing everyday, and using all the tea tree oil in the world  just to wake up with a huge pimple 
8104 2018-01-18 04:29:52 I appreciate you.  I use tea tree oil, black soap, and witch hazel but my skin been trippen lately I think I gotta drink more water 
8105 2018-01-18 04:29:47 you would think this gets more priority considering the palm oil industry accounts for 5% of gdp and jobs in the workforce
8106 2018-01-18 04:29:36 Good late night to all, are you sick of this damn cold weather. I know I am, please ask the sun to turn up it’s heater. My poor car got the sniffles, gave it some cough oil!!
8107 2018-01-18 04:29:19 muesli is unbaked and shouldn't have the added sweeteners and oil that granola has from being baked...but in America that's theoretical.
8108 2018-01-18 04:29:19 do not worry long term on the Naira as its way is only up, the price of oil will be supportive and the enormous economic potential of Nigeria will do the rest.

8112 2018-01-18 04:28:50 Everybody can see what the fuck he’s doing, right? Everyone can see that he’s destroying green energy entirely and doesn’t give two craps about the environment and just wants to enrich his oil and coal owning buddies, right?
8113 2018-01-18 04:28:49 I like to pick the minds of the elites. I got the olive oil down just got to get some avocado

8116 2018-01-18 04:28:31 Coconut oil has zero carbs - is there some sort of hormonal response to MCTs that prohibits optimal keto benefits?
8117 2018-01-18 04:28:11 It’s time to see if DoTerra Oregano oil will help prevent the flu. One drop in hot water with honey and lemon. 3x daily. #flu #fluseason
8118 2018-01-18 04:28:09 Sometimes tea tree oil can be drying so use a good mosturizer or dilute it

8126 2018-01-18 04:27:21 I put on some baby oil man it brought back memories 
8127 2018-01-18 04:27:20 I slap extra virgin coconut oil on my ass n tiddies before bed so I can be soft in the future
8128 2018-01-18 04:27:01 I need serious oil Reece

8130 2018-01-18 04:26:10 Perfect thing to listen to while burning the late night oil in the darkened office.
The staircases reminded me a ton of House of Leaves.
8131 2018-01-18 04:25:54 そのうち夢特性として本来の特性を盛ったウルトラビーストが出るのかなぁ
8132 2018-01-18 04:25:50 All this time I was under the impression that sea buckthorn was some dr.oz manufactured snake oil. Guess we learn something new everyday
8133 2018-01-18 04:25:48 Saudi oil runs out in 2050. Trying to Offload 5% in a $1 Trillion IPO.
Adapt or Die....well mayby fade away.
8134 2018-01-18 04:25:47 Just found out that if you push up on your nose a certain way oil comes out
8135 2018-01-18 04:25:29 Did you use butter or oil?
8136 2018-01-18 04:25:20 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
8137 2018-01-18 04:25:18 Can hardly wait when this nightmare is happening off the Monterey Coast because screw the marine preserve, I need mah Ford Man Truck to go 2 miles an hour while stuck on the 405 north. Then some pile of human waste from big oil will say "we're sorry, but we're not."
8138 2018-01-18 04:25:12 You gonna do a podcast about that show with the space taxi that cost all the oil on earth?
8139 2018-01-18 04:25:07 Knowledgeable Theologians?

All knowledgeable Bullshitters aka knowledgeable snake oil pushers.
8140 2018-01-18 04:25:00 I was just looking to dm you  i couldn't find your name for nothing & I just ordered some glycolic acid toner, it should be here this week ima get some tea tree oil to try to
8141 2018-01-18 04:24:45 OILの字見て思い出したんだけどOTLっていつ頃流行ってたんだっけね
8142 2018-01-18 04:24:42 High quality olive oil & fish are also great ways to get healthy fats in your diet! You don’t have to have avocados 
8143 2018-01-18 04:24:39 その原理で行くとビーストブーストの特性を会得するのは主人公じゃないか？
8144 2018-01-18 04:24:26 Not sure how the BP oil spill relates to climate change and the president, but you certainly chalk up one negative point for being a typical politician
8145 2018-01-18 04:24:21 @POTUS 
Thank you for the leadership we have been waiting for! And thanks for my job. Oil & gas industry is booming. Many black & Latino O & G workers in Texas didn't know they were republicans till you came and people like me explained that working was better than welfare. Pride
8146 2018-01-18 04:24:07 ふと思ったけどビーストブーストって元々はUBの特性じゃなくてウルトラホール通った影響で会得した特性らしいけど主人公がワープライドして元の世界からゲットしたUBの特性もビーストブーストなのはなんでなんだ？
8147 2018-01-18 04:23:38 this approaching palm oil cold war is getting so little attention bcos you know, complacency. there will be political and economic ramifications beyond the obvious
8148 2018-01-18 04:22:41 On the other hand, if any USA Administration person had a corrupt (FCPA) connection with Rosatom (the TLI scandal was between TLI and rosatom) it was the Trump Group, possibly Michael Flynn who was trying to make a deal with the Gulf Oil States to sell them Nuclear power plants!
8149 2018-01-18 04:22:24 olive oil cake actually! super goodddd.
8150 2018-01-18 04:22:23 why is it that whenever I use oil on my roots, all the oil will migrate upwards instead of downwards?
8151 2018-01-18 04:21:58 I'll abstain then.  Oil Citiers been pissing me off calling one of my top 5 favorite heroes "selfish" when their Queen and their neutered King are the gold medalists for selfish.
8152 2018-01-18 04:21:51 long $yen from 145 1lot- thinking euro may come off some more b4 getting back in.
aussie looking better with oil supporting
8153 2018-01-18 04:21:44 U know how much I enjoy flirting with Big Oil, right wing partisan hacks who r intent on bringing the politics of resentment to Oregon...fueled by Koch Bros-styled opaque “non profits” and a willingness to race bait. And without 1 ounce of interests in real problem solving.
8154 2018-01-18 04:21:29 Can imagine. Syria isn’t going to solve easy - esp with predicted up spike in climate disruption (and trump & oil plans)..... very sad for the people too to lose their natural heritage. Crazy times.
8155 2018-01-18 04:21:23 Grab a spoon olive oil, vaseline or coconut oil girl ! Works just as well~
8156 2018-01-18 04:21:20 For Christmas, I was gifted an essential oil diffuser and a Google home mini. These items are the same size and same shape. Over/under how many days until I pour lavender oil on the wrong device?
8157 2018-01-18 04:21:19 I am convinced that I need to keep togarashi, chilli oil and hot sauce with me  everywhereeeee I gooo. Why does everything taste so bland??? 
8158 2018-01-18 04:21:14 The oil guy is supposed to come tomorrow, yeah. But we haven't spoken to the landlord yet (or about all the other bills because they just came), so I dunno if that'll be an issue. Blergh.
8159 2018-01-18 04:21:06 Oil up on threats of rebel attacks in Kenedy, falling US crude stocks
8160 2018-01-18 04:20:53 and that turn down is what were looking for when oil is turning back up?
8161 2018-01-18 04:20:51 Trump stands up to him? How? Countries are still providing to NK because they see trump as a laughing stock. Oil is being offloaded by China & Japan. SK is honoring NK @olympics against his wishes. His bullying doesn’t work.
8162 2018-01-18 04:20:41 Same! Across Chicago some snake oil salesman keeps posting large stickers claiming to cure 100% of cancers with new miracle cure. I have ripped down every single one I have seen!
8163 2018-01-18 04:20:30 tea tree oil is really my best friend.
8164 2018-01-18 04:20:29 Renewable sources of energy should be funded at a much larger scale than they are now! Big oil will only last so long and it's limited supply is the reason gas prices get higher year by year.
8165 2018-01-18 04:20:02 I’m gonna put coconut oil in my hair, take a bath and pass the fuck out
8166 2018-01-18 04:19:46 Tap into that shit that makes you feel good 
with no downsides. Strike oil out that bitch.
8167 2018-01-18 04:19:39 Shacha: dried brillfish and shrimp, shallots, chiles, garlic and soybean oil.
8168 2018-01-18 04:19:33 Oil from sunken Iranian tanker diffusing in Ronaldinho Sea
8169 2018-01-18 04:19:29 Keep temps the same all the time. My house can’t keep up when it’s sub zero anyway. At 500 a month for oil for heat and hot water, everyone can wear some layers.

8211 2018-01-18 04:12:07 Problem with banks is if one company/industry recovers , some other industry/company will see a slowdown.

8238 2018-01-18 04:06:44 Hope it works
Some connections of mine - in countries (such as Canada) where it is legal - say that cannabis oil works better than any of the patent sleeping tablet medications - so maybe we should hope that cannabis oil becomes fully legalised here soon?
8239 2018-01-18 04:06:42 Omg I made low carb chips by just putting avocado oil salt and garlic powder on low carb tortillas and baking them and they’re some of the best chips I’ve ever had that’s dangerous
8240 2018-01-18 04:06:31 This essential oil defuser thing is actually pretty dope 
8241 2018-01-18 04:06:02 U.S forces are (occupying) the oil rich provinces of Syria anybody that thinks they are going anytime soon better think again.
8242 2018-01-18 04:06:02 Just imagine if the world recognized the legitimacy of ISIS tyranny and bought their oil, sold weapons, by now they were Building sex slave markets in Europe. North Korea isn't much better, it's practically a Communist theocracy treating Kims as eternal gods, others slaves
8243 2018-01-18 04:05:53 Diffusing = spreading out and polluting vast expanses of the East China Sea. Just like the oil from the rig explosion "diffused" along our coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
8244 2018-01-18 04:05:50 I like to use extra coconut oil when I cook spinach because it makes it easier to scrape into the trash.
8245 2018-01-18 04:05:49 Just let China look for oil,  endangered species & destroy the marine habitat in the process. Then create a new 12 dash line
8246 2018-01-18 04:05:49 That’s what the Swiss report says, which you didn’t read. Fortune telling has been around for a long time, so does that mean it’s true? No it doesn’t. Skeptics don’t sell snake oil preying on the vulnerable, you do, and you’re a horrible human being.
8247 2018-01-18 04:05:48 lol!!!! (I knew that you would respond!) Maybe that's the problem! THey see you as one of those persons "still using oil heat" and are using thuggish behavior to have you convert to propane!!!
8248 2018-01-18 04:05:25 last year my eyebrows were unwreckable but now i have to massage olive oil on them every night to grow them back. life comes at u fast b safe
8249 2018-01-18 04:05:20 He usually waits til January to change the oil
8250 2018-01-18 04:05:17 Pretty sure I just got peppermint oil in my eye. Rip to my vision 
8251 2018-01-18 04:05:15 But tbh Vitamin E oil & a wash cloth has worked the best for me. It's vegan if you get the liquid bottle instead of the gel caps.
8252 2018-01-18 04:05:14 lead us to salvation. pour that oil please.
8253 2018-01-18 04:05:06 ++

8256 2018-01-18 04:04:43 Soooo... you finally caught up!  My initial response made reference to the incidents involving Chinese and Russian tankers attempting to offload oil onto North Korean tankers.  Both were caught in the act.  Thus, my use of the term "attempted."

8260 2018-01-18 04:04:26 I've been using and recommending oregano oil for years!!! I swear by it and always keep some in the fridge.
8261 2018-01-18 04:04:22 Yeah those jackasses take money from the big drug oil & insurance companies while receiving a paycheck from the American Taxpayers now why should this shit be allowed to continue the problem is we are all a bunch of pansies we don’t force the issue that’s why
8262 2018-01-18 04:04:21 Is the scene going to be for the Oil Overload series ?
8263 2018-01-18 04:04:11 Is there anything you can do to rescue Venezuela from the narco marxists that kidnapped it? Pls consider that it has the largest oil reserves and it also hosts the most powerful drug cartel, hezbollah, they trade with weapons and passports which are sold to terrorists. SOS
8264 2018-01-18 04:04:08 Crock pot & mrs dash salt free taco seasoning. Bake it in the oven w/ fat free Italian. Grill in a skillet w/ a little olive oil
8265 2018-01-18 04:04:00 does anyone know if a eucalyptus oil diluted in a humidifier is dangerous for dogs??
8266 2018-01-18 04:03:29 How's this tweet working out for ya? Looks like the public hates offshore drilling and knows just how irresponsible the oil industry is.
8267 2018-01-18 04:03:24 I use natural shampoo and conditioners from marshalls or ogx. Or try putting coco oil and sleeping with it overnight then washing it out
8268 2018-01-18 04:03:23 Nope, we just need lots of oil to make us smart 
8269 2018-01-18 04:03:17 it was really simple! I got the organic cauliflower rice bag frm costco for $5.99 bc I dont have a processor to ground it that finely myself. I used a lil bit of oil, finely chopped garlic, salt and pepper, even a lil garlic powder and cooked it on a pan. topped it off w/cilantro
8270 2018-01-18 04:02:56 I like the way they sound surprised when you live near oil refineries then wonder why more industrial complexes are built
8271 2018-01-18 04:02:38 You realize that oil spill saved Florida’s economy right?
8272 2018-01-18 04:02:37 This is new for me. It says to build up the muscle in your front thighs to relieve pressure. Can't I just oil them like the tin man?

8275 2018-01-18 04:01:42 You can even add tomatoes, lemon juice, peppers, tahini, etc. in it. You can even use black beans in place of garbanzo. I like making my own, because you can control the amount of olive oil in it. Less calories = more to eat

8277 2018-01-18 04:01:31 Knowing how shit the USA`s luck is it he was probably serious. First the Civil war, a multiple personality disorder, Vietnam was a extreme aggression disorder, The funding of Mujha Hadeen in the 80's was a hallucination, gulf wars and Iraq was the greed for oil. Trump was aids
8278 2018-01-18 04:01:30 my mom got emo bc nobody massages her hair with oil and then she pouted and I died

8289 2018-01-18 03:59:36 My first car had a brake problem once. I pulled up to a friends house and he ran outside to find the screaming child he thought he heard. I had no idea. But I could tell by the shift in my engine when I needed my oil changed. Yay for HoH and deaf super powers and great jokes.
8290 2018-01-18 03:59:35 Since America has lost a lot of economic turf since last 40 years, the best America can do is to create a coalition of FTA's converging NAFTA, India, Japan, Australia, Russia, which can then form a bulwark against Islamo fascism, and its global blackmail using OIL as the backbone

8292 2018-01-18 03:59:12 It was now that Camilla brought her soft hands down and began to gently rub the woman’s back spreading the oil along it. Quite skilled with her hands, she gave the Hoshidan a nice massage.

8295 2018-01-18 03:58:46 She chews the bacon, appreciating that it was at least crispy, before swallowing. She can feel the oil entering her body. She shivers.

"With good reason. Chicken is so much better for the body. Lean, white meat."

She pauses, looking at her turnover.

8302 2018-01-18 03:57:21 I'm sure it's helping him, just in general :D it's a great way to live, but also a better approach for PD. Found that supplementing with MCT or coconut oil worthwhile, too. Worth trying if you haven't already & seeing if he thinks it makes a diff.

8308 2018-01-18 03:56:23 Essential oils can help take the edge off. Peppermint oil specifically. Have you tried that?

8314 2018-01-18 03:55:02 so i got this “relaxation” essential oil to go in my diffuser and i’ve had what would normally be a stressful night but i’ve been so calm and i really believe the essential oils work. goodnight
8315 2018-01-18 03:54:56 You would have agriculture and some oil around Kern county. No major population centers. You would definitely need more federal funds than you would be sending out.
8316 2018-01-18 03:54:40 about to rinse this coconut oil out of my hair and slick It down until tomorrow.
8317 2018-01-18 03:54:17 We are preparing to send DACA kids to other countries, we gave the richest Americans a tax break, made private jets tax deductible, have most of Puerto Rico without power or running water, gave tens of thousands of wilderness acres to oil companies. How great is that?
8318 2018-01-18 03:54:11 I have combination skin and I cleanse 2-3 times a day depending on level of oil. I also use toner and moisturizer, all from The Face Shop (the ones especially for acne). Sheet masks also help when I'm nearing the end of a break out period. Korean skincare works well for me.
8319 2018-01-18 03:54:11 Is that what @CandiceMalcolm or Pam Gellar told you about the #Shariah. Yeah, that's what I thought.
8320 2018-01-18 03:54:07 natural resources - usually oil and gas - from the earth.

8324 2018-01-18 03:53:42 Am I the only one who doesn’t give a fuck about wax n concentrates ? I’d rather smoke a fat ass blunt then take a hit off a oil pen....  
8325 2018-01-18 03:53:40 Him: What are u mixed with?

Me: Coconut oil, the shits, divine feminine energy, poetry, Hennessey & my ancestors
8326 2018-01-18 03:53:35 coconut oil is max clout
8327 2018-01-18 03:53:08 this coconut oil should be well relaxed throughout my hair & scalp.
8328 2018-01-18 03:52:52 Really? Because Trump is destroying national parks so people can drill for oil, is talking about opening up all US waters to drilling, and the GOP has voted against the environment over 500 times from 2010 to 2014.
8329 2018-01-18 03:52:32 Also, a topical cannabis oil works very well. You don't get high from this type of application and it helps with the pain quite well.

8353 2018-01-18 03:48:17 @Bob_Stauffer if you were running the Oil, would you entertain a blockbuster like  Drai/Klef/Benning + the 1st for Karlsson/Hoffman/Pageau + pick(maybe)? OTT keeps payroll down. EDM get McD lineman, a 3rd line C and Jesus on D.

8358 2018-01-18 03:47:47 Choice of plenty .. what will you buy. Infra, banks or oil related stocks? What about HUL & L&T? Too many choices! This is what happens when the markets fire on all four cylinders. Do not forget valuations please and buying only for long term. Got me steve?
8359 2018-01-18 03:47:11 Maybe it’s the same one. Do you use woodlock oil? Haha it works on everything!

Or the 1000s of crores by low oil prices coupled with high fuel prices

8377 2018-01-18 03:44:26 I highly suggest you not burp up fish oil supplements. Life is not okay right now. I’m not saying I did it on purpose. But it happened. And I hate it. 
8378 2018-01-18 03:44:25 i havent used loose powder in a while but skinfood peach multifinish powder is quite nice? the oil control is really good (and it smells amazing) :0
8379 2018-01-18 03:44:21 Here is the problem with the theory: There are many powerful countries in the world that don't have oil and spend massive amounts of money importing it, Expl: Germany, Japan, China.

8381 2018-01-18 03:44:03 My country is an empire built in a resource we don’t control in our borders. We have the MI complex..... I can digress forever about the US.... anyway! Oil fiat, trade only in that, blah blah blah. 

Why is it news we wanted over there to fuck shit up? It feeds our ruling class.
8382 2018-01-18 03:44:00 The coil prolly popped, you gotta scoop out the remaining oil and put it in a working one , youre welcome
8383 2018-01-18 03:43:37 And America invades Countries and commit genocide whenever possible when one doesnt look "white" under the guise of spreading freedom or getting its lands resources. Just like that farce of a War over oil.
8384 2018-01-18 03:43:35 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.

8386 2018-01-18 03:43:20 So I'm not to up to date on CBD oil, but it sounds to me like it can be used to treat the same things you would use cannabis for except it doesn't get you high.. so all I'm saying is the government better not make it a thing that that's what we're gonna use so we can't get high..
8387 2018-01-18 03:43:15 Aku pernah kayak gitu trus sebelum tidur aku pakein tea tree oil trus paginya langsung ga jadi numbuh jerawat.

8397 2018-01-18 03:42:17 Pro tip: NO FOIL! Toss yer bakers in oil, throw a good dash or two of kosher salt on 'em, bake on rack at 450 for an hour so the restulting crusty skin pops when you cut into it. Just sayin'.
8398 2018-01-18 03:41:58 うへー。今日間に合うんか俺
8399 2018-01-18 03:41:40 Making something you're meant to handle out of cardboard is a bad idea, for more reasons than I can count.  The material was flat out designed to absorb moisture. Your hands have oil on them. They will rapidly turn into a gross greasefest with creases in it.
Maybe seal it after?

8405 2018-01-18 03:41:06 Not affordable! Oil changes ever 3-6 months, $60 tops. Electric car problems, all computers, battery alone is $1000 for a used 1 just in a Prius, couldn’t imagine normal maintenance on those.
8406 2018-01-18 03:41:04 I love olive oil and garlic on bread.

8412 2018-01-18 03:40:13 My vape pipe just spontaneously combusted. I think it was excess oil between tank and battery. Quite a shock at first.

8420 2018-01-18 03:39:44 How do you get that I belittle oil spills, etc.? RE has just as big of evils just different ones. I have pointed them out to you but YOU belittle them to justify them in relation the evils of FF. Not once have I denied the evils of FF yet you reject/dismiss/justify evils of RE.
8421 2018-01-18 03:39:40 I bet I wouldn’t take Chitoka a frying pan, oil, chicken, flour, etc....

8423 2018-01-18 03:39:27 It’s so true. My hubby has been on a raise freeze since oil cashed. How much has everything gone up in the past 4 years. I have a full time job as well and it doesn’t seem like we are getting ahead.
8424 2018-01-18 03:38:51 Ifeanyi Uba (Capital oil) must return d phones he forcefully collected from #Biafran women in #Enugwu. Otherwise, #IPOB will tear him.

8427 2018-01-18 03:38:21 Is this a hypothetical situation or actual reporting, Matt? Haha. I remember Stauffer saying that there are cameras who follow around the team since Katz bought that movie production company. I wonder if we see another Oil change with Chia trading Hall?

8443 2018-01-18 03:36:11 hey, car people who know their stuff;

I'm doing a shifter rebuild for my NA Miata and was wondering if I could use Mobil 1 Synthetic 75W-90 LS gear oil. I've looked at several sources and saw that it was alright to use for my manual transmission, but I just want to be 100% sure.
8444 2018-01-18 03:35:54 Woodlock Oil cures everything. Just makes your eyes burn 
8445 2018-01-18 03:35:47 Vitamin E oil! I put it on at night and my skin has balance out :)
8446 2018-01-18 03:35:43 I'd need to know more, but my initial reaction to that is yuck because of 2009 ecigs and cartridges. That makes me think my thoughts on vaping oil is right and it wouldn't work because it would destroy coils too fast.
8447 2018-01-18 03:35:23 That oil spill happened under your precious leader Obama dipsh*t!!  Be careful forcing us tp believe global warming.  We might force you to believe in our God.  You stay over there and do your thing while we chose to use our heads!

8454 2018-01-18 03:34:14 Right? Back in the day when a snake oil salesman got you, at least you had a bottle of olive oil to dip your bread in or veggie oil to cook your dinner in.

8456 2018-01-18 03:33:57 This is the part Liberals don't get. They'd rather be beholden to Middle East oil, a subject they vilify on its own, than to have the U.S. be energy independent While we work toward entirely clean energy.

8490 2018-01-18 03:30:07 Yes! It Lil just depends on how you use it. For example, you can use the oil for a hot out treatment and use the spray normally.
8491 2018-01-18 03:30:06 Need to do a deep condition and hot oil treatment for my hair. This dry weather ain’t no joke on my curls!! Gotta keep them hydrated.

8693 2018-01-18 03:03:23 Imagine if those who made hemp & cannabis illegal due to fears of losing money they invested in oil, cotton & forest industry had invested in hemp instead.  What a world we would live in.

8696 2018-01-18 03:03:02 Palmitate is the main Sat fat produced by DNL, so add palm oil to sugar (normal rodent HFD) and Bob's your uncle.
Odd that experts think that palm oil/carb combos are okay because palmitate has little effect on LDL.
Or should I say, bloody typical.

8700 2018-01-18 03:02:18 They get paid family leave, are environmentally friendly, and are ranked beat for business...

But yeah America is fucking great. It has a water crisis several years old, displaces native peoples to build an oil pipeline thru their land, and exploits nature for profit.

8705 2018-01-18 03:01:29 it partially depends on the fibers of the brush, to clean them try 1 part olive oil and 1 part dish soap (works 1000x better than most brush cleaners i’ve used).

8756 2018-01-18 02:54:52 It's like if u say, "I decided not to go to Texas because my dad used to own an oil well there and he sold it too cheap." I can't tell why would that make you avoid Texas. Is it just too painful of a memory? Is that why Trump isn't going to London? He can't bear it?

8759 2018-01-18 02:54:38 florida doesn't really have seasons beyond "somewhat less humid and hot" so the most i do is drop/add moisturizing steps as needed. usually in the winter i just add jojoba oil to my night cream and mask a little more for moisture

8765 2018-01-18 02:53:07 I'd goes so far as to hazard a guess that actually making solar panels is less damaging to one's health than working in a coal mine or on an oil derrick. I'm wrong a lot.

8778 2018-01-18 02:51:15 This seems like a complete contradiction. If the US had learnt from mistakes made in Iraq, wouldn't the correct course of action be to respect Syria's sovereignty & not occupy them, even if only the oil producing regions?

8820 2018-01-18 02:44:47 If the price goes up, it stands to reason that visitors/revenue goes down. Does this give Trump leverage to open sites up to mining and oil?
8821 2018-01-18 02:44:42 My friends from the UK understand what's going on here, considering they have Brexit supporters.

Remember, there's always a certain percentage of people that will buy snake oil from a good salesman. People are buying "Raw Water" after all.

8838 2018-01-18 02:42:19 "And mayors council wants it to replace gas taxes" Who other than an oil company would want to do that? Make driving a gas guzzling SUV relatively less expensive, and make an electric car relatively more expensive. Seems evil or insane to me.

1: How much oil actually spilled?
2: How much you will have to pay? 
3: How human health has been affected?
4: How the deep sea will fare?
5: Whether safety standards can really prevent another disaster?

8873 2018-01-18 02:37:15 “Woe is the oil industry” no, fuck the oil industry. Woe are the Alaskans who have lost their jobs. A stronger economy and stable State will help them recover; and if the oil industry benefits as well, that’s a bonus.
8874 2018-01-18 02:37:09 Exactly and Norway is oil rich from drilling in the Atlantic ocean, so they can afford to offer crappy socialist healthcare for all. We could drill too sharing the same ocean

8881 2018-01-18 02:36:37 We own a CRV and it was burning oil, about a quart per 1,000 miles. It turns out this is an issue with certain models of Honda and when the dealer documents that consumption, they will rebuild your engine for free. Warranty was extended for 8 years, 125,000 miles.
8882 2018-01-18 02:36:34 Well, some companies medical insurance do not even cover labor expenses for married women. Example: TI, and where Im at now, and many more. I think only most oil and gas companies do. 
Nevertheless, anyone who just gave labor deserves a good break from work. Fullstop.

8888 2018-01-18 02:35:23 It's been a tough winter so far. It can be hard to fill both your oil tank and your grocery cart.  Is their a known organized way to donate to this shortfall specifically without it going into a general fund?
8889 2018-01-18 02:35:21 These Repubs are just evil! They want to ruin our Monuments & National Parks for oil & fracking filth.

8890 2018-01-18 02:35:20 I am, you just aren’t listening. We need more revenue now. Immediately. If you disagree, you are flat out wrong.

More oil production in five years? Some new mines in ten? More tourism in twenty? Great, wonderful, we need that too. But *THIS YEAR* is in front of us now.
8891 2018-01-18 02:35:19 Coconut oil is dripping out of my hair onto my skin. I do not like this feeling. I repeat I do not like it.

8900 2018-01-18 02:33:40 The Bush family had ties to Schlumberger, a big oil company. Plus after 9/11, all air traffic was grounded, but private Arab jets were allowed to fly home. Doesn't that tell you something?
8901 2018-01-18 02:33:34 yeah i feel like the oil doesn't have to be warm
8902 2018-01-18 02:33:03 You do realize that private oil companies pay tax with no government compensation and that government provides Billions of dollars to start up tech companies that study Green Energy right ?
8903 2018-01-18 02:33:03 The link between tax and oil consumption can exist if the tax is high enough. The link between oil consumption and climate change is clear. It follows that a tax can curb emissions and limit climate change. So let’s make it a big tax to insure it’s successful.
8904 2018-01-18 02:32:54 脳みそがカニ味噌になってたり血液が特殊なOILだったりってのがバレて機械にいじくり倒されてくるの！？（笑）

8906 2018-01-18 02:32:31 I have heart strain and severe back problems so I used blue oil to heal the pain and it is AMAZING! Stress reliving blue oil helps dissolve tension and raise energy levels with the balancing aromas of refreshing peppermint and blue camomile.
8907 2018-01-18 02:32:20 OK.. just be careful, make sure it's got full service history, and get a three month warranty from the garage. And be sure to get the oil changed regularly, as the book scheduled says so.

Because Jake, I’m really sorry you had deliver my rosehip oil & books at 8pm when it’s freezing. I promise I use the stuff you bring me!
8917 2018-01-18 02:31:20 What I usually do is wash my face after you wake up and before you go to sleep which usually helps in washing away excess oil you face might have and also drinking plenty of water becuase if you have more water you'll have in your body, the less oil you'll have

8921 2018-01-18 02:30:51 No meats, no sweets, no dairy. Basically water fruits and veggies ONLY . No butter or cream, only olive oil and 100% wheat and fruit juices
8922 2018-01-18 02:30:41 If it was the OIL light, yeah, that'd be ultra bad. You can destroy your engine. But the engine light is not an emergency. My dad was a car mechanic. He taught me stuff, haha.

8930 2018-01-18 02:30:08 Exactly what I thought. Plus, Putin got himself a beautiful naval base in the Mediterranean now. He basically controls the oil traffic from the entire middle east now.

8978 2018-01-18 02:23:53 China provides 90% of N Korea’s trade. It’s not a “couple” attempts to skirt sanctions. Russia supplies so much oil that the price has plummeted in NKorea.

There is nothing valuable on this planet that is seperate from energy or work.

9021 2018-01-18 02:18:15 Use coconut oil to fry your foods in. Traditional oils are hydrogenated and that’s not good for your body at all. And heat ya shit on the stove and in da oven. Don’t use da microwave unless u REALLY have to. U welcome

9030 2018-01-18 02:17:11 It's a "purple" cleaner. Concrete from home Depot. The really bad spots get coated, scrubbed, covered in oil dry. The cleaner itself turns the grease into a goo.

Then more cleaner, soak the remains up with a mop.
9031 2018-01-18 02:17:10 Yeah! And that connects to the drive...shafter.

Look, I'm gonna be honest, cars are all just a bunch of shafts. See, it's easy. Oil? That goes in the oil shafter.
9032 2018-01-18 02:17:10 The government owns 50% of the banks, 100% of the entire energy enterprises (oil, electricity, water, mines, gas), they handle the entire money exchange market, Central Bank of Venezuela, 70% of food production enterprises, 100% manufactory like steel, cement, etc, etc, etc

9046 2018-01-18 02:15:32 I understand. My grandfather's tribe was declared extinct recently. Most Americans don't know of the governments push to extinguish NA ppl. Chemicals are dumped in their water and next to the boundaries. Lands they're promised stolen if oil organs or uranium is found.

9310 2018-01-18 01:44:03 Yeah, don't know why this is an issue. It's basic respect you've to give any individual. We even change the oil for frying veg snacks and non-veg snacks when we host a get together of people with different food habits. great that an instt is doing this!

9330 2018-01-18 01:42:49 with an astounding amount of oil reserves, Venezuela should be the most prosperous country in that region (the whole continent?). Socialism & corruption is killing them.

9388 2018-01-18 01:36:12 @VP remember when @realDonaldTrump claimed he was going to save all the Hoosier @Carrier jobs and then they just laid off a ton of people? What a total snake oil salesman. Blowhard and buffoon #Indiana

9390 2018-01-18 01:35:54 No now I feel like eating 3 spoons of warm oil
9391 2018-01-18 01:35:34 What are the provable oil reserves off Oregon’s coast? #LiveOnK2
9392 2018-01-18 01:35:31 Drill, but drill responsibly! And drill in the largest oil pockets
9393 2018-01-18 01:34:39 Thanks love! I’ve been trying to find something. I’ve been using my conditioner and coconut oil lmao
9394 2018-01-18 01:34:26 赤ずきんのってまだよね？
9395 2018-01-18 01:33:48 Can I check your oil...?
9396 2018-01-18 01:33:41 First time cooking with grapeseed oil
9397 2018-01-18 01:33:35 Also if you take Evening Primrose oil capsules, they will help moisturize everything (they are packed with Vitamin E!) Now, they are somewhat expensive and it takes about a month to see results, but they work really well and you can get them at Shoppers or wherever.
9398 2018-01-18 01:33:27 What is wrong in splitting. You know in the US McDonalds had to withdraw using same oil for veg burger and non veg burger. It is the same sentiment. What is so bad about what IIT Bombay introduced. I am surprised at this type of debates
9399 2018-01-18 01:33:08 My dad always made me laugh when I was a kid. He didn't think you should buy food made next to oil. Lmao
9400 2018-01-18 01:32:56 こういうキャラほんと無理なんだよな
9401 2018-01-18 01:32:46 Again, why do you believe the culprit is the oil industry? Do you indict farmers for our obesity problem?
9402 2018-01-18 01:32:43 Oil rigs are better for the lobbyists and their clients that are connected to 45.
9403 2018-01-18 01:32:41 Iraqis owe you nothing for years the #KRG has been stealing #kirkuk oil

9405 2018-01-18 01:32:37 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9406 2018-01-18 01:32:23 Nicki went thruuuuuuu some SHIT with that coconut oil selling ass nigga..... oh my god. Wow.
9407 2018-01-18 01:32:07 You people remind me of Jim Jones followers who despite all evidence to the contrary follow this lying narcissist braggart. They drank the Coolaid and u drink the snake oil .
9408 2018-01-18 01:32:07 Haa coconut oil on my face before bed makes my skin so smoothhhh..
9409 2018-01-18 01:32:02 リピートしますわ・・・

9411 2018-01-18 01:31:53 i need somebody to put some oil in my head
9412 2018-01-18 01:31:48 To get oil 
9413 2018-01-18 01:31:47 1. I found one product give lot of  benefits to me n family- Young Living Essential Oil. 
2. Both of my children go to school. The little brother 5 years old was crying this morning. I hope everything going well.
3. I'm here in my office. Working.
9414 2018-01-18 01:31:37 I need connection to the oil and gas industry
9415 2018-01-18 01:31:37 Oh gosh I lay on my bed, the feeling of clean sheets, clean room, vanilla x frankincense essential oil in my diffuser. 

Thank you universe for this day.
9416 2018-01-18 01:31:01 I'll prepare with extra food, milk, and heating oil.  Appreciate the heads up!
9417 2018-01-18 01:30:57 I don’t know if I believe the whole “Zinke did it to help his oil friends” theory, but as an outdoorsman I just feel like it should be adequately accessible to everyone. Not free, but not almost $80+ for a single day/car
9418 2018-01-18 01:30:53 Coconut oil will solve all my problems
9419 2018-01-18 01:30:33 Men need good cleansers, too. Look for a gentle option that gets rid of dirt and oil and hydrates while it cleans. #bestfacialproducts

9429 2018-01-18 01:29:15 Put some oil on a q tip and rub it across the the lash band. It should come off a lot easier without tugging your skin or lashes!
9430 2018-01-18 01:29:03 Get the special butter oil don’t use regular oil and it will be closer to the movie theater popcorn.
9431 2018-01-18 01:28:47 God damn snake oil salesman carnival barker bitch.
9432 2018-01-18 01:28:42 Tri-tip steak, dump a bottle of cheap red wine in pot, tablespoon olive oil, tablespoon garlic, set to low. 8-ish hours. Enjoy! 
9433 2018-01-18 01:27:49 Psalm 23:5-6 NASB
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows. [6] Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
9434 2018-01-18 01:27:44 If they take the coast they also take the oil and shipping industry. The intent is secede from the U.S. Elites are never for middle America. They’ve talked about it for years, but recently it’s been heating up.
9435 2018-01-18 01:27:40 Oil subsidies
9436 2018-01-18 01:27:39 I hope you do and have great success at it. Meanwhile, BTC is succumbing to the same commodity speculation mess that have bitten the common person in the rear as housing, gold, oil, long term employment, et al.

9441 2018-01-18 01:27:12 You're talking about a president who said he was going to drain the swamp but brought in the CEOs of the biggest banks and oil companies that have already been secretly running our government and continue the revolving door.
9442 2018-01-18 01:27:05 ｱｯｱｯ
9443 2018-01-18 01:26:44 You have point their even my astma steem from shit air because we still burn expensive oil. Ironicaly I got into spirituality to deal with that lost of control. My obsetion with it is unhealthy and need to accept somethings are out of my control and just focus on what I can do.
9444 2018-01-18 01:26:22 And we can't get the right ingredients here in America!!!!
Try finding πρόβιο γιαούρι (Goat yogurt) or Thyme Honey, or REAL olive oil.
(Now I'm going to have to spend $2000 for a trip to Greece again - I'm hungry!)
9445 2018-01-18 01:26:13 Lmao you know there's Spartan brand motor oil?
9446 2018-01-18 01:26:06 Have you tried any topicals or straight CBD oil? Cbd helps more with inflammation and pain. Most typical medicinal strains have little cbd in them unless cultivated to have more. Try concentrates, tinctures, edibles. It may help better via a diff route than smoking.
9447 2018-01-18 01:26:05 Blasio doesn’t WANT to sue oil and gas concerns, he wants payola from them. Follow the $$$$$$$$$$$$ to a democrat. They are all corrupt all the time.
9448 2018-01-18 01:25:53 Y'all stole diamonds oil  kill for ivory.  Blacks raped black women. Whites in Africa now smh 
9449 2018-01-18 01:25:30 @RealDonaldTrump Will that be based, ongoing stealing of BIAFRA Jews and Christians oil in West Africa. France has forgotten LIBERTY . REFERENDUM for true FREEDOM.
9450 2018-01-18 01:24:51 You know you're a relaxed fan when your thoughts were mostly criticizing the cooking choices in RUN 36 like how Hobi didn't use oil, Jin and SESAME SEEDS™, V and RM had like no idea what they was doin and JK cuts too closely to his hand

9451 2018-01-18 01:24:32 We do have an Aldi possibly opening across the street from where I’m getting my oil changed tomorrow! So that might be a fun adventure!
9452 2018-01-18 01:24:09 I seriously need a stock of coconut oil
9453 2018-01-18 01:23:51 I never really saw results with that Bahi sunflower oil but I see y’all love it. I wanna try it again..... how did y’all like it
9454 2018-01-18 01:23:51 Why does oil of oregano taste so terrible?
9455 2018-01-18 01:23:19 hahaha... china oil contract..
9456 2018-01-18 01:23:09 Every oil is palm oil if you use it to masturbate.
9457 2018-01-18 01:22:46 I'm hungry and all we have in this apartment is peanut butter, beer, and chickpeas. Oh and some olive oil
9458 2018-01-18 01:22:41 Glad you donated it too. I have done it many times! Even it is just the trimmings to help with oil spills
9459 2018-01-18 01:22:29 @RangarajPandeyR : You appear to be adding oil to the fume in the vairamuthu issue.  Are you still saying you have a chief editorial ethics/discipline ? Time will put you in situations too
9460 2018-01-18 01:22:17 One of the reasons for current independence of oil prices futures from the stock market may be found in the following article in full, with an excerpt below : 三是中国正在原油定价中发挥越来越重要的“稳定锚”作用。美国能源革命发生后，中国正在超越美国成为世界第一大原油进口国，保障进
9461 2018-01-18 01:22:17 Oh, and oil isn’t $120/barrell anymore either. In an undiversified economy, it’s easy to place blame when the sole product tour economy relies on was at its peak.... worth twice as much as it is today, actually.
9462 2018-01-18 01:22:16 U oil want changing 
Bye
9463 2018-01-18 01:22:06 Absolutely. You don’t scrape by to buy a car you can’t afford to get oil changes on, and you don’t adopt an animal expecting that it will never get sick or hurt. It’s a whole life you’re responsible for.
9464 2018-01-18 01:22:03 I will never pay for a oil change lol
9465 2018-01-18 01:21:55 That’s what happens when you hire an oil company exec with no diplomatic/foreign policy experience to run the nation’s State Department . . .
9466 2018-01-18 01:21:50 No.
There is still oil left outside the USA.

Enough to heist!
9467 2018-01-18 01:21:47 Bio Oil is your friend, if there’s nothing left in the spot and it’s just a scab - really massage it into the area and leave overnight. I’m a picker too and it made a huge difference!
9468 2018-01-18 01:21:21 Coconut oil works wonders
9469 2018-01-18 01:21:12 Whenever I need a laugh I think of the lady who got stuck in her tub after taking a coconut oil bath
9470 2018-01-18 01:21:09 Because of oil
9471 2018-01-18 01:21:08 *Exudes jealous-infused oil splotches all over the basement floor*
9472 2018-01-18 01:21:03 You R A racist rapist adulterous bigot who is dividing the country!    Economic gains R Obama gains.  U deported an equal rights activist who has been here legally for 31 years!  Walmart closed stores.  Oil spills. Fires. No power in PR. Raised taxes in most areas!  Winning yet?
9473 2018-01-18 01:21:02 If it was possible to #MAGA by increasing taxes, stop all oil drilling in US, send more jobs overseas and opening boarders Im sure u wd do it, but it doesnt wor like that
9474 2018-01-18 01:20:42 I’m testing this week along with the facial oil, I would say maybe 2 weeks!
9475 2018-01-18 01:20:39 Tbh I’m just waiting for the Black superhero show that’s aiding the proletariat resistance 

And isn’t the clean up crew of the state 

Someone who busts down some prisons, jail cells, destroy the server of Sally Mae, takes out Monsanto, the Koch Brothers, oil pipelines

ijs.....
9476 2018-01-18 01:20:29 It's been a while since I made a batch, and this winter weather calla for long luxurious hot baths with Shea butter, coconut oil, and essential oils!
9477 2018-01-18 01:20:15 It’s more than that @penniryn  Elites want to control oil & shipping etc. by eventually seceding from the U.S. By doing it in a 2 California situation it’s easier to do. The Elites never sacrifice anything but their values.
9478 2018-01-18 01:20:05 How much coconut oil do I need to put on my life to fix it?
9479 2018-01-18 01:20:02 Chicken and Andouille Sausage, BellPeppers, Jalapeños, Onions, Cherry Tomato’s, Cajan Spices, Olive Oil and Parmesan over Penne pasta.
9480 2018-01-18 01:20:01 ขอบคุณ
9481 2018-01-18 01:19:51 60 minutes? I hope the comes with oil and lube job too...
9482 2018-01-18 01:19:44 I have always wondered what oil they used for this
9483 2018-01-18 01:19:36 I agree, that’s why the USA needs to stop pumping trillions of dollars into overseas wars, the military industrial complex and oil subsidies for billionaire donors. It would cost far less to integrate DREAMers than to spend billions in court fees and gestapo like deportations.
9484 2018-01-18 01:19:31 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww

9486 2018-01-18 01:19:05 Wtf cares you blow a historic lead to an above avg team in your own building. You broke your fan bases heart again. Tell the hunts to pretend they are drilling for oil and that if you don't find any that is there you are toast

- camp out at Howard’s financial aid office

9503 2018-01-18 01:16:16 Part of the reason people aren't talking a whole lot about the damage Murphy Oil vs NLRB will cause non-unionized workers is bc even non-profits that think they're "organizing", aren't really actually organizing.
9504 2018-01-18 01:15:53 What's the matter? Can't you argue using facts? I'm not mad. Trump isn't taking advantage of me. He's using you. And when the illusion all comes crashing down around you, still you won't realize that you've been had by a snake oil salesman. You'll blame all your problems on me.
9505 2018-01-18 01:15:31 I feel like such an adult, went and got my oil changed, grocery shopping and looked into setting up a new insurance policy 
9506 2018-01-18 01:15:06 I need help! (If you did) How did you grow out your eyebrows! I used to do the whole castor oil thing, but I want to know if there is another way.
9507 2018-01-18 01:15:05 I’m not sure yet  I want to test it for a few days first and make my facial oil to accompany it.
9508 2018-01-18 01:15:03 He is a manipulator. A snake oil salesmen. He works the crowd but sooner (probably later) the illusion is gone. Ask any of the banks that have ever loaned him a dime.

9512 2018-01-18 01:14:23 Y’all made fun of me in high school for talking about coconut oil so much guess who’s a soft ass bitch now!!!!
9513 2018-01-18 01:14:20 What a scam! Half of these Elites want to divide the state, and the other half wants to secede from the U.S. 

Bet it’s the Coastal half that wants to secede & control the oil & shipping resources.!
9514 2018-01-18 01:14:17 That’s it, nailed. He’s a snake oil salesman. A shameless self promoter, that doesn’t want to work at it
9515 2018-01-18 01:14:04 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
9516 2018-01-18 01:14:03 When you go to put a couple of drops of oil into a diffuser and accidentally tip the entire bottle in. That. #lemongrass #expatproblems
9517 2018-01-18 01:13:59 Instead of letting anger fester inside of me I fix/clean things. I just unclogged my sink and gave my car an oil change now I can breathe and head to work.
9518 2018-01-18 01:13:58 I agree. Not that I’ve seen a whole hydrophobic repertoire. Oil and vinegar my prosaic go-to.
9519 2018-01-18 01:13:55 That you had, but had no success, especially with using oil as a cleanser. It even took me ages to find any skincare brands while in Japan bc all the young women in Lumine said they just use Bioré. I just think it should be clearer that it was only inspired by Japanese ..

9525 2018-01-18 01:12:32 Has gas & oil interests only. Tried to sue the EPA a dozen times. Fits 45's hiring profile. Find the one person who hates (pick department), with the most to gain by changing it & make him the boss.
9526 2018-01-18 01:12:15 Also? There’s a small tingling sensation while you cleanse your face, I would follow up with a moisturizer then a facial oil to seal

9528 2018-01-18 01:12:01 #CapeTownWaterCrisis We got plenty of water here in Johannesburg (Vaal). Similar to how oil's transferred across countries using pipelines, can we not also construct a "water" pipeline alongside existing N1 freeway (infrastructure already there) & pump water to CT. Is it possible
9529 2018-01-18 01:11:13 Who loves sesame oil? I love sesame oil
9530 2018-01-18 01:11:12 If you select the right ones, you can eat raw artichokes (the soft part of each leaf) and fava beans. Also cauliflower and red cabbage and fennel. A good alternative is sautéing with oil, garlic (and possibly chili): works for broccoli rabe, broccoli and cauliflower.
9531 2018-01-18 01:11:12 PMHarper promised to do what he could on Senate reform and he delivered where he could. 

As for entitlements, PMHarper cut his own pension while Justin took free trips from lobbyists and forced charities to pay him to speak while a sitting MP. Lol Liberals secrete snake oil

9534 2018-01-18 01:10:58 That's why when oil price goes up significantly it always leads to recession and inflation.

The ever expanding dollar is starting to bump up against the laws of physics. (Thermodynamics)

9539 2018-01-18 01:10:37 Actually earthquakes can be blamed on the quest for oil. Fraking is a process of extracting oil from rock & has been linked to more frequent earthquakes. Government and oil companies are to blame.

It is truly a one of a kind, beautiful film to behold, and an incredible artistic achievement to boot.

9671 2018-01-18 00:50:37 Roasted with truffle oil!
9672 2018-01-18 00:50:33 Eh bukan. Ika beli yg memg rose water spray and oil 
9673 2018-01-18 00:50:29 @JustinTrudeau You are wrong to support oil tankers along our coastlines. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
9674 2018-01-18 00:50:26 I drizzle truffle oil on mine when i make it-  i baked it in the oven
9675 2018-01-18 00:49:53 Came to get an oil change and the guy kept offering to buy my Beamer off of me 
9676 2018-01-18 00:49:42 But Brussel Sprouts are my favorite in the whole wide world. Roasted with olive oil and salt occasionally sprinkled w/ parmesan cheese

9679 2018-01-18 00:49:34 Trump vs athletes with similar weight and height: simple.
One is built of muscle, the other is full of hot air. And other stuff like lard,  frying oil, and ketchup.
9680 2018-01-18 00:49:30 When I tell yall that getting a candy thermometer to make sure your oil is hot enough to fry your chicken makes a world of difference... it's life changing. Truly.
9681 2018-01-18 00:49:26 Pour les couleurs je te conseille le Oil paint flat brush (perso mes configs pour celui ci c'est tout au max sauf la stabilisation)
9682 2018-01-18 00:49:07 i put oregano essential oil along with other oils in my diffuser, and my entire fucking room smells like sweet oregano and it's getting me TIGHHHHTTTTT

9688 2018-01-18 00:48:32 I'm still trying to grasp the whole: 'let's throw every possible fruit combination at your hair because 'vitamins and minerals' therefore 'healthy shine'" when it's probably just soap, touch of oil and chemical fragrance.
9689 2018-01-18 00:48:11 Acutely aware I am a slave. Not free though. Need affordable place to shut it down w/lots of legal THC oil or dope. Turn my brain to mush so I can't be controlled and abused by assholes anymore w/this technology. That or Seroquel or death. Know of a place? #Cannabis #Help #TheEnd
9690 2018-01-18 00:48:07 No sir, I’m not counting oil changes or brakes that’s normal shit every car needs. My E30 is built like a tank and has never failed me. Next

9696 2018-01-18 00:47:42 The US dollar does. Big Fancy Guns. Also one may only physically trade oil in dollars (ultimately)
9697 2018-01-18 00:47:40 I’m putting Elin to bed and Justin just came home from working 12 hours. I have cleaned all day. Since he’s walked in the door I have heard him sweep, spray cleaner, clean the two plates that were in the sink, start the oil diffuser, put up the ham and shower....
9698 2018-01-18 00:47:37 .@antonio4ca scheduled to appear on "CNN Tonight" w/ @donlemon in the 8 p.m. hour PST. The candidate for #CAGov has been critical of the Trump administration's push to expand offshore oil drilling.
9699 2018-01-18 00:47:32 缶コーヒー作るときは一度熱くしてから、密閉して自動的に冷えるから酸化が防がれるが…
ペットボトルは、熱いままだと融解しちゃうから、無理やり冷ますから(密閉じゃないため酸化する)じゃねぇかな？と独自理解している。

というわけでMaxコーヒーは、コーヒーではない。
9700 2018-01-18 00:47:29 I thought they were tying bows around bottles of motor oil.
9701 2018-01-18 00:47:23 If anyone wanted to drop me off coconut oil and desitin I’d be forever grateful considering there’s no way I’m leaving the house with these atrocious blotches all over my face

9703 2018-01-18 00:47:15 I need clarification is this garbage white pizza that thinks ricotta is a saucestitute or proper white pizza that's just olive oil and salt and maybe some herbs?

@Mark_Sisson says "Not Primal, but it’s not the worst cheat snack you can have" for Paleo (not Keto).  

Not all popcorn is created equal.

9709 2018-01-18 00:46:31 #naturalgas the fuel for the 21st Century. Super cargo ships that pollute as much as 50 million cars each year should be burning natural gas now and not dirty oil.

9770 2018-01-18 00:35:36 I’ve noticed that mine grows faster if I get it wet and put a bunch of coconut oil in it and leave it in for about an hour. Makes it super soft and helps with split ends too! Just make sure you shampoo it twice when you’re done or your hair will look greasy!! 
9771 2018-01-18 00:35:32 Mine, too. RW groups are so flush with oligarch oil money, they can afford to troll us, I mean advertise, 24/7. Remember they pay for each engagement.

9773 2018-01-18 00:35:20 Turn the cause work class one to oil and let our conscience in the long-cherished drive!
9774 2018-01-18 00:35:11 And a trillion $$ wealth fund from their oil reserves.  We could really use a bunch of those ourselves.
9775 2018-01-18 00:34:41 He admitted before the referendum that he didn’t think the budget was viable. Salmond swept it under the carpet. There are leaked pictures of the calculations somewhere. Maybe @AgentP22 knows where they are? That was based on better oil revenues too
9776 2018-01-18 00:34:38 hmm, interesting!
- wash it
- chop into large pieces
- grate into "rice"
- press in towel to dry
- sautee in oil, covered, 5-8 min
9777 2018-01-18 00:34:34 I like the clove oil, but  my teeth are already wrecked. I use ibupropen & pain killers & hope the infection calms down.
9778 2018-01-18 00:34:34 Once Oil becomes a commodity like Coal when motor vehicles switch to batteries, the salience of Saudi Arabia & other oil producing countries in middle-east will flip. Wahhabism and Terrorism associated with it runs on Dollars.

9829 2018-01-18 00:27:41 There are enormous socio-economic cleavages in the UAE. Wealth is not distributed evenly. Collectively, Abu Dhabi and Dubai control 83.2 percent of the UAE's GDP in large part because of Abu Dhabi's large oil production and Dubai's oil supply and commercial base.

9834 2018-01-18 00:26:54 When you're cooking, another fun hack is to use butter in the pan rather than oil / non-stick spray. Adds a more natural flavor, and it can really help keep food from sticking.
9835 2018-01-18 00:26:34 To get rid of my nose piercing bump should I use straight tea tree oil or should I dilute it? Or should I use somethignelse entirely?
9836 2018-01-18 00:26:16 It is important to remember that just as some nations need to avoid USD, some market commentators need a hyperbolic narrative to drive their views. The oil/cny/gold link is perfect! The contract symbol to be OMGh18. Everybody gets to be happy!   Cheers!

9863 2018-01-18 00:22:30 Coconut oil is tricky depending on who you ask. It works for some people, but not everybody and castor oil is a super heavy oil so you have to use a light hand. The oils I listed are not too light, not too heavy and are ideal for your hai, especially since you wear it straight.

9868 2018-01-18 00:21:00 Barbara, you are clueless, alternative energy is what’s subsidized so that it can maybe have a chance at competing economically with oil. What you are calling subsidies are tax breaks or credits within the tax system that any company or industry can claim.

9875 2018-01-18 00:20:28 (2/2) Raimi: I think because the technologies were first used to produce shale gas. Oil is also much more complex because you must consider global economic and geopolitical factors.
9876 2018-01-18 00:20:27 yessum i’ll be slinging olive oil bright n early
9877 2018-01-18 00:20:15 Sure that seems like a lot, but you might get to see oil drilling, strip mining or even fracking up close.
9878 2018-01-18 00:20:08 (1/2) Question from the audience: Why do we tend to focus on natural gas rather than oil in the fracking debate?

9958 2018-01-18 00:09:58 Birdman is the funniest dude ever. He literally used to just make up business ventures n how much money he had made off them. In an interview he said he had made 100 million of a few oil “flips” like its a pound of weed lmfao

9965 2018-01-18 00:09:16 Tillerson spent his career causing disruption in the countries with oil markets.   He's making money for the rich as I type.   He could give a rip about you.
9966 2018-01-18 00:09:11 A major fire broke out onboard the MT Genessa oil tanker anchored 15 nautical miles off Deendayal Port at Kandla. All 26 crew members were evacuated safely, officials said. Two of them suffered burn injuries. #mtgenessa #fire #oiltanker

9972 2018-01-18 00:07:43 Yeah try an oil by itself or use an oil blend with some of those oils and just massage it into your scalp. It'll be able to penetrate better. Grease don't do nothing but sit on your scalp and create buildup. 
9973 2018-01-18 00:07:32 OIL DIFF: 5.26 -> 5.46
9974 2018-01-18 00:07:31 Hey, thank you! I've been drawing for a long time, but last fall was my first experience with oil painting.

9980 2018-01-18 00:06:15 Potatoes can be cut into millions of tiny pieces, rolled in oil and tossed on a fire and STILL come out as the most fabulous version of themselves... #LifeAsAPotato
9981 2018-01-18 00:06:04 Midnight Oil's hits ought to be added to the playlist, eg. Dreamworld, My Country, Forgotten Years.
9982 2018-01-18 00:06:01 RT @SenatorHeitkamp: North Dakota’s #1 export to Canada & Mexico is oil and gas, which makes protecting NAFTA critical to preserving jobs and economic growth in our state.
9983 2018-01-18 00:05:44 Coconut oil has saved my skin
9984 2018-01-18 00:05:15 I really like the @Forever35pod but *whispers* I don’t know what a serum is 

For real, my skin care routine is some Neutrogena face wash in the shower and good ol’ Oil of Olay. 

But apparently I love listening to people TALK about serums.
9985 2018-01-18 00:05:07 How about telling Americans we must stop drilling and using up the last drops. In fact tell us the oil levels without lying to the American people. We all ready Being fed lied about #climatechange. Ty

9988 2018-01-18 00:04:58 This office smells vaguely of oil paint and plants. 
It always has.
I'm just able to put words to it now.
9989 2018-01-18 00:04:56 Niggas souls need coconut oil. They spirit be ashy as hell.

9994 2018-01-18 00:04:23 @RickRoss and @Therealkiss really made a masterpiece with Oil Money Gang. Shit is still transcendent to this day.
9995 2018-01-18 00:04:16 Manias: it happened for tulips; housing; oil; etc. Human nature hasn't changed in thousands of years and won't change next month. Heck there's 45% more upside for the bubble, right?
9996 2018-01-18 00:04:00 @whole30 can you tell me what type of juice is ok to drink? I don't have my book on me  but I need a chaser for this mineral oil I have to take so is there anything that's compliant that I can buy to take just a few sips a day? Sugarless tea ain't cutting it
9997 2018-01-18 00:03:47 Fraud, medicine man, probably sells snake oil too.
9998 2018-01-18 00:03:45 It was used!
9999 2018-01-18 00:03:45 They will launch the oil contract when and only when, its in their best interest to do so.

10008 2018-01-18 00:02:59 My point was it should off been used! UpTheChels #KTBFFH
10009 2018-01-18 00:02:55 Too real. People shill for coconut oil SO hard. I personally find it great for moisturising my body, but NOT for my face- too comedogenic. I swear some people act like it's a cure for cancer or something
10010 2018-01-18 00:02:49 Unfortunately it’s true. However, in the north you have ditches. Down here, we live in the ditch and you can only fall into the Gulf of Mexico at 100% humidity. If the guard rail doesn’t kill you first that is. Oil/gas plants are cracking, and fires are erupting. #GlobalWarming

10013 2018-01-18 00:02:22 American foreign policy is pretty much the same under all administrations.Regime change,controlling oil and putting in place puppet regimes.
10014 2018-01-18 00:02:12 Please, everyone we need to spread the word about what is being done to our great nation by these idiots. Our precious national treasures are being given to oil, gas, and mining companies to destroy so the republicans can keep their big energy buddies happy and flush with cash.

10017 2018-01-18 00:02:02 Marina Granovskaia, right hand of Roman Abramovich, heirs of the big oil fortune, queen of the seven kingdoms...  Right hand yes, Diretor of some sort too, brings in and finalizes every player deal.
10018 2018-01-18 00:01:58 Bad business moves. Remember the "oil company"?
