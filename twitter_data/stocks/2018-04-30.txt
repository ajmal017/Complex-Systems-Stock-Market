37 2018-04-30 23:34:46 Normal for a True Market Leader to pull back 10-15% from 25% gain. Consider these:
- position size vs portfolio.
- risk tolerance.
- Is it a TML candidate? For most stocks, better to take 20-25% gain.
- Not an all-or-nothing game. May Take partial profit & let the rest run.

125 2018-04-30 22:12:51 Actually you are mistaken because he did hush for a ban of bump stocks and in addition to that he has talked about both armed security and armed teachers all of which will help school safety. Sorry your facts are not facts.

254 2018-04-30 20:37:01 A study that begins with "Fish stocks are owned by no one and desired by many" is balanced?

If fish stocks are owned by no one, why has the EU buy fishing rights off Africa for years?
255 2018-04-30 20:33:37 In the past, companies opted to use tax cuts as a way to buy back stocks n product or give higher ups huge bonuses rather than spread the wealth in workers pay

270 2018-04-30 20:23:25 what about free condoms that everyone stocks up on? no one is talking about how that "eats into tuition" huh.. I'd rather have pads over condoms any day cuz unlike sex, menstrual cycle is something I can't control (and before someone tells me to take birth control, just don't)
271 2018-04-30 20:22:56 That's why ovoD has to be kept as a "stock" with attached-X females (XXY) and ovoD/y males - the only viable offspring are always XXY females or ovoD males (same principle for the autosomal ovoD stocks - kept "balanced" with autosomal dominant male sterility genes)

278 2018-04-30 20:19:19 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +.2%; US -.8%. US reversed several days of gains as investors may be sated by good earnings & returned focus to trade & political dysfunction. Volatility will be ever present but disciplined investors will be rewarded albeit nowhere near 2017.

284 2018-04-30 20:16:17 anyone know why $HVBTF was down today even though bitcoin related stocks were up?
285 2018-04-30 20:16:14 Whenever #highyieldbonds sell off and stocks rally, the bears tell us high yield is the "smart" market-leading signal; so as high yield bonds rally and stocks flounder - like today - are we suppose to love stocks? Somehow I doubt our stock haters are that logically consistent.
286 2018-04-30 20:16:11 Let's correct those assertions, the man taking credit for N&S Korea talking, continued Obama's economic trends, for stocks and employment, the man who has created no new anti-terrorist programs, except for a Visa ban. Pretty sure none of that looks like Peace Prize material.

299 2018-04-30 20:10:01 I disagree. Tokens are not stocks, they are stakes in a community. What is really missing is an incentive to HODL, i.e a reward for HODLing a coin thru thick and thin, because those HODLers are the community without which there is no network, just an open source algorithm. #HODL

305 2018-04-30 20:07:24 Let’s compare #crypto to stocks shall we? Specifically #bitcoin

In 1 year:
- $TSLA - $315 to $295 = -6%
- $NFLX - $150 to $314 = 109%
- $AMZN - $930 to $1571 = 69%
- $BTC - $1350 to $9300 = 588%

Are you paying attention yet?

343 2018-04-30 19:40:14 Gold is a barren asset and bonds are seldom rewarding to investors. Well chosen productive assets like common stocks and land (at the correct prices) are logical investments for those looking to grow their wealth long term ahead of inflation.
344 2018-04-30 19:38:15 Of course. I approached crypto the same way I approached stocks. Only put in what ya can loose.
345 2018-04-30 19:37:36 Thank you James, I’m on a roll at the minute but with a lot of those stocks at highs it may lose a little steam.  I’m looking at a few stocks to replace some top heavy holdings.

390 2018-04-30 19:00:39 All those tax cuts for corporations went for stock buybacks with a “symbolic” gesture of bonuses to make headlines. Sure the stocks in my 401K went up but crumbs compared the what big shareholders made. Not proportionate at all. The 1% made out like bandits.

399 2018-04-30 18:54:37 The stock market has NOT pushed higher b/c of a stock-to-bond flow. Some institutional investors attracted by 3% interest in 10-year bonds have sold stocks & moved to 10-year Treasuries.

411 2018-04-30 18:46:28 If you bought $100 worth of bitcoin last april, it'd be worth $900 today. If you buy $100 worth today, it could be worth $1,000 by next year. 401k, stocks, savings accounts, they just can't compete with those kind of gains. And that's just with Bitcoin, not even getting into alts

413 2018-04-30 18:46:05 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
414 2018-04-30 18:46:03 The wealthy do not become wealthier by investing in stocks, they get wealthier by investing in the imprisonment of the workers.
415 2018-04-30 18:45:49 Time to buy #CRYPTO .. stocks imploding next weeks!
416 2018-04-30 18:45:47 WOW, -95% is a lot. That takes a lot of time i think to come to this high Level. I try also to buy cheap but to buy the real hated stocks is too hardcore for me now !
417 2018-04-30 18:45:00 Thinking about adding to portfolios, thoughts? Not sure the best play - I like ETFs but factors like contango can cause problems. Relative to stocks, commodities are least expensive sine the 60s.
418 2018-04-30 18:43:26 politicians: Hey corporations, if we give you this tax break will you reinvest in workers?

corporations: I guess we could but we will probably just buy back stocks and fill our bank

*4 months later, cut to befuddled politicians wondering what went wrong*
419 2018-04-30 18:42:40 Watching the press fall over itself trying to reconcile the reality that we're in a dystopian future being ruled by should-be laughing stocks with the false equivalence they've fostered over the past two years is why @michelleisawolf is the hero we need.
420 2018-04-30 18:42:30 I can't tell you how many folks I see are touting this, and likely have their entire portfolio riding on AAPL "saving" the market tomorrow.  It's a one-stock market to many, not a market of stocks.

423 2018-04-30 18:40:38 I understand everyone has different tool. Still I like to know any mechanical routine that you lie to use. On watch FSLR (or AMZN, TWLO) to sell - How do you do? I suppose you employ an alert set on a pre-chosen stop price point, but not on stocks that you have no positions?

431 2018-04-30 18:38:56 This needs to be said and reinforced more. If anyone is watching the buys and sells on stocks while following some of the usual suspects on Twitter, your going to find a weird correlation around the buy/sell info (tweets often fail to support actuals on a particular stock).
432 2018-04-30 18:38:17 Wow hunny. I’ll keep listening to the real progress that’s happening in our country. Obviously you don’t follow stocks or anything outside your liberal agenda. Oh yeah and btw North Korea isn’t going to start a nuclear war now, so remind me again what Obama did. Right, Nothing.
433 2018-04-30 18:37:48 I like what you said about mute, hadn't crossed my mind. I also think both ESAM and MVD's stocks will drop as they aren't in as skill-rich of a region to stay sharp.

458 2018-04-30 18:17:37 False.

495 2018-04-30 17:53:29 Certainly not a crap shoot. Many crapper stocks without license higher mktcap.The problem IMO is the low float so when there isn’t big sector hype it tends to fall too much due to less buying pressure. Although a bit disappointing today, I hold it long and expect it to pay off.

501 2018-04-30 17:47:54 If you want to make predictions about the future of oil, recognise that EVERYTHING is cyclical: 
* investment  
* production growth 
 * consumption growth  
* efficiency/conservation  
* costs 
* prices 
* stocks  
* inventories 
* exploration 
* refining margins

593 2018-04-30 16:56:51 So the important question to ask is the following. What has the power to lift stocks now? Great earnings and good news won't do the trick. FED is raising rates and unwinding it's balance sheets. Bond also get attractive again and hence competing with stocks! So what is left?
594 2018-04-30 16:56:39 @AskRobinhood 
Hey.

So you're telling me there is a 3-6 day settling period before your stocks can be withdrawable, and then another 3 day waiting period for the withdrawed funds to appear in your bank account? This seems a tad long. But I'd like some clarification please.

643 2018-04-30 16:30:43 Yes, I own stocks in several companies. I don't actually own the company and have no say in day to day operations. There's a difference between investing to get a ROI and actually owning the company or asset.  People smarter than you and I will decide this in court very soon.

652 2018-04-30 16:27:23 The only difference between @WarrenBuffett and @MohnishPabrai versus the rest of the investing follower crowd is an absolute understanding of 'the business of stocks', apart from 'the business of a business'. It's fun to learn about this from @edgemonktrading

767 2018-04-30 15:34:52 I suppose I’ve always known that value indexes don’t significantly outperform other indexes. I think this is due to: (1) passive portfolio management; and (2) the very large number of stocks in all indexes — you’re buying the market regardless of how the index is labeled

1035 2018-04-30 13:13:02 @HalftimeReport  I see that Western Digital dropped over $7 last week. Another lousy Steve Weiss pick. Weiss is a loser. He is clueless about stocks. CNBC needs to wake up & replace him.

1037 2018-04-30 13:12:54 Do stocks end negative today because investors don't want to hold on to securities at months end?  Looks like we will find out.  #StockMarket #investing #dowjones #money
1038 2018-04-30 13:12:16 This is an important issue; this is yet one more example of the most corrupt adm ever. Money over environment. Ichan is trump’s bff who sold steel stocks  right before tarrifs announced. Ahh. The swamp

1040 2018-04-30 13:11:21 $SPY We all make mistakes. One of the most stupid things I've ever done trading is waking up at 9:30 AM and then buying at the open, sure winning stocks.  :)  Don't repeat these type of mistakes too often!
1041 2018-04-30 13:09:27 Avoid..focus on quality stocks like ITC, Marico etc..don’t waste your time and money on manipulated stocks
1042 2018-04-30 13:08:47 Wonder how it will trade today?

1043 2018-04-30 13:08:43 then why only handful of stocks are beaten? look at vakrangee where it is? stocks just dont fall 100 200 or 300%...Imagine who has invested his fortune in PC at 600..

1046 2018-04-30 13:05:37 Quite a gift on top of the advance notice he got to dump his steel stocks. And that was a crime. But this probably do, I'm sure there was or will be  a nice little gift for Grifter Pruitt.

1057 2018-04-30 13:00:28 I prefer taking money out of markets. Like I like booking profits in stocks no other reason. That's the way I have liked and that's the way how things have worked for me so far. One can go with Growth too if one wants.
1058 2018-04-30 12:58:56 Wealth is goods and services, as well as property such as land, stocks, bonds, buildings, etc. Wealth is our basic material needs and other assets. Wealth gives us opportunities not already provided by human rights.
1059 2018-04-30 12:57:44 We support 2A.just not AR15S, BUMP STOCKS. mags >10, lack of universal background chks, Unregulated private sales, registry of all weapons, limits on # of guns purchased, etc. But ur right to arm urself for defensive purposes is ur right.

1062 2018-04-30 12:56:43 My oldest boy is taking a Financial Literacy class this year. He says it's the most informative class he's had. (He's a freshman in high school) Learned taxes, banking, budgets, stocks, a whole bunch of actual real world stuff.
1063 2018-04-30 12:56:41 It's Actally true. If he didn't get campaign donations & sell all of his stocks he would of had to file for bankruptcy again. The whole idea of running for president was to make money & he even said he would be the first candidate to make money

1168 2018-04-30 11:32:47 U.S. stock futures were up on strong tech earnings and as investors turned their focus towards a bunch of M&A deals. Consumer spending data is scheduled for release later in the day. Global stocks made gains, buoyed by a summit between North and South Korean leaders on Friday.
1169 2018-04-30 11:32:34 UK supermarkets are seen as "defensive" stocks. People will always buy food & most buy it from supermarkets. Therefore the risk of sharp unexpected capital losses from investing in e.g. Sainsburys is seen as low & is part of most big investors balanced portfolio.

1347 2018-04-30 08:39:07 Reviewing stocks in our fraud basket. There are few which have fallen 75%+ from their peaks in the last year. But there are also those which have gone up 2.5-5x. 

Overall, investing in the fraud portfolio would still have given decent returns. Wonder till when does that last.

1371 2018-04-30 08:15:57 Your definition of focus is number of stocks. Kotak defines focus as number of sectors. What's wrong in that ? You can always make a tonne of money by investing in the funds that you just named. There is no coercion here

1414 2018-04-30 07:38:51 There is a reason for this. When I had spoken to Harsha some months ago, he had told me that the  'concentrated' strategy is at the sector level (4-9).

1531 2018-04-30 05:16:41 @PartsUnknownCNN gun nuts are the ones that don't want a middle ground.  They asininely see any regulation as equal to taking all guns away. Most Americans want bump stocks, high capacity magazines and AR-15 type rifles to be illegal, not handguns, shotguns and hunting rifles
1532 2018-04-30 05:16:32 "Blockchain is like the Internet, and cryptocurrencies are like Internet stocks."
Although these statements make no sense when you know a little bit of technology, finance or history, if you believe them, you should google what happened to Internet stocks. Hint: way of the dodo.

1636 2018-04-30 03:35:00 I'm all for enjoying yourself as you see fit, but thank you for answering the difficult market research question "..who buys this?" But also ".......why?" Good insight as we are all reviewing beverage stocks
1637 2018-04-30 03:34:23 I don’t agree with 95% of the TA I’ve seen period until you come to the realization that cryptos are 100% a different beast they are not stocks I base my ideas off of percentages and I believe we are going higher in my opinion nothing to do with TA at All just simple math!
1638 2018-04-30 03:29:54 agree. BF ledge can simplify the edgeguard vs falco so u can secure stocks easier (very important). But BF ledge also takes away your AI (secondary issue). FD actually isn't too bad, a harder neutral, but off the hit he has very little escape.

Positive bias but 10740 becomes important. Keep leverage flexible with respect to Nifty's behaviour around 10710-740 levels.

1769 2018-04-30 01:32:16 Isn’t 10 yrs as a yardstick too long a time considering fast pace of rate change in almost all industries. Shouldn’t some flexibility in investment philosophy or proper framework be there instead. 10 yrs wld limit no of sectors & choices. I hold several stocks since past 5-6 yrs
1770 2018-04-30 01:32:03 Beginning to think about bonds, stocks and investing in your employer’s provided retirement plan are key to making smart investments.

Listen, take the money you spend on weed and go buy stock in companies connected to the Cannabis market. Those stocks are going to be the APPLE stocks now through 2040 and beyond! Do your research. I spent 2k on stocks. Flip your weed money>smoke
1775 2018-04-30 01:28:56 I don't have any defense stocks but RTN had really nice support at the 50. I would expect huge support at the 200 if it gets there.
1776 2018-04-30 01:27:30 Lebron is not supposed to just take it because he is bigger then everyone. Go back and watch film of Jordan and Kobe, lots of phantom calls. There are even YouTube videos of all the phantom calls.
1777 2018-04-30 01:27:07 The following is a work in progress. I would note I'd not endorse ANY market shorts right now, but I am looking to research/track a group of stocks who whilst currently profitable, will be vulnerable when an eventual cyclical research occurs (whenever that might be).

1781 2018-04-30 01:17:41 I think stocks might be the move this year. If you got a lil bit of change, it's time to invest, in best, invest.

1784 2018-04-30 01:14:31 Bump stocks we could agree on. Ar15s are just a semiautomatic rifle that is modular. It's a super common rifle, but there is nothing specific about it to make it "a weapon of mass murder" any more than a pistol.

And the 2a is partially for states to be able to resist a tryant.

1788 2018-04-30 01:09:46 Who wants to have the most money inside of a retirement home? Everyone and their dads invest in mutual funds and its the long play 40+ year game. You're betting on the hope that the stocks do good.

The same thing spouted over and over again by financial gurus.

1793 2018-04-30 01:05:34 With the warfare state still firmly ensconced in DC, defense stocks will regain their footing soon enough. I'm just looking for signs of bearish exhaustion to add onto my underweight positions.
1794 2018-04-30 01:05:24 Congratulations. I’ve been in the pot space since November 2015 the day after the Liberals won the election. I’m floating just fine. Stocks are only a small portion of my investments. It’s my gambling money.

1800 2018-04-30 00:59:47 You wouldn't need to even invest in one of Trump's businesses. You could make a lot of money simply shorting/buying various stocks whenever Trump lashes out against/praises a particular industry or company, if you knew his opinions beforehand. I'm convinced someone is doing this.
1801 2018-04-30 00:56:54 I really wanna start learning about stocks and shit.
1802 2018-04-30 00:54:33 How many mass murders have been committed with knives, shovels, baseball bats, etc. ? NOBODY needs to own AR-15 type weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines.
1803 2018-04-30 00:51:57 It’s sad how hood niggas will spend hundreds on weed, rims, paint job, and some Jordans and the newest IPhone but can’t purchase a nice house out the hood and invest in stocks/shares from Apple or Walmart.

1806 2018-04-30 00:49:27 I don't usually play on stocks, but I regret so much not buying petr4 when it was down, I was so sure it wouldn't broke, now it worth 5 times what it was back then, freaking advisors
1807 2018-04-30 00:48:13 I don't understand how some people can just bash stocks with the possibility of creating financial ruin for other's.  Have some honor and integrity for God's sake.
1808 2018-04-30 00:47:54 I suspect it's because they make more money from management fees when you buy into unit trusts. So they're trained to discourage you as much as possible from ordering specific stocks...for your own protection of course 
1809 2018-04-30 00:45:48 またあの人主演決まってしまうんか...？
1810 2018-04-30 00:42:18 Yup. The right way to achieve exposure to stocks and bonds is through index funds. A 0.25% management expense ratio is very high for an index fund. Actively managed funds might have MER of 1%+ which turns your 4% rule into a 3% rule.
1811 2018-04-30 00:41:17 Invest in stocks
1812 2018-04-30 00:38:23 Way to take that out of context.  Who are you even quoting?
You really have no idea how stocks/tokens work do you?

Which is doing better:
ABC coin @ $5,000 per coin
Or
XYZ coin @ 1$ per coin?
If you say anything other than "no enough info"... you need to get an education.

1814 2018-04-30 00:34:02 So ... i put down the pre-orders for "Dragon's Crown Pro" & "Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection".  pre-ordered them only because Gamestop purposefully orders low stocks of certain games or either pretends they don't have any in stock if you don't pre-order.

1821 2018-04-30 00:28:57 Add some cc and stocks, I give it 7.5 and W
1822 2018-04-30 00:28:51 Hi mate, sorry for late reply. I think both stocks you mentioned are going to do well. Smart investors in both. MRM might need a catalyst and SEA needs to get through the overhang. HZN was just my pick. Of course, all relies on oil price!
1823 2018-04-30 00:27:10 Be careful regarding what definition of “savings” is used. Nearly all papers quoting “savings” rates fail to factor stocks, bonds, or personally owned companies that have grown through time. They only look at cash accounts.
1824 2018-04-30 00:27:08 Tune out the naysayers and hold stocks with the intent to never sell.

1832 2018-04-30 00:18:21 New?
1833 2018-04-30 00:16:44 Agreed. But these people are doing what’s been shown time and time again to be betting/gambling and the basis for what they’re doing isn’t trading shares/stocks, it’s a pyramid scheme disguised as trading. There was an article recently that breaks it down properly.
1834 2018-04-30 00:15:52 The economy was shit while Obama was in office. Check your facts! The stocks hit all time highs when Trump took office.

1837 2018-04-30 00:09:20 That's inaccurate. Anyone can open a brokerage account for punting on stocks, with very little money (for as long as not day trading in the US). The main difference is opening a brokerage account is slightly more complicated (requires more personal information ... for now).
1838 2018-04-30 00:08:49 Accepted all my grants and now my stocks are crazy stacked lmao too bad I have no idea how the stock market works 
1839 2018-04-30 00:04:44 According to the Investment Company Institute, investors yanked the most money out of U.S. stocks in February since the 2008 financial crisis. BIG MISTAKE. Earnings strong-economy strong; stay the course!
1840 2018-04-30 00:04:09 Well, if we do go to war look for small cap defense stocks with earnings momentum to get lo ng.

1843 2018-04-30 00:03:09 I wouldn't personally get involved with penny stocks, but do consider a general market forecast to at least complement your trading. We use  an #AI-based model and post free nearly everyday. We predicted last week's  bearish Tuesday - the  night before.
1844 2018-04-30 00:02:32 Why do the FX versions of American stocks track so closely even though they are separated by hours apart? The algos?
1845 2018-04-30 00:00:54 e.g. you wrote recently about how accounting treats R&D vs capex, which can make book value useless for comparing different stocks. and measuring value by P/B probably skews a value portfolio toward financial cos, which have unique blowup risk
1846 2018-04-30 00:00:45 Going into next week, I feel I have s few really good stocks. $Ifxy, $Dirv. $kosk , $Tggi and $Andi. Could be a record breaker for me.

1849 2018-04-30 00:00:14 a couple counterpoints:
--the Russell 1000 value index has 715 stocks, so it's hard for it to outperform the main index by much
--"value" in this case is determined by price/book, which is less reliable than earnings, fcf, and sales for predicting future returns
1850 2018-04-30 00:00:13 @leah_levell no government branch will invest in black communities.. there no return on the investment. There’s return on prison stocks and private companies... it’s up to the community to invest in themselves
