51 2018-06-25 23:54:09 Dating advice to Aya:
Two may appear the same, but only one is meant for you. Never forget to have a Boppin time with your special one, and ensure that the fries you order always has a zappidy taste. Aromatic oil serves as a great proposal gift, or else just let her stare at you.
52 2018-06-25 23:53:56 Currently cooking dinner and oil splashed everywhere and burned my arm. Tacos would never hurt me like this.
53 2018-06-25 23:53:54 Just gave my car a full tank of gas, oil, and he’s about to get hand washed and detailed (not by me obvi lol)

56 2018-06-25 23:53:10 They already sell CBD oil without THC in smoke shops. I recommend it to anyone. There's no feeling high, just relaxed.
57 2018-06-25 23:53:07 Their stated goal on numerous occasions is to kill the oil industry.  This is all part of their hair brained scheme.
58 2018-06-25 23:52:47 You can't disagree on a fact. It's a fact that Anas Alhajji was trying to undermine US oil production back when it was in the 9 million bpd zone. He did his best to make everyone think it wasn't going to rise. We are at 11 million bpd now. That is a fact. The EIA is legit.
59 2018-06-25 23:52:38 Nowhere to run. Surrounded by redneck racists and oil fields. I grew up there. I am honestly already wondering how many rattlesnake bites they will have. Of course it’s over 100 so they won’t be outside much.
60 2018-06-25 23:52:26 Remember when the EPA (with guns drawn) shut down Gibson Guitar?
61 2018-06-25 23:52:08 It’s going to be 90 degrees Friday. Know what that means!! I’ll be putting a little coconut oil mixed with baby oil in my Heaux Kit, caressing it all over and going to sit at the rooftop terrace at work and tan!
62 2018-06-25 23:52:05 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

while we sanction Iran

They took foreign which is illegal as Hell! We know their dirty & Koch's & other oil industry is dirty! Putin is too 500bil Exxon!
72 2018-06-25 23:50:34 Not to be too much of an enabler but I think I have a spare deep fryer if you want it. It's not fancy, the "basket in oil" kind, but it works great.
73 2018-06-25 23:50:30 Some sunflower oil and jojoba oil cause I have pimples 
74 2018-06-25 23:50:21 I heard so much narrative peddling back when it was 9 million bpd. Now I'm hearing this new BS. US oil production is here. The EIA numbers are CORRECT, and it's the most reliable source for oil data in the world.
75 2018-06-25 23:49:21 As long as it’s an engine code. But if it’s a canbus code, nope. Vgate Creator V6.2 C310+ $65. Will read all Beamer codes and google has all the answers. Every time I get an oil change on my Merc they try to get me. I’m like the only reason I’m here is to not get oily.

84 2018-06-25 23:48:32 I have an Air Fryer in a Breville Smart Oven Air, that Super-Convection Bakes without deep frying, so it's CRISPY on the outside without the oil! I voted Baked, but its texture is like fried!

Do we unite when Alberta can't sell their own oil to Eastern Canada? Do we unite when infrastructure projects can't cross provincial borders?

103 2018-06-25 23:46:55 6 months or 8 or 9. Bottom line is US oil production is at 11 million bpd now (and this is a FACT), and it's on the way to 12 million bpd for the future no matter what Anas Alhajji tries to put out there #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F

107 2018-06-25 23:46:39 More natural bedfellows would be Russia and the EU because of culture, geography and balance of power. The EU need oil and peace, Russia needs a market and no western threats. With China & Russia who would be top dog - they are both too similar & too different.

109 2018-06-25 23:46:06 it's the oil from cannabis! it doesn't have the THC that marijuana does, so it doesn't make you high. it's sort of like a calming kind of thing. idk the fancy science behind it lol

119 2018-06-25 23:44:30 We are at 11 million bpd for US oil production. Anas Alhajji made it seem like that wasn't going to happen back when it was in the 9 million bpd zone. What's your response to that?

#AI will take all the jobs
And, of course, saying AI itself.“

134 2018-06-25 23:43:04 Brilliant? Anas Alhajji last year did everything he could to make people think that US oil production wasn't real. This was when it was in the 9 million bpd zone. We are now at 11 million bpd, and could get to 12 in the winter. HE WAS WRONG and he is now trying to make excuses.

142 2018-06-25 23:42:05 Hey, Guys, pretty sure its not about getting dogs high. Dogs respond favorably to CBD (non-psychoactive cousin of THC) just like humans.
"Doggy Dabs" is a brand of CBD oil I've seen before.

144 2018-06-25 23:41:55 The #MAGA crowd are his marks, and #DonTheCon is selling them a load of shit disguised to look like gold. Git yer snake oil here! Git yer snake oil here! Guaranteed to cure what ails ya! (Because you'll be dead from no insurance, no healthcare, no Social Security, no money)

147 2018-06-25 23:41:28 The country already bought the snake oil and the salesman (aka the snake ).
148 2018-06-25 23:41:05 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

152 2018-06-25 23:40:33 i know everyone who’s scared of alicia keys skincare routine is scaly bc they’ve obviously never heard of an oil cleanse
153 2018-06-25 23:40:25 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
154 2018-06-25 23:40:15 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

157 2018-06-25 23:39:45 4 days without a vehicle is over. The Jeep is fixed.

Oil sending unit, if you are curious.

New battery too since the old one spewed itself to death.
158 2018-06-25 23:39:37 This one anyway uses Olive Oil. We’d probaby roast in gingelly oil or coconut oil if one were being “authentic” and ditch the bell peppers, no?
159 2018-06-25 23:39:29 Oh and also as regards protection of wildlife, you do know don't you, that the EU via Deutsche Bank are buying rainforest to turn into palm oil groves contributing directly to deforestation and the deaths and critical endangerment of orangutans and other species
160 2018-06-25 23:39:28 Hey at least she was honest about it and stuck to her guns.
161 2018-06-25 23:39:26 A new morning routine: a cup of local green tea + a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
162 2018-06-25 23:39:18 I just went into an olive oil store and they had tester cups but no crackers or bread to put it on, like what, am I just supposed to do a shot of olive oil

164 2018-06-25 23:38:40 I personally think that #Haftar #LAN decision today on the Oil terminals is a bad one  but , if he have enough support from International Community and some Ally countries like "France" maybe something will change in the political situation in Libya.
165 2018-06-25 23:38:19 Also invented potato chips, the multiplex telegraph, the shoe lasting machine, the automatic oil cup, the carbon filament lightbulb, blood banks, the protective mailbox, the gas mask. Also its a traffic light not a street light, my bad.
166 2018-06-25 23:38:14 And then, in the height of my AX con crunch, I burned three of my fingers on my dominant hand with oil trying to cook :^) 
GG.
167 2018-06-25 23:37:57 hahahahaha bueno realmente sirve es para hacer weed oil, pero dije hash por decir alguna marijuana mas fuerte que las marijuanas normales xD hahahahahaha
168 2018-06-25 23:37:46 @RepRobBishop screw you. i'd like to know what shares you've got in energy or oil companies.  how dare you rape the environment for financial benefit. you & @GOP are complicit in atrocities against humanity, the environment & aiding a traitor in the Oval Office.  cc: @POTUS
169 2018-06-25 23:37:41 Bless the man who do my oil change tomorrow cause I’m deff not tryn hear anything about the diagnostic part . Just gimmie my shit so i can go
170 2018-06-25 23:37:36 It’s a very dangerous ploy considering the political implications in Libya-east - west divide could certainly deepen , if successful and could set off another set of conflicts. As for any country taking the oil - this would contravene present UNSC Resolutions & US sanctions.
171 2018-06-25 23:37:08 Esa es nueva, dueños de los medios de producción quieren ser ahora....o sea tener petroleras, estancias, la imprenta de billetes y hoteles, pero si ya lo hicieron.... Cristóbal López con Oil, Báez comprando media Patagonia, Boudou con Ciccone y Cristina con los Sauces y Hotesur.

173 2018-06-25 23:37:03 Be good if a bunch of people visit that red hen, and then each accidently spill a can of motor oil inside.
174 2018-06-25 23:37:01 1-#Oil pricing
To my way of thinking I believed  that is a very important topic to write today about it and all information needed will be covered in this essay.
Many people around this world  claiming that is saying about the oil pricing it is  working by rules economics...
175 2018-06-25 23:36:59 Baby oil
176 2018-06-25 23:36:52 Ladies waxing can be painful and can also lead to bumps if you have sensitive skin lol really doesn't matter  just make sure you're smooth i.e. exfoliate, coconut oil or aloe vera
177 2018-06-25 23:36:33 They did not talk about the train derailment oil spill because "they" always said rail was safer and already in place when stopping (protesting) the Keystone Pipeline. 
West Texas Oil Fields
178 2018-06-25 23:36:27 Clean compared to maybe oil and coal. LOL! The rest of the statement is true.
179 2018-06-25 23:36:26 Hey try olive oil or baby oil!
180 2018-06-25 23:36:19 I smell like the perfect blend of Diesel Fuel, Chain Bar Oil and WD40.
181 2018-06-25 23:36:12 @cynleann Hope to come ahead of our lives in America.We will be able to become a free Americanin the land they call the land of the free...when every homes . in America is not dependent on coal .oil. Natural Gas. for our power for our homes. or our automobiles. Solar power blinds
182 2018-06-25 23:36:10 Coconut oil! It’s actual a lifesaver I’ve went from natural black hair to fully blonde n I’d be bald if it wasn’t for that stuff
183 2018-06-25 23:35:27 Wonder how many American funded Iranians, paid to cause the revolt, are among the crowd, encouraging, stirring it up. You poor fools-you will follow Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Ukraine into a US puppet Govt who will drain your country of oil and resources and end up an ISIS shell. I pray
184 2018-06-25 23:35:27 Can’t wait to coconut oil my hairrrrrr
185 2018-06-25 23:35:17 By the way is it possible to not call Haftar a liberator? I’m sure Jadran could also (probably did) say that he was liberating the oil crescent from Haftar
186 2018-06-25 23:35:04 헉 그렇군뇨ㅛ....감사해요 샘!!
187 2018-06-25 23:35:02 Oil
188 2018-06-25 23:34:54 a) Quebec is not importing oil from Saudi Arabia. Someone may be buying  oil from SA and selling it to Quebecers. The province is not involved. 
b) tanker ban in the St Lawrence is fine with me. The north Pacific coast is more sensitive and pristine, the St Lawrence more battered
189 2018-06-25 23:34:50 So does garlic and like lemon eucalyptus oil
190 2018-06-25 23:34:45 Eyyah just rub palm oil nw
191 2018-06-25 23:34:40 He hates OIL & he hates the WEST more.
192 2018-06-25 23:34:38 I've been challenged to add 50 people to my free CBD oil business by Sunday. Everyone who wants a FREE business Here is the link to sign up http://Ninasbiz.myctfocbd. com
193 2018-06-25 23:34:26 Wtf they gonna do? Send a bunch of retired astronauts that work on oil rigs now to try and blow it up?
194 2018-06-25 23:34:25 You are lying. Anas Alhajji was promoting the idea last year that US oil production was not going to rise. He kept pushing the idea that the EIA numbers were not reliable. This was when it was in the 9million bpd zone. We are now at 11 million bpd. He was WRONG #OOTT #WTI #Oil
195 2018-06-25 23:34:23 Oil change and my speaker is now connected  now I just need to get my windows tinted.
196 2018-06-25 23:34:13 If u have any lavender in your house or any essential oil lavender just dilute it and spray it on urself. Mosquitos hate the smell
197 2018-06-25 23:34:13 Lol Its a mess because it’s always oil or frosting and sprinkles it’s boring but magically everyone loves it
198 2018-06-25 23:34:12 Actually higher oil prices/gas bodes better for the global economy. The division has been caused by MSM. The Dow is due for a correction. Trump is winning and you cant handle it.
199 2018-06-25 23:34:11 They estimate that 40,000 kids are used to mine for cobalt for items like electric cars, etc. I wonder how many children are used to in Alberta for the oil industry
200 2018-06-25 23:34:10 Oil 
Mo!!
201 2018-06-25 23:34:03 Things i wanna do: hang out with Jacob

202 2018-06-25 23:34:02 #GodzWeedz #StonerFam

I believe Medical Marijuana will be the first legalization. IMO each and every Cancer Patient should Have Legal Access to #CBD and Cannabis Oil, Tinctures, no matter where they live inside the United States. Not Allowing Them Access is Unjust and Immoral.
203 2018-06-25 23:34:02 The power it can have on other trust nothing especially in business safety first and with a customer who is a world leader saftey is how buisness is done an osha instructor in high school so I get it spent more time on my back working than most on feet in tanks oil gas chemical
204 2018-06-25 23:33:59 Ppl tht dn’t need glasses r lucky as hell y’all dn’t gotta worry about cleaning yr glasses all the time cuz the oil causes acne, or not laying down with them on cuz they can break, or having to replace them and a bunch of other shit 
205 2018-06-25 23:33:50 But, unless we add Geothermal and nuke based electricity, then we will simply replace oil with coal. Even now, China is foisting coal on many other nations. Basically, stable baseload is needed.
206 2018-06-25 23:33:46 Black seed oil will save our lives, look it up!!!! Now
207 2018-06-25 23:33:39 You can also pour the lime juice marinade juices into a sauce pan with some oil, Worcestershire, Tabasco, garlic powder, and a little mustard, then cook it down to make a sauce while the steak cooks.
208 2018-06-25 23:33:30 so i hear my brother yelling my name like really urgently so i freaking run to the kitchen only to see his dumbass flinching away from the popping oil in the pan and yelling at me to flip his stupid egg
209 2018-06-25 23:33:27 Did you eat something funky?  I know you rolled in motor oil recently.  I hope you feel better soon
210 2018-06-25 23:32:57 US at 12 mm in 6 months?  Curious to know how the oil is getting to market.  Pioneer just called the Permian as flat-ish for 12 months starting in Q4 with lots of drilling, but a big slow-down in completions.  Going to cast aspersions on them too?
211 2018-06-25 23:32:51 I got mine done and got refills for like 3 months and mine were ok! Just put castor oil every night like a week before you get them!
212 2018-06-25 23:32:44 I used an electric water boiler nearly every day! Also an essential oil defuser!
213 2018-06-25 23:32:34 fav oil cleansers that DO NOT have minerals in them? go...
214 2018-06-25 23:32:10 Put black seed oil in your hair care regimen, helps with itchy scalp and will help grow hair
215 2018-06-25 23:32:01 Oil changes every 5K miles. New Car.
216 2018-06-25 23:31:51 I was feeling super tired this afternoon, couldn't get past this brain fog. 

Fried up a steak in coconut oil for lunch and viola, I'm feeling good again. 

My brain loves all that protein and so do I.

221 2018-06-25 23:30:47 wwwwwwwww
222 2018-06-25 23:30:44 Actually, they don't want that. I follow stuff in the US and the last thing they plan is a foreign military invasion. It doesn't matter that we're oil rich, Maduro broke PDVSA. Also, Maduro is already illegitimate, the Parliament and [Legit] Supreme Court established it already.
223 2018-06-25 23:30:29 How can you sell his snake oil ? Didn't your parents raise you better.

225 2018-06-25 23:30:04 Big Oil has deployed both Trolls and Bots to help Rick Scott since he's on board for drilling our coastlines. Bill Nelson filed legislation to try to block it. Expect to see them on everything he posts. Flag them when you see them.
226 2018-06-25 23:30:03 Vitamin c 1000mgs and mineral oil
227 2018-06-25 23:30:01 What & who will benefit?
Another “occupation for the resources”
What Libya needs is self-empowerment with own people determining its future in peace, building democratic institutions by its own constitution!
Not Western grab for oil/gas reserves for Western companies benefits!
228 2018-06-25 23:29:49 But what about the UK? @FrankBakerFCO cameo appearance in the battle for oil, calling only one side as a terrorist group led by a terrorist, was of great impact
229 2018-06-25 23:29:36 theres no oil there
230 2018-06-25 23:28:57 I moisturised before bed and now I feel like a seagull stuck in an oil spill with the heat.
231 2018-06-25 23:28:43 Low key might join the Space Force

Pros:
-No bugs on the moon
-Alien pussy probably goes fucking dumb
-Nothin but big gas (I highly doubt an advanced alien civilization would smoke anything less than mid)

Cons: 
-Probably gonna make us invade Space Iraq for oil :(
232 2018-06-25 23:28:28 Yeah but I am not calling your system broken, evil etc. This is a US issue.  Get angry about real stuff China ripping off the west, the EU ass fucking the UK on the exit. The EU ducking Russian cock for oil. What about Italy getting some balls and handing off the burden to others
233 2018-06-25 23:28:09 One would swear you have that pipeline built &ready to pump oil. Perhaps save that gloating til’ it is built. Ucould also vote on CTax & let the people decide how much they want to pay. Not just vague polls that say people want action. Let them decide how much action. Show math2.
234 2018-06-25 23:28:07 it’s so funny to put oil on ur skin on a hot day and then feel yourself boil like a chicken
235 2018-06-25 23:28:04 Nice, tate changes everything!

For tooth trouble, I reach for the clove oil and whiskey!
236 2018-06-25 23:27:54 i follow the doc and he is spot on with his predictions and forecasts.
you on the other hand push some kind of hardcore #FakeNews on oil prices.  I told you last yr not to bet against Saudi Arabia and you shrugged it off, well.. look who is crying now.  YOU.
237 2018-06-25 23:27:52 What about tanning oil? 
238 2018-06-25 23:27:31 Babies in cages....pics from Obama admin.
I'm not rich and got a tax cut. 
We import oil...not good.
I pack a side arm at all times and own multiple rifles. I'm also well trained in their use. I'm a Marine.
You do not want to start shit, beta.  Step it back.
239 2018-06-25 23:27:16 If you’re going to go that route get the Lexus. A4’s have oil problems that lead to complete motor overhauls at high mileage aka like 6k in repairs.
240 2018-06-25 23:27:14 Just don't touch the hot sauce. Err, sauces. These are sacrosanct. Sriracha, sambal oelek, chili oil, Frank's, Tabasco, Louisiana hot sauce, habanero, scotch bonnet, etc.

244 2018-06-25 23:26:48 Nice!
With a  German and an Italian car in the foreground, both of which were probably built in the States.
"Morons Are Getting (it) Assbackwards".
Now Harley Davidson is gonna build bikes in Europe. 
Maybe THEY won't leak oil so bad!

245 2018-06-25 23:26:15 Looking for CBD oil from marijuana, not hemp but without thc?
246 2018-06-25 23:26:06 や、次を待て
247 2018-06-25 23:26:02 A new Greenpeace International investigation has revealed that Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader, is still linked to forest destruction for palm oil almost five years after committing to end deforestation.
248 2018-06-25 23:25:59 Hindi naman ako nainform na upgraded na pala ang chili oil sa Sinangag Express sa Pacita naubo ako sa anghang eh naka inom pa ako muntik pang lumabas ang hindi dapat buti naagapan. #jgh

250 2018-06-25 23:25:41 Haven't noticed, those tax cuts weren't just for the rich. We've enjoyed increased prosperity tyvm. Why should we be constantly held hostage to other nations for oil? After billions of $ little o gave out, they couldn't get alt. to work. There were never babies in cages.
251 2018-06-25 23:25:33 Wow. Anas Alhajji, you're more of a coward than I thought you were. You hide behind a fake account. We are at 11 million bpd for US oil production. Enjoy 12 when it happens. The EIA is right no matter what BS you say. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
252 2018-06-25 23:25:27 You know you’re blessed when, while you’re gone to Summer camp #1, your wife gets your oil changed and cleans your car. Overwhelming view of the Gospel. Love that we get to do ministry together.
253 2018-06-25 23:25:10 Question who's paying for the 3 rd new Runway oh wait the largest Oil find ever and who's paying for Brexit exit bill oh wait the largest Oil find ever who's paying for big Ben oh wait ..And Reese Moggs wee hoose ... Great British Empire Bleeding us dry for 300 yrs +
254 2018-06-25 23:24:02 Also, did u work hard to create the oil that just happens to be in the province in which u live?
255 2018-06-25 23:23:23 Exactly. Now the old pipeline will be shut down by politics for “testing, repairs, etc., etc. “ rendering that line beyond useless. Why doesn’t anyone else see this. Why would Alberta or the country let the Liberals control access to oil markets. We all should be up in arms.
256 2018-06-25 23:23:18 Weren't parents arrested and their epileptic son taken away for giving him CBD marijuana oil? (This is the kind that does NOT make you high—strickly medicinal)
257 2018-06-25 23:22:53 but with a lot of countries supporting Haftar he may try to ship oil independently and some countries may be willing to send the ships.
258 2018-06-25 23:22:47 the options aren't #sitec or oil.  They're #sitec or solar, or biomass, or wind, or other alternatives.  It doesn't do the planet any favours to "make a lake" to liquify natural gas to be shipped and burned somewhere else.  Electricity demand has been flat in BC (& NA) for years.
259 2018-06-25 23:22:41 Well I can say one thing, if you smoke a lot of cigarettes per day, you should quit smoking and when you do, your allergies and reactions to orange oil, are going to disappear. You won't need 2 puffers. Not saying how I discovered this.
260 2018-06-25 23:22:25 Oh there will ever beer! It’ll be like There Will Be Blood but it’ll be beer instead of oil and beer instead of blood!

What I’m really saying is beer, there will be some! 
261 2018-06-25 23:22:20  please go with annointing oil and faith. You so funny
262 2018-06-25 23:21:22 Should probably go to sleep, but instead I’m laying in the dark listening to ‘Oil Of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides’ yet again

272 2018-06-25 23:19:22 U sold US snake oil, 45. Do the math. 2 many promises unkept multiplied by criminal, traitorous behavior, equals some really pissed off Americans. At your next rally, have someone count the crowd. Your fervent, unwavering supporters R a much smaller number than the rest of us.
273 2018-06-25 23:19:22 oh!イル
274 2018-06-25 23:19:19 I would assume because oil theoretically doesn’t contain protein, but unless it’s pure, there’s no way to say.
275 2018-06-25 23:19:19 my give AF bar is as deep as a west Texas oil well
276 2018-06-25 23:18:57 "Oil" is probably a good one
277 2018-06-25 23:18:47 Thought I smelled used car snake oil. @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN don't slip on the oil.
278 2018-06-25 23:18:34 just dripped water into hot oil to see if it was hot enough to fry plantains so what im trying to say is i am sorry for besmirching anthony bourdain’s legacy
279 2018-06-25 23:18:34 I’m currently having a love affair with toasted sesame oil. It just smells so nice and gives your food such a bomb flavor.

Blood quantum laws requiring natives to prove their ancestry to the federal government date back to the 1700's.

290 2018-06-25 23:17:11 well unless youre talking about the us military, who lay their lives for the oil industry and kill innocents. In that case, yeah, bunch of cowards.
291 2018-06-25 23:16:53 Straight? Don’t oils have to be mixed with coconut oil?

293 2018-06-25 23:16:31 You drill where the oil is, duh
294 2018-06-25 23:16:22 That’s one way to move jobs away from oil production. 
295 2018-06-25 23:16:21 I need a good ass camera, a tripod and some baby oil.
296 2018-06-25 23:16:15 Yes sir

299 2018-06-25 23:16:02 Read (or scan) EIA data you narrative pushing bot. We are at 11 million bpd for US oil production, and we'll likely be at 12 in 6 months. No amount of Anas Alhajji style fraud can change that truth #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #DXY

303 2018-06-25 23:15:44 don't have an exact recipe, but using coconut oil instead of butter to make "cannabutter" is just as good (better imo) and easy to make. From there, you could just use any other vegan brownie recipe! Just make sure you decarbolize the weed first :) DM me if you have any questions
304 2018-06-25 23:15:09 I FEEL YOU my curl pattern is all over the place and inconsistent so my hair will probably always be kind of frizzy. But some wicked bargain stuff that has really worked for me is vo5 shampoo and conditioner (weird but true) and ors olive oil products !!
305 2018-06-25 23:14:53 I generally look to limit government intervention and capital punishment, but anyone calling something “mayo” that is not emulsified egg, oil, mustard and vinegar should be punished by the firing squad.

308 2018-06-25 23:14:43 I was over at my son's friends house and she told me she felt faint and not good, and then rubbed a bunch of peppermint oil on her forehead. She also rubs "essential oils" on her son who now smells really weird. She's also starting her MLM Essential Oils "business" #notabuyer

312 2018-06-25 23:14:10 But an imbalance in exported manufactured goods doesn't even mean much when you realize that the US is generally a bigger market than any foreign country, so you expect more of US manufacturing to be sold here than abroad. Also, oil is in $, so currency risks of trade def are min

315 2018-06-25 23:13:49 Imagine if the US federal gov took Texas’s oil revenue without Texans benefiting ....what would happen
316 2018-06-25 23:13:44 You practiced "civility" and can't win the argument.   "They cut taxes for the rich........." who pay almost ALL of anyone's taxes with some 20-45% of people not paying at all.  Those oil companies are better suited to "public land" that never served the public.
317 2018-06-25 23:13:36 We will never have energy independence. We have vastly improved our overall oil and gas security with fracking and other tech and infrastructure changes. Improved energy security? YES. Energy independence? NO. But Texas is a big part of our energy security improvements!

326 2018-06-25 23:12:52 do you ever just wanna bathe in coconut oil bc same
327 2018-06-25 23:12:52 That's one of the worst parts of oil work, the long drive after hours/days on site. I don't miss that. Stay safe.
328 2018-06-25 23:12:47 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
329 2018-06-25 23:12:36 I’ve been using this shave oil from bath and body works and it’s amazing. That paired with their in-shower lotion has helped me sooo much!
330 2018-06-25 23:12:36 hidratante eu gosto do neutrogena e do clean&clear (esse último é a metade do preço e eu até prefiro). já o protetor solar, o que resolveu mesmo pra mim foi o minesol oil control da roc. é caro, mas dá pra comprar parcelado e ir usando pouquinho, dura bastante

336 2018-06-25 23:11:29 False. We're completely self reliant. We have plenty of oil, lumber, mineral resources, crops, labor, manufacturing capabilities. If the entire world was destroyed aside from the US we'd still be fine.

339 2018-06-25 23:11:14 It’s all one big club. It’s like WWF Wrestling. They hit each other with fake chairs right after helping each other oil up their backs & make plans for after the “fight.”
340 2018-06-25 23:11:11 It is the latter the west-based NOC.  Oil shipping companies have all so far recognized this as so as well as UN resolutions etc. There was supposed to be a merger I recall but it was never finalized.

343 2018-06-25 23:10:54 It's a joke in public markets. You can screen negatively for traits you don't like (oil) or stuff you do like (lots of women on boards), but there's a tenuous connection between the act of investing and pressure to do good things, mediated by return on capital and secondary xchng

355 2018-06-25 23:09:34 @LBC @iancollinsuk Ian, about vaping and going back to tobacco, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Vaping is vastly superior; vapers never go back.  Same with oil versus flower; 420 oil users never go back to flower.

I.e., the obsession of an 8-year Alinskyite ideologue. When #CalamityOrganizer felt Shrillary was assured of victory, he imprudently walked into the #SpyGate/#FBI-for-Shrillary scandal and the 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩.

416 2018-06-25 22:59:53 thank you!! and i'm sure her liver will hold up with a nice coating of olive oil
417 2018-06-25 22:59:50 I also tip the guys who change my oil and rotate my tires. Those guys work hard too. And in most cases in very hot weather. And it seems like everyone forgets about tipping them!
418 2018-06-25 22:59:44 Harley Davidson? One company in the world’s biggest economy. Unemployment rates are at lowest rates in decades. Stock markets at record highs. Economic growth is good. Oil and gas prices and production are strong. 
Exactly what defines a strong economy for you?
419 2018-06-25 22:59:41 oil painting is so therapeutic but also so frustrating for me 
420 2018-06-25 22:59:40 If you check Matt’s activism page he’s fought oil companies, banks, billionaires, US EPA, and even beat Brockovich in court, in Ohio. Your network is puny, laughable, and can’t touch us.

422 2018-06-25 22:59:16 What do you know about Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion in the Oil & Gas Industry? Tomorrow we learn from experts in the field at the geno-MIC conference with some keynote presentations and workshops. Details on our website.
423 2018-06-25 22:59:15 No argment there doc! 

I think politicians of all colours are terrified to come down on these snake oil salesmen. Ironic really because the original snake oil was pilloried and did have (some) positive effects due to the presence of compounds that dilated the suface capiliaries.
424 2018-06-25 22:59:13 the European tour and let the Santa Barbara oil drilling was happening with everyone dressed how wonderfully
425 2018-06-25 22:59:05 It’s honestly the easiest recipe ever. Marinate the tenderloin with salt, pepper, paprika, and olive oil. For the sauce it’s just mayo and sriracha. Buns I like using the Hawaiian ones forget the name off the top my head.

432 2018-06-25 22:58:10 Baby oil mixed with conditioner is like black magic for when it gets real bad. I think I have more hair on my brush than I do on my head haha. Yass we can do this b

435 2018-06-25 22:57:37 Sale of Libyan oil is protected by UN Security Council resolution 2362. Doubt Russia or the UAE will go against international law..
436 2018-06-25 22:57:34 But what about the ones that aren't in canisters? You'd have to build something to keep the oil from spewing out of the open hole.
437 2018-06-25 22:57:30 @LucidInvestment I think a S&P 500/Gold/Oil update would be nice

451 2018-06-25 22:56:12 I always tip at least 20%. I don’t change the oil. My husband does. He baby’s his Mercedes so I am sure he does as needed. He is a car fanatic! ‘68 Porsche 912, another 911, ‘35 Chevy pick up, ‘28 Ford model A, 2 British Mini Coopers! My car never sees inside of garages!

552 2018-06-25 22:43:07 This island wide eh? BEC low on fuel oil again smh
553 2018-06-25 22:43:05 By the way @ericnuttalls, you're a fake account. A bot most likely. This is typical Anas Alhajji. He is a fraud, and he gets his orders from Ridayh (or who ever is paying him to spread word salad narrarive). Again, he has been wrong in everything #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent
554 2018-06-25 22:42:50 yeah
i oil painted it
555 2018-06-25 22:42:33 What? Says who? 

China is starting to sell oil futures in yuan and the AIIB bank kicked off a couple years ago. These are threats, but they where in the works long before Trump. 

You dont know what you're talking about.
556 2018-06-25 22:42:14 I see nothing wrong with buying oil from ISIS, everyone did it. Opposition, Kurds, Turkey, and the government. This oil was used to generate electricity for both government and rebel held areas. Without it living conditions would have been abysmal to say the least.
557 2018-06-25 22:42:10 Cristobal Lopez, Fabián De Souza y Ricardo Echegaray a juicio oral por defraudación agravada. Caso Oil Combustibles. La AFIP reclama $ 20.000 millones
558 2018-06-25 22:42:04 朝からくぎゅーーーーーー
559 2018-06-25 22:41:50 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
560 2018-06-25 22:41:50 That oil cleanser is everything!!!
561 2018-06-25 22:41:47 @megan_mcnabb thanks for the follow. I love elephants. So sorry you have endo. I had a hysterectomy before I was 30. What is the oil part mean?
562 2018-06-25 22:41:42 Yup.  Those videos of her literally calling for the harassment of officials and their familes will be great for GOP ads!
563 2018-06-25 22:41:38 That’s not an oil problem, it’s a stupid problem taking the train thru flooded fields
564 2018-06-25 22:41:26 You not get avon round your way. Skin so soft oil 
565 2018-06-25 22:41:25 Coconut oil
566 2018-06-25 22:40:51 The beds are burning, Midnight Oil
567 2018-06-25 22:40:46 Oil is near recent highs.  I am curious how much of impact it will have.
568 2018-06-25 22:40:35 Well, medicinal is on the vote for Oklahoma this time - it’s not gonna pass. 

If cbd oil was mad a national pass.
569 2018-06-25 22:40:33 Of course they did, Jordan  has plenty of oil...
570 2018-06-25 22:40:30 Um. This girl is talking about how she warms coconut oil and puts it in her eyes every day. IN her eyes. Whut
571 2018-06-25 22:40:23 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
572 2018-06-25 22:40:22 Put coconut oil on my hair since I’m bleaching it tonight and I feel like I’m playing night crawlers with frank and charlie
573 2018-06-25 22:40:19 Really?  Be specific. When did he actually get oil fundamentals right? Again, since last summer, he has been saying US oil won't increase. We are now at 11 million, and may get to 12 in 6 months. HE WAS DEAD WRONG. All he does is narrative word salad.
574 2018-06-25 22:40:15 It’s been like the Americans have found new oil fields to invade mosquito wise atm
575 2018-06-25 22:40:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
576 2018-06-25 22:39:52 This Nigeria you people with low life are trying to flame up,some using their influence and social media popularity, if it flames up,even your mother won't be spared.
May God not let calamities befall our nation for the atrocities committed by fools and promoted by the gullible.
577 2018-06-25 22:39:40 Red palm oil was forced down her throat.
578 2018-06-25 22:39:32 you are my only kidney vetch 
oblique because your clove is toe 
you're oil tycoon and cumin seed 
too single-breasted too direct
579 2018-06-25 22:39:24 Every time I get paid it seems like I have to take care of something!! I have to get an oil change 
580 2018-06-25 22:39:21 Is that oil painting on a canvas @wordsbynourz ?
581 2018-06-25 22:39:15 It is strange how this spill could have happened. The oil was in the new "safe" DOT-117 tank cars. The industry and their pawns in Congress and regulatory agencies assured us that these new tank cars would solve the problem.
582 2018-06-25 22:39:09 Until there is mo more demand for oil, Help us to understand how a pipeline is not a better answer then this. 
I would love to see a world covered in beautiful solar panels, but the demand for oil will not end tomorrow.
583 2018-06-25 22:38:55 Domenech lobbied for oil and energy companies. Prior to being named to the trump admin, he was the chair of the Koch-funded TPPF Fueling Freedom Project. Their goals include explaining “the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels” and ending the EPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide.
584 2018-06-25 22:38:49 Actually it's for other women so they can "outshine them"...sexuality is not just the body alone...it's so much more
585 2018-06-25 22:38:40 @realDonaldTrump Protests continue in Tehran and Iran, strikes continue, this movement will not stop. In the next two months, Iran's oil will be completely cut off, and all sanctions will be implemented.
586 2018-06-25 22:38:37 I love bio oil but hate how it makes you feeeeel so greasy maaaan
587 2018-06-25 22:38:23 i just made a delicious mint/garlic dip with my greek yogurt *q* it has fresh mint, full fat greek yogurt (or fat yogurt) minced garlic, chili powder, olive oil and lemon and it was delicious 
588 2018-06-25 22:38:23 on today’s special 1v1 match: reynolds’ spaghetti arms vs Phil lembo oil filter overtightening..... who will win?
589 2018-06-25 22:38:17 True
590 2018-06-25 22:38:14 Jiffy Lube just changed my oil and everything in only ten minutes I’m in shock
591 2018-06-25 22:38:06 HAHAHAHA that fish oil life 
592 2018-06-25 22:38:03 Make sure the water is filtered if you are in Flint or live near a army base or a coal mine or a oil pipeline or near a superfund area or a factory or...............
593 2018-06-25 22:38:01 “i need some more nut oil if you don’t mind” @haroldjay65 
594 2018-06-25 22:37:32 Come to @GalwayUnitedFC instead. We have that sweet sweet oil money now
595 2018-06-25 22:37:31 started putting jamaican black castor oil underneath my sew in...as if my hair needs to be any thicker
596 2018-06-25 22:37:26 I’ve always enjoyed watching her lead worship && sing. It’s like when she opens her mouth the oil just falls out 
597 2018-06-25 22:37:17 Seeing the grind marks will be my metric, now. Evoo would be a terrible oil, but would tallow be okay? I'm making some right now.
598 2018-06-25 22:37:09 Came in for oil change now these dealers trying to get me to upgrade me car. My car only 2yrs old. It’s okay still brand new

601 2018-06-25 22:36:55 Oh when oil is in it, they're right there.
602 2018-06-25 22:36:52 Hmm. I love toasted pita bread with olive oil and zaatar, if that inspires you ;)
603 2018-06-25 22:36:26 @realDonaldTrump Oil will be shown, the criminal regime in Iran should not be able to export even a barrel of oil, this is a very important issue. With the oil revenue, the Iranian regime helps the terrorist groups to massacre people in the Middle East
604 2018-06-25 22:36:22 Yay for having coworkers who work on machines all day and know how to work on cars :-) Got my oil changed for free.. :-)
605 2018-06-25 22:36:21 I don’t know, the oil change guy and his family of naturalized Citizens ended up voting for Trump because we talked about it. My motto is try to add one or two people into the convo. But I always keep it on policy as much as possible.
606 2018-06-25 22:36:19 Fab article about this skincare range supporting our #NHS  & including what it can pay for.   

 It's great for looking after skin including #lipoedema & #lymphoedema as wearing #compression can be drying. My legs love the oil in summer and the fragrance free lotion in winter.
607 2018-06-25 22:36:15 I'm not sure @chris_sutton73 has an agenda for Iran. I suspect he has been trying to inject some enthusiasm and excitement into what looked like a predictable group outcome. While imparting wisdom about Russia's geography and veg oil output.
608 2018-06-25 22:36:08 Not to brag.. but pretty sure I'm a officially a pro at quinoa bowls now. Just made my best one, quinoa, avocado, mushrooms, spinach, cilantro, onion, olive oil, salt & pepper, and a piece of Publix fried chicken (not healthy, but heaven sent) feelin proud 
609 2018-06-25 22:35:57 while I disagree with what @RepMaxineWaters said and not sure how to feel about refusing service to @PressSec (because of the slippery slope..NOT because she doesn't deserve such treatment) I certainly can't argue with what you're saying; civility &  trump is like oil  & vinegar
610 2018-06-25 22:35:53 @realDonaldTrump and Iran's oil will be cut off completely in the next two months. President Trump never to impel anyone to sanction oil. The effect of sanctions is only with full sanctions.
611 2018-06-25 22:35:50 The sativex ingredients..
Each spray (100 µL) contains 2.7 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 2.5 mg cannabidiol (CBD). Nonmedicinal ingredients: ethanol, propylene glycol, and peppermint oil.
You can Google it. Only 2 cannabinoids and nothing else from the cannabis plant
612 2018-06-25 22:35:49 Me and spelling shit right is like oil and water
613 2018-06-25 22:35:32 EI @TwitterSupport minha conta foi bloqueada a mais de um mês com a alegação de q eu sou menor de idade eu ja mandei minha documentação pra vcs milhares de vezes e até agora nada.
614 2018-06-25 22:35:29 El gas oil es una basura. En el mundo es así. El de acá mucho más.
615 2018-06-25 22:35:10 Beach vacations are nice, though.
616 2018-06-25 22:35:10 Hate getting oil changes
617 2018-06-25 22:34:59 “Knowledge and judgement” is the oil that keeps you learning how to live....
618 2018-06-25 22:34:55 Come down and see us for your much needed oil change and receive discounts on your car wash too!!
619 2018-06-25 22:34:55 It’s happy Monday! Starting the week with a major studio cleanup!  #artstudio #brigittebalbinot #fineart #art #oil #coldwax #abstractart #picoftheday #artgallery #collectors
620 2018-06-25 22:34:50 Have you seen their ratings?  They basically can't.
621 2018-06-25 22:34:49 The way the beautiful women look at me alone is enough to make a simp’s blood boil. I feel the envy again. Beach body ready for sure... strategic starvation. Eating raw coconut oil is the lowest one need go. Been doing IF for over a year, so a couple days without food is fine.
622 2018-06-25 22:34:49 Gotta take multivitamins, and not eat so crazy, and drink bookoo water cuhz. Genetics play a role too. You can use Jamaican castor oil or other natural hair products to help.
623 2018-06-25 22:34:43 Eastern Canada imports 700,000 barrels of oil “EACH” day. $60 M/day…$50 B/year. All that money could be supporting Alberta and good Canadian jobs. When will you stand up for Canada? BUILD ENERGY EAST.
624 2018-06-25 22:34:34 Managed to get hot oil on my face and in my eye .. so far for tanning this week
625 2018-06-25 22:34:06 @jimcramer Hi Jim, you mentiond a few weeks back that you felt oil was going to $60 and now you think its headed to $70.  What has changed your thinking?
626 2018-06-25 22:33:47 a living bottle of olive oil
627 2018-06-25 22:33:44 Excellent. I normally have to pay good money to see that sort of stuff. Any chance of a bit of baby oil and paddling pools next time?
628 2018-06-25 22:33:40 How does a country go from oil boom to world poverty capital? Oh I know! After going through an Abacha, Babangida,Obasanjo, Yaradua, GEJ, and finally to top it all of a Buhari that’s the end game !
629 2018-06-25 22:33:27 I mean maybe. We carved things at the chicken oil too.
630 2018-06-25 22:33:14 vicks is something I'm use to. it won't work. and rose oil will make me throw up

636 2018-06-25 22:32:36 @realDonaldTrump When are you going to FIRE SCOTT PRUITT? This man is the single most toxic cabinet member you have and is under investigation in 15 separate investigations. The latest emails show he tried to recruit stop executives in oil & gas trading groups. FIRE HIM NOW!
637 2018-06-25 22:32:26 @realDonaldTrump the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Virginia prison medical malpractice. I got out of prison to be put on insulin drip for a week. Also war on drugs in prison. Contact me
638 2018-06-25 22:32:22 Available from servos (next to the oil stand) and depots, and they did home delivery.

There was a depot across from the Sth Melb market from memory
639 2018-06-25 22:32:20 Im an oil pick up tube, serpentine belt, and clutch disk away from being done with the Miata

641 2018-06-25 22:32:02 I’ve been putting caster oil on my brows before bed to help them grow and get thicker and I must say I think it’s working
642 2018-06-25 22:32:01 Yeh
643 2018-06-25 22:32:00 I am Breaking the rules today! Going LIVE at 5PM MST with Mike Middelkoop, an oil & gas guy. Who travels & works on the big ships ! WOW...he has a story to tell!
644 2018-06-25 22:31:51 Petrobras pumps first oil from offshore Tartaruga Verde field
645 2018-06-25 22:31:51 45 and rep congress are incompetent. Hillary's emails don't matter. They couldn't build a wall. No immigration policy. Personal taxes actually go up. Oil up 50% last 12 months. Dow flat last 6 months. Wages no better. Tariffs causing loss of jobs and higher prices on everything.
646 2018-06-25 22:31:34 He isn't a oil painting too look at either
647 2018-06-25 22:31:26 Israel has been far too hard on Palestine.  Now they opportunistically invade the Golan Heights for Genie Oil, run by the likes of Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, and Jacob Rothschild.  Israel allows the Islamic State sex slavers to stay near their border and protects them
648 2018-06-25 22:31:20 You mean by selling national parks off bit by bit to oil abd gas companies? You are full of terrible ideas @realDonaldTrump
649 2018-06-25 22:31:20 CARS IS A TERRIFYING FRANCHISE WHERE THEY SHED MOLTS LIKE CRABS, DON'T HAVE ACTUAL EYES, PISS OIL, AND THE CLOUDS ARE SHAPED LIKE TIRE TRACKS
IM THE ONLY PERSON WILLING TO DOCUMENT IT
650 2018-06-25 22:31:16 I do... Once it gets long enough, you can pull it out of the way. Beard oil also helps.
651 2018-06-25 22:31:16 CBD oil is great for stress/anxiety as well.
652 2018-06-25 22:31:05 About 65 years ago I remember our servant in India telling us that the village munsif would order whole truckloads of American Aid - milk poweder and vegetable oil - to be thrown into the river, because they were "poisoned by the Americans". Satan works with evil minds everywhere
653 2018-06-25 22:31:05 bruh this oil change is passing out free water 
654 2018-06-25 22:30:55 Hey. It was you that said oil production was down under Obama. It wasn't. I am not picking and choosing. We have had this discussion before. This unnecessary trade war is going to come back and bite us.
655 2018-06-25 22:30:47 Seems like one of the Captains on the sinking ship that was Medical  Cannabis in Canada has left all us sick patients to die in the water.  without legal access to Hash, quality cannabis oils, Vape oil, Shatter,  all the SCC ruled for patient access, WHERE??
656 2018-06-25 22:30:44 There’s not enough oil in the universe. This dude smells so bad! And it’s on a plane so not like I can avoid it. Nevermind the falling over onto me and other bullshit I put up w. I’ve been on this plane too long.
657 2018-06-25 22:30:42 I need my cooking oil privileges taken away
658 2018-06-25 22:30:28 Do you have a preferred brand of oil to use?
659 2018-06-25 22:30:26 More lies more crap you want to infest are coastlines up and down the Eastern seaboard with hundred of oil rigs all stemming from lobbyists for big oil companies this is your GOP Georgia South Carolina Florida North Carolina Virginia Washington DC Jersey New York
660 2018-06-25 22:29:47 Ah, SubZero is back.  If you followed Dr. Alhajji, you wouldn't find yourself short oil since $40.  At least, if you took his advice and interpreted his excellent outlook.  Did the "elephant" go bankrupt yet?  You sound like a very very broken short.
661 2018-06-25 22:29:39 probably why oil king picked her up
662 2018-06-25 22:29:26 Made with real orphan well oil. Don't worry, the public will pay for it.
663 2018-06-25 22:29:26 I use essential oil under the nose for that!
664 2018-06-25 22:29:10 They don't care as long as he rolls back protections from big oil and gas...bottom line.
665 2018-06-25 22:29:04 I will! I read that tea tree oil can be used as a deodorant. But i have to mix it with a carrier oil (coconut). So we’ll see. I’ll apply some before the gym tonight and see how it fares.
666 2018-06-25 22:28:54 @PeanutButterCo I love your peanut butter so much! I eat it right out of the jar instead of dessert.  Could you please try to make it without palm oil?
667 2018-06-25 22:28:47 My aching back and I agree with you, Matt. (CBD oil works for me!)
668 2018-06-25 22:28:29 My mom is so clutch. She came running with the tanning oil  she’s supporting my dream 
669 2018-06-25 22:28:20 That is such a good stat. Three million gallons is a cube with 73-foot sides. Way bigger than this measly pile of bikes. Completely. Filled. With. Oil.
670 2018-06-25 22:28:14 I  this! But, do be careful @miz_cracker mentioning your oil rich skin. The tRump may want to drill you.  #miscrackerLUV 
671 2018-06-25 22:28:11 Oh! Are there any other chronic headache sufferers in the crowd?  I get them almost daily, up to and including migraines. Last night, I finally tried the ‘peppermint oil on the temples’ thing, and it actually helped. In case anyone else is looking for relief. 
672 2018-06-25 22:28:10 I'll go with Forbes. Fact is that it was cheaper to produce oil in North Dakota than in eastern Utah and western Colorado. There was such a glut on the market that prices dropped below what it cost to produce in those areas.
673 2018-06-25 22:28:07 And you support SNP who want an oil based economy? You support Nicola who traverses Scotland in a helicopter, and council leader in Glasgow swans about in a roller...green when it suits.
674 2018-06-25 22:28:05 Been a big fan since the “Ack & Oil Can” days! I know what high regard you hold Coach Mumme. Congratulations and good luck. If JSU runs the ole fullback sweep/pass on the goal line, I’ll know whose idea that was. Has Hal Mumme ever met a fullback..? 
675 2018-06-25 22:28:01 You meant to say 30 - 40% of racist people believe Trump is intelligent..because the other 60-70% who didn't vote 4 him, know the difference between an intelligent person (Obama) and a snake oil salesman (Donald Trump). My #MondayMotivation is to push back on foolishness
676 2018-06-25 22:27:56 As long as it doesn't interfere with our ongoing blood-for-oil campaign in the middle east it should be just fine. 
677 2018-06-25 22:27:51 Coal and oil are clean energy?
678 2018-06-25 22:27:44 Didn’t know about it, until my boss told me. I added a little olive oil, and some cut off fresh veggies. Soooo GOOD.
679 2018-06-25 22:27:34 Do what they do in the movies. Use Vicks under your nose. It's easier then passing out. Ooh...or a scarf with rose oil on it over your nose & mouth.
680 2018-06-25 22:27:20 Infrastructure (roads, railways and hydro power) are all of a sudden springing up within 3 yrs of @MBuhari regime. Reserves (foreign) more than double inspire  of the low oil revenues. Expect more goodies when @MBuhari make a return Sir in 2019
681 2018-06-25 22:26:27 Use coconut oil to get even more tan but only do 30 min on each side instead of an hour
682 2018-06-25 22:26:26 Then why you keep making wars based on oil and petroleum!?
683 2018-06-25 22:26:22 Right! Same with my dad. Theres a hint if motor oil in my blood, my thirst for amazing cars and smell of gasoline keeps me alive. My dad is my biggest influence when it comes to being a gear head, I took interests in subaru, and my brother is currently an autobody mechanic.

687 2018-06-25 22:26:08 I guess with all that oil flowing into the river in Iowa, you had to switch to gas.

690 2018-06-25 22:25:24 I shoulda took my ass to Walmart and got an oil change 
691 2018-06-25 22:25:15 Russian oil bought by PDVSA for Cuba discharges in Curaçao...
692 2018-06-25 22:25:10 We want renewables.
Invest in renewables.
Divest in energy that destroys our landscape.
Coal, gas, oil...theres no future in these.
693 2018-06-25 22:25:08 I watched the Babish episode on it and it did make me really wanna make it myself but yeah the amount of oil you need (like, a whole pot of it for a lot of dishes) is one of the things that keeps me away from fried foods a lot unfortunately
694 2018-06-25 22:25:04 If I'm super lucky, I might be able to dig out a pic of my CB250RS, what a cracking little bike. Mine was black, with the blue stripe and the knackered alternator, wanky mesh oil filter etc.
695 2018-06-25 22:24:51 Why did my FRUNK and Charge Port door fail the day after receiving my car?  Why is it taking over 6 weeks to get the parts and make the repairs?  Is this the big oil companies/automotive competition or Tesla self inflicting these wounds?
696 2018-06-25 22:24:47 #EIA pegs average US #retail #gasoline price $2.833 -4.6 cents vs week ago but +54.5c vs year ago. #Diesel -2.8c vs week ago & +75.1c vs year ago. Gasoline demand 4-wk avg is only -88,000 bpd vs year ago, resilient as usual as spending just shifts from another sector. #OOTT #oil
697 2018-06-25 22:24:34 So what should you think about a President who breaks an international deal so his donors will make more profit with higher oil prices and then starts a trade war that threatens to cause a recession in the US?

698 2018-06-25 22:24:15 i literally haven’t washed my face in a week. only wiped it in the morning with a wet face cloth and my skin looks better than ever??? just exfoliated and applied an oil. watch i wake up with 5 zits
699 2018-06-25 22:24:09 Feeling productive today! Unpacked my bags, washed clothes, changed my oil and took the old oil back to be disposed of, washed my car, and took out trash. Plus, I put my degree from Tech on display  Now it’s grill time!!!

701 2018-06-25 22:23:47 Laker leadership is a joke. Rob Pelinka is a snake oil salesman and Magic is just cheesy. Clippers will overtake them in a couple of years if LBJ doesn’t save those 2 clowns.
702 2018-06-25 22:23:44 love getting oil changes at Walmart cuz while I’m waiting at least 15 workers ask if I need help

like yes I do but nothing you can help me with
703 2018-06-25 22:23:43 How dare bathroom cabinets be like this. Where you take one thing out and 3 things fall down and everything else clunks about and then you put everything back but while it all fit before it doesn’t now. And oh look, my bath oil has fallen down the toilet. Utter prick of a cabinet
704 2018-06-25 22:23:41 @elonmusk, if you succeed it will destroy the oil industry, the petro-dollar and all countries that are net exporters of oil.  Do you have a plan to help all those people and economies around the world to recover?
705 2018-06-25 22:23:30 No, it's failing. The fact that we have to send our oil (which we apparently don't have, according to your argument) to Singapore for refining, is testament to that. You contradict yourself so often that it is hard to take you seriously.
706 2018-06-25 22:23:16 White people go see movie = Cultural appropriation.
White people don't see movie = Racist.
707 2018-06-25 22:23:15 But they understood tariffs and that a more free market approach to health care would lower costs. I don't used car insurance to get oil changes why do I need health insurance to see if I have the flu or a sinus infection?
708 2018-06-25 22:23:04 Hey Harley Trumplers hogs, made, not in the USA. Do you remember the AMC Harley's, all you need is some cat litter for the leaking oil. How about them jobs.
709 2018-06-25 22:22:56 @SkinnyTanHQ I've just received my order today and the bottles have broken in transit. When I opened the bag is was swimming in oil. Really surprised that the bottles hadn't been bubble wrapped... They'd just been put in a plastic bag 
710 2018-06-25 22:22:55 I did a brief Google. First item that came up was a Forbes magazine article that said oil production in the U.S. increased the last seven years of his presidency.
711 2018-06-25 22:22:36 hows that derailed train full of oil doing?
712 2018-06-25 22:22:29 Love ya like cake, TeaPain - BUT - #HardlyDrivenson whined to congress to enact tariffs on imported motorcycles over 750cc back in the 80’s, b/c their inferior product was waning (again) in sales, during that decade’s oil crisis. 
#HardlyDrivenson is an #AmericanFarce
713 2018-06-25 22:22:28 Heat 1-2 clove garlic in oil in large pan, add collards chopped with 1/2c water, 2tbs apple cider vinegar, dash red pepper flakes, salt&pep. When kinda wilted, cover and turn to low, cook until water gone. Add Tabasco as desired.
714 2018-06-25 22:22:22 ...I went for an oil change. So much happening on my feed I get easily sucked in.
715 2018-06-25 22:22:20 I’m not one to brag about coconut oil but in a fit of desperation I just used it to easily get oil based paint and polyurethane off my hands.
716 2018-06-25 22:22:16 I say this because I strongly believe that Nige doesn't really know his arsehole from his elbow. He's a cad & a snake oil salesman, sure but being certain of the referendum result that night & playing doom & gloom just isn't him, an actor he is not
717 2018-06-25 22:22:09 I'm getting an oil change in my car right now and the mechanic just showed me the oil that was in it and said something to me as if it means anything to me and I just smiled and thanked him :)))
718 2018-06-25 22:22:08 peppermint oil?
719 2018-06-25 22:21:58 coconut oil and raw shea butter is my everyday essentials.
720 2018-06-25 22:21:46 Had to let it cool off before I get on that oil 
721 2018-06-25 22:21:35 That's pretty much what the recipe I found says. It's having me marinate them for 30 minutes in olive oil and garlic, then rest to follow. I'm a terrible cook, we'll see how I can mangle these shramp. (Cats eyeing shramp, thinking, soon, soon you will be mine)
722 2018-06-25 22:21:34 Come to Lagos,you'll be romanced 
723 2018-06-25 22:21:32 Thank You to the staff and management at @ridgehillford in Cambridge, Ontario for squeezing in our Ford E-350 Motorhome for it’s first oil change and tire rotation without an appointment. #travel #rvlife Fast service to get us back on the road!

726 2018-06-25 22:21:28 Oh ffs @CBCEdmonton What does it matter WHERE the oil was from?  It could've been American oil in those cars. Or chemicals. American rail system has nothing to do with us.

728 2018-06-25 22:21:05 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
729 2018-06-25 22:21:05 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

748 2018-06-25 22:18:09 Canadians can't compete with American businesses. Bad leadership, taxes, hypocritical policies, America sells Canada lots of oil which is a big part of the canadian deficit. They also do more for the environment selling natural gas. @phcouillard u still have time to honor 106.
749 2018-06-25 22:17:33 I own a business that designs and manufactures components for oil and gas fields around the world, and suddenly the geezer who brought us a “Beer & Burger” is giving us business tips and extolling the virtues of Brexit? Fuck. Right. Off. #newsnight

754 2018-06-25 22:17:04 2/ Data flows - the new oil - had multiplied many times since then. You're trying to rescusitate a dead industrial era. It is gone and the digital age promises far higher living standards. /3
755 2018-06-25 22:16:53 It’s funny; he’s like most mid-level management at a typical American oil company. Maybe add “Gentlemen’s Clubs” to the mix.
756 2018-06-25 22:16:48 I got an oil diffuser and I’m so in love with it
757 2018-06-25 22:16:48 You can bleach it if you put coconut oil in it after
758 2018-06-25 22:16:44 Nope. You're not talking about regulation. You're talking about government ownership. Two different things. We have a privatised oil and gas industry, which is failing, and it is not regulation that is causing it.
759 2018-06-25 22:16:37 on that note, would be good to follow @ShaleProfile  as well.  Great data set for tight oil production by basin in the US.

786 2018-06-25 22:13:03 Food stamps aren't necessarily the most expensive assistance the federal government provides...we still pay subsidies to oil companies. On the other end of the wealth spectrum, but it's still a form of welfare...corporate welfare.

We are at 11 (and could hit 12 at the end of the year). He also tried to undermine the EIA. He is not a credible source for oil information. #WTI #Oil #OOTT

835 2018-06-25 22:06:56 Muslim or not Muslim, this killings are bad!! It's just sad for the northerners as we're so poor in media!! We don't voice out! We really need to do something and stop that our 'haka Allah ya rubata, it's qaddara' while sitting behind and do nothing!!
836 2018-06-25 22:06:43 Even if it isn’t real (I am 99% sure it is) lots of good reasons to be less wasteful and burn less oil, coal and gas anyway.
837 2018-06-25 22:06:42 How will this effect smaller producers of CBD oil?
838 2018-06-25 22:06:17 Oh boy oil light is acting funky so I gotta wait for my car to cool off

841 2018-06-25 22:06:02 Mine hasn't developed that smell yet. I think there has to be some sort of magical oil leak/water ingress formula that creates it.

845 2018-06-25 22:05:11 Because of shortage of materials like lubricating oil, shoe material and other products, the US government legalized hemp cultivation in 1937.

846 2018-06-25 22:05:01 My room smells like peppermint!! Why? you ask? Well let me tell you. My Grandma has one of those essential oil diffusers (the thingy you put water in, add the oil to it and it lights up in all sorts of pretty colors? Yes that!) So yeah. I bought peppermint essential oil today.
847 2018-06-25 22:04:40 an oil change for my car costs $75 wtf

853 2018-06-25 22:03:50 My car smells like olive oil and garlic. #dreamsdocometrue
854 2018-06-25 22:03:47 Yeah, good thing they didn't ship that oil via pipeline, eh, Mikey?

Every time a tanker car train derails -- thank Greenpeace and @MikeHudema

856 2018-06-25 22:03:11 I use a mix of castor oil and almond oil. I rub it into my scalp and hair 2-3 times a week. I leave it on overnight.
857 2018-06-25 22:03:11 Oil sands are a natural thing.saskatchewan has more of it than alberta.that picture just looks like oil sands to me
858 2018-06-25 22:03:11 @elonmusk   Such things will lose you points while you are preparing to enter the Middle East market. All the cars and the oil lobbies are in a war. -2 -

860 2018-06-25 22:03:05 oil is car moisturiser
861 2018-06-25 22:02:51 I thought their mission was to slowly close off more and more of the ocean to US Navy submarine SONAR testing, American commercial fishing, and American oil exploration.  Who knew they were a "climate" agency?
862 2018-06-25 22:02:40 Cool. I have used Elf Moto 4 XT Tech oil. Very hard to find in the USA. Good oil for my ZX9R.
863 2018-06-25 22:02:35 Ewww I hate oil, makes me cringe at the thought of touching it
864 2018-06-25 22:02:29 I love "I love you, but..." I Stood against Fascist my whole freakin life. I stood at Standing Rock. Fascism for oil. I'm not a Good German, I'm a Good Indian. And If I didn't care, I wouldn't be on here.
865 2018-06-25 22:02:23 Algun dia voy a explotar
866 2018-06-25 22:02:19 There used to be a feral orange cat that lived at the oil refinery and he had big balls so guess what we called him? If you guessed Big Balls you win the respect of everyone I work w/ and me.
867 2018-06-25 22:02:08 And if your talking about oil maybe you should read where U.S gets it's oil dumbass.America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico
868 2018-06-25 22:01:53 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator @EPAScottPruitt tried to recruit top executives from oil and gas trading groups to jobs within the agency, according to emails obtained through an Freedom of Information Act request.

870 2018-06-25 22:01:42 Next thing on my list is an engine rebuild as it just throws its oil out of the exhaust and doesn't make much power at the moment. I know guys are making silly powered EV 911s and other classics at the moment so hopefully that becomes more accessible when my engine gives in.

872 2018-06-25 22:01:21 Coconut oil on the beard ju heard
873 2018-06-25 22:01:20 My go-to answer for everything is coconut oil. Keep any kind of moisturizer on your face.
874 2018-06-25 22:01:17 oh yuck thats the WORST! I once burpied after taking fish oil and that was hell and a half ALREADY rip...
875 2018-06-25 22:01:16 That mess will continue for years to come.  The US destabilized the area just like it did w/ South & Central America.  The Saudi's are running out of oil, so they're starting to diversify their businesses.  They do have $$$ & Trump has investments over there.  Trump is making $!
876 2018-06-25 22:01:04 Yup. Try natural oils. I make a blend but I find grapeseed or jojoba work wonders. I just rub the oil on my face and eyes, wait a minute or two and then remove with a warm famp cloth. I have organic cotton wash clothes...just run them under hot water).
877 2018-06-25 22:00:57 Happy Birthday Bishop Nosa Joseph Izevbuwa

879 2018-06-25 22:00:50 The oil companies know climate change is real, therefore Tillerson knows and the Republicans know.  But their agenda is let Trump grab all the public attention while they are busy dismantling programs that combat climate change, plus dismantling support for people in need.
880 2018-06-25 22:00:42 Never get upset at persecution, because the wounds only allow the oil to flow out of them.........He that hath an ear let him hear......

I'm here all week.
889 2018-06-25 21:59:56 Eat low carb, high fat, moderate protein. Avoid sugar. Avoid milk. Avoid anything labelled "low fat", "low calorie", "diet". Good foods: meat, fish, avocados, eggs, cheese, olives, olive oil, greens, tomatoes, asparagus, courgettes, cauliflower...
890 2018-06-25 21:59:56 Probably a tiny amount compared with the Trillions different governments have spent fighting over oil not to mention the lives lost in the process. EVs bring it on 
891 2018-06-25 21:59:33 Coconut oil that scalp babygirl 
892 2018-06-25 21:59:31 Emily really misses the snake oil salesman that use to sit in President Trump’s chair. #GetOverIt
893 2018-06-25 21:59:17 Hitch up ole Bessy & head out yonder to trade eggs for lamp oil & writing tablets so's I's can learn my kids their letters. Yup, regression to the good ol' days. For most of us. Think trump or daughter/wife will slosh it thru?  Ending greatness isn't great
894 2018-06-25 21:59:12 I have this ring on and it’s been on for three days now, I can’t remove it. Tried soapy water, oil and it won’t come off. Something happened to my knuckle, it grew or I have arthritis. Send help! I’m married to myself 
895 2018-06-25 21:59:04 I just joined in early March
896 2018-06-25 21:58:52 Thats the thing man, 
Dont wanna talk politics but football is great for breaking barriers
the Iranian ppl hate their own government & LOVE the west,but even that very government was fighting to get rid of isis
Trumps sanctions is only to manipulate oil price for $
897 2018-06-25 21:58:44 You have a degree in fracking and work for an oil company, so your comment will be taken with a pinch of salt. Should we not be looking for cleaner sources of gas, e.g. biomethane?
898 2018-06-25 21:58:43 Oil sands don't have tailings hard rock mines do or don't y need computers . Their all made from oil and metals. Throw your phone away dum ass
899 2018-06-25 21:58:42 Oil + waterslide actually slows you down. Don't ask me how I know 
900 2018-06-25 21:58:23 We do have two other flavors that have zero sugar in it. They are our Black Garlic and Wasabi Mayo flavors. We are working on reformulating our avocado oil mayo to have no sugar. It will help reduce the tangy and sweetness you are mentioning.

905 2018-06-25 21:57:44 Oil at least tangible
906 2018-06-25 21:57:40 Any oil perfume.. Thank me later
907 2018-06-25 21:57:39 If you wish to discuss @Bombardier then let's do so.  Right now we're talking about #Oil and one has no relevance over the other.  They're all #Corporatewelfare bums.
908 2018-06-25 21:57:22 supply. But today, the US is the third-largest oil producer in the world, it is less dependent on oil imports than at any point in the last 40 years, and it is stealing customers from Russia and Saudi Arabia even with prices as low as $50 per barrel.
909 2018-06-25 21:57:15 You know what might work?  An olive oil infused beer.
910 2018-06-25 21:57:01 Dow, S&P, Small cap, global, gold, oil.......everything in the red. Still – a correction is not “blood in the streets,” but a good time to be buying, diversifying, Dollar cost averaging.
911 2018-06-25 21:56:48 Oil change time. 
For my car and me lol
912 2018-06-25 21:56:37 You cannot over-regulate oil and gas. Both from the perspective of reigning in outright greed and from the perspective of safety. You're not actually in oil and gas, are you?
913 2018-06-25 21:56:31 Can I use castor oil on my hair but not mix it with anything??? Like what’s everyone’s routine how do I use it
914 2018-06-25 21:56:10 Oh my goodness.just like in America...no different than the japenese interment camps..how could this be happening.but hey lets forget about real issues facing Americans rampent black on black crime.the industrialization of crack dealing.the wars for opium and oil.lack of jobs
915 2018-06-25 21:55:57 Yes. Visit Utah and watch American parks get sold to oil and gas exploration and ruined under trump. Shameful of you Utah.

917 2018-06-25 21:55:53 Don't you have some political tweets to RT? Some cannabis oil to hawk? Some other little kids to attempt to get under their skin? Some of your 15 follower bots to entertain?
918 2018-06-25 21:55:42 First, Trump has increased American oil and energy exports. This was already trending before he was elected, but now it’s really gaining steam. Only a decade ago, Americans were concerned about relying too much on the Saudis or other Middle Eastern nations for their energy
919 2018-06-25 21:55:37 Don’t scratch ! Get you some bio oil! Babygirl stretching you out!

922 2018-06-25 21:55:02 Actual first pasta recipe I've seen to use canola oil.

945 2018-06-25 21:52:16 I’ve lived in San Angelo. I refuse to go back and visit. It’s 100 degrees and a shithole with nothing but Mesquite trees, rattle snakes, oil and Republicans. Damn.

959 2018-06-25 21:50:36 HoR&LNA attempted to sell the oil through a new bank account in UAE but it didn't work. If the central bank in the east of Libya hasn't been recognised, this applies to the new setup of NOC - the international community won't allow selling the oil outside Tripoli CLB account.

974 2018-06-25 21:48:20 have yall ever got on your hands and knees and sucked the dick of the Oil spots on the asphalt and driveway by scrubbing it the fuck down with a handbrush and trisodium phosphate???? I THINK NOT!
975 2018-06-25 21:48:04 Now that is a thick cut. Why do you have oil in the pot tho? I don’t have anything in my skillet when I do mine
976 2018-06-25 21:48:04 What forex reader didn't? Not to mention oil, you know these foreign companies operating in the UK taking our natural reserves are getting an absolute bargain these days, no wonder some have doubled and even tripped their output
977 2018-06-25 21:47:52 Historically, just like the Indians “gave away” land for free, Saudi’s “sold” oil for $1 a barrel. The gulf (oil) war, and many other destabilizations are all for our (American) interests. Agree your statement is true, but things didn’t get this way on their own.
978 2018-06-25 21:47:47 Gave my daddy a drop of CBD oil under his tongue today... within 5 minutes, his tremors stopped.  O was so happy I cried and so did my sister! Then we got mad,  I mean hillbilly bad,  with tears and rage!!! #cannabisforparkinsons
979 2018-06-25 21:47:40 my mom used to get pissed bc there was always that extra oil packet lol
980 2018-06-25 21:47:37 Bloody oil companies, ridiculous rises over the last month or so. At least Dick Turpin wore a mask!
981 2018-06-25 21:47:19 @qvc this Juniors Cheesecake guy cannot stop interrupting the hosts. And he stares at the monitor like a snake oil salesman.  Cannot buy anything from this guy. So rude! #juniorscheescake #qvc

983 2018-06-25 21:46:52 Where you get ur oil from
984 2018-06-25 21:46:45 Dear NZ, PEPANZ is just the paid lobby body for the oil and gas companies in this country. Do not give them more cred than they warrant. *missed billions* - oh really? @ninetonoon
985 2018-06-25 21:46:39 all you gotta do is feel good
986 2018-06-25 21:46:24 We need to get rid of Notley and her NDP and bring in pro economy, pro oil Liberals to make something happen here.  "Little Trump" Kenney is knockin at the door and we must impede this redneck agenda.

987 2018-06-25 21:46:19 “I know fish, fish are great. Fish love oil. They LOVE it, can’t get enough of it. Also I would do my daughter in a heartbeat.”
988 2018-06-25 21:46:18 Stupid move by Haftar. Eastern ‘NOC’ will not be able to sell a single barrel of oil. 

#Libya
989 2018-06-25 21:46:18 予想通り追い上げヤバい
990 2018-06-25 21:46:05 Your thinking of Gibson guitar. Obama sued them but didn't sue the Dem companies for the same thing. Selective suing by Obama.
991 2018-06-25 21:45:55 Invest in some lavender essential oil! It’ll help as they don’t like the smell of it. I use it for Madison.
992 2018-06-25 21:45:36 The article is somewhat idiotic. It has nothing to do with french fries and everything to do with vegetable oil and salt. Lots of things you can do to avoid both those factors. Bake them to skip the oil and either llightly salt them or skip the salt completely.
993 2018-06-25 21:45:29 Yes, but let me guess... YOU have ALL the answers. You are a snake oil salesman of the highest degree. How many times in last 15 years have you predicted the end of the world? A dozen?
994 2018-06-25 21:45:19 Ima start buying me some weed i really need to buy some more oil for my pen 
995 2018-06-25 21:45:17 Christian theocracy ruined american economy with all their oil saint wars!
996 2018-06-25 21:45:16 ありがとうございます！ ぜひ今度施術を受けさせてください！
997 2018-06-25 21:45:14 I Put Oil On My Scalp Every Night, How Is It Dry Satan ? HOW ?
998 2018-06-25 21:45:10 Ahaha so was I after reading it so I did some digging and found out that oil is banned for health reasons but fake tan is allowed 
999 2018-06-25 21:45:02 i really need to get my oil changed
1000 2018-06-25 21:44:59 this is the most Berkeley Hipster shit I've ever done but I got olive oil soap for the hecks and giggles and..... I really like it? and I like the kinda earthy smell??
1001 2018-06-25 21:44:56 Sometimes I think discovering crude oil was the beginning of our curse
1002 2018-06-25 21:44:53 Umm...The young guy’s pink hat looks like cow udders!!! Ha ha ha! #WWG1WGA #MAGA #PedoGate
1003 2018-06-25 21:44:40 Shout out to my dad who gives me free oil changes while I’m at work
1004 2018-06-25 21:44:29 Actually, I know a lot about refinery economics and oil and gas in general, especially the regulatory side of things. Lack of investment is the key to where we find ourselves now. We could have been "World scale" were it not for greed.
1005 2018-06-25 21:44:27 I completed everything I needed to do today ,  except my oil change lol
1006 2018-06-25 21:44:16 Oil
1007 2018-06-25 21:44:13 Just put some coconut oil on me lashes so theyd grow but put so much on that I canny see anything #justwantlonglashes #woops
1008 2018-06-25 21:44:04 Try taking evening primrose oil daily. Helps with balancing hormones. And/or Ashwaganda to help calm the nerves.

1010 2018-06-25 21:43:49 Have you got anything with lavender oil in it.  That may help you to sleep
1011 2018-06-25 21:43:48 It's going to need to prove its superiority to the nutraceutical CBD oil. GW DOES NOT want to do such a study, as it's likely that it will not be able to prove such.
1012 2018-06-25 21:43:47 dont!!!! buy beard oil and butter! use it 2x daily
1013 2018-06-25 21:43:36 Then buy equities levered to oil. Having a stable price for 20 years at these levels means free cash flow for the star producers.
1014 2018-06-25 21:43:05 Tracy is all over it trying to make the world of OOTT money on ALL FRONTS (not just oil.)  Absolutely love your tweets.  Thanks for the great charts too.  Following Chi will make you lots of money!! More then u can imagine.
1015 2018-06-25 21:43:05 CBD oil is not legal in all 50 states.
1016 2018-06-25 21:42:52 Pipeline wars being fought in boardrooms. The war was won before it began. Syria is to Russia what Israel is to America. Saudi wins. Lower oil prices & more liquidity is needed. Persians are on the receiving end on this one #Squeeze, I say open the flood gates & bury these #Mofos
1017 2018-06-25 21:42:44 Ace is honestly the most pampered dog I know. He gets groomed every 2 weeks, coconut oil treats, coconut oil on his feet and nails and fur. Has his teeth brushed regularly, sleeps on my memory foam mattress with a memory foam pillow all day, gets his own steak, etc. 
1018 2018-06-25 21:42:39 Oil change every 3000ish miles and I always overtip unless the service is truly awful. Even then, I give 20 percent. I’ve never been a server but many friends have and they need all the tips they can get!
1019 2018-06-25 21:42:36 They are a net oil producer which is in the process of becoming a net importer over the next few years. They have an economy growing at a phenomenal rate. We neither produce oil, nor grow our economy.
1020 2018-06-25 21:42:33 I need a oil change BAD!
1021 2018-06-25 21:42:33 If he fell he would strike oil 
1022 2018-06-25 21:42:31 @mkraju
That tired old false thought is so common it could be your meme.
1023 2018-06-25 21:42:17 Do we need to be asking if he owns an oil well at this point?with the number of oil wells we have in this country,85m f our people lives in abject poverty! To make it worse they die for the wrong reasons! I repeat I don’t care if he owns one,he shld do the needful
1024 2018-06-25 21:42:07 Cig is leaking oil. I think intuitively he knows he is on the wrong side of history; and instead of accepting it, he lashes out in the only way his simple mind can. With hate.
1025 2018-06-25 21:42:04 What are you taking about? Everyone knows that the southerners are ALL nasty confederate racists... jeez. The Carolinas are awesome!
1026 2018-06-25 21:42:01 Ha ha ha! Mostly paid Losers!  #WWG1WGA #MAGA #PedoGate
1027 2018-06-25 21:41:50 No, you know nothing about refinery economics. Big oil needs 'world scale's refineries to reap economies of scale. Only small refineries in Oz - only good for low overhead mid-sized companies.
1028 2018-06-25 21:41:46 Hey. You retired folks with fixed incomes who voted for this snake oil salesman. Look at your 401 Ks now. How you like him now? Mind a ‘little pain’ which your choice said you’d have to feel?
1029 2018-06-25 21:41:42 Then good luck & i hope you all can overcome it without a bloody civil war, bcs certainly US & allies would riding on it, left your country on chaos & take over the oil reserves.
1030 2018-06-25 21:41:40 Anything but trying to con people into buying snake oil (steaks, airline tickets, football tickets, casino scams, hotels) etc. is just too complicated for an imbecile. This is just one of many effects of stupid decisions. #MAGA
1031 2018-06-25 21:41:39 Response compels me to respond.  Empirical evidence and real life results suggests a Dr with tunnel vision.  You are not upholding Hippocratic oath & have blinders on.  My mother 83yrs benefits immensely from MJ oil capsules for sleep vs myriad of side effects from big pharma.
1032 2018-06-25 21:41:31 Imagine all those people who voted for you, who believed You alone could save their job, now out of work. I honestly feel bad for anyone who bought your snake oil who is now hurting because of it. Take some responsibility for what you did.
1033 2018-06-25 21:41:30 May I say how very beautiful you look , you are stunning , I’m going to send you a pic of me in messenger because so you can put a face to who you are talking to , please don’t be scared when you see what I look like I’m no oil painting lol xxxxc
1034 2018-06-25 21:41:26 I sweat a lot! And natural deodorant isn’t an antiperspirant so it doesn’t help. I’m gonna add tea tree oil and coconut oil to my pits to see if it helps.
1035 2018-06-25 21:41:21 Cool story brah but I am not from the Mideast.
1036 2018-06-25 21:41:15 Should read: The Year’s Fundraiser. California oil is dirtier. Saudi Oil is ethically filthy and dripping in corruption. Canada has the most stringent regulatory safety regime in place on the planet to extract and transport oil. 10s of 1000s rely on it for jobs, but resist away
1037 2018-06-25 21:41:14 THEY ARENT STALE THE OIL JUST WASNT HOT ENOUGH: a novella by a chipotle cashier
1038 2018-06-25 21:41:08 Tea tree oil
1039 2018-06-25 21:41:03 Thank God for tea tree oil.
1040 2018-06-25 21:41:01 Houston. 4th largest city in the US. Most diverse city in the US. Great food scene due to variety of cuisines brought by immigrants from all over the world. Creative land use due to lack of zoning laws. Great community. Underrated because of Texas and oil stereotypes.
1041 2018-06-25 21:40:53 It’s a digital billboard. The message circulated every few seconds. Went out and saw it myself yesterday
1042 2018-06-25 21:40:47 Apparently, his co-writer Steve Carell must've written the good parts of *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*.
1043 2018-06-25 21:40:45 Cannabis oil ftw
1044 2018-06-25 21:40:39 An amazing culture, and it would be so wonderful if the people could reclaim it. They can keep the oil money and the tourist money.
1045 2018-06-25 21:40:35 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
1046 2018-06-25 21:40:35 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1047 2018-06-25 21:40:30 Proof, John!  I want to see official documents charging and/or finding guilt in any one of these false statements.
1048 2018-06-25 21:40:29 I don't use volume measures, only weight for basic sponge, so whatever it says for butter, halve it & same weight of oil. you tend to find the volume/weight only varies by a couple of grams anyway x
1049 2018-06-25 21:40:26 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
1050 2018-06-25 21:40:24  Pizza topped with olive oil, finely sliced mushrooms, bacon, and pineapple.
1051 2018-06-25 21:40:24 U.N. will soon ANNEX JERUSALEM

Jews will build a temple on the MOUNT

Muslims will protest

The U.N. will crack down

Jihad WW3 Religious war

Russia will retake E. Europe

China will defend Muslim nations for OIL

America will DEFEAT China

War ends

NEW U.N. with 7 heads NOT 5
1052 2018-06-25 21:40:24 Just realised the cooking oil I’ve been using for the past 5 months has been out of date since 2013 :)
1053 2018-06-25 21:40:23 Albertans think a flat tax is the best way to spend their oil windfall, so maybe they aren't very good at judging things.
1054 2018-06-25 21:40:14 Voting Green next time I see!
Until Hydrogen and/or Solar with a bit of battery thrown in as well is sorted out we are stuck with oil and fracking.
Better transport infrastructure is needed.
1055 2018-06-25 21:40:12 Hi David. Your pizza with pineapple and motor oil will be delivered in 35 min via truck.
1056 2018-06-25 21:40:06 China owns 1 out of every 4 Hogs in America!  Ok....so they don’t own 1 out of every 4 Harleys but they do own 1 out of every 4 pork hogs.  This all comes from an out of control trade deficit and unfair trade!  America is about to overtake Russia in Oil Production!  USA First!
1057 2018-06-25 21:40:05 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
1058 2018-06-25 21:40:05 Cause if you don't think about it it all goes away. Like the gulf oil spill and Fukushima nuclear meltdown
1059 2018-06-25 21:39:40 Takes me back to playing Drink with Dallas in my student days. Am in AA now. That's what happens after frequent attendance at the Oil Barons' Ball.
1060 2018-06-25 21:39:31 Let's face it, the most corrupt country is the us and Britain, corruption is legalized and called lobbying. Russia sells oil per day more than the Saudis
1061 2018-06-25 21:39:25 Maybe you should leave Harley-Davidson alone. They're just doing what you & family did--started factories overseas! You even used Chinese steel in your buildings, then as soon as you became president you imported Russian steel--didn't use American steel--for your oil pipelines.
1062 2018-06-25 21:39:17 every day DT issues an executive order, a sane person dies a slow emotional death
1063 2018-06-25 21:39:08 The Muslims are bestowed with hundreds of trillions of dollars of oil, gas, solar energy & other resources for which they don’t do any effort. But still the Muslims are facing extreme hunger in Yemen, Gaza, Somalia, Arakan & other Muslim countries. What could be the worst khiana?
1064 2018-06-25 21:39:03 This is exactly what you have to do with it. Cut out some of the big stalks, drizzle the oil and 10 mins max in the oven. It’s actually delicious. Oh and salt it
1065 2018-06-25 21:39:01 It's ur own fault cos u used carrot oil and not  lotion ! ! !
1066 2018-06-25 21:38:24 If it takes at least 120° or greater to liquify solid lard/vegetable oil, etc..  then duh.  It will definitely solidify in our veins.  We only maintain a body temp of 98.6°!

1067 2018-06-25 21:38:08 Oh, no, @RealAlexJones , it's just a hoax. Like SandyHook, right? Stand down, asshat-for-profit. Go sell your protein shakes, Cap't Snake Oil.
1068 2018-06-25 21:38:04 Yeah, everything I’ve made has been pretty tasty. Yeah, you just brush on a small amount of oil and season to taste!
1069 2018-06-25 21:37:57 For sure. Although I talking the actual seed not just oil.
1070 2018-06-25 21:37:39 Where's Jeremy Corbyn? He's down Oil Drum Lane.
1071 2018-06-25 21:37:39 Guessing it’s used in the ‘Legal, ..we’ve got our dirty, greedy, filthy mits on this plant oil’ ‘We CEO’s of the Drugs Companies & their Shareholders play god & decide where we sell’ (NHS? Elsewhere Small quantities combined with other ingredients?)’Ask @JeffDitchfield 
1072 2018-06-25 21:37:32 <living bottle of olive oil
1073 2018-06-25 21:37:23 If there is, it won’t be free. It will be US controlled long enough to get all that sweet sweet oil.

1080 2018-06-25 21:36:54 I used to share a flat with 2 Greek computer science students. They used to fill a wok with oil, stand six feet away and lob frozen oven chips into it. To this day I do not know how I survived that year.
1081 2018-06-25 21:36:49 Thanks so much for this tip.  So wherever it says butter .... as an example....you do half butter and half oil in fluid ounces?
1082 2018-06-25 21:36:49 Yeah :/ plus I can’t use products with almond oil or any tree nut oil, especially lip products (fiancé is severely allergic) and this was like my third bag i couldnt use one of my products for that reasons
1083 2018-06-25 21:36:32 Getting cleansing oil in my mouth is fucking vile. I don't know what was worse, that or the time I got mouthwash in my eye.
1084 2018-06-25 21:36:17 Hey Erin - The Loony Oil Lady thanks for the follow!

1086 2018-06-25 21:35:59 Don't worry Patrick we didn't listen to that snake oil salesman Osbourne when he was chancellor let alone editor of the standard
1087 2018-06-25 21:35:58 Acrylic first then oil is fine! Not visa  versa!
Great fine!
1088 2018-06-25 21:35:47 Better make sure they actually changed your oil, someone mechanics be finessing
1089 2018-06-25 21:35:41 no one tells you, but the green can of Olive Oil hairspray out here lookin like iPhones at 1%: near death but still puttin the work in. thx lil buddy
1090 2018-06-25 21:35:39 Analysts saying the oil industry infrastructure such as transportation which includes trucking hasnt yet caught up with the incredibly high oil output thx to fracking. Expected to be resolved in 4-5 yrs, giving U.S. oil independence.
1091 2018-06-25 21:35:38 A reinvigorating facial mask, pastel green, with lemongrass, olive oil, and exfoliating softwood microbeads. It's a a lemony-smelling powder in a sachet.

1099 2018-06-25 21:34:39 Glad and surprised OPEC to increase production of crude oil as as the Russian leader stated months many ago to be fare to all of us consumers to keep prices of fuel under 2.50 he's a man of his word .
1100 2018-06-25 21:34:32 100mg is an infant dose - it takes at least 1000mg of Whole Plant CBD oil to put a dent in seizures for adults.  This is weak sauce.

1102 2018-06-25 21:34:09 if you ever want a DIY toner, I use: equal parts witch hazel, water, & tea tree oil.

1108 2018-06-25 21:33:18 Eucalyptus essential oil in the diffsure. It’s so lit. I didn’t know it would beat lavender. Any favs y’all recommend?! Lemme know.

1111 2018-06-25 21:32:33 my hair has been laughing at these store hair growth oil blends, so i went back to making my own. regular degular castor oil (stopped using JCBO half a decade ago b/c my hair doesn’t care), coconut oil, and a couple drops of tea tree, peppermint & rosemary essential oils.

1116 2018-06-25 21:32:07 Believe it or not, selling oil is a very short term solution that only a few people benefit from. In the long run it will cost us way more and effect almost everyone on this planet. #cdnpoli
1117 2018-06-25 21:32:05 This is what happens when a snake oil salesman sells you snake oil.
1118 2018-06-25 21:32:03 Jojoba seed oil doesn’t do much for my skin, but I should give it a go for my hair. Glad it’s working for you!
1119 2018-06-25 21:31:56 North Korea has agreed to denuclearize, OPEC has agreed to lower its oil costs, coal is on the rise, the manufacturing jobs that Obama said were gone, are back, bad trade deals like TPP and he got rid of the Obamacare mandate, which was terrible
1120 2018-06-25 21:31:32 We need to close the oil fields to survive catastrophic climate change.
1121 2018-06-25 21:31:30 I would say it's much worse than not helping. Cancel Northern Gateway, no outrage over KXL being rejected and boy genius talking about phasing out the oilsands. With friends like the Liberals who needs enemies. People are quick to blame oil price but that isn't the whole story
1122 2018-06-25 21:31:29 How will the petroleum minister be telling us people with oil wells are the problem... As the president can't he do something if he's really fighting corruption.
1123 2018-06-25 21:31:25 Just purée the kale with strong hard cheese (e.g. parmesan), (preferably olive) oil, garlic, and nuts (pine nuts are traditional but I used cashews).
1124 2018-06-25 21:31:13 Irma, you have a boy, and should be concerned about our environment. The EPA is a joke and 45 need to protect us. By now eat organic of course, but the chemicals are in the air and water.  We need to protect our babies. The EPA needs to protect us, not the oil and pesticide ind
1125 2018-06-25 21:31:11 “Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke me—it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.”

1131 2018-06-25 21:30:30 This yacht is/was owned by Nigerian fugitive and New York playboy Kola Aluko, who is wanted for his role in a $1.76 billion oil scam. It is 213 feet long and worth $80 million. I guess maybe the feds caught up to him and seized it.

1141 2018-06-25 21:29:46 Not me!  That's why I use well seasoned pans whenever I can and just the right amount of oil!
1142 2018-06-25 21:29:29 Afghanistan followed a false flag, Iraq was fake Israeli intelligence and Syria is a proxy war.  America and Europe have no interest in the Middle East.  If we want oil we can buy it, not go to war for it.  The expansionist Greater Israel project is what is causing the problem.
1143 2018-06-25 21:29:10 Yup. I’ve used butter and coconut oil. It’s not awful lol
1144 2018-06-25 21:28:58 Keep trying to sell your snake oil rhetoric, Adam.  Do your job and end illegal immigration!!!!

1151 2018-06-25 21:27:47 I miss cooking for my man, making sure his shower water is perfect, doing face masks, massaging his beard with Argan oil, rolling his woods, folding his clothes.. I love being motherly like I genuinely love loving
1152 2018-06-25 21:27:40 @ValentineShow CBD oil works great in a Rolls Royce. The synthetic stuff is pricey, but your old girl is worth it.

1159 2018-06-25 21:26:50 Our biggest security challenge is catastrophic climate change. We need 1. Space umbrella to buy us some time. 2.Nuclear power3.

1162 2018-06-25 21:26:24 Where do you think RU gets its money from? Oil sales. Where will they sell it if not to EU where their pipelines go? You think US is about to start buying their oil? Makes no economic sense.

 Any good ideas? Because so far just the dumb stuff coming.

1165 2018-06-25 21:25:54 The last thing #Libya NEEDS and we ACCEPT is to be used as a tool for the conflict and competetion between #France and #Italy. Using #Libyan_Oil infrastructure and institutions this way is not only detrimental for Libya but for these competing countries and their regional allies.

1167 2018-06-25 21:25:35 if real supply was 1 million barrels, not only Iran but other members of OPEC would have protested. there is no way I am buying this crap that the increase will be 1 million, it will be at max 700 k but it will be acheived by Q1 2019

Oil&Gas Field service stocks are extremely cheap right now. Like investors don't even know they exists...
1175 2018-06-25 21:23:59 Demand access to whole natural leaf. Big Pharma trying to limit access, sell only oil to dominate market, eliminating independent farmers.  Plenty of room for both!

Just gave you a list of the things I want, if you have a crush on me.
1177 2018-06-25 21:23:32 Would love for @neatsloan and @charlieharding to explain why OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES keeps reverberating inside my head, while not being "traditionally catchy"
1178 2018-06-25 21:23:28 Snake Oil > MCT Oil
1179 2018-06-25 21:23:17 Haha, y'all must really be looking in the wrong places. 
1180 2018-06-25 21:23:05 If you’re making a savory dish – try cooking it and chicken or vegetable stock. A little butter or olive oil is always a good idea too. And plenty of appropriate spices and herbs. Quinoa is pretty bland on its own.

1186 2018-06-25 21:22:01 Well if we’re not supporting the rest of CND we should be fine. Considering they are against our natural resources they should be all for transfer payments being cut completely. Be interesting to see how fast we got our oil to tide water then

1191 2018-06-25 21:21:37 I think that's it. I think this tech wreck could kick in, then I might get bsnk into some FAANG and semis. I'd like to get back into some oil stocks.  Sold most of that that I had since late 15 early 16. May have missed that opportunity last week.
1192 2018-06-25 21:21:16 You can commission an oil painting for £250. Just saying. Just saying.
1193 2018-06-25 21:21:06 Yeah the “image” they were referring to when it came to Michelle Obama was that she wasn’t white. Melania is straight up disrespectful and  visiting an oil spill isn’t immigrant children torn from their parents and hidden somewhere in the U.S.

I love it when Americans call republicans fascists or "fascist enabling".Try a history book.
Nazis were socialists.

Being socialist makes people congregate and murder opponents. It starts with the obscenities and ends in gulags.

1216 2018-06-25 21:17:06 He has never cared for it. He made it abundantly clear during Election debates when he wanted to commit war crimes by “taking their oil” and that “stop & frisk” was good practice even though declared unconstitutional...
1217 2018-06-25 21:17:02 Would you rather or have you already take(n) CBD oil or use the hemp to help with your pain and other ailments rather than opiates or other RX drugs?  What are your thoughts? Are you considering it?

1227 2018-06-25 21:16:12 For a guy who scored 17 goals, but is defensively trouble??… You’re a bit touched hey?.. Clearly not the way the trade worked out either ...Not to mention, who the hell would want a guy who won’t go to Moxie’s?? 
1228 2018-06-25 21:16:05 Statewide, every sport, every year. The problem, i think in west texas, is officials have left to work OT and make more money in oil field than officials make on a given night. Hopefully, @uiltexas has stepped up and given enough raise to keep some of us.
1229 2018-06-25 21:15:57 We did baby oil and kept the hose but we have it on the hill back there so it’s even more fun but it jus falls off the side or makes a huge puddle @ the bottom

1238 2018-06-25 21:14:19 I think that’s a gross overestimate. And the few that are there severally flunked “protest sign 101”.  Those things are harder to read than a 3rd grade science fair display.

1240 2018-06-25 21:13:28 South America is lucky to have a very dense and dangerous rain forest separating it from Central America... and, South American countries with fairly good economies (Chile, Colombia, Argentina) also have very strict immigration rules unlike us

1251 2018-06-25 21:12:39 I made myself a wrap with prosciutto, peppery arugula, fresh jalapeño, & chili oil. So good, and it made me happy after a cranky few days.
1252 2018-06-25 21:12:35 Gettin an oil change they said it’ll be less than an hour why have I been here for TWO hours and they still haven’t started my car ?

1254 2018-06-25 21:11:54 I'm here to get an oil change and boy said "you smoke shortie?" I'm shook amused and disgusted all at the same time
1255 2018-06-25 21:11:33 A question for the Oil Comapnies. Could they provide the costings to produce one barrel of oil from 40 yeas ago and the price it costs now?
1256 2018-06-25 21:11:30 This is the guy that asked where the money would come from to form a Scottish oil fund!!! So understanding is not in his DNA!!!
1257 2018-06-25 21:11:15 Statistically, the midterms should have been an easy pick up for them. But they just cannot stop being batshit crazy.

1261 2018-06-25 21:11:06 And I will never trust a claim from a snake oil salesman. Children were given this drug the entire duration of FDA approval period. It may not be a perfect system but show me a better one?
1262 2018-06-25 21:11:03 Mr integrity that has no regards to rule of laws, who protects thieving friends and associates. Not forgetting missing oil money.
1263 2018-06-25 21:10:47 Maybe Libya with Haftar in control of the oil ports

1279 2018-06-25 21:08:32 You can tell me about your new girl's hot young toned body all you want. I'd rather be a butter body than a butter face any fucking day. I'd never want to trade mine in for that mug she has to walk around with. There's not a gym or enough coconut oil in the world to fix that.
1280 2018-06-25 21:08:25 On the Crude Oil  front there were no major surprises at the OPEC meeting that was not  already priced in the market. There is an outage in the Canadian Sands  which gave a boost to prices this morning.

1284 2018-06-25 21:07:10 I agreed lmao, I’ve been using jojoba oil for maybe roughly 6 months now and it’s worked wonders for me. I honestly felt like this water was overpriced and watered down if that makes sense?? it would have such a strong smell if it wasn’t and it wouldn’t make my face 10x more oily
1285 2018-06-25 21:06:57 biossance has a really nice vitamin c and rose oil it’s like $10 cheaper than Sunday Riley lol
1286 2018-06-25 21:06:57 Dealerships have the best oil.

1288 2018-06-25 21:06:53 Also Some people have smaller pores and/or less oil production than others and can afford to just moisturize thereafter. Those with larger pores can try ice baths to close the pores minimising bacteria re-entry.

1296 2018-06-25 21:05:10 Yes that piece isn't quite right I couldn't remember which compound was the medicinal one. Without THC can legally buy weak oil without prescription.
1297 2018-06-25 21:05:08 The Australian dollar regained some of its former vigor near the end of last week, presumably in part due to the sudden surge of oil prices.The Aussie dollar has long been known as a commodity currency so strengthening in response to oil is no surprise.#dailynews #earn2trade #AUD
1298 2018-06-25 21:05:06 It opens the pores gore o ntshe leswe. Yes , increased blood circulation increases oil production but by applying moisturizer, you reduce sebum production because your skin is hydrated.

1308 2018-06-25 21:03:09 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
1309 2018-06-25 21:03:08 Several years ago, I smuggled a Nalgene bottle of CBD oil out of Colorado so I could treat my son's epilepsy back home in Montana. Glad to see  industry and gov't catching up. Much work remains. @LGS_Foundation @CureEpilepsy

1312 2018-06-25 21:02:59 I'll just marinate a cheap steak for 2-3 days in olive oil and garlic. I cook mine in the oven in pan after quick sear. Haven't replaced bbq since it died and dont really miss it.
1313 2018-06-25 21:02:52 All the old colonial powers want their piece of the oil patch
1314 2018-06-25 21:02:51 Thanks babe! I do anchoitas & use light weight dry oil. Right now I have been loving the OGX Renewing Argan Morocco Weightless Healing Dry Oil. Smells sooo good!
1315 2018-06-25 21:02:25 It's called 'bulletproof' coffee, and it's supposed to be a way to burn fat more efficiently and give you a huge energy boost. I can also be done with coconut oil.

1317 2018-06-25 21:02:18 @CV_Sciences It seems Plus CBD Oil needs more awareness. "Plus CBD Oil advertises their tinctures as being “America’s #1 Choice for CBD Products,” and that’s actually probably not far from the truth. We’re not sure exactly what metrics they used to come up with that claim"

1328 2018-06-25 21:01:09 They are not attracted to lemons haha so it's a win for you. You could you a lemon scented oil as mosquito spray
1329 2018-06-25 21:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and was never deported.
1330 2018-06-25 21:00:48 Put coconut oil on my nails the other day before I did gels. It’s fair to say they have not stayed on...

1334 2018-06-25 21:00:41 I heard that a bit of peppermint oil does wonders for pain.
1335 2018-06-25 21:00:31 Yes, I even diffuse peppermint oil so I can constantly smell it. :/ Nothing really works.
1336 2018-06-25 21:00:29 Nope!! She and her snake oil preacher daddy grew up in my home state. They push my gag response to the limit!
1337 2018-06-25 21:00:24 What type of oil did you use?
1338 2018-06-25 21:00:14 June 25, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1342 2018-06-25 20:59:57 Actually the Oil are in rough shape capwise despite their best player taking a discount.
1343 2018-06-25 20:59:53 We are not fuckin oil paintings, we don’t have to be perfect!
1344 2018-06-25 20:59:38 I love baby oil but my skin is too sensitive for all the fragrance in it
1345 2018-06-25 20:59:36 The pills also went through the same rigorous proving ground. That is right there in FDA letter about cannabis. Its how it works if you want to be considered a medicine or you resort to wild claims of snake oil quality being the standard.
1346 2018-06-25 20:59:32 Segunda pregunta que les hago. La primera NUNCA me la respondieron. Ya se puede consumir y vender legalmente el CBD oil en Mexico? Espero que por amabilidad, seriedad con sus seguidores como yo, y EDUCACION, respondan a esta pregunta. PD: Respondan los Twitts de sus seguidores.
1347 2018-06-25 20:59:22 Pretty sure the US asking OPEC to produce more oil to keep prices down means the US is anything but energy independent. Texas energy sector is indeed awesome but let's not get carried away.

1355 2018-06-25 20:57:39 Her tongue doesn’t reach the bridge of her nose which is where I put it. I put coconut oil on her nose at night cause it’s always dry but she kinda licks it.
1356 2018-06-25 20:57:29 Actual belief: I wouldn’t serve her in a restaurant that I owned or worked in. I wouldn’t serve her at a drive-thru window. I wouldn’t check her out at the grocery store. I wouldn’t change the oil in her car. Clear?
1357 2018-06-25 20:57:12 Death by agriculture, clearing and poaching for potions and powders. So anywhere where they do that... which is most places for agriculture and clearing sadly. Palm oil is probably the most telling example of that at the moment

1361 2018-06-25 20:56:34 They tryna pressure me into running a diagnostic on my car. GIMME MY OIL CHANGE DAMNIT !!!!!
1362 2018-06-25 20:56:34 Again. I don't disagree at all. There has to be restorative justice for those who have been incarcerated for pot. It's injustice and a travesty.  

I was merely pointing out that she isn't selling pot - CBD oil is not the same thing.
1363 2018-06-25 20:56:33 I did this wish fish oil once. Don’t do that.
1364 2018-06-25 20:56:33 We can make a treaty with Russia to bar all oil and natural gas to the EU.
1365 2018-06-25 20:56:31 Your only advise is to hold for the long term. If that's your only advise, then your reports are worthless. So to sum it up, your reports are incorrect, and we dont need them anyway because you simply want us to hold for the long term. You sell snake oil sir.
1366 2018-06-25 20:56:20 Im sure it works. My issue is that the good ol FDA's stamp of approval is out in front of a pharmaceutical but still wont recognize cannabis. 17 States still prohibit simple cbd oil, but here take our new pill. Glad they have an option, but bet ur ass itll be very expensive.
1367 2018-06-25 20:56:18 @NatalieEgenolf Mike's dog probably got into and he touched her.  Poison Ivy doesn't spread through the air unless it is burned. The Urisol oil the plant produces can stay active on others surfaces for a long time too.
1368 2018-06-25 20:56:16 the one I saw is the CBD oil under the tongue I believe!
1369 2018-06-25 20:56:13 There’s a heavy scent of smoke and oil on this bus.. I lowkey wanna get off but I’m still like 30 mins away from home.

1371 2018-06-25 20:56:03 Oh, I was confining myself to the link, which is trying very, very hard to say the world's running out of oil, which it is patently not.

1373 2018-06-25 20:55:47 When @OrnamentalMatt first brought home a burrata, the person who sold it to him recommended serving with a bit of olive oil, some salt and pepper. He poured a cup of oil over the top. Next time I brought it up with the cheesemonger. "oh, you only need about a tbsp", she said.
1374 2018-06-25 20:55:42 Sure... critical enough to suggest the only player on the Oilers he could be traded for was McDavid.. sounds like your changing your tune on Hamilton to me

1377 2018-06-25 20:55:21 Didn’t look at my phone all morning so I’d have something to do while I take my car to get my oil changed.
1378 2018-06-25 20:55:02 No. Controlled use of prescribed cannabis oil it for medical reasons.
The fallacy that cannabis is harmless needs to stop. 
For some it’s s gateway to the hell of hard drugs or psychosis. 
Yes, alcohol is also abused, but that shouldn’t be an argument to legalise pot
1379 2018-06-25 20:55:00 for some reason I have a deep hatred for getting my oil changed....
1380 2018-06-25 20:54:58 And I've been buying my hemp oil from Amazon when I could have been getting it from a TARDIS. :-o

1390 2018-06-25 20:54:13 Before getting ready for the day, one must always check the state of their coconut oil. Liquid? Shorts it is!
1391 2018-06-25 20:54:10 Wow...you went from being too stupid to understand some oil industry basics to lashing out with insults in just a few minutes!  I’m guessing understanding oil’s role in BC’s economy is beyond your grasp too.

1395 2018-06-25 20:53:34 only because they have oil
Nicaragua is executing citizens the month of June yet zero media coverage
so be fair and say who cares or give some love to non-oil producing nations also
1396 2018-06-25 20:53:29 Agree, shipping oil by rail is NUTS! #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli #bcpoli #KeepItInTheGround #WaterIsLife
1397 2018-06-25 20:53:28 Where has MSNBC been, Oh, I forgot they've been spreading propaganda!  @potus 2 DAYS AGO got OPEC to reduce the price of oil!!  Get with the real news MSNBC!
1398 2018-06-25 20:53:19 Help I moisturised with too much coconut oil and now I can't sit in a chair without slipping around like an eel on an icerink

1402 2018-06-25 20:52:30 Feels like colonization once again, these hijos de puta have just invaded Morocco, the Portuguese went middle east and we're lucky the gringos didn't show up, could be adding our oil wells in their will already. #ESPMAR
1403 2018-06-25 20:52:29 I hate oil change places when they try to upsell me. Man I can change my own air filter lmfao
1404 2018-06-25 20:52:24 Are you gonna report that it's coming back next week, a month ahead of expectations or it doesn't fit with the oil price view?
1405 2018-06-25 20:52:23 Are its taking it way from oil and gas.and nuclear  They cant do that.   Much prefer green energy
1406 2018-06-25 20:52:22 "alright hand over your man card"

Ok it's covered in motor oil at the bottom of the toolbox in the bed of my f350. Don't cut yourself on all the knives. Also watch out for my Rottweiler he only likes me and not my bitch wife. Yee Yee
1407 2018-06-25 20:52:15 La decada del 90 no puede usarse como base para comparar porque no habia retenciones y todos loa demas impuestos cheque gas oil ibrutos que destruyeron la competitividad porque ningun socio comercial los puso.

Maybe its because I don't spend my whole time in the echo chamber, giving twitter reach arounds, to people who think just like me? Just a theory.
1412 2018-06-25 20:51:55 So, medical marijuana dispensaries who have the oil that has help people with seizures for very little money. Is now going to be produced by a pharma. Can't wait to see how much that will cost. Well at least it will probably be decriminalize d that big $ wants it.
1413 2018-06-25 20:51:55 It took twice as long as it should have to get my oil changed.
1414 2018-06-25 20:51:45 I baked it at 180C. Prepped it with vegetables oil. Cake raspberry and white chocolate. After being baked, I left it in the tin for about 20 min. And then nothing cake out 
1415 2018-06-25 20:51:38 FeelsBadMan So I know enough about cars to change the oil, and basic stuff... Went to get oil and a filter but the store gave me the wrong filter but of course I don't notice out of ignorance. I went to install it and it doesn't fit.
1416 2018-06-25 20:51:13 You are right Rachel.  I heard on one of the news channel that Russia wants to run an oil pipeline through North and South Korea.  America barely gets the door open and China and Russia run in to try and scoop up the opportunities.  Arm Chair Reporter

1421 2018-06-25 20:50:42 I don’t believe you have a clue nor understand how much of resources (coal, gas or oil) it takes to generate the needed additional electricity to power electric cars?
1422 2018-06-25 20:50:38 It really isn’t like Auschwitz. That is like comparing your car leaking oil to the BP oil spill.

1424 2018-06-25 20:50:20 If the Benghazi-based NOC tries to sell oil without transferring the revenue into the official, Tripoli-based Central Bank, the endeavor is likely to backfire.

1429 2018-06-25 20:49:31 I have been researching lately. CDB oil has <.03% mgTHC the source for hallucinogenic effects. It takes > 20%THC for it to b hallucigenic. Again, don't know much & as I said I tried both plain Hemp oil ZERO THC & CBD OIL; minute amount THC. No relief.
1430 2018-06-25 20:49:30 There are varying levels of that,some of which may still be possible. But at least one of the snake oil salesman peddling that product has at various past times claimed that Comey was pro Trump, Mueller is a white hat, & Flynn deliberately fibbed to the FBI to set himself up. /1

1455 2018-06-25 20:46:40 I always tip at least 20% whether my service was good or bad. You just never know what people are going through. As far as my oil, let’s just say it would be better off if it was a server 
1456 2018-06-25 20:46:27 You reminded me I bought lemon oil to keep at my desk and cheer me up. I'd left it in my bag. Thank you! :D

1458 2018-06-25 20:46:22 I can’t wait for the day when I make enough money that when I get my oil changed I can also afford all of the additional services they tell me I need. Won’t that be something.
1459 2018-06-25 20:46:20 So the sole driver of a decision whether to continue drilling is, big surprise, the oil industry themselves. Has anyone got that link from @simonjbridges on Campbell Live all those years ago? Classssssic

1530 2018-06-25 20:37:02 They tried in the 1950’s to put an oil refinery on the MD side across from beatiful MtVernon and a wise Congresswoman stopped it.
1531 2018-06-25 20:37:00 jhope pursued by the pears, oil on canvas
1532 2018-06-25 20:36:56 They're excellent crisps. Full of oil too so healthy.
1533 2018-06-25 20:36:44 Hasatan has certainly stepped up the game he knows his time here is short! We are God’s army until Jesus returns with His sort! But you won’t be caught by surprise, you will have enough oil for your lamp you’re on the right path now
1534 2018-06-25 20:36:41 You beat me to it!  I will take the oil of cloves though.
1535 2018-06-25 20:36:39 Simple fact is that some GNA persons are aligned with Jadhran, some sectors in Misrata facilitated the attack, why would any normal sane person give oil revenues  to thise who support and facilitate terrorism. Let the Mufti and MB answer this question #libya
1536 2018-06-25 20:36:35 Same for me! My autistic son gets relief from some of his symptoms. CBD oil is apparently a miracle for so many.  When it becomes legal here I’ll be first in line!
1537 2018-06-25 20:36:27 That's an excellent point - the quality of food is definitely a factor into its overall healthiness. If a person makes fries at home without all the salt, and using healthier oil, it's no doubt significantly better.

1542 2018-06-25 20:36:14 Who needs an RX? CBD Oil 100 mg. from hemp is available on Amazon. I use it and use on my dog to calm him down when traveling. It's good medicine.
1543 2018-06-25 20:36:00 Big deal. It’s some kind of publicity stunt and you shouldn’t even be covering it. The regime still has an  atrocious attitude to women. Also the country is filthy rich from producing oil (petrol). Go figure
1544 2018-06-25 20:35:59 That's right I saw that just now actually.  Remember, to keep compliance with the OPEC+ deal, Russia has to win ight lol

1552 2018-06-25 20:34:53 Mara this one smell like original castor oil,I dont think I will be able to handle the smell. Bad memories. Reminds me of koko, thupa and myself screaming and running around the house before being forced to drink it.

1557 2018-06-25 20:34:24 Don't fry with olive oil, low smoke point. Try grapeseed or groundnut.
Add seasoning to oil to transfer the flavour into the food
Cover the pan to cook the top of the eggs via steaming
Fry bread with butter, not oil
Pro tip: use duck eggs for a much richer yolk, and a cob bread
1558 2018-06-25 20:34:17 OMG Twitter cut off the top of the oil bottle in the preview pic and I thought that was a weird green beer with a foam head! I was like, GURL WHAT IS YOU DRINKING!!!?! LOL!!
1559 2018-06-25 20:34:13 People are more valuable than land, money, and power put together, because without people, there is none to lead, governments go extinct, and gold, silver, oil, ivory, you name it, all is rendered worthless without people to give it a purpose!

1572 2018-06-25 20:32:39 If they stick to their plan that billboard will be up for awhile. They are double their original goal which would pay for a month. I'd imagine extending the time costs a lot less since they don't have to print out and put up a billboard. 

Nice to see the results of a gofundme.

1666 2018-06-25 20:20:48 Very good point ckr. The US government sends young men to die for oil rights and showboating FAR too often. The number of widows the US has purposefully produced is staggering. Hear hear!

1668 2018-06-25 20:20:43 Buhari: If I Owned An Oil Well When I was PTF Chairman, I Would Have Gone To Jail.
1669 2018-06-25 20:20:22 "As soon as they come out in their small pants and baby oil I'm getting the Vaseline out"  ....... no idea

1671 2018-06-25 20:20:20 Its not a must you to own oil well,you can still have trillions without owning that
1672 2018-06-25 20:20:19 It is not alright to make a woman cry. Eng. Comrade, you know this
1673 2018-06-25 20:20:11 Hell, yes. I believe in science. I believe fracking has caused earth quakes that ripple constantly across Oklahoma, destabilizing our infrastructure & homes. I believe the oil and gas industry is guilty of harming the world in a hundred ways and has no concern for Oklahoma.
1674 2018-06-25 20:20:09 DUDE WAS PROBABLY FU*KING SOME CHICK... AND USED ALL OF THAT AS SOME EXCUSE. CUZ HE KNEW FROM JUMP HE WAS NOT GONNA GET THE OLIVE OIL. PROBABLY DIDNT EVEN HAVE OLIVE OIL IN THE HOOD HE WAS IN. KNEW HE WOULD JUST SAME SOME B.S AND THEN GET ANGRY IF NEED BE TO GET OUT OF IT
1675 2018-06-25 20:19:24 In such situations the real issue is government and corruption, not a food issue itself. So, yes, oil nation can have a lack of food. On the contrary - Singapore has no oil and, in fact, it has nothing, but look how they live, what they have achieved.
1676 2018-06-25 20:19:23 I’m deaddd, I’m getting my oil changed & the guy calls me out for a chat in & he goes “your perfume smells really good, I’ve been smelling it since you walked in” 
1677 2018-06-25 20:19:23 The classic oil fire in a water trough is more fun, safer, and more instructive.

1688 2018-06-25 20:17:56 You know me and my man have been together for a while when I go get an oil change on my car and they put on the receipt my last name as Osadchuk.  I don’t remember us ever getting married

1694 2018-06-25 20:17:11 @DerekEllis10 I agree that Oil Kings must have looked at Lajoie. Still believe he's a sure-fire NHL coach one day -- said so often in the past -- if he chooses to go in that direction. He's a family guy first.

1702 2018-06-25 20:16:30 “Nestlé is committed to using 100% responsibly sourced palm oil by 2020.”

1706 2018-06-25 20:15:48 You guys are never gonna believe this but after being in the sun for hours with no sunscreen, in fact with coconut oil on to maximize my tan, I--a person with Moroccan origins--did in fact get sunburnt. I'm shocked !

1717 2018-06-25 20:15:07 Well I have a wealthy dad that works on the oil rigs does scaffolding on the oil rigs so calm down
1718 2018-06-25 20:15:04 Not really, mate. If you sell snake oil, your customers will shred you when they find out they’ve been had.
1719 2018-06-25 20:15:01 you forgot lifted trucks, trucks with the huge exhaust, or truck nuts.

1729 2018-06-25 20:14:06 Pipelines aren’t a set and forget thing. And they should be double contained. I can’t believe they don’t do double containment on new pipe. Pipes rust. Even carrying oil. Pipeline or train cars, Not enough people take their jobs seriously enough to prevent this shit
1730 2018-06-25 20:14:03 Ahhh, you meant from the show itself! In which case, black oil.
1731 2018-06-25 20:13:58 I’ve been using coconut oil shampoo and when I straighten my hair now it’s stiff and oily .. wtf do I do
1732 2018-06-25 20:13:55 ofc, that's why I said he should use neem oil, it's natural and organic
1733 2018-06-25 20:13:33 Yeah that sucks. The other Brent is not only younger, but like WAY richer: "Brent’s share of the global oil market doubled."
1734 2018-06-25 20:13:29 I would distinguish the deer as being essential to survival while the oil has a variable value  that only matters if you have survived to begin with.  It makes you rich or poor, not dead or alive - though others wanting it may change that status.
1735 2018-06-25 20:13:28 Hi I’m here for my first oil change.
“Okay an oil change?”
Yes..
*few minutes later*
“Is this your first time here for an oil change? I don’t see you in the system”

1736 2018-06-25 20:13:26 Basically the problem isn’t var. var is just exposing some v poor reffing. The Saudi one especially made me question how many oil barrels man had been offered.
1737 2018-06-25 20:13:01 Neil Young's plastic guitar pick is a petroleum product. He can't play Heart of Gold without the oil sands. #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1738 2018-06-25 20:12:58 Running through a wheat field will become a capital offence - it’ll be like setting fire to an oil refinery!
1739 2018-06-25 20:12:57 As an Albertan growing very tired of this governments inaction and poor treatment of the resource sector perhaps what we need is to have is the auto sector to go down in flames for them to realize just how important the oil sector is to our economy.
1740 2018-06-25 20:12:56 Lucky ass Portugal almost getting knocked da TF out by the oil wide leaders.
1741 2018-06-25 20:12:43 Non confrontational question: how has trump contributed to higher oil prices?
1742 2018-06-25 20:12:42 An Eastern companies train, operated by Easteners carrying ConcoPhilips Crude Oil bound for Cushing Oklahoma. This is @cathmckenna's fault. Also former President Obama's fault & any other climate pimps who doesn't like Pipelines!
1743 2018-06-25 20:12:41 You should see the downtown area where I live. It's row after row of homeless CBD oil addicts lining the street....
1744 2018-06-25 20:12:40 Broken down on highway for 3 hours.  Truck was low on oil. Guess who's not getting a good review, @BudgetTrucks
1745 2018-06-25 20:12:35 That's another classic. the west got rid of gadaf using cheap salafi brainwashed teenagers, secured the oil, and Libya went back to the stone age. What a disaster for Libya.
1746 2018-06-25 20:12:26 What does it mean short on the WTI cash-roll and it's paying a crazy record amount to get out  ?Does he think the oil will go down and  he taking a short on oil Can you explain what the positive and negative number means?

1748 2018-06-25 20:12:07 Sorry Melania. It's still throwing oil on a fire.
1749 2018-06-25 20:12:03 I don't like steamed. I prefer fried (usually in butter or ghee, but can also be coconut oil or whatever) and salted. Steamed veggies are bland AF.

1799 2018-06-25 20:05:39 Greece is well known for its peanut butter.

1810 2018-06-25 20:04:26 I think someone had a few to many drinks before writing that
1811 2018-06-25 20:04:19 Canada was in a recession no fault of Harper’s, so not sure about your “thriving” claim. Big oil and gas rolling in dough while all other sectors not.
1812 2018-06-25 20:04:11 Days like these make me wish I would’ve hoped on that oil boom so I’d get paid a bit more for sweating my butt off

1820 2018-06-25 20:03:21 And saturated fat doesn’t actually raise cholesterol! However, carbohydrates and rapeseed oil (aka Canada oil, aka canola oil) do actually cause many of the health problems blamed on saturated fats! 
1821 2018-06-25 20:02:57 I’ve been putting castor oil on my edges every night and I swear it be growing overnight

1825 2018-06-25 20:02:15 Well, there are so many lovely things to add, these days. Remember childhood cos lettuce, over-ripe toms and beetroot in vinegar. Harsh, but grilled artichoke in oil....who’d have imagined! Merlot...mmm, lovely.
1826 2018-06-25 20:02:08 We can justify our spending as we made it ourselves you can’t as it’s oil money
1827 2018-06-25 20:02:02 Milk n oil in cloth bag?
1828 2018-06-25 20:01:55 After President Trump jettisoned the Iran nuclear deal in May, a huge Indian energy company cut its oil imports from Iran virtually in half.
1829 2018-06-25 20:01:51 That how your dad lets you speak? Probs is seeing as hes at the oil rigs
1830 2018-06-25 20:01:22 Warning: Old lady on laptop! I was in a hurry too & I was trying to tell you what the @AP article was saying the FDA is doing with their own version of CBD oil
1831 2018-06-25 20:01:22 Yea I guess we shouldn’t use oil anymore after that BP oil spill huh: going on the lefts logic here( not easy) 
1832 2018-06-25 20:01:19 Brad Hollinbaugh. Unfortunately uses Synthol oil to inflate his muscles.
1833 2018-06-25 20:01:17 I will definitely be going here next oil change for sure!
1834 2018-06-25 20:01:12 hey @Subway what kind of oil is that?
1835 2018-06-25 20:01:03 I’m a millennial and I always tip 20% and I get the oil changed when the light comes on 
1836 2018-06-25 20:00:58 Where are we meeting to watch Nigeria’s game tomorrow?? And are we coming with our anointing oil?
1837 2018-06-25 20:00:42 And fish oil brings other bennies, too!
1838 2018-06-25 20:00:38 If we reach peak coffee before we reach peak oil...so help me God...

1848 2018-06-25 19:59:58 My one big fear - as a child of the late 60s & early 70s (and a red-head tendency) we were fried alive every summer, with the added help of “sun tan oil”! My kids were slathered in factor 50 all their lives, as I am now. Slip, slap, slop! Take care, sir. 
1849 2018-06-25 19:59:46 These Persians crying Nucleur Oil
1850 2018-06-25 19:59:38 @criticCitizen are you interested in being bearish oil up here?
1851 2018-06-25 19:59:34 We have been eating poison left, right and centre. Chips is fried using transformer oil,  Sugar laced with Mercury /Copper, Aflotixin riddled Maize, Cat meat Samosas. It is only by God's grace that we have made it this far as a nation.
1852 2018-06-25 19:59:23 ...and so I told my neighbor, if he pushes his lawnmower across my driveway and it leaks oil all over the driveway, that hes gonna go scrub it all off.
1853 2018-06-25 19:59:21 Dis Oil tycoons n Refs in cahootzzz!!!
1854 2018-06-25 19:59:19 Not really sure this is so hard to understand; pumping dirty carcinogenic chems into air/water/earth (Big Oil and Gas) vs not pumping chems into air/water/earth (#RenewableEnergy )
1855 2018-06-25 19:59:10 Surely the UN and most  of the west recognize only the Tripoli-based NOC. If oil goes through Bayda NOC then the GNA is finished. Maybe that is the idea.
1856 2018-06-25 19:59:02 My mom didn’t know if you tip mechanics so she asked the guy changing her oil if they get tips and how much they usually get 
1857 2018-06-25 19:59:01 I hate getting oil changes. I hate sitting for two hours doing nothing
1858 2018-06-25 19:58:49 And pipelines to move the oil safely from the fields to the refineries
1859 2018-06-25 19:58:47 You keep saying that, but you haven't presented anything to back up your claims. Do you work in the oil industry? Here's a fact. That pipeline was valued at 100 million. 4.5 billion is 9 times that. How does that make any sense?
1860 2018-06-25 19:58:42 Ladies: If you’re ever feeling not-so-fresh after your D appt., take a bath & add 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, some drops of tea tree & lavender oil, & some coconut oil. Don’t add soap. Spread your lips & feel your pH balance. It will also clean your tub!

1869 2018-06-25 19:57:39 Interesting theory.  You're proposing that someone from inside Monsanto took them out of the freezer and planted them on an oil rig access road as a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Canadian economy?
1870 2018-06-25 19:57:34 I'm not sure... Not mine or I'd still be trying to remove it and the oil would be all over the drive  @MrsBoilers' dad did it

1875 2018-06-25 19:56:48 Uhhhhhh?!? Read a few Keto books and you’ll find most of them recommend bullet proof coffee with grass fed organic butter and a couple drops of mct oil as an excellent source of some good fats and energy.
1876 2018-06-25 19:56:41 I think in the end Energy East would have been a better bet...we give oil to the US at a huge discount
1877 2018-06-25 19:56:33 Africa Is Dumping Ground For Manufacted Goods,Africa However House @at least 50 % Of World  Uranium’s and other radioactive minerals/Petroleum (Oil)That drive world economy/tariffs.African leaders are stupid and ignoramus .Africa must impose 60%taffifs On  Export Of it Minerals

Lied and con about being a healer (Yuan-ti oil salesman), until the god whose name he called in vain, a trickery god, decided to make a honest man out of him and made him its envoy on the land. Forced to help.
1879 2018-06-25 19:56:27 Portugal could have been promised a discounted oil deal....
Use your faculty...
1880 2018-06-25 19:56:16 I think more oil comes off dinner plates/pans in the wash than the pea sized bit of coconut oil twice a day but you could totally compost it. #ethicalhour
1881 2018-06-25 19:56:11 Oh gawd that sh*t was gross af.

Some of yall h*es need Jesus, the cross, the church, the preacher, the holy water/holy oil, and whole bible- ALL VERSIONS OF IT. 

I AM STILL DRY HEAVING
1882 2018-06-25 19:56:02 Ugandans with good customer care have a special share in the country's oil 
1883 2018-06-25 19:55:52 Has someone discovered oil in Zimbabwe?
1884 2018-06-25 19:55:50 As if a guy on eBay won’t buy my clothes because i refuse to cover myself in baby oil and send him photos, not for £1.50 hun x
1885 2018-06-25 19:55:49 Your are right and these old dinosaurs reps need to go to oil soon. They cause more chaos than is most certainly needed in trying to come up some crap to point another finger at Trump. This is getting real damn old.
1886 2018-06-25 19:55:47 Try coconut oil 
1887 2018-06-25 19:55:37 It's a Chinese company, not the US oil company.
1888 2018-06-25 19:55:31 Vegetable oil renders it definitely not the best
1889 2018-06-25 19:55:25 I truly appreciate soccer and the athletes.  And I just got a 20 min nap while getting oil changed
1890 2018-06-25 19:55:19 Is this actually verified or is someone trying to create trouble. According to a UN resolution only the Trpoli-based NOC under Sanalla is the sole legitimate dealer in LIbyan oil. The eastern NOC would be a parallel institution which no one should deal with.
1891 2018-06-25 19:55:07 LOL! tRUMP is DEMANDING oil prices be reduced? LOL! OMG LOL!! HES SUCH A SFI!
1892 2018-06-25 19:55:05 Anas needs to investigate the referee in this match (IRAN-POR). They probably promised him some oil money lol
1893 2018-06-25 19:54:56 I think Portugal’s oil prices are about to go up @thelivesoccer_  #PortugalVIran #WorldCupRussia2018 @jackwhitehall #oilprices
1894 2018-06-25 19:54:21 CDB Oil does not get you - or animals - high. It's the medical part of the plant that has proven to be effective for treating anxiety, depression, pain, etc. I'm not defending her. Just stating facts about the treats.
1895 2018-06-25 19:54:17 I think some oil money has been fished out here , absolute disgrace
1896 2018-06-25 19:54:15 So today I got coconut oil over mums patio which has now stained and cost her an absolute fortune and basically I need to find myself a new home, asking for a mate x
1897 2018-06-25 19:54:15 Consequences.
1898 2018-06-25 19:54:06 US produces ~10.6 mln bpd of oil and uses ~16.5 mln bpd of oil. Top suppliers: Canada, Saudi, Iraq. Your assertion is incorrect.
1899 2018-06-25 19:54:03 Such a good point! Products like balms and coconut oil can be used for so many things!
1900 2018-06-25 19:53:57 I love the smell of gun oil.
1901 2018-06-25 19:53:57 I don't like this drinking game
1902 2018-06-25 19:53:57 I'd put some oil on it.
1903 2018-06-25 19:53:49 The dear thing is the classic example but yeah this issue has serious real world ramifications like in the India example. There's also things like how oil is excavated in Saudi Arabia. Largely from a Shia majority area by Sunni land owners and to the detriment of that Shia pop.
1904 2018-06-25 19:53:46 The lengths people will go to get a free oil change ...there must be 30 + cars in line waiting at the new place in Germantown. @Take5_OilChange
1905 2018-06-25 19:53:32 Trash and fish in our oceans lets our part!  Trash and oil, fishing lines. And net.
1906 2018-06-25 19:53:16 A sad and sorry state. Despite being an oil rich country.
1907 2018-06-25 19:52:41 Beautiful Voice! What do the lyrics actually say? Absurd though that it is the car that is invested with the myth of freedom - once more. Cars are causing a vast amount of our problems, not least the oil dependence...

1911 2018-06-25 19:51:45 So interesting - I’d like to hear more. I’m not a big fan of dogma & maybe I’m too dogmatic about this. But I hate the many of the companies that make this stuff so much: palm oil, exploiting children, monoculture farming etc so I don’t mind putting people off a bit!
1912 2018-06-25 19:51:39 I knew! Do you have any tea tree or witch hazel oil?
1913 2018-06-25 19:51:37 US expects to overtake Russia & Saudi Arabia as largest producer of crude oil and that’s energy we’d like to share with you says @SecretaryPerry. We export with no strings attached. Coercion or threatening sovereignty with energy is not our way.   #ACEnergy

1919 2018-06-25 19:50:49 I didn't claim it did. export income collapsed because of the oil price collapse. obviously if trade impacts the exchange rate its the net position that matters...

but also, we're talking about an institutional structure that fell apart.

1921 2018-06-25 19:50:41 Regarding the Iowa derailment could CBC enlighten us in their tweet headline as to who’s train & tracks. Your headline should indicate that the Alberta oil inside was not the cause. The track was the cause, as was the Railroad Company. 
Both US owned. 
Another CBC hidden agenda?
1922 2018-06-25 19:50:39 HOW ELSE WILL THEY MAKE BABY OIL?!?!?
1923 2018-06-25 19:50:34 Haven't been to the movie theatres in over 20 years for that exact reason. Redbox has them for 1.50 and I can watch it more than once.
1924 2018-06-25 19:50:34 And yet FN’s in Washington state are planning on protesting the CDN oil sector when their own President is doing much more to encourage tanker traffic than we are. Seems to me that they have some issues in their own backyard....
1925 2018-06-25 19:50:09 I like that apparently the marketing photo of Saudi Arabian women being allowed to vote involves a @Tesla . Their whole economy is based on oil why would they want that image ?
1926 2018-06-25 19:50:06 Oh okay that’s what I thought doctors appointment. Eww they are gross now they don’t make them bomb no more and we need fresh oil lol
1927 2018-06-25 19:49:46 We use coconut oil in deodorant,moisturiser, hair conditioner and I’ve been tooth pulling for a couple of years, my oral health is vastly improved even my dentist has noticed a big improvement #EthicalHour
1928 2018-06-25 19:49:43 Anyone have tips for stretch marks? I heard coconut oil works wonders but I haven’t met anyone who has used it 
1929 2018-06-25 19:49:36 My day "off":

Fasting bloodwork (which meant no coffee first thing)

Dentist for me and 9yo- over 2 hours (which I avoid like the plague bc they want thousands of dollars to fix my teeth)

Oil change

Car wash

Groceries

Pharmacy

This is unacceptable use of vacation days.

1931 2018-06-25 19:49:28 Eco-fascists and complicit leftist libtard commies #MSM and politicos oppose pipeline not because they want it to be shipped on trains and boats but because they oppose oil period. Unfortunately for them and us, their choice imposed on us leads to disasters such as this one.
1932 2018-06-25 19:49:26 The day desi auntys stop putting oil in their salan (curry) is the day asian twitter will be at peace.
1933 2018-06-25 19:49:18 Investment advisors telling pension funds that the value of oil stocks, and traditional energy companies that depend on oil, face a price collapse in about 10-15 years and need to divest. The value of oil in the ground isn't going to be worth currently market valuations.

1936 2018-06-25 19:48:57 Walked up to a man wearing an "I oil my gun with liberal tears" tshirt, stuck out my hand, said "Hi, I'm Susanna, I'm from New York, I voted for Hillary Clinton & I just want to make sure we keep talking to each other as Americans. What's important to you?" He said "Freedom." +

1939 2018-06-25 19:48:16 And #cbd oil stopped 3 seizures my dog had last week in seconds. I owe her life to CBD oils. Applied 40mg to gums for 1 min 3x/day and she's fine.

1947 2018-06-25 19:47:05 S/o @lucaspage__ for that free oil change
1948 2018-06-25 19:46:59 I need to get a oil change imma go in the morning
1949 2018-06-25 19:46:52 That's not what I'm saying at all. The original post is about a politician trying to hurt a small business. Will, off-topically, brought up--incorrectly --a lawsuit regarding birth control and religion. None of these things has anything to do with the other. Thanks for playing.
1950 2018-06-25 19:46:46 He is a helluva player, and this year's "bright white sports car". Stamkos  last year, potentially Karlsson next year. I think we see this every year now as a way for the marquee player to maximize contract value. It only takes 1 or 2 to re-sign with old team to keep hope alive
1951 2018-06-25 19:46:19 whoever told me to shave your legs with coconut oil: ya moms a hoe 
1952 2018-06-25 19:46:13 I'd think it's the fat molecules. Basically the same effect as oil on a road etc. #foodunwrapped
1953 2018-06-25 19:46:10 #UKOG #HORSEHILL In the Race for the Weald Basin Oil.  The #GatwickGusher is quick off the block and out of the Stalls! Viva UKOG!
1954 2018-06-25 19:46:04 But... but... big pharma, oil and auto, and banks have feelings too!
1955 2018-06-25 19:45:53 Godamn electric fence was on, I didn’t know, tapped when I was getting up the gas and oil cans...about dropped from it
1956 2018-06-25 19:45:38 Then why is that we are still importing so much oil ??
1957 2018-06-25 19:45:25 Lesson children - don’t lie in the sun for hours with olive oil on. Crispy bacon 
1958 2018-06-25 19:45:18 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1959 2018-06-25 19:45:13 And coconut oil it works for me
1960 2018-06-25 19:45:13 The people who are civil are the ones who voted for Donald Trump - whose campaign was civil and whose personality is civil. LOL
1961 2018-06-25 19:45:04 For elderly who take prescription opioids, I condone medical MJ oil ingested. Have seen improvement first hand while not taking the analgesic. Pain relief lasts for days versus hours.

Only finding benefits now after 100 years of prohibition. Kids, get lost..
1962 2018-06-25 19:45:01 You're being played, our republic is constantly at war conquering nations to rob their natural resources, Mainly oil and natural gas.
1963 2018-06-25 19:44:56 That’s why every time I cook bacon I save the grease into a coffee cup.  Then I’ll mix it up with cooking with that, olive oil, and butter.
1964 2018-06-25 19:44:54 May I rub oil on you? Massage you? A nice cold refreshment?
1965 2018-06-25 19:44:51 I like a salad. Leaves chopped finely to boost the polyphenol level, lots of other bits, drizzle of oil, scattered hemp seeds.......beautiful. Mind you, admit to liking mayo. Not on me shirt mind!
1966 2018-06-25 19:44:51 Currently enjoying the posh bath oil @cumbersketching encouraged me to buy. That was a good decision! 
1967 2018-06-25 19:44:46 How can a country rich in oil and many other resources of 180 million population have more poor people than a country of 1 billion population. #ThisIsNigeria has failed, all the leaders  have failed .
1968 2018-06-25 19:44:37 They intervened to serve their own interests and caused utter devastation. 1 million dead Iraq, Libya is jihadist slave state number of dead unknown, US occupy 30% of Syria which has the oil & gas, are supporting arming financing jihadist extremists against popular elected gov
1969 2018-06-25 19:44:33 Do not wanna go get this lil oil change 
1970 2018-06-25 19:44:22 Laughable
1971 2018-06-25 19:44:14 So I've been writing a report on crypto currencies... and it's been one of the wierdest research experiences of my life.

It is all snake oil!
1972 2018-06-25 19:44:06 Not oil, jews.
1973 2018-06-25 19:44:04 Birthday happiness:
Glass of Lagavulin Single Malt Whiskey, big fat Corona cigar, cup of coffee, smell of honing oil and the sound of my new knife sharpening stones honing my blades. So now I'm horny as F*ck :p #knifenerd #birthday #horny #gimme
1974 2018-06-25 19:43:53 Trump is now demanding the price of oil to go down due to the sharp rise in gas prices. Classic Trump,  no concept of how things work in the real world's global market.
1975 2018-06-25 19:43:45 Get your mankini on Graham! And some tanning oil
1976 2018-06-25 19:43:26 @carmichaeltimo1  it seems our oil leak from gearbox has finally been cured, I've just checked level plug and not a drop has been used on a 50 miler yesterday, so top marks sir we did it 
1977 2018-06-25 19:43:23 Pack them with salt and leave for a week, then cover with lime juice, more salt and olive oil, pop in a couple of chillies and leave for a month.
1978 2018-06-25 19:43:23 Yes I love tincture. My aunt has fibromyalgia, migraines and a lot of other health issues and cbd oil in tincture form has helped her out a lot. As for migraines for myself it only works when I take it right at the peak of it.
1979 2018-06-25 19:43:21 The high price of oil is the best gift Trump could've given Putin.  The oil- based Russian economy has received an enormous infusion of cash, probably hundreds of billions of dollars, since they installed Trump.
1980 2018-06-25 19:43:19 @JessicaTarlov is too busy attacking conservative women like @RealCandaceO to reply to common sense questions.
1981 2018-06-25 19:43:18 When we listen to Wild Wild West we feel and understand every single lyric. Its not a song or even commentary. It is our life. We dont even call each other anymore when there is another uprising because we know there will be another and another. We have no oil. Only people.
1982 2018-06-25 19:43:16 @MSNBCRachel  Will you PLEASE research and comment on how many members of Congress/Senate are heavily invested in Russian oil. Public NEEDS TO KNOW this is why Congress is letting Trump get away with murder!!
1983 2018-06-25 19:43:13 Saudi and the rest have oil reserves into 2100. Yes they can lower prices. Price fixing all the time as they corner the markets. Higher in summer and lower in winter. Are they mad at USA? That will cause a rise in price. Price fixing. Happens in the States as well.
1984 2018-06-25 19:43:11 I can see the video now... oil vs edibles haha
1985 2018-06-25 19:43:10 uneducated ppl and me is like oil and water, we dont mix
1986 2018-06-25 19:42:55 you got me at oil
1987 2018-06-25 19:42:51 OMG!  .@realDonaldTrump has gone begging on his knees to #OPEC pleading for them to lower oil prices!  He is SHAMING OUR COUNTRY!!!
1988 2018-06-25 19:42:46 Ok, but what’s the point of making an appointment to get my oil changed if I still have to wait for two hours??
1989 2018-06-25 19:42:44 not mine, but even without the bicarb the coconut oil works as a deodorant. #ethicalhour
1990 2018-06-25 19:42:35 I think it started with Cars 2 being a woke diatribe against Big Oil a few years back.  So bad.
1991 2018-06-25 19:42:34 He rejected oil money from qarabaq
1992 2018-06-25 19:42:31 I will only go to the Westerville or Polaris Valvoline for an oil change. Those are my guys! 
1993 2018-06-25 19:42:16 Lol I went to the car wash today, so that when I get an oil change, the people don’t see all the mess in my car. I forgot the dealership gives me a complimentary car wash when I get an oil change Dx
1994 2018-06-25 19:42:00 #FLINT #POLICE

HAZARD: EB69 & 475, oil covering the entire left lane
1995 2018-06-25 19:41:59 While others are working with the hope of future promises (and snake oil forklift upgrades), I’m talking Passpoint, data driven automation, and dynamic segmentation using already released tech from @ArubaNetworks. Absolutely fantastic meetings today with @airheadone
1996 2018-06-25 19:41:56 Under Trudeau unemployment 21 year low...
GDP 15 year high..
All while oil never above $70
1997 2018-06-25 19:41:50 How do the regulations re CBD oil differ in different countries?  #AcupunctureHour
1998 2018-06-25 19:41:48 I agree. Keep goverment out of the private sector. There is no shortage of oil.
1999 2018-06-25 19:41:33 Tray-baked chicken thighs and new potatoes with crushed garlic and olive oil, served with steamed greens from the frozen section of the kitchen! Delicious. #foodonabudget #moneysaving #budget #feedsfour #frugalliving #moneysavingtip
2000 2018-06-25 19:41:22 The division is there, just the LNA never stepped up for the East to push back against all these West attempts to take for control which what the five past years were about.
The west is feeding militias that attacked the oil so the war is upon us whichever way we go.
2001 2018-06-25 19:41:19 Peppermint oil is the best 
2002 2018-06-25 19:41:13 Now you know everything about football, trust me
2003 2018-06-25 19:41:07 Put some olive oil on, for intensive hydration, after my shower. 

Now I just smell like a giant salad. 
#FML
2004 2018-06-25 19:41:05 So the family contributes nothing towards building our economy?? So his oil and cement is also contraband...lets aviod blanket condemnation.
2005 2018-06-25 19:41:05 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2006 2018-06-25 19:41:02 200 hour ma at Brent has evolved to trench in World War 1 from a line in the sand.WTI don't gives a shit as it slowly corrects the monster brent-wti spread. #OOTT I had entered to a short position at the last minute as BEI didn't even move even oil was up 4%.
2007 2018-06-25 19:41:02 I’m at work and I had to show one of the coworkers an item on my phone and I opened this and they where like dang it mak that’s not coconut oil 
2008 2018-06-25 19:41:01 Unfortunately it didn’t do much for me. Could have been the quantity/form I was taking, though. I ate cbd gummies daily just to test it out and see and it really didn’t make a noticeable difference. I’d like to try oil though. Apparently it’s better w/thc 4 entourage effect
2009 2018-06-25 19:41:01 My local place is great & they’ve all got interesting cars or projects on the go. Always interesting classics etc in there for fettling or MOTs etc which says a lot. Just had 6 month peace of mind oil change done on the Merc there & they made sure they used oem spec filter & oil
2010 2018-06-25 19:40:53 Coconut oil is amazing as a beauty product - cleanser, body moisturiser and conditioner #ethicalhour
2011 2018-06-25 19:40:52 Perfume I use essential oils or Neals Yard, conditioner coconut oil is good, hair die.... I’m still looking but henna sometimes #EthicalHour
2012 2018-06-25 19:40:50 Yep, that's exactly what they meant.
You hit the nail on the head.
There was no way they were talking about the systems white people made to opress other.

Nope.

They were talking about medicine.
2013 2018-06-25 19:40:49 yeah but ours are olive oil which is infinitely better than sunflower
2014 2018-06-25 19:40:44 Dislike olives, I've no use for them any food. And grapeseed oil Superior to Olive Oil
2015 2018-06-25 19:40:34 Should be more than just power oil oo anyways it Nigeria 2
Argentina 0
2016 2018-06-25 19:40:29 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
2017 2018-06-25 19:40:28 Fun fact: organic coconut oil is a far cheaper, cleaner alternative to synthetic lotion formulas and it's generally just as effective.
2018 2018-06-25 19:40:27 What's your favorite type of painting? Oil, watercolor, etc?
2019 2018-06-25 19:40:27 Either way this is human lives we are dealing with compared to cows. Two wrongs don't make a right.

2021 2018-06-25 19:40:16 So now the US now has a centralized economy & that the executive can dictate oil prices? Good to know.

2024 2018-06-25 19:39:58 The GOP would turn Yellowstone into an oil refinery.
2025 2018-06-25 19:39:52 That's not how it works.  You can't just demand the oil prices be cut.  And he claims to be a business man.  Trump's an imbecile.
2026 2018-06-25 19:39:50 Or story is a good one!

I left a job in Georgia because my father had a heart attack and was in ND. I got a job on the oil fields. I constantly was changing trucks and Job site so my cell phone chargers kept fraying and breaking.
2027 2018-06-25 19:39:38 Nymex crude oil traders... search the hole World  who has given this types 99%  accuracy calls. ....With live performance. ....think cool mind i have given  24 calls pft given 23 calls and sl hit only 1 call....  and total pft given... 16,600  U.S Dollars...
2028 2018-06-25 19:39:06 Coconut oil is an absolute godsend
2029 2018-06-25 19:39:01 Nadia ... have you ever heard of the healing powers of cannabis oil ? ... I strongly suggest you read up on it .... i know someone that started taking it for fibro and they haven't had a flare up since .
2030 2018-06-25 19:38:56 #amateurartmistake no. 1: The pouring method in oil should involve adding more linseed oil to your paint. All you will get is a pretty, sticky mess that never dries. I tried Acrylic with a pouring medium and it is just easier and not sticky and dries in a few hrs..
2031 2018-06-25 19:38:45 Hopefully you'll talk about how leaving the Iran deal made oil prices jump
2032 2018-06-25 19:38:41 What's with the demanding @AliVelshi ?

Does Trump even understand supply and demand, oil cartels and speculators?
2033 2018-06-25 19:38:38 Meanwhile in a couple of tbsps of olive oil gently cook the cubed pancetta (50-100g) until crisp and turn off heat. Add spaghetti to pan with pancetta and mix well. Once cooled a little, add the egg mixture and mix well. Job done.
2034 2018-06-25 19:38:34 Ask me how you can get healthy without toxic prescription and over the counter drugs! 100% legal and 100% pure cbd oil! #nochemicals #healthy #cbdoil
2035 2018-06-25 19:38:33 estoy usando un labial a bolita dice lip oil, a parte de que no se me secan los labios me deja alta jeta de petera.
2036 2018-06-25 19:38:32 I'd try with neem oil ;)
2037 2018-06-25 19:38:32 It’s great that the Edmond Volkswagen dealership is located directly beside the Mercedes Benz dealership.  Really enjoyed staring out at a row of G Wagons while I was waiting on my Jetta’s oil to get changed.
2038 2018-06-25 19:38:28 Little oil never hurt anyone 
2039 2018-06-25 19:38:20 Just hide them from seeing your posts lol I have to do it with Josh about oil field posts 
2040 2018-06-25 19:38:13 The issue is that most countries that depend on crude oil proceeds to fund their budget like NIGERIA and Angola will be in trouble...
2041 2018-06-25 19:38:10 Really? Surely that will create a huge conflict with the NOC in Tripoli which is the recognized monopoly internationally. Who would buy oil from the eastern NOC? Any ship that tries to do so could be seized as has happened before.
2042 2018-06-25 19:38:10 Snake Oil,
KIRSTJEN NIELSON!
2043 2018-06-25 19:38:08 Buy oil drillers #Amer is drilling for oil 
2044 2018-06-25 19:37:59 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
2045 2018-06-25 19:37:53 LNA decision not to hand over #Libya’s key oil exporting terminals to NOC in Tripoli is dangerous. Could re-ignite war and deepen East vs West divide.
2046 2018-06-25 19:37:50 Know I have too get a oil change 
2047 2018-06-25 19:37:37 Because that's what Sponsored studies are all about. One example iis Sydney Diet heart study where non conforming data was junked in a garage as they had to keep the PUFA oil industry happy.
2048 2018-06-25 19:37:22 Best to avoid York Ave and take an alternative, its full of fresh oil, take Indiana and Windsor to York to Reservoir Rd. The North part of York doesn't have fresh oil yet!
2049 2018-06-25 19:37:20 I love coconut oil as well. Wouldn’t switch back from it now as a cleanser, deep conditioner and body moisturiser #ethicalhour
2050 2018-06-25 19:37:11 Same could be said for uk government before the indy ref. What was it they said there was only 20 years of oil left and then after there was 140 years. So lies there. Plus i don't want my oil money going to a murderous peado government that drags us scots into illegal wars.
2051 2018-06-25 19:37:04 I used to love love love #TheBodyShop carrot moisturiser. But they discontinued it :( Now I use #coconut #oil but would love a similar #ethical carrot moisturiser all the same! Anyone know one #ethicalhour?
2052 2018-06-25 19:37:01 We are going to need high taxes to cover those costs. Oil companies aren't going to do it no matter how many promises they make to clean it up. They'll be long gone by then and will cry poor. Yet folks are bitching about gas prices and carbon taxes!
2053 2018-06-25 19:36:22 more funny because Pioneer (& others) say they'll be cutting back on production in Texas, at least in near term. But really, should we expect the government to express a nuanced understanding of the global oil market & the role of US production in that market on twitter?
2054 2018-06-25 19:36:14 The key thing is that protectionism "in the interests of the workers" is snake oil: you put up barriers to goods from China or India or anywhere else -- and the workers elsewhere suffer.
2055 2018-06-25 19:36:13 You have to remember that Social Justice Worrying and logic don't mix. Oil and water come to mind and they are like heavy crude Vs Perrier.
2056 2018-06-25 19:35:59 I know, since the price of oil is rising, let's liquidate the SPR.
2057 2018-06-25 19:35:46 Do not abort. Keep that flirting going get ya oil changed fa freeeeee everytime lmao
2058 2018-06-25 19:35:39 Give her some oil. It’ll honestly make such a big difference for the way she feels
2059 2018-06-25 19:35:32 niko says we need to bathe in salt and lavender so like im thinking we all get together ingame, have our characters in a hot tub, throw away some table salt & lavender oil and 'bathe' together
2060 2018-06-25 19:35:31 i’ve been sitting at this repair shop for almost 3 hours now and i literally only came here to get my oil changed.. I JUST GOT OFF WORK B IM TRYINA GO NAP!!
2061 2018-06-25 19:35:31 From Televangelist to Snake Oil pusher.  Isn't it supposed to be the other way around.
2062 2018-06-25 19:35:14 Coconut oil is an amazing cleanser. Put it on and put a hot cloth over your face, steam for 30 secs and gently wipe off #ethicalhour
2063 2018-06-25 19:35:14 “Living poor creates chaos, spills oil on important papers, forgets to sign permission slips, and robs you of the road to knowledge, which is the worst thing. Well, maybe the worst thing is having to leave your own life to get anywhere, and no matter what, you miss your people.”

2065 2018-06-25 19:35:11 She got two flat tires sitting on her chest looking like she’s waiting for a routine oil change and tire rotation.
2066 2018-06-25 19:35:00 I love my car so much but I hate anytime something is wrong with it they have to take the whole engine apart to get to anything. It should not be $800 to fix an oil leak but here we are 
2067 2018-06-25 19:34:57 I am getting my oil changed and used the bathroom to wash my hands.  Their soap smelled like fruit and had exfoliating beads.

My hands feel so smooth.  5 stars on Yelp.
2068 2018-06-25 19:34:46 Anyone buying something from you deserves the snake oil you peddle, #christianhypocrite
2069 2018-06-25 19:34:27 If you stopped shaving until the  irritationclears up, consider applying tree oil or  aftershave products  made with tree oil to treat the surface of your  skin.
2070 2018-06-25 19:34:03 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming
2071 2018-06-25 19:34:03 Mine is pretty good. I use coconut oil as a cleanser and conditioner, solid bar shampoo and deodorant. The main fail is my plastic pot for my moisturiser and my mascara #ethicalhour
2072 2018-06-25 19:33:43 i just spent several minutes rubbing oil on my cat how’s your night going
2073 2018-06-25 19:33:26 Just made my own flaxseed gel, found some PURE Jamaican castor oil today for my hair, made my own deep conditioner. About to wash and condition. Good wash day.
2074 2018-06-25 19:33:20 It’s clear you’re just against oil, just like Greenpeace because it’s easy prey. You don’t seem to care about the thousands of other large ships that will be coming and no one is protesting them. You’re just being a shill for GP!
2075 2018-06-25 19:33:20 I'm surprised @JillFilipovic hasn't poured boiling oil from the battlements to repel the intruder.
2076 2018-06-25 19:33:18 YEP. I'll get onto Ciampa and order a few cases of baby oil for, er, some Irish guy.
2077 2018-06-25 19:33:17 That's gonna leave a mark
2078 2018-06-25 19:33:14 Wuz it an oil based marinade, or more like a BBQ? 
2079 2018-06-25 19:33:11 I just finished reading instructions on how to use  nut oil on the hard wood and now...I think I'll read it again. @MurderSmall
2080 2018-06-25 19:33:09 No, it’s because he’s an oil well himself.

Corn flour, starch, oil, syrup, dextrose, dextrin, maltodextrin... etc. If you're going to be allergic to something, make simple like eggs. Or milk. Or gluten. Or all 3. Not corn!  #RantOver
2084 2018-06-25 19:32:52 And to take it a step further, how about when the time comes where #xrp settles in oil.

2087 2018-06-25 19:32:12 wish I could get a shinee scented essential oil so I could put it in a vaporiser and they could soothe my lungs as well as my heart
2088 2018-06-25 19:32:07 Fish oil! That would probably work... Ita usually very mild constipation so it shouldn't take much. It's just, any time he skips 2 meals in a row I know he's not feeling so good. We'll try tonight & see how he "goes"
2089 2018-06-25 19:32:04 Sooo Spidey falling in a pool of Motor Oil has something to do with the plot.    Marvel has blown my mind again. Cant wait!

2091 2018-06-25 19:31:57 Mine can use dry herb or oil/concentrate. Which helps a lot.
2092 2018-06-25 19:31:52 We need the oil producing nations and the oil using nations that were benefited by U.S. protection of the oil flows to pony up the money to keep the protection or we should pull back and renegotiate our trade deals. 
2093 2018-06-25 19:31:47 getting my oil changed at jiffy lube and this people fucking talk as jiffy as they change the oil #CantKeepUp #Wut
2094 2018-06-25 19:31:37 Best to avoid York Ave its fresh oil, take an alternative like Indiana to get to Reservoir Rd and pay water.
2095 2018-06-25 19:31:33 didnt this government "save" 12billion *every year* by taking it from welfare and the disabled? and they gave oil a 60billion tax break...but this isnt affordable

2101 2018-06-25 19:31:04 So, after a battery fiasco during our travels yesterday, took the car to @Walmart in Port Charlotte today to get the oil changed and the battery replaced. I first arrived around noon and was told that it would be approximately a half hour for my service. Now, here it is
2102 2018-06-25 19:31:01 I feel you, try cbd oil I promise it helps x
2103 2018-06-25 19:30:53 Teri jaan meri jaan is for the people of Pakistan not for the rulers of Pakistan who, just like the price of oil, change the rhetoric on Kashmir. The ruler elite of Pakistan r the real soul sellers.
2104 2018-06-25 19:30:52 Cabinet sat today Chaired by H.E @KagutaMuseveni .Key among its decisions was the passing of the #LocalContent Policy for Oil & Gas sector, reserving supply of a range of goods &services for local entities. Details tomorrow at #CabinetPressbriefing @UgandaMediaCent @OfwonoOpondo
2105 2018-06-25 19:30:51 Yes he did
2106 2018-06-25 19:30:46 rose water and sweet almond oil are the plug
2107 2018-06-25 19:30:25 Also, keep in mind they can buy gold from CH and UK in USD, then convert to CNY for oil. Internally, they probably value gold at 10x+ current price and USD at 1/10th:) That means relatively very small fluctuations (devel) in Yuan are immaterial in gold acquisition strategy.
2108 2018-06-25 19:30:19 I hate waiting for my oil change. I'm gonna learn to do it myself because ugh
2109 2018-06-25 19:30:16 In Shampoo and Moisturiser Ads, "Essential Oils" means that the oil gives off a distinctive scent, not that they're essential.

2114 2018-06-25 19:29:51 You should tell your lad to stop wanking into your coconut oil
2115 2018-06-25 19:29:47 Sure, BUT why should we send money to a province (Quebec) which is sitting on natural resources and simply refuses to develop them? I am not OK sending my “dirty Albert oil” money to Quebec to pay for cheap daycare while they refuse to help themselves. Why are you?
2116 2018-06-25 19:29:35 We had success w/ marrow, peanut butter w/extra peanut oil, mixing in fish oil,

Let them eat up (oil up), rest 15 min, then drink up, then walk time

Some times, we'd give milk (almost straight from vows)

Relatives succeded w/pumpkin, and cod liver oil

Warm baths worked, too
2117 2018-06-25 19:29:27 i pray she finds better friends and coconut oil.

2119 2018-06-25 19:29:15 I forgot that I had kandi in my car and the guy doing my oil change asked me if I was going to audiotistic. I awkwardly said yeah as I looked at him hella creeped out 
2120 2018-06-25 19:29:10 That’s interesting... what ratio butter and oil.

2126 2018-06-25 19:28:15 The Tories are slaves to the fossil fuel lobby. This was quite deliberate and cynical in its' intent.  It's the same interests that drove brexit, whether you voted leave or stay matters not a jot. I'm sure most didn't vote for some oil company to run our energy policy.
2127 2018-06-25 19:28:14 I’m a total car guy now. I know everything there is to know about engines, mufflers, oil, and, of course, tires. I love sliding underneath cars to look at all the parts. Mmmmm just thinking about those sweet sweet cars gets me all jazzed up!
2128 2018-06-25 19:28:04 Oil attack wasn’t that against jedran which haftar done the exact same thing just 2-3 days ago or is one bad and the other good ?
2129 2018-06-25 19:28:00 Just started my first theater shift and those minions have me in a room making popcorn. If you people only knew about the butter. The quantity, the calories, the consistency!

2132 2018-06-25 19:27:30 My mom was so against CBD oil but she’s seeing it’s helping me feel better and she’s just happy af now. Still doesn’t like the idea of it but as long as I’m being me again- she is over the moon

2136 2018-06-25 19:27:09 Last I heard we were selling them off.. and then the oil prices rose.. 

That was the last omnibus.

2143 2018-06-25 19:26:05 look at them moisturized curls! I bet he smelled like coconut oil 
2144 2018-06-25 19:25:58 Awww dok. Hug. RE oily, oil film? Primer? Moisturizer?
2145 2018-06-25 19:25:44 It’s a grocery store.  You get all types from oil tycoons to your day worker.
2146 2018-06-25 19:25:43 Upcoming videos: Saturday’s Day with DeeO, strictly laps with litpro data, oil change on Ol’Redki, follow up on LitPro about how I get the data over the video.
2147 2018-06-25 19:25:22 One of my friends actually just started using CBD oil and said he’s noticed an exceptional difference! Makes me wonder if I should try it myself 
2148 2018-06-25 19:25:12 LT:Mother just called me to say one of her friends went for a trip to Egypt and bought 20 litres of olive oil. And now that lady has the olive oil in a jerican in her sitting room for all to see

2151 2018-06-25 19:24:37 Ohh it would take far more than whatever characters Twitter allows!  Goes way, way back. And then there is Benghazi Battle, Derna, and now the Oil Crescent attack, plus Brak al-Shati massacre, and on and on and on.  Why does Misrata get all the port money from Cyrenaica/Barqah?
2152 2018-06-25 19:24:36 good question #ethicalhour #coconut #oil #fatbergs?
2153 2018-06-25 19:24:29 So are you actively reducing palm oil usage? What's your target for elimination? Mine is to never purchase products containing palm oil.
2154 2018-06-25 19:24:23 The only good thing that is olive related is olive oil, otherwise I'd eradicate the tree from the earth.
2155 2018-06-25 19:24:14 this every time i go get a oil change 
2156 2018-06-25 19:24:05 Chop one hundred handfuls of olive oil and stir vigorously.
2157 2018-06-25 19:23:43 Yes, if you didn't know the United States DOES export the oil it produces. In addition our government stockpiles a  federal reserve of oil  to sustain our Country for one year; buying when oil at  it's bottom low. Just like gas station owners do.
2158 2018-06-25 19:23:40 soome pet stores can carry CBD tinctures with coconut oil, but usually you have to personally ask for them to bring it in for you!

2162 2018-06-25 19:23:21 The 'Little Sisters’ case was on hold because the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the lower court rulings against them. The COURTS not @BarackObama. Why don't u people understand how things work? That's just dumb.
2163 2018-06-25 19:23:19 Thank you coconut oil and water for keeping my skin looking only 20 
2164 2018-06-25 19:23:10 Meanwhile you rip up rain forests for palm oil, stevia etc. etc. Underwhelmed by the company that sued 4 woman who pointed out that aggressive advertising in poor countries promoting baby formula was killing babies. You remain what you were.
2165 2018-06-25 19:23:06 They say its not halal because they use the same vats to filter the oil. So when they clean oil and reuse it, the same oil that was use for chicken gets filtered in the same vat that is then filtered for fries and fish.
2166 2018-06-25 19:22:55 1. Decent folk are still in awe after witnessing (perhaps for the 1st time) naked evil paraded in public. This is not an oddity. People hang out with like-minded people. Like oil and water, good and evil can never mix. AND no matter how much we stir the two, they won't change.
2167 2018-06-25 19:22:44 I love how people think the answer is” Manipulate prices of everything including oil to be so expensive that everybody has to switch to something else” ...... lunacy !!!! Absolute lunacy !
2168 2018-06-25 19:22:39 I hear this mentioned so often to treat so many different medical conditions and the cbd oil,that I do personally agree with ... 
2169 2018-06-25 19:22:26 I use plain coconut oil - zero dental issues since I started using it - and no sensitivity now either. #ethicalhour

2171 2018-06-25 19:22:18 Stuck waiting for an oil change...good thing the waiting room has both #WorldCup matches playing on their big screens
2172 2018-06-25 19:22:11 A strong $ allows them to use their USD reserves for imports (oil, etc) and a weak yuan for exports (comp. adv.) . It's a s/t to m/t strategy that also allows them to build traction in their new commodity markets without prematurely overvaluing CNY.
2173 2018-06-25 19:22:10 @OlaySkin Are you kidding me I get a request for free sample and I submit my application and they say we're sorry you don't match our Requirements all they ask for is my address! OH I GET IT IT WAS MY AGE THANKS FOR NOTHING OIL OF OLAY!
2174 2018-06-25 19:22:06 Yes, we have but our challenge was always what to do with the oil when finished... #ethicalhour

2187 2018-06-25 19:19:48 @RawBeautyKristi I use CBD oil and balm as cannabis is not legal here; however, I do not experience the same decrease in symptoms and reaction to triggers as I do with marijuana
2188 2018-06-25 19:19:47 Exactly my reaction when BP rebranded green after the oil spill: “Bless your heart...”
2189 2018-06-25 19:19:46 no patients for oil pulling but I make toothpaste out of it and baking soda! Kind of the same thing... maybe... haha #ethicalhour
2190 2018-06-25 19:19:41 tell me about the #coconut oil #teeth thing... don't mind eating it but haven't got this far yet! #ethicalhour
2191 2018-06-25 19:19:28 How anyone can possibly view this (dare I call it, desperation), as a bearish is insane. OPEC+ is admitting it cannot, as a cartel, supply even sufficient oil to satisfy its "cuts" target! Tapping into depleted spare capacity, to maintain an already constricted mkt, is BULLISH!
2192 2018-06-25 19:19:25 Nope not yet! I haven't actually used coconut oil yet though - what do you actually use it for?
2193 2018-06-25 19:19:17 Call me a snob but Baylis & Harding’s jojoba, silk and almond oil soap smells incredible.

2199 2018-06-25 19:18:29 Hi there, it is sold as vegetable oil and contains rapeseed oil. Sorry for the confusion. Chris.
2200 2018-06-25 19:18:24 I don’t know that dropping oil production by .0005% is your strongest argument.
2201 2018-06-25 19:18:18 Read a post today in FB saying:

Unless you're Olive oil, your virginity doesn't make you valuable, #StopSlutShaming
I felt that.!!
2202 2018-06-25 19:18:09 true, i also love #coconut oil! well used on face, body, hair... just not done the pulling #teeth thing yet. has anyone else #ethicalhour? @acalaonline_ @EthicalHour

2204 2018-06-25 19:17:51 Trump would bring back whale oil if he thought he could make a buck on it.
2205 2018-06-25 19:17:38 There might be an alternative to oil someday but until then pipelines are the safest way to transport oil.
2206 2018-06-25 19:17:25 I'm a brand new vegan here and I've really upped the leafy green intake since going vegan and have never had so much energy. Of course you can still choose to eat unhealthy even as a vegan (sugar, salt oil, processed foods) but when u go whole foods vegan there's no better diet
2207 2018-06-25 19:17:13 I know encouraging migration isn't helping their country. But I doubt you'll have much luck convincing Americans that they need to start another war to kill off the Mexican drug cartels when we've been in non-stop oil wars for the past 16 years. 1/2
2208 2018-06-25 19:17:09 As long as you stay away from foods that contains high fructose corn syrup, you're good to go. Also, stay away from processed foods. Steam, bake or grill your food. Sometimes cooking foods in oil produces trans fat and you DO NOT want that in your body. Good luck!
2209 2018-06-25 19:17:07 Yup...this is what just got irrigated from my left ear. 

Thank God for essential oils, peroxide, AND baby oil. 

Note to self: Q-tips are not suppose to go in your ear canal.
2210 2018-06-25 19:17:05 I just wanna chill with Ina Garten and discuss the significance of chambray & *good* olive oil
2211 2018-06-25 19:17:00 Why doesn't someone find out who has shares in those oil co's, tankers, refienery deals etc? You know. Follow the Money.
2212 2018-06-25 19:16:47 With all this trendy essential oil witchery, I learned lavender is toxic to cats. I don't use EOs because I think they're mostly just pretty smelling mumbo jumbo but I do occasionally buy the lavender scented kitty litter. Now I feel terrible for inadvertently poisoning my cats.
2213 2018-06-25 19:16:43 It’s also that shit eating grin. W has it too. He is FOR SURE a snake oil salesman but for Jesus. If you lived in the South it’s the “well bless your heart” thing.
2214 2018-06-25 19:16:41 Aih wakili....I thought Bidco & Kapa are the market leaders in cooking oil. Ama hizo pia ni za Rai? I doubt!

2216 2018-06-25 19:16:37 It’s not Tripoli or Benghazi - GNA is intl recognised government- NOC is intl recognised oil body - it’s handing it back to recognised national institutions- he’s now equates himself with Jedran - an oil pirate capturing the oil for shallow regional purposes - very dangerous
2217 2018-06-25 19:16:35 Lo bueno de todo esto es que la marca me respondió a los 7 días aplicando garantía sin pagar un solo peso, aun no me lo entregan pero ya no estoy contento con el Río ya que han sido varios detalles entre ellos el collarín del Clotch y el testigo del Oíl y ahora el motor

2221 2018-06-25 19:16:07 My beauty regime is pretty much 'notice what my face is like when I skype a client' :-) But I do use almond oil to clean it and rose water as a toner. #ethicalhour
2222 2018-06-25 19:15:58 @RichieAllenShow Richie, I very often hear people talk of genuine healers, but nobody ever names them. I understand the legal ramifications of claiming to have a cure, but the world is awash with snake oil. Where does the average person start?

2224 2018-06-25 19:15:41 @potus  Prices  will go down if we  stop exporting  oil  the  United States produces. The  the consumer - don't buy lottery tickets,  snacks, soda & coffee. That's how gas stations make their money. 13 yrs ago I wrote a letter to the editor,  within 3hrs, gas went down 50 cents.
2225 2018-06-25 19:15:39 In una giornata nera a livello globale, si esprime solo il comparto energetico "Oil & Gas" con una performance giornaliera oltre il 3%
2226 2018-06-25 19:15:32 You do know it's CBD that comes from the marijuana plant. That's a big difference.  So no marijuana has not been approved for medical use. Stop spreading #FakeNews All they've done is approve CBD mixed in with another drug. CBD oil is already legal in all 50 states.
2227 2018-06-25 19:15:19 Doesn't make sense. You're just making my point. If China pays Venezuela in yuan for oil, and that yuan is devalued against Gold, which means LESS Gold for the same yuan, how does that promote the yuan's usage for trade?
2228 2018-06-25 19:15:07 Totally agree! I'm a bamboo convert for life, plus my dentist complimented my chompers, I'd also been crushing with DIY toothpaste made of Bicarb + coconut oil #ethicalhour
2229 2018-06-25 19:15:02 The Republican Party WANTS Trump to distract us from everything they are trying to do to Americans.  They don't want American to realize that they are draining Medicare & Social Security as well are dismantling the government, selling off National Parks to oil companies &
2230 2018-06-25 19:14:32 Oh my goodness... so many are oil or butter based. That’s a hard one, but leave it with me #ethicalhour
2231 2018-06-25 19:14:22 Oromo no be crude oil 
2232 2018-06-25 19:14:15 @jamieoliver Is the plan for ppl just to shit themselves thin by using olive oil in every single recipe
2233 2018-06-25 19:14:01 That’s really hurtful to snake oil salesmen 
2234 2018-06-25 19:14:00 #TheClimateHasAlwaysChanged
I provided a link showing Exxon is working on bio fuel. I was told that's not good enough cus it's not solar....which isn't exactly a viable alternative at this time for shipping and other energy needs. 
Not arguing to keep oil forever, but real fixes
2235 2018-06-25 19:13:51 #ALEC must be exposed.

2238 2018-06-25 19:13:41 Trying out CBD Oil tomorrow for the first time. God help me. 
Fingers crossed it works. Hate being so many meds. I have munchies on hand just in case 
2239 2018-06-25 19:13:38 This me burning the midnight oil.

2243 2018-06-25 19:13:16 There’s no guarantee that the money will go to education. It’s a general fund. I know that cannabis oil and that’s stuff can be beneficial to people with seizures and stuff. However, I don’t agree with the part of the bill where people can grow their own. I don’t think
2244 2018-06-25 19:13:11 Guess I’ll get my oil changed and car cleaned out too since nobody want to do It for me .
2245 2018-06-25 19:13:11 Yes, that happened because worldwide markets crashed. Sending the price per barrel of oil above $150. Gas was also on average $1.75 at the end of 2015. Obama had nothing to do with the price.
2246 2018-06-25 19:13:09 To white liberals, brown people all look the same.
2247 2018-06-25 19:13:08 My cat is really into eating oils (like butter and margarine) so when she gets super stressed I just give a tiny little lump (not even 1/8tsp) of cbd infused coconut oil from my fav dispensary with some of her wet food. She gobbles it right up and chills her out..
2248 2018-06-25 19:12:59 get the top/base coat that has tea tree oil and bamboo from Sally Hansen it's for growth and strength I use (just started)
2249 2018-06-25 19:12:46 And, you don't think the big oil and other energy companies didn't squash anything that could provide free energy?  Ha.
2250 2018-06-25 19:12:46 Yes, the vote overrepresents dead space and irrelevant counties that are more susceptible to snake oil salesmen
2251 2018-06-25 19:12:35 3/3 “...a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor...”

2252 2018-06-25 19:12:26 No argument at all.  Interesting thing is that with Bouchard in plus really no large RFAs next year (assuming JP stays on third line) and that Russell and Sexy and even Lucic become more moveable, Oil cap space could be good for what should be a strong UFA group in 2019

2255 2018-06-25 19:12:06 I know absolutely nothing about cars so everytime I go get an oil change or anything related to my car I look so dumb cuz I can’t answer the questions 
2256 2018-06-25 19:12:06 Just watched someone run out of the gas station stealing oil!!! Wtf is wrong with people
2257 2018-06-25 19:11:57 You put coconut oil in you coffee?
2258 2018-06-25 19:11:56 Depends.  If the oil money coming in is going to a branch of the NOC, deposited in a branch of the CBL, should not that make a huge difference?
2259 2018-06-25 19:11:41 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

2261 2018-06-25 19:11:35 messi fan boys wid di powder and oil now
2262 2018-06-25 19:11:33 All you people crying about oil and how we need to get off it have no fucking idea just how much petroleum is part of daily life. Better say goodbye to life as we know it to kick the oil habbit because it's literally in everything including the cellphone your on.
2263 2018-06-25 19:11:31 I don't wear makeup, wash with soap from @soapdaze, brush my teeth with coconut oil from a glass jar, use solid deoderant...solid shampoo (tho low-poo anyway) so pretty green. Happy to hear ways to improve it, or inspire others that less is more! #ethicalhour Kate
2264 2018-06-25 19:11:27 I get my oil changed when it hits the mileage on the sticker. I tip 20% or more
2265 2018-06-25 19:11:24 Its been a year since I've been out of the fitness industry....let me check in on it. Hmmm...still the SAME. Fit pro's preaching to the ignorant and feeling SMART. Selling snake oil and cheerleading sessions with carnival act exercises.
2266 2018-06-25 19:11:23 On that oil
2267 2018-06-25 19:11:20 inhales... time to embrace the apparently awkward japanese acting and glowing oil painting
2268 2018-06-25 19:11:19 Keep doing this for as long as you can, I do it throughout the day so I’m all probably an hour and your neck will turn a little red, that means it’s working. When you wake up the next morning your hickey will be really unnoticeable or not even there! (Also, oil isn’t necessary)
2269 2018-06-25 19:11:18 At 3:05pm I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLQ18) and USO on my software.
2270 2018-06-25 19:11:11 Some olive oil is unfiltered and does look a bit cloudy, and if it’s been stored at low temps it can look cloudy - I think unfiltered has shorter shelf life
2271 2018-06-25 19:11:10 Why are y’all always thinking about Will’s penis? It’s weird and creepy.
2272 2018-06-25 19:11:07 Funny thing - you seem to spend a lot of time thinking about her, but she doesn't even know you exist and probably never will.

It must be really frustrating to see a black woman accomplish more in her life and career than you can ever aspire to.
2273 2018-06-25 19:10:56 Oil Can Harry has said something I can agree with - finally!
2274 2018-06-25 19:10:37 I had a dream that I had like 4 slabs of oil and atleast 4 zips of top shelf bud
2275 2018-06-25 19:10:34 Just book all those oil merchants ref

2278 2018-06-25 19:10:11 As you’ve all seen, I’ve been replacing a split PCV, but can anyone explain the difference between a diaphragm that recirculates the oil vapours and just a breather pipe going to atmosphere or a catch can?
What does the diaphragm actually do?
2279 2018-06-25 19:10:08 Lol you can have Trudeau, people would be crying got impeachment in the first 30 days after Carbon taxes and anti oil policies...
2280 2018-06-25 19:10:06 Although it’s impossible to make your hickey disappear minutes after you got it, you can make it go away pretty much over night. All you need is some peppermint oil and a dime/quarter. You put a little bit of peppermint oil on the hickey and rub with the ridged ends of the dime.
2281 2018-06-25 19:10:06 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2282 2018-06-25 19:10:00 In reference to flaxseed I was actually referring to actual flaxseeds not supplements. So I assume would have a very good shelf life and remain potent.  A quick search revealed other sources of Omega 3

Chia Seeds
Hemp Seeds
Mustard Oil
Beans
Seaweed
Winter squash
Leafy Greens.
2283 2018-06-25 19:10:00 It’s just gonna be abused like every other thing and I don’t believe people should be able to grow their own. I’m not against the cannabis oil or any of that stuff. But I don’t think people should be able to just obtain it to smoke
2284 2018-06-25 19:09:59 When there’s new workers at the place where I get my oil change done and they’re taking forever 
2285 2018-06-25 19:09:24 The Sisters sure the Obama Administration , not the other way around. But nice try
2286 2018-06-25 19:09:23 As you mentioned yourself, oil demand doesn’t have to drop to zero to have huge repercussions on prices. A major shift will occur when buyers start worrying about being left with stranded assets (here ICE cars).
2287 2018-06-25 19:09:15 We overtook India that has no oil...what a shame
2288 2018-06-25 19:09:02 And fuel barges, incoming oil and every other type of fossil fuel. Only outgoing Alberta crude is banned. #Hypocrisy
2289 2018-06-25 19:08:47 Saudi Arabia won today...Iran is losing..Everybody is worried about the match while am just concern about oil prices...i hope oil prices won't react to this.

@FIFAWorldCup ...please  don't crash oil prices

@OPECSecretariat  stay at alert..

2291 2018-06-25 19:08:43 Hand again once everybody has batteries you should look into the turmoil because when you try to get rid of them, just as toxic as oil if not more so. Alkaline and lithium are bery toxic my friends !
2292 2018-06-25 19:08:40 And same happens in reverse, take crude oil, generated in the ME, refined in ME, shipped into Netherlands for final refinery and sold to U.K. This is counted as import from EU / Netherlands, not ME. Strip out these elements as they inflate and distort.
2293 2018-06-25 19:08:34 It's not just my opinion that it gives this regime more ammo.  I dont wring my hands; I stand up. I am a Water Protector; I stood with my people as they took our land for Oil.  Being rude didnt get them off the land. Nor did public shaming.

Reminder that the Kim regime has fed newborn babies to dogs, forced abortions by injecting women's wombs with motor oil, and generally violated every human right you can imagine.

But they played their anthem.

2318 2018-06-25 19:05:44   duh! Sorry, I see what you are driving at now; it has been a very long day. I was of the understanding that it was just the tax on the oil revenue that was sent to hmrc, is that not correct?

2338 2018-06-25 19:02:57 Incorrect. Demand wont stop, light oil can't do it. Venezuela production plummeting. Dilbit price fall with IMO, supports capital exapnsion of cokers in Asia and elsewhere to process heavy oil.

2348 2018-06-25 19:01:24 Maybe, maybe not. If they get it their way now, it won't be the case. And if the cleaning of the oil sands sites will break the bank it will not be the case either...

The ‘state’ chose to ignore the law to save a child’s life here.

Me to me: hey buddy you done got yourself a migraine how but you take your meds rub some peppermint oil on your neck and call it day?
2369 2018-06-25 18:59:21 Under your dad's but not evwr for this country. In April let's see how all this really stands. Also with the price of oil going up let's see how the economy does with high oil and gas prices.  Good luck anyways.

2372 2018-06-25 18:59:00 Retracting oil company business licenses, despite their twitter bot blitz would be like ender’s gambit.
2373 2018-06-25 18:59:00 Just a hit of vinaigrette - it's tasty, easy on my stomach, and easy to make. 
Side note, that's one of those basic recipes everyone should learn and play with (3 oil : 1 vinegar.)  Just grab different types of oils, vinegar,  and herbs/flavorings, then come up with something.
2374 2018-06-25 18:58:55 Right if they were like u seem dry let me pour coconut oil on u, id be like who tf u calling dry

2383 2018-06-25 18:57:45 Not once in my life have I changed my oil without burning myself smh
2384 2018-06-25 18:57:41 I work in insurance and can attest to this. I once had someone tell me they were “curing” their diabetes by taking fish oil... 
2385 2018-06-25 18:57:37 Yep! You’re right. CBD oil naturally comes in strawberry flavor. What the Fuck was I thinking.
2386 2018-06-25 18:57:37 We love kale but we can only have it sprinkled with a bit of oil and sea salt and put in the oven for a few mins. Really nice, like Chinese seaweed.

2390 2018-06-25 18:56:52 We still need investments in oil at this time. We cannot crush an economy and have peoples homes and cars cost them an insane amount in order to achieve this vision .
2391 2018-06-25 18:56:46 Shah was giving oil, the Revolution changed that then US government declared economic war and you want eat out of their hands like a beggar.... you dont know the meaning of the word freedom

2393 2018-06-25 18:56:27 This was only ever snake oil and a large chunk of Cornwall too. The jobs were in the department for wishful thinking.
2394 2018-06-25 18:56:26 The world is funny.
if government finds oil in your backyard, its government property, but if they find weed my brother its yours alone.

2395 2018-06-25 18:56:23 Guy who changed my oil: “do you know how to reset your oil light”
Me: “it doesn’t have one”
Guy: “are you sure?” 
*proceeds to check my settings to make sure I’m right* 
“oh, I guess you don’t”
NO KIDDING. 
2396 2018-06-25 18:56:09 Please (please) do remember the power of the people is not with a political party or an oil company. You are what counts. Also most indy Scots are a mixed bag from RAF winchmen to dummies like me. Scottish Indy is mixed bag. But all of us are gong ho for change.

2404 2018-06-25 18:55:32 Getting my oil changed. In the waiting room is an older rugged dude in boots that is way too into this episode of The View.
2405 2018-06-25 18:55:26 No, you took your clothes off because it was too hot and then splashed hot oil on your belly 
2406 2018-06-25 18:55:07 As if Izzy’s parents cleaned out her room nd thought a bottle of poppers she had was scented oil nd fucking put it in her air diffuser ahahah
2407 2018-06-25 18:55:07 Never trust oil companies
2408 2018-06-25 18:55:04 Every time I go get my oil changed they tell me ALL the things wrong with my car(which there aren’t ANY). Like I’m about to go back to my original oil change people again bc they also don’t take an hour to change my oil. I’m so annoyed rn
2409 2018-06-25 18:54:58 on a scale of "I shop exclusively at Whole Foods" and "I make my molotov cocktails with olive oil", how vegan are you?

2413 2018-06-25 18:54:29 how about a website for idiots for grilling rubs that just uses stuff from CVS

Italian style Citrus chicken
mortar and pestle three vitamin C tablets into fine powder and add to oil of oregano. baste chicken and grill. tasty and clears colds.
2414 2018-06-25 18:54:11 Naeexpire ba ang hot oil?
2415 2018-06-25 18:54:11 ...We have elected LIQUID SNAKE to the presidency. Leverage was giving our politicans TOO MUCH CREDIT. (How DID they take out that guy who dumped oil, btw?)
2416 2018-06-25 18:54:08 Because EVERY major oil producing nation subsidizes production.  So it’s pretty obvious that the country with the most oil in G7 has the most subsidies.  I can type slower if this is difficult to follow.
2417 2018-06-25 18:53:57 One nation under GOD Gold Oil Drugs. We have taken over Afghanistan for their opium resources. Syria for their oil. And Hussein and Ghaddafi were killed for their gold and unwillingness to join to federal banking reserve....
2418 2018-06-25 18:53:54 Sadly nothing matters anymore to the Rs. Pruitt could personally release the strategic oil reserves into the ocean and the Rs would just shrug.
2419 2018-06-25 18:53:48 Venezuela is barrelling rapidly down the same road to becoming a failed state, despite its oil wealth.  I propose a democratic partition of Venezuela among Columbia, Brazil and Guyana, with a small rump remaining for those that want to stay Venezuelan.
2420 2018-06-25 18:53:46 Is cannabis messing with your life?  I’m a patient and take cannabis oil to sleep and to help with depression (replaces 3 Pharma medications and does a better job) not same as my relationship to alcohol over which I have no control.  I consider myself sober
2421 2018-06-25 18:53:42 Also cooking oil
2422 2018-06-25 18:53:28 currently getting my second oil change since having my new car & they told me it requires a special blend that costs $70 MINIMUM thanks for draining my wallet

2430 2018-06-25 18:52:33 Olive oil is the best
2431 2018-06-25 18:52:31 Yeah that’s true I think it’s more for show tbh he couldn’t really hand it back to tripoli after so many people from the east died trying to take back the oil
2432 2018-06-25 18:52:18 Can somebody put some oil on that trampoline in our neighbours garden. It is driving me up the bloody wall grrrrrrrr
2433 2018-06-25 18:52:14 I prefer extra virgin snake oil, first squeezins’ if you will.
2434 2018-06-25 18:52:01 Both the powder and oil for N2500?
2435 2018-06-25 18:51:59 Doesn’t compare to our last President using the power of the IRS to target conservative organizations, businesses and individuals.
2436 2018-06-25 18:51:42 No, unfortunately I have to call Roto rooter for a real deep cleaning. I used to use a Getty Oil drilling rig but broke all the bits.
2437 2018-06-25 18:51:29 You know who should really be wary of snake oil salesmen? Fucking snakes.
2438 2018-06-25 18:51:20 Lol, I send my security to buy me oil oh! The boy go buy oil were be like oil were them dey take make soda soap.
2439 2018-06-25 18:51:15 dont sit there vaping cbd oil in front of your 4 year old kid just because your other irresponsible friend brings their shit here. make more responsible choices.
2440 2018-06-25 18:50:45 When all the oil runs out and there is no more heating, then we'll see. Best to toughen yourself up now I reckon.
2441 2018-06-25 18:50:30 How many times do people need to be told that you can’t mix Politics & religion together. Those 2 are like oil & water, they don’t mix.
2442 2018-06-25 18:50:22 Pro of the heatwave: ready melted coconut oil. 

I now smell like a big coconut.
2443 2018-06-25 18:50:01 oil trades with the ebbs and flows of supply
2444 2018-06-25 18:49:50 You’re happy with your powers being taken from Our Parliament- our oil fund send south for a pittance back- our produce exported by English ports-happy to bargain our stuff for Brexit..Suffice to say I’m not happy .. one wee bit 
2445 2018-06-25 18:49:44 Getting the oil changed in the Hamstermobile. Let's see if they complain about the brakes this time. :p
2446 2018-06-25 18:49:24 a glut will not lower the prices, less consumption will help save the planet n a reasonable price. it's oil vs usd & it's time we study the trend most people take a break during this time of the year. does us want to bring the price to 55 a brl? v can do it. brgds v
2447 2018-06-25 18:49:18 There is no evidence oil companies are blocking anything. Demand drives the market in the US. If it increases production will follow.
2448 2018-06-25 18:49:10 It's like baby oil but snakes.

2464 2018-06-25 18:46:57 When he says “Danny Williams was a power hungry mad man who squandered our oil windfall and set the province on the wrong track” then maybe I’ll believe him.
2465 2018-06-25 18:46:42 Why would I want to live in Dubai? would probably sell it immediately to a rich oil baron for billions and billions!!.
2466 2018-06-25 18:46:40 “All the oil and dirt.” Lance said, “Two years without skin care clogs you up.” He set the cloth aside and grabbed the little tub of face mask.

2469 2018-06-25 18:46:23 I was gonna add not sure how that actually works since buyers of oil will only pay into the tripoli central bank. But u know greedy currency dealers will try and take advantage of situation
2470 2018-06-25 18:46:17 You Clearly don’t no the history of shell oil then they don’t care about people at all especially black people

2475 2018-06-25 18:45:18 They’re roughly on par IMO. In n Out burgers have a certain spartan, old-school quality that is hard to find elsewhere. Five Guys has the edge on fries (that peanut oil tho).

2479 2018-06-25 18:44:58 The only income for the treasury from oil is tax revenue. Same for businesses related to your 'resources' which are owned by private individuals, many of them foreign. Sorry, but you haven't a clue.
2480 2018-06-25 18:44:44 Yes, wasn't meant to be a dig at your Tweet the way.  Yes, crucially, how long will the oil last for motorbikes that can be heard as well as seen.

2486 2018-06-25 18:44:00 Wonder what the dollar price will be tomorrow now haftar has stopped oil revenue going to the central bank in tripoli instead sending it to the east
2487 2018-06-25 18:43:59 Its unfortunately too common with normies. I eat a double burger with bacon and avocado and it's "haha heart attack burger" but those same people eat. Nutritionally void deep fried soybean oil regularly

2499 2018-06-25 18:42:23 Why would gold and oil be up? Everything is down for the obvious reasons, trade fears.
2500 2018-06-25 18:42:19 @LOrealParisUK  I’m so disappointed to hear you no long do Elvive Extraordinary oil curl nourishment range i absolutely loved these products
2501 2018-06-25 18:42:17 "Labour" didn't sign it off, the quasi-judicial Planning Committee did. I wouldn't have done if I was on that committee. Mind you, I would have thought all that diesel would have been good for an oil trader, no?
2502 2018-06-25 18:42:13 My child got into my peppermint oil and now I smell it everywhere. I guess I shouldn’t be complaining, but still. 
2503 2018-06-25 18:42:09 Most details, granola, biscuits and margarine have palm oil in them. I have changed to butter, shortbread and Aldis granola. Read the ingredients. #saynotopalmoil #savetheOrangutang
2504 2018-06-25 18:42:07 Fed govt can't bring themselves to legalize mj, but approve it as long as there's profit to be made for major pharma companies.
This "new" drug, Epidiolex, is essentially pharmaceutical-grade version of CBD oil, which some parents already use to treat children with epilepsy.
2505 2018-06-25 18:41:41 The ironic part of offering JT bagels and chicken parm for life is he most-likely does not eat either. I see him more of a kale smoothie with fish oil guy.

2507 2018-06-25 18:41:37 @realDonaldTrump Don't forget that Jordan's Abdullah cheated the US & undermined our sanctions on Iraq during the Oil-For-Food scandal. He should be pressured to accept Palestinian refugees so UNRWA can be defunded. #JORDAN
2508 2018-06-25 18:41:37 Same h/s at 62 level abd went much higher. Bull run in oil just getting started. Specially w trade wars and iran war

2512 2018-06-25 18:41:21 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2513 2018-06-25 18:41:20 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2528 2018-06-25 18:39:19 But can you imagine the guy that has to milk the snake for that oil? Horrible job.
2529 2018-06-25 18:39:19 Stop accepting asylum claims at the border, as in other foreign countries in EU those wanting asylum in US make application at US Embassies & are vetted to make sure ppl are who they say they are, children w/them are really their kids & that their asylum claims are legit.
2530 2018-06-25 18:39:15 Got oil out today & instantly regretted it cos now I’m walking around like pingu

2533 2018-06-25 18:38:55 I spend most of my time in the supermarket googling what a food is and what does it do for me and then I buy it and never use it. Today’s buy is avocado oil

2536 2018-06-25 18:38:39 Snake oil is probably amazing.
2537 2018-06-25 18:38:35 Putin must have some embarrassing shit on Trump for him to commit to all his wishes. Russians wants big Oil companies to wildcat drill for Trillions  barrels of oil in Arctic  Sea.  Been on hold for years due to sanctions. #Butta
2538 2018-06-25 18:38:15 :( can u get some kind of hydrocortisone shots? or something like applying vitamin E oil?
2539 2018-06-25 18:38:13 What r u doin? This is not important. Iran is going to sell oil in Euro. EU is cool with it too. Nordstream2. China will be happy to buy up that oil too. You are pissing everyone off and America’s influence and Dollar will crumble. Tariffs wont solve these issues either.
2540 2018-06-25 18:38:08 @GovMikeHuckabee Ya know why people hate  ya mike? Cuz you wrap yourself up in holier than thou piety as you exude hate and xenophobia from your every pore. Like a snake oil salesmen. Also, congrats for making a daughter as vile, mendacious and sententious as you.
2541 2018-06-25 18:38:02 Oh yeah because the Nuns should pay for birth control.....keep in mind the Nuns were doing charity work not slopping up free rage,non gmo gluten free VODKA MARTINIS BUT the neurotic wait staff was triggered.If this nonsense keeps up I'm going to need a drink myself.
2542 2018-06-25 18:37:57 Everyone knows you need 1000 grams of pure protein soaked in fish oil and creatine every day to prevent yourself from withering into a soyboy pile of shame.

2547 2018-06-25 18:37:35 Beautiful.
2548 2018-06-25 18:37:23 Appreciate the view while you can before the oil rigs show up and ur out there washing sea life with Dawn dish soap. EPA IS DEAD with Trump.
2549 2018-06-25 18:37:08 Go in for a simple oil change and ending needing 4 other things 
2550 2018-06-25 18:37:07 Yeah, I meant theft (land, oil, culture, money etc etc)! Pretty much the perfect metaphor.
2551 2018-06-25 18:37:07 Beautiful. Tennessee is better, tbh ;)
2552 2018-06-25 18:37:05 You can get medical marijuana that has all of the hallucanagins removed. It’s called CBD or hemp oil. You can order it online since it’s not considered illegal.
2553 2018-06-25 18:36:59 Also how can Josh be sat in the shade and burn and I'm sat directly in the sunlight with oil on and I don't change colour at all
2554 2018-06-25 18:36:59 look, just give it to me and i'll take care of it, all right

chef! can i get you to prepare me a DEEP FRYER FULL OF PEANUT OIL HEATED TO 375, THANK YOU
2555 2018-06-25 18:36:47 But, with Flake in open rebellion, the pace of judicial appointments is under threat.
The coalition is separating like snake oil and water. "Winning" is not a strategy for good governance.
We are governed by a minority representative govt. Civil unrest is to be expected.
2556 2018-06-25 18:36:47 Your sister single?
2557 2018-06-25 18:36:45 I’m a sucker for cheap oil paintings of mountains with ducks/deer/any animals on them at Cabelas or other outfitting stores.
2558 2018-06-25 18:36:35 完走お疲れ様です！
2559 2018-06-25 18:36:22 Maybe left can strap a jug of oil on every illegals back instead of dope and we all be driving on the cheap
2560 2018-06-25 18:36:21 Olive oil and balsamic vinegar are really all I use is a salad dressing. Sometimes I use Italian dressing, but that's only on a caesar salad.
2561 2018-06-25 18:36:14 I find avocado toast to be pretty bland. Which is weird because I love some avocado doused in lime. And I love toast. I've been going for some olive oil to add that extra kick, which tastes pretty good.
2562 2018-06-25 18:36:12 Mine went away after two or three months, with consistent use of oil mixed in my body lotion.
2563 2018-06-25 18:35:45 Note to self: Wake the fuck up earlier so you can take your car to mevhanic at a reasonable time for an oil change s-h-i-t
2564 2018-06-25 18:35:30 ♫And then one day he was shootin at some food, 
And up through the ground come a bubblin crude. 
Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea♫.....aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
2565 2018-06-25 18:35:28 Unless this drug is as cheap as the CBD oil that you can get from medical cannibus dispensaries don't bother.  If you live in a state where cannibus is still illegal then at least you will have this. I hate that big Pharma is getting into this.  Just another way to rip us off.
2566 2018-06-25 18:35:24 A bronzing facial mask, light white, with coconut oil, Rhassoul clay, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It comes as a water-soluble gel.
2567 2018-06-25 18:35:20 In that case: they were deliberately disobeying the law.
2568 2018-06-25 18:35:16 um you do know  kinder morgan  broke the  BC  law  when they built the burnaby   plant and the oil spill in kamloops was 10X the size they  first posted , justin  just bought a lemon  oil company with a real bad environment  record

2570 2018-06-25 18:35:00 i had no idea about the sustainability of palm oil just a few weeks ago but now that i’m aware i’m so happy in a just a couple of years every palm oil used in europe will be sustainable
2571 2018-06-25 18:34:54 A few days ago I started using tea tree oil as a spot treatment for my acne. 10/10 would recommend
2572 2018-06-25 18:34:53 Anbody using morrocan argan oil should seriously take a look at their football team.. Half of these guys are bald
2573 2018-06-25 18:34:43 Roughly 230,000 gallons of oil spilled into the #RockRiver in #Iowa after a train derailed. Residents living bevy to the incident were forced to evacuate and the city of #RockValley had to shut off its water wells. No word yet on what caused the incident.
2574 2018-06-25 18:34:41 Ha!  I think my grandfather is a generation older than yours though. He really did work for John D. in NYC. We have ancient Standard Oil novelty Christmas candles!
2575 2018-06-25 18:34:40 One reason if many I despise him! We’ve fought to keep oil out of the oceans  and he’s taking us backwards! He only caters to the oil companies not clean energy ! This is to ship we have enough here ! Enough oil pollution enough noise pollution enough sonar pollutionDrumph
2576 2018-06-25 18:34:40 Haha...you said clash blaster...ha
2577 2018-06-25 18:34:37 The lack international recognition, oil companies abroad will hesitate to wire any money to them unless they have that recognition.
2578 2018-06-25 18:34:35 And I was on a Ship during and after the Gulf War and was alongside in Kuwait. When for 2 days we never saw daylight, because of the Fires in the Oil wells. Thank you for your service. Every time I coughed or blown my nose, I had black phlegm.
2579 2018-06-25 18:34:33 60 drops of thc/CBD oil....I'm fucked
2580 2018-06-25 18:34:21 When it comes to trump always track the oil that’s been his obsession for decades!
2581 2018-06-25 18:34:17 So straight which way oil is heading
2582 2018-06-25 18:34:15 Fuckin oil money... smh

2584 2018-06-25 18:33:57 @gatewaypundit your large orange father told supporters to beat up protestors. Sit back down in your puddle of oil, junior.
2585 2018-06-25 18:33:51 - How are you going to get the resources to create the several social programs without rising the taxes as you promised?
- We're going to get rid of the corruption
- And how are you going to pay a possible nationalization of the oil?
- We're going to get rid of the corruption
2586 2018-06-25 18:33:51 Ummm, I'm talking about the govt taking them to court over birth control.
2587 2018-06-25 18:33:50 はぁ？嘘つきwww
2588 2018-06-25 18:33:46 Ha, I do the same but for my running clients ;) Just got an oil change last week and there was coffee AND popcorn at the shop! #runningcoach
2589 2018-06-25 18:33:41 Finally getting an oil change lol I’m like 15,000 miles past
2590 2018-06-25 18:33:39 More oil is the least thing the earth needs so searching for it is just stupid!
2591 2018-06-25 18:33:37 If you want to access oil deposits off shore, use slant drilling. That way all the equipment is on dry land and accidents are easier to deal with. Remember Deep Horizon.  Don’t need another one of those.
2592 2018-06-25 18:33:36 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
2593 2018-06-25 18:33:25 hey! some snake oil salesmen actually sold snake oil, some.
2594 2018-06-25 18:33:19 If you don't do a yang/blake voiceover I'm unscrubing, blocking, and reporting for harassment/bullying

2597 2018-06-25 18:32:55 Nobody wants to spend $400 to fix a fucking oil pan on a car. When I say I’m salty.... BOIIII. I’m fuckin SALTY. 
2598 2018-06-25 18:32:53 I use a beard oil from Murdock’s.  Creams and pastes will sit in the beard and won’t get down to your skin
2599 2018-06-25 18:32:53 Oil change . Let’s see how long I’m here.
2600 2018-06-25 18:32:50 ...until another type of energy is discovered...that would replace the primitive/obsolete/polutant oil...these scenery will happen again and again...too bad...
2601 2018-06-25 18:32:39 Norway has been drilling off its shores for over 40 yrs & has never had an oil spill. Norwegian fyords are more beautiful than ever.  Oil revenues have made Norway's standard of living one of the highest in the world. Meanwhile, OPEC is pushing up oil prices (gas price up $0.60).
2602 2018-06-25 18:32:39 あ、そういうことね配慮できてなくてごめんなさいむしろしっかり出来てるか心配になるんよ〜理系の人は世話好きな人多いからねー
2603 2018-06-25 18:32:24 There is noway we can trade our ancestral land for peace, there is noway we can allow oil transportation while we are living in fear.

2604 2018-06-25 18:32:20 Extraordinarily low doesn't do justice to someone with an IQ in the 20-30 range, and that is being kind to the Congresswoman.  So sad a simpleton can be elected. Again, how does she afford her houses?  Ethics violations?  Husband's business dealings.  Pathetic. Joke. LA's finest.
2605 2018-06-25 18:32:16 @trevortombe @andrew_leach @gilmcgowan do any of you have any idea why Alberta enjoyed huge oil investment/production in 1970s/80s/90s and Saskatchewan didn’t?
2606 2018-06-25 18:32:14 Haggard booking photos seems to be the hallmark of Tommy Lee's exes.
2607 2018-06-25 18:32:09 China, through which roughly 90 percent of GDP on infrastructure, while the oil market?
2608 2018-06-25 18:32:05 Ive asked a lot of anti indy people two questions
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues?
2) do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
Only the extreme union at all cost types ever answer,which says it all really!
2609 2018-06-25 18:32:01 The turkana community residents on preparation  to prottest and to STOP! oil transport. Due to insecurity problem that the goverment have terribly failed to solve .
2610 2018-06-25 18:31:59 Feeling hungry while burning the midnight oil is nothing but torturing.....
2611 2018-06-25 18:31:59 Also , 
A drop of oil on the soul of a foot of a ADD or Hyper active person cures it , Even the non THC Hemp oil ,
Or a drop under the tongue .
2612 2018-06-25 18:31:57 CBD massage oil helps for this! I’ve been using it when I’m sore and it’s been helping!
2613 2018-06-25 18:31:53 With a mission of expanding oil drilling -- not promoting ocean science and conservation.
2614 2018-06-25 18:31:36 Hmm...

All over "whiskey" like a rash, yet completely ignores the point made about oil.

Why might that be, I wonder?
2615 2018-06-25 18:31:32 I never saw peak oil as a cliff, but as a 'fat-tail' event with a long, slow decline. But yeah, virtually every report I see about climate change is "worse than we thought," "faster than we thought," etc.
2616 2018-06-25 18:31:31 Up your level in cooking, use a small bit of oil, stir occasionally, and rinse after dumping the water, unless you need a bit more body for the sauce use a little splash of the pasta water in the sauce to enrichen it
2617 2018-06-25 18:31:28 Both!

Bacon, Lap Chong (chinese sausage) and Fried Fish Ball!

Bacon contains a whole LOT of oil compared to sausage, but adding both will make it SPECTACULAR!

The rice absorbs it and it enhances the taste exponentially!
2618 2018-06-25 18:31:27 @boloco Can’t say enough about crew at 50 Congress St. Boston. Your food is so fresh, properly seasoned, not too salty like one of you competitors! Allergen safe bowl put together for me. So grateful that you smartly use olive oil and not soy. Miss you in Wellesley and Natick !

2620 2018-06-25 18:31:03 I think we are the biggest oil exporter now because of fracking. Why do you think gas prices are still low? The libs don't want us to know that, so msm won't report on it. #winning #maga

2626 2018-06-25 18:30:30 No man washes clothes or worries about cooking oil in this country. Only women are scrubbing detergent powder on clothes and worrying about ‘light oil’ for heart and cholesterol in adverts on TV.
2627 2018-06-25 18:30:30 Guns, oil, airports & fortress Europe. 
If you aren't into that, then Chuka doesn't want to know.
2628 2018-06-25 18:30:20 You got to love this. Another red wave coming
2629 2018-06-25 18:30:06 i mainly do it for hot cheetos but i do it to regular chips sometimes so i dont dirty my keyboard/mouse with oil
2630 2018-06-25 18:30:01 Nope. One is only relevant because of oil money and the other lot are just pressure merchants.
2631 2018-06-25 18:29:52 Getting my oil changed and they done sold me on a new damn air filter 
2632 2018-06-25 18:29:45 When the donkey of the west stood, then the trap of Anu will fell the vats of oil!
2633 2018-06-25 18:29:33 Hey! We do more than farm. We have oil fields too. But, yeah I think he's gone. Especially if LeBron goes to LA
2634 2018-06-25 18:29:29 He showed his birth certificate and yet people like you are still non believers. It’s sad that you follow a snake oil salesmen and believe what he says.
2635 2018-06-25 18:29:23 Fanatics supported by your tribe. In fact the Yorubas is partially responsible for what's happening now because they are supporting the terrorist we have as a president.
2636 2018-06-25 18:29:20 My Grandfather worked for Standard Oil & Mobil almost his entire career. Or as he jokingly said, for old Jack (John D. Rockefeller).
2637 2018-06-25 18:29:10 Swear i just be spending money. Oil change & a detail today
2638 2018-06-25 18:28:53 Italian men like their women just like they like their olive oil.
2639 2018-06-25 18:28:52 I once took a wrong turn outside Glasgow looking for a retail park and found myself in a derelict area, two guys in wool coats and the shiniest Range Rovers, with dogs and a burning oil drum.... never reversed back out of somewhere without stopping to change gear.

2641 2018-06-25 18:28:33 Absolutely. I refuse to take benzodiazepines (xanax, valium, klonopin)  as they are highly addictive and I dont want to play with fire. I smoke marijuana in general, but use the CBD oil specifically to control my anxiety. It can also help digestive issues as well
2642 2018-06-25 18:28:11 Taking my car in to the shop tonight. It's just an oil change and check of my parking brake, but I'm irrationally concerned I'll get a call about something major wrong. No, it seems fine when I drive it. Yes, it passed safety this year. 

Here's hoping it's just an oil change 
2643 2018-06-25 18:27:59 "Rock Castle" 48"x72" oil on canvas, a work in progress
and detail
2644 2018-06-25 18:27:42 What Adder said. And again, Ken, where did I say ban oil based products? Or oil at all. Let me make this crystal clear: I oppose offshore drilling. Period.
2645 2018-06-25 18:27:30 Shhh we can get a parallel at an Atlas dance where everyone kisses their partners. Ren kisses Nora, Blake kisses Yang, Ilia and Ruby fight over who kisses Weiss, and Jaune can kiss his shield

2647 2018-06-25 18:27:08 I just wish I had that oil pen like right now.
2648 2018-06-25 18:27:07 Great who paying 4 the oil change
2649 2018-06-25 18:26:58 I went to the dealership because I’m still on warranty. I got an oil change but they said something was wrong with my brakes sooo yeah 
2650 2018-06-25 18:26:57 Abundance of Oil in Iran has made thm slippery. Wow
2651 2018-06-25 18:26:52 I used a retinol oil thing, I can't find the exact one I used but it really worked and loads of brands do them x
2652 2018-06-25 18:26:51 drenched myself in tanning oil & this little girl comes up to me talm bout “wow you are one sweaty lifeguard” 
2653 2018-06-25 18:26:40 that is just utter pish. and even if they did, your rancid party kept scots poor at the height of an oil boom to keep the feckless scots voting labour. Denied generations norway style life chances. You are actually worse than tories in my eyes.
2654 2018-06-25 18:26:37 Salah maybe is right that he should quit the Egypt team given that they let him down yet again by losing to the oil merchant Saudi Arabia! Losing to them is no way to show respect to your Egyptian king! #WorldCup #LFC

2656 2018-06-25 18:26:34 I need recommendations for a great hair moisturizer and hair oil. All natural products, preferably black-owned
2657 2018-06-25 18:26:33 My Gripe being WM has taken 92% of scots oil for 50 years and STILL managed to near bankrupt an oil rich country.
Now scots are treated like a colony by a WM corrupted by the right wing.
The rich are in the commons Dafydd,it could not be more serious
2658 2018-06-25 18:26:20 @AztecDuncan predicts that if AMLO is elected, there is likely to be a freezing of future Pemex oil auctions. #MexicanElection
2659 2018-06-25 18:26:18 Oil changed so back in sports mode I go 
2660 2018-06-25 18:26:08 Leaving thursday to start the oil field
2661 2018-06-25 18:26:03 Went for an oil change. They said I neeeded new brake pads or some lol so oil change + new brake pads = sadness
2662 2018-06-25 18:25:59 Selling more Snake oil Nige ?
2663 2018-06-25 18:25:55 @larrygloverlive There was a football player that was going to Auburn but he had seizures and he was taking that CBD oil’s and the NCAA said he couldn’t play because of the drug
2664 2018-06-25 18:25:48 See this is why you oil your stuff so they slide it in never get thier footing
2665 2018-06-25 18:25:30 #PT LNA took a decision to hand over the all terminals and oil fields under his protection to #Parallel NOC in Benghazi, The decision will accuses to NOC in Tripoli to forces majeure force on the terminals in RasLanuf and EsSidra and also #Harega terminal in Tubruk
2666 2018-06-25 18:25:29 No this is what over compensating for a small penis look like
2667 2018-06-25 18:25:18 Oil wealth has been more of problem as gift for #Iran. While the Shah government had to handle too much responsibility as well as blame for being in control of #oil, the Ayatollahs the opposite, since they have oil they don't give a damn about th people, their personal piggy bank
2668 2018-06-25 18:24:58 Does anyone know how much olive oil you are supposed to pour in your ear? It’s costing me a fortune
2669 2018-06-25 18:24:51 on oil, didn't deregulate everything for companies to abuse the environment, didn't remove protections on hunting endangered animals. I'm sure I could think of some more if I had the time but sadly I have to go in 15 minutes. So yeah Good day.
2670 2018-06-25 18:24:48 RIP your mentions.
2671 2018-06-25 18:24:47 This is so funny, I heard this exact same thing when I was getting my oil changed. I was in the waiting room with two Liberians who were talking, talking, talking.  I learned a lot about them and their family!
2672 2018-06-25 18:24:41 Alec watched magnus, his eyes couldnt leave the other even if he wanted.
Once magnus was laying down, alec moved, straddling the others back, oils in his hand.
"You ready?" He questioned, pouring some oil.
2673 2018-06-25 18:24:40 If you work in the oil and gas industry, stainless steel nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
2674 2018-06-25 18:24:34 That’s what Len said. Labour was going to dance to his tune. I would have rathe Len had tried to save oil workers jobs.
2675 2018-06-25 18:24:21 An independent Scotland would have all oil & gas platforms top and bottom sides designed fabricated and built in Scotland 
All platforms at present are built outside Scotland it’s time people woke up that we the people decide where these get built
2676 2018-06-25 18:24:05 minha pele ta tao macia acho um pecado ngm fazer carinho nesse pedaço do céu cuidado com hidratante neutrogena e bio oil
2677 2018-06-25 18:24:05 the smell of oil / car damage could be masking it

2680 2018-06-25 18:23:58 I wonder what's going to happen when they go after a man??  Are they scared to do that since men typically will fight back faster than a woman?  & I guess feminism is only for those that agree with them. Hypocrites.
2681 2018-06-25 18:23:43 Just finished curing a batch of #patchouli soap here at 7th Street! Patchouli oil can help soothe inflammation, speed up healing, prevent infections, and make you smell good!
2682 2018-06-25 18:23:39 Hi, pls what’s d @FAAN_Official policy on flying w/palm oil (2ltrs, chkd-in bag)? No explanation from the FAAN staff at MMIA Ikeja to my info request. cc @fmtaviation @ServicomOffice @KenyaAirways @NigeriaNewsdesk @icao @fao #airportseizures #security #PalmOil
2683 2018-06-25 18:23:31 This can really help patients with dosing their meds better. I’ve been making my daughters cannabis oil for years and still don’t have dosing right.
2684 2018-06-25 18:23:27 Use #Tahiti monoï oil it's awesome 
2685 2018-06-25 18:23:26 "Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face."
2686 2018-06-25 18:23:19 Oil is prehistoric. It's time to move into the 21st century.
2687 2018-06-25 18:23:13 #6 

but by that time railroads and refrigeration had already created broad markets for food. which prior to that had been extremely restricted in the distance that it could be transported. 

of course less perishable foodstuffs like flour oil wine dried meat etc were portable
2688 2018-06-25 18:23:03 Started using beard oil and it’s pretty life changing.
2689 2018-06-25 18:22:55 If data is the new oil, how do you protect it?
2690 2018-06-25 18:22:52 العسكر يُعيدون OIL الى موطنه ...

2692 2018-06-25 18:22:51 Who is this Raju fella. Does he make curry past?
2693 2018-06-25 18:22:50 gotta go get a fucking oil change  
thats why i need a nigga again .
2694 2018-06-25 18:22:40 This drinking water thing, why do you say that? We are not contaminating drinking water in the Oil and Gas industry, it’s not like we are dumping vast amounts of raw sewage into our oceans and rivers, oh wait.....
2695 2018-06-25 18:22:28 Really! This market rally is in trouble unless @potus steps in NOW! Nobody cares about higher oil prices if markets are doing great! But lately it looks like mr. President is killing his own legacy! Stop the trade war roderick!! Please reverse this bleeding! Please #maga

2697 2018-06-25 18:22:15 Too much oil over there.  In order to invade say you're going to change from the dollar to the euro.
2698 2018-06-25 18:22:11 @LNASpox If they think they will be able to sell oil by way of Eastern NOC , they are mistaken.
2699 2018-06-25 18:22:03 Micromanaging oil is of the utmost importance. He can move forward or back with his buttons while oiled and his command throws get greater range. His slider travels faster and farther as well. Too much for me to keep track of personally lol.

2701 2018-06-25 18:21:58 Today has been miserable. On the way to a very important appointment my xar broke down and has no oil after i just had the oil changed Friday, I had to have my car towed and insurance doesn't cover it, then i get a call from my college that all my documents aren't in.
2702 2018-06-25 18:21:46 Can somebody go take my car to get a oil change and get It washed . Please pretty please.
2703 2018-06-25 18:21:37 damnnn what’s da formula ? you been marinating yo shit w dat oil huh ? lol
2704 2018-06-25 18:21:36 Feds don’t run the rails. They subsidize them and Amtrak pays back more subsidies than oil and auto combined.
2705 2018-06-25 18:21:23 Volvo C30 T5
The PCV is blown...which isn’t a serviceable part...it’s part of the oil filter housing...which is under the airbox...which doesn’t fit between the inlet manifold and slam panel once undone.

2706 2018-06-25 18:21:05 its wierd you don't see the alberta premier in the news any more its like 1 Mega oil spill and Kinder Morgan Breaking the law really quiet her down  and now this  she is on a roll with a new oil spill  wow her  environmental  report this year is going to be bad  To GREEDY i guess

2715 2018-06-25 18:20:04 Typical liberal response: 

"OMG! Trump obviously called Maxine 'low IQ' because she's Black!"

Liberals always reveal their true racist inner thoughts.
2716 2018-06-25 18:20:04 If only pipelines were being built instead, a much safer way to carry oil.
2717 2018-06-25 18:20:00 5 hard facts:

- we all need a community
- essential oil and juice cleanse pyramid schemes are dumb
- the global elites are lying to us
- Steak-umm is 100% beef
- nobody talks about how much you'll come to love existing on this planet yet simultaneously never feel like you belong
2718 2018-06-25 18:19:55 If they only had oil, the West would have intervened by now.
2719 2018-06-25 18:19:51 There's not enough time or oil to give them the massage they deserve 
2720 2018-06-25 18:19:49 Lmao. You know a guy named "oil can" is going to say something dumb
2721 2018-06-25 18:19:39 Of course, I will be on hopefully around 6. I'm getting an oil change today
2722 2018-06-25 18:19:39 Weed oil?

2730 2018-06-25 18:18:57 ...and his sheeple continue to praise him. 
2731 2018-06-25 18:18:49 You're absolutely right! His pic is completely improper. He's wearing too many clothes. Ya know, I considered doing a gofundme like Will's, except everyone would be paying for me to put MORE clothes on. #ammosexual
2732 2018-06-25 18:18:48 Mi oil a overflow 
2733 2018-06-25 18:18:48 Sad that this man doesn't know what's even happening around him. Who is exploring the lake chad for oil? Stop being a clown.
2734 2018-06-25 18:18:44 All of this just to make oil boil.

2738 2018-06-25 18:18:10 4 things that are shaping global energy landscape @IEABirol 1. China’s push for clean energy, number one in solar, wind, natural gas 2. Renewable energy becoming competitive 3. US energy revolution - undisputed leader of oil and gas growth 4. Electrification @BrookingsInst

2740 2018-06-25 18:17:57 Put some china oil on a tissue and sniff at it. After 10 minutes of extreme nose running you will breath like a god!
2741 2018-06-25 18:17:53 Oil is in its teenage years, trying to find itself, not sure which direction to take in its remaining Q life cycle, its parents OPEC and Russia left it hanging after proping it up for so long, in the process oil is developing severe acne and loosing its voice 
2742 2018-06-25 18:17:50 Just saw “Loving Vincent”, the completely oil painted film, and it was astounding. *****
2743 2018-06-25 18:17:49 En realidad si lees el 1er tuit, me refiero a los contenidos (no a la narración de los partidos) y es que cuando no está en tus manos poder cambiarle de canal (porque estoy en una casa ajena) ver a los conductores haciéndose los chistosos, es patético
2744 2018-06-25 18:17:46 Can someone please tell me where to go to get my oil changed
2745 2018-06-25 18:17:42 .@IEA head @IEABirol says world faces energy upheaval from China’s push into clean tech & renewables; falling cost of renewables; US oil and gas; and electrification
2746 2018-06-25 18:17:25 Startling revelation from one who is finally revealing that he too is a Stable Genius. Yes, non-Trumpanzees need to treat his followers like a hornets' nest, fearful that they will all attack all at once. Can I get a volume discount if I buy more than one bottle of snake oil?
2747 2018-06-25 18:17:22 Obama always accused Bush of Oil meddling war. Obama meddled in Oil too. He just let enemies run free while he did it by hiring mercs to do dirty work and avoid "boots on the ground" same thing with arming terrorists.

2754 2018-06-25 18:16:57 Yoga without pranayama is running your car without oil. It makes no sense. The link was to show you that I do do yoga and pranayama. I wasn't even asking advice on the posts. I was talking about a completely different thing.

2764 2018-06-25 18:15:43 Lots of micromanaging oil right?
2765 2018-06-25 18:15:41 Ew. Sounds like you dodged a bullet there 
2766 2018-06-25 18:15:41 Girl  I love rose water. That all sounds lit and in that order too lol I wear SPF every day too but I basically have the same routine except I use a diff oil 
Your skin doesn’t even seem problematic either
2767 2018-06-25 18:15:35 @27MilanLucic We want you back! Going to be a great season! You have a ton of fans in Oil Country
2768 2018-06-25 18:15:33 And make no mistake. The BO Admin knew exactly what they were doing when they promulgated the regs. Bank on it.
2769 2018-06-25 18:15:32 @SerraNashville thanks for wasting my day. Had appointment for 1030 for oil change and here it is 1:11pm and vehicle hasn't been touched. I'm taking my business elsewhere. Leaving with no oil change.

2777 2018-06-25 18:14:58 Hi! Can it be used with a regular vape pen? Also, do u use the cbd oil? Or is there a specific one?
2778 2018-06-25 18:14:57 One could argue there wasn't enough coconut oil. Would probably have made the final boss, The Calamity Stir, trivial. But partying up with ya on epic quests is always fun!
2779 2018-06-25 18:14:55 Ed a poor decision. 
We need it to remain competitive.

2786 2018-06-25 18:14:01 It's frustrating Trump is rude obnoxious says horrible things and the GOP and most of his cult is no better and we continue to play nice and it's like it's not even noticed,  the squeaky wheel gets the oil
2787 2018-06-25 18:13:58 I think I got the rosehip oil! But mostly, I need someone to teach me how to put all this stuff on.
2788 2018-06-25 18:13:54 Today I paid my bills, put auto insurance in my name, and got my oil changed. Being an adult is too expensive.

2793 2018-06-25 18:13:31 Make it smell nice!! I bought my man a beard oil once and it smelled reaaaal organic. And by that I mean like dirt 
2794 2018-06-25 18:13:28 Which is a number I would be completely fine with but if he can get more, good on him.
2795 2018-06-25 18:13:27 Buuuuttttt... it’s a Bloody Mary so that’s kind of manly. Right?
2796 2018-06-25 18:13:09 We don’t need to wait until the oil runs out, we just seen what happens when oil goes from $130 a barrel to $30, the problem is even with that massive drop in revenue we still are held to the same equalization commitments
2797 2018-06-25 18:13:06 Obviously Ideal for heating engineers, bathroom fitters etc. Have to add, my OCD makes me change the oil and filter every 5000 miles as well. Van is a peach!!
2798 2018-06-25 18:12:59 Thanks so much for including us in this lovely line-up. So glad you love the 7 Wonders oil!

2801 2018-06-25 18:12:42 @RichardDelaSky Something is not making sense to me and Need clarification. We are an oil producing country, how come our one and only refinery doesn't have CRUDE oil for its operations? It just doesn't make sense. As for privatization it is a NO NO.

2825 2018-06-25 18:09:51 A $30 oil changed just turned into $100 because nothing is ever simple.
2826 2018-06-25 18:09:50 Unfortunate. The oil must make it to market. The world is not ready to move away from overconsumption of oil. With all the Master Minds in Governments, how is it that it’s not law: All gas stations must provide all alternative fuels! Gas, electric, hydrogen...

2850 2018-06-25 18:07:16 So I went out on the perfect date with this guy Friday. He asked what I’m doing today & I said getting an oil change & inspection. He said me to wait bc he’s about to come do it for me.

2885 2018-06-25 18:03:47 I have fairly strong climate beliefs. I also work for an oil company. Life has compromises. I (and others) like to think our company tries to do good, but there is also a lot of horrific shit in our past (and probably our present tbh).

2901 2018-06-25 18:02:14 Environment regulations are not that stringent. Don’t put carcinogens in drinking water is a perfectly reasonable requirement. Also we don’t need them to live, we lived without them for along time. We just need to develop renewables to the point where oil is not necessary.
2902 2018-06-25 18:02:12 So is the Oil resource still going to be used for construction or just fuel?
2903 2018-06-25 18:02:09 ok, friends. here is the deal. brushing your teeth with tumeric mixed in coconut oil DOES whiten your teeth and is very good for your gums. what i just learned is that it will also stain your toothbrush in the process and make a huge mess.

2926 2018-06-25 17:59:51 Yeah oil has always been an Achilles Heel for you  - ten minutes of blissful sheen gives way to a week of coarse ruddy blotches. The sacrifices of art!

2931 2018-06-25 17:59:23 Waiting for an oil change is the worst.
2932 2018-06-25 17:59:21 I just spoke with Lyon Co. Sheriff Stewart Vanderstoep. He tells me that he doesn’t know the exact amount of oil cleaned up from the train derailment in Doon, IA. But says the water is actually starting to look like water again.
2933 2018-06-25 17:59:10 I need that Italian olive oil plug
2934 2018-06-25 17:59:07 LNA used to protect and never interfered in Sanalla's NOC. Sadiq Kabeer CBL sponsors militias & extremist who attack the oil ports. People die, and so on. This's a silly game that should have been stopped long time ago. NOC must back to Benghazi & Kabeer has to change to end this

2937 2018-06-25 17:58:57 There's 4.725 square miles of solar panels in the province of Ontario, enough land to grow 251 Million corn plants at 9/sq foot. All of this only can produce a MAXIMUM of 2.4% of Ontario's electricity demand. Oil will be around for a while.

You're trying to "ignore" my tweets? Does that mean you're following me? If you are, unfollow! See, that wasn't too hard, was it?

2951 2018-06-25 17:57:23 what other than that its needed for buying oil gives the USD a bid now that the US military are no longer able to kill heads of states that accept alternative settlement?

- especially, knowing, for sure, that USTs are worthless "paper" trading 100% on the greater fool theory..
2952 2018-06-25 17:57:16 My poor car needs a bath and a oil change

2956 2018-06-25 17:56:44 It ships the oil out of Canada. Alberta would benifit from the workers pulling the oil out. How does someone in Quebec benifit if oil is pulled out of Alberta and sent to China?
2957 2018-06-25 17:56:40 OPEC's decision to increase oil production by 700,000 barrels per day & the Supreme Court overturning the 1992 Quill decision will RIPPLE through the U.S. economy

2962 2018-06-25 17:55:58 SAME. I used it last night and my skin is so beautiful today. The Ordinary's AHA/BHA peel is similar, but only $10 or so 

Oh and I also use The Ordinary's rosehip seed oil as my last layer for my night routine.

2967 2018-06-25 17:55:47 really?  stock markets disagree.  since trump administration's effects are actually being felt market is down 2000 points. doesn't seem very optimistic to me.  oil prices up and stock market down. drop taxes to corporations and raise tariffs (tax) on everything else.
2968 2018-06-25 17:55:39 Yes oil based products. But finite amounts of oil. Burning oil for energy is the least efficient way to use oil. After all, we no longer hunt whales to light our lamps. Progress needs change.

3004 2018-06-25 17:52:09 PUFAs are not something anyone should have in their life in massive quantities. Please stop marketing this as avo mayo, as it is still high in omega 6, your label is a lie. Canola flower has to be processed to death with hexane to make it an oil. Oxidization isn't cool.
3005 2018-06-25 17:52:04 But you would advise him to approve every oil pipeline imaginable. So what you think is good advice is relative.

3008 2018-06-25 17:51:49 He’s not hurting them. They hurt themselves by being narrowminded crazy people.

-Advice on anything purchasable (vape etc) to help my pain
3028 2018-06-25 17:49:56 I definitely checked rain check on getting my car washed after the oil change but here Iam waiting for it to be finished being washed
3029 2018-06-25 17:49:39 And fish oil, fish meal, etc.

3031 2018-06-25 17:49:23 Norway is an oil rich country though
3032 2018-06-25 17:49:19 9th- Put puppet governments or military regimes that aren’t  concerned with the people but let the US do whatever they want in their country.

10th- The purpose of these wars is influenced by the the armaments industry. oil industry, power and geopolitical games.
3033 2018-06-25 17:49:16 But they will run out, and the biggest revenue generators are also the worst for the environment. Not the faults of communities that don’t have oil under them.

3042 2018-06-25 17:48:37 Canada biggest export to USA is oil, so guessing you need that and other commodities. Of course, Canada needs those US dollars
3043 2018-06-25 17:48:32 I’m always nervous when people tell me to wash my face with oil. I assume ima look like a pizza after.
3044 2018-06-25 17:48:31 Laundry, oil change, and get this damn headlight fixed 
3045 2018-06-25 17:48:27  Right. I'll take the one off the oil tank & face it on the water tank instead. Thanks for the great advice.
3046 2018-06-25 17:48:25 When drilling for oil was a start-up industry in the 1890s, it cost today's equivalent of $500 a barrel to get it out of the ground, according to UC San Diego's James Hamilton in his study Oil Prices, Exhaustible Resources, and Economic Growth.

3050 2018-06-25 17:48:13 Look it up on Stats Can doesnt tell that story. While oil prices are rebounding so is the Alberta economy. I am sure it isn't great, but i dont see any big increases in the public service in Alberta. If the public service is bloated it didnt happen in just the last couple years
3051 2018-06-25 17:48:13 BC blocked the pipeline, not the east. And I am pretty sure that BC doesn’t receive equalization payments. Also Only BC and Alberta would’ve benifit from the pipeline. Canadian imports tons of oil,we should be sending oil east so the east doesn’t have to buy high cost foreign oil
3052 2018-06-25 17:48:12 What will happen when oil runs out? Under equalization, I guess all the Albertans can stay in Alberta and leech of all the other provinces. 

Brilliant program. . .
3053 2018-06-25 17:47:52 @elonmusk can you power a car off the oil of a man
3054 2018-06-25 17:47:38 Exactly. A stationary pipeline that allows oil to flow through it, or a pipeline that travels at 120kmh.... apparently environmentalists can see the difference
3055 2018-06-25 17:47:28 She's ONLY admitting she was wrong to call the Police, she DID call the Police, because her marijuana oil for pets business, that she runs out of her house, is being boycotted AND her suppliers are dropping her! #karmaisabitch
3056 2018-06-25 17:47:24 Election of the NDP did more to damage Alberta's economy that low oil prices. We have been through that before, but this is the first time we've had an incompetent, anti business gov't. . .
3057 2018-06-25 17:47:14 Yes both me and my husband have vapes with our CBD oil.  We live the Koi green apple and the watermelon ones.  We use 500mgs of it.  It's good with relaxation.  It helps my hubbys migraines some.  When he gets really stressed at work.  It helps to a certain point.
3058 2018-06-25 17:47:09 rUK is heavily dependent on North Sea oil and gas. The oil crises in the '60s and '70s is evidence of the importance for a country to have a stable domestic supply of oil, and gas. That's why rUK desperately needs to retain Scotland. Oil and gas is more than just about revenue.
3059 2018-06-25 17:47:09 That coconut body butter on a lassie gets me full pelt. but, no ladies do not put oil on your body to tan. Very dangerous!!
3060 2018-06-25 17:47:08 The oil they're about to recieve is about to be a madness though 
3061 2018-06-25 17:47:02 SHOPS and STORES should be given to igbo people too, and OIL blocks to south south people unless they will wreck havoc on the citizens of Nigeria.....

Just to add sanity to ur insane statement sir
3062 2018-06-25 17:46:53 So now Trump wants to screw up the Oceans that President Obama had protected against oil spills In our oceans.   Mr. Trump doesn’t care if it’s wrong. He hates ANYTHING President Obama did. Shame on that pathetic excuse of a human.

And no, the people of Maryland do not want oil rigs off our shores or anywhere near vulnerable Chesapeake Bay.

3206 2018-06-25 17:33:20 Are you having an issue with writing? Take your car to the shop on a busy day and be told you have to wait for 2-3 hours for an oil change. #forcedwriting #writerslife
3207 2018-06-25 17:33:18 Charlie enjoy Cortona. Stop by this olive oil producer. Nocentini. They are very close to you. They can pack up 5 liter cans for you and send to your home. You don't have to take him to the airport. Enjoy. 
3208 2018-06-25 17:33:10 "crop your memes when you screenshot them"..
Why don't you go change the oil in your neglected ass car lmao
3209 2018-06-25 17:33:03 Sunbathing, oil on, tunes blasting out n eating chicken nuggetssummer is what I live for
3210 2018-06-25 17:32:59 Like a big hose thing. You put oil in one end and it comes out of the other end. I bet an engineer could figure something out.
3211 2018-06-25 17:32:58 YOUR OIL IS IN. LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU WILL PICK UP OR IF YOU WANT IT SHIPPED. CHECK YOUR MESSENGER
3212 2018-06-25 17:32:58 さっきの人は悪い例で、
僕の同期は僕以外は皆2原とか上の人には内緒でやってたけど、同期にはやってるって言ってたし仕事に一切影響なかったからまぁいっかと放置してた
教えてくれる人もいたそうだし
あと、動画の時で他社の作監やってた人が同期にいたけど、天才ならいんじゃねって思ってた
3213 2018-06-25 17:32:54 Complete Rubbish. As one of the largest users of Aberdeen Airport those in the oil industry know that companies are actively cutting travel to London. Aberdeen needs a better airport not larger Heathrow.

3216 2018-06-25 17:32:37 Nothings better than showering, shaving and using coconut oil. I feel so silky smooth walking around smelling like an island breeze

3222 2018-06-25 17:32:07 @ucas_online I'm a recent PTDF scholar. I registered online but could not find information about oil and gas Economics. And that's what's i selected on ptdf scholarship
3223 2018-06-25 17:32:03 Not every provinces has millions of barrels under the earth, natural resources are non-renewable and will eventually run out, and some, especially fossil fuels, are bad for the environment. Decrease in oil price destroyed Alberta’s econamy, what will happen when oil runs out?
3224 2018-06-25 17:31:59 The Johnson's Baby Oil ad is priceless. "All natural, no sunscreens added." RIP Dan.
3225 2018-06-25 17:31:50 Ha ha, I told you, you're  on a roll today.

3228 2018-06-25 17:31:38 [IF] the euro is going lower. Eurozone is discounting in lackluster econ growth + the dollar has probably peaked in the short/medium term. Now a chance for EUR to surprise on the upside? Oil (Brent) higher (+$85) in my view.
3229 2018-06-25 17:31:34 That's wonderful.  You should never have to drive. Always someone by your side I pray. Thank you for being the messenger of God. Blessed all the land's you preach. With oil...Amen
3230 2018-06-25 17:31:31 Undo needed... Do not change!  I prefer that previous version of you.
3231 2018-06-25 17:31:21 Before BigPharma "made" the drug, others have had it for a very long time. Its called CBD oil. It doesn't come in a pill and made from synthetic, lab made ingredients. Its straight from the plant. You wouldn't buy powered milk, put in a jug with water and call it fresh would you?
3232 2018-06-25 17:31:21 I have this essential oil I like to sniff to help with headache woes. It’s full of eucalyptus and other pungent things. Wakes you right up anytime you need a jolt, too.
3233 2018-06-25 17:31:14 I be scared to get my oil changed 
3234 2018-06-25 17:31:10 You are a threat to the Trump administration.

3238 2018-06-25 17:30:36 Not true, 83% of all minors were unaccompanied. Their parents sent them across a dangerous desert trek by themselves with known sex traffickers. Using them for chain migration. Disgusting truth is hard.
3239 2018-06-25 17:30:14 they didn't stage a coup in nazi germany like they did in say, iran, syria, chile, etc. etc. etc.

also, y'know, people trying to nationalize their oil industry aren't nazis
3240 2018-06-25 17:30:08 My morning:
Oil Change
Check the mail
Get passed illegally and the cop behind the guy did NOTHING. 
Sit at the green light twice and watch people run the red light. 
Nearly t-bone someone when they cut me off. 
I'm staying home the rest of the day. I don't want to get killed.
3241 2018-06-25 17:29:59 One of the incentives to change my own oil and do whatever other routine maintenance I can, other than the satisfaction, is that I get to pick the music in my own garage.
3242 2018-06-25 17:29:56 I know the struggle man. Ive been doing all kinds of different regiments throughout my life. Heres a big tip, when you arent reaching your calories, throw in some healthy fats, like avocado or coconut oil. Youre looking at like a solid 200 or so calories of healthy fats.
3243 2018-06-25 17:29:52 @osmo_uk Is there much difference between your decking oil and polyx-oil uv. I was intending to use some left over uv on some decking, what are the negatives?
3244 2018-06-25 17:29:34 @realDonaldTrump because of you and your vows humanity will fall. Stay away from our national parks and forests. You all profit from your oil and coal when there are new forms of energy you could be investing in. all your money won't mean squat when there is no planet to live on.
3245 2018-06-25 17:29:30 If J.A. Happ can contain the red-hot Houston Astros this evening, in their own backyard, the #BlueJays would be wise to look at moving him prior to his next start.
3246 2018-06-25 17:29:30 The law will be waved. DJT was quoted saying "To be the best you gotta beat the best so Imma let Vivek run and I will grab him by the pussy and make him my little binky boy." He then started pelvic thrusting while screaming "THIS IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO TO VIVEK"
3247 2018-06-25 17:29:27 Because his mandate infringed on their civil liberties.  Good for them for fighting back.
3248 2018-06-25 17:29:20 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
3249 2018-06-25 17:29:13 my mom basically put a whole handful of vaseline into my hair after watching a beauty video on YT, needless to say it took me 2 days and a lot of experiementing to wash it out  COCONUT OIL IS MEANT TO FIX EVERYTHING ! 
3250 2018-06-25 17:29:12 What a gorgeous fish. Filet it and fry it, get the potatos and onions and oil. Yum.
3251 2018-06-25 17:29:09 Neck Oil is a good choice, becoming more common on tap in pubs now too
3252 2018-06-25 17:29:04 No ones arguing against renewables. But its obvious oil still has a dominant place in our society for probably another 20 years and after that will be atleast another 20 years of transitioning. And thats only considering energy nevermind manufacturing which will live on forever
3253 2018-06-25 17:28:55 And the more oil released into the soil and ground water.  #daplalternativefacts
3254 2018-06-25 17:28:47 If anyone thinks they are going to answer any questions of value, I have some snake oil to sell you.

3256 2018-06-25 17:28:27 Also, Gemma is lucky I love her because her oil is expensive af.
3257 2018-06-25 17:27:53 Need to invest in some black seed oil
3258 2018-06-25 17:27:53 Aye, Ibeauty off capital Blvd in Raleigh has wild growth oil 2 for $10. You’re welcome
3259 2018-06-25 17:27:47 For some time, it wasn't clear what would hit first, peak oil or climate breakdown. Now it's clear that climate breakdown is "winning." As a physicist, I'd frame it as a radiative transfer problem!
3260 2018-06-25 17:27:43 Is coconut carrier oil also a Tropical treatment?
3261 2018-06-25 17:27:37 Smashbox primer oil, Marc Anthony dream waves beach spray, and Briogeo Rasarco Milk leave in conditioning spray ! 
3262 2018-06-25 17:27:36 Honestly I'm liking my suave avocado+olive oil shampoo and conditioner plus garnier sleek & shine Moroccan treatment. (But my hair tends dry as FUCK and can't hold a curl worth a damn. So. xD)

3274 2018-06-25 17:26:39 WOA! That's $3.99 a gallon  if it was American gas maybe not mind but paying those prices for foreign oil??? Cheaper to produce it here at home!!!

3278 2018-06-25 17:26:14 While you stock up on Murphy oil for your staircase wit, you should consider a jug of Johnny-on-the-spot remover to deal with me.

3289 2018-06-25 17:25:26 You’re missing the very important fact that oil provides fuel for heating, for transportation, for medical procedures and also for new technology. There is no possible way that oil will be reduced that significantly in 2 years. Too much  being earned...

But her idiotic progeny shouts ‘democracy is in danger’ If oil soars by few paise they keep bombarding but overlook 30%power hike by Karnataka Electricity Board coolly
3303 2018-06-25 17:23:54 well then . . . you’re mighty dirty on the outside. Make your papa FRED proud, back your snake oil ppl up!!!
3304 2018-06-25 17:23:53 If Scotland had been independent, it could've set its own oil & gas taxation policies, retained interests in every production licence & established a state-owned oil company, like Norway. Hydro electric isn't oil,but Norway managed to invest in hydro as a small self-ruled country
3305 2018-06-25 17:23:53 Being daughter to a mechanic allows for excessively informed decisions when they try to add on services at an oil change spot

3307 2018-06-25 17:23:43 I think it’s weird that I get a call on my phone everytime I need an oil change. Like how tf y’all know.
3308 2018-06-25 17:23:41 Some days I wish I knew how to fix my own car.  my bank account is hurting after this oil change, new water pump, and a new tension pulley.

3327 2018-06-25 17:21:05 I am of the opinion that our military is stretched from guarding oil blocks, fighting insurgency, fighting crime and doing the police’s job, being a tool or oppression and human rights abuse. All this while without strategy, using conventional military tactics...
3328 2018-06-25 17:21:04 You take their lands to build Estates, Oil wells, Ranches, Schools they can't afford, tag them rogues for asking for compensation and have the security operatives harass and assault them. This is Nigeria
3329 2018-06-25 17:21:04 ESPN Magazine BODY11 Issue is going to feature ZE standing out in the stirrup with slack pulled wide.

mom: wow adulting is really kicking you in the butt huh
3332 2018-06-25 17:20:53 So. Who's going to get their oil?
3333 2018-06-25 17:20:49 LOL, imagine the outrage if it did. By the way, maybe people should start pulling the same stunt on Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Liz Warren, etc.. Let's see how well that goes over.
3334 2018-06-25 17:20:30 I did that drive with my last job for over 3 years. I like to drive but the oil changes and tires got to be too much. Have you looked in the Jupiter area?
3335 2018-06-25 17:20:27 Was told by one in the know that one of the main culprits of the gulf oil crisis was caused by a Mexican so rich no one even knows of him except those in servitude to him...I think he had huge stock holdings in a company called nalco which was purchased a few months later by
3336 2018-06-25 17:20:12 Lavender oil's my go to. And those really expensive dead sea salts 
3337 2018-06-25 17:20:09 P:E's are getting too high in equities as well. What's scary is that the Fed's toolbox is bare for affecting monetary policy. Rates are still too low and inflation is non-existent outside of oil prices.
3338 2018-06-25 17:20:08 We actually almost suffocated on fumes because we thought the oil was supposed to bubble and didn't violantly react with water smh
3339 2018-06-25 17:20:06 Did my first oil change on my Charger 
3340 2018-06-25 17:20:02 talk about tankers, whilst playing with his Lilly, I would have said dick myself attach to his head

3347 2018-06-25 17:19:22 Because he’s always taking days off while we’re in the middle of a trade war, a slumping economy, an inner provincial oil fight, etc...
That’s why there’s an impulse to call him out. He simply isn’t doing the job he was hired to do.
3348 2018-06-25 17:19:18 I need a hot oil treatment my shit so dry
3349 2018-06-25 17:19:13 On @republic now. Its live tweeting statements/videos from debate.  12+ such clips & statements in last 40 mins, from almost all speakers, EXCEPT Me. Why not post wht I said to oil company director @sambitswaraj abt how BJP destroyed Bengali's Durga temple in Kanpur in May 2018?

3355 2018-06-25 17:18:39 I think he's worth more to Isles, at $11-12 million AAV than the other teams interested. Isles make that investment back off-ice (not to mention under-paying him in recent years), If they were to lose him, team on-ice will slowly recover but it would be a big economic loss.
3356 2018-06-25 17:18:32 Got my oil change for free  now i can go out to eat
3357 2018-06-25 17:18:30 Somebody smell like oil glands
3358 2018-06-25 17:18:19 I have a jar of coconut oil that I have tried opening every few days for the past couple of weeks. I still have yet to open this jar. The coconut oil has defeated me.
3359 2018-06-25 17:18:15 And how is the electricity for these charging stations is generated? That's right, it's coal and heavy oil. You have achieved nothing.
3360 2018-06-25 17:18:03 Trump wasn't stupid.  Pruitt was appointed to the EPA to rot the agency from the inside.  This is the direction of Putin's world view...Oil rules everything.

3370 2018-06-25 17:17:02 Can....can I have that oil treatment?
3371 2018-06-25 17:16:57 You forgot: Now you can dump coal ash in the streams, lay oil pipelines in threatened watersheds, shoot grizzly cubs while they sleep, are you proud yet?
3372 2018-06-25 17:16:55 Yeah, Frk is really good, I actually didn’t think there was any chance of Detroit letting him go, just saw him on a list by the Oil Knight.
3373 2018-06-25 17:16:49 @Se_Railway Come on!!! It’s quicker to turn an oil tanker around than delayed trains at Cannon Street. You show absolutely no sense of urgency. I’m fed up having my time stolen by you lot, it’s now a daily occurrence.

3376 2018-06-25 17:16:39 Idk why I put coconut oil in my hair, I know better lol I washed it twice and still feel it
3377 2018-06-25 17:16:37 I agree there David...my base case for oil now is more or less a pullback to 65-67 then a run to test the May highs or higher into August, which basically tracks seasonal tendencies too. As for equities the Jan top wasn't convincing...would still like that higher divergent high!
3378 2018-06-25 17:16:31 got to admit, putting oil on my skin to help me tan didn’t work out as planned 
3379 2018-06-25 17:16:31 People who have protected sex doesn't that condom oil turn you off?
3380 2018-06-25 17:16:28 Very peaceful place for the oil drillers to work. Will cut down on their job stress. We all should get to work out in the wilderness destroying wildlife.
3381 2018-06-25 17:16:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
3382 2018-06-25 17:16:25 I am astounded that they frame hydrogenated COCONUT OIL to attack saturated fats aiming animals....
3383 2018-06-25 17:16:19 @bbc5live how can the SNP say about climate change at the same time claiming North Sea oil is there’s
3384 2018-06-25 17:16:17 @TexasTribune Nonpartisan? U had a hand in switching the state to the Republican Party. Bush, Bush, Perry, Cruz to name a few of the sellouts you supported; egotistical airheads. The poor misguided people of Texas deserve better, than a bunch of liars; oil rules.
3385 2018-06-25 17:16:15 Nati your skillset only grows and grows!! I LOVE the textures you're getting in here, it looks like an oil painting!! 
3386 2018-06-25 17:16:03 A lot of them are from South America running from gangs, murder and being forced into sex trafficking at age 8. The governments there have lost control. You don’t see America looking to help those countries, though, because they have no oil or commodities to offer

3388 2018-06-25 17:15:50 (but i think i need to try swapping out some of the olive oil for butter bc they are comically fragile, if i ever get the recipe right i'll post it somewhere)
3389 2018-06-25 17:15:48 boiling water is not, and will never be shit compared to the pain of an oil burn from a deep friar
3390 2018-06-25 17:15:46 Drink the rum, gimme the gin, and soak a few bay leaves in the vinegar overnight with some olive oil to make a simple vinaigrette

Dunno about the other 196 or so bay leaves though

3394 2018-06-25 17:15:34 1. Well done. You are absolutely awesome for hitting that milestone.

2. Wilko do a their own version on Bio Oil at about 1/3 of the price and works as well, if not better.

3. You fucking go girl. Well done :)
3395 2018-06-25 17:15:18 i had a weird dream i had a bounty on me and like  this one girl was gonna make me something idk but likr i tried coconut oil, coconut butter, stevia and cane in the raw idk why tho

3400 2018-06-25 17:15:00 Castor oil, sulfate free conditioner and shampoo, deep condition religiously. Two strand twist outs are your best friend. Eco-Styler and Creme of Nature Argon Oil edge control is the shit. Silk pillow cases, satin scarves, or silk bonnets will be your savior. Wash 2x week.
3401 2018-06-25 17:15:00 The truth is that Maduro is just a puppet of the military. Obviously the US wouldn't give a hoot about Venezuela if it wasn't so awash with oil, but so do Russia and China that have heavily invested there. Poor Venezuelans are between a rock and a hard place.
3402 2018-06-25 17:14:55 Remembering back to my first hearing if Jason Johnson, was back when we got Lucas Oil Racing tv a few years back (2012 I think) and that is who was winning most if not all the races for the ASCS series back then, that’s how I become a fan of his. Will never forget #41

3410 2018-06-25 17:13:29 Lol right, I can’t do anything to my hair. Wash and goes dry up and my hair get matted from sleeping on it I definitely oil my hair and everything. My hair just going through a thing rn.
3411 2018-06-25 17:13:22 It's important to have a hot pan and hot oil.
3412 2018-06-25 17:13:14 1. The country hasn’t been this divisive in an decades.

2. @RealAlexJones is a snake oil salesmen peddling irresponsible conspiracy theories to people who are too ignorant to do any actual research, and thus take his word as fact.
3413 2018-06-25 17:13:06 Went and got my oil changed and ended up spending 242.00. So that sums up how my day is going
3414 2018-06-25 17:13:04 A warm oil treatment will help too. Coconut oil and a plastic cap works great.
3415 2018-06-25 17:13:02 I hate getting an oil change with such a burning passion

but it’s worse when the man doing it is a cute 20-something
3416 2018-06-25 17:12:58 WTI oil at $69/barrel, +$0.47.
3417 2018-06-25 17:12:45 Well, we know what it's like to have a bunch of tech bros from out of town fill all the good restaurants and buy all the good beard oil. So we're backing the Timbers in this matchup with an aggressor from a nearby town.
3418 2018-06-25 17:12:41 The higher they go, the harder they fall. Let's see how high they get before mathematics tells us they'll fall. Oh and today's move down in stocks is making me feel like early February. An omen for oil. Me thinks the current daily fractal cycle lasts this week before a waterfall.
3419 2018-06-25 17:12:40 Need some caster oil like now.

3422 2018-06-25 17:12:35 But last time I got 50% off an oil change so like.... lol pretty good for a girl with no talent
3423 2018-06-25 17:12:32 We have the worlds largest oil capacity but we need more refinery's also natural gas and coal .build more infrastructure

3434 2018-06-25 17:11:15 Picked a good day to go get oil put in my car I think under the bonnet was a fucking oven 
3435 2018-06-25 17:10:56 Your number 2. though, care to highlight this "isolation".
Is it by dearth of key stakeholders from the "north"?
Limited oil infrastructure e.g. oil-tank farms, pipeline, oil "traders"?
3436 2018-06-25 17:10:56 For standard oil?

3440 2018-06-25 17:10:08 I know 2 families that have a child with RETS.  CBD oil has been a godsend for controlling seizures that their children suffer from.  Prior to Maine legalizing marijuana the complications that they had to go through to get it was heart (and bank) breaking to hear about.
3441 2018-06-25 17:10:05 just don't puke oil on  us....

3443 2018-06-25 17:10:00 My oil changes are so expensive I need to learn how to do it myself
3444 2018-06-25 17:09:55 You’re not looking far enough into the future. Look 20 to 40 years when the true cost of brexit is clear and we’ve finally rejoined. The difference being the U.K. wide psychological scars and resistance to future snake oil salesmen. You cant tell people but you can let them learn
3445 2018-06-25 17:09:51 Gonna make a poke bowl with a drizzle of weed oil and call it Poke, Mon. 
3446 2018-06-25 17:09:49 Oh no what’s up? Have you tried that CBD oil for pain - I dunno if it works perhaps add red wine.
3447 2018-06-25 17:09:44 No wonder, they won't give us our freedom.
The Oil industry is suddenly all systems go & it will help to ensure post-Brexit Britain will look forward to a healthy & wealthy future. and guess what the revenue is to go to the Eng chancellor & none 4 Scotland.
3448 2018-06-25 17:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
3449 2018-06-25 17:09:38 @CamileThai what kind of oil do you use for the stir-frys?
3450 2018-06-25 17:09:37 Would you actually date someone at that level of delusion? 
3451 2018-06-25 17:09:37 It's a crime against humanity in my mind. Purposefully or knowingly poisoning fellow human beings is criminal, period. We're making big mistakes re: ruining our environment as a cost of capitalism is NOT acceptable. Oceans are big problem too. Garbage patches, oil spills 
3452 2018-06-25 17:09:36 I do not doubt that for one....... minute.!
Just your Brand Name invokes terror on big oil.
Go forward, millions of us will purchase / lease your vehicles.

3457 2018-06-25 17:09:16 If by "oil," you mean petrochemical oils, absolutely yes, that would be worse. If plant-based oils, not so much. My understanding is that many bioplastics are a combination, but the industry is slowly shifting toward plant-based bioplastics.

3469 2018-06-25 17:08:30 Oh wow. Cool stuff. I would assume it did go up, unless the species contributing to the surge in imports are used more for oil, feed, fertilizer, etc.
3470 2018-06-25 17:08:06 I thought there were already a couple that had been ok'd. It was all in oil form though, with all the "active" ingredients.

3477 2018-06-25 17:07:34 Why defend oil trains? They are more dangerous, use more energy and congestion roadways at level crossings whereas pipelines don’t. How do you live without using energy products? Or are you simply an eco-hypocrite?
3478 2018-06-25 17:07:29 Will dump in price with equities but are we there yet? Not yet imho. Still looking for ATHs in equities. But I could be wrong. If I'm right, stocks go to new ATHs, Oil peaks ~76-78, then look out below.

3480 2018-06-25 17:07:04 Of course he did because everyone prefers richer oil companies and spending their weekends washing oil sludge off of penguins with dish soap.

3486 2018-06-25 17:06:19 A ONE-TIME $75 bonus. Meantime, many of us still suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, not to mention lung afflictions due to the oil wells on fire. I got denied my PTSD claim. Still VERY pissed about that! Tried to appeal but the VA screwed up the paperwork! 
3487 2018-06-25 17:06:01 Safe to say Oil Money was too much to outbid, how many Coaches in the picture now?
3488 2018-06-25 17:05:47 Realist quote I ever read: “People pray for the cake. God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, pan, & an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything in front of you, but how bad do you want it?
3489 2018-06-25 17:05:44 Yeah Manu!  What do you have to say about that?
3490 2018-06-25 17:05:43 ตอนปี1ไปขอพี่รหัสไว้7คน แต่ผ่านมา4ปี กูรักและเคารพอยู่เพียงคนเดียว พี่ที่แสนดีของน้องงง
3491 2018-06-25 17:05:25 Coming from North Sea oil?

3492 2018-06-25 17:05:16 I think so yeah - and that is just in small crappy cheap  local supermarket. Manchego cheese drizzled in Spanish olive oil with Spanish almonds and a white Spanish Rioja - yum!!
3493 2018-06-25 17:05:14 Ya Oil should snag him up
3494 2018-06-25 17:05:11 Don't believe her - she is loving what is happening to our supporters.  She is not on our side and she is not trying to stop what they are doing.  She would be doing it herself if Waters hadn't been doing it first.  Pelosi and Waters = oil and vinegar
3495 2018-06-25 17:04:55 @ItsJustDimples it’s an oil based product that I use to help speed up my detox process, it helps you pee more, sweat, use the bathroom to get rid of waste
3496 2018-06-25 17:04:52 .
Well that’s something to look at then.
It’s just not the default.
Those engines can run on cooking oil (if you can keep it liquid at -50°).
@VirginAtlantic was experimenting with some renewable fuel.
Wouldn’t condemn aviation as such rather work on a way to make it CO2 neutral.

3509 2018-06-25 17:03:30 Neither are corporations, when they go bankrupt, crash the stock market, spill oil they ask the gov i.e. you for bailouts...same thing, they are not using their money
3510 2018-06-25 17:03:28 Hmm. In this hot summer weather I’d run straight 50, dropping back to 40w when it cools down a bit. Oil is cheap, engines are expensive.

3529 2018-06-25 17:01:20 It‘s usually stored in some kind of oil, so the oil film is probably still there.

3537 2018-06-25 17:00:43 So delicious. I tend to use the oven at 90-100 fan for 2-3 hours or until they still have some plumpness in them. Scatttetsd with salt, pepper & dried oregano first. Then in a jar topped with light olive oil will keep for a few weeks.

3545 2018-06-25 17:00:13 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

3548 2018-06-25 16:59:52 I have much more respect for a coach that decides to handle tougher projects than one who goes to a team that has oil money and all they want to do is buy expensive players instead of develop.

3553 2018-06-25 16:59:40 For sure. She kept telling me how fat and unhealthy I was and maybe they would force me to have a better diet because they make orange oil leak out your arse if you eat too much fat. Spoiler alert. It didn’t magically make me eat better and fix my ED. Shocking, right?

3559 2018-06-25 16:59:14 Yup, and you know who still contrily the price of a barrel? OPEC!  We produce more oil, they stop to make the price go up! Talk about trade problems. Its all artificial pricing and if gas does go down ur state will raise the tax because u are use to paying thay much. 1776 why?
3560 2018-06-25 16:59:13 I just love coconut oil

3572 2018-06-25 16:58:21 They don’t understand fair.  Look at their leader he thinks cuts are the way to Alberta citizens hearts.  I know so many who like the oil would lose their jobs with those cuts

3588 2018-06-25 16:56:30 @ErikJetmir What is your position on the environment, particularly protecting the Chesapeake, resisting ocean drilling, fighting oil pipelines, and protecting/promoting renewable energy? I am concerned not to see any environmental statements on your website. TY!
3589 2018-06-25 16:56:25 It’s tanning oil that’s banned not fake tan
3590 2018-06-25 16:56:17 I don’t think a lot of people realize or understand this concept, perhaps it is a result of maturity (break things and move fast, Silicon Valley culture) or they just don’t care (out to sell snake oil). 

But I’ll explain.
3591 2018-06-25 16:56:13 TransCanada, Suncor, other large oil companies see the value in renewable energies. They are purchasing or investing in solar & wind technologies. Oil is a dinosaur technology & its future is dying

3593 2018-06-25 16:56:04 People in Surrey protest to the Environment Agency about oil drilling, then vote Tory. That's pretty far, I'd say.

3595 2018-06-25 16:55:53 Protecting the economic interests in Latin America has caused this blowback of people running to their oppressor; fruit, minerals, oil, etc., are the only concern.

3603 2018-06-25 16:54:55 It will greatly hurt american producers/exporters in the long run. Oil prices need to be supported right now to keep American producers profitable until the economies of scale can kick in. There are many other nuances but basically it takes power from OPEC and gives the US power

3606 2018-06-25 16:54:45 Just what our oceans need!  More oil spills.

3658 2018-06-25 16:49:18 The US is at a critical juncture in energy development. There are numerous pipelines and facilities about to come online that will ensure dominance in global energy (oil and gas) While more oil in the world may help American consumers in the short run...
3659 2018-06-25 16:49:13 The revenues of hajj and Umrah is replacing that of oil. Without hajj and Umrah #SaudiArabia will be iprovished country. The oil in the Gulf will run out  and they looking for alternative source. The're using the money of Hajj in their sinister war on #Yemen.

3693 2018-06-25 16:46:31 My uncle is a tree surgeon and landscape gardener. He hollows them out mixes old engine oil with some petrol and pours some down into the hollow. Leave it a while to soak into the wood deeper down. Then light it, it burns right down into the core. When you smash it up it's dead.
3694 2018-06-25 16:46:30 Yes - I really believe we can make a difference I don't use Advil or any sort for things like headaches- I instead use lavender oil, yoga poses to relieve cramps etc- we can be that change!

Soda is safer to drink than motor oil. Fact.

3710 2018-06-25 16:44:59 Well I think the point again is what individual behavior constitutes guilt? If I take a job working as a Nazi bureaucrat shifting coal from Silesia to central Germany am I responsible for the synthetic oil produced that drives their tanks.

3722 2018-06-25 16:44:05 Actually Philip we are also the troops, but our battlefield is Cyberspace (which is not a desert and does not contain oil).  For example, we're both veterans of the Great Flame Wars of 2014.

i have been testing a breakfast bar w/savoury oat/olive oil/rosemary crumbs and virtually unsweetened apricot filling, it is on reflection a bit complex for early in the morning but this sounds... fascinating
3744 2018-06-25 16:41:59 Exactly. We can’t afford to burn oil anymore.
3745 2018-06-25 16:41:55 I agree with all of that and somewhere in the neighbourhood of $10M is fine but not much more. That said, free agency obviously changes things.
3746 2018-06-25 16:41:53 The people has no job because of the regime that destroy our economy and use our oil money for arabs.and it was first an strike of grand bazaar of tehran because of collaps of rial,our money infront of dollar that become a big protest and brought people to streets.

3758 2018-06-25 16:40:24 When production costs drop to that extent. Jobs themselves will also diminish since they too are a production cost. You don't need workers when you have machine and you don't need oil refiners when you have cells that do it themselves. In this case income by producers SHOULD drop

3772 2018-06-25 16:39:13 You believe what CS Kiunjuri is saying? Get experts advice from major Shipping lines. Fertilizer vessel specialize on carrying fertilizer. Oil vessels only transport oil and sugar vessel carry sugar only. Let the CS  “ ndanganya toto “
3773 2018-06-25 16:39:05 This confuses us in center. Hillary's campaign bought dirt on Trump from a foreign agent, bought by FBI, basis for this investigation without verifying, and Jr is considered "colluding" for taking a meeting with possible dirt. Not illegal. How does this make sense to you?
3774 2018-06-25 16:39:01 If you could drill your own oil, you'd be able to ride them to the end of the World.
3775 2018-06-25 16:38:46 Lmfaooo, if you talk that cooking oil online you better get ready to fry offline mate 
3776 2018-06-25 16:38:42 Or even needing oil . . . an ultimately finite resource.
3777 2018-06-25 16:38:40 まぁ高いからな

3779 2018-06-25 16:38:34 I haven't voted yet! Which Dem candidate for gov in CO is most likely to stand up to oil and gas industry?  I've watched debates, read campaign websites, etc.  I want CO to move away from fracking!!  Not sure candidates get the urgency.  @MikeJohnstonCO @PolisForCO @CaryKennedy

3781 2018-06-25 16:38:11 Dear and Resptd Modji,   
In TN several  ancient temples  lacks  maintenance and  ther is no oil lamps in many temples due to funds shortage.   In  many  temples  sastries are trying for Rs.1500/-pm  but   govt is  pays Rs.20k to muslim maques.   Is it not unfair? pls do needful.
3782 2018-06-25 16:38:07 Well, he IS a businessman.  He's in the business of B.S. & conning.  Business is good when everyone wants to buy up his unlimited supply of Snake Oil.
3783 2018-06-25 16:38:01 Designer perfume Oil are getting sold out. Thanks to everyone who liked and Retweeted. Your work/business will not run down.
3784 2018-06-25 16:37:57 Never got back to reply yet...reminded me of my childhood...real bookworm in a cold house...1 fire. Seven of us. No gas or electricity. Lived in country, away from towns. 1 oil lamp and candles! Happy all the same.
3785 2018-06-25 16:37:50 That's still vague and optimistic. Yes, we have oil and other resources, but can we extract and exploit them at a profit? Your economic plan seems to be "We don't have any numbers but surely people will give us money because we have things..."
3786 2018-06-25 16:37:42 Drake: your hair smell like the tropics....

Me: Yes, I use the Cantu coconut curling cream with Argan oil and Shea butter 
3787 2018-06-25 16:37:41 Agreed on reserve asset. Except the Chinese who would use it to buy oil. And the KSA who would sell it to fund their economy, etc. 

If gold goes up 20x vs all other assets, gold owners will be fabulously wealthy. In terms of other assets.
3788 2018-06-25 16:37:41 Yg oil buat waterproof cuma ga suka bau nya:(

3789 2018-06-25 16:37:21 PSA: Changing the oil on a car that's low to the ground is a pain in the ass.

3796 2018-06-25 16:36:45 DfE made NO financial provision for that number, modelled expected use at 17% - about 3 hrs per day, assumed capital investment would equate to 45 KWh boiler minus cost of oil boiler
3797 2018-06-25 16:36:42 They were toxic together- like oil & water. I'm thrilled for how Well they co-parent now but odds are if they shared one roof it wouldn't be the same.
3798 2018-06-25 16:36:37 Metliculous about the oil. I thought my kids to tip well and work.
3799 2018-06-25 16:36:34 I'll take it...been called much worse ;)
3800 2018-06-25 16:36:23 The amount of oil on my face right now can fry a whole bunch of plantain.
3801 2018-06-25 16:36:23 I crave ramen or garlic oil, scrambled eggs with hot sauce or idk everything literally
3802 2018-06-25 16:36:18 Obama also used the IRS, FBI, & DOJ just ask @DineshDSouza  & the Tea Party.
3803 2018-06-25 16:36:18 I thought the idea was not to do things Obama did. I guess not. More of the same.

3808 2018-06-25 16:35:48 Oil and water don;t mix.
3809 2018-06-25 16:35:33 With a better team, he will play less and be asked to do things he hasn't really had to do with the Isles. IMO, he falls in and around the same area...that's not a $12M player.

3818 2018-06-25 16:34:46 I put them in my air fryer about 5 min then Shake it around and check till brown.  I think I use roughly 400 degree.   They come out perfect and no oil
3819 2018-06-25 16:34:43 Tea Tree oil is my go to. It works to relieve the itching and seems to dry everything up within a day or so. Added benefit of smelling like a hippie too.
3820 2018-06-25 16:34:42 Nothing says fun like super hot oil splashing onto your pal.
3821 2018-06-25 16:34:42 Belize is nice too.
3822 2018-06-25 16:34:42 I do feel your analysis for the oil and gas industry. I'm sure we'll see a trickle down as people try to use old material instead of buying new stuff because of the prices
3823 2018-06-25 16:34:35 Hahaha omg I love it
3824 2018-06-25 16:34:32 Yeah those oil rigs get pretty nuts. I'd recommend being a rich tycoon first.
3825 2018-06-25 16:34:25 Pretty much the deal Saudi Arabia has (except with buying oil of course)
3826 2018-06-25 16:34:23 I'm meeting a friend in a bit for some painting time. It's been years since I used oil paints. They're messy, but there are so many things you can do with them. So today's writer/illustrator prompt is TEXTURE. Think VanGogh.
3827 2018-06-25 16:34:07 You are so right. Was looking thru comments and it's just unbelievable there are ppl that can read and write but don't look at or care about real facts. Thank God I'm not a liberal. They are so nasty and hateful....true reflection of their hearts. #TrumpAlwaysWins

3833 2018-06-25 16:33:39 So China wd have to buy every ounce produced and half of the prior year’s to pay for its own oil, and oil producers would have to be willing to save every ounce paid to them. KSA can’t do that. Others even less likely to. Iran sells oil in € b/c it wants to use/save €.

RE: China's oil imports?  That's my EXACT point.  Gold/oil ratio must rise.  EU tried to upvalue gold to settle oil in 1970s

3870 2018-06-25 16:30:54 I remember reading that. It was a bit Bitcoin-esque. It is a reserve asset because you count on others wanting to own it. You prefer to own it vs €,£,¥,RMB, or other non-dollar assets. China’s annual oil imports are 50% higher than mkt value of global annual gold production.

3880 2018-06-25 16:30:15 Lol, you are thinking the 80s, not the 70s. Thev 70s were noted for stagflation, the OPEC oil crisis, making your own stuff (big DIY era), because no one could afford crap. Hence the "latch key kids" of the early 80s. Mom's ha d to go to work, now it's not a choice for most.

3885 2018-06-25 16:29:53 Snake oil salesmen
3886 2018-06-25 16:29:44 The words "and/or" as used in the ingredient statement, e.g. "vegetable oil (Corn, Cottonseed, High Oleic Soybean, And/Or Sunflower Oil)" means it may contain any of the oils or a blend of the oils listed. The type or blend of oil used varies based on market availability.
3887 2018-06-25 16:29:42 In all honesty, Tavares is a helluva player but I don't get why so many are talking about him as a $12M player. He will be 28 when next season starts & has a .93 PPG for his career. Simply do the math and you'll see we are talking about 75-85 pt player. Sorry, don't see it.
3888 2018-06-25 16:29:16 There is NOT a doubt in my mind! People die to get here....I believe the point is all we hear from the Left is how horrible and unjust our country is.
3889 2018-06-25 16:29:15 Y'know - I don't care - the only reason the hedge funds sharks were burning the midnight oil in their eyries in Canary Wharf was to do just that - make a killing. If they got their grasping, greedy fingers scorched - GOOD

3897 2018-06-25 16:28:12 Yeah but we have the Mounties. If Russia moved into a disputed part of the
 Arctic US might intervene if only to keep the NWP open and potential of oil. Can't imagine under any circumstance the US not coming to our aid if Russia tried to expand into Canada..not that far gone.

3908 2018-06-25 16:27:12 No I think the restaurant did that all on their own. News media didn’t help when they said owner was related to Meryl Streep. Dont care what you think, patrons shouldn’t be asked to leave  because u don’t agree. It’s called tolerance. Thought that’s what the left-stood for?

what a typical Kenyan goes through;
1. Tea Made from sugar with mercury, copper and lead elements
2. Cat meat made Samosa that was fried with oil from a transformer
3. Meat treated with formalin and carbon monoxide
4. Kuku injected with growth enzymes 
& more.

3926 2018-06-25 16:26:18 No, there’s a reason why Exxon and Shell are pushing #Hydrogen #FCEV and not #BEV - almost all hydrogen is made from fossil fuels and provides a last resort revenue stream for them as demand for oil threatens to decline.

3931 2018-06-25 16:25:53 The rest of the world will while the US clings to its oil idiocy. Most people only use their cars for local driving and commuting, those people could switch to electric or hybrid right now easily. 

And in terms of energy production, renewables now cost less then oil/coal/gas
3932 2018-06-25 16:25:26 HA! My mom use to give me pastillas McCoy when I was little. They loved how they made my cheeks look all red. Probably an allergic reaction to them but they thought I looked adorbs with my lil' rosey cheeks (tasted better than Cod Liver Oil). I def need somethin' though.

Thanks to the fly over country the US is in the top 3 of oil producers in the world. As a bonus, Texas for one has more wind turbines than you can count
3938 2018-06-25 16:24:57 He didn't "drag" them; they challenged a law. Funny how @realDonaldTrump, who's cheated on all three wives & had sex with a porn star & a Playmate weeks after his wife gave birth, pretends he's such a pious, religious man.

4001 2018-06-25 16:18:12 Of course, np  I take used coffee grounds after I make myself some coffee and mix it with brown sugar and coconut oil (you can also use olive oil). It’s optional but you can add an essential oil too like peppermint

4054 2018-06-25 16:13:41 But... we are angry, as Albertans. And without any party leading us to that anger.. We support a lot of people yet A LOT of people don't support us.. No support. Just false words and false hope. They don't want our oil but oddly drive themselves to their protests.
4055 2018-06-25 16:13:37 Why didn't they stop in Mexico?
4056 2018-06-25 16:13:28 yes!  you have the idea.  And honestly its all trial and error.  Playing around until you find that sweet spot 
Keep it up!!  And try the oil! (if you use water, only add a drop or two at a time and stir in between, it doesnt take much to water it down TOO much)
4057 2018-06-25 16:13:27 You outlasted me on the article front. Tapped out/finished at 2am.
Way to burn the midnight oil for love of the journalism.
4058 2018-06-25 16:13:27 And Quebec is not pressured to develop their natural resources b/c equalization means they can avoid doing the difficult things whilst taking our hard earned money & bitching at Albertans about how oil is dirty. And they block the pipelines & still expect the money
4059 2018-06-25 16:13:25 Spoon full of olive oil. Good luck!

4064 2018-06-25 16:12:53 I can't see any situation other than the world burning every last drop of oil and gas especially since most governments have  rejected any nuclear based solution. Even if we had viable alternative energy sources we would still use cheaper fossil fuels.

4066 2018-06-25 16:12:41 Not sure capsules are as good as the oil. Ward's on O'Connell St. €28 for 10ml. Higher strength available online only as far as I know
4067 2018-06-25 16:12:39 #NatalieLyn this isn’t your friend. She got you out here looking like the last woman to find out about Lusters Pink Oil moisturizer and missing the soul food marathon so she can promote her guns.. make this madness stop
4068 2018-06-25 16:12:33 Certainly we can use much less oil and recycle. Where the real problem is is all the plastic. The best recycling for much of it may be burning it in boilers for heating and electricity, or cement and asphalt.
4069 2018-06-25 16:12:28 Exactly. My husband was “laid off” by an oil co at 59.  Lay off became perm they hired new peopl at lower wages. He worked ther 25 y. Then new co aren’t interested in older workers. It’s cost effective for folks to have ins that covers pre existing cond & to hav subsidies if poor

4074 2018-06-25 16:11:58 Cheesy scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado slices and green tea with MCT oil and stevia 
4075 2018-06-25 16:11:56 Not sure how that affects it. In the end, to renmimbi-ize China’s oil imports off a USD trade surplus, China has to sell dollars for something, use the smthg (gold?) to pay for oil, and the oil seller has to sell the smthg to pay its costs, OR keep its reserves in smthg.

4087 2018-06-25 16:10:40 Smh. Our "governor" is at fault for 90% of the budget and educational troubles we have here in Oklahoma. Constant tax breaks for her Oil & Natural gas buddies, and the kids suffer. She's a damn embarrassment.
4088 2018-06-25 16:10:31 What is vague?  If KSA does not sell oil to China in CNY, they will lose sharee of the biggest & fastest growing mkt in the world.  Full stop.  In a commodity biz, you cannot afford to not be in biggest, fastest growing mkt.

4093 2018-06-25 16:10:08 Yet they will continue to invest in fracking, burning oil and gas and pumping more and more pollution into the atmosphere, the water courses and the seas. "Value" is not only measured in pounds. The government is corrupt; in the pockets of the oil companies.

4106 2018-06-25 16:09:05 From a finance perspective I believe we are entering a period of change where a gold related currency will replace USD for oil and commodity trades. This is inevitable. But it will be a good thing because we all suffer from the USD oil thing. It's behind so many wars.
4107 2018-06-25 16:09:00 In 2013, you were with the same leaders (read Raila) who have perennially hated on the Central Kenya people. As DP @WilliamsRuto sought peace with nyumba, you were busy plotting our downfall. Today, you want us to believe you! 2022 you will be a former MP. #Kitaeleweka

4189 2018-06-25 16:01:59 Because Ukips position is incoherent. Everyone from the founding fathers of the US to the Nazi party understood that political independence required control over primary economic resources. DO you have alot of rubber plantations in England?  Oil reserves? Bauxite?

4196 2018-06-25 16:01:24 @realDonaldTrump Mexicans sent home $26.1 billion from January to November 2017-Remittances are one of Mexico's top sources of foreign income, outpacing oil exports, which totaled $18.5 billion. - CNN. This is money not being spent, taxed or invested in our country. What's up?
4197 2018-06-25 16:01:22 Tesco’s cheapest works amazing but I do use oil a lot too.
4198 2018-06-25 16:01:21 Presumably, the bulk of the time from 2018-now, the net savings add to reserves from oil-exporting countries has been limited because of the low price vs budget costs. But because US has deficit, others are net savers. Doesn’t have to be oil sellers.
4199 2018-06-25 16:01:11 My 6 year old just called the oil on his fingers from his dinner 'pizza wet'.
4200 2018-06-25 16:01:09 Research suggests that safflower oil may provide some health benefits, especially for blood sugar, cholesterol, and skin inflammation.

4203 2018-06-25 16:00:55 Its about money. They've all been bought and paid for. To keep guns by nra, to keep people poor by vulture funds, to keep people sick by pharmaceuticals. To pollute the environment by oil companies. The list is endless.

4213 2018-06-25 16:00:34 I'm saying "If Saudi does not sell oil to China in CNY, Saudi will continue to lose market share to those who do."  There are enough exporters that will that KSA share in China will continue to fall, perhaps signif & OPEC says nearly 100% demand growth to come fr Asia next 25 yrs

4216 2018-06-25 16:00:09 Whatever tax benefit you received from the so-called tax cut are being eaten away by higher prices on tariff targets: steel, lumber, solar energy. And now because of the Iran fiasco, oil and gas prices are rising dramatically. #MAGA

4222 2018-06-25 15:59:29 @VelshiRuhle How can you talk about oil without mentioning climate change? The U.S. Government Accountability Office October report shows climate change could create up to $500 Billion in annual costs by 2050. This will affect individuals more than the cost of gas at the pump.
4223 2018-06-25 15:59:28 Saudi oil price just went up
4224 2018-06-25 15:59:25 U know I ain't have my anointing oil with me....
4225 2018-06-25 15:59:22 I understand now how snake oil salesmen made a living. There’s so many gullible people that believe everything they hear is true. 
4226 2018-06-25 15:59:18 Second time since I’ve been single that I’m going to get an oil change by myself.. let’s say a prayer that i don’t rack up another $150 oil change.
4227 2018-06-25 15:59:18 @VelshiRuhle What abt the Pollution problem & the Lack of investment in Green Energy along w/new Jobs & Cleaner Energy & Air not to mention no dependency on oil costs that's Ridiculous compared to Workers Americans earnings-What does Wealth consider Working Poor&what do Workers!
4228 2018-06-25 15:59:09 These man really let Saudi Arabia beat them ? A whole Saudi yeah, a country that only knows oil and oppression LOL, salah will quit and I will be happy for him. Shambles man. This team is the worst Iv seen this World Cup.
4229 2018-06-25 15:59:04 I am intimately aware of the concept of intermediate payment currency but what matters here is the use+savings of the recipient. Pay for oil in art, steel, silver, football tickets, in the end it has to end up in the currency/form of the savings asset.
4230 2018-06-25 15:58:55 "Uhweah," Gnar nods. He quickly fixes his ruffled fur, and then returns to banging tunes onto the oil drum.

To Gnar's credit, he eventually settles into something resembling music, even if it was a tad repetitive.

4233 2018-06-25 15:58:35 I think it was a Simple brand exfoliate that started the issues xD
90% sure it's an allergic reaction. Very red, and itchy around eyes. Coconut oil seems to help get the moisture back, so now I have to figure out what ingredient i'm allergic too
4234 2018-06-25 15:58:32 The squeaky wheel gets the oil...
4235 2018-06-25 15:58:32 A moat really? Yo Saudi Oil money is not going to last and splurging on turning one nation into an island is not worth the money. Besides I fail to see how this benefits Saudi business interests or even penalises Qatar who'll just get new coastal property out of your work.
4236 2018-06-25 15:58:27 For a freakin oil change? What else did they do!
4237 2018-06-25 15:58:24 I love you you oil merchants 
4238 2018-06-25 15:58:20 We need refining capabilities, oil by itself is of zero use without refining.
4239 2018-06-25 15:58:13 This is a ludicrous statement. Are we safer since invading Iraq, Afganistan, Libya and Syria? Our Armed Forces are making a killing for oil and weapons manufacturers but at a cost of importing terrorism, destabilizing the Middle East and creating millions of displaced people.
4240 2018-06-25 15:58:13 1. Financial responsibility / Olympic process

4247 2018-06-25 15:57:07 Do you really think KSA didn't ask the US to leave after the 1st Gulf War?  This isn't about "want".  US now producing its own oil, competing w/KSA, while China says "If you want to sell to us, sell in CNY."  Ties into my point: US can have strong USD, or shale, but not both.
4248 2018-06-25 15:57:01 It's mandatory. 

President Trump must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture......
Mexico as a country can't survive without US remittances.........

4250 2018-06-25 15:56:59 every time i get an oil change i embarrass myself and die a little more inside. yes i know how to open the hood usually just not right this very second
4251 2018-06-25 15:56:50 Thanks. The claim here is that KSA and others would sell oil to hold their resultant assets in RMB or gold. 

I don’t buy that for 2 reasons. 
1) KSA has costs. Those are SAR/USD-based. 
2) All remaining SWF/reserve assets need to be held in RMB or gold. Not happening soon.

4258 2018-06-25 15:55:57 I feel very productive today. I went to class, got an oil change, and I’m ready for work... and it’s still early in the day. Who am I?
4259 2018-06-25 15:55:54 Not surprised.  The worst car buying experience I ever had was with @CarShopGB.  The car was not as described, had received a full service, and yet had no oil, and had cigarette butts under the bonnet, etc, etc!
4260 2018-06-25 15:55:53 Castor oil is so good in everything..
4261 2018-06-25 15:55:44 How does one go about working in blockchain field? Oil and gas is boring to me now.
4262 2018-06-25 15:55:32 I feel like such an adult. I got my oil changed today before my car told me it desperately needed it.
4263 2018-06-25 15:55:30 Dulu pakai yang biru, tapi gak suka soalnya kaya berbusa gitu. Terus sekarang lagi coba yang oil. Awalnya kaya gak cocok gitu sih ada jerawat (nggak yakin juga gara-gara dia apa bukan) tapi coba lanjut aja dulu. Enak-enak aja kok dipakainya yang oil malah.
4264 2018-06-25 15:55:19 I use rose water, cucumber something water, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C oil and a moisturizer every day
4265 2018-06-25 15:55:07 Sir you are asking too much as if this is a saner clime. The leaders here are not conscientious and whatever happen to fellow citizens is not there concern as far as oil money keep flowing. Let us restructure this country and we will get to our desire destination
4266 2018-06-25 15:54:41 HERE'S AN IDEA: Instead of dabbing a balled up paper napkin all over your pizza to remove excess oil, take a piece of bread, scarpetta that shit, and give it to me
4267 2018-06-25 15:54:35 Do they only have 2 seasons? That makes me sad... lol

4278 2018-06-25 15:53:27 It's a Fact that in British Columbia and Alberta, that we have mitigations in place if there is a pipeline leak. The majority of people that live in BC prefer a pipeline to transport oil rather than by train.

4280 2018-06-25 15:53:17 This is all fun banter but in all seriousness, do u think SA going to abandon deal negotiated under Nixon in 70s (that you yourself have referenced), close all US military bases in SA, & then buy all their weapons & defense systems from Russia, just so they can sell oil in CNY?
4281 2018-06-25 15:53:13 But my question in the tweet is why they are tolerant of a political movement that is a cult that would kill them if ever in power? Why their underlying purpose for this tolerance.we know why they are intolerant to us ( oil and water) don't mix well.
4282 2018-06-25 15:53:00 The women on #theview just made a joke about a grown woman, who sells weed oil calling the police on a child. Why is that funny? @sunny @JoyVBehar @WhoopiGoldberg @MeghanMcCain @sarahaines  You do know the police will kill us with no questions asked. #SHAME

4285 2018-06-25 15:52:43 Canada should be manufacturing our own military equipment and refining our own oil . We need to be self sufficient instead of relying on the Americans .

You close the only oil refinery just as discoveries of oil are made in your country.

4317 2018-06-25 15:49:07 are we seriously still mining for new oil .. i cannot believe we live in such a technologically advanced world and yet clean energy is just SUCH A NON-OPTION

4323 2018-06-25 15:48:54 Your first problem was going to Pittsburgh.
4324 2018-06-25 15:48:54 Correct. With GST we're able to sustain RM without depending on oil. Right now we're not seeing any action taken. Unless opportunity for cronies to buy downfall market.

King George was trying to protect the Indigenous people of this land.
The colonists were trying to destroy them and take the oil...oops...the land.

It was never about taxation without representation.  It was about pure fucking evil and greed.

Pennyroyal oil is lethal in any dose, no matter how small. There is no antidote and stomach pumping won't help. Your organs will slowly fail and you will die. Period.
4330 2018-06-25 15:48:30 Getting an oil change & the man says “you need a new air filter there’s about half an animal in there” I said yeah I did hit a bunny once 
4331 2018-06-25 15:48:29 Oil isn’t hydrating so even tho oil skin LOVES oil (grape seed or jojoba would literally mimic your skins natural oils) it isn’t gonna help w dehydration. An eye cream (I like kiehls) would help but also adding a humectant in your masks would too
4332 2018-06-25 15:48:28 Got a bit of a blocked ear. Not sure weather to drop in olive oil, or listen to some Birtwistle.
4333 2018-06-25 15:48:16 Yes ! I use coconut oil to remove my makeup so that encourages eyelash growth. Took awhile but I just stick to mascara now even tho extensions look so beautiful 
4334 2018-06-25 15:48:15 Yang oil
4335 2018-06-25 15:48:07 Canola oil &amp flaxseed oil are some of the healthiest, omega 3 fatty acid rich oils that you can use.
4336 2018-06-25 15:48:02 I'm confused about 1-3. Didn't the government just buy an entire oil pipeline extension?

4342 2018-06-25 15:47:17 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!
4343 2018-06-25 15:47:15 Awww....little soy boy is going to cry!  Now go run and put some patchouli oil on yourself!  You’ll feel better soon!
4344 2018-06-25 15:47:13 Not allowed to have liquids in the sanctuary. Also, I don’t want the pastor to make me clean up the oil when I inevitably spill it.

4352 2018-06-25 15:46:05 No, I don't think they were.  And I think you are right that China will try to move to buy oil in CNY.  And SA may eventually do it.  
I'm just asking you who will protect SA when that happens.
4353 2018-06-25 15:46:05 Why have you reversed regulations to protect our oceans for oil spills?
4354 2018-06-25 15:46:00 no the point is, he obviously has no skills beyond snake oil sales man, and he ain't that great at that either.

4360 2018-06-25 15:45:09 That is so much crap. Open for business? Try and permit any major project in the oil industry. We just told investors that it would take 4 to 5 years to permit and an equal amount of time to build and 2 more years to start to create cash flow for a return. $1.6 billion to Texas.

4367 2018-06-25 15:45:01 Oil is not necessary, I find stirring periodically is just as effective if not more so. A quick rinse with water should be enough to get rid of the starch once it's cooked.
4368 2018-06-25 15:44:51 The “soul” of noise and air pollution, of leaky gaskets dripping oil onto the ground and into freshwater supplies? I am not sure what’s louder, a Lamborghini or the owners ego?

4461 2018-06-25 15:37:39 I luv the smell of tea tree oil.
4462 2018-06-25 15:37:32 Who wins an election in Nigeria is hinged on what religion he is which is why we always have to make sure both religions are represented regardless competence. Most tribes have a larger no of one religion, if we didn't have crude oil, we would find other resources to exploit.

4473 2018-06-25 15:36:55 The difference—as far as the superficial left cares—is that Obama had the decency to put real, systemic pressure on business from behind a veil erected by a complicit media. Trump just tweets his ish for everyone to see. Quelle horreur!
4474 2018-06-25 15:36:55 With all due respect @MBuhari please take any measure unconstitutional to make sure the herdsmen are labelled terrorists and the military commences operation real cattle ranch as well as create an oil colony in South #StoptheKillingsNow

4479 2018-06-25 15:36:38 My understanding is that all producers supplying palm oil to the EU market have to have their plantation certified according to RED, which enforces a deforestation ban.

4487 2018-06-25 15:35:47 If we had a wall they would never have constitutional rights in this country we need to have a 10 mile zone on this side of our wall where they still have no constitutional rights.
4488 2018-06-25 15:35:42 That seems really mean to snake oil salesmen.
4489 2018-06-25 15:35:34 he's an intellectual zero, a feckless foulup whose only talent is copying oil company press releases verbatim into bills and regulations
4490 2018-06-25 15:35:24 i have tanning oil on and i’m in the garden i swear if i don’t tan at all before thursday i’m gonna take a bath in fake tan
4491 2018-06-25 15:35:22 Exactly! Also, olive oil is fine but avoid vegetable oils
4492 2018-06-25 15:35:21 I have no words. I used to respect you and defended you against the “Climate Barbie” attacks.  But that has got to be the most idiotic statement I’ve heard in a while.  With our oil reserves, we should be paying LESS for gas than Americans, not more!  @fordnation is right.
4493 2018-06-25 15:35:20 A brightening facial mask, soft purple, with hibiscus, peacock oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. The bottle it comes in is clinical-looking.

4496 2018-06-25 15:35:07 They should drain the oil before he test drives so the engine ceases up on him ...
4497 2018-06-25 15:34:52 Very interesting... Between cows and human ? Which has more value ? This is what happens in a country where every system has failed and collapsed." Nigeria is sitting on a gun powder " you can not mix water & oil.
4498 2018-06-25 15:34:32 Don’t forget those $100+ oil changes LMAO
4499 2018-06-25 15:34:30 It’s funny how you conflate liberals and fascism. It’s like oil and water, but you’re the educated ones. Right? 
4500 2018-06-25 15:34:09 Well I put the oil in my skin care routine and prime my face over it and I use eye cream.. it think that’s what makes me look a lil more dewy. And after setting refresh w rose water but idk maybe that isn’t helping either. Ima investigate further and let you know my conclusions

Sebvah kegalauan
4505 2018-06-25 15:33:40 Just cut it into pieces, then put it in the pot, and the put salt and close the pot with the lid. Then you will later put cooking oil and anything as it is being cocked.
4506 2018-06-25 15:33:25 What detergent and oil are they using for that yield?? Mixing in small vats in washing machines or large tanks??
4507 2018-06-25 15:33:12 Free agent time.... Oil need to move some salary if possible. Lucic, Russell, Sekera, Kassian in that order if possible. Nothing against any of them. Reider or Zucker in would be nice. #HopeSpringsEternal #Oilers
4508 2018-06-25 15:33:11 The answer would be,
Obama held up the pipeline for so many years. Trump with swish of his little pen turned it around and got that pipeline going. But it now takes years to get the oil down to where it needs to be refined and stocked it doesn't happen in a day. BTW short answer
4509 2018-06-25 15:33:10 デザイン考えてるけどやばいな。。。
4510 2018-06-25 15:33:00 Hi Angela, Yes, failure to ovulate is very common among women these days, partly due to chronic stress, underweight, overtraining, hypothyroidism, autoimmunity & endocrine disruption from xenoestrogens (vegetable oil, soy, insecticides) and other ubiquitous environmental toxins.
4511 2018-06-25 15:32:59 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4512 2018-06-25 15:32:51 i am trying to SUFFOCATE myself with this eucalyptus oil
4513 2018-06-25 15:32:38 Yes. We are the worlds number one oil producer now & Houston is doing well. Thank you @realDonaldTrump  
This is the end of career politicians. We need strong leaders from here on out. No more pay for play crooked politicians.
4514 2018-06-25 15:32:28 M. Waters, this could backfire on you be very damaging to your seat. You're angry, I'm angry too.  On an oil drilling site, how do you blow out a well fire?
4515 2018-06-25 15:32:23 PM Modi expressed appreciation for ADNOC’s (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) decision to invest in upcoming US$ 44 bn 60 MMTPA (Million Metric Tonne Per Annum) greenfield mega refinery & petrochemicals complex in India & welcomed the signing of an MoU in this regard earlier today.
4516 2018-06-25 15:32:21 So far I’ve only tried out the Jason and the Argan oil one and I absolutely love it it makes my hair so soft and shiny!
4517 2018-06-25 15:32:13 Hahaha even baby oil isn’t working!
4518 2018-06-25 15:32:11 But, even with that brief comment, it sounds as if you would preferably avoid seed oils in any form be it oil in a jar or whole food. Am I right?
4519 2018-06-25 15:32:11 And when China settles oil trades in CNY, why wouldn’t the oil sellers immediately sell those CNY to buy other ccy-assets?
4520 2018-06-25 15:32:09 Snake Oil salesmen everywhere object to the comparison to Trump. Name one snake oil salesmen who ever extorted a country to submit to his demand for money to build a monument to himself by  grabbing children from other countries.
4521 2018-06-25 15:31:27 Got it off by ruining my shower. Haha. I tried hosing myself down in the yard but that didn't work. The glitter teamed up and spread everywhere. So just jumped in the shower. Also using coconut oil helped. Just be careful because your shower will get super slippery.
4522 2018-06-25 15:31:27 Though it grieves me to say so Thatcher was not I think as right wing as her children. But then she did have the benefit of North Sea Oil Revenue.

4537 2018-06-25 15:30:14 Put it on the bottom of your feet! That way it’s far away from you but it’ll still help. It’s a “hot” oil anyway so on the bottom of your feet is the best place otherwise it could burn your skin 
4538 2018-06-25 15:30:11 I’ve always gotten my oil changed right on time per vehicle requirements and unless service is really really bad, I tip 20% on just about everything.
4539 2018-06-25 15:30:10 Our addiction to oil needs to go the way of dinosaurs and coal, into the history books.
In the meantime, conserve.  And #RESIST the anti-environmental, archaic stance of the Trump regime regarding energy.

4615 2018-06-25 15:22:19 I oil my scalp with Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, and shea butter.

4630 2018-06-25 15:20:25 He called off an act for global warming saying that it doesn’t exist which it does extremely and he called off Obama’s act to stop oil spilling in the ocean
4631 2018-06-25 15:20:24 Alberta's oil sands bumped up the cost of steel, cement, tires and construction materials for all other sectors in other provinces when Harper was in power. It hurt manufacturing, construction, housing and raised municipal costs etc. He refused to meet with premiers!

4644 2018-06-25 15:19:01 Waiting on oil change and inspection of car was reading more on the hire of Delconte. They are extremely interesting hires.
4645 2018-06-25 15:19:01 I agree    tell it like it is they   drill from    our side of the  ocean  but  yet   charge us  huge tax  on    the   oil they drill   off our coasts
4646 2018-06-25 15:18:54 Don’t forget celebrities and the media
4647 2018-06-25 15:18:52 This has nothing to do with politics but rather oil and gas companies realizing that they are still capable of running with a reduced workforce and still be profitable. The fat has been trimmed and large amounts of office is not required anymore.
4648 2018-06-25 15:18:36 The joke is that the Oilers brought in Musil Jr, Lowe Jr, Simpson Jr, some I'm forgetting probably, and every ex Oil King they could get their hands on.  So when Oilers picked the son of an employee this draft people were laughing about it

4659 2018-06-25 15:17:16 I gave that dealership another chance today. All i can say is something needs to be done they are terrible. I waited in a line for 20 mins before i was told to change lanes to the full service lane. I was in the correct oil change lane and watched 7 cars go ahead of me.

Oil changed synthetic every 10k which takes 2 months. 
And I tip 20% if the service is ok. Real good service is 25 to 30 %. 
I buy an extra large Dunkin daily and give the guys $5 every day. They know I'll be there at 5am and have it waiting
4663 2018-06-25 15:16:12 try this for your own dressing: olive oil, balsamic, lemon juice, white pepper, wholegrain mustard and weirdly... a pinch of ground cumin.

4664 2018-06-25 15:16:08 Russia has already been trying to fabricate claims for oil deposits.  It will start slow at first but the erosion of Canadian sovereignty is inevitable without military backing.

4667 2018-06-25 15:15:54 As we have imported the 3rd world into the west, our sewage system & rivers are also used to dump rubbish.

4668 2018-06-25 15:15:50 Scott Pruitt is probably fencing US National Park Lands for GOP Investors to resell to their foreign backer, Russia. Through multiple shell companies J. Kushner is peddling mineral & oil/gas rich Native American Burial Lands to any greedy MEast pasha with $$
4669 2018-06-25 15:15:39 Re Adm. Norman's case is all about. Lib ministers like Sajiin, Leblanc, Brisson, Foote and Regan interfering in the process for pals Irving Oil.

4698 2018-06-25 15:12:29 A train derailment has spilled 230,000 gallons of crude oil into an Iowa river, resulting in a disaster declaration from the governor and a massive clean-up operation. The oil spilled into the swollen Little Rock River in Lyon County when 32 oil tanker cars derailed Friday.....
4699 2018-06-25 15:12:22 We create these monsters by paying them to destabilize regional governments. Their job is to create situations the US has "no choice" but to intervene in. The macro view shows basic disregard for sovereignty, international law and human life in pursuit of profit and oil control.
4700 2018-06-25 15:12:18 ....The train's operator @BNSFRailway said 14 of the derailed cars had leaked oil. Crews spent Saturday containing the spill and building a temporary road to move equipment to the crash site to make it easier to remove the piled-up train cars and advance the cleanup.

4735 2018-06-25 15:08:40 After shower don't towel dry. Bio oil so it locks the water in ur skin. Once dry apply lotion as per norm. Preferably Dove light absorption. Or fast absorption. Or the maroon intense repair for dry skin.  U get 2 for R80 at dischem.  Also drink water hydrate from inside-out
4736 2018-06-25 15:08:36 If youre looking for a meal on the healthier side, sautee different frozen veggies with pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, olive oil, and a tablespoon or two of soy sauce. Then add it with some thin spaghetti noodles. Tastes so good.

4739 2018-06-25 15:08:33 That's what perplexes me. Are immigrants even really the problem with the US?

They have made money off wars and misery and oil for so long. Maybe the need to recalibrate their business model as it's not working anymore

4742 2018-06-25 15:08:17 Yeah they need to start legall class of actions against people who have stolen Iranian oil dollars and invested in many houses, and lands in California, Toronto, & Vancouver including said reformer (progressive Iran to mullah land) whos f*king father and herself looted Iranians.

4744 2018-06-25 15:08:14 Nice to see Saudi using that oil money to pay the VAR refs for penalties cos they can't score a goal in open play... #EGY Let's put a few more past them!

4763 2018-06-25 15:06:52 wag ka magmoisurizer sa part na yan. kung may toner ka baka pwidi rin bawasan mo na rin dahil harsh ang chemicals ng toner. maybe consider aloe vera cleansers and moisturizer. dont use oil remover sheets. and less makeup :)

4767 2018-06-25 15:06:35 @dbongino  can i recommend to you FLAMEOUT fishoil from Biotest for inflammation, its my favorite fish oil; 2-3 doses a day 3 caps a serving. As well as Turmeric supplementation and Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and MSM.
4768 2018-06-25 15:06:10 They need a longer dipstick cuz theirs don’t reach the oil no more.
4769 2018-06-25 15:05:50 Making sure that employers pay good wages for jobs that there business can't operate without. Strong Unions to protect workers rights. And a government that actually cares about working people Not one that sells snake oil and empty promises.

4784 2018-06-25 15:04:02 I mean...I'm pretty sure the vagina would absorb cannabis oil pretty quickly right?. Although I'm making a weird connection between how butt chugging works and vags. Hmmm. Either way cleaning that out would be a pain.
4785 2018-06-25 15:04:01 So, I sprayed my catnip with a bug poison cause i didn't have no more neem oil to stop the aphids eating it.

They are trying to clean up an oil spill, stop flooding and last night they had an inch of rain piling up behind the temporary dikes
It's a mess.
4795 2018-06-25 15:02:43 Sana oil
4796 2018-06-25 15:02:27 Dont ever call something the best.   Especially from a chef you're paying lots to for shows.   It's a good recipe,  but why the canola oil? And  I like tomatoes in mine,  adds color and tastes like pico de gallo
4797 2018-06-25 15:02:18 Don't you have enough going on with rising oil prices, disgruntled G7 partners, and the child separation crisis to keep trying to undermine an investigation that you have no business interfering with? If you're innocent it will be shown. If not, then that too will be shown!

4819 2018-06-25 14:59:48 Well, it is a simplification. Just like we continue to use coal and oil today. Don't worry, your great-grandchildren will still be making a comfortable living extracting hydrocarbons.

4834 2018-06-25 14:58:37 We must first fix ours by bringing back everything Trump took away like pre-existing conditions, protecting the ocean from oil spills, everything Obama put in place, and impeach and prosecute Trump for crimes against humanity. #AmericaFirst #MAGA

4837 2018-06-25 14:58:25 Protecting our economy means stopping the Tarsands. It means stopping all investment in fossil fuels as they are going to be stranded assets and our economy will tank when the oil industry does if we continue to put all our eggs in that basket.

4871 2018-06-25 14:54:58 I give advice and help new folks get into software dev all the time, but I wonder if it'd be helpful to have a site/podcast or some resource to help navigate this point in your career where you're faced with management or midnight oil dev work the rest of your life.
4872 2018-06-25 14:54:56 I think you can make the argument in this case for failing upward (IE the monk misses the target, but manages to knock over an oil lamp that starts a fire and destroys all the enemies).
4873 2018-06-25 14:54:49 Weak second penalty, ref clearly on that oil money payroll ahahaha

4892 2018-06-25 14:52:17 Oh, you mean when Alberta’s economy booming?   Before the Great Recession.  Before the price of oil tanked.  Before Alberta’s debt was growing.  OK.

4899 2018-06-25 14:51:51 Seismic data interpretation for potential oil field
4900 2018-06-25 14:51:47 yes, that's true.  And the inability to earn foreign exchange by oil sales exacerbates that.

4915 2018-06-25 14:50:57 And olive oil? And organic ? And milk?
4916 2018-06-25 14:50:49 He for sure has 'something' to say... lol...... However, I can't deal with the screaming & snake oil sales... I get my conspiracy theories elsewhere 
4917 2018-06-25 14:50:46 I agree. Big Oil has definitely had the energy sector locked up for at least a century. Not good.We really need to find alternative with earnest effort. That said until we do i think it is equally bad to punish the use of what is available before real viable alternatives exist.

4919 2018-06-25 14:50:41 Reminds me of when tuna was packed in its own oil, only in reverse. Tuna was so much better growing up before the mercury worry drained it and substituted vegetable oil or water.

4927 2018-06-25 14:49:46 Yes. Works the same, but the difference is that coconut oil should not be used on face if you're acne-prone, it clogs pores.
4928 2018-06-25 14:49:42 I do not know how much grants, loans, subsidies, and “corporate welfare”, if any, has been provided to the oil and gas industry.  Please provide a breakdown for us all so what you say is backed by fact rather than just innuendo and rumour.

4938 2018-06-25 14:48:34 Is that a serious question? We have the largest military by a LONG shot and are subsequently one of the most forceful and active imperialist nations. We start wars and destabilize governments just to gain access to oil, Venezuala and Iraq beung just 2 recent examples.

- Trade between Provinces
- Funding anti oil activism but buying out pipeline
- Funding certain religious groups while obstructing established others

4991 2018-06-25 14:41:33 Alberta has the best economic numbers in the country, the highest wages and still Albertans constantly whine. When global oil prices inevitably go down the whining is unbearable.
Btw Alberta gets more in federal transfers then they get from the o&g sector. Entitlement indeed.

4998 2018-06-25 14:40:25 There's nothing new or original in confronting politicians. Those snake oil salesman usually had to be confronted at thier offices, or by phone or mail. 

Let the people get in thier faces I say.  This is how the public can lobby them since they don't have millions to offer.

5025 2018-06-25 14:37:43 I’m a Millennial (even tho I’d hate to admit it) I get my oil changed every 5k miles and I tio over 20% but I’m also a bartender so I get it. Most bad tips I get are from older people not millennials
5026 2018-06-25 14:37:42 @junior_miller You mentioned the large oil companies fighting the battery-powered autonomous car future. Their best way to adapt is to begin designing their own batteries, etc. which @BP, @Exxon, and @Shell already do.

5031 2018-06-25 14:37:08 For decades the US has tried to achieve low oil prices and OPEC tried to push up the oil price. Now the table has turned as the US is hoping for a much higher price and OPEC is trying to lower it. What a change.#OOTT
5032 2018-06-25 14:37:00 Gas won because more $ were put into oil and gas explorations and not into electric car innovations. The electric car tech has hit the market.
5033 2018-06-25 14:36:56 @KittenHoliday I have used a blender every morning for my Bulletproof coffee and I don't have this problem.

What setting are you using?  The lowest speed works fine to mix the butter/MCT oil.

5037 2018-06-25 14:36:36 Shameless product plug: Perfect Formula Daily Moisture cuticle oil. Yesterday my cuticles looked like shredded paper. Used the oil and there is marked improvement today. Going at this rate, my nails should look like a hand model's by tomorrow.
5038 2018-06-25 14:36:35 How much of Saturday’s meeting is simply posturing to placate oil consuming countries versus what was said on Friday? I still believe 600k bpd is the real increase but open to hear different views.
5039 2018-06-25 14:36:10 I’ve put undiluted lavender oil on them as well as taking antihistamine. It’s not making that much difference

5043 2018-06-25 14:35:22 yes, I just make sure the oil doesn't spill on my dress.

5055 2018-06-25 14:34:24 Every 3 months for an oil change and as for tipping anywhere from $8-$20 each time. Which is always more than 20% when we go out to eat...BUT I lower the tip each time the server ticks me off. I’ve been a waitress too...sometimes there is no excuse for bad service.
5056 2018-06-25 14:34:20 Gimme a freakin break. This is why there's no talking to you people. Show me all your tweets bitching about Obama favoring Russian, Iran and Syria, among others, over our allies, and he spent plenty on his vacations. The oil thing and the Nazi bs only shows how clueless you are.

5065 2018-06-25 14:33:26 We're just so hypocritical in this country, the #ZamfaraMassacre never got any media relevance like the less killings that happened in #JoS why? Because Muslims are at d receiving end.
5066 2018-06-25 14:33:00 Pretty sure coconut oil has seeped its way into my blood stream and DNA.
5067 2018-06-25 14:32:09 Because he sold the Palestinians for stolen oil from the Golan? Or for supporting IS?
5068 2018-06-25 14:32:04 My scalp is really dry, tight, itchy and flaky.

I decided to mix a brown sugar, tea tree oil and castor oil scrub for my scalp.

I part my hair and and rub the the exfoliator on my scalp, paying close attention to my problem areas.
5069 2018-06-25 14:32:01 The way blood in flowing in the land would leave you thinking it's the new crude oil & we need it for our sustenance.

We've completely lost our collective humanity....

5072 2018-06-25 14:31:48 If you really mean reciprocity, than I agree strongly with you. What you can't do is to insist other countries to facilitate the entrance of US good, while the US maintains its own barriers. I'm sick of my country trading a ship of oil for a canoe of gas...

5096 2018-06-25 14:29:18 Therefore, as higher oil prices seep into core inflation — exacerbated by other inflationary forces such as wage growth and tariffs on items such as aluminum and steel — they have the potential to cause the Fed to get more aggressive in its rate hikes.

5111 2018-06-25 14:27:35 Aaron, Tories take a bar of gold & value it, they then add value by printing money many times the value of the bar of gold based on it could be made priceless by a craftsman 

Oil is liquid gold, they just keep printing money to fund Zombies lifestyles, where is the expertise?

5119 2018-06-25 14:26:58 Its been encouraged by 44 years of conservative rule which has been propped up by a rigged voting system that gives more weight to votes for rural areas, and an oil industry. 

The NDP victory was a wake up call for many people and showed we aren't as homogenous as many think.
5120 2018-06-25 14:26:53 We have awful taxes, we have a $750 levy for the privilege of paying those taxes, we have a government who can only push us to $$$ ruin, we have no decent option to replace the govmt, we have a lot of oil but don't seem to benefit, & I take home less $$$ I used to. We have that.

5129 2018-06-25 14:26:07 Strong relationships are been between the oil and certain  sectors and industries — specifically, energy and transports. THen stocks in countries that import oil are hurt by higher oil prices, while stocks in countries that are export oil tend to rise on higher oil prices.

5144 2018-06-25 14:23:57 T he relationship between the price of oil and the global stock market has varied over time, having changed multiple times. There have been periods of positive correlation, negative correlation and relatively no correlation in the last three decades.
5145 2018-06-25 14:23:50 Your government bought a money pit of an oil pipeline at a ludicrous premium and now a bunch of American executives are collecting millions in bonuses. You have no high ground left to stand on.

5153 2018-06-25 14:23:23 Rump tasked then enabled Pruitt and others to do EXACTLY what they're doing. He's using his presidency for GAIN by giving large stock companies a boost, i.e. Oil/gas/shale/coal, Monsanto, big-chem, big-Pharma, etc. He's promised pardons to Pruitt, DeVos, etc so they're cutthroat.
5154 2018-06-25 14:23:17 In the past few weeks, the price of a barrel of oil has risen to its highest level in the last several years, and is poised to move higher. But how does that affect the stock market?
5155 2018-06-25 14:23:17 Chicken Oil is the best kind of oil to use. It's even better than olive oil. 

You can also head down to the olive garden and pick out your own olives from their garden!
5156 2018-06-25 14:23:16 .The context is the oil line running under or over what was once reservation land. Your job is to find out who sold reservation land to an oil company. I don't think you will like the result because it won't fit your view of the holy American Indian

5158 2018-06-25 14:23:08 Ozarka water at 7-11: $1.39/20 fl oz = $8.90/gal. 

Gas has the costs above, plus enormous capital outlays for exploration, drilling (avg offshore drilling rig $650m), refining, etc.  

And the price of gasoline is currently less than $2.50/gal taxes excluded. A modern miracle.

5161 2018-06-25 14:22:44 I left school in the 1980s. I was taught science using books that predicted that by the end of the millennium we would have run out of oil, run out of food and be entering a new ice age. They were wrong. "climate science" is not proven. No science ever is.

5198 2018-06-25 14:19:07 The fundamentals of Natural Gas production shows that if Shale oil production is to increase as expected, there would be even more glut of NG. There are not enough consumers and no infrastructure to compress it and transport it for export in short term.

5390 2018-06-25 13:58:30 That extra $2 on a tank becuse gas jumped up 15 cents is the most imposing $2 most of us see all week. I think it's because we see the price on signs every day, so we can follow it more closely.

5413 2018-06-25 13:55:40 To be fair 2017 was an awesome year for PMI data and world trade and a lot of that had to do with the rise in oil prices, so that rate of growth couldn't have kept up allowing he backdrop for some downside and then the Tariff talk kicked in

5433 2018-06-25 13:53:11 This has long been an impediment. Part of it comes down to immense expense and protracted depreciation scale for existing refineries that were put on ground to process imported oil. An Act of Congress would be helpful to spur accelerated pace of investment.

5442 2018-06-25 13:51:54 In all seriousness the outage at Syncrude will reduce light sweet synthetic crude oil supply and that’s probably why it’s so closely tied to WTI prices. It’s also a diluent for oil sands bitumen so there’s a chance WCS diffs could narrow

5451 2018-06-25 13:50:57 Because our government went from a people's government to a oppressive government.lots of $$$$ in jailing people.
Keep up the fear tactics,and to control the populist.
Plus hemp was taking over and the oil magnets didn't want that,so they filled the pockets to get their way.
5452 2018-06-25 13:50:22 The regular show just made a joke about getting oil from a place called Cornoilio. This is hysterical

This means, saving of 20 Billion Units - equivalent to 1.72 Million Tonnes of oil equivalent every year.  This will reduce the greenhouse gases by 16.2 Million Tonnes of CO2. (2/2)

5456 2018-06-25 13:49:33 The gas industry's attacks on federal and state methane leak regulations reduces the climate benefits of coal to gas switching and insures switching from oil to gas for transportation worsens climate impacts.

5519 2018-06-25 13:40:58 GP Mine had the old Mopar inline six. Damned thing was nearly indestructible. Only thing is, had to check the oil frequently because it leaked. Not a lot, but enough. Pretty sure it was a known issue on those. Other than that, great motor.
5520 2018-06-25 13:40:55 I agree Erik and it will bring home @anasalhajji message that oil quality matters. For now though also a question of stops on WTI/Brent spreads. Georisks and supply disruptions versus rising US production had created a false sense of security in being long Brent/short WTI

5542 2018-06-25 13:38:44 I don’t believe people don’t care. There is no such thing as getting rid of oil, like it or not. What are your shoes and clothes made of? The amount of leather available won’t cover need, for example. The amount of natural fibres is limited. I guess we run around naked and walk

5568 2018-06-25 13:35:37 This must be divested from oil & stop the west coast Pipeline leading to BCs west coast. 1 spill, of which no contingency plans exist nor can exist effectively & would leave a permanent dead zone in the Juan de Fuca/Georgia Straight. Recent harbour fuel spill showed this danger.

5570 2018-06-25 13:35:29 Thanks Ole. QU hit 1.75 already this morning. This ain't over yet. Looks like this is mostly about the heavy oil blendstock shortage. Syncrude is only part of it. Reduced exports from Venezuela are also crippling the market. (And people think oil SANCTIONS are a good idea?)

5578 2018-06-25 13:34:31 Trump actually needs to be *slapped*...

For what logical reason is he repealing Obama's order to protect oceans from oil spills & lifting the ban on importing body parts of elephants shot by trophy hunters?!?! I just don't get it.
5579 2018-06-25 13:34:28 The trick is to cook it with tomatoes and oil. Keeps it juicy and adds flavor. Toss some onions in there too.
5580 2018-06-25 13:34:11 My wife and I were talking about this a couple weeks ago. There's a HUGE demand for tradesmen.

5581 2018-06-25 13:34:08 I have also stopped and challenged my thoughts- I get in front of them. I take oil enriched baths to soothe my skin along with a glass of wine and soft music. I practice gratitude all day. Anxiety is real but I have learned that managing it is better than suffering from it. Peace
5582 2018-06-25 13:33:55 I've been advising young people to seek a trade skill. Mechanics, welders, A/C technicians, etc. are always in demand and make very good money!

Being $200K in debt with a worthless degree [and working in a coffee shop anyway] is a good way to destroy your life.
5583 2018-06-25 13:33:50 Not on mine they don’t  Olives should be stuffed with fabulous little things bathing in infused olive oil not molten hot lurking on pizzas waiting to be flicked off onto the plate.
5584 2018-06-25 13:33:50 But smaller than Germany and similar to France. We are and should remain an EU leader. Our economy was weaker in the past, and very different to the present day (King coal, N. Sea oil, Ships, Chemicals, Cars etc. etc.are long gone or going)

5586 2018-06-25 13:33:26 The oil doesn't get replaced?
5587 2018-06-25 13:33:24 That’s ace. I’d swerve the lettuce as I am a baby, but at that price that’s brilliant. Squirt of lemon, a bit of chilli and a splash of oil on plain pasta is one of my favourite five minute meals.
5588 2018-06-25 13:33:14 Will be a structural shortage of oil until 2020. See oilprice of 110$ at the end of the year.

5590 2018-06-25 13:32:47 3/3 it said. “Emissions from oil extraction, refining and distribution add another 25% to the CO2 emissions of a petrol car. Any fair analysis shows that vehicles like Teslas generate less CO2 than any comparable petrol car.”
5591 2018-06-25 13:32:44 OIL切った。もう一回上げてきそうだわ…。さすがにきついわー。

5594 2018-06-25 13:32:05 I went to the doctor this morning she felt all around my neck and face but found nothing wrong and said pain could be coming from the tooth I had out . Lots of wax in my right ear so use some olive oil drops then made apt for syringe next Monday to have them cleared

5602 2018-06-25 13:30:56 So I had to put another round of Neatsfoot Oil on this saddle before doing anything, after putting the dogs out and getting the little guy situated.  Then I had to check on a few other things including my bank account and reflect on my spending.  It is a time of transition.
5603 2018-06-25 13:30:55 "เสียงมึงแม่ง.." ขำนิดหน่อยกับท่าทางที่เปลี่ยนไปของคนตรงหน้า พลางทิ้งตัวลงนั่งกับพื้น

มือขาวยื่นไปจกพุงแมวแกล้งให้มันดิ้นๆ ก่อนจะเอี้ยวตัวไปหยิบซองขนมแมวเลียในลิ้นชักมายื่นให้เพื่อน

"ป้อนมันมะ?"
5604 2018-06-25 13:30:48 I change my oil religiously every 7500 miles on my diesel. One's vehicle is only as good as the maintenance it receivers. 
Tipping: I almost always tip 20%, if you get less than that from me you might need to find a different line of work 
5605 2018-06-25 13:30:17 It amazes me that flour, water, yeast, salt, a little sugar, and a little oil can make something so divine
5606 2018-06-25 13:30:16 High gas prices... Come to Canada to see that.
5607 2018-06-25 13:30:15 All the “natural” essential oil research I’ve done indicates that peppermint & lavender are natural fly & mosquito repellents. So, how do I go outside & empty a spray bottle solution of both literally ON the flies & those mofos aren’t even phased? Explícame.
5608 2018-06-25 13:30:12 friendship ended w/ the sun, now after sun and baby oil w/ aloe + vitamin e is my best friend
5609 2018-06-25 13:30:06 I currently ride in a saddle my grandpa gave me when I was 12 years old.  Because Neatsfoot Oil.
5610 2018-06-25 13:30:04 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar on weak risk appetite following ongoing global trade disputes coupled with oil importers' Dollar demand. Foreign banks' dollar buys and negative local equities weighed on the sentiment. However, Dollar index paring gains limited further fall.
5611 2018-06-25 13:30:02 สุดๆๆๆ
5612 2018-06-25 13:29:45 Had a 1990 Nissan D21 4X4 that was in the family for its whole life, just sold it recently to another guy, it had 335,000+ miles on the original engine with original seals, only changed the oil and plugs, still ran awesome when sold. Total tank.
5613 2018-06-25 13:29:43 That went through my mind only but you know what a freak about Neatsfoot Oil I am.
5614 2018-06-25 13:29:34 Government bond prices ended flat today. However, weakness in Rupee versus Dollar fuelled fears of FPI outflows in the Indian government debt market. Sharp rise in crude oil prices on Friday disrupted risk-appetite.
5615 2018-06-25 13:29:23 Lo que me molesta es que extienda esa descripción increíblemente simplista (y que muchos negacionistas usan como contraargumento porque, en realidad, queda petróleo bajo tierra para siglos al ritmo actual) de lo que es el peak oil.
5616 2018-06-25 13:29:22 ใข่ค่ะมันมีจริงๆ 
5617 2018-06-25 13:29:02 Is there a reason to hear up the pan before you pour oil in???
5618 2018-06-25 13:28:47 In case any of you think I'm a supporter of Bashar Al Assad or Lebanon's Leaders, you must be deluded or mistaken.

My issue with Assad is exactly same with Lebanese Leaders.

I feel betrayed they all hid from Syrians & Lebanese - we had huge Oil & Gas since knowing it in 1978.
5619 2018-06-25 13:28:38 The only “lube” I can use is organic coconut oil ... I just watched a bitch pour damn near a whole bottle of baby oil on her pussy  I damn near started itching just looking at it 
5620 2018-06-25 13:28:35 Unfortunately this is not big news in America. It would only be in the news if a white person knocked the oil out of a black persons hands to cause the oil spill. That’s American News in a nutshell! It’s a giant load of shit 24/7 
5621 2018-06-25 13:28:23 So yes I did too put Neatsfoot Oil on it which changed the color.  First of all, I like a dark saddle.  I have never been into that lighter-colored leather.

5623 2018-06-25 13:28:16 To be specific, jam is always near Uttam sagar hotel junction (old police stn) and near Indian oil petrol bank. Today jam and almost every other day was whole stretch from down manipal nursing home to channasnadra bridge from 8 am to 11.30 am.. pls depute from 8 am avoid jams
5624 2018-06-25 13:28:15 I do have a problem with fracking fluids as well, as some of them may be contaminating our groundwater due to leaking wells. That doesn't stop people from drilling for oil and gas.
5625 2018-06-25 13:28:10 cold weather + massage oil =

5628 2018-06-25 13:27:49 This saddle is not made of vintage leather which is annoying.  I am accustomed to working with vintage leather which is much better quality.  You can tell by the way the leather responds to Neatsfoot Oil if it's what I consider to be real leather.
5629 2018-06-25 13:27:45 They hiring black people to pose as their best friends now?! Lordt! She has a brand new Twitter account with that same photo as her profile pic. No self respecting black person who knows what pink oil is would do that
5630 2018-06-25 13:27:44 The open oil bottle makes me panic a little ;-)
5631 2018-06-25 13:27:44 Oil change: when my car tells me it’s time.

Unfortunately, you lacked the guts to tell President Buhari to stop the killings, probably because you collected millions of dollars from our oil for arms
5639 2018-06-25 13:26:42 actually most parts of crude oil aren't stable and degrade in contact with oxygen or microorganisms who eat them over time
5640 2018-06-25 13:26:38 This is what happens when you measure national wealth by GDP. According to World Bank economists Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa.... hogwash. A few rich oil producers allows multi millions to remain in poverty. Senior officials are failing the country.
5641 2018-06-25 13:26:36 The honey-turmeric-olive oil mask I made yesterday was great. Applying it with a blush brush made it an experience

Therefore, Nigerians know that...

5654 2018-06-25 13:24:04 That's because American chocolate is cheap. They use vegetable oil instead of cocoa oil when they blend it back together (hence the waxy texture).
They add the sugar to cover the flavor of the soybean oil.
5655 2018-06-25 13:24:02 Why would anyone drink motor oil anyway,  and who am I to believe?

5657 2018-06-25 13:23:44 Exactly my sentiment that Turkana people should never be hungry again. They have oil that can mitigate their ever looming food shortage disaster.  That’s exactly what I meant.

5675 2018-06-25 13:21:24 I think you need to look at the potential for retro status further down the line. For example, I am devastated I didn’t keep my orange gulf oil top years ago.

5677 2018-06-25 13:21:19 I’m currently waiting on an oil change & just helped an elderly man make coffee in a Keurig for the first time.

We’re now drinking our cups of joe and watching “Shark Tank” reruns in the waiting area, so my Monday is off to a great start.

5684 2018-06-25 13:20:06 He lobbied our government to keep pipelines out to protect his investments in trains carrying oil from N. Dakota. The man is about crony capitalism.
5685 2018-06-25 13:20:05 Apparently my car needed oil and a new tire. So I’m sitting in a tire shop, freezing, when I should be asleep.

5697 2018-06-25 13:18:20 The government now has control of the fate of the pipeline and a significant amount of oil export from Alberta.  In other words, Notleyand Justin are holding the strings. This will be a disaster for the oil industry in Alberta.

And I don't understand how this: “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.” 
...equates to "Famine"

5863 2018-06-25 12:56:32 The point is they blew right past resource rich Sask, for business friendly Alberta.... much more drilling done on west side of the border even at Lloyd, where there is plenty of conventional oil.   An area largely untapped until Sask Party came to power

5872 2018-06-25 12:55:51 Paraffin Oil was classified as "not a dangerous chemical" in 2014. In 2016 they changed their minds and it is now deadly by swallowing or getting it in airways 
5873 2018-06-25 12:55:50 Well, I use bloomfountain mangoe protein body wash. Red oil, Jack Sparrow Aloe Vera after wash. Cinderella snow flakes. And most importantly, I drink lots of water
5874 2018-06-25 12:55:43 6) Straighten it that's if I want sleek hair
7) Apply a hair oil
Voila 

My hair is naturally curly so I usually follow 1 & 2 and brush it through then I let it air dry tbh I don't use heat on it a lot

- regular trims
- Shampoo + condition often
- Deep condition once a week

5883 2018-06-25 12:54:43 We have just spoken to your service department and they said it is correct so no point in you looking into anything. £750 for a three year plan and all you were intending on doing was changing a bit of oil a few filters and looking at it. This is rip off britain again. Not again.

5915 2018-06-25 12:50:36 I mentioned it more because of clip being used outside of it's original context. I entirely agreed with you on the use of oil based polymers. Particularly as I spend much of my time picking the discarded bags off the floor despite the reduction in numbers prompted by the bag fee.
5916 2018-06-25 12:50:32 That's what I figure too ($4.75M), but I've had plenty of Oil fans tell me 5+.
5917 2018-06-25 12:50:29 may have to try that! i use tea tree oil for everything too

5920 2018-06-25 12:50:07 Fair enough bro. But what does the drop in the stock market means to you? I'd say, with the current economic climate, oil price, and the forecasted quaterly fed hikes, I think it's time to shop for some stocks and wait for the index to return to its natural 1700 level. My 2 sen.

5) Use a hair dryer and brush it through until it's dry

6132 2018-06-25 12:22:47 The data is clear that climate change is real and that humanity is to blame. 95% of climate scientists have shown this.  The remaining 5% are paid by oil/gas/coal industry to disprove it. Oil/gas/coal don't want to lose money as we shift to renewable.

You've been conned by snake oil salesmen - try listening to people who know what's going on and report it honestly not the Daily Mail.
6172 2018-06-25 12:18:27 Pruitt is in bed with oil industry, lobbyists wrote tax bill, Trump and family personally benefits from their positions of power.  A new swamp in Washington.  Bumbling on trade and foreign policy will permanently diminish American influence. Only chaos, not reform.
6173 2018-06-25 12:18:15 It’s olive oil fried bread, I had it in Italy and it’s fine, just make sure you don’t burn it. 

But those eggs are burnt. You can call it “crispy” fried egg if you want, but for me, it’s burnt.
6174 2018-06-25 12:18:10 Why is anyone surprised??
All the oil money goes into the pockets of the already rich.. its an extremely divided  society.

6273 2018-06-25 12:04:30 They don't really like each other, adding another cat into the mix seems to be like pouring oil onto a fire.
6274 2018-06-25 12:04:15 You make the beginner’s mistake to not take decline rates into account and to believe everything oil ministers and oil companies CEOs say. Recipe for disaster if you ask me

"A bevy of angels descend from heaven and anoint me with cooking oil. Karl Marx kisses my beautiful ass. I time travel and end colonialism and imperialism, kill baby Hitler"

6277 2018-06-25 12:03:21 To stop Scots from ever knowing just how rich this country/nation really is that is why, They knew from day one that Scotland was extremely rich. Mind you we were a rich nation even without the oil and still are.
6278 2018-06-25 12:03:02 Arab women driving will add 90 billion to the economy. First of all,  no it won’t. Second of all, it’s just another life-threatening and risk-taking idea by the government. To make money. To sell oil. It could be just some college geek in Cambridge crunching numbers on Gas sales.
6279 2018-06-25 12:02:46 Trouble is, the picture you are showing contains a jar holding a dried and cured flower head that is so astonishingly easy to grow that they called it 'weed'.  When medical cannabis gets ok'd in UK & Ire it will come from a monopoly pharma outfit as a tincture or 'natural' oil.

6282 2018-06-25 12:02:36 Salmond lies about oil in 2014. Andrew Wilson himself has shown that. Salmond claimed oil was a bonus. It was ‘baked into’ the White Paper. You are all over the place here.
6283 2018-06-25 12:02:34 Yes , windfall of humongous Bank NPAs, Oil bonds, unfinished infrastructure projects and weak Government balance sheet.
6284 2018-06-25 12:02:32 Sayo: These sliced potatoes drenched in oil and coaded with salt. What kind of junk food is this?

6293 2018-06-25 12:00:39 But then he would have to defend taking healthcare protections from people, making it easier for companies to spill oil in our oceans again, and his corrupt cabinet.
6294 2018-06-25 12:00:26 Republic of Congo -- the newest member of #OPEC -- plans to boost oil production by 65% this year, its hydrocarbons minister said. The country, which only joined last week, pumped 291K b/d in 2017: BP data. @business by Elie Smith  #OOTT

6302 2018-06-25 11:59:34 I follow the recommendation for my car and change the oil every 6,000 miles. And I’m a millennial and I tip a minimum of 20%, usually 25% if the service is above and beyond.

6310 2018-06-25 11:57:23 Change oil between 3000-5000 miles.
6311 2018-06-25 11:57:18 I get my oil changed about every four thousand miles and as a former server, bartender, restaurant manager, I tip at the very least for horrible service 15%. Great service 25% or more.

6314 2018-06-25 11:56:54 I doubt it is coconut oil because organic oil will rot over time and turn into fatty acids which will literally corrode your machinery. For the same reason there are industry guidelines to not store organic oil in tankers for more than 6 months.

6318 2018-06-25 11:56:42 William Avery Rockefeller fathered numerous children with three women, and took the name Livingston after being indicted for rape in 1849. One of those children was John D. Rockefeller, who became the world's first billionaire after founding Standard Oil.

6320 2018-06-25 11:56:34 So this guy works in the daytime as a sales rep for a parts manufacturer; they largely make parts for oil and gas production. They buy bulk steel, mostly from US producers. So of course, I had to ask him his read on the current "trade war". His thoughts:

6330 2018-06-25 11:55:26 Rockefeller, aka "Dr. Livingston," aka "Devil Bill," traveled the country's back roads conning people into buying his "Rock Oil" tonic for cancer — "a useless mixture of laxative and petroleum that had no effect whatsoever,"

6334 2018-06-25 11:54:48 Accusing palm oil companies of having deforestation “links” is like accusing steakhouses of having links to butchery.
6335 2018-06-25 11:54:37 The most wonderful thing I overheard this weekend was that my favourite and best cafe in London @BoyceDaRoca are no longer serving their Oreo milkshake because Oreos have palm oil in. 


6336 2018-06-25 11:54:15 The emergence of China as a third force in global politics and economics is sapping the continent of its remaining oil wells. She is also supporting autocratic regimes all in a bid to make profit from their investments. -Ki-Zerbo

6338 2018-06-25 11:54:00 What is the meaning of snake oil salesman?

By extension, a snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is himself or herself a fraud, quack, charlatan, and the like.

Remind you of anyone?
6339 2018-06-25 11:53:44 Should be charged with sedition.  We have a political process to solve problems.  The squeaky wheel gets the oil, bitching method is un-American and repugnant to civilized behavior.

6344 2018-06-25 11:53:17 He is a #charlatan; I have saying so for months. A snake oil salesman and self-agrandising fraud who lies and lies...and lies. Your system of government needs a complete overhaul as it lends itself to exploitation by those who consider a dictatorship a viable option.

6346 2018-06-25 11:53:06 Well, you must have known Trudeau was going to be entirely spineless, inept and hypocritical on this file, while he locked in the predatory equalization 'formula'. PS: how are Ontario and Quebec 'have nots' and the oil producers so  clearly being raped?
6347 2018-06-25 11:53:02 y’all remember falling asleep watching B.E.T uncut and waking up to the white man preaching and selling prayer oil for 19.99
6348 2018-06-25 11:52:57 how much of OPEC’s decision to boost output stems from a desire to squeeze Iran? (more oil on the market, less need to buy Iranian oil).

“Fantastic, you do chips in vegetable oil?”
“No, they’re in dripping, but there’s no meat”
6355 2018-06-25 11:52:33 We have a couple already. Oil _is_ going to run out eventually. Bees _are_ dying. Sea levels rise.
6356 2018-06-25 11:52:28 I can't agree about the stock market, if you look at regional bourses and the current US China trade wars, as well as the slumping price of oil since the increase in supply a few weeks ago, we are no different than the world.

6361 2018-06-25 11:51:47 predicting the future of fuel was wide open to a number of alternatives. However, the oil industry succeeded in eliminating the competition yet again, this time by supporting the anti-alcohol movements and the formation of the Prohibition Party in 1869....
6362 2018-06-25 11:51:47 The bread just soaked up all that oil. So, no.
6363 2018-06-25 11:51:39 Lolll, the whole 3 episodes I was like “So, they just changed the oil they use, cool. Neat. Inspiring.”

6372 2018-06-25 11:49:53 Your tweet on Iran's revenge as American's unknowingly use Iranian oil arriving via Iraq reminded me that an even more dangerous irony (sweet crude revenge) might be the U.S. military dealing with China's jets/navy/tanks projecting power in Asia/Pacific fueled by U.S. oil.
6373 2018-06-25 11:49:34 unless they name names, it's fake news.  we've come to observe and understand this fact! (fact: a word that news media is unfamiliar with)
6374 2018-06-25 11:49:22 Wait..... the Pennsylvania pro frackers are saying Because of Pennsylvania America is energy independent....

But, Texas can you please stop increasing the cost of gas?

6403 2018-06-25 11:45:00 Oz exports oil to Singapore where it is refined and then exported back to Australia as product. Trade is trade and best left to the companies, not political morons.

Olive oil in others

6407 2018-06-25 11:43:46 There’s nothing like a good sprinting session in the morning to go and collect some oil paintings before school 
6408 2018-06-25 11:43:45 The entire @skincreamery range is incredible - specifically their face oil, daily moisturiser and clay face mask. Also, the @skoon_skincare ruby face mask.  I do also love the Vitamin C range from @TheBodyShopSA.
6409 2018-06-25 11:43:44 Only odd things I got were chili sauce (no cal shit) and soy sauce. Got olive oil and butter as well. Nigga, I'm ready to not be fat. The only thing I'm needing to check is my sisters spice cabinet.

6412 2018-06-25 11:43:16 How about the chemical weapons used by rebel alliance with support by USA and Allies just to gave their self permit for bombing innocence people in Syria just to gain oil, opium, and weapon test?
NY times under command by the badass evil like Trump never make credible news.
Shame
6413 2018-06-25 11:43:03 time for an oil change
6414 2018-06-25 11:42:59 Hey google is it a bad idea to throw hot oil straight down the drain? Totally didn’t already do it
6415 2018-06-25 11:42:54 Really interesting @CommonsScotAffs session at the @theogtc on how tech, gov support and collaboration will shape the oil&gas industry. Thanks to panelist Willie Reid of @UniStrathclyde for mentioning the thriving network of the @EIYPN !
6416 2018-06-25 11:42:53 I need a pool, a drink with an umbrella, a comfy sunbathing apparatus and some of the finest tanning oil - until then, fuck summer.
6417 2018-06-25 11:42:43 First I’m sorry to hear that. I hope you try oregano oil and black elderberry extract. Pray you feel better soon.  Secondly I wish I read this earlier to see your announcement you weren’t performing. Thanks for trying to keep the fans updated. You warned us.

6420 2018-06-25 11:41:46 USA sells 2 percent of GDP to Canada.  EU Mexico has a 60 billion trade deficit with USA - might want to learn to read your own stats.   USA has no choice but to clean this up.  Oh and Canada killed the oil sands its largest source of revenue.
6421 2018-06-25 11:41:46 Good show! Regarding food. I read labels when I shop and palm oil and glucose syrup (HFCS) seems to be in all prepared foods. I buy fresh and cook from scratch, its the only safe way to eat, now our garden is producing the fresh from the garden veg actually tastes like real food.
6422 2018-06-25 11:41:45 That's the very reason why we only sell the oil to America the democracy world leader.
6423 2018-06-25 11:41:45 Our defence minister is an unashamed bully. Our police chief is chasing vendettas while his gang of bandits rob citizens daily. Our army chief is a skin oil merchant. Our minister of interior has completely lost his head. Yet we wonder the reason for the festivals of blood.
6424 2018-06-25 11:41:26 OMG these asshole mechanics tried to charge me $300 for an oil change and an alignment. I might be relatively out of it, but I'm not that stupid.
6425 2018-06-25 11:41:26 Happened to me bro I used a oil type thing to soften it up and then i could hear again

6428 2018-06-25 11:40:06 I last drove a forklift in 1966 - does that count as experienced? Pallets were twice as big in those days. held 8 x 50 gallon oil drums (Empty).
6429 2018-06-25 11:39:54 2 mics, a cheese grater, a synth drum patch and a healthy dose of Lexicon Native. All it takes to make something sound like hundreds of different pitched oil drums. Which is cool.

6437 2018-06-25 11:38:10 It is this disengenuos, smug attitude that was the cause of my dropping my subscription to NR after 20 years. “Who me? I’m open minded, let’s dis cuss it seriously. Sorry. RW water carrying for the oil ndustry precludes it. If NR types were sincere they’d be pushing for nukes...
6438 2018-06-25 11:37:52 Lol, I supposed it was lucky that Peter Lougheed was elected just in time for the world oil crisis of the 70’s to bring Alberta to its modern day glory, but then again weren’t the NDP in Sask at the same time?
6439 2018-06-25 11:37:48 Al final sos un loro repetidor como todos los de Cambiemos, hablando de La Cámpora, el empleado público y saraza. Hasta el gas oil te subsidiamos maestro.

6440 2018-06-25 11:37:29 Wow. Flour + water + yeast + salt + oil + rosemary, very easy to make. So elitist. When I was in primary school (Italy), I took it to school every single day as snack, as did the majority of my little friends. We were so posh.

6447 2018-06-25 11:36:01 Whilst our financial services are a fraction of Singapore’s it is more than made up for by the the other industries you mention.  It is an absolute tragedy that we have so little to show for almost 50 years of oil production

6454 2018-06-25 11:34:34 Place the garlic in a blender, add some olive oil and blitz till a sloppy paste then spread on homemade pizza bases and bang them in the oven for some great garlic bread.
6455 2018-06-25 11:34:25 Notice that they “Empty the golden oil out of themselves.” In other words, they are to speak, or give out everything that the Lord has given them to proclaim. They are to hold nothing back. The last thing given concerning these Two Witnesses is in Verse 14.

6457 2018-06-25 11:34:16 You want see the results of your Presidents actions? Look at the hoardings around the pitch’s at the World Cup.. Gazprom. When he killed the Iran deal the price of oil shot up ... in the UK . He is the Manchurian candidate .
6458 2018-06-25 11:33:09 @juliemason @smerconish Today our great ally in the Middle East which we have so much in common with let women to drive for the first time in 100 years after its founding. Please remind me again what we have in common with Saudi Arabia? Oh yeah it’s the oil silly!
6459 2018-06-25 11:32:47 Most Chinese would use groundnut oil. Higher smoke point. If you overheat olive oil you ruin any health benefits you may have got from using it.

6464 2018-06-25 11:32:07 Right, as far as I can gather, they use the grape seed oil from the vines in the grounds of the hotel for the massage, then leave you with a glass of their white wine (which I have already tried and is EXCELLENT) when they're done. Yep.
6465 2018-06-25 11:32:01 @AldiUK a lot of your products have palm oil in them and there's no mention of it being from a sustainable palm oil source  any plans to ditch it or use sustainable source palm oil?

6475 2018-06-25 11:30:33 And we have a winner!  However we could have had a “Regional Investment Fund” based on a small percentage of our oil revenues which could have been used for post oil diversification.  Instead we got fuck all.

6483 2018-06-25 11:28:52 Does it not depend also on what we are willing to accept as the economic/social level of the rest of the world?

6543 2018-06-25 11:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
6544 2018-06-25 11:18:35 I regret not putting aside some of that oil down from sat night . Idk when I even fell asleep
6545 2018-06-25 11:18:31 Sunbathing so a put a bit of oil on then before a fucking know it I’ve got a family of little fly’s stuck to me
6546 2018-06-25 11:18:13 Almost like lying about WMDs in Iraq and then invading the country killing millions tearing down the political set up and eating all their oil and then saying oops we lied. And then still eat their oil. But what do I know 
6547 2018-06-25 11:18:09 But I believe aviation gobbles up 5m barrels of oil every day - how can that be sustainable? And causes air pollution from ultra fine particles. We all need to fly less and stop this devastation.
6548 2018-06-25 11:17:57 Wasn't a problem. If we remember the last laps of Sandown a few years back. Davison was spewing oil over Holdsworth's E63 windscreen. Kind of cost Erebus a possible 3rd place.
6549 2018-06-25 11:17:56 Nothing about essential oil of poppy?
6550 2018-06-25 11:17:51 think I'll hire a mini digger, put it in my back garden, say I'm prospecting for oil, and list on AIM like 88E, and see if I get 2p for a shed load of shares!  At least Ast has revenue, rebate, and GAS from both wells and more to come :)
6551 2018-06-25 11:17:08 My nigga lil metro got the hash oil I hit that shit I'm super high lol
6552 2018-06-25 11:16:08 Elizabeth, what u wrote reminded me of what I saw not long ago on tv. Some adventurers/archaeologists were investigating what some Bedouins were finding in the desert when they illegally dug @ night. One of the main things found were endless small oil lamps. They were everywhere.

When you inhale an essential oil, it remains in the the lining of your nostrils.

6561 2018-06-25 11:13:54 I mixed my leftover spicy corned beef, sesame oil, eggs, and all the other stuff in our cabinet and I dunno if I’m just hungry or this is the best omelette I’ve ever made 
6562 2018-06-25 11:13:48 This is not shaping up to be the Monday I was hoping to have.  US stock futures are off from 0.6% on the S&P to off 1% for the Nasdaq.  Markets in both Asia and Europe are lower by at or over 1%.  Oil is $68.49 with gold at $1,269.
6563 2018-06-25 11:13:43 Oil companies are a risky scheme that raise gas prices at the pump for all families just so big oil CEOs can own more politicians and get richer. Don't let big oil destroy our democracy or our planet. #ParisAgreement #ClimateAction #PoorPeoplesCampaign

6585 2018-06-25 11:09:46 Oh and it is a bonus, one thing I agree with the GC is take the revenue from the North Sea and save it. Do not use as the UK does to prop up current expenditure. As AS said oil is volatile, currently 12 dollars production value over 70 dollars a barrel. Don’t hear about that.
6586 2018-06-25 11:09:42 I accidentally clicked no and meant to click yes. I love Italian, Balsamic, or Olive oil with vinegar

6591 2018-06-25 11:08:56 Not making excuses for Obama at all, all US Presidents have been bad 4 decades. It's quite amazing how little history people know. Marine use of sonar's been going on in ocean esp. for oil long before O. Summers also worked under Clinton & 4 World Bank. But, I really don't care.

6621 2018-06-25 11:03:37 what about industrial accidents? I'm guessing we're preventing women from working on oil rigs or down mines. women don't have prostates but their is a fraction of the funding into that cancer than women specific cancer, where is the equality, Was Maggie a man then?

6630 2018-06-25 11:02:55 @ZN did say they will not announce the commercial viability of the oil at this stage and will wait till all the 5 key zones were fully tested and they might even extend the deadline to even longer to expand the testing to other zones. So that would give them buffer to delay.

6668 2018-06-25 10:56:30 Have not seen anyone whine about RFA. The broken promise is on the number of frigates, start dates etch no doubt you know that BAE have already paid off workers who were assured the broad shoulders of the Union would protect them. Note HMRC/Oil losses not replied to.

6673 2018-06-25 10:55:37 @TheRealMakori Yet KQ intends to hedge oil. The trend is that big producers don’t wish a higher price for now, for obvious reasons. 

Does KQ employ or engage economists for advice ?
6674 2018-06-25 10:55:32 - treating yellowing nails!!
If it’s due to fungus or bacterial infection, tea tree oil may be beneficial 
Another cause CAN be using dark nail polishes, so try and stick with something lighter

Your remnants will not remain! Just a fair warning. Won't need to call the police to report self-defense. I'll pour oil on you and burn your body immediately!
6679 2018-06-25 10:54:04 Oh you mean we still have oil? Yeah thought so, remind and tell your shit show of a party that next time they try and say we don't.

6682 2018-06-25 10:53:37 Still it's unwise to place them in way of harm. Those who brought the mullahs to power are solely tasked with removing them. I can't say I am keen to see more Iranian blood spilt over what is and has been an argument between the European oil giants and their Yankee cousins!
6683 2018-06-25 10:53:36 Your going to have to wonder what they put in your food. Not good business to threaten customers especially for a restaurant. Better not smell like a Trump supporter, that means don’t bathe for a week and wear tea tree oil for deodorant.

6687 2018-06-25 10:52:37 Dunno, 5% sounds about right to me. Problem is 0.01% of that 5% are *obnoxiously loud*.

I'd also argue a ton of "Climate deniers" actually believe climate change is happening, they simply don't care and it's in their interest not to (1%ers with their hands in oil, for example)

6805 2018-06-25 10:27:03 Wild plants could be at risk of extinction because of their use in cosmetics. Products containing shea butter and argan oil are among those highlighted as potentially unsustainable. Shea butter is collected from trees in the Sahel in Africa, argan oil from wild trees in Morocco.
6806 2018-06-25 10:26:51 We are no longer using NUTTELLA on or brownies..we are using an equally delicious alternative that doesn’t use PALM OIL..Gaz
6807 2018-06-25 10:26:44 We hear from Professor Paul de Leeuw of @RobertGordonUni that 'investment is returning as the oil price changes direction. As a result the supply chain will double by 2025'
6808 2018-06-25 10:26:40 - use honey to treat acne and oily skin, spread a thin layer, preferably raw, onto your face; let it dry for about 10 minutes, and rinse thoroughly with tepid water
- use aloe vera 
-jojoba oil
6809 2018-06-25 10:26:09 I'VE KNOWN THIS FOR A LONG TIME!! THEY ALSO REQUIRE 2 MORE QUARTS OF OIL TO RUN THAN A TYPICAL CAR!!

6821 2018-06-25 10:23:02 honestly, nikki showing her therapy session on #TotalDivas last night and describing therapy as an oil change for your soul was pretty rad
6822 2018-06-25 10:22:39 Forgive my ignorance but does oil not attract the sun and make you fry!!
6823 2018-06-25 10:22:33 Mostly olive oil personally. Butter, trex or stork professionally.. depends on what I need to make.

6825 2018-06-25 10:21:53 - use a gentle facial cleanser twice a day 
- use a toner free of alcohol or acetone 
- moisturise your skin 
- use blotting papers 
- use a clay mask 
- apply an oil free, mineral powder makeup base for the daytime
6826 2018-06-25 10:21:37 @Morning_Joe A segment on the NBC news last night dealt with Louisiana crawfishers who said the oil pipelines that are going in are destroying the swamp that the crawfish need to breed. They are all Trump voters who thought he would help them. They want Pruitt/Trump to come down!

6832 2018-06-25 10:19:43 I don't wanna go play with my acrylic paints tbh. I always feel like I'm wasting paint. But then again... I don't ever want to use oil paint again. I got intoxicated when I was 12 because I was stupid enough to be painting without opening a window.
6833 2018-06-25 10:19:13 Seems like the oil lobby knows no shame

6837 2018-06-25 10:18:54 4yrs ago we voted to take back control of our fishing, oil, energy, transport, finance, welfare, and everything else. You and your unionist buddies opposed it, lied to voters and scared the bejesus out o pensioners. Do you realise how contradictory your position is?
6838 2018-06-25 10:18:36 That there is still fracking or any oil exploration done anywhere is a big and scary horror in itself.
6839 2018-06-25 10:18:35 According to @BrookingsInst, Nigeria, the 5th oil producing country in the world has overtaken India as the country with the largest number of extreme poor, whereas in 2014, Nigeria was ranked 3rd fastest growing economy in the world....
6840 2018-06-25 10:18:15 Looking forward to working on a new storytelling piece about how important it is to keep drains and pipes clear, thinking of a creative way of telling people not to pour cooking oil and food down their sink
6841 2018-06-25 10:17:47 No. Stalingrad was named that because it was the most important Volga river oil transport city from Baku to industrial sector. Stalin was not even Russian. Everybody laughed at his Georgian accent when he came on the radio.

6873 2018-06-25 10:09:23 Perhaps the switch from paper is a result of the drive to expand markets for petro byproducts. "Naptha is the creme de la creme of a barrel of oil which cannot be refined into gasoline or motor oil ... sort of a by product of the refining process." (Brentwood Plastics).

6891 2018-06-25 10:05:58 That's just the beginning. Those huge tailing ponds/lakes will take decades, if not centuries, to clean up. Who's going to pay for that? The foreign oil corporations will be long gone and they'll go bankrupt to avoid the clean up clauses in their contracts.

6894 2018-06-25 10:05:02 Oil is not the problem. Sugar (in all its forms) is. Sugar is poison for the body, so using less oil while frying your potato chips doesn’t make any difference. You’re much better off eating deep fried cheese.

Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May

We know that when there is a price increase on oil, vegetables fruits and other related products has price increase too.
6967 2018-06-25 09:48:11 You are so naive.

Because Iraq looks SO much better after US invasion. Or Afghanistan. Or Libya. US cares only for own economic interests. War & destabilization of regions boost US economy revolving around oil & arms saleseven if Iraq dances to US tunes, Iraqis wont be safe.

GOOD OR BAD?

Here are the keys:

They are NOT HEALTHY IF:

They were extracted or pressed or
in some way separated from their
original source.

WHAT?

Yes, extracted oil is toxic
to the liver, paralyzing it.

But, in the whole raw source 
they are healthy.

7182 2018-06-25 09:00:24 Doesn't help. Oil is a world commodity. If the OPEC raises the price,  the US producers will do the same to extra provit. If US won't buy it, some other country will ...

7227 2018-06-25 08:51:19 "ever" that word is elusive and it's what snake oil salesmen use ( read : Oz's and their msm) Sachin isn't the best "ever" and he himself will agree to this. Things change, tactics changes, "GOAT" is a stupid term, but hey it's simpletons all around, can't argue with them.
7228 2018-06-25 08:51:19 He’s got his shirt on so can’t be Kennedy. No baby oil in sight. !
7229 2018-06-25 08:51:04 Looks delicious. I love sliced fennel with lemon, olive oil and a little sea salt (just enough fennel to cover a frying pan), cover with boiled water, cook until water has almost gone. Add lots of parmesan, then grill to brown the top. It's lovely with a glass of Pinot Grigio.

7231 2018-06-25 08:50:39 It's mustard oil 
7232 2018-06-25 08:50:09 Very cool recipe. Do you try Olive oil in your recipes?
7233 2018-06-25 08:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
7234 2018-06-25 08:49:57 That would effect oil prices silly

7237 2018-06-25 08:49:12 I totally agree, as can be seen in the ashes of the promises of Better Together in 2014, Better Together 2 claims need robust denial. There were too many lies last time on HMRC/Oil/Ship building jobs, Vow and EU as examples for that to happen again.

7239 2018-06-25 08:48:59 Surprising question - who bears the cost of all government schemes? The answer is obvious so doesn’t need repeating. Also, this is a social welfare scheme where the costs are likely to be around 40k CR annually. Not a massive amount. I am sure oil surpluses will pay for it.

7247 2018-06-25 08:46:07 Anything from neutrogena usually works. If you have dry skin use a scrub with a cleansing oil, cleansing oil first, and if you have oily skin use a gel cleanser, or foam cleanser. Just make sure to always moisturize the skin after cleansing

7249 2018-06-25 08:45:39 The public transport in every other western country I've ever been is far better than ours, where the oil + auto lobby have opposed good PT.

7274 2018-06-25 08:39:04 The reason for high inflation we're
1,. Cost of 1971 war.  It was unavailable
2. First oil crisis, OPEC slashed production & increased prices. 
3. It was brought year with farm output short of demand. 

In no way I support it however even devil must get it's due.

7288 2018-06-25 08:34:21 It’s easy to do in a country with trillions in the vault from selling oil for a century. Ever wondered why Sweden has many world leading companies (with a low corp tax rate btw) exporting and driving national wealth why Norway has virtually nothing?

7295 2018-06-25 08:33:30 I find the remainers pathological refusal to accept the result of the vote - and their snake oil salesman excuses for their behaviour in not doing so - mind-boggling.

7449 2018-06-25 07:58:28 True as this may be,the cartels could regroup and import millions of liters in palm oil,tonnes of cassava and whatever it is that will be in high demand just like they did with maize then sugar.These are heartless crooks not any better than drug barons.

7492 2018-06-25 07:48:40 Personally, I would say that the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes ought to be legalised now. It does apparently assist sufferers of MS and severe epilepsy, and I feel it is cruel to deny treatment that helps them. Canada is right, police time spent better elsewhere.

7532 2018-06-25 07:40:16 Not palm oil. It's hugely destructive to the environment. It's not the production of one thing over another it's most lack of incentive, know how and exorbitant costs leveraged by govt/cartels

7602 2018-06-25 07:25:37 Oil is for spiritual warfare (whatever that means); his bodyguards are to protect him from the competition.
7603 2018-06-25 07:25:22 The most common cause is lack of/low transmission oil. Check your oil. If it looks good and isnt low, then move on to the simpler components. Probably your temp sensor. Either the sensor is bad, or a bad/loose connector/plug.

7644 2018-06-25 07:18:03 No, that is not right and it is not reasonable . That is oil in fire, it does not help the cause. It sickens moderate people and excites the rest. Listen how cleverly Trumps cites such stuff during his speeches.  Search for better options.

Anyway, Libya was not bombed for oil, so your argument falls there.

7760 2018-06-25 06:59:36 @GGJuliePayette @JustinTrudeau please get rid of the section 604 in NAFTA. Why should we be bound to send oil to them? How about water and hydro?  Curtail that or perhaps slap tariffs on those. Trump’s crazier by the minute We can’t bow down to him. You know “give him an inch...”

7790 2018-06-25 06:52:31 It's just linked, because when you privatise the rail service, it gives the company the choice: Renewable energy or fossil fuels. They will always choose the latter so global terrorism will never end, since there will always be a big demand for oil and other energy sources.

8018 2018-06-25 06:05:33 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.
8019 2018-06-25 06:05:25 Same.. coconut oil!!!!! You only need so little and it has sooo many other benefits
8020 2018-06-25 06:05:21 castor oil makin my eyebrows go from nonexistent to extistent ... bless up 
8021 2018-06-25 06:05:17 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
8022 2018-06-25 06:05:13 Itu mineral oil yang hampir (atau mungkin sama sekali) ga ada natural2nya, hanya bikin lembab dan di aku malah bikin clogged pore :”
8023 2018-06-25 06:04:29 These super hero things aren’t nerdy, they’re utterly tedious. Why not pitch colours against each other or types of engine oil?
8024 2018-06-25 06:04:18 "Now we add a tablespoon of olive oil" *glugs half the bottle into a bowl*
8025 2018-06-25 06:04:09 Not true. But I have read his book. And I trust health Canada over your snake oil.
8026 2018-06-25 06:03:54 Why are consumers paying $3 billion a year for fake pipelines taxes?  FERC allows oil pipelines to charge 54% more than net profits to cover a corporate income tax that was exempted in 1986. Refund our money!!
8027 2018-06-25 06:03:54 The oil maybe (?

8032 2018-06-25 06:03:10 Luis, I never disagree with anything you say (I am an agreeable person ), but as someone who is deeply involved in the oil and gas industry, how do we navigate to the 22nd Century?

Disclaimer: worms will be crawling out my eye-sockets by that time.
8033 2018-06-25 06:03:03 Guys, I know that the main #AlisonEttel story is that she endangered the life of a POC child for selling water bottles, but can we also not gloss over how insanely irresponsible and dangerous it is that she tried to sell unregulated, unresearched cannabis oil for dogs?
8034 2018-06-25 06:02:41 Those “greedy oil executives” would love to ship oil through safer #pipelines. But the protestors and enabling governments have slowed that for now. So yeah, it can and should be on the backs of the anti-pipeline crowd.
8035 2018-06-25 06:02:40 Put your salt water solution in a spray bottle with like 5 drops of tea tree oil, put the lid on, swirl it and then spray it on the piercing 3 times a day, it’s great for when you’re on the go and just in general, plus the tea tree stops infections and fluid bumps!
8036 2018-06-25 06:02:24 Who the hell uses Oil?
8037 2018-06-25 06:02:17 Not really made of real oil.
8038 2018-06-25 06:02:00 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.

8044 2018-06-25 06:00:30 I have tea tree oil and they say it dries out your skin I applied it on my entire face and woke up with it so oily like it’s weird bc everyone else claims it dries out their face
8045 2018-06-25 06:00:02 Nuts Birthday to Supreme Snot Oil Of Man Clarence Thomas, a foe and prick titties!
8046 2018-06-25 05:59:37 Considering the risk, long-term relationship and the Iranian sanctions that are in plain sight, China would not turn to Iran as a oil supplier. I agree with Jerry Bailey that China is unlikely to risk further damaging its relationship with the U.S. by violating U.S. sanctions.
8047 2018-06-25 05:59:36 If you value having a livable planet you would naturally be against Canadian oil and gas extraction (along with everywhere else.) #KeepItInTheGround
8048 2018-06-25 05:59:26 So how is the oil s level after 5k?
8049 2018-06-25 05:59:24 the clinique dramatically different gel is really nice! It provides just enough moisture for the whole day without being too heavy or promoting oil in the t-zone area
8050 2018-06-25 05:59:07 It will be built regardless..and the traffic will increase again..and the air pollution etc etc. More roads built..more traffic and another Heathrow expansion...and so on and so on...till the oil runs out?
8051 2018-06-25 05:58:46 So you don’t see any issue with bulk carriers then, they don’t sound the same as tankers?

Increase in tanker traffic is a fraction of the overall shipping increase we’ll see in the decades to come. 

So why don’t you just admit you’re simply against oil.
8052 2018-06-25 05:57:47 But is it white truffle oil?
8053 2018-06-25 05:57:36 Do you know how much coconut oil costs compared to water and body wash? Kmt! Mek di oil soak in and don’t waste a drop.
8054 2018-06-25 05:57:36 Yes, that's right. He was responsible for it all with his over-regulation, the war on coal, steel & oil, high taxes, and American companies flowing across the globe like water. He cost many people their jobs, businesses & homes. Thank God he's history. And thank God for Trump!
8055 2018-06-25 05:57:34 taking oil out of the ground now is stealing from our future generations, pipelines are like high speed getaway vehicles.

8059 2018-06-25 05:56:14 With truffle oil, no less!
8060 2018-06-25 05:55:36 Are you aware how cetaceans hunt? This increase in tanker traffic will have a DIRECT impact on their ability to hunt and communicate. The science is qrystal clear. Prey availability is not the only issue. Stop writing off facts because it doesn't fit your "paid by oil" narrative

8073 2018-06-25 05:51:14 somebody make sure I get an oil change tomorrow. 
8074 2018-06-25 05:51:08 Get yourself a bottle of Avon skin so soft dry oil spray - original if you are prone to being bitten. Contains citronella so keeps the wee blighters away. Tea tree might help you now though
8075 2018-06-25 05:50:58 The great thing about oil painting is that it is so forgiving. Make a mistake? Just push the paint around a little, try something else. You have time to figure it out. The bad thing about oil painting? It takes all the time in the world to dry.
8076 2018-06-25 05:50:44 Hot oil on a hot stove can cause fire big time.

8084 2018-06-25 05:48:54 focus on cleansing first. know your cleanser and toner. acne prone could be tricky, some moisturiser got thick oil in it so it might clog pores. toner routine will make a huge change, really.
8085 2018-06-25 05:48:52 if you put olive oil in your ear, And pad it with cotton wool it can kinda help to sort it out

8100 2018-06-25 05:46:09 I almost just did a really dumb thing. Was gonna take the hair off my legs and looked up sugar scrub recipes. They all called for oil instead of water, so I mixed some up but realized that rinsing it down the drain might be bad. A few quick searches confirmed it. Crisis averted.

8155 2018-06-25 05:32:56 It is not a secret. But no one talks about it. The US is dependent on energy. They cannot afford anyone to control gas/oil sources, routes, or markets. US foreign policy ALL flows from this. People talking about other things are just helping to cover up the truth.
8156 2018-06-25 05:32:50 Oh, I read this.  The answer is: a gallon of oil.
8157 2018-06-25 05:32:50 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest. The portion of central share of excise taxes- the major chunk goes to the states - is being spent on social sector and rural infrastructure like never before.
8158 2018-06-25 05:32:40 This man @realDonaldTrump is a disgusting, despicable human. If you believe in what he is saying. I am sorry but your being sold snake oil. #Lyingtrump #snake #TrumpRussia #NeedtoImpeach #useless #Traders #disgusting #basketofdeplorable
8159 2018-06-25 05:32:29 Definitely you may get a peak of oil depending how oily you are but just set well I feel like you should be good
8160 2018-06-25 05:32:23 Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me. 
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me, all the days of my life,
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

8305 2018-06-25 05:02:29 Release sanctions on Russia so they can start drilling in the arctic and also raise oil prices as much as possible - wage war in Iran - so DT can profit off his Rosneft 19% stake and make billions. Also; allow him to sell off American assets for personal profit. That’s the “job”

8308 2018-06-25 05:01:38 The people of America must wake up and understand that their freedom belongs on their soil. Those soldiers are blindly fighting not for your freedom, but for the benefit of rich. The oil and arms industry’s who are gaining profit from their death. Open your eyes.

8321 2018-06-25 04:58:42 Bahahaha you wish buddy... I still get calls to work out there... I wanted to farm my family farm, and needed money to do so, so you can Fuck off with that comment.   Oil could be $1.50 and I could still find work for 200 hours a month.   Last oil crash of 09’ I worked steady.

Others, especially digital ones, aren't scarce at all, and in due course many physical ones will cease to be.

8351 2018-06-25 04:53:23 Well. All those many dollars we paid in the past 70 years to foster the oil industry created how much loyalty from it today? And solar's subsidies will be gone real soon. And you'll surely be dead before the future so who cares about your opinion?
8352 2018-06-25 04:53:13 The only way they get the tax breaks is buy hiring. Oil/pipeline companies pay into the orphan fund for site clean up if a company shuts down. "Green companies are exempt from paying into it. Farmers could be on the hook to remove if on their property.

8446 2018-06-25 04:36:20 Not sure how Trump keeps selling the story that everyone is lying about him and only he is an honest and forthright individual. He must be the reincarnation of a snake oil salesman.

8456 2018-06-25 04:34:49 But not the oil for meds
8457 2018-06-25 04:34:48 Ohhhh haah arwah atok thyroid kan. Betul jugak. Sebab oil ni pun laki boleh pakai.
8458 2018-06-25 04:34:23 How does ordering the product work? Shampoo Conditioner Hair Mask & Hair Oil. Everything bundle is $35, each item is $10. Delivery $5, shipping is $7 & pick up is free. Cashapp:$cutelikechelly. Products will be sent out on July 10th. I’ll send a sc once payment is delievered
8459 2018-06-25 04:34:03 Oily skin? It's still OK to use cream foundation. Apply it with a damp makeup sponge, which picks up the pigment but not the product's oil.
8460 2018-06-25 04:34:00 “Canola” is short for “Canadian oil.” = mind blown
8461 2018-06-25 04:33:37 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
8462 2018-06-25 04:33:35  Seriously, it's supposed to be good for anxiety but it's really expensive.  One of our rescued dogs was abused before we got him and he has problems.  Doggie prozac: $15 a month vs. CBD oil: $160 a month. Both work. Guess which one he's getting. 
8463 2018-06-25 04:33:19 Crap, I've waded that turd stream all season.
8464 2018-06-25 04:33:16 Thank you very much Eithne for the quick response, i am a Forex trader i lost on Friday when i took a short position for WTI. i have lost so much on Forex but i still feel i will recover some over time. In my own view i think Oil price will continue to fall.
8465 2018-06-25 04:33:04 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
8466 2018-06-25 04:32:59 給与明細、税金で萎えるので開いていない
8467 2018-06-25 04:32:35 that comparison is a vicious insult to snake oil salesmen.

8475 2018-06-25 04:31:08 Funny thing is the resource money Quebec gets from hydro is not included in the equalization formula yet ABs and Sask oil revenue is. Imagine that. What a joke.

8478 2018-06-25 04:30:51 Gil go with your BS somewhere else! The whole equalization scheme is flawed! If it was that all provinces will get something in return then it would be fine but QC only takes, doesn’t bring anything to the table and on top of that blocks AB oil & gas industry! Is a total ripoff!!

8483 2018-06-25 04:29:48 2 tbsp coconut oil will heal the cracking feet. @darwinspet or other high quality raw dog food will make Ava even happier.
8484 2018-06-25 04:29:44 The big dark money behind Trump has oil holdings. Is it a coincidence the price of gas (despite dropped regs & record production) has gone up sharply since Trump elected?

Dark $ doesn't allow coincidences, they create them...
8485 2018-06-25 04:29:36 I burned the shit out of my hand w hot oil today at work 
8486 2018-06-25 04:29:27 The fact that we have to pay almost $5 for a gallon of gasoline in Canada while it's about half of that in the US while the US gets a lot of oil from Canada is absolutely ridiculous and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Our gas prices in Canada are ridiculously high.
8487 2018-06-25 04:29:17 Is?.... pan?.. spatula? Olive oil? Hmmmmmmm grille?
8488 2018-06-25 04:29:14 You can’t expect a plant to grow if your pouring oil into it

8490 2018-06-25 04:28:29 Snake oil salesmen are more convincing.
8491 2018-06-25 04:28:17 Really. Quebec imports oil from human rights abusers.

8493 2018-06-25 04:27:46 Alternatives to Coconut Oil include Sweet Almond Oil, Olive Oil, Hemp Seed Oil and Avocado Oil for their moisturising properties. Pure Shea Butter, though more expensive, provides similar benefits to Coconut Oil but is completely non-comedogenic and won't cause acne or blackheads
8494 2018-06-25 04:27:30 Well hoping it's true Peppermint essential oil helps one to sleep cuz I just spilled a bunch all over my hand and washing it off didn't actually wash it all off LOL
8495 2018-06-25 04:27:16 Opposition leader Raila Odinga has asked Turkana residents to demand development projects instead of direct cash transfer of oil resources.
8496 2018-06-25 04:27:09 Selain cleansing oil, sunscreen pun kena beli as soon as possibleeee. OMOOOOOO
8497 2018-06-25 04:27:02 Oil will soon dry out. Tech will only keep advancing in the years to come. What plans does a place like Nigeria have once the oil has dried up?
8498 2018-06-25 04:26:26 Absolutely, way too generic & stalkerish of an account. Not to mention the horrible Oil takes. The ladies of the Oilers Twitterverse are much more intelligent than this.
8499 2018-06-25 04:25:52 I don’t know if it’s broken but if a man can’t change the oil in my car, my pussy will not get wet. 
8500 2018-06-25 04:25:48 Don’t forget the guns he illegally sent to Mexico to get Americans shot & push his gun control agenda. The murder of Brian Terry didn’t quite turn out the way he planned, but you can get away w/ all kinds of heinous criminality if a complicit media covers it up. Right @NYMag ?
8501 2018-06-25 04:25:28 Used to do this with a toothbrush and gasoline. Then sewing machine oil after it dried.

8509 2018-06-25 04:24:10 Rewatched Wind River tonight. The oil rig scene is still among the most tense, violent, surprising and heartbreaking scenes in a recent movie. Even knowing it was coming was still brutal.
8510 2018-06-25 04:23:49 PS I have super primrose softgels you can have if you want them! There’s like 100 left! Supposedly helps uterus soften/efface/prep for labor.

8516 2018-06-25 04:23:24 SK oil reserves didn’t start to be rapidly developed until new technology came around to access it. But as I said before, the SK boom started while the NDP was still in power. Bidding wars on houses, influx of people from AB & all that. Happened with NDP SK & PC AB. #skpoli
8517 2018-06-25 04:23:17 I started adding bond funds as well, but I generally love boring stuff like VTI, VEU, and VWO.

I think my out-performance is due to a large Twitter holding at around $16 a share.  Also oil has recovered nicely, which is another large holding (which I am reducing).

8532 2018-06-25 04:21:07 However this oil is highly comedogenic, meaning it clogs pores and produces blackheads and acne especially for people with oil skin. Its heavy nature means that this oil is often not absorbed into the skin properly and your skin therefore may not benefit from its listed assets
8533 2018-06-25 04:20:32 actually, many are asking us crackers to apologize for our ancestors.
8534 2018-06-25 04:20:28 The dove dry oil soap smells so bomb and it leaves your skin extra soft and moist

8560 2018-06-25 04:16:28 Cause SK didn’t have the same oil reserves as AB and the old PC govt that the @Sask_NDP took the reigns from had nearly pushed the province into defaulting on its debt. You continually show that you never bothered to read the article I posted to you.
8561 2018-06-25 04:16:05 Walking around Childress TX every business has help wanted signs. Hotels, restaurants, oil services, everybody. 10-15 dollars an hour. Who wants to live out here doing the jobs nobody else wants? Who could we find to fill these jobs? Mmmmmmm.

8566 2018-06-25 04:14:57 Throughout the natural beauty community, there is high praise for Coconut Oil in all aspects of health. It contains Vitamin E, amino acids and maintains the skin's natural flora. It is commonly used as a moisturiser and makeup remover to repair skin and keep it glowing.
8567 2018-06-25 04:14:41 It would be awesome to see Ted Cruz selling his snake oil on Fox.
8568 2018-06-25 04:14:37 Our defence minister is an unashamed bully. Our police chief is chasing vendettas while his gang of bandits rob citizens daily. Our army chief is a skin oil merchant. Our minister of interior has completely lost his head. Yet we wonder the reason for the festivals of blood.

8581 2018-06-25 04:12:01 They are hemorrhaging money though. Can’t pay teachers a living wage or keep state parks up and running, but they sure can cut taxes for the oil industry. It makes me sad. There are a lot of hidden gems in Oklahoma.

8585 2018-06-25 04:11:44 It’s also funny how they harp on and on about big oil and big coal and how I’m a “tool” of “those in power” yet they don’t realize they are just campaigning for future “big green.” Then the “humanity is a cancer” is extremely off putting. Like if we’re so bad, go kill yourself?

8592 2018-06-25 04:10:04 for visual aesthetic use oil instead of butter, you can cook at a higher temp to help the food not stick + oil can reach higher temps without browning as much as butter. the milk fat/solids start to burn earlier than oil.
8593 2018-06-25 04:09:51 as someone who gets frequent ocular migranes/cluster headaches, i've found that about 600mg of ibruprofen, 1,000 mg of acetominophen, and peppermint oil on the origin point (mine is usually my left eye) help a lot!!!
8594 2018-06-25 04:09:37 Funny hearing a POS snake oil salesman talk poorly of a straight arrow decorated former Marine.
8595 2018-06-25 04:09:32 Oil prices fall on expected output rise in wake of OPEC deal: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices fell over 1.5 percent on Monday as traders factored in an expected output increase that was agreed at the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting…

8604 2018-06-25 04:08:19 Bit like tar sands in Canada - using 10 barrels of oil energy equivalent to extract 1 barrel of oil. A five year old could work out that is on a Bridge to nowhere...
8605 2018-06-25 04:07:46 Your tariffs will hurt everybody but.. China won’t buy $1 B/mth of oil which they can buy from Canada. You won’t be able to produce enough steel for US needs. We will stop buying products from US. Tariffed countries can trade more with each other and the world. US with Russia
8606 2018-06-25 04:07:17 He is most likely correct,. Big oil should focus on manufacturing sector, and alt fuels for general public,. Or down the road oil will run out.
8607 2018-06-25 04:07:08 Oil prices will fall but the prices of consumer goods that were forced higher will remain high. It's almost as if the cost of oil is manipulated by manufacturers to force a higher price for consumer goods.
8608 2018-06-25 04:07:08 We’ve been here before with these down weeks... $CL_F oil is the play long... $ES_F 2720s before a move back up.. $SPX $SPY $COP

8612 2018-06-25 04:06:33 Only spicy dressing is good, and there are 1500 bottles at the grocery store but spicy dressing can only be had at chop't. Just a little olive oil is fine.

8618 2018-06-25 04:05:14 Coconut Oil's antibacterial properties also make it a good choice for Oil Pulling if you prefer a natural alternative to traditional mouthwash. When used daily for 15-20min prior to brushing and flossing, it can whiten teeth, reduce bad breath and prevent cavities and gingivitis

8626 2018-06-25 04:03:40 Not only type 2 diabetics but also type 1 and type 3 (? wonder what) can be cured by virgin/organic coconut oil. Period.

But where do we get organic coconut oil?
branded oils are refined oils removed of all nutrients so it is a waste. You rarely get virgin/organic coconut oil.

8657 2018-06-25 03:59:07 Sorry, I can't seen to find it. It was a reply @GlobalProTrader and yuan reserve adjustment as funding (liquidity) mechanism of Yaun denominated oil contracts. In short, the Yaun is not liquid enough to fund replacement of 10% of USD denominate oil contracts let alone 100%.

8665 2018-06-25 03:57:04 I think a standalone PE can misguide, for ex. without sensex level gross margin oil contribution, PAT %, supply side data etc. A hope crash of 20% was always on cards but not bubble overall. Selective pocket bubbles IMO - SME etc. we r yet to see years of economic performance
8666 2018-06-25 03:57:01 yeah I have to use butter and peanut oil or it smokes too much and the smoke detector has a fit. But they fry up really crispy and nice overall, I was very surprised that they kept their shape without cracks or breaking apart.

8673 2018-06-25 03:55:23 So they both made their money from oil just like numerous other men, what is your point?
8674 2018-06-25 03:55:09 You could try CBD Oil. I've used it before and it helps with anxiety and helps me relax. I'm sure a drop or two before a match would help!

8688 2018-06-25 03:52:05 If you don't like systems that white man built, move to a country where Non whites are in charge. Africa or Mexico, you don't have to stay in this oppressive regime.

8692 2018-06-25 03:51:39 I don't mean to be a jerk. #PermitPatty is vile. But pot and crack cocaine have nothing in common. And most agree pot should be legalized, or at least no longer Sch 1 narcotic.

She sells treats with CBD oil, which is the "medical" part of the plant which doesn't get you high.

8704 2018-06-25 03:49:47 Coconut Oil is deeply conditioning and antibacterial, making it perfect for application as a conditioning and anti-dandruff hair treatment. Used overnight or 15 minutes before showering, this oil will tame frizzy strands and add shine to your locks. Make sure to wash throughly.
8705 2018-06-25 03:49:39 You have done a fabulous job and really burnt the midnight oil in your role. Well done.

8855 2018-06-25 03:24:07 Dogs can take CBD which is legal in all 50 states. THC is not okay. It will make them sick or worse. I live in Washington state and a local pet store sells CBD oil for pain and anxiety in dogs.
8856 2018-06-25 03:23:49 So what it was due to oil. Oil is a resource. Even after decades of war inflicted on them by USA on shoddy grounds, the countries now mired in sectarianism and terrorism, their human development indexes are still better than India.

8860 2018-06-25 03:22:29 no, I see nothing. when Hillbots use the term "left", they have to, lest they admit they're not an opposition party. DNC is still fucking around w/votes, hiring big oil, pharma lobbyists. the party is corrupt af.
they're mainstream hawkish Republicans, certainly not the LEFT.

8868 2018-06-25 03:21:05 I don't see that happening. The US will continue buying deeply discounted CDN oil because that's just good business.

8875 2018-06-25 03:20:08 RAILWAYS SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON MORE  RAIL TRACKS AND MORE FREQUENT TRAINS TO REDUCE IMPORTED OIL FOR MASS TRANSPORT.
8876 2018-06-25 03:20:04 I disagree, their policies r evil. The only power we have is the power of protest. They r imprisoning people, taking their children, trying 2 get rid of due process,cutting Medicaid & Medicare,cutting women’s healthcare,allowing water 2 b contaminated by oil. No justice no peace.

8890 2018-06-25 03:17:37 a vinaigrette is definitely preferable to a creamy dressing. but i don’t think they’re even needed. sometimes if it’s a spinach salad or kale i might do a little oil/vinegar or salsa but that’s pretty much it.

He starts pulling up porn and spankin it. He wanted me to leave and close the door.   !
8899 2018-06-25 03:16:25 You get another high from using up a whole bottle of olive oil

8902 2018-06-25 03:15:28 If you’re looking for a birth control to help with acne I’d highly highly recommend talking to your doctor about Nikki. It contains spironolactone which is a medication dermatologists prescribe by itself for hormonal acne. It has helped me a million fold. It helps dry up oil too!

8907 2018-06-25 03:15:02 Almond oil is a blessing.
8908 2018-06-25 03:14:41 This is the outcome of your policies. You only care about Big Oil. You're a dinosaur and you're going to be voted out. This country needs forward-thinking leaders who will invest in renewable energy. Vote for @Scholten4Iowa
8909 2018-06-25 03:14:31 Toast kiwi fruit and aubergine in vadouvan for just a moment. Serve with a bit of chili oil.
8910 2018-06-25 03:14:30 You need to check the  anti-freeze and the oil. Sounds like the oil is low. And that can damage or destroy you engine.
8911 2018-06-25 03:14:18 Other girls taking a bath: cool bath bomb, wine, very relaxed.

8913 2018-06-25 03:14:10 My dad was on Oil Tankers in the South Pacific, night watch looking for submarine conning towers coming up to take aim at them.

8915 2018-06-25 03:13:50 Crude Oil ($CL_F) portfolio is based on 11 systems …consisting of trend, momentum & pattern based systems spread across multiple intra-day and daily time frames.  It does well ... just not in June.  The over all portfolio is still doing nicely.
8916 2018-06-25 03:13:47 I use coconut oil about once a week and have a straightener with silicone strips that smooth it like no other.
8917 2018-06-25 03:13:44 Yea..that's why your cult goes to the deserts and other Islamic countries and sell themselves for oil and money!

8919 2018-06-25 03:12:59 Nothing Obama’s did - not one policy - not one law signed led to the lessening of dependence on foreign oil. In fact he tried to tighten control by restricting offshore drilling and closing the Arctic Refuge
8920 2018-06-25 03:12:43 only i would cut my finger on a bottle of olive oil.
8921 2018-06-25 03:12:38 Oil changes are important.
Some foods call for canola.
Other foods call for peanut!
8922 2018-06-25 03:12:29 shout out to all the oil slowly heading towards our water supply here - I love the consistency we're seeing with every single method of oil transportation failing and poisoning everything
8923 2018-06-25 03:12:20 You need to have your eyes examined and hearing checked, because you're under the control of your orange overlord to the point of buying anything he says. He's a snake oil salesman. Beware.

8929 2018-06-25 03:11:34 Just shows how little you know.  Cannabis hemp is more than a drug. Hemp is the silent casualty in the war on cannabis. Their war was based on bullsh*t because they couldn't declare war on a renewable resource that could compete with oil, wood, and cotton.  They knew!

8934 2018-06-25 03:11:19 I mean it's a carb in oil...so I can see the logic...but...seriously...EVERYTHING IN MODERATION. I could eat nothing but "alligator pears" for the next two years and it would probably lead to the same result.
8935 2018-06-25 03:11:19 We still only produce 40% of the oil we consume. That means tapping into the oil in the Arctic Refuge responsibly will help reduce it even more. The only reason foreign dependence went down at all was due to GW Bush opening up drilling rights and with the fracking technology...
8936 2018-06-25 03:11:17 Finally have a day off tomorrow and by “day off” I mean, I don’t have to go to work but still have to get up early, get the oil in my car changed, get my nails filled, grocery shop, clean the house, and do at least 3 loads of laundry :,)
8937 2018-06-25 03:10:59 Don't forget to add mineral oil slicks.
8938 2018-06-25 03:10:58 If I see corn or canola oil in another barn.... 
8939 2018-06-25 03:10:54 That's the problem with methane *flaring* at oil & gas extraction installations. All the more reason to harvest it and use it to generate good energy where its needed

8969 2018-06-25 03:07:17 I don't seem to be able to make quesadillas properly, but the result is okay if greasy. Used Aldi GF wraps for it. Would probably try again without oil next time.
8970 2018-06-25 03:07:17 As recently as 2008 she threatened to socialize American oil companies. 

She didn't like the "supply and demand" explanation from an oil exec in response to her badgering about high gas prices.

8991 2018-06-25 03:04:00 This reminds me of where I live in West Texas.  Constant high winds and land so flat you can watch your dog run away for two weeks.  Zero doubt many of the oil field workers here have experienced this same issue.
8992 2018-06-25 03:04:00 Think of the beauty of Niagara Falls with a gorgeous oil slick.  Oh the beauty and awe.  Sarcasm in case you don't know.
8993 2018-06-25 03:03:51 everyone asks me how i got my hair so “long” (it’s not long to me but thank you for the compliments) and the secret is : argon oil everyday
8994 2018-06-25 03:03:50 Agree 100% I think the same will be true for Tavares if that Islanders deal or similar gets done
8995 2018-06-25 03:03:41 บางเรื่องไม่ต้องแสดงความคิดเห็นก็ได้แค่เอาใจช่วยเงียบๆ
8996 2018-06-25 03:02:58 I just spilled coconut oil on my comforter smh I could cry
8997 2018-06-25 03:02:55 i’ve been using fresh aloe on my face recently along w my usual cleanser and jojoba oil and my skin feels so good !!!!!!!

8999 2018-06-25 03:02:47 TOUCHING YOUR ACNE CAN CAUSE MORE OIL AND BACTERIA IN IT AND CAN GROW BIGGER BUT FUQ HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT TOUCH IT WHEN IT’S ITCHY AND IT’S PRETTY BIG
9000 2018-06-25 03:02:33 “what do they call oil?’
“OUL”
THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL FOIL?”
“FOUL?”
9001 2018-06-25 03:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
9002 2018-06-25 03:02:32 Enough buzz words to make a beehive jealous. Get over yourselves. Your software is a glorified Excel sheet at best. I wish companies would stop buying into this “onboarding” snake oil. It’s an absolute nightmare for applicants!

9004 2018-06-25 03:01:33 I totally agree with Nikki in regards to therapy being an oil change for the soul. It's been SUCH a big help for me. #TotalBellas

9006 2018-06-25 03:01:30 I need some oil sheen 
9007 2018-06-25 03:01:26 @AgendaFreeTV The oil spill would be more controllable if it STAYS in the water. They will have to remove soil if it goes on land

9009 2018-06-25 03:01:07 Those had full European support, and took place in an oil glut.
These secondary sanctions are being vigorously opposed, and there'sa coming bull market.
9010 2018-06-25 03:01:01 Canadian oil shipped to the usa should be increased in price by 500 per cent. Canadian Gold Silver and Platinum grades. And american fuel should be price degraded according to world oil prices also increase our royal lumber because theirs is also subsidized. Lets make it FAIR EH!

You couldn't carry Bush's trash out. 
You should not even utter @BarackObama's name, except in a long and sincere apology for all your hateful bullshit these past ten years.
And? 
Fuck you, Asshole.

9021 2018-06-25 03:00:03 It’s fuck glad that Nancy Pelosi and her number three, Cryin’ Gut Scraper Schumer, man oil to protect rubber immigrants chism less than the citizens of our nuts. The Divided States cannot shit for this. We wants blow and insecurity at our borders!
9022 2018-06-25 03:00:00 Is this oil? Acrylic with medium mix?? I love the texture
9023 2018-06-25 02:59:25 They ask what I'm making for dinner.

Match-stick cut potatoes fried in oil with a side of a tomato-vinegar sauce.

They voted for him, now they see #Oil trumps crawfish and the #environment. If @RepClayHiggins is pro Trump then he is pro oil and not pro crawfishermen...
9025 2018-06-25 02:58:55 Lemme touch it. I'll make you beard oil.
9026 2018-06-25 02:58:44 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
9027 2018-06-25 02:58:36 I’ve been in so much pain the past couple days, to the point of crying when I was trying to foam roll for some relief. CBD oil is the only thing that’s helped me. #CannabisIsMedicine 
9028 2018-06-25 02:58:30 It is the only democracy in the Middle East and the most modern country in the region. All that has been acomplished without oil and other natural resourses :-)
9029 2018-06-25 02:58:29 Gotta get a oil change tomorrow

9037 2018-06-25 02:56:36 Oil transport doesn’t displace anything, it forces investment in railroads to expand capacity.  Costs to transport goods by rail are the cheapest in the world and have been dropping for decades.
9038 2018-06-25 02:56:36 On top of that, collecting tiny buckets of agri waste across a wide region, transporting them to processing pits is diesel intensive. The land competes with food. Octane value of BF is nowhere near mineral oil. Bio-fuel is a completely bad idea on all parameters.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9040 2018-06-25 02:56:12 Omg this oil blend i made for my scalp has me on a fuckin cloud 
9041 2018-06-25 02:56:12 i always put too much oil on
9042 2018-06-25 02:56:03 As someone that comes from a major oil producing state (but Ohio was first), gas should really be @ 2.50/gal, but this isn't really a result of him, nor any other Prez. Why was gas $3.00/gal when a BBL was $130, and same at $70, you visit Std Oil in Clev, I'll visit Exxon in Hou!
9043 2018-06-25 02:55:41 It's interesting to me that on a ketogenic diet you're basically turning yourself into a car that runs off oil.
9044 2018-06-25 02:55:20 Watched deepwater horizon, it’s about the BP oil spill and WOW...it was such a good movie definitely recommend watching it especially if you know nothing about the oil spill like me, I googled the shit out of it lol

9049 2018-06-25 02:54:50 It's understandable that the Caps want to sign Carlson but at that number and term, they could be kicking themselves 3 or 4 yrs into the deal. Awfully big risk.
9050 2018-06-25 02:54:08 Cook with it. Put it in your shakes if you don’t like MCT oil.
9051 2018-06-25 02:53:35 Kalau kau ada kapal boleh beli fuel oil secara murah dari tengah laut. Either dari pirate vietnam or tongkang ikan. Dorang ni beli minyak dari nelayan yg dapat subsidi kerajaan ataupun dari kapal dagang yg jual minyak penggunaan mereka
9052 2018-06-25 02:53:23 Shower shoes, Clorox wipes, and and a power strip! Also I have a essential oil diffuser because you can’t have candles :)

9054 2018-06-25 02:52:29 Cuz said “don’t try to argue with me cuz your nigga tripping, I’m on this oil nigga gon pull up and give you the business” idk why but that shit sounded so smooooth 
9055 2018-06-25 02:52:19 Short answer:
Selling part of Canada requires going into EQ pot, because our soil is lost forever.
Exported oil is soil lost forever.
Hydro: not a drop of water gets exported.
AB exports Canadian soil.
QC exports energy.

Does that make sense in 280 char?
9056 2018-06-25 02:52:11 Spinach is loaded with vitamins A &amp; C, which help your body create sebum, the oil secreted by follicles to give your hair gloss &amp; shine.

9061 2018-06-25 02:51:16 My grandaunt rubbed this weed oil concoction on my mosquito bites  and the itching stopped almost instantaneously... I love marijuana.
9062 2018-06-25 02:51:14 Where in that statement did I say get rid of oil???
9063 2018-06-25 02:50:56 I still don't quite comprehend their buying what he was selling.  Descendant of the original snake oil salesman I think.
9064 2018-06-25 02:50:56 Bootty rub with oil involved 
9065 2018-06-25 02:50:52 My room smells like a witch doctor. Eucalyptus oil on the diffuser. A criminal amount of Vick’s.  And to top it off an essential oil roller ball all over my temples and sinus areas of the face. My eyes are burning by my nose says try harder.

9069 2018-06-25 02:50:31 She should, but I hope she doesn’t.
9070 2018-06-25 02:50:08 It's just organic virgin coconut oil, organic cinnamon extract and organic stevia. They make others and some savory ones. Hyvee sells it.
9071 2018-06-25 02:49:53 Wind, hydroelectric and solar. Yet our current administration is attached to 1st coal and then oil. Does that make sense when considering the economy and ecology?
9072 2018-06-25 02:49:47 Her comment is rather rich coming from someone who associates with Cecile Richards.
9073 2018-06-25 02:49:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
9074 2018-06-25 02:49:04 Scandal overload. Between Pruitt’s sweetheart deals with lobbyists, Zinke’s sale of our natural treasure to oil ang has  interests and Ross’s hinky finances, it’s easy to get lost in the criminal shitshow that is the @realDonaldTrump administration.
9075 2018-06-25 02:48:56 I will not be satisfied until 7-11 comes out with the oil drum gulp
9076 2018-06-25 02:48:55 Quebec favours imported oil and other products because the consider themselves a “nation” not a province of Canada and deal internationally to prove that point. They are treasonous sndcan never be trusted. Will always work to undermine Canada
9077 2018-06-25 02:48:51 Democracy and freedom have zero to do with Canadian oil and gas. You’re lying to people.
9078 2018-06-25 02:48:25 The Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) will sign MoU to invest in the proposed Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals (RRPCL) at Hotel Leela Palace in New Delhi.

9080 2018-06-25 02:48:08 Your "sense" needs calibrating. 
You are seeing things as you want them to be, not as they are. 
Important difference.
9081 2018-06-25 02:48:01 With the coconut oil, become familiar,how?
9082 2018-06-25 02:47:57 He is a bit of a lovable redneck. He makes his living on the oil fields and because Trump was considered to be pro-oil it was an understandable choice. I explained to him that Trump was an obvious fraud. he could only fall back on the negative things he had heard about Hillary

9090 2018-06-25 02:46:31 Selling oil and buying food is the name of Nick Land they should be forced out of the publicly defined circle of "good humans."
9091 2018-06-25 02:46:13 As much as I hate A-Rod as a player, he is a pretty darn good color analyst for ESPN. Now he is oil and water w Mendoza, but who cares, both give great insight into the game. #Nats #OnePursuit #Phillies #IBackTheNats
9092 2018-06-25 02:46:03 If you have pubic hair you should be putting essential oils on that shit after you shower. Rose water, Lemongrass oil & vitamin E/Glycerin.
9093 2018-06-25 02:45:39 Truth is the mess you guys are making with oil sands will have to be cleaned one day or another and it will cost a fortune. Who is going to pay? Just Albertans or all Canadians?
9094 2018-06-25 02:45:34 Stop! You're making us hungry! Luckily one of our deleagtes brought in a lemon, yoghurt and olive oil cake *drool*
9095 2018-06-25 02:45:25 Russia is almost all white people, and when you Republicans arrive, it will be even more white. They have lots of oil for you to dig out of the ground. They don’t allow a free press, so you can use State TV all you want with no dissent.

9110 2018-06-25 02:42:54 Crude Oil has been a hard market for our systems to trade as of late ... been getting chopped.
9111 2018-06-25 02:42:44 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

9115 2018-06-25 02:41:27 Thanking god for this great job opportunity he gave me. I always wanted to work in the oil fields and tomorrow I start, now gotta work my ass off and make them big boy bucks 
9116 2018-06-25 02:41:14 No carbs after 6PM or at least 5 hours before you go to sleep.

Become familiar with Coconut Oil, MCT Oil and a good quality Protein Powder Blend. 

Make shakes on the road. Use Metformin. Eat your carbs around your weight training.
9117 2018-06-25 02:40:59 Yep.  And almost always it was about oil.
9118 2018-06-25 02:40:58 Call me crazy but Russia and Saudi Arabia lifting oil production limits sounds like they're losing market share

9132 2018-06-25 02:38:42 You can do it in your dishwasher if you have one. You'll need one of those vacuum sealers. The tricky part will be baking the crust sans toppings. You might want to brush the top with olive oil to recreate the same texture or do a layer of sauce and then add a 2nd after baking.

9145 2018-06-25 02:36:31 Well black spots, help with my pores and I have oil build up on my noise area, forehead and under my eyes area
9146 2018-06-25 02:36:02 Mungkin harus dibarengin sama oil yang lain, sebenernya aku disaranin sama adminnya buat pake jojoba/sunflo juga selain ricebran, namun berhubung duit ini tidak memadai untuk membeli semua waktu itu jadinya beli ricebran doang deh 
9147 2018-06-25 02:35:43 I literally cannot swallow olives to save my life. I can't even do olive oil without garlic. Something about the savory and sweet with the earthy after taste. I just can't do it. I think it's because I ate a big muffuletta as a kid and got olive overload. Ever since then...nope!
9148 2018-06-25 02:35:38 So if I sell you a car paid in full, I can still come drive it years later? Of course I'll pay for my gas and be a good friend. Even changing the oil if it needs it while I'm using it and checking all the fluids, tire pressure, etc.
9149 2018-06-25 02:35:37 She is a snake oil salesmen
9150 2018-06-25 02:35:36 Hey @JaimeForUSRep @HerreraBeutler. Looks like your sea lion problem may be solved! With no protections against oil spills, sea lion populations will be at risk- especially the pups! Of course, oil spills don't discriminate, so spills will kill the salmon too.
9151 2018-06-25 02:35:11 I'm prepared to concede he is a talented snake oil salesman. Also a finely honed bully. At exhibiting gall, he's 'the greatest in history.'
9152 2018-06-25 02:34:51 this makes my head hurt
9153 2018-06-25 02:34:47 I'm out of midnight oil. Switching to the Aladdin lamp.
9154 2018-06-25 02:34:39 We do have borders. "Illegals" are only 10 million out 300 million. Less than 1%.

Most Hispanics were born here. They came with are annexation of large parts of Mexico. We captured Mexico City, but gave it back because we didn't want it. If we'd know about the value of oil ...
9155 2018-06-25 02:34:30 Looks like someone is primed for a snake oil purchase.

9180 2018-06-25 02:30:32 Long ass day. I had to change the oxygen sensor in my whip. Changed the spark plugs and wires and gave it an oil change while I was at it. No wonder mechanics be taxin.

9186 2018-06-25 02:29:40 I wonder how oils spills affect different areas in different ways. For example how do the consequences of this oil spill compare the spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010?
9187 2018-06-25 02:29:33 I’ve had my fair share of softball sunburns. I normally go with the APC and coconut oil after taking a cold shower. It seems to heal much faster.
9188 2018-06-25 02:29:18 I had this exact conversation in a bar the other night. He does not vote because “my people” wrote the rules. He wants to start over so “his people “ can write the rules.

9190 2018-06-25 02:28:58 I was only olive oil and salt until I got married.  But Jill is all about the heavy butter lol.  I don’t mind that so much it’s yummy.
9191 2018-06-25 02:28:48 #6 "fossil fuels"? Thought you'd know better than to use that cabal term that is purposely meant to convey scarcity.  It's a misnomer to call our Oil a "fossil fuel".  Conventional wisdom that oil comes from remains of animals and plants buried millions of years ago is a farce.
9192 2018-06-25 02:28:29 You and me both?
9193 2018-06-25 02:28:20 Simplifying: coal was the fuel of the 19th century, oil of the 20th century, natural gas of the 21st century and nuclear of the 22nd century.
9194 2018-06-25 02:28:12 Apply Apple cider vinegar to your skin. Dabbing with a washcloth drenched in it is the way I go. It helps with the sting and cools your skin. Don’t use aloe or any lotion with alcohol in it. Coconut oil works fairly well with the apple cider vinegar.
9195 2018-06-25 02:27:46 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

9209 2018-06-25 02:25:46 Anyway this is a super petty complaint but I'm just fed up that body lotion manufacturers seem to have decided that I *must* want petrolatum/mineral oil, shea butter or cocoa butter on my body.  

I want *none of these things*. Zero. No thank you and goodnight.
9210 2018-06-25 02:25:34 Both true. facts / data have been abt same for decades. U cannot find serious data show otherwise. No data says many Albertans & biz have NOT suffered from oil price decline. They have. av income remains higher despite that. What is ur solution? Gov support to ppl earning less?

9241 2018-06-25 02:20:06 You are right to speak of Norway's success outside of the EU (although it contributes to the EU budget). A small economy, its oil & gas revenues leverage the budget. The U.K. is heavily dependent on the services sector. The worry: Int'l companies may choose to relocate. Hope not.

5 Baby oil for some freak nasty stuff with or without you on our deserted island.
Interested?
9275 2018-06-25 02:13:45 I just bought some cocoa divine body oil gel and my god do I feel like I just waxed everywhere. The smell is so heavenly. Might be my new go to rather than lotion.

$usdcad = the Canadian retail sales number wet the bed at the end of the week but a spike in $oil turned a full panic rout into a broad based rally for the $cad.  Hell of a coincidence but hey... We have seen stranger.  We remain bearish for the Canadian dollar.
9286 2018-06-25 02:12:12 I’m mixing some 90 octane with oil right now, I’m riding my bike straight to you.
9287 2018-06-25 02:12:00 Pernah nyoba haple yang avocado oil, kalo buat bekas jerawat kayaknya ngga deh biasa aja. Tapi bagusnya kalo lagi pake muka berasa glowing

9289 2018-06-25 02:11:58 I hope that one day fusion energy will save us before all the oil runs out and the middle east can go back to where Aladdin and doner kebabs are from
9290 2018-06-25 02:11:46 Did you name that one Pounce D'oil Leon?
9291 2018-06-25 02:11:45 @Outback is a go to for @tanznirvana & I (#GlutenFree) on our #SummerTapTour. We just wish they had a vodka we could drink. Neither one of us can drink @TitosVodka because we are also #cornfree #soyfree Please ditch that oil blend & don’t roll the potatoes in soy oil either 
9292 2018-06-25 02:11:42 At the current rate, we will run out of oil in 53 years. Natural gas in 54 years. As resources deplete, they will become more expensive. NASCAR is not going to survive if it doesn’t evolve.
9293 2018-06-25 02:11:37 The Philippines could certainly benefit from lower oil prices.
9294 2018-06-25 02:11:30 Wet it and then oil it and gel lays it down.
9295 2018-06-25 02:10:59 Brother, I had someone steal CT's hanky from the pulpit at Bristol while he wasn't looking. I have it preserved in the freezer. Could you bring some of that oil, and I'll thaw out the hanky and squeeze that holy sweat into the oil. Could be the perfect revival formula.
9296 2018-06-25 02:10:50 Yes, it is called leaving it in the ground. Expedite the transition to renewable, sustainable energy. Oil is not the answer.
9297 2018-06-25 02:10:48 What the fuck man plastic is a finite material why dump it when it's reusable and you're gonna have to collect it later anyway when oil runs out.
9298 2018-06-25 02:10:36 Hmm understandable.. try tea tree or vitamin E oil.
9299 2018-06-25 02:10:31 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
9300 2018-06-25 02:10:22 Sadly, you don't seem to understand the amount of oil used to create your phone, keep Twitter powered, etc. You're using oil with every tweet. You're taking to trash me by using the very product you claim to hate. you're either a hypocrite or just dumb.
9301 2018-06-25 02:10:16 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
9302 2018-06-25 02:10:13 For me, I would pick "elemental" where I can control all kind of Elements. So I can clean up the environment and actually fix Flint's water problem for once. Even make oil to be solid forever so we can put end of the global warming.
9303 2018-06-25 02:10:03 You put olive oil, salt, pepper and parmesan flakes inside the lettuce and grill for 2 mins. Eat like an ice berg wedge. Amazing.

9309 2018-06-25 02:09:10 Former oil by rail exporter here. Unfortunately all@solutions are being shit down and hissed at. We need the necessary infrastructure to free our rail roads for other goods. It is causing bottle necks
9310 2018-06-25 02:09:07 Who you been taking to.
9311 2018-06-25 02:09:03 I think it is time for Canada to declare energy sovereignty. Let’s add the last piece of the puzzle: refineries. We have the oil, natural gas and electricity. Let’s not be held hostage over some gasoline. Demand that Canadian oil companies refine our own oil.
9312 2018-06-25 02:09:03 How are oil prices rising when OPEC says they will raise production? Doesn’t make sense to me. 
9313 2018-06-25 02:09:01 Viper seems like a supply chain management type professor to me, if he can turn out albums at that rate imagine if he was in charge of a oil rig or somethin
9314 2018-06-25 02:08:56 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9315 2018-06-25 02:08:47 Remember when Canada sheltered our citizens after 9/11, when they couldn't come back to the USA when planes were diverted?
Remember how many Canadians have fought in OUR WARS FOR OIL?
Remember how many Canadians were on the ground, helping us after Katrina?

Irrelevant, my ass.
9316 2018-06-25 02:08:26 That would be becuz Big Oil, Big Coal and Big Dino Fuel Utilities “are battling their customers over solar, and typically trying to undermine customers that want to cut their energy bills by installing solar… “  and Net Metering  - Clean Technica
9317 2018-06-25 02:08:23 Oil spreads are saying something about the market. I don't think its just syncrude. I think the oil market is super susceptible to supply shocks.

9322 2018-06-25 02:08:01 Oils(like the oils in your skin) and oil(the fossil fuel) are distinct. Burning the second is accepted to pollute the environment.

9324 2018-06-25 02:07:53 and lets just say for now that they signed a secret treaty with big oil in order to monopolize my HOOCH

9326 2018-06-25 02:07:16 No thanks. I'd rather stick my face in a blender than listen to the insane ramblings of anyone taken in by the snake oil peddler trump. It's not edgy, it's just wilfully and painfully ignorant.

9330 2018-06-25 02:06:55 Coal and oil are the future!  Say the real #idiots.
9331 2018-06-25 02:06:54 We keep a huge vat of anointing oil too, it draws a lot of bugs. Brother Hal’s old ford was knocking last week and we put a quart of that oil in it and God took that knock away. I say it’s worth it!
9332 2018-06-25 02:05:51 It is not illegal to seek asylum and the number of rapes committed by white locals far exceeds any crimes from refugees. You are told who to hate by the corporate media,  The real criminals are the Western governments killing tens of millions for gas and oil.

Before the trading week really gets started let's get a "State of Play" update.

$Oil = dropping.. The hype from last week wearing off.

$usdjpy = dropping pretty sharply.  Unsurprisingly not affecting $gold positively.  Expect this trade to hit a bottom and bounce.
9334 2018-06-25 02:05:25 Could've used a little oil on the wig, but it's alright. It's just fine.
9335 2018-06-25 02:05:20 I always say there is nothing worse than a white liberal
9336 2018-06-25 02:05:10 CO2? My dude, pollution isn’t just about that. It’s about stuff like destroying drinking water, happening on the oil pipeline.
9337 2018-06-25 02:05:09 You give me giggles.   Be well and happy.
9338 2018-06-25 02:05:04 this coconut oil really working wonders on my skin. i see so much progress
9339 2018-06-25 02:04:59 ขอบพระคุณมากๆนะคะ  ดีใจจังค่ะ #นุชกับยูยู่คือเพื่อนกัน
9340 2018-06-25 02:04:26 yeah, because the keystone pipeline didn’t leak 210,000 gallons of oil just months ago
9341 2018-06-25 02:03:57 Light and Oil man rubbing shoulders.
6 of one 1/2 doz of the other...
9342 2018-06-25 02:03:15 Is he out to destroy every single thing?  So nothing works?  He reminds me Of  Saddam Hussein exiting Kuwait,  blowing up all the oil fields on the way out. Wanton , unnecessary distruction
9343 2018-06-25 02:03:12 Donald, you forget that your Alaska pipeline crosses Canada and a lot of your potable water comes from pipelines across Canada. If I remember correctly valves turned to the left stop the liquid flow.  No oil and how long before a portion of the US dries up.
9344 2018-06-25 02:03:11 Oil pipelines
9345 2018-06-25 02:03:10 Yolanda done came through and put some oil on that Anita Baker Tribute#BETAwards

9347 2018-06-25 02:03:08 Just a touch more olive oil

9349 2018-06-25 02:02:45 OILY SKIN
-use oil free face wash! 
-wash once in the morning, with soap and once at night with cleanser.
-steer clear from toners or any astringents! 
-exfoliate 2/3 times a week.
-moisturize with lightweight, oil free moisturizer.
9350 2018-06-25 02:02:31 Oil industry making taking commendable steps under this Government. Congratulations.
9351 2018-06-25 02:02:23 Hey.. just made it up. Sautéed garlic, onion first, add lentils.. then red pepper, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, spinach, chopped tomatoes... boil, drain bow tie pasta then add to sautéed veggies... be generous with olive oil, cook medium heat.. season to taste!
9352 2018-06-25 02:02:22 Kuda merah still change the oil

9354 2018-06-25 02:02:17 So bad third session of DND today:
Went from sea to small town
From small town to cave
At the cave was attacked by a large (400+) flock of seagulls
Used flour and two flasks of oil caused a huge explosion and torched/scattered all of them
9355 2018-06-25 02:02:05 GENERAL TIPS! 
-eat and drink healthy! Hydrate to ensure healthy looking and feeling skin
 -try to use water based makeup! “nonacnegenic” or “noncomedogenic” will make sure that it’s oil free and won’t block your pores! 
-clean your pillowcases/phone/makeup brushes!
9356 2018-06-25 02:02:02 Yolanda got anointing oil dripping off the mic
9357 2018-06-25 02:02:01 The American Leftist so called environmentalists thinking:
Let’s block a easy, and safe way to transport oil (pipeline), and instead have it moved all over the  country by Train .  #idiots

9358 2018-06-25 02:01:44 I bought a glade scented oil air freshener like an ADULT so basically it’s over for you bitches
9359 2018-06-25 02:01:39 Antifreeze in the oil pan of my 65 C10? 

It's more likely than you think!
9360 2018-06-25 02:01:35 A product of Big Oil which obstructs any environmental protections from it.
9361 2018-06-25 02:01:14 My boyfriend really stole my tea tree oil and peppermint spray for his hair. Wow. My scalp bout dry af.

9366 2018-06-25 02:00:42 YOYO GOT THAT OIL BOY WHOOOOOOOOOOOO
9367 2018-06-25 02:00:37 “Getting”?
9368 2018-06-25 02:00:30 Like me and Yolanda Adams alone in a room with a stack of Bibles, a church fan and some anointing oil....
9369 2018-06-25 02:00:27 Dear sweet precious infant baby Jesus in a newly put together IKEA manger. Yolanda Adams is PURE BLACK EXCELLENCE and her singing "You Bring Me Joy" father give me the blessed oil #BETAwards
9370 2018-06-25 01:59:44 Have mercy, that  body plus oil...that going to be a nice dream tonight 
9371 2018-06-25 01:59:06 Just a thought you want to save the earth environment start move oil safest way it's called  pipeline first West then consider the constituents East. Save the planet make a start.
9372 2018-06-25 01:59:03 can't even see the thread anymore because she blocked me lol, but if i think she said something like men only like dark skinned women if they're covered in oil or something  which isn't true, but typically it's models that are oiled up, so I just asked, no assumptions
9373 2018-06-25 01:58:39 I brew a cup every morning. Need to get a Keurig. I use 2 tbsp Kerry Gold butter. 1 tbsp of MCT oil, though I use bulletproof brand. 1 tbsp of cream and a little squeeze of Stevia.
9374 2018-06-25 01:58:33 This peppermint oil got my scalp on 
9375 2018-06-25 01:58:20 How fortunate to have a sister who makes organic olive oil!
9376 2018-06-25 01:58:13 United States of America is soon to be independent on foreign oil petroleum 
We will no longer need Canadian crude oil which you are 100% dependent on US purchasing
 Your economy will also tank. See Trumps isolationist into fair trade tariffs
9377 2018-06-25 01:58:10 No, I’m saying correlation is not causation. Developed countries are also the ones that used Oil/coal, and generally increased its use while population expanded, medicine was improved, and generally became more advanced. Not actually connected.
9378 2018-06-25 01:58:10 Exactly! All the Middle East oil on one end, and a Pakistani poori on the other. Sadly, it's only a mild hyperbole.
9379 2018-06-25 01:58:08 The olive oil ecostyler is literally amazinggg

9382 2018-06-25 01:57:33 They looked like they have been dipped in the finest cocoa and shea butter with a hint of baby oil.
9383 2018-06-25 01:57:31 Kesh king hair oil produced this year's GA hence good hair category was  introduced. Like every year's boroplus face of the year :)
9384 2018-06-25 01:57:15 It has nothing to do with terrorists or WMDs. Hussein was going to try and exit the petro-dollar market and start buying and selling oil in their own currency. And the US couldn't allow that to happen. #QAnon
9385 2018-06-25 01:57:04 BFRASER747

You think your entitled?
Get Canada to do it!
9386 2018-06-25 01:57:02 Quality makes US even further from self-sufficient. Our shale oil results in no diesel when refined.
9387 2018-06-25 01:56:37 AND YOU SHOULD BE BOILED IN OIL YOU SOB
9388 2018-06-25 01:56:27 Idk bro kinda hate midland after i worked in the oil field
9389 2018-06-25 01:56:26 Empezaron comprando pétroleo venezolano que la refinería no podía refinar y el gas oil y nafta salían horrible, para arreglarlo en vez de volver al petróleo del golfo nos hicieron gastar en una desulfurizadora  300 palitos,  ahora lo mismo con el biodiesel de Alur,  QUE DESATRE
9390 2018-06-25 01:56:17 Yeah I've been drinking my echinacea infused herbal tea with some oil of oregano. My allergy meds haven't helped so i think I'm down and out with a legit cold 
9391 2018-06-25 01:56:09 We can help you an allocation of crude oil in Nigeria and Russian products
9392 2018-06-25 01:56:07 My 24” ratchet slipped off a truck’s oil plug today and my head hit the leaf spring bolt so hard I thought I gave myself a concussion
9393 2018-06-25 01:56:06 brush makeup: ga tau ga ada mereknya.

pembersih makeup: biore cleansing oil. Buat bersihin alat make up juga bisa.
makeup spray: pixy.
9394 2018-06-25 01:56:03 Tip: if you can’t sleep, get a spray bottle, fill it with a mix of cool water and a oil of your choice (try lavender if undecided) and spray it on the inside of your duvet (the bit that touches your skin) you’re welcome good night
9395 2018-06-25 01:55:59 YES!! I can’t be wiping my hands every time  the oil could fuel a whole car!!
9396 2018-06-25 01:55:32 An essential oil diffuser, a tea kettle (can be used for tea, Ramen, noodles ect.) a water filter, a laundry hamper, face masks for self care. BLACK OUT curtains to help with sleep. And most importantly, a power strip.
9397 2018-06-25 01:55:29 Except that oil is good for life-almost everything we use is based on oil products. Again, you make an assertion without facts
9398 2018-06-25 01:55:25 音域狭すぎだから歌えぬ…
9399 2018-06-25 01:55:22 LOVE & PATIENCE! and of course coconut oil & black castor oil
9400 2018-06-25 01:55:20 Do you actually buy it or just make your own 'Keto-proof' coffee with butter and MCT oil? I highly recommend the latter, if you're buying it pre-made.
9401 2018-06-25 01:55:02 Global Cues: Europe Closed Higher On Friday After OPEC Secured Deal On Oil Production
9402 2018-06-25 01:54:58 Brash and uncouth are what the country needed and most wanted. NO MORE snake oil salesmen or silver tongued LIARS!
9403 2018-06-25 01:54:42 They’re cooking us in our own oil.
9404 2018-06-25 01:54:27 I like having one tray feeder near the ground. 2-3 tube feeders with squirrel proof cages around them. One thistle feeder. Suet feeder. Bird bath with dripper. Black oil sunflower in everything and millet and cracked corn mixed in for the platform feeder.
9405 2018-06-25 01:54:25 So...you are dumb enough to advocate for a an oil trade war? Holy shit the man has had 6 bankruptcies and you are treating him like he's the best economic mind in the world. 

America can't stand alone against all others in a globalized world. Saudi Arabia won't bow to trump.
9406 2018-06-25 01:54:17 It  took me awhile to get into high fantasy (e.g., Wheel of  Time), but fully credit Earthsea series and Hero and the Crown series for most of my moral compass. Both are sick. Once tried mixing my own Kenet: it didn't work; it was a flame accelerator b/c I used oil 
9407 2018-06-25 01:54:07 Marsha got the coconut oil on them legs!!!
9408 2018-06-25 01:53:50 Drilling done responsibly is no big deal. Oil  naturally permeates out of the ocean floor all the time. As for fishing...some of the best fishing is around "structures"
9409 2018-06-25 01:53:49 UNITY Psalm 133 How good and how pleasant it is, when brothers dwell together as one! Like fine oil on the head, running down upon the beard, Upon the beard of Aaron, upon the collar of his robe. Like dew of Hermon  coming down upon the mountains of Zion.
9410 2018-06-25 01:52:48 I didn't SAY they were direct subsidies I said 3B were the other 46 are DOWNSTREAM costs associated with oil and gas that are a HIDDEN subsidy ... things like healthcare costs etc... and you are changing your tune ... last post you said they were a lie, now you nitpick
9411 2018-06-25 01:52:39 Profit from making the EPA as impotent as possible, because he can go back to an oil industry that directly benefits from the EPA’s loss of power?
I’m not google. The emoluments clause has been discussed. Go find it.
9412 2018-06-25 01:52:33 Peppermint oil on a sunburn  feels like heaven because it stops the sting
9413 2018-06-25 01:52:31 @pirateradio1250 Am I the only one looking at all these commits and thinking either Scotty is the best snake oil salesman on the planet or ECU is getting the death penalty in a few years?  Our record/performance, as of now, doesn’t warrant the recruiting success. But I’ll take it

9418 2018-06-25 01:50:52 Yeeees! Anita had them take the rollers out and tease it with a wide tooth comb and Isoplus Oil Sheen Tonight! 
9419 2018-06-25 01:50:33 Then nobody would work at McDonalds or pick the strawberries...  even worse toilet paper, lobster and food in general would cost $100/lbs. it’s economics. Finland tried to make everyone middle class it failed. Venezuela tried with its massive oil profits, it too failed
9420 2018-06-25 01:50:31 His meal tonight was sweet potatoes, green peas and a lamb and turkey mix. I’ve read to add cod liver oil, but I don’t have it, so I’ll buy it next time. I also have been feeding him pumpkin and goats milk.
9421 2018-06-25 01:50:21 But the Clampetts made their money with oil. 

The Bushes made their money with beans. 

So there are no other similarities.

9424 2018-06-25 01:49:38 Just found out that baking soda does indeed put out cooking oil fires  passing it on.
9425 2018-06-25 01:49:30 Was just riding one of my bikes a couple hours on asphalt bike lanes and paths and am quite happy that all this is made possible because of oil and gas production.  I might also add that the computers, phones and internet that the protestors use to promote their cause rely on oil

9429 2018-06-25 01:49:10 Pain relievers literally dont work on my menstrual cramps anymore. Like legit, the only option I have left is to depend my life on the minty oil I used to criticize, when my grandma told me it somehow relieves pain.
9430 2018-06-25 01:48:41 Attention Dem. voters: voting Democrat you lose your tax break, you lose the North Korea deal, go back to Iran deal, stop oil production, reinstate all horrible Obama regulations, all the great economy we now have, lose your job hi unemployment more?

9432 2018-06-25 01:48:27 Heavy fuel oil, reportedly. And, I assume those are oil spill response vessels in the photo, trying to contain the oil and stop it from spreading.
9433 2018-06-25 01:48:26 see if we had pipelines that oil would not have spilled  in Iowa
9434 2018-06-25 01:48:16 India, China, Australia and much of Europe is chasing after the solution of renewable energy.  Americans are chasing after accidents, and finding them, oil slicks, dirty air and water!

9441 2018-06-25 01:47:31 You are pretty smart working in ND. You must have a monopoly of well moneyed lonely oil workers there. Kudo to you.
9442 2018-06-25 01:47:22 You mean policies like opening up drilling in Arctic Wildlife Refuge even though our dependence on foreign oil went way down under Obama.
9443 2018-06-25 01:47:17 Under Trudeau...

9447 2018-06-25 01:47:04 I wouldn’t want to trust a cigarette company to give me honest data on the health issues associated with cigarettes. In fact, what happened with cigarettes is basically what Oil is doing. Oil is just better at lobbying.

9451 2018-06-25 01:46:09 Are you using an oil based clay? If not, that may help you patch the cracks. If you already are, you may be about to re-hydrate your material using cooking oil, mineral oil, or another product to soften clay. I hope you find something that works- super rad sculpt!
9452 2018-06-25 01:46:05 Part of this too was inspired by a photo from a Scottish montano side, and I elaborated an extension of it while adding the horse, with some vocal guidance from a fellow student at the time who is a fantastic oil painter and she favored horses in her pieces—Myself, a Landscape!

9464 2018-06-25 01:44:32 so a few months ago I talked about my SO having 16 different bottles of olive oil in the cabinet; today he went grocery shopping and bought a new bottle of olive oil and I found a half-used bottle of the exact same product, same brand and everything, in the cabinet

9471 2018-06-25 01:43:03 i have a really dry scalp so the oil helps a lot and the masques are just for definition/texture
9472 2018-06-25 01:43:00 You can, with some oil and soap, but simpler to just pick and drown them.
9473 2018-06-25 01:42:28 My mom is trying to sell me on using coconut oil. No thanks.
9474 2018-06-25 01:42:23 In Norway the macroeconomic context is an extremely strong external sector feeding through into the domestic economy. So, the Norwegian Govt imposes relatively higher taxes, particularly on oil, and has set up a sovereign wealth fund. They are both means to control inflation.

9478 2018-06-25 01:41:50 I spilled my sensible coconut oil ALL over my credit cards! Is this a sign
9479 2018-06-25 01:41:50 Is it possible, the congress decides they have gotten all they want out out of this snake oil salesman, hang their hats on the Mueller Report and impeach trump to save themselves or their majorities this November.
9480 2018-06-25 01:41:32 Imagine if I had mates who dared me to do things like shotting olive oil and sniffing the salt when I have tequila when we’re all drunk. Oh wait I do. It’s a wonder I haven’t fucked my nose or made myself sick 
9481 2018-06-25 01:41:17 Totally get it. Re: chips--bake them yourself. Just toss with olive oil, s&p (and some chili pepper flakes). Such a good snack!

9485 2018-06-25 01:40:51 paying a million for an ounce of oil is racism
9486 2018-06-25 01:40:50 well dang. I have never tried masques or tea tree oil before especially the masques. Do they work really well?

9488 2018-06-25 01:40:45 @robertmaguire Thank you for validating everything I've come to believe about the LEFT.
9489 2018-06-25 01:40:38 Yeah keep being delusional. Just remember your achievements were funded by oil and it's drying up. Europa league next season, and playing in a training ground proves it. Chelsea FC = small team. Enough said.

9491 2018-06-25 01:40:35 Also if you’re concerned about those white bugs, they’re call Aphids! You can get rid of them with Neem oil or a water and soap spray every 2 days for like... 2 weeks :) OR buy some lady bugs as they nom on the little pests lol

9500 2018-06-25 01:39:06 @PamLukas3 Said it b4. If trump had his way there'd be an oil rig in everybody's back yard. All the parks would be coal mines n there'd be a wall around the whole Country.

9502 2018-06-25 01:38:49 Epsom salt soak and coconut oil rub down got me all the way together
9503 2018-06-25 01:38:45 i ran out of tea tree oil and my conditioners/masques so i’m dead
9504 2018-06-25 01:38:32 Nope. China has an interest in a big, independant EU and a strong Euro though. Long term to decouple oil from the dollar. Rather two big blocks than one giant west.
9505 2018-06-25 01:38:06 If it we're truly a WITCH HUNT, he would have already been hanged, boiled in oil, and/or burned at the stake.

9517 2018-06-25 01:36:40 Transformer oil is toxic to people.
It’s the same as cooking with mineral oil.
9518 2018-06-25 01:36:09 Climate change was created by the progressive movement in order to arbitrarily restrict the natural resources industries in America. we have a great bounty of them. They could never destroy the US if we were allowed to freely access all of our oil, gas, coal, timber, metals, etc.
9519 2018-06-25 01:35:50 I cant tell if I'm shiny from oil or highlight

9524 2018-06-25 01:35:33 @BucharestGrill Regular customer in Detroit, Love your Shawarmas! Please consider using paper bags instead of aluminium foil. I realize that paper bags would soak up oil but some of us are okay with that. At the very least make paper bags an option. Thanks!
9525 2018-06-25 01:35:19 trump is pulling his famous" get them confused "crap with opec tweeting step up production so we can keep prices down he wants less production and higher prices the oil companies want it and trump must give them what they want
9526 2018-06-25 01:35:15 You can use CBD oil (derived from Hemp) which has no trace of any psychoactive effects of THC, which gives you the high for dogs! When people hear the word "Hemp" they think marijuana.
9527 2018-06-25 01:35:10 Apparently Johnsons Baby Creamy Oil is a mosquito repellent!
9528 2018-06-25 01:35:07 What do you use? I mostly use coconut oil, castor oil and almond oil.
9529 2018-06-25 01:34:52 14. Tea Tree Oil. Tea tree oil bersifat anti fungi. Cara penggunaannya juga sangat mudah. Cukup masukkan satu sendok makan tea tree oil dan dicampur dengan satu secangkir air hangat. Kemudian semprotkan pada area kepala.
9530 2018-06-25 01:34:43 IA livestock producers have many times been severely fined for letting as little as several hundred gallons of manure get to a stream. Hoping @IAGovernor will see that Iowa DNR & EPA hold BNSF fully responsible for the 20 semi loads (120,000 gallons) of uncontrolled crude oil.
9531 2018-06-25 01:34:10 I can’t stop thinking about that episode of Queer Eye where Antoni used like half a bottle of olive oil to make a green goddess smoothie

9536 2018-06-25 01:33:11 For those keeping track, we are up to 1938 in the Trump administration reenacting the third Reich. I wonder which country will be invaded, or if it will be a civil war so Russia can get control of the oil in Texas. Care to place bets?

9545 2018-06-25 01:31:56 YES!! It's so good! You cook the food, they put a thing of oil on the stove in the middle of the table & you choose your meats & veggies & you can do a cheese dip too! It's DELICIOUS! & they can show you what to do, too! & the dessert... OMG

Sorry couldn't tell you look young. Law requires licences. I'm not para but prepared. No one infringes my A2
9552 2018-06-25 01:30:45 Stretch daily and take fish oil for joints
9553 2018-06-25 01:30:30 I'd pay more attention to this motley group, if they spent even a tiny portion of their time and US $$, being concerned with Russia, Saudi, Venezuela,Nigeria and Iran oil production/transportation issues (there are many). But that might interfere with their income and lifestyles.
9554 2018-06-25 01:30:28 Trump is already bullying Putin by undercutting his oil market. 
Didn't know that did you?

What is stopping Canada is transportation costs. 
Oil is more highly profitable when your customer is on the doorstep.
9555 2018-06-25 01:30:25 The black material vertically cross-cutting sed layering is probably solid bitumen. Internet says coal here is bituminous so it is in the oil window. BTW Kerogen III refers to woody orgo matter. Age of Shag Point coals is Latest Cretaceous. 2/

9557 2018-06-25 01:29:54 Saudi Arabia is on the wrong side of history. The kings love money, oil and America freedom . 
The turkey have cross the Arab land and come to Mogadishu on difficult time, while Arabs didn't want to help, but busy building towers for America in Dubai. 

Turkey is Real Islam

9560 2018-06-25 01:29:43 I've already addressed most of those so called "subsidies." As for the 2 involving oil shale, oil shale accounts for <15 MBPD of us production and I don't know much about it. Its really irrelevant.  EOR and, to a lesser extent, % depletion are the only real subsides on the list.
9561 2018-06-25 01:29:43 Even more so with alarmists.  Grant funded academics, Gov tax/control officials, and snake oil salesmen should always worry you

9564 2018-06-25 01:29:24 Fair enough but the "right" is not always anti decarbonization
A lot of the government that signed to the Paris accord were conservative
The problem is with those lacking basic math skills (Doug, Trump), or those paid by big oil (Bush)
China & even Saudi investing in renewable
9565 2018-06-25 01:29:23 Also.... I use coconut oil in hair mask treatments, to cook with, etc. it has many uses and works wonderful

9571 2018-06-25 01:28:37 Can we drill oil off the coast of NC safely?   If so, would it create jobs and lower prices?
9572 2018-06-25 01:28:30 Of course. So were we, before oil man came in. And a lot more cups than you guys achieved. What's your point? Roman gave you more success than you had in your entire history in the space of a few years. That must be a sheer coincidence, right?

9596 2018-06-25 01:24:34 Moroccan oil! I rub a few drops into the ends after washing and it has made my hair grow v fast (for me) and become v shiny. (But don't put it too close to your roots because it can weigh the hair down/make it oily.)
9597 2018-06-25 01:24:28 The "egos" can't make the narrative work, because the literally are incapable of stepping back, letting go, and look at their problems and mistake objectively.  Crazy, powerful people living in an echo chamber; one they made up.

9600 2018-06-25 01:24:10 Yes, bio fuels are absolutely terrible and don’t solve anything. They frequently create more issues than they solve. 

Big oil has fought against real solutions for decades such as nuclear, wind, solar and geothermal. They also fought against MPG requirements on vehicles.

9611 2018-06-25 01:20:48 Brent crude oil prices fell by more than 2 per cent early on Monday as traders factored in an expected output increase that was agreed at the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna on Friday. ~ BT
9612 2018-06-25 01:20:32 Olive oil has worked wonders on various substances mine have gotten onto themselves- white out, paint, and tape of many varieties tape stickiness.
9613 2018-06-25 01:20:20 If I may add, the powerful OPEC internal infighting and increased U.S. & Canada oil production posed a major threat to them. So to kill the competition, OPEC dropped the price from over $100 to $40/barrel. The surplus Harper anticipated literally became a deficit overnight.

9621 2018-06-25 01:18:48 I'm debating wether to keep my chickens and other animals after the community center.

9622 2018-06-25 01:18:39 I have my dogs on cannabis oil. What's wrong with that?
9623 2018-06-25 01:18:36 This is sadly one of the wimpy ones, with a 1.8L QG18DE engine.

That said, other than the oil filter, I have found it pretty easy to work on, and it's still saving me gas money at 170K miles.
9624 2018-06-25 01:18:20 D oil u use for jerking off is still remaining I gues
9625 2018-06-25 01:18:07 I agree...100%. Its difficult knowing at 50 he's living in captivity but to know he's well-cared for and given more space. It's tough but sadly he'd probably not lived as long in the wild w/palm oil taking their lands. I like to think he's an ambassador for orangutans.

9638 2018-06-25 01:14:53 1) Correct.  But in 1996, Congress created expedited removal for undocumented immigrants without a hearing. Initially it only applied at the U.S. border. Then it was expanded to within 100 miles of a border for illegal aliens who have been in the country less than 14 days.
9639 2018-06-25 01:14:41 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Stephen Miller began drilling for oil in Chuck Schumer. But her emails!

9642 2018-06-25 01:14:20 Dogs or any animal shouldn’t eat weed or be forced to smoke weed but CBD oil can be used for their arthritic pain or other things.

There is no telling the variety of clean energy sources we would have today if it weren’t for their greed and desire to keep us stuck on oil.
9648 2018-06-25 01:13:14 Maybe someone will setup an oil rig just offshore of Mar-A-Lago.
9649 2018-06-25 01:12:53 They want everyone driving cars and burning gas made from their oil.

9699 2018-06-25 01:05:17 Nothing changed, Alberta was still earning major oil revenues. The fact that it only opens up every 4 years demands that all affected parties have a voice. Trudeau took that away. Rachael Notley hasn’t uttered 1 word!

9756 2018-06-25 00:54:57 Al Falih stated he would feel bad if Saudi Arabia had more than 2 mb/d of idle capacity. Why keep more than 2 mb/d idle as spare capacity was his question. Something oil bulls may need to digest and get used to when they keep saying spare capacity in the oil market should be 5%

9788 2018-06-25 00:50:43 High oil prices also lead to increased costs for raising corn, wheat and soy beans and all crops because oil byproducts are a main component in fertilizer. Additionally, our government heavily subsidizes corn for ethanol production, a component of gas.

9790 2018-06-25 00:50:39 CW is a CBD oil that can be purchased online and mailed from Colorado. It was featured on CNN. Dr. Gedde is a doctor in Colorado Springs that now has a practice strictly based on CBD and Epilepsy. SQ788 is an issue but would not stop the purchase of CW.
9791 2018-06-25 00:50:35 This is getting out of hand. The left has gone off the deep end. Politicians are snake oil salesmen but they are advocating civil unrest? They are pitting citizens against citizens now. This is going to get out of control if they don’t stop
9792 2018-06-25 00:50:34 And of course, with this one the shaking motion caused the lumpia to fling back into the pot of oil, splashing oil hot enough to deep fry in all over my hand. I immediately ran over to the sink and started running cold water over it, and called for my mom.

9812 2018-06-25 00:47:16 When I was 15 or so, my mom got a bag of frozen lumpia from a customer at the bank she worked at. I was the only one who cooked in my house, so I was frying them up in oil in a dutch oven.

9827 2018-06-25 00:43:37 In April, U.S. Department of Agriculture said food prices rose 8.2 percent in 2017. We export more food, decreasing domestic supply. Oil prices increased = higher shipping costs passed on to consumers. Globally people eat more meat = higher grain prices to feed livestock & so on
9828 2018-06-25 00:43:36 They still have lots of ammo. Saudi is merely doing 0.6 mb/d out of a total spare capacity of 2 mb/d. Neutral zone can be restarted as well to add to capacity. Thanks OPEC for clarifying the 1 mb/d over the weekend, much needed relief for oil consumers.

9846 2018-06-25 00:40:46 I remember commercials in the 80's taking about Venezuela sending oil to America for poor people. Something about "Thanks to our friends in Venezuela". I was young, so it's hard to remember exact details.

9849 2018-06-25 00:40:29 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
9850 2018-06-25 00:40:29 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

What is the overall mg concentration after I mix 70% 300 mg and 30% 100mg?

9858 2018-06-25 00:38:44 Corn is a grain and it's fried (popped)in vegetable oil which is terrible and overall a bad choice. Follow @VinnieTortorich he is the man.

9863 2018-06-25 00:37:44 Maintenance.... it takes time to do hair and to avoid putting and immense amount of heat or unnecessary product in our hair we braid it down oil it up and put on the hair
9864 2018-06-25 00:37:20 Let me get this straight @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @funder ..Regime allows destruction of air and water, fragile environments to benefit coal, oil, chemical companies. Regime builds interment camps in the desert for 10s of thousands of POC... And our CONGRESS sits on its hands 3/3
9865 2018-06-25 00:37:02 You tweeted over the internet from a phone or computer. Do you realize how much oil it took to make that happen? Hypocrite.
9866 2018-06-25 00:36:54 But you're always reminded the oil one works right

9872 2018-06-25 00:35:55 They created a monster they can no longer control.  And they knew they were doing it.
9873 2018-06-25 00:35:47 I just came to watch people use a phone or computer to tweet a message over the internet about how bad oil is. Yet they don't realized how much oil it takes to make that simple action they took a reality.

9879 2018-06-25 00:35:02 I understand where you’re coming from, and I don’t necessarily disagree, but the fact of the matter is, as it was said in @VeepHBO, don't "fuck with oil” because “they fuck in a very unpleasant fashion.”

9936 2018-06-25 00:26:54 I only do it rarely cause it's not good for you but when I do it it's either coconut or peanut oil.
9937 2018-06-25 00:26:51 Yeah, I think that's an only you could get away with that strategy.  The rest of us not so much.
9938 2018-06-25 00:26:39 It's just how children are.
9939 2018-06-25 00:26:36 What’s interesting is, the oil industry has basically given the fight up and accepted the science. But the people they paid to confuse are still fighting.
9940 2018-06-25 00:25:50 Ya...maybe someone could invent something you could put underground to move oil so rail cars don't have to move it. Say something like a pipe.

9945 2018-06-25 00:25:25 People are just starting to get their medical bills. Oil hit $69 a barrel. Tax break was minimal and is actually going to reduce next year’s refund. Mexico is NOT paying for a wall, and Russia is going to CONtrol and dominate US. Everyone is getter mad and mean.
9946 2018-06-25 00:25:22 Lots more going on in this country besides that. Kidnapped children, the cuts to SS Medicare and Medicaid that so many of us depend on, opening our coasts and public open spaces to oil drilling

9968 2018-06-25 00:21:26 While I agree, they’re no match for Oil Companies. I mean, look at 9/11. Our government needed a reason/excuse to go into the Middle East in order to stop Saddam from switching from the Petrol Dollar to the Petrol Euro. We didn’t go into Iraq looking for WMDs.
9969 2018-06-25 00:21:21 There's little political discourse regarding climate change, land-use change, mining, water management, oil production or environmental impact assessment during this election.

They voted for him, now they see #Oil trumps crawfish and the #environment. If @RepClayHiggins is pro Trump then he is pro oil and not pro crawfishermen...

9987 2018-06-25 00:19:49 What kind of moisturizer so you use? You should use a more hydrating moisturizer bc your skin is over compensating for the lack of oil
9988 2018-06-25 00:19:23 Took 3 hours but got it off with olive oil and a soap meant for mechanics... bunch of random bald spots now lol but better than the alternative. Now I gotta take my bike apart and clean the gears and what not too, got everywhere

9997 2018-06-25 00:17:34 Question - do u make your vape oil in cartridges that I can use with my o.pen vape batteries? Or can I vape your cbd oil in a concentrates vaporothat I already own?
9998 2018-06-25 00:17:34 I'm still not sure why it's an either-or situation.

In regards to both meat and plants an underlying issue is over consumption.

Naturally certain seasons would provide certain availability and we would have more balanced diets.

There would be much lower consumption of oil

10004 2018-06-25 00:16:47 So we were rebooked on another flight which was also canceled due to an "oil like substance" leaking into the cabin. Are you guys going out of business? #fingerscrossed
10005 2018-06-25 00:16:30 Really? Melania's jacket, who's eating in Mexi restaurants and children being taken away from parents. The only important thing there is the children and even they are being used to distract from healthcare, ocean oil drilling and cuts to food stamps. But hey, not my country.
10006 2018-06-25 00:16:30 No but you problely use  baby oil though huh
