1 2018-03-23 23:59:48 Definitely agree with you.
2 2018-03-23 23:59:32 Watching this $STORM pump happen on @UPbitExchange is/was simply amazing. What a volume those koreans can create.. A sneakpeak of the altseason maybe?  #Storm #Alts #Crypto #Blockchain
3 2018-03-23 23:59:30 How about “no but will be bullish”?

11 2018-03-23 23:58:44 2/2  TLDR , could you post more of those as much as possible lol.  But also, its probably going to drive me to pay for tradingview.  sigh, lol.

15 2018-03-23 23:58:07 If I had gotten into crypto in my first year of PhD, I would have quit the program. Now that I'm almost finished, I'm lucky that my committe is visionary enough to allow me to write my dissertation in crypto-marketplace design.
16 2018-03-23 23:57:59 1/2  I'm becoming a huge believer in what you said about 1month ago.  6h BTCUSD is the most reliable chart, overtaking the 4 or the 1d. Problem is for us tradingview free plebs, custom 360 interval is not an option.  Nor is volume profile on the righthand side...
17 2018-03-23 23:57:49 Thank you! 
18 2018-03-23 23:57:44 You're one of my favourite crypto devs. Just so you know.

46 2018-03-25 23:58:22 Yep can’t fault your arguments, problem is to invest (I don’t trade) I don’t see much potential buying BNB now compared to Qash. I also feel Binance are top for now so where can they go, perhaps keep growing but perhaps lose dominance, Quoine feel like a compressed spring to me.
47 2018-03-25 23:58:17 I guess you might just give back $390k next time and keep your 10k as was agreed - that’s shameful BUT now u know for next time. If nothing else you have the benefit of knowing u did the right thing - although for the wrong people.

81 2018-03-25 23:55:34 There is a big difference between regulating investments in crypto currency and regulation of cryptocurrency itself.  The former is necessary - the latter is a futile effort that would only create chaos and controversy.  What about crypto needs regulations?
82 2018-03-25 23:55:32 You miss my point. Reread. I'm saying it's absurd to think that most suspected criminals will plan their communication strategy around strong crypto. No inconsistency at all.
