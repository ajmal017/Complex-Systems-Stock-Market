$WDAY, $VMW, $TEAM, $RHT, $NOW, $SAP
131 2019-05-16 22:45:39 Bahi i have check on the stocks app and on google too. Believe me its 141.61 yet.
132 2019-05-16 22:44:34 Funny you mention sinking ships. How did phun ever get involved with Stellar. Those Greek shippers are something else and their stocks kind of look like $phun chart
133 2019-05-16 22:43:35 apple stocks rise by 20%.
134 2019-05-16 22:42:08 Yesss!! @TheHelenSquires @hannahkhbr @emilyjclark_x @veeveeverona @stephkastevens @Morag_Davies @Sophie_Bone_ @Sophiehodges123
135 2019-05-16 22:41:38 I’m asking what different between these and stocks lol are they just painter and lighter like sti ones?
136 2019-05-16 22:41:29 Disagree - Cameco went up to 16$ and now down to 13$. $PLU was up to 1.20 and now back down to 0.47. Many false starts for stocks and almost all are down. Can't wait for some positive news / movement. Still looking to 2020 for the bull to start.
137 2019-05-16 22:40:33 Heard it all before, when Harold Wilson’s Labour Government won, when Tony Blair’s Labour Government won.  
What happened was: the days before and after the election saw little market movement.  Then stocks rose, because the economic policies brought growth, hope and investment.
138 2019-05-16 22:38:47 “If you see a bandwagon, it means you’ve missed it” These stocks rely on continuing subsidies. Good luck with that..
139 2019-05-16 22:37:26 O Brasil é o centro do universo, os gringos vão se matar para investir no IBOV,  em um país com junk stocks e risco cambial

O P/E ratio das empresas do IBOV vai disparar, com 1% de cresc. do PIB nos próximos anos

149 2019-05-16 22:27:10 If the large bulk handlers in Australia made the stocks public knowledge, rather than keeping them to themselves maybe this issue could have been avoided. No one apart from them actually knows how much grain is in there storage’s.

159 2019-05-16 22:17:18 Right now it’s too dangerous to play China centric stocks $BABA $BA $NVDA etc.  One sector that is less or not  dependent on China is $XBI.  Moves like this NVDA after hours action will bring a $ to bio.  Specially as ASCO is just around the corner.    What is your favorite bio?
160 2019-05-16 22:15:26 #bbcqt is such a good program; but it goes a long way to rile people up who are just about to go to bed. I regularly dream of putting politicians in stocks and applying custard pies to their face. Coincidently usually on a Thursday night.

176 2019-05-16 22:04:38 There are some similarities b/w 1957 low in gold stocks and the 2016 low (extreme valuations, macro, position of stock market). 

From 1957 to 1987 market peak, the S&P 500 did 7.7%/yr.

Gold Stocks did 13%/yr. 40x over 30 years.

180 2019-05-16 22:02:33 $OSTK something is not convincing..CEO selling at rock bottom and well aware of 60% short interest of the float. He didn’t sell when it reached 90 or 60. He still owns 8M restricted and 1M from float. So he owns 9M stocks..Selling 500K May be a bait to buy from float.. #Bullish

"Divestment causes money to 'flow out of' the sector’s stocks".

No. It's an accounting tautology. For every $ "divested" *EXACTLY* the same amount of $ gets *IN*vested.

251 2019-05-16 21:17:09 Glad you're interested in this, thanks.  Most "mainstream" reps. avoid it like the plague, but it's so obvious I think that's irresponsible.  One doesn't have to be a nut to recognize CBs hoover up stocks when it's in their reports & the CME publicizes it, for example.
252 2019-05-16 21:16:58 There is a business lesson here. Junior developers often get put on "simple" projects, but simple does not correlate with importance of correctness.

Put those developers on the useless space-filling built-ins, like the Stocks app. Better yet, have structured training!

I don't think "the powers that be" manipulate every tick, but they watch important levels & trends like a hawk IMO.  Why would CBs buy stocks?  We're also in a currency war so Fx probably the most manipulated around

271 2019-05-16 21:05:50 You're correct, it does.  But what markets do you think one could trade that are not manipulated?  Not stocks, precious metals, oil, FX or fixed income....maybe less psychologically important/ smaller commodities or smaller/ emerging market stock markets?

342 2019-05-16 20:23:38 Yes, during a bubble it makes sense, but as soon as they bubble collapses you’ll lose your money which is why it’s dumb. That’s why I didn’t invest in dot com stocks in the 90s and I sold my stock in yahoo! When they acquired my startup. It was dumb.

410 2019-05-16 19:49:54 Stocks represent ownership in a real business. I am a net buyer of ownership interests in real businesses. If automated selling gets triggered that's great for me!  I'd much rather buy AT&T at a yield of 20% than 6% all other things equal.

413 2019-05-16 19:45:34 A majority of my wealth is in real-estate.  But I still have about 20% in the market (stocks & ETFs). My stock portfolio is up over 20% in 2019. An anolomy, sure... but long-term wealth is all about capturing that alpha when you can!

415 2019-05-16 19:45:04 I once traded at a small firm in Manhattan. There was one trader who was excellent at trading slow-moving stocks. He rarely had a down day, and on average made about $500 a day. Small potatoes but a decent living. He left trading when the market became too volatile (in 2007).
416 2019-05-16 19:44:31 A7: If you open an investment account and buy a few stocks for them (such as, index funds or individual stocks) it can teach them compound interest #wbchat
417 2019-05-16 19:44:02 The hedging is not for retailers; index PUTs don’t work if you have alpha insensitive stocks or defensive stocks. Kindly read your stocks,size and hedge.  Hedge only if it’s protecting
418 2019-05-16 19:43:51 One thought: decision making of global capital about whether to invest more, or less, in US stocks might be getting more stretched, more divided. Inward bound and outward bound waves are bigger, hastier. Also agree your levels will make decision making even more urgent.
419 2019-05-16 19:43:36 That time when the news about Kyungsoo leaving dropped, the stocks decreased and it was ONLY one member (and only a rumor) what's gonna happen when SM decides it's time for EXO to say goodbye? You think that company will last?

432 2019-05-16 19:37:15 This. 

Stock market volatility says u could make 15%/yr, or lose -8%. It is a truism over the long run, stocks hv a slightly better return. But long term is like 30 years! My guess is Joseph doesn't have 100% of his money invested in stocks for precisely this volatility.

474 2019-05-16 19:13:24 When it comes to investing in the stock market the "why" matters just as much as the "how". Many people get into stocks for a lot of different reasons and sometimes those reasons are not always the smartest.
475 2019-05-16 19:13:03 China sent minions (aka capital flight, shell companies) around world with printed Yuan (garbage) turned into USD 2 pump asset prices (real estate, stocks,etc).

523 2019-05-16 18:54:57 Web To Door (SPRV) hopefully will be assessed by Wall Street professionals and individual investors alike for stock price to soar to a very high price and management follows up with a stock dividend and stock split for LOYAL shareholders??AMEN to this!!!!
524 2019-05-16 18:54:37 @getlametric Hello! Could you look into adding support for multiple stocks in the stock app and Wall Street style scrolling? Thank you :)
525 2019-05-16 18:54:34 Beside the income number, a better indicactor would be the source of income. If your primary income is from salary (aka your actual labor) rather than stocks, carry, returns, then you are probably middle class. Ironically salary is taxed at much higher rate than investments.
526 2019-05-16 18:54:30 A while back some old wise man named George kept telling me to buy Shopify stocks when they were $30 USD each. They are now at $278 and of course my dumbass didn’t listen.. #ragrets
527 2019-05-16 18:54:19 @novogratz we were all lied to when we were told diversification matters. Maybe it does. I dont think it does but then again. I'm not like anyone else. Stocks are dead. Inflation is coming. Buy Satoshis before all the bitcoins are gone. Draper isnt selling his. He's on vacation.
528 2019-05-16 18:53:26 Not trusting was emotion. But I followed  setups & price of stocks I am/was trading/stalking. Been in markets since early 90's & weathered (LTCM, asian contagion,  dotcom, housing collapse). The unevenness out of D.C today though is unsettling. Takes more effort to ignore.
529 2019-05-16 18:52:40 My dad says he wishes he had bought IBM stocks when they first went public. Will you be telling your kids that you wished you bought bitcoin when it went public? Or will you buy it now? #bitcoin #cryptotwitter #cryptocurrencies #blockchain
530 2019-05-16 18:52:36 Ornelas is not responding with a big season, so the timeline might be a little slow on his part. Not losing faith, but players are like stocks, and the stock is stable, not growing.
531 2019-05-16 18:51:37 I need to invest in stocks or something. I don’t want a loan when I purchase my home. The thought of a six figure loan scares me.

534 2019-05-16 18:47:47 Hi Lisa, I'm afraid all our products in stores are subject to availability, especially when on promotions as they can fly off the shelves! I’m afraid I don’t have the authority or ability to get any specific products stocks in stores. 1/3

536 2019-05-16 18:45:34 Caaaareful, the market is strong (at least in the US) Which means stocks will crash soon
537 2019-05-16 18:45:08 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
538 2019-05-16 18:44:50 So a shout-out to MAGA fans. Trump, after that 1.5 hr. talk with his pal, Putin, started trade wars destroying world markets/economy, plus posturing wars w/various states that will build up the armaments and gold stocks. These 1%ers are set to shoplift the world for themselves.
539 2019-05-16 18:44:21 Unfortunately the loon in the Assembly and Senate have decided that they will produce legislation to remove fossil fuel stocks from the fund. The fund is the best in the country and belongs to the retirees and employees of NY State, not the politicians
540 2019-05-16 18:44:18 Is this a zero-sum game meaning the managers will have to sell other stocks in order to buy Chinese stocks to reach the new balance?  Time to have indices including stocks from only TRUE free and transparent markets.

544 2019-05-16 18:41:56 $RMSL This is not an unknown stock, lots of loading for news and with the LOW FLOAT it's going to be a HUGE runner.. Don't be scared lol.. just saying..

545 2019-05-16 18:40:35 $XBI $IBB most bio stocks are not acting well. Despite $SPY & indexes bouncing, buyers showing little urgency. Technicals still negative. 
Is it just me, or is this not feeling much like a bull market at all? 
If no improvement by mid-next week, I'll reduce trading positions.
546 2019-05-16 18:39:43 Never buy penny stocks.

549 2019-05-16 18:38:58 Simply summer pullback, not just Meta single handed. Check out all the names and the volume associated, you will notice the volume/liquidity drying up.  Not many buyers looking to enter the pot sector heading into the summer. Historically summer has been bad for  pot stocks.
550 2019-05-16 18:38:22 Hiya, thanks for getting in touch the promotion was advertised as being exclusive to RealD 3D performances while stocks lasted. Could you drop us a DM with your booking reference?

552 2019-05-16 18:36:37 Did you know fish stocks will collapse around 2050 if something isn’t done to stop overfishing.
553 2019-05-16 18:36:23 Nothing makes you feel more like an adult than having a meeting with a financial advisor about your stocks and bonds that you didnt even know existed 
554 2019-05-16 18:36:21 Would have looked great on a charity gig I'm doing next week. Who stocks these in UK?
555 2019-05-16 18:35:59 Thanks. And, like with oil stocks signaling move in oil and gold miners signaling the move in the metal before it moves the insurers generally move in the direction.  Also a good reality check to see if the move in rates is legit
556 2019-05-16 18:35:34 Actually WE, the tax payers bail out the stock market; thru Gov, or Fed intervention if necessary.  Since top 20% own stocks, AND own Gov., its rigged.
557 2019-05-16 18:35:16 j’ai trop pleuré j’ai plus de larmes en stocks pour toute la tristesse qu’il me reste.
558 2019-05-16 18:34:38 Much of business does what they do for shareholders. What if companies were required to share stocks as part of employees employment? That would give them a voice in companies and not all control would be at the top.
559 2019-05-16 18:34:23 'Nigerian stocks have had a torrid time of late -- they’re down 9.5% this year. That’s the fourth-worst performance globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.' Very sad
560 2019-05-16 18:34:12 Bolton is the key .  Get the war in Iran and we got 150 oil coming. Stocks and real estate about to take off. 20 year post QE cycle. Let the fun begin
561 2019-05-16 18:33:59 I adjust as far as I can confidently do so, knowing that forecasts can change. As such, my changes are conservative. I am currently at 89.8 mln acres of corn with a yield of 174 bpa. That drops ending stocks to 1.746 bln bu w/ mkt yr avg cash price $4.05 per bu. Chgs daily #oatt
562 2019-05-16 18:33:58 Only own silver ETF at the moment... will look to add in summer if seasonality repeats per usual and silver stocks find a bottom... more interested in trades at this stage than massive accumulation.

Would need to see capitulation like 15-16 to really bet big.

Best of luck!
563 2019-05-16 18:32:45 1/2 US stocks remain best-in-class, whether you are looking at the last decade or just YTD. Yes, we know valuations are cheaper elsewhere, but they have been for that same decade and it has not helped...

567 2019-05-16 18:30:32 Midcap stocks are 1/3 or 1/4th since sebi announcement and ltcg!! How you plan to save inv money sir @arunjaitley
568 2019-05-16 18:30:17 That short order was placed on a downtick. When in SSR stocks can only be shorter on a bid uptick. Hope this helps.
569 2019-05-16 18:30:07 The stocks are rising but they are bearing bonds. Reaaly go public. Startup?  Haste.
570 2019-05-16 18:30:06 The more competition in the health market, the better. @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Americans can decide if the plan is junk or not. Right now, plans under ACA are JUNK and Costly! How many of you have stocks and bonds in the health market? Follow the money I say.
571 2019-05-16 18:28:59 I've traded it for several years. Look at how most stocks start their accelerated run.  Like you, I' usually avoid breakout / pivots, but since the crowd is typically afraid of big earnigns gaps, it still works well, and I'll buy that pivot.
572 2019-05-16 18:28:46 @NIFTY top can be seen at 11550 on 23 May. #Downturn after election results. #Modi will not have absolute majority

574 2019-05-16 18:28:20 There is a lot of pumping and bashing on FINTWIT,I feel sorry for the new investors that follow a lot of the stuff mentioned on here. My advice is never fall in love with any stock or any position...fundamentals tell you what stocks to buy, technicals tell you when to buy...learn
575 2019-05-16 18:27:59 August?!
576 2019-05-16 18:27:06 Always nervous when stocks are bought up right before earnings. Hoping they beat on  MAUs as it seems that what most are focusing on.

581 2019-05-16 18:24:59 If Trump really wanted to get economy going -- Give TAX break to working & middle class.  They will spend it into econonmy.  Rich invest in asset inflation (stocks, rentals, bonds) does not help real economy.
582 2019-05-16 18:24:57 why is it any of your business? Don’t buy the stocks if you don’t like how the companies are run.

Sauf que la faim ramena… la peste.

594 2019-05-16 18:20:13 60% of the GOP tax cuts went into stock by backs. Raising the value of the stocks without actually raising the value of the companies. Also that increase raises our countries GDP.  Essentially, the US economy is now based on the logistical creation of wealth without industry.
595 2019-05-16 18:20:01 Still planning to make a post talking about the Tether fud 'sell off". If stocks are a game, the news that comes out is only an opponent taking advantage of a moment of weakness. The Strong BUY making a higher low is a whale getting a fine opportune price JUST b4 the increase.
596 2019-05-16 18:19:56 Stocks up out of the gate, up over 1% and trying to hold it. TREND REMAINS DOWN, FULL HEDGES ON.

598 2019-05-16 18:19:21 People do short stocks, legally, and there the illegal naked shorting. I do believe it still happens. Previous posts included the term naked shorting which caused some to basically defend it by stating it does not happen.

602 2019-05-16 18:15:44 I use it when traveling since it’s thin. Its great for 2D games requiring a dpad. Prefer the offset stocks of the pro controller for 3D games. The big issue r/l 1/2 are split on the same shoulder button which can make it hard to press the correct one.
603 2019-05-16 18:15:16 He’s cost us much more than money (but plenty of that too) and he’s trying to capitalise on it? Such is his lack of dignity, he makes the case for the return of the village stocks.

605 2019-05-16 18:14:35 Is that why paddock was using bump stocks? because the guns where “automatic” and he just needed them to be more automatic?

610 2019-05-16 18:12:39 Well, not really, Greg. But it is good that I have "finally" convinced you that bonds will rally as stocks sell off. :-) Check out oil now btw. See how it is pulling back as the market retraces a bit? Make sure you pay attention when I unleash the sexy VIXens. :-)
611 2019-05-16 18:12:00 Gold is an inverse to USD assets because the dollar strength is still driven by the US' large gold holdings, despite what people think. Foreigners don't only buy stocks b/c they see value in companies, but also b/c it's based in USD, which is backed by large gold holdings.
612 2019-05-16 18:11:16 Sold more stocks today and used proceeds to add to $SPXL @ 48.96 just above vwap.  Sold most $X , most $CVS, all $RES, $BCS, $CCJ.  I'm sure they'll all double immediately but this is a simplification process.  Also, watching stocks grind lower while $SPX climbs fucking sucks.

649 2019-05-16 17:56:39 It would be interesting to see who in Congress is tied in with these PBM’s, wouldn’t it? After the ACA passed, many in Congress benefitted financially from insurance investments & hospital stocks.
650 2019-05-16 17:55:54 Is able the names of the 60 people that died at a concert in Vegas? Is cane the name of the company that manufactures bump stocks? Aren’t guns used to kill, rape, and rob others?

656 2019-05-16 17:51:13 Always interesting to see a stocks reaction after an offering  

Bears always think it is a bad thing, Bulls always try to find the positive 

One of the reasons companies go public is to have access to capital.

I like when a company does one from position of strength
657 2019-05-16 17:51:07 We said:  #Options expire May 16-17 (index, stock option-expirations), and May 22 (VIX volatility bets). Traders will try to run prices of stocks to profit not on stocks but how puts, calls and other derivatives increase or decrease far more dramatically than underlying stocks.

685 2019-05-16 17:34:26 @AOC Another good move is to hand the ethics office a statement each month that says "I did not trade stocks."  Ethical leaders like you lead by example...no matter what the rules are.

692 2019-05-16 17:30:54 Explains the stock market roller coaster ride. Koch brothers get pissed, big sell off, market takes a nose dive, then it slowly climbs as they buy their stocks back. They lose a little, but to them, it’s worth it.

700 2019-05-16 17:28:20 Some say profit is profit. I say if you're selling stocks time and time again for a small profit i.e. 4.5% when the probability is saying it's most likely going to go say 20% higher, then there's something wrong.

775 2019-05-16 16:56:19 Don't get me wrong -- I love the action in growth stocks today, and take it as a sign that the leaders want to go higher over time. But most indexes are still below their 50-day lines, so it's not like it's a free-for-all quite yet.

785 2019-05-16 16:54:01 Despite the negative tone of the market and the
belief of most analysts, institutionals where “this may not be another dip buy”. The reversal from the
route may find the short covering into FAANG Stocks (momentum stocks for much of the bull market)
may be well alive.
786 2019-05-16 16:53:53 Live testing in market n monitor at least 4 specially selected stocks and tweeking it week by week. It took 8 good months but finally its good. 2R is easily achievable now and coded in afl and works it own during market now.
787 2019-05-16 16:53:24 yeah! but leave some, and i always save that schmaltz (the yiddish word for chicken fat lol) to add to stocks that come out light, or tbh to cook potatoes in. nothing better than hash browns cooked in schmaltz
788 2019-05-16 16:52:31 Life is a right. In fact, unlike ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS which is not a right, life is specified directly in the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and remains the most fundamental right of all.
...fixed it for you Benny.
789 2019-05-16 16:52:12 I feel like you will be like Warren Buffet who did not invest in Amazon but continue to invest in Walmart because he does not understand technology.  Both stocks are great similar to how both gold and bitcoin are great.  But one definitely has much further room to grow.
790 2019-05-16 16:51:46 I don't see why expecting a great performance is unrealistic.
#1 anything can happen - stocks might soar tomorrow
#2 a positive outlook is imperative in investing
#3 just because you expect a certain outcome doesn't mean you put yourself in a position where you depend on it.
791 2019-05-16 16:51:03 Problem with afl backtetsing (sometimes) that it considers full candle. Backtesting is best when done of tick data and finding tickdata for NSE stocks and index is costly as well as tough job to maintain. Minimum we can get hands on from 3rd party 1 min data. So started doing 1/n

794 2019-05-16 16:49:56 $TSLA stocks would perform better if they didn’t issue convertibles, without convertibles hedging is very expensive for short sellers. But @elonmusk prefers convertibles because they don’t dilute existing ownership. Also Tesla doesn’t have good enough credit to issue bonds.

802 2019-05-16 16:47:23 You can try Morningstar. It's good for stocks, ETFs, funds and CEFs. Gives you most ratios and compares against a benchmark of your choosing. One major downside is that doesn't track individual bond performance. Also, I'm in the US not sure how it does in UK.

812 2019-05-16 16:44:28 The only people that benefit from this monetary policy are the owner of stocks and hard assets.  I guess the Fed isn't concerned with asset bubbles.  We've seen how this story ends before.
813 2019-05-16 16:44:23 It depends on the terms of the offering. Legally the hierarchy is Banks Loans > Secured Debt > Unsecured Debt > Stocks. Convertibles are unsecured debt so in case of bankruptcy/restructuring they may or may not get anything, if they do it’s after the banks n secured debt holders.

863 2019-05-16 16:23:08 I agree, hopefully there's not much more sanctions... I think the negativity is already priced in in Russian stocks and assets. Otherwise, the Russian Rouble should trade much higher given its correlation with oil prices

906 2019-05-16 16:02:17 No. Stocks do not have intrinsic value. Nothing does. Otherwise everybody would agree on what the specific value of a stock is.

Companies that turn losses year after year, like Tesla or Amazon are highly valued. Whereas excellently run businesses with profits are not.
907 2019-05-16 16:02:02 Makret been driven by corporate buybacks. So stocks like $EL, the company buys back stock driving up demand increasing price. Then individual officers sell at elevated prices. 

It'll all come crashing down but when? Sicking and criminal.
908 2019-05-16 16:01:24 Let’s invest in these stocks , let’s vacate on the yachts 
909 2019-05-16 16:01:24 well it would be very bearish for stocks

911 2019-05-16 16:00:22 XRP HODLers: Do not compare cryptocurrency to stocks on Wall Street, they are two entirely different things. Stocks are certificates to own pieces of companies controlled by CEO's and Directors. Cryptocurrency & XRP is a new money system altogether! We influence how it is used!

Too bad I used brokers for so many years who made money mostly for themselves. :(.  Harder to trade then
922 2019-05-16 15:53:24 Marc’s as honest as the day is long. He’s about 50-3 on stocks he’s tweeted about. (So far- could be 53-0 when the dust settles) The only stock you owned was a fraud perpetrated by your brother. @AlderLaneeggs
923 2019-05-16 15:52:17 When the total value of equities was roughly half of GDP like it was from the mid-'70s thru the mid-'90s; the economy was able to lead the stock market. But, when money printing pushes stocks to become 1.5x the value of the economy, it is stocks that then lead GDP.

926 2019-05-16 15:50:14 Start finding next Multibagger Stocks like HEG, Graphite India, Rain Industries. They risen many folds and now trading down almost 70-80% from their all time highs. So it's better to identify these kind of Stocks as bull market is just round the corner for Smallcaps & Midcaps.
927 2019-05-16 15:50:14 See what value teams have for Garland and Clover, Lonzo and Ingram's stocks have dropped a bit due to injuries. Skip the AD talks and don't get so focused on one player like years past and end up out of the free agents.

939 2019-05-16 15:45:47 Yeah and let’s bring back bear baiting. Public hangings and floggings and the stocks too. Which is essentially what that show is. No place for it in modern society

942 2019-05-16 15:45:16 I'll bet that stocks run up until the VIX hits 14.8.  Should be good for another 7 to 8 points.  All the bearish news is on the table so there's a chance we get a blowoff to ATH

946 2019-05-16 15:43:00 US already lost the econ war & that is apparent *because* stocks are 155% of GDP. US now trying to use state power to win the geopolitical war & reverse the damage caused during the econ war. Nationalism means national interests supersede short term econ needs. Invest accordingly

948 2019-05-16 15:41:42 $SPY It's no wonder that so many traders sell their stocks at times, ridiculously early! The moment it confirms a strong buy signal or breakout, everyone is out there to tell you it's at resistance. Stay focused.

953 2019-05-16 15:40:33 I don't need luck because I don't tell stocks that they are 'propped up' I simply follow them and if a 'propped up' stock makes me and my followers a lot of money then more power to us I suppose.
954 2019-05-16 15:40:21 Other than techland stocks, my alert for $APA and $COP went off. Both are reversals coming off oversold conditions and a play on oil. Both are attempting to bo above bases.

987 2019-05-16 15:28:14 Not sure maybe prior to 70's but would basically mean dow/gold ratio went sideways for extended period of time which we haven't seen.

992 2019-05-16 15:24:39 Buffett isn't investing in #stocks, like a couple thousand shares. He's looking to buy 25, 50, 75% of the company, where he can control the company.
993 2019-05-16 15:24:28 It’s not falsely inflating the stock price. The value of stocks is in part based on the supply of available stock and people willing to buy that stock. Supply and demand.
994 2019-05-16 15:23:55 I think you need some smaller #Oil stocks w/good growth prospects (6-12 month trading "pop" opp.?) and a sustainable divvy.  I still like $WCP.TO -- my fave.
995 2019-05-16 15:23:54 Trump made bump stocks illegal already, 95% of firearm deaths are with handguns, & military assault weapons are already illegal. Semi-auto rifles are not assault weapons. 

These positions would stop any Dem from winning the general election, & don't help you in the primaries.

1016 2019-05-16 15:13:26 Pumping and dumping stocks day by day has little to do with an overall economic trend. He happens to be toying with the two largest players in the game and as a result creating wild market volatility. This is not a good thing.

1018 2019-05-16 15:13:04 More likely, the more established BTC becomes (read: wide demand) the more the derivative markets for it will develop.

As everyone is jumping on the MTN train on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, you should keep an eye on valuable stocks that you've been eyeing for a while. With euphorias like this, it is a good time to hunt elsewhere

1160 2019-05-16 14:22:14 Yeah, in stocks you’re trading companies which are similar to living organisms, they have a lot that goes into it so a lot of news can affect them

Playing news is way more reliable in stocks. Also since there’s more participates TA seems to work cleaner than Crypto

1282 2019-05-16 13:39:57 Someone recently told me there's a "graveyard" of failed experiments in trying to inhibit #KRAS. This is frustrating because mutations in the KRAS gene have been tied to pancreatic cancer which is notoriously hard to treat. $AMGN $MRTX #stocks #investing #biotech

1347 2019-05-16 13:19:13 CEOs are not the investors or owners of a business or corp
They can be fired like any other employee
They have a higher income and are incented with bonuses, sometimes with stocks as other employees sometimes are

Even founding CEOs get fired

1354 2019-05-16 13:18:00 Stocks are share in a company that produces a profit. The price goes up and down in accordance to their profitability. For instance if your invested in ripple and they make a profit you make a profit. But when you buy xrp did you get a stake in anything?
1355 2019-05-16 13:17:49 Did you receive one? My thinking is that magic cards are actually two separate card stocks glued together using a special blue glue. The uncut foil sheets are probably only going to be the front side of the card. Without the backside and the glue, it would be impossible to cut.
1356 2019-05-16 13:17:39 and...I feel like a lot of stocks I post about go on to get whacked...so I developed a superstition...I'm not trying to protect it I'm already in!

4) You will get a shit ton of stupid spam.

1406 2019-05-16 12:58:17 On Wednesday Stocks surged due to the fact that President Donald Trump intends to delay the imposition of auto tariffs.

1407 2019-05-16 12:58:03 The idea of doing TA on an asset that has had multiple 100X returns over 9 years is astoundingly foolish.  No TA method is reliable to that degree. TA is for *stocks* that are generally flat (relative to bitcoin) for decades.
1408 2019-05-16 12:58:02 So you are saying the Fed will take us back to ZIRP land, and we should all buy stocks...?

Doubling the fees at Mar a Logo, manipulating tarriffs to help his donors, manipulating stock market to help day trade & short stocks, getting trademark deals with China for Trump business but nothing else.

1421 2019-05-16 12:52:08 Good morning everyone, we got two stocks on watch today that I am looking to go short on. 

First up is $CUI and then $MBIO with a possible move on $CLRB if we get back under 2.4-2.5, untill then it is still bullish and a possible long with the low float. 


1422 2019-05-16 12:52:02 @RobinhoodApp Suggestion: It would be great to have one graph for securities and one for only Cryptocurrency to track separately. Cumulative graph of both makes it difficult since crypto is way to volatile compared to majority secirity stocks.

1455 2019-05-16 12:36:55 Dear NY,
Please investigate which stocks the Trump family and friends invested in prior to his run for president. 
Words matter, and if he invested in steel, auto, or any company he has promoted during his term, it stinks of insider trading.
1456 2019-05-16 12:36:37 $ milkshake tastes so good. If people’s consensus is that rates go to 0 , then with low growth & fundamentals stretched what does low rates inherently do? Increase valuations (+ stocks & + bonds and then + $ when foreign investors realize this) @SantiagoAuFund

1462 2019-05-16 12:33:42 Someone should do a study on exactly which stocks the Trump family and friends invested in prior to his run for office.
Mega insider trading if he bought any stocks in the companies he's been tweeting or supporting. 
He knew if he did certain things the stock value would soar.
1463 2019-05-16 12:32:24 Diblasio is correct. I voted for Trump but never again. He promised not to be in bed w wall st.

1685 2019-05-16 10:12:00 What's best to day trade?

Logic = Volatility makes it easier to day trade

Bonds < Forex < Indices (ES < DOW < NQ) < Single Stocks

(just an approximation)

Yet, #traders (like me in the past) tend to fall in love with what doesn't move and stare into low-volatility markets.

Watch For Sharp Cut Of 200-Day Moving Average After A Big Run
1815 2019-05-16 08:09:34 Long-term moving averages, such as the 200-day moving average, are closely watched areas of support and resistance for stocks.

A move through a major moving average is often used as a sign from technical traders that a trend is reversing

1855 2019-05-16 07:40:31 rational behind this is that even if you have a decent portfolio of good stocks, once drawdown occurs you don't sell and sometimes u don't have steady inflow of money to avg it down and it takes long years to regain back the peak portfolio, these can be costly emotionally.
1856 2019-05-16 07:40:23 All of these stocks have come under severe pressure so comparing price performance for me is - eh. Also, not so sure Trump cares to consider Aus and Canada given previous actions and talk. He’s about 100% US energy independence - my bet is still on UUUU.

1968 2019-05-16 06:04:39 There are many stocks which have highly favourable fundamental ratios and look like a valuable investment. But if broader market doesn't stop the downside probable correction then these stocks also won't be spared.

1975 2019-05-16 05:59:05 This is so deliberately misleading its hard to know where to start - how about an honest listing of all stocks not fished in line with scientific advice around the UK? Or a list of the specific gear restrictions

2068 2019-05-16 04:50:29 Companies don’t buy stocks to juice the share price.  Companies buy back stock when they are sitting on cash and believe their stock is undervalued.  Corporations have a duty to increase shareholder value and stock buy backs are one way of doing that.

2077 2019-05-16 04:44:39 The main difference is that the buy back of stocks benefit the company and remaining shareholders if it's well done. A pyramid scheme benefits a particular person. As a CEO, the only benefit for you is being a good manager. Is commonly done at low stock prices, and it's legal.
2078 2019-05-16 04:44:37 In that case, let's buy stocks. I strongly suspect it's not what statisticians call a fair coin that we are flipping.

2093 2019-05-16 04:34:55 I don't think that high valuation consumption stocks will correct heavily; they can correct 10-15% accounting a temporary slowdown.

2142 2019-05-16 04:02:33 Markets buy scarcity. Does a prolonged period of low growth makes growth stocks relatively more attractive?

2258 2019-05-16 02:28:10 Some insightful words I read:

Guys under 40 were minimally invested in stocks last recession. They don't believe a stock market can drop 50% and they have a hard time believing that it won't coming roaring back. Takes a few recessions before investors lose their recency bias.

2278 2019-05-16 02:18:47 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs.

2369 2019-05-16 01:13:00 2nd Amendment also does not say "keep and bear semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks" either. The hypocrisy is ridiculous. Every one has their own interpretation, but separation of church and state has always been the interpretation of the Establishment Clause.

2376 2019-05-16 01:05:12 I mean, it’s a valid question. You certainly see similar situations with particular film stocks too. It’s a bit hard to explain with just words.
2377 2019-05-16 01:05:06 2 primary ways that excessive risk can force you to stop trading

2. A sudden price shock that wipes out the account

2390 2019-05-16 00:46:18 Well considering all my stocks show a value of $0.00, even with 100s of shares... Something certainly seems to be borked.
2391 2019-05-16 00:45:29 Literally stocks investors said EXO keeps SM afloat this is sick and twisted nahsjsbssjsbsb
2392 2019-05-16 00:44:53 I have don't currently own any internal stocks, bonds etc and I know from research that an IPO is  ot a good decision for me now, I am going to wait for the market to bring it down to earth.

2393 2019-05-16 00:44:25 I've already reduced my exposure to stocks because I think they're overvalued, so selling into a decline would be silly.
2394 2019-05-16 00:44:16 Trump notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks  and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative  concessions from the target co to make him go away. It was a form of  stock manipulation with an unsavory label: “greenmailing”
2395 2019-05-16 00:43:36 How many of these men have stocks in Adotion Agencies?
2396 2019-05-16 00:43:30 "Birth control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks— 1/2

"Beyoncé performed for Uber in 2015. Instead of her $6M pay, she requested stocks. Today they are worth over $300M. 

Last year, she took half of the $8M Coachella offered  in exchange for rights to the show. This week, Netflix paid her $60M for it."

2400 2019-05-16 00:38:01 The @SEC_News @OfficeGovEthics @CREWcrew should be reviewing trading activities in stocks & commodities expected to be impacted by tariffs. China, HK, US & various stock exchanges. Not inconceivable that @POTUS his political appointees & friends received insider tips. @SDNYnews
2401 2019-05-16 00:37:17 #Trump brags the economy is better for people bc of the stock market.

The average Joe doesn't own stocks...and sometimes works 2 jobs.
2402 2019-05-16 00:35:56 Im so eager to learn about investing, stocks, and wall street
2403 2019-05-16 00:35:45 @Rowan_Stocks
2404 2019-05-16 00:35:39 The Investment company is suggesting that people buy SM stocks now because of EXO comeback and WayV pulling in the Chinese market.
2405 2019-05-16 00:34:47 Sold all my Twitter stocks today. It will collapse if Donald Trump left @Twitter
2406 2019-05-16 00:34:47 @Tommy18 your reasoning seems to be applicable to each and every one of the clinical stage biotech stocks on the street, buddy.
2407 2019-05-16 00:34:40  If ripping me off means my stocks, IRA & retirement funds up by averaging over 22% in just over 18 months. Then I say thank you. Please may I have another? Our economy is the strongest ever in the world. So please please give me more!!
2408 2019-05-16 00:34:01 Ay sayanggggg! Limited lang kasi stocks nila :(
2409 2019-05-16 00:31:25 Interesting... sounds awfully like the book "the acquirer's multiple" by Tobias Carlisle and "the little book that beats markets" by Joel greenblatt, I love deep value investing. #goodreads #Reading #investing #stocks #economics
2410 2019-05-16 00:31:00 @bombay_beach_dreams all stocks movements are fueled by speculation rather than fact buddy. Once it becomes a fact to everyone on the street, including us, it would have been reflected in the Mc already.
2411 2019-05-16 00:30:13 Got'cha! I still to what I know... stocks would love to learn options.
2412 2019-05-16 00:29:59 Other person: How dare you support Trump when he's taking bump stocks and making stupid tweets.

Me: You know you can like a person without agreeing with everything they say or do, right? Humans are complex, no one person is going to be perfect.
2413 2019-05-16 00:29:58 Now that I find hard to believe. 
You see, if someone as intelligent as yourself can believe Farage, then well, I have some stocks I need to get rid of (sell to you). 
2414 2019-05-16 00:29:40 TBH, he’s probably feeling smug - his stocks are doing well, brown people are under control, MAGA.  Funny thing tho, he spent 8 years ranting about how Obama & the Dems blew up the deficit.  Trump the great businessman was the solution.  Didn’t believe he was a fake billionaire!
2415 2019-05-16 00:29:40 I was up at 5am, scrolling through my stocks and saw a weed ETF at a great price.....then I fell asleep. Woke up at 8 and that shit was up 40% and too high for me to actually make money. Reason no. 576,832,100 why I wish we didn’t NEED sleep
2416 2019-05-16 00:28:53 #ASX 200 +11pts or +0.18% to 6295. $WBC is now wiping out 13pts from the index as it trades ex-div. $WBC, $ANZ, $NAB & $MQG have all gone ex-div this wk (shares in the 4 stocks are down avg of 4.9% this wk) #ausbiz
2417 2019-05-16 00:28:09 I always bought or sold stocks with the intention of eventually "cashing in" at some point.

I buy and earn in #bitcoin, not to "cash in", but to opt out. 

This ain't a stock.  It's a currency.  The best of currencies.

What's in your wallet?
2418 2019-05-16 00:28:09 $MEG's 1Q19 net income rose 16% (Php3.8bn). Revenue grew 15%, driven by residential (85% of total). This may be sustained sales momentum from Chinese buyers from MEG's POGO tenants.

2420 2019-05-16 00:26:10 Not true anyway.  Bees create a frontal wing vortex, like a tornado updraft, that make them fly.

2426 2019-05-16 00:22:27 Lol you brought up the stocks only helping those that have lots of them. And the average closing price is up almost 10 bucks since 2016. Make up your mind. Are they up or are they down? Do those who have lots of stocks still benefit? 
2427 2019-05-16 00:21:24 I recently discovered fuck water. (Thanks Maya).
Their slogan is “Fuckwater: when spit and courage aren’t enough.” 
I think I’m gonna buy stocks in fuckwater.
2428 2019-05-16 00:19:49 Your "surplus" came in an election year and all it cost Canadians was the sale of $2.2B in GM stocks (at a loss), raiding the contingency fund to the tune of $2B and clawing back money from wounded vets among others.

You basically sold the car to have pocket change for gas....
2429 2019-05-16 00:19:36 do you have his returns? how shitty can they be w/ the stocks he owns?
2430 2019-05-16 00:19:03 The stocks are actually down.
2431 2019-05-16 00:18:58 If I was @SpeakerPelosi I'd watch myself #Barr might be inclined to investigate her inside trading of @Visa stocks from 2011. #Tucker #TuckerCarlsonTonight
2432 2019-05-16 00:18:55 Take this GLITCHY App down from playstore. Anyone with how i can easily buy the stocks? @MTN180 @MTNNG
2433 2019-05-16 00:18:29 Aussie stocks are off to a slightly better start on Thursday. #ASX 200 +4pts or +0.06% to 6288. All sectors are improving, however Westpac $WBC is the main weight as it trades ex-dividend #ausbiz
2434 2019-05-16 00:18:16 $JFC's 1Q19 profit fell 15% (Php1.5bn). Operating income fell 10% due to Smashburger. Ex-Smashburger, it would have grown by 9.1%.

2435 2019-05-16 00:18:06 I’ve lived here all my life. I only work one job and get by fine as do most people. I didn’t mention stocks but those are up too! And If I’m pedaling it’s only forward and it’s onto a Trump 2020
2436 2019-05-16 00:17:58 Interesting Fact: All of the G-7 countries have experienced at least one period where stocks have lost 75% of their value.
2437 2019-05-16 00:17:43 Y'all birds who don't know anything about stocks please hush. You ain't Beyonce
2438 2019-05-16 00:16:16 The gag is that y'all thought men were the only ones trying to dictate/eliminate reproductive rights. Alllllll them smelly ass crusty Republican women don't give a fuck about other women. All they care about is their babies-r-us stocks
2439 2019-05-16 00:16:08 Tbh WHY ABS STOCKS DECLINED IF THOU IS BLOCKBUSTER WHY KNTARDS CLAIMED SIMPLY PRETTY KATHRYN  INFACT OTHER NON PINOY JUDGES LIZA WAS THE BET

LOL..LOL ..so TRUTH REVEALS
2440 2019-05-16 00:15:42 Usually both stocks and gold rally during inflarionary periods.  Take a look at Venezuela’s stock market lol.
2441 2019-05-16 00:14:05 Cohodes has to pretend its an “execution” story and not a “i fucked up and dont know shit about stocks and my hedge fund went tits up and my shorts all suck and i cant pick a long stock to save my life” story so that no one can blame him. 

Dont worry marc, we all blame u $ostk
2442 2019-05-16 00:13:31 This is so stereotypical. Doctors and Penny stocks...
2443 2019-05-16 00:12:11 Do you even live here? Needing three jobs to just get by is not living the dream. Who is getting raises? The stocks only matter to those that have a lot of stocks. But keep pedaling.
2444 2019-05-16 00:09:06 This is messed up. I can't believe it would.come to this. I'm in my early 60s and thinking I empty my back acct, sell my stocks and get out of here. No one is willing to fight. Nancy is too soft.
2445 2019-05-16 00:05:11 Get a grip old man. You fools love throwing the alarmists bs to scare people, that’s all uve got.Denying the undeniable just makes you a fool or youve got your retirement looked up in tanking oil and gas stocks. The problem  is even if 1 idiot listens to you that’s one too many.
2446 2019-05-16 00:04:56 Home grown products native to this country in all assets in all Fields internationally with Mexico we will buy stocks in food as well as tax the rich cuz I'm robbing the hood
2447 2019-05-16 00:03:40 What’s the difference between this and Robinhood offering free stocks if you refer a friend.  It’s 2019, millennials respond to these type of marketing.
2448 2019-05-16 00:03:11 That’s more or less my portfolio of Uranium stocks
2449 2019-05-16 00:01:06 This happens every new round of investors tbh. The new kids never have seen a recession and think stocks can only go up. When stocks go down, everything collapses because who would’ve thought that markets aren’t Magic Geese?!
Irrational Exuberance
