39 2018-04-10 21:47:14 Whenever #Zuckerberg refers to Facebook users as “our community,” remember what he really means is “our commodities.”

Facebook is a private company, not a social service.

You are the resource it mines for profit.
40 2018-04-10 21:44:28 They end up with dollars, they don't have to buy treasuries, and they have not bought treasuries.  They have bought commodities and real assets, and lots and lots of gold with those USD's.
41 2018-04-10 21:32:08 How sad that we have come to think that taking a life is a good choice. We are going backwards as a species, losing our humanity bit by bit. We are becoming commodities to be disposed of when no longer able to contribute. We no longer want to suffer, losing our compassion. Sad.
42 2018-04-10 21:31:26 Then, that CO2 could be processed into a number of useful commodities, including new "fossil" fuel and cement.  All that would be required would be solar power.

47 2018-04-10 21:14:26 Within Kazini protocol, production of Food, Energy, Water, Labor are the activities that are centered & production of commodities is done. 
We call these activities FEWL.
FreeWork is A shared agency rules based economic system driven by FEWL. Kazini is the technology.
48 2018-04-10 21:04:23 Paquito, qué lástima que opinas de cosas que no sabes. Conoces el gravísimo problema para una distribución más equitativa que representa el acaparamiento de commodities a nivel internacional?
49 2018-04-10 20:54:08 Politicians are nothing more than commodities. Bought and sold
50 2018-04-10 20:49:12 Commodities are exchanged according to their values* sorry. (What I originally said is valid but less clear)

53 2018-04-10 20:36:05 Tell me about energy production, commodities and how a shared agency economic model works.
54 2018-04-10 20:35:57 Part of the problem is that people recognize themselves in the commodities they consume. Automobiles and homes have become part of identities.
55 2018-04-10 20:31:17 5.Nigerian had never expect that during your time they will bought a bag of rice at the rate of 15,000 instead of 7,500 as it was sold before and I believe even if you will given 10times tenure the price of commodities will never come down.
56 2018-04-10 20:30:37 in latin america we have the statist-socialist crony capitalist government, who only invested in consumer aspects of the economy and a high tide of commodities which then waned (it may be coming back now)
57 2018-04-10 20:23:22 Many commodities crosses like $EURAUD, $GBPAUD $EURCAD have reached the Daily Target meaning commodities currencies will be supported.
58 2018-04-10 20:18:47 todo fue x el ciclo alto de los commodities, nada mas que eso.
59 2018-04-10 20:17:42 3.Every day we are reading it on newspaper that nigerian economy is OK, external reserve hit from this amount to this amount but still we have not seen any positive impact on that people are still suffering no jobs every day the price of commodities are increasing
60 2018-04-10 20:12:42 Easy bruh....Trade commodities, stock market, real estate, and trade options
61 2018-04-10 20:06:22 YES - key insight. because we're commodities, like animals are to so many, which means their rights are nulled and void.
62 2018-04-10 20:05:40 Ask me about energy production, commodities and how a shared agency economic model works.
63 2018-04-10 19:55:55 I don't concede their will be savings at all. I am sure that the farmgate price will be lower. With my experience in farm commodities I have no confidence at all that any reduction in price will be passed onto the consumer. The correlation between the 2 prices is near nil.
64 2018-04-10 19:55:12 International market arbitrage on commodities presents great opportunities.

66 2018-04-10 19:50:13 No, jesus fucking christ no, commodities ARE NOT HOW YOU BACK CURRENCIES. Commodity backed currencies are fly by night shitshows that are fucking impossible to manage, are subject to market whims to a goddamn HORRIFYING degree, and are subject to an idiotic amount of instability
67 2018-04-10 19:49:11 ...es geht bereits heute weit über das hinaus, was Retailer hier in Deutschland und Europa anbieten.
Vor allem bietet HEMA [Alibaba‘s Supermarktkette] #Omnichannel quasi on-the-fly auch für Frischwaren an - nicht nur für schwarze/weiße Ware Commodities [lagerfähig/standard] an 
68 2018-04-10 19:34:44 This will allow a hike in price of agricultural input in terms of weedicides and Agro chemicals thereby influence price of agric commodities and to some extent reduce the agricultural population and result in food shortage in a long term
69 2018-04-10 19:13:42 This Facebook line that 'we just want to help people connect' is fluffy bunny puke inducing nonsense....concept was and always has been to use people as commodities to generate advertising revenue
70 2018-04-10 19:11:06 Keep your circle small, spend time and energy on quality... Quality across the board... quality time, quality experiences, and quality people. Time is one of the most precious of commodities... value and treat it as such.

74 2018-04-10 19:02:10 Exactly! Comparing direct and indirect taxes is a bit inaccurate as India has a Progressive taxation system..thus richer u r more is Tax incidence.

Indirect taxes on most of the basic commodities (paid by all) comes under 5% slab of GST..or zero %

So ofc richer will expct more
75 2018-04-10 18:58:40 Most I read here are dollar bulls looking for a major low.  I see the opposite and see the dollar bear market -- that's what it is -- continuing.  Commodities will be goosed like no one's business with this trend.
76 2018-04-10 18:58:16 Staples and salt are 2 commodities in which I have NO IDEA how anyone makes any money. #economics #Commodities
77 2018-04-10 18:58:04 And guess what? Their formerly unique services and features are commodities now too. Their value prop as a result has been reduced to just the network effect
78 2018-04-10 18:56:33 Markets back to the norm. #USD selling off & #Gold getting a bid on $DXY weakness. No safe haven play for the dollar. #Commodities ripping. Bonds selling off. What we saw was a sample of things to come, so when they pull the plug, make sure you have your #Gold, bear market coming

80 2018-04-10 18:54:40 Current system is basically an artifact of US being this weird undeclared world empire; in a real multipolar world, international trade would need commodities that were settled in terms of the underlying eventually.

83 2018-04-10 18:41:08 Is natural but if they sign commerce trade with Argentina and the US they can grow up even better, specially in the market of services with the support of all the US brands and in the medical field. Is about 50 days in overseas navigation to put commodities in both countrys
84 2018-04-10 18:33:40 @seanhannity When Russia destroys some of our naval vessels, what will Trump do then?  We have lost way too many lives in combat and wars that was not ours to fight.  It is like our people are disposable commodities and pawns for other nations.
85 2018-04-10 18:33:14 Note that the Dow and the Russell 2000 are the top performers today given that trade worries have faded even more after Xi’s speech.
Complacency or rationality?

91 2018-04-10 18:15:10 Aumento de apetite por risco. Dólar voltando a cair no mundo, commodities subindo, aumento de expectativa de inflação nos EUA (PPI nos EUA vieram todos acima hj).

102 2018-04-10 17:36:26 The fact is when leakages r blocked, and borders are locked against commodities that serve us no good, without good economic blueprint, sure, poverty increases, especially when a large chunk of d masses live on corruption proceeds. Stealing, oil hunkering, smuggling, subsidy etc
103 2018-04-10 17:35:14 “Há uma intrínseca relação entre a produção de alimentos em grande escala e o modelo do agronegócio que se volta para os mercados internacionais de commodities agropecuárias”, revela o deputado Zé Nunes.
104 2018-04-10 17:31:01 No. Those (foodstuff) often come in small kg packs..  

Not major commodities export in containers.  Via shipping.
105 2018-04-10 17:27:56 That it's not a contradiction is the whole point. Economists are strongly committed to fitting all of social reality into the frame of commodities and markets and optimizing. Not so much to any substantive position.
106 2018-04-10 17:23:41 I’m gonna need y’all tops to stop acting like you’re discriminated and plentiful. Y’all are COMMODITIES
107 2018-04-10 17:13:41 Meanwhile commodities are seriously rallying, Brent us over $70, the bond yields have dipped, and precious metals have been fixed to basically offer no safety play outside of some inflation-losing fixed income or savings. Low volume today = bad news for end of day again.

112 2018-04-10 16:22:47 I wasn't even accounting for off-field stuff. That's just MORE reason why they likely regret what they did. But mostly they regret it because a star at a position that's fairly easy to fill is far less valuable than a shut down corner: One of the rarest commodities in football.

141 2018-04-10 14:57:43 It's a statement that just highlights their mentality! I may not be a hockey coach, but I know for certain that treating people like commodities in the work place is NOT an effective way to forge loyalty, commitment and productivity!!

154 2018-04-10 14:22:55 Market based solutions to the environment necessitate the assumption that commodities (land, labor, money) will find equilibrium price levels and be rationed accordingly.

164 2018-04-10 13:50:16 True, and the reason why gross profit margins are so hard to come by when selling commodities.  Best time for margin improvement is when inventory is high and prices then go up.

173 2018-04-10 13:11:19 The healthcare system itself, by design, is corrupt. Unlike commodities, if you can’t afford care, you get sick or die. Healthcare doesn’t belong in a for profit model. Single payer is the only truly equitable solution.

229 2018-04-10 07:45:23 Sex is not a form of labour, however the sexual service of using one’s physical capabilities in exchange for money is a commodity (whether you approve of it or not). Commodities are always the product of labour.

247 2018-04-10 06:48:47 Acho que o que ela quer falar é que a gente investe muito em commodities e não há um investimento maior em outros setores. Tanto que, na fala dela, ela fala de ventos favoráveis e falta de uma economia mais diversificada. Foi isso que eu entendi.
248 2018-04-10 06:42:06 the price of commodities is not just the cost of production plus,profit, but it also includes the cost of who we're.

256 2018-04-10 05:30:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
257 2018-04-10 05:20:22 You this is not enforceable in law. The women are not commodities like you mentioned and any agreement of this nature does not hold in law. In any case, I totally agreed they’re mad.

260 2018-04-10 05:07:42 Ja'Wuan James was excellent prior to the injury. With this running back draft class, trading one of the rarest commodities in the league currently (a good offensive lineman) for a veteran back would be a colossal mistake.

262 2018-04-10 04:51:56 Commodities investors say whatever they need to say to reduce risk and increase opportunity. The dire narratives about loss of investor confidence is 90% gaslighting to make regulators and lawmakers sweat. There's plenty of opportunity to place big long money in Western Canada.

282 2018-04-10 02:12:50 I think the coin market cap rankings are smoke and mirrors.  People want you to think that the economy can be ranked and filed. Jobs, professions, and commodities evaluated for their worth based on artificial substantialization of material wealth.
283 2018-04-10 02:07:58 A few? #metoo shows it's not just a few. The attitude that women (it is mostly men vs. women, not exclusively) are commodities is pervasive.

288 2018-04-10 01:49:07 La coyuntura de la economía fue basada en los commodities y se desplomó, generó crisis y llevó al elevo de impuestos. La economía de “infraestructura” 4G no aumentó la producción; Agro, industria en crisis. El modelo de económico que propone no genera alternativa.

299 2018-04-10 00:18:07 Prior to that breakdown, the economy orbited around the exchange of commodities of equal value.  Since that breakdown, somewhere around half (probably a bit over) of demand is pure, non-productive fiat.  And that ratio is worsening.  We live in a (badly) planned economy.
