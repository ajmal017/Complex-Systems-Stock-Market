38 2018-10-24 22:12:13 IF YOU WATCH-

oh, nevermind  but I'm seriously more interested in the broad market right now than I have been for almost two years. Big things coming. I'm trying to keep up on US and foreign equities, gold and other commodities and crypto. There's a shift coming.
39 2018-10-24 22:06:41 Couldn't agree more - short term solution to address the short term problem of crypto price fluctuation. Also, I'd like to see a stable coin pegged to a basket of commodities - oil included maybe? Recall Vinay Gupta on @bchaininsider discuss this at some point
40 2018-10-24 22:06:16 They should be rights for everyone + public services - not commodities that some can pay for + others not. In many western constitutions they are (in writing) but no longer in fact. That is where we must get back to: society must be socially positive.
41 2018-10-24 22:03:01 But none for the production of commodities... that system was developed by Europeans as early as 1450.  No one is denying the fact that slavery is an old institution.  However, you just cannot simply obfuscate historical specificity in the name of making a false argument.
42 2018-10-24 22:02:50 First U want fine education & healthcare 4 everyone & now U state that education & public health should not be commodities? I do not understand.
43 2018-10-24 21:57:46 In export it’s not only agricultural commodities that is needed in the abroad . The native materials is something over there . Same as other local made stuffs . Also it’s not very hard to get access to international market.  Nepc  put together free program to connect with buyers
44 2018-10-24 21:48:52 why wouldn't it just flee to metals and commodities, like always? what big player is going to take that risk with billions of dollars? 

the cost of bring wrong is going under

the cost of doing what every one else is doing is saying "see? that's just how these things work"
45 2018-10-24 21:42:56 Fuel price rise by even one rupee will lead to increased transportation cost which in turn will result into price rise of commodities. It affects everyone of us. This is a very common sense. But you will be able to understand only if you try to be rational and not worshipper.

55 2018-10-24 20:48:59 Thats what happens when people are only valued as commodities.  There should be an entity to regulate the cost similar to other countries.

57 2018-10-24 20:39:48 Brilliant. I noticed how much that one of the main commodities that is in short supply is “common sense”. It’s integral in our job but the young ‘uns coming into the job didn’t seem to have any. Clever as anything, no street smarts!

65 2018-10-24 20:15:00 The intuition is similar, the difference is that a single factor (DXY) overshadows other potential drivers. Global risk aversion, changes in US rates or PR, commodities, all could have an indirect impact on the dollar and therefore the EM crosses (that are quoted in USD terms).
66 2018-10-24 20:13:05 Alright, stockmarkets close.

Ridiculous day there.
 $NDX -4.6%. Since top: -12%
 $AMZN -6.0%: Since top: -18%

$BTC --> remaining stable. 
$ALTS popping everywhere. 

Still extremely bullish on crypto & commodities.

82 2018-10-24 18:59:42 We have a listening and caring President and Gvnt. The people said open the borders so that competition and alternative  choice of suppliers of basic commodities increase and prices stabilize.

83 2018-10-24 18:48:04 You are trying to compare healthcare to a car or house? Health is a right for all Americans. Commodities like cars and houses can be bought and sold.

84 2018-10-24 18:46:06 Many of this genre of coin involve multi assets, like multi fiat (50/50) or even including a basket of currencies and commodities (gold).

85 2018-10-24 18:45:48 If you're selling a commodity, then makes sense to put the price upfront. If it's a bespoke customized service, then private pricing works. Most of these things people say DM for price for are commodities.
86 2018-10-24 18:44:16 Look up 'zero hour contracts in game qa'. QA is increasingly outsourced, involves repetitive work - and are often treated like disposable commodities. If you contract in QA, job security is often nonexistent; and career jumping from QA to other gamedev is near impossible.

98 2018-10-24 18:02:22 Here's the GOP ' S trickle down baloney in action: trump messing with #NAFTA screwed up farm commodities exports.. farmers losing money. So federal government buys their stuff, like cheese, and sends it to the food banks.. where it "trickles down" to poor, hungry pple
99 2018-10-24 18:00:34 Isn't it also safe to conclude that move will improve availability of commodities, while also pushing up the prices. The cost of import will merely be pushed upon the consumer

101 2018-10-24 17:56:23 You'll have people that design, build, maintain, sell, install robots! That's the same thing they said about automobile automation. Human jobs didn't go away they increased.

110 2018-10-24 17:14:55 Problem is: after price increases from health and commodities most people will end up with less. Most people will not benefit from the stock market increases either. I guess you think  #Americans are stupid. Sad!
111 2018-10-24 17:11:47 seems like the situation is moving even more faster than 2008. prices for basic commodities are unreasonable. survival of the fittest.
112 2018-10-24 17:10:05 School over-simplifies the concept of investing, day trading, and portfolio management.

It’s misunderstood that day traders or investors only have the option of buying low and selling high.

It’s just that fame turns people into commodities & it denies people the opportunity to be complicated, flawed and whole like everyone else. People build pedestals to knock them down.

123 2018-10-24 16:19:00 In economics, commodities that cost a country more than the value of their markets are called ‘bads’ (opposed to ‘goods’). They include eg alcohol & cigarettes due to health system costs. But I think it’s time we included #weapons. Whatever their market value, wars cost much more

It is also important to pick the right moment to open your deals. Experienced traders enter the market when the volatility is the highest, which is usually in the very beginning of the trading session in case of stocks, indices, fonds and commodities.

152 2018-10-24 14:44:35 The proof of that seems to be absent. Farmers typically view animals as commodities, without regarding for a second that they are sentient, and feel love, affection, pain, suffering, fear & panic as they realise they are about to die, as U would in that situation. Empathy?

161 2018-10-24 14:29:46 The higher correlations are a shift from earlier this year when the link between U.S. stocks and other investments had essentially disappeared. Major equity benchmarks like the SP500 had surged ahead of global stocks and commodities.

193 2018-10-24 12:42:17 I agree. Panic buying in September 2017 did not result in shortage of commodities though prices went up after that. Also, the shortage of forex is really biting. With the clampdown on forex dealers a lot of retailers will suffer.

225 2018-10-24 10:12:53 The infinite accumulation of capital depends on turning the planet into commodities infinitely. The planet's resources are finite. Think about it.
226 2018-10-24 10:06:32 It really depends on what the object is--is it maximizing a stable balanced growth path, is it efficiently assigning relative prices to different commodities, is it maximizing utilities given scarcities, is it revealing certain information & preferences, and so on.
227 2018-10-24 10:05:10 Some assume fixed commodities, input/capital values, etc., some assign prices based on scarcity, some concoct a utility function that they optimize by some criteria, some allocate to sectors based on project growth paths etc.

232 2018-10-24 09:34:11 Thanks for reading the paper and the interesting question. Assumption 2 is a central tenet of the labour theory of value for commodities produced in the same country. In the short and medium term, the wage differences among professions do not vary much.
233 2018-10-24 09:25:33 Similarly, under ideal conditions (well specified incentives, information, and metrics, sufficiently finite well defined commodities, enforced rules, sufficiently low costs,sufficient exogeneity, etc), the formalisms of market and planning are the same.
234 2018-10-24 09:24:20 I mean, under simple commodity production, and in the absence of rents, with well defined basic commodities, marginalism & the labor theory of value actually produce the same results! (something Marx & Samuelson both acknowledged!)

244 2018-10-24 08:23:33 Government has amended indefinitely SI122 of 2017 to allow companies and individuals with offshore and free funds to import specified basic commodities that are in short supply. This is due to the spectaculative behaviour of local retailers and panic buying
245 2018-10-24 08:17:22 Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on which side of the line you are) beer was never on the list of basic  commodities regulated by SI 122.

247 2018-10-24 08:02:58 Sorry Haydn, I remember it differently. During most of Clark's reign economic times were great due to high demand for our commodities. In 2007-2008 Labour passed a tax cut as NZ went into recession. Clark/Cullen spent all spare cash to try to win the election. Then the GFC hit NZ
248 2018-10-24 08:02:38 Anyone other than BJP because it is a party with no expertise or guidance, the glimpses of which have been seen in the past 4 years. Lynchings, Unemployment, Failed promises, scams, sponsoring exile of defaulters, falling rupee, raising fuel prices and that of commodities..
249 2018-10-24 08:01:56 Inflation refers to price rise of important essential commodities like wheat, flour, milk, meat, medical services and other essential services of life etc. Inflation affects the whole social framework of society including economy of the country, and production. #PakistansEconomy

252 2018-10-24 07:39:57 Bond out cz people who import obviously they will charge in rands  their commodities ,so let's deal with rands in everything cz if I work and paid bond it doesn't work cz forex rate will reduce my purchasing power  so it's better to have my pay in rands
253 2018-10-24 07:39:44 Delusional rants China will start buying commodities in cny and all his CA deficit hence shortage of dollars theory will amount for sh1t; even though I think he is a smart guy he became part of the American sheeps that bahs about how America is stronger
254 2018-10-24 07:31:59 While the lifting of import ban on basic and other commodities by the government is plausible,it is going to trigger an increase in the demand for foreign currency which in my view will escalate the depreciation of the bond note in the parallel market.

267 2018-10-24 07:06:26 I completely agree that most commodities went up by x20. A Ford model T was 900$, a McDonald's cheeseburger was 20c in the 60s. 

But look at old ads for appliances, like a TV in the 50s for ~300$, a toaster for 20$, a fridge for 300$, and lets not talk about computers.

295 2018-10-24 05:32:44 Fuel should be part of the commodities on the Sl 22.If government allow private players to import fuel, it implies that fuel will flood the market and this would regulate the price hikes in Zim.Fuel is the basic commodity that determines the economic wellness of a country.
