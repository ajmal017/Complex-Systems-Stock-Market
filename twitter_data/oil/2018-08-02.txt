36 2018-08-02 23:56:43 Big oil asked for it
37 2018-08-02 23:56:42 OIL Companies can reach the 1 Trillion mark easily because of the product they sell. But for a Technology company to reach that milestone is not easy. Every human on this planet consumes oil but 98 % of them don't own or can afford an iPhone.

42 2018-08-02 23:56:14 He says Scotland's offshore revenue to the UK was £469.777 billion in the year. That's the price (i.e. not revenue) of around 10 billion barrels if oil. Peak oil in 1999 was only 398 million barrels!! If he can't see he's talking absolute crap then his brain is the size of a pea.

48 2018-08-02 23:55:16 If IRAN shuts in Hormuz with gun boats. Oil will go to $100. At $100, the Low Sulphur Diesel will skyrocket the 2020 futures. Marine Fuel will soar and Africa will need to adjust its imports.

62 2018-08-02 23:53:45 I mean i live in a Oil town, a 1 bedroom apartment almost 2k a month, but the price of food and stuff doesn’t change dramatically from when i lives in Killeen, which is about 600-700 for an apartment, only thing that really changes is Milk and eggs etc etc
63 2018-08-02 23:53:44 have u tried putting castor oil on ur lashes at night?
64 2018-08-02 23:53:43 i had never used a biore strip before and i gotta tell you: i'm a different person now. the old ryan? dead. this one watched long stalactites of oil and dirt yanked out of their dumb nose and now i just gotta live with that i guess
65 2018-08-02 23:53:31 Which is NOT what the country wants - except the oil industry.
66 2018-08-02 23:53:25 Got a car wash and oil change now I feel better 
67 2018-08-02 23:53:19 I cut my hair roughly 2 months ago. (In 10 days I make 2months) 
And like I said, I’ve been taking care of it. I put castor oil on my edges, I keep it moisturized and protected and I’ve honestly been doing good. I keep my hair braided and I redo them every 4 days or so.

70 2018-08-02 23:52:51 a grubhub type company but just for french baguettes with optional herbed up olive oil for dipping on the side
71 2018-08-02 23:52:50 confirmed oil spill
72 2018-08-02 23:52:47 For a guy that takes such great care of his body and burns the midnight oil to get that extra edge over the competition, you just hate to see that
73 2018-08-02 23:52:39 Very nice porn, lately really made a lot of oil and seduction. I like the fact that she does a season, for people the heating what would that so every few months under a fetish can be a motto Voda only so things are produced would be a question to you would be happy if her answer
74 2018-08-02 23:52:38 A real plan for sustainable growth, supporting future jobs in solar, wind, EVs and batteries would be wonderful. Instead we have pipelines, continued oil subsidies, no EV  incentive, no real plan. I realize it is hard but your govt spends a lot of money.
75 2018-08-02 23:52:30 Guess who owns a large % if the railroads that transport the oil, Trudeau met them last year with photos. Bill Gates and Earen Buffet.
76 2018-08-02 23:52:29 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
77 2018-08-02 23:52:15 Fish oil biiiiitch!
78 2018-08-02 23:52:13 But Norway ironically still makes most of its money in its economy from oil and in fact were part of the banking infrastructure involved in funding the DAPL  #tytlive 

which sucks, but yes, at least they are committed to no carbon cars by 2030
79 2018-08-02 23:52:10 #FLDemDebate Graham voted FOR the Keystone Pipeline which leaked gallons upon gallons of oil. A Democrat that voted for the pipeline, yet calls herself an environmentalist. A joke. #GillumForGovernor
80 2018-08-02 23:51:53 Know feeling! It's filtered down in2 private sector. I went 2 pharmacist & asked for oil of cloves 4 sore tooth & you'd have thought I'd asked for attar of sylphium. Blank look! Found name of compound'd been changed 2 eugenol. Probably thought it would sell better than clove oil.
81 2018-08-02 23:51:53 He was growing dinner, beans and rice. Tough generation.
82 2018-08-02 23:51:50 Just gonna pop in here and say tea tree essential oil is wonderful if used & diluted carefully but can be dangerous if used without proper research/ratios 
83 2018-08-02 23:51:43 @4fishgreenberg:
“Every one of these reduction fisheries, these companies that reduce fish to dust and oil, will say they’re managing it in a sustainable way, but when you add up all the fish, it’s still 25 million metric tons, the human weight of the US..
84 2018-08-02 23:51:41 Throwing shade @ the essential oil trend on Twitter is my love language
85 2018-08-02 23:51:41 that's what i did but I put a pan of oil on the heat for it to warm up for fries and it was smoking so much if I left it on for like a minute longer it wouldve burned down the whole apartment complex yeehaw
86 2018-08-02 23:51:37 @realDonaldTrump "make cars great again"?  go away .. you're killing us / either you're lying about the EPA / now the chg'g oil standards by the kochbros - fossil fuel corp .. go away .. fast ... now

89 2018-08-02 23:50:17 #tytlive Given that oil is a finite resource, it seems to be to the oil industry's advantage to extend the life of their companies by applauding higher mileage cars...
90 2018-08-02 23:50:16 Russia has one commodity. Oil.  They have the 30th largest economy in the world. NY and Cal are bigger. They are a regional power.

If oil prices go up, so does the Russia economy. US sanctions on Russia after Crimea crippled the country....conveniently relaxed under Trump.
91 2018-08-02 23:50:13 also, people complain about CEO's getting massive salaries, people then complain when they dont get massive salaries, can't win until every cent is given away. at least he's trying to do something good for the world unlike some companies like ISPs or oil companies.
92 2018-08-02 23:50:05 What actions like lowering the standards for the endangered species act and giving in to the big oil and gas companies that will ruin the environment
93 2018-08-02 23:49:41 una ANC no tiene facultades sino para redactar una constitucion y consultar al pueblo para su aprobacion. de donde salen las facultades para dictar decretos y mas aun en materia economica.?

97 2018-08-02 23:49:12 Have you tried monq or a personal essential oil diffuser?
98 2018-08-02 23:48:58 Sometimes oil and vinegar just won’t do
99 2018-08-02 23:48:50 In Finland it's around $8., you have to realize we produce gas, as well refine it. Also oil producing countries can't flood markets with oil either, prices will fluctuate. Prices are high there too, because they don't want you to drive.
100 2018-08-02 23:48:37 Apparently, Gwen Graham voted for the Keystone pipeline because they were pulling the oil out of the tar sands anyway, so she had no choice.  Hm.
101 2018-08-02 23:48:26 I present to you a snake oil salesmen fleecing scared stupid people.
102 2018-08-02 23:48:24 As a scientist I am fed up with what I see daily on TV news when it comes to issues such as GHG policy, extreme events under climate change, oil sands development, First Nations rights, and more. The spin from all directions is unprecedented.

Time to enter politics and fix this?
103 2018-08-02 23:48:19 My white grand dad was a fisherman on the Gulf of Mexico. He and his family lived in tents and pole-and-palmetto huts in mosquito-infested Middle Florida. So many advantages because he was white...
104 2018-08-02 23:48:11 @ERM8Federico  they think it’s oil 
105 2018-08-02 23:48:08 That would seem to be the required next step

Hodeida Port and/or Socotra Island to control crucial waterways of the oil tankers &vessel traffic onRedSea
111 2018-08-02 23:47:50 Government subsidies of Big Oil in the US.
112 2018-08-02 23:47:46 And Bush/Cheney fell for it because they actually thought they could conquer the Mideast and get cheap oil. I actually think it was mostly Cheney with Bush snookered into cooperating. When they intentionally let bin Laden escape Tora Bora they showed their hand.
113 2018-08-02 23:47:42 It may take $19 million to drill OPL 226.
It could be flowing some 6,000 to 10,000 barrels of oil per day by this time next year.

It was estimated that a well could cost around US$30 to $50 million to tie in production on the backend. This money has been found via: term sheet.
114 2018-08-02 23:47:37 Ana fails to make the connection that oil companies are consistently pushing for cars to be less efficient because they want to sell MORE oil based product. High fuel efficiency cuts into Oil profit. #TYTLive
115 2018-08-02 23:47:25 cos it's the biggest battleground stock in the world right now. 
it's the craziest cult stock (up there w/crypto crazy )

& narrative has always been curated carefully. longs vs shorts. green vs oil
116 2018-08-02 23:47:21 Here's where the unexpected BOOST happened

Just as I was making it up my walkway, I entered the gates of my development this time like most times, with "thanksgiving & praise" -

Except this time I marveled about his wisdom - I praised him, I got just enough, no oil spoiled, and
117 2018-08-02 23:47:07 Update: honestly I’ve been going through a lot and I just want to say the only thing keeping me going is all of my fans out there and my daily dose of olive oil.
118 2018-08-02 23:47:02 Fucking snake oil salesman con man. He should never have been sworn in. He is illegitimate. And everything he says & does proves it.
119 2018-08-02 23:47:01 And thousands and thousands sent to the oil companies.

143 2018-08-02 23:43:34 Where do they end up? Crush for oil, bird seed or human consumption??
144 2018-08-02 23:43:32 Spinach & blue cheese pizza 
P.S: This is a vegetarian meal!
- preheat oven to 200/180°C & place baking sheet inside.
- Heat some oil in a frying pan and cook about 2 chopped mushrooms along with some garlic.
- Add handfuls of spinach at a time and cook.
145 2018-08-02 23:43:23 CNRL has made pretty significant investments in buying up sell offs in the oil sands. Are domestic investments not as good as foreign ones?
146 2018-08-02 23:43:16 Keep oil in your lamp.
147 2018-08-02 23:42:34 My local Chinese does a tofu curry which is vegan, the chips are fried separate to everything in veg oil nd I just get plain boiled rice so it's really good

160 2018-08-02 23:40:18 @realDonaldTrump I have been an oil and gas broker for a while, I get guys to send me hundreds of thousands of dollars over the phone. Not many better then me. But holy shit mr president, you are on a whole different level. Long live trump.
161 2018-08-02 23:40:17 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
162 2018-08-02 23:39:56 "Snake oil HERE, get your snake oil!!"
163 2018-08-02 23:39:46 "It is simply a bucket of oil."

A tiny understatement. 
One mans bucket of goo is another mans survival.  
TY for the follow, reciprocated in kind. 
164 2018-08-02 23:39:42 Not yet, but it may soon be. :D
165 2018-08-02 23:39:41 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
166 2018-08-02 23:39:38 That's good news. Oil companies will never stop fracking in the United States. That we can count on unless they are legally forced to stop.
167 2018-08-02 23:39:32 And I'm still shocked by the amount of olive oil they use compared to us *hint:much much less*
168 2018-08-02 23:39:29 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
169 2018-08-02 23:39:08 And oil prices . It also mentions that in under scores the governments efforts to attract foreign investment
170 2018-08-02 23:38:58 Why am I suddenly wanting roasted yam with fried palm oil stew.... owo ti awon iya gbe wa ni Irole yi o derun
171 2018-08-02 23:38:55 This is what I don't get, I mean I'm no oil painting, but Trump is so physically repulsive and his voice is so weedy. He's disgusting.
172 2018-08-02 23:38:54 Is the entire Ninth circuit now required to become 'Shall issue' states?
173 2018-08-02 23:38:48 Yeah...because oil and coal are in infinite supply!
174 2018-08-02 23:38:46 How often do you oil the crank on those blinders because it kind of sounds like they're pretty long. YOU have bought n2 this bullshit that is constantly repeated everyday without question, it appears. Russia, Russians, Putin etc., r very much apart of ur leader's administration.
175 2018-08-02 23:38:26 Git that money, girl. Alaska's going to need it thanks to manmade global warming. Yet you were all giddy to sign over public land to big oil. What gives, Senator from Exxon Mobil? Either you're for preserving public lands or against. I'm confused. 
176 2018-08-02 23:38:18 Yes, when farmers, cattlemen, gas & oil, big pharma & other corps get welfare it's called "Subsidies". The subsidies that are given out to the non-poor total WAY more than the AFDC programs. So why does our country vilify the poor & not the filfy rich sponging off of taxpayers?
177 2018-08-02 23:38:18 Olive oil itu mah kak
178 2018-08-02 23:37:57 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil/Gas at tidewater displaces dictator from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Gay friendly oil = killing #LGBTQ @vancouverpride @VictoriaPride @uvicpride @gayvancouver
179 2018-08-02 23:37:32 Mike--- what kind of beard oil do you use and where do you get it... Thanks
180 2018-08-02 23:37:32 I'm all for them eating lots of salt, oil and sugar and dying gradually and early, hopefully from a painful and debilitating stroke. I'm not bitter.

187 2018-08-02 23:37:03 Today i was in OP and we were talking bout food and I asked a girl who she prepares Pasta but she said "okay you boil the water and bla bla bla, then when it is ready you add some oil, but if you are tierruo you add butter"... I can not be friend of that girl
188 2018-08-02 23:37:02 I came in the nail shop as ashy and as out of pocket as I could. Would it be wrong of my to ask for some oil for my feet?
189 2018-08-02 23:37:00 Carter = no war, worker protections, push for less fossil fuel & more renewables, which is why Big Oil still undermines his legacy w/bs that he was weak. He was far more qualified than any Republican who became POTUS after him.
190 2018-08-02 23:36:59 Quick oil change and off to Salem. Bags packed.
191 2018-08-02 23:36:41 It’s Milikovsky not Netenyahu. He’s a Polish kid trying to take over an oil rich region.
192 2018-08-02 23:36:36 Macam mantap kerja dkt oil and gas huhuhu.. Tp lama beb bape bulan sekali nak balik..
193 2018-08-02 23:36:31 I’ll dm you oil
194 2018-08-02 23:36:30 Please do some research on oil consumption.  The planet only Has enough sweet oil to last 50 more years.  After it runs out the only oil left will be so expensive no one will be able to afford to burn it. (Supply demand). The market will adapt green.
195 2018-08-02 23:36:24 The Kingdoms of Benin and Songhay had palm oil powered street lamps 100 years before London.
196 2018-08-02 23:36:14 seriously, I wasn’t lying in that song
do you have any idea how much olive oil I use on a daily basis?
crazy
197 2018-08-02 23:36:14 Hi base would swallow motor oil if he told them too, that is the danger, he is like a modern Jim Jones
198 2018-08-02 23:35:57 the democratically elected government, as they have done throughout central and South America. This combined with the drop in oil prices and the country’s over dependence on oil and savage sanctions have led to their economic problems.

200 2018-08-02 23:35:42 Trump seems to think he has a power of mass hypnosis over the entire country. Telling us he cares about clean air after giving coal and oil industry a break, then tearing up EPA regulations. But now we have the cleanest air ever.
201 2018-08-02 23:35:37 what you will need: 
-1 cup baking soda
-1/2 cup citric acid
-1/2 cup Epsom salts
-1 tsp. water

-3 tsp. oil (olive oil)
-food coloring (any color)

205 2018-08-02 23:35:08 And what was oil before, &yes, you have storages, and this & that, but, in order to get to storage facilities, you, Boeing suppose to have the ways (roads), and if it’s covered with water, you won’t fly there. Cause you can’t.

211 2018-08-02 23:34:34 @senorrinhatch U DO NOT REPRESENT ME. U sold ur soul, & Utah's lands, to oil & coal co's for power & greed. U will not be remembered kindly by the majority of UT & the country. Shame on u supporting a narcissistic liar, cheater, sexual abuser. What happened to your moral compass?
212 2018-08-02 23:34:32 I was full on vegan - whole food plant based no oil - for 5 years and the gas never stopped! Now that I’m carnivore - 1.5 years - instant relief!
213 2018-08-02 23:34:26 คิดถึงคุณจัง //อยากกอดจริงๆ
214 2018-08-02 23:34:25 It is some hemp extract, that is why it looks so "dirty". I think this was made with alcohol as a solvent, but I am not sure if I remember that correctly. It is simply a bucket of oil.
215 2018-08-02 23:34:20 My least favorite thing is mixing a new jar of peanut butter. Stupid oil!
216 2018-08-02 23:34:15 Iran closes gulf

Trump followed orders
217 2018-08-02 23:34:14 Families had to sneak out the back entrance of their house of worship.

They physically attacked pastors who were singing hymns at the time.

They surrounded a group of UVA students, including a teenaged girl in a wheelchair, and threw oil on them then tried to light them on fire

223 2018-08-02 23:34:01 Both Bernie and @jeremycorbyn  keep saying there should be no poverty because their countries are the richest. But both also seem to be opposing the reasons why these countries are rich ( stealing oil, selling weapons..etc) I wonder how they’d keep their countries as rich.
224 2018-08-02 23:34:01 That is too narrow a view. Keeping the complex Israeli-Palestine issue aside - fact is Israel has innovated, it converted a desert into a productive land; has one of the best startup eco-systems; their Arab neighbors with so much oil wealth produce zero innovation.
225 2018-08-02 23:33:50 Ok but to be honest, a bag if spinach turns to nothing when you saute it in some oil
226 2018-08-02 23:33:12 Tea tree oil is all fun and games til it gets in your eye
227 2018-08-02 23:33:12 I could ask my dad anything and his answer will always be “check the oil in it”

230 2018-08-02 23:32:30 Boeing, with all my respect, I do understand absolutely everything. I just hope that U, cause U R Boeing do understand everything well too, cause U R Boeing.
But reality is as it was in Texas, after really heavy flood oil wells are turning into wells with something in between H2O
231 2018-08-02 23:32:25 Yt folks use to kill black people and make oil from their skin and y’all saying this generation lacks empathy. Lol yt folks were once all serial killers.
232 2018-08-02 23:32:03 Rosenstein recommended the firing so he could appoint Bush-camp Never Trumper to do Putin's Russia's bidding by sowing discord to slow Pres Trump down, but Pres Trump still crushing Russian economy by becoming #1 oil producer, and expansion by arming Ukraine.  Awesome!
233 2018-08-02 23:31:38 Richie, remind me to tell you sometime about an old model 600 that was "leaking oil."
234 2018-08-02 23:31:35 i also use a foam cleanser (soon jung 6.5 whip cleanser) as to me atleast, it helps clean those pores, i also tone with a sensitive skin toner (right now i’m using the acwell liquorice toner) and finish with a moisturising lotion and an oil
235 2018-08-02 23:31:29 Yes, let's stop subsidizing environment-destroying fossil fuels, and use that money to support green energy sources.  The oil industry will just have to realize it's on its last legs & get with the program.

237 2018-08-02 23:31:03 After GW invaded Iraq I swore off the GOP.  That war was prosecuted for Oil and Ego.  I knew a lot of guys that fought, died or came home changed forever.

239 2018-08-02 23:31:00 Venezuela made the mistake of allowing the oil industry to dominate the economy to the detriment of literally every other sector going back 60 years. Meanwhile, most of Europe does as Bernie says and they are doing fine
240 2018-08-02 23:30:56 Alaskans own 36,789 shares of TRILOGY ENERGY CORP, worth $134,340. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
241 2018-08-02 23:30:55 Is it true black seed oil cures everything plus aids ??? But it can’t cure death @ShadyFansite
242 2018-08-02 23:30:52 The texture looks like an oil painting. If that’s watercolor, that’s truly impressive.
243 2018-08-02 23:30:49 With all the preservatives in jelly you don’t have to, they recommend it bc it slows down the separation of the oil but it’s honestly just preference.
244 2018-08-02 23:30:47 I remember when Tinubu was campaigning in surulere and he was distributing rice and oil. He also had a very popular Fuji artiste at that time do a campaign mixtape for him.
245 2018-08-02 23:30:41 Your Grand Inquisitor demanded his auto-da-fé, and the courageous "heretic," knowing the oil would be lit no matter what she said, refused to give it to him. 

Good for her. 

The days when we are going to grovel for the approval of our enemies are over. Screw all of you.

253 2018-08-02 23:30:00 So when I look at Manitoba’s economy in 2016, you said that was unfair because of oil downturn. But Alberta is fair game? Interesting. 

Also, what page shows the GDP or actual economic indicators?
254 2018-08-02 23:29:41 wait what am I saying it says oil on canvas in the title

259 2018-08-02 23:29:05 @NewsHour #MaryKateHopkins lies telling outright lies about the economic impact of driving fuel efficient cars @marykatehopkins this is a terrible lie #Hopkins is an advocate for oil companies & shame on #JudyWoodruff for not challenging Hopkins’ lies !!!

260 2018-08-02 23:28:25 You can't argue facts and logic to a cult member whose leader is saying strait up not the believe what they see or hear. It's crazy how so many people will still buy snake oil in 2018.
261 2018-08-02 23:28:17 @heritagegmcbuick wow, talk about disappointed! Dropped the truck of last night for warranty work, it's currently 18:26 and we are still waiting for an oil change. Dropped it off last night, had all day to work on it and still waiting. Truly disappointing!
262 2018-08-02 23:27:37 I use castor oil every night and it really doesn’t do shit for me  but even the way I filled my eyebrows was so different here and idk how to do them like that anymore
263 2018-08-02 23:27:29 I don’t care how much money I got in my pocket when I go get my oil changed. I’m still only getting a oil change. 
264 2018-08-02 23:27:28 So my apthous ulcer is doing better it still hurts pretty much 24/7 (bc my teeth are always hitting it) but I’m putting numbing oil on it so now I can drink water ! :)
265 2018-08-02 23:27:22 All he needs now is to distribute bags of rice and vegetable  oil and he will win the popular vote.

270 2018-08-02 23:26:53 I don’t know why I even decided on watching shit about penguins on National Geographic. One of the babies got oil all over him, abandoned, and hasn’t eaten in months. I’m a fucking mess rn
271 2018-08-02 23:26:51 I’m getting my oil changed and there’s a dog here. Why don’t more businesses have dogs. They make waiting for things so much easier.

284 2018-08-02 23:24:58 I literally resent the part of my life whie i started substituting things like milk for water and oil for frylight/water because making hot chocolate with water tastes crap n who wanted roasties with no oil on? N now i’m too scared of the calories to change it

330 2018-08-02 23:17:52 Thanks, I find everything too strong and oil is bad for the skin. ( rather have it bad inside) so I learned. Plus I like knowing random things and could be a jack of all trades kinda things even if I can't afford the degrees for them
331 2018-08-02 23:17:50 Sometimes it’s not about the oil but the cracked vessels

thank you.
333 2018-08-02 23:17:35 Hmmmmmm 
Same thing happens to me, especially during the summer months when my pores produce more oil (I have combo skin). So it might just be you're pumpin out more oil, like if you spent a lot of time outside, and it's helping to clog em up. Maybe try a charcoal mask?
334 2018-08-02 23:17:31 That's what he wants! So him and his cronies that have oil investments can make a killing

364 2018-08-02 23:13:41 Personal attacks just proves a lack of reasoned argument.  Our oil money has been propping UK up for past 50 years.  We have had large scale immigration in the past plus we have had large scale emigration to US, Canada, Australia etc. And they did OK.
365 2018-08-02 23:13:35 All in the name of profit for the oil companies! Health and environment be damned.
366 2018-08-02 23:13:24 Happy to hear Rokan oil field block is back to Indonesia. But I can't lie, there's a sad feeling inside me for the company that had been a part for making who I am today.

Thank you for everything, @Chevron.
367 2018-08-02 23:13:21 yes. beautiful. One egg and one slice of cheese is enough for the need of protein and oil of body. And as much as water.

369 2018-08-02 23:13:15 This is ridiculous everything that Obamas name is attached to he is going to undo.  It probably has to do with russian oil as well trying to keep Putin happy.  When will this nightmare end.
370 2018-08-02 23:13:12 It’s an oil that shouldn’t be injested by animals tea tree oil, lavender etc. it causes liver damage and dries out their noses

Most civilisation collapse because they where incapable of downsize in times when resource base depletion and/or environment degradation required it.
374 2018-08-02 23:11:32 How you do that starts with extract and you can't get any from water due to chemical makeup. There has to be some form of way to get a oil base substance from the thing. That holds the smell. You can't get that from water I read. I make my own perfumes. Sorry if ur disappointed

377 2018-08-02 23:10:55 Wow!  Nothing really phases me anymore from these moronic A-holes.  Trump wants to run the country like a crime boss.  All about the money.  Privatize education and the VA, deregulate the EPA, give away our national monuments to oil/mining...  Please stop.  #BlueWave
378 2018-08-02 23:10:49 He’ll no; really makes no sense since manufacturers have already built the new standards into their plans for the future!  They are moving away from the gasoline engine; but Trump trying to intervene for Big Oil!!

392 2018-08-02 23:09:28 If you have to use false monetary figures and are stuck binary deduction you clearly can’t have a real discussion about this. The whole point is moving away from oil. You’re in an industry that needs to get smaller, not bigger. I’m sure you have transferable skills.

396 2018-08-02 23:08:54 Woo! Thanks, Eric, I appreciate that you shared it. Jason, affirmations are good, I need to do that myself. I haven't tried CBD oil but fortunately I live in Colorado and I do microdose to help alleviate some of the anxiety/depression I deal with.

412 2018-08-02 23:06:47 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
413 2018-08-02 23:06:43 Toby is no oil painting but I can't argue with the obvious truth in this statement.
414 2018-08-02 23:06:41 Damn T, you're not supposed to make it that obvious when paying back your donors with political favors. He just gave Big Oil a political blow-job in front of the whole world

417 2018-08-02 23:06:17 You think of yourself as a finace expert. So would you be so kind to provide us all with a EV demand elasticity model based on oil price?

427 2018-08-02 23:04:31 Thinking about that awful asteroid movie, I think it’s worth remembering:

450 2018-08-02 23:00:37 Don’t just use lavender either.. people think it’s great for anxiety, but I would recommend White Angelica. It’s amazing. And if you don’t love the smell, that’s okay! It will still do its job, and when you cut it with coconut oil it will reduce the scent.

463 2018-08-02 22:59:26 Honestly you’ve probably heard this a million times.. but essential oils are amazing for anxiety! Just make sure you find pure oils & diffuse them. You can also cut them with Coconut Oil & wear them. I struggle with anxiety too and this helps a ton.
464 2018-08-02 22:59:21 Yeah I know what you mean, but maybe he could’ve just have been a bit annoyed because of what happened that night, and the whole oil thing probably just made it a bit worse.. everyone gets like it sometimes

538 2018-08-02 22:49:01 It is critically important we take advantage of the current anti-Putin sentiment and put it to good use. Use it to target Russia where it hurts by pushing Oil/Gas deregulation's in the US as anti-Putin measures that will make a real difference.

567 2018-08-02 22:43:49 Even if dirtier cars saved more people inside cars, extra pollution would kill more people outside of cars. Did the Moron think about that ? No, just how much he is being paid off by Big Oil and car companies #climatechange #globalwarming
568 2018-08-02 22:43:44 If that is not proof of being in bed with big oil I don’t what it will take

576 2018-08-02 22:42:35 At least you’re able to stay creative and turn your anxieties and whatnot into something positive. Have you tried CBD oil? A tincture isn’t too expensive and it mellows me out when I’m starting to cycle with my anxieties.
577 2018-08-02 22:42:26 Lemongrass oil and incense are used for shapeshifting, glamours, and invisibility. This herb lends “innocence” to Trickster items and is an essential ingredient in Van Van oil.

579 2018-08-02 22:42:20 You can see a much better correlation between the use of coal (soot output) and warming. Based on darker glacier surfaces, this makes more sence to me. This also would explain the stop on warming from 1945 to 1970 because coal was more and more replaced by oil/gas plus filter.
580 2018-08-02 22:42:17 Patriarch Daniel of the Romanian Orthodox Church anointing the new headquarters of religious TV station Trinitas with holy oil. This picture caused quite a stir in Romania at the time (2014)
581 2018-08-02 22:42:16 Getting a haircut tomorrow, so obviously I'm doing a hot oil treatment tonight so my hair is nice and soft, because I crave praise from people I don't know and will never see again.
582 2018-08-02 22:42:14 4.1 GDP, African American unemployment lowest in history, cancelled TPP, has talked to Saudi Arabia about releasing more oil to bring gas prices down. Yes, lets talk about this.
583 2018-08-02 22:41:50 Why does everything I put on my dick have to be expensive — namely women and coconut oil?
584 2018-08-02 22:41:45 i like guacamole — pero kasi guacamole has other textures and tastes. Avocado, olive oil, salt? Parang ew. I’m curious but also grossed out. Feeling ko lasang papel.

587 2018-08-02 22:41:27 People & politicians took it seriously, in part because of our dependence on & vulnerability to the middle east for oil. Jimmy Carter was very concerned about our environmental future for a number of reasons. Reagan was not.
588 2018-08-02 22:41:16 Tea tree oil in my face wash. Maaaaan it’s worked WONDERS. So many of my scars cleared up!! I love it

606 2018-08-02 22:39:51 Okay put your bets in. I'm manning (womaning?) the walls here and preparing the caldrons of boiling oil. What sort of sock puppet are they going to send this time?

623 2018-08-02 22:37:50 My eyeballs are covered in coconut oil, face covered in spot cream and my eyebrows all grown out ready to be waxed... I am really not feeling myself right now 
624 2018-08-02 22:37:43 That I do get. It's got a high smoke point so it makes for an excellent oil in stir fries and other high temperature oil cooking.

630 2018-08-02 22:37:03 Here's a great tip for everyone. Whatever's cooking Skillet you are using use extra olive oil in the pan when you are cooking kale. It makes it so much easier to scrape it out and throw it in the trash love to all.

648 2018-08-02 22:34:54 What's an oil boom
649 2018-08-02 22:34:50 With oil
650 2018-08-02 22:34:33 sometimes I forget to wash my hands after scratching my ass and then I end up smelling my hand for some reason.   and for some reason it smells like fish and really old fryer oil and a hint of burnt chicken nuggets.
651 2018-08-02 22:34:29 Cons don't want to move to US, coz they want to be very wealthy in a Canada turned into a US colony, while pillaging our natural ressources. Water's right after oil & gas, on US "want" list, & Canada has 20% of Earth's total reserve. Voilà. #cdnpoli

664 2018-08-02 22:32:35 Canada's total household debt is bigger than its economy.

Sweden has recently been moving away from big-state policies, and its unemployment rate is twice ours.

Norway has as much oil wealth as Saudi Arabia.

669 2018-08-02 22:31:52 Funnily enough we have more oil than Norway. Just we have a crap Government. Who insist on squandering the proceeds on their World empire fantasy.
670 2018-08-02 22:31:50 I just changed the oil in my car. can’t tell me shit. 

also, if ya need ya oil changed, himme up. $25, but you gotta buy ya oil and ya filter.

674 2018-08-02 22:30:59 Try to stay away from night shade plants or eat less. They cause inflammation in the body. Potatoes, peppers and tomatoes are all plants form the nightshade family. Also getting enough omega 3 can help too. Flax and hemp oil in smoothies is usually what I do!

687 2018-08-02 22:29:19 That just seems completely idiotic to me!! Why would u want cars to be less fuel efficient thus more fuel and oil??
688 2018-08-02 22:29:10 Then you don’t know hurt , & you  were duped by the fakest, phony, un factual snake oil salesmen ever ! Facts yeah right

693 2018-08-02 22:28:01 I’ll get the oil
694 2018-08-02 22:27:46 I'm aware but in a year some health food blogger will push palm oil coffee as the next big cleanser
695 2018-08-02 22:27:43 Muy y totalmente traicionera. Le tracciona fx, oil y política. Combo letal.
696 2018-08-02 22:27:39 We'll be at Northey St Organic Market in Windsor on Sunday, 6-11AM. Come & enjoy the fabulous aromas of our organic essential oil blends!
697 2018-08-02 22:27:13 Agree completely on the arabs. If it were not for big oil, they would be completely out of the picture. F them. Native Americans -got screwed over - we have them where we want them - drunk on the reservation. I dont like it but it was their choice to be sovereign.
698 2018-08-02 22:27:03 Like, the donut gym? Crowe would need to gain some weight and wear some French fry oil on his face. You don’t get that Nazi splotch complexion just overnight. It takes work.
699 2018-08-02 22:26:59 Just tried CBD oil for the first time and boy am I way smarter or something
700 2018-08-02 22:26:57 Lol - the funnier part is when I freaked out and then they opened the patio and I volley’ed it into the pond and we all had to fish out the oil so their parents wouldn’t find out.
701 2018-08-02 22:26:42 surely extra yummy means you have stopped using palm oil? You know I cannot have a kit kat otherwise!
702 2018-08-02 22:26:35 Not just for he ladies but guys, I know some can’t grow a beard and barely a mustache  go get your castor oil
703 2018-08-02 22:26:30 I would like to know exactly this carbon tax has done?  I live in Alberta and the carbon tax has caused lots of oil field workers to scavenge for work or have gone out of province for work.
704 2018-08-02 22:26:28 And then the price of oil.... puppa jeesaz
705 2018-08-02 22:26:26 Listening to a tool from Americans For Prosperity, a Koch org, telling us they want more people to be able to buy cars and Obama made it so hard. They want to save people money. They are concerned. Bullshit! it's to push more oil and manipulate prices through instability of fuel.
706 2018-08-02 22:26:21 I thought I did. I took the Lexus I bought to the Lexus service center in Columbus. They told me I had an oil leak in the the engine from the head gasket ($3500!!!)

Took it to an independent mechanic, and the problem does not exist.
707 2018-08-02 22:26:21 Oil boi
708 2018-08-02 22:26:20 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling red oil....

710 2018-08-02 22:26:13 now if ppl leave me alone for at least 10 min , im hopping into the shower to get this mix of axe body spray and engine oil off my body
but think of axe scented motor oil , hmmmmmmmmm
711 2018-08-02 22:26:12 Less fuel efficient cars means more oil sold . Making the already wealthy even more so in exchange for breathable air
712 2018-08-02 22:26:12 I think it's slightly diff - oil instead of butter, but should be ace! Glad you found it 
713 2018-08-02 22:26:06 finally going to be making new stuff to post ! 
••also had to buy a different type of oil since the kind I like is too expensive and scarce in the city ..

718 2018-08-02 22:25:48 If U.A.E, Qatar and Saudi Arabia Governments used this same Oil money to develop their countries, I just wonder what we have been selling in Nigeria.... Maybe it's Oori oil or Shear butter or Black oil??

728 2018-08-02 22:24:06 I enjoy doing confusing femme things at my desk but not explaining myself. Cuticle oil, facial mists, I'm down for all the low-level spa stuff.
729 2018-08-02 22:23:58 Venezuela has failed because it nationalized its oil industry and use huge oil prices to cover up a number of issues including the death of their democracy. When oil prices crashed their economy built on oil also collapsed. It is a better lesson to diversify your economy.
730 2018-08-02 22:23:52 I bought paint thinner to clean the oil off of my paint brushes because i’m an adult now

742 2018-08-02 22:21:38 @NewsHour keeping the mpg requirement will also help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Today's politicians are definitely not future oriented. We need mass transit improvements; we need a bullet/high speed train in this country.

763 2018-08-02 22:18:57 @ninetonoon Surely any country that exports something that people need (food, water, oil, etc) is going to be better off in the long run than any country that exports something that people merely want (cheap clothes, toys, counterfeit products, etc).

770 2018-08-02 22:17:46 Some years back, I remember seeing a tweet about Okra looking like snot. Ever since then, I’ve struggled eating it & if I do, it has to have Palm Oil in it
771 2018-08-02 22:17:45 yeah because Dasani is fs oil and water!

778 2018-08-02 22:17:14 Your idea to roll back air pollution and fuel economy standards is just reckless! Just when EV’s are gaining traction, you want to pull the plug! In the pocket of the oil companies? Fool!

781 2018-08-02 22:16:54 The oil crisis of 1972 is a better analogy. There will be disruption inevitably the only question is whether it’s for three months or a decade. That’s largely down to ERG and Jacob Rees Mogg.
782 2018-08-02 22:16:48 @realDonaldTrump really doesn't know what he's talking about changing the gas mileage requirement. Not only will the increase mpg affect climate change but it will also reduce our dependence on oil from foreign countries

787 2018-08-02 22:16:37 You boil first, then when it's soft. Keep it aside. Then heat up a separate pot, put groundnut oil, sliced onions, sliced pepper and sliced tomato then fry it for few minutes. After that pour your beans in, stir and add the necessary salt, thyme and maggi.Leave to simmer. Se fini

836 2018-08-02 22:09:20 So it looks like the van isn’t running anymore. Josh may send a mechanic out to look at it, but at this point it’s probably wiser to sell it for scraps. We’re cutting it close to the move-out date and not only have I not had the oil and engine checked, it doesn’t even run. :/

866 2018-08-02 22:05:28 Only some questionable canola oil!
867 2018-08-02 22:05:27 Nothing is more civilized than government sanctioned murder of our own.  Boiling people in oil ahhh those were the days.
868 2018-08-02 22:05:18 I don’t have olive oil!!
869 2018-08-02 22:05:14 Huckabee family is as repulsive as it gets... chronic liars. Snake oil salesman, and doggie killers.... and of course Bongo loves them....

875 2018-08-02 22:04:23 So dogs don't get clipped? Think it's better to use polyester (oil) or cotton (GM from water scarce areas) than wool? Whole point of such competitions is to improve the standard so sheep are on the boards for minimal time and sheared without grazes or mishandling.
876 2018-08-02 22:04:06 Nope, sorry, I was born and raised in central Alberta, and plan to stay. That’s why I’ll never vote Conservative, this is my home and I want a government that represents the people here, not oil interests.
877 2018-08-02 22:03:59 Adam and I spent our day on vacation exploring some towns and buying oil paintings for our house. I feel I’ve reached a new level of adulting. 
878 2018-08-02 22:03:57 Different reasons then. We were too reliant on foreign oil and it crippled us. Now, carbon emissions are rising and we are getting closer to an exhausted supply. You don’t want to wait until it’s gone to find something else
879 2018-08-02 22:03:55 I worked for top tax lawyer for a Fortune 500 oil company for many years, prior to conversion to Democrat.  At the time, I swallowed the cool aid it was entirely appropriate to take advantage of tax laws to avoid paying US income taxes for 22 years.  We live and learn.
880 2018-08-02 22:03:43 Wrong, Read the 911 Commision bipartisan report,  Sadam Hussain was allowing Osama bin Laden to train his Soldiers in Iraq. And it was Sadam that Invaded Kuwait, and set their oil fields on fire, Sadam Hussain also defied the UN  for crimes against his own people.
881 2018-08-02 22:03:37 Coolant and oil leaks are covered by the original manufacturer’s warranty.

884 2018-08-02 22:03:25 I use witch hazel toner and tea tree oil and it has changeddddd my life like my acne wasn’t bad but it was definitely there and it has helped clear up my complexion so much!!!

889 2018-08-02 22:02:45 We have top vape liquids in store along with CBD oil as well. Coming soon we will have CBD hemp nugs in stock.
890 2018-08-02 22:02:30 2.Рокфеллеры(Standard Oil, ныне Exxon)тоже активно сотрудничали с нацистами.Также,как и компании Coca-Cola,Nestle,Shell,IKEA...И это только самые крупные и известные из всех тех фирм,что сотрудничали с нацистской Германией.А так-их тысячи,по всей Европе и Америке.
891 2018-08-02 22:02:14 Try Jamaican castor oil.
892 2018-08-02 22:02:05 this she’s happy oil is good dab 
893 2018-08-02 22:01:30 It does look like oil, but thats how the hibachi joints do sake.
894 2018-08-02 22:01:27 A little coconut oil and you could be my personal pina colada!!! Save travels back to FL!!!
895 2018-08-02 22:01:23 Does cbd  oil really help with anxiety???????? I  want to try it
896 2018-08-02 22:01:16 And what are Matt's thoughts on shail oil exploration in the GBRMP?
897 2018-08-02 22:01:15 Non è un complotto, si chiamano strategie geopolitiche ed hanno obbiettivo il settore energetico, principalmente oil&gas. Io lavoro nel settore...quindi so di cosa sto parlando. Te ne sai qualcosa? Se ti dico North Stream 2? Zohr? Sai di cosa sto parlando?
898 2018-08-02 22:01:10 Sold in June or 2008 and never looked back....nothing has worked other than some short term work in spot oil tankers a couple of years ago
899 2018-08-02 22:01:06 Non è un complotto, si chiamano strategie geopolitiche ed hanno obbiettivo il settore energetico, principalmente oil&gas. Io lavoro nel settore...quindi so di cosa sto parlando. Te ne sai qualcosa? Se ti dico North Stream 2? Zohr? Sai di cosa sto parlando?
900 2018-08-02 22:01:00 Why repair shops close to early, I need a oil change
901 2018-08-02 22:00:44 Zero sum game played with people's lives.

Fake agreements with tyrants,that go nowhere.

Drill/waste oil/rape the environment.

902 2018-08-02 22:00:38 I would be out of the one essential oil I actually need right now

908 2018-08-02 22:00:16 Some sautéed vegetables in olive oil sounds so good rn
909 2018-08-02 22:00:14 you can try a product called Bio Oil, or vitamin E oil, or rosehip oil, rub it onto your scar everyday and it will help it to fade.
910 2018-08-02 22:00:13 One of my mentors always said, “the squeaky wheel gets the oil!” Best if luck to you!
911 2018-08-02 22:00:05 Gaspacho, roost them, make a puree, cut them in cubes and add mutzzarela with some blasamic vinager, olive oil, parsley, pepper and salt, use them as a base for a papilot fish, etc
912 2018-08-02 22:00:05 “ummm.....do you know where I can buy CBD oil?” - me checking into hell
913 2018-08-02 22:00:00 Mr. Issa Tchiroma as long you people loot our oil reserves we will continue to laugh about your cheap blame game. Please abstain from any further reply.
914 2018-08-02 21:59:58 I have been using CBD oil since April and I am loving the results. I have my life back
915 2018-08-02 21:59:54 The republicans got gas prices up to nearly $5 a gallon when Bush promised big oil investors a windfall after funding his campaign at a moments notice. Mama Mia here we go again!!
916 2018-08-02 21:59:48 The GOP currently supports coal and oil.
917 2018-08-02 21:59:41 It is a veg based protective oil, used by Japanese woodworkers. The oil protects from rust but also doesn't transfer stains to the wood apparently.
I have just been using wax paste as the tools never sit long enough rust, and workshop is pretty dry.
918 2018-08-02 21:59:14 Can hear Anth cursing, oil splattering, and crush going crazy upstairs while he is trying to cook dinner...contemplating chick-fil-a atm
919 2018-08-02 21:59:10 I mean... I prefer your profile pic. A hot guy with #TimKennedyAbs and #Guns 

Yes. Please!
920 2018-08-02 21:59:03 another bird update; we have to wait till tomorrow when the hospital opens, but he’s been ok, got some of the oil off of its feathers n I think it’s white! He’s eating n drinking, n he’s likes sitting on my stomach n sleeping it’s moe
921 2018-08-02 21:58:54 Had this last night. Had 2 sips of this last night. Then it went down the drain. This is an abomination, guys. It tastes like poison and tanning oil. It looks like sewage. It may be the worst beer I've ever had, and I love beer...and pina coladas.
922 2018-08-02 21:58:41 Evil Man now you want to use Religion to hide your #1trillion you and the oil goddess Alison take on oil deal under Goodluck Administration.
923 2018-08-02 21:58:27 “What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving, Sir."

"So it is, so it is; if we get it."

"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, Sir."
924 2018-08-02 21:58:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
925 2018-08-02 21:58:00 Tea tree oil 
926 2018-08-02 21:57:59 Ne cooking oil
927 2018-08-02 21:57:48 You can say rubbish, this man was treasurer in Mobil oil in 1990s. You are here saying shit
928 2018-08-02 21:57:48 You get champagne, and you get champagne, and YOU get champagne!!!  
929 2018-08-02 21:57:20 Most recipes you can use your favorite dairy free milk and light olive oil in place of milk and butter.
930 2018-08-02 21:57:13 And yet many farmers still vote for the Nationals, who are financially supported by fossil fuel interests (eg Rinehart), who are themselves climate change denialists, and who openly promote more coal, oil, and gas extraction. A vote for the Nationals is a vote for your own demise
931 2018-08-02 21:57:12 If you can easily lose control of an authentication system by external entities it is a bad system. 2fA must mean you are in physical control all the time of that factor. Anything else is just useless bullshit and snake oil.
932 2018-08-02 21:56:40 coconut oil is key 
933 2018-08-02 21:56:38 Next time put in inside oil before swallowing. Thank me later
934 2018-08-02 21:56:36 i actually went and got an oil change for my car
935 2018-08-02 21:56:32 Lately I like taking a warm, half-hour soak in the tub with a cup of epsom salt, half a cup of baking soda, and a few drops of lavender oil.  I'll often read comics and stuff on my phone (which I'll put in a Ziploc).

Also: Drawing, writing, video games, naps.
936 2018-08-02 21:56:30 Hey @cocksailor, let’s go whaling tomorrow. We can get a bunch of oil to use in our lamps and you can get some whale meat to salt up.
937 2018-08-02 21:56:05 I would say it's going to be significantly more than the cost of topping the oil up, even for the next x years, assuming I keep the thing
938 2018-08-02 21:56:05 $AAPL at one trillion is an amazing feat. Glad it didn’t go to an oil company
939 2018-08-02 21:55:59 Come on you are involved in crypto and you don't have the answer to a related economy 101 question..? Competition, supply, demand, and oil prices all to create a load factor and fill seats to raise prices to the highest point they can.
940 2018-08-02 21:55:59 Mine is def. missing the ZING ingredient, but heavy on the oil separation. Sometimes I really miss the Skippy.
941 2018-08-02 21:55:57 I am not going to deny the problems but this is a different political and economic context....also in Britain our economy does not rely so heavily on oil prices
942 2018-08-02 21:55:55 Clean oil?! Maybe he should go take a swim in it and see how clean he comes out!
943 2018-08-02 21:55:25 I'm hoping its anything but vinegar or oil
944 2018-08-02 21:55:13 is it just me or does your car drive all nice after an oil change and tire rotation?
945 2018-08-02 21:55:06 I had one that was "I made your shortbread thumbprints. I didn't have butter so I used vegetable oil instead, and I'm not really a citrus zest person so I left that out. They ran all over the pan and the giant flat cookie was rather plain tasting."
946 2018-08-02 21:55:01 I have actually.  Was told point blank in the oil field that Halliburton received subsidies for hiring minorities and i wouldn't be considered for the job.Nice job totally dodging the point here.... the double standard is disgusting and no amount of mental gymnastics justifies it
947 2018-08-02 21:54:56 True in the short-term only. It's the net energy from fossil fuels that allows us to pay interest on any investment. Money is just a proxy for future energy. As we rely more on lower net-energy oil (tarsands, deepwater, fracked), returns will all dwindle.
948 2018-08-02 21:54:51 What does camellia oil do?
949 2018-08-02 21:54:48 Put the potatoes in the microwave for 10 mins prior to the oven then put a little cooking oil and seasoning on them pop in oven for only 20 mins and are lovely :)
950 2018-08-02 21:54:47 Then I left my cuticle oil in my truck 
951 2018-08-02 21:54:30 I’m wondering is it water, some type of oil, maybe a really light sauce???? 
952 2018-08-02 21:54:14 PNP left the oil edge you stop the edge and still collecting the tax. Stop the tax refund Jamaicans.
953 2018-08-02 21:54:02 Try Tung Oil it is a natural wood preservative
954 2018-08-02 21:54:02 I hate waiting !!!!! This oil change better be quick.
955 2018-08-02 21:54:01 it takes to figure out what works best for you, but i got a tip from a friend of mine to use oil (preferrably olive oil) to clean your face, and then rinse it with warm water afterwards, then cold like sami says, and moisturize!
956 2018-08-02 21:53:58 Camellia oil from Axminster Tools?
957 2018-08-02 21:53:56 The oil in Alaska belongs to Alaska.

National security will remain at the centre, but there will be state police.

I propose as president that Nigeria should recruit 1.5m new police personnel.

The Central Bank will remain at the centre.
958 2018-08-02 21:53:56 @trapo really inspiring 
This Oil Change is super dope
959 2018-08-02 21:53:47 So @Netmums put a @CherylOfficial quote to help #busymums “You don't always get time to moisturise when you've jumped in the shower quickly,’ she explained. ‘So I go in the bath and put bath oil in so I'm moisturised when I get out.” You have  for a  ? 
960 2018-08-02 21:53:44 They’re just trying to sell you some bs anyway I wouldn’t even step back there in them I’d be like I’m good fam pull it around  gonna be mad when you catch an oil stain
961 2018-08-02 21:53:20 And that 90's 30 weight oil in his hair.
962 2018-08-02 21:53:14 髪キシキシするやつ(´Д` )
963 2018-08-02 21:53:08 Saudi-UAEcoalition had 2 oil tankers damaged by the Houthis & stopped their tankers going thru. Now aggressive airstrikes on the strategic Hodeida Port (reason they want Yemen).A fish market was hit &body parts strewn, just 20 metres away from al-ThawraHospital. Dead30&60Wounded.
964 2018-08-02 21:53:07 ok i am gonna get a pizza and hope the oil doesnt make the acne on my nose worse lmao
965 2018-08-02 21:53:07 The oil and the grease is the flavour 
966 2018-08-02 21:53:04 My stomach has been reallllll iffy since my coworker had me add that MCT oil to my tea earlier 
967 2018-08-02 21:52:46 What is the reason for this? Do the automakers want it? Oil producers? The state of CA certainly doesn't.
968 2018-08-02 21:52:23 bio oil girl! use it twice a day for a few weeks straight and you will see results! just massage it in really well :) there’s been times i see it instantly take affect on small bruises
969 2018-08-02 21:52:22 "If I break your heart na Oil spillage"- Duncan Mighty.....Wene ehhhh!
970 2018-08-02 21:52:19 Oil boom oil boom, is oil not booming now? How much was oil in OBJ regime?
971 2018-08-02 21:52:08 i came here to judge. Olive oil?????
972 2018-08-02 21:51:45 Hang in there and get your rest asap! Try a lavender bath if you have any essential oil 
973 2018-08-02 21:51:41 I personally love roasted beets. I cover them in olive oil and paprika!

975 2018-08-02 21:51:38 Lmao I think everything is a scam for my car other than oil and gas. That shits fine, leave me alone.
976 2018-08-02 21:51:13 CBD oil is literally a miracle in a bottle.
977 2018-08-02 21:51:11 Of course It’s Labor’s fault that these criminals had to corruptly gift $440 mill to a foundation of gas, oil and coal CEOs without the capability to produce results because Labor abandoned the reef. Labor, Labor, Labor.
978 2018-08-02 21:51:02 Did the Trump admin really say out loud that they would line the pockets of big oil companies? Really literally say that???
979 2018-08-02 21:50:50 VRTK is THE reason my HS students could make VR training apps like how to...change a tire, jumpstart a dead battery, and change the oil...A real game changer. Even have 1 student going into the dev field bc of it, right @layman_18 ?
980 2018-08-02 21:50:50 llevo mazo sin hacerme las cejas la escusa oficial es que me estoy echando castor oil y quiero ver si me funciona la de verdad es que no tengo ni un tiempo para tener un minimo de self care
981 2018-08-02 21:50:38 I heard Phillips say that Alberta has the highest growth rate in Canada because of her climate policy.  She meant "despite" her climate policy.  Highest growth rate because we were sooo deep in the hole three years ago & oil has gone from $43 to $70.
982 2018-08-02 21:50:32 “If i break your heart na oil spillage, i study this ur love for freedom college, nne u too sweet like yam porridge” duncan mighty isnt ur Mcm’s mate oooooo #LovaLova
983 2018-08-02 21:50:09 tomorrow I work from home. and by home, I mean the cafe next to the Honda service center while I get my oil changed.
984 2018-08-02 21:50:06 Olive oil is better.
985 2018-08-02 21:50:01 CBD oil tastes like I’ve just licked the smell of 80’s wallpaper in my nans house 

But oh boi is she magic 
986 2018-08-02 21:49:53 Olive Oil is over rated
987 2018-08-02 21:49:39 Got my fix at the nail salon  & why I just buy the cuticle oil & nail polish 
988 2018-08-02 21:49:18 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
989 2018-08-02 21:49:18 end trumps ratings, starve his msn masters who gave him 5 Billion worth of pro-trump media attention during the israeli, corp, big oil oligarch rigged u.s. election. NDAATrump manufactures fake news, calls real news fake news, meanwhile Murdochs FOX & genieenergy make billions.
990 2018-08-02 21:49:18 Who writes this crap? Some deluded oil rigger from Aberdeen me thinks
991 2018-08-02 21:49:05 If you use them often enough I don't think rust would be an issue. If they are left sitting for long cold seasons then rust could be an issue leather or not.
You could wax or oil them if they are going to sit for a while.
992 2018-08-02 21:48:52 Except by his government who does as it pleases with it to its convenience. Yes THANKS St Vincent and the Grenadines you truly prove that the smell of oil is stronger than that of blood. #NicarguaUnida #GRITOPORNICARAGUA
993 2018-08-02 21:48:50 what about pizza with a garlic oil base. thats just cheesy bread, isnt it? or is it pizza with a garlic oil base?

998 2018-08-02 21:47:32 Aleast is not from government money. 1991 as a treasurer in Mobil oil, he was main sponsor of candidate in SDP for Gubernatorial in 1991 election. Main sponsor for NAdeco

1000 2018-08-02 21:47:22 with an oil company is that they are over spilling when they are unloading and filling the tanks on Turtle cheese underneath Turtle key are the most beautiful sea turtles and their is their habitat Oprah Winfrey stealing from darling Industries building for sure 1 and 2 illegally

1003 2018-08-02 21:47:06 Step 1. Blot the stain to remove excess oil.
Step 2. ???
Step 3. Profit!

1005 2018-08-02 21:46:29 Is it really sustainable for humans to consume resources that require millions of years in the making?
Sun is sure to rise each day&give off renewable energy we can tap into infinitely(only limited by tech's retention capacity)but oil is finite& its creation is a lengthy process

1009 2018-08-02 21:46:16 Do it again and you’re blocked btw, you know who you are
1010 2018-08-02 21:46:09 Should I pay $20 extra for an oil change to support a black owned business or go somewhere else and save $20????? Help 
1011 2018-08-02 21:46:06 Kinda like waiving the whole 'you have to have your own stadium to be in  MLS' just so he could get some sheikh oil money into MLS?

Yeah, he makes up his own rules at this point.

I think #SaveTheCrew is shaking up his world though.

1015 2018-08-02 21:45:48 People use acs all the time as a weapon to control people, see what happens if you want to give your child with epilepsy CBD oil rather than meds, you will get a visit from CPS and they might even remove your child. I read these stories every day.
1016 2018-08-02 21:45:45 It's standard when you're having to travel to a different location, like when MLA's are in Victoria for session or oil workers are in a camp.
1017 2018-08-02 21:45:43 Can’t compare Tesla’s to others. They drive like nothing else & never going to a gas station or getting an oil change are worthy perks. And my initial design came to $40k-after credits, so not bad. But this sounds like another Apple discussion where we’re not going to agree. ;)
1018 2018-08-02 21:45:38 So the master plan is to wreck the most reliable/stable oil provider the US had for decades, destroying the oil industry itself in the process (& any other industry for that matter), hurting as much ppl as possible to then go and take all that free oil with bare hands? Smart.
1019 2018-08-02 21:45:31 Ah yes I love when my mother talks back to me in a mocking voice like she is 6 
1020 2018-08-02 21:44:48 They could be bigger than what Apple is now because they don't only provide the cars, they provide the energy for them. 

It'd be like Honda not only owning their cars, but every fuel station and the oil for the fuel station. They could be HUGE.
1021 2018-08-02 21:44:37 3 things:
1. Olives (& olive oil)
2. People that don’t flop on plans 
3. Deep sleep.
1022 2018-08-02 21:44:33 @POTUS Let us (MwSol Corp, a start up) help produce US oil shale and heavy oil to make America independent of oil imports.  Help us reach that goal.
1023 2018-08-02 21:44:30 Everything isn't medical. 
Some things need to be addressed with prayer, fasting, oil, and hands being laid. 
As saints, we should not be oppressed and tormented. 
Jesus came to give us an abundant life. 
Be free in the name of Jesus! 

1024 2018-08-02 21:44:22 Quite handy being in a long distance relationship sometimes for instance tonight where I’m going to bed with a shower cap on cos I’ve got conditioner on my hair and I’ve got so much facial oil on you could fry an egg on me face

Oh and also only shaving your legs once a month
1025 2018-08-02 21:44:08 Yep. Look at the buddy members of that foundation they include CEOs and directors of BHP, Shell, Peabody Energy (coal) QANTAS. One founding member was Ian McFarlane a shale oil developer.

Chef Eros: Here's a plate of Fettuccini pasta w/ Olive oil stirfried garlic with a side of steak seared in peanut flour and hot spices, and a glass of lime gin infused fresh mint soda.
1039 2018-08-02 21:43:02 With olive oil for savory or honey butter for sweet.
1040 2018-08-02 21:42:39 Okay let's wait for it.

1044 2018-08-02 21:41:49 @POTUS Support the MwSol Corp.start up intend on making America Oil independent.  Its pulse patented microwave technology produces heavy oil and extracts kerogen from Oil shale with ease.  Open shale oil production in the US.
1045 2018-08-02 21:41:28 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

1058 2018-08-02 21:40:33 I went to get my oil changed today. They didn’t ask to do any other random shit to my car. This is what dreams are made of.

1060 2018-08-02 21:40:16 Most Hemi's do not have this problem, ever. So either pick up seal  was nicked/cut, a problem with the pump itself or a bearing issue plocking an oil port. Since you say there is pressure now ( did you connect a mechanical gauge to the block ) I would presume the seal first.

1070 2018-08-02 21:39:34 I added some drying agent to mine, it dried much quicker, dry to the touch within 24hrs. Corsik drying agent - purple stuff. Was very much like normal oil based paint drying times
1071 2018-08-02 21:39:28 Yummy. Oil used?
1072 2018-08-02 21:39:28 smart cats know that when The Donald tweets, a sad wolf has brainfreeze #impeach

1080 2018-08-02 21:38:25 i hate coming to get my oil changed alone this bitch just REALLY tried to sell me blinker fluid.
1081 2018-08-02 21:38:20 Oh my. Vegetal, tart, buttery Chardonnay with layers of concentrated olive oil.
1082 2018-08-02 21:38:19 The Administration's plan is to use as much oil & gas as possible....if coal could fuel cars....he would add it to the list.
1083 2018-08-02 21:38:17 But if you spray a little coconut oil on your kale, it makes it so much easier to scrape all of it out of your pan,,,,,  and into the garbage.
1084 2018-08-02 21:38:14 Wonderful work - but is it just me that reads onesoilplatform as Ones Oil Platform ( could be my unavoidable british pretension)
1085 2018-08-02 21:37:58 Hey @elonmusk we have way too much rain water here in Virginia. Any ideas on ways to transport it efficiently to places that actually need it to fight wild fires and feed crops and livestock? Maybe we pretend it's oil?
1086 2018-08-02 21:37:54 omg lucky oil just oozes out from me

1090 2018-08-02 21:37:37 Buy squid tubes, cut up. Dust in flour, dip in batter (flour, cold water & seasoning), drop in hot oil in pan. They float to the surface. Done.
1091 2018-08-02 21:37:37 @advocatemahere can’t you take oil face’s job? 
1092 2018-08-02 21:37:35 That ought to keep the folks in the oil business happy, and the ones with breathing problems coughing.
1093 2018-08-02 21:37:34 Young man, just because it's twitter doesn't mean you should take every opportunity to show your warrior skills. Save the strength till when you have to lose the nuts and bolts of your next customer's vehicle. 
If you want to know, I never insulted you. You did but it's fine.
1094 2018-08-02 21:37:32 I used dry light instead of vegetable oil for the first time cooking my chicken and I must say, I don’t miss the oily taste 
1095 2018-08-02 21:37:29 There was, i changed it immediately.  It has oil pressure in my driveway,  but im certain that pickup tube is the cause.  Dont see oil pumps failing too often. Been a mechanic forever. Have seen a few failures on small block chevys due to pickup tube falling out.
1096 2018-08-02 21:37:28 aku pake acnes oil control cream atau kadang ponds oil control. mantul sih
1097 2018-08-02 21:37:18 Use aloe Vera gel on your face everyday and coconut oil on your body everyday. Apply banana skin peel (The inside of it) on face and rinse off after 10 mins everyday to apply aloe gel.
1098 2018-08-02 21:37:15 I KNOW THEY WONT GO AWAY!! I sprayed tanning oil all over my legs but those spots and still didn’t do anything

1100 2018-08-02 21:37:08 Trump moved the bar on EPA gas mileage standards From 50 mpg to 37.

He just loves sucking the dick of big oil and the Saudis .

Gas is going up and the environment is going down.

Ask folks in California if they believe in climate change.
1101 2018-08-02 21:36:16 They have to stop voting for the Nationals who all promote fossil fuel - oil, gas, and coal. They are all climate change denialists. The Nationals don't represent farmers any more.
1102 2018-08-02 21:36:15 their body in pieces can't still be in detroit

1103 2018-08-02 21:36:11 If it gets uncomfortable quickly be sure to invest in some beard oil. Gets rid of the itching and make your beard feel/smell luxurious
1104 2018-08-02 21:36:10 And what about other special interests groups that fund democrats and republicans. Oil companies bought both parties and are destroying our environment, air and drinking water. This also leads to the deaths of Americans. Vote for Jose that do t take corporate money, not just blue
1105 2018-08-02 21:36:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1106 2018-08-02 21:36:07 also if you just buy a cheap bottle of 100% jojoba oil that is often incredibly helpful, it's the closest to skin's natural sebum! i use it a lot layered over super light oils if i need a little something extra, or on its own, or even just on my body
1107 2018-08-02 21:36:06 If that's clean oil, I've got a clean poo they can have to polish.
1108 2018-08-02 21:36:00 Slept until noon idk why, got a slush, then changed the oil on my car, went to soccer store to look to see what ’s I’m getting the kids for my camp next week, now doing laundry. Yup wasted a good day

1119 2018-08-02 21:35:06 Coconut oil is the best thermometer
1120 2018-08-02 21:34:51 But we absolutely must *start* with an accurate understanding of how oil cos and Republicans have obscured the truth about climate change. (Or, if not start with, at least not obscure...)
1121 2018-08-02 21:34:50 Why "real culprits"? Oil apologist?
1122 2018-08-02 21:34:19 Dealership: We can get you in at 8am for that oil change. 

Also the dealership: Here for your 8am oil change? Great, it’s going to be about an hour and a half....
1123 2018-08-02 21:34:16 If you had both education and sense you'll hv deduced the simple message of the tweet,not to come and be asking me silly questions.
In life,you get what you deserve.
1124 2018-08-02 21:34:12 Niggas don’t know how to fight, change oil, or nothing. You niggas just do drugs & cry
1125 2018-08-02 21:34:12 Hey Paul - why do you focus on saturated fats and not unsaturated fats like olive oil and avocado? Typically always hear people say fat, carbs, and protein but you mention saturated and just curious if there is a benefit you see from them specifically

1130 2018-08-02 21:33:57 this kind of getup only works for players like oil king because his shorts are a meme and a thing people actually talk about i guess i dont see the appeal of why make it look like yourself id rather look cool than myself in a game
1131 2018-08-02 21:33:54 The problem is not fuel efficiency standards the problem is oil companies pockets in car maker pockets until we stop relying on oil cars and truck will not be fuel efficient let's compromise fuel efficiency so Exxon can make more money that's the answer.
1132 2018-08-02 21:33:32 oh the oil industry loves trump too.
This is backward thinking though.
People buy the vehicles they want regardless of gas mileage. 
Regulating or deregulating makes no difference. But breathing means everything. Clean driving please.
1133 2018-08-02 21:33:24 Oh my :o this will replace the oil *-*
1134 2018-08-02 21:33:21 الله يجزاك الجنه
1135 2018-08-02 21:33:18 Did I miss that we the USA have pulled out of Syria?? (you know a country that didn't invite us there and we are actively trying to split into two parts so we can run some oil and gas lines through the non existant country of Kurdistan).

But yeh...like lets worry about FB posts.

1154 2018-08-02 21:30:47 Anybody use that Wild Growth Hair Oil? And if so what were your results?
1155 2018-08-02 21:30:42 I think the blame can be spread among the consumers and the producers.

When BP has a huge oil spill in the ocean destroying marine life, you don’t exactly hear people saying “blame the consumers who drive the cars that use the fuel from the oil!!”
1156 2018-08-02 21:30:39 Coconut oil makes my pussy miserable, same with spit :(
1157 2018-08-02 21:30:38 was planning on sitting in mr. lube eating mcdonald’s while i got an oil change, but i got there too late so now i’m sitting in a parking lot eating the mcdonald’s i bought, listening to Nothing Here Is Permanent @bearingsband

1159 2018-08-02 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1160 2018-08-02 21:30:11 Also, not seeing enough canola oil and leeks for my liking.
1161 2018-08-02 21:30:06 has anyone here tried Doogro’s mega thick hair oil — me and my hair are tryna level up.
1162 2018-08-02 21:29:59 I hate coming to get a oil change for my car 
1163 2018-08-02 21:29:55 You'll get the oil spillage o
1164 2018-08-02 21:29:52 If only this Chigumba knew that in a new Zimbabwe she will go to a nice beauty spa rather than using Olive oil on her face
1165 2018-08-02 21:29:34 Dear well-raised white, black, gray, blue, purple, green, red, yellow, orange (<<my fav!!) men:  I appreciate you. Thank you for holding doors for me, for changing my oil, for calling me "ma'am," for being providers, for being who God made you to be without apologizing for it 
1166 2018-08-02 21:29:23 America (@BarackObama) is the quintessence of hypocrisy, they claimed to protect to rights of the people when they murdered Muammar Gaddafi. Why can't they do the same in Zimbabwe? Is it because there is no oil there? #ZimElections2018
1167 2018-08-02 21:29:15 Then the cooking oil face tells us to stay tuned for 60more mins.....It's over
1168 2018-08-02 21:29:06 i can’t wait to go ham on this grilled chicken breast i’ve had marinating in oil and spices
1169 2018-08-02 21:29:00 Which skincare range is best for 20 year old with extremely dry skin but it often breaks out after a few hours then my skin gets veeeeery oil.
1170 2018-08-02 21:28:40 The dollar is valuable because of the infrastructure built by US MNCs which include payment systems, products & services, accounting standards, democratic system, rule of law, branding ( soft power) , guns, oil ( geopolitics), IMF, world bank, giant banks.
1171 2018-08-02 21:28:40 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
1172 2018-08-02 21:28:37 I wish! One where the Putin isn't causing trouble, Hillary won in the states, the Referendum never happened, and we have PR and a government something like Sweden,  high taxes, well spent. And let's go a bit further back - we invested the money from north sea oil like Norway did.

1174 2018-08-02 21:28:21 When you try to correct @Laura88Lee when she says “oil” “conciler” and so on. Lol
1175 2018-08-02 21:28:12 Really in November there is a purchase of Marine grade unleaded gas at an Imperial oil outlet. Was this for the boat she was driving over the snow or did she store it someplace to use in the summer?
1176 2018-08-02 21:28:05 Cleaning up oil spills

I’ve never agreed with Cotton. Just Words. I Always, read Every Word and what that Word means and how they’re using it.
1178 2018-08-02 21:27:56 Yet our government is still spending money searching for oil.
1179 2018-08-02 21:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1180 2018-08-02 21:27:32 coconut oil cures everything. 
want better hair? put coconut oil on it.
face breaking out? put coconut oil on it.
having a bad day? put coconut oil on it.
the guy you like is acting up? put coconut oil on it. 
stressed out? put coconut oil on it.
1181 2018-08-02 21:27:26 I have come to despise them. They are out right deceitful liars.That is why they so despise @POTUS . 
They know they are losing the control.
1182 2018-08-02 21:27:10 Meghan's so cute. Slick that
loose  hair with a little coconut oil girl. Love her in yellow.
1183 2018-08-02 21:27:02 Sounds exotic. Find an oil drum and grill the pigeons under the bridge, sharing with friends whilst singing rule Britannia.
1184 2018-08-02 21:26:58 trump has not only refused to be apart of the Paris climate change accord , trump has ERASED THE REGULATIONS FOR CLEAN WATER &CLEAN AIR among others such as OIL SPILLS  to protect the ppl of AMERICA, again showing YOU how much YOU are WORTH as opposed to the big corporations !$!$
1185 2018-08-02 21:26:47 It's exactly the same thing as what happened with Irak...  The U.S. killed the previous president to replace him with one who would allow them to get the oil...

Now the Russians threw dirt on Hillary Clinton to put their puppet in the Oval Office...
1186 2018-08-02 21:26:43 It was in the budget under Obama,  too. But he did make a stand against it.  

Trump won't because he supports sport hunting, and his buddies behind the scenes are Big Oil and Big Cattle.
1187 2018-08-02 21:26:37 Lmao my mom came yesterday in my room and started putting holy oil on my door, closets, windows and my forehead lol.
1188 2018-08-02 21:26:31 Definitely prefer baby oil than WD-40 (hubby’s choice) to fix our squeaky doors.  don’t tell him... lol
1189 2018-08-02 21:26:28 Was he ever that good?
Signed as Gerrard’s replacement. Four seasons. Averaged less than 3 goals a year from a box to box midfielder, who often looked very sluggish. Keita & Ox make him look like an oil tanker. Arsed!
1190 2018-08-02 21:26:20 Im sorry someone let the little Dem outta the cage and Colorado let Oil
N Grass loose in Colorado. Yes,bunch of folks got lots of cash but without getting too crass...money does screw up acity,country,nation. Colorado s in horrible condition.
1191 2018-08-02 21:25:51 Couple of things to take into consideration, oil can contain gluten, so if you order chips (fries) from a take away, make sure they don’t use the same oil to fry anything with breadcrumbs I.e batter, breaded chicken etc
1192 2018-08-02 21:25:46 amborohwa nejombo akawira mu cooking oil
1193 2018-08-02 21:25:36 Remember Ric: "No baby oil!" ;)
1194 2018-08-02 21:25:18 I'm sick.
And out of thieves oil.

Anyone have some for a really good deal. Fast?
1195 2018-08-02 21:25:12 Juto: Cooking with the MTC motherfucker!
Samatoki: First you heat the pan, and then add your oil-
Riou: Then you get the possums
Juto and Samatoki: RIOU NO
1196 2018-08-02 21:25:08 wish the weather would make its mind up, hate never knowing if I’m gonna be taking off my makeup with solid or liquid coconut oil, never know if I’m coming or going
1197 2018-08-02 21:25:04 “99% Cannabis oil, anything less than that is liquified bullshit.” August arched a brow at Johnny with a look of surprise. This guy wasn’t your average run of the mill hipster asshole. “Don’t take too much, you’ll be communing with whatever God you believe in.”
1198 2018-08-02 21:25:03 I wonder what this guy is still doing in APC
1199 2018-08-02 21:25:01 well they make lash serums, but i just have a little bottle of caster oil & i dip a q tip in it & run it along my eye lid/lash line before bed every other night. it helps strengthen & grow your lashes! 
1200 2018-08-02 21:24:58 US wants a war with Iran..Say bipartisan? In Two party plutocracy US?
Israel and Russia is now running the US foreign policy program anyway. Israel always. A new one with Russia. War is coming in Iran. Israel-Putin-Trump wants its. Lots of oil there..
1201 2018-08-02 21:24:53 The gold backed Euro promise of stability to middle eastern oil producers, take two!

1206 2018-08-02 21:24:13 Sup brah, in the back
1207 2018-08-02 21:24:06 I'm covered in oil.  I need to go home so I can take this 3hr long shower...
1208 2018-08-02 21:23:55 The doors in my apartment started squeaking so I used Olive Oil to grease the hinges. Is that a very Italian thing to do??
1209 2018-08-02 21:23:54 @SPhillipsAB What a pile of BS - Alberta is leading the country in growth because oil has gone from $43 to $70, not because of your climate policy. Our growth % is high but we’re not close to where we were in 2014.
1210 2018-08-02 21:23:44 Mocking the terror of children is such a good look on you!
1211 2018-08-02 21:23:15 #pnpcbc the AB minister, brags about her economic numbers leading the nation, but forgets the price of oil accounts for all of it!
1212 2018-08-02 21:23:11 < "Now we'll also need oil." Yes, that made it even more healthy, didn't it? Julchen embraced the new atmosphere as it came, highly preferring their joking and pretending over the image of Ivan begging her to stay and Julchen yelling at her.
1213 2018-08-02 21:23:04 alienated oil heater makes you blitzed
1214 2018-08-02 21:22:55 you should try suave oil infusion shampoo and conditioner. it helps damaged and dry hair.
1215 2018-08-02 21:22:42 omg tysm mommy akala ko 0 na kami sa tle eh buti nalan nahanap nya 24 oil pastels ko huhu
1216 2018-08-02 21:22:19 I'm about to get like my grandparents and start anointing people with oil. The devil can't have my family
1217 2018-08-02 21:22:16 This will destroy our entire economy, the Deep water Horizon oil spill destroyed our economy and it didn't even affect the water by me. We must stop this,
1218 2018-08-02 21:22:11 No summercamp for you? There are some babies that could use your company.
1219 2018-08-02 21:22:08 We have olive oil
1220 2018-08-02 21:21:51 Wait.. your an oil portrait artist  I would like to apply for the chauffeur position that just opened.
1221 2018-08-02 21:21:48 Everytime my dad changes the oil in my mom's car he writes "I <3 u" on the sticker and honestly it's the cutest thing ever
1222 2018-08-02 21:21:16 Replacing Lib-Cons with Lib-Cons isn’t really change. Big Oil is still in command while the earth burns.
1223 2018-08-02 21:21:00 Seul @MonPetitGazon peut résoudre cette affaire
1224 2018-08-02 21:20:58 No more or less so than ppl that turned out for Hope and Change. If Establishment means it's good enough for thee but not for me, yes there is a rebellion.  Swamp message resonates
1225 2018-08-02 21:20:44 He already is. Today he’s working on rolling back Obama’s regs on fuel economy. Without those regs,  not only will our environment be harmed and consumers use more gas, but who else thinks it might have to do with Russian oil? I do.
1226 2018-08-02 21:20:42 Hmm. This could be VERY interesting...

Or VERY horrifying. Depending on how they play it.
1227 2018-08-02 21:20:35 And we're not replacing one monopoly with another - capital is not a monopoly, because more capital can always be produce. There is no fixed quantity of labor. But there is a fixed quantity of land, oil, and to some extent patents.
1228 2018-08-02 21:20:34 Some of them have beneficial effects, I use Rosemary, lavender, time oil to help with scalp and hair health. But the people claiming they cure cancers or behavioral problems.... No.

1232 2018-08-02 21:19:43 imagine you need to remember the guy that invented peanut oil while you’re trying to bust a fat one. that’s why
1233 2018-08-02 21:19:43 Mashwest is still in a pot somewhere  simmering after a lovely recipe that included cinnamon , garlic and olive oil
1234 2018-08-02 21:19:40 Thank you very much for letting us know. Hope you are OK? And thanks for picking up the glass too. We'll have someone head that way to clean up that "oil spill". :)
1235 2018-08-02 21:19:32 Then this symphony you are directing must be like manna from Heaven for you. If only it didn't come at the cost of your soul to hear it.

1237 2018-08-02 21:19:30 I have another recipe with sausages ..
Sausages
Cream
Canned chipotle peppers
Canned mushrooms
Blend the peppers as spicy as you want with the cream, salt and pepper. Cook the sausages with a little olive oil. add the mushrooms without the liquid.and the sauce. let it cook.
1238 2018-08-02 21:19:17 GERS doesn't account for an iScot making its own spending choices. Really? C'mon! This has been done to death for 4 yrs now! You even have experts come out & say its shit!  
An oil rich land is piss poor? Really?
Can you point me to another one in the world?
1239 2018-08-02 21:19:14 my oil change took 2 hours once and they said they were just gonna wash it real quick, which lasted another hour 
1240 2018-08-02 21:19:00 Oil is over there's a Sneaky one on Henry Street with Jacuzzis I've heard

1242 2018-08-02 21:18:36 You’re welcome. Good for you guys. Great cause. Good luck.
1243 2018-08-02 21:18:34 None. You use palm oil. Palm oil companies are slashing and burning rain forests and killing exotic endangered animals and negatively affecting the climate. Eating a snickers bar is the same as killing an orangutan. Stop using palm oil. #PalmOilKills #ClimateChangeIsReal
1244 2018-08-02 21:18:25 I’m never gonna make it to get an oil change
1245 2018-08-02 21:18:16 Melodies of life, a final fantasy theme song.
1246 2018-08-02 21:18:13 The media has failed to report on anything that would paint corporations and banks and oil companies in an accurate light because the media relies on these industries for their advertising revenues. The media totally ignored Flint, Michigan - a water crisis right here in the U.S.
1247 2018-08-02 21:18:13 And OMG yes I tweeted it from the wrong account, @joshpenryUSA, which you can tell because it says “I.” I get you’re sore about the fact that your oil and gas “rally” was a bunch of employees on the clock, i.e. astroturf. It is what it is. #copolitics
1248 2018-08-02 21:18:10 @ChuysRestaurant what oil are your chicken fajitas grilled in?
1249 2018-08-02 21:18:00 LMAOOOO RIGHT i do a warm compress w lavender essential oil every night on my face and it’s great for my skin but bc it’s like, so close to my nose it keeps me awake and i’m FRUSTRATED
1250 2018-08-02 21:17:57 Wait like hot chili oil or the Szechuan peppercorns that make your face go numb

1254 2018-08-02 21:17:28 Gotta pay a car note, car registration, car insurance, buy gas, get oil changes, wash the car, detail the car.. bruh driving is overrated.
1255 2018-08-02 21:17:17 Medical marijuana can help so much and a major reason why it’s not universally accepted is because Big Pharma won’t allow it. If we all switched over to natural CBD oil instead of lab grown pills, who loses out? Pill makers.
1256 2018-08-02 21:17:13 Is she drinking the oil that they use before they start cooking the food?
1257 2018-08-02 21:17:13 Socialism leads to misery? Because it feels like capitalism is the one that lead to poverty wages, the least-efficient / most expensive health care system, for-profit prisons, and rolling back air standards to fatten oil execs pockets. @davidharsanyi
1258 2018-08-02 21:17:06 Why is there something wrong with my car every time I get an oil change ..?
1259 2018-08-02 21:16:43  and I had to drink castor oil in the morning so they could come out easily 
1260 2018-08-02 21:16:26 $qep & $crc are both 5x EV/ebitda.  That ain’t expensive if oil stays here for a couple of years.
1261 2018-08-02 21:16:13 -2 renegotiate trade deals to strengthen the US, didn’t begin training programs for our citizens to develop needed skills, made it harder to open new oil wells and become more energy independent, allowed manufacturing to die out, didn’t lower taxes, didn’t try to stop businesses
1262 2018-08-02 21:16:12 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet revisit them.

1266 2018-08-02 21:15:57 Ha, it is a cookie ..A digestive biscuit is a type of cookie, or biscuit as they are called in the UK, made with coarse wheat flour, ground wholemeal, a light amount of sugar, & a rising agent, along with oil, salt, & sometimes milk as well. The result is a slightly savory cookie
1267 2018-08-02 21:15:53 These fucking $75 oil changes so annoying
1268 2018-08-02 21:15:50 funny, i never even heard of it. even though i'm into nuclear and oil.

1272 2018-08-02 21:15:30 If this #LagosIbadanRail is eventually completed in less than two years then we may need to ask questions on why the Abuja-Kaduna railway was not completed in five years despite high oil prices.
1273 2018-08-02 21:15:29 Oil dey ur head
1274 2018-08-02 21:15:29 Fortunately, this is one area where smart citizens can counteract bad gov’t. I drive my Chevy Bolt  up & down the 48th district every day. 200-300 mile range and HOV access. I highly recommend it. Time to put big oil in its place. #FlipThe48th

1279 2018-08-02 21:14:49 Got an oil change and new tires. A bitch is broke
1280 2018-08-02 21:14:39 @dvd_oil thank you 
1281 2018-08-02 21:14:29 Try cooking kale with some diced garlic, olive oil and Greek seasoning. That’s how I eat it and it’s literally heaven on earth. It’s not as healthy for you but you still get the same nutrients from the kale!
1282 2018-08-02 21:14:08 i cant tell if my moisturizer hasnt fully dried yet or im just producing a film of oil on my face i hate this
1283 2018-08-02 21:14:04 I keep needing to eat food but I keep doing things..... Capricorn oil blend backfire! 
1284 2018-08-02 21:13:47 Asshat driver. He’ll learn his lesson in one hell of an unfortunate way someday. Hope your arm doesn’t bruise :/ (If it does, coconut oil. I bruise really easy & swear by it)
1285 2018-08-02 21:13:34 eh plus I'm running out of anointing oil
1286 2018-08-02 21:13:13 gave sis a nice bath, washed her hair and put coconut oil in it. She smells so good

1292 2018-08-02 21:12:50 Dollar is backed by guns & oil.  Ethereum is backed by security tokens + guns if needed  .   Vitalik would be the government’s bet.  Governments like things they can control.  Bitcoin is uncontrollable, so governments counter balance would be Ethereum.

1294 2018-08-02 21:12:34 Yes. Someone else's fault. Again. Poor little socialists. Just a massive oil reserve to live off. Must be hard.

1297 2018-08-02 21:11:58 I mean, even the common person really couldn’t purchase a Model T bc of all the maintenance and upkeep going into it cost more than the car. 

In a way, he’s zoomed past Ford bc he’s throttling a 100 year old oil based industry into making it the norm to drive electric vehicles

1312 2018-08-02 21:10:37 Hi, @calgarytransit, the plastic bag I had a glass bottle of olive oil in broke on my feet over the south platform at City Hall station. Some other people and I picked up the glass shards, but there is 700 ml of olive oil on the platform. I'm so sorry.
1313 2018-08-02 21:10:31 Please provide evidence that you are NOT under the control of SUGAR, OIL, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, CHEMICAL COMPANIES, AND CABLE TV?  Otherwise, there is a common assumption that you are bought off.

1. Prevent an imminent war with Iran that would disrupt oil supplies,
2. Destroy Daesh and contain remaining terrorists in Idlib.
3. Unite against waging economic warfare through sanctions and tariffs.
4. Encourage political dialog between all parties.

1340 2018-08-02 21:08:01 Renewable energy is fine, forcibly shutting down the oil and gas energy in Colorado is not ok.  Besides natural gas is a clean energy and already Xcel energy is converting their power plants to nat gas and increasing renewable to supplement.
1341 2018-08-02 21:08:00 Wasn't rising oil prices the end goal anyway for Trump?

1347 2018-08-02 21:07:32 Agreed, though not everyone has the time and energy to go to the Asian market for, say, a bottle of sesame oil.

1352 2018-08-02 21:06:56 Do they have oil wells in the north where they can extract crude or are they going to lay pipes in order to channel crude from Niger delta to the said refinery. For me this APC lead government is clueless.

1354 2018-08-02 21:06:32 What exactly did @jkenney accomplish for Alberta's oil and gas sector? He failed to get a pipeline built to tidewater. He taxed income trusts. And—he attempted to sabotage a $15.1 billion energy deal. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

1365 2018-08-02 21:04:39 Do you mean CBD oil?
1366 2018-08-02 21:04:34 There’s a plan. To make oil money for the Russians.
1367 2018-08-02 21:04:34 Russia is, basically, a well-armed gas station. Without high profits from the sale of oil and natural gas, Russia’s economy is nothing. Trump went right for Russia’s jugular. He said overly nice things to Putin Helsinki, Washington through his EU deal, stomped on Russia’s throat

1373 2018-08-02 21:03:01 Yeah I didn’t read the piece but I’ve read the feedback —that it manages to collectivize blame and put leftists on same footing as republicans, capitalists, oil & gas co’s!
1374 2018-08-02 21:02:55 We hear talk about this or that curse ie oil curse. I see an election curse on the continent. Either those in leadership are vote thieves or the electorates are fanatics who can't accept results any other way.
1375 2018-08-02 21:02:53 Considering I work for a Dealership, not usually. Usually s reman engine comes sans oil pump pick-up. If this came complete, with oil pan installed, I would say the rebuilder is at fault.
1376 2018-08-02 21:02:41 It's already greasy enough. 

....He already wasted a ton of oil-

"Hell no."
1377 2018-08-02 21:02:28 I would be embarrassed of @realDonaldTrump if he did the following;
1) Gave 150billion to a Govt that calls for our destruction
2) Overthrow Gaddafi for French oil companies
3) Abandon US ambassador & staff, then blame a YouTube video
4) used FBI to spy on opponent

We have upped our Oil exportation = very bad for Russia as well as our Natural gas production again very bad for Russia so please explain the Problem
1381 2018-08-02 21:01:52 ...if what is going on is price volatility of a few goods rather than a rise in economy wide prices, it may be the case that true real wages actually have risen - but at the same time people got screwed by oil supply issues.
1382 2018-08-02 21:01:46 So now we know she was looking for that cooking oil..
1383 2018-08-02 21:01:43 @realDonaldTrump is illegitimate.  He wants a war with Iran to steal its oil. #TraitorTrump
1384 2018-08-02 21:01:22 Great article. I was shunned by a bunch of in-laws for saying that the magnet thing they were trying to get me to buy into was "snake oil."
1385 2018-08-02 21:01:21 I have no problem either spending good money on quality makeup. I'm still looking for something that will keep my face from turning into an oil slick. Probably won't happen, but I keep looking. 
1386 2018-08-02 21:01:21 Latest oil numbers: Iran's crude exports stayed steady in July (2.228m bpd); Chinese and Indian imports increased to multi-year highs, while Korea pulled plug on both crude and condensate imports (Seoul was #1 condensate importer).
1387 2018-08-02 21:01:19 I need to get an oil change ASAP. My car is running through gas

1398 2018-08-02 21:00:06 If you all slap more tariffs on Canada, especially on cars, Canada will only be able to do retaliatory tariffs on the 5 million barrels of oil you by from us every day.  Then when you pay double per gallon for gas, you can talk about 'fair", but maybe that's your plan.
1399 2018-08-02 21:00:00 That usually recommend mineral oil for wooden bowl people use for food. But I don't know if that would be good for that cage or not.

1428 2018-08-02 20:56:04 @Walmart Why would a Wal Mart have lanes for oil changes and not use them but make the customers park in the parking lot and go inside, usually if you see the lines in the lanes you know how much time its going to take but like this you have no clue...just wasted my time.

1437 2018-08-02 20:55:08 Bloomberg reports , Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Pricing as It Boosts Supply to  Meet Demand.  Why Saudi does not say they need money and they have no  buyer for their oil,  so they increase the production and decrease the  price,
1438 2018-08-02 20:55:07 Just go out buy12 candle sticks , olive oil, garlic, a pack of mustard seeds and start your spiritual cleansing
1439 2018-08-02 20:55:06 They taste really if you put them in a separate marinade and then heat oil in the pan (or wok) hot enough that water droplets sizzle on contact and then introduce the mushrooms. (The heat is important b/c otherwise the oil gets absorbed into whatever you’re cooking.)
1440 2018-08-02 20:54:57 $2.6 Billion sent from US to Mexico in October, 2017 Alone!  Remittences outpace oil exports as income to Mexico.  @POTUS needs to get that tax in place.  BOOM, wall paid for.

1445 2018-08-02 20:54:21 If we don't get more investment then oil will not be 56 in 3 years, barring a deep recession. Shales can not fill the gap 3 more years.

Forgot I put oil in the frying pan to heat about 20 mins ago. Came back & the oil is smoking .
Whole place smell like smoke now 
1450 2018-08-02 20:53:47 A move to benefit big oil and literally no one else. California is on fire, flames licking the sides of my friends neighborhoods, the east coast is drowning. My god this admin will be the end of us all.

1460 2018-08-02 20:52:48 That one I'm less averse to because at least people know Oil King for The Legs(TM).  Nobody is looking at Mena like "Hey you see those Khakis he got on today?"
1461 2018-08-02 20:52:42 There are non-fish oil alternatives.
1462 2018-08-02 20:52:40 Don’t really have one but honeyxbrown sugar and olive oil or products from Teivaskincare

1481 2018-08-02 20:50:33 Venezuela focused on oil, they had no other big things. We destroyed them with sanctions. Right wing politics made a bigger mess by corruption.
1482 2018-08-02 20:50:32 Yes!  Especially stay away from the ones they put in oil though.
1483 2018-08-02 20:50:25 BISH ONE OF MY EARPHONWS FALL IN OIL AND NOW THE AMOUNT OF SOUND IS LOWER AT ONE EAR @ GOD WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME 
1484 2018-08-02 20:50:23 You might want something like our 25% Pure Gold Oil. This oil is highly concentrated, and is made without fillers. Depending on the cancer, other products might help. I'm getting suppositories for my father-in-law's prostate cancer. Stay strong
1485 2018-08-02 20:50:20 trump in an effort to help the oil industry increase volume $ by a few billion dollars in consumer usage by lowering the EPA standards while increasing emissions creating health hazards & shorten the life of the planet we live on again have CUT THE PRICE on your WORTH !$!$!
1486 2018-08-02 20:50:20 The British didn't yet have bombers capable of attacking the oil fields and in '41-2 the RAF's accuracy over Germany had been so demonstrably poor that should they attack Poletsi they would cause little damage so was of little concern to OKW.

1493 2018-08-02 20:49:32 Honestly. I'm with Kui on this one. I remember when we were still gearing up for Capcom Cup I was rooting for Oil King to win just so we could see some short short short ass shorts on Rashid, lol.

1500 2018-08-02 20:48:44 What’s scary is that there’s enough oil in the Junior Don’s hair that he could easily catch fire if he’s anywhere near the Senior Don’s pants. 
1501 2018-08-02 20:48:43 Issa, once again you demonstrate how clueless and delusional you have become. So - you now want the fossil fuel lobbyists taking direction from the oil industry to set our standards? And - “climate change” is a hoax? Shame on you....

1523 2018-08-02 20:46:17 Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what good it does. Another close friend that I grew up with in the South currently works in oil and gas development - because the money is good, he has kids, and it's what he knows how to do. He's also a vocal and concerned climate activist.

1532 2018-08-02 20:45:15 @realDonaldTrump, Why not invent a disease that lowers taxes, and eliminates social programs? Call it AIDS 2: Wrath of GOD...maybe put some Viagra in it this time to help oil the track.

1543 2018-08-02 20:43:32 Nice rant. I was just telling someone “do not buy the snake oil” coincidentally.
1544 2018-08-02 20:43:26 Aus importing refined fuels  diesel gasoline from places like China and Sth Korea which import oil from places like Russia and Iran.  We don't have 90 days fuel reserves like US Strategic Petroleum reserve in Louisiana.  So it makes sense to shift our demand to our own energy
1545 2018-08-02 20:43:18 The only thing truly "tinpot" about this game is the Burnley pitchside ads sounding like made up sponsors from FIFA career mode. 

"LaBa360"
"Barnfield Construction"
"Crown Oil"
"Golf Clash"

Not exactly Gazprom is it.
1546 2018-08-02 20:43:12 The Only oil some people have is the oil the they were anointed with which doesn't make or qualify you to be anointed but the real oil is what God deposited in YOU! Which came by relationship not rituals! #JLBM

1549 2018-08-02 20:42:59 Hey media, if you're not the enemy of the people, tell the people where all their money goes. Tell them about all their wasted productivity. Or tell the people how the oil industry and the banking industry and investment firms are the people's friend.
1550 2018-08-02 20:42:56 Is she just downing straight oil? I’m confused lol
1551 2018-08-02 20:42:53 wash your piercings 2-3 times a day and massage tea tree oil into them for at least two weeks til they go away

1553 2018-08-02 20:42:27 Actually, that's an oil spill.
1554 2018-08-02 20:42:08 If you need a moisturizer that's NOT oil based, try our hyperpigment face cream. It's made with seabuckthorn oil, teatree oil, carrotseed oil and more. The texture is a gel like consistency which absorbs right into your skin within a few seconds. Apply the bruja potion after

1556 2018-08-02 20:41:52 Washing your hair everyday removes the oils from your hair daily which causes your glands to produce more oil, because your body thinks it needs more oil when you wash it all away. You can “train” your scalp to produce less oil by only waning your hair every couple of days.

1577 2018-08-02 20:39:55 Neem oil is still a chemical. It is also not currently registered for use on crops plants in Canada. Tweets like this are misleading and do a disservice to our scientific risk-based regulatory system for pesticides in Canada.

1599 2018-08-02 20:37:23 But we get 96% of the oil.  Well, that’s the story being sold, although what Shetland’ll think is anyone’s guess.  

But back to having 96% of the oil resource - anyone able to translate what this impressive figure means in actual Green - do we need a bigger bag for the dosh ?
1600 2018-08-02 20:37:17 I unabashedly just ate half a pint of @TallutosPasta cheeseballs and then dipped garlic bread in all the oil. I think it was about 14 cheeseballs. Living my best life!

1621 2018-08-02 20:34:59 As if our market is free. Big corporations will suppress anything they don't like. e.g. The modern solar cell was invented in 1941.

1701 2018-08-02 20:25:29 Ships should be solar powered by now.  Fossil fuels are killing our entire planet: water, sea life, air, aquifers, farm land and human life.The fair compromise is: use oil, abide by environmental laws protecting sea life. You can't have it all, ya greedy bastards.
1702 2018-08-02 20:25:25 Omg. I hope Will is also your bf. If that is the case, then yes- you’re life is pretty great because you get to celebrate Oktoberfest with Will. Lol

1704 2018-08-02 20:25:11 Is it true that PM Abiy said that only 7% or a small percentage of the oil in the Somali Region benefits/profits/ownership is for Somalis? #Ethiopia 
1705 2018-08-02 20:25:05 Ever noticed how quickly AJ gets his own Oil Business set up in Armageddon?? It's like a day and half after he got fired?? 
1706 2018-08-02 20:25:02 Hahah... try adding it to some food and cooking with it. Need oil + heat to relese its best benefits
1707 2018-08-02 20:25:01 a lot of the 1% and oil we're not.
1708 2018-08-02 20:24:58 @realDonaldTrump is out for oil execs instead of middle class Americans by trying to raise gas prices by increasing fuel standards @cnn @foxnews @msnbc @timryan @moveon @TheYoungTurks @nytimes

1711 2018-08-02 20:24:44 The thing is, I’m 90% sure this stupid thing wasn’t leaking oil. GUESS IT WAS.
1712 2018-08-02 20:24:42 You have abolish ice in your bio, maybe you should sit this one out and go back to giving Trump, and apparently Natalie, free rent in your head.
1713 2018-08-02 20:24:31 It’s probably sesame oil, that’s what they use at Hibachi style grill restaurants
1714 2018-08-02 20:24:25 Cut them in halves and bake them on 400° for 20min with olive oil, chopped garlic, salt and pepper. Then broil for 5min  thats my fav
1715 2018-08-02 20:24:16 Coconut oil and a good conditioner 
1716 2018-08-02 20:24:14 Amen. I've stopped wearing foundation altogether and love it. My complexion isn't quite as great yet but I've bought something called glow tonic from pixi and I can see a difference. I might have to try this oil you mention too 
1717 2018-08-02 20:24:12 Science worked hand in hand with Big Oil companies for 133 years.
It seems like this problem could have been avoided if the same SCIENCE that is pushing for a carbon tax would have refused to work with oil companies in the first place.  placing all the blame on the public is lame
1718 2018-08-02 20:24:02 @HemiGod426 hey happened to run across and aaw the hemi reference.  I installed a rebuilt 5.7 in my buddies magnum. Everything was perfect.  After a few hundred miles he said the oil light came on and off several times.  He brought the car to my house and it appears ...1/2

1720 2018-08-02 20:23:52 Guess which genius managed to accidentally splash hot oil on herself dishing up dinner and now has a burn mark on her chin and forearm?
1721 2018-08-02 20:23:47 Oven BC I don't trust myself with boiling oil

I did not, I think it's more fun to rip them apart and also didn't want to do that to raw chicken but this is something to think about when I next do them
1722 2018-08-02 20:23:16 Why are we all assuming that’s liquor? If that’s a hibachi style grill then that means it could be sesame oil. I have so many questions 
1723 2018-08-02 20:23:15 You taught me to utilize the toilet seat covers as oil absorbers whenever I felt shiny 
1724 2018-08-02 20:23:10 I try to stick to comments about science but this heresy must be challenged. Are you going to attack patchouli oil next?
1725 2018-08-02 20:23:08 Just mind coconut oil is really unhealthy, but aye that'll work
1726 2018-08-02 20:23:02 Another comment on fuel standards. A Corvette with a 500hp V8 engine can get up to 25mpg. It would be pretty easy for standard sedans and economy cars to get 50 or 100mpg. Don't believe the auto industry if they say it's hard to do. They must be controlled by the oil industry.
1727 2018-08-02 20:23:02 They cooked egg fried rice without using sesame oil? What the feck is wrong with these people? #eatwellforless

1740 2018-08-02 20:21:01 Like first of all, why would i be ungrateful about something your “SUPPOSED” to do  If you not working, yes you go change my oil, yes you go buy me some tires, etc etc. If you my man, that’s your job ! Especially if you don’t have a job & be asking for these keys

1747 2018-08-02 20:19:48 The first ipcc report was in 1988, it was pretty much public in the 80s.  The idea that oil companies are supposed to reinvent themselves based on arrenhius' prediction when just 10 years previous it was ice age redux is silly.

1758 2018-08-02 20:18:23 Indeed. No regime can survive without a social contract betw rulers & the ruled. While in democracies social contract is through free elections, in autocracies like Iran, the gov buys the loyalty of a segment of population with oil wealth. In Iran this social contract is eroding

1780 2018-08-02 20:15:58 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
1781 2018-08-02 20:15:44 Really bothers me how the body coach films himself cooking his meals. Is there any need to fling ur coconut oil at the pan from 3 metres away? Use both hands u nonce and stop throwing noodles about
1782 2018-08-02 20:15:43 They want our produce, our fish and our water long term - they have the oil already
1783 2018-08-02 20:15:41 @myvirginkitchen I see you do a lot of frying.. how do you dispose of all the oil? Do you reuse it? I never tried frying stuff other than in the pan because I had no idea of what to do with all the oil...
1784 2018-08-02 20:15:11 My scalp is SO dry. Like no matter how much oil I put in it. The next day it feels like I haven’t put anything in it.
1785 2018-08-02 20:15:10 Oil change, buying birthday gifts, today was expensive
1786 2018-08-02 20:15:08 Babe I was in the same boat castor oil will save your hair !
1787 2018-08-02 20:15:00 Cool. Because I’m just waiting for the @nytimes to make it political so they can use it as a shield.
1788 2018-08-02 20:14:57 I’m siding with any entity that forces the oil and gas industry to be responsible citizens — including lawsuits.
1789 2018-08-02 20:14:54 Also I think China is selling Gold (to Russia?), to maintain the XAUCNY peg between 8200-8360; as they cannot afford the CNY to drop against XAU, as CNY is interchangeable for Gold for those buying Yuan Denominated Oil Contracts.
1790 2018-08-02 20:14:54 .@RosneftEN  and @GrupaLOTOS signed an #oil supply contract to Poland.

1792 2018-08-02 20:14:37 I literally need just one gram of oil, Chicago
1793 2018-08-02 20:14:36 These cramps are still kicking my ass & I have no medicine or oil fuuuuuuck 
1794 2018-08-02 20:14:30 Mox dry ingredients together; beat eggs with oil; melt choc; stir all in. Bake. I find a shallow tin works best and an icing made of melted choc with a chunk of butter and a dollop of golden syrup is good.
You can substitute bananas when your courgettes run out. 
1795 2018-08-02 20:14:24 bake it individually and make chips with a drizzle of olive oil with sea salt and/or other seasonings. So simple and actually good imo.

1799 2018-08-02 20:14:02 No, because then you end up with baby oil, and that just ruins ANY dish.

1812 2018-08-02 20:12:16 WHY in Illinois can't I buy "legally" cannabis oil to help me live with COPD.  Cannibis oil "dilates" the brochial tubes allowing more air to pass through.  This oil also greatly reduces the infections that copd causes in the lungs.  Why Can't I buy this legally !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1813 2018-08-02 20:12:12 Comment on fuel standards. Most of the money spent on gas is just wasted, it is removed from the economy. It doesn't even go to the treasury to be put back into the economy. Do you want bigger skyscrapers in the middle-east or the money to go to oil companies that just sit on it?
1814 2018-08-02 20:12:07 how's that cbd oil on your guys store btw? think i'm going to buy a bottle
1815 2018-08-02 20:12:03 The fabric of society is falling apart under the pressure of continued lies about everything. The sad thing is the elite have technology to change everything for the better but they refuse to share it. They want to burn all the oil and cash in first. Greed is sick.
1816 2018-08-02 20:12:00 biotin!!! use a few drops of rosemary essential oil in a hair mask or add it into your shampoo and conditioner, horsetail/silica is rlly good too

1822 2018-08-02 20:11:09 Innovation and advancement has to be there for the masses and nothing will be complete until we’re off the oil model entirely. Figure out how to fuel vehicles off of all the corn, rice and wheat the government has been supplementing these farmers for years in and put it to use.
1823 2018-08-02 20:11:03 Especially when it's chocolate courgette cake: 6oz good plain choc, 7oz plain flour, 1tsp BP, 1/2tsp bicarb, 1/2tsp salt, 4oz caster sugar, 2 L eggs, 6fl.oz veg oil, 8oz grated courgettes, 2oz walnuts (optional).

1838 2018-08-02 20:08:24 Sadly David it appears from Tweets that many misty-eyed Scots who want to destroy the union really believe that they pay for much of the economy in England. Did you know that we cannot live without their taxes, electricity and oil? Do they know they've only two million taxpayers.

1842 2018-08-02 20:08:06 She’s right though. Things that are technically vegan like palm oil do SO MUCH more harm than a tablespoon of milk. Y’all need to calm the fuck down. How do you expect ANYONE to try veganism when you’re this harsh? Labels are just labels they don’t mean much compared to action
1843 2018-08-02 20:07:52 There are certainly enough assholes in Texas to elect Ted Cruz. They get their marching orders for the oil and gas industry, phony, coiffed haired preachers, and of course the extensive legions of American fascists including the current Governor. "Texas, a whole nother country."
1844 2018-08-02 20:07:42 How much in Bitcoin, gold or oil?

1847 2018-08-02 20:07:27 is that double purple parallel line strong? spx held but oil had an overthow....oil technically is back in your wedge or above, mentioned in earlier messages - guess it we wait to see if oil falls back out.

1851 2018-08-02 20:07:03 J35 and her dead calf is the most palpable connected earth grief I have ever experienced. I feel her pain everywhere around me throughout the day. Even without an oil spill, the tanker traffic affecting their fishing ability I feel may be the final nail.
1852 2018-08-02 20:06:44 Wolf caller, snake oil salesman, and conspiracy theorist aside, not paying this defamation money proves you are a coward and do not take responsibility for your actions, and like a baby you tweet about it.
1853 2018-08-02 20:06:44 in court i wanted a fence and a sign saying no children and to write notes to all the police and sheriff dept to follow me in my campaigne to save children from getting on a oil feild tanks didnt get it and the little boy struk a lighter and killed his 3 friends.

1859 2018-08-02 20:05:52 Every CEO of oil, gas and automakers knows that climate change is real . They have a moral obligation to the people of the world to reject trumps lifting of the fuel and mpg standards. By not they are literally killing people @Ford @GM @Toyota

1861 2018-08-02 20:05:34 because she doesn’t know how to wear shirts, JOSEY. and if that means she has any kind of oil nearby, then guess what?! She’s gonna wear it.
1862 2018-08-02 20:05:32 I don't think he's fake..This man talks about the politics behind English medicine and pharmaceutical corporations..Just like oil,u won't hear about alternative energy source unless oil is depleted completely..I don't believe no one in earth has an alternative for petrol by now..

1865 2018-08-02 20:05:12 vous saviez que le gasoil c’est juste gas + huile (oil)? Jme sens stupide
1866 2018-08-02 20:05:05 Why do you oil me?

1869 2018-08-02 20:04:41 Alaska has proved to be a very valuable purchase for the United States as it is rich in oil and natural gas. A full 25% of all the oil produced in the US comes from the state.

1872 2018-08-02 20:04:01 My money's on 'no,' at least in grid-tied. The only tech standards I can think of in history of any inf. are based in physics/chemistry (see: oil). Absent a fund. advance in storage akin to fusion, simply too many ways to skin that cat for any one to dominate & build moat.
1873 2018-08-02 20:03:57 So what are your solutions to take on the Oil Companies and win?
1874 2018-08-02 20:03:54 Wealth transfer in blns from Alberta and Saskatchewan to the USA due to Liberal oil patch pipeline loathing AND previous poor Conservative AB and Fed lethargy on building during the good times. Both are to blame.
1875 2018-08-02 20:03:32 Yes, I add drops of essential oils to fractionated coconut oil

1885 2018-08-02 20:02:17 Are there any reasonably priced suppliers in the UK for CDT oil? @psychicsisters you mentioned that you might be able to help. It works well along with my ADHD medication.
1886 2018-08-02 20:02:14 Cocoa butter Vaseline mixed with Vitamin E oil is such a blessing. That’s the onlyyyyy moisturizer i use on my face.
1887 2018-08-02 20:02:12 The first fords ran on vegetable oil and there were many models of electric cars in the early 1900's. They were more durable back then The price really is out of control for new autos. I can get a great restored classic for 20 - 25k with modern tech in it.

It's a bit like palm oil, which is everywhere, counterpoised with the destruction of the orangutan's homes.
1890 2018-08-02 20:01:49 - do your eyebrows 
- make a sugar lip scrub 
- to keep your lips smooth: use coconut oil and warm water on your lips
1891 2018-08-02 20:01:49 also, 
if Obama & a Democrat Majority Congress
couldn't take on the oil companies and win with climate change,
why would you expect Trump to do so?
Why does everyone act like getting the oil companies 
to change is just some easy thing to do?
1892 2018-08-02 20:01:46 The closest I get to a car wash is when I get my oil changed and they clean my windows
1893 2018-08-02 20:01:40 am I discriminatory? no 

do I hesitate to trust women who don’t own coconut oil? 100%
1894 2018-08-02 20:01:37 The only essential oil I use is Extra-Virgin Olive
1895 2018-08-02 20:01:37 @HellmannsUK Have you stopped manufacturing the Olive Oil Mayonnaise as we can no longer find it in most of the Cambridge supermarkets?
1896 2018-08-02 20:01:12 lol.   Adults find a replacement income before quitting a job.  If you were so concerned about getting off of selling oil to other countries then start promoting an alternative income source. Until then oil pays for your life in Canada until we make enough from something else.
1897 2018-08-02 20:00:51 Probably all be dead due to wars for oil and the pollution it pisses!
1898 2018-08-02 20:00:46 How did the British government spend their oil wealth? Nuclear missiles and wars.

1913 2018-08-02 19:57:58 IPCC founded in 1988, and it wasn't until their assessment reports in the 90s that strong scientific consensus was established. But Big Oil founded the Global Climate Coalition in 1989 to question the science and oppose any policy action.
1914 2018-08-02 19:57:45 background looks like they’re at a hibachi restaurant so i’m assuming that’s straight cooking oil...i’m scared
1915 2018-08-02 19:57:42 What's the US doing? Nothing POSITIVE. CREATING even MORE HOMELESSNESS for beleaguered and suffering Syrians simply because their nation is RICH with the OIL US LUSTS after.
1916 2018-08-02 19:57:37 fyi don’t use any type of essential oil diffuser if you have pets!!!!! all of them are toxic to animals
1917 2018-08-02 19:57:29 You couldn’t be the environment minister anyway; you accept scientific evidence supporting climate change and would take a strong stance on it. Oil companies would assassinate you, and then match days wouldn’t be the same.

1921 2018-08-02 19:56:56 You think oil and gas employees equate to astroturfing? That's astounding. #copolitics
1922 2018-08-02 19:56:51 @John_M_Nelson. Most oil-based inks use vegetable oils (soy, linseed, sometimes flax). So cleaning with veggie oil basically just keeps thinning down until you can wipe away all of the pigment. Works well. Otherwise white (low odor) kerosene is the way to go.
1923 2018-08-02 19:56:46 His man boobs are coming in nicely. Maybe he gets the oil for his hair from that restaurant.

1926 2018-08-02 19:56:42 That's good, we all need our area of expertise so we can establish a multilateral trading system once it all goes wrong. Luxury good such as gin and oil will set us apart from the common hawkers. The world will be ours!
1927 2018-08-02 19:56:42 Glucosamine and Fish oil are necessities
1928 2018-08-02 19:56:40 Good that you see your mistake now... 

But seriously : I'm not a hater. Please all you lemmings stop with this psychopath paranoia extremism stuff. You may be long or short a stock. That's how the system works. Nothing to do with Big Oil, hate, or conspiracies. Ridiculous.
1929 2018-08-02 19:56:28 Careful, some short sellers, non-competitors and oil company trolls will report that as anti-EV fact.  :(   Need a #sarcasm tag.  ;)

1939 2018-08-02 19:55:27 Oh I get what you need now. There should be some research on this somewhere. 

All the same Apple is the first *Tech* company to be valued at that. Some other coys(esp oil) have passed the market cap.
1940 2018-08-02 19:55:23 Get used to it and find another sector to work in. Oil production will only decline in the next 20+years.
1941 2018-08-02 19:55:18 Is it a flat tire or an oil leak? I can't tell from the picture.
1942 2018-08-02 19:55:12 Store Goals: finish internal damage sheet and store photo submission. Prep for IRV opening coming up soon, continue interviewing all applicants.

1949 2018-08-02 19:54:34 Kejri funding public schools/services in Delhi is akin to Hugo Chávez who funded his unsustainable social programs in Venezuela by eviscerating the PDVSA, Venezuela's oil company. First by replacing its best talent with political loyalists, next by siphoning out its wealth.

1951 2018-08-02 19:54:20 The US oil production will skyrocket when the bottlenecks can be fix in 2019 and 2020, then, the shale production in Texas and New Mexico will be unstoppable

1956 2018-08-02 19:53:53 $625 for 2 little black stickers on my plates and then a $75 oil change on top of that... growing up suuuuuucks.
1957 2018-08-02 19:53:53 I understood that and I've been a huge advocate of "safety", but recently it's been striking an off note to my ear.  Safety is not getting stabbed in the back while your burning the midnight oil to get work done. Safety doesn't mean being protected from business reality.
1958 2018-08-02 19:53:48 I just drove 3.5 hours to Southern NM. I wasn’t able to rent a car (how were there NO cars available, Burque?) so I got an oil change and the Champ aka Champion Lover aka my car and I hit the road. Her, me, music and the open road. We still got it.

1962 2018-08-02 19:53:24 The price of oil is going up because of increased demand and worldwide collusion in oil production.  Let's hope Alberta doesn't blow it all away, again.
1963 2018-08-02 19:53:22 You need better friends, oil and a weekend away with Mammon.

Besides auto makers making increased fuel efficiancy, they also are making the cars safer! Payment + gas cheaper overall. He’s protecting oil industry again.
1965 2018-08-02 19:53:17 Trump and Scott can't take all the blame...back in 2010...we activists told everyone about the toxicity of the GOM after the Gulf Oil Disaster...this is a culmination of all the toxic practices here in Florida over the course of many, many years. #flwatercrisis #toxic18

1970 2018-08-02 19:52:39 True story - one time there was an incident with jalapeño peppers and all the pepper oil was not off my partner’s hands. If you cook, be careful! And if this happens to you, pour milk on it.
1971 2018-08-02 19:52:35 Oil pulling is a life saver for your teeth, thank me later
1972 2018-08-02 19:52:24 guy: can you cook?

Girl who’s done no physical labor: can you change oil? Build cabinets? Can you cut the grass? Can you..

80% of men: Yes...
1973 2018-08-02 19:52:22 I member that from when I was a kid in the 70s and 80s.  If a gas station was posted 'full service', you'd expect them to fill up the gas, check the oil, wash the windshield and rear window.  I think about half to two thirds of the stations were full service?
1974 2018-08-02 19:52:18 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1975 2018-08-02 19:52:17 Use baby oil on the Lil butt women it enhances the visual effects
1976 2018-08-02 19:52:11 Actually it is very American to say that. It as just as American as saying the President is the enemy of the people or the IRS, or the FBI or Schumer or waters or the oil industry, some other public institution.  Quit your whining.
1977 2018-08-02 19:52:05 Stain and finishing oil on the glass weeping yeeeeaaaaboyyyyyyyy nice work cuzzy!

1979 2018-08-02 19:51:48 Would be nice if Indy could host a Wrestlemania again. Lucas Oil Stadium is a more than capable venue and the city is super bowl-worthy as well!
1980 2018-08-02 19:51:34 That's an important facet of Trump's success. He enables people to ignore the bounds of polite society & express their rage & resentment. He explicitly blew up "political correctness." He released a toxic tide of pent-up emotions, kinda like an oil spill. It's polluting r country

1982 2018-08-02 19:51:24 Walked by the river today and saw 11 fish, dead, just floating on the top. The river had oil in it last week, but it could also be the heat. All varieties of fish are actually mass-dying, all over the world, and noone's talking about it.

1983 2018-08-02 19:51:13 While I share this attitude, there are some cases where I wouldn't know what to expect going bad to look like. Like, we had some toum (that dip made almost entirely of raw garlic pureed in oil) in the fridge,
1984 2018-08-02 19:51:05 The other day i learned how to make vegan aiolis using tofu as an emulsifier & emulsifying with extra virgin olive oil . Super easy and super cool to make all types of vegan sauces including salad dressings .you can run any direction you want with the flavor to it’s easy !!
1985 2018-08-02 19:50:53 why i'm sitting next to a man thats MUSTY AS FUCK boy. omfg. I really had to put some perfume oil on me cuz boy.
1986 2018-08-02 19:50:47 It is  I didn't know that once upon a time oil was used on tracks to bind shale  That's what I learnt that was new although it doesn't happen anymore apparently.
1987 2018-08-02 19:50:43 Why can't EU decide? If you push someone beyond the limit, they will do anything. 

If China, EU and Russia, S Korea, Japan, India, Brazil decides to shift to EU, then that's it. End of story. They can start with oil trade.
1988 2018-08-02 19:50:40 Oil rigs everywhere! I can see it now!
1989 2018-08-02 19:50:27 It shows how ignorant some people are about where all their money comes from for public education, healthcare, welfare & too many other handouts. Canada sells oil so you can have free stuff.  Get off your naive virtue signaling butt & learn where your handouts come from.
1990 2018-08-02 19:50:24 Ugh. Chinese steel. Widely rejected by the oil industry due to it never meeting the standards they claim it does.
1991 2018-08-02 19:50:21 そこに進捗はあったか？いや，そこにあるのは虚無だけだ
1992 2018-08-02 19:50:02 شدحيلك
1993 2018-08-02 19:49:50 Pennsylvania is probably very ashamed of falling for a snake oil salesman. It ought to be. The paltry rebirth of steel will soon vanish like all your other hateful ideas. Maybe hatred itself will diminish with you firmly in the rear view mirror.
1994 2018-08-02 19:49:43 Day 4 = volume!!! No touch up today, just a butterfly clip to give my front a little pop!
It’s been a month & a half since my last color touchup & I’m already noticing dark edges & growth from weekly oil treatments.I’ll start doing them more often!
Are you growing your hair out??
1995 2018-08-02 19:49:42 use caster oil!
1996 2018-08-02 19:49:36 Incrementalism has already brought us a energy transition (from coal-based to oil/gas based) set up the welfare state, led to our digital economy, etc. Incrementalism doesn't mean go slow, it means work with what you have.
1997 2018-08-02 19:49:34 I hope Sean Hannity dies in an oil fire. I really do.
1998 2018-08-02 19:49:30 Venezuela's always pointed to with a cry of, "SOCIALISM HAS FAILED!" but actually the overwhelming majority of Venezuela's financial problems have been caused by a large drop in oil sales.
1999 2018-08-02 19:49:23 Because they’re more accessible public figures than most oil oligarchs and investment bankers ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2017 2018-08-02 19:48:13 Trump wants to kill fuel economy standards; killing more people and burning more gas. Trump allies will profit; big oil
2018 2018-08-02 19:48:06 Misplaced priorities allocate half of that money to Calabar and Port Harcourt ports and you won't have such gridlock on Apapa port,but ships move to port Harcourt to carry crude oil out of the country but ships can't come to port Harcourt to offload goods. #RescueNigeria

2022 2018-08-02 19:47:44 THE PARABLE OF THE COUNTRY 

And when the war ended, the victors sat down to share the spoils. One region got the oil wells and the other region got the foreign companies.

The vanquished region got two sets of gifts.
2023 2018-08-02 19:47:41 GUYS I THINK MY FINANCIAL CONTROLLER SAW ME AT THE ROCK CONCERT ON SATURDAY BECAUSE HE JUST ASKED ME IF I LIKED THE OIL WRESTLING JUST COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE AND THEY HAD WOMENS OIL WRESTLING THERE
2024 2018-08-02 19:47:31 You just have to take these pills I am taking which may or may not destroy your liver but it will remove all the oil from your body and preserve you like King Tut
2025 2018-08-02 19:47:28 Waiting on an oil change, may be just as hot inside as out. Better than doing it myself in this humidity today.
2026 2018-08-02 19:47:23 Giving a tax cut to vast majority is not reasonable? As pointed out tax burden doesnt change bcse of proportionality.  
Ppl that benefit most will be retirees and ppl holding fixed income low yield instruments.
2027 2018-08-02 19:47:14 At Tires Warehouse, van in for oil change, brake check and advice on your replacement ... I have been here before and received great service, so now I am back!

2031 2018-08-02 19:46:47 Have you tried CBD oil?
2032 2018-08-02 19:46:38 @AliVelshi 
Also steel tariffs add to costs of car and,as you all said, oil industry but aren't both those things on Russia's economic wish list?
2033 2018-08-02 19:46:32 The only reason Trump wants to rollback fuel efficiency is to increase future profits for big oil. He intends to at least prevent further declines in the use of gasoline by thrashing higher fuel efficiencies. We are now saving a million barrels of oil per day w/ higher standards.
2034 2018-08-02 19:46:32 Just in. “Spamming”.

2038 2018-08-02 19:45:49 Trump is rolling back fuel standards to where automakers will make more gas guzzling cars and this benefits oil companies.   What article did u read.  Take the Fox News glasses off
2039 2018-08-02 19:45:35 @shaunking is pure propaganda, a snake oil salesman.    I'm sorry but I have caught him in so many lies and intentional mistruths that now I don't believe ANYTHING he says.
2040 2018-08-02 19:45:21 You know the weathers back to normal when your coconut oil is solid.

2044 2018-08-02 19:44:08 Exactly this oil companies and foreign auto manufacturers are the only ones that benefit from trump trying to get rid of the EPA standards. Jobs will be lost from American carmakers

2046 2018-08-02 19:43:37 She did. Bought me a big fuck-off comb with teeth like a tiger's and a bottle of oil to comb through. I still do it. She was actually surprised my hair could take the same care/punishment she was inflicting on her daughter lol.
2047 2018-08-02 19:43:33 Today I explained to my Dad why a mineral oil cooled PC would be a tremendously terrible idea.

If only he spoke enough English that I could simply show him the LTT video series.
2048 2018-08-02 19:43:29 Looks like oil :D
2049 2018-08-02 19:43:27 Instant oil change places should offer you a discount based on how long you wait

2054 2018-08-02 19:42:33 Dandelion oil can help moisturize hair and soothe a dry, itchy scalp. If you have dry skin you can consider taking 360mg of borage seed oil daily.
2055 2018-08-02 19:42:30 Wonderful this country needs to be independent of Oil, Gas and Steel. We have all the resources why have we not been using them instead of making every one else rich?
2056 2018-08-02 19:42:16 I disagree with you as our foreign policy is a full frontal war policy for targeted countries. Those countries being lands of oil, mostly Muslim & not white. Tommy Robinson is everything which represents UK foreign policy, hence why he's promoted as veterans advocate.
2057 2018-08-02 19:41:45 If I your break your heart na Oil spillage.

2059 2018-08-02 19:41:26 Look up cleansing oil for my face on etsy. First hit is "unicorn smudging spray." First, this isn't even the kind of cleansing I'm searching for. Second, SSSSSSSSSSSTOP I'M SO TIRED. JUST CALL IT A CLEANSING SPRAY.
2060 2018-08-02 19:41:06 In the years preceding the moon landings, the USA spent 0.5% of its GDP on the Apollo Space programme. This was controversial at the time. Furthermore the 70s the US got bogged down in the Vietnam War and knocked back by Oil shocks. In the 80s the US got keen on Small Government
2061 2018-08-02 19:40:49 This is a gift to Big Oil so that Big Oil will put money into their future campaigns. 

Common good will be far down in the list of priorities so long as money runs politics.
2062 2018-08-02 19:40:41 Oh yeah, even for crude oil price rise BJP is responsible? Not a BJP fan, but wondering from where the commies get such cockeyed idea?
2063 2018-08-02 19:40:36 Stopped at Extra Foods gas station for gas. And, putting in some oil into truck before we head on the road to Vancouver.
2064 2018-08-02 19:40:21 No. Someone had the impression that I didn’t know not to use oil. What fucked up question was that, right?

2067 2018-08-02 19:40:07 Is it old-fashioned to still expect oil filter for your 5th anniversary?
2068 2018-08-02 19:39:59 The analytics are a major part of it.  People hate Kapler because of all of it.  They don't understand analytics and therefore want "old school baseball."  Kapler's some new age analytical coconut oil whack-a-doo and they'd rather have Bowa.

2076 2018-08-02 19:39:22 I still think $ZN doesn't find oil when they release that data in 2 weeks, in which case another 40% drop would be likely. I did cover some of my short though

2084 2018-08-02 19:38:27 i know I'm late to the game, but I started watching Occupied. Whoa boy. Never thought thorium would be such a great plot line for a political thriller! IRL I wish the Russians were infiltrating the US b/c the US was nobly phasing out oil & gas extraction, but alas
2085 2018-08-02 19:38:07 Plastics are made from oil, why is it surprising that they emit carbon as they break down? Logic

2090 2018-08-02 19:37:27 She was, but I deserved it. To be fair to her, she taught me how to care for my own thick, curly hair better than my bloody Irish parents lol. She taught me oil and a comb are my friend. I've never forgotten her help.
2091 2018-08-02 19:37:17 Wish I had someone who would do oil changes for me cause I hate waiting all one while it’s being done at the shop 
2092 2018-08-02 19:37:15 Does that act fund the camouflage coverings for the oil rigs in the parks?

2099 2018-08-02 19:36:13 You can’t slick a can of oil, a can of oil just can’t be slicked
2100 2018-08-02 19:35:40 Noticed during the current heat wave that people are very quick to blame things outside themselves for global warming: the government, the corporations, the oil companies,  Trump, etc.

Yet very few people are willing to address their own consumerism, wastefulness, and diets.
2101 2018-08-02 19:35:39 Can anyone recommend any CBD oil to help with cancer? I'm looking on the internet but I'm bit confused of what sort to get.
2102 2018-08-02 19:35:37 @teslacharts appears to have a very close relationship to Larry the fossil guy. He took it very hard when Larry's boss wanted him to get back to work instead of losing all his oil money  shorting $tsla.
2103 2018-08-02 19:35:34 Tried to buy groceries with my drivers license, however because I wanted to purchase imported olive oil I needed to go home and get my passport #groceryID #TrumpSucks
2104 2018-08-02 19:35:26 Not at all!!! I cleaned the chicken and put it in a large container. Smothered it in olive oil, approx. 5 tablespoons of minced garlic, and a generous amount of honey. Let it sit in fridge with lid on for a couple of hours, and then threw it on the grill!
2105 2018-08-02 19:35:10 You can use just a tad bit of oil instead of the traditional tons of olive oil
2106 2018-08-02 19:35:07 Sell more gas & oil....if cars could run on coal...he'd want that too.  We are now following the rest of the world with archaic policies.
2107 2018-08-02 19:35:03 Writing a novel reminds me of cooking.  The beginning is planning, shopping, figuring out what characters to invite.  The middle is wild, with pots clattering and knives chopping, boiling water and sizzling olive oil.  The ending is hopefully satiating.
2108 2018-08-02 19:34:55 You don’t want to half ass on the ass oil, else you won’t achieve Full Throttle.  It’d be Half Throttle, at best.
2109 2018-08-02 19:34:45 Hey @Flipkart i bought a Indulekha oil from ur site.But sadly i'm telling u that u r selling duplicate product.When i match its smell with original it was different ,bottle color was different ,writing style on the bottle was different ..Plz dont betrayed with customers ..

2112 2018-08-02 19:34:16 There's NO WAY the Perdue Climate Change Research Center could be right. @POTUS said global warming isn't real. We need more oil pipelines and coal factories! #FakeNewsMedia 
2113 2018-08-02 19:34:09 I take black seed oil and b12 in the morning and lots of water
2114 2018-08-02 19:33:52 yet instead of the liberal's buying a fleet of water bombers they bought a oil pipeline for 4.5 billion dollar's.
2115 2018-08-02 19:33:36 @GEORGIEDARBY missed the Georgie oil fest
2116 2018-08-02 19:33:23 Until we wean off our collective oil addiction pipelines are the safest way to get oil to market
2117 2018-08-02 19:33:19 Lumber falling hard, problem solved, next oil prices
2118 2018-08-02 19:33:04 If a girl can drive stick, change a flat tire, change her own oil, or put coolant in the car, then she’s automatically attractive

2122 2018-08-02 19:32:08 Why not? We’re gluttons for carbon energy. Let’s all buy another vehicle so we can keep up with all the oil coming out of the ground. It’s so nice we can all enjoy today, because tomorrow is concerning.
2123 2018-08-02 19:31:56 Absolute rubbish- you honestly think The EU would make an oil rich / recourses rich Country, like Scotland wait- you’re absolutely deluded if you think that 
2124 2018-08-02 19:31:55 For his oil tycoon buddies to line their pockets and stock portfolios. Increased demand for oil will hike the prices when they claim there is a shortage.

2126 2018-08-02 19:31:38 Taking my car to get the oil changed is frankly less fun than getting teeth pulled without anesthesia or getting a Pap smear. I hate this experience so very much.
2127 2018-08-02 19:31:38 I came for some flame grilled meat not no oil I'd be mad
2128 2018-08-02 19:31:37 They were but I neglected to oil the grates and left a good bit of it on there 
2129 2018-08-02 19:31:14 Hi @asda is there any chance that could provide a palm oil free option for chocolate spread? I just had a check in your aisle and every option had palm oil.
2130 2018-08-02 19:31:13 You could have at least included in your article the current oil price...
2131 2018-08-02 19:31:03 Whats next Crude oil? trees? Usually if it works in one state then the rest will follow!
2132 2018-08-02 19:30:47 Mtwsss! Will you stop that rubbish! Whose fault? PDP ruled for good 16 years without a single functional hospital. How much was crude oil under OBJ and Jona? Your days in the Upper Chamber are numbered. Make my words.
2133 2018-08-02 19:30:43 Jasmine oil is very good for treating and relaxing spasms. It provides quick relief from spasmodic coughs, cramps, congestion, asthma, breathlessness, and even spasmodic cholera. It also alleviates intestinal cramps and pains resulting from spasms in other parts of the body.
2134 2018-08-02 19:30:30 Even if the mother of ya child uses some of the child support money to fund her business, get an oil change, get gas, pay a bill etc. Either way it goes all that shit needs to be good for her to raise that child.

2139 2018-08-02 19:30:05 No. Norway chose to tax oil revenues and bank them. The UK chose tax cuts.

2141 2018-08-02 19:29:56 Honestly if I wrote an autobiography it would be titled like types of coconut oil

Volume 1: Virgin and Cold Pressed
Volume 2: Fractionated and Heat Treated

2147 2018-08-02 19:29:28 I use to work in nothing but oil, however the last several years it's been acrylic. I have plenty of supplies, but no ideas. Given I do mostly abstract, color, shapes, designs, if I don't have an idea nothing happens. I'm stumped. I love painting, but maybe I should venture out.
2148 2018-08-02 19:29:28 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2149 2018-08-02 19:29:19 Sanders ended with this: ".... and finally the president will open his new snake oil factory this evening"
2150 2018-08-02 19:29:17 Alberta has an oil economy and oil prices are rising. Canadian dollar is falling like a rock making Alberta oil producers a lot of money.

2162 2018-08-02 19:27:22 But you cannot really compare Norway few people oil dependant, it was poor before that people pay very high taxes, prices. Has expensive city housing and part private health care, becoming right wing
2163 2018-08-02 19:27:05 Ooh that’s definitely my kind of thing, even though I’m not meant to be having oil  #VeganRecipeHour
2164 2018-08-02 19:26:57 Nice rant but would make more sense if it was the oil sector that were given the relaxed targets.
2165 2018-08-02 19:26:51 cuuuusss olive oil digimanain kl mau dijadiin cleansing oil??? trs pakek yg virgin apa yg pure apa khusus gt sik? :(
2166 2018-08-02 19:26:49 I have zero experience here, but I feel like fish oil may be an answer.
2167 2018-08-02 19:26:41 I hate to admit I have gained 25lbs since the 2016 election. Additionally my Dr. just prescribed me vitamin D and fish oil pills. At least no hard drugs or booze/sex binges. 
My old stress relief habits.
2168 2018-08-02 19:26:39 my hair smells like apples and coconut oil... how delightful
2169 2018-08-02 19:26:36 They were saved; that's where their Sovereign Wealth Fund came from - taxes on oil.

2172 2018-08-02 19:26:04 Oh yea, I know that, the company was so rich that it was unbundled by the government. 

Today, Standard oil is: Mobil, Chevron etc 

You can check the market cap on google.
2173 2018-08-02 19:26:02 I bought a car. Fixed a few light bulbs, changed the oil. Yes I am now a mechanic 
2174 2018-08-02 19:25:53 Yet you fail to cover ETP?  Hi dividends and high oil.  This price has been setting up for months!
2175 2018-08-02 19:25:47 Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface.
2176 2018-08-02 19:25:44 Trump is a great president? He's been to overseas, like Canada. He's met with the president of Puerto Rico. He knows some of the foreign oil comes from other countries. Separates children from their parents. Cheats on his wife and Mexico will pay for the wall. America deserves!
2177 2018-08-02 19:25:30 Omggg ajshsj thank you sm<33 I use a shampoo with vitamin E, a conditioner with coconut oil, styling cream for curly hair and a serum called “super skinny”..(yes that’s what it’s called dhdh)

2184 2018-08-02 19:25:04 Oil and Gas seems to be kicking off in Norway again starting to see a few jobs poping up. Would go for them but having nuclear on your CV feels like the mark of Cain. Anyway I'm told it costs a £100 for a burger and a few beers in Norway.
2185 2018-08-02 19:25:01 Lmfao. Y’all could do a photo shoot like this but as like an oil painting

2198 2018-08-02 19:22:22 Would be interesting to ask one of these Big Oil operators what percentage of his oil rig workers are ILLEGALS. 
Lately, it's no wonder there is an abundance of those jobs!

2200 2018-08-02 19:22:07 Railroad Conductor. Oil well Worker. Longshoreman, etc. etc. 

None of these jobs require prior experience. All of these jobs start out in the low six figures or the high five figures. 

These are three examples of jobs I've personally held, with no prior experience.

2207 2018-08-02 19:21:00 Hi friends  
If you feel very lazy/fatigue, no energy, sad, unmotivated, etc. I HIGHLY recommend you start taking daily vitamins such as: Vitamin C, D, B-12, Fish Oil, Apple Cider Vinegar. I’ve been doing this consistently for a month and I feel so much better about my life

2211 2018-08-02 19:20:42 If drugs like Lyrica and Neurontin aren’t helping with the pain, have your doc check your vitamin D level since low levels can cause pain in people with fibromyalgia. Also increase your Omega-3 intake (fish oil, etc) since that reduces inflammation. I’m so sorry for you!
2212 2018-08-02 19:20:41 Cloud data management is the way to go now. I feel oil companies are been greedy by not investing in a lot of undergrads engineers.
2213 2018-08-02 19:20:31 I agree that characterising him as another cartoon racist hasn’t helped. My understanding of the issues with radical Islam is that they stem from Saudi funded conservatism, funded in the end by western cash via oil and arms. Leave ordinary people out of it.

2218 2018-08-02 19:20:06 Oil moved through 17 200 km of oil pipelines,  gas moved through approximately 52 360 km of gas pipelines & 1110 km of pipelines carried other substances. At spill rate of 0.07 that means 49.47 km of these collective lines have spilled or leaked.

2233 2018-08-02 19:19:15 The head of the EPA/Trump know exactly what their doing.

Trump's about the money!

2239 2018-08-02 19:18:50 There's no crime in a govt borrowing money especially when Buhari is using it for infrastructural development,unlike the very incompetent administrations of the past that borrowed in the midst of oil boom and looted all!

2241 2018-08-02 19:18:12 Show me one example of a monopoly that exists without the intervention of government rules, regulations, or other interventions.

By the time antitrust was brought against Standard Oil, they had *already* fallen to 60% market share.
2242 2018-08-02 19:17:52 I admit I do use Lucas Oil products now
2243 2018-08-02 19:17:45 No oil, there are online retailers that carry Contour Plus blades. We'd suggest checking with @GilletteUK for the best available information.

2249 2018-08-02 19:17:05 On Nightly Biz Report tonight (check local listings for time). Tune in! Earnings picture is crystalizing (good), Fed meeting ended (economy "strong")..now what? Trade (ongoing and uncertain), mid-term elections (heightening rhetoric), and Iran (sanction risk to oil pricing).
2250 2018-08-02 19:16:58 Because of the fact that he was alone with a murderous dictator shows the inconceivable ignorance of this idiot and his minions. Vlad could come out and say that they agreed to let Russian oil rigs drill off our shores. How is anyone able to refute his claim ?  No witnesses 
2251 2018-08-02 19:16:56 That peppermint oil made me feel nice.
2252 2018-08-02 19:16:54 Oh screw this waiting for nuln oil to dry, imma get the hair dryer now!
2253 2018-08-02 19:16:39 So the sake is used to make the train go Choo Choo at @Benihana cause I could have sworn they were throwing oil on the grills to make the flames IJS

2255 2018-08-02 19:16:24 Here’s an idea; before posting on Twitter do some research. 5 minutes would provide the answer. I believe google is useful for this. None of this is invented use some critical thinking, don’t be mugged off by the snake oil salespeople -Mogg, Fysh, Farage, Patterson EY al #lying
2256 2018-08-02 19:16:18 They could trade us food? Nope. Gin? Nope, power? Nope. Fish?  Nope. Manufactured goods? Nope. Oil? Nope. Fruit? Nope. Financial services? Got our own. Air hubs? Schipol. Outside the eu rUK has nothing we’d want, at higher cost and lower quality to comparables from the EU.
2257 2018-08-02 19:16:16 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
2258 2018-08-02 19:16:14 Go oil
2259 2018-08-02 19:16:09 Anecdotes have always been used to promote snake oil, they are easy to make up, so this does not impress anyone.
2260 2018-08-02 19:15:59 The head of the EPA/Trump knows exactly what he's doing. He caters to interest groups, large oil, gas & mining corporations, etc. He looks for money & doesn't care about the environment, because what he's doing is not about the environment. It never was. Trump's about the money!
2261 2018-08-02 19:15:54 ●Try out a clay mask
-Clay absorbs excess oil, removes impurities, and even kills bacteria in blemishes for clearer, more even skin. 
● Wash your face in the morning and before you go bed
-Use a facial cleanser to wash off any dirt off your face.Also tone and moisturise!
2262 2018-08-02 19:15:46 Whip together 4 1/2 tbsps daikon with 9 oz jerky. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve on bread
2263 2018-08-02 19:15:31 Have you ever considered forming strong opinions?  
2264 2018-08-02 19:15:28 Why the heck you are bothered? He @ImranKhanPTI is Prime Minister for Pakistan not for you freakin so called western “Aqqa”s. 
You rather fill up the bottle of oil for Nawaz Sharif as you will be his partner in Adyala soon InShaAllah

2269 2018-08-02 19:14:53 The car companies, parts makers, unions, 19 states, dealers, engineers, insurers, consumer groups, and many, many others all oppose fuel efficiency rollbacks. The only ones in favor are oil companies and deeply insecure president obsessed with undoing Obama’s legacy

2271 2018-08-02 19:14:51 God forbid we have clean water, healthy oceans and thriving marine life. No, let’s all succumb to dirt, smog and killing oil slicks.
2272 2018-08-02 19:14:50 Try to remove it with oil :D
2273 2018-08-02 19:14:47 Or better yet, wear gloves. I always do now. That oil sticks around for HOURS.
2274 2018-08-02 19:14:29 Why can the #corbynistas never accept any criticism about the leader? He is a weak man, only skill is to protest and picket! He was never meant to be a leader of any party! Yet he is praised like a demigod! It is so scary that so many are brainwashed with snake oil promises!
2275 2018-08-02 19:14:23 Well that’s not a good thing unless your money is in oil???? So the regulations should go but the demands and expectations should be raised !!!
2276 2018-08-02 19:14:14 LOL if you think Trump supporters are "conservative". John McCain is conservative. Trump is peddling snake oil and his supporters buy it up. You're just shilling for the traitor. You'd rather America burn to the ground than to admit Trump did anything wrong.

2278 2018-08-02 19:14:03 It helps for real - definitely get the oil, it's a bit messier to use than creams but it will be more pure/potent 
2279 2018-08-02 19:14:02 *oil money*
2280 2018-08-02 19:13:54 Oh I'll oil your midden mast...wait...
2281 2018-08-02 19:13:51 I'm shocked this day and age we haven't built pipelines from the arctic where all that ice is melting away & just going into the ocean. Why we can build oil pipelines but not clean water pipelines to bring arctic water to the west coast so they don't get so dried out is beyond me
2282 2018-08-02 19:13:49 Then they could leap to linking your carbon tax loving to your obvious hatred of Alberta oil and the families that rely on it. ‘Did you brush your teeth this morning?...(toothbrush=oil)’ or the popular ‘go on any trips lately? .. how’d you get there? (Spoiler alert...oil)’
2283 2018-08-02 19:13:39 I guess "snake oil salesman" went the way of horse & buggy drivers and Blockbuster video cashiers?

2286 2018-08-02 19:13:16 What’s the best type of oil to fry chicken in ?
2287 2018-08-02 19:12:55 Another thing that helped me was using a benzoyl peroxide fash wash. I had to use oil to moisturize cause ite drying but ive never had acne since or acne scars .
2288 2018-08-02 19:12:53 Is that oil? 
2289 2018-08-02 19:12:43 Hair growth tip because this my shit use wild growth with Jamaican black castor oil and do hot oil treatments 
2290 2018-08-02 19:12:32 And this helps Russian oil interests!
2291 2018-08-02 19:12:27 No, they really aren't.
2292 2018-08-02 19:11:56 I completely agree, it glides right on for me and minimizes my oil. It may be too dry for dry, combination skin?
2293 2018-08-02 19:11:51 Anyone out there used CBD oil/cream for joint pain? Does it help??
2294 2018-08-02 19:11:40 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2295 2018-08-02 19:11:37 Yeah I am not going to paint your house and change your oil without nookie being involved 
2296 2018-08-02 19:11:33 2/ The response to low/volatile oil prices was a reduction in labour costs, hence less need for office space. This was not caused by government but by the mid-2014 oil-price slump. We've seen oil sands consolidation, which is good, but such mergers do tend to kill jobs.
2297 2018-08-02 19:11:25 So very interesting BUT Why are they still so many VLCC storing oil in backwarded markets??
2298 2018-08-02 19:11:20 And you're telling me oil companies don't already have that kind of money? C'mon.
2299 2018-08-02 19:11:14 Oil change, new wipers, washed and vacuumed!
2300 2018-08-02 19:11:11 Where's the receipts Jessica? For oil changes? Tires? 

I live near north of Lamont and commute to my shop on the south side of Edmonton. I can't rack up 80,000km in a year. Mind I don't get $34,800 by claiming I did.
2301 2018-08-02 19:11:06 Tfw you feel like an OG chef after you see fire flare up from the top of your pan after hesitantly dropping a burger patty in hot oil
2302 2018-08-02 19:10:48 maybe an addition? China -> SA OBOR connection, or possibility thereof. China->Iran bolder as heavily invested. Iran->Libya wanted oil transit. Libya connected with dragonbear, Russia will build a military base there. Qatar closer to  Iran/China/Turkey resent yrs
2303 2018-08-02 19:10:46 غدا ولا سحور 
2304 2018-08-02 19:10:46 They should make the oil companies pay since their fracking likely screwed up the springs. Instead, a state the size of Texas is basically doing a GoFundMe.
2305 2018-08-02 19:10:40 tea tree oil!! i literally swear by that stuff it cleared my skin up so well
2306 2018-08-02 19:10:24 ALSO for the next 30 minutes I will be on the Lucas Oil stadium floor near the ConTessa section/the big old GenCon sign. Find me and get a bookmark!
2307 2018-08-02 19:10:24 But those who got the oil wells and the foreign companies are opposing them.

Remember that the victors have the oil wells and the foreign companies. The victors also got the government and power. The vanquished got only £20 and lost their houses.

Now, what do the victors want?
2308 2018-08-02 19:10:21 1-It would be interesting to know what criteria was used for appointment for this particular High commissioner?
2-What relationship does Kenya have with Saudi Arabia?
Trade?Oil? Or religious affair?

2320 2018-08-02 19:08:56 What breakthrough will challenge political will? The hold that Big Oil and GOP party operatives have on Congress is criminal.

2322 2018-08-02 19:08:14 A large part of this is oil & Gas, Britain exported it to EU be4 2010. After we imported it from Norway & Qatar outside EU. Petroleum products are big 100's of billions.
2323 2018-08-02 19:08:13 So this is the rice bran oil some restaurants are advertising as a healthy cooking oil? The by product of producing white rice 
2324 2018-08-02 19:08:10 Nadia and I were chatting about that today and figure the only way we would ever see increased pace of cycle track implementation would be another oil crisis or something otherwise dramatic.

2331 2018-08-02 19:06:51 You need oil in your engine.
2332 2018-08-02 19:06:49 Venezuela seized control of hospitals, oil production and food production. That is not at all what @SenSanders is proposing. He is simply saying we should pool our money under medicare which has a 1.4% overhead cost instead of private insurance which has an average 17% overhead.
2333 2018-08-02 19:06:47 The demonstrators have closed 6 roads leading to west of Qurna1 oil field in Basrah province.
2334 2018-08-02 19:06:36 one protested vehemently and was hanged by those who got the oil wells, as most of the oil wells are in that region of the vanquished who got the houses belonging to the vanquished who got £20.

Those who got the oil wells also got to keep power and government, inviting those

2336 2018-08-02 19:06:26 Why are taxpayers still SUBSIDIZING OIL CO'S? Why do we "LEASE OUR PUBLIC LAND CHEAPLY TO OIL CO.'S WHO RUIN IT? When Corp's leak chemicals, cause cancers, why aren't they jailed, "IF they're people" now? The oil & Gas already belongs to the people, companies just dig it up.

2339 2018-08-02 19:06:00 This is good.  In a certain sense, steel is the backbone of an industrial nation. Aluminum its wings.  Oil its blood.

2342 2018-08-02 19:05:48 Don't mean to pry, and you'll hear lots of quacks touting solutions but did you see they just legalised cannabis oil for medicinal purposes. Hope your liver tests go ok. I once went to see a liver specialist  for my wife in Leeds and he was renowned for surgery that others

2344 2018-08-02 19:05:44 Oh definitely! I would have recommended oxi clean, but I had to check first it was a disfectant, and it’s not. I’ve also learned that Lestoil is good for getting out grease, and oil stains, as well paint, so it might work for ink, if you ever have an accident with a bottle
2345 2018-08-02 19:05:43 Guess empty oil first I’ll give it a try tomorrow

Who wants to talk about filthy, old time-y, oil, when you can talk about the green energy future, on your plastic iPhone, shipped to you from China, on that a cargo tanker, and recharged using nat-gas generated electricity? I mean, come on, right!

2351 2018-08-02 19:05:12 It was awful. I can't tell you what I did...well, you can imagine. I want to roll in a ball when I think of it. Her Jamaican mother taught me NEVER to make that mistake again. That said, her mum did help me oil  and care for my own unruly ginger hair. Bless her.
2352 2018-08-02 19:05:03 Exactly!
Contrast UK and Norway. Both tapped the same oil field. UK chose tax cuts; Norway chose to tax and save the windfall. 
Compare their economies, debt, public services,  inequality, poverty rates.
2353 2018-08-02 19:05:02 the amount of oil they are buying from russia now is 30% of what it was before. How is this better for russsia or helping them, ??

2358 2018-08-02 19:04:02 I don’t see how people take their vehicle somewhere to get the oil changed. I brought mine in because it’s free and I’ve been here for an hour. It doesn’t take an hour to change the oil and rotate tires lmao.
2359 2018-08-02 19:03:56 I know that. I know all cultures are mixtures of other cultures. But there are some people who think that where some people take a step out of their culture into another they are racist, That is what I have a problem with.
2360 2018-08-02 19:03:54 Next year please take roof, delay day by day was not okay. You are ATP/WTA, not challenger. Some tennis players cannot wait delay, they have their certain plans.
2361 2018-08-02 19:03:48 I also discovered my hair really really loves oil versus conditioners. This is a new development. The switch up is so real.
2362 2018-08-02 19:03:40 Jesus, you'd think with all that oil money, they'd be able to afford someone who can use Photoshop better than a nine-year-old. 
2363 2018-08-02 19:03:34 one thing i don’t like about the food trucks out in front of p*per t*ger has to be that they leave streaks of grease/oil/whatever right where the line forms (the ethiopian one was good tho)

The vanquished region got two sets of gifts. While some got £20 each, others got to keep the houses in their

2374 2018-08-02 19:01:51 Do you believe IS are terrorists? Do you believe Saudi export terrorism? Is Saudi an intolerant terror state? Did Turkey buy plundered oil from IS? Has the destruction of Iraq & Libya made the world a safer place? Has It made more refugees?

2379 2018-08-02 19:01:26 And why do they wear a gallon of oil in their hair. It's just gross.
2380 2018-08-02 19:01:25 Once they feel the oil region is threatened, they let loose the whole arsenal but won't do same for human lives.  O di egwu
2381 2018-08-02 19:01:11 What's got them so sore? Are they dry? We had a cat who had that problem and we treated it by gently dabbing some olive oil onto her paws a few times a day for about a week.

(Not if they're cracked, though. That would probably sting.)

It makes no sense to cut living saving science research unless it threatens GOP donors like big oil. Doppler RADAR saves lives in Tornado Alley(flyover states). It’s saved mine.

2443 2018-08-02 18:53:34 Yeah, just plain white flour. What helps with this recipe is the liquid is about 1/8 olive oil instead of water, which makes it a lot easier to handle. I also feel like it keeps longer, but I could be wrong.

2447 2018-08-02 18:53:15 She deeeeefinitely wasn't doing something as thoughtful as that. Honestly I dunno why you'd diffuse tea tree oil in the first place. It's not all that pleasant to smell.

2455 2018-08-02 18:52:29 I think it's a ploy. Everything the GP said not to eat has contrary advice on WebMD. I did a test...spicy was the only correct one he told me. Ahhh rabbit food for the win and olive oil fresh from the families biz in Italy!

2464 2018-08-02 18:51:47 The problem with tea tree oil in particular is it's generally assumed for topical use and human skin often tolerates full concentration, so even diluting that isn't as much dilution as what would normally happen for essential oils intended for diffusion.  Big yikes.

2480 2018-08-02 18:50:15 If it wasn't for all the gas stations in America then the government could release the energy technology they are hiding. How does it feel to be trapped by oil.
2481 2018-08-02 18:50:15 This is mild compared to what they and their puppet politicians do, which is both bought and sold parties.
Oil and gas and politicians have no credibility.

2495 2018-08-02 18:48:27 Strange the amount of white ppl buying into this rhetoric with absolute disgust for their whiteness. I can't imagine many Jews, gypsies ect saying, yea we are really bad ppl, we deserve what we get. Yet you see white ppl attacking whites for whiteness. Weird
2496 2018-08-02 18:48:16 @TheBreakdown167 that is what it’s like when Springsteen plays Tenth Ave Freeze Out. I used to make jokes about leaving the arena, changing the oil, rotating the tires and returning and he would still be playing. 
2497 2018-08-02 18:48:14 Save a few bucks on car purchase under Trumps proposal? More money spent at pump, more pollution. Money saved on purchase goes to big oil. We still pay... He's just shifting around incomes to benefit his rich corporations. More driving doesn't increase chance of wrecking, Genius?

2521 2018-08-02 18:46:09 Seriously, what is going on here? Can you help me understand why the oil and gas industry is against weed? Or does anybody even understand why they are? I am so confused and it makes me feel dumb like I am missing some huge connection.

2525 2018-08-02 18:45:15 @EnergyPhilFlynn The Bab-el-Mandeb strait got open and secured again. The Hotsis have agreed to a ceasefire. The Saudi oil will flow into the market through the strait again.

2527 2018-08-02 18:44:52 Don’t you mean work better for oil companies? Increased fuel standards means buying less gas. Who doesn’t want that?

2535 2018-08-02 18:44:13 "The phoniest and whitest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2536 2018-08-02 18:44:12 Closest I saw to that was "While a slowdown in oil demand growth may be likely in coming years, there are no signs of a peak in demand anytime soon.”

And that assumes status quo.
2537 2018-08-02 18:43:50 So I’m taking my car to get an oil change and I heard somebody say something’s definitely wrongy’all better not be talking about me

2541 2018-08-02 18:43:33 It really wouldn't take much to fix Venezuela, first they have to learn that sitting around and living off of the oil isn't enough, there is a good model out there called America that they might give a try.
2542 2018-08-02 18:43:22 I think some idiot got the oil in his eye during the school day, so my school imposed the ban

I’ve rubbed a few drops directly on my little guy when he’s freaking out about fireworks or just anxious in general (very rare any more). When I diffuse, it’s maybe a few drops in a lot of water. It should be a HINT of scent, not drowning!

2566 2018-08-02 18:40:23 Ahahahahhabababa ... another thing that normal people didnt have understand yet : all eco technologies requires petrolium to build all 'plastic' components, so the oil industry its extracting more oil than ever thanks to eco technologies ..

The Grand Inquisitor demanded his auto-da-fé, and the spiteful heretic, who knew the oil was going to be lit anyway, refused to play his game.

What a wicked little creature she is.
2588 2018-08-02 18:37:54 It’s oil & gas industries at its finest. Instead of manipulating scientific evidence of global climate destruction, starve scientific data at its source. A bunch of greedy old men are determined to destroy irreversibly our  for billions in profit.

2594 2018-08-02 18:37:13 Just spent $100 at Walmart all I got was 3 bags of groceries and a oil change 
2595 2018-08-02 18:37:10 Because Trump disciples live in areas that are dependent on car manufacturers, oil, oil transport and industries like steel that benefit from car sales. They seem to believe better car standards as affecting the profit and low-wage job quantity negatively.

2601 2018-08-02 18:36:12 I don’t know what’s more draining- sitting at the car dealership waiting to buy a car or sitting at the dealership because you came for an oil change and suddenly there’s 14 other things you need done..
2602 2018-08-02 18:36:10 So, the conventional coconut cleansing oil is just that, oil. I miss the oil-to-milk lol. Maybe later, after I finish this bottle.

2668 2018-08-02 18:29:53 Y'all should be playing with your Aunty Esther's fragile heart,you hear? I know Dammy wants to kill me nitie,so she can inherit my perfume oil. But Fab,you too?!
2669 2018-08-02 18:29:41 Midnight Oil: "Few of the sins of the father, are visited upon the son." Then, further in: "Still it aches like tetunus, it reeks of politics."
2670 2018-08-02 18:29:28 The 'union' is nothing more than a kidnapping and mugging. It is England's business plan which it has repeated around the world. The unionists have poisoned Scotland. This should be an oil rich country that cares for the less fortunate. The status quo is not nearly good enough.
2671 2018-08-02 18:29:19 Friends & money, oil & water
2672 2018-08-02 18:29:18 Call me crazy but I wouldn't join the Military just to be forced into more pointless wars such as Vietnam and Desert Storm, just for some Oil or to get rid of Communism on the other side of the world.
2673 2018-08-02 18:29:09 .1 We don't want fossil fuel and oil pollution; elite parasites have stolen 5300+ free/extremely low cost patents from us; CO2 has NOTHING TO DO W/GLOBAL WARMING!! CO2 FOLLOWS temperature change by 700-800 YEARS! Look at the 1 mil + year Lake Vostok & Greenland ice core charts.
2674 2018-08-02 18:29:09 Okay crafted a couple oil blends~ Now I'm gonna do art things x3
2675 2018-08-02 18:29:05 What kinda beard oil? Cause ya boi tryna grow his beard ASAP
2676 2018-08-02 18:28:43 "vegetable oil, refined starch, and sugar in desirable mixtures."

Basically, this is the recipe for 75 percent of the food products that people throw down their hole.

2678 2018-08-02 18:28:20 @ford @FordPerformance  hey Ford. If my engine oil line comes loose and sprays oil everywhere , can that cause engine damage? If I can't see oil on the dip stick is that bad for the engine?
2679 2018-08-02 18:28:19 I need to get some @KCHairOil because all the oil and grease under my cabinet does NOTHING to relieve my scalp 
2680 2018-08-02 18:28:11 is a snake oil salesman and a fraud.
2681 2018-08-02 18:27:50 Going Saturday! Can’t wait! #MAGA
2682 2018-08-02 18:27:50 Decided since today was shot for work, I might as well go get my oil changed and a warning light looked at... the country pop radio station in the car place is making me reconsider my choices.
2683 2018-08-02 18:27:46 It may slow down climate change by affecting practices and investment in green energy. The only problem in Alberta is farming and Oil (the two biggest polluters) are exempt from the carbon tax.
2684 2018-08-02 18:27:46 It looks like an oil check.
2685 2018-08-02 18:27:41 Sawa. Tutaanza kula nyasi. Shida zetu zimeisha!
2686 2018-08-02 18:27:28 Oil change today 8([€
2687 2018-08-02 18:27:09 I left the house to come home and find my toddler covered in my Amika oil!  #Amika #burnedhereyes #playwithyourowntoys
2688 2018-08-02 18:27:03 So how do i remove henna from my hair? I heard oil works but? Any other methods? I’m quite tired of this colour now
2689 2018-08-02 18:26:57 They're gradually turning Abj to Lagos kenan,suyita komawa KO kuma kwaji haushin da mukeji
2690 2018-08-02 18:26:52 “If I see you use paper towel in here, you’re going to get sh*t-canned. I mean it, only microfiber towels and Lucas Oil wax.” -Sheldon 
 Yes, sir.
2691 2018-08-02 18:26:50 One of those countries in Africa too that he maligned. Nowhere he might get special treatment. Iran and Russia are buddies so I think the Iran/ Trump feud is all for show to drive up oil prices (Iran and Russia both benefit).
2692 2018-08-02 18:26:36 Yeah but we still need to act, oil & gas won't last forever, clean renewable energy is the future & it's where all the jobs & money will be, if America don't invest they'll lose out big time
2693 2018-08-02 18:25:51 save money, do your own oil change
2694 2018-08-02 18:25:44 I just Googled & I have remedies. I got a coconut +tea tree oil mix & aloe vera. Help restore my thighs 
2695 2018-08-02 18:25:35 Oil is back up to $70/bb
2696 2018-08-02 18:25:26 I used some agave oil as deodorant today and it really worked
2697 2018-08-02 18:25:20 Did you write this? This is amazing! I've been trying to shoo friends away from this snake oil multilevel marketing mogul for months, and you beautifully, elegantly expressed the argument and criticisms that I was unable to articulate or even form. Thank you so much!
2698 2018-08-02 18:24:58 Ok ma,so how is abuja,now that we know you're in Abj
2699 2018-08-02 18:24:53 I have a love/hate relationship with @goop. Love a lot of the info but hate that 95% of the products featured are crazy expensive. $300 face oil?! $125 night cream?! $800 sweater?! Come down to earth #goop.
2700 2018-08-02 18:24:49 They’ve waited their whole lives for a snake oil salesman like Trump to tell them their mediocrity is someone else’s fault. Now they’re high on Victimhood and entitlement.
2701 2018-08-02 18:24:44 Oil pipe.
2702 2018-08-02 18:24:43 Just drink some Castro oil with orange juice it works lol
2703 2018-08-02 18:24:36 I mean as long as it’s food, well made and doesn’t use truffle oil, I’m probably in. And yeah a good Chicago dog is nice. They should just be a standard ballpark thing.
2704 2018-08-02 18:24:35 at the end of the day my back hurts my clothes got stains of rat droppings and oil stains but shit man the feeling of dismantling my first car engine feels great, way more therapeutic than washing dishes and mopping floors or handling cash registers.
2705 2018-08-02 18:24:26 Rockefeller's Standard Oil at pre the breakup zenith would have been more than a trillion. Plus, that was monopoly control of the lifeblood asset in the industrial west, not just a bunch of stupid iphones.
2706 2018-08-02 18:24:22 @SkinnygirlBrand I can’t ding those little individual wrapped chocolates that were made with coconut oil. Mom found them at Wal greens. I love in MS
2707 2018-08-02 18:24:22 I can't get over Buhari wanting to use our sovereign wealth, $2b to build refinery in Katsina! In 21st century? The guy's memory still exists in the 70s, 80s. Buhari used same to explore oil in the Tchad basin! So archaic! Buhari belongs to a museum in Daura... No need!
2708 2018-08-02 18:24:15 Reuters - Oil major BP has started discharging about 1 million barrels of Angolan crude to a Chinese independent refiner, after holding the oil on water for two months due to slowing demand from private refiners, sources said on Thursday.
2709 2018-08-02 18:24:08 Yes. That one goes to US? Is that correct? Bitumen is no longer economically viable. I can actually anticipate Cdns having to subsidize oil cos shipping bitumen in the NOT so distant future just as BC residents subsidize excess electricity being sold cheaply.
2710 2018-08-02 18:23:56 Is this before or after you shrink Organ Mountain Desert Peaks National Monument and sell off other public lands to your oil and gas donors?
2711 2018-08-02 18:23:52 I don’t. Most of my coworkers work while high tbh lol. But they’re really cool about it—one of them said he would buy me some cbd oil stuff to put on my knee for pain. We’ll see! But yeah these pain killers...my body doesn’t even take cold meds so my liver is like wtf
2712 2018-08-02 18:23:41 I want that job where you get to wash the ducks who got stuck in oil spills
2713 2018-08-02 18:23:37 After the introduction of new sanctions by Congress, Russia will stop selling oil for dollars, go to the Euro and the yuan. No one will need the dollar except the Americans.
2714 2018-08-02 18:23:25 Thank you. Been eating chicken soup stew, mango tomato salsa (veggie fruit deuxe bowl... and rice. Chicken enchiladas.. Taking fish oil. I'm a crazy milk drinker, go thru 8 oz glass + 8oz in coffee..(lb of sugar I drink 2/3 coffee 1/3milk) Cheese. Light on meat usually.
2715 2018-08-02 18:23:21 Trump wants to help big oil get more money by stopping fuel efficiency and clean air standards. Most Americans cant afford to run out and buy a new car, he and his friends can. I guess he expects us to recycle cars for steel because he doesn't want old cars on road.
2716 2018-08-02 18:23:14 DRINKING OIL LMFAOOOOO
2717 2018-08-02 18:22:57 Three years after countries vowed in Paris to keep warming “well below” 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, greenhouse-gas emissions are up again. So are investments in oil and gas. In 2017, for the first time in four years, demand for coal rose.
2718 2018-08-02 18:22:57 You think you have a hard life? Imagine going inside for a snack and all you can find is gluten free Carb Sense tortillas and organic coconut oil next to the caramel rice cakes
2719 2018-08-02 18:22:51 USD index, commodities including oil, stock- all on the upward journey! Some one must be wrong! Now, who is on the wrong side?
2720 2018-08-02 18:22:45 Vitamin E for marks, Vitamin C for glow and Tea tree oil for breakouts
2721 2018-08-02 18:22:35 The difference coconut and castor oil makes to my hair >>>
2722 2018-08-02 18:22:21 Ja sakti ho aunty tum.. oil doesn’t matter.. its ur ego who won’t allow.. ego ko 2lt ka tail lagao n jao
2723 2018-08-02 18:22:08 Next they'll call it renewable oil - ha ha ha
2724 2018-08-02 18:22:05 oh my god same, anything "oil reducing" dries my skin out even more ;-;. i have to avoid matte foundation because it makes my skin peel
2725 2018-08-02 18:21:39 Peppermint and lavender oil in a bath is amazing 
2726 2018-08-02 18:21:31 Using the oil analogy here cause I’m guessing you like it! ;)
2727 2018-08-02 18:21:30 รำคาญเสียงตัวเองตอนนี้มากเลย เเต่ก็เป็นคนพูดมาก จะไม่พูดก็ไม่ได้

2729 2018-08-02 18:21:03 my car wants to flash indicator lights when I was already headed to get the oil changed  like one problem at a time please.
2730 2018-08-02 18:20:54 and the mane choice growth oil
2731 2018-08-02 18:20:45 UP BY THE PLACE HEAVEN PINCH BULLY MONGREL NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY 1 EXIT 99¢ BE BEEF TURN MAIL FEAR CENTER CHECK
2732 2018-08-02 18:20:39 wild hair growth oil the goat.
2733 2018-08-02 18:20:35 Marigolds have Pyrethrum, which is used pretty heavily in insect repellants. Even just planting Marigolds helps against mosquitos, but the oil extracts are fucking great at it.

You can spray the perimeter of a yard and basically be mosquito-free, which doesn't suck.
2734 2018-08-02 18:20:32 Yeah i know they can't be trusted my point was the argument that we have to share the oil with England that's the argument that arsehole Dan Snow made he said we'd be selfish if we didn't share the wealth with England
2735 2018-08-02 18:20:28 Relaxing while the car get tires rotated and oil changed. I'm adult-ting alright
2736 2018-08-02 18:20:16 Oh boy, i know that feeling, its like your legs run out of oil
2737 2018-08-02 18:20:01 Clean oil!!!!!! That’s a good one. 
2738 2018-08-02 18:19:52 If they didn’t spend on building factories and buying machines to make cars how would they make cars? You know the oil rigs that pump oil out of the sea bed. Super expensive to build someone has to pony up the cash in advance and then the rigs pump oil and make money.
2739 2018-08-02 18:19:50 In 2006-16, as Asia’s emerging economies forged ahead, their energy consumption rose by 40%. The use of coal, easily the dirtiest fossil fuel, grew at an annual rate of 3.1%. Use of cleaner natural gas grew by 5.2% and of oil by 2.9%.
2740 2018-08-02 18:19:50 Love this pic. I have been calling him a snake oil salesman since day one!
2741 2018-08-02 18:19:47 I just dipped my finger in the oil to see if it hot enough to fry my cauliflower...... thank god it was still cold
2742 2018-08-02 18:19:44 Also niacinamide & zinc serum. I like the one from The Ordinary. And a really good quality moisturizer is super super important. Slather that crap on so your skin produces less of it’s own oil. I’ve been living the greaseball life for years I got you.
2743 2018-08-02 18:19:34 あざますー！
台風過ぎてからまためっさ暑いですし、OILさんも体調にお気をつけて！
2744 2018-08-02 18:19:18 Funny how those same devs don’t do their own oil changes.
2745 2018-08-02 18:19:17 Self care in the form of turning off the lights in the break room, listening to Enya, rubbing lavender oil on my temples, and looking up out of state Air BnB’s

2751 2018-08-02 18:18:26 why do i get tea tree oil in my eyes every morning
2752 2018-08-02 18:18:26 When Railroad Commission staff makes the statement, “Texas has to have oil and gas” it sounds like a heroine addict needing their next fix. We can and must break the addiction. #Divest #KeepItInTheGround #RenewableEnergy
2753 2018-08-02 18:18:22 Yes I would agree, outside intervention is often a problem,especially when there is oil.
2754 2018-08-02 18:18:10 Jajaja no sabe ni lo q dijo.... Y stos son los periodistas q nos informan...
2755 2018-08-02 18:18:05 cattle in feedlots do not consume 100% grain.  The consume a diet created for them in their stage of growth depending on what is available locally.  It can be part distillers grain, ground corn cob or straw, hay, oil seed meal, beet pulp and vitamins and minerals.
2756 2018-08-02 18:17:46 Thanks to Robert Lambert and his tweet conversation my notifications have been busy on here today without me realising  The oil discussion continues I see! #Speedway
2757 2018-08-02 18:17:37 It comes down to this for me. Less oil is good and the car companies have quickly adjusted and accelerated development to meet those standards. It seems the regulations worked and another benefit is the auto industry has created new technology driven manufacturing as a result.
2758 2018-08-02 18:17:36 Its not about profit atm
Its about shaling up the industry
Tesla will be leaders when people see the benefits and the oil industry finally collapses
2759 2018-08-02 18:17:24 Oil bodh sexy
2760 2018-08-02 18:17:08 Every single day we cause numerous problems by our barbaric use of oil and trees, by poisoning the earth with #chemical #waste. But the biggest blow to nature we cause by acting selfishly in our relations. Since this level is the highest, it causes a common crisis. #environment
2761 2018-08-02 18:17:03 You fell for every lie this "snake oil salesmen" spewed from his orange head! At the same time, you belittled, ignored, lied about, & insulted a highly intelligent competent truthful woman @HillaryClinton.  You & your ilk are responsible for Trump & the state we are in! Apologize
2762 2018-08-02 18:17:02 An oil industry's unfortunately-not-last-gasp for air?
2763 2018-08-02 18:16:56 Tell Erdogan. His Tankers are supplying 42% of Israel’s Oil?
2764 2018-08-02 18:16:53 Why don’t you green light dumping raw sewage into it like you have to our other waterways! How can you even spew this crap while your investing in oil pipeline and letting heavy emitters get a free pass! Liberals hypocrisy at it’s finest! Pathetic!
2765 2018-08-02 18:16:52 ヒゲ食べてる
2766 2018-08-02 18:16:48 That one dawn commercial where the lil ducks are getting cleaned after being sludged by oil n they look so happy once cleaned n stuff, love it 
2767 2018-08-02 18:16:44 Not to sound like I live in a tree or something, but Marigold Oil does fucking wonders.
2768 2018-08-02 18:16:40 $4.5 billion on an obsolete and environmentally destructive oil pipeline. Mr. Trudeau, you're not protecting anyone's retirement but your own.
2769 2018-08-02 18:16:30 Ur own the engine be fresh or slightly used? So I know if I buy oil when coming... U go see.. U go cry... Today wayaasi b3y3 shi basaaa.
2770 2018-08-02 18:16:29 I feel like the most important part about blaze is getting the timer down for oil burns so you can chain burn or lay oil.

2772 2018-08-02 18:16:05 What an awful, embarrassing article to put on your front page.

"Don't celebrate Apple's accomplishment, because 1) they might not maintain their meteoric rise and 2) may not maintain their spot at the top. Also, here's a russian oil company we're speculating on."

#Clickbait
2773 2018-08-02 18:16:01  it’s that fake coconut smell sis not good like the oil
2774 2018-08-02 18:15:58 @TheNutRoaster i ordered from you recently & you asked me to let you know where I’d heard about your products.  I heard via twitter (think it was a Northumberland info post) and since your peanut butter has no sugar and more importantly no palm oil I was glad to order from you
2775 2018-08-02 18:15:48 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

2778 2018-08-02 18:15:23 I forgot to bring my holy oil for this room 
2779 2018-08-02 18:15:21 After the introduction of new sanctions by Congress, Russia will stop selling oil for dollars, go to the Euro and the yuan. No one will need the dollar except the Americans.
2780 2018-08-02 18:15:16 Finished reading “The Boys in the Boat” 4 out of 5 stars because most of them went on to become oil men or war machine engineers, but a heart wrenching story of strength and resilience during the Great Depression and Hitler’s Olympics
2781 2018-08-02 18:15:14 More likely you see hydrogen FCEV as the real threat to gasoline. Your Twitter posts don't give your explanation any credibility. If it walks like an oil shill and quacks like an oil shill...
2782 2018-08-02 18:15:13 Coconut oil and castor oil. And deep conditioning treatments. And if u can try to snip away some fried ends. That what I did at least 
2783 2018-08-02 18:15:09 Boo frigging hoo. I couldn't afford heating oil last winter.
2784 2018-08-02 18:15:08 Someone buy me oil paint for my bday
2785 2018-08-02 18:15:05 "To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo."
2786 2018-08-02 18:15:01 Coconut oil ain’t good ???
2787 2018-08-02 18:14:53 No sir, basic economics of the oil industry had nothing to do with it. But keep trying to peddle this nonsense like your job depends on it!
2788 2018-08-02 18:14:49 Coconut oil under my eyes and on my lashes before bed has been good to me  my mom always told me get your skin in check before you turn 30. Trying lol.
2789 2018-08-02 18:14:48 Is this pronounced like "hhh - oil"
2790 2018-08-02 18:14:34 We had a masseuse come into work today and I think I picked up a few new tricks after my back rub. I'll always provide a Twitter friend discount to anybody who needs to get a few kinks out, you just need to provide your own oil
2791 2018-08-02 18:14:25 Ashley and his dad are arguing how much oil to use to fry an egg
2792 2018-08-02 18:14:17 Eater Beware! Keto is a fad diet and terrible for you! Bahahaha... tell that to the 4 prescription drugs I no longer take. And have a Parmesan chicken salad cooked in coconut oil with feta, kalamata olives and homemade Keto dressing. #smartass
2793 2018-08-02 18:14:13 About to put this coconut oil all ova me, lay out & let the sun do its thang ya dig ? #GOLDEN 
2794 2018-08-02 18:14:12 @TrevorGHouser I would challenge the aptness of "percentage of countries" in almost any context. Also, does is not look like that second graph was too hastily pumped out? The effects of a freeze at different oil prices are mislabeled...and is that a cursor in the title?
2795 2018-08-02 18:13:31 Apart from being among #India's top few oil suppliers, Iran is important for providing a transport corridor to central Asia via #ChabaharPort
But USA wants to impose sanctions on countries that import oil from #Iran
This is complicating global equations & pushing all towards #WW3

2803 2018-08-02 18:12:31 Always use coconut oil Shelby just dont do it every day only once on awhile
2804 2018-08-02 18:12:29 Also, if you’re into oils... rosehip oil not only helps with acne and scars, it adds a really pretty glowy tint to your face after application. I pair it with grapefruit essential oil and it’s BOMB on my dark stops.
2805 2018-08-02 18:12:22 Why bother dumping used oil in a container when T-L pivots dump it on the ground everyday?
2806 2018-08-02 18:12:21 Coconut oil for sure! It’s best to put it in your hair and wait like an hour to wash it out.
2807 2018-08-02 18:12:21 If only Norway could build a cover of some sort over the country ( along the lines of Trump`s wall), they could carry on selling oil whilst buying electric cars
2808 2018-08-02 18:12:20 See, my problem is then I spend 10 min trying to smooth it back out... Otherwise the oil pools and I have to stir it on next open...
2809 2018-08-02 18:12:17 just found out dale chugged 8 quarts of motor oil
2810 2018-08-02 18:12:13 Yes, it is catching a lot of attention in Canada, because its meddling in federal Canadian elections (and bragging of it!), and it is supplying a lot of foreign money to anti oil sands and pipeline groups.
2811 2018-08-02 18:12:02 Jamie Oliver shags olive oil and laughs at homeless people pass it on
2812 2018-08-02 18:11:48 Pity your slab crew didn't protect Taxpayers from the any idiotic PFI deals your crew thought was a bargain not to be missed.. Or.. protect the Scots from being wealthy from OUR Oil resources... Or.. say no to sighting NUKES near Glasgow...
2813 2018-08-02 18:11:43 @PressSec misprint: Don't you mean,
"Automakers, Oil Companies, and Lobbyists" instead of "jobs, consumers, and environment"?

Nothing about encouraging less efficient cheaper automobiles helps America, it just shifts profits to wealthy investors.

2823 2018-08-02 18:10:52 Oil is used to help bind the shale. Bend 1 is notorious for breaking up.  Maybe they put the oil down after the last heat so it would soak in and get to the base coating for the next meeting.

2827 2018-08-02 18:10:18 My wife makes a solution of water, cypress and peppermint oil and puts it in a spray bottle. I heard lavender scent works, too. The spray solution helps some, but you have to apply it frequently.
2828 2018-08-02 18:10:14 I’ve spent the last hour of life looking at NBA Oil Paintings for my room.

2844 2018-08-02 18:08:19 Clean Natural Gas will play a very big role in moving ships on the ocean in 2030 an beyond. BG was bought by Shell in 2016 or so, the acquisition makes Shell Oil the largest LNG player in the world. Once 2020 rolls over the diesel prices have to rise due to IMO rules - so buy LNG
2845 2018-08-02 18:08:16 God will protect His elect here on earth (saved from wrath) provided one has enough oil in  their lamp. Don't you trust Him?
2846 2018-08-02 18:08:13 Read the policy again. It doesn't say no oil sands. Or, continue to play the victim and pretend this isn't the trend amongst global financial institutions. It's 2018, catch up.
2847 2018-08-02 18:08:12 Of course trump will sacrifice 100s of thousands of lives to increase oil companies profits. Pollution/global warming don't even exist in the idiots mind. At this point in time there should be no vehicle manufactured that is not a hybrid!!! @RepAdamSchiff

If you did, you wouldn't sponsor the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which will drive the orcas into extinction. Your phoney Oceans Protection Plan is primarily for oil spill cleanup.

Then bough a book at B&N on the way home.

I am the absolute some of zero impulse control. Didn't even need the box.

2937 2018-08-02 17:57:59 ร่างกายต้องการปะทะธรรมชาติ ไหนเนี่ยยเวลาว่างอยู่ไหนนน ทำงานทู้กกกวันนนน
2938 2018-08-02 17:57:57 this will be the first of a few to follow, including $GOOG and $AMZN. Maybe 1-2 oil companies thereafter.
2939 2018-08-02 17:57:54 I got my tanning oil, my dark tanning oil, for tanning by the pool.
2940 2018-08-02 17:57:47 Use argan oil, or a moisturizing hair mask from the drugstore or hair salon
2941 2018-08-02 17:57:45 Oil line
2942 2018-08-02 17:57:35 i mean i dont know any really good products but castor oil has been told to help make it grow faster? but honestly hair mask will work and consider a trim?
2943 2018-08-02 17:57:19 Why is this oil change taking a hour 
2944 2018-08-02 17:57:13 Use coconut oil it’ll help make your hair healthy again
2945 2018-08-02 17:57:10 It's a delta soup made with Oil Palm Juice. Its called Banga
2946 2018-08-02 17:57:08 I got the pit crew oil change at Walmart...they obviously don’t know what pit crew stands for because I lost the race last year at the rate they are going #stillwaiting
2947 2018-08-02 17:57:00 Bad people in all cultures and religion. The West have killed millions and left millions more homeless for their fight for oil etc etc. But that's ok tho because it's not us eh
2948 2018-08-02 17:56:59 สุดแล้วววววว
2949 2018-08-02 17:56:55 I don’t get @realDonaldTrump’s need to repeal fuel standard rules. Doesn’t he get that clean air is a good thing, and more efficient cars leaves more money in the pockets of consumers? 

Nope, he’s more interested in helping oil corps make more money, clean environment be damned.
2950 2018-08-02 17:56:49 Experts called emission standards the single most important action taken by any country to address climate change. It reduces oil consumption, lowers our trade deficit and increases national security. Hence the @GOP has proposed to massively roll back car emissions standards.
2951 2018-08-02 17:56:39 I don't agree we went to war for oil but if that is your belief it raises the question why Dem policies of prohibitive laws & taxes preventing domestic oil & gas exploration & production We can only ask what are the real objectives of Dem policies that force US oil & gas imports?
2952 2018-08-02 17:56:28 Hmm been cramming things recently, maybe that's why. Time to hibernate and take my fish oil. Thanks for looking out :)
2953 2018-08-02 17:56:26 The kind with the Jamaican black castor oil .
2954 2018-08-02 17:56:22 My cannabutter recipe for banana bread is three heaping cups of finely ground death star to one jar of coconut oil.

Prepare for mf'n lift off.
2955 2018-08-02 17:56:10 Haha thanks! I think everyone struggles with self esteem. TAKE YOUR FISH OIL IT HELPS hahaha
2956 2018-08-02 17:56:01 They will pay pipeline fees not own the entire oil field In perpetuity
The oil will still be used for the betterment of the people 
Long neglected under Saddam Hussein he took much of the wealth for him his friends & family
& Those who towed the party line
2957 2018-08-02 17:55:52 اظن الشيخ خالد الجليل.
2958 2018-08-02 17:55:44 She should own the libs by rubbing herself down in baby oil

2960 2018-08-02 17:55:33 2) Apply to an itchy beard ample amounts of moisturizer like a beard oil, or other product. Try to avoid moisturizures with alcohol in there as they actually dry out your skin.

2962 2018-08-02 17:55:26 Well, I’m a fan of very light seasoned flour and veg oil. I don’t like tempura or cornmeal at all!!!!
2963 2018-08-02 17:55:06 And Oprah is a snake oil salesman but you know that already.
2964 2018-08-02 17:55:01 ولع فالاكونت وخلص
2965 2018-08-02 17:54:57 Cammesa y Enarsa x ej ya no operan más en el MULC. Les dan los verdes directamente! En Julio habrían importado GNL, fuel y gas oil por más de USD 500 millones.
2966 2018-08-02 17:54:52 Lol I been wondering is dat oil in the bottle
2967 2018-08-02 17:54:46 You've done nothing but backdoor deals and steal money from the taxpayers! At the end of your term you will have cost the taxpayers billions of dollars in which there will be nothing to show for! You peddle nothing but snake oil!
2968 2018-08-02 17:54:33 Drilling vs buying oil. Rig rates and offshore projects. If we stopped investing for 4 years 2014 to 2018 we may have a real problem by 2022 if we can't get the capacity to meet the offset demand that is baked in the cake already. Rather than surplus we will see shortages 1.5-6%
2969 2018-08-02 17:54:26 I feel very ambivalent about AAPL being the first company to ever cross 1T market cap. Great for tech, horrible for poor people. Tech hasn't done enough to bridge the gap between haves and have nots. We are marginally better than big oil. I guess that pirate flag makes sense now.
2970 2018-08-02 17:54:25 So 3.7 MILLION jobs, manufacturing back bigly, tax cuts, illegals deported, border wall in works, talks with NK, US Embassy moved to Israel, release US prisoners frm NK, US oil prod. up, individual man. 4 Obamacare eliminated, food stamp drops 1/2 mill. in month! Gorsuch, 4.1 GPD
2971 2018-08-02 17:54:18 #FakeNews China’s biggest oil and gas producer PetroChina debuted on the Shanghai stock exchange in November 2007, becoming the first $1-trillion company in the world.
2972 2018-08-02 17:54:15 If you had used vegetable oil to get it open, that would have been a Lockwesson.

If you had fashioned lockpicks by whittling down the remains of a T-Bone steak, it would have been a Lockwollensky.

Both of these partner well with a Locksmith.
2973 2018-08-02 17:54:11 I’d rather just do the oil change by myself, this shit is way too expensive 
2974 2018-08-02 17:53:58 Since I’m driving to ASA, is leaving my desk in the middle of the day to get an oil change procrastination or conference prep?
2975 2018-08-02 17:53:57 a oil change doesn’t take more than 15 minutes it’s too hot to be out here 
2976 2018-08-02 17:53:37 I have committed many crimes in my life time but using oil spray on the sunbed when it states not to has to be the riskiest and most anxiety provoking of them all
2977 2018-08-02 17:53:35 They’re dealing with SEC stuff. Red tape is like swimming in oil. It sucks! 
2978 2018-08-02 17:53:30 The world is loosing the war against Climate Change. Emissions are rising, investments in oil & gas are up & in renewables slowing. Although #primitive #trump & pathetic #GOP lead congress are helping, it’s everyone’s fault. Mankind is loosing the war & we all will pay the price.
2979 2018-08-02 17:53:26 Finally took my car to get a oil changed...after being 3,000 miles over 
2980 2018-08-02 17:53:26 Yes and no. That argument would mean extra virgin olive oil is no good and creatine is dangerous. We know both are not true.
2981 2018-08-02 17:53:04 *goes to get oil change* 

Tech: Hi, we changed your oil, but you need a new filter, all of your tires are down to the thread, your battery is dead and buried, the engine has fallen apart, and your vehicle only has 72 hours to live 

Me: Okay, so how much is the oil change?
2982 2018-08-02 17:52:42 And a lot of oil executives' second homes are going to be underwater.
2983 2018-08-02 17:52:39 Time to throw money on my baby get her oil change and maintenance before the storm
2984 2018-08-02 17:52:20 Haven't a clue - at a guess the oil tank pipe - but bloody good way to make me watch the video about 10 times or so and look at stuff on the internet to try and find out.
2985 2018-08-02 17:52:11 I’m getting an oil change right now to procrastinate
2986 2018-08-02 17:52:07 The west wanted their oil. Bush wanted to carry on where daddy failed and manufactured evidence (lies) him and Blair and all involved should be in jail.
2987 2018-08-02 17:51:55 Double acting bsy pore oil....loffer understand it
2988 2018-08-02 17:51:50 Currently rolling THE fattest joint w some oil spread for 11:59pm... #ASTROWORLD
2989 2018-08-02 17:51:46 Use CBD Oil for pain, but have never used it for anxiety. I know Camomile Tea, Relaxing Music & a Mantra should help with the anxiety...
2990 2018-08-02 17:51:39 Adding a little bit of sesame oil into your stir frying oil is secret cooking tech

I know sesame oil isn't the cheapest oil to buy but you only need to use a little at a time so it lasts a lot longer than you think
2991 2018-08-02 17:51:38 Talk about the oil companies & the effect of coastal drilling on marine life. There are alternatives to fossil fuels, time to put them in place to save our planet. When other life forms become expendable, how long be fore humans are also expendable?
2992 2018-08-02 17:51:16 I’m hope he don’t take long doing my oil change I’m tryna go do what I gotta do and come back inside
2993 2018-08-02 17:51:16 Vape the oil. Way cleaner

2997 2018-08-02 17:50:42 i had a real bad one a few months ago & i put lavender oil on a cotton ball & left it in my ear all day. & for temporarily relieve blow a hair drier on it! it feels so much better with the heat!

Loads of electricity surpluses in hydro rich provinces .. and with 4h time difference different demand peaks from 4 am BC time to 8 pm NF time .. plus reduction or even elimination of foreign ( human rights abusers) oil imports into east coast via St Lawrence river.

3009 2018-08-02 17:49:31 That's crazy talk. Related: I want my car insurance to cover free oil changes.

3012 2018-08-02 17:49:07 You can't speak to station staff if you are already on the train when the idiot gets on. I had this on a packed morning train a couple of weeks ago, totally unreasonable. Station staff should stop it happening. Oil and ripped tights, gets the day off to a great start.
3013 2018-08-02 17:49:02 Pls post one cop each at the least on the RAJNIGANDHA - Indian Oil building  stretch at every cut where people try 'me first'  stunt to get on the other side of the road.. This would solve the problem.. Timing between 6.30 pm to 8 pm @noidatraffic Thanks
3014 2018-08-02 17:48:54 I might have to postpone my wrestling ring.  I also started a workshop last night to make the oil.   Hmmm I could do a soft opening tomorrow.
3015 2018-08-02 17:48:45 Rhetorical question? How about vast discovery of oil and the establishment of oil lobby? Big money...
3016 2018-08-02 17:48:44 If the Euro goes UP. Brent Oil Priced in Dollars does what?
If USD /Euro drops the spread between WTI/Brent does what?
If the traders exploit the spread what happens to US Gasoline prices?
The are things you need to think about going into 2020
3017 2018-08-02 17:48:40 I have no idea, but it definitely sounds bad enough to be from a sport where two dudes in speedos oil up and wrassle.
3018 2018-08-02 17:48:30 The inversion method: for one week per month, once a day, you wet your fingertips with some hair-appropriate oil, flip you head over and give your scalp a good 5-minute massage with your fingertips.

3031 2018-08-02 17:46:59 We need to know which oil / auto companies are behind this move. We have a right to take our business elsewhere.

3033 2018-08-02 17:46:46 Haven;t seen it, but read history :) Britain & US propoganda in Iran to protect their access to oil (or any propoganda interfering with other countries) isn't a good thing. 
#FastCoBookClub
3034 2018-08-02 17:46:40 I just saw an ad for some TV show involving Dick Cheney. Let the record show that Mr Cheney is a massive son of a bitch who lead this country into a Iraq, in order to get oil and has blood on his hands. May the Universe have mercy on his soul, for I shall spare none. Fuck him.
3035 2018-08-02 17:46:22 Remove the word, Russia, and insert Democrats. At this point they are both on the same side.
3036 2018-08-02 17:46:22 Was going to get my oil changed, but the speedy lube was closed. The owner died and today was his funeral. Went and got gas and priced some tires. Hankook any good? Tomorrow, gonna go get my oil changed and price a battery for the car.
3037 2018-08-02 17:46:16 I completely agree with you on this. We need to get the oil to market or nothing is going to happen for Alberta.
3038 2018-08-02 17:46:09 When I moved back to Florida in 13 I planned on a smaller house w solar energy 4 power not far from a beautiful beach.

3044 2018-08-02 17:45:32 China's been in Africa for a DECADE.
They are poaching rhinos for their horn used in TCM, they are sucking up Nigeria's oil, and African rare wood lumber. All the U.S. is doing paying $$$$ mercenaries to make war n profits for defense contractors. Squandering our treasury.
3045 2018-08-02 17:45:31 That should be criminal to charge over three hundred dollars for a face cream with mineral oil omg
3046 2018-08-02 17:45:28 The diesel fuel produced from Nigeria’s best crude oil has a sulfur content of 0.13 percent when refined, check out canadian oversea exploration ltd XOP it has drilling plans in Africa in 2019 to chase low sulphur oil too.

3048 2018-08-02 17:45:23 I have to buy Dutch or Irish butter because I have no idea if German butter is actually butter or margarine.
(Some of the German butters are "butter with 10% sunflower oil")
Is this not terrible ?
3049 2018-08-02 17:45:19 Seems not fresh. I used to eat it in Sardinia, with grated scamorza afumicatta, olive oil with basil, pasatta, ruchetta (rúgula in spanish, I don't know its english name) and raw & dried prosciutto. Now in Venezuela, I couldn't find them all. I miss italian simple food so much :(

3051 2018-08-02 17:45:11 just punched myself with my nose ring...ow. my eyes are watering and despite me washing my hands already, they still smell like chai essential oil from bed bath & beyond. done.
3052 2018-08-02 17:45:08 Yeah, tomatoes, pasta, olive oil, beans/pulses and wine. Saying that though, I increasingly use British rapeseed oil so could probably live without the olive oil, for a bit anyway. I actually don't think there'll be much of a food shortage but I expect prices will rocket.
3053 2018-08-02 17:45:04 Yep, I'm a middle-class hypocrite. Decrying climate change and snorting petrol at dinner parties, without a care for all the violence that the oil trade causes.

3059 2018-08-02 17:44:29 Couple key things- 1. Needs good rub and either a brown mustard or olive oil pre rub. 2. Temp control is crucial. Got to have an indirect heat side of grill to slow cook. 3. Obviously use a good wood chip 4. Need to wrap it tightly  in foil when done and put it back on Bbq 30min
3060 2018-08-02 17:44:07 I have to sit and get this oil change for an hour fuck
3061 2018-08-02 17:44:03 #Cash #Sweepstakes #Giveaway #Summer #RoadTrip The biggest lesson I've ever learned was to ensure my car was running well before we left. Tires, oil, coolant, etc., are very expensive and frustrating to deal with on a road trip. Best to be prepared and do it in advance. :)

3064 2018-08-02 17:43:49 I was getting my oil changed & the guy was standing at my car window and said “you’re playing beer pong on your phone? Is THAT how ready for the weekend you are?.... do you ever just carry shots in your car & feel the need to take one? I won’t tell”

3069 2018-08-02 17:43:33 Wow.. Never use the coconut oil sunscreen before, I think I'll try it. Thanks for this info! We have sun the whole year, so it's kinda compulsory to use sunscreen on daily basis. I have a sensitive skin, too. I don't wanna get toasted by the sun. Sunburn is painful as a b*tch.

3073 2018-08-02 17:43:20 Good grief people. Auto makers can make cars more efficient now but are not allowed to due to emissions. Automakers and oil companies have been fleecing drivers for years. Why do you think they put all that electronic shit in cars?

3079 2018-08-02 17:42:51 Pity he didn't follow through on that. Buying a pipeline, approving 2 other piopelines, building a new one, locking in oil subsidies for 10 more years, supporting LNG.  Any one of those = COMPLETE betrayal of those exact works. @JustinTrudeau is, in fact, as big a liar as Trump.

3092 2018-08-02 17:41:38 #Greece - TV Channel owned by oligarch family that owns Motor Oil, mentions that Minister praises Motor Oil for paying for repair of Lyrio Children's Institution gutted by fires in Mati. Where would Greece be without its oligarchs?
3093 2018-08-02 17:41:19 NK uses old Soviet tech from Russia for their ICBMs.
Russia likely provided the nuclear tech NK used to build hydrogen bombs. Putin asked Trump to suspend SK readiness exercises. 
Russians violated US sanctions of NK to provide goods & oil. 

And those remains aren't our heroes.
3094 2018-08-02 17:41:18 Not pleasant, but very true. I think that Cons want Canada to be like an US colony.

3117 2018-08-02 17:38:33 This move by 45 is fueled by sheer spite, feeding hatred of the black president, and pandering to Big Oil. It only works to sabotage efforts to control global warming, which is already devastating huge portions of the country. He couldn’t care less.
3118 2018-08-02 17:38:16 I put coconut oil in my hair to help condition it, washed it and let it dry naturally and 2 minutes before I go out I go to brush it... turns out still loads of it in and it looks like I’ve got greasy hair :) and now someone’s in the bathroom and will take about 40 mins :)

3123 2018-08-02 17:37:48 Honestly there are very few thing scarier than watching your car go up on the giant lift at the shop when you’re getting an oil change
3124 2018-08-02 17:37:43 Eek, that looks painful! Spray on coconut oil sunscreen is my favorite. I walked outside all day in 104 degrees and direct sun in Montana, not one bit of sunburn. Feels like I'd safely walked through fire, it was weird. XD; Usually the sun fries me after about 15 minutes.
3125 2018-08-02 17:37:41 Coffee + MCT oil is a game changer

3130 2018-08-02 17:37:16 It's availability data, so that info isn't available, but safe to say it's primarily processed foods, rather than increased veg oil use at home.

3132 2018-08-02 17:37:10 It’s an oil based cream its like putty oil in water. If they don’t bother that they swim with cream on they will be peeing in your pool.

3141 2018-08-02 17:36:45 The one benefit of having removed my lash extensions then missing my appointment is the fact that I get to use all of my oil cleansers that get no love 
3142 2018-08-02 17:36:27 Rich nation? If that's the case why has glasgow got 10 of the most deprived areas in the UK? & if anyone has made money out of the union it's London 40 years of Oil flowing in helped create city of London boom as industry destroyed up here & helped create tax breaks for the rich.
3143 2018-08-02 17:36:27 We need a DLA fuels person to weigh in here.

Compromised priorities.

3173 2018-08-02 17:32:57 There are no additives. The problem is that components of the gasoil react with components in the fuel oil that degrades or solidifies the fuel oil or creates the sediment. Most buyers for bunker would reject as off-spec before it even hit the tanks.

It looked like it was going to an oil refinery. But the dots don't quite join up here.
3198 2018-08-02 17:30:15 Russia and Saudi Arabia are pumping more oil until the midterm elections and oil prices have dropped. Oil prices will go back up after the election when our Prez stirs up trouble in Iran.

3200 2018-08-02 17:30:08 Oil! You be nice to Tony. He is a big teddy bear.
3201 2018-08-02 17:30:01 I used to make something similar when I had heaps of winter greens with no destination. Instead of boiling them, I'd cook them down with some oil or pork bits, which helped wick away some of the moisture. 

It should've been called "everything but the soil" quiche.
3202 2018-08-02 17:29:55 May they lose, bigly! He only wants his oil buddies to make even more $$$! F**k Trump!

3206 2018-08-02 17:29:39 #NotMyPresident @realDonaldTrump has always only been the proverbial snake oil salesman, selling what they want to hear.He has been elevated to a cult leader no better or worse than Jim Jones or David Koresh preaching to those unable to think freely, needing daddy's reassurance.
3207 2018-08-02 17:29:36 Congress ke time pe bhi ye sab hua tha bas tumhare kasbe mein nahi. But ye to manna padega ki this govt has done good in road n highway. Baaki kisi mein nahi. Petrol at its lowest despite cheap crude oil. GDP growth at its lowest. Decrease in research funding, open threats!

3210 2018-08-02 17:29:04 If you get a good vitamin e oil thats not too viscous its lit but Rose Witch hazel saved my LIFE.
3211 2018-08-02 17:28:58 I read somewhere there is only about 50-70 years left of oil in the world.  If fuel prices while skyrocket in 20-30 years, will my dream cars become giant paper weights by the time I retire and can buy them?
3212 2018-08-02 17:28:56 Standard Oil still won’t be touched.

3215 2018-08-02 17:28:20 Did you know that early vehicles used fueled lamps before electric lighting became available? For example, the first Ford Model-T used carbide lamps for headlights and oil lamps for taillights.
3216 2018-08-02 17:28:15 China purchases of US oil about 400K bpd.  Already being re-directed to India and elsewhere.
3217 2018-08-02 17:28:11 Oh, I love spinach. I have a spinach salad pretty much every night before dinner :)

I had the kale baked with olive oil, salt & pepper. Not too bad.
3218 2018-08-02 17:28:04 Funny that a citeh shirt, you wouldn’t even have been able to find one before the oil money gushed in. Blackburn shirts before that with Jack Walker. I wouldn’t broadcast the fact you are a fair weather Jonny come lately during our best period in my living memory. What a shambles
3219 2018-08-02 17:27:49 It's a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov.

It's a slim chance I fall, Olive oil.

3221 2018-08-02 17:27:48 there was en ep where he worked an oil rig or sth & had a staring contest with the teen son of the woman he lived with, set to the usual menacing thriller music

it was hilarious.

that should be the show, teen drama but in realtime and with thriller music throughout
3222 2018-08-02 17:27:34 The rollback will be a boon for big oil that ordinary Americans will pay for with their health & their wallets. By 2030, the pollution equivalent of this rollback will be like firing up 30 coal power plants. In 2025, we’ll all pay $17B more at the gas pump if we lose this fight.

3224 2018-08-02 17:27:12 Went to get a oil change messed around and spent $220  ima start changing my own oil
3225 2018-08-02 17:27:00 My point was, these kids sitting on the computer all day, can't even change oil, and are unemployable because they have absolutely no skills, unless it's in the dark with a screen.
3226 2018-08-02 17:26:57 Beat in a splash of milk or cream and 5 eggs. Add parsley if you like. 30 minutes at 350F oven/180C in buttered skinny loaf pan. I use heat convection. Cool then cover and let sit in fridge 48h. Then you can un mold. Great with homemade olive oil mayo or saffron/garlic "rouille".

3228 2018-08-02 17:26:51 MYTH: Rolling back the #CleanCarStandards will save Americans money. FACT: Under the Administration’s plan, oil companies make money; consumers don't save.  #Trump #EPA #CleanerCars #California
3229 2018-08-02 17:26:51 California purchases 2 million cars per year. If we want to set our own fuel efficiency standards so we can breathe clean air and lower our dependence on oil, the federal government shouldn't stop us. We run the auto industry.
3230 2018-08-02 17:26:47 Get your green on. Saute some kale with olive oil, garlic &amp; lemon. Amazing side dish.
3231 2018-08-02 17:26:43 One sheikh said Right from the time of the Rasul PBUh,there has never been a time where music is played during Salah in d mosque except in  our generation.

3237 2018-08-02 17:26:00 I can’t believe people would use tea tree oil in an oil diffuser even if they didn’t have a dog
3238 2018-08-02 17:25:54 a fool: millennials are poor because of avocado toast
people on here: mock this take relentlessly, turn into a meme
me: millennials are poor because products which contain cbd oil, cbd oil dog treats made by racists, etc
people on here: all donate to my patreon immediately
3239 2018-08-02 17:25:48 Agreed. If Jeremy would just come forth and pour some oil on troubled waters that would be great. And leaderly
3240 2018-08-02 17:25:42 I thought we were past the everyone's hands in the oil companies pockets.True story, a professor in Iowa in the 70's,created a carb that would get cars 60 mph. GM bought it, then squashed it. Come to find out,as early as the 1930's similar transactions occured. Wtf are we doing!
3241 2018-08-02 17:25:41 Just like we at FEMA could not go into Louisiana until the governor allowed it
we the hazmat responders could not respond to BP oil spill until Obama allowed it or until it hit land....

Federal support cannot go into Chicago until the state governor and the Mayor allow it.
3242 2018-08-02 17:25:19 It isn't even a reduction. #FAAC fluctuates monthly - dependent on oil prices and production capacity.
3243 2018-08-02 17:25:11 This. Whole. Thread.
3244 2018-08-02 17:25:10 currently comparing cbd oil prices right now so i can confirm this is true
3245 2018-08-02 17:25:09 probably that the mute POST never makes it and twitter validating input is like oil entering into a loving marriage with water
3246 2018-08-02 17:24:48 OK, and we now have airports, paved roads, universal healthcare, universal education, a modern justice system, and various other marks of an advanced society. As for the early 70s climb, you can thank oil.
3247 2018-08-02 17:24:43 Staying in the EU hasn't done it any good either. 60% of mini made abroad, trains made in Germany, energy in France, pharmaceuticals move to Germany, oil refinery moved to Denmark.
3248 2018-08-02 17:24:41 Yep baking a cake? This needs olive oil

3257 2018-08-02 17:24:16 There is nothing about ecology in that whole sicha. The Rebbe said as long as USA is dependant on foreign oil, it handicaps the US from acting in the most just way for the entire world. Absolutely nothing to do with ecology or climate.
3258 2018-08-02 17:24:14 @HailesGoldBuyer how are you ? I am a broker in gold, diamond, ruby, copper, oil, oil and gas of the general trade! I wrote to you because you have understood that I see it as a buyer! It is in this context that I wanted see propose a martriat of work
3259 2018-08-02 17:24:12 From a fiqhu point of view,its not and kamala.
3260 2018-08-02 17:24:11 Roasted with a little olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano. 
3261 2018-08-02 17:24:03 We used to watch his shows and literally every. single. time. the olive oil would be out and drenching the lot 
3262 2018-08-02 17:24:00 Not much to make sense here ford owns him as do oil comapnies they will be the only ones who win here while every one suffers physically, financially, and environtmentally
3263 2018-08-02 17:23:55 I just massaged some breasts in oil.

Cooking a roast chicken.
3264 2018-08-02 17:23:47 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head  @shattawalegh @joeyghanaboy
3265 2018-08-02 17:23:41 Bulk oil is the tits.
3266 2018-08-02 17:23:39 It depends also on your creative needs: pure linen ones are more expensive, but mixed tissue with some polyester or similar are cheaper and work good (oil color included) also for skilled painters, not only for beginners.
3267 2018-08-02 17:23:22 I have 5 - $25 gift cards available for anyone who wants to try CBD oil !! PM me
3268 2018-08-02 17:23:11 Wow if this is oil on my shirt imma be fucking pissed. I swear I hate cooking and I’d do anything to avoid it 
3269 2018-08-02 17:23:03 If I can get 5 RT's for hoofing oil I personally will bring down the unconventional society we know and hate, Cranbourne.
3270 2018-08-02 17:22:59 I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.
3271 2018-08-02 17:22:54 Ok, you’ve helped the top 5% of America’s wealthiest with tax cuts.
You’ve helped the oil industry by rolling back regulations and you’ve helped yourselves to the government trough.
  When are you going to do something for the American People?

3275 2018-08-02 17:22:41 I just had a kale salad for lunch. You can also sautee it with garlic and olive oil, like spinach -- that is, if you even like spinach.
3276 2018-08-02 17:22:38 Any hadith bro? I'm holding a debate and I need evidence
3277 2018-08-02 17:22:37 Being white is so boring, latinx have quinceañeras, Jewish people have Bar mitzvahs and white people have to eat a stale piece of bread and have oil wiped on their already oily pubescent foreheads by an old man
3278 2018-08-02 17:22:36 He wants to Make America Great Again, like putting Cali back to daily smog alerts like in the 1970’s... back when white men were the only chiefs of industry- women and immigrants knew their place- and #oil was king!
3279 2018-08-02 17:22:32 @CircleKStores  My local Macs store had a sign change today.  37 years as Macs and know some big fish gobbles it up.  Still 40% markup?  Any new robbery prevention tactics?  Doesn't Shell Oil of Holland own circle K?

3283 2018-08-02 17:22:04 Venezuela has oil, Russia has oil, Iraq and libya and US has oil, we even had a lot once - the point is that a heavily socialist country, like the other non-oil Nordic countries do very well
3284 2018-08-02 17:21:49 Amin ya Allah.
3285 2018-08-02 17:21:44 if she is trading oil and gas with russia why is that colluding??? she is not trying to sabotage political opponents with russias help. She is not roger stone

3288 2018-08-02 17:21:25 What is killing farmers, miners, oil producers, & investors is the repeal of the Uptick Rule. Collusive Fed/Treasury/Banks using High Frequency Trading to curb any positive price action in commodities. Putting Banks & the State before the people (sound familiar)? #CFTC #Collusion
3289 2018-08-02 17:21:22 You gotta order mustard and then there's no reason for Mayo!!  Egg and oil emulsified on a sandwich is never a good idea!!!
3290 2018-08-02 17:21:10 Oh yeah the product that I really deeply wanna try right now is Jelly Bom!!! and also the bath oil  and bubble roon too!
3291 2018-08-02 17:21:00 He wants to keep people buying gas.  Better for his oil friends.
3292 2018-08-02 17:21:00 @PetroleumMin Sir In noida sector 38 Indian oil petrol pump forcefully selling premium petrol to consumer by showing shortage of normal petrol. Please review, this is against the consumer interest . This has been reported but no resolution.

3297 2018-08-02 17:20:16 Trump is nothing but a snake oil salesman, and there seems to be a lot of snake oil buyers.
3298 2018-08-02 17:20:08 I posted the English for the benefit of those who can't read the Yiddish. Take the square brackets out. The intent is clear. The Rebbe is saying everything should be developed, including oil and coal, and that the problem is there is opposition to developing them.
3299 2018-08-02 17:20:05 Is you gone wash my car change my oil and get me new tires? ...no...then nahh you cant come

3302 2018-08-02 17:19:52 So...took the car in for an oil change and new brakes as we were told last time needed new ones. Took it in,  dealership called to say we needed other crap done.  Unbeknownst to the new mechanic working, we have extended warranty! Bahahaha! No commission for you!
3303 2018-08-02 17:19:52 Says the Governor who continues to side with big oil and gas companies over PA families. @GovernorTomWolf has ignored the pleas of Pennsylvania’s impacted by fracking, Mariner East, and climate change.
3304 2018-08-02 17:19:50 I´m pissed today cause no one cares about mine idea and it is a good idea, to make people think! I was thinking here, some Dr. took my Mother Thyroid, why she didn´t make Cannabis Oil to stop the nodules and other stuff to regulate the hormones! Lets positively touche the reason
3305 2018-08-02 17:19:29 Yeah cut taxes for the wealthy, strip the protections that keep water clean and air safe to breathe to make a profit for big oil and coal companies. AKA your campaign donors. #boughtandpaidfor. #goptaxscam #bluewave2018

3313 2018-08-02 17:18:24 You can buy automotive oil and magazines there too.  Your point? Something being in "grocery store" does not make it a grocery item in the average parlance
3314 2018-08-02 17:18:02 Yea because why bother saving some oil for later generations.
3315 2018-08-02 17:17:59 What is threesome?
3316 2018-08-02 17:17:58 They need this to remove the downward pressure on oil prices. Lower standards translates into higher consumption, lower supply, and higher prices for fuel. Transportation companies will make more, but innovation will stagnate. It’s like the 1970s and 80s all over again. Sad!
3317 2018-08-02 17:17:49 I put hemp oil or some cbd on the gadowty, roll it up in a leaf then wrap a paper it
3318 2018-08-02 17:17:49 Secondly Venezuela is corrupt. That’s why they’re broke. Where’s the $$$ from oil?  Who took that. Where are they?  I’ll be the UK France Switzerland any day.
3319 2018-08-02 17:17:44 Sounds like anxiety but I'm not an expert. Any big changes recently or coming soon?
I don't know how you feel about it but CBD oil works great for me.

3322 2018-08-02 17:16:31 True. I hope you can fight it tooth and nail to ensure that our rupee doesn't further depreciate and the oil prices come down
3323 2018-08-02 17:16:21 Oil changes toThorium Nuclear electricity producers& gets divested funds back if they switch to Nuclear. Im guessing a bunch of the CEOs will end up hanging by a rope somewhere when climate tilts extreme  Imagine the rath of billions of people aimed at a handful of oil guys.

3325 2018-08-02 17:16:08 Our family plane has a 12 qt capacity/8 qt minimum. When we still had the Mustang, that required 12.5 GAL of oil.

3332 2018-08-02 17:15:35 What's all this carry on with rider/mechanic's with oil. I witnessed @GregHancock45 @TeamHancock empty two engines at Cardiff and simply pour it down the drain in the car park 
3333 2018-08-02 17:15:34 Re-read. They're not getting rid of oil.

3336 2018-08-02 17:14:41 Heard recently that @capn_darby has stopped supporting the troops... something about his desire to drink the world’s oil supply, which isn’t possible if America takes it all. @cnnbrk thoughts?
3337 2018-08-02 17:14:38 that guy who said millennials are in poverty due to avocado toast is a fool for not realizing the far more likely culprit is cbd oil

3339 2018-08-02 17:14:35 I don’t understand why a oil change is gonna to take a hour n a half 
3340 2018-08-02 17:14:29 Look up lithium mines an how destructive they are to the environment. Also Wind and solar are not reliable when there is no wind or sun. How do replace a million dollar an hour oil industry out of Edmonton alone let alone the billions of dollars across the country...
3341 2018-08-02 17:14:26 "Thus the free oil as it occurs in the rice is very unstable and deteriorates rapidly. This material is thus the agent which is primarily responsible for the development of rancidity in brown rice."

“My true love drowned in a dirty old pan of oil that did run from the block of a Falcon sedan 1969.”

3345 2018-08-02 17:13:48 Or, for an example that might be more relevant, the thing where Alaska does a sort of UBI-like thing has become the best working example for how to push it more widely. (Pushing it w/ oil $ in Louisiana would be a thing to push even before UBI becomes a nat’l discussion)

3349 2018-08-02 17:13:22 It was just a kid with a clipboard asking for our opinions on the oil and gas industry in Colorado. It could have been a fracktivist or campaign volunteer. Owen didn’t ask and just shut the door.

3351 2018-08-02 17:13:11 Because of the pipeline exemption stuck in at the last minute, this law is hardly an improvement to PA’s antiquated eminent domain laws. A governor less soaked in oil money would have vetoed this bill and returned it to the legislature for more work.
3352 2018-08-02 17:13:09 Only fools would back this stage show of a snake oil salesman

3361 2018-08-02 17:12:20 While a U.S. company had never been valued at $1 trillion, Chinese oil company PetroChina hit $1 trillion in market cap in 2007. (It has since lost 80% of its valuation.) Privately held Saudi Aramco, valued at $2 trillion by investors, is not yet listed publicly

3362 2018-08-02 17:12:13 In the ‘90s I was too busy getting my jam band on at HORDE fest. Living the pseudo-hippie lifestyle trading patchouli oil for devil sticks. Your bee coins would’ve been good for at least a hacky sack or two.

3370 2018-08-02 17:11:28 What's the fuss? Dairy free ice cream is in effect mayonnaise ice cream. You replace the milk and cream with oil. I still wouldn't eat either.

3378 2018-08-02 17:10:13 Sitting and waiting for an oil change has to be a level in hell or something
3379 2018-08-02 17:10:11 Our climate is changing.  We are seeing massive storms, flooding and wildfires. Communities are fighting to survive. The disconnect between use of fossil fuels and our climate is dangerous. Dismantling regulations will hurt the country, but it profits oil, gas and coal.
3380 2018-08-02 17:10:09 the bond vigilantes story was always BS. Many of those BS stories have circulated among economists. Like the economy would halt if oil was above $50. "economy", "the science" is a bunch of tales woven together that was sold as serious work to people not good in math/stats

Why to me #INDIAN #OIL #CORPORATION sends leaking cylinder
3384 2018-08-02 17:10:01 me, watching any child birthing scene in a movie after that summer i wanted to be a doula and witnessed two home births: GET THAT LADY OFF THE FLOOR AND LET HER WALK AROuND! LET GRAVITY HELP HER GET THAT BABY OUT! MASSAGE HER PERINEUM WITH SOME COCONUT OIL! RUB HER NIPPLES!!!
3385 2018-08-02 17:09:27 Mayo is just eggs and oil (barf) which is why I avoid all 3
3386 2018-08-02 17:09:26 Norway has a goal to reduce emissions and sell oil rather than consume it locally. Therefore ICE vehicles have a large surcharge making EVs very price competitive. Also lots of EV perks (parking car pool lanes, ferries). Not to mention the price of gas is high in Europe.
3387 2018-08-02 17:09:23 Don’t think it matters what matters most is india should keep buying oil from Iran and also buy the defence system from Russia take a stand don’t align with USA as we have been doing for long only language Trump will understand is language of strength and business
3388 2018-08-02 17:09:18 Followed!
3389 2018-08-02 17:09:16 Everytime I get a oil change I feel like a real adult 
3390 2018-08-02 17:09:15 Salvation is where the favor of God is! The curse of slavery to money is where there is no favor. Scripture says 22 times you are saved by undeserved favor and nothing else! Fresh oil!
3391 2018-08-02 17:09:12 We have a start. We in Alberta needed the pipeline because we sell the oil for 50% of the price to the USA. If we got more... we would be required to drill less and we get more money for programs to diversify Alberta's economy.
3392 2018-08-02 17:09:11 無理感漂って来た
3393 2018-08-02 17:08:54 Well they’re owned by big oil so they’ll be fine with it. The trump can turn around a create the exact same mandates and they’d be applauding him. It’s all about the hatred for the former president
3394 2018-08-02 17:08:47 If your fantasy mech bleeds, and it's just oil, I'll be upset
3395 2018-08-02 17:08:39 RT : @angrygirl65 ~ No real answers yet. Treating it as acid reflux for now, putting him back on a strict diet. Needs to take Cultrelle, fish oil, vit D and Omeprazole. Sh doesn’t think there’s a bowel obstruction but only time will tell.if he continues this
3396 2018-08-02 17:08:32 Steve Bannon, Goldman Sachs bagman who works for Robert Mercer, who owns a Hedge Fund leading a “Populist” movement against “Globalists”...

How the fuck do “journalists” interview this snake oil salesman without bringing up the obvious incongruity?

3402 2018-08-02 17:07:47 Elsewhere Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia, has reportedly been eyeing a public offering that could value it near $2 trillion, but the listing has been mired with delays.
3403 2018-08-02 17:07:42 I’d rather pour boiling vegetable oil on my balls and cut off my own dick with a blunt fish knife than listen to an album of 80’s soft rock, power ballads and/or kraut rock
3404 2018-08-02 17:07:39 there is evidence that Danny increased the size of our public sector to win votes when we had a lot of oil money and now we can't afford it, but making cuts to unionized workers and service delivery is very complex and should be done prudently i think
3405 2018-08-02 17:07:38 Put coconut oil all over u . It'll not only help with the itching it'll suffocate the fleas
3406 2018-08-02 17:07:27 Try Marula oil. Also buy products that hydrate your skin. From face wash to cream to sunscreen
3407 2018-08-02 17:07:11 There is more to this: The globalists have been keen on steeling Venezuela's oil and minerals, as well as replacing their financial system with Rothschilds central banking, and preserving the petrodollar. This has been a takedown, using Columbia to attack and bankrupt them.
3408 2018-08-02 17:07:09  I told everyone at work that I have to run errands after work tomorrow and all im doing is going to get my oil changed and then going to caribou.
3409 2018-08-02 17:07:06 I need black seed oil
3410 2018-08-02 17:07:03 So far, the weirdest thing about physical therapy is that I am allergic to their standard massage oil and we have to sub in the cocoa butter-based oil. Now I smell like cookies
3411 2018-08-02 17:07:03 Well that’s just lovely, big ass barrel of coal oil, beside the big ass barrel of molasses i prefer my coal oil straight!

3414 2018-08-02 17:06:57 How sad is it that oil changes are cheaper to have a shop do it for you then to do it yourself at home?

3420 2018-08-02 17:06:18 Amazed how few people (very few old enough) to have a clue about CAFE standards or when embargo type fuel restrictions were put in place.  We have more oil than you realize (200+ years at expected increases) and no need for economically crippling EPA regs.  Research, understand.
3421 2018-08-02 17:06:03 I don’t really do the tea tree oil and witch hazel because the aloe and black soap and scrub I s enough for my skin. I constantly hear that them together is good though. However, I would pat my face dry first thing after shower/bath and then apply the tea tree oil and hazel

3424 2018-08-02 17:05:49 is it because of the dependence on oil, or the environment? I still have my parts from 30 years ago, are those new ones last that long? I was not planning on throwing my Lego away anyway, so it does not have to be recycled.
3425 2018-08-02 17:05:48 Was cooking with my dad yesterday, he wanted to add almost a whole bottle of oil, I said dad that’s too much and he just tipped a lil bit out
3426 2018-08-02 17:05:27 role of energy density of crude oil in agricultural production, n feeding us all
3427 2018-08-02 17:05:23 I use Lush products...in a three-step process. I start with their coal face soap which is a black charcoal soap, then I use their tea tree oil as my toner and lastly finish up with their moisturizer called imperialis. I do this in the morning & night. Works AMAZINGLY
3428 2018-08-02 17:05:16 That is great, but most of the ones sitting on the computer all day can't even change their own oil in their car. And they end up being dependent on everybody else to help them. You know that most kids don't even move out of their house now until they're 30.
3429 2018-08-02 17:05:12 Top stupidly hot shoot tip from our makeup artist: Mothefucking PEPPERMINT OIL on the pulse points around your face. I can't get over it.
3430 2018-08-02 17:04:47 I think all this hoopla is just meant to keep oil prices high.
3431 2018-08-02 17:04:41 Money for smart, innovative people— not old rich guys who were born into the oil industry. They don’t want to have to compete.

3433 2018-08-02 17:04:25 Do you think we had the technology back then to meet the goals and achieve economic growth? My take on the latest industrial revolution is it was kicked off by cost-saving in the USA when oil shot up and then economy dove down. Around that point solar energy became competitive.
3434 2018-08-02 17:04:21 I need a whole body massage. Anyone? I got the vitamin E oil
3435 2018-08-02 17:04:13 Curious where they’d stand in real dollars vs Standard Oil, ATT, Ford, JPM in their heydays. Still #1 I’d imagine but would be interesting nonetheless
3436 2018-08-02 17:04:12 This nigga I work with in my car texting some chick but he’s sending everything by voice message. Nigga talking about “when I come up there I’ma oil you up from head to toe to relieve some of that stress.” 

Bro I don’t want to hear this shit. Type yo shit out
3437 2018-08-02 17:04:07 All unhealthy.  Better are roasted potato cubes with olive oil, s&p, and fresh herbs - and don’t forget a pinch of dried pepper flakes to heat it up a little.  Great on preheated very hot cast iron in BBQ.  Delish and healthy too.

3441 2018-08-02 17:03:27 cbd oil literally just dissolved my back pain this morning and kept me from having a full on panic attack when i could have taken a muscle relaxant and a xanax and for this shit to help me replace BENZOS speaks to the importance of the accessibility of cannabis
3442 2018-08-02 17:03:25 They must feel something similar to some of the oil rich areas in the western Africa continent.
3443 2018-08-02 17:03:23 Im sure the underlying reason for his decision is "financial" benefits for him and his rich buddies in the gas and oil industry. He has been known to be involved in business dealings with big Gas/Oil. Every decision he makes is based in his own interests first.
3444 2018-08-02 17:03:22 JHope’s part...how anyone can ignorantly say @BTS_twt don’t make meaning music and art, I will never understand:

breathe, and the interest towards me ends

3446 2018-08-02 17:03:06 And that massive corporate tax cut wasn’t nearly enough! Those oil and gas companies create so many jobs for foreign banks, where they hide their profits!
3447 2018-08-02 17:03:06 Aaaand now Kaitlin has to clean chicken grease off of her weapon and gun oil off her chicken sandwich. So not worth it!
3448 2018-08-02 17:03:01 You know its a shame we are so dependant on cash money hey. And the oil so connected to cash money and an Evil corporation of men in charge of the money. Keeping people sick and killing off humans with provision of extra sugars in their food.
3449 2018-08-02 17:02:46 Same with me but the 3rd to the last time that Jorge did my oil change he somehow didn’t put something on right so it leaked oil and ever since then my dad does my oil changes again 
3450 2018-08-02 17:02:36 Came to Nissan to get a oil change watch they come back telling me it’s some extra shit going on. Bitch no it ain’t gimme my keys and my car so I can go
3451 2018-08-02 17:02:32 Auto manufacturers haven't asked for this. So who is behind idea? Big oil.

3461 2018-08-02 17:01:11 Send the bill to big oil. Now! Start seizing executive estates & assets. What are you waiting for? More poorer people to pay the price?  Big oil to cover insurance deductibles along with any rate increases.
3462 2018-08-02 17:01:09 Lol. Smh. Na there una oil people kuku. It's the oil that makes them not to collect income tax. But then you'll pay a relatively high sales tax and crazy property tax (their houses are very cheap sha).
3463 2018-08-02 17:01:03 And they do this for money for oil companies.

3466 2018-08-02 17:00:46 "The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s largest trade association, asked the same question in 1958 through its air-pollution study group and replicated the findings made by Humble Oil"
3467 2018-08-02 17:00:40 Top tip! If you've got a gate, check that it works properly (oil that squeaky hinge) & has been painted or treated recently. 
3468 2018-08-02 17:00:39 The Liberals & the Alberta NDP have raised taxes, driven away investment $ and killed the Oil industry which is the engine of the Canadian economy now warn us about economic trouble ahead.
That's like a pilot turning off engines mid flight & then warning you're gonna crash!
3469 2018-08-02 17:00:34 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
3470 2018-08-02 17:00:30 Tell you ?? Why ?? Haha. Who the hell are you?? Take a hike. Buy some more oil butter to lick the Dynasty butts. Now run along

3477 2018-08-02 17:00:21 If your qualm was instead over not using the same language as Reuters re: the gas coming from a block, there is no difference between coming "from the South China Sea" or "from a South China Sea oil block", just a degree of specificity on which we disagreed with Reuters.
3478 2018-08-02 17:00:21 "What was new, in 1957, was the effort to quantify what percentage of emissions had been contributed by the oil-and-gas industry"
3479 2018-08-02 17:00:20 Growth commission is a discussion paper that was welcomed believe  it it not by right wing commentators as pragmatic. It excluded oil and demonstrates an economic case for . Will it be easy-  no. Life isn’t. The alternative is isolation in a right wing Tory utopia

3481 2018-08-02 17:00:12 Because Russia and Putin rely so heavily on oil for cash, does it really surprise anyone that all these moves to destabilize the mid east and raise prices per barrel?  This was just a part of the Putin plan using puppet @realDonaldTrump
3482 2018-08-02 17:00:08 It takes awhile for all the oil to come out

3484 2018-08-02 16:59:57 would go with the pre-shaving oil, shaving cream, and the light-weight water-based aftershave lotion in the scent you like for an excellent, irritation-free shave.  Good luck.

And I don't work for AOS. Just like their products. Use it to shave my whole head.

3490 2018-08-02 16:59:13 Sometimes we tweet more than other times, so that can skew what you see, but after such a long drink of dry weather, when it does rain, oil, dust and diesel are bought to the surface making it extra slippery and drivers don’t pay sufficient attention.
3491 2018-08-02 16:59:08 Oil and gas law is hard... but I have to do it. I gats chop this oil money too

3497 2018-08-02 16:58:19 Hmmm.   Maybe give him booby trapped Chopsticks.  Cover them in oil so everything slips out when he tries to pick it up
3498 2018-08-02 16:58:17 It's not ignoring consumers when you do what is necessary to reduce our dependence on oil.
3499 2018-08-02 16:58:12 Iran is  gaining more  ground  in Iraq , as much  as you loos  more , they out witted you only lonely envoy to Iraq ,PM ibadi lost ground as he did not fight corruption as he promised , so you are to be blamed ,heck the most active oil companies  < they re only3, another defeat
3500 2018-08-02 16:58:07 Don't forget that we can reallocate funds already in our reserve and treasury. We don't need a 700 billion military budget, we don't need to let the Pentagon burn trillions a year, we don't need oil subsidies, Israel subsidies, a private jet tax exemption, the list goes on
3501 2018-08-02 16:57:51 People bashing chemo, that's bs misinformation. I'm stage IV esophagus (her2+) right now, caught late, & was close to death. Immediately put on chemo (FOLFOX + Herceptin) seven weeks later, four sessions/rounds, cancer marker tests show a 90% reduction. Due to chemo, not cbd oil.
3502 2018-08-02 16:57:50 You’re thinking of bush2. Remember when dick had meetings with oil companies where they decided what’s in our best interest (energy wise) then told us it was in our best interest not to know what they decided was in our best interest? I do. #ResignNow #TRE45ON

3505 2018-08-02 16:57:40 We hope  the gas and oil prices  do not go up

3507 2018-08-02 16:57:38 This is good news for big oil. Less missions standards, cars and trucks can burn more fuel. Coupled with “clean coal”, we should all have portable breathing devices soon, creating more jobs. #Winning

3511 2018-08-02 16:57:23 I had to hunt out the British section in Korean supermarkets if I wanted exotica like a tin of tomatoes. Once I went across Seoul in search of European-style anchovies in oil.
3512 2018-08-02 16:57:18 It's like CLIMATE CHANGE! If 99 scientists tell you it's happening AND humans are contributing to it, and the remaining one says "Nah they're not" but he's the one getting paid big bucks by big oil, shouldn't you believe the 99 because BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY?

3525 2018-08-02 16:55:30 Wall Street loves Donald Trump. Lessening fuel efficiency standards is another boom for the Big oil profits and Wall Street in general. Business will kill us all for profit. They care nothing about Democracy, only profit.  When greed leads, people suffer.
3526 2018-08-02 16:55:23 Rachel Ray could literally drizzle olive oil on something and her crowd could go wild....I need a crowd to hype me up like that.

3528 2018-08-02 16:55:12 As of Aug/18 what happened to these forecasts by @robertoriverosa : I was right yet again. China is altready suffering from 25% tariffs and US strength and leadership.And many industrues r back: Steel, coal, oil, mining and Apple continues breaking records.
3529 2018-08-02 16:54:37 $CHK 2. The smaller production in Utica is even more than replaced only by more than 6 new strategic Oil Rigs in 2018  ....

3531 2018-08-02 16:54:17 This new Bill would:  The bill includes restrictions on new Russian sovereign debt transactions, energy and oil projects and Russian uranium imports, and new sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs.   This could be just another HUGE plus.  It definately can not hurt.

3539 2018-08-02 16:53:45 MSM has assiduously avoided connecting the Kochs to Putin. Yet, there are numerous links to these oil oligarchs.We are aware of the Kochs propensity to sue, even over relatively minor issues. That should not deter a free press.

3552 2018-08-02 16:52:37 I do. Solar took off in other countries during this time but the oil and coal producers in the U.S. weren't about to let that happen here. Ever seen the trains in Europe? Asia? They're incredible. Shame that bullet trains don't run on coal so we'll never see them.
3553 2018-08-02 16:52:31 @euan85 Can Scotland afford Independence

3554 2018-08-02 16:52:27 The current HR1 end dates the SALT-D, Mortage Interest Deductions, Charitable Contribution deductions, and permanently removes exemptions for itemizes.

3569 2018-08-02 16:50:37 Where does it say anyone blamed the track for the defeat? With regards to safe and legal track; if a track was that rough in Pol or Swe they would be heavily penalised, it is borderline safe and that is not good enough. Legal? Oil on the track is not legal

3579 2018-08-02 16:49:35 There is no reason to build a pipeline & they are never safe. @LouisianaGov is about as ethical as the gas & oil industry are. this is a huge mistake. @LaDemos @Indivisible337
3580 2018-08-02 16:49:31 And by fix, of course you mean gut and strengthen our dependence on a non-renewable resource, further enrich oil companies, and exacerbate the environmental issues your agency was created to address. Basically, you're a lobbyist and a fraud.
3581 2018-08-02 16:49:31 It’s a tough place to carry to begin with, having the oil move so much makes it almost impossible
3582 2018-08-02 16:49:30 Yep it was the oil.

3592 2018-08-02 16:48:34 Put coconut oil on your hands then put on some rubber or latex gloves. After about an hour or so your hands will be hydrated and the skin won't peel as much. Source: I have eczema on my hands.
3593 2018-08-02 16:48:32 Professional chefs are always like "let just put a nice olive oil drizzle over our aioli, grape seed and toasted sesame oil salad."
3594 2018-08-02 16:48:25 I’m scared to even use tea tree oil on my face now because I don’t want my pup to get sick!!
3595 2018-08-02 16:48:09 This isn’t even about facts anymore. This is just a snake oil salesman plying trade at this point.

3597 2018-08-02 16:47:57 New England is currently ABOVE the forecasted electricity demand for the day, and we've got oil plants already coming on line. Time to #ShaveThePeak with @mass_energy and @ri_ppl.
3598 2018-08-02 16:47:50 Snake oil salesmen like to sell snake oil. The market demand is there for it.
3599 2018-08-02 16:47:49 Konsa tea tree oil?
3600 2018-08-02 16:47:47 But the auto and oil industries that donate to campaign funds do!

3604 2018-08-02 16:47:10 Diff between a witch and a snake oil salesman I'd say. If it's all show & buy this to be cured of all your ills, that's BS. An actual witch will be open about what they can & cannot do.
3605 2018-08-02 16:47:07 It's also quite clear that this article has other motives. It states that shifting from fossil fuels will endanger "livelihoods," which is extremely dishonest. A shift to clean energy, like nuclear energy, will improve quality of life for everyone except the oil industry. /2

3608 2018-08-02 16:46:59 So... Trump gets to shit all over us who are concerned about the environment, effectively trolling us, while simultaneously putting money in the pockets of oil companies. That's like a win/win for them.

I wish they didn't behave like children.

3682 2018-08-02 16:40:57 Agreed, but have you checked out the #BarcelonaDeclaration? Our EU leaders sold us out for cheaper oil and bribes from Saudi Arabia. They don't have to change but we will bend over to suit them with Hate Laws and other concessions.

3703 2018-08-02 16:39:39 So they found the highest dose they gave reduced the plaque and also maintained cognitive function, other doses yielded contradictory results. But that's true of many common drugs, biotin for hair growth, fish oil, so many. You have to take enough, for the good outcome, right?
3704 2018-08-02 16:39:37 for oily skin or skin in general every type needs to be exfoliated but make sure since you got only skin not to dry out your face, putting oil on oily skin reduces the most of it since the skin thinks it needs more that's why it produces it. I'm so going deep in I'll dm you lmao
3705 2018-08-02 16:39:36 How can you associate that when I’m talking about changing oil. You idiots will argue with anybody about anything wont you.
3706 2018-08-02 16:39:33 Trump recently begged saudi to pump more oil because of a shortage. So let's make sure cars aren't more fuel efficient.

Makes perfect sense.

3710 2018-08-02 16:38:56 I was just told at the grocery store, that I would need two forms of ID to purchase the family stack of tortillas, (5) 1 pound bags of red beans, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, garlic, peppers, salsa, olive oil, pitas, couscous, hummus, olives, paprika, dates, chick peas and saffron
3711 2018-08-02 16:38:54 He also has his big oil/coal buddies' interests to look after.
3712 2018-08-02 16:38:24 I’m at a 6.5, I think an explicit pre-election quod-pro-quo is plausible-to-likely:  Russia provides election assistance + Trump Tower Moscow ($) in exchange for reduction/elimination of sanctions + support of various policies (Syria, Ukraine, Oil drilling, etc).
3713 2018-08-02 16:38:23 The two variables are price of oil and volume of crude reserves. That said Aramco does so much other business apart from oil, they are one of our biggest clients
3714 2018-08-02 16:38:00 lots going on, Russia has sold all U.S. Debt. Germany no longer buys oil from Russia. Russia and US relations at its worst. Saudi Arabia has bought billions of dollars in Arms from us. Iran deal has seen a backlash to Iraq with power cut off. Not sure how the dots connect.
3715 2018-08-02 16:37:35 I used the Africans best during so it can help my ends while they’re in the braids.... I take a cotton ball and the astringent and clean my scalp since I workout and sweat a lot it helps clean the dirt n stuff and then I put the hair food oil + coconut oil on every night

3724 2018-08-02 16:36:42 Same. Castor Oil daw can help.
3725 2018-08-02 16:36:42 Lol is she crazy ,when did all that rubbish start
3726 2018-08-02 16:36:39 “Start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; ya make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs...And a little bit o' wine. An' a little bit o' sugar.”
3727 2018-08-02 16:36:32 My second fav, second to the year of the oil slicked track
3728 2018-08-02 16:36:31 Not only that it is Obama-era, but that by weakening the rules, it helps the car and oil and gas industries. There isn't a lobbyist in Washington that isn't pinching themselves with glee over how pro-business and anti-consumer or anti-environment this administration is!
3729 2018-08-02 16:36:21 Try that neem oil!
3730 2018-08-02 16:36:14 Exactly. Embrace the fire in your soul and burn a little midnight oil to fire up your players. *OR*... make a game all about air conditioning or ice freezing! The lack of heat! Might feel nice

3742 2018-08-02 16:34:34 Isn't that the point?  Snake oil from a snake oil salesman
3743 2018-08-02 16:34:33 @Tesla @teslamodel3fan @Model3Owners some people go for an oil change every few months. I get over the air updates.
3744 2018-08-02 16:34:27 Saudi Aramaco is worth 1.2 to 2 Trillion dollars based on oil reserves #justsaying
3745 2018-08-02 16:34:25 Obviously playing on the IPAD while waiting on an oil change. 1.5 hours so far and learning all about the new 2019 Cadillac crossover coming out. Smaller.....
3746 2018-08-02 16:34:23 Countries could aline with the united states now its had to do that when those European countries are dependent on Russia but because the u.s has a petrol dolar backed by the Saudis oil we now are there own personal army this is why r economy does not flat line with r high credit
3747 2018-08-02 16:34:12 Today On #PeoplesForum, we are talking about Agriculture as today's oil well

We are discussing national and international opportunities available in Agriculture for the South East 

Join @FabulosGloria and our resource person, Uka Francis for more info
3748 2018-08-02 16:33:59 so after trump gifted corporations with a big tax windfall, he is going to now give oil companies another gift by changing the regulations on cars & trucks so the air is more polluted but his donors have more money. big oil already gets subsidies from the taxpayers
3749 2018-08-02 16:33:57 Honestly rice bran oil
3750 2018-08-02 16:33:57 OIL CHANGE MUCH. HA
3751 2018-08-02 16:33:38 Tea Tree oil works Miracles 
3752 2018-08-02 16:33:37 Seeing the latest heat maps around the world, is purely alarming. I keep thinking how Al Gore was trashed by so many, who had oil interests, when he was explaining scientific realities. Rather than heed the warning, the US has chosen the highway to hell
3753 2018-08-02 16:33:37 the 1% bro - Nisgaa Lisims Government: They don't have title to the mid-and -upper Nass but they will sure try and keep these pipelines alive. We need a hemp pipeline shipping hemp oil Asia, Nisgaa people could stand up and do it w/o NLGovt. Beautiful people, our bros and sisters
3754 2018-08-02 16:33:35 Based on this is it safe to assume "the impeachable leader" doesn't have tariffs on  oil?! 
3755 2018-08-02 16:33:12 Well we won't have to worry about that until you guys have drained every last drop of oil on this planet. Then we can use the engines you've already bought the patents to.
3756 2018-08-02 16:33:11 I’ve gone the whole of July and used one make up wipe. The rest of the time I’ve used cotton pads and coconut oil or just a flannel. Small changes to help the environment and all that
3757 2018-08-02 16:32:47 They work best for auto manufacturers and oil companies.  Trumps proposal hurts environment and worsens climate change.
3758 2018-08-02 16:32:36 Standard Oil was the first $1 trillion company (inflation adjusted). PetroChina was also worth $1T at one point.

3764 2018-08-02 16:32:26 King Salman no longer has authority to raise external oil supplies. A new law went into place last year for all #OPEC nations to consult with each other before increasing or decreasing oil supplies. Your powerless too.
3765 2018-08-02 16:32:18 They listened and it made sense to them. Most people wouldn't even consider talking Climate with people in a "deep red oil state". Talk about food price impacts, agriculture problems that could become more of a problem. Bring it to "their house". Make it real.
3766 2018-08-02 16:32:16 Petite rectification, il y a eu plusieurs entreprises comme la United East India Company ou la Standard Oil Company qui ont dépassé ce cap bien avant
3767 2018-08-02 16:32:16 Well its almost that time of year again. Get ready for back to school with out August special of a 5 quart oil change with a filter for 19.99, Spots will fill up quick so please call the guys at the shop at 410-957-0050 to reserve today
3768 2018-08-02 16:32:13 What is your point? You can’t seem to keep on topic. Carbon taxes, MB NDP gov, equalization, have vs have not... yet no evidence for your first point except mine which you rejected because “oil downturn.”
3769 2018-08-02 16:32:02 Back to #MontelagoCelticFestival again! For those who don't know it there's an hilarious tradition here: if you call out loud for a guy named Valerio you can hear people from all the camp calling for Valerio, spreading like oil!
3770 2018-08-02 16:31:59 Brouwer might be a cheap, veteran Rw option for the Oil. What say you Oiler fans?? #oilers
3771 2018-08-02 16:31:39 Big $$ for oil companies. Bad for those who breathe. He hates California. Connect the dots.
3772 2018-08-02 16:31:33 ท้องร้องดังเกินไปแล้ววว
3773 2018-08-02 16:31:30 You mean the consumers who overwhelming want more fuel-efficient cars and cleaner air? Seems like all your deal is going to do is allow clean air regulations to be ignored while allowing Big Oil to make even more money off of us. Also, whatever happened to States Rights?
3774 2018-08-02 16:31:16 พอได้ฟังความคิดจากมุมของเพียงพบจึงได้เข้าใจอะไรมากขึ้นอีกหน่อย ใช่ว่าไม่รู้ว่ามีหลายคนสงสัยในความสัมพันธ์ของทั้งคู่ แต่จะให้ตอบว่าอย่างไรนอกจากแค่เพื่อนเท่านั้น

3778 2018-08-02 16:31:01 I hv said mine,I'm not responsible for your lack of understanding.
3779 2018-08-02 16:30:51 So the loss of any (other) species is totally acceptable to you, as long as you get to drill another gallon of oil? Cut down all the trees so you can build? Pave Paradise and put up a parking lot? F* the world, I gotta get mine? Such a sad viewpoint.
3780 2018-08-02 16:30:50 A layer of tar, rubber, oil and water won't mix.

3781 2018-08-02 16:30:43 @PoppyLegion protected my garden table with linseed oil, was taken back to having a Lee Enfield 303 back in my hands 
3782 2018-08-02 16:30:42 At 15, I could tear a car apart and put it back together. Drive tandem dump trucks and heavy equipment.  Do plumbing, electrical.  What skills do most teenagers have now. Most can't change their oil. Computer to me, is not a major skill, when the power's off.
3783 2018-08-02 16:30:41 i wonder how the stock market is doing after the price of oil skyrocketed.
3784 2018-08-02 16:30:41 Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself. He doesn't care if he fucks up the climate for everyone. What Trump wants is to score points with Russia.

3809 2018-08-02 16:28:55 Yes, I agree that subsidies for oil and gas should end and that we should dump fossil fuels ASAP. For road transport #BEV is the quickest way of doing that.

-Put vaseline in your lips or coconut oil 
3811 2018-08-02 16:28:53 we can choose between oil from Russia or Iran, others require reconstruction of the refinery

3820 2018-08-02 16:28:00 Oof. Like I don't think that it will, at least not anytime soon, but that is really crazy to think a company could be that size then a sell-off triggers such a drop in value. Certainly oil has different outside factors than consumer tech, as well.
3821 2018-08-02 16:27:55 Not to be pedantic, but combating this may entail a better definition of what @seanhannity is actually peddling.

1) His lies are the "bait".
2) His "products" are his audience's ears & eyeballs.
3) He's peddling Pillows, Crappy Software, and Fish Oil.

3827 2018-08-02 16:27:31 NO body said she had a brain. Let alone her dad and this car thing lower the MPG and they want people to buy new cars with less economy watch the gas prices go up. And who does it help big OIL and the Saudis OK BIG OIL but another country nex we'll be buying oil from Russia
3828 2018-08-02 16:27:16 Yeah Sarah, "winning" Trump's euphemism for imprisoning 711 immigrant, but innocent children, electing corrupt EPA chiefs to pillage natural reserves in the pursuit of oil, increasing average American financial burden by waging nonsense trade war with our largest debt holder...

3834 2018-08-02 16:25:42 I had to advice a client to sell @flyspicejet stock. 

Was a tough contrarian call at the peak of the frenzy in aviation stocks. 

Oil prices were at the bottom. 

#ContrarianInvesting is also about selling when everybody else is bullish.
3835 2018-08-02 16:25:38 Oil Prices fell for a third day, nearing their lowest in two weeks following a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories that added to existing concern about the rapid rise in global crude supply
3836 2018-08-02 16:25:24 @MSNBC @CBSNews @CNN Just had the hottest year on record, oceans R rising, fires all through the western USA, tornados, rain, floods, hurricane this year & idiot republicans & Trump want 2 stop California from saving our planet. This means more gas usual 4 big oil. Vote blue 2018
3837 2018-08-02 16:25:17 It was a traveling collection, that came to my home town. I love his imagination, creativity. If you want to buy any of his stuff, I hope you own an oil well in Texas........hehehe
3838 2018-08-02 16:25:15 Cbd oil
3839 2018-08-02 16:25:09 That's why my average is so low there lol --I can't keep up with the oil changing with the all the guys throwing it everywhere :)
3840 2018-08-02 16:25:02 And who are u to say she'll be punished? Uhum. Careful how u just blame people anyhow. Can't you simply say she was wrong.
3841 2018-08-02 16:25:02 Correct. But "deficits don't matter" according to that Nobel prize winning economist named Dick Cheney.  LOL.  Or perhaps he needed a war to drive the price of oil up, so that Halliburton and friends could justify fracking at a breakeven price of 75.
3842 2018-08-02 16:25:00 BULLSHIT. This corrupt administration is all for relaxing standards for Big Oil and car manufacturers, to the DETRIMENT of the American people. We are watching you and taking notes, Bastards. 
3843 2018-08-02 16:24:54 @realDonaldTrump Just heard you are rolling back fuel mileage standards, which will reduce oil consumption, reduce pollution and create a healthier population. That coupled with your health care pre condition roll back is unbelievable! What is wrong with you!
3844 2018-08-02 16:24:49 BMW may be the ultimate driving machine, but being a leftist is the ultimate hall pass.
3845 2018-08-02 16:24:42 We need blubber for lamp oil! It's the circle if life
3846 2018-08-02 16:24:38 @realDonaldTrump People vote their pocketbook, talk about lowering their gas, oil, cable, grocery, electric bills, etc., that is what they really care about. A 2% raise means nothing if your cost are going up 5%. And explain this to them over and over.
3847 2018-08-02 16:24:30 trump only cares about profits for oil companies! He really could care less about something that would help air quality and more efficiency for drivers! We have entered the most greedy administration!
3848 2018-08-02 16:24:13 It’s fucking amazing how every customer that needs a oil change when we are too busy to do one is magically “going out of town” the next day
3849 2018-08-02 16:24:07 DO NOT give anyone you meet in #OOTT your money. Not for trades (those can be had for free.....just find it). Not for #Oil data (we already have the @EIAgov). NADA. Don't get fooled out here people!!!! #WTI #Crude #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #ES_F #NQ_F #DXY #SPX
3850 2018-08-02 16:24:04 Building a pipeline is a long term investment involving a huge capital outlay. It takes years to build one so in the meantime transporting crude oil by road is the most feasible

3854 2018-08-02 16:23:47 Why is Trump rolling back Obama’s fuel standards. California air is cleaner because of increased standards! He is supporting the oil industry over people and their health! Greed + Stupidity=
3855 2018-08-02 16:23:43 Lol yeah me either  I also use tea tree oil at night that works for breakouts as well
3856 2018-08-02 16:23:34 Looking forward to the elite braids I'm gonna have in my hair in a couple of days. That's what Nigerians know, braids. Because I asked the hairdresser to straighten my wig and home girl doused my wig in Palm oil I'm sure

3862 2018-08-02 16:22:38 That valuation was based on oil price >$80 per barrel, it’s the key variable in the equation

3865 2018-08-02 16:22:18 Another gift to big oil!
3866 2018-08-02 16:22:18 Imagine..... the price of Putin's oil on a astronomic rise, if Trump gets into a shooting War with Iran, and the Iranians block the Strait of Hormuz?

3872 2018-08-02 16:21:49 Oil and Stock market both bottomed about the 4-4:30 am time frame.  SP500, if we continue to rally could make a huge outside day to the upside. Needs to take out 2825.75. The 9 day moving average is at 2820.50. Which is also my 100 period moving average on the 90 minute chart.

3876 2018-08-02 16:21:38 Tillerson, as an oil man, knew what he was doing and knew the dangers of the SA-UAE blockade of Qatar. Too bad that the supposedly dictatorial POTUS Trump didn't get his back. That's how we know who's really (not) in charge of the US.

3883 2018-08-02 16:21:09 Even the oil companies know that there is no future in fossil fuels, they are just hanging on till the last gasp.

3887 2018-08-02 16:20:39 Kratom has helped me manage my ailments better. I was close to suicide and Kratom was my last option. I’m glad it worked. When I first heard of it I thought it was some snake oil nonsense. I’m glad I was wrong.
3888 2018-08-02 16:20:21 Great, we should go back to paper and steel straws anyway. Too much waste that can't be recycled but the big oil lobby is against any plastic alternative.

3891 2018-08-02 16:20:03 Again. There are other countries in the surroundings (eg Haiti) nobody talk about. This is all a plan to get their oil, diamonds and wealth off their hands. And Yes, all sanctions started when Chavez kicked the looters out. Not a poor excuse, fact.

3894 2018-08-02 16:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3895 2018-08-02 16:19:56 Can't make money from increase use and sale of oil and gas if there is good public transportation systems and electric cars..........the rest of the world is leaving us behind in the dust of pollution.

3899 2018-08-02 16:19:30 Read this article about increasing fuel economy causing traffic deaths and find the arguements to be flimsy at best. The roll back of standards is to force more consumption of gas benefiting big oil and then saying we need to open up more drilling sites. Who benefits? Big oil!
3900 2018-08-02 16:19:19 Tea tree oil does wonders for my itchy dry scalp. When I put my shampoo in my hand to use, I mix in 5 drop of tea tree oil and wash my hair with the combo

I would question the description of alt fuel as "criminalized". I think it's more the case of being unable to come remotely close to demand. It's boutique. 
And the amount of power you can squeeze out of a gallon of gas is determined by physics more than Big Oil/EPA.

3944 2018-08-02 16:15:14 personally i think that should be okay since the smell and actual oil itself is probably not as strong after rinsing your hair and stuff, but still do some googling if you want to double check!

3963 2018-08-02 16:13:37 True.  The US military also is one of the biggest consumers of non-renewable resources and oil.  Both parties (including hundreds of democrats) just voted to increase US War budget by a huge amount.  Larger than any other country in the world.

The problem is not just Trump here.

So that’s a hard No!
3992 2018-08-02 16:10:24 Look, there’s Adult-sized Joe and 3-piece* McNugget Happy Meal Joe.

*Back in the days when men were men, McNuggets came 6 to a Happy Meal, in Stryofoam containers.  And they were simply oil, breading, and mechanically-separated chicken containing copious cartilage, but no bone.
3993 2018-08-02 16:10:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3994 2018-08-02 16:10:14 What you mean to say is that oil companies weren't given top consideration. Now, that's what you want to do so they can rape us at the gas pumps even more than they are now.

4003 2018-08-02 16:09:36 it's the 'ecoterrorists' trope, often used by oil shills and hacks looking to discredit those opposed to the pipeline and scare others into believing their opposition efforts are part of some kind of co-ordinated terrorist/extremist movement
4004 2018-08-02 16:09:32 Thanks cleansing oil. Membuat dahiku makin beruntusan :)))
4005 2018-08-02 16:09:21 Do people really think feds care about the environment? If they did why would they approve oil and gas exploration up north. North, where trucks have to travel on ice to get to the posts. Future shipping routes, future fresh water supply.

4011 2018-08-02 16:09:03 This is all about power -> oil -> money. One wonders how Kushner’s furtive trips to SA, solicitation of loans from the principles in this story to shore up his balance sheet, &  the administration’s dogged focus on relaxing emissions standards fit into this narrative. @maddowblog
4012 2018-08-02 16:09:02 You’re a “We just struck oil!” gusher of dumb.
4013 2018-08-02 16:08:57 Lmaooo deadass this is me too. I’ll get my oil changed but right after that I’ll be at ulta looking at primers
4014 2018-08-02 16:08:57 It takes the wise to understand parables.
4015 2018-08-02 16:08:51 And we know that specific coal and oil industries were engaged in active suppression of scientific research to prevent this exact thing from happening
4016 2018-08-02 16:08:43 What's easier: teaching oil drillers to be astronauts or teaching golden retrievers to play basketball
4017 2018-08-02 16:08:41 Lotion should already come with body oil, in it. 
4018 2018-08-02 16:08:29 This figure is not a lie but half-truth & mischievous. OPEC analysis said this was expected sales. Little accounting will tell you that oil revenue without expenditure is balderdash. What was the expenditure at that time? We import petroleum products- how much was spent on that?
4019 2018-08-02 16:08:27 I need a oil change man
4020 2018-08-02 16:08:22 I’ve heard castor oil does but I haven’t tried. I wouldn’t put rogaine there though.

4026 2018-08-02 16:07:37 Fuck the oil and has industry.
4027 2018-08-02 16:07:28 ... why should we believe you? Fuel economy standards drive innovation, and keeps oil prices down, which stimulates the economy. This isn't rocket science.
4028 2018-08-02 16:07:18 bought a 30 gram chilli oil, use it all in 4 dining sessions.
4029 2018-08-02 16:07:07 So we're the single largest oil producer in the world,yet under @realDonaldTrump we'repaying record prices for gas.

4035 2018-08-02 16:06:41 Tem muitos sites falando que a Apple é a primeira empresa a chegar a 1T, mas na verdade tem a Saudi Aramco e o Norwegian Oil Fund com mais de 1T de valor de mercado
4036 2018-08-02 16:06:33 Lemme guess, “Card board oil” = water in spray bottle.
4037 2018-08-02 16:06:31 Why would you ever get an oil change at Walmart. That was your first mistake
4038 2018-08-02 16:06:30 Apparently whale oil from the 16th century through the 19th century was used principally as lamp fuel and for producing soap. Long utilized for lubricating fine instruments.
4039 2018-08-02 16:06:29 Car emission standards - yes. @realDonaldTrump fools America again. This is for his greedy oil producing buddies/Putin pain at the pump. And once again Republican Congress is mute. If you want Washington to function 4 you #Vote4Democrats #November6DDay.

4042 2018-08-02 16:06:12 so the alternative is cleansing milk instead of c.oil? so if we use cleansing milk + gentle cleanser, still can be considered as double cleansing la kan?! thank u kak mai 
4043 2018-08-02 16:06:12 Or...maybe...the REAL deal is so that he and his buddies make more money from oil?
4044 2018-08-02 16:06:11 Finally a leader with perspective. Now oil then push for solar, hydro and wind.

Media deaf on this issue.
4048 2018-08-02 16:05:58 To help his rich$B  oil and gas donors makes more money. Does it sounds like his working in our behalf? His cutting another $100B   taxcut. What programs is he cutting this time?
4049 2018-08-02 16:05:57 I’m dead  what kind of oil is this pls poor fuckers
4050 2018-08-02 16:05:56 How things must have changed! In the 2008 Texas Energy Report, Comptroller Combs reported that wind received 3.4% of federal support, and oil and gas received 99.6% of state and local incentives. Why then are out of state fossils paying for attack on wind? They should share data.
4051 2018-08-02 16:05:52 Oregano oil!!! Dilute and drink that shit. Also, Zicam swabs.

4062 2018-08-02 16:04:37 But it’s sterilising. But ok, boiled water (cooled obv) with lavender oil. It’ll still sting, but not as savagely. Or wash the whole infected area carefully and slap some magic balm on it. Do you have any magic balm? (That’s my generic term for a medicinal balm!)
4063 2018-08-02 16:04:23 Environmental, diversity & socialist front groups get the biggest public cash payouts. You show how little you know about how politics works. By the way, Solyndra was a cornerstone of Obama's "new clean energy" for the future program. Oil companies - 100 years+ & still going...
4064 2018-08-02 16:04:19 It’s stupid to vote for someone to spite their opponents. There was a lot of vitriol against Obama & Hillary too but that’s not a reason to support them. Vote based on what the candidates say & do.

4071 2018-08-02 16:03:39 no that would’ve made it melt. you probably put too much oil or butter. unless you melted the butter because you forgot to put it out before you made the cookies like my dad does every time he tries to bake
4072 2018-08-02 16:03:27 I'm a wolves supporter, and I'd like to think we don't use oil but I can only believe what my eyes see. But maybe your right with them using it on non race nights, but what do I know other than what I'm told or scene
4073 2018-08-02 16:03:22 You were the oil to my water

4083 2018-08-02 16:02:36 I waited an hour to get my oil changed. 30 mins into waiting the mechanic told me there’s a Jiffy Lune up the street if I didn’t want to wait. I just laughed lol. I wouldn't let those Jiffy Lube clowns get within 10 ft of my car
4084 2018-08-02 16:02:34 The dude like it's a 2 hour wait for your oil change with no appointment. That's fine I brought food and my haircut spot is across the street and my phone charged. I'm here for the long haul lol
4085 2018-08-02 16:02:32 I don’t trust express oil change. Yes I’m a 21 year old girl who might not know anything but I will in fact call my father every time the worker tells me the 18 parts  on my car that “I need to get fixed “ so I’m not getting ripped off

4096 2018-08-02 16:01:29 Since when did Pakistan become an oil/gas producing country?  Pakistan has 51st largest proven oil reserves which amounts to nothing. Get your facts checked Sir.
4097 2018-08-02 16:01:17 Undoing fuel mileage standards will ultimately cause gas prices to rise and will put us back in OPEC's pocket. Bad for the economy,bad for consumers and bad for National Security. @realDonaldTrump and @GOP don't care about this. All they care about are oil producers.
4098 2018-08-02 16:01:16 True. The Kochs own the nearest refinery in Wood River Illinois. Sooo....
It will take 2-3 weeks for the price changes to filter down. In the meantime, the Kochs will try to pump up oil prices with dark trades.
4099 2018-08-02 16:01:06 wish theyd do regular updates on:

-Police violence & sexual assaults

In 1990, Iraq invaded the oil-rich country of Kuwait, claiming that Kuwait had driven down oil prices by exceeding production quotas set by OPEC.

In 1995, China ordered the expulsion of two US Air Force officers for spying on Chinese military sights.
4103 2018-08-02 16:00:41 Been at this dealership since 7:45, it do not take this long for a oil change 
4104 2018-08-02 16:00:39 You did that by keeping our oil from getting world price. The time to panic about cutting the carbon tax has long since passed.

4108 2018-08-02 16:00:29 Otra de las firmas que había llegado al 1T —— PetroChina Co. crossed the $1 trillion mark in late 2007 but slumped quickly as oil prices collapsed in the financial crisis.
4109 2018-08-02 16:00:28 So you really think USA is not interested in the biggest oil reserve in the world?
It is just that social equality is wrong and capitalism and privatisations would be better? Yes of course those vénézuéliens millitary are corrupt. Same as liberals but maybe less.
USA is for oil.
4110 2018-08-02 16:00:19 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4112 2018-08-02 15:59:59 500,000 more barrels per day benefits oil companies & the added demand will raise the price of gasoline far past the alleged savings to automakers.

4192 2018-08-02 15:52:18 Ok, so let me ask then. Why does no government party run on that platform? Is it because the oil industry are major funders of political parties?
4193 2018-08-02 15:52:14 Only result of rolling back will be increased use of gasoline & emissions. Trump has a vested interest in oil & gas consumption/profits.

2. Ice cube or cool tea bag 
3. Use a potato

4217 2018-08-02 15:50:30 The green policy advocacy had more of an effect outside this country as third world nations rely on coal and oil for energy, with the result that many third world economies are collapsing, the the effect of increased illegal immigration to this country.

4265 2018-08-02 15:46:11 Is this meme supposed to be PRO-Trump??? 
"snake oil stone: enables him to swindle idiots."

The rubes who bought the snake oil Trump was selling still believe him!
4267 2018-08-02 15:46:03 About the only thing I do right, with oil, is to never get pot committed on bias. Can turn and burn fast. 

Sorry for the poker jargon, have an itch to play right now.
4268 2018-08-02 15:46:01 True.  However, the computers do not control wear on piston rings that then allow oil to seep into the combustion chamber and pollute the environment.
4269 2018-08-02 15:45:57 My gf uses the elvive extraordinary oil no sulphate shampoo. I Elave sensitive shampoo that's like no sulphates, SLS, alcohol. @MikeDolanVEVO when I tagged you earlier I meant to be replying to this tweet lol
4270 2018-08-02 15:45:51 I felt better when I was taking in more healthy fats like the MCT oil I wanted to exercise, the MCT is hard on my stomach because I have some so many stomach problems but it seemed to help with energy. I dunno what it is but something has changed for her to be in and me out.

4273 2018-08-02 15:45:07 Are the Trump Tariff wars (particularly against China) just another Putin Plan to undermine America’s global influence and democratic power to corruptly align itself with the aluminum , steel & oil oligarchs of Putin’s kleptocracy? #ActiveMeasures
4274 2018-08-02 15:44:43 On @channelafrica1: Protests & insecurity have halted operations to truck oil from Kenya’s oil fields in Turkana County to the port city of Mombasa. Tullow Oil, the British company exploring oil in Kenya, says it’s losing $100 000 daily as a result of this. #SABCNews

4276 2018-08-02 15:44:39 This actually scares me. Is AJ for real or is he just a snake oil salesman like 45?
4277 2018-08-02 15:44:33 @JonathanWilling the D40i’s are the worst! Loud & uncomfortable. Too bad our city is doubling down on oil buses. Literally every busmaker makes battery-electric buses now. Weakest arguments ever to sell the quiet & efficient hybrids. @ottawacity has zero green credibility.

4283 2018-08-02 15:44:03 Chinese strategic intent to develop Gwadar is definitely an advantageous policy for them provided they are able to complete port and inland infrastructure development amidst security apprehensions . An inland move of oil and trade from Gwadar to mainland China is big time saving
4284 2018-08-02 15:44:02 Actually Venezuela started improving under Chavez’s leadership, it’s under Madura things started going south. Venezuela’s problems are complex stemming from a non diverse economy, sanctions and dependence on oil. It’s far more complicated than just “socialism is to blame”

4295 2018-08-02 15:42:54 No, but big oil would love it if people had to buy more gas. Auto makers don't out it more effort than required. They have tech that can do 10x more than they do now they don't do it willingly. Why would they do it now? Delusional
4296 2018-08-02 15:42:54 Edinburgh charity shops are scenes of great drama - production people rushing in to ask 'have you got any little lampshades/fake antique oil paintings/cloth caps/walking sticks/old jugs, doesn't matter if they're cracked?' up/down Dalry road. Theatre, darling
4297 2018-08-02 15:42:52 Ok lets try a different approach. Do you have any suggestions where I can trade oil gold and silver? Lol
4298 2018-08-02 15:42:52 What about the fact that oil is not profitable without govt subsidiaries. While pipelines are safer, it is not 100% safe at all. They always leak. Lastly, if you want to be competitive then switching to renewable energy would be the best decision.
4299 2018-08-02 15:42:48 Laughable. No comparison. Porsche has limited software capabilities and serious battery supply problems. They make fossil fuel vehicles. Tesla decades ahead. Every single car company; every single oil company and every short on WallSt is terrified of @Tesla

4303 2018-08-02 15:42:37 Read the NPR article and do not see a reasonable arguement for rolling back emission standards.  That the emmission standards will impact highway safety is an argument I cannot agree with.  This is to force increased fuel consumption to benefit big oil.

4308 2018-08-02 15:42:08 Market Update: price increase. 

So far today Heating Oil has increased by a large amount having gone up by nearly 0.9PPL and has constantly been rising from 11am today.
4309 2018-08-02 15:42:01 I detest people using the phrase “Big Oil”. Those same people should be free to use the phrase “Foreign Enviro-Nazi’s” as well.
4310 2018-08-02 15:41:56 OIL has judged
4311 2018-08-02 15:41:55 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4312 2018-08-02 15:41:55 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4313 2018-08-02 15:41:53 Scooping up shares of $VVV today as another recession-resistant value stock. Trading at roughly 16x earnings, and stable demand for auto maintenance - people don't stop changing their oil during a recession. Majority sales in N. America - immune from #TradeWar. #StocksToWatch
4314 2018-08-02 15:41:51 Market Update: price increase. 

So far today Gas Oil has increased by a large amount having gone up by nearly 0.9PPL and has constantly been rising from 11am today.
4315 2018-08-02 15:41:50 Exactly. It's down to the choices your Governmnet has made not whether you have oil or not.
4316 2018-08-02 15:41:47 Some of the biggest things in the African world (or black world, if you like that term better) are the metroline in Ethiopia (the only on in sub-saharan Africa), the oil refinery in Nigeria and the Renaissance dam, Ethiopia. I doubt students will learn about them in Black Studies
4317 2018-08-02 15:41:43 Who would've thought I'd be sitting in a garage doing an oil change while listening to AceBaby's Emotions Vol.3. Being a grown up is fun.
4318 2018-08-02 15:41:42 My experience with sunflower oil was that it tends to bubble and boil more, presumably due to water content.  The olive oil seems to work nicely for temperatures up to 140 C though.
4319 2018-08-02 15:41:30 Our meteorologist friends say we could see some rain in Oregon in the next 36 hours. Oil+road grime+fresh rain can mean slick conditions. Use caution.
4320 2018-08-02 15:41:18 Market Update: price increase. 

So far today Heating Oil and Gas Oil have increased by a large amount, both have increased by nearly 0.9PPL and has constantly been rising from 11am today.

4338 2018-08-02 15:40:15 Carbon tax adds up to a dime, depending on the province.  We (Govt of Canada) literally purchased a pipeline to move construction forward. How is Government responsible for oil companies price gouging?

4347 2018-08-02 15:39:32 Well of course he is and agreeing with Putin to keep gas prices high enough for both countries to profit only means more money in their pockets. We don't need to be polluting more. Our current regulations seem to work I can pull my boat just fine. Oil companies are evil.

There is no motivation to reduce consumption. But for this we will not need an entire environment department. #WalkAway

4395 2018-08-02 15:34:39 The oil in the capsule is identical to an edible and I find it more iffy. I like how discrete it is but I get a very different high vs vaping and a much higher chance of unwanted side effects or a loopy high like you described. BUT different strains act differently, which helps!
4396 2018-08-02 15:34:38 Why is it stupid ? It’s why Trunp won. Honestly the media slant and the way the left speaks to and about the right (and middle for that matter ) pushed folks away... baskets of deplorables and the clinging to their guns and bibles talk isn’t a good strategy

4405 2018-08-02 15:33:32 #My bone doctor was seen by me to tell my having fallen from the cot

I had treatment for having high-level sugar and some therapy for it

He re-examined via x-ray from front side and gave me costly calcium pill

He advised me not to put any oil or balm, no pain due to his advice

4407 2018-08-02 15:33:30 Mobil Oil Company's flying red horse lives on Wharf II's building, even though extreme attempts to eradicate were somewhat disappointing. May the flying red pegasus live on. The Dream Theater sign would look good on that building too. :)
4408 2018-08-02 15:33:29 @SearsHoldings  Hey Sears I'm going on your company website to apply for a job. I don't need to up load a resume to sell, and change tires or oil. No wonder you are going out of business. Resume LoL, hey it's your store do want you want
4409 2018-08-02 15:33:27 I think that the problems with Venezuela are (1) relying heavily on oil exports, and (2) being victimized by US economic warfare.
4410 2018-08-02 15:33:27 Gave up on Advil and went to CBD oil!  Works like a charm for pain after working out. I’m good without chemicals in my body...no prescription required. Screw Meloxicam and Advil.
4411 2018-08-02 15:33:26 Yah! I've used butter before but coconut oil much easier to work with :)

4413 2018-08-02 15:33:14 I usually vaporize the dried flower (aka what most people think of when they think of weed) in either a portable vaporizer or a desktop one (Airizer Air or V-Tower) because I don't mind the smell. My other intake method is softgel capsules which are just oil in a capsule.
4414 2018-08-02 15:33:06 Or weed oil
4415 2018-08-02 15:33:00 Seeing wat Saudi Arabia and Qatar did with their crude oil money makes me wonder whether Nigeria is selling Coconut oil.
4416 2018-08-02 15:32:55 I put steel reserve in my oil diffuser to unwind after a hard day of work.
4417 2018-08-02 15:32:54 Anyone got coconut oil I can borrow?
4418 2018-08-02 15:32:51 Agree plus some bad decisions by CY. There is a need however for some good news in Middle East and one less problem. There is the oil benefit too.
4419 2018-08-02 15:32:51 @Tesla @solarcity @elonmusk IMO installing new Solar roof tiles w/ Tesla cars & chargers & batteries in Buildings in front of Congress & WH would go a long way to educate the "Oil&Gas&Coal&Nuclear Donations only" elite in DC.@POTUS :15% from your 63 m. voters likes the Sun+Wind
4420 2018-08-02 15:32:37 i smell like amber oil what a cute smell
4421 2018-08-02 15:32:33 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
4422 2018-08-02 15:32:27 Correction: 506 kuwaitis died, 711 prisoner in 7 months and 600 oil wells been burned.

4424 2018-08-02 15:31:55 Tough pills to swallow: Fish oil.
4425 2018-08-02 15:31:54 Actually science does point to the Bible. If you examined the fault line that we currently mine for oil soak, you would see a huge trilobite graveyard. This graveyard formed when the foundations broke after the ice was broken that was above
4426 2018-08-02 15:31:47 Well, I worked 31 years in LE, retired and now have to go back to work because they pulled my health insurance. So shit happens Charlie.

4438 2018-08-02 15:30:14 Time to apply the same monopoly buster as was applied to Standard Oil.
4439 2018-08-02 15:30:12 Starting to get into a zone where I would "think" (dangerous when I do that) this should cool off for a bit here.

But, it's oil, so....

4443 2018-08-02 15:29:53 NOT ENOUGH OLIVE OIL
4444 2018-08-02 15:29:47 Try a salad without lettuce: garbanzo beans, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, avocado, olive oil, lemon &amp; pepper. Mmmm
4445 2018-08-02 15:29:47 Bug just found out I use a shower oil, mostly sunflower and coconut oils, and he won’t stop licking my legs.
4446 2018-08-02 15:29:39 This was from a hangout from my Google plus account, I have a widow of a Philippines oil and gas company who is dying herself. She is or was on Twitter, once to give me 15 million dollars if I promise to donate  50% of it to charity. seems legit. 
4447 2018-08-02 15:29:21 "Productivity isn't about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil.... It's more about priorities, planning, and fiercely protecting your time." - Margarita Tartakovsky
4448 2018-08-02 15:29:21 This is dumbest thing I have heard in awhile. Have you ever watched either? Jim Acosta is a Journalist, who does objective news. Hannity is a snake oil salesman who runs an opinion show. 1 held to standards, the other not, can you guess which one? Fucking moron
4449 2018-08-02 15:29:10 LOL we all know the Trump admin isn't doing it because of safety they're doing it so that 1.) Their wealthy owners don't starve their funding by making requirements tougher and 2.) Keep oil in demand and expensive so their other wealthy owners don't starve their funding.
4450 2018-08-02 15:29:08 They went in for democracy and turned it into living HELL.
Life was better under gaddafi’s ruling with free gas/electricity, free healthcare, $5k for new born baby $50k for newly wed new house and the list goes on. Guess the Oil for the west played the Dictator card?.
4451 2018-08-02 15:29:04 Fab, love tomatoes with fresh basil, rock salt, splash of oil and mozzarella.  Yummy xx
4452 2018-08-02 15:29:02 Big money just feels like a buzzword that’s absolutely meaningless while that money is needed to fund the little things that make campaigns work. 

I’ve yet to find many Dems beholden to groups or companies to an iota of the extent of the GOP and the NRA or oil companies.
4453 2018-08-02 15:28:52 CBD oil bro. Helps out with having to put any thc in ur system.
4454 2018-08-02 15:28:50 No thanks, I'll just have the regular old whore olive oil
4455 2018-08-02 15:28:48 It’s a pain in the ass. Most of us don’t fry regularly, so oil can go off between. Best to store in air tight jar, in a dark cabinet.
4456 2018-08-02 15:28:30 Societé Generale 1/3: The US is seriously considering a 25% tariff on $USD 200bn of imports from China and while $USDCNY is treading water around the year's highs, Asian equity indices had a bad day and raw material (as well as oil)  prices are softer.
4457 2018-08-02 15:28:24 War to protect the export of oil. Im sorry i realize i worded that poorly, and yes we would, we'd be fighting Canadians if our oil trade with them was threatened. A nation runs on oil after all.
4458 2018-08-02 15:28:18 Prager U is largely funding by Billionaires from the Fracking industry. Every time I have seen a “credible” counter argument to global warming, I see funding from the oil industry. Coincidence?
4459 2018-08-02 15:28:16 O my God sorry 4u.Did u think this GEJ era no more swapping of crude oil for refined products. The 4refinery in Nigeria can't even produce 30% of local consumption.we import almost every pmb,diesel,kerosene etc dat we consume
4460 2018-08-02 15:28:08 "Studies have shown that the pomegranate fruit as well as its juice, extract, & oil exert anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative & anti-tumorigenic properties by modulating multiple signaling pathways, which suggest its use as a promising chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent."
4461 2018-08-02 15:28:07 All refined oils are inflammatory including olive oil. Eat the whole olive instead. (sans the pit) ;-)
4462 2018-08-02 15:28:02 
4463 2018-08-02 15:27:57 Either everyone sells their oil, or no one does. Iran has the capability to do this and the Americans know this," Naghavi-Hosseini , #Iran Parliament Commission spokesperson
4464 2018-08-02 15:27:47 I just changed my oil for my car almost fucking died out there it’s so fucking hot
4465 2018-08-02 15:27:46 Sigh. China needs an independent Iran
Today Iran is China’s (1 oil importer) best non-USA (/Saudi) and non-Russia oil source
Tomorrow it’s a nat’lly sovereign, navy-proof oil IV b/w Persian Gulf and Belt+Road
W/o Iran, USA+Russia can send China back to Qing at will

After that we roll right into a two day oil leak repair on a Mercedes Benz Diesel. 

How might we be of service to you today? Call us at 919-881-0364!
4471 2018-08-02 15:27:07 (I am kinda serious about not really knowing what to do with a massive amount of fry oil leftover afterwards, should I actually fry stuff.)

4474 2018-08-02 15:26:29 I honestly can’t believe people are *still* fighting over the Bernie-Hillary thing, blaming Hillary for Trump, lol! Russia would’ve tweaked the results no matter *who* was winning. They needed Trump to access Exxon’s oil tech. IT’S ALWAYS been about $$ and exposing oligarchy.
4475 2018-08-02 15:26:11 Sunflower butter, eating a spoonful of coconut oil right before bed. It might take you a few years but then fat cells can get fattened up enough for them to transfer it with the proper diet, oh and eating an avocado or some form everyday.
4476 2018-08-02 15:26:05 Try Tea tree or eucalyptus oil
4477 2018-08-02 15:26:04 Because I am an oil executive and want people to buy more of my gas, I fully support NO fuel economy standards.

4480 2018-08-02 15:25:43 What he’s always been. A fake, money and power hungry snake oil salesman.
4481 2018-08-02 15:25:39 You haven’t experienced absolute disgust until you take fish oil on an empty stomach and burp up low tide an hour later.
4482 2018-08-02 15:25:24 Yeah. Might help! I read that it could be excess oil building up below the skin but honestly I know so little about it.  If a few months of my new products don't work I might have to go back to the prescription! Good luck

4485 2018-08-02 15:24:50 Ah yes, can you, a man, please explain to me, a woman, how misogyny works. Clearly my simple mind just can’t possibly understand!
4486 2018-08-02 15:24:50 You didn't answer my question. Actually "fly off of you disagree" position is ashamed in Russian anti-Putin opposition community for a good reason. Russian gov. doesn't need our taxes almost at all, it has oil. Opposition activity makes bigger effect.
4487 2018-08-02 15:24:49 They said Jonathan government PDP looted Nigeria for six years in power with small infrastructure which I see.
My question is where and what happened to the money Nigeria has been getting from oil and other revenues for over fourth years 
North has been in power
4488 2018-08-02 15:24:48 Iran is Fabulous Country, I lived there for 6 years. Why do you Sanction them? The people are fabulous, infinitely more hospitable than Americans! I built an Oil Refinery in Isfahan, 3 Billion USD. I was downtown Tehran and heard on Iraq declaring War on them! Fucking Rumsfeld!!
4489 2018-08-02 15:24:39 I tolong jawabkan: try to double cleanse with cleansing oil/ balm & then followed with facial cleanser. Proper cleansing is important to clean up the pores.
4490 2018-08-02 15:24:39 Jide omokore , Aluko and oil goddess Alison Made an oil deal of #1 trillion and chose not remit to Nigeria Government under GEJ. And you come out to talk to Nigerian about unemployment after taking what belong to all Nigerian for yourself and friends.

4493 2018-08-02 15:24:15 To bad big oil still sells fuel to Greenpeace Think it would solve a lot of problems if they couldn't buy fuel for their fleets of boats
4494 2018-08-02 15:24:15 It’s become clear that much of the GOP base is more interested in white identity grievance politics than in your economic message, and has a distinctly un-American taste for authoritarianism. You need to acknowledge that, and address the snake oil salesman selling it to them.
4495 2018-08-02 15:24:14 Soy oil does
4496 2018-08-02 15:24:13 Newer, better, cuter, with a premium priced service included that both delivers new and takes away old oil.
4497 2018-08-02 15:23:42 A true climate plan would mean the phased shutting down of the Tarsands as renewables take the place of oil and retraining of the people to clean up jobs or renewables. 
A true climate plan would include measures to protect species from extinction like our Southern resident orca.
4498 2018-08-02 15:23:09 And what about all the Saudi or Venezuelan or Russian or all other oil that u are replacing Alta oil with? Is it just Alta in ur mind that's the problem. Answer, Tides has brainwashed u well

4518 2018-08-02 15:20:13 The greenhouse gases that were added to the atmosphere between 1990 and 2017 are now trapping 450,000 GJ of extra solar heat in Earth's system every second.

That's the amount of heat you'd get from burning 75,000 barrels of oil. Per second.

4535 2018-08-02 15:17:50 @GoldmanSachs 1/2: We are overweight currencies from oil-exporting countries such as Russia and Norway that have not experienced the same degree of appreciation as oil prices over the past year.

And rushing medicine to market without full clinical trials can also kill a lot of people either directly or indirectly.
4542 2018-08-02 15:17:05 If you researched the problem is related to the capital right offs they can do which btw was set up by an ALP government after the last oil shock. It was meant to encourage exploration and development of O&G. Great work ALP another screwed up policy.
4543 2018-08-02 15:16:58 To destroy the environment and increase the profits of Big Oil?  You are correct!

4545 2018-08-02 15:16:51 Is this the only way you can frame "Hey guys, we're going to reduce how many miles per gallon new cars will get so you can buy more gas and burn more oil and cause more pollution" to get your base to rally behind it? "Unravels more of the black guy's legacy"

"An olive has to go through three stages, for its oil to run..the shaking, beating, and the pressing..And just like the olive, some of you may have felt like that.. You've went through all of that for your oil to flow
Now, your greater is coming"


4550 2018-08-02 15:16:14 Getting my oil changed and a lovely lady named Dianne Smith sparked up a conversation with. This convo lasted well over an hour and she showed me how strangers can be so loving and kind if we just allow the opportunity to happen.
4551 2018-08-02 15:16:09 Really? I ate a hot dog and drank some coffee with coconut oil in it, and now my throat is no longer sore? Really??? My body is weird..
4552 2018-08-02 15:16:04 You are quoting a work of fiction. I would say you have already been duped. The only oil I am concerned about isn't the kind used to annoint. If the seals are broken and heaven's fury rains down, I will be a remnant, but I don't deal in faith.
4553 2018-08-02 15:16:04 The liquid to oatibix ratio is absolutely unreal, you need about a litre of milk per biscuit...where does it go, how does it do it, you could soak up an oil slick with 1 box easily!!

4555 2018-08-02 15:15:43 As long as POS can allow Corporations and Big Oil to do as they please, it’s a big FU to all of us, our children and all future generations. Oh and undoing anything Obama touched. Vote them all out!!
4556 2018-08-02 15:15:32 The demand for consumer durables, automobile and B2B are soaring high. A major real consumption driven boom coming in Indian economy..expect GDP numbers going higher. Oil prices shock well absorbed. June 2018 quarter numbers are highly encouraging. Stock markets creating new high
4557 2018-08-02 15:15:30 And they are also a factor in doubling the MPG on vehicles. If you think the auto industry does stuff because they want to then you are an idiot. They do stuff they are made to. 
Keeping the CAFE will help reduce our dependency on oil both foreign and domestic.

4572 2018-08-02 15:14:08 Very important; there are many other factors than the oil that have gotten us where we are. Gender equality is one, with parental leave and good daycare. And yes, in case you wonder, og is possible still to get rich.

4578 2018-08-02 15:13:17 Government bond prices ended lower today as traders booked profits after sharp rise in prices yesterday. Prices rose earlier as an overnight fall in oil prices eased fears of inflationary pressures. Sentiment improved after RBI policy statement eased fear of future rate hikes.

4585 2018-08-02 15:12:51 I know sometimes when I see snake oil being sold at gyms and wellness centers I wish I could turn off my brain and morals and just pay off student loans

4588 2018-08-02 15:12:47 The rule I’ve only seen which someone posted in about riders not being able to let oil drop in the pits. Nothing about oil bring on the track. You could be right tho....I’ve been told that Wolverhampton Somerset and stoke have used oil. They could of used it on non race nights.

4609 2018-08-02 15:11:01 that's just housing.  Cars, health care, public transportation, air travel, restaurants, etc.  have all gone through the roof. It'll be interesting to see how oil reacts to the jobs report tomorrow. I know I am in the minority but I expect it to dissapoint.
4610 2018-08-02 15:10:56 Lubricant or machine oil maybe. Wouldn't be that much to lose down the pipes before you get a failure tho. Did you contact maintenance?

4625 2018-08-02 15:09:01 Terribly tragic and hopeless! Lots of facts so I saved the link for iPad consumption later. The 70s were pivotal. Demand for petroleum collided with environmental concerns. Oil production in US went negative in 1968. The 1st Earth Day was in 1970. Middle East tensions in mid-70s.
4626 2018-08-02 15:09:01 We could put solar on houses, warehouses, office buildings, in fields in the east. Mix this with wind and voila we have 100% renewable. We can then export more gas/oil/coal and we'd be set. I have solar, I love it. I produce extra every day.
4627 2018-08-02 15:09:01 Dunking on? I think you’re using that colloquialism wrong. Anyway, the guy is great. Fighting for species survival means he gets a lot of hate from republicans, big oil, short sellers, and sadly, the #antithought crowd of liberals who enjoy taking the counterpoint on EVERYTHING.

4630 2018-08-02 15:08:49 They do repeatedly, only they say nothing of any substance, like you it's rhetoric, platitudes, faith and belief, snake oil.
4631 2018-08-02 15:08:48 The last time he used terms like this, it was "macro event" back before when the oil price drop happened from the 100-range to 30s in 2014-16.  It was almost like he has wall-streeter honchos feeding him up-coming issues.  2015 was a lull in EV growth (drop in USA sales).

4668 2018-08-02 15:04:55 I need to take my A8L to the shop. Need a oil change and some maintenance . The spaceship need some TLC lol

4670 2018-08-02 15:04:49 Koretz, my councilmember, signed that #BrownsLastChance letter demanding that the state phase out oil production. So he better get busy with those safety solutions for this ghg-free transpo. Regs don’t write themelves.
4671 2018-08-02 15:04:45 What kind of food do you usually feed her? I'm thinking of feeding some coconut oil (been reading about its health benefit for cats) to one of mine coz she's quite skinny and fussy with eating.

4679 2018-08-02 15:04:26 Between Tesla’s earnings call discussing plans for plants in China increasing productions despite new tariffs, to this Trump administration freeze on the fuel efficiency standards, the oil industry’s relationship with the future of the automobile industry is juxtaposed.
4680 2018-08-02 15:04:17 You are very ornery this morning. You need some swing oil.
4681 2018-08-02 15:03:58 Exactly! Imagine the reality show shithead "running" our country doing anything remotely artistic. I'll take a poet over a snake oil salesmen any day of the week.

4689 2018-08-02 15:02:56 To be honest, here’s my biggest burning question about #LoveIsland (yes I know it’s over but I’m halfway through and NOT GIVING UP): 

With all the contestants’ fake tan, foundation, body oil, eye makeup, and “doing bits”, how do they keep those bedsheets so pristinely white?!?!
4690 2018-08-02 15:02:53 Neither can your snake oil salesman pitch be sold to enough people. Call your "peoples vote" what it is - a 2nd referendum. Again, if we had such a vote and remain won, do you think 17.4 m will simply bow down? What you call for is highly dangerous road to go down. Disgraceful!

4695 2018-08-02 15:02:24 #CRUDE OIL - Holds 100 day moving average and bounces big time. 66.93 is the 100 day and the low was 66.92.  Next support from there lies at 66.29, the low from 7/18. 68.52 is yesterday's high, looks like an outside day to the upside in the making. Big resistance at 70.50ish.

4699 2018-08-02 15:02:09 Sigh. Average incomes in Alberta have to do with the oil industry. Years of conservative governments in Alberta have squandered Albertans' birthright on low taxes, high provincial debt, and deficits. Without oil, Alberta would be a 'have not' province.

4703 2018-08-02 15:01:38 What has oil prices got to do with loss of jobs in the banking industry or manufacturing industry of companies closing down? You need to think outside the box. PDP years were not perfect, but we had 7.9million jobs safe and people could feed their families.

4715 2018-08-02 15:00:24 Oil prices just dropped. Predictions are not facts. Since @fordnation took office gas has gone up 5 cents. The promise wasn’t “to reduce the prediction price” but the ACTUAL price. In any event, the 10 cent reduction was to come from less tax on gas. These taxes ate still there!

4739 2018-08-02 14:58:05 Rolling back CAFE will have bad economic, environmental, and energy security effects: 1) more pain for US drivers when oil prices rise, 2) more GHGs, 3) while Trump admin. says it wants energy "dominance," rolling back CAFE is surest ways to ensure US reliance on imported oil.

4757 2018-08-02 14:56:16 It was a semi rhetorical question. People don’t use olive oil for long frying because of how it behaves. Rapeseed or sunflower might be a safer/longer lasting thing choice. I know home-frying with olive oil requires some attention or it smokes.

4802 2018-08-02 14:52:01 So what - carbon dioxide is plant food.  1.6% (Canada) x 4% (oil Sands) x 4% industry global) = 0.000%.  We should charge for the carbon dioxide used by our boreal forest, not pay!
4803 2018-08-02 14:52:00 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil....
4804 2018-08-02 14:51:51 Can’t wait to take my Jeep back to the place that repaired my engine for the next oil change. Then when they tell me I have an oil leak I can look at them and say “well you repaired my engine, whatcha gonna do about it?! ” #carssuck
4805 2018-08-02 14:51:49 Well that was extremely funny. #roscomcclelland stand up @Gildedballoon. I survived the interactive show wearing my Marvin Gaye t shirt and didn’t get the piss taken.  Good owl, dog, hobby and @NewForthBridge gags.  But the highlight was baby oil
4806 2018-08-02 14:51:49 USA's military assets have been, are being, used by global Big Oil corporations since oil was first discovered in the Mideast like the US military was/is their personal army. Globalist corporations are running, have always ran, the show. Better deal: Mideast harvests its own oil~

4814 2018-08-02 14:51:06 - I'm tired of living in a boom/bust economy that's a slave to the price of oil. We need to protect our economy by diversifying
-  In the (not too) distant future, we won't be able to find as many buyers of our oil b/c it's expensive to extract and ship. Renewables will overtake

4823 2018-08-02 14:50:24 Do not use Parkway Oil - had them replace 3 thermostats at $155 each. Found out the thermostats only cost $25. We trusted a company we’ve been dealing with for years to give us a good thermostat. They gave us a cheap, non-programmable thermostat. Calls to office are not returned.
4824 2018-08-02 14:50:18 Today just feels like a reversal day. Like something is about to come out. Dollar gets slammed, inflation currencies rip, bonds reverse up, stocks reverse down, oil reverses back down. Let's see.

4828 2018-08-02 14:50:03 not me kicking off about it. sooner we get rid of dead wood the better and we'll keep the oil. boss
4829 2018-08-02 14:50:02 Or just like, how can one call it a history?  The article really lost me with its U.S.-centric view. The whole bit about the oil companies being helpful is super ridiculous as well. Setting aside money externally is not the same as being on board.

Bad things: I CAN'T SLEEP WITH THAT GREASY FEEL IN MY SKIN

4835 2018-08-02 14:49:25 Good, thoughtful question.

For ME, I have known about Donald Trump since the 80s. He's always been a snake oil salesman.

But many people only know him from the Apprentice, and shockingly find him trustworthy. And even more surprisingly, TRUST V. PUTIN!

Shocking times.

4843 2018-08-02 14:48:54 Look on the bright side! Gas might be a few pennies cheaper so we can travel to the smog-enshrouded cities and visit the oil well and "clean coal" mines in what used to be national parks. 

Just like a trip back to the 1960's!

2) End Exon Mobil oil deal sanctions.
3) End Magnitsky Act.
4) Free reign in Ukraine/Crimea.

Black castor oil is made from roasting the castor beans & allowing ash deposits into the final product. It’s not bad quality, just not better than cold-pressed.

4901 2018-08-02 14:43:17 The media (half of which is effectively propaganda) gave us Brexit and Trump. All snake oil sellers play on desires and fears, and it takes someone to point out the snake oil is useless (or much worse). This the non-partisan media failed to do.
4902 2018-08-02 14:43:11 We also are rich on oil, but instead of selling it off to other nations and use renewables here, we stick to 20th century technology. There are allot of things Norway does well, we could do here.
4903 2018-08-02 14:43:10 Don’t be afraid of oil :

                     • coconut oil
                     • rose hip oil
                     • avocado oil

4904 2018-08-02 14:43:03 No, he has not admitted socialism has failed. He said the "production models we've tried so far have failed." His solution: increase oil production - not embrace economic freedom. Doubtful the Venezuelan people have learned. Likely they blame the Yanquis for their failure.

#2 dramatic drop in extreme poverty (living on <$2/day), was 90% of population at time of first oil well, now 10%. #OOTT
4933 2018-08-02 14:40:35 The Trump Administration has just announced that they will prioritize lining the pockets of big oil over protecting our right to breathe clean air, by rolling back our country’s fuel economy standards.

4935 2018-08-02 14:40:15 Canadians were sold on "climate action" because they figured the other guy (e.g. Big Oil/Biz) was going to take the biggest hit. Now they realize their own livelihoods are at stake, & their favourite pastimes (like RV/boating) & heating the house are getting really expensive.
4936 2018-08-02 14:40:13 U.K. had oil revenues but not sure how they were spent, Twitter over to you

4945 2018-08-02 14:39:18 @realDonaldTrump The planet is burning up and you want to rollback emission standards for cars? What’s the point of being able to burn more oil if the planet is wiped out. We need to stop consuming oil before it kills all of us!

4947 2018-08-02 14:39:04 I'm the citizen that called into a open line during BP oil spill  and told the young Lady that buidg pumps can be reversed to vacuum up surface water's . That's not the end , public opinion went through the roof . So BP Got Lucky in the court of public opinion !!!

Relatively mild differences

4954 2018-08-02 14:38:16 Let me ask you a question
Iraq has oil
Who do you think should benefit from that oil?
If you answered the Iraqi people
Why do you think that the American people deserve less?
But OUR resources are owned by a handful of Corporations
We could live tax free & pay for HC

Also, don’t get confused. I think this is about the oil industry not the auto industry. 

They want oil usage to go up not down.

As a rule, yes, although some Omega-6 are ok and anti-inflammatory, eg. Evening primrose oil.  Good fats:  Fish oil, olive oil, flaxseed, avocados and nuts.  Bad:  Excess saturated fats, meat, dairy, veg oils, hydrogenated oils.

4995 2018-08-02 14:34:14 why hasn't another automaker from the 20th century partnered with a big oil company to give away free energy for every car bought ?
4996 2018-08-02 14:34:00 The weak performance Exxon'a stock is a good example that it is coming if the oil industry does not fit asap

5006 2018-08-02 14:33:02 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
5007 2018-08-02 14:32:57 like oil and gas has been a good investment in the last couple years no thanks
5008 2018-08-02 14:32:55 Especially since the American auto industry made a comeback after adjusting to fuel efficiency. But this is about the oil industry.

5015 2018-08-02 14:32:40 Letting the market take care of itself would result in car companies taking shortcuts in production, and oil companies charging more for gas that you’d have to fill up more often. Companies win, consumers lose. That’s what Trump wants because they donate to him politically
5016 2018-08-02 14:32:39 Oil companies and auto manufacturers both better off if R&D and innovation continue to make use of oil and gas products (a) more energy efficient and (b) cleaner. This has always been true, but never more than today. Progress since 1960s remarkable; more needed. Adapt or die.

5044 2018-08-02 14:28:59 Perhaps. But as you’ve repeatedly pointed out, China et al only got serious about de-dollarizing when their CBs stopped adding USTs in 2014, four years ago.

OBOR announced 2013, Yuan oil contract unveiled this year. Things have been remarkably piecemeal. What does that tell you?

5067 2018-08-02 14:25:53 Cows (and humans) produce methane. However, recent studies have shown that that % of methane produced by cows pales in comparison to shale drilling, landfills, etc. It is absolutely insignifant. We've blamed cows on what the oil and gas industry has created.

5080 2018-08-02 14:24:45 In 1979 & 1980, our college said that their large tuition increases were due to higher energy prices. It was true that the price of crude oil doubled in this time, however ...

5091 2018-08-02 14:24:03 Good times coming for oil services/offshore drillers? :)
5092 2018-08-02 14:24:01 America is in self-destroy mode. Only when it collapses into the ocean will some realize the oil & gas industry caused our demise. The question now is how much time do we have? One thing for sure, it won't be pretty.
5093 2018-08-02 14:23:57 Irrelevant.  Your firm's inability to separate product from finance is a toxic theme in West Coast investing.

I'm a big proponent of getting off of oil; however, I don't see this charlatan @elonmusk as much more than a petulant % defensive 19th C circus barker w/ a capital base.

5096 2018-08-02 14:23:48 Revenue per outlet based on an average right? So one KFC outlet could have its head in boiling oil, while another has its feet in the fridge and on average they are doing just fine.
5097 2018-08-02 14:23:41 This is the most annoying tired-ass thing to say...but I was suffering with bad skin for MONTHS starting last year. I tried everything to fix it, including chemical peels (!!) the ONLY thing that worked was moisturizing using a neutral oil and adding a few drops of tea tree oil
5098 2018-08-02 14:23:36 China created a highway though loans & infrastructure with key Oil producers to be able to buy Oil with Yuans by pegging the Yuan to gold made this possible. The West believes that only Russia, Venezuela & Iran would be the ones selling Oil per Yuans.

5103 2018-08-02 14:23:04 Sure, why not... Trump want's to get rid of medical insurance requirements so that (1) return to ER as primary care (cost to insurance/hospitals/consumers), and (2) lower fuel efficiency to increase cost of ownership (lower furl economy, more refueling and oil company profits).

5110 2018-08-02 14:22:37 No. Come on, this is embarrassing.
Learn some economics.
High oil prices would be the result of inflation (an increase in money supply versus goods/services). It is the symptom, not the cause of inflation.

But the need is urgent, before we're told it's too late.
5201 2018-08-02 14:13:49 The refinery wasn't stationed in katsina because of PMB but because niger is closer to katsina and the crude oil that will be supply to d refinery will come frm niger because some parts of d country has crude. The contract was very open and transparent.

SHAVING TIME 
- avoid pressing down hard with the razor
MOISTURIZE, MOISTURIZE AND MORE MOISTURIZE!!!

5216 2018-08-02 14:12:00 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec  “Trump administration revokes Obama-era fuel economy standards” This helps oil and automobile corporations rather than everyday Americans.  Did your base really sign off on this? This goes hand in hand with steel tariffs raising the cost of cars.
5217 2018-08-02 14:11:53 2/2 It just equates to higher profits for oil companies.

5221 2018-08-02 14:11:23 Norway is rich because it was lucky in finding oil, AND they had the foresight to know what to do with their newfound wealth. The latter is key. The country was poor half a century ago.

5225 2018-08-02 14:11:10 Sioux Nation, thank you for keeping up the fight! Polluting of our waterways affects not only Native Americans, but ALL Americans. I will take clean unpolluted water over cheaper gas prices any day. Cheaper transportation of crude oil doesn't equate to cheaper gas at pump. 1/2

5231 2018-08-02 14:10:23 You do know that the oil sector may never be what it was before, right? Our neighbours to the south have a vastly larger work pool that they can pay less as well as their new strategy of being self sufficient will heavily effect our oil business. The good times are over in oil.

5366 2018-08-02 13:56:22 it's the pickup truck death... everyone must have a pickup truck or...else. Money trap has sprung, no escape. Consumer give, big oil and other culprits take, from the ground, the  environment and it's basically free stuff, after tax cuts.
5367 2018-08-02 13:56:09 It's a shame there is so much opposition to the pipeline. Getting oil to tide water would allow Canada to increase it's exports and provide more services for Canadians. It would help Canada against Trump's trade wars.

5379 2018-08-02 13:54:45 ZEC is a state program. To argue that they interfere with federal CAFE stds bc they "disincentivize" investment in fuel efficiency is an unprovable and ultimately outrageous argument given CAFE was designed to reduce oil consumption in the first place.

5418 2018-08-02 13:50:12 Then why is it that HRC and O never really stood up to Putin but T has been the harshest on Russia since Reagan? Putin wants a pipeline to Germany to transport oil, T wants Germany to buy their oil from us instead. HRC and O gave 20% of our uranium to Putin.

5424 2018-08-02 13:49:49 data is very valuable! it's the 21st century oil! but not valuable enough to afford a regulator soz
5425 2018-08-02 13:49:32 No you’re right. I should have told the government to simply stop buying stuff after 5 I clock or your brother should have told the oil industry “no oil business after five”. Fucking coastal elite shit right here.

5502 2018-08-02 13:42:46 I wouldn't call it a "Death Fund", but agree the official name "Government Pension Fund" is greenwashing the fact that this is money earned from destabilising the climate (which indeed kills). The common name "Oil Fund" at least keeps its dirty source in mind.

5505 2018-08-02 13:42:35 Poor fuel efficiency = consumers spend more $$ on gas.
More $$ on gas = bigger profits for big oil and gas.
Bigger profits for big oil and gas = bigger donations to Trump and his GOP buddies.

5508 2018-08-02 13:42:09 Shame ‘There Will Be Blood’ didn’t go by the  source book’s title: ‘Oil!'
5509 2018-08-02 13:42:01 Only few will understand that this is utter bullshit. I've seen quite established people thinking this was true. Most people can't distinguish the snake oil from reality in crypto.
5510 2018-08-02 13:41:50 Who the hell hates spaghetti?  I drink protein shakes with cooking oil and you want to complain about me making spaghetti?
5511 2018-08-02 13:41:31 i need a oil change.
5512 2018-08-02 13:41:31 For Kenyans to benefit from oil, costs must be kept to a minimum. If local leaders are then seen as the stumbling block that consistently stands in the way, we will all lose.

5518 2018-08-02 13:41:04 COT data is not a short term timing thingie but it says that long oil looks like a crowded traded.
5519 2018-08-02 13:41:02 You mean destroying our air and water by weakening the standards necessary for us to survive. Got it. Who are you whoring for, again? The coal and oil industries? Go burn in a tire fire.

5533 2018-08-02 13:40:04 If we are “winning” so much, why are people still outraged. Where is my bigger more beautiful healthcare? My tax cut should have made me financially free? Our drinking water should be crystal clear. Our oil should be making gas prices cheap. But these aren’t happening, are they?

5541 2018-08-02 13:39:11 This is why American cars are not competitive abroad, and gas guzzlers makes America more dependent on foreign oil.

5552 2018-08-02 13:38:31 I think the argument was relevance. Wizkid is relevant on the urban charts and to young people. Duncan is relevant to oil money port harcourt older people.  Wizzy has to always pop online. Duncan only has to be alive to pop in his market.
5553 2018-08-02 13:38:28 What a garden! I wish I had an oil painting of it. Where can I get or how can I get a high resolution version of this photo?

5555 2018-08-02 13:38:20 Coconut oil is life!
5556 2018-08-02 13:38:15 Yes, lets start a war with Iran to raise oil prices, add tariffs so cars cost more and reduce fuel economy. 
Guess who wins.
Corporations and the top 1% = GOP constituency.
5557 2018-08-02 13:38:12 He will choke us out of money, then of clean air and water. Worst president ever in history of universe. Only helps rich cronies, oil companies and Russian oligarchs. Someone with some power in government, please stand up to him and do something!

5561 2018-08-02 13:37:46 This would be a mistake by Iran. 

There's a covert coalition lead by the US and Saudis in the Middle East just itching to act upon any sign of agression by Iran.  

A small number of destroyers, 'icebreakers', and highly trained amphibious commandos will keep the oil flowing.
5562 2018-08-02 13:37:39 Bring more oil. I need oiling up
5563 2018-08-02 13:37:39 What’s your opinion on where oil prices are heading?

5566 2018-08-02 13:37:27 Actually, we do. Her life is so good, her political choices have no consequence. Her life will continue to be good regardless of whether Trump is president for 2 or 6 more years. That's why she has the latitude to "vote for Trump to own the libs/media." It's called privilege.

Let's hope there's enough Farage guaranteed 'cure all' Snake Oil to go round...
5572 2018-08-02 13:36:44 DOES Trump know anyone in the oil & gas industry. Are there any GOP who receive donations from that industry. Do they own shares in those industries? Dana bet they would profit at the expense of air quality, warming & technology AND YOUR WALLET!

5577 2018-08-02 13:36:06 This jackass just keeps getting dumber and dumber. He just does whatever Putin or Big Business tells him to. Yes, yes, let's decrease our fuel economy and further ruin our environment. Like Oil companies and Auto Companies need more money.
5578 2018-08-02 13:35:51 so the oil guys get to force us to dance to their tune and pay their price? there was 38 mpg in the 80s and then back to 12 and 20 NOT ok

5580 2018-08-02 13:35:51 2)  

spread government propaganda
via news outlets. [3]   

• Signed the Monsanto Protection Act into law. [4]

• Pushed for the TPP Trade Pact. [5]

• Did a TV commercial promoting "clean coal." [6]

• Opened up deepwater oil drilling, even after the BP disaster. [7]
5581 2018-08-02 13:35:47 There are also likely some impacts because of the boom in export of animal feed (pointing to the current China soy trade mess). Some soy exports are whole soybeans. Others are crushed soymeal. If you crush and press soy and export the meal, we're left with the oil in the US.
5582 2018-08-02 13:35:23 Why? 
Nothing is needed from fossil fuels. 
All machinery and transportation can olso be electric. Anything made from oil can be made from trees/plants.
5583 2018-08-02 13:35:09 White soup does not have oil nah.
5584 2018-08-02 13:34:57 Biggest suggestion is to make sure you’re changing out your coils pretty often. The CBD oil is way thicker than they’re used to and it burns up quickly. You’ll want a juice that’s a little thinner than your CBD, and then 50/50 shouldn’t kill the coils too fast

5588 2018-08-02 13:34:29 The system of checks and balances to hold each other accountable and work as a team for customer and employee safety is interesting to watch @Valvoline instant oil change Eastgate. Need this level for our teams.

5591 2018-08-02 13:34:06 Are you taking money from oil/gas firms now? Do you have some deep bias (your father worked on oil rigs in Alberta, right?)?  Trolling with this propaganda is very unbecoming of someone who professes to be a scientist and an intellectual.  Speak the truth and see what happens!
5592 2018-08-02 13:34:01 Like anything else with this corrupt #POTUS if you want to understand motive just ask yourself where the $ goes. 

In this case consumers and car manufacturers want higher efficiency vehicles. 

The only ones that don't are oil/gas corp. Wonder who they contribute to politically?

5595 2018-08-02 13:33:44 A gas field 1/4 the size of Wales, with a route to market already built.  At premium prices.   Add Morocco to that.  100MB of North Sea oil.  Tie in with Sarawak government.   Couple of million barrels in England.    Decent little company we have here?  #upl

5622 2018-08-02 13:29:53 Reading through the report it looks like the oil increase is because of the olive oil consumption boom along with an increase in french fries. Maybe more "vegetable oil" in packaged foods and baked goods as well, but that level of detail isn't there. Interesting.
5623 2018-08-02 13:29:49 Where do you see the oil field in 5-10 years? Feast or famine?

5631 2018-08-02 13:29:19 1. You wanna talk facts? She’s right. The oil is going to be drilled. If you or Bernie Sanders have a car, y’all should understand the current realities. But that doesn’t have to be our future. We need to build a transition to green energy. That takes time and political will.
5632 2018-08-02 13:29:11 OK, so we're now the world's single largest oil producer, YET our gas prices are near record highs. And President Von Clownstick thinks changing standards will do the trick?

Of course, @realDonaldTrump also thinks you need ID to buy groceries.

Have fun with FOX noise, Gateway Pundit, Breitbart and InfoWars.  They are giving you a false sense of security.

5650 2018-08-02 13:27:39 I'll get the big thing of peanut oil from bj's
5651 2018-08-02 13:27:32 Maybe, but since China is pushing regulations to get away from oil, those may force them to keep going since that’s a bigger market.
5652 2018-08-02 13:27:27 I'll say this.  Please don't listen to these pastors and faith leaders about politics.   Would you go to the dentist to get your car oil changed?
5653 2018-08-02 13:27:26 Random: I would like to read a history of the Nigerian migration to Houston. Like, why Houston? Is it an oil connection?

5661 2018-08-02 13:26:42 Seaspan has lots of trade jobs available in North Vancouver and oil economy is dead in Alberta. But they can’t find people who want to move because they can’t afford it $3 million house in North Vancouver and don’t want to commute for three hours from the Tri-Cities.

5665 2018-08-02 13:26:20 Where is the proof of what you are claiming as a increased revenue from when Oil & GAS WAS THE SAME PRICE BEFORE? my guess is revenue has gone down in direct comparison and costs have increased but net jobs and wages have gone down, meanwhile cost of living has increased #stupid

5669 2018-08-02 13:25:49 Diffusing lavender oil is supposed to help with sleep. Whenever I’m having a hard time falling asleep because my mind won’t shut off I turn on my diffuser and am usually out before I realize!

5671 2018-08-02 13:25:33 It will never matter Greta. The same way that they still poop on the streets in places like Morocco—and leave oil spills in the Mid East—we can show them the right way all we want—they will never change.

5673 2018-08-02 13:25:22 The post-Brexit tax on extra virgin olive oil may just be the wake-up call I desperately needed to stop this sick addiction

5675 2018-08-02 13:25:02 they are a rare breed you know. I think there are even a few 'twins' there.

5695 2018-08-02 13:23:00 A mistake: you forgot something or got something wrong. Negligence: you knew your action or lack of it presented risk but went ahead anyway. I spoke to BALPA about this and was told about an aircraft maintenance worker who had left the oil seals off both engines is a twin jet.

5705 2018-08-02 13:22:17 What kind of example are politicians showing to young people. It's shameful that you are advocating  if you don't like democracy throw a hissy fit to change it. No wonder all politicians are seen to be lower than snake oil salesmen on the morality table

5707 2018-08-02 13:22:10 There is one applicable benefit of capitalism here - its ability to allow demand to be created in a multitude of fields, incorporating game theory. Free markets would diminish effect of monopolistic reliance on oil, no?
5708 2018-08-02 13:22:05 If it was that simple then provinces that have never had oil and gas revenues should be able to balance their books no matter what oil prices do but they cant. What NDP think is the answer is to replace an industry with green jobs but you cant export solar  and hydro has a rang

5716 2018-08-02 13:20:41 (Erm guys. Try aura crafts charcoal soap bar. It really worked for me. Doesn't have salicylic acic but my skin doesn't high key hates me anymore. They even have a face oil for the same purpose, haven't tried it yet but about to. You can look into that as well.)
5717 2018-08-02 13:20:40 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5718 2018-08-02 13:20:39 Try some tea tree oil with the calamine.
5719 2018-08-02 13:20:20 Oil companies, the Gulf Arab states and Russia, of course. You know, the powers behind Trump's throne.
5720 2018-08-02 13:20:06 LOL I feel like that creature trying to plan sometimes. or to go out. it's been mostly mexican and asian foods since this started, in terms of going out. last night I made a tasty dish out of my own head--I softened half a vidalia in olive oil, added a bit of minced bacon...
5721 2018-08-02 13:20:00 I recently learned (from my friend Lulu the owl) that is is really bad to pet owls cos you transfer oil from your skin onto their feathers, which they can't process, and it makes them moult unnecessarily which is v stressful for owls
5722 2018-08-02 13:19:59 this would do wonders for the price of Russian oil, no?

5739 2018-08-02 13:17:57 The biggest challenge though is the sort of people that want to work for corporates are the least suited to reacting to what’s going on around them. Lack of internal capabilities mean that even if you can see the problem you still can’t turn the oil tanker
5740 2018-08-02 13:17:50 Castor oil does the things
5741 2018-08-02 13:17:45 Not pricing carbon is just another subsidy for oil and gas. If you want a level playing field let’s start there. A Green Carbon Tax is revenue neutral, not an expense for citizens.

5747 2018-08-02 13:16:41  just think , if Westminster had managed the oil industry properly ( like Norway ) we wouldnt have nearly 2 trillion in debt , did yer pal tell you that 
5748 2018-08-02 13:16:38 the person should be able to tell them about chemical analysis or tests on oil samples.

Rent goes up roughly 2% annually, hydro rates are through the roof, gas & oil prices are outrageous & you cut the 3% raise to 1,5%?! Can we say homelessness?!!
5839 2018-08-02 13:03:30 Yep, that's what I think, too. As oil becomes more scarce, there's only one way to go for the price of gasoline - up.
5840 2018-08-02 13:03:19 Correct.  Spoke to a pal yesterday who thought we could have made a go for it in 2014 when oil strong but certainly not now

5843 2018-08-02 13:02:49 that's exactly what they did here, you can buy Tilrays product that's 1:1 and has about 95% of olive oil in it for the price of 10ml of quality RSO. if you buy anything else, it's jail time :) decriminalization at its finest
5844 2018-08-02 13:02:48 I can live without palm oil but no Lemurs! That's not the kind of world we should be helping to create

5918 2018-08-02 12:53:09 Even if it wasn't against any regulation it is still that fact that is such a ridiculous scenario that's escaping so many. The bike can't dribble oil but you can empty a can of oil all over it  
5919 2018-08-02 12:52:53 did I ever tell you about that time I ate too many cashews and was leaking cashew oil for a day
5920 2018-08-02 12:52:44 Mild benefits for oil, maybe steel (heavier cars), Detroit itself doesn't want.  Mostly, it really is a matter of principle and ideology for the conservative movement, and sounds like good 'owning the libs' for the base on Fox.

5924 2018-08-02 12:52:18 Not changing you car engine oil every 3000 miles is like having #sex with a prostitut  and not using a #condom.
5925 2018-08-02 12:52:15 They're not savage.
5926 2018-08-02 12:52:07 It's a Long term positive back door entry into banking system ...

5927 2018-08-02 12:52:05 I live in Los Angeles. This sophistry in service to the automobile and oil industries will kill more people and drive more climate disruption. Electrify everything. Vote these reckless people out of power.

5931 2018-08-02 12:51:41 Sounds familiar. Nick gets 10 ml of fish oil and 3 Tbs of PB (pilling) for his SLO. I get the fatty parts of the pot roast & nick gets the lean.
5932 2018-08-02 12:51:34 I like them with some olive oil, salt and oregano. 

Not a fan of how they do them here.
5933 2018-08-02 12:51:29 They kicked out the foreign oil companies who had expertise in delivering their most valuable commodity & high prices & now they can’t do it themselves. Also Goldman Sachs keeps floating their bond market

5936 2018-08-02 12:51:03 Social media and religion mix as well as oil and vinegar in my opinion, but I have to say that sometimes God answers prayers subtly and sometimes he slaps you in the face with his answers to prayers, and leaves you reeling in awe at his power. #godisgood

5955 2018-08-02 12:49:09 It does work well, but be careful, it makes the tub slippery. Especially when you hop in next shower having forgotten about the baby oil, it lingers unless you scrub right after.

5974 2018-08-02 12:47:29 This must absolutely be part of the conversation. Ordinary consumers' (mine included) Scope 1 emissions are oil and natural gas extraction companies' Scope 3 emissions. Whether we fine oil companies or levy a carbon tax, it is us consumers that will be paying for it.
5975 2018-08-02 12:47:29 like to use basil with a few onions and some garlic sweated down, drop of white wine, then a whole load of pasta chucked in, covered in as much basil, olive oil, salt and pepper as you like. Also works well with a load of seafood thrown in, or probably chicken

5997 2018-08-02 12:45:09 We always end up with way too much every year. My 2 favorite uses are  slice a tomato, cover with mozzarella and chopped basil, sprinkle with olive oil, and grill until the cheese melts. And basil/mango salsa. You can also substitute it for cilantro in almost any dish
5998 2018-08-02 12:45:00 The dumb froggidy non providing evidence frog is confusing his hallucinations with facts. We all know that you and facts are like oil and water 
5999 2018-08-02 12:44:57 I myself haven't witnessed any oil at wolves and I go there every home meeting and stay after the meeting, however can't say the same for other clubs. All I will say is that in the rule book is states (apparently) that your not allowed to use oil to bind the track together 1/2

It may sound harsh, but if the people you keep in your circle are always negative, lazy, and don't have the same goals and aspirations as you, WHY ARE THEY IN YOUR CIRCLE?  Oil and water don't mix, separate yourself.

6149 2018-08-02 12:28:25 There are no guarantees in the oil and gas business. As has been observed many times in the past, an industry that cannot foresee a decline in prices — from about $100 in 2014, to about $30 two years later — cannot be trusted to know the future.

Traitor Trump is working with Russia, Suadi Arabia & the UAE to overthrow Iran & put in MEK in exchange for their oil and nuclear contracts for Trump. Trump told Putin he could send 60 more diplomats

Remember when Gowon said our problem was how to spend our oil money? Pls how's the failing education your problem? Everything rises/falls on leadership

- we've made no progress in 40 years
- yes Big Oil is evil but you use their product every day
- we need to throw everything at this, all solutions should be pursued
- we will probably fail bc we left it too late

6237 2018-08-02 12:17:08 I think we should try and focus on solar and green energy and stop relying on oil... we're really not doing much good to the environment
6238 2018-08-02 12:17:02 Ever notice that real medication go through rigorous testing (thus the known side-effects) and alternative "medicine" promise the world? Same snake oil bs from the Old West. Alternative "medicine" is just pseudoscience. Read about it
6239 2018-08-02 12:16:58 I don't understand the modern fake medicine wellness trend. Atleast the snake oil salesmen of the late 19th early 20th century were peddling tonics full of alcohol and heroin.

6257 2018-08-02 12:13:47 If you've got a lot of tomatoes just throw them in a big pot with olive oil (lots of them, cut up into chunks) on medium low, add lots of onion (chunks, slices). Add a couple of chicken breasts and let it cook down. Stir it around, flip the chicken and make sure it cooks through.

6261 2018-08-02 12:13:19 The only solution I see & even that is a remote one is, sullas losing the massive economic advantage they have by oil becoming redundant as a fuel.I really wish India goes full-blown electric & solar by '30.But then sullas will have a way to dominate that industry as well. Sigh !

6266 2018-08-02 12:12:35 Sounds more like it! Just like the electricity, trident, oil and of course the national debt I think we have a hell of a hand to play during negotiations. 
Was there ever a territory better placed to become independent? None I can think of.
6267 2018-08-02 12:12:24 Your claim "it has no fat content" is laughable as a document in your own name you claim the use of oil or butter for lubrication and it can be ~6 percent. Whether oil or butter it has to contain antioxidants.The mould release agent can be either DMPS or fatty acid.

6281 2018-08-02 12:11:22 I mixed oil, vegan sour cream, and black bean juice for the "egg" then plopped in flour, fried, and then also popped in oven for just a lil
6282 2018-08-02 12:11:09 Yeah but they weren’t there in 1788, so they can’t grok the irony. Nor can most people bcos over 40% are born overseas.

6308 2018-08-02 12:07:25 Did you know that pollution kills thousand of people  each year. Make children asthmatic and reduce overall life expectancy. If you love oil and coal so much you should try to live near a power plant or and oil refinery.

6481 2018-08-02 11:43:46 Great thing about all this oil money flowing into football is the setting up of academy's Worldwide.PSG City are building more and more academy's in developing nations that gives enormous opportunity for people who aspire to be a footballer from a 3rd World country too.

6487 2018-08-02 11:43:20 When I was young I remember my mother spending whole days with olive oil on her hair, her head wrapped in a towel. This was back when olive oil could only be bought in chemists & was used to soften ear wax - no one cooked with it!

6523 2018-08-02 11:37:09 Yes.Inflation at 2.4% is not much above target & while there are signs inflation could go slightly back up due to oil prices increasing & £ dropping a bit again,I think I'm right in saying normally you should wait until it actually happens before deciding to raise rates

6545 2018-08-02 11:32:10 Noting WCS oil falling to $32/barrel with Cdn Blends below $40 or a $27-$35 discount to WTI. Extensive maintenance at Indiana’s BP Whitting refinery which uses Canadian heavy leading to bigger slumps in WCS. Time to stop wasting time on the #TMX. It’s costing Canadians plenty

It's    still going to be creamy at that point, so I made thin patties and    baked them again in a frying pan with olive oil, at medium heat.

6626 2018-08-02 11:18:24 2/3:  Venezuela, the 6th richest oil producing nation in the world, has been completely destroyed by “””Socialism””” & it only took 3 years!!

6629 2018-08-02 11:18:06 A falacy. As the Dollar/oil matrix collapses so does the US industrial military complex making the world a far safer place. US hegemony of the last 100 years has seen global strife unparalleled. Its foreign policy of distablising regions purely to keep control must end.
6630 2018-08-02 11:17:47 Here's a good one. In the 1970s, Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Oil Minister, said: “The Stone Age didn’t end for lack of stone, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil”. #foresight
6631 2018-08-02 11:17:46 And keep fighting oil,and resource control

6639 2018-08-02 11:16:14 It is. On the one hand almost everything has palm oil, trying to figure out what doesn't is a real challenge. Then if you cant avoid it there's no real way where the palm oil came from or whether it was ethically sourced. There's a lot of corruption in #palmoil certification.

6641 2018-08-02 11:15:59 @ruthlesslambert did not complain about track on here for the racing surface, just about oil being put on after the meeting. The only one who complained was @doniversen. Brady Kurtz said the track was great and the quality of the racing supports that.

6664 2018-08-02 11:12:15 Because they are logistically placed to take advantage of the raw materials for heavy industry within the EU, something that our governments let go to pot in Britain in favor of a more service-based economy, we have coal,oil and we have steel, we can manufacture again!

6713 2018-08-02 11:04:02 And an explanation have been put out to why it’s been done, there’s no rule to suggest oil isn’t allowed on the track so what’s the problem.

6718 2018-08-02 11:03:39 And thank god the oil price is relatively weak.
6719 2018-08-02 11:03:24 Meanwhile, the cost to consumers of goods and services increases. Follow the oil prices, but hang on to your Social Security and Medicare.

6757 2018-08-02 10:56:59 How do you know it’s waste oil? You don’t. After speaking with some of the track staff the oil is being used after a meeting to help bind the current shale on track. Fair play for Robert highlighting it but If questions were asked before the post, there would have been no issues

6759 2018-08-02 10:56:19 We haven't improved our grid since we gained our independence, it's sounds bad considering we produce oil. Egypt however only just improved their grid since gaining independence in 1922

6767 2018-08-02 10:54:48 Looking at the data, #oilprice tumbles when #US oil production increases. It seems #Iran is conveniently being used as scarecrow to keep oil prices up when US wants to increase own oil production.

Lesson here - don't be a petrol-state.

6774 2018-08-02 10:53:28 Oil can be explained with science, 15 years olds study it in chemistry where I’m from. There is zero evidence for a global flood and a lot of evidence against one.
6775 2018-08-02 10:53:23 They'll blame American meddling and greedy oil companies.
6776 2018-08-02 10:53:14 That’s right, I know very well who the devil is. The devil is the one who wants to control the oil inthe Middle East and kills the children, women etc. just for its imperialist aims.
6777 2018-08-02 10:53:11 Whilst you claim the oil to be Scottish, UK will claim the oil to be British. You surely don't think Scotland will walk away with all the oil and none of the debt, do you?

6802 2018-08-02 10:48:45 ‘Fur’ oil is presumably benefiting from the trend! Is there really a distinction between free choice and fashion fads? The best thing to do is have self-confidence to decide what you prefer regardless of external pressures!

6807 2018-08-02 10:47:21 Isn’t it amazing how other countries with oil seem to thrive even in hard times and Scotland under UK rule don’t. Amazing really, such bad luck finding all that worthless oil 
6808 2018-08-02 10:47:11 car il est effectivement très clair que si on croit, comme la plupart des écolos dont ceux de la FI, et au 1. peak oil et à la 2. theorie du rechauffement climatique anthropique et à la 3. deuxième principe de la thermodynamique, alors le futur n'est pas si simple.

6876 2018-08-02 10:33:22 What Qatar & Saudi Arabia government did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria government is selling coconut oil.
6877 2018-08-02 10:32:48 People thought am rich due to the nature of work, some will even ask me about engine brake oil whereas my salary can't buy tokunbo spark plug...

Voi siete traditori.

6885 2018-08-02 10:31:27 I've never looked up SDS's for extracted OILS before; interesting. I didnt realize they needed a chemical analysis so I looked up Natural ROSE OIL. Yup.

6888 2018-08-02 10:30:52 they know there is no risk of pensions decreasing in value, services declining etc. It's win-win basically. Also, although the original capital comes from oil revenues, it has been diversified to include stocks, real estate etc., so it will keep growing even after oil runs out.

6893 2018-08-02 10:30:05 World has 25 Muslim countries, if they are so bad, why we are running with bowl to get oil? 49 countries produces oil, why don’t we go there? You need to grow, which is not possible with present mindset. When you started hating someone, life get disturbed your own.

6901 2018-08-02 10:27:51 When I saw tiny windows, my first thought was insulation. It’s a pretty cold climate, and heating fuel (wood, coal, oil, whatever) is expensive, Why let your heat out through large windows ?
6902 2018-08-02 10:27:43 Oil heaters are power hungry whores.
6903 2018-08-02 10:27:34 Have you been near a beach? Mineral oil was washed up around Scotland. Looks like soap but is dangerous for dogs.
6904 2018-08-02 10:27:30 @mrjamesob if we are beyond policy- if we agree that Corbyn has put forward these good solid policies, is that not enough, do you want a Blair? A snake oil salesman? This attitude towards charisma over conviction? Think bigger.

6910 2018-08-02 10:24:44 Hi Lyssie @dontcallmefred. Out of our current range I'd suggest our Emma's Shampoo Bar as it includes Jojoba Oil which is said to strengthen hair & can promote hair growth. The other ingredients will also condition. We do always say to try a few first to find which feels better.

6926 2018-08-02 10:21:59 Today I got a 1hr full body oil massage, pedicure with gel and individual eyelash extensions for 1700 baht which comes to around £40. I love Thailand.
6927 2018-08-02 10:21:52 Agree and palm oil is very high in saturated fat, so it's not good health wise either.

- it's not your fault it's Big Oil and the GOP
- renewables will solve everything
- only mention nukes reluctantly
- don't say scary shit or go all doomerish
- end with upbeat message

7015 2018-08-02 10:07:12 Thank the gods that @seanhannity at least admits he is not a @journalist but just another snake oil salesperson. Know people by the company that they keep

7037 2018-08-02 10:03:16 Petro-geologists and petro-chemists were convinced that oil was a "fossil fuel” created by ancient decaying biological debris. oil companies had no financial interest in explaining to the people that abiotic oil was a natural product made on a continual basis deep within earth.

7052 2018-08-02 10:00:23 The Abiotic theory is an interesting and controversial idea. German chemists unlocked secrets of how oil is formed. Germany had resolved to develop enough synthetic oil to wage war successfully, even without abundant national oil reserves.

None have been anything except a strategic power move—for wealth, arms, control or oil. That's what your "troops" die for, and that's what broad, undefined "support" does.

7163 2018-08-02 09:37:21 I’d recommend your friend to just get some buds. Coconut oil or butter and make her own canna butter. Get the cookbook from @edibledee She has recipes and dosages . She will be able to control medicating herself better that way.
7164 2018-08-02 09:37:08 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
7165 2018-08-02 09:37:05 I followed you. Yes it is. After I saw your post about essential oil toxins & god there are so many things that the tiniest amount? Then we lose the one being that will never hurt us

7171 2018-08-02 09:35:21 The fact remains that we needn’t have to borrowed in the previous 14-16 years. The oil money was available but squandered. It doesn’t make sense to compare to different scenarios. This gov is not perfect but still better than the previous ones

7193 2018-08-02 09:31:41 That’s a shame. Did she know the strength of the oil. In California they show percent of THC per say chocolate and recommendations dosage. We are just far behind in terms of understanding how best to go about things

Do you know how much we’ve made from oil in the last 2 decades or how much we’ve pumped into generating power to no avail?

7220 2018-08-02 09:27:06 Hitler was a leftist. He ran a socialist agenda. They had state funded child care, medical care n many other things that ran through the state. My point is you can't be for big gov n be right wing that's like oil n water. The Nazi party was a left wing ideology.

7247 2018-08-02 09:22:03 You are being disingenuous?

Some were better positioned to avoid the shock of the tenfold price increase of an essential fuel and industrial feedstock over six years.

Added to the deeply toxic effect of British socialism

7270 2018-08-02 09:17:19 Ford, BMW, etc. Oil companies and ofcourse shorters all have a huge financial incentive to trash the company. ICE manufacturers have been doing very well with their polluting cars for decades.

7272 2018-08-02 09:16:06 the fact that americans add oil and water instead of butter and milk/cream to cake mix makes me want to barf. also the lack of eggs.

7278 2018-08-02 09:14:44 Well the cons could not balance the budget at 120 dollar oil. The ndp has had to deal with 20 dollar oil. They are dropping the deficit and cleaning up the infrastructure deficit created by years of neglect by the cons.

7324 2018-08-02 09:02:26 The year is 2040. We've all been fooled. The Earth is actually flat. The moon landing was fake. A huge supply of oil has been found so there's no longer a shortage of oil. Most important of all, ligma is an actual desease.

7359 2018-08-02 08:56:25 Few “hacks” which helped me a lot. Don’t cut out your fav foods. Swap olive oil with 1 cal spray oil, any fizzy drinks with zero sugar/ cal options and maybe cut back on alcohol midweek (if it applies)

7373 2018-08-02 08:54:42 It's a touchy subject here cause there are still the very few who want to remain as part of the UK but those who want independence are sick of what Westminster does to our country.

7532 2018-08-02 08:21:54 Okay, than it was like a revelation for you 
But I recommend to buy a can of compressed air without any oil. The keys are getting stuck by tiny crumps. It's nothing tragic, but it's annoying when you've nothing to clean.
7533 2018-08-02 08:21:49 Okayyyy, so those who died too benefitted from the treasury? And those unemployed, the street hawkers, AL majiris, widows, orphans too benefit from the money in circulation.

7604 2018-08-02 08:08:00 Oil Prices rose, steadying after losses over the past two days from a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories and renewed concerns over trade friction between the U.S. and China.

They have wonderful public services and low rates of inequality because their government have chosen to spend on public services and tax the rich. Any Sovreign Governmnet could do the same. Just down to choice. We had oil, made bad choices.
7711 2018-08-02 07:44:20 Firstly low oil price does not mean low fuel price, over 60% of the fuel price is taxed and not based on fuel. Removing most of those could drop the price to as low as R6 a litre. Sadly SA does need a proper stimulation package and this is what I meant my original tweet. To busy

7863 2018-08-02 07:16:01 You whore! Stop beating your pasta like that.

But seriously, stop. Do NOT add oil to the pasta when cooking it. Add a pinch of salt, nothing else. Oil just sticks to the spaghetti and makes the sauce slide off. If you want to do an olive oil dressing, prepare that separately.
7864 2018-08-02 07:15:49 อยากทราบตอนนี้ราคา มินิแคนดี้บง ราคาอยู่ที่เท่าไหร่บ้างหรอคะ #วันซ์สายเปย์

7866 2018-08-02 07:15:34 I think you’re missing the point Karen, lambert didn’t say about the track being bad. He is staying that in the pits you have rules and regulations regarding oil spillage for environmental regulations. He is saying that they need to spend money to avoid these things happening...
7867 2018-08-02 07:15:11 มีมินิแคนดี้บงบ้างมั๊ยคะ //สอบถามราคาก่อนน๊า

7878 2018-08-02 07:13:09 this way of thinking is why 22 vets kill themselves a day in this country. yea imperialism is to keep us safe here because ppl that don't even have planes want to kill u, not so big oil, the military industrial complex can keep getting rich off blood money
7879 2018-08-02 07:11:52 even if you don’t pray, pray for me. I got some oil on my sweater from some fried fish I had for dinner. it’s currently in the wash & I don’t want it to stain  send love

I never thought for one minute that my experience of oil &gas collaboration would be unique in this world.
7884 2018-08-02 07:10:44 Wish people would actually read what Neil’s and Robert have said. Both clearly stated that the track conditions were poor and pouring oil is clearly a environmental issue. They both don’t blame either for losing the meeting.
7885 2018-08-02 07:10:42 I hv heard that
While we purchase oil,we give some amount of money named as "fund fr Bangladeish"

7911 2018-08-02 07:04:22 I can't claim credit for that - I stole it from our senior technician for the teaching labs. Swapping to glycerine means that the inevitable cleaning up after students is a doddle.  My own lab oilbaths are still working through our stocks of Lidl's basic olive oil.
7912 2018-08-02 07:04:00 Did you know coating stainless steel vessels with olive oil halts bacterial infestation? The oil fills in the cracks, creates a hydrophobic layer and acts as a barrier to contamination on the surface. Use it as an alternative to harsh detergents and liquids.

7919 2018-08-02 07:02:34 Maybe it's the subsidies? 

"Still, in Norway, oil wealth may have made the state reluctant to make reforms or cut subsidies unthinkable elsewhere. Farm subsidies allow farmers, for instance, to keep dairy cows in heated barns in the Arctic"

7976 2018-08-02 06:49:54 The reason people are saying mayo is weird is because mayo is made out of eggs and oil bro, dairy/sweet and salty goes great with potatoes too. Think butter or sour cream on a baked potato + more crunch and sweetness

8126 2018-08-02 06:18:35 I don't think we've ever had pure capitalism. Or America has never had (government subsidies and private-public endeavors in all kinds of ways). So I think a lot of the talk of anti-capitalism and fears of socialism are overstated. 

We have oil subsidies as we speak.

8133 2018-08-02 06:17:21 Of course. I like to share when doing an anointing too about the Bishop blessing the oil right before easter, and how that means we’ve been praying over the sick to be anointed with that oil ever since that moment, even if not exactly by name. Now that’s advanced preparation!
8134 2018-08-02 06:17:19 I flipped a bitch right now because of all the oil/grease from my pasta pooling on the side of my plate, yet I ain’t saying shit when I throw a dozen donut holes down my gullet

8180 2018-08-02 06:08:05 Olive oil is beneficial, but how much should you be eating to live longer? Just one table spoon of olive oil a day is enough to prevent fatal diseases like cancers and strokes. Make sure you don’t have more than that because it also has calories, although not the harmful ones.

8190 2018-08-02 06:05:59 Dont back your currency with oil or any other commodity. Commodities are for consumption. Producers can erode the value at any time by producing more than the market can consume. Is there no sanity left in the world?

8193 2018-08-02 06:05:45 Right, you'd need a good dense caramel or beer batter. And like frying cheese or butter, I'd probably freeze it before into the oil.
But with proper precaution...

8219 2018-08-02 06:01:10 “Why you still work out after you’ve reached your goal?” 

Why do you continue to get oil changes after you get it changed the first time? To keep that MF up and running and in good condition, right?

8257 2018-08-02 05:54:15 It would be beneficial if the government can arrange a direct line of oil & gas supply at a special low price from Iran to mitigate inflation brought about by increasing world prices.  Just thinking out loud.
8258 2018-08-02 05:54:10 I put coconut oil on my eyelashes and it got in my eyes and I was semi blind for 2 minutes, hows your night going?
8259 2018-08-02 05:54:01 Yet you dismiss all alternatives that involve changing how we live to reduce fossil fuel consumption so we don’t need more tankers, expanded pipelines or oil-by-rail…

We need societal change (especially respect for Indigenous rights & consent), not more fossil fuel expansion.
8260 2018-08-02 05:53:47 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
8261 2018-08-02 05:53:12 No at the rates humans are consuming it. Peak oil is a real concern. Shale oil technology has pushed the estimated date into the future.
8262 2018-08-02 05:53:02 I'm actually not that big a fan of Murder Burger.  They've had the same oil in their fryer since Moses wore short pants.  Their milk shakes are better, though.  See, now I want to go eat there tomorrow and report back.  Haven't been in years.
8263 2018-08-02 05:52:53 I’ve tweeted this before buuuut if you are struggling with acne and can’t find a solution I HIGHLY suggest putting lavender oil on your trouble areas. It’s truly a blessing.
8264 2018-08-02 05:52:40 Matthew asked me for my keys so he could see what bulb I needes for my headlight while I was at work but instead he took it to get a new bulb, got my tires and oil checked, filled my windshield fluid and put gas in my car. I'm sorry but I wanted to fucking cry. 
8265 2018-08-02 05:52:24 I need to just stick with oil cleansing. I have these three big ass pimples on my face, slathered my face with some olive castor and tea tree oil and they’re already getting smaller.

8268 2018-08-02 05:52:15 Screwing with the Iran deal is causing oil prices to go up which is draining disposable income, causing inflation and more than offsetting tax cuts. We now have declining real wages. Screwing with Obamacare has caused spikes in insurance premiums due to lack of individual mandate
8269 2018-08-02 05:51:55 Of course and I know they were using palm oil. Probably still do but I don't know.

8280 2018-08-02 05:49:28 I use orange oil when I clean - I adore that it cuts the grease and smells amazing when I'm done.  Also works to remove sticky label glue.

8297 2018-08-02 05:46:13 We have no access to contractual documents for exploration. But that is a normal case. The state sell exploration rights to certain companies. Thus before they exploit any drop of oil millions of dollars are already paid.

8336 2018-08-02 05:38:47 Dinosaurs are not a source of petroleum. 

Fossil fuel is a derivative of marine life that settled to the bottom of oceans and buried under hundreds or thousands of feet of sediments. Time, faulting folding and pressure has made oil pool into reservoirs.

8340 2018-08-02 05:38:18 Oil revenue is very dependent on the world market price. In 2017 it was still low at around 45$/barrel. Compare the BIP from 2003 up to 2016. You will see how much the BIP rise in years like 2008. On long term oil is contri much more as on a short time frame like 1 year.

8351 2018-08-02 05:36:19 Oil prices rose on Thursday, steadying after losses over the past two days from a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories and renewed concerns over trade friction between the U.S. and China.

8391 2018-08-02 05:27:59 Sir go and do research on the price of oil since 1999 it has never been stable ,it has been going up and down .the point there is the man at the helm of affair is clueless and rigid ,he is not sound and flexible to the dynamics on ground
8392 2018-08-02 05:27:55 Diy deodorant with bentonite clay, essential oils, and tea tree oil - super easy to make, magic mud toothpaste (bentonite clay - which is pretty much volcanic ash, and coconut charcoal ) , Castille soap (infinite uses)
8393 2018-08-02 05:27:06 Taking the economy down is easier than most are saying.  We have the weapons to decimate oil production country wide.  That's really their only weapon besides jihad suicide.  Israel, Saudi & Jordan will lend a hand if needed!  Poor Iranian people may have to exodus!  Refugees??

8409 2018-08-02 05:23:38 Please, please. I can't wait to see Howard, Downer and a conga line of others brought to account over the "wheat for oil" scandal and Reithexposed for his  involvement in the Patricks waterfront dispute..
8410 2018-08-02 05:23:35 Aww poor you. I get it a lot and it’s horrible. Lavender oil is good as it reading - until the book is good and then you don’t want to sleep.

8412 2018-08-02 05:23:21 Is it because of a shift in commodity trades demand to crude oil and copper? I tend to think so.

8414 2018-08-02 05:22:51 EXACTLY! He is. Total snake oil salesman. People in NY knew it for years. The fact that people thought a orange reality TV star/billionaire was going to look out for them astonished me. The GOP/Trump tax cut for the rich and the purposed new one now and STILL they believe??? Wow

Its also fair to mention that Turkey laundered oil stolen by ISIS in Syria & got upset when US/Israel/Saudi started courting the Kurds
8418 2018-08-02 05:21:51 Scree scraw scree scraw. Hoping these old-world charming train sounds will continue all the way to Brisbane. Heaven forbid someone oil something.

8424 2018-08-02 05:20:38 Why its ok; *remove the stigma* - I've dated girls that have felt effected by lack of natural lubrication not lack of sex drive; and I find men see that also as they are failing there partner or a lack of communication- Lube is good; like oil in cooking

8426 2018-08-02 05:19:42 A "charity" founded by a shale oil developer, a previous owner of James Hardie and a former public servant and lobbyist who ended up the CEO of a Japanese property development firm.

8432 2018-08-02 05:19:02 i understand why oil companies lie about climate change but i don't understand why pastors lie about evolution like what's even the benefit
8433 2018-08-02 05:18:59 Within his cult of faux socilaists (who mostly can't define what that is), he most definitely is the prophet.  He acts like it, too, demanding total fealty to his vapid and shopworn ideas.  Dems have his number as a snake oil salesman who steals Dem bills and ideas, does nothing.

8438 2018-08-02 05:18:08 Many believe rich oil companies should defend THEIR OWN property/interests in the Middle East, thus relieving our busybody government of it's excuse to indulge in military adventures there. Few know that private army/diplomacy idea is rooted in #anarchoCapitalism.

8468 2018-08-02 05:13:46 Obama was president during the largest oil production increase in US history. To use the term 100% to refer to his effort on doing anything substantial on climate change is a serious stretch.

8477 2018-08-02 05:12:06 That is true that she cannot restore monarchy to Iran. Pahlavi was to replace Ghajar to set up for an oil exporting nation which had not spent all those centuries fighting Russian kings or Ottomans. But to think a new regime that governs its export policies is also naive thought.

8493 2018-08-02 05:08:53 I'm not demonizing smoking weed, its making a discernment from being on both sides. Knowing what both are capable of and a lot of the time, it's not a necessary component. I even referred to micro dosing as to not get high or using CBD oil instead.
8494 2018-08-02 05:08:47 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.

8503 2018-08-02 05:06:46 North Korean tankers siphoning clandestine cargoes of oil in international waters from ships that often switch off their satellite tracking system to prevent any monitoring of their activities
8504 2018-08-02 05:06:24 And what you call just ‘PILGRIMAGE’ is a pillar of our faith. It is more important than the trade or any other reason the two nations have in common(oil or tea exports to Saudi Arabia)

8511 2018-08-02 05:05:27 Russia and China are blocking a U.S. effort at the United Nations to halt all deliveries of refined oil products to North Korea amid charges that Pyongyang is smuggling fuel into the country
8512 2018-08-02 05:05:24 They are very foolish ,they need nobody to tell them,they'd taken sides,hence shouldn't be taken serious.
8513 2018-08-02 05:05:05 Actual good life tip: keep a little spray bottle of lavender oil/water/witch hazel by your bed and spray it around you once you lay down to go to sleep. So pleasing to the senses
8514 2018-08-02 05:04:56 Btw, the oil in wind turbines needs cleaning up as well.
8515 2018-08-02 05:04:48 Not sure I deserved that. My comment about tankers is a pragmatic acknowledgement that the Pacific Northwest will be receiving oil by tanker. NEB regulated tankers are safer than non-NEB regulated tankers.
8516 2018-08-02 05:04:32 Who’s the Deep State Sibel? Any tensions right now between Turkey and Israel? How much oil stolen from Syria by ISIS was Turkey laundering? What was Israel’s involvement in 9/11?

8526 2018-08-02 05:01:43 Don't do that, it will taste terrible and burnt. Use oil (coconut/olive), 1 cup of oil for 1 cup of trees. Cook for 3-4 hours on low heat with occasional stirring. Use a strainer to remove leaves from oil. You can use that oil for anything afterwards, baking, eggs, meat...

8652 2018-08-02 04:39:26 We are on oil heating too. We have solar but not enough to cover our oil use! I bought wind shares to offset our oil & petrol but that doesn't count on the survey.
8653 2018-08-02 04:39:23 this coconut oil mask feels like clouds on my face 
8654 2018-08-02 04:38:16 Idk if it counts as techno but Sophie’s new album “oil of every pearl’s un-insides” is really enjoyable. It’s a weird back and forth of surgery synth pop and metallic industrial distorted techno type stuff. Both styles very uniquely produced. Almost noise at points
8655 2018-08-02 04:38:11 So happy for you. I remember when Bobby traveled for Mobil Oil. Very hard time. He is going to make a better life for you two

Plan idea 2: grow LNG
Plan idea 3: build an east-west energy corridor to ship oil, gas & electricity
Plan idea 4: make solar panels mandatory on new houses, 50% roof coverage minimum
Plan idea 5: make Canada an energy export powerhouse
8660 2018-08-02 04:37:54 Actually I really don’t want oil to live long!   to big oil a step closer to death, liveable planet etc :)
8661 2018-08-02 04:37:45 I’m acne-prone, but since my acne is largely due to diet & inflammatory stuff, this stuff just keeps me from breaking out *worse* and doesn’t get rid of it. However, it definitely works for keeping my skin hydrated and preventing excess oil production!
8662 2018-08-02 04:37:44 The first ingredient of cetaphil is mineral oil so it’s basically like washing your face with lotion, technically it’s not doing anything “bad” but it’s just moving stuff around on your skin instead of cleansing and st Ives is way too harsh!
8663 2018-08-02 04:37:37 HELLO use a mandolin to get super thin, consistent slices. To kick up the quality of your chips you can freeze them before you fry
(TL;DR - science: the ice crystals explode in the hot oil and tear up the inside of the potato which makes the chips lighter and crunchier )

8668 2018-08-02 04:36:57 The low oil price over Q3 should help most of them restructure their hedges. Buy back sold calls. A Saudi gift for them by increasing production pre-emptively :)
8669 2018-08-02 04:36:56 You are calling upon the wrong people....we have no oil to offer them so they won’t even flinch.
8670 2018-08-02 04:36:33 Olive oil. Almond oil. Avocado oil. Tea tree oil. Jamaican black castor oil. And jojoba oil. I add a drop or two of peppermint or lavender oil for smell good.
8671 2018-08-02 04:36:25 And that's not even counting how much you can make in oil fields. It's hard, dirty work but some places were paying close to $50K as a starting wage for newbies because they needed workers so bad.
8672 2018-08-02 04:35:28 That figures. Just like the coal and oil industry people he has guiding the EPA.
8673 2018-08-02 04:35:21 You leave it in the oil a little too long
8674 2018-08-02 04:35:00 You can also try 2-4g of ginger regularly (up to 3x a day), castor oil heat packs (use cling wrap to avoid getting it everywhere), and valerian at night (don't mix with alcohol). Hope you feel better asap!

8679 2018-08-02 04:33:25 Much like, cheese, pizza, meat, oil and processed food are now subject to the tax if they contain more than 2.3% saturated fat.
8680 2018-08-02 04:33:18 i need a hot oil treatment . my scalp feels like its mad at me 
8681 2018-08-02 04:33:11 Nope. Not quiting now. I’ve been on a big high and made it through some pretty low times, too. And can’t wait for the high to swing our way again. We’re in this together, Oil!
8682 2018-08-02 04:33:10 Something about vitamin e oil really helps my skin
8683 2018-08-02 04:32:55 Annnnnnnnd after all that waiting, I didn't have enough white soap to pipe and cover all the soap. Fuck it, just gonna leave as is and not put any embeds, etc on top of it. Going to have to order more fragrance oil for the redo.
8684 2018-08-02 04:32:49 Is Balco any relation to the flaxseed oil producers?
8685 2018-08-02 04:32:45 Thanks! I have “ear oil” that does the same thing. It’s better for me than ear plugs because it’s more comfortable. But in winter I need the ear plugs because the cold feels like a knife in my brain.

8690 2018-08-02 04:31:46 Based on the sectors who got the most favorable new thresholds they are mostly concerned about jobs in Ontario and Quebec. The oil patch suffered far more and will have to play by a different set of rules than the favored sectors.
8691 2018-08-02 04:31:44 We'll wreck the oceans and the atmosphere centuries before we run out of oil. One of the features of capitalism: as you drive the price up, known reserves *increase* because things like tar sands become viable. Current oil fields are "empty" when 50% of the oil has been extracted
8692 2018-08-02 04:31:32 Shower.... coconut oil rub down.... silk sheets..... and slow jamz. Good night 
8693 2018-08-02 04:31:25 Mikes Mighty Good Craft Ramen Spicy Beef. I thought it was gonna be some BS hipster ramen trash but it lowkey was slap. And it comes with some oil in the pack so it make the broth real flavorful.

In the next 2 days Iran will practice a military blockade of the most important oil shipping route in Mid East.

Trump will be golfing.

8708 2018-08-02 04:28:58 I looked up some recipes but those will take a long time. I bet you could roast some garlic in oil/butter then whip that into some vanilla ice cream. Most of the recipes had vanilla in them with the garlic
8709 2018-08-02 04:28:57 I do a hot oil rinse on my scalp often. But I blend a few different oils and then rinse it out. But I'll apply it regularly just because with a bottle that has the little nozzle on it.
8710 2018-08-02 04:28:33 "I...erm...saw "Mechanic changes juicy oil." Quite a lot. Trust me, I was there for the same kind of work."

8712 2018-08-02 04:28:32 Trump has been discussing why high gas mileage on vehicles is bad. Promotes coal and oil use. Atheists for trump? How can you have so much cognitive dissonance when it's all right in front of you.
8713 2018-08-02 04:28:23 A young and attractive patient had the job of “entertainer” but got her health insurance through a big oil company. So apparently, she’s on big oil’s payroll with that job title.

8717 2018-08-02 04:26:54 Silliest take: WH claiming trump was just "expressing opinion" when tweeting RE stopping Russia probe.

I work for an oil major, researching methane conversion to chemicals. If my CEO tweeted "we should stop methane to chem R&D" I would take that VERY SERIOUSLY and stop my work
8718 2018-08-02 04:26:47 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

Nah she tryna get me 2 come spend a night.
Tempting... but i'd rather lay in bed alone & watch a movie dis time.

8722 2018-08-02 04:25:09 The dose makes the poison, e.g. I don't worry about toasted sesame oil because a little goes such a long way.
8723 2018-08-02 04:24:54 We absolutely will! The lying Snake Oil Salesman in Chief deserves it.
8724 2018-08-02 04:24:41 I dropped my whole jar of coconut oil on my foot in the shower today. It shattered as it hit so now I have a literal hole on it that won’t stop bleeding.
8725 2018-08-02 04:24:23 This notes for myself.  I already know that exfoliate only 2-3 times per week.  Oil cleanser using at night only. AHA/BHA and acid toner is the same thing.  I did stated DAY & NIGHT? this is NOTA bukan BUKU TEKS.  I ll not listdown everything. Tulis yg kemungkinan lupa dh la.

The question is whether you think the overall harms of nuclear power plants are worse than the overall harms of, say, coal mines and oil rigs and fracking operations, which you can say the same thing about

8731 2018-08-02 04:23:40 I drive an electric car. I haven’t bought gas or oil for a year. I plug it in like a phone, it charges, and Exxon feels like a century ago. I’m not saying this to rub it in. I’m saying everyone go rent an electric car for a day. It’s like going from a rotary phone to an iPhone.

8739 2018-08-02 04:23:00 Most Oil growth by 2040 is seen in tight oil and natural gas liquids, which reach nearly 30 percent of global liquids supply. 

• Continued investment is needed to mitigate decline and meet growing demand
• North America swings to a net exporter as shale growth continues
8740 2018-08-02 04:22:43 It me.

Lavender/Black seed oil blend for any reason at all, but tea tree/eucalyptus/rose hip blend for defense from these vampire mosquitoes.

8744 2018-08-02 04:21:36 I'd even agree than measures taken to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere aren't really useful and that efforts should've (and were) put in subsidizing alternative forms of power generation rather than crippling the coal (on its way out anyway) and oil industry.
8745 2018-08-02 04:21:24 So it is probably a lot more than that then. Add on the value of water they get from us and the tax revenue from our products which are exported abroad via ports and airports down south and we are getting past the illogical deficit they say Scotland has. Not to mention oil/gas.
8746 2018-08-02 04:21:12 Covered in spider bites after first night sleeping in my new house. I doused my entire mattress and body in tea tree oil (as per @AlisonRainWood suggestion) to prepare for tonight's battle w/spider  PLSPROTECTME

8758 2018-08-02 04:18:30 It's not even being nice per se. It's that harridan nagging can't leave it alone or take what you say at face value everything is an argument to win non stop fight of a contentious woman which I can't stand. Like grasping oil in the hand to contain her.

8762 2018-08-02 04:17:15 I dont need to be told that putting a oil lobbyist in charge of the EPA he advocated destroying is a bad idea

For example Trump's USFW recently announced they are reducing the protected range of America's critically endangered red wolves by 90%. They can be shot if they leave.

Pushing his oiled up hands down onto her back Barry Kahn began to gyrate his hands in a clockwise motion, spreading the oil across her entire upper and lower back.

8767 2018-08-02 04:16:18 So what do I do with the raven oil ?  If you don’t think I wanna know, just ignore
8768 2018-08-02 04:16:09 one time I got tea tree oil in my eye and I rly thought I was going blind.
8769 2018-08-02 04:16:08 That’s nasty. Why lather yourself? I was genuinely just trying to breathe I never use them on my body only oil i use on my skin is vitamin e bc she good for me
8770 2018-08-02 04:15:56 i say relatively well but now that i think of it i had bread dipped in olive oil as a meal so.
8771 2018-08-02 04:15:53 Yeah I’ll either do that or make sure I give the oil plenty of time to absorb. But I probably still won’t risk it
8772 2018-08-02 04:15:50 @RepDMB Diane Mitsch Bush is clearly the better candidate for Colorado District 3 Representative. Incumbent @RepTipton received $39,000 to write a proposal mostly written by the oil and gas lobbyist for a Texas-based energy company & he voted 56 times against the health care bill
8773 2018-08-02 04:15:38 So you guys still think oil provides moisture to your hair??? Yeah no. Only water and water based products can do that. So glad I’ve removed myself from natural hair blogs. They are stripping women of their common sense. IG and all of their natural hair stylists can have a seat

Conflict w/ Iran to raise oil prices. Russia is a petro-state and they’re broke.
Attack NATO allies and weaken alliance. 
Stop joint military exercises w/ S. Korea. 
Weaken US trade;create a vacuum w/ established partners for RU to step in. 
8782 2018-08-02 04:14:27 Walking is a good addiction, I promise you. Most daily needs/visits to market don't need a vehicle. To reach, in most of the city, usr feeder roads to walk. As vehicles decrease, pollution will come down. We import oil and it pollutes. Walk & put pressure for better pavements

8785 2018-08-02 04:14:01 WOW! It's like a seesaw! When sanctions r on & there's no Russia or Chinese investigation-Kochs win!They can run their oil gas convert fossil fuels into many products BUT with tariffs on-Putin wins He runs oil &gas & steel Russian oligarchs win too! How does Turkey fit in?
8786 2018-08-02 04:13:58 Well, thanks. There’s a little problem with approximately 63 million of my fellow Americans who will swallow any old snake oil they are sold, though. And from the real world’s most obvious super-villain posing as a good guy.

8789 2018-08-02 04:13:26 The soon we run out the better. Then maybe we can move forward. Oil is going to run out. We better face that fact.
8790 2018-08-02 04:13:20 In all spat about tariffs..EM's especially India can be immune? Oil off from highs..
8791 2018-08-02 04:13:20 Also MCT oil is the truth. Just had some tea with some butter creamer - what a delicious flavor.
8792 2018-08-02 04:13:03 I probably just coated my hair with like 1/4 of my coconut oil, I’m covered in it lol
8793 2018-08-02 04:13:00 The use of charcoal outside of the emergency room and in inappropriate doses is misleading. It is gritting or snake oil depending on how it is sold. Curious you are having trouble with that being factual.

8808 2018-08-02 04:10:15 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.

Minimal oil is normal bcs kulit yang sihat dia still akan produce adequate sebum, baru moisture-sebum kulit tu balance. Kalau tak extremely oily, probably normal :)
8818 2018-08-02 04:09:51 Olive oil? Fam you cooking?
8819 2018-08-02 04:09:45 Nah, you've mixed up cause and effect. The low prices forced producers to slash costs, which created the demand for productivity-raising technology. Lots of examples, inc. drilling rigs, oil sands trucks etc. PetroLMI says 52k direct O&G jobs lost, only 17k coming back by 2021.
8820 2018-08-02 04:09:44 You’re welcome. I have mom’s arthritis in the left hip. And this brand of fish oil was recommended to me. Worked wonders. Get it from amazon!! Let me know how it goes?

8832 2018-08-02 04:08:24 Potatoes/ Sweet Potato’s/ Yam’s are ALL good. 
If it comes from the earth, it’s GOOD. 

The problem is: 

1. WHO consumes it. 
( are you Carb intolerant? )

2. HOW they consume it.  
(Is it fried in oil ? ) 

3. WHEN they consume it. 
(are you eating with no exercise? )

8842 2018-08-02 04:07:07 Remember not to pick on it when scab starts forming. Just put on the oil to soften it and let it fall off on its own.
I burned myself once while taking a hot tray of cookies out of the oven. Applied oil immediately. Diligently applied it daily. There is hardly any scarring 
8843 2018-08-02 04:07:05 Several of my grandkids have had it and we got rid of it by mixing lavender essential oil and fractionated coconut oil together in a roller bottle and had them roll it on whenever it bothers them.  It cleared up pretty quick.

It's one of the big surprises of history that that didn't happen

8925 2018-08-02 03:55:27 - use vaseline, black caster oil, coconut oil, and a q-tip.
- get one of those 3 (i use vaseline) and apply it on your eyebrows and eyelashes with a q-tip.
- this will make them thicker and longer overtime. maybe a couple weeks.
8926 2018-08-02 03:55:20 Kinda already do this. Some chicken wings on occasion but usually beef, avocado and supplements fish oil, k2, boron, D3 (10k), choline, collagen(just added this week)

8934 2018-08-02 03:54:16 Coconut oil after a hot shower >
8935 2018-08-02 03:54:11 いい感じで進んでるよね！この調子で！
8936 2018-08-02 03:53:52 I use coconut oil for everything... make up removal, moisturizing my body, hair styling.
8937 2018-08-02 03:53:45 Sudah bakar essential oil aromatherapy pake lilin, minum teh hijau, dengar musik instrumental, inhale-exhale, makan coklat sampe gigi ngilu...tetep weehhh rungsing pengen ngamuk dan anxious bin insecure bin panik HADEEEUUHH

this is what's u get as a procrastinator sejati
8938 2018-08-02 03:53:38 considering the marriage slump that’s on this oil age and pulexes three shillings a pint and wives at six and seven when domestic calamitie
s belame par and newlaids bellow mar for the twenty twotoosent time thwealthy took thousands in the slack march of civilisation were you,
8939 2018-08-02 03:53:35 there are hundreds of thousands of wells drilled in the oil sands. do some research before running your mouth next time so that you don’t look a fucktard
8940 2018-08-02 03:53:30 Those not willing to let the anointing build their house will lose everything they’ve done in the flesh, but they themselves, their spirits and souls will be saved through fire. It is written. Trust the oil!
8941 2018-08-02 03:53:26 idk what lush were thinking by launching skin coloured oil as foundation
8942 2018-08-02 03:53:24 Urgh that is even worse that oil splatter.
8943 2018-08-02 03:53:16 The oil stock is simply the container for the Oil of the Sick, which we bring with us to celebrate Anointing of the Sick. Most often we’ll hold in it oil blessed by the Bishop at the Chrism Mass, but sometimes will have non-blessed oil, which we can bless during the rite itself.
8944 2018-08-02 03:53:15 Losing rigs yet producing more oil and gas than ever.   This is an efficiency"problem".  It takes 1/10th as long to drill the same hole as it did in 2002.  That job will never recover under any government.
8945 2018-08-02 03:52:33 GD the BLM for catering to rich oil barons and ranchers who are very self serving and would kill their own kids to get rich .
Our wild horses caught in the middle sufferthe ultimate sacrifice ..their freedom . Next will b us as our food & water & land  are threatened by fracking
8946 2018-08-02 03:52:30 I just dropped a brand new jar of coconut oil in the shower...that’s $15 down the drain. Literally.

8954 2018-08-02 03:51:52 2/2 their service to make up for it. Nobody really makes money off the gas. Taxes eats that up. The money was made by selling oil changes mechanic work, and now everything the convenance store provides. The gas just got them in the door. Tariffs are much the same. Thru the door.
8955 2018-08-02 03:51:41 I think the bigger the eyebrow the better as long as it isn’t a unibrow or you don’t look like you have caterpillars on your island. If you want to grow them back you can use castor oil.
8956 2018-08-02 03:51:34 Washington is trying to overthrow governments in Venezuela and Nicaragua & has bought off the Ecuadorian government with oil purchases & the usual personal bribes. EvoMorales govt in Bolivia is targeted by the CIA. Obama removed the reform govts in Honduras, Argentina & Brazil.

Wait, I mean wood splinters and sharp metal manly things...? 
8961 2018-08-02 03:50:52 fuck mom where's the olive oil?
8962 2018-08-02 03:50:21 Lol during the oil price crash but dont let that ruin your story
8963 2018-08-02 03:50:15 I just got a pedicure 4 days ago but I want another so they can put hot oil and massage my feet 
8964 2018-08-02 03:50:13 ใจลึกๆก็อยากให้วงตัวเองมานะ แต่ก็แบบโอ๊ยจนมาก จนเหลือเกินช่วงนี้ ฮือออ
8965 2018-08-02 03:50:13 coconut oil, then wipe it off xoxo
8966 2018-08-02 03:49:39 Bobo ka talaga... Ang China ang gagastos sa oil exploration tapos wala silang parte... Joint Venture nga eh diba. BUGGOOKKK!!!
8967 2018-08-02 03:49:21 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
8968 2018-08-02 03:49:18 頑張る〜(*´-`)
長期休暇って何故かお昼に起きちゃうんだよねw
今日も時間ギリギリだった
8969 2018-08-02 03:48:57 夏は水道水を冷やしては飲んでを繰り返してるので、3リットルとかはかなり危ないラインな気がしてきました…
8970 2018-08-02 03:48:52 My friend: yeah the fries are made with sunflower oil
Me: oh cool, they’re vegan
My friend: You’re vegan?!!
Me: *eating McDonald’s chicken nuggets*
My friend: ???
8971 2018-08-02 03:48:15 Optimus rubbing baby oil on Megatron and sniffing her and getting hard.
8972 2018-08-02 03:48:00 2. Schools. We spend all our time there! Naomi says that children need to learn and everyone should be able to afford to go to school. Jonah says we need to make sure that the playgrounds are safe. Schools shouldn't be near oil wells or polluting sites.
8973 2018-08-02 03:47:51 Something seems off on the #Oilers Darnell Nurse front? Agent & team are saying it’s a bridge deal but yet we sit here on August 1st & he’s not signed yet. Are the Oil trying to get him signed under $3M? Player is asking for $3.3M. If it’s a bridge deal why isn’t he signed yet???
8974 2018-08-02 03:47:49 Big oil, car manufacturers ( both entry and luxury), and shortsellers must all be pooin their pants. Shortsellers will need new pants for all the poopoo :)
8975 2018-08-02 03:47:48 I personally don’t remember any of the trade wars. I can only reference the gas wars of the 70’s. A lucky few consumers benefited from that, but only occasionally. That said, the oil companies didn’t care. They charged the same. The retailers were hurt somewhat but improved 1/2
8976 2018-08-02 03:47:41 Cannabis oil?
8977 2018-08-02 03:47:34 I'm not one to judge hobbies, but why do you buy painful oil?
8978 2018-08-02 03:47:32 also my kitchen manager does not feel heat. He grabbed a fryer grate that sitting in 400 degrees oil for 12 hours a day barehanded like man is straight a government creation
8979 2018-08-02 03:47:24 I enthusiastically join you but if you have followed Zinke's tweets, other than oil-gas-coal, he main love is trophies of dead animals and their shooters. Safari Club types dominate his "advisory" committee. He is the worst.
8980 2018-08-02 03:47:08 OH YES HE DID !! He then back peddles and lies! "Shady Hock was a hoax", and many more inflammatory lies to sell his snake oil. #Idiocracy
8981 2018-08-02 03:47:01 I thought I'd try spraying my fries with a little bit of pan spray and see if it made a difference, but I don't really want to add oil and I'm happy with the crunch w/o it ;) I'm kinda surprised I like it, I was skeptical going in.....
8982 2018-08-02 03:47:00 Hate  be BLM with a passion . They also want to sell leasing permits to Canada so they can frack for oil in our Petrified Forest.
 We can't pick up one rock but the Canadians can go in and drill wells for fracking in the Petrified Forest ?! The world is upside down !
8983 2018-08-02 03:46:57 1 rt and i’ll pour iced coffee in my oil diffuser and see what happens
8984 2018-08-02 03:46:54 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with sushi.
8985 2018-08-02 03:46:50 also does anyone know if putting castor oil on your eyelashes actually helps them grow bc my friend does it but she bought like 30$ castor oil for it n already kinda had long lashes so
8986 2018-08-02 03:46:44 Oil change?
8987 2018-08-02 03:46:30 防弾少年団と出会ってから、心が少しは綺麗になったのか、アスファルトの上で干からびて白くなってるミミズ見て「この子達は土に還って大地となり私たちの血となり肉となる…輪廻転生だ…」とか思うくらい平成最後の夏が暑くてヤラレてる(少年団関係ないやーん)
8988 2018-08-02 03:46:12 アチー
8989 2018-08-02 03:46:06 Hey @subaru_usa - My 2013 Outback has used oil since I bought it after my other vehicle drowned in Sandy.  Now I have been told that I need to pay $2700 to remove the engine due to an oil leak. Garage kept car - proof no oil stain. WTF? This is a documented problem.
8990 2018-08-02 03:46:05 OKAY me and peppermint oil are FIGHTING 

In unrelated news, never ever get peppermint oil in your eye
8991 2018-08-02 03:46:01 It doesn't matter where you get your oil from, or even if you get it from within the US. If you shut down the Straits, global supply takes a huge hit, prices take a huge rise. Do you think Exxon is going to give us a special friends and family price?
8992 2018-08-02 03:45:58 You even re tweeted it. For being concerned about endangered species. According the WHO 3.4 million people die each year from water related diseases. What happens when oil & waste r dumped  & HUMANS exhaust all water resources; What happens when we can't drink water?  We die.
8993 2018-08-02 03:45:54 i lose a lot of hair but i brush it rrly quick when it's wet (shampoo+conditioner) and dry it a little then brush again and put the oil on
8994 2018-08-02 03:45:49 @mverbora 
My 29 yr old son with autism. Since he was 21 has violent episodes of yelling, swearing, hitting, worse now trying to hurt himself and me.  
I tried the pills that under the tongue but takes a long time. 
Please let me know if the CBD oil will help my son please
8995 2018-08-02 03:45:47 And also I step outside and smell oil cause my clothes are fucking drenched cause I’m not on days off
8996 2018-08-02 03:45:43 Hope somebody snuck in some oil.
8997 2018-08-02 03:45:43 I read that putting castor oil on ur eyebrows helps them grow 

I just hope it works & I don’t break out 
8998 2018-08-02 03:45:24 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8999 2018-08-02 03:45:22 Yall, putting castor oil on your eyelashes every night reeeally helps them grow fast and healthy.
9000 2018-08-02 03:45:20 Literally every burger I have ever had from A&W has been greasy as hell. Check the burger bag for oil.
9001 2018-08-02 03:45:18 You think paying for 5 million people all of the same ethnicity is the same as 400 million with the diversity of America?   And it is absolutely relevant that their oil supply funds their social programs.  Also that they don't have to pay for a defense budget. Another idiot.
9002 2018-08-02 03:45:04 They are pretty good. Like they have different types of pedicures and I chose gel and some olive oil moisturizing thing that’s why I paid that much. They have cheaper ones and more expensive packets
9003 2018-08-02 03:45:03 A very old and traditional 3d printer, suggest add some lubricating oil to the rod and screw if the 3d printer stay long time no use.
9004 2018-08-02 03:44:50 I'm trying mad hard not to give in and cut my hair (mostly bc ive spent money on biotin and castor oil) but it's weird bc I haven't had long hair since I was in hs
9005 2018-08-02 03:44:31 My life when I need to buy more oil pain and canvases
9006 2018-08-02 03:44:27 It don’t matter how rich I get there are certain things Ill never do like set up automatic payments for bills, pay shit n advance (I just wanna pay my past due), replace all 4 tires (just let me get 2 today), buy the extra shit they try to sell u at the oil change spots
9007 2018-08-02 03:44:22 ทำให้เขาเกลีนด เพื่อให้เขาออกจากชีวิต มันจำเป็น แม้จะยังรักก็ตาม.
9008 2018-08-02 03:44:21 今ヒルナンデスって水卜アナじゃないんだね……でも新しいアナウンサーの方、すごいタイプだ。セラピストさんにあんな感じの方がいたら通っちゃいますね
9009 2018-08-02 03:44:03 Not yet. Oil is going out. In 100 years from now most of us on the planet will be driving electric cars. I don’t care if you like gas cars. You’ll just have to convert your hot rods then.
9010 2018-08-02 03:44:02 Hope his family finds answers.
9011 2018-08-02 03:44:02 Lavender essential oil or gtfo
9012 2018-08-02 03:43:59 today garrett brought my car to get the oil changed, washed and vacuumed! he’s the sweetest
9013 2018-08-02 03:43:54 There is no "witch Hunt", you Broke The Law, and Muller wants to get to the bottom of it!  You're nothing but a fake phoney, snake oil selling two bit con man!
9014 2018-08-02 03:43:34 I need to order some more tamanu oil. It definitely keeps my face and kids moisturized overnight.
9015 2018-08-02 03:43:16 (5/5) .. Quote ‘If the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water – unless we change our approach to manage this precious and vital resource’. By: Ismail Serageldin, former Vice-President of the World Bank, August 1995
9016 2018-08-02 03:43:06 น้องแบม แล้วพี่มาร์คจะให้พี่ยืมป่าวอ่ะ
9017 2018-08-02 03:43:05 Is any sick among you?let him call for the elders of the church;and let them pray over him,anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:And the prayer of faith shall save the sick,and the Lord shall raise him up;and if he hath committed sins,they shall be forgiven himJam5:14-15
9018 2018-08-02 03:43:00 Take a warm bath with a few drops of #Vetiver essential oil for deep relaxation.
9019 2018-08-02 03:42:56 I grabbed one too, not the dash but power fryer xl and I’ve been air frying a bunch of stuff. However I do add small bits of oil for some extra crunch 
9020 2018-08-02 03:42:50 Try another oil like jojoba
9021 2018-08-02 03:42:09 どんな色合いになるか、楽しみにしております！
9022 2018-08-02 03:42:08 Please share it @albertapodnet . We work hard and just did an episode with Podcast Legend @josiahhughes . We also work on genuine Alberta oil field
9023 2018-08-02 03:41:51 How about demanding FULL FUNDING of the Land & Conservation Act that Rob Bishop is trying to kill? You supported it strongly as a Cong. Rep. Now you have become a worthless shill for oil-gas-coal.

9026 2018-08-02 03:41:13 Why, McDonald's, where he enjoys his "Fish Delight" (an early lie; the guy can't keep himself from fibbing, even about the junk food that's turning his ass into a oil barrel).
9027 2018-08-02 03:40:44 Keep in mind the Clinton economy was sluggish until a Republican forced cap gains TX cut in ' 96 AND AN incredible stroke of luck...$ 10 /Barrel oil,which acted like a tax cut .Revenues grew greatly with the TX cut stimulus..just like they will now!
9028 2018-08-02 03:40:40 一番推しはますみくんだけど、二番が紬さんかシトロンで揺れる
9029 2018-08-02 03:40:38 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9030 2018-08-02 03:40:38 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9031 2018-08-02 03:40:33 ตอนแรกยังลังเล แต่ตอนนี้พี่ยอมแล้วจ้ะ พี่จะหาบัตรไปให้ได้
9032 2018-08-02 03:40:31 Walaupun kebanyakan masa Mineral Oil dan Petrolatum boleh sumbatkan pori-pori untuk kulit muka berminyak dan menyebabkan breakout -- ianya masih bergantung atas jenis produk.

Kalau ingredients tersebut ada dalam cleansers atau facial scrub, it shouldn't be any issue.
9033 2018-08-02 03:40:15 Coconut oil is really good. It's antifungal, antibacterial, anti inflammatory, antiviral, it's edible. I love it.
9034 2018-08-02 03:40:13 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
9035 2018-08-02 03:40:11 Hmmm we have Oil man's Power and Oil man's theme..... but im still waiting for Oil man himself.
9036 2018-08-02 03:40:08 Because to cook spaghetti you literally just boil water and drop it in for a minute with some olive oil. Ez as fuck
9037 2018-08-02 03:39:32 ななとさんの美しさが前面に出るアイコンを期待しております！
9038 2018-08-02 03:39:28 But on a serious note a full body oil massage would be nice right now ! 
9039 2018-08-02 03:39:26 I need a foot rub. Preferably with some oil/lotion . I bet some of you would love to do that for me 
#fetish #footgoddess #footfetish #feetpics #feetvids #footpics #footfetishnation
9040 2018-08-02 03:39:25 Same dark philosophy he has with abolishing ERA. He's killing us & the world by ignoring the massive destruction:
Hurricanes, Floods, Wildfires that change Weather; countless other things like ignoring lead in water; defunding public schools, formerly #ProtectedLands 2 favor oil.
9041 2018-08-02 03:39:24 Like the drops of oil collected or not collected like the ten virgins
9042 2018-08-02 03:39:15 revealed: every time the 45th president breathes heavily, a butterly dies a slow emotional death
9043 2018-08-02 03:39:06 It’s an easy distraction for Cult 45... they see boobs in a bikini and something about owning the Libs and they’re all in. It doesn’t matter if she’s selling snake oil, as long as the libtards say it’s wrong, it’s “right” to them. Morans.
9044 2018-08-02 03:39:03 whew it’s a carrying CBD oil in my purse kinda week
9045 2018-08-02 03:38:58 Did you oil your abs?
9046 2018-08-02 03:38:58 Father, can you explain the oil stock a bit more?  I have never heard of the oil stock but understand from inference what it represents.
9047 2018-08-02 03:38:56 Thanks for us taking an hour to swallow coconut oil
9048 2018-08-02 03:38:49 えっっかわいすぎません？？？
9049 2018-08-02 03:38:30 By the while even concentrate little towards Maruthi Sevanagar and Indian oil sir
9050 2018-08-02 03:38:29 I have PTSD with extreme social anxiety. I also have general anxiety from it,  too.  It is the very best treatment. It totally takes away the PTSD nightmares and sleepwalking.  

I use CBD oil during the day and it also helps. 

I have 2 chronic pain conditions. It helps it.
9051 2018-08-02 03:38:28 Hello Barack can we speak at some point? Do you have time for me? I mean the human version of me? He has a way to help you America and the world. To end the need for oil  to create & unlimited energy supply with no waste & renewable water & artficial gravity. All perpetual motion
9052 2018-08-02 03:38:10 You can buy oil diffusers that plug into a car charger socket.  Mine has helped me a ton!
9053 2018-08-02 03:37:42 That oil change took longer than it should have.
9054 2018-08-02 03:37:40 im like the people that get into snake oil health scams except i get into basic shit you buy at CVS
9055 2018-08-02 03:37:07 To power current electricity demand, 1/4 to 1/3 of the Continental US would have to be covered in wind and solar farms. That is FAR more damaging to the environment than oil and coal could ever be.
9056 2018-08-02 03:37:05 Well, I was trying to think of something clever
You were saying nothing whatsoever
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil
(Some Swedish Trees, the Mountain Goats)
9057 2018-08-02 03:36:44 I use peppermint oil on my temples and behind my ears for headaches too. Works great!
9058 2018-08-02 03:36:29 I remember when coconut oil became the wave and girls were putting that shit on everything, my sister got it confused with VEGETABLE OIL and soaked her hair in it  that shit was greasy for a solid week
9059 2018-08-02 03:35:50 I've prepared a umami trifle with honey, truffle oil, and cherry.
9060 2018-08-02 03:35:45 You want me to post my grades and DAT score?  My LSAT score?  Jesus bro.  You act like I’m lying.  My bad I’m oil field trash.
9061 2018-08-02 03:35:10 I was sitting in Pit Road Terrace, listening to the 18s in car channel. They asked him way he got in to 1 so deep. Kyle said there is oil everywhere. 
They told him to ease back down, the 2 is right there.

9073 2018-08-02 03:33:42 Instead of shipping oil by rail, as much of it is being done today, the pipeline will allow more prairie grain to be shipped to the coast. Pipelines are a much safer way to transport oil than rail.

9078 2018-08-02 03:32:59 Principled? Hardly. Misogynistic snake oil salesman more like.
9079 2018-08-02 03:32:54 I used to use it too. For about 10 years now, coconut oil has been my makeup remover of choice (more expensive though). Also makes my eyelashes grow 
9080 2018-08-02 03:32:53 "Lol, actually this snake oil tastes good and is curing my illnesses"
9081 2018-08-02 03:32:48 Oh damn! That stinks! Aloe will still work wonders, but a good alternative to tea tree oil is eucalyptus oil & lemongrass oil (diluted). I used eucalyptus on my industrial piercing
9082 2018-08-02 03:32:32 なるほど！

9083 2018-08-02 03:32:17 Someone told me today that they “cured” their diabetes with a special oil.

So there’s that.

9085 2018-08-02 03:31:59 Not changing the plugs, not changing the oil and running on empty will get ya every time. I can afford newer van. Mine is 23 yrs old at this point. Easier to maintain than ever getting a newer vehicle so far. I maintain old vans.
9086 2018-08-02 03:31:57 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
9087 2018-08-02 03:31:51 If it's longer than stubble, it can benefit from beard oil. Plus it gets rid of any beardruff you might get.

9092 2018-08-02 03:30:55 Here we go. Another Nordic idiot. They have 5 million people in those countries and are extremely homogenous and also have nationalized their oil and also WE pay their defense budget. Holy hell talk about irrelevant.
9093 2018-08-02 03:30:49 The thing is, the purpose of Cap and Trade is to make major polluters in Canada unprofitable. It is a way to shut the oil sands down. Is there a problem with that?
9094 2018-08-02 03:30:38 That’s your goddamn fault too btw.  I’m out of here long ago oil field three times trash.  You all get together and write me a check and I’ll consider it once I’ve seen the evidence Forrest Gumps

9097 2018-08-02 03:30:28 So far most people are adding my author profile as a friend on FB to immediately invite me to their group. Like, within 30 secs, and I’m thinking ohhhh you don’t want to know me, you want me to know YOU! It’s hurtin my feelings yo! (And they’re usually essential oil groups)
9098 2018-08-02 03:30:22 Just catching up on some tape from the Hlinka camp. I'm really liking Matt Robertson of the Edmonton Oil Kings. Crafty defender with a solid set of hands for his size.

9100 2018-08-02 03:29:50 This is ridiculously smooth for oil! Actually had to look up his other works to make sure they weren't photos.
9101 2018-08-02 03:29:46 Yes! Absolutely - North America needs to stop being dependent on oil from other countries when we have what we need here.
9102 2018-08-02 03:29:41 Fake insurance & universities, companies creating slaves, children no longer need to be literate, kidnapping & abusing kids, big oil & chemical still killing us, while sworn to uphold the law GOP & Rump's rob us blind. RUSSIA!

I can't take all this winning.
9103 2018-08-02 03:29:41 (21:10) “I don’t care what their circumstances are, we cannot take care of the whole world.” ...Unless, they have oil, then we’ll go to war for “them”.

9109 2018-08-02 03:27:53 They're surely could have been, but 5500 BCE is a little early for Western European Neolithic to produce enough flax for that usage. Down in Anatolia, for sure. You could also use walnut oil or animal fat

9133 2018-08-02 03:24:48 Oil falls 2 percent on rising supply, concern about trade tensions: Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Wednesday as a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles fed concerns about global oversupply, while investors worried that trade tensions could hit energy demand.

9151 2018-08-02 03:22:56 Why? Time to put down "Das Kapital" and pick up "Economics for Simpletons and Socialists". Time to retire! Go spend that fortune you made selling snake oil to whomever is naive enough to buy in!

9179 2018-08-02 03:17:14 We have oil because #money is vested there with high #monetary returns, not because oil is the most efficient or sustainable source of energy. #Money is an artificial metric. Vertical farms are being built but the logic of #MoneyThink favors vested interests. #MonetaryTrap

9193 2018-08-02 03:14:10 Raise oil prices then people start making choices. Buy gas with credit cards so you can get to work so you can pay your bills. When the bills out grow your income more choices are needed. Can the mortgage wait? Health insurance wait? Another recession is waiting in the wings.

9215 2018-08-02 03:11:46 Not saying the data is invalid, but it should be noted this report comes from an agency run by BP and supported by other oil companies.
9216 2018-08-02 03:11:41 Which is exactly what he wants. Oil is his boss' country's largest source of income. When cost goes up, Russia makes more money.

9225 2018-08-02 03:10:41 The reason why people come here from Mexico and Latin America because it's bad there. They want a safe place to live. If we stop focusing for oil in the middle east and focus in Mexico and Latin America, people won't come here. Just need to get rid of all the Dug dealers and more

9234 2018-08-02 03:09:44 Does anyone up in Fort Berthold have intel about the groundwater wells that were potentially contaminated with diesel fuel from nearby oil and gas wells? I have an old power point and a lot of dead ends. Is it a real thing?

9240 2018-08-02 03:08:17 to get the results that you are applauding he is doing what he has always done in business. Fucked over Peter to give to Paul. He has reduced spending on health, education and the environment. Supported big oil, Pharma and Wall Street. Trust me - he has no interest in you.
9241 2018-08-02 03:07:59 Peppermint oil. Just add it to you lotion (or calamine). It’s a life saver!!
9242 2018-08-02 03:07:51 Some nice snake oil u got there
9243 2018-08-02 03:07:44 Coconut oil, thats how I keep them supple.

9245 2018-08-02 03:07:33 Shhh (#hotflashes), lol! I was just earlier saying how (pepper)mint essential oil in a water spray bottle stimulates a tingly coolness, and in your scalp, the same thing, and stimulates hair growth, too! Two-for!!! I hope that helps?!
9246 2018-08-02 03:07:23 Eucalyptus oil or menthol will save you
9247 2018-08-02 03:07:15 Huge thank you to the Moonie Oil Fields for donating 1.2 million litres of water for stock to fill dry dam and tanks.

Bernie’s has. It’s over. In the 2016 campaign Bernie Boy would never answer key questions, one of which was how Will U pay 4 everything-no answer!
9250 2018-08-02 03:07:03 100% effort. What a joke.  Ever hear of fracking as a bridge to clean energy? Fracking shot up under Obama’s watch and he opened US oil to export markets. Turns out fracking warms the planet exponentially compared to co2 over a 100 year period. Obama didn’t do jack.
9251 2018-08-02 03:06:59 I am a game changer, I have enough oil on my life to shift my bloodline. SO DO YOU..
9252 2018-08-02 03:06:56 Quite a thing for a Premier robocalling the country a push poll on oil, to say though.
9253 2018-08-02 03:06:29 Looks like cooking oil
9254 2018-08-02 03:06:29 It's disturbing when some Pinos can be brainwashed so easily even when facts stare them right in their face.

9265 2018-08-02 03:04:46 Peppermint oil works as well. I keep a bottle for when I travel because TSA never fails to touch my hair.
9266 2018-08-02 03:04:35 I call the baby “roast pork” (in chinese) because the baby oil and her rolls of fat make me think of the glistening meat from the chinese butcher.

9277 2018-08-02 03:02:34 Have to be ecologically minded, the fish need shelter, Iran's navy will provide the shelter in the forms of artificial reefs courtesy of the US military. A big win for the fish & the coral...... after the oil spills of sunken oil tankers gets cleaned up that is.......

9289 2018-08-02 03:00:44 I wish we cared about our environment even half as much as our economy. But the economy can invest in "green jobs" like making solare panels. Right now, our government gives subsidies to oil companies!!!! Why???

9341 2018-08-02 02:53:58 So 16(?) multinational oil corporations have left Canada & Alberta since the NDP came to power. And you’re telling me that there’s no correlation?

9344 2018-08-02 02:53:46 Less drilling this year than last. Most of the Oil workers I know are sitting at home, still back in their home provinces or working jobs for considerably less money. There has been no oil recovery.

9349 2018-08-02 02:53:02 Only real downside is cost I think. Pump oil is regularly far hotter than 65, and has a high flash point. I like @ClarkGroupChem’s idea of glycerin though! 

Use sand?
9350 2018-08-02 02:52:54 MAKEUP HELP if I use some light facial oil (grapeseed/almond) and then put on BB cream will it mess up? Or should I just use a regular moisturizer

9489 2018-08-02 02:32:48 Love that baby (and try CBD oil.. it can really help with pain and appetite. Not a cure, but making them feel good is so important.)
9490 2018-08-02 02:32:32 Baby oil back in 1987 still reminds me of those days. That's what I used back then to tan. The good ole days.
9491 2018-08-02 02:32:31 Vegan cosmetic is fine for me 
Even HAKAN's oil is nice to cleanser!

9494 2018-08-02 02:32:22 and provide for those who grieve in Zion- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks ..ISAIAH 61:3
9495 2018-08-02 02:32:20 The oil is sourced from a controlled farm in Colorado, but I assume the product itself is shipped from PDX, yes.
9496 2018-08-02 02:32:12 What about black seed oil?!
9497 2018-08-02 02:32:10 Yes right behind that old oil Derrick. Is my favorite spot this time of year in about 5 or 6 foot of water. Using fresh shad and punch bait. Formulated by danny king . not the stuff that has his name on it now. Lol.
9498 2018-08-02 02:32:09 skg ni masalah kulit aku klu bkn kering, too oily ja. mcm ikut cuaca..tp aku jumpa jg solusinya..haha..time panas gila, aku letak face oil lebih dan minum air lebih. klu musim biasa tu, face oil time mlm ja, clay mask 2 kali seminggu. gitu ja. jerawat nda suda jd masalah.
9499 2018-08-02 02:32:06 Lane Kiffin is a snake oil salesman ... you think urban was sneaky? Lane would be the WORST mistake in buckeye history
9500 2018-08-02 02:31:51 I didn’t realize this wasn’t common knowledge - parents: add tea tree oil and lavender to your shampoo/conditioner spray at the start of the year for lice prevention as the kids head back.  It’s a hardcore repellant.
9501 2018-08-02 02:31:33 Bring the mixture to a boil
Coat the fish with olive oil
9502 2018-08-02 02:31:30 There is something about Chippewa Falls air , the combination of river water, beer, oil and cigarettes will always intrigue me
9503 2018-08-02 02:31:27 If this is a crime , fashion week should be raided and everyone given life sentences.
9504 2018-08-02 02:31:18 That as you wear it, it absorbs your essence and changes colours. It’s not supposed to change colour lol. Dirt/oil just gets trapped on the surface
9505 2018-08-02 02:31:18 I just have to get something off my chest and it might cost me everything I have...

Toast with olive oil and honey is the shit
9506 2018-08-02 02:31:11 @VinnieTortorich I saw Carlson fish oil on your amazon page. Is fish oil something you take daily and is that something PVC is working on?
9507 2018-08-02 02:30:56 How do you become a Disney princess in oil country  and where did you get this burger and fries I must know
9508 2018-08-02 02:30:54 I had this tonight with my pan-fried salmon (easier than steak since there is no butter or oil involved) and potato salad.  It's a 2016 and at 12.30 a bottle a really good deal.  A lot more sugar than yours but a really tasty summer wine.

9516 2018-08-02 02:29:47 Mining of rare earth minerals for batteries isn’t any better for the environment than coal.  Then there’s evil oil, evil nuclear, evil everything else.  Renewables don’t have the portability of fossil fuels.  You can’t launch a satellite into space on wind power.
9517 2018-08-02 02:29:41 Kleveru grapeseed buat jadi cleansing oil, gils mantep bat daki-daki di muka keangkat terus abis dibilas pake air+fw muka jadi lembut bgt dong berasa bersih mukaku jadinya
9518 2018-08-02 02:29:37 Do you seriously want an answer?  The money to green the province means that tax payers have to pay more taxes to employ workers. If Alberta sells oil, the workers are paid by foreign money and everybody is richer. Govt should regulate clean extraction.
9519 2018-08-02 02:29:35 Input tea tree oil in my bath and wowie. There are some feelings going on in here
9520 2018-08-02 02:29:28 please don’t let me stay up until 4am tonight i have to get my oil changed tomorrow morning at goddamn o’clock and then work 11a-10p
9521 2018-08-02 02:29:25 @Weichert45 My suggestion for the Federal Government to save money was to stop the Oil and Gas theft from landowners in the Appalachian States/Counties, then the government could stop paying Millions to Appalachia each year.

O&G Companies have always stolen from US Landowners.
9522 2018-08-02 02:29:04 Coconut oil?

Yes
9523 2018-08-02 02:28:58 Kinda wanna try my luck on the oil rigs now 
9524 2018-08-02 02:28:55 다 때려치고.. 싶다..... 젠장...
9525 2018-08-02 02:28:46 Thanks.  They seem to be going for the peanut butter.  They cleaned a butter wrapper in the trash such that it had no oil left on it.
9526 2018-08-02 02:28:42 Oh dear, naïve skides, you wouldn't put mashed potatoes on ice cream would you? It's the same principal, the weird bland flavor of potatoes doesn't mesh well with ice cream flavor, even if salt and peanut oil is added in the mix, there's too much going on palette-wise.

9528 2018-08-02 02:28:13 And you Republicans want to sell it off peice by piece for oil, gas, mining and free grazing.
9529 2018-08-02 02:28:12 You would think that the mileage on the Zaku 3 would be better but for some reason it runs on peanut oil?

Do you know how much that costs in Von Braun?
9530 2018-08-02 02:28:12 Randy , what’s your stance on oil and gas??
9531 2018-08-02 02:28:07 Global Cues: Oil Fell 1.6%, Settling at $67.66/bbl
9532 2018-08-02 02:28:06 Get some cloves/ground clove/clove oil and rub it on the tooth + area.. it'll at least ease the pain.
9533 2018-08-02 02:28:02 some day I hope to have passionate feelings about motor oil brands

Snake oil.
9537 2018-08-02 02:27:10 hace como 4 fines de semana que no salgo y ahora el sábado abre fuel oil. no saben la manija que tengoooo
9538 2018-08-02 02:26:43 @Pink putting a teaspoon of olive oil and holding it in your mouth for 15 minutes can help with a sore throat if you have one.
9539 2018-08-02 02:26:29 got stuff for an oil change for my truck now that i get home i dont even want to touch the damn thing
9540 2018-08-02 02:26:21 When I see older adults on Facebook complaining about sleep, anxiety, etc.. I just want to comment “CBD Oil” and that’s all.. I don’t want all that trouble tho honestly
9541 2018-08-02 02:26:14 Did it have fresh oil tho is the real question
9542 2018-08-02 02:26:07 Wtf okay never ever use body wash to wash your hair I just had to use half a bottle of argon oil to fix my shit.
9543 2018-08-02 02:26:00 *Spray your inner thighs with perfume. Only one push. (You don’t want it melting like alcohol).

*You can also use lavender or jasmine oil between thighs.

*Put on matching bra and panties. It’s cuter and he’ll be ready to devour you.
9544 2018-08-02 02:24:33 How are they handling the big oil boom in North Dakota? They had a ton of work is coming up there and had a lot of places for them to live. They build more houses and apartment buildings.  It isn’t rocket science. Supply and demand.
9545 2018-08-02 02:24:05 Feel like I just got a oil change.
9546 2018-08-02 02:24:00 My dad takes a shot of whiskey before he tees off. He calls it “aiming oil”
9547 2018-08-02 02:23:58 @Melaleuca’s 1/3 drive + 2/3 cedar wood essential oil combo is a midsummer night’s dream
9548 2018-08-02 02:23:40 Get well soon! As someone who has stomach surgery and sustained scarring, I have some advice. Use Vitamin E Oil after showers and before going to bed. It helps lighten the scars! Eventually you will learn to love them though
9549 2018-08-02 02:23:35 For the love of god people, stop wearing Petuli oil.  It smells like something rotting in a basement.
9550 2018-08-02 02:23:34 I can redirect you two someone who can help you replace that '09....(hi).  

...I can also redirect you to someone who can change its oil! (Not me)
9551 2018-08-02 02:23:10 anyway she busted into my apt when i almost started an oil fire making pierogis so i owe her a life debt and can't do anything about it

9556 2018-08-02 02:22:38 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. Either that, or put it on eBay
9557 2018-08-02 02:22:36 Everyone’s skin is different but peppermint oil is great for spot treatment and I will forever love anything with charcoal!!! black masks/strips are the bomb

9562 2018-08-02 02:22:18 We have crumbling infrastructure and the money to fix it goes to defense, for more wars. We have aquifers that are diminishing supplies & big oil wants to frack the aquifers to make more $. We have a greedy, ignorant gov. Let's change that. VOTE BLUE

9566 2018-08-02 02:21:41 Don't pay any attention to him. He doesn't live in our real world. He's trying to sell some snake oil himself.
9567 2018-08-02 02:21:40 Dick pics would be a less annoying if you actually put some effort in. Find decent lighting, turn on HDR, get a backdrop that isn't an open toilet, oil that thing up

*Shave your legs with oil and  with conditioner. If you use oil,it can make the condom thinner.

*lotion your skin with good smelling lotion from Victoria secret,etc.
9569 2018-08-02 02:21:36 First, they gave it to Iran, not isis.
Secondly, no, I didn't complain. It was there Money, from the sale of their oil, that we confiscated.  We used their money to bargain them to stop their nuclear program, and it worked. Cool eh? Until Dumpster f+*ked it up.
9570 2018-08-02 02:21:23 I got to get an oil change and a wheel alignment  whew chile.. the struggle
9571 2018-08-02 02:21:09 really wanna learn more about cars..mechanic wise..idk its just something about working on cars that's soothing to me, i like getting my hands dirty! i like changing my own oil, or my tires or battery, spark plugs etc.. i just love knowledge about anything period! lol.
9572 2018-08-02 02:21:01 Oh you don't have oil field wife stickers all over your car like they do here?

9575 2018-08-02 02:20:43 @Pink tea tree oil is  all natural and works wonders with your sinuses and a healing agent, Kills infection as well.
9576 2018-08-02 02:20:38 I love you too, but I'm gonna mace you in the nude oil painting.
9577 2018-08-02 02:20:37 I might have to make a little video - lots of YouTube vids tho.  Just make sure to get one with good reviews :). Some are duds and some want you to add like a TBSP of oil.  Mine is no oil!
9578 2018-08-02 02:20:30 Rinsed the salt scrub off my feet, smoothed night cream on my face, and tried a new combo in my essential oil diffuser #old #happysleep
9579 2018-08-02 02:20:22 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
9580 2018-08-02 02:20:05 I’m sure one of your other loyal followers gave you a solution but you can also go to Oil Changers and they will see how fine you are and just give you air for free. Works for me when I have a fresh haircut.
9581 2018-08-02 02:19:57 If Iran by military means blocks the Persian Gulf it won't last more than a week or two. That's not enough time for oil prices to skyrocket.
9582 2018-08-02 02:19:53 The US oil boom is the result of fracking. Alberta oil is extracted from oil sands , extraction cost is higher and oil quality is not as good. Pipeline capacity is another issue for Alberta.
9583 2018-08-02 02:19:52 Something you could look for that's usually inexpensive, is all natural & safe to bath them in is "neem oil", it discourages fleas, lice & ticks, & also helps to clear up mange & ringworm. It's safe enough to even bath guinea pigs in!
9584 2018-08-02 02:19:52 Looking forward to your next video “we went to the Middle East looking for peace, but all we found was oil”.

9587 2018-08-02 02:19:25 hey siri how many times can you accidentally rub peppermint oil into your eyes before you do permanent damage
9588 2018-08-02 02:19:14 Essential oil sales people are literally a cult.
9589 2018-08-02 02:19:11 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9590 2018-08-02 02:19:11 Coconut oil?? Like the stuff you use to cook with???
9591 2018-08-02 02:19:11 I promised myself I'd disconnect from markets while on vacation, haven't been able to because there has been so many interesting ERs and CCs, and macro has also been interesting (oil, yields,USD coiling)
9592 2018-08-02 02:19:04 i put too much baby oil on my body i could deadass slip and die
9593 2018-08-02 02:19:01 the United States don't need to steal oil. and even if they can influence the oil strategy in one way or another, #Iran has been draining Iraq's money for 15 years. all Iraqi leaders are Iranian proxies that serve Iran befor Iraq.
9594 2018-08-02 02:18:47 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
9595 2018-08-02 02:18:42 My skin is so dry and itchy!!!! Coco butter and coconut oil thank the lord for you

9599 2018-08-02 02:18:19 One eye closed. "Why?" you wonder? Well, I do an oil cleanse & I decided to add tea tree & peppermint oils to kill all the bacteria that may be lurking. I got carried away & got a little too close to my eye. I didnt get it IN my eye, but TT oil is strong. Lol
9600 2018-08-02 02:18:14 3) there is also evidence that they believed in an “oil spot” theory - they obviously could not impose democracy by force on every problematic state, so they picked the one they thought had the best chance of democratizing successfully and becoming influential

9601 2018-08-02 02:18:06 Nah telling someone to rub oil on their titties - sexual harassment
9602 2018-08-02 02:18:05 Lol to tell the truth I understand them. But they're still subtitled on TV. It's funny. (I watched that show Backyard Oil. It was hilarious to see what got subtitled)
9603 2018-08-02 02:17:49 아 진짜 짜증나네
9604 2018-08-02 02:17:36 So Russia liquidates its US treasury investments and now its surrogate Iran blocks oil shipments- is anyone getting this- hello Washington?
9605 2018-08-02 02:17:35 No,you will hate it,inhale peppermint oil vapour in hot water with a towel over your head darlin
9606 2018-08-02 02:17:33 YAY the sale ends 8/5. And my critical-thinking brain insists to me it's just the argan oil, glycerin, and squalene in it, but my magical-thinking brain is certain it's the ancient concoction of traditional herbs blah blah. So it's probably not MAGIC. (Except that IT'S MAGIC.)
9607 2018-08-02 02:17:06 ㅎ뭔소리야 나는 그대로 나갈거고
그때 안오면 대회고 뭐고 다 때려칠거야
9608 2018-08-02 02:16:35 Yes and flooding is also an effect due to the change in rainfall. Let's talk abt getting off fossil fuels (CO2) especially Tar sands oil. Stop Line 3 and No Polymet.
9609 2018-08-02 02:16:27 Ted Cruz is the epitome of a snake oil salesman.
9610 2018-08-02 02:16:12 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
9611 2018-08-02 02:16:08 Who wants to take my car to get its oil changed for me? Any takers? No? Okay, fine...... I’ll do it myself

9615 2018-08-02 02:15:53 Yeah, he allowed more animals to be sacrificed so that his dopey sons can bring home trophies.  He is allowing oil drilling in our beautiful parks.  He spends money hand over fist on his golf trips and ego-boosting rallies. And, and...... He's doing "wonderful."  Yeah, right.
9616 2018-08-02 02:15:43 This is what #Putin wants.  @realDonaldTrump is just following orders.  Sanctions and low oil prices choke off Russia.  Trump is not imposing sanctions and raising oil prices by his hapless actions.  exactly what they want!
9617 2018-08-02 02:15:31 True. But there are still all those Great Lakes to poison with oil spills and invasive species and they haven’t completely destroyed the education system yet. Another 4 years of GOP rule should finish the state.

9620 2018-08-02 02:15:20 Part of the question: if admitting a betrayal Mackay as an academic Oil is an igneous protrusion out Land has become one
9621 2018-08-02 02:15:04 2) there is clear and compelling evidence (papers by Wolfowitz et al) that they believed that spreading democracy to the ME would kill multiple birds w one stone (secure trade access to oil, reduce terrorism, reduce threat to Israel). They were *wrong*, but they believed it.

9629 2018-08-02 02:13:58 You really need to see all savings Scotland will have in Indy, after all 96% of oil is in Scotland's maritime waters, that will come back to Scotland and these tax revenues will go into Scotland's pot, not WM, since England also needs Scotland's water AND renewables electricity
9630 2018-08-02 02:13:32 @susipudjiastuti @Menlu_RI @fadlizon @Fahrihamzah @bank_indonesia @karniilyas The decline in oil prices also lowered the acceptance of the APBN, where 60 percent came from the Company's taxes.

9661 2018-08-02 02:09:08 Of all the thousands of dollars of free shit I recently inherited from this chick, I think my favourite is the two giant bottles of olive oil which I assume cost a fortune because I’ve never even considered buying even one bottle that large, nevermind two.
9662 2018-08-02 02:08:59 Maybe but I can use domestic oil

-sunbutter, soy sauce, ginger, scallions, Serrano chili peppers (optional), lemongrass, curry powder = Thai-inspired "peanut" curry

9715 2018-08-02 02:01:32 You clearly haven't been paying attention.  Oil and energy companies have been pushing for carbon taxes for years.  In Alberta the energy industry was lobbying for a carbon tax well before NDP came to power.  Look it up.

9717 2018-08-02 02:01:16 We had $100 oil during a time where you can buy a home in nyc for HALF of what it is today.  Do you really believe that oil can survive $100 at a time when every nation is trying to unwind its debt and raise rates?

9721 2018-08-02 01:59:14 Happy to share knowledge from Economics degree. Think of economy as engine with many parts, & oil is the interest rate. Invariably in normal times, some parts need more oil and some less. The central bank evaluates all parts & makes a small change best for the system as a whole.
9722 2018-08-02 01:59:06 The idea that oil cannot pass through canal is not good. But maybe the appearance of electric cars will be expedited.

Not this CBD oil from shops that’s no good, it’s just a food supplement.
9778 2018-08-02 01:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪

9782 2018-08-02 01:50:53 We obviously still need things like oil because we can’t fully power the country with the limited clean and nuclear energy plants we have but we shouldn’t be focusing on somehow getting back imaginary coal jobs or investing more in oil like trump wants.
9783 2018-08-02 01:50:51 But your joints. Get that oil bath tho

9785 2018-08-02 01:50:32 BSP expects consumer prices to rise within 5.1%-5.8% y/y in
July on increases in electricity and water rates in the Philippine
capital and nearby provinces, higher oil and rice prices,
increases in fares and tobacco excise tax could have led to
upward price pressures
9786 2018-08-02 01:49:57 Just look ok at the keystone pipeline. People warned them over and over again that it would hurt the environmen, not to mention the fact that it went through Native American lands. And look what happened. Soon after it opened there was an oil spill.

9788 2018-08-02 01:49:38 Oh look. #Neanderthals in their natural habitat. Make no sudden moves, or they may charge. If you want to feed them, just THROW them fatback dipped in salt and drano and sautéed in motor oil.
9789 2018-08-02 01:49:37 fry them in oil, they aren't prepared for that
9790 2018-08-02 01:49:30 Estupidez de estupidez absoluta crudo oil superficial.

9792 2018-08-02 01:49:25 Sometimes when I take my mass amounts of vitamins, mid way through, I forget to swallow and worry that I’ll just choke to death on fish oil and milk thistle.
9793 2018-08-02 01:49:14 Its the leaked oil under the stadium
9794 2018-08-02 01:49:14 I got similar Oil kit...I never thought of it as a "Wedding Ring"..
9795 2018-08-02 01:49:07 Had a panic moment. But I got around to putting some olive oil in my ear. It stopped buzzing but hasn't come out.
9796 2018-08-02 01:49:01 How is that big boy doing? Toby has one treatment left, he is doing well and taking his oil too!
9797 2018-08-02 01:48:48 It’s very difficult to advocate for the deregulation of heavy polluting companies and big oil while claiming you support green energy.
9798 2018-08-02 01:48:33 When its 107 degrees outside,I freeze grapes and eat them like tasty ice cubes.

9800 2018-08-02 01:48:23 I use black castor oil or coconut oil. Coconut industry board, and Earth Elements.
9801 2018-08-02 01:48:23 Over 3 billion# annually in subsidies to oil and gas (this is the same PM that stood high on his platform for climate change ....and he bought a useless, soon-to-be out of date pipeline) He is a drama teacher with no business running this country.
9802 2018-08-02 01:48:02 I have three different bottles of cutting board oil btw. Used one of them once.
9803 2018-08-02 01:48:01 me: “vance can you ask mommom if i can have her olive garden”
vance: “can aliyah have your almond garlic oil”
9804 2018-08-02 01:47:55 おはよー
9805 2018-08-02 01:47:55 Worse than snake oil, the fake freedom of trumpcare will be.
9806 2018-08-02 01:47:33 I use the electricity in my house. And politicians on both sides, largely the right, have been bought off by big oil companies for years. They are paid to vote against environmental safety bills that are also not “raping” the taxpayers.
9807 2018-08-02 01:47:20 The best investment I made was getting an oil pen
9808 2018-08-02 01:47:17 Is she a snake oil salesman?
9809 2018-08-02 01:47:13 Oh ima thank yes it’s the oil burner! But I’m going to get a diffuser, i think i seen some at bed bath and beyond but if they work good i want one, i love fresh smells omg
9810 2018-08-02 01:47:03 Ant Navy Increases Activity Near Key Oil Choke Point, Prompts Warning From Pentagon
9811 2018-08-02 01:46:40 Good God...even a Talk Show host is a stretch. He is a Huckster Snake Oil Saleman who looks and act like the Center ring anouncer in a circus. His place in history will end up only as the punchline to a joke. Irrelevant and unimportant.
9812 2018-08-02 01:46:34 @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump both want gas prices to soar.  Then they can start drilling oil in the Arctic in Alaska and make $ as that is all they care about.
9813 2018-08-02 01:46:24 Trump must be heavily invested in oil.
9814 2018-08-02 01:46:16 And sadly, Jim, when the FOX NEWS banner is scrolling across the bottom of the page his watchers can't seem to distinguish between news and entertainment.
His DEFCOM warning was hilarious.  He's a roadside carnival snake oil peddler at best.
9815 2018-08-02 01:46:08 No way @calgarytransit brings in someone who trashes the oil sector when a large number of their passengers work in the sector.
9816 2018-08-02 01:46:03 Worst tension headache ever  I’ve basically covered my entire head in peppermint oil and this shit ain’t working

9818 2018-08-02 01:45:29 We emphasize in the supply of high quality materials mainly to Engineering Fabricators, Contractors, Petrochemical Industries, Power Station, Oil Refineries, and Oil & Gas Industries.

9820 2018-08-02 01:45:17 Matt contact OPITO in Aberdeen for apprenticeships for the oil and gas industry, 2 years at college in Aberdeen then offshore for your proper training.   Its worth a punt.
9821 2018-08-02 01:45:11 That’s a lot of oil. You could acccomplish the same thing with 1/3rd the oil.
9822 2018-08-02 01:45:05 おはありー
9823 2018-08-02 01:45:01 I have some Trivia for you:  Is the western slope part of Colorado? It is... Why are you afraid to attend the Club 20 debate?  Too many tough questions about trying to kill the oil and gas industry...  I hope the voters learned something about #PolisWrongForCO today!
9824 2018-08-02 01:44:55 i love the coffee plus coconut oil mask at walmart. it smells good too
9825 2018-08-02 01:44:49 u can sell the oil and the snake to buy a good book to learn somthing.
9826 2018-08-02 01:44:15 Are we getting our oil from Iran..I thought it was Saudi Arabia?
9827 2018-08-02 01:43:46 There's a difference between educate and inform, and debate. When you debate fact--is ice cold? Let's debate it! Does boiling oil on skin hurt? Let's debate it!--you put doubt in the mind of people who knew something as fact. It's a form of gaslighting.
9828 2018-08-02 01:43:32 I have so much olive oil rn
9829 2018-08-02 01:43:19 Nope. I gotta’ change my oil.
9830 2018-08-02 01:43:17 ごま油、タンスの角に指ぶつけろ。
9831 2018-08-02 01:43:01 The carbon "tax" will in fact save money, albeit over a long period of time. Conservatives don't like it because they prefer mollifying oil interests to improving the environment.
9832 2018-08-02 01:42:54 エアコン止めるの３時間が限界だな・・・よかった、ウチ、レオパレスじゃなくて。
9833 2018-08-02 01:42:52 Just regular castor oil ?
9834 2018-08-02 01:42:50 ต้องทนไปอีก 6 เดือน แต่ความรู้สึกหลังจากนี้ต้องใช้เวลานานเท่าไหร่ ถึงจะโอเค
9835 2018-08-02 01:42:31 Cocoa nut oil
9836 2018-08-02 01:42:30 Castor oil
9837 2018-08-02 01:42:29 A cup of bread crumbs, an egg, a cup of shredded zucchini. A teaspoon of garlic salt. Mix and drop into pan to cook on both sides. Use olive oil, just enough to cover the pan. Even the kids might eat it. They should look like mini pancakes.
9838 2018-08-02 01:42:12 But you will find olive oil, or vegetable oil sometimes. I know Hellman's has an ingredient list a mile long, but Mayo is just egg yolk, an acid, an oil, and mustard.
9839 2018-08-02 01:42:10 The anti-Hindu forces are very very strong with financial backing from the Vatican and Saudi oil money. This is a force that has to be reckoned with. Chrislam wants to irradicate Hinduism at any cost.
9840 2018-08-02 01:41:58 I’ll buy Papa John’s  , Pizza Hut wings, put Castrol Motor oil in my car and I’ll drink a Budweiser every weekend.  Millions of service members have said that they fought for their right to kneel. As long as they’re not a disruption, I’m okay with it.
9841 2018-08-02 01:41:41 So, I cook chicken adobo yesterday for the fam right? And my mom's mentions that she doesn't eat meat... Cool. I toasted a fajita, threw Jasmine rice on it, sauteed onion, bell, sweet, & jalapeño peppers in minced garlic cloves, olive oil, and salt and pepper, right? She smashed.
9842 2018-08-02 01:41:30 Nah, a diffuser makes a a scented mist with water and the oil. But you can def put them on a wax warmer too
9843 2018-08-02 01:41:16 bread & olive oil/lemon/garlic dressing. or garbanzo beans idk hang on
9844 2018-08-02 01:41:12 Because Trump says it’s fake, it’s fake? Or are you actually watching CNN to see?
I’m guessing it’s just buying the line from the snake oil salesman in the White House...
9845 2018-08-02 01:41:04 This is a bold tweet of course you are correct about Sean Hannity he is like a snake oil salesman and he is preaching to the choir on Fox News. He is a liar and I believe there are skeletons in his closet. Keep up the faith Jim.
9846 2018-08-02 01:40:15 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
9847 2018-08-02 01:40:14 Typically means something petroleum based is burning. Could be rubber, an oil derrick (though not possible here in Oregon), gas tank, gas station... Tends most often to be vehicles.
9848 2018-08-02 01:39:56 Wait are the diffuser the same as the oil burners ?? Cause if not then I’m talking about the burners
9849 2018-08-02 01:39:56 You know nothing about me, you just pretend you do. It gives you a sense of being somehow better. Look this up: Kim Paddock v. in federal court. I have been fighting people like you for years. Come and find me if you're so great. I am the truly anointed one by the Holy oil. AMEN.

9855 2018-08-02 01:38:57 D: cannibis oil?
9856 2018-08-02 01:38:53 Random person: have you tried putting ____ on your eczema?
Me: *looks in pain at my 757867 different steroid ointments, vitamin e oil, witch hazel and many dermatologist appointments* 
I’ll try that! 

Because why talk to people like they’re dumb when their intentions are pure??
9857 2018-08-02 01:38:50 At least she has the decency to feel weird about using olive oil since it’s extra virgin
9858 2018-08-02 01:38:36 "Oatmeal and olive oil"?!?! Is this Goop? 
I do sweet 24/7. I really need to cut that back haha. Your menu sounds so healthy!
9859 2018-08-02 01:38:26 A probiotic & tea tree oil, if you are going to do the probiotic I would suggest a natural one & keeping them in your fridge the tea tree oil should also be diluted in a bath or a spray, or just using it to rinse off in the bath.
9860 2018-08-02 01:38:13 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."
9861 2018-08-02 01:38:09 I’ve been SO productive today, I made breakfast, did ALL my laundry, taught myself how to change the oil in my car, and I have my start date for start class. 
9862 2018-08-02 01:38:04 I need tea tree oil rubbed all down my body
9863 2018-08-02 01:37:51 and let’s remember that the alternative to the pipeline also places the resident orcas at increased risk and an oil-by-rail spill could kill off the salmon runs these orcas rely on to survive.
9864 2018-08-02 01:37:46 Good luck!!!
9865 2018-08-02 01:37:37 No oil...... I'm sure took real good care of the rest of the car though...

9875 2018-08-02 01:35:51 Like the article says, polygraphs have been discredited. To claim otherwise is akin to selling snake oil
9876 2018-08-02 01:35:32 Put a warm drop of olive oil and hop on one foot on that side... it’ll come out
9877 2018-08-02 01:35:27 Parang gusto ko i-try yung castor oil pack.

Happy aromatic Ro.
9903 2018-08-02 01:32:58 Don't even talk to me unless you're at the "used dry shampoo on an oil stain to avoid doing laundry" level depression
9904 2018-08-02 01:32:55 I have exactly one loaf that I can make consistently (a basic white flour/olive oil loaf). Every time I try a variant, I'm a beginner again. But bread is SO MUCH FUN even when I screw it up.
9905 2018-08-02 01:32:45 Fox News was on in the gym.  Their hosts and guests doing the dance of making Trump seem normal has to be exhausting.  I have a lot of flaws but I’m so glad I’m not stupid enough to be tricked by those snake oil salesmen.
9906 2018-08-02 01:32:31 I believe that the oil patch turndown started before she became Premier . I am not a NDP supported but am not willing to get on the UPC bandwagon.
9907 2018-08-02 01:32:26 Am I the only person that doesn’t actually like the taste of Olive oil?
9908 2018-08-02 01:31:44 40% saturated provides chemical stability - lacking in soybean and canola oil - and, no, supplements lack co-factors that only whole food can provide. There is nothing 'bad' about saturated fat except the demonization by those who should know better...
9909 2018-08-02 01:31:40 social anxiety really pisses me off. i drove to go get my oil changed but i freaked out bc i didn’t know where to go and i felt stupid asking so i just left. if you think i’m going to talk to random people to help me w a simple task you are most definitely wrong.
9910 2018-08-02 01:31:38 But I bet his eyebrows are silky fucking smooth right now. I'm personally jealous.
Bush oil, though? 
9911 2018-08-02 01:31:31 Other thing, and this has been MAGIC at our house -- CBD oil! You can rub pure CBD oil into your sore muscles. They have a CBD cream there they use as well which is awesome. I have more on that subject, it's been an amazing health supplement to our fam.
9912 2018-08-02 01:31:27 Oil?
9913 2018-08-02 01:30:49 What stuff? Do you own a power station? An oil field. A railway network? If not, socialists aren’t interested in what you have.

9919 2018-08-02 01:29:51 Thought the FBI’s terrorism jurisdiction was confined to the United Snakes. The CIA’s history of stirring shiz across the globe as organized crime thugs for oil barons and banksters is pretty well documented.
9920 2018-08-02 01:29:50 Time to break out the oil
9921 2018-08-02 01:29:49 me: you don't even know the name of the lead actor in Beverly Hills Cop

(we are watching Supermarket Sweep and one of the clues is about Murphy oil or something)

Lilly: I do know. It's Murphy Brown!
9922 2018-08-02 01:29:37 I’m from NYC I am well aware of the con artist/ snake oil salesman in the W.H. I don’t need TV to tell me about #DonTheCon he is a man whore, horrible businessman and he inherited all his money never had to work for it!. #CULT45 led by Putin
9923 2018-08-02 01:29:34 これ以上はTwitterではやめとく
9924 2018-08-02 01:29:13 You can use butter instead of popping oil and get your salt that way
9925 2018-08-02 01:28:17 Big surprise after oil corps sabotage the electric car manufacture.  Get fracked, Jakey flakey.

9927 2018-08-02 01:28:11 @ChickfilA it’d be awesome if you didn’t fry your food in peanut oil
9928 2018-08-02 01:27:44 I thought you were the one for me but sometimes you have to learn that two separate things which are good on their own do not mix well

you were the oil to my water.
9929 2018-08-02 01:27:44 Been grilling eggplant with olive oil and herbs. Great stuff
9930 2018-08-02 01:27:39 I used tons of parsley and a little dill. Max sure your olive oil is light...not extra virgin.
9931 2018-08-02 01:27:26 I’m not allowed to use CBD oil because I’m still in the military! And the medicine I was on didn’t have much testing with pregnancy so I didn’t want to risk anything. But I’m most likely going to get back on it after I deliver!
9932 2018-08-02 01:27:26 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.

9934 2018-08-02 01:27:18 Women are suckers. We buy shit like “anti cellulite leggings” and pay $275 for an oil change.
9935 2018-08-02 01:27:12 บางทีการไม่คาดหวังมันก็ดีนะจะทักมาตอนไหนก็ได้ เลิกงานยัง ทำไมเลิกดึกจัง
9936 2018-08-02 01:26:55 Bc your claims of Marxist socialism will save the world...even tho it has FAILED EVERY SINGLE TIME...r fine tho right? As Venezuelans r eating rats. W more oil than any other country.
9937 2018-08-02 01:26:26 ทำไมคนเรามักจดจำสิ่งที่เจ็บปวด.
9938 2018-08-02 01:26:25 since 1948 disaster the UNRWA provided a ration to refugee and family consisting of measured amount of flour sugar and cooking oil only since #Gaza population is predominantly 1948 rufegee that could be the source of flour which US want to ban so you think they don’t deserve that
9939 2018-08-02 01:26:09 Prior to being elected she spent her entire career against oil development. Now her career is on the line it’s funny how pro pipeline her and her anti oil party members have to be.
9940 2018-08-02 01:25:51 I'll oil ya scalp
9941 2018-08-02 01:25:32 livin wild tonight eating at a place that cooks in peanut oil 
9942 2018-08-02 01:25:30 Constructed just to fill the void, you oil the machine
9943 2018-08-02 01:25:24 
9944 2018-08-02 01:25:13 Essential Oil Classes will start up in September!
9945 2018-08-02 01:25:06 At least you didn't spray yourself with coconut oil like I did tonight. Dont ask how
9946 2018-08-02 01:24:58 Done! Did the sucking and no spitting though.
9947 2018-08-02 01:24:37 I’m not trying to destroy your entire worldview here or anything, but I got the insulin resistant part from THE TITLE OF THE PAPER.  And I would also like to point out that all four groups got the exact same amount of soy oil.  
9948 2018-08-02 01:24:35 But even in regards to oil, Lynn must have seen it’s fair share of that shit with all the banger racing no? 
9949 2018-08-02 01:24:34 also guys, especially mommies,.. a super great insect repellent is clove oil!!! dilute it with some water like a 3/10 portion. mix it in a spray bottle and it works wonders!
9950 2018-08-02 01:24:06 On transfering fed lands to state, @Mark_Gordon_WY and @samforgovernor say nope, but more local control is the way to go. Gordon the question away from debating takeover to the mechanics could work better, like how overlap in oil and gas permitting is a problem in Wyo. #wyodebate
9951 2018-08-02 01:23:59 Let’s see how this new oil works on my hair.
9952 2018-08-02 01:23:58 Is climate change a hoax like Trump believes?  1000s of scientists from all over the world from countries large and small know that climate change is REAL.  The oil & gas industries are the only ones promoting climate change as a hoax....they want to make lots of money.
9953 2018-08-02 01:23:32 We just left the hotel for the long day, starting at the aquarium. As we left, we passed a huge array of oil tanks, by the Onahama refinery. Yuck. The thirst for petroleum after the Fukushima disaster is arguably a worse environmental disaster than the accident it is the fix for.
9954 2018-08-02 01:23:22 I wish I had more cbd oil. I can ask if they sell it at the pharmacy here. Probably not but who knows. In England you can buy it in the street these days.
9955 2018-08-02 01:22:49 i need to find a foundation that controls my oil
9956 2018-08-02 01:22:44 Pretty sure moon rocks are just nugs covered in hash oil and keif,which you can get at many a dispensary
9957 2018-08-02 01:22:31 dean@thebettingguy.co.uk sad sad times. This is the motivation behind all the free trades. Get all the followers then charge £27 a month. Just like the rest. Same as the Badger etc etc. Salesman selling the Snake  oil. Never mind
9958 2018-08-02 01:22:23 i shaved my legs w coconut oil earlier and i just got in the shower and BUSTED my ass because it’s so slippery. why me
9959 2018-08-02 01:22:18 So I put some lavender oil on the walls of my shower and y’all 
9960 2018-08-02 01:22:03 Amen
9961 2018-08-02 01:21:57 Is anyone surprised!  The only other vulgar and flagrant THEFT OF TAX PAYER MONEY and illegal war crimes for OIL and committing  GENOCIDE and invading sovereign nations was Bush and Cheney!  Why are they walking free?
9962 2018-08-02 01:21:47 @nitin_gadkari, we should estimate how much Deisal & Petrol. We loose because of bad roads, Traffic issue & toll barriers, Govt is paying subsidy, we  do start nationwide debate on this, Govt will save lot of money on imports of oil.
9963 2018-08-02 01:21:47 Angela says Sam's made at Rachel be ause she doesn't contribute...and also I guess left oil in a pan or some shit. #bb20
9964 2018-08-02 01:21:40 Looking more like this may not just be a drill on the Strait of Hormuz but Iran actually trying to stop all shipping according to latest intelligence. #OOTT #iran #WTI #oil

 Huffing oil’s, adjusting adorable babies  and ending the day with a visit from one of our patients to meet her pups  — feeling happy
9967 2018-08-02 01:21:30 Oil
9968 2018-08-02 01:20:56 Yep and it didnt start with this President..but with Cheney and both Bushes Halliburton and oil self dealing has become the norm
9969 2018-08-02 01:20:45 broke ass luna oil devotee here
9970 2018-08-02 01:20:32 Use Vitamin E or olive oil. The mark will be gone in no time hehehe
9971 2018-08-02 01:20:31 Its hard!!  i cut my rice, no sweet drinking, no oil, no ice. I eat boiled egg tho and veggie soup. Drink a lot of plain water! Exercise, but i dont work out too much. I just danced to bday song like 5-8 times in a day hehe bc its fun!! You should try tho 
9972 2018-08-02 01:20:21 stop putting on mascara! if you really wanna grow out your lashes, it helps to keep them nice and clean. instead apply some sort of oil to your lashes and brush them like a mascara, which will help them grow!
9973 2018-08-02 01:20:15 Who’d ever thought fractured palm kernel oil was so delicious? #chocolate
9974 2018-08-02 01:19:42 There are two kinds of clients. The ones that know what they want and the ones you guide to reach a goal. Any others are not clients at all and usually include the window shoppers, snake oil sellers, and control freaks.
9975 2018-08-02 01:19:16 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
9976 2018-08-02 01:19:12 @TuckerCarlson Your 'guest' re CA becoming a reservation is absolutely WRONG when he says Indians don't derive benefits from reservations.  Indians make GOBS OF MONEY from oil & gas leases on Indian lands most of the time operated by white people/companies.  Yr guest is a GOOF!
9977 2018-08-02 01:19:07 We do know that Kenney is going to take the rebates we're getting and give them to oil companies. So his system is not only ineffective, but it's unfair to consumers.
9978 2018-08-02 01:18:57 無慈悲に針抜かれて死ぬかと思ったけどそうでもなさそう？
9979 2018-08-02 01:18:49 My Dad started working at 8 years old, chose the oil field over college. Started his own tire shop, went on calls 24/7. Built his dream, and is successful with it. I'm sorry you don't have a new truck but I'm definitely not sorry my Dad busted his back to give me mine.
9980 2018-08-02 01:18:03 We were past it by having parents against vaccines because they thought they were snake oil or worse apparently.
9981 2018-08-02 01:17:51 疲れすぎてガヤる気力すら沸かなくなってきたので、最近はライブ行ってもむぎパートで前に出ることがなくなってしもうたのぉ( ￣-￣)

9982 2018-08-02 01:17:44 ไม่ค่อยชอบความผูกพันเท่าไหร่เลย
9983 2018-08-02 01:17:33 I too have a wacky theory. 

OIL below acts as a heat insulator between heat coming from earth's core below & protects the earth's surface. More oil we remove, more hot the sea & surface temperature will get. Plus CO2 & deforestation.
9984 2018-08-02 01:17:08 “Buy a diffuse for your essential oils”

*grabs my entire bottle of eucalyptus essential oil, puts it to one nostril with the cap off, covers my other nostril with one finger while I deeply inhale*

If this is how I die, so be it
9985 2018-08-02 01:17:01 Chef Louis cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with grass.
9986 2018-08-02 01:16:43 The 3rd pic is chile poblano. You cut a poblano pepper in half, remove seeds. In a bowl, mix flour, with salt & pepper. Flour the pepper, dip in beaten eggs, back in flour. Fry in pan with olive oil till cooked on both sides, and move to a pan.
9987 2018-08-02 01:16:41 Olympia bathing herself in oil and Serena exclaiming in French is the highlight of my day.
9988 2018-08-02 01:16:34 Use coconut oil to remove the stains :)
9989 2018-08-02 01:15:58 actually it's not very accurate -- seriously downplays role of big oil/coal and GOP supporters spending $ millions to deny climate change
9990 2018-08-02 01:15:53 use castor oil or olive oil and apply to your lashes. you can even mix them together which helps promote more growth! other uses like coconut oil, vaseline, and green tea help too!
9991 2018-08-02 01:15:50 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
9992 2018-08-02 01:15:39 京大北大の医学部物理必須化が何を意味してるか考えてみると楽しいよ！
9993 2018-08-02 01:15:38 When blent girl lights her blent and the light from her lighter reflects off the oil on her skin <3
9994 2018-08-02 01:15:35 Thats the beauty of sports.. you gotta play the games.. leiscter won a chapionship.. sports are crazy oil xould be 100 pont team or a 85 point team
9995 2018-08-02 01:15:31 No, it’s really not. But hearing anyone try to defend a treasonous snake oil salesman makes me sad.
9996 2018-08-02 01:15:30 None!  This one is no oil, just hot air!
9997 2018-08-02 01:15:27 Hot bath and coconut oil
9998 2018-08-02 01:15:21 McDonald's Cooked their Fries in 93% Beef Fat (Tallow) until 1990, when they Switched to Vegetable Oil.
9999 2018-08-02 01:15:13 It's not enough to keep fluid levels topped off when you get your oil checked.
Periodically, you need to have the transmission serviced 
10000 2018-08-02 01:15:07 That’s so true and on our farm we need to follow stricked rules that don’t allow us to put certain things on the fields. Also special tanks that wast water with chemicals go into when washing tractors and bikes. So how is it allowed to pore oil directly to the ground.
10001 2018-08-02 01:15:05 Snake oil!
10002 2018-08-02 01:15:02 How much oil did you use? I’ve been curious about these.
10003 2018-08-02 01:14:44 Softer than butter is his speech, but war is in his heart. Smoother than oil are his words, but they are unsheathed swords
