11 2019-02-21 23:55:50 If you folks want to learn more about orderflow.  Look at the actual mechanics of how orders are filled.  Remember ES is based on a STOCK index. Stocks trade and clear.  Check into it.
12 2019-02-21 23:54:01 A lot of bottles of ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce and philadelphia chesse before $KHC goes to bankruptcy. And maybe some stocks
13 2019-02-21 23:50:59 Mutual funds/bonds - low return but rarely lose money, stocks are (generally) opposite

18 2019-02-21 23:42:21 If nothing else, you can always use someone’s referral for Robinhood for 1 free stock even if you never use the app again. I keep getting referral stocks worth $3-4, but a friend got some worth like $50-60
19 2019-02-21 23:41:51 The Fed has done a 180. The fix is in. Short stocks at your own peril. We are playing the slowdown via the long bond and gold.
