6 2018-08-30 23:18:09 Collaboration is a no-brainer essential for producers of bulk commodities.
Reality is that niche market producers - in any industry - are directly competing with one another. 
I hope this distinction was made.

If interest rates increase, commodities rise and salaries remain stagnant, guess what, you’re not getting a raise. You’re getting a pay cut.

40 2018-08-30 22:19:31 men commit almost all crime more than women.  women are also more likely than men to to use sex and intimacy as bargaining chips or commodities and also lie exponentially more than men.  Not saying that justifies male crime, but just saying each sex has their lumps

45 2018-08-30 22:00:40 Unnecessary complication that delays adoption. Let's figure out how to do _a_ cloud before worrying about multi. Also, they aren't fungible commodities yet, so it's a real restriction.
46 2018-08-30 21:51:35 Re @anasalhajji’s question, recent experience suggests there may be enough rail cars, but the other commodities will fight for their space on the tracks.
47 2018-08-30 21:50:40 2 potential unknown commodities for an absolute game-changer on D. It’s a no-brainer.
48 2018-08-30 21:48:31 You know what happens when you have more "customers" than you can handle... you RAISE YOUR PRICES.

Online is a fucked marketplace for men.  Low barriers to entry for men = too much supply, too much competition. Men become commodities.  She is pointing right at that phenomenon.
49 2018-08-30 21:47:41 I would elaborate further on this. It wasn’t so much of a global recession either. it was specifically among emerging markets and some frontier markets (caused by the dollar and commodities). Developed economies were barely impacted.
50 2018-08-30 21:43:47 @BreakfastNews IMHO, there is no such thing as cryptocurrency.  There are several cryptic commodities that can be exchanged for other commodities.
You can't pay tax with them,  it's not legal tender

They seem to resemble tulips more than money
51 2018-08-30 21:42:17 Or take Hemsworth out and pay Pine the amount he's owed under the contract he already signed for the next movie. Chrises are very expensive commodities in Hollywood these days. It's hard to pay more than one at a time if you aren't Disney/Marvel.

53 2018-08-30 21:24:39 Peraí, então vc quer dizer que as commodities foi é que trouxe progresso  para o Nordeste, sozinhas, sem nenhuma interferência humana? A economia estava favorável, mas Lula usou para investir no SOCIAL que trouxe progresso. Não é demérito nenhum afirmar q o governo dele foi bom
54 2018-08-30 21:10:56 2 starters on the DL are replaced by proven commodities. Our nose was an undersized Freshman. Every single linemen added 15-20 pounds as well. More bodies too. Oh yeah, David Long didn’t play. Last year means nothing. I think the same way about you guys. Should be a great game!
55 2018-08-30 21:10:30 I already answered. Anything deviating from Christian ways will cause harm because it is wrong. Same sex unions are wrong, so they are wrong for kids - regardless of what rainbow religion preaches.
Kids aren't commodities, need mom & dad.
56 2018-08-30 21:07:16 Problem: 1- are there enough cars? 2- will that affect other commodities and shipments?
57 2018-08-30 20:58:36 You guess correctly. Unfortunately a lot of people seem to have the opinion that we farmers should work for nothing as some sort of charity to society. Supply managed commodities in Canada have a system that works for the consumers, farmers and processors and we will defend it.
58 2018-08-30 20:57:16 Unfortunately, I learned trading in the commodities market. I lost my ass every year with the exception of just a few. Gave it up a yr ago. Even w/all that exp I have learned a hell of a lot from you. Brought everything together for me. I can't thank you enough. Much respect! TY
59 2018-08-30 20:57:00 I've had that discussion with many financial planners over the years. 
Whenever I tell them I'm in commodities, they all get the same look on their face.
60 2018-08-30 20:55:45 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
61 2018-08-30 20:54:26 Point: it will take 30 years to spend a $1 billion if you spend $1 per second. It is the buying of commodities that really sets the economy. Not the expensive toys. And, there are more people who have less than a $1 billion than those who do, and need these commodities. Add it up
62 2018-08-30 20:47:33 As the trade war picks up , soybeans continue to be hammered. Futures prices for November delivery have fallen 23% from a peak of $1070 to $830, the lowest all year. Other commodities like corn and tree nuts are taking a hit.
63 2018-08-30 20:47:08 The new game of agrinopoly—lots of assets (commodities) for sale but fewer wealthy buyers.   Who wins?
64 2018-08-30 20:44:14 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”

65 2018-08-30 20:37:19 Tan asesinos y violadores como los paramilitares que popularizó su patrón Alvaro Uribe. Los cuales siguen agazapados disfrazados de políticos o empresarios, siendo paramilitares que negocian con coca, armas, oro y demás "commodities" criollos. Feliz dia Mafecita muac!
66 2018-08-30 20:36:19 What happened to suicide weekend?  How do you save a republic with this quantity of debt dependent on controlling the currency which buys energy and commodities in the international market?  Reserve currency status is not going to last much longer
67 2018-08-30 20:28:44 The Challenors wanted no ''respectful' debate. They milked the system and turned their children into dispensable commodities. The Green Party equally turned women into non-men. Its too late Caroline, not even Hercules herself could clean out the stench from your Party's Stables
68 2018-08-30 20:27:20 Y mira en términos reales la devaluación es menor que con los Kirchner, la pobreza todavía no supera el 30%. La diferencia es que Cristina(y más Néstor) contaban con los commodities por las nubes, bonanza que no tiene este gobiermo
69 2018-08-30 20:23:34 i had the same problem with private emails,   but commodities sorted out the politics
70 2018-08-30 20:23:18 Sort of a flawed argument logically. Get what you are saying but the typically % of picks that work out is under 50%. Just because recent success shouldn’t over value picks over known commodities.
71 2018-08-30 20:21:10 After elections it was gonna be hard for these smaller players to post profits anyway, wouldn't read too much into this. Wait for sustained losses 3-4 yrs down the line then speak of over exposure in real estate. Diversification into commodities etc should remedy situation.
72 2018-08-30 20:19:52 I think that is a misplaced statement.
Amazon is a retailer.

The bubbles you appear to refer to apply more to currencies and traded commodities etc.
73 2018-08-30 20:19:06 But Bri everyone knows commodities will be king and money flows will go into the safe haven UJ why not trade both
74 2018-08-30 20:12:04 It is completely racist, disgusting, & offensive. It shows exactly how we are seen as commodities. They can deny it all they like, but there it is.
75 2018-08-30 20:11:41 The price of fuel is at it's highest, 143 per litre, had nvr bn this high in any government b4 urs, price of goods and commodities in the market tripled nd in some cases quadripled. rate of dollar has nvr in any government b4 this get this high, wat well-being den r u talkin abt?

77 2018-08-30 20:05:23 "Sex is now a subject owned by corporations. It's used to sell commodities. It is itself a commodity. And the message is that if you don't have it, you're nobody." Bono, in 1996 ー U2 At The End Of The World ー Bill Flanagan
78 2018-08-30 20:05:03 3226: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
79 2018-08-30 19:58:51 I feel so bad when it comes to women to show their bodies as commodities.

88 2018-08-30 19:20:05 I agree with you and @stellacreasy . The big problem with contracts is that many have been sold on as financial commodities. I interpret many of them to be Blair's vanity projects. There are ways but my own opinion is that they should be subject to democratic accountability.
89 2018-08-30 19:19:51 Trump is creating a great buy opportunity by his tweets on tariffs and his shenanigans. Buy commodities, you people ; Buy everything you can!
90 2018-08-30 19:06:34 El tal programa contra la pobreza de Lula NO funcionó un coño. Al igual que Chávez, estaban inundados de plata por los precios de las commodities y quisieron resolver a realazos. Igual que en Venezuela, no era sostenible y ahora hay más pobres que cuando empezaron.
91 2018-08-30 19:06:16 Slavery was abolished in 1865 and Democrats still treat like commodities. Only now, as you said, they're used as votes.

94 2018-08-30 19:00:01 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
95 2018-08-30 18:59:17 Why on Earth would females want man sex dolls. A real male who is a decent human being is all that is required for any heterosexual woman.
Trouble is male groomed to treat sex and women as commodities are excluding themselves from the decent human beings category.
96 2018-08-30 18:58:03 All countries print money at will but the whole world use only USD to buy and sell commodities and energy. That's why the US don't suffer huge inflation.

If all dollars had remain within US borders, its value would have been zero long ago.
97 2018-08-30 18:52:51 The current account balance between Kenya and China is just unacceptable .We can't import commodities worth 390 billion against 9 billion export. 
Kenya to USA is relatively fair,
Kenya to UK is relatively fair. But what is this things with China my friend! #Kenyachinarelations
98 2018-08-30 18:51:37 it used to be that oil & other commodities were a large part of the 'strong-dollar' system which propped up the US dollar artificially; now it is a small part; they have several schemes;  I wish the dollar floated freely (&down) so as to encourage the domestic US economy;
99 2018-08-30 18:46:55 Honestly, what they should've done?  Make it so all commodities (stackable items) are simply listed as "X total available price Y" and buyers simply buy however many they want at that price. (1/2)

106 2018-08-30 18:27:52 Have to buy stock. Dumb not to. An equity run like this? Commodities will storm back once this inflated ride stops. I include crypto into the “commodity” space in my mind. Not a perfect fit, but I look at it as a hedge.
107 2018-08-30 18:25:46 Prison labor is also, I think, a manifestation of late-stage capitalism, wherein everything, even human beings, are reduced to commodities, the value of which depends solely on how much profit can be extracted from them. It's a heartless, soulless system.
108 2018-08-30 18:22:39 Now, get them to JOIN, pay their dues, and fight against "right to work" and move to repeal Taft-Hartley. I'm with you for the long term. 
Labor, according to Adam Smith is the "real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities."

222 2018-08-30 12:51:38 Bell and Dupree are worth more, JMO, than two true #1s in that they are given commodities. But also carry hefty price tags & have to be signed long term. More realistically it'd be Bell and a 2 or 3 for Mack. Which makes sense. If we got Mack, do you see if Watt can play inside?

So no overall change in purchasing power..

333 2018-08-30 03:14:09 Acho que o próximo presidente vai nadar de braçada, por pior que seja. Se for razoável, entra pra história. Commodities em recuperação = jorrando dinheiro por aqui.
334 2018-08-30 03:13:01 The gold market is now very short. 
CFTC data shows in the week to 21August, the non-commercial net long, the broadest measure of speculation, fell to just 5t, down from 23t the previous week, and the least long gold since 2001. #gold #shorts #Commodities
335 2018-08-30 03:07:03 nope. they're supporting their company and the sexist kpop industry as a whole that treats female idols such as laysha like commodities. but you sure seem pressed beloved
336 2018-08-30 03:02:27 True, you are not commodities.  If you're friendzoned frequently...well...maybe the issue lies...with you?  Also food for thought.
337 2018-08-30 02:53:37 Denayer, Guidetti & Roberts have the grand total of 1 Man City appearance between them. And we're not getting that standard of player from City any more. Now we're getting the guys they funnel through as commodities, like Arzani. City have no intention of ever playing him.

339 2018-08-30 02:49:06 they're creepy old men who view these poor girls as commodities. get over it.
340 2018-08-30 02:46:11 hidden cameras targeting women are a huge issue in korea, and it obviously stems from a much larger problem (sexism, viewing women & especially female idols as commodities, etc). laysha's treatment as a whole, even by their "fans", is disgusting
341 2018-08-30 02:41:44 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.

I get so excited reading W. D. Gann books on Commodities, that I can’t get through more than a handful of pages at a time.

352 2018-08-30 01:44:48 El precio del Oro al igual que el del Petróleo.  Esta sujeto al vai ven del mercado.  Alza y baja.  Rebotes y retrocesos.  Así que si mentira fresca dice que el Oro nunca baja de precio, lo dice por su ignorancia en el mercado de commodities.
353 2018-08-30 01:43:33 Fantastic numbers on a 50 year old tax case, among other commodities. This is “small.
354 2018-08-30 01:36:57 @realDonaldTrump ...Considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities. This is helpful not!  Nonethel….
355 2018-08-30 01:33:24 @Rotoworld_FB are White and Floyd known commodities??  Oakland would laugh at that offer as would anybody else!
356 2018-08-30 01:30:00 @RahulGandhi    Let me take your attention at the growing price of petrol, Diesel & essential commodities. Plz stop these tug of war. We the people r grinding. A very common question from a common Man. Save us or we have to sell our blood & kidney to feed our family.

359 2018-08-30 01:10:07 Lol- I don’t know how you have the patience with the yearlings and even more so breeding...such a long wait. Without SBSW, Sweet Lou and Captain might be hot commodities. Landscape completely changed.
360 2018-08-30 01:09:50 This is the height of entitled rudeness from consumers who think authors, etc are commodities or companies, not people. They BETTER learn some manners. 
361 2018-08-30 01:07:10 Conoces algo que funcione mejor que la "inversión, crecimiento y chorreo" en una economía tercer mundista productora de commodities?
362 2018-08-30 01:06:14 Both of you are wrong -hedge funds are a compensation scheme!  But seriously, I do have trouble calling them a standalone asset class as there are many assets and strategies employed within HFs (commodities, real estate, equities, bonds etc)
363 2018-08-30 01:01:36 What is one of the rarest commodities in the world?
364 2018-08-30 00:59:04 Siempre es especulación.. como el mercado bursatil las commodities o casi todo en en el mercado financiero
365 2018-08-30 00:59:00 And China giving North Korea Commodities while putting pressure on them? There must have been a misprint somewhere. You don't give gifts to someone you're putting negative and intense pressure upon.

373 2018-08-30 00:27:25 GAS prices.... Gas prices were higher under Obama and anyone with half a brain knows that the gas/oil market is manipulated by how many barrels they produce a day. The industry/commodities market want price to go up, they restrict the number of barrels produced. TAKE A HIKE #2.
374 2018-08-30 00:19:03 It’s funny how the gov’t is questioning the ‘sudden’ price increase of food commodities. 

It’s because of the TRAIN law, you incompetent sh*ts.

375 2018-08-30 00:12:14 I suspect the clubs organise the permits (just like orchestras do), & I doubt its very difficult because professional footballers aren’t ‘commodities’. Just a load of red tape.
376 2018-08-30 00:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
377 2018-08-30 00:05:34 From pg 3 of UN paper, "Food. In developing countries, the regime of exporting a narrow selection of commodities and raw materials and importing cheap basic food items has not worked for local communities." This sentence appears to contradict the World Food Programme mission and
