1 2018-09-21 23:59:58 Didn't Wallace's army get wiped out?
2 2018-09-21 23:59:53 Makes sense. I wonder if they handle crypto
3 2018-09-21 23:59:31 Thanks man
4 2018-09-21 23:59:28 But you fail to realize that I don’t give a shit. As long as it puts money in my pocket.
5 2018-09-21 23:59:21 Why do I get the feeling that this will not be satisfying, and I maybe lose some money/crypto? :(
6 2018-09-21 23:59:14 when is the vegas conference?
7 2018-09-21 23:58:41 The document you posted about SolidX ETF is very confusing and crypto community is not understanding perfect what is happening. Is the ETF delayed or not? Please answer @SEC_News @HesterPeirce.

Retweet so @SEC_News can read.

9 2018-09-21 23:57:36 Communist are exploring crypto for themselves. I´m curious when they put you into the gulag and start to beat the privatekey out of you for more equality

13 2018-09-21 23:56:35 I always vouched for him because I thought he understood crypto as a whole, not just a Bitcoin maximalist. Disappointed to see that
14 2018-09-21 23:56:25 $NANO currently at $2.60. ATH was $34.24. Instant transactions. Zero fees. Block lattice technology. Merchant adoption. Infinite scalability. 

We love the project and you should too! @nano
15 2018-09-21 23:56:10 Nano S hang when I access Digibyte in this device,
16 2018-09-21 23:56:05 Exactly! Would love to help with the narrative. Just imagine side characters influenced by big crypto crusaders like @officialmcafee @brockpierce @justinsuntron @among popping up throughout the story and maybe the story could be driven by finding out who the real Satoshi is lol

18 2018-09-23 23:59:59 That's the size of it. They are also busy sponging up the blue wave, saying there is really no base enthusiasm or reason to vote D this cycle. But it's a centrist smear to think they're crypto Trumpers
19 2018-09-23 23:59:47 2~3%動いたので上がった下がったになるんだから、値動きに調教されてる感半端ない。
今日も1日マイペースで頑張りましょう

24 2018-09-23 23:57:54 そもそも考えてみればメールだってウェブだって、もはや暗号化されてなければ使いものにならないわけで、crypto currencyだけ暗号って付いてるのが不思議。まあ、証券をSecurityっていうのもそういう流れなのかもしれませんが、グローバルにもそろそろ別の言葉を考えている人がいそうな気がします。

36 2018-09-22 23:59:53 As someone who lives in the U.K. And has done this for years, I advise you to ignore your accountants and understand there's no way of them finding any of your crypto or trades until your cash it out.

44 2018-09-22 23:56:11 ナウゼリン（ドンペリドン）と整腸剤はミヤBMなどですか？
確かに漢方薬で良くなる方もいますが、症状が続くようなら別の病院も受診してみて下さいね
45 2018-09-22 23:55:40 Thank you for somebody with some profile in crypto saying this.
