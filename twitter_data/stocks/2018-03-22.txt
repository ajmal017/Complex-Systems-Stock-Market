Futures are tanking.

Trump's tariffs are imposed on a whim. He likely doesn't even understand that they constitute a tax on consumers.

China is embedded in the world's supply chain, even when the finished product bears a german or US name.

40 2018-03-22 23:54:09 Not sure why they need a donation if it is such a good partnership.  

"hey, I have a great partnership; can you give me some money so I can tell everyone how great the partnership is?  Maybe let results speak for themselves.  This is how penny stocks operate.  Always a new line.
41 2018-03-22 23:53:59 US stocks fell on Thursday, with indices dropping broadly and volatility spiking as the Trump administration’s plans to announce new trade restraints against China renewed fears about a potential trade war that could dent economic growth.
42 2018-03-22 23:53:30 Well if ur 65 and invested heavily in stocks, you earned 30% the past year. Maybe you should have only lived off of 10% and stashed the extra 20% as cash so when the market dips, you don't sink.
43 2018-03-22 23:53:28 Market drops, investors buy up cheaper stocks...stocks rise, they sell...repeat.

The wolves always have dinner.
44 2018-03-22 23:53:04 Crypto and regular stocks convo
45 2018-03-22 23:52:23 The Dow Down almost 900 Points. A good time to see which Stocks are holding up.  Some of My favs—$BKNG—only down 2.1%. $PANW—Down 1.9%.  $RHT—Down 2.8%.  $ADBE—Down 2.8%.   $EA—Down 2.4%
46 2018-03-22 23:52:01 JPY Foreign Investments in Japanese Stocks diumumkan : -1,153.2B sebelumnya : -432.5B
47 2018-03-22 23:51:46 I think a lot of tech stocks that started in January and early February are just consolidating or pulling back slightly but April to July they will invite and move up 18-28% from their current prices before another consolidation in the Fall.
48 2018-03-22 23:51:45 Sea lions don’t “snack” on fish, they eat them to survive. If humans didn’t overfish (and waste vast amounts) then fish stocks wouldn’t be protected. Try reducing fishing quotas for human consumption before culling wildlife.
49 2018-03-22 23:51:13 Not netfix...hubby bought other stocks today that dropped ...not Netflix lol
50 2018-03-22 23:50:37 Kpoopies are so stupid. They don’t understand the difference between profit and stocks lmaoooo.
51 2018-03-22 23:50:06 Trump possibly ignites trade war with China and stocks plummet as a result.  One must ask, did his associates sell stocks leading up to Trump’s actions? Follow the money. #ConspiracyTheory
52 2018-03-22 23:50:05 This is a misleading headline.  Yes, stocks are down since 1/1/18, but we're still at near record-high levels.  Since the end of 2016, the market is way up, despite what this headline is intended to suggest.  My portfolio looks strong.
53 2018-03-22 23:49:43 In another universe. Stocks plumeted. Get out.

58 2018-03-22 23:46:30 Today: stocks down 700 pts - Another fired Nat’l Sec Advisor, lead atty quits and playmate says @realDonaldTrump offered cash after sex.  This is why we fight.  AMERICA is better that THIS! #FightLikeHell
59 2018-03-22 23:46:28 Stocks p2: Odds for up into May-Jul fall. At best a range? Violation of Feb 9 low would trigger sizably lower objectives.
60 2018-03-22 23:45:57 @option_snipper Thanks for all the input.  I know you only follow a few stocks.  What’s your thought on $CMG.  It was green today despite bad market.  Thanks.

63 2018-03-22 23:44:35 Trump is pretty much of a political idiot. His protectionist policies are going to hit Middle America in the pocketbook and business that sell to China are going to take a hit.  Why do you think relevant stocks are dropping? "Trump's China"

67 2018-03-22 23:43:17 Not much of an investor.. my stocks are like waaaaaaaay fucked. Oops #buyhigh #selllow #what
68 2018-03-22 23:42:58 This doesn't sound good, maybe if you own oil or defense stocks. I have seen this episode before, it's a rerun. Lots of people end up dying.
69 2018-03-22 23:42:26 Who do I blame for my stocks have plummeted again? Obama?
70 2018-03-22 23:42:18 Don’t have to be 100% long I am short 5 or 6 stocks usually granted 1/2 of those are the common stocks of pp coming due in the next couple months shorted  80,000 Bbd.b on close - it was added to index on close plus their new issue settles tomorrow
71 2018-03-22 23:42:11 Well on a happy note stocks of concrete and Potassium Iodide will go up.  "John Bolton"
72 2018-03-22 23:42:05 If this is true about the #tariffs #china just unleashed I expect some money will run to #crypto almost instantly.  #Stocks were already slammed today and it just got worse.
73 2018-03-22 23:41:28 Note to self. Call investor, suggest moving a bit more into stocks of companies that build fallout shelters. On second thought, sell all stocks and buy a 'build your own fallout shelter kit,' supplies will be running out fast.
74 2018-03-22 23:41:06 My stocks went down again today. Lowest point in 17 years. Scary Bolton now replaces McMaster. Winning yet? Are we? Trump people clueless.
75 2018-03-22 23:40:34 @WarrenBuffett , you must have upset Mr Presedent, he’s breathing FIRE man,you can’t upset him, he’s now CRUSHED The Worlds Stocks
76 2018-03-22 23:40:26 He has his billions they can only sue Facebook as a company his stock will take a hit. But I believe he is worth $70 billion outside his stocks. Correct me if I’m wrong.
77 2018-03-22 23:39:43 True, but not clear threat to the US. There are tons of domestic US buyers for USTs who would snap up anything China dumps; China is not impervious to the MTM hit to their remaining stocks of USTs; and not clear there are enough USD assets to move into to avoid RMB appreciation.
78 2018-03-22 23:39:42 Time to sell all stocks and buy a hole in the ground.
79 2018-03-22 23:39:37 This has long been priced into prices - stocks see things 6 month ahead normally.
80 2018-03-22 23:39:10 يوم الاحد 13  ان شاء الله
81 2018-03-22 23:39:08 Either way we got a LOT of time still before draft day. Opinions will change, things will happen, stocks will fall and rise. Who knows really.
82 2018-03-22 23:39:00 You’ll be needing that liver based lunch with extra iron to replenish the blood stocks in your alcohol system
83 2018-03-22 23:38:21 You just said nobody knows. So you're shorting undervalued stocks based on the fact that there COULD be a problem. Yikes.
84 2018-03-22 23:37:58 Diversification isn't just for stocks 
85 2018-03-22 23:37:55 "Crypto now is taking the place of the way stocks used to behave 10 years ago, 15 years ago." = the dumbest thing I read today.
86 2018-03-22 23:37:38 a bit of both for sure but i think the pot stocks were already down 5% across the board before the US markets deteriorated. Still, its one less uncertainty out of the way for now so individual company news should matter again :)
87 2018-03-22 23:37:17 Stocks falling, bonds rallying. It's like the old days when markets were functional.
88 2018-03-22 23:36:53 We should be demanding it now to give the fishing stocks a chance to replenish.
89 2018-03-22 23:36:40 Stocks p1: 700 points down in the Dow. I know I said I would be bullish until violation of Feb 9 low, but today's action seriously weekend overall cycle trend structure.
90 2018-03-22 23:36:17 Since last year Zuckerberg has gotten rid of $1 billion worth of stocks in Facebook. Does he know something we don’t?
91 2018-03-22 23:36:16 Also just contacted Vanguard and Fidelity Funds and instructed them to remove any Citibank stocks from my accounts.  No wonder their stock is tanking.
92 2018-03-22 23:36:14 I'm sure you know better than me, being a prof.  Seems like some of the metals stocks were already affected and world markets were down. So could easily be part of it.  Not sure why Trump thinks US is getting a raw deal, im sure its good for them they can leverage their size
93 2018-03-22 23:35:34 Yep. My stocks I bought in Obama's low era are looking good. And my 401k even better.
94 2018-03-22 23:35:16 and that Dems just helped pass a $700B / yr defense budget that dwarfs Bush's? there are "economic journalists" actually claiming stocks will drop 
95 2018-03-22 23:34:58 @DougKass will appointment of Bolton, alleged war monger, be a negative for stocks? Asking for a friend
96 2018-03-22 23:34:29 Bump stocks for every man woman and child in 'Murica! Sane, crazy, whatever!

99 2018-03-22 23:33:51 Girl do you even know how stocks work? I know you won't reply though cause you're a coward.
100 2018-03-22 23:33:50 Time to buy. Stocks, AR's & Ammunition.
101 2018-03-22 23:33:42 This week YouTube said that, starting in April, it will ban content that promotes the sale of guns and gun accessories like bump stocks, devices that make rifles fire more rapidly. Videos showing how to build and refashion guns to make them deadlier will also be removed.
102 2018-03-22 23:32:54 I have bought 2 single stocks. General Electric and Snapchat. Hope the do good. I also own Pacific Powerhouses also.
103 2018-03-22 23:32:38 Both stocks are way too extravagant, if you got it buy it..... I would raise more capital, we are not at the bottom.
104 2018-03-22 23:32:05 And down goes the stock market. If my stocks drop much further it will be penny stock.
105 2018-03-22 23:31:52 How far does the insider trading rabbit hole go? It's not stocks but cryptocurrencies after all !!!
106 2018-03-22 23:31:19 Hmm, trying to think of an economic angle on John Bolton so I can write a post about him.

"The effect of military aggression on GDP"

"Nuclear war as a risk factor for stocks"

"Internalizing the externalities of killing tens of thousands of innocent children"
107 2018-03-22 23:30:42 you should have learned a lot about your stocks today.  $study $COMPQ
108 2018-03-22 23:30:37 1.) easy for Bolton to have a hard on for more wars. It’s always someone else’s kids on the front lines. If this asshole wants war so much he can pick up a gun and go himself. 
2) TRUmps and Putin’s plan. Bankrupt the country from within w/ wars & stocks take dive on trade wars
109 2018-03-22 23:30:35 @RushRush2020 with c-45 passing second vote, pot stocks tanking today. Do you think it was a lot of big investors tanking the stocks on purpose to create a huge buying opportunity tomorrow?

119 2018-03-22 23:28:29 Time to get into more gold stocks.
120 2018-03-22 23:28:24 Do you think the trade war would affect stocks not in the US or China though. Just overall market sentiment I'm assuming could affect them.
121 2018-03-22 23:28:23 That’ll do nothing for my stocks.
122 2018-03-22 23:28:23 @sneaker_stocks I appreciate it bro! Thanks for checking it out
123 2018-03-22 23:26:44 Stocks, 401K and Credit was omitted from our curriculum. Don’t omit it from your life. Any family that has generational wealth was informed of those 3 things.
124 2018-03-22 23:26:18 What the heck happened to my stocks today?
125 2018-03-22 23:26:03 The trade war has commenced, my friends. Stocks are falling.
126 2018-03-22 23:25:58 Its definitely the tariffs. The stock market is not high school and doesnt engage in hazing. When the president is about to do something that will hurt the econony the stocks will react as such
127 2018-03-22 23:25:44 Short everything but defense stocks and iodine pills.
128 2018-03-22 23:25:40 Is war on the horizon. Should I sell my stocks
129 2018-03-22 23:25:39 Did anyone tell @realDonaldTrump that the Apprentice show is over and the shit show he's doing is driving down the stocks and making the world unsafer with dangerous chicken and egg game?
130 2018-03-22 23:24:48 It's not all bad news for diversified investors. If there's a trade war then no more rate hikes.

135 2018-03-22 23:23:43 you're apparently not invested in Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman or any stocks benefiting from the $700B / yr defense budget Dems just helped Trump pass
136 2018-03-22 23:23:28 Wow. Lot's happened while I was in my golf tournament today.  Just updated mkt stuff. Big down day for stocks. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES IN PLACE. Locking down the risk for now. Enjoy the ride everyone!

139 2018-03-22 23:21:58 Personally, with the wave of China trade war looming, it is hard to see signals even with low beta stocks like pot. I guess that helped not one bit

140 2018-03-22 23:21:48 The new policy, announced Thursday, prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines
141 2018-03-22 23:21:06 The leak of this is why stocks were down @CNBC
142 2018-03-22 23:20:49 Way to go dumbass @realDonaldTrump have you seen the stocks?!
143 2018-03-22 23:20:00 GOOD for people who dump China stocks before his announcement, Dow plummets, then they buy in when they're low. #INSIDERTRADING #LOCKHIMUP
144 2018-03-22 23:19:48 What are the rest of your specs? You might be better off settling for a 1060 if you aren’t willing for jesus to allow you to be the .00001% who can grab one at MSRP the literal second it stocks
145 2018-03-22 23:19:39 So if you were to sacrifice one for the other it makes sense to sacrifice the tiny industry in order to massively boost all others.
This notion that fish stocks will replenish faster outside the EU is laughable. 
PS how many fisheries meetings did Nigel skip out on?
146 2018-03-22 23:19:25 No one with a brain or integrity wants to work for you. They are dropping like flies. So if you only hire the best and they've all quit or been fired, who is left? Let's talk the dive in stocks. Once again, ALL YOUR FAULT.

149 2018-03-22 23:18:33 War!!! Go Halliburton stocks!!!  Maybe he'll call back us retirees back for WWIII.  Question is who did we invade.
150 2018-03-22 23:18:31 I know, but all my stocks are still in bullish set ups and held up well overall today so I’m not panicking out yet
151 2018-03-22 23:18:03 @Fxhedgers As a retaliatory measure, if Chinese authorities have sold US government bonds, US stocks will be devastatingly affected.
152 2018-03-22 23:17:48 Trump criminal enterprise coming apart at the seams and where are the republicans!? Well- Paul Ryan is trading stocks based on insider information.
153 2018-03-22 23:17:35 Go bag stocks up sharply in after-hours trading.
154 2018-03-22 23:17:12 Has anyone checked John Bolton's stocks in arms stocks?  You can bet he and Trump are all for getting the States into more wars so they can make more money.

156 2018-03-22 23:16:50 Stocks or baseball cards?
157 2018-03-22 23:16:36 AR15s are not part of a well regulated militia and neither are bump stocks
158 2018-03-22 23:16:26 @realDonaldTrump @maddow @JoeNBC Figured out why u r doing what u r doing. Stocks will tank,your family will buy in low and then u will make a statement about something and markets will rise and voila!! U make a pile of money.
159 2018-03-22 23:15:52 By looking at big stocks like MSFT , JPm, i am more inclined towards retest of 2/5 low . it is too early to tell as i am just now waiting for march month end for ES (2639/41)
160 2018-03-22 23:15:47 Oil stocks historically pricey relative to oil.
161 2018-03-22 23:14:55 Stocks dropped again today. #MAGA   Please resign.
162 2018-03-22 23:14:25 I did the same. The stock market is so slow and penny stocks are suicide
163 2018-03-22 23:14:12 1 Forgetting that once again Sarah told us McMaster wasn’t going anywhere, today is one of the worst days in Trump’s reign of worstbdays. Not withstanding a near record fall in stocks,Trump has picked a man, John who never saw a war he didn’t like Bolton for Nat’l Sec Advisor.
164 2018-03-22 23:13:22 On the bright side, the company that makes Iodine tablets should see their stocks go through the roof. Bolton is a huge mistake.
165 2018-03-22 23:12:53 I’m just saying savvy investors know that when the market dips, it’s a good time to buy. When it’s up, stocks are priced too high.
166 2018-03-22 23:12:50 #ASX200 trading 84 pts lower at 5853.20.

168 2018-03-22 23:12:26 @canabis thinking of putting cash in the cannabis stocks
169 2018-03-22 23:12:10 We are just moving from a 'technology' economy to a 'real economy'....in stocks at least.....I have no problem with that....
170 2018-03-22 23:11:34 Well defense contractor stocks will take a jump tomorrow
171 2018-03-22 23:10:17 Just started buying stocks, started in crypto first, so traditional stocks just don't feel as sexy now
172 2018-03-22 23:10:12 at least Trumps idiocy with tariffs gave everyone a nice discount on defense industry stocks right when John Bolton gets picked for NSA #shortgame #bombs #weareallgonnadie
173 2018-03-22 23:10:12 @McDonalds My Szechuan Sauce stocks are running out. Can you sell this sauce in big bottles please?
174 2018-03-22 23:09:42 Could pot stocks go down somehow tomorrow?! Lol i wouldnt be surprised sometimes
175 2018-03-22 23:09:39 Maybe 3-6% drop in steel stocks?
176 2018-03-22 23:09:38 I'm all for security measures. I've been a teacher for 30 years. Arming teachers will solve nothing. Paid security (not volunteers as some states such as AL propose), full ban on semi auto rifles (especially those that can be disassembled) & bump stocks would help too.
177 2018-03-22 23:09:25 You're so right Denise! I never listen to those "Cry Wolf" half-Trumpers! I'm always with him rainor shine..Stocks upor
He's my President& I'm his AmericanAMEN..Thank you GOD
178 2018-03-22 23:09:16 Black sea wheat FOB K8 > U8... Doesnt sound high stocks. Basis are are usually better in K than U for far east régions ?
179 2018-03-22 23:08:53 Well, I don't know about that... But I am surprised that someone and their buddies buying a bunch of US steel and exporter house stocks right before announcing self making a steel tariff and initiating a trade war based on export imbalance has not been questioned as illegal.
180 2018-03-22 23:08:41 Totally agree, some users don’t know what they are wishing for!
181 2018-03-22 23:08:02 Trump is manufacturing chaos,stocks were down 700 points again. SEC should look into if any of trump’s friends are shorting the market and certain stocks and are getting inside info. National security Adviser HR McMaster John Bolton @cnn @msnbc @nytimes @washingtonpost @cbsnews
182 2018-03-22 23:07:58 black. Cooler
183 2018-03-22 23:07:41 Couldn’t figure out why Stocks  panic cuz of tariff.  Don’t tell me they’re siding with Cheating China??!! 
184 2018-03-22 23:07:03 Shorters just grossly miscalculated Canadian weed stocks today  ouch
185 2018-03-22 23:06:15 This is the largest part of why stocks fell today! Not the tariffs!!
186 2018-03-22 23:05:26 My explanation is poor:
What I mean is 
Private companies aren’t in the market
Capitalization is the sum of corporations/ companies stocks that are sold to others 

SM, JYP and YG are public companies where there are shareholders (they buy sticks and own a part of that company)
187 2018-03-22 23:05:09 Jobs are way up, unemployment is lower for Minorities than it ever has... Stocks are moving up nicely. Companys have come back.. I think what's happening, I would disagree with ya. Is it temporary, maybe. All I know is previous admistrations actions killed us. We're doing better
188 2018-03-22 23:04:11 It's pretty difficult to spend stocks, or gold, but those have value based on supply and demand. I think some cryptocurrencies will become viable, regularly used currency, but that isn't necessary for them to have value.
189 2018-03-22 23:03:55 Buy defense stocks. 
190 2018-03-22 23:03:31 Stocks dropped again today. #MAGA   Please resign.
191 2018-03-22 23:02:48 @equitybroker_dk you’re an incredible moron and/or U have stocks in defense companies.  How about your family members go to war first.
192 2018-03-22 23:02:39 Isn’t the same true for stocks?
193 2018-03-22 23:02:10 Cause you need to be able to sell your stocks to people of the outside. To sell your stocks, as a private company you are close to the market, they can’t touch you. If bighit opens to the market they would be able to sell some of those stocks.
194 2018-03-22 23:02:05 And everyone is wondering why stocks took >700 point loss today. #TCOT #CONSERVATIVES
195 2018-03-22 23:01:57 Bomb shelter stocks set to soar in Friday’s trading

202 2018-03-22 22:58:49 Bill C-45 passed the 2nd reading, should be a decent catalyst for the stocks tmrrw and going forward there should be some more to get things trending up consistently until the 3rd reading approaches
203 2018-03-22 22:58:06 I love how certain people bad mouth cannabis and go off about how it'll not pass then delete their tweets after it does. But defend their stocks no matter what. Idiot's
204 2018-03-22 22:57:41 By “more” we assume you mean dead American soldiers and mushroom clouds. War stocks are about to explode. Btw how’s Iraq working out for you? #thoughtsandprayers
205 2018-03-22 22:57:30 A lot of negativity in response to this post... I'm looking forward to both these and the 385s coming in, allowing a cascade of stocks to other lines. Introduction not without its challenges, of course, but will be worth the wait.
206 2018-03-22 22:57:02 Thanks @realDonaldTrump. On a day I had to sell stocks you cost me $500.

216 2018-03-22 22:55:23 Does CNN oppose a level playing field for American business and workers? Or does CNN have major investments in foreign stocks?

224 2018-03-22 22:52:00 Let it fall.  I don't even know anyone with stocks.  I'm not worried about the plutocrats
225 2018-03-22 22:52:00 Agreed, valuations on projects will increase and diffuse the ups and downs. Alts will also move independently and not mimic btc. Ppl finally starting to see the trend & will stop falling into fud, crypto investors need to view their coins as stocks and investments
226 2018-03-22 22:51:57 Talking stocks on twitter, one must assume everyone has an agenda.  Paid promoters are dangerous.  The biggest indication that someone is a paid promoter is if they regularly go on the offensive everytime someone points out risks and refuse to acknowledge any themselves.
227 2018-03-22 22:51:47 You don’t care about these kids until you address Arma Lite Rifles and bump stocks.  I won’t say assault rifles because that offends the assholes that use them.
228 2018-03-22 22:51:25 Liberals....smh...
229 2018-03-22 22:51:21 And  drive down the stocks. And you say you are smart?
230 2018-03-22 22:51:14 @realDonaldTrump Hi Mr Trump, I would like to say " hi Mr. President" BUT, I have a real problem what you are doing to our United States of America! Since you have been elected, What have you accomplished? besides, pissing off the American people and the world? Our stocks are bad
231 2018-03-22 22:51:14 Markets killed all my stocks breakouts today.. today could have been a huge day for me instead I’m all red.. here’s to praying for a bounce tomorrow.. markets have fallen almost every day for 2 weeks straight.. even bear markets have green days..

WTF
248 2018-03-22 22:45:04 Facebook is about to be Myspace. Stocks are plunging and the one sided censorship is killing them. They have doubled down on it now and it will end them. Goodbye Facebook. We never were friend.
#KarmaBitch
249 2018-03-22 22:45:00 Haha well there are many other stocks I'd rather see go to 0 than MSFT, buy buy buy if you have cash or tax refund!
250 2018-03-22 22:44:55 BH literally earned only 100m sales and invest in one group while SM has 300+M sales and has been investing in actors, models, comedians, MCs, dramas, k variety shows , idols group and they've been buying massive amounts of stocks from major company.
251 2018-03-22 22:44:54 Además la sequía de este año te va a empujar a liquidar stocks que tengas de otras campañas ya sea para pagar las cuentas o porque la molienda sale mas fuerte a demandar para mantener las fabricas andando.
252 2018-03-22 22:44:51 I also wouldn't be surprised if these tariffs were planned so far in advance that Trump's family, friends, and financial backers purchased PUTS on steel stocks at dirt cheap prices.

260 2018-03-22 22:41:27 Plummeting stocks, $1.3 trillion added to the deficit, an uptick in domestic terrorism & now a war mongerer as head of natsec.  Man, can things get any worse? Like, wtf?! The state of the union is no bueno! 
261 2018-03-22 22:41:18 Actually its the general promotion of guns. Yes bump stocks are included but that is already under their terms of service that were already in place. Maybe you should read something other than the headlines
262 2018-03-22 22:41:07 Seem like everyone and their momma is either making wigs, doing makeup, buying bitcoin, or trading penny stocks
263 2018-03-22 22:41:02 #45 2nd reading passed. congrats to whoever bought the dip today. Weed stocks should all gap up a bit following the market sentiment.
264 2018-03-22 22:40:43 Oh no! 2.5% “plunge” after going up roughly 4000 points since his election!!! 

I thought you people believe that the stock market has no effect on the average American since rich people own all the stocks? Shouldn’t you be cheering?
265 2018-03-22 22:40:15 .@realdonaldtrump U have no idea what U R doing! Get the hell out, resign, quit. U R doing the very thing Putin wants U to do, ruining America. Stocks are down over 700+ points. Good plan by Putin, eh. Choose a weak, broke, sinner blackmail him to ruin the U.S. U R nothing!

270 2018-03-22 22:39:47 Thank you for your reply. The product continues to evolve, & I love the daily videos by Jim, and the cameo by you & Jeff. Regarding fundamentals, would love to learn more about how to analyze P/E such as in growth stocks vs consumer discretionary, PEG ratio, calculating FWD P/E
271 2018-03-22 22:39:04 I understand that. Wondering if presently the bond yields are manipulated lower than they would otherwise be, so that there is no mass exodus from stocks to bonds, thus preventing the anticipated rapid selloff.
272 2018-03-22 22:38:46 Nah, @realDonaldTrump and his comrades sold off all their pertinent stocks yesterday. 
Probably gonna repurchase when it hits their low estimate.  
He's literally making the stock market rise & fall to make them more $$$.

276 2018-03-22 22:37:11 When #stocks go down, #MSM 'comforts us' by saying that only the rich are affected. But if you're a retiree, and your income's from an IRA, every drop is real money lost, & quality of life diminished.

279 2018-03-22 22:36:38 Gun forums were screeching about bump stocks for YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEARS prior to Las Vegas, but nobody did a thing because the people who were in favor of gun control almost always default to broad strokes, non-specific stuff that's much less palatable to anyone who doesn't...
280 2018-03-22 22:36:18 The only issue with shorts is they expect these stocks to be valued on current fundamentals, when they are being valued on future growth. Not saying that is a good thing, but the market can stay irrational for a long time...  I read articles on the grizzle to keep in check
281 2018-03-22 22:35:50 Let's talk about the elephant in the room lets talk cannabis stocks @DREGLO Edibles LLC I'm the CEO/Founder. What's your acknowledgement?
282 2018-03-22 22:35:45 They are trying everything to get rid of this dude. This Trade War with China thing looks fun (If you don't own stocks)
283 2018-03-22 22:35:26 Stocks plunge and Bolton will be Trump's NSA.  Two god awful things in one day and I'm sure I missed a few.

288 2018-03-22 22:34:50 I think the problem comes from different objectives. You are looking at it from the investor pov, and buybacks are good. Some people are looking at it from society's pov, in which case the answer is not clear. There are some people who believe buybacks are manipulating stocks!!
289 2018-03-22 22:34:29 $VIX at 23 and change. Close to the high of the day. PUT CALL @ 1.18. Both help the cause for a possible bounce tomorrow. I'm hoping for one so I can raise cash and or move money from my weaker stocks.
290 2018-03-22 22:33:57 John Bolton is going to be National Security Adviser?

Time to buy some defense stocks...
291 2018-03-22 22:33:57 I’m not sure Crypto is mature enough yet not to take a severe downturn if stocks plummet
292 2018-03-22 22:33:55 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
293 2018-03-22 22:33:32 Me: Bolton as NSA. *Worried*
Wife: Time to buy defense stocks *cynic*
294 2018-03-22 22:33:22 Bolton??    Time to move your money  into defense industry stocks.
295 2018-03-22 22:32:53 I guess stocks will go up tomorrow
296 2018-03-22 22:32:40 Sorry, Iran.

304 2018-03-22 22:29:32 Today I had the chance to buy cheaper stocks as shown by the Dow Jones, Nasdaq (more my case) and the S&P 500 drops.

The importance of maintaining a cash amount is that it gives you the ability to buy when people go crazy. #ThursdayThoughts
305 2018-03-22 22:29:27 Please just one valid reason why you know for sure it's a scam.  Besides your 30years of penny stocks .  What about the press releases.
306 2018-03-22 22:28:59 Raise the age limit to 21 3-7 day waiting period Ban semi automatic guns of war Ban bump stocks Background checks for all types of sales. #NeverAgain
307 2018-03-22 22:28:44 I agree that one does not need bump stocks. They costly mimic automatic weapons. Those should be banned.
308 2018-03-22 22:28:03 Scenario: Bill C45 passes and MJ stocks continue to tumble.. can you explain why?
309 2018-03-22 22:27:53 You don't need to spend more money, just outlaw assault rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks. Make sure every gun purchaser has gone through a background check and implement mandatory liability insurance to be carried by gun owners.

311 2018-03-22 22:27:37 Tying themselves in knots to avoid doing the one thing that needs to be done. Ban all weapons capable of rapid fire and bump stocks that make it possible.
312 2018-03-22 22:27:35 Just a few growth issues with 5-week-plus pattern setups. This is more a function of the mkt's prior strength than the current weakness #stocks

319 2018-03-22 22:25:08 Stocks were pulverised and industrial commodities sank on the announcement of US tariff barriers aimed at China. China’s response was swift and uncharacteristically blunt, and investors rushed for safety, driving bonds and gold higher. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
320 2018-03-22 22:24:48 @cvpayne after the market drop today, I’m getting ready to dive in for some bottom feeding. Can you recommend any stocks?
321 2018-03-22 22:24:34 When trump is gone so many people will be stricken with a sudden case of depression not having someone to find endless vitriol in. Ill definitely need to buy into pharma stocks. Sales of antidepressants are gonna go through the roof!

342 2018-03-22 22:22:39 You all know shorting the market or specific stocks can also make huge amounts of money. Someone should really investigate if anyone made a ton of money shorting the market and see if there's a connection with this guy. Bet you there is...

344 2018-03-22 22:22:22 Im sorry to hear that but I think you are not the only one. I’m under water 3.8% actually I thought I was going to be worse my individual stocks just hold their support but not looking good.
345 2018-03-22 22:21:27 Lets also not forget that stocks are super overvalued due to 8 years of printing money, giving it to banks, and letting them invest it in the markets.
346 2018-03-22 22:21:17 It was only 2.93% right? less than 3 pennies per dollar and a great deal of that was from stocks of banks after they increased the interest.
We are still at or above the Jan 2018 market volume.
347 2018-03-22 22:20:57 In total agreement, but we have to be realistic in what is attainable. Universal background checks, banning of accessories like bump stocks, and banning of high capacity mags are attainable. I'm not sure much more is, at least at this time.
348 2018-03-22 22:20:38 Hopefully they don't influence us. But as long as we get 3 stocks I'm good.

351 2018-03-22 22:18:45 Stocks DOWN 700+. Great job!  Great decision.
352 2018-03-22 22:18:30 I refuse to post that one gif of the guy's shocked face while sitting in a theater, but I will admit, that was me after seeing the Dow dropped 700 today. Couldn't check my stocks all day. Time to get the dry powder ready!
353 2018-03-22 22:17:35 Met with my retirement planning people today. Looks like if I continue to invest in a variety of stocks and bonds, and assuming social security stays solvent, I’ll be able to retire comfortably.

357 2018-03-22 22:14:25 Do you support life or reasonable gun control?  If you support life, then ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large magazines, raise age to purchase, background checks for ALL purchases.  It's not rocket science!
358 2018-03-22 22:14:16 Took me 2 years to figure out how to sell my stocks 
359 2018-03-22 22:13:24 @realDonaldTrump Great news, but where’s the Executive Order banning bump stocks and other items that can convert a weapon to an automatic weapon? You promised to do that.
360 2018-03-22 22:13:00 Doesn’t seem like too much to ask.  Also, no conceal carry reciprocity, no AR-15s, no bump stocks, no loop holes, extensive background checks.
361 2018-03-22 22:12:24 I guess it was just the stocks I own
362 2018-03-22 22:12:14 What company is this? 
363 2018-03-22 22:11:24 But stocks bear almost no relationship to the real economy. They're increasingly tied to CEO & Stockholder speculative earnings from booming stock buy-backs made with free, fiat money and currently the predominant stock market activity
364 2018-03-22 22:11:07 Stocks have been trading in a range of 2K , once they get around 23,300 to 23,500 they’ll tick up again to 25K plus and the cycle will continue ..

366 2018-03-22 22:10:41 Forget about stocks for a second. Look at the Dollar bearing in mind that roughly 70 percent of the stock market is owned and controlled by foreign investors.
367 2018-03-22 22:10:40 I need to be strapped in stocks and have rotten food pelted at me while screaming “I’m a fucking idiot” to try and atone, because that’s what my Christian upbringing tells me to do. 

and my wisdom now tells me it won’t fix what I’ve done

Not least dwindling fish stocks, due to overfishing. Also a lack of investment in our fleet and relinquishing of quotas! The EU is our main market, tariffs would be disastrous to the industry!
370 2018-03-22 22:09:17 Stocks like China’s cheating??!! Go figure! 
371 2018-03-22 22:09:05 Same as for any asset. What is the use of stocks? Is anybody buying stuff for stocks? Maybe somebody accepts it as payment?

382 2018-03-22 22:04:48 WOW!

If it goes down 700 tomorrow I will start buying stocks.

We will soon get the mother of dead cat bounces.

479 2018-03-22 22:02:08 Stocks Just Tumbled to a 6-Week Low. Here’s Whyhttp://time.com/money/5211734/stocks-volatility-correction-today/
480 2018-03-22 22:01:26 Mr #Trump is a  ruthless gambler sending the stocks in the abyss worldwide.Tolerating such a dotard as #President of the USA only shows how downrotten the once proud US Republican Party has become.Let’s ve a very attentive look at the Trump’s family business these days. #tariffs
481 2018-03-22 22:01:13 Folks, i am still not ready for call options for stocks... That means i am just waiting right now.
482 2018-03-22 22:01:13 Exactly! He’s now only speaking out bc there is huge public outrage over it, and their stocks just took a major hit.
483 2018-03-22 21:59:43 Fox gaining 2 stocks and more time during that wobble!
484 2018-03-22 21:57:37 I don't even want to check my stocks.
485 2018-03-22 21:57:34 Yes I agree Growler. But then you are one of those investors that knows what you're doing. The market is more like a casino these days  However, investors in those stocks will get educated and be future investors in high quality stocks.  The same happened with Lithium as u know.
486 2018-03-22 21:56:58 I completely agree. The Technical guru's out there consistently hold stocks down using support and resistance as if they were unbreakable bonds. It's psychological, but irritating nonetheless.
487 2018-03-22 21:56:55 U.S. stocks fell sharply due to worries of a potential trade war after Trump introduce new tariffs targetting China
488 2018-03-22 21:56:15 My retirement gains are diminishing as stocks plunge.  Trump is even worse than our predictions.., the nightmare continues for the 99 % of us.
489 2018-03-22 21:56:04 Why do we care if stocks go up when our team is on the field and if stocks go down when the other team is on the field? Do we own any stock? Not likely-average net worth of bottom 95% of us would barely cover a new Lexus. But hey yeah points on the board baby points on the board!
490 2018-03-22 21:55:54 Mines is too but they doing too much so I use cash app plus I have a few stocks with them so why not use it lol
491 2018-03-22 21:55:46 Where stocks it ,the vegan low carb diet I am on needs this product
492 2018-03-22 21:55:46 44 advancers for $SPX today
128 stocks above their 50 day
#SPX closes -60bps below lower BB
2.11 close for $TRIN
$VIX up 30.68%, in backwardation

Alrighty then.
493 2018-03-22 21:55:40 Whether Canadian weed stocks gap up or gap down tomorrow depends on this group of political retards in Ottawa. #C45 #weedstock

497 2018-03-22 21:55:07 Guess which three #sectors have outperformed over the past month? #RealEstate, #Energy, and #Utilities! The iSectors Post-MPT Growth strategy is overweighted in these sectors. Stocks are moving to late-cycle sectors! #PostMPT
498 2018-03-22 21:55:06 Stocks yes, cryptos no
499 2018-03-22 21:54:35 Theory: Putin orders Trump to lower taxes for the rich to stimulate the market. Now that the stocks are soaring grab the market by the pussy and Putin orders tariffs on China. Putin’s goal is to cause turmoil in other countries and exercise his power over our bitch POTUS.
500 2018-03-22 21:54:24 Wonder what stocks Wilbur sold before this...
501 2018-03-22 21:54:24 With -724 plunge on #Dow today, signs of panic-like selling in #NYSE stocks Arms Index which is a volume-weighted measured index of market breadth used to gauge intensity of buying and selling (2/2)
502 2018-03-22 21:54:12 Well, should I put into a cash isa or stocks? (Is that what you meant by adult chat?)
503 2018-03-22 21:53:22 Bump stocks are not banned from sale, not yet. They are banned from NRA ranges, but are very much available for sale.

506 2018-03-22 21:52:16 ...cases like bump stocks, etc.

But they're talking ALL firearm assembly videos. Like, restricting access to shit like "HOW TO CHANGE CHOKE TUBES FOR SKEET SHOOTING" or swapping out barrels, etc. isn't going to do anything but further the idea that gun rights are under siege...
507 2018-03-22 21:51:48 Wonder if and when $uav global uav technologies will get listed on the tsxv
508 2018-03-22 21:51:10 You shift from a low return environment to a high return environment one of two ways 1) fundamentals outpace expectations (hard for me to imagine at a cycle peak) or 2) by bonds and stocks getting cheaper (i.e. selling off). The latter will lower (not increase) 10 year returns.

513 2018-03-22 21:48:10 What kind of gun control laws did the Democrats sneak into the bill?  I personally feel betrayed by anything other than better background checks, no bump stocks and raising the age to 21.  Anything other than that I can promise you will be a big issue with the 63 million voters.
514 2018-03-22 21:48:09 Citigroup sets gun rules for its retail clients- bank will prohibit clients from selling guns to people under 21 years old & Business customers must also run background checks for all firearm sales  and cease selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks-

523 2018-03-22 21:43:00 Someone teach me how to do stocks
524 2018-03-22 21:42:38 US stocks suffer heavy losses as the #Trump administration's plans to impose #tariffs on Chinese imports fuel fresh concerns about the possibility of a global #TradeWar #TrumpTariffs #WallStreet
525 2018-03-22 21:41:44 *Slashes right through 5 bamboo stocks.*
526 2018-03-22 21:41:16 So is this when the companies with all of that tax money step in and buy their stocks! I bet they have been waiting for a sell off because stock prices have been so high!
527 2018-03-22 21:41:13 "the move sent stocks diving on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about two percent in the face of the announcement and ratcheted up Trump's confrontational stance with trading partners"
528 2018-03-22 21:40:58 I'm just laughing @ how this person doesn't know that stock market and selling stocks has nothing to do with sales and profit. She wanted to be relevant and intelligent for a day, poor thing
529 2018-03-22 21:40:52 Ignorant, toothless, trump supporters don’t have stocks !

532 2018-03-22 21:39:07 @realDonaldTrump your killing our economy, stocks keep falling and my 401 K is suffering.
533 2018-03-22 21:38:28 US stocks slumped on Thursday as Prd  Trump’s move to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports drove fears about impact on the global economy, fueling the biggest % declines in Wall Street’s three major indexes since they entered correction territory six weeks ago.
534 2018-03-22 21:38:17 Stocks Plunge Rapidly Upon House Passing Omnibus Bill.
535 2018-03-22 21:37:39 Seven years ago, had you guessed that US small stocks would match their long-term inflation-adjusted average thru 2017, you'd have been off (too low) by 1.4% a year. GMO's forecast was off by 12.6% a year!

...and they're still publishing forecasts!?!
536 2018-03-22 21:37:33 You should come live in my small town. Growing up it couldn't have been better. I came back 11 years ago to care for mom. Mom passed in June and I'm too poor to move out of this gang infested town...mom has over $200,000 in stocks missing and I get threatened for investigating it
537 2018-03-22 21:37:20 "Trump to Sign Executive Order Changing Dow Jones Constituent Stocks in Interest of National Security: 'Our country needs to measure its worth in the Netflix's, the Shake Shack's, and the Bio stock your cousin keeps talking up.'" #DowJones
538 2018-03-22 21:36:46 Recent example: Yahoo Finance -> back to Stocks. No ads, native app performance (Yahoo Finance clearly built on some janky cross-platform framework), gets raw Yahoo Finance headlines, integrates with other Apple products. 

Even though Yahoo Finance is way more "designed"

541 2018-03-22 21:35:31 It’s just videos that either demo or link to sites that sell weapons or accessories that are banned in the US such as bump stocks. Don’t buy into the fake news.
542 2018-03-22 21:35:19 Mr. Speaker one more time, no bump stocks, no large capacity magazines, no military style assault rifles and you guys stop taking money from the NRA. Now read this tweet and if you care about our children please re-tweet this. We can have the second amendment and safe schools.

551 2018-03-22 21:32:57 Yikes!  I had not noticed that drop.  I sold my KENV on the tick-up after suspension.

Then again quite a few mining stocks taking a hit at the moment..  The Dow plunge today means I might stay under the covers tomorrow morning lol.
552 2018-03-22 21:32:46 #cash and #bonds starting to compete with #stocks with yields going up - this could also be contributing factor to #selloff
553 2018-03-22 21:32:03 Stocks today lost all of the value they’ve made in 2018. The market is negative year to date. This is a big deal the crash is coming quickly. #marketcrash
554 2018-03-22 21:32:03 "Nice hair, sell stocks"
555 2018-03-22 21:32:00 This isn't just about teenage deaths. Common Sense Gun Safety legislation keeps EVERYONE safer. ALL THE TIME. Eliminating open-carry and stand-your-ground laws would be big, as would restoring the "assault weapons" ban that worked great for ten years. Ban bump-stocks.
556 2018-03-22 21:31:43 going back to where my stocks were around thanksgiving. i'm broke!
557 2018-03-22 21:31:25 Yeah, I've been on the market for a short while, but the amount of far right thinking that goes into purchase and sale of stocks and the subsequent rise and fall of them is sometimes obscene. Jobs are strong? Brace yourself for a loss.
558 2018-03-22 21:31:19 And as a result, Stocks tumbled down, gee thanks for depleting my 401k you p.o.s
559 2018-03-22 21:30:49 #OMG #Trump is using his position to sabotaging the #StockMarket ...when it tumbles and hits bottom (starting a huge recession) he's going to do a mass buy out of stocks to own more companies. He's going to buy the #USA to be like #Putin : corrupt absolute leader of #America .
560 2018-03-22 21:30:09 Year-to-date, the Dow has moved an average of 0.93% daily, 12 bps higher than the S&P 500’s average daily move of 0.81%. Got to love those high-beta stocks 
561 2018-03-22 21:30:01 Terrible confession ... I have closed my bear in $TSLA Apr calls ...so now flat one of the most cynically over valued stocks
562 2018-03-22 21:29:59 Unfortunately fish stocks are declining due to over fishing, pollution due to plastic etc. Fishing is not sustainable at present level, there need to be further cutback in fishing for the fish stock to recover. The trawlers should be paid to catch the plastic in the sea instead.
563 2018-03-22 21:29:32 As they shift from paying in to market to drawing down, I wonder if the recersal@of flies will be noticed. Given concentration of stock ownership in hands of few wealthy who let it ride might not be noticed. (Say, 20% of stocks owned outside the 10%?)
564 2018-03-22 21:29:18 Anyone on here uses ScotiaBanks ITrade platform to trade stocks?
565 2018-03-22 21:29:14 How’s the stocks doing?
566 2018-03-22 21:29:14 20x zero is still zero in 1984. This line "no place else for the sheeple to go" is some real hardcore analysis from the oh look the stocks going up analysts.
567 2018-03-22 21:28:41 Well done @realDonaldTrump! Way to rev-up the economy!! (#Stocks fell 2.5%, as the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and #China sent Wall Street shuddering) #OUTSTANDING

570 2018-03-22 21:27:46 @realDonaldTrump announced trade sanctions against China, & now "Stocks are plunging, sending the #DowJones industrials down 700 points, as investors fear that trade tensions will spike between the US and China."
Way to #MAGA! Let's watch prices skyrocket at #Walmart now

576 2018-03-22 21:25:44 @SenBobCasey @SenToomey do not take away any rights that the 2nd amendment gives us. Stronger background checks, no bump stocks, no large clips   Don’t need the AR’s or AK’s either
577 2018-03-22 21:25:40 Jp - stocks don’t typically top more than 1 y prior to recession (1970s inflation shock exception).  Boa- 50 Percent of total bull mkt returns during last 24 m.  Most during final few months.  Historically doesn’t pay to be bearish stocks unless you think recession likely
578 2018-03-22 21:25:34 Remember the good old days when stocks weren't manipulated...oh wait that still happens.

688 2018-03-22 21:24:38 Stocks Dive on Trade War Fears After China Sanctions - U.S. News & World Report
689 2018-03-22 21:24:30 It's not just the Dow, the Russel 3000 index of largest stocks from all US markets is worth about $30 Trillion.  1% of that is $300 Billion.  The markets in total probably lost around $600 Billion today.  Maybe more.
690 2018-03-22 21:24:21 It's a great oppunity to buy stocks. MAGA
691 2018-03-22 21:24:01 Germany stocks lower at close of trade; #DAX down 1.70%. U.K. stocks lower at close of trade; $FTSE100 down 1.14%
692 2018-03-22 21:23:58 And as soon as all his buddies have made new fortunes by selling off affected stocks ala Icahn, he'll decide to lift all the tariffs and do something else that we THINK is stupid. These people are looting the goddamned country and we just sit here and watch.
693 2018-03-22 21:23:04 I wouldn't say there's no reason for stocks to crumble--nosebleed valuations and a cyclical growth slowdown combined with very high corporate leverage ratios. Reasonable to expect stocks could crack almost any time for psych reasons. Just feels too early though, & too news-driven
694 2018-03-22 21:23:03 France stocks lower at close of trade; #CAC 40 down 1.38%. Spain stocks lower at close of trade; #IBEX 35 down 1.49%.
695 2018-03-22 21:22:49 If you could buy the same shirt today as yesterday but pay 3% less, you'd be happy not sad. You should view stocks the same way. A chance to buy great companies at better prices
696 2018-03-22 21:22:37 Remember: Bump stocks and assault rifles did not claim responsibility for the Vegas shooting.  ISIS did.
697 2018-03-22 21:22:08 Esas stocks.
698 2018-03-22 21:22:03 Not today...lol, definitely fell over 720 points 5th worst day for stocks of all times because of his disastrous tariff announcement. He also hold 1st, 2nd and 9th place for worst drops in history. Is that what you call winning??? Sad!
699 2018-03-22 21:19:58 One can hope. However, last time stocks tanked crypto tanked along 
700 2018-03-22 21:19:29 Bump stocks were used in 1 mass shooting, but lets ban it. Majority of shooters are over the age of 21, but lets ban under 21. Universal checks are already required, but lets make a new law, no significant data has proven 20-30 round mags are more dangerous. This is so dumb.
701 2018-03-22 21:18:53 Stocks on sale!!  Time to buy!!
702 2018-03-22 21:17:45 not really, big tech stocks and poorly ran companies who have been in trouble for a while suffered and fell. but thats it, makes sense since ppl were eating up tech stock like crack rocks in chicago southsiders on a 100 degree day.
703 2018-03-22 21:17:36 I forgot to mention "tomorrow's Cattle on Feed Report March 23rd." Those who wish to stand aside till after the report-then cancel your order & wait. Bad day for the stock market-stay long SPXS. #Commodities #Agriculture #Stocks #Cattle #farming #ETF
704 2018-03-22 21:17:33 Compassion died by the cold dark hands of corporate tyranny. The strangling vines of stocks and cents chocked the lovers neck.
#WorldPoetryDay
705 2018-03-22 21:17:32 World stocks tumble: US -2.5%; Europe -1.6%. Trade war jitters came to the fore again as Trump's protectionist policies look less limited than previously thought. Increases risk of retaliation & a back and forth. Could eventually impact economy & corporate profits. Stay tuned.
706 2018-03-22 21:17:15 Proposed federal gun bills: Concealed carry nationwide reciprocity; repeal DC gun laws; arm school teachers.

Proposed DC gun bills:
Ban bump stocks; prohibit extended ammunition clips; penalize gun trafficking; remove guns from domestic violence abusers w/protective orders.
707 2018-03-22 21:16:54 The @hotcopper Love Hearts game of buying low on SI share issues & then having the stocks pumped , either by colluding with other love hearts or having posters do it for them, combined with failed M'ment pumping their stocks on social media is a blight on the @ASX @asicmedia
708 2018-03-22 21:16:51 Ahh look at that. Stocks seem to be on sale again.
709 2018-03-22 21:16:42 LOL.  NO waiting period.  NO banning ASSAULT rifles. No banning bump stocks.  What you MEANT to say was, at the request of the NRA, you'll do nothing.  Nothing at all.  Your changes won't save lives.  The blood is on your hands.  Enjoy hell.
710 2018-03-22 21:16:05 Bankers posing as morality leaders? That's just awkward! I support #2A but not everyone does and that's okay. #CITI is likely making money by buying Gun Stocks that will likely go up. This is a money grab!
711 2018-03-22 21:15:53 U.S. stocks plummet to worst day in six weeks after Trump tariffs - National -
712 2018-03-22 21:15:51 Your handle is biosleuth why arent you out raping pos bio stocks?
713 2018-03-22 21:15:49 Maybe if there was not so much effort in bringing down Trump people would actually focus on his accomplishments and the dow would be up.  Or if FB had not lost people’s trust stocks would not be dropping.
714 2018-03-22 21:15:07 #LauraIngraham Pls keep up the pressure on the 1.3 Trillion spending bill. I am writing to POTUS, McCarthy, others  to not pass this stupid bill. Now he has screwed up the stock market today with his stupid tariffs . Retirement is tough when  the Pres causes stocks  drop badly
715 2018-03-22 21:14:05 Stocks dive on trade war fears after China sanctions @NewsSyndicator
716 2018-03-22 21:13:17 Way to go, Trump! You've screwed so many, why not economy, stocks, farmers, Americans!
717 2018-03-22 21:13:07 I for one am damn sick & tired of fearing what's going to happen to the stocks in my retirement fund because of the knee jerk decisions made by an insane Orange Madman in the the WH. It's 5:00, I'm going to drink now 
718 2018-03-22 21:12:58 There is probably a limited amount of stocks but does it command a £5K price tag.. it’s certainly one way to alienate your customers
719 2018-03-22 21:12:56 I wonder how many folks in the swamp, got a heads up and traded their stocks accordingly?
720 2018-03-22 21:12:44 Market Close: MBS +13bps; DOW -724.42; NASDAQ -178.61; S&P 500 -68.24; 10yr Treasury 2.83%; Stocks close at days lows due to concerns on new tariffs on China, leading to possible global trade war.  MBS close just above 25 DMA, well off earlier highs.  Not a very convincing move.
721 2018-03-22 21:12:30 oh no my stocks !!! - my impersonation of guy who has a lot of money tied up in the stocks market today
722 2018-03-22 21:12:28 your timing would've been fine, cuz stocks were coming off the lows lol
723 2018-03-22 21:12:24 And there go the stocks again #StockMarket
724 2018-03-22 21:12:23 Because he knows he's in deep shit and needs to get his story straight. Plus he had to see a few hundred million in stocks first.
725 2018-03-22 21:12:01 And stocks plunged.  Wharton wants their degree back.
726 2018-03-22 21:12:00 Well we do know   he is so happy he had insider trading  & sold his nasty stocks -  oh my gosh   the  money-power hungry  are  way too far gone.  They love themselves  FIRST.
727 2018-03-22 21:11:39 #?look at our children walking out of school on the news , why china children are globalist stocks, international trade at level s unheard of our our children play video games, not good, need to take back China, reciprocal, fair trade.
728 2018-03-22 21:11:32 @NinjaTrader  unable to set up NSE stocks and indices EOD charts. Pl guide.
729 2018-03-22 21:10:53 I’m still only 30 years old. Have been investing any spare cash I have since 18 into stocks and shares which have returned well. Patience always gets you good returns. That’s why I’m willing to give my crypto investments at least 10 years before I would think about giving up.
730 2018-03-22 21:09:39 In general you want to sell premium! A lot of people myself included use options buying for a leveraged quick move! Treat it like you work stocks just got to be careful with % allocated per trade and have stop losses in place!
731 2018-03-22 21:09:35 Doing really great if one is in a position of controling the stock market, by setting policy, and then  trading one's own stocks accordingly.
732 2018-03-22 21:09:35 We still have some prepacked fancy dress costumes for children going for a bargain.  Only £5.00 each while stocks last.
733 2018-03-22 21:09:23 Crocs> stocks duh
734 2018-03-22 21:09:14 Sadly, I'm sure Drumpf and his cronies have shorted a crap load of stocks ahead of the announcements.
735 2018-03-22 21:08:53 Stocks fall due to a lack of buying not just due to shorting. But if it helps to blame, by all mean ...
736 2018-03-22 21:08:29 @TheFive there's a tragic budget deal the stocks are in the tank and you guys are on to a silly feud between an old man who is notorious for acting inappropriately around WOMEN by touching them, grabbing them? Silly show I'm turning the dial
737 2018-03-22 21:08:29 Makes me laugh when I see financial bods braying about avoiding IHT by purchasing AIM stocks. AIM stocks are the most volatile of the lot.
Yes you might avoid IHT .. but it could be that you’ve no money left to pay it with!
Lol  wealth management my arse.
738 2018-03-22 21:07:57 welp, there go my stocks
739 2018-03-22 21:07:55 Somthing about massive data breach.
Facebook stocks completely did a nose dive due to it
740 2018-03-22 21:07:55 According to Gallup, just over half of Americans own stocks at all. What’s more, the richest 10 percent of Americans own 80 percent of all stock shares. The bottom 80 percent of earners own just 8 percent. #TaxScam #TaxCutsForStockBuybacks #TaxCutsForCorp
741 2018-03-22 21:07:39 Whatever happened to that Carl Icahn story where he sold steel stocks prior to the steel tariffs?
742 2018-03-22 21:07:27 We expect the price of Crude oil is traded side away ( $59 to $66) till early of summer time. Energy stocks are still under pressure. $DQ, $ECA, $BTE, $SWN and $WLL.
743 2018-03-22 21:07:00 @jbenish22 happy birthday my guy. hope you had a fabulous day cashing stocks and what not #oakmont
744 2018-03-22 21:06:53 Considering by the End of the Obama Admin unemployment was low, stocks up, and overall outlook was great you might actually be right.
745 2018-03-22 21:06:44 Oh, brother. Did you ask how he will bring the stocks back after they are tanking due to his sledgehammer approach to tariffs?!
746 2018-03-22 21:06:22 some people prefer to die taking painkillers than let a doctor fix things. the debt and unfair trade must be fixed, stocks will rebound soon
747 2018-03-22 21:05:51 However that doesn't matter does it? The point is bighit easily could've invested in shares of other companies and became shareholder. In case you didn't know anyone can buy stocks honey. And that's a way to make more money. Clearly they didn't invest in stocks as much?
748 2018-03-22 21:05:24 Food and Gold are the only stocks not taking much of a hit after Trump tariffs.

I predict 1350 gold by the end of the day tomorrow.

756 2018-03-22 21:04:54 Stocks also dropped at the start of this month as the administration got ready to put tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Those tariffs turned out to be looser than Wall Street first feared. Will that happen again?

780 2018-03-22 21:00:28 You buy stocks to get shares of a company honey and that's one way to generate income so yes please go educate yourself.
781 2018-03-22 21:00:07 According to Gallup, just over half of Americans own stocks at all. What’s more, the richest 10 percent of Americans own 80 percent of all stock shares. The bottom 80 percent of earners own just 8 percent. #TaxScam #TaxCutsForStockBuybacks #TaxCutsForCorp
782 2018-03-22 21:00:02 Good to hear that Matt. Yes, I'm dripfeeding into market. I was too early into cash last year so if I don't buy now I never will. Are you buying yet or waiting? I'm looking at unloved stocks offering them a home with covered yield.
783 2018-03-22 20:59:38 Honey they definitely can sell stocks although it might not be as easy. But that's not even the point Bc anyone can BUY stocks  and clearly bighit hasn't invested in any so that's that.
784 2018-03-22 20:59:30 @kling_barbara I hope the n.y.Stock exchange is looking at large blocks of stocks that were shorted last and this week.The names such as Ichan  who 2 days beforeTrump said he was putting tariffs on steel Ichan  sold all his steel stock and of course denied he knew about tariffs,
785 2018-03-22 20:59:28 The “peak” was back in Jan. and anyone saying otherwise is selling you something.  

That being said, sometime later 2018 will be a great time to be bullish and buy.  Hopefully impeachment is the trail marker.  “Everything rises and falls on leadership”!  #stocks $SPX #DowJones

793 2018-03-22 20:56:30 I have been to farms. It depends on the farmer and the farm. I know a farmer who employed 80 people. Could have fired 75 and bought a harvester. He loses money every year to keep those people employed (has stocks that do well). Farmings tough.

Workers should have better housing

So what does that make a broke ass man who requests the goods with absolutely nothing to offer? A BUM.

903 2018-03-22 20:54:06 #Skeptical?  I think it's you who sadly doesn't understand what this headline means.  People are selling off their stock, reducing the value of their various stocks, in a hurry.   Trade wars aren't good for economies.  Are you saying the S&P 500 is basically useless or fake news?
904 2018-03-22 20:53:37 I continue to be out of commission this week but I have a few moments to share some thoughts..... Many stocks hover over their 200 DMA and are likely to meet it tomorrow or by Monday. Some will break below it. We are not their yet.
905 2018-03-22 20:53:18 Most ordinary people do not gamble on the stock market. Stocks going up do not affect the buying power of the majority of Americans.

908 2018-03-22 20:51:58 The stocks drop like a rock and no budget in sight. What is  Congress up to besides ripping off the people.
909 2018-03-22 20:51:53 Its not spam, its relating Bitcoin to those in the crypto sector when its up and down which I try to update daily just like I do Gold and the Metals sector and Stocks related to market dips and highs like Facebook today, If you're trying to please everybody it wont ever happen.
910 2018-03-22 20:50:55 If you're a stock investor - now is the time to buy the heavy machinery mfg companies.
When Trump's steel tariffs kick in these stocks are gonna be off the hook. 
Buy low, sell high.
911 2018-03-22 20:50:31 And stocks dropped, but that's ok because you already bought all of your steel from China!
912 2018-03-22 20:50:19 What we are saying now is that your announcement to start a trade war will cost jobs & drastically increase the cost of many items. AND there was a huge drop in the stock market today because of you. Eveyone who works in stocks or anything to do with economics knows you're wrong!
913 2018-03-22 20:50:10 What about STOCKS crashing??

916 2018-03-22 20:48:34 The stock market is going to put in a major top-as least for the time being. Stay long SPXS and than add-on on a breakk-out above recent highs, or sell calls! This fall election and the trade policies of our present admistration could turn it down! #Stocks #Commodities #ETF

919 2018-03-22 20:47:46 I have learned that with stocks especially #Biotech if you continue to hold them after they’ve gone up a lot you kind of forget about them until they’ve gone down a lot
920 2018-03-22 20:47:06 Will the man who takes credit when stocks rise accept responsibility for the 724 point drop today? 
Doubt it!
921 2018-03-22 20:46:25 The top five stocks that gained today were $PCG, $VTR, $EIX, $EQIX, and $SBAC.
922 2018-03-22 20:46:24 If 2% concerns you, maybe a savings account instead of stocks?!
923 2018-03-22 20:46:20 Most Trump supporters don’t own stocks or even have retirement plans, so they don’t understand how the stock market affects them.
924 2018-03-22 20:45:40 Better look at your REAL media. They don't want to hurt your feelings. Stocks down 700. Now what?
925 2018-03-22 20:45:31 The top five most active stocks today were $BAC, $FB, $GE, $MU, and $AMD.
926 2018-03-22 20:44:54 It and some of the other food stocks are starting to look interesting

928 2018-03-22 20:44:31 Holy smokes! Dow Jones taking a bad hit today.. bad losses in stocks. 
929 2018-03-22 20:43:59 The wealthiest people on this earth have most of their wealth tied to stocks and bonds which is why neither asset class will go to 0 imo.
930 2018-03-22 20:43:24 Many American blue chip stocks down over 5%

Trump will take everyone down with him, Turnbull & Murdoch included

931 2018-03-22 20:43:10 Great effort by Doncaster @cefonline lads to get them to me. Turns out no where stocks these on the shelf and have to order them in. @taylor_606 did some running about and got me 5 from different branches. First class service 
932 2018-03-22 20:43:09 Stocks down 723  maga my ass
933 2018-03-22 20:43:04 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
934 2018-03-22 20:42:38 Missed poet's day so I shall make amends:

$TWTR is all a flitter
Cuz last week's tariff bull stocks are in the $hitter. 

Margin monkey brokers are bitter and they long for the good old days at Dean Witter.

FD: had not so hot verbal on SAT, best I can do.
935 2018-03-22 20:42:32 I'm just waiting for the Chinese to respond and see what comes out of Europe tonight. No reason to gamble. I will just put in crazy prices for stocks I like tomorrow.
936 2018-03-22 20:42:29 U wiped $-billions from the value of stocks and the 401-ks of millions of Americans
937 2018-03-22 20:42:03 Dow Slumps 724 Points as Tariff Tantrum Sinks Stocks!!!! Winning.
938 2018-03-22 20:41:33 Like most of the healthcare stocks the volume profile had a very poor structure that allowed that drop to come so quickly, the good thing is that if it can base off today's lows, the structure is just as bad on the way back up.
939 2018-03-22 20:41:19 I’m going to bet we haven’t hit bottom on stocks yet. This is a good time to remember how many great years we’ve just had...
940 2018-03-22 20:41:06 Take a look at the stocks today Sara Hucksterby Sanders.
941 2018-03-22 20:40:57 The front end of the curve was at nearly a 10 year high on Monday and then rates rally as stocks roll over. Trade wars are an excuse to sell. If this happened a few months, maybe there wouldn’t be a market impact
942 2018-03-22 20:40:35 Trade war casualties, as chosen by Mr. Market today. Yes, oddly, those are steel + aluminum stocks leading the plunge.
Pls explain, Mr. President.

Thurs. losses:

US Steel $X -11.0%
Alcoa $AA -6.3
Caterpillar $CAT -5.7
Boeing $BA -5.1
$MMM -4.7

945 2018-03-22 20:40:23 So Trump and GOP give a HUGE tax break to business.

Businesses buy back their stock.
Trump imposes tariffs
Stocks dive 
How long  before they turn on Donnie??
946 2018-03-22 20:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
947 2018-03-22 20:40:17 Highest deficit in history. Feds raise rates for the 4th time - watch your mortgage and credit card rates climb. Ass kissing Putin.  And now plunging stocks on fear of trade wars with China. Thanks trump. All this winning...... #ImpeachNow
948 2018-03-22 20:38:57 Trade war between US and China?  Stocks tumble?  Just following Putin’s orders. Don’t blame Trump. He can’t help it.

951 2018-03-22 20:37:30 Stocks down 724 points today
952 2018-03-22 20:37:08 $TVIX Adding TVIX. Do u really think people just can't wait to buy into stocks tomorrow?  Buyers are on hold, except for TVIX.
953 2018-03-22 20:37:00 DOW JONES PLUMMETS: U.S. stocks sold off sharply Thursday, with Dow tumbling more than 700 points amid growing fears of a trade fight between the U.S. and its trading partners after President Trump said he will impose billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports @cate_long
954 2018-03-22 20:36:30 penny for your stocks?
955 2018-03-22 20:36:27 It wasn't for you, 
you could search about stocks w/o amusing shiT tho
956 2018-03-22 20:36:20 Invest in worms. Buy worm stocks! They’re your future, after all.
957 2018-03-22 20:35:45 Just got a breaking news alert saying “Stocks fell sharply, with the S.&P. 500 down 2.5%....” but y’know Yay Trump...
958 2018-03-22 20:35:37 GE stocks will go up !!
959 2018-03-22 20:35:27 On days like today.....visit that list of stocks you wish you had and be thankful that they are more affordable!!
960 2018-03-22 20:35:18 Let’s talk about stocks, Baby! Yeahhhh! 
961 2018-03-22 20:35:03 (2/2)

So, even if $SPX doesn't puke any harder, and they DO recoup ~ $50B in deficit...

The first year just came straight out of your pension funds as an up-front payment.

#investment #stocks #economy #ausbiz
962 2018-03-22 20:34:52 Pulled all my money out of stocks (apart from individual issues) when the first talk of tariffs hit...I think it was the right call.
963 2018-03-22 20:34:51 (1/2)

Definition of irony-

$SPX market cap at 2017-12-29 was ~ $24T

Announcing trade war to recoup $50B deficit sold the market off 2.53% today

Expressed in dollar terms that's an immediate destruction of $60.72B in value

964 2018-03-22 20:34:48 Hilton do you not appreciate that we need to have a cooperative approach to fish stocks in our waters? Do you not appreciate that fish populations move around? Freedom of movement is a necessity for fish
965 2018-03-22 20:34:45 It's interesting, that on a day when stocks, once again, fall dramatically because of vaguely defined fears, how quickly the meme that the public is actually not easily influenced and manipulated has spread.
966 2018-03-22 20:34:33 Lmao *stocks
967 2018-03-22 20:34:19 Stock Market drops more than 700 points today. Been dropping for days. So much for Trump being good for the economy & Stocks. Retail stores closing, rents rising more than past 2 years, interest rates rising, huge federal deficit & now new tariffs increasing prices to consumers!
968 2018-03-22 20:34:03 Let Trump & his economic team keep pushing protectionism & we'll find out how low stocks can go.
969 2018-03-22 20:33:58 Strength will appear on a down-day, weakness on an up-day. #learn #education #charts #technicalanalysis #wallstreet #stockmarket #market #stocks #stocktrading #trading #traders #daytrading
970 2018-03-22 20:33:36 We have Trump to thank for this .... all you people depending on stocks to boost your IRA - kiss it good bye
971 2018-03-22 20:33:33 No worries, it's just me and the other middle class "millionaires" taking some profits. Later we will be buying stocks "on sale".
972 2018-03-22 20:33:27 Wondering if POTUS can pardon his friends for 
insider trading ?

S&P 500 turns negative for 2018 as stocks tumble on trade fears 

#TheResistance
973 2018-03-22 20:33:18 Maybe. But we may deplete our entire stocks of haddock through dumping them underneath Westminster Bridge as a result.
974 2018-03-22 20:33:05 I think that if an investor really thinks they can pick an active manager that always reliably beats the indexes net of fees, then they would be better off directing their talent towards picking winning stocks and managing their own strategies for a living.
975 2018-03-22 20:32:54 The FED is being disingenuous by taking the stocks down and covertly buying bonds to keep the bond sentiment and yields in check....
976 2018-03-22 20:32:31 The establishment wants to take down social media. It’s the plan. That’s why Zuck sold stocks. He knows. They can’t control the narrative even though they try on SM so they will take it down! 
977 2018-03-22 20:31:53 please , your great "honor" is worth about what the stocks did  today...NOTHING.  worse than nothing. in fact your name will be worth  nothing you wont even be able to put your worthless name on a Motel 5... the knock off of a Motel 6
978 2018-03-22 20:31:42 #Breaking: Stocks fell sharply, with S.&P. 500 dwn 2.5%, as the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. & China sent Wall Street shuddering
979 2018-03-22 20:31:39 New longs in the name are shaky right now. Hate when headlines drive stocks of good comps
980 2018-03-22 20:31:02 Speaking of stocks...
981 2018-03-22 20:30:50 The 37% only cares about folding stocks!!! MAGA!!! 2A!!! Cold Dead Hands!!!
982 2018-03-22 20:30:44 Which stocks was POTUS' family short selling?
983 2018-03-22 20:30:34 Omg stocks do that!? EVERYBODY PANIC! Save the children!
984 2018-03-22 20:30:25 Wouldn't it be nice to know what stocks trumps are buying and selling before and after he makes these market tanking decisions? I'm sure it's all on the up and up though.
985 2018-03-22 20:30:06 Well actually, their slide was better than other tech stocks today. The Dow fell 2.9%, while FB fell 2.6%.
986 2018-03-22 20:30:02 Poverty is unnecessary! forex stocks investment
987 2018-03-22 20:29:50 Easy, build time machine and Invest in good stocks. Problem solved.
988 2018-03-22 20:29:45 I have no idea in short run but today did feel like stopfest across few products.  would say big picture think earnings decent and Fed while tightening still going moderate pace so don't see major reason for stocks to crumble
989 2018-03-22 20:29:33 The stocks are down because of Facebook data scam, no trust in the internet, FBI crimes against Trump, and the feds raising interest rates.
990 2018-03-22 20:29:06 shit now all my stocks are tumbled
991 2018-03-22 20:28:54 Now it's time for Large Caps.... the best and the strongest looking stocks will give the worst return...............
992 2018-03-22 20:28:32 " Stocks are plunging, sending the Dow Jones industrials down 700 points, as investors fear that trade tensions will spike between the U.S. and China.”

Thanks Donnie, you great deal maker you...
993 2018-03-22 20:28:25 Looks like the Chinese are selling all of their stocks to drive the DJIA down. (This is the next POTUS Tweet)
994 2018-03-22 20:28:14 I wonder how many of Trump's buddies sold stocks ahead of this trade war announcement...
995 2018-03-22 20:27:56 Gold is strong!! Stocks everywhere are overvalued. Sold 30% of crypto and stocks. As pull back is coming and flight to saftey. Cashed up and ready to buy back everything I sold.
QE cant help. Big winner will be crypto and BTC. When dust settles.
996 2018-03-22 20:27:38 Stocks impacted by trump. @TeamCavuto There, fixed it.
997 2018-03-22 20:27:02 Heading to Denver Friday evening, thought about celebrating not getting blown up in cattle, but then I realized the anti-wealth effect I'm feeling from stocks overrides any feeling of ease. No Fleming's ribeyes this time.

1000 2018-03-22 20:26:26 That's odd.  I thought the stocks available for purchase didn't include a vote in the way the company is run.  Your statement is a little misleading.
1001 2018-03-22 20:26:25 Economy, more money in pocket, bank n stocks.  The Wall !! Infrastructure, , agriculture, NASA.  Biggest for me backing of our Military.  And now trade agreements.

1005 2018-03-22 20:24:29 Stocks continue to trend up, or they break trend. Markets trade in familiar patterns, not according to valuation, news, or opinions. Trust the charts

1007 2018-03-22 20:24:14 wish trump didn't declare stocks illegal to get even with china and mexico but here we are
1008 2018-03-22 20:24:07 @realDonaldTrump now we are seeing the real tRump economic policies in action.  Stocks in the toilet and allies jumping to China for trade.  Good job Donny boy!!
1009 2018-03-22 20:23:50 We can talk trump talk real estate stocks and bonds....
1010 2018-03-22 20:23:43 Unfortunately the system is so rigged the 1% will always know to pull out of stocks we'll before the common investor does.  So they would still make ungodly amounts of money and commoners would see all their retirement and savings disappear.
1011 2018-03-22 20:23:35 Wow. Again someone falling in love with their stocks. Google Lakewood  hedge fund short on Canopy. Call it a hunch but they have done 100  times more research than u ever could. And have bet according 10,000 times more than anyone reading this tweet.
Invest accordingly.
1012 2018-03-22 20:23:12 Donald Trump inexplicably has a degree in economics. For most people, if they have taken ECO100, the one thing they remember is 'trade is good'. Are we saying he can't remember ONE thing? (see any of the 'stocks plunge on prospect of trade war') headlines below.
1013 2018-03-22 20:23:01 my stocks are dying and so am i
1014 2018-03-22 20:23:00 45 S&P 500 stocks in the green today.
1015 2018-03-22 20:22:49 Stocks down 724......Muellers coming....Does someone know where Trump is.....just askin'
1016 2018-03-22 20:22:40 so sorry does not help. send some dollars my stocks are down.
1017 2018-03-22 20:22:21 WATCH IT BURN! STOCKS TUMBLING WHILE I MAKE RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN! ALL HAIL PUTIN MY BUTT BUDDY! @potus I'm doing exactly as he wants. So great. And my lemmings still support me because they're too stupid to realize I'm not on their side. SAD!
1018 2018-03-22 20:22:09 It’s simple. If stocks go down, I buy bonds. Trouble with the Dow? Np, I take my business to the nasdaq. Short selling not going well? Buy long baby. When it comes to the money game, you have to know your #options #smart #trading
1019 2018-03-22 20:21:57 fuckin stupid administration giving biotech companies greater freedom yet starting a trade war with china makin my stocks go down what the motherfuck
1020 2018-03-22 20:21:51 The deteriorating global market technical backdrop since start of year has found its way to the US. The nasdaq on its own lead by increasingly fewer stocks was never going to hold it all together single handedly
1021 2018-03-22 20:21:33 The value of all US stocks is roughly $30T. Today, those stocks lost about 2.5% of their value, or $750B -> all so our so-called POTUS could distract us with an ill-conceived $50B worth of tariffs on Chinese stuff.

Let that sink in. $50B of dumb tariffs. $750B of lost value.
1022 2018-03-22 20:21:28 U.S. stocks sold off sharply Thursday, with the Dow tumbling more than 700 points amid growing fears of a trade fight between the U.S. and its trading partners after President Trump said he will impose billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports.
1023 2018-03-22 20:21:09 But Bump fire stocks are inaccurate and the speed varies. Full auto is much different.  Btw should we ban the mini 14? They can hold 30 rounds and it shoots .223 but the gun doesn't look all scary due to it having wood on it.
1024 2018-03-22 20:20:59 I listened to the law clerk and bought some stocks he recommended. Now I’m down $3K. Motherfucker
1025 2018-03-22 20:20:54 Raising age to buy guns, banning bump stocks and devices that increase speed of fire, three day waiting period to buy guns, 400 million for mental health programs, as well as a voluntary program in which they could arm staff at schools. No, you’re right. That’s nothing
1026 2018-03-22 20:20:53 Kind of weird Trump doesn't tweet about stocks anymore when there's so much activity in the market.
1027 2018-03-22 20:20:51 History shows: when stocks zig..commodities tend to zag.
Today the Dow Jones futures market was down an ugly 763 points.
1028 2018-03-22 20:20:42 Just like Icahn who dumped 30 million in stocks before the announcement. I would not be shocked to find out many Trump cronies are shorting companies who will be hurt by tariffs
1029 2018-03-22 20:20:39 Sell stocks now or is this the bottom?
1030 2018-03-22 20:20:31 @realDonaldTrump You really screwed up the markets with your China BS. Did you make sure your buds all shorted their stocks?

1036 2018-03-22 20:19:31 Dow finishes dismal day down more than 700 points as shaky markets are further rattled by fears of a U.S.-China trade war and by slumping tech stocks in wake of data privacy scandal
1037 2018-03-22 20:19:20 So I see!  Stocks going backwards.
1038 2018-03-22 20:18:54 Like making us the laughing stock of the world. Speaking of stocks- plummeted today! Not to mention acting like a school yard bully!
1039 2018-03-22 20:18:37 Dam Trump your killing me ...my dam job is slow ...mt business is slacking now my dam stocks are falling off .......WHAT PART OF ECONOMIC GROWTH DO YOU NOT UNDRSTAND ...DAM!!!!!
1040 2018-03-22 20:18:13 The company said it will prohibit corporate clients from selling bump  stocks and high-capacity magazines, as well as ban them from selling  guns to people under the age of 21 or to those who haven’t passed a  background check.

1046 2018-03-22 20:17:33 @CNBCClosingBell  The reason why those #Snead stocks  are cheap because they’re not growing as tech which are generating $$$ and not debt to ward off the #Amazons
1047 2018-03-22 20:17:29 Gravity in action the big accelerator further wrapped the financial fabric of the  market support to cause stocks downward.
1048 2018-03-22 20:17:19 The world has confidence in trump. If they didn't our economy and stocks would not be where they are. They would be low like the last guy

1054 2018-03-22 20:15:31 Check out Kimberly-Clarke. They were able to buy back stocks & layoff over 900. One of many companies doing the same
1055 2018-03-22 20:15:17 #TradeWar and tax cuts will be a boon for American manufacturers and workers. Dow Jones lost today because those companies overexposed to imports sold their own stocks to take profits.
1056 2018-03-22 20:15:17 Not at all the same. Portugal had 3 shit games but still advances. March madness Virginia plays terrible they are done and are laughing stocks forever
1057 2018-03-22 20:15:15 How many of Trump's friends coincidentally dumped related stocks in the past week?

1066 2018-03-22 20:13:34 Stocks will rebound.  It’ll just take some time and will be on the back of a Main Street driven growth in real income.  What we’re seeing is a return to volatility.  Something that’s been less frequent since, well, NAFTA.
1067 2018-03-22 20:13:33 GOOD!! US Stocks have been waaaaaaaaaaay overvalued for years now!!!
1068 2018-03-22 20:13:32 Could Trudeau actually take a sec and actually think about the stocks in Canada?
1069 2018-03-22 20:13:27 If you own airline stocks, the good news is that with exceptions of $AAL $SAVE and $ALGT they didn't fall as far as the Dow did today.
1070 2018-03-22 20:13:23 A week ago, I was mad at myself for not selling stocks a week earlier. The day, I’m glad I sold stocks last week.
1071 2018-03-22 20:13:18 Everyone keeping eyes on $FB... Let me laugh.. Mark Zuckerberg is a very pathetic human being and far from a man in my book. Seriously, the guy is pretty pathetic. And you don't play the news huh? People are funny. #Stocks
1072 2018-03-22 20:13:15 Stocks will bleed on the open. #nifty50 bearish
1073 2018-03-22 20:13:11 I laughed when I read your tweet because that was my first thought. When GW Bush was President and republicans caused the market to fall I kept thinking that there was a great sale on stocks, there was-I bought back then and will do it again. Great minds.
1074 2018-03-22 20:13:05 You guys are hilarious. “Stocks today went (up or down) due to investors being (cheered or spooked) by (thing that happened in the past 24-72 hours).” You have no idea why the market moves in the short term.
1075 2018-03-22 20:13:01 You mean the Florida that passed a law to arm teachers? That's progress in your book? No laws against bump-stocks in most states. No laws against AR-15 style weapons, or large capacity magazines. None of the loopholes for gun shows or peer-to-peer gun sales have been closed.
1076 2018-03-22 20:12:59 I dont get peoe long stocks with a braindead meglomaniac at the wheel
1077 2018-03-22 20:12:56 The only way you can "lose" stocks is when a bona fide purchaser buys them. The question would then be where the law allocates the risk. There's no such a thing as losing "Korean stocks". That's what "yangachis" can think of, but to the learned, it's simply not possible.
1078 2018-03-22 20:12:54 Bank stocks falling. Where are you putting your money? #btc
1079 2018-03-22 20:12:49 Yea look what you did to stocks and our 401k with your actions!
1080 2018-03-22 20:12:42 Is it also your honor that the stocks are crashing due to your tariffs on China?
1081 2018-03-22 20:12:41 Canadian stocks haven’t been doing well for the last 36 hours now and the least said about the #CAD on the #USD , the better! Not a happy investor right now. #TSX #NYSE #Stocks #investments #ETFs #Stockstowatch #MutualFunds #forex #CurrencyTrading
1082 2018-03-22 20:12:06 Working now and had only mobile for trading. Holding nothing now , no red in my swing trades. Tomorrow off, so will select probably 2 or 3 stocks and SPY. From what I can see EOG and some other shale plays held up well today. Watching 71.80 area for FSLR. Open to puts or calls.
1083 2018-03-22 20:11:59 Stocks fall... Dow Jones down over 720 points... Hurt by concerns over trade wars and social media scrutiny.
1084 2018-03-22 20:11:31 Just an FYI stocks plunged 700 points - good job NOT.
1085 2018-03-22 20:11:28 You can’t eat stocks! 
1086 2018-03-22 20:11:25 @AliVelshi not being an economist, I was curious how this trade war will impact commercial real estate and the Trump/orbit organizations. At 1 time, real estate was  investment option over stocks. Are these policies setting up 1 market over the other?
1087 2018-03-22 20:11:24 Lol people like bernie. Is it a surprise? What about the stocks?
1088 2018-03-22 20:11:15 Breaking: Trump stakes on China tariffs send stocks tumbling.
1089 2018-03-22 20:11:13 We need some positive news again.  Hard day.... stocks,lawyer, trade, and concern over spending bill.

1092 2018-03-22 20:10:35 The following items are the current proposals:
1. Ban bump stocks
2. Stricter background checks
3. Age limit increase to 21, not 30
4. Semi-automatic weapons ban
5. Arming teachers

So...
1. WTF are you referencing??
2. Sources please
1093 2018-03-22 20:10:30 @CNN @POTUS does as he promised and makes Stocks less expensive to buy . @DowJones drops over 700 points . Well done Donald .
1094 2018-03-22 20:10:20 Stocks fell off because everyone can see that the federal government will never rein in spending no matter which party is in charge. They will steal ever more from us & print more money until we collapse. Venezuela, here we come trying to emulate your successful path to doom
1095 2018-03-22 20:10:09 What's important, however, is to let those 100 individuals have the stock certificates if they want them. The law surely can enforce it. Neither the laws nor stocks were invented by the Koreans, and they are of such a long standing, no matter what the lottery ticket sellers say.
1096 2018-03-22 20:10:08 Did you see the market today?  No matter how good anyones earnings are the stocks would drop.  Once the smoke clears, you will be glad you had Micron $mu
1097 2018-03-22 20:09:52 Eventually companies will run out of money to buy back stocks.
1098 2018-03-22 20:09:51 @johnrobertsFox @FoxNews Are you kidding me right now. Stocks drop because of shakeup in Trumps legal team? The media is absolutely idiotic! Investors are nervous about possible trade wars, tech companies are under fire, etc. Idiots.
1099 2018-03-22 20:09:31 Trade wars spark concerns as markets trade lower. Steel stocks, industrials and "FANG" stocks all trade lower.
1100 2018-03-22 20:09:31 Nice!  But stocks are still overpriced
1101 2018-03-22 20:09:08 Stocks tumble in volatile trading amid fear of trade war http:// It appears that the average investor on wall street has an IQ of about 45. Just so you morons understand, there ain't gonna be a trade war!!
1102 2018-03-22 20:09:05 This trade war KILLING stocks man smh
1103 2018-03-22 20:08:31 Perspective!!

Yes, the stock market seemingly tanked again today. But get a grip. It’s still 3,289 points HIGHER than on this date in 2017!  

Stay awake.  Find some stocks you’ve always wanted and buy them. They’re probably on sale

1105 2018-03-22 20:08:29 Tariffs are good for stocks.

Stocks down 700+ points on tariff announcement.

Pick one. @realDonaldTrump
1106 2018-03-22 20:08:22 So wait?  Why do OUR stocks take a beating with these Tariffs?  I thought that it was designed to protect Americans?
1107 2018-03-22 20:08:20 Congradulations to @Steven1_994 for making 110k this morning shorting &

1108 2018-03-22 20:08:04 My grandsons Trust fund will be ruined. It's vested in American stocks! For my dying. Only thing i could leave my little man age 8. Damb Trump!
1109 2018-03-22 20:08:02 U.S stocks declines were board with nine of the 11 sectors in the S& P 500, and all 30 stocks suffering losses with Dow plunging 700 points  No need panic 
1110 2018-03-22 20:07:58 Down markets just mean that stocks are on SALE. Just have to look at them as an opportunity, not as a negative.
1111 2018-03-22 20:07:57 Donald Trump is making it look like not investing in stocks is actually good for your money 
1112 2018-03-22 20:07:51 Donald Trump: "Stocks have never been better"
Sean Hannity: "Donald Trump is winning on the Stock Market"

1117 2018-03-22 20:07:14 If you are long stocks...you probably don't follow Bear.Bear. Ignore me at your peril. Bull Markets don't act like this.  Ill say it again. Bull Markets don't act like this... YOU know what does...Bear Markets. This is Crash that will start a Recession.  $sPY $FB @JustinPulitzer
1118 2018-03-22 20:07:10 Certainly not a short term stint for me. Only for losers and if you load delisted stocks you will see why. Many don't come back
1119 2018-03-22 20:07:04 @Sarge986 Had to figure the Chinese would not respond. Letting us hang. I'm still bullish on Media and Entertainment. Defense stocks now more than ever.
1120 2018-03-22 20:07:03 There are like less than 100 individuals who own any significant amount of stocks, the rest are so-called "ants" who buy as if they buy lottery tickets. The sellers do not know what they're selling, nor are there regulation, etc. There's nothing there. 空. Maybe there's something
1121 2018-03-22 20:06:54 You know, I'm not entirely sure what state doesn't have background checks (nor what universal means in that context), bump stocks do need to be dealt with given it's a work around to more or less convert civilian weapons to fully automatic (sorta), but as for the rest
1122 2018-03-22 20:06:52 How in the hell didn't Trump see this free fall in stocks coming or, at least, have someone tell him that.. 

Dow Jones dropped 700 pts today. 

This man destroys everything he touches, literally . 

@jwheels74 have seen how far it dropped? Cray cray.
1123 2018-03-22 20:06:50 Is that why all the American steel stocks tanked today too?
1124 2018-03-22 20:06:49 Most of us do though. 2nd Amendment would be a much bigger ship to move. Simple gun regulation laws are not hard and don't require any changes to the Constitution. Constitution didn't address bump stocks, AR-15s, 100-roound magazines; we need to.
1125 2018-03-22 20:06:45 What a day for stocks. Damn.
1126 2018-03-22 20:06:36 Way to go you fucking loser. Stocks tank, AGAIN.
1127 2018-03-22 20:06:31 Here we go again!  T-rump does (or threatens) something, which drives the stock market down.  He and all his cronies buy up stocks cheap.  Then, he says something which drives stocks back up, and they sell off what they bought at phenomenal profit.  INSANE, but it works for them!
1128 2018-03-22 20:06:09 Investors flee stocks as new Trump tariffs fuel trade war fears.

1139 2018-03-22 20:04:30 If u invest, it would be wise to lighten up on tech/chip stocks until dust settles over how China responds. Add defense, retail, & banks stocks to portfolio: Raytheon, Macy's, Khols... 
#Alibaba might be a good play (Chinese version of Amazon)

1154 2018-03-22 20:02:32 If Trump was such a great businessman he would know how much the financial market hates volatility. He ran a private company not a public company. People are taking their profits and dumping stocks left and right because of the latest Trump headlines. #Chaos #Trump #DJI

"I play the market, not stocks"..."I rely on facts, not some BS players on Twitter..." 

I'm not talking about stocks or Twitter...I'm talking about the ignorant politicians in the Senate.
1159 2018-03-22 20:02:18 Just a reality check... If you got into the stock market when Trump started his presidency, you're still looking reaaaaal good...

1169 2018-03-22 20:01:27 Quit fucking with my stocks. That would be great.
1170 2018-03-22 20:01:24 U.S. stocks tumbled the most in six weeks on the threat of an escalating trade war with China. The Dow fell more than 700 points. -- Bloomberg
1171 2018-03-22 20:01:16 Today's action isn't terribly surprising, especially if you've been following along the last few weeks.  Weak breadth invariably leads to choppy or down mkts. Remember it's a market of stocks, not just a stock market. No momo, no reason to trade aggressively.
1172 2018-03-22 20:01:08 The stock market is taking a plunge today, apparently due to "trade war talk." That's just a reactionary knee-jerk to the 24/7 doom and gloom from #FakeNews.

Great time time buy stocks, patriots! #MAGA
1173 2018-03-22 20:01:07 Anyone notice @realDonaldTrump doesn't talk about the falling #StockMarket anynore, how much has it dropped, almost 3% just today.

1189 2018-03-22 19:59:36 Der heutige Kursrutsch ist allerdings nicht von so hohen Umsätzen begleitet wie die Tage im Februar; #wallstreet, #stocks, #trading
1190 2018-03-22 19:59:36 I am fairly certain by the end of the day Trump will have done something that will erase the sorry feeling you feel for the dude. If you own stocks it has already passed.
1191 2018-03-22 19:58:58 Trump tariff announcement had such a big impact in down in my stocks! Like a lot
1192 2018-03-22 19:58:51 Expiration Weeks are always so much fun..... #Stocks
1193 2018-03-22 19:58:48 Don. Where is your boastful blabber to accredit the stocks plunge to your amazing@leadership?
1194 2018-03-22 19:58:26 Disappointing & surprising lack of volatility among precious metals given the #stocks bloodbath. #Gold has been extremely muted during 2018. $GC -0.3%
1195 2018-03-22 19:58:10 Wow I hate stocks and the stock market
1196 2018-03-22 19:58:10 But good dividend stocks and hold for a long time? That’s pretty good advice.
1197 2018-03-22 19:57:57 stocks 
1198 2018-03-22 19:57:51 My overall portfolio is down 5%... ya a few stocks might be down more or less...  if you want large gains on individual stocks you have to go though the larger dips on them just the same...IMO
1199 2018-03-22 19:57:48 Probably due to Facebook sell off along with other media stocks
1200 2018-03-22 19:57:40 SUCK IT NORMIES 

“Hey, how are your stocks doing Chad?”
1201 2018-03-22 19:57:17 Get Kevin off the tv. I am so over him already. We get it...he likes small cap stocks that pay a dividend. Lets move on.
1202 2018-03-22 19:57:13 Saying broad-brushed stereotypes make you sound ignorant. Be original not a puppet. The article was about stocks. Thanks for your service
1203 2018-03-22 19:57:10 There are those who don't care about all this "winning" until they discover that their 401K's are probably in stocks. I keep having flashes of the stories my mother told me about growing up during the Depression.
1204 2018-03-22 19:57:06 hello yes I would like to buy $93737632726361616 worth of stocks in summer pls
1205 2018-03-22 19:56:39 Who knew?
1206 2018-03-22 19:56:37 What if public firms traded on the stock exchange (but perhaps merely as a show) do not issue stocks or simply deliver them to foreigners? It's a sham, in the U.S. it would be a crime to run things that way.
1207 2018-03-22 19:56:16 Hey Russian Bots, Yes, Look at the stock market...do you see where it is compared to one year ago. Its down today, but much higher overall. Don't buy in short term...just a hint! (if bots buy stocks)
1208 2018-03-22 19:55:45 Hey stocks are outperforming Bitcoin at least
1209 2018-03-22 19:55:41 there had better be some wah-wah trombones on @Marketplace today (it's the only saving grace of a gruesome day in stocks).
1210 2018-03-22 19:55:19 Stocks are on sale!!
1211 2018-03-22 19:55:18 Dow skids below level at 24,000 as stocks tumble 740 points at session lows
1212 2018-03-22 19:55:16 -707 DOW
YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME (no Stocks)
BUT THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD @POTUS
1213 2018-03-22 19:54:49 It will certainly tank with these tarriffs as so many retailers are going to fall short as a result. I am not a wise one for how to manage any stocks or accounts. But I do understand retail, and I am living on a fixed income & get the need for cost effective goods.
1214 2018-03-22 19:54:33 psst buy coal stocks. Donald will make coal stocks great again!

1216 2018-03-22 19:54:27 tbh i think bump stocks are gay and only exist to try and get around automatic weapon bans
1217 2018-03-22 19:54:13 Sell your stocks now while you can.  Wall Street will crash if Trump imposes tariffs, and it won't be pretty.
1218 2018-03-22 19:53:58 @realdonaldtrump is making America ‘un-great’ !!! Your tariff on steel:aluminum is bringing down the stocks to their knees! Is this what Putin tell you to do, puppet of Russia?
1219 2018-03-22 19:53:54 ...quick, before the close, what should I buy?  Any overly-sold stocks you found?
1220 2018-03-22 19:53:49 So did Trump, his family and friends sell off or short their stocks before the tariffs sanctions announcement? I bet somehow they did! Corrupt crooked.
1221 2018-03-22 19:53:46 I wonder if Trump will "change his mind" about tariffs after he realizes stocks are going to keeping falling? #tradewar #tradewarjitters
1222 2018-03-22 19:53:33 Oh God. Start buying stocks in fall out shelters and canned goods!
1223 2018-03-22 19:53:06 Hey @realDonaldTrump thanks for constantly doing things that cause stocks to go to shit.
1224 2018-03-22 19:52:52 TECH STOCKS. TRADE WARS. THE DOW IS TAKING A 700-POINT SHIT. IT'S DAYS LIKE TODAY THAT YOU REALIZE THE ONLY THING ANCHORING YOU TO A SOLID FINANCIAL PLAN ARE YOUR BRASS FUCKING BALLS
1225 2018-03-22 19:52:51 @DICKS maybe you shouldn’t sell guns to men? Your stocks may plunge, but you’ll be the belle at your next dinner party. @benshapiro

1230 2018-03-22 19:52:11 Lyin Ryan loves his b.s. propaganda. How much does he have invested in military stocks? He keeps pushing funding increases but opposes oversight as to how it's being spent. Stop government and military waste.
1231 2018-03-22 19:52:04 @realDonaldTrump Good thing you don't own a lot of stocks.
1232 2018-03-22 19:51:41 Steel and aluminum stocks getting hammered (again) across the board - so much for the benefits of tariffs...
1233 2018-03-22 19:51:29 I have a handful of stocks green. I feel like I won the lottery.

1234 2018-03-22 19:51:27 stocks may be withering but muni bonds are on the rebound today
#muniland @TheTerminal
1235 2018-03-22 19:51:22 Stocks are dropping hard going into the close. The S&P is down 2.4% and the Dow fell as much as 743 points. Before that, there were signs investors were growing a little less worried about US-China trade tensions.
1236 2018-03-22 19:51:10 Anyway idk much about stocks but uhh it's like hella dropping.

1240 2018-03-22 19:49:42 Don’t worry about what happens in the stocks. Focus on the business earnings, expenditures, and what the company does when they have a surplus of income.
1241 2018-03-22 19:49:19 Lock your money up in Cd’s and stocks. Don’t procrastinate!

1253 2018-03-22 19:47:27 All these folks on TV keep saying the fundamentals for most individual stocks remain strong. That may be true... but it’s little consolation for over crowded index funds who *must sell* when they get $100’s of millions in redemptions pouring in.

1258 2018-03-22 19:46:44 Yes I do and the fact that you need that kind of gun to hunt makes me question what kind of shot you actually are. But I digress... Yes, the request is to ban all assault weapons, high cap mags, bump stocks and enforce regulation on access and purchase of weapons.

1282 2018-03-22 19:38:07 Really?  My stocks dropped sharply again today.  Seems to be the norm which I attribute to the destructive decisions by the Trump administration.  The middle class will shoulder the brunt of this. Watch costs rise, America.  Don't be fooled.

1290 2018-03-22 19:35:28 A company can issue a token that would act as if it was stocks that paid dividends and gave token holders voting rights. The company would register with the SEC as well. I see Blockchain technology cutting out traditional stockbrokers and not the SEC.
1291 2018-03-22 19:34:46 This is my last year being an employee for real, finna save all my money up and put that shit into stocks and start my studio full time by the end of the year. 2k18 gunna be my year baby.

1293 2018-03-22 19:34:00 Why are we ignoring sanctuary cities/states...Govt needs to pull funding and start arresting those responsible.  As far as bump stocks the NRA was against them...you can thank Obama for bringing them back.  Republicans need to get a backbone and stand up

1307 2018-03-22 19:28:46 Well is your objective simply to enact gun control or save lives?
When we look at who is responsible for the most firearm related deaths, it is suicides and gang violence.

1310 2018-03-22 19:27:44 With rise in interest rate, I guess some low dividend paying stocks are falling out of favor
1311 2018-03-22 19:27:17 I'm unsure of how all this works, but do heavy investors have a say in what happens in BigHit? Like creative direction and such. If so, I hope that stocks being owned by employees and fans can help protect the musical interests & creative freedom of the artists.

The Vegas shooter used (perfectly legal) AR-15’s, he used (perfectly legal) bump stocks, and he used (perfectly legal) high capacity magazines.

Your argument must be really horrible if you have to lie to make it.

1337 2018-03-22 19:20:03 @Fibonacciqueen Hi! You've once said that your approach does not work on penny stocks..Why do you think so?
1338 2018-03-22 19:20:03 Investors wonder if #TrumpTariffs will spell trouble for U.S. stocks. Beijing is already tightening credit, putting pressure on Chinese assets. China’s 2015 stock-market plunge weighed on U.S. and world markets temporarily wiping out trillions of dollars in market capitalization.

Who never lobbied for bump stocks, who the past administration shuffled paperwork on, which aren't used in crime. 
"Move the needle", it's a waste of time - and only needs a policy change to enact it. 

So, you are not about saving lives. 
Just #guncontrol.

1341 2018-03-22 19:19:41 What's the big deal with bump stocks?
1342 2018-03-22 19:19:38 Given the fact that Corporates have been the only net buyer of stocks since 2010, this is prescient to say the least. Markets are well and truly screwed without BB's!
1343 2018-03-22 19:19:37 Then oil is too high since deal w Saudi & gas prices rise
Then interest rates too high to buy house
Then tariffs raise prices of everything
Then stocks crash so 401k gets raided
Then tax revenue used to pay interest on debt so can't help recover from recession

1391 2018-03-22 19:03:06 Bump stocks simply replicate a technique that can also be preformed with a belt. So unless you're going to ban belts as well it would do nothing to ban bump stocks. As for high capacity magazines, all you're doing is preventing law abiding citizens from having them.

1458 2018-03-22 18:39:40 Stocks seldom go up in straight lines and often trade in channels before breaking out higher. Noticing patterns increases your gains exponentially.
1459 2018-03-22 18:39:34 IF YOU WANNA ACQUIRE STOCKS JUST KNOW UPFRONT YOU GOTTA PAY TAXES ON THEM SHITS
1460 2018-03-22 18:38:15 The 2nd Amendment is written for weapons of defense That’s BS Semi auto automatics & bump stocks r designed to murder people The 2nd Amen isn’t about protectingmg ur right to commit mass murder
1461 2018-03-22 18:38:03 Also, when you have identified a couple of stocks that you REALLY f*ck with, over time, you will pick up on times to buy more than normal.
1462 2018-03-22 18:37:05 But what the hell, the economy&debt is on the edge of collapse, the stocks going to blast, silver ready to go up and bitcoin not gaining momentum? I´m a bit confused!
Or they are playing hard with it or we are really those delusional idiots you were saying before.
1463 2018-03-22 18:36:57 In my high school econ class we’re doing a stock market project. Each student was given $100,000 to buy at least 5 different stocks to track over the next month. 

Of course the market drops like crazy this week. They may be traumatized.
1464 2018-03-22 18:36:48 So if the bill doesn’t get passed all the MJ stocks will tumble down!
1465 2018-03-22 18:36:13 .@hm Hi H&M, I am based in Northamptonshire, where is my nearest H+M store that stocks ‘Home’ stuff? TIA.

1472 2018-03-22 18:34:38 Umm...if you are in cryto you should not be in it for bunts. A doubling of your money is a bunt. At this price point #XRP distance from ATH is roughly 600%. That is home run numbers. If I wanted average numbers I would just trade stocks or #BTC.
1473 2018-03-22 18:34:12 Most likely fade these lower priced stocks get a huge spike and quickly drop off its highs
1474 2018-03-22 18:33:59 I really wish @realDonaldTrump would stop the tariff talk because my stocks are taking a beating.
1475 2018-03-22 18:33:09 Stocks cut 1/2 of losses after Trump talks tariffs, but eases trade war fears.
1476 2018-03-22 18:32:56 Stop talking.. start doing. I've been feet first on everything since I graduated. My firsts in the past 6 months: LLC est., bought crypto & stocks, business taxes, accounting, started 2 businesses, signed a producer, sought legal advice, etc.
1477 2018-03-22 18:32:56 My instincts (whatever this may b), is telling me to get out of this Market. Only own 2 stocks though $XLU $IBM(not selling) 
$SPY $QQQ $DIA

1479 2018-03-22 18:32:01 ...+Not to mention that SM also use those monet to buy big stocks from so many company this year. At the end of the day, after they got their sales from those projects and promotions, they are still the big 3. And your faves' company is still too far from them. That's it.

1481 2018-03-22 18:31:37 GOP thinking is this: Investors buy more companies or stocks. Banks increase business lending. Owners invest in their operations and hire workers. Problem is workers "aka Middle America" gets NOTHING. look at the #'s. everything goes to the top. while they cut programs for us
1482 2018-03-22 18:31:26 Bump stocks may be regulated into the same class as other NFA items, but I don't see an outright ban happening.
1483 2018-03-22 18:30:57 iShares MSCI Emerging market ETF crashes more than 3%....Beware of FII selling tomorrow in stocks like HDFC twins, ICICI, Maruti etc...

1491 2018-03-22 18:29:03 Pre 1973 there were lots of fish.
There were so many fishermen they de-populated vast areas of our coastal waters, like the firth of Clyde. Fishing was already in decline. It’s only imposing quotas that’s allowed stocks to start recovering.
1492 2018-03-22 18:29:03 Some politicians have stocks in uber. They're with them.
1493 2018-03-22 18:29:01 Could cause stocks to go lower short term though?
1494 2018-03-22 18:28:49 trump keep messing with my stocks , he gots to go
1495 2018-03-22 18:28:41 U.S. stocks slid on Thursday, but were off session lows, after President Donald Trump said he planned to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, but his action was far removed from threats that could have ignited a global trade war.

1498 2018-03-22 18:27:38 Hehe problem is stocks can't go up on low vol but sure as hell can fall on it.good concept to grasp.

1500 2018-03-22 18:25:24 Watching top banks stocks carefully tomorrow. Most have slid by 2% today and that's significant for those with a billion plus in market share.
1501 2018-03-22 18:25:16 TRUMP & HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS ARE MAKING MONEY HANDS OVER FIST, BY TRUMP CONTROLLING THE CHINA TARIFFS TRADE, BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET JUST TANKED, 400 POINTS DOWN., NOW TRUMP &  HIS SUPER RICH FRIENDS WILL BUY LOW & AT A LATER DATE SELL THEIR STOCKS HIGH & MAKE A BIG PROFIT.
1502 2018-03-22 18:25:13 So why is Trump trying to make bump stocks illegal if the 2a is absolute and shall not be infringed?
1503 2018-03-22 18:24:32 Well......13% down from my mid Jan high...not  good and in the 'do I hold or cut losses on a couple of stocks' frame of mind...

1511 2018-03-22 18:20:18 is #Nifty, #Sensex experiencing worst Month of March since 2009? 
Does this mean all "Tax-saving" investments (Typically they pour in March) are going into dumb stocks?? 
@Arun2981 can you look into this?

1520 2018-03-22 18:19:02 shame on you, @SpeakerRyan .  A simple clause in the unread omnibus bill you are cramming through would have saved lives by banning bump stocks.  You didn't put it in there.  Step aside.  You are not leading.
1521 2018-03-22 18:18:59 @YahooIndia inefficient space use on Yahoo Finance. The markets tracker on the top is using hell lot of space. To view more than 8 stocks, one has to scroll down. That is quite annoying. Please move the portfolio space/section up
1522 2018-03-22 18:17:34 Really, it’s all about stocks and bonds
1523 2018-03-22 18:17:03 There's a difference between market capitalization and operating profit.
That article includes all stocks of the Big3 means their overall market value
1524 2018-03-22 18:16:10 weekly support at .06 ... not a huge fan of this one because its so bloated share wise... but it is in better position than most other OG MJ stocks like $MJNA $GRNH $TRTCD $ERBB etc... so if looking for an OG this one is okay
1525 2018-03-22 18:15:52 Do you even know the difference between Net profit and market capitalization?
Obviously BigHit won't be in this because they are a Private limited company meaning they have no stocks

1527 2018-03-22 18:15:00 I meant 4, nigga. A lot of stocks do grow over time but a lot also don't. It's not a definite at all.
1528 2018-03-22 18:14:51 yessss i kno...i was just clarifying bc op said “imagine having this large stocks but bighit still has higher net profit lmao” and those two factors have no correlation??? stocks don’t go into ur net profit so it doesn’t even matter? just trying to be helpful
1529 2018-03-22 18:14:38 All of which would make a negligible difference in a school. Bump stocks are plastic toys suitable only for rednecks shooting pumpkins in the back 40. No operator would consider using one, because they aren't a serious accessory.

Aftermarket accessories for Glocks abound too.
1530 2018-03-22 18:14:35 shhh it okay all of SM's senior artists own company stocks, meaning that what SM is doing right now is actually bringing huge profits to EXO. Not just now while they are active- but forever. Sehun is 24 now, but even if he retired now he'd be a multimillionaire for life
1531 2018-03-22 18:12:22 me trying to learn stocks is just me re reading the definition to "calls" and "puts" every 5 minutes because I have the memory of a goldfish now
1532 2018-03-22 18:11:23 Stocks plunged as CHS Inc. unveiled a dirty tennis racket today.

1544 2018-03-22 18:10:23 Vishal, all Nifty stocks or sector specific stocks are branches of the same tree, if PNB crashes another 20%...you can’t expect BOB or SBI to outperform...they’ll fall too along with it..
1545 2018-03-22 18:10:21 If it double tops here seems like we'd have a raging bull market. So I'd look for stocks that have done well this week and watch for them to get even stronger. Yep, all roads lead back to buying more $BYOC

1549 2018-03-22 18:09:00 In down markets I buy companies that I'd be willing to work for and that I am willing to hold if the mkt melts down further. That's why I bought Smuckers, Disney and Google today. #investing #buyandhold #stocks #investments #CNBC #money #NYSE

1583 2018-03-22 18:00:20 im gonna repeat this again but 1st thing bighit is a private company they don't issue stocks, second it's a big achievement to even get their name here becoz once upon a time they were a small broke company and now they're single handedly slaying kpop industry with just @BTS_twt

1586 2018-03-22 17:59:56 your buying price is high...you can average around 130-145 level and hold for long term, it will give excellent return...it is in the same league as of bajaj finance...use market correction to build the portfolio...buy good stocks like cdsl, l&tfinance, tata global etc
1587 2018-03-22 17:58:43 If you’re getting at bump stocks then yes I agree they should be banned but bump fire is a technique that can be shot with any semi auto gun
1588 2018-03-22 17:58:38 If the DOW fills the session's gap on the chart, my suspicion will be confirmed that there is switching back into stocks.  Inside word is "NO WAY" will Uncle Sam put Facebook out of business with $40K fines. People are calming down... a little.  Bonds below 20-min and 40-min avg.
1589 2018-03-22 17:58:20 @Tiam so basically you are shorting two cult stocks...thats not a lot of tricks btw.

1594 2018-03-22 17:56:32 I watch the daily trading of the big banks stocks. Most days trading in brisk and stocks bounce up and down throughout the day. Today all those I have viewed have slid down all day. Significant?
1595 2018-03-22 17:55:22 I’ve been able to leverage my bag of beans and got on the crypto currency train, cashed out a week before the Crash. I’m going all in on old-school tech stocks.
1596 2018-03-22 17:55:00 As a vet, that's good news to hear.

Your STOP school violence Act is a small step in right direction.

A better screening process should be implemented 4 gun acquisitions. Elimination of high capacity mags, bump stocks & gun shows should also b part of solution.
1597 2018-03-22 17:54:59 Yes a projected we turned over to someone else to continue on.  We did not have the resources or connection with clearing companies and exchanges to follow it further down the rabbit hole.

We lost faith in the ETF baskets and buy stocks not included in these $GDX $GDXJ pools
1598 2018-03-22 17:53:27 This is great. It would also be great if @TIAA divested all gun stocks in support of the educators whose retirement funds they invest.

1601 2018-03-22 17:52:09 How can @Citi restrict financial usage for gun merchants for people under 21? Isn't that discrimination based on age? Aren't bump stocks/ high capacity magazines legal and a lifestyle choice? How can you be forced to bake a gay wedding cake but they are ALLOWED to discriminate?
1602 2018-03-22 17:51:48 stocks/dividends are not included in net profit?

1609 2018-03-22 17:50:30 Markets remain pressured as the US implements tariffs on China to the amount of $50 billion and possibly up to $60 billion. EU likely exempted but not 100% sure yet. Negotiations with China & EU continue in the meanwhile

1617 2018-03-22 17:47:12 norway etc. have much better cod stocks as they have not been subjected to the eu's bollocks policy on fishing. larger net gradient and a limit on total tonnage instead of type have had a much better effect than telling fishermen to dump excess catches back into sea.

1708 2018-03-22 17:12:53 Who gave these delulu kpopies the idea that SM has any claim or share over BigHit?Taking part in a project together suddenly means you have claims over the other's financial stocks? The day they will start thinking logically, the sun will rise in the west istg.
1709 2018-03-22 17:12:32 Why is EVERYONE so adverse to stocks dropping 10% or 20%?  It's great to buy things at lower prices!

1716 2018-03-22 17:09:53 "But if you take away the devil's projectile, he's just going to use the next most dangerous thing." Somebody said that to me once. Bump stocks aren't dangerous by themselves. By your logic, they should be legal.
1717 2018-03-22 17:09:25 Stocks plunge as Trump Tariffs tank markets. How’s that 401K doing now?

1722 2018-03-22 17:08:07 We need to be careful here as risk aversion dominates. Dow down nearly 500 and sentiment is shifting. This could be a defining Close in US stocks if this continues. No bounce at all so far...

1735 2018-03-22 17:05:43 This is the silliest conversation I’ve ever been a part of. If you think you need to be educated on bump stocks, then by all means.  I’m sure you have an excellent reason for it. I have to go back to intelligent arguments now.

1747 2018-03-22 17:03:07 But during WWII, Germany could only produce combustible gas from Coal. Which is very expensive to do. Furthermore, Germany had no easy access to fuel oil. What stocks it did have, it had to prioritize to its Army, Navy, Air Force. 

Therefore the Fables don't match the science.

1754 2018-03-22 17:02:07 A car is designed for transportation. All its other uses stem from that. A gun is designed to kill. All its other uses stem from that. They aren't the same and you know it. But if you really believe this argument, then why are we banning bump stocks?
1755 2018-03-22 17:01:22 He only cares about this bc it affects his bottom line - if stocks had not tanked we would not be hearing how he is sorry.  He is only sorry bc he lost money.  That is all that matters to him, not our democratic process.

1757 2018-03-22 17:00:34 Also they cant grasp the difference between a private company (Bighit) and public ones (sm,jyp). How can someone bring stocks into the argument about a companies operating profit, when that company is a private one

What is your answer to urban homicide, 70% of which occurs in 1.7% of cities. 
Age Limits? BGC? Criminals ignore them
Rifles? Bump Stocks? Criminals don't use them
#guncontrol? Disarms citizens, doesn't apply to Criminals.

1776 2018-03-22 16:55:35 A great buy signal and which should of been yours if you wanted to take a shot is when the $SPY hit $266. Many stocks bounced within a few minutes of when that price hit dipped below then went back above it. #quickprofitstightstops
1777 2018-03-22 16:55:02 @realDonaldTrump when you are high, the stocks go down.

1778 2018-03-22 16:55:01 I know the limited stocks and flash sales shiz are annoying for Xiaomi customers. I've also been critical of the company on this.

But to allege that the sales are fake or allege that the company is in collusion with black marketeers as response to every tweet is ludicrous.

Then use 3m for chills, change wardrobe, and help some people.

20m is really small though. Increase it to 60 then I buy 2015 Passat cc

1802 2018-03-22 16:45:57 It sounded good until he got to "Ban bump stocks".  conversation over...
1803 2018-03-22 16:45:48 "You" have not been - focusing on AD (low occurrence), Suicide (choice), BGC (criminals ignore), Bump Stocks (not used in crime), age, etc.
Since you're looking I'll ask your solution to criminal firearm use in 1.7% of US cities. You advocated incremental improvement, right?
1804 2018-03-22 16:45:40 if blue wave validated by midterms, it looks like an abandoned refrigerator cud beat Trump.  Dem jostling to get prez nom shud be pretty intense.  Also expect plenty of primary challenges to the Donald.  Note to self: buy media stocks

1807 2018-03-22 16:44:54 But look at the performances of some of those stocks compared to peers over the same period - not good.
1808 2018-03-22 16:44:39 Can the @SEC_News please verify that Trump is not purposely tanking the stock market to allow comrades to buy stocks at a reduced premium.
1809 2018-03-22 16:43:47 All in all, it looks like the UK fishing industry (and quite probably the other Europeans as well) fished themselves out of a job by utterly failing to manage the stocks post WW2.
1810 2018-03-22 16:43:41 If you're not directly invested in the market - pension, IRA, stocks, etc. - then you're indirectly affected by investment in growth, tax revenues, interest rates on savings and debt that translate to fees and charges, and costs of everyday items.
1811 2018-03-22 16:43:15 I'm really shocked by the weakness in consumer goods stocks. These are classic defensive stocks; Procter & Gamble, Altria, Kraft Heinz all at new lows today.

All these stocks will be down due to this expectation of 100% margin

1828 2018-03-22 16:37:55 From BBG: $50 Billion Is the Goods Amount, Not The Tax Amount

As it turns out, the tariff is on $50 billion worth of goods...a substantially smaller cohort. That in turn should be less deleterious overall...hence the little pop in stocks.
1829 2018-03-22 16:37:35 These stocks tend to really bottom on or around Congressional testimony. The price action the last 2-3 days has been good, but there hasn't been 1 downgrade yet & the stock isn't really that much off the highs. I'd prefer $155-$134 if the Market softens up more.

1841 2018-03-22 16:34:58 That’s not the problem. You know Bezos got a brothas back. Cannabis stocks are and will be a whirlwind until July when Canada legalized recreational. It’s been up as much as 11% and down as much as 40%. I’m on pins and needles hoping brotha.
1842 2018-03-22 16:34:54 Once stocks start getting comfortable around 200dma ... they’re bound to go test lower price levels ... so many retail names doing this it’s got me like  ... and the exact opposite when they start settling above 200dma after long term downtrend ...
1843 2018-03-22 16:34:52 Get rid of bump stocks... we don't need them. If someone wants to, they can get the same function by using a belt. We can then outlaw belts and all look like thugs. 
1844 2018-03-22 16:34:31 Yeah you’re a joke you listen to the media and their bunch of jackasses Trump is doing a great job!! We have billions of dollars coming back into The USA because of his tax plan unemployment is the lowest been 40 years!! Stocks and bonds are at record highs.....

1850 2018-03-22 16:33:50 LVT is not efficient. It misses 70% of unearned wealth which is in stocks instead of land. A 2% wealth tax is just as easy to collect and taxes both land and stock, both of which are valued at inflated levels by circumstances that their investment played no role in providing.

1861 2018-03-22 16:31:18 Lets see how many of his buddies conveniently dropped stocks that were affected. Still nothing on the insider trading from the steel (re:steal) stocks,, so i guess "when you're a star , you can anything".
1862 2018-03-22 16:30:53 if pistol grips, magazines, and collapsible butt stocks make no difference, then why do the weapon designers include these features on military weapons?
1863 2018-03-22 16:29:56 I don’t know why people want ARs, or bump stocks. I don’t own any firearms so I can’t speak to that. However, as of right now, they are legally able to do so
1864 2018-03-22 16:29:43 Staying in the CFP would indeed be a very sensible thing to do. It's based on the determination by marine biologists of how large fish stocks are & what amount may be sustainably fished. Canada that has not had such a policy has seen cod stocks go extinct & communities devastated
1865 2018-03-22 16:29:17 @realDonaldTrump could have done me a solid and told me the tariff announcement was today.

Would have bought stocks today instead of Tuesday.
1866 2018-03-22 16:28:28 Jim, should I buy stocks now before trump officially lays out tariff policy , or wait til tomorrow to buy stocks . I think trump will announce tariff policy after th market closes today
1867 2018-03-22 16:27:07 2 stocks each month:

1868 2018-03-22 16:27:06 I’d love to find out that 45 is making these negative pronouncements…like the steel tariffs and China tariffs…just to sink the market so he and cohorts could manipulate stocks. Carl Icahn already is being looked at after the steel deal.

1911 2018-03-22 16:18:19 I'll tell you. The fish in UK's waters were running out. Overfishing was destroying stocks. Quotas were designed to keep the fish numbers healthy. As usual the Brexiters think it's some sort of attack on the UK.

1916 2018-03-22 16:16:27 No idea. But presumably to allow other EU countries to enjoy fishing in UK waters. If you are suggesting its to preserve stocks, I don't see how it does if the fish die in the process of being caught anyway, they just cant be sold. Good for the seagulls though!

1985 2018-03-22 16:05:14 we require new retail sector clients or partners to adhere to these practices: they don’t sell firearms to someone who hasn’t passed a background check, restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21 years of age, + they don’t sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.

In Aksh Optifibre, it's a 7 year long bottom formation process. Now is the  best to invest Mark Minervini way.
2024 2018-03-22 15:56:56 I do the same.  Worst case scenario, it will still do better than a savings account or stocks over the long term.

2097 2018-03-22 15:36:30 The EU sets quotas. The purpose of the quotas is to preserve fish stocks (i.e. prevent over-fishing).
In other words, this day, this week, this month and this year, they are telling us not to over-fish, whilst at the same time, stealing our fish.
The CFP is at the HEART of this!

2204 2018-03-22 15:14:38 Random  unoriginal thought on stocks . In the short run stocks can move sharply in either direction but in long there is  100% correlation with profits/ cash generated.  So any sensible investment strategy must be long term & focus on sustainable, predictible profitability
2205 2018-03-22 15:13:51 Stocks in sell off mode thanks to stupid trade policy. What more can I say. Economy and everything cruising. And now this bit of ignorance. #china could be our friend. No point of making them the enemy.

2217 2018-03-22 15:10:12 As mentioned a week ago, a number of these stocks like X and TWTR made new recovery highs and had big MACD bear divergences. They have more consolidation to go, as these big formations go further than one thinks.
2218 2018-03-22 15:10:00 2. Expected outcome: Supporters of #Trump love it (now), short term gains (more #US products sold & more jobs), long term similar agreements in place (maybe a bit better 4 US), with more volatility in the middle (impacts on jobs & markets/stocks).

2358 2018-03-22 14:23:53 Well, who is "everyone"?  Most reasonable people want restrictions on the acquisition of bump stocks, meaningful background checks, no sales to mentally ill or domestic abusers, waiting periods. "Everyone" is mostly the NRA and their bought and paid for minions.
2359 2018-03-22 14:23:08 US #stocks fall sharply on renewed trade-war fears. The Japanese Yen is now gathered further traction vs. its American peer and is forcing $USDJPY to drop and challenge YTD lows in the 105.30/20 area.
2360 2018-03-22 14:22:48 a market lead by short covering is not a strong market,, it needs real bulls with cash,, they say who is left to buy once a bear covers.  technically we only have bulls taking profits in 98% of stocks, bears are still rare like unicorns

2363 2018-03-22 14:22:09 Just got back to my desk and seen this. Still mega undervalued. Its one of my best stocks at the moment and my single largest position too. Looking forward to seeing the next few weeks.
2364 2018-03-22 14:21:56 I have no issue with being armed and protected. I am too. Nobody wants to change that. Just the ability to buy assault weapons and bump stocks.  It’s unfortunate that people can’t separate the two topics. SAD

2368 2018-03-22 14:21:24 Sorry if you didn't get the gist of my answer. Of course banning knives would be silly. Some pure common sense gun law reform would be a great place to start. I see no reason that anyone would need an assault rifle, or bump stocks. Does that answer your question?

Stocks down again Drumpf. Because of you, idiot.
2490 2018-03-22 13:37:11 You’re exactly correct.  They probably get money under the table for voting, plus they have access to information on stocks etc. it would be nice to require then to state their wealth before & after office.

2492 2018-03-22 13:36:28 U.S. stock futures were sharply lower on Thursday, with technology stocks dropping on fears of increased regulations in the wake of Facebook Inc's data privacy issues, while the Trump administration's move to impose import tariffs on China stoked ...
2493 2018-03-22 13:36:26 London stocks had extended losses by midday on Thursday as the pound held its gains after the Bank of England kept interest rates steady, as expected, while signalling that an increase in May might be on the cards.
2494 2018-03-22 13:34:22 The past about gun control but because of these kids saying enough, changes are being made. The notion that they want to take everything away is false. That's the rhetoric you guys use to keep the argument going. Raise the age, ban bump stocks, ban sale of assault
2495 2018-03-22 13:34:17 I wonder how much big-hit stocks will be going for?
2496 2018-03-22 13:33:55 Comrades! US Central Bank raises rates .25% with a promise for more MAKING THE FREE MONEY A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE driving stocks down. Also the whole politico-economic situation deteriorating giving gamblers nervousness...

2499 2018-03-22 13:33:15 Stocks falling already ahead of Dotard's stupid tariff announcement. I really hope Xi reams Dotard over this dumb shit.
2500 2018-03-22 13:32:59 Facebook is crooked. Like CNN,they filter out political post that go against their agenda.  Like Uranium 1, Bill Clinton's $500,000 speaking tour to Russia, Email scandal, IRS scandal, Fast & Furious, "After my election, "I'll have more flexibility", CNN stocks (TBS/A) suck too
2501 2018-03-22 13:32:45 I have a lifetime of documents (stocks, property, retirement accounts, passport, social security card, global entry card, drivers license, degrees, etc etc ) in my name. The overhead of changing isn't worth it. I'd known I'm married without being labeled by him.
2502 2018-03-22 13:31:59 Leading stocks will be tested today.  How they act in face of general weakness will be a telling sign for the health of this market.
2503 2018-03-22 13:31:34 i think owning airline stocks is a great emotional hedge to the indignity of flying. so, yeah, the experience sucks but every corner they cut is a small boost to EPS which then accrues to me!

2507 2018-03-22 13:30:44 Ah, why then do so many bump stocks sell?

You can make hot tea with a baby's sock, but it ain't recommended.
2508 2018-03-22 13:30:37 Please clarify? According to EU law the UK could fish exclusively to a limit 100 mile Why isn't this enforced? Secondly outside the EU the UK will still be subject to quotas to protect fish stocks which if necessary has to shared. Little different from what we have now!
2509 2018-03-22 13:30:25 No one shorts sub-penny stocks. There is no way around the 2.50/share in marginable securities that must be put up as collateral. But, the real issue here is the daily short interest numbers. PEOPLE, AND THIS INCLUDES EFLN MGT, NEED TO LEARN HOW TRADES ARE REPORTED.

2532 2018-03-22 13:22:49 Why are stocks in the red? Forget the Fed for the moment: Trade tensions and Facebook meltdown are hammering the stock market, one prompted by the president the other self-inflicted by FB.
2533 2018-03-22 13:22:42 “America is at an all-time high, and no other nation in the history of the world has ever been this in debt.” Veteran investor Jim Rogers was already predicting the worst bear market for stocks in his lifetime...and that’s before you figure in Trump's trade war. @AllJimRogers

2555 2018-03-22 13:16:02 That's not true. You know you can disassemble long guns, break them down by upper & lower receiver, stocks, to make them fit in normal suitcase? Anyone who knows firearms (I work with them) can tell you this. He could fit all of his arsenal in those 20+ suitcases.
2556 2018-03-22 13:15:17 Don't you worry. Stocks will rally on the EU exception from steel and aluminium tariffs.

2570 2018-03-22 13:11:01 Because stocks have an approx 30 year duration (life cycle of av us company). Therefore they should factor in everything over the period. All of this is BS of course as the FED can’t forecast out a year or two as Powell said himself yesterday.
2571 2018-03-22 13:10:59 YC - again, the U and V markets will dictate the pace. Very unlikely within next 6 months. Investing in U stocks, need to have longer term outlook than next 6 months.

2582 2018-03-22 13:05:05 The AR15 civilians have access to doesn’t have automatic capability. True. This is the only thing that allows you to claim it isn’t a weapon of war. 

But here’s the funny part. Soldiers almost never use their rifles on full automatic. Also...bump stocks.
2583 2018-03-22 13:03:34 ie. Amzn $1,565/$53 Apr 20 ATM call = 30x....or better yet $1,565/$620 mthly calls 1 yr = < 3x << these are the net true p/e's of stocks, option premiums = earnings.  Plus all the usual suspects, M & A, stock splits (neutral, but +), very low interest rates, div's. caveat 2 bears

Just like he said he would ban bump stocks, or not change his legal team...lies...

2601 2018-03-22 12:54:28 Less pumping of stocks and more pumping of process needed in the feed if you want to exceed. If you wonder why someone so passionate about there process then maybe its worth exploring some more.
2602 2018-03-22 12:54:25 The market doesn't like rate hikes due to liquidity and bond rate increases. Bank stocks might be a good option in this environment. That's my opinion, I could be wrong...
2603 2018-03-22 12:53:36 maybe a good example would be doing ur job to prevent the his would be making laws to ban bump stocks&auto.guns
2604 2018-03-22 12:53:07 Didn't see him do a damn thing about gun control while he was in office. For 8 years did nothing except allow the manufacturing of bump stocks. He's a farce, a fake and you clowns worship him.
2605 2018-03-22 12:52:41 Hope that this time actual earning in the tech stocks will cause a repeat to not occur. Or at least be less violent.  But, also this time, we got a Trump problem.

2607 2018-03-22 12:52:36 @kenkun @Egon12 Good old fashioned profits have been outlawed in the FAANG economy. Stocks should be traded with Pie In The Sky coins.
2608 2018-03-22 12:52:34 No hay mucho para discutir en este tema. Medir flujos y stocks per capita es mejor indicador que valores absolutos. Nadie discute eso. Lo otro es un chasquarrillo para los quejosos que no miran que estamos saliendo de una recesión donde las cosas pc caen.
2609 2018-03-22 12:51:14 @HotelChocolat I understand that the Wuntu offer is probably really popular and stocks are limited, but I didn't expect to be informed that the chocolate bunnies are out of stock at 11am, I think they should be restocked daily during the promotion, it was quite disappointing  :/
2610 2018-03-22 12:51:14 As a race we have driven many other species to extinction. People aren’t going extinct, but the white rhino is. Weird, maybe people aren’t “pretending” to care? 
2611 2018-03-22 12:51:08 They touched on the topic of possibility of BH going public. My heart is pumping so fast that I'm scared I'll have a heart attack. I can just imagine when the day comes when they open for stocks 
2612 2018-03-22 12:50:55 Hey FBN!!!! Quit crying 'sky is falling' when the big 30 stocks fall. The FOLKS and the economy are doing great!!!!

2614 2018-03-22 12:49:13 Stocks found support from the +3.0% increase in U.S. Feb existing home sales to 5.54 million (stronger than expectations of +0.4% to 5.40 million) and a rally in energy stocks after crude oil prices rose +2.57% to a 1-1/2 month high.
2615 2018-03-22 12:48:33 It’ll let me purchase regular stocks but for Cryptocurrencies it makes me wait and it’ll say something like there’s a waiting list of 1.1 million or something like wth lol
2616 2018-03-22 12:47:58 Stocks and bonuses are going overwhelmingly to the 1%. Read the tax plan... over the next 7 years, tax rebates for the lower tax brackets shrink, then swing back the other way. Cuts for the top bracket are permanent. You don't have to read this stuff, but it's foolish not to.

2620 2018-03-22 12:46:10 first of all @Wealthfront vol is higher than BW in the backtest. Then they used energy stocks and reits as proxy for commodities. Stocks/reits have done much better vs commodities. Do they do that also in the actual implementation? No commodities?

2634 2018-03-22 12:41:13 I think we got our answer this morning - I'm quite surprised how Market dislikes Rate 'normalisation' so much - usually Economic growth trumps Rate rises. I guess Stocks were too buoyant before.

2655 2018-03-22 12:31:41 I'll bet criminals are lining up to turn in their bump stocks and high capacity mags. You liberal sheeple are getting more and more ignorant every year. If you would just make murder illegal, all the violence would stop.

2657 2018-03-22 12:30:55 I could argue there there are just as many if not more shit stocks and securities on global retail  "regulated" markets as there are shitcoins that will probably fail.  I see very little difference.

2660 2018-03-22 12:29:39 Because there isn’t this <2% of Americans trying to control the 65% of Americans who want stricter gun laws, banning assault weapons (see @Vets4GunReform), and shutter to think how it takes another attack to take action on bump stocks and that still didn’t occur with legislation
2661 2018-03-22 12:29:30 More important; it’s the type of trawling( UK fish stocks were ripped ( by U.K. fishermen) using drag trawling ( ie dragging the bottom, which destroys bottom fauna, and fish breeding areas)

2670 2018-03-22 12:25:04 Yes but at least they don't have bump stocks.
2671 2018-03-22 12:24:59 last week nudnik was shouting how once the amzn, goog, FB and NFLX stocks stop running up daily the indices would crash. Out of nowhere he does a complete 180 and goes  full bullish at the farking top and gets an instant assbeating!  You can't make this shit up! TLT at 116 yet?
2672 2018-03-22 12:24:50 On that basis, wouldn’t a conventional 60/40 (stocks and bonds) also be a “bet”?
2673 2018-03-22 12:24:45 But it is the biggest tax cut and great tax reform. And I want...want everybody in this room because your stocks are right in there.
2674 2018-03-22 12:23:19 @latha_venkatesh also an PIL should be filed against psu banks management and the upa govt for hiding npas.

2681 2018-03-22 12:18:30 That was about managing fish stocks. Making sure people don't overfish. If UKIP were in charge they'd be no fish in ten years. Someone has to protect the stocks. Apparently the Brexiters don;t understand the situation.
2682 2018-03-22 12:18:09 #russia latest - @Amb_Yakovenko asks how did UK designate #skripal nerve agent so quickly? Did Porton Down hold stocks of Novichok? How was antidote administered so quickly? Is distance between Salisbury and Porton Down a coincidence?
2683 2018-03-22 12:17:39 My gold stocks look like they've just woken up and are groggily looking around. The question now - will they get up, or go back to sleep?

2694 2018-03-22 12:12:11 very helpful analysis of the DAX being caught between 11.800 (strong floor) and 13.680! In the middle the 200 days-mov. aver. of 12.700 will show the way for traders on a 3 - 6 months horizon. As I am more risk/reward oriented, I liked to buy/will add good stocks  below 11.999.
2695 2018-03-22 12:11:26 Bahaha, I thought that’s the only reason for reddit.

2696 2018-03-22 12:10:40 Stick strictly to valuation. Because stocks can be bought at good valuations in these corrections,corrections are actually good and when to enter will be decided by ur valuation. Buying at high PE will reduce ur gains and u will be forced to wave 3 where as in actual its wave 1

2701 2018-03-22 12:08:05 Let's not forget, they throw in learned helplessness and the delusional assumption of being part of an economically and culturally oppressed class too. What a bargain! It's all the neuroses you'll ever need! Get it today, while stocks last.
2702 2018-03-22 12:07:27 Hi - Do not trade individual stocks.  Track the main indices and work off the S&P, Gold, Crude and Dollar markets.   There really is no minimum, we're using ETF's mostly.  A lot about education in trading too.
2703 2018-03-22 12:06:58 $P has been my best climber this year. 5% or more 6 Times already.  The volatility it crazy  #Stocks.
2704 2018-03-22 12:06:37 I’m fine with compromising but that doesn’t mean anything if the politicians aren’t willing to do it. I’m fine with increased background checks and the removal of bump stocks. What I’m not okay with is taking away people’s God given rights.
2705 2018-03-22 12:06:10 Many traders get angered when they hear comments about why a name "might" be bearish. Trading is a constant battle of bulls vs. bears and when one realizes it is adaptation & mutation of factors, makes it much easier to see the stocks true nature. Bias trading can be dangerous.

2708 2018-03-22 12:04:08 ...but that was never his aim. His raison d'etre was to take UK out of the EU. For this he was voted into EU Parliament numerous times. He achieved that goal now UK can have "a real say in how fish stocks could be managed". Despite this you argue he should've done something else?

2740 2018-03-22 11:51:23 Looks like a good idea to stay away from the Qs & maybe look for stronger stocks in the sector until this FB garbage passes..

2742 2018-03-22 11:46:24 How about take away videos that show how to install bump stocks, then educate the children, and save lives?!  There’s THAT too!  No one is taking away your opinion, unless your opinion is that anyone should be allowed to install a bump stock....

Mr. Zuckerberg put more energy in selling stocks while his company was included in this turmoil/chaos clearly shows where his priorities are.
2768 2018-03-22 11:29:02 Good... then we may buy some bank stocks
2769 2018-03-22 11:29:01 For a Roth IRA, if you’re into individual dividend stocks as opposed to ETFs then look up the holdings of $VPU, $VYM, $VNQ and cherry pick. Buy them individually when they go on sale by following charts.

2784 2018-03-22 11:19:48 I’m not blaming Trump for the last two hundred years. I blame him for being all gung ho about gun safety, banning bump stocks, raising age for rifles til 21. He said all those things he was going to make happen. Met w/NRA. He stopped talking about gun reform. Did the same 1/2

2788 2018-03-22 11:18:09 The narrative that small cap stocks will outperform the general market in times of increasing trade tensions does not make sense. Over half of the $iwm revenues are international sales. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Maybe his frustration is from demos after Las Vegas against bump stocks (something which makes something else deadlier) whereas there's no demos for these ingredients to be tightly regulated
Who knows? Only him.
2814 2018-03-22 11:03:50 @facebook options “strike prices” which contracts can be exercised were $115 and $120, means stocks would have to plunge 32% and 29% to options get pay  out

2816 2018-03-22 11:00:25 But nobody can catch nonexistent fish.

We'd fished too much. There were none left. The UK voluntarily reduced the fleet as part of a global agreement in late 90s, to let stocks recover.

Voluntarily. Global.

Blaming the EU for that is, as Andrew Neil would say: "wrong"

But I admit FTSE’s rise since 2011 has been pathetic compared to the US markets, which went from around 10k to 26k, and just a year or two earlier, from 6k up to 26k. If you were wealthy and into stocks AND kept your job, you are way better.

2828 2018-03-22 10:49:28 "Loses $10B in 2 days", well it's not like a company directly benefits from the secondary market. And this dip due to privacy etc. - I THINK - mostly was due to speculation. "Stocks will dip, so I sell and rebuy once they're down. Money made, future profit planned."
2829 2018-03-22 10:47:36 Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg must be the strangest queers  (not in LGBT sense - the original) in British political history. They haven't a clue about the preservation of the north sea fisheries stocks which governs EU fisheries policy.

2833 2018-03-22 10:44:16 What @MayorGinther is proposing such as banning Bump Stocks. And further background checks is perfectly okay with me. Because he's not banning a gun. I am all for banning bump Stocks and the @NRA agrees with that!
2834 2018-03-22 10:43:33 Although this is factually correct, it would only be a "useful" fact if investors put all their money in stocks on December 31st 1999. Average return on stocks this millennium, assuming a more realistic "rolling investment" from 2000 on, has been higher than "just dividends".

2856 2018-03-22 10:29:01 So I’ve been such a big advocate of the fact that the Jan/Feb sell-off was not a one off event. Now we will go through the 2nd leg of that sell-off & as the investment consensus debacles opportunities to buy stocks cheaper will arise

2866 2018-03-22 10:22:25 I have no doubt the EU would wish to punish our fishing industry by introducing hefty tariffs to ensure our sales of fish stocks were crushed.
2867 2018-03-22 10:22:22 That tends to be how it goes in the stock market smh But stocks were already going down as it is because of how much the opioid conversation has been had this last year or so.

2880 2018-03-22 10:15:35 Wonder if we could have a period say during the transition that no one can fish our waters due to reduced stocks due to storms .
2881 2018-03-22 10:12:00 What gave you that idea? Absolutely not. My solution would be to come to an agreement with our neighbours which takes into account conservation of fish stocks and fishermen’s rights. Maybe each country could send, say, delegates to advocate for their citizens 
2882 2018-03-22 10:11:29 He makes silly headline grabbing stunts instead of actually attending fishery committee meetings where he could have had a real say in how fish stocks could be managed

2953 2018-03-22 09:30:49 With interest rates of ~0.5% that are still declining every year... still true, but a hard sell. Unless you’re looking into higher-than-zero-risk investments/savings like funds/stocks. But they require some time investment, otherwise it’s closer to gambling.

3099 2018-03-22 07:24:34 Only GMP (consisting stocks, bonds, real estate and stuff) is passive? That is so useless definition of active/passive. If you hold GMP + cash/leverage that makes it active or passive?

3102 2018-03-22 07:21:56 Because ‘plunder’ only happens when it is the #EU ... er, successfully managing quotas such that fish stocks have recovered.

What happens after #Brexit won’t be ‘plunder’. Even if it results in overfishing, nowhere to sell the fish, and eventually, depleted fish stocks

3106 2018-03-22 07:19:49 these acts of treachery by Mays govnt&capitulation over new fishing "rules" by the EUcould mean the destruction of NorthSea stocks for ever

3108 2018-03-22 07:17:39 the electricals stock I’m holding are close to my buying price. I believe with the growing demand in the electrical sector can create good amount of wealth. Most of the stocks are not so expensive and don’t have huge debt.

3110 2018-03-22 07:15:21 Don;t lose heart in the market:

If you are an investor with conviction, average Quality stocks at lower levels.
3111 2018-03-22 07:15:10 IDK but there must be something about these stocks embedded with cross trades especially basura stocks, maybe? 
3112 2018-03-22 07:14:25 They cancelled the order after placing saying the seller has cancelled it due to non availability of stocks, why accept the order if there is non availability. Atleast make it unavailable before hand !
3113 2018-03-22 07:14:07 If I keep constant 50-30-20 stocks vs. bonds vs. real estate allocation at all times, am I active or passive? Note that I am not market timing or doing security selection.

3129 2018-03-22 06:59:46 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
3130 2018-03-22 06:59:33 Just noticed: Most stocks with significant "cross" trades volume (1M+) tend to shoot up to 8-12% then crash 12%-18% the next day or two... are "cross" trades the pump signals for those in the know? idk but anyone have something to share about this magical cross trades please

If you are an investor with conviction, average Quality stocks at lower levels.

Stop is an aggressive 1.5 ATR below entry. A setup best for quiet bull markets. Exit when close below SMA50.

The boy tilted his head, he wished to know what sort of meat they had out here. The idea of food stocks never really got to him, since he didn’t know what he meant when he went through those explanations.
3231 2018-03-22 05:35:38 Sure, I get that. I also think bump stocks are a non issue. Used in exactly ONE mass shooting. Vegas story is filled with some very weird stuff though. 
If I were a conspiracy nut, I would say the goal was to build support for a bump stock ban as well as AR15
3232 2018-03-22 05:35:11 Stock@market is all about making money    Whether bear or bull market  or else in a bear market we will be sitting with no capital and praying for the stocks to go up
3233 2018-03-22 05:35:02 Likelihood of not being volatile and dumping sinking stocks sounds like a fair deal to me.

3238 2018-03-22 05:29:47 So the UK fishermen who:

3239 2018-03-22 05:29:38 Daily some stocks have to be Top gainers and some Top Losers....if no big news...then Crude up and down is always news...As it’s also beaten down stock...some rise is justified but our purpose is to short any rising stock!

3244 2018-03-22 05:25:21 Of course he did, because that’s what the US was telling everyone based on intelligence they knew they had no right to rely upon. And again: 1441 was based on presumed WMD stocks at the time, not in the 80s.

3260 2018-03-22 05:10:02 Nope. I think the sale of $4CE Mt Adrah was a bum deal, and think some of his comments on twitter inflate the SP of certain stocks, but nothing against the guy personally. I’ve DM’d him and he’s polite. Doesn’t mean I can’t think his stock is overpriced.
3261 2018-03-22 05:09:34 He is worrying about everything why don’t you let him decide what’s next on the agenda. Securing our borders should BE a TOP priority. He is working on pushing legislation to ban bump stocks and I think the FBI has a good handle on the Austin bombings. He can’t do everything.

Trades like this are trading away a high ceiling in exchange for a higher floor and shorter timeline.

3352 2018-03-22 03:58:27 There’s got to be some interpretation of the Constitution that says we’re allowed to put Betsy DeVos and Ben Carson in the stocks and throw rancid fruit at them after they leave office. Where’s Erwin Chemerinsky when you need him
3353 2018-03-22 03:57:43 Did you notice the shooter was armed with a handgun? Not an AR-15 w/high capacity magazines? Makes a difference when the defender is armed with a handgun also. That’s why assault style weapons w/high capacity magazines & bump stocks should be banned. It’s not rocket science.

3373 2018-03-22 03:39:47 You can't say this would have ended as well if the kid had an AR15.  Ban semi-automatics, large capacity magazines and bump stocks.  Raise the age to purchase to 21.  Fix the background check system. #DoItNow

3406 2018-03-22 03:18:49 When you take a military assault rifle and do a minor (and trivial) conversion to make it semi-auto then the whole thing needs to go. High-capacity, modularity, flash-supressors, bump stocks, sear kits.. These are not aspects that should be readily available.

3416 2018-03-22 03:12:42 I guess I fail to see how. Whether it’s bump stocks or conversion kits, the end goal is to make a semi-auto rifle behave like a full-auto rifle. So why not ban the sale of any and all parts or kits? My concern is banning only one method of this practice vs all of them.

3451 2018-03-22 02:49:34 US #Fed has hiked by 25 bp; we're sure to see 3 more hikes.. this would dry up excess liquidity that we've experienced last year 2017. Impact on stocks will not be +ve. Mkt will bottom out for short-term in next 4-6 weeks. However, we'll end CY 2018 lower than where we're now...
3452 2018-03-22 02:47:50 You know you’re signing up for a good conference when the registration form includes the question “How often do you buy stocks priced under $7.00?"
3453 2018-03-22 02:47:28 Stocks didn't go down on Feds dovishness, they went down on the Feds faltering credibility.
3454 2018-03-22 02:47:10 @anilvohra69 Looking at the futures tonight, this is what I've been expecting--a phase with stocks, long bonds, gold and forex all moving higher simultaneously. Could be explosive, esp once equities break out to new highs. Small-caps only 2% away.
3455 2018-03-22 02:46:58 This guy sold stocks before news broke. Insider trading? Oh yes!

3467 2018-03-22 02:41:13 frankly, value investing is not about stock picking per se. its more like holding stocks cheaper than the market and beating the market in correction. Rule no 1 don't lose money type. so i dont view sun pharma as any growth story. it may give better than market return thats it.

3471 2018-03-22 02:39:29 about 6 months ago, i told all my friends to sell their facebook stocks. as a facebook user i saw the signs of the imminent fall.
3472 2018-03-22 02:39:18 I will be happy if i make 13-14% CAGR over next 2-3 yrs on my invested portfolio starting today.
i will deploy cash in stocks where i see upside more like 18-20% atleast. not many stocks are offering 18-20% upside in plain sight. don't get fooled if someone is promising you that.
3473 2018-03-22 02:38:01 @andersoncooper Did you ever think in a million years when planning a serious journalism career that you would allow yourself to be lowered to interviewing a porn star in the left's mania to bring down Trump?

3476 2018-03-22 02:35:59 Same. But now I hold hundreds (thousands?) of individual stocks. Don’t want to sell now and trigger cap gains. Also don’t really want to transfer and have to deal with cost of doing so many trades/sales later. So what’s the answer?
3477 2018-03-22 02:35:46 Didn’t he sell off stocks before news broke? Insider trading?
3478 2018-03-22 02:35:31 I am ashamed of nothing. I've done nothing wrong. YOU should be put in the public stocks.

3480 2018-03-22 02:34:30 Cash n stocks both. During '16 as well they maintained good cushion of cash till Feb. I see some beaten down scrips in their holdings. Their best part is they don't confuse with multiple fund offerings with similar holdings like infra fund with fin exposure.
3481 2018-03-22 02:34:19 Yes. Please help. Now that Amazon is buying Whole Foods, should I keep both stocks?

3488 2018-03-22 02:31:22 ...heralding your call for a decline into an August low for stocks???...
3489 2018-03-22 02:30:16 Right in sense of ? Cash call or stocks? Based on stocks, i think their stocks have more upside than the market. but i am not sure whether correction will come to deploy the cash as they hold diversified portfolio of 30 stocks.

3501 2018-03-22 02:22:28 STOCK MARKET TODAY:
1) Stocks are at high valuations & investors are complacent
2) Similar to 6/7 market when it dropped 55% ..took 6 years to recover 
RISKS IN MARKET:
1) Trump fires Mueller
2) Trade War with China
3) HUGE US Deficits
REDUCE STOCK HOLDINGS?

3502 2018-03-22 02:21:34 Agreed.  Generally when interest rates rise, bond prices fall and stocks follow bonds.

3508 2018-03-22 02:17:52 It’s really bad when I’m going into these days with only 2 or so stocks on my watchlist when I’m use to having around 8 and those 2 set ups wouldn’t even be worthy normally
3509 2018-03-22 02:17:12 What you tried to imply earlier is that SM owns bighit when they are 0% shareholder of bighit stocks. They ain't getting jack shit of that money other than what that streaming service will make
3510 2018-03-22 02:16:51 FB stocks were on the rise
3511 2018-03-22 02:16:19 You’re full of talking points. You don’t need a bump stock to bump fire. Stocks are irrelevant, they are a fad in the gun community.

Universal background checks are impossible to enforce without a federal registry.

3514 2018-03-22 02:15:57 I didn't start this particular "statistics" battle, but I'm willing to drop it...and I'd certainly discuss the gun deaths issue with anyone willing to address it realistically. For example, I fully support the ban on bump stocks currently working its way through Congress...
3515 2018-03-22 02:15:49 @ZenTrends It also has me worried that 2 stocks continue to make new highs meanwhile the rest are making lower highs
3516 2018-03-22 02:15:38 Good morning

I always buy stocks thinking that
I m buying 'LAND'
3517 2018-03-22 02:14:21 Ughh everybody who invests in that streaming site will get money out of it. Sm and bh have no other connections and sm doesn't own any stocks in bh
3518 2018-03-22 02:14:11 @ZenTrends leading an index worries me. I like to see 70-80% of stocks keeping up with 'leaders.'

and these investigations- real? fake?

IDK if anything can stop FB/TWTR
but these investigations seemed to have spooked FB for some reason

also Zuck is selling ALOT of stocks
in past 30 days

IDK future
3521 2018-03-22 02:12:44 That’s an easy way to blow money lol but you’re also gaining experiences ... so it’s not awful. I would start looking into stocks and bonds and putting more towards your 401k while you can
3522 2018-03-22 02:12:29 if you look into the march the whole purpose of it isn’t to get rid of guns entirely while, some who are attending do believe that the goal for march is to voice that we NEED stricter laws with gaining access to guns & to illegalize semi automatic accessories like bump stocks.
3523 2018-03-22 02:12:25 Isn’t it interesting that Zuckerberg would sell off lg portion of FB stocks 3 months prior to the ‘scandal’? He didn’t sell his shares during the Obama years, did he?
3524 2018-03-22 02:11:54 This is one of my fav tweets ever. I figured that out in 2014. Best stocks ever to trade (with options for me). So much easier to see big money flow moving in and out. Key is to have patience to wait until it reveals itself (instead of overtrading aka my demon). Thx Dan
3525 2018-03-22 02:11:47 @ZenTrends AMZN/NFLX represent 25% of XLY. How would XLY look if you took those two out? I'm still bullish on overall market but two stocks
3526 2018-03-22 02:11:17 Yeah, now that the stocks have tumbled.
3527 2018-03-22 02:10:42 We HAVE background checks
Assault weapons are already banned..have been for quite some time
Bump stocks are nothing more than a part

3531 2018-03-22 02:04:41 Data centres stocks have fallen in the financial markets, due to normal market volatility, but also due to uncertainty around hyperscale cloud demandSteve Wallage from @BroadGroup_Intl Consulting. #DCA18
3532 2018-03-22 02:04:28 Come on, they're banning videos that link to sites that sell bump stocks and guns over the internet. Not just individuals who want to post videos of themselves shooting weapons.
3533 2018-03-22 02:03:43 When I saw jyp ain’t doing that much , it was straight away invalid . Stocks aren’t even open to purchase for BH yet . Supposedly they are going to be open till next year
3534 2018-03-22 02:03:13 If memory serves correctly Leningas promoted/ ramped #PREM for a period last year. It spiked then Leningas went silent moved onto #UKOG. Both companies bargepole stocks.

3540 2018-03-22 02:02:03 For months shorts in $AKAO have enjoyed a situation where there have been many shares available to borrow and the cost was relatively low, 5%, compared to similar high short interest stocks. What happens if the borrow gets pulled or the cost of borrow rises to 50%?
3541 2018-03-22 02:01:54 The way it a get serious, me need to run in pon some FB stocks!
3542 2018-03-22 02:01:41 How can even sm own bh stocks when it's not a public company
3543 2018-03-22 02:00:08 If you are going to call semi-auto rifles or even with bump stocks "assault rifles," won't you have to rename the Dept of Defense the Dept of Assault? Do U know of some rifle suitable only for assault & not defense? Assault rifle is a propaganda term.
3544 2018-03-22 01:59:11 Trump to sign China Tariffs tomorrow at 12:30. If that happens imo market could see a big pull on those stocks that are impacted, which will be a lot. Investors may look to move funds elsewhere.

3546 2018-03-22 01:58:18 Bump stocks do not reach the rapid fire speed of modern military rifles, tho they enable faster firing than normal trigger pulling method. Bump stock still has one trigger pull per bullet. BTW "Assault rifle" is a misnomer for civilian rifles.
3547 2018-03-22 01:57:20 @maddow There mantra should be repeated forever.  Ban assault rifles, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, ban gun shows, extreme background check!

3564 2018-03-22 01:43:32 I am not using the term military style in the weapons discussion. I’m talking about making automatic weapons illegal, banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines and increasing the buying age to 21.
3565 2018-03-22 01:43:18 People aren't putting bump stocks on Glocks......
3566 2018-03-22 01:40:36 I couldn't disagree more but I don't feel like getting into it. I just read When Money Dies for the 2nd time & it goes on about  crazy valuations on stocks, low unemployment, drug use ect ect ect
3567 2018-03-22 01:40:28 Hindi na nakabawi sa stocks. Pota!
3568 2018-03-22 01:40:13 Advice #3 if you don’t know what a balance sheet, income statment or  P/E ratio is... don’t by individual stocks. Mutual funds and ETFS only.
3569 2018-03-22 01:40:05 Exactly that support is why I got in. Also Spheria recently has new money & has been buying stocks aggressively Compared to their other positions such as CAB & CL1, MRM is still only a smallish position for them, so I think they will remain an on market buyer on any weakness.
3570 2018-03-22 01:37:48 Stocks? Bonds? Futures? I just have a 401K.
3571 2018-03-22 01:35:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
3572 2018-03-22 01:32:22 Goodness you said it all! Any team who choses DeShields would be sorry. 2 yrs college & 3rd tier Turkish team? She's 2nd round.
3573 2018-03-22 01:31:30 Which is why we should be requiring universal background checks, banning bump stocks, imposing an age limit of 21 on gun purchases, enforcing a ban on possession of guns by anyone subject to a domestic violence protection order. None of this threatens my gun ownership.
3574 2018-03-22 01:30:54 We have witnessed repeated murders these past mths. None by illegal immigrants. Pass rational gun control measures. Ban bump stocks. Ban military style weapons and ammo magazines. Stop your bull. 2018 Paul. I pray we will be done with your perverse view of the world.
3575 2018-03-22 01:30:46 I keep telling yall to invest in stocks. When I’m rich, don’t ask me how I did it! 
3576 2018-03-22 01:30:06 I don’t believe you anything Mark. Soft words to keep the price of your stocks cuotes up! All is about money.
3577 2018-03-22 01:30:05 my stocks making me big gwap
3578 2018-03-22 01:30:00 It would be like racing slide stocks
3579 2018-03-22 01:28:20 You have the means, motive and opportunity to curb gun violence by passing laws that ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, expand background checks and provide more covered mental health care. STOP wasting precious time. @MarkSanford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott
3580 2018-03-22 01:27:45 iTWEET: #Digitalism is most certainly the new religion & #ism ahead of us! As political parties across the world hit out at one another on  #CambridgeAnalytica, & as #facebook stocks fall, Political parties need to remember: #IsHamamMeinHumSabNangeHain! #India
3581 2018-03-22 01:24:57 I added up all of the 14 times #Zuck sold stocks between 2/15 and 3/14 and it totaled $784,375,740... talk about #InsiderTrading
3582 2018-03-22 01:24:28 Hong Kong premarket up after the FOMC: Hang Seng Index rises 0.51%, HSCEI gains 0.87%. Energy stocks lead, tech suffering.
3583 2018-03-22 01:23:02 Four stocks firms penalised for illegal transactions
3584 2018-03-22 01:21:25 No joke: I talk with Jacob every market day for his thoughts on stocks/market and even though we have different systems I find his various insights invaluable. Not going to find a sharper trader and his results show it. Give him a try.
3585 2018-03-22 01:21:17 If people want their taxes to increase vote Democrat. They already said if they take over majority they will jack up everyone's taxes. So u know that companies will layoff people because of it. It could be another recession if it happens. Stocks would plummet it would be havoc.
3586 2018-03-22 01:20:04 Andrew McCabe authorized perjury investigation into the legality of bump stocks and possibly more concerns about Russia.
3587 2018-03-22 01:19:54 Thoughts and Prayers for Facebook Stocks 
3588 2018-03-22 01:18:39 I don’t think anyone thinks gun violence will stop. 1 less kid dies, it worth it. I don’t want to take away law abiding citizens guns. I want common sense gun laws. Smaller clip sizes, no bump stocks, and much much more stringent background checks.
3589 2018-03-22 01:18:14 Not at 1000% from my estimation they get big up and down swings from penny stocks and I tend to stay around 400-600% level.
3590 2018-03-22 01:18:13 he feels bad until he checks his bank balance and sees $$$ he made by selling his stocks before the s$it hit the fan
3591 2018-03-22 01:17:17 My son’s stocks went down dramatically. 
3592 2018-03-22 01:16:43 Stakeholders suing him now for plummeting stocks
3593 2018-03-22 01:16:33 Yeayy!! Thanks for the pic dear..  
3594 2018-03-22 01:15:40 Americans didn't have access to AR-15s and bump stocks in the 50s. The Ammo they used didn't pulverize internal organs and leave softball sized exit wounds.
3595 2018-03-22 01:14:50 Why would anyone want to buy Fakebook stocks? Who is he selling these stocks to?
3596 2018-03-22 01:14:22 @Official_Markfb  wonder why FB sold sold $600billion in stocks before they plunged? Can you say inside trading
3597 2018-03-22 01:13:53 I like that style. Aggressive while you’re young. I’m almost all in on some risky stocks, stock broker called me crazy. I like real estate more though. Income properties
3598 2018-03-22 01:12:16 NPR is interviewing one of #Facebook's first and largest investors (Elevation Partners) said he's selling out his stocks. #SellFacebook if you got it, #DeleteFacebook if you don't.
3599 2018-03-22 01:12:09 Zuckenberg cannot be voted out by the board as he controls the majority of voting stock. Major indexes such as the Russell 2000 should not include stocks with this ownership structure. Yes, it would also exclude Google but if you want accountability from execs it is necessary. 
3600 2018-03-22 01:10:57 You might want to add Sft they just changed to a lithium play and waiting on JV
3601 2018-03-22 01:10:55 #srilanka  Stocks fell for third straight times and posted their lowest close in eight weeks, investors worries about economic uncertainty led by #Yahapalanay government @Neetwit @CSE_Media @FT_SriLanka @Dailymirror_SL @adaderana @NewsfirstSL @FirstAt9
3602 2018-03-22 01:10:37 yo I fr hope my stocks for Econ are ok
3603 2018-03-22 01:09:40 I have to get a wholeee new stocks 
3604 2018-03-22 01:08:42 The commodities are up, $USD is down. Russell 2000 is showing relative strength. This is fresh liquidity, even though we may see a few sessions more of discounting activity. Nevertheless, stocks are still looking like bottoming for a spring rally. $SPX $RUT $DBC $CRB
3605 2018-03-22 01:08:42 I fully expect twitter stocks will go up for the short term as Suckerberg's Facebook is crapping so bad right now that even Suckerberg is selling his own shares so he  doesn't lose another 4 or five billion $.
3606 2018-03-22 01:08:11 Plunging Stocks Push Net Worths Of Larry Ellison And Facebook Down Several Billion Each
3607 2018-03-22 01:06:57 maybe except my china stocks becos trump is going to slap tariffs LOL
3608 2018-03-22 01:06:34 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX bottom signal probably completing early tomorrow a.m.  I have to mention one alternative scenario, albeit an improbable one, namely the possibility of a top signal completing INSTEAD OF the bottom signal.

3610 2018-03-22 01:04:13 I know how you feel. It was more of an accept that I would probably never be as technical/flashy as I once was and just focused on easy ways to take stocks.
3611 2018-03-22 01:03:25 $PTN  in portfolio by much years!! Key moment is near! Crucial Res. 1,50 then 2,25$.
Play your game!  #Trading #Stocks #HealthCare
3612 2018-03-22 01:03:07 What about bump stocks & military grade semi-automatic rifles?
3613 2018-03-22 01:00:04 Colorado’s senate has legalized bump stocks and made it legal so that people don’t need a concealed weapon permate anymore. 

People are screaming for a change and neglectful office holders are putting us behind. We’re taking steps back.
3614 2018-03-22 00:59:09 He apparently knew this was coming because he dumped his stocks in his own company
3615 2018-03-22 00:58:18 The last one left because she was trading tobacco stocks.
3616 2018-03-22 00:58:04 Did you get the minimum age raised nationally? Did you ban high-velocity weapons like the AR-15? High-capacity magazines? Bump stocks? Nope.
3617 2018-03-22 00:56:24 and you can buy individual penny stocks with no fees!?  I always thought robinhood was like Stash
3618 2018-03-22 00:56:22 I blame bump stocks.
3619 2018-03-22 00:55:57 Kanye ought go guido on people - oops
Noyeah Hallej louder than stocks
Ho
3620 2018-03-22 00:55:03 Apparently the dive of of USD/JPY is not impacting stocks in Japan as much as it usually does - one more disconnection after the next
3621 2018-03-22 00:54:21 I am not pitching stocks to people c'mon.
3622 2018-03-22 00:54:07 Where is the @SEC investigation for potential insider trading?  They sure investigate many other business leaders that run public companies and suspiciously sell stocks.
3623 2018-03-22 00:51:24 Wow.  #GoogleFinance really sucks now.  I can't find anything, and all my stocks are gone...  Time to move on to something else.  First the #Adwords UI and now this...
3624 2018-03-22 00:49:04 If you think bump stocks change the rate of fire of a rifle, then you should do your research on what bump stocks are actually made for.
3625 2018-03-22 00:48:39 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer  love the show, thanks for all the info. Here are my five top stocks.  Nucor, intel, jp morgan, raytheon, netflix. #amidiversified
3626 2018-03-22 00:47:40 We play soon ... not the same as before did u not see me 2 stocks wadis mewtwo and get bodied by his rob
3627 2018-03-22 00:45:41 After a party wins majority control, there is always a push back. Wouldn't call it a shift but a correction like we have in stocks. Americans bought too much GOP and are now selling in favor of Dem stock.
3628 2018-03-22 00:45:22 In 1970 there were 12000 too many fishermen, overfishing our seas which led to declining stocks. All for a resurrection of fishing industry, but it must be sustainable
3629 2018-03-22 00:44:03 We invest in stocks, real estate, education and careers but what about our Family and Children?
3630 2018-03-22 00:43:04 Thanks for the RT of the top 5 NH #stocks @RailRumRunners $ENVA although it hit a new high on Wed it looks like it is still working on its 6 week flat base. Have a super day.
3631 2018-03-22 00:42:36 Hmm upset me? Don't see where you got that lol. Of course bigger companies usually dont plus you really don't have an edge. Market caps under a billion, staying off the NYSE, stocks with low floats get you the better volatility. But sounds like 300% returns dosen't need much help
3632 2018-03-22 00:42:23 Record stocks for the offense industry. 

Killed untold numbers of people. 

Not much else I can think of. Except getting Americans to willingly submit to all kinds of big brother bullshit.
3633 2018-03-22 00:41:32 I hope he goes bankrupt. Facebook is a sham and he’s a sham. Glad people are dumping stocks.
3634 2018-03-22 00:40:47 Raising the legal age to 21, requiring a mandatory three day waiting period, banning of bump stocks...these seem logical and I would think would cost the @NRA minimally in sales. On the other hand, the good press generated would probably bring new members to the @NRA
3635 2018-03-22 00:40:20 Watch net neutrality start, then watch all these companies stocks plummet.
3636 2018-03-22 00:40:17 Two ex-Googlers want to replace your local police station with a drone that only stocks one product per day.
3637 2018-03-22 00:39:57 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3638 2018-03-22 00:38:12 What the hell do people need bump stocks for if not to mass murder people.
3639 2018-03-22 00:36:40 I’m assuming you are referring to bump stocks.  Never used one, no need.  But as with anything, it depends on whose hands have the item and what’s their intent.  AR 15s are one of the least powerful rifles available.  Personally, I prefer the M1A SOCOM 16, you can hunt with it.
3640 2018-03-22 00:36:13 IF FACEBOOK DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG ... WHY IS MARK SELLING HIS STOCKS???????

3641 2018-03-22 00:36:07 Real queer woman hours who’s wearing socks and stocks
3642 2018-03-22 00:35:05 All focus on @realDonaldTrump China tariff announcement 

That is surely set to trigger a trade way and markets will react on sector basis on that.

3650 2018-03-22 00:29:25 Anything on bump stocks, AR15s, universal background checks, mandatory gun licensing etc??
3651 2018-03-22 00:29:24 @GujralAshwani Secondly, even after asking feedback for two months abt keeping/ selling the delivery stocks recommended by U with that time frame or based on change in market situation, there is no response and ur staff seems afraid2 ask/ convey2 U..14/n
3652 2018-03-22 00:27:47 Could you please name some heavily discounted stocks. I think alot are forgetting that opl 226 is a large block. Noa prospects have 237M BO best case. Its been over 3 months ShoreCan has been in the final stage of being granted ministerial consent for the Essar acquisition. Soon.
3653 2018-03-22 00:26:09 you do not  support banning bump stocks or raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle come out  against it
3654 2018-03-22 00:24:45 If you look at the numbers, they all prove the anti gun agenda will do nothing. If all AR15s are destroyed, everyone takes a background check,  all magazines are under 10 rounds, no more bump stocks, someone will just use a shotgun, a different rifle, or pistol.
3655 2018-03-22 00:23:56 i sold some of my stocks so that i can pay for my facial. dont judge.
3656 2018-03-22 00:23:46 lol didn't mean to upset u... I'm trying to learn charts isn't super easy just saying catalysts have a big part too bigger than large stocks that don't fluctuate as much.  If your offering I would love some help.
3657 2018-03-22 00:23:22 Agreed on capping point- still too cheap . Stocks always retreat in raisings. I’m less trusting than I once was - time will tell
3658 2018-03-22 00:23:13 Gldg hit that high but you never state when these stocks have had massive reverse splits. Great it went that high but only because of the reverse split that wiped out stock holders in the process. You only ever show the highlight real of these plays but never the full truth.
3659 2018-03-22 00:22:54 Não é estranho é de outro mundo... De um mundo aonde as bibliotecas têm dinheiro para renovar stocks e compram e vendem livros conforme os leitores... Nos EUA as bibliotecas cuidam-se delas próprias, não é como por cá que vivem á sombra de outros...
3660 2018-03-22 00:22:28 Only on daily time frame, stocks retrace 50% from high of the day to low of previous day all the time for many days in a row .. $SQ $MU Then there's stocks & indices that make significant lows for ex Feb 9 was a significant ST low so take that low & ath & mark those Fib levels..
3661 2018-03-22 00:21:44 I hope they ask....if he DUMPED Stocks in his own CO. a day or days before.......!
3662 2018-03-22 00:21:23 Any organisation has a set of rules the membes agree on.

I for one, don't like CAP, but it is being reformed. CFP is necessary to preserve fish stocks. UK is hypocrit on CFP as it sells its quota to others.
3663 2018-03-22 00:20:51 Scanning stocks tonight. Nothing stands out except energy related names. I haven't traded them in years!
3664 2018-03-22 00:20:29 Bump stocks? Have you seen how people can fire at rapid rates with a belt loop...or just using the rifle’s recoil?

3665 2018-03-22 00:20:23 Stocks are freefalling
3666 2018-03-22 00:19:29 Doug Jones supports:
- closing the gun show loophole 
- banning bump stocks
- a three-day wait to buy a gun
3667 2018-03-22 00:18:13 Key takeaway from Fed meeting - as expected Fed so far still content with only 3 rate rises this year. Good for stocks
3668 2018-03-22 00:16:39 @Nigel_Farage what was the point of wasting good fish by pouring dead fish into the river. Why not give homeless Fish & Chips for lunch? If you wanted to pour fish into the Thames, why not put live fish in so it can boost fish stocks in the river? Today won't change anything.

3684 2018-03-22 00:09:11 I think you are operating on   a set of talking points. We did not say we do not need common sense changes like bump stocks, mag capacity,  age restriction, and mental illness. We do not use a school security crisis to push our agenda sir. So see, you agree with Trump.
