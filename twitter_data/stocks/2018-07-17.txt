That's not what I saw on FBN yesterday.

Hopefully they were wrong.

54 2018-07-17 23:23:47 there's an important economic concept here in that even if a profit is made, a lower profit from the expected outcome is still considered a loss to the people who hold prospective wealth (stocks.) It's called MARR, or Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return.

61 2018-07-17 23:16:23 I would definitely let my dog P on trump. It would be fun to put Trump in the stocks and release a bunch of poorly trained male dogs. We could drink beer eat hotdogs and wager on how many times Donny gets Peed on.

91 2018-07-17 22:57:13 considering that stocks in guns have been slammed over these things, the free market seems to agree and find this plenty rational.

121 2018-07-17 22:39:41 None of the above. Financial independence is when you can rely on your own capital (rather than someone else’s) to pay for your expenses. I.e. when you are no longer a wage earner but rather a business owner (whether via stocks, bonds, real estate, or private equity)
122 2018-07-17 22:39:37 They have never deviated, these dually listed CA/US stocks.

You’re a disaster.
124 2018-07-17 22:34:51 Can we pass a law that racists who harass others like this are forced to be put in stocks and pelted with rotten  fruits and vegetables in the town center? Still wouldn't change them, their hearts are fundamentally rotten to the core.

127 2018-07-17 22:33:41 its because the bank is a “for profit” institution
its trying to gain money so it uses your money and reinvest in it in stocks and such
but when you go negative you used their money without their permission,
so now they want something extra
for what you took from them

137 2018-07-17 22:29:04 Shame we dont still have the stocks
138 2018-07-17 22:28:52 So here is the scam: 
CEO/Corporation institute a massive stock buyback plan, stocks being at all time highs, this props the price up even further. While this is happening the CEOs and other insiders sell off significant portions of their shares making billions of dollars.

140 2018-07-17 22:26:43 Wolf I still have $EMH so hopefully it will eventually bounce. Maybe a news or update from the company will help. Other MJ stocks are still beated down which will not help $EMH
141 2018-07-17 22:25:33 Do you even look at stocks before making comments like this?!

143 2018-07-17 22:24:35 Hi this might sound ignorant, but if the boys were to own stocks, then would the profit that is earned through the trademarks go to the boys?
144 2018-07-17 22:23:08 Who knew Dana traded stocks?    Great!!
145 2018-07-17 22:21:32 Stocks may turn into digital assets themselves to enable them to be traded 7 days a week. Further saving costs in time creating paperwork documents when buying stocks etc !
146 2018-07-17 22:21:16 Stocks good
147 2018-07-17 22:21:10 Ok this is like a general view of what u are saying.

153 2018-07-17 22:13:56 Actually for them it makes sense. They're changing the venue from state to federal jurisdiction.
154 2018-07-17 22:12:50 Didn't you stand against the American people by not seizing the DNC server and not charging Hillary for mishandling of classified information? You know the same charges you had no issue signing off on for lesser people?
155 2018-07-17 22:12:49 I invested a lump WISELY just 14 months ago with no stock brokers ... by putting some in #MutualFunds and some in 5 diff CDN company #stocks .. I've earned 9% ($6,300CDN) compared to just having it in a bank account of just 1-4% #cdnpoli #CDNECON #MONEY

165 2018-07-17 22:09:39 Are you talking about our increasing deficit or over valued stocks, Stagnant wages, increased debt of consumers, and now the trade war and gas prices.
166 2018-07-17 22:09:06 So uhh......Do you trade stocks or cryptos?  I'm more of a crypto guy myself 
167 2018-07-17 22:08:40 Time to rewrite the economics books. Rates hikes used to be bad for stocks. Saying that justifying CPI and PPI figures adter decade of ultra low rates... Trump tweeting, it’s all gone a bit crazy out there.

171 2018-07-17 22:07:47 Hey @davidschneider 
Given that this week is the week when the Jewish community has been put in the stocks by your boy wonder Corbyn, it’s a weird that you have been completely, 100% SILENT on this.
Could it be because you are a cowardly fuckwit?
172 2018-07-17 22:06:34 I couldn't believe noone was buying $HYPR today after the #BTC spike. Do the traders buying $HIVE not realize Hyperblock does twice in EBITDA what they do in Revenue? #HODL #cryptocurrency #stocks
173 2018-07-17 22:06:26 nothing will happen! i have tried since last Friday.... no action at all!
174 2018-07-17 22:06:01 Doesn't it suck that stocks jumped today?  Must be damaging your short position...
175 2018-07-17 22:04:50 How do you place a bid on td? Newbie over here lol
176 2018-07-17 22:04:50 i was watching the whole week to see if someone was willing or has shares to sell at ask! no inside ask at all!
177 2018-07-17 22:04:42 Yeah, me too. People I thought were moral and decent didn’t have any qualms about separating kids from their parents and hauling them all over without keeping good track of them, but hey, their stocks!
You can support Trump but there are times when you need to say this is no good
178 2018-07-17 22:04:37 For someone who is familiar with stocks... Where would you invest $1,000?
179 2018-07-17 22:04:36 Either way I'm gonna grab some w E*TRADE
180 2018-07-17 22:04:19 Be Interested to see the action tomorrow. Td let me place a bid. I wonder if it gets rejected at open or if there is a chill or not.
181 2018-07-17 22:04:05 So pretty my offshore driller friend said there all cashing out oil stocks by the day and fixing to make another big purchase today ! BTC LTC is what there buying
182 2018-07-17 22:03:32 When an election is triggered then you start counting. If you can afford it you can buy in stocks of stationery, printed material etc. Beforehand
183 2018-07-17 22:03:10 you  can only enter your bid to buy shares! might take for ever to get filled! there is no ask to slap and buy!
184 2018-07-17 22:02:58 How capitalistic of You!

No wonder you won't ban bump... Stocks.
185 2018-07-17 22:02:35 The part that really clicked for me this time was focusing on stocks with high, accelerating sales growth. It kept me from getting shaken out of IQ yesterday on the NFLX sympathy crash.
186 2018-07-17 22:02:01 @CNN cnn ran a story, 'CEO's' sellig stocks. I'll tell you the real reason. The Stock Market is going to crash, sooner rather than later because of Trump's policys. REMEMBER, I said this.
187 2018-07-17 22:01:49 I min aktieportfölj 2018 har jag tyvärr också några små och #storaförlorare #losers som gått med #förlust i år - exempel: losing #stocks: Fingerprint - 61,40 % , ClasOhlson -36,18% och Byggmax - 34,73%        De kan #återvända #return
188 2018-07-17 22:01:04 Or I mean how do u place a bid?
189 2018-07-17 22:00:45 I asked on facebook if you trade small cap stocks in your mornING chat room
190 2018-07-17 22:00:01 What do you mean bid?
191 2018-07-17 21:59:48 He didn't commit treason but you just committed sedition...
192 2018-07-17 21:59:06 In my opinion, stocks will be able to be traded as easily as crypto is.

198 2018-07-17 21:54:38 I had a huge revelation about my smash neutral play, I'd been leaning too heavily on shorthops and dash and not enough walk and fulljump, and that overcommitment keeps costing me stocks vs attacks I can see coming in bracket.  Working on shifting between hot & cold more fluidly.

201 2018-07-17 21:51:48 A few stocks with outstanding returns have contributed the biggest % including your favourite VRS though it’s been a trading share for me.
202 2018-07-17 21:51:48 Very similar to your stinger Stocks  Best of luck @IanJamesPoulter - bring it home!

Protect your alpha. 

whatever.
210 2018-07-17 21:46:29 @DLoesch, so many of your fans call you a trader. I'd like to get in on this action, too. What do you trade, stocks?
211 2018-07-17 21:46:16 8 breakouts: $ABR (gap), $CDMO, $SRAX. No penny stocks but given the strong finish I would have expected more qualifying stocks
212 2018-07-17 21:45:38 @stroughtonsmith Are there any improvements with handoff with Marzipan? Like recognizing find my friends or find my iPhone? Maybe even the stocks app?
213 2018-07-17 21:45:25 False. It unequivocally increased the costs of HC. Insurance cos and hospitals are more profitable. Look what happened to hospital stocks the day supreme court upheld ACA. Up 8%-10%. Completely unnecessary
214 2018-07-17 21:43:08 The crypto rally today resulting in higher prices for fraud names like $RIOT and long term donuts like $KODK will create many opportunities to the short side in the comming weeks for the crypto stocks.
215 2018-07-17 21:41:59 Where is my converted #InWith private stocks from #EPGL? My Etrade account still reflects $0.00. What is going on @InWithCorp? It has been over 4 months now. I need answers!!
216 2018-07-17 21:40:54 N.Cavuto,
Every Fox news viewers know that you always project, vivid, at least subtle 'Anti-Trump' messages on every 'stock news' daily, and the stocks most always go down in your, pouty, downcast appearance & froggy verbages. We never see you any excitement or positivity at all!
217 2018-07-17 21:39:56 @jimcramer what do you think @mindbodyonline and @riteaid for stocks??
218 2018-07-17 21:39:40 Experts are expecting low future returns for stocks in the next decade (around 5% nominal instead of the historical 9 to 10%). Since about year 1999, the S&P500 has produced only 5.4% annualized return. So, they're predicting 30 years of substandard stock returns. We'll see.
219 2018-07-17 21:38:55 What is more impressive is that you run 30+ stocks and are getting those excellent returns ... shows you know what you are doing!
220 2018-07-17 21:36:56 Horrible poll...

stock market is souring because of artificially created money inflating the prices of stocks/bonds. It’ll all come crashing down.

It’s the federal reserve doing this, not either president.
221 2018-07-17 21:36:55 Dana, what's your specialty, baseball cards or stocks? lol @BlackNWhiteDood
222 2018-07-17 21:36:14 wondering about capitalist broths and stocks
223 2018-07-17 21:35:10 They say a degree gets you into the“middle” class. How does one capitalize to gain long term financial stability? Max out 401k? Exercise options? Buy bonds and stocks?
224 2018-07-17 21:35:09 It's because you hurt the baby parts selling business. Our stocks have tumbled thanks to your incredible reporting. I still can't believe how many morons/Christians fell for that.
225 2018-07-17 21:34:30 Exactly what is she trading in?  Stocks?  Bonds?  Goods?  

Sorry!  I couldn't let that one slip by.
226 2018-07-17 21:34:04 Not the fairest trade. Stocks are so unbalanced but the company almost always profits so it’s never a loss. You thinking about buying a larger share?

231 2018-07-17 21:33:12 You saw the news yesterday? Study came out saying the technique's destructiveness to DNA had been wildly underestimated, led to ~7% falls in the stocks of three companies associated with it.

240 2018-07-17 21:28:04 5-7 years with $5500 per year growing until retirement. Gotta be at least 100k! Given how my general stocks are doing I think it would be hundreds. Of course there’s luck in that though. Love your advice just so bitter about my lost Roth IRA time!

244 2018-07-17 21:26:20 you most certainly are. #VRS is significantly undervalued right now - I'm sure you'll see why in due course and we'll see a re-rate. 'other grossly overvalued stocks' - ah yes, classic 'EarlofWisdom' you think you know better than everyone else..

269 2018-07-17 21:10:09 I watch the markets every day (over 20 years) so I know all about adjustments and corrections.

270 2018-07-17 21:09:18 So why have I lost so much in stocks since January??????  Idiot.  Find someone who understands the economy to draw pictures for you.

301 2018-07-17 20:59:52 I must correct myself.
When saying the stock market does not affect the general economy, I was thinking of short term fluctuations.
Of course, the larger trends do have significant effect.
My larger point was that the economy drives stocks, not the reverse.
302 2018-07-17 20:59:51 Stocks, commodities or both? You are certainly a busy woman.
303 2018-07-17 20:59:09 I'm staying away from this froth... pitiful low volume and weird pops in stocks... methinks the Fed is buying on the backend again...

329 2018-07-17 20:46:34 The main implication for American style options is that it is possible to play some ex-div games every 3 months (not pure arbitrage but good enough). And also there are ample opportunities with hard to borrow stocks where a synthetic short can get out of hand really quickly.

401 2018-07-17 20:09:25 You would really need to reload to shoot a lot of certain ammo, I just never wanted to get into that, I keep pretty good stocks of ammo I shoot.
402 2018-07-17 20:09:16 But you can budget your risk. These fairy dust stocks? Nah. Like nflx bonds are way superior short than shares.
403 2018-07-17 20:09:02 Tough owning out-of-favor (value) stocks right now...but time is on my side.  Also, $UNH is more interesting, but not there yet

408 2018-07-17 20:06:24 Obama, Michelle & Susan Rice landed at Netflix. Netflix stocks down 14%. Lost a lot of subscribers & new ones aren't signing up?
409 2018-07-17 20:06:20 Was re-reading How To Make Money in stocks - over the weekend,  O'Neal made a similar comment about the backfilling-- we are seeing it on a daily basis now.  From my observation, the 5emas is where stocks are re-testing coming out of this base.  $ROKU was an example yesterday.
410 2018-07-17 20:05:04 The main focus of my courses are options boss if u have small account and trade those kind of stocks learn options we took $RIOT for 400% today. Never get those returns playing stock.
411 2018-07-17 20:04:10 Hi Ron, thanks for your message, I completely understand. Across the region we've had around half the amount of rainfall we’d expect to see between May - June. The dry conditions have challenged our water resources overall. With little rainfall to replenish our stocks ...

417 2018-07-17 20:01:06 It’s a day trader affair. You speculate and make money. But the fundamentals of trading can be applied to any area. I see Commodities as a good space when stocks correct. Crypto is to cash in fast
418 2018-07-17 19:59:17 Au max sous 10 jours, ils ont des pré stocks et les stocks de masse sont en cours

420 2018-07-17 19:58:43 I am afraid crypto currency has no real monetary value except for speculation so I have been reluctant but I see a global correction in stocks coming up soon
421 2018-07-17 19:57:32 $STUDY in early stage of a market rally, your stocks will backfill an retest levels frequently. You want to see the b/o hold on and end of day basis.  Also the 5ema should be a guide.  During a rally, your stocks will test the 10ema or 20ema. you need to hold to make big gains.

How much have you been paid in Russian stocks, you will B the loser. Dialogue is good, sleeping with the enemy is not!
442 2018-07-17 19:47:26  No worries. I had to research it before replying. By default I thought it was based on the order of list within Stocks app. Second try had me look in Watch app settings. Not exactly intuitive.
443 2018-07-17 19:46:59 Bah, il est en baisse de prix à genre 900€ pour faire écouler les stocks avant les prochains, si tu veux l'acheter, c'est l'affaire (c'est le prix d'un 8 Plus)

450 2018-07-17 19:42:22 @realDonaldTrump inflation in the rise. GDP not return dollars expected. Taxes for you and rich buddies.  Companies not increasing wages and jobs. Buying back stocks.  Tariffs will spiral us into recession. Trump family getting richer. Please take economics 101.
451 2018-07-17 19:42:19 And also unless it's honed in a relatively predictable environment - lesson from psychology.
Many day traders insist they can pick the best stocks, yet they underperform S&P 500, because the environment is too unpredictable.
452 2018-07-17 19:42:13 I've never invested in stocks before other than my retirement account with my former employer. I decided to try investing. I bought one share of a stock on the 11th & as of right now I've made a profit of $4.93. Thanks Becky Oberg for the info! — feeling excited
453 2018-07-17 19:41:44 Clear-minded Americans who want peace in the world must stand with our president.  For many, PEACE is a bad word; their stocks will lose value; they will lose money.

464 2018-07-17 19:34:08 Why are these asshats so eager for war? Did Bill Kristol persuade them all to buy the same defense company stocks?

472 2018-07-17 19:29:39 Powell does not seem to be too concerned about tariff wars at this juncture. I expect, for the time being, a continued upward bias to stocks largely due to earnings, but also helped by this positive view of the economy. (5/6)
473 2018-07-17 19:29:20 Anything mining related goes down every day. Uranium stocks are not going up with ura rebalancing.

503 2018-07-17 19:12:21 I actually learned about stocks mostly from grad school... And everything else I learned in life, like with cars, was on my own. You say we need to give our parental figures credit, which is true, but you also need to be your own person in life. Be your own resource.

531 2018-07-17 19:00:05 Great letter!! Have you done a similar analysis of Growth vs. Value for 1990-2000 time period. The point I am trying to understand is whether the much slower Holding EPS growth of Value stocks recurring over history or is the current time period unique
532 2018-07-17 19:00:03 I said this over two years ago. The government should hire Big Four Accounting firms to audit the roles and the systems and procedures. 

If public corporations were this sloppy their stocks would never be allowed to trade.
533 2018-07-17 19:00:00 Oh, yeah, its really that simple. RIOT is blockchain, which is related to Bitcoin. DPW also another stock that sells Bitcoin mining equipment also rips when Bitcoin rally's. Back in November all these stocks were going nuts.
534 2018-07-17 18:59:32 Somebody teach me a lil sum about stocks Im trying to get it going..
535 2018-07-17 18:54:32 Lets grow up and not shut down healthy debate and freespeech by calling everyone with a different opinion a racist. Steve Bannon will not be spewing hate speech.  I would rather hear about stocks personally.
536 2018-07-17 18:54:16 So the @NRA launders money for Russians? Nothing wrong with doing that as long as you get to keep your assault rifles and bump stocks right @DLoesch?
537 2018-07-17 18:53:59 Okay, seeing the way nifty moving contrary to other stocks, I might be wrong but these kind of one sided move do result in gap down.
538 2018-07-17 18:53:01 AG markets: last time wheat stocks in Russia, Ukraine, Australia & Europe as low as USDA pegged last thursday was back in 2007. In 2007, KC wheat bottomed March $4.33, in December hit $10.30. In February ‘08, market peaked $13.80 or so. Food for thoughts

573 2018-07-17 18:39:04 Starting weights matter too. Hence outperformance won’t be stellar. I meant those stocks would look same as Index but most funds are having quite high active share. You may check @MoneyWorks4ME

578 2018-07-17 18:36:09 When $btc and $spy up big it means speculative pumping and short squeezing. Look for stocks with high short float and those with stunning pumping history like FAANG. The trend is robust and it's moving fast. It also means it's short-lived and usually ends with a big ugly crash.

581 2018-07-17 18:35:03 Just remember I told you to buy bitcoin while the market is down, while yall recommended to buy more stocks...in 2 years you could be up 10x. Probably more to be honest.  And if you learn how to invest into altcoins you can make much more than that.  Retire early.  Fuck stocks.
582 2018-07-17 18:34:45 Today's Democrat. Banks. War. Racialism to Preserve Racism. Prison and Riot Gear Stocks.  (See Republicans..)
583 2018-07-17 18:33:44 Also stagnant wages so I question the quality of the jobs, tax handouts leading to companies buying back their own stocks inflating stock prices artificially. And the topic is Trump's actions, why do people drag Hillary in for some reason, she isn't president!

They will lose more than half their market, their stocks will plummet, we'll buy it at it's new low, obtain seats on the board & take over.

666 2018-07-17 18:00:35 All of our economy over the last 200+ yrs,  you can't say it's stronger than ever & while yes my stocks are doing ok (just ok), i'm not worried about any imminent (like today/tomorrow) damage, i know his trade war will have fall out, just praying not like '08 where we lost a lot.

672 2018-07-17 17:59:35 You know whats funny, last time a journalist for bio tech stocks told me that, $ARDM dropped from $7 to $1.  His assumptions were based off speculation as well.  Good luck to you on $ARWR hope you sell before it falls.

679 2018-07-17 17:58:30 am i understanding this correctly when i say that this is similar to what we saw from @Jesse_Livermore -- their study highlighted that momentum stocks become glamor stocks in about 12 months...goes from growth done right..to expensive?
680 2018-07-17 17:58:16 Today is proof positive that we no longer have a market. After one of the top 3 stocks takes a dump on poor earnings, we gap down and move to new ATH. No way in a rational world. People should be dumping AMZN, AAPL, etc. like crazy pre earnings b/c it will be the same.

686 2018-07-17 17:55:17 $AMRN I’m new to $AMRN, just bought some stocks today. I read that till the end of Q3 results will be presented. Is $AMRN a good investment?
687 2018-07-17 17:54:46 1. Fight the first impression - Constantly remind urself u r unaware of ur first impression almost always.
We develop this intuition over time to identify Danger not Stocks.
688 2018-07-17 17:54:26 Ridiculous. Large corporations buying back their own stocks did not create jobs.
689 2018-07-17 17:54:10 Been working on my timing and so far so good on $ABEV and $SA positions. I will be targeting sectors with the most potential and then stocks within those sectors. Ramping up public buys again so I can show off my new stuff :)
690 2018-07-17 17:54:01 We are allocating the cash from precious metals sales into U.S. Stocks, widely diversified across sectors, industries, large, medium and small cap, both growth and value. Our canary in the coal mine NASDAQ 100, has re-established new highs. Would like to see Dow and S&P hit highs
691 2018-07-17 17:53:41 It’s simple for newbies (like me), can be automated, easily tracked, and you can buy into individual or groups of stocks.
692 2018-07-17 17:53:28 To be honest I'm not sure I understand the point you are trying to make here?  Maybe I'm just not reading your post correctly.  But what exactly do you mean that bond market leads equity market.  That when bonds rally so will stocks?
693 2018-07-17 17:52:51 Yeah, yeah the Dow is up, but if you stripped out the 22 out of 30 stocks in the index that are up on the day, it would be down.

700 2018-07-17 17:50:00 The second part of my tweet shows that there is a demand as well as a value.  Also, they are tradeable assets and legal tender in multiple countries now.  I get the point your making, but the entire crypto-space is still very much in a bubble.  Tech stocks used to be volatile too

709 2018-07-17 17:46:02 People with guns kill people. There is absolutely no need for a high powered gun. No need for magazine clips to hold 20 bullets. No need for bump stocks so it can fire like an automatic weapon. Absolutely no need. There is a need to have stricter laws and waiting periods.

711 2018-07-17 17:44:40 Looking at stocks and groups lots of countries under 'migrant' heading gives misleading impression. eg an archetypical corner shop might change from Rosenblatt's, to Chan's to Patel, to Makulski, to Popescu to Tesco's Metro. Need to facilitate flows not look at changes in stocks.
712 2018-07-17 17:44:25 load the boat on #crypto and #blockchain stocks!!!!! Only been on this for the last 2 weeks that this was coming!!!!
713 2018-07-17 17:44:13 Yeah if you don’t know stocks and the market well, do a CD and start learning about the market, because you’re in the market with your 401k, so it’s always good to be up on things homie! Any other questions feel free to hmu
714 2018-07-17 17:44:11 This is true, but I’m gonna get some of the profit. They coming anyway you see it. Buying more of they stocks today . Still team @donkeycoffee as far as who you should buy from locally.
715 2018-07-17 17:42:54 that sounds good . i just don't know nothing about stocks i've never messed with them i look at it as gambling lol and i don't gamble. the CD is definitely something that sounds great 
716 2018-07-17 17:42:30 Netflix getting pounded in the market now! Wait! Subscriber drop? Explanation? Thousands of MAGAs cancelled because NFLX went left? Hired the Obamas and others of his administration? Blue wave? Time will tell. The mighty have fallen! Adios FANG stocks?
717 2018-07-17 17:41:49 Brilliant. Can you tell me, is the bond market on a 15min or even daily timeframe a reliable indicator to determine direction of money flows into stocks; if the bond market is bought up and yields drop, will money flow into stocks? If so why exactly is this?
718 2018-07-17 17:41:30 @netflix you’re going to tank for being liberal propaganda. Bye bye “ you do see your Stocks and value are crashing right ? “
719 2018-07-17 17:41:24 Ridiculous argument. Why have mutual funds, why ETF's, why futures? All the financial vehicles for stocks, bonds, and commodities will be made for digital assets. Furthermore, some stocks will morph into tokens to take advantage of the 24/7 functionality. Learn or be left behind.
720 2018-07-17 17:40:44 If I don't think true full auto weapons should be banned then why would I think bump stocks should be banned?
721 2018-07-17 17:40:31 In s related story the NRA will be suing the victims as well for limiting 2nd Amendment rights to bump stocks for gun owners.
722 2018-07-17 17:40:17 Facebook and netflix -best companies to buy stocks atm cuz it's both constantly rising
723 2018-07-17 17:40:06 And bump stocks do not "make a gun full auto". At best they simulate it. You still have to keep pulling the trigger. And no, I don't think they should be banned
724 2018-07-17 17:39:48 Yep. Puffins doing brilliantly at Skomer, but struggling at other locations badly such as Shetland!
Probably something to do with the fish stocks having some protection as the surrounding sea is a Marine Reserve. 
725 2018-07-17 17:38:08 Do you think Amazon stocks will keep rising in the long run? They've been going up in value like crazy this past year I'm starting to wonder if it's sustainable.

727 2018-07-17 17:37:10 And don't play semantics. You know "gun show" loophole means private sales/internet sales, which do NOT always require background checks. And w/easily obtainable/makable bump stocks any gun can be fully auto. Do you agree w/getting rid of bump stocks?

738 2018-07-17 17:30:22 even if they have both, most RH users are going to be transferring stocks to crypto, so shouldn't we still consider that new money?
739 2018-07-17 17:30:15 “Proponents argue that the stocks or bonds with higher ESG scores will also see better long-term performance relative to benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 SPX+0.43%.” #news #Marketwatch
740 2018-07-17 17:29:36 1/3 of American stocks are held by foreigners.  The implications of that need to be pondered and made explicit.  The GOP platform masquerades as Americanism, but it is really the party of self-interest, selling out America, and hiding/protecting corruption.  FOX is propaganda.

752 2018-07-17 17:22:17 Tracking is hardly labor intensive. I think you need to be running like $1,000 to get what used to be prime broker level service. I assume all private placements are going to $0 and add up the P&L.

803 2018-07-17 16:54:26 So after you have your watchlist narrowed how many stocks would you be willing to watch to make moves on and do you just watch level 2 when you are in more than one trade at anytime? Do you look to another screen for each trade or have all tape and level 2 beside eachother?

805 2018-07-17 16:53:58 as stocks continue to make all-time highs and gold keeps making new lows, it's important to think back at all the gold bugs preaching inflation and deflation and various other 'flations' to justify owning this garbage the past 7 years. it's been a losers trade
806 2018-07-17 16:51:13 Mercers, Adelsons, Kochs.  They need to get chased out of restaurants, have companies & offices occupied, public protests wherever they turn up.

819 2018-07-17 16:46:24 U.S.Stocks rose in morning trading, recovering from an earlier decline after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the U.S. central bank wouldn’t move too quickly in changing monetary policy, and that it would be flexible in the face of changing conditions.

It's money we need for the full recapitalization, later the value of the stocks would depend only on future profits.
844 2018-07-17 16:34:34 First of all thank you for your appreciation. Since I was low on cash I had to churn to move to higher conviction picks. Some stocks that I owned did not fall much but valuations are Sky high. More like opp cost. AR or mgt commentary was another factor

1: Invest in the right stocks.

2: Put it in a piggy bank, savings account, or somewhere you won't easily be tempted to spend it.

3: Don't spend it, and if you do, spend it on very cheap things.

902 2018-07-17 16:03:41 A big problem with this discussion is a difference in meaning of term "value" as used by quant style analysts and value in a Ben Graham, Buffett sense. The latter is idiosyncratic and judged bottom up by company not just a low metric ranking in the entire universe of stocks.
903 2018-07-17 16:02:22 IBD50 has great stocks to trade on the long side. With strong growth fundamentals & increasing relative strength, they usually have a solid bid underneath them on pullbacks.

That being said, don't trade them like IBD recommends. Too many do that  & get inconsistent results.

' $CVX remains technically stronger than $XOM'.

1053 2018-07-17 15:07:32 Finally found a local grocery that stocks Brisk (Lemon) in cans -- I buy all of them every time I'm there (there's rarely any left) and then begin the vigil again. 

Again, guys; **please** consider selling in gallon jugs in the tea aisle as well.

1314 2018-07-17 13:20:18 Sanders clearly understands how to hide his wealthy in low taxed entities like property and stocks. Maybe he got his bank defrauding college bankrupting wife to cook, I mean, do his books. It would explain why his scampaign went broke.
1315 2018-07-17 13:20:17 Great short.
1316 2018-07-17 13:20:11 I was told I would die from the tax cuts, net neutrality, bump stocks and the Paris accords, so this was nothing.

1320 2018-07-17 13:19:10 Bought starter positions in OKTA, DOCU, AAOI and AMD yesterday after coming back from a holiday.  Leading stocks are generally holding up, but there's also a few warning signs (b/o failing mainly). Will limit further exposure and tighten stops until I see further conviction.

1324 2018-07-17 13:17:36 This is something people forget - the "market" is a gaggle of mid 20s, not married analysts  working 100 hour weeks some with drug habits. Even if that were not the case how do you evaluate the impact of a mutant grapefruit and treason on stocks?

1369 2018-07-17 12:55:46 No over the long term ETF are safest and cost efficient. Buffett had challenged against some of the top MF mgrs that ETF will beat all MF and he did beat them. So that 1 or 2% cost in MF will eventually be its downfall. So invest in ETF or direct stocks if you are knowledgeable.
1370 2018-07-17 12:54:19 Ummm I don’t like lambos. However I like safe secure stocks. B/c companies can never go out of business and/or have challenges. You best stick with those. Crypto is too unsafe!!

1379 2018-07-17 12:50:47 True, the stock market is up significantly. However, that only creates wealth for the minority of Americans who own stocks. Plus, while market is up 26%, it was up 33% during same period of #Obama.
GDP was up only 2% last quarter; but overall it is up.
Unemployment is down...

1389 2018-07-17 12:46:38 And even counting his stock based compensation, he is one of the lowest paid CEOs. His majority of net worth isn't liquid, it depends upon how the company's​ stocks suffer. 
That being said, it is true however that the blue collar amazon employees are paid less.
1390 2018-07-17 12:46:14 Issa - money in a 401k is invested in stocks and they’re suggesting that sooner or later the market will crash and the stocks will be worthless and never recover. Of course, if you aren’t in the market, you don’t see the 10-15% yearly gains before the crash.
1391 2018-07-17 12:45:10 sometimes i wonder if certain chatrooms have relationships with promoters to pump certain company's stocks for them to sell paper/liquidate.

(for example, CALI ran huge yesterday then tanked and today we find out all their executives have resigned amidst a police investigation)

1436 2018-07-17 12:19:10 Bernie Sanders is in the 28% tax bracket but pays a mere 13% tax rate. That’s because he hides his wealth in low tax entities like property and stocks. When he pays his fair share of taxes, he can whine about the wealthy.

1458 2018-07-17 12:04:58 If you have any experience in trading stocks, then you are keenly aware of the largest fault in liquidated traders - admitting they are wrong and cutting loses before it's too late. Stop lying to yourselves people.
1459 2018-07-17 12:04:09 Our long-term readings suggest the bull market is still alive, but we are late stage. In the beginning of a new bull market you should "invest" buying and holding the strongest stocks for large moves. In the later stages, you should switch to "trader" nailing down decent profits.

1465 2018-07-17 11:57:35 What I mean by that, is that my theory of the stock markets looking terrible could probably be confirmed in the coming weeks, when we see that the earnings are not that positive as everybody expects.

Stocks like $AAPL, $VZ, $MSFT, $FB are all eager to fall down, so is the index.
1466 2018-07-17 11:56:33 Some stocks are given the benefit of the doubt over and over. Others go down no matter what. Recognize this in your holdings. Easy > Hard

1486 2018-07-17 11:47:28 (1/2) I'm already seeing commentary about how each #FAANG stock is different and how you can't compare $NFLX to $FB to $AMZN and so on. And TECHNICALLY that's true. But when everyone owns the same handful of stocks & ignores all the safer, better, higher-rated stocks, guess what?

1564 2018-07-17 10:37:14 Sanders is a broken record. The irony is he is now a millionaire, thanks to scamming his minions, and he pays half the tax rate he should because he hides wealth in low taxed entities like property and stocks.

1570 2018-07-17 10:31:19 Something I’ve been trying out a bit more is to have similar stocks in same sector on watch when looking to enter a trade. More often than not, money is moving in or out of a sector at same time so it gives you a feel for how your stock is moving in relation to sector money flow

1607 2018-07-17 10:02:59 This all depends on how you define inflation. There's is a lot of inflation not taken into account. Real Estate/Health/Education/Stocks/Taxes.

1845 2018-07-17 06:44:33 Honestly not sure, it was the public shaming that took the biscuit. That's fruiting in the stocks behaviour.
1846 2018-07-17 06:43:54 When the Gov. has stocks, they are an asset. not debt.Harper did not sell debt he sold stocks. Is this a hard thing for you to grasp ?
1847 2018-07-17 06:39:47 Long enough to know the difference between Stocks and Bonds ... You ?
Long enough to know selling high yield stocks is a stupid choice. You ?
1848 2018-07-17 06:39:00 I don’t blame people selling as the falling this time is prolonged, it’s carrying on and on. Whoever sold even last month is away laughing. When recovery happens, not everything will rise, some stocks may never recover or probably give returns better than banks fd.
1849 2018-07-17 06:38:22 @SEBI_India should penalize them for rollback.
1850 2018-07-17 06:37:29 #Insight - most people don’t realise that the BEAR MARKET started in January! If you exclude the FANG stocks then all indicies and sectors are NEGATIVE for the year 2018. Investors are delusional in believing that they can hide from the BEAR MARKET in the FANG stocks..!
1851 2018-07-17 06:37:13 Governments sell their debt in the form of bonds. The $1.4t in federal debt (not $15t) we were discussing is a pile of government bonds.
The stake in GM that the gov't bought then sold to G.Sachs ("high yield stocks") are equity.

1877 2018-07-17 06:11:12 Past corrections whether it’s 2008/ or 11/13/15 Nifty had corrected and stocks corrected a lot more 

This time the predicament is many stocks have fallen like 30-40%. 

But Nifty hasn’t

Question is whether this is a new trend or will Nifty also correct sending stocks down again
1878 2018-07-17 06:11:06 I think it’s being manipulated to invest only in 5-7 stocks and once they bcm terribly high priced( already are!)- they will sell off leaving everyone crashed...

This GIF expression IMO is better saved for tomorrow. I have uploaded a chart analysis. Stocks are in trading ranges MORE than they are in trends, even though a range & a trend can exist at the same time. Reversal on its way! 
1921 2018-07-17 05:38:12 Time to collect quality stocks at low prices
1922 2018-07-17 05:38:07 Yup, my stomach is getting stronger as each day goes by owning stocks like nvda, mu, sq, twtr, tsla. LoL
1923 2018-07-17 05:37:38 Even if a fund starts with equal weight-age with say 20 stocks, HDFC Bank will keep going up and other may be trying to catch up. Hence, HDFC Bank will always be on top, unless they figure out another winning horse!!!

1928 2018-07-17 05:33:24 Exactly. Most companies are story stocks; they're great to trade and use as an instrument to risk X to make Y etc, but when investing with the possibility of averaging down it's best to know who and what you're dealing with. It's your fault (and your money) when it goes wrong.

1931 2018-07-17 05:32:29 It's all survivorship bias....if we look from same angle, many low PE stocks like Caplin point, Avanti etc. gave 100x returns also....so it's more of stock picking rather than valuation entry point...
1932 2018-07-17 05:30:10 Would love to say a big well done to the @ASX for the sophisticated algorithms and techniques used in order to catch the very hard to find stocks like $DCC going up around 40% on massive volume, and classifying it as within normal trading ranges, a job well done!

1938 2018-07-17 05:22:56 Las Vegas should have taken the lead on banning bump stocks. @AdamLaxalt is a POS & poor excuse for an AG and now running for Governor. @SteveSisolak has my vote.
1939 2018-07-17 05:22:39 They already have many regulations at their disposal like putting stocks in trade to trade and then they had started some X or S group which allows trading only on Monday’s. they never look at impact of regulation on small investor whom they are supposed to protect
1940 2018-07-17 05:22:23 Morning, even though we've had some welcome rain recently, we still need these temporary restrictions. We estimate some parts of our region need a good few weeks of rain before we can be confident we have the reservoir stocks we need to see us through the summer. Thanks, Caroline
1941 2018-07-17 05:22:20 short selling 101: you know that thing airlines do when they "oversell" seats? ever wonder why? the basic transaction is identical to short-selling stocks and it makes money in the same way. (I've got time to ponder such things on this long transatlantic flight )

1944 2018-07-17 05:19:21 #GenocideByFDA has been my hashtag for quite a while.. But this began during Obama administration.  Ive researched alot on who these MAT pharma are backing.....  Scott had to pull out his big Pharma stocks worth millioms to get his cushy FDA job.
1945 2018-07-17 05:18:54 Agreed sir. But it can looked at level@playing assets for those having stocks or esops... and above all it can be customised also. Having said that, yes it’s not a retail product. For retail investor, mf sip/ stp is the right way
1946 2018-07-17 05:18:24 Now these days some of the fund houses are running focused 25-30 stocks portfolio in MF also. Retail investors can also participate in them without having any threshold limit. But for this you need high conviction & appetite.
1947 2018-07-17 05:17:53 Lend your stocks to shorts or violate and terms of service and you longer get extra stock as dividends while the company stays unprofitable due to massive rapid expansion in 3 dimensions around the factory space. More tents, more layers underground, more lines every month.

1951 2018-07-17 05:17:18 Wouldnt the natural play for institutional Wall Street investors be to shift their focus to crypto when housing and stocks turn bearish??? So one may assume a lot of big money is getting ready to dive into the market eventually.

2061 2018-07-17 03:52:16 Although many stocks may have good value, in a liquidity crisis driven by fear that all becomes irrelevant. #FANGMAN is where the herd is gathered looking for green pasture, but it's going to be a derivative bloodbath.

My quasi-educated guess is that the global fiat financial bubble implodes- deflating both bonds & stocks while the dollar skyrockets as a key of financial system distress. Authorities then lock down & reset the global financial system.

2078 2018-07-17 03:40:04 #MoneyMonday Tip: A “balanced” mutual fund is one that includes both stocks and bonds…also sometimes called a “hybrid” or “blended” fund. Now you can call yourself a financial smarty-pants!

2081 2018-07-17 03:35:12 1 hour! I was looking at my screen for an hour and nothing was happening. The moment I step out to cook that's when my stocks go boom boom. Why...just why???
2082 2018-07-17 03:34:56 yesterday i logged into my neopets account for the first time in a few months and my stocks had increased in value over 500%  move over wall street
2083 2018-07-17 03:34:15 So you are admitting that you don’t know squat about Sanders and his sugar daddies. Btw, Sanders is full of shit which is why he didn’t release his full tax returns. If he did, we would have found out how he cut his tax bill in half. Here’s a hint, investing in property & stocks
2084 2018-07-17 03:34:11 So you change the laws to take stocks into account. Forbid compensation in pure stock. You are pretending like you'd just graft maximum wage laws onto the existing system and everything would magically fix itself. Like anything works like that.
2085 2018-07-17 03:33:21 Anyways as usual following the fall of stock price, in few weeks Tesla will announce something n stocks will skyrocket n the cave diver will soon be forgottenwhile Elon will remain an Icon

2087 2018-07-17 03:31:03 BTC. Cash loses value every year due to inflation. Tech stocks have turned their consumers into cash cows by data farming. Land is not really yours, you're leasing it since you have to pay property tax.
2088 2018-07-17 03:30:19 Well guys I’m talking to people about buying stocks. I’m officially an adult
2089 2018-07-17 03:28:44 Big question for a tweet! Stocks have both higher return (100% of the time) and lower risk of running out of money than bonds. The few times stocks ran out of money in history, bonds always ran out of money far sooner. Compare the graphs.

2170 2018-07-17 02:38:52 Once again @TurnbullMalcolm, @LNPQLD @LiberalAus demonstrated that not only are they liars, they are also criminals who have corrupted the law and exempted themselves from the law.

2171 2018-07-17 02:38:05 What metrics are you using? The stock market? 52% of Americans do not own any stocks. The unemployment rate? Over 100M working age people are not employed. The average American household is 2 paychecks from bankruptcy. You understand the economy as much as your moronic president

2173 2018-07-17 02:35:01 Families have killed for less. I won’t believe he considers them as family unless he gives them the stocks they rightfully deserve.

2174 2018-07-17 02:34:49 I got caught up in the RS. Plus my IB broker would not fill my orders when I needed because of the massive BTC volatility. I lost on that stock.

Every GOP bastard who colluded in this SHOULD BE JAILED FOR LIFE & hauled out every Fourth of July to do time in the stocks (YES, real stocks) on the mall in DC
2291 2018-07-17 01:25:16 One day is also ok. Basically stocks need to exit your demat account. So don't do the same day :)

2298 2018-07-17 01:21:33 $NFLX is down big in after hours and dragging down the rest of big tech. That’s a big decline for most stocks but considering it was up over 100% already this year, not a big deal. If you’ve been waiting to buy into $NFLX, tomorrow you’re gonna get a discount. Could get a DCB.

How do you like @1Brokercom so far ?

Markets seem good, hope they continue adding more stocks on there though.
2306 2018-07-17 01:13:35 As an Investor it means a whole lot, based on the potential correlation to stocks yes an ETF is a major deal for cryptocurrencies that affects more than just America, there are ETF's all around the world looking to tap into Bitcoin
2307 2018-07-17 01:12:54 Well it's very strategy based. As an example, we'd just send in Vash on you. Gain of 2-3 stocks. Even if you used Iota on me, our sets go game 3 last hit. 

Our team has more explosive characters (Fox, Bayo, Ryu). Me/Dex play the long game, but Marth/Lucina can be just as jank.

2309 2018-07-17 01:12:12 1/2 Disregard what I said earlier everyone...I WILL NOT BE GOING LONG. It gives me too much bias and until my data proves me wrong i will stay short biased. For every 4 stocks that pop and drop its MAYBE 1 that drops. I will though ise my data for its intended purpose...

2315 2018-07-17 01:06:29 Eh, if you think 2% is a lot, you've never owned startup stocks before. I think Wayfair's biggest single day drop while I worked there was over 10%.

It's an inexact science
2332 2018-07-17 00:52:24 I didn’t own it as an individual stock but one of the biggest fades on the entire internet, who has been bearish all FAANG stocks on the way up, and bearish $AMZN since 1999 or earlier, just tweeted something negative about $NFLX so it probably will bounce.
2333 2018-07-17 00:49:01 If all this is just for Roman to get his win back vs Lashley they've lost it... but hey stocks up. #raw
2334 2018-07-17 00:47:26 @Target puts out a digital coupon for $20 off purchase, people get it, save it and trek 40 minutes to the target only to get there and have them tell you corporate cancelled the coupon. Some customer service. Fuck off Target. Here’s to your stocks and projections tanking.

2338 2018-07-17 00:43:46 A. What were your English grades in High School? Nowhere did she celebrate kids being gunned down. B. DO you really want to go back to medieval times, where someone can be thrown in the stocks and publicly flogged for the smallest of transgressions? Sounds like it.
2339 2018-07-17 00:43:45 but everyone said EM was a sure thing 6 months ago, was different this time, larger % of tech stocks, etc.  what happened to all that?

2344 2018-07-17 00:37:51 Why would i get in trouble for pumping stocks? I don't (as you know) You linked to something when I was in college and 20 years old. I'm confused? Blocked for stupidity, next time do research.
2345 2018-07-17 00:37:51 I did ask my urologist if she thought that the $NFLX fiasco would affect the other $NYFANG / #FANG ish stocks. She looked at me blankly and snapped on those latex gloves. $SPX $NDX $IWM
2346 2018-07-17 00:36:45 oh, no! Defense stocks will get hurt.
2347 2018-07-17 00:34:56 #Netflix $nflx #stocks is in trouble. Content makers are aware of its danger. #Disney #DIS & #Viacom will give it less content or make their own streams tops. Amazon & Apple are in the game too. It's not making money, just spending.

@business @cnbc @msnbc @CNNMoney @ft @forbes
2348 2018-07-17 00:34:36 $nflx Investors are adding here. The 50 day MA is still at $369.61 or 7.5% lower from here. Stocks like $NFLX have metrics like subscribers that count more than anything else when earnings come around and were 15% short on the numbers today. Tomorrow we see a retracement. (2)
2349 2018-07-17 00:33:26 Should find a better candidate these 2 are LOSERS I think bad for Stocks
2350 2018-07-17 00:33:14 All hyper growth stocks eventually get valued on real metrics, it may not be now or soon but someday $NFLX
2351 2018-07-17 00:32:26 Good grief there is no shame at Fox News. This guy should be put in stocks outside the news station.
2352 2018-07-17 00:32:20 You were around the last time 5 stocks were responsible for almost all of the index gains.
2353 2018-07-17 00:31:45 The company that owns a major stake in @MoviePass had another big dip in their stocks today, that company is being charged with defrauding investors in India.  My wife, also, cannot log into her movie pass account and the password reset form is no longer working. #getout
2354 2018-07-17 00:30:53 He sold his stocks in the company & donated money to the foundation before Hillary became Secretary of State. So he had no personal interest or gain in the sale of company and Hillary wasn't in a seat of power to "bribe".

2357 2018-07-17 00:27:24 also props for bringing a little perspective—

Josh (paraphrased): let’s take a moment to note the major political event we can never unwatch  , that may also have implications for all stocks since US credibility in jeopardy.

One beat. 

Someone else: Ok now WFC earnings...
2358 2018-07-17 00:25:35 Bonds: Global bond market risk increased to 21% (last week: 17%)
Stocks: The global stock market risk index increased to 49% (last week: 47%).
US Dollar risk at US market close was at 8% (positive level).
2359 2018-07-17 00:25:24 That's just one of the painful ones I think about every single day when I check stocks. I also wish I had put $100k in @Tesla in 2012 instead of spending it on one of their first production Model S.

2361 2018-07-17 00:22:36 The outrage from the left is so funny to watch since we never witnessed the Pavlov’s dog experiment first hand but it’s quite fun to watch. If they told them to sell their stocks the markets crashing...guaranteed they would do it without even checking.
2362 2018-07-17 00:21:39 POTUS has done some great things & loves America. Today was a crippling show of weakness for America; our enemies & allies will test us, the GOP Mid-Terms are hurt, Many nation's impacted or endangered Europe, KN/UA/SYIZ/AF/HOA/PK/IR & more, stocks likely to plunge. For starters.
2363 2018-07-17 00:21:29 I have all four of these stocks and have made money on them. Thanks Jim !

2365 2018-07-17 00:19:54 Have you fun now phuck face...it will change soon...go pimp you scam .0001 stocks that go to NO BID and HAVE RS, etc....pos liar.
2366 2018-07-17 00:19:29 Coming up with huge exaggerations doesn't make your case.
I'm not taking a loss because of Trump, its the opposite. I've gained plenty in a better job market, stocks increasing, and tax cuts.
2367 2018-07-17 00:18:55 He's allowing the businesses to thrive. They got huge tax cuts, bought back their stocks, and are now increasing their prices. So they won two-fold. But, once again the middle class will suffer the trickle-down effect. Btw...unemployment had been decreasing every year since PBO

2370 2018-07-17 00:15:21 It will prove to be the biggest scam of all time.  Pumping the cap weighted stocks to drive the indexes higher, in passive funds.  Using CB counterfeit money.  $NFLX down 25% in  week.
2371 2018-07-17 00:15:16 When people think investments, automatically think of car, house, stocks, bonds etc. You forget the single most important investment of all time. Yourself :)
2372 2018-07-17 00:15:10 Euro stocks were mixed Mon, mining shares weaking, bank stocks advanced. Deutsche Bank surged 7.3% following its forecast that profit would surpass consensus expectations in the second quarter, while Total lost 1.0% as the oil price slumped, Glencore dropped 1.3% & BHP lost 2.5%
2373 2018-07-17 00:14:31 Stop it with the pool.  If we wanted to pay people a just wage, he could.  Yes, stocks aren’t fully liquid.  When you have gajillions, YOU CAN MAKE THE WATER.
2374 2018-07-17 00:14:14 Energy stocks were hurt by a 4.4% dive in the Brent crude price as @ConocoPhillips slumped 2.0%, @Occidental sank 1.3%, and @ExxonMobil and Schlumberger both slid 1.0%.
2375 2018-07-17 00:14:07 I’m going to invest in stocks and other businesses
2376 2018-07-17 00:13:30 US stocks were mixed on Monday as the Dow Jones Industrials bucked the trend of an otherwise downbeat session with economic data and a fresh round of results failing to stoke buying appetite.
2377 2018-07-17 00:10:53 Stewie, what were the other 6 stocks you "recently viewed"? Just curious..
2378 2018-07-17 00:10:40 Biological diversity has been decimated, fish stocks are on the verge of collapse, widespread extinction, the Great Barrier Reef bleached out, only 4% pre-man mammals left on earth, the rest are pets and livestock...and you think we can stay closed off from the World

2381 2018-07-17 00:09:02 Stocks don’t feed people, and the majority of his employees don’t get stock options, so what exactly is your point?
2382 2018-07-17 00:08:35 Weapons manufacturers stocks?
2383 2018-07-17 00:07:53 You are obviously under invested in military supply and energy stocks. There's less money in peace.
2384 2018-07-17 00:07:25 Asia stocks begin indecisive following a similar performance in US where focus was on earnings and weakness in crude; ASX 200 (-0.3%), Nikkei 225 (-0.1%), KOSPI (Unch.)
2385 2018-07-17 00:04:55 Netflix stocks plummeted after hours.  I think it’s about time.  They’re up nearly 100% this year.
