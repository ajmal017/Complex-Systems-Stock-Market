40 2018-01-05 23:58:39 Right now it so happens that majority of value is transferred through banks, big FI's, if that changes in the future, the network can adapt. No matter where/how value is transferred in the future, it will transfer quickest/easiest with Ripple Network + $XRP as bridge/liquidity /2
41 2018-01-05 23:58:31 I love it
42 2018-01-05 23:58:27 What is with this ridiculous trend of you posting videos wearing a shirt suddenly?! 
43 2018-01-05 23:58:18 Window dressing to talk up confidence / interest but it won't be successful and wont attract crypto speculators bcse it's just paper debt
44 2018-01-05 23:58:14 Termination of WC’s Visa membership likely has little (if anything) to do with crypto. Visa terminates memberships all the time for lack of compliance with Visa rules. Notice that *all* card programs have been terminated, not just the btc-backed cards.

51 2018-01-05 23:57:53 Hi Peter, thanks. I see XRP going down. XRP is just a digital/crypto currency value of banks and has technically nothing new. For me it is not clear who has pumped money in? Is this a battle to destroy BTC? What do you personally think about QASH?
52 2018-01-05 23:57:53 not against tech of ripple (mostly btc originally) at all - just the way token has been pumped

+ banks should be decentralized - thats kinda the point of crypto

56 2018-01-05 23:57:41 Oh sorry, that's so much better.. It's not even a crypto currency by definition, it's centralised as hell, and they can literally take xrp off you whenever they want.

60 2018-01-05 23:57:23 I agree. Beautiful thing about Ripple network is it's built to move value all over the world in the fastest, cheapest,  most scalable way. With $XRP as a bridge currency with most liquidity. /1

67 2018-01-05 23:56:52 BTC/crypto is an area where individuals with long experience (and who do their research) can have big advantages over new institutional players. Example: many fund guys I talk to have no idea what BTC halving means. They will learn, painfully and sometimes happily, as they go.
68 2018-01-05 23:56:50 #crypto Exchanges with piss poor capacity planning..... hold your heads in shame

You enable trade. its how you make a buck

So when you're caught with shit capacity & can't make as much money as the market want to give you. unprecedented demand is a fuckin wet dream you knobs

84 2018-01-05 23:55:21 I do agree with you may be it’s not a scam. But it does not justify Market cap in billions. I am seeing first time this kind of stupidity in crypto world.

86 2018-01-05 23:55:06 Great accounts! Followed all...
87 2018-01-05 23:55:03 just a thought... maybe banks paid people to spread FUD for #XRP so they can still afford to buy #XRP and get into the crypto market?? what do you think @haydentiff
88 2018-01-05 23:54:59 We'll eventually either have a crash or get rich on crypto currencies. One of those will make moving back easier

114 2018-01-05 23:52:41 My fave is people who go on tirades over the use of the word "crypto" to refer to the cryptoasset markets etc, and how that apparently makes you an idiot who doesn't understand things because crypto means something else...

I just want to reply to all of them  #yaweknowyouresmart
115 2018-01-05 23:52:35 If anyone's bothered to do their research then they'll know that you're a fantastic guest who can speak extremely confidently about most crypto topics and should already have been hitting you up.

121 2018-01-05 23:51:59 Imagine an audit where you explain 10000 Trades On 10 Exchanges and atomic swaps.
122 2018-01-05 23:51:58 Because it's not a crypto-currency, it's just another way of issuing debt.
123 2018-01-05 23:51:57 
124 2018-01-05 23:51:56 It's all good if you are not a believer in $XRP. 

And I also don't know what it has to do with the price of Ripple because we weren't talking about that.

Besides, if you care about the price for a certain crypto it would mean that you care more about the money than the project

146 2018-01-05 23:50:49 How do you deal with tax? If every trade is taxable, what happens if you pay your tax and then your crypto holdings plummet? Do you risk paying more tax than you earn??
147 2018-01-05 23:50:44 With over 10 years experience in building market platforms, I can say without equivocation, we are better equipped and better than most to build a truly great crypto intelligence platform. Stay tuned.

163 2018-01-05 23:49:20 Smart money patiently waiting with those midcap bags... :-)
164 2018-01-05 23:49:19 $pink great coin definition of undervalued and that word get tossed around a lot in crypto

168 2018-01-05 23:48:57 Can you take it out?
169 2018-01-05 23:48:54 Congrats man, truly mean it.
You’re a great guy, this I can tell even though we don’t know each other and you obviously had to hustle hard AF to be where you are now.
You can be proud! ;)

175 2018-01-05 23:48:44 
176 2018-01-05 23:48:43 Yeah fuck ripple! I don't like making money! 
177 2018-01-05 23:48:42 Not usually. Too busy searching for the next big thing.
178 2018-01-05 23:48:32 $DBC買いました
179 2018-01-05 23:48:30 Also if he made so much money with Bitcoin, enough to peddle some low rent class on "how to get rich in #crypto" all over Facebook - why does he have to raise funds? Can't he do this on his own? Ugh.
180 2018-01-05 23:48:28 I have double checked and I was wrong. My mistake - sorry for misleading with a banking license

182 2018-01-05 23:48:20 Seems to me that it is easy for miners to switch coins and mine a different one. And that most crypto developers have a larger financial incentive to work on a different coin. And fees are high. What economic moat does #BTC have if these happen?

184 2018-01-05 23:48:05 Be patient. As crypto becomes more mainstream, people will want their privacy
185 2018-01-05 23:48:04 Crypto?
186 2018-01-05 23:48:00 I'm currently holding coins, mining, trading with a bot, and have a mining contract. Are there any other investment types I'm missing for crypto? Or have I got them all?
187 2018-01-05 23:47:58 Dramas and disagreements within a crypto community are some metrics we could consider to find out how decentralized a currency is.

By these metrics, It's obviously bitcoin is the only decentralized currency yet.

192 2018-01-05 23:47:28 I appreciate the gesture, but if you think I need that definitions list, you probably did about as much research on my Twitter feed as you did on those coins you're shilling.
193 2018-01-05 23:47:28 Parfait! Merci pour le tip, je voulais justement me faire une alternative à Blockfolio ;)
194 2018-01-05 23:47:17 The purpose is that crypto will not take over overnight. It takes time. 

Also, how many of your daily transactions are in BTC? 
If it's higher than 50%, then great, but there aren't many people that are paying all their transactions in straight btc.
195 2018-01-05 23:47:04 なんか、また8円事件、50円事件

198 2018-01-05 23:46:53 Coinbase charges are really high and Coinbase is not a crypto exchange. We will have to transfer from Coinbase to other exchanges at an even more higher cost. Besides Coinbase is super slow these days in terms of transfer.
199 2018-01-05 23:46:47 Lol kid probably bought $VIA "just in case..." this badass attitude gonna get him rest
200 2018-01-05 23:46:46 coin base just announced that they won't be offering any trading with any additional crypto-currencies, including ripple, so should I pull out of ripple?
201 2018-01-05 23:46:44 Visa can ban crypto cards backed by them but they can’t do no s**t to cryptocurrency revolution. Decentralised cryptocurrencies will find their way ahed. Don’t panic! #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #visacard #DecentralisedRevolution

204 2018-01-05 23:46:33 I missed the xrp train intentionally and I'm damn proud of it.

230 2018-01-05 23:44:51 $TRIG and $DGD delisted from Bittrex
231 2018-01-05 23:44:49 Well, been in only since last Feb and I am most certainly not into those.  Got a little XRP and made a killin' but everything else is in BTC :)
232 2018-01-05 23:44:33 Waiting for more blood, much more blood haha
233 2018-01-05 23:44:29 I know!!! Imagine companies using several products of other companies and making them money... Unheard of! That's why no one gives power to #Facebook either, because how dare we give money to companies that provide a service... 
234 2018-01-05 23:44:27 Lol who are you? We make more in a week on crypto then you have the entire time you've been involved with stock/real estate. Keep hoping for 5% gains in a month man. While you will always be an employee.
235 2018-01-05 23:44:24 My physics/math courses have paid well in the crypto world.... If you understand hydraulics...you understand currency...
236 2018-01-05 23:44:23 Today will be a good lesson for anyone that does not #HODL any #Bitcoin  . #cryptocurrency is fundamentally based around #BTC and until something better replaces it, it is always a good idea to have some in reserve, as it is a sleeping giant that may be waking up again. #crypto
237 2018-01-05 23:44:18 You know nothing. #DYOR #XRP was fueled by CNN and CNBC... the co-founder of Ripple built #XLM to be better than XRP... banks have to use XLM to use the network so unlike ripple the coins value is not speculative. Only a matter of time before xlm passes xrp
238 2018-01-05 23:44:17 back to twitter after several years, mainly to follow crypto currencies news, enjoying the cryptoride, my favourites #verge #trx and big daddy of all coins #btc
239 2018-01-05 23:44:15 ben dgb de arbitraj denedim. ilk 1000 adet gitti, kalan yüklü tutarı gönderdim henüz düşmedi bekliyorum. polo da 636, bittrexte 680 sats. sc ye ben de baktım ama wallet kapalı bittrexte, dgb de açık.
240 2018-01-05 23:44:06 I could take my profits from crypto trading the past couple weeks and finish some projects I've been working on, but I feel like in a month or so I'll just think about the money I missed out on from not keeping it in my trades  the struggle
241 2018-01-05 23:44:05 aaaand it's gone, broke to the downside
242 2018-01-05 23:44:02 i can read articles & watch videos of people claiming aliens came to earth and took them to space - it doesn't mean it's true - learn to start trusting better sources
243 2018-01-05 23:44:02 @crypto_bobby Do i sell my alts or do i just close my eyes and let the storm pass?

247 2018-01-05 23:43:44 follow the mentally ill, $DGB is next
248 2018-01-05 23:43:35 If you keep more than 10% of your coin anywhere other than cold storage, you have only yourself to blame.  Coinbase, Poloniex, they're all having trouble with this #crypto craze.  Be your own bank - that's what #cryptocurrency is all about.

253 2018-01-05 23:43:16 Also, after I buy crypto, all I’m going to tweet about is how it is the future and how everyone needs to get it in right away
254 2018-01-05 23:43:16 Omg thank you master 
255 2018-01-05 23:43:06 Any coin that is yet to pump in alt season always gets cliche attackers because they likely lost money in it. 99% of the time they end up wishing they hodled.
256 2018-01-05 23:43:06 Cool...As an aside...Anyone doing research of #XRP or any #cryptocurrency for that matter. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. 1st rule of crypto: TRUST NO ONE. Especially people online. 
257 2018-01-05 23:43:05 Embercoin and paccoin moving along nice now
258 2018-01-05 23:43:02 We will see. But the last 4 years in crypto have treated me quite well. And I agree with you, I still continue to learn everyday.
259 2018-01-05 23:43:02 XRP is NOT a crypto-currency because it is centralized w no mining processes. it should not even be listed in crypto-currency marketcaps because it is a Digital Fiat Currency . it is more of a digital version of USD.
260 2018-01-05 23:42:56 Crypto is a space where you feel like you live half a year in a week. The price ARN looks like its still going up at 450% you might fall over if it reached a 1000% WWKW
261 2018-01-05 23:42:55 #Bitcoin back above $17,000. $GBTC up another 6% today.   Enjoy the weekend #crypto traders!

265 2018-01-05 23:42:48 Is that the inside pick - blink once for no and twice for yes lol
266 2018-01-05 23:42:43 again, this is false:
- Ripple has owners - Ripple helps adoption of $xrp 
- $XRP has no owners - it is just as free as $BTC 
- @Ripple tweeted today that 3 of 5 top payment co's are using $xrp in 2018 
I could go on and on - don't speak about something you know nothing about
267 2018-01-05 23:42:43 Regardless of the stats (in)accuracy I couldn’t agree more re supporting women in blockchain @AUblockchain @pipryan @JosephLoretta @abelotti
268 2018-01-05 23:42:29 $TRX Tron isn’t your average crypto. It’s breaking the rules and the bus is about to leave again.

270 2018-01-05 23:42:21 As i gain more crypto knowledge you realize how little commonsense most participants in crypto have. Voting with your dollars works when you arent clueless, muddies the waters when youre clueless. Than you meet people lile you on twitter and a little faith is restored.
271 2018-01-05 23:42:16 What value do you get from any crypto other than enriching the current holders?
272 2018-01-05 23:42:05 投資するなら余剰資金で。

虎の子のお金まで投資に使うと、冷静な判断ができなくなる！

投資中は、常に平らな気持ちをキープ！
自分を見失ったらアウト～！！

その点、積立投資なら、相場が上がっても下がっても、冷静でいられます。

積立投資は、下がったら買い増しのチャンス！

286 2018-01-05 23:41:10 XRP is not a crypto for the simple reason that it is a centralised consensus.
287 2018-01-05 23:41:08 Take a look at #ARN

288 2018-01-05 23:41:08 ok good luck
289 2018-01-05 23:40:54 still slow transfer times

291 2018-01-05 23:40:33 Mon bro @ec_valouzz tu juge choisis par rapport a quoi tes crypto?
292 2018-01-05 23:40:25 Because I just started with crypto, and although I know u should get one, I always postpone the decision to buy it for next month. And I hate that they are cheap in France and 20€ more in Belgium or Spain.
293 2018-01-05 23:40:23 thanks for this critical info! fellow newbies must be alerted!  
294 2018-01-05 23:40:16 Even mentioning the word bubble in the crypto world is like overhearing someone say Voldemort at Hogwarts.
295 2018-01-05 23:40:13 If I put all the money I wasted on dating last year into crypto I'd easily be driving a GT-R right now
296 2018-01-05 23:40:07 @coinbase @CoinbaseSupport I would really love it if you would process transfers faster than 12 hours....I’d be okay if it were 4, I could deal with that. But this is really discouraging at the current moment. Thanks. #trx #btc #eth #xvg #ltc #crypto

304 2018-01-05 23:39:42 i first looked at xrp for about five minutes and saw owners(it has owners) owned over half the supply and passed. it speaks for itself. all of the pumps have come from 'rumours'. The banks won't give economic power to ripple foundatoin when they can just use the tech!
305 2018-01-05 23:39:37 Went from sleeping on the bus to looking at stock and crypto trends... what happened to me?
306 2018-01-05 23:39:35 BitPanda to buy your BTC ETH etc

308 2018-01-05 23:39:14 DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. D not rely on others to tell you when to sell or when to buy. If you rely on others you will never learn and never grow that portfolio. #DOR #Crypto #invest
309 2018-01-05 23:39:14 Same as TRX. On the other hand, crypto needst stabillity. Or it will never be a steady valuta like banks. almost think that mayor banks or gouvernements are behind this? Whats you:re thoughts?
Sorry for my english
310 2018-01-05 23:39:14 Bitch where ? I was spoken and treated like a king when I did that the other day. And I’m Mexican lol
311 2018-01-05 23:39:13 最大手数料（0.0198072 BTC）のときのBitcoin Transactionをみると，inputが10個で，outputが1個でした。しかしそのサイズは16421bytesで，148∗10+34∗1+10=1524bytesよりずっと大きい。
312 2018-01-05 23:39:12 Obviously a very hypothetical question, but if China were able to block RMB from being used to buy crypto, would that bring about a massive collapse?
313 2018-01-05 23:39:10 blaaaah, i don't have the time to hand hold people & twitter doesn't allow for proper length of discussion - good luck Vin. I'll give you a piece of advice: if you don't hold something & don't care - maybe don't spend so much time reading/engaging with it 
314 2018-01-05 23:39:07 Can you message us? We would love to send you some swag for being so awesome  - Brittnee

318 2018-01-05 23:38:42 Fuck Texas for banning crypto momentarily !!
319 2018-01-05 23:38:42 Try sign up to cryptoia for your exchange
320 2018-01-05 23:38:24 Tip of the day: when bitcoin does well, altcoins do bad. Don’t be scared, just give it some time.

322 2018-01-05 23:38:21 of course it did because BTC when on a bull run. Just hold. dont sell
323 2018-01-05 23:38:13 So now as it went through the 17000$ mark where is next target, 20k? Or way lower at 17600$?
324 2018-01-05 23:38:09 Man from running my business, studying crypto/investing. I am down to an 2-3 hour window of sleep.
325 2018-01-05 23:38:05 I'm probably one of a small group of people both trading ether and using it to start frozen farm equipment today.   Not much of a crypto scene in rural midwest.
326 2018-01-05 23:38:04 I never claimed I knew? What are you even talking about.

330 2018-01-05 23:37:52 Feature #SmartCash , in an article about community based voting governance and its potential for crypto, there are enough crypto's out there with voting based governance for a good article with comparisons, its the $smart thing to do.
331 2018-01-05 23:37:52 I think the East Coast is buying up $BTC and crypto to get out of that frozen ice bucket asap o_O
332 2018-01-05 23:37:46 What
333 2018-01-05 23:37:41 @twobitidiot thank you for retail crypto crack — my newest concise retort to “what do you think about...”
334 2018-01-05 23:37:39 Friedly reminder - never store your crypto on exchanges. Look into hardware wallets like:

Ledger s nano - @LedgerHQ 
Trezor - @TREZOR 
keepkey - @bitcoinkeepkey
335 2018-01-05 23:37:37 The feeling is mutual
336 2018-01-05 23:37:37 Thank you for the kinds words! :)

347 2018-01-05 23:36:31 When I grow up, I want to trade as well as @DonnyCrypto
348 2018-01-05 23:36:29 Buying bottoms instead of tops and also doing good research and studying also helps.  Then you don't need to worry, and you will have skills that aren't fully reliant on other people.  #Investinyoselfmore

361 2018-01-05 23:35:36 from where is coming your information they have a banking license ?
362 2018-01-05 23:35:36 Scrolled down my cash app and seen how many times I copped and cried knowing I could have put that into crypto lmao
363 2018-01-05 23:35:26 XVG call was when price was below 150 satoshi, DGB at 350 satoshi, TRON at 200 satoshi , Look at the prices now and compare, so those were great calls. You would make average of over 500% profit with those. I am glad that I risked and made it. Lets see Bezop in few months ;)
364 2018-01-05 23:35:25 yes it will  can't wait
365 2018-01-05 23:35:18 Sweet!!!

368 2018-01-05 23:35:07 We can make this better by making sure @UTRUST_Official is well known and used for real stuffs out there because it is the future of crypto payment

372 2018-01-05 23:34:36 “Institutional investors want to build crypto portfolios, but they struggle with unregulated exchanges and are uncomfortable with the complexity of holding tokens and rampant price manipulation.” - Legolas' CEO @fred_montagnon

373 2018-01-05 23:34:35 That would make sense once you're free financially. But until my mortgage and student loans are paid off (or until they accept crypto for payment ), being up in USD is not a bad thing.
374 2018-01-05 23:34:34 What you mean money?

379 2018-01-05 23:34:24 #XRP was made so banks can steal your bitcoin in exchange for it and at the end they will hold majority of bitcoin & have control over it. While shitcoin XRP will be worth nothing.

398 2018-01-05 23:33:03 【JPYマイニング】
・JPY＝日本円
・マイニング＝仮想通貨の世界では「収益を得ること」

つまり、JPYマイニングとは、
「日本円を稼ぐこと」
多くの場合「労働で得た稼ぎ」を指す。

仮想通貨に投資するなら、JPYマイニングが基本です！

454 2018-01-05 23:28:07 Why? There’s nothing special about $XVG There are already many anonymous crypto’s what’s the big deal it’s a failed project
455 2018-01-05 23:28:07 sometimes I feel like its giving me brain damage.  Although, it could be the lack of sleep, or maybe I was dropped on my head as a child. Vaccine damaged?  Take your pick haha

as do most people who have been in crypto for more than a few months..

xrp only shill in korea/ japan etc for profit..
467 2018-01-05 23:27:11 Is the profits from the smash hit for the crypto ayyyy
468 2018-01-05 23:27:04 I am sitting here contemplating managing portfolios for people who are scared to get into the crypto space.
469 2018-01-05 23:27:02 crypto-bridgeのビットコ出金高いなー
0.003って今ビットコ200万だから6000円もかかるよ
470 2018-01-05 23:27:02 Once we some Crypto millionaires.. 
471 2018-01-05 23:26:52 Were i can find a prediction chat?
472 2018-01-05 23:26:47 Why? They still have a profitable gold business and if anything the volume & commissions would probably increase in a bear market
473 2018-01-05 23:26:41 The crypto space is changing the world as we know it. The current Bit coin is not doing what it was originally supposed to do. Facts are facts. Stop all the in fighting and enjoy making money and making the world a better place for all.
474 2018-01-05 23:26:41 If it goes, it goes. What’s $400?  Let ‘er ride.
475 2018-01-05 23:26:32 6pm what time zone!?
476 2018-01-05 23:26:31 It’s not that I’m bored of my new friends (TRX, XRP, XLM, POE, STRAT, DASH etc)... but there’s nothing like an old friend coming back into your life. You’re still my BFF BTC  #bitcoin 
477 2018-01-05 23:26:31 Learning from the best, I appreciate it Sav! 
478 2018-01-05 23:26:30 So where is the problem, why this craziness today?
479 2018-01-05 23:26:23 39% capital gain tax is already verified. you have a computer or phone connected to the internet. maybe you can verify yourself haha
480 2018-01-05 23:26:15 Lucky I don’t have time but nobody is doing the crypto mining business correctly through ecommerce - 0 trust and reputation on most and majority use bootleg sites #magento #sales #bitcoin #mining #crypto

482 2018-01-05 23:26:11 I see. Unfortunately the majority of things cannot be paid by crypto yet and those cards were proving very convenient for those who chose to leave off crypto today. Let's see what others solutions will pop up.
483 2018-01-05 23:26:04 They are small sharks
484 2018-01-05 23:25:57 Clearly sgx, or for that matter any single tech, cannot solve everything but it is true that the attack surface of software necessary for implementing crypto primitives may make hardware more attractive for defense. Also performance.
485 2018-01-05 23:25:56 Interesting. I think that that ARK soon will cost 2$ and will not recover anymore because too big losses.
486 2018-01-05 23:25:54 That's a lot, but i like your vision!
487 2018-01-05 23:25:50 Monaco has banking license, visa program manager deal and much better team. TenX is not even close

505 2018-01-05 23:24:33 I would need 2 one for my dad and one for me. But I don't mind keeping track on Blockfolio until I can afford one. I'm trying to bring my family out of poverty and a @trezor or @ledgerhq would help keep our crypto investments safe! Happy trading guys!
506 2018-01-05 23:24:28 Heard they did this to USI too
507 2018-01-05 23:24:19 If you're not mining your own cryptos, then the options get slightly more limited. If you can mine a crypto that is profitable, then you can exchange it a number of ways (eg Changelly), keep it in a wallet like Airbitz for actual usage.
508 2018-01-05 23:24:18 No signs of EOS exploding...Just like the last 2 analysis.
509 2018-01-05 23:24:15  What if you could create a coin or smart contract that rewarded people who built the best crypto portfolios.
510 2018-01-05 23:24:10 agree.. this whole "i knew it was gonna 100x" is all bs. luck of the pump.

514 2018-01-05 23:23:38 @paccoin_net Why did 1 trillion disappear from the supply?! It made PAC fall down the charts 10 spots or so. @CoinMarketCap #PAC #NextBitcoin #Bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency  Please fix this bug!
515 2018-01-05 23:23:36 Seems likely that custom crypto chips provided by NSA  etc will be optimised for security over performance, although lots of COTS stuff doing AES these days...

520 2018-01-05 23:23:19 I don't know how someone can buy a coin and then get upset when they haven't tripled their investment in a week then dump at a loss? Crypto is a really quick way to turn an investment but in a few days? you gotta do your research and hold - give it months, lol.
521 2018-01-05 23:23:17 Did it break the channel?

523 2018-01-05 23:23:01 So far this crypto investment thing has been working out wonderfully. In the past week I have made just over a double up.
524 2018-01-05 23:22:55 Stupidest thing I’ve ever heard  relying on crypto to change your life??
525 2018-01-05 23:22:48 I cannot help but feel the warning has been on the door all along.

Pretty much everyone I know who has joined the crypto space in the last 3-6months gives 0 fcuks about decentralisation.

This is just quick & easy money for them. They will buy any altcoin as long as they can $$
526 2018-01-05 23:22:40 Carve out your space and get comfortable....  #staysavy
527 2018-01-05 23:22:39 @CryptoBridge  Hey Cryptobridge.. the BTC I send 4 hrs ago which had like 20 confirmations so far does not show up in my crypto bridge BTC wallet. Openned support ticket but nobody responding. Please look into this ..

532 2018-01-05 23:22:19 @moor_free what do you meen when you say "really taken off" ? 
If you follow ex. @CoinMarketCap you will see coins and tokens that have made 100-1000 times the last month.. hell, the last week or days ! Take @Tronfoundation, Aeron (ARN), PACcoin (PAC) and so on... There are lots
533 2018-01-05 23:22:19 Can you give a couple of examples of how much they pay?
534 2018-01-05 23:22:16 I think they are close to the resolutions. Their successful build and the explosion may end up coinciding with one another
535 2018-01-05 23:22:12 Crypto market skyrockets on Payday. What a coincidence.
536 2018-01-05 23:22:12 GCR next week

542 2018-01-05 23:21:47 Leaving a moon bag is the most appropriate action probably, but even if sold all of it at 5x I wouldn't consider it a mistake. Getting a 100x is usually not a matter of skill, but luck, like a lottery ticket.

545 2018-01-05 23:21:32 Great reporting. I've said before but no one listens which is fine, Crypto needs their own bank to make it work. Fuck all the credick cod companies except discover who is extremely cool. Crypto Bank must become a magnet, sucking blood dry at CC Companies

547 2018-01-05 23:21:29 @CryptoLez how does it feel to have a frog headed ninja as your first follower?
548 2018-01-05 23:21:29 It could very well be a crypto that launches sometime in 2018 itself. I voted SUB though, very promising imo.
549 2018-01-05 23:21:27 Nice one Mick
550 2018-01-05 23:21:24 Nop, no dream lol. Its crazy isnt it. It has happened to other crypto's and they have held their price. I'm holding PACCOIN long term.....
551 2018-01-05 23:21:20 I think it’s a good idea to place bets on cryptos that are under $0.10 regardless of supply. New crypto people just want a lot of coins and don’t think about supply. There is going to be tons of these new people soon. They don’t buy $20 cryptos and they don’t mind buying ATH.

554 2018-01-05 23:21:04 Can’t stand all these “crypto personalities” suddenly grilling tron cuz their source of info, another personality says. No bcash or xrp.
555 2018-01-05 23:20:47 I care about decentralization. But I look at the bigger picture on how crypto would eventually become the main thing. 

If banks start using Ripple seriously, then more nocoiners will enter the crypto market.

563 2018-01-05 23:20:24 Here’s an idea: buy crypto currency and make a large amount of money. Take that money and buy rental properties. Take your monthly profit from the rentals and buy more crypto currency. Repeat. Be wealthy.
564 2018-01-05 23:20:06 Glad I had a hell of a run on that one and got out of it weeks ago.  Feels good.
565 2018-01-05 23:20:05 yeah, when eos starts to go, it'll be like TRX.  don't know why people taking a wait and see approach with dan larimer's latest project, he's already proven himself with the first two projects.

anyways, good for us to accumulate. EOS going to be like TRX when it starts to moon.

572 2018-01-05 23:19:23 It's all too complicated for my tiny IQ to compute, but surely once the penny drops for the Chinese government about how much cash is being moved out of the country in crypto they will go after it hard?
573 2018-01-05 23:19:10 No like when you
buy crypto you Existing fiat, what crypto just did inflate the currency volume.
To chase after the same amount of goods  without adding new.
574 2018-01-05 23:18:57 You never know  haejin is a Jedi - he could be right
575 2018-01-05 23:18:51 So for example, a company could launch an ICO with their own token. The token would be used for loyalty programmes - it would be kind of an add-on to the interaction with consumers. That's what they would like to see applied in future.
576 2018-01-05 23:18:46 Crypto is FUN!!! Thx for the opportunity!! :)

584 2018-01-05 23:18:23 @BleedingHedge who knew a random dude asking me the price of BTC would lead to a really interesting convo? Nice to see crypto people around!
585 2018-01-05 23:18:23 I was lucky enough to be in the business during the dot com boom.  I just got into this about 2 months ago as a hobby, and I think the crypto industry has the ability to make more regular people money then anything in history.
586 2018-01-05 23:18:18 All of Crypto is a strong buy (according to my barber).
587 2018-01-05 23:18:10 Bought $XVG think this one will be Huge !! - It improves upon the original Bitcoin #blockchain & aims to fulfill its initial purpose of providing individuals & businesses with a fast, efficient & decentralized way of making direct transactions while maintaining personal privacy.

590 2018-01-05 23:17:39 Standard Southern Cross for AU right?
591 2018-01-05 23:17:36 Also I did sell all my #XVG to pick up more #TRX. Not saying it think #XVG is going to be a bust I just trust my money with Tron right now. @justinsuntron is a very respected and reputable man in the Tech world and I think his outlook on crypto is fantastic

605 2018-01-05 23:16:34 infighting in #bitcoin at a crucial time (when 'masses' finally want in to crypto) has messed a lot up

if bitcoin fails we will live in a sanitised bubble with zero freedoms - think..

608 2018-01-05 23:16:27 I sense there was a joke there, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a crypto day trader, so it went over my head. The only crypto I have at the moment is some SUB that I got as a Christmas present from our CEO. So far I haven't moved it.

616 2018-01-05 23:15:45 And I never said I did not have other means. My question is broad as to what will we do now to live off crypto. I feel it was taken slightly out of context and also did not appreciate the 'stupid' word being used. @wirexapp not impressed you keep liking these tweets. Tks
617 2018-01-05 23:15:44 Great post!  Thanks for taking the time to write it.
618 2018-01-05 23:15:39 #zipperglobal, this is what the crypto need to get adopted by average users, and it is already working!!

621 2018-01-05 23:15:26 Call it a gut feeling, but I don't see Bitcoin going anywhere else. Too expensive, too slow, fees too high. Too late to get in for the average Joe. Mostly owned by whales anyways.

633 2018-01-05 23:14:49 @justinsuntron was part of the start up of ripple. Don’t blame other people in believing the new crypto.  Stay away and don’t say negative words because you’re the dip****
634 2018-01-05 23:14:49 I tweeted this yesterday but anyone know any good books to order about crypto?

*Maybe I should put "ASPIRING translator between crypto and traditional finance"
646 2018-01-05 23:14:16 You buy with litecoin or dodge
647 2018-01-05 23:14:13 Seems ok, BUT the smaller the exchange, the larger the risk in general. And they are having scale up trouble with influx of traffic. Any crypto left on an exchange is always at risk of losing - Always remember that. I speak from experience (lost big $$$ in mintpal heist in 2014).
648 2018-01-05 23:14:11 欠乏の心理なんですよね…。

649 2018-01-05 23:14:05 Not to mention XRP is sold on crypto exchanges and non of them are in the US. Again, SEC has no jurisdiction.
650 2018-01-05 23:14:01 They never shared? it was the media that hyped it up

10,000 $ worth of crypto with his US dollars and received 10,000 worth of
crypto in his cyberspace wallet. the exchange received his 10,000 $ both happy.
wait !!!! 
now both party
can spend 10,000 worth of goods! Where
did the other 10,000 worth come from. !
661 2018-01-05 23:13:19 Ripple can go where every it wants lol it’s not decentralized  #manipulation
662 2018-01-05 23:13:12 Lmao. That is a stupid play
663 2018-01-05 23:13:12 It'll resume going that way if BTC can break the post-futures resistance. #btc going up in value is good for me, though I hold little. For #xrp to go to $10, to $100 would require total crypto market to increase a LOT. That can only happen with new entrants. It's not a zero sum.

668 2018-01-05 23:12:58 would you guys be interested in me making a video on the basics of crypto currencies and how to trade them?

673 2018-01-05 23:12:56 @PACcoinCZAR  New to crypto.I have a question. Can we move pac coins from one wallet to another ..ex: Mac wallet to windows wallet and what if my pc crashes?
674 2018-01-05 23:12:47 Future of crypto?
675 2018-01-05 23:12:41 What you mean?  Not a good buy?
676 2018-01-05 23:12:41 most come to crypto for money - discover bitcoin + if they make money they leave to pursue own fantasies to satisfy own egos - maxwell ver even larry or vitalik 

#bitcoin moves on -open- noone is forcing anyone to stay/ go!

but #btc is about more than money- are any others?
677 2018-01-05 23:12:41 Just back from a quick lunch trip to Arby's and got tipped off to the newest crypto spike. Turns out it's gonna be in condiments packets.
You heard it here first.
678 2018-01-05 23:12:32 It will be #epic #crypto Year!  These are great investments!
679 2018-01-05 23:12:29 they banned wavecreast unfortunally most crypto cards and other non cryptocards have been issued by them. one must find out what the issue with wavecreast is. new issuer should be ready soon.
680 2018-01-05 23:12:27 They must know that bitconnect owners are going to wipe their as with this "order" lol. Funny how the US thinks they can stop an anon lending scheme in another country. Not going to happen. Crypto has no borders and no rulers!
681 2018-01-05 23:12:19 I can also recommend the rum and coke without the rum if you catch my drift.
682 2018-01-05 23:12:12 Nope they compliment each other. BTS is the underlying token to run the entire system. So each time a trade is made on Crypto-Bridge or Openledger a small fee goes back into the Bitshares ecosystem which is then used to fund worker proposals that are voted on by the token holders
683 2018-01-05 23:12:07 @dadi and @WillLebens any response from you on this?
684 2018-01-05 23:12:02 Yeah man, going out

689 2018-01-05 23:11:54 the ripple foundation process all txs & can/ have frozen transactions. its completely centralised. they can censor txs if they wish. 60% arp owned by two heads of foundation! They could dump on you and your wealth is gone!

Hi Steve

I respect your view and your work.

I hope you can voice expose scam about bitcoin or any Crypto

First please forgive me as English is not my first language.
708 2018-01-05 23:11:02 What do you think of Myriad. You've been around for a long time in crypto. Are you familiar with that coin?
709 2018-01-05 23:10:51 Now you're just being silly
710 2018-01-05 23:10:51 Feels wrong to compare net worth based on crypto valuation against stock valuation
711 2018-01-05 23:10:50 Cette entrée magnifique. C'est grâce à toi que jai commencé à m'intéresser à la crypto, et je t'en remercie. Je te donne toute la reussite et le bonheur du monde. <3
712 2018-01-05 23:10:50 Anyway around it? When will the exchange be online again?

715 2018-01-05 23:10:41 I'm long term as I see lots of similarities in ADA to Eth as I did from Eth to BTC.

That said, I want ledger support....and I've honestly been so disappointed with MOST wallets and their UI's in teh crypto scene
716 2018-01-05 23:10:37 Nah... judge yourself
717 2018-01-05 23:10:35 2018 es un buen año para invertir en crypto monedas. Para todos aquellos enteresados en el tema las sugerencias son Bitcoin, Ripple, Tron y Kin. De la más fuerte una de las más jovenes pero con mucho potencial ¿Qué opinan ustedes?
718 2018-01-05 23:10:32 I like that it is open source, transparent and decentralised but at the same time will offer the choice of real transaction privacy or public transparency. The Verge team and devs are real people that aren't perfect but are passionate and have the ability to deliver the tech.

727 2018-01-05 23:09:56 How long do you see this dip lasting?  $ICX rebound soon?
728 2018-01-05 23:09:47 Unless Ethereum turns out to be the Goldilocks of crypto -- enough decentralization to resist all attacks that actually happen (and deter the rest), but enough throughput to hold onto its network effect.

732 2018-01-05 23:09:34 Do your crypto reports have indications of entry points, stop losses, exits, when to take profits or are they restrict to fundamentals?
733 2018-01-05 23:09:26 Lol when you hold $xrp in your wallet, you have the exact same control of it as you do $btc in your wallet. If that's the only value prop for $btc, then it's not as good as $xrp's b/c $xrp also gets used by FI's to settle cross-border payments at less cost than how they do it now

748 2018-01-05 23:08:38 Well the cap I’m not worried about. More money coming into crypto now then ever plus if #XVG does come out on top it’s likely that we would take the market cap of other coins offering same services. We are going to see coinmarketcap show money in the trillions this year

772 2018-01-05 23:07:25 IP obfuscation over TOR and stealth transactions using stealth addresses aren't the same thing. TOR integration so far is still being worked on. Stealth addresses are nothing new for privacy coins.

u spoken to people at african btc exchanges for 4 years?

u know most africans were priced out 3 yrs ago?

u know many mined #ltc and swaped in chunks to hodl #btc?

thought not..
775 2018-01-05 23:07:06 All a nigga tryna do is buy some crypto coins B. Especially Ripple.
776 2018-01-05 23:07:04 Yea you buy bitcoin put it on the account and you can buy and sell crypto like stocks
777 2018-01-05 23:07:01 Thanks but aint got any 
778 2018-01-05 23:07:01 .@coinbase, i love you guys but you have got to get this scalability thing down. throw an $M at your engineering team and figure this out. you're primed to lose the spot as the first go-to crypto app if you can't get it together and fix these lags. rooting for you, but man alive.
779 2018-01-05 23:06:50 Your wrong, #XRP is a token issued by a company , company and insiders if dumping into a orchestrated paid pump is still securities fraud whether private or not.  Fincen would be the one to enforce this, and they would use the SEC definition.  Since #XRP is not a crypto currency
780 2018-01-05 23:06:47 Crypto buying? Buying #TRON (#TRX) and #Litecoin ( #LTC) .. shits on the up 
781 2018-01-05 23:06:46  $BNB back on a surge again, passing yesterday's ATH 

Native token to #Binance. The team at @binance_2017 led by @cz_binance are far more than an exchange. One to watch 
#cryptocurrency #cryptoexchanges $BTC #bitcoin
782 2018-01-05 23:06:39 That would be something!
783 2018-01-05 23:06:35 true. Have worked with plenty of mugs with NO bank account who paid 7% check cashing fee each friday then similar fees to transfer to Jamaica .  THESE ARE THE SAME low IQ MUGS WHO USE HIGH ST BOOKIES INSTEAD OF BF 15 YEARS AFTER BF WAS INVENTED. No chance they work out crypto ffs
784 2018-01-05 23:06:32 #crypto POLL: Where wil #BTC go in the next 24-48 hours?

785 2018-01-05 23:06:28 It’s very common for crypto currency to be volatile, especially at its early stages. As long as it doesn’t plunged more than 50% then it’s all good. Checkout the BTC prices in earlier years you will notice it was very volatile too.

788 2018-01-05 23:06:06 $nxt is the biggest piece of shit coin. Worst mistake I’ve made to date in crypto. Weak ass company and weak ass supporters. I cannot wait to get out of this shitcoin and never look back.
789 2018-01-05 23:05:49 Explain to me how it is a piece of shit. Entertain me please.

795 2018-01-05 23:05:35 Although your breakdown seems like sound logic, you can apply this "list" to just about any crypto currency out there without a purpose. What other crypto currency can you name that is successfully integrating into today's society?
796 2018-01-05 23:05:26 im getting $doge dog on my shaft
797 2018-01-05 23:05:25 Hey @Moker_1977 just remembered you are new, probably are getting kinda scared by all the dipping coins. Dont worry crypto works with cycles, now btc is rising and all alts drop a bit. When bitcoin is stable all alts will come back and some set new All time highs. 1/2
798 2018-01-05 23:05:21 so they pumped the book #FireandFurry like a new #crypto lol uknow uc?LOL too funny o_O

802 2018-01-05 23:05:05 is $1000 to $164,000 in 12 months a good deal?

803 2018-01-05 23:04:58 haha, that's all that matters
804 2018-01-05 23:04:56 I don’t have one because I leave my  new trezor to my lovely father in law (80 years old) for him to start in crypto 
805 2018-01-05 23:04:51 Up until the end of 17 most of my orders focused on USD value, $10 25 50 100..  Beginning '18 all my orders with be 2 digits focused on crypto quantity.

This will simplify everything.  If I buy 0.0045 btc for $50 and sell .003 for 50 (48.51 after fee) 150,000sat for $1.49
806 2018-01-05 23:04:46 Yes sir. I am also about to put into HTML coin. Looks like a good coin and I think it will do well. It's on Binance now yeah?
807 2018-01-05 23:04:41 Starting to learn how to effectively invest in crypto, new JBL speaker came so I am caressed by lovely sounds, engulfed in the scent of mistletoe from my candle, and just received "Food of the Gods" by Terence McKenna to get back into reading. Life feels warm.
808 2018-01-05 23:04:33 Does this scare anyone else (even just a little)? A federal crypto is just a centralized, panopticon currency.
809 2018-01-05 23:04:26 they are not accepting new customers, no idea when they will re-open

813 2018-01-05 23:04:08 In Hodl we Trust
814 2018-01-05 23:04:08 Lets go
815 2018-01-05 23:04:06 Well duh, how do you think they plan on paying back the money they stole?
816 2018-01-05 23:04:04 Well its happening now innit mate
817 2018-01-05 23:04:03 No way. @CRYPTOBANGer for sure was talking about $ZCL way back.
818 2018-01-05 23:04:02 Alright my crypto currency peeps, are we buying Tron or nah?!
819 2018-01-05 23:03:59 I have been around few years but just started with these twitter posts after much push family/friends
820 2018-01-05 23:03:55 REEEEEE!!!!!
821 2018-01-05 23:03:52 Then sell it and reinvest, I did and already quadrupled my investment. XVG has had too many shady mishaps imho
822 2018-01-05 23:03:43 This sucks i need to buy more Crypto!!!!
823 2018-01-05 23:03:33 In my view, to get behind the projects we understand and believe in and help them in any way we can, because their success will mean our success (financially). Right now, the crypto space is one giant race of badmouthing and crapping on anyone who doesn't agree with oneself.
824 2018-01-05 23:03:33 アルトの投げ売り大会ですね。BTCさんバカにしてた人は反省してください
825 2018-01-05 23:03:30 TELL EM GIRL

827 2018-01-05 23:03:18 Yeah, I dont think the IRS will enjoy going through trillions of trades..
828 2018-01-05 23:03:10 Same here... but I held that dump truck full.  I had some sad days watching everyone have their fun with BTC since August! but well worth the wait!
829 2018-01-05 23:03:05 1) Pourquoi ne pas s'attaquer au problème des vidéos Youtube qui consomment bien plus d'énergie ?

2) Le domaine des crypto-monnaies est en plein expérimentation et devra passer par une phase d'optimisation. Mais il faut construire un système avant de l'optimiser.
830 2018-01-05 23:03:01 おはよー。最近、コンスタントだね☆
831 2018-01-05 23:02:57 Been a bad day for crypto today, 18% down overall, but remember check your weekly % as it’s been a great week overall, 43% up, almost doubled your investment! #crypto #CryptoCurrencies
832 2018-01-05 23:02:42 I don’t think they will change it . A capital gain is a less than 12 month hold .
833 2018-01-05 23:02:40 ..will be writing a crypto for the basic white girl after today.
834 2018-01-05 23:02:39 And your servers are still crap. I could understand if issue was for few days, maybe 2 weeks, but few months? You had one job... One business. Making sure your servers are fast enough to cope with traffic predicted by many. News: crypto traffic is going up, not down... !
835 2018-01-05 23:02:33 Over Kelce!?! 
836 2018-01-05 23:02:25 I am all new in crypto. It is more that i have now.... hit mee
837 2018-01-05 23:02:25 @ProfSteveKeen a man bought 10,000 $ worth of crypto with his US dollars and received 10,000 worth of crypto in his cyberspace wallet. the exchange received his 10,000 $ both happy. wait !!!!  now both party can spend 10,000 worth of goods!
838 2018-01-05 23:02:21 I think his point is that Amazon actually had a store. Tron doesn't even have that. Still just an idea. No actual functionality yet.

I'm loving my tron bags, but it's way overvalued for what it actually has to offer.
839 2018-01-05 23:02:20 I am not surprised at all that all crypto anti-bank revolutionaires here have no clue what BK is. It's not burger king, it's Bank of New York Mellon !!!

Now, do you want to grow your wealth with Tone Vays & AAntonopoulos or with BK?

840 2018-01-05 23:02:15 I don't really get you. How do you add a stop loss to every trade you make? Please explain
841 2018-01-05 23:01:58 Dimension 3R_298 glitched, the glitch was mirrored across multitudes of other dimensions depending on alignment.

844 2018-01-05 23:01:52 How is this a point? You keep your premined coins so you can get flithy rich on the investments on others... and dump the coin in two years? How does this help the world progress in world of crypto? How does this make tron better than any other pump'n dump coin?

850 2018-01-05 23:01:25 I like bytecoin and used to mine it, haven't bought it recently. But is any news surrounding this insane spike?
851 2018-01-05 23:01:20 @TheAltPump refreshing your page like crazy 
852 2018-01-05 23:01:13 @DonnyCrypto Yo man really liking your view about crypto, could i get the links to the telegram groups you were talking about?
853 2018-01-05 23:01:06 And crypto currency, obviously.
854 2018-01-05 23:01:03 I got it at 160. Still hold a decent bag, but back in August I had a dump truck filled with it. Love $SC
855 2018-01-05 23:01:02 Same request but instead of 10% you get a handwritten thank you note.... SCENTED
856 2018-01-05 23:00:59 @ProfSteveKeen 
Hi Steve
I respect your view and your work.
I hope you can voice expose scam about bitcoin or any Crypto
First please forgive me as English is not my first language.
857 2018-01-05 23:00:59 Crypto currency
858 2018-01-05 23:00:57 Are stocks also subject to 39%, or are they just raping crypto..
859 2018-01-05 23:00:53 Kaboooom. .!!!
860 2018-01-05 23:00:50 Obviously @CryptoChoe was right about the XVG breakout. Maybe playonice has learned a lesson? Probably not and that's fine :) More profit for me while you wish you caught that upward movement :)
861 2018-01-05 23:00:44 Off topic but what do you think is happening to ADA and do you think it will recover? Also how long if so Mr King of Crypto?
862 2018-01-05 23:00:37 Idk man this correction on the alts is coming soon so don't know how long that will last
863 2018-01-05 23:00:36 When you actually decide to read even the most basic breakdown of what things like $macd are.... And you go.... "Oh yeah, makes more sense now".

And now I feel like a $crypto God of course.
864 2018-01-05 23:00:35 Was only after the #WraithProtocol scam that other guys started to commit loose pieces of code, these guys were guys with lots of money in a sh1t coin and commited code to try the manipulate the market pushing the value up, but the coin has no value.
865 2018-01-05 23:00:33 E. Or they bought it , then dumped it and now feel stupid. lol
866 2018-01-05 23:00:30 Absolutely me. At least in case of cryptos. Way too complicated, and this w/o any apparitional use! For me. And I am representing 99% of the people, that’s for sure. #crypto #bitcoin
867 2018-01-05 23:00:29 Like if I should sell all of my stocks and buy crypto currency

880 2018-01-05 22:59:45 In another note I am taking the  technical interview tomorrow for #hackReactor software engineer bootcamp program.
881 2018-01-05 22:59:44 I know what it is, new entrants to the crypto space buy it b/c they think its cheap, & dream of big gains. Ripple offer tech 2 banks. 60% of xrp is owned by two people, it isn't used for anything. it is a scam. Bitcoin is about having control of your money, not giving it to banks
882 2018-01-05 22:59:41 Dat houd in dat als ik de volumes in een bepaalde crypto zie afnemen ik een gedeelte van mijn voorraad crypto inwissel (in dit geval in #LTC) omdat je niet in btc kan kopen of verkopen wel in #litecoin. Winsten nemen is goed bij stijging van 500% ook als het een goedkope munt

895 2018-01-05 22:58:56 FUD sells (from a clickbait point of view)
896 2018-01-05 22:58:53 It's an uphill battle, could be possible. The circulating supply is going to be an issue, going to need major demand so supply is short. They didn't pre-mine, which is good, but prevents a coin burn to drop supply quickly. But #XVG can do it, just be a long term hodl.
897 2018-01-05 22:58:53 Looking forward to a great year in crypto. We have #TRON $TRX in our portfolio. @BrianDEvans @OfficialEGC  @JeremyGoodman10 @aliraja @justinsuntron
898 2018-01-05 22:58:47 No kidding.. people better enjoy this price lol! I bout at 5.20 thinking it was a bargain.. it will bounce back
899 2018-01-05 22:58:44 And the #altcoins flush has just started after #Coinbase didn't keep the promise to add many new coins that soon. Smart crypto traders have used recent pumps in altcoins to increase their bitcoin holding. I am sure though that Coinbase will surprise us again, the question is when
900 2018-01-05 22:58:41 GG I am finished

903 2018-01-05 22:58:23 No FUD brotha.  I'm deeeeep in xvg and a big fan.
904 2018-01-05 22:58:23 I agree!
905 2018-01-05 22:58:22 It’s 1am here in South Africa  so time to sleep but that was a most enjoyable shit chat gents. Thanks for the pearls of wisdom.
906 2018-01-05 22:58:17 Investing in a stock does provide value though, as it allows the company to use the money for building the business. Even if there isn't a return, it provides metrics for the market. The only value I see in the the amount of crypto investors is publicity. Could be wrong though
907 2018-01-05 22:58:17 Mostly because it doesn't involve crypto =)
908 2018-01-05 22:58:14 Or, it’s a fractured project that has been pumped and dumped by @officialmcafee and just needs time to grow. It’s at best a third class privacy coin. $zcash $monaro $bitcoinz I am a HODLer but it’s gonna take a long time to recover

920 2018-01-05 22:57:10 Worse capitalized velocity pos ever. This guy is a handjob. How about some mildly knowledgable crypto sorts?
921 2018-01-05 22:57:06 I like it. Hope you are right again.
922 2018-01-05 22:57:00 Wish I could use my crypto currency in Jamaica

924 2018-01-05 22:56:59 Appreciate the support.  As a #crypto community, we must come together to adopt #blockchain as the wave of change to better our society.  #XVG is killing it in the last month with #WraithProtocol and the new wallet. $XVG
925 2018-01-05 22:56:58 Your mcm has less than 1k worth of crypto and just bought a ledger
926 2018-01-05 22:56:54 its a bank backed coin...the whole opposite idea of why cryptocurrency was invented. Get lost.
927 2018-01-05 22:56:52 The bears are slowly  but surely losing control of the alts #crypto
928 2018-01-05 22:56:50 Great stuff tonight @TheKiffness !! Even better you shilling crypto on stage! $btc $eth see you soon in Durbs!

931 2018-01-05 22:56:33 Thanks for your support Sarah. People like you are helping many escape poverty/ lower income brackets.
932 2018-01-05 22:56:30 Evolution never stops. Same as getting rich. As an example if you are not investing in crypto % of networth... One will be left behind
933 2018-01-05 22:56:27 The future is now... Ask your crypto questions... #crypto #bitcoin #inventing #investing #Changing #lives
934 2018-01-05 22:56:25 Which is a great start! But they still haven’t announced anything haha just more “we’ll make an announcement soon” stuff from the Devs in the discord

953 2018-01-05 22:55:14 Do you all realize the Ripplepay peer to peer was invented in 2004. 4 years before bitcoin. Go look at the historical snapshot on CMC for 2014. Where do you see Ripple? #2 spot. XRP was created to capitalize off of BTC. Centralized XRP is Ripple!  Not crypto
954 2018-01-05 22:55:12 I’m with you! And verge
955 2018-01-05 22:55:10 独身で引き篭もり気味の人は仮想通貨でボロ儲けしてもなぜか毎日が妙に虚しくて、日々ストロング・ゼロを1日中煽りながら肝臓悪くして、せっかく稼いだのに早く逝ってしまいそう
956 2018-01-05 22:55:07 Bro don't throw .5btc around and then ask if it will double. Why did you take the decision? Did you do your own research? And yes, it will double.
957 2018-01-05 22:55:04 My comment was more so for the crypto currency as a solution. Reality is it's not stable enough or understood enough by most to operate invest money into it. I mean general public or private investors that may not be familiar
958 2018-01-05 22:55:00 Waiting for moon visit :D still holding, patience always win the race slow n steady
959 2018-01-05 22:55:00 It was current performance, #tron was up 150% in 24 hour. #xvg up 30% and #etn was stable not doing a lot, although it's now up 20%. You're a translator between traditional finance and crypto? So you already get what rocket and moon means yes?
960 2018-01-05 22:54:59 #Bytecoin 120% in a day without the need to drag @officialmcafee 's name in the mud... Contrary to scamcoin #xvg
961 2018-01-05 22:54:51 There’s amazing deals still out there right now in terms of short term profit!

Everytime the ALTs drop due to Bitcoin, they rise higher than before!

$TRX hit 2047sats yesterday and is still at 1200.. GREAT BUY!

$CND was at 1329sats yesterday and is still at 900.. GREAT BUY!
962 2018-01-05 22:54:51 That or make it a super easy crypto called free-coin or sand
963 2018-01-05 22:54:48 1/ Often I show smart people the numbers we are finding on crypto returns and they dismiss it

It is interesting to see the reactions. 

Probably not worth my time to try to convince people.
964 2018-01-05 22:54:46 LMAO is this a joke 
965 2018-01-05 22:54:45 RIP you're poor now

982 2018-01-05 22:53:21 Uh huh... and your point is? 
Noticed you like to FUD a lot.
Keep up the good work. You're doing a better job of bringing #xrpthestandard into the public view with your FUD.
983 2018-01-05 22:53:17 I have a buddy who knows nothing about the crypto-sphere and threw money at ripple because “it looked like it would go up.”

That was back around .30¢, needless to say he feels validated by his luck. Good for him, but I dislike when people try to make it seem like they “knew it”.

997 2018-01-05 22:52:34 Exactly, good entries make you not have to worry. All these know it all traders think if you switch to Bitcoin you'll buy alts back at a higher price.
998 2018-01-05 22:52:34 We will have an article coming out next week and a github repo popping up soon! This is a trustless design on the relay network I proposed a few weeks ago.

1001 2018-01-05 22:52:26 If you are simply saying that the valuation doesn’t correlate to revenue or profit you are correct. However find me one valuation in crypto that does.  But at least Ripple|XRP has a use case and is actively transacting XRP and will be transacting more in 2018.
1002 2018-01-05 22:52:14 I had an incredibly long wait on a different asset withdrawal from bittrex recently too....the surge in crypto demand can't be helping but do you really think it's Daedalus fault? It very well could be I'm just saying I've recently had issues with non-ADA withdrawals
1003 2018-01-05 22:52:06 Funny, yesterday I head that people who drink gin & tonics are most likely to be psychopaths. I use to drink a ton of them. I now drink IPA's. Sometimes double IPAs.

1005 2018-01-05 22:51:57 Someone pointed out that you'd suggested someone should make short YouTube videos explaining policy issues.

1012 2018-01-05 22:51:32 Not for me. I don’t buy gold and have never bought gold. I’m not interested in it. Crypto provides me with a ton of value.....Easy to transport, secure, and untouchable by oppressive governments or other third parties.  Plus gold is heavy.
1013 2018-01-05 22:51:28 "Crypto confessions".
I don't think anyone didn't make any mistakes today.
I was able to reduce the damage, but boy did I make mistakes.
I've definitely overtraded and didn't expect "the corn" to be this strong.
1014 2018-01-05 22:51:28 So if #Bitcoin has become the gold of the crypto space I guess we‘re looking for the next no. 1 payment platform.

#XRP is currently experiencing a correction (happens to every coin)
#BTC was inevitably going to increase again after the New Year

Both will increase hugely in value long-term. #HODL
#Bitcoin #Ripple @ripple #cryptocurrency #investing
1055 2018-01-05 22:48:46 This is HORRIBLE reporting. The dip was because $BTC went up over $1k and the “jump” was during $BTC consolidation. Learn crypto before reporting.

1075 2018-01-05 22:47:24 You're my favorite crypto dude Trav, biggups.
1076 2018-01-05 22:47:15 What makes crypto unique from the Dot Com era is the ease of entry for investment (speculation) and ease of liquidity. No longer are companies open to investment groups, and no longer do you have to wait for a liquidity event (acquisition, IPO).
1077 2018-01-05 22:47:03 Be mindful guys he could be saying this just to get our guys to invest so the value increases and he can sell his xrv at your FOMO expense. Do your own research, make o it as you will, he is a clever man that knows how to manipulate your psychological responses.

1079 2018-01-05 22:47:01 Someone needs to develop stream alerts for crypto currency donations.
1080 2018-01-05 22:47:00 I have all crypto on ledger nano, so not sure how anyone will ever know till I spend it or convert back to fiat.

1087 2018-01-05 22:46:28 No chance
1088 2018-01-05 22:46:28 Traditional financial reporters are the WORST crypto reporters. $ALT did not “jump” because of X rumor today. It was because $BTC took a break midway during a bull run #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #news
1089 2018-01-05 22:46:25 I strongly recommend buying $kmd $vtc at these levels. When #bittrex reopens to new users the vol spike is going to be redic.

1092 2018-01-05 22:46:11 As much as I want $XVG to succeed, I don’t feel comfortable recommending anyone to buy it until something is announced from the Verge team itself and not the HODLers! Lots of talk but still a lot of drama  I still have my bag of XVG and I’ll continue to HODL on! #XVG
1093 2018-01-05 22:45:56 Yeah I am, starting this evening haha
1094 2018-01-05 22:45:55 I realised today that the crypto trading tips I’ve been giving to my friends could really benefit a larger audience. Will definitely be posting more, however I still and will always recommend that you do your own research before investing. #cryptocurrencies #trading
1095 2018-01-05 22:45:49 Anything under a dollar is up. Cause new people think they are cheap. We have a ton of people in this space now that don't have a clue what crypto is.
1096 2018-01-05 22:45:48 IMPORTANT NOTICE: Wagerr withdrawals are temporarily suspended, until we are certain that the Intel "meltdown" and "spectre" vulnerabilities are patched. Thanks for your cooperation. #Wagerr #BeTheHouse #Cryptocurrency #Crypto
1097 2018-01-05 22:45:44 Thank you for tweets like this that reassure me today, on my alt hodl's.
1098 2018-01-05 22:45:44 OK as someone paper free since 1994, and never owner a printer,  does my cybredust agenda turn to crypto gold or pixie dust poor? #greentrees #words are the ultimate renewable resource. :)
1099 2018-01-05 22:45:39 That’s not how markets work
1100 2018-01-05 22:45:37 I use the official wallet for each crypto...! Desktop
1101 2018-01-05 22:45:36 I would add: be wary of every one dispensing crypto trading advice.
1102 2018-01-05 22:45:36 the crypto god
1103 2018-01-05 22:45:33 never that, new to crypto but not to a check boy gtfo my line haha noob deez nuts foo
1104 2018-01-05 22:45:33 Make a TRX/LTC pairing on the exchanges and let inflows and out flows talk for themselves.
1105 2018-01-05 22:45:29 Then those "everyone" are only on crypto for 2 months. There was a warning 2 days ago^^ bots warned in bittrex.
1106 2018-01-05 22:45:27 $SC to 2000 sats valid! Go for it! now it is $SC turn!
1107 2018-01-05 22:45:25 A lot longer when they throttle down the gas, enjoy higher fees due to rising prices, and maximise their margins as a result.  Cowboys
1108 2018-01-05 22:45:24 I'm going to create a crypto currency called "Caffeine." The name for the coin will be called CUP, as in a cup of coffee. The currency won't do anything at all, but I'll post big words and logos of major companies that you all recognize to gain your trust in the project.
1109 2018-01-05 22:45:20 If you normalize the supply of XRP down to 21 million, it turns out that the XRP price surpassed BTC by 5% and more  #crypto #xrp
1110 2018-01-05 22:45:09 It's called HYPOCRISY!
1111 2018-01-05 22:45:09 Yes.
1112 2018-01-05 22:45:05 You can make more money with Crypto than gambling on CSGO Sites.

1115 2018-01-05 22:45:01 Don't worry, I work for a living.  Would never buy a crypto, even a @maxkeiser coin!  When the Feds start shutting down these schemes, I will pray for you....
1116 2018-01-05 22:44:57 OPPOSITE #Crypto actions: #Bitcoin once again surpasses $17,000 (up 12% today). #Ripple in reverse as XRP is at $2.51 (-11% today). @Coinbase #Coinbase #CryptoCurrencies
1117 2018-01-05 22:44:56 I love you Haejin!
1118 2018-01-05 22:44:54 A day after Bitconnect gets hit with a cease and desist there are reports that USI Tech is shutting down in the U.S and Canada
1119 2018-01-05 22:44:49 News flash: big banks are NOT going away... ever. The cashless society mavens/crypto disciples will wail and gnash their teeth when they finally accept this fact. Fiat and crypto will live side by side and serve purposes specific to each. One will not supplant the other...
1120 2018-01-05 22:44:41 A través de quién operas las crypto?
1121 2018-01-05 22:44:41 And you own your data!!!!
1122 2018-01-05 22:44:37 crypto is gamified retirement planning.
1123 2018-01-05 22:44:37 Ha ha, people still give you shit fir exit all crypto, but it actually was a good call, but i doubt few had the discipline to not buy 'cheap alts'
1124 2018-01-05 22:44:33 Just call out the worst person on your feed and encourage everyone to unfollow them instead
1125 2018-01-05 22:44:31 Gonna talk crypto or just bitcoin?
1126 2018-01-05 22:44:29 Surprised there aren't more crypto watchers/notifiers on @IFTTT.
1127 2018-01-05 22:44:26 I did my own research and only then invested in bezop because it really has potential and serious people are behind it so we will see how that goes, but last ico that he mentioned (Fina thing) that ico looks fishy

1139 2018-01-05 22:43:18 Did you see me downplaying $SONM somewhere? It’s a great project.
I’m just crushing your flawed opinion that $GNT = marketing, which is a lie.
You avoiding my argument proves that.

1142 2018-01-05 22:43:02 Umm so why not buy gold or gold derivatives? It at least has actual real world value and a purpose. Crypto is nothing more than the worlds most expensive accounting software.
1143 2018-01-05 22:42:50 I need that #CryptoCurrencies #breakingnews

1146 2018-01-05 22:42:46 They did not have a licence to trade securities guys. Other countries don’t consider their mlm product a security. Thus the issue.
1147 2018-01-05 22:42:39 You’re shorting xrp? How?
1148 2018-01-05 22:42:33 Perhaps you should try zooming out on your chart
1149 2018-01-05 22:42:33 Yeah, that looks legit.. not ..at all.
1150 2018-01-05 22:42:25 What concerns me about all crypto is market cap to replacement cost. For example to replace/mimic #BTC you need to have the mining capacity (distributed) which would cost 2.75B at today's equipment prices. Market Cap is over 100x this number. Is this a valid concern?
1151 2018-01-05 22:42:24  White People Pay Black Water All the Time. Ppl on the Dark Web Using Crypto Can Donate to Our Cause. Sea ??
1152 2018-01-05 22:42:18 That’s quite a parry. They are no where near overcoming any of those obstacles. Give evidence of such a meaningless statement.
1153 2018-01-05 22:42:12 I can’t say I understand it either fully but I jumped into Crypto 3 months ago. It’s ....surreal. And has been worthwhile to say the least.  Good to see you!
1154 2018-01-05 22:42:12 えっぐい落ち方してますね。。
1155 2018-01-05 22:42:09 Thank god, hope you'll set a trend

1159 2018-01-05 22:42:01 He did a 4 month projection on a coin and was spot on.      He looks for the positive trends that generally would take off if they meet the criteria, thats why it seems like its everything to the moon.
1160 2018-01-05 22:41:54 I actually found her tweet very informative, though I do have a few questions.
How would you quantify 3 rockets and a moon versus 1 rocket?
Should I short the turtle or is that an "underperform" rating?
Can you share your backup on the 1 rocket? I'd like to dig through the model.

1177 2018-01-05 22:40:41 I had at least 200 crypto trades in 2017 and none of the platforms I used offer transaction history data. I have to just guess my taxes apparently 
1178 2018-01-05 22:40:35 QUOLNEX使い辛いってやたらと見るし、私も最初は分からなかったのですが、慣れたら楽です。

Binanceは使いやすいので、ああいう画面も用意できれば最高かと。
1179 2018-01-05 22:40:30 I guess I’m a quality insight on crypto and alt coins now lmao
1180 2018-01-05 22:40:26 I've my first copy (the later issue) and have shared with my friends of crypto.. Got an amazing feedback.. And the feedback was "sold! One place to go for research!!"
1181 2018-01-05 22:40:25 The rich get richer and the poor get poorer! Financial assets becoming more expensive as more money pours in and the lower wages stay the same, resulting in a hurdle for the big masses to acquire financial assets. 

$crypto is the answer in providing opportunity for everybody!
1182 2018-01-05 22:40:23 lmao. 
1183 2018-01-05 22:40:18 @OzCryptoHodler Hi, when u gonna annnounce the winner for 10000 trx... ?? Hopefully, I get it. I was new to crypto market so bought verge first on 31st night but it came down on 1st and I lost my money. Praying to god that I get it.
1184 2018-01-05 22:40:15 @brian_armstrong wouldnt be a bad idea to start doing some experiential marketing and connecting with the culture to show the importance of crypto at a grassroots level. Let @Limitless_CC pitch. www.limitlesscreativeco.coim  #LimitlessCreativeCo

1198 2018-01-05 22:39:09 Those XRPs are just being traded on the crypto-exchanges at spot values to trade for FIAT to make a payment.  It doesn't speak to the tech at all, you can do that with any crypto coin.

1214 2018-01-05 22:38:06 This is why I nearly always scalp 10%-20% off the top of coins after a large Rally, especially when the BTC surge was seen coming a mile away. Hesitations and second guesses aren't just bad when taking your S.A.T's. W Crypto always being prepared is a must.

1220 2018-01-05 22:37:45 One Canadian to another. How you feeling about iota ?
1221 2018-01-05 22:37:45 I agree. Just a huge rumor. I’ve also heard the same for ripple. Can’t believe it until actual evidence is there
1222 2018-01-05 22:37:40 100 JPY(BTC): 1317.098 ~ 1318.332 KRW(BTC)
1223 2018-01-05 22:37:38 Could you please do an update on Ripple?
1224 2018-01-05 22:37:37 Xrp. Even though I'm new to crypto it's just doesn't feel right after researching it more.
1225 2018-01-05 22:37:27 Just one for me trying to bring bitcoin to the masses over in lil old ireland

1239 2018-01-05 22:36:25 Do one with a small description as to why. Far better than an indiscriminate listen anyway.
1240 2018-01-05 22:36:11 I see value in original purchase date and last purchase date per crypto. Or at least a trade history with light weight filtering.
1241 2018-01-05 22:36:09 Oh, alright I guess that makes sense. I am a Traumatic Brain Injury Survivor and I will also admit that I havent a clue what I am doing as far as cryptocurrencies go.
The "Brain Damage" is permanant sadly but hopefully I can gain more knowledge about crypto over time!

1245 2018-01-05 22:36:02 @jimcramer Thoughts on the crypto Request Network?
1246 2018-01-05 22:35:59 いつも楽しみにみていますよー！疲れる時期ですかね…？
1247 2018-01-05 22:35:50 You clearly have no clue what a ponzi is. Crypto could be in a bubble (it most likely is), that doesn't make it a ponzi though.
1248 2018-01-05 22:35:44 I didnt say you were stupid for using the product,I said they were stupid for only using crypto rather than also having a fiat card.  i too use a btc debit card HOWEVER i also have a fiat debit card for daily spending as its just easier and you run into less problems.
1249 2018-01-05 22:35:38 3/  This is what conceptually happened in the housing bubble.  The distinction I’m making with crypto being a speculative frenzy, and not a bubble, is at least for now, money is still changing hands (for the most part) and we still have zero sum game.
1250 2018-01-05 22:35:17 “Pump and dump scams are starting to hit crypto currencies” Well no fuckin shit chief, you’re trading something with no underlying value in a completely unregulated market, you’re expecting people to “play fair”???
1251 2018-01-05 22:35:09 God i cant waitttt
1252 2018-01-05 22:35:03 I like the idea, just a thought I had, the current view is classing IOTA as MIOTA right? Which means per million units compared to each other crypto's 1 unit.
I'd like to see it if it was to all the same unit of measure.
1253 2018-01-05 22:35:03 Try Delta
1254 2018-01-05 22:35:01 So does Crypto-Bridge BCO compete with BTS? 

Or is there some reason to use BTS on the Crypto-Bridge platform?

1256 2018-01-05 22:34:52 What's the point of doing that?
1257 2018-01-05 22:34:46 Why? Doesnt it work?

1261 2018-01-05 22:34:33 I'm a CPA & a tax preparer. the IRS treats crypto currency like any other stock. Any gains from sale of your Crypo currency is taxed as a capital asset Just pay the tax, it's not worth the risk. IRS already obtaining records from coinbase.

1266 2018-01-05 22:34:22 Actually without coinbase. Let's wait when banks start lining up to adopt Ripple/XRP, which is more the real thing. Fyi, Coinbase KILLER is born, it's called ETHOS. Check it out ;-)
1267 2018-01-05 22:34:21 which bank`?
1268 2018-01-05 22:34:13 It's not surprising crypto is a direct threat to traditional banks. Why would they cooperate in their own destruction.

1291 2018-01-05 22:32:53 It's circulation will reach full capacity in 55 months. In 5 years, the crypto market will be much larger, and if things go as planned, there'll be a lot of #xrapid adoption. Each ripple transaction also burns some #xrp . It's a well thought out control mechanism.
1292 2018-01-05 22:32:51 Hodling is definitely due to laziness in my personal case (setting stops or market selling for a hundred shitcoins could take ages, could maybe make sense only for big bags). Nonetheless have to say my polo mostly alt pf stood steadily in usd value!

1296 2018-01-05 22:32:36 Some of us genuinely think no crypto is “decentralized,” and we’d rather have Ethereum-style centralization (high node costs, shaky PoS), than have Bitcoin’s (mining, Core devs, high tx fees).
1297 2018-01-05 22:32:36 Did you invest USD or use another crypto to buy into it?
1298 2018-01-05 22:32:35 Crypto gurus are fighting on my WhatsApp.
1299 2018-01-05 22:32:30 It’s  frozen there could be a dump in the mean time but checking the price online it’s still rising
1300 2018-01-05 22:32:21 I guess 80% of ppl here knows this is not going above 23-25 cents for the next 2-3 months(or more) The problem here is lack of comm..responsible ones are quiet and the "hopeful" ones are the one doing all the talking 
1301 2018-01-05 22:32:21 Well deserved man, thanks for the shout!
1302 2018-01-05 22:32:19 Good list, no crypto yet?
1303 2018-01-05 22:32:16 One more thing that definitely has to be discussed....how bitcoin and crypto have acted as great store of value mechanisms for the wealthy in struggling or crumbling governments....like it did in Cyprus back in 2011 and In Greece a few years later.....and Zimbabwe just recently
1304 2018-01-05 22:32:14 I cant believe that people take him seriously when it comes to crypto. just a year or two ago he was claiming he could decrypt an ios device without a backdoor, then saying "haha that was just a publicity stunt". anyone that believes whatever this guy says is nuts :|. woof.

1308 2018-01-05 22:32:03 I might have to start calling Litecoin “Shycoin”, the little guy keeps poking his head up to have a look and then quickly retreats back to hide from the shitcoins 
1309 2018-01-05 22:31:53 I think we've gone orthogonal bro  maybe 
(Not disagreeing with anything you said) my point was more about understanding fundamentals for new people rushing in (especially on the crypto side)

1314 2018-01-05 22:31:27 Some will, others will buy up. #bitcoin will likely go up further, specially with the tether printing that's going on. But the higher it goes, the harder it is to provide the same levels of return. A rising tide lifts all boats, and making crypto market bigger isn't a bad thing.

1317 2018-01-05 22:31:18 A goal for 2018: Limit time spent living and breathing crypto. Quality research over quantity
1318 2018-01-05 22:31:16 ROFLOL, what do you think of a target from 200 sats? That’s extremely high for XVG. You know what it cost to mine Verge? Less then 100 sats.

1341 2018-01-05 22:29:38 why not? Personally I agree it's totally against the ethos of crypto like you say, but from a trading POV that doesn't mean I will never long or short it. Where is the line between what is against the ethos and what isn't? In $xrp's case it's clear but with others? quite grey
1342 2018-01-05 22:29:38 Another interesting conversation could be about the different protocols used in crypto. For example, proof of work vs proof of stake and how they fit in our automated, robotized future. If you would like some more ideas, let me know. I love this stuff.
1343 2018-01-05 22:29:35 Обращайтесь
1344 2018-01-05 22:29:34 All this FUD is of course entirely unecessary. There will be no single winner in crypto currency. Any fool who thinks there will be one coin to rule them all should probably find something else to spend their time on.

Different projects have different valid goals. #XRP #BTC #ETH
1345 2018-01-05 22:29:34 ok thanks got that. but now it's too late I have them in my balance. Can you tell us why ?

1360 2018-01-05 22:28:40 @JonsandmanTv hey man watching your cleaning crate closet video, I want you to get the wonderments. I think I have a couple Xmas crates you can have, I don’t open crates unless I get crypto keys so I can’t trade the items anyway.
1361 2018-01-05 22:28:35 It's better than gold. This is Crypto . Taking this knowledge to the moon 
1362 2018-01-05 22:28:34 You forgot to mention Marquis. He ruined it the most.
1363 2018-01-05 22:28:33 
1364 2018-01-05 22:28:31 what about Stronghands will it grow and is there any utility of this coin ?
1365 2018-01-05 22:28:26 this is really helpful, thanks.
1366 2018-01-05 22:28:19 VERGE is taking off. #VergeCoin #Crypto #cryptocurrency #verge #VergeFam
1367 2018-01-05 22:28:18 Get $XLM on there, I could use the advertisement, HAHA I'm down 50k on it!
1368 2018-01-05 22:28:12 Why would a bank want to hold a low value asset on their balance sheet. Wouldn’t they want that asset to have a high value, great for shareholders, security, liquidity and if used in a transaction, fewer required, less friction, cheaper.
1369 2018-01-05 22:28:10 Si vi que ese es el target muy pronto.
1370 2018-01-05 22:27:55 Hardly, just preying in the uninformed
1371 2018-01-05 22:27:54 This is great
1372 2018-01-05 22:27:42 @crypto_bobby Would love to hear you talk on the podcast about indexing as a long-term strategy. Recreating a Top 10 portfolio, % according to market cap with regular rebalancing.
1373 2018-01-05 22:27:39 Just be aware some #altcoins are going to dump and stay dumped, so make smart choices when you're buying.

Here are a few of my picks :

$NEO $DBC $AION
$LSK $MIOTA $SUB
$OMG $PRL
$KMD $ICX
$DGB $KCS

1375 2018-01-05 22:27:28 I could be wrong too, but BCH should be able to scale based on gigablock tests and the low cost of hard drives doesn't stop from accommodating massive blocks. Blocks can hold tens of thousands of tx, even just at 8MB.

1377 2018-01-05 22:27:18 Can you review or revise about BTC/MCO @Haejin_Crypto 

thanks a lot
1378 2018-01-05 22:27:16 And how will we be sure we get everything back??

1381 2018-01-05 22:27:02 For some of us, crypto is more than just investment...
1382 2018-01-05 22:26:58 We are going to trade it not marry it
1383 2018-01-05 22:26:57 Lol
1384 2018-01-05 22:26:55 LOVE Litecoin.  Fast, cheap, and now becoming a main currency pair on many exchanges.  It's my go to, to move funds.
1385 2018-01-05 22:26:52 Truth be told Commies have figured out that another year or two and bitcoiners would be leading the revolution that wipes away the Commie menace. Would take back all my doubts about crypto v 1.0 (just because new versions will keep coming) if that happens!
1386 2018-01-05 22:26:44 Since the banks use the capital stored by it’s clients to fuel loans and such, by cutting access to stored wealth, the financial industry’s absurd profits are threatened!  Instead, crypto is now allowing for P2P lending mechanisms thus replacing that bank function.
1387 2018-01-05 22:26:37 #Kin will explode

Buy now while its under the radar

1388 2018-01-05 22:26:32 No, but I got Bitcoin : )

1390 2018-01-05 22:26:24 Master Sensei Haejin
1391 2018-01-05 22:26:21 Dogma and ideology in crypto prevents so many from understanding that #BTC #ETH and #XRP are complimentary to one another not cannibalistic. #cryptocurrency #blockchain #bitcoin #Ethereum #Ripple #coinbase
1392 2018-01-05 22:26:19 Getting into crypto, I spent so much time trying to learn and use so many different indicators and neglecting the basics. After realizing this, and sticking to basic lines, my results improved noticeably. It’s true what they say about all the “noise”
1393 2018-01-05 22:26:19 Next to buy crypto is $Fun (FunFair)
It will launch sooner or later! In one week it went +136%. I tripled my buy!
#FunFair #crypto #makeitlaunch #MakeItHappen
1394 2018-01-05 22:26:16 Lots of promising #ICOs in the next weeks. Due to $ETH and $NEO price increase and current hype, it is becoming quite hard to participate in the better ones. @experty_io is a cool app that has a low hard cap, a real use token and it is still open for registration. #crypto $BTC
1395 2018-01-05 22:26:14 LOL ;-)
1396 2018-01-05 22:26:13 
1397 2018-01-05 22:26:10 Yeahhhhh go TRX
1398 2018-01-05 22:26:09 ICOs are not on the markets, so their price can't be manipulated with his posts.... Most of good ICOs can give you 5x , 10x or even more return on investment, of course if that project is good one with serious people behind it. Bezop has potential so we will see ROI on investment
1399 2018-01-05 22:26:04 using webMD is like using twitter for crypto advice. there is no medium ground. its either mooning or a shit coin. LOL
1400 2018-01-05 22:26:04 Hoping $pasc gets back into green after this 2 day lull. I have high hopes for this, especially long term
1401 2018-01-05 22:25:54 今のtriggerの暴落なんですか？
100分の1に一瞬なった。
1402 2018-01-05 22:25:43 tru, a word for me from a old gipsy , ''if we work , when we gonna make money '', specialy when crypto world os so addictive,ful of addrenaline and thriling like a action movie
1403 2018-01-05 22:25:36 I’ve been invested in ethereum for 36 hours now and still not a millionaire? Crypto isn’t the future
1404 2018-01-05 22:25:30 $DADI will be shilled to the moon, no doubt... at all...
1405 2018-01-05 22:25:28 Right. So that implies a low value for XRP even if banks adopt xRapid. There’s no need or desire for banks to hold XRP, no? (I’m currently bullish on Ripple the company but bearish on XRP the token, open to being wrong)
1406 2018-01-05 22:25:26 Someone's going make a lot of money out of these lamps. Other people are going to make an obscene amount off @SubstratumNet & the Substrate Token.
1407 2018-01-05 22:25:25 HEAT 3/4 - If Facebook integrate an established crypto into their ecosystem which of the following is it most likely to be? $BTC $LTC $DASH $DCR $XRP $XMR $XVG $XEM $ZEC $BCH $XVG $ETN $ETH $DOGE $VTC
1408 2018-01-05 22:25:24 Paccoin volume more than good, circulation facility, on the high side. Market cap looks promising. Stand on coin marketing is very nice. $PAC
1409 2018-01-05 22:25:12 Also talk about how you know if a crypto currency is worth investing in
1410 2018-01-05 22:25:09 We XRPers care less if you join our "cult"! You want to miss the train, it's your choice... don't ever lament it ;-)
1411 2018-01-05 22:25:09 @StockShorts
1412 2018-01-05 22:25:08 ですよね、ブロックチェーンに胸をときめかせていた頃が既になつかしく感じます(^^;ただ、このお祭り騒ぎも時間の問題でしょうから、必要とされるものが整理整頓されるまで、今しばらく高みの見物といきましょう(^^)
1413 2018-01-05 22:25:02 New to crypto.  1000 of any would be a great addition to the few I have.  Thanks
1414 2018-01-05 22:24:59 I know it’s been off the radar a lil’ bit then boom!  
1415 2018-01-05 22:24:57 It is happening now m8 just enjoy
1416 2018-01-05 22:24:57 ¿Alguna empresa u organización que esté experimentando con #blockchain en #México (que no sean plataformas de intercambio de crypto) 
1417 2018-01-05 22:24:55 Tron is the biggest scam I've seen recently, look for yourself in the whitepaper it's all nonsensical... "star wars, moon landing, voyager, metacholrians, Zach Braff,
Literally nonsense in the white paper, on top of that he holds over one third of all trx tokens.. lol
1418 2018-01-05 22:24:54 @BittrexExchange is delisting $TRIG and withdrawal fee is 5TRIG: 25$ now, 50$ not long ago.
1419 2018-01-05 22:24:51 You mean mentor...lol
1420 2018-01-05 22:24:49 $wtc, $mtl?
1421 2018-01-05 22:24:49 It’s such a vast and fascinating topic!  You could discuss hyperbitcoinization and how it threatens the current banking system by removing capital from bank controlled channels!  A millennial that keeps his wealth in crypto prevents banks from benefiting directly from his wealth.
1422 2018-01-05 22:24:46 what is this BAT - the #BAT would refer to basic attention token, - currently $.60 not BATcoin which you are referring to. I couldnt find any info on it, im interested!
1423 2018-01-05 22:24:44 Edit: meant vericoin.

It's cool to see platforms getting setup, not sure if I want their chuckycheesebucks though. 

Sha256 with massive hashing power is the most secure due2 equip rather than wallet and less apathy due to better incentives through rewards and entrep.
1424 2018-01-05 22:24:41 THE ASSAULT ON CRYPTO CURRENCY IS UNDERWAY
- peace -

1425 2018-01-05 22:24:39 I have never lost hope on Verge,  just look on Justin and all the hard work and dedication he puts into it.  And that interview he had about privacy coins when he asked another guy directly about tracking its users...  He got me then.  So much FUD - #XVG #NextBitcoin
1426 2018-01-05 22:24:36 If you could look past mcafee, he hyped tron, coulda took a 30 percent loss on verge, quadrupled everything on tron, shorted verge again...trusted mcafee though..
1427 2018-01-05 22:24:32 ２ちゃんでそういうコピペあったね！
1428 2018-01-05 22:24:27 Here is my take on Visa's rejection on crypto associated Cards. Crypto must come together to create their own bank cards with low $0 fees to compete. Its competition, you had to expect this. I'm not mad at them for it. Crypto leaders must solve this.
1429 2018-01-05 22:24:20 $XRP pumped by banks to record heights, @Visa terminating half of Bitcoin cards... They are coming for us, 2018 is the year they want to bury or domesticate crypto. First thing to do right now is HODL like hell.
1430 2018-01-05 22:24:19 um no, @BKBrianKelly

1441 2018-01-05 22:23:45 Nope. BCO to Crypto-Bridge is like Obits to Openledger. Both separate gateways on the bts blockchain and they have their own tokens.
1442 2018-01-05 22:23:43 HEAT 2/4 - If Facebook integrate an established crypto into their ecosystem which of the following is it most likely to be? $BTC $LTC $DASH $DCR $XRP $XMR $XVG $XEM $ZEC $BCH $XVG $ETN
1443 2018-01-05 22:23:37 There is an option to withdraw it from the wallet and I'm trying to send it over to Bittrex that has a wallet to receive it so I habe to assume it's just like any other currency on their sites.
1444 2018-01-05 22:23:35 Crypto currencies don’t need Mark to reach 1 trillion. It would be much more than a trillion
1445 2018-01-05 22:23:33 Whats is BK?
1446 2018-01-05 22:23:19 just because they ask for my records doesn't mean I'll give it to them  Income taxes are essentially voluntary. most americans just are oblivious to that fact
1447 2018-01-05 22:23:03 This market is becoming by day full of scammers and pricks who try their best to get as much influence and money in this new Crypto hyped world. Really sad to see.
1448 2018-01-05 22:22:56 I suspect a continuation of parabolic crypto adoption.

1452 2018-01-05 22:22:47 PSA: if your bank goes insolvent, they are legally allowed to take money out of your accounts in the US? Deposits are considered liabilities according to US Banking Law and depositors are creditors. Thanks #DoddFrank #bailin is the new bailout @OptOutOfFiat and opt in to crypto

1460 2018-01-05 22:21:53 Of course lol. Depends what you want from the currency; a coin that pumps & dumps to make a quick buck or one that utilises the platform, becomes a game changer & leads the way. I couldn't care how much is apparently put away. They're never going to dump it in & crash the market.

1465 2018-01-05 22:21:48 @Haejin_Crypto calls for #xvg #verge to boom within hours People doubt this claim cuz of recent qwaks with xvg management. Honestly I stand with @Haejin_Crypto on this. No matter @vergecurrency peticular management/comunication style, the coin s wayyy too undervaluated right now
1466 2018-01-05 22:21:48 what do you think of DGB's current value ?

1468 2018-01-05 22:21:44 Crypto gamblers go full retard, throw their money at the Ripple bag of lies and deceit, ignoring reality and common sense. The dream of 10x per month returns is stronger than reality. We're reaching levels of stupidity deemed impossible until now.
1469 2018-01-05 22:21:42 I can understand why there's so many misconceptions and misleading information being passed around about not only #XRP and @Ripple but other projects as well. The #BTC / #ETH space is full of overexposed nervous people with poor understanding of crypto tech (and it's politics).
1470 2018-01-05 22:21:42 BTC_LTC price DECREASED to $0.014500 on #poloniex. New alerts (+/- 4.000 pct) set at: UP: $0.015080 - DOWN: $0.013920 $ltc #ltc #litecoin #moon TEST PERIOD #crypto $crypto $btc

1472 2018-01-05 22:21:41 I'm actually really optimistic for this $BTC bull run. It will bring most #alts into their realistic price range, which will make trading much less risky as the volatility will level off. 1/2

1490 2018-01-05 22:20:47 Funny how there's a notion propagated throughout world of crypto that SoV/Currency is an either or.

In actuality, reliable currencies are by default a great SoV. The idea that it can only be one of the two is a myth.

#BitcoinCash is currency and therefore a store of value. #BCH
1491 2018-01-05 22:20:46 look into cardano xlm those have been pretty solid but be on the look out. 
Best wishes to you on your new crypto journey. never get to greedy it will come and bite you in the butt.
1492 2018-01-05 22:20:42 $trx will be in top three in this year.

After many users have experienced dubious ETH withdrawal delays by exchanges such as #Coinbase and #Binance, cashing in on the higher fees, its actually nice to be able to praise a #cryptocurrency platform that really does what it says it does.
1499 2018-01-05 22:20:15 It feels like there’s a lot of gaming of the little guys in crypto.
1500 2018-01-05 22:20:14 Do you get to see @AlanKohler's daily crypto updates on @abcnews ? So many graphs comparing it to previous bubbles.
1501 2018-01-05 22:20:09 Three months ago, Tron's price was hovering in the range of $98 Million, which means the currency has risen 100 times in just onw quater. #Tron #trx #crypto

1503 2018-01-05 22:20:00 Attack? You can't attack my master sensei. Resistance is futile.
1504 2018-01-05 22:19:52 If anything, I'd argue the opposite. Currency cannot effectively function as a medium of exchange unless it's a good store of value, which is partly why crypto is so awkward to transact with- it's value changes literally every few seconds.

1512 2018-01-05 22:19:16 You know Bobby? Buy XRP and shut up... you'll thank me later ;-)
1513 2018-01-05 22:19:13 Omg yes. I'm so sick of people telling me "you never know with crypto" when I answer them that XRP will never possibly be worth $5000
1514 2018-01-05 22:19:13 just received a text from my mother "What is a ripple? have you heard of it?" Unsure if this is the prime indicator to buy or sell.. #XRP #crypto

1520 2018-01-05 22:18:55 FYI, I have dumped all my Ripple and will not invest in it from this point on. Centralized system run by banks and ability to freeze account is totally against the ethos of crypto.

1523 2018-01-05 22:18:40 And . . . In technical analysis weeklies, monthlies and yearlys count more than dailies. But with crypto, not enough price history for that so gotta keep tight stops
1524 2018-01-05 22:18:31 It’s a different use case. But then again crypto was never meant to be slow and expensive digital currency transactions ie bitcoin. It’s evolving.

1533 2018-01-05 22:18:02 Well thats what the crypto market works on, sentiment. Why do you think it's so volatile?
1534 2018-01-05 22:17:58 That's wrong. It's 2am PST
1535 2018-01-05 22:17:56 And $RPX!

1537 2018-01-05 22:17:45 You understand nothing about the tech or the company and that’s apparent. And you have no clue how long anyone posting on here has held crypto so that statement in general just shows your stupidity.

1575 2018-01-05 22:15:59 People need to see banks will adopt blockchain technology, not crypto coins that are on the market. Ripple technology, though not bad, is by no mean best and perfect technology as of right now and in the future. No testing sadly has been successful to date.

1577 2018-01-05 22:15:49 Hahah necromancy, I like it. No a combo of researching their security, supply, volume, transactions, team, marketing, TA, and culture. Skywire is cool, but skycoin security is suspect, and supply seems rather vague and unbounded/easily, modded by devs.
1578 2018-01-05 22:15:48 it is clear, confesses in the bankers the owners of the world since the 19th century ... They are so fair!

1586 2018-01-05 22:15:04 I think without any dev explanations it will not rise. It seems to me still waiting same position. even if it continues like this, some of people will sell it because of disappointment . It can be decrease more then of 900 but anyway sooner or later i think it will increase.
1587 2018-01-05 22:14:57 Have you invested in crypto?

1594 2018-01-05 22:14:27 For my opinion you are the best crypto analyst in the place. But actually #reddcoin #rdd know major acceptance by market and fast growing. Many trader invest in RDD. This action have negative influence on XVG market. I think XVG will stay on resistance level or will down for 7day
1595 2018-01-05 22:14:21 Funny how the IRS wants us to keep every transaction for 3 years and yet they lost their receipts when throwing their million dollar parties with our “tax payer” money. #hypocrisy #hypocracy

1601 2018-01-05 22:14:01 Screenshot it and let’s revisit this later :)
1602 2018-01-05 22:13:58 It certainly is somewhat of a barrier to entry for someone who knows nothing about crypto. It took me some time researching to figure out the little that I do know now
1603 2018-01-05 22:13:57 #XLM was the first cryptocurrency I invested in. Bought in at .15, sold when it flattened out at .20 for some time. Not that I didn't trust the coin, I didn't trust my own research being new to crypto. Not x10 or x15 gains YET, but would have been a good starting investment.
1604 2018-01-05 22:13:50 That was a crappy thing to say ;)

1609 2018-01-05 22:13:20 i love the precedent this is setting - this is just another incentive for other big companies to start utilizing Ripple & $XRP

1611 2018-01-05 22:13:17 Are you still "not a fan" of $TRX?
1612 2018-01-05 22:13:12 I just bought some $NAS too. That team looks super solid.
1613 2018-01-05 22:13:08 Pick a few ogs and go back through a few months of tweets for ideas like I did a few weeks ago. Get in during consolidating and skim at the next resistance level. Or just hodl through alt season.  The crypto gawds very graciously rewarded me for my efforts.

1637 2018-01-05 22:11:45 When $BTC moves every fuckin coin bows down.
1638 2018-01-05 22:11:45 This is the dilemma #xvg will run into: when it gets clear stealth addresses with TOR are not as anonymous as claimed the devs will have to sacrifice other features (fast transaction, low fees) if they want to be a privacy coin. But then, well, now, it is too late :)
1639 2018-01-05 22:11:34 Revised list of crypto projects that are great to go long on: $QTUM, $ETH, $ZRX, $REP. You'll find that most of the highly shilled cryptocurrencies are short term plays and most likely scams and vaporware in the long run.
1640 2018-01-05 22:11:33 People need to calm down with this #xvg mooning claims on how it’s going to have a massive surge. Don’t get me wrong I am an avid supporter. And I would love that. But the bs is too much, don’t spoil this #crypto like @XVGWhale has. #hodl $XVG it’s long term investment!

1642 2018-01-05 22:11:30 Why cant you at least go to detail and ta lk about the coin. now bots are being set up to buy your picks immediately causing true visionaries and projects to lose value. THIS WILL RUIN CRYPTO ,YOU WILL RUIN CRYPTO , DECENTRALISED I AM A BIG FAN JUST THINK WRONG,DEFEAT PURPOSE
1643 2018-01-05 22:11:28 Zuckerberg's comments on decentralisation vs centralisation were really interesting! He was pretty supportive of #cryptocurrency might Facebook produce or form an alliance with a #crypto in the future?
1644 2018-01-05 22:11:25 Two very different products with some overlap. metamask does good stuff that Cryptonite doesn't do. Cryptonite will tell you when a crypto site is verified and therefore more likely to keep you safe from phishing scams. 

I recommend installing both.
1645 2018-01-05 22:11:23 おなしゃす！
1646 2018-01-05 22:11:21 Thank you! Feel like there are many more crypto stories still left to tell 
1647 2018-01-05 22:11:12 More and more people joining crypto and they will rather buy BTC then buy altS

1665 2018-01-05 22:10:16 There are select few people holding $Billions of $BTC each at this moment as well. Do you trust the intentions of those people? Will they dump them on the market at once someday? Have they locked up their BTC in escrow to assure you of this? What loyalty do they have to $BTC?

1672 2018-01-05 22:09:47 It amazes me how far crypto has came
1673 2018-01-05 22:09:42 Crypto will route around every central point of failure eventually. Maintaining consensus is hard at the best of times, maintaining it between a bunch of legacy rent seekers attempting to stifle a disruptive technology is impossible over the medium to long term.

1677 2018-01-05 22:09:37 yes sanders is a socialist, but to say that "socialism" is what got "the Bros" to feel "the bern" is fucking disingenuous, ignorant and frivolous

people liked sanders bc he was a populist that spoke to their issues and concerns abt corruption, asshat, not bc their crypto-commies

1700 2018-01-05 22:08:15 Best platform I've ever used, only problem is that after 200 trade logs you neee to pay 0.08 BTC for each year or 1 btc for a lifetime subscription, which might be a no go for some people

1702 2018-01-05 22:08:13 No one is certain of anything about #bitcoin and #crypto , not even blockchain. That's the main reason I sold off my 15 bitcoins and concentrated more on trading. I make about 6k+ weekly trading with @beyerfx 's  strategy and I'm cool with that.

1706 2018-01-05 22:07:57 So I experimented with simple token and doubled a simple investment of $50. I have since then exchanged all my simple token for verge. Let’s see if I can keep this wave going. #simpletoken #verge #crypto
1707 2018-01-05 22:07:56 I think banks have to to hold XRP to transact
1708 2018-01-05 22:07:55 If you can make more money in something else and still come back to it, I think it was a wise move. XVG has been hovering around this price point for a few days now.
1709 2018-01-05 22:07:53 I am afraid all the FUD in the past weeks, the UGLY and serious conflict between @officialmcafee & @XVGWhaleReal onboard was way to much for #XVG. Trust is everything, and most of it is lost, for now. IMHO we have to give it couple of weeks or month to cool down..time will tell

1724 2018-01-05 22:07:07 I get it, Charlie! We want to use crypto to purchase things. The name of the game is "large retail adoption." Companies aren't going to trust a coin that is centralized and can't handle transactions. LTC is decentralized. LTC handles transactions.

1735 2018-01-05 22:06:29 Maybe I'm missing something, but ripple seems to be tethering fiats to one another in order to help them compete with crypto right? There using an application to do that. XRP is an after thought which will eventually take the leverage of the platform and become a currency.

1741 2018-01-05 22:06:16 If you’re interested in investing in crypto currency then you need to invest in Tron. My $400 is now 6k. Get in while you can 
1742 2018-01-05 22:06:11 I’ve realised that there are so many anti-Ripple-ites because the crypto community is full of so many literal babies. They have no idea about how complex and aggravating moving a lot of money is, or how it works. They’re more just ‘f*ck the government mehn’ type people.
1743 2018-01-05 22:06:05 Lol. Just ask about their risk appetite. It's okay to not do crypto my guy.
1744 2018-01-05 22:06:00 If a privacy coin is private there is no need to spray FUD. There are clear downsides to real privacy coins, namely big txsize/slow transactions/high fees. But research goes on, zkSNARKS or bulletproofs for example. #xvg #vergecurrency

TL:DR - Don't FOMO into coins just because $BTC is on the run.

1777 2018-01-05 22:03:32 In your honest opinion, can you name a crypto team that would be more likely to deliver the coin than this one? I think people are investing in a team as much as the tech. They seem very competitant, reliable, and extremely ambitious.

1796 2018-01-05 22:02:49 Have you looked into $APPC that was just released on Binance? Looks verrrryyy promising.
1797 2018-01-05 22:02:46 Do you have a target price to sell?
1798 2018-01-05 22:02:44 Best advice I can give you - Don't go chasing profits because you're #alts are down.
The 10x coins are a risky bet now, a lot are overvalued, so look for coins that haven't exploded and add a long term position

1801 2018-01-05 22:02:29 So much anger about stocks and crypto going up in price. Cheer up. It will be ok.
1802 2018-01-05 22:02:29 In fact, no. #UPBIT mostly mirrors #Bittrex markets for BTC and ETH pairs. Check any BTC or ETH pair on Upbit vs Bittrex, you will see the same price action and volume.

people are coming in droves 

- if the most desperate end up making a fortune by betting on the scammiest coins- all good I guess?! 
1821 2018-01-05 22:01:15 Good Answer so are you looking movies without sound? ;)
1822 2018-01-05 22:01:10 Welcome to Crypto. In this world the objective is to accumulate more BTC, not USD. If your BTC balance is going down but you are making money in USD - In this world you are losing. Change the way you view things, benchmark against a BTC return!

1829 2018-01-05 22:00:39 Don’t think crypto ripple would hit anywhere outside of companies who have their valuations dependent on crypto... like $SQ or $RIOT etc. most companies don’t have anything baked into them relating to crypto in my opinion
1830 2018-01-05 22:00:39 Great day for my crypto!
1831 2018-01-05 22:00:32 You ever tried to purchase anything with a few gold chains? wont work unless you are in detroit.

unofficially Virgin was the client , yet to reveal .

1859 2018-01-05 21:58:43 so you manipulated the market to get the price up then acted like a complete idiot on a launch and watched verge sink like a rock lmao. youre only safe on your twitter fan base. on every crypto page on facebook i can find, you are the face of horrible marketing.

1863 2018-01-05 21:58:36 I'd like to thank Ethereum for getting jammed up so trx couldn't continue it's bull run from last night all eth is all in on @Tronfoundation . Finally time to take it easy and watch the spectacular #tron gobble the #crypto world. Remember when i called it a week ago?

1869 2018-01-05 21:58:12 I think the use and the tech of a crypto is way more important then marketing lol...

1876 2018-01-05 21:57:43 Verge is a lot better with @VergeWhale off
1877 2018-01-05 21:57:43 I know, I’m just saying Verge hasn’t changed much since the supposed wraith release on New Years , and now it’s supposed to blow up ?? I doubt it
1878 2018-01-05 21:57:42 Litecoin increased in value less than 4% between January 1st and March 29th 2017.

Litecoin increased by 7700% compared to Bitcoins 1700% in 2017.

Buy the dips, #HODL and be patient. You are not in this for 4%.

1880 2018-01-05 21:57:31 Yes. Screw u @officialmcafee  u piece of failure
1881 2018-01-05 21:57:16 Target?
1882 2018-01-05 21:57:14 What’s a USD? Good coin? Target? When moon?
1883 2018-01-05 21:57:14 I don't think @officialmcafee had any major negative impact. And it did skyrocket after he talked about it.

@XVGWhale  on the other hand just needs to learn to be quiet. Over-hyping is a turnoff for investors, and it was blatantly obvious.

1888 2018-01-05 21:57:07 When getting into a long debate with someone on crypto twitter, you can assume that they're not a Nazi, but at some point it might be necessary to ask them directly. Just to be sure. smdh
1889 2018-01-05 21:57:04 How to Crypto for Curious NoCoiners: 

1. Concentrate the bulk of your money into #Bitcoin- it’s the brand name, it has the longest track record of success, and it’s your best bet for long term gainz. Decentralized with a hard limit of 21m coins- Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.
1890 2018-01-05 21:57:03 Everyday.
1891 2018-01-05 21:57:00 Sell it when u make a profit that u r happy with it
1892 2018-01-05 21:56:58 A new ATH for $BTC will be great for Alt-coins -> will bring in lots of new money to crypto -> new investors are psychologically inclined to buy low priced alts $TRX $ADA $XRP $XLM $FUN
1893 2018-01-05 21:56:51 #HODL ON!!
1894 2018-01-05 21:56:48 It's open sourced, the reason they didn't have a marketing team is one of the most value creating.
1895 2018-01-05 21:56:45 Shitcoin , shit leader who lied to his investors , shit community who just wants it money back . Look at tron a real coin , a real investment not a car garage project
1896 2018-01-05 21:56:43 It shows all your buys and sells it’s pretty straight forward I mean like if you got an audit
1897 2018-01-05 21:56:41 Crypto Brian here. Low key at the moment. Good luck to you both in 2018! Look forward to the new platform and hopefully soon I’ll finish that dang course! Lol

1906 2018-01-05 21:56:14 In short Mark is saying he wants to manipulate crypto, which is something I never want to see. Mark should stay out of it because only bad things will happen when a guy with his type of money gets into an unregulated economy such as crypto - he will regulate it with his own $$$
1907 2018-01-05 21:56:12 cheers mate
1908 2018-01-05 21:56:12 I just figured they would ask for your binance or bitrex records just like they ask for your bank statement ?

1918 2018-01-05 21:55:43 Market cap doesnt really portray the value of the Tron Foundation. Dont compare apples with oranges. The whole crypto market is based on experiments with very little if any use cases. Agree that crazy money is just flowing in now to fund this FOMO. Choose wisely people

1931 2018-01-05 21:55:01 Whilst bitcoin has its dick out nothing is exploding
1932 2018-01-05 21:54:58 I believe that has been done already in the past. Now a lot of big companies are accepting it as they saw many being failed to move attention away from crypto
1933 2018-01-05 21:54:57 I'm no longer a guest host on Crypto News.  No worries as I will be launching my own channel shortly.  Everyone know how I do things so it's all good!  I will be moving stronger in 2018!!!  Software is launching in 10 daysAny PCG client has a question hit me up !!

1940 2018-01-05 21:54:39 Is this a HODL or momentum play?

1944 2018-01-05 21:54:30 Estimating the value of crypto. Smart man!
1945 2018-01-05 21:54:30 pretty much just cover up ripple and you are redeemed.
1946 2018-01-05 21:54:26 How does one DM you if you are not following them? I'm a front-end dev deep into the crypto-hole and interested.
1947 2018-01-05 21:54:26 very much expected, crypto's cyber-criminals currency of choice.  Stringent AML and Information Security controls a must, companies must up their game cos criminals will.

1955 2018-01-05 21:54:06 Hi @BTCMarkets. Is there a current ongoing issue with crypto deposits? Looking to make a few deposits but wanted to check before I do. Thanks.
1956 2018-01-05 21:54:02 #RDD #reddcoin is another #cryptocurrency that will soon be taking off. It's currently incredibly undervalued and I vote it one of the best buys of Q1 #2018.

So many undervalued #crypto gems out there. It's all a matter of finding them.

1985 2018-01-05 21:52:00 with all the buzz about #Crypto these days, I wish they really were referencing Cryptozoology. It would make all Crypto convos more interesting bc everyone would be discussing Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster, and Chupacabras instead of how internet money works. #cryptocurrency
1986 2018-01-05 21:51:59 Btc bullrun would be interesting to watch for the next few days.
Not that btc will bring some gains, but alts will be at bargain. $btc $alts $crypto
1987 2018-01-05 21:51:58 That's a good question I mined it four years ago when it was worth next to nothing. And at the time I thought it might eventually make it to a penny a coin. Now we're there. I see lots of big money coming into crypto in last month, very hard to estimate.
1988 2018-01-05 21:51:55 Not one person that I know that’s in bitconnect, has not been paid, on time, daily.
1989 2018-01-05 21:51:48 What if you need both to trust that the scarce asset is transactable and that the transactable currency is valuable as an asset to hold and continue transacting with? 

A peer to peer, highly secured, on chain cash system, if you will. $BCH

Buy cryptokitties otherwise.

1993 2018-01-05 21:51:32 Ok, I'm catching your drift and will read more when able to, but wouldn't that mean that no privacy coin is better than another? It would then be the end user's preference on which to use, yeah? So why not spread fud on all of them?

2028 2018-01-05 21:49:42 That doesn't make sense,the crypto world is what we are putting our money into.If your able to swap any coin,each one has a benefit that gives us huge rewards for buying their coin.If we could hold on to the ones making us money , at the same time swap to a ripple/coin card.

2047 2018-01-05 21:48:29 $2.00 ; 2018 will be a crazy yr. The word is getting out about Crypto. 
2048 2018-01-05 21:48:28 Chill buddy. It is actually very hard to find people with serious money in crypto. Even harder to find those that do that are taking serious profits. This party has just started.
2049 2018-01-05 21:48:25 When I got into crypto my justifiable risk/reward ratio was 20:1 (sensible) and 200:1 (silly outside chance). Today it is 2 or 3:1 (sensible max) and 5-10:1 (silly outside chance). You do the math(s) #bitcoin
2050 2018-01-05 21:48:23 Important lesson learned in #crypto, take some profits when your alt coin goes 2x and again if it goes 4x or more.
2051 2018-01-05 21:48:23 AND YOURE NOT IN CRYPTO
2052 2018-01-05 21:48:20 Woooooow

2063 2018-01-05 21:47:36 Exactly. If banks do use XRP then they will transfer into XRP at exact moment they need to and immediately from XRP into final currency. Velocity will be massive and XRP network value does not need to be very large to facilitate these transfers. Happy to hear if I’m wrong?
2064 2018-01-05 21:47:34 You are so bent on verge failing #FUD
2065 2018-01-05 21:47:28 What about crypto?
2066 2018-01-05 21:47:21 That's exactly what it is.  What I use it for,  the first step in investing in a new crypto.
2067 2018-01-05 21:47:20 Been waiting ages, hope you are right.
2068 2018-01-05 21:47:18 Agreed, it has gotten the beat down so some whales could load for the long term. Any minnows buying now and drafting behind will see exponential gains. I am a minnow at the moment, but eating as fast as I can :-)
2069 2018-01-05 21:47:09 Oh. Is this another forgotten coin that's mooning. This is absolutely crazy what a time to be alive.
2070 2018-01-05 21:47:07 Y’all buying crypto I’m investing in myself
2071 2018-01-05 21:47:02 With that being said. Are alts in danger if btc continues to climb and the crypto market cap doesn’t grow at the same rate? Currently a lot of exchanges are not able to sign up new members. Which I see can be an issue for alts in the following week.
2072 2018-01-05 21:47:00 These pullbacks are all part of a healthy market. Normal profit taking results in buying opportunities and better entry points. People seem to think there’s something wrong when a crypto is down 25%. What they fail to realize is this should be expected after such big runs.
2073 2018-01-05 21:46:53 Always questioned the IRS and this bullshit about taxes on crypto makes no sense... looking forward to what you can figure out!
2074 2018-01-05 21:46:49 Three Dollar!
2075 2018-01-05 21:46:47 I fully agree. I wouldn't move my money around in btc unless time is not a constraint.

2080 2018-01-05 21:46:33 1/ Five big misunderstandings in crypto. “The important innovation is not Bitcoin, but the blockchain technology behind it”. There is no open, public, permissionless blockchain without a native token. Will 2018 bring us back from DLT to crypto?

2102 2018-01-05 21:45:09 Not #bitcoin though, it fucking sucks.
2103 2018-01-05 21:45:00 $SALT seems like a pretty solid platform.  Accepting crypto assets as collateral for a loan is genius.
2104 2018-01-05 21:44:57 I was assuming 2am too unfortunately. Doubt il survive that long tonight!
2105 2018-01-05 21:44:54 #bitconnect is no scam just people who hate it. Have you heard of anyone saying they didnt get paid out? All is good. Try it out and if you dont like it fuck it, crypto can be a gamble sometimes.

2108 2018-01-05 21:44:40 Gotcha, in that case then I've been following @kunal00. He's been trading a lot of crypto. No BS check him out, cool dude and legit from what I've noticed. I'm not really a crypto guy but i'd trade it as i have before... (I'm still in the learning stages and I LOVE Trading)
2109 2018-01-05 21:44:38 4 hrs and 15 min away, wala magic lol.

2115 2018-01-05 21:44:23 just bought minits before your post 30k verge
2116 2018-01-05 21:44:19 
2117 2018-01-05 21:44:18 The whole point of crypto is to pay directly, I think the services that let u exchange back to fiat via a debit card is more like providing a bank service rather than changing the payment landscape. Maybe this boot-up-the-ass is kind of good. More direct crypto acceptance needed.
2118 2018-01-05 21:44:08 If the central banks ever have enough courage to raise rates, crypto currencies would only remain for criminals. Can't see an institution giving me 4% for my bitcoins
2119 2018-01-05 21:43:52 2AM GMT/UTC I think?

2122 2018-01-05 21:43:50 @ShipChain overwhelming success and potential has caused them to sell out their ICO. This is due to the exponential increase in investors that were interested in the pre-sale. Disrupting the shipping industry with blockchain will certainly progress the crypto world. #shipchain
2123 2018-01-05 21:43:49 I need this in my life!
2124 2018-01-05 21:43:47 Why the fuck would you want to make 1% of your money in Crypto?
2125 2018-01-05 21:43:45 I'm actually shorting BTC at 17,240     x25 leverage :) stop loss very important!
2126 2018-01-05 21:43:41 One new coin we recommended while back is called BMC (Blackmoon Crypto) get in now before the hype and marketing starts. It’s up 30% today to $1.38 per coin. Our target is $100 per coin. #BTC #DASH #XRP #ETN #TRX
2127 2018-01-05 21:43:36 Had a friend tell me to invest my $5k into bitcoin three years ago. I’ve only been investing in crypto for 3 months...
2128 2018-01-05 21:43:34 Or do you support bitcoin, a so called decentralized crypto when currency is quite literally controlled by three Chinese mining pools!!!  Get the facts before protesting!!!
2129 2018-01-05 21:43:32 We’re ready for takeoff
2130 2018-01-05 21:43:31 it's great for crypto world. it is not for real world. swapping coins instantly is amazing for crypto people. but if I can't get starbucks to start accepting any one of those coins that I can atomically swap, it's of no use to me.
2131 2018-01-05 21:43:24 I haven't received a reply yet. It's been a week
2132 2018-01-05 21:43:24 use @Mastercard for fiat not @Visa
2133 2018-01-05 21:43:21 It's not investing, it's speculation, and even so, good reasons are needed to allocate funds in a cryptofolio, and I'm not convinced so far. I don't understand what you mean with "selling to double up", please explain.
2134 2018-01-05 21:43:14 Crypto is the greatest accumulation of wealth since the 90’s tech boom.  It’ll also lead to the largest loss of financial gain ever.  Enjoy the ride.
2135 2018-01-05 21:43:13 For reliability and fee there's better coins than $bcash
2136 2018-01-05 21:43:10 Crypto buyers, what's the best methodology for a broke boi like me to get into crypto trading? And is It all speculative like stocks? I don't have the slightest idea how any of It works but I want in #cryptocurrency #crypto
2137 2018-01-05 21:43:09 
2138 2018-01-05 21:43:05 The best tip someone gave me is to delete Blockfolio. It works wonders, haha
2139 2018-01-05 21:43:02 $TRX.X folks do realize we were cheering at .10 just a few days ago.  Lol @ the crypto world.  Great problems to have
2140 2018-01-05 21:43:01 THIS IS AWESOME!
2141 2018-01-05 21:42:58 Really the bankers coin.
2142 2018-01-05 21:42:57 As soon as Amazon accepts crypto, you can flush bezop down the toilet.
2143 2018-01-05 21:42:57 that is very unprofessional from VISA
2144 2018-01-05 21:42:56 I'm telling you guys, Japan is one of the biggest player in crypto currency, and the hottest coin now is PACCOIN and $GCN. watch it moooon.
2145 2018-01-05 21:42:54 So if you sell your crypto currency do you get act dollar value for it?
2146 2018-01-05 21:42:53 Crypto all the way!
2147 2018-01-05 21:42:45 2018 is supposed to be the year of the #altcoins . The turnside is that it's fucking difficult to stay away from all the #FOMO. #AltsAreBack #shitcoins too .

2150 2018-01-05 21:42:42 I agree, I saw this coming days ago thanks to what I've learned from your videos! Thank you Haejin!!!
2151 2018-01-05 21:42:42 I really hope the crypto movement will get the open hardware movement rolling. it is so unacceptable that we trust opensource software but rely on closed source hardware.
2152 2018-01-05 21:42:41 @HEROcoinio Please stop the price manipulation at Coinbene. Thanks.
2153 2018-01-05 21:42:41 Mebbe an @ symbol on the tip of your elbow , so that’s the last thing your enemy sees right before you pop him in the eye.
2154 2018-01-05 21:42:40 Hope you are right.
2155 2018-01-05 21:42:39 BUY some crypto better

2160 2018-01-05 21:42:12 I feel like, at this time in crypto, people are going to sell off the alts that made them money but will always return back to the alts that treated them well. Strong hands, hold your alts, and don't be afraid to take profits if your confident.
2161 2018-01-05 21:42:10 I've never printed out so many things in my life before crypto
2162 2018-01-05 21:42:01 Looking forward to it !

2168 2018-01-05 21:41:45 Asıl senin şaşırman ilginç. 
Bunlar hep üfürükten teyyare coinler. Onlar shitcoin abileri btc den tirtikladi. Şimdi de btc onlardan. Hiçbi kullanımı olmayan coinler bi pump bi dump gider böyle. Ether nasıl yavaş ve istikrarlı mesela. Çünkü kullanılıyor.

2173 2018-01-05 21:41:35 When I first look at @BitcoinTre I automatically stereotype that he’s a basketball player. But he’s a crypto currency junkie hahaha. RESPECT
2174 2018-01-05 21:41:34 "Raising"? I thought he was a Genius, Bitcoin Multi-Millionaire???
2175 2018-01-05 21:41:33 Crypto will implode when regulators move in. People will lose virtually everything in a matter of minutes.
2176 2018-01-05 21:41:30 I think I love you!
2177 2018-01-05 21:41:25 Thank you! And equally I learn so much from you on a daily basis. Very grateful for all your consistent knowledge buddy!

2185 2018-01-05 21:41:10 yeah it's fun making stupid amounts of money from crypto but you know what's more fun? 

making other people stupid amounts of money from crypto. 
2186 2018-01-05 21:41:08 Thats what u said in the verge community  ;) shilln
2187 2018-01-05 21:41:07 Nooo. You are going to drive these people crazy.

2189 2018-01-05 21:41:03 
2190 2018-01-05 21:41:02 Wouldn't expect central banks to hold or transact in non-fist crypto but they may issue fiat-backed digital tokens on decentralized exchanges.
2191 2018-01-05 21:41:00 Luckily crypto has no borders.
2192 2018-01-05 21:40:56 HOPE SO!!
2193 2018-01-05 21:40:53 Let it Rain !!
2194 2018-01-05 21:40:47 In an alt bear market, whenever $BTC moves alts dump and recover less each time.

In an alt bull market, whenever BTC moves alts dump and recover more the next time.

There will still be dips, don't get shaken out.

$crypto

p.s. in a BTC bear market don't buy alts.

2223 2018-01-05 21:39:32 when it comes to digital assets the scarcity makes them far better as a store of value. If I had the option of paying for something using either my bank card or crypto - I will always use the bank card. No point in spending something today that will be worth more tomorrow.
2224 2018-01-05 21:39:25 Outch ! I Would relate to that !
2225 2018-01-05 21:39:20 You don't even follow me though 
2226 2018-01-05 21:39:18 How are you in crypto and not taking drugs
2227 2018-01-05 21:39:14 Also, for the last time I'll tell you this, get your ass in, invest in XRP while it's still available and cheap. I swear, you'll regret it if you don't and lament this day. Get in for your own fucking good.

2235 2018-01-05 21:38:37 i am part of that 18%
2236 2018-01-05 21:38:31 It's ironic if one needs a Visa (physical) card to spend cryptocurrencies.  It's a little ridiculous that's the modus operandi for someone new coming into crypto.
2237 2018-01-05 21:38:31 You can thank Trump for crypto skyrocketing. People are afraid of the government and the world's path now more than ever.
2238 2018-01-05 21:38:28 Casinocoin, mark my words
2239 2018-01-05 21:38:26 Crypto feels like a Ponzi scheme right now definitely think its The future but the instability of it right now is scary
2240 2018-01-05 21:38:25 Yeah what you do is very inspiring 
2241 2018-01-05 21:38:19 1 week in crypto feels like years irl

2243 2018-01-05 21:38:14 I'm trying to find something to support my understanding. Instead of thinking jimmy coffee shop is running a node and joey coffee drinker is running a node so they have to confirm their coffee crypto exchange on chain, instead think both use bread wallet.
2244 2018-01-05 21:38:10 Hey man... Think about WWIII coming... I suggest Australia or El Salvador or Canada
2245 2018-01-05 21:38:02 Yes, those all sound great and there is decent daily volume, but DPOS is weaker security than POW, easier to hack (see vertcoin), and BCH has fast and cheap tx with ability to scale in the most secure manner (on chain), with best security (POW SHA256 with massive hshpwr).
2246 2018-01-05 21:38:00 why are you promoting fake news ?

2268 2018-01-05 21:36:30 Petite question, à partir de combien de capitalisation pouvons-nous considérer que le marché des crypto cours un risque de retournement important ? Qu elle est la place des monnaies alternatives dans cette configuration ? Exemple Cardano qui capitalise 18 milliard à ce jour.

2273 2018-01-05 21:36:12 Anyone know #Ether #gas mechanics in #cryptocurrency transactions? Specifically, how they are set by exchanges. Recent transaction delays baffle me. We pay % fees, which obviously increase as #ETH goes up. Are they throttling the gas down and maximising margins? I smell a rat!

2277 2018-01-05 21:36:03 I gotta focus more on the technical side of crypto rather than being so fixed on its price
2278 2018-01-05 21:35:57 What are they trying to achieve, I don't get it? Anyway, promoting many ICOs seems not like something Crypto Investor would do... at all :)

2280 2018-01-05 21:35:50 Their website doesnt say anything. The communication and their community it’s pretty weak( its a shame actually, they need to be more opened), all rhe ico growth its based on news, community and vloggers help. Hope we will get some news from them asap... #vice #ico #crypto

2309 2018-01-05 21:34:00 where are you currently?
2310 2018-01-05 21:33:55 Much appreciated! 
2311 2018-01-05 21:33:55 Naturally because $THO and $WGO charts are closest thing to crypto
2312 2018-01-05 21:33:46 This will be fun. Using crypto hopper making multiple transactions every few minutes 24/7/365 - that won't take long to analyse.
2313 2018-01-05 21:33:45 Can you fix the wallet beforehand? If that didn’t happen, it would leave a sour taste in customers mouth moving forward with your exchange.
2314 2018-01-05 21:33:39 I still have to pay transaction fee to miners when I send my coins to someone, why I want to use crypto currency ? Also I don’t get interest on my coin wallet ?
2315 2018-01-05 21:33:38 Yeah I am saying in addition to, $ICX is quality project!
2316 2018-01-05 21:33:31 Seems like there is some tension between this tweet (which strikes me as accurate) and the ones preceding it. If national dems are crypto-centrists, why is the GOP justified in feeling/claiming the dems aren't magnanimous?
2317 2018-01-05 21:33:29 If the students get matrix multiplication, then that's a way into inverses via crypto. Otherwise, you can use affine ciphers, e.g. f(x)=(5x+7) MOD 26. But that requires modular arithmetic.

2340 2018-01-05 21:32:06 Think about that for a second - only 4% of the worlds population is invested in crypto... The growth and opportunity there is phenomenal... We will all be millionaires in 10 years when crypto is more the norm and people are more comfortable investing.

2365 2018-01-05 21:30:29 At this point just mentioning cryptocurrency is good for business. Half of these businesses won't implement anything crypto related but hey, if it's good for business it's good for business.

2369 2018-01-05 21:30:12 In the case of fewer large holdings eg: developers hold a high % - Developers often want their crypto listed on as many exchanges as possible and could likely supply exchanges with large amounts on request.

2391 2018-01-05 21:28:49 Eg: Coin gets listed on a new exchange, exchange needs to buy up a lot of the crypto. In this scenario the supply is so distributed that the only way to obtain it in bulk is to keep buying it which in-turn raises the price to a point where investors liquidate it.

2401 2018-01-05 21:28:03 well at this point apparently  only 4% of the world's population is invested into Crypto. so maybe it could bring total economic collapse later on. That's why I'm diversified into #silver. So I'll be wealthy during the collapse also. (;

2411 2018-01-05 21:27:27 #vergecurrency s problem is, they can not add these additional layers of privacy without sacrificing speed and low fees. At the moment you can be private, or fast. Fast and "a bit private" does not work. #xvg
2412 2018-01-05 21:27:27 I don’t know how long this has been going on, but the ideological fault line in crypto seems to be anarcho-capitalism vs crypto-nationalism, where the latter is localist and fascist-friendly, and the former is not. 20 years from now things will still be off the chain.

I did buy back some $TRX at .11 though so im ok : )

2423 2018-01-05 21:26:30 I was offered $800 worth of bitcoin years back when I sold some hosting customers from one of my servers - It was about 8cents a coin then. I told him I wanted Paypal since I never had time to get involved in the bitcoin.
2424 2018-01-05 21:26:30 @iurimatias @5chdn Should we do a reddit AMA with our the sister EthTrader r/ethrater ? #ethereum Anyone want that? The telegram channel has been around a long time now for Crypto.

2427 2018-01-05 21:25:56 Absolutely, and that's the point of #XVG - total anonymity - not only that but lightning speed transactions... The real question I have is what will Crypto do to the USD in the long run?
2428 2018-01-05 21:25:56 Bought the dip. Feels good. #Crypto
2429 2018-01-05 21:25:54 volume is good. See what happened to $ trn. This coin is in the top 100 of coin market cap. This coin can really quickly increase in value.
2430 2018-01-05 21:25:46 Hell yeah crypto gang
2431 2018-01-05 21:25:46 Definitely not. I say stealth addresses and TOR are not enough to reach the goal of highest possible privacy. There are reasons why other pivacy coins have additional features to hide for example transaction amounts. #xvg #vergecurrency
2432 2018-01-05 21:25:41 Not sure all the crypto influencers are promoting $DADI for the project or for the referral program...
2433 2018-01-05 21:25:41 Lol WTF is going on with $SC
2434 2018-01-05 21:25:39 TRON is about to MARS

2439 2018-01-05 21:25:19 Over 15 billion Verge. Bitcoin has 21 million. Due to the network effect, Bitcoin has already assumed the position of digital gold. There isn’t a next Bitcoin unless and until Bitcoin is no longer in the position of digital gold. Bitcoin is the king of crypto.

2442 2018-01-05 21:25:16 Awesome. Thx!
2443 2018-01-05 21:25:10 Xrp? Same amount coins... And If I learned one thing in Crypto world never Say never  If everthing was logic we all had loads of money...
2444 2018-01-05 21:25:09 @Gerbz Great content on the @TropicalMBA podcast. Thank you for taking the time to chat Crypto
2445 2018-01-05 21:25:07 ... staysavy
2446 2018-01-05 21:25:04 Curious poll time. Do you have $$ in crypto?
2447 2018-01-05 21:25:02 When donyou think 11k?
2448 2018-01-05 21:24:59 My ticket id is 132976. Please look at it. I have sent all necessary infornations and screenshot with this ticket email. Not only i haven’t received ethereum but also i lost money for not making trade!!!!
2449 2018-01-05 21:24:57 sure will do
2450 2018-01-05 21:24:45 I also do not care about GPU specs as I don’t mine crypto or play games…. 
2451 2018-01-05 21:24:44 Official crypto news network
2452 2018-01-05 21:24:42 MLM have been around forever and I think the concepts just clicks with weak minds. I know a « top crypto blogging experts with 1 whole  year of experience » who is going to have rude awakening one day
2453 2018-01-05 21:24:33 Definitely better to learn by doing. Trying to create my own crypto, even with no intention of deployment, taught me how to really evaluate projects.
2454 2018-01-05 21:24:32 @Cryptopia_NZ when are you going to add market price to your trades? Your platform drives me insane! Not user friendly at all!
2455 2018-01-05 21:24:22 Any good telegram groups for crypto? Share links please

2459 2018-01-05 21:24:16 Well done buddy.

I've been on panda a long time. Also bought into meow, still have it waiting for my lynx, and had Pac  (admittedly sold 75% of it but still got 20 mil).

Indeed, things change in a heartbeat in the world of crypto.
2460 2018-01-05 21:24:10 Pls count me in this time!!
2461 2018-01-05 21:24:07 (;´Д｀)ﾊｧﾊｧ
2462 2018-01-05 21:24:03 Every $ matters! @EOS let’s go! If #EOS hits $150 dollars in 2018 I’m gonna give away 10 subscribers 1,000 dollars each! Mark this post #crypto #altcoins
2463 2018-01-05 21:23:49 Yeah, I know, phishy. The usual when someone realizes it can be true what I am saying. Google it, stealth addresses are known to not grant privacy since 2014. I did not create the analysis 4 years ago to FUD #xvg today ;)
2464 2018-01-05 21:23:47 If no import, than a user must manually enter each trade individually? Or, do you use API keys to get trades from exchanges? Another thought, what about importing wallet addresses for transactions?
2465 2018-01-05 21:23:46 indeed 
2466 2018-01-05 21:23:43 It's worth more than that, but it doesn't mean everything in the crypto space is worth something.
2467 2018-01-05 21:23:41 Great call from @signals_premium !!  Another winner. I was able to buy the dip at 183 SATs. #BTC #crypto #ETN #Viacoin #xvg

2472 2018-01-05 21:23:17 Shoutout to @littleroach_ for getting me to 15k followers. This kid is a fuckin crypto mastermind.
2473 2018-01-05 21:23:15 Has anybody sent any crypto like ETH out of Coinbase to any exchange in the last few hours? Did you get it? Did take long? I want to take advantage of these dips and peaks but I can’t deal with a 10+ hour pending transaction.
2474 2018-01-05 21:23:12 I wish you the best of luck! 2018 will be a great year for crypto. I hope you’re debt free by the end of the year.
2475 2018-01-05 21:23:03 Both are good projects but ICX has lots of news this month, so for now this will be my choice.

2489 2018-01-05 21:22:25 Exactly. Ripple is going to be used as a debt tool by banks just like the US dollar and other fiat. True crypto is a commodity.

2505 2018-01-05 21:21:10 Hey Ghost, sorry I dont know how I missed this comment. We definitely have plans to be listed on more exchanges. Once we move forward with our blockchain and finalize everything we will begin applying to more exchanges.
2506 2018-01-05 21:21:09 Buy? Hahaha is this a joke? Sell that shit.
2507 2018-01-05 21:21:03 Soon enough, patience will be rewarded!
2508 2018-01-05 21:20:45 No one in the telegram seems to know what coin is for.
2509 2018-01-05 21:20:39 Monaco is perfectly fine
2510 2018-01-05 21:20:38 The real question - long-term - and I'm talking 5 years down the road, can #btc compete with alt-coins?..... I view #btc becoming a real "tax problem" for a lot of people in the coming years as crypto trading grows, which is where a coin like #XVG comes in - fast and anonymous.
2511 2018-01-05 21:20:36 Thank you god that BTC broke the 16.5k level - it's prob about time for a BTC rally (and that's a good thing).

If you own BTC (I do) sell some in the highs and buy the smashed alts to come. Hodl on boys and girls.
2512 2018-01-05 21:20:27 Still no answer about adding WAX to @CoinomiWallet despite many many attempts and questions to support. Great project, shit customer service.

2516 2018-01-05 21:20:14 Larry, do you trade crypto w same size/strategy as your equity positions?
2517 2018-01-05 21:20:11 I love being a market maker

2519 2018-01-05 21:20:08 I’ve been waiting for Ethereum transfer from Ledger Nano S to HitBTC ethereum deposit address for 5 days! Still awaiting. I have checked eth address twice before sent it.

2524 2018-01-05 21:19:51 USD is the biggest currency and most value in the world. But it has no fundamental backing except a fiat debt based trust system
2525 2018-01-05 21:19:47 Monaco is not affected by this
2526 2018-01-05 21:19:43 in essence how are they gonna track what cryptos we exchange for other cryptos. Especially when we are using encrypted and anonymous non- traceable currency coins like #XVG ? Could privacy coins become a safe haven from the #IRS

2541 2018-01-05 21:18:33 it is a well thought out article, i give @twobitidiot credit. i think @Ripple is well on it's way to overcoming these obstacles. they are doing everything right, the only thing left is time - won't happen overnight
2542 2018-01-05 21:18:26 I just happened to throw 20 bucks at it yesterday. Up to $115 right now. Upsetting that I didn't throw a few hundred but there's no way I could've for seen that. I plan on selling before the swap too.
2543 2018-01-05 21:18:22 Another good day on crypto so far, been busier today so haven’t traded much but up another 30% on the portfolio, thanks to $ost mostly. Looking forward to Monday after a bullish sounding tweet from @TexasEddieG , mans getting stuff done! #myn

2557 2018-01-05 21:17:07 1 - network effects = result of growth & is a goal of every coin - not a value prop

2 - $xrp becomes less volatile the larger it grows, more liquid it becomes - which also reduces substantial risk 

3 - institutions (only exist to make money) will use $xrp to save/make money

2572 2018-01-05 21:16:00 I was thinking about this today. Wall Street has not even touched crypto yet. People still don’t have a super easy way to buy in and people like my dad still think it’s a scam. Wait til this time bomb goes off. Any coin left standing is going cosmic.

2574 2018-01-05 21:15:54 Marketplaces for many of these coins don’t even exist  suffering from FOMO #crypto #ICO #dapps #dapp #networks
2575 2018-01-05 21:15:49 At $27, DGB would equal current BTC market cap. If you think that's crazy, realize that BTC equaled DGB's current market cap 4.5 years ago. Considering the flood of new people that will be coming into crypto over next year, DGB will likely take less than 4.5 years to get there.

2577 2018-01-05 21:15:46 With Xmoneta, you can create deposits on the blockchain, transfer cryptocurrencies and money to each other on the VISA/MasterCard and/or the crypto-wallets. #Xmoneta #XmonetaICO #XMN #XmonetaCrowdfunding #Xmoneta_platform #TokenSale #blockchain
2578 2018-01-05 21:15:42 @kucoincom started around the same time and has killed in volume. This POS exchange has the same volume as they did 3 months ago(initial Coss run) with the same issues. I used to be one of @cosscrypto biggest supporters. No longer. They cost me thousands these last 2 days.

Lots of buy pressure, we might see a little breakout in amongst the #alts bleeding.

2581 2018-01-05 21:15:32 It's a bad idea, don't invest in crypto, pretty much every financial expert warns against it.

2583 2018-01-05 21:15:23 Very nice
2584 2018-01-05 21:15:21 İyi okumalar dilerim:)
2585 2018-01-05 21:15:20 Cheers to all the fellow crypto attorneys in the trenches!
2586 2018-01-05 21:15:16 Yep

2590 2018-01-05 21:14:59 I started a support ticket and you guys said it was a glitch. A very expensive glitch to say the least 
2591 2018-01-05 21:14:55 “@GDAX, @neflix of #crypto world”
@carterthomas

2592 2018-01-05 21:14:50 Compliant exchanges will provide you with your txn history.  Give it to your accountant/tax preparer/lawyer and let them have at it.  No one should be preparing their own taxes anyway...
2593 2018-01-05 21:14:46 @coinbase is manipulating the crypto market. They r the easiest platform 4 trading but ALWAYS shutdown when trading should be high & withholding info until the most-interesting times. This @Ripple announcement takes the cake. I'm sure some1 hit a lick @ the expense of others.

2598 2018-01-05 21:14:25 ATH. Probably in the next few days-one week
2599 2018-01-05 21:14:18 Is that a double bottom I see on $TRX?
2600 2018-01-05 21:14:17 L'animal, tu va farm les crypto toi nan ?
2601 2018-01-05 21:14:14 indirdim bile ;)
2602 2018-01-05 21:14:12 No the new law states u have to report exchanges .. and u can’t do a 1031.. so if u sell Cardano for Tron you have to report and then it’s subject to 39 percent tax...that’s why it just seems more profitable to hold , after 12 months the tax rate is around 15 percent
2603 2018-01-05 21:14:06 I still hold almost 30k XVG,. I'm hoping for the same thing, but PR needs a major shake up.. They're unprofessional and don't seem to understand how to conduct themselves on social media. 

They need some lessons from @justinsuntron #TRX @Tronfoundation
2604 2018-01-05 21:14:02 That’s what I like to hear! There’s a large group of HODLERS
2605 2018-01-05 21:13:53 Can you please give us an update on iota? Thanks!
2606 2018-01-05 21:13:50 Get back to us on how that goes
2607 2018-01-05 21:13:49 Also apparently “binance” is trending which I guess is a bitcoin / crypto finance category and not, as I though, finance apps geared towards bisexuals (which makes zero sense anyway but ???)
2608 2018-01-05 21:13:35 @CNBCClosingBell There ya go @MCaruso_Cabrera theres yer answer! Tho Institutional investors dont have High #exposure to #cryptocurrency If younger #investors dont trust #WallSt & put it all in #Crypto & it doesnt succeed! Uve bankrupted a whole generation of future investors!
2609 2018-01-05 21:13:27 Are you saying that crypto currencies are here to stay because they are a tool for people to get rich off of? (just trying to understand the underlying context).
2610 2018-01-05 21:13:23 #Bitcoin rising again. 
#Ethereum not doing badly but neither here nor there. 
#Ripple, surprisingly, the crypto with second highest market capitalization after #BTC. 
#Tron the new bride. 
The most promising "penny cryptos", IMO, are Tron - $0.23 & Ripple - $3.11. Buy them.
2611 2018-01-05 21:13:20 Bittrex for me. I know I was looking for other people to see if it was just me and I'm guessing people just don't use them or they don't say anything but I did start a support ticket and they said it was a glitch...
2612 2018-01-05 21:13:16 What is the actual thesis here? If this is a crypto pump-and-dump, let's just call it that...?
2613 2018-01-05 21:13:12 We are about to submerge ourselves deep into some revolutionary technology - visit our website to take a spin prior to updates #blockchain #crypto #internet #web #disrupt #notospy
2614 2018-01-05 21:13:12 TA is not indifferent from Crypto and its projects. TA is the perception of value presented in a graph of a project. It says a lot about the fundamentals of a coin. You should learn both, otherwise you dont understand the crypto ecosystem. TA + FA + active particpation.
2615 2018-01-05 21:13:09 By all means, we Boyz want the ladies enjoying this revolution with us! Come in the water is warm!  If you want someone of your chromosomal compliment to trust and follow, I highly recommend the brilliant @starkness !

2619 2018-01-05 21:12:53 Experience points #xp is on the radar. #xp deals with video games, education and sports. Jumped to 37 in the coin market capital with MC 1.1B. The price is pretty small and 100 bucks could get you 20,000 xp coins. 

#bitcoin #xrp #eth #crypto
2620 2018-01-05 21:12:43 I think after back testing and researching my main trade strategy will consist on using a macd, stoch rsi, rsi, volume indicator and a heavy hands on support/resistance trade strategy! And I may add a ema 50,200 depending on the coin $crypto #TA
2621 2018-01-05 21:12:40 It’s another crypto. On fire recently, not so much today.
2622 2018-01-05 21:12:40 I'm officially sorta on the crypto train with my purchase of $WU 
2623 2018-01-05 21:12:38 What do u mean they can’t enforce it

2634 2018-01-05 21:11:38 Maybe 9-10dollars
2635 2018-01-05 21:11:36 Thanks Crypto News for the follow!
2636 2018-01-05 21:11:35 No wonder you had a mental breakdown 
2637 2018-01-05 21:11:33 @BrockMorton  what is Konnor's twitter addy?  fyi, Patrick Dai is lead developer for #QTUM
2638 2018-01-05 21:11:32 Hey @JoelKatz im getting FUDed alot right now. Many of my Crypto friends dont trust @ripple and keep telling me XRP wont be used by banks and companies. When can i finally prove them wrong?
2639 2018-01-05 21:11:31 #Dogecoin is the best example to show that crypto projects can be irrational as well...
2640 2018-01-05 21:11:31 One things for sure: if you are learning T/A then Crypto Is definitely a good playground!
2641 2018-01-05 21:11:30 Curious if you held onto this. $ARN is having a great run today.
2642 2018-01-05 21:11:29 I had a tweet about a sexist dude go viral over the weekend, and a bunch of awesome randos totally destroyed the other sexist dudes who piled into my mentions 
2643 2018-01-05 21:11:27 Got my first x10 of 2018 from an ICO from December maybe shouldn't have taken this long considering the bull alt market but oh well  #crypto #alts
2644 2018-01-05 21:11:24 What is the ETA on this?
2645 2018-01-05 21:11:23 Me too:/
2646 2018-01-05 21:11:23 Update on Ltc?
2647 2018-01-05 21:11:20 Pro tip for all of you that had trouble with cryptos yesterday; Bitcoin goes up, Alt coins go down and vise versa. And keep watching the satoshi value, dollar value will lose you money. 
2648 2018-01-05 21:11:19 I put all my money into crypto, what next?
2649 2018-01-05 21:11:18 @justinsuntron what is the crypto version of throwing my bra at you ?

2651 2018-01-05 21:11:16 What makes crypto trading real hardcore, is that both trading pairs are moving fast unlike any other type of trading, where one is constant or at least relatively constant...
2652 2018-01-05 21:11:14 Yep hopefully
2653 2018-01-05 21:11:00 Hello! Please tell us about your order! Did you use our site or app? What currency did you use to buy crypto? And when did you make a purchase?
2654 2018-01-05 21:10:43 Timmmmmeh!
2655 2018-01-05 21:10:36 Out of the ocean of intelligent minds that dwell in crypto, someone will figure out a better way to transact with merchants, without the help of visa...
2656 2018-01-05 21:10:35 What happens when people take their tax returns and invest it in crypto... that's my plan.There could be problems if a lot of people do the same.
2657 2018-01-05 21:10:33 Bitcoin please stop. I like that you are recovering but not in favor of alts man. Don't do this to me, every time you rise alts are dumping. I don't like this behavior. What do you think? #BTC #eth

2661 2018-01-05 21:10:15 Maybe it's more useful to learn about crypto and the projects first, then learn about TA. People will just need some fundamental knowledge. I don't even think that he thinks TA is useless. For me it reads more like advice to the new guys here.

2665 2018-01-05 21:10:01 i get it. The crypto coins have created too many dead beats who spend time on twitter. BTW US became a banana republic under  #obama - else why would democrats bend over backwards for illegal immigrants, say no to voter ID and try to control everything?
2666 2018-01-05 21:09:53 Good day for the #cryptocurrency plays. Some exciting action on $MXL.ca EOD. Crypto miner in the works!
2667 2018-01-05 21:09:47 neat! sort of like @openfolio for crypto
2668 2018-01-05 21:09:42 昔からファンである
2669 2018-01-05 21:09:42 If all fiat-crypto on and off ramps were to suddenly close, would crypto thrive or die. Would we build more ramps for tangible goods exchange or use OpenBazar. Or would it just all die. A few years ago I would have said die now I think there is enough value and momentum to live.
2670 2018-01-05 21:09:41 When it comes to #Crypto we need to throw the rulebook out the window. You can't argue about price valuation of a coin based on overall limit in market cap, coins are created out of thin air and developers just dream up a max-coin circulation. market cap is a meaningless variable
2671 2018-01-05 21:09:17 For all those who are uncertain. Change is coming. #darkpoolsociety #Crypto
2672 2018-01-05 21:09:14 Holding into the weekend $CSSI $INMG $MJLB and $ADHC 3 pots and 1 crypto

2675 2018-01-05 21:09:10 I've been told atleast 10 different coins in the last day
2676 2018-01-05 21:09:10 It will keep going up with more integrations that come its way, and the more people get in to invest, simple as, crypto is not for the purists anymore but for the common people on the net
2677 2018-01-05 21:09:05 It’s called Crypto Pro I like the clean look of it!

2686 2018-01-05 21:08:13 I mean, if you wanna give away a bit coin, I'll take it.  I have no clue what I'll do with it besides make snarky comments to everyone I meet like.

"Yeah, I'm kinda into crypto, I have a full bitcoin."
2687 2018-01-05 21:08:13 #Bitcoin going on a nice bull run right now. After all this love for the ALTs I was wondering when this was going to happen haha!

2693 2018-01-05 21:07:49 Best one advance ever. And without my largest holding $KWG doing anything, but like SX, KWG, has large deposit, patent for reduction, and doing a crypto currency backed by Chromite. Yes much larger float, but .02 easy 10-20 bagger
2694 2018-01-05 21:07:48 But network effects isn’t the value proposition for xrp... its cost saving to institutional actors

Why would institutions want to transact in a volatile currency controlled by a third party they have no control over?
2695 2018-01-05 21:07:45 If you weren’t in the stock or crypto market this week you missed out on those gains 
2696 2018-01-05 21:07:40 Awesome! Love this project, it will be huuuge 
2697 2018-01-05 21:07:35 SONM is an undervalued project.
2698 2018-01-05 21:07:33 3/ So yes you're correct in that it does not radically effect these two protocols. Was just trying to provide examples of some that rely on ERC20 standard, which $salt and $eos weren't the best options.
2699 2018-01-05 21:07:27 Yo whats up everybody it’s your not crypto zay!

2713 2018-01-05 21:06:42 Dont really see ltc as an expensive coin to use or eth for that matter. Interesting that you came to this conclusion while shilling bcash. And good on you coming up with 3 uses per week for any crypto. Not even sarcasm more than i have used

2722 2018-01-05 21:06:08 Thats comparing apples to fishcakes,Pos devices require electricty, atms require electricity to depense cash, every card provider requires an entire legion of people (all in offices which require electricity) just to handle charge backs. I could go on but you get the point.
2723 2018-01-05 21:06:04 Hocam amele lazımsa burdayız...
2724 2018-01-05 21:06:00 you can short XRP on several crypto exchanges
2725 2018-01-05 21:05:57 Yeah. And without sounding conspiratorial - a global currency and ‘new world order’ has been a longstanding goal of many. 

Something like a gold-backed special drawing right crypto wouldn’t go astray. Cashless society is terrifying, but you’re already seeing it with India etc.
2726 2018-01-05 21:05:55 I’ve only been in the crypto game for a few weeks. I also don’t know if these wallets support the coins I own(DRGN and FUN).
2727 2018-01-05 21:05:53 Im serious...
2728 2018-01-05 21:05:52 Glad you changed your view on this #Altcoin
2729 2018-01-05 21:05:52 It's my best crypto currency pun.
2730 2018-01-05 21:05:48 Cmon @BittrexExchange @richiela
2731 2018-01-05 21:05:45 Agreed. Love the tech, brand & company but as they say.. a week is like a month in the crypto world! Lot's of serious gains to be had everywhere (and that's why we're all here to be brutally honest) That news today will keep me holding for now ;)
2732 2018-01-05 21:05:40 Do you think that @RaiBlocks will solve all $btc transaction speed issues? Increadibly fast transaction speed can change crypto world!
2733 2018-01-05 21:05:38 When I find out a coin went up 300%?
2734 2018-01-05 21:05:37 You know it!
2735 2018-01-05 21:05:37 @bitcoinprivate hi, may I know where would I receive BTCP’s dividends from ZCL if I purchase ZCL on bittrex?

2747 2018-01-05 21:04:44 FWIW..The average #RippleTard has a Twitter account with less than 15 followers. #XRP is the Amway of the crypto-community.. just much less intelligent.
2748 2018-01-05 21:04:37 This almost seems too easy...

Hope it doesn’t come to an end anytime soon.  Have you made 20% or more on your investment into #cryptocurrency?

2749 2018-01-05 21:04:37 it doesn't help that ARM calls multiple things "TrustZone", including their crypto coprocessors and the mostly unrelated v8-M thing which is actually useful

2752 2018-01-05 21:04:28 Wouldn’t mind bullshit like this but tagging the official page is just giving $TRX a bad image..

2762 2018-01-05 21:04:07 Bitcoin yükselişleri haberlere dayalı. Sistemsel sıkıntılar devam etmekte. Ancak haberler yeni crypto currency yatırımcıları yaratacağından uzun vadede bu yatırımcılar diğer coinlere geçecek ve sağlam crypto currency'lere olumlu etki yapacaktır.
2763 2018-01-05 21:03:53 relaz brotha, xvg is long term hodl. Come back in dec and chck your coins
2764 2018-01-05 21:03:45 2/ And yes indeed, EOS has nothing to do with ETH (when fully operational). For now, EOS tokens are based on the ERC20 standard and being handled by the Ethereum network. This is only temporary which is what you were getting at so my apologies for vagueness.
2765 2018-01-05 21:03:44 I was wondering where goes the dividend goes because bittrex doesn’t give dividends like binance does?
2766 2018-01-05 21:03:43 Yup, my best guess is that most people still have 0% exposure to crypto right now.
2767 2018-01-05 21:03:42 Educate yourself. Stop picturing Crypto as a get rich quick scheme.. these are long term investments.

2770 2018-01-05 21:03:21 til; the advantage of semilogarithmic scale usage is that it allows you to compare coins with difference prices because it represents the data in percentages. Nice!

2785 2018-01-05 21:02:16 Thank you for clarifying! I'm being swayed to anarcho-capitalism too, and discovering a big rift between us and "crypto-nationalists." I'm sure we won't see these systems for quite some time, but it's good to have an idea of what lies ahead.

2788 2018-01-05 21:02:13 Hi Guys,
After Reviewing everything going on around the Crypto industry. I came to the conclusion there will a bunch of new 2018 millionaire, but the question can they keep to the money?
2789 2018-01-05 21:02:07 Lol it’s just a scam to get more followers.. Adds 500 every time it hits the goal
2790 2018-01-05 21:02:01 I told a guy at work about crypto and he said he's buying gold. Because yellow poorly divisible/transmittable rocks are "time tested." He doesn't realize that crypto is going to eat away gold's value because it is a better hedge against fiat inflation.
2791 2018-01-05 21:01:56 the space is growing . binance and bittrex arent accepting new traders. dont worry tho, #crypto isnt going anywhere and there are plenty more opportunities. dont #FOMO. just chill, get some $DGB and $SC. big news upcoming. also, $WABI on binance!
2792 2018-01-05 21:01:52 @CivitareseLuke @adamciv46
2793 2018-01-05 21:01:51 This. Absolutely this. The cost of my place already nearly doubled and it hasn't even been 4 years yet.... I dunno if I even want to sell it anymore. It can just keep going up. I think people should also be actively investing into their 401k/IRA/etc. Not just crypto!!!
2794 2018-01-05 21:01:42 A lot of exponential growth is happening in crypto as more people start to understand it.

2799 2018-01-05 21:01:14 Donc quand tu vois que le BTC monte, tu vas aussi voir que tes ALTS vont baisser. Donc tu as le choix de laisser en alt et subir des pertes, ou aller dans le BTC et avoir des profits. C'est la base du trading en crypto.
2800 2018-01-05 21:01:12 was this a trademark issue or something?
2801 2018-01-05 21:01:09 Much appreciated! I feel that if we contribute as a community and help get this thing lifted.. the sky is the limit. The tech speaks for itself.

2823 2018-01-05 20:59:02 Soon enough, I'm going to write an article on what I learnt building a crypto currency
2824 2018-01-05 20:58:59 My boss is really getting into crypto currency and I'm having to learn so much more than I ever wanted to in helping her buy it.
2825 2018-01-05 20:58:50 Cards don't need to be remade every 1mb of transactions though

With a market cap of 100.000.000.000 coins ppl need to invest 
3.000.000.000.000 $USD in your coin
AT THE MOMENT the whole market cap off ALL crypto is 700.000.000.000! 
That is why #XVG will go much higher, 84% less coins FTW
2828 2018-01-05 20:58:42 Wild BITCONNECT  SHILL appeared!  BITCONNECT SHILL used "ITS NOT A SCAM"!  But it failed.

2830 2018-01-05 20:58:23 Paccoin wow! Not really amazed lol. Up 500% can we hit 1000%? I don’t think it should be an issue.
2831 2018-01-05 20:58:20 Will do tonight. There are others on my slack not just me. No offence but didn't get anywhere with my last support ticket on balance updates. Stop limits stopped working yesterday
2832 2018-01-05 20:58:18 Can you dispute the fact that there are millions of business around the world that are centralized & these centralized entities are profitable to the point people want to invest money in them? What’s the difference with crypto? XRP can be profitable just like your favorite crypto
2833 2018-01-05 20:58:12 As for crypto as a SOV, it could be. But is it as remotely ready for prime time, anywhere near as robust as #AU? What is a resounding no for 100 trillion, Alex?
2834 2018-01-05 20:58:07 @SethKush @TheJohnSenning @TheSoulbrother why do you think crypto currencies are doing so well? People are tired of having the government tell them what they can /cannot do with their money
2835 2018-01-05 20:57:58 LOL :-) "Spiked 4.88%..." in crypto world it's a correction :-)
2836 2018-01-05 20:57:57 Yes, it is true

2840 2018-01-05 20:57:29 Blockchain technology will ultimately make much of the bureaucratic horde outdated. This is the true reason for all the badmouthing of crypto right now. Watch how real estate embraces the security & cost saving of blockchain

2857 2018-01-05 20:55:58 How much energy does our current global financial system use, worldwide?

Do we have a way to compare or do we just say crypto can't replace because it will use too much juice?

Serious question. I have no idea how to compare the two.

2868 2018-01-05 20:55:13 Mee too
2869 2018-01-05 20:55:12 Certainly, I agree whole heartedly. But its still something people need to master. Trading crypto is too fast for most to react. 9 times out of 10 they'll miss their entry, be too afraid to get back in and move to another coin and then the old one has continued its movement up.
2870 2018-01-05 20:55:02 I have no idea which one of you guys was saying you was in on #arn #aeron yesterday but you're killing it right now with your 300+% gain. congrats!
2871 2018-01-05 20:55:01 agree with no crypto is ready for full blown RL usage. but don't agree with LTC is best setup. Especially bc I see the lightning network being push as the next step solution and i feel it only makes matters worse, not better. my opinion from my analysis though.
2872 2018-01-05 20:55:01 Used to love weekends when I had a job, start hating them after stocks, started liking them double after Crypto. This is too much!!
2873 2018-01-05 20:55:01 Hi, i haven’t got a hardware wallet yet, because I just recently joined the crypto business and haven’t made enough to invest in one, if I get a hardware wallet, I will invest more money so that I can use it to store assets.
Thank you in advance and congratulations on the target.
2874 2018-01-05 20:54:59 Помните, что криптовалюты, которые выросли за месяц в 15, 20, 30, 40 или даже больше раз рано или поздно испытают серьезную коррекцию вплоть до 40-80%. Особенно когда росту способствовал лишь большей степени хайп.

2917 2018-01-05 20:51:56 I agree that’s why this arena of investing is super scary, eventually everyone is going to say “hey, wtf do I get out of putting money into crypto?” This will happen when the amount of new money slows down and starts leveling prices
2918 2018-01-05 20:51:49 lol, I can’t tell if he’s trolling

2931 2018-01-05 20:50:45 I follow many TA accounts and appreciate the analysis but 95% of my positions and gains do not rely on TA. To each his own...
2932 2018-01-05 20:50:44 If you're the superstitious type, you may appreciate this. Yesterday I was bragging to my wife about the amazing gains (unrealized) in our crypto portfolio. And although it's 'mostly' recovered by now, I won't be making that mistake again!
Knock, knock on wood. 
2933 2018-01-05 20:50:43 Should be a good day for alts so long as BTC doesnt break 165 resistance - even still stochrsi is peaked on 6hr chart - probably a more sideways action and a mixed market.
2934 2018-01-05 20:50:43 Ya definitely right, technical analysis doesn't work well in crypto due to the fact that the is not being traded due to past history but rather purely speculation.
2935 2018-01-05 20:50:40 Yes very true.

2990 2018-01-05 20:46:24 By your analysis, I think some people have bought into crypto-currencies that have already gone up a a lot, and they are going to lose the lot. And I think you're right. But I don't know which currencies.
2991 2018-01-05 20:46:21 Gonz I gotta ask...isn’t crypto currency right in line with the whole mark o’ the beast thingy?  Mark on forehead and or right hand, not being able to buy or sell stuff?  Just wondering

2996 2018-01-05 20:45:56 You can hold coins on the site (although not necessarily advised), the 'log in' process is essentially putting in your wallet key or using a google chrome extension such as Metamask which puts in the wallet address for you.

2999 2018-01-05 20:45:50 That's the development part of this I was referring to and what I meant by saying it's not where it will be eventually. Literally no crypto is ready for full blown RL usage yet, but LTC is best setup to be the one when it happens.

3001 2018-01-05 20:45:44 lol that guy is the CEO of ripple, he's interest is that the public perception of it is good. The journalist I retweeted is highly respected in the crypto community. I think I'll take his word over a corrupt CEO.

3011 2018-01-05 20:44:59 One of maybe a handful of YouTube crypto guys with integrity and decency. Good for you Bobby , love the vids.
3012 2018-01-05 20:44:58 Also, if I read you correctly, you say you sympathize with crypto-nationalists because they'd be have high trust, low crime, and would peacefully integrate outsiders? This just sounds straight up racist. Where do you live with such high crime rates?
3013 2018-01-05 20:44:52 Oh my. No sleep with crypto

3018 2018-01-05 20:44:37 Right on! I'm from Rio but grew up in Florida. The rarri down there is a big target on your head for sure. Still a dope test drive :)
3019 2018-01-05 20:44:36 Harry, there is no context with the photo.  Hopefully the pelts will be used, the state conservation agency sanctioned the kills(if by humans) and university/education involvement will benefit. At least two of wolves are tagged, so that gives me some hope.

3023 2018-01-05 20:44:21 Was just approached by a beggar who asked me if I could spare some Bitcoins and a crypto exchange account for converting those Bitcoins into Ripple currency.
3024 2018-01-05 20:44:21 I think he means it doesn't have to be reported the same way it will be in 2018. We have to pay taxes for our capitol gains for 2017 just not for every transaction

3026 2018-01-05 20:44:14 Crypto twitter is a constant loop of self fulfilling prophesies. Someone with a decent following shills a “gem” of a coin, raising awareness leading to an influx of demand. Coin goes up in price, resulting in added “credibility” for the shiller. Rinse repeat.

3041 2018-01-05 20:43:02 #Altcoins don't HAVE to dump when #Bitcoin rises. The inverse relation isn't some algorithm. It just traders panic selling one for the other. 

its so bad, people panic sell as fast as they can to beat the panic sellers. 

I hope the market can one day mature past this.

3063 2018-01-05 20:41:21 Remember #TRX $TRX #TRON Coinburn in 4 days. Price will go up.
3064 2018-01-05 20:41:19 we are well aware of that. There is no plan to cut out grid operators. Middleman is retailer or broker that is buying cheaper energy and sell it on a higher price.
3065 2018-01-05 20:41:18 There is no right answer, especially in crypto.  If you sold the -15% it could easily go up + %30 the next minute, hour, day.  And you have basically sold the dip and bombed out.  Without abd supporting information as to why its low, you cant make a judgment.

This is fact!
3066 2018-01-05 20:41:18 Paying bills with Bitcoin by itself is perfectly legal of course but you should definitely consult a tax lawyer for clarification on how to declare your gains !

3072 2018-01-05 20:40:46 any small dose of real life into LTC would break LTC like a tooth pick. my beef is that he called it the payments coin. when all the data proves is that it can handle modern day crypto demands. payments coin = real life application 2/2
3073 2018-01-05 20:40:43 If it’s too good to be true than it probably is. No way anyone can pay you a guaranteed positive return. Even gov’t bonds yielded negative returns during the recession. #ponzi

Centralized crypto has a place im sure.But not for transactional/wealth holding imo. I think you should focus on the technologys surrounding the blockchain technology rather than what coin may make u a few$

I am hearing if you live in the U.S. you need to report every transaction you made from every exchange and when you sell a #crypto for another crypto thats a sale ?
3147 2018-01-05 20:36:24 Dont pull full moron. They will be disapointed when they will see $TRX deposit is down on #hitbtc
3148 2018-01-05 20:36:22 On the morning of January 4, TRON (TRX) registered a 136 percent increase, becoming the 9th largest crypto-currency by market capitalization and pushing the Dash to 11th place.
3149 2018-01-05 20:36:15 Nah but I'm going to #Cryptochella.
3150 2018-01-05 20:36:13 How about both?
3151 2018-01-05 20:36:11 Just sent 0.000001 $btc to 'bitcoinking' on @Cryptopia_NZ. Just filled in a random username to transfer them to. Can't handle 0.000001 btc on my balance with my autism. #btc #bitcoin #cryptopia

3153 2018-01-05 20:35:59 @hitbtc 
What's up with my USDT withdrawal from your site?? It's been sitting in pending status for almost 36 hours!!
3154 2018-01-05 20:35:57 I’ve been trying to buy swtfcoin for a couple days now and can’t figure out how to or where to go?   I am very new to crypto but would like to learn.  Where can I get swftcoin?   I tried HitBTC but all review are negative and okex is Chinese market.  Is there is market?
3155 2018-01-05 20:35:54 Geçmiş olsun Volkan bey.
3156 2018-01-05 20:35:48 Trying to be less reflexively racist but living in an apartment underneath a black "family" that screams at each other and at their children, blasts rap at all hours of the day and have parties every single week is really testing my resolve.
3157 2018-01-05 20:35:44 Loosing the integrity in Cryptocurrency after seeing the $XRP in 2nd and $bitconnect in 20th. Why would you do this people?
3158 2018-01-05 20:35:40 42
3159 2018-01-05 20:35:37 Hell yeah.
3160 2018-01-05 20:35:35 Il mio consiglio è di entrare su #IOTA .buon progetto e ottima resa nei prossimi giorni. #Crypto #cryptocurrency #BlockChain
3161 2018-01-05 20:35:28 No not refusing profit to screw others. The R/R just wasn't good enough. I had a touch of FOMO fever and NSF brought me back down to Earth to try to protect me from making a bad play.
3162 2018-01-05 20:35:25 Thats only in tails bro not in crypto world.. with XVG slow we only see it drowning if it doesnt speed up...
3163 2018-01-05 20:35:22 Hi where do u guys buy xrp? Pls guide me pls
3164 2018-01-05 20:35:20 Thanks for taking my joke with good humour! I’ve been blocked for less 
3165 2018-01-05 20:35:19 ripple is no crypto, no scarcity, no mining, no fairness
3166 2018-01-05 20:35:17 This would be great. I'm trying to learn ta but it's a big field and difficult  to identify basics when you don't come from a finance background
3167 2018-01-05 20:35:17 True that. At times I was questioning them as well, but was too busy with work to actively trade at that time.
$DNR is also good coin with great future I believe. @carsenjk knows what he's doing and good things to come with MN etc.
3168 2018-01-05 20:35:16 WTF
3169 2018-01-05 20:35:09 なぜビットコイナーとリップラーが相入れないか考えた。ビットコインは「いかにそのバリューを裏付けるか」に重きを置き、リップルは「いかに送金バリューをもたらすか」に重きを置いてるからだ。それはわかりあえないよね。イーサはそもそも路線が違う。実はイーサが1番どきついモデルな気がするけど
3170 2018-01-05 20:35:05 No no no these stats are BS
3171 2018-01-05 20:35:04 Well on that tweet I think I need a large glass of red wine 
3172 2018-01-05 20:34:55 You also maybe shouldn't put on your public twitter profile how you're going to evade taxes while also using #IRS #TAX #FuckTheIRS might come back to haunt you in the upcoming years when you incorporate your business and crypto tax laws are stricter
3173 2018-01-05 20:34:54 They must be holding back some of Nick's referral fees, cause otherwise I think he is smart enough to jump ship and just count his chips.
3174 2018-01-05 20:34:51 The problem with Crypto at the moment is everyones focused on how much 'market cap' a coin has. Currently there are some undeserved 'coins' atop the list. Due to marketing and wide speculation from Newbies thinking they will get rich quick. Certainly its possible if you buy/sell.
3175 2018-01-05 20:34:50 Hodl
3176 2018-01-05 20:34:41 Same issue! Glad it’s not just me!
3177 2018-01-05 20:34:39 Crypto is the only thing you will trade and look at a 29.81% gain and say it is not enough to sell
3178 2018-01-05 20:34:39 $crypto is picking up more traction
3179 2018-01-05 20:34:38 Doubt it
3180 2018-01-05 20:34:37 @PACcoinCZAR hey I have PAC have never used wallets though as I am new so just HODL on yobit. What's the bonus all about?
3181 2018-01-05 20:34:36 Hehehe are you a master of crypto currency?
3182 2018-01-05 20:34:24 Unfortunately xvg is dead, i dont see a recovery anytime soon and if it does eventually moon, no one is going to keep their money i their
3183 2018-01-05 20:34:08 Well in all fairness, they had a working product. Now every crypto card issuer is back to square one. No one has functional cards out yet. So right now it depends who starts issuing the cards out first.
3184 2018-01-05 20:34:07 This feed has turned from a decent source for crypto discussion into a weird kind of sausage fest.
3185 2018-01-05 20:34:05 Twitter users who bought $100 worth of #bitcoin last week are now putting “BTC” in their name, their bio has “bitcoin investor”, and now are thinking of creating a #YouTube channel and naming it “Crypto (insert first name)”.
3186 2018-01-05 20:34:03 For all those who are uncertain. Change is coming. #darkpoolsociety #Crypto

3192 2018-01-05 20:33:30 but he has crypto in his name.......not legit?
3193 2018-01-05 20:33:23 It's not about preventing someone else's profit necessarily. Would you rather cash out someone else's 1000x to enter your own 2x, or find your own 1000x?
3194 2018-01-05 20:33:15 @c4chaos rt my crypto poll and pass the GMO on $BTC v alts 
3195 2018-01-05 20:33:14 Thanks Women in Crypto for the follow.
3196 2018-01-05 20:33:13 If your new to crypto. Take time to learn the connection between Erik  and Rodger Ver. Both criminals. And somehow they are trustworthy. Would  you do business with a Criminal Banker? Why would you in the Crypto  space. Search Tether, bitfinex and Rodger Ver
3197 2018-01-05 20:32:58 look at how Tron communicates, copy that and you might get people back. Until then piss off you duds!
3198 2018-01-05 20:32:55 The best part about dips in crypto is that I’m never home near the computer to panic sell. Lol. Always hodling.
3199 2018-01-05 20:32:54 I am also on my PhD but more than 70% attention is on Crypto
3200 2018-01-05 20:32:53 What's all this Crypto stuff?
3201 2018-01-05 20:32:53 I'm not disparaging $HTML just saying that at the time the fundamentals weren't pretty and my risk managment cost me this play, but it led to another one with $DNR
3202 2018-01-05 20:32:45 Crypto currency RT @JockinYani: I need $2,000. Somebody tell me how to get it.
3203 2018-01-05 20:32:41 Agreed, and once #XVG gets it's warranted positive press and praise it's going to be the next #BTC . IMO, I think there are some powerful people out there that don't like the anonymity and other factions that view #XVG as a threat to the validity of their own crypto.
3204 2018-01-05 20:32:39 Ok, I'll bite, tell me why?
3205 2018-01-05 20:32:39 I followed does this mean I win?
3206 2018-01-05 20:32:31 Вы с России ?

3209 2018-01-05 20:32:21 So true
3210 2018-01-05 20:32:19 If they want they can contact our payment processors and ask them where the funds came funds (these payments are pooled with many other services) but they wouldn't do that unless they are doing an investigation for money laundering
3211 2018-01-05 20:32:17 Yes

Tell me why you like it, convince me otherwise, if you will.
3212 2018-01-05 20:32:14 I'm not a fanboy and also not a creator of verge and now you're right, it is uncertain  but  who knows.. crypto is a chance -for short term-

3214 2018-01-05 20:32:07 Cheers for getting me into spec mining. i would love more tweets or information about how i can improve my spec mining plays!
3215 2018-01-05 20:32:05 That's true. You can litteraly get instant depression when you look back on all the "almost" and "should have" in this space. And nothing beats good FA.
3216 2018-01-05 20:32:04 If you want to rationalize the way you behave with some grandiose conception of evolution, go ahead. It's clear to me crypto-nationalists just have a hard-on for keeping people out, ie. away from their womens.
3217 2018-01-05 20:32:01 $TRX surge, wait for the next surge when the Asians from the East wake up lol. They love them $TRX and $XRP, that I know, and I love watching my bank account as well.

HODL and be there when the train arrive.
3218 2018-01-05 20:31:58 Don't thank me man, you were the one who executed the $DNR mining strategy that KILLED IT 
3219 2018-01-05 20:31:54 (subscriber here) thanks for the new crypto names, Ronnie. Hopefully they go up but whatever happens, happens!
3220 2018-01-05 20:31:49 #HODL
3221 2018-01-05 20:31:40 @ClearOpenDoor stack your #TRX and #XLM youll thank me when your port increases %250 in 4 weeks. ;D
3222 2018-01-05 20:31:33 I want to send some BTC from Coinbase to Binance to buy some XRP but the fee is to high for the transfer, any suggestions? #xrp #ripple #btc #bitcoin #usd #coinbase #binance #crypto
3223 2018-01-05 20:31:27 No. Most people have had banks accounts shut down after withdrawing funds from an exchange. This doesn't happen with credit cards using bylls
3224 2018-01-05 20:31:23 They don't deserve an @
3225 2018-01-05 20:31:17 Took 8 hours for ETH yesterday for me about 3 hours doing LTC last night as well.
3226 2018-01-05 20:31:15 #trx #ico #crypto Invested BTC to TRX because of TRX Dogs launching. Buy dogs, they're so cool. Please. Pleeeease.
3227 2018-01-05 20:31:13 My name's Steve (I'm not Joe Blockchain), but because your not-so-subtle-as-you-think Crypto scare tactics have been so obvious, as are your interests, you have been a bit of an anti-oracle in this space... other than if you wait long enough everything goes down and up.
3228 2018-01-05 20:31:11 I've been hyping #Paccoin folks. Told you I wouldn't steer you wrong. We're up 366% right now.

3230 2018-01-05 20:31:03 ギリギリで $PAC 手に入れていて助かった
3231 2018-01-05 20:30:58 today i am very tired, i have not done what i planned but i am thinking that many businesses that want to implement real stuff with blockchain should go with investing into phd topics in the applied crypto area or in general, to address the 'trust' topics to support phd student
3232 2018-01-05 20:30:57 Ter nuancering: de winkeliers betaalden deze transactiekosten niet; uit bescherming van de betalende klant en BitKassa is de beslissing genomen om even pas op de plaats te maken. Het fenomeen crypto is erg nieuw, daardoor ook ongekende uitdagingen :-)
3233 2018-01-05 20:30:44 Oh I agree, but it will still be a huge event in crypto. There's definitely room for both for different things, even the CEO of #ripple is long on #BTC
3234 2018-01-05 20:30:44 HODL!
3235 2018-01-05 20:30:42 Pour les projets, j'ai lu les sites officiels de chaque crypto qui me semblait intéressante. Après il y a énormément de paramètres à prendre en compte (le standing de l'équipe, le potentiel marketing etc) mais la première chose à voir c'est l'utilité à moyen terme de la crypto
3236 2018-01-05 20:30:36 Tam da sayfamda üstadımın da bahsettiği neye göre coin seçimi yapmalıdan bahsetmiştim. Bi göz atmanız faydalı olabilir...
3237 2018-01-05 20:30:33 Hmm, refusing to make profit to prevent smb else's profit. @CRYPTOBANGer made a x30 if his word is to be believed. Interesting story though, notifications for @notsofast tweets turned on as of now!
3238 2018-01-05 20:30:31 Welcome to Crypto investing. If you want to invest in 100% sure stability,  you can put your money in Certificate of Deposit.
3239 2018-01-05 20:30:28 First crypto tweet 27th december boy is he in for a shock
3240 2018-01-05 20:30:23 So are we going all in on $html or what?
3241 2018-01-05 20:30:20 A year ago crypto had a market cap of 19 Billion, today it’s 750B. It’s an exploding industry and you’d be foolish to not at least look into it.
3242 2018-01-05 20:30:19 The article I read on ripple crypto currency,The future is bright in 2018
3243 2018-01-05 20:30:16 What was the last crypto you invested in ?!
3244 2018-01-05 20:30:15 It was my best crypto currency pun.

3247 2018-01-05 20:29:53 Best recommended COIN tracking wallet/ application?

3250 2018-01-05 20:29:41 Took me 2.5 hours last night to transfer ltc from coinbase
3251 2018-01-05 20:29:41 No. Crypto doesn't take vacation time
3252 2018-01-05 20:29:36 Why is that? What do you like about bitshares?
3253 2018-01-05 20:29:34 Wie vorhin vermutet, erholen sich die altcoins. Besonders #trx wieder im Anflug. Aktuell bei 24 Cent!

3254 2018-01-05 20:29:34 Commence par te renseigner sur comment fonctionne les marchés en crypto, les spécificités, puis si tu veux acheter autre chose que de l'ETH ou du LTC (ceux listés sur coinbase) commence doucement sur Binance, genre 50eu le temps de comprendre comment ça fonctionne.
3255 2018-01-05 20:29:30 Most probably they have been transferred to other exchanges so that they can buy the hottest crypto #TRX, #XRP,#ADA,#XLM,#ETH

3260 2018-01-05 20:29:10 Not at all. My point is to never lose sight of fundamentals and also never regret plays you *almost* made because there's always another play to make
3261 2018-01-05 20:29:09 What exactly is bitconnect? How the hell did it get such a high market cap if it's a scam. Some good salesman?
3262 2018-01-05 20:29:07 I'm assuming you're intimating that power is a comparative investment to crypto or other store of value assets. And I'm saying no, they aren't.
3263 2018-01-05 20:29:04 Yea don’t buy a house or lambo before paying taxes cuz then you will have to give it all back, once they hit you with 40 percent tax !!!!
3264 2018-01-05 20:29:02 Orrrrr you think @CryptoMessiah is twice as good as everyone else. Orrrrrr you just mistyped my name.
3265 2018-01-05 20:29:02 When your Blockfolio balance becomes the key factor in feeling happy or not, hodling or trading crypto might not be the most healthiest thing for you.

When it's cheaper (and sometimes faster!) to FedEx private keys to someone than to send a digital payment, Bitcoin is no longer a P2P electronic cash system.

3274 2018-01-05 20:28:36 Well I don't plan on "cashing out" until I have incorporated my business in Wyoming and have established an overseas bank account to have no more 10k in each. Another thing, do not deposit or withdraw anything over 10k into your bank. you will be watched like a hawk. #IRS #TAX

3280 2018-01-05 20:28:19 I have nothing but respect for the $HTML guys. They are a completely new team and have pulled through really hard times with e.g. Yobit not executing the swap. Always attentive to questions, even when things went south and we hit the litoshi market in q4/2017.

3286 2018-01-05 20:27:47 Maybe next week
3287 2018-01-05 20:27:47 Watching crypto kiddies jump into old shit coins because "upside potential is huge" just because they're looking backwards at a massive pump and dump. Amusing.

Better to bet on solid tech, solid team then ride the pumps, buy the dip and HODL to massive returns.
3288 2018-01-05 20:27:44 I just bought 50 Million $PAC I'm going to talk about PAC in a video in the next day or two and why I changed my position on this crypto!

3291 2018-01-05 20:27:23 classical verge. first urging people to buy verge. when it start to increase, an unnecessary decleration and sudden decrease. I am so away from verge nowadays.
3292 2018-01-05 20:27:22 Haha I didn't even realize I did that.
3293 2018-01-05 20:27:15 Exactly, not only that but I read a tweet the other day in which the UK is demanding crypto investors turn over their crypto (#BTC) investment data -- #XVG is a good way not to get screwed by the government that wants a piece of it.. Investors will find that out soon enough.
3294 2018-01-05 20:27:12 Which group you provide crypto signals?
3295 2018-01-05 20:27:11 Two alts I'm so confident in, that I'm not gonna sell off when $BTC goes on a bull run are $FUN and $WABI. They are both still seriously undervalued coins and are worth accumulating more of 
#crypto #altcoins #bitcoin
3296 2018-01-05 20:27:07 That’s doesn’t even make much sense , if anything the IRS sends you an “invoice” of what you owe in taxes if you don’t claim it initially but idk 
3297 2018-01-05 20:27:05 @daytradernik looks like $LINX is giving us one more sale before take off. It’s been getting primed for a run for so long now. Absolutely right. Frustrating to chart.
3298 2018-01-05 20:27:03 Agreed. But there is no exchange or transfer out there for any crypto that can be done free of cost/fees. Everyone pays for the services. It is not just a safex thing. Sir tell me which crypto have you transferred around exchanges and in and out of wallets for free and reliably?
3299 2018-01-05 20:27:03 College does not mean anything, I finished medicine, have 2 master degrees, now doing PhD and no life. Crypto is bringing my old self back and much more. I am thankful for the great comunity and everything!
3300 2018-01-05 20:27:03 Nice to be up in $BTC value in this red day. $ZCL did good, $MED did excellent and will be huge whitin a few months
3301 2018-01-05 20:26:56 I believe people finally do realize that #Segwit #Bitcoin is to $XRP like a fidget spinner to space shuttle.
3302 2018-01-05 20:26:49 Cointracking is amazing, been using it a month now, uploading excel files is so much easier and accurate than doing transactions manually. They have an app which is also pretty good but at the moment they are having trouble with their servers so in time the app will work again
3303 2018-01-05 20:26:47 I don't even think he's a dev on any crypto repo. I checked his github account and he has a fork of monero, but not one contribution. Looking at his twitter profile, it seems like he doesn't really like any.
3304 2018-01-05 20:26:46 How do I sign up.. I only accept payment in crypto 
3305 2018-01-05 20:26:41 Yea let use know I’m sure if you make a lot off it they will come after you later on !!!!
3306 2018-01-05 20:26:33 @bennydoda01 Have you looked into NAS at all? Seems like a solid, unique project.
3307 2018-01-05 20:26:33 No order! Haha I am trying to do this secretly at work >_<
3308 2018-01-05 20:26:33 $start, huge upside imo

3310 2018-01-05 20:26:21 Is there a future for crypto currency in 2018?
3311 2018-01-05 20:26:20 Ok, got that one ironed out.

Now, what coin is ruderman developing for? 

Secondly, which privacy coin would he recommend since I didn't see any recommendations. What I gathered from the article is that NO COIN can be Anonymous, however he only singled out and crapped on xvg.
3312 2018-01-05 20:26:16 I'm not referring to importing a seed into Edge. This is if you are creating a wallet in Edge and you intend to export the seed or xpub into another tool which requires BIP44.

3316 2018-01-05 20:26:10 $ZCL Another Pump & Dump happening now, or is this the real deal?
3317 2018-01-05 20:26:09 oh ca va, t'y est presque :)

T'as bien les modules crypto et ce qu'il faut dans ta conf kernel ? (crypto, ciphers etc)
3318 2018-01-05 20:26:01 $DNT possibly looking to breakout? $alts $crypto

3321 2018-01-05 20:25:52 What encryption? They had an air tight firewall around the whole planet!
3322 2018-01-05 20:25:49 2018 making so much money with crypto, got lots of time with my girl and my job giving me a rise 
3323 2018-01-05 20:25:46 Yea bro like you can do tuition reimbursement on turbo tax. Hunter will send you a form (I forgot the number) and it’s a write off..
3324 2018-01-05 20:25:45 next week!
3325 2018-01-05 20:25:41 Seems a bit odd how he works for a huge IT company, but still all he tweets is crypto and skin giveaways, seems odd for someone that should be well off if he indeed is telling the truth. But to each his own I guess
3326 2018-01-05 20:25:39 @SatoshiLite I would love to interview you for my youtube channel. Lots of new people getting into crypto who might not know much about you. Lets get the word out to the new people about #Litecoin
3327 2018-01-05 20:25:36  If you tell how much cryptocurrency you hold, you are naive,, If you don't tell them you are a liar
3328 2018-01-05 20:25:36 Im pretty sure that was a loop hole that was just fixed in the new tax bill. Also hearing that if you dont report it, they can seize 100% percent of assests you didnt report taxes on
3329 2018-01-05 20:25:34 BTC’nin 16.500$ yani bu seviyelerden geriye doğru çekileceğini düşünüyorum. 15.000$ seviyelerinde yine bir soluklanma yaşar. Zararda olan pozisyonlarınızı tutmaya devam etmenizi öneririm. 15.000$ seviyelerinde altlardan yavaş yavaş çıkmak gerek...
3330 2018-01-05 20:25:34 Panic?
3331 2018-01-05 20:25:31 So, this climb is another "stay away". Scam coin relaunch?
3332 2018-01-05 20:25:24 Everyone wants the quick path to weath, but metrics show that is typically not sustainable.  Not for lottory winners, not for brands of crypto, not for poorly-conceived software...er...spectacles companies... #CheddarLIVE
3333 2018-01-05 20:25:22 @coinbase regarding #LTC When I sell you guys charge $3 lesser than the market rate per coin, and when I want to buy you guys charge $4  over the market rate. Plus $5 coinbase fee. hmmm  #Shady #Crypto
3334 2018-01-05 20:25:19 There's a story behind that XD
3335 2018-01-05 20:25:16 YASSSS I made the cut! Barely. LOL. Thank you!
3336 2018-01-05 20:25:10 so @visa cracking down on crypto debit cards is their retaliation for 2x failure huh??  
none ever uses them anyway!!

3340 2018-01-07 23:59:37 Did you threaten to murder someone Roger? Gotta get that temper under control guy, or you'll have a heart attack before you're 40.  Maybe go work on your project to create a voluntaryist country, and take a break from crypto.

3381 2018-01-07 23:57:41 Well I usually just go to website of the coin I'm looking for, read their whitepaper/roadmap and get as much info as I can from their website. Most of the time that's enough info for a basic decision on a crypto. The website is usually like a portfolio, it needs to impress me
3382 2018-01-07 23:57:41 I'm seeing a lot of reports from economists which suggest that crypto investors will lose out as well in that scenario. I don't think there is anything we can do to be honest. Rothschilds/Zionists are in the process of taking over the world. Everybody will be screwed. :/

3410 2018-01-07 23:54:49 Yes marketing isn't their strong suit but that's OK, this isn't a P&D.  this is a solid long term project that is growing organically.  So not to worry, once this rocket takes off you will look back on this price in a few months and give your left nut to have it again.
3411 2018-01-07 23:54:48 When did I do this? I mean really i went over my tweets did i say something?

3431 2018-01-07 23:53:07 Ok but what is your workflow to keep the profit of alts?
1. Sell ALT to BTC.
2.1. Keep some BTC to buy new ALT

Right?
3432 2018-01-07 23:53:03 I've been reflecting on the scope of #iota. Bitfinex and binance are not inventing new registrations, and more and more people are accessing the market where they have crypto coins, this has not very limited the wide dissemination? #criptocoin #IOTA #access

3435 2018-01-07 23:52:54 I think crypto is close to its ~2000 crash now. Doesn’t mean it goes away, just a major winnowing soon.
3436 2018-01-07 23:52:54 I was told that happens because of the negative balance in one of your wallets. They say you'll be able to withdraw once that negative balance is paid back.
However, can someone explain how it's even possible to own a negative balance in crypto?

3467 2018-01-07 23:50:04 Great points. Another thing to consider is relative size of frontrunners vs latecomers. If latter is much larger, won't have to worry as much about competition. Going back to the Bitcoin example, I believe $ able to buy BTC on a crypto exchange is dwarfed by $ able to buy ETFs.

3513 2018-01-07 23:45:45 We actually view $TRON and $ADA to be almost equally vaporwareish. The main difference is that @Cardano_ is shilled by Western crypto "celebs" while @TronFoundation is shilled by Chinese ones.

Never buy a bag you aren’t happy to hold on to for a while. Always buy projects you believe in - so if it dips you don’t panic sell for someone else’s gain.

3517 2018-01-07 23:45:22 Yes. Their core competency is not as a crypto fund, which they act as if they hold.
On the other hand, it's a nice idea to force holding if you feel strongly - like Ben Franklin (?) with his city donations.
3518 2018-01-07 23:45:17 If you could eradicate poverty or hunger you see everyday near you, just by donating your crypto, would you do it?

3577 2018-01-07 23:41:16 Hope not. What would be the point then of having a decentralised crypto with no fees and government interference. Would just end up being online versions of existing currencies using blockchain tech.
3578 2018-01-07 23:41:13 Why not you just have to put you trust in a guy that his under pants are so tasty he wants to eat them.
3579 2018-01-07 23:41:10 New crypto contra indicator......Yaaay!
3580 2018-01-07 23:41:10 They took your Bitcoins for their shitty 0.30 cent TEX.....good job done by this cons,  crypto is the Wild West.
3581 2018-01-07 23:41:05 Am finding there are moments now where u work so hard for so long in crypto that you brain feels like it is slowly sinking into a vat of really old fat in a deep fat fryer
And then - Bam! alts-spikes/bleeds
and the adrenalin wires u up to the machine again
3582 2018-01-07 23:40:59 its amazing watching past titans of monetary thought stumble and trip over crypto endless. its a lot of fun.

3584 2018-01-07 23:40:47 Willing to sell my #crypto accounts at @Cryptopia_NZ @Poloniex @BittrexExchange for 1,5 $btc each. #crypto #bitcoin #ethereum #exchanges #sale
3585 2018-01-07 23:40:35 Don't them people have some respect for other guys work? Shame
3586 2018-01-07 23:40:34 I have Kracken, Hitbtc, Binance, hit me up if interested.

3588 2018-01-07 23:40:32 A coin that has given me 700% return on my initial investment up to now is $linda #lindacoin. A hidden gem on Cryptopia exchange. There is further room for growth with an exciting 2018 ahead! #cryptocurrency #crypto #altcoin
3589 2018-01-07 23:40:21 DeepOnion. I understand the poll, the community, even the price movement, but it feels more like Bitconnect and USI Tech in its growth and marketing methods than an actual viable crypto especially with under $100M market cap. Market cap tells a better story imo than chart growth
3590 2018-01-07 23:40:18 Crypto is a shitshow rn hope you chose your bags wisely
3591 2018-01-07 23:40:16 Did you know you can mine on your HDD #Burstcoin what a great idea. love finding all this new coins with amazing projects. Make sure to check it out and earn extra bucks with your rig. HDDs are really cheap. #Mining #cryptomining #crypto #cryptocurrency

3595 2018-01-07 23:40:03 اخي انا حولت بيتكوين من Coinbase ,الى شركة الاكتتاب واشتريت بعض التوكن واعطيتهم رقم المحفظة ER-C20
شو رايك ؟
3596 2018-01-07 23:40:01 Why on earth would Dentists just not use an established low-supply crypto like #LTC #VTC #BTC #XVG ... as opposed to 1.8 trillion for dentists-only? lmao
3597 2018-01-07 23:39:51 Can I get a follow :)

3599 2018-01-07 23:39:41 Why thank you! It's on hold and backlogged for a bit- I'll let you know when it's out  
Have you already bought crypto before?
3600 2018-01-07 23:39:41 As soon as a company can enter a bid, submit, and their content is distributed across the network, goodbye all centralized servers
 
There's a pretty well funded chinese startup building this, and it wasn't until crypto that you could even imagine compensating thousands of peers
3601 2018-01-07 23:39:38 errrr... me too? :)
3602 2018-01-07 23:39:33 Over a thousand sats again

3605 2018-01-07 23:39:14 30時間以上経っても未承認の送金がありました。

この送金は，結局2週間以上未承認のままでした。
ようやく2週間ほどしてから，承認されました(^_^;
それはちょうどリップルが安いときで，そのせいで安く買えませんでした。残念！
3606 2018-01-07 23:39:01 They are basically the same at the moment.
3607 2018-01-07 23:38:58 I like ..I like ..I like

3610 2018-01-07 23:38:35 Done
3611 2018-01-07 23:38:31 Nah I still got crypto to buy 
3612 2018-01-07 23:38:27 what would be a good starter approach for new investors?  Is there some way to formalize the approach to selling ?
3613 2018-01-07 23:38:23 At the moment and at the time of the ICO JSR (#Jincor ‘s token) will cost $1. After the end of sales, the team expects a sharp increase in the cost of the token. #ICO #blockchain #tokensale #crypto
3614 2018-01-07 23:38:22 What's hilarious is that @KaylaraOwl
condemns me for doing retweets of
"cryptocurrency and Rand Paul" ..
when in fact I'm a sceptic of crypto
.. because I think it is a bubble.

But I retweet both those "in favor"
and those "who oppose" .. because
I want to be fair and balanced.

3627 2018-01-07 23:37:31 if $MANA can establish itself above $.25 (.0000155 BTC) then anticipate a bullish run to around $.32 soon after. #Decentraland #Bittrex #crypto
3628 2018-01-07 23:37:30 I agree with you but, it's not only in crypto:

People try to get rich quick with lottery (Example) and lose a lot of money (in general) during 40 years sometimes...
3629 2018-01-07 23:37:24 I totally missed that day just due to a dead battery.. damn my phone! But still happy that u uploaded a crypto video back then in Ur main channel! It helped me get into crypto 
3630 2018-01-07 23:37:21 @Ripple It is crazy how hard it is to buy ripple shares, there has to be an easier way.@coinbase should add ripple to their selection of crypto currencies that are available to purchase. I made an account on almost all brokerage sites that sell ripple and none of them work for me
3631 2018-01-07 23:37:20 Kay I can use all info and direction you can give for Cannabis and crypto currency industries. Email me if you can
3632 2018-01-07 23:37:14 Just asking honestly, what is with the large amount of the internet complaining that it’s a scam coin / mlm / spam / referral? I love crypto as a community as a whole and privacy coins are my favorite interest but the research I found seemed more than just usual FUD.
3633 2018-01-07 23:36:56 Agreed, except I took a well needed hiatus after learning alot and losing $$. Glad to be back (immersed) in crypto twitter land.
3634 2018-01-07 23:36:49 @ChartistCrypto another bull run for icx?
3635 2018-01-07 23:36:48 Laugh it up, but that monkey got huge returns in crypto in 2017.

3637 2018-01-07 23:36:38 You are thinking correct.
3638 2018-01-07 23:36:36 Is it possible to send from an exchange?
3639 2018-01-07 23:36:35 What is new in the news of crypto?  Verge and Lite Coin going up ? Any chance ? Ethereum would be rally up?

3655 2018-01-07 23:35:16 imo in 2019 #BTC will suffer a slowly death. It served well its purpose: presented to the world this revolutionary technology and served as an entrance to $crypto during many years. Now let the old big grandpa be replaced
3656 2018-01-07 23:35:00 Yeaa.... I simply don't agree with this. If you cant write a good whitepaper how good will your code be? How will you operate the project as a business? What kind of team could you put together and manage?  This is just a crazy statement.

3677 2018-01-07 23:33:40 My favorite party of being in crypto is the drinking
3678 2018-01-07 23:33:38 Also crypto-bridge issued a notice about temporarily stop new registrations (and frozen markets too)
3679 2018-01-07 23:33:35 what is Crypto trading

3682 2018-01-07 23:33:08 Im new to crypto (1 month) and I learnt a lot of things, in top of making money, it’s a passionate topic. What a world, what a cause !

3691 2018-01-07 23:32:28 Ripple is not a crypto currency at all, it's not decentralized, it's controlled by one company, sure it will have success, but it's a simple digital currency based on block-chain technology
3692 2018-01-07 23:32:16 what is this even mean?
3693 2018-01-07 23:32:05 How do we buy this then ?
3694 2018-01-07 23:32:05 i want all crypto to crash not because i harbor ill will towards my friends but because i desperately need it to stop shitting up my tl
3695 2018-01-07 23:31:52 Yeah shoot me a message!
3696 2018-01-07 23:31:50 Hahaha being in business u gotta manipulate they all do it
3697 2018-01-07 23:31:46 It's definitely early. P2P would have been much bigger if everyone was compensated/incentivized beyond the you-scratch-my-back model, but the technology didn't exist at the time. 

I'd even argue P2P is just getting started. BitTorrent + Crypto = viable decentralized rev share

3721 2018-01-07 23:30:17 I prefer to buy low like i did with $FGF once they signaled Crypto Blockchain at 0.6c-0.7c

3761 2018-01-07 23:26:35 Crypto has the potential to be bigger than the stock market, but it’s a valid question - the truth is we don’t know, this is uncharted territory. And you’re right about the exchanges, although decentralized exchanges will further complicate that issue even though they are needed.
3762 2018-01-07 23:26:31 What other crypto you in?
3763 2018-01-07 23:26:31 I know what you mean, I had only just started in Crypto when I found out my sons Maths teacher was one of the founders sons and was spruiking Canya to his students haha. Not many funds at the time but I got in at the founder stage for a nice bonus. I like the Darwin connection.

3769 2018-01-07 23:26:01 I bought ripple understanding XRP is not a share of ripple. XRP  is the best adaptable and assblished crypto for bank transfers. I also understand mainly xcurrent is being adopted at this time with banks. Xrapid is utilization of XRP or other crypto.XRP=fastest&most secure option
3770 2018-01-07 23:25:45 My conspiracy theory is XRP is being pumped by CNBC working with the banking industry.  Both knowing full well this shit will crash hard.  After which bank industry and others can say about ALL crypto.... "see we told you this was all a scam."
3771 2018-01-07 23:25:36 Do you think its still a good buy when it hits the exchange?

3859 2018-01-07 23:19:23 I've been asking anyone I could find with some experience in crypto, most people seem to think CoinsMarkets will be back up by Friday and that our coins are safe.
3860 2018-01-07 23:19:17 Another fair point. How much in total has been lost, one wonders?

Perhaps someday, in the distant future, some digital equivalent of a retiree with a metal detector will make a hobby of finding and cracking into lost crypto accounts, like hoards of old Roman coins. 
3861 2018-01-07 23:19:17 @HDFCBank_Cares @HDFC_Bank you should be ashamed of yourselves for mistreating your (current) account holders just because they love crypto currencies.

3877 2018-01-07 23:18:17 I think people should approach crypto with the mindset of a VC. Evaluate each investment opportunity for its long-term potential.  I’m only invested in a handful of coins/tokens.
3878 2018-01-07 23:18:07 The funny part is that I am actually resigning my job this month thanks to crypto. Looking forward to it!

3881 2018-01-07 23:17:54 #Bitcoin dominance is at ATL and currently only 33%. Two ideas:

1. Bitcoin is gonna run up soon for another cycle
2. We're in the next step of S curve, getting into real adoption slowly and we'll never see Bitcoin accumulating 80% of #crypto capital again
3882 2018-01-07 23:17:45 HELLO #GIFTO to the crypto family!

3899 2018-01-07 23:15:47 Have you been on crypto for long? 2018 as a whole is an aeon on top on an eternity in crypto time. Maybe the underdog for the first weeks of 2018. Then who know who will come and crash the party.
3900 2018-01-07 23:15:45 Bubble will burst but there is much more money to come into it.

3910 2018-01-07 23:15:16 If you’re unsure on whether a crypto currency is a dodgy pyramid scheme, just check how breathlessly excited the people trying to get you to buy it are, and how rich they claim everyone’ll get.
3911 2018-01-07 23:15:14 Holy crypto balls.

3916 2018-01-07 23:14:58 I doubt about #xrp but right #ethereum #bitcoincash and #bitcoinhush have a great future
3917 2018-01-07 23:14:55 I'm just ready for all this crypto hype to settle down.
So many billions of stupid money being put to coins with no tech and no future. once they fizzle out, the actually coins with use like Ethereum will gain billions in market cap and go much much higher!

3920 2018-01-07 23:14:32 Agreed at least not the big one that you can keep open for months.
Wouldn't surprise me if XRP made another all time high or at least a double top soon.

Yeah agreed I've been taking money out every month to safeguard against that possibility.
Bubble pop makes leaving impossible
3921 2018-01-07 23:14:29 These inflated crypto prices is related to the lack of liquidity. $10 million buy pressure in any of these alts will make it skyrocket. Now imagine the billions that want to get in right now.
3922 2018-01-07 23:14:20 The site is slowly getting better. At around 6pm est I was able to logout, log back in, and check my balances which were STILL THERE! Not much more capabilities than that for now tho

I think it may be creating incorrect hype as maybe there is no plan, just a fan with a successful man? Do you know what i am saying? I am invested in TRON fyi.
3939 2018-01-07 23:13:01 It's a terrible decision though. And stands out from other fair use decisions that are much more charitable to First Amendment interests. Then again, not sure Trump quite has a fair use argument here...

4001 2018-01-07 23:08:17 Crypto, THAT coin has NO utility. Honestly, if anyone of my friends said they were thinking of investing in it I would strongly advise them not to. There are loads of others which they could invest in which will give real growth. AND peace of mind. It will dump. #pac
4002 2018-01-07 23:08:16 Discussion: #Verge, $XVG

At approximately £0.135/$0.184, $XVG was sitting at £0.10 1 week ago, with a price spike in the the hype for Crypto and BTC hitting £0.17. Overall up 26% in the past week with long term but stable growth.

Where do we think that Verge is going?

4017 2018-01-07 23:07:05 My #crypto strategy:

1. #hodl through the dips with iron hands.
2. Forget reading charts and TA. It's a waste.
3. If you beat $BTC's growth, you've won.
4. Respect $BTC and leave it at least 30% of your portfolio.
5. Never sell all of one coin. Always leave a little for upside.
4018 2018-01-07 23:06:55 Unless you got proof please stop.

4027 2018-01-07 23:05:59 Are u still an $XBY believer? The news today was a bit wish washy compared to there usually brilliance. Hoping for a pump with the test net news and then will move to some more Crypotopia bags #crypto

4033 2018-01-07 23:05:38 I love that @LouisePentland is the type of vlogger that can talk babies, life, stress, skincare and crypto currency! So refreshing.
4034 2018-01-07 23:05:27 Nice article. I say ‘yes, it can be seen as such along with the entire milieu of dysfunctional mutual exploitation crypto has been plopped into.’ It’s spot on in this way.

4037 2018-01-07 23:05:19 I bought 10,000 #doge as an #crypto experiment. If I keep them for 1 year, I will probably get...
4038 2018-01-07 23:05:18 Man, unfollowing crypto accounts based on them being Alt-right racist weirdos is really taking me down a peg. Can anyone recommend some accounts with good predictions that stick to making money and not politics? #BTC #LTC #ETH #XRP #TRX #crypto #cryptocurrency #
4039 2018-01-07 23:05:07 You really think they'd be crazy enough not to support this fork? I'd be shocked if they didn't. They supported bitcoin cash right away when others didn't.
4040 2018-01-07 23:05:07 amazing! when did you start
4041 2018-01-07 23:05:05 Yup, keep looking, reading and learning. I always tell people to be happy for others so good things will come for you also.

4052 2018-01-07 23:04:10 But if you are set on them holding crypto, set up an endowment in crypto, with x% cash out in fiat/crypto to be used for spending... The problem would be the volatility of value for spending

4063 2018-01-07 23:03:13 #Crypto as an assett class is likely in a bubble -- many projects at insane valuations with little more than a Whitepaper. But who's to say how much it's all worth until actual implementation on every smart phone in the world? Wait and see I guess
4064 2018-01-07 23:03:09 So now converting crypto to, you know, an actually currency that can be used to buy goods/services for the charity is "burning it"?
4065 2018-01-07 23:03:07 perhaps

4067 2018-01-07 23:03:05 Gonna buy more if it dips much 
4068 2018-01-07 23:02:58 How could crypto as a whole be undervalued if 98% are dramatically overvalued?
4069 2018-01-07 23:02:54 For those of you using the equation of exchange for purposes of crypto tokens, remember a) it is an identity only, and b) to ruthlessly adhere to what your high school physics teachers told you about showing all your units.
4070 2018-01-07 23:02:52 Have been waiting for this
4071 2018-01-07 23:02:34 Praying for the day crypto completely falls apart and all the Crypto For Blokes go bankrupt and I can buy their family homes for cheap

4073 2018-01-07 23:02:27 Unless I’m misunderstanding something the ETH amount you put of 0.00164 is only $1.15. Should it be 0.01164 ETH?83,000 Satoshi is $13.63.

4076 2018-01-07 23:02:13 I guess people need money for something other than investing. Ot would be great if they had enough to spare and invest in crypto...but then they wouldn't need donations.
4077 2018-01-07 23:02:10 #drp almost $2 on #coinmarketcap and no one even knows about it yet.  Going to be big this year once they release their #vcplatform and #derivitivesexchange #drp #drpu #drps
4078 2018-01-07 23:02:10 Wrestlers and baseball players are perfect for crypto. Wrestlers can effectively economize resources, and baseball players can analyze data like crazy
4079 2018-01-07 23:02:08 @bulldogholme -W/out history this is a tough question to answer,but what correlation exists between the proliferation of the number of #AltCoins (1,350 PLUS) ,trading activity&value and the need for a simialr trajectory for crypto mining capacity? Who is tracking mining capacity?
4080 2018-01-07 23:02:01 Imagine being paid 10 Bitcoin for a house. Worth $160000. An hour later u now have 150000. Big difference in money. What would stop this in the future? People pump and dumping popular crypto for financial gain can hurt others.
4081 2018-01-07 23:01:39 @crypto_pies: #TRX #TRON +9,32% day to day and +13.44% per hour.  I informed you yesterday you should jump in.

4085 2018-01-07 23:01:28 I’m thinking the longer binance, bittrex, cryptopia are closed to new registrations the better for $KCS

4089 2018-01-07 23:00:58 Las CRYPTO nos dan enormes oportunidades operativas y de analisis... Por la rapidez de los movimientos, nos obligan a hacer nuestro mejor esfuerzo... ojala y todos aprovechen la oportunidad que brinda.

4092 2018-01-07 23:00:47 @hitbtc - Not allowing users to withdrawal #btc. After 6 days of stall tactics and an unresponsive support team, I've read hundreds of other complaints. Maybe time to file reports to applicable law enforcement agencies like the @IRS, @FBI, @FTC, @SEC,   #Interpol among others

4098 2018-01-07 23:00:17 Greece’s economy is 20% crypto. I dont believe commies should be included in surveys accessing independent central banks of the free world
4099 2018-01-07 23:00:16 Best charity happens around my world as people are poor around here in India. i just walk through streets at times, take poor kids along and we enjoy burgers together. not a big deal but makes me n them happy

4101 2018-01-07 23:00:15 Hmmmm i remember something about a fool and his money....how does that end????
4102 2018-01-07 23:00:14 I don't understand the need for a decentralized currency. 
For storing value I absolutely want it to be censorship resistant and have distributed consenses. 
But a currency is a tool to transfer value, I want it to be fast, cheap, dont care who owns it. Different designs

4112 2018-01-07 22:59:17 Crypto security reminders:

1. Never share your private key.
2. Don't hold tokens on exchanges.
3. Use 2-factor authentication.
4. Don't publicize your holdings.
5. You can never be too cautious.
4113 2018-01-07 22:59:08 Michael please do enjin coin. I'm sure you already know but the gaming industry is perfect for crypto! Can't wait until we see more of this. Also their wallet is about to come out and I hear is very good.
4114 2018-01-07 22:59:08 cryptopia/nz ,   its basic but has everything you need to trade
4115 2018-01-07 22:59:06 People not understanding how it works so they do what they're doing now and throw $ at low coins. Using the system as financial gain instead of actually supporting a good crypto and trying to make change. Then all the coins flucuate too much and become too unstable for $ use.
4116 2018-01-07 22:58:58 Pro tip: research your coins. Know the long term plan, know the community, know the technology, know about the active projects. The market will catch up with your decisions one way or the other. #crypto
4117 2018-01-07 22:58:48 Same here. Did they fix it ?

Sitting at his pc he’s a real bit hit
He go so excited, he needed a shit!!

4146 2018-01-07 22:56:57 Never store your #cryptocurrency in one place, use mulitple Exchanges #Binance #BittrexExchange #kuckian #BITHUMB etc!! Use multiple devices for Wallets  Laptops, PC, phones, Use multiple hardware wallets never store your whole portfolio in one place. Spread the Risk
4147 2018-01-07 22:56:57 
4148 2018-01-07 22:56:50 True.

But bear in mind big movements on the crypto markets are fueled by inside trading and market manipulation. And we are out of that.

4150 2018-01-07 22:56:33 Huge week coming for $XRP and $TRX , i see #Ripple blowing past $4 possibly touching $5, while #Tron blows past .27 cents and possibly breaches .40 cents. #Crypto #bitcoin
4151 2018-01-07 22:56:32 No that would still be in U.S. Dollars... you need to pay attention in your finance/economic classes dawg... I'm not talking about "not trusting money in U.S. bank"... I keep my money stored in other places like #Oil $CL_F, #Gold $GC_F, #Stocks, other countries #FX, even #Crypto.
4152 2018-01-07 22:56:30 But #XRP is the system...

4167 2018-01-07 22:55:41 Since crypto is an extremely bull market right now it's a lot easier to make profits than it is when trading stocks.

4169 2018-01-07 22:55:34 I feel like he may have misunderstood my intentions, in no way way was I trying to “troll” him. I was simply recording him. Either way I don’t think he should’ve reacted the way he did.
4170 2018-01-07 22:55:25 U must be kidding lol
4171 2018-01-07 22:55:16 ZCL has little/no value outside of fork, so theres that. with that said, i am mining it ATM for the drop. nothing wrong with playing both sides of this... all u guys stalking chats of coins you hate lmao.  quit taking this tech/money so personally and just think.
4172 2018-01-07 22:55:14 #nagacoin releasing MasterCard which converts to euros however it's not published on #coinmarketcap currently but been tweeted by the founder ...maybe a good opportunity... especially after the visa crypto issue last week ..@Altcoinbuzz

4180 2018-01-07 22:54:29 lets hope so
4181 2018-01-07 22:54:28 As great as crypto might seem sometimes. There are risks involved when you're investing into it and you are capable of losing money.

4184 2018-01-07 22:54:21 I realize #crypto takes control away from govt but I feel the exchanges have replaced the govt role.

4241 2018-01-07 22:50:33 Bohm-Bawerk, key figure in Austrian economics (and hence both marginalism and libertarianism) misunderstood capitalism and Marx bc he thought money was an inessential veil.  Crypto-currencies are - in a relishable irony - an attempt to actually make this fantasy true.

4318 2018-01-07 22:44:42 Don't be a dumb ass ! Keep hold of your ripple . EVERY crypto or stock has some sort of correction. More people that holds the less the price will fall. Plane and simple we are doing good .

4328 2018-01-07 22:44:10 Things to think about: You can never lose more than 100% of your invested money, you can, however, make much more than 100% profit

4329 2018-01-07 22:44:06 98% referred to cash + exchange listed crypto assets with decent liquidity.
4330 2018-01-07 22:44:04 Current state of crypto:

Wanted to buy Titcoin $TIT, accidentally bought Tittiecoin $TTC. Up 300%...
4331 2018-01-07 22:43:48 On that basis would you transfer profit of other coins into it, irrelevant of the current price of $BTC or would you wait for dips and hold elsewhere i.e. $USDT?

4337 2018-01-07 22:43:25 One step in the right direction would be to create a decentralized "gofundme" type of service that would accept crypto and run using Ethereum smart contracts. Once established, local retailers could be brought on board to accept crypto payments.

4349 2018-01-07 22:41:29 Now now,  qsp will have the greatest growth this year,  easily five fold.  Especially with so many announcements coming. Every crypto will be audited using qsp. It's a very unique project, and it's tokens will be in demand.

4369 2018-01-07 22:39:24 Natürlich OpenSource (MIT), mit bewerter Crypto und die Möglichkeit voll dezentral zu arbeiten. Es wir keinen einigen call zu festen Servern geben. Mal schauen... Vielleicht habe ich im Sommer Zeit und Lust das nochmal zu starten. Via Crowdfunding und so :P

4375 2018-01-07 22:38:47 I love people's reaction to me buying and trading crypto currencies to make money. "How are they even worth anything?" Oh I'm sorry Susan I forgot, you go every week to remove gold from your local bank branch to put in your home vault. Right? Sit down Susan. Sit. Down.
4376 2018-01-07 22:38:39 Where do I go for help? Need someone to point me in the right direction. I'm locked out of the account and worried that all my funds weren't appearing correctly. Is this a glitch? #Binance #Help #Desperate #Crypto #CustomerService
4377 2018-01-07 22:38:35 People who buy Ripple at the expense of decentralization are like people who vote for a candidate based on benefits they could receive at the expense of liberty.  DUMP Ripple!
4378 2018-01-07 22:38:29 The homeless population could greatly benefit from crypto. It would allow for a means to receive donations and to store assets (most don't have access to banks). The biggest issue in preventing this is the lack of local retailers who could provide goods in exchange for crypto.

4411 2018-01-07 22:35:34 the best crypto!
4412 2018-01-07 22:35:30 My point is that the best way to "vote" for one crypto over another is to mine the one you don't want to win, and buy the one you want to win with the proceeds.

Bonus points for mining crypto with the same hash algo as the one you like, especially if one or both has a fast DAA.
4413 2018-01-07 22:35:29 one of the more fun aspects of the "crypto bubble" is it combines parts of the internet bubble with wolf of wall street penny-stock-type scams...

4444 2018-01-07 22:32:24 what do you care if they chose to pay taxes or not its none of your business. If you want to pay your taxes than do so if you dont want to pay your taxes than don't. I really don't see the point of doxing people who don't want to pay thier taxes.

4532 2018-01-07 22:25:45 Some reasons why crypto currencies are here to stay: it’s 2018 and some places still have a minimum charge to use a credit card, you still have to sign a receipt — which is meaningless for security and you can’t do micro transactions (less than a cent)

4540 2018-01-07 22:25:14 Do yo have a theory on why coins like $ark, $kmd, $strat have such a hard time breaking out of their current prices while coins like $drgn are taking off like a rocket? Is it because their growth phase is done for now?
4541 2018-01-07 22:25:10 Where do we track performance and find out about new crypto currencies to be launched?

4556 2018-01-07 22:23:24 Didn't you see it break out from 230 to 2047 sats these last days? I mean a correction is normal, if you can't handle the ups and downs you shouldn't invest in #crypto it will drive you crazy  Charts gives us an indicator of what can happen, but not neccesserly what will happen

4576 2018-01-07 22:22:03 2/ Crypto might be the first global market in history, where a vast majority of the participants lack any basic knowledge of the assets they are working with. Hence, it’s virtually impossible for the average “investor” to judge the merit of the projects they are investing in.

4613 2018-01-07 22:18:58 I would be careful at these prices. It has already pumped astronomically. Try to find a dip if you are really interested but be safe. This is in dangerous territory.
4614 2018-01-07 22:18:57 Wondering why folks in the crypto community haven’t realized that investing in Ripple could put valuable decentralized BTC/ETC and other coins in the hands of the banks. Don’t be fooled, this is the banking industry’s best bet at controlling the crypto market. #DumpXRP

4622 2018-01-07 22:18:23 Why do you use a fake profile picture?

4627 2018-01-07 22:17:37 TBF (appreciate now its obvs my own lack of #DYOR) I had always assumed XRP = Ripple "the (crypto)currency", I didn't appreciate the distinction that Ripple was the company and XRP was something else. I thought XRP was just the ticker. Is that it's actual name?
4628 2018-01-07 22:17:22 How do you make money in crypto? You must be smart, or be early. 80% of my money is earned from being early.

4648 2018-01-07 22:16:09 No, its chill @hitbtc; I didn't really want to withdraw anyway. Please continue to take as many days as you need. It's not like #crypto is an incredibly volatile market where timing matters or anything.
4649 2018-01-07 22:15:59 @JulienCryptoXx  Question, vous avez déjà encaissé vos bénefs de crypto ? Le prix qu'on voit sur coingecko ou autres c'est pas le prix de rachat sur des plateformes genre bittrex. Ex. XRP 2.30€ bittrex à la vente qud affiché 2.80€ sur coingecko. Trompeur? Vous confirmez?

4665 2018-01-07 22:14:29 SO true, i know 2 types of crypto investors. 1) People who jump on the climb and get in late and sell low. 2) people who research a crypto, they may get in middle of the road but that HODL pays off.

4677 2018-01-07 22:13:27 Its survivorship bias, people are only familiar with the 1 successful business or singer or actor etc. It is apparent in all walks of life and I agree crypto will have a massive graveyard by the end.

4704 2018-01-07 22:11:25 I think what he meant was that if people think the price of crypto is going to go up, they’re incentivized to wait. Like that they can give more. Unless charities hodl.

4758 2018-01-07 22:07:06 I have a question ... what happens if bitcoin dips to $300 will it be the end of Crypto?? @CryptoHedge_
4759 2018-01-07 22:07:03 Are you a fan of this project?

4761 2018-01-07 22:06:52 But then how come on coinexchange, it says the price is 2 cent?
4762 2018-01-07 22:06:39 Crypto in a bull market. Dow Jones closed at all time high.... When the crash comes, the dot com bubble and 2008 might seem like a little dent. The amount of credit out there is scary. #bitcoin
4763 2018-01-07 22:06:32 Crypto-investment fund $TAAS seems to have found a bottom. Next quarterly dividend is due around end of February, so there is every reason to assume it will rise from here. Annualized dividend payments are probably around 30%. You must register your coins for dividends @ taas
4764 2018-01-07 22:06:32 This is so true, this is why I still have my full time job and a business I run with my dad.  Crypto is pure risk, and i look at to bring in some extra money to supplement my income not to replace it.  The hope is that the research, reading, getting 3 hours a day sleep pays off!
4765 2018-01-07 22:06:29 I see through your lies Mr. "Crypto Mastermind"

4767 2018-01-07 22:06:22 Crypto currency is an actual term and I hate it
4768 2018-01-07 22:06:19 As per @CoinMarketCap the crypto world currently has about $820bn within it.

A lot of it is experiments, scams, doomed projects and straight up Ponzi schemes.

Regardless, this sector is about to experience multi trillion dollar capital inflows.

4780 2018-01-07 22:05:52 You killed it dude
4781 2018-01-07 22:05:39 Really just depends on how much you have to start with and how much you need to take out IMO
4782 2018-01-07 22:05:36 Crypto is not just a currency, its a lifestyle. Its all about decentralization and finding value in what you believe. So go forward, buy what you want, invest with who you wish. At this point, you can't really lose.

4789 2018-01-07 22:04:56 Crypto infrastructure + applications = virtuous cycle. 

1) Adoption fuels demand for better infrastructure
2) Better infrastructure fuels better service & leads to adoption 
3) Funding poring into all projects has network effect that increases the value of all crypto projects

4820 2018-01-07 22:02:19 Hey @DiaryofaMadeMan! I follow you and your work all the time, Thank You for making crypto investing exciting and an easy learning experience! Just wanted to give you a heads up that you ICO report has been lagging for the past couple days. Refreshed, restarted and still loading!
4821 2018-01-07 22:02:18 You can reset the seed when it arrives and that ensures reliability (so I am told). Ledger has them listed as a trusted reseller and they have a following on FB, etc. Think that’s the best you can do since the Nano is on backorder until March.
4822 2018-01-07 22:02:15 j'ai investi dans la crypto monnaie je vous tiens au courant
4823 2018-01-07 22:02:12 Which is why they wont last.

4828 2018-01-07 22:01:54 Cryptocurrencies is just an application of the wider field of distributed systems, security, economics, game-theory and cryptography. If you want respect from the security/crypto field - there are some "big no nos". Back doors is one of them.
4829 2018-01-07 22:01:47 The marketcap of @Ripple is +/- $360 Billion. 

Here is the following market caps of other companies:

@Uber - $48 billion
@airbnb - $31 billion
@Tesla - $53 billion
@McDonalds - $137 billion 

This is why @Ripple's marketcap is waaaaay overvalued!

4839 2018-01-07 22:00:31 I truly hope everyone I know and care about w significant crypto investments executes on this logic. You’ll never be devastated for leaving a little on the table, but you will be if you end up with nothing
4840 2018-01-07 22:00:21 I think the mistake I make is  I buy right away  and don't read his Graph, usually there still going down and he's giving us the signal. We to study the graph and start learning more on signal specially buying and selling. He's accurate everytime just have to be patient.

4849 2018-01-07 21:59:54 Everyone investing in crypto ...All these blue or pink baby announcement glitter bomb things are all over my social media every freaking day.. how do I invest into the company that makes pink/ blue glitter .. people are gonna keep making babies , that’s where the money is 
4850 2018-01-07 21:59:54 My thought on crypto: it is about individual freedom and the chance to decide how to manage, share, keep my "energy" without any political/ignorant or greedy bankster in between having a say. So, all others who jump on the train just for the profit still need to learn a bag ;-)
4851 2018-01-07 21:59:50 Post videos of Justin's previous interviews that he has done cause a lot of people still haven't seen them and a lot dont even know how good he is at what he does. Post videos of crypto bloggers mentioning Verge, there's lot on YouTube, the more well known they are the better
4852 2018-01-07 21:59:50 >> global stability is generally a contra indicator for the price of crypto. Though it would depend on the nature of the war. If the war specifically sought the destruction of the internet, this would discourage the movement towards crypto and towards other commodities.

4856 2018-01-07 21:59:40 Regulation isn’t all bad, but it’s increasing harder to do in the crypto environment!! I think crypto should have some consumer protections, but if people want to be part of a Ponzi what can you do?
4857 2018-01-07 21:59:34 Inquiétant de voir tant d'arnaques avec la Crypto monnaie 
Quand ça va éclater ça va faire mal à toute la Blockchain et c'est bien triste

4860 2018-01-07 21:59:12 Not about googling. It's about knowing your assets including your spouses crypto currency information. It works both ways.  But I coach many women that have no idea what their total assets are or info. This is reality. It's obviously not all women by any means but some.

4865 2018-01-07 21:58:25 Appreciate it man!
4866 2018-01-07 21:58:18 English translation: Japan has the potential to be at the forefront of crypto. All that’s left is whether they can show flexibility legally and in taxation. The most important thing is that all the world’s projects and public chains can become understood and used.
4867 2018-01-07 21:58:17 Borrow is expensive (expected vol) and risk/return profile asymmetrical in crypto. Not to mention collateral and margin requirements if done right. Naked shorting best left to professional traders or for those not afraid to have their face ripped off.
4868 2018-01-07 21:58:17 There is always  a pump 2 minute before your news...
Where do you publish this news before Twitter?
Thanks
4869 2018-01-07 21:58:17 what people need to understand is that $XVG has 16.5 billion max supply.
so if
verge = 1$ it will be a top #5 crypto
verge = 10$ it will be right behind bitcoin
verge = 20$ it will surpass bitcoin

as much as i would like to see this as a verge longterm hodler, it wont happen :-)

4888 2018-01-07 21:57:11 I think a "Sell coins" could be an option. Example, I sold 59 XRP at $2.31 and invested all that into TRX at $0.07. Maybe in that "Sell coin" option it should ask: Did you cash out or invest in another crypto? How much did you cash out? And stuff like that. That's just my idea :)

Hi John, Keep up the great work and recommendations. Check out Dinastycoin DCY, privacy coin, super  low market cap, that is really cheap.

4896 2018-01-07 21:56:59 Lend, mana, & cnd. Relatively new & still learning. I don’t have much money in crypto but I can’t wait to learn more and see some growth.
4897 2018-01-07 21:56:56 Right on man. And with 2017 being a CRAZY crypto year, what will 2018 then be called 
4898 2018-01-07 21:56:45 You know when you're on cryptotwitter way too much when someone says "to the room" and you hear "to the moon"
#crypto #bitcoin #moon #xrp #ada #altcoin #cryptocurrency
4899 2018-01-07 21:56:43 Sounds great. I'll have a look at @tokenaicrypto!   Got any projects you're particularly excited about in crypto? Other than the aforementioned of course!
4900 2018-01-07 21:56:42 Why should this person represent anyone else? And yes, I hold crypto.
4901 2018-01-07 21:56:39 I did the exact same thing! Enjoy the ride :-)
4902 2018-01-07 21:56:39 Should be in about 2 hours i believe.. Jan 8 in Korea
4903 2018-01-07 21:56:32 If you’re not taking advantage of what’s going on in crypto currencies you could be missing the biggest train of all time.  
4904 2018-01-07 21:56:22 I have hung in the shadows for a few years in the crypto world... learning, investing, and reading. Continuing to learn, but now jumping in more actively and help educate where I can. Ripple has a great, practical strategy to be the bridge to a new era on asset/value exchange.
4905 2018-01-07 21:56:15 What if there was a way to buy in to the utility of automation? Is there a crypto token model that would allow a worker to have a monetary gain, as #Robotics and #AI gain more traction? Not shares, which bank on management's ability, but instead a utility token. #blockchain
4906 2018-01-07 21:56:09 Crypto security reminders:

1. Never share your private key.
2. Don't hold tokens on exchanges.
3. Use 2-factor authentication.
4. Don't publicize your holdings.
5. You can never be too cautious.

4912 2018-01-07 21:55:54 How is ripple even considered a crypto
4913 2018-01-07 21:55:53 Neither is BTCP? LOL whats your point xD
4914 2018-01-07 21:55:45 Am I the only one struggling to justify investing in crypto at these levels? Due a correction at some point..... $btl $eth $ltc

4918 2018-01-07 21:55:01 What’s Crypto?

4924 2018-01-07 21:54:35 I challenge you to find even one historical example where MV = PQ worked to describe an actual currency. You can’t. Actual prices cannot be determined by solving for P in relation to completely disconnected aggregates. This is like using crypto currency marketcaps for valuations
4925 2018-01-07 21:54:31 @Altcoinbuzzio , I just saw your IG post about looking to build your team. I am a psychologist and crypto enthusiast. I may be able to offer your team a unique perspective with my training in human behavior, research, and medicine. Contact me if interested in talking further.
4926 2018-01-07 21:54:23 Do you have a trusted IP to use with the Binance api?
4927 2018-01-07 21:54:17 Do you know when Storm is entering Bittrex?
4928 2018-01-07 21:54:00 Awesome having you on! Thanks again :)
4929 2018-01-07 21:53:51 It's funny that cryptofans say the tokens crypto bubble is necessary for future invest in tech infrastructure but at the same time complain of a USD bubble that basically makes possible all future investment. Lol
4930 2018-01-07 21:53:50 Surprised #bleutrade doesn’t get more attention with some of the big exchanges like #binance closing their books. It’s reasonably good imo #crypto #altcoins #cryptocurrency #bitcoin

4938 2018-01-07 21:53:21 Anecdotal story: my company switched to Kaspersky in 2013. Within 6 months we were hit with a crypto lock virus. Our IT dept said the only we could be assured of recovering our data was by paying. We did. Then switched software again, and we never had that issue again.

4940 2018-01-07 21:53:14 As i tweeted few days back, Why #LEND is a good buy? It's a simple platform that allows you to lend your #eth to others while you gain interest on the loan. Compared to #salt also a good project but listed at more than $12 per coin, #lend may be $6 less in than a year! #crypto

4959 2018-01-07 21:52:00 Huge opportunity, as you said. I see the crypto lending companies like SALT and LEND tapping into this space. Plus, I’m sure @gofundme me is at least entertaining the idea.

4961 2018-01-07 21:51:56 The Archangel episode of Black Mirror with the kid monitor thing reminded me of me checking up on my crypto. My phone alerts me when my cryptos are in trouble.

4966 2018-01-07 21:51:36 Hi Rob. That's not entirely true. We do not automatically block payments to exchanges that deal with Crypto Currency. We won't be opening new accounts for the sole purpose of trading Crypto Currency. ^IM
4967 2018-01-07 21:51:33 My greater point is, if his wall is full of only cryptos that are about to "moon", and no cryptos that are going to under perform, than it would seem he loses some credibility? Not being a hater, just think it makes more sense to list the bad with the good.

4971 2018-01-07 21:51:16 You're being very conservative with a 25X :) Ofcourse, depends if the market is bullish or not but 10-20x will be a 1 month target ..
4972 2018-01-07 21:51:12 Exactly. If we want a sustainable eco system, minable coins are the last thing we need. 
This hard work: state sponsored waste of energy helping only the big miners getting rich. Miners who don't provide jobs, won't help starting businesses, and don't care about crypto ideology.

4974 2018-01-07 21:51:09 and I did not anticipate to make money with buying crypto was only a hobby
4975 2018-01-07 21:51:02 I don't want to discourage you, but the total crypto market cap simply went up. Compare the relative change to other subs like r/ethereum+r/ethtrader and other crypto projects. Not to mention that ETC is profiting from Ethereum's success and name recognition/confusion.
4976 2018-01-07 21:50:57 The chinise dude
4977 2018-01-07 21:50:56 Didn't you hate crypto last year?
4978 2018-01-07 21:50:56 If ETH could do $8 to $1000 in a year. I’m sure ICX will be able to beat that as long as they stay on track. The crypto exposure is far greater and what they are offering is far superior
4979 2018-01-07 21:50:46 two times the fun for thoose who missed the first ride.
4980 2018-01-07 21:50:39 Think there will be a lot of arbitraging, but dunno what will happen to the price. Sometimes have a feeling bittrex does it accidently
4981 2018-01-07 21:50:36 It will be okay. Good long term coin
4982 2018-01-07 21:50:34 Hejen?

4985 2018-01-07 21:50:31 Feb, Korean exchange not confirmed yet
4986 2018-01-07 21:50:27 Now what happens when you withdrawal or track it. Are they tracking it by $BTC or are they converting it at the time you put it in? My issue with this is if $BTC is worth $15,000 yesterday (you buy). And you put it in crypto pro tomorrow at $17,000 - What is the accurate way?
4987 2018-01-07 21:50:26 You should try diversifying a little less if you only have that much. I would say instead maybe trade until you have around $250 and get a slightly diverse portfolio. Wait for gains sell some diversift more. Just my advice, take it or leave it  but good job either way!
4988 2018-01-07 21:50:24 Insane amount of arbitrage opportunities in crypto exchanges
4989 2018-01-07 21:50:23 Switching to a new phone with Google Authenticator and crypto apps requires a PhD. The industry's UX still blows.

5026 2018-01-07 21:47:36 DOGE and DRGN being 1B each is not a joke - gaming and casual monetary usage (e.g. tipping, bartering for collectibles, betting) are big categories, many billions in revenue, but high velocity.

5035 2018-01-07 21:47:08 It's starting to get to me as well. I understand the BitcoinMaximist but greed has brought a new breed of crypto Maximist. There shouldn't be a RippleMaximist or EtherMaximist in my opinion. People don't understand the different use cases, all they're interested in is USD return.
5036 2018-01-07 21:47:08 Why would this show $SALT will pump? Sorry mate only just reading how to study graphs 
5037 2018-01-07 21:47:08 I know the prices from his group - only 1 BTC for 10 min.
5038 2018-01-07 21:47:06 Lol ripple is not even a crypto currency
5039 2018-01-07 21:47:05 $UKG
5040 2018-01-07 21:47:00 Ok... so I could sell an account for 1btc :D
5041 2018-01-07 21:46:55 Shilling 2.0 from a gold bug that doesn't like crypto? And I thought that Dogecoin thing was pretty bizarre. Forget about this crap I'm going long AF on titcoin, 0.99% sure it makes the cut on this list
5042 2018-01-07 21:46:44 Really nice stats man!! I have just entered the crypto world
and im happy to be a follower.
Keep up the good work.

Cheers from Sweden.

5046 2018-01-07 21:46:24 I can't seem to find more information regarding those ICO's on the www
5047 2018-01-07 21:46:21 check out his last post abouy xvg..?
5048 2018-01-07 21:46:19 Watched a fun flick down here in Oz called Happy Hunting. It’s about how crazy it is in ‘Merica right now. On Netflix streams. Starting Mark Dingle, poor guy goes through it.
5049 2018-01-07 21:46:19 Hey @eToro, why on earth do you have a $1000 minimum deposit level?! That's ridiculously high for on-the-side #crypto trading, WTF!?!
5050 2018-01-07 21:46:17 also not true about BAT.

5052 2018-01-07 21:46:00 "The Astonishing" ends with the words:

"We sing a song of freedom
Together we are bound
People, we shall never hold you down
We will build our world on common ground."

Does that sound like the work of a crypto-fascist to you?
5053 2018-01-07 21:45:56 Once you're balls deep like they are... there's no pulling out.
5054 2018-01-07 21:45:49 Du coup, tu as choisi quel crypto?
5055 2018-01-07 21:45:43 My very small crypto investment has turned out pretty well.
5056 2018-01-07 21:45:36 That's why we need decentralized exchanges, if you want some crypto, I'll sell you some. I only accept interac e-transfers though.
5057 2018-01-07 21:45:35 Understand man, it sucks that happened, it shouldn't of. Going forward , the only thing u can be is more cognizant that people are unpredictable. Maybe next time, just ask for a photo. Either way, I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope you're okay!
5058 2018-01-07 21:45:34 Funny, $XVG @xvgwhale gone quiet - pulled in by the SEC for a talking to with mcafee ? $crypto

5064 2018-01-07 21:45:25 Which crypto should I invest in now? I'll make a study about the most mentioned and put it in a new video on my YouTube. #Bitcoin #Crypto #BTC #XEM #LTC #BCH #XRP #ADA #BCG #MIOTA #IOTA #ETH #XLM #TRX #DASH

5066 2018-01-07 21:45:22 @Haejin_Crypto Can you tell us what you think of $SNOV?
5067 2018-01-07 21:45:21 i am taking tomorrow
5068 2018-01-07 21:45:19 All true and the word $HVN is spreading out. It's my pleasure to recommend the HVN platform to all the small and medium biz owners and crypto investors because I plan to use HVN myself for the agro trading business selling and buying invoices. Viva la factoring! @hiveproject_net
5069 2018-01-07 21:45:19 $MINT
5070 2018-01-07 21:45:18 There should be way more non-profit Crypto Coins.

5075 2018-01-07 21:44:58 There is absolutely no way I am taking any advice from you when it comes to Crypto!
5076 2018-01-07 21:44:52 maybe you 2 do live stream together
5077 2018-01-07 21:44:48 Some felt that this was proof that Petrucci was some kind of crypto-fascist. I didn't agree with him either, but I think to pigeonhole Petrucci based on those comments is a mistake.
5078 2018-01-07 21:44:47 Why do people constantly feel it necessary to compare $XVG and $TRX???  They are used for 2 totally different things.  You can't compare the two.  And why not hold both?  The immaturity in the crypto community is comical.
5079 2018-01-07 21:44:36 Are you going live with $trx ?

5090 2018-01-07 21:43:57 Great job! You really gave the crypto community a good summary of #Decred project. I hope you get into the rocket  with us! Because it’s going to the moon!
5091 2018-01-07 21:43:56 Ive been saying that we are exiting the technology time and have entered the psychological time of crypto. Its consumerism and marketing now

5103 2018-01-07 21:42:56 Why I always suggest to people to keep a percentage of $BTC for blood days: (just a few example of coins I've bought 2 days ago during blood)

$CPC +16%
$GUP +24%
$UKG +133%
$SPHR = STABLE
$DTB +20%
$MAID +18%
$NBT +8%
 
It's a really simple tips but effective!
5104 2018-01-07 21:42:51 Long overdue!! But I’m in for the long haul man. A lot of cheap alt action combined with btc movement & upcoming forks have kept people preoccupied. Next week will be a BIG week for $eng!!

5111 2018-01-07 21:42:19 Just to play devils advocate, do they know that $200k is in someone's personal account or is that speculation? It could perhaps be in a gofundme account or some such? Based on that info alone seems to be jumping the gun somewhat.., but not necessarily wrong either IMHO

5115 2018-01-07 21:41:53 TRON is a short term play for me; the pumps will fund long term investments. Recent accusations don't fill me with confidence, but they aren't slam dunk so am hanging on. I have set floor limit for exit anyway, the losses of which will be more than covered by gains elsewhere.
5116 2018-01-07 21:41:47 It would be easy enough for a charity to set up a wallet address to donate to. The problem is that everyone I try to talk to about Crypto still think that it is fake internet money and are clueless to it's power.
5117 2018-01-07 21:41:44 Lee a bad name by going on twitter and tweeting opinionated and rude things about why everyone else is stupid and he's some all knowing crypto god.  My points were just that he was wrong in saying that Litecoin is the only crypto currency that vendors will accept
5118 2018-01-07 21:41:37 We don't see the tremendous risks some are taking for these profits so when we see 10x trades posted we naturally get jealous. No one wants to do the work though.

5124 2018-01-07 21:41:22 Just got off my plane. There were 11 full page $crypto related advertisements in there, and mentions of the blockchain in 2 articles.
5125 2018-01-07 21:41:19 That was really racist of you. Remember - you can’t spell Nazi without Socialist. I don’t believe in progressiveness, eugenics, selective sterilization etc. I leave that to the progressive movement and their crypto racists.

5131 2018-01-07 21:41:02 I have had the exact same thought first weed stocks, then crypto now this. The only thing I can find is Tencent on Hong Kong stock exchange but it’s already one of the most expensive stocks in China
5132 2018-01-07 21:41:01 If I had a crystal ball, i would be able to tell you  Welcome to crypto, where everything is possible !
5133 2018-01-07 21:41:01 I’m confused by all of this.  Crypto currency isn’t real currency...so isn’t this just a very few rich speculators playing around with esoteric financial instruments?  What am I missing?

5165 2018-01-07 21:37:52 Any good #crypto currencies I should be investing in?
5166 2018-01-07 21:37:50 This guy knows what's up
5167 2018-01-07 21:37:49 A week is a long time in crypto. I say this a lot

Here's some perspective

Stock market - your stocks are being traded 30 hours a week, 120 hours a month

Crypto - your coins are being traded 168 hours a week, 672 hrs a month
5168 2018-01-07 21:37:46 But you must concede crypto currency is a risky investment, far more than even other riskier instruments such as junk bonds.
5169 2018-01-07 21:37:36 We will see a student loan bubble before the crypto bubble. I think 90% of the coins will go to the way side sooner than later as the actual use ones will dominate the market with the draw for a quick buck goes away.
5170 2018-01-07 21:37:33 People should learn to differentiate between "marketing" and "experts' opinion". Follow a few experts who are objective (whenever possible) and share your values and believes about the world (and the crypto-world in particular). This can save you when things get wild.
5171 2018-01-07 21:37:32 I think this is a great idea. Keep doing this at a rate of 15-25% consistently even over 2 or 3 months and we’ll be golden. 
5172 2018-01-07 21:37:17 No hope in crypto :)
5173 2018-01-07 21:36:56 I just found out something very important Binancec is  the dow jones of wallstreet they only allow the best ico and crypto to be listed on there exchange every other exchange is like the pink  sheets otc markets
5174 2018-01-07 21:36:55 Can you tell me why you believe they are undervalued? Thanks
5175 2018-01-07 21:36:55 
5176 2018-01-07 21:36:53 I give everyone trying to get into crypto a copy of Snow Crash for a reason.
5177 2018-01-07 21:36:48 No. Inserting a back door into software is the number #1 thing a company can do if it wants to lose all respect from the security/cryptography community. It would have been better to say “we got the crypto wrong; won’t do it again” than admit to back-dooring a system.
5178 2018-01-07 21:36:46 I couldn't fit all the stuff I do on one tweet ;) but followed and re-tweeted! Glad to write a testimonial for you and feature @Pinkcoin_ on my new crypto beginners website!

5203 2018-01-07 21:34:14 that's the right thing to do just stop talking with them about crypto

5206 2018-01-07 21:34:07 The MM algos are looking at many variables in the market, reading news and trading patterns in milliseconds, and assessing market sentiment. For expl, if bitcoin sentiment changes, that info will be incorporated into pricing for crypto related stocks also.
5207 2018-01-07 21:34:05 FN are out already and that coin is garbage.
5208 2018-01-07 21:34:00 Please tell me that whatsapp‘s crypto is broken.
5209 2018-01-07 21:33:59 Not only that but the crypto kitties are worth over a certain $$$USD so the law legally requires it to be logged as an official presidential gift and held permanently.

5210 2018-01-07 21:33:46 @Ripple and all big banks are working together. They now have the 2nd biggest hand in the crypto space. Wonder if they are buying up cheap bitcoins by artificially inflating the price of ripple

5221 2018-01-07 21:32:40 My goal in crypto was to read and learn about crypto which i do daily then buy into crypto i think will make a difference, i did just that and made 600% in 1 and a half months. If i make an M that is just a bonus. Your knowledge you give is invaluable to a greenhorn like myself.

5258 2018-01-07 21:30:25 Don’t mean to take anything away from XVG. It’s a great coin. I like how you can turn privacy feature on and off with Wraith. But surely there can be more than just one privacy focused coin in a multi-B, soon multi-T, crypto market.

5267 2018-01-07 21:29:26 FUD everywhere in crypto...
But since the banks and wall street are funding Ripple, this can't be a bad investment.

5270 2018-01-07 21:29:18 The only thing ripple is good for is bringing more money into the crypto space with so many sheep following the herd without doing ANY research what so ever. Why support banks when they profit from your money greatly and dont even give enough interest to cover inflation.

5275 2018-01-07 21:29:04 I'm not down playing the fact that it escalated in an unfortunate manor.. but you need to take responsibility as well. Being a fan & being excited is alright. Excessively invading someones space and drawing attention is not. He's a human being.

5310 2018-01-07 21:26:30 Si le Bitcoin est abandonné, c'est plutôt une bonne nouvelle! Mais il faut surveiller les autres crypto-monnaies et ne pas cesser de dénoncer leur dangerosité!

5346 2018-01-07 21:24:28 industry standard is what I was taught. So when I throw a FIB on it I always try to reload in those zones. The majoity of the time it will hit those zone. I usually place my buy order RIGHT on the .618 level and 70% of the time it gets picked up.

5367 2018-01-07 21:22:44 Would any form of currency, crypto or otherwise, fall inside Henry George's definition of wealth? I don't think so.
5368 2018-01-07 21:22:40 Anyone else get pumped when talking about crypto on the phone? Haha hard to contain
5369 2018-01-07 21:22:38 OK c'est dommage j'aurais pu faire un arbitrage

5384 2018-01-07 21:21:23 I think it's good for it to consolidate a bit, the growth has been quite significant. I'm in $dgb now to earn more for buying $burst.
5385 2018-01-07 21:21:17 Hi I have tried so and sent a request and it seems I got just a random automated notice back from you. My BTC transaction ( 64cad9f895d8 ) is stuck for almost 5 days now. This is like 5 weeks in the crypto world and there is no feedback regarding a possible time frame. Thank you.

5396 2018-01-07 21:20:28 I only heard of it (prior to mainstream popularity) via male dominated spaces: math, crypto, software worlds would certainly leave a their gender-skewed footprint on the early adopters.

But how the hell does it skew from maybe 80% in a nerd subculture to... that?!
5397 2018-01-07 21:20:27 This is a learning process for all of us. Even myself. I constantly study and rely on more experience traders to help me become a master of my field. Trading crypto is how I make a living, so I am never to proud to ask for help. You shouldnt either. Let me know if I can help you.

Works the same if the gift is in crypto. Either way, the rational thing is to sell (for them).

5487 2018-01-07 21:14:24 Ik begrijp het succes van crypto currencies volledig. Banken zijn boeven. Wilt u dat uw spaargeld haar waarde behoud? Stop dan nu alles wat u bezit in crypto coins. Naast meer rendement, investeert u hiermee in uw toekomst.
5488 2018-01-07 21:14:15 Always keep BTC on the side. Not only to invest in other projects but to Hedge off when BTC goes up and the alts go down, your portfolio will remain pretty steady depending on your ratio of BTC to alts.
5489 2018-01-07 21:14:12 Perhaps they wanted someone with experience to get them off Wordpress.

5492 2018-01-07 21:13:54 We sold it all for crypto currency a while back. Best decision ever.
5493 2018-01-07 21:13:52 Thank you for being Beautiful.  Makes waiting on tron so much easier.
5494 2018-01-07 21:13:49 Done in classic way for newbies
5495 2018-01-07 21:13:49 Beschäftigt ihr euch mit crypto,währungen
5496 2018-01-07 21:13:46 I invested X in Dogecoin 3 years ago. A week later it lost 70% it's value. sold 6 months ago for 5x value. Put that into Bitcoin, Litecoin, a few other and I'm now up 20x. IF I'd stayed in Dogecoin...I'd be up the same %. Rising tide of Bitcoin lifts all crypto!
5497 2018-01-07 21:13:46 I hope I win because in my country I can‘t buy bitcoin to start invest in crypto BTC:  1Gzh31BrCfzgmkEjhpwGUugW9grtV7eXkJ

5499 2018-01-07 21:13:37 Can't you just do the research for us and we pump your shitcoin of the moment with you? Or that sounds way too much like MacAfee ?
5500 2018-01-07 21:13:30 @WePowerN crypto has been applied to so many different aspects; gaming, grocery, education, health but we are adding blockchain to green energy. joim us and let's change the world by making it safe #WePower
5501 2018-01-07 21:13:29 Right now no point of selling any Well-known Crypto to my knowledge..  JUST HOLDING

5512 2018-01-07 21:12:54 It is a little yes!  The users obviously represent a part of the market so in having a vote of this restriction it should provided a market sentiment for basically sh*tcoins instead of hearing who can shout the loudest

Been in the crypto business for a while now, but fairly new to Twitter, heard it's a good community, I hope I can get in touch with interesting people here.
5549 2018-01-07 21:10:05 I’m not really too interested in investing in crypto. Only got into bitcoins because of the Silk Road
5550 2018-01-07 21:10:02 Great coin. Bags fuel already for a few weeks. Any target?
5551 2018-01-07 21:09:58 @KylAll @RoyOlse93073002 @Polybius_TV What're your thoughts on the $burst charts? It looks all over the place to me, hard to see a future trajectory

5565 2018-01-07 21:08:43 I think it has a very bright future personally, reddit community seems spooked. I think a lot of people are forgetting its in beta, and in crypto in general are expect returns at unreachable turnaround times.

5575 2018-01-07 21:07:59 Personally I think Tron already had his rise and now will stabalize. An explosive growth due to being registered to an Korean exchange won't change that I'm afraid. But if you hold Tron i hope the best for you:)
5576 2018-01-07 21:07:59 Cons: listed on @MercatoxCom scam exchange that has withheld all xrb
5577 2018-01-07 21:07:47 I don't really follow many of these so called "experts". I do my own research, and invest mid to long term in projects I feel are solid. If they pump up earlier then I expect, I take my profits and invest in the next solid project. I have several projects on my list ready for $$.

5579 2018-01-07 21:07:44 I think it's fair to say this alt season is nowhere near done. If I had to guess I think we continue to see massive buying accumulation for when exchanges open back up for new accounts. Then after that pump  happens we see profit taking. #hodl

5588 2018-01-07 21:06:33 Three crypto rules to live by where you can't go wrong:
1. If everyone's talking about it, you're too late.
2. If the chart looks like a hockey stick on the day/hourly chart, you're too late.
3. If the market cap is in the top 10-20 and there's nothing but a whitepaper, run.

5596 2018-01-07 21:05:37 If something goes wrong with them 99% of the software won’t be secure so security in my app also wouldn’t matter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Unless security in my app is very, very important. I would probably write my own crypto library.

When you over promote and over hype, it works in the opposite direction because it gives off the impression of desperateness.

- 2 10-min presentations to sum-up a nice read (article, book, podcast) 
- Q&A and discussion 

Who's in? Yeah, it's a book club but... #crypto!

5686 2018-01-07 20:59:03 there are unfortunately people who make money this way fake news information pressure only to pump it does the same thing on all the token she buys

5690 2018-01-07 20:58:34 Finally the day has arrived, found exploits running crypto currency mining

5692 2018-01-07 20:58:30 @Sam0711er @AMITNKALRA
I really like your app @getBittracker but could you please add a portfolio overview page which shows the value of all my crypto currency summarized. Would be so helpful.
5693 2018-01-07 20:58:20 Possibly?...But it's not really a stretch when you look at all the indicators...It's speculation, but what isn't in the crypto world?

5695 2018-01-07 20:58:09 Eh no..you can have an answer that may proven to be wrong. My opinion is that there is no link between the value of the Xrp token people trade on exchanges and Ripple the co. It will never be widely used as a settlement currency between banks or any meaningful Crypto currency way
5696 2018-01-07 20:57:57 Wanne swap a cryptopia for a binance account?
5697 2018-01-07 20:57:53 J’ai pas compris comment fonctionnait Delta... tu peux m’aider ? Il y a des crypto intéressantes que j’aimerais suivre.
5698 2018-01-07 20:57:53 Shutter synchronization != Non-state backed transactional commodity. Crypto value is set by network effect, transactional utility and market exuberance.
5699 2018-01-07 20:57:52 > @CryptoStreetPod just interviewed me, it was a really awesome talk! Thanks for inviting me guys! Should be released in the next few days or so :)
5700 2018-01-07 20:57:52 Chased the $DOT pump. Seems logical to me that @Cryptopia_NZ will add more utility to it following the models at other exchanges soon. Huge member growth is going to continue.

Thanks   :)
5713 2018-01-07 20:56:24 haha, I hope you did evaluate CommonCrypto, OpenSSL, and JavaScript with less effort because you know... shit, NSA and Heartbleed happen. Stay safe, use crypto correctly ;)
5714 2018-01-07 20:56:22 That depends on your risk tolerance and strategy. If you want long term growth/dividends then yes. However if you are looking for a short term play than probably not
5715 2018-01-07 20:56:22 hi twitter im a crypto enthusiast and looking for anyone to chat to about crypto tading for 2018

5718 2018-01-07 20:56:04 Spread of Crypto continues to rise.  When will you get in?  Now or later?
5719 2018-01-07 20:55:36 Ive seen it. Thats more about scum bundling dept and selling it to gamblers. Then it falls apart. Gee wonder what could go wrong if we intentionally sign shit mortgages and sell them to the wealthy. I too believe in decentralized #crypto But you can also play the system. #bitcoin
5720 2018-01-07 20:55:34 @vergecurrency is the official #verge currency announcement Twitter handle.

5728 2018-01-07 20:55:00 I'll sell my bitfinex account I never used it I just use binance
5729 2018-01-07 20:54:56 Mais c'est pas dieu possible d'être aussi bête. C'est un coup à ce que l'on se ramasse un éditorial crypto-mystique complet de Finkie sur le sens caché des hommages islamo-gauchiste, avec une semaine de polémique twitter derrière.

5738 2018-01-07 20:53:57 I just sold some Eth for more ICX. Eth is slow moving, I can always buy more back. This is not an investment advice, just telling you what I did.
5739 2018-01-07 20:53:25 Coming from a science background I believe it is an absolute necessity for quality assurance and 3rd party auditing, something which the crypto space crucially needs right now as a growing market. This is why im going long and heavy in my investment in @Quantstamp $QSP.
5740 2018-01-07 20:53:24 Hola Javi, para realizar operaciones con crypto indicas comprar BTC
En coinbase. No se puede operar con ETH? Gracias.
5741 2018-01-07 20:53:21 I agree. But honestly if you bought bitcoin after 2016 you’re a noob. Before then, the only reason to get in was for the fascinating technology. The gains were not there. Most people on twitter bought their first crypto in 2017
5742 2018-01-07 20:53:18 You should try crypto Vine too

I’m always passed by someone else for a job so I’m also investing in crypto for a chance to buy a house

5764 2018-01-07 20:51:28 A unifying message, but I’m going to continue to reflexively cringe whenever I hear someone refer to crypto currency as crypto.
5765 2018-01-07 20:51:27 To be fair Verge already had some problems earlier that they seem to have learned from. Their newly released tech is also supposed to be top of the class. That’s why this crypto just might be undervalued right now ;) #xvg $xvg #Verge

5774 2018-01-07 20:50:56 Think this course will be really cool! Would also love to see you expand on this to be a real blockchain course and explore different uses outside crypto (which is well known but niched). Exploring block chain on mobile could be huge!

5793 2018-01-07 20:49:52 I am riding crypto, that's like saying I reinvented the horse drawn carriage with the auromobile but can no longer ride a horse now.
5794 2018-01-07 20:49:52 That’s the Spirit !

5796 2018-01-07 20:49:50 I disagree, the market cap grew 250 billion in 2 weeks. a year ago it was only 70billon. Crypto is growing really fast. Therefore no one really knows how high/fast it will reach
5797 2018-01-07 20:49:49 :) bakamadım
5798 2018-01-07 20:49:47 Today we added @RCN_token to our own portfolio. We like the concept, team communication is good, marketing is on point and timeline looks sound 
#Cryptocurrency #altcoin $rcn $eth
5799 2018-01-07 20:49:34 What false promise from Tron? #Trx. They’re up 3K+. % in the last 30 days, let your investment bake, your portfolio won’t fatten overnight.
5800 2018-01-07 20:49:31 mine is fine
5801 2018-01-07 20:49:29 hahahahaha

5808 2018-01-07 20:49:08 @ummjackson What’s your opinion on etc and it’s future in the crypto world ?
5809 2018-01-07 20:49:07 If the community only cares about the price, theres a good chance that they will dump for the perceived next best thing. Real world application, a real team, and a real community is what is going to last in crypto, don't be fooled by what you read.
5810 2018-01-07 20:49:02 @realdonaldtrump buy some crypto #TRX and chill :)
5811 2018-01-07 20:49:02 Bro what about #crypto!?
5812 2018-01-07 20:49:00 I’ll be happy to sell my binance or bittrex account if the price is right. Let me know. #binance #bittrex #registration #crypto #btc #alts #forsale #accounts
5813 2018-01-07 20:48:56 Why you only push Tron? Let’s push a good company. Right now Tron is like the movie, Starts off bad and then just trails off.

5823 2018-01-07 20:48:10 Guys dont do this, this is the reason why the Crypto market is so f***** up! You guys start using your crypto trading accounts for the wrong reasons and then you will get the real serious crypto investors accounts suspended. Stop this immediately guys!
5824 2018-01-07 20:48:10 Tron customer communication and partnership xvg no communication rumor and night pants !!! No, but seriously you really believe in Santa Claus ???
5825 2018-01-07 20:48:04 No wonder they call it the sleeping giant.
5826 2018-01-07 20:48:02 As well as the crypto currency market. Maybe it's something you should address.
5827 2018-01-07 20:47:59 Looking forward to buying crypto with PayPal 
5828 2018-01-07 20:47:58 I do believe crypto will hit that overall by EOY (end of year).  I also believe that #XRP will take the #1 spot at some point early this year or mid-2018 at the latest.  Thanks for reading and dropping in a comment!  
5829 2018-01-07 20:47:56 Download the app coinbase then register then go on Kucoin or cryptoia exchange register then I can help you
5830 2018-01-07 20:47:49 did you accidentally buy 100 btc instead of 1 ? :D

5835 2018-01-07 20:47:16 well apparantly $etc is the next to pump, because holy moly the shill is real on twitter. Its like the crypto influencers started their own pump & dump group, and twitter is the medium
5836 2018-01-07 20:47:12 thanks for the optimism
5837 2018-01-07 20:47:11 Crypto is nothing but virtual currency. Its like money in ur bank account. U can pay people in these currencies too.

5850 2018-01-07 20:46:09 I Have come to realize in Crypto that there is a difference between “being” a n00b and “acting” like a n00b. 

Most of us besides the OG’s in the grand scheme of things including myself are noobs. 

The difference lies in how you present yourself.

More vaporware is not what crypto needs. Why don’t they make a product and then add it to the market?

5873 2018-01-07 20:44:24 So, quick question what books do read about crypto? Or articles have you read
5874 2018-01-07 20:44:20 a timebomb? the last hours was a blood bath.. but nvm hodl and try to RELAX :P
5875 2018-01-07 20:44:19 Trx is hurting my portfolio like a bitch. I don’t understand it. It’s a good project with a good team. Why does it lose value day after day? Is it because crypto markets are filled with idiots?
5876 2018-01-07 20:44:18 You think so?
5877 2018-01-07 20:44:14 As a newbie (1 month in trading crypto) this makes total sense. I made my newbie mistakes 3 weeks ago. A week is a long time in this world. I believe in $TRX ideas. I'm investing in them. If I'm wrong then so be it
5878 2018-01-07 20:44:13 use it to pay the debt dumbo. or just invest in crypto

5896 2018-01-07 20:43:18 Just my opinion of the next #crypto to be added to @coinbase in order of likelihood:

Most likely:
@Ripple $XRP

Would be nice:
@Dashpay $DASH

Least likely but I'd love to see a cheaper alternative for new investors:
@DigiByteCoin #DGB

5910 2018-01-07 20:42:34 No. It's a sham of a website masquerading as a crypto exchange. Issues abound. Use at your own peril.

5926 2018-01-07 20:41:19 Since NXS is far superior to most other crypto through resistance to asic and quantum... I think the 5.5 mil is a good investment. @NxsEarth devs has a pretty damn solid goal. I haven't seen any other altcoins that have a real mission statement.
5927 2018-01-07 20:41:17 Haha! Good1

5930 2018-01-07 20:41:01 There needs to be a t-shirt for crypto for that. :D

5941 2018-01-07 20:40:24 @eToro hi, 2 questions:
1) how long does it take for API access to be granted. I've been waiting about 2 weeks now
2) what is the timeline for the crypto wallets? you guys are going to suffer when $ethos is up and running so i would get a move on if i were you.
5942 2018-01-07 20:40:24 now we will see institutional money start funding this already over valued asset full of fraudulent money, this will be the housing bubble 2.0

5953 2018-01-07 20:39:39 I Don't support XRP. Even if it's making me a shot ton of money. Doesn't feel right. The whole purpose of crypto is the be independent of the government and the insured banking systems. Watch the Big Short movie and be informed... Great movie, scary story.
5954 2018-01-07 20:39:34 Concerned the current crypto craze is teaching luck, speculation, short term thinking over determination, hard work, long term thinking.
5955 2018-01-07 20:39:33 Dont EVER take part in a pump group. They dont exist to make you money, they exist to make the people at the top money.

A 2500 member group were told to buy $MAGN 30 minutes ago. Funny how it was already up 2000% a few hours before.

 I m also trying to acquiring crypto currency to buy me a cryptogirlfriend...
5999 2018-01-07 20:36:25 Just wondering what exactly you saw in the charts that made you imagine a downmove being likely. Like a specific indicator or break of a price level?
6000 2018-01-07 20:36:25 Bwahahahahaha! The FA of DragonChain is massive. Blockchain as a platform, hundreds of ICOs, amazing organization/team, outreach to young devs, and a great place for enterprise to set up their blockchain businesses. I’m in LOVE! 
6001 2018-01-07 20:36:24 Well, I was invested in a bunch of coins until @cryptsy absconded with my money. After I was able to recover from that, I've invested in any crypto that's not a pre-mine.
6002 2018-01-07 20:36:21 
6003 2018-01-07 20:36:18 No its not too late to buy, we are at the beginning of crypto
6004 2018-01-07 20:36:17 I don't see 1k this year unless there's a perfect storm, but I think $100 by June would be a safe bet.
6005 2018-01-07 20:36:11 listen people, there is more to life than #crypto and #bitcoin and arguing about #xrp. I'm just not sure what it is yet.
6006 2018-01-07 20:36:09 Oh yes, you only lose money if you sell and TRX is going alot further than this.
6007 2018-01-07 20:36:08 Done
6008 2018-01-07 20:36:02 How much? Or you can mine other crypto
6009 2018-01-07 20:35:59 I do, but I make a conscious effort to not discuss crypto on Twitter because there are many others on here doing so who know much more than me. Take advice from them, not me 
6010 2018-01-07 20:35:57 In a few months Bitcoin will have more forks than Ikea.

6015 2018-01-07 20:35:27 New crypto investors are scared. Many are overinvested. They don't understand what they're invested in, but they inherently understand and are comforted by being part of a group. Lashing out at outsiders confirms their place in a group.

6022 2018-01-07 20:35:01 If I had to allocate new capital into crypto, I would:

• Sit primarily in a big name: BTC, LTC, ETH and NOT cash to ride bull market wave.

• Allocate ~10% to trade alts w/ high risk / reward.

• HODL dips.

Not investing advice, just my thoughts.

6026 2018-01-07 20:34:48 2/2 - WGR - this is the "gambling token". Massive potential. The online gambling market is huge, especially DraftKings and FanDuel, but they have a problem. Laws in some states prevent it. WGR solves that problem and since IRS considers crypto property, WGR is perfect! Watch out!
6027 2018-01-07 20:34:47 So for now I hodl I guess..
6028 2018-01-07 20:34:44 @TheBurntChip @Will__NE @JMXFifa @Callux I genuinely beg you all to be careful. Crypto shows every sign of being a bubble at its peak. It would be a shame if all your hard work on YouTube was lost. I would hate for any of you to be hurt.
6029 2018-01-07 20:34:40 Too much noise in the world of #Crypto
6030 2018-01-07 20:34:39 Ask an adult to explain my comment to you, as you alone could not understand it. It doesn't give any indication that I believe XRP will do badly but simply implies that it's succes will be the end of abundancy in crypto-world. A love being called ignorant by peeps like you!
6031 2018-01-07 20:34:38 Still in on CND?

6101 2018-01-07 20:28:57 What crypto doesn’t pump and dump? They all do this and they all continue to go up
6102 2018-01-07 20:28:57 ! Amazing
6103 2018-01-07 20:28:56 Just realized, how undervalued $ADA actually is. 

- Just sayin.

No financial advise here!

6107 2018-01-07 20:28:47  okay, this caught my attention for a moment.
6108 2018-01-07 20:28:43 If you want privacy... then go for Verge. It is the best privacy-oriented crypto currency. #XVG $xvg #vergecurrency

6110 2018-01-07 20:28:38 It's $VTC by FAR. Hopefully $ARK will start moving. Today was a solid start. It's one of my top 15 bags.
6111 2018-01-07 20:28:32 Member when you made this joke with $XVG, I member.
6112 2018-01-07 20:28:32 I’m beginning to think you’d trade ADA for a buffalo chicken wrap.
6113 2018-01-07 20:28:31 LOLLLLLL YO MY HEART. I was about to put all my fiat into crypto the pump would have been godly
6114 2018-01-07 20:28:24 Nah you're right, think almost everything is overpriced right now.
6115 2018-01-07 20:28:23 Most exchanges won't take fiat only crypto
6116 2018-01-07 20:28:17 It will retest 750-800 before it makes another run. Has to consolidate.
6117 2018-01-07 20:28:17 With so many exchanges not accepting new users at the moment, $alts season has just began. 

Get ready to see some much new money flow in the next few months.

When $crypto exchanges open registrations again, prices you think are high now, will seem cheap!

6131 2018-01-07 20:27:34 Blockchains might but useful, but coins are just a pump and dump scheme honestly. If you were tired of hot air and pontificating from western mideast "experts", crypto experts sound more like a new age cult.

6158 2018-01-07 20:26:13 @officialmcafee $FUN crypto by FunFair Tech. Take a look at its application in their industry. Very interesting.
6159 2018-01-07 20:26:06 i'm a firm believer the coins themselves have no intrinsic value, only fomo value driven by the speculative fervor of supply/demand asymmetry. i kept a nominal amount in case crypto 100xes from here, but little enough that i'm fine with it 0xing.
6160 2018-01-07 20:26:05 In Poker a whale is a really bad player. In Crypto, it's an end boss.

6163 2018-01-07 20:26:00 @MftDesai 1. Is trading of Crypto / digital currency like Bitcoin and other ALT coins halal in terms of Islam? I mean buying a coin at low rate and then sell it on higher rate. Secondly, Is cloud mining of different digital coins halal?

It just refuses to just vent away.

6200 2018-01-07 20:23:55 For Crypto Trading, if you want to build a 1000 position for someone,25% mean you buy 250,50% mean you buy 500,close 50% mean you see 500 at target price

6207 2018-01-07 20:23:32 CryptoGirl Tip #15: No matter how pro you are, DON'T invest all your money in #crypto . The rich always have multiple sources of income - real estate, mutual funds, bank deposits etc

6210 2018-01-07 20:23:06 Out of curiosity, what is the typical current range of processing fees? (The kind of crypto I do is obviously of an entirely different nature than "crypto", so I really have no idea)

6221 2018-01-07 20:22:11 Crypto currency is interesting not only can you make money, but the fact that it brings people from all over the world together to have a conversation about something. I have not invested in it. I just like the conversations.

6231 2018-01-07 20:21:46 Less than a week ago I brought $NAS to your attention. @nebulasio is a protocol made by two NEO founders. This  is not on the big exchanges yet and has almost 3x’ed since last week. This coin’s fundamentals will continue to drive it. #bitcoin #mooncoin #crypto #ethereum
6232 2018-01-07 20:21:44 @rinat32 Hey, I'm selling my Bittrex account. DM me if you are interested. Fast deal
6233 2018-01-07 20:21:25 in my observation, bubble is kept puff't by BTC though. As it breathes, profits go back into Alts. There is also the stabilizer in lack of fiat conversion. profits just sit, and get reinvested. As the crypto system matures, movement and bubbles will be harder to maintain.
6234 2018-01-07 20:21:24 Are people taking the piss? Dentacoin with a circulating supply value of over $1.8 billion. And Poloniex appearing on CNBC. What the firetruck is going on? For all the potential, there's a whole lots of fkn insanity in #crypto right now

6237 2018-01-07 20:21:02 My team set up, we all gonna eat and hit 7 figures of crypto currency in 2018.
6238 2018-01-07 20:20:59 Quick social test: If I lead an ICO for a well known brand within a growing +$100 Billion industry and a real need for blockchain tech to solve several glaring issues. How many would buy in? (Give a  for yes) #ICO #CRYPTO
6239 2018-01-07 20:20:50 Supply and demand. Demand is high due to crypto mining and recent boom in other currencies.
6240 2018-01-07 20:20:50 I doubt it's just the currency that Crypto is going to turn all around.
6241 2018-01-07 20:20:40 el mercado no es un casino, no compreís pq una crypto haya subido mucho y penseis que os la estaís perdiendo. Sin método y disciplina la ruina tarde o temprana está asegurada. Desde trading cyrptos fomentamos la busqueda de valores en fase de acumulación no en fase explosiva

6250 2018-01-07 20:20:18 When :)?
6251 2018-01-07 20:20:08 @MichaelGCypher you have a substantial amount of LTC. I'm only assuming that's from well placed purchases at a great price. For a new person in crypto world, any advice on picking coin that have a future. From a couple days of losses, I've learned that trading isn't for me.
6252 2018-01-07 20:20:08 It’s inevitable with any market but there is WAY too much emotional attachment in crypto. Believing and being a fanatic are different things.

6287 2018-01-07 20:16:59 It totally defeats the purpose of a: free, decentralized, secure value store / currency that can not be controlled, blocked, manipulated by a centralized entity. It's the reason that Bitcoin aka Crypto Currency was born in the first place. Now we hand the power back 2 banks? WTF

6333 2018-01-07 20:13:08 Marketcap is driving this perception, but that’s a terrible metric. Marketcap in $crypto is next to meaningless. If you sort by volume you can see we are still very small. That said a bunch of individual projects are in a bubble and WILL collapse - that could drive a bear cycle.
6334 2018-01-07 20:12:56 do your self a favor and don't buy into hype of $XRP ... i thought we want crypto to move away from banks and now you want to run back? $XRP is not mined, like bitcoin, it's created out of thin air ... banks create #XRP and sell it for 3$. you're literally giving them free money.
6335 2018-01-07 20:12:49 every $crypto person has a moment where they make a choice to sell or $hodl.

6337 2018-01-07 20:12:46 But RippleNet doesn't need #XRP. 

Banks using RipplesNet Software to replace SWIFT & saving tons $$$, makes perfect sense. So why use a highly volatile crypto token to settle transactions? Just to add layers of uncertainty and complications?

6369 2018-01-07 20:10:31 amongst other things, the more highly traded a currency is..the more its value will increase right? I assume this is how crypto currencies work too...there's a finite number...if many people want it..it accumulates value & boom you make money ...i think

6399 2018-01-07 20:08:47 Waqar Bhai thank you for your guidance about crypto currency  #ouicoin #WaqarZaka #Cryptoaya
6400 2018-01-07 20:08:39 Used to just ignore Bitcoin/crypto currency but doing the research and it’s not as stupid as I once thought. Still not done doing research and won’t buy any this week but may one day

6403 2018-01-07 20:08:21 The crypto currencies will generate wealth but only for those who sell in time.
6404 2018-01-07 20:08:19 Got some $$ to spend. I’m interested in ICO’s. 

Any good idea? Thank you.

6407 2018-01-07 20:08:11 Hi man this is normal in Crypto! Check out Tron! They had the same nice ride to the moon few days ago, and then some clever people started fud again, so they could buy some cheap coins they missed. 
No matter what XVG is an unique privacy coin and when the fud is cleared ->MOON
6408 2018-01-07 20:08:08 Lmao at all these noobs rushing to the cheap coins and shitcoins from cryptopia, they are going to get dumped on so hard and fast

6437 2018-01-07 20:05:42 That’s really aggressive. 

We don’t need to talk at all, I just wanted to help you understand what we do.

If you change your mind it’d be great to talk more.
6438 2018-01-07 20:05:36 Selling my polo account as well will give you 50% commision if you can sell it for over 2 BTC.  Please let me know
6439 2018-01-07 20:05:33 I think it will. There's just too much trash in the top 100. There are coins that have nothing but a whitepaper and a dream and $25+ billion valuation (Cardano). Not even crypto can defy all the rules all the time. I'm just hoping it won't happen quite yet...

6454 2018-01-07 20:04:33 Diversify. Once you’ve made profits, take some of them and spend them, save them do whatever, just move them from crypto currencies. Reinvest your capital and some profits in crypto and build it up that way.

6529 2018-01-07 19:59:16 Some new to crypto YouTubers have been pumping this coin for a little while because of its super low price per coin.
6530 2018-01-07 19:59:12 tell the bottom 90% to quit wasting money on non necessities ie cell phones, car, flashy clothes and by stocks instead of crypto
6531 2018-01-07 19:59:02 Kucoin...lots of profits to be made there
6532 2018-01-07 19:58:57 @Haejin_Crypto SYSCOIN PLEASE !!!
6533 2018-01-07 19:58:52 I like the sound of this 
6534 2018-01-07 19:58:46 Will have something to do with the currency exchange rate while exchanges also add some on top !
6535 2018-01-07 19:58:39 No ...McDonald’s you wouldn’t be able to do Crypto ...but my job I can do both!!  :p
6536 2018-01-07 19:58:30 ...It was so unfortunate when i learnt what happened..i and folks were badly piped cause of that......dou..its old news now...
6537 2018-01-07 19:58:27 Kann ich in Crypto zahlen?
6538 2018-01-07 19:58:27 What do we stand to gain following you?
6539 2018-01-07 19:58:25 Are you still 100% alts?
6540 2018-01-07 19:58:21 What phase asking for proof instead just believing your word? Poor haha
6541 2018-01-07 19:58:09 like I told - it will be just starting. When a coin/token starts new there will be a first token sale through their website. 

Afterwards crypto-exchanges will start to get in.

6545 2018-01-07 19:58:00 and when we find out why?
6546 2018-01-07 19:57:58 When you are ready to collect your profit just sell it on hitbtc for ETH and then transfer it.  I know their DCN fees are outrageous
6547 2018-01-07 19:57:56 I'll offer mine for 4.9BTC
6548 2018-01-07 19:57:52 Valid point except for USDT. No way they are really holding $1.5B of fiat. The sooner that boil is lanced, the better for the overall crypto market.
6549 2018-01-07 19:57:50 News coming tomorrow for both #xvg and #trx, waiting to see how that affects the market. Also throw some money at #rdd coin on bittrex. Thats starting to rise.

6550 2018-01-07 19:57:45 Actually symphony was a long time ago. It’s also not on our github. I think you’re either looking on the wrong github or you don’t know much about code. I’d be happy to show you how to install our microservices.

Re SONM, I’d say we’ve talked about that quite a bit now.
6551 2018-01-07 19:57:43 Im about to start an investment group specializing in crypto, if yall interested hmu
6552 2018-01-07 19:57:41 XRP送金はやすぎて
6553 2018-01-07 19:57:34 I wish $UBQ would overtake $ETH as a genuine, drama free platform for serious crypto development.

6557 2018-01-07 19:57:07 やっぱBTC送金遅いなぁ、、
6558 2018-01-07 19:56:59 a feeling? bnb is the place where all tx fees go. So yes, it will go up after it reopens and new flux of $$/people.. but don't hold it because as far as I know people don't take bnb tokens for mortgages/rent/etc ;)
6559 2018-01-07 19:56:53 But ‘crypto-Narnia’ is a little way off so why not be realistic and make a bit of money in the meantime.
6560 2018-01-07 19:56:45 @hitbtc When can I withdraw my $STORM ? Did a test transfer which is still pending.
6561 2018-01-07 19:56:41 @chijs goedenavond meneer van der chijs. Ik ben pas een paar maanden geleden begonnen met het kopen en traden van crypto munten. Ik ben zelf groot fan van iota. Mag ik zo brutaal zijn om te vragen wat u daar van vind als crypto ondernemer? Mvg barney poelarends
6562 2018-01-07 19:56:35 What subscription plan do u recommend to bitmex newbies?
6563 2018-01-07 19:56:33 Finally. Vacation is over. Time to slay some crypto and ramp up adoption...in the morning. First I gotta catch up on my memes. 


6564 2018-01-07 19:56:31 #dropXRP challenge . Do it because you’re not a greedy fuck . Do it because the best part of crypto is that we don’t need banks anymore! Do it because decentralization matters! Do it because #xvg had twice the gains . Lol just do it and tag us !!!
6565 2018-01-07 19:56:30 There ain't no pump like a Shil(l)Bert pump. 

It's oh so quiet.......

6575 2018-01-07 19:55:59 if you're into crypto you should buy some ethereum now/today/this week, make your money and dip.

6580 2018-01-07 19:55:47 $XRP is listed on Bithumb for $4usd. 

Bittrex & Binance are $2.78 & $2.77 respectively. 

Korean markets pay a premium for most crypto. 

This market differential skews Coin Market Cap listings.

6581 2018-01-07 19:55:41 @BitcoinErrorLog I think 2018 will be the year that people get sick of Roger Ver,  & see him for what he is, sell bcash & buy BTC or LTC. Sad that Roger Ver will be the 1st to dump and make a killing.  But that’s why he got in it in the 1st place.
6582 2018-01-07 19:55:35 @musicoins when you are saying "Sending encrypted audio file to the P2P network", are you sending the actual file or just the file hash? #musicoin #crypto #blockchain
6583 2018-01-07 19:55:35 Y’all could invest in Crypto and just watch your money grow instead of putting all that work into money boards

6587 2018-01-07 19:55:14 there are more barriers to entry w/crypto. many would-be investors are worried about converting crypto profits back into real money. converting stock or real estate profits into $ has never been a widespread worry.
6588 2018-01-07 19:55:13 yeah

6599 2018-01-07 19:54:15 1) By no means am I a success story when it comes to #crypto, however having just obtained my 2nd bitcoin and starting off with only a $2500CAD investment I thought I would share a few things I've picked up along the way.
6600 2018-01-07 19:54:10 The hostility 
6601 2018-01-07 19:54:09 If you believe crypto is about currencies, then you don't understand it.
6602 2018-01-07 19:54:07 Would you be open to sharing what  % of your original crypto investment is still in crypto?
6603 2018-01-07 19:54:03 I’m selling my full crypto portfolio including all wallets, exchanges etc.! 175 BTC. Take a gamble! ;)
6604 2018-01-07 19:54:02 $XRP with a nice uptrend, once news breaks getting ready for $4

FYI its still a shitcoin which goes against all fundamentals of crypto C and decentralization. But hey, profit is profit.
6605 2018-01-07 19:53:58 Help: Which #crypto #debit card in #Europe is not issued by @wcpayments?

6612 2018-01-07 19:53:28 Do your fucking research
Where do you go to when looking for roadmaps & updates?
6613 2018-01-07 19:53:17 I bought cheapest -- CND. Have no clue what it is, what CND stands for or what the chart even looks like. Crypto is a pure gamble imho so I went all in

6615 2018-01-07 19:53:15 That wasn't a fake account. I'm sorry you don't have enough intelligence to DYOR and use deductive reasoning skills, but alas, no one with half a brain believes it was a fake account.

6625 2018-01-07 19:52:40 Now I really doubt the credibility of predictions every crypto expert make on twitter. 98% of them are false. None was sure that ripple will hit $1 in last month. Some really good experts had wrongly estimated $btc above $20k in January.

6659 2018-01-07 19:50:34 Crypto is a game of speculation, remember that. I invested in $PAC over a week ago believing in @PaccoinDEVs will live up to the promises they are making for the next few months. There is no doubt that I consider #PacCoin a long term investment.
6660 2018-01-07 19:50:28 Both. I don't feel i am holding enough xvg though. Maybe a tip to bring my xvg hodl closer to my trx one? :)

6665 2018-01-07 19:49:53 $lisk, medium , long term hold bought bag 1 at 9$ and bag 2 at $21. I have a feeling this coin is on course to have eth march on this year as eth did last year. Fundamentals and team both are strong. Feb should be interesting.

6676 2018-01-07 19:49:08 It took me forever it seems to make my first 20k in #Crypto. It took me from Jan 1st to Jan 5th to make my previous (not last) 20k.

6678 2018-01-07 19:49:06 I’d go with option C - we know what we’re doing and have four years experience with services used in production across 200+ sites.

6682 2018-01-07 19:48:41 I used to assume that too haha But its the random caps that gives it away imho
6683 2018-01-07 19:48:41 I was pointing out how vague your definitions of "natural" and "alpha" are. Polyandry is a strategy in some animals.  Also ur ideas abt what human males and females can do is incredibly limited. Anyway this is not the point of the math problem.
6684 2018-01-07 19:48:32 tfw the crypto you invested in is growing rapidly but you only spent a little bit so your gains are fucking chump change :))
6685 2018-01-06 23:59:57 Chart,  almost finished consoledating within the triangle. Alot of fake sell walls on both bittrex and binance. Price is kept down artificially by big whales. If big guys go such a length for a crypto , than you know you got gold on your hands. And don't forget wrath release ;)
6686 2018-01-06 23:59:41 I bought #tron #trx and #XVG $xvg  neck to neck race to $1.
6687 2018-01-06 23:59:39 Without a doubt. Our world will not be what we know it today.
6688 2018-01-06 23:59:38 I really think these elected "officials" think they can regulate (control) peer-to-peer, decentralized tokens, that are borderless.  The more they try, the more valuable the privacy tokens will become in 2018.  Crypto = gov must rethink taxation.
6689 2018-01-06 23:59:38 Im ready to ruin some more #paypig wallets! Come bow and tribute to my perfect #feet and body. I wish you #losers were smart enough to tribute with crypto currencies but AGC and paypal will do

6723 2018-01-06 23:58:19 When all you want to do is trade soem crypto but ever major exchange isn’t accepting new users.
6724 2018-01-06 23:58:13 It’s tanking big time... a little research goes along way... some of these coins are only available in shady exchanges for reason.. they are shady coins
6725 2018-01-06 23:58:09 Nothing is surprising anymore
6726 2018-01-06 23:58:08 $xmy has a rather clear path for another 10-15% gain with a little volume. Get in on the action for some short gains and #hodl for bigger earnings #crypto #altcoin #altcoins #myriadcoin #cryptocurrency

6734 2018-01-06 23:57:36 I haven't seen spreads like this between the markets in a very long time... We thought the ladder half of 2017 was crazy. #Crypto is looking for another massive run, early.
6735 2018-01-06 23:57:33 Haha yea I was kidding
6736 2018-01-06 23:57:28 This would be awesome
6737 2018-01-06 23:57:27 Yep. I don't think the majority of people understand the scope of what we are dealing with. Everything will change over the next ten years.
6738 2018-01-06 23:57:23 Whats the next coin to invest in?:
Let me just say.. add more to $DNT. Awesome project with long term potential. Holding nice volume. $Crypto

6750 2018-01-06 23:55:54 It would be my pleasure! I'm also compiling thoughts on the benefits of reading crypto books & this is a perfect testament to the value of a piece that's been methodically researched and refined over time.

6787 2018-01-06 23:52:40 At the end of the day... ask yourself is banks will ever go away. You either evolve in the crypto environment/eco system or get left behind. Where do you want to be in 5,10,20 years? I would imagine ahead. XRP.

Thank you in advance.
6792 2018-01-06 23:52:15 I also highly recommend picking up some $KCS once you get signed-up on on KuCoin Exchange. It boomed today for good reason.

6794 2018-01-06 23:51:59 Ok off to two children's birthday parties with my kids. I'm tapping out of Twitter and crypto til the arvo. Stay safe!
6795 2018-01-06 23:51:36 Haha alot of people were ready to dump ignis right after the fork, but now that bittrex give them this dead time they are starting to think hmm i maybe should just hodl this... 
6796 2018-01-06 23:51:34 $ZCL sitting around $200. Still cheaper than buying BTC for the fork. Even if ZCL dumps to nothing after the fork, your $BTCP will at the very least retain value, and most likely . $200 is cheap compared to the upside of 5-10x. Ur fuckin around if you ain’t strapped in #crypto
6797 2018-01-06 23:51:21 Haha C’est pas si facile si ta de l’émotion, j’ai un amis qui a acheté au ATH et il ne c’est pas éduqué sur les crypto du coup il a revendu à -40%. Mais personnellement je vois ça sur le très long terme et surtout comment va être l’internet de demain

By "BTC reversal pattern" you mean BTC is going to keep going up again (cuz that's what I'm seeing now)?

6814 2018-01-06 23:49:50 It’s also going to play a large role in attractive new people to crypto! Baby boomers hold so much power and they won’t touch stuff they can’t yell at someone for, my dad taught me this lol
6815 2018-01-06 23:49:48 Listen. @cosscrypto and their coin are running. Do not buy $Coss from their exchange. They have people waiting weeks for withdrawals but are taking deposits. AVOID. #EasyMoney , unless someone steals it. #bitcoin #ripple $BTC $XRP $NEO $QTUM $GAS $DRGN $XVG $TRX

6818 2018-01-06 23:49:35 #lindacoin is up next! Just like #xvg #trx! It's still a sub penny crypto, but not for long!
6819 2018-01-06 23:49:17 Not true at all.. it’s a fork. A completely new coin.
6820 2018-01-06 23:49:10 May the odds be in my favor
6821 2018-01-06 23:49:03 Impressive stuff! How many more after crypto was added?

6828 2018-01-06 23:48:35 No fork, coin burn 1:1000
6829 2018-01-06 23:48:26 All other hobbies have taken a back seat since I got into crypto
6830 2018-01-06 23:48:17 there is trading on crypto...crypto never sleeps.
6831 2018-01-06 23:48:16 @CryptoTaxUK Quick question, if I use crypto directly to purchase an item, I don't need to worry about any sort of tax doing that right?
6832 2018-01-06 23:48:09 But yo this bitcoin crypto currency doe
6833 2018-01-06 23:48:00 Exchanges are greedy bastards, if they close registrations it's because they are VERY overwhelmed, this alts season will be legendary. #crypto

6837 2018-01-06 23:47:43 maybe they mean "satoshi" thay can not be that blind
6838 2018-01-06 23:47:38 في خطوة تبدو مماثلة لتلك التي اتخذها "جيمي ديمون" المدير التنفيذي لبنك "جي بي مورغان"، حظر بنك وول ستريت "ميريل لينش" مستشاريه الماليين من شراء استثماراتٍ ذات صلة بعملة بيتكوين لعملائهم.
 فقد جاء القرار لأن البنك الرئيسي لديه مخاوف "تتعلق بمدى ملاءمة وصلاحية مواصفات منتجه."

6841 2018-01-06 23:47:17 I was pumped thinking $DRGN would open at $0.15. Now well over $4.
6842 2018-01-06 23:47:14 I'll buy into skrittcoin before it becomes eleven grand for one. Can you ensure that the volatility stays somewhat less volatile than that other crypto currency that sort of sounds similar?

6852 2018-01-06 23:46:48 Good luck with #crypto. It is going to take off but for how long. Too reminiscent of V2000, Betamax then VHS scenario.

6865 2018-01-06 23:46:08 Hell, some of them act like some crypto youtubers were acting a couple months ago. ex. ChainCoin. Then again, a fool and his money are soon departed.
6866 2018-01-06 23:46:06 It's weird to me that people in crypto twitter care about follower count. I'm literally only here to look at your charts and try to take your coins.

6869 2018-01-06 23:45:51 Dear Crypto Community. Dont buy $HUSH for the $BTCH fork. The dev stole the idea from $BTCP and now does everything to shill people. These kind of people should not be in the Crypto world. He screwed his Reputation for some quick Dollars. 

Show him what you think of SCAMMERS!

6908 2018-01-06 23:42:52 Yeah when Grandma is on Telegram asking the crypto chat group for a good micro cap to throw 1 BTC into ASAP then you know it’s a bubble.
6909 2018-01-06 23:42:49 I can't help but notice some big firms are moving against #crypto. It's almost like they don't want us "regular folk" to have any money.

6912 2018-01-06 23:42:43 Is the course a one time fee or is it recurring? Plus I think I've seen we're able to pay with crypto? In The U.S. thanks! @Cryptonary_

6919 2018-01-06 23:42:20 If 1% of the supposed $500bn+ "market cap" for the crypto space was set aside and used to build out actual infrastructure, then scaling (for one thing) should absolutely not even remotely be an issue. Even today.

6938 2018-01-06 23:41:13 why?
6939 2018-01-06 23:41:08 Are you insane? This is the exact opposite of the purpose of Crypto.
6940 2018-01-06 23:41:04 when normies say they have 400 shares of 'coin'... stop
6941 2018-01-06 23:41:00 All crypto sites do. We should be iterating much faster but there are so many fires to put out... ddos attacks, server services overloaded. Support under water... and in p2p fraud control is a nitemare.

6946 2018-01-06 23:40:35 Crypto can be suppressed but not killed. They can regulate. But if they choose to strangle the country will see an outflow of capital and talent. Or they could shut the internet down.
6947 2018-01-06 23:40:29 That's awesome! Crypto is a big learning curve but if you're fortunate enough to find some good coins early then it makes it that much better :)
6948 2018-01-06 23:40:28 Just stop using this exchange.
6949 2018-01-06 23:40:24 He’s just salty watching all his money stuck in a shitty entry while the rest of crypto is going  ... trial by  grasshopper... learn from the lesson or crash and burn...

6964 2018-01-06 23:39:31 Would adding of crypto to existing services count? e.g. Kik w/ Kin?
6965 2018-01-06 23:39:31 I don’t think it will sit there very long either; I hope people got there profits out.

6967 2018-01-06 23:39:15 1BTCが18万円になったときすでに，円からの両替には心理的抵抗が。10万円〜12万円が当たり前だったので。今は45万円以上！
その点BitClubでは，前の投資がBTCを生み出してくれます！
ドル投資なので，円から投資する分には同じだし，もっているBTCからなら少なくて済みます！
6968 2018-01-06 23:39:11 saw a tweet once, a guy bought one pizza for 10K bitcoin long time ago

6973 2018-01-06 23:38:37 Speculation.  If #reddcoin was wise they would start limiting their supply a bit and it would really go up.  It will stay under 50 cents until they do something about the seemingly endless supply
6974 2018-01-06 23:38:29 You are a crypto currency away from perfection. Maybe accept Ripple for pre-orders?

6989 2018-01-06 23:37:01 It is unlikely we’re in a crypto bubble when every other person is screaming “WE’RE IN A BUBBLE!!”

More likely that the insanity will continue for quite awhile before it catches everyone off-guard right when they begin to think we’re in a “new normal.”

7002 2018-01-06 23:35:37 I'm quite bullish on crypto long term, but I feel it's like Linux in the 90s. Every year is the year of the Bitcoin desktop. Then one day the (equivalent of) Android comes along

7004 2018-01-06 23:35:18 Retail stores shutting down nationwide. Consumers using more and more cards online.  Cash will become less relevant. Crypto is the future.  $xvg $lend $trx. Crypto credit will double the market cap $bcpt

7009 2018-01-06 23:35:00 1/3 
Sometimes you see one of the biggest crypto guys with tens of thousands of followers, coming out with a tweet saying buy this coin now. and then you check the chart and see one big green candle, then nothing for hours and even days.

Welcome to crypto, this was your first lesson.
7023 2018-01-06 23:34:09 I was lucky enough to get DRGN as my very 1st buy into crypto so im glad its been a good experience for me starting out. I know a lot of others have not had the same luck.
7024 2018-01-06 23:33:57 Well deserved! A true gem in this crazy space.
7025 2018-01-06 23:33:33 @CatherineForNV I'm a resident of southern Nevada. I'm also a supporter of Crypto trading. I'm under the impression bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency. Therefore how can the IRS tax us on any Crypto? Look into this. This is an attack by wall street masked by the IRS.

7041 2018-01-06 23:32:04 Crypto currency's much touted value is in its limited issuance. The problem seems to be the potentially unlimited number of crypto currencies.........

7045 2018-01-06 23:31:45 @VentureOutlook Good day! You know that Belarus has officially approved crypto-currency ?! Also all transactions associated with bitcoin and any cryptocurrency is not taxed ? I think then you can start a great business associated with cryptocurrency !

7133 2018-01-06 23:23:55 When people say “I’ve been into crypto for 5 years” my question is “then why aren’t you retired yet?” Because i damn sure would be if i got in 5 years ago.

7135 2018-01-06 23:23:52 No, we'd likely use the pic as a dart board.
7136 2018-01-06 23:23:52 I just visited the faucet and it said insufficient funds to cashout. What kind of scam is this?
7137 2018-01-06 23:23:39 Same thing happening there unfortunately. These exchanges need to seriously sort themselves out. These delays undermine confidence, and show complete disregard for their customers.
7138 2018-01-06 23:23:38 So I have to move my LIFE tokens to a private wallet? what happens if I leave them on the exchange? Sorry, still new to crypto.
7139 2018-01-06 23:23:37 Starting to believe that the crypto markets might be in self-fulfilling prophecy mode right now. More money rushes in, everyone says bubble, even more money rushes in, bubble doesnt burst... and these insane valuations become the norm.
7140 2018-01-06 23:23:37 Bitcoiners love wasting energy... they run nodes on offshore oil rigs that they've turned into mining centres

7142 2018-01-06 23:23:32 I think by now it's obvious @CNBCFastMoney is just pushing shitcoins in a sad attempt to sabotage crypto. Especially Bitcoin. We all remember how they helped the Bcash pump backed by insider trading. But no surprise, they're part of the broken down system

7146 2018-01-06 23:23:18 So if crypto tokens are that all over again, what specifically is the infrastructure that's being built, and which will endure, upon which others will innovate?

7152 2018-01-06 23:22:52 So far my two favorite people in crypto are @SatoshiLite and @justinsuntron. I would love to see a bromance take place.
7153 2018-01-06 23:22:51 $TRX - food for thought - think of how many investors are on the sidelines waiting to register on Binance and throw money at Tron.
7154 2018-01-06 23:22:45 Seriously though, everyone in FinTwit should have a Steemit account. Posting research that the community likes earns crypto. What's not to like? I don't get paid to promote this, it's just a great idea.
7155 2018-01-06 23:22:45 @BittrexExchange in the last few days the performance of the website and API seem to be slower, everything ok over there?
7156 2018-01-06 23:22:40 Let's talk about crypto bots.
7157 2018-01-06 23:22:40 $ETH for 2018. There is so much good that ETH will bring to the crypto industry (especially for alts) that cannot be denied.
7158 2018-01-06 23:22:38 One thing I highly suggest trying (if you don’t already) when analyzing crypto currency chart data, is to implement the 4 hour timeframe . 

For me this timeframe helps display the best image of “the big picture”, much more so than the daily timeframe

7164 2018-01-06 23:21:51 I follow a lot of crypto callers, discords, telegrams that put out 90% shit calls with 10-12 picks a day and when one finally pumps are quick to say “I called that” quit wasting your time with these clowns & follow @CryptoInsiderX guy makes legit calls with info to back them

7178 2018-01-06 23:20:06 As of 2018 be aware you owe tax on every crypto exchange - even if you didn't convert to USD. Whatever you profited on BTC between when you bought it and exchanged it for ETH, you owe short term cap gains tax.
7179 2018-01-06 23:19:57 Whenever anyone tries to talk with you about crypto and begins with “I heard” immediately walk away and cease all contact.
7180 2018-01-06 23:19:56 Its going to take until January 13th for my new crypto funds to be available :(

7186 2018-01-06 23:19:37 Well, you can use a private blockchain if you’re concerned about that. Or maybe some fancy crypto on a public one.
7187 2018-01-06 23:19:33 Closed exchanges are like the $crave pump where the coins were locked up in masternodes. Only this time EVERYTHING pumps $crypto
7188 2018-01-06 23:19:28 I was just wondering what happened. I thought it was legit.
7189 2018-01-06 23:19:22 I have nothing into Crypto right now sadly. A lot of the exchanges aren't accepting new users and Coinbase is taking forever to verify me. Planned on doing some work this weekend, but just have to sit on the sidelines in the meantime shouting out my predictions. Accurate so far
7190 2018-01-06 23:19:18 I did shill $FUN a LOT since October and I hope you did follow me ! #cryptotrading
7191 2018-01-06 23:19:09 People who abbreviate cryptocurrency as crypto seriously need to stop now.
7192 2018-01-06 23:19:04 After clearing my first 10k in profit of 2018 I honestly owe my success to the Crypto Twitter Universe.. shout out @Crypto_Capo @CRYPTOBANGer @Crypto_God
7193 2018-01-06 23:18:58 hang in there man... you're an Oilers fan, you have patience 
7194 2018-01-06 23:18:57 Just saw one of @tailopez ads on #crypto, he says laszlo who sold 10000 $BTC for 2 pizzas couldn't see future trends and was stupid... smh. That was the catalyst for everything we see today. That was the first proof we had that #bitcoin would work. idk maybe we'd still be at $0.1
7195 2018-01-06 23:18:51 What about internal network tokens (not ERC-20s and not listed on exchanges).... if they are exchanged between parties to enable a crypto economy to exist on a platform, could the argument be made that the platform is a money transmitter? Seems to be lots of confusion on this too
7196 2018-01-06 23:18:45 And I’m more than happy you made that call. Among zrx my rising star today!
7197 2018-01-06 23:18:44 Call a waiter and ask him out loud: “CAN I PAY WITH CRYPTO?”
7198 2018-01-06 23:18:41 Rant: cryptos were once viewed as enabling illegal activity - “money for drug dealers.” My 10yr prediction is these connotations (and denotations) will shift from cryptos to traditional fiat, as we see the wave of decentralization and the internet of things take off #IOT #crypto
7199 2018-01-06 23:18:36 Crypto is speculative n nothin is real here. Its assumption  that someday cryptos would be used 4 real transactions (which would never happen..cant imagine countries compromising their curr). In this world, u lose trust, ppl immediately shift to 100 other available curr n ur dead
7200 2018-01-06 23:18:32 @mr10 lol. Crypto always trades on 24 hour clock/timeframe.
7201 2018-01-06 23:18:24 Dont trade your crypto

7202 2018-01-06 23:18:22 also info on where best to spot ICO’s - and the deal with paying for ICO’s - obviously differs to an exchange

7206 2018-01-06 23:18:07 Bolsa pensaba usar ING Broker. No sé qué opinas. Y la duda es para Crypto. El cierre temporal de Binance me hace dudar. Y ahí es donde hacen falta pasos.

7234 2018-01-06 23:15:52 The level of activity is probably not all that different during other boom cycles. Since it is crypto, it just feels extra absurd!

7239 2018-01-06 23:15:38 Those of us that know, know that Ubiq is one of the best crypto plays out there right now. Decentralized platform, robust community, strong mining support, outstanding wallet support, several tokens deployed, incredible dev team, and Signum.

7262 2018-01-06 23:14:02 【大まかな仮想通貨の値動き】
横ばい(1)→暴騰→暴落→
(上から続く)→横ばい(2)→暴騰→暴落→…

有望な銘柄に投資している場合、横ばい(1)と横ばい(2)を比べると、横ばい(2)の方が高いことが多い。

有望な銘柄と信じてるなら、暴落で売るのはもったいない！基本は長期ガチホで！
7263 2018-01-06 23:14:01 Market cap for crypto is over 1 trillion dollars! What The Fuck, it was 6 months ago I remember 60billion was like holy shit....now it’s just...speechless #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #dogecoin
7264 2018-01-06 23:13:59 $OAX is extremely undervalued right now. Beta comes out Q2. Now is the time to accumulate. This will 10x....possibly. But this is #crypto so there u go. #dyor

7286 2018-01-06 23:12:26 It's great to see so many of my followers researching or wanting to get into crypto, post-my initiation into the market. So, this is the thread for you. Follow along and learn something, yeah? (But keep in mind, I am not an expert. You are responsible for your own actions.)

7291 2018-01-06 23:12:00 well! it is crypto currency, just a hard to attack and very scure and fast
7292 2018-01-06 23:11:58 This mania that you see have been the case for every major technology shift in society including car, airplane, steam engine, industrial revolution, internet, and now crypto. Meaning this type of over funding is necessary to build infrastructure.
7293 2018-01-06 23:11:56 Interesting read Sherlock! Thanks mate 
7294 2018-01-06 23:11:54 Nope. I worry about the state of the crypto market past 2018 honestly. EOY 2018, if all goes well, my crystal ball says top 15. 10-15bil mcap, which would be $40-60 per coin ideally, but no less than $20 conservatively. That’s 10-30x today’s price. I think it’s doable.
7295 2018-01-06 23:11:53 Got it, thank you so much for all your help! How about denta and kin coin? I'm new to crypto and still studying how to read the charts and figuring out where is best to invest at the moment.

7298 2018-01-06 23:11:44 Hahahahahah.
7299 2018-01-06 23:11:38 Happy to see $BRD movin these past two days. Patience is v important in crypto.
7300 2018-01-06 23:11:38 I genuinely can't believe how crazy this crypto stuff has become. If all continues to go like it has been I'll be able to literally retire at 24 by the end of the year.
7301 2018-01-06 23:11:38 If you don't think crypto is a means at getting back at the olds for social security, financial enslavement, etc. you're sleeping. Wealth is redistributing, life finds a way.
7302 2018-01-06 23:11:29 Weet ik, maar ik dacht op basis van die rechter foto met die bitcoins  dat die goeroe in de crypto was gestruikeld.
7303 2018-01-06 23:11:28 So it comes down to product, marketing and the team behind it all. I hope you’re bullishness is warranted although @justinsuntron seems to know what he is doing so 
7304 2018-01-06 23:11:22 Just got them via bancor network instead. Now a proud Hodler of $kin

7309 2018-01-06 23:10:51 pointless right now since LTC market is paused. Cant do squatt
7310 2018-01-06 23:10:48 haha in crypto with 2k you can become rich, invest in things you like and hold! I am in rdd since 9 satoshi and will stay for long time in it, wait when they release RDD ID
7311 2018-01-06 23:10:45 Everybody is closing = Fresh billions coming in soon
7312 2018-01-06 23:10:40 Yeah, exchanges seriously struggling right now. That is both positive in terms of investor confidence, and incompetence in terms of exchanges providing piss poor customer satisfaction. They claim they froze new accounts to ensure service integrity of existing clients. Horse 
7313 2018-01-06 23:10:36 super bullish for kucoin
7314 2018-01-06 23:10:30 If anyone could come out with a solid #cryptocurrency exchange that had decent/fair fee's, solid coin (alts included) options that could actually HANDLE all the new peeps looking to get into #crypto ... It would be a MASSIVE success and catapult in popularity. #CryptoCraze
7315 2018-01-06 23:10:27 Concluding that #crypto profits are unlikely to bring a revolution in the way the world uses currency.

Simultaneously thinking the tech is fundamental, & that if people fancy lambos, then happy lambos.

Something more tantalising is possible, though.

7319 2018-01-06 23:10:12 I see a future crypto trader
7320 2018-01-06 23:10:10 Very well done, thanks mate
7321 2018-01-06 23:10:10 me too, always happy with profits, so many more to come over the next copule of months too. I still have 95% of my DOGE bag too, just trying to figure if all pumps are going to just test or pass last summers ATHs. So far XRP suggests the former.
7322 2018-01-06 23:10:09 Fellow Cryptonians,  for the next couple of days I'll be at the #coinagenda conference in Las Vegas representing amazing clients who are doing incredible work with blockchain. Feel free to reach out to chat and learn more in person! :)
#crypto #blockchain #ico #soliduslabs
7323 2018-01-06 23:10:08 That’s fine if you can time it right. I just know that every $BTC pump has made burst drop greatly then it recovers after a few hours. Good luck!
7324 2018-01-06 23:10:02 24h later is not a very good metric. Many trades takes weeks to play out. Depends on the call.
7325 2018-01-06 23:10:01 Who’s gonna teach the new people how to chart if all masters close the registrations?
7326 2018-01-06 23:09:57 Is there a way to filter out only coins that are available on binance with CoinMarketCap?
7327 2018-01-06 23:09:56 Simple. One or two huge coin 'insiders' or 'first in's' dump all of their coin. And the catalyst will be: CNBC and CNN report that all Crypto is insider scams and boom market crashes.
7328 2018-01-06 23:09:56 $ZRX slow grower but some seriously hodlers not selling when the market fluctuates. 0x has been good to me. 
7329 2018-01-06 23:09:56 Crypto-currencies will make me rich.
This time last year my savings were zero.
This year I have thousands and they're growing. 
7330 2018-01-06 23:09:54 #TRX は化けの皮が剥がれつつある？でも拾って信じ続ける人も多そうだな… 製品化にこぎつけていない創薬ベンチャー株を見ているようだ。 #crypto
7331 2018-01-06 23:09:48 Why is this asking for the private key? Beware everyone..
7332 2018-01-06 23:09:47 When Asia comes online, I can see $TRX, $XVG, $IOTA and $LEND all moving. Asia comprises an overwhelming amount of the #crypto market at current.
7333 2018-01-06 23:09:47 There is a lot of foolishness going on in crypto just now. Ultimately it doesn't detract from crypto itself, in the same way as the dot com bubble not invalidating the internet, but man there are is a lot of stupid money being thrown at things people don't understand just now.
7334 2018-01-06 23:09:42 Why attack @JamesGRickards if his views on crypto are dynamic?
Both gold/crypto communities have virtually the same values as regards central banking and hedging against fiat collapse.
Best of luck to everyone 
7335 2018-01-06 23:09:38 XRP will hold hostages

7356 2018-01-06 23:08:06 I'd wait for a cent or two increase then maybe reinvest a little. Still a pretty hyped crypto. Always potential
7357 2018-01-06 23:08:04 Who do you trust for good impartial #cryptocurremcy advice? Do you trust any source of information on what’s is going on in the #crypto world? I trust no one.
7358 2018-01-06 23:08:03 Woot woot my $rdd bag officially doubled! Great weekend in crypto regardless of the BTC run.
7359 2018-01-06 23:07:57 Good thing you waited ;)
7360 2018-01-06 23:07:50 balance in everything... use crypto as a tool, not the other way around. Hard goals are necessary, otherwise it's so easy to never stop. Make sure you utilize this freedom to pursue things that inspire you in life. Music, art, love, learning travel...That's how you attain freedom
7361 2018-01-06 23:07:45 Ya I saw that . Welp now the market paused on me  refresh until I pass away I guess
7362 2018-01-06 23:07:43 prob not haha. too many ppl doing it. they'd prob just block it off

7411 2018-01-06 23:04:30 I'M HODLER, I'M IN
#HODLSQUAD 1. 2. 3...  VIVA #crypto
7412 2018-01-06 23:04:27 Binance is the same. I guess this is good ?? More activity/Exposure
7413 2018-01-06 23:04:22 No ref link? 
7414 2018-01-06 23:04:14 Took me 14 hours two days ago! What is solution? Store on different exchange? Hardware wallet?
7415 2018-01-06 23:04:13 Q. Most attractive thing about the  crypto biz?
A. We already know the size of the market we're trying to apply it to.
....
It's like stepping out of a time machine.  The only thing holding you back is your hustle.
(This is my quote )
7416 2018-01-06 23:04:09 1.9 billion people in china. If tron goes mainstrea. 10 dollars for TRX us 1 trillion market cap! I think it is possible very quickly...
7417 2018-01-06 23:04:07 The funny thing about $ARDR right now is that, because of the time out at @BittrexExchange, it’s going real steady during every alt bleed session. #nobleedformethere #crypto #nxt #ignis #ardor
7418 2018-01-06 23:03:56 What do you think of Arn?
7419 2018-01-06 23:03:52 I'm really curious, why is it the best in your opinion? It usually took me more than 30 minutes to successfully login, and when I got tired of it and decided to withdraw all my funds it took me numerous hours, every evening for 4 days in a row.
7420 2018-01-06 23:03:49 You know you've made it in crypto Twitter when you get 5+ "explain please" comments or post @BigCheds
7421 2018-01-06 23:03:48 haha so you are also getting into the pump&dump schemes. So much for crypto hating, greed has beaten you too lol
7422 2018-01-06 23:03:44 This is basically how I feel about it. Like yeah if you don't pay attention you'll be mad but it's a crazy good idea to make some rake. Also, it's hip and people love crypto.
7423 2018-01-06 23:03:39 We just very excited as to where we have taken Neutron from a year ago.. it’s something we are proud of and have really been working very hard to achieve where we are today. And there still is a lot more exciting things to come. I would like to invite you to join our discord 
7424 2018-01-06 23:03:35 Lol once again the banks aren’t going anywhere. It’s insane that the CEO of shapeshift actually believes that crypto will replace banks.  boggles my mind how naive people are.
7425 2018-01-06 23:03:34 
7426 2018-01-06 23:03:33 do we post a screenshot and an address or just wait?
7427 2018-01-06 23:03:26 Can we expect something???
7428 2018-01-06 23:03:22 Too much traffic!
7429 2018-01-06 23:03:16 Does anyone not think it’s a bit curious and somewhat concerning that these exchanges are halting new registrations which means they are essentially locking the door to paying  customers with money (crypto) in hand?   What successful businesses do that?
7430 2018-01-06 23:03:08 It's not bad until your shilling an ICO whose paper you haven't read, unless you're trying to troll noobs, in which case it's not bad for your purposes lol
7431 2018-01-06 23:03:07 Crazy shit..where are all these ppl gunna go 
7432 2018-01-06 23:03:04 Exactly gotta love the cons of crypto

7436 2018-01-06 23:02:47 1k es una buena inversión inicial. De todas formas, cuando te registres haz un ingreso pequeño de unos 50-100e para hacerte con el #exchange ver como operar, confirmar transacciones y eso. Ya después, metes el resto. y de ahí, #tothemoon 
7437 2018-01-06 23:02:37 What market did you use to get into DNT since it’s not listed on binance?
7438 2018-01-06 23:02:32 Hey man I’m hoping I am wrong! What price do you see it going to yourself?
7439 2018-01-06 23:02:08 Friend: Hey, I want to get started in $crypto, can you recommend me some exchanges to trade #altcoins?

You: Yeah, use Bittre- I mean Binanc- I mean cryptop- fuck. Guess you could always use Poloniex?
7440 2018-01-06 23:02:07 やっぱりみんな一発当ててやろうって思ってるんだろうね～。
草コインの伸びが異常。早く仕込んだ者勝ちだけどさ・・・。

7457 2018-01-06 23:01:10 kucoin is a pure crypto exchange. you have to deposit some crypto on it first before you can trade. no debit or credit card can be issued here.

7466 2018-01-06 23:00:30 Nothing just seems unprofessional to shill your own coin like that
7467 2018-01-06 23:00:24 one of the biggest fails in crypto history. B3 holders hodl and convert with loss while the new buyers could get it even cheaper today. #scam #b3coin i am done with this bs coin

7476 2018-01-06 22:59:56 Yeah that’s what I thought. So a massive coin burn is necessary before anyone can even start thinking about anything over $5.

I’d be happy with 20 cents atm
7477 2018-01-06 22:59:49 Your assumption is that another trillion or 2 dollars wouldn't enter blockchain tech. You are enormously wrong: he has a vision of 10 billion people using his platform. Open your eyes...

7491 2018-01-06 22:59:02 Thoughts on SNM??
7492 2018-01-06 22:58:59 Crypto currencies are not defined by their utility but by their community.

We should therefore start measuring them as such.
7493 2018-01-06 22:58:58 Dadi is the best example to say, everything is just hype, even with the top dogs

7508 2018-01-06 22:58:03 Because of the new US Tax codes on crypto... you would be foolish to take any gains on anything if your investment is less than one year... your taxes will be approx 35-40 percent..... but if you wait until after a year down to about 15 percent... plus it give time for $trx :)
7509 2018-01-06 22:58:00 $TRX going for a little run here. #crypto #cryptocurrency

7526 2018-01-06 22:57:06 So what do the $MANA crypto fam think $MANA is going to do next, very stable at this level currently.
7527 2018-01-06 22:57:06 Pay attention during 2018 to crypto currencies. There could be major disruption for the banking industry.
7528 2018-01-06 22:56:57 I think they could. Really great team over there. But we might not find out if brokerages can't also trade crypto bc of SEC rules or whatnot.

7569 2018-01-06 22:54:18 Market cap= circulating supply x price
So trx will never go to 100 usd or something. But with big partnerships is 1 usd in 2018 possible. And thats still a huge growth

7571 2018-01-06 22:54:07 i think someone dmed their twitter account and got a reply suggesting two weeks from now

7573 2018-01-06 22:54:05 Thanks so much!
7574 2018-01-06 22:54:00 Look into $ICX too mate, and also I’m intrigued by $FUN
7575 2018-01-06 22:54:00 Only thing actually holding back $storm from further gains is the POS HitBTC
7576 2018-01-06 22:53:56 Wonder if Axe starts a new Crypto trading desk in this season 
7577 2018-01-06 22:53:54 #crypto world never sleeps lol
7578 2018-01-06 22:53:50 なるほど〜
ありがとうございまーす。

フォロワー見たけど、女性かどうかはネカマの判断つかないし、分かんないやー。

7579 2018-01-06 22:53:48 Why not use crypto to get some booty since it's the only thing ya got goin for ya.
7580 2018-01-06 22:53:47 $xvg $trx So many new buyers trying to make a quick buck pouring into crypto made the exchanges halt new registrations.  Crypto credit is going to be massive $BCPT.X $bcpt @blockmasonio
7581 2018-01-06 22:53:41 $20 in June easily
7582 2018-01-06 22:53:39 Let’s see the results, I have always been curious if someone was tracking my calls
7583 2018-01-06 22:53:35 Theres a few of us here. One person announces they just did a buy and nobody else wants to miss out so we basically all have the same anyway
7584 2018-01-06 22:53:34 Thank you ! But I can't desposit eth on this exchange.. what crypto did you use To buy ?
7585 2018-01-06 22:53:28 Hahaha..  Good luck bro

7589 2018-01-06 22:53:12 #crypto is going to be just fine.
7590 2018-01-06 22:53:11 Woah don’t misunderstand you should defo have diversification but I meant if you wanted to get more $VEN still at good price compared where it will go.
7591 2018-01-06 22:53:08 #crypto zzzz's now when i wake i want at least 2 bags, thank you and good night

7593 2018-01-06 22:53:00 I use it to inject more money into the system or cash out. ie: I buy Litecoin, and put it in my Exodus wallet then I can trade from there. Never leave crypto online. I'm not one for tautologies but online crypto is a no-no.
7594 2018-01-06 22:52:59 To tell you the truth I would be more concerned about the constant shilling without charts. Ref links abound
7595 2018-01-06 22:52:44 これって分裂とかではなくて技術的なアップデートだと思っていました(っ˘꒳˘c)

7602 2018-01-06 22:52:00 1/ Modesty becomes you, my dear traders. You encouraged The Bull to #DYOR and so it was done. First, The Bull had to know whether Twitter was another pump and dump or an arena for the display of skill and, thus, monitored what happened 24h after a call was made.
7603 2018-01-06 22:51:58 Easiest way to tell if someone’s shilling (should be blocked) or debating (should be listened to); personal attacks. Crypto is trustless, it’s irrelevant who built it.

$BTC $LTC $ETH #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #crypto
7604 2018-01-06 22:51:56 I know your busy, but where could I learn about the analysis you do on the charts? What's "trends test" ?
7605 2018-01-06 22:51:44 You're too right. Diversification is overrated. No project I believe in more than $VEN right now.
7606 2018-01-06 22:51:36 We cannot comment on exchanges as a matter of policy.
7607 2018-01-06 22:51:33 But fundamentally, doesn’t the fact that there is a much larger supply of something make it less valuable?

I’m holding #trx #tron $trx myself so I’m genuinely not trying to be difficult
7608 2018-01-06 22:51:23 That would be a great game
7609 2018-01-06 22:51:23 Wohooo!!! Finished selling most of my $XDN at 11x. Only 10% #moonbag remaining.
 
Just occurred to me. I don't know what #DigitaNote is all about, except it was a low-sat high-pump coin. Will research about it to see how valuable it is holding long term. $Crypto

7614 2018-01-06 22:50:57 I’ve gone 4x on my BTC investment since I came back to crypto September, but I don’t think I can handle large amounts of money in positions full time.
7615 2018-01-06 22:50:51 @MercatoxCom  How do I transfer coin to your exchange?
7616 2018-01-06 22:50:45 Brazzers are a crypto currency
7617 2018-01-06 22:50:41 I think that is a great idea. I know dick squat about crypto but listen You've done well on this one,

7628 2018-01-06 22:50:18 I've got #crypto tied up on #coinsmarkets as well. What, is cryptoteller think he's being singled out and all a conspiracy? harhar. we humans have tendency to think all events are centered upon us.
7629 2018-01-06 22:50:14 Lmmfaoooo!!! What a name for a crypto currency lol ... I think only Bobs family is buying into ICO
7630 2018-01-06 22:50:11 people are selling binance accounts. she wasn't hacked lol

7642 2018-01-06 22:49:35 Lots of opportunities in crypto every day. I think it will drop again- it's already come down a bit. These dividend coins are really popular right now, but the pump today seemed a little bit over the top based on current volumes.
7643 2018-01-06 22:49:34 Just play poker with crypto.

7655 2018-01-06 22:48:19 @AlmBank ICO will add on #Icoalert very soon. #AlmBank #ICO Project launching on Dec 28th, it's a Crypto Job market and self-funding Charity. Give them a look when you have time!

7657 2018-01-06 22:48:10 Well they never guaranteed bch or btg but I don't think there is a reason they wouldn't be able to support IGNIS
7658 2018-01-06 22:48:09 Everything must have a trade off. We gain freedom from the need for banks thru crypto, taking control ourselves. The gain in freedom from middlemen comes with having to protect your own money, yourself.
7659 2018-01-06 22:48:07 How much you have now?
7660 2018-01-06 22:47:56 Thinking like what can I sell in my house to buy more $crypto... 
7661 2018-01-06 22:47:56 Thanks. I just found it on binance as well.
7662 2018-01-06 22:47:30 I’m quite happy with my profits with $DOGE. reentered yesterday at 67 sats. Still holding. Woukdnt be surprise if it hit last top at >150 sats on big exchanges too.
7663 2018-01-06 22:47:26 Word on the street is if you put all your eggs in one basket, bought high, sold low, tear martinis from you whiners taste extra good. Most of us bough below $0.10 so we sipping champagne.
7664 2018-01-06 22:47:26 All of the CS courses I’ve done in Java so far.   The Math class (Crypto) we used Python.  I’m very undecided.
7665 2018-01-06 22:47:26 And TA. Just basics really!
7666 2018-01-06 22:47:25 The love isn't just because of Disney being mentioned. 
Its a great product that enables other projects to launch easier. The market is adjusting it towards its rightful place in the top 10.
7667 2018-01-06 22:47:23 Buy some fucking books and sports gear with your #crypto profits. Improve your body, upgrade your mind!
7668 2018-01-06 22:47:22 @crypto_rand why haven’t you mentioned $NEBL it’s about to pump again 
7669 2018-01-06 22:47:20 Hacked* ffs
7670 2018-01-06 22:47:17 Also, in cases where you just don't know what's happening or what to do (which I fully understand), just go away. Checking your coins every 5 minutes doesn't improve your way of trading and doesn't improve your ability to make good trades. Take time off. There's more than crypto.
7671 2018-01-06 22:47:13 Crypto twitter would sell their family for referral money.
7672 2018-01-06 22:47:11 Agree.

7675 2018-01-06 22:47:02 It's on kucoin and etherdelta, but etherdelta was hack a week or so ago, so beware. Also, seriously research the coin. It's not rising by accident.
7676 2018-01-06 22:47:02 Im ok to pay tax on withdrawal to fiat even thou its fraud and robbery, oh well, but to tax on trades within crypto and then to tax again on withdrawals to fiat, c'mon.

7689 2018-01-06 22:46:21 I can't see any crypto going mainstream until the currency fluctuation is stopped. No good for business. Whoever issues a crypto with a fixed value will kill it.

7706 2018-01-06 22:45:41 Hi crypto kitty, could you look into #SAFEX and share your thoughts on the coin.  Currently delisted from all major exchanges but soon  to go on next exchange. Thank you
7707 2018-01-06 22:45:39 maybe #StrongHands?  if not, let me know :)
7708 2018-01-06 22:45:35 I highly doubt that. If implemented in the way it is supposed to be, there is nothing that can stand up to $XVG. It would simply become the de facto crypto. Just imagine what total privacy can bring in. $PIVX is much much slower than $XVG

7723 2018-01-06 22:44:20 I don't know. With Crypto Currency coming up, we are relying less and less on the banking system for anything. Why pay you guys to get 5% gains when we can do it ourselves for free and get 200%+? #CryptoCurrency #Decentralized

7730 2018-01-06 22:43:48 狭き登竜門になりすぎてる！！
7731 2018-01-06 22:43:43 Really finding it difficult understanding the whole crypto currency thing
7732 2018-01-06 22:43:39 Really enjoying my attempts to analyze charts on @tradingview

7733 2018-01-06 22:43:38 You guys think BitWallet is a good place to store my Dragons?? Got some more yesterday on KuCoin and need to transfer them
7734 2018-01-06 22:43:26 It is "Irrational Exuberance" -- unsustainable crypto investor enthusiasm that is driving these "new" asset prices up to levels that aren't supported by fundamentals -- a bloodbath will arrive -- the strong will survive.
7735 2018-01-06 22:43:20 @PIVX Being a newbie and learning crypto from the bottom up, has been more than rewarding by following this account and joining the community @discordapp. And eeeek, I now own $PIVX!!  #keepitpurplepeople
7736 2018-01-06 22:43:15 for all my friends considering or currently investing in crypto-currency...

please be careful.  

your hard earned money will look really good as it goes up, but like anything else, there will be tumbles. don’t invest what you can’t stand to lose! ...
7737 2018-01-06 22:43:15 You should watermark. Great work deserves great respect!!
7738 2018-01-06 22:43:14 When people ask me what I am doing for a living, I am answering, “gains”.
What an awesome time to be alive.

7742 2018-01-06 22:43:08 Bitcoin will be the icon of crypto currency...we might have better currencies...but I believe BTC will be store of value in the crypto world

7753 2018-01-06 22:42:11 The crypto market going stupid!!!
7754 2018-01-06 22:42:09 Sarah you are a Gem. Was trying to open acount with Binance. Link works. #sharing is caring.

7758 2018-01-06 22:41:53 Yep agreed. That statement about no guarantee is making twitter crazy with FUD now. They have been linked in hundreds of threads like this...I've started using KuCoin recently and they are gonna be getting more of my biz. Don't mind F up's but zero communication to customers sux
7759 2018-01-06 22:41:48 You're still giving too much credit for majority of crypto, 90% of the new crypto community make 05 Poker button clickers look like pros
7760 2018-01-06 22:41:47 Why #Facebook partenering if they can make there own crypto
7761 2018-01-06 22:41:45

Good luck with your #trx

7762 2018-01-06 22:41:43 3/3 Crypto Tip #4: Don’t chase pumped coins. There are so many good coins out there. If you missed one, then look for another one.

Crypto Tip #5: Don’t over trade. Over trading    Could cause you more stress
7763 2018-01-06 22:41:37 Mijn crypto van de week is toch wel de SIA Coin, check vooral even de whitepaper en koop een beetje in. #cryptocurrency #hodl #tothemoon
7764 2018-01-06 22:41:37 Oui mais ce n'est pas le même niveau d'intensité. C'est comme de dire, rouler en jeep ok ça pollue mais marché à pied également (production des chaussures que vous portez...)
7765 2018-01-06 22:41:37 Where did you buy $kin ?
7766 2018-01-06 22:41:18 Lost Wallet is a big Issue! Lose a Crypto wallet could be a MAJOR Issue :)
7767 2018-01-06 22:41:14 2/3 Crypto Tip #3: If you decide to sell your coin, do some research first to see if there is any  event that could increase the coin value. This is a very expensive lesson for me.  I sold my $ZCL  ~$4.30 and after a week the price shoot up to $80
7768 2018-01-06 22:41:10 I think i need to join cryptopia... too sick of seeing gems on there I can't access. Which on of my followers has a ref link they want to shill me? ;) I'm happy to use it. #Crypto #bitcoin
7769 2018-01-06 22:41:08 LOL since @XVGWhale  hopped ship  @VergeAddict pops out of nowhere. Pretty sad what you're doing @vergecurrency and I hope the law catches up with everyone involved in this scheme, bad name for crypto. #fuckxvg #xvg #verge #Vergecurrency #VergeCoin

7773 2018-01-06 22:40:47 Quick question are you using hitbtc?
7774 2018-01-06 22:40:43 On crypto or just shopping?
7775 2018-01-06 22:40:41 @Thornz2000 did you receive wild crypto  email on the 2nd? If so what was it
7776 2018-01-06 22:40:38 1/3 Crypto Tip #1: Always your own research before investing.

Crypto Tip #2: Avoid buying $hitcoins so you have nothing to worry when the market is down.
7777 2018-01-06 22:40:36 Can't wait to troll this guy for a month straight when banks go live with xrp lol
7778 2018-01-06 22:40:21 That's more realistic!
7779 2018-01-06 22:40:20 I'm sorry about shilling $DADI yesterday - really thought it was a nice, legit ICO for once. Guess I was wrong.

(I still think it will do nice, it's crypto after all, but i'm not buying it anymore myself)

7788 2018-01-06 22:39:41 cryptopia only? I’ll pass)

7790 2018-01-06 22:39:35 Morgen komt ie weer online. De Blocker $crypto week kalender, met daarop de belangrijkste #cryptocurrency evenementen van de komende week! Welk event mag hierop absoluut niet ontbreken volgens jou...?
7791 2018-01-06 22:39:27 Stay safe in this crypto streets, you can make a ton of money, or get rocked.. I hope you avoid the later
7792 2018-01-06 22:39:24 I cannot offer financial advice. I am simply a camp counselor.
7793 2018-01-06 22:39:22 Crypto fan boys
7794 2018-01-06 22:39:04 最大手数料（0.0198072 BTC）のときのBitcoin Transactionをみると，inputが10個で，outputが1個でした。しかしそのサイズは16421bytesで，148∗10+34∗1+10=1524bytesよりずっと大きい。
7795 2018-01-06 22:38:57 Will $BTC moon soon?  

We think $BTC will stay in the $17,000 range while altcoins continue to pump, at least over the next week. $BTC will certainly rise above $20,000 in the near future as the crypto market gains more institutional adoption. Don’t get caught in the FOMO!
7796 2018-01-06 22:38:56 @KIN_KING_CRYPTO Been researching my next hodl and KIN seems one of the most promising, however I'm concerned about the extremely high supply, what are your thoughts on it?
7797 2018-01-06 22:38:54 To be clear:

Am I saying you shouldn’t invest in crypto? No.
Am I saying you can’t get value out of this? No. Some of the biggest gains can be made by selling something on a bubble at the right time.
Am I saying it isn’t a real currency? It technically is even if it behaves more

7803 2018-01-06 22:38:42 Best place to trade crypto with lowest fees, now that binance isn't accepting any new sign ups for the time being?
7804 2018-01-06 22:38:29 No. I’m talking about the rapper Nas. He’s finalizing his NASA certifications and is going to the moon. He will be live-streaming it so that we can all feel like we are going with him.
7805 2018-01-06 22:38:26 @aantonop  what’s your thoughts on nations developing their own centralised crypto currencies for example petro Venezuela and Russia
7806 2018-01-06 22:38:22 Is it a short or long term? As I'm new to the world of crypto

7811 2018-01-06 22:37:59 They don't imply that at all, they say it is airdropped on the first and then after that they specifically say we will need time to make sure we can incorporate proper wallets for IGNIS, they also said specifically we don't guarantee anybody is getting IGNIS
7812 2018-01-06 22:37:58 The price of coss will be up 200% and back down by the time my deposit actually shows up on their jank beta.
7813 2018-01-06 22:37:56 You can google info on crypto currencies and make educated decisions. This guy has no info, he just guesses..don't pay him!

7816 2018-01-06 22:37:29 The McAfee Formula for getting rich:

1. Pick a random crypto
2. Invest heavily
3. Tweet some bull$hit about it - "oh hey guys, heard about this new Home Repairs coin?" 
4. Wait for the pump, preempt the dump

Honestly, how do you sleep at night? I hope you're donating to charity

7841 2018-01-06 22:35:46 What about the Crypto Channel?
7842 2018-01-06 22:35:34 Dude - that statement is from 20th December and though not direct, alludes to us having our #IGNIS on 1st Jan. I don't and from Twitter threads I am not alone. I can find no more up to date official statement from @BittrexExchange though happy to be corrected if I missed it...
7843 2018-01-06 22:35:28 Give me some, this stuff has to be amazing
7844 2018-01-06 22:35:28 Deadal Nix, I was so depressed in the 1st half of 2017.  You brought Bitcoin back from the brink of destruction.

Soon the entire World will use crypto-currency as money. 

BitcoinCash for the win! 
7845 2018-01-06 22:35:21 The ease of being able to just grab your phone and check your crypto is the reason why we have drastic changes in price. People are effected by #FOMO quickly, and #FUD quickly. It's also the reason why so many will have a gut punching feeling in 2 days when it's 3000. #trx #TRON
7846 2018-01-06 22:35:16 just loaded up on some more. This is going to the moon! cant wait for it to to be on coinmarketcap.
7847 2018-01-06 22:35:12 I see. I seemed to have read something wrong on it a few days ago. I'll keep an eye on it. Is it on @binance_2017 ?
7848 2018-01-06 22:34:54 Good points. Not sure why there's a celebratory tone to this. If you want managed risks there are well established mkts for you to earn the standard servantile returns. In a free mkt, crypto, there is plenty to like and not like. Choose where you fit in. To them it's ALL a scam
7849 2018-01-06 22:34:52 i'm liking xdn as well seems a year of the crypto's that start with X's. i,e. XRP, XLM, XBY , XRB, XMY, and others slaying it.

7878 2018-01-06 22:32:47 I’m not an expert but if you literally have no idea what you’re talking about when it comes to crypto then why be negative towards it & want it to fail? BTC back up to + 17K so where’s the hate & negativity now?
7879 2018-01-06 22:32:41 Now that $DRGN has broken $4, it's funny to think back on the 1,500 $DRGN's I've given away at various times. That's $6k today!

Makes me wonder what all the "baller" OG crypto guys have done & what they've given. You know, the ones constantly shilling ref links... 
7880 2018-01-06 22:32:21 That’s a social engineering scheme if I ever saw one. Lmao
7881 2018-01-06 22:32:17 @TimDraper  Good day! You know that Belarus has officially approved crypto-currency ?! Also all transactions associated with bitcoin and any cryptocurrency is not taxed ? I think then you can start a great business associated with cryptocurrency !
7882 2018-01-06 22:32:15 Just buy that place
7883 2018-01-06 22:32:08 @JayChizza I don't think this Crypto coin and sneaker channel together is gonna work. It is drawing away people who could care less about weird online currencies and like sneakers. It is just not good for a channel idea being different isn't always good.
7884 2018-01-06 22:31:54 #BTC Update
BTC Again at 17K Dollars Level Trying To Break That Resistance
If Breaks Then Next Target Would be 17960-18100 Dollars

Alts Won't Dump That Much now as BTC Dominance is Still at 36.4% at the Moment
7885 2018-01-06 22:31:51 the best way to make verge successful is adding a feature where if you are holding the currency for 6 months it will generate another unique crypto currency. Of course it's already making difference with #wraithprotocal . However this idea is to increase the value of verge.
7886 2018-01-06 22:31:50 Crypto Notes so far: Crypto is the Delorean, and Blockchain,  the flux capacitor. 
7887 2018-01-06 22:31:49 1000枚＝25億見えてきそうで怖い
7888 2018-01-06 22:31:30 Yes I've been lightly researching about him, things are triggering my spidey sense about this coin so I'll keep watch and suggest caution to others. Early adopters can take the risk. Good luck! hopefully you do very well with your investment decision with tron. 
7889 2018-01-06 22:31:27 What's the best crypto to buy for a small but long term investment in your opinion? Just trying to have some fun while studying for my exams :)
7890 2018-01-06 22:31:23 People flexing their crypto currency 
7891 2018-01-06 22:31:16 Im literally the opposite of this. I cringe spending $8 at taco bell. But $10k in crypto? Duh
7892 2018-01-06 22:31:08 リッラーに負けるな！いけーーー！
7893 2018-01-06 22:30:52 Another intense day in #crypto. Bought some $POWR and $KCS today. #altcoins. Alot of greens today. Chilling with a whiskey at the moment. $NEO $BTC $LTC
7894 2018-01-06 22:30:42 I've tried to block their ads multiple times and it works for a short period, then they just redirect it and it's useless
7895 2018-01-06 22:30:35 did i really type 'thinks' instead of 'things'....bloody autocorrect function....
7896 2018-01-06 22:30:30 It’s working now

7900 2018-01-06 22:30:19 Got into a crypto/block chain convo with some dude at the gym today and was not aware of any of the things I was talking about. Know what you're investing in dude.
7901 2018-01-06 22:30:18 Omg hasn’t moved killing me
7902 2018-01-06 22:30:14 LMFAO. u monster SHHHHHHHHHHHHH
7903 2018-01-06 22:30:10 Am I wrong in thinking it’s impossible for trx to get anywhere near btc due to the huge amount of trx units in circulation?

7905 2018-01-06 22:29:49 @NathanBoucaud What are you using to buy your crypto? Coinbase doesn't have enough.
7906 2018-01-06 22:29:44 The founders and early adopters all make out better than the rest... And more crypto currencies are coming online daily.  Who is to say which will succeed? All perception at this point...
7907 2018-01-06 22:29:35 wait for real estate/stock crash then invest in it ? :D I'm planning to do that when I get the chance but now is not the time imo
7908 2018-01-06 22:29:32 王目覚めそう
7909 2018-01-06 22:29:28 I believe so too, but I want to hear it from the master
7910 2018-01-06 22:29:23 Midnight .... so it's true ... crypto never sleeps . I'm just curious so I know what time I need to be awake over here to catch all the news and be part of the conversation in real time .

7911 2018-01-06 22:29:18 You need to look at GLD It's sneaking up on people!
7912 2018-01-06 22:29:16 Thank you sir, been playing the trading game since 2005, with the S&P500. Decided to get in the Crypto trading game early spring 2017. 

Been a nice ride!!
7913 2018-01-06 22:29:12 I have been to Korea. An absolute great country, great food and very techy. And... they like their own products, not Apple, but Samsung, not Volkswagen but Hyundai, not GM but KIA. And they will also embrace their first and only ICO for a blockchain... $ICX
7914 2018-01-06 22:29:00 Good god people, they are trying to upgrade the site and you are all shitting on them. Give em a chance for fucks sake. The amount of people influxes to crypto over the passed few months has been ridiculous. No one predicted it. There isn’t a site that hasn’t experienced issues!
7915 2018-01-06 22:28:55 at least they know to incorporate in DE  for no state tax
7916 2018-01-06 22:28:54 When I first learned options I remember the natural gas options traders "I don't know what an Mmbtu is and I don't care" essentially they traded vol and didn't care what the underlying actually was. In many ways that's what is going on with #Crypto and various trading strategies
7917 2018-01-06 22:28:50 I can confirm doing it 1. then 2. then 3 is the hardest way but also worth it.
7918 2018-01-06 22:28:37 People need to stop looking at the coin supply...this is the crypto world!
7919 2018-01-06 22:28:34 #Crypto update:

2 waves to hit #crypto in 2018 faster than most think..

1) #Institutional #Capital
2) #Regulation

(circular reference?)
7920 2018-01-06 22:28:19 I had stop loss at 700 and 660 on mine. Watching closely. Expecting we will see support around 580. I’m a newbie learning so don’t take this as advice.
7921 2018-01-06 22:28:19 this is by far the most active I ever was on a social media platform..can't help it though, crypto excites me too much
7922 2018-01-06 22:28:19 Yeah I #dmor.  Was just engaging in a conversation. If you had enough time to smugly reply twice you could've instead elaborated.  But you do you, "crypto maniac". 
7923 2018-01-06 22:27:56 Sir wabi when moon
7924 2018-01-06 22:27:54 I actually don't give advice on crypto. You can ask @ryan_hildreth.
7925 2018-01-06 22:27:52 Was a great stream. Thank you @CryptoGat for the time and energy you put into this crypto game! I hope you know there is an army of people full of gratitude rooting for you to succeed every moment of every day. I am one of those people. 
7926 2018-01-06 22:27:48 my goal for 2018:  Free myself from the system and then take as many as I can with me. $BTC #bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #freedom
7927 2018-01-06 22:27:46 100 JPY(BTC): 1304.776 ~ 1306.748 KRW(BTC)
7928 2018-01-06 22:27:40 Don't deal with this scam site @cosscrypto . They are taking deposits but won't give out withdrawals. They are costing people too much money. Avoid this #Coss like the plague. It's getting close to the time $coss should be reported to the proper authorities. Where is our money?
7929 2018-01-06 22:27:38 Did someone say Lambo? You’re really committed to this new crypto gig.
7930 2018-01-06 22:27:33 Not that I’ve seen so far
7931 2018-01-06 22:27:30 $cssi Costas Inc has 100% ownership in a #cryptocurrency exchange that launches in less than 20 days. Plus 300 crypto atm's in casinos across latin america. Just hired new COO with alot of experience. These guys only go big #crypto #bitcoin #btc #ltc #xvg #trx #xrp
7932 2018-01-06 22:27:29 Before you enter any trade think of the time frame of it and what target you are setting. "What do I want to achieve?"
7933 2018-01-06 22:27:24 Good point. I'm interested in how a country without a currency (or rather a trustworthy currency) could be helped with crypto. My point was that cryptocurrencies won't replace the dollar, yen etc.
7934 2018-01-06 22:27:23 its never too late
7935 2018-01-06 22:27:02 I believe you're wrong, unless you can assure that this is the high and tomorrow it isn't doubled in value!
7936 2018-01-06 22:26:59 I haven't heard of even half of the top 100 coins on coinmarketcap wtf
7937 2018-01-06 22:26:43 Me too.  Got in a great position on $STRAT on the last dip.
7938 2018-01-06 22:26:23 True, hubris is not good. Was tough to lose last year. However, still some "big" trader accounts posting trades where they had losses...
7939 2018-01-06 22:26:18 @clif_high Thanks for mentionning Electroneum in your BNW report.  Took a gamble and made 400% on investment.  Looks like wallet is launched and they have signed a deal with XIUS a leader in the mobile and payments space.  Easy and great way to get newbs into crypto!
7940 2018-01-06 22:26:17 There it goes...!?
7941 2018-01-06 22:25:55 1000 sats just a matter of time
7942 2018-01-06 22:25:50 Like sensei says, come back monday. Thinks can only get better, woehoehoehoe, thinks can only get better. Doesn't matter if its wrong or wright, we could slowly disappear in the night.... :)
7943 2018-01-06 22:25:46 You should check out crypto port, I used to use Blockfolio but had issues sometimes. Cryptoport is, in Mt opinion, better. 
7944 2018-01-06 22:25:46 0.01c? it's at 0.05 now and climbing. and $6 is low crypto markets are exploding and billions more invested daily ! and they're working on more adoption into online and retail sales, plus working on integrating segwit. plus the $XMY transfer fee's are very very cheap 0.0002.
7945 2018-01-06 22:25:39 يبشرك بالجنة
7946 2018-01-06 22:25:34 30$ minimum
7947 2018-01-06 22:25:29 Crypto day traders! Remember, that you don't have to make 10000% gains on every trade. Technically, if you make 1% on every trade, someday you won't ever have to work again!
7948 2018-01-06 22:25:27 あっ、もしご存知なら教えて欲しいのですがフォークコインの貰い方ですが.THCをビットレのウォレットに入れてるだけで大丈夫なんでしょうか？
7949 2018-01-06 22:25:26 Possibly iota will drop if you look at the charts to as low as $3 first . But this is crypto guys and who actually knows! One day can feel like a month. #Electroneum will make its way to the top 15 area in the months following
7950 2018-01-06 22:25:24 Same question realy, will Topia support airdrop?
7951 2018-01-06 22:25:14 Dude that $20 by the end of Q1

7958 2018-01-06 22:24:21 Is it true that $salt only offers crypto and $LEND offers crypto and fiat loans??
7959 2018-01-06 22:24:21 Not a house bought with crypto, just renting atm, I don’t know where exactly I want to permanently live yet so no need to buy a place outright, haha. Also not the best person to speak to about UK tax since it confuses me too. Local accountants are your best bet.
7960 2018-01-06 22:24:20 just relax guys, it is always like that. Its the crypto boom these guys are drowning in work and thats good.
7961 2018-01-06 22:24:11 What makes you say that @CryptoMo1105
7962 2018-01-06 22:24:09 When you're at a gathering and you pretend to use the restroom to check crypto twitter and Blockfolio. #blockfolio 
7963 2018-01-06 22:24:05 Please do, I'm just getting into crypto and would be curious about it
7964 2018-01-06 22:23:58 Um, how overvalued is the crypto currency market? Anyone interested in some Dutch tulip bulbs?
7965 2018-01-06 22:23:54 but yesterday you were shit talking TRX okay
7966 2018-01-06 22:23:50 There are def. however, it’s so hard to find good ones! Shoot out to me if you found one, can help with a 2nd opinion perhaps.
7967 2018-01-06 22:23:44 
7968 2018-01-06 22:23:42 The next Crypto Currency will be called #Schilling.

7973 2018-01-06 22:23:21 hey i thought you r horse
7974 2018-01-06 22:23:20 What makes you say that?
7975 2018-01-06 22:23:20 $Trx 
7976 2018-01-06 22:23:19 there is a company behind it and has a strong team which includes Vitalik as an advisor.  But the purpose of crypto is to be decentralized.
7977 2018-01-06 22:23:09 Man... even Bob Dylan is getting in on the crypto game!!
7978 2018-01-06 22:23:05 ^ this guy knows what’s up
7979 2018-01-06 22:23:03 Amazing that $RDD coin is climbing against $BTC, even as $BTC continues to rise. Plus, volume is relatively low, all of which makes me think that #Reddcoin could explode if more people were aware of it. #Cyrptocurrency #crypto #gains
7980 2018-01-06 22:23:00 Your wcw thinks Venmo is a crypto currency
7981 2018-01-06 22:22:46 @crypto_rand still feel the same way after the whole somn thing? They still seem game changing legit to me

7983 2018-01-06 22:22:27 I started crypto like this in 2011
7984 2018-01-06 22:22:05 If you follow me there is a ~90% chance I will look at your profile and consider following back. I've noticed that the percentage of people who just started following me who don't have crypto terms in their bio has gone from ~10% in November to ~50% now
7985 2018-01-06 22:22:01 It is going to be “Picture Fork” :)
7986 2018-01-06 22:22:00 I started right before China FUD with $10,000 and I’m on my way to $1million with just my own intuition and research 
7987 2018-01-06 22:21:44 $BTC running again, potentially wrecking all the set-ups
7988 2018-01-06 22:21:41 
7989 2018-01-06 22:21:35 Assets or liabilities? :) From what I get crypto has no real assets but promises a lot of profits (liabilities)

7993 2018-01-06 22:21:21 back to 0$?
7994 2018-01-06 22:21:17 Hey - where can we buy $can? Thanks in advance for your help!
7995 2018-01-06 22:21:08 Great i think it's take away to me  thanks sarah
7996 2018-01-06 22:21:01 I am hoping Alts will go down at the same speed so I can buy :)
7997 2018-01-06 22:20:59 Be careful with choosing Crypto Exchanges... Some rip you off @hitbtc #HitBTC charges you at deposit, again at trade then finally huge at withdrawal #cryptocurrency
7998 2018-01-06 22:20:58 Where do I sign?
7999 2018-01-06 22:20:57 What do you use to buy a vampire?   A crypto currency.
8000 2018-01-06 22:20:55 Should be fine!
8001 2018-01-06 22:20:44 Let me rephrase... Crypto needs the music industry, though the music industry can’t stop Crypto from freeing artists from the industry.
8002 2018-01-06 22:20:38 do you think we should sell burst?
8003 2018-01-06 22:20:31 1 month ago
8004 2018-01-06 22:20:26 @BigCheds mind checking out the @BQX 1 hr chart? I like what I see.
8005 2018-01-06 22:20:03 She’s not “into crypto” she’s into “get rich quick” schemes. In an earlier era, she’d be hooked into some MLM scam.

8022 2018-01-06 22:19:09 Jordan, help me read these crypto currency charts and let’s recreate history!
8023 2018-01-06 22:19:07 They didn't squash it lol... They made it open source, then a few of the devs left Disney to found the dragonchain foundation. Disney isn't running the show, but they still support them. Far from "squashed it".
8024 2018-01-06 22:19:04 Is it doctor's diagnosis?
8025 2018-01-06 22:18:56 What does it mean to pump a crypto 
8026 2018-01-06 22:18:55 I think the definition of #HODL applies to not just resisting the urge to SELL at the first sign of trouble, but resisting the temptation to BUY when a #shitcoin pump has everyone going crazy. HODL your nerves, people! #Crypto #altcoins #alts #PumpAndDump #cryptocurrency
8027 2018-01-06 22:18:53 2/ This tactic applies very well in more stable steady growth instruments. IMO a crypto trader at this point should remain mindful of compounding, but use strong FA to find fewer, higher return trades. Remember the interest rate is in the base of the exponent

8034 2018-01-06 22:18:18 Crypto-assets represent the first product, not the final innovation. It looks like we have begun to see the spread of economic freedom. Only time can tell though
8035 2018-01-06 22:18:17 Just hype
8036 2018-01-06 22:18:17 A bit, yea..... I'm sure there are many more than us lingering about the crypto-sphere. Good to know man.

8073 2018-01-06 22:16:18 Hi there, We support over 50 digital tokens, with the crypto world constantly evolving & growing we have to take coins down from time to time for maintenance. We are doing some work behind the scenes to make sure the coins allow for successful exchanges in the future.
8074 2018-01-06 22:16:07 It's a huge revolution banks can trade crypto via hyperledger to instantly move money across the world. Currently this takes them 3-4 days using the swift network. Banks will set up own cryptos & use XRP as a medium between banks. Banks will own nodes they can trust.

8085 2018-01-06 22:15:26 All #btc is, is a holding place for people buying and selling alt coins,  once coins like ripple can be transferred to cash or other coins without the involvement of #btc or any of the other major crypto, c ya #btc

8093 2018-01-06 22:15:13 I am working with a team that needs to pay $50.000,- transaction costs to send out a free Airdrop of ERC20 tokens. I think this is not the intention of Blockchain/Crypto. This is crazy
8094 2018-01-06 22:15:08 hahaha, yesterday I was thinking "good thing I am selling $DOGE at 100+ sats" - now, not so much.. buuut, hindsight is always 20/20..

8108 2018-01-06 22:14:13 It really is blowing my mind how man people say they "trade" crypto
8109 2018-01-06 22:14:13 Yes, but picking the "dip" in BCash requires speculation that it will once again be artificially pegged to a high price soon. I am not betting on Ver's bank balance. He might do it but there are other more profitable and decent projects out there for me to back.
Good luck though.

8112 2018-01-06 22:14:05 The rules I stick to when trading Crypto.
1) Enter a trade with an exit plan.
2) Always have a stop loss in place
3) Learn from your trading mistakes
4) Don’t FOMO Buy
5) Understand total market cap 
6) Look for upside potential
7) Understand tech behind the asset

8186 2018-01-06 22:07:34 oops, sorry. Should have checked. You have a good point regardless, the Tron foundation is obviously fully invested in growing his company, especially by having an office in SF.

8197 2018-01-06 22:06:46 Lol, what can I say... I read some good research/charts at the beginning of the week. In ETH at 894, LTC at 236, and a smidge of BTC. One of those (esp ETH & BTC) very well could be the Amazon of crypto one day. I'm willing to ride the coaster to find out who.
8198 2018-01-06 22:06:42 The question should be "when they gonna wake up? ". The balloon might not pump again as last week..

8205 2018-01-06 22:06:24 Favorite recent conspiracy is that Ripple will devalue their primary asset to help the banks capture the "real" cryptos. All these "investors" who have a thousand bucks or so in crypto have really been cracking me up lately. love your articles btw - Psykotixx
8206 2018-01-06 22:06:20 They just announced an partnership with some book company today. They also have a grocery chain and hospital as partnerships. They will only go up

8214 2018-01-06 22:06:02 You don't have to like XRP but a trade is a trade and even the crypto OG's are getting emotional over it. Keep in mind 30% of the price action is coming from people buying it with South Korean Won. Not trading BTC for it. They're planning to HODL.

8237 2018-01-06 22:04:17 As it is a good argument to say that the most money is in people who don’t understand btc but can understand ripple, that’s not going to further adoption. I like the argument of utility which is one that has serious weight. Which is why the OG pushback is so real.

8257 2018-01-06 22:02:18 when $XMY @myriadcoin reaches the same current market value of $10,033,437,165 $TRX Tron has at moment the price of each $XMY will be $6.25 each ! That's a fact and I easily see $XMY hitting that market cap this year as crypto grows in popularity ! 
8258 2018-01-06 22:02:17 Only the agilest fund managers will be able to generate performance in such volatile crypto markets and #swissborg aim to stay in this club. For instance, we closed this short position on December 23 at USD 13,082, making a 34% profit in a week.

8263 2018-01-06 22:01:44 As I posted earlier, some guy developed an audience, posted a big post, got over $4000 in payouts (not all available for immediate withdrawal but a large percentage that he could either transfer into favourite crypto or cash out through Coinbase). That is extreme but possible.

8295 2018-01-06 21:59:13 Isnit over valued? Yes. Will it be brought down to it's true value? Depends on whether it keeps getting pumped by Ver and invested in by people who know little about what they are backing.
Besides, crypto total market cap is rising fast.
Shorting terrible ideas is a terrible idea
8296 2018-01-06 21:59:12 To have an organisation like ripple in the crypto world, who aren't scared to show their face, fight for their coin and support the people who believe in them is just something that I've never witnessed before. They make themselves accessible to their coin holders. Just amazing

8306 2018-01-06 21:58:14 When first getting into crypto, I was all about fundamentals because TA was voodoo to me. 

I've spent months in the space researching, trying to understand more & more. TA is still voodoo, but I'm figuring out how to read the chicken bones.

8317 2018-01-06 21:57:23 Is that crypto?
8318 2018-01-06 21:57:19 なのでどれも問題があるとは思うんだけど。とはいえ、どういう通貨システムをつくるべきなのか、ということを学習し、研究でき、日本円はじめFiat全体について考え直すことができる。そういう意味でCrypto Currencyを持つって行為は意義深いよね。知的好奇心がくすぐられる。

8329 2018-01-06 21:56:30 The crypto market is about to hit a trillion dollar market cap and could go well past that in the upcoming months or even weeks.  Most of the money is now pouring into a lot of the undervalued alts and bitcoin.  I would personally avoid the larger caps atm.  #crypto #bitcoin
8330 2018-01-06 21:56:29 What exchange? I tried via etherdelta but transaction failed twice to load some ether there to make purchase

8332 2018-01-06 21:56:25 I see a lot of tweets about how wild the current volatility of the crypto currency market is, and how it's going to "crash" because it has no backing value.
It kinda makes me feel like people are failing to see the forest, for the trees.
8333 2018-01-06 21:56:15 @eTheRealMcAfee  would love to have you on our show sometime, crypto never sleeps live, lets talk some crypto.

8345 2018-01-06 21:55:32 In PoS people tend to not sell as much, true, as in POW miners usually don't care much about hodl & sell most coins they mine to profit with no emotion. (as they have running cost to pay for)
but i disagree that this leads in POS to low supply on trading market --> price high.
8346 2018-01-06 21:55:31 Hmmm. Cevap verirler en sonunda diye düşünüyorum. Moralini yüksek tut.

8443 2018-01-06 21:48:02 Yes, but when you have 1 other crypto specifically gaining ground then it's telling.

Market dilution is a real thing. But it should affect all top Cryptos equally. So she BTC is losing but other Cryptos around it are gaining then something isn't right. BTC lost its use case.

8447 2018-01-06 21:47:44 I was thinking a similar thing earlier in context of the whole "real bitcoin" debate. People are looking for authorities to tell them what to follow which is what we are used to in life. Crypto might actually be the first time this can potentially be different.

8453 2018-01-06 21:47:20 GAS/BTC 1.5 Month High - Gas (GAS) price reaches 1.5 Month High - $GAS $BTC #gas #finance #crypto
8454 2018-01-06 21:47:18 Absolutely correct, return is what counts. I'm not sure what to make of it all. Some of the returns that have been stated are mind blowing. I have exposure but are not actively trading crypto's. Interesting to see how it evolves.
8455 2018-01-06 21:46:49 Check ticket #71123 please!! Almost a month old! I would appreciate it so much, thank you!
8456 2018-01-06 21:46:43 I think, that many #people forgett the #risk of #quantum #computers. I really #looking #forward to that #future, but you need to be aware, in real live and especially in #crypto, how #quantum #computers will change our reality. #Blockchains for example, won’t be useful anymore.
8457 2018-01-06 21:46:42 This Crypto stuff is funny. Everyone wants to be an analyst. Do your homework/research before buying in.
8458 2018-01-06 21:46:38 Agreed. Crypto is obviously different than traditional stocks, where that would be a flashing signal, but I was in at $10 so why risk it 
8459 2018-01-06 21:46:35 Hocam ben kesin olacak şeyleri yaziyorum. Şu coin iner çıkar sormayın lütfen. Çıksa da umrumda değil zaten. 10 katına mi çıkacak sanki. X10 altı coinlere çok takılmiyorum.
8460 2018-01-06 21:46:26 wake up kid, Cardano will be the first $trillion doallr crypto!!!! it will surpass both ripple and BTC...of course it will rise well beyond $15 and that's for 2018
8461 2018-01-06 21:46:12 Great conversation. And there is absolutely no way we move to electrify the world using robots, batteries, crypto, etc. without the efficiency of nuclear. This time Uranium is going up and and a new floor will be established.
8462 2018-01-06 21:46:08 Thanks for your help brotha. I appreciate it. You are the fucking man.
8463 2018-01-06 21:46:01 I agree Matt there are a lot of technical pro traders that broadcast on YouTube.

Your style and your content is special and add a lot of values for us Crypto traders in many different ways then conventional trader way.

Keep up the good work

8467 2018-01-06 21:45:45 There's a lot of good crypto coins, the reality is it wouldn't make sense for the average consumer to have 100+ different currencies to choose from to pay for their coffee. The coins that are doing something different than the others are the coins that will survive. #crypto
8468 2018-01-06 21:45:36 Expect a big fucking price evaluation my guess.
8469 2018-01-06 21:45:31 Gold is awesome first you need money to get gold and anyone who isn’t taking advantage of crypto is missing a chance to 10x their gold and silver and weapons
8470 2018-01-06 21:45:22 There is no such plan. We've made it clear in a press release last November. But if someone would like to run a few trillions crypto transactions over @WeiTekTsai blockchains protocole we can meet for coffee & talk about it. We are fairly open. :)
8471 2018-01-06 21:45:21 If you are into investing and do your due diligence home work, then you are in right place with cryptosrus. If you are into gambling there are other places in digital universe. 
George is an outstanding educator in crypto investing. He is definitely earning his tittle Dr George!
8472 2018-01-06 21:45:08 It might also be the case that there are actually really no clusters of crypto communities as decentralization has made possible contributions from individuals from all parts of the world! (eg. the Ethereum dev. team hadn't met before officially launching ethereum iirc) (2/2)

8478 2018-01-06 21:44:47 Good for everyone. XRP wouldn't soar during a bubble burst. That said if someone is not heaviest on XRP (in regards to long term holding), I strongly believe they are either doing their crypto portfolio a huge disservice or just an anti bank BTC anarchist type.

8494 2018-01-06 21:43:36 Ive been watching pink for a litte while now. I think 1,000 sats would be an easy run and that will be a minimum target to capture some profit and ill let the rest ride the wave past that. With the ATH being around 3,000 sats I think we have plenty of room.

8505 2018-01-06 21:42:43 Really relate to this post. Went all in ETH during the China FUD and lost 50% of my stack. Then when I discovered alts I lost the remaining 50% to a PnD. Never gave up though, and those guys you mentioned were saviors. @CryptoZyzz especially in my case.

8537 2018-01-06 21:39:58 I'm not against crypto, I trade it. However, to say crypto currency has already taken over fiat currency is categorically false. Saying differently is delusional.
8538 2018-01-06 21:39:57 So balls deep in it man !!
8539 2018-01-06 21:39:56 meant 'sure they will'

8601 2018-01-06 21:34:49 On the AIM if a share has moved 100% you've missed the boat; the Crypto equivalent would be 1000%. Lot's of fun in looking way outside the top 100 and probably closer to top 500 for the big movers.

8624 2018-01-06 21:32:40 In theory it should mean the price goes down but these crypto gremlins are still pumping the price higher and higher for some reason. probably because they are fucking mongs.
8625 2018-01-06 21:32:39 How much is left 
8626 2018-01-06 21:32:26 I still have one concern with PoS. Everybody wanting to stake creates low supply, raising the prices of the token artificially.

8631 2018-01-06 21:32:03 Cómo se "fabrica" una nueva Crypto? Quien lo hace?
8632 2018-01-06 21:31:50 most people buying are not doing any deep analysis. This is the new wave of crypto in which newcomers just buy because is cheaper/hyped with complete disregard to market cap..no logic needed,.forget 2017 crypto. Small position and just playing the 24h high upside. stop loss set.
8633 2018-01-06 21:31:49 Of
8634 2018-01-06 21:31:45 Had several trades where just bought ETH, then bought the alt I want. HODL BTC, just don’t bother to trade it.
8635 2018-01-06 21:31:39 Congrats! When did you start, and what return have you had since following them?
8636 2018-01-06 21:31:37 An average day at @CNBC Crypto Edition.
$XRP Rises 10x in two weeks: "Natural Growth/Future of Money/BUY NOW".  
$BCH Goes 8x in a week: "The Real Bitcoin/Totally Natural Growth/ BUY”.
$BTC up 10% intraday during a bull market for two + years: "Ponzi Scheme/SCAM/ STAY AWAY".
8637 2018-01-06 21:31:32 I am a hodler if SUB.  Already up 140%
8638 2018-01-06 21:31:22 We have a very strong presence in Guatemala too.
8639 2018-01-06 21:31:18 I invested in crypto like 3 years ago & I’m still learning about it. I was interested in the tech not investing (currency vs commodity, not HODL)
8640 2018-01-06 21:31:13 Was never in any doubt. This is a good team with great adoption strategy.
8641 2018-01-06 21:31:11 IDK, I have to say I sold my LTC on Coinbase (double in a week ) and they transferred the funds into my bank account the very same day. I was very surprised given all the bitching I see in these threads. Out now, don’t trust crypto to hold value.
8642 2018-01-06 21:31:06 If you’re using @CNBC for your $crypto news, sell all your coins and go back to your fucking mutual fund.

8659 2018-01-06 21:29:56 I would recommend you find an accountant to answer that. The style of LLC will depend on what you expect to earn on income and if there are partners etc. There are negatives to not falling within those boundaries of whichever one you set up

8662 2018-01-06 21:29:43 I agree, for now total cap keep increasing. When BTC hit 20K the speed of 1K rise came to few hours. Same may happen to total Market Cap. 100B rise few hours? May be.
8663 2018-01-06 21:29:42 Thanks all. Seems like I thought this was vastly undervalued. Now with a circulating supply of 622M, it seems to suggest this is being valued like all other crypto...
8664 2018-01-06 21:29:41 Just threw some $$$ on $ukg.  This coin is going to skyrocket once it hits the Korean exchanges....plus all the @SharkTankABC viewers will jump on it thanks to @mcuban

8688 2018-01-06 21:27:47 So on one side there is an insane amount of truth to this. On the other side, we are in the first quarter of a long game. I believe focus is valuable, and will determine the winners in the crypto world long term. No one has “won” or “missed” yet.
8689 2018-01-06 21:27:44 Given that market caps are a notoriously unreliable metric, is there any estimate of how much fiat has actually crossed over into crypto?
8690 2018-01-06 21:27:40 What is there to debate. You answered your own question when you said they have a working product. Most coins do not yet.
8691 2018-01-06 21:27:36 If I did that last year I'd be a millionaire right now, because crypto is retarded.

8705 2018-01-06 21:26:02 You need skin in the game to code crypto optimally.

8747 2018-01-06 21:22:56 Anyone doing crypto here?
8748 2018-01-06 21:22:55 Invest only after getting all the rite knowledge in Crypto world! See YouTube videos, read articles get knowledge, share it and grow as a community. And live a life which you always dreamt....
8749 2018-01-06 21:22:50 Bald is beautiful, just do it, women always ask you if they can rub your head or, on special occasions even lick your head.  Yes, I've been asked.  Do it, you will love it ;)
8750 2018-01-06 21:22:49 Cool, and now invest in $pac warren:

8754 2018-01-06 21:22:33 Same situation, man, I feel for ya!
8755 2018-01-06 21:22:31 What is Gems ?
8756 2018-01-06 21:22:30 Exactly, long term bag
8757 2018-01-06 21:22:27 Problem is you pay a lot of compound taxes on stuff. A car can sometimes cost 2~3 times its price just because of taxes, so that "low" interest on income is an illusion
8758 2018-01-06 21:22:17 I agree with about 80% of your post. Check out DCR. I think it's a sleeper and well be around long term.

8763 2018-01-06 21:22:10 i was able to convinced my gf to support me in crypto when i explained to her that each coin has its technology to offer..she was just amazed she thought it was just for payments like bitcoin.
8764 2018-01-06 21:22:10 TAGERT will be the new HODL !
8765 2018-01-06 21:22:09 Congrats Ed! Well deserved!
8766 2018-01-06 21:22:07 Others real exchange like Bittrex and Binance take no longer then 20 min to complete my withdraw. Mercatox is a scam exchange that’s why it takes longer than usual or that just an excuse!!! I should’ve google it before I got scam! It’s all over google that this exchange is a scam

8776 2018-01-06 21:20:41 I was in the process of creating an LLC and was curios if I should do it online or just drop it off at the office. Say I was making an LLC for developing an app, can I use that same LLC to write off crypto gains? Or do I need 2?

8779 2018-01-06 21:20:39 The banks? One of the major things crypto offers is an alternative to the centralized banks. When Ben Bernanke talks about a cryptocurrency it's time to get f out of dodge.

8784 2018-01-06 21:19:52 Is the term 'crypto' useful? If I were to play along: is crypto's market cap the best way to measure its relevance?
8785 2018-01-06 21:19:49 crypto has destroyed the idea that there wasn’t and isn’t “cash on the sidelines.” So many noisy surveys.
8786 2018-01-06 21:19:46 I've been sitting on it since .04 also waiting on the ride. #TRX
8787 2018-01-06 21:19:43 Their last tweet was yesterday stating there would be a news release about LTC and DOGE trading. So far they haven't said anything and I see way too many people freaking out. Good majority of them being new to this scene. Crypto is a community but recently it isn't acting as one.
8788 2018-01-06 21:19:39 If you haven’t jumped on @nebulasio $NAS check it! Amazing team including $NEO founder Hitters Xu and developers from Google, IBM and Airbnb, also it has not hit any major exchanges yet . .

8789 2018-01-06 21:19:36 FAke news bro.
8790 2018-01-06 21:19:36 Idk. I don't go around screaming scam coin to every #cryptocurrency I see on the market. It's not my thing. I don't spread FUD. I just stated a simple fact that I thought was rather odd. I hope every #crypto invester becomes very wealthy one day. Even if it's not one of my picks.
8791 2018-01-06 21:19:28 Any good crypto related place to earn some interest on USD? Heard Bitfinex has it but it's probably Tethers.
8792 2018-01-06 21:19:20 Lol, I got out before the bullrun, but I needed $$ to get into $ICX and $WAN, and you know what? Best decision ever!
8793 2018-01-06 21:19:19 Cryptocurrencies exist and are increasing in value because elements of the populace don't trust fractional reserve banking and governments.  With crypto you don't have to trust the counterparty. Everybody can plainly see if the other guy has the goods or not.
8794 2018-01-06 21:19:10 I started $Crypto with $10,000 USD. I lost 50% in the first few days due to #China #FUD. I got scared, lost even more. I was lucky to bump into people like @Crypto_Brahma @JewKorean @CryptoGat who gave me the tools to find #Gem's. Thank you guys. I owe my #wealth to you.
8795 2018-01-06 21:19:06 Social gas/fuel/block pseudo rewards from FOMO, FUD, TLDR, Shills, Parabolas, Mooning and the like are both a blessing and an absolute disaster in the crux of #Bitcoinhistory

Self and external spewing a bit like water to the crypto sea.
8796 2018-01-06 21:18:54 You can transfer #trx to #hitbtc, in Monday will be next great point, now is time to buy and #hodl I cannot wait for Monday :D
8797 2018-01-06 21:18:50 I love $Buzz for the similar reasons with $THC. Devs are fast and smart to catch the needs of investors and address them properly. I’m sure both devs can run successful businesses outside the crypto world cuz they just have what it takes to make their business successful.
8798 2018-01-06 21:18:49 Bobby are you looking at Wanchain and if so do you have any idea of what the price could be once it hits exchanges?
8799 2018-01-06 21:18:46 I am not one for bashing coins, but why are you in crypto supporting XRP? Crypto is about decentralization, not about putting your trust in banks again.

8806 2018-01-06 21:18:08 That's why I avoid btc whenever I can. When ripple used to be stagnant, I preferred ripple. I've also used verge to move funds.
8807 2018-01-06 21:18:06 @ryan_hildreth Hi Ryan. Thanks a lot for your youtube training that you have been offering. I live in Kenya and I feel that this is the right time to invest in crypto. I was wondering if you know where I can borrow $2500 to start my crypto investments.
8808 2018-01-06 21:18:06 A main selling point is that they actually have a product. Unlike most coins that just have an idea still. Was it the most polished release? No. I’d rather them work on the tech than the brochures though.

8817 2018-01-06 21:17:19 No it is over. Don’t buy a pump and dump coin. Sun sold a lot of $TRX as well. Move away and find the next coin to be pumped before the pump. It can make you rich. Don’t get fucked by wannabe crypto guru saying shits

8877 2018-01-06 21:11:07 Definitely. I have watched the #crypto discussion from the irc days to forums/chats and crypto twitter change from supporting projects for what they are and their team to simply pumping coins. New money is not taking the time to learn why a coin has value. Its a shame.

8901 2018-01-06 21:09:10 Because we are too lazy to read and can’t do math is the only reason for our economic woes regardless political affiliation. Crypto craze on social media and YouTube is a prime example.
8902 2018-01-06 21:09:01 Tons of value in the community surrounding the WSP blog as well. I made 2 month's rent by following one crypto tip left by a commenter.

8908 2018-01-06 21:08:22 This is how it works with stocks, now they're doing it with cryptocurrency. "Price of fame." Of course, there's rules against this sort of thing with stocks (idk re. crypto since it's "quasi-regulated"), but naturally there's also very large loopholes to those rules. Corruption.
8909 2018-01-06 21:08:19 Someone needs to call in a welfare check on ol McpumpAFee. He is in a room somewhere with a pc and 3 kilos of coke. That or hes being held hostage by a gang of mad crypto kitties

8913 2018-01-06 21:07:54 Crypto enthusiasts constantly spreading FUD about any and all Cryptos, don’t listen. DYOR. The same personality types spread FUD about $BTC early on and look at it now.  $TRX $ETN $LTC $PIVX $DGB $NEO $XRP
8914 2018-01-06 21:07:54 It’s not a bubble. Crypto is simply the future and it reacts to simple supply and demand economics. Adoption expands and contracts, but growth overall continues to trends up and to the right. I call that the healthy growth of a new and potentially very crucial asset class
8915 2018-01-06 21:07:51 I like this clean a lot as well but in wondering what the massive hype online is all about

8935 2018-01-06 21:05:48 The CryptoCrush article is the reason for the move higher (maybe insiders are buying because they know what is coming).  Adding EVX to their portfolio shows confidence in the team.  Plus, the Everex team already has two very popular products in heavy use by the crypto world.

Oh god.
8952 2018-01-06 21:03:57 I have been thinking the same thing. What’s different is that global banks aren’t exposed to crypto and so the “systemic risk” is much lower. On the other hand, the common man may have more at risk!

8959 2018-01-06 21:03:26 IMO it’s important practical crypto investors have a larger % BTC base instead of larger % alt coins base.  Remember most of these alt coins aren’t being used in production and you must assume their value could go to 0.

8981 2018-01-06 21:01:31 It's because it's true. Everything crypto has become sexy and idealistic because there's lots of money involved and it's full of starry-eyed idealists.

8998 2018-01-06 21:00:11 If you are investing in a coin because of hype you should also not be investing in it. We are all here to make money and you should invest because you see potential in the tech which drives price. #trx is approx 150% up when I tweeted people should look at it even at current drop

9003 2018-01-06 20:59:53 @naval The value stored in a stable fiat $ system is human productivity.  Currency creation is limited by actual value creation.  If no such link exist in crypto, what “value” is it storing?
9004 2018-01-06 20:59:50 $100 bills are like the crypto currency of college because the value is real but you can’t spend them anywhere
9005 2018-01-06 20:59:42 And you talk about TRX every single day since it's bump. It seems like you are salty, that you didn't buy in low and cash out high. Technically all of Crypto is a scam. Because the original concept is that it's just to make transactions faster.

9023 2018-01-06 20:58:02 $ETC everything you love about #ethereum with none of the @VitalikButerin
9024 2018-01-06 20:57:56 To be fair, it IS Google and it knows what you're into.
9025 2018-01-06 20:57:54 To clarify 1st December 2017 you could buy $TRX for around 0.005. If you spent $1500 that would be worth around 130000 this week 
9026 2018-01-06 20:57:48 Haha no worries man! You’re spoken highly of in my crypto WhatsApp group do you have anymore strong shouts for infant coins atm?

9030 2018-01-06 20:57:30 A pity to see a lot of great projects with development and frequent commits; shadowed by smoke and mirror projects with a Wordpress or wix website trying to implement blockchain when they haven't mastered web design of 90s $crypto

9032 2018-01-06 20:57:18 Welke setup gebruik je en kan je een proof of concept van je setup laten zien? Welke crypto's mine je? Ik hoor van alle kanten dat mining eigenlijk nauwelijks nog rendabel is, maar ben best benieuwd als dit klopt :)

9035 2018-01-06 20:57:05 Goed gedaan, great insight into the market. Good follow!
9036 2018-01-06 20:56:55 Crypto 
9037 2018-01-06 20:56:51 Let's talk about how people are buying #PacCoin by the millions and it doesn't even have the white papers available  (if it even exist) for the public. #crypto #xrp #xlm #trx #ada #xvg and that is the only coin bashing I will do 
9038 2018-01-06 20:56:49 Ripple (xrp) is the more logical and technologically advance crypto. It should surpass most coins.
9039 2018-01-06 20:56:47 when i traded $XRP for other coins, i had three times the amount of coins than when i first bought it. i don't like their ceo. i think he talks to much trash about genuine crypto-currencies. why hodl a scam coin when can hodl solid crypto-currencies ??
9040 2018-01-06 20:56:26 Newcomers are bashing as its go down a bit, which means they’re short $$$ But In reality it is still up 
9041 2018-01-06 20:56:20 I never put money in crypto that I need xD
9042 2018-01-06 20:56:16 Unifyの同期進まねぇぇぇぇぇ
9043 2018-01-06 20:56:16 Is it time to buy then (still learning) I’m a fucking twat at this.
9044 2018-01-06 20:56:13 Been following you since you started your IG and just added you on here. Def one of the most transparent crypto traders out there. 
9045 2018-01-06 20:56:12 We see that so often with the Asian markets eh and that is with many of the Crypto's
9046 2018-01-06 20:56:06 2 things I love dearly:

9055 2018-01-06 20:55:35 Up too you. If you invested late to the game and need the money then that’s your call. If it’s money which you can live without then definitely #HODL
9056 2018-01-06 20:55:19 I believe if you don't have some money in Bytecoin (BCN) you're going to miss a major bull run here within the next day or two. Get some on Cryptonator or Poloniex.

9058 2018-01-06 20:55:04 Wow, too bad you don't have the asset of being modest and letting your work speak for itself. Good on you all glorious one!
9059 2018-01-06 20:54:55 Something tells me to take $TRX profits and throw into $ICX. What do you think crypto peeps? I have a feeling $ICX will light a roman candle this month.
9060 2018-01-06 20:54:51 Exactly, wouldn’t mind a little more to get us back to my original accumulation level

9068 2018-01-06 20:54:09 One of the main supporters was still bragging on his Twitter yesterday about his earnings. I asked if he'd checked his mailbox yet. I'm still waiting for a reply. #heprobablybusy

9080 2018-01-06 20:53:00 I think xrp was establishment coin to control the market. Banksters pulled this heist and noobs and greedy traders were the fuel to rocket the prices. Xrp will control the price of other crypto assets for months( if not years) to come.
9081 2018-01-06 20:52:58 See you on the other side crypto brother
9082 2018-01-06 20:52:48 I’m just starting with the crypto stuff this week and feeling lost. It’s very frustrating for sure!
9083 2018-01-06 20:52:40 but...but...but but 100% daily return. They promised!
9084 2018-01-06 20:52:32 BTC I still looking strong! Hourly RSI looks nice around 58. With a strong MACD cross it should push through 17000. Let’s see if some of these walls come down in the coming hours. #Crypto #btc #BullsandBears #altcoins #HODLSQUAD #cryptocurrency
9085 2018-01-06 20:52:26 If Syptec Krypto is any indication, it's server colos that will be selling the shovels to the crypto gold miners. Invest in colo companies if you have institutional money.
9086 2018-01-06 20:52:11 Invest at your own risk. When you are a millionaire, you suddenly have hundreds of cousins.
9087 2018-01-06 20:52:05 Fud = Buy. You dont see fud on coins that don't have a future.

9103 2018-01-06 20:50:06 If anyone would like to learn about crypto currency and start trading it in 2018 just hmu don’t be shy. I’m on a mission to show as many people that I possibly can how to become successful w/ cryptocurrency. There will be a lot of “cryptonaires” at the end of 2018, don’t sleep!

9112 2018-01-06 20:49:09 I can not tell you how good of a buying oppourtunity this is right now for many of the smaller altcoins. Why buy during the rush? People always want to ride the wave instead of waiting for the wave. #BuyNow #cryptocurrency #Altcoins #xvg #trx #poe #Crypto

9120 2018-01-06 20:48:16 Those same investment bankers worship the ground of the Peter Thiels and Mark Zuckerbergs, etc. Why? Because they see them as pioneers and never want to miss out on the next wave of tech investments. The crypto market cap is no accident, and it's not growing because of teens.

9124 2018-01-06 20:48:09 Good question  but if you take a look at total supply & what’s in circulation I think we’re a way off from that I’m sure 
9125 2018-01-06 20:48:05 I probably don't have to ask but is it r/crypto again?
9126 2018-01-06 20:48:02 Well crypto works on the fact of buy the rumour, sell the news. Let’s not hate the players; let’s hate the game! $ETC #ETC @coinbase
9127 2018-01-06 20:47:54 Oddly enough, I can attribute the majority of my $crypto timeline to #pokerblackfriday April 15th, 2011... Definitely not alone in that. Very few people are worse off if they transitioned their focus to trading right then and there.. Maybe next life for the most of us :p
9128 2018-01-06 20:47:52 Djises.....ETC... is a slow dying coin with no real user and network base.
9129 2018-01-06 20:47:51 This is literally the best time to be alive to make money quickly if you know what you're doing. This is insane, and yet people still bashing on it. Unbelievable.

9141 2018-01-06 20:46:42 Took 19 hours for them to move mine @coinbase to @binance_2017 wasn't speed the whole idea of crypto? Oh yeah and fees..gotta have fees
9142 2018-01-06 20:46:37 Yahu pumpla dumpla olmuyor işte. Anlık coin vermiyor. Orta vadeli diyor. 2 gün önce @altcoinrookie nin verdiği coin bugün %70 artıyor. Bunun dumpla ne alakası var???
9143 2018-01-06 20:46:35 Thanks for sharing your opinion! It's clear there are a lot of people like you hating on Ripple and a lot of people with a completely different viewpoint that think it will succeed. 2018 will certainly be an interesting year.
9144 2018-01-06 20:46:31 Disagree. All millionaires and billionaires have been buying crypto specially btc.

9156 2018-01-06 20:45:32 @joelcomm you should have Mike on your podcast to talk about Crypto tax law!

9176 2018-01-06 20:44:11 Burada kriptonun grafiğini okuyan birçok kişi var. Aynı coin ismini vermeleri kadar doğal birşey yok. Ama size dump yaptırdı. Kendi ucuzdan aldı falan demeniz yanlış. Herkesin aklı var kime neye inanmak isterse inanır. Çamur atmaya gerek yok. Herkese saygı..
9177 2018-01-06 20:44:10 The thing is no government on planet saw crypto as a serious offender but now it's getting their attention since it can cripple their broken system. So my theory is that they all have been accumulating crypto specially in 2017 onward.
9178 2018-01-06 20:44:08 @rumcajs_cz Hi i came across your website masternodes, i am new to crypto and have been investing in coins and ico which seems to be straight forward. I never knew you can make money this way.

You will be able to use the coin to invest in funds they are offering too, seems like they are using some quant strategies and then it looks like they could be offering a crypto fund too so it could be an easy way to invest in a portfolio of cryptos

9188 2018-01-06 20:42:52 Yes. Your statement:  "Gov't only cares about what you buy and sell for in USD." Is very misleading. You will technically be responsible for keeping track of ALL crypto buys and sells in their USD valuation.
9189 2018-01-06 20:42:51 Everybody knew crypto currency was doubtful and many scholars have deemed it haraam. There is no space left for your logics but obviously jin ne invest kara wo tw bolengey hi :’)

9206 2018-01-06 20:42:00 DOGE had solved the scaling issues that bitcoin has today(slow confirmations/high fee), but it didn't have the right branding. $XVG carried the torch, with a much more advanced #crypto platform than #dogecoin, or #bitcoin. (#verge was NOT a fork of #DOGE, as n00bs often believe).
9207 2018-01-06 20:41:57 They can read the chart. Trying to speed it up
9208 2018-01-06 20:41:56 The only worry I’ve got on $fdX is that there were repercussions after they weren’t able to raise sufficient funds. In crypto time that shouldn’t affect us much because they’re definitely holding enough coin to make it worth keeping ppl engaged.

9212 2018-01-06 20:41:46 $BTC has 3.5x less supply than $LTC
$LTC undervalued or $BTC overvalued?

9214 2018-01-06 20:41:44 Follow @NicholasMerten on YouTube #Datadash for great technical analysis on crypto currencies. It’s great to know that people spend a lot of time researching these coins rather than just throw money into an investment. Keep up the great work.
9215 2018-01-06 20:41:38 Thank you, can more people spread the word that $PAC is just a pump coin???  How can everyone be a millionaire on this coin if everyone wants to cash out when their stash finally reaches that value? Unless they deliver something amazing. I don't see it. Plenty of other options.

Had to stop thinking about it in Dec as I was going overboard at one point.

To make matters worse, the missus has now become keen on crypto. But that is more coz she is shilled on BTC XRP success stories on FB

9249 2018-01-06 20:38:03 How? Could you give a brief, concise explanation? I’m diving into crypto and my current, albeit basic, understanding of traditional financial instruments leaves me puzzled at the foundation of crypto. That said, society is moving towards digitization so it’s value is obvious.

9254 2018-01-06 20:37:39 FanDuel hoping Bitcoin is at $50k when they pay out to make that "value".  But if people aren't willing to look deeper into these contests, should they really even be allowed in the crypto market.

9268 2018-01-06 20:36:55 So why support xrp now? It only prolongs the possibility of using crypto without fiat?
9269 2018-01-06 20:36:49 Most brokers will do it, but may need a phone call, likely you are looking at £50 dealing costs with  most regardless of size but small issue if the #crypto market maintains this momentum. #KR1

9273 2018-01-06 20:36:10 Yes great catchup, community beats individuals in crypto.
9274 2018-01-06 20:36:05 Agree. Pivots happen in startups and the capital is trapped so most investors can't or don't claw their money back. With #Crypto assuming there is liquidity better to GTFO.

Pump konusunda sürekli uyarıları var. Orta vadeli coin hemen almayın diyor. Lütfen gerçektr görünen şeyleri çarpıtmayalım++
9281 2018-01-06 20:35:40 Justin, the fact they #KR1 can get in large in the ICOs is also a massive advantage, kind of gives us expert #crypto exposure well managed without the headaches.  

The record since IPO has also been outstanding.

30P this month and if the market continues £1 in 2018 target

Is Crypto Currency the new talk of the day 

Fill me in here 
9291 2018-01-06 20:34:15 And I have confidence in the technology and purpose of xvg so the FUD is also irrelevant. It's not all about the money. If you truly understand what xrp is, then you don't understand the purpose of real crypto.
9292 2018-01-06 20:34:14 If so, it seems like a great project. But according to my calculations it would be $3.04 per token?

9309 2018-01-06 20:32:31 So many Brazilians are now suddenly crypto advisors on some FB groups here. I've read things like: "Buy raiDblocks and keep it" / "Buy one coin" / "msg me inbox" lol
9310 2018-01-06 20:32:25 Hopefully FB will adapt Tron as their crypto platform...
9311 2018-01-06 20:32:21 @RiNox88 thanks for the follow. What kind of crypto empire? I'm doin the same.
9312 2018-01-06 20:32:20 They just don't understand mainstream adoption of blockchain tech brings the masses who are still scared of crypto or don't understand it. When the masses get it, the moon is true

9322 2018-01-06 20:31:47 that is a very reasonable reply... not
9323 2018-01-06 20:31:44 It has ONE hundred billion coins, not plural hundreds. And market cap is irrelevant to crypto just as it is irrelevant to real estate and fiat currencies.

9377 2018-01-06 20:27:01 I've skimmed the barterdex whitepaper. It seems to be *far* less efficient, requiring numerous on-chain transactions. Whereas Lightning swaps require zero or one on-chain transaction. It doesn't seem to be instant either, requiring waiting for confirmations.

9390 2018-01-06 20:26:23 TL;DR: Yes. 
This discussion is a hot potato for years Embargoes & sanctions are put on countries who don't want to play according the rules set by major players. Africa S America, Ctrl America are held back in their development to accommodate the West. Read: @economic_hitman

9394 2018-01-06 20:26:07 We are building a crypto e-commerce site - the rate limiting step on litecoin consumer “use cases” is how to let a million users, new to crypto, buy $5 of litecoin at a time on our site using their traditional credit cards without too much friction or disproportional expense.
9395 2018-01-06 20:25:54 I was just chatting with some pals about this this morning. Good call Socal.

Droves of people desperately wanting in. We can probably thank CoinMarketCap for helping create the FOMO. Normies discover that site and see massive daily gains of +20% to +100% pumps.

9398 2018-01-06 20:25:50 Random thought: What happens when plenty ICOs and resulting coins, other crypto coins etc crash and disappoint people to the point where blockchain itself (which people assume to some how be the same as cryptos) isn't trusted by most people?

9400 2018-01-06 20:25:45 Its called reinvesting, if I won big in crypto I would first pay off all my bills and debt and take 50% and split that between CDs, IRAs, and 401ks for retirement while watching my previous investments still grow and prosper.

9424 2018-01-06 20:23:50 Can you see it ever truly competing as a currency alongside fiat? It’s adoption by the average joe in the real world, spending bitcoin from his bitcoin account over the dollars in his wallet, which is the hurdle of all hurdles. This might limit/un-limit crypto currency success

9444 2018-01-06 20:22:36 Yup. Charlie has my respect selling his $LTC. Goes to show he is actually focused on the project & not just trying to pump the price. Most people cannot understand this as most only care for profits & not what cryptos are fighting for. He’s the most legit man in crypto.
9445 2018-01-06 20:22:34 You can never keep up with crypto. Soo many alt coins
9446 2018-01-06 20:22:32 Agree block chain and its successors have good commercial potential. Crypto currencies not so much.

9454 2018-01-06 20:21:15 You could help me by accepting bitcoin. I feel it discriminatory against your international customers and wouldn't be any extra effort on your part to accept it.  #crypto #Bitcoin
9455 2018-01-06 20:21:00 @EdventureTime we gotta open a crypto coffee shop in 2020 with our crypto gains
9456 2018-01-06 20:20:52 @swissborg how long should crypto transfers take. Nothing in my account LTC sent awhile ago

9458 2018-01-06 20:20:50 Whats your advice about swaping it now or just keep holding to thr maximum decraesing at march
9459 2018-01-06 20:20:34 0x6877613113d0b83956601cae03e65a0d63c457a9
9460 2018-01-06 20:20:22 I agree. Just saying in case you want to buy more, so wait :)
9461 2018-01-06 20:20:20 Yes and no. GOV can confiscate land ownership not cash. Will they be able to confiscate crypto via the push of a keyboard in the near future?
9462 2018-01-06 20:20:17 $KIN is going to bring Crypto to the masses.
9463 2018-01-06 20:20:17 I get mine on bittrex.  If you don't already have an account, I'll give you my referral ID
9464 2018-01-06 20:20:08 Whoz selling?
9465 2018-01-06 20:19:39 Pro tip: get real comfortable with a single crypto. You'll be able to predict it nearly dead on
9466 2018-01-06 20:19:38 it's gonna be interesting to see, i think the fomo will be so great for btcp that we wont see a massive exit until after the release
9467 2018-01-06 20:19:27 yes possible but who cares when we look in future $1
9468 2018-01-06 20:19:20 look at the charts and RSI

9470 2018-01-06 20:19:02 @BithumbOfficial Look at me, bro. Remember the Korean War. This war make us blood brother. We need to keep brotherhood going. Now.. You should open membership to Turkey and begin to brotherhood of crypto.
9471 2018-01-06 20:19:01 "All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom." got lots of friends waiting for a binance account. So it possibly will not move very soon. But Wait untill the shop opens again. #trx to the moon ! #binance
9472 2018-01-06 20:18:54 The dual state of a "crypto as a day-to-day use currency" and "crypto as a speculative asset" can't both exist at the same time; true peer to peer crypto daily use currency hasn't been invented yet as it will require giving up greed and a core human-welfare perspective.

9474 2018-01-06 20:18:46 People have done stuff like sell their homes and put the money into crypto so I'm sure there is a lot of borrowed money there. I hope people have the good sense to pay it off ASAP at least, borrowing to buy something this volatile is just not safe.
9475 2018-01-06 20:18:43 You are the best @cryptomocho. 
This last year you gave calls that were unbelievable for me, at that point. Like $HTML at 1 satoshi :O
9476 2018-01-06 20:18:39 Please share 
9477 2018-01-06 20:18:36 That's fine. @SatoshiLite proposed new fee structures for $LTC that will make fees far lower than they currently are, which could pave the way for transactions in store. Nothing against $XRB, but it is currently a no-name crypto in the grand scheme of things.
9478 2018-01-06 20:18:34 Galaxy mind future: no crypto currencies

9494 2018-01-06 20:17:56 Wish there is a cryptocurrency that maintains the value of a pair currency(fiat, cypto) during transfers. For example, crypto may convert to USD(or BTC) after transfer is initiated and after the transfer completes back to crypto automatically.

9499 2018-01-06 20:17:28 Already made 50% on $linda in 30 hours... And judging by the market on @Cryptopia_NZ... It will be soon 20 Sats, from 18 sats right now.

9503 2018-01-06 20:17:09 Yeah I look forward to LN, but the fees with still be there (maybe even more). When I say transactional, I mean buying something at a store with it, not transferring btwn exchanges. I use LTC to transfer between exchanges. But when/if XRB ever becomes a main pairing, ill use that

9506 2018-01-06 20:16:53 Especially true in equities markets, the market will chew up and spit out the novice trader. You almost have no chance to be successful actively trading. But we in crypto yeeeet
9507 2018-01-06 20:16:45 The California gold rush created San Francisco, and so much value is still created there all the time.

9510 2018-01-06 20:16:36 The global market cap of #crypto will grow: Central Banks, like Ghana's and Bulgary's did, will start exchanging some of their assets to Bitcoin as a value storage.

9538 2018-01-06 20:14:44 I have to respectfully disagree with you there. Sure, $XRB is fine, but to say $BTC and $LTC could never be transactional is not correct. Currently, $LTC is THE transactional currency (volume % of market cap), and both $LTC and $BTC will be getting lightning network shortly.
9539 2018-01-06 20:14:42 Pro Tips: Don't look for resistance points only by what you see on the books... Look through charts and spot trends on the daily. You'll have a much better idea of what's really going on. #Crypto #Bitcoin

9560 2018-01-06 20:12:43 so how does this effect #crypto? Using one crypto currency to purchase another is a taxable event. using bitcoin to buy ether? Yup, taxable event. So consult your #tax #advisor on what to do for tax reporting!
9561 2018-01-06 20:12:39 For me his information about the partnership companies, new office in San Francisco, new hired IT-Specialists (like from Microsoft) and his main goal to decentralize the internet was new and very valuable. But I’m a newbie in the world of crypto currency/token.
9562 2018-01-06 20:12:37 hey man, I'm not hating. But they will never be transactional currencies. They are good stores of value and I like both BTC and LTC. All I was originally joking about was shilling RaiBlocks..lol if you want a demonstration on how instant it is let me know haha that is all

9566 2018-01-06 20:12:13 Remember when #Crypto used to mean Cryptography. 

Yeah, those were the days..

9568 2018-01-06 20:11:54 100 JPY(BTC): 1289.745 ~ 1292.008 KRW(BTC)
9569 2018-01-06 20:11:26 Because #crypto is considered property, it's my belief that it should be allowed to be subject to "like-kind exchange" rules. So what's the big deal? As of 1/1/18, like-kind exchange is only allowed on real estate transactions.
9570 2018-01-06 20:11:21 The latency would propagate exponentially throughout the internet  going up the levels of abstraction. Higher dns latency, slower tls/crypto, drop in throughout, then the latency of high-level services would increase by an order of magnitude, then the applications depending on it
9571 2018-01-06 20:11:21 If you're pricing $btcp at 1000$ then why not? I'm pricing it at $bcc mcap in 6 months. 

Wait until @BittrexExchange starts letting in new users. They are gearing up for it now. 

No one is factoring in that crypto market should 5x this year
9572 2018-01-06 20:11:19 @Haejin_Crypto I like your predictions. Can you do on Cardano? I am planning to get on.
9573 2018-01-06 20:11:02 You know what?  I bet working at a crypto hedge fund is fun as hell right now.
9574 2018-01-06 20:10:57 A Q around #Crypto #bitcoin. I buy a a $1000 designer with bitcoin. I want to return the watch next day. Bitcoin went  30%. How should the retailer pay me? $ or coin? What if bitcoin went  30%. How should the retailer pay me? What should I demand as consumer?
9575 2018-01-06 20:10:52 Finally! I need someone to tell me when to “exit all crypto markets!”
9576 2018-01-06 20:10:50 Why would the right team-- with technical knowledge of Monero better than ETN's current team-- not hardfork Monero themselves on their own terms, without clueless bosses dictating to them what to do?
Money comes easily in crypto and it's not the only motivator for the right team.

9581 2018-01-06 20:10:32 99% of the cryptocurrency market right now is composed of people asking either what crypto to buy or if they should sell their holdings or keep the position running.. It's actually quite scary how misinformed people are yet they still invest without doing ANY research at all.
9582 2018-01-06 20:10:25 The $10k crypto millionaire starts complaining he’s not making more than a 50% return weekly and moves on to speculating on penny stocks (again). Cashing out becomes hard and a stampede effect crashes the market
9583 2018-01-06 20:10:25 Very true and a big barrier to entry by the layman. Misinformation filling the gap potentially long term damaging to the rep of crypto. However, I think because the industry is still fledgling, there is nothing solid to communicate of any real-life relevance to “average jane” rn
9584 2018-01-06 20:10:20 Hablamos crypto!

9586 2018-01-06 20:10:01 Litecoin is a bitcoin fork that solves everything #BCash tried to solve and more, lol.
9587 2018-01-06 20:10:00 The crypto community should discourage all talk of “market cap” - well-worn in the world of finance already, the term comes laden with meaning that’s inapplicable to crypto-coins.

9593 2018-01-06 20:09:22 growing pains are inevitable when bridging the gap from the past to the future. Beyond these temporary gateways (exchanges), Crypto is going to cause a lot of real life 404 and 502 errors as time advances as well. We'll be here calmly marching forward, decentralized army united.

9595 2018-01-06 20:09:13 Not doubting its accuracy: I took Statistics, so I know how a poll works. What I am curious about, though, is the time frame this was conducted? If it was ended before, say, Thanksgiving, I'd dare say a poll done today would have higher crypto representation. ;)

9604 2018-01-06 20:08:35 I would like to see the involvement of all those who say decentralization.

Just buying cryptos barely helps pushing the technology further. In fact, with the actual bubble size it's only jeopardizing it further.

Resources are going to stimulation speculation instead.

9626 2018-01-06 20:06:55 And my $ETH tx took 6 hours before first confirmation. My only point is that nobody better be shilling #BCash because of this because it is definitely not the solution in this case (or in any case, but that's beside the point).

9628 2018-01-06 20:06:49 I use Bittrex as well. Have you studied other materials for volume that you can recommend. I'm very new to it but I think there's a lot of potential for huge profits in crypto using volume, since I'm trading it short term
9629 2018-01-06 20:06:47 The crypto world has too much steam for bitcoin to go anywhere but up in the next couple weeks the only thing I would back out of is alts
9630 2018-01-06 20:06:45 Josef Stalin did the same. Soviet time "crypto" was naming "trudoden'" (full working day). Population of the USSR mined this "crypto" all year around, and after that they changed their "crypto trudoden'" to a bread and Bonds of the state loan. Funny but not yet))
9631 2018-01-06 20:06:43 Because the TRX he owns are still in the wallet of which they provided the address for. Charlie Lee made this claim, Justin Sun validly refuted it, and Charlie Lee publicly apologized and deleted his tweet.

9639 2018-01-06 20:06:00 Hope it crashes crypto will boom when it does.
9640 2018-01-06 20:05:59 That goes under the assumption it could also be paid as dividends, but currently not feasible, at least not where I live, as both #CVM (SEC equivalent) and Central Bank denied crypto any asset classification so far, even though profits in $BRL are taxable.
9641 2018-01-06 20:05:59 Merci a toi
9642 2018-01-06 20:05:53 Yes, you Wil owe taxes at that point for the non llc period. But then if you create an llc file for say as an S corp then buy again. Everything after the S Corp would be in that category for tax purposes. If I'm wrong, please correct me.

9647 2018-01-06 20:05:16 It's proof that centralized banks move the blockchain markets.  And crypto speculation has ruined the dream of an alt payment system, with its promised benefits for developing countries with uncontrolled inflation.  All pumpers are complicit in destroying the utopian dream.
9648 2018-01-06 20:05:12 Wow so far nobody has used this as a shameful opportunity to suggest an alternative coin that would have done it better...

9651 2018-01-06 20:04:52 Great idea, most don't understand that 100% gain is 100% gain regardless of the starting price. Noob money artificially inflates crypto everyday.

9735 2018-01-06 19:58:29 We just all need to wait until CoinsMarkets is up and running again. Most exchanges are having problems at the moment. Coinexchange has been slow for days now & are up & down, Cryptopia have paused the $LTC & $Doge markets so there is a bit going right now.
9736 2018-01-06 19:58:25 FFS do at least A LITTLE research....
9737 2018-01-06 19:58:25 Hey man, glad you are back in the game ! This year will be even better for crypto and you are one of the best ! Waiting for a #xvg TA ! What do you reckon ?@PhilakoneCrypto

Thanks
9739 2018-01-06 19:57:47 I've heard nothing but bad things in sending crypto to ACR unfortunately. And the support (or lack thereof) is the reason why.
9740 2018-01-06 19:57:46 If you like #crypto #Patriots #Celtics #greenhouse #solar #juice #crystals #yoga #hemp #wine #marijuana #uber #stocks #newbusiness i want to interact with you on Twitter
9741 2018-01-06 19:57:42 The value of the market cap is not how much money there is but how much people are willing to pay.  Knowing how much oil there is in the ground doesn’t depreciate the value. 800 billion dollar mk reflects demand not money. $crypto has a lot of growing up to do.
9742 2018-01-06 19:57:42 afraid of being 100% in btc! Like everyone else i want to maximize this alt season. Do you ever go 100% in Alts? Plus whats your take on the season at this point. Many coins have gone 5-10x!
9743 2018-01-06 19:57:41 Crypto Currency: over 6000 exchanges operating now. A key element of crypto currency is the lack of intermediaries. Prevents others influencing what you want to do based on their policies. #METal-International
9744 2018-01-06 19:57:37 Transparent Society by @DavidBrin. It doesn't get into technical details abt crypto, but is awesome on privacy.
9745 2018-01-06 19:57:29 #Coinbase announces they are NOT planning on adding any coins anytime soon...Do you guys think #coinbase will ever add more #crypto #coins ?

9746 2018-01-06 19:57:29 It's come with most revolutionary techs that the old tech institutions that are being displaced fight or try to adapt it in a way that they are still relevant. It never works though. That's what ripple is trying to do. Don't take my word on it. Go deep enough and you will see.
9747 2018-01-06 19:57:25 
9748 2018-01-06 19:57:18 Keep a good financial record of all income and expenses, so you won’t ask later “where did my money go” or simply check your crypto wallets 
9749 2018-01-06 19:57:04 Nice to hear some good news

9752 2018-01-06 19:56:51 how long you think it would take to get to bittrex or binance?
9753 2018-01-06 19:56:47 Ha!...Everyone in crypto should just pin this to their twitter page.
9754 2018-01-06 19:56:44 bought around 400 yday ;)
9755 2018-01-06 19:56:38 3 days ago I activated a wallet with 0.1 ETH (worth 37 XRP) and nothing but unhelpful error messages until today. Now I see 19.98XRP. Should I trust @GateHub with any more crypto? I'm thinking no, unless you can give me a reason.
9756 2018-01-06 19:56:19 bruv 1 question, I cashed out of some coins, locking in gains in BTC! I see other coins with huge potential but i am kinda scared to go in. Initially the plan was to start cashing in btc slowly and gradually, but still see so many coins that can pump. is this season over or what?
9757 2018-01-06 19:56:17 If that were true then you would all keep your head down and focus on building the best product you can to achieve that vision - not focus on tearing down visions you don't agree with. But seriously, all the best. I hold $BTC as well - i just don't believe it's a zero sum game
9758 2018-01-06 19:56:16 Or into crypto
9759 2018-01-06 19:56:09 Are you just speculating on bittrex? havent heard any rumors…

9761 2018-01-06 19:55:46 There's one I haven't read that may touch on crypto, called Technocreep by Thomas Keenan.
9762 2018-01-06 19:55:43 Invest a portion of your income, and be patient to see it grow. If what you have in your hands is not good to be called a harvest then it’s a seed; sow it.
9763 2018-01-06 19:55:42 It has potential to be more than 39%, I dont know why you used that specific #

9771 2018-01-06 19:54:45 When/If I ever leave $crypto I'm going out like @kobebryant with a letter marked "Dear Crypto"

9774 2018-01-06 19:54:35 Na look's great, Definitely get rid of Ripple for WanChain, will be very profitable. Still gains to be made on Raiblocks "XRB" as not added to Binance yet.

9777 2018-01-06 19:54:27 No hate my friend. XRP might play the same game a little better. BTC changes the whole game. The faster everyone realizes this (and it's inevitable) the smoother the transition. That's all.
9778 2018-01-06 19:54:20 Bitcoin gambling is the only way to make money from crypto currency

9786 2018-01-06 19:53:53 That's pretty close to what I would do, yeah. You'll miss out on #altcoin action but that's about the safest portfolio you can put together for crypto while making good returns, just buy the dips and #HODL! Thanks for subscribing man!
9787 2018-01-06 19:53:50 ¿A qué te refieres con que "salga directamente en Wall Street"? Ya hay firmas financieras vendiendo futures, y transando Bitcoin y otras crypto para sus clientes
9788 2018-01-06 19:53:50 with that sort of marketing it will be inevitable

9790 2018-01-06 19:53:48 Thesis for market crash catalyst, Pt 1 new tax plan = 18 months to foreclosures of high COL area houses, dip in housing market = people liquidating crypto gains to buy property,  Pt 2 - korea & asian countries limit trade with USA, market drops, layoffs, people sell for fiat
9791 2018-01-06 19:53:45 I’m so blessed man. Today I reached my $ goal I set a few months ago, basically I’m going to be withdrawing a good chunk of my portfolio to: Pay off debt, put a down payment on a house, quit my real job, travel, and trade full time #startedfromthebottomnowwehere #bitcoin #crypto
9792 2018-01-06 19:53:41 Hopefully you were planning on shilling for a new exchange, as that's what's causing the problems right now. Not $BTC.

9798 2018-01-06 19:52:41 My perspective is from the megabanks, in reality laundering is pretty easy and crypto is just one of many tools
9799 2018-01-06 19:52:35 Even though I don’t hold any $DOGE, I wanna give a shout out to the #dogecoin community. They’ve consistently outperformed my expectations, and hands down they have the best community attitude out of anyone in crypto. Congrats on $100B market cap, guys.
9800 2018-01-06 19:52:17 The fact that Binance & Bittrex has closed registration says something. We are witnessing a HUGE financial revolution. When they reopen, so much money will flood in. Congrats to those who are in now & are active. Many millionaires will be born this year. Stay woke $crypto

9811 2018-01-06 19:51:15 @epeterson360 The only book I've read related is really good but it's history not future. Crypto by Steven Levy.
9812 2018-01-06 19:51:11 $rdd too ! 
9813 2018-01-06 19:51:06 After we officially include vtc. We all love vtc as well as many other crypto that we plan to add on later occasions.
9814 2018-01-06 19:50:50 If there's any claim for the #crypto world to be in a bubble it's because of these god damned lending platforms. $BTC
9815 2018-01-06 19:50:50 When @fbanalytics going to delve into Crypto Technology ?
9816 2018-01-06 19:50:46 They can enter using @coinbase (although it is VERY slow in processing #crypto withdrawals at the moment) and use their #bitcoin or #Ethereum to buy #altcoins in bleutrade, cryptopia etc  #altcoins is the future in #cryptocurrency
9817 2018-01-06 19:50:43 Will be the downfall eventually
9818 2018-01-06 19:50:31 Well, considering the plan clearly listed by tron is a 5 year plan with a clear timeline, one that he has met thus far, the only FUD you'd be experiencing is from people who haven't researched a thing about their investment. Crypto is a speculative market. They are bets.
9819 2018-01-06 19:50:11 @DonnyCrypto Why does anyone in the crypto-currency world care what other people do with their crypto-currency. Isn't that the whole point. I'm not going to ask Texas for permission to wipe my ass or spend my crypto.

9829 2018-01-06 19:49:30 Far out. Said I'd bet on it, not that it's a sure thing. You're right, the correlation is weak to non existent, but I'd still bet a big dump on Wall St shows up in crypto too, at least initially.
9830 2018-01-06 19:49:21 @justinsuntron did you sell all your #TRX tokens? If so, why?
9831 2018-01-06 19:49:21 When is @fbOpenSource going into the Crypto Technology? An ICO?
9832 2018-01-06 19:49:12 Marketing and teaching people about your product is not false hype,, did u use their platform ?
9833 2018-01-06 19:49:04 Every nation has zero crypto holders. They’re all hodlers.
9834 2018-01-06 19:48:56 At the moment I hold #xrp and #PacCoin . Iam happy. 
9835 2018-01-06 19:48:54 It is the best time to buy. "Picking up the dropping stock prices so that you can make profits." This is the basic rule of trading.  Think bigger.
9836 2018-01-06 19:48:54 You sound like the type of person who bought btc at 14k and bought xrp at 1.20$. Made a quick 2x and thinks he a professional crypto trader, lmao do you even own more than 1 btc? Or do you have like .006 LMAOOO.

9846 2018-01-06 19:48:04 I understand the reason why some people go anti-civ because neo-liberalism and “centrist” crypto-fascism spread like cancer through the Internet and technology. To be honest, I do plan to move to some Third World country and actually do something meaningful like a revolution.
9847 2018-01-06 19:48:04 what are some services that you use? i want to invest in crypto but dont know what to use. i was specifically thinking of dogecoin if that matters.
9848 2018-01-06 19:48:03 What about @eBCHCoin

9851 2018-01-06 19:47:55 The problem with crypto is that once there are a FUD and uncertainty regarding any coin CEO/Developer such as XVG, ppl will be scared and price drops. Truth and fact will be irrelevant. Remeber the FUD regarding XVG?! it is the same here. XVG never recovered from it.
9852 2018-01-06 19:47:45 Hello Crypto World. Looking forward to sharing this profitable journey with many people!
9853 2018-01-06 19:47:42 Suddenly I regret deciding to buy some crypto..

At least I'm not mining it myself anymore (I did right around whenever dogecoin suddenly became a thing).
9854 2018-01-06 19:47:37 what nation has the most crypto holders right? Only thing that makes sense anymore
9855 2018-01-06 19:47:14 So you trust $TRX for long term profits?
9856 2018-01-06 19:47:05 Cryptopia also down, can’t trade nothing today

Cryptopiaのレスポンスは通貨毎の連想配列が配列として返ってくるぞ

君たち静的言語にAPI叩かせる気ある？
9862 2018-01-06 19:46:59 Well your answer is $ETN huge total supply and a fork of monero. Massive partnership just signed and they don’t care about our crypto market cap they are going after the 99.5% of the world outside of crypto.  They are targeting mobile users who are 2billion on smart phones

9866 2018-01-06 19:46:48 I just bought a token up 165% on the DAY... #ROFL 'that's crypto going for another 100%' #standby
9867 2018-01-06 19:46:47 Look into $VXG (Verge Currency). It’s a fantastic play for a crypto portfolio in my opinion. #Litecoin has some promising releases too. Cheers!
9868 2018-01-06 19:46:40 Anyone else have their view of money forever skewed by crypto trading? I used to think of my salary as pretty good for my age, but looking at a 6k monthly paycheck now is just a "meh" moment these days...

9876 2018-01-06 19:45:40 And dot hasn’t had any dev in over a year and nothing really since 2014 , it’s basically a deadcoin
9877 2018-01-06 19:45:39 Its definitely legal in the crypto market ain’t stocks
9878 2018-01-06 19:45:35 Bcash= Btrash

You're coming at me for no reason which must mean you are mad about something and if i were to guess you're mad you've lost it all on #crypto cause you don't know what you're doing

it ok we all have bad weeks..

9879 2018-01-06 19:45:29 @Crypto_Ed_NL  thanks for exposing Crypto Rand; I had my suspicions once the shill began of DADI ICO (including his referral link). Unfollowed him because I don't want somebody whom I suspect of market manipulation  to influence me. Thanks again!
9880 2018-01-06 19:45:28 $NEBL making big moves... still low volume and tons of room for growth.  Exciting news in the very near future just adds to this long term hold for me #binance #crypto #neblio
9881 2018-01-06 19:45:25 yeah we ll have these stories in crypto. i bought substratum at 3cents and sold at 10. no it's $2.8. Bought kin at ico sold at a 10 percent loss now its a billion dollar coin and bought rpx at 3 cents but sold at 6cents. Weak hands dont profit in crypto.
9882 2018-01-06 19:45:21 @matt_sl i guess.. a week in crypto is like 6 months lol. Still new to any1 who missed it

9891 2018-01-06 19:44:23 I’m loving this crypto currency craze...... but how long can this last? IMO, this is ONLY the beginning of a new era, and will mint many millionaires 
9892 2018-01-06 19:44:21 I love spending hours each day reading, learning & gaining knowledge on all things Blockchain, Bitcoin, Crypto & ICO’s. There’s so much to learn. I find it all fascinating & super interesting & a topic that’s not going away.
9893 2018-01-06 19:44:21 Do you plan on opening up on any new exchanges, new to the crypto game but put abit of cash in and it's more than trippled, cheers @MySiacoin

9895 2018-01-06 19:44:16 mom and pop don't matter to the powers that be. If every crypto disappeared tomorrow, the central banks wouldn't notice.
9896 2018-01-06 19:44:15 $SHND #SHND StongHands coin caught my attention. Very cheap atm. Lots of room for growth this 2018. Bought a couple of hundred million coins. Let's see how high it can go.
9897 2018-01-06 19:44:14 same here, best investment to date
9898 2018-01-06 19:44:12 Exactly! There is no reason at all to take a loss it will go back up!
9899 2018-01-06 19:43:59 All these big "crypto traders" on Twitter are to be blamed. They trade these shitcoins and post TA's for their dumb followers and indirectly enrich the shitcoin scammers
9900 2018-01-06 19:43:50 I'm a client on several platforms for crypto derivatives, especially options, and Deribit is one of the best I know.

9933 2018-01-06 19:41:05 In the crypto space, do you think a YouTuber getting paid by ico's or companies in support of that token. should make it known in their videos? Please retweet this one !!!!
9934 2018-01-06 19:40:52 So I made some money in crypto, transferred $1,000 to my TenX card to treat my kids with new beds. get the email from TenX about Visa. Can’t transfer my BTC out! No new beds for the kids.

9955 2018-01-06 19:38:57 Yes, but it depends on the circumstances. With $KCS it's up x10 from two weeks ago, the opportunity cost risk did not outweigh the risk of a correction, so I sold just enough to cover my initial investment and now I'm emotion free.
9956 2018-01-06 19:38:53 The amount of resources scammers are willing to spend on a scam is equal to the amount of crypto they can steal from said scam. No other industry has such direct, low-risk ROI. It will only get worse.

9990 2018-01-06 19:35:15 All of these weak ass American investors who are trying to get rich are just transferring their wealth to China when they sell low. They need to have some sort of IQ test before allowing someone to trade crypto. #stronghands #trxretirementclub
9991 2018-01-06 19:35:14 I think it's going to be a huge theme, and probably a capital-S "Season" worthy period in $crypto history. Coin split season. "You had 2 $DASH? Now you have 2000!!!!" FOMO ensues.

10014 2018-01-06 19:33:07 Would love for $XRP to get back above 1700. $LEND keeps surprising me, outpacing $XRP, $XVG and $TRX. Reaching $1 this month would be amazing! #Crypto #HODL #XRP #XVG #TRX #LEND
10015 2018-01-06 19:33:02 I’m catching up on The Drum and they’re saying crypto currencies are for people illegally dealing with arms and drugs @r_nd_f__ld
10016 2018-01-06 19:33:00 History is being written by the fringes. The hackers, the crypto-fanatics, the alt-right, the neo-revolutionaries. The ones playing with new ideas while everyone else blows smoke up the old.

10023 2018-01-06 19:32:33 @DougPolkPoker would you be interested in a project that combines 2 of your big passions. Poker and crypto. I might have a good deal for you
10024 2018-01-06 19:32:29 WTF How does this happen? great information thanks
10025 2018-01-06 19:32:28 BTC 2nd layer solutions will do the same thing and better. One big difference, BTC was not a premined scam coin that the founders own 60%. You will never understand why BTC is more valuable of you don't understand the reason crypto currency was invented in the first place.
10026 2018-01-06 19:32:24 "Testing crypto with banks doesn't make sense. The whole idea of crypto is you don't need banks." That's funny, because now the transactions are even more expensive than traditional banking, not efficient, volatile, the original Bitcoin ideal is not real any more #CryptoMadness
10027 2018-01-06 19:32:10 $APPC great team and huge growth on #binance in 24 hours. Thoughts ?! #crypto #cryptotrading
10028 2018-01-06 19:32:08 Xlc looking strong. I decided to give crypto a go after seeing you and others tweeting about it. Red got me into the group and I’ve not looked back since. 4 bags since I started a week ago!
10029 2018-01-06 19:32:08 #APPC lol what??? people have working products in the crypto world 
10030 2018-01-06 19:32:05 Friend put flowers in guest BR, next day 1,000 preying mantis appear, closes door, checks each day, each day fewer until one day only one big one. Scoops it up and sets it outside in her garden.

This is what happens when you trade crypto in a bull market. #HODL
10031 2018-01-06 19:32:03 exactly just breathe man David the thing relieve in crypto
10032 2018-01-06 19:31:50 ADAサイドチェーン実装するのか。
というかADAはマーケット戦略より技術開発に重点置きすぎ。
なんかほんと、コンテンツより研究って感じだね～
10033 2018-01-06 19:31:48 I trade some crypto but I still don’t enjoy it as much as stocks and options.
10034 2018-01-06 19:31:45 My brother hits me up every other day about investing in crypto, Dude 18 hasn’t even graduated yet & already seeing gains... I couldn’t be happier

10036 2018-01-06 19:31:39 Random thought... is crypto currency the ultimate money laundering mechanism? If I had $10mm I was trying to get back in the system, why not just claim you made it trading Dogecoin?
10037 2018-01-06 19:31:37 Smart move by @GoldmanSachs to embrace change and adapt (launching Crypto trading desk this year.) 

@MerrillLynch and @UBS on the other hand are going the opposite way. 

You know which bank stock to buy this year.
