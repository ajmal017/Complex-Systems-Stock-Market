1 2019-01-09 23:59:44 Nintendo fuck your Smash Servers. I wasn't lagging, the match was running smoothly as possible with no button lag. Yet I get punished for 1hr - 26m ban for losing two stocks from a spamming Chrom and Inkling. It was probably the Pokemon Trainer that died first and DC yet I get

4 2019-01-09 23:57:56 $TGT will lower tomorrow. I'm going to load it back. $AMZN will be down soon then $TGT AND $WMT Will be up. Retail stocks only them the best. Banks down tomorrow too. $BAC I have to take back for call option sold long time ago. Needs to be ready for ER man

6 2019-01-09 23:57:13 Very noble. Never mind the lives ruined and families uprooted, as long as your stocks perform.
7 2019-01-09 23:56:14 Final verdict is 2-2 in the smash 5 tourney at agdq. I feel like I made too many small mistakes that added up to stocks being taken but that's what learning is all about c: rather content that I didnt go 0-2!  <3
8 2019-01-09 23:55:46 I initially read "stocks" and I was confused.
I re-read it and still remain confused.
9 2019-01-09 23:55:46 With $ACB being the late to break the trend I think we need to see volume confirmation and a few sessions above that resistance before its full bull mode. The pain of cannabis stocks is they can move +/- 10% in a day
10 2019-01-09 23:54:57 Im a middle aged housewife whose only investment money is what I make selling jewelry at craft fairs and leftover grocery money. I have snaggled away over 1000 MPX in the past few months. While my friends are out buying shoes Im bagging pot stocks. Its not much but maybe one day!
11 2019-01-09 23:54:49 Hi. Question on how do you filter which stocks to trade on in a day like today. Is it by relative strength or do you use any other filter. Good trades btw.
12 2019-01-09 23:54:26 I have 25k invested in stocks for retirement damn y’all that shit adds up
13 2019-01-09 23:54:21 I don't doubt your knowledge of TA. I respect TA but crypto is the new asset class and XRP is the only utility asset within that class
TA can't account for it because it is completely different from lets say stocks

So called "flip of the switch" will blow TA away immediately
14 2019-01-09 23:54:12 Oh yeah, allows bump stocks, semi automatic weapon, open carry - really good laws - and the killing goes on and on and on - what is your solution, what if your family member were gunned down?
15 2019-01-09 23:53:24 As a business student, yes I do love stocks.
16 2019-01-09 23:53:13 Les stocks reconstitués : haut de cycle. Les trésoreries importantes (là aussi, c'est très disparate) sont le signe de la difficulté à investir. Juste augmenter les salaires (par quel outil d'ailleurs ?) ne ferait qu'aggraver nos déséquilibres macro-économiques sans perspective.
17 2019-01-09 23:53:00 im going to twist your head off if you queue 1v1 smash with time instead of stocks
18 2019-01-09 23:52:52 i think we should go back to the 80s when american society and business was fueled by the stuff. give it to kids and throw them in an econ class, then once they graduate throw them straight into the stocks market, it'll be really good.
