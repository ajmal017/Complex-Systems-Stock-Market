1 2018-10-10 23:59:47 I was asked twice why my profile picture was "like that".
It's an oil portrait of mine painted by a friend I came out to first. Years later, she died incidentally - only last NYE. In her honour I am using it. There. #WorldMentaHealthDay

5 2018-10-10 23:59:11 Agree oil co lie for profit (BP), Still support Vostok. No 1:1 correlation. Main push "for" global warming $ - 1) Create BS green startups, 4 crooks like Soros, Gore & 2) Carbon Taxes to killoff US (failed) for NWO plans. That said, should we be nicer to mother earth? Yes.

There wasn't an $18bn balance of payment gap. The loans you took & CPAC project undertaken now needs paying back. The extra electricity we are producing needs extra oil & gas which needs to be paid in dollars. Export went down by 15% in your tenure.

Asian Paints took a 2-3% price hike in Oct'18. Checks indicate another 4-5% hike in Dec'18 likely if crude oil price remain elevated

14 2018-10-10 23:57:56 @RossowV however, and despite the fact that I have sent him numerous messages on whatsapp, he does not answer me. I need your help to get in touch with another cooperative or marula oil producer. I want to start a business with this product for which I need a serious and reliable
15 2018-10-10 23:57:52 @realDonaldTrump I thank you for resolutely saying that no country will be exempted from the oil embargo. This was the message of the President of the United States and everyone should cut off their oil from Iran by November 4.
16 2018-10-10 23:57:43 So i just tried this new oil mix on my hair and I was hoping that it smelled ok cz its strong and this lady in Walmart came up to me and said you smell sooo good what is that I told her it was my hair and just oils she was mind blown.

36 2018-10-10 23:57:34 I'm only planning to do 1 tier, it would just go to waste as not enough people to eat it! No just a fairly basic vegan sponge with sunflower oil, vinegar and soy milk! No idea what I will do for buttercream though, PB is vegan so might use that as a starting point 
37 2018-10-10 23:57:28 Bahahaha natives in ND get oil money, casino money, free health care, and most have jobs. Get the facts strait. Natives have pride. Natives have id's. This is 100% about suppressing voter fraud.

40 2018-10-10 23:57:06 I use the LCO method, well I’m trying to now, so the oil can seal it all in. Butttt a good way of avoiding that grainy white stuff happening. If I’m adding in a new product, I’ll mix a lil bit with the others in the palm of my hand to see if they work together
41 2018-10-10 23:56:41 @RossowV Dear Veronique, good morning, my name is Aníbal Valenzuela. I am writing to you because I have been trying to acquire a sample of marula oil for tests in my country, Chile. The contact is Martha Negumbo from EWC
42 2018-10-10 23:56:00 Can't you just appoint some 23 year old whizz kid who hates Big Oil ?
43 2018-10-10 23:55:56 That girl has drank too much of Obama's snake oil. She needs to lie on Blasey's couch if she can find the back door

50 2018-10-10 23:55:10 I did when I lived in Georgia. How long it take to change oil. Mines done in 20 minutes
51 2018-10-10 23:55:04 I think that was the final year for the oil.
52 2018-10-10 23:54:57 Yeah, we could always turn off the oil spigot too.
53 2018-10-10 23:54:55 It’s nice there but probably Carmel By The Beach.  Big Sur. Even Pismo  and Ventura
54 2018-10-10 23:54:48 Got the gas and the splash like an oil spill
55 2018-10-10 23:54:47 Olive oil, lemon and sumac!
56 2018-10-10 23:54:46 Guyana get a lot of hopes for this oil eh 
57 2018-10-10 23:54:41 Although Hurricane Michael is not a direct threat to Jamaica it will most likely drive up the price of oil.
58 2018-10-10 23:54:41 Not only jet lag, being away from family and an extensive road trip... let’s take a huge break in playing (because of jet lag) while other teams struggle to find their D pairings and a solid PK.  Oil get to watch other players rack up individual stats.

61 2018-10-10 23:54:28 Raja - read between the lines on this one.  You’re both right.  IEA’s beggen for oil cryen wolf.  Launching capex today means oil in 5-7 years.  Vitol is saying Saudi’s claim to got this one let them have it.  Too many forces manipulating pricing, going to bite Birol/Trump hard.
62 2018-10-10 23:54:23 Well, the reason why I picked oil, because the oil spreads through water/animal movement.

So everything ends up corrupted in the end.
63 2018-10-10 23:53:50 What are the repayment terms? For how long angolan oil will be basically owned by China?

66 2018-10-10 23:53:34 favorite misconception has to be that coconut oil is good for your skin, like ladies its 4/5 (5 being the most) comedogenic, shit clogs your pores! try some tea tree oil instead #saveyourskin
67 2018-10-10 23:53:24 @shattawalegh Sark You Have Put Cassava In To Palm Kernel Oil  Prepare For War...... 
68 2018-10-10 23:53:22 Oh full later cake would great but make sure it’s stable don’t want it sinking! Are you using coconut oil? Oh no pressure we will see! Hmm true it’s going to be harder not to use an electric whisk!
69 2018-10-10 23:53:19 Trump and big oil forcing you to do this crap? Shame!
70 2018-10-10 23:52:53 Yeah! I like to add sesame or chili oil too
71 2018-10-10 23:52:43 This country goes to war over oil but does nothing to to stop unspeakable human brutality or genocide - we should have invaded Myanmar and proven our good Christian morals ABD ethics. But no, no surprised and most telling. We did nothing in Darfur either, or several other places.
72 2018-10-10 23:52:33 This city continues to eat itself.  All that will be left is a rotten core when thes snake oil salesmen(women) are done with it.
73 2018-10-10 23:52:30 we only have 22 years , time to move away from oil
74 2018-10-10 23:52:13 Tea tree oil is the second worst invention ever.
75 2018-10-10 23:52:02 Things that help me with my stress & anxiety:

-The @calm app
-Chamomile or Peppermint tea
-Getting up from my desk and taking a walk or going to another floor of the office
-Cardio/weight training

79 2018-10-10 23:51:18 yes, because it is okay if 60% of the forest is covered in oil vs. 100%
80 2018-10-10 23:51:17 And how many are filling their vehicles with foreign oil because Canadian oil can't flow east because Energy East was prevented by Eastern Canadians?? What a joke!! Buy Canadian hypocrits!! Ha!!
81 2018-10-10 23:51:16 I can’t wait for my skin to go back to normal after I give birth. I stay bathing in lotion and oil and nothing seems to help my dry skin 
82 2018-10-10 23:51:08 Our government seems to forget that 15 of the 19  9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. I wonder how much we would kowtow to them if they didn’t have oil & money.
83 2018-10-10 23:51:05 Beto wants to upend the oil industry in Texas. How does that make any sense. He will lay-off oil workers and hurt oil workers families. No Beto No!!!
84 2018-10-10 23:51:00 Depends if the oil in fry vat was changed in the last week or so.
85 2018-10-10 23:50:59 she is a member of the "anyone owns the oil from Scotland's water except Scotland" brigade!

86 2018-10-10 23:50:34 Economical wars between countries for the lands, oil, islands, food takes life, shed bloods, empty emotions.

90 2018-10-10 23:50:22 Yes it will. Blow over, that is. Shouldn't, but will. Blow over. Absent answers, USA should stop buying Saudi oil, stop selling them weapons, but that ain't gonna happen. Hell, the Saudis could kill half of Yemen and we'd not say a word. Opps, the Saudis are doing just that.
91 2018-10-10 23:50:14 Sounds like you’re have a great time. Good for you I went to work now I’m ordering a pizza and drinking Vodka. Living the single life. Glad someone is enjoying themselves
92 2018-10-10 23:50:11 can never go wrong with coconut oil!!! It’s natural and anti fungal/Bacterial
93 2018-10-10 23:50:06 Well a good machine never forgets its programming. Even if it has to oil up the joints first.

96 2018-10-10 23:49:33 Try $3.33 in the California county where we actually *produce* oil -- which is a bargain compared to the rest of the state. (It hit a low of $3.19 over the summer, and I was jumping for joy.)
97 2018-10-10 23:49:33 Good thing we don’t depend on oil at all for our economy either.

103 2018-10-10 23:48:36 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.

113 2018-10-10 23:47:08 The world has gone mad.
God alone knows how this will end.
If the extremists of all sides have their way then the west will collapse and civilisation as we know it as well.
Perhaps this is what Soros wants??
Along with the middle East oil and Ukrains agriculture.

119 2018-10-10 23:46:21 I've seen all you wrote in your thread but hope you know when oil prices fell globally some people were still have reserves of over five hundred billion dollars. What happened to our reserves?
120 2018-10-10 23:46:15 The oil still went further to $25/b, militancy shut down production 4 close 2 a year till 2016, yet we came.out of recession, we didn't go Venezuela way, we r growing @ d rate our infrastructure can  handle yet pple r complaining..growth is not a wishful thing bro..takes efforts

125 2018-10-10 23:45:29 Trump does not understand how our economic system works.
He created tarrifs to tax the middle class and poor and made a minor dent in NAFTA.
He gave corporations a huge tax cut.
China is retaliating against the U.S.
They bought no oil from the US in the month of August.

130 2018-10-10 23:44:41 if you hate oil and everything the involves it so much go live in the bush nude while the rest of us enjoy LITERALLY EVERYTHING BECAUSE OIL IS IN FUCKING EVERYTHING
131 2018-10-10 23:44:20 Agreed. The global economy is precarious, wages are stagnant, trade wars imminent, oil high. No inflation thus accomodate and raise slowly and gingerly.
132 2018-10-10 23:44:16 I just threw it in a pan with some olive oil
133 2018-10-10 23:44:07 No one believes Friends of Oil & Rebel media. Other than those thirsty for their Flavor Aid

135 2018-10-10 23:43:43 I just can't suspend my disbelief/ take in the alternative-ness of it all. Germany had no manpower, industrial capacity, resources (oil) or jewish physicists/scientists to the war.
136 2018-10-10 23:43:26 You gonna talk about your RUSSIAN OIL MONEY SHAM?

138 2018-10-10 23:43:13 I think the Bible says it tasted like wafers made with honey, so sweet. When turned into flour and baked, cakes made with oil. But then, we all have our own Holy Grail, so why not our own manna?

140 2018-10-10 23:43:03 @stgatchalian why don’t you visit DOE Oil & Gas Division and learn if the country’s petroleum potential is viable for intensive drilling exploration. You have any idea the cost of sinking a 2500 meters offshore or onshore explo well?
141 2018-10-10 23:42:52 Further, push through pipelines and refineries so, like the U.S. we can become energy independent. As long as we have to buy their oil we are complicit!
142 2018-10-10 23:42:52 At this time 80million Nigerians we're in povertt...At 2015, when PDP was handing over, oil was $45/b, FR was $29B, excess crude was $2.1B...so what magic will anyone do with this financial situation n 90% import dependence that will prevent many more to go into.poverty?
143 2018-10-10 23:42:33 Wow, kudos to Trump for fitting a surprisingly large amount of bullshit into such a small document. Not that I’m surprised. He works in bullshit the way some artists work in oil paint or clay. True mastery.
144 2018-10-10 23:42:16 Bikes don't leak oil, they mark their territory. #quotes
145 2018-10-10 23:42:14 susah pak kalo premium ga ikut naik soalnya pertamina di awal tahun 2018 sampe 5T dan kemungkinan rugi diakhir tahun 2018 mencapai 30T. ini mah gara gara crude oil yang lagi tinggi. kalo ga dinaikkan mau ditambal pake apa pak?
146 2018-10-10 23:42:10 Not only that, Our youngest used to have prolonged bronchitis- so we used to admit him to the hospital right and left, finally.. a man from "Baajuun" Community told mom, give him Qubah Oil... In seven days he relieved and never come back that illness again to my brother.!
147 2018-10-10 23:41:53 From what I understood polyunsaturated fat becomes unhealthy when it’s processed/heat applied to which is vegetable oil is bad for you do to processing that polyunsaturated fat goes through for vegetable to be made.
148 2018-10-10 23:41:45 one time I put leftover fried rice oil on my lips instead it was a low point  @ebloomie will confirm
149 2018-10-10 23:41:39 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
150 2018-10-10 23:41:26 I remember my mum putting Olbas Oil on my pillow at night. It was terrible. Used to get mashed into my eyes.  It’s a rank below Pepper Spray that shit.
151 2018-10-10 23:41:25 Interestingly, the biggest beneficiaries of AGOA are multinational oil and gas firms.
152 2018-10-10 23:41:21 Ya boi here has an addiction to coconut oil
153 2018-10-10 23:41:08 I have a friend that only ever texts me around midnight....im not saying its spooky I'm just saying...erm... Anybody got some left over anointing oil?

156 2018-10-10 23:40:39 Middleeast oil money mending all bridges lol
157 2018-10-10 23:40:38 Tom Waits facing mortality meets scholar opining about international political economy and order circa 2050 as of 1993, just after Bone Machine dropped. Coincidence? Check out my dissertation: "The Earth Died Screaming: A Marxian Analysis of 21st Century Oil Power"
158 2018-10-10 23:40:36 Nahh my hair sucks up product like nothing. I use three biggg pumps of conditioner atm as well as big of oil to seal it. Well today I used a lil shea butter mix I made

160 2018-10-10 23:40:21 Last time I checked he is on the team and plays a third of every game, so that is part of the equation. That said, I am confused. If you think they are nowhere near good enough, why would you hope/expect for a good start out of the gate?
161 2018-10-10 23:40:20 Imagine being a grown ass woman stuffing VS gift wrap into a condom and spilling baby oil in ya pussy. LMAO
162 2018-10-10 23:40:16 So you want to tell me that consequences of actions r instantaneous? We ve lot of people living in poverty den..those irresponsible actions of past sunk more people into poverty..I like facts too.. as at 2010, oil was over $100/b we had FR at over $50B n excess crude at 0ver $10B

165 2018-10-10 23:40:11 You guys. The place where I got my canibis oil for my crohns there was a floukru sumbol on their card! Small world eh?
166 2018-10-10 23:39:50 Wash your face with coconut oil!! It really does wonders! 
167 2018-10-10 23:39:42 ISIS+Oil=Saudi Arabia
168 2018-10-10 23:39:40 GOP has no integrity. Snake oil sales.
169 2018-10-10 23:39:38 Becoming an adult is asking my dad to do a full check (brakes, tires, oil, all fluids, fan belt, timing belt etc) on my car as my birthday present, and asking my mom to clean it 
170 2018-10-10 23:39:24 Problems in Venezuela are long time over-dependence on oil, not PR. Oil price crashed, hyper-inflation occurred. Russia previously discussed. No problem if countries take longer to form proper government following elections. Italy, Israel systems not being considered in Canada.
171 2018-10-10 23:39:23 Good Lord.
172 2018-10-10 23:39:18 gonna be burning the midnight oil tonight. only time I have peace.
173 2018-10-10 23:39:13 If I google "Photoshop Oil Paint." Don't show me some filter BS. I don't want to see topaz and calling it "Oil Paint." Show me how to ACTUALLY Paint in an oil paint style in photoshop...
174 2018-10-10 23:39:11 crispy asparagus with lemon juice and olive oil is the best side dish, change my mind

176 2018-10-10 23:39:00 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
177 2018-10-10 23:38:53 They forgot to mention changing the gear ratios, changing the oil, and putting in new pistons.
178 2018-10-10 23:38:44 Lol. No I was saying alex jones is another "America just wants the oil" kinda guy. Like what you were saying.
179 2018-10-10 23:38:43 Really? What American politician will risk cutting off its long term oil supply, investments, & relations with an absolute monarchy which contributes millions of US$$$ to both Dem & GOP campaigns? #ResistanceRises
180 2018-10-10 23:38:20 Amazing Yttttttttty!!!!
181 2018-10-10 23:38:18 Slap on some castor oil
182 2018-10-10 23:38:15 That coconut oil keeps my skin so moistured I love it
183 2018-10-10 23:38:08 Nah but even with people with naturally curly hair, like do they not bother to dry their hair or do they just slather it with oil for no reason?
184 2018-10-10 23:38:04 Congrats! Just be careful with your good cholesterol is not too low. Mine HDL is always between 37 -39. Needs to be over 40. I have to eat good fats like avocados, almonds and olive oil plus excerise. Great job!!
185 2018-10-10 23:37:58 Coconut oil works wonders, I recommend it to all of my clients. Don’t use bepanthen or any healing/antiseptic creams. If you can’t get coconut oil then any unscented moisturiser should do it
186 2018-10-10 23:37:44 All of the above. Also, the world just realized Saudi Arabia is ruled by a homicidal maniac in alliance with our Orange Moron's crime family. Oil is going to get pricey.
187 2018-10-10 23:37:34 Next time... baby oil! 
188 2018-10-10 23:37:34 I wanted ditch my car. Then I read the owner's manual, got a tune-up,oil change, new tires and brakes and then ran it thru the carwash.

Now, she's doing fine!
189 2018-10-10 23:37:27 u know I had to re-up on the oil cart
190 2018-10-10 23:37:05 อีพวกเด็กเหี้นนี่
191 2018-10-10 23:36:57 The fact that I haven’t tried to put coconut oil in my smoothies until just now has me totally baffled... it’s the additional bump of fat I need in my diet... and it’s DELICIOUS!!! Blueberries and coconut, yes Ma’am!
192 2018-10-10 23:36:50 Or that England manufactures fee (if any) finished goods and has zero global brands? They subsidize no one, never mind their oil, whisky and tech-rich northern neighbour.
193 2018-10-10 23:36:39 Tell that to Standard Oil or Ma Bell.
194 2018-10-10 23:36:36 ok I’ve done my research and I’m thinking of incorporating cod liver oil capsules into my vitamin regime.
195 2018-10-10 23:36:24 And diplomats on Foreign Relations. Just as long as there aren't too many bankers on Financial Services, or too many oil execs on Natural Resources.
196 2018-10-10 23:36:15 It’s almost that time of the year where the babies need fish oil pills. Mabel has never had them and I am TERRIFIED of her fish oil burps. Kitty rarely burps and Mabel is like a got damn frat boy
197 2018-10-10 23:36:04 Take a look at his connections and assertions/perspective, in the BIG OIL spill litigations.
198 2018-10-10 23:35:56 WE NEED TO STOP CONSUMING OIL. WE NEED SOLAR ENERGY. WE NEED BIODEGRADABLE EVERYTHING. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND REALIZE THAT LIFE IS NOT ABOUT CONVENIENCE. EARTH COMES FIRST. WE NEED TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. PLEASE ENCOURAGE CHANGE OR BE THE CHANGE
199 2018-10-10 23:35:42 So as I said before, everyone else is wrong and Labour are right. Thanks for confirming that. We'll see how that pans out when we start importing oil and gas from countries with lower environmental standards than us. Have a good day.
200 2018-10-10 23:35:29 Oh my god i almost just ruined it all.. my brothers vape was on his bed and I grabbed it and went to hit it and he just stared at me like wtf don’t hit my vape, so I said fuck that and hit the button looked down and saw there was a fucking oil cartridge on it not vape juice...
201 2018-10-10 23:35:07 So Twitter family, wen pot goes legal here , I'm looking into finding something non narcotic for my back pain..I have seven herniated discs and I'm on 120 mg of methadone a day for pain....I wanna get off it totally and I heard CBD OIL is a wonder drug....any thots on it?
202 2018-10-10 23:35:04 今月の週末がほぼ毎週予定埋まってたとか、慢性的なモチベの低下とか、いろいろな理由ですね。何ヵ月も先の予定を考えないといけないのでむずかしいところ。
203 2018-10-10 23:35:04 I want an essential oil diffuser for Christmas. I know you’re reading this Kim.
204 2018-10-10 23:34:45 As to Alberta oil being not smelly, you been there sweetie?  It ain't a pleasant smell.  And it is the second highest production cost and lowest amount of energy per barrel.  Nice huh?
205 2018-10-10 23:34:44 Oil companies are terrified of Tesla, as they should be. The Model 3 is changing the world.
206 2018-10-10 23:34:40 Excuse me, do you know if this baby oil is cold-pressed ?
207 2018-10-10 23:34:26 Harp oil (for the strings)
208 2018-10-10 23:34:24 in the UK and Spain. But I prefer to work with the Police to catch criminals using Psycho-Criminology. But Comrades, thank you for making awareness of our stuggle, I have to use Cannabis Oil the best, Alprazolam (Xanax) only available on the private sector in the UK and Valium.
209 2018-10-10 23:34:21 Dropping my car off for an oil change and I’ll be live 
210 2018-10-10 23:34:15 No and I have never had a planetar motor go out but I check them every year and change the oil in them
211 2018-10-10 23:34:05 Methinks the oil industry is the most corrupt industry on the face of this earth! And it's $$$ and political influence is second to none.
212 2018-10-10 23:33:52 Cinnamon oil is delish! I use it in my made from scratch oatmeal cookies instead of powdered cinnamon. Only 6 drops in a dbl batch recipe and it's Heaven in your mouth! I also use cinnamon oil on bee stings and it literally takes the sting right away as well as the inflammation
213 2018-10-10 23:33:49 Didn’t need to be need although there was some that added to things. FAANGbstock and SMH which had bee market fuel have been sinking for some time SMH high in June. China has tanked, and BIG build in oil on hand. #ContributingFactors
214 2018-10-10 23:33:36 People need to relax  it’s early.
The oil will be alright......
If not, weed is legal soon. That should help.#oilers
215 2018-10-10 23:33:36 They have long been susceptible to snake oil charmers who promise to bring back jobs gone for over 30 years. They fear change, fear "the other" they think STOLE their jobs, and he packaged a sales pitch about them that hid who he was really helping.
216 2018-10-10 23:33:34 おはようゆたたたたたたたたた
217 2018-10-10 23:33:24 Exactly....so, which side of the equation is wrong here??  $75 oil or $2.00 gasoline.  Because last I checked, people don't put oil in their gas tank :)
218 2018-10-10 23:33:18 Hummus- are you allowing flavoured oil? Particularly keen at the moment at using basil oil in mine
219 2018-10-10 23:32:59 CBD oil.  It’s the best thing on the market
220 2018-10-10 23:32:58 Bio oil is the shittttt
221 2018-10-10 23:32:56 I baked some salmon in coconut oil... life changing
222 2018-10-10 23:32:55 I used three hot tools. THREE. Plus a pomade and an oil. It’s a big ol triangle!!!
223 2018-10-10 23:32:55 Saifuah Mai Gray, CEO of the National Oil Company of Liberia is even being underpaid compared to Presidents/CEOs of other National Oil Companies in Africa. 
Please don’t get it twisted.
224 2018-10-10 23:32:53 Freaky Russia fetish aside, 
DANA SUCKS because:

-Coddles white-supremacists 
-Won’t debate  @HarleyRouda 
-Rejects Gun Reforms
-Voted for #TrumpCare 
-Rejects Climate Science 
-Supports offshore oil drilling
-Fake Surfer

30yrs of ineptude&incompetence

228 2018-10-10 23:32:38 It also supports cost reduction. Carbon and cost are joined at the hip for the oil sands b/c burning natural gas. Reduce emissions, you reduce costs.

231 2018-10-10 23:32:15 Made garlic Parmesan fries today. 

Fresh minced garlic minced super fine, used grated *and shredded* Parmesan.

Cooked butter, olive oil, fresh parsley, sea salt in a pot.
232 2018-10-10 23:31:56 Ok so why are you there. Except to work to stop the oil industry from contributing to Alaska’s tax revenue. I’m proud of our oil industry. But not for lack of state tax revenue
233 2018-10-10 23:31:54 Maybe a better plan is to lower the demand?? Any country is stupid to not sell a resource if they have it and there is a demand for it. So maybe these anti oil heros should get out and start protesting oil based products.
234 2018-10-10 23:31:40 Y’all watch too much porn talmbout some damn baby oil sex lmfaoo but lemme shut my vanilla sex having self up I guess 
235 2018-10-10 23:31:36 Do the Saudis have any credibility? Thank God that Canada has more oil than you guys. At least Venezuela uses its petrodollars on its people.
236 2018-10-10 23:31:19 How about getting rid of Traitor tRump who has pushed policies that make climate change worse, and get hurricane relief funds from oil companies that knew in the 1970s that this was going to happen, and sat on the reports? #ExxonKnew
237 2018-10-10 23:31:16 Ghetto oil pressure test complete #trailblazerlife
238 2018-10-10 23:31:06 data is the new oil - an important resource which we need to use wisely. Great sessions at #CHC18

247 2018-10-10 23:30:00 I was about make a bomb ass dinner and as I got everything out and cut the potatoes I realized there was no cooking oil.. I’m devastated
248 2018-10-10 23:29:34 We'll only w/draw support by stopping our use of oil. That's only reason we care about KSA or Israel. Seriously, electric cars will be the main weapon in regaining independence. Good news: Tesla Model 3 is currently #4 selling car in USA. This is possible.
249 2018-10-10 23:29:34 You ain't said nothing slick to a can of oil
250 2018-10-10 23:29:16 You’re really working your way through the denialism playbook this evening, huh? It’s a feedback loop, so either can initiate the other, but 90% of temperature change has historically lagged CO₂. And, apart from shills for oil companies, scientists don’t say things for money.
251 2018-10-10 23:28:59 Sorry... I can't hear you over all this oil wealth. Crimes against humanity? What crimes? #SaudiArabia
252 2018-10-10 23:28:56 The Nivea body oil is good. Dry fast and moisturizes. Doesn’t leave a stain and smells really fresh and clean.
253 2018-10-10 23:28:49 Don't take anymore!  Oil of cloves might help.
254 2018-10-10 23:28:31 It’s what ancient oil lamps look like

257 2018-10-10 23:28:02 La deuda de Oil de $9500 millones que mantiene Cristóbal Lopez con la Afip es el cuento de nunca acabar(por lo visto no somos todos iguales ante este ente recaudador)atrasate una cuota del IVA,te intiman y persiguen como a un delincuente.Pagan los giles,poderosos c/coronita
258 2018-10-10 23:28:00 We acknowledge their commitment to being sent to foreign lands and getting their balls blown off by an IED to ensure the free flow of oil 
259 2018-10-10 23:27:42 Floors: Dr. Bronner's lavender soap (+lemon essential oil sometimes)
Kitchen: Mrs. Meyers radish spray (from you! I have the soap now too!)
Bathroom: Method pink grapefruit spray is a must, imo
Dryer sheets for places like baseboards, to prevent future dust
260 2018-10-10 23:27:37 I just remember Adams Oshiomole used to be Labour leader fighting for the rights of Nigerian workers and against increasing oil prices. How people change.
261 2018-10-10 23:27:34 You can’t cripple the existing economy, though. That’s where it gets tricky. In these early stages the revenue from fossil fuels MUST go towards developing green energy solutions. But you can’t have one without the other. So for today, oil gets piped to tidewater.
262 2018-10-10 23:27:32 The word spectacularly should be used for the previous ones cos they had it so good, in yrs, in high oil income but this had only over 3yrs with just rising oil income in this quarter..it's been borrowing to fund infrastructure neglected by previous ones...this one has tried
263 2018-10-10 23:27:32 Just get out of Syria. It is NOT your country. You are occupying it illegally and have no right to steal it's oil. I am sick and tired of the USA bombing the Middle East. Who do you think you are? You don't rule the planet. How would you like it if someone invaded YOUR country 
264 2018-10-10 23:27:32 *is behind on 2 credit cards*
*needs oil change and tire rotation*
*no money in checking account*
*buys Starbucks and lunch for a 4th time this week*

It’s fine.
265 2018-10-10 23:27:18 who uses baby oil as lubricant though that's the real question #lrt
266 2018-10-10 23:27:09 May try to buy Trump off with cheaper oil prices
267 2018-10-10 23:27:02 Your pp sucks like the Oil! I don’t see 5 left handed players wake up bro!
268 2018-10-10 23:27:00 Anything for oil......
269 2018-10-10 23:26:52 There you go, Sis!! Get that oil!
270 2018-10-10 23:26:38 "Causing major disruptions to oil and gas production in the Gulf even before its arrival, the storm was forecast to unleash waves as high as 14 feet (4.3 meters) above normal sea levels in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said."
271 2018-10-10 23:26:05 Calcium to replace oil craze?
272 2018-10-10 23:26:03 Bread and olive oil
273 2018-10-10 23:26:01 Not a PhD, but I would love to be involved and would be happy to discuss upstream oil and gas issues with you and your team.  There is a high demand for safety critical assisted decision making in the industry.  Perhaps opportunity for collaboration and data sharing?
274 2018-10-10 23:25:36 Ahhhh sorry I missed #zerowastehour I was doing an mad dash for coconut oil on the outskirts of town. I go through a lot of it making soap!

276 2018-10-10 23:25:02 how many tbsp the pack say u need sometimes i wouldnt put the full amount in medicated oil cause u can lowkey taste that shit i put like a qp in a lb of oil if i remember right
277 2018-10-10 23:24:58 Is protection of our coastline from oil drilling a liberal position?  Is improving the education system in SC a liberal position?  If so then maybe you should  embrace it.
278 2018-10-10 23:24:49 Looks pretty normal, consistent with most things I cook in it, just have to scrub off the seasonings and oil. I'm probably gonna let it soak in some soapy water
279 2018-10-10 23:24:41 righhtttt. I was looking forward to getting some ramen while I waited for my oil change, but I just had viet food.
280 2018-10-10 23:24:39 @RepRickLarsen Is this your plan? I'm sorry, it might be a little too radical for you Your oil and gas donors will decide that right
281 2018-10-10 23:24:35 The thing I wonder is, are we seeing a rbob crack spread price destruction more than 'demand destruction'?  I mean...have you seen rbob prices lately??  $2.00 seems like a gift with all this talk of 'high oil prices'.  Meaning, there is no real 'pain at the pump'....

286 2018-10-10 23:24:03 That’s fact you smash a chick with baby oil on you or her 2/3 days later she gone swear you gave her a STD
287 2018-10-10 23:23:57 I just need an oil change ...
288 2018-10-10 23:23:37 Does it even qualify as cheese? It’s made mostly of oil...
289 2018-10-10 23:23:16 @atiku if crude oil fails today , where do we go , how do we remain financially relevant?

292 2018-10-10 23:22:57 Q I've been asked: Why is the @NoMeasureG spending $$$ if the oil industry doesn't want to frack here? 

A:  If industry doesn't want to frack here (IDK that), they're still motivated to protect the right to drill new wells. ...given that Measure G bans fracking AND new wells

295 2018-10-10 23:22:52 Thoughts on polyunsaturated fat? Told it’s bad which I agree but it’s in avacado oil, almond nuts, and I even saw it in the chicken I brought. What’s the meaning
296 2018-10-10 23:22:44 Hey now wars are fought for oil, Mr. Dictionary.
297 2018-10-10 23:22:30 Tariffs, interest rates, oil at $75, rising labor costs....the end result is a squeeze to spending power and earnings which ultimately translates to an adjustment of stock prices. It’s an inevitable part of the cycle.

299 2018-10-10 23:22:25 Please don’t use Scheer’s blatant attempt to divide the country to spread hate and contempt for Albertans. We aren’t all toiling in oil fields and farms. Some of us actually live in cities & work in climate controlled offices. In fact that’s the majority of us. Plus we voted NDP
300 2018-10-10 23:21:57 Well too bad all your credibility is literally non existent. You're the modern equivalent to the guy in 1950 saying 'Leaded gas is safe!" while pocketing a check from big oil.
301 2018-10-10 23:21:51 I'm so fucking done with my job like I had a coworker called me to ask me to cover a shift for tomorrow and I said no cause I did an appointment for an oil change on my car at 3 and this fucking prick said can you change that for another day
302 2018-10-10 23:21:37 Interestingly, even oil and coal companies now ply their expertise in routinely building solar and wind to power their own operations. For them, the economic sense is in not using their own supply to power themselves. Some oil powers are following suit on the national level.

322 2018-10-10 23:19:08 We were fed disinformation by the oil companies. They’ve known for decades that this change was happening but they lied, just like the cigarette companies. 

When you follow the money, it leads you to Exxon. Grant money is a joke compared to oil money.

339 2018-10-10 23:17:00 Only if we keep going with oil, that's what the carbon tax is for. The gov't doesn't pocket it it actually get used on shit. And you'll notice that educated countries have smaller families. It's why we need immigration to keep our population up, educated women have less kids.
340 2018-10-10 23:16:59 The Ukraine has some of the richest farm land in Europe – over 1,000 miles of flat plains known as steppes. It also has rich supplies of oil and gas. #GodsPrayerRoom

343 2018-10-10 23:16:54 How are you lifting us up by supporting laws that allow drilling on reserves, lifting carbon emissions restrictions, reinstating Ocean drilling? It seems to me who you really want to life up is Big Oil and the fossil fuel industry.
344 2018-10-10 23:16:54 There are no "lucrative" oil sands profits, it's a project kept alive with billions of taxpayers dollars, as it's sold at a loss! If it were any other business, it would have been folded up years ago, with an abandoned building as its legacy!

351 2018-10-10 23:15:59 You've hit the nail on the head. I asked Cenovus if they wanted a carbon tax in AB because their heavy crude oil would already be decarbonized by the time China etc imposes downstream carbon pricing. "Absolutely," he said. Ctax as a competitive advantage, anyone?

357 2018-10-10 23:15:24 When the price of a barrel of oil goes up they raise the prices in about 2 seconds flat.

When the price of a barrel of oil goes down it takes the gas prices months to go down.

Then we get the bi-annual blend change (summer/winter) that mysteriously creates its own gas shortage.

409 2018-10-10 23:08:59 Few years ago they started trading in their own currencies. China needs russian oil. Stopped using US Dollars as the World Reserve Currency.
NEOCONS have been pushing for War with Russian and that is forcing them into bed with China.
410 2018-10-10 23:08:49 Exactly...oil, eggs and seasoning!!!
411 2018-10-10 23:08:30 First, the government isn’t requiring E15. Simply updating regulation to allow access to it year-round as a choice for consumers. Second, one of the reasons the RFS was put in place bc oil companies were blocking access to ethanol. RFS provides fair mkt access.
412 2018-10-10 23:07:59 Fill in the blank! New Mexico is the __ largest oil producer in the country!
413 2018-10-10 23:07:57 The people are being starved by US sanctions. Venezuela has the worlds largest OIL reserves. This is nothing more than the US wanting regime change for OIL. Just like Iraq, Libya, Syria.....
414 2018-10-10 23:07:43 Where you grab the beard wash and oil from bro?
415 2018-10-10 23:07:28 Not that I’m aware of. Learned the hard way and put CBD oil in a nicotine vape. My taste buds still have not forgiven me.

417 2018-10-10 23:07:08 All they have are thoughts and prayers. Their very clear goal is to protect the short term profits of major contributors at the harm of long term security.  I.E. gun manufacturers, ammo makers, oil companies, insurance companies, etc...

I'm ashamed to have ever belonged to GoP.

420 2018-10-10 23:06:58 It’s always someone else’s fault. They said part of the reason was high oil prices. So wouldn’t that be because of his policies.
421 2018-10-10 23:06:46 More lies from trump he just DOES NOT CARE about hurricane victims having people applaud for him and buy his snake oil much more important than running the country
422 2018-10-10 23:06:40 Rubbing peppermint oil directly on my stomach(like right under my rib cage, and lower abdomen) always help me, I have severe anxiety! Definetly cant hurt to give it try!
423 2018-10-10 23:06:37 I've always been irked by his "No Pipelines" stance while forgetting to mention his railroad moves the oil that would have gone into said pipeline at a significant profit & much greater environmental & safety risk.
424 2018-10-10 23:06:37 Oil market has still in no way come to grips with the fact that we lose the equivalent of Iran each year from here forward due to a steepening decline curve.
425 2018-10-10 23:06:37 Undoubtedly the most corrupt politician in Dallas. This is nothing in comparison to everything he's done and gotten away with over the years.
426 2018-10-10 23:06:35 The Oilers just suck. Pretty well the start and end of it. Nothing, not even the best player in the world can change it.
427 2018-10-10 23:06:21 lemme give u some cocunut oil for those lmao
428 2018-10-10 23:06:14 The oil industry is the #1 problem in the world. It is estimated to be more than 50% of all carbon emissions. Everything revolves around gas so try to do less of everything. Sounds silly but yeah. Did you buy something from amazon? cost gas to get it delivered to you.

I spent some time last night to browse #OOTT thread. Most tweets are news or retweets. Those tweets are interesting but to be honest, I don't know how they can help me make a profit by incorporating them in the trading of #USOil.
430 2018-10-10 23:06:03 Ginger ale, pho. At some point I’ll end up making jook and eating it with soy sauce and sesame oil (and sriracha, if I have a cold).
431 2018-10-10 23:05:58 Oil cleansers are the best. I’ll text you and explain why
432 2018-10-10 23:05:57 HA! Have you read the latest UN report on climate change? A huge problem & none of the answers include oil rigs off Florida’s coast! In fact, we have 11 years - 11 years!!! - to limit a climate change catastrophe. It’s time to convert fossil fuel energy to renewable green energy.
433 2018-10-10 23:05:56 Based on the results of the last two seasons and the moves that have been made, they are likely a bubbling playoff team that needs their superstar to carry them & goalie to be a top 10 guy. For me, that's a .500ish team and makes that a reasonable target for October.
434 2018-10-10 23:05:51 Do any of you ever feel like trying to find time and energy to pursue creative goals is like drowning in crude oil filled with walruses trying to pull you to the bottom of a well while other people are saying how wonderful the walrus oil well is?
435 2018-10-10 23:05:50 John I said earlier that no one sane would have declared the season a success if the Oil win game 1, I didn’t finish but the point is clear
436 2018-10-10 23:05:50 AVOCADO OIL IS THE SHIT
437 2018-10-10 23:05:40 Did you know that 1000 MG of garlic oil 3 times per day will lower your LDL .it’s slow but it does the job .
438 2018-10-10 23:05:33 Also avocado toast (dont laugh) is actually really freakin good and worth eating. You can mash it or cut it into slices depending on its ripeness. add salt and pepper to it. And put it on french bread lightly toasted in olive oil.

440 2018-10-10 23:04:57 PM says oil prices have hit 90$ per barrel whereas yesterday Brent crude is at 74$ per barrel.
441 2018-10-10 23:04:50 I love the Mongongo oil collection. It leaves my hair soft and manageable
442 2018-10-10 23:04:41 Funny how a country with such a vast amount of natural resources namely oil is so opposed by the Americans that’s its crashing their economy . Who would have thought where there’s lots of oil America would want regime change . It’s just such a coincidence isn’t it Iran Venezuela
443 2018-10-10 23:04:29 @Oil_Drop Unrealistic expectations are fed during every training camp. It's easy to be enthusiastic when players are fresh and all are undefeated. Fans, IMO, read far too much into optimistic yarns about this new kid or that returning vet or the end of all slumps.

Been crushing some star anise and mixing it with hot water, leaving it on a radiator for weeks, and it just keeps on giving, bringing happy memories; my favourite, heaven scent.

453 2018-10-10 23:02:59 Shared resources, unfortunately lots of times even in more capitalist countries, are owned by the government. But even municipalities sue polluters all the time, one near where I live sued an oil company for polluting a river on behalf of those hurt. the company cleaned it up.
454 2018-10-10 23:02:55 cow flatulence from meat farming contributes roughly 7% of the world’s total carbon emissions. OIL AND CARBON-CONSUMING INDUSTRY CAUSES OVER SEVENTY PERCENT. fuck telling individuals what to do.

460 2018-10-10 23:02:22 Not that damn oil !
461 2018-10-10 23:02:21 He's *supposed* to be the revenue generating guy. He made the call to keep the two idiots and he's the guy that was part of their hiring process. They need to fix that if he stays around.

476 2018-10-10 23:00:07 Based on the results of the 2017-18 season and the moves made in the offseason are  playoff truely realistic expectation?

Can they make the post season? Yes

Will they make it? Who knows that’s why they play the game.

Should be expect it? No, not based on the team assembled

Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

We're still facing the same issues almost 1/2 century later.

When will they learn?
482 2018-10-10 22:59:42 Tragically, this’ll end up in the “keeping up appearances” file.  This administration, and those before it, to be fair, have had exceptional opportunity (Yemen tragedies) to take the Saudis to task, and they have not.  Bring on the coup de grâce of US/Saudi oil uncoupling, I say.
483 2018-10-10 22:59:19 If I happen to be around after the Oil Wars, I'll probably be looking for something with better gas mileage, but maybe that's just me.

485 2018-10-10 22:59:05 Turned out pretty well! Dredged in flour, egg, then the crumbs. Baked on lightly greased (with olive oil) parchment lined baking sheet.
486 2018-10-10 22:58:38 Well the good thing about the markets dropping today is oil prices dropped to a little over $72 a barrel, so we should see a small decrease in gas prices.
487 2018-10-10 22:58:38 Or just a collection of Trump clips about promoting oil and coal opposite FL hurricane footage. When the history of this era is written, how often will the word "lemmings" be used?

My husband didn't grocery shop at all during the time I was gone, but he did change the oil in my car. I think this perfectly symbolizes our marriage.

509 2018-10-10 22:56:24 If only Canada had an alternative to supplying its eastern provinces with oil that didn’t depend on buying from Saudi Arabia.

You know, a homegrown alternative that would create jobs and boost the economy in the process and NOT fund human rights abuses.

*glares*
510 2018-10-10 22:56:18 Doesn't that mean Trudeau is Trump too? I mean Trudeau has adopted Harper's shitty CO2 emission targets, Saudi deal, corporate tax cuts, love for oil pipelines, stance on electoral reform, ignorance of FN issues etc.

515 2018-10-10 22:56:05 @tvcnewsng There are several areas to generate income aside Crude Oil, but Nigeria  has refuse to look into other areas like tourism and the likes. If  Nigeria can invest deeply on other sectors #JH
516 2018-10-10 22:56:03 I have a friend who got a job working for an LP. he said they rate their weed A to D grade and the ABCs go to oil and as dried flower and the D grade (bugs and mold) gets ground up and goes in the pre-rolls because it's been irradiated
517 2018-10-10 22:56:01 You’re wrong. Did you really go to law school? And you think THAT’S the definition of false?  I hope you at least got a free oil change with that law degree. It’d be a shame if it was total waste.

Together they made $28B - From Putin - who was pressed for cash. Oil prices were sinking, US sanctions due to Crimea

528 2018-10-10 22:54:22 I am with you there oil (99% fat), processed food is bad. Overconsumption of fructose might also not be that beneficial. Still you have the carcinogens that comes with meat and the activation of igf 1 in animal protein, which is bad.

530 2018-10-10 22:54:20 Reading today about such things as judges being linked to having interests in oil firms and fracking etc., then jailed those who demonstrated, proves yet again that this country is just as corrupt as those countries we are warned about. Disgusting! Has it always been like this?
531 2018-10-10 22:54:01 Psssst. Here’s a little known fact for you: subsidizing oil companies and farmers is socialism.

534 2018-10-10 22:53:29 @SenJohnBarrasso Removing the federal tax credit for electric vehicles will hurt the cause of climate change and make it easier for the Chinese to enter the market. I also noted that one of your major contributors is oil and gas which makes this decision all the more suspect.
535 2018-10-10 22:53:18 Today 700,000 might be without natural gas with Enbridge's pipeline explosion in BC and Irving's refinery explosion just happened in New Brunswick and now #HurricaneMichael threatens 20% of US oil supplies. Maybe it's a sign it's time to create local energy beyond fossil fuels.
536 2018-10-10 22:53:14 Actually, EE downstream emissions were exactly the issue.
Also, all oil smells.

For "clean", as in CO2, the dirtiest oil comes from California. You're still the idiot "sweets".
537 2018-10-10 22:53:12 Will you be discussing the findings in the report:

542 2018-10-10 22:52:38 Además, una parte del gas se usa para generar electricidad. Si cobran el gas muy caro, conviene usar fuel oil. Así que tampoco se pueden hacer los tontos.
En resumen, la hago corta, desde que asumió Macri y el vasco vivillo, cobraron por arriba del precio de mercado.
543 2018-10-10 22:52:26 Hey Sierra club, how much funding are you taking from the US special interests & political action committees? Why aren't you protesting land based oil sales to the US from Canada or oil shipments into Canada from the US? Why only focused on the oil that hurts Canada's economics?
544 2018-10-10 22:51:40 Transmutation: 
Grapes must be crushed to make wine. Diamonds r formed under pressure. Olives are pressed to make oil. Seeds are grown in darkness. Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you're in a powerful place of transformation and transmutation.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
546 2018-10-10 22:51:16 That's because "American" cheese isn't really cheese at all. It's a big blob of orange fat soaked in oil and... Oh wait...
547 2018-10-10 22:51:16 My GF makes a dynamite sauce: 
ginger, soy, red pepper, salt, sugar or honey, olive oil, rice wine, sesame oil, & water...
Served with thinly cut ginger & a good hunk of tuna
548 2018-10-10 22:51:10 The oil needs to be kept in the ground anyway or we're all toast... Their relevance ends in 5-10 years, their assets will likely end up seized by the world community as reparations...?
549 2018-10-10 22:51:08 Today me dad told me he can’t wait for me to get married so he doesn’t have to remind me to get an oil change anymore

Most people cannot read blueprints but they may think chart reading is no big deal because there are only 2 types of candles, green and red. The issue is the blank area to the right is what we have to read and this is a very big deal!
551 2018-10-10 22:51:00 they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place
552 2018-10-10 22:50:47 I take 2200mg of fish oil with high amount of EPA (1400mg) along with 100 mg of Phosphatidyl Serine twice a day and it really helps me a lot. Both doc recommended. 

he also recommended exercise and meditation but i have been very bad at those
553 2018-10-10 22:50:38 You guys always seem to forget, plastic is made from oil. What are you going to make your precious cell phones, and computers out of? Not to mention the vast amount of things made out of plastic.
554 2018-10-10 22:50:35 But personally I would prefer nuclear to oil and gas
555 2018-10-10 22:50:31 I swear by chopping garlic and steeping it in hot olive oil, then straining and dribbling into the ear while still warm.
556 2018-10-10 22:50:09 Yup. #gymjordan has the integrity of a snake oil salesman. What happened with the Ohio State wrestling program during his time there still needs to be investigated too.
557 2018-10-10 22:49:39 Key word being BOE....how much oil?
558 2018-10-10 22:49:38 Getting oil change now. Got nothin but time. Where are you now? Back in Russia ? Come on let’s have some fun.
559 2018-10-10 22:49:30 Looking like a damn oil spill cleanup scrubbing crude off a duck
560 2018-10-10 22:49:27 @FranzFanon1863 pulling out Iran Deal is not going to help oil price
561 2018-10-10 22:49:23 It’s beard oil
562 2018-10-10 22:49:11 Going back to FDR. Saudis are indispensable to US interests and Oil resources. Does not matter who the President is at the time
563 2018-10-10 22:49:07 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
564 2018-10-10 22:49:06 I tried Zoloft for 4 days earlier this year, and it made me feel much more anxious than before. So I took control of my mental health in other ways, like cutting caffeine, taking ashwagandha & CBD oil, making workouts less intense, & tapping into my calling.
565 2018-10-10 22:49:04 Any chance we can simplify this into sources. Petrol, diesel, oil, gas, refrigerants and I suppose cow’s farts. Then draw a line from 100% @2019 to hee-haw of each by say 2040 and check each year how they are all going. #simples
566 2018-10-10 22:48:52 PSA: if you drive a moped around please know that you need to stick to the right or left side of the lane.  Just like a motorcycle, mopeds lose traction in the middle of the lane due to the oil slick.  Conditions are worse when it is raining or wet.  Stay safe out there Tigers!
567 2018-10-10 22:48:51 Because he's a snake oil salesman. 
568 2018-10-10 22:48:28 Garlic and oil with chicken my FAVVVVVVV
569 2018-10-10 22:48:22 And I respectfully disagree with you that our government has "cost untold jobs and damaged the economy in general." Low oil prices and a recession did that quite spectacularly. Our government chose to address our infrastructure debt, which was way worse, and keep people working.
570 2018-10-10 22:48:19 Avitas oil cartridges are 20% off today! #GETWOWED
571 2018-10-10 22:48:05 @windiejo hey Windie just saw the documentary you were in Sex & oil city. I’m sorry for what happened to you but so proud of you at the same time. Keep up the good work. May Allah bless you I’ll remember you in my prayers that you achieve everything in life.

573 2018-10-10 22:47:54 oil & gas had a media plan and money to burn . we had science and a voice  but no plan .

579 2018-10-10 22:47:07 How about banning oil drilling and fighting for 100% renewable energy? You know, things that actually work? @scottwyman954
580 2018-10-10 22:47:00 need to restock my bio oil.
581 2018-10-10 22:46:52 Obama is a Satanic Illuminati Witch--which is kinda cool actually! Kill people! Burn shit! Fuck school! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
582 2018-10-10 22:46:45 Castor oil! It works miracles
583 2018-10-10 22:46:40 Just answered a telephone survey from the oil and gas industry (I'm pretty sure) that was so poorly designed that I could not give different answers for oil, natural gas, and renewables. #fail

585 2018-10-10 22:46:35 He began the restoration on the basis that Zionists would tear it down. That became the war-cry for the pogrom of 1919 and thereafter, to mobilise the Arab street to attack Jews. Money flowed in from the oil revenues and not only did Husseini become a very rich man.
586 2018-10-10 22:46:24 Use a few drops of oregano oil in a glass of water- it works wonders!  Feel better, @melisa_jaquez .
587 2018-10-10 22:45:47 #MentalHealthAwarenessDay man has day off, after taking wife to work, decides to service the car, new brake pads, oil change & oil filter, checked the tyres, sorts the lock on the door that was damaged by being slammed, wife comes home and complains dishes haven't been done
588 2018-10-10 22:45:31 I dont think economy has peaked, i think growth has peaked: back to 2.2%. I think dollar has peaked and oil has peaked. I think 10 year bonds have peaked, and we will see fed stop raising rates shortly.
589 2018-10-10 22:45:28 THE SPECTRE OF DEATH TO THE PETRO-DOLLAR! China has sent a signal to the united states that it could start by weanig itself off US oil, leaving the US in fear and wondering: suppose they one day pay with the RMB? Fear for the dollar is likely going to soften the Americans
590 2018-10-10 22:45:22 Well he's just the revenue generating overseer, but with all the belt tightening not just with the Oilers but all the Katz investments around there if he's maybe on the hot seat too. It's a private co so we'll likely never know
591 2018-10-10 22:45:19 Peppermint oil!!! It always helps when my anxiety comes around and my stomach problems come up!
592 2018-10-10 22:45:16 .500 being best case is sad. The best case in people’s minds should be to get on a winning streak. Instead, we are so conditioned to loosing that this team going close to .500 in a league with a loser point is considered a best case senario by some.
593 2018-10-10 22:45:15 So apparently there’s a new “oil free” trend in food rn and I’ll I’m saying is if you think I’m ever letting go of my olive oil fuck right off
594 2018-10-10 22:45:10 1 answer to everything. Oil prices and inability of past admin to diversify our source of revenue. Buhari only fault was nit allowing the market control exchange rates. But everything you put here, buhari also suffered it
595 2018-10-10 22:45:09 Hard work and determination truly pays off. Looking great! Keep up the good work. 
596 2018-10-10 22:45:04 Well, then palm oil is also delicious. :-(
597 2018-10-10 22:45:03 about to play a prank on Elma involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
598 2018-10-10 22:45:02 Chick-fil-A: here’s your meal sir, I also noticed your car needs an oil change would you like some help with that?
599 2018-10-10 22:45:00 Eating more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil, and other healthy foods while eating less unhealthy junk and processed foods can be an effective treatment strategy for depression. #4Mind4Body #MHM2018

600 2018-10-10 22:44:59 I also think I need some cooking oil for these waffle fries.
601 2018-10-10 22:44:47 @SenJohnBarrasso I see you wish to eliminate the tax credit for EVs, AND tax them for using the highway? I’ll support you if you include eliminating ALL TAX CREDITS for the Oil and Gas Industry. I’d call that fair. Perhaps the Gulf of Mexico will cool down so we don’t get Cat 4s?
602 2018-10-10 22:44:44 And the quote of the day was " I can't believe you called me a Witch just because I put some flowers in oil"...  =P
603 2018-10-10 22:44:40 @POTUS Please try to get the oil moguls to lower the price of gasoline for our cars?  Winter is coming to the north and gas is close to 3.50 a gallon and climbing....that would be a winner on your side, although you are doing terrific in my eyes!!
604 2018-10-10 22:44:33 UCP says oil and gas is only important! Get rid of 20% of those dogs! Hire Soldiers of Odin instead i guess lol lol lol. Wildrose 2.0 at its best!!!!
605 2018-10-10 22:44:19 Dearest Dumbf*cks,
It is NOT natural to have “The Storm of the Century” every other month, despite what the Big Oil crisis actors in the @GOP say.

606 2018-10-10 22:44:09 I am really being THAT person who comes in last minute when the store is fixing to close ... but I needed an oil change BAD

608 2018-10-10 22:44:02 You are spot on, Joanna Kay Gowans!  So much of our money wasted. Ruminating this morning about the huge subsidies given annually by govt to oil and gas (and a bit to renewables) which only fuels global warming--and if they do decide to do something about it, we'll pay. Sigh.
609 2018-10-10 22:43:50 In all honesty, an oil change is something everyone should learn how to do. Just like changing a tire. It's simple and a lot cheaper to do yourself.

612 2018-10-10 22:43:45 Because she pointed out the "logic" or lack there of. It's 2018, and people are still buying snake oil.
613 2018-10-10 22:43:27 Didn' THEY say that about Advanced Gascooled Reactors.  I worked on a lifting frame for a cooling pump fluid coupling on one as a student engineer.
You know your old when things like that (and oil platforms) have been made redundant and dismantled.
614 2018-10-10 22:43:25 What caused our recession isn't it the decline in oil price? Come on guys let's be realistic here our biggest economic problem as a country is over dependence on oil.
615 2018-10-10 22:43:05 Zatarans makes a blackened seasoning that is OFF THE METERS. Garlic powder, onion powder and some of that seasoning. Sear it in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil and make some mashed potatoes from scratch with a Hawaiian roll and you are winning sis!

619 2018-10-10 22:42:33 How do you over tighten an oil filter? Did you use an oil filter wrench or did you just muscle the damn thing with your fingers and teeth?
620 2018-10-10 22:42:25 Oil is not only the problem it's also our only solution. If runaway-greenhouse-effect has begun, simply not-polluting & resulting mass human die-off back to 1700's population levels wont even save us. We need industrial-strength co2 Air Capture tech- the kind only oil can buy.
621 2018-10-10 22:42:22 Bruh I went in for a oil change.....
622 2018-10-10 22:42:18 Frozen berries, frozen mango, 1 or 2 bananas (ripe af,) greens (I prefer kale,) protein powder (I use pea protein,) green powder (I like barley grass powder or mixed greens powder,) nut butter, flax seed oil, cinnamon, turmeric, hemp/chia seeds, plant milk. BOOM. Insta ready.

625 2018-10-10 22:41:45 need to replace the rotors or have them machined smooth again. They're ripping you off on the engine oil flush. It's just a product you buy at autozone or wherever that you add to your engine and run for 10 mins prior to a regular oil change. And an engine flush is seldom needed.
626 2018-10-10 22:41:44 Sweets, are you saying that Alberta oil sands are the cleanest fuels burning?  That it isn't smelly?  Now who's the idiot?  Energy East Downstream emissions had nothing to do with the Carbon Tax.  Please learn facts.

637 2018-10-10 22:40:11 US governments plan 4 being energy independent is totally BS. Now that law has been repealed that prohibited US oil from being exported, we export more oil than we import. All for benefit of private oil companies profits at the expense of our clean water.

663 2018-10-10 22:36:50 Sounds like the oil lobby
664 2018-10-10 22:36:48 There is no more oil Heather. It’s worthless gunge and all gone.
665 2018-10-10 22:36:31 For a place that still cuts heads and hands off for crimes or stone people I would say that is big yes! Only reason anyone tolerates this brutal regime is because of oil which makes us accomplices.
666 2018-10-10 22:36:17 Reading between the lines you find fracking isn't economical below a certain price - anyone with any economic sense knows that, yet as oil prices rise it becomes economical to frack & explore - that's the history of the oil & gas industry. Implying it's not profitable is disinfo
667 2018-10-10 22:36:08 Oil change and windows tinted! My girl looks shnice
668 2018-10-10 22:36:08 Yes and no. Mkt works in advance. So in 2010ish and for years, Mkt rallied anticipating an economic recovery. Now, with 3.7% unemployment, overheated tax cuts, global uncertainty, tariffs, oil and rising rates, the Mkt looks like it’s trying to tell us the economy has peaked.
669 2018-10-10 22:36:05 Thanks to the increase in oil price not @MBuhari isn't it clear that we are toast without oil?
670 2018-10-10 22:36:02 Remember when it was a big concern whether or not we'd run out of fossil fuels, not whether we'd live to do so? Renewable energy was all about not running out of oil

673 2018-10-10 22:35:24 I’ll PM you the oil I end up getting, it’s from the vitamin shop here in corpus next to the Starbucks on staples.
674 2018-10-10 22:35:11 Some girls use makeup, but I bet you have to touch yourself up with oil paints when you start to blur since you're a walking piece of art
675 2018-10-10 22:35:02 CBD oil is totally safe and legal blaze you'll be fine and I'm sure it'll really help with those ouchies
676 2018-10-10 22:34:58 Lemon Kale Chips 

1 large bunch kale, washed and torn into bite-size pieces
2 tbs. olive oil
2 drops Lemon essential oil
Salt & pepper

Wash and dry kale thoroughly.
Combine olive oil and Lemon oil in large mixing bowl.

Once kale is coated, place on baking sheet. 200° F 50 min
677 2018-10-10 22:34:56 what’s the point of making a oil change appointment if they’re gonna let walk-ins get their cars done before they even start on mine???
678 2018-10-10 22:34:55 I can’t remember the name that use in my vaporizer . But I just make sure it’s thc free. It works wonders! Anxiety gets under control and my hand pains have been gone. I am gonna try an oil that you drop under the tongue next.
679 2018-10-10 22:34:47 We are in a war to save democracy. WE need warriors to tell Folks that GOP cut billions out of FEMA to our kids in cages. Who pays the billions in damages! Us. Why not the Oil companies, Kochs who bribe GOP to ignite climate change?

685 2018-10-10 22:33:47 If you say you support the oil and gas sector, you should explain what that means. What are the issues? What would you do differently? Etc. Have to say, "everyone has a right to their opinion and I support the resource sector" is a real nothing burger. Oh, and FOS. Oy vey.
686 2018-10-10 22:33:21 Yes the free world you created with the free labor force ie slavery on a land you took over and killed the previous residents of and with the money of the gold/oil you stole from other continents such as Africa and Asia with talents of the immigrants you sold the AmericanDream to
687 2018-10-10 22:33:19 Tell that to the people still making &10-12 hr,working three jobs and having no healthcare..Economy is good for the rich...not for the working class...Gas/oil prices up...interest rates up, cost of goods up by 20-40%, building material up 30%, businesses going under..
688 2018-10-10 22:33:11 Temperature could be too high. Or you may not be leaving the chicken in the oil long enough. Could be a combination of both lol

690 2018-10-10 22:32:55 I was agreeing with you the dems are dirty too. The fact that we can only name ONE person who was against the war lets you know how greedy they all are for oil.
691 2018-10-10 22:32:49 @feministcanuck @globeandmail and yet, you're trying to build a pipeline for the dirtiest oil on the planet. #Liar #Hypocrite

698 2018-10-10 22:32:14 Since they just upped their oil output for you, I assume your probe won't go much further than this 'demand' .. let's see
699 2018-10-10 22:32:13 @byrnedairystore  oil change overdue. Get to it!!!
700 2018-10-10 22:32:06 what’s bio oil?

707 2018-10-10 22:31:12 we're seeing it in the production of palm oil, illegal deforestation in Mexico making way for avocado farming, hugely damaging shipping of tons of foreign grains, horrific misuse of pesticides- veganism could be a wonderful solution, but not within an ideological framework (1/2)
708 2018-10-10 22:31:11 Let me think, Iran agreement suspended, price of crude oil increases which benefits who? Russia and Saudi Arabia.
709 2018-10-10 22:31:09 Bought organic rosehip oil and it’s burning my face
710 2018-10-10 22:31:08 And again, money and power taht are usually concentrated on individuals. If you can’t 100% show that the benefit of investing on huge amounts on electoral politics benefit THE COMMUNITY someone is part of... then you are a snake oil salesman
711 2018-10-10 22:30:57 Aust is the only import oil dependant country in the international energy agency that has not imposed any stockholding obligation. So we have 20 days of petrol. I9 days aviation fuel. This is pathetic
712 2018-10-10 22:30:57 DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN. Open side cover oil will come out but it’s easier to check tension when u can see what’s happening. That stupid 1 2/3 turns & back off is ridiculous. I’ve been into my case 2x this year. Once the sprocket came undone and 2nd overtight chain & bolt snapped.

It's been 8 years since and I never spoke to that woman again but I'll remember this forever.
715 2018-10-10 22:30:51 Oil in the ground isn't an issue 

By products of burning it is.
716 2018-10-10 22:30:44 Interesting day.
Maybe cashing out? Same profit taking in oil?
717 2018-10-10 22:30:40 Yes, and they want to remain British... meanwhile the Argentinians are aware of the potential very rich oil and gas reserves associated with the island.
718 2018-10-10 22:30:31 interesting but why is there no mention on oil prices and (linked) treasury yields? anyway, we hope for the buybacks steps.

721 2018-10-10 22:30:19 I'm happy to learn about your alternative plans to address climate change.

But you don't have any so I'll go with the plan that is proven to work. 

And if its "crushing the energy sector" why are oil and gas production at record high levels?

723 2018-10-10 22:30:12 Saudis are like @realDonaldTrump, they do whatever they want with impunity. Most 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, we went to war with Iraq. What a joke of a price we pay for oil.
724 2018-10-10 22:30:10 If #Submarines had porn this would be the tasteful oil painting version :) I want to take this class lol
725 2018-10-10 22:30:05 We need to arrest the Kochs for bribing GOP. We need to arrest the Trump EPA. This is climate change-this will get worse. Kochs make billions destroying planet and tax payers foot bill. Send invoice to Oil companies @SenateDems
726 2018-10-10 22:30:00 おさようござりまふ～！
727 2018-10-10 22:29:59 I doubt there are real consequences for KSA. Maybe a wrist slap at most. Trump would not tolerate $100+ oil that might come about by imposing a cost on the Saudis.
728 2018-10-10 22:29:40 True. Regime change in Iran will align it with USA. More oil.
729 2018-10-10 22:29:37 I should get some of that!!! I’m trying to figure out when to put them on. I’ve been doing rosehip before bed and I wake up and my skin looks great. And then bio oil I just put on my scars in the am.

732 2018-10-10 22:29:09 Thank you. Hopefully you’re right, and between their website and Idaho Public Television, the meeting can be cobbled togwther. I don’t have a lot of faith in their concern for the citizens of the state, when at least 2 of the members have personal oil and gas interest

734 2018-10-10 22:28:59 This white man Dump his kids in the oil tank, and buried his wife.... damn that’s crazy.
735 2018-10-10 22:28:43 POTUS has the absolute right of commenting on FED Chairman Jerome Powell for raising interests rates. Think of the US economy as a rubber band being stretched on 1 side by HIGHER interests rates & the other side by HIGHER oil prices!! This rubber band will SNAP when both

743 2018-10-10 22:27:59 So in your opinion, Saudi helped Yemen when it annexed Najran, Jizan and Asir in 1934, assassinated President Ibrahim al-Hamdi in 1977, installed Ali Abdullah Saleh as its puppet few years after and began tapping Yemen's oil in Al-Jawf and Marib?

Doesn't exactly look like "help"
744 2018-10-10 22:27:37 That is a big fat lie. This could potentially  a loan from the big end of town Super funds, Banks and Oil Search.
745 2018-10-10 22:27:23 Great idea nobody will ever buy almonds ever again once they see the water volumes required. Or palm oil products that deprive us of magnificent diversity
746 2018-10-10 22:27:09 And you are a climate denier, and vote against the violence against women act. I am less concerned about oil then I am about human beings. I would’ve expected you would be as well but clearly it’s about money.

749 2018-10-10 22:26:31 @TYTNetwork #TYTLIVE Saudi oil reserves have been down for a decade plus, King stopped land exploration, began offshore projects, then tapped Yemen for reserves and has neg. cashflow. Rich but going broke.
750 2018-10-10 22:26:28 Yeah
751 2018-10-10 22:26:26 @cenkuygur Could the Republicans stance on this have anything to do with oil? #tytlive
752 2018-10-10 22:26:15 Oil oil and more oil.
753 2018-10-10 22:26:13 Someone tell Trump that Saudi Arabia has a lot of oil, wait don’t we don’t need another war #tytlive

755 2018-10-10 22:26:07 Did you notice how he sat at his desk with his arms folded answering the question? The journalist is probably in an oil barrel or was bound and moved out in the black van and boarded on the plane, 1 of 2, that was there so coincidentally. And I don't believe in coincidence.

759 2018-10-10 22:25:44 You hear Musk, he sounds like a guy who'd suck his dick 24/7/365 if he could, big oil provides quality of life and takes all the blame even tho they just extract the thing, we're the ones burning it for quality of life
760 2018-10-10 22:25:33 I think because agricultural emissions are secondary petrochemical pollution. That is to say, the carbon footprint of a kg of beef is related to oil consumption in its feedstock production, transportation, refrigeration— not methane emissions from the animal.
761 2018-10-10 22:25:27 ie olive oil, fresh eggs

777 2018-10-10 22:23:38 The uk benefits from oil tax revenues not oil sales. It cost more to extract oil and more to pay for decommissioning old fields. There has been no oil tax revenues for the last 3 years so oil is worth nothing to the uk or an independent Scotland as it stands.
778 2018-10-10 22:23:27 Coñiaso LMFAOO NOT THAT TYPE OF OIL
779 2018-10-10 22:23:09 $TESLAQ is near,gotta admit I always hated bigoil,tho I was always skeptical about tesla.But Musk is making it very easy not to dislike big oil that much,big oil gives you quality of life and puts the steak in the plate and STFU also musk loves it too, got on his knees with Saudi
780 2018-10-10 22:23:09 Roger. You are aware that virtually all large oil producers are pro-carbon tax and want above all else certainty. Right?
781 2018-10-10 22:23:09 We should stop buying Saudi oil. Saudi Arabia still crucifies people. Sickening. #cdnpoli

798 2018-10-10 22:20:53 The progressive fascists like to call it their War on Oil. They’re against hard work, they just had their nails and eyebrows done.
799 2018-10-10 22:20:44 is that better? i buy coconut oil in 5 gallon drums (really i do, but my co-op splits it, i use 2 gallons every 6 months)
800 2018-10-10 22:20:43 Somehow, that just seems wrong to me, as wrong indigenous Canadians or native Americans blessing an oil pipeline, or anyone blessing a pipeline for that matter.
801 2018-10-10 22:20:28 Ever have any conversations with families of  victims of illegal aliens that shouldn't be in the country to begin with?
802 2018-10-10 22:20:26 Adi agbon is actually coconut oil. Adi is majorly used to describe oil/extract gotten from something else I think, hence the name.
803 2018-10-10 22:20:18 Because it’s unsafe, uncomfortable and impractical. And your cleaning bill to remove road grime and oil would be horrendous.
804 2018-10-10 22:20:16 What cracks me up is the right saying it’s not man made. Don’t they realize oil and gas are finite commodities. We’re going to have to come up with alternative energy anyway. So, who cares who’s fault it is.

817 2018-10-10 22:18:43 Wait, isn’t that $100 oil? Oh, it’s the opposite?!
818 2018-10-10 22:18:43 Nope.  Those industries pay carbon tax on all the Gasoline they consume.  Shipping Nat Gas or Alberta putrid oil sands overseas, doesn't cause Canadians to consume gasoline or hydrocarbons, except in the course of doing business.  Its not hard.
819 2018-10-10 22:18:37 Who gets to own the water and profit from it? Right now, the ruling class

Who gets to own the oil and profit from it? Same.

Why is putting *average people* in charge of our own lives such a bad thing?

It's us, the 99.99% versus the 0.01% ruling class. No?
820 2018-10-10 22:18:27 Please see sense @SenJohnBarrasso - how is this reasonable? Show strong leadership and stand up to the lobbyists from #oil and #gas. Please. There is no future in them. If you think there is, then there is no future for humanity.
821 2018-10-10 22:18:24 Burned tf out myself with oil
822 2018-10-10 22:18:14 But there is no oil left that can be extracted at a rate that provides enough tax revenue for Scotland. In other words oil is worth shit and it had been for the last 3 years
823 2018-10-10 22:18:12 He’s been in a year and a half and I’m still waiting to hear him say something sensible.

For example, Tariffs, oil prices, inflation are all factors...???? 

Federal Reserve
824 2018-10-10 22:18:08 Waiting to see video of Ghoul Snake Oil Salesman @700club to start pontificating about the hurricane and mental/verbally stroking his Relig-i-Dick asking for donations because his penis farts.
825 2018-10-10 22:17:56 Will this oil work in my car and will people be happier after I have passed them? If so I give it a thumbs up.
826 2018-10-10 22:17:27 I’m not suggesting my labour is better or anything.
I’m suggesting it’s about policy.
And yes, the snp has done good things for Scotland. I’m not denying that.
The snp aren’t more left wing than corbyns labour.
Do they support nationalising water, oil and rail? We do now.
827 2018-10-10 22:17:27 Its coconut oil
828 2018-10-10 22:17:10 Piffle, you need to read international law. The oil comes under the jurisdiction of Scotland. Shame on you wanting to steal another countries wealth. Oh you are a Britnat, that is what you do
829 2018-10-10 22:17:02 cuba try palmers rosehip oil

831 2018-10-10 22:16:42 Really good. The oil especially is my fave - a staple! Mums got terribly sensitive skin and I’ve got her using it. I buy it for everyone!! X
832 2018-10-10 22:16:24 Who got a oil plug hmu
833 2018-10-10 22:16:19 If you are a colorado voter, vote YES on prop 112!!!! Prop 112 is making sure that oil and gas companies -which are on the rise in colorado- are built FURTHER away from schools, water sources, communities, etc!!!!
834 2018-10-10 22:16:10 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
835 2018-10-10 22:16:08 How many oil and gas workers are injured or killed due to H2S exposure every year? @USDOL #oilandgas #H2S #OSHA

838 2018-10-10 22:15:59 Castor oil really gave me my edges back 10x, and some lashes. 
839 2018-10-10 22:15:57 Try it with tortilla and cheese /green suace so good that's my favorite combo <3 you just add little oil fry the corn tortilla strips for a bit then add your eggies! Top with cheese and green suace
840 2018-10-10 22:15:47 If you want to be an MLA, you have a right to an informed opinion. And I don't mean informed like the climate deniers over at Friends of Science. So, what's your position on the oil sands? TMX? Do you understand the constitutional issues at play? Explain the CCIR to us, Rog.
841 2018-10-10 22:15:47 Ditch oil too!
842 2018-10-10 22:15:45 Cuts, scrapes, burns, etc.. We don’t use Neosporin, straight lavender oil!!
843 2018-10-10 22:15:40 "terrorist driven rise in the price of oil" - smh.  

Do yourself a favor and don't tune into CNBC to find out what's going on, least of all when it's bad for the ruling GOP.
844 2018-10-10 22:15:18 emissions equivalent to 2 million cars, the @WSJ reports. For shale drillers, the only other option to flaring is to reduce oil production,boosted the region's economy as well as overall UScrude output.But,it’s a chicken-egg story.Steel tariffs do prevent midstream expansion +

847 2018-10-10 22:15:05 oh and @ladysaane is also a witness of using that salt & tea tree oil..  i only knew if the tea tree i jst leard bout addn the salt method 
848 2018-10-10 22:14:53 @bradlavigne those who have poor human rights records could care less about Canada We will not take a Hard stand against Saudi Arabia or any other country that has similar Human rights recorders. Cut off Saudi Oil then Easterners would realize a need for pipelines
849 2018-10-10 22:14:46 you believe any breast to be your boiling lantern worse than an oil mounted on slips of antlers
850 2018-10-10 22:14:45 9-11 attackers were also. Saudi Arabian. That did not stop you. 3000 lives if innocent people died so your buddies and their oil has a U.S. market. You betrayed John McCain and American.
851 2018-10-10 22:14:23 Can I ask about your response when prompted about the political challenge of having to destroy jobs (eg in oil & gas)? You said we'd create other jobs instead...
852 2018-10-10 22:13:58 Stop lying. Texas energy is making billions because of your tax scam. Republicans are removing oil worker safety regulations and pollution standards. Texans live and work by refineries and it’s toxic. #VoteBetoForTexas
853 2018-10-10 22:13:46 stevia, cocoa powder, and coconut oil with just a little water to get it all mixed up...I'm missing chocolate icing so badly that I'm almost past the "bitter".

856 2018-10-10 22:13:34 I need my gma to scratch the dandruff out my scalp and oil it 
857 2018-10-10 22:13:32 an uplifting rally completely filled with lies from the worlds biggest snake oil salesman!

@czabe @team980
860 2018-10-10 22:13:08 Let's see, have all politicians pay for their health plans and no retirement lavish pensions.

Take care of these issues first before selling snake oil to the public.
861 2018-10-10 22:13:04 CBD oil, sold in stores throughout Ohio, is illegal and can carry a felony charge
862 2018-10-10 22:12:50 Not without social policy working hand in hand. Advancing tech in the hands of the ruling class will just result in more inequality, as it will always be propelled or suppressed by profit. A perfect example - oil companies squashing electric car development in the 80's and 90's.
863 2018-10-10 22:12:33 very basic tbh. just look up any Chinese noodle recipe, thick cut the noodles. Veg = green onions, 油菜, garlic and some chives; aromatics first as usual. we had extra dumpling filling so use that b4 noodles and add sesame oil+soy sauce to taste. I think I added Maggi aminos too?
864 2018-10-10 22:12:28 Even if Saudi Arabia admitted that they brutally tortured and murdered journalist #JamalKhashoggi, our government wouldn't do a thing except bend over and ask for more oil money.

#VoteBlue
865 2018-10-10 22:12:21 If you’re cooking and you put olive oil in a pan with diced onions and garlic, you’re immediately getting a blowjob from a really hot girl. Trust.
866 2018-10-10 22:11:58 You must be very bitter if you have to resort to such lies. Shetland doesn't own any oil. It's a Scottish island I'm afraid.
867 2018-10-10 22:11:56 Again misleading edit. In 2014 it was $46. Not $ 92. Right now there is a global oil price hike is going on and it will go more then $100 a barrel. N wt all u r talking with false figures?
868 2018-10-10 22:11:56 Twitter is a wagon train of sincerity and snake oil. At times, difficult to distinguish. Good night and God bless most of you. 
869 2018-10-10 22:11:54 #tytlive They say drugs make you do strange things. I say, Oil makes you do the strangest things! 
....And people won't even call you on it afterwards.
870 2018-10-10 22:11:44 They're playing a lot of good cop/bad cop games. Too much money & oil at stake to be on the outs with Saudi rulers.
871 2018-10-10 22:11:42 Yeah I have one of them I must dig it out  it’s most likely covered in suntan oil 
872 2018-10-10 22:11:36 おはようございます(*^^*)
873 2018-10-10 22:11:35 There’s oil in your head
874 2018-10-10 22:11:28 as far as oils, rosehip oil of any kind or a green tea soothing oil is rly nice, or bio oil if you have any scarring
875 2018-10-10 22:11:20 おはよ……ぼくはおねむだよ……
876 2018-10-10 22:11:16 Well the Oilers have conditioned us
877 2018-10-10 22:11:13 Exhibiting activism and displaying passion about our political beliefs are non-violent ways Americans practice our glorious right of free speech. They help put a squeak in democracy's wheel so some "oil" may be applied . . .
878 2018-10-10 22:11:13 In all seriousnes, watch oil get crushed, and the bottom will be in
879 2018-10-10 22:11:00 Popper scented oil refills? When is it coming? @Glade
880 2018-10-10 22:10:57 Yep this is the future folks as far as the eye can see, SUBSIDIES PAID for electricity. 8times the cost of nuclear,natural Gas,and coal. 8 times higher. Means in stead of paying $50.00  it will cost 400.00 when the subsidies are removed, kill oil jobs.@ABQJournal vote @Pearce4NM
881 2018-10-10 22:10:56 That video is actually footage of Kiara changing the oil in her car
882 2018-10-10 22:10:50 I think all politicians have bank accounts in the Kaman islands

Pharma, oil, gas, so on. 

Must be nice. 180,000.00 job and they have usually a 2million dollar home, another somewhere else.

And free medical for life.
883 2018-10-10 22:10:38 We're all in the same boat, the oil and gas will dry up relatively soon. And do you really think if Scotland was given independence you'd get the oil fields. You can't but a pint in Norway for under £10, imagine that in Scotland or indeed Ireland.
884 2018-10-10 22:10:23 おはありー！
885 2018-10-10 22:10:21 My dad and I were sitting in his truck and with the most serious face he said “how many miles over your oil change are you?” And I almost lied but I said 5,000 & he said “good, I’m only 3,000 over” then proceeded to lecture me on importance of oil changes 
886 2018-10-10 22:10:19 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
887 2018-10-10 22:10:16 Hash oil plug?
888 2018-10-10 22:10:05 Amen brother. Snake oil isnt even a real ingredient. Thats why I use “ Vita-Max”! They only use the freshest synthetic chemicals which havent even been around long enough for those crack pot FDA guys to test! Vita-Max! For when Yellow doesn’t taste yellow enough.
889 2018-10-10 22:10:03 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？

891 2018-10-10 22:09:54 #TYTLive I'm absolutely shocked that Chris Hayes was actually allowed to cover  this killing by his corporate masters. I thought they'd be scared to  death their oil stocks would be revoked.
892 2018-10-10 22:09:53 Many of the same unsavory folks who control our oil supply also control the FED, and the Wall Street Bankers. They are collectively known as the #NewWorldOrder. They are enraged that their puppet, HillRod, lost and they are taking it out on our @POTUS and us.
893 2018-10-10 22:09:50 First, we don't need oil from the Saudis. Second, Corker knows very little about national security/foreign policy. On the other hand, we (NSR) study it. As to what "we/the world" are going to do about it, we're helping with the investigation.
894 2018-10-10 22:09:48 Well the prevalence of cance today is clearly linked to environmental shifts caused by capitalist markets, you're engaging in Pairov's Fallacy in trying compare the pharmaceutical  industry to oil and manufacturing.

901 2018-10-10 22:09:27 Add the fact that we don’t need a drop of their oil and you’d think they would be more respectful
902 2018-10-10 22:09:26 isn't boycotting oil companies indistinguishable from reducing your personal carbon footprint?
903 2018-10-10 22:09:17 Earlier this year I finally put it together that olive oil came from olives.
904 2018-10-10 22:09:10 Every body should be out of Soybean Oil & following with trailing tight stops on Sugar & Coffee as both are reaching overbought levels. In the future as the indexes fall-so will the Dollar & put a buy-stop at 12.12 for a gold breaker-out to the upside. #Commodities #Sugar #Coffee

906 2018-10-10 22:09:09 I think he's saying he would focus the limited resources of the Sheriff's Office on saving lives. If you don't know the difference in CBD oil vs fentanyl and heroin, please drop by my office and I'll show you the obituaries that we have published over the last 10 years.
907 2018-10-10 22:09:04 Fish liver oil?
908 2018-10-10 22:08:59 Yes I've heard that all his inhereted wealth comes from oil and gas industry, 
This is similar to the drugs minister owning UKs biggest cannabis farm is showing the hipocracy of how our country is going..
909 2018-10-10 22:08:47 Again, .500 is best case scenario. Anything close and it will be keep this ship moving forward.

912 2018-10-10 22:08:26 #TimeToWakeUp @SenWhitehouse and others. We cannot just rely on government to solve the problem of #climatechange   We have to #walk and #bike more.  And not have #oil as part of our everyday life!
913 2018-10-10 22:08:26 My estimate was higher than the prof in the article, but mine was simply based on the estimated growth rates w/out oil using pre-oil population as a baseline.
914 2018-10-10 22:08:24 Looking for a CBD oil, that has both a quality product and awesome customer service? Check out Medterra.  Looked forever, so glad I found them months ago...

919 2018-10-10 22:08:02 @FLGovScott Why are you bothering with hurricane warnings when you wont pay attention to long term climate change? You and your party are in the pocket of big oil and coal whom are globally responsible for ignoring this.

925 2018-10-10 22:06:42 I just got super stoned then got a 90 min massage with CBD oil and then acupuncture right after. Damn I feel like a new person
926 2018-10-10 22:06:37 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
927 2018-10-10 22:06:37 Personally I’m a fan of the rosemary cold pressed olive oil and sea salt must be himalayan or nothing at all.

931 2018-10-10 22:06:11 Sure and if they aren’t 0.500? Is it like last year when we get told to wait until the end of the month, then wait until thanks giving, them wait until Christmas? 

Anything less than .500 and the clowns who sacrificed the assistant coaches last spring should be turfed.
932 2018-10-10 22:06:09 your oil and gas buddies will get rich but the jokes on them - climate change will kill us all
933 2018-10-10 22:06:03 Do you own an oil block?

936 2018-10-10 22:05:53 While this is oil news, this does not bode well for the US LNG projects that are counting on China as their partners or purchasers of LNG. 

Until the fog of trade war clears, no one will invest in a LNG project counting on China to buy its supplies.
937 2018-10-10 22:05:49 Y’all I done literally had 6 cars  I NEED TO LEARN WHEN A CAR NEED OIL!!
938 2018-10-10 22:05:49 I’ll have to try that out sometime! Did you just fry saffron in olive oil with some garlic?
939 2018-10-10 22:05:47 WTF?  Florida Amendment 9
Prohibits Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling; Prohibits Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces

WTF do these two prohibitions have to do w/ each other?  Why put two completely different  topics/realms  on the same amendment??

950 2018-10-10 22:04:53 Does not matter. If other countries start using another currency to purchase oil, the dollar falls. Google petrodollar. Has nothing to do with where we get oil
951 2018-10-10 22:04:31 Walker Stapleton is a trust fund baby with his elbows deep in oil and gas development. He’d gladly turn our entire gorgeous state into an oil field. He also wants to raise the age for PERA retirement to compensate for his terrible decisions as treasurer. Stapleton is bad for CO.
952 2018-10-10 22:04:31 also puttin a little bit of tea tree oil in your shampooo... any shampoo and jst a lil cz its strong
953 2018-10-10 22:04:28 In the past I’ve voted for an occasional Republican, but things have changed. Now Repubs vote in support of GOP policies, ignoring public opinion.

Lately the GOP has been pushing to drill for oil off the Oregon coast. I’m voting Blue to keep that from happening.

956 2018-10-10 22:04:20 @YorkshireOil great to see you today, Sir Owlfred Tyton-Hodgins @hootingowlgin loves your oil.
957 2018-10-10 22:04:19 They can't.  It was always about power; anything goes.  
And so it does.
If pipelines are too dangerous to move oil then so are trains and trucks.  Stop them all.
Childish - yes.  But Alberta did not start the childishness.
958 2018-10-10 22:04:05 Also, I think your estimate is low. Does that take into consideration indirect effects of the infrastructure that was implemented because of oil?
e.g. If there were that many fewer people would they have built the Parks Highway and developed many towns along it?
959 2018-10-10 22:03:41 I live in oil country. "Underground sequestration" went out the window as soon as frakking came into vogue.
960 2018-10-10 22:03:15 Time to also 'unplug' the $27B in Gas and Oil subsidies.  Thanks for your concern!  #FossilFree #fuckfossilfuel #ThoughtsAndPrayers
961 2018-10-10 22:03:13 Regular blunt and edibles and I'm gucci, I recently learned to enjoy the oil pen
962 2018-10-10 22:03:08 Hey, Gym!  My 401(k) didn’t do so well today. Do you think that it’s the Trump-made inflation from tariffs and higher oil from his Iran anti-Obama campaign?

968 2018-10-10 22:02:22 Oil is clearly getting very scared of Tesla
969 2018-10-10 22:02:17 I wish everyone would stop asking me what I think of the climate change study since I work in natural resources bc my only answer is to start guillotining oil executives
970 2018-10-10 22:02:16 Oh please. I’m as liberal as it gets with not even 400 followers, and I had over 10 purged. Your snake oil is as fake as your profile pic. #TinfoilHats
971 2018-10-10 22:02:14 Have you considered distributing oil support services through the cloud?
972 2018-10-10 22:02:14 What happened to the blue boxes on SPX, UJ, UCAD, Oil?

975 2018-10-10 22:01:56 The oil price is down over $2 a barrel so I'll be expecting to see that drop in fuel prices like the increase as soon as oil went up! Right @circlekireland @goapplegreen
976 2018-10-10 22:01:29 Tell me you watched the Adam Driver  oil barren skit
977 2018-10-10 22:01:09 Is this oil paint on canvas sir?
978 2018-10-10 22:01:08 + kind of can't help himself. He's probably stinky as hell, but the sweat and engine grease and oil aren't smells he's used to, and the thought nevertheless intrigues him.
979 2018-10-10 22:01:04 Not suggesting he doesn't but this team's biggest issue has been and remains the roster. That's on the other guy...
980 2018-10-10 22:01:04 Soon, a popping from the oil could be heard because one spilled open. “Oh fuck—“
981 2018-10-10 22:01:02 And then you see it's on none other than Oz the snake-oil-salesman's show. Checks out.
982 2018-10-10 22:01:01 Meanwhile he’s entering into a deal with Atlantic General (oil leases and holdings) ! Do as I say not as I do .

992 2018-10-10 21:59:45 Ahhh. 2003 Antiwar protests. The time in American history when the tofu eating hippies were correct about the US invading Iraq for control of oil but no one bothered to look into it later.
993 2018-10-10 21:59:44 Oil cleansers 
994 2018-10-10 21:59:42 For this regime, it most certainly would be
995 2018-10-10 21:59:40 Bc they need cushy pillows and blankies, proper vegan food, essential oil diffusers, cozy pajamas, electric toothbrushes, and lots of drugs so they don’t go through withdrawals.  This should trump any money spent on those nasty veterans who are NOT heroes.
996 2018-10-10 21:59:39 Gabby a month ago: Onika’s my best friend and we’re gonna be together forever

Gabby now: I don’t talk to her anymore cause she stinks. She smells like oil, Mommy 
997 2018-10-10 21:59:38 So I’m gonna be streaming today to make up for taking Monday and Tuesday off! I might get a bit of a late start cuz I had to take my car in for an oil change after work, but I’ll see y’all soon!!
998 2018-10-10 21:59:24 食パンさん、おはありですヾ(*´∀｀*)ﾉ
999 2018-10-10 21:59:18 Is this a new Trump imposed focus, sponsored by big oil? I mean, REALLY? Hydrogen is a crappy carrier, the entire fuel cycle is WAY less efficient than direct solar to battery to EV. This must be a joke or a directive, one and the same with this oil shill administration!
1000 2018-10-10 21:59:17 But, oil. 
1001 2018-10-10 21:58:53 You would think that I could find a wholesale/ bulk distributor of synthetic fragrance oils that offers a synthetic Rue Fragrance Oil, but no!  Can anyone help me find one, please?!
1002 2018-10-10 21:58:45 @VirginAustralia @Virgin @richardbranson @ABC finally getting back on the broken plane. So far our flight from Adelaide to Perth is 27 hours delayed. Engine oil leak yesterday has apparently been fixed. Fingers crossed hey..... Crap response from virgin. So @qantas in future.
1003 2018-10-10 21:58:42 @CBCNL I watch Here and Now every night as I have since the 1970's. But that tv ad, the one about uncertainty in the oil and gas industry. That guy sounds so smug it drives me up the wall. It sounds as if he wants us to pay high prices for gas, so he can be successful. Drives me.
1004 2018-10-10 21:58:42 Only reason they’d do that is to raise the price of gas and oil, especially now that the US has fracking galore.
1005 2018-10-10 21:58:39 '2 degrees' has been one of the key failures of communication on #ClimateBreakdown It couldn't have been dumber if the agenda was being quietly manipulated by Saudi princelings at the UN and the world-wide network of richly-funded marketing departments of big oil
1006 2018-10-10 21:58:35 wow.  Thought we had #WorldClass pipelines and oil & gas sector or something like that... #NoLNG #NoFracking #EndFossilFuels
1007 2018-10-10 21:58:09 We were only suppose get Parmesan cheese and we ended up getting an oil changed, lunch at Olive Garden and got a car wash 
1008 2018-10-10 21:57:46 When I was younger I wanted to be brilliant like other students in my class. Now I realize that all they did was burn the midnight oil while everyone else was sleeping.
1009 2018-10-10 21:57:44 Oh girl please don’t use baby oil
1010 2018-10-10 21:57:36 The service is amazing! It worked really well removing my ugly oil stains from my driveway!  I couldn't be happier.

the chili oil with the noodles was so good i need to go buy some of that asap T_T
1017 2018-10-10 21:56:49 Oh also forgot the obvious. The people make a shit ton of money to keep things like cars from progressing into the future so they do super shady shit to keep oil on the market even though it has terrible effects on our world and is a finite resource.
1018 2018-10-10 21:56:42 Calling cops the new Jim Crow, repealing tax cuts, going after oil and gas industry in Texas, abolishing ICE, repealing tax cuts, giving citizenship to illegals and calling them the new cotton pickers. I’ll pass.
1019 2018-10-10 21:56:25 Catch 22. Price of oil skyrockets the Saudis, and Russians laugh to the bank.

1025 2018-10-10 21:55:55 It's called doing a sh*t job of putting together a roster

1027 2018-10-10 21:55:45 @marcorubio Even more dangerous than this hurricane, Mr. Rubio, are politicians like you who take $ from Big Oil & others to IGNORE GLOBAL WARMING and pass costs to poor. I'm sure you're helping insurance interests to protect their shareholders before you lift a finger for poor
1028 2018-10-10 21:55:25 it's been going up for quite a while. when the price of oil goes up the price of heating oil eventually catches up
1029 2018-10-10 21:55:11 Very true.  9/11 was a CONSEQUENCE of stealing oil and backing authoritarian, ant-democratic regimes not an inside job designed to extend that process.
1030 2018-10-10 21:55:06 Don't forget + palm oil
1031 2018-10-10 21:54:57 All propaganda. Jus more oil disasters and money. Yes on 112. Find a job elswhere if destroing my state is your job.
1032 2018-10-10 21:54:40 Hey guys! I’ve been at the car service place for 3 hours and they have told me 4 things that are wrong with my car! At FOUR different price points! Now it’s only an oil change, for free. Patience is definitely something I’m learning this year!!
1033 2018-10-10 21:54:39 Sick af then wanna put baby oil on it

1040 2018-10-10 21:54:07 Sort of an Oil and Water type headline there.
1041 2018-10-10 21:54:00 I read a book called ' Scotland's Choices' which is written by academics. It spells out who the oil belongs too. I cant remember exactly the details. But the upshot is that they are Scottish. Read yourself if interested.
1042 2018-10-10 21:53:52 @MichaelAvenatti @TheFive @DonaldJTrumpJr @FoxNews I would love to volunteer to knock that snake oil salesman= MA out....for charity of course!
1043 2018-10-10 21:53:41 th fact tht i have to wash  my hair before i go out tomorrow killin me? ima jus rinse out the coconut oil throw a beanie n wash it properly at night
1044 2018-10-10 21:53:31 Actually no it really isnt. Theres no point in constantly making random characters lgbt. Actually its really annoying its like christians saying gay is bad. Its constantly pushing it in peoples faces.
1045 2018-10-10 21:53:22 Scotland can be as wealthy by transitioning to a green economy, though. Over decades, with transferable skills into wave/tidal power, should be in a way that does not impact communities the way Thatcher's policies did.
Just using oil for necessary synthetics, not energy.
1046 2018-10-10 21:53:19 At the dealership and this lady in a new MDX says “I came in for an oil change and bought a new car”.   #wealth
1047 2018-10-10 21:53:18 Celebrate yourself/your achievements every day. Even if you’ve accomplished nothing for the day except remembering to put on cuticle oil, celebrate it anyway.
1048 2018-10-10 21:53:11 And I just realized she’s using baby oil. WHY ARE WE PUTTING BABY OIL IN OUR TWATS
1049 2018-10-10 21:53:03 “To have a prayer of 1.5 degrees Celsius, we would need to leave most of the remaining coal, oil and gas underground, compelling the Exxon Mobils and Saudi Aramcos to forgo anticipated revenues of over $33 trillion over the next 25 years.” Yeah, um, that’ll never happen. Doomed.
1050 2018-10-10 21:53:02 Coconut oil is the best thing ever.
1051 2018-10-10 21:52:57 Nice maintenance genius. Skid loader was only half full of hydraulic oil. Not sure where it went. Btw cat hydraulic oil is clear as water. And expensive
1052 2018-10-10 21:52:40 finally found a David’s Tea I don’t like: Horchacha. It does not taste like Horchata but it DOES taste like the highway after a cinnamon oil spill
1053 2018-10-10 21:52:14 Try and ice hot patch that also for me and try a hot bath with Epson salt and lavender oil
1054 2018-10-10 21:51:21 Here’s the thing, we were all sucked in last year by the ‘be patient it’s only one game, it’s only 10 games, it’s only 15 games’… But after the Devils game, the warning bells should be going off, as they were not ready to play, and the coach was back to his old tricks. NOT good
1055 2018-10-10 21:51:12 I know. It smellllls! After all, they have to milk the crabs to get the oil.
1056 2018-10-10 21:51:11 Sure.  The U.S. couldn't have Saddam steal Kuwait's oil cause that would prevent THEM from stealing Kuwait's oil. By that time Saddam had stopped taking orders from the U.S. (which, remember, originally put him in power to stop Iranians from cutting the U.S. out of Iranian oil).
1057 2018-10-10 21:50:57 @nick_clegg you can do one I stole all the oil under your ancestral home u tosser
1058 2018-10-10 21:50:50 my dad was giving me some of his homemade weed infused coconut oil and kept saying how strong it was and cautioning me and said “start with a teaspoon and watch a movie and see how it affects you” and my stepmom said “start with more if you’re watching SNL” 
1059 2018-10-10 21:50:45 Wait til its dry to put the coconut oil in??
1060 2018-10-10 21:50:38 That’s an excellent point. It’s not in China’s best interest to cause too much damage. OPEC learned the same lesson after the oil embargoes of the ‘70’s. The recession it created damaged the oil producing countries investments in U.S. markets.
1061 2018-10-10 21:50:30 try using Essential oil of Oregano and Colloidal Silver mixed with Water *500ppm - 1-3 drops in a cup of water... drink throughout the day - the cup premade.
1062 2018-10-10 21:50:29 i don't smoke weed often, however, I do use CBD oil which helps me a lot. I find that strains of weed with a lot of THC fuck me up mentally however if there's more CBD in the strain i feel a lot better w weed
1063 2018-10-10 21:50:23 As someone in the LGBT community i agree. Its like.. pushing it in peoples faces. Theres nothing wrong with being who you are. But god almighty do you have to push your gay or trans-ness in peoples faces? Thats the same as christians or mormans pushing their religion on you.
1064 2018-10-10 21:50:23 Russia lost over 40% of her per-capita GDP at the beginning of this global assault in the wake of an oil & gas price crash from 6/24/14 through 2015 & beyond.

1068 2018-10-10 21:50:14 send Tom Cruise  dressed as Ethan Hunt to Iran. That will sort out Middle East problem and keep the oil flowing 
1069 2018-10-10 21:50:07 I had to wait on my oil change in the mall yesterday, had to pee so bad, walked in that public restroom and walked right out.

1071 2018-10-10 21:50:04 Trauner likes to imply that our Senators are being bought off by the oil Co's. I'm not buying that.

Naija is just best of the bads
1090 2018-10-10 21:48:50 Came to get an oil change for the first time by myself and I looked the guy dead ass in the face and said “I’ve never done this by myself before and I have no idea what to do”. Lmaoooooooo. I hate me.
1091 2018-10-10 21:48:41 They pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, which were lubricated by oil, so much oil
1092 2018-10-10 21:48:35 It is more than about oil prices. I do not think people outside #US are internalizing how seismic this event is likely to be for #US-#Saudi relations. This will not get pushed under the rug. No amount of money will take care of this.
1093 2018-10-10 21:48:22 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

1098 2018-10-10 21:47:47 Factual proof?! The person you interviewed was chief of stuff and right hand of the minister who was embroiled in the oil scandal that hit Malta in 2013. The famous A. G. He was also an election candidate to the same party. Raw nerve?!
1099 2018-10-10 21:47:42 I think you’ll find several of the highest level oil and gas executives are in full support of the carbon tax. I think I’ll take their informed lead.

1101 2018-10-10 21:47:33 I'm no fan of what this front office has done w/ the roster since taking over but the plan is pretty clear when it comes to the kids. Puljujarvi & Yamamoto will get their shot to earn top 6/9 mins & Bouchard will end up in the CHL. The rest sit and wait their turn. Pretty simple.
1102 2018-10-10 21:47:31 It oil prices stupid 
Rising Oil prices are a tax/drag on the US & world economies. The Fed has yet to ever get it right.
When oil approaches $90 a barrel there is NO Need to raise interest rates.  

The oil price increase does that job

Is the Fed is the cutting edge of stupid
1103 2018-10-10 21:47:31 Oil money

1106 2018-10-10 21:47:21 I am probably more right wing than Europe together on the environment. For Britain not to take it’s share of Arctic oil, the renewables have to be profitable and equitable.
1107 2018-10-10 21:47:12 I’m out of deodorant and I used tea tree oil! It burns but my pits look good! 
1108 2018-10-10 21:47:05 oil won't blow my house up.
1109 2018-10-10 21:46:54 No doubt the SOLDIERS went for a variety of reasons. But the U.S. state/corporations (which is what I'm talking about) is ONLY in the Middle East for the oil.  Everything else is subordinate to that goal. Any other causal factor relates back to that goal.
1110 2018-10-10 21:46:50 You must have raised him to think the rest of us owe him something. Free college. Free healthcare. Free hash oil. At 18 he has contributed nothing and is owed nothing.

1113 2018-10-10 21:46:32 Is this to get the coconut oil out? I did read about this but I was concerned it would form a paste. I put coconut oil on my hair all the time but was clearly WAY too generous with it last night. 
1114 2018-10-10 21:46:27 @bensemchee @cryptorecruitr maybe the reset did happen. With weather modification use a hurricane to stop 40% of our production/ have the missing guy in turkey that people are oil companies are stopping work with Saudi Arabia. Also stock market down 800 pts
1115 2018-10-10 21:46:24 No, @IEABirol, we don't "really need more oil". What we really need is more investment in clean, #RenewableEnergy sources, like wind, solar, hydro, tidal, and geothermal.
1116 2018-10-10 21:46:20 And I should note: funded by Saudi princes funneling them stolen Saudi Aramco oil money.

1122 2018-10-10 21:45:59 @ZakkWyldeBLS hey Boss, ever consider putting out some kind of beard oil? Wylde’s Berserker Beard oil, Wylde’s Black Label Beard oil. I think there are plenty of us that would purchase it.

1155 2018-10-10 21:42:54 @DavidLenigas Fantastic insight, educational info (especially for non oilers) and great visual proof to start turning heads. Much more can be done with this to raise positive exposure. The most ethical oil ever in UK? No fra*****, no $’s to  or 
1156 2018-10-10 21:42:46 By the way, no "one world order" is taking all the oil. We just won't use as much. Nothing will change strategically if we don't want it to. At any rate, security seems easier if we don't have to depend on a resource. Otherwise I can't make any sense of what you're saying.
1157 2018-10-10 21:42:43 Heating oil is way up for this winter. Double-digit percent increase over last year.

1163 2018-10-10 21:42:12 Electric vehicles and renewables do have their place in future, but to consider them a threat to oil and gas industry seems a bit of a overambitious, given the vast array of products either produced by oil and gas or need oil and gas to work.

They know the oil will run out at some point and seek to gain influence and a role in the world beyond oil for generations. The list of acquisitions is immense and diverse. Going nowhere IMO for as long as PL remains global.
1177 2018-10-10 21:41:15 Yeah, well, the U.S. doesn't have a history of demanding anything from the oil rich Said is.

1187 2018-10-10 21:40:29 the men at meineke tried to tell me that I brought my car in too late to get the oil changed but according to the appointment I made online, 5:30 is actually an okay time! look at that!
1188 2018-10-10 21:40:26 Was gonna do my oil change soon as I got home but it decided to rain
1189 2018-10-10 21:40:24 As far as Ouljujarvi goes, let us see where things stand in the next couple of weeks before hitting the panic button. Just an fyi, having him go to the AHL would have the opposite effect. Go ask Leon how pleased he was to start '15-'16 in the minors.

1194 2018-10-10 21:40:17 Yeah, it just confused me because my oil engineering expert didn't call it that. And the folks at E&B say that they don't use chemicals, just water, in the fields they're working. [like Russell Ranch] Somebody else must be though.

1199 2018-10-10 21:39:33 AB’s high CO2 is driven by reliance on fossil fuels + oil sands. But pro-O&G mentality fuels inefficient urban growth patterns, hence almost 90% is literally unsustainable (costs exceeds revenues). Generations of pro-O&G propaganda make it hard for many AB to see things clearly.

1208 2018-10-10 21:38:28 And, they've been going down as far as 8 miles to find oil and gas. Common industry practice now, but the Russians pioneered it by ignoring Western biotic theory (fossil fuel) and following their own chemists, who found too many inorganic chemicals in fuels for it to be biotic.

1216 2018-10-10 21:38:08 I remember when there was the massive oil spill. It’s going to be devastating. I can’t imagine how much gas prices have gone up. Price gauging is definitely a thing down there

1219 2018-10-10 21:37:55 Ita one of many but their goals are clear, they are advancing electric cars solar energy to replace oil. This is fact.
If you find those goals somehow wrong I am confused as to what you find right in a company...
1220 2018-10-10 21:37:52 Worse then that the money was stolen from the Russian people.  How did this clown acquire state owned oil refineries?  Stole it from the Russian people.  Probably given to him by Putin.  The GOP  is cool with stealing from the masses and giving to the few.
1221 2018-10-10 21:37:51 Not uncommon for a player in Bouchard's spot to sit every now again and allow him to watch the odd game from up top and not give him too much too fast. Also, the Oilers didn't do Yak any favours but said player can look in the mirror.  There are no other prospects they "ruined"
1222 2018-10-10 21:37:46 ...you will have problem.
1223 2018-10-10 21:37:46 Not sure you point.

There's no reason they couldn't switch to renewables and have done with oil altogether than choosing either of these options.
1224 2018-10-10 21:37:38 I got some mint-flavored oil and have been adding it to my morning mocha.  It calms the brain squirrels.
1225 2018-10-10 21:37:16 The principal is the same, though. They're shooting water to chase oil out of where it's trapped in shale substrates.

1236 2018-10-10 21:35:39 now the summer is over the only way I can motivate myself to get up on time is to do a coconut oil hair mask that needs to be washed out before I leave the house
1237 2018-10-10 21:35:34 really??? OK, you must be referring to water injection technologies, which is what the oil guy told me about in the Carrizo Plain story.
1238 2018-10-10 21:35:32 The Media and Major Corporations like the Oil Industry and the Coal Industry don't want you to think there is anything wrong. The Oceans are heating up at a rapid pace as evidenced by the 2 MAJOR Hurricanes to hit us in the last month.
1239 2018-10-10 21:35:31 He did years ago  I use hemp seed oil my mom uses CBD oil I have arthritis in my neck and chronic migraines.
1240 2018-10-10 21:35:15 Mmm no it's not. They aren't, in fact, fossil fuels, so-called. Russians have been drilling for oil on abiotic theory since the 1950s. That's how they became a major exporter of oil and gas. No bio remains exist below the first mile of crust. Below that is the lithosphere itself.
1241 2018-10-10 21:35:12 i mean yeah i totally understand being broke and not being able to afford sex toys but uhhhh, she obviously bought something from victoria’s secret  and that shit isn’t cheap not to mention for the price she paid for that baby oil she could’ve gotten some ACTUAL lube

What "regulations"? How does moving from fossil fuels to renewables benefit "them," whomever "they" are? How?

This is exactly like moving from whale oil to petroleum. Would you decry the decline of whale oil as some evil plot? Of course not.

1265 2018-10-10 21:33:30 We would all still be using fucking whale oil in gas lamps if you had any say in it. Just die already, your generation has done enough...
1266 2018-10-10 21:33:29 The US isn't as dependent on foreign oil as the rest of the world. Cheaper costs to drill, refine and ship a produce leads to lower taxes. Do you really think it's fair to compare German gas costs to those in the US? Our system is designed to tax those who use roads based on use.
1267 2018-10-10 21:33:13 Well, I have a few too, what usually stumps them is when I ask what possible motive 99% of all climate scientist have for deliberately falsifying their conclusions throughout their careers. There’s nothing in it for them in this ”conspiracy”. As opposed to the oil and coal lobby.
1268 2018-10-10 21:33:12 Gonna have to do my homework tonight: What’s your take on Prop 112? The ballot issue about oil/gas setbacks & the future of the industry in CO has divided communities. @JennKovaleski goes 360 to show multiple sides on heated topic you'll vote on in Nov., tonight at 10 on #Denver7
1269 2018-10-10 21:33:12 2. Every govt misses opportunities by choosing to focus on one area rather than another.

For ex: By pursuing or not TransMountain it can both be argued that the govt is missing the opportunity to:

a) Get full price and expanded markets for or oil
b) Seize the Green revolution
1270 2018-10-10 21:33:10 Fun fact I learned in this process: Fracking in California is for oil not natural gas
1271 2018-10-10 21:33:09 I love when videos are so compressed that the pixels start to blend together and it looks like an oil painting.
1272 2018-10-10 21:33:09 Hypothetical question but if we stopped oil production for energy purposes tomorrow, would we still burn fossil fuels to make plastic? Or is plastic only viable as a byproduct? #DrowningInPlastic

1286 2018-10-10 21:31:38 Oh I love that stuff it’s so great. I used to think the same thing about oil too, but it’s actually the opposite. It signals to your skin to not produce more oil because it’s moisturized. I’ve been adding oil on top of my moisturizer for about 2 months now and I’m less oily.

The volatility is already baked into the news cycle and all the countries are steadily increasing the oil production. 

Volatility is a measure of uncertainty, usually clouded by unforeseen events. While the potential for them always exists, the probability is low

1318 2018-10-10 21:27:09 theres a post about two ships that crashed and there was an oil spill. but it didn’t make sense cause they had ALL that ocean and crashed into each other? those kinda ships move slow and they would have known about each other WAY before they even got close to hitting each other

1346 2018-10-10 21:23:30 And even the expensive shit is only possible because things like oil extracted from the global south too.
1347 2018-10-10 21:23:11 I went inside and asked the clerk and he said it’s “set by the oil company.” But the Lukoil nearby is 50 cents cheaper.

Oh and Putin really wants a weak US economy so he can influence it.

Wait, that's the DNC platform.
1358 2018-10-10 21:22:11 But don't worry ya'll its just going to get worse because Trump has decided not to pay attention to climate scientists and Major reports that we have just a decade to prevent this from getting significantly worse. Because his MASTERS are all Big Oil oligarchs and bad energy
1359 2018-10-10 21:22:06 Nope, only natural oils (coconut oil)
1360 2018-10-10 21:21:54 This only means we will sell them less weapons but buy more of their oil.

1365 2018-10-10 21:21:35 Nor does the millions of gallons of oil spilled, we can absorb that just fine. Who needs clean water anyway?And   I am sure we'll survive just fine when our crops can't grow due to heat and flooding...yup. Let's do nothing.
1366 2018-10-10 21:21:32 my and boys from Louisiana are like oil and water. they be fine asf but we don’t mix at all
1367 2018-10-10 21:21:28 Only if we get oil glazed beefcakes in budgie smugglers too.. (you may to Google those terms, not sure if they are used in the States) 
1368 2018-10-10 21:21:23 #Oil is too complicated a market to game for elections probably; and I've been skeptical that gasoline prices, even at recent premiums to year ago levels, have been high enough (or low enough) to be much of an election year factor. Methinks Trump tweets are why it is brought up.
1369 2018-10-10 21:21:20 Steel is so expensive that it is not profitable to build, sanctions on Iran are leading to oil prices increasing, higher inflation is eating at the dollars value (when we need it to be strong) & the market is hyperventilating from a 25 basis point interest rate hike...

1373 2018-10-10 21:20:48 Sounds like high tech lol, I’ve only seen normal coconut oil here. xD But you’re probably right, people say it works wonders.

1376 2018-10-10 21:19:47 Of all the right's contradictory lies about the left, the most annoying is this "Democrats want to turn us into Venezuela" thing. Venezuela is an authoritarian petro-state, not some fallen Denmark run by Berniecrats. Also, lefties want oil to stay in the ground. #USAToday
1377 2018-10-10 21:19:35 Again, look at US/South America. Rainforests destroyed for beef cattle ranging of to grow feed for US factory farms. 80+ % of world soya is grown for cattle feed. Corn too, so much US uses excess to turn it into HFCS which goes into everything. Palm oil is mostly 85% Asian issue
1378 2018-10-10 21:19:34 Leaders in renewables, fishing and territorial waters, in oil, biotechnology and gaming, to name but a few jewels in Scotland portfolio.

I think the EU care a lot more than you think about an independent Scotlands relationship with it's continental neighbours, nevermind NATO.
1379 2018-10-10 21:19:33 Hi there. Somehow that looks kind of like an oil painting.
1380 2018-10-10 21:19:32 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @FBI @DHSgov @ODNIgov @NSAGov IMO Sulzberger-NYT should also cover at same time many US Religious Groups members that get near Tax Exempt Status while trading Diamonds,Gold,R.E.,Insurance, Oil,Tobacco,etc. or lose all credibility
1381 2018-10-10 21:19:31 I use Philosophy purity one-step facial cleanser to cleanse my face and then I apply the moisturizer after my toner, following up with an oil over the moisturizer so my skin won’t produce more oil. I use the moisturizer day and night
1382 2018-10-10 21:19:29 In class today we talked about how technology is taking over. The tutor told us that her fridge sends her a text when her milk is low.. and she can switch off house lights by her mobile phone.. it’s crazy how we went from oil lamps to controlling your house by the tap of a button
1383 2018-10-10 21:19:15 The only thing we expect from every nation is that if you are not going to help us -the people of Iran- dont make troubles. You wanna buy oil, buy it from other countries. Give your money somewhere else. That's all. But I also believe #EU is going for new measures against Iran.
1384 2018-10-10 21:19:15 We also had a march for all pain patients & I'd like day they ignored it but they went much further to distort it & spread less again.
Global warming is just one more thing they've refused to acknowledg, spending millions to make sure to push big oil agenda.

1386 2018-10-10 21:19:09 What? Is he running out of money. Yes, some may be true but much is a scam. One year warm and the next complaining they didnt think they were going to need to stock heating oil. Think back!

1402 2018-10-10 21:17:18 can't remember where, but thought i read something about russian oil being stoked for global warming which will free up more resources to drill at. also economic/shipping opportunities for the northern sea passage if it's not constantly full of ice.
1403 2018-10-10 21:17:18 Well, since there are oil fields it stands to reason that there would be natural gas down there too. But aquifers are scarce enough that fracking would be a problem re groundwater contamination. [not to mention earthquake stimulators-just ask any Okie these days :-) )
1404 2018-10-10 21:17:08 Ive never looked into it but i think thered be a few good homemade treatments that work, like maybe watered down coconut oil?

1421 2018-10-10 21:15:46 I don't disagree with your analysis of Tesla, but would point out a couple of things. Many businesses thrive on tax breaks. The oil companies come to mind. And Tesla has a car that is turning over our old ideas about automobiles. I wish Elon would stop tweeting.

1450 2018-10-10 21:11:53 @realDonaldTrump Never worry about oil prices, it will be a temporary rise in oil prices. Think about the fact that a full stop in Iran's oil exports will bring your popularity to the throats, people will not pay attention to the price of oil and gasoline prices
1451 2018-10-10 21:11:51 Oil isn't going to be a good business for us going forward. Our product isn't desirable, shipping costs are far too high, and nobody wants to deal with the toxic leftover (heavy metals, toxic substances, and radioactive waste) by-products of refining bitumen.
1452 2018-10-10 21:11:38 They can exchange oil for water.
1453 2018-10-10 21:11:18 I did the same today Nick... used a 10mm nap roller with oil based gloss on 40 odd round detailed spindles, panel doors, dado and skirts... I reckon they've saved me a day on this job so far... will see the dried finish tomor.

1473 2018-10-10 21:09:25 Problems in the GOP were evident well before 1992. Buckley /NR were racist, misogynist, entitlist.

1505 2018-10-10 21:06:41 Really?  Shetland is part of Scotland! If by any strange reason they wanted to change that, they would need to vote for a party that wants that, then win an election. Oh, BTW, if that happened, they would become an enclave, with.... You guessed it, no oil in their waters!

1507 2018-10-10 21:06:38 All it takes is one cool person I like saying anything and suddenly I’m chugging CBD oil like it’s Blue Apron.
1508 2018-10-10 21:06:31 No way. Mittens doesn't have it in him to go Cocaine Mitch or Grahmanetor.
1509 2018-10-10 21:06:27 I put coconut oil in Peyton’s hair earlier bc they say that helps with curls and keeps them from frizzing but her hair just looks extra oily and that’s bc I washed it

1516 2018-10-10 21:06:01 Just watched two people running on foot from the about 5-6 cop cars. They ran through the Lotaburger parking lot and one of them jumped the wall into someone’s backyard. Glad I got my oil changed now. Gotta love #CarlsbadNM!
1517 2018-10-10 21:06:00 use tea tree oil too with it combined, thank me later!
1518 2018-10-10 21:05:53 He probably has a chunk of Genie Oil in his back pocket. 

They made him out to be the Lone Ranger over kavanaugh so the base would be primed 4 the next big push of the Israeli agenda.

1520 2018-10-10 21:05:42 Outrage from the supporters of Donald "I'll pay your legal fees" Trump? Holder wasn't encouraging violence unless you people plan on being Low life's? Like being flagrant obstructionist for a Qualified President. Now all starry eyed for the Snake oil reality TV guy.
1521 2018-10-10 21:05:39 I'm still on meds for mine. Mine is a chronic condition. I have cut back to Lexapro and CBD oil without THC.  Blessings to you and I'm sorry about your daughter. My condolences.
1522 2018-10-10 21:05:38 But this time, when I ran down and got my water, I decided I didn't want to be scared anymore. So I took a deep breath at the beginning of the hallway and started walking. I saw a figure that looked human shaped, but it was the color of oil on pavement. Like a rainbow.
1523 2018-10-10 21:05:16  if i took ketamine to relieve my stress i’d be BROKE and getting my bladder removed peeps are dumb. cbd oil is the real stress relieving gangster

1525 2018-10-10 21:05:11 @ritula US has plenty of wasta (clout) in Saudi. 
More than likely national oil co, Aramco will want to list on Wall St.
1526 2018-10-10 21:05:10 I agree. I guess as an American it’s terrifying to see a president, Congress, and Supreme Court now that will be against moving in the direction of green energy and  in fact are pushing to rely more heavily on coal+ oil.
1527 2018-10-10 21:05:09 I'm afraid you are being too optimistic. Eurobanks are pressuring the US to reconsider oil sanctions, & I have read that the Trump Administration is considering it.
1528 2018-10-10 21:05:08 I cancelled Deciem when Brandon told the black girl she should bleach. I literally put all my products in the break room at work...except for the rose hip oil.
1529 2018-10-10 21:05:05 Everyone needs to top off there gas sometime today if possible. I have a feeling the prices are gonna go up. They shut down all the oil rigs in the gulf
1530 2018-10-10 21:05:03 This routine has helped reduced the oilyness? Cos the oil on my face ehn when ive got makeup on like before the end of the day you can actually fry an egg on it!!
1531 2018-10-10 21:05:02 Nothing is scarier than spinning out unexpectedly from a oil spill in a big ass truck lol
1532 2018-10-10 21:04:57 @realDonaldTrump  Khashoggi wrote. "Trump tweets that he is protecting us. He protects us from what? Or he is protecting who? I believe that the greatest threat facing the Gulf countries and their oil is a president such as Trump who sees nothing in us apart from the oil wells,"
1533 2018-10-10 21:04:57 No se que sería de mi vida si no existiera el CBD oil
1534 2018-10-10 21:04:57 never BC they live on black milk--oil. I wonder when people in red states will wake up since they suffer the most from hurricanes strengthened by global warming.  Will they always vote against their own interests as they did on tax cut and obamacare. Some psychologist help me pls
1535 2018-10-10 21:04:52 If you drive a gas burning car are the emissions from the oil company,  the car company,  or you?

1544 2018-10-10 21:03:59 Plus overall, bad storm in the gulf which always gets the oil market panicky, and the Saudi issue with them mudering a journalist, Tariffs against China which i dont think will hit theyve already announced lowering impory tarriffs so theyre getting amiable with us, plus tech..
1545 2018-10-10 21:03:53 Oil investors are slick talkers.
1546 2018-10-10 21:03:52 If you like, keep crying like OBJ & Danjuma, Buhari will not renew any oil block for you guys...

If you like, cry like...who used to get free money from Aso Rock,

1547 2018-10-10 21:03:35 That's not how this works. Would it be ok for the gov't to tell the oil companies to charge for gas? Would it be ok for the gov't to tell grocery stores how much to charge for food? 
(if your answer to any of these is "Yes"...move to Venezuela...that's how it goes down there)

1561 2018-10-10 21:02:06 Still we do anything rash.  We still get 10% of our imported oil from Saudi Arabia, and most of our petroleum is used for transportation. So we play nice with these regressive monarchs, even when they behaved terribly.

1563 2018-10-10 21:01:56 I'm really disappointed in the amount of vitamin supplements being pushed by podcasts now. I understand that your podcast is a business that needs sponsors and advertising money but I also expect my fellow creators to be more socially conscious and to say no to snake oil salesmen
1564 2018-10-10 21:01:51 So warm out today, but my oil company showed up to fill the tank.  Very confusing.

1566 2018-10-10 21:01:44 I covered and broke even and shorted nflx grub amzn jpm.  Oil was driving me nuts even though demand was dropping.  The Iran obsession persists with the speculators so I gave up.

1571 2018-10-10 21:01:23 And you have a troubling record of taking HUGE SUMS OF MONEY from the oil and gas lobbies. Don't act like you're in it for the people. You're in it for the biggest contributors...PACs and special interest.

1579 2018-10-10 21:00:59 There’s nothing wrong with “Soul Food”. Get organic meats it’s expensive but better, fry in Peanut oil or Sunflower oil. Trade salt pork for seasoning with smoked turkey & you still can achieve that Mmmm Mmmm Southern goodness! However butter must stay in the Mac n Cheese 
1580 2018-10-10 21:00:59 Good analogy for these junk plans: they are like car insurance that covers oil changes but not collision or liability in the event of an accident
1581 2018-10-10 21:00:54 I agree. Oil works for freeing animals from these. Of course then they're covered in oil, but at least not glued in place.

1589 2018-10-10 21:00:26 According to international maritime law, Shetland, if it went Indy, would only have maritime enclave status which means they would only get a small inshore area of sea around the island, giving it  virtually none of the oil+gas and trapping it in a bubble of scottish waters
1590 2018-10-10 21:00:25 October 10, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1595 2018-10-10 20:59:59 Deforestation is mainly occurring presently for palm oil production! Dairy grazing generally occurs on land unsuitable for arable, and most farmers harvest silage and hay for winter feed as dry feed is extremely expensive and not great for milk yield! Crops are grown for humans
1596 2018-10-10 20:59:52 You brought up oil. Wasn’t even in my convo.
1597 2018-10-10 20:59:49 Not when your long oil and gas!
1598 2018-10-10 20:59:40 This smacks of dirty oil company money payola...oil companies have spent billions to disrupt climate action by setting up bogus think tanks and propaganda mills.

1604 2018-10-10 20:58:57 We can’t bring up much more oil, we’ll end up losing half our country in rising sea levels

1614 2018-10-10 20:57:49 @Ayisha_Malik you should try the Lindt hazelnut spread. It’s more expensive but tastes so much better than Nutella and doesn’t contain palm oil.
1615 2018-10-10 20:57:44 Another 40 Billion in deficits and more people laid off in the oil patch and no end in site.  Another term . Not Happening.  Boom Mike drop.

1627 2018-10-10 20:56:24 trump is pretty bad re animals tho.  he's let go  bird treaty act, let go protection of nets for whales/turtles/dolphins. wants to do oil in oceans. eased rollbacks on very dirty environmental practices. he doesn't like  animals so appeal to others in admin. that do.
1628 2018-10-10 20:56:19 How long it take to do an oil change
1629 2018-10-10 20:56:17 The oldest civilization. It may be to increase the oil prices so the trump supporters in the oil industry will donate even more..
1630 2018-10-10 20:56:08 I won't bring up specifics, but your culinary skills have come under some question. The oil based, cheese free "processed food slice" nonsense can walk the plank, but not the mulitcheese melting perfection that is genuine "American Cheese"
1631 2018-10-10 20:56:04 I have been to Southern California a few times.  I didn't care for it.  Too much traffic and crazy regulations.  I work for a race team and we were not permitted to use our generators to warm up the engine oil for the race car.  Worse than New Jersey...
1632 2018-10-10 20:55:58 Oil prices averaged 49USD/pd under OBJ. His first term was devoted mainly to structural reforms both in the civil service and the military. There was no way the economy could have grown in that first term. Second term however showed significant growth

1634 2018-10-10 20:55:54 You can without a doubt find balance in Democratic Socialism but it will require a leader that is not money hungry. One that will not just randomly print more dollars just because. One that will not take away private businesses and profit from oil money.

1636 2018-10-10 20:55:43 My poor @fitbit has gone through so much. Jet fuel. Avgas. Brake cleaner. Clean engine oil. Dirty engine oil. Yet it still survives!
1637 2018-10-10 20:55:41 Warming them up makes the oil in them warm and then breaking them up means every bit has some of that warm oil so it probably does improve flavour but you don't need to go nuts with the pestle & mortar just bruise them.
1638 2018-10-10 20:55:37 #UKOG Just ignore the lot of 'em!. UKOG's now an oil producer. It's gushing out of the ground - and no assist! Will the sp gush to 3p by Friday close?? Well, it would be nice. (barring a Wall Street Crash!)
1639 2018-10-10 20:55:33 I detect paranoia, Marc. The #nightcrapper is winning 
1. Get some Olbas oil, sprinkle it on dry used tea bags wherever it  most often. 2. Prune some roses & lay the bits on the soil likewise 
3. Cat mine 
4. Sacrifice sleep & get a super soaker

Having mentioned that, we had to navigate our country to safety by giving bailouts to those States on several occasions even as oil was selling below $30 then.
Today, we thank God.
1641 2018-10-10 20:55:23 Me:  we have oil and gas for the entire planet!
Justin:  but the Orcas and "indigenous"!
1642 2018-10-10 20:55:09 I will never understand why the left and right pretend to be accepting. Them accepting opinions mix as well as water and oil.
1643 2018-10-10 20:54:58 Exactly why we need to get off oil, but how to do it without collapsing the economy is another solution.
1644 2018-10-10 20:54:57 almost had an emotional meltdown just trying to get my oil changed. I love being an adult

1646 2018-10-10 20:54:48 Yay I see my perf.
1647 2018-10-10 20:54:45 EV adoption will lower oil demand worldwide.

Lower demand will lower prices.

Lower prices will kill off oil sands expansion.

Further price erosion will shut down operating mines.

It's over. Sell your stock.

1649 2018-10-10 20:54:26 Straw hat, bamboo cane, snarky schtick, snake oil by the gallon...
1650 2018-10-10 20:54:10 I got home heating oil today and paid 2.94 a gallon. Gasoline is up 40 cents more since last year. What happened to the great economy I keep hearing about?
1651 2018-10-10 20:54:04 Or I can just donate to Navalny, he may be not left enough for Sanders, but his minimum wage hike, doubling healthcare spending, milking all-but-privatized state oil&gas monopolies and fighting Putin's corrupt oligarch-controlled regime is exactly what Sanders said there.

1656 2018-10-10 20:53:23 This girl was waxing a vagina. (In school ), rubbed oil all over it then came and touched my arm with the same gloves.....bro..........
1657 2018-10-10 20:53:06 Think I found the last oil leak from the engine of dads car he left behind, I got a possible idea how to fix one, but the other two look like possible cracks in the engine itself which means, shit I dunno, bad news.
1658 2018-10-10 20:52:57 Sadly, this one is clearly beyond help. Save for helping herself of course, hence the lies. Amazing how oil is worthless when we talk about it, but THEIRS when we talk of independence. Feart doesn't come close, their absolutely petrified.

1667 2018-10-10 20:51:49 “squeaky wheel gets the oil.”

the squeaky word means a person talking crap like literally won’t shut up. Then when it says “gets the oil” it means people do whatever they can to get the specific person to shut up so she/he get what she/he wants, in other words “gets the oil.”
1668 2018-10-10 20:51:43 Beards used to mean you could actually change a tire, and your own oil too.

1673 2018-10-10 20:51:09 I don't disagree... Also, I don't recall saying we'll all stop eating meat/milk in ten years. Best way to dramatically reduce meat consumption is by creating plant-based & clean meat products that are cheaper & better (taste & sustainability). that's what I do. for oil usage?
1674 2018-10-10 20:50:59 ❛ Good! For a perfect steak you need a heavy-duty, thick-based frying pan, ideally with a non-stick coating, use groundnut oil because it's the best and i use it all the time. If you want to make a well-done steak, it'll have only a trace of pink colour but not dry. It will ─

1679 2018-10-10 20:50:32 I don't think it's quite as random as you suggest. There's a reason and it will be crystal clear in a few days, weeks, months, etc. There's a host of possible culprits. Yields, Inflation, China, Election, Italy, Brazil. Oil/Gas. But it's not random as your tweet implies.

1684 2018-10-10 20:49:57 What are the most reliable and accurate sources for tracking Methane and CO2 emissions globally?  I ask because i'm helping a project aimed at downstream Oil & Gas to do this at scale.
1685 2018-10-10 20:49:56 Quite a few tongue-bath articles in the NYT when Hitler rose to power. But let’s not talk about that.
1686 2018-10-10 20:49:53 If it is so impractical, then why are oil and gas companies like Exxon shifting their focus to energy generation and research instead of just oil and gas production? 

Fun fact: gas isn't an infinite resource, even though your hot air, apparently, is an endless supply.
1687 2018-10-10 20:49:51 Exactly, CPP are mad at addicts like it's the addicts choice to have gotten addicted. No one wakes up one day & says "Hey I want to become addicted to meth"

1690 2018-10-10 20:49:22 There is zero connection between killing off the Canadian oil sands and winning the EV race. Right now, we are simply taking $$$ from Canadians and handing it to Saudi Arabia and others.

1695 2018-10-10 20:49:12 If you think that's so, go for it. But seems to me all those Western and southern states with all their coal and oil and farmland can form quite a viable nation.

1698 2018-10-10 20:48:54 There's many Canadians who say, "The world won't act, so why should we?" My response is that even in that case, we have a self-interested reason to act: If we don't, the oil sands will get the blame for climate change. They're too massive for us to claim that we don't matter.

1702 2018-10-10 20:48:27 Yeah it is because when I was on the boat my captain put me on G about Hurricane Katrina like even though it fucked up the gulf coast it made a lot of people rich in different industries including the oil field

1713 2018-10-10 20:47:32 But you also have to understand why Baghdad has to pay the Kurdish budget, which it did not for years. A significant portion of that country’s oil is located in Kurdistan. Baghdad makes money with Kurdistan, and it gives Kurds only a small portion of that money if any at all.

1770 2018-10-10 20:41:16 Mr. Zinke either does not understand or purposefully does not acknowledge that it is far more about control of the oil reserves. These soldiers are not ordered to invade other countries because US energy needs are not met, but because US government wants to dominate.

1777 2018-10-10 20:40:26 Of course with different organizations, that brings different culture. I know a few oil and gas companies that don’t drug test at all. They don’t want to spend money on it. It’s not profitable for them. Then others, well. They want a hair follicle not a UA.

1790 2018-10-10 20:38:44 Right now.....we should be building water transport pipe lines. Those areas that have excessive rain should be statistically mapped. and intersected. The areas that are parse or available to percolation should be mapped as well. WATER is the new OIL.
1791 2018-10-10 20:38:43 Make sure you tell those nice people about the huge stock market drop today, rising interest rates and fuel cost. Tell them how you cut a deal with the Saudis to get the price of a barrel of oil closer to a hundred by pulling out of Iranian deal.
1792 2018-10-10 20:38:40 Russia will bail you out? Oh yeah, especially  since Putin promised to spent $400bn on infrastructure in Russia and ... also was forced to increase retirement age ... oil prices are going down during a recession, or? *popcorn*

Democrats in Congress and the Democrat presidents have long, long sucked-up to Saudi Arabia because of the oil and their cooperation with us in the wars in the Middle East.

Obama and Clinton even basically sucked-up to Saudi Arabia.
1801 2018-10-10 20:37:52 Good news. While US market did take a nasty hit today from its all-time highs, remember than Russia's ETF is down 54% from its all-time high. Ruble's a wreck.

1890 2018-10-10 20:29:34 Assad is not the bad guy, he is defending Syria from an invasion of foreign mercenaries, paid for by KSA, Turkey, France, UK & USA. You must know that ISIS is a western construct, created to remove assad and prevent rival oil and gas routes - sounds unbelievable, but true!!!
1891 2018-10-10 20:29:31 literally just pasta with some roasted veggies like broccoli cauliflower green beans, whatever you want, season them, cover in an oil dressing. is so easy and good mate
1892 2018-10-10 20:29:23 one of those alcohol monitors that ppl with DUIs blow into to prove they didn't drink to start their cars, but instead it makes sure you *did* take an adequate amount of cbd oil (makes you a better driver)
1893 2018-10-10 20:29:22 American cheese is only one grade above Velveeta. Oil yellow dye mixed with embalming fluid and added milk. Yum
1894 2018-10-10 20:29:21 Coconut oil is one of the least healthy oil you can eat it is a fallacy that is healthy and has higher amounts of saturated fat than lard @mmmhotbreakfast
1895 2018-10-10 20:29:08 The WORLD has left us behind. Its even more pathetic when we don't realise. We still hanging on that monolithic oil price thread we have no control over. We living DANGEROUSLY!!!
1896 2018-10-10 20:29:06 @Mamoxn your analysis is always above the water because God knows @ZANUPF_Official makes it flood issues! lol!  I was almost feeling relieved I found a 2ltr cooking oil, now I'm mad! why did I have to go through this? hee varakashi? lol!
1897 2018-10-10 20:28:58 VASELINE IS NOT LUBRICANT! BABY OIL IS NOT LUBRICANT! STOP LETTING THESE DIRTY MEN PUT WHATEVER THEY WANT INSIDE YOU THEN WONDER WHY YA KEEP GETTING YEAST INFECTIONS!
1898 2018-10-10 20:28:49 Will it be good for engines? Is it more efficient than oil based fuels?
1899 2018-10-10 20:28:44 He will forget about it for cheaper oil
1900 2018-10-10 20:28:40 Wow!  He's clearly being paid by big oil.
1901 2018-10-10 20:28:40 2018 economic disaster ne 2018 cooking oil price hike zvinhu 2 zvakasiyana so u left 2018 cooking oil issues
1902 2018-10-10 20:28:38 It will happen anyway pal... EV adoption alone will kill off the oil sands so maybe we should get a jump on this transition?
1903 2018-10-10 20:28:36 Similarly done as the Weaverville School Gas, Oil, Propane, I was one of the last to go through with Susan River before EPA shut it down. Great experience and live fire always works good for training.
1904 2018-10-10 20:28:31 If I like this tweet, does it make me gay? Well, too late.
1905 2018-10-10 20:28:24 I'm sure your natural hair is beautiful. I suggest you use argan oil deep conditioning hair treatment.
1906 2018-10-10 20:28:22 Не, я согласна, что такой поворот событий нельзя ни роялем из кустов назвать, ни банальщиной, но всё равно, каждый месяц ждать новую главу ради того, чтобы в конце концов, просто башкой биться о стену... Ну, как-то не очень.
1907 2018-10-10 20:28:21 I should get this *checks acct balance
1908 2018-10-10 20:28:03 americans are wild, one lives on our floor and has been seen eating plain chicken and pasta with vegetable oil
1909 2018-10-10 20:27:56 The same SE of England that has used the money from SCOTTISH OIL (yes, it is in Scottish waters) to pay for its vanity projects and wars for decades. I agree that is important to remember.

1911 2018-10-10 20:27:29 I'll bring some hydraulic oil and a bag of marbles to help you with your training.
1912 2018-10-10 20:27:13 Yeah... it's not like we could almost instantly average every single stock price in the world within a matter of miliseconds.  We need to know about how well US Steel and Standard oil and IBM are doing.  

(Yeah it's not those stocks anymore but you get the point.)
1913 2018-10-10 20:27:12 If it’s a gloss though, yeah there’s very few out there that will match oil
1914 2018-10-10 20:26:51 Castor oil or rosemary oil
1915 2018-10-10 20:26:45 Bruh this lady just came in with a 1998 ford Taurus with 12,000 miles on it then paid 610 dollars to get its FIRST oil change and new brakes... wow.
1916 2018-10-10 20:26:43 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama had our gas down to close to $2 a gallon this time 2 years ago, OPEC was all but dissolved, now the Crown Prince & his Oil Rich Allies & OPEC are thriving thanks to 45,& now Americans are paying more at the pump, STEP UP DJT & LEAD! #ImpeachTrumpNow
1917 2018-10-10 20:26:35 Thanks mate. Although I have been more involved with Cad, Oil and Euro this week, so didn't take it LOL
1918 2018-10-10 20:26:34 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donny boy how about that stock market?  How about how the price of oil is going to skyrocket since your games with Iran?  How about how all your BS is catching up with you?  How about the FBI director admitting you limited the investigation into Kavanaugh?
1919 2018-10-10 20:26:30 I swear, every black person with natural hair swears they have a fucking miracle oil and hair routine. I don’t want to know your hair routine and I definitely do NOT need to see your hair journey photos that all look the same!!!
1920 2018-10-10 20:26:22 Rice mixed with beans with fresh red oil.
1921 2018-10-10 20:26:12 Royal purple is the best motor oil I have ever used .
It’s increased my performance and given me 3 more mpg, so I would say it’s worth the extra money
1922 2018-10-10 20:26:05 Not surprised due to Uzbekistan new role in South Asia since Shavkat Mirziyoyev was elected president in 2016. Also, Uzbekistan is rich in oil & gas, is 2nd largest country in S. Asia, surrounded by multiple borders, & an important ally to China & Russia & possibly Iran.
1923 2018-10-10 20:26:00 And you gotta sand it down too for the oil. Yeah it’s a false economy cheap paints. Lots of excellent water based trim products out there but that’s not one of them looks like
1924 2018-10-10 20:25:55 Evan, Sunday’s show ask why Ont & Que still buy Tanker Oil from Saudi’s? Ask why Ont & Que buy Tanker Oil from Venezuela’s Killer  Dictator? Ask bout a LNG Gas Pipeline explosion @ Prince George just days after BC OKd a 1000 mile LNG Pipeline & Kitamat Tanker Terminal. But no TMX
1925 2018-10-10 20:25:50 Oil lagao

1927 2018-10-10 20:25:45 it’s called grape seed oil. my face looks like shit so i have to take care of it.
1928 2018-10-10 20:25:39 $100 a barrel oil within the year!. #DrillBabyDrill
1929 2018-10-10 20:25:39 Why isn’t trump tweeting about the stock market dropping 600 points? He brags and takes credit for the market when it’s up!  Oil prices estimated to increase to 100$ barrel.
I wonder why????? any ideas???
1930 2018-10-10 20:25:36 Soph year history class my professor argued against the country switching to renewable energy sources because oil industry workers would lose their jobs. We were all like?!?¿¿??!? Should we not have switched to medicinal remedies so that witch doctors could keep their jobs?!?!?
1931 2018-10-10 20:25:15 Put coconut oil in my hair...it looks like a hot greasy mess
1932 2018-10-10 20:25:13 Diet is extremely personal, cultural, medical. There is no one size fits all solution. The one size fits all solution for fossil fuel emissions is to increase efficiency, tax environmental destruction, and invest heavily in renewable R&D. This hurts only oil/gas execs.
1933 2018-10-10 20:25:10  the oil doesn't belong to Scotland
1934 2018-10-10 20:25:09 Well we not bothered cos it's good. reasonable pple re spitting bars n making hit from diss song...unlike u who is now a pork farmer n wants to #Reign by recording a senseless diss track...you sure say ur wife dey feed u well? Cos only oil dey ur mind insyd..
1935 2018-10-10 20:25:04 Depends how much oil they have.
1936 2018-10-10 20:25:02 Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1937 2018-10-10 20:24:58 Ginger root tablets and/or peppermint oil helps me tremendously!
1938 2018-10-10 20:24:55 Limited resources right? Every current account that's isn't a salary account is taxed N50 for every deposit, They receive more from oil because of the higher exchange rate, the IGR made every month and the money borrowed. With all these, we are still limited?
1939 2018-10-10 20:24:53 I just wanna know what they are doing to my car that it has taken over an hour for them to change my oil
1940 2018-10-10 20:24:43 "Oh you did?" He asked, perking up considerably.

"Thank you.. The canteen food makes my stomach hurt. I think they use peanut oil.."

1942 2018-10-10 20:24:38 Many Gov Inslee could sell our oil back to us at the same as we sell it to him??
1943 2018-10-10 20:24:36 Oil is the lubricant of the engine of freedom. It's a beautiful thing. No negatives involved.
1944 2018-10-10 20:24:34 Nope but people do. And I have just been asked which I want... I have had fried noodles before tho, just too much oil but it’s not different from boiled.
1945 2018-10-10 20:24:28  cause I put this oil stuff in my hair to help keep it healthy and it says to put a bag over it to hold in the warm.... idk, I just did what it said!
1946 2018-10-10 20:24:25 I second that!
1947 2018-10-10 20:24:20 I need to go buy some coconut oil.
1948 2018-10-10 20:24:20 Someone taught me that if you oil your spatula they’ll flip perfectly!
1949 2018-10-10 20:24:18 u can taste oil if the foods oily enough
1950 2018-10-10 20:24:16 ﾌﾞｸﾛ2位か…………
1951 2018-10-10 20:24:14 If you look at these trends, most of the economic growth going on right now is actually the sale of tech stocks & the purchase of construction, mining, oil, gas, etc stocks. We are ungoing an economic realignment as the "startup economy" has proven to produce zero value or assets
1952 2018-10-10 20:24:11 Protests should erupt across all Saudi embassies around the world.  Lets not kneel down in front of oil money and muscle power
1953 2018-10-10 20:24:08 May I have low fat mayo?
If not I will make an olivie oil dressing with paprika, garlic & coriander (or maybe I already have )
1954 2018-10-10 20:24:07 black women hair do be smelling lit..

(tea tree and coconut oil LMAO)
1955 2018-10-10 20:24:02 Travesty!  New climate report... "we're all dead if we don't get off oil/gas" WTF is WRONG with you people?  ARE U INSANE? Tesla has 3 amazing all electric cars now while YOU continue polluting the world!
1956 2018-10-10 20:24:00 Oil slump 2% as Wall Street slide 800 points 
1957 2018-10-10 20:23:48 え、、知らん、、、
1958 2018-10-10 20:23:47 I used to think so, but I've recently learned that WW2 fascism just died because they didn't have access to enough oil.
1959 2018-10-10 20:23:43 Oil and NatGas won't go away. Oil is used to produce things other than energy; lubricants & asphalt, for example. NatGas is used to produce Helium and fertilizers. We will still need these products. Carbon tax and dividend is most efficient plan I've seen.
1960 2018-10-10 20:23:40 あﾞぁ！？
1961 2018-10-10 20:23:32 almost drank tea tree oil instead of cbd...someone help me.
1962 2018-10-10 20:23:25 Yes let's compare a small insignficant island nation with the #1 producer of oil and terrorism in the world. Brilliant! We get it you didn't like the black guy, now piss off.
1963 2018-10-10 20:23:23 Ну так это же круто. Намного лучше, чем всё предсказывать
1964 2018-10-10 20:23:16 Here in Australia, I’m looking at very core asset being down, including gold and silver & of course property. AUD down and oil up. Major expenses like fuel up... Not looking real good right now. My bottom is starting to quiver like a bunnies nose!
1965 2018-10-10 20:23:09 It's the olive oil for the top of the hummus you need to stick in your shed.
1966 2018-10-10 20:23:07 Tomatoes are fruits that are considered vegetables by nutritionists. So basically I still did good today!  just added a little oil!
1967 2018-10-10 20:23:06 Joe loves anything negative in this country so he can blame trump...why are they declining Joe? Rising rates to cool a booming economy to protect against inflation. Rising oil prices because trump is trying to keep Iran from a nuclear weapon. Tell the whole truth for once
1968 2018-10-10 20:22:59 SAExploration wants to start seismic oil testing in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge this Dec.The 90K lbs "thumper trucks" which do the testing send powerful seismic waves deep into the earth.These waves crush everything in their paths—including polar bear dens.#CleanEnergy NOW
1969 2018-10-10 20:22:48 Girl why you tasting oil 
1970 2018-10-10 20:22:45 Exactly. We also use only olive oil, measured in spoons, not cups. 
1971 2018-10-10 20:22:40 It’s not a story. It’s discounted for a couple of reasons. Mainly due to the oil being “illegal and traders buying it from KRG  at discounted price. There is a also pipeline fee for use of pipeline on Turkish side. Brent is a benchmark not an actual price.
1972 2018-10-10 20:22:36 У меня от первых 10 слов сердце выскочило. Хорошо, что застряло в горле
1973 2018-10-10 20:22:34 We're very pleased with your results, too :)
1974 2018-10-10 20:22:31 I recently replaced my old oil boiler with electric heating from hopefully what is renewable sources. I couldn't afford a deep retrofit even with grants so  I'll be crippled with high electricity costs. It's depressing
1975 2018-10-10 20:22:20 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
1976 2018-10-10 20:22:20 I think with Scottish oil, it needs its own currency.
1977 2018-10-10 20:22:19 ##DOW Profits up 20% over 2017. Trump $4T tax cuts 2018 add profits windfall 20%. So no real growth 2018. Markets know: 2019 profits will fall, Fed rates rising, oil costs up, Trump artificial tax windfall over, EMEs in crisis, China slowing, etc. I repeat: US recession late 2019
1978 2018-10-10 20:22:18 The bond notes were their first answers to section A of the psyc evaluation, now the 2%is from section B so rate them wega usi g cooking oil as your economic culculator
1979 2018-10-10 20:22:05 Obama allowed offshore drilling even after deepwater horizon disaster, making the US the number one oil producer.  Like a good Republican would do.  He was the renowned Deporter in Chief too.  Didn't get anything meaningful done with regards to financial reforms either.
1980 2018-10-10 20:22:02 These stir fry noodles were so banging but too oily I need to relax with the oil next time but for now, nice comfort meal with my wine and tears
1981 2018-10-10 20:21:55 @saudiarabia has never felt badly about jacking up the price of oil. So if they want to buy arms from the US, they should tell the world what happened to Jamal Khashoggi at their embassy in Turkey. Till then, the @USSenate shouldn’t sell them even a single rock to throw.
1982 2018-10-10 20:21:48 Да, интрига неимоверная, но на самом деле мозг взрывается настолько часто, что ты просто охyeваешь от происходящего. И сидишь такой с лицом лица с вопросом в голове: "6лядь, что?" И нихера не понимаешь, как это всё вообще вылилось в то, что вылилось.
1983 2018-10-10 20:21:35 How is it our top officials never read about facts of global warming before while the entire world has been screaming that fact to them? Must of been big oil money blurring their vision till now.
1984 2018-10-10 20:21:29 A large reduction in oil and fossil fuel consumption is also needed if we are to save the planet.
1985 2018-10-10 20:21:20 beets only taste good roasted in olive oil and salt! totally gets rid of the pond flavor
1986 2018-10-10 20:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1987 2018-10-10 20:21:09 Mood: In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups flour. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. Punch dough down. Bake at 375° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped.

Tip: I always carry a bottle of cold water and lavender essential oil when I’m out doing errands. It helps to take a sip when I’m feeling suffocated and brings me back to earth. Dabbing lavender oil on my wrists helps to ground me

1991 2018-10-10 20:20:36 peanuts and treenuts! and most chinese food will use peanut oil and like the egg rolls are usually closed with peanut butter and stuff !
1992 2018-10-10 20:20:36 Although, I do agree with you. A barrel of oil produces 2% gas; the other 98% is byproducts like plastic.  Oil is used in everything.
1993 2018-10-10 20:20:33 @DavidAsmanfox @FoxBusiness David I still owe you dinner we can  about the speculation and oil prices that we spoke about many years ago
On a few of my Fox Interviews- also   after trading through Katrina this is only the beginning-
1994 2018-10-10 20:20:33 Hurricane Michael on Wednesday cut 42 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico daily crude oil production and nearly a third of natural gas output, the largest reductions in a year, after companies evacuated staff and shut-in platforms as a precaution.
1995 2018-10-10 20:20:24 UPSIDE DOWN world!!His administration attacked Iraq under FALSE pretexts! 4 a WAR benefiting Israel & oil CORPORATIONS etc. Killing million Iraqis & resulting in 1000s of veterans killed. YET, he is awarded a PRIZE?Wow!! Maybe Dick Cheney SHOULD get the noble price 4 peace2?
1996 2018-10-10 20:20:17 There are many variables potentially create the next global economic turmoil:
- China's debt growth
- The Fed's increasing rate
- Corporate debt
- Quitaly
- The rising of crude oil price
1997 2018-10-10 20:19:58 Some meme said it better. But here is a movie pitch. A plucky band of oil and gas barons/billionaires uncover a plot by non-profit scientists to hoax the world about climate change.
1998 2018-10-10 20:19:49 In my experience all high end skincare is bullshit excited the Sunday Riley UFO oil
1999 2018-10-10 20:19:47 The oil paint on the wall is so smooth.  The painter is good.
2000 2018-10-10 20:19:39 Why is it down ding dong? Rising interest rates due to booming economic growth, along with oil prices up due in part to trump clamping down on Iran’s nuclear program. Both wins. Obama never had to deal with rising rates since his economy never grew like this
2001 2018-10-10 20:19:27 We really just need to move to FACTS and stop talking sides on this. There is only ONE planet earth! 

& yes, those that profit off the big business of fossil fuels are going to LIE to us, until all the dinosaur oil is out of the ground! By then, it will be too late to SOS..
2002 2018-10-10 20:19:25 #DarkCosmos .. Prayers to the devil whom you represent cant save #EvilNigeria. Every election in Nigeria won by a #Fulani rigged or not is a plus to the scheming #Yorubas to keep #OneNigeria running for their oil interests in #BightOfBiafra.

Friends, remember the #WTI & #brent #petroleum prices of mid-2016.

Now compare them with the current ones.

Without fear of error, I suspect that the quarterly Balanses of the entire oil sector will give us many joys in this Christmas

2024 2018-10-10 20:17:34 New breaks and oil pan = gold pass.

2028 2018-10-10 20:17:16 People who cook with oil are brave souls
2029 2018-10-10 20:17:13 Forget the scramble for cooking oil, go and by a bulletproof vest, the streets ain't safe anymore. 

You may thank me someday, but, hopefully not.
2030 2018-10-10 20:17:12 why the heck did my oil change take over an hour and a half!?!?!??!!! excuse me
2031 2018-10-10 20:17:10 이 시간에 자면 뭐하나

2036 2018-10-10 20:16:53 I agree about climate change, but we don’t need to be using oil for fuel anymore, the problem with all govts is they make too much money from oil
2037 2018-10-10 20:16:49 Remember when you said you called Saudi Arabia and told them to increase production because oil was too expensive? Maybe you should call wall street and tell them your shutting down all trading until we can figure out what the hell is going on! Your wrecking a good economy dude!
2038 2018-10-10 20:16:44 And fossil fuels are killing our planet? Oil and gas etc are just chillin in the geologic formations. The human race can’t live without fossil fuels as renewable energy sources CANT deliver feasible base load power. What do you think we should do?
2039 2018-10-10 20:16:43 약 먹어도..
2040 2018-10-10 20:16:41 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
2041 2018-10-10 20:16:39 Everyone who said “coconut oil fixes everything” like 3 years ago now has coronary heart disease
2042 2018-10-10 20:16:38 And auto insurance doesn't cover maintainece or oil changes etc.
2043 2018-10-10 20:16:38 so it's all trump on up days, never his fault on crashes... billbot, your brain needs some oil ... #embarrassing

2046 2018-10-10 20:16:25 Yeah, lazy little bastards. Turns out you need to refill the feed bowl and oil the wheel occasionally. Who knew? 
2047 2018-10-10 20:16:15 おはようございます
2048 2018-10-10 20:16:05 Saudis should stop oil shipments for a month. See whom owns who.

2051 2018-10-10 20:15:45 Not quite, but there's nothing on the label of a Coke that states how much pollution your responsible for when you buy it.

And the oil companies did in fact lie about climate change for decades.

2054 2018-10-10 20:15:31 But on a positive note trump has to scratch the “Dow is better than ever” part of his snake oil blather.
2055 2018-10-10 20:15:28 Bare minimum, at most a Tbsp, that too olive oil 
2056 2018-10-10 20:15:28 Never trust an oil company. They are playing a long game.
2057 2018-10-10 20:15:23 Dude get your oil changed haha
2058 2018-10-10 20:15:09 Can we see before pics please.. 
You look awesome. but did you always look great?
2059 2018-10-10 20:14:58 I am old school Lahori.... and this is our go to dish.
Ours has oil on top, just a bit, garnished with garam masala and onion salad. Darn I am hungry now.
2060 2018-10-10 20:14:57 strategic/////x  Cook in your own oil
2061 2018-10-10 20:14:56 I went all in on oil & gas over a decade ago when I set up my portfolio.  I am now an expert on stock market butthurt.  Just ask.
2062 2018-10-10 20:14:53 Amazing what high oil prices for decades can accomplish!! Great to see our gas $$$ at work!!
2063 2018-10-10 20:14:49 Well Will
2064 2018-10-10 20:14:42 Yeah, that’s about it. To get the climate back to where the ice caps aren’t melting we’ll have to undo every bit of oil, coal, and gas burned since the 80s, roughly. Every litre of gas I burn, one of my descendants will have to pay to remove.
2065 2018-10-10 20:14:41 My heart hurts just spent damn near close to $700 to fill my oil tank.. adulting is stupid
2066 2018-10-10 20:14:32 Because they are after Israel's oil.
2067 2018-10-10 20:14:28 On a nice day like today I’m spending it at Walmart waiting for an oil change....
2068 2018-10-10 20:14:28 Libyan girs  get a car & never check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, nothing... they just wake up and drive that thing   #thelibyanclub #libya
2069 2018-10-10 20:13:59 strategic/
Do not fall into anyone's backyard
Make your own oil, your own salt - in your own kitchen
2070 2018-10-10 20:13:38 It’s funny when crypto people assume that they understand things they don’t. 

For USD to lose reserve currency status there would have to be a viable alternative. For a while back in 2008 people talked about the euro (and oil was being bought in euros!).

We know how that ended
2071 2018-10-10 20:13:10 Keep up the good work. We have lots invested in renewables and get to buy oil assets so cheap. Your argument about doing something in spite of our tax not making any meaningful difference is great cause some lots of folks are buying it. Great for our cause
2072 2018-10-10 20:13:08 Popeye and Olive Oil.
2073 2018-10-10 20:13:02 ginger root tea , peppermint tea , or add a spoonful of coconut oil to any hot tea...my grandma uses these and they always work pretty well.
2074 2018-10-10 20:13:02 Bitch I cook my food in coconut oil, what u got on me? (jk I would accept an olive oil cookin hoe)
2075 2018-10-10 20:13:01 Meanwhile the #IdiotInChief wants to destory Virginia beaches to pay off his oil benefactors
2076 2018-10-10 20:13:00 I love the way the oil smells on my skin after a massage
2077 2018-10-10 20:12:54 yall ever tasted oil

А там рассказывается про род Рейсс и Аккерман.
2081 2018-10-10 20:12:42 I don't remember the Carter oil crisis and I never will.
2082 2018-10-10 20:12:42 it's not banned here, and yes, the flavor will most definitely be different :) which do you prefer? I like mustard oil a lot, but was wondering if it'd be overpowering.
2083 2018-10-10 20:12:41 Only in the Oil sector!
2084 2018-10-10 20:12:34 Sure, we're in a bowl! Our natural storm protection was eliminated at the turn of the century during the industrial age. They wiped out the cypress trees to build and didn't replenish them!  Now, the oil industry has had it's affect on our coastline, as well. #SaveOurCoast
2085 2018-10-10 20:12:29 Methane. ethane, and maybe butane are not quite "oil"....Both oil and natural gas are compositions of numerous HC types....Each one is different.
2086 2018-10-10 20:12:22 Wood, gas, oil and coal is though
2087 2018-10-10 20:12:08 New breaks 385$, new starter 290$, change car tires 30$, oil change 70$ but I love my car. Vroom vroom
2088 2018-10-10 20:12:05 Oil exploration & distillation is not my field of expertise.
My energy research stems from benefits and limitations of end uses of oil and coal.
2089 2018-10-10 20:12:03 Freedom doesn’t exist, there’s always restrictions. So, America’s Armed Forces are not fighting for your “freedom,” they’re fighting for G.O.D. (Gold, Oil, Drugs.)
2090 2018-10-10 20:11:46 Without oil. Guilt free eating. I normally eat qeema wrapped in roti, like a burrito. This looks perfect.
2091 2018-10-10 20:11:39 Red oil poured on your bed abi you go tear leather???
2092 2018-10-10 20:11:34 People thought it was going to cause crude oil to spike up too....it didn't
2093 2018-10-10 20:11:29 Love this oil slick vibe on the eyes. So great!
2094 2018-10-10 20:11:29 Any idea whats happened to oil platforms in the Gulf?  Must be a nightmare out there...
2095 2018-10-10 20:11:21 Grow up @PhoenixRead.  Trump is a  con man grifter that has never even seen the inside of a bus or a subway.  Clearly you enjoy drinking snake oil.
2096 2018-10-10 20:11:20 Give it a clean its covered in oil!

2101 2018-10-10 20:10:58 Tell the major oil companies to go fly a kite and Make Sasol produce and sell Petrol in this country only
2102 2018-10-10 20:10:32 Hemp straws and water bottles? Hemp forks, knives, spoons? Does a molten salt reactor that you can grill you sausages over supply enough power to replace an oil or coal electricity plant?
2103 2018-10-10 20:10:20 Ummmm no that baby oil...LMAO
2104 2018-10-10 20:10:19 I got an oil change, went to the gym, ran two miles at the park, and now I’m studying for my peds final. I love productive days 
2105 2018-10-10 20:10:19 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
2106 2018-10-10 20:10:16 Yeah all gels flake up eventually. I recommend sealing it with an oil so that it doesn’t flake or get hard & crunchy
2107 2018-10-10 20:10:15 "Your hair looks nice . You should put some oil in it" 
If it looks good . Why should I do anything?? 
Anyway . Whatever . I love it has it is .

Have you actually met any coppers?
2110 2018-10-10 20:09:47 Pay day yesterday... so I treated myself to a new toothbrush, expensive tooth paste and some coconut oil to look after my teeth. Such a grown up.
2111 2018-10-10 20:09:21 Soon as I leave from getting this oil change and from the gun store I’m bout to do that all day
2112 2018-10-10 20:09:12 Hmmmm iwewe unenge wakutoda muspecial class. That will cost you 3 x 2liters of Pure drop cooking oil, 4 kgs flour and 500g iodised salt
2113 2018-10-10 20:09:09 Asteroid and comets - same thing apart from the charge differential....but Let's stick to oil ! See what I did there ? - Are full of oil.
2114 2018-10-10 20:09:00 The money trump pockets from oil companies will cost the earth. Fact.
2115 2018-10-10 20:08:50 oil
2116 2018-10-10 20:08:50 Thankful that I wasn’t stubborn this morning.  Took my losses first 15 minutes of the day and got an oil change.
2117 2018-10-10 20:08:44 "It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just Gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces" -Lincoln, ....Yet let these millennials travel to Venezuela, most oil wealthy nation on earth as they starve while the elites eat their bread
2118 2018-10-10 20:08:43 it can people just need to become aware that we can do it but we need to spend less on defence and wars and more on pushing the technology boundaries, unfortunately at present the oil mongers don't want us to.
2119 2018-10-10 20:08:38 Found some old hummus? Add olive oil! Now it tastes like shit covered in oil.
2120 2018-10-10 20:08:33 Appreciate your blog detailing #oil #price effects #economy

Unfortunately #market ignores long term depletion cost:

- #energy market share think stock prices

- stranded assets think loss depreciation/#productivity

Both impeding #RenewableEnergy

2122 2018-10-10 20:08:17 Taking measures that increase the price of oil is just carbon pricing, i.e. a carbon tax, by other means. If the cost of litre of gasoline doubles, people will use less of it where they can. The reasons why the price of gasoline doubles are not relevant to the buying behavior.
2123 2018-10-10 20:08:06 having a boyfriend to do things with is so cool lmao wanna eat? take a nap? see a movie? go to the bank? go grocery shopping? get a oil change? he’s there

2125 2018-10-10 20:07:56 And when Democrats call for investigations into possible price gouging by these oil/gas companies @GOP @FoxNews turn around & call them Socialists & anyone protesting price gouging immediately becomes part of an “angry lawless socialist mob”!
That’s the Republican Party for you!
2126 2018-10-10 20:07:45 Я забила после того, как началась арка про войну людей за *спойлер*, ну там где ещё баба шла с поднятыми руками типа сдаваться, с динамитом привязанным к ноге. Я просто поняла, что дело пахнет жареным, и если и собираюсь дочитывать, то только после полного выхода манги.
2127 2018-10-10 20:07:43 Yes - that’s true. The argument does have some merit. But it’s a balance right and I’m not sure how we could address the underlying infrastructure issues without regime change....and there ain’t enough crude oil left for that...
2128 2018-10-10 20:07:27 We are going to have a dilemma about using and selling our oil and protecting the environment. Just saying.
2129 2018-10-10 20:06:51 It’s been much more important to the world due to life, moving to another planet, satellites etc. Other than oil, I don’t see the importance of exploring the deep ocean. Most animals that live that deep can’t be brought to the surface

2132 2018-10-10 20:06:42 You guys seem to forget... the oil industry is the third largest COUNTRY, in terms of revenue... trillions... these fuck are behind a lot of this... Don't kid yourselves... they are fighting dirty, just like they've done with climate change, for decades now
2133 2018-10-10 20:06:41 The Petroleum Law of 1958 (and the amendment of Art. 27 in 1960) were perverse in denying the State the right to issue oil contracts directly. The Energy Reform of 2013-14 restored this right to the State, but without relitigating (and demolishing) the arguments of 1958-60.
2134 2018-10-10 20:06:40 Lmaooooo stop!!!!! Then gone be like you need a stress oil? I gotchu boo. You know I does it all! 
2135 2018-10-10 20:06:38 Correction, our taxes hardly change, it's OPEC whose prices stay doing us dirty. So JZ could get us oil at a cheaper price to what OPEC charges, avoiding fuel hikes.
2136 2018-10-10 20:06:16 I think its just strange to someone from Ireland bc every house has one and using microwaves to bloil water sounds weird,,

2148 2018-10-10 20:04:14 And now that there is another natural disaster the oil companies are going to raise the gas and oil prices because they're greedy this crap has got to stop gas should not be but a dollar a gallon
2149 2018-10-10 20:04:05 Did you use oil?
2150 2018-10-10 20:04:01 Don’t believe views of “progressive activists”are far away from “average” Americans!
-going after oil/gas companies for price gouging
-moderating prescription drug prices; buying in bulk to lower costs
-fuel efficiency standards
-bank/wall st safeguards

2156 2018-10-10 20:03:24 You realize that Chavez was in office for the vast majority of that graph, right? Seems like most of his tenure was pretty stable. 

Y’know, I wonder if there were any external factors that may have affected their economy... something like collapsing oil prices in 2013?

2163 2018-10-10 20:02:27 Tea tree oil especially the one from @thebodyshopusa
2164 2018-10-10 20:02:15 Damn what has america come to when politicians blatantly want to tax Clean EVs and remove incentives for buying them... like damn @SenJohnBarrasso how much are the big oil companies paying you to kill ya future grandkids
2165 2018-10-10 20:02:09 It doesn't have to be just a theory. If you understand how oil is formed you could become extremely rich.
2166 2018-10-10 20:02:03 General Cárdenas made a mountain out of a molehill in expropriating the oil industry over a wage dispute. Hello? A wage dispute? He did not consider that MX would instantly lose 90% of the intellectual capital needed for exploration. MX would be a net oil importer for 20 years.
2167 2018-10-10 20:02:01 @redstocks $90 oil will do that. Now they're not getting any boost from
 $70 oil. That's coming, though
2168 2018-10-10 20:01:55 Coloured eyeliner and good quality facial oil (I have acne prone skin and I’ve found pure argan oil is my dream moisturiser)
2169 2018-10-10 20:01:50 I swear my hair eats up oil like I done put so much oil on my hair just over these two days and it’s still dry 
2170 2018-10-10 20:01:48 I’m not American but I would find it a significant conflict of interest to be taking $400k from an oil company and then bringing legislation to suppress non oil based competition. Are there no rules on this?
2171 2018-10-10 20:01:30 There grown men that don’t know how to do an oil change or change brakes
2172 2018-10-10 20:01:28 We’re working hard! If anyone has an extra $5.00, please donate to @BetoORourke . He’s funded completely by us out here, while Cruz has huge economic support from NRA,  the oil industry, & big business.

2174 2018-10-10 20:01:18 She should remember Scotland subsidises England a fact they deny but will become apparent after Independence. No more free oil, gas, electricity, water. Nowhere to harbour their nukes etc etc etc. In short missus get it up yer !!
2175 2018-10-10 20:01:17 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet much else.
2176 2018-10-10 20:01:11 Vegetable oil is in my cabinet, on my floors and on my counters because fucking Flynnan is mad after breakfast.
2177 2018-10-10 20:01:07 Fellow Twimbo's
Apart from Fuel and Cooking Oil ,what do you want right now
#Zimcrisis #FindFuelZw
2178 2018-10-10 20:00:52 Don't they just get all their money from the NR, Oil, Pharmaceutical, Insurance, and Coal companies?

2182 2018-10-10 20:00:27 A Tesla pollutes more than oil car. It consumes 3x more energy to produce amd impossible to recycle. Total BS
2183 2018-10-10 20:00:23 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
2184 2018-10-10 20:00:22 Almost 4,000,000 mi² to Norways 150,000 mi² and 5x our pop density, is no comparison! Not sure you can compare any other countries mass to Canada other than Russia, they’ve been giving the finger to the world about oil production and it seems to work for them.
2185 2018-10-10 20:00:15 My cats will literally bite holes in my vegetable oil container NO MATTER WHERE IT IS and will dump it all over the floor. Why? For one lick.

Не, ну Мегамозга я просто не могла не упомянуть, хоть режьте. А планета сокровищ навсегда засела в моём сердечке.
2188 2018-10-10 20:00:03 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2189 2018-10-10 20:00:03 Got some new DADDIES changing my oil today it’s a great day all around
2190 2018-10-10 20:00:02 U r on a dead mission. I suggest focusing on kicking out terrerists frm ur county. Ogaden is as much ethiopian as Addis Ababa. Give freedom to somaliland and treat your somali bantus better. We are working on developing our somali region and more so now that we found oil there.
2191 2018-10-10 20:00:01 Saka zvandanga ndiri kuda kuroora muna December zvatodirwa majecha kaizvi ka $5000 kanogona kakutenga 2 litres ye cooking oil chete
2192 2018-10-10 19:59:56 There was no cooking oil, juices (Mazowe, Ballyhouse, Quench & Squish squash) and  Rambawarairas in the supermarkets like OK and Choppies.  @Busisa74
2193 2018-10-10 19:59:55 I was hoping Valvoline would mess up my oil change like last time so I could get another free one, but they didn’t 
2194 2018-10-10 19:59:55 My car changed its own oil, while listening to the Healer 
2195 2018-10-10 19:59:48 So, Donald, you really need to see a doctor regarding your lack of empathy. I'm just wondering how many 'storms of the century' we have to endure before the GOP recognizes the dangers of Global Warming. Your money from oil, gas & coal won't save you if the Earth dies.
2196 2018-10-10 19:59:42 Hi, Sandra. My son, Mikal recommended you. I'm interested in getting the cbd oil. Here's my contact info: valerie.s.mccloud@gmail.com,  804-240-0148. Thanks.
2197 2018-10-10 19:59:42 CBD! I came off my medication for anxiety about 6 months ago, and since have been using CBD (oil, honey, gummies, etc) and it works wonders. Way better than pharmaceuticals
2198 2018-10-10 19:59:36 i recommend olaplex and coconut oil
2199 2018-10-10 19:59:22 finally got my oil changed yikes i can finally drive without fear
2200 2018-10-10 19:59:16 If it was written by an oil company he would believe it
2201 2018-10-10 19:59:09 Gold diggers dig until they find oil 
2202 2018-10-10 19:59:04 Oregano oil
2203 2018-10-10 19:59:04 anyone recommend any setting spray or powder etc for oily skin cause I’m tired of looking like sunflower oil half way through the day
2204 2018-10-10 19:58:59 Epal nyo sinabi na nga ng pangulo na he consider suspending excise tax on oil tapos andto na naman kayo umeepal tapos pag gnawa ng pangulo kunyare nanggaling sa inyo credit grab na naman or grabbing idea lol
2205 2018-10-10 19:58:58 おー！すごいのてす
2206 2018-10-10 19:58:57 It's the ambience of these old machines, the smell of leather, petrol and oil, a row of dials and little toggle switches and the sound of the exhaust

I felt like I was taking off to shoot down ME190s over the Home Counties
2207 2018-10-10 19:58:52 My skin feels so soft, Whatever oil they used I need that 
2208 2018-10-10 19:58:51 I could be your oil boy  x
2209 2018-10-10 19:58:41 Thanks oil industry
2210 2018-10-10 19:58:19 specs could be in trouble here, oil could drop decently after eia tomorow saving on margin calls. This could bring the 60 and the 50s back into play
2211 2018-10-10 19:58:15 Oh it will!  Best facial oil I have found!
2212 2018-10-10 19:57:50 At a $50 a barrel discount because we can’t get our oil to market. Based on that logic, Canada has the greenest energy policy in the world.
2213 2018-10-10 19:57:42 Shrimp and pasta is good, but if you toss the pasta with garlic, red pepper, quartered cherry tomatoes, black pepper, olive oil, and spinach it becomes really good.
2214 2018-10-10 19:57:39 Wean ur self off with just coconut oil
2215 2018-10-10 19:57:35 And I still don't know why the Senate under SARAKI should be considering it even when oil prices have gone beyond $80
2216 2018-10-10 19:57:25 I'll oil u up
2217 2018-10-10 19:57:18 Girls don’t neva change the oil in they car
2218 2018-10-10 19:57:03 Oils are amazing Lavender for the skin has grapeseed oil / peppermint good for aches and soul just oils in general are life changing I never knew how wonderful oils are 
2219 2018-10-10 19:56:57 Lunch today:  molotes, a corn dough half-moon empanada fried crispy & light in oil.  One was stuffed w/ tinga de pollo, slathered in red salsa & crema; other was stuffed w huitlacoche-a corn mushroom, covered in green salsa & crema. Puebla, your gastronomic delights are profound.
2220 2018-10-10 19:56:39 Bread and palm oil, super nice and nourishing
2221 2018-10-10 19:56:38 Same here. My edges are in ICU. hopefully that hair growth shit works. Been using the Jamaican castor oil. I need something faster
2222 2018-10-10 19:56:30 These junk plans are just snake oil being sold to gullible citizens. Shame on you for voting in favor of this!

2223 2018-10-10 19:56:28 Do I know any medical professionals who can advise whether you can just get olbas oil inhaler implants straight into your nostrils on the nhs
2224 2018-10-10 19:56:23 face oil
2225 2018-10-10 19:56:22 #GasPrices should start to pick up downward momentum after today's worries over a global slow down hit oil markets hard, with the *exception* of the Pacific Northwest (Cali could be drawn in as well), where a natural gas pipeline outage is putting refineries at risk of shutdown.
2226 2018-10-10 19:56:20 PUTIN ILL SELL YOU THE OIL AT THE LOWEST PRICE PER BAREL I HAVE NO TIME LEFT
2227 2018-10-10 19:56:19 The level of carbon taxes required to mitigate the climate damage would incentivize setting up a black market. Already happens with e.g. Iraqi and Iranian oil during sanctions.
2228 2018-10-10 19:56:17 I don’t have a decent figure to oil myself m10  imma go with no
2229 2018-10-10 19:55:57 SCAM! Walang epekto tong SNAKE OIL nila! Mga walang hiya mga tao nsa likod nito, nabubuhay sa panloloko ng kapwa!
2230 2018-10-10 19:55:57 Damn my oil change light come on every week fuck
2231 2018-10-10 19:55:50 Power outages from Hurricane Michael could last weeks +++ Great news deplorables...this means you can burn even more coal and oil,  Trump will love you for helping the Mega-gas companies rake in even more $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...life is good...right you morons?
2232 2018-10-10 19:55:35 Oil
2233 2018-10-10 19:55:34 Govt estimates: 42% of crude oil production & 32% of natural gas production in Gulf of Mexico is shut down ahead of Hurricane Michael.
2234 2018-10-10 19:55:30 My girl buying me an essential oil diffuser is just another example of how she improves my life. My room smells like caramel
2235 2018-10-10 19:55:24 My Wife wants “original artwork” for her birthday. Well, Isn’t that just great.                                                    OK hunny, challenge accepted.  Oil painting for beginners kit is on its way. Let’s do this.
2236 2018-10-10 19:55:11 I’ve been diffusing Bergamot today for stress! What’s your go to stress oil? 
2237 2018-10-10 19:55:04 I strained the pasta , I had fresh garlic sitting in a different pan with the olive oil, then put the ingredients to make the sauce in that and let the crab marinate in that then strained the water and mixed it all
2238 2018-10-10 19:55:03 훈제 하시니까 오리훈제고기 먹고싶어짐
2239 2018-10-10 19:55:02 Congrats to oil shills for helping to destroy our environment for greed. Now us the time to transition towards clean renewable energy. 12 years until it is too late. #refineatthesource lower domestic prices. Pollution is not a hoax.
2240 2018-10-10 19:54:55 NCST ，change the name STR oil
2241 2018-10-10 19:54:50 I don't oil myself huge T that would be counterproductive, do you oil yourself giant T?
2242 2018-10-10 19:54:41 Who is fooling who here?

2L cooking oil now costs $15, in Mpopoma shops 
 the manufacturers haven't increased their prices.
2243 2018-10-10 19:54:37 @EdmundKudzayi @MthuliNcube Pls dont b  snake oil salesman.
2244 2018-10-10 19:54:23 I did, and yes, saying "25 oil and gas companies are responsible for 50% of emissions!" as if we could just boycott the petroleum industry is not really a very helpful observation.
2245 2018-10-10 19:54:20 Top four oil producing countries in the world are US, Saudi, Russia and China and and there we have the climate change denier Brexit/Trump connection.
2246 2018-10-10 19:54:09 Related, serious and curious question.  How many years of CO2 sequestration as oil are we undoing per year?  Some numbers:

900BBL taken already
1700BBL proven reserves now
53y left at today's rate
Possible oil reserves uncertain?
Oil=fossilized algae.  Algae arrived ~850mya
2247 2018-10-10 19:53:50 Have these in hand today !! for people who don’t order online or like waiting !They go fast also have several people stocked with oil also if anyone wants today !!
2248 2018-10-10 19:53:47 Yeah, I think my sweet potatoes and broccoli are addictive.  
.
Always the issue with the low carb crowd - lumping all carbs into the same category.  Sorry but now all carbs are the same.  I lost 168lbs. on a HIGH CARB diet.  Just no processed crap food. #WFPB No Oil!
2249 2018-10-10 19:53:44 Strain the pasta and crush some fresh garlic and toss some olive oil in the pot after on low heat for like 2 mins
2250 2018-10-10 19:53:27 god I tried putting hot oil in my food bc my boss was like the chow mein is good w it and like yea it's good as hell but I'm a weak white bitch and was dyin
2251 2018-10-10 19:53:26 Oil
2252 2018-10-10 19:53:21 That fool better get used to pressing his own olive oil and baked focaccia and Italian sundried tomatoes in his backyard because Joe is going back to Italia. And I doubt Teresa goes with him.
2253 2018-10-10 19:53:18 To oil yourself up you mad bastard
2254 2018-10-10 19:53:07 He claims Ethereum is as decentralized as Bitcoin. Snake oil
2255 2018-10-10 19:52:58 I then had a chat with my sister a chef by professional and she was saying kubasa kwavo they are no longer taking orders of fresh chips coz hakuna enough cooking oil
2256 2018-10-10 19:52:54 Railroads -5%
Oil Equipment & Services -5.85%
2257 2018-10-10 19:52:51 Care to enlighten me on how purchasing oil at an increased price from country’s that whole heartedly neglect climate change is a fix to the issue I am presenting? Or does Canadian climate change differ in magnitude to these other nations? #SincereQuestion
2258 2018-10-10 19:52:50 Why lavender oil, medicine, even accoustic songs and rainy sounds cant help. 
2259 2018-10-10 19:52:50 I am not failing your questions, because you have no authority asks me questions - and at no point have you touched the issue at hand, the threat to orangutans and the collapse of their populations, largely driven by the clearing of forests for commercial palm oil production
2260 2018-10-10 19:52:42 Of course a factor in the U.S. reluctance to move past fossil fuel is the fact that the U.S. is the world's oil trading currency, the petrodollar. War on the horizon because of that petrodollar status as well.
No pol really wants to discuss that factor 
2261 2018-10-10 19:52:41 Lmao so @Twitter locked my account bc of a 4 year old tweet between me and @ovenotter.

Twitter is a fucking joke. Nazis run rampant, but me telling a fake otter on the internet that an oil spill should take him is "crossing the line"

Eat moldy dog shit, Twitter.
2262 2018-10-10 19:52:39 Yessss my first thought! Go with virgin coconut oil if you're  hard pressed but no scented mineral oils yikes. Please take care 
2263 2018-10-10 19:52:36 Are they raising oil at the CCM to benefit RUSSIA and SAUDI ARABIA at the expense of "we the people"? Is this what PUTIN wants?
2264 2018-10-10 19:52:34 I'm guessing they don't mention nationalizing and dismantling oil companies?
2265 2018-10-10 19:52:34 And they want you to vote no. I think you’re confused. The Oil and Gas people want the no vote on 112.
2266 2018-10-10 19:52:22 When in doubt, hammer a screwdriver through your oil filter and use it as leverage to break the seal on the gasket. 
NEVER overtighten an oil filter and always use fresh oil on new oil filter gasket to lube the threading.
2267 2018-10-10 19:52:17 Raw pls. But grated carrot could probs also work as a quick lunch supplement. But of oil and orange peel and chill in the microwave or so. Like pumpkin spaghetti. Np root veg shall be safe in autumn.
2268 2018-10-10 19:52:14 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
2269 2018-10-10 19:52:11 Don’t know how well sprayed peppermint oil works if it’s diluted.. We found only the pure and best essence worked. We also placed down baby powder along cracks in the pavement outside. Worked well, but of course after rain had to put more down.
2270 2018-10-10 19:51:53 I didn’t chop off all my hair, stopped relaxing my hair a year ago, I deep condition my hair weekly if I don’t have anything plaited, shea butter and castor oil my hair every night. Protein treatment once a month. You need to make sure your hair stays moisturized. Goodluck
2271 2018-10-10 19:51:45 @oye_bobs I eat sugar cane with Palm oil 
2272 2018-10-10 19:51:44 It's a bit more complex... but I will try. Let's say u have a lucrative palm oil biz, and lived well fro this biz income.

U have excess staff in ur house as helps, in order to help ur village pipu. 

If d palm oil biz crashes... What will happen to ur staff?
2273 2018-10-10 19:51:43 God bless tea tree oil for an instant relief for stress pimples 
2274 2018-10-10 19:51:30 Try the Carol’s daughter shampoo for wash, an Moroccan argan oil to condition, rinse with cold water, use palm full of the conditioner as leave in, add rose water for hydration, deva curl curl defining creme, deva curl arc angel gel and use a DENMAN BRUSH(best ever) to brush all
2275 2018-10-10 19:51:21 《オリーブ油豆知識》

2276 2018-10-10 19:51:07 Trump-Russia-Saudi is entitlement all the way down:

- Trump base born light-skinned, think they can thus seize US as minority faction
- Trump born in crooked biz fam
- MbS born in chieftain fam
- Putin, MbS inherited oil in ground
2277 2018-10-10 19:51:04 Let me read GRAIN all the way through but one thing to note is that Scope 1 & 2 in the report are about energy use in animal product production facilities- if that is coal/gas/oil then it overlaps with the CMR in which 90% of their carbon footprint comes from consumption...
2278 2018-10-10 19:51:02 Undertand that i said low resources, and that was due to short fall in global crude oil market check the records man, and thanks to your vermins whom got us here.
2279 2018-10-10 19:50:59 With its sugar-now & unstimulative budget, its insane & corrupt marriage to Saud, it's financial system's vulnerability to the oil complex, US setting itself up for weak currency/big deficit conundrum so typical of dictatorships. Have u gamed a collapse in crude @DeanBaker13 ?
2280 2018-10-10 19:50:56 지인이 내가 모에 그림체면 다 좋아하는줄 알았는데 생각 외로 그림체 가리고 모에체 중에서도 마지악한 취향인거 깨닫고 자꾸 모에체 들고 와서 이건 취향이냐 이건 어떠냐 물어보면서 내 취향 조사 하는디 글쎄..나도 내 취향 잘 몰라..(긁적
2281 2018-10-10 19:50:35 I got an oil change (finally) and the guy checked my filter thats behind my glove box and told me that he once took out a filter that had a goofball size bug nest in it and sooooo I’m never driving a car ever again basically
2282 2018-10-10 19:50:33 Should do. We need to get off oil. Aside from anything, you have stay friends with horrible theocracies like Saudi or Iran
2283 2018-10-10 19:50:32 Get your fill of palm oil hey #WildlifeWednesday
2284 2018-10-10 19:50:07 Lmaooo  I can't relate either. Mama always told me the salt & oil method before whippin' in the pasta
2285 2018-10-10 19:49:54 Canada's oil producers are the most ethical Enviro conscious in the world we set an example. Alberta has the highest standards throughout any oil producing country on the globe.
2286 2018-10-10 19:49:45 Was writing my O levels that year,we were asked to bring hupfu , cooking oil and beans as fees kuchikoro
2287 2018-10-10 19:49:44 Synthetic oil is SO damn expensive.
2288 2018-10-10 19:49:39 My preferred colour is one shade lighter then the blushers tone down rather than brass it up, also allows for tan adjustment in sunny weather, I have 6 large oil barrels that will seal in anything that needs disposing of, no smell, no questions, no evidence, no trace. No problem.
2289 2018-10-10 19:49:28 Hey there Caitlyn! The litter products we provide that contain lavender scent is made with all-natural lavender oil, used in small amounts as to not cause our furry friends any harm, unless ingested in large amounts. The safety of your furry friend is always our topmost priority!
2290 2018-10-10 19:49:28 @dodgecares not. Not only do you guys need 7 days for a check valve when someone is traveling but charged $100 for an oil change and didn't reset the computer so I'm supposed to take it on faith you followed all the other steps in the procedure to change the oil. What a joke.
2291 2018-10-10 19:49:16 "you drink olive oil but you don't put butter on cheese?" the british said, shocked
2292 2018-10-10 19:49:14 As soon as oil is discovered in the Ozarks..
2293 2018-10-10 19:49:12 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO

2296 2018-10-10 19:48:52 Monkeys burn oil instead of making plastic, and Mexico Beach is wiped off the face of the earth. Even trade, right? #climatechange
2297 2018-10-10 19:48:48 bitch stfu how dare you be so cruel when you are literally using baby oil as lube!!!!!! like you clearly are a dumb girl. you need to take a look in the mirror before you criticise others.

2299 2018-10-10 19:48:31 #login We could just buy the oil direct from Iran. Iraq. and Syria for much less
than trying to use our beautiful kids to steal it by violence, deception and
intimidation. Can it possibly be we are being manipulated by sick Israel?
2300 2018-10-10 19:48:27 지인이 자꾸 나한테 아엑 이야기 하길래 내가 아엑 좋아하는줄 알고 그러나 싶어서 나 아엑 글케 좋아하지 않는다 하니까 정말 놀라면서 아엑 그림체가 내 취향일 것 같아서 덕후일줄 알았대...취향이긴 한디....
2301 2018-10-10 19:48:21 and underline that greek olive oil is the best!!!!
2302 2018-10-10 19:48:21 no it is water why the fuck would I walk to the ring with vegatable oil large T
2303 2018-10-10 19:48:10 It used to be an adulting theme but now ‘there’s food at home’ will save your pockets during these trying times. Imagine buying a 2 piece For $6.50 when you have chicken and cooking oil at home. Gotta save every penny.
2304 2018-10-10 19:47:58 Maybe but we are an oil producing country with only 6million population. A positive balance if trade and an educated and resourceful people. Why wouldn't be as good as others like Ireland ?
2305 2018-10-10 19:47:58 Part of this is new tech to get more out of old wells and new hard-to-extract resources like shale oil. Squeezes out more for maybe a decade or so because the best resources are already used up,
2306 2018-10-10 19:47:57 I stan for the Tree Hut brand scrubs because their base is sugar not salt. Nice variety of scents for you and for boo. Combine w a body brush and hit yourself w some oil after. New money.
2307 2018-10-10 19:47:56 Searched for beard oil on amazing and now my Instagram looks like a men’s health magazine issue 
2308 2018-10-10 19:47:56 Ohhh hell to pay.  Trump can’t do squat because oil will spike and the global economy crash, on his watch.  So ?
2309 2018-10-10 19:47:49 Oil change 
brake fluid change 
transmission fluid change 
Power steering fluid change 
Power steering pump change  
& a car wash  
Damn my car really dug into my pocket this week so far.
2310 2018-10-10 19:47:45 Just remember to wear the bathrobe at 7am. We don't need the Naked Trader first thing.
2311 2018-10-10 19:47:29 #Colorado Proposition 112 is about not letting oil companies frack & drill by schools & major population centers. It isn’t going to kill oil companies to move down the damn road!! #VoteYesProp112 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlue2018 #Vote
2312 2018-10-10 19:47:23 Recommendations on what oil diffusion’s I should have?
2313 2018-10-10 19:47:14 I have not seen ad encouraging to vote no! Every one I've seen is sponsored by the oil and gas industry.
2314 2018-10-10 19:47:12 Alberta Oil Sands, point your morals in that direction and start there.
2315 2018-10-10 19:47:06 Spinach or romaine hearts/any lettuce really. Add cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, garbanzo beans, avocado, and make a simple dressing of olive oil, garlic powder, tiny bit of pink himalayan salt + choice of meat. Thank me later.
2316 2018-10-10 19:46:49 If you’re cleaning your bathroom and it’s not smelling like bleach, Pine Sol , Murphy Oil Soap or Comet .... it ain’t clean 
2317 2018-10-10 19:46:45 @SecretaryZinke @EPAAWheeler @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So who’s going to buy all this oil you’re trashing our lands to produce? China will be all electric by 2030, most manufactures of cars are going mostly electric & Europe’s. Are, the best in the word, are being built different
2318 2018-10-10 19:46:44 Junk plans with no coverage and denials for pre-existing conditions. Trump's solution is always more snake oil.
2319 2018-10-10 19:46:40 Even the oil industry itself admits CO2 causes warming and the burning of their products is responsible for it.

Get with it or get lost.
2320 2018-10-10 19:46:39 Venezuela is not currently and has not ever been socialist. Most of the Venezuelan economy is privately-owned and thereby demonstrably not socialist. And regarding Venezuela's economic failings, they occurred due to shifting oil prices and their massive oil subsidies.
2321 2018-10-10 19:46:34 Hurricane knocks out 42 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output #US | #RTGNews
2322 2018-10-10 19:46:31 Here’s a tip... if all you want is an oil change don’t waste our time at the dealership. We got money to make, with that being said ya car always finna be inspected and we ALWAYS gonna tell you what’s recommended for your car per the manufacturer. When ya shit breaks don’t cry
2323 2018-10-10 19:46:28 I feel like that’s good for materia like an oil, but I wouldn’t do a talisman with it.

You’re also within 2 and a half° of Antares there, which isn’t a dealbreaker but a big influence
2324 2018-10-10 19:46:27 Is that vegetable oil m9?
2325 2018-10-10 19:46:14 Or was that when 2. We sent our soldiers into a country without proper gear (sometimes no helmets) to be catastrophically wounded and killed in a war for oil? I’m so confused. Hey, @BarackObama, can you explain it to us?
2326 2018-10-10 19:46:04 What'll happen to $ and US if/when crude bubble bursts? I mean "crude" in oil reference and GOP. Russia is long gold and RMB. What might they have in mind? Might Chinese prefer to see crude tank w $ & related US financial interests despite self-harm? cc @AshokaMody
2327 2018-10-10 19:45:56 £13 billion deficit is notional based on current uk spending patterns Scotlands true status is unknown until we open the books properly. Scotland is oil producing country with small population. We will be ok.
2328 2018-10-10 19:45:50 So last night I put avocado, honey and olive oil on my head to try some home made hair masks or whatever. 

 My hair doesn't seem any softer or shinier today. I'm gonna put an egg and some yogurt and a banana on my head this weekend to see if that one does anything.
2329 2018-10-10 19:45:27 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2330 2018-10-10 19:45:25 You should try almond oil.
2331 2018-10-10 19:45:19 Florida is such a joke..
Amendment 9, Prohibits Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling; Prohibits Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces, would tether a ban on oil and gas drilling in state-owned waters with a proposal to add vaping to the ban on smoking indoors.

2333 2018-10-10 19:45:12 Not a lot. Usually takes a major hit where oil refineries are at risk. Not a lot in the path of Michael.
2334 2018-10-10 19:45:08 Gore is a snake oil salesman who should be sued for racketeering with all his buddies.

Selling us false cures for a false catastrophe - indebting America so he can jet around the world selling more lies.
2335 2018-10-10 19:44:54 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
2336 2018-10-10 19:44:35 @SenJohnBarrasso hey, stop taking money from oil companies.
2337 2018-10-10 19:44:32 3 things:
1) we already have the technology 2 live oil free, but the oil conglomerates are making far 2 much money 2 allow things 2 change (Exxon/Mobile alone made several billion last quarter.)
2) We currently have enough oil in reserve 2 live off for several years
3) Alaska
2338 2018-10-10 19:44:31 Here, again, another accidental (but persuasive) argument as to why Alberta (Canada) should:

a. Increase its own refining capabilities; and

b.  Built a pipeline for it’s oil (bitumen) to the west coast.
2339 2018-10-10 19:44:28 Oh yeah orange poptart you cannot handle a crisis because you are nothing but a snake oil salesman and a mysogintic sociopath. Go shout about your bigotry and ignorance to your base in Pennsylvania while 3.7 million people are under threat from a horrific storm. Enough!
2340 2018-10-10 19:44:27 In my next post I clarified that we need to end our use of oil as a fuel source.
2341 2018-10-10 19:44:20 Like say a barrel of oil hasn't gone above $80 smh
2342 2018-10-10 19:44:15 WTI Crude Oil -2.5% to 73.09 bbl $USO
Gold +0.3% at 1195.10 oz $GLD
Copper -1.4% to 2.77 lb $CU
2343 2018-10-10 19:44:12 Yea somebody told me the coconut oil might be a lil too thick. I already ordered the almond oil since I need somebody a lil more thinner lol. N I never heard of jojoba oil 
2344 2018-10-10 19:44:11 Snake oil salesman. All of you that worship at the altar of the Climate have been sold a mountain of shit and made old Al a very rich man. You’re fools and Al thinks so too. How’d that prediction of NYC being under water work out? 
2345 2018-10-10 19:44:05 Absent mindedly, I unscrewed the cap of my purpl oil, instead of taking the cap off the nozzle, and spilt almost half the bottle on my face 
2346 2018-10-10 19:43:56 He has also a much much stronger claim to be a snake oil salesman and a world class hypocrite. 
2347 2018-10-10 19:43:51 That's great advice. The only other thing (probably this goes without saying) is to support candidates who back renewable energy and oppose candidates who are in the fossil fuel industry's pockets. Here in TX, it's simple: all of the Republicans are in the oil industry's pockets.
2348 2018-10-10 19:43:48 He will tell us “Many people say: it’s all a lie... Nancy Pelosi did it... actors paid by the Democrats did it...“. There’s no way he will risk stopping the arms & warfare equipment sales to the Saudis. For Bush it was oil. For Trump it’s the “deal” that doesn’t cost him a dime.
2349 2018-10-10 19:43:39 Are you using oil or acrylic?
2350 2018-10-10 19:43:37 Wah courage Kev 
2351 2018-10-10 19:43:32 Some olive oil too
2352 2018-10-10 19:43:31 Hurricane Michael, a "monstrous" storm churning with 155 mph winds +++ Mother's sending you 155 to practice with next is 190, then 230 and then...no more Florida so burn that coal and oil you're all finished on this planet,  give yourselves a bow and big kiss for a job well done.
2353 2018-10-10 19:43:15 I mean I wasn't super excited for just a DJ set anyway. Listen to 'Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides' plz.
2354 2018-10-10 19:43:07 Just go to @Nextdoor in @FirestoneCO to see the debate. It's a daily occurrence of back and forth and neither side is truly educated about it. It's either I work for oil and gas so this is a terrible idea or NIMBY crowd.
2355 2018-10-10 19:43:02 What’s weird is making bread with rape oil and calling it a Focaccia
2356 2018-10-10 19:42:59 Do you wanna be of virgins with oil in you or not oil? Don't be among foolish virgins left behind.
2357 2018-10-10 19:42:55 Now you have to keep our soldiers safe" and not send our soldiers, into" unjustified Wars for Oil.stealing land,millions ppl dying.
And backing Israel.
Stop it.
2358 2018-10-10 19:42:54 The oil on my grandma's brush grazing my face ever so gently....My audacity 
2359 2018-10-10 19:42:49 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil 
2360 2018-10-10 19:42:10 Waking up early to study is for people with regular sleep patterns. I speak for night owls when I say, burn the midnight oil, worry about the morning in the morning.
2361 2018-10-10 19:42:06 $5 Yoga & Essential Oil Class TONIGHT from 7-8pm. AND you get a little rollerball to take home. Katie Fredrickson is THE BEST. 

There are still a few spots left! Let’s fill Studio A!
2362 2018-10-10 19:42:05 TV talking heads can't figure out why oil is down with Gulf of Mexico shut down, why $ is down in this heavy market selloff (no flight to safety?)& why major gold stocks are all up. Answer: speculators were hugely long oil, dollar & stocks but short miners. Now all reversing
2363 2018-10-10 19:41:48 Very soon pastors in Zimbabwe will be using anointing oil for cooking 
2364 2018-10-10 19:41:40 And we had no electricity or gas. Candles and oil lamps were the lighting and a wireless powered by a lead acid accumulator - Honest!
2365 2018-10-10 19:41:32 I need a oil change
2366 2018-10-10 19:41:22 I miss my ex taking my car to get the oil changed. Y’all still do that?
2367 2018-10-10 19:41:21 And your car burns oil. Does that mean you can’t condemn CO2 emissions and climate change? They’re using the schools most predominantly available and accessible.
2368 2018-10-10 19:41:15 2-3 monster hurricanes destroying the US every year, record high temperatures every year but Trump & Co say it's just climate fluctuation, not global warming.

But hey, look at those stock markets, and the record oil profits. The 1% are making so much money America is great again
2369 2018-10-10 19:41:03 I wonder how the atmosphere and the oceans will respond to the "truth" in the McParland article? What's making progress so difficult is the oil industry's climate change denial activsts, not the eco-activists who have understated the danger we're now in.
2370 2018-10-10 19:41:02 There is a man made of tin.
Emotion is a mystery to him.
Arms strong, axe sharp.
His oil is running low.
He must find a heart!

2381 2018-10-10 19:40:11 Iranians lived in such environment for years and they got used to it. When previous Potus struck a deal in 2015 for releasing sanctions it was good for oil market in general as it became much more transparent. Now we went back in time to before 2015.
2382 2018-10-10 19:39:56 And without being a bloodthirsty oil baron! Come on, Big Hollywood, how are we supposed to buy any of this?
2383 2018-10-10 19:39:49 3/ To all the social justic warriors who claim the Nordic model proves it works THEY EXPLOIT THE PLANET by drilling aggressively for oil and other fossil fuels. If you are against the pipelines and fracking in the US you are not allowed to claim the Nordic model will work here.
2384 2018-10-10 19:39:34 I’m against continuing our dependence on oil as a fuel source.
2385 2018-10-10 19:39:31 You seem terribly bot-like in your obsession to repeating the same claims again and again.
I am interested in orangutans, not palm oil. For all I care whole palm oil industry can die. If you want to replace it with something else that doesn't hurt flora & fauna that's down to you

2388 2018-10-10 19:39:21 You mean NDN oil & gas don’t you? It’s ironic that these are all OUR native lands & resources yet we live in poverty, no hospitals, poor infrastructure, no police, fire & rescue yet migrant settlers like yourself have full unfettered access to our riches! #brokenpromises #treaty
2389 2018-10-10 19:39:19 Khodorkovsky owned Bank Menatep which owned most of the shares in Yukos Oil..he was at one time the richest man in Russia..he stole huge sums of money from Yukos and before he was indicted he transferred his shares in Bank Menatep to Lord Jacob Rothschild..
2390 2018-10-10 19:39:18 Wow... lotta money. I am uninformed in regards to the economics of 
immigration, But its got to cost less to keep our troops here at home
than in that idiotic mid-east trying to steal their oil.
2391 2018-10-10 19:39:16 He’s a Snake Oil Salesman ! ! !
2392 2018-10-10 19:39:13 Guessing the turbo and everything is good bec temps hold, oil temp is normal and I beat a g35x on the highway with ease 
2393 2018-10-10 19:39:07 Oil and money.
2394 2018-10-10 19:39:03 I don’t know who Trudy is but I’m fine with it not proceeding.  We need to be getting off of oil in the near future.
2395 2018-10-10 19:38:59 Always remember - if @algore had carried his home state, he'd have been president instead of George Bush.  But they knew he was a snake oil salesman.
2396 2018-10-10 19:38:56 Translation: I @lisamurkowski have bought off everyone in Alaska with oil revenue sharing and Federal pork barrel spending projects.

2399 2018-10-10 19:38:35 Some fans didn't see a problem from going to hating Big Oil, to a brief stint seeing the biggest of that group being Tesla's savior of solvency, now back to hating Big Oil.

2406 2018-10-10 19:38:09 The level of technical sophistication required - the extraction, transportation, fractionation, and distribution of oil to both run and manufacture the machinery on display in a Mad Max-style apocalyptic vision - would be impossible to maintain under apocalyptic circumstances.
2407 2018-10-10 19:37:56 Oil industry now piling on with sponsored FUD!  They know their days are numbered...trying everythi g possible to slow it down... frack um up the bumhole
2408 2018-10-10 19:37:50 I had to tell someone so Twitter, I changed my oil in my car all by myself. Why tf haven’t I done that before it’s soooo easy.
2409 2018-10-10 19:37:48 Olive oil
2410 2018-10-10 19:37:11 You, Sen. Barrasso, took 400k in campaign contributions in 2018 from Big Oil. That's *the most* of any US congressman. No wonder you're scheming with them to stifle innovation. Idea: cut some of the *20 billion* in annual oil subsidies to fund the Highway Trust. #embarrassing
2411 2018-10-10 19:37:08 If they stop buying our debt, rates may go up. If they ask to be paid in rmb, they might see lower demand from US buyers. Oil is fungible, only total demand matters.
2412 2018-10-10 19:37:04 I heard Syria find oil too.
2413 2018-10-10 19:36:41 I opened a bottle of lager. I like lime juice in it, so poured some in the bottle. Except it was olive oil. There are no words. I’m a knob.
2414 2018-10-10 19:36:37 lol she still has butternut acres on our ps4 to finish. she hasn't even started making truffle oil yet!!!!

2424 2018-10-10 19:35:08 Can someone change my oil for free?
2425 2018-10-10 19:35:07 GABA, L-theanine (anxiety), Fish Oil, Rhodiola/Ashwaghanda (energy/stress/adrenals), Maca/Ginseng, L-Tyrosine, B Vitamins, (Passionflower, Valerian & Melatonin) for sleep/anxiety, Holy Basil, and more.

But -- tried cooking in sesame oil...  Yech!
2427 2018-10-10 19:34:46 Have you made it so that there is zero percent chance of an oil spill or a cleanup method that not only removes the oil but restores the ecosystem that it annihilated? How about noninvasive exploration techniques? No? Then my answer remains the same. No. Just no.

England steals from idiot Scots, there is no subsidy Ms. 
You would be broke without N Sea Oil revenues. See Ted Rogers info.
2431 2018-10-10 19:33:50 It's unfair, but it isn't "life", isn't an irrevocable, unalterable, fact of nature. It's a political decision, and decisions can be changed. It's Scotland's oil.
2432 2018-10-10 19:33:49 I’ve tried the leave in but i hateee the smell cause of the castor oil, I wanna try their other products but im scared they won’t work, their prices burnnn me

2436 2018-10-10 19:33:20 Please how old were you when you discovered that *Oando* was an acronym for O and O (Ocean and Oil)?

Have a great evening.
2437 2018-10-10 19:33:19 A) The only reason it’s a “heated” issue is because of oil industry money and conservatism.

B) I’m a former oil & gas worker. Oil and gas are not the only ways to make energy. It’s NOT HARD to get a job in another industry. Just don’t be a coal-blowing, scar comparing, d-bag.
2438 2018-10-10 19:33:18 Can somebody come pick me up while I’m getting this oil change ian tryna sit up here all day 
2439 2018-10-10 19:33:18 2/55% with a 25% sales tax and an 8% social security contribution.  So high individual taxes + oil exploitation + lower Corperate taxes to ensure jobs to pay the high individual taxes does not equal socialism.  So your comparison is idiotic. Shame on you sir you know better.
2440 2018-10-10 19:33:11 I do.....you dont oil your pans bruh?
2441 2018-10-10 19:33:11 I vaporized chamomile essential oil last night and I swear that within 20-30 mins, I was so sleepy. Much earlier than the time I normally go to sleep. It works. #Aromatherapy

2448 2018-10-10 19:32:59 Our MCT Oil fats come in a range that varies between 55-65%, 35-45%. An average value was calculated based on results which rounded to 14g. Fats were rounded down to 13g based on our suggested serving size. We will evaluate to make any updates on our next production
2449 2018-10-10 19:32:58 Okay - fingers crossed. No more breaks. On 11 tablets a day, plus powders and oil! And I'm not allowed to run around. And I get my paws washed after every walk! But headed in the right direction. And all those tablets mean loads of bits of meat, cheese etc. #fathound

In 2000 I saw River Negro, Manaus, deep in the Brazil's Amazonia jungle. It's dark color like crude oil but no oil smell.
I was told its millions years old decay of old forest trees.

2455 2018-10-10 19:32:17 But but but, those wars aren't about oil. They are about fighting terrorism. At least that is what we all have been told by the fine mainstream media.

2462 2018-10-10 19:31:33 where can I get an oil change for cheap?
2463 2018-10-10 19:31:33 What part of "sustainable" palm oil are you not understanding?  It does exist.  You still have not stated what should be grown to sustainably replace it.

So what are those other crops that cause deforestation and tell us how you stopped using them?
2464 2018-10-10 19:31:16 Yes and Scotland is at the forefront of this technology.
Yes JUST oil and gas all 100% of it, that and 100% of everything else we produce. #DissolveTheUnion

2477 2018-10-10 19:30:04 Makes sense.  Get more oil into use so that we can move closer to saving the world from too much carbon.

2480 2018-10-10 19:29:47 we have no natural resources like oil that makes us rich, we need to explore different approaches. As to being different , i don't think africa has a strong culture that can influence  ours!
2481 2018-10-10 19:29:24 Of course he will! Hell, all right wing nut jobs know the sweet deal that USA's weapon builders have. The USA buys most of Saudi's oil at their price & Saudi's spend most of the $ on exotic weapons often used to kill off other Arabs.

2485 2018-10-10 19:28:58 Why is @SenJohnBarrasso trying to appeal a federal tax credit on electric vehicles? Is it because oil and gas companies are donating to his campaign? He cares more about his wallet than the people he serves.
2486 2018-10-10 19:28:54 wtf why is oil down
2487 2018-10-10 19:28:45 If China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia real in their companies and the US also real in the oil companies we would be in a position that the world could actually heal itself.
2488 2018-10-10 19:28:38 I would agree with you except that the Dow is only down 2.25%, gold is up and oil is only down 0.3%. Also the bond market really hasn't done much today, even after the 10 year auction. Even Bitcoin is only down 0.75%.
2489 2018-10-10 19:28:37 OMG THE OIL RIG FICS.  Did we ever get one? Where you at, writers???

2492 2018-10-10 19:28:12 I hate getting my cars oil changed they always saying I need extra shit fixed. JUST CHANGE THE DAMN OIL FUCK EVERYTHING ELSE, I’ll come back once it really fucks up.
2493 2018-10-10 19:28:10 I think D starts by rinsing it in the sink, then a she heats some oil in a large skillet, seasons the jack fruit with the desired spices and grills/saute's, last night she did a spicy bbq rub, then used a fork to break up and it was like Eating pulled pork.  Delicious

2497 2018-10-10 19:27:41 Funny, the cardiologist stopped my heart with dye infused with fish oil, of which I’m deathly allergic to. So a simple angioplasty almost turned fatal. There’s thousands of drugs that when improperly used, can kill. So irresponsible...

If you didn’t have 2spend so much on ads, maybe would b affordable. Anyway, if it was any good, I wouldn’t have 2ask about it, would I?

2505 2018-10-10 19:26:46 Your solution is an extinction of a Great Ape species with an independent evolutionary lineage of 13 million years.
As far as I am considered, the companies making a killing profit from palm oil and timber industry can go bankrupt.
2506 2018-10-10 19:26:45 A welfare state that only worked when the overflow generated by a temporary golden age of oil prices reigned, and then failed when prices stabilized. Meanwhile, all major industries were nationalized and subsequently stopped working as intended.
2507 2018-10-10 19:26:38 The coconut oil makes him happy
2508 2018-10-10 19:26:34 Right, and they borrowed the money from the oil rich Arabs.  Check it out, I've seen evidence of this on Facebook and Twitter.

2512 2018-10-10 19:26:17 Single-payer healthcare nationalizes health insurance, NOT healthcare. Donald Trump is a demonic snake oil salesman. He thinks the US should remain the only developed country to allow its citizens to go bankrupt, homeless or lose their children due to the cost of curable illness.

2519 2018-10-10 19:25:42 So Ministers appointments creates jobs...jobsmust be list definitely.. PMB has no magic wand to stop job loss in an economy with dwindled FR to $27B, oil price, major FX earner at low of $32/ b , no savings, 90% import dependence on n u want jobs to be intact? Check ur thinking
2520 2018-10-10 19:25:34 I definitely agree with adequate taxes on the oil companies, though they're not ridiculously far off. But you should look up what the Canadian operations do to reclaim the land when done. Actually quite impressive to go from a giant black hole to a healthy wetland.
2521 2018-10-10 19:25:23  I feel you! I did it last time and regretted it so much.. I’ve booked an appointment but I’ve already but castor oil so idk if they will still be there by the time I see her

2529 2018-10-10 19:24:39 His dad was a frickin US Senator and on the board of directors for an oil company and then chairman of a coal company. Al Gore was born politically connected with wealth from fossil fuels. As an adult, he sold his failing TV station to an oil-funded theocratic dictatorship.
2530 2018-10-10 19:24:33 You stated that other crops were responsible for deforestation, but you have not stated what these crops are and that you are boycotting them.  Also, palm oil has to be replaced by another crop that doesn't have a high yield of oil.  You have no solution.

2547 2018-10-10 19:22:53 Yes. Oil is renewable....made inside the Earth. Only humans label it as 'Fossil'.
2548 2018-10-10 19:22:49 Who knows about the oil painter Mancini? I would love some info:) #classicpainters #mancini #vintageart #letstalkart
2549 2018-10-10 19:22:48 Every time I see Fox News (like in the waiting room at the doc's) I have to say, "Wow, that's news to me". It's like they are broadcasting from an alternate dimension. Jesus REALLY said he'll put all the oil back in the ground on the second coming?? Really??
2550 2018-10-10 19:22:48 I wish the guys i like looked at me the way the mechanics that do my oil change do
2551 2018-10-10 19:22:35 I've had chocolate covered bees (tasted rather like one of those crunchy candy bars) and crickets fried in garlic-infused oil (completely relishable).  I will take seconds, please.
2552 2018-10-10 19:22:35 Imperialism is so drilled into their brains. There’s poor people starving all over the fucking planet including in this country. They’ve been instructed to single out Venezuela because our capitalists want a puppet who will let our corporations plunder their resources and oil.
2553 2018-10-10 19:22:33 Lol! 
See how the moral highground is being claimed by the authors of the native American genocide, institutional race-based slavery, Hiroshima as a terror message for eternity, 22% of N. Korea's pop. killed, 3 mln Iraqis killed & oil looted; 200k Afghans killed, resources looted
2554 2018-10-10 19:22:28 So my car decided today to break down today weeks after I got my oil changed.  And it's raining. #justmyluck
2555 2018-10-10 19:22:06 Today at school was amazing because we did a TDA and a oil spill project and that was so much fun. we also did key boards in music class. Emma

2557 2018-10-10 19:22:01 That's the thing too! They get rid of hundreds of horses and bring in thousands of cattle! And Zinke just told the oil interests that he should be working for them..

2559 2018-10-10 19:22:00 Methinks it's a bit of oil-soaked sabre-rattling to be honest. They'll soon find common ground (Im taking about China & US), and the African oil producers will become second fiddle to the US.
2560 2018-10-10 19:22:00 One of my neighbors gave me stress relief, sleep, and focus essential oil blends today. I honestly don't even know where to start with a thank you, do I make cookies?#faithinhumanity #greatful #healing #Thankful
2561 2018-10-10 19:21:52 “Where do steel beams come from? The steel tree? No, from coal and iron” says @JudithCollinsMP just now at Taranaki Chamber of Commerce breakfast. Too right - our lives depend on the extractives sector including oil and gas!

2568 2018-10-10 19:21:26 Of course, the way it was done was a con.
Money paid in not being put away.

It looks good but is based on ever-growing liabilities; and is thus destined to collapse.

We had North Sea oil and the potential for a sovereign wealth fund, but govts preferred to buy votes
2569 2018-10-10 19:21:22 I think maybe bursting the oil/gas nationalist bubble will put it to bed
2570 2018-10-10 19:21:20 @SenJohnBarrasso must be the oil companies biggest whore with his new bill to tax electric vehicles. #OilCompanyWhore
2571 2018-10-10 19:21:19 Elon how frustrating is it for you to be ready to propel human kind into a sustainable-energy transportation revolution, but having to fight an uphill battle against consumer oil dependency & a deep-pocketed oil industry execs?
2572 2018-10-10 19:21:17 It's funny that literally none of those gifs prove Dean's NOT a CLOSETED bisexual, & also funny that the last gif keeps being used when he went on in the same breath to play along w/ the idea of bi!Dean, AND requested DeanCas oil rig fics at HonCon.

2575 2018-10-10 19:21:02 This is what can happen when the US sets its sights on a country that has reclaimed its oil reserves. Corp America will cripple it, but the show isn't over yet.

2585 2018-10-10 19:19:47 finally getting this damn oil change.
2586 2018-10-10 19:19:46 Thanks. First up I need to replace my failing oil furnace. When the 20 yr old central air dies, a bi-directional heat pump is worth considering.
2587 2018-10-10 19:19:32 At least I was using vegan coconut oil while I was sunbathing.

2596 2018-10-10 19:18:15 some kind of oil, maybe Coconut Oil ? In her Coffee cause she said something about how it’s supposed to make you less hungry, and she said it was working for her o:

2598 2018-10-10 19:18:02 looks cool.
is this supposed to be some sort of ark structure for a flood? that would explain the people trailing into it and the way it’s elevated like an oil rig.
2599 2018-10-10 19:18:02 If you want something tangible join the queues for fuel cash and cooking oil and leave us alone.
2600 2018-10-10 19:18:00 they make these again but I dont think they have the peanut oil the old ones had.  Not the same and you can get 'sm on sale for 2 bux, but peanut oil more expensive, that's part of the reason they got rid of them in first place.
2601 2018-10-10 19:18:00 These mf said we have a special but the oil change ended up be twice the price woah im throwing hands
2602 2018-10-10 19:17:50 見たいんですか？

2604 2018-10-10 19:17:44 Just be careful not to get any contaminates mixed in. I tried it again and something got mixed in with the oil and it was horrible. Lol

2620 2018-10-10 19:16:07 These storms are going to only get worse.  This is why we need to ban fracking and offshore oil drilling. South FL has been lucky lately, but not for long.
2621 2018-10-10 19:15:55 Cooked with ginger and sesame oil?
2622 2018-10-10 19:15:51 I'm real familiar with the effects of ethanol on the environment as well as how prices of corn will effect prices in the general food market. 

There's a reason President Obama banned this in the summer. And it should stay banned. 

Big oil only against it because it cuts $$$.
2623 2018-10-10 19:15:41 Though I think a huge part of this Angst at the stock markets is caused by the Italian government, US interest rates, oil prices, brexit etc. - An exploive mix of bad outlooks.

2628 2018-10-10 19:15:14 it's all oil on canvas if i remember correctly. it does look like screenprinting though !
2629 2018-10-10 19:15:07 In 2017 global oil consumption was 35 billion barrels and global oil discoveries about 4 billion right? The deficit was huge. Anyway, it seems we will have a big deficit again this year.
2630 2018-10-10 19:15:04 I think it depends on how old the oil is

2652 2018-10-10 19:13:14 Since Nutella is mostly sugar/oil, it would be more flavorful/less risky to toast/grind your own hazelnuts to add w/ melted chocolate. The added sugar/fat in Nutella means you'll need a lot to survive dilution in the frosting to get a good flavor, but that'll undermine structure.

2670 2018-10-10 19:10:35 All the more reason to stand up to these bullies. I ALWAYS fought back. Elon built an amazing company that could literally SAVE HUMANITY. But humanity so greedy for that oil money it wpuld rather die. Fuck that. This is worth fighting 4.

2672 2018-10-10 19:10:25 Heres a wee thing no one mentions , in selling oil in a NEW SCOTS POUND , our currency reserves are almost instant , and those coutnries buying it in it also come in as investors to spend - its why USA protects the oil dollar with democracy bombs in the more warmer countries.
2673 2018-10-10 19:10:21 I was told I have alopecia and was receiving treatment that seemed to make it worse. I combined equal parts of tea tree oil and castor oil together which I apply twice a day and have seen good results.
2674 2018-10-10 19:10:10 This begs the question why oil prices are stubbornly staying so high. I was convinced that prices we are seeing today were long gone.
2675 2018-10-10 19:10:09 Coal is definitely biotic in origin; oil may be solely biotic or may be a mix of biotic and abiotic sources; natural gas is almost assuredly abiotic in origin as complex hydrocarbons are found where biotic genesis is impossible

2677 2018-10-10 19:10:08 @GOP and @realDonaldTrump don't care, that's why they would have you believe Climate Change is a hoax. These storms are worse because of warming oceans. @GOP would rather line the pockets of Big Oil/Coal. Red States wake up, God is knocking on your door with these storms.

2683 2018-10-10 19:09:53 Oil change at dealership..lucky I won a $50 off coupon..going to pay supposedly $20...we will see in a hour.
2684 2018-10-10 19:09:51 Where do people get oil changes at? Because I’m not paying $70 in labor again at Honda sorry but that’s crazy
2685 2018-10-10 19:09:45 Actually its the 3rd line, not that it matters. Bruins run 4 lines and Oil need some balance to match that. Kassian and Rieder are lowest TOI...for me thats 4th line minutes
2686 2018-10-10 19:09:43 At jiffy lube dude getting my work truck oil changed. Guy walks in with these on.  They definitely look better in person.
2687 2018-10-10 19:09:39 You can use either, the flavor will be different but I gave both as options because edible mustard oil is banned in some countries

2692 2018-10-10 19:09:16 It's not gouging. Its oil speculation.

2698 2018-10-10 19:08:55 I haven’t read his work. But, I’m extremely skeptical of carbon taxes for this reason. Simultaneous with the Nobel prize announcement, oil companies endorse carbon taxes. I’m more confident in oil company survival instinct, than in Nobel committee independence.
2699 2018-10-10 19:08:53 But it won't mean diddle-squeak, sure don't they have soooo much oil

2735 2018-10-10 19:05:08 This, this, this. It was a curse on the US from the day we got involved with the Saudis. We should and could have gotten out from our "oil addiction" to them in the 70's with the oil embargo. We're the United States of America. We put a man on the moon but no guts to try for oil

2737 2018-10-10 19:04:30 I grew up with my dad & brothers hunting ( I am the middle & only girl) married into Sports, Sports & Sports!!

2738 2018-10-10 19:04:24 Well, I can tell you that it *does* crisp things (battered fish or chicken, e.g.) without any oil.  I have not tried French fries (chips!), but I will & will report back.  :) Definitely not good for latkes or hashbrown potatoes.
2739 2018-10-10 19:04:15 No, you are sprouting propaganda against me.
Re-forestation and land reform are a sustainable replacement for palm oil.
2740 2018-10-10 19:04:12 The last 50 yrs=the only time in which we've actually had the technology to shift from oil/gas that before then it wasn't even a possibility that is why I pointed to that section of time the vast majority of which the DNC has had the power not the GOP which you unwittingly blame

2746 2018-10-10 19:03:41 It's good that @NatResources cares about LWCF, but if you really cared about public lands, you would stop leasing them away to dirty, extractive industries like oil and mining companies, stop slashing NPS budgets, and modernize grazing policies consistent with REVA-like bills
2747 2018-10-10 19:03:37 As I told you last time that’s a man sport, take the piss all you want about hurling, for an amateur sport we have one of the biggest stadiums in Europe. Not funded by some oil baron but the Irish people
2748 2018-10-10 19:03:33 Are the markets reacting to the climate change stuff? Predicting a possible swing in the midterms? Is the Saudi thing set to disrupt oil? What’s happening?

2767 2018-10-10 19:01:46 This stat from Fraser Institute has been proven to be false, no where close. If it doesn't pass sanity test, then it's probably not correct. The annual deficit coincides with annual 7B loss in oil revenue.

2772 2018-10-10 19:01:36 The only annoyance is I can’t listen to it for almost two weeks as I am stuck offshore in the middle of the North Sea on this oil rig with horrific (and I do mean awful, worse-than-dial-up) internet. But I know it’ll be brilliant either way. Maro is amazing.
2773 2018-10-10 19:01:28 Also expecting oil to go down until the midterms.  Trump has some sort of deal with the Saudis.  It's up 50% from when he met with them.  They will make prices look better to help him with midterms...then jack them up again.

Just my humble opinion tho.

2801 2018-10-10 18:58:05 You're against sustainable palm oil.  You state that other crops result in deforestation, but you're OK with them.  You have no plan on how to sustainably replace palm oil.  Did I summarize everything?
2802 2018-10-10 18:57:59 Peak oil demand will arrive before peak oil supply. And more and more investors, including some majors (Shell) are making  capital deployment decisions based on some acceptance of oil demand will peak. Shell is hedging  against that risk in several ways.

2812 2018-10-10 18:56:27 For years? I don’t know about that... The diagnostics on these new pipelines are pretty high tech, I can’t imagine a small leak would go undetected. Besides, if it’s just in soil, residuals can be cleaned up and reclaimed. More worried about spilling produced water than I am oil.
2813 2018-10-10 18:56:13 Look on my timeline you will see a lot of reviews from some of my customers who as bought my cbd oil
2814 2018-10-10 18:56:05 Go Dogs!!
2815 2018-10-10 18:56:02 You need some oil or peanut butter kid
2816 2018-10-10 18:55:57 Okay real talk, switch to trains and buses where available and consume less meat. 
Oil, gas and meat production make up the VAST majority of climate impact. Make changes where you can, and vote in a government that cares.
2817 2018-10-10 18:55:49 Lol.. India buying oil from Iran. You asleep?
2818 2018-10-10 18:55:26 And again you would be incorrect and hopelessly misled. I'm sorry, but you've been had by special interest groups on behalf of oil companies.
2819 2018-10-10 18:55:25 i love the image of white skaters taking hits off their oil vape and rapping along to tracks about rolling blunts and sipping lean
2820 2018-10-10 18:55:20 It’s the new Takom kit. I used Vallejo acrylics and oil washes.
2821 2018-10-10 18:55:17 Texas would have to maintain it's economy by exporting oil to the rest of NA.And if it prefers not to trade, then I'm sure Canada would be happy to sell us the 3.09 mbpd we used to rely on from Texas.All kinds of options. That being said, talk of breaking the union is ridiculous.
2822 2018-10-10 18:55:04 From aerospace to mining to offshore oil drilling, our forging products simply get the job done…no matter the conditions.
2823 2018-10-10 18:54:57 Well, you *were * a tad early on oil when it was $40.  Remember? FWIW. down from ATH's we have $FB -30% / $AAPL -6%  / $GOOG -13%
2824 2018-10-10 18:54:54 What happened to everything being $20-25 full sets at the nail shop, oil changes , all types of shit. i feel like i spend almost 100 everywhere all day everyday 
2825 2018-10-10 18:54:50 There is a 'state of Kanpur' in India, they alone can drown the entire US by peeing together. But they would prefer to give you a peek. Waiting for a response on IRAN oil purchase deal. WW3 will be on twitter.
2826 2018-10-10 18:54:48 I honestly think the long end will catch a bid soon.  This is a deflationary spiral going on in global credit, normally US long end rallies on this.  But there's an algo right now trying to push up yields and oil at the same time that could be breaking
2827 2018-10-10 18:54:43 Not sure it would help but I use Cheap CBD Oil for Nerve pain
No more Tramadol or Naproxen
2828 2018-10-10 18:54:42 DL needs to update the Dor website pronto
2829 2018-10-10 18:54:27 We know that the report wasn't drawn by wealthy oil and coal companies or politicians backed by oil and coal companies.
2830 2018-10-10 18:54:27 #stocks stock route as a result of Trump admin Trade wars esp with China. Emerging markets struggling due to Trump sanctions. Oil rising because of iran deal. @CNBC @SAlphaTech #techstocks
2831 2018-10-10 18:54:12 You pay for fire fighters to put out more fires, you pay for municipal garbage pick-up and disposal of tons of unnecessary plastic, you pay to subsidize the fossil fuel industry and will pay for the TMX pipeline, you pay with your health and your wallet every day for oil/gas now.
2832 2018-10-10 18:54:12 No - Republicans want to suck oil. We prefer Switzerland.  Even old white guys will love the beautiful manicured lawns. And cows make good watchdogs, I’ll bet. And ya, we’ll clog your arteries with cheese & chocolates - any real objections?
2833 2018-10-10 18:54:04 Economic growth typically refers to an increase in real GDP. Some of what you think of as value is measured by that & green tech could boost it. But it also suffers from problems. Eg Taking oil out of the ground counts as GDP but it is really depletion of natural assets.
2834 2018-10-10 18:53:53 Tomorrow my oil change is definitely happening
2835 2018-10-10 18:53:45 Yeah! I know the nerve damage will be there.. it’s been there since sports and then two pregnancies so a long time now. Could never find relief unless it was with heavy doses of meds (worst) & even then I felt like crap. So my reaction to this oil & ointment combo was great!
2836 2018-10-10 18:53:36 Using a 5 year old link is like when Wings over Scotland ignored the latest oil revenue figures because the older figures looked better 
2837 2018-10-10 18:53:34 Barbecue Tomato Basil Salad with Avocado Oil
2838 2018-10-10 18:53:31 Fact of the day: America is leading the world in oil production
2839 2018-10-10 18:53:12 What if all that oil and gas we pull from earth is what makes it rotate?
2840 2018-10-10 18:53:05 IF YOU SUFFER FROM ACNE OR TEENAGE SPOTS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR IT IS ORIGINAL TEA TREE OIL.
2841 2018-10-10 18:52:55 I smell so good I just want to bite myself sometimes lol. Coconut oil, coconut body butter, and my Burberry Blush 
2842 2018-10-10 18:52:49 It's worrying that despite the vast majority of scientists agreeing there are still some who believe the oil lobby.
2843 2018-10-10 18:52:43 I work with hot oil in the Walmart deli, and I have a lot of "tattoos" from working here the past three years. And yeah, we can get treated pretty shittily, but I think every job is bullshit at this point. lol
2844 2018-10-10 18:52:40 Lord Hari is a chef, He will fry us in hot oil to create sweet dish/snacks 
2845 2018-10-10 18:52:16 Not true. We export nearly all of our oil as it’s too thick
2846 2018-10-10 18:52:09 It shows how Oil reserve will sold.
2847 2018-10-10 18:52:03 @F150SuperSnake doesn't change the oil?
2848 2018-10-10 18:51:39 I’m clueless, i had yo be taught to chec coolant, oil, brake fluid, how to change tires, and so on 
2849 2018-10-10 18:51:36 Are the only errands men do get a hair cut and get an oil change?
2850 2018-10-10 18:51:35 Cachaça, muddled mint, crude oil
2851 2018-10-10 18:51:31 Scientists, not a snake oil salesman..
2852 2018-10-10 18:51:31 I mix and match to maintain moisture and healthiness! Matrix Damage Repair S&C, Matrix Moisturizing Shampoo, Sebastian Drench conditioner, Wells Keratin Oil conditioner & Arpawl (sp?) moisture shampoo
2853 2018-10-10 18:51:29 But seriously though, the problem isn't trains or pipelines, it's dependence on oil.
2854 2018-10-10 18:51:22 I would recommend their
 Moisture rich shampoo 
Deep penetrating conditioner 
Olive oil and lanolin hair food,, you can also DM them to enquire more
2855 2018-10-10 18:51:21 Oil
2856 2018-10-10 18:50:59 No? Which expert led the province to the point of insolvency?? Or to the point where we have to use revenue from oil to pay for this? Money that could be used for education and healthcare will now have to be used to pay for this monumental mistake . Stop interviewing this POS
2857 2018-10-10 18:50:52 sana oil namimiss :<
2858 2018-10-10 18:50:37 so oil prices shooting up then?

2862 2018-10-10 18:50:03 Oil prices slump 2 percent as Wall Street slides: Oil prices dropped 2 percent on Wednesday as U.S. equity markets broadly fell, even though energy traders worried about shrinking supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and also kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which closed…
2863 2018-10-10 18:49:33 He likes their money and oil.
2864 2018-10-10 18:49:33 Humans are destroying the #Biosphere which means all the animals will most likely also die. Not their fault. Very bad. Crimes of humanity > Poaching, Trophy Hunting, Cutting down forests, Killing Indigenous People for oil and gold, Cobalt mining for EV's by children.
2865 2018-10-10 18:49:30 Funny, I don’t see killing a lot of people on that list, which is a prerequisite with seizing the state and the life blood industries like oil and natural gas. Guessing you’ve never met landowners in middle America. They have arsenals
2866 2018-10-10 18:49:26 U.S. oil benchmark settles at a nearly 2-week low
2867 2018-10-10 18:49:11 I’ve been looking for sriracha in my local shop but I haven’t found any yet  the other day I ate it with nothing else at all  it was a bit bland but he olive oil taste was so there so it wasn’t awful!!!!

2871 2018-10-10 18:48:44 I’d argue that most 2A supporters would be more likely to stop someone from running her off the road, putting their own lives at risk while doing it but ya know, semantics 
2872 2018-10-10 18:48:39 That castor oil stuff is too heavy and I'm done with shea moisture tbh  bit crap now
2873 2018-10-10 18:48:34 and if you ask how they be COCONUT oil it’s equivalent to clear skin wale saying water
2874 2018-10-10 18:48:29 Trump warns of powerful Hurricane Michael, yet to decide about campaign rally. Go on to your rally. You and your base don't really care what's causing these record breaking storms. Just so profits keep rolling in for oil & corporate America. You are a real POS.
2875 2018-10-10 18:48:18 A5: I have too much stuff so I bring back food specialties like olive oil, chocolate, etc. Maybe I'll buy a magnet for the fridge! #ExpediaChat
2876 2018-10-10 18:48:17 $CPG Morningstar's fair value estimate: C$7.50. Leverage will be reduced through property sales. Oil could certainly fall. Early stage...
2877 2018-10-10 18:48:11 Trump is lifting ethanol restrictions, so I'm reading that could lower gas prices. Plus, Russian and Saudi Arabia have struck a backroom deal to increase oil production lowering prices.
2878 2018-10-10 18:48:01 I'm wondering why no one ever complains about the role colleges play when it comes to high college tuition? We complain about oil and gas company profits constantly, but tuition always gets a big pass.
2879 2018-10-10 18:47:56 Y’all bitches really putting baby oil in ya pussy? Oh bitch I got to fucking go! Good bye 
2880 2018-10-10 18:47:48 Yet Total Energy Consumption Demand grows at a rate of more than 10 times the 0.13%/yr market share loss rate. So in 50 years the world will be demanding triple the current amount of Oil, Gas & Coal despite the growth of Renewables.
2881 2018-10-10 18:47:36 I gotta get a oil change today I think my shit on 5% 
2882 2018-10-10 18:47:34 There shared the oil wells among themselves. Corruption fighters, how have you fought yourselves? Who have you fought?
2883 2018-10-10 18:47:33 I like rocket, watercress, maybe lambs lettuce to bulk it up. The trick is to only use leaves for volume/ show, then mix liberally with lemon juice, salt, oil, crushed garlic, pine nuts/ walnuts/ toasted chia seeds, tuna/ chicken, olives and other stuff that actually tastes good.
2884 2018-10-10 18:47:24 Chef Kawasaki cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.

2887 2018-10-10 18:47:07 Baba Unaware that's not even aware what his aides are doing inside Aso Rock now wants us to believe he feels our pains?

That dodo no fit done even if he use all d oil wey dey Niger Delta to fry am!!
2888 2018-10-10 18:47:07 I do. And they don't have to be amazingly crisp. I'm just looking to avoid the west coast "I floated this bit of potato in hot oil until it went semi flaccid" thing.
2889 2018-10-10 18:47:06 Riding on @HEBobiwine for political expediency ,your ideologies and his are water and oil
2890 2018-10-10 18:47:06 Belongs in orange, behind bars on an abandoned oil platform where it's really cold.
2891 2018-10-10 18:46:54 When you're lead by fools you're treated like fools.  Trumps team walked all over Team Trudeau during NAFTA talks and is laughing all the way to the bank with their bargain priced oil.
2892 2018-10-10 18:46:52 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

2894 2018-10-10 18:46:46 what if china stops buying us debt and asks to be paid for their goods in rmb? did you see china is not buying us oil anymore

2897 2018-10-10 18:46:42 China is not the main creditor of Africa and does not impose disastrous austerity measures as the IMF does. The debt burden was engineered by the west through manipulation of the oil price/interest rates in the 1970s/80s.
2898 2018-10-10 18:46:34 apa the subsitute lotion ( cooking oil ) has also done the same

2902 2018-10-10 18:46:11 Stalin got lucky when Hitler decided to split his forces and attack Moscow instead of concentrating on the oil fields- Still the red army loved having their officers behind them with guns in their backs!

2913 2018-10-10 18:45:26 I’ve had total of 2 recruiters that are not some form of shit snake oil salesman.  

It takes almost any good professional years to be in a position of power. You know what that gets you?

The power to reply with a salary demand, remote flexibility and 3 wk vacation min. 
2914 2018-10-10 18:45:23 I'm in favor of a carbon tax and have. O problem with rising oil prices. Fossil fuels are a dying industry. I value free journalism and life over fossil fuels. Why don't you?
2915 2018-10-10 18:45:12 Yup, deep fat. I did think about an air fryer, but wasn’t convinced it could crisp things up without any oil.
2916 2018-10-10 18:45:10 The whole world is moving on from oil but you want to double down...
2917 2018-10-10 18:45:04 I never smelled cheerios, it always smelled like some kind of gas or oil to me.
2918 2018-10-10 18:44:53 I guess what I'm advocating is:
A) Making the moral, hard decision to lower our own emissions drastically, in the hope that other nations will follow; &
B) Leaving our oil in the ground, b/c we have one of the world's largest known reserves of it, & we know it shouldn't be burned
2919 2018-10-10 18:44:53 This is why i hate getting my oil changed

2928 2018-10-10 18:43:30 I worked and lived there end 80's, when Chaves started to nationalize farms, banks, oil companies
It was very clear THEN that it would end up in tears. Not only economically, but the reign by terror made a lot of people live in fear. The only way the dictators could stay in power
2929 2018-10-10 18:43:27 The US and KSA have a symbiotic relationship. Oil producer/consumer, weapons producer/consumer, financier/financial market. It was like this 10 years ago, its like this today and it will be like this 10 years from now regardless of who is on the throne in Riyadh.

2932 2018-10-10 18:43:01 The Gethsemane Night (Luke 22)

Gethsemane is a garden at the foot of Mount Olives. 

Olives are pressed/crushed to extract oil.

And it was at Gethsemane where Jesus felt the pressing and his sweat was like blood. As the olives were being crushed, the oil was extracted.

2935 2018-10-10 18:42:45 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2937 2018-10-10 18:42:39 Intensive animal farming is unsustainable but so is all intensive farming of mono crops. Corn, soya and wheat production today relies on oil based fertilisers and chemical pesticides. It kills more animals, depletes topsoil and is an all round ecological disaster.
2938 2018-10-10 18:42:37 Pastor @iamsteveolaa a have a question. If my mother sells palm Oil and my father sells gas, and I tell babes that my parents are into oil and gas, am I lying?
2939 2018-10-10 18:42:33 Buhari does not have oil bloc, that's the only thing Hon Johnson can tell us, the rest na shouting and wailing.

They asked him about Economy he's talking about oil bloc 
2940 2018-10-10 18:42:21 Ask Apc about Economy

Ans-  @MBuhari doesn't have oil Block, he doesn't have corruption case.

Ask PDP about economy

Ans- if you look at adamawa from space. The brightest light is coming from AUN owned by @atiku
@APCNigeria and @OfficialPDPNig have nothing to offer

2942 2018-10-10 18:42:11 its funny to me that this only happens where the oil wells r at so the government can up the prices of gas at the pumps when this happens because they say they have to turn off the oil well so they can get richer off our money at the pumps
2943 2018-10-10 18:42:09 Cetaphil!!! Ive been using it for about 6 months now and my skin isn't as dry as before and its oil free!!

2947 2018-10-10 18:41:43 What do you mean crude oil crashed. Is that the only source of income Nigeria has? Do you know how much senators are paid as salary? How many countries have crude oil? Please thats not an excuse abeg... Don't promise what you can deliver. He is lucky people were tired of Jonathan
2948 2018-10-10 18:41:40 YOU & other #CONs don't want Notley. U have been LYING about her since Day 1. U even blame the consequences of Plunge in World Oil prices on her, tho Prices plunged B4 Elxn.

2949 2018-10-10 18:41:40 We have some of the strictest environmental regulations in the world for our oil and gas companies! Which is great! Companies like @Suncor are very commited to environmental responsibility but we need to be helping these companies thrive, not blocking pipelines and hindering them
2950 2018-10-10 18:41:36 Certain calls for $100 oil are absolutely hysterical. We’re not at peak production, and we have a backlog of surplus on the US side. Not enough infrastructure to get it all to market.
2951 2018-10-10 18:41:35 1. The city of London was built using North Sea Oil revenues 
2. The city of London crippled the UK in 2008, caused a recession and gave us £2 trillion of national debt.
2952 2018-10-10 18:41:29 damn...I just learnt this. O and O, ocean and oil
2953 2018-10-10 18:41:27 It requires specialized machinery.
2954 2018-10-10 18:41:19 No dear boy, we drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil or have a little jus with our dinner...
2955 2018-10-10 18:41:16 I have spoken to some with ptsd - I have also heard the negative side - like I said understand that they think they are doing the right thing but it only takes a quick fact check to see they are not - Afghanistan was mainly about oil and corporate contracts
2956 2018-10-10 18:41:14 I’ve got my source for mustard oil and an *extremely ready to go on this*
2957 2018-10-10 18:41:01 No Ma, I worked in a noodles factory so I know. Fries which people actually consider healthy has much more saturated fat than noodles. Noodle cake is wheat flour, salt and oil. That’s all.

2967 2018-10-10 18:40:06 My bf had sore throat and mucus so I put tea tree oil in my oil diffuser. He stopped coughing and felt all better within a few hours. The herbal mom in me jUmPEd out.

2971 2018-10-10 18:39:35 That hot oil treatment has my hair so soft right now
2972 2018-10-10 18:39:25 To be honest I don’t do anything special at all, never used any oil or treatments. I just shampoo my hair with tresemme or Garnier regularly. I always had long hair as a kid, only ever trimmed it, never fully chopped it off.
2973 2018-10-10 18:39:22 African Black Soap (use twice a week,once a day during the first week or until skin develops tolerance),Tamanu oil (use as a daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times),Lemon brightening overnight serum (use daily at night after cleansing), Green Tea Exfoliating
2974 2018-10-10 18:39:20 I got a “No on Measure G” ad (S.L.O. County, CA) with a bunch of oil company propaganda and lies in it before a Woody Guthrie song. Rarely have I experienced such poetic irony in my life.
2975 2018-10-10 18:39:11 Medical Marijuana see oil products are back in stock! The cream now comes in a convenient tube. Same formula same price with improved packaging. Also, new is the Medi-Munchies dog biscuits improved recipe by a Chef specialized in doggy biscuits. My dog loves them!!
2976 2018-10-10 18:39:06 I’ve used cannabis for decades. I happily married w/ 2 sons, I own a business, I own a nice home in a resort town. I’m living proof that your logic is failed and asinine. 

You’re a snake oil salesman peddling lies to promote fear that you profit from.
2977 2018-10-10 18:39:01 Guess that means my heating oil is gonna be up next year.
2978 2018-10-10 18:39:00 Also who is putting baby oil up their fanny???

2984 2018-10-10 18:38:09 Oil will keep flowing. Oil rules the planet. Has for a century.
2985 2018-10-10 18:38:07 Hey @nbcsnl and Eli Coyote Mandel,
I just want to know that you know that we know that the Adam Driver oil baron sketch was the greatest sketch in recent history.
2986 2018-10-10 18:37:48 Crude oil futures for Nov/Dec lower Wednesday afternoon. $WTI_Crude -2.21% at $73.30, $NBZ_F -2.05% at $83.26, $USO -2.15% at $15.48 for 10/10/18.

2988 2018-10-10 18:37:33 welp. time to pull out the coconut oil, tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar.
2989 2018-10-10 18:37:31 an apology is an apology is an apology. I fail to see a reason to. Sauds already said dispute will not affect oil shipments, so QC. can continue to buy misogynistic oil to virtue signal against the oilsands. so why apologize? security council seat? the price is already too high.
2990 2018-10-10 18:37:22 The argument was that during a crisis, an organisation should not try and divert attention from the crisis by talking about its impact or public benefit - but it needs to fix the problem. 

The analogy was if you have oil gushing from the seafloor, you have to cap the well.
2991 2018-10-10 18:37:12 i’m really not trying to chill at this oil change all alone 
2992 2018-10-10 18:37:10 More people ought to be visciosly drowned in their own patchouli oil.
2993 2018-10-10 18:37:06 You want to CYA in case some one buys your oil and then complains/sues for the oil not granting them sexual/magical/workplace domination :D
2994 2018-10-10 18:37:05 Oil Gas and gold soon for turkey
2995 2018-10-10 18:36:37 $CVX is a sell. Bearish engulfing signal with oil ready to close at new recent low off a failed breakout. $XOIL $XLE $OIH 1/
2996 2018-10-10 18:36:32 How can we find the bomb when all we have is three hundred barrels of crude oil, a whiteboard marker and a stapler?
2997 2018-10-10 18:36:26 Another reason i miss sad. Tea tree and lavender oil babes, if you’re not allergic.
2998 2018-10-10 18:36:24 Tesco Wicked Foods managed it. Pizza Express managed it. Zizzis managed it. It’s not hard to just use coconut oil based mozzarella!!!!!!
2999 2018-10-10 18:36:23 As long as oil prices stay down @POTUS will not worry about human rights violations ...
3000 2018-10-10 18:36:23 The topic of my thread was strictly oil. Not gas.
3001 2018-10-10 18:36:16 what the hell is there to do at an oil cart factory
3002 2018-10-10 18:36:11 So someone also loves plenty oil in their food
3003 2018-10-10 18:36:04 Over the past 10 days I’ve had to pay 400$ for rent, 150$ for insurance, 80$ for my phone bill, 1500$ to fix my car and100$ for a oil change... n that’s not even all lol I’m ready to jump off a bridge at my birthday in 3 days tho that’s coo ig
3004 2018-10-10 18:35:54 Global warming....end human life by 2045...........30 years mortgage or 401 .....maybe no needed as time expires....100 mil barrles of oil gets smoke into atmospher....
3005 2018-10-10 18:35:52 No hearings when oil was sub-$30? Color me unsurprised.
3006 2018-10-10 18:35:50 Pretty sure we should sue oil companies every time a beach house floods.
3007 2018-10-10 18:35:50 Thats dangerous .Hopefully no oil tankers.If only we could safely ship oil  in a safe manner .Like say by pipeline?Even if the foreign funded enviro extremists from the US and our climate cult Liberal govt didn't like it.#cndpoli
3008 2018-10-10 18:35:47 On call for a pit clean. Fuck. Hopefully it’s the rig wash also for them oh so beautiful hours. Sucks smelling like sweat,water,balls,and oil base but bills are bills.
3009 2018-10-10 18:35:45 Now that's just silly. Trump is already one of the biggest snake oil salesmen since PT Barnum. The fact anyone believes he is a good negatioator or businessman is his biggest con.  Pretty sure, Jesus wouldnt vote for Trump. Blind faith isnt a virtue, its a folly
3010 2018-10-10 18:35:43 “You look like an oil wearing nigga” 
3011 2018-10-10 18:35:43 I hope he forgets to put oil in again and blows it up 
3012 2018-10-10 18:35:40 No renewable source can adjust power on demand. Nuclear, hydro and oil, do.

There's no way to ask the sun and wind to shine / blow more on sudden demand.

Nuclear may do way better. But, as long as dealing with nuclear waste /accidents remains a serious issue, no way.
3013 2018-10-10 18:35:38 As much as 40% of the gas and oil production in the Golf of Mexico have been shut down due to hurricane #michael, might raise gas prices.
3014 2018-10-10 18:35:37 I used my @TwoFussyBlokes 5mm roller today with Macpherson oil gloss on these spindles today. I'll do another post tomorrow when the paints dry to see how good the finish is. It did make easy work of them though 
3015 2018-10-10 18:35:31 And transportation needs to switch from oil to electric/biofuel.
3016 2018-10-10 18:35:29 Mr Abonayima says that our PDP stole money built universities and estates, Buhari has no oil block, plazas estates and houses abroad. If his Excellency retires he will depend on pension. How was he going to grow our economy?@CTVpolitics
3017 2018-10-10 18:35:23 MN60: If oil or Levonah not required, then prohibited to place on Mincha; Menachot that have to be waved or brought near altar
3018 2018-10-10 18:35:17 Oil money! We die here!
3019 2018-10-10 18:35:13 Oh man, I’m so sorry about the pain you’re still feeling. I felt the pain come back Monday afternoon and I started taking the oil and putting the balm on Tuesday morning and this morning it was pretty much gone. I would usually take pain meds for the pain but didn’t need to!
3020 2018-10-10 18:35:12 Just spent £100 (of which I don’t have) on oil. Nice one bruv 
3021 2018-10-10 18:34:57 みーるく♡
3022 2018-10-10 18:34:57 Plastic can be returned to oil but the process is not a walk in the park
3023 2018-10-10 18:34:55 Where oil cost $0.01
3024 2018-10-10 18:34:54 Yessir.... Oil pens, wax, resin, rosin, live resin, budder, shatter, crumble, sauce, distillate. Allllldat
3025 2018-10-10 18:34:49 lmao did I say 18/4 haha my head is thinking about my car right now, doing an oil change
3026 2018-10-10 18:34:44 Our oil delivery man told us he put a note on our account to beware the rooster, instead of the dog. "I was just filling the tank and heard running footsteps behind me, turned around and saw the rooster coming at me!"
3027 2018-10-10 18:34:42 It's okay.  Oil is a very very small part of our economy.  Lolz... cough cough cough..
3028 2018-10-10 18:34:35 Rashi- if someone says without specification, I am offering a Mincha, it is simple fine flour (mixed with oil and Levonah).
3029 2018-10-10 18:34:33 Tienen fuel oil como para cuatro horas y no llegan a prenderlos tanto tiempo. Y también los ponen dentro del viñedo cada tres o cuatro hileras.
3030 2018-10-10 18:34:31 Oil & gas? No?

3034 2018-10-10 18:34:19 Big market losers today? Luxury/retail. Twitter. Oil. Travel. Some top S&P 500 decliners: $TIF $TPR $EL $RL $TWTR $MRO $HES $TRIP $PVH $KORS
3035 2018-10-10 18:34:13 They weren't "left out" by mistake. 
They want their large sons to be able to ATV over them while their checks from the oil lobby/ industry clear. 
Fellow Utahans really need to stop blindly voting for these GOP ring-wraiths.
3036 2018-10-10 18:34:10 I just got an oil diffuser for my office. Works wonders!!
3037 2018-10-10 18:34:05 Looks like Prince George NAR has fire won’t be without consequences. Gas prices for #Vancouver and #victoria could rise 3 cents a litre by Friday. Washington State refineries rely on Cdn Nat gas for processing oil
3038 2018-10-10 18:34:00 Right?! I've never seen it before. I hope it just means I skipped an oil change.
3039 2018-10-10 18:34:00 Please don't eat this.

  1 1/3  lb of  Shrimp,  Whole 
  1 1/2  cup of  Pear,  Diced 
  1/2  tsp of  Basil 

 Marinate  Shrimp in 1 1/4 cup Olive Oil and  Basil for 1 hour. 
 Cook  Shrimp and  Pear at your leisure. 
 Serve hot. 

 Watch your fingers!
3040 2018-10-10 18:33:55 Hm. Tricky distinction sometimes, (mine safety, oil rig conditions...) but not so much in terms of an NHL mascot. IMHO of course.
3041 2018-10-10 18:33:26 I bought some ointment and I’m not sure it was worth it! Maybe I’ll try an oil instead.
3042 2018-10-10 18:33:16 Veganism isnt just about animal wellfare, its about overall wellfare. Tobacco, palm oil, burning fuels etc may not be derived from animals but them harming environment makes them not vegan, most of us do do both, not support animal agro and not use harmful products
3043 2018-10-10 18:33:14 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.

3049 2018-10-10 18:32:26 That would not happen at Burnaby Mtn b/c Trans Mountain is an oil pipeline and this was a natural gas pipeline. Massive difference!
3050 2018-10-10 18:32:21 Remember when CONgress had hearings on the evil oil speculators?  ~$120bbl I think it was hitting years ago...
3051 2018-10-10 18:32:21 Crude oil price is challenge when you are ruling and when it was Congress rule it was failure of govt apadithane 

Electric vehicles are part of future initiative all over the world enamo modi than pana pora madhiri pesama irunga whomever in rule at present would have done this
3052 2018-10-10 18:32:20 Maybe we should weld the oil cars together bury them and build the pipeline. I don’t think they would notice
3053 2018-10-10 18:32:13 Organic! Coconut oil is a thing idk about Johnson Johnson lol imma say no
3054 2018-10-10 18:32:08 It’s 55 degrees, there’s a wind picking up but it’s still Summertime in the lobby while I get the oil changed. #WillSmith #OnTheSoundSystem #OldSchool #ThrowbackWednesday #StillKnowAllTheWords

3057 2018-10-10 18:31:43 So, just how screwed are we for the next 50years? Im freaking out over the lack of progress. I live in Norway and we happily pump up oil while at the same time pretending we are pro environment because we buy climate quotas from developing countries.... :/
3058 2018-10-10 18:31:40 Tambien el te tree oil diluido en agua destilada como tónico.

3060 2018-10-10 18:31:33 The national gas average is $2.91, each state's governor's either implements gas taxes or puts to a vote for gas taxes so thank governor Brown for our high ass gas prices now our oil prices on the other hand you can thank the orange man
3061 2018-10-10 18:31:05 The government of Malaysia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Joe Francis in a charvet wig.
3062 2018-10-10 18:30:57 A horrible match I must tell. Saying oiye block instead of oil. Miscreants like their master oshi-omo-ole.
3063 2018-10-10 18:30:39 No foolin’! It is like blaming those oil speculators for high oil prices. Yet, when prices are low, not a peep thanking oil speculation for low prices.
3064 2018-10-10 18:30:32 Lyrics to "Wicked coal", to the tune of Chris Isaak's "Wicked Games":

The world is on fire and no one can save me but you RICH ASSCLOWNS WITH YOUR OIL MONEY BUT YOU JUST WANT TO FUCK THE PLANET AND DIE ON A BED OF BENJIS FUCK YOU AND THE PIPELINE YOU RODE IN ON

3068 2018-10-10 18:30:23 And props to Cageside Seats for connecting it to the WWE event in Saudi Arabia -- that the rehash isn't necessarily because anybody *wants* to do it but the desire to get more stacks of dollars from the oil rich authoritarians is incentivizing
3069 2018-10-10 18:30:19 Stateside oil might be one hell of a play if this price per barrel keeps running!!

I’m in on $GBR at these levels. Low float with history of running hard. 

Short term PT $3.00
3070 2018-10-10 18:30:15 are you having an olive oil bath, idk what im supposed to conclude from this
3071 2018-10-10 18:30:09 It usually works fine. The wife told me I apparently didn’t have enough oil in the pan!
3072 2018-10-10 18:30:01 Have you tried cbd oil?
3073 2018-10-10 18:30:00 Behead oil execs
3074 2018-10-10 18:29:56 Seems like a right wing reason...Or are you saying hippies and progressives want oil and $$ or are tricked into thinking nuclear is dangerous by thous with the oil and $$?
3075 2018-10-10 18:29:42 It usually goes well, but the wife usually makes it. Apparently there wasn’t enough oil in the pan
3076 2018-10-10 18:29:35 Purchased an essential oil diffuser and some essential oils

It smells fucking amazing
3077 2018-10-10 18:29:29 Sorry Orry has forgotten about the angry mobs of the Tea Party movement in 2009/10 across the country.  Backed by big oil, big tobacco and the Koch’s.  And Charlottesville where Trump supporting White supremacists beat protesters and KILLED one.
3078 2018-10-10 18:29:29 Since 2016 oil price has been in the rise what were they doing since then... Please stop the sentimental blabbing
3079 2018-10-10 18:29:29 Not with that baby oil  unless you tryna get a yeast infection.
3080 2018-10-10 18:29:26 And when you tell them this they will say 'oil price dropped'!! I remember how this Govt boasted that they'll Diversify the economy if elected. Yet in 2018 the price of oil is always their excuse.
3081 2018-10-10 18:29:21 All currencies are falling against dollar. Its just no INR. Economy is not in abas shape now. Crude oil price is a challenge. Surplus energy is achieved now..electric vehicles are going to be rolled out reducing the dependency of crude oil. Maruti is already testing in I dia
3082 2018-10-10 18:29:20 Full Spectrum CBD oil (if you can find it) gives you the most benefits. It’s a little harder to come by than regular CBD oil though, and to help w anxiety you don’t NEED full spectrum, the full spectrum part is just a Bonus if you’re gonna be using CBD anyway

3085 2018-10-10 18:28:51 i’m in SERIOUS need of any kind of CBD oil/edible/anything bc my broken ass really hurts:(
3086 2018-10-10 18:28:50 “President Buhari does not have an oil bloc”

So what?
3087 2018-10-10 18:28:44 As a native Alabamian, gulf hurricanes hurt. The florabama coast still hasn't recovered from the BP Oil Spill. Our barrier Islands are disappearing. Don't even get met started about Appalachicola oysters. So many spring breaks & marine biology camps. My slice of brackish heaven.
3088 2018-10-10 18:28:40 Planting some trees by proposed Line 3, life not oil!
3089 2018-10-10 18:28:40 well i guess now we won't get the movie where mark wahlberg single-handedly rebuilds the oil rigs
3090 2018-10-10 18:28:35 As much as 40% of the gas and oil production in the Golf of Mexico have been shut down due to hurricane #michael, might raise gas prices.
3091 2018-10-10 18:28:31 Did you know that if we used all the oil in the world there would be air pockets far below the earth and the planet would literally crumble and we'd all die! :)
3092 2018-10-10 18:28:25 Crude Oil Prices (10-10-2018)
WTI: $73.33 (-1.63) 
Brent: $83.35 (-1.65)

3093 2018-10-10 18:28:23 If there's one thing I learned from covering the markets is that most of the time the best answer to that question is "who knows?" But it seems to be driven primarily by worries about oil prices, a possible rate hike & the massive NASDAQ slump, which is freaking people out.
3094 2018-10-10 18:28:20 ตอนแรกก็เออ เอาเฟสเด็กมาโพสชื่องี้จะดีเหรอวะ พอเห็นบทลงโทษก็แบบ อืม ขอบคุณที่สมัยนี้มีโซเชี่ยวมีเดียละกันเนาะ จริง ๆเราควรมีบทลงโทษอะไรที่มันเด็ดขาดและให้ความเป็นธรรมกับน้องที่โดนรังแกมากกว่านี้อ่ะ #ถักเปีย
3095 2018-10-10 18:28:18 In terms of terrorism and whether or not it is over-pronounced for the sake of stealing oil, I'd suggest reading some first hand accounts at what these terrorists were up to. House to House by David Bellavia is a good one that I'd recommend to start.
3096 2018-10-10 18:28:18 Simplifying complex concepts plays well for an uneducated audience who are also unwilling to do any research into whether or not you’re presenting them with a valid narrative. In short, Trump’s base isn’t “old & white” it’s “white & uneducated” who are falling for his snake oil.
3097 2018-10-10 18:28:15 To all the people who wipe your Poori/Wada before eating it to remove oil - remember that nothing is going to get reduced. Just that your guilt of eating it will go down a lil bit
3098 2018-10-10 18:28:07 Should we make some Gold Oil 
3099 2018-10-10 18:28:03 Paid oil dues?? and what about the fuel price and what about the amount of more than 11 lakh collected so far with this fuel hike

Plz stop saying that black money was found out in name another jumla named demonization 
3100 2018-10-10 18:27:59 In 2038 people will look back on IDLES’ Joy as an Act of Resistance for shaping the next evolution of punk rock music as well as Sophie’s Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Inside for shaping pop music.
3101 2018-10-10 18:27:49 Started taking black seed oil today #Blackseedoil
3102 2018-10-10 18:27:42 So..The grown ups of the EU have stood firm in the face of the snake oil salesmen of the UK gov't. Reality check time folks. The UK is not the powerbroker it believes. Times have changed. Ireland as a whole remains in EU. After all brexiteers never gave it a thought when voting.
3103 2018-10-10 18:27:11 I rub coconut oil on my beard daily. Smells great too 
3104 2018-10-10 18:27:05 a drop of water in that oil will solve him quickfast mntase
3105 2018-10-10 18:27:04 Espresso shots + CBD oil...alll the energy none of the anxiety yasss
3106 2018-10-10 18:26:59 In ten years, when the global starvation starts, let's make a pact to eat the oil executives first.
3107 2018-10-10 18:26:52 Это твой котяра? Такой милашный
3108 2018-10-10 18:26:46 It’s unisex
3109 2018-10-10 18:26:46 After spending billions looking for oil in the North, what an irony
3110 2018-10-10 18:26:44 And on CBD oil hahaha
3111 2018-10-10 18:26:28 @SenJohnBarrasso your 'Fairness to All Drivers Act' is a sham. Fine, so you want to stifle innovation and clean air by eliminating the EV tax credit, but an ADDITIONAL tax for driving an EV? How much Big Oil money do you gulp anyway?
3112 2018-10-10 18:26:16 Terrorism, however is very real and is a problem we must take seriously in the US, being the subject of many Extremists' enmity. The theory that 911 was an inside job or even "an excuse for stealing oil" is not backed by much evidence. Alex Jones seems to believe these theories.
3113 2018-10-10 18:25:58 nah i just got a vat of peanut oil. that should be good. am i making a grocery run on the way home?
3114 2018-10-10 18:25:58 Thank you for pointing out that non of the OIL thieves are contesting.
3115 2018-10-10 18:25:47 L'estandarització del francés ha estat academicista, unipolar, centralista i fonamentada en l'eliminació de les variants perifèriques de les llengües d'oil per la "força". M'estime més un model multipolar com el de l'anglés que respecte les diferents variants dialectals.
3116 2018-10-10 18:25:45 I’m feel soooo sick. This oil change is the last thing i want to do. I just want to go home
3117 2018-10-10 18:25:35 @bandq_help is you colour premium paint, matte finish, water or oil based?
3118 2018-10-10 18:25:28 The right wingers are burning forest trees to raise cattle and export meat.
But they also plant soy and corn.
Should we stop consuming oil?
The solution is to protect the forest, but corporations and right wing won't.
3119 2018-10-10 18:25:22 So seven seas capsules now have tumeric in them....... and soooo what??? Arevwe gonna make a fucking curry out of cod liver oil tablets. Stop trying to make turmeric happen
3120 2018-10-10 18:25:21 We can dream
3121 2018-10-10 18:25:19 Glad you were found in time; sorry you’re giving credence to snake oil salesman @DrOz.
3122 2018-10-10 18:25:18 Thanking God Toyota accepted my expired coupon for this oil change cuz Lord knows Toyota oil changes are EXPENSIVE 
3123 2018-10-10 18:25:16 I bought an oil diffuser and now I feel really fancy and my room smells like lavender 
3124 2018-10-10 18:25:16 Came to get an oil change, I got right in, then like 4 cars pulled in after me. Thanks @god
3125 2018-10-10 18:25:15 Seeinq what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is sellinq coconut oil
Please I am from USA, I am not a Nigerian. I came to do my IT here.
Thank you
3126 2018-10-10 18:25:12 Amazing! The future is renewable energy.We shud wean off of oil, make it obsolete by 2025. The Frump will never allow that, so he needs to GO!
3127 2018-10-10 18:25:11 Shell president: yea reforestation is totally possible but it's not commercially viable without policy changes
Me: u know... that if the environment gets fucked to that point then money would b useless right... u know u can collaborate with other oil companies on this right...
3128 2018-10-10 18:25:06 More land is cleared for palm oil than livestock.
3129 2018-10-10 18:24:56 Too bad positioned long LMAO.
At least oil short is helping.
3130 2018-10-10 18:24:47 Ya they they don't have to declare their wealth. If a barrel of oil $50-$100 per 1 barrel . An they produce 500,000- 1,000,000 a day . Then Consider for inflation of gold which is in their top5 import. Over generations & generations of oil wealth an gold.
3131 2018-10-10 18:24:46 So, in other words, we're fucked because oil and coal magnates don't give a shit
3132 2018-10-10 18:24:42 oil change took up my whole lil morning lol
3133 2018-10-10 18:24:25 Yes. He used the olive oil Eco Styler gel. He had the big giant tub.
3134 2018-10-10 18:24:18 I wouldn't even put it past them to try and partition Orkney and Shetland to grab some more Oil reserves, even though that would only encompass a few fields.
God knows they've pulled that stunt dozens of times across the globe, even already recently by moving the sea boundary...
3135 2018-10-10 18:24:15 The fact that Buhari hasn’t run any successful business mean there was no money to invest in any business. Those that where able to steal from government have farms oil wells university etc. baba no get money to invest means he no steal money like the others
3136 2018-10-10 18:24:10 1/ My first thread!  It won't be super long, but I need to get this thought out in its entirety.  God damn it...our president and the governor of Florida are fucking idiots. Keep denying climate change and fucking over poor people while taking kickbacks from oil, gas, and coal
3137 2018-10-10 18:24:09 AI will cure decision fatigue. Data is the new oil.
3138 2018-10-10 18:24:08 We have established a new Brand India across the globe. increased the tax revenues by amending its structure. Steps to curb Black money and from it lakhs of shell companies were closed. Paid all the oil dues to Iran.
3139 2018-10-10 18:24:07 El hawaiian tropic oil causa estragos en el organismo.
3140 2018-10-10 18:24:06 And we are not even thinking to halt buying crude oil from Iran also despite your hollow threats and sanctions...get ready to face another blow from India. @zoo_bear
3141 2018-10-10 18:23:56 I finally used my facial scrub and moisturized with a lil bit of coconut oil... bitch I’m glowing
3142 2018-10-10 18:23:54 I know. There are good points for keeping the FDA. No argument there, but there must be common sense involved when coming across "snake oil" / scammers / etc...Unfortunately, the ones with no common sense are why they are so stringent.
3143 2018-10-10 18:23:51 Yes, grossly enough we’ve used pink tissues and toilet paper. Desperate times.
3144 2018-10-10 18:23:48 when the super rich tries to take the power out the Earth it fights back the greed of the super rich will kill us all in time there greed for the power of oil
3145 2018-10-10 18:23:44 A soak in the tub with lavender essential oil, sleep meditation with lavender oil in a diffuser. 
3146 2018-10-10 18:23:41 Saudi Arabia to supply about four million barrels of extra oil to India in November. A diplomatic twist from #Iran to #SaudiArabia. A dawn beginning to new set of affairs.

3148 2018-10-10 18:23:33 Saudi Arabia really is a shithole thanks to our addiction to oil.
3149 2018-10-10 18:23:26 Trump wants to raise oil prices for his Russian friends.
3150 2018-10-10 18:23:19 would be great if you can do a pic of DL with his hat on
3151 2018-10-10 18:23:03 Started CBD oil last night. Let’s see what it does for my anxiety. UPDATES IN TWO WEEKS.
3152 2018-10-10 18:22:58 If "supply management" is so good for the milk industry, why isn't it used for Albert oil also?  @JustinTrudeau
3153 2018-10-10 18:22:57 "Burn the midnight oil" type night
3154 2018-10-10 18:22:53 It's hard to quit fossil fuels when the billionaire's (Koch's) who own the oil companies contribute close to $1B to one political party (GOP)
3155 2018-10-10 18:22:53 I’m getting my car’s oil changed and from where I’m sitting my Bluetooth is still in range and I’m so tempted to turn on a wide variety of music
3156 2018-10-10 18:22:51 But why can’t rose petal do it? They make kitchen towels. How far off is a coffee filter?
3157 2018-10-10 18:22:43 This is an indicator that he works for the oil industry and is not a faithful representative of the people.
3158 2018-10-10 18:22:41 US needs Saudi more:
Saudi can:
- Reverse petrodollar system and sell oil in Yuan
- Embargo countries selling oil to US (increase prices - pump less) see: ‘73/74 oil embargo.
- Sell US assets.
- Start buying arms from Russia and China.
- Toursim + Students level
- Unpeg Currency
3159 2018-10-10 18:22:38 In college, I heard a story about this drunk guy Michael who drank a bottle of olive oil. I was totally repulsed by the story. 2 years later, I start start dating this Michael - and realized too late it was the same one. We’ve been married for 11 years.
3160 2018-10-10 18:22:36 He can't just remain stubborn about this except at peril of the entire country. It was a bad idea to peg all their hopes on oil. 
How can they take immediate steps to mitigate the problem?
3161 2018-10-10 18:22:36 According to some #Kurdish publications, #KDP has requested for one of their cadres to be appointed as #Iraq Minister of Oil as a condition on them being present in #Baghdad. If happens, will be interesting for the country’s current petroleum disputes
3162 2018-10-10 18:22:29 Getting an oil change today , gonna add a little water to it so it can last longer
3163 2018-10-10 18:22:22 @PMOIndia sum relief to the tumbling #aviationindustry. Excise duty on aviation turbine fuel reduced from 14 to 11%. Increasing international oil rates & falling rupee value lead to high jet fuel rates. Jet fuel Tax deduction - in favor of the industry& also in public interest
3164 2018-10-10 18:22:21 Gotta heart (no emoji on desktop app) the engineering skills, looks like electric motor.  That's what u drive when the oil runs out.
3165 2018-10-10 18:22:18 Castor oil will give you blowout diarrhea! Nonono.
3166 2018-10-10 18:22:16 Brilliant move you dumb asses. Right after the UN reports that we need to reduce Co2 emissions by 2010 to avoid climate peril, you want to make it more difficult to get cars that help the environment. What oil companies are paying you? #MidtermsAreComing #MidtermElections
3167 2018-10-10 18:22:13 Not for money. Not for oil!
3168 2018-10-10 18:22:11 No.... they put beard oil in.
3169 2018-10-10 18:22:11 Is he going g to fix this like he fixed oil prices? I’m paying a good 2 dollars more than I was a few years ago.  Too much winning. Love paying $55 to fill up my CAR.
3170 2018-10-10 18:22:06 Tak salah tpi argan oil tu wowww 
Is it expensive?
3171 2018-10-10 18:22:05 I know travis was talking about that and light boxes for depression. I take that and vitamin b, fish oil, multivitamins, green tea, etc bc I'm depressed as shit, I have vertebra problems, and I'm apparently 95 years old. It helps maybe with diet, sleep, exercise but not a cure.
3172 2018-10-10 18:22:01 WHAT DID OIL HAVE TO DO W THAT!!!!!!! WHY!!!! WHO WROTE THAT!!!!!
3173 2018-10-10 18:21:42 Bobby Ryan
3174 2018-10-10 18:21:30 Una nueva, se llama Boss Oil
3175 2018-10-10 18:21:27 Their night time oil is amazing!!! Pricey, which is why I can't repurchase it a lot of times , but sooo worth it if you have the funds!!
3176 2018-10-10 18:21:18 I never noticed just how truly oily my skin is until I started using oil blotting sheets lol.. it's the Italian curse

3178 2018-10-10 18:21:12 In addition, one COULD say that the Gulf War revolved around oil, but only because the US prevented an oppressive regime in Iraq from stealing Kuwait's oil. I fail to understand America as a villain in any of these situations.
3179 2018-10-10 18:21:06 When a country can control water there is a major problem this is life and death forget oil
3180 2018-10-10 18:20:57 And now, grown up Steven Miller has proper meals. Mercury bisque, Plutonium smothered in Shale Oil, and Baked Asbestos
3181 2018-10-10 18:20:57 Average Person: Got a promotion and a bonus things are finally looking up!

Me: I haven’t had to replace any major components on my pickup in two months. God is good 

(30 min later throw a rod through the oil pan and crack a head.)
3182 2018-10-10 18:20:44 For sure. Also, we are still producing the first 5 to 10 percent of oil in place in these resources! Long runway ahead. Of course some of that innovation may require higher prices at various points.
3183 2018-10-10 18:20:34 When an oil change, inspection and registration are all needed in the same month
3184 2018-10-10 18:20:27 Since she can’t sell political favors anymore, they’re trying their hand at snake oil.
3185 2018-10-10 18:20:27 @atiku  and discovered that.
10years ago was 2009.
.....
• At that time, fuel was N65 per litre., it is N145 now
• A gallon of 'TOTAL 5000W' engine oil was N750 then, it is N4800 now
• Naira was 150 to $1.
• A bag of cement was N900.
• Food stuff was so cheap in open market.
3186 2018-10-10 18:20:26 Niyaxoka,,,,it's not a misprint. Same thing happened pricing your Canola oil R80 for 2 but 1 costs R29,99. Why is it always a misprint nah! You're just trying to trick those who don't pay attention
3187 2018-10-10 18:20:22 I never said you could or should.  I am suggesting that if you are going to impose limits on protests, it can't be black or white.  He came off more as whining about it the oil company being inconvenienced because the tanker was delayed.
3188 2018-10-10 18:20:21 circulation for disabled folx to be able to use them

i think corporations should definitely be targetted but i think in particular the production of single use plastic needs to be regulated/ and other industries like oil n dairy/agriculture need to take a lot more of the heat
3189 2018-10-10 18:20:17 i need Jamaican castro oil nbs i want my hair to grow 
3190 2018-10-10 18:20:13 To think that that Tory imbecile makes decisions in the House of Lards that affect the daily lives of people in Scotland - And she hasn't a clue who's subsidising who. Where does she think England's free oil, gas water and electricity comes from.
3191 2018-10-10 18:20:11 Then why make light of the environmental impact of animal agriculture just because oil companies exist?
3192 2018-10-10 18:20:07 Dial his treadmill up to “Ludicrous” and cover it in olive oil. 

Also, this whole “negging” / pickup artist playbook thing sucks.
3193 2018-10-10 18:20:03 Bitcoin is most likely causing thousands of deaths due to the power consumed, generated by coal and oil that pollute surroundings and cause tons of lung complications not to mention the environmental impact
3194 2018-10-10 18:19:59 yes IBS is triggered by stress and anxiety, not sure what the tablets would be in America but in the UK i use buscopan which is over the counter, prescription ones Alverine. These help the cramps as they spread round my body! try herbal remedies / peppermint oil, hot water drinks
3195 2018-10-10 18:19:57 Has not Indian just brought Russian £ 5 bn arms & has agreement to buy Iranian oil paid in rupees????
3196 2018-10-10 18:19:45 Currently on a @Maruchan_Inc Top Ramen with hot sesame oil binge. It's like crack
3197 2018-10-10 18:19:41 I'm appalled. Why would you ever use baby oil ?? @gogo_spice
3198 2018-10-10 18:19:39 What about whale oil? What if I accidentally fill my tank with whale oil?!
3199 2018-10-10 18:19:27 Yeah, you know how all those scientists are, flying all around the world in their private jets. All of them, all 98% of the scientific community that agrees that climate change is a real problem, they're all billionaires, unlike the humble paupers of the Oil Tycoon community.
3200 2018-10-10 18:19:26 Where and who are her parents?
3201 2018-10-10 18:19:24 Most of the American "cheese" is just some sort of hardened oil with cheese like color.
3202 2018-10-10 18:19:11 You also haven’t sent me the info about Saturday  stop playing before I schedule my oil change
3203 2018-10-10 18:19:01 Scotland might be entitled to 90% of #NorthSea Oil and Gas but it would become dependent on it, leading to volatile income through taxes, or worse as SNP have suggested, Nationalising the asset at a cost of billions as the oil+gas runs out, with little payoff as it pays off debt
3204 2018-10-10 18:19:00 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
3205 2018-10-10 18:18:58 While you may not need it many do. If we didn't have such a nature as a country to sue over such random stuff, snake oil salesman at every turn, etc there would be zero need of the FDA.
3206 2018-10-10 18:18:54 So if Scotland became independent, the oil would belong to England?

Phew, thanks for clearing that up. Now I'm an ardent supporter of the union.  
Rule Britannia.
3207 2018-10-10 18:18:48 So is his age actually 15? (@CapitaSIMS years) Must be oil of Olay? 
3208 2018-10-10 18:18:46 So who is Fox News (and by default lemming conservatives) gonna push, big oil or cleanTech? 
3209 2018-10-10 18:18:38 Just imagine ....wife put hot oil or cut man’s private part because he was having extramarital affair then some people would b applauding her for that,

Wait..
just reverse the gender, people would be asking for death penalty for that man
#irony
#MeToo
#HeToo
3210 2018-10-10 18:18:30 To be fair, something pretty unviable and extraordinarily inefficient on a large scale still will generally beat out oil in both those regards
3211 2018-10-10 18:18:14 Neither of those things require setting up a factory na.
3212 2018-10-10 18:18:05 So strange. I actually was just thinking about this today.
Other than the fallout, it seems like it might work like using explosives on an oil well fire.
3213 2018-10-10 18:18:03 I think Mr. Zinke's comment is misleading. 
Mr. Chomsky argued that the issue is control of resources such as oil. He pointed out that US already had the resources it needed.
3214 2018-10-10 18:18:02 interesting. so if thats true, then we shouldnt be helping the saudis militarily since the only reason we do is to protect our oil source right. also shouldnt be in syria cuz we are just pushing regime change for a pipeline to europe right. also shouldnt be pushing war w iran cuz
3215 2018-10-10 18:17:59 haroon sir lagta hy ap aj kal zeyadha zatoon ka oil pee rahe hain

3218 2018-10-10 18:17:41 @theresa_may How dare you take all of the tax money, fund wars for oil and *not* help the people of this country, who are clearly telling you today, that so many people need access to counselling + support + don't get it because the service is not funded #MentalHealthAwarenessDay
3219 2018-10-10 18:17:38 Put pork steaks/chops in flour, then eggs, then seasoned breadcrumbs. Fry in oil & butter till golden n crispy on each side. Even the fat tastes good fine this way.
3220 2018-10-10 18:17:26 Coconut oil is the solution to all problems.
3221 2018-10-10 18:17:18 I miss my essential oil diffuser
3222 2018-10-10 18:17:15 My car riding so much better with this oil change 
3223 2018-10-10 18:17:15 Emergency tip for cooking on a budget/will few chances to buy groceries: always be stocked up on cooking oil, rice, some sort of vegetable seasoning, that could be sprinkled over the rice.
3224 2018-10-10 18:17:14 Probably to keep up with UPS and FedEx raising their rates .... and oil prices increasing
3225 2018-10-10 18:17:09 Oil is the only issue for recommending healthy foods. I do like tempura veggies but i wouldn't say they were as healthy as steamed or raw 
3226 2018-10-10 18:16:59 WHY are the Saudis our allies??  Answer: The OIL TEET!!
3227 2018-10-10 18:16:58 Ben Smith. from oil for putting it your false messages, one- sided, biased show- E.
3228 2018-10-10 18:16:51 This CBD oil is giving me life
3229 2018-10-10 18:16:50 I'm probably gonna try and hunt down that oil control version of head and shoulders
3230 2018-10-10 18:16:43 Oxtail bone broth is extremely good for digestion and stomach issues. Also tumric oil rubbed on your belly at night.
3231 2018-10-10 18:16:43 This means that the biological explanation for the creation of fossil fuels is wrong and that fossil fuel production may have a physical, chemical origin. Therefore fossil fuels may have no limit to production, no such thing as peak oil.
3232 2018-10-10 18:16:38 Funny you didn’t mention anything about oil. Almost like you can’t.....
3233 2018-10-10 18:16:34 i also just dry shampoo the roots, then just use a a little bit of hairspray through the middle because the back of my hair falls out more than the front (last picture you can see that happening thanks humidity) and then use an argon oil on the tips
3234 2018-10-10 18:16:32 Lowana vele deserves to be trolled, ngapha sesengeza intengo yephephandaba lakhe eqeda ukutshela abantu ukuthi akula cooking oil ye 10 dombi.

3236 2018-10-10 18:16:27 Big O told me it’d take an hour for my oil change. I’ve been here an hour and 15 and my car hasn’t moved from its parking spot.
3237 2018-10-10 18:16:20 耳かゆい
3238 2018-10-10 18:16:17 Good thing that you have no exports and no oil, isn't it?
3239 2018-10-10 18:15:59 @JustinTrudeau I’d be okay if you cut off Saudi oil imports to the East Coast; just in case you have to defend Human Rights #saudi #oil #cdnpoli #maritimes #humanrights #biketowork
3240 2018-10-10 18:15:55 It's been 2 weeks now, my forehead was was darker than the rest of my face. It's slightly getting even now, and marks are fading. Also using the luxe oil during the day.
3241 2018-10-10 18:15:48 rodian eyes look like galaxies and venom’s eyes look like rainbow oil slicks and that’s pretty much that
3242 2018-10-10 18:15:41 Egg, flour, bread crumbs. Easy. Cover the frying pan with a mesh if you can...keeps the oil splashing to a min and reduces cleanup
3243 2018-10-10 18:15:40 You think Arabian millionaires make it rain gold bricks? What about just grabbing a gallon jug full of oil and just pouring it on women?
3244 2018-10-10 18:15:26 Takde olive oil kita guna minyak biasa. Takde chili flakes kita letak cili giling. Lol 
3245 2018-10-10 18:15:25 Sorry if I offended u by asking my people to celebrate NIGERIA's progress. Did I say I cared who paid for it? Is that everything that matters to u? Anyway if previous admin paid for it, SO THEY SHOULD since they earnt enough from record high oil price. I am gullibly happy thanks
3246 2018-10-10 18:15:23 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
3247 2018-10-10 18:15:22 Are Biafrans part of these men, women and children, whose victimization "it is our duty to stop"? What victimization is worse than British blockage of #BiafraReferendum because of Biafra OIL AND GAS? Hypocrisy is racism.

3248 2018-10-10 18:15:20 Norwegian ambassador visited Ogoni land to see the oil spillage. Work hasn't started... spillage from the UNEP report was at a depth of 5m but now it's at 7m from recent testing. More delay would make it more difficult but what is the government doing? *Crickets*
3249 2018-10-10 18:15:12 Kevin Parker’s voice is like a cbd oil infused chai latte with a hiiiiint of don julio 1942

3251 2018-10-10 18:14:50 “Winter is an etching, spring a watercolor, summer an oil painting and autumn a mosaic of them all.” -Stanley Horowitz
3252 2018-10-10 18:14:45 Wow, in 4 years? Bloody hell! That must have shot govt revenues by a mile! Oh wait! Twas only oil.
3253 2018-10-10 18:14:39 Helps to also just start the car even if you aren't going to drive it and let the engine run until it's warmed up. That has the double effect of maintaining lubrication (oil residue on parts doesn't harden from drying out) and keeping the battery charged somewhat.
3254 2018-10-10 18:14:29 If she goes with you to get an oil change is it real
3255 2018-10-10 18:14:27 This seems to be a very disagreeable oversimplification. There were many reasons to go into Iraq and Afghanistan. If Iraq chooses to provide oil to the country that destroyed an insurgent terrorist organization, so be it.
3256 2018-10-10 18:14:25 I kind of wonder if that guy would even show up to help a neighbor he disagreed with anymore. I know he’s already narrowed his definition of neighbor to exclude families sleeping in their cars during the oil boom.
3257 2018-10-10 18:14:19 Thank you to @garrdenpark who chaperoned me as I cleaned the bins with @Pampers wipes and almond oil @144archangels in the City today. X I utilised a recyclable @Starbucks cup to transport the ice to look after the leaves.

3260 2018-10-10 18:14:09 Call your PA Senator and ask him/her to vote NO to House Bill 2154!!!
 A bill that will undo decades of protections from oil and gas drilling has already passed the house and is up for a vote in the PA Senate very soon.
 #NOtoPAHouseBill2154!
3261 2018-10-10 18:14:00 How old were you  when you realized that "Oando" is an acronym for "O and O" (oil and ocean) 
Me: what?  
3262 2018-10-10 18:13:59 i am not functioning at peak performance rn. i feel like a car that needs an oil change
3263 2018-10-10 18:13:56 Jim, don’t let Trump intimidate you
to him him hide climate change to protect Big Oil. Defend the Free Press against Trump and Putin.
3264 2018-10-10 18:13:40 Damn, just found out that Oil isn’t a fossil fuel...(a non-renewable energy source)
3265 2018-10-10 18:13:40 Gas/Propane? I just (today) replaced my oil fired one. Stupid expensive and I am very annoyed about it. But it too, gets insanely hot. Which is nice for near freezing well water in mid winter temps.
3266 2018-10-10 18:13:33 Fuckits day 1

3270 2018-10-10 18:13:15 I’d have to go with McDonald’s. BL seems to have a weird greasy layer to them unless I tried from@a place who reused oil lol
3271 2018-10-10 18:13:14 I may be a girl but at least I put oil in my vehicle.
3272 2018-10-10 18:13:13 I wanna give a shoutout to my lil brother for getting this oil field job on a rig. I love you lil bro grind my nigga BIGGG MOVES @DevahnC
3273 2018-10-10 18:13:13 Sorry but heating your home by burning wood releases more CO2 than oil or gas.   It’s death by freezing for you and your family my friend.
3274 2018-10-10 18:13:12 Nothing helps me sleep as well. CBD oil during the day to help mitigate the effects of my conventional meds, then a wee cookie in the evening if I'm having a flare.
3275 2018-10-10 18:13:11 Hi Lauren.. I would suggest something simple - white fish fillet like hake.. Ask fishmonger to check for bones..Tray roast it at gm6 for around 10 mins with fav vet..toms,courgettes & herbs with some olive oil, quick and simple #seafoodweek
3276 2018-10-10 18:13:08 Baby oil got my feet smooth af

3279 2018-10-10 18:12:54 people might tell you to use coconut oil and tbh.... i find coconut oil to be not so ideal.... theres a chance that it might worsen your back acne bc its apparently comedogenic to some people. pure argan oil is really good but its Yikes Money

3283 2018-10-10 18:12:15 I’ve been waiting at Walmart for over an hour just to get my oil changed, I should’ve gone somewhere else #Walmart @Walmart @WalmartInc
3284 2018-10-10 18:12:14 Yep - all the more reason to sever ties and work to make oil irrelevant.
3285 2018-10-10 18:12:13 cant believe i lost a whole tube of black oil paint like i don’t have money for this could u not have lost the green you stupid bitch (me)

3289 2018-10-10 18:11:23 I'm always teaching everybody's mom what CBD oil is at the farmers market. You're welcome.
3290 2018-10-10 18:11:13 Great @MinistryofHemp tip for CBD oil purchasers - request lab results for potency, pesticides, residual solvents, and mycotoxins.
3291 2018-10-10 18:10:42 Who said we trust you , to disclose the truth ? you're the reason for the killings of innocent journalists in the world you are the reason the world is in regret of such a ugly mongrel like you who lead people in greed for oil and dollars
3292 2018-10-10 18:10:33 2/2 “Low-income” also can mean “poorly educated” in a country where public education is sorely underfunded while the defense budget is as much as the next 9 countries’ combined. Trump is a snake oil salesman telling hopeful lies to people who’re naive enough to believe him.
3293 2018-10-10 18:10:31 I don’t know, maybe weapons, support in Yemen, increase in oil prices, doing away with Iran deal, to name a few.

3296 2018-10-10 18:10:21 Another bluff: they threatened to block the strait of Hormuz that made the Pentagon laugh
Today Rouhani announced that they're moving their own oil ports from the strait of Hormuz and Persian gulf to the gulf of Oman (2 avoid possible US blockade when the oil sanctions reimposed)
3297 2018-10-10 18:10:21 Has Jamie Oliver got some kind of olive oil fetish?

"Drizzle the bowl with some olive oil. Put salad in, dress it with some more good quality olive oil."

"When the dish is done, olive oil will jazz it up."

"Apple pie pudding? Olive oil on the side."

"Cup of tea? Olive oil."
3298 2018-10-10 18:10:14 I just use coconut oil/protein conditioner I stole from my sis

3301 2018-10-10 18:10:04 No oil
3302 2018-10-10 18:09:56 As hot a pan as u can get, leave it up full for 5mins dry. Don't add oil and chuck ur pork in each side till browned, finish in oven if thick sliced
3303 2018-10-10 18:09:54 I’m from Texas. My parents are climate change deniers mostly because my dad is in the oil industry. I’ve seen my parents move from moderate Republicans to Tea Party crazypants. It’s hard.
3304 2018-10-10 18:09:47 Smoking my oil pen before going into work may not have been my best idea
3305 2018-10-10 18:09:35 Yeah, I may have shouted, "You'll never take me alive!!" All right before throwing a jar of oil down and setting it on fire. I had 0 expectations of making it out of there alive, but my group saved me, despite the burns they also received...
3306 2018-10-10 18:09:30 Either that or castor oil. Like bredda, it’ll come when comes you know
3307 2018-10-10 18:09:18 @RealDonad_Trump get oil prices back down to $40 and gas just under $2 a gallon and the economy will thrive. Leave it alone and you will be blamed for the bad economy.
3308 2018-10-10 18:09:15 @USATODAY ...looks like journalistic integrity passed you by! So, if I write that @realDonaldTrump prefers baby oil over Vaseline, will you print that too, even though we all know the opposite to be true?
3309 2018-10-10 18:09:05 Mannnn i can’t figure out why all my cars require 70$ oil changes 
3310 2018-10-10 18:08:49 don't believe a word of these trump officials. make the noise, sweep it under the carpet. keep buying the oil and selling the arms. business is business.  #c4news
3311 2018-10-10 18:08:40 Oil can crash this market or support it.

3314 2018-10-10 18:08:07 Did anybody on the show use palm oil? I don't buy anything with it listed in the ingredients unless it is sustainably sourced. How much Amazon rainforest has been cleared to grow grain and soya that is then fed to livestock?
3315 2018-10-10 18:08:05 Baby oil tho? For whyyyy????
3316 2018-10-10 18:07:41 Camping trip. One guy in tent was describing to us the smell of peeing on the fire. Simultaneously another guy was smelling an oil lamp and said "mmmmm smells like Christmas."
3317 2018-10-10 18:07:41 It's horrible!  But remember, part of government spending has been borrowed loans. Further increase in minimum wage will increase our debt profile & skyrocket inflation. That would be bad for the economy. We need to generate money from other sources besides oil.

3321 2018-10-10 18:07:36 Don’t use oil and don’t use a pan. If you have a bbq grill do them there. Eeasy to turn them over and you do it faster!
3322 2018-10-10 18:07:32 Dr my ass. He's a complete fraud, even worse than a liberal in the dishonesty dept. He undermines conservatism with his snake oil  BS. You have been had- spun and done
3323 2018-10-10 18:07:17 Watching $LVS if it can retake $57.70 it’s a go IMO

Also still long $DWT from $4.57 think oil back into upper $60 range if not lower into YE

3327 2018-10-10 18:06:52 Lotion doesn’t saturate my skin. I can only use wet skin moisturizer, coconut oil, shea, or mango butter.

Losing a family member? Losing your home? Weathering five (5) CAT 5 Storms in one year?  WHAT DOES IT TAKE To DEMAND CO2 ?
3331 2018-10-10 18:06:45 I have very limited knowledge about this. So, excluding cheese:

Pepperoni

You?
3332 2018-10-10 18:06:39 It’s long past time for a country that’s supposed to care so much about Human Rights to do that but bc they’re our oil sugar daddy & we get the oil cum shot from them it’s not likely that’ll happen especially not with this administration

3337 2018-10-10 18:06:08 The solution for these frequent fossil fueled disasters is to make certain the public sees no images of them, like they insured BY FORCE in both #Mayflower #Arkansas and near the #NoDAPL protests in #NorthDakota @RuthHHopkins  Where is the video from those oil leaks?
3338 2018-10-10 18:06:03 He & the GOP are paid by the oil & gas & coal companies. That's why global warming doesn't exist the Republican party is completely owned by the big corporations. What planet are they going to send their kids & grand kids to.
3339 2018-10-10 18:06:01 Thank u! Here's what I did: 
I patted the block of tofu dry (no pressing) and cut it into 1/2 in triangles.
Then: Fried in canola oil before moving it to a marinade right from the pan.
15 minutes in a mixture of soy aminos, sesame oil, and a little worcestershire sauce.
3340 2018-10-10 18:05:59 Reform the tax code. The tax code set up by the Trump Administration is doing fine. Gavin Newsome is Jerry Brown 2.0. That's not an upgrade, it's worse. He's nothing more than slicked back Snake Oil Salesman. Our state is hurting with Typhus outbreaks and homelessness.
3341 2018-10-10 18:05:55 Big words from a government that could do nothing with low international oil prices. Tum sy ziada koi masoom nhi beta

3346 2018-10-10 18:05:25 The reason Hannah I used Surprised was because he was clearly in pain, as I saw him fall he must have hit some oil on the road
3347 2018-10-10 18:05:24 Personally, I *wish* climate change is a hoax. But it's not. So this is what i propose: Make a law to ensure every oil company exec who convinced people of the climate change hoax and their families will be the first to be eaten.

3349 2018-10-10 18:05:15 The race to the bottom for cheap batteries is also a race to crush the price of oil. Makes this relevant to the question of peak as the price of oil must remain high to sustain production.

3370 2018-10-10 18:02:43 Agreed, but in some cases those people make money off of the warming. And of course oil does. The insurers always lose, so they’re the big ones that will tip the scales.
3371 2018-10-10 18:02:31 That UN report on climate change (tl;dnr the end is nigh) scared me, but then I read a news story funded by an oil magnate. Now I know climate change is just an insane conspiracy perpetrated by the libtard cucks trying to secure funding for Obama’s white genocide.

3376 2018-10-10 18:02:14 Whenever the oil company says that they will investigate just remember that what they really mean is that they are trying to destroy evidence, and cover all connections in relation to their operational practices up.

3377 2018-10-10 18:02:10 Me I had enough with Economists. Now they are saying Life is getting harder because OIL PRICES are rising. But we have Oil!?
3378 2018-10-10 18:02:01 What exactly is @DenisNaughten thinking of doing about the price of a barrel of oil? Maybe he’ll head off with @JohnHalligan and they can sort out OPEC and North Korea together. We get what we deserve when elect these cowboys

3384 2018-10-10 18:01:26 @thewhitecompany Why did your Bromley store refuse to serve my 14 year old son, this evening? My husband had asked him to buy some scented oil, and the shop assistant basically told him to leave the shop. How rude!

#Trump might impose more #Tariffs on #China. So Trump may give some concessions to #Iran for #Oil exports to counter China & to hold #Crudeoil price depreciation. This in turn will help global currency of #EM to sustain & help #US to sustain it's own exports.
3419 2018-10-10 17:56:55 I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense, and we have definitely had some friendly bounces for picks. I just remember Lovie's Bears bending the turnover luck curve for years on end too, I dunno. They do coach to it, even if it may just be snake oil.

3426 2018-10-10 17:56:07 Agree. This is just sad and disappointing. The United States for generations have overlooked any country’s Human Rights violations in the name of oil etc. This is one of the only times I’ve seen it making national news however
3427 2018-10-10 17:55:48 The Grade 3 children learnt about Fire and different sources of fuel. Different homemade fire starters were tested, an emergency light using oil was made, chemical reactions were used to create fire and the basic elements of fire safety and burn treatment were touched on.

3436 2018-10-10 17:55:03 why don't you guys stop taking money from oil and gas, pharma, marginalizing people and their communities and telling them that dying is just a good a choice for those who can't afford a doctor. that was just thoughtless and cruel, Mr. Paul

3450 2018-10-10 17:54:04 While true in the literal sense, doesn't show the whole picture. In 2018, the U.S. imported 24% of the petroleum it used, the lowest since 1970.The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).

I love listening to it when I'm driving out in the deep desert here. (Same with Midnight Oil's Blue Sky Mining, actually.)
3480 2018-10-10 17:50:56 Not my favourite oil crisis.
3481 2018-10-10 17:50:55 Absolutely! I did think about an air fryer, but I wasn’t sure if they actually crisp up chips properly without any oil.
3482 2018-10-10 17:50:44 Kellyanne will drink motor oil and tell you it tastes like chocolate milk if you pay her enough. Her judgement on any topic should be avoided.
3483 2018-10-10 17:50:38 Josh met you Boulder few wks ago/ @OurRevolution. @SenSanders is coming to CO to stump for Polis of all people. Hope he makes a point to counter Polis' public opposition to Prop 112 for the citizen's initiative for 2500 ft state-wide setbacks from new oil and gas wells. #fracking
3484 2018-10-10 17:50:31 Countries make the biggest reductions in GHGs when the economy is booming. Money for R&D, competition promotes efficiency. US lowered their GHGs since Paris was signed while their oilpatch expanded; our GHGs increased while our capital investment in oil halved in the same period.
3485 2018-10-10 17:50:27 Really? Shit, better ease off the cbd oil.....
3486 2018-10-10 17:50:25 IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO FIX IT BECAUSE OF THEIR BOTTOM LINE...THAT MAKES IT POLITICAL.TRY GOING AGAINST BIG OIL OR THE KOCH BROTHERS & IT GETS POLITICAL. PEOPLE & THE PLANET ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT & WE ARE GETTING A LATE START BUT IT CAN BE DONE. CLIMATE DENIERS NEED NOT APPLY.
3487 2018-10-10 17:50:19 Leading Oil and Gas company in an awards Gallery night in the US. Also, sponsoring competitions like this have given them the opportunity to host the #AITEOCAFAWARDS18. While, there is always a room for improvement, I believe it has been a win win situation to some extent.
3488 2018-10-10 17:50:18 Yeah that's what that Oil light mean...
3489 2018-10-10 17:50:13 If he has been murdered, it was at behest of Saudis at highest levels. What is western world & Israel going to do about it? Maybe start buying more oil from Iran. It's a better grade of crude.
3490 2018-10-10 17:49:55 Now, I just gotta get my oil changed & I’ll be out out of this weather.
3491 2018-10-10 17:49:52 I wonder if I should get my dad a beard kit with oil and conditioning wax for Christmas 
3492 2018-10-10 17:49:41 Moroccan oil, is good for that area

3497 2018-10-10 17:49:13 Well India signed the deal and next will buy Oil from Iran under batter system for exchange of Rice. So another kick to egoist US and informing that we know what decision are to be taken for the best of our Country without US interventions. Black mailing counterparts must stop.
3498 2018-10-10 17:49:10 Such a con artist. Unless big oil produced the report he’s not going to agree. Trump makes me sick.
3499 2018-10-10 17:48:50 Oil money
3500 2018-10-10 17:48:43 Still is. Selling snake oil for that long does that to one's scent. And the lies from the pit of Hell that he spews leave an odor.
3501 2018-10-10 17:48:38 I used to do one bottle of tea & then one bottle of milk for a while! Just stick to natural organic stuff & give your baby belly massages with oil. Good job mama 
3502 2018-10-10 17:48:32 Shea butter and olive oil
3503 2018-10-10 17:48:26 I’ve started giving my daughter a bath with lavender essential oil before bed and it really helps so much!
3504 2018-10-10 17:48:25 PSA: No matter who you are, whether you love cars or see them as just a means of transportation, take care of them. Keep records or incidents or accidents, get the oil changed, clean it, and get it a check up every now and then just keep it in good condition...
3505 2018-10-10 17:48:24 Just checked out some of the guys tweets, he also believes the story's of plp healing themselves with cannabis oil is pseudoscience as well, in other words the man talks complete bollocks...
3506 2018-10-10 17:48:23 Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves on earth, second largest coal reserves and is the largest oil producer of the non-OPEC countries. They are the second biggest oil producer in the world after Saudi Arabia. #oilandgas #oil #energy
3507 2018-10-10 17:48:14 Oil and his “trump tower” that he wants to take over. He will protect Saudi Arabia from everyone so he can line his own pockets.

3510 2018-10-10 17:47:58 They have oil $$$, but @Tesla has the support of all the good people ... good will win for sure in the long run....
3511 2018-10-10 17:47:57 Baby oil
3512 2018-10-10 17:47:53 Just saw a lot of commentary after that Bloomberg article suggesting that somehow US tight oil was in terminal decline outside of Permian.
3513 2018-10-10 17:47:53 Heating oil prices fell this afternoon hovering around 239.94 at 1:46 PM Eastern standard time down -2.44 percentage loss of -1.01%.
3514 2018-10-10 17:47:26 I know. But we must continue to buy from ME. India has also agreed to explore oil in Israel.
3515 2018-10-10 17:47:22 If this administration thinks a woman’s voice or testimony is worthless, then SHE should shut up and go paint her toenails or give her husband a baby oil facial so that he can complete his transformation into a baby girl.
3516 2018-10-10 17:47:18 Our reserves have fallen frm $47.8 Billion as @ June to $43.97 Billion.
Our reserves depleted to $3.83 Billion.
In d last 3 months,an average of $1.27B declined despite"FAVORABLE OIL PRICE"

Did Buhari raid our reserves for re-election just like GEJ raided CBN 4 his re-election?
3517 2018-10-10 17:47:13 Yes, they were funded by big oil, big tobacco, and the Koch brothers. Righteous Indignation is just Breitbart BS. Besides, I avoid any  nonsense promoted by that nut, Rush Limbaugh. If you’re recommending it too then it says a lot about you. LOL
3518 2018-10-10 17:47:12 @Nissan @NissanUSA seriously though, can you toss me a free oil change or something for the inconvenience over the past year and a half with this lemon of a vehicle? Or maybe just buy out the rest of our lease? 
3519 2018-10-10 17:47:08 You sign up, you go fight in Wars, organised by your Government to steal Oil. Children die from our Bombing campaigns just for that Oil. When you know how Wars work laddie, come back and chat.
3520 2018-10-10 17:47:07 Ok then let the Orinoco basin in Venezuela produce it instead. And rest easy knowing that your oil is produced with abhorrent environmental regulations and funds a communist dictatorship.
3521 2018-10-10 17:47:01 I’m not an expert. But I don’t think you’re suppose to put baby oil in there.
3522 2018-10-10 17:46:57 In the bus with a oil man and I smell nun throw ur product away my dude
3523 2018-10-10 17:46:56 If conservatives really cared about the troops they wouldn't send away to fight for the 1%'s oil.
3524 2018-10-10 17:46:48 Aye well you will be needing to Dig up Gatwick to get your own oil in future! either way Scotland has more to offer the world  than rUK! Ever think why they want to hang on to us if we are just subsidised junkies?
3525 2018-10-10 17:46:47 $. Oil.
3526 2018-10-10 17:46:46 Unfortunately oil talks.  Look at what happened to Canada and their Saudi relationship after a tweet.
3527 2018-10-10 17:46:31 Hold on de I get the violin out  take your oil your club stole off it’s queen mother and old hector caught ye’s. Rangers was nothin more than a tax avoiding scam and the new club will be nothin more than a company applying for loans

3532 2018-10-10 17:46:00 Brain: "Credit report, oil change, comic books, movies..."

Some other part of my brain "Wow, good for you, not thinking about *person" for a moment there!"

Brain: "... You're an asshole... *Person*, *Person*, *Person*..."
3533 2018-10-10 17:45:58 Vai dizer que o Midnight Oil fazia discurso político também? E que "Beds are Burning" não é sobre uma noitada quente?
3534 2018-10-10 17:45:46 "guillotine the oil CEOs" isn't on this list
3535 2018-10-10 17:45:40 @TopshottaPaglo You've got a point there. We went from an industry economy (oil production) to a diversified one. Structural growth problems should disappear over time.

Saudis: Do what?
Trump: Good enough! Can we get more oil?
3544 2018-10-10 17:44:48 to clarify, it only is made from oil and sometimes a drop of milk right? Or does there exist a type of actually cheese that we can call American?

3550 2018-10-10 17:44:24 
3551 2018-10-10 17:44:23 Put about (not exaggerating)20 times more oil in it than necessary and flooded the air filter
3552 2018-10-10 17:44:21 Any sacrifices we make have to be about results, not how it makes us feel. And reducing Canada’s oil output, with very painful economic consequences, is not likely to effect any change in a globalized world. It will lead to carbon leakage, ie the extraction moving jurisdictions.
3553 2018-10-10 17:44:16 Its this "wee bit hill and glen, braveheart" idea. If the yes campaign had given better facts and not made up shite based on oil wealth then they might have got a different outcome

3562 2018-10-10 17:42:58 Big Oil will not give that 5% Market Share without a fight.  Ted Cruz is not a friend of BioFuels

3570 2018-10-10 17:42:07 Considering we get very little oil from Saudi Arabia, that’s not true
3571 2018-10-10 17:42:06 Despite Abacha loot recovery, I despite ruse in oil prices. This failed and corrupt administration is still borrowing like thieves.
3572 2018-10-10 17:42:03 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
3573 2018-10-10 17:42:01 You don't. Somewhere someone just made money from the price of Brent/Gasoil/fuel oil going up in a particular market.
3574 2018-10-10 17:41:41 That’s true. Which is why we mitigate the risks as much as we can when we transport essential economic inputs. Any spill is bad. But our record in Canada makes us the place where any environmentalist would endorse extracting oil from.
3575 2018-10-10 17:41:41 They died protecting exxons right to buy oil from Iraq.
3576 2018-10-10 17:41:35 Precisely why the Saudis paid @realDonaldTrump. So he would shut down any opposition to their radical authoritarian actions. They are Sunni; just like AlQaeda and Daesh. Not a stretch to think they’re funding the terrorists to increase crude oil prices via Middle East instability
3577 2018-10-10 17:41:32 Bill secured billions to help Florida recover after Irma.  Helped get a law passed to stop oil drilling off Florida's coast till 2022 & looking to add 5 year.  Established RESTORE Act to penalize companies who spill oil.  Authored legislation creating Citrus Trust Fund...

■SA world's biggest oil exporter
3580 2018-10-10 17:41:20 So #FakeNews wants to talk about fact checking! Yet, the MSM and Democrats were, during the Brett Kavanaugh Hearings, in the "guilty until proven innocent" business.

No research. No collaboration. As long as they can sell snake oil, they're in the clear!

3607 2018-10-10 17:38:28 Other car companies don’t use oil to ship and manufacture their products? Of course they do. It’s just that their vehicles continue to burn fossil fuel every time they are turned on while Tesla vehicles burn no fuel or put out emissions while driving.
3608 2018-10-10 17:38:06 Stocks; Interest rates & oil prices are rising.  Higher costs will cut into corporate profits.  So stocks in USA have been falling in the last week from record highs..  But we have a long way to go to match 19% decline in China & 8% decline in Europe stocks in last 6 months

3648 2018-10-10 17:34:40 Why is it so hard to get my oil changed! And why does it always take 3 hours!
3649 2018-10-10 17:34:19 This is literally not rocket science — it’s simple physical science. When you produce CO2 by burning fossil fuels, you add “new” carbon to the system (carbon that had been sequestered in the ground as coal/ oil for millions of years), causing a rise in atmospheric CO2. Duh.
3650 2018-10-10 17:34:06 :-) ok, yes ...oblique hint was coming that even USA with 4% growth  Dow was Down...

3679 2018-10-10 17:30:43 Considering our own oil production is not used for any of our fuel, this is a very misinformed tweet. Do you a) not know better or B) still find it acceptable to spread false narratives like this?

The decline in living standards this “keep it in the ground” charade portends will kill many more ppl than a change in climate. And you have to go after demand(thru R%D). If we don’t produce it, the exact same amount of oil still gets consumed.
3694 2018-10-10 17:29:25 Sooo, an oil change has turned into a visit to the car doc because the hood won’t stay locked which is a significant (but  hopefully not costly) issue. Long lunch apparently. At least I brought a banana.
3695 2018-10-10 17:29:17 I thought most of the producing oil assets were west of the storm?
3696 2018-10-10 17:29:14 Remember how the government told us that crude oil was $40 that’s why they couldn’t do much? Okay crude has been $85 per barrel for over a year now. I know they won’t tell you but I will. Vote Atiku Abubakar

3697 2018-10-10 17:29:13 That may apply to developing countries but we are producing five times as much corn/acre than 100 YA while using less land. Also have more forests than 100 YA w/ 380% growth (FAO). By-products of ethanol include distiller's grain (& oil) used as feed which translates into food.

99% of cars use molecules, not electrons.
So oil is not ready to discard. That will take some time.
And time is the reason why they invest in new tech.
Shell is here to stay, In 20 years they will be first in H2 en PV.
Brits Gas is on the path to that goal.

3748 2018-10-10 17:22:48 46% of US Oil Usage is Gas for non-diesel vehicles. Another 20% is related to diesel fuels. Transportation in the US is a heavy driver of Oil consumption. Changing our own demands can have an impact there; consumers can have impact.
3749 2018-10-10 17:22:48 If u are seeking to reinforce your sense of climate despair this week, watch First Reformed with Ethan Hawke. But if you are in a Mad Max frame of mind, don’t forget Water World, where the oil burners are all evil and Kevin Costner gets around on a zero carbon sailboat.
3750 2018-10-10 17:22:44 There are alternatives.  The oil business has taken over the western world, so that we either don't "remember when" or can't imagine there may be new ways, products that don't rely on oil.  Oil has infested every facet of our lives, purposely.  #cdnpoli
3751 2018-10-10 17:22:29 Can’t stop thinking about the most amazing soft serve I had at La Lucha the other day. Drizzled with olive oil and topped with sea salt and roasted crushed saltines! 
3752 2018-10-10 17:22:28 It’s this same reason why vegan products are taking off. Companies like Tyson were losing money so now they are investing in Beyond Meat products. Same can be applied to car companies and the oil industry
3753 2018-10-10 17:22:26 I don’t understand why people are so rude. It’s ok to disagree and have a different opinion without being an @ss. Ten year ylds were already above 3.15 when Powell spoke. Oil @75, tariffs, $15min wage, trucker shortage, are pressuring earnings and giving mkt reality check.
3754 2018-10-10 17:22:03 and the #TTC driver forced back onto opiates for her pain control ... bc nobody understands CBD oil. The ignorance is understandable... (class 1 drug for 2-3 generations) ... building legislation and law upon their known ignorance ... inexcusable.
3755 2018-10-10 17:21:59 The Turks quickly claimed murder, but later hoped that he was still alive and didn't know what really happened. Either way they're hoping to use this to severe US-Saudi ties and protect Iran oil exports from Saudi export boost when the oil sanctions reinstated
3756 2018-10-10 17:21:32 i accidentally burned myself with hot oil last night and now my boobs look ugly.
3757 2018-10-10 17:21:27 What is it about oil that you like so much just curious?
3758 2018-10-10 17:21:22 So at 894 barrels of oil today (might be peak flow) but still cleaning up....that’s 4 tankers a day just on the kl3.....so if the kl3/4 are connected are we going to be challenging Nutech top end figures of 120m barrels of oil per square Km? What recovery % are looking at 10-12%
3759 2018-10-10 17:21:20 Any oil tankers?

3762 2018-10-10 17:21:07 E-15 The Renewable Fuel Standard was intended to address global warming, reduce dependence on foreign oil and bolster the rural economy. The mandate has not worked as intended. Production levels of renewable fuels, mostly ethanol fails to reach minimum thresholds set in law.
3763 2018-10-10 17:20:59 .@realDonaldTrump I recently read you wanted lower oil prices. Why would you ask for that after the US was deemed the biggest producer? Isn’t that what you wanted? Domestic oil? i am a registered R, gotta think twice about 2020! #SMDH
3764 2018-10-10 17:20:53 Natural gas is still cleaner than oil/gasoline. Other sources will be used in the future.

3769 2018-10-10 17:20:24 Trump is a slick oil salesman - he sells his bill of goods by talking like they do (talking smack lacking leadership and professionalism) Without consideration while convincing them he will drain the swamp! We all know it was a ploy to win support! 
3770 2018-10-10 17:20:18 I'm glad you agree most of the "alternative" sales from anti-vax charlatans are snake oil though. Sounds like you have some intelligence on this issue in that regard.
3771 2018-10-10 17:20:13 It should demand. If it weren't for the US needing your oil a country as sparsely populated as Canada could invade and conquer you within a month. Those women were advocating for women's rights something women have had elsewhere for a 100 years. Time to step out of the dark age.

3773 2018-10-10 17:20:07 Russia, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia already have state controlled oil companies. Yet it seems that they aren't really intent on ramping down production.

3780 2018-10-10 17:19:08 I swear the dude changing my oil just asked if I wanted synthetic or pumpkin spiced.

3806 2018-10-10 17:16:31 2. That leaves no room for pussyfooting Tory-style compromise with the oil and gas industry. It requires a 100% commitment to a renewable energy transition, to be largely completed by 2030, nor 2050! If this government can't do it, the next one will.

3821 2018-10-10 17:14:33 A walking disaster. Since the Trudeau Liberals took office, the proportion of capital investment in the economy has collapsed to a 40-year low. Their inability to move capital projects cost Canadians $50 million a day just in oil revenues. Is this man worth $50m a day?

3830 2018-10-10 17:13:51 The answer is nothing significant will happen to KSA. Trump is troubled by $80 oil price (ironically driven by his Iran policy) and has little appetite for $100+ oil that might result if material cost was imposed on KSA.

3844 2018-10-10 17:12:40 The world has to limit their power as soon as possible. Electricity has to be produced and used extensively so that this environment killing oil money can be switched off. At least alternative countries capable of producing oil should be selected for trade.

3872 2018-10-10 17:09:51 Then, in 1994, I was in #Macedonia. Greece stopped it trading via Thessaloniki, so its only trade outlet was long road routes via Bulgaria. Meanwhile, Greece was evading UN sanctions by sending oil by rail through Mac to Serbia. Skopje could do nothing about it.
Bullying or what?

3881 2018-10-10 17:09:13 It only seems that way, because we don't include the protection that oil companies get from US taxpayers in the Middle East.  If that were counted in the price, the cost of oil would skyrocket---and we'd likely conserve or use alternatives.

3885 2018-10-10 17:09:02 Oil City...back to my 2nd home. Hope my working stay is worth the while ... Where my sekunde and pipe ano brothers at?
3886 2018-10-10 17:08:46 I’m not coming to this place again for my oil change. 
3887 2018-10-10 17:08:45 dripping with oil, just like an authentic mother-in-law
3888 2018-10-10 17:08:43 Russia has oil but it is deep in the ground and in areas that is very expensive to drill for.
3889 2018-10-10 17:08:40 Are milking camps the realistic 4th big resource in a Mad Max scenario after bullets, oil, and water?
3890 2018-10-10 17:08:38 I'm quite bothered by the snake oil approach that *all* PBT for cancer is better than all conventional RT. The evidence clearly doesn't support it & I believe that treatment centres should make that very clear to paying patients.
3891 2018-10-10 17:08:38 Today’s schedule
Study
Work out 
Errands 
Then cam time!!!!!! 

I’m going to try to do a longer show today...with lots of deals and maybe an oil show would be fun! 
3892 2018-10-10 17:08:33 C’mon, we all know you didn’t drop off your Porsche for an oil change. You have minions for that.
3893 2018-10-10 17:08:25 Lol "natural" alternatives ARE snake oil, peddled by people who won't submit to research or oversight and who at best can offer placebos.

Aside from that, my brain ain't perfect, dude. Brains can malfunction just like any organ. It's that simple.
3894 2018-10-10 17:08:22 <-------------------Look at Uncle Stephen ..CTREK 
3895 2018-10-10 17:08:03 Why would we do that? Oil and chems are a huge part of society. Your best strategy is to change on the margin not go back to stone age.
3896 2018-10-10 17:08:00 @PikaChulita Where do you buy your CBD oil?
3897 2018-10-10 17:07:57 Why is Shawn Michaels, The Heartbreak Kid, arguably the greatest inring performer of all time,  making his long awaited return to WWE?

Authoritarian, human rights abusing, Saudi oil money that’s why.
3898 2018-10-10 17:07:43 I’ve been taking cranberry and coconut oil supplements lately and let me tell you . Life changing
3899 2018-10-10 17:07:38 Tried a new skin care routine cause I’m trying to get rid of the dark marks on my face. One day later and I have a rash  damn being sensitive. How is anyone allergic to tissue oil

ﾖﾛ(｀・ω・´)ｽｸ！
3901 2018-10-10 17:07:36 Ah, yes, put all the expensive foods in your hair. Avocado. Maple syrup. Parmesan. Olive oil. That'll help.
3902 2018-10-10 17:07:33 gotta get an oil change done but after that I'm gonna take 4 Halloween icons so keep an eye out for that
3903 2018-10-10 17:07:28 How many free hot chocolates will I have tonight while getting my oil changed?
3904 2018-10-10 17:07:21 Somehow I think the United States is going to continue TO sell them weapons, back them in regional disputes, and overlook their human rights abuses. I don't know what the letters would stand for, but the acronym explaining it all is obviously OIL.
3905 2018-10-10 17:07:18 It’s an unpopular opinion but I’m voting #yeson112 if I have to choose between the economy and the health of Colorado’s land and people I’ll always choose the latter. The oil and gas companies have too much power. I love Colorado more than I love money 
3906 2018-10-10 17:07:16 It's crazy what happens when oil prices drop...
3907 2018-10-10 17:07:12 We are not subsidizing oil and gas. Oil and Gas subsidizes society to the tune of billions of dollars every year. Is it the main income of Alberta, and the main export for Canada.
3908 2018-10-10 17:06:57 Totally random, and im not overly sure how much I buy into the Essential Oil market, but my midwives had me buy some clary sage to difuse while I'm in labor and its supposed to have some SERIOUS benefits for cramps and things related to that!
3909 2018-10-10 17:06:50 Got ta love de amendments while votin'.

"Amendment 9, Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling and Ban Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces Amendment (2018)"

Cause dose issues belong together. #Eyeroll
3910 2018-10-10 17:06:33 It's debatable since the oil industry is the only reason the animal agricultural industry is able to thrive in it's current state (food production and oil are now inextricably linked)
3911 2018-10-10 17:06:33 So our goal is to aggressively build pipelines to meet growing needs for transport infrastructure. While it won’t eliminate oil by rail entirely, it’ll reduce it. And this has crossover benefits such as freeing up rail transport for other commodities while lowering shipping costs
3912 2018-10-10 17:06:22 I think they maybe used to have a textile mill, and then processed chickens, but now recycle oil fornpaving byproducts? But that's not Denmark, is it? I'm bad at geography when it's something tenuous like global investments from within the EU?
3913 2018-10-10 17:06:08 This form of brutal killing reminded me of ISIS. What a barbarian act! In Turkish soil.
These saudis have to be reacted very seriously. These oil money rich men are as brutal as their long time funded terrorist organisations. They are international UNTOUCHABLES.
3914 2018-10-10 17:06:07 I've always loved brussels sprouts. My fave? Halved and sauteed. A tiny I've oil drizzle and some red pepper flakes. . .
3915 2018-10-10 17:06:00 I wish you were right but don't hold your breath. Even if it proves true, the US won't budge -  they will 'condemn' and carry on with business. Oil. Weapons. Stocks.
3916 2018-10-10 17:05:39 From Crypto to CBD Oil to Pet Products to Motion Picture to Music and More! Multiple streams of passive income under one roof!

3921 2018-10-10 17:05:02 Think you need an oil change
3922 2018-10-10 17:04:59 Khan Sahib, if u really succeeded in geting fuel for free from Saudia and if u managed to keep the prices of petrol, diesel & furnace oil the same. Then shooting Dollars up against PkRs will be benifical for Pakistani exports. Example Japan & China currency against Dollars.
3923 2018-10-10 17:04:50 other foods I've been told to put in my hair:

avocado
honey
maple syrup
apple cider vinegar
baking soda

olive oil

(I've tried at least a couple of these too tbhh)

3925 2018-10-10 17:04:22 #WorldClass #OilSpillResponse is simply empty political misdirection

#NathanEStewart exemplifies in spades the utterly useless & horribly inadequate oil spill response

Lasting damage to food source of #Haíłzaqv @HeiltsukCouncil peoples is real & so is Gov indifference

@UBCIC
3926 2018-10-10 17:04:18 Same with oil. No rally. Weird.
3927 2018-10-10 17:04:17 Nope, just the two
3928 2018-10-10 17:04:17 no but now everytime i get some cheekies all imma be thinking about is tired and oil changes 
3929 2018-10-10 17:03:58 So no one on food stamps in rural Iowa?  Check yourself before you wreck yourself. Unfortunately, @larryelder makes it easy for you to feel this way as if black Americans are the only mooches. What about the oil companies or Wall Street who pay less than their fair share.
3930 2018-10-10 17:03:58 This is partly because they are a stable govt in an oil rich land. But also because they appease the US passively by not being critical of US involvement in the Middle East. The Riyadh air base is often called the mist strategic in the region.
3931 2018-10-10 17:03:50 You insult snake oil salesmen. 
Why?
Why?
3932 2018-10-10 17:03:50 reasons i want a boyfriend: the guy changing my oil just yelled at me because i haven’t got it done in 8 months

I need 8 hours of cardio.
3938 2018-10-10 17:02:45 This was me a week ago. I blame the season change.  tea tree oil was the fix!

4. Counselling 
5. Cutting caffeine when I feel my anxiety is getting out of control

3951 2018-10-10 17:01:38 That oil put me on my ass .
3952 2018-10-10 17:01:31 It’s hard when they are so fucking stupid. Especially in regards to the issues you list. Environment? Stupid people push for oil pipelines that leak. Health? Stupid people rollback women’s reproductive rights. Safe communities? Stupid people won’t enact common sense gun laws.

3965 2018-10-10 17:00:38 I get regularly asked what blockchain is best used for. The answer is obviously with salmon and olive oil
3966 2018-10-10 17:00:32 I worked the Horizon oil spill where Obama ordered the use of chemical agent to sink of large quantities of oil in the Gulf. I said that I thought it was a mistake because the next major hurricane would stir it up and wash it on shore. We are about to find out. I pray I was wrong

Yet this person still consumes animal products on an omni diet. But you wanna tell me about how bad this is for the planet and to make more conscious choices? Ok
3972 2018-10-10 17:00:19 i love the smell of castor oil bc my grandpas dreads always smelled like it 
3973 2018-10-10 17:00:16 Environmentally friendly too - fried bacon, used dripping to fry plantain, used same pan for egg. So no oil used and only one pan to wash. #GoodFood

3977 2018-10-10 16:59:55 cheese on the inside, a thin layer of mayo on the outside (oil + eggs = a beautiful brown crust) -> h e a v e n
3978 2018-10-10 16:59:54 @globepolitics  It will take progressive leadership to promote a balanced plan that leads us from oil dependency in stages while building up a sustainable economy (jobs), as well as building sustainable & modern urban centers.

3980 2018-10-10 16:59:10 Uhm. First and best thing you can do to "protect more of our nature" is to not waste billions of dollars on a rusty, leaky pipeline and a risky expansion project that threatens "our nature". Stopping plastics in the ocean is meaningless if a oil spill happens. #TransMountain
3981 2018-10-10 16:59:02 Let's all invade Saudi Arabia and steal their oil. It'll pay for itself.
3982 2018-10-10 16:58:53 Yes ma'am. Tea tree oil helps when my face feels inflamed too so I'm surviving. Mind you it doesn't look as bad as I'm making it sound but my skin is sensitive and feels so gross sometimes
3983 2018-10-10 16:58:50 you know he's not gonna do anything because he's too afraid of pissing off the saudis and losing the oil!

3986 2018-10-10 16:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3987 2018-10-10 16:58:34 I would have thought that you would have recommended the Rideau oil in this situation. Seems more up the alley of what Mandy is looking for.
3988 2018-10-10 16:58:28 Kagan helped build this jungle by ignoring international law to join in an oil raid.
3989 2018-10-10 16:58:12 So was Jason Kenney saying he has been playing “gutter politics” by attacking the NDP for following through on the oil and gas industry’s request to include Tzeporah Berman in their consultations with environmentalists then? #ABLeg
3990 2018-10-10 16:58:02 It’s crazy how I applaud myself for doing the smallest things. Like you just got an oil change? Yes bitch. You went to the dentist? Great it’s about fucking time.
3991 2018-10-10 16:57:54 Doug Suttles complains about paying taxes in Canada for something that contributes to global-warming, yet he must not be aware that a carbon-tax initiative is also being lobbied by a leading oil company, along with Republicans, to be implemented in the states.
3992 2018-10-10 16:57:54 Just got the oil changed in my car. So, which one of you mf’s wants to race?

3994 2018-10-10 16:57:43 Student-athletes, take care of your class-work today. Don’t complain about a lack of playing time while simultaneously refusing to go to class or turn in your assignments. That’s the equivalent of mixing oil & water. They don’t mix. #Focus #Grind #StudentAthleteSwag 
3995 2018-10-10 16:57:41 Yes, actually. I would like, though, to know why French people have low cancer rate, yet they often drink like 1/2 bottle of wine every day, year after year. The Italians compensate for their wheat intake by pouring olive oil on everything. What do the French do??
3996 2018-10-10 16:57:23 Hi Anna. I oppose drilling for oil off Virginia’s coasts and wish President Trump had not pulled us out of the Paris climate deal, which would’ve done so much globally to tackle climate change. We should be leading on protecting our planet - it’s the only one we've got.
3997 2018-10-10 16:57:02 can ever have plenty of crude oil." Dick blushed and laughed a little forcedly. He didn't like this fellow Robbins.
3998 2018-10-10 16:56:55 u don’t need that much oil tho
3999 2018-10-10 16:56:40 Hmm, specimens who know the oil exploration business!

4001 2018-10-10 16:56:37 How can we demolish entire ecosystems for coal, oil, gas, timber, and water and still think we have enough of a moral standing to complain about how aesthetically displeasing solar fields and wind farms MIGHT be?
4002 2018-10-10 16:56:20 The $DWT worked again for small ball oil trade into /CL 73.20 as outlined, cracking below can get you 72/70 pretty fast, 73.20 working as line in sand for now, nimble wins GL

4004 2018-10-10 16:56:13 wash ur dreads wit black soap then apply olive oil after it dries
4005 2018-10-10 16:56:07 The economic case could be made that Alberta owns its refineries and requires all bitumen purchased from extractors at or above market rates to go through our own refineries. At that point Alberta would sell its own oil and keep 100% of the money instead of piddling royalties.

4009 2018-10-10 16:55:58 Here is one spot I think that racism in medicine/healthcare & public health policy can change, rapidly, to save lives- people should get tested for G6PD Deficiency- Legumes (beans! soybean/“vegetable” oil!) are slow poison for people w G6PD deficiency.
4010 2018-10-10 16:55:57 Not familiar but I just started eating lots of steak/eggs/burgers, cut all grains and seed oil and started doing compound barbell exercises 3x/week and it changed my whole physique.
4011 2018-10-10 16:55:50 Must it be a unilateral wage? I don’t get this country and the block head leaders we have. Can’t each state submit what it can pay? Just like fuel it’s a uniform pump price this is wrong. It should be less in the oil producing states and more in states that don’t produce it.
4012 2018-10-10 16:55:41 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

4013 2018-10-10 16:55:25 I just heard a kid tell this girl "It doesn't matter, you can't put too much oil in the engine" while overfilling her oil. I know this boy was trained by @TrudeMike23
4014 2018-10-10 16:55:10 I NEVER let them change my filters (no matter who changes the oil - dealer or whoever). So much cheaper to buy them (usually better quality) and change myself. 
4015 2018-10-10 16:55:01 Lord that $52 oil change really hurt me 
4016 2018-10-10 16:54:58 “Y’all kill him? No? Ok cool. Y’all got oil?”
4017 2018-10-10 16:54:55 Yeah, because before Oil companies, the climate always stayed the same and there were no hurricanes  #jokes

I once went to Christmas with my mum all hungover. She said she smelled oil or gas just before I snuck into Kmart after her and puked proper in the bathroom. He spidy sense was off that day. 

Your experience is absolutely bonkers.
4019 2018-10-10 16:54:49 there’s a shitton of ants in my car and i have a phobia of ants and i have to sit in my car to wait to get an oil change i’m gonna have a seizure
4020 2018-10-10 16:54:41 The guy at the dealership was trying to force me to get a “new transmission” when I went in for an oil change... I’m good luv, my car is newer than your last season Raf Simons sweater vest, BYE
4021 2018-10-10 16:54:40 Yes.. If religious angle is to  highlight then don't buy oil from Muslim countries
4022 2018-10-10 16:54:30 Cooled toast spread with plain butter and anchovies in olive oil. That’s what I’m going to be making!

4024 2018-10-10 16:54:26 1: We're glad you asked, Marsha! Epi pens are allowed in your purse. Pls remove it from your purse & place in a bin for X-ray screening, at the checkpoint. Bottles of essential oil must be 3.4oz or less and must fit in one quart-sized ...
4025 2018-10-10 16:54:06 Dying because I'm wearing the Abandoned Art Studio perfume oil that Gab gifted me today and the art school nostalgia is like, intense. Scent memory is a weird thing woah. I kinda love it.
4026 2018-10-10 16:54:01 Spilled oil that you put on the warmer all over me.. now I’ve got the worst headache  clearly not my day today 
4027 2018-10-10 16:53:52 I've had to delay a root canal until after the first of the year because my dental insurance reached its cap. On the bright side, using coconut oil after regular brushing really seems to help. The Affordable health care has never been affordable. #UniversalHealthcare is needed.
4028 2018-10-10 16:53:50 Pineapple Vegan body oil.
4029 2018-10-10 16:53:50 This lady at the tire shop just told me she can wait longer to rotate her tires on her car because she uses synthetic oil.
4030 2018-10-10 16:53:50 In fairness, it's a fitting tribute to a man who happily murdered people for oil.
4031 2018-10-10 16:53:48 Why do u have 3 oil replacement tubes???
4032 2018-10-10 16:53:35 Olive Oil 
4033 2018-10-10 16:53:35 Many thanks for your support, Rebecca!
Can you have a word with @claireperrymp & the new Shale Gas Commissioner Natascha Engel? They seem to believe the hype they heard from big oil & gas on their all expenses trip to Pennsylvania! Our friends there never got a chance to speak!
4034 2018-10-10 16:53:31 how sad is it that I’ve been really looking forward to getting an oil change because I know the Jiffy Lube near me has really good magazines
4035 2018-10-10 16:53:27 여름이면 늘 센치한 느낌이 드는데 그 느낌이 너무 좋아서 겨울이 좋다
4036 2018-10-10 16:53:24 'Yellow Revolution' is associated with the production of Oil Seeds
4037 2018-10-10 16:53:10 I'm more upset by the constant subsidies to the oil companies IF the money went to family owned farms and not corporate ones. But, I do agree with you. Money to farmers equals votes from the base. Money for healthcare does not.
4038 2018-10-10 16:53:10 I used my body scrub and body oil today and my skin feel great ♡
4039 2018-10-10 16:53:01 Google has about the same market share as Standard Oil had when the federal govt sought anti trust relief for the American people and broke it into 34 different companies.

This country was FOUNDED on the basis of freedom.
 
Who threatened our freedom when we are constantly "fighting for other people's freedom"? 

how many times were we on a field that WASNT for geopolitcal gain or OIL?

Yeah bye NEXT
4042 2018-10-10 16:52:23 Whenever a commodity trades at decade lows--expect consolidation. In the Canadian oil patch, #Oil today is trading at the biggest discount to U.S. oil in a decade. U.S. benchmark oil (WTI) trades at $73.25/bbl.  CDN W.S oil at $26.25 (64% discount).  Consolidation time.
4043 2018-10-10 16:52:20 How much oil and natural gas do they pump in south-east England?
4044 2018-10-10 16:52:20 going  oil change
4045 2018-10-10 16:52:17 Tried and true, these 100% pure #CBD oil and essential oil blends are ahead of the curve. See their line of convenient vape pens and fast-acting tinctures for yourself at {INSERT YOUR AFFILIATE LINK HERE}
4046 2018-10-10 16:52:15 I might be ugly but atleast i can change my own oil 
4047 2018-10-10 16:52:12 I only wash birds that I have home-oiled myself. Let desired bird(s) soak in oil overnight under a damp cloth. The damp cloth is mostly to keep them from flying away.
4048 2018-10-10 16:52:04 there's nothing like bald men with beards driving dodge rams with oakley oil rigs on
4049 2018-10-10 16:51:59 Pound is up and oil is down 
4050 2018-10-10 16:51:50 Big fan of clove oil, Steffan. It really does deaden a lot of toothache.
4051 2018-10-10 16:51:46 I hate how oily my face gets! I can literally feel the oil resting on my face..
4052 2018-10-10 16:51:38 I aint never heard a female say they need an oil change
4053 2018-10-10 16:51:16 It's ok, D.C. would kill us all before they let that oil go. :)
4054 2018-10-10 16:51:09 Anybody know what to do to get rid of ants? Especially when your place is cleaner than clean? And you've literally tried traps, raid, peppermint oil, cleaning the drains, and mopping/wiping every day? 
THEY'RE. EVERYWHERE. 

THEY GOT IN MY KEURIG

NOBODY RUINS MY HOT CHOCOLATE!!!
4055 2018-10-10 16:51:04 But that can't be right.  As Scotland is continuously told you can't make money from oil at all!
4056 2018-10-10 16:50:46 Le silence, ce bonheur retrouvé de l'après-pétrole.
4057 2018-10-10 16:50:45 Tired of seeing that baby oil bullshit on my TL
4058 2018-10-10 16:50:42 As mentioned in class, but that bears repeating, U.S. military operations in the Middle East are ultimately about oil. Terrorism and security are the public pronouncements meant to conceal this fact.  Everyone working in diplomatic relations around the world is aware of this.
4059 2018-10-10 16:50:41 ya future hubby probably pays someone to change his oil 
4060 2018-10-10 16:50:39 You should try coconut oil
4061 2018-10-10 16:50:21 Fuel taxes except VAT are charged /litre and not dependent on price. As long as energy market is dictated by volatile oil prices it’s too risky for investors to bring alternatives to rural Ireland. The €10/tCO2 suggested increase would have been 3c/l, less than recent price hike
4062 2018-10-10 16:50:16 I need a signed note from my therapist that explains why I waited too long to get my oil changed

4065 2018-10-10 16:50:07 Sitting here, waiting to get my oil changed. Every time I look up, the white man sitting across from me is just staring. Why?
4066 2018-10-10 16:49:58 Oil change be like 250

4071 2018-10-10 16:49:45 good job im in both then..
4072 2018-10-10 16:49:39 That’s completely unrelated. You said the penalty should be death because they sold something that kills thousands. Tobacco companies killed millions and hid their own findings about the harm, just like oil companies. Legal status has nothing to do with morality or deservedness.
4073 2018-10-10 16:49:38 As this killer storm intensifies,remember that Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord out of petty spite, that Scott dismantled environmental protections &weakened building codes, &the entire GOP poo-pooed near total consensus of scientist to pad oil&gas profits. #HurricaneMichael
4074 2018-10-10 16:49:28 Ok if scotland became independent would she be a viable state and own the oil, gas, fishing rights etc
4075 2018-10-10 16:49:25 by the end of the day i can literally start to FEEL the oil collecting on my face and i feel like a wet sock
4076 2018-10-10 16:49:25 Liza Phase 1 is expected to cost $3.2-4.4bn in Capex for 120,000bopd and 450-360mmbbls produced oil. This gives you IRR>20%, and ~$3bn NPV. /6
4077 2018-10-10 16:49:21 oil...no communion...no confession......
4078 2018-10-10 16:49:17 So you don't  consume space oil to keep yourself working properly? Next you'll be saying @jonathansfrakes never had a beard it's all SFX I guess
4079 2018-10-10 16:49:16 Merci de te l’entendre dire. Tu peux ajouter peak oil conventionnel. Ça mange pas de pain.
4080 2018-10-10 16:49:12 With skill and luck, you might find something like Liza, in Guyana (3.5bnbbls oil), or Tortue in Mauritania/Senegal (gas). (Or you may find nothing of course). /5

4086 2018-10-10 16:48:56 Why does it take so long to do an oil change
4087 2018-10-10 16:48:52 Lmaoooo that has castor oil in it. Amongst other things
4088 2018-10-10 16:48:50 There were studies by oil companies that they kept from going public. They knew, right at the start.
4089 2018-10-10 16:48:50 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
4090 2018-10-10 16:48:48 Notice how we have a Pro Oil administration making it easier to pump more oil, and flood the oil markets creating abundant supply.  and yet RIGHT BEFORE ELECTIONS oil prices are at their highest?
4091 2018-10-10 16:48:48 They have too much oil to ever have consequenses
4092 2018-10-10 16:48:41 Lol, no children. And my husband has a perfectly good career. Sorry to burst your bubble but 25$ an hour isn’t shit along with you probably earning it in the “oil fields” typical, I have no degree back end job. & I’m Mexican I’m just saying it’s YOU that makes us look bad. Byeee
4093 2018-10-10 16:48:39 This is all in perspective imo. I'm sure the Industrial & Gilded Ages felt dystopian as well, but they gave us railroads, steel, oil, corporations, cars, etc. Now we have the most powerful communication tool ever developed; there are drawbacks, but the upside is astronomical.
4094 2018-10-10 16:48:38 Sana oil
4095 2018-10-10 16:48:36 Lol, oil and and gas from the US is 20% to 30% more expensive (transport costs), good luck with competing with countries that use cheap gas and oil, your industry will thank you.
4096 2018-10-10 16:48:26 They dragged tata ka Duduzane, they dragged Nene for his son's oil deal...
They started it.
4097 2018-10-10 16:48:24 Also, most bugs dislike peppermint oil essence. That is suppose to help. We used it in NS for the ants and it really helped keep them out of the house. I’d sprinkle it along the door steps and window ledges. Maybe you can try that. It’s environmentally friendly too.
4098 2018-10-10 16:48:22 Koi 1 ya 2 billion dollar mila tha aur bohat sara oil bhi credit per mila tha. Jab nawaz gaya tha shah salman khud lainay aaya tha. 
4099 2018-10-10 16:48:21 @realDonaldTrump you fool no one with your phony press conference. You are a monster who could care less about the fate of folks in Fl.  You are an embarrassment to our nation and a threat to the entire world. Keep supporting oil companies u idiot!
4100 2018-10-10 16:48:20 If spending 70$ on a bottle makes you worried and require a guarantee, you're not yet in the social class to pay such price for oil.

And no, I'm not paying 70$ for oil either, but I don't whine about prices when it's a free market.
4101 2018-10-10 16:48:14 Lmao use the snake oil lol
4102 2018-10-10 16:48:11 Let's think about what $5bn buys you in oil and gas. Let’s assume you’re a pure-frontier explorer, with no existing basin drillout. Of the $5bn in the bank you spend $1bn on exploration. /2

4112 2018-10-10 16:47:08 Exxon et Al. have known this for years. Oil interests want to keep the world dependent on oil & to ally with RU to control and ship arctic oil. They get Dominionists to agree it’s fine to speed up the heat death of the planet & propose to build walls to stop northern migration.
4113 2018-10-10 16:47:04 Increase $ price: The only bad effect will be on import of patrol Diesel, crude oil, furnace oil, 
That has to be managed,
The IMF wanted to increase prices on consumer goods , it can not as 50% imports expected to drop.
And local industry to produce same

4117 2018-10-10 16:46:23 EIA: "Recent price increases indicate that oil market participants have concerns about the ability of Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members, and Russia to continue to offset expected further production declines in Iran and in Venezuela."
4118 2018-10-10 16:46:18 I think they are brainwashed.  Trump is a top notch con man.  Snake oil salesman.  People who are desperate want to believe.
4119 2018-10-10 16:46:17 Gah, I have the Superseed one (which is INCREDIBLE on my ridiculously sensitive skin) and a few months ago coughed up for the even more expensive accompanying facial oil. Good grief though, they’re so good.

4127 2018-10-10 16:45:10 Great interview, makes me happy I scrounge up a few bucks for the real news every month. This report is an excellent summing up of the UN report (and goes beyond it well), a clear, no sugar-coating outline of how bad it's looking. Would never get through MSM oil lobby deference.

4129 2018-10-10 16:44:53 @narendramodi Must you always sleep without any concern for the public? Under your purview, the oil companies have lifted up the prices half way to the sky, still you and your people are in deep sleep. Why should people pay tax to the Govt.?
4130 2018-10-10 16:44:49 A bit too late. You were in on the oil rush like everyone else!

4132 2018-10-10 16:44:41 You must be joking. Most senate democrats are republican accomplices and ALL Ds voted 4 the #BloatedMilitaryBudget which sucks the life out of middle class and poor to pay for the oil wars of #USOligarchs who donate to both parties to assure massive returns irrespective of party.

4140 2018-10-10 16:44:02 Meanwhile, the left calls it 'peaceful protest' and urges mobs to 'keep up the good work'.
4141 2018-10-10 16:43:46 I don’t get it. What does it mean to ”produce emissions” here? Do coal/oil/gas companies actually produce more emissions by producing coal/oil/gas than the rest of us burning their products?
4142 2018-10-10 16:43:46 I've got to find a place here that does that. I want to try CBD oil too.

4151 2018-10-10 16:43:05 should suspend the pricing formula immediately, and peg the price of oil at a reasonable level, that would benefit both the people and Petroleum Corporation. Hopefully, this would be a temporary phenomenon, and with the mid-term elections in the US in November, if there is a

Ted Cruz put his reputation on the line over RFS reform for refiners (from PA???, but that is another story) and now his boss is "giving away" 5% of refiners 'market share. Oil Patch ain't gonna be happy, and Cruz hurtin'.

4161 2018-10-10 16:41:54 Agree about cbd oil. It’s legal in all states, as long as it has no thc. The THC isn’t necessary for the cancer fighting effects. The kind I buy online from Lazarus Naturals is very good. They offer a big discount if you’re on disability.

4168 2018-10-10 16:41:20 @TristinHopper just a quick comment about your article about LNG. The current research suggests that dilbit is more resistant to sinking than conventional crude as it forms larger oil balls that float better. Also conventional crudes are more prone to emulsification in rough seas

Childhood in the 50s - unbelievably boring, and olive oil was something you put in your ears when they hurt. 60s - actually, quite fun. 70s - wretched, and I wouldn't want to go back there.

4297 2018-10-10 16:27:47 $CL_F 71.35 - 68.94 is next area of interest to complete 7 swings lower and should produce a 3 waves bounce at least #Elliottwave #Oil
4298 2018-10-10 16:27:43 We wouldn’t need the guns. We have home grown, corn fed, country boys and girls who grew up working on the farm, in the oil fields, and on logging jobs. We would just beat their ass and send them home to mommy crying.

4303 2018-10-10 16:27:19 $CL_F While below 75.29 high, should ideally do another swing lower to complete 7 swings down from the peak #Elliottwave #Oil

4305 2018-10-10 16:27:09 Too bad they don't want people to know pollution affects the weather!! XD LOL They don't want the ( corrupt) EPA ( gas/oil people in charge/not caring) to acknowledge this because then they'd have to pollute less and that's cost companies a little more money. Air,water,soil care
4306 2018-10-10 16:26:59 وعليكم السلام .. أنا اشتريت من أمازون زيت يطوّل الشعر يجنن يطوله ويكثفه بس عاد ريحته شوي مقرفه  اسمه wild growth hair oil والعلبة حقته تآخذ وقت طووويل مره وسعره رخيص ويجنن يجنن يجنن نصيحه استخدميه ..
4307 2018-10-10 16:26:55 $CL_F made a new low below 10/8 low and now showing 5 swings down from the peak at 10/3 #Elliottwave #Oil
4308 2018-10-10 16:26:42 I got an oil pen again after not having one for like monthssss and I’ve been just stoned consistently since Friday and I am not complaining
4309 2018-10-10 16:26:42 Gotta be some cams from some of the oil platforms in the Gulf
4310 2018-10-10 16:26:37 the @WSJopinion editorial board would like you to know they would each personally murder 500 gay Brazilians to privatize oil handling operations and tax cuts
4311 2018-10-10 16:26:33 Or we could also stop subsidizing oil and gas industries, and subsidizing more renewables? That would be a start!
4312 2018-10-10 16:26:32 Tea tree oil lang sis hahaaha
4313 2018-10-10 16:26:25 To get an "OIL GAURD" screw replaced is AT WORST A WHEEL OFF-SCREW-ON+RETURN WHEEL-For me a MISSON-NEIGHBOUR SAID DO TODAY NOW IF+BUTTING!!
4314 2018-10-10 16:26:24 As if Steven has lost the oil cap on my car !!! Thought my car was on fire, oh no it’s just been the smell of oil flying around. Kill me now
4315 2018-10-10 16:26:21 If my mum sells palm oil and
My dad sells gas and I tell my girlfriend...
my parents are into oil and gas am I wrong?

4316 2018-10-10 16:26:19 During periods of financial chaos oil markets go down not because of a huge fall in demand but rather as a result of HFT attacks on oil by the State. Cheap oil, like low interest rates, are QE for our very very fragile Keynesian financial system. Why do you think they blame oil?
4317 2018-10-10 16:26:15 Oil sauce? Abi Yam and Oil
4318 2018-10-10 16:26:08 Ugly red day in the financial markets today especially for Canadian Oil&Gas. 
$CPG down 6%, also probably best stock to face rising borrowing costs.

Canadian oil&gas is probably the most undervalued sector. Hopefully a new government in 2019 will bring new markets & confidence.

4322 2018-10-10 16:25:59 I've heard anecdotally that they're very efficient - about half full with olive oil will last between 6-8 hours.
4323 2018-10-10 16:25:40 I friend it and then marinated it in soy aminos and a little bit of sesame oil. I added some Worcestershire at the end :3
4324 2018-10-10 16:25:28 If you're frying French fries in the same oil used to fry chicken or fish, your fries are not vegan.
4325 2018-10-10 16:25:22 Try wild growth oil I’ve heard great things about it
4326 2018-10-10 16:25:05 Your very correct,because when he called subsidy a scam we bought fuel for lower price even when oil price was high.oil price went down we bought fuel at a higher price even with subsidy
4327 2018-10-10 16:25:02 Can someone pull up a chart of campaign contributions by big oil PACs for the last few years? I’d be willing to bet you’ll see a large decline.
4328 2018-10-10 16:24:53 I love Hillary Clinton. 

Her hypocrisy is rich as a great Northern American dam, she holds so much yet has zero self-awareness nor any mirrors in her house. If it were oil, America would be rich as an oil exporter to other countries.
4329 2018-10-10 16:24:53 People act like you don’t eat a lot of veggies on keto, but I just ate a bushel of spinach and a few fistfuls of green onions with a sprinkle of lemon juice and olive oil and I’m too full to move now what was I saying?
4330 2018-10-10 16:24:43 WTI oil at $74.78/barrel, -$0.18.
4331 2018-10-10 16:24:23 I came back home w/ 5 yrs of jail work, tried to get access to death row, was gatekept, no place for women; but it’s ok to kill a person?
4332 2018-10-10 16:24:15 @TheBullBull with crude oil and dollar down, what kind of impact would it have on nifty tomorrow? On other side, all other index are down.
4333 2018-10-10 16:24:11 Even after all these years they STILL haven't finished oil exploration. When will the Nat's stop this vanity project? This is simply intolllerible.
4334 2018-10-10 16:24:10 It is the collective dark night of the soul - those of us who are awakened and sentient. It can be assuaged in tiny little acts of kindness towards a stranger, a hand on the shoulder of a homeless person, a warm smile for an elderly stranger. Start there. It helps. Also CBD oil

4337 2018-10-10 16:23:56 I was just wondering if you are also aware of the drilling that’s being done by Zion oil and gas In the Megiddo Jezreel Valley?
4338 2018-10-10 16:23:46 The Saudi's have pulled most everything out of. Winter is arriving & 1 last straw would be the cancellation of Saudi oil sales to Chuckles our Clown Prince.
Ironic isn't it, our clown prince calling out a real Crown Prince? Wonder who has more to loose? No pipeline either.

4342 2018-10-10 16:23:21 I think that’s why people haven’t talked much about the Emily palette. Because it’s Makeup revolution which isn’t known for great makeup and no one wants to put down another Beautubers collab. You can handle the heat, Tati. You did with your snake oil so you can with this
4343 2018-10-10 16:23:20 Alternativeky, they believe big oil is so untouchable that it's not even worth bringing up...
4344 2018-10-10 16:23:18 Drink 4. And follow other things. Switch to food made in ghee rather than oil.

4346 2018-10-10 16:23:15 EIA sees OPEC-15 crude oil production up 120kbpd to 32.68kbpd in September, with losses in Iran (-120kbpd) offset by gains in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia (both each 100kbpd), Libya (90kbpd) and Nigeria, Iraq (both 70k).

4356 2018-10-10 16:22:45 Money might be better spent donating towards the legal team doing the class action law suit against big oil.

4358 2018-10-10 16:22:41 See? Each barrel of Saudi or other M.E. Oil we buy (or Western nations buy because we get most of our imported oil from Canada), we help support terrorists. That is one reason I have been imploring people to develop alternative and clean energy.

4363 2018-10-10 16:22:19 Don't know. Don't care. It would follow instantly only randomly. Physical oil market lags futures. If the oil price collapses then if my thesis is correct $ should trend down too. If not, then my thesis is incorrect

4372 2018-10-10 16:21:42 Actually he suggested spending the money from pipeline projects on opening refineries here so we could be less dependant on foreign oil, and didn't need to ship it away to be refined.

4377 2018-10-10 16:21:12 We own you, and not the other way around we let you survive because you do our work like a little bitch and sell your oil in US dollar, any time we want you gone you are gone but we will let you suffer from now on. Why are you on twiter? Yemeni's are getting closer :)
4378 2018-10-10 16:20:59 ok I have a problem, I usually say words the American way like "toe-may-toe" but American words really confuse me.

did you forget it was a potato? they're crisps. crispy. light. full of sat and oil to damage your health. CRISSSSPS
4379 2018-10-10 16:20:55 Applying the fuel price formula when oil prices are on the upward trend internationally due to the erratic behaviour of Donald Trump in withdrawing from the JCPOA or Iran Nuclear Deal and applying sanctions on Iran, is very unfair or unreasonable. When fuel prices were very low
4380 2018-10-10 16:20:50 This is the sun will evaporate the oil, & the gimme gimmes' diva covers album that is real as fuck.
4381 2018-10-10 16:20:37 If you're broke as fuck like me and need a chemical exfoliator I highly recommend the Ordinary's peel. If you've got skin that will become way too flaky by applying straight tea tree oil to ur skin, u can dilute it in water for a toner or put a drop or two in ur wash/moisturizer

4383 2018-10-10 16:20:26 True, but energy drives the economy, without oil, there is no real estate, there is no banking etc. The economic success of Texas is not red or blue,  it is black which turns into green.   Don’t believe me,  go research the 80’s oil bust and tell me how the economy was then.

4394 2018-10-10 16:19:27 CEO and President of Amos Global Energy, Ali Moshiri tells #OM2018 that "2025/2026 will see a peak in US tight oil - we are running out of a sweet spot."

4400 2018-10-10 16:19:10 It’s not even cheese. It’s usually emulsified oil. 
4401 2018-10-10 16:19:06 Palm oil sucks the ground dry of nutrients and adds nothing of value to it, especially in tropical regions, where most plantations are.
Also, the stems are all burned after harvest, because you cannot use them for anything else.
You can’t make wood products out of them.

4406 2018-10-10 16:18:06 Do you anticipate strikes in the oil industry or in any other export-oriented sector of the Iranian economy?
4407 2018-10-10 16:18:01 Can't count how many times I read the same type of headline each time oil hit a new high over the last year. Eventually someone will be right. Just like a broken clock. #OOTT
4408 2018-10-10 16:17:55 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.

4410 2018-10-10 16:17:50 Nobody said only California will benefit from green technologies, genius. Besides, more developed countries will start demanding LESS oil as time goes by, further plummeting demand. It only makes sense to encourage the adoption of new, alternative energy sources
4411 2018-10-10 16:17:46 We take back Congress, House and Senate, that will be a big step in saving the planet. Bills will get passed to protect the environment, National Parks and wildlife. And not lift regulations that allow oil co’s to drill wherever, for profits.
4412 2018-10-10 16:17:41 Most of the oil blocs are allocated & own by Northerners.

4416 2018-10-10 16:17:22 The sell off is likely the result of Hurricane Michael and the damage it will do to Gulf oil operations, etc.
4417 2018-10-10 16:17:22 Gimana ga bisa naik.. Crude oil dunia saja sudah sudah mencapai level tertingi per 1 barelnya 73.300 @Fadlizon Saat ini..

4419 2018-10-10 16:17:00 Oh, ok then. YAY for fracking Waste now unregulated and oil companies can pollute the Gulf coast as much as companies want now!!! Yes!!! Who wants to go swimming?!!
4420 2018-10-10 16:16:46 I have also lived without them.  I am in ND.  When the oil boom hit, we had such a shortage of workers that  there was no one to stock store shelves or work the tills. There were no workers at restaurants and the casinos.   They are an asset we are throwing away, and we will pay

4422 2018-10-10 16:16:35 I am glad you spoke up. Everything makes sense. It takes courage. And it’s still unbelievable to me how many stories are still hidden.

4424 2018-10-10 16:16:23 Make no mistake - the sudden #Russian interest in the #Golan heights has ALL to do with oil we found there. Are they into spoils of war? Ask the prophet #Ezekiel!
4425 2018-10-10 16:16:06 えぇ、、、大変やな
4426 2018-10-10 16:15:57 Stop buying Venezuela oil
4427 2018-10-10 16:15:52 I feel like the best way to combat these aggressive hurricanes is to burn more coal and oil. That is what the bible says in Mark 2:77 "Lo, climate science is a liberal conspiracy funded by George Soros and Kathy Griffin. Your God made coal and lifted Fords, fuck snowflakes".
4428 2018-10-10 16:15:52 EIA's 2018 non-OPEC supply growth forecast has been raised to 2.41mbpd (was 2.31mbpd) and the 2019 to 2.27mbpd (was2.0mbpd). US oil production growth was raised by 110kbpd to 2mbpd in 2018, and by 190kbpd to 1.44mbpd in 2019.

4508 2018-10-10 16:07:51 It involved forecasting. Locke himself said it was meant to give idea of futures, his best understanding at time of outlook (uses oil forecasts for example). In his own words "You're going to be wrong no matter what." Capital cost (from Nalcor) was main change over time.

4513 2018-10-10 16:07:29 So now that oil slammed down from $75 @FoxBusiness says they will "later" explain why oil is down, zero predictive value, market levels explained "after" they happen, zero predictive value, you have zero friends on finmed, quite the opposite
4514 2018-10-10 16:07:28 @jiffylube your service is always quick and professional...but since when do you charge $24.99 labor in ADDITION to the oil change charge ($69.99)? NOTHING extra was done.

4564 2018-10-10 16:03:17 That's funny.  "EM's are screwed"...but "oil demand is up"?
4565 2018-10-10 16:03:14 #OctoberFalls18

the opaline sea
was born
of another oil spill
that has stained
not just the birds
& once pristine
shoreline
but the dreams
of innocence
dancing
in our heads

4566 2018-10-10 16:03:02 Is that a serious question?  It's Alberta oil they were protesting.
4567 2018-10-10 16:03:00 I was girl in the oil patch from the ages of 18-30. I would dare you to walk a day in my shoes. Tell me, would u rather be the man or the woman in this situation. 
I would dare u to walk a day in my shoes during that time. Perhaps that’s what it would take. 
I’m done now.

4571 2018-10-10 16:02:36 Raheem just ordered a #Fiix mechanic to come to their house for a Oil and Filter Change (Synthetic) on their Honda!  #Markham #Toronto #Tech
4572 2018-10-10 16:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

4575 2018-10-10 16:02:13 I cooked with grape seed oil, today. It’s over for you hoes.
4576 2018-10-10 16:02:13 Went to change my oil @TiresPlus coral Gables and broke my car key. Nows been 5 days and they pass me around. Very unhappy and never again I go to @TiresPlus
4577 2018-10-10 16:02:13 I always try and tell people this  I use all natural shea butter or coconut oil for dry lips

4579 2018-10-10 16:01:59 Thoughts from my #roadtrip: anyone who opposes wind power because they don't like how it looks should take a good, long look at an oil rig (to say nothing of the stench)
4580 2018-10-10 16:01:54 U.S. EIA RAISES FORECAST FOR 2019 WORLD OIL DEMAND GROWTH BY 20,000 BPD, NOW SEES 1.49 MLN BPD YR-ON-YR INCREASE: EIA. #OOTT
4581 2018-10-10 16:01:52 Not enough demand. I think you can use malmal- has the added benefit of being reusable!
4582 2018-10-10 16:01:46 Yeah you gotta only use coconut oil when you're sure the flavor won't dominate. (I remember Magary bitching about that lol.) It's been the ideal one for thin pork chops on the stovetop. Avoid for any non-heat usage, a disaster.
4583 2018-10-10 16:01:44 Shekhar chupta. Apne sir me Jony Walker se oil message kara,नये ideas नहीं आते तेरी गंजी खोपड़ी मे

4586 2018-10-10 16:01:27 Only two sectors beating $SPY meaningfully since 8-15 low?  $XLE and then $XLV. Oil is extended IMO in face of Ex-US economic slowing. $SPX

4589 2018-10-10 16:01:07 This is stunning, Rosa. The colours and light make the landscape look like an oil painting xo 
4590 2018-10-10 16:01:05 I do not like rapeseed oil Dorothy, never have. Canola is for me not something I ever want to eat. I use 90% of the time Extra Virgin Olive oil and butter to cook with. Almost always have.
4591 2018-10-10 16:01:04 It tastes like nothing to me. I only use it for browning meat when I need an oil that can get really hot and it imparts no flavor. I wouldn't use for a salad.
4592 2018-10-10 16:00:57 Wow use coconut oil then
4593 2018-10-10 16:00:53 Pop about a tablespoon of olive oil in the pan and spread it around before putting the bacon in. Reduces splatter, cooks everything better, and gives a nice hint of extra flavor!
4594 2018-10-10 16:00:50 It’s because of Oil. All presidents since World War II have played this game.
4595 2018-10-10 16:00:49 Is it possible to trade members of the media? Maybe we can trade him for a bad skin rash and a lifetime supply of castor oil

4601 2018-10-10 16:00:25 the biggest threat to Alaska is trump and the EPA. you're going to lose more animals than anyone if you don't stop ALL mining, all oil/gas projects.  we don't need them. we have enough.
4602 2018-10-10 16:00:23 Sometimes I pet my cat and she immediately cleans the spot I touched. What the fuck. Is my skin oil not good enough for you
4603 2018-10-10 16:00:21 Honda did my oil change & tire rotation the filter all that shit ion know about for free 
4604 2018-10-10 16:00:06 For sure. Don’t forget the Bush era war(s) for oil and fighting enemies in the WRONG country. More deaths there than Benghazi but.... her emails.
4605 2018-10-10 16:00:01 Iraq's Minister of Oil said that all new contracts with foreign oil companies must stipulate that 85 percent of those hired for a project must be Iraqi #Iraq
4606 2018-10-10 15:59:55 Sure lets drop the fictional oil subsidies then get rid of federal state and local tax credits, all manufacture ZEV credits, get rid of all gasoline taxes federal and state and switch to a vehicle miles traveled tax.    Then we might approach something that is level.
4607 2018-10-10 15:59:54 Pake oil wood white
4608 2018-10-10 15:59:53 Cdn oil & gas stocks getting absolutely smoked today.
4609 2018-10-10 15:59:51 Coconut oil maybe since it does have natural antibacterial properties but eye wouldn’t even use that on a good day lol like just wild some girl(s) probably tested this out and is paying for it now lol
4610 2018-10-10 15:59:45 Sometimes all you need is ur fave essential oil 
4611 2018-10-10 15:59:38 I'll buy you all the Jamaican oil and Cantu so you can grow it back 
4612 2018-10-10 15:59:34 Florida Republicans don't want to say 'climate change'.

Climate change is producing historic #HurricaneMichael 

You vote for Republicans, you get ignorance & the worst results.

You get uneducated politicians paid by Big Oil/Koch to refute scientists.
4613 2018-10-10 15:59:31 All those girls that cook naked aren’t really cooking. You ever had oil pop and hit your boob? I’m pretty sure I saw Jesus accepting me into heaven at that moment.
4614 2018-10-10 15:59:31 No one is asking for "free everything". We are asking for basic services our tax dollars should already be paying for. Shrink the defense budget. We currently have socialism for the big corporations- especially oil and arms manufacturers. We THE PEOPLE demand more than WAR.
4615 2018-10-10 15:59:27 Yeah, I only use non-olive oil when I need a flavorless fat to brown meats. I don't like coconut oil because I don't like the taste of coconut, but all the others work.
4616 2018-10-10 15:59:23 Just when this billionaire and his Saudi buddies thought they gotta diversify their portfolios and lower exposure to oil ... bam! I wonder if they’ll be doubling down on $SNAP

4628 2018-10-10 15:58:34 That’s fine, but that is not how energy production has ever gone down in the US. Renewables may not have been mandated against per se, but let’s not pretend oil and gas companies haven’t spent billions fighting them.

4630 2018-10-10 15:58:22 Happy #WorldMentalHealthDay

4631 2018-10-10 15:58:17 Saw new book from @PoitrasBook about #EnergyEast - hope it mentions foreign oil imports to Canada.

Also curious, where the cover photo is from? Is that a Canadian pipeline?
4632 2018-10-10 15:58:14 Welp, I can now mark oil change off my check list 
4633 2018-10-10 15:57:59 If anything the subsidies for EV's should be extended even longer while subsidies for gas and oil be less overtime to promote the change to both greener infrastructure and use of energy. @SenJohnBarrasso supports Killing Americans as well as American jobs.

4639 2018-10-10 15:57:20 Usd is a ticking time bomb.dollar will fail. Stock buy backs are garbage economy is in tank, interest rates rising, othercountries finding ways to bye oil outside dollar, countries abandoning dollar, huge debt, bank bail outs, corruption and lies from centralized corporation/bank
4640 2018-10-10 15:57:06 Not to mention the death toll of American service personnel coming back from this hell. Great job Democrat’s for voting to give more money to the military to send more men and women to their deaths for oil
4641 2018-10-10 15:56:49 The State of Florida is voting on an amendment to prevent oil drilling beneath waters controlled by the state.

But they also added in that it would make vaping illegal in indoor work spaces??

why are these together lol
4642 2018-10-10 15:56:46 Try mixing the peppermint oil with baking soda and sprinkle it where you see the spiders. Just make sure the peppermint oil is pure and not cut with another oil.
4643 2018-10-10 15:56:44 @sfaquestions cheapest place to get your oil changed in Nac?
4644 2018-10-10 15:56:44 The gf and I make sure we're stocked with decent-quality olive oil from Trader Joe's, but we use coconut oil when possible (it's a good, arguably healthier alternate but doesn't always play well). And there's a world of other oils out there: avocado, grapeseed, etc etc.
4645 2018-10-10 15:56:44 How does SPY earnings support that? Capital will shift from risk to risk-free. Already we're seeing impact in home construction, auto sales, regionals, basic industry; moreover, higher rates turns oil importing cur acct def EM into bad credits cc @teasri
4646 2018-10-10 15:56:39 Just got a oil change the floater is back floating again 
4647 2018-10-10 15:56:36 We need to do absolutely everything we can to end our reliance on fossil fuel consumption. The habitability of our planet is literally at stake. Anything that moves us farther away from using oil as a fuel source is a good thing.
4648 2018-10-10 15:56:34 Madam: Debt is matched by a corresponding asset (HPCL, other gas blocks etc). These are good operating domestic assets. Your master pushed down ONGC's throat Imperial Energy (Russian 3rd grade oil co) at swanky valuations. You forgot? Oh! Whom am I telling... sorry! You shout 
4649 2018-10-10 15:56:31 Exactly they have the money to do whatever they want & when the oil is gone they will have control of the alternative energy as well
4650 2018-10-10 15:56:31 I'm a big fan of BeardBrand, but it's a bit pricey. I've also stopped using the oil and switched to a Cremo Balm.

4663 2018-10-10 15:55:22 Why are nuts and oils so expensive? Like I’m making the chicken and broccoli and i just know the goddamn sesame oil or seeds gonna be expensive. Or like when i wanna make a pesto and the goddamn pine nuts is $15 per 1/2 pound like i don’t get it
4664 2018-10-10 15:55:10 An oil free floor
4665 2018-10-10 15:55:07 hell sell off the nationalized oil industry to predatory international capitalists so probably yeah.
4666 2018-10-10 15:55:04 I think he is suggesting Putin might be there to help us out with a favourable interest rate to keep the lights on in our schools when the secret oil fields dry up.

Like all Nationalist solutions to difficult questions, its a heady mix of fantasy, delusion, idiocy and denial.

4682 2018-10-10 15:53:58 I checked because the gas tax was in affect months ago. Found this information. “Analysts say drivers should expect gas prices to drop less than they usually do in the Fall, as looming U.S. sanctions on Iran boost the cost of oil.”
4683 2018-10-10 15:53:50 Did not know we produce barrells of oil! Good to know! 
4684 2018-10-10 15:53:41 no oil painting

美しくない人
4685 2018-10-10 15:53:40 I know this tax will get tossed or lowered but it’s all greed coz like you said we need alternative renewable energy resource that won’t effect the oil & economy which is impossible unfortunately

4687 2018-10-10 15:53:12 The GOP's new talking point is that Dem's want us to be like Venezuela - but the Government doesn't own the oil companies, airlines or most of anything in the US... it's a bad analogy. Medicare for all would be in line with every other major country in the world.

4692 2018-10-10 15:52:36 Cox can’t forget this aspect as well. “Analysts say drivers should expect gas prices to drop less than they usually do in the Fall, as looming U.S. sanctions on Iran boost the cost of oil.”

4695 2018-10-10 15:52:21 Libya is turning to #Russia for assistance on oil - NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla just said that over recent weeks he held "a series of meetings" with Russian officials to try and crack down on oil smugglers that are taking crude out of the country. #Libya #oott #upstream #energy

4700 2018-10-10 15:51:43 maybe try to dissolve the adhesive with a skin oil?
4701 2018-10-10 15:51:38 What word are you substituting energy for? Tar sands? Trying to sell him tar sands? Gimme a break, Andrew. Get off the oil train. Stop polluting.
4702 2018-10-10 15:51:33 I'm absolutely certain it has to to with extraction of resources like oil, timber etc.
4703 2018-10-10 15:51:28 I have a 22 year old Ford Mustang GT and my local Ford dealership said they had too much work to do an oil change for me. Hence, the quick lube shop it is for me. Of course, when my Mustang needed more extensive work I did not use the dealership. Poor service.
4704 2018-10-10 15:51:13 Just tried a new recipe for beans with tomatoes and no palm oil! Bliss!
4705 2018-10-10 15:51:02 What's wrong with canola oil? I don't really use it, but should I be avoiding it?
4706 2018-10-10 15:50:57 We have to do both: legislation to curb both consumption and production. Free market philosophy isn’t enough. Again, we’d be naive to believe the oil and gas industry would support legislation that curbs fossil fuel consumption.
4707 2018-10-10 15:50:33 And watching series on their laptops
4708 2018-10-10 15:50:25 Oil change and flat tire, welcome back to reality 
4709 2018-10-10 15:50:08 It would be a mistake to trust oil companies. CEOs are the highest paid liars on earth. There is tremendous competition for their jobs, so they are very good at lying. They do not expect their companies to reduce fossil fuel production. Grow or die is their motto.
4710 2018-10-10 15:50:06 Reduce price all item for the poor people of Pakistani like GAS,/ oil/ those who are living below poverty ,they suffered asked AU!!! Returned all taxes,your MPA 's,received this month salary slip.without taxes??

4712 2018-10-10 15:50:00 .@SenJohnBarrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who received $497,750 from Oil and Gas Interests between 2013 and 2018, has introduced a new bill to end the $7,500 federal tax credit for #electriccars and instead tax them more. What an ass clown. He's up for re-election next month.
4713 2018-10-10 15:49:58 These morons are the old guard old money globalist elitists & their (p)sycophantic servants responsible 4 such wonders as the fiat dollar based on GDP, not based on gold standard, "free market gold & oil pricing" OPEC. the world trade organization, the UN...

4715 2018-10-10 15:49:28 i appreciate it being called climate genocide now bc in my lifetime we were starting to address global warming, until oil companies and their political allies nipped that in the bud
4716 2018-10-10 15:49:26 Noooo  Have you tried rosehip oil? Works amazing and no breakouts!

4719 2018-10-10 15:49:14 I'm sort of bittersweet about that downside to learning to cook. I'm by no means a wizard in the kitchen but I'm somewhat ruined for restaurant food, especially now that I know some fundamentals like "don't fuck w/canola oil, ever ever ever".
4720 2018-10-10 15:49:13 It’s a lot easier for someone to reduce the amount of meat and dairy you eat in a day than to go out and buy a $40,000 electric vehicle to get away from the oil industry. Of course there are ways to avoid driving but changing your diet is an easier first step to help the planet
4721 2018-10-10 15:49:12 Eurodollars have provided dollars outside of Fed influence and censorship for decades. During cold war Russians used them for interest gains, sanctioned countries use them for oil. They exist in digital forms on bank balance sheets all over the world.
4722 2018-10-10 15:49:10 My edges need God & Black castor oil 

Also, this natural hair month better do right by me 
4723 2018-10-10 15:49:03 I'd be really interested to find out what the Democrats do that makes them feel.they dont understand in relationship to what the conservatives do that make them feel they do understand. Oil maybe.
4724 2018-10-10 15:48:58 Muscle cream and warm muscle oil is my new squad. That’s all I need to survive back-to-back workout sessions.
4725 2018-10-10 15:48:48 There are only five viable ways of powering civilisation, coal,oil,gas,hydroelectric,nuclear. Everything else is vastly inferior. Solar is important on satellites for the global economy but grid scale it’s terrible.
4726 2018-10-10 15:48:47 Under Buhari, $25billion stolen in NNPC, N1.4trillion stolen from oil subsidy, 18 unregistered companies lifted oil, diverted N1.1trillion, N18billion from IDP funds, N25billion stolen from National Health Insurance Fund, NHIS, and many more stealings. Vote out Buhari in 2019!
4727 2018-10-10 15:48:42 Bullshit!
4728 2018-10-10 15:48:32 Paling sebel adalah kalau salah spelling nama. Nama Olivia, ada yg nulis Olive lah, Olif lah, Oliev lah. Olive Oil kaliii

4734 2018-10-10 15:47:59 The willful ignorance is everywhere in the industry As an electronics tech I have only ever been able to find jobs in oil field support and at my current job a large amount of the people actually believe that Fracking is a much greener way to extract oil
4735 2018-10-10 15:47:51 Haven't seen cooking oil in the last 5days let alone Roil.
4736 2018-10-10 15:47:43 Which hazel , Vitamin e oil , Tea tree oil , soap n glory and anything from mario badescu line. Good luck!!
4737 2018-10-10 15:47:33 SERVICE WHILE YOU WAIT thru Sat!

4738 2018-10-10 15:47:31 PSA!! 
Do NOT cook/use/or eat Canola Oil!! It is a toxic, synthetic oil that is regestered by the EPA as a damn pesticide!!! Use avocado oil or grapeseed oil when cooking and Olive or Coconut Oil when adding to dishes!!! Much healthier option and contains more nutrients.
4739 2018-10-10 15:47:14 Cassandre ? Le peak oil conventionnel ça fait pas plus de dix ans qu'on l'a atteint ?
4740 2018-10-10 15:46:51 君の開放記念だし、君に任せるよ。
ちなみにENDO君は平日なら参加できるって。
4741 2018-10-10 15:46:46 Disagree, they declared our dying loyalty to oil eploration.
That is why I am proposing Windyday Concept.
Convert weapons factories to battery and solar panels.  Train young to do Green Jobs.  Plant local farms, with Hemp as carbon capture and replace plastics.
Swiss have said NO
4742 2018-10-10 15:46:46 I agree but those oil companies don’t want to share / decrease their profit & they have the money to buy patents of alternative energy resources & shelf it They got the money they win either way
4743 2018-10-10 15:46:45 Hence no haggling on earthen lamps,patakhas,,oil,flowers,and all linked to Laxmi Pooja.
4744 2018-10-10 15:46:45 It’s because you took down the Twin Towers. Nobody actually believes you. Just want your oil.
4745 2018-10-10 15:46:30 The Man who took care of my Oil Change on my Jeep today was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! VERY professional, EXTREMELY helpful & I will ONLY take my Jeep here for Service!! Great job Valvoline!!!
4746 2018-10-10 15:46:24 The segment instead focused heavily on political implications, how oil states oppose the change. @MorningEdition is some of the least focused, poorly balanced, unthoughtful "journalism" @NPR has to offer and @KUOW insisting on it's vitality is a major reason I am not donating 2/2
4747 2018-10-10 15:46:23 I had it before, the oil kept separating and it was really thick.
4748 2018-10-10 15:46:20 It’s a blend from Doterra but just mentioning bc it might do more than just help with mood, it’ll be going into your lungs and idk how well oil can be purged from the lung, or how much is too much. 
4749 2018-10-10 15:46:18 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ #PalmOil producers  Unless the Palm Oil industry  and illegal logging stopped we will loose this beautiful ape!
4750 2018-10-10 15:46:12 nothing makes me feel manlier than having another man change my oil
4751 2018-10-10 15:46:08 Confused market:

- Stage 1: Oil  》UST yields 
- Stage 2: Strong US non-mnfg ISM 》 UST yields  》US $ 
- Stage 3: EM , stocks 
- Stage 4: Oil now , UST yields , US $ , EM stays , stocks stay 

Ranges to tighten. Realised volatility compressing?

4757 2018-10-10 15:45:25 Trump can do tremendous damage esp re climate change. I don't see the Ds as our saviors tho. They take oil $. HC pushed fracking all over the world. She hid KXL contractor ties & let oil man hired by KXL write State Dept environmental impact statement
4758 2018-10-10 15:45:20 No way!! What oil?!

4765 2018-10-10 15:44:36 That's a lie, people who make wealth from oil, and other resources will never ever let this happen , and free for everyone haha you live in the wrong society mate, in a capitalist world, nothing goes for free, and never will.
4766 2018-10-10 15:44:36 We do not need to borrow them as the price of oil was enof for us to even save
4767 2018-10-10 15:44:12 “Trump called it "great for our farmers,"

But the oil industry, some environmentalists and other trade groups, like those representing chain restaurants, weren't on board. Some appeared to threaten legal action to challenge the eventual rules...” (E15)
<Politico>
4768 2018-10-10 15:44:12 Yes but be careful with this bc my friend got bronchitis bc her oil had a cooling property and cooled her lungs too much.
4769 2018-10-10 15:44:08 Y’all better do your research and stop using canola oil. You’re not sick, you’re being poisoned.
4770 2018-10-10 15:44:06 My essential oil diffuser just came in the mail, we’re on a whole different energy now ladies and gentlemen

4772 2018-10-10 15:44:05 When oil spills, it sticks around. When LNG leaks, it just evaporates into the air.
4773 2018-10-10 15:43:55 Olive oil spill
4774 2018-10-10 15:43:48 Ça fait plaisir. Car on ne me remercie que très rarement de jouer le rôle de Cassandre (qui avait raison pour la chute de Troie), en annonciateur de très mauvaise nouvelle tel que le peak oil conventionnel. 
Je ne vois pas pourquoi 
4775 2018-10-10 15:43:42 There are only five viable ways of powering civilisation, coal,oil,gas,hydroelectric,nuclear. Everything else is vastly inferior. Solar is important on satellites but grid scale it’s terrible.
4776 2018-10-10 15:43:38 OMG what rock have you been living under. Pruitt was a disaster and finally "resigned" under pressure from people who actually care about our environment. Oh yeah, how about the present administration overturn regulation of oil companies digging offshore.
4777 2018-10-10 15:43:34 Easier ways to make money drilling in new unrestricted locations, like parks and reserved land, have nothing to do with it of course. Neither does the recommendation from banking institutions to consolidate small o&g investors to reduce costs of oil sands. Nothing at all.
4778 2018-10-10 15:43:32 So...  we are just that: a market for arms and oil via rosneft's network(called nayara/essar oil) and a source of investment in your oilfields?
4779 2018-10-10 15:43:27 Cruz is too busy rolling back regulations and negatively affecting climate change so his oil and gas donors can get rich.
4780 2018-10-10 15:43:17 A pipeline exploded in BC. Except it was natural gas, not oil, and so yeah that's a problem but it's a problem that can be fixed without decades of ecological repercussions.
4781 2018-10-10 15:43:14 Moisturizer dia oil base ke? Tak boleh pakai oil based. Nnt breakout.

4783 2018-10-10 15:43:09 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4784 2018-10-10 15:43:09 Lowkey I’m regretting waiting so long for the oil change cause this repair should’ve been done months ago apparently 
4785 2018-10-10 15:43:03 Dow Jones average down 400 points on interest rate increases, inflation fears, and oil price increase.
4786 2018-10-10 15:42:56 Juat?
4787 2018-10-10 15:42:48 They have already gotten away with this. What are we going to do? Stop buying their oil?
4788 2018-10-10 15:42:48 saw this post about how the epa is allowing all this chemical waste to be dumped in the gulf of mexico, and the guy who shared it said “and we’ll be the #1 producer of oil next year!” but like what’s the point in producing oil to make money on a planet that you’re destroying?
4789 2018-10-10 15:42:44 I for myself prefer to be pragmatic. Burning oil (products) is fine, as long you filter toxic gas. 
It’s byproduct CO2 on the other side is neither toxic nore relevant to climate. But it’s good for plants.
4790 2018-10-10 15:42:34 Norway doubled its carbon tax and is sitting on a Trillion $$$ oil fund. Smart!

We could continue to use the pound if We so wish!
£15B debt? fine.
(Its better than the £2 TRILLION debt of the rUK!)
Oil & gas reserves are a bonus, but the money from it would help build our renewables industry!
4808 2018-10-10 15:40:51 People pray for cake. Then God gives them batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
4809 2018-10-10 15:40:49 Maybe if we didnt let the oil&gas companies have so much political power we would have been able to invest in different energy technologies and not do business with murdering dictators. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and energy efficiency. Electric cars. Public transit.

4823 2018-10-10 15:40:22 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
4824 2018-10-10 15:40:22 Consider the fact we are buying oil at world price from a Saudi hitman and Venezuela a country that has no controls and is destroying itself and its environment. Build energy east and get rid of the oil that causes the real damage. Can.environmentalists need to get real.

4829 2018-10-10 15:39:52 The oil and gas industry has a way of coming up with language that makes these things sound great for ordinary people. It’s not.
4830 2018-10-10 15:39:48 You gotta have a good trim.  Shape it right.  Don't forget the beard oil.  Very important.
4831 2018-10-10 15:39:38 We don't need to find alternatives to the planet. We found alternatives to whale oil, and coal, and old farming style, and other things here on earth. We just find what's already here and use it in ways we never thought of before. Let me read the doughnut and I'll get back to you

4834 2018-10-10 15:38:57 Grapeseed oil!!
4835 2018-10-10 15:38:43 En Venezuela votaron por un militar cuando terminó la memoria de Perez Jimenez. En EUA votaron por Trump cuando murieron los ultimos veteranos de la WWII. Es falta de memoria. ¿Qué se nos olvidó para haber votado por AMLO?
4836 2018-10-10 15:38:36 After I posted the Carter video on oil.
4837 2018-10-10 15:38:36 84 dollar oil change...........
4838 2018-10-10 15:38:34 You get the oil changed in yours? I just get a new one, saves on maintenance.
4839 2018-10-10 15:38:32 I may sound like a conspiracy-theorist, but is it really a coincidence that the consolidation of wealth & power to the top 1% began in earnest right around the same time big oil privately determined the coming effects of climate change? They’ve been “preparing” ever since.
4840 2018-10-10 15:38:19 YES!  We subsidize oil at $500 trillion / year.  We give away 1.8 million free parking spaces in NYC for no good reason.  Higher health insurance to cover car accidents.  Driving should pay its own way.
4841 2018-10-10 15:38:17 It my absolutely favorite oil.  I’d pay double for it!!
4842 2018-10-10 15:38:14 They think somehow the scientists are getting rich by providing the evidence. Because I know so many super rich research scientists.

Oh wait, I was confusing them with literally anyone who works in Oil & Gas. Nvm
4843 2018-10-10 15:38:10 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.

4847 2018-10-10 15:37:28 Oh, GACK! Not bad enough that his daddy will be here to campaign for another repug slimeball.
Perhaps one of the Texas oil wells can provide enough slick for little Donny's hair?
4848 2018-10-10 15:37:22 You have a good day as well, and don't worry about my hands, Martine told me to massage them in warm olive oil and it is working wonderfully! I can speak with you as long or as much as needed! Can't wait to talk!
4849 2018-10-10 15:37:22 But u arent following me? Lol i followed u first
4850 2018-10-10 15:37:19 We will be seeing hurricanes like this everyday if we don't address the climate change. We xould be doing so much more! Get off the oil.
4851 2018-10-10 15:37:16 10/10 & today we see a drop in  the Dow Jones the price of  Oil dips & even Google, Twitter & #XRP aren’t spared, is this the beginning of the end, who’s next  & who or what will the Phoenix decide worthy enough to pluck from the embers @LeeR912 @RippleXrpie @Ripple_Me_This
4852 2018-10-10 15:37:03 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.

4854 2018-10-10 15:36:59 Maybe I am buying g the hype,but we are paying you guys in roubles for arms and oil. This is open sanctions-busting by a key US ally. The volume of money is huge tbh. More arme contracts are coming in the indo-Russian summit this December.
4855 2018-10-10 15:36:57 But Oil supplies were falling in The North Sea in 2014 and the price was falling too  so SNP could not rely on revenues as part of economic plan  to justify Independence ? Now why would England want to hold on to some barren old fishing waters  today ?  You people are so obvious
4856 2018-10-10 15:36:53 Also use oil on your hands before you cut. Acts as a barrier between your skin and the pepper
4857 2018-10-10 15:36:41 Oil drops 2% on IMF global outlook growth downgrade
4858 2018-10-10 15:36:40 Don’t forget we will be battling this concept too. “Analysts say drivers should expect gas prices to drop less than they usually do in the Fall, as looming U.S. sanctions on Iran boost the cost of oil.”
4859 2018-10-10 15:36:40 Always remember the three r's. Reduce. Reuse. Ruin oil, gas, and electrical monopolies that destroy the planet #UNClimateReport
4860 2018-10-10 15:36:39 Study 19:19 And a pillar - That is, a memorial to God. Thus Jacob set up the stone on which he had lain ‘for a pillar,’ and poured oil on it Gen_28:18. Again Gen_35:14, he set up a pillar to mark the place where God met him and talked with him (compare Gen_31:13; Lev_26:1;(a)
4861 2018-10-10 15:36:39 It's a clear bell whose tell it is. That oil was purchased at the request for the spirit I had daily contact with in August. This deck is his preferred. The smell recalled the card I associate with him. The only thing missing is his snarky greeting. I'll "ring" him later.
4862 2018-10-10 15:36:32 I have found my permanent oil change spot. Mans took care of me forsure. Best part, didn’t try to plug me with all these different things I “needed” done  #Take5

4867 2018-10-10 15:36:18 I love beets. I boil them in salted water till a fork slides freely, while hot rub off the outer skin, and more salt - I often eat one while I am preparing them! Also a little oil and balsamic vinegar with diced celery makes a wonderful side dish. They are sweet to eat!
4868 2018-10-10 15:36:13 Because those "up there" did everything & everyone they could to get there. Sold their souls, lost their moral compass to get to the money & off the "frontline". Many are just snake oil sellers.
They cannot comprehend the honest, hardworking majority.
It's a tragedy.
4869 2018-10-10 15:36:11 This is horrific.  The US must sanction Saudi Arabia for this barbaric behavior.  One more reason alternative energy sources. No need for oil will bankrupt those disgusting and backward regimes and our government would not have to play nice with them.

4873 2018-10-10 15:35:56 Exactly! Makes a nice substitute for butter or oil.
4874 2018-10-10 15:35:43 Why not just eat the whole fish in stead of just the oil?
4875 2018-10-10 15:35:36 まじかよー
4876 2018-10-10 15:35:35 I saw a man eating puff puff washed his hands insted of rubbing d oil on his head. we are gradualy loosing our culture ..ooh
4877 2018-10-10 15:35:29 Honestly read research from real sources. The debate about the truth of climate change has been over since the 70s. It's political will in the way. Look at what's happening around the globe. Don't be fooled by big oil interests. They've known for decades
4878 2018-10-10 15:35:28 Is the DXY down today with oil prices down?

4884 2018-10-10 15:35:09 3. Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente.

4. Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a medium frying pan (this will add fantastic flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of oil instead), then place over a medium-high heat.

4887 2018-10-10 15:35:06 "one of the more misleading ad campaigns I can remember" please apply that same thesis to a column on I-1631 which is a gas tax and home heating oil tax.
4888 2018-10-10 15:34:54 @abrowntable hey, just got Season today and it looks amazing. One question: for the mostarda, you suggest to use either olive or mustard oil. As this will end up in two completely different versions depending on the oil, which one do you recommend?
4889 2018-10-10 15:34:52 @RahulGandhi: When u say modi is a chor how he paid UPA period crude oil 2 lakhs crores of loan with interest? What ur government did with money & y so much loan ur government did? Now say who is a looter?

Answer Now. 

We people will not allow u to win 2019 election for sure.

4894 2018-10-10 15:34:26 I’m finally working on a self portrait in oil, let’s see how this goes LOLZ
4895 2018-10-10 15:34:16 Support wind energy not oil and gas.
4896 2018-10-10 15:34:06 I really do not get WHY would the Government ever weaken the EPA apart from giving them more ability to POLLUTE IT with Industries like Oil and Coal which Harm Life and Put Money over People and Earth. We need a Government that will increase EPA standards not eliminate them !
4897 2018-10-10 15:34:05 Saturday nighte: a stubborn zit! Dab it with tea tree oil and it'll be gone in no time.
4898 2018-10-10 15:34:02 Yes hahahah
4899 2018-10-10 15:34:00 ...to support fossil fuels over a century ago, we CAN accomplish a renewable future. We’d be naive to pretend the oil and gas industries’ motives are rooted in anything other than profitability here.
4900 2018-10-10 15:33:50 hi i finally called and scheduled an oil change after like 6,000 miles maybe someday I’ll become a responsible adult but today is not that day
4901 2018-10-10 15:33:47 #BoycottFortuneFoods 
Would need oil for festive preparations. Boycott this product, swear not to procure them ever in your life.

あの時は私長編声劇の存在すら知らなくて活動予定が替え歌メインでしたからね…笑
4903 2018-10-10 15:33:34 We ALL know "fossil fuels" is misnomer! Oil in ground is chemicals in earth, heated but core, pushed up thru layers of earth's crust.
4904 2018-10-10 15:33:16 That’s convenient. I’m still rocking the coconut oil out here. And I been using olive oil more and more too
4905 2018-10-10 15:33:09 Not completely. “Analysts say drivers should expect gas prices to drop less than they usually do in the Fall, as looming U.S. sanctions on Iran boost the cost of oil.”

4910 2018-10-10 15:32:40 What is happening with the  US market and oil futures in the red zone !!! Double digits !!
4911 2018-10-10 15:32:19 Probably an 8. I went in on DO my first playthrough, and I didn’t die very often. The combat is very hard though. And there are huge stretches later on like Cenote and the oil field that don’t have campfires with huge platforming sections to get out.
4912 2018-10-10 15:32:10 Recession is wen the economy is not growing. The GDP is not growing and a lot of people lose their jobs. Over 10m Nigerians have lost their jobs in this administration, why won't we go into recession. Have u 4gtn PMB campaigned with regulating global oil price? Some pple bliv dat
4913 2018-10-10 15:32:09 Shame on such people who always puts oil on fire. These are the same persons who have put country's prestige at atkake by stoking baseless and unfounded charges and have always sang the songs of the enemy. Such persons do not have any space in our hearts.
4914 2018-10-10 15:32:03 Meaning what? That renewables don’t solve for the other, non-electricity products to which oil and gas contribute? Plastics and so on? If so, there are alternatives to those as well. The fundamental fact of this debate are pretty simple: Fossil fuels are finite; any carbon...
4915 2018-10-10 15:32:01 Good God. They couldn’t have given the guy a heads up? Realpolitik and or Oil should not supersede such horrendous actions.
4916 2018-10-10 15:32:00 well I did enjoy my #ukog afternoon of sharesys.
so much potential here and well I had fun !
I do shut up...so off to walk the dog. 
4917 2018-10-10 15:31:56 Once you destroy a country on made up intelligence because the oil will turn a profit. Let pictures of your army torturing people leak, make waterboarding routine and lie about bombing civilians you need a fu***ng apology tour.
4918 2018-10-10 15:31:45 Some more industry diversity would be good. Not just Ag, Oil and Aero
4919 2018-10-10 15:31:44 300 years old, country built on the slaughtered blood of natives, slavery, segregation, the mob runs the country, low wages, police brutality, crumbling infrastructure, outdated laws, horrible second hand education, expensive education, oil prices, electoral college? california
4920 2018-10-10 15:31:38 So,
- stocks are down big
- bonds are down
- oil is down big
i have only one question for you:
why is gold unch??
that's completely unacceptable
4921 2018-10-10 15:31:32 You might want to rethink that idea. “Analysts say drivers should expect gas prices to drop less than they usually do in the Fall, as looming U.S. sanctions on Iran boost the cost of oil.”
4922 2018-10-10 15:31:31 When you say you're prepared to license this product, do you mean the worm, or the sex oil for butt stuff?

Me: well as an annoying person on keto would you like chocolates made out of it 

Friend: AHHHHHH
4946 2018-10-10 15:29:57 A commodities trader would answer this way: oil is a security when it's traded on the future's market and it becomes a commodity when it hits the refinery
Similarly, the theory is, when there's a liquid market of real users, a token would be a commodity too.
4947 2018-10-10 15:29:48 आज अमेरिका की धमकी ने काम किया Saudi Arab तैयार हो हुआ crude oil का production बढ़ाने के लिए। इसका मतलब यही है कि #Congress ये चाहती है की crude oil का दाम बढ़ता जाए और @narendramodi ji सरकार को बदनाम कर दें।
4948 2018-10-10 15:29:46 What part of the Wikipedia article is untrue, then? Even oil companies are agreeing (finally) that man-made climate change is real, so your views are fining fewer adherents. Again, could you please provide a list of your "experts"? I can't find them on your web page.
4949 2018-10-10 15:29:44 I think they might have used excess or maybe in the incorrect order your supposed to use oil. It should always be last in your routine. BUT YES I USED IT AND ITS AWESOME! No problem boo!
4950 2018-10-10 15:29:36 & 3 to 6 drops of lemon oil. The oil comes from the peel so has different properties than the juice. You can use a tea instead of water.
4951 2018-10-10 15:29:35 It kept me up last night. I’m going to eat a lot today and if I feel up to it, work out to sweat it out a bit. Eucalyptus oil bath would probably help too. I hate feeling like this!!
4952 2018-10-10 15:29:19 @MiftahIsmail you people were lucky that oil prices remained in range bound ($28 to 55) yet you people jacked up taxes to meet revenue short fall rather than taking policy decisions. Situation would have much worsen had Oil prices not gone down in your tenor.
4953 2018-10-10 15:29:16 It's time to say to hell with Saudi Arabia-another country with a Putin clone on the rise. Kashoggi is proof that Salman is just another hitman ala Putin. We can't really hurt them but we could build energy east pipeline and at least stop importing their oil.
4954 2018-10-10 15:29:13 This is "true" only when you only count private costs, not externality costs. The social cost of fossil fuels far exceeds that of alternatives now, virtually everywhere. Muller et al. concluded in 2011 that oil and coal fired electricity delivered negative value added" to US.
4955 2018-10-10 15:29:10 Yup. Turned over the oil fields & billions in roads and infrastructure built up over 12 years.

4962 2018-10-10 15:28:43 Saudis supply a lot of oil to world. OPEC is powerful. Saudis & Gulf states buy many commercial & military airplanes & equipment from US. US supports Saudis in Yemen genocide. Saudis support US, UK & Israel in Middle East conflicts. What would US & UK do to punish Saudis?
4963 2018-10-10 15:28:43 And a tablespoon of coconut oil.

4965 2018-10-10 15:28:30 Crazy how we are still heavily reliant on oil revenues
4966 2018-10-10 15:28:13 Minister I listened to you in horror this morning on the CBC Early Edition from Vancouver trying to justify sending LNG & Tar Sands Oil to China & this in the light of this damming report - You still say we can export more & more fossil fuel & make these new targets That's a Lie!
4967 2018-10-10 15:28:02 เราเดมหาไม่ได้ เดมมาหน่อยค่ะ
4968 2018-10-10 15:28:02 @realDonaldTrump's trade war-like policies, are really benefiting Nigeria via our oil sector.Oil could soar to $100 as US shuts Iran out of the market. CBN sees oil price not falling below $80 this year & expects to keep monetary policy tight until inflation returns to its target
4969 2018-10-10 15:28:00 Every snake oil con demands your money or liberty on the basis of an untested hypothesis that "needs to be fixed urgently and we dont have time to prove it". Faith is not science.
4970 2018-10-10 15:27:47 Oil companies do also that you support

4972 2018-10-10 15:27:44 Why are taxpayers paying for hurricane damage and flooding caused by climate disruption caused by burning oil and gas #Exxonknew
4973 2018-10-10 15:27:43 Oil companies mad.

4977 2018-10-10 15:27:22 Because a couple thousand barrels of oil is going to make a difference when it comes to war compared to the immediate impact it will have on our environment. Yes on G.
4978 2018-10-10 15:26:57 I think they also don't want people to misunderstand them and assume they're saying you can replace toothpaste and whatever with oil pulling.
4979 2018-10-10 15:26:48 NATGAS 1H testing 3.28 support. Wicks have NOT pierced below yet. WATCH DGAZ.

4980 2018-10-10 15:26:24 That’s because they didn’t do anything wrong. Stopping oil companies from destroying the planet is not a crime. The valve turners are heroes.
4981 2018-10-10 15:26:22 Michael shuts nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output #US | #RTGNews
4982 2018-10-10 15:26:00 Yes we are mono economy but will figures from nairametrics, our non oil export was higher than what we have now.u can't compare Akinwunmi Adeshina achievements as minister of agriculture to that of Audu ogbeh.that was how we are able to achieve escaping recession then.
4983 2018-10-10 15:25:47 when this hits the gas prices at the pumps will go up because of greed of the government just because they closing down the oil wells greed to stay super rich
4984 2018-10-10 15:25:46 My colleague Rep Larry Larranaga from Alb passed away last night. He was honest, worked hard, cared about people, & did great budget work; including a bi-partisan bill raising reserves to balance yo-yo oil & gas prices. He was a good, honorable public servant and will be missed.
4985 2018-10-10 15:25:45 Need some oregano oil
4986 2018-10-10 15:25:41 Speaking of holistic, what about our neighboring states that depend on CO for energy supply (oil & nat gas)?  #Prop112 supporters seem to (conveniently at best, selfishly at worst) forget that electricity supply is just a portion of primary energy consumption for our society.
4987 2018-10-10 15:25:38 eg:
If you own a car and want to keep driving it, you ought to change the oil regularly.
If you have a lease and want an upgrade, you ought not change the oil, so it breaks sooner and you might get a new one.

The the latter might conflict with your goals of being honest though.
4988 2018-10-10 15:25:30 @TomiLahren KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK< WE HERE IN THE WEST TEXAS OIL PATCH SUPPORT YOU 200% !!!!!!
4989 2018-10-10 15:25:29 She's been tainted from the git. Her husband is a lobbyist with ties to Russian oil and GOP love affair with all things Putin!!
4990 2018-10-10 15:25:28 Yes! I’m wondering why you said your dentist doesn’t recommend it, I’ve never found anything stating negative effects of oil pulling./ my paranoia says they don’t want you to practice natural health 
4991 2018-10-10 15:25:26 Vast oil-reserves in the Niger-Delta were discovered in the 1950s, at the end of colonial times, and to this very day contribute to most of the oil wealth of Nigeria.
4992 2018-10-10 15:25:19 Check the candidates records and see how much money they get from the oil industry. Might be too late in some cases because the primaries came and went. Vote earlier in the process if you really want a say.
4993 2018-10-10 15:25:15 @MiftahIsmail don't be so naive. Well head Gas prices are linked go international oil prices. With the surge in oil prices they are bound go up. PML didn't increase gas prices just for the poligical gain resultantly we have revne short fall of both Sui's.
4994 2018-10-10 15:25:12 Lol we didn't suffer this
4995 2018-10-10 15:25:09 Where is the model that illustrates what #akleg budget would look like if we were getting our fair share of oil revenue? Oil back at $80. Where is the discussion about SB21? #akelect candidates all pretend oil revenue not enough-They think we have amnesia  or are all just stupid?
4996 2018-10-10 15:25:08 *pours coconut oil over my life*
4997 2018-10-10 15:25:07 But our oil is / was already cheap... it’s the government taxes that are the problem..... in layman’s terms!
4998 2018-10-10 15:25:07 ...toward a more comprehensive approach. Hopefully, with oil and gas production being limited, we can finally turn to investing in the infrastructure upgrades and the like which are a necessary part of a renewable future. Again, more jobs 
4999 2018-10-10 15:25:05 I have an oil change appointment today!
5000 2018-10-10 15:25:01 Yes would ban future fracking and oil refineries from being built. No would allow those to be build. Yes for the environment. Vote Yes on measure G.
5001 2018-10-10 15:24:45 The European currencies EURO, STERLING were gaining Today, EUR/USD has returned back above 1.15. CRUDE OIL has dropped back to 73.20 USD per barrel.

Thanks to all of them. Having these games on the radio gives our Tigers exposure.
5005 2018-10-10 15:24:26 Gasp! How am I supposed to rehabilitate my warmongering persona to the country by painting crappy tributes of the Americans I duped into dying for oil now?!
5006 2018-10-10 15:24:22 I was surprised coz I paid for the first 5k kilometre change oil plus labour for my Jeep Compass..as a car dealer they should give free service even just the labour since it still under warranty like other car dealer do. So where is my free service warranty?
5007 2018-10-10 15:24:21 Hello Efficascent Oil my old friend
5008 2018-10-10 15:24:21 Or Thatcher selling off everything in sight and squandering north sea oil revenue in a grubby attempt to cling to power - see Norway's Trillion Dollar sovereign wealth funds for an example of what should have been done.

5016 2018-10-10 15:23:48 It's basically putting coconut oil (or other oils) in your mouth and swashing it around for like 15 minutes. The theory is that you're milking the toxins out of your mouth through the process. I find that it just holds onto the gunk and bacteria so cleaning is easier lol.
5017 2018-10-10 15:23:15 Ummm orange poptart has done nothing except go golfing. His puppets do everything in the background. He is just a snake oil salesman.  And rest assured I do not agree with anything his so called administration has done. Thank Obama for the progress since 2009. Magat morons!
5018 2018-10-10 15:23:12 Oil prices changed again?!! why are we paying for a formula that was never revealed to the public? #lka #FuelPriceHike
5019 2018-10-10 15:23:06 We don't need their oil, we need them as mercenaries in Middle East and Africa. I thought you knew that.

5022 2018-10-10 15:22:58 For a group so interested in making money, you’d think they’d try capitalizing (capitalism, get it!!) on new technologies to help combat climate change. But I guess you can’t teach old boys new ways of making money unless it involves oil.
5023 2018-10-10 15:22:49 Land grabbing and oil grabbing.....theft basically?

5044 2018-10-10 15:21:04 Lots of buzz re $1M @exxonmobil contribution to carbon pricing initiative (that, incidentally, would remove any potential legal liability for $XOM re climate damages). For comparison, in 2008 and 2009, they spent *over $50M* defending oil subsidies and against cap and trade.
5045 2018-10-10 15:21:03 Is that a fucking reskin of the shell oil company logo
5046 2018-10-10 15:21:01 You’re all late to the party.  Ever since oil has been king everyone including you, have  had a blind eye to Saudi abuses.
5047 2018-10-10 15:20:58 Awesome stuff! Thanks.

My dad was a geologist. One of his tools was NASA photography that revealed methane rings in Central Texas as clues for where to drill oil wells.
5048 2018-10-10 15:20:52 Growing up we used baking soda and peroxide my dad made sure we didn’t swallow it  
What’s oil pulling tho ?
5049 2018-10-10 15:20:31 More than 350 arrest have been done. Gujrat pulice has brought the situation under control very actively. But what opposition is doing? Only throwing the oil in the fire just to gain political milage. This is very irresponsible of the opposition.

5054 2018-10-10 15:20:13 Your interest in this has nothing to do with Venezuelas oil reserves, right? Just making sure. Have you condemned the Saudi regime for their blatant murder of a journalist yet?
5055 2018-10-10 15:20:11 Cause I can tell you for sure it is not an expression of love. Why must it turn so ugly everytime we argue? And you don’t see that I am not saying more to not add oil to the fire?
5056 2018-10-10 15:20:11 @Gidi_Traffic Gunmen have kidnapped two Nigerian Agip Oil Company’s (NAOC’s) workers. They also abducted two persons, along the creeks of Azuzuama in Southern Ijaw  LGA of Bayelsa State. The victims were in the  area last weekend to carry out a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV)

5066 2018-10-10 15:19:18 And how much coal generated electricity is needed to pump oil to refineries, refine the oil into gasoline, then pump it into into gas tanks? The grid gets greener every day, oil does not.

5073 2018-10-10 15:18:57 Isnt that sign a tribute to big oil and Isn’t lighting that sign every night killing the planet?
5074 2018-10-10 15:18:48 Sarah better have gotten her oil changed bc I promised her mom that I would make sure she did that and I can’t break my promise to her mom. That’ll break my heart and hers.
5075 2018-10-10 15:18:44 I find oil pulling with coconut oil, then flossing & brushing my teeth with baking soda is a good alternative to toothpaste. That’s my routine. It doesn’t taste the best but 
5076 2018-10-10 15:18:40 Also, the only victim of a low carbon tax is coal. A BC-style carbon tax would boost Exxon's natural gas business and barely put a dent in their oil business.

(And also, they have invested heavily into carbon capture which needs the tax to be viable.)
5077 2018-10-10 15:18:32 Didn't you just buy an oil pipeline?

5079 2018-10-10 15:18:31 I mean, the history books said we fought to oppose fascism and nazism. But realistically, we probably did it for oil. 

Here substitute oil for whatever material or political benefit the USA actually wanted.

a) probably has sugar or some carb-rich sauce even without the rice 

b) probably fried in vegetable or seed oil (avoid at all costs - it drives inflammation and highly obesogenic)

5091 2018-10-10 15:17:34 So let me ask a serious question. If we are wrong and this is all a hoax what us the worst case scenario? We use greener energy? Eat less meat? End of our fixation on oil which has us tied to some if the worst countries and regions on the planet? Then let me ask this, what if you
5092 2018-10-10 15:17:34 Where are the ads exposing @MikeDunleavyGov voted for SB21 and SB91?  Where are the ads exposing @AkGovBillWalker lies about working for our fair share of oil revenue? Are you part of the problem or the solution @MarkBegich #akleg
5093 2018-10-10 15:17:30 @angusenergyplc let’s get to brockham and get that lovely kimmeridge oil, great results from UKOG on such a small section compared to what we are after. Make sure you have enough storage etc :-)

5096 2018-10-10 15:17:17 Do residents in beautiful Orange County, California really want dingy ugly olive green & brown waters on their shores that will come with off shore oil drilling? Also oil creates heat making Summer breeze unbearable. Vote blue for beauty & vote red for ugly views & hot temps.

5105 2018-10-10 15:16:36 They don't care about the oil spills just as long as the money keeps rolling in!!!!!!
5106 2018-10-10 15:16:29 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
5107 2018-10-10 15:16:25 There are quite a few private ventures working on this, Tokamak Energy looks promising too. It will be cracked by one of them I'm sure. How governments react to these technolgies will be interesting given their vested interests in oil.

5112 2018-10-10 15:16:12 I need a oil change but I’m wayyy to busy 
5113 2018-10-10 15:16:11 Snake oil has been around a helluva lot longer than 10 years.
5114 2018-10-10 15:16:10 To do my uni homework or create a new oil painting I've literally been daydreaming about all day? ugh why must time be so limited when you have tiny humans? :/ lol goes to create artwork and suddenly it's a new drawing of my son. #wellplayed #motherhoodandcreativity
5115 2018-10-10 15:16:10 @BillOReilly Oh Bill she understood quite well how the oil well works. She just didnt want anyone else to know how it works.  Hillary we get it better than you...that how we know u are a traitorist witch.
5116 2018-10-10 15:16:10 Leave it to the republicans to sell you on clean coal/oil and remove one of the most important catalysts for change to clean(er) power vehicles. Reminds me of the Superman Krypton origin story.  Err..No the planets gonna be fine, don’t worry about a thing...
5117 2018-10-10 15:16:10 I got Papa using my soap, Michelle’s burning sandalwood incense and buying essential oil body mist - I’m changing them just by living in the house
5118 2018-10-10 15:16:02 It's amazing how many "pro-environment" people refuse to support something that could reasonably, within a decade or two, put a complete end to coal, oil, and gas power plants.
5119 2018-10-10 15:15:58 How is this possible all that water and fucker runs into an oil tanker.never going to clean this update
5120 2018-10-10 15:15:56 If tesla keeps growing the tesla effect will become bigger. Oil industry won't be very happy. As far as I am concerned the world can switch over to electric cars, our planet will be very happy with that.
5121 2018-10-10 15:15:54 Can you say "Snake Oil"
5122 2018-10-10 15:15:34 Anyway that’s all really, the teams famous over here are Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Tottenham who’ve not just sprung up because of Arab oil money, you’ll never shake that link I’m sorry to say
5123 2018-10-10 15:15:33 Little Donny was gonna tell Brookie to hold his beer but he doesn’t like beer.
5124 2018-10-10 15:15:24 Can you imagine saying, “I’ll just let someone else decide wether I live or die”?
That’s what it’s like to not vote. If you don’t vote out politicians who are funded by oil companies then we are on a crash course, all of us. Don’t wait for someone to make the choice for you.

5126 2018-10-10 15:15:10 My parents decided it was the perfect time to get an oil change. lmao

5130 2018-10-10 15:15:00 WTI trading chatroom update #OOTT : Early morning attendees in the room traded off the Vitol and BP oil price convos reported by Mr. Blas. Convos are polite and erudite. Just like before the waiter at Tony's brings the check to a table of Williams & Energy Transfer gas traders.
5131 2018-10-10 15:14:55 To recap. Saudi Arabia attacked (or parts of their government helped Bin Laden) us on 9/11 (see the redacted pages). They routinely torture and behead people. And they are rabid zealots, but our friends because of oil.

And @tomfriedman thinks, well at least they're trying?

5142 2018-10-10 15:14:24 You need to understand figurative vs literal speaking. The term "burn it down" doesn't mean to kill everyone. I can be critical of a regime 1000s of miles away. How do you think African apartheid ended? Or Slobodan Milosevic? The UN/US tolerate Saudi cause of their oil only.

5144 2018-10-10 15:14:03 Or, use the dollar store  canola/olive oil blend that has the words OLIVE OIL in larger type to fool you despite being only 5% questionably olive. You'll get a richer flavor profile in a placebo form. Or... so I hear.
5145 2018-10-10 15:13:52 most of the oil rigs in the path of the storm have been evacuated but about 40% of the US oil output in the Gulf is shut down. Also the LOOP (only export terminal in the US that can load up the largest oil tankers is closed)

5154 2018-10-10 15:13:18 Or another way to describe a fiscal transfer is: Since 2010 Norway has raised £148 bn in oil tax revenues, the UK £38 bn. So you could say the UK has fiscally transferred around £13 bn a year in lost revenue to the oil companies.
5155 2018-10-10 15:13:02 Why did you vote to give our oil revenue away with SB21 and vote to make Alaska less safe with SB91?  Are you assuming that Alaskans have amnesia or are just stupid?  This candidacy is an insult to thinking Alaskans #akleg

5158 2018-10-10 15:12:55 World's top traders divided on oil outlook as Iran sanctions loom :
    * Trafigura CEO: no surprise if oil above $100 next year
    * Glencore sees mid-term oil price at $85-90
    * Vitol chairman sees oil at $65 next year, Gunvor $70-75
5159 2018-10-10 15:12:53 I need an oil change 
5160 2018-10-10 15:12:46 what is it that America and Saudi have in common? money or oil please the US should tell the world why they can't sanction Saudi Arabia terrorist America always claim to be the human right fighter but yet they always turn their blind eye against evil

5193 2018-10-10 15:10:24 SA uses water to push oil out of the ground since its fields are 60+years old & past peak production. Water cuts are more than 50% of what is being pumped out now.

5213 2018-10-10 15:08:06 Don't know if I want to see the answer.  The "good thing" is that it isn't just Canada today but oil stocks in general.
5214 2018-10-10 15:07:46 Also multiply the daily oil revenue by a factor (say 1.2) to cater for other revenues sources before compounding . Since oil only caters for about 80%.
5215 2018-10-10 15:07:43 Eating less oil and coal also helps :)

2018 rupee=74, interest rate= 8.5%,inflation = 4.5%,oil=85
5235 2018-10-10 15:06:04 But with “leftists” agreeing with the canard that oil is “essential” to Canada, it’s hard to get a groundswell of climate defense
5236 2018-10-10 15:05:56 @great_oil well worth a read on Rapeseed and Canola oil in particular.  I try my very hardest not to eat either and also palm oil for a very different reason. Extra Virgin  Olive oil is the very best for me!
5237 2018-10-10 15:05:47 This is the same as thoughts and prayers after a mass shooting because you sit idly by and do nothing except allow our planet to be raped by big oil and roll back Obama protections, taking no action to protect our planet.

Climate change is real, do something or shut up.
5238 2018-10-10 15:05:36 No strategy either, for that matter..GWOT is essentially us fighting an oil fire with water!!!
5239 2018-10-10 15:05:25 Deut 18:22 #AnInconvenientTruth wasn't "in the name of the LORD" but its predictions are coming true; historic hurricane hitting FL panhandle latest example. @GOP oil lobbyists & flunkies who said it would never happen #lie then, now say "we don't know what's causing;" they do.

Super Diesel increased by Rs 8 (Rs 141)
5242 2018-10-10 15:05:15 And you wonder why those that believe in the MOST HIGH loves LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM?. "Death penalty is human rights" but the GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas is not. Go figure!.
5243 2018-10-10 15:05:14 Hemp seed oil doesn’t work because it has no CBD. There are groups about CBD on FB, which help with information.  I’ve been experimenting with the many ways to use CBD for 4 months. It isn’t a magic bullet but it helps.

5254 2018-10-10 15:04:34 a country the size of CANADA, with three oceans boarding it, has only one oil refinery, We have the second largest know oil reserves , in the world next to SAUDI ARAIA , you think , we would have more refineries.

5275 2018-10-10 15:01:48 #AANLM I don’t follow “not helping them”? Our economy is booming which helps everybody. Families working coal, oil, farming, auto, etc. Record-breaking low unemployment, 4.2 GDP, are all benefitting Americans. We’ve stopped sponsoring terrorism (pallets cash Iran Deal) etc.
5276 2018-10-10 15:01:47 El gas muchas veces tiene fuel oil inyectado, por lo que el medidor corre. No hay forma de perrear la electricidad. Yo me estoy pasando a todo electrico. Inclusive la calefaccion. El dia de mañana que pueda llevar a la red va a ser mas economico.
5277 2018-10-10 15:01:46 Naira value compare with dollar is not about fuel price alone but our foreign reserve,  rate of exportation  compare to importation. The fuel price will only enhance our income line to cater for budget deficit as our major source of income or revenue is oil. Stand to be corrected
5278 2018-10-10 15:01:44 Until Americans actually start using less oil, shutting down new drilling in CO will only make those kinds of spills MORE likely. The oil has to come from somewhere and if it's not the US, it's coming from overseas.

5292 2018-10-10 15:00:29 Because scientists (and business people and humans in general) never have overly pessimistic models.

Headline from a 1970s article on (human created) oil shortages--"We are all going to freeze to death...in the dark."
5293 2018-10-10 15:00:26 @KristySwansonXO if you could lobby Trump to take essential goods off the speculation market this would lower oil costs , and get our gas back down to the 2.00 a gallon price , it used to be this way years ago as a national security issue, everyone has to have these goods
5294 2018-10-10 15:00:25 Aye..that's life. England will not keep ALL the Oil fields. You do not even produce enough energy & water..it has to be subsidised by Scotland! What can't we do without you? NOTHING!  We can do everything for ourselves. Also no lords & ladies will be subsidise in by our country!

5302 2018-10-10 14:59:42 Sad testament to a weak willed, sold out UK bureaucracy that puts economic ties to the saudi’s and Middle east ahead of Democratic principles in the UK. Oil dollars create syncophants. What next? Govt Ministers in Burkhas? Ridiculous Nonsense

5304 2018-10-10 14:59:35 In any case right now we are burning fossil fuel by tons, be it coal or oil, because clean tech is still growing and not there yet. If we have to burn fossil fuel, might as well burn what we have than to import is my point.
5305 2018-10-10 14:59:19 So snakes don’t like brake fluid/cooking oil ?
5306 2018-10-10 14:59:09 Old news

We have much more energy independence.  We have all the oil we need. 

It's more about world stability now. And offering people the same freedoms we enjoy is not a bad thing to those nations who want it
5307 2018-10-10 14:58:57 The debate is very poor, they don’t care about any fiscal system. Some just think it unlimited oil money or print Naira

5311 2018-10-10 14:58:44 They never had a moral compass to lose. They have always been snake oil salesmen. Using moral ideology to gain votes and support from vulnerable easily persuaded poor Americans. 

Name 1 policy since Russian Reagan held office that put country or Americans over party?
5312 2018-10-10 14:58:42 So far, CBD (little to no THC) has not helped me. I’ve tried two brands with so many different dosages. (Liquid form.) I’ve, admittedly, not tried the CBD patches. (I have also tried Hemp Seed oil to no avail.) I’ll look into the patches. Thanks for the idea.

5318 2018-10-10 14:58:24 We can wring our hands. Or we can put a price on carbon. Perhaps double the price for wasteful flared gas. Let companies make thoughtful informed decisions on developing plays with both oil and gas.

Another easy one: royalties owed to mineral owner for wasted flared resources.

5321 2018-10-10 14:58:17 We're paying more for fuels while U.S. fossil fuel manufacturers are using U.S. soil to make more oil and gas then they have in many years? Having our resources drained without much benefit except destruction of those lands feels pretty crappy. Feels like we're getting fleeced!
5322 2018-10-10 14:58:15 I need to finish up my laundry, go grocery shopping, and get an oil change today

Definitely a serial killer.
5324 2018-10-10 14:57:58 I mean, I give up pretty easily by nature, but I'm pretty sure the planet was doomed the moment humans figured out you could use oil for fuel... *checks calendar* ... more than 2000 years ago.

Ain't no one stopping technology. We all died that day a couple millennia ago.

For Adnoc, it's 6 oil concessions, $45bn refinery/petchem plan and gas plan.

5373 2018-10-10 14:54:13 I recommend everybody to use wild growth oil if you want your hair to grow out. My hair grew 5 inches in length since I started using it in March & it’s 150% thicker than it was before

5375 2018-10-10 14:54:11 Literally its only positive is its meltability. But when it's mostly oil, you kind of understand why it melts like that.

5380 2018-10-10 14:53:22 Same to the Oil industry. It's time we moved to alternatives. If there aren't alternatives yet, we still need to stop now before it's too late. Alternatives will be developed. Humans have adapted to change throughout our existence. It's time we moved on from fossil fuels.

5396 2018-10-10 14:52:08 hmm lunch is tricky. I am quite often accidentally vegan, but not so much for lunch. however one thing that I've enjoyed recently is noodle soup. You just need miso paste +hot water+ flavour (veg stock, chilli oil, soy sauce, ginger). To be quick you can buy ready cooked noodles.

5421 2018-10-10 14:49:25 A little hope: we have reached a tipping point in the climate debate.  Oil companies are no longer arguing '#climatechange isn't real'.  When the argument ranges from 'invest oil profits in renewables' to 'shut down the oil sands' we have cleared the hurdle of inactivity.
5422 2018-10-10 14:49:23 I mix the Mizani spray with Cantu’s leave-in, go in with almond oil all throughout my hair, then use a generous amount of Cantu’s coconut curling cream (mixed with Shea moisture’s curl enhancing smoothie) on each twist.

Thats why everyone is fighting to enter power in Nigeria. 
They will come back to say youths are lazy, when they are lazy, lazier laziest.

5437 2018-10-10 14:48:49 Chickpea salad can be made up in a very satisfying manner. I like to julienne or brunoise whatever veggies are around into it. Fine with olive oil & aceto, but my current favourite would be to heat up some oil with a bit of curry or Ras el Hanout. Throw in some protein of choice.
5438 2018-10-10 14:48:48 • Treat your skin gently
Hot water and long showers removes oil from your skin. Use warm water rather than hot to shower.
• Eat a healthy diet
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grain and lean proteins. Don't forget to drink more water to keep your skin hydrated

5446 2018-10-10 14:47:55 i just woke up at 7 am to fill my diffusers with oil, I made myself tea and turned on a fan and put lotion on my body.

5461 2018-10-10 14:46:46 Sir it’s you who are not in sync with reality. Over last 4 years we have seen substantial improvement on economic front with India back as fastest growing major economy, inflation <5%. Current oil and currency problem is transient in nature. But minority appeasement continues.
5462 2018-10-10 14:46:45 That it did...and yet, still immigrants get blamed for every ill going by the snake oil merchants, after every grave economic crisis, and then when the snake oil invariably doesn’t get delivered...

History might be boring, but those who forget it <etc>
5463 2018-10-10 14:46:22 @1a -- Amazing to hear the Climate Leadership Council rep say they don't take money from corp'ns but they were founded by 4 major oil cos. and they have opinion leaders ranging from Behrnanke to Yellin to Summers. As if that's an actual range, instead of the same point on a line.

5509 2018-10-10 14:43:41 @smerconish outside of Trumps personal dealings with the Saudis it seems to me him recently asking them to increase oil production combined with a fear that provoking them could result in a reduction just prior to midterms is likely why he isn’t reacting.
5510 2018-10-10 14:43:34 I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?

I convinced my entire 2nd grade class, teacher included, that I was born in Greenland. My mother gave birth to me underwater and my father worked on an oil rig. When classmates asked me to speak Greenland, I would say gibberish.

5529 2018-10-10 14:41:24 With a higher crude oil price in the int'l market relative to the rate used for 2018 budget, why are we still borrowing? With the loots returned by foreign countries in 2018, why are still borrowing? I doubt if this loan is actually for the purpose presented to the @nassnigeria

Sorry, ain't got no time for that.
But I must say, if Femi Otedola is like you, he too would be in politics looking for crumbs and he would never develop Forte Oil.

5603 2018-10-10 14:34:26 I'm very grateful to currently live where medical cannabis oil is legal.  I believe it should be legal and available in every state of the U.S.  I'm from Michigan originally, & it's been sad to see how much false information law enforcement has recently put out in my home state.
5604 2018-10-10 14:34:24 Well i guess that's the problem when a state like Russia take Crimea, parts of Georgia, parts of east Ukraine, etc., other people can claim territory and you look like an idiot talking otherwise, they can act just like you, don't forget, Russia is a big place, China needs oil/gas

5645 2018-10-10 14:30:43 Yeah, I think anything that could be considered seasoning is okay. So an oil or an herb. But anything that is definitely a topping should not be considered: cheese, gravy, cheese, bacon, etc.
5646 2018-10-10 14:30:42 I hate wait during oil changes

5661 2018-10-10 14:29:42 Don’t forget about Venezuela too. What do all these dangerous dictators have in common besides oil? They don’t submit to Western corporate overlords.
5662 2018-10-10 14:29:31 Absolutely... a near-immediate side-effect of Iraq's reliance on oil - going back to the 50's. But that doesn't negate the fact that climate change today is adding to and complicating a longstanding problem.
5663 2018-10-10 14:29:30 Its totally consistent. He is a maximalist and BTC burns more energy in a single day than that entire oil spill

5666 2018-10-10 14:29:20 #JamalKhashoggi ‘s horrifying murder is yet another example of the growing, global movement toward fascism and the way that capitalism — particularly oil greed— fuels it. 

You cannot be simultaneously pro-capitalism and anti-fash.

5675 2018-10-10 14:28:40 Or the bits which are about Gender don't simply start at F3 level. It's a bit like waiting for your car to run out of oil so you can change the whole engine in one go to change the oil. Sort it out earlier and you don't get the problem later.
5676 2018-10-10 14:28:37 I dropped my oil cap down there once. It landed on the inside of my front bumper. That was a fun hour of me trying to jam my hand down there. Finally got to it going through the front wheel well. If that happens again, I’m just going to light my car on fire and walk away.

5678 2018-10-10 14:28:29 Yup. They'll rant about OCare mandate but an ethanol mandate is perfectly fine. Gov't involvement does not justify more gov't involvement.

Always enjoy ethanol groups talking about legislators with oil interests in their districts while ignoring those w/ethanol interests...

5690 2018-10-10 14:27:48 it's interesting how the benchmark for Iran crude oil export has become the unsustainable peak of April/May rather than the average of 2017, which would be a better benchmark for the sanctions impact

5706 2018-10-10 14:26:13 Oil producers will love this. High ethanol gas severely lowers the engines milage efficiency, so you have to fill up more often.
5707 2018-10-10 14:26:10 In both cases tax rates were too low. Compare UK with Norway (they extract from the same oil field). Norway kept tax levels high & socked the windfall away knowing a bust would come (ironically based on AB model). UK & AB cut taxes. Norway's high taxes didn't scare corps away.

I have burned ethanol in small engines for decades, and 0 problems. But I also regularly maintain them, including regular oil changes and gas stabilizer over winter.

5776 2018-10-10 14:20:32 A true test of patience is when your using Tissue Oil for stretch marks,I think it takes as long as they said we should wait for Jesus to come back just to actually fade them away,
5777 2018-10-10 14:20:26 To reduce fuel imports you should dig and extract your own fuel we are not bound to opec so we can price it cheaper .... OIL IS ESSENTIAL !!!
5778 2018-10-10 14:20:20 Promise me it'll be a glue trap, and you will release him with baby oil afterwards, then set him free in a pretty field of flowers with a mouse-sized satchel full of cheese for his journey.

5783 2018-10-10 14:19:57 I think everyone has a pretty good idea what might have happened. That it’s even a possibility is appalling but nothing anyone can do. Yes, let them know, but I guarantee it will do no good. Stop using oil or cut down drastically and that will hurt them

5806 2018-10-10 14:18:29 The best thing to do is stop using oil in Western countries altogether and ship them out to developing countries as a replacement to coal/charcoal

5823 2018-10-10 14:16:16 The press has reported the UN's statement from a scientific study on #climatechange. If people won't believe the science that coal n oil use is affecting our atmosphere n climate, surely I'm not going to blame the press n meteorologists. They do their best to tell us. Doom awaits

I'm talking about the ingredients being all roasted peanuts and a dash of salt, without any hydrogenated oil additives or sugar.

Not only does it tastes like heaven, it's fuckin healthy.
5858 2018-10-10 14:13:54 Basically they link allergies to eczema, saying exposing the skin to peanut oil irratates the eczema producing an allergy. Bottom line, its important that food is introduced orally asap before its introduced via skin contact.

5871 2018-10-10 14:12:38 OIL 1H halts lower again. My "leading indicators" also HALT lower. OIL always "kicks and screams" when going lower, better, smoother when bullish. Taking profit when I see it. This is a "dip up" for now, longer term lower to continue.

5875 2018-10-10 14:12:33 It doesn't use enough as much oil/gas as all those people driving. Repubs all still have oil/gas in their investment portfolios. Koch bros hate rail b/c they're fossil fuel industry

5883 2018-10-10 14:12:06 Why?  Have they stopped pumping oil?  Do we get oil from Iran, China, Russia? Or is this simple price gouging  to  insure big profits to the Oil Industry & OPEC.

5940 2018-10-10 14:06:48 @jimcramer Do you really think the “Powell pullback” will end if he dials back his comments?  It just seems like their are too many factors (oil,tariffs, elections....) to overcome.  Although we’re more than halfway done with the selloff.
5941 2018-10-10 14:06:43 It does look nice, but does it seem like something that would absorb liquid and stain? (thinking like oil or coffee) That'd be a nightmare scenario for a case imo.

5946 2018-10-10 14:06:13 We find oil six miles underground yet insist our strategic oil reserves was for national defense. Result? Fuel crisis. Record oil prices. Saudi billionaires. CIA controlled puppet dictators. A boa constrictor squeezed its prey before it eats.

5954 2018-10-10 14:05:31 Investors shouldn't sell out of oil and gas but use their influence to cut back on burning the stuff and instead push the companies into using oil and gas as a chemical feedstock, develop CCU technologies and support H2 production development.   BP r always behind the times.
5955 2018-10-10 14:05:23 One thing people don't seem to be talking about with Hurricane Michael is all of the spilled oil that is going to get churned up again in the Gulf of Mexico.

They sign on because they know they can jack the price make even more profits and say they are being good environmental stewards. That is the only reason they do it. suckers like you fall for this crap
5978 2018-10-10 14:03:34 I don’t think Donald Trump is evil, I think he is very conscious of his conduct & behavior! Among other things, I think he’s a hater, an opportunist, a carpetbagger & a snake oil demagogue! He’s somebody I do not trust or respect!

5991 2018-10-10 14:02:11 It’s a private bank. A banking cartel in my opinion. A bank that controls interest rates and inflation in this country ever since we got off the gold standard. The reason why our dollar is still worth anything is because Saudi forces all countries to buy their oil with US dollars

6015 2018-10-10 13:59:42 Price of petrol and gas is related to international oil prices. Dollar at 104 means we didnt devalue money and we are seeing impact of it today through trade deficit. Even Mufta Ismail is saying that. What you want to prove here.

6050 2018-10-10 13:56:37 Sir, at the very first moment when engine oil leaked from the tappet cover, I informed TATA service centre that the car is defective and hence should be replaced, but on the contrary they said it's normal and not to worry. Within a week of repair, the belt has given up.
6051 2018-10-10 13:56:37 Isn't it time to sue the oil companies for damages. Ron Paul always said this is the right libertarian solution.
6052 2018-10-10 13:56:35 I must say that it feels amazing to wake up and not have to do anything to my hair but spray water/oil in it and go lol #teambaldheaded #minicurls
6053 2018-10-10 13:56:21 Gee, isn’t that what happened with Iraq, right before 9/11? Started selling cheap oil? Not saying the turn of events I agree with but that is the international equivalent to having dirt on the Clintons: You get suicided.

6069 2018-10-10 13:55:13 The coming winters are going to be brutal. People will wonder why they listened to the global warming nutjobs for so long. The prices of oil, food and gas are going to go through the roof. It didn't have to be that way, they could have prepared for what they knew was coming.

6102 2018-10-10 13:51:34 According to a democrat president the world was also suppose to run out of oil by 2011 if memory serves me right. Remember when Carter went on national television to make that assertion ?

6108 2018-10-10 13:51:09 It would be nice Senator Paul but I'm afraid Senator Corker is busy trying to find a reason for the US to invade Venezuela, yet another country that hasn't done us any harm but just took back control of their own oil.
6109 2018-10-10 13:51:05 Really? Well! "waves hands" hi. Lots of us move out for increased economic opportunities. Fortunately the administration has helped bring our steel and aluminium plants back as well as helped reopen energy in coal, oil. and natural gas.
6110 2018-10-10 13:51:05 Solar is less expensive to pay once installed, but costs $20-$30k out of pocket for a 2000 sq ft home. Amt. of sunlight also matters.

6116 2018-10-10 13:50:13 It was time decades ago. The oil companies have been aware of the problem for at least 40 years, and have put profits first at every turn.
6117 2018-10-10 13:50:10 Beto is the same guy who has written misogynistic articles about women, who has been arrested AND voted to tax $10/barrel on oil in a state where millions of jobs involve energy. For those of us that drive, that’s an extra $0.24/gallon at the pump #votecruz

6136 2018-10-10 13:48:55 Assuming the electricity from EVs come from coal, it's still better than imported oil for the economy. Plus newer generation coal plants are less polluting and over a period of time they can be replaced with either renewable or nuclear.

6189 2018-10-10 13:46:00 I agree with Becca. Peppermint oil will be your best friend! Also if you search on Pinterest there’s a bunch of blends that you can diffuse (if you have a diffuser) that will help!
6190 2018-10-10 13:45:57 Everyday people will lie that Nigeria is not running on a budget depending on oil revenue
6191 2018-10-10 13:45:51 Will it be run by coal and oil? That’s why. Follow the robber barons

6194 2018-10-10 13:45:35 ニコニコという界隈で、「VOCALOID」タグ単独で伸びるのは難しくて、「歌ってみた」と合わせて大きなコンテンツだったように思えるんだけど、このころからニコニコ発クリエイターみたいな動きが出てきて、インフルエンサーたる歌い手たちがVOCALOIDを広める役割を果たさなくなったと分析してる
6195 2018-10-10 13:45:34 Lol.  That's funny.  I put that in the same category as Scientology.  Please explain how you would apply what Norway does, who uses their oil to fund socialist programs on top of 60% tax, has only 5 million people & few immigrants to the US with 400 million people.
6196 2018-10-10 13:45:32 Reminds you of the Saudi teams on 9/11..How much longer do we have to go on with this charade that they're our friends? We're nothing but addicts to their oil and petro dollars...kissing up to the Tangerine Traitor and his bankrupt son in law only adds to the illusion. WAKE UP!
6197 2018-10-10 13:45:31 I have to get my oil flushed out + a change. My breaks are grinding 
6198 2018-10-10 13:45:16 And to the extent Medicare is pretend "paid for" by taxes it's done so by specific taxes collected for that purpose, yes? Which can't keep up with escalating costs that were completely predictable? I literally have no idea what I'm talking about but that's my understanding.

6200 2018-10-10 13:45:13 Can India please have a crude oil futures buying, inventory storage and hedging policy in place ? This avoidable 50% drop in the currency from 50 to 75 vs the USD in the past 10 years is embarrassing.

6210 2018-10-10 13:44:37 .. aparently it's about 100$ for that so I'm looking at like 170$ for a oil change. Well unfortunately I don't know many people that would help me. My brother used to do the work but we had a falling out since that damn Canada trip  and my dad is MIA  go figure

6216 2018-10-10 13:44:27 Hmmm,we are already deep into the same trap
Our oil wells in the Niger Delta must have been used as collateral for the huge loans we are getting from them

6220 2018-10-10 13:44:02 Yet, she’s supportive of the federal government buying a pipeline that, by definition, doesn’t keep oil in the ground.

6223 2018-10-10 13:43:56 I'm sure the Saudi Crown Prince has moved up on Trump's list of most admired world leaders.

We must sanction Saudi Arabia, break diplomatic relations and stop taking oil from them.

6229 2018-10-10 13:43:30 @JustinTrudeau Canada has the right of way for the Kinder Morgan pipeline.  Why not use the space for solar panels or wind turbines instead of a pipeline.  Cut down on oil coming from the oilsands now.  A grande geste.

6244 2018-10-10 13:42:47 Typically chicken farmers don't like RFS because they can't feed chickens high amounts of DDGs, the feed co-product from ethanol.  Have seen anti-RFS from fast food franchise owners, poultry growers, and oil. You see some odd bedfellows on this issue.
6245 2018-10-10 13:42:45 I’ll never go get my oil changed again. Ole buddy asked me to pop my hood and I popped my trunk and both our idiot selves were out here trying to open the hood

6276 2018-10-10 13:40:19 IMF has downgraded the overall global growth forecast for 2018 and 2019 and for that the the oil prices also in a non escalating mood as it lower also. As the Brent crude is now nearly 85 dollar per barrel. but despite of the fact of lowering world oil prices there is a tendency.

6282 2018-10-10 13:40:02 I would agree, once again, consumers will take the brunt. It is going to be a very hard sell this side of the mountains given the amount of fuel and heating oil (colder winters) used. It will take one with more intelligence than me to figure it out.

6299 2018-10-10 13:38:47 But there's still a choice at the pump, that's what I was getting at. The RFS has multiple goals, one of which is reducing need on foreign oil, you're absolutley right. Implementing a renewable source of liquid fuel, improving emissions are goals as well.

Maybe increasing oil production, that ruins the Russian economy. Trump has been harder on Russia than Obama in 8 years
6305 2018-10-10 13:38:21 Read the law, easier to understand and debate. RFS was intended to help curb energy independence, lower fuel prices, create domestic fuel source and jobs. It has done that, despite the efforts of oil companies.

6333 2018-10-10 13:36:25 If you wanted to sell illegal oil skirting Federal Restrictions you'd set up a Corporate Shell in the U.S then that Pricipal would establish a Brokerage Account and used this cross trade Book to quietly transact off floor buy or sell Open Orders.

The real problem is having only one major source of revenue. 
But we have shallow idiots in government. Whom would loot oil money rather than invest in the country just like other serious countries did.

6348 2018-10-10 13:35:28 I'm upset.

I'm seeing headlines with lie after lie come out about Iran's September crude oil exports and production. There doesn't seem to be any self-restraint by the big media networks to carefully examine & verify everything first before spewing it out.

Completely shameful.
6349 2018-10-10 13:35:28 Good job @Adriearsenault! Only CBC reporter worth listening. So think Irving Refinery explosion (no casualties) bit of a " let's get our oil elsewhere " message.
6350 2018-10-10 13:35:21 Just watched a video about how imported extra virgin olive oil can be cut with hazelnut oil (to cut production cost), and the profit being made is comparable to that of drug trafficking.

6358 2018-10-10 13:35:01 Ethanol subsidy ended in 2011, but you are correct on oil. They have 100+ years of various federal support. I was referring to the cost at the pump, that is straightforward. If you are factoring in other issues, ethanol definitely will win every time.
6359 2018-10-10 13:35:01 It would be “the biggest party on earth”, announced the Shah. He wanted to show the world the new face of an ancient empire, a modern and proud Iran, a nation of oil, not of Islamic mullahs.

6369 2018-10-10 13:34:37 Part of me thinks we shouldn't include Lougheed's years in this. He opposed the NEP because the oil royalties would go to Ottawa, leaving a pittance to Albertans.
After he left Getty lowered oil royalties to a pitiful rate. Today the oil companies are doing to Albertans...1

6384 2018-10-10 13:33:25 From the EU perspective, Scotland would be quite a catch.
We would offer all the decent stuff the UK offered, minus the arrogance & backstabbing.
We would be a major player by virtue of oil resources & renewables - same goes for fishing.
We prefer to build bridges, not burn them.
6385 2018-10-10 13:33:16 only pay less if you think about the up front cost, both oil and ethanol industry take massive tax breaks and government incentives on the back end. Trying to figure out actual cost is nearly impossible other than to say it is much higher for both per gallon
6386 2018-10-10 13:33:10 Tesla made oil obsolete 100 yrs ago. Our energy technology has gone nowhere since then.

6398 2018-10-10 13:32:10 Oil companies have deeper pockets but ethanol lobby has electoral advantages for winning Midwest (IMO). Same w steel tariffs vs auto industry: latter has deeper pockets but former can swing some big states w a lot of electoral votes (eg, PA, IL, IN)
6399 2018-10-10 13:32:10 Ever notice how oil CEOs come up with totally impractical suggestions to halt climate change, yet studiously avoid the obvious: stop burning fossil fuels.

6460 2018-10-10 13:26:25 I think that's my point really, it's much more difficult, from a policy solutions perspective, to link EV sales and global oil consumption to Iraq's water crisis than it is to link regional dam building projects and irrigation systems etc.

6468 2018-10-10 13:25:46 That one on the pensions may have been closer to the truth. The oil economy tanked post 2014 and the English aren’t very good at honouring their financial obligations.

6498 2018-10-10 13:23:26 I’d argue it was price and not quality. Eagle Ford got up to half a million of 50+ API oil and the decline started when oil prices fell. I’m not sure that is evidence of a problem finding a market. There were no exports allowed at that time as well

6538 2018-10-10 13:20:04 LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest trading houses said on Wednesday they saw oil prices not falling below $65 per barrel and possibly breaking above $100 next year due to U.S. sanctions on Iran.
6539 2018-10-10 13:20:00 Very well written Oil summary, IMO. been expecting oil prices to rise in 2nd 1/2 2018. Looks like White House will hold off big price increases till after elections.

6586 2018-10-10 13:16:10 There are very specific limitations towards figuring out alternative methods and they are already known. The trick is mass producing them cost effectively. The alternate to oil would be electric or hydrogen/hybrid, however using current tech requires too many rare earth metals.

6601 2018-10-10 13:15:01 Likely because of the greed in oil. They are ramping up oil exports instead of lowering fuel prices, all along continuing to import large quantities of oil. They want to make the most while they can, and consumers pay the price.

6610 2018-10-10 13:14:08 According to the sources World's biggest oil exporter saudi Arabia is going to increase crude oil supply by 4 million barrels for Indian buyers in November. #Saudi #crudeoil
6611 2018-10-10 13:14:00 The Saudi regime has already taken steps for the future seeing the worldwide trend in electric and dolor power.......but here we are pushing the future of coal and oil to keep the saudis in business......
6612 2018-10-10 13:13:52 Oh, wow, did we replace the oil shill with a coal shill?

Next, we'll replace the coal shill with a peat bog shill, then with the man who invented fire!

We don't need any more white power oligarchs, thanks, please crawl back into your tar pit.
6613 2018-10-10 13:13:44 @HEART_PUNE  Indian oil chowk after Suratwala building causes jam. There should be free flow of traffic towards Wakad bridge. Just a suggestion ,pls forward to concerned authorities.
6614 2018-10-10 13:13:43 Is she an expert at this? the consequences of "shut down a pipeline". Have any idiot play with valves that pump millions of gallons of oil and potentially cause an environmental disaster for something that they would simply replace, brilliant.
6615 2018-10-10 13:13:40 With good coconut oil the flavor isn’t pronounced, mouth feel is rich, and it is much less prone to oxidation. Additionally, we evolved with saturated fats; PUFAs have a short and inauspicious human safety record.

6618 2018-10-10 13:13:25 Those of you advocating for more than N24,000 should also advocate for total removal of fuel subsidy. Cameroon pay more than N350 per litre for PMS why should ours be different only to be smuggled away for other African countries and our oil dealers and custom officers to enjoy?
6619 2018-10-10 13:13:18 Omg IT pain. Wore my knee high boots yesterday (yay fall!!) Didn't realize until this morning the heels were worn down on one side by like 3 cm. Holy ouch!! Time for some peppermint oil and arnica!!

6643 2018-10-10 13:11:12 Is he talking about how climate change isn’t a thing and, if it is, it isn’t caused by man, and also that we need more coal, more oil, and less sustainable energy?
6644 2018-10-10 13:11:07 Well done to them. If you ever want to hear about an Irish environmental campaign to stop a Minnesota Plastic ( Oil ) Company - RTP Company - from opening a Plastic Factory in one of the most beautiful parts of the world, give us a shout!
6645 2018-10-10 13:11:00 over time the industry realized that the early harvest did not allow the hydrocarbons the necessary time to develop the hydrocarbon chains that produced diesel fuel, and in the long term, the heavy decline and lack of diesel eventually reaked havoc on oil prices. @Big_Orrin
6646 2018-10-10 13:10:59 not enough oil money to bring you back again ..not like some legends
6647 2018-10-10 13:10:57 Well, as Ronald Reagan said, 'trust but verify'.   fwiw, I think trusting oil companies, given a) their track records and b) the institutional constraints on them is likely to end in tears.  But tbf, EVERY path from here ends in tears....

6653 2018-10-10 13:10:39 Job growth is way down under Trump from Obama. Facts are facts. You can't use alternate facts or claim the news is fake. Wage growth is also down and inflation is up.

6670 2018-10-10 13:09:33 Businesses are suspending operations in #Harare and other cities, mainly retail-based firms due to liquidity constraints- this may actually help reduce pressure on FX demand in the near term- but the govt needs to do more to get FX, given rising oil prices and dearth of FDI.

6674 2018-10-10 13:09:31 The source rocks of every oil and gas reservoir on Earth today originate from era's of rich biodiversity (e.g. Carboniferous). I know of no source rocks that are pre-Cambrian, but the pre-Cam does have methane.

He accepts bribe money from #fossilfuels in exchange for ensuring that oil profits take precedence over sensible policies that can save humanity from extinction.

Vote @SenBillNelson, he protects!
6744 2018-10-10 13:03:08 2 days ago I trimmed my hair, I haven’t trimmed since I became natural(2 years and 8 months) 

Glad to say it was the best decision, I’m busying sectioning my hair and twisting it and my ends are so much smoother. I’m using the aloe vera spray and oil from @PurpulHair
6745 2018-10-10 13:03:07 Wait, how much oil are you going to put? :)
6746 2018-10-10 13:02:56 @HeyFranHey hey, when you began oil pulling, did you experience sinus/mucus drainage?
6747 2018-10-10 13:02:50 Thanks; it's a good chart. There is some noise though. The 10yr is tracking "growth" proxied by cyclicals despite underperforming inflation (relative to the TC&JA). Meanwhile, oil price gains are impacting the 10yr probably more than defensives. Still, good visual...

Serious and curious question.  How many years of CO2 sequestration as oil are we undoing per year?  Some numbers:

900BBL taken already
1700BBL proven reserves now
53y left at today's rate
Possible oil reserves?
Oil is fossilized algae.  Algae evolved ~850mya.

6787 2018-10-10 12:59:26 There is Pipeline capacity in SE.
Diffs are not as wide here as the North & heavier crude.
Still, some oil leaves by truck & heads south, some by train.
Currently, heavy oil is being trucked in & blended here to enter the system.
This will change as #WTI to #Brent spread widens.

6796 2018-10-10 12:58:16 What has price to do with pipeline capacity? Seems to me that its more like there is no demand for it hence the discount. The lower price displaces higher price oil. Ok

6814 2018-10-10 12:56:16 The issue is: at what price? And for how long? Also, remember who is the partner in the largest oil refinery that used to be the largest importer of Iranian oil!

6871 2018-10-10 12:50:27 @realDonaldTrump Not 700,000 barrels, not 1 million barrels, but 2.5 million barrels by November 4th should be completely cut off. Six months have passed, and no time should ever be given. In the same month, Iran's oil will be cut off completely, and this must be done
6872 2018-10-10 12:50:26 Hey oil nerds, the @EIAgov weekly data is out TOMORROW because of the Columbus Day holiday Monday. OPEC will release its Sept. reporter and OPEC secretary general Mohammed Barkindo will speak at the Oil & Money conference in London. #OOTT

6881 2018-10-10 12:49:26 State subsidies to prop up industry = left wing. But right wing parties subsidise fossil fuels the world over. In the US, this is due to legal corruption between oil companies and politicians. In Norway, it is all about preserving the status of oil so as not to weaken @Equinor

7007 2018-10-10 12:37:51 Stein was a snake oil saleswoman. Johnson was selling cannabis oil. And Hillary was anointed in oil, and became overconfident.
7008 2018-10-10 12:37:35 Big adulting today after being embarrassed at work. Getting my oil changed, figuring out how to pay my loans, and contacting someone about an apartment that I can actually afford.
7009 2018-10-10 12:37:16 Now they don't have to, article says this new low sulfur oil burns just as cleanly. What I want is huge subsidies to go solar & geothermal.

7011 2018-10-10 12:37:04 If I see an olive it better be on its way to be squeezed into oil, the only acceptable form of olive
7012 2018-10-10 12:37:02 Interesting you say this in that way, because I often see posts like this as an excuse to not do the small things that help until such a time as the drastic actions are possible. I see the “straw bans are cute but have you destroyed the entire oil industry” joke all the time
7013 2018-10-10 12:36:53 Boyfriends are odd creatures anyways. I mean the sheer column of farts is inhumane. Best not to worry too much about them. Try grated carrot and Asian chilli oil and orange juice as a side salad. Am obsessed.

7016 2018-10-10 12:36:47 need to reduce the rates of oil.....
7017 2018-10-10 12:36:43 I wonder what the PPV cost of this will be for a 48 year old. I can imagine the sponsors already Cod Liver Oil, Stanna stairlifts, Regaine, Saga Holidays, Viagra etc 
7018 2018-10-10 12:36:41 Admitting it would mean keeping or bring back regulations on corporations. Replacing Oil, & coal with other renewable energy, loss of corporate profits. He doesn’t care about what happens to the earth. What’s left in the pockets of corps and the wealthy are more important.
7019 2018-10-10 12:36:33 1. These are oil dispersant systems to contain a massive oceanic oil spill. 
2. Vapor trails you see in the sky are simply water condensation when hot exhaust mixes with cold air.
3. Actual air dispersal is always done at low level, not the level at which commercial flights fly.
7020 2018-10-10 12:36:27 I sat in a classroom in 1974 at age 10 and was told by scientists that we would run out of oil before I graduated from college & the earth was heading into a new ice age.
Our grandchildren will never see this clip, cause propagandists like you will continue to rewrite history.

7024 2018-10-10 12:36:09 Big Oil’s Bet on Natural Gas Is a Slow Burn

Oct.9 (Dow Jones) -- Big Oil is betting on natural gas as the fuel of the future, but companies face a challenge to show they can make as much money producing and selling cargoes of gas as they could from tankers of crude

7029 2018-10-10 12:35:15 If Dems were winning there would be no talk of changing the Constitution

Progressivism and The Constitution are like oil and water

Libs attack the 1st and 2nd Am. daily.

You can see their fury at losing the SCOTUS....its the only way they get their unwanted policies made law.
7030 2018-10-10 12:35:12 It's October, and East Europeans are at work in Roundhay Park woods again, harvesting beech nuts – presumably they'll send them abroad for eating/pressing for oil. If they're so good, why don't we use them? Mind you, post-Brexit, we probably won't have any choice.
7031 2018-10-10 12:35:09 Remember guys, a Cat 4/5 dead on into a non-infrastructure, densely populated area is actually very bullish for oil product demand and GDP.

Also, it calls for over half of the GoM production to be shut in, even though it doesn't even touch it.
7032 2018-10-10 12:35:04 gas prices will go up at the pumps this weekend because of greed of the government wants to stay super rich since there turning off the oil wells down south greedy

7044 2018-10-10 12:34:07 I thinks that’s why u see so many corrupt politicians they don’t know how long they will get it and want to ensure they hav something when it’s all over because there is nothing else to do. Rather than improve the society roads, bring in tech to refine their own oil, manufacture

7051 2018-10-10 12:33:55 Does anyone remember that 15 of the 19 911 terrorist were Saudi? The Saudi gov oppresses women, fears truth, murders truth-tellers and loves Trump - he’s their guy. Our dependence on Saudi oil has declined but #Trump lusts after autocratic leaders no matter what. #Kashoggi
7052 2018-10-10 12:33:53 The president has sent condolences and the wife to his deputy will exorcise the devil at the crash site with "holy oil". Miseries of poverty!

7055 2018-10-10 12:33:42 #sciabicas  You should tell the story of your delicious Olive Oil on this podcast!
7056 2018-10-10 12:33:37 I think Sierra club just wants Scott to ADMIT that there is climate change, certainly he has not done so in his legislation. What bothers me r all those oil rigs sitting in that area. That is appalling, but he is a trumpster so another BP disaster has potential right this minute
7057 2018-10-10 12:33:37 How do u adhere to warnings when u don’t have d tools to do that?Rem oil prices was at its worst so tell me what do u do and rem u re a mono economy..pls educate me
7058 2018-10-10 12:33:36 Now is not the time for that. We need to be making friends of more ppl who have been sold on #Trump's snake oil & are sick on it. A Dem Congress cannot squander their political capital on hearing after hearing. Do the ppl's business first. Just focus on winning.

7061 2018-10-10 12:33:22 and it has money to look for oil in the artic!
7062 2018-10-10 12:33:20 Even restricting oil revenue to producing states, some states will never have fierce political contest to be governors. 

But some smart governors will make their states economically viable than oil producing states.

7071 2018-10-10 12:32:15 That would likely crash the global economy or force the West to rely more heavily on middle eastern oil sources.

7076 2018-10-10 12:31:43 There is a very good argument but i think coal production also takes power and transport and infrastructure. processing may help the ev cause, but diesel is closer to raw oil I believe.

7079 2018-10-10 12:31:35 Is it about the low carbon economy fund? Otherwise if she is here to announce new oil&gas projects I am ready to get arrested for civil disobedience.

7081 2018-10-10 12:31:21 @MorningsMaria @SteveForbesCEO : Did you see how fast we went from low oil prices to almost $100/bbl?  That could happen with inflation if there is a policy error. Trump stimulus cannot collide with expansionary monetary policy. Inflation is the problem right now!!
7082 2018-10-10 12:31:19 Obama was surgically operated on his brain after he was sworn in. The occult never wanted him and had to timid him for office so he didn't try what Kennedy did and take on the cartels. Big business in "hydra" oil

7089 2018-10-10 12:30:47 However the carbon footprint can be negated by (eg) planting, a plastic bag is a long term problem and a terrible use of a resource like petroleum oil.... so please use an alternative as soon as... please

7092 2018-10-10 12:30:31 I think a question that needs some pondering is: If shale is a source rock, and we are now producing oil from source rock, will that cause faster decline in the reservoir rock that the source rock was feeding? Maybe off base...

Oil companies weren’t responsible for the Iraq war
7119 2018-10-10 12:27:44 @piersmorgan Just watching your Churchill bit. It was Stalin wasn't it not Churchill and the fact that Hitler had to attack oil rich Russia to his east. It's not fair to claim it was Churchill. Also, it was Japan who got US involved in the war, not Churchill. He did hate Indians.
7120 2018-10-10 12:27:42 #NGT in the matter of Aditya N Prasad & Ors vs. UoI & Ors. has directed leading Oil companies to install Stage I and Stage II vapor recovering devices at all fuel stations, distribution centers , terminals ,airports etc in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.

7124 2018-10-10 12:27:33 But the terms of doing business with SA have changed as they privatize their oil market. I understood that Trump & MBS agreed on terms that included opening the US market to SA, which brought American oil companies into direct competition with them at home. Do you agree?

7137 2018-10-10 12:26:15 This piece is brilliant! Where is the outrage at all this warmongering, ignited by the FDD and other neocon thinktanks! At the same time, SA is being discredited, Haley has resigned, Europe set up a Special Purpose Vehicle to circumvent sanctions, India continues to buy crude oil
7138 2018-10-10 12:26:11 tbh, I am wondering was their solution actually sold to anybody, used by anybody and whether it solves anything or is it just your typical infosec snake oil? looking at their website and what I can find other places, it seems like the latter.

7143 2018-10-10 12:25:45 Before this all started my hydro/water bill was about $125 per month and now it is $195 per month. My gas tank costs about $80 to fill. That is because the left does not want us to develop our oil/natural gas resources. Which we have in abundance.
7144 2018-10-10 12:25:24 My to do list today has been filled with obstacles.  Gas in car Oil change has a minimum 2 hr wait...car wash closed...hoping the grocery store can be accessed!!!
7145 2018-10-10 12:25:16 Ahh I missed the fact that pollutants came from (among others) oil companies, so to shift the burden, oil companies increase gas price. That makes it clear about your standpoint.

So gov has to regulate oil ceiling price too, then?
7146 2018-10-10 12:25:13 OIL 1H piercing & braking below 20MA. WATCH SCO ?
7147 2018-10-10 12:25:12 People born and raised in America don’t want to work the oil fields, and the complicated labor jobs and work their way up to something better. Cesar Milan is a wonderful example of an illegal immigrant who worked their way up. The moment we become threatened because they ‘might’

7149 2018-10-10 12:24:57 I see this IMF and Chinese deal as a way to break Pakistan. May western powers want Balochistan, which have bundles of reserves in oil and gas
7150 2018-10-10 12:24:51 I use the paint for the base and then go over it with oil, I haven't watched any tutorials so I still have no idea what I'm doing lol
7151 2018-10-10 12:24:49 Cars (minus classics) should run on batteries in the next 25 years. We are slowly eliminating the need for oil. Because of its stock market impact and lack of technology, it'll be a slow process. Ethanol is a short term fix and alternative to keep oil prices stable. It's a game.
7152 2018-10-10 12:24:48 I better run along to get my car’s oil changed before the rain hits... 
7153 2018-10-10 12:24:43 gas, que la oposición vote extinción de dominio y entregue OIL y otras empresas de López a las petroleras que reclaman el ajuste, así recobraron los más de 10 MIL MILLONES que ya hay pruebas contundentes que robó al estado, no olviden las tragamonedas que vendió a testaferro
7154 2018-10-10 12:24:40 2/2 @ImranKhanPTI  Cheap and limitless energy will change the growth trajectory of the country, no more oil import bills, no gas shortages (electric ovens, geezers), everything powered by solar energy, free power for industry, you need to think out of the box.

7176 2018-10-10 12:21:49 If I was an oil exec, I’d consider the donation to a nonprofit a tax write-off that is also good PR, and throw 10x the money at the best lobbyists against any action.
7177 2018-10-10 12:21:48 Literally the ONLY benefits. Downsides include; having to multicoat, cos it hasn't got the coverage of oil based, scuffs easy, peels off if used on bannisters, doesn't flow very well so hard to get perfect straight lines.

7211 2018-10-10 12:17:40 Of course oil sanctions hit hard the children and adults in Iran. Oil is main source of revenue - for food, medical care, transportation, paying debts, water, electricity, etc..U.S. is the largest producing oil country, but that is not enough, wants even lower prices.

7279 2018-10-10 12:09:40 #Spicejet's stock looks good at 68. It's undeniably a risky bet due to fluctuating crude oil prices & USD/INR ex. rate affecting the fuel costs which are 40-50% of operational costs. Passenger growth is strong but profits will be under pressure! #Aviation #Nifty #ETMarkets #NSE

7287 2018-10-10 12:08:57 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

7289 2018-10-10 12:08:50 I believe that's a  misreading of cats because they show no discernable  emotion when their people are in distress. My cats share even their favorite tuna in oil. They are democratic socialists.

7323 2018-10-10 12:04:43 If this is right, we should be informing NATO nations and Japan, that if they want oil they had better form their own means of protecting these bastards, 'cos we're outie. There are precious few good guys for an alliance

7338 2018-10-10 12:03:42 Congrats to all things EV, great progress - but oil & gas industry isn't stupid. They've seen it coming for years, know it'll increase, & invest accordingly. Oil/gas will take more of a back seat supplying vehicles, but for now plenty of other customers - demand up year on year.
7339 2018-10-10 12:03:39 Last night's feast was amazing!

Strips of chicken with salt and pepper, fried in olive oil.
Once cooked drizzled in lemon and honey, and stirred in.

All on a plate of salad with the juice poured over it. Bloody marvelous!

Oh, it took 10 minutes from raw chicken to the table!

7384 2018-10-10 11:58:44 Yeah but what happened to a once in a generation/lifetime? 4 years later? Democracy was answered now its being thrown back at us because it doesn’t suit? What currency? What armed forces? What about the £5bn oil deficit to their 2014 white paper? What about £450m tax shortfall?
7385 2018-10-10 11:58:43 Let me be clear. Had Venezuela’s net oil revenues been reported monthly on a per capita basis, the Venezuelan tragedy would not be happening, and most likely an oil revenue sharing program would already be in effect, guaranteeing a better use of these revenues.

7477 2018-10-10 11:47:09 I believe it's more symbiotic than that: the oil industry wouldn't have anyone to sell to if people demanded less gas for their cars, factory farming of livestock would die out if people ate organic meat. Supply follows demand, not vice versa.

7556 2018-10-10 11:39:04 2- The same scenario was taking place during the 80ies and the big hype of ( N Sea) ( GOM) oil and how it would change the world of production and consumer appetite. Then came the 90ies and the Caspian oil

Supplement their clean dog food with raw or cooked veggies, brocolli, cawliflower, carrots.  I also put a few drops of MCT oil and fish oil to their dinner meal.
7567 2018-10-10 11:37:34 British were also complicit in bringing about WWI for oil, power & land grab. British Secret Service were active, agitating the Serbs in the Balkans well before Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated. Our servicemen were used and abused by a bent rich & powerful establishment.

7579 2018-10-10 11:36:21 So the earth spends hundreds of millions of years sequestering carbon in biomass into coal/oil ending up in an environment suitable for humans. Humans burn *huge* amounts of that carbon in a little over a hundred years and those monied by it sell us a myth that it's all good?
7580 2018-10-10 11:36:17 So we need to stop the destruction of the rain forests for palm oil and timber.  We could do with a lot more planting in temperate zone.  Poor forest management has lead to forest fires burning lots of natural forests for instance on the north west coast of America.

7606 2018-10-10 11:32:50 Ofcourse the fall of rupee, the lower GDP than expected, and rise of oil prices to maintain fiscal deficit indicates otherwise, but hey these data doesn't matter it's more about how people feel.

7612 2018-10-10 11:32:25 US production has increased from 6.5 MBD in 2012 to 10.5 MBD so far in 2018. That is a 4 MBD increase of mostly light oil. Imports are down from 8.52 MBD in 2012. Combination of higher refinery run rate and export has taken care of the excess production.

7674 2018-10-10 11:25:45 The fossil fuel extraction process by Shell (and other oil majors) will have a much lower carbon footprint than the many other industries who use the extracted fuels and are widely ignored. I'm not saying they are innocent, but are only a part of the chain.

You have to fuel, service, buy oil.

Run up and down to put it on and off.

7691 2018-10-10 11:24:34 We have no such thing as a "free market."

The "freer market" of the past allowed corps to brutalize people, poison consumers & led to anti-trust legislation.

Let's return to "freer markets" by killing billions of subsidies for the oil & gas industry. Start there.

7697 2018-10-10 11:24:14 Even after the nautical border was changed, almost all of the oil and gas is in Scottish waters. Nothing to worry about, and hardly worth quibbling over, except for the pleasure of it.
7698 2018-10-10 11:24:12 There is one. When I was laid off from my job in oil and gas (legal end) CareerLink told me there was funding for energy workers to go back to school. The guy in charge at our local office just never called me back.

7704 2018-10-10 11:23:47 Pain. In FL smoking weed is illegal so you vape the oil or use just oil.  I went to the dispensary thinking they would have edibles or suckers but they don't.  I've only been once and got the vape but it caused me respiratory problems.  It help my pain but coughing made it worse.
7705 2018-10-10 11:23:43 Okay, apart from the fact that most of the oil is in Scotland’s waters; I wonder what she thinks of the UK’s financial independence?

7756 2018-10-10 11:18:23 Why would one of the worlds largest oil companies lie, or better yet, fudge the numbers of one of its biggest consumers. I really have to assume you’re being ironic or just trolling here.

7762 2018-10-10 11:17:53 I think what people are missing is that the market economy has no way of creating a pricing signal for the value of the climate or nature as whole, functioning systems.

7830 2018-10-10 11:09:49 The hell that fuking place is an ally. A country that kidnaps, murders and chops journalists into pieces has no business being an ally at all. We're supposed to be drawing down on oil anyway. Might as well kick it off now.
7831 2018-10-10 11:09:38 What 'fabulous' reports does he have? There are fabulous, optimistic reports on the climate? Did he get them from the oil companies. I'd like to see who 'drew' those reports. Smdh

The oil is in Scottish waters and if Shetland were ever silly enough to seperate from Scotland they could only claim waters 20 miles from their shores.
It's international law - look it up.

7875 2018-10-10 11:05:22 if Oil is apparently running out why even worry where borders are?
One report published earlier this year by Professor Alex Kemp of Aberdeen University estimated that as much as 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent could be recovered from the UK’s continental shelf until 2050.

7898 2018-10-10 11:02:30 So who particularly stopped the payment for several years even when we made so much money from oil sales. We must be doing something right.
7899 2018-10-10 11:01:58 Also singularly responsible for demonizing Iran...traditional rivals of Saudi. Ayatollah Khonemini was after all hosted and propped up in France to overthrow the Shah. Shah's crime ; did not agree to give 90% of produce of oil and said it belonged to people of Iran.

7932 2018-10-10 10:57:09 Wow 5% to Beijing is very interesting. I definitely can't see that happening, would be a national security threat to the us to see China owning a stake in the Arab American Oil Company. I would guess a private stake sale is possible but an IPO may help future stake sales...

7940 2018-10-10 10:56:35 Rick Scott wants to DESTROY FLORIDA'S ENVIRONMENT by bringing FRACKING to our state so he can make money for his hidden oil investments. He's a low-life, self-serving, egotistical elitist, JUST LIKE YOU.  I will NEVER vote for ANY republican.  BLUE WAVE!
7941 2018-10-10 10:56:34 LOL, The land of the pure has no shortage of such snake oil salesmen who have quick fixes that can cure any ailment. We as a nation seem incapable of taking a long hard look at our problems and solving them through honest hard work and patience, because that is boring.

7950 2018-10-10 10:54:26 This is another thing that seals it for me. Ted does not want to reimpose regulations on oil. The US is now the largest supplier of oil making us free from foreign suppliers which led to senseless wars in the past. I like LESS government and more freedom of our resources! 
7951 2018-10-10 10:54:18 some folks attached to “100 companies responsible for 71% of carbon emissions” don’t seem to realize basic facts like a) the data covers emissions from 1988-2015 and b) these mostly oil/coal/petroleum companies have customers

He never supported @GEJonathan. Now Nigerians are jumping up & jubilating for Atiku as if he is the messiah. Another Fulani tool people
8080 2018-10-10 10:33:56 would require more money to finance drill projects which would translate to collecting more taxes like excise tax on oil. with limited oil reserves, we need alternative sources like solar or bio fuel. that would help drive the price down

8196 2018-10-10 10:17:57 There's nothing to support the idea we could support 28 billion people. Or even half. Current agricultural practices could feed up to 11 billion, are the calculations, if divided fair. But those depend on cheap oil. And that's a resources rapidly depleting.

Which will invest more into Education from oil revenues?

8371 2018-10-10 09:54:44 Clove oil will ease it
8372 2018-10-10 09:54:31 อยากไปคอนบังทัน กรี๊ดดดด โว๊ยยยยย อยากไปปปปป
8373 2018-10-10 09:54:22 As someone who has seen oil rigs and construction workers for energy projects all over this planet, not one of those holes were started without a cup of coffee first.
8374 2018-10-10 09:54:08 and various other factors...since they're a different country...different oil resources etc, how they fund their roads, population etc, but I get the feeling facts are too hard for some...
8375 2018-10-10 09:54:03 In order to increase the proportion of EURO in reserve currency in Asia, the proportion of EURO in oil settlement currency should be increased.
8376 2018-10-10 09:54:02 Middle East and South America seem to converge when the oil price is high and diverge when this falls.
8377 2018-10-10 09:53:53 Yeah, there’s a technical term for that behaviour. It’s called “acting”. 

For example, it may come as a shock to you, but Daniel Day-Lewis is actually NOT REALLY a young poet with cerebral palsy, a New Mexico oil prospector or Abraham Lincoln.

8381 2018-10-10 09:53:18 Sure, but the same can be said for remote areas where renewables aren't functional and are currently heavily reliant on oil/diesel/gas. All low carbon technologies have a role to play.
8382 2018-10-10 09:53:17 ピアノと白兎の再録って実在するの？
8383 2018-10-10 09:53:00 Vitol’s Ian Taylor questions why big oil companies are going into “funky” renewables. He asks if they understand what they are doing. Glencore’s Alex Beard Jones it’s a “corporate responsibility” push. In other words green washing.
8384 2018-10-10 09:52:52 mine too... i bought rosehip and rosemary oil and i gotta start using them hshd ive read good reviews on both hopefully they will work

8390 2018-10-10 09:52:37 Glencore Worldwide Oil Operations Head Beard: Peak Oil Demand Is Not Coming Anytime Soon
8391 2018-10-10 09:52:36 16 tankers of 220 barrels @ 202 liters per barrel..
Only 4 tankers away from the 1 million LTRs of oil.
The 1 Million, of anything, is a mile stone.

8395 2018-10-10 09:51:47 @Flora please can you tell me why you use palm oil in your dairy free spread? Most people using it will be doing so with ethics in mind, but I don’t want to be funding deforestation? Most “sustainable” sources are far from. @RainforestCx
8396 2018-10-10 09:51:44 @FoxBusinessAM @cherylcasone & @SimonettiLauren : What's happening in The oil market is a clear indication of how easy it is for excess capacity to be absorbed out of an economy. Inflation could become an issue. It's crucial for The Fed to keep tightening contrary to #DJTrump!!!
8397 2018-10-10 09:51:32 @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo @ShehuSani please how much has oil price been for almost 9 months now? What is happening to the too much excess gains and profit? Why is poverty still on the land? Remember what excuse you gave us for the still on going recession.
8398 2018-10-10 09:51:27 Does this solve the fact three quarters of the F1 grid requires pay drivers to survive?. Can a woman that wins this series get a drive over a man who say brings oil money?.

8401 2018-10-10 09:51:17 Glencore’s Alex Beard says he does not see peak oil demand coming any time soon. Doesn’t impact how he thinks about downstream/deals and acquisition.

8407 2018-10-10 09:49:42 Agreed. Truffle oil can be, especially fake truffle oil, hellish petroleum scented poison.

8415 2018-10-10 09:48:46 The loss of life over oil, power & land grabs are never worth it. It might interest people to know that the British were complicit in bringing about WWI for those very reasons. Our service personnel have been used and abused for decades by a bent rich & powerful establishment.

8433 2018-10-10 09:46:55 Also the rationale spouted by the Wilson government to justify selling arms to Nigeria during the Biafran war, in order to protect UK oil interests.
8434 2018-10-10 09:46:46 It’s damn good. Quality truffle oil being the key.
8435 2018-10-10 09:46:46 Look I’m not gonna say I could fix the planet, but what if the people that own all the oil that we REALLY don’t want to burn up had it all bought up by some lovely philanthropist billionaire?! they just buy all the oil, leave it the fuck alone and don’t burn it.
8436 2018-10-10 09:46:44 Chef Louis cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Play-Doh.

8442 2018-10-10 09:45:34 Oil is a conventional source of energy. Do you think that consumption of petrol should be same like it was 4 yrs before ?
It's natural that petrol price will increase. India don't have that much oil reserves. You can't compare price of petrol from the past.
8443 2018-10-10 09:45:22 His Oil & Gas buddies won’t be happy. Trump doing this because he screwed farmers with his tariffs and is fearful of GOP losing elections in November

8449 2018-10-10 09:44:13 Are you aware of UNCLOS? It basically covers the law of the sea and maritime borders. Even with the twisted border imposed by Labour, Scotland has 96% of oil wells within its economic area. When international law corrects this anomaly, 100% of oil wells will be Scottish.
8450 2018-10-10 09:44:10 Well made point by @Richard_Dixon of @FoEScot at @CommonsScotAffs committee hearing on future of O&G industry: We are currently not taking into account the social cost of burning oil and gas

8452 2018-10-10 09:43:52 On #MER @Richard_Dixon says the cost of oil needs to reflect the cost of repairing the environmental damage. Oil industry is ‘in denial’ about climate change

8464 2018-10-10 09:41:23 Sorry but the SNP pulled the same 'milk & honey' stunt as Leave in #IndyRef, promising a multi-billion oil fund, mass oil exports, a Scandi welfare state on low taxes, that "Scotland paid its way", the £15bn deficit didnt exist plus more.

8505 2018-10-10 09:35:15 Probably paid a visit or 3 to a few oil company execs and consequently nothing of substance eventuated. Todd McClay would have been able to give her a heads up on what to do.
8506 2018-10-10 09:35:07 Blair moved the North Sea Boundaries in a sly vote late at night that he knew Scots could not block, but the oil fields revert back to Scotland on independence. There are handful that will be left in English waters.

8513 2018-10-10 09:33:49 2/2 And similarly, what about the role the vested corps play in obfuscating well established science? VERY similar strategies have been employed by the cigarette, oil, coal, meat/dairy, and auto industries. They seed doubt in the mind of the consumer, holding up progress.

8519 2018-10-10 09:33:16 @ryanelijah  I was reading on the oil this is what I found.  According to the company, the area was previously considered to be a mature oil basin. Oil is expected to flow beginning in 2021, with a potential rate approaching 120,000 barrels per day.  @LARZIK

8522 2018-10-10 09:33:09 Dream on. We’d have no divorce bill at all as we have no debt. But we’d rent you faslane for 20 bn for 8 years while you spend money you no longer have (as we’d have the oil, gas, hydro, wind, fishing, and whisky funds as well as your 20bn) building your own replacement port.

8553 2018-10-10 09:27:27 It wasn't shock for a country just recovering from a 30 year war and when the oil bill consumed 70% of your import bill, which planet are you from? Imagine the current inept losers couldn't even handle 30$ barrel and still the rupee collapsed to 150 in the first year alone.

8587 2018-10-10 09:22:46 The main thing Buhari is good at is just borrowing funds. In the midst of high oil production and high prices; high non oil sector revenues, the Buhari govt engages in borrowing spree. This govt is highly mortgaging our future. It is most unfortunate. Cluelessness redefined.
8588 2018-10-10 09:22:42 Works for me. Grid powered by full renewable, rooftop solar power, power buffer systems (battery, kinetic, hydrogen). Use the oil for important things. Don't just burn it up. We are squandering a natural resource.

8594 2018-10-10 09:22:01 So long as (a) the percentage of NZ produced oil used in NZ is above zero & (b) that production ceases faster than alternatives come online, yes. 

But is that significant or likely? Depends on the percentage in (a) & timing in (b). Which brings us back to my original question.

Note that he doesn't mention who's going to pay the trees, which will enable him to keep selling oil. It's called greenwashing.

I wouldn't bank on any election outcome. With unionist party collusion, dark money, a propagandistic media and every arm of the British state deployed to stop the loss of their oil, anything is possible. Now's  the time.

8675 2018-10-10 09:13:31 Dr Norman, we will import oil regardless,  so why not produce locally and earn significant royalties for the NZ Government? Also, NZ oil is much lighter and sweeter than many overseas crudes, so unless demand drops is it not better doing it here than using say heavy tar sand oil?

8734 2018-10-10 09:05:22 One thing I found works for this sort of thing is freezing it in an ice-cube tray and then emptying the frozen cubes into a box or bag. You can then defrost one or two as needed. I do this with leftover fresh herbs (with some olive oil) too.

8784 2018-10-10 08:57:47 @SHARESmag Hi! May I ask if #UKOG  is under your radar for near-term coverage? I think an objective  summary of the story so far makes for a fascinating read. Oil tankers are leaving #HorseHill as I type filled with high quality oil no fracking required.
8785 2018-10-10 08:57:41 Just like India and China, population is power. 

We have the population to make tech have greater impact than oil on our GDP. But we have no structures on ground.

Just a little support from Government, there will be a tech boom.

8790 2018-10-10 08:57:14 It's always the pesky Russians. It's Russia's 65bil spending's fault that the US spends close to a trillion on military intelligence complex and has around 1000 bases ranging from Niger to Guatemala. Don't forget China's investment in Somalian Oil field. But forget abt trident.

8858 2018-10-10 08:46:31 But those are predominantly oil companies. And they're producing that oil because we keep buying the stuff. Plus they're never going to regulate themselves. Individuals are the only ones who can change this by voting and by lowering our consumption (of planes and cars).

9041 2018-10-10 08:22:39 Once oil gets back in the $100 to $150 bbl range, expect Offshore Drilling to come back, strong.
Until then, markets are likely to churn.

We are working with partners to drive change, and to address the systemic issues in the palm oil industry, with an ambition to build a 100% responsible palm oil supply. 1/2

9064 2018-10-10 08:19:31 More Lies from lying Ted. The Gas prices raised, cause Trump pulled out of the Iran deal. Now he tries to convince the Saudis to pump more Oil, so it gets cheaper, but they refused. Russia does the same.
9065 2018-10-10 08:19:23 Effect of Saturn on crude oil price, Rupee and macro. That’s completely out of the box 
9066 2018-10-10 08:19:21 .@BP_plc’s Dudley may disagree about the notion of oil and gas being squeezed from the energy mix but, “no offense”, coal needs to be on the way out #OM2018

9069 2018-10-10 08:18:50 I would like to recommend that Mr. Tillerson, an oil expert, former Exxon president, and former minister of state, is the best person.
9070 2018-10-10 08:18:50 .@BP_plc ceo Dudley: In a scenario consistent with Paris, this could mean oil demand 10% lower in 2040 than today - but this still means substantial amounts of the fossil fuel will be needed #OM2018
9071 2018-10-10 08:18:24 Like I said, India does not have the resources we have, and that is why they developed other sectors. They didn't do that because they were electing integrity over competence. A man of integrity can also be ignorant.
What is stopping us from developing our non oil sectors?
9072 2018-10-10 08:18:16 I think it is more complex than mass demos vs economic collapse, but the declining economy was crucial. Reductions in consumer goods and problems with import of key resources (oil) sparked mass emigration and by 1989 this has hit a crisis point that demanded some kind of change

9076 2018-10-10 08:17:34 And I don’t think they can afford it (especially since I can mention at least 5 nations which want to see them dead now and will find 300$ oil as a good justification (two of them have the independent capacity to “redirect” China purchase)) unless USN have an opinion against it.

9087 2018-10-10 08:16:04 you can add a few drops of peppermint or cinnamon essential oil for a nice refreshing taste too 
9088 2018-10-10 08:15:58 That’s why it’s puzzling that’s it empty when they’ve been given the biggest handout in football. General sale for Barcelona at home. Tragic. That oil should have gone to Newcastle.

9091 2018-10-10 08:15:50 Second this oil, it’s absolutely amazing and I got it as a freebie with another Shiseido purchase, Shiseido are great for the decent gifts. Any cleansing oil will do though, doesn’t need to be a fancy expensive one. I like the pixi x Caroline Hirons double cleanse also 
9092 2018-10-10 08:15:38 Hello Chloe, our Midnight Recovery Oil is perfect for night as it is infused with Lavender essential oil. It is an aromatic oil known for its soothing properties. We hope it was relaxing .
9093 2018-10-10 08:15:37 1. Yes we are. Merely looking at how this government planned to fund this year's budget will tell the full story. We are still very much dependent on oil

9102 2018-10-10 08:14:40 Yes I know, switching costs, but if oil goes to $300 (if say, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were nuked by Iran), China will be forced to pay the switching cost.

9114 2018-10-10 08:12:54 Unclear to me why rationing (and its bureaucracy) is a better solution than Pigovian taxes to the oil industry's carbon pollution. Very useful if you could explain.
9115 2018-10-10 08:12:53 .@BP_plc ceo Dudley: "Oil and gas supply would be constrained and prices would likely rise, slowing global economic growth...This could have serious consequences for both financial stability and economic prosperity" #OM2018
9116 2018-10-10 08:12:30 Maybe she's meaning economically. How the fuck is Scotland attributed so little through GERS when it is responsible for 90% UK oil & gas, 99% UK whisky, 70% UK gin, £944M worth of seafood exports.....?

9119 2018-10-10 08:12:12 But supply chain adjustment takes time and high capital (China don’t have any of those thing) especially since oil is quiet strategic (no 1. Most traded commodity on planet for that reason).

It's very simple. Chop the cabbage, then fry on the pan on high heat to remove the moisture, add to the pot. Fry your sausages, bacon then add to pot with oil from frying. Cut potatoes. Mix together and boil until soft
9194 2018-10-10 08:01:27 Please how is what you’re saying making any sense? 1. Are still very dependent on oil revenues or not? 2. Has there been massive investments in agriculture to diversify the economy? 3. Has NEPC taken steps to help promote and assist exporter? Please answer these questions

9237 2018-10-10 07:54:35 Three years later, we're yet to find the tools. We're still hoping that the price of crude oil should climb back to $140/barrel

9326 2018-10-10 07:38:20 @afneil here’s @BBCNews noting that had U.K. used scottish oil to create sovereign fund it could be like Norway but instead we only slightly better off than Portugal. Only @IMFNews saying so. Public money in private hands. Does that explain the rise of the @theSNP to you now?

9615 2018-10-10 06:55:36 That’s always been the paradox of current electric cars though right? We stop burning oil to plug into a socket that burns coal. Not only maintaining the same level of pollution, but putting further strain on a failing infrastructure.
9616 2018-10-10 06:55:31 ...why is this Baba borrowing again...whereas our crude oil now sells for well over US$80 per barrel...

9635 2018-10-10 06:49:51 That's pretty damn cool. Seeing things like this just hours after one of my region's ill-managed and ill-advised oil pipelines *just exploded* is a good reminder that progress can still be made in the right direction.
9636 2018-10-10 06:49:49 Do you have any suggestions? One thing I've been surprised to find is there's no hipster startup making ethanol. Actual ethanol production could undercut oil companies enough that they'd have to make real changes toward standardizing biofuel.

10 months on a 2 litre bottle of cooking oil is pretty amazing. I guess that depends on the construct of one’s diet. But it also demonstrates that the metric of poverty in Zimbabwe is measured by the amount of cooking oil available mumuriwo

9666 2018-10-10 06:45:40 And all should remember OIL is causing it. OIL burned in the engine of your cars. So say thank you to #BigOil for making this happen.
9667 2018-10-10 06:45:36 We can win the battle of climate change by raising the price of energy. The price of Oil must be at least 150 USD/barrel. In this case, we may no longer need public funding. It’s not so difficult with financial instruments !
9668 2018-10-10 06:45:27 He should also be scared of all that oil catching fire on his head.
9669 2018-10-10 06:45:13 Multiplying oil prices with the amount of barrels we produce per day is enough to take us out of any we have in this country.

9779 2018-10-10 06:25:39 How much olive oil is too much
9780 2018-10-10 06:25:37 The irony of the term “snake oil” is that the actual genuine product is a legitimate medicine still used today. It was the wave of fraudsters who tried to ride the popularity of the genuine product by peddling fake or inferior versions that caused the redefinition of the term.
9781 2018-10-10 06:25:35 ya’ll I’m a firm believer of CBD oil for migraines. Even some of the most expensive or strongest meds were not helping me and only made me feel worse at times, it’s crazy how much this stuff has helped without the ugly side effects.

9811 2018-10-10 06:20:16 Agreed! Many people choose a car not over reliable and efficient public transport, but because there’s no alternative. Govt deliberately invested in car culture over public transport, not in small part due to links to auto and oil industries.

9887 2018-10-10 06:09:10 I used baby oil in the basin. Better vegetable oil but I was not going to leave the poor thing in terror. Some bitch down stair told on me for taking it to my roommate. If you see trap fold it over and dispose. I Oslo set snap traps off when I see one.
9888 2018-10-10 06:08:55 It is very tempting to believe that the export of our resources, oil, LNG, etc will displace coal in the rest of the world but the reality isn't always as simple as what's on paper. Our survival will require a radical shift in thinking. The trouble is it will likely come too late
9889 2018-10-10 06:08:51 It's 12 years since the Cons promised a Made In Canada plan to replace Kyoto and never delivered it.

It's 12 years until pipelines and the Tarsands have to stop burning oil. Are you sticking with the plan to build #TMX? I think you'll copy the Cons and never #GetReal.

9914 2018-10-10 06:04:43 If selling LNG will help us reduce global emissions that is a good thing.. If we can use Canadian oil to meet Canada's needs for oil and then use the proceeds to fight climate change that is also a good thing. If you want to fight climate change you need to build consensus.

9960 2018-10-10 05:59:35 Good on @Melissa4Durack for telling it like it is.

Activists go for coal first, next will be gas and last (because activists love international travel and modern technology) the oil and petrochemical sector.

Coal and gas are key Australian exports - exports carry the economy.

9979 2018-10-10 05:56:59 I'm 55yrs old. When I was a kid I loved the local Science Museum. We were discussing a possible ice age, no more oil by 2000. Etc. Most warming models were way over actual for 2000-2010. It's just a guess, not a fact. Keep Calm. There is change, but hype is hype.
9980 2018-10-10 05:56:51 Excellent! A 2018 conference and all you can muster is an attack against a 2014 paper showing an estimation from before an unexpected oil crash.  The unionist fear is starting to cause ‘say something bad, anything bad’ syndrome to become laughingly predictable.
9981 2018-10-10 05:56:38 You realize that the green alternatives all require lots of oil, gas & coal in their manufacturing? Steel doesn’t coke itself. If you destroy the oil & gas industries, how will you build them?

9984 2018-10-10 05:55:40 ARAMCO's value is a function of electric vehicles replacing combustion engine cars. Why?
2/3 of global oil is used in transport sector.

ARAMCO\s value? ~$1 trillion, not $2 T or $3 T.
