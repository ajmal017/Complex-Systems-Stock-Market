48 2018-12-12 23:56:33 Alberta isn't the only province that gives transfer payments, and also currently receives as much as ontario does.

However, in none transfer payments, alberta has received a sixth of what quebec received in the last decade, and oil have received 130 billion in the last 10 years.

63 2018-12-12 23:54:25 The carbon trading industry and green renewal industry isn't being phased out because it needs to be in ontario, it's being forced out by conservative governments that hate it.

Also: More oil exported today then years ago. The right needs to take personal responsiblity.

What have you done for pipeline, Oil field, auto workers? NOT only nothing, you’ve crushed their jobs! #cdnpoli
78 2018-12-12 23:51:39 Perhaps the price rise was also due to the change in oil prices? Thanks for so clearly illustrating why making it a political issue was a bloody stupid move on Simon's part.

109 2018-12-12 23:48:21 1) I was being somewhat cheeky.
2) If H didn't buy it, someone else would have.  Not sure I follow the moral argument here -- that's like saying there shouldn't be oil or energy companies.

117 2018-12-12 23:47:10 Does anyone out there have an actual alternative solution?  Do people realize that Houthi control of the Bab-el-Mandeb means Iran could hold hostage 25% of the World's oil traffic?

Do our Senators know what's at stake here?
118 2018-12-12 23:47:04 El Chapo's trial today presented testimony Petróleos Méxicanos (the Mexican state-owned oil company), used its tankers to transport drugs and that Colombian rebel groups, FARC and Autodefensas Unidas, sold drugs to El Cartel de Sinaloa.

121 2018-12-12 23:46:19 I don’t know how selling $80 Colorado Hemp Oil to aid “performance” can fit into those categories. IRS needs to enforce its rules properly.
122 2018-12-12 23:46:19 Who said I was against oil?   I've worked in the oilfield and i'm well aware of what petrochemicals provide us.  I'm against lying assholes that misrepresent every issue for their political gain.
123 2018-12-12 23:46:16 Go out to the oil patch and check out the racism there. Lots for you to see.

128 2018-12-12 23:45:32 Corrupt for years! @JimInhofe famous for climate change denial when the oil industry wanted him to #snowball
129 2018-12-12 23:45:24 So pass a law to get rid of gas vehicles and make them all electric. Why aren't school buses electric or ladot transportation electric? If you cared these are the steps you would take but no too much money in oil

135 2018-12-12 23:45:02 The 150b also included frozen contracts for Iranian oil include dozens of tankards that were sitting in various ports.
136 2018-12-12 23:44:58 Nissan gave me my oil change for free, saved me $35 
137 2018-12-12 23:44:58 I only use Vaseline or baby oil on my body  no lotion unless I'm ashy btwn shifts
138 2018-12-12 23:44:38 I don't know what it would take to get tarasenko. But if the oil could do it without giving up drai or nuge, their top 6 would be ridiculous

140 2018-12-12 23:44:30 #ThingsOcasioCortezThinks  .If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
141 2018-12-12 23:44:28 All I’m saying is if their is a section of the population that doesn’t like AB oil and gas and the money it contributes to the rest of Canada they should make a statement and decline the money. We know how much each province contributes.
142 2018-12-12 23:44:13 No problem. I felt guilty cuz I told ya to wait until day two to buy!  I had to get some too. This looks like a great holiday treat for someone who has been burning the midnight oil to get a book done...
143 2018-12-12 23:44:10 Sucks getting crude/fuel oil on you 
144 2018-12-12 23:43:56 The Implications aren't enough for Trump. 
The Saudi outcome inafect will Bring Oil To The Highest Energy Prices For Americans.
RECESSION.
STOCKS WILL FALL. SELL OFF TIME,LAY OFFS THIS NEW YEAR AND AMERICANS WILL MOST LIKELY HOME INTERESTS RISE TO ALL TIME HIGH.
145 2018-12-12 23:43:47 The knife work (not gonna mention the pink trimmed camo) is pretty offensive.
146 2018-12-12 23:43:46 Tea tree oil! My goodness I’d never experienced dry and itchy nipples and especially in the cold. It’s my go to. Let it air dry so it moisturizes and doesn’t ruin your clothes.
147 2018-12-12 23:43:34 Dude it’s affecting the oil industry in the Arctic. They’re having to plan for it, some of these projects have lifetimes up to 80 years.
148 2018-12-12 23:43:32 Send equalization payments in barrels of oil.
149 2018-12-12 23:43:28 No motor oil? No problem! Mayonnaise has the same viscosity as most common motor oils and will emit a delicious potato salad smell when you drive #carcare

151 2018-12-12 23:43:10 Hmmm - maybe her views on palm oil? Because surely the colour of your skin can’t be controversial can it?
152 2018-12-12 23:43:09 Cari yang sesuai kebutuhan mau brightening, moisture, atau oil control wkwk. Terus karena aku dry skin, pas make ngga ketarik, dan lembab yaudah berati cocok wkwk
153 2018-12-12 23:43:03 ok but imagine this: a diffuser but instead of using essential oils you use extra virgin olive oil
154 2018-12-12 23:43:00 This is a good point - tomatoes are from the New World and didn't become a part of Italian cuisine until the 16th-17th (or later). If there was something like pizza before that time, it would have been bread, olive oil and cheese.
155 2018-12-12 23:42:48 It wasn't "given".  The United States, using pressure, froze Iranian bank accounts, and sanctioned materials, and oil tankards that were already contract sold.
156 2018-12-12 23:42:43 I NEED MORE NAIL OIL PENS
157 2018-12-12 23:42:41 I'm a real dummy but what do you DO with CBD oil?
158 2018-12-12 23:42:20 Also "if you weren't for the KSA , you would be speaking russian "

You forgot what the boycut of our oil to your country did ? Read the history .
159 2018-12-12 23:42:12 In 1972 we realised we needed to be in Europe because we had no oil because of Iran & the rest of the M East stopped us nicking it - as I keep saying N Sea oil saved the UK, now it’s all gone & Thatcher destroyed all our manufacturing to concentrate on bankers & assembling cars
160 2018-12-12 23:42:09 Did a hair mask with beech nut banana baby food (yes baby food), honey and jamaican black castor oil.....
161 2018-12-12 23:42:09 You ever put CBD oil in your preworkout? Yeah idk we’re in for a wild ride
162 2018-12-12 23:42:03 Large merlot top left - understandable.

Is that a recipe book - for Marks and Spencer microwave chilli - top right of the plate ?  Far less understandable.  

Or even an oil painting of a stuffed poussin and a preserved lemon ?  Less comprehensible still...
163 2018-12-12 23:42:01 i got some random CBD oil off of ebay that is literally vegetable oil and glycerin and CBD and it was AMAZING, completely got rid of my period cramps... and i’ve gone to buy more, and the shop is no longer on ebay 
164 2018-12-12 23:41:59 Whenever I cook, I always tell myself that I’ll twist the feet of the stove to level it so the oil isn’t always on one side of the pan, but I never remember to do it after I eat smh
165 2018-12-12 23:41:51 ... of of Federally owned land and waters (means of production).... which make up over 70% of America.

Taxes pay for hundreds of millions of their subsidies, the roads they use and destroy which require maintenance, the coast guard and EPA that have to clean up oil spills,... 3/
166 2018-12-12 23:41:49 Make a hybrid oil, million dollar idea
167 2018-12-12 23:41:49 This is the stupidest “scandal” ever. Lots of Texans work in the oil and gas industries. Many of them are Democrats who are allowed to support the candidates of their choice with their perfectly legal personal contributions. #Beto2020
168 2018-12-12 23:41:42 Restocking on foundation, brow pencil, mascara, etc gives me the same satisfaction/excitement as an oil change: none. Just spending money so shit can continue running smoothly
169 2018-12-12 23:41:35 Or simply have the Alberta gov’t buy a partnership in a Houston area oil shipping network and use the keystone xl that’s being built.
170 2018-12-12 23:41:32 And i haven't brought our oil into it regardless that would add more even at its lowest price we profit billions from that too. But hard to get accurate figure's since it's filtered in offshore accounts and tax havens for the UK government.
171 2018-12-12 23:41:25 You are the worst snake oil salesman ever.
172 2018-12-12 23:41:19 No, She’ll doesn’t own 55%, but they do own a boat load of Oil.  So why isn’t Oil considered a security.  XRP fits this analogy perfectly!
173 2018-12-12 23:41:02 Thinking you can pick a team and beat the bad guy(s) is an obvious trap. E.g. climate change. Some morons deny it. Bad. Some hardly better ppl go alarmist w/o specifics. 80% of energy still comes from oil, gas & coal - what's the solution?  Deindustrialize? Nuance is important!
174 2018-12-12 23:40:52 none the less its a good day that a great game series is being recognized that's very important. If the game is carefully done they may have another classic. Especially if they decide to use the art of the series as the graphics that would be a oil painting of a gift!
175 2018-12-12 23:40:50 Hey - thanks for the oil
176 2018-12-12 23:40:15 This comment sounds like it was written by a sentient oil barrel
177 2018-12-12 23:40:14 If this is any sign, oil purchase will be “bigly”, might sustain exports over 3000
178 2018-12-12 23:40:11 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。

199 2018-12-12 23:37:51 .... and AOC are, I guess, on the right. Strange how that works.

Now, using your same definition of Socialism, why don't you look at how much money Big Oil lobby Republicans with. Why? So they can keep their production costs to a minimum and profits way up extracting oil... 2/
200 2018-12-12 23:37:48 My friend Dave has lung cancer. He has access to THC oil or caniboid oil or whatever. In California it’s legal anyway. Can he send me a cookie?  I’m thinking no, until we pass laws legalizing it. He’s 66 years old with cancer. WTF are they going to do?
201 2018-12-12 23:37:42 Sure.  Just as long as they don’t travel to Saudi. But hey, let keep importing oil from this country.
202 2018-12-12 23:37:16 Oh my.  Well, I know some senior citizens who are so desperate for pain-relieving hemp oil that they are looking into brewing it themselves....
203 2018-12-12 23:37:11 But there is social acceptability for everyone else’s oil?  While American oil companies have supported anti Alberta oil campaigns the never mention the oil produced around Los Angeles which is very dirty oil
204 2018-12-12 23:37:02 Fun fact: I like really good olive oil
205 2018-12-12 23:36:55 Horace and Dickies DC on Eastern ave is real but we don’t have mice that eat the tops off tartar sauce or go to sleep in the bread or keep using dirty oil they have roaches  they spray off the stainless steel wall over the sink and they fall on the fish look around h st ne store
206 2018-12-12 23:36:54 Coal sounds real green to you, since it’s not from Alberta, you do realize that oil is a lot more than just fuel, but it’s used in pretty much everything we make

214 2018-12-12 23:36:09 You can make very - in the area of low single digits - low carb bread using nut-based flours, usually coconut or almond. You also add oil, some recipes add a bit of milk, etcetera - the low-carb cooking community's come up with a lot of wild shit to replace staple foods.
215 2018-12-12 23:36:07 Meat free mince is very versatile - you can even make pasties with them. You can make great things with basic flour, olive oil, water and yeast. Coconut cream is another basic - for cakes, desserts and curries (lentils & cauliflower a favourite). Also try  @vegancook101.

224 2018-12-12 23:34:44 i asked this to a hemp industry lawyer who was trying to convince me that cbd oil was legal because it was derived from legal hemp. he was befuddled and fell back on the idea that it would be impracticable (which is fair), but i still think it's a legitimate question.

228 2018-12-12 23:34:35 It's impossible, not including the oil Scotland provides surplus. the UK overcharging us for defence when it barely costs millions with hardly any in scotland or in our borders and our EU membership doesn't come anywhere near what the UK say it costs us they are stealing from us.
229 2018-12-12 23:34:33 What's it called when you oppose something on principles even though it might be against your own interests? Oh yeah Moral high ground Moe is in the muck with oil industry The opposite of moral ground #skpoli #SustainableDevelopment

230 2018-12-12 23:34:30 Need some big oil buying reports.
231 2018-12-12 23:34:28 Furthermore, Alberta happens to have oil under its feet, while BC and Maritimes happen to have tidewater access. Why should Alberta alone reap the benefits of their oil when they need tidewater and pipelines that pass through other provinces in order to fully exploit it?
232 2018-12-12 23:34:26 No.  Quebeckers (the taxpayers) hurt for both Quebec (cream harvest) and buying Alberta oil.  At least give us the discount you give to Americans.
233 2018-12-12 23:34:18 I worked in 'oil'. Call when you are about 1/4 tank. One bad storm and you are a week behind. Also, *cough* if you tilt it a bit, you can keep it running*I said nothing*

237 2018-12-12 23:33:46 Our relationship with #KSA is not based solely on "oil". Sen. Graham needs a crash course on our historic relationship and the continued benefits of working with a strategic partner in the ME.
238 2018-12-12 23:33:40 Ever watched the movie This Christmas? Remember the scene with the baby oil? Use “the whole damn bottle.” 
239 2018-12-12 23:33:39 All electricity enthusiasts don't realize that half the world's electricity is made from hydrocarbons. Once demand for EVs skyrockets, demand for oil and natural gas by power stations will also skyrocket. EVs are NOT the death of the oil industry. They are just a step

246 2018-12-12 23:32:49 As someone who loves Canada but lives in Ontario I fully support your desire to separate.  You’re never going to get a fair deal with the @liberal_party in power. They are intent on stomping on you while you’re suffering with low oil prices.
247 2018-12-12 23:32:35 I see she has those invasive palm trees taking up the habitat of native trees and plants.  also note that Palms trees with their high oil content are a fire hazard and the burning fronds embers spread the fire to miles away.
248 2018-12-12 23:32:25 My mom is buying my brother cbd oil for Christmas and said the word shit and me and my siblings are definitely a bad (good) influence on her
249 2018-12-12 23:32:15 Anybody else have these new essential oil diffusers at work? What do y’all think of those two most common ones? One I think is called Rotting Daisies and another that seems to be called Rancid Oranges.
250 2018-12-12 23:32:12 Looks YUM! Sorry you’re sad. 
If you really think too much yoghurt, make up a little masala in a saucepan (oil, garli, onions, spices) & add it in. Problem solved. But personally, I think you can hardly have too much tang :)

253 2018-12-12 23:31:51 Shouldn’t have storage on an exchange in the first place. The very true meanings of those two words are oil and water.

255 2018-12-12 23:31:43 A lot of olive oil is diluted with rapseed oil too....

From the POV of the store, who cares! It moved before it got rancid.

258 2018-12-12 23:31:28 13 is best. Oil and vinegar on the side. Along with the hot relish.
259 2018-12-12 23:31:24 OLIVE OIL??
260 2018-12-12 23:31:09 Virgin olive oil for dressing & normal for cooking. Garlic & herbs. We love oat milk, Violife cheases, Swedish Glace ice creams. Tesco, Waitrose & Asda have great choice of vegan products. Lentils, chick peas and mixed beans alongside rice and couscous are cupboard standards.
261 2018-12-12 23:30:59 @jkenney 
Quebec doesn't care about oil sands. They want Alberta money. 
Federal government should focus in getting pipelines. @JustinTrudeau should work harder in getting pipelines. Alberta economy is bad. Soon more lay offs are coming. Energy companies can't make any money.
262 2018-12-12 23:30:55 @marketcall is there any stock that is  transitioning to renewable energy? Like a oil company going to the solar sector.

268 2018-12-12 23:30:13 So, what changes for AB? Nothing. We’re still selling oil $20. Now, take away the oil East & west and you’ll see $4.00 to $5.00 a litre for gas. What about NG? AB produces 80% how about heating homes, now add terrifs to every thing east & west, don’t forget 22B in equalization
269 2018-12-12 23:30:12 This money was frozen assets of Iran. It was not US money, little was in US banks most was in banks overseas! Just like Iraq’s oil is their countries! You could pay back govt the 72 million it cost for your golfing during presidency we could use for border security?

275 2018-12-12 23:29:46 We have the cleanest oil energy in the world why not respect that.  Your four fathers would flip with your uninformed attitude with all the hard work they had done to give you what you have.
276 2018-12-12 23:29:33 Current items on our wish list:   new washcloths, preferably white, for cleaning tables in the dining room and kitchen; white sugar, preferably in 10 or 25 lb bags; and vegetable oil for cooking on our flat top grills!  If you can help, drop off between 9am and 3pm!

280 2018-12-12 23:29:20 Mindfulness practices and CBD oil have been life savers for me. My anxiety was also at levels requiring medical attention. We gotta get our stress levels down. I know you can do it.
281 2018-12-12 23:29:20 I mix up an oil combination (jojoba, neem, lavender), apply it directly to my scalp, and massage it in before I wash my hair.

I also dilute lavender oil in water and spray my hair before bed.

Both things have helped me drastically!

283 2018-12-12 23:28:57 I’ve been having an allergic reaction either to Eucalyptus oil or budding happiness this past few days
284 2018-12-12 23:28:47 maybe someone should remind jack what happened to Ma Bell and standard oil
285 2018-12-12 23:28:40 Finally, the tip of the spear, my fat hair..  More like the puppet on the string, next the oil and coal consortiums
286 2018-12-12 23:28:37 "No, your Honor, it isn't marijuana. I took the time to harvest an acre of hemp and used dangerous, expensive extraction technologies to convert its trace THC content into 22 grams of hash oil," said the guy who is convicted anyway for possessing Schedule I cannabis products.

288 2018-12-12 23:28:27 Oil rag?
What's that about then?
289 2018-12-12 23:28:26 The one SNAP “cheat” I have seen is getting sugar/olive oil and adding essential oils to make body scrubs to upsell to people. Which I think is honestly entrepreneurial brilliance and should be allowed.
290 2018-12-12 23:28:24 Not really an oil rich or natural gas rich area here...
291 2018-12-12 23:28:18 i hate getting oil changes.
292 2018-12-12 23:28:15 Jeep 4.0 next please! I really need to do a compression check and figure out this oil blow by
293 2018-12-12 23:28:05 New brakes, new tires, new oil, new windshield wipers. God, cars are expensive.

300 2018-12-12 23:27:16 They are? Terrorists are coming through the Mexican border? You have any proof of that Linda? Or are we using Trump logic, where whatever we want to believe is true. I know Terrorists have come from Saudi Arabia, but they sell us oil....so they get a free pass.
301 2018-12-12 23:26:53 A messanger said an executive said "Madonna must use coconut oil or something with coconut in her hair, because that's what it smells like when she passed by" 

I'll take that as a compliment.

304 2018-12-12 23:26:11 CO2 is not a self replicating bacteria, it is just a gas.

Oil production has broken world records and consumption is increasing by 1.5m bpd, per year, fossil fuel is becoming more entrenched, not being uprooted.

The point was totally offsetting CO2 with greening of arid lands.
305 2018-12-12 23:26:07 my car fr needs an oil change women aint shit
306 2018-12-12 23:26:01 My friend got dropped last minute, no explanation nothing. In fear of that, I asked mine to tell her parents that my parents are coming for intro, she said they won't hear of it. I moved on & got 1 whom I sent my parents to. Now she's saying I betrayed her
307 2018-12-12 23:25:53 White people use their oil to fry food one time and then throw out the leftover grease like it’s not still good for another 7 uses

313 2018-12-12 23:25:12 You mean for oil that's the only reason the west went into the middle East.  Yes please do back out and leave us to defend our own country as pretty sure you're not protecting us from an invasion from anyone anyway so sure we will be ok

316 2018-12-12 23:24:39 We'll find him and send him back. Just have to follow the oil slick.
317 2018-12-12 23:24:36 This isn’t about pesticides, it’s about using glyphosate, which is a plant growth-hormone inhibitor in an oil suspension, being used around schools / houses.
318 2018-12-12 23:24:33 yep her car could be chilling now she gotta get more oil changes then she needed.... and if she dont smoke weed thats extra
319 2018-12-12 23:24:32 They bought a pipeline and did not, despite an election promise, stop subsidizing oil and gas, and effectively exempted the oil sands from carbon pricing.

321 2018-12-12 23:24:12 Ummmm we import oil to Eastern Canada from Saudi Arabia when we could have built energy east and used local Canadian oil..... what’s the difference 
322 2018-12-12 23:24:02 Specifically ppl who can put coconut oil on their faces. Ridiculous bunch.

324 2018-12-12 23:23:55 i find it's helpful to chop all of your elements the same size. watch the amount of oil used. toast your pecans and then keep the layers thin. it all sort of melts together that way.

328 2018-12-12 23:23:26 I think that an analogous situation might be seen in Portugal with its relationship with Angola. When oil was reaching record prices, Angolan investors raided the Portuguese media companies and pushed them to tone down the criticism of the Dos Santos regime...
329 2018-12-12 23:23:22 *walks into cold stone*

330 2018-12-12 23:23:13 The real issue is Big Oil $$$ and resentment towards these "elites". Letting the world burn to own the libs!
331 2018-12-12 23:23:12 So I’m FaceTiming my fiancé @Walmart trying to find her sun tan oil. She keeps telling me to look around and I find it. We hang up. As I look up, I realize I am lost with a wall of tampons and essential oils closing in. But like a ray of sunshine I see the hunting section sign
332 2018-12-12 23:23:11 Add diced 1 onion, 2 celery stalks, 2 carrot (same size dice) to yr largest saucepan and saute in oil if u have, water if not. Add 1 cup adzuki beans raw (don't have to soak) 4 cups water, vege stock cube, 1 can tomatoes and bring to boil then simmer

337 2018-12-12 23:22:18 A new refinery opened in Alberta last year, the Sturgeon refinery near Edmonton, right now turning heavy oil into diesel, eventually will use Alberta govt royalty in kind bitumen as feedstock 80k barrels/day
338 2018-12-12 23:22:18 Your industry will not stop at anything in pursuit of the enormous profits you seek. There is no Planet B. Strip mining, fracking, oil spills, climate change, all for the love of money.

340 2018-12-12 23:22:00 Oh, yeh, and I’m finally getting my oil change
341 2018-12-12 23:21:56 Oil heater?
342 2018-12-12 23:21:54 I'm starting to get it. If the brits left and let you all get on with it, you'd find your own peace, wouldn't you. Water finds it's own level. But when mixed with oil... I still find it hard to believe religion is so much of an issue when brits in uk are no longer religious lol.

344 2018-12-12 23:21:45 Coconut oil n time
345 2018-12-12 23:21:30 That's the whole point, you idiot. Eastern Canada has to import foreign oil because Alberta has been too lazy and/or stupid to build oil refineries. You can't blame the East for not wanting to be polluted by Alberta bitumen. No one is objecting to refined oil pipelines. #cdnpoli

351 2018-12-12 23:20:59 That's because he & many others are oil & coal lobbyist.

Which cares nothing for humanity just their profit and lose columns, no matter what harm
352 2018-12-12 23:20:54 tell big oil to give up some of the oppressed fuel patents....go back to buses...more glass containers...no plastic containers ....much can be done to help the EARTH past oppressing the populous for needing energy

362 2018-12-12 23:19:47 hemp seed oil is among the healthiest cooking oils with an incredibly high smoke point
363 2018-12-12 23:19:41 We should only buy product that can be verified as being sustainable & causes minimal negative effect on ecosystems wildlife, & the environment generally, so in respect of that I can add qualified support for Palm Oil, but not where this ethos is abandoned. Clearer?
364 2018-12-12 23:19:40 ‘Dirty oil’ revenues are included in the formula while hydro revenues are not. Quebec has received over 50% of equalization payments since 1957. Equalization needs to be reformed or scrapped

367 2018-12-12 23:19:25 We are a fairly small island & all our resources have gone - Thatcher sold off all our industries & plundered our oil & has for tax cuts. Norway used theirs wisely & invested in their industries - they are rich we are poor - we had a great deal with the Eu & leave lost it all

378 2018-12-12 23:18:17 I haven’t gotten an oil change in a year and I’m just waiting for my car to blow up at this point
379 2018-12-12 23:18:16 How is the oil doing at the minute? What £30billion? What imaginary defences?
380 2018-12-12 23:18:09 Also Dems: Lets run the Texas guy who takes money from oil executives. 
381 2018-12-12 23:17:56 Perhaps the price change has more to do with International oil prices dropping 30% since early October? The WTI Oil price has plunged from US$76 to US$51 per barrel, while the Brent Crude index has followed a similar pattern since October.
382 2018-12-12 23:17:56 It’s easy lol wake up and go, no brush no comb lmao just some oil

391 2018-12-12 23:16:59 I feel really bad for you guys. I know you’re just paid to be the mouthpiece of Big Oil. 

Still, did you seriously think #oil is a trending hashtag? What about #soap or #wood or #air ?

Or maybe #blood
392 2018-12-12 23:16:57 If you’re a girl and you reading this rn .... go get that mf oil changed you’ve seen the light on for months.
393 2018-12-12 23:16:57 Yeah I believe this happened in Iraq, we sold them weapons to fight Russia in the 60s and 70s and they are still using them on us. These people have had sect wars for centuries and we do not belong there in the middle of it. It’s all about the money “OIL”

I really only have a few drum fills that I use. Just variations of eachother.  And as long as you don't over so fills they never get old.
406 2018-12-12 23:14:11 All of them.
407 2018-12-12 23:14:05 Wind and solar are energy loss systems when applied as they are subsidised each dollar unit being = unit of energy, the more dollar units per kilowatt the more currency needs to be borrowed from out side energy systems using coal and oil, it is a false approach to the problem.

411 2018-12-12 23:13:25 Fact: The easily found and retrieved oil is a shrinking share of US petroleum mining, leading to offshore, arctic, fracking, etc. 
Fact: Coal is giving you a preview of your future. 
Fact: The end of the stone age was not the result of a rock shortage.

413 2018-12-12 23:13:12 lrt sorry that still absolutely puts oil in the tank sorry
414 2018-12-12 23:13:11 I reckon it would be something like Pomp and Circumstance but Randy Savage would spin in his grave so hard he'd strike oil.
415 2018-12-12 23:12:48 I got this strong wiff of cinnamon and peppermint so I poked my head out of my lab to see where it was coming from. I snuffled around trying to find where it was until I spotted a kart with a very distinct purse sitting in it, no one in sight.

This purse belongs to the oil woman

417 2018-12-12 23:12:43 At the very least it takes shampoo, conditioner, and it's not a popular opinion but I like jojoba oil.
418 2018-12-12 23:12:38 Exploring more unspoiled, beautiful places to sell off for oil and fracking rights.
419 2018-12-12 23:12:27 They need attention, a little bit of oil and a gentle touch.

423 2018-12-12 23:11:56 Made a red beet salad with orange, pomegranate, blueberries, lime, olive oil and kosher salt. I couldn’t get an aesthetically pleasing photo, but it was quite delicious 
424 2018-12-12 23:11:40 Hey we're selling CBD oil at my Family Video now, just in case you were wondering where the weirdest possible place to buy CBD oil would be
425 2018-12-12 23:11:28 We have reached peak animal. How many more billions do we have to kill before we stop? We are legislating more fuel efficient vehicles, more efficient industries.  It's time to start reducing animal agriculture. Oil production does not torture and kill. Animal agriculture does.
426 2018-12-12 23:11:12 that's not fair

they also tried lavender oil
427 2018-12-12 23:11:08 You know he's taken more money from oil & gas than anyone in Congress except Cruz?
428 2018-12-12 23:11:06 Yes, oil and gas uses it extensively for isolation as well.
429 2018-12-12 23:11:05 So if high reserves are not as a result of new ideas, hwy then did GEJ you said you supported DEPLETED our reserve when oil was twice what Buhari is using to increase thay same reserve now?
If Npower, tradermoni are all old ideas, Feb 2019 will clarify which idea Nigerians want.

433 2018-12-12 23:10:53 I dont think we are quite ready or can afford to right now....abandon oil that is.
434 2018-12-12 23:10:48 Cooked cod liver oil? That, is a crime in itself!! Is that for eating, or stinking up a room... forever!!
435 2018-12-12 23:10:42 African mum, never disappointing. I remember my mum used Goya oil on a cockroach in her room.

437 2018-12-12 23:10:21 Thank you @VIA_Rail for NOT giving this contract to @Bombardier in #Quebec 
They won’t support the oil industry in #Alberta so we have NO support for anything they do while taking #Equalization  & hypocritically blocking #energyeast & pipelines to get fair market $ for oil
438 2018-12-12 23:10:19 My only small criticism is too much hair oil.

440 2018-12-12 23:10:12 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this December? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

442 2018-12-12 23:09:49 Yes that’s what I use too and also coconut oil
443 2018-12-12 23:09:33 Pretty sure the guy 
lobbying secretly for the Turkish govt, 
and arranging secret SA oil deals, 
and back channeling with Russia,

knows when & who he should lie to
in order to keep it all on-going.

448 2018-12-12 23:08:56 Last day in Aberdeen on a Windows 10 deployment project for an oil company tomorrow. Absolutely loved it. Worked with lovely people, had amazing feedback and loved the variety of the role. 

Hope 2019 brings more fantastic contracts. International travel would be good .
449 2018-12-12 23:08:48 He really hates those oil cans.
450 2018-12-12 23:08:36 Unfortunately, Rees-Mogg's manservant got the ratio of coal dust to walnut oil wrong while filling his inkwell, leading to illegible quill work. He's been dispatched to the apothecary to procure some oak galls to enhance the mix.
451 2018-12-12 23:08:28 Is it weird that for Christmas I want an oil change?
452 2018-12-12 23:08:24 Ahh this cream and oil were a good idea, my feet look so pretty 
453 2018-12-12 23:08:17 BITCH
Cologne is 2-4% scented oil

Parfum is 15-20% scented oil
454 2018-12-12 23:08:05 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
455 2018-12-12 23:07:53 Lol the Japanese wanted to bomb America into selling them oil. FDR didn’t owe them oil and that’s not a provocation
456 2018-12-12 23:07:50 I just realized strip poles (or whatever they are called) spin. I thought the dancers spun around the pole, like they put oil on their hands or sth.
I'm 23.
457 2018-12-12 23:07:47 Chief just called in. He confirms that THIS? Is definitely not it.
458 2018-12-12 23:07:32 Yes dipshit he does think your dumb.  As a matter of fact he knows you are.  Your worried about a ridiculous wall, when he's committed collusion and treason, with a consistently attacking nation!  Which invaded an other nation, farther breaking down NATO's resolve helped by  oil
459 2018-12-12 23:07:08 We nicked everything else from  the common”wealth” we sold all our industries, our car makers and then we sold our electricity, water and gas utilities - we have been living in North Sea oil and taxes for the past 40 years & it’s running out fast- what else have we got?
460 2018-12-12 23:06:58 Correction: they attack corporatist democrats who, like republicans, take $$ from the oil, fossil fuel & big pharma industries & then crafting US policies to benefit those industries
If we want those industries to have less power in DC, we cannot be afraid to call out politicians
461 2018-12-12 23:06:50 Efficascent Oil daw sabi ni Sir, san daw nakuha yung Aciete. HAHAHAHA, qt! 
462 2018-12-12 23:06:48 Why would US spend any money on making a devastated country pliable to its energy needs? Maduro & brainless zombies in his admin. destroyed oil industry. It’d cost billions of $ to make it viable again. Fracking at home is cheaper. Not condoning US imperialism just pointing@ fact

464 2018-12-12 23:06:18 Found an invoice from oil company the other day, kerosene per litre was 38 cent in 2005! My invoice last week was 71 cent per litre.
465 2018-12-12 23:06:14 Like uncle Bird use to call it. "I gotta change my damn oil"
466 2018-12-12 23:06:08 I want the sound of garlic sauteing in olive oil.

469 2018-12-12 23:05:40 I am ashamed. I would like to apologize on behalf of all the people of quebec who feel that we need canadian oil.

471 2018-12-12 23:05:21 Tweets vs actions....@RachelNotley has no plans to help our oil and gas sector. She is well aware that election is nearing and she still has a full anti oil party.  @albertaNDP need to be ousted yesterday
472 2018-12-12 23:05:20 They've been playing carols outside my office window for about a half hour and so when did we stop pouring boiling oil on our enemies from great heights?

476 2018-12-12 23:04:40 Then don't make the promise. Or return the donations that were above the $200 limit and ask them to resubmit at the lower amount. 

I recognize how large of an employer Oil & Gas is in Texas, but he knew that going in and took this pledge anyway.
477 2018-12-12 23:04:09 The snake oil salesman is still trying to sell his poison....don’t let Don get away with that Senator!
478 2018-12-12 23:04:02 Newer cars have synthetic oil so it is not necessary to warm em up. I still do because Im not trying to get hypothermia whilst driving.
479 2018-12-12 23:04:01 Yep!
Control of natural resources!  Especially oil & natural gas!
Control the fuel... Control the populations...  Control the $$$

481 2018-12-12 23:03:55 We're taking Whisky, food, oil & gas with us.

So what else are you going to sell apart from the NHS?
482 2018-12-12 23:03:52 Baby paid for my gas and a oil change??? My baby wants some NEEECKK
483 2018-12-12 23:03:49 Wait, so non virgin olive oil HAS been used in a magical ritual?
484 2018-12-12 23:03:18 that fade in oil intra day was something else $USO
485 2018-12-12 23:03:15 "President Donald Trump had been using Twitter this month first to express hope that Saudi Arabia and OPEC won’t cut production to prop up oil prices, then to thank Saudi Arabia for the lower oil prices"
486 2018-12-12 23:03:01 Yes very true, oil, gas, steel, coal ..... how much have you got left?
487 2018-12-12 23:03:00 i'm so genuinely exhausted at this point that i'm running on 2 grams of sugar and a gallon of motor oil
488 2018-12-12 23:02:46 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
489 2018-12-12 23:02:39 Fun fact for those wondering; the whole "virgin blood" thing means someone whose blood was never used in a magical ritual before. It has nothing to do with sex (see also; virgin olive oil)

492 2018-12-12 23:02:14 if we start killing Saudi royalty, they will cut off our oil imports and crash our economy. the journalist was putting a report together that he knew was dangerous and if some one found out what he was doing while in Saudi - might just cost him his life,and that is what happened

495 2018-12-12 23:02:05 .@maitlis great work tonight on the @BBCNewsnight interview with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg - exposed him for what he is, a charlaton snake oil salesman who's only motivation is self advancement. An excellent interview with fabulous zoom work by your camera operator. #Newsnight #Brexit
496 2018-12-12 23:02:03 @thespybrief @gametheorytoday @LincolnsBible random thought...mob like natural resources- diamonds, oil, potash, aluminum, right? Rescue efforts of Fight 370 included mapped Indian Ocean sea floor. Any connection? What about the two MH planes? What is Malaysia connection?
497 2018-12-12 23:02:00 Holy fuck the people of south carolina need to get it together. How do you vote for this dumbfuck? He flips his stance 40 times a day and lives in trump's false reality. How do people buy this shit?? This is beyond "buying into snake oil" this is gladly buying the snake's shit.
498 2018-12-12 23:01:44 actually, sex is the end result. for fore-foreplay, i was thinking of me, and a few naked people (and a BIG bottle of coconut oil), playing twister. between rounds, quarters with vodka (or whatever); more oil... it's plastic, right? ...what..? :P

500 2018-12-12 23:01:32 The fire seems odd to me. It appears isolated on a flat roof. And then with heavy black smoke like diesel oil burning with raging flames. 

What the heck could be on a roof of an office building that would burn like that?  

Air conditioning units?
501 2018-12-12 23:01:32 Convinced me to eat Chinese food at an oil change place
502 2018-12-12 23:01:23 Oil is dead.

503 2018-12-12 23:01:22 When to get a oil change & endend up needing a tire  I was so sad some really nice guy paid half and the mechanic paid for the rest  small blessings
504 2018-12-12 23:01:19 Incorrect. We are facing planetary death because of putting carbon into the atmosphere. ground level pollution is deadly but not approaching extinction level yet. You believe oil extraction is cleaner than lithium & copper? Just the methane releases from oil extraction is worse.
505 2018-12-12 23:01:18 Natural remedies for irritable bowel syndrome could help you to improve your overall digestive health. Peppermint oil is shown to reduce abdominal pain and chamomile has been associated with helping alleviate symptoms of diarrhea.
506 2018-12-12 23:01:10 Some home remedies you can use to get rid of plantar warts include duct tape peels, placing onions in your socks, and scrubbing them with tea tree oil.

Plenty of sound bites, plenty of rhetoric, plenty of joingistic claptrap.

But no plans, no alternatives, no idea.

525 2018-12-12 22:58:06 Iran (Mossadegh), Chile (Allende), countless other leaders, politicians would testify to US assassinations, regime changes.

536 2018-12-12 22:57:00 @JustinTrudeau is on record for saying the problem with Canada is Alberta, and that he is going to phase out Canadian Energy, and in Paris, said if he could, he would shut down the oil sands today. @liberal_party cant refuse that Alberta is being alienated by their leader.
537 2018-12-12 22:57:00 It’s a far bigger inconvenience to AB. You’ll pump oil south to the guy who wants $20 a barrel?

547 2018-12-12 22:55:04 It's good to know that when the oil runs out the economy will revert to the stone age. I exaggerated the iron age. Why is the idea of clean renewable energy so scary to you? Evangelical Christians are supposed to be stewards of God's earth not ravaging locusts.

549 2018-12-12 22:55:00 Seriously, can't we tank oil demand ourselves? Avoid driving if possible. Go out and buy the last of the small cars. Turn down our thermostats. 
We need to destroy the demand for oil from Alaska.
550 2018-12-12 22:54:58 Two questions. 1. What percent of oil consumption consists of transportation? 2. How many major automakers have announced plans to end production of internal combustion engines?
551 2018-12-12 22:54:54 She cares about the next election..then this reaction to oil will wane..give your head a shake.
552 2018-12-12 22:54:53 Yea until we run outta oil ..then we won’t need signs
553 2018-12-12 22:54:32 I just wish people would stop buying it for me, beard oil,beard wax,beard shampoos as a gift, just buy me cider FFS
554 2018-12-12 22:54:30 Before I dumped it out, I found 3 UFO's (unidentified floating objects) in the water, and when I poured it out, it was like used 40 weight oil. All the concentrate of THC and CBD cascading down the pipes at horrifying speeds with a doomed henchmouse looking frozen at it
555 2018-12-12 22:54:29 That was an unfortunate question. Safer by far to have asked about the whereabouts of Lake Olive Oil or Lake Milk, or, indeed, asked direction to Beef Mountain and Butter Mountain.
556 2018-12-12 22:54:29 Why could oil not be piped to Thunder Bay and tankered by ship to Saint John for Refining? Oil is already tankered up the Seaway through Quebec to Montreal. #pnpcbc
557 2018-12-12 22:54:25 Oil dey my head oh!!!
558 2018-12-12 22:54:24 Eu fiquei coçando mas usei um óleo muito bom o nome dele é Bio Oil vende na farmácia
559 2018-12-12 22:54:17 "The Nation that destroys its soil destroys itself" FDR. We have to stop using chemicals on our lands. And why do we use oil for fuel to grow corn to make into fuel? #makesnosense We need to follow Nature's model and we will succeed! #give2receive
560 2018-12-12 22:54:15 おはようごさいます
561 2018-12-12 22:54:14 Perhaps the ANCHOR SPA needed to be rescinded...but it should have been done properly and NOT via public Ad Com and "mineral oil" issue fabrication.  Professional Societies have a responsibility to act if FDA/CMS doesn't follow or places barriers to standards of care.
562 2018-12-12 22:54:08 having oil poured on you will have you feeling like a turkey getting baste lmao
563 2018-12-12 22:54:03 She covers the oil patch, particularly Venezuela. Lula was jailed by a court order!
564 2018-12-12 22:53:51 In 1911, the Government via Courst broke up Standard Oil. Time to reprise that for Google. 

#BreakItUp.
565 2018-12-12 22:53:49 bouta give my car an oil change
566 2018-12-12 22:53:41 Well, I lick mom's face too, but she smart & knows that my way of telling her I want one of my special treats. Then I give her *big* kissies at bedtime 'cause she puts coconut oil on her hand & arms & it is *yummy* & is very good for doggos!
567 2018-12-12 22:53:32 Haha if a millennial is concerned with oil they aren’t a millennial. I dig the list though. 
568 2018-12-12 22:53:08 Lord, pour your oil on me, let it fall down on me
569 2018-12-12 22:53:05 The oil I use is called "breathe easier". I put 8 drops of it in my diffuser and turn it one right next to my bed. It is wonderful.
570 2018-12-12 22:53:03 my girlfriend from Venezuela was born in 77

As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement."
571 2018-12-12 22:52:38 Energy East wouldn’t serve domestic markets. And if you think that Eastern Canada would use Alberta oil, you’d be demanding that Alberta accept a $10/barrel discount. Honestly. Stop paying attention to these hucksters and call them out. #PnPCBC
572 2018-12-12 22:52:36 A delicious habanero oil for my tacos.
573 2018-12-12 22:52:28 I hear there’s oil in the Intercoastal by Palm Beach! Drill Baby Drill
574 2018-12-12 22:52:28 What will you trade? No oil, no steel, no coal! Car industry moving jobs out, bankers moving to Europe? We had to go to the imf the last time we had no oil luckily we found North Sea oil - last dregs now
575 2018-12-12 22:52:16 Same here. The way to reduce oil production is to reduce consumption. I rather it be Canadian oil in the meantime for obvious reasons. We are tapping into wind and other methods of production but as you know, oil is more than just fuel.
576 2018-12-12 22:52:10 Slap a coexist sticker on that oil rig, baby, he’s running
577 2018-12-12 22:52:07 Fantastic
578 2018-12-12 22:52:06 Build a refinery for Alberta so we can stop buying oil from murderers
579 2018-12-12 22:52:03 Firstly that's you're insinuating this Jubril's issue is really idiotic,isnt it idiotic that you know a Sudanese is governing you and are only talking about it? Did Buhari's government make the global oil price fall from over $140 to less than $40? Bringing in GEJ's admin is lame
580 2018-12-12 22:51:53 おはようございますー
頑張りましょう~(｀∀´)
581 2018-12-12 22:51:37 @PnPCBC   Tell this Alberta guy that 44% of Quebec oil already comes from Alberta.  A further 20% is from the USA.
582 2018-12-12 22:51:37 True, but there'll be greater interest in using a technology if its resource requirements are easily met. The internal combustion engine came after widespread oil.
583 2018-12-12 22:51:36 Someone asked me how I get my hair slicked back so well for my ponytail  girl. It’s this product I like to call “my natural scalp oil.” Plz stop pointing it out 
584 2018-12-12 22:51:23 The sun will evaporate the oil, & the will donate $5 to.
585 2018-12-12 22:51:23 Here’s a sneak peek at our make intake going on tomorrow! $20 to make five stocking stuffer items using pure essential oil‘s.
586 2018-12-12 22:51:21 i can’t stand either !! whenever i get fries somewhere i sit there for like 10 minutes squishing the oil out with a napkin  i can’t bring myself to eat it otherwise skdkd or with any oily/greasy foods
587 2018-12-12 22:51:20 That sounds extreeeeemely dubious. To the best of my knowledge, unless your car is a fancy import or is old and fragile, you don’t need any special kind of oil...? Can you google the name of the fancy oil and see what you get?
588 2018-12-12 22:51:19 I know that I wouldn’t invest in the oil sector. I’m not surprised that the smart money is fleeing from the downward trends and looking to avoid stranded useless assets. Not to mention the liability that is the clean-up. #divest all the cool kids are ditching oil.
589 2018-12-12 22:51:18 FRANKIE MUNIZ IS SELLING MY MOM OLIVE OIL IN SCOTTSDALE
590 2018-12-12 22:51:02 One product that comes out of Quebec that is heavily used in the oil patch is the Prevost buses.
591 2018-12-12 22:50:50 my hair is soooo soft thanks to shea moisture leave in conditioner and castor oil
592 2018-12-12 22:50:41 You can get more time for having edibles or thc oil than having actual grams on you lol
593 2018-12-12 22:50:40 Coconut oil works wonders.
594 2018-12-12 22:50:38 Yep. But tankers full of Saudi oil is just fine. It’s time for Alberta to go its own way.
595 2018-12-12 22:50:35 Jim said he put olive oil in Aidan’s hair, it’s ALMOND OIL!!!!
596 2018-12-12 22:50:33 Rub some coconut oil on him and then put him in rice. 
597 2018-12-12 22:49:48 ”… the grace of joy is contagious. Holy joy will oil the wheels of your life’s machinery. Holy joy will strengthen you for your daily labor. Holy joy will beautify you and give you an influence over the lives of others.” -- Charles Spurgeon
598 2018-12-12 22:49:43 What we should do is put tariffs on all imported oil which would make the price of fuel very expensive for Quebec. Maybe than Quebec will change their tune
599 2018-12-12 22:49:43 niggas think they slick but i’m baby oil bitch 
600 2018-12-12 22:49:33 Oil and gas industry called him  back $$$
601 2018-12-12 22:49:31 Time to change brake oil
602 2018-12-12 22:49:31 Don't tell Trump about these lands, he'll be sending his coal & oil companies to explore & ruin it for the wildlife.
603 2018-12-12 22:49:26 Isn’t Google sponsoring the NZ media awards a bit like an oil company sponsoring an environmental gong? #VoyagerMediaAwards
604 2018-12-12 22:49:24 Yeah I got a Hobby Lobby ad I can soak that oil up with

610 2018-12-12 22:49:06 Yet they think it's okay to dump raw sewage and that it's ok to transport Saudi oil by pipeline.  Pipelines are the safest way to transport our oil.
611 2018-12-12 22:49:04 ??? Was against pipelines and Oil and now all for oil as it’s the only way out of financial mess Was played by Trudeau and her stint as Premier is coming to an end so desperate Hail Marys Rail refineries you name it

622 2018-12-12 22:48:21 Oil producers are not exempt. In fact Trudeau added upstream and downstream to the Energy East pipeline to hasten it's demise.
623 2018-12-12 22:47:54 Money talked. They were paid off. By an oil tycoon. Thank God that beast isn't in charge.

628 2018-12-12 22:47:22 Getting oil change & they're telling me I gotta get most expensive "tears from a unicorn" synthetic oil for $89, that Chevy "recommends" it & changed their recs last summer. He says it's on GM's website (I can't find). Am I being ripped off? An oil change is supposed to be $30.
629 2018-12-12 22:47:21 Lmao when I eat spicy food or I’m constipated. And some times when I eat a lot of oil or butter, I poop out orange oil

633 2018-12-12 22:46:36 Oil is in everything, from cars, clothes, to shampoo, face it, it’s not going away and WE ALL USE IT EVERYDAY!! Move off the oil rant.
634 2018-12-12 22:46:26 I know you can't get high from CBD oil, but I always feel a lil high after I take my 10 drops. Lol #placebo
635 2018-12-12 22:46:16 That is cult-level brainwashing. How about: "clever and kind people build giant multinational corporations bigger than governments that will coordinate towards ideological ends? Can't wait to tell my leftie friends that big oil is big and compelling because it is clever and kind.
636 2018-12-12 22:46:15 Greenpeace uses OIL.

Primary: clarification of oil, fat, grease through filtration and settling
Secondary: aerobic bacteria cleans up microbes
Final: cleaning (adding of chlorine, UV lights, and aeration)

652 2018-12-12 22:44:30 That being said, I use lysine+ it’s like $10 at any drug store. It works great. Also try putting tea tree oil directly on the sore. 
I have been prescribed valtrex, which shortens the symptoms, but depending on your insurance can be very expensive.

660 2018-12-12 22:43:57 Running for Senate in Texas means taking money for people who WORK for the oil and gas business. Does that mean Beto is #BigOil? Doubtful. Beto's problem is he really didn't connect to the WWC voters who #SherrodBrown gets love from.....

662 2018-12-12 22:43:44 He made the terrible nuclear deal with them letting them sell the oil and make money. He let them spend this money on terrorism. The Dems want radical Islamic to be spread all around the world. That's why Obama was a good ally for EU! but not Trump.

667 2018-12-12 22:42:43 It takes 45 to 60 days for cheaper oil prices to flow through. When it does they could each add 2-4 percent to the bottom line.

708 2018-12-12 22:37:51 Girl I asked every damn week after 36 she took me at 39 I was exhausted. Go to Tom bass and walk. I ain’t fuck with that castor oil cause they say it slow your baby heart beat down and I was too scared
709 2018-12-12 22:37:44 How do you think the Oil/Fuel hedging strategies panned out for the Trannies these past 2 months? 

Not too good is my guess... It will come out in the wash (earnings). Why these stocks are dead money until after this upcoming earnings cycle.
710 2018-12-12 22:37:34 I'm not making a value judgement either way. I'm simply pointing out where the market is headed. Capitalism, you know? I don't see any government altering the situation either to extend the reign of oil or hasten its demise, which means the market decides.
711 2018-12-12 22:37:29 FarmBill passed !! Bodes well for the biggest #Hemp play listed in Canada. 1600 acres already harvested for 2019 oil extraction $CANN.c $HERTF #potstocks #hempstocks #hemp #farmbill #marijuana #cannabis

713 2018-12-12 22:37:22 i'm was an electronic engineer by trade (Navy trained).  I like my politics rational and based on facts.  MMCC has been crammed down our throats (going against everything i learned in history) for years.
Time for public debate, bringing facts not feelz, big oil vs GW advocates.
714 2018-12-12 22:37:21 Dear Santa,

I’d like a weighted blanket, a new essential oil diffuser, a crate of 5.56, 9mm, and 7.62 ammo. 

Oh and —

One of those cheddar and sausage gift boxes they sell in the malls would be great too...

Good look, 

— Greg

716 2018-12-12 22:36:56 Yes, folks, one source of international corruption is the fossil fuels industry...big $$. Weapons industry is doing very nicely, too. So, think,  oil & weapons: Who doesn’t believe in climate change? And who wants to continue wars & fighting here & abroad? All abt billions of $$.

719 2018-12-12 22:36:51 You do know the UK doesn't sell it's oil or gas, right?
That isn't how the UK generates revenue from oil or gas.

Now, tell us, what has the international price per barrel got to do with revenues?

I'll wait.
720 2018-12-12 22:36:49 Makes sense, I'm literally swinging there next after my oil change lol
721 2018-12-12 22:36:43 Reply from the Planet, CDN oil is a much better alternative than oil from countries like Saudi Arabia. The planet needs more CDN oil, not less.
722 2018-12-12 22:36:36 Arancini balls. Stuffed with a small cube of melty cheese. Rolled in polenta for a crunchy crumb when fried in olive oil. Becomes a different beast altogether.
723 2018-12-12 22:36:30 Shute! I WISH I had straight hair!!  Meanwhile, the best products for my curly hair has always been those used by PoC. Cholesterol, Hair Mayonnaise, Oil Treatments, Cowash..I can't throw shade at anyone. I'm not mixed, but I get it. I went to school with MANY PoC and saw it all
724 2018-12-12 22:36:26 Oh I could charge to watch! Oil or mud?

726 2018-12-12 22:36:20 Been to two neurologists, my Ortho, my endocrinologist, my pulmonologist, and regular doctor. Nobody can figure out what my leg weakness is caused by (some days I can't move either, sometimes just one, very clumsy, CBD oil helps a lot but not 100%). No pain in my legs, just numb

729 2018-12-12 22:36:12 An undeliverable and misleading one, similar to the one about Turkey joining the EU and 4m+ Turks coming to the UK.

More utter bullshit. But, only a suggestion so no bother. Snake oil for sale!
730 2018-12-12 22:36:03 Norway  will ban palm oil! Yay! If there is #PalmOil oil in it I don’t buy it. #rainforests are more useful

734 2018-12-12 22:35:44 Commodity markets contradicted the general market sentiment. Base metals were mixed, and oil fell on lower reported usage in the US. Risk averse trading saw gold lift back above US $1,250. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
735 2018-12-12 22:35:24 Yes I have it my friend, we will get you a free bottle of beard oil sent out!
736 2018-12-12 22:35:24 I love the smell of sage.  Poison oak smells pretty good, too.  LOL.  Thanks.
737 2018-12-12 22:35:20 Now let's see the chart that shows big pharma, oil, auto, defense contractors,nra, healthcare, etc... After all, progressive=technology, conservative= well... regression. Not that I believe your "fake news" chart anyway, lol.
738 2018-12-12 22:35:10 Have you seen the documentary How Killed the Electric Car?
There are still rumblings of Hydrogen in the background, and it would appear that its predominantly oil companies wanting to use their infrastructure to maintain profits
739 2018-12-12 22:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this December? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

741 2018-12-12 22:34:31 They bought a $4.5 billion pipeline for the Alberta oil industry.
742 2018-12-12 22:34:27 I actually blame both. Quebec's attitude must change. They can't have it both ways and flaunt it i.e. We want more money and btw we think oil is disgusting.  If every province doesn't put the country first then confedertion will fail and its up to Trudeau to lead with this mantra
743 2018-12-12 22:34:25 #Notley wants to build an #oil refinery in #Alberta .  I support that!

Can we build a WATER REFINERY on the Indigenous reserves at the same time?

745 2018-12-12 22:33:51 & again the reason Americans are so obsessed about/ with Oil as well/ in general is because of all the insane Driving & Resources that they waste from the Earth/ in their Cities. (Just like Food, Light, Natural Gas, etc). It's such a wasteful Country & like a Crime to humanity.

He also calls the oil diffuser the “confuser.” 
754 2018-12-12 22:32:32 foods with oil and grease are the scariest, every time i eat something with oil or grease i think about how i already gained like 10 lbs out of that and it's just ajdkdkdkdkdkdkk

There are proper RnB albums out that you can listen to. You’ll need to rinse your ear with anointing oil after tho

781 2018-12-12 22:28:49 High reserves are not as a result of new ideas but oil prices rising above our budget benchmark. NPOWER, TraderMoni and all other monies are not new ideas. They are repeat of old socialist handouts that deepen or entrench poverty cause they do not address the real issues.

The previous managers of economy depleted our reserves, borrowed to pay salary, couldn't complete any previous project of past govt in 5yrs.
Buhari is growing the reserve, non oil sector is growing, Infrastructure is.
786 2018-12-12 22:28:16 No. Oil destroyed UK industry. It pushed the Pound up too high. It has done since 1979.

I would have thought John Kerry would have gotten alittle publicity here, but i get the feeling he will be running in 2020 for president. Media won't tie the democrat presidential candidate to India's oil and gas oligarchy.

795 2018-12-12 22:27:06 The US and oil cartel are after Venuzuela's heavy crude. They have been trying to bring the government down by all means possible, including assasination. It's all about the oil people.

Newfoundland is sitting on around 30 billion barrels of shale oil and this government has done nothing to develop the resources. Sound familiar? Justin Trudeau.

Canada.

838 2018-12-12 22:22:48 Tonight’s menu: seasoned 6oz sirloins dresses with sautéed garlic mushrooms. Then, lightly coated with garlic Alfredo and a sprinkle of flaked Asiago cheese. A la carte: 4 cheese baked macaroni and cheese and sliced squash with lemon zest, seasoning, and Greece-import olive oil
839 2018-12-12 22:22:41 Idk about all that. I just know they have a sign that says CBD and they have oil.
840 2018-12-12 22:22:38 This is confusing.  I thought Inhofe was owned by the oil industry.  Is there such a thing as a two pimp ho?  
@realDonaldTrump knows a lot about pimping and hoin' but we're not on speaking terms so I can't ask him.
841 2018-12-12 22:22:26 That’d be 60 political advisors on the public purse fluffing their lace hankerchiefs and staring deeply into the oil from an old holden working out what one nation would think of this? Stuffed it. #aaBill

856 2018-12-12 22:20:35 Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is based on its oil reserves. Are there other sources I’m not aware of? And how is Sweden’s state based on colonialism? I’ve heard this said but never explained.
857 2018-12-12 22:20:35 That’s what I thought. But my unc worked in oil fields never once worked a 48 hour shift lmao 18 and 24 but not two days in a row 
858 2018-12-12 22:20:10 The most expensive gas in town right now is $2.29 per gallon/regular. The reason it is so high is because it is one of the two full serve stations left in the city. Cheapest pump your own in the cold is hovering around $1.90-$2.15. Cali pumps its own oil. Why high price of gas?
859 2018-12-12 22:19:54 Whenever vape pens for oil first came out they were straight garbage and now they just kill your dumbass dead

862 2018-12-12 22:19:39 If you are suggesting the previous administration was helpful and encouraging to finders & producers of crude oil it isn’t the American administration. 

Iran, Venezuela, & Russia are EXTREMELY dependent on crude oil for income. Lower prices America has imposed are killing them.
863 2018-12-12 22:19:34 Lmfao oil can take anything off

865 2018-12-12 22:19:11 Nelson Martinez, former Venezuelan oil minister and Citgo CEO, died this afternoon from kidney complications at a military hospital in Caracas. Second former oil minister from the Opec country to die this year.
866 2018-12-12 22:19:06 This morning, I managed to dump just-brewed/poured coffee, starting at the bridge of my nose, alllll the way down my face & chest. Out of a non-spill/leak travel mug

Just now, super hot oil from my cast iron pan splattered DIRECTLY ONTO MY EYEBALL

So that’s how my day is going
867 2018-12-12 22:19:01 @KWCH12 I remember in the early 70s daylight savings time was temporary very dark until almost 9 am during Arab oil embargo.m. people then we're worried about school children in the dark however I'm all for it

871 2018-12-12 22:18:52 I’m now one of *those* people that does downward-facing dog

on the plus side, I did get free lavender oil 
872 2018-12-12 22:18:37 So basically, this shows 1) cities and 2) places with no people but lots of productive land (ag or mining).

Which, I guess, is useful as an accounting exercise, but "have oil but no people" isn't particularly helpful economic development advice
873 2018-12-12 22:18:36 I would like to ask you anne, what is it exactly that makes you think oil is dirty?
874 2018-12-12 22:18:32 Of course it is.
Everyone knows that oil rich countries have to be subsidised by their oil poor neighbours.
Just look at Norway, for example, and all the subsidies it gets from Sweden.
875 2018-12-12 22:18:10 Georgia ROL still pretty ropy. Saakashvili  is wanted in Georgia 4 corruption. Baltic is place u mean with real ROL in post Sov. 

Rus & Kaz not just oil. That’s so 90s. They have whole sectors full of successful modern co & some world class. You know full well it’s more complex
876 2018-12-12 22:18:06 They couldn't get them out.. They asked me to keep using some type of oil to soften the ear (Olive Oil or Cerumol) but then the pains is are unbearable.. Even with pain killers...

882 2018-12-12 22:17:24 I agree.could you imagine if there were 10s  of 1000s of jobs that payed 100 -150 thousand a year loading boats of Canadian oil for Europe.... but nope Trudeau would rather keep his foot on the country’s throat and keep stuffing the hogs in Quebec so he can get re-elected. Shame
883 2018-12-12 22:17:05 I’m far from an expert on oil trading, but aren’t these prices not really historically low or anything?  Wonder if that company that went under just had a dumb business model that was reliant on oil prices being unsustainably high. Just an uneducated guess on my part
884 2018-12-12 22:17:01 Made myself a new personal oil blend infused with herbs, essential oils and crystals. It’s perfect. I truly love creating for myself.

889 2018-12-12 22:16:12 Because you poured oil on a stove fire.  That's why.
890 2018-12-12 22:15:57 Sorry, I am discussing Mr. Wilson being a climate denier and an investor in the oil sector. I don't see the relevance.

Returned it 2 weeks ago and still waiting for confirmation of a refund/exchange & all their customer service can say is “it will be in a pile with all the others”
894 2018-12-12 22:15:24 Wouldn’t have anything to do with oil?

898 2018-12-12 22:15:05 I think you're right. DT's supporters would follow him off a cliff...but I have no idea why. It's clear he cares for himself first, and he's done so little for his supporters. I get he's charismatic, but he's a snake oil salesman, a charlatan. It flips me out! I don't get it.

905 2018-12-12 22:14:32 You won’t solve any of your issues if you are a separate country and B.C. still refuses to export additional oil
906 2018-12-12 22:14:26 Oh no! I’ve spent $10,000 on olive oil this year, damn.
907 2018-12-12 22:14:22 Agreed oil companies only look at profit they pay taxes on their revenue. It's up to govt to use the tax fund generated to improve economic growth and infrastructure for the people. If you vote corrupt people like OBJ, Atiku and PDP they are in it to loot

909 2018-12-12 22:14:01 Please what kind of oil? Perhaps the oil is mixed with pepper, thats why
910 2018-12-12 22:13:43 I work in Oil and gas and donated to Bernie and Justice democrats, that doesn't mean they support oil and gas, that's beyond stupid to say

912 2018-12-12 22:13:19 The United States can blame themsleves for it. By trying to force regime change and control Venezuela's oil what tecourse did they have? This is the same business as usual foreign policy that keeps dragging america into the mud and putting people's lives at risk.
913 2018-12-12 22:13:13 From next week snap will be full of people in Africa living their best life over the Christmas period, all i ask for is raw shea butter and raw coconut oil so i can male more beauty bits
914 2018-12-12 22:13:08 We could always out produce Saudi Arabia. Their oil is just more cheaply accessible than our oil.

And the economic turnaround is thanks to the previous administration.

918 2018-12-12 22:12:45 Doesn’t the oil industry get a subsidy of like 4.5 billion a year? The people who just landed a rover on Mars are telling us what we should be doing, but some people just don’t want to hear it I guess.
919 2018-12-12 22:12:41 You are right, debt and deficit are Canada wide, But debts should't be a burden on working people, rather one that should be solved by taking more from big corporations (ie oil n gas, GM) who don't pay their fair share.

926 2018-12-12 22:11:24 Because 50+% of the Texas workforce is labor. Construction, oil, agriculture, etc. We're constantly hauling equipment, dirt, supplies and all manner of things. And then there's white city boys who wear ten-gallon hats and have small penises.

931 2018-12-12 22:10:41 I don’t wanna argue, but if you have access to a grocery store, it’s actually insanely cheap and easy to eat foods without palm oil.. it’s the processed stuff that usually has palm oil that expensive. I’m saying this as a broke vegan.
932 2018-12-12 22:10:36 It's Frynight Tonight! And there's no oil in Sight, just Frylight to cook with, and it's a Delight. A Complete Range for Christmas , what can I Say, if I was to win, you would Make my Christmas Day! Frylight! Frylight! Sleep tight! Goodnight!

944 2018-12-12 22:08:57 Quebec is right on that. It is dirty oil. It’s time to divest from oil sand.

949 2018-12-12 22:08:06 If the Oil price is now too low for Drillers to profit, we can expect more bad news from the energy sector and that's just another chink in the armor of the SPX....
950 2018-12-12 22:08:01 Cook chopped bitter gourd in 2 tbsp oil on medium-low heat covered for 10 minutes. Then add Indian spices such as turmeric powder (1/4 tsp), cumin-coriander powder (2tsp), salt to taste, red chilli powder to taste and sugar to taste. Serve with roti/chapati/any flat bread.

955 2018-12-12 22:07:23 Hey @chrishelman , When API and EIA issue widely divergent estimates of oil draw-downs, who is more credible? Is it possible that divergence is political influence by President on EIA info?

965 2018-12-12 22:05:53 Sure it adds up & you know it does. It's an open secret. Follow the Arabian &  oil thru the supply chain from field to refinery.

970 2018-12-12 22:05:43 JOHN! I didnt know you can oil paint
971 2018-12-12 22:05:31 I believe it was. In the latter half of the 20th century it was big pharmaceuticals, before them it was oil, before them it was tobacco, before them, oil again, gold. It's always been there mate, it's just way more blatant now.
972 2018-12-12 22:05:29 You know what dramatically reduces carbon emissions? Keeping the oil in the fucking ground in the first place.
973 2018-12-12 22:05:24 ぜひぜひ
974 2018-12-12 22:04:57 Please dont forget to put lotion and oil on yall it's cold in these streets.
975 2018-12-12 22:04:52 Fact is if you use any oil or gass products or anthing made using them your still poluting. It doesn't matter if its Albert produced or imported.  i prefer to support Canadian, put my energies into making it safer for all of us.  Like you I did not create the system.
976 2018-12-12 22:04:48 Oil and gas isn't going anywhere and by delaying a pipeline you're causing more pollution by forcing rail and trucking use rather than the most efficient option.  One shipment of crude by rail instead of pipe will wipe out any veggies you grew for your families lifetime by 1000x
977 2018-12-12 22:04:25 The way people malign Tinubu on twitter, you would think he was a tout in Oshodi who made it in life with politics and not someone who rose to the top of his career in a Major oil company. 
He hasn't been perfect, but don't overlook the role he has played in Nigeria's politics.
978 2018-12-12 22:04:17 Daniel is a snake oil merchant.
979 2018-12-12 22:04:15 Man someone get me into the oil field
980 2018-12-12 22:04:14 yah it's not even "oil and gas money" it's money from people who are employees of the oil&gas industry and happen to be liberals who donate to the Democratic party lol

983 2018-12-12 22:04:06 China keeps building empty abandoned cities to continue growth. Saudi is running out of oil. Soon we wont even NEED oil (look out, Russia). Japan has no resources. 

Things are going to get very interesting very soon.

985 2018-12-12 22:03:49 Austerity on its own has never resolved a debt crisis, not once, in any type of government, anywhere

Taxes and increasing GDP developing new businesses does 

Oil might work, but can you build infrastructure and compete in a price war with OPEC without new tax revenue??
986 2018-12-12 22:03:26 we can find "individuals in oil & gas" who gave to Bernie's campaign. What matters is if the candidate will be doing the bidding of the oil & gas bosses.
987 2018-12-12 22:03:19 My lil bih so spoiled. I rub her down in oil.
988 2018-12-12 22:03:12 *We talk John Rockefeller in History*

989 2018-12-12 22:03:07 OUR HOPE IS THIS DONALD J. TRUMP WILL SEE THE LIGHT AND REINSTATE NEW FREE HANDGUNS AND AMMO FOR ALL USA CITIZENS! AND NO MORE OIL IN THIS COUNTRY NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL REPLACE OUR AGING INFRASTRUCTURE FROM 75+ YEARS AGO MKAY!
990 2018-12-12 22:02:59 Agree.
991 2018-12-12 22:02:46 Had our shopping stolen today..can everyone please look out for a man in a green knitted elf suit with hood (from Oxfam Bold Street) wearing a Putin or Melania mask and smelling of patchouli oil. Thanks. #sentimentalvalue #Liverpool @angelcakepics

993 2018-12-12 22:02:35 Stop buying OPEC oil for your campaign trips. That's a start.
994 2018-12-12 22:02:30 Up in Spirit River today for Tourmaline Oil for their annual safety meeting. 
Safety works so work safe!
995 2018-12-12 22:02:23 In truth Blake is right.  Most of his money is in stock, if he cashed it, he'd crash the market.  The real billionaires whose money is in material are the middle eastern oil royalty.  They can drop billions in cash
996 2018-12-12 22:02:17 The two leading causes of deforestation, particularly the Amazon, is animal agriculture and palm oil production. Some Scientists have made calculations that even if you took out all forms of electricity produced mainly through coal/fossil fuels we would still see climate change
997 2018-12-12 22:02:12 Iran? You mean the country with c10% of the world’s oil reserves? 
998 2018-12-12 22:02:10 Under Obama and Clinton they would get the minerals.  Uranium gold silver oil and more. In Nevada Federal took over 80% of Nevada. In Oregon Federal took over 50% of the land.

1005 2018-12-12 22:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or Libya.
1006 2018-12-12 22:01:07 Sitting at the dealership getting my car serviced. 6 total customers.

One was even complaining enough she wanted her oil change comped. Funny how that happens.
1007 2018-12-12 22:01:04 Holy smokes, I even manage 22mpg in the 540i! I also have oil leaks, mind.
1008 2018-12-12 22:00:50 AB needs access to water. The US has recently found alot of oil via fracking and are moving their own product. The incremental business is off shore.
Importing labour is more hassle than from other prov's, passports paper work etc. However, AB can overcome this w/ good policy.
1009 2018-12-12 22:00:47 If you are in the pocket of oil, you are pretty much assured a position to combat emissions.
1010 2018-12-12 22:00:46 Stir together 1 pound carrots with 3 cups honey. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve to your worst enemy.
1011 2018-12-12 22:00:43 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this December? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1018 2018-12-12 22:00:09 "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords." ~Psalms 55:21 #Jesus #God #Bible

1020 2018-12-12 21:59:58 I highly doubt they would become land locked. Most likely join the USA and instantly get full market value for the oil. If Alberta joined the USA , they would have instant access to the largest economy in the world free of any trade barriers.
1021 2018-12-12 21:59:57 Wastewater is produced at all oil wells, not just hydraulic fracturing sites.
1022 2018-12-12 21:59:46 I use this Brazil nut oil on my hair and I love it but I stole it from my mom and I don’t even know we’re she got it from 
1023 2018-12-12 21:59:18 They remind me a lot of like an oil rig or coal plant combined into a monster so the fire ability is really appropriate
1024 2018-12-12 21:59:18 Which essential oil will make me study
1025 2018-12-12 21:59:16 Somebody please take lil Larry for oil change please 
1026 2018-12-12 21:59:01 今日待ち合わせしてるからかなぁ、車で送ってもらう予定だったんだけど運転手さんの都合でくっそ遅刻する夢見た…こわい……
1027 2018-12-12 21:58:54 My entire goal for Christmas last year was to get something for my Godfather that he would actually enjoy. And I ROCKED it. For real. He still uses his olive oil infuser all the time.

But it creates a new problem - how do I follow that up? There's so much pressure now!
1028 2018-12-12 21:58:48 I feel like such an adult when I get my oil changed. Even though this time it was WAAYYY overdue. #dontjudgeme #stillgettinitdone
1029 2018-12-12 21:58:40 You tripping that’s how you soak up the oil
1030 2018-12-12 21:58:22 Biotin vitamins!! Coconut oil in your hair over night once a week, no heat (straightening,curling,etc), silk pillow cases, keeping your hair down as much as possible (no buns, tight ponytails), shampoo less and only shampoo the roots, massaging your scalp to increase blood flow
1031 2018-12-12 21:58:11 NO OIL DRILLING IN ALASKAN WATERS OR OUR LAND!! LEAVE OUR LAND & WATER ALONE!!!
1032 2018-12-12 21:57:42 Yo these guys at the oil change place are trying SO FUCKING HARD to sell me a $40 filter for my car... I DONT WANT IT 
1033 2018-12-12 21:57:28 Burning the midnight oil? That’s for amateurs. Later, I’ll be baking the midnight cake
1034 2018-12-12 21:57:13 Your first red flag to your thinking should be why would they make a rule like that?  With little time you would know. When they tell you to change your oil in your car , do you say to yourself if I didn’t have to change the oil I would save money, I will just not change it?
1035 2018-12-12 21:57:10 What my Senator Cardin fails to comprehend is President Trump cares enough to make America #1 in oil production, bigger than Saudi’s.

 Am #1 in % of adult population working. Highest employment of every minority, even kids w/o high school diploma’s find work.

You don’t care.
1036 2018-12-12 21:57:04 I like to use Shea Moisture’s Jamaican castor oil hair mask on wash days and it’s helped me lose less hair
1037 2018-12-12 21:57:02 I would never rule out optical illusion but I suspect oil/gas.
1038 2018-12-12 21:56:42 おぱよぉおお！！！！
1039 2018-12-12 21:56:32 @TheBreakdown167   I’m a parent and I do not want any olive oil for Christmas
1040 2018-12-12 21:56:31 I was just about to say... nothing related at all is trending!! 
Oil money runs so deep #YemenVote

1044 2018-12-12 21:55:58 Just use oil sheen It loosen it up

Great News for Americans!
#CheapOilAndGas
1046 2018-12-12 21:55:41 What's your take on the apparent productivity of much of the rural center and west, as opposed to the rural southeast? More capital intensive industries (oil, gas, grain agriculture)? Noise? Optical illusion?
1047 2018-12-12 21:55:38 I believe this is a second assault on our water. The first one want bad enough, allowing coal sludge to be dumped in streams. They had to go further.

Can't wait to see their faces when they realize they can't drink oil.
1048 2018-12-12 21:55:37 Nothing like the biggest crisis since WWII. You should have tried the 1970s. Oil. Ulster. Strikes. Power cuts. Inflation. National Front. Shortened working week. Election drama. Minority govt. IMF. Lib-Lab pact. Winter of Discontent. Current hysteria doesn’t compare.
1049 2018-12-12 21:55:26 Flint smells like weed and motor oil
1050 2018-12-12 21:55:25 Oil production should be controlled and have less produce.
1051 2018-12-12 21:55:19 Restricting “NO GROWTH INDUSTRY”
Buy rail cars, weld them together, Place in ditch line & cover, it’s called a pipe line IDIOT
Leave it in the ground, Embarrassing cousin, NYSE “there no future in Alberta oil”
It’s called energy east a pipe line, All of  works then
1052 2018-12-12 21:55:11 I feel it brother you gotta take the L to learn more sometimes. That’s why I’m not in the oil fields making them big bucks
1053 2018-12-12 21:55:02 Alaskans own 208,000 shares of SHANGHAI DASHENG AGRICULTURAL, worth $20,341. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CHINA.
1054 2018-12-12 21:54:56 lets use it for domestic use instead of importing oil from other countries, like we do now ..  brings us national security, keeps the money in #Canada while we pivot to clean energy sources #cdnpoli we have lots pipelines already in use... Don't want to see more bitumen #BCwaters
1055 2018-12-12 21:54:52 What would the Oil have to give up to get Colton parayko? Or Edmundson?
1056 2018-12-12 21:54:43 Which essential oil do I use to get rid of my debt?
1057 2018-12-12 21:54:42 You need rehabilitation..  palm oil rehab 
1058 2018-12-12 21:54:42 Isn’t gas like the most inelastic thing in the economy? Low gas prices mean more productive consumption and lower profits for oil corps, with less than a 1:1 trade for increased traffic and emissions. But maybe your research shows otherwise?
1059 2018-12-12 21:54:39 Oil Kirby: Like water but with crude oil instead.

Pollute the countryside. Poison the seas. Make a profit.
1060 2018-12-12 21:54:35 Alberta would like to discuss why we need to pay Quebec for their expensive cheese and milk, but they refuse to buy our discount oil?
1061 2018-12-12 21:54:35  All you need to do is put oil sheen on it & it’ll loosen up
1062 2018-12-12 21:54:19 Update score please. 
1063 2018-12-12 21:54:12 Global warming stopped by placing restriction on Coal, Oil, plastic manufacturers. We need to go back to paper and glass which is recyclable. Throwing money on a problem does not solve the problem. Our legalistives bodies in Washington DC and each State in the Union need to take
1064 2018-12-12 21:54:04 i do the classic olive oil, salt and pepper roast in the oven but need more ideas!
1065 2018-12-12 21:53:41 Do you want to compare investors in Lagos with Shell,Chevron,ExxonMobil and hundreds of independent oil companies based in oil producing states for decades? Yet the states have nothing to show for development.#Shame
1066 2018-12-12 21:53:38 Hes taking on big oil and the media not an easy task for one man. Big oil owns 90 percent of the worlds money and he's simply saying we can live without it. Guys a fkn hero.
1067 2018-12-12 21:53:35 
1068 2018-12-12 21:53:34 i’d pick blow over oil any day
1069 2018-12-12 21:53:30 Oh no, lavender is only good to piss off moths. I think cherry, coconut, almond oil, cocoa butter, orange blossom, mint, ginger are the best. No particular order.
1070 2018-12-12 21:53:07 If it were my choice  I would ban US coal from Vancouver Ports tomorrow & replace it with Alberta oil shipments via the TM pipeline.
 I would do this even as we pursue Green tech, hydro etc. as we span a continent & serve a globe, one size does not fit all.
1071 2018-12-12 21:53:05 I wish castor oil and Shea butter didn’t smell the way they do
1072 2018-12-12 21:52:40 Should I try oil paints or stick to acrylics, is my question
1073 2018-12-12 21:52:38 To me this is very simple, whether it’s oil, cars, dairy, lumber, seafood or agriculture CDN’s should support and put a priority on buying CDN goods and services. Canada isn’t thinking like one country, we now act as 10 individual countries each only thinking of themselves.
1074 2018-12-12 21:52:16 Argan oil eco gel
1075 2018-12-12 21:51:49 And then to get to real, just look at oil
1076 2018-12-12 21:51:32 I require this. I require it now. With bread. And some extra virgin olive oil. And fresh basil.
1077 2018-12-12 21:51:28 Agreed!
This statement was believed to be made in 1988 at the “peak”of the Oil industry..
1078 2018-12-12 21:51:24 Didn’t know there’s a body oil spot on 79th. If it wasn’t for work, wouldn’t have known
1079 2018-12-12 21:51:15 The BSS charge what they want, because Black women will pay out the nose.  I could get rich if I owned a BSS, but I’m  Black woman.  Get it?  I use a drop or two of peppermint oil in 16 oz of distilled water on my hair.  Wash it with Dr Bronner soap.
1080 2018-12-12 21:51:11 Yeah long gone are the days where I wait on  any nigga to do something for me... that’s out.. oil change and hopefully an affordable inspection
1081 2018-12-12 21:51:10 "The ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and left out there.

It's natural. It's as natural as the ocean water is." --Rush Limbaugh, on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, May 3, 2010
1082 2018-12-12 21:51:00 None.Even the states with thousands of Oil blocks can't stand near Lagos.
1083 2018-12-12 21:50:58 ^^^^^^^
1084 2018-12-12 21:50:45 Opponents also enjoy making oil and gas more expensive. It is part of collapsing the industry. There is also an enjoyment of the possibility of accidents or sabotage. Causing energy poverty is the goal.
1085 2018-12-12 21:50:43 Coconut oil can be used as mouth wash
1086 2018-12-12 21:50:38 Calling around health stores in Columbia looking for cbd oil and these folks are acting like I’m hunting down weed.
1087 2018-12-12 21:50:31 Tell me, which nation like ours that has always depended on oil got out of recession and suddenly enters 3% growth? Oga economics is not magic o!  A lot of these things takes time
1088 2018-12-12 21:50:26 Nuh think oil can save dat ma’am. We would need some TICK oil fi dah stiffness deh.

1090 2018-12-12 21:50:21 @F3LakeEffect I am an F3 brother down in Raleigh, NC. I recently published a Christian children’s book that has historical ties to the 2010 oil spill! I would love to find a plug into that area to make the book known, and so was curious to know if you could help in any way?!?
1091 2018-12-12 21:50:03  I can do oil changes. I’m not in the area but, maybe, if you time it right, next time you link with  @IAMCLAAS he’ll hook you up. You’d know better than me. 
1092 2018-12-12 21:50:03 Yes working class people drill the holes for oil, not like the fossil fuel lobby has some sort of financial interest in keeping us from massively shifting our production towards renewable energy as a COLLECTIVE, capitalists can only think in terms of individual consumers.
1093 2018-12-12 21:49:56 There’s not enough peppermint oil in the world to calm my anxiety today 
1094 2018-12-12 21:49:55 Really peeing me off on #Corrie Absolute total propaganda re cancer & vaccinations!  Really think the UK is leading cancer revolution?  Ashya King ( ring ) Callie Blackwell cured terminal cancer with #cannabis oil & overseas treatment. These stories are not rare anymore.
1095 2018-12-12 21:49:51 Olie ... lees het boek "Oil for immigation" van Bat Ye'Or
1096 2018-12-12 21:49:44 Right after she gets paid by the oil lobby for drilling in the arctic wildlife refuge in #Alaska right @lisamurkowski ?
1097 2018-12-12 21:49:36 More prominent step will be banning use of unhealthy cooking oil and chemicals used in food mainly fast foods.... But targeting them is difficult as they are rich people
1098 2018-12-12 21:49:23 TX gets billions in subsidies. How much did you get when the recent hurricane hit? I say pull all oil subsidies. Pull all farming subsidies. And make states pay for their own recoveries from storms. The Northeast shouldn’t be paying to fix FL, SC, TX etc. We rarely get wiped out
1099 2018-12-12 21:49:17 I just called jarrett while i was getting an oil change and my phone was still connected through Bluetooth in my car and he was blaring through the shop 
1100 2018-12-12 21:49:09 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?

1103 2018-12-12 21:48:53 Also it's like 4th grade science that you learn oil and water DONT MIX
1104 2018-12-12 21:48:45 Sorry for the middle class rant but WHO PUTS LIMONCELLO IN AN OLIVE OIL BOTTLE? #salad #ruined
1105 2018-12-12 21:48:41 #WJCD1A:  Edmonton Oil Kings LW Vladimir Alistrov (Ranked No. 103) scored 2g & 1a, and Prince Albert C Alexei Protas (Ranked No. 274) had 2a as Belarus blanked Austria 5-0. Protas is tied with Ivan Dorzdov (2019/1999) for tourney scoring lead with 2-3-5.
1106 2018-12-12 21:48:25 Actualky a pizxa is pretty healthy eating without meat, cheese, refined flour...

Just slurp the olive oil from the top.
1107 2018-12-12 21:48:20 I think we should stop classifying olive oil on whether it’s a virgin or not, it’s a very outdated stereotype.
1108 2018-12-12 21:48:13 do you just enjoy proving my points?
1109 2018-12-12 21:48:11 Pay the UK 55/60billion and get back less than £30billion since when does defence which is non existent and EU fees cost £30billion on top of that we provide gas, electric and agriculture to England and they give back nothing to the UK at all. I didn't even include our oil.
1110 2018-12-12 21:48:09 Na. Maybe you should make Greek dressing beard oil.

1114 2018-12-12 21:47:16 So I just took my car to the Honda dealership, JUST for an oil change & tire rotation, and I’m leaving with a brand new car. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me. I need to start sending someone else to do my oil changes for me. Guess I’m a sucker! 
1115 2018-12-12 21:47:12 So who needs Saudi Arabia or oil from Venezuela?
1116 2018-12-12 21:47:11 Literally every day since I bought my car has been spent trying to make it a lil better and a lil bit more mine. today was oil change and wash. I love my narcmobile.
1117 2018-12-12 21:47:01 Just Converting cars to renewable electric vehicles would decrease climate change.While Trucks need diesel for carrying weight, any diesel engine can run on Hemp Oil.
1118 2018-12-12 21:46:48 It's eggs & oil whipped together...
1119 2018-12-12 21:46:38 My question is, why is the president so anxious to extend the martial law in mindanao despite the lack of actual uprising and resistance from the people? But i what i know is that the mountains in Mindanao are rich in expensive natural gas and oil deposits. Hello China!
1120 2018-12-12 21:46:25 sometimes people put slightly warmed olive oil in it and then wiggle your ear until it’s in and then put cotton wool in and sleep with it in? sometimes works
1121 2018-12-12 21:46:22 #mufc i love you unconditionally. Well that's 90 minutes of garbage. I'd rather have boiled my head in hot oil.
1122 2018-12-12 21:46:03 I absolutely hate the smell of tea tree oil but I want my face to clear up 
1123 2018-12-12 21:45:57 Not true in the least. Pipelines run underground, thus increasing the environmental affects in the event of an oil spill exponentially.
1124 2018-12-12 21:45:54 #IfTheGrinchWereCanadian, he'd keep pushing construction of pipelines all over the US and Canada to transport dirty tar sands oil.
1125 2018-12-12 21:45:52 Remember when Farage said he wanted us to be like Norway??? He’s a snake oil salesman now a NOBODY since he’s no longer a member of the UKIP. 

Why’s anyone giving this charlatan air time???
1126 2018-12-12 21:45:51 Why? You don't mind oil companies running your life!!
1127 2018-12-12 21:45:50 Omg I recommend cauliflower rice!!!! It’s the best like there’s so much you can do with it. I always make fried rice with avocado oil and I add egg, mushrooms, asparagus, green onions, tiny bit of carrots, chicken/beef/whatever I have on hand, soy sauce, sesame oil, & bacon bits
1128 2018-12-12 21:45:26 Reeking of patchouli oil
1129 2018-12-12 21:45:24 Don't forget the chair legs.  Everything must glow with the luster of furniture oil when Mom is coming.   If questioned, you must confirm that it ALWAYS looks like that.
1130 2018-12-12 21:45:22 What are you doing to save me? Using paper straws? Maybe use some of your carbon credits and take a trip to Asia and see how much greener and respectful to the environment Canada is. Please don't reply on your iPhone made of oil derivative products - send it on home made paper
1131 2018-12-12 21:45:05 In bed at half nine, smothered in olbas oil and Vicks. 

Why am I single again?
1132 2018-12-12 21:45:00 @Richzeoli  Listen on the radio that COM hey play you’re oil bit at least 30 times a day please don’t play… Thanks
1133 2018-12-12 21:44:59 Is it Japanese cherry blossom or the way you spelled it bcse now I'm curious. I really like that Baylis and Harding almond oil. But I used to get their little fancy soaps for my grans and I still have a few packs left over this year, but my grans have passed on and it bums me out

1135 2018-12-12 21:44:41 I’m diffusing peppermint oil in my room in the hopes that it’ll help me concentrate but all I’ve gotten so far is a headache
1136 2018-12-12 21:44:37 The bullshit anti-immigrant sentiment you're spouting benefits the very people who are responsible for homelessness in this country. The scapegoating of immigrants is a technique used to distract from the billionaires robbing us blind. Seems to have worked on you.
1137 2018-12-12 21:44:32 it was decided at state level which is the way it should've stayed if that was what the states wanted. I don't think it should've been talked about in state government either. I don't think they should do marriage licenses either
1138 2018-12-12 21:44:23 Daniel, the snake oil salesman! #TheApprentice
1139 2018-12-12 21:44:16 He will as things currently stand. How can Tories appear in any way united with her as PM? They will get slaughtered. Jeremy has no idea either! Still we've lived through the miners strike, 3 day week, oil crises and financial meltdowns. We'll get by.
1140 2018-12-12 21:44:15 Neem oil stinks. But it's working for my hair
1141 2018-12-12 21:44:09 Working on some essential oil mixes for an orphaned cat that we are helping
1142 2018-12-12 21:44:02 @NicolasMaduro is now emboldened having Russian Nuclear bombers en Venezuela and the worlds largest oil reserves are now firmly in the hands of Vladimir Putin,The Chinese,Turkey and Cuba. The world needs to wake up fast before the entire subcontinent falls same as the Middle East
1143 2018-12-12 21:44:02 No. . Saying all the issues arising from the 30k. To make it balanced; state allocation might be increased or should be. But is this achievable with present oil prices? Just normal issues not tackling u
1144 2018-12-12 21:43:50 Sir you have oil on your head..
1145 2018-12-12 21:43:50 My hands it oil not to touch my phone in the touchscreen. #Smartphone #Cellphone #touchscreen
1146 2018-12-12 21:43:43 My favorite dinosaur is oil
1147 2018-12-12 21:43:31 That pussy got too many miles time for oil change
1148 2018-12-12 21:43:30 Pretty bad...higher fuel taxes (a current proposal) could make oil theft more attractive, too.
1149 2018-12-12 21:43:13 Doesn’t Norway have greater oil production on a per capita basis than Saudi Arabia?
1150 2018-12-12 21:43:12 It's been proven that fracking doesn't cause earthquakes... sinkholes are caused by water depletion in underground caverns... quit listening to the Soros groups who write his dictated garbage.. his Brazilian and African oil companies are losing ground.
1151 2018-12-12 21:43:03 Meanwhile eastern Canada's is fueled by tankers from Venezuela or Saudi Arabia who have horrible human rights violations and very poor environmental regulations. 
And its shipped to eastern Canada where %50 of Maritimes still burn home heating oil
1152 2018-12-12 21:43:00 If you want to save a few extra calories when eating pizza, here are some quick tips:

1) Thin crust instead of thick crust
2) Use a napkin to dab the oil off
3) Cheese instead of pepperoni
1153 2018-12-12 21:42:59 People need to get off their high horse and stop expecting politicians to take responsibility for their career choices. Oil is dead, we should not spend any more on this industry.
1154 2018-12-12 21:42:56 1> Natural gas, coal and oil are examples of what type of fuel? #trivia
1155 2018-12-12 21:42:29 Tweeting this to remind my forgetful self

Buy cooking oil binch, the reason your haven't been cooking isn't because you're lazy but because you DON'T HAVE COOKING OIL
1156 2018-12-12 21:42:24 I don’t do anything fancy, just oil my chain more and wipe my bike down
1157 2018-12-12 21:42:23 Making boneless skinnless chicken thighs with a rosemary, garlic, and olive oil paste on them. Owen wants it with Mac 'n' Cheese.

1163 2018-12-12 21:42:06 Can't cut off that oil flow, no matter people die because of it.
1164 2018-12-12 21:42:03 After all it's oil money
1165 2018-12-12 21:42:02 I had asked a question about the oil, for a particular use, but never got a response.
1166 2018-12-12 21:41:57 Yeah me too
1167 2018-12-12 21:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1168 2018-12-12 21:41:43 I dumb down my skin routine to just oil cleanser, regular cleanser, toner, treatment/serum, moisturizer. All travel sizes. I take powder foundation so it doesn’t count towards my liquids.
1169 2018-12-12 21:41:27 Our favorite oil!
1170 2018-12-12 21:41:24 Somebody said but how do you take it off. Gurl said coconut oil and time 
1171 2018-12-12 21:40:57 #DadelandDodgeService, Since I could not address my concerns on their website, so I decided to try it here. SERVICE CUSTOMERS BEWARE!  On 12-1-18, I took my 2014 Ram 1500 for an oil change and a recall notice I received. I left the dealership 2 hrs. later with my truck, (cont.)

1174 2018-12-12 21:40:39 @LefflerEnergy is attempting to take advantage of my 75 y/o widowed mother. They filled a compromised tank with oil and then reported her to the DEP. Help me spread the word of their pitiful business practices. My mom is one tough lady and refuses to be a victim.
1175 2018-12-12 21:40:38 Team BG up bottling from 7am everyday for weeks. Voice is gone- in bed shattered. @farmerkaney out filtering oil for another couple of hours!

1194 2018-12-12 21:38:48 No one gave away 150 B$ to Iran. After the JCPOA, sanctions against Iran was removed; therefore Iran was able to reach its frozen money in foreign banks! Iran gained some of these via Oil & Gas traidings, some othere were Irans debt obligations to china and Europe....
1195 2018-12-12 21:38:48 Socially acceptable cars.  Acceptable oil tankers and middle eastern crude. Acceptable crude-by-rail.  Acceptable refineries.  Acceptable receipt of transfer payments.  Legault’s statement is beyond the pale.
1196 2018-12-12 21:38:47 Yes, @RachelNotley, your oil pays for a lot of very important things, but it IS dirty. What do we do when our earth is not hospitable for us humans anymore? You have a 4-year plan for that? #polqc #polcan

1198 2018-12-12 21:38:30 The only reason this is interesting, is this guy is a self built, rags to riches guy. Also talking about labour, which is the left wing. So it’s the opposite of what happened in the USA. Surprised you didn’t notice this with the Venezuela without the oil comment.
1199 2018-12-12 21:38:24 My sister started giving the drops to her standard poodle about a year ago and it's had a very palpable effect on his anxiety and temperament. He also had seizures before and they've drastically reduced since starting CBD oil. My experience is it's worth trying.

1203 2018-12-12 21:38:07 U put these little cardboard egg carton-esque things inside and then just pour fat/oil into them and then they soak it up and you toss it out and put in a new one once it’s saturated
1204 2018-12-12 21:37:52 Hardly a xenophobic little Britisher when prepared to help the a Saudi enterprise (remember those nice Saudi people...have similar views to 'hanging' Hayes) and a Middle East oil outfit....

1205 2018-12-12 21:37:48 I was unsure, but went for it.. Back in the real world, we'd have to develop our high tech sector and boost our home-grown skills base for I fear we cannot rely on oil for much longer.

1219 2018-12-12 21:36:03 Environmental activists have destroyed hundreds of thousands of livelihoods in western Canada in 2018, while the demand for oil has gone up.  In my world, if you take people's money you have to provide a product or service.  Pipeline activists need to be held accountable.
1220 2018-12-12 21:36:03 How is this still happening? If I leave my garbages out in front of my house 1 extra day I have a cease and desist order pasted on my front door. Is my HOA more effective than our regulations for the oil industry. Just have Elon Musk build every car. Problem solved.

1228 2018-12-12 21:34:41 Trump is such an idiot, has such a cartoon villain sense of reality. He calls releasing Iran’s own frozen assets “Giving” billions. Criticizes not “taking” Iraqi oil. As if the normal course of events is to pillage a country. While we’re at it, why didn’t we rape their women ?
1229 2018-12-12 21:34:41 Hi there. We are actively looking for alternatives to palm kernel oil, but in the meantime, the majority of our products do not contain palm kernel oil. If you’re looking for KIND products made without it, we’d be happy to point you in the right direction.
1230 2018-12-12 21:34:34 There are children literally being starved to death by the Saudis with US weaponry (and American taxpayers aren't even being reimbursed for refueling, for the oil that they've bought from the Saudis, so it's a fucking joke all round).
1231 2018-12-12 21:34:33 Coconut oil is great. I made deodorant with it too. Coconut oil, corn starch, baking soda and a little essential oil for scent. Mix well and store in a canister. You apply a pea sized amount like a cream to your armpits.

1240 2018-12-12 21:33:26 Like small rice, but softer. I've had it three different ways:

1. Microwaved in it's own steamable bag. It was its most firm. Not a fan.
2. Sauteed in a skillet w/ olive oil and seasoning. My staple.
3. Stir fried with some Asian sauces and scrambled eggs. Surprisingly good!
1241 2018-12-12 21:33:18 That's probably the case mate.... there's probably a plan to take us to the shitter and then they'll sell the country to an oil Barron in the middle east

1251 2018-12-12 21:32:23 Not to mention that doing this would effectively end the fake War on Terror. Once people no longer need oil in the same quantities the US loses interest in bombing those countries and those “terrorists” can no longer fund their insurgency and attacks. Win/win
1252 2018-12-12 21:32:19 One of my favorite things when I'm depressed is a bath with coconut oil Epsom salts, aveeno oatmeal bath, and aromatherapy stress relief foam bath from bath and body works. Makes me feel like a whole new person.
1253 2018-12-12 21:32:19 If you are giving real information or selling a legit product I am in full support. But these online gurus saying buying ads and selling anything will net you a prosperous life is snake oil salesman at it's finest.
1254 2018-12-12 21:32:12 There is no deep state in America.  U and others peddle that snake oil to detract from the incompetency, highway robbery, bigotry, and ignorance that is currently entangling the Republican party.  Go back to ordering more faux medals.
1255 2018-12-12 21:32:06 I don't get the replies in this thread or the idea of "bought media". Do you seriously think journos will change their writing based on tax credits? No one seems to mind tax dollars going to farmers or oil/gas?
1256 2018-12-12 21:32:04 Someone threw a bottle of omega 3 pills at me today.  Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil.
1257 2018-12-12 21:32:04 to do is dig an oilwell, retrieve said oil, refine it and sell it. Families all over Iran and Syria are doing that very thing.
If you want to start a bank, without the government, all it takes is money.
If you want to eat, grow it.
No one owes you a damn thing.
1258 2018-12-12 21:32:02 But has she told us where the secret oil fields are?
1259 2018-12-12 21:31:56 As Bernie Sanders suggested on Colbert the other night, oil companies spend big money on commercials which could be why news networks are deliberately avoiding the topic of climate change.

1263 2018-12-12 21:31:37 My mom keeps putting products in my baby hair when all he needs is some water and coconut oil, not that extra stuff  maybe almond oil but that’s it
1264 2018-12-12 21:31:36 Your publication is funded by oil barons. You clearly are on the side of "Climate change is not manmade, and if it is, it is not a big deal". What you're doing here is a disingenuous tactic called "concern trolling" where you pretend to care so that you can win arguments.
1265 2018-12-12 21:31:33 LOL I mean, I hella got that dealership discount and all but it’s like, oooh rotated my tires and changed my oil??? BET.  topped off all my fluids? Who gave you permission

1271 2018-12-12 21:30:50 @democracynow I fear the only way to impact global change is for average citizen (world's poor) to join, create our own solar/alternative companies and simply STOP USING OIL. It's possible; or, China will become world leader in solar/and other renewables and take over global mrkt

1277 2018-12-12 21:30:24 So? What's your point? That well never run out? Someone miscalculated the amount we'd be using? The fact is, oil/fossil fuels are limited, but more important,  if we don't get off that addiction to them, the climate change spurred by their use will make the amount moot.

no creation
not new products
not the environment and having a few having it all and the most having nothing then setting them to war against each other

And keeping them dependent upon oil

longer and longer

1287 2018-12-12 21:29:31 The United States is now number one exporter of oil...
It is being reported that for the first time in 75 years, the United States has exported more oil than it brought in, the Daily Wire reports.

Well testing 5000 bbl/d well by burning every thing in a sand pit.  15% HCL acid dumped directly to sand

1312 2018-12-12 21:27:17 Never accused the crowned Prince of murdering JK.The Prince has treated royal family members terribly. Our country has every right to decide who we deal with. We r the largest oil producer in the world. We don’t need KSA oil & r quite self sufficient. We r beholden to no country.
1313 2018-12-12 21:27:13 Late to reply by I STRONGLY suggest doubling down using your home as collateral. It's basically guaranteed wealth. You could then quit and start an oil company. #beckettfinancialservices
1314 2018-12-12 21:27:12 Thanks Sophie, had to respond at some point.  Any implication he found would be conceding facts.  My two statements are tough to contradict.  Insular?  Check.  Accept transfers despite “no social acceptance of oil”.  Check.  I might have forgotten hypocrisy.
1315 2018-12-12 21:27:08 There have never been peanut proteins in vaccines. There was a suggestion to use peanut oil as an adjuvant decades ago, but it was never put into practice.

1317 2018-12-12 21:26:55 I wish they were trying to kill the oil industry. 

Libs bought a pipeline, haven't changed NEB rules .. If it's anyone that's been in a coma it's you. Libs stupidly are trying to keep oil industry alive when we're 12 years away from losing the planet.
1318 2018-12-12 21:26:45 $AMRN @matthewherper My thoughts on Herper -- he's either a very selective parrot, or in somebody's pocket, or just plain unethical, or irresponsible. And considering that his full time profession is a 'journalist', he definitely created #FakeNews regarding mineral oil. Disgrace.

1321 2018-12-12 21:26:21 This problem is difficult. He’s preventing terrorists from increasing their own bank through oil sales, so even though this is an unfortunate outcome—to do the opposite is to help terrorism. He’s stuck on that & conservatives are taking advantage of that truth.

1323 2018-12-12 21:26:19 I say many words to ensure meaning is clear. Long ago Tesla had developed 2 major inventions. 1 was of the type that the govt desired its potential, the other was the type that the oil tycoons couldn’t allow to see the light of day. One is used today the other still hidden.
1324 2018-12-12 21:26:15 Got my second oil change of the year. Prior to that it was in 2014 when I last owned a car in Columbus

1327 2018-12-12 21:26:03 I don't really like oil painting but Prismacolors with layers and then you buff the top and seal it, BAM.
1328 2018-12-12 21:26:01 that doesn't sound nice, try to avoid those foods for a while and see what happens...was it too salty? had too much oil? Foods with salt or fat excess can cause headaches as well as stomach aches, anyways take care Cami ;;

But let's say you are right: you've just made every producer in Scotland uncompetitive in the market that provides more of their trade than the ROW combined.

1333 2018-12-12 21:25:35 I did an 80 well abandonment project last winter. Winter 2017 my team did over 300. Q2-Q4 2018 we've done another 70 with more planned. We're even doing wells that belonged to bankrupt producers on the oil company's $, because they don't think the public should pay. Why do u lie?

1335 2018-12-12 21:25:29 Arab oil money has bought western media.
1336 2018-12-12 21:25:26 I agree. I won't fly Delta either after that.
1337 2018-12-12 21:25:17 We won’t need other pipelines. The money that is currently being sent to Ottawa would stay in AB. We’ll continue to sell oil and gas to the US through the AB/US border. Think what that money could do, free post secondary, lowered taxes and more services.
1338 2018-12-12 21:25:16 He likes that "clean" Saudi and Venezuelan oil. Any higher carbon intenseness of Albertan oil is easily overwhelmed by the corruption inherent in these 2 countries. Alberta has some of the strictest environmental laws in the world. I've worked in industry and I know.
1339 2018-12-12 21:25:15 Yo trabajo en una Big Oil. Y me he topado con mierdas rollo "The Anatomy of a Con Job", que básicamente habla de illuminatis que controlan las reservas de crudo, que es "renovable" , que tienen un origen "primigenio" (como el magma por ejemplo) y que nunca se van a acabar.
1340 2018-12-12 21:25:12 What would a federal NDP government do to replace Alberta's oil revenue?
1341 2018-12-12 21:24:58 So, I grew up with my mom cutting tomatoes and cucumbers and garlic and mixing them with salt, pepper, two parts olive oil to one part vinegar. And it's good! And I make it. And I'm having a vicious craving for it.

1347 2018-12-12 21:24:33 Totally bro.  No way he did what he did for anything other than pay.  I would start at the top of $TSLAQ and work down.  Of course, it will all point to Big Oil and the Kochs in the end.
1348 2018-12-12 21:24:30 It just has my skin looking clear & clean. Plus my skin is really oily so it helped combat that excess oil.
1349 2018-12-12 21:24:29 I’ve read some people on CT suggest that Venezuela would benefit from bitcoin but I don’t see it. That’s just another fluctuating commodity they’d have to deal with it like oil. A real solution to their situation is the one nobody likes to suggest, political regime change.

1352 2018-12-12 21:23:44 In fairness he did negotiate a deal to overpay with our money by several billion dollars for an old leaky pipeline. So there’s that. At least his big oil puppet masters are happy.
1353 2018-12-12 21:23:29 Aside from hero movies, look at other fields. Like oil and gas, coffee, military(huge pay gaps) the current presidential admin. How many women are those fields compared to men?
1354 2018-12-12 21:23:26 You know, I can name 50 of his accomplishments but you are a hater just like most. We just became a net  oil exporter for first time in 75 years. Unemployed in every category lowest in 50 years. Your just a hater and Hrc would not have done this. Good luck with your hatred.

1358 2018-12-12 21:23:06 I'm not worried about global warming, because overpopulation, nuclear winter, the ozone hole, peak oil. nuclear meltdown, BSE, Swine Flu, acid rain, killer bees, Y2K Reagan's election and a few dozen other things - all killed us decades ago.
1359 2018-12-12 21:23:04 The wedding cost $1Million. The girls father is big into oil & telecom with a net worth of I believe $42 Billion. He is #17 ? on the worlds richest. HRC, Kerry & Huma were all at the wedding. No doubt a big donor to DNC or Clinton Foundation.
1360 2018-12-12 21:23:03 Geography demands a hard border at Hadrians to hold back the Wee Nippies trying to escape. Northumberland will become a free trade zone so the backwoods (gender fluid)"men"  can trade whisky for oil!
1361 2018-12-12 21:22:52 Given the already state of corruption prevailing in Uganda, you wait for the Oil Curse to kick in with a vengeance! It is not a maybe; it is guaranteed!
1362 2018-12-12 21:22:45 I won’t care at that point. Oil and gas will continue to be sold to the US, only now AB won’t contribute billions to Ottawa. That will leave money n the province. Free post secondary,  more services and less tax.
1363 2018-12-12 21:22:44 I think it might be the oil filter housing gasket, but there could also be more than one...  Weirdly, it doesn't seem to be losing much, but i leave my mark everywhere I park the thing.
1364 2018-12-12 21:22:43 Use ROSSY OIL FRAGRANCE and  build your self esteem.
1365 2018-12-12 21:22:33 And I will clarify - when I say some quakes are caused by fracking, it is primarily down to the changes of stresses on pre-existing faults due to the fracking process - injection & removal of water & gas/oil. The same occurs due to geothermal, water abstraction, mining, etc.

1368 2018-12-12 21:22:15 We had 13 Amendments that worked. So well, bankers and attorneys made hardly anything in the profession. Were known as grifters, or snake oil salesman.(whats changed?)Now, we have 27, and bankers, and attorneys are out of control. 13-up are without the peoples consent. Surprised?
1369 2018-12-12 21:22:10 As oil is all used up its prices will be out of control high and we will most likely turn to bio fuel so I’m not really concerned about green house gasses keep going up from oil and government should not control pricing unless in crisis

1371 2018-12-12 21:21:58 This shouldn’t be a partisan issue, but the vast majority of campaign donations from the oil industry go into the pockets of Republicans. And you think the scientific community is out to dominate us. One look at who you follow on here tells me all I need to know.
1372 2018-12-12 21:21:52 The problem there is fish oil was on the market prior to 1994, so no need for an NDI notification. CBD was never legally marketed in the US prior to 1994 as a supplement was it?
1373 2018-12-12 21:21:50 Found my Moroccan oil today!! Yasssssssss
1374 2018-12-12 21:21:45 This man has been saying open for business and red tape since he was hired for a job that 60% of the people didn't want him to have, and he still can't name a single thing he did to help those two things out.

Because he sells fucking SNAKE OIL.
1375 2018-12-12 21:21:44 So happy the snake oil salesman has now blocked me as i no longer have to see his dirge. He seems to hate people stating accurate things about his clear failings in knowledge on every subject he decides to write about every week
1376 2018-12-12 21:20:58 Can I fry turkey with oil I just used to fry plantain?!
1377 2018-12-12 21:20:58 My pal @DashMartin suggested I try color pencils for similar effect when I talked about wanting to do some stuff in the style of those He-Man oil paintings I RT.
1378 2018-12-12 21:20:52 I compare it to Lovasa, a prescription fish oil and health food stores still being able to sell over the counter fish oil. I hope I'm not over simplifying it. (in my mind lol).

1383 2018-12-12 21:20:09 This is why you don't have any friends. Dial back the frothing twat and turn up the reading comprehension. Oil companies do pay to clean up their messes. Quite handsomely. I know this because I'm paid to direct such projects. Quite handsomely. But w/e keep bullshitting people

1390 2018-12-12 21:19:42 You are absolutely right. This is truth I grew up knowing, raw truth. And I'm grateful for it. Oil companies and bankers own us, and this world. They are international bankers, they are not part of our Federal government, but they sell us our money back. Energy is a weapon.
1391 2018-12-12 21:19:31 OH they will. Mexico highest income just second to Oil? Western Union. Just the costs of Illegals of 10s of billions a year.

1397 2018-12-12 21:18:42 Venezuela is a good case study in why it’s never a good idea to tie a countries vitality to a fluctuating market commodity. the decline of oil prices in that country really exasperated its political problems. unfortunate for those who live there.

That would kill our economy.
When will liberals start care about US!
1412 2018-12-12 21:17:33 1. animal agriculture LiTeRaLly accounts for over 70% of that destruction. they better ban animal products then
2. palm oil has the highest yield per crop any other oils would cause far more deforestation
3. most palm oil goes to energy not food. you better not use any power

1435 2018-12-12 21:14:07 Even today's Jif contains additives and palm oil. Not sure where you grew up, but I've found that some northern baking recipes don't turn out the same in FL. Humidity maybe? Altitude?
1436 2018-12-12 21:13:59 You have stretch marks. It's actually more common to have stretch marks than to not have any at all. Breasts grow fast and change sizes over the course of your life. If you hate their appearance, they'll fade and applying rosehip oil will speed the process. #your
1437 2018-12-12 21:13:53 I have decided I'm not sure I want to know what he is using all of that fresh squirrel oil for.
1438 2018-12-12 21:13:40 Let's just skip the middle man and end lobbying altogether. Then, perhaps Big Oil will take those billions and use them towards actually fixing the problems they're causing the environment rather than as payoffs to avoid focusing on them.
1439 2018-12-12 21:13:38 Yup. Problem is (1) we deep fry them in oil or add half and pound of butter and salt to them. (2) the sheer volume of them we eat as a “portion” e.g 3/4/500 g per sitting. Imagine eating that much cabbage/lettuce/carrots/broccoli
1440 2018-12-12 21:13:27 Yes the cuts have helped some but the NDP and the Liberals created this issue with their stance against the oil industry.
1441 2018-12-12 21:13:19 Getting ready to fix up oil samples to mail out for the first of the year.
1442 2018-12-12 21:13:11 if chimps go extinct it will be due to animal agriculture, you know, the reason for over 70% of rainforest destruction, not palm oil. you stupid fuck.
1443 2018-12-12 21:13:07 Simplest thing ever.
Boil pasta.
Heat garlic in oil/butter - add small pot of fresh picked crab.
Boil and cut peas/sugar snaps.
Mix it all together.
1444 2018-12-12 21:12:59 She only recently made the flip flop to support oil because the NDP realizes how it generates jobs and drives the economy. She is a wolf in sheep’s clothing!

1454 2018-12-12 21:12:18 I get it but collecting the oil lamps are useful and pretty safer than candles in a lot of way just doing what you can remember our grandparents did not have the trinkets we have and did survive even in the city 
People help people 
1455 2018-12-12 21:12:17 Don't market yourself as a brand & then catch feelings when your credibility comes into question. Remember BPs oil spill? That's etched into their credibility as a brand & people's actions are no different. Don't cry change & growth when consequences come to nest, it doesn't work
1456 2018-12-12 21:12:11 Yeah and now Venezuela people are starving even with vast oil resources but I’m sure that capitalism fault. Yikes
1457 2018-12-12 21:12:06 This is a triumph of the free market, Cons should be celebrating this cuz free market something something. Funny how I never once heard “Harper buys Saudi oil” given that this has been going on for years.

"HAH-"

Laughs at the downed titan.
1461 2018-12-12 21:11:19 I’m looking specifically at the “mineral oil” opinion.  The science goes against the “idea”, so it’s bias and logically incorrect...
1462 2018-12-12 21:11:16 So yesterday I went to get an oil change at the dealership (9 am). When I went to pick up my car they couldn’t locate it. They finally found my car but “lost” my car keys. They found the keys in one of the employees pockets. It was all very sketchy. This all lasted 3 hours.
1463 2018-12-12 21:11:09 Is Dan's 'hangover cure' made from snake oil? #theapprentice
1464 2018-12-12 21:11:05 Now say the same thing about the corn subsidy or the subsidy paid to the oil guys....no?

1466 2018-12-12 21:10:59 Agreed Tarek ...XLE is at similar support too we just need oil to get off the ground..
1467 2018-12-12 21:10:26 It would wash of him like oil on water though.

1472 2018-12-12 21:09:43 D central Govt of @JustinTrudeau should try to lend a helping hand to d provincial Govt of Alberta led by #RachelRotney in her effort to find value for their oil

1487 2018-12-12 21:08:10 Sure it does. The only way to stop ppl from illegally entering is to accept every single one that shows up. Reform won't accomplish this unless it includes unlimited immigration, and we are not going to increase by 100% or more.

1497 2018-12-12 21:07:03 If Nova Scotia and New Brunswick didn’t receive equalization they would 100 percent have to develop there onshore gas resources.  Collecting equalization payments from mostly oil and gas gives Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick freedom not to develop there resources.

1500 2018-12-12 21:06:27 Not sure what argument you are making there.  Oil money goes to Quebec in the form of equalization.
1501 2018-12-12 21:06:17 A nigga can’t check his oil in piece, I swear 
1502 2018-12-12 21:06:15 Perhaps he can get a group of people together, and when asked,  can reply that he takes $$ from employees of Gas and Oil companies
1503 2018-12-12 21:06:14 そうそう！

1505 2018-12-12 21:05:43 I use the snowblower...or at least change the oil once in a while.  Or hang up Christmas lights.

1508 2018-12-12 21:05:31 Come all the way clean, National Enquirer. How frequently do you engage in cover-ups on behalf of the highest bidder, you festering pools of sun-soaked turd oil?

Inquiring minds want to know.
1509 2018-12-12 21:05:31 Mine is that it is inherently unsafe.  Oil and gas are bad for the environment but can be filtered and its impa t reduced.  Fukashima will affect life for hundreds of years.  They still cannot get inside to cap off the radiation leaks.  Nuclear is not worth the risk.
1510 2018-12-12 21:05:30 I've got a very busy day tomorrow so going in with bad head and listening to bindippers and oil city deffo won't help 
1511 2018-12-12 21:05:23 I apologize for my PM comments about Alberta oil.  Of course we have hydro and in surplus now that gas is cheap,  but as long as we burn oil, it should come from you.  Not from a foreign nation.
1512 2018-12-12 21:05:20 it was just a jar of coconut oil
1513 2018-12-12 21:05:16 I have to get my oil change today and my detail.
1514 2018-12-12 21:05:05 あっ勘違いしてるかも、前みたいに100円みたいなんもらって買うんじゃなくて前買ってたやつの逆バージョンみたいなのが貰える。
1515 2018-12-12 21:05:02 A 4am food truck called Strong Desire where you yell at people with megaphones after massaging beards with coconut oil
1516 2018-12-12 21:04:56 Yeah! And make Whale Oil Great Again!
1517 2018-12-12 21:04:37 I suppose we could implement some kind of national policy on energy to ensure oil consumed in Canada is domestically produced.
1518 2018-12-12 21:04:37 Oil is the past, move on...
1519 2018-12-12 21:04:36 Why u getting yo oil changed monthly
1520 2018-12-12 21:04:22 It’s oil nigga”
1521 2018-12-12 21:04:11 Just because these regions didn't vote for you  doesn't mean you keep sidelining them like they re non Nigerians, yet d oil revenue you enjoy comes from S'South, tomorrow you will send EFCC to investigate without them having any representative in d board & you think it's fair
1522 2018-12-12 21:04:08 Yesss 50% all conditioners and treatments lol I got hella leave ins, oil and deep conditioners!
1523 2018-12-12 21:04:06 I truly just do not know. *lathers coconut oil on*
1524 2018-12-12 21:04:02 thank you girl!!! we’ve been using cbd oil and cut the medication dosage to once a day he is THRIVING
1525 2018-12-12 21:03:49 Nothing $50,000 won't remedy.
1526 2018-12-12 21:03:45 If concern for the environment didn't stop the oil age, I doubt it will stop the EV age.
1527 2018-12-12 21:03:44 Yes mate.  

Iran is an oil producer.  The currency of oil trade is USD.  And almost every dollar transferred through banks are cleared through NY.  

So yes, it makes sense that they have USD bank accounts
1528 2018-12-12 21:03:42 Sí, el Peak Oil disfrazado.
1529 2018-12-12 21:03:38 Skinny tan oil!!!!! Amazing!!!!!!
1530 2018-12-12 21:03:37 Thats why you yellow like spoilt palm oil
1531 2018-12-12 21:03:20 Why car service places always tryin to get me to spend like $300 on some bullshit?
Like yo, let me tell you a secret.
I have $5 after this oil change bruh.
Try the next white girl that walks in?

1532 2018-12-12 21:03:14 いつまでかは知らん！
1533 2018-12-12 21:02:39 Shame on EVERY low morals person who supports a married SELF-PROFESSED p***y grabbing NY Snake Oil Salesman. This country deserved better. Half the blame goes to Individual-1​ and the other half goes to his brainwashed Un-american Cult 45 followers!
1534 2018-12-12 21:02:35 The most devastating feeling is when a curly haired person forgets a hair product on the road. My Moroccan oil was substituted with a concoction of lotion and conditioner #Macgyver
1535 2018-12-12 21:02:29 No we don't.  As long as we need oil, it must come from Canada.
Btw, our 2 refineries in Quebec are already using Alberta oil.
1536 2018-12-12 21:02:23 .@canardenchaine Caracas should sign a deal with French Antilles providing the Islands with oil paid in Euros, the said Islands soon could become an Oil Hub
1537 2018-12-12 21:02:15 I've heard of that but haven't tried it before. I'm always confused about the proportion of the sugar and oil.
1538 2018-12-12 21:02:04 self care goals in 2019 is buying $50 rose body oil without blinking
1539 2018-12-12 21:02:03 I hope you are referring to the endless sunshine as opposed to the oil buried under the ground. #ActOnClimate
1540 2018-12-12 21:01:57 AND the government is still trying to TAKE BACK and BUILD ON their sacred grounds that we “gave” to them even tho we murdered them and stole it from them in the first place. a fucking oil pipeline? really? gross.
1541 2018-12-12 21:01:47 It’s about destabilization of a military alliance that’s been in place for a while also an attempt to destabilize the oil market as well. The left and media WANT for him to dump a long term alliance to destabilize the entire region and economic markets worldwide.
1542 2018-12-12 21:01:35 前にとってたやつの逆のやつが貰えるで！
1543 2018-12-12 21:01:31 Lol no, but you can order that or anything else well done, they just drop them in the oil twice
1544 2018-12-12 21:01:23 Thinking that the jerks of the world have been filtered out by the spirit of good government for the sake of civility, & social progress.
I trust I'll be working w/awesome folk. Still got my guard up.
Taking on big oil, & agribusiness is a big deal.
I think I just created my job.
1545 2018-12-12 21:01:21 Senator David Tkachuk giving a barn-burner of a speech on the ill-conceived Bill C-69. His description of a life without oil reminds me a bit of that Simpson's episode with the school film about life without zinc. Only Bill C-69 is not comedy, it's tragedy. #SenCA #Cdnpoli
1546 2018-12-12 21:01:17 Coconut oil? 
1547 2018-12-12 21:01:07 If you get your nose pierced make sure you clean it, you can put tea tree oil on it every other day and nothing should pop up on your nose. & as far as makeup I always just clean the actual piercing after I do my makeup so there won’t be any on the piercing, & the whole is small
1548 2018-12-12 21:00:43 We are no longer dependent on foreign oil

1550 2018-12-12 21:00:28 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1551 2018-12-12 21:00:23 More to the point, I think it gives the people who live there a sense of value/entitlement that they are not actually entitled to, since they didn't do a gd thing to create the oil.
1552 2018-12-12 21:00:18 Becuz all Canadians are happy with Liberals, eh? Mistake made with stupidity that great Alberta “people” own the resource hence rapacious Alberta Crown Royalty revenue tax. Without it, Albertans drooling on their shirts not in the oil biz wudn’t think they are so smart. #cdnpoli
1553 2018-12-12 21:00:17 im so sad , i saw @beautybakerie was having a sale & i NEED their Wake & Bake Baking Oil ... tell me why it’s SOLD OUT ! 
1554 2018-12-12 21:00:13 dah...do you think pipelines are safer than trains transporting oil through school zones.....
1555 2018-12-12 20:59:57 I still don’t know how to prepare proper party jollof rice. Should I be bothered? 

The closest I’ve gone is the red oil peppered rice that has fish scattered in it & that’s it.
1556 2018-12-12 20:59:54 You need the soap first to cut the oil m. If you try wetting your hair then shampooing it doesn’t seem to get the oil out of your head so your hair might look greasy but smell great!!
1557 2018-12-12 20:59:31 congrats to Q walking away before Calipari sells him more snake oil
1558 2018-12-12 20:59:29 For me I'm a sucker for dark beers, the darker the better, I'm fond of frankencense or myrr or cypress oil, fucking love chocolate, and obsidian.
1559 2018-12-12 20:59:16 And Coconut oil in hand
1560 2018-12-12 20:59:00 Trying to go #lactofree and decided to make pasta bake with a "mozzarella" topping. The cheese was made from coconut oil and all I could taste was coconuts. It doesn't even have the same texture. Not impressed 
1561 2018-12-12 20:58:57 I’m 6’3 with long ass arms. Your oil is meaningless before me
1562 2018-12-12 20:58:57 Listening to TAZ makes me want to play D&D. I have a character pretty much all set up. Assassin rogue, with some illusion magic. Burn scars all over, violet eyes, freckles, her rose oil perfume is a calling card. Super duper bisexual. Allergic to tomatoes, but still eats them.
1563 2018-12-12 20:58:54 The biggest profiteers from oil are individual states & the federal government.

1566 2018-12-12 20:58:42 Oil!
1567 2018-12-12 20:58:39 He was wearing oil. According to Ellie’s mittens, enough to to equivalent another layer of skin maybe? BTW I am criticising no one here. If he would like to give me a lap dance I can send him my address.
1568 2018-12-12 20:58:36 I’ve used it as a hair conditioner covering your hair and leaving it on for a few minutes. Or put plastic bag over it &use blow drier to heat the oil.  Then I put shampoo wth a little water in my palms rub that into a lather  as you want the shampoo directly on hair before water
1569 2018-12-12 20:58:33 Question for my friends who are smarter than I am (so all of you):

what's your opinion on nuclear energy?
what are its prospects?
nuclear energy vs. oil and gas?
1570 2018-12-12 20:58:31 You welcome. Always remember,  sugar dipped in palm oil is more effective than coflin
1571 2018-12-12 20:58:26 My bubble is facts and figures, not whatever some silver spooned snake oil selling grifter or his lackeys say.

Good luck to you, God bless 
1572 2018-12-12 20:58:23 London wants new North Atlantic Union with Norway and Iceland. Thousands Billions of $ Oil resources and powerful NATO alliance. #Brexit
1573 2018-12-12 20:58:07 Huge mistake. Oil will go much higher. Opec disbands and says not selling anything to USA.
1574 2018-12-12 20:58:05 Rub oil of oregano on your feet and put on warm socks for sleeping. Really helps kick the crud from my boys when they get sick. Also, is a natural anti biotic.
1575 2018-12-12 20:57:48 Actually oil on paper as I ran out of materials!
1576 2018-12-12 20:57:40 just realised my lavender oil says not to use on skin... just put loads on my neck... as I do...every night...

1578 2018-12-12 20:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1579 2018-12-12 20:57:36 By now, most adults know that risks from rail transport of oil are high while pipelines have close to zero.  So why does your cohort want pipelines banned?  Got a thing about supporting Saudis?
1580 2018-12-12 20:57:28 I  you throwing oil to the fire Lonzen 
1581 2018-12-12 20:57:12 They also have a ban on hydraulic fracturing why would they produce there own oil when they collect equalization.Same goes for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  They are welfare provinces that just want to sit back and take advantage of Western Canada. Equalization is unproductive
1582 2018-12-12 20:57:11 Had some carrot & Swede mash too. I prep my veg hours before sprouts in butter garlic chilli flakes. Carrots butter lemon juice marmalade. All nice and crispy. Pork fried in butter, oil, lime,bbq seasoning & worcs sauce and Garvey made with juices.
1583 2018-12-12 20:57:04 This statement is misleading. The prices at the pump (+heating oil & natural gas) will go up. Full stop. So this creates an economic incentive to reduce consumption of polluting fuels, by charging for the externalities of climate change which have not been factored in currently.
1584 2018-12-12 20:57:02 Any Goodman making mincemeat out of Reince Priebus reject coal and oil and gas  promoter!
1585 2018-12-12 20:56:43 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1586 2018-12-12 20:56:13 when I was in turkey, they of course had amazing grain salads kind of like tabouleh everywhere.  The more touristy places included a green salad on the side of most entrees, but clearly didn't understand why or what else you needed.  we had to learn how to say "oil and vinegar"
1587 2018-12-12 20:56:04 I'm really enjoying my E39 525, except the mystery oil leak, and the averaging 21mpg.
1588 2018-12-12 20:56:02 Look at this from a different perspective: people are getting tired of brand accounts and brand ambassador personalities.
I think it's perfectly okay if a prominent SEO expert  tweets about how they got an oil change the other day.

1590 2018-12-12 20:55:39 Great. Now I want a slim oil dispenser glass bottle too.  Damn it, monies couldn’t fly out of my wallet any faster.
1591 2018-12-12 20:55:31 Better smell than burned rubber from or oil spilled on an f1 engine?
1592 2018-12-12 20:55:31 Reward our prized oil and gas sector for their continued advancements in environmental stewardship (we are the best in the world and should be proud).
1593 2018-12-12 20:55:15 So hoping @RepPerlmutter and @DianaDeGette can join @JoeNeguse. Colorado’s economy is more snow dependent than oil dependent, we need to respond to climate change. This would help us on many levels.
1594 2018-12-12 20:55:14 Took my baby to Jiffy Lube. First time in my life I didn’t do the oil myself. I feel..... hollow and dirty.
1595 2018-12-12 20:55:02 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
1596 2018-12-12 20:54:51 It’s the oil lobbyist that are trying to stop Tesla. Tesla is an American car. And helps the environment. If you can buy a Tesla.

1598 2018-12-12 20:54:43 THANK YOU ANGIE!!! Society6 stuff is stupidly awesome! It looks like real oil on canvas 

The only thing that bothers me is that the saturation of the drawing isn’t the same as digital and looks faded, and a bit dark. Btw I'm very happy XD
1599 2018-12-12 20:54:43 Are you aware that the second largest source of reveneue for the entire country of Mexico, second only to oil, is money sent back from the US? if we shut that spicket off their economy would collapse. They will do whatever we ask to keep the American dollars flowing.
1600 2018-12-12 20:54:41 Reuters- Former PDVSA President and oil minister Nelson Martinez, imprisoned by Nicolas Maduro's government, has died -sources
1601 2018-12-12 20:54:38 Are you kidding me? They've reopened five steel plants and are building four more. Two aluminum reopened and 1 new. Oil production is at the highest in 75 yrs. 6 coal mines reopened and several more being restructured to be opened next yr

1603 2018-12-12 20:54:18 Must admit I stopped buying this brand of chocolate when the acquisition of the original company led to a complete loss of jobs in the UK when a promise of keeping them was made to Parliament.  The palm oil and changed taste just put the final nail in the Cadbury coffin.
1604 2018-12-12 20:54:14 That's not a forecast... that's just a flat line with a little bit of industry optimism attached. #oil
1605 2018-12-12 20:54:12 Agreed. Perhaps if you backed banning of off shore drilling of oil the world itself wouldn't be as sick.
1606 2018-12-12 20:54:11 Was the oil sourced from Petroecuador?
1607 2018-12-12 20:54:02 Listening to Miss Jimmy Crankie of the SNP, frankly, I’d call for an English vote for a decision as to whether we “want to rid ourselves” of Scotland! No gas, no oil, survive without us!!

1615 2018-12-12 20:52:50 I’m kinda at a loss on this one. I bought an oil change at the Valvoline place in town during the HOPE in Lancaster benefit  auction and the new owner won’t honor the full amount. Here I thought Lancaster people were known for giving. Oh well, they just lost one steady customer.
1616 2018-12-12 20:52:42 King of “Aht Aht! Don’t touch that! I said change my oil!” 
1617 2018-12-12 20:52:37 Oh. Our 8 year old daughter wants to know too. She’s recently been elected to the Environment Committee in primary school and is checking ingredients on everything. ‘Why does all the stuff that tastes good have palm oil?’ Answer?????
1618 2018-12-12 20:52:25 Iran had a functioning democracy which the USA took down because they want oil profits for the Iranian people, not foreign oil companies.  They replaced the democracy with the Sha who was a cruel, oppressive leader.  That’s why they don’t like us.
1619 2018-12-12 20:52:06 Mine and @Jemmamchurchill’s dressing room @nativityuk is smelling delightful this evening, courtesy of @thewhitecompany ‘Winter’ fragrance oil!! Thanks @AndyBrady23 for treating us! 
1620 2018-12-12 20:52:05 I have and I loved them! Just do a lot of research on the places you are looking into. The chemical that they use could be dangerest to your eyes. You also can use mascara but it has to be oil free if you end up going out out instead of just to work
1621 2018-12-12 20:52:02 Speaking of GRAVY TRAIN

1622 2018-12-12 20:51:57 The trump administration allowing for seismic blasting to look for oil and gas off the east coast in clear violation of the marine mammal act.
1623 2018-12-12 20:51:44 Napa carries the correct oil I've found, just in very limited supply
1624 2018-12-12 20:51:30 Everything about Nigeria budgets is depending on oil. Everyone campaign for election is eyes the oil. Why? Let there be resource control.
1625 2018-12-12 20:51:25 i'm waiting for my car while it gets an oil change im in a weird mood
1626 2018-12-12 20:51:25 Yooo I just checked my oil for the first time I been driving ever.... like ever... #lilmilestones
1627 2018-12-12 20:51:22 It is a never ending rotation of woo and snake oil...
1628 2018-12-12 20:51:18 Invest in joint wraps, or the oil pen it’s safer
1629 2018-12-12 20:51:11 Abokina y na?
1630 2018-12-12 20:51:03 おぉ～(゜〇゜;)
1631 2018-12-12 20:51:01 Champions League is not a trophy for oil the sponsored teams.
1632 2018-12-12 20:50:50 This is so absurd.  I suppose the path of least intelligence is to double down on your reliably inaccurate predictions? Is this some "speak it into existence" snake oil?
1633 2018-12-12 20:50:42 I am so glad you found something that has helped. I just started taking cannabis oil, and it has helped so much with anxiety.
1634 2018-12-12 20:50:40 If we stopped demanding palm oil he/she would be in their natural habitat
1635 2018-12-12 20:50:39 There are myriads of ways in which images can be processed. What I am doing is experimenting with a particular tool, how it could be useful in my work process. When you are learning to paint with egg tempera, it does not help to talk about oil pastels.
1636 2018-12-12 20:50:39 that’s a good idea. or find a brand of candle that actually puts a decent amount of oil in
1637 2018-12-12 20:50:29 If you got time and data check of a few YouTube vids on 4c hair and essensial oils. The cheapest ones I know to are olive oil and grapeseed oil. Make sure they are 100% or closest to it organic so olive oil will probably be extra virgin, grapeseed is available a t Dis-Chem 1/2
1638 2018-12-12 20:50:26 And my scalp just so irritated as well so I stop putting oil on it because it wasn’t helping I’ve been using aloe Vera gel and it’s feels so much better
1639 2018-12-12 20:50:11 Saddest Christmas I have ever seen on the streets and many other public places in #venezuela not a single light sales crushed no xmas spirit whatsoever.. most visible face of a deep crisis in the largest oil reserve in the world.. #oott hope for better times to come..
1640 2018-12-12 20:50:02 As soon as you feel the tingling feeling on your lip, press an ice cube on it for as long as you can. It’ll burn, yes, but it prevents it from growing even uglier! 

Peppermint essential oil works too! 
I personally do the ice cube & use campho-phenique (Walmart/Target) !:)
1641 2018-12-12 20:49:58 *forgets to take my #CBD oil consistently*

1642 2018-12-12 20:49:44 Also, have any of you had a salad there? I was at a dinner party where the salad was a slice of iceberg, 1/4 of a tomato, and white vinaigre and olive oil.
1643 2018-12-12 20:49:42 oh damn ill stick to my toms for the time being then, tea tree oil breaks me out so much. and cleansing body wash!

1645 2018-12-12 20:49:30 Lolololol.... the NFL speech is quintessential beto feelings snake oil. When Barack was running, I thought his stuff sounded idiotic, but no one listened. Then, we got 8 years of incompetence. Let's not do that again.
1646 2018-12-12 20:49:27 Oil prices traded higher and were supported by a drop in U.S. crude inventories and an OPEC-led deal to trim output. U.S. crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week through December 7th
1647 2018-12-12 20:49:22 The threshing floors shall be full of grain; the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.

1649 2018-12-12 20:49:18 @JakeHurwitz invents Hardwon’s beard oil on the latest episode of #NADDPod and all I can think is : Christmas is coming...   
Maybe bottle Beverly’s musk as perfume. Have yourself a nice bathroom gift set. 
1650 2018-12-12 20:49:17 Oil bae
1651 2018-12-12 20:49:16 If you find oil, drink it
1652 2018-12-12 20:49:14 I’ve resulted to using reed diffusers and oil diffusers instead because they work so much better
1653 2018-12-12 20:49:09 They represent a pro-native oil pipeline company, so they may be a little bit biased.
1654 2018-12-12 20:49:07 it’s a struggle when your car needs an oil change & you don’t know shit about cars & you have to figure it out on your own

1658 2018-12-12 20:48:54 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
1659 2018-12-12 20:48:45 Getting my oil changed rn, I swear to GOD, I HAAAAATE anywhere.
1660 2018-12-12 20:48:34 -chamomile (yes, i know its controversial)
-lavender oil
-stickers 
-master & margarita (or a recording of my bf reading it to me)
-gossip girl
-fuzzy socks
-sweetener album
-my makeup bag
-"Gouzentine" liturgical music
1661 2018-12-12 20:48:25 Yep. I went to the Tesla museum in Belgrade,  Serbia. Apart from that my father was part of a team around 15 years ago that produced underwater WIFI. Mainly used by oil and gas industry. Nonetheless humankind have been supressed for at least 100 years ( technology wise)
1662 2018-12-12 20:48:10 @ScottyGZone there is not any oil on the moon because you need carbon-based materials in order to make fossil fuels AKA oil. That's why we're more interested in Mars. Signs of Life. Carbon is essential in creating life.
1663 2018-12-12 20:48:08 I wouldn’t with the coconut  oil! Just one spritz and they were licking themselves like crazy afterwards then the fur balls started
1664 2018-12-12 20:47:55 thats fucking motor oil
1665 2018-12-12 20:47:55 And those who used the oil money to do frivolous things like bus branding nkor? How do we refer to them? And those who wasted the taxpayers money to take Akua Donkor on foreign trips, gave her a house and 2 SUVs?
1666 2018-12-12 20:47:52 I bet he doesn't. The snake oil probably oozes into the cup.
1667 2018-12-12 20:47:32 they want the oil in Russia to sell
1668 2018-12-12 20:47:24  He come out on the oil?
1669 2018-12-12 20:47:13 Hehe I just bought oil on amazon
1670 2018-12-12 20:47:07 I used G&W anf Oil Panicked my way Through the Mega's
1671 2018-12-12 20:47:00 Use to rock cologne until i got hip to oil
1672 2018-12-12 20:46:58 My Impala has almost 200,000 miles on it should I be thinking about changing over to synthetic oil?
1673 2018-12-12 20:46:56 shove your money and your oil and your jewels and that directly up your ass and stop destroying the only planet we have to live on...this planet was beautiful and your fucking it up...just stop money is not worth extinction of the animals or the human race...use your brains...
1674 2018-12-12 20:46:53 This is the most embarrassing oil change I've ever had omfg
1675 2018-12-12 20:46:52 oh and IDS, the large majority of Venezuela’s problem are directly linked oil, its economy, it’s US sanctions all linked to oil! So you are either a liar as you know this or completely incompetent given yr current and former positions in government and you should know this!
1676 2018-12-12 20:46:43 What if it has oil and the U.S. comes after me? I can't escape this
1677 2018-12-12 20:46:33 It’s called fracking,drilling for oil sideways (I think that’s how they drill) I read were it’s bad and it causes earthquakes
1678 2018-12-12 20:46:32 The state has not told me shit. The left piles on regulation, which necessitates government growth. Banks, oil companies and private property rights all existed before government regulation. Insurance companies came into being when government regulated the health care industry
1679 2018-12-12 20:46:17 Saudi oil is unethical! Alberta transfer payments are ethical? Canadians should stop buying stuff made in Quebec until they want to be part of confederation!
1680 2018-12-12 20:46:10 I’m out of oil 
1681 2018-12-12 20:45:58 Well, politics is everywhere, in stock markets too. Trump is very emotional sometimes and his positions towards China are a risk for businesses that are dependent of that market. Oil is always influenced because of geopolitics, and it influences USD too (petrodollars).
1682 2018-12-12 20:45:33 Spice up your sex life with a massage oil!
1683 2018-12-12 20:45:31 Not the damn coconut oil!
1684 2018-12-12 20:45:24 "But we CAN'T go investigate the secret of old mill, Joe," said 18 year old Frank as he checked the oil of his jalopy.
"I know!" said his 17 year old brother Joe, affixing wax paper to a pocket comb for a makeshift harmonica. "We've got detention all week!"

1688 2018-12-12 20:44:57 Currency exists as a medium of exchange for trade. However, if our currency is only based upon the value of a commodity you don't own, ie petroleum, then valuation of that commodity become paramount for national stability. Hence the wars to prevent oil sold in other currency.
1689 2018-12-12 20:44:55 CBD oil
1690 2018-12-12 20:44:55 The long term viable answer atleast is  Space contains 99.999% of all the material resources we need. It's expensive to start up, but once accessed it will be as we have it right now as on earth because of abundance.
Given enough time and money to technology= oil&coal-->obsolete
1691 2018-12-12 20:44:45 i waited too long to get an oil change 
1692 2018-12-12 20:44:39 Considering the topic was climate change I falsely assumed you could figure it out. Does the US subsidize big oil or do they just give them tax breaks?  Not saying either is justified, just asking.
1693 2018-12-12 20:44:30 We've got all of those oil rigs getting decommissioned.  Just retrofit a few of them, prod them on with tasers, then tow them out to deep water.

And sink them.
1694 2018-12-12 20:44:08 thank youuuuu boo  i’ve been using castor oil for my lashes to help them grow and it’s been working 
1695 2018-12-12 20:44:08 AutoFarm has a position open for a full-time oil and lube technician, interested applicants should apply in person and speak with our service manager.
1696 2018-12-12 20:44:07 (Where ‘pursuing work’ = ‘selling snake oil er access’ ... if only there were rules against stuff)
1697 2018-12-12 20:43:54 I use it too. It does the same for my skin. But I never tried a coconut oil bath.  ima try it.
1698 2018-12-12 20:43:39 We as those who believe in Christ are also the light/luminaries.

In ourselves we have no light.
The light comes from oil, the Spirit, burning within us.

The source of our light is not ourselves, but Christ as the Spirit.
1699 2018-12-12 20:43:36 But we're expanding oil.
1700 2018-12-12 20:43:34 Or go talk to the countless veterans who have faced the potential of felony charges for being pulled over with marijuana oil they purchased legally from Colorado in order to get off of opioids and manage the pain they experience on a daily basis from injuries while in service.
1701 2018-12-12 20:43:31 I am kinda old school and I live in the rural areas
 We have a well and w have a hand pump just in case have canned lots of food have hurricane lamps with lots of oil and wicks well I don't see the need for a faraday cage but we will be ok
1702 2018-12-12 20:43:30 Yes lovely, but i see it is still packed with unrecyclable black plastic and does it contain palm oil?
1703 2018-12-12 20:43:24 cedarwood oil is my newest ting
1704 2018-12-12 20:43:18 Obviously I needed it! I just wanted to buy my coffee so I could work while I waited for my car to get its oil changed. Is that so much to ask for?

(Apparently yes, it is.)
1705 2018-12-12 20:43:08 Um i LOVE grapeseed oil ... like its up there w/ coconut 
1706 2018-12-12 20:43:08 Lmao why every time i get my oil change they tell me i need a new air filter 
1707 2018-12-12 20:43:04 My face breaks out so bad too I just tell them to not use the oil to use alcohol to get the excess wax off& I don’t break out.
1708 2018-12-12 20:43:03 The entire thing boils down to silliness.
In order to reject the scientific consensus on glyphosate presumably you rely on some variation of “paid off scientists” but how to explain consensus on climate change given the vast financial power of the oil industry.
1709 2018-12-12 20:43:02 Don't oppose Canadian pipelines.  Oppose the US who are trying to stop their construction.  Embrace pipelines that help get Canadian crude oil to tide water.
1710 2018-12-12 20:43:01 At least do some stretches and warm  compressions or something for your back. And take your fish oil!!!!
1711 2018-12-12 20:42:55 What HAS happened to Scotland’s oil wealth? Norway has a huge oil fund from which everyone benefits, what have we done with Scottish oil besides making a gift of it to the speculators in the south?
1712 2018-12-12 20:42:50 Sometimes I think about the story in the Bible where the woman’s olive oil never ran out and I wish I had that with Waffles fries
1713 2018-12-12 20:42:45 i use drops of my rosemary essential oil (I bot it before I knew it was bad) in my hot chocolate it’s so so good lol...(I also know you shouldn’t dilute it in water but idc)
1714 2018-12-12 20:42:30 مساء الخير 
1715 2018-12-12 20:42:30 UK is the financial hub second to USA. So naturally they want our oil because they are stuck with importing from Saudi or from Russia. So better tell JT to buckle up for energy expansion.
1716 2018-12-12 20:42:26 Until a pipeline is allowed to pass thru Quebec, Irving will keep on buying Saudi's Blood Oil.
1717 2018-12-12 20:42:25 How quickly can we scale that industry,  what’s the global growth for renewables and when will renewables pass oil in the global market?
1718 2018-12-12 20:42:22 “Oil” is a finite resource & the central focus of the statement
1719 2018-12-12 20:42:05 Cheers G  Yes mate, when i was looking into it that was recommended as an added layer of protection (was needed on this job) but have to keep in mind 24 hours before applying top oil
1720 2018-12-12 20:42:00 AutoFarm has a position open for a full-time oil and lube technician, interested applicants should apply in person and speak with our service manager.
1721 2018-12-12 20:42:00 The guy at the shop said it’d be 45 until he could do my oil change... now do you think I stayed and waited patiently for my turn? Absolutely fucking not. Guess we’ll try this again tomorrow.
1722 2018-12-12 20:41:44 Shockingly I just got the oil change and nothing more lol phew
1723 2018-12-12 20:41:25 Oil pressure sensor problems!
1724 2018-12-12 20:41:14 I’m worried it might be banned from our house soon. The 6 year old has been learning about palm oil and the orangutans at school and now peruses the list of ingredients on everything and shouts at me if there’s palm oil in it
1725 2018-12-12 20:41:13 Im hungry, ran out of q-tips, need an oil change, my gas light is on, I'm tired of working, and I have like $7, but it's all okay because I finished the semester and didn't fail a single class
1726 2018-12-12 20:41:09 A vial of oil labelled “Tomonari’s anointmente forr long swordes and other weppons of the disttinguished nobelemann.”
1727 2018-12-12 20:40:34 DOD weapons contractors and oil merchants . . . What more do you need in America?
1728 2018-12-12 20:40:17 Haha ..re quert lol ...yer work 4 letter word only for another  4 years then "retire " lol atb heid
1729 2018-12-12 20:40:15 Oil money they spent it better. Or rather didn't use it to fund tax cuts and built a huge sovereign fund
1730 2018-12-12 20:40:13 No plan Scheer.

No climate plan, no housing crisis plan, no opioid crisis plan, no jobs plan (except shoveling more taxpayer $$$ into a dying oil industry), no Indigenous People's plan.

The guy stands for nothing and has no plan for issues important to Canadians. #cdnpoli
1731 2018-12-12 20:40:06 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1732 2018-12-12 20:40:04 Family Nutrition: Mountain Dew this December? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1733 2018-12-12 20:39:40 Steel, aluminum, coal, oil, tech, all had huge growth.
1734 2018-12-12 20:39:38 dial's orange soap with marula oil tbh

1736 2018-12-12 20:39:09 Huh. I thought I was throwing down a welcome mat. Oh well. Good luck!
1737 2018-12-12 20:38:58 Can y'all believe the candle industry was invented as a capitalist ploy to get consumers to buy crude oil waste
1738 2018-12-12 20:38:56 It certainly is. North Sea oil just can’t be ignored. It’s been propping up your mind since the 70s.
1739 2018-12-12 20:38:54 I don't know why anyone is bothered particularly. Unionist media and political representatives lie and misrepresent as a default position. Can't you do a feature on how worthless the oil is or something? At least earn your king's shilling instead of copying graphs and tables.
1740 2018-12-12 20:38:54 Always thought Shelly Duvall was born to play Olive Oil
1741 2018-12-12 20:38:45 Pal oil Nigella palm oil
1742 2018-12-12 20:38:43 Really thinking about driving to Raleigh tomorrow for a oil change cause I seen that I can get one for $20 on Groupon 
1743 2018-12-12 20:38:28 That doesn’t even make any sense
1744 2018-12-12 20:38:22 @JamesGRickards In the past you haven't said much about Saudis getting US$ AND GOLD for their oil, and the US getting cheap oil in return and how this suits both parties. Can't this relationship predict that no substantial appreciation of gold price will be maintained?
1745 2018-12-12 20:38:17 Things High Achieving Millennials Don't Worry About:

1748 2018-12-12 20:37:35 Small yahoo boy, maybe he's collecting iTunes gift card
1749 2018-12-12 20:37:31 They aren’t, Ikora Cookies probably are, Cabal Oil + Orbs generated is easiest to get
1750 2018-12-12 20:36:50 $CL will be adding some OIL contracts over night as ASIA & EUROPE likes to push it higher
1751 2018-12-12 20:36:49 Adam's coworkers better fucking thank me for stopping him from using olive oil so his cookie dough wouldn't stick to the rolling pin and also to grease the cookie sheet
1752 2018-12-12 20:36:48 In electricity generation, yes!
In total primary energy, oil is and will continue to be #1.
Oil is almost too good to be true and cannot be easily replaced.
1753 2018-12-12 20:36:33 Why would we do that? It would be contrary to their narrative!! Clean, ethical oil and gas vs human rights violating, child slavery, and abusive, precious electric cars.
1754 2018-12-12 20:36:27 Now we see the desperation coming of Israel’s oil 
1755 2018-12-12 20:36:24 Does anyone have an essential oil to make stupid people shut up?

2- hair oil

1758 2018-12-12 20:36:07 Oh i want on this ! I'll bring the oil
1759 2018-12-12 20:35:39 My first husband is going to be a wealthy oil tycoon, my second husband is going to be a piece of shit Dominican man that’s going to enjoy my first husbands money wit me. Balance 
1760 2018-12-12 20:35:36 I’m at the Honda dealership waiting for an oil change and this 17 month old bb just hopped up into my lap. He was also highly interested in my water bottle and handed me a newspaper.
1761 2018-12-12 20:35:23 @RockstarGames I have to keep refilling my Dead Eye despite rarely using it online, including accidentally. That's starting to cost Snake Oil! #RDR2

1763 2018-12-12 20:35:19 I’m not the one in the imaginary world. 
From my side it’s you guys who bought into the snake oil salesman’s charms. 
Spending 25 Billion on solid cement wall is stupid. It’s a boondoggle. Trump is pushing it because he thinks it will get him votes - it won’t.
1764 2018-12-12 20:35:14 I think it’s the palm oil. They still smell of Christmas though. Perhaps they should do a candle instead.
1765 2018-12-12 20:35:10 On the other hand, claiming expertise on Middle Eastern matters irrelevant to the language and culture - per se- such as, I don't know, say The dynamics of Oil and Energy in the Middle East, is completely fine.
1766 2018-12-12 20:34:59 Is this sugar free, dairy free, oil free, depressing, nuts-and-oats-and-maybe-a-date-or-two granola bar still healthy if I dip it in a bunch of melted chocolate and peanut butter?

There’s no way to know. Science is a mystery. Nutrition facts are all lies.
1767 2018-12-12 20:34:58 The comments from Quebec, that there is no social acceptance for Albertas dirty oil, were the last straw. That in a nutshell is how much Canada wants Alberta at the table.
1768 2018-12-12 20:34:55 We’re allegedly the #1 Petro-State now. 

Even the disgusting, evil “but we need Saudis for their Oil!” Argument isn’t true anymore.
1769 2018-12-12 20:34:50 Putting more oil on rails hurts a lot of farmers trying to move grain. I have a better idea, we build a pipeline.
1770 2018-12-12 20:34:47 I use it as a moisturizer and body scrub made with sugar  I think for an eye make up remover just don’t soak the material your using to wipe away the make up. Oh and I cook with it. I buy the large jar of solid coconut oil at Costco
1771 2018-12-12 20:34:37 I have never smelled ginger essential oil before and just said fuck it & put it in the diffuser: INSTANTLY literally threw up
1772 2018-12-12 20:34:27 Having casual kept abreast due to the industry it seems there was no kyc or even independent audit to verify the snake oil. Greed gave way to glossy eyes and the cottage industry of insider knowledge took over.
1773 2018-12-12 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
1774 2018-12-12 20:34:06 Coconut oil ftw
1775 2018-12-12 20:33:59 @Channel4News @jonsnow Cappuccinos at 8.30 pm up North! Are you kidding me? One of my exes used to fill her hot water jar with rum! Small wonder she emptied my pollen sacs on a regular basis as I slumbered in our jojoba oil varnished hammock! Shame she emptied my bank account too
1776 2018-12-12 20:33:47 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
1777 2018-12-12 20:33:45 Some of you people's comment show the level of your exposure and ability to conceive a certain information, digest it&give it a critical&unbiased analysis. During the oil boom, ex President Yar'Adua made a pledge to ASUU but couldn't meet up now and ASUU doesn't want to adjust.
1778 2018-12-12 20:33:43 I wish I could take back all the views I gave @SHeartsSparkle 

animals can feel, non-Christians can make wonderful parents (I would know), and you should vaccinate your damn kids... it’s certainly more effective than some overpriced essential oil.
1779 2018-12-12 20:33:38 Massive gas and oil reserves and slave labour, for many of them
1780 2018-12-12 20:33:19 The UK supports Iran.  They want Irans oil money.  Much like they helped Hitler build his war machine prior to WWII.  HISTORY REPEATING.
1781 2018-12-12 20:33:13 they aint the snp i supported years ago , they have become torys in kilts . tax hikes for any1 that wants a good life yet the poor are still poor and well they cant see past dundee on the map unless its oil related . as for the eu they would sell us out just to kiss ass

1787 2018-12-12 20:32:57 The place I get my oil changed at is my favorite because it makes my life so easy. You stay in your car, they bring you a drink, and they clean your windows/mirrors and check your tire pressure.

1797 2018-12-12 20:31:38 You could reduce the need for oil and other resources a bit and reduce PVC impact on the environment by not selling or buying vinyl records. Please read all you can about polyvinyl-chloride and then decide whether or not to abandon vinyl records.
1798 2018-12-12 20:31:35 Are you really going to say that the oil wars beginning in the 90's and continuing to now are transitional violence? That the United States dictatorships in South America which overthrew leftist governments were transitional?
1799 2018-12-12 20:31:32 When the VP of a large TX oil company calls me for business law advice rather than asking Corporate Counsel, I take it as validation that my decades of legal study are well respected among that class.

1803 2018-12-12 20:31:09 AFAIK there has not been a new oil refinery in North America in forty years. Between the NIMBYs, the greens, the First Nations and the Canadian courts it would be impossible to build a new refinery in Canada even if private money wanted to try.

Jill Stein/Greens stood with us at SR while Dems/HRC took big oil money. And this conspiracy is mathematically inaccurate.
1810 2018-12-12 20:30:22 u think Hollywood celebrities r environmental clean? Think. They guzzle oil in their mansions, jets & SUV’s. Guzzle precious water in their huge pools & greening their huge yards. And their DVD’s r made in a dirty Chinese oil/coal fueled  factories.

1826 2018-12-12 20:28:20 Soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities in search of greater profits. The Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes. The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil. The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don't allow music.

1828 2018-12-12 20:27:59 “I will still obviously oppose any curtailing of oil and gas exploration, but that’s just because I don’t CARE about global warming, not because I don’t believe in it.”

1833 2018-12-12 20:27:17 Not true.  I followed Q for a long time.  But when it said that Syria and Iran would be destroyed, I knew it was fake.  This plan had been exposed many years before by General Wesley Clark.  There is no legitimate reason for Syria and Iran to be destroyed except to get their oil.
1834 2018-12-12 20:27:16 Drilling accidents are extremely rare and all over the world oil seeps out of the earth under the ocean naturally and it doesn’t kill everything off. If you want to tackle an issue work on cleaning trash out of the oceans.

1836 2018-12-12 20:26:56 No, #Trump did that. #oil #wti
1837 2018-12-12 20:26:52 Agree on all points. My question is this: how will the Trump administration respond? Their thinking was flood the market with oil, bring down prices and consumers will look for alternatives to Iranian oil. It hasn’t exactly worked out that way.

1841 2018-12-12 20:26:42 The snake oil salesman and his family will benefit from this. The poor, as usual, will either be further ground up and spit out or forced to move.
1842 2018-12-12 20:26:41 The Senators from Texas would tell you the OPEC deal did not run counter to our interests.  We are not the largest oil producer in the world at sub $50 WTI pricing no matter what Trump tweets...maybe Perry can help them to understand that.

1845 2018-12-12 20:26:18 I also remember certain right wingers saying, without a shadow of heart or understanding, "move to where the jobs are".

Oddly, those certain Albert right wingers (one now vying for Premiership) are not doing so today to oil workers.

“you checked the oil in that car”
1847 2018-12-12 20:26:05 My Omega-# researching has led me to high-oleic sunflower oil. HO means a better ratio of 3 to 6; we already get too much 6 in American diets, and it has a decently high smoke point—not as high as avocado oil, but not as expensive either.
1848 2018-12-12 20:26:05 Pot is filled with too much hot oil
Frozen chips are added, adding water to hot oil.
Water and hot oil react violently and bubble over the pot edge, hit fire and ignite.
1849 2018-12-12 20:26:03 @PremierScottMoe @jkenney maybe the western provinces should adopt a full surtax of 150 to 350% on all items we export to other provinces, or any oil based product and the oil we do have. Maybe the rest of the country would wake up. 
I do believe this is with the charter.

1855 2018-12-12 20:25:22 So if we eat less meat, there will also be less cows. Is that the logic? Couldn’t the reverse be true?  Is the ‘elephant in the room’ human produced methane then? Lastly, do energy absorbing crystals or the wearing of reflective tin foil hats assist in reducing global temp?

1857 2018-12-12 20:24:28 Uh! Do your math again. Your own numbers show they are a net exporter. Plus the 10's of millions of $$ they make EVERY day by  buying (WCS) our discounted oil and selling (export) their own at WTI prices.
1858 2018-12-12 20:24:26 I was 5 & wanted to cook for my mom when she got back from work that afternoon.

I decided to fry chicken while she napped... using corn oil.

It ignited, I freaked out & threw the pan out the window, ended up setting my back yard on fire.

Tried to put it out using a broom...

1866 2018-12-12 20:23:31 What do you currenttuse to keep the oil away? Any specific reason ‘why’ you don’t like setting powder? Is it too drying? What about trying a blur stick that combats oily skin, and then using a setting spray? (The milk blur stick is great for it)
1867 2018-12-12 20:23:18 Majority of unemployment hit the oil&gas where workers are contractors and EI doesn't apply for them. JT know this and increasing EI won't help much.

No need to fund busses & buildings when the majority of education can happen at home. No more school shootings or bullying and lower property taxes or not!
1872 2018-12-12 20:22:21 my bath consists of muscle soak powder, stress relief radox, calming bubble bath and far too many drops of lavender oil in to count. Yup my body has been crying out for this since last Sunday

1878 2018-12-12 20:22:05 Yes, it does matter. Depending how the carbon pricing is implemented, consumers will see a double benefit, the first is by reducing their consumption of oil products, the second is from the rebate. Better to use the rebate to insulate a house than pay more than is needed for gas.
1879 2018-12-12 20:21:55 Donald it was their money, it was from the sale of their oil

1886 2018-12-12 20:20:39 last night i found that one of my friends did not know that Petrol  prices were because Modi had to repay thousands of cores oil debt UPA  took from Iran, or that Modi has started creating safety oil reserves  for three weeks  of which two weeks have already been completed.

1912 2018-12-12 20:17:46 The secret is using hot oil
1913 2018-12-12 20:17:41 can a girl with a septum piercing and that milk and honey poetry book please tell me what essential oil will cure my depression
1914 2018-12-12 20:17:32 I've had a proper long steamy bath in the hope it's just congestion, really don't have time to go to the g.p with an infection. Might put garlic oil in my ear 
1915 2018-12-12 20:17:31 Can we please STOP USING PALM OIL. We have so many fucking alternatives at our hands and we still choose to use a product that is responsible for 40% of our agricultural deforestation!!!!!!!!
1916 2018-12-12 20:17:31 Perhaps, remember oil accounts for around 35% of Iran’s GDP. As long as Iran exports around a 1 million barrels they can manage, barely but they can manage.
1917 2018-12-12 20:17:21 Try Wheat Germ oil,it will clear off inna week
1918 2018-12-12 20:17:16 ive been using rosehip seed oil on my face for almost a month & all it has done is make my face look greasy..... idk why i took advice from aromatherapy & crystals twitter smh
1919 2018-12-12 20:17:14 False.  Not all Alberta oil is oil sands oil.  Definitely not as cheap as Saudi oil but I guess you support human rights violations over paying slightly more for oil. Not all U. S. Oil is cheap to get our clean.
1920 2018-12-12 20:17:11 to rent 1 of them would wipe out half my monthly wage , to buy well i got knocked back on a 50k  mortgage cause i dont earn enough . not a chance i could affored so called affordable house . snag being aberdeen based every1 thinks we work in the oil ,bit o news we dont  @snp
1921 2018-12-12 20:17:10 Crude oil prices remained steady today after the Energy Information Administration confirmed an API estimate of a crude oil inventory draw but a much smaller one than API’s 10.18 million barrels.#crudeoilprices
1922 2018-12-12 20:17:00 Another flaw in this argument:  we still have oil and gas but quickly losing prosperity.  Why?  Bad policies, interventionist government and obstruction.  Good business environment and dedicated, entrepreneurial culture made Alberta successful.
1923 2018-12-12 20:16:51 It blows my mind to see what Alberta considers to be a hard time, anything less than a boom and people start disintegrating. Maybe if people in the oil industry actually listened when we kept saying the boom wouldn't last, go to school and have a backup plan... But noooooo
1924 2018-12-12 20:16:47 LAMUKA don't look for what you can't end up koz you have put the oil into the fire and i think you wanna see the reaction don't worry we gonna give the answer
We know you're playin the game for transition si that your shitfuckers JB and mk  come in Congo but you are dreaming
1925 2018-12-12 20:16:38 We do - Unicorn tears are a bit expensive for most budgets, but we do have lapis lazuli oil paint from Michael Harding #artychat
1926 2018-12-12 20:16:34 . "best oil in the world" seems a rather odd claim for diluted bitumen .

1929 2018-12-12 20:16:15 Hello I’m Ali and I go to get my oil changed and find out that my taillight is out. So dude says “oh we can change that for you.” So I said dope I appreciate that. Guess who hasn’t taken their manikin head out of their trunk  #adayinthelifeofali
1930 2018-12-12 20:16:10 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1931 2018-12-12 20:16:07 California should take some of the fight out of oil companies by revoking all licenses to one of them.
1932 2018-12-12 20:16:06 One idiot tweeting on behalf of another
1933 2018-12-12 20:16:03 Watched an episode of #saltfatacidheat, now me and Hannah are out looking for really good olive oil for cooking lol
1934 2018-12-12 20:16:02 Hate NEVER travels well. I could not agree with you more, Mike. It's a heavy load to carry and never worth it.

1937 2018-12-12 20:15:36 Mix 50/50 Dettol and baby oil. Apply to your body. No more mozzies.
1938 2018-12-12 20:15:35 I dreadfully remember those days when I had to literally burn midnight oil to study 15 year back. Roads were even more pathetic. Thankfully generation after me got mama @ChouhanShivraj who pulled MP out of BIMARU category. Love you mamaji
1939 2018-12-12 20:15:27 Hi, @planttherapy! I couldn't find Honeybell synergy on your shelf life chart. What's the shelf life for this oil?
1940 2018-12-12 20:15:15 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
1941 2018-12-12 20:15:13 If Olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?
1942 2018-12-12 20:15:12 Hey, hey! I'm totally blue, just live in a red state that is changing. You will love Texas, Adam. It has a lot of great red and blue people.
1943 2018-12-12 20:14:50 yeah coconut oil
1944 2018-12-12 20:14:43 Where do they even need to transfer the oil?
1945 2018-12-12 20:14:43 Me, trying to figure out why they don't use RED OIL as Anointing OIL.


1946 2018-12-12 20:14:39 can we discuss how travis liked this tweet acting like he doesnt use homemade hairline oil to attempt to fix his atrocity of a hairline
1947 2018-12-12 20:14:30 Obviously Jordan Peterson just wants a mature and intelligence discussion and doesn't receive money from oil companies and such.
1948 2018-12-12 20:14:24 Needa oil my dry ass scalp

1950 2018-12-12 20:14:11 90 cent dividend combined with the drop in oil price nearly took $CVRR out, I bet they will lower div in February, I regret buying in at $20! #HouseAlwaysWins #BTC #CNBC #XRP #Stocks #Refinery $COP $BP $BPT $HFC
1951 2018-12-12 20:14:11 My girl SOPHIE dropped a banger of an album this year so I have to go with SOPHIE -  OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S U -INDIES.
1952 2018-12-12 20:14:06 Giving her more meds to continue to get the worms and parasites out of her. Her fur is slowly coming back as her skin is healing (yea vitamin E oil). <post 2>
1953 2018-12-12 20:13:55 =57 year old massive oil tank buried in backyard, what could go wrong?
1954 2018-12-12 20:13:54 If the scars are texture then some vitamin E oil and if it’s hyperpigmentation then some spot treatment from like Sephora or Kiehls should be fine
1955 2018-12-12 20:13:53 I'm gonna side with Rob, mostly, here, in saying that as much as stuff isn't 77's fault, the black cloud over his head remains
1956 2018-12-12 20:13:53 Good luck. You sound bitter, and I hope things work out better for you there. But I have my doubts. Hate doesn't travel well.

Just Say NO Liz 
1961 2018-12-12 20:13:33 I'll be in soon for my oil change.
1962 2018-12-12 20:13:26 Coconut oil is a moisturizer so it have my skin  super soft without being overly oily and it’s also supposed to be like a detox because I add epsom salt and a few drops of tea tree oil and soak for like 30 minutes and then take a warm shower. It always helps me!
1963 2018-12-12 20:13:21 Trump is a jerk for sure.  He doesn’t want the electric cars to do well.  Trump’s buddies have too much invested in the oil industry.  Trump’s is not willing to look to the future - he clearly is only looking out for himself, again!
1964 2018-12-12 20:13:10 As an owner of several cats, my hat is off to you!  Good luck!  My experience in the past is that sedation only made them more disoriented, but maybe CBD oil? I would ask the vet. GOOD LUCK!
1965 2018-12-12 20:13:04 Cheap oil for sale. Just call Rachel Notley. Transport might be a bit of a problem though.
1966 2018-12-12 20:13:00 More than 180 Valvoline Instant Oil Change shops sold AutoTex Pink windshield wipers in October to raise awareness of breast cancer. Finishing its seventh year, the campaign has raised over $100,000 for the National Breast Cancer Foundation.  @Valvoline
1967 2018-12-12 20:12:58 I can only understand the modern business man as something like a snake oil vendor. Selling salt crystals as diamonds and multi level marketing schemes as a livelihood.
1968 2018-12-12 20:12:53 Plus palm oil
1969 2018-12-12 20:12:48 Then they should try straight CBD oil, cuz that’s what helps w pain and discomfort and just about everything
1970 2018-12-12 20:12:42 The need to support such a vast number of us is killing the natural world, clearing forests for palm oil etc. If we dropped to 3-4 billion, around the level before our recent exponential growth worldwide, we & our next generations, and the environment, would be much better off.
1971 2018-12-12 20:12:21 自分、CバナナDです
1972 2018-12-12 20:12:21 Ever since I stopped vaping weed oil I’m so fucking hungry all day every day. Just an observation.
1973 2018-12-12 20:12:18 And made Dennis Thatcher a large profit from the share prices of the company that he owned, that had leases on the foreshore rights in the Falkland Islands.

All of the speculation about the East Falkland oil fields.
1974 2018-12-12 20:12:17 Well if we wait for 50 years for the oil to run out perhaps.
1975 2018-12-12 20:12:10 I'll never understand it myself. These snake oil salesmen appear as saviors to people who aren't able to critically think about how it's all connected.
1976 2018-12-12 20:12:10 Lovely! I like a simple garlic cream soup or a horseradish cream, none of these would probably lend themselves well to hot oil, though. But the spanish recipe certainly does.
1977 2018-12-12 20:12:06 Where dat oil at?
1978 2018-12-12 20:12:06 .
In fairness.....Venezuala is state socialist (different ideology) ... and Venezuala relied its economy on oil .... oil prices crashed in 2009 and led to the problems there ... compounded by the government becoming basically a dictatorship
1979 2018-12-12 20:12:03 remember when Rachel was all "screw you guys you're going to pay more for polluting the planet" only to go "whatever you guys say, we'll buy some rail cars" #deepstateOIL  37 mil in royalties from 3.4 bil in oil taken. we get more from the liquor barns
1980 2018-12-12 20:11:54 @RonanWeber109 just left. who da fuck is gonna oil me up now?
1981 2018-12-12 20:11:50 I had a pencil !
OMG It MUST have been a Russian pencil !!!!
(Do the Russians actually make any pencils ? or anything except weapons and oil ?)
1982 2018-12-12 20:11:50 I am baffled by someone who thinks that importing oil from countries with non existent environmental standards and human rights violations is better than buying oil from their own country. And then when the west calls this out they are labeled whiners?
1983 2018-12-12 20:11:46 Next week on The Gatewatch and Friends, Santa has found some strange black oil. He might be bringing more then presents to all the boys and girls of the multiverse this year.
1984 2018-12-12 20:11:46 LOL 

Me and my shaggy surfer hair self just wore leggings and a hoodie into an oil field gas station and I'm dying at all the confused looks I got.
1985 2018-12-12 20:11:31 Olive oil  only to take down a twist out or something ... not heavy enough to moisturize my hair is what I’ve learned
1986 2018-12-12 20:11:22 We need to oil
1987 2018-12-12 20:11:06 Buy some black seed oil bruh for that flu
1988 2018-12-12 20:11:03 Most renewables require fossil fuels to produce, transport and install. Oil is more than fuel. It’s in everything.
1989 2018-12-12 20:10:52 fucked around and put coconut oil in my hair. now I smell like an almond joy
1990 2018-12-12 20:10:52 They stopped giving me all the oil changes at work and started moving me up to the good shit lmao sick
1991 2018-12-12 20:10:49 Not a prayer.  Mogg is not "follow me boys" he's an "off you go lads" sort of snake oil salesman.

1996 2018-12-12 20:10:02 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
1997 2018-12-12 20:10:00 Indoor conednser coils can get covererd with oil and dust which makes heat transfer difficult. This can raise cond temps 15F deg or more. If a space hits 90F, then you could see 125F condensing. #DanfossHVACR
1998 2018-12-12 20:09:56 dunno from where exactly in spain - happened upon the recipe years ago and fell in love. yeah i made my szechuan oil with tons of birds eye chilis (because available), szechuan pepper, whole cumin, black sesame and... some spanish smoked paprika because it was just too good...
1999 2018-12-12 20:09:52 Been snorting peppermint oil all day. #goawaysinuspressure
2000 2018-12-12 20:09:47 Adam Kokesh debated Sam Seder on @majorityfm and he said this
about oil companies- 

"They don't wanna drill and spill oil and fracking water all over my lettuce. You know, like people don't wanna do that, let's have a better mechanism of accountability."
2001 2018-12-12 20:09:42 Smoking is good for you! Burning natural gas to process oil sands that’s going to be burned is good for the planet! The atmosphere is a infinte sewage. Gases desappear leaving no trace.
2002 2018-12-12 20:09:35 My boyfriend... AFTER I TAUGHT HIM (except changing oil. My dad does that )
2003 2018-12-12 20:09:34 That isn't a surprise. His puppeteer, Butts, ran WWF which was partially funded by Tides and other groups. Im sure they totally agree with the foreign funded groups that oppose Alberta oil. Time to cut our losses in Alberta and leave the country that doesn't want us around.
2004 2018-12-12 20:09:33 Considering the fact it’s also dumb to try allying ourselves completely after Khashoggi was killed by the Saudi Prince. We’ve given the Middle East more money for Oil then anything else. Want to hurt them? Cut off that artery to them we have.

Disappointing @AsdaServiceTeam
2009 2018-12-12 20:09:06 Sort of. Zits are caused by a bacterial infection which is caused by some kind of build up on the skin by dirt or oil. If not cleaned off, this can cause an infection in the form of a zit. Volcanoes are the result of techtonic plates rubbing together which cause lava to bubble-
2010 2018-12-12 20:09:03 they take forever and a day for a oil change alone
2011 2018-12-12 20:08:57 Tough one. Probably the time I had an older lady and her like son come in saying I needed to warranty calipers cuz they were sticking. They were sticking cuz the pads were missing and the rotors were orange with rust. Or any time a customer blows an engine due to no oil changes
2012 2018-12-12 20:08:54 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 10 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

2013 2018-12-12 20:08:51 You ever get that oil change
2014 2018-12-12 20:08:51 You know uski aaukat to hai nahi meri ga** me hath Dale, lekin na ek chiz hai I will eat lots of aloo in the morning and will also drink oil fir jab bathroom jaakr French fries aayega na that you can eat, jaise tum Congress ka khate ho
2015 2018-12-12 20:08:47 I suppose giving @CBCNews @Bombardier & GM subsidies, Bailouts & debt forgiveness of more than 5 billion means all these will be sustainable & create thousands of jobs & not at all counterproductive? They bought a pipeline so they could control oil. They nationalized oil! Stupid!
2016 2018-12-12 20:08:46 You're just envious of our Italian coconut oil from Pioppi.
2017 2018-12-12 20:08:36 overall i’m pretty satisfied with the crusading memes. they are about equal to the oil memes and moth memes.
2018 2018-12-12 20:08:24 The auto oil dealing cartel it is!
2019 2018-12-12 20:08:21 I'm not sure a broken hand can be added to the constantly injured dialogue. Blocking shots can take your healthiest guy out of the lineup with a 90 m/h slapper
2020 2018-12-12 20:07:42 Perhaps Congress would use Bonds alike done in case of pumping bond-money to keep oil price lower, and as usual policy of Congress in case of doles, to skim out a percentage from beneficiaries, and collection of commissions  to some follower goons.  #ModiVsMahagathbandhan

2024 2018-12-12 20:06:50 BTW, read my tweets if you actually want to unplug the cartel/deep state/CIA and other corrupt people.  OIL and energy is the foundation of the power.  Solve energy and give it to all, the control is gone.  READ MY TWEETS.  Key to solving government is solving energy.
2025 2018-12-12 20:06:22 I'm not sure it's that easy - I asked my GP about CBD oil today & she wouldn't prescribe me any refuting the idea it will help me.  
Our GPs need educating, based on clinical trial results. I'm not sure how far down the line we are in the UK with trials on chronic pain patients
2026 2018-12-12 20:06:16 the right change huh?with one oil field it grew at 3.6 under mahama.shouldnt it suppose to grow at 10.6 with 3 oil fields under nana?
2027 2018-12-12 20:06:15 LRT Nice motor oil you poured there
2028 2018-12-12 20:06:14 I only know if you let fall a small object with the same moment of inertia of a sumarine inside a glass of kitchen or food oil with no implosion at all ...that gets the bottom without any rotation at all and keeping its azimuth!!!
2029 2018-12-12 20:06:06 @colbertlateshow  Putin/ Trump comment.   She will issue heartfelt apology, maybe a sniffle or a tear if she can generate one. All will be forgiven, Trump bashing will move forward again. Sad these ppl considered the " smart ones," entrusted to inform us.
2030 2018-12-12 20:06:02 Police say a concrete truck and oil tanker crashed. The tanker cracked near the top limiting the amount of oil spilled. Buildings surrounding the intersection have been evacuated. Concern now is the fumes. The intersection will be closed for several hours while cleanup continues
2031 2018-12-12 20:05:56 For Gods Sake. Leave these 2 alone. The Sun loves putting oil on the fire. That's how they spread Bad News. They plant the seed and flood it with "Grow More" STOP IT
2032 2018-12-12 20:05:53 “QE" hugely increased the availability of credit to the energy sector. allowing oil companies to borrow from banks at extremely low interest rates, with the worth of syndicated loans to the oil and gas sectors rising from $600 billion in 2006 to $1.6 trillion in 2014.” Pay?
2033 2018-12-12 20:05:51 Hey what you tweeting on? You shouldn’t even be on here. Oil based product your using. Again I reiterate hypocrisy.  You probably have clothes on also!
2034 2018-12-12 20:05:40 lower oil prices?
2035 2018-12-12 20:05:26 started using coconut oil as lotion and has been the best decision since
2036 2018-12-12 20:05:19 Nigel Farage being pushed on what is plan was for leaving the EU. “Brexit means Brexit” was his response. That clears that up then. Seriously what an utter cockend. He can’t even muster up a couple of sentences that justifies his 25 year campaign to Leave. Snake oil salesmen.
2037 2018-12-12 20:05:14 We get more of our oil from Canada than from Saudi Arabia.  Its not one or the other, oil from Saudi Arabia doesn't mean tolerating such blatant acts of horror. We can stand strong and say we expect you Not to brutally murder Journalists who come to apply for a marriage license
2038 2018-12-12 20:04:53 @Asad_Umar Government should act fast. All the members of the different boards in oil, gas and energy sector are compromised. If we have to save our National interest all the members of different boards including chairmen should be reappointed.Mafias can’t survive without cronies
2039 2018-12-12 20:04:51 Not in my experience weed always calms my stomach, you can always use cbd oil for an alternative if you think smoking would make you throw up like it’s straight medicine hun
2040 2018-12-12 20:04:50 Thanks Jim, Im very wary of some of these guys as Im sure u know there r a lot of shady characters involved in juniors. Its 1 thing 2 fail due to oil crash it's another thing that they failed to disclose receivership to shareholders. That’s a red flag for me. Best of luck.
2041 2018-12-12 20:04:48 Unfortunately, Canada cannot produce oil cheaper than countries like Saudi Arabia and the United States.
2042 2018-12-12 20:04:43 A bih just spent 99 on an oil change 
2043 2018-12-12 20:04:43 So you are in favour of losing billions of dollars going to research and achieving different technologies. Dirty Oil give me a break! You have no clue how these other forms of power are generated. What does a plant do? What is needed for this to happen. CO2+H20 C6H12O6+O2 
2044 2018-12-12 20:04:43 Almost everybody rejects your  particular brand of snake oil Jacob. Be quiet now, and stop your mewling....
2045 2018-12-12 20:04:42 America and oil in 1 sentence.
2046 2018-12-12 20:04:41 Adam, please stop. All you're doing now is showing your ignorance. Remember, Republicans in California are a dying breed. And comments like yours won't help them come back. I abandoned the Republican Party when nutjobs like you took over control. It's NOT the party of Lincoln.
2047 2018-12-12 20:04:27 The feds could stop that in a heartbeat with tariffs on foreign oil or insisting that imported oil meet the same environmental and labor standards that CDN oil is subject to. If they did then Saudi Arabia could no longer count on using CDN money to fund their atrocities

2049 2018-12-12 20:04:24 We’re interested to hear directly from the artist about how art suppliers can best serve them! I’m Sarah (Marketing) & I’m here with @Subtlecolour Chris who is an oil painter with an amazing knowledge of art materials! #artychat
2050 2018-12-12 20:04:07 Very good observation! And China is a global leader today in investment into renewable energy! So-called #Ugandan oil is....anybody's guess, but fact is, it won't benefit the average #Ugandan. Glass hàlf-full comment on my part!?! I'll live by it!
2051 2018-12-12 20:04:02 I hope work has gone well...all that time off. You have done well. 
Twist in the tail here...Qwerty followed me on twitter and we have had some little chats.
2052 2018-12-12 20:03:52 It smells like tires and oil.
2053 2018-12-12 20:03:47 It's only socially acceptable to use Saudi oil, ruled by a kingdom that murders journalists and chops them up. Way to go Quebec
2054 2018-12-12 20:03:42 Quebecers are most heavily taxed in NA for gas: 10 cents fed excise tax, 19 cents Qc fuel tax & 3 cents Mtl tax for public transport then 5% GST & 9.975% PST added. Look in a mirror for the cause of inequities - Cons chose in 2009 equalization formula to add 50% oil&gas revenue.
2055 2018-12-12 20:03:36 I don’t need my oil changed but I need a new starter:/
2056 2018-12-12 20:03:31 This gif is so entertaining but I am so confused as to how you'd start a fire with fries in oil... Hehe
2057 2018-12-12 20:03:28 In fact coming home listened Tom Hartmann tuned in on a question being asked once the REPUBLICANS are out of office  will we be able to GET OUR PUBLIC LANDS BACK that the  TRUMP Syndicate gave to the Oil and Gas Cartels .buddies.......The PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW
2058 2018-12-12 20:03:23 @xoShaaan what’s face oil do you recommend the most? Are the Body Shop ones any good?
2059 2018-12-12 20:03:12 What Trump was really saying (and still is) at his election rallies was "I'll tell you whatever you want to hear even though none of it is true because you are dumb enough to believe it without question." The true skills of a snake oil salesman and his gullible customers.
2060 2018-12-12 20:03:03 Hi #artychat I'm Chris and I work @PegasusArtShop advising on art materials. I'm an oil painter, but I know about a lot of different products, brands and techniques.
2061 2018-12-12 20:02:59 I need still think oil heads to 45-47
2062 2018-12-12 20:02:58 Just as long as you spread them liberally with the finest oil, they can be whatever color they like! LOL!
2063 2018-12-12 20:02:53 Our oil, as you call it, isn’t worth a fraction of what the SNP budgeted for before the Indy vote, thank god you guys lost, or the country would have been bankrupt within a year!
2064 2018-12-12 20:02:52 What a waste of potential weed oil
2065 2018-12-12 20:02:47 I'm investing in oil resorts.
2066 2018-12-12 20:02:44 Quand la finance lâchera le Oil & Gas, c’est à dire autour de 2025 d’après les experts !

that is very strange

2075 2018-12-12 20:01:47 It's not an oil slump, it's a pipeline slump. WTIC is trading above $50, and globally, crude trades above $60. And even if it was trading at $150, it still wouldn't do us any good if we can't get our product to market. Because other provinces and the Feds stabbed us in the back.

2078 2018-12-12 20:01:38 He just thinks he's hawking snake oil to the gawping masses.
2079 2018-12-12 20:01:31 So since oil has started been excavated in Burma is it safe to say that US will come as rescuer of Rohingya people? Seeing as there are already elements of extremist groups from Saudi and Pakistan mixing with Rohingya resistance? #Rohingyas

2082 2018-12-12 20:01:30 I propose raising the voting age to 35, seriously.
2083 2018-12-12 20:01:26 Heck, might not be a bad thing to make the voting age 35 too.
2084 2018-12-12 20:01:19 Coconut oil....everywheres
2085 2018-12-12 20:01:18 Well by #CONbeliefs oil-zealots will be magically showed with $150bbl oil by the oil gods as well as make man made climate change disappear, scientists will cease alternative energy research, and...oh and everyone will be white.
2086 2018-12-12 20:01:18 But this castor oil ima drink can 
2087 2018-12-12 20:01:11 Trump wouldn’t take any action against these wahabi nutters. Trump cares more about USA arms deals and oil exports with Saudis then this barbarically murdered innocent journalist. USA regime doesn’t stand up for what is right. They only stand for what is in their interests. Fact
2088 2018-12-12 20:01:07 My definition of real and yo definition of real are totally different that's why we don't click, oil and water don't mix.
2089 2018-12-12 20:01:03 What’s going on in Venezuela? Are they still producing oil?
2090 2018-12-12 20:01:01 So when the cake box say add oil, what kind of oil y’all use cuz I always use butter or margarine
2091 2018-12-12 20:00:46 What is that? An oil spill? A chemical leak? What is in that water??? 
2092 2018-12-12 20:00:40 Nonsense, the oil industry doesn’t get any subsidies not available to any other sector.
2093 2018-12-12 20:00:28 Idk it kinda kills me when people take pictures and make sure to sneak in their foreign car logos. Like fam idgaf I’m just happy I have a car, yall don’t even know how to take care of your car  fucking $200 oil changes my ass.

2096 2018-12-12 20:00:17 How much is palm oil?
2097 2018-12-12 20:00:15 My hair is completely dry in my avi. Just washed and left the house. A little bit of oil
2098 2018-12-12 20:00:10 "At 240 metres long, the monstrous mound of grease, oil, wet wipes and nappies stretches the length of Tower Bridge and weighs 130 tons - the equivalent of 11 double-decker buses, a blue whale, or 520,000 packets of lard." That's from the Daily Express, though.
2099 2018-12-12 20:00:04 Big oil needs to be destroyed. @ExtinctionR  Extinction Rebellion
2100 2018-12-12 20:00:03 Enough people don’t know about that seaberry oil and I’m here to tell u.....that it’s mad fire
2101 2018-12-12 19:59:58 “Because some cardiologists pointed out that it was a big caveat?“  The ones involved in a “competing” study?  Or the ones that falsely blamed mineral oil placebo?  There’s no need to read between the lines
2102 2018-12-12 19:59:50 Day 8 on LC IF (mostly meat). Surprisingly easy to shake off the trashy Xmas lunch from yesterday. A bit hungrier than usual but that'll be the carbs. Wife overcooked the beef so had to soak it in olive oil to get it down. Might have overdone that. Feeling a bit queasy now.
2103 2018-12-12 19:59:49 Hostile?  You buy oil from Canada at like 12$ a barrel.  You guys are pretty much stealing it.
2104 2018-12-12 19:59:48 Thanks for the update, Ms. May. But i have a comment about those loopholes you speak about for the Canadian oil producers. i understand why you think they should be paying more for their emissions, but having spent some time in the corporate world,  I can also see their side....
2105 2018-12-12 19:59:46 Yesss. Good. Though coconut oil might cause dryness on the scalp in winters.
2106 2018-12-12 19:59:41 Awww...thanks!
2107 2018-12-12 19:59:38 Naples Beach Brewery (@NaplesBeachBrew): Naples Beach 239 Ale  (@naplesbeachbrew)  is on, replacing Naples Beach QBE Swing Oil (@naplesbeachbrew)
2108 2018-12-12 19:59:31 5 House Dems voted against the Farm Bill rule & scuttled a vote on the Yemen resolution. 3 are easily explainable: 

Peterson - VERY red House district. 
Ruppersburger - Defense $$
Costa - Oil/Gas $$

But Scott and Lawson are mysteries.  Why'd they vote with the GOP? Ideas?
2109 2018-12-12 19:59:26 Tell us about the Carbon Tax exempt oil coming from Saudi Geraldo, interested to hear you would exempt them. This, when all the while telling ordinary Canadians they must pay for the good of the environment is why Canadians see you as a Con and Hypocrite.
2110 2018-12-12 19:59:18 Thank you!!
2111 2018-12-12 19:59:15 I think the sexiest thing about this situation is how my oil indicator keeps going off at random intervals which is really just the soundtrack to my descent into madness
2112 2018-12-12 19:59:14 Bahaha. Go ahead. Do it.
2113 2018-12-12 19:59:13 Bingo!!
2114 2018-12-12 19:59:11 Agreed.  Make non-combustible products with oil.  Value added jobs instead of shipping it raw around the world to burn.  That way we make our #ParisAgreement commitments, and create jobs here.
2115 2018-12-12 19:59:09 i woke up,looked in the mirror and oh how I was glowing. "me too I'm glowing".
then i realised it's oil. I just have an oily face
2116 2018-12-12 19:59:08 White paper was built on fantasy. Pound was on-starter, policies were uncosted (especially as IndyScot couldn't maintain 7% deficit) and reliant on oil staying stable (it didn't).  New white paper says indyScot would need to cutback. Russ would lampoon this were it leave.
2117 2018-12-12 19:59:08 Anyone got the cure to an ear that pops and gurgles when you blow your nose, cries out in pain when you swallow etc? No doctor suggestions please, can't get an appointment till 21st and the walk in here is a thousand minutes wait. Does olive oil really work? Asking for a friend
2118 2018-12-12 19:59:00 I'm still recovering from "oil resort."
2119 2018-12-12 19:58:58 You're silly.
2120 2018-12-12 19:58:58 Finally got a prescription I needed and when I went to go pick it up realized that it’s made with peanut oil. I have a severe peanut allergy. :-)
2121 2018-12-12 19:58:50 Me, sick and tired of being pregnant, trying to include labor:

*chugs a gallon of raspberry leaf tea*

*eats a pound each of dates and pineapple*

*swallows a cup of castor oil*

*shoves an entire bottle’s worth of evening primrose oil up my vagina* 

*does 1000 squats*
2122 2018-12-12 19:58:47 My boss just ROASTED me for wanting to buy $54 jojoba oil in a hand blown glass jar and I’m basically on the floor cackling. He called me a fucking QVC salesman
2123 2018-12-12 19:58:47 I just rubbed oil all over @DemolitionRanch 

I thought it was for a skit but apparently he wasn’t filming. So now I’m seriously considering what just went on
2124 2018-12-12 19:58:45 Very oily floor for oil
2125 2018-12-12 19:58:42 Ello sir I'm from elf n safety is the oil in your hair fire retardent ?
2126 2018-12-12 19:58:42 No. I'm good. But thanks!
2127 2018-12-12 19:58:41 I made some szechuan Chili oil recently and thought about adding it but i wanna make sopa de ajo with it and that just wouldnt mix
2128 2018-12-12 19:58:30 ‘Pours coconut oil over entire life’
2129 2018-12-12 19:58:23 I think i want to prepp a canvas so that i can maybe start on a oil portrait
2130 2018-12-12 19:58:15 . . . did you drop an oil can all over your apartment or something?
2131 2018-12-12 19:58:13 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2132 2018-12-12 19:58:11 Without oil, you wouldn't be able to share your thought on environmental issues over social media. No renewable source of energy or product can provide that. At then end of the day, ask yourself what you are willing to sacrifice and live without to reduce dependance on oil.
2133 2018-12-12 19:58:09 I’m getting an oil change and on the waiting room tv is playing a show called “Caught in a Providence” about a Rhode Island courtroom. All these ghouls with “pah-king tickets” are making me ill
2134 2018-12-12 19:58:05 I swear black families don’t have patience to teach you anything. Not spades, cook, how change oil, balance a check book, credit. Nothing
2135 2018-12-12 19:58:00 @Derek_Hanekom I hear you had to admit that SA wasn't meeting our goals at Cop24.  Well... it has never been your intention has it? Giving Rhino Oil & Gas the go ahead. Supporting big bu$ine$$ over people & planet.. you've shown your true colours.  You support mass extinction.
2136 2018-12-12 19:57:58 No chance. Have a fabulous day!!
2137 2018-12-12 19:57:55 This is My Favorite Store  Hey Tj I’ve got a Naughty Cowgirl Shop that would look good by your Pound Shop ...Hustle till ur Haters ask you for a Job is my motto...I’m gonna sale motor oil and Poles that Hook on to Trucks  Boom  Pop Pow 
2138 2018-12-12 19:57:49 Thank God oo, you're one of those few.
2139 2018-12-12 19:57:47 The approach of US government might be so mild due to:
1. Oil,
2. Saudis own US debt bonds in nominal value of about 170 billions $.
Would you be able to imagine what would happen if they decided to either sell it or redemption it???
2140 2018-12-12 19:57:45 facewash is used to remove dirt from your skin which has accumulated through oils, winters main oil itna produce hi nhi hota so using facewash several times a day will dry out your skin. You can use water alone nd pat your skin dry, don't rub it.   Afaaka hoga inshAllah :p
2141 2018-12-12 19:57:42 Genuine question: How does 200m-400m/year reserve compare to new national airline? ensuring oil production will almost certainly generate direct tax revenue, grow economy, earn profits for national oil company. seems like a decent investment @Opiaiya
2142 2018-12-12 19:57:42 essential oils are the goat.
can’t sleep?-sandalwood oil
anxious?-lavender oil 
congested?-eucalyptus oil 
nauseous?-peppermint oil

2144 2018-12-12 19:57:15 I guess oil is going bancrupt again
2145 2018-12-12 19:57:08 I still remember the very first Que party during bridge. I drunk soo much oil to the point I caught alcohol poisoning and got the flu. That was thee moment.

2154 2018-12-12 19:56:11 Remove oil money and see if socialism works. It only works in rich nations with low population
2155 2018-12-12 19:56:09 are you sure you want that? it's pretty messy—literally, considering there is motor oil covering most of my possessions.
2156 2018-12-12 19:56:07 
2157 2018-12-12 19:56:01 So does it mean even though Ngcolosi's kids been employed they do not have personal savings and been dependant on Maluju Oil credit cards #imbewutheseed
2158 2018-12-12 19:55:51 The eco Argon oil is my SHIT. PERIODT.
2159 2018-12-12 19:55:35 Oil investors concerned about supplies due to surging U.S. output & uncertainty over how OPEC & its allies will implement production cuts have reason to worry about demand as well.
2160 2018-12-12 19:55:34 Dumping oil into a different market will help you realize current price instead of a huge discount.  Big difference. Could also send oil east and support our country instead of middle East.
2161 2018-12-12 19:55:31 Doo Gro mega thick growth oil
2162 2018-12-12 19:55:28 It is time we joined the USA then.  Our own country east and west, seem to hate our money and our oil.
2163 2018-12-12 19:55:27 I know that's why I said 'that makes the girls he's marrying consent'
2164 2018-12-12 19:55:19 some1 used up all my skinny boy extra virgin olive oil and replaced it with canola.... when judgement day comes around, then you will realize.

2168 2018-12-12 19:54:58 bought 100% tree oil for my piercings and i was not prepared for the smell... holy fuck
2169 2018-12-12 19:54:42 Dude you wouldn't even be able to tell me anything about Venezuela or Cuba  the illegal US embargo or siege on Cuba? 

The US coup in Venezuela and the oil crash? Don't just use right wing talking points
2170 2018-12-12 19:54:42 No thanks. I stick with facts.
2171 2018-12-12 19:54:38 Long day of work & now I’m stuck getting my oil change  I just wanna nap
2172 2018-12-12 19:54:28 fryin is unhealthier u usse more oil and stuf fand grilled is actuall good its protein and that u ge more fatwhen its fried
2173 2018-12-12 19:54:21 Heading to get my oil changed. Here's to hoping it isn't crowded so I can get in and out of there.
2174 2018-12-12 19:54:19 Peppermint oil isn't working on my headaches so I figured I would ingest some peppermint stick ice cream instead
2175 2018-12-12 19:54:15 They are very concerned about the arbitrary nature of the tanker ban and the economic harm to their people & Canada as a whole.  There are abt 4,000 inbound oil tankers each yr on the east coast. Yet the northern coast of BC is subject to a ban that exists nowhere else in Canada.
2176 2018-12-12 19:54:06 This is an old video.
2177 2018-12-12 19:54:00 Someone just made +17.03% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 51.686 → 51.246 (20x leverage)  ~ BIG BOY $WTICO $USD
2178 2018-12-12 19:53:58 We use them with a combination of other dehydrated peppers & to make our chili oil & paste.
2179 2018-12-12 19:53:55 Erdogan cooperated with ISIS for years trading train loads of supplies for oil for his son Bilal's large 38+ ship tanker fleet.  In my opinion he now heads the largest group of radical islamic extremists in Syria.
Armageddon may soon be a reality in the mideast.

気分良くやりたいとか抜かすなら最初からしょうもないコメントしなくていいと思いますよ♡♡
2181 2018-12-12 19:53:51 The source for canola oil is also a little rapey.  We should ban it.
2182 2018-12-12 19:53:36 Cc @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @SecPompeo this is what happens when you give Iranians oil waivers and the same time your guys will end up hurting he the US energy Industry... rescind the waivers ASAP
2183 2018-12-12 19:53:36 Oil is used to create petrochemical products like many different types of plastics as well as polyester and other synthetic fabrics, not to mention fuels and lubricants. What clean, renewable products exits that can economically replace it?
2184 2018-12-12 19:53:36 I got a surprise for you baby, 
Ice cream, baby oil, and strawberries 
2185 2018-12-12 19:53:33 Oil investors concerned about supplies due to surginh U.S. output & uncertainty over how OPEC & its allies will implement production cuts have reason to worry about demand as well.
2186 2018-12-12 19:53:27 Bro!! lets do it!!I got the coconut oil ready! legggoo

**hits some extra tricep pulldowns***
2187 2018-12-12 19:53:25 Nah. You're just confused. Again, we are all Americans and deserve so much better.
2188 2018-12-12 19:53:23 I turn roaches into Oil or Budder. Sometimes I use an old dollar store flat iron and make dank dabs out of em, they're already resinated being roaches... I have about a half ounce bag of just roaches right now. But thankfully Im not hurting for bud at the moment.
2189 2018-12-12 19:53:04 Apparently an oil tanker tipped over and one of the biggest roads in the town is blocked off from beginning to end!
2190 2018-12-12 19:53:03 I want to draw with colored pencils again, but fuck that takes so much patience. I’d rather buy oil pastels again and draw with that than mess with colored pencils again.
2191 2018-12-12 19:53:00 Everyone should be angry every fucking election. Cause the winners are not the people. The winners are big pharm, big oil, big business. Yet every bitches about who won and that there guy or gal lost. While the mentioned above play us like a fiddle.
2192 2018-12-12 19:52:51 Gas crisis created intentionally by PMLn. Otherwise no sense in yearly maintence plan of ENGRO for December when gas requiremts are highest. OGRA monitors gas maintence prog.of oil/gas companies. What about LNG terminals maintenence schedule?
2193 2018-12-12 19:52:44 The “oil” should stay in the ground. Given the money in versus value out, whoever thought it was good math in the first place was the real dupe.
2194 2018-12-12 19:52:37 “Yeah I’d like to have an oil change, but I don’t have any money on me today”
Me: “ ok well when you have some money we can make it happen” 
The fuck is Waldorf
2195 2018-12-12 19:52:26 Great for your scalp and I use a face wash that contains it and haven't had a pimple since! It's a miracle oil!!
2196 2018-12-12 19:52:24 Then stop complaining 
2197 2018-12-12 19:52:10 I have an idea please make some pants anti oil when i eat i can put my dirty hands on my pants no problem
2198 2018-12-12 19:52:05 @RadioPaparazi the way Madrid is going down they might just discover crude oil #uefa #championslegue
2199 2018-12-12 19:51:51 Ofcourse not.

Labour allowed Scotland to Economically fail its people, while LOOTING Scotland's Oil Revenue for decades.
2200 2018-12-12 19:51:49 I don't hate you. There is the difference.
2201 2018-12-12 19:51:47 Why do I feel like “change oil” is code for something 
2202 2018-12-12 19:51:47 All revolting and filled with waxy palm oil.
2203 2018-12-12 19:51:43 Ha Oil
2204 2018-12-12 19:51:34 My sister’s pregnant and my aunt is trying to get her to take fish oil pills, but she keeps throwing up. My aunt gon say, “ you must have a bad gag reflex.. well we know what your not good at!” 
2205 2018-12-12 19:51:33 Heritage calling for ending big oil subsidies too??
2206 2018-12-12 19:51:33 Pretty sure this goes for both sides.  The problem is that both sides are getting played every election. Wether its dems or rebublican. The big businesses and the big pharm and big oil are the ones that sadly run this country. I mean the dems got played in the primaries.
2207 2018-12-12 19:51:32 @SatiarShah @jawnjang Jawn spends more money on moustache oil than caps will spend on players. Wake me when we join pro ranks
2208 2018-12-12 19:51:21 What is SNAKE OIL?
2209 2018-12-12 19:51:21 No. You really don't know your facts.
2210 2018-12-12 19:51:07 China wants all the oil
2211 2018-12-12 19:51:04 I use their shampoo, conditioner, and sealing cream  I was using olive oil but I’ma grab some Black Castor Oil today. I need a protective style 
2212 2018-12-12 19:51:00 I’m finna put this growth oil on my scalp 3x a week and see if it make my hair grow lol
2213 2018-12-12 19:51:00 Someone just made +18.90% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 51.735 → 51.246 (20x leverage)  ~ BIG BOY $WTICO $USD
2214 2018-12-12 19:51:00 I like that you argue that simply having some resources makes Alberta better. But somehow the ones that don't have those same resources are idiots because of their own failure. Their failure to do what? Have loads of oil? You're an idiot, stay in Alberta and please do separate.
2215 2018-12-12 19:50:57 On my days off, all I do is clean. Cleaned my car and did my oil field laundry. Now who wants a beer?
2216 2018-12-12 19:50:56 Or we just all compete to burn as much oil as possible because everyone dies eventually anyway
2217 2018-12-12 19:50:50 Not enough jobs in Houston, Texas. Work Force office told me all laid off Oil Gas workers have not been hired back. She said too many workers not enough jobs here. I can't easily move. Wife would lose her job. Economy hasn't turned around fully in Houston.
2218 2018-12-12 19:50:50 sauté in a dutch oven with a bit of oil and butter. add HOT liquid (water or stock) at a 2/3 ratio of rice to liquid. close lid and bake at 425 F for 20 minutes. remove from oven. rest 5 minutes. open and fluff.
2219 2018-12-12 19:50:41 Of course taxpayers can easily stop consuming all gas and oil to avoid the "fee". So simple.
2220 2018-12-12 19:50:40 TFW you find out that your favorite essential oil company donates 10% of profits to @YWAM. Byeee. 
2221 2018-12-12 19:50:23 Tell them that they are fools and that oil companies are the ones paying people to say shit (the GOP to pull out of Paris accord and give up on climate change)
2222 2018-12-12 19:50:13 Oh you missed all the palm oil in almost every single chocolate treat there is that's destroying the most vital carbon sinks on the planet.
2223 2018-12-12 19:50:10 Honestly it is a good thing, because it "VENTS" off geothermal activity, meaning pressure,
However, "smart people" now like to use this energy system, to actually pump oil out of the ground, (low cost) adding with the recent "fracking" we have been doing Mid-Western states
2224 2018-12-12 19:50:04 Am shamelessly on this table
2225 2018-12-12 19:50:01 I'm pissed you support a lying president, but I'm not tossing hate at you.
2226 2018-12-12 19:49:58 Is Hemp Oil illegal? Or just CBD Oil? In Canada, hemp oil is illegal.
2227 2018-12-12 19:49:53 @KremlinRussia_E and we’re god dam gonna buy oil patch you’ know! #liveslaw @Black Cat, don’t do thatplease.
2228 2018-12-12 19:49:40 do your products taste like pot??  I want an oil that has no thc or doesnt taste like pot
2229 2018-12-12 19:49:32 Jamaican castor oil. Or vitamin E oil mixed with lotion. That was my Winter in Lexington serum
2230 2018-12-12 19:49:18 Same with coconut oil and gogi berries!
2231 2018-12-12 19:49:09 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
2232 2018-12-12 19:49:08 Massaging your scalp with oil is so therapeutic
2233 2018-12-12 19:49:00 Got beard oil in my @Birchbox sooo I’m growing a beard.
2234 2018-12-12 19:48:57 An Oil of Olay commercial (& a load of companies in the #fashion & #beauty industry) ends w/ a stat claiming product excellence citing 74% of 115 women agree. 

Seriously,  you polled a whole 115 people.  Oooooo.... 

Could you seriously do less?
2235 2018-12-12 19:48:54 When I told people it's his money that makes the girl she's marrying consent they were arguing
2236 2018-12-12 19:48:54 Assuming there is no tectonic cultural shift at work here.

Valid question, how long before this tweet qualifies as hate speech in Canada? The cliff's edge is very close.
2237 2018-12-12 19:48:52 Would you like a rec for a good mental health professional?
2238 2018-12-12 19:48:49 How about diversifying the products made from oil.
2239 2018-12-12 19:48:26 Oil resort!
2240 2018-12-12 19:48:14 CBD is amazing. especially for body pain, i used CBD oil on my hips after I had the baby, it does wonders
2241 2018-12-12 19:48:06 “To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.”
Isaiah 61:3
2242 2018-12-12 19:48:03 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2243 2018-12-12 19:47:51 Chef McElroy cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with Silly Putty.
2244 2018-12-12 19:47:46 
2245 2018-12-12 19:47:41 By not allowing other provinces goods and services to pass through our "country" .
Better yet, stop the flow of our oil and gas to those provinces.
2246 2018-12-12 19:47:39 By then Mexico's emperor will finally have his refineries built and will denounce a complot since no one buys oil and car companies will be selling neoliberal vehicles
2247 2018-12-12 19:47:36 I have the BEST snake oil salesmen!
2248 2018-12-12 19:47:36 We’ll make it a Turkish oil wrestling match!
2249 2018-12-12 19:47:27 Also under the previous government, a complete oil crash and more debt than had ever been accumulated in our history.
2250 2018-12-12 19:47:14 They digging for oil in texas too and causing earthquakes there. Amma will always strike back!
2251 2018-12-12 19:47:05 Seriously, go check your facts.
2252 2018-12-12 19:47:04 the solution to not selling enough oil isn't to force people to produce less oil
2253 2018-12-12 19:47:01 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies ~You anoint my head with oil..... my cup overflows!
2254 2018-12-12 19:46:52 US #Stocks are paring gains as oil slides off intraday highs

Dow: +0.96%
S&P500: +0.92%

2255 2018-12-12 19:46:41 @FATGofficial the way Madrid is going down they might just discover crude oil #uefa #championslegue
2256 2018-12-12 19:46:20 How do you get @tobykeith and @tracy_lawrence with Luke Combs and Luke Bryan? It's like @HankJr & FGL or Oil & Water! Y'all do understand there is a HUGE difference, right?
2257 2018-12-12 19:46:15 getting a oil change finally. proud of me. <3
2258 2018-12-12 19:46:13 Does that translate to US traders buying our oil at deep discounts and reselling to China? How dumb are we all? Is Tides aware this is happening? Have they been paid to look the other way?
2259 2018-12-12 19:46:10 Thanks @mobeu2 for my free Oil change coupon at #HendricksHonda. 

This plate is legit. They have free snacks, coffee, and waters. I really wish I could afford to start bringing my car here. 
2260 2018-12-12 19:46:07 Who are you to say that?
2261 2018-12-12 19:46:03 ZANGANEH SAYS INDIA WAS USING #IRAN OIL SANCTION EXPEMPTIONS FOR GOVT REFINERIES: STATE TV. #OOTT
2262 2018-12-12 19:45:58 Crude oil futures for Jan/Feb lower again on Tuesday afternoon, $WTI_Crude -1.22% at $51.02 & $NBZ_F -0.18% at $60.09, $USO -0.96% at $10.84 on 12/12/2018.
2263 2018-12-12 19:45:39 How did Harper do when oil revenues  were pouring in & the $ was @ $150, not $45?  Was cutting the GST by 2% while signing extension after extension in a protracted & costly  WAR a wise decision or a political one , covered over with borrowed cash from the IMF?  $165 Billion(+/-)
2264 2018-12-12 19:45:32 If there's sinus congestion, hot water ± eucalyptus oil, then steam with a towel over your head and the water+oil  in a basin Or something
2265 2018-12-12 19:45:32 When the car shop calls you to see when you’re gonna come in and get your oil changed and fix the recall on your airbags <<< 
2266 2018-12-12 19:45:22 I have nothing against gear,oil,... if you claim natty, and your not, people get upset
2267 2018-12-12 19:45:05 No. Only in your mind because at the end of the day we are all still Americans. Only Trump has tried to divide this country like no other president in history. Very sad. We all deserve much better.
2268 2018-12-12 19:45:04 Is screaming 'NOOOO' in the car dealership while waiting for an oil change appropriate?? Who cares, NOOOOOOOO!!!!
2269 2018-12-12 19:45:01 I’ll use my THC cake for pain. It works, but not as well as the oil I got in CO. I think you really do need most of the native terpenes. Distilling pure THC doesn’t make it any more effective; it lessens the effect, actually.
2270 2018-12-12 19:45:00 Someone just made +20.06% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 51.738 → 51.219 (20x leverage)  ~ GRANDIOSE $WTICO $USD
2271 2018-12-12 19:45:00 Hope it's not the vegetable oil some pple scooped from the drainage abi gutter ooh 
2272 2018-12-12 19:44:43 ninan99 Yes, it is a fragile oil and the breakdown of fat when heated promotes inflammation. RT
2273 2018-12-12 19:44:34 Interestingly, if you look at the complete* picture, the real value of Scottish exports is down 8% after inflation. In the 5 years before it was up 11% after inflation.

*Semi complete, oil is excluded.
2274 2018-12-12 19:44:16 i’ll retweet for a chance to watch Dallas spank the Colts in Lucas Oil 
2275 2018-12-12 19:44:14 The Saudi’s oil has made the fossil fuel industry & Wall Street so rich they are a superpowers. It’s sick & a threat to democracies everywhere in the world. The world has to switch to renewables to save the environment & to break the grip the oligarchs have on our  governments.
2276 2018-12-12 19:43:54 Piers Morgan drinks a pint of palm oil each morning to start the day
2277 2018-12-12 19:43:47 .......add oil...............

2278 2018-12-12 19:43:42 He's invested in oil... As is Putin, heavily

So this also fits category 2
2279 2018-12-12 19:43:33 I’m a savory person. That means I’d prefer a spoonful of oil to a spoonful of sugar
2280 2018-12-12 19:43:32 My G650GS sertao has been a nightmare. (too much oil Pressure) Faulty decompression lever. Now the issues with the F750, and F850 GS's? Just backs up my opinion that if it is not the 1200 series, They don't really give a Rats ass. Portugal found this problem on the 650 Decomp UK

2283 2018-12-12 19:43:24 I had some dude try to tell me the same thing about China (not b/c of oil).  Where does this narrative come from?
2284 2018-12-12 19:43:24 That's not desire. That's the essential oil his MLM friend sold him
2285 2018-12-12 19:43:20 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
2286 2018-12-12 19:43:19 Facts matter. You clearly don't have any.
2287 2018-12-12 19:43:11 I like to walk and put peppermint oil (mines Doterra brand)
2288 2018-12-12 19:42:55 Forever loser and snake oil salesman CPL at it again.
2289 2018-12-12 19:42:55 How much money do you think gets Western Union back to Mexico? What is Mexico's second largest form of income next to oil?
2290 2018-12-12 19:42:52 We already have rice at home, so we'll half kilo of chicken #600 and tomato and bell pepper and oil with the #400. Thank you
2291 2018-12-12 19:42:43 Is this guy trying to tell you Russia doesn't have the capability to build advanced weapons because oil is cheap?
2292 2018-12-12 19:42:43 Dear Cabal, sorry I commited genocide for cabal oil but you just wouldn't give it me would you?! Well now your people are extinct but please know that as you fade into the sands of time that the last trace that your people existed will be placed into a baked confection.
2293 2018-12-12 19:42:33 Using oil for fuel to grow corn for fuel doesn't make sense. And then we have to nerve to ask why there is hunger in the world? We The People have to work with Nature, the government doesn't know how. #give_2_receive_
2294 2018-12-12 19:42:21 He Didn't Know That Maurice Strong Needed a New Revenue Stream for the UN after Oil for Food Skim Ran Out!!!!!!!  That's Where the Bravo Sierra has Come From!!!!!!!!
2295 2018-12-12 19:42:13 I’ve managed to put off this oil change for this whole fucking week somebody please stop me

2298 2018-12-12 19:41:48 I’m so tired of all these Pinterest recipes that call for just olive oil, salt and pepper 
2299 2018-12-12 19:41:24 I always use the extra shampoos for bubble baths! With a bit of coconut oil that I take with me on flights
2300 2018-12-12 19:41:22 No it's honey & Olive Oil
2301 2018-12-12 19:41:22 The new axis of [OIL] evil is Trump, Putin and MBS. They have to disregard environment or it impacts profits.
2302 2018-12-12 19:41:13 Steam +eucalyptus oil. Don't over do the oil, stuff can be nasty but will clear you up like nobodies business. Other than that a curry will help clear you up a bit.
2303 2018-12-12 19:40:52 Soap-Making. You can make laundry soaps in the home & sell to u4 neighbors, grocery stores, students etc. 
All u need is soda & oil. Perfumes are optional. 
Use the bowls in ur home. Check YouTube for the process or dm me for my soap making model.
2304 2018-12-12 19:40:46 I use Jackson Galaxy's stress stopper oil for short term travel with our kitties. I've heard the feliway products are good too. But there is no shame in getting some medication from the vet to calm them down.
2305 2018-12-12 19:40:40 Charisma doesn’t put food in people’s stomachs or provide them with shelter. Only policies & principles can do that, and a Blairite snake oil salesman who voted for hundreds to die in Iraq will never be that person.

2317 2018-12-12 19:39:50 Hello I just wanna know why the HELL my oil change is SEVENTY-NINE DOLLARS ????? Like just stick some great value vegetable oil in it and we can all get on with our lives
2318 2018-12-12 19:39:47 Yes, it is a fragile oil and the breakdown of fat when heated promotes inflammation.
2319 2018-12-12 19:39:46 Facts and our 5-time draft dodger coward-in-chief president mix like oil and water
2320 2018-12-12 19:39:42 You have my follow for saying oil mill. #phvity
2321 2018-12-12 19:39:19 Good afternoon, I just came very close to putting sesame oil instead of honey in my green tea.
2322 2018-12-12 19:39:13 Sen. Bill Nelson, in final address to US Senate, calls on it to make health care more accessible & cost effective; assist Puerto Rico; keep oil rigs off Florida’s shores; protect the environment from pollution. The Florida Democrat said he intends to keep fighting for Florida.
2323 2018-12-12 19:39:10 How many of y’all know how to fix a car, change a tire, or change the oil in your car? – This is pertaining to men.
2324 2018-12-12 19:39:05 I want to say it shouldn't, but I'd do a double check. MBUSA usually throws out some ridiculous work quotes- but you should be paying between 150 and 200 for an oil change there
2325 2018-12-12 19:38:49 The Bull boys. Prostitutes!
2326 2018-12-12 19:38:46 Energy names, $XLE and $OIH outperforming $SPY by a lot today and this is despite $OIL down 1%. Potentially a change of character as energy has been a severe laggard last few weeks, being unable to bounce even when $OIL bounces
2327 2018-12-12 19:38:37 Is coconut oil safe as eye makeup remover as well?
2328 2018-12-12 19:38:26 The fact remains we NEED oil and gas. And the demand is growing. So NOT wanting pipelines is beyond comprehension. We need to declare pipelines a NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST. #MadMax2019 #PPC2019 #LibConsOut
2329 2018-12-12 19:38:24 Stopped taking fish oil for one week and my hips started creaking. If this what aging is like, yall can keep it.
2330 2018-12-12 19:38:24 There is too much chaotic energy in people who do that....like people who eat the skin on a kiwi and dry swallow cod liver oil tablets. Absolutely no need

2332 2018-12-12 19:38:15 Guess what, Rachel? We might rely On Alta’s oil & gas but we also share the same waters, air & land. What’s happened in Alberta is a global environmental disaster, & as we are learning THE ENVIRONMENT HAS NO PRICE. So get real & start shifting Alta’s focus toward a greener future

2346 2018-12-12 19:36:47 Perhaps Quebec is allot like the rest of Canada in the sense that those living in the rural areas think much differently than those living in the urban centers. Much easier to be anti oil when you have mass transit and have less of a need to even own a vehicle.
2347 2018-12-12 19:36:39 Where you think there is no cash, cash flows like water! No one wanted to leave in a desert till oil was discovered!
2348 2018-12-12 19:36:37 Did mainly non-oil hedge funds get bored in Aug/Sept with equities, get into /CL with this time of yr contracts and the real oil players f"d them all? @EnergyRosen  Just a thought
2349 2018-12-12 19:36:32 Oil and gas companies like @Shell and @exxonmobil now trying to promote new low emission biofuels from algae. They've known about global warming and its effects since the 1980s, yet they kept on (and keep on) peddling oil that will inevitably lead to further warming. (1/2)
2350 2018-12-12 19:36:14 A $700.00 parka is a necessity when you "flee" to a freezing cold country where you're not allowed to touch oil.

2358 2018-12-12 19:35:30 I wouldn't be able to comment on % of oil changes lead to selling additional work but most of it was from repeat customers. They started with the warrenty at the dealer and some free oil changes. Continued coming to the dealer for maintenance and when their car broke came to us.
2359 2018-12-12 19:35:26 Armstrong isn’t far off. SECDEF is stretching—really stretching—the linkage. Like linking the use of boiling oil in the defense of Orléans during the Hundred Years’ War to the development of air-dropped napalm munitions in the 1940s. An entertaining but implausible strrretch.
2360 2018-12-12 19:35:23 NO clue what causes recessions or downturns. More than just who's President. Depends on global events, during wartime, post-war time, oil prices, etc. Just to name a few. But hey, you have some cute memes to ejicate us economic idjits.

2411 2018-12-12 19:29:17 It needed to be. They go after a small single income person for $50 in taxes whilst letting the Pelosis, Clintons, Sanders of the world file false reports. 

Don't get me started on the waste of payroll hours they used to get my $50 when I had a calc error. It was 6x >$50.

He leans in again, lips closing around Sebastian’s cockhead, that clever tongue lavishing it with attention.

2429 2018-12-12 19:27:39 No he didn't, that is a clear disingenuous over simplification of what he said. Sirota suggested that a sexual fervor for a candidate who is a top recipient of oil industry donations to run for president would worsen climate change. Implying that was sexist is ridiculous.

2437 2018-12-12 19:27:18 Yep they use Brominated Vegetable Oil. They, "gov't" regularors and PepsiCo, say the amount  of bromine is negligible, but ANY amount is harmful. Bromine can't be metabolized so it just sits in your system. And builds up over time.
2438 2018-12-12 19:27:18 No country asks USA to get involve, we get involved ourselves because is to our benefit. How do you think USA gets its wealth? Drugs, gold, oil, war and death brings lots of revenue.
2439 2018-12-12 19:27:15 If you have type 4 hair the best deep conditioning trick is your fav moisturizing conditioner, honey, grape seed oil, and a nice hair serum. microwave it for 15-20 seconds and apply to your hair for 30 minutes or more and yall!!! ya hair is gonna feel like silk
2440 2018-12-12 19:26:54 So you really did get repeats from it and get on-the-spot fixes too? Like 10% of the oil changes led to profit? Or 1%?

As someone who fixes his own car I just have no reference for this...
2441 2018-12-12 19:26:54 I sleep great!  You should try a little CBD OIL to get that mind of yours to stop dreaming

2453 2018-12-12 19:25:25 Love Cozens (especially that he learned to play hockey where I did) but Dach is just as good, in my view.  I'd like to see Dach fly under the radar so the Oil can grab him.  We'll all learn more at the world juniors.

2455 2018-12-12 19:25:15 I THINK THEY COME FROM THE OIL. that’s why i avoid it at all cost. it has so many calories for no reason at all
2456 2018-12-12 19:25:14 R us aware that AB has paid $220 billion more in taxes in the last 10 years than it received in payments and services back from the federal government? All we want is to get the product to mkt. But this screwed up country won't let it happen. So it NOT oil prices, it IS policy
2457 2018-12-12 19:25:11 We do not buy arms from them, the payment is part of a concessions deal for oil as well as other trade/security agreements. The same type made to Israel and other mid east countries.
2458 2018-12-12 19:25:06 It wasn't Trump. The shale revolution is due to the oil industry and the private sector. It started during Bush's Presidency actually.

2463 2018-12-12 19:24:37 Used car salesmen?  Inmates?  Snake oil salesmen? A panhandler?
2464 2018-12-12 19:24:35 There’s a port in Seattle as well...

The only thing we really ship through Van is grain.  Shut in the existing TM line, and push our oil exports through the US. it’s where the vast majority of unrefined product goes anyhow.
2465 2018-12-12 19:24:29 How much of recent oil supply/price is being influenced by politics as apposed to natural supply and demand?  Makes it hard to

2467 2018-12-12 19:24:25 Are there any Middle East oil barons that want to start an expansion NBA team in Phoenix and pour lots of money into it? Cuz that would be sweet.
2468 2018-12-12 19:24:23 It is a princely sum but if your desire is to control the production and supply of Alberta oil to forward the "phase out the Oil Sands" agenda, I guess it's mission accomplished at the expense of the Canadian economy. Smooth move.
2469 2018-12-12 19:24:19 Oil doesn't cause hurricanes but burning it creates warmer oceans that create more intense storms not to mention melting glaciers and rising sea levels.

2475 2018-12-12 19:23:36 Ya think? Where have you been hiding the last 10 years? Maybe tell that to your sock wearing boss and his boyfriend Butts as well as climate Barbie. Or do they still prefer the blood oil from Saudi Arabia? Where’s the pipeline then?
2476 2018-12-12 19:23:35 Shauna, other than the obvious-self care/watching what one eats/exercise/fluids?  Acupuncture. Thieves oil can help too.  For colds? Echinacea and vitamin C.  As you know from being an educator, that helps too because of all those germs.
2477 2018-12-12 19:23:32 I came home around 2 o'clock today and Thomas said "must turn the heating off" sitting here at 20 past 7 and sweating like fuck, bastard forgot to turn it off @ Thomas oil is not free u ass

2479 2018-12-12 19:23:14 Wait until the President asks for 1 billion from the parastatal you are heading 

You will even spill all the oil to ensure the cash is delivered.
2480 2018-12-12 19:23:13 are men just born knowing how to fix leaks & change oil & other manly things? like how the hell are most of you so knowledgeable about random stuff like that?
2481 2018-12-12 19:23:12 You're darker than Akon talking bout you're mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?
2482 2018-12-12 19:23:01 That's the reason the confab report is not being implemented.
The Govt do their budget solely on Crude oil sales, not from tax or from  solid minerals. It's annoying but my joy is that soon oil will not economically viable and there the real Nigeria will be unveiled.
2483 2018-12-12 19:22:52 I feel like that only scratches the surface—I think the gas tax only became so high in France once living standards plateaued in the '70s as part of a deliberate policy to avoid dependence on unfriendly oil producers
2484 2018-12-12 19:22:49 Hemp oil with CBD.
2485 2018-12-12 19:22:45 I am worried we only 50 years of proven oil & gas reserves and 50-70% of total reserves are guesstimates. We have insufficient O&Gas to create the global warming we're all being fear-mongered with. Today's youth will inherit an energy depleted planet as we reenter the ice age.
2486 2018-12-12 19:22:41 Perhaps once the OPEC+ reductions actually take effect, then we will see crude oil price go higher. Similar circumstances existed in 2016.
2487 2018-12-12 19:22:25 You wanted reasons why socialism appeals. I mentioned if you don’t like it then capitalism is the only other current option? Was Corbyn supposed to pre-empt the lack of diversification in the economy and reliance on oil?
2488 2018-12-12 19:22:15 In this week's commodity market update, we look at how OPEC's agreement to reduce oil production will affect the balance of global crude oil supply and demand. We also analyze how US and World Ending Stocks 1/2

2496 2018-12-12 19:21:19 Gray, 4 door sedan in good condition. Mechanical is excellent, recently oil changed and ready to hit the road. 
195K miles and still on the road daily. $3600.00 4 cylinder 28/32mpg
2497 2018-12-12 19:21:17 Exactly many opportunities out there.
As you say Oil etc, tech companies Amazon , Facebook Apple talk of them dabbling into sport, Finance etc Murdoch is apparently moving into the Venture Capital world.
2498 2018-12-12 19:21:14 Are oil companies a branch of the government?
2499 2018-12-12 19:21:12 What are you prepared to sacrifice to get rid of oil? That neat little device you are tweeting on would not exist without oil and no renewable fuel/energy option exits to replace it.
2500 2018-12-12 19:20:52 I’m really really not impressed with your 2002 mustang gt with 250k miles on it that hasn’t had the oil changed in 6 months. 

“But its a gt” 

Oh yeah? Eat a dick
2501 2018-12-12 19:20:52 This doesn't change the fact that it's not a police issue that cars are allowed. Unfortunately (for you, not most of us) cars are legal and will continue to be as long as the popular vote decides who makes our laws, which is basically forever. Troll a motor group or oil company.

2506 2018-12-12 19:20:25 Our dependence on Saudi oil helps them by giving them the money and resources they need, thus enabling them in a war such as this. It’s in America’s best interest to embrace renewable energy.
2507 2018-12-12 19:20:07 You don't 'wash' it out... But coconut oil and time would do the trick
2508 2018-12-12 19:20:06 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This December, read labels carefully.
2509 2018-12-12 19:19:59 Just got to the dealership and they already trying to offer me specials. Just change my oil please 
2510 2018-12-12 19:19:55 True, we should and would be in control. I'd expect some sort of grab from England on resources. If Scotland left the Union it would be English oil in the North Sea. If we send x billion gallons of water to England yearly, they won't let us shut off the tap.
2511 2018-12-12 19:19:52 To top the oil? Why would I pay for that I drive less than 5k miles a year
2512 2018-12-12 19:19:50 Alberta has always had a boom and bust whether it’s oil, gas or agriculture. What’s unfair is that when we are down we get pissed on by Ottawa and still pay into a transfer payment system that doles out extortion money to Quebec. Did you know their Hydro is not calculated?
2513 2018-12-12 19:19:46 Yes especially for my hair, its helping with my length and thickness. My friend struggles with acne and she started using black seed oil, it helped her so much!

2533 2018-12-12 19:16:55 Alberta Premier @RachelNotley is totally justified in putting an #Oilsands #GHG cap on hold. @albertaNDP deal with enviro-devils didn't pan out, as #greenjobs were a mirage, #ENGOs never relented & US made $100s M on Alta's cheap oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli @CanadianGreens

2536 2018-12-12 19:16:39 Besides denouncing US coup plans and throwing out lofty oil investment figures, Maduro said at press conference he watches @BloombergTV every day, "just ask my wife," adding it's channel 710 on his cable in Caracas. He's not a fan of the Venezuela stories though, "too negative."

2542 2018-12-12 19:16:10 There isn't enough profit to be made on oil changes unless it's a quick lube place paying its techs 9 dollars an hour. Paying an experienced flat rate tech soaks up most of the profits. But being experienced we did the work quick lube places couldn't, and on high end cars.

2552 2018-12-12 19:15:13 We’d be asking average persons to be responsible and not spend yearly rebate on a new TV or something they want, not need. Another solution is a trigger word among capitalists. Oil companies need to be nationalized, and all profits used to help pay for the #GreenNewDeal.
2553 2018-12-12 19:15:11 The CIA overthrew the democratic Iranian government for an oil company, and the Guatemala gov for United Fruit.

2556 2018-12-12 19:15:05 5) if we’re not part of the solution we r part of the problem- protesting big oil pipelines is just a start- we need to show a better way that lifts all up, eliminates pollution, oil wars, inequality etc such as solar power. We need solutions that make old ways obsolete not blame
2557 2018-12-12 19:15:02 Different cooking oils have different flash temps. Olive oil is relatively low. Flax seed oil is one of the lowest. Canola oil or avacado oil would be better and degrade the oil less. With all that said it will be fine to use olive oil.

2562 2018-12-12 19:14:37 Great idea, i am sure many people in Quebec see the common sense of using CDN oil over imported. It must drive those anti Alberta oil folks crazy that you have the ability to discuss the merits of AB oil in their own language and they can’t control the narrative

2564 2018-12-12 19:14:36 Well gee, that's a hell of a double standard. Not to mention inaccurate. Or was that an imposter @realDonaldTrump tweeting about how OPEC needs to keep the oil flowing cheap enough to discourage energy sufficiency?
2565 2018-12-12 19:14:29 The point is someone who is a climate denier and invested in the oil industry is not an impartial judge of climate change regulation and support of the oil industry. Sounds like the person is taking care of their own self interest and not the greater good.

2591 2018-12-12 19:12:00 Well, maybe the fact that she’s been at the helm of the destruction of the Oil Industry in Alta might have something to do with it.
2592 2018-12-12 19:11:57 and once again, you're not helping trying to change my mind. you keep giving rhetoric, no legislation from the party platform. you've not answered my questions. you've ignored my thoughts and only played repeat with your BS fear mongering.
2593 2018-12-12 19:11:36 In the mix or just for the choice of oil to cook with?

2595 2018-12-12 19:11:17 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2596 2018-12-12 19:11:15 I have always thought that your support your city,province, country with your wallet in regards to purchases. I buy Canadian made GM,Ford, Chrysler vehicles.  But Canadians continue to import oil when we have the 3rd largest reserves why????? Political ignorance that's why
2597 2018-12-12 19:11:15 Oil panic qui sert de reflect maintenant, what the Nep
2598 2018-12-12 19:11:02 Oil

2600 2018-12-12 19:10:55 Crap!  Heating oil delivery.  There goes about $600 I would have prefered to spend elsewhere!
2601 2018-12-12 19:10:44 sana oil fresh haha
2602 2018-12-12 19:10:42 Jason, investors left the oil patch long before Notley was premier.  Consecutive failures by Alberta and Federal CPC government coupled with a drop in price saw to that.
2603 2018-12-12 19:10:39 Wouldn't it be sad if we weren't Fracking & paying $5 a gallon for gas or being held hostage to foreign oil?
But I guess it wouldn't bother you as you walk or ride a bicycle to your hut in the woods without electricity or anything made with oil byproducts, right? Just wondering.
2604 2018-12-12 19:10:38 if you think that is bad look into oil.

2608 2018-12-12 19:10:10 I love these products but the shampoo bars are made with sulfates and not color safe. R&B definitely helps with damage though! And the NEW shampoo bar and hot oil treatment are both really good for hair growth :)
2609 2018-12-12 19:10:03 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2610 2018-12-12 19:10:02 Endless oil story
2611 2018-12-12 19:09:59 Yes, I’ve tried with using too much water, little water and no water. I have the treadmill silicone, coconut oil. I’ve done different ratios and not the best luck /:
2612 2018-12-12 19:09:59 Hmmmmm bet yyyyy
2613 2018-12-12 19:09:50 and adoption*
2614 2018-12-12 19:09:48 like the oil companies just want to sell oil - the warming is a side effect. the guys buying farmland in siberia and deepwater ports along the northwest passage tho...
2615 2018-12-12 19:09:42 Since the 1800s, when oil became the fossil fuel of choice for global energy, the big corporations have guarded their cash-cow with lethal ruthlessness and utter disregard for legal and moral constraints. They'll ride this enviromentally disastrous money train to the bitter end.

2619 2018-12-12 19:09:28 Hey Aidan and Jake! Get an oil change today. Love, Mom/Becki @jailsocks
2620 2018-12-12 19:09:18 Exaaaaccctttly, "do you want oil?" after putting on oil that I certainly didn't want
2621 2018-12-12 19:09:18 Hi @NutellaGlobal @NutellaUSA what are you doing to stop using palm oil in your products? My mum @susanhide2 wants to know too. Even though we love Nutella I can’t buy any more till you stop using it as an ingredient.
2622 2018-12-12 19:09:12 Someone remind me to go to CVS to get some coconut oil
2623 2018-12-12 19:09:07 2001 called and they want Peak Oil back. Funny how ecomarxists forget all the stupid alarmists predictions of the last 20 years. Enjoy your subsidized 85K Kia powered by rare minerals extracted by childrens in Congo 
2624 2018-12-12 19:09:05 Ok I managed to find the car oil for my car and I bought the tyre inflator thingy 
2625 2018-12-12 19:08:56 2 eggs, 600 grams of sugar 600 grams of self raising flour, cook using butter not oil. Thank me later
2626 2018-12-12 19:08:55 Big man, U don mash ball already. Now u get for use formular 24 if u still like ya work & the freebies. By changing oil for the engine. 
Or u tell contact HR if she no wan reason with  u . 
Friendship no go work. U were brutally honest. Somethings are better not said
2627 2018-12-12 19:08:46 Right! Like a couple girls almost slipped and fell last week from the oil spots on the floor. I’ve seen girls who have been there a while do it too, I swear you can’t tell them anything. But I think this problem is definitely new girls
2628 2018-12-12 19:08:43 a huge long term worry i have is we're now creating constituencies of people who will be directly (rather than indirectly like oil companies) harmed by reversing or halting warming and will lobby against it
2629 2018-12-12 19:08:25 When i read news like this it bothers me..... the 2018 budget is 8.6 trn.... so with customs remittance and oil proceeds are we not supposed to have a surplus.... yet the budget is never fully implemented.
2630 2018-12-12 19:08:10 Nope. He left the RCN after mom was born and moved west to work in the oil industry. I do have his copy of “Ad Man Seamanship” though. I keep it next to the pepper grinder...Cause it’s “salty”
2631 2018-12-12 19:08:06 Vegeble oil for sure. I never use it except in the pan to help brown the pancakes. 

I’d follow the recipe and make changes next time as you see fit.
2632 2018-12-12 19:08:06 Thank goodness for eucalyptus oil 
2633 2018-12-12 19:08:04 What are you prepared to sacrifice if oil were to disappear overnight?
2634 2018-12-12 19:08:01 #ANGS could multibag in next few days as Brockham taps are turned on. Permission for 6 wells so whatever we get from 1st should rerate the sp as future production is factored in. £11m tax break means that we can sell oil from Well 1 and use proceeds to drill Well 2 and so on...

2636 2018-12-12 19:08:00 And this is an oil rich country ! Socialism has literally failed this country.
2637 2018-12-12 19:07:59 Remember she campaigned on getting rid of oil. She shut down a clean burning coal power plant x2 that increases our cost and she was against the pipeline. All until she realized that’s where the money comes from

2640 2018-12-12 19:07:47 My guess is also that whatever was used, it would get subverted by institutional bureaucracy. But, where does Moodle sit with the story of the snake oil sellers? How did an open source, self hosted thing turn out to be so shite?
2641 2018-12-12 19:07:43 PELASE BE QUIET??????? GAY COCNUT OIL HATER I CANT STSND YOU
2642 2018-12-12 19:07:42 Looks like you intend to hamstring the oil industry in a last gasp effort to cripple it permanently before you are kicked to the curb. SMH. Sheeeesh.
2643 2018-12-12 19:07:23 Thanks so much, that's really kind of you. So far I've been using peppermint oil for headaches.
2644 2018-12-12 19:07:13 Ok so if ur pancake recipe calls for a tbsp of oil can you use olive oil
2645 2018-12-12 19:07:10 To get the government we actually vote for. To get rid of the Nuclear Weapons that have been dumped on our doorstep. To use our resources like oil/natural gas/whisky and function as an independent member of the EU, while ridding ourselves of right wing tossers from the south.
2646 2018-12-12 19:07:09 Remove all tariffs. Remove restrictions on free trade. Let the market determine the price of oil, gas, steel, food, water, currency. Within a short time the real growth will show up. Not this artificial state sponsored, borrowed attempt.
2647 2018-12-12 19:07:05 I think I will buy the 10L mtungi on cooking oil alafu nisahau hio maneno for like 6 months
2648 2018-12-12 19:06:54 the recipe calls for oil.....olive oil?
2649 2018-12-12 19:06:54 When the exon Valdez happened, I remember many of my catches ruined because the fish buyers couldn't deal with the oil on the fish.
 I'm not against the pipeline, I want it. 
 I also want satisfactory marine safety requirements in place before it goes ahead. Simple.
2650 2018-12-12 19:06:49 Cheers :) it doesn’t smell like burning oil.
2651 2018-12-12 19:06:47 US CRUDE STOCKS - Oil futures seesaw on EIA crude stock data: LONDON (ICIS)--Crude oil prices stumbled on a mixed US crude… @environmentguru
2652 2018-12-12 19:06:28 When you think of the early 1900s and the 1800s it’s in black and white but if you think about the 1500s it’s in color or oil painting
2653 2018-12-12 19:06:11 Wow! that's really good. If you saw what I have to go through just to give Brynni her antibiotic. Hahaha. I'd probably end up with more of the oil in my eyes than in her mouth.

2655 2018-12-12 19:05:57 Yeah, losing power and, subsequently heat, sucks. We have a couple of indoor oil heaters for just such occasions. Definitely worth the investment.

2657 2018-12-12 19:05:54 Hello Steven. Thank you for reaching out. We know that a major repair like an oil leak is frustrating. We're sorry for the inconvenience, but we recommend getting in touch with our friends @VWUKHelp for further assistance. They would be able to look into this for you. -SW
2658 2018-12-12 19:05:50 Wierd we pay in 55/60billion scotsgov gets just under 30billion apparently we pay the other 30billion for defence and EU fees ye and I'm the monopoly man, none of those come close to 10billion nevermind 30 and I haven't counted our oil funds. Like I said we are self sufficient.
2659 2018-12-12 19:05:50 Smh Tessa ur work literally does oil changes

2661 2018-12-12 19:05:38 Amount released after sanctions as high. As $150 billion which is a highest estimate we hve seen. Another estimate from Iran's Central Bank topped out at $29 Billion tied up in Chinese investment projects plus the foreign assets of Iran's Oil Ministry. 150 Billion was given but..

2663 2018-12-12 19:05:10 When the CBD oil hit 
2664 2018-12-12 19:05:08 I tried CBD oil a few months ago and that alone has helped me with my anxiety and eczema flare ups...before that I was taking a medication for the eczema which was barely working and making me naseaus and constantly throwing up. CBD hasn’t done that.
2665 2018-12-12 19:05:04 Put CBD oil on my head cause I’m so god damn hungover at work. It actually helps
2666 2018-12-12 19:04:57 It's not the fear of oil workers' strike but his conscience acting. He knew this all along buplgt to busy trying not to step on toes ( those that contributed to his presidencial campaign financially)
2667 2018-12-12 19:04:56 Nothin slick to a can of oil
2668 2018-12-12 19:04:55 i wanna get 45% cbd oil but i dont have money money
2669 2018-12-12 19:04:50 Baba they give them hot hot wallai
2670 2018-12-12 19:04:46 I Did work for an engineering company. [Enter Common AngloSaxon Last Name] Engineers, no idea they were oil field engineers. If Koch industries wasn't famous for it's founders, we'd all gloss over it too.
2671 2018-12-12 19:04:42 they didn't even fight for rights. they fought for a demand of equal treatment. I don't want people to be forced to accept me. I want them to chose to, the left doesn't because of my views on everything. so they've all but pushed me into the right, where I'll happily live.
2672 2018-12-12 19:04:39 Flirt with the oil change people. Get that discount.
2673 2018-12-12 19:04:39 do you have a breakdown of sectors? Wonder if oil/gas is a chunk of it (or will become a leader on lower oil)
2674 2018-12-12 19:04:38 Yeah, the free speech of big oil companies is obviously in jeopardy, since you have no way to get your message out!

Or do you... 
2675 2018-12-12 19:04:32 That is a quality name IMO

I am unsure on oil.  I do like Nat gas.  

Every cyclical sector is getting crushed together.  Really wondering about next year's eco data.
2676 2018-12-12 19:04:30 The oil and gas service sector is going to hit hard though. Not sure people understand the implications of this.... #ABpoli
2677 2018-12-12 19:04:26 Put tea tree oil on it and they should dry up overnight 
2678 2018-12-12 19:04:00 In a new assessment, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated these untapped regions in the Delaware Basin of the Permian contained 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.  Wowww !! #Oil #Gas
2679 2018-12-12 19:03:57 I think i found people my age in my class. But they talk about oil and politics.
2680 2018-12-12 19:03:51 Sweeping comprehensive reforms always seem to have negative aspects built in that cancel out the positive. Is this an as yet undefined law of the universe?
2681 2018-12-12 19:03:46 What industry do you think she'll lobby for? Media, oil, banking, defense?
2682 2018-12-12 19:03:45 "First the earth cooled. And, then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died, and they turned into oil..."
2683 2018-12-12 19:03:25 Tea tree oil cures everything, I’m convinced. Between that & Vick’s you never need to see a doctor 
2684 2018-12-12 19:03:20 I'm headed to Gardner soon (whenever I get outta bed) to get my oil changed, then going to my mom's
2685 2018-12-12 19:03:14 It once was coconut oil
2686 2018-12-12 19:02:57 Also, explain the treatment of trees, which is even more stupid. According to UN, these turn to gas as soon as they are cut down. There are no wooden houses, furniture or books. But the UN says oil only turns to gas when it is burned. Disadvantages NZ. We would ignore the rule.
2687 2018-12-12 19:02:57 $Oil is sending a terrible signal. rallies cant hold anymore
2688 2018-12-12 19:02:56 Cause black Penn and discretion are like water and oil 
2689 2018-12-12 19:02:55 I’d be the one out in Walmart parking lot waiting for them to leave ...& then go ahead and stock up for the next month or so . Fuck all the killin, go to auto zone, get some new parts for the car, oil and everything
2690 2018-12-12 19:02:42 Jesus be an oil change
2691 2018-12-12 19:02:40 A lot of people thought it would be over oil. Even I thought so briefly when Jimmy Carter was in office.
2692 2018-12-12 19:02:37 A fucked up point of view to have is that it’s okay for civilians to be sentenced to death when they live in a country full of oil that we want, but that it’s not okay for government officials to be sentenced to death when they buttfuck children.
2693 2018-12-12 19:02:36 Ang dami ring neoliberal policies patungkol sa transpo system,

jeepney phaseout / privitization of public utilities for transpo, deregulation on oil prices etc.
2694 2018-12-12 19:02:02 If you want to treat miners ,oil & gas workers, & investors right I would start by reinstating the Uptick Rule & Glass Steagall. Stop the Fed/Treasury HFT war on commodities. #Collusion #DeepCapture
2695 2018-12-12 19:01:56 Like, the value of oil is going to go down no matter what at this point as more countries go renewable and demand goes down. If we don't diversify our economy now we will be ruined in 10 to 20 years
2696 2018-12-12 19:01:49 Ala, estás vainas que estamos pasando con el grupo AVAL y Sarmiento Angulo las pasaron los gringos con Rockefeller y la Standard Oil hace más de medio siglo, estamos muuy atrasados mis chinos.
2697 2018-12-12 19:01:45 Trump's stance on the environment:  We're giving this country over to the developers & polluters, including all public lands and coastal waters, for free.  Get over it suckers, u lost the election, so choke on coal dust, drink chemical spills, and admire the oil rig view.
2698 2018-12-12 19:01:40 Don’t forget your own currency. High tarrifs for oil and products crossing into Canada to get oil to market. A police force as well.
2699 2018-12-12 19:01:34 Heard that Koskinen was brought in by someone else, they had to convince Chia to get him. Many say Hitchcock was also an outsider job, perhaps Bob Nicholson? The OEG is aware of this, they can either fire him asap and show glimpses of a new era or they’ll just be the old Oil.
2700 2018-12-12 19:01:31 We Dems need to start playing hardball & repeal the law allowing oil cos to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
I am starting an account to track & gather legislative support for this.Stand by :-))))
2701 2018-12-12 19:01:12 My coworkers threatening to quit because i’ve decided I will only be referred to as Essential Oil Daddy and will only answer questions involving The 1975 minus the song Robbers because we don’t talk about that bye for now
2702 2018-12-12 19:01:05 Tragic is that you believe that. California has mismanaged their forests for decades. Coal mining, fracking,drilling for oil, all of it somehow falls at @POTUS feet. You surely are not that obtuse. Are you¿
2703 2018-12-12 19:01:00 He did, but we all did. My husband has been worried about the oil countries ever since the ayatollah khomeini.
2704 2018-12-12 19:00:57 Lemon Oil, Rosemary and Bergamot!
2705 2018-12-12 19:00:57 But, I'm willing to bet the 7000 new railcars for #Alberta oil will go to them......
2706 2018-12-12 19:00:43 What would you do if the EU passed a law nationalising all mineral resources (oil, gold, silver....)? It could happen after the EU Elections. It is not just about economics, it is also about our RIGHTS! RIGHTS long term!

2710 2018-12-12 19:00:19 Lol I lost a lot of hair when I moved here because of the water quality and so I’ve been careful not to use too many chemicals on my hair. I apply oil and all that for general hair health, and spend whatever money I could have used for hair products on makeup instead 
2711 2018-12-12 19:00:14 Vocal Trump ally and shitty liberal Joe #Manchin has taken more than $1 million throughout his career from coal, oil, and gas industries. He continues to support coal energy. He still earns money from a coal brokerage company he ran prior to his senatorial career.

2713 2018-12-12 19:00:03 It's funny because renewables would probably solve these problems. Much less reason to import electricity when everyone can produce it locally in most places. Removes dependencies on trading and shipping oil.
2714 2018-12-12 18:59:50 People are dying in Alberta because of the Greens and the Liberals. Poverty is up, suicide is way up, but oil patch workers don’t matter to you. I wonder if it would be different if they worked in BC Fisheries or Logging. Would you care then? #BuildKM
2715 2018-12-12 18:59:42 Oh you are painting with Oil?!! Amazing 
I'm tempted to try it but it's kinda of dangerous/unsafe
2716 2018-12-12 18:59:37 That newspaper gonna soak up the oil good. Differently... I would mash that now
2717 2018-12-12 18:59:30 Cooked a new pot food...started like garlic,onion pepper oil fried,than added red cabbages with water,than added,parsley root,carrot,potatoes rosemary,thyme,4 pepper and salt...:)
2718 2018-12-12 18:59:26 Listen... my kid made the BEST poop today while I was completing essential oil sales and monitoring my crypto holdings. Obviously you need to keep me in your life. #CarneyStaysin2019
2719 2018-12-12 18:59:14 my face is saturated in coconut oil 
2720 2018-12-12 18:59:02 I remember when I said I wasn’t getting another oil change until 2019. Jokes on me
2721 2018-12-12 18:58:59 when im really mad at my mom i put hot sauce in the oil diffuser just so the house can smell like ass
2722 2018-12-12 18:58:54 The modern day Revolution. I was taught The French Revolution by aCatholic Nun. The 4th Industrial Revolution is delivering the upgraded version. Bread  turned Oil or Petrol.  I'm watching with interest. 2019 loading.......
2723 2018-12-12 18:58:44 you don't heat homes with gas and fewer and fewer rely on oil.....
2724 2018-12-12 18:58:38 CIVIL SOCIETY PLATFORM ON  OIL AND GAS(CSPOG)  IS READY TO LAUCH ITS REPORT ON THE TYPOLOGY AND NATURE OF CORRUPTION RISKS IN GHANA'S EXTRACTIVE SECTOR....Corruption is still alive...together we can fight it into victory @IOGIRC @moigovgh @PIACGhana @joyonlineghana @KosmosEnergy
2725 2018-12-12 18:58:37 And you have your head in the sand when it comes to accepting the fact that oil touches every part of the 21st century life that you enjoy. Tell me, what are you prepared to sacrifice to effect real change?
2726 2018-12-12 18:58:30 This man talking about some Full service when I only said Oil change. Leave the tires air filter and everything else alone. I just want an OIL CHANGE
2727 2018-12-12 18:58:18 all of my mutuals are either prostitutes in training, or bottles of olive oil (extra virgin) <3

2728 2018-12-12 18:58:17 Doing some work on the Oil Services Sector. Looking for a name or two to buy for my long term stock account. 

Some real carnage... Anybody have any suggestions?
2729 2018-12-12 18:58:05 I agree Joe, those should be Hydr.Oil shut-off valves for muzzle doors.
2730 2018-12-12 18:57:57 Same LASG is aware about oil bunkering going on in Lagos, but do you hear or read about it ? Nope. Your potbellied men are cashing out from the loopholes.
2731 2018-12-12 18:57:56 I'm srry forgive me Youre right the monopoly bust never happened The gov. didn't have to step in and break up standard oil because they had a stranglehold on the compilation It wasn't a free market back then and it isn't now You should study more before shooting your mouth off
2732 2018-12-12 18:57:55 @BCFMONEYMAN1   sit down in a hot jacuzzi with lavender bath oil to help calm and soothe the body let your girl massages the temple of your head to the bottom of your feet smoke a blunt and rub on her booty ... what else u need ??
2733 2018-12-12 18:57:51 Someone make me go to a fucking service station right now I've been putting off getting my oil changed and air put in my tires for so long
2734 2018-12-12 18:57:39 I think it helps a lot more people save their jobs and keep their homes, if they know who’s really helping them and promoting oil production to save those jobs.

However, this has nothing to do with the start of the thread. My objection to the blatant lie, by a liar.
2735 2018-12-12 18:57:30 But no instant tax take for government and no loads of cash for norty old school oil companies
2736 2018-12-12 18:57:24 so just stop, you're doing nothing with this, but helping probe my point and by doing so planting me further in my views.
2737 2018-12-12 18:57:23 Or...not just yet. Doing my head in. All I do is Oil stocks and this is a head fuck

2745 2018-12-12 18:56:44 tried cleaning the grill and shot hot oil directly onto my throat 
2746 2018-12-12 18:56:42 it's ok to hate the right, I don't care, but stop with the fear mongering. there is no bus coming to collect you and put you in shock therapy camps. they aren't taking your marriages. they aren't even talking about homosexuality.
2747 2018-12-12 18:56:30 Until the oil runs out it's a hot spot.
2748 2018-12-12 18:56:12 There is no reason for him to take money from oil executives.

2751 2018-12-12 18:55:59 Being based in Manchester, Manchester City could literally buy them with pocket change.

Manchester City cycling Team :D

(Joking aside, with Bahrain etc there is probably some more oil money out there looking for promoting, Emirates, Qatar)
2752 2018-12-12 18:55:56 Your a victim of SNP lies. The Scot GDP % Deficit is 7.9% before this budget the rest of the UK is 1.9% as a whole. Don’t say to me it’s the Oil (that includes geographical proportion of oil). Even with WM funding (I agreed declining). Scotland deficit is 3 times that of UK
2753 2018-12-12 18:55:53 2/ kann Genius Oil in Ruhe auf dem Gholan Öl fördern.
2754 2018-12-12 18:55:47 @tyler83anderson  Hey Oil looking pretty good maybe it's time for us to make that bet?
2755 2018-12-12 18:55:47 bahi dalda ghee daal lo . because both have vegetable oil.
2756 2018-12-12 18:55:37 Yes..she did that in 2014 a year before she took office..shame on her for creating the world wide oil crisis...
2757 2018-12-12 18:55:36 Let me help you. The #oil #industry is not the entirety of the #energy industry - it makes up only part of that. The oil industry also encompasses the #petrochemical industry. Keep it #specific, folks. Better to try more and know what we're talking about.
2758 2018-12-12 18:55:35 I disagree!! 71st and Jeffery is worse to me. Long lines and loiters up the ass. From loose squares to nic's of loud and don't forget the oil man
2759 2018-12-12 18:55:23 Yes but it is integral to Scottish independence forming the backbone of economic predicitions so it is relevant. Last referendum the oil price was a historic high of c$100.
2760 2018-12-12 18:55:21 Hang in there.  CBD oil maybe.
2761 2018-12-12 18:55:07 Got water stuck in my ear and some stupid website said to put warm olive oil in it so here i am lying on my side now waiting for water AND lukewarm olivio to drain out of my head and was meant to be at the pub by 7 fs
2762 2018-12-12 18:55:07 just cried about spilling oil on a tablecloth :) abitur what are you doing to me?
2763 2018-12-12 18:54:50 I finally cracked and have ordered a CBD oil. CANNOT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT.
2764 2018-12-12 18:54:48 IDS said.."Venezuela without the oil" that's sounds to me like a Tory party manifesto that Dunkin Doubnut will surely deliver if his hard Brixit comes about. .Venezuela has had illegal oil and trade embargo imposed on by US..IDS will make GB go bust without the help of embargo..
2765 2018-12-12 18:54:39 Does anyone have specific numbers on his donations taken from the oil & gas industry?

2768 2018-12-12 18:54:24 Could this be just oil they poured in my hair and they called it treatment 
2769 2018-12-12 18:54:22 Did I ever tell you about the time I slipped on a bottle of Omega 3 pills?
It wasn't too bad. 
I only received...
>_>
<_<
Super Fish Oil injuries!

2770 2018-12-12 18:54:22 Then why hasn't it happened yet? Put the onus on the oil company to provide state of the art resources to detect and react to spills.
2771 2018-12-12 18:54:13 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2772 2018-12-12 18:54:13 If you do not go to the (health food) store, purchase some of the flakes and sprinkle them on hot fresh popcorn drizzled with good olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt, you will never know the joy of the nutritional yeast flake. And for that I would be truly sorry.
2773 2018-12-12 18:54:05 Your 24 hour climate reality broadcast was more relevant than ever. The age of burning coal and oil must come to an end. It is no longer another the posterity. Our way of living is in danger. The threat is more imminent than ever.
2774 2018-12-12 18:53:56 You could do a natural one by applying 1/2 mashed avocado, 1 tsp virgin olive oil  & 1 tbsp mayo. Leave on 15 mins. Shampoo out.
2775 2018-12-12 18:53:44 This is the highest level of stupidity judging situation based on facial expression.
2776 2018-12-12 18:53:42 I mean... It's like vegetable oil. But inside Cabal machines and armor.
2777 2018-12-12 18:53:42 Annonce des premiers noms pour la #FDBLanderneau. Allez, quelques pronos : Mass Hysteria, New Order, Thiéfaine ou Lavilliers ou Miossec, Midnight Oil, The Stray Cats, Archive
2778 2018-12-12 18:53:42 u may use dalda ghee. because both are made of vegetable oil content
2779 2018-12-12 18:53:41 Or SA will scale back production at other fields.  Giving trump victory but still winning higher oil battle.  SA has to have $87 oil to balance budget.
2780 2018-12-12 18:53:40 If oil painting wasn’t literally toxic, I’d probably do oils like I do watercolors 
2781 2018-12-12 18:53:37 @FrederickCoMD Someones dumping their old oil from oil changes along a creek bed on S Renn Rd, right along the road, in the creek bed at a little bridge at 39.365118, -77.475115  , right before the Frederick Golf Club
2782 2018-12-12 18:53:35 Peppermint oil sounds like a great solution! Hope you feel better soon, Amber!  (And I'm doing just great, thank you for asking)
2783 2018-12-12 18:53:35 Salmon and caribou were here before oil and mining. will they still be here when oil is gone in 50 years? We need to develop but responsibly
2784 2018-12-12 18:53:34 Where's our  N1.1tillion customs remitted?
Buhari pocket N1. 3 trillion oil revenue from NNPC... Where is our taxpayers money?
Buhari and the forty thieves.
2785 2018-12-12 18:53:31 Name some, other than oil/solid minerals rich or totalitarian, which are doing as well, if not enduring national crisis of one sort or another.
2786 2018-12-12 18:53:22 I am not against them either. I love putting lavender oil in a diffuser to make my house smell good! Just not using them to treat illnesses.
2787 2018-12-12 18:53:12 have u ever wiped your eyes while the green oil were on your fingers 
2788 2018-12-12 18:53:11 Thanks! I will have to take a look at what capsules they offer. I'm not 100% sure I'd be able to give her oil/liquid on top of her antibiotic.
2789 2018-12-12 18:53:06 Baby oil does the damn things! 
2790 2018-12-12 18:53:02 Oils are NOT moisturizers.
Shea Butter is NOT a moisturizer.

To keep your skin moisturized during this dry season, add a few drops of Vegetable Glycerin or Grapeseed/Monoi Oil to your moisturizing lotion (especially if it’s a lightweight lotion).
2791 2018-12-12 18:52:58 Groove at the ManQave oil to be served
2792 2018-12-12 18:52:52 @VictoriasSecret Not to mention the emotional stress it caused me thinking the issue was because of miscarriage. I even talked to my doctor about this strange issue. There is not a warning on the bras that say warning contains oil or could leak.
2793 2018-12-12 18:52:49 Japan only attacked us out of necessity due to the oil embargo, but it's not like the pre-internet teenagers who fought in the war were intimately aware of this aspect of global geopolitics.
2794 2018-12-12 18:52:49 They're still registered with Elections Canada, which means they've kept their paperwork up to date.
2795 2018-12-12 18:52:47 YEMENI GOVERNMENT AND HUTHI DELEGATIONS AGREE TO RESUME EXPORT OF OIL AND GAS

2797 2018-12-12 18:52:38 Was gonna change the oil on the TDI today, but apparently no stores carry the oil and filter it takes, so had to order them on Amazon.
2798 2018-12-12 18:52:37 monet hair and beauty

2799 2018-12-12 18:52:35 Often politicians can be out of touch. I don't believe Quebecers believe Canadian oil is a bad thing.
2800 2018-12-12 18:52:29 You are peddling snake oil here. I suspect you know it as well.
2801 2018-12-12 18:52:12 Uno your tired when you go to drink the massage oil instead of your glass of water 
2802 2018-12-12 18:52:10 Sounds like you only love governments that support your oil investments. Not very patriotic.
2803 2018-12-12 18:52:07 I have earned 300 xtra rewards from indian oil but sadly say to no any information/updates at any indian oil petrol pumps for how to redeem extra rewards points. So kindly educate to every iocl petrol pumps employee for better running this campaign. @xtrarewards @IndianOilcl ok..
2804 2018-12-12 18:51:57 Any civilian dying is a shame but it's a fact that the middle East has been fighting each other for hundreds if not thousands of years long before oil.
2805 2018-12-12 18:51:46 I was going to get baking oil but it’s sold out 
2806 2018-12-12 18:51:46 @VictoriasSecret While looking up my problem online I couldn’t find anything about oil leaking from boobs but I found out that the brand of bra I wear has oil inside and can leak!!!!
2807 2018-12-12 18:51:42 Fossil fuels are awesome for society:a huge net positive esp for poor people who get cheap heat/cooling, transportation and cheaper goods. 

I didn't say "all humans". Some will die in a crash on the freeway or in an accident on an oil well. You seem incapable of assessing macro.
2808 2018-12-12 18:51:42 It would be cheaper to dig a border ditch and fill it with oil
2809 2018-12-12 18:51:37 when jiffy lube said my car was so fucked up they couldn’t do an oil change, i felt that....
2810 2018-12-12 18:51:31 Thank you, it’s all the avocado oil
2811 2018-12-12 18:51:26 @anandmahindra I'm a die hard fan of @jawamotorcycles , However m riding #royalenfield since last five years, bought it in installments, I can not afford new @jawamotorcycles can I get its front lamp assembly and oil tank so that I can make my bike look like #Jawa
2812 2018-12-12 18:51:22 Anybody happen to tell you that Trump has made America "Energy Independent"? We're the #1 Oil and Natural Gas producer in The World? Fuel prices in Liberal States will remain high due to Democrat Policies and over-taxed fuel.
2813 2018-12-12 18:51:15 Olive oil vs .....
2814 2018-12-12 18:51:13 @VictoriasSecret I went to the bathroom and my whole bra was soaked with oil so I thought my boobs were leaking oil and I must be having another miscarriage. In 2014 I had oil only on one side and it had followed a miscarriage so I though this was happening again.
2815 2018-12-12 18:51:05 Requiring upstream and downstream emissions to be calculated, nothing bombardier or Saudi oil is required to do.  Neither was the cement plant in Quebec, it faced zero NEB evaluations. Or the impact of TMX tankers on the west coast oceans, nothing the coal freighters had to do
2816 2018-12-12 18:50:56 Yemen warring parties agree to resume oil and gas exports - delegates from both sides via @Reuters
2817 2018-12-12 18:50:44 Oh, there's definitely some hedging & strong signaling going on here. It's not simply the shared oil field; one Kuwait official described the Saudi approach in those negotiations as very political, infringing on issues of sovereignty, which harmed chance for an agreement.
2818 2018-12-12 18:50:29 @VictoriasSecret I do not like to complain about things but this situation really upset me. During my Christmas party someone said I spilled something on my shirt and when I looked down it looked like an oil stain.
2819 2018-12-12 18:50:18 TODAY: In 1980, American oil tycoon Armand Hammer pays $5 million—the highest ever for a manuscript at that time—for the Leicester Codex containing writings by Leonardo da Vinci.
2820 2018-12-12 18:50:15 Well just like your overlord Trudope you don’t have a clue how anyone outside your little dictatorship feels about anything. The price of oil was in the dump because of the Trudope liberal policy’s.
2821 2018-12-12 18:50:09 "How do I know that what I'm eating is actually working?"

Measure

Lab tests are the best method

If you're not testing more often than getting an oil change

You're being irresponsible with your body
2822 2018-12-12 18:50:07 Just need to see that Oil flowing now... GL
2823 2018-12-12 18:49:40 Hospice doctor has told his 80+ year old patient to find cannabis oil imediatly. She contacted a local club. The Doctor has doubled all her opiates without taking into account cannabinoids increase opiate availability. Luckily we have a cannabis triage on staff to avoid disaster!
2824 2018-12-12 18:49:39 Prime Minister Selfie doesn't want to use his constitutional authority to allow the Energy East pipeline to take Western Canadian oil to refineries on the East Coast. Quebec holding the country hostage again. But millions of litres of raw sewage in the St. Lawrence is okay.
2825 2018-12-12 18:49:37 Just like you said before, I agree with those things as general statements. But we need to go beyond that. 

When you say smaller government, what do you mean? Because I agree that we should spend less on military engagements, as well as stop subsidizing companies, like oil
2826 2018-12-12 18:49:35 People are distancing themselves from saudi and it’s a good thing. Oil won’t last forever
2827 2018-12-12 18:49:28 @K_E_Cl I still have that perfume you got me for my 16th birthday and I put some in my oil diffuser for my car lol. I miss you
2828 2018-12-12 18:49:23 "I bought your land and am turning it  into an oil resort." I'm pretty sure that's a quote from an actual Hallmark movie.
2829 2018-12-12 18:49:23 And I'm good at it 
Esp. When I see carrot oil I massage with motion
2830 2018-12-12 18:49:04 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。

2835 2018-12-12 18:48:46 Where did the PM suggest this? Please supply a link evidencing it. Furthermore, Saudi oil is mostly going to Irving, so are you suggesting that Irving be told where to buy its feedstock?
2836 2018-12-12 18:48:40 My mom just asked if I wanted her to do that thing w the green oil n the quarter to my back fuuuuck no
2837 2018-12-12 18:48:37 Maybe limit the military's mission. Stay out of regional conflicts. Perform less international corporate security. Care less about middle East oil. Generally try to find ways the military doesn't need to be involved.
2838 2018-12-12 18:48:32 Oil.
2839 2018-12-12 18:48:25 Getting an oil change and the parents Christmas presents done :) shopping for babe on Friday and then everyone has their stuff :) I love this time of year 
2840 2018-12-12 18:48:22  My dog does too. Depending on how muddy the puddle looks I let her or pull her away. Oil stains are a no no.
2841 2018-12-12 18:48:15 Particularly the "Alcohol Inc Whisky" which totalled 39.3% of the entire UK. I do wonder if these oil+petroleum+North Sea figures (mostly 97.1%) was the reason why they moved the boundary line in the North Sea that same year?
2842 2018-12-12 18:48:10 something about walking Washington Ave with a 7-11 coffee in this weather reminds me of a time that i don’t need to recall.

2855 2018-12-12 18:46:40 I'm super happy I got my Wake & Bake Oil from @beautybakerie when I did cuz I was trying to order another one for my mom and they're sold ouuuut
2856 2018-12-12 18:46:39 @POTUS does this make sense: we buy oil from other countries and sell ours to china. Why don't we use our own resources?? it's Cheaper
2857 2018-12-12 18:46:37 Trump's stance on the environment:  We're giving this country over to the developers & polluters, including all public lands and coastal waters, for free.  Get over it suckers, u lost the election, so choke on coal dust, drink chemical spills, and admire the oil rig view.
2858 2018-12-12 18:46:23 In all seriousness tho, if you can get some mint oil, or menthol oil, rub it on your temples. It helps.
2859 2018-12-12 18:46:20 Trump's stance on the environment:  We're giving this country over to the developers & polluters, including all public lands and coastal waters, for free.  Get over it suckers, u lost the election, so choke on coal dust, drink chemical spills, and admire the oil rig view.
2860 2018-12-12 18:46:17 Just saw this chick who frontal was due for an oil change.
2861 2018-12-12 18:46:14 I just want a massage... with oil.... with a side of icecream
2862 2018-12-12 18:46:07 Oh I see, so let's let the hundreds probably thousands of unemployed in the West fend for themselves? Put 'em on welfare as our brilliant PM suggested? Build the damn pipelines and stop using Saudi oil. #pipelines #Alberta
2863 2018-12-12 18:45:39 why do you keep avoiding my question though. what legislation has the right introduced that takes gay rights?

2866 2018-12-12 18:45:35 No disagreements there but pollution is global issue Nordic countries might use a lot of renewable Tesla but they sell oil to other countries to pollute. So no ine is innocent here.
2867 2018-12-12 18:45:30 COSMOPOLITAN: Often use a massage oil.
2868 2018-12-12 18:45:25 Some one is about to get the wonder bread bag & olive oil treatment!
2869 2018-12-12 18:45:22 Anyone wanna buy me oil pastels so I can make some art with my photos
2870 2018-12-12 18:45:20 Good article but unfortunately it doesn’t even scratch the surface. 
*Another big one is the pipeline debacle. 
*Decimated our largest resource so now we buy Saudi oil. 
*Imposed carbon tax on Canadians to save the world from global warming - even though we  are carbon neutral
2871 2018-12-12 18:44:58 And some environmental and First Nations groups are being bankrolled by powerful American interests that want to keep Canadian oil limited to the American market. Who's drinking the koolaid? You need to expand your research.
2872 2018-12-12 18:44:58 Trump's stance on the environment:  We're giving this planet over to the developers & polluters, including all public lands and coastal waters, for free.  Get over it suckers, u lost the election, so choke on coal dust, drink chemical spills, and admire the oil rig view.

2878 2018-12-12 18:44:33 Fentanyl comes mostly from China. The migrants “walking” up to our borders are fully vetted and holding Children, not drugs doofus. The drugs are in trucks, cooking oil barrels, shipping containers of household goods and tunnels. Seriously, listen to some other news.
2879 2018-12-12 18:44:24 It's such a pity this is a practice all over now , even with contractors - workers on @AlikoDangote oil refinery project going on @ idasho /Eleko coastal line .. I wonder where we are heading in this country.

2884 2018-12-12 18:43:58 @dawisu we celebrate roads which other countries built in the 90s in this contemporary time. Oga! I know you travel to UK and USA 24/7.. to be sincere to yourself. Don't you think we as oil producing country is beyond such level of displaying roads as major projects ..Na wa

2888 2018-12-12 18:43:11 No lie, essential oil drops are better than all of these things
2889 2018-12-12 18:43:02 I’m thinking this dude would benefit from a VO5 hot oil treatment.
2890 2018-12-12 18:42:55 I called a shop to ask questions about their oil changes, and when I asked if they took cash or card, the guy was like “we take all kinds of payments, even like souls or blood, maybe pizza” bruh, I just met the loml 
2891 2018-12-12 18:42:50 god bless coconut oil 
2892 2018-12-12 18:42:43 Who expects roads, schools, hospitals? Who's benefitted from 1970s Lougheed gov investment that created the oil sand industry that keeps AB & Cda's tax load so light

If Kenney's juvenile free market ideology, where wd AB, Cda or Kenney, be now?

2893 2018-12-12 18:42:43 Mf talking bout bout my expired inspection sticker i clearly said oil change. I know my shit out it’s in front of me

2895 2018-12-12 18:42:07 Baba ..Oil dy your head
2896 2018-12-12 18:42:00 ...a significant portion of US economy has become addicted to both oil&gas industries & military-industrial complex (as 'bread & butter') - will the GreenNewDeal include any detoxing & offboarding strategies for those companies/industries and trades trapped in that vicious cycle?
2897 2018-12-12 18:41:59 Air Canada doesn’t support Canadian energy?
Only foreign oil good enough for them?
Guess that’s why they charge double over Westjet.
Westjet is much better anyway.
2898 2018-12-12 18:41:50 Bottom line remains #Tripolitania has the control of all the money/income from the sales of oil/gas/remains in control of all the economic factors.  Yes, individual citizens, Tripoli, other cities, suffer but it is up to you to overcome Tripoli.

2900 2018-12-12 18:41:16 They are protesting a tax on fuel for the cars not the cost of oil.  This extra revenue from these taxes would go to the French government not some third world government.
2901 2018-12-12 18:41:07 Is preparing a big boiling cauldron of oil for @anncyinq
2902 2018-12-12 18:41:05 Also because oil from tar sands is pretty much the worst oil there is.
2903 2018-12-12 18:40:54 Sanctions are on individuals, not the entire country. Their oil production is falling on it's own because they do a terrible job at it.
2904 2018-12-12 18:40:53 @TheFreddyD yo cat, don’t leave...I’m in the oil and gas...and I listens to ya cats on the radio when I head out to the rigs #blackgold
2905 2018-12-12 18:40:45 I put tea tree oil on my nose bc breakouts and now my face burns and my eyes are watering but BEAUTY IS PAIN 
2906 2018-12-12 18:40:40 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
2907 2018-12-12 18:40:39 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2908 2018-12-12 18:40:38 I don't believe you. No one in their right mind does. We don't want big fat totalitarian government dictating to business or people in general. You created the oil crisis deliberately and we know it. SMH. Sheeeesh.
2909 2018-12-12 18:40:37 ..animals, ppl starving, a once robust middle class driven to prostitution, no gas in a country w/ more oil than Saudi Arabia, no toilet paper, incalculably high inflation, etc. Socialism kills. Always has, always will. To not know that is ignorance.
2910 2018-12-12 18:40:25 Coconut oil touches my soul in a different way baaabbbbyyy

2912 2018-12-12 18:40:18 So what did Obama have to do with It? The Republican Congress created and passed the bill based on increased oil production that Obama opposed. He did nothing, yet you give him credit.
2913 2018-12-12 18:40:18 Which essential oil is best to get people to stop talking to you, and where can i get some.
2914 2018-12-12 18:40:06 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
2915 2018-12-12 18:39:57 For real. My BFF is posh. Like oil paintings of her family posh and it’s a whole other fucking world.
2916 2018-12-12 18:39:57 Theresa may and a “strong and stable government” are like oil and water
I hope she’s thrown out in the tory mps’ ballot
2917 2018-12-12 18:39:57 That's why lower income countries use it. From their perspective, it's extremely valuable. 

So, again, I'm talking about comparative advantages. US natural gas exports decrease the number of coal plants in Asia. US oil lowers transportation costs helping low income countries.
2918 2018-12-12 18:39:52 Petroleum n gas oil production will help Afghanistan much easier for traders to fuel up .
2919 2018-12-12 18:39:52 "We don't know" Myth is part of problem. The mechanisms of how drugs "work" isn't rocket science... brain damage, blunting, chemical lobotomy, spellbinding. Ppl r conned & coerced by snake oil salesmen who lie 2 them bc theyr not held accountable 4 social destruction they cause.

2922 2018-12-12 18:39:44 Today I had the best twists ever! I washed it on Monday, applied leave-in conditioner and oil then did chunky twists to allow it to dry. Then jana afternoon I did flat twists (I applied Auntie Jackies Curling Custard), and bomoad them today around noon. Really defined hair!
2923 2018-12-12 18:39:44 though I ask again, and I'm still waiting, what rights have they taken? I don't give a shit about rhetoric, I want actual legislation that take rights.
2924 2018-12-12 18:39:39 Which essential oil will stop my co worker from being a nuisance and from bringing bad energy into this office?
2925 2018-12-12 18:39:38 Yeah i usually put castor oil when i do a twist out
2926 2018-12-12 18:39:38 Come get cheaper, ethical oil from us in Canada. :3
2927 2018-12-12 18:39:38 Fungible....I meant green energy to buy much less oil
2928 2018-12-12 18:39:37 Fences and walls work.its an undeniable fact.
If they didnt, nobody would spend money on them and illegal aliens all over the country wouldn't have jobs building them.
2929 2018-12-12 18:39:34 By the power vested in me, the secret to long healthy hair is coconut milk and olive oil
2930 2018-12-12 18:39:29 I need my hair done, nails done, eyebrows done and an oil change. 
2931 2018-12-12 18:39:27 The process that creates oil is generally the same in most areas, although there may be different types of plant and animal debris that falls to the ocean floor and slightly different conditions
2932 2018-12-12 18:39:25 God will use what you have to solve your problem. Moses had a staff by the Red Sea; Widow of Zarephath an handful of meal and little oil; David had a sling and stone... #Jesusway @lutosinGBELA @olarinde_ayoade @Gidi_Traffic @pastorpoju @drmikemurdock

It tastes unbelievably good
2936 2018-12-12 18:39:04 They may not be cute but they are hilarious to watch.
2937 2018-12-12 18:38:57 Hmm how many billions subsidize the oil and gas industry in the US?
2938 2018-12-12 18:38:46 Sustainable palm oil is a starting point, firstly why is this taking so long to achieve, and secondly what is Unilver doing actively to enforce sustainability?
2939 2018-12-12 18:38:24 Answer: around 3/4 of all oil consumption is for transportation. Next question for you to get emotional about: how many automakers will still be producing internal combustion engines ten years from now?

2941 2018-12-12 18:38:19 Why is Google in DC answering to accusations on “biased” search algorithms? They should be addressing questions about US antitrust laws. They’re the Standard Oil Co. of the digital age...
2942 2018-12-12 18:38:10 Go get educated before you talk crap.Scotland has tons of oil.
2943 2018-12-12 18:38:08 Look, I don't need a bunch of quotes from Confederates & plantation owners to know what the Confederacy & Civil War were about--I just need to gaze longingly on an oil painting of a noble Confederate warrior & engage in fantasy role play.
2944 2018-12-12 18:38:05 North Sea oil contributes about 0.2% to the national UK budget (UK budget is £842 billion) at around £1.9 billion/year.

Completely negligible at this point.
2945 2018-12-12 18:37:51 Show me someone who thinks raccoons are cute and I'll show you someone who doesn't live near them and/or doesn't own a garden.
2946 2018-12-12 18:37:46 So those are being pan fried with (preboiled) sprouts and sage (bit oil seasoning etc)

I’ve also put them in a nut roast. I’m 80% veggie now and half of that vegan.

2947 2018-12-12 18:37:46 1) Collusion is a common word for the non-criminal but potentially problematic action that was being proposed and 2) @MLA_Karen was referring to the oil co’s colluding, not @jkenney. #ableg
2948 2018-12-12 18:37:36 oh okay like an oil pastel study
2949 2018-12-12 18:37:27 Until companies like yours come clean about sourcing of palm oil and are seen to be actively enforcing standards, many people will be sceptical that you are just hiding behind banners. I’m sure tbe Mr Kipling products of my youth did not contain palm oil, why do they need to now?
2950 2018-12-12 18:37:21 Funny thing is people  think Flower / Oil  with High THC is the best / better not true .

2953 2018-12-12 18:36:57 Ok. They did 3 timings. December, January and March. December had 43% reduction in larvae, January 55% reduction. March was too late as rape had gone into stem elongation. No yield or oil reduction from being defoliated . Now all I need are some   ! Will write this up soon.
2954 2018-12-12 18:36:56 I need some beard oil ahaha
2955 2018-12-12 18:36:44 I need this essential oil we use in the diffusers at work.

It's pretty useless but it does smell nice.
Tastes like ass mind
2957 2018-12-12 18:36:35 Or an oil rig accident honestly
2958 2018-12-12 18:36:30 It must be the tariffs and the trade war whenever the indices are up or down!  HA!!  LOL!  Point here is:  #GOLD and #Oil UP!!  In unrelated news the DOW is up 430 points.  So if you are a buy the dip sort give it a day or 2! Fun times friends!
2959 2018-12-12 18:36:13 So I dropped my coconut oil the other day and the jar broke right. So my dumb ass goes to use the coconut oil on my face just now to get this makeup off and why do I end up cutting my face everywhere 
2960 2018-12-12 18:36:13 Reform would affect the illegal activities how? Make them legal? Allow unlimited numbers of people to come? No matter what reform is taken there will always be a line and millions willing to jump that line. False notion reform will end illegal immigration
2961 2018-12-12 18:36:11 If she adds oil to fire sure we all trying to eradicate the darkness around us .....of course Times of India has added petrol to our fire lot more to witness ....
2962 2018-12-12 18:36:04 True. But it doesn't damage your lungs when used. Also, oil is far too valuable to burn moving cars.

2965 2018-12-12 18:35:56 @ElvisDuranShow You said something on your show today about the legalization of marijuana. For those suffering with issues from accidents, surgeries or other issues with dwarfism it is a miracle to have it. CBD oil is great and really helps out a lot. Love your show.
2966 2018-12-12 18:35:50 Tomorrow I get to play my aasimar rogue/barbarian (aaaaaaaaa-there's the silvery oil that turns everything to metal and we may have put a wizard-bomb (that is: a wizard. Who might be turned into a bomb in the process of this) into the portal it's all spilling out of and probably
2967 2018-12-12 18:35:49 Like that time they bought a pipeline or helped fund expansion of the oil sands? Those monsters 
2968 2018-12-12 18:35:40 Those who say coconut oil is “just as good as butter” in relation to anything are wrong. 

Typically the same people who suggest it’s better than <insert literally anything here>. 

It’s good, but it’s no bacon #baconisgoodwithanything #bacon
2969 2018-12-12 18:35:39 Got an oil change after being overdue for over a month so I guess I can say I am productive today.
2970 2018-12-12 18:35:29 Their plan was to use the oil and gas in Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon to finance thier jihadists movements.That is the complete silence of the ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists.
2971 2018-12-12 18:35:21 i need an oil heiresss/heir in my life
2972 2018-12-12 18:35:04 Nigeria’s just basically screwing over our future generation even more. Why issue more Eurobonds when Naira’s weaker, oil is volatile, no tangible source of $ ?

2975 2018-12-12 18:34:47 You are stupid because work has not slowed down in chemical plants.  I get emails all the time about them hiring and am very good friends with guys who run the projects.  They still grow and make money with cheap oil.

I've sliced my finger open, mandolined a finger, took the skin off my little finger on a chargrill, bruised the back of my hand and splashed hot oil up my arm 
2980 2018-12-12 18:33:59 Am I late to this “You got that Oil” phrase? I’ve been seeing it a lot today and I’d never heard it before.
2981 2018-12-12 18:33:58 Cbd oil rlly b hittin my brain
2982 2018-12-12 18:33:47 Over 190 miles covered so far today. It has consisted of a slow puncture  (needing topped up every 30-40miles or so), an increasingly rattley heat-shield, a crunching spring and a blown bulb. Oh and at least a litre of oil. Still another 60 or so miles to go. How's your day?
2983 2018-12-12 18:33:39 Why do you people want a human-sized portion of delicious food made with care rather than a mountain of salt and soybean oil on a plate? Clearly you are all just pretentious.

2993 2018-12-12 18:32:43 To my way of thinking...the bacteria not only has to eat the OIL SPILL...it has to then FLOAT to the surface and become harvestable For recycling of both the oil and the biomass

2994 2018-12-12 18:32:21 Thank you for responding. You say that you buy “limited palm oil” but every Mr Kipling product I looked at in my local supermarket contains palm oil.  So please can you post a list of your products which contain palm and which don’t contain palm for comparison purposes.
2995 2018-12-12 18:32:05 Don’t forget Tierny Connolly is returning for Christmas with oil money after a stint in desert the boom is back
2996 2018-12-12 18:32:04 "He was selling snake oil and the label on that bottle of snake oil was 'change'" is extremely @AccidentalP
2997 2018-12-12 18:32:00 Try hemp oil drops.
2998 2018-12-12 18:31:55 Services will be performed including oil change, valve adjustment, oil filter check and adjustment, air filter service, and final drive service. Spark plugs, cables, and throttle body will also undergo routine exams. *valid at the selling dealership and authorized dealers (pt. 2)
2999 2018-12-12 18:31:48 The struggle for curly hair! I also add a little black castro oil to my hair, my girl Khina put me on that, and my curls look and feel soft and shiny! Those products definitely will get you the hydration you’re looking for tho!!
3000 2018-12-12 18:31:46 I tell the Truth about The Sun, the Weather, Volcanoes, Earthquakes, Planetary Orbital Angular Momentum & the Oil and War deception economy. LOW WAGES sound soooooo good to me.
3001 2018-12-12 18:31:32 Q should leave.   They take more than they give.   And their Premier does not want Alberta oil.   I want Alberta oil and so do many others.  All politicians seem to be the same with the exception of Ford and Trump.
3002 2018-12-12 18:31:26 My son in 3rd grade can do this math. Big oil has more money, and spends more money influencing the public and politicians. The difference is staggering. If you're going to decry money being used in this space you're taking issue with the wrong people.
3003 2018-12-12 18:31:26 for money because they fear innovation.  Yep, natural gas is less harmful than heavy oil and far less than coal.  But it's still old school, like you.  And like Trump.  The US also dominates the world in murders. Nothing to write home about there, either.

3016 2018-12-12 18:30:16 But didn't you just acknowledge it doesn't come from oil companies but from the consumer (tax paying public)
3017 2018-12-12 18:30:01 Wow 60+ foot backhand sauce on the tape while mcd flying down wing. That’s plain old filthy sauce Leon!!! Maybe one of best passes you’ll see all year. BTW Oil are rolling
3018 2018-12-12 18:29:52 “Managed” no deal is a thing  made up by snake oil salesmen. And you’ll find out if it’s what people had in mind if you let them vote on it.
3019 2018-12-12 18:29:31 Albertans have erroneously convinced themselves that everyone in Canada lives off "their" oil. Alberta energy contributes about 2% to the national GDP. Get over it. #cdnpoli #boycottQuebec
3020 2018-12-12 18:29:23 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
3021 2018-12-12 18:29:21 waw pakagat naman tetestingin ko kung oil base yung liptint
3022 2018-12-12 18:29:08 Canada does not import Saudi oil. Private corporations do.
3023 2018-12-12 18:28:58 What’s this? Kale pache. Hmm. People in Russia consume more and more palm oil, they will soon begin to climb palm trees. Probably, such eaters will like this too.
3024 2018-12-12 18:28:56 SUCH good news!  But it is not over yet. Keep pushing, Greenpeace and WELL DONE so far! Get rid of palm oil ... it is in so many of our food products. Did you know that it is in Christmas puddings and mince pies? BAD news at this time of the year!
3025 2018-12-12 18:28:55 If OPEC and Russia cut anywhere near 1.0Mb/d and winter demand is strong – up 2Mb/d from the fall data, then crude oil can start to lift back over US$60 during Q/1/19.
3026 2018-12-12 18:28:52 Make it or break it time #oil #cl_f
3027 2018-12-12 18:28:49 What is big oil hiding from us?!
3028 2018-12-12 18:28:45 The amount of money received in subsidies in single years by big oil dwarfs entire 'big green' company budgets. SolarCity's market cap is $4.98B. That's less than one sixth the amount oil companies get from the Ethanol Excise tax credit.
3029 2018-12-12 18:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3030 2018-12-12 18:28:26 I do not believe so.

For one, allies should meet a higher standard - which is why I think the US should sever military ties with Saudi Arabia, despite our strategic interest in their oil.

The US & UK allied w/USSR during WWII despite their evil because of existential threat.
3031 2018-12-12 18:28:19 So far I've just been using this vape I got at Joe's but it's not very economical. I ordered actual oil to use sublingually from cbdMD -- it's being shipped rn but they have really good reviews + are super affordable!!
3032 2018-12-12 18:28:17 sat down to play my guitar 2 hours ago.... didn't like the finish on the neck so now I'm sanding it off and I'm gonna put some teak oil on it later in the week. Will post pics.
3033 2018-12-12 18:28:10 I try not to judge but TOMATOES!!!!! They’re delicious and look...sliced tomatoes with Greek feta/olives/oregano/olive oil and salt.  Bread for dipping. Followed by a tasty merlot. I mean come on!
3034 2018-12-12 18:28:04 Oh that looks great - yes please, let's have that!

I love footnote D, to really drive home that you can't have a cafe in an oil refinery. =D
3035 2018-12-12 18:28:02 I put too much coconut oil in my hair 
3036 2018-12-12 18:28:00 The fact is, no matter what type of reform is passed, not every single person would be admitted, just like now. Illegal immigration, human trafficking, smuggling, general illegal activity would not end or be affected in any significant way.
3037 2018-12-12 18:27:57 WTI crude oil bottomed on November 28th at US$49.41/b (down from a high of US$76.90 in early October) and has held a trading range of US$50-54 over the last while since that low.

3042 2018-12-12 18:27:42 How do you even spray oil? What kind of oil comes in a spray bottle?
3043 2018-12-12 18:27:29 Public perception of you Mr. Gove is, that, you are more slippery than a barrel full of eels in baby oil.... you have no public respect.
3044 2018-12-12 18:27:22 Now imagine, despite the state being highly dependent on oil. The state petroleum company was underinvested in. That it could no longer keep up with production. The bias was only toward social spending disregarding economic spending.
3045 2018-12-12 18:27:20 well TIL that oil changes apparently take over an hour and a half. someone save me, ive been at this fucking dealership since 1
3046 2018-12-12 18:27:03 Try peanut oil.
3047 2018-12-12 18:27:03 Yeah honestly, when you shoot it it's the stickiness of the oil clutching onto your esophagus that kills you more than the spice itself. Mistakes were made, to say the least!
3048 2018-12-12 18:27:00 Sugar, solid coconut oil, and a little food flavouring like peppermint or bubble gum.

3055 2018-12-12 18:26:23 People don’t defend Tabacco companies, pharmaceutical corps, the oil industry, McDonald’s or Walmart with this kind of passion. People truly believe in the ideology of social media and technology. It’s a world belief, the consumers are the cult. They would trade everything for it

3061 2018-12-12 18:25:47 I mean you should just buy 3 gallons of olive oil
3062 2018-12-12 18:25:45 It’s too late to avoid global recession. Here in Canada, with the oil price down and the downturn of automobile sectors, it’s not looking good at all.

3067 2018-12-12 18:25:25 China’s longterm thinking is what’s needed here. Oil profits in the short run could take us all down.
3068 2018-12-12 18:25:16 Not knocking the oil industry. It is a polluting and dying industry. I was knocking your original comment. No matter who we elect, they will fly all over the world in private jets. Country over party. Im not saying I disagree with your view on oil independence.

3071 2018-12-12 18:24:55 The high oil revenues which were mismanaged tried to musk the underlying economic inefficiencies of the regime. 

They had no sustainability in mind. They thought oil could continue on a high trajectory. As a result they couldn't well invest the surplus revenues.
3072 2018-12-12 18:24:55 I'd like to see him say this to an immigration officer and hear how it works out.
3073 2018-12-12 18:24:50 US want to give more economic opportunties to KRG and they dont want them to be more involved with the Russian oil companies.
3074 2018-12-12 18:24:50 Ok girl you need to try the Clinique moisture surge moisturizer! It’s AMAZINGGGG. I got this peach & lily glass skin serum and I think that’s what is making my skin irritated. But I’ve also been using the honest magic oil or whatever and that’s amazing as well.
3075 2018-12-12 18:24:50 Having delicious oil drenched paranthe everyday isn’t gonna help my hibernating abs. But who’d tell that to my mother...
3076 2018-12-12 18:24:50 It is and should be built. Everify and entry/ exit tracking should be passed, stand alone bills.
This altar of comprehensive immigration reform and the grand deal, that will never happen, keeps common sense measures the ppl support from being passed.
3077 2018-12-12 18:24:39 Energy East is about supplying our own CANADIAN oil to Eastern Canada instead of importing foreign oil.

Yes some exports too but it provides energy security to all of Canada.

If you like sending Canadian $$ overseas without return that's fair but allow AB to export.

3089 2018-12-12 18:23:41 So glad you wanted this discussion. The multiplier necessary to compare the money differential between the two sides requires multiple zeros and is in favor of big oil.

3101 2018-12-12 18:22:31 So this article tracks $556M in grants.

Oil companies have donated at least this amount collectively to political campaigns *on the books* over the last 5 years. This doesn't count lobbying efforts. And the top six oil Giants just recently completed a Q with $51.5B in profit.
3102 2018-12-12 18:22:27 I'd not call me a specialist, I've more experience with futures of currencies and monetary policy. But oil market is facing many changes: the necessary change in our sources of energy, economic  growth in mega nations, the discovery of reserves here, shale oil in US and Canada.

3111 2018-12-12 18:21:38 The economic regime was bound to come down at some point. & İt had to take a slump in oil prices to reveal that. Social indicators were impressive. But as long as the structure of the economy was not dealt with. They were on an unsustainable trajectory.

But better it died fairly swiftly, than the slow death that ingesting oil pollution would have given it, James. 
Makes you wonder where that oil has come from too, doesn’t it.
3130 2018-12-12 18:19:41 We don’t need their oil and they have little else to offer. Pull out.!
3131 2018-12-12 18:19:17 LTO with oil, vinegar salt and pepper! That’s exactly what I had for lunch #delizioso
3132 2018-12-12 18:19:04 Peddle your snake oil elsewhere spineless DC!!
3133 2018-12-12 18:18:55 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

3136 2018-12-12 18:18:50 Dude her hair feels like a weave, “PUT SOME COCONUT OIL ON THAT SHIT  “
3137 2018-12-12 18:18:39 US needs the heavy WCS to blend with the light shale oil. Very smart of Canada to call this bluff.
3138 2018-12-12 18:18:38 Who in Texas does not work in oil/energy related field. It can be anyone from the executives to the engineers and geologists, to the roughnecks, to the equipment suppliers, the refinery workers, the truck drivers, to the clerical workers.

3140 2018-12-12 18:18:13 2/ I don’t mind anyone backing Indy, but please stop kidding the nats are progressive with the constant dirge of Scottish exceptionalism and grievance. With a record deficit (see ur own Growth Comm), you would have turbo austerity. Lucky we’ve got those secret oil fields, eh? 
3141 2018-12-12 18:18:10 Sorry to barge in, I had my thyroid removed last and my scar is barely visable now. A lot of people use bio oil when its healed enough. Hope you're feeling well.
3142 2018-12-12 18:17:57 my bumper fell off yesterday and as soon as i turn my car on today, my oil change light comes on...i’m pissed
3143 2018-12-12 18:17:40 Wait which green one? The original? I have a green one but its castor oil
3144 2018-12-12 18:17:38 "How often do you take care of your car? Gas, oil change, cleaning it out etc. You need to do that with everything you own, including your phone" People are ignorant & lazy & I would love to just watch them all struggle & burn but somehow it's MY fault your shit doesn't work? nty

3148 2018-12-12 18:17:29 Interesting point.  I wonder if we have an oil trap on our drying system.  The design is quite similar.  
3149 2018-12-12 18:17:23 Nobody said they hated you so chill out, Courtney. Aside, your belief in “small gov” is an idea that is opened for criticism like anything else. Also, conservatives only want small gov until it’s time to regulate bodies, rig elections and sexualities, and bomb countries for oil.

3152 2018-12-12 18:17:19 Like what? 

Free schools? We tried copying Sweden's example there and they didn't make a good showing.

Health? Even worse waiting times and lack of funding than us when it comes to Sweden. Norway has oil and Denmark's ranking has fallen.

The Nordic model only works w/ Nordics.
3153 2018-12-12 18:17:13 I think the main ingredient in the serums is rosehip oil. It’s $10 at the health store vs $45
3154 2018-12-12 18:17:08 A woman behind me at the grocery was buying only a bottle of canola oil. 



I really wanted to let her know how dangerous that oil is!  Aged looking skin, no surprise. 

Sad.  People are still buying and consuming this utter garbage.
3155 2018-12-12 18:17:05 Until Trump acknowledges that the Saudi Prince ordered the execution of a journalist - what is the point? Oil wins over people according to Trump #ImpeachTrump
3156 2018-12-12 18:17:01 Then don't knock the oil industry. Knock your government that fly all over the world in private jets and ship in billions of barrels of oil across the ocean from Saudi Arabia. A government that refuses to build a pipeline that would dramatically cut shipping methods that pollute
3157 2018-12-12 18:16:42 Oil fans have thin skin? Probably, but it's a flames fan who got sucked in & felt the need to comment on a funny picture

3165 2018-12-12 18:15:27 Don’t press hard with a razor, I’d use oil instead of shaving cream. And make sure to NOT touch your face after shaving. Your pores stay wide open after that stuff

3168 2018-12-12 18:15:11 @JoeNBC 
Morning Joe,

Just a quick question...
You Hate Us #Conservatives and our views, so why do you use a picture of Abraham Lincoln for your profile picture as you know he was the Founder of the #Republican party?

That's like "oil and water" together isn't it?
Just curious
3169 2018-12-12 18:15:02 We’re developing into a broad energy company that provides energy with lower emissions. At Johan Sverdrup, for each barrel of oil produced, we will emit 0.67 kg of CO2, which is very low compared to the 17 kg CO2/boe industrial average. #highvaluelowcarbon #COP24
3170 2018-12-12 18:15:00 I suspect corrupt Longshoremem and the Mafia dependant on Montreal foreign oil imports maybe part of the explanation of Quebec's stance.
3171 2018-12-12 18:14:52 Smoke and mirrors snake oil salesman tactics, duplicitous apology for a PM
3172 2018-12-12 18:14:49 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
3173 2018-12-12 18:14:26 Despite what WM will tell you there is an obscene amount of recoverable oil and gas (without fracking) for at least the next 160 years at current production from the north sea. Also, research oil in the clyde. WM won't allow drilling because trident is based there.
3174 2018-12-12 18:14:25 Smell peppermint oil!!! It works every time
3175 2018-12-12 18:14:22 Well a lot of people gave advice here, not sure what's best but - I pressed firm tofu for a couple of hours to remove some water, then sliced and dusted with seasoned cornflour. Used a lot of oil (~1cm depth), cooked for a long time (slices took at least ten minutes in batches).
3176 2018-12-12 18:14:08 #OFAC published a settlement agreement with a Chinese #oil & #gas company today. Company has to pay a fine of $2,774,972.

3179 2018-12-12 18:13:57 Hai God. See they most snatched my phone at oil mill today. 
Thank God for my pop socket that helped my grip. 

And the third had the effontry to come back and ask why I was accusing him. Fool

And I thought I took precautions by taking the windows a bit up.
3180 2018-12-12 18:13:53 Labour as a party took us to Iraq. They knew their was nothing their, Was motivated by money & oil.
3181 2018-12-12 18:13:50 My yaya just told me she wanted an oil pen with the good shit in it , why tf is she so cute
3182 2018-12-12 18:13:44 i don't think it's about offshore drilling as a single issue in a vacuum, it's about not being aligned with big oil/gas and actually being willing to do something about climate change. and someone who wants *more* drilling in 2018 probably doesn't give a shit about that
3183 2018-12-12 18:13:39 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
3184 2018-12-12 18:13:39 That’s tricky as Texas is a massive oil producer so there is a lot of oil money on both sides of the isle. ND is similar here. Just saying oil money is bad in Texas is like shooting a target with buckshot and being proud you hit a bullseye.
3185 2018-12-12 18:13:34 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
3186 2018-12-12 18:13:23 I'm not even a republican, but I'll vote for them over ANY leftist. simply because I refuse to be a victim.
3187 2018-12-12 18:13:16 InfoChip's rugged #RFID tag carriers can withstand extreme temperatures, exposure to #oil, chemicals, water, dust & other contaminants.
3188 2018-12-12 18:12:48 if you don't get it after 4 attempts, there's no hope for you at this point. I do hope you wake up one day and see you're being used. I walked away from the left towards the end of Obama. he had me fooled for a while, now I know better. I will NEVER vote for the left.
3189 2018-12-12 18:12:08 made pasta rn and i always do this thing where i put a bit of olive oil at the top (i know it rises anyway) and my excuse was that my mum does it but she just called me a dumbass and she never fuckin did that so where tf did i pick it up??

3191 2018-12-12 18:11:55 The main reason for not building refineries it takes approximately 30 years to get return on investment. Also Alberta tar sands oil is extremely expensive to process.

3193 2018-12-12 18:11:49 For a billionaire in the oil & gas industry from India. How does this match up with battling climate change?
3194 2018-12-12 18:11:48 I have purchased some ramekins, a sifter/strainer, and a oven/bbq/oil ready digital thermometer. I am going to make good shit in the coming months
3195 2018-12-12 18:11:42 Too little too late she was warned about these problems in the oil industry
3 years ago and did nothing.
3196 2018-12-12 18:11:26 I need a friend in the oil & gas industry in Port-harcourt 
3197 2018-12-12 18:11:25 @jordanfordsa 
Very disappointed in service department.
Doesn't do any good to have appts for oil changes when after 45 minutes your told thecar wasn't checked in when you know it was.
Left upset and took my car to Master Lube.
I will never take or buy another vehicle there again
3198 2018-12-12 18:11:20 We should be happy oil has got us to where we are today buy we also shouldn't cling to the past. Energy is energy. It's not dependent on a single source energy is everywhere.
3199 2018-12-12 18:11:18 日本で移民政策の功罪のような話がされているようだが、二十年前ならともかく現在の日本が積極的に働きたい国として選ばれる可能性が高いとは思えない。（旅行は別。コスト安いし、みんな親切だしね。）

3203 2018-12-12 18:11:02 Hey cryin chuck, your playing checkers with a chess champion, you 5 moves behind yet think your ahead, get the oil changed in your brain pan...your over due
3204 2018-12-12 18:10:59 So I put dry shampoo in my hair this morning and then I get to set and they put oil in it to make it look greasy 
3205 2018-12-12 18:10:56 Agree, Butts and Trudeau want to end the oil industry and are going about it the most haphazardly way possible. Equalization is broken. Time to stand up for ourselves.
3206 2018-12-12 18:10:54 Went to the dealership to get my oil changed because it would be free, but now I’ve been waiting for almost two hours and am late for work. Honestly think it would’ve been better to just pay the 30 bones and save 2 hours of my day
3207 2018-12-12 18:10:52 I ain't never getting a oil change at Walmart again

3210 2018-12-12 18:10:18 The message to Saudi Arabia is murdering khashoggi was acceptable as long as the oil prices stay low that way Trump can take credit for low gas prices
3211 2018-12-12 18:10:17 We’ve been dealing with Saudis for years because of their oil. Obama sold them weapons also. Thank God for the first time we are totally oil sufficient and do not need them. Although they do make a good balance against Iran.

3217 2018-12-12 18:09:49 Quite a bit of tax goes to pay for roads not so much for environment generally. To this end, pollution was free. It took choking on our own smog and lead that brought legislation that oil companies were not likely to bring on their own.

3219 2018-12-12 18:09:45 #DYK that Dr. Talei found that, when combined, the cumulative effect of the 20 oils found in #AuraSilk is outstanding, much better than one oil alone.

3223 2018-12-12 18:09:12 That dumpster fire could care less about that stupid wall. All he wants is an episode of his reality show where he fights with the "libs" so his base will get a rise out of it and smash beer cans on their heads. He's a snake oil salesman and a fraud of a human
3224 2018-12-12 18:09:08 You have to come to the conclusion that Trudeau, Butts & McKinnon are environmental extremists and that their duplicious goal has been to shut down any further investment in oil & gas. They just laugh at the naivety that people think they care. This is the goal.
3225 2018-12-12 18:09:08 If Alberta seceding makes it easier for Vancouver Island to secede I'm all for it. Let the oil soaked asshats leave. I hardly ever use my birth certificate anyway.
3226 2018-12-12 18:09:06 last offer sheet was by Uncle Fester in 2013 with ROR. Last one accepted was Penner to Oil 2007. Yes. Rantanen, Marner, Matthews, Laine, Werenski etc. are going to be RFAs. but it makes zero business sense to do one to cripple a team as it in turn damages the market and all teams
3227 2018-12-12 18:09:06 Beto O'Rourke was the #2 recipient (behind Ted Cruz) in congress of the oil and gas lobby in the 2017-2018. Hillary Clinton was big pharma's biggest recipient in 2016, receiving six times more than Paul Ryan. Conversely, 62% of @Ocasio2018 donations were less than $200. Tea.

3230 2018-12-12 18:09:02 We need a strong separation movement to restore property rights and get out from under the boot of unrepresentative, totalitarian, Marxist ideologues like you and Trudeau who are directly responsible for deliberately quashing the oil industry among others. Piss off.SMH. Sheeeesh.
3231 2018-12-12 18:09:00 Learn how to read. I never said Quebec WAS a leader. They are just as bad as the rest, but they have some potential in the form of the people who want more clean and green, not oil and spills.

3236 2018-12-12 18:08:36 Yes. Nationalize the oil industry, we could call it PetroCanada.
3237 2018-12-12 18:08:35 thank you avery. I ended up picking the picture I wanted to paint too late, and it's not the correct medium. its supposed to be oil but I used acrylic since I have a lot more colors. oils are so expensive

3242 2018-12-12 18:07:53 Let me spell this out.

We have <10 years to save our asses from climate change. The oil needs to stay in the ground.

The energy sector has announced-- in its SEC filings which reflect a fiduciary duty to shareholders-- its plans to continue taking out of the ground
3243 2018-12-12 18:07:52 Politicians should get  together with the world leaders and decide we're not going to trade with China if they continue to not trade Fair

3251 2018-12-12 18:07:20 You know what else the SNP have done recently? Told WM that their policy is to maximixe extraction from the North Sea and argue that oil companies need another handout from the public purse.

And yet you still support them.

Russians,Cubans, Chinese and Iranians are taken control of the oil, gold, military bases would be builded, bombers airplanes are already landing.

What has the UK provided Scotland that compares with Norway’s trillion dollar oil fund?
3261 2018-12-12 18:06:08 Wasn't Mexico going to pay for that wall? Now you're threatening to shut down the government if you dont get funding? Talk about a snake oil salesman.

WAS YOUR SOUP ALSO MOTOR OIL ?
3285 2018-12-12 18:04:25 We need to curb the greed of oil. We don't really need it if we have a utility upgrade. Cables under ground in pipes. No need to worry of wind ice or lightning. A solar array in the desert 100sq miles would produce all of our energy needs. Shit works at night. Test one "shocker".
3286 2018-12-12 18:04:09 How is oil and wind compatible?
3287 2018-12-12 18:04:06 Whilst I agree that War needs stopping but neither USA nor UN can bring an end to this War...If USA stop supplying the bombs THEN RUSSIA and CHINA will and you loose an friend in that region and China and Russia will gain the influence in that area and the OIL that's the danger

3289 2018-12-12 18:04:00 Where I do see that oil backed banks are not really a great way to go, I also see that it is a viable and crucial part of the current economy, and thus, able to back the foundation of a national currency. I hope they include others though, the green tech is booming.

3291 2018-12-12 18:03:39 Tell that to the dinosaurs! Did they have cars oil power when the climate changed and wiped em out?
3292 2018-12-12 18:03:26 Ever seen an oil spill?
3293 2018-12-12 18:03:21 Of course. We already control the Opium, Oil, Human Trafficking and Minerals in Middle East. 

Africa hasn't been fully subjugated for the Ruling Elite. Send in the troops. Use disgusting MSM sell outs to push False Flag War as usual.

3295 2018-12-12 18:03:12 What to do if you're in this situation, Turn off the heat, remove the the lid. Wait calmly.
9 out of 10 times this will be enough, but in the small chance of fire continuing, NEVER use water to put out the fire. Water is a oil catalyst.
Use a damp, not wet, cloth to cover the pan

3297 2018-12-12 18:02:47 I’m thinking more the Nordic model. The oil revenues go in the bank and the rich pay higher rates.

3305 2018-12-12 18:02:18 Sure but I think you can only go so far with that. For one thing the price of oil would fall & we have no idea on air travel. A co2 tax that pays out for co2 removal from the air might reach a balance (co2 into the air - co2 pulled out of the air) pretty cheaply,we don't know.
3306 2018-12-12 18:01:58 It was their money, they didn't give them anything but it did lower gas prices which why you backed off sanctions on their oil.

3311 2018-12-12 18:01:38 We're not using our resources well? So, how did Alberta become the cash cow of Canada? Other jurisdictions, such as Venezuela, became poorer by taxing the crap out of the 'rich' despite their oil reserves. Is that the path Alberta needs to go on?
3312 2018-12-12 18:01:16 None of this surprises me; Remember Koffi Annan's son Kojo? He became very wealthy by being a crook, pocketing million's from the " oil for food " program in the early 2000's. That's just one BIG example of the lawlessness of the U.N.

3320 2018-12-12 18:00:40 That's why you talk about boycott anytime another province don't want your oil to spill on its territory? Canada is a disfunctionnal country, has always been, will always be.

3386 2018-12-12 17:54:19 The downhill started with Chavez, Maduro came & made it worse. The problem is the structure of the economy. Highly dependent on oil. Whose revenues they failed to well manage. Plus bloated debt which they misinvested to prop up the regime. Going to the printing press was worse.
3387 2018-12-12 17:54:05 Also when I used Gun Oil on several OxBall cockring products (TPR for some and some silicone) they swelled up and became softer, more spongy with multiple application of use with the Gun Oil silicone lube. I wonder if the added Aloe and Vitamin E had anything to do with it ?
3388 2018-12-12 17:53:58 Stove is electric, no gas. Electricity is shared and kept to a minimum. Some people make sacrifices to help our planet, its not that hard to do or understand. Over-consumption of oil is the problem, not oil itself. Merry Christmas to you as well.
3389 2018-12-12 17:53:56 #UKOG Is now generating cash from multiple oil tanker sales every day.

They bought 30% of Solo onshore iow licence with some of the revenues from those sales.

Onwards and upwards .

Viva!
3390 2018-12-12 17:53:56 Well original all you needed was the car components an gas.. Then they updated the game an the cars required oil an water.. I broke 2 cars before realizing this change.
3391 2018-12-12 17:53:55 Don't invite me to a church where:

1,They sell annoying oil/water
2, Man of God call himself spiritual father
3, Motivational Church 
4, demons are interviewed 
5, Man of God teach to Command angels, angels this angel that.
3392 2018-12-12 17:53:50 Of course the day I leave the house without a purse (by extension, no Advil or peppermint oil) is the day I get blindsided by a migraine hahahahaha cool
3393 2018-12-12 17:53:50 It’s true he couldn’t be a journalist. He was prepared to admit he had been totally taken in by a false witness. The media would rather be boiled in oil than admit their flaws.
3394 2018-12-12 17:53:50 can you have coconut oil? I bet you could make a decent faux brandy butter with that
3395 2018-12-12 17:53:46 Sis why you getting oil changes every month lol
3396 2018-12-12 17:53:43 Why does everyone think that companies can just charge more for oil products? They can't. If they could be charging more then they already would be.
3397 2018-12-12 17:53:36 Curved the colognes and put some Frankincense Oil on today 

Smelling all Nubian and shit 

Good weather for it
3398 2018-12-12 17:53:34 coconut oil tastes really bad
3399 2018-12-12 17:53:33 Oil changes are so annoying

3402 2018-12-12 17:53:26 A little acv & extra virgin olive oil.
3403 2018-12-12 17:53:23 Listen to the song, "oil"by phyno.
You might change your mind
3404 2018-12-12 17:53:23 "Alexit", please, this talk has been around forever and rises when wheat, cattle and oil prices fall. It is cyclical nature of economics and only serves fools. Alberta is landlocked, and if you think the price of pipelines is high now what would it be like in isolation?
3405 2018-12-12 17:53:21 What does a "years' supply" mean? How does one win a years' supply worth of shoes or baby oil? Who determines how much baby oil an average person uses? I use quite a bit... This is just one of the questions that pop into my head as I watch @TheEllenShow
3406 2018-12-12 17:53:13 not to be dramatic but using rosehip oil on my face for the past 3 days has completely changed my skin?? my skin tone evened out, my dry patches went away?? I am glowing??
3407 2018-12-12 17:52:58 Where are the oil tankers sailing down the St-Lawrence?

Reverse Energy East to Cornwall, then ship the oil east down the St-Lawrence...

Our people say, if you don't eat yam because of palm oil, you will eat palm oil because of yam.

Whoever you vote for, the bridge will still be built!
3409 2018-12-12 17:52:53 I guess the fact that global oil demand has & is growing daily since the recession is just a hoax right? Let me guess u walk to work naked & barefoot? Use ZERO plastics? What do u think was required to make that phone ur using bud. Do electric cars roll on Oil Free tires too?
3410 2018-12-12 17:52:45 P1056 - Products and materials. This is a necessary step for conscious consumerism. Think Oil, Gas, Vehicles, Chemicals - linking this with academic articles discussing these products and byproducts - CO2, Ozone, etc
3411 2018-12-12 17:52:44 It seems that the independence argument centres around oil and gas which as everyone knows is a natural resource that will eventually run out. What will replace it?
3412 2018-12-12 17:52:36 Oh and than fry them little oil 
3413 2018-12-12 17:52:18 That's all fine. Point being ...we don't depend on foreign oil any less. Exploring new ways of energy is good for the country. Doesn't mean we will achieve this today... But we need to start being aggressive ( cautiously)
3414 2018-12-12 17:52:17 The narrative of the Niger Delta area of Nigeria has changed. The rich cultural heritage for years submerged by environmental degradation and militancy is well and alive despite the soot and oil spill
3415 2018-12-12 17:52:13 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

3418 2018-12-12 17:51:35 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; (Psalm 45:7)
3419 2018-12-12 17:51:25 You've been tricked into blaming poor people for social ills caused by the incredibly wealthy. Ever wonder how all these problems that immigrants are to blame for started about the exact same time as the 2008 financial crisis.
3420 2018-12-12 17:50:27 Oil change first if the wait isn’t long
3421 2018-12-12 17:50:23 It was a pretty good matte foundation I just hate the light/med coverage. I’m an oil pit only thing that works for me is Lancôme 
3422 2018-12-12 17:50:13 Serious Theft at National Oil Corporation of Kenya. Nation of Looters is officially another name for this nation #NationalOilScandal is explosive. Over 3million liters worth Ksh400million missing from the National Oil Corporation depots. CEO is MaryJane Mwangi! Mtu wetu!
3423 2018-12-12 17:50:06 I would be good with 100% of Hydro production, not just exports, in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, etc. There's a false good/evil dichotomy between Hydro and oil giving Hydro producers a sense of moral superiority when it comes to political rhetoric of 'saving the planet.'

3431 2018-12-12 17:49:12 Pipeline proponents refuse to accept the obvious: that oil demand is set for a steady, inevitable decline. The age of the internal combustion engine is drawing to a close, and it's not Trudeau's fault.

It's so good I thought it was just a digital print. But she sent all the WIP photos and you can see the oil or paint clearly layered. That's one of best presents ever. 
3435 2018-12-12 17:48:57 I throw them in with the pasta for the last two mins then drain and toss in oil, chilli and Parmesan.

3440 2018-12-12 17:48:30 i need to go get my oil changed tomorrow
3441 2018-12-12 17:48:21 I need a oil pen cause I’m over buying blunts at this point ...
3442 2018-12-12 17:48:07 I could listen to her say Toys for Tots all season long! Melania is 
3443 2018-12-12 17:47:59 There’s not a president out there that didn’t have dealings with the studies. After all they do have the oil.
3444 2018-12-12 17:47:55 Call Pia Lauren Spa in Fairfield CT. Just bought some yesterday and it’s infused with peppermint oil. Her son is a world champion fighter and uses it every day.
3445 2018-12-12 17:47:51 Or perhaps it was just cheaper to have foreign oil shipped to eastern ports. The cost per bbl of shipping by tanker is less than the tolling in many pipelines, especially ones that have to cross the Canadian Shield.
3446 2018-12-12 17:47:49 I just told my coworker that I wanted to die and she responded “oh I have an essential oil for that!”
3447 2018-12-12 17:47:49 Tom Ford perfume and body oil for Christmas thanks lol
3448 2018-12-12 17:47:37 Roasted garlic with olive oil cures all haha plus it’s yummy
3449 2018-12-12 17:47:37 Which essential oil is best for people to mind their own fucking business
3450 2018-12-12 17:47:29 @XochforCongress @repbenraylujan please get on board! The expansion of dangerous oil extraction in the Permian Basin imperils New Mexico's children and ties the state's economy to the perpetrators. The #GreenNewDeal is the answer!

3455 2018-12-12 17:47:20 Overhearing this lady hasn't had her oil changed in 11 months.... When she got it changed last they told her come back in 30k miles lol they should've wrote 3k miles..

3458 2018-12-12 17:47:09 when you go to get an oil change and find out you need two new tires, a new bumper and inspection all before the end of the month... guess the bills and christmas gonna have to wait lmfaoo 
3459 2018-12-12 17:46:55 Could I remind all us vets that EVERY citizen is our CIC - and outranks the president. We KNOW better than to throw “honor” malarkey around, when we know about pension rank and mercenary service for oil corporations worldwide. We need to stop our own BS first.

3461 2018-12-12 17:46:49 All other vegetable oils can be self sustained. Since palm oil needs humid and hot conditions it can only be grown in Malaysia and Indonesia. My point was the clearing of the rainforests and orangutan habitats.

Swiss tourism industry is sacred,as are Glyphosate, plastics, Palm Oil, and they don't support EV.  Fascists.
3469 2018-12-12 17:46:10 And I meant soap, not oil...

3471 2018-12-12 17:46:08 Fact is, H is 1/3rd as efficient as BEV, and is pushed by oil companies for obvious reasons.

What happens to used EV batteries? They go into static storage and eventually recycled. 98% recoverable incl all metals. They dont "wear" out as it were.

3474 2018-12-12 17:45:49 We are more dependent on each other than either side would like to admit, should also be pointed out that central Canada got hammered by high currency due to strong oil/resources last decade.  Regional economies fluctuate and it makes the whole Confederation more resilient
3475 2018-12-12 17:45:48 Alberta is a single resource economy. They require very high oil prices to maintain profitability. Alberta is an out of date mining rig. They ride the bull and get savaged by the bear.
3476 2018-12-12 17:45:43 What you are obviously unaware of is that the second largest source of income for the entire country of Mexico, second only to oil, is money sent back from the US. If we shut off that spicket their economy would collapse. They will do whatever we ask to keep that money flowing.
3477 2018-12-12 17:45:33 Great article & interview. Brilliant to hear the complete story behind the origins of the oil. And there is no doubt about the quality of Broighter Gold, its variety of uses & just how lovely it is. Once I discovered it, I’ve never used any other oil. And even better, it’s local.
3478 2018-12-12 17:45:32 We do NOT trust these people that want to phase out our ethically produced oil and will instead cede market share to awful nations like Venezuela, Saudi, Iran, and Russia. If you believe climate is a problem, ONLY individuals and companies can solve it, NOT USELESS GOVERNMENT.
3479 2018-12-12 17:45:23 But it’s ok they have money and oil. They can do what they like the West is powerless to stop them. They bumped off critic of the Crown Prince and what have we done.

3482 2018-12-12 17:45:03 Change my oil for the low tm!! I’m stuck at work til 9 
3483 2018-12-12 17:45:02 Everyone knows we have a problem with non oil revenue. I think it's swinging upward, albeit slowly. What we need,  right now,  are workable approaches to increasing it rapidly.
3484 2018-12-12 17:44:49 These globalist types desperately want their greedy fingers on the Iranian oil!! No doubt the only reason they’re putting up with all the bullshit from the mullahs!!
3485 2018-12-12 17:44:48 We should be "exporting" to Quebec and Eastern Canada. Qc seems to enjoy paying more for unethical Oil. The most likely explanation for Qc's position is corruption. The Quebec longshoremem and Mafia that depend on unethical Foreign Oil imports.
3486 2018-12-12 17:44:43 I  the fact Brett is so vocal about all of this. However the level of restraint n his statements makes me feel like if HIS pockets were not hurting from any of this he really could care less. Its not just about Oil Brett! Its about Culture as well & how we are mostly hated by
3487 2018-12-12 17:44:41 It took an hour to get an oil change and a transmission change and now I have to go back because my car is running very rough and my check engine light is on
3488 2018-12-12 17:44:38 im so fucking poor with oil on azurlane...
3489 2018-12-12 17:44:38 Really important decision area in crude oil here, time cycles etc, if you're a member don't miss the vid from last night and the one from mid day today. On break, will advise when we start triggering again.
3490 2018-12-12 17:44:36 Some of what he says makes sense. Change is what was wanted..change from the snake oil of the haters of straight-white-working- class-men, the SJWs, extremist feminists (which the BBC & rest of media too often represents) etc who have been selling to the public for too many years
3491 2018-12-12 17:44:35 I N N O V A T I ON makes America great we should be leading the world in Clean Energy but the Oil Lobby and their paid stooges have us stuck on stupid to protect a dying energy source. If today's conservatives were around 150 years ago we would still be using Whale Oil.
3492 2018-12-12 17:44:30 Oil companies will go down in history as criminals.

3506 2018-12-12 17:42:33 Sorry buddy you are sadly mistaken. Russia has become a free market trade. Infrastructure is a legacy of  communism. Oil & industrial industries are the main source of economic growth. The presence of McDonald's, shops in Arbat & Tverskaya street is epitome of Capitalism.

1hr later: NEVER FUCKING MIND I JUST WON'T DO ANYTHING PLANNED
3520 2018-12-12 17:41:45 We are looking for a night toolpusher position in any oil and gas company .Would you please help to get it
3521 2018-12-12 17:41:37 I got my tea tree oil from dollar general 
3522 2018-12-12 17:41:35 @jimcramer @KatherineRooss @CramerClub Frustrating to see oil names lagging so badly today...still no buying interest in SLB, BP (I also have VLO).  Doesn’t feel like bottoming.
3523 2018-12-12 17:41:24 The Fraser Institute received $1.7 million from 'sources outside Canada' in one year alone, according to the group's 2010 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) return. $4.3 million in the last decade from 8 major American foundations...the most powerful players in oil and pharmaceuticals.
3524 2018-12-12 17:41:22 lease my hair is oily but it’s not bc i haven’t washed it... it’s bc i put TOO MUCH COCONUT OIL
3525 2018-12-12 17:41:19 He’s a TEXAN what’d you expect
These are individual donations, not corporate
You can’t walk down the street in Texas without brushing twenty people who are connected to oil and gas somehow
Jeepers he’s not even my candidate of choice but this is crazy
3526 2018-12-12 17:41:16 I really hope she stays.
3527 2018-12-12 17:41:10 I’m from DC keep your cologne and point me to the oil man
3528 2018-12-12 17:41:08 Because the dinosaurs left us with oil, and today we have that energy source to use (and, sadly, abuse). 

But there is a point to everything - it's a great interconnectedness.
3529 2018-12-12 17:41:02 Wash it, but the afrobotanics curl activator, then mix oil with water and the curl activator in a spray bottle and use it daily to maintain the curls. Works with mine
3530 2018-12-12 17:41:00 Pipelines are the safest and most environmentally friendly way to get oil and natural gas to refineries and ultimately to you, the consumer. #WednesdayWisdom
3531 2018-12-12 17:40:57 No I wear makeup jus to wear it honestly the only time I wear makeup is when I wanna recreate a look I’ve seen on a day to day i don’t have nothing on my face but lotion & coconut oil right makeup is to enhance but it’s a difference between if u wear it everyday
3532 2018-12-12 17:40:54 Problem is 
There are people that are educated also who believe these things for monetary purposes only 

Coal and oil get them $$$
3533 2018-12-12 17:40:52 There are legitimate environmental concerns with this oil. 

QCers won't take on risk without clear reward. There is no obligation on QC's part. Nor does QC have full right to refuse such a project.

Take it up with the incompetent Feds & your own two-faced Provincial leaders.
3534 2018-12-12 17:40:45 I can’t decide if I rather be responsible and get an oil change or get my nails done first? 
3535 2018-12-12 17:40:40 I bet there's a geranium one, (or more than one, even!) because you can get geranium aromatherapy oil.
3536 2018-12-12 17:40:40 Saline wash and add a drop of eucalyptus essential oil for added potency. Only use the best: doTERRA
3537 2018-12-12 17:40:37 Wallahi and I don't know anyone that knows him
3538 2018-12-12 17:40:37 Tooth pain can suck, if painkillers arnt working you can try clove oil on your gums or swill some whiskey around your mouth to numb it.
3539 2018-12-12 17:40:36 I mean it can't be inflation really the dollar is nigh and our rates higher but bloomberg is predicting a fall in the dollar.  Which seems weird.  Oil is lower, I don't see price pressure save on credit.
3540 2018-12-12 17:40:27 I gently rub the rosehip oil over my hard nipples – bij Applebee's
3541 2018-12-12 17:40:20 Lol, more like your neck looks delicious, vampire Hanif.
3542 2018-12-12 17:40:17 Apparently you have snake oil on hand. Don’t get upset for using your own words against you. Big fan of Pee Wee Herman btw.
3543 2018-12-12 17:40:10 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3544 2018-12-12 17:40:04 How do I lose my oil pen in my crib
3545 2018-12-12 17:39:59 I work in the chemical plants. Work has slowed down and that will be the trend as the price for oil keeps dropping. But, whatever. I’m stupid and I don’t know how money works
3546 2018-12-12 17:39:56 Plastic is made from oil. Eventually the bottle will synergize back to oil.
3547 2018-12-12 17:39:54 Obama brags that drilling and oil production in the us was the highest in history under him......so were gonna blame him too right?
3548 2018-12-12 17:39:51 Im old enough to remember him getting his backup traded and getting in a dick swinging contest with his head coach over his snake oil salesman trainer. Wait ...
3549 2018-12-12 17:39:50 probably an oil based remover but idk that mess looks permanent
3550 2018-12-12 17:39:49 So we buy oil from Saudi Arabia, make jet fuel from it, then give it back to Saudi Arabia in the form of free refueling of their warplanes for their war in Yemen.  Doesn't sound like capitalism to me.  There is no profit in it.  Sounds like Donald Trump economics to me.
3551 2018-12-12 17:39:45 because if you were vegan you would’ve said so. and you wouldn’t be blaming poor vegans for doing the best they can. palm oil has the highest yield by land area so other oils would be even less sustainable. i AM educated, but it’s clear you’re not. bye bitch.
3552 2018-12-12 17:39:35 When I was a mechanic, we barely broke even or lost on all the oil changes. The purpose was getting regular customers in the door.
3553 2018-12-12 17:39:30 tlg jawabkan. yes it is. means kulit awak tak sesuai dgn brand yg awk pakai tu. awk pakai cleansing oil brand apa?
3554 2018-12-12 17:39:29 Tramitame el gas oil raca ...
3555 2018-12-12 17:38:50 No but for the most part they don’t pretend to lead the world on human rights. I hope the eu isn’t as morally bankrupt as KSA which seems too busy taking oil/BRI money as well
3556 2018-12-12 17:38:46 Some more affordable oils you can put on your face: Rosehip oil, Argan oil, marula oil
3557 2018-12-12 17:38:41 A whole fucking 2 hrs for an oil change fml 
3558 2018-12-12 17:38:34 With who tho? He’d never fight with his daddy Putin or his oil magnates in the Middle East or his buddy Kim. France or Canada or Germany maybe? He talks a lot of crap about them and the EU.
3559 2018-12-12 17:38:29 The only true essential oil is my dick oil.
3560 2018-12-12 17:38:26 What large payments they don't cover half of what we are owed and will have after indy we won't be paying £30billion for imaginary defences and EU fees and that doesn't include our oil and the fact we can be fully self sufficient country with our resources England won't be.
3561 2018-12-12 17:38:18 This is huge. We r held hostage by oil countries no more.
3562 2018-12-12 17:37:58 I have reached the level of lame where I’m really excited that I get to bring a non-school related book with me to get my oil changed
3563 2018-12-12 17:37:54 From individuals? No, we shouldn’t care.
Beto doesn’t head my personal ideal ticket, but I don’t have a problem with someone who works on an oil rig saying, hey, I like this guy, and sending him some money.
3564 2018-12-12 17:37:51 I believe Libya was 'bumped up' because Gaddafi was going to change the money system for the purchase of oil  to the DINAR.  
Like Saddam Hussein did.  Except he switched it to the Euro.
3565 2018-12-12 17:37:48 I guess it's good having a button ready to call for a tow. But checking your oil regularly wont be alot of help if you have a crappy car. Just saying!
3566 2018-12-12 17:37:41 Is this Oil Mill really necessary?
3567 2018-12-12 17:37:41 This #Keto life isn’t bad. #IntermittentFasting isn’t either. Had a bomb ass breakfast omelet  Then had green tea with coconut oil in it. Wasn’t half bad. I’m down 4lbs already 
3568 2018-12-12 17:37:34 Nigeria Continues To Depend Heavily On Oil Export Revenue: Despite assurances that Nigeria is… @environmentguru

3570 2018-12-12 17:37:29 Local 777 Plumbers, Pipefitters and Service Techs has immediate job opportunities for licensed B-2 OIL BURNER TECHS in the Danbury area. If interested please contact Jay More 203-317-4750 EXT 14.
3571 2018-12-12 17:37:09 Power grab? Is this all about big oil, nukes, guns and drugs?
3572 2018-12-12 17:37:09 It's doubtful we'll ever find energy that's cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuels. Saudi oil is basically free energy that spurts out of the ground. This is why it's gravely important to find technologies that can act as substitutes for a reasonable cost. I'm optimistic on this.
3573 2018-12-12 17:37:06 In the oven, roast at 400 degrees until the skin looks a little wrinkly, and it’s done. On the stove, I just toss it with a little olive oil and put it in a skillet on medium until a fork passes through it easily, no longer or it will get mushy. Hope that helps!
3574 2018-12-12 17:37:00 I keep burping my fish oil, about to barf.
3575 2018-12-12 17:36:56 It was suggested to try coconut oil. I have jojoba oil so I tried that first. All organic.
3576 2018-12-12 17:36:49 They would never agree because the oil companies care a lot less about the wall than they do about oil subsidies and eliminating competition. And the oil companies support the legislators who make the laws.
3577 2018-12-12 17:36:41 SHE NEEDS SOME CBD OIL ON IV STAT AND A CONVICTION FOR KNOWING ABOUT EVIL BUT NOT REPORTING IT...
3578 2018-12-12 17:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
3579 2018-12-12 17:36:30 Hello ADHD! This is my daily battle. Being an adult with ADHD and having so many dreams that I want to turn into a reality. Thankfully, natural remedies, such as essential oils and CBD oil help me to stay on task. I try to focus only on one thing.
3580 2018-12-12 17:36:19 One #nigeria my foot, no running water, no electricity, educational system zero, no well equipped hospitals, no good roads, sports zero, there are four oil refinery's in Nigeria but they take crude oil abroad to refine, are they human beings?
3581 2018-12-12 17:36:10 What a way Cuthbert et al crawl out back but ef unu tink we figet bout the Petrojam scamming unu have a next guess coming. Weh di oil deh. We di money weh Yolande and Andrew (whichever one) tief.?
3582 2018-12-12 17:36:04 Although I should get up & get an oil change but nahhh lmao

Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides by SOPHIE

3584 2018-12-12 17:35:44 I literally gave him 1/4 teaspoon of coconut oil off of a measuring spoon and he just ate it like a treat. It’s got a consistency of like ... waxy butter lol. Super easy.
3585 2018-12-12 17:35:22 The irony there is these people are anti-government, free-market activists when the big bucks from oil is rolling in, but then they cry out for government intervention when times get tough. Pick a lane people. SMH
3586 2018-12-12 17:35:22 CBD lip balm. CBD OIL ! Hit me up. 3rd party tested and Kentucky grown.
3587 2018-12-12 17:35:16 The hair oil my mom bought straight up smells like beer but at least it works with growth 
3588 2018-12-12 17:35:01 You mean for geopolitical reasons? From an economic perspective it's better to shut down the most expensive oil wells first.
3589 2018-12-12 17:34:58 Question of the Day: What do you think of Rachel Notley's plan to build a new refinery in the midst of an ongoing oil crisis?
3590 2018-12-12 17:34:55 This week’s domestic crude oil production estimate incorporates a re-benchmarking that lowered estimated volumes by 106,000 barrels per day, which is less than 1.0% of this week’s estimated production total.

EIA #OOTT
3591 2018-12-12 17:34:55 I hate when the guy at the oil change place tries to shame me or how badly I needed an oil change. 

“Oil very low. You are way over. You really need an oil change.” 

Yes I know sir. That’s why I’m here getting an oil change.
3592 2018-12-12 17:34:52 Somebody remind me to buy some organic extra virgin coconut oil.
3593 2018-12-12 17:34:48 I used jojoba oil. See if that works.
3594 2018-12-12 17:34:40 Wellcome oil Minister

3596 2018-12-12 17:34:33 Bruh I really love what I do. I have this lady who got some brain tumors removed earlier this year and she gets hella severe headaches now so she coined me with the task of making her some medicated veggie oil bc my stuff is the only thing that helps with the migraines :’) :’)
3597 2018-12-12 17:34:31 An oil and gas company signs a lease with an individual to use their land to extract natural gas. Then they are given a 1099 for royalties.
3598 2018-12-12 17:34:27 I've never seen a holographic program this detailed before. I swear I can almost smell the gun oil.
3599 2018-12-12 17:34:23 Went there in 1994. Found homes for Obsolete drilling pipe and Christmas trees(oil valves) as we helped remote villages with new water wells.
3600 2018-12-12 17:34:00 No you not bro. She drinks motor oil with a hint of oak. Don’t drink with her. Plus she’s a light weight lmao
3601 2018-12-12 17:33:43 Conservatives have said for years Alberta should refine more oil but when the NDP move on the idea all of a sudden it’s a bad idea?
3602 2018-12-12 17:33:37 Yes, and your point is? I'm just pointing out the fact that the Cowboys have a very strong offense. Did you see the Titans game? Squirrel oil must have been shared among many. My hope is that the Colts fans outnumber the Cowboy fans.
3603 2018-12-12 17:33:36 O yes I would rub more oil on
3604 2018-12-12 17:33:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

3606 2018-12-12 17:33:19 2020 is about making sure we defeat the fake progressive AIPAC funded Beto who takes hundreds of thousands of dollar from oil and gas and nominate real progressive BERNIE for POTUS !

3609 2018-12-12 17:32:24 Is it true that $2700 is the individual contribution limit?  Is it true that even oil execs who live in the U.S. are American citizens who get to participate in Democracy or have Sirota et al decided they are to be disenfranchised? What rights do you forgoe based on your job?
3610 2018-12-12 17:32:16 I just learned that oil paint doesn’t dry over night and it’s also very difficult to wash off your hands 
3611 2018-12-12 17:32:09 The high volume of pitches seems like evidence of just how much $$$ is going into cannabis companies & PR right now. Likely plenty of snake oil salesman trying to make a buck off that. Scams or not though, the glut of “wellness” products shows how many people have unmet needs.
3612 2018-12-12 17:32:03 Nice oil layer guaranteed in a few years.

3614 2018-12-12 17:31:57 Yep.  100% Agree.

But, $Oil is down, he might take some credit for it. 
3615 2018-12-12 17:31:54 All UN resolutions were paid by the oil money of Saudi Arabia and its servant countries. That's why no one listens to them. The UN is being destroyed rapidly, now.
3616 2018-12-12 17:31:50 About to grow my beard out, any beard oil suggestions?
3617 2018-12-12 17:31:48 They wouldn’t have to.  The US would welcome them with open arms.
And BC would have no oil at all, but fortunately they have the cheaper, more available green options.
3618 2018-12-12 17:31:09 I have been applying the sulfur8 braid oil at night but by the next afternoon/evening, my scalp is bone dry . I also think bc these are bigger braids I'm not getting all of my scalp so that's causing the problem
3619 2018-12-12 17:31:06 jan is like beyonce playing an oil sheik's 40th
3620 2018-12-12 17:30:55 Wear a hydrating primer! Even... ESPECIALLY with oily skin, because if you’re oily, your skin not being properly moisturized is going to make it worse. I have dry/combo skin with an oily t zone and a hydrating primer + a good matte foundation keeps my oil at bay without drying
3621 2018-12-12 17:30:51 Indeed Richard and to that effect, I truly believe we should be grateful to KSA for providing such a high proportion of our oil requirements.
3622 2018-12-12 17:30:50 If food and medicine are blocked all the cars behind those lorries are also blocked they will contain pilots train drivers nurses oil refinery workers everything stops The consequences are such that freetrade will soon again be established
3623 2018-12-12 17:30:50 This administration refuses to invest in anything that has long term benefits. That’s why medical research, renewable energy, and wildlife protection will be gutted but lobbying for coal and oil will be full steam ahead. There is no long term vision or sense of responsibility.
3624 2018-12-12 17:30:47 I left peanut oil on her ass, dat hoe chic-fil-a’d
3625 2018-12-12 17:30:34 Socialist Venezuela was doing quite well until the US forced them into a downhill tumble because they wouldn’t sell their oil on the US terms. Forcing the price of Venezuelan oil to a low has meant a massive budget shortfall.

4) TRILLIONS in tax benefits to people so they can hire for their new enterprises.
3628 2018-12-12 17:30:27 Did @SenSchumer get payola to maintain status quo with Big Oil’s grip on our representatives? I’ve voted Dem all my voting life. Inaction on Global Warming is collusion with Big Oil.
3629 2018-12-12 17:30:26 Will any #Republicans be able to break the #FossilFuel spell, & not get primaried? It is unlikely. Then we must not wait for a #GOP split on #ClimateChange. What we need is to do is put the coal, fracking, & oil industry on notice in many different ways. Let's uncover their dirt!
3630 2018-12-12 17:30:10 Oil is toxic and harmful when spilt onto the earth, our booms absorb oil, eradicating pollutants, offering a safe #environment.
3631 2018-12-12 17:30:08 I was getting an oil change and the guys in the shop started my truck and reved it hella loud and they all got excited  not gonna lie I did too
3632 2018-12-12 17:30:07 Yeah, you can get the same access to education, the same access to nutrition, the same physical security without riding around in a Hummer consuming an oil field’s worth of gas every time you drive down the street, that would be ideal.

3640 2018-12-12 17:29:35 Did u see love here?
3641 2018-12-12 17:29:32 Our world would almost grind to a halt without oil. Factories would stop running. So would cars. Airplanes would be grounded. Tractors on the farm would sputter to a standstill and rust. And people's homes and offices, if heated by oil, would freeze in winter. @KateStewart22
3642 2018-12-12 17:29:32 Yes but if the federal level is allowing extraction of oil and coal and other polluting practices, that means that states won’t actually be able to control water pollution.

あれもジャパンバッシングのさなかで起きた事件だった。
3646 2018-12-12 17:29:22 Thanks dad . How can you possibly fuck up an oil change lol.
3647 2018-12-12 17:29:20 the last thing you really want to do is drive all the domestic producers out of business only to have the saudis pick up the slack and have oil consumption stay constant
3648 2018-12-12 17:29:18 Oil money like you
3649 2018-12-12 17:29:16 Why are you like this na?? Palm Oil is for you.
3650 2018-12-12 17:29:15 FINALLY getting my oil changed 
3651 2018-12-12 17:29:12 Yes, oysters have carbs but not real high. My can of smoked oysters in olive oil has 8g of carbs per 3 ounces (85 grams). The benefits of oysters outweigh the negative effects of the carbs, in my opinion.
3652 2018-12-12 17:29:03 ไม่เป็นไรค่าา เราไม่อยากให้เข้าใจผิดเฉยๆ
3653 2018-12-12 17:28:57 Let us know what worked best for the cat. Oh I had a coconut scented oil too.  use sparingly so yourcat doesn’t get too oily. Thinking now, are all of these edible ??  I’d still like to know what works best maybe a touch of any kitchen oils?? let me know

Fact about the race for the Weald Oil.

The Gatwick Gusher is passing the 3 furlong marker.

The Brockham Dribbler is still in the starting gates

Will it ever get off the mark?

Vonk and Tid's missed  the starters flag.

Time will tell .
3655 2018-12-12 17:28:26 A country which have problems like #BlackLivesMatter, #Antisemitism & #Islamophobia, migrants in tears and waged tens of wars for #Oil, does not raise voice 4 victims of #Kashmir & #Palestine but black listed #Pakistan 4 religious matters. Is #US even on moral ground to do that?
3656 2018-12-12 17:28:12 Woke up with a headache but applied some peppermint oil to my temples, and now I’m feeling great!! How are you??
3657 2018-12-12 17:28:06 Yes indeed. Also along Mbagathi river near the entrance to @KephisKe . They arw really polluting the rivers.  Also remove mechanics along Nandi rd. They are spilling oil into the drains along Nandi rd and Ngong rd. This ends up in Miotoni river. @farmermaina @brayo1 @KLDA_Nbi

3659 2018-12-12 17:28:00 This man is known for aure Sarki..he marries and divorces ...pls I’m already angry enough..he has married and divorced upto 20 women fah..yes Islam accepts this!..but his is just extraordinary
3660 2018-12-12 17:27:58 Gas! Gas!! Damn your eyes, Sir, it's a whale oil lamp.. we are not anarchists.. Much more of your gas talk and I and the other Stockingers shall be forced to invoke the spirit of the Swing riots.
3661 2018-12-12 17:27:58 its also kind of a weird industry where you have a mix of low-profit-margin sources in the US, north sea etc competiting with saudi oil which is essentially all profit but limited by opec production quotas
3662 2018-12-12 17:27:48 Omg thank you! I’ve used coconut oil before and it was amazing!!
3663 2018-12-12 17:27:29 Great to hear this news. I'm tired of hearing medical doctors telling people chemo is a good cure for cancer. Thc oil has a better cure rate.
3664 2018-12-12 17:27:27 What is cannabis oil? It is cannabis flower infused into an MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) carrier oil and decarboxylated. We use @brokencoast.ca oil which is whole plant and full spectrum and encapsulate into 2-piece gelatin capsules for easy dosing and zero taste.
3665 2018-12-12 17:27:07 Laurals' patch notes v 1.0.0
*Horses now no longer suffer leg fragility and autoheal leg problems
*has created a mass network of cloning systems(current use unknown) 
*Eliminated the extremely rich and reduced CO2 envisions to pre-gasoline conditions
*oil and gas now obsolete
3666 2018-12-12 17:27:07 ya it’s great but you have to use it just the right way! in the am i’ve been doing a tiny bit of rosehip seed oil + the cold cream & it’s just the right amount of moisture for me, i’m super dry this time of year
3667 2018-12-12 17:27:00 Sophie - Oil of every pearls un-insides without a doubt
3668 2018-12-12 17:26:55 Is there a futures product to trade Canadian oil?
3669 2018-12-12 17:26:54 Say goodbye to the great lakes, thanks to Big Oil.
3670 2018-12-12 17:26:50 Yeah, I remember her because, she was passionate about cleaning the oil spill in Ogoni but,  after she left, the clean up became a mirage. Well the retired minister's name is Ibrahim Jubril.
3671 2018-12-12 17:26:45 good point. poor countries could bootstrap wind and solar, same as we bootstrapped fossil fuels. i think disbanding an oil company would motivate the others to stop selling fossil fuels to poor countries. and it would motivate us to make "alternatives" the only alternative.
3672 2018-12-12 17:26:40 Have both and fry the chicken in weed oil.
3673 2018-12-12 17:26:39 There's oil. I mean, we got oil, but we can always use more.
3674 2018-12-12 17:26:27 I’m always excited when the oil man comes 
3675 2018-12-12 17:26:26 What you exactly mean by giving out money to Iran?! It was income of Iran from export of oil which was  blocked in non-american banks and had nothing to USA . On the opposite , the money of building the stupid wall comes from American taxpayers pockets.
3676 2018-12-12 17:26:23 #Aaog...last top up on the close...couldnt resist....and relax....the Oil will come whens it good and ready.....not something you rush....#Aaog
3677 2018-12-12 17:26:18 Furnace oil based power plants are either on low-list of power purchase of NTDC or closed. To get rid of FO use, RLNG based 3 combined cycle power plants were installed in Punjab, which are working on 60% eff.
3678 2018-12-12 17:26:13 We need common sense in Government, I will be voting Conservative in the next election and expect them to do right when it comes to immigration, oil pipelines, carbon tax, and equalization payments to Provinces. I want the common sense that’s lacking in today’s Liberal Government
3679 2018-12-12 17:26:12 Stop frying things in margarine. Use a light coating of canola or olive oil. Real Butter, sparingly to taste... Your arteries will thank you.
3680 2018-12-12 17:26:03 Earth to wolfman. Quebec stated no western pipeline or oil is welcome in Quebec. They like the dictator and Saudi oil in Quebec.
3681 2018-12-12 17:25:50 Swear to god I jus went from a $62 oil change to niggas talkin me into selling my next child  these niggas better get commission how hard he done sold me extra services
3682 2018-12-12 17:25:41 Bro Henry. How Palm oil connect to hair?.Lets be guided.
3683 2018-12-12 17:25:25 @SenSchumer such a disappointment;  Dems who talk climate change then vote for maintaining oil corporation agendas.  Vote him out!
3684 2018-12-12 17:25:21 Wah ji wah Mr @Asad_Umar  have admitted during talking with foreign Media that we have done all what IMF need 
We have increased oil prices 
We have increased Gas Prices 
We have devalued Rupee against $
We hav increased/imposed  taxes , supplementary budget
3685 2018-12-12 17:25:17 Again, this is a bizarre reading. First, I don't think I'd ever written a story about the mineral oil issue. Second, it was something several cardiologists mentioned as an issue to me. You're making up your own narrative.
3686 2018-12-12 17:25:15 Remittances, $$ sent home by Mexican nationals, bring more money to Mexican coffers than their oil exports. That wall will pay for itself in one year, VIA MEXICO, just by reducing the annual $1.26+ BILLION in illegal wages.
3687 2018-12-12 17:25:10 "Our most important resource isn't our oil, it is our people."#chinakwt #crossculturaldiwaniya #ccdkw
3688 2018-12-12 17:25:07 Billions in infrastructure funding. Hundreds of millions in funds to offset the impact of the oil price differential.
3689 2018-12-12 17:24:57 You only gotta let ya car run for maybe 10 seconds. Just so the oil can circulate. Sitting in ya car for 10 minutes is unnecessary. Don’t let em lie to you
3690 2018-12-12 17:24:53 @1057WROR I enjoy your music selections, but that doofy deep state financial commercial just made me switch you off. I don’t need to hear bullshit snake oil salesmen pushing conspiracy theories between songs, thanks.
3691 2018-12-12 17:24:49 I need CBD oil in my life ASAP these joints are crying for it 
3692 2018-12-12 17:24:48 I am quite sure that ship has sailed. The anti oil lobby has turned most people in the east against any oil development in the west. Ignorance and misinformation leads people to be ok with Saudi oil over "dirty" Alberta oil.
3693 2018-12-12 17:24:42 The "oil crisis" was caused by the oil industry itself.
3694 2018-12-12 17:24:34 Wonder if he'll leave to become a snake oil salesman 
3695 2018-12-12 17:24:30 Thanks ! So much Solar Energy, anyone using it for farming or residential ? Sana'a has deep oil & gas deposits , but they never work them, very sad imams & ayatollahs power of destruction. They even talk about change away from unelected religious leaders ? Take good care.
3696 2018-12-12 17:24:30 USA specifically Teumo needs to keep his nose out of the oil market.  I am so over supporting him.  He is an anti oil zealot.
3697 2018-12-12 17:24:14 my oil change light came on and that’s probably the last thing i need in my life
3698 2018-12-12 17:24:13 You have attitude and I like that.
Good luck to you too.
3699 2018-12-12 17:24:10 My shop didn’t charge me for my oil change, and also fixed my boost leak 
3700 2018-12-12 17:24:10 Omfg. My car repairs are over $2500. Once I get the check I can pay my registration, oil change, brake job! Then when I get my tax return I can fix my bumper, I hope..
3701 2018-12-12 17:24:07 Yes! Clean them as best as you can, rub with oil and sprinkle with some salt, put some water in the pan and cover with foil, and then bake until tender (it will probably take an hour or so at 400F depending on the size). Cool and peel. (It can get a little messy though.)
3702 2018-12-12 17:23:49 What's the purpose of the essential oil?
3703 2018-12-12 17:23:43 Yeah, but oil
3704 2018-12-12 17:23:41 From close up it looks nice but from afar????? Looks like someone was changing oil for a car
3705 2018-12-12 17:23:41 Hello Craig,

Thanks for reaching out.

We currently offer CBD oil which falls under the Yellow Spectrum - Tweed CBD Oil

Can you send us a DM including your Customer ID # so we can look up your order history and determine if you are eligible for our product supply guarantee?
3706 2018-12-12 17:23:33 There is clearly a plate under the newspaper (it’s used to soak the oil) and the bread is on a plate. My fat ass would take some chicken and go tho.
3707 2018-12-12 17:23:33 Enough of the victim mentality. You need to stop blaming others for the failures of the Conservatives that have been mismanaging Alberta for the last 40 years. Obviously an oil based economy controlled by the industry a bad idea.
3708 2018-12-12 17:23:23 This just reminded me I need an oil change thanks 
3709 2018-12-12 17:23:18 @summersfinsta have you tried fur oil??
3710 2018-12-12 17:23:17 Putting off this oil change 
3711 2018-12-12 17:23:12 I am officially festive. Sesame and honey glazed parsnips and glazed carrots made, stuffings prepared, ready to go in the freezer for an easy ride on 25th, plus for that added Yuletide feel, I spilled a bottle of festive scented oil all over me at The White Company. 
3712 2018-12-12 17:23:12 I saw a guy on the metro that had similar length hair and with just some oil it looked pretty awesome but I'm too lazy to style my hair with anything but a comb
3713 2018-12-12 17:23:05 S&P +1.6%, DAX +1.4%.

Deutsche Bank +8%, Twitter +6%, Netflix +5%, Amazon & AMD & Micron +3%, Microsoft +2%, crude oil & Apple +1%, Verizon -2%, Vix -5%, Under Armour -9%.

3” of fresh snow, 28°F here in Idaho Falls.

Merry Christmas!
3714 2018-12-12 17:23:02 That’s a good idea or you can use your hair products if you use antistatic things.  I have an argon oil I use on my hair just rub a drop in your hands rub hands together then over the cat.   I used to shock my cat so bad you’d She the spark. Sometimes in her nose too. Poor baby
3715 2018-12-12 17:22:45 Talking to a buddy about starting an environmental tech company.

"No one with enough money to invest in this would, though. All oil or whatever."
"Then we'll just ask president Ocasio Cortez in a few years."

Counting on you @Ocasio2018

3716 2018-12-12 17:22:45 I already have problems with stubborn, dark upper lip hair I do not need beard oil 
3717 2018-12-12 17:22:43 Coney was and is a republican.  Coney has been a republican all his life.   So yes there are some republicans in the FBI.  Most FBIAgents are republicans.  And most people with average to high IQ see trump for what he truelyis,  a snake oil salesman.  This is why trump is hated.
3718 2018-12-12 17:22:41 In what way has Alberta been "thrown under the bus"?

When the federal government expidited & extended EI, when they bought us a pipeline, or when they agreed to purchase railcars to get our oil moving?
3719 2018-12-12 17:22:38 Gotta clean my deep fryer and last time I did this...bruh...oil was everywhere 
3720 2018-12-12 17:22:28 Four hundred bucks on home heating oil today happy holidays from the fossil fuel industry. #SeasonsBeatings
3721 2018-12-12 17:22:12 Is it all part of the master plan for Trump to increase US oil production and press on OPEC to lower prices to help Putin?
3722 2018-12-12 17:22:12 @DFWToyota met the GM at my work. Very professional guy. Explained to him how his employees saved us from a mess from a toy dealership in Plano by doing legit warranty work denied by the dealer in Plano. Engine rebuilt and solved major oil consumption. Thx Toyota Richardson.
3723 2018-12-12 17:22:10 Hehehehe!!! Truth is like oil on water, it can never submerge.
3724 2018-12-12 17:22:09 Raw honey, love melting it down with a touch of olive oil and giving myself a facial massage.
3725 2018-12-12 17:21:52 this is like an oil painting
3726 2018-12-12 17:21:52 Learning heavily relies on quality sleep. I recommend the following tricks to improve your sleep - air purifier (set automatically during the day), air humidifier with essential oil, chill pad (optimal sleeping temp 60-67F), blackout blinds, stop to snore, and no alarm.
3727 2018-12-12 17:21:50 @ZacharyLevi vegetable oil laxative. Good luck

3737 2018-12-12 17:20:33 Er, why aren't u calculating furnance oil cost which Pak imports? U sound like an oil lobbyist
3738 2018-12-12 17:20:32 It’s a generation defined by indebtedness, a lack of sex, and beard oil.

3741 2018-12-12 17:20:09 Lol, asking a lot from the guy that still thinks the USA should've colonized Iraq oil fields to understand repatriation of seized funds. 
Does no one but me remember the 'master dealmaker' telling every voter in this country he'd get his wall money from Mexico?
3742 2018-12-12 17:20:09 FEC applauds 3.32% non- oil sector growth in 3rd Quarter, 2018.
3743 2018-12-12 17:20:00 If you want to work, there are lots of programs to help retrain you for fields not as volatile as oil and gas.
3744 2018-12-12 17:20:00 Word salad please with vinegar and oil.

3746 2018-12-12 17:19:50 オイル様こんばんは。

…在庫管理！？((((；ﾟДﾟ)))))))
3747 2018-12-12 17:19:48 does anyone know if ulta sells tea tree oil? or really anywhere that sells it in store?
3748 2018-12-12 17:19:47 I agree It would def be nice to not have to deal with these people, if we become more energy independent that could be more of a possibility since rn we buy a lot of oil from them. But nationalistic tendencies only lead to isolation and then war.
3749 2018-12-12 17:19:41 Any cultured/lab meat process scaled up enough to feed a real % of the world will require industrial inputs that will make those of industrial ag look tiny. Many of those inputs will be petroleum based. Part of me thinks this is just big oil trying to diversify.
3750 2018-12-12 17:19:39 Does the agreement include giving a pass to 80% of the oil and gas providers that your government has done.
3751 2018-12-12 17:19:34 Look, I like Beto. I gave money to him ($25). But he needs to get straight on this. I know that TX is full of oil employees, and the small donations aren't being questioned. We can't afford wishy-washy climate policy that defers to oil companies.
3752 2018-12-12 17:19:33 "Costs you load onto oil companies will pass through to consumers just as like a carbon tax does."

Really, so they don't have a profit margin that could be affected? Oil prices are just determined by what it costs to produce and not markets?
3753 2018-12-12 17:19:16 True.  They are *the* crisis facing the globe but the oil & gas industry billions have spun the narrative that 'green issues' are a niche concern.
3754 2018-12-12 17:19:15 Yo Dad I love you but you gotta stop frying shit with that old ass oil I can smell it upstairs

3756 2018-12-12 17:19:11 Additionally, this article lumps all donations from individuals in the oil/energy industry into one “evil” basket. People who fix leaks, renewable energy (under aegis of larger corps), engineers, geologists etc are ALL oil/gas/energy here. The industry is not a monolith.
3757 2018-12-12 17:19:10 what essential oil will put me to sleep forever?
3758 2018-12-12 17:19:06 with just olive oil, lemon, salt + pepper 
3759 2018-12-12 17:19:05 I dont drive. I walk to work. My phone is generations old. No oil plastics use wherever possible. You literally tweeted the PM on a story about a kid.

3764 2018-12-12 17:18:36 With respect to the recent pressure on Nigeria by OPEC to cut down its output,  proffer an international marketing strategy that will help Nigeria sell off its oil product already lying  on the high sea without potential buyer @BBoason @DrJoeAbah @segalink @economics @business
3765 2018-12-12 17:18:26 And @ProcterGamble Dawn/Fairy can be used to clean oil spills off of cute widdle birds.

So what?

This does not but them a pass.
3766 2018-12-12 17:18:22 Lmao the way my life is set up right now,  That special oil is inaccessible at the moment.
3767 2018-12-12 17:18:02 You can tell them directly why on twitter. Bullshit u r trying to make publicity n butter them get lost. It’s not their effort. It’s oil prices that remain internationally controlled!!

3772 2018-12-12 17:17:34 Perso j'aime pas le bi oil mais plein de personnes l'utilise, sinon crème pour les cicatrices ou même crème hydratante si tu a que ça.

3775 2018-12-12 17:17:19 The purchased a pipeline that moves 300,000 barrels of Alberta oil each and every day.
3776 2018-12-12 17:17:10 I see the world through the lens of my model. According to the model, this report was bullish with a magnitude of 0.57 dpb. The model look for changes in crude oil & petroleum products. A high utilization rate normally means products will build, which they didn't. Hope it helps.
3777 2018-12-12 17:17:02 I posted a video of my windshield being blurry af and was like wtf is going on and 4 people were telling me to use my defrosters like I know I’m not the smartest but I’m not that fkn dumb  it was oil on my windshield :/
3778 2018-12-12 17:16:54 use coconut oil, fuckin' canola oil, anything oily will remove that shit. THEN have your shower and scrub your manbits with baby shampoo. They'll thank you later.

3789 2018-12-12 17:15:44 Application for the bursaries is on going at the District Education Offices  of the 13 districts where oil prospects have been identified
3790 2018-12-12 17:15:34 Really? Name a SINGLE viable replacement for oil. Just one.
3791 2018-12-12 17:15:07 Would you say they struck oil? Hahaha
3792 2018-12-12 17:15:04 Who told you that? The USA-backed @FraserInstitute Fairy? (aka Koch Bros).  @bcliberals had 16 yrs to build secondary industry but sent raw resources out of #BC to big foreign donors. #bcpoli #oil

3794 2018-12-12 17:14:25 Alisson Iran oil loss, sees lower 2019 demand
3795 2018-12-12 17:14:18 El Pasoan here. even thought this might be suspect, lets be real. Beto is the left leaning centrist that TEXAS needs, not the Progressive the country needs. He is backed by Paul Foster, El Paso's OIL billionaire. His current office location and campaign contributions show this.
3796 2018-12-12 17:14:14 Nigeria, Angola= oil economies
3797 2018-12-12 17:14:13 $AMRN I don't agree with the verbal abuse,but Matt basically wrote the same article on 10/10/18 that he wrote about Vascepa 5 years earlier.  He immediately jumped to something is wrong with the mineral oil placebo.
3798 2018-12-12 17:13:58 In less than ten hours I’ve seen the night before Christmas turn into political propaganda and two provinces trying to boycott each other because of a dispute between leaders on oil being a just income. This country is run by children
3799 2018-12-12 17:13:55 using organic oil of her beau? #kbye #timetogetblocked
3800 2018-12-12 17:13:51 @Toyota Please explain to people how does change of oil and oil filter amounts to R 1200 "service", huh??? "Servicing" yourself???
3801 2018-12-12 17:13:42 I can’t wait to find out how much this oil change is going to cost me
3802 2018-12-12 17:13:41 Did they not admit to 'coding' the income off Scotland's oil reserves to different parts of Britain during indyref ?
3803 2018-12-12 17:13:41 Dear Santa:
It would be nice to have a Christmas where no one gets sick, but just in case, let's be proactive. Please bring me some Lysol, Kleenex, essential oils, chicken soup, nasal spray, castor oil, garlic, a round of antibiotics, and some extra toilet paper.
3804 2018-12-12 17:13:36 Is it all part of the master plan for Trump to increase US oil production and press on OPEC to lower prices to help Putin?
3805 2018-12-12 17:13:34 I would have just suggested to throw the whole kid away but yeah olive oil helps too
3806 2018-12-12 17:13:34 I know what you mean.  The Republican Congress, oil lobby, and other corporate polluters, as well as conservative judges have held us back from really making the progress we need.  We need to change our political landscape and representation, entirely and also pray hard.
3807 2018-12-12 17:13:30 I'm not sure what you are saying here. You still had symptoms until then? Was this before or after the tincture? My point here is that if this homeopathic remedy were truly a cure Doctors would prescribe rather than snake oil salesman. I'm well aware of the facts of life.
3808 2018-12-12 17:13:25 Then dip in burning cooking oil
 
3809 2018-12-12 17:13:23 The oil will now be transported via train car & trucks causing huge amounts of smog & having the infrastructure to be expanded.
 wrecks more often than leaks on the pipelines. Once the line is buried the land is returned to normal. Highways grow & tracks cut thru the land.
3810 2018-12-12 17:13:11 "Google CEO grilled on capital hill..."
They did same dog & pony show with the oil, banking & auto manufacturing execs. And we all know what changed...Absolutely nothing. Same old B.S. from Washington. 
3811 2018-12-12 17:13:10 Except you represent the oil and gas industry that is killing Mother Earth. And people can't afford housing now, it's not going to get better thru fracking and destroying our beautiful state.
3812 2018-12-12 17:13:04 Xinjiang is also under china's occupation. Thus Buddhists killing Muslims to continue illigal occupation.
In Afghanistan, Iraq western country want to have control on oil. Thus killing Muslims.

In Kashmir India want to have control on our water resources, thus killing us
3813 2018-12-12 17:13:01 Except a collapse in crude oil price.
3814 2018-12-12 17:12:53 If you zoom in, you look like an oil pastel painting

3828 2018-12-12 17:11:12 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
3829 2018-12-12 17:11:00 Olive Oil + Cream Nivea
3830 2018-12-12 17:10:55 So what was the GC? Was it policy? No. The SG publish a pragmatic cautious document for debate and all of a sudden people start throwing the buzz words about. “Turbo charged austerity” being the main one yet it increased spending IRT and shied away from oil revenues.
3831 2018-12-12 17:10:38 Mine are ALWAYS related to stress or chapped/wind-burnt lips. I’ve gotten them since I was really young and I swear by tea tree oil. Put it on a cotton ball and soak it whenever I think about it. Esp if I feel that tingling before it actually shows up. Cuts the duration a TON
3832 2018-12-12 17:10:34 I remember that! It was a river parade, lol.
3833 2018-12-12 17:10:27 It’s not our war. We need to stop intervening every time there is a conflict. Sanctions will only drive up the price of oil. Alyssa can pay for what ever she wants with her millions.

3844 2018-12-12 17:09:46 raising the gas tax is a completely effective way to "target the oil companies." a way you can confirm this to be true is that oil companies desperately lobby against gas tax increases
3845 2018-12-12 17:09:31 Pep natures young players I am sure mancity must have atleast two three world class youngsters in academy . NO ? 

Oh no .. signing two three more players . Oil money needs to spent too right ? Okay .

3847 2018-12-12 17:09:12 I'll be watching, with some cardboard under the telly in case of oil leaks!
3848 2018-12-12 17:09:10 Yeah, am sure he also meant Bitumen, just a little mix up.
3849 2018-12-12 17:09:06 Why don't you go on and sneak out then, try for that life of luxury in another country. See if anyone misses you. You little scrotehair.

3854 2018-12-12 17:08:46 What on earth is this Olive Oil looking dimwit talking about? @AnnCoulter
3855 2018-12-12 17:08:46 Oh dear. Yeah... that's vile. Thankfully it seems less bad when its on their raw. Esp if given on a day when they also get recreational bones. But yesterday was fish oil day soooooo
3856 2018-12-12 17:08:46 I happen to live in Québec and I support 100% Alberta. If we are not for Alberta then who is? But the bigger question that comes to mind; would an AB seperation make the oil flow more to neighbouring provinces or less?
3857 2018-12-12 17:08:21 But no, it's not feasible to expropriate gas stations. What you can do is target them to get them shut down thus making it more difficult to get gas and reduce driving. Or we could target oil production. But no, everyone wants a gas tax because it's easy to target the poor.
3858 2018-12-12 17:08:18 @realDonaldTrump 
Look I understand where you are going with this whole “more oil”. It’s for the well-being of our country. But us humans can adapt so well. We went centuries without fossil fuels, we can do it again. Animals aren’t as lucky. Leave their home alone.

3859 2018-12-12 17:08:17 kleveru jojoba oil
3860 2018-12-12 17:08:13 Difference today is that Government in Power is committed to solving man-made climate change by destroying oil and gas business as soon as possible, and will accept nothing less as UN disciples. Climate change hysteria has rooted itself, is ridiculous, + will destroy the country.
3861 2018-12-12 17:08:10 大学に行かないと読めないので明日です！ありがとうございます！
3862 2018-12-12 17:08:09 I agree. I had hernia surgery last year. Thought I would handle the pain with Doc prescribed marijuana oil. Not! Couldn't get the opiates in me fast enough. Didn't move for the first 3 days. They helped a lot. But I only got 4 days worth then Tylenol 3's. All good now.
3863 2018-12-12 17:08:02 Well, isnt that what’s being done?  Flip the problem 180 - a group has proposed stopping all pipeline projects.  Do they do consultations? Economic assessments?  Even environmental reviews as oil moves other ways or from other sources? Nope. They have a lower bar to meet.
3864 2018-12-12 17:07:49 The scent of lemon oil is super calming! Get something to roll that on your wrists and neck before you get on the plane!

3868 2018-12-12 17:07:27 Last week Kirsty Blackman @KirstySNP told Westiminster that SNP policy was to maximise extraction from the North Sea and that the oil industry needed another big handout. So - why are you more worried about a symbolic gesture?
3869 2018-12-12 17:07:27 I love Cantu Shea Butter for Natural hair , Cantu shampoo, Sheer Butter Daily oil Moisturizer  & Sheer butter leave in conditioning repair cream Cos they keep my natural hair masturized & healthy and easy to manage #ClicksChristmasWrapped 
3870 2018-12-12 17:07:26 Looks real good do u use beard oil
3871 2018-12-12 17:07:26 Meanwhile the Premiere had sent out a working group to oil execs to attempt to get a consensus from them on the best approach.  Since she couldn't get one, she was forced to make the call she had to with the best info at the time.
3872 2018-12-12 17:07:25 I like them back in the day but now if I smell any of that it makes me sick. That and the PINK body sprays. But perfume in general gives me migraines and makes me sick. The only thing that doesn’t is Egyptian musk body oil lol
3873 2018-12-12 17:07:23 Doubt it Will 
3874 2018-12-12 17:07:18 Is it all part of the master plan for Trump to increase US oil production and press on OPEC to lower prices to help Putin?
3875 2018-12-12 17:07:16 Y not run pipes from the ocean into California forests near residential areas that can be turned on like sprinklers when theirs a fire? I mean we can build a pipeline across the entire continent for oil...but we can't build water infrastructure that saves lives.  deserves more!
3876 2018-12-12 17:07:13 “I understand that AB & the other provinces that produce oil want to find ways to get it (to tidewater), but I was very, very clear,” Francois Legault told reporters after the meeting. “There is no social acceptability for a pipeline that would pass through QC territory.”
3877 2018-12-12 17:07:12 Man city ? How are they relevant spurs are the ones were talking about and for city they just simply and frankly bought the league and trying to buy the champions league too becuz they nothing without arab money and oil being pumped into the eithad, however city are just amazing
3878 2018-12-12 17:07:11 Yeah but you forget something is that US customs take into account the oil when it leaves the port even on a reverse lightering vessel. So maybe a VLCC did not leave but the oil that is being used to fill it on a lightering vessel may have been included in the numbers.
3879 2018-12-12 17:07:07 I'm almost out of my yoga essential oil blends 
3880 2018-12-12 17:07:06 Ruler just by gun isn't worth it... Do u know how UK had named the queen... She made it the best for them until they introduce voting and something democracy... How did ghadafi rule lybia... How is lybia now?... He could at least secure their oil now American determines the price
3881 2018-12-12 17:06:59 I’ve slept on beard oil for way too long. Most everybody I know that has good facial hair always recommends it. I gotta get on board

3885 2018-12-12 17:06:50 Iran would be a far better ally than Saudi Arabi if we could just get over the 1980 hostage crisis. It’s more democratic, far larger, and will be a power in the region long after SA runs out of oil.
3886 2018-12-12 17:06:42 It's called the New Madrid fault line. It's caused two of the largest earthquakes in US history, way back before we even used oil.
3887 2018-12-12 17:06:32 It means
Production is more and more important than oil.

That is unless thier funding has already been written off by Big Motor & Big Oil.
3895 2018-12-12 17:05:46 Yeah I’m gonna do it! Just need to grab some canvas and some oil paints on sale after Christmas! 
3896 2018-12-12 17:05:44 Rep. Joe Kennedy III owns between $500,000-$1,000,000 worth of stock in Exxon Mobil. But I'm sure, if elected, he'll protect the environment and not Big Oil.
3897 2018-12-12 17:05:34 @LynneQuarmby you really think it's that easy to go without oil. Turn in your grad certificate. Everything we use has some type of oil produces in it. You all say stop using gas engines in cars. So what do we use for other 90% of the car that uses oil byproducts in it.
3898 2018-12-12 17:05:34 I hear they’re paying $30 to have another man change their oil for them too
3899 2018-12-12 17:05:26 Ahhh yes! I love rose hip oil. Thank you

I am reliably told that KSA and UAE are expanding output capacity like crazy as we tweet.
3902 2018-12-12 17:04:54 It's my pleasure, learning more...
3903 2018-12-12 17:04:43 Rose hip oil for a moisturizer super hydrating & doesn't leave your skin oily. Especially good for this time of year if you have dry skin!
3904 2018-12-12 17:04:30 It is better to regard them as different, because when you use one particular standard to evaluate like AASHTO, they are all chemically not the same
3905 2018-12-12 17:04:10 Lead them from temptation, make them royalty... everything we facing make us question it.. lead us to salvation.. pour that oil please.. that’s how we become kings & queens

3911 2018-12-12 17:03:32 Last week Kirsty Blackman @KirstySNP told Westiminster that SNP policy was to maximise extraction from the North Sea and that the oil industry needed another big handout. So - why do you still support the SNP? Like the @scotgp , you have no real principles.
3912 2018-12-12 17:03:28 The only country that rivals the US in PPP, the real measure of population wealth is Norway- a homogeneous country of less than 10 million with huge oil reserves. And, the US has the most progressive tax regime out of all the OECD countries. It’s not even close.Nice try though.
3913 2018-12-12 17:03:28 Hi there! There is no black pepper in the black beans or pinto beans, but there is in the slow-marinated chicken. Sunflower oil is used in both as well. Hope this helps!
3914 2018-12-12 17:03:28 I finally got my oil changed 
3915 2018-12-12 17:03:16 as soon as my brain can actively remember that game and watch is capable of absorbing projectiles and using oil panic it's OVER for you bitches.
3916 2018-12-12 17:03:13 Had to take a long lunch to get an oil change before I drive to family this weekend, but nope dont get to eat. No microwave at the dealership....taking longer lunch once I get back to work and can use the microwave...
3917 2018-12-12 17:02:59 LOL confession I had NO issue with the newspaper chicken, but high key that's a really good way to get rid of the excess oil. *fades to black*
3918 2018-12-12 17:02:45 My mom made some bbq chicken tenders last night them things was superrrr oil oilll

3921 2018-12-12 17:02:41 Also, she stands up to Oil.  The nerve!
3922 2018-12-12 17:02:41 I just need a sugar daddy to pay for gas and my oil changes.

3928 2018-12-12 17:02:15 The next will be North West, North Central and South West commissions. Nonsense! When the oil eventually dries up, all these commissions should source their funds from Lake Chad Basin oil wells.
3929 2018-12-12 17:02:12 Macros have only gotten better today. All local events - assembly election results, RBI gov resignation and new appointment has been factored in. Indian markets likely to follow global markets now. Bigger concern is crude oil. 9000-9100 Nifty is still a possibility.
3930 2018-12-12 17:02:10 lol you're telling ME to TRY palm oil, been eating it my whole life
3931 2018-12-12 17:02:01 Think that depends on how you count revenue from oil and gas.  More than just royalties. Income in alberta is significantly from oil and gas - directly and indirectly.  

The pipelines the feds bought (they bought an operating system) is profitable too.
3932 2018-12-12 17:01:59 May nees the Scottish oil
3933 2018-12-12 17:01:40 Yeah exactly, that is a Bitumen, it is very dark/black in colour with a melted plastic appearance with in liquid state, a byproduct or product from petroleum
3934 2018-12-12 17:01:30 Yea, while so are same but referred to as diff names by AASHTO , CCP and BS .
3935 2018-12-12 17:01:22 I was giving mine fish oil for a while and...yeah, it does horrible horrible things to their breath. They're on a different liquid supplement now because of the stench that accompanies cat barf when the cat has consumed fish oil (Keegan sometimes eats too fast and then barfs...)
3936 2018-12-12 17:01:19 Agreed, apparently the later Yeltsin years were a chaotic nightmare (fertile conditions for an authoritarian to rise).

The Ukraine has a lot resources (including oil) but I suspect President Putin is inspired more by machismo and nostalgia for the USSR (he laments its fall).
3937 2018-12-12 17:01:00 people who put oil in the pan to cook bacon are extra as fuck
3938 2018-12-12 17:00:56 Mitch loves him some oil money.

3949 2018-12-12 17:00:23 Content is the new oil and social media helps in bringing awareness about the brand through it.Use it judiciously by rolling out quality rather than quantity.
#qualitycontent #qualityoverquantity #brandrecognition #brandimage #buildingbrand #contentisking #contentisoil
3950 2018-12-12 17:00:19 We finally have no reliance on foreign oil for once , zero credit given to Trump . Lower gas at the pumps brings an appetite for local Democrats to tax it , yet again !? Highest gas tax in the nation in Illinois
3951 2018-12-12 17:00:18 This little girl wants coconut oil lip gloss for Christmas. #Christmas2018
3952 2018-12-12 17:00:17 And the fourth one was more than offset by the phenomenal growth in oil revenues that happened before the three year decline.  #nlpoli
3953 2018-12-12 17:00:11 Cool! The oil droplet is straight forward to make.
3954 2018-12-12 17:00:03 It's a good thing you have the oil industry to help you get around everyday and make a living, and also so you can have a mobile phone and computer that you can hide behind and insult people so easily, that differ from your political opinions. #potcallingthekettleblack
3955 2018-12-12 17:00:03 Dare we hope this is the beginning of the end of unsustainable Palm Oil production ?
3956 2018-12-12 16:59:55 Well, personally I'd refine bitumen by expanding Sturgeon Lake, but not allow oil sands expansion until all current capacity is being refined in northern Alberta. Alberta needs to control its product by selling 100% refined product. But I get that isn't the E&P business plan.
3957 2018-12-12 16:59:49 Lmao every time I do an oil change my heart is always beating, if I leave without spending more than $200 it is a win
3958 2018-12-12 16:59:32 All these you mentioned above are Technical different from each other. But not everyone is aware...
3959 2018-12-12 16:59:29 hope you like the smell of pizza oil
3960 2018-12-12 16:59:28 Can we stop all this nonsense about #albertaseparation? We'd be landlocked & responsible for funding everything ourselves. Considering that OPEC has no qualms about manipulating the price of oil to our detriment, exactly how would that work? Canada isn't perfect; neither is AB.
3961 2018-12-12 16:59:26 all these plugs got the same brass-knuckles cartridges, hopefully they know them shits come with fake oil sometimes lol
3962 2018-12-12 16:59:06 If anyone needs any photos, recording, mixing, oil changed, brakes replaced or anything really let me know. Going to be without a paycheck for about a month and could really use the help so let me know.

3964 2018-12-12 16:58:57 For 2nd month in a row, #USA is the world’s largest #oil producer. After we kill off the #saudi weapons-buying economy, can we kill off our own weapons-selling economy?
3965 2018-12-12 16:58:46 I dropped my carb cap on my favorite Nike joggers and stained it with oil. Good morning
3966 2018-12-12 16:58:45 @Asad_Umar Time to do Big and bold things. Time to collect taxes from the wealthy. Time to lower the rates on everyday commodities, reduce oil and gas prices. Time to provide better conditions for the masses, Not the other way around AND Time to be Decisive
3967 2018-12-12 16:58:45 We once used it during felting on a decking, the edge sha. To avoid vegetation and dampness.
3968 2018-12-12 16:58:40 There's actually a YouTube channel that already did the baby oil. I think it actually worked iirc

3970 2018-12-12 16:58:28 No I’m pretty accurate in my tweet. When businesses heard “Trudeau” they knew it was going to be bad. When Trudeau was gaining support the oil industry began to decline.
3971 2018-12-12 16:58:24 Can I bring my pickup in for an oil change
3972 2018-12-12 16:58:16 Are cbd oil and tinctures available for recreational use?
3973 2018-12-12 16:58:13 Another butthurt permabull with no snake oil left to sell.
3974 2018-12-12 16:58:11 @NatGeo your Mars series is only leftist propaganda. You have spent most of he series preaching that oil and corporations are evil, while government is great and should be worshiped. Oil doesn't cause wars and diseases.
3975 2018-12-12 16:58:06 US are trying to stop a 10 year old agreement which is not in the EU 's interest and yet USA will be buying Russian gas and oil
3976 2018-12-12 16:57:25 maybe they want to sue oil companies
3977 2018-12-12 16:57:24 It could pass for a felt, yeah. But Asphalt Concrete pavement as is often called is another name for a Flexible pavement, which is utilized mainly for roads, airport ways and the likes.
3978 2018-12-12 16:57:12 You know ppl mix the British and american name, like macadam, coal tar , asphalt, bitumen.
3979 2018-12-12 16:57:10 As soon as electric cars are as financially accessible as a used gasoline vehicle and, hey, isn't oil used in the production of electricity? Why yes it is! We wouldn't have a modern world without oil.
3980 2018-12-12 16:57:05 My mouth hurts so bad after getting a new wire & wearing rubber bands. I’m out here rubbing CBD oil on my gums
3981 2018-12-12 16:57:04 What's trending for Christmas gifts here at Rich Designs Home?  Exquisite boxes adorned with shells, faux fur throws, scents and candles for the home, art-just sold a floral oil and a floral watercolor...and, the ever popular lotions and soaps...
3982 2018-12-12 16:56:59 We have oil.
3983 2018-12-12 16:56:48 Just tried an Illuminating oil and I look like if Cleopatra’s maid got into her make up. #makeupfail #myfaceisgold

3986 2018-12-12 16:56:14 Looks they will be drilling for oil my friend....
3987 2018-12-12 16:56:12 Wait, where's the evidence that it contributed to that oil price drop?
3988 2018-12-12 16:56:07 I am always dehydrated due to flights so I always run in overnight when I’m home to help restore. I also use a humidifier/oil diffuser which you might like

3990 2018-12-12 16:55:52 apply olive oil stops the bleeding directly
3991 2018-12-12 16:55:43 If you don't speak up for what you want you'll never get it, the wheel that squeak's gets the oil 
3992 2018-12-12 16:55:41 Okay, I have two faves for shampoo/conditioner: Lush solid shampoo (I like Honey I Washed My Hair and Jason and the Argon Oil), and my most recent fave, Prose, the one that constructs a product for you via an online quiz.
3993 2018-12-12 16:55:40 Totally agree with you Brett- but I call them "Environmental" Wacko's. Why are all these Indian Tribes against our oil industry, does the line go thru their reserves???
3994 2018-12-12 16:55:39 My car still reeks like the guy who pulled my car around after my oil change and tire rotation. 
3995 2018-12-12 16:55:34 But that and black caster oil ahaha
3996 2018-12-12 16:55:28 Just like every govt killing innocent men, women and children everywhere and also invade other countries for Gold Oil and Drugs. Who also kidnap kids for human trafficking. They even poisoned are food with GMOS.
3997 2018-12-12 16:55:15 Berlin should think about energy security, especially that oil and gas pipelines are a geo-strategical and  a geopolitical game that might have an unaffordable cost. What do you think doctor?
3998 2018-12-12 16:55:13 @SolitaNQ are the skin on fries fried in the same oil as anything else? I.e. anything that contains gluten?
3999 2018-12-12 16:55:12 I just like dis man..wish u d best
4000 2018-12-12 16:55:05 I always get my car oil changed while I’m at work  I’m quick to tell my coworker Hey follow me to drop my car off real quick lol
4001 2018-12-12 16:54:59 THREATS-IMPACTS-HUMAN INFLUENCE
How do humans influence this biome?
      Hunting, help protect from poachers, drill for oil
How can we help w/ these impacts?
       Less pollution, make it illegal to drill for oil, stricter logging and       poaching laws
4002 2018-12-12 16:54:46 The challenges are true but 2019 is poised for  intro of IPP's & extensive investment in renewable energy; biggest draw back is increased oil prices dat impact cost of everything incl std of living in SA.  @elonmusk & #Tesla #Solarcity #boringcompany can play a significant role.
4003 2018-12-12 16:54:45 They will never accept reality. They will just move on to the next snake oil salesman promising all will be well after the people rise up and revolutuon.

If so yes, if not no.
4006 2018-12-12 16:54:31 Only cuz I like it soft, so I spoon the hot oil over the yolk but never flip it.
4007 2018-12-12 16:54:30 The oil & gas sector is a national sector with benefits to the national economy, representing 10% of GDP. That government purchased a pipeline for the nation, is not an achievement or indicative of intent, but, of being backed into a corner due to mishandling of the energy file.
4008 2018-12-12 16:54:28 @Bill_Morneau Stop all Equalization payments to Quebec. NO pipelines NO Equalization payments. It's simple. But Quebec can biuld a concrete plant in gaspe bay without any environmental review. And it's dirtier than the Oil Sands. But It's Quebec. The West will leave confederation
4009 2018-12-12 16:54:25 I still say the key to China foreign policy gains is it straight from their Treasury department and little care about shared values, etc.  They just simply trade with everyone and seem to not care if the barrel of oil comes from Saudia Arabia, Iran or Valenzuela.
4010 2018-12-12 16:54:17 On dirait les jambes de oil King 
4011 2018-12-12 16:54:16 Half the food we eat is fake so why not just drink oil and eat cash?
4012 2018-12-12 16:53:56 i swear  i’m like i’m just here to get an oil change please leave me alone sir
4013 2018-12-12 16:53:54 Why are 90's kids so nostalgic about stupid shit? 

"remember when twist ties were made with paper instead of plastic? where my 90's babies at?! kids these days will never understand smh" 

More like "Remember when we invaded the Middle East under the ruse of WMD's to steal oil?"
4014 2018-12-12 16:53:49 Still researching more though... The names can easily be mistaken for each other, but different constituents and mix design...

4016 2018-12-12 16:53:44 I have been using it as a salad green for the last few weeks, along with arugula, kale and a bit of parsley. I do the whole salad chopped with nuts, feta, tomato, avocado, cranberry, lots of olive oil and balsamic. I find the chard gives some nice bulk and "heft" to the greens.
4017 2018-12-12 16:53:34 Prussia I made a stick and let’s get virgin olive oil comes from???
4018 2018-12-12 16:53:33 I’m not blaming vegans for anything. How do you know I’m not one? And have found another cheap vegan oil? I said there is other alternatives. And to get educated on it. But as soon as you go to slander it’s clear you can’t have proper discussions. All the best !
4019 2018-12-12 16:53:33 Cohen's attorney said his client, @MichaelCohen212, had "misfortune" of being Trump's counsel. Please. It was one snake oil peddler working for another. They were drawn to each other.

4022 2018-12-12 16:53:06 Eh.. Cina, is the single country in the world to take out of the ground and use most fossil fuels. Russia is another of the main producers of oil; Venezuela's economy was based on oil..

So yes if you are ignorant, socialist&communist countries definitely do not rely on oil.
4023 2018-12-12 16:53:02 isme mirchi aur oil bahoot hai ye ap hi khao

4025 2018-12-12 16:52:51 It's the carpet, plastic, vinyl, and sound deadener that typically does it. A bit of engine oil smell, but there's like10ft of vinyl headliner in there and about an acre of other various petroleum products, it very much has that old car smell, tho one that's been kept okay.
4026 2018-12-12 16:52:49 Was minging then we I was sick I rubbed my eyes with the finger a just used to put the clove oil on fair to say I’m not partially blind
4027 2018-12-12 16:52:47 I was interested too!  I don't think  people even have the faintest idea how much of our lives involve the use of oil and gas products.  We all need to make some major changes.  Posting positive solutions is a really good start.

4031 2018-12-12 16:52:29 From cruising the Deltas in Alabama during the Oil Spill......to North Dakota on the Prairies helping to bring oil to production.....The OIL life has treated me well.

4033 2018-12-12 16:52:10 I swear you go to the car shop for an oil change and suddenly you need a whole new car

4035 2018-12-12 16:51:58 The people laughing at Trump's climate policy, obviously don't have money, because smart money in liberal Mandela backyard are ALL backing offshore OIL exploration.
4036 2018-12-12 16:51:55 Lol  or or coconut oil and shea butter and coconut oil
4037 2018-12-12 16:51:52 Thanks 
I do oil paintings of robots doing different things , they just make me smile. And yeah, not having a boss is worth all of the hard work 
4038 2018-12-12 16:51:47 Am unaware of any social unrest the oil industry has brought to Tanzania, other than that ts a good educative article.
4039 2018-12-12 16:51:39 After a fun replacement of my oil cap this morning I’m finally back to motoring. #HolidayRoad is never boring. Next stop, St. Louis.
4040 2018-12-12 16:51:35 Because of how the right denied climate change for decades, things will be worse. This is the fault of all politicians that took money from big oil and did nothing for decades.
4041 2018-12-12 16:51:28 Do u really understand the meaning of status quo?
4042 2018-12-12 16:51:23 Ya, who needs oil? It's only central to the production of your food, clothing, transportation, housing and all the neat little tech devices that we've all become addicted to. Educate yourself before spouting a holier than thou proclamation.
4043 2018-12-12 16:51:18 Bitumen , hot mixed or cut back

4045 2018-12-12 16:51:00 The Old Boys Club. These antiques are trying to make world stop in their white, paternalistic era....take good look. Gas , oil, mining, racism, bigotry, homophobia all wrapped in flag and religion. Turn of the LAST century.  The KIDS are coming.
4046 2018-12-12 16:50:49 I dream of opening Mass Mess for the needy in nuke and corner of the country serving just Rice , Dal and boiled vegetables without oil and using bio gas  or fire wood in contemporary kitchens.
4047 2018-12-12 16:50:49 Nah it do I just got my oil changed after almost 9 months  and my shit ride better

4052 2018-12-12 16:50:30 Gonna drink a gallon of CBD oil
4053 2018-12-12 16:50:29 Yea I meant bitumen
4054 2018-12-12 16:50:24 i think we all interpret it differently. it might mean complete transformation; 50% is a lot. but maybe 50% less energy use is not so bad. we all think about it differently, but for me it means an oil company must go out of business right now. and the rest must change or go.
4055 2018-12-12 16:50:08 It won’t happen as long as there’s oil in the Niger Delta. Let’s not forget a certain tribe from the south who don’t mind being dominated by Hausa-Fulani in exchange for government appointments.
4056 2018-12-12 16:50:01 웹툰 멋진 연출..세로로 긴 컷을 최대한 활용한 화려한 일러스트 스타일을 위주로 그리면 얼추 된다고 생각중..
4057 2018-12-12 16:49:52 Being impressed that someone broke the box office record for "Event cinema concert production" is like being impressed that someone set the world record for "Fastest time climbing a lightpost while covered in crude oil while in Slovakia." Lots of competition I'm sure
4058 2018-12-12 16:49:44 @tvcnewsng government should use excess crude money to pay the outstanding oil subsidies
4059 2018-12-12 16:49:40 That is Bitumen... Structural anti damp or sealant. Not as an entire Asphalt Concrete
4060 2018-12-12 16:49:37 Gurl thats wat they do. I b like listen I only want my oil changed thanks! 
4061 2018-12-12 16:49:30 After years of stealing oil money that could have made this country better, we now have to diversify the economy as the government cannot fund Education and Health adequately. It is really sad, we aren't as productive as we should.
4062 2018-12-12 16:49:27 The 150 billion was also Iran's money & WE did not give it to them. The money was held in foreign banks from the sale of THEIR oil. When the US lifted sanctions, they got THEIR money. You stupid or you lie. Which one?
4063 2018-12-12 16:49:24 うう、調べても拡張ハバード模型とか出てきてよくわかんないでござるぅ。物性はなにも分からないので嫌いでおじゃる。
4064 2018-12-12 16:49:23 Who can take you seriously when you make ignorant statements like this? Sanctions, undercutting Russia's economic leverage with our own gas & oil, standing with Ukraine....way better than a reset button that says 'overcharged'.
4065 2018-12-12 16:49:13 killing orangutans is not quite vegan lol. imo you can eat it & be vegan but really if you can avoid it you really should. buying things with sustainable palm oil is good because it shows demand for it!
4066 2018-12-12 16:49:07 They break in 2 minutes because your probably not adding the proper amount of oil an water before driving it

4069 2018-12-12 16:48:54 Just to clarify this is nothing against the rest of the guys I think they are all far more competent musicians than oil is a singer, however I think the fan base lives and dies with that attitude and personality oil has always brought to the band

4085 2018-12-12 16:47:57 palm oil production kills orangutans due to deforestation. i don’t think it’s not vegan per se, i just think we, as vegans, should be doing what we can to avoid it.
4086 2018-12-12 16:47:49 I don’t think it does! It’s like a very thick oil. Slightly slightly sweet.

4118 2018-12-12 16:45:03 there is no more time for this kind of questions, the remaining oil should stay in the ground and we have to switch to renewables in ordr to survive as a specie.

4120 2018-12-12 16:45:00 With 37m under threat of #famine and the very real threat of #cholera in #Yemen perhaps you should withdraw any and all offers of aid to KSA incl. oil + importantly the arms you seem hell bent on selling them.

Nigeria o!!!

The butterfly!
4207 2018-12-12 16:37:20 Lol yup, same, but provide you dry them off, and put a few drops of oil on, or they will be too dry, be good.
4208 2018-12-12 16:36:52 Hemp oil. -clears throat- Or so I hear.
4209 2018-12-12 16:36:49 Ok. Black hemp oil!! Anyone know where I can get it??
4210 2018-12-12 16:36:47 Don’t mind equalization. I do mind the province that benefits the most saying there is no social acceptance for Alberta oil.
4211 2018-12-12 16:36:46 Curious. I wonder if she has received campaign contributions (aka bribes) from WSPA & other big oil interests?
4212 2018-12-12 16:36:38 Do you specialize in oil?
4213 2018-12-12 16:36:37 Washington State ... another Democratic voter fraud state

$3.40

So the Dems say big oil is in bed with Republicans? Why is it big oil thrives off local Democratic governments with gas tax and kickbacks?
4214 2018-12-12 16:36:35 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
4215 2018-12-12 16:36:33 Global argan oil market size was estimated at over 3 kilo tons in 2015. Increase in natural products demand from regions such as North America and Europe has prompted morocco government to raise production to 10 kilo tons by 2020 with creating new chain of modern argan farms.
4216 2018-12-12 16:36:12 Love our 100% organic eco bamboo cloths ..... These soft gorgeous cloths are teamed with our organic cleansing oil for the ultimate cleansing night time ritual 
4217 2018-12-12 16:36:02 No, they're idiots. California has the highest poverty rate in the US, and it's the world's largest CO2 emitter. Their oil has TWICE the CO2 content of AB's bitumen.
Oh, and ask them what happened to the Natives there. 
Get a clue.
4218 2018-12-12 16:35:53 The rush to get into #ANGS is on
4219 2018-12-12 16:35:52 Always and forever. Rose oil face moisturizer, rose oil body oil, Aquaphor on feet.
4220 2018-12-12 16:35:48 Just got my oil changed and they had Trump Cult News on in the waiting room. My wife and I were laughing hysterically at all the lies, such as "Schumer was looking like a little boy going into the principal's office" and "Trump really schooled them." Nothing but blatant cult lies
4221 2018-12-12 16:35:47 태왕님 갠봇 생기면 진짜 반해서 고백하면 어쩌지???100퍼 차일듯
4222 2018-12-12 16:35:26 Because west never wants us to unite,typical example is when muslim nations controlled oil prices  and exports in the beginning and then how U.S engineered the secterianism in muslim nations and then devastation are infront of u which are going till date.
4223 2018-12-12 16:35:14 I don't see how a hour-long Banksy is less "art" than a eight-hour oil painting. The individual viewing defines that and as it stand they played 12 oil paintings to get to the Banksy's.
4224 2018-12-12 16:34:59 Peppermint oil.....hmmm...might have to try that
4225 2018-12-12 16:34:55 Burn midnight oil again because of project. TT
4226 2018-12-12 16:34:51 Nah, you need to take any political science class my guy. You don’t seem to understand world geopolitical...or world economists...or the how oil prices work. 

And your rejecting of globalized economics is just plain uneducated man.
4227 2018-12-12 16:34:51 Coconut oil add company karan apdi panirpano
4228 2018-12-12 16:34:48 I get it sa restos pero sa street food di na bagay sa overused oil and stuff.
4229 2018-12-12 16:34:44 Well mate, t h that was my final test, the big one, "real" chips... drop of oil, sprinkle with smoked paprika... 20 mins at 200, shake once... absolutly perfect.. only gripe, mines very smal, wish I had got the larger one.
4230 2018-12-12 16:34:37 Hot drinks. (Not milky ones). Hot water bottle. Oil of Peppermint Capsules help me. Make sure you’re eating little and often - empty tummies cramp. Wishing you better.
4231 2018-12-12 16:34:34 just set up an oil change at the toyota dealership, tell me why the customer service guy said “love you bye” at the end of the call
4232 2018-12-12 16:34:16 He also laid out political economy of extraction; fruit, gold, pine nuts in FATA. Low rates, Punjab traders, no Markaz to enrich locals.
4233 2018-12-12 16:34:15 New energy is the most important thing we can do to prepare for the  Grand Solar Minimum that is Coming. In 2009 Nasa released a Patent for a  new energy that would free us from oil. Zawodny said that this is  Disruptive Tech. The Current Global Power structure does not want this
4234 2018-12-12 16:34:08 MoveOn need to do some basic research to realize Beto is deeply indebted to Big Oil and several other corporate donors. Walk the walk Beto, without owing the corrupters.
4235 2018-12-12 16:34:06 Who can add oil to my car like rn ?
4236 2018-12-12 16:33:53 Fieros were fire traps. They had a recall for fires back in the day.  The cause was oil leaking into the exhaust. Good ‘ole GM!
4237 2018-12-12 16:33:47 Its OK ...hota hyy ... Shah g se na milny ka itna gham tha ...k me b salin me oil dalna bhool gay thy jab Ami NY pocha k oil ktna dala tb yad aya k dala hi nahi 
4238 2018-12-12 16:33:44 I'm thinking about all the activities I could do at that oil resort.
4239 2018-12-12 16:33:41 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S INSIDES
4240 2018-12-12 16:33:36 Sorry dudes it did not gave up. Next 52.5 above closing will result 53+ in next 4 hours highly likely #crudeoil #usoil #oil #oott
4241 2018-12-12 16:33:31 Americans are nuts.
4242 2018-12-12 16:33:30 They didn't give Iran $150 billion. They returned seized assets, it wasn't our money in the first place. I suppose i understand you thinking this way ... the guy who wondered why we didn't take the oil when we went into Iraq
4243 2018-12-12 16:33:27 เขินนะะะ
4244 2018-12-12 16:32:56 Alberta, already unable to sell the oil it has, wants to build another oil refinery. Brilliant decarbonized futures thinking. @KeepCanWorking #Alberta #COP24
4245 2018-12-12 16:32:56 I reached the mixing baby oil with lotion point in moisturizing
4246 2018-12-12 16:32:56 Probably those r business deals disguised as donations .. ril is into oil refinery .. US & Saudi's control most of the oil supply .. shd any1 b surprised by these donations .. I am surprised u r actually thinking of it as NGO donation
4247 2018-12-12 16:32:53 Trump assumed because Tillerson had a relationship with Putin because of oil he was willing to throwaway his life for millions more? Dude was already a multimillionaire
4248 2018-12-12 16:32:53 This girl on Facebook is arguing with me saying to exfoliate with SUGAR and moisturize with coconut oil.... I gtg
4249 2018-12-12 16:32:50 Kerry Fire Service are attending to an oil spillage extending from Basin Road to Ballymullen Roundabout in Tralee.
4250 2018-12-12 16:32:31 I have not gotten a flu shot once in my adult life. I take oil of oregano (the liquid form, 3 drops under the tongue each morning), a multivitamin, and the occasional probiotic. Know how many times I've gotten the flu in the last 10 years? ZERO.
4251 2018-12-12 16:32:21 うおお………。レアいチェキになってしまったかもな

4254 2018-12-12 16:31:55 Oh, you’re into holiday fragrances? I like the aromatherapy stress relief one. I’ve been hooked for a couple years now, oil blocks, wall plug ins, lotion & pillow spray
4255 2018-12-12 16:31:48 Ummm we just locked up the #CFO of the second largest phone company in the world as a favour to another countries falsely applied sanction, just so it can sell its own oil. Isn't that like the kettle calling the tea pot black?
4256 2018-12-12 16:31:44 Asked by a young man whether he agreed with the rumour connecting a member of the Zardari family with Naqeeb, Rao Anwar’s victim.
4257 2018-12-12 16:31:41 I’m getting some glasses today, an oil change, maybe a new tire and painting my bathroom..can you guess?
4258 2018-12-12 16:31:23 Muddy buddy, grapeseed oil, terbaik!
4259 2018-12-12 16:31:10 Red onion; charred rosa tomatoes; plain feta; avo; cucumber and baby butter lettuces and watercress. Steak 

Salad dressing: two parts olive oil; 4 parts orange juice. Smoked chillis flakes. S&P
4260 2018-12-12 16:31:05 I wish I could snap my fingers and my hair be hot oil treated , washed , deep conditioned , detangled, moisturized , & flat twisted for this wig.
4261 2018-12-12 16:30:59 If find myself in Texas not only am I working on cell towers I’m putting my hands on some oil rigs
4262 2018-12-12 16:30:57 Yep says the company that thinks water is a commodity not a birthright,like the royals think its their birthright if these ppl cared so much we would be piping water around the world(greening deserts etc) Instead of oil(cellulose) and promoting closed loop self sustaining living

4264 2018-12-12 16:30:55 Now if you can just process the lipids for use as oil in your car, you'll have it made!
4265 2018-12-12 16:30:46 Hey girly have you tried natural Teatree oil? It did wonders for me! I would use it once a day with a face moisturizer with no alcohol twice a day!
4266 2018-12-12 16:30:44 Do we know if fuel supplied by oil retailers meets the standards it is supposed to. @CSEINDIA why dont you check this.
4267 2018-12-12 16:30:41 Funny, Trump seems to think if we freeze someone's account that money is "ours".  Just like he thought since we invaded Iraq their oil was "ours".  That's the mindset of a conman and a thief.
4268 2018-12-12 16:30:35 That was bloody brilliant, was glued to it. 
Well done everyone and may we all become millionaires

4271 2018-12-12 16:30:28 not a foundation recommendation bc i’m looking too but i always put milk makeup hydrating oil on before any concealer/foundation and it helps keep my skin a lot less dry especially in the winter (i have combo skin)
4272 2018-12-12 16:30:17 US | EIA Crude Oil Stocks Change  for december: -1208000.0 (Cons: -2990000.0, Prev: -7323000.0)
4273 2018-12-12 16:30:02 Since cows & pigs turn agricultural waste into food for human consumption, replacing them will require huge amounts of forest land being converted to crop land to replace the lost calories. This would be a reversal of the recent trend in higher agriculture yields from less land.
4274 2018-12-12 16:30:01 몰라 이제..자야지...
4275 2018-12-12 16:29:59 Marinol also contains seseme oil and we know that means people with allergies aren't able to use that - but they can use natural cannabis and get the same result...as has been done for 1000's of years. Home grown cannabis has kept me alive - given a death prognosis in 2010.
4276 2018-12-12 16:29:57 I’m about to look up natural remedies. As of now just hot tea w/lemon, honey and coconut oil.
4277 2018-12-12 16:29:43 3) The final thing is i love contrasts of textures. Shred and spread onto a baking sheet and place under a broiler for a few minutes. Boston butt is pretty fatty so the excess oil should do a good job of crisping the top of your pulled pork like a reverse deep fry.
4278 2018-12-12 16:29:35 Ok, peace.
4279 2018-12-12 16:29:14 Then maybe take your issues with the "implications" to Beto, bc he's the one who signed the damn pledge. And these people don't "arguably" work in oil, at least 30 donations were the max $2700 from oil company executives. Shit dude did you read this article?
4280 2018-12-12 16:29:06 There was NO US payment to Iran.  The $150 billion was IRANIAN money from oil sales held in foreign accounts, which Iran got access to.  THERE WAS NO $150 BILLION "PAYMENT" TO IRAN. WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THIS????
4281 2018-12-12 16:29:03 Well what did he expect oil royalties down and income tax collected down plus people are paying down debt instead of spending money with rising interest rates.
4282 2018-12-12 16:28:51 Agha Waqar can bring the most Great revelation in human history. The whole world can change, international capital systems can be DISTROY. No oil need in this world. Just imagine. This is the first time so pls rise voice for this man before to late.
4283 2018-12-12 16:28:47 Experience oil&gas mmg 
4284 2018-12-12 16:28:29 Why do people put baby oil on themselves in the sauna ? Is there something I’m missing ?
4285 2018-12-12 16:28:27 Bourbon glaze is a perrrrfect use! Try it with salmon, too. Goes well with sesame oil/seeds.
4286 2018-12-12 16:28:23 Niether of them have done anything to help AB. As for Notley give your head a shake. She has/had anti oil activities on payroll & now months before an election wants us to believe she's doing something. Both shut down AB as planned.
4287 2018-12-12 16:28:21 Umm I use coconut oil mixed with Cantu curling activator and Maui curl smoothie all together after I shower and rag up, make sure you brush in the shower, and ziploc bag your hair with your palms to lay down the hair nice waves swim afterwards!
4288 2018-12-12 16:28:19 I have a... friend... looking for an essential oil that will help children sleep. Something similar to chloroform, but all natural and less illegal. DM me if you know of something...
4289 2018-12-12 16:28:19 Because nuclear rollback, moderate stability, a somewhat reliable ally, oil source and important country in the region is worth nothing.
It wasn't even US money. But hell if you'd understand that.
4290 2018-12-12 16:28:16 This man can bring the most Great revelation in human history. The whole world can change, international capital systems can be DISTROY. No oil need in this world. Just imagine. This is the first time so pls rise voice for this man before to late.
4291 2018-12-12 16:28:13 I have used Marinol and I can tell you it is terrible compared to natural cannabis oil. If you are treating nausea you need a sativa Terpene profile and when you have isolated synthetic THC you don't get the full benefit. Quick tolerance too so not effective as changing strains!
4292 2018-12-12 16:27:57 I think he was a snake oil salesman in a previous life - traveling the west in a colored wagon selling "miracle water" from town to town - yelling and preaching, warning people how much they need it" knowing all along it's a total scam as he collects the dollars. That's Al Gore.
4293 2018-12-12 16:27:56 Assignment equity dah siap. Pastuuuu, kena repair skettttt. Lets Burn the midnight oil.
4294 2018-12-12 16:27:55 Cabal oil does not get that way. This oil is obtained from the armors. It is the same fuel of your vehicles.
4295 2018-12-12 16:27:55 Salad has always been one of my favorite foods but like my most recent obsession is spinach salad with goat cheese, walnuts and a garlic herb oil dressing 
4296 2018-12-12 16:27:51 Love Argan Oil! Makes my hair so nice @abbynaverysmom @Summrluver @Ladibug151 @angie_rm22 @mommy3sons
4297 2018-12-12 16:27:45 Im sure they got the oil from the olives in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus cried and sweat blood.
4298 2018-12-12 16:27:38 he added the sales of oil and gaz to the 50 billion 
4299 2018-12-12 16:27:35 Good tweet. Based on more serious info, @Go_Rozen Permian reserves are about 20 billion barrels, not 47 billion barrels and its peak oil production is around here ~3.5/3.7mbd... are you agree with that?
4300 2018-12-12 16:27:29 How would y’all feel about oil carts in frostburg 
4301 2018-12-12 16:27:11 castor oil atee haha lagay mo bago matulogs
4302 2018-12-12 16:27:04 Tempting to nominate my sister who told me she uses water instead of oil in the frying pan  ..
4303 2018-12-12 16:27:04 @HaziiqOthman salam jiq, ada member nak servis kereta myvi. Perodua semi sintetik + oil filter dengan nak check bearing tayar. Nak bincang harga tkboleh dm bosku haha
4304 2018-12-12 16:27:03 To convince people we need to account for all of the negative externalities oil and gas produce. A carbon tax is a way to do that!
4305 2018-12-12 16:26:55 ......
4306 2018-12-12 16:26:54 Is there anything more awkward than sitting in the waiting room at the oil change place? I think not. #wednesdaythoughts
4307 2018-12-12 16:26:39 Bollywood walas gave performances worth crores for free at sangeet as gifts, Politicians might give oil field contracts in their states  as shaguns
4308 2018-12-12 16:26:32 Not a cream but sweet almond oil is really good at fading scars. In my opinion
4309 2018-12-12 16:26:29 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES 
4310 2018-12-12 16:26:28 If you don't burn yourself with hot oil, did you really make it at all?
4311 2018-12-12 16:26:24 Probably Veteran or OIL
4312 2018-12-12 16:26:20 The Consumer Priced Index remained unchanged in November, and dropped from 2.5% to 2.2% YoY due to drop in Oil.  The Core CPI rose 0.2% and it's YoY rose from 2.1% to 2.2%.
4313 2018-12-12 16:26:08 Rod bearings might be going out waiting on oil analysis
4314 2018-12-12 16:26:06 A much more extreme example of how "renewable" does not necessarily mean "sustainable": whale oil.
4315 2018-12-12 16:26:01 Brownie mix + egg + sub butter for oil + a package of cream cheese + a box of instant pudding + optional peppermint. Use a mini muffin pan and underbake them. You'll have individual tiny lava cakes in 20 minutes flat.
4316 2018-12-12 16:26:00 I always laugh when the HRC contact me for donations.
4317 2018-12-12 16:25:52 We can’t get be up Texas, they have oil. Out federal government will never give up oil
4318 2018-12-12 16:25:49 Libs as Anita from West Side story:

 A voter like that
 Who'd give you fredom
 Forget that boy
 You just don't need them
 One of your own kind
 Stick to your own kind (though we don't help you at all)
4319 2018-12-12 16:25:39 Alberta oil is only 50% in.
4320 2018-12-12 16:25:32 What a giant price for revenge! All the oil in the world can't buy respect.
4321 2018-12-12 16:25:31 ちゃんと揃えているのはいいよね。最近はいいかげな人が目立つからなぁ～。
4322 2018-12-12 16:25:23 나 헬스 6개월 끊었는데..6개월 후엔 나도 건강맨 되서 헬스 다녀와도 멀쩡하고 막 그럴 수 있을까
4323 2018-12-12 16:25:15 Irresponsible & unfriendly attitude by the NOC Chairman, government duty is to serve People’s wellbeing & welfare .People of Fezzan can no longer be passive ,watch water & oil flowing under their feet to be mismanaged by incompetent government & wasted by corrupt administration .
4324 2018-12-12 16:25:11 And little L libertarians are usually internally consistent. IE supporting abortion rights and gun rights. Libertarian and Religious Right should be oil and vinegar.
4325 2018-12-12 16:24:54 EIA is Always WRONG. So, lets BUY #Oil
4326 2018-12-12 16:24:47 Not sure why journos granted exit interviews by @JerryBrownGov do not press him on contradictions between his climate-change messaging and his support for natural-gas power plants, his acceptance of millions from fossil fuel interests and his personal holdings in oil and gas
4327 2018-12-12 16:24:42 feeling ko kailangan ko na talaga mag change oil
4328 2018-12-12 16:24:38 Coconut oil 100% stuff tho
4329 2018-12-12 16:24:31 Same. Just don’t fall for the G-Sync snake oil and you’ll be fine
4330 2018-12-12 16:24:23 Pipelines oil refineries will not resolve Alberta’s financial woes
4331 2018-12-12 16:24:20 You're unbelievable now let's attack  hard working oil workers.I know your Tim Hortons job is hard but...Who exactly is benefiting from Alberta's equalization payments? Go look at those stats "sports guy".
4332 2018-12-12 16:24:18 My coworker got me a throw blanket and a couple oil diffusers and I cannot wait to go home and use them 
4333 2018-12-12 16:24:17 Yea I wish I could take CBD oil for my anxiety...might be actually be able to go out without having attacks. Also for my inflammation
4334 2018-12-12 16:24:16 In the current state, there would be no increase. Why would Canada just start allowing Alberta oil to be shipped out just because they become independent?  They don’t want more being shipped now. Independent Alberta would have less leverage than the little bit they currently have
4335 2018-12-12 16:24:03 My coworker said cbd oil didn’t do shit for him, he rubbed the oil all over his knees and it didn’t work 
4336 2018-12-12 16:23:49 "LORD, you provide the flame for my lamp. You, God, turn the darkness around me into light." Psalm 18:28 ERV God will fan the flame but you must fill your lamp with the oil! #WednesdayWisdom
4337 2018-12-12 16:23:47 I have been using coconut oil every 2-3 days. I might have to ramp it up. I also use my spray bottle mixture of water, conditioner and sunflower oil to moisturize it every few days. My scalp is soaking it up!

4339 2018-12-12 16:23:39 @leavetheherd Any idea if the great Manchester Coconut oil shortage of 2018 is at an end? Quite fancy a black hoof tomorrow but its been about 5 weeks now
4340 2018-12-12 16:23:37 Sitting in the Firestone lobby. I, too, am unable to muster sufficient argument. Though I have gotten MUCH better about getting my oil changed.
4341 2018-12-12 16:23:31 any mommies use coconut oil on their babies hair? Royale lil bald spot in back is a NO NO

4344 2018-12-12 16:23:06 Where is the logical end to this? Does it just continue until they have a new fad? Or will the rest of the world be at the beck and call to a fundamentally corrupt ruling caste until we ditch oil?
4345 2018-12-12 16:23:05 Getting my oil changed n this mf take synthetic oil I’m pissed  I thought I was getting the 25 dollar oil change 
4346 2018-12-12 16:23:03 More neoliberalism isn't the answer, John. When #HousingIsARight you build to house people; when housing is a commodity, you build to make money, which introduces all kinds of incentives for builders cartels (dev'pt industry) to restrict supply to keep prices high. Housing ≠oil.
4347 2018-12-12 16:23:02 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
4348 2018-12-12 16:23:00 Remember to rub a little bit of peppermint oil on your arms and legs to repel those mosquitoes when you go to bed tonight.
4349 2018-12-12 16:22:44 Y’all bitches spend hundreds of dollars on makeup but then ask me to basically give you essential oil products which are actually beneficial for your health lol, not that skin care isn’t important but just keep that same energy
4350 2018-12-12 16:22:43 I guess the only acceptable oil is saudi, angolan, venezuelan, american... not the "dirty albertan oil"... paid for with transfer payments no less... good job quebec! WOW! wake up people
4351 2018-12-12 16:22:42 hopefully your BOR isn't full of special interest wackadoos who will sacrifice the goal of becoming a tier 1 research institution for oil kickbacks & cut a ton of jobs!!

4352 2018-12-12 16:22:40 He seemed to have other mental problems.All moms saying is it damages developing brains. Probably true. I dont think anyone is trying2make weed legal so kids can start smoking it when they're 12. Should a kids parents be able to buy Cbd oil so they dont have seizures?Absolutely.
4353 2018-12-12 16:22:32 بس على طاري اللخمه اتذكر في عزاء جدي الله يرحمه المهم كان ليل والمطبخ يخوف شوي وكان مره ضايق صدري من اشياء كثير المهم مالك بالطويله رحت عشان اجيب لي ملعقة للرز جيبي لي ومدري ايش المهم عقب وقفه طويله عند درج الملاعق خذيت لي شوكه ورجعت وكلت فيها بعد وكل هذا صاير وانا مفهيه
4354 2018-12-12 16:22:28 On that note, I'm going to poke my nose in here with.... wait for it...... a suggestion. Have you looked into CBD oil? It helps me sleep and I have a restless mind for sure.

4357 2018-12-12 16:22:18 Next time you style your hair after wetting it use a leave in (optional), a styling cream and an oil (something like Jamaican black castor oil, jojoba, almond, etc) to seal it all in. Bc you’re in a colder climate I recommend a heavier oil to seal. Hope this helps 
4358 2018-12-12 16:22:07 Does Pemex/Mexico import a lot of oil from Ecuador?
4359 2018-12-12 16:22:02 So @ontarioisproud - which corporations will be funding your activities for next year's federal election? Oil and gas? Bay street? More developers? Organized crime? Why don't you come clean now and save us all a lot of trouble? #ONPoli #CDNPoli
4360 2018-12-12 16:22:00 Have you tried an oil for you scalp?
4361 2018-12-12 16:21:51 I make sure the water it's cooked in is seasoned. I sautéed some onions, peppers, and garlic in olive oil. Add water, season salt(Goya), then the quinoa. I sometimes add various types peas (beans) or mixed vegetables to it to make a quinoa medley.
4362 2018-12-12 16:21:50 Yes, Russi's been punished for its commitment to JCPOA by replacing the lack of Iran oil in the market. What a severe punishment
4363 2018-12-12 16:21:47 put caster oil on them and it’ll help them grow faster 
4364 2018-12-12 16:21:43 Have you tried lightly applying a oil?
4365 2018-12-12 16:21:37 I don't think anyone is saying we can make the change overnight. But when are we going to take the first step?? Building more pipelines and subsidizing the oil industry just further undermines any attempt to move away from it.
4366 2018-12-12 16:21:31 “now we’re cookin with peanut oil”
4367 2018-12-12 16:21:23 Gonna ask for oil for Christmas so I can sell it back to the libs when the economy collapses
4368 2018-12-12 16:21:21 Right...because climate researchers make so much more money than oil executives...

4373 2018-12-12 16:20:54 Begging is not due to poverty but begging is a business. Putting oil in Oilly head is the motto & profession of ministerial hierarchy but the Symbiotic relationship between RBI(Central Bank)-Govt(people) can never be denied. One should think before he leaps

4380 2018-12-12 16:20:35 Fox thumbs and squirrel oil....lol
4381 2018-12-12 16:20:28 The @scotgov claims to be a world-leader on #environment, and there's much to justify that. But it cannot claim to be taking #climatechange sufficiently seriously unless it shifts decisively away from an oil economy and makes just transition a priority. #ExtinctionRebellion
4382 2018-12-12 16:20:18 I much prefer the company of conservatives than liberals. With liberals I feel like a stage prop at best, and I'm pretty sure they'd turn rabid if I failed to fulfill that role. (And I'm a hick too, so I'm not the brand of gays they're partial to anyway.)
4383 2018-12-12 16:20:09 I love old oil bottles and a 10/22
4384 2018-12-12 16:20:06 And the value of the oil that Iran sold once sanctions were lifted was valued at...
4385 2018-12-12 16:19:52 Yeah she is a lot like a far right wing former head of the cia who lied us into an oil war.  Why do you think that appeals to you?
4386 2018-12-12 16:19:38 Cantu Argan oil leave in, everything carols daughter and coconut oil for softness and shine
4387 2018-12-12 16:19:32 Yes cannabis is just a crop like wheat, a commodity. Price will be set by the market just like other commodities. If there is too much supply the price will go down, just like wheat and oil. And also... oh wow $3 million that equates to $36 million per year. Not even close to oil
4388 2018-12-12 16:19:07 My favourite word. But before Welsh Christmas? Not a week after the great oil change strike of old Calgary town?
4389 2018-12-12 16:19:06 I love my @VeggieGrill but this is high fat/oil vegan junk food! I hope you're eating much healthier meals, with lots of greens and no oil.

4394 2018-12-12 16:18:44 Separatism talk is literally the reason Qc has endured so much love loss over the years. AB voters need to realize that most Canadians support levelling the playing field, supporting oil jobs lost. This isn’t lost on us not living there, keep the scare tactics for prov politics

4399 2018-12-12 16:18:03 Trump, you are a paranoid snake oil salesman, trying to accomplish a ridiculous campaign promise!  Reform immigration policy and stop the wall madness!  
4400 2018-12-12 16:18:02 Is it reasonable to expect the subsequent executive to check his own power? Isn’t that a bit like putting oil companies in charge of regulating oil spills? 
How do you create accountability in these cases?
4401 2018-12-12 16:17:58 Oil rich countries are buying influence and soft power through the game and nothing is going to change
4402 2018-12-12 16:17:56 On the show...no on offered free weed to us...but...they did offer free CBD oil products. Which was nice, because since filming, I have continued to buy it.

4404 2018-12-12 16:17:46 - use olive oil/castor oil/almond oil 
in a bowel, pour a decent amount of any of these oils, dip your nails there for 15 minutes and then remove them. don’t wash it off, let them dry naturally.
4405 2018-12-12 16:17:46 "it's mostly unsaturated so it's good for me" I say as I chug a gallon of olive oil
4406 2018-12-12 16:17:45 They recently found a shitload of oil there.
4407 2018-12-12 16:17:40 How about investing in solar in a land like Iraq for good of your people and save oil for export $$.

4409 2018-12-12 16:17:21 Margarine is solid vegetable oil I hate this craze that's going around that's basically saying "Fat is fine as long as it's vegetable fat" like if that was the case then why are french fries bad for you they're fried in vegetable oil fucking dumbass trend-diet pieces of shit
4410 2018-12-12 16:17:21 Explain to me how tarriffs imposed by us to Mexico= us paying the tarriffs?  That's a good one!  Omg
4411 2018-12-12 16:17:16 Please study a bit of what your iPhone & Macs are made. Yep, the one which you use for tweeting. #oil products. Don't buy = don't use; be consistent with yourselves
4412 2018-12-12 16:17:06 Moving towards a time when oil is used mostly for lubrication and making plastic. ICE going the way of film photography and land lines. $TSLA is ahead and still not taken seriously.
4413 2018-12-12 16:17:03 Better: you get to have sex, and make a few bucks! 
On paper, sounds great. Just ignore the inconvenience of reality.
4414 2018-12-12 16:16:58 Hey!! What seems to be the problem. Quebec needs to buy more overseas oil. With our money. This is and will be the Trudeau legacy.
4415 2018-12-12 16:16:58 N'est-ce pas Mr le Président @EmmanuelMacron ?
Not a single word about climate or ecology in your last speech.
You should listen to @GretaThunberg instead of the #CAC40's firms...
Meanwhile, our house is still burning (and you're adding oil in the flames)
4416 2018-12-12 16:16:56 Sorry . Put enough oil and tomato paste
4417 2018-12-12 16:16:50 ATTAbotics “was a power point presentation” two years ago. It now has 115 employees, most former oil and gas industry workers. Company has 60 job openings right now.
4418 2018-12-12 16:16:49 Now I want to see an all Beefed up stream. Beef shades, beef socks, beef mousepad, beef beard oil. Did I miss anything?
4419 2018-12-12 16:16:44 Interest rates are too high. The Fed raised them too much too fast.  With Oil and Gas at very low prices, the life blood of the economy is flowing freely and at low cost. This frees up consumer dollars as well as business dollars to spend on other things.
4420 2018-12-12 16:16:38 おつかれ！！おやすみ
4421 2018-12-12 16:16:28 You know....when the BP oil spill happened and obama refused help from the top of the line ships from Scandinavian countries built for such a disaster, I knew something was terribly wrong

4423 2018-12-12 16:16:21 I got firm hands & I sure know how to apply oil.
4424 2018-12-12 16:16:18 Swedes disagree. Also, how many technologies they invent? IKEA? You want to be stuck in the past, be stuck yourself. Also, living off oil money isn't exactly long term solution. Plus scandivian countries are simply spending what capitalism has earned throughout decades.
4425 2018-12-12 16:16:07 And huge move in oil prices. :/
4426 2018-12-12 16:16:04 Do not boycott palm oil. Consumers: Buy certified stuff! Producers: Tell it as it is! #Sayitonthewrapper 
The problem right now, from the viewpoint of the consumer : can you find any products with a declaration of ingredients on the wrapper that says "RSPO" or "certified"?

4431 2018-12-12 16:15:51 Well it was their money so there's that. It also seems that your party may be the only ones that think keeping status quo is good.  Didn't you give a whole lot of exemptions to countries buying their Oil?  That's another great move if the point t is to cripple them economically.

4450 2018-12-12 16:13:49 That’s good news. I understand hemp oil is also being considered. So we need land to grow soy, hemp and food to provide the world’s needs.

4469 2018-12-12 16:11:25 If you have a good food processor it’s really easy to make your own. Just peanuts, coconut oil for creaminess, and liquid Splenda to taste.
4470 2018-12-12 16:11:11 Some plastic is. Guess you didn't hear that Toyota and Honda are moving to soy based plastics. Times they are a changing. Bottom line, no oil for fuel will mean a vastly reduced market for it.
4471 2018-12-12 16:11:09 Probably that close to your city is either a franking facility place or they are taking oil from the earth or water, so the liquids that stabilise the soil is being taken away so it moves. Facts of modern life!! We as humanity, are awful, and we damage Earth :(
4472 2018-12-12 16:10:57 Mostly tames my T-zone area so I don't look like I'm dipped in oil in the sun

4474 2018-12-12 16:10:43 $UWT remember when oil used to cost money ?
4475 2018-12-12 16:10:40 بس يا احياناً تصير اشياء تصدم ! يعني عزاء وابوه توه ميت وفي ناس تفكر كذا ؟
4476 2018-12-12 16:10:40 Obviously a take on fracking, the injections of water or nitrogen into the earth to release oil and or gas to the surface, where greedy oil barrons and politicians chomp it up.
4477 2018-12-12 16:10:31 Don’t make others fool.... oil import bill is deferred.....

4480 2018-12-12 16:10:08 No need to name call or be sarcastic. I was seriously asking you to answer the question regarding how our country or the world for that matter stop using oil and petrochemicals overnight. I was actually interested in your thoughts on whatthe solution is. Fake news? I don’t get it
4481 2018-12-12 16:10:07 Why does the rest of Canada have to inject Quebec with funds to purchase oil from overseas. This is a slap in the face to Alberta who funds the majority of provincial equalization transfers. Just not right. No pipeline no money. Get with the game Notley!!!

4486 2018-12-12 16:09:43 Also,  they didn't impose tarriffs,  we did.  And when you're a country losing billions of dollars a year with Mexico like we were,  in a trade deficit, any tarriff increase is a surplus to us.  Duh!

4488 2018-12-12 16:09:20 Actual evidence can be gleaned by looking at the Alaska permanent fund which pays all Alaskans a stipend via investment income from state oil revenues—and there’s no evidence that it had any impact on unemployment at all.
4489 2018-12-12 16:09:20 Most of the reason Oil price has fallen is due to strong shale production. Capex cut first offshore. Business does appear to have made good progress. Clearly oil always difficult but now an interesting juncture given balance sheet valuation and progress.
4490 2018-12-12 16:09:15 Media pushed by big oil tries the meme that there is such a thing as too low for oil prices.
We reached peak oil last year. Cost too much to drill. Profit=0. Oligarchs continue to put money into extraction refusing to see electrics here.
4491 2018-12-12 16:09:11 "The oil production fluctuates, to diverse the economy it is important to depend on alternative sources of revenue to attract foreign investors." #chinakwt #crossculturaldiwaniya #ccdkw

4499 2018-12-12 16:08:16 I don't deny that. When inflation rises or falls rates should move to adjust for rising or falling prices. When inflation is starting to roll over (Oil crashes/ CRB 1yr lows) raising rates to have room to cut makes no sense. It inflicts the damage you are trying to protect from

4515 2018-12-12 16:06:41 OPEC said they were cutting, and the oil market was up for a minute but then sold off. Now there is an inventory draw and the market is up. Will it sell off again? I've got my finger read to make an adjustment. Just waiting to see if this is real or no.
4516 2018-12-12 16:06:31 somebody hide the oil from her ugh
4517 2018-12-12 16:06:30 Good but why is it America First for every industry except the independent US oil industry, producers, and workers? Your Iran exemptions are crushing the price, us, and oil independence, and driving sales to Russia, our Saudi “allies”, et ilk.

4520 2018-12-12 16:06:25 ING Bank 1/3: Headline inflation in the US has slowed to 2.2% YoY, but this reflects a $25/bbl  plunge in oil prices since October. Strip this out and “core” inflation  is up and will continue grinding higher as spare capacity in the  economy shrinks.

4528 2018-12-12 16:05:19 I think you should direct your complaint to @tedcruz If you remember he owns Deadspin now. 
No Deadspin, we haven't forgotten you getting owned by Ted freaking Cruz. It makes me smile to this day.

4531 2018-12-12 16:05:07 Just keep fracking, this will happen more often than you think! Thank your President and his roll back of regulations for Power, Gas, Oil, etc...
4532 2018-12-12 16:05:00 Is CI a backwards-looking thing? Oil's relationship with 5-yr ave inventories? Seems like the Market doesn't care that inventory relative to fwd demand is really low, and is pricing based on Art's CI metrics ...
4533 2018-12-12 16:04:52 We've always bought the imports,  but now their taxes have been raised,  where as before,  we didn't have that additional revenue from them in our coffers.
4534 2018-12-12 16:04:49 What is @PMOIndia  doing for these? 

Improving JOBS

Middle class Tax benefits - Home loan Tax deduction,  

Higher Free Income tax limit etc
Lower GST taxes
Benefits for Hindus
Tax deductions-Hindus
Cheaper Fuel , Lower Oil
Stronger Rupee

4542 2018-12-12 16:04:17 Exactly. It's a bloody debacle. The margins on the new line were going to be razor thin at $60 oil. I can't imagine anyone at BDC telling cabinet this was a smart decision. They should've just let it die, really.
4543 2018-12-12 16:04:14 Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia guarantees cheap oil and gas prices for Americans in North Dakota, Indiana, California and New York.

France is being burned to the ground because Macron is NOT AT ALL concerned with the VERY HIGH price French people pay for gasoline.
4544 2018-12-12 16:04:02 Thanks

we need a LOT more of this; eg, does anyone on twitter know how Northern industrialists (Pew/sun oil) worked with Southern racists to stop labor organizing in the South ?

4572 2018-12-12 16:02:24 The price of oil dropped, however the government know there is far more diesel vehicles out there ! Imagine dropping 12p a litre would lose the government per day !! Conspiracy as refining fuel is done in the same procedure just different temperatures so why the big difference

4593 2018-12-12 16:00:37 It absolutely did. If you look at those who hold real power in this country, the DuPonts, the Rockefeller’s, etc that had an impact. Add in the oil barrons that evolved from the cotton kings and you see our issues pretty well

''We earn billions of dollars from oil but the money goes back into subsidy (or whatever this government has decided to call it), so we keep borrowing to finance our budget. This is not an argument against subsidy — it is more of politics than economics''
4600 2018-12-12 15:59:58 good news at last,lets hope it keeps it,s word but we need to be careful what we buy as palm oil is a lot of products.
4601 2018-12-12 15:59:55 My eyes have seen a world with very little in the way of possessions. I’m fine with returning to the simplicity. I am most concerned about our dependence on Saudi Oil and the unfairness of the equalization program in Canada. As long as we use oil, why not our own?

4609 2018-12-12 15:58:37 Since playing Fallout I keep seeing random crap and thinking, I should chop it up for the equivalent value of units of timber, oil, cloth, iron etc. to be less of an eyesore.
4610 2018-12-12 15:58:31 @Heid_oil Just got your DM...unfollowed.
4611 2018-12-12 15:58:25 Don't ever base an intraday oil trade solely on API or EIA storage reports (unless you're an expert scalper). #STUDY
4612 2018-12-12 15:58:24 I guess it’s the US Shale oil exposure that the market doesn’t like, going to be the first place that capex gets cut after recent oil price drop...if it can be FCF +ve in current oil market & drops close to cash levels will start to look interesting
4613 2018-12-12 15:58:23 Taylor Energy company had an oil spill that occured in 2004 and oil is still leaking till now that's crazy
4614 2018-12-12 15:58:18 This was dinner last night.  2 Chicken breasts cooked in the crock pot with olive oil and garlic. Then I shredded it up,  added chicken stock and frozen organic sweet peas. (Organic really do taste better) and then tossed with spaghetti and locatelli Romano. Easy and delicious!
4615 2018-12-12 15:58:18 I cleaned around my stovetop this morning. Then immediately fried something in a pan, splattering oil everywhere again. #typical #whybothercleaning
4616 2018-12-12 15:58:16 Because there's no city in Malaysia nor Singapore that we commonly use to represent them.
Besides, Dubai became the seat of UAE's economic growth after the discovery of oil.
That's why most people say they're in Dubai but they may be in other cities or towns in UAE.
4617 2018-12-12 15:58:14 They look at the past not at the future big green economy. Not sell oil but solar electricity* directly in all world market

4621 2018-12-12 15:57:56 I kept the seed in one half and covered it with olive oil, sealed in an airtight container.

Watch this mdc thing still go turn brown on me.
4622 2018-12-12 15:57:47 OIL 1H ALL of the pulling back up higher off 200MA test during EIA volatilty is nothing more than good entry for short move. 1D still testing 20MA & should move down to put in  DOUBLE BOTTOM through next week. Ultimately it is RANGE TRADE up and down. Scalping?
4623 2018-12-12 15:57:46 Trans fats like in hydrogenated oil aren't good for anyone, they are artificially produced and have strongly been linked to cancer and are banned in many countries now thankfully. Saturated fats are a quite different story.
4624 2018-12-12 15:57:32 Face it Huckster Chuck, the only reason you want open borders is for the the survival of Democratic Party.  Your party needs new voters. The snake oil sale you’re selling has lost its appeal.

4626 2018-12-12 15:57:22 Do not boycott palm oil. Consumers: Buy certified stuff! Producers: Tell it as it is! #Sayitonthewrapper 
The problem right now, from the viewpoint of the consumer : can you find any products with a declaration of ingredients on the wrapper that says "RSPO" or "certified"?
4627 2018-12-12 15:57:18 Squeaky wheel gets the oil... Call Telus and tell them you're moving unless you get a deal... I did that with Shaw and they upgraded my router, internet speed and gave me more channels and cut by monthly fees by 30% just by getting a 2 year contract.

4635 2018-12-12 15:56:20 its just behind world oil filling station in ilasan lekki. the living room is massive. you could come check it out yourself but i will send you pictures for the mean time.
4636 2018-12-12 15:56:17 Nice to know vegans are against animal cruelty, but obviously not against the deforestation the growing of palm oil creates.
4637 2018-12-12 15:56:16 it may be an oil paint 
4638 2018-12-12 15:55:57 Impossible. When you burn carbon compounds, carbon is released into the atmosphere. I understand GM is moving to build only electric vehicles, with little to no emissions. They don't run on oil products. Same goes for Volvo, Ford, and many other car manufacturers.
4639 2018-12-12 15:55:57 Oil companies are better lobbyists than kindergarteners. How's that for a dubious honour?
4640 2018-12-12 15:55:56 @OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg are u reading this. Oil is bye bye, what are ur plans for the future
4641 2018-12-12 15:55:52 Guess who hasn’t washed,packed, gotten an oil change, or cleaned the car out? I leave tonight tho.
4642 2018-12-12 15:55:47 I want it but my bank account wants something way cheaper  I wanted some of that Indian hair oil, Amla, but the way those prices are set up... I'll stick to hair conditioner and a tub of coconut oil
4643 2018-12-12 15:55:42 They're stealing that from the NYT. They ran that piece earlier this year when they had a love-fest over communism's anniversary.
4644 2018-12-12 15:55:20 Morning! I’m gonna get some of your products today I need coconut oil!
4645 2018-12-12 15:55:17 Oil Pumpinggggg...
4646 2018-12-12 15:55:16 That's meant for his uneducated 'base'. Such a blatant lie.

Few weeks ago, he touted oil prices in a tweet - He used Lowest price of WTI and highest price of Brent crude.   The non-uneducated knows Brent is always higher than WTI.
4647 2018-12-12 15:55:13 What I do when I'm that bad is get some eucalyptus episom salts or essential oil (you can add mintoor lavender too just because sometimes only eucalyptus can be too much in it's own) and put it in a big pot of boiling water. Throw a towel over your head and it and do it in bursts

4652 2018-12-12 15:54:15 Thanks, realize you don't know my background. I'm not a crazy macho guy. I support strong women. My Grandma ran an oil/gas co from 1929-1960. After she was widowed. It became Texaco. She was highly respected in mans world barely 5 ft tall. Drove oil tankers.
4653 2018-12-12 15:54:14 What if we used the 1000s of miles of oil pipelines to divert sea water from rising seas to desalination plants and piped the water to drought affected areas?  #climatechange @DroughtGov @drought_in_cali @CAN_mass @Ocasio2018 @GlblCtzn @DrDCWahl @billmckibben @Biocharro

4656 2018-12-12 15:54:06 We’re criticizing your Alberta government they’re not an oil business
4657 2018-12-12 15:54:03 You're right, we probably cant live totally without oil. But, we can significantly reduce our footprint and move in another direction to new options. It's like diversifying
4658 2018-12-12 15:53:55 แซ่บ ชอบบบบ
4659 2018-12-12 15:53:54 Are we supposed to get rid of Trump for whom? Beto O'Rourke who raised and spent more $ from oil/gas corps than TED CRUZ? What "progressive" policy would Beto support? "Access" to healthcare? He hasn't said word about ending the permawar.
4660 2018-12-12 15:53:50 Sorry. I thought you could read. I said "Obama signed into law". Of course you wouldn't know when. You right wingers were focused on tearing him down. Look at the chart I posted from the Dept of Energy. It shows when oil prductn overtook imports, even without drilling public land
4661 2018-12-12 15:53:45 I want to do that I’m oil in my hands up
4662 2018-12-12 15:53:33 One doesn't have to dig deep when it comes to Cult45. You are garden variety followers of a pretty average Cult leader with pretty average snake oil, sorcery and dumbfuckery.
4663 2018-12-12 15:53:31 I'm not taking sides. I'm telling you what happened. The U.S. agreed to release back to Iran their money that we impounded. It's that simple. What they choose to do with it is up to them, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it. As someone once said, shit happens.
4664 2018-12-12 15:53:21 But we can also talk about the type of oil that Quebec does import from foreign sources, and the carbon footprint the production of, say, Nigerian oil has. With modern SAGD methods, Alberta OILSANDS oil is very, very clean by comparison. Not that facts matter for Jill.
4665 2018-12-12 15:53:20 I did have a teaspoon of cod liver oil last night though to be honest with y'all.
4666 2018-12-12 15:53:12 I have some items such as rice, oil  to distribute this Xmas. I'm targeting those that really need it preferably those in the slums. Please who knows any in here in Lagos.

4667 2018-12-12 15:53:09 Perhaps a tad too much CBD oil....
4668 2018-12-12 15:53:08 People like Titov may seem like unpopular rivals to Putin, but they are really just in competition for his ears. They like sanctions and low oil, it raises their isolationist USSR 2.0 stock slightly. The "liberals" are connected to oil sales. Putin has Rosgvardia either way.
4669 2018-12-12 15:53:06 Murder is Murder

4672 2018-12-12 15:53:01 It should have been done in the 70s or 80s but there was never any money forthcoming for anything of this magnitude north of the border, not even for the oil capital of Europe! The A96 should also have been done, from Inverness to Aberdeen.
4673 2018-12-12 15:53:00 I was referring to using the oil to break down the makeup product and remove it with a baby wipe before washing your face. I do it every day. 
4674 2018-12-12 15:52:59 As for the false choice... we do NOT need to choose between a strict no-oil money candidate and an top oil money recipient. Beto is at the top of the list, and MOST Democrats take less oil money than he does.

4677 2018-12-12 15:52:37 Yes, burning fossil fuel is affecting the earth’s ability to sustain our form of life. I understand the #ffi is working hard to refine oil into products with little to no emissions.
4678 2018-12-12 15:52:28 I want to drop my car off for an oil change once without them calling me to tell me 100 things need to be done and my cars falling apart
4679 2018-12-12 15:52:27 and btw that fwd thinking is exactly what Norway did in 1975 by setting up a sovereign wealth fund from the oil just discovered in the north sea. Govts shud look 50yrs ahead but 5years. short termism is the enemy of business.

4683 2018-12-12 15:52:13 You talk about other people being dense when you are politically retrograde Mercury in a oil slick mixed with Marmite in a blanket of fog dense yourself. You might fool the gaggle of old boys down your local but you aren't fooling anybody else other than yourself.
4684 2018-12-12 15:52:10 Absolutely. I just imagine oil producers could not be happier to see the left joining in on bashing essential climate solutions. Even Bernie supports a carbon tax. Now, you need to cushion the blow of it, so it doesn't hurt those who can't afford it. But a carbon tax is crucial.
4685 2018-12-12 15:51:56 bold defense of oil extraction here
4686 2018-12-12 15:51:40 You do realize for the first time in 70 years we export more oil than we now get from foreign countries???  We are more independent than ever as a nation.... it’s part of draining the swamp...

4698 2018-12-12 15:50:50 Companies in all sectors began to collapse due to exorbitant overhead cause by oil/gas prices. ONLY THEN, when people started losing their jobs, and could not pay their mortgages, did the housing bubble burst.
4699 2018-12-12 15:50:40 You want to hear needlessly rude? He's a giant asshole for dragging his daughter into court in a blatant ploy for sympathy.

4703 2018-12-12 15:50:16 Labelling a single criterion as a “purity test” is using the “slippery slope” fallacy. “If we rule out people that take big money from oil executives, what will we rule out next? Next thing you know, we wont have ANY viable candidates! ”

4706 2018-12-12 15:50:08 Agreed, for her to launch an undeserved war because she lied about weapons of mass destruction just for oil, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people.... oh that wasn’t her was it.

They could care less about the future.  Its massively depressing but that's what America has become.  We aren't "great again" at all.
4713 2018-12-12 15:49:23 BUT - FIRST need to get inter-provincial trade sorted.  You noted (?) the Premiers didn't talk much about it at the Conference - with any honesty and enthusiam.

4728 2018-12-12 15:48:29 Firstly, we’ve been diversifying since the first Trudeau ruined oil and gas the first time. Secondly, easy fix, let’s cancel the Equalization. What each province makes, they keep. You’d never hear another word from us.

4733 2018-12-12 15:48:12 
4734 2018-12-12 15:48:09 2/2..about the distance being regulated that they must stay away from the giant dolphin Orcas, affecting their livelihood. Vancouvers Port is not remotely like the deep water open oil ports in southern US. Even Kitimat is scary. 
4735 2018-12-12 15:48:07 Shit is crazy every guy on the east selling pre rolls / oil cartridges and every female doing micro blading
4736 2018-12-12 15:48:06 Does it now? Tell him to go F'k himself, as we know how law works and what it doesn't work for is arresting someone due to YOUR unfair or pissy pants #Sanctions due solely because you want the world share of market place oil.

4739 2018-12-12 15:47:58 When your body encounters processed sugar it is like "Awesome. store it here..." Then send a command to look for some oil. It always stores the sugar and looks for oil above basic maintenance. Once you find oil .. it says "Awesome. Okay stop searching/eating I have what I need."
4740 2018-12-12 15:47:57 It is about more than “just” oil. It’s currently mainly about Welfare and how can the East suck the Alberta  Bank dry, while not even allowing us to make any! Always has been. Always will be. Oil? No one gives a  about Alberta Oil. #ABEXIT

4749 2018-12-12 15:47:21 @TonyMarinaro In regards to your teeth and gums, research 'oil pulling'. You might find it gross, but it could help and save u a few bucks.
4750 2018-12-12 15:47:20 Well Im holding and it is still going up.
Not a hard decision really.
4751 2018-12-12 15:47:11 i use the aveeno brand on all my eczema spots. the baby one is good for my face and i use it like 3 times a day. my brother has it too and he uses 100% coconut oil.
4752 2018-12-12 15:47:11 @kaimirza1987 ....I am with the same view as well. but the same goes if no oil then market should have reacted by now as well and mark down to 6p or sub, so may be hanging in balance right now
4753 2018-12-12 15:47:03 Oil lang naman ng pinag-gisahan ng seafoods yung nalagay sa bread pero grabe naman rashes ko. #allergyagain 
4754 2018-12-12 15:46:44 No issue? Apart from the environment and public health... Oh well, if you are able to ignore all the already outstanding US shale debt, failing drillers, peak oil signals and falling oil prices, you should have gone to Specsavers. 
4755 2018-12-12 15:46:41 It wasn’t cash or gold or dollars. It was not very liquid. A lot of it was in form of swaps, and products that Iran had agreed to receive in return for their oil.
4756 2018-12-12 15:46:33 Ouh tak mungkin sbb engine oil tu kecuali kalau tukar minyak masak. Check angin tayar.
4757 2018-12-12 15:46:29 The only oil crisis is in Canada, entirely caused by a lack of pipeline capacity.  US producers receive WTI pricing in the low $50’s.  Our prices plunged below $10.  This is not caused by an externality.
4758 2018-12-12 15:46:28 The Koch brothers own the oil industry
4759 2018-12-12 15:46:25 It wasn’t in U.S.’s hands, this was the money that other countries (mostly South Korea, India and China) owed Iran for purchasing Iran’s oil. As a result of sanctions, this money was frozen there.
4760 2018-12-12 15:46:20 We are giving money to the wrong people in Quebec. We should be paying off the corrupt longshoremem and the Mafia who depend on foreign oil imports into Montreal.

4771 2018-12-12 15:45:41 Leading cause of death by cancer is lung cancer from smoking. Obesity is a result of eating too much corn based products, foods fried with soybean oil and MSG, not from eating animal proteins. The less high quality proteins in the diet, the more obese.
4772 2018-12-12 15:45:39 During the Middle Ages the coronation was a religious ceremony where a leader from the church, such as the pope or a bishop, crowned the king. Kings were often anointed with holy oil to demonstrate their divine right to rule. #becomingking

She should have said she was trying to be the great, great, great grandmother at the meeting.  How old is she? Are there age limits, maybe 100, for House? @cnbc

4782 2018-12-12 15:44:39 Gov. Snyder has signed the Straits tunnel plan and named his appointments to the commission.  @onetoughnerd says the legislation - which allows  a pipeline housed in a tunnel to send crude oil  under the Straits of Mackinac to go forward - will protect the Great Lakes.
4783 2018-12-12 15:44:38 This exactly what I use too. But I make sure I don’t put too much coconut oil on.

4788 2018-12-12 15:43:56 US was exporting $oil for one week and then it was over, there will soon be lack of oil with the oil price we see now. Trump do Saudi a favour in this way.
4789 2018-12-12 15:43:47 I’m not convinced expanding Canadian refining capacity unblocks political opposition to pipelines. We have pipeline projects being blocked by BC and QC govts despite the fact they deliver Alberta-refined products to BC or expand our ability to refine Alberta oil in Québec and NB.
4790 2018-12-12 15:43:46 Thanks,  ogbeni for the decoding. I just dey wonder say wetin kwacern Agip oil wey don kpeme since.

4805 2018-12-12 15:42:54 Dude, no. Everyone was ticked off by Trump’s parties. Hillary and John Kerry here are attending the wedding of the daughter of an oil tycoon. Party itself screams ultra elite.
4806 2018-12-12 15:42:49 One needs to sit back and be patient...Every algo is now programmed to short oil and slam it down...This will take time to change..Every week there is less and less people long....Just keep on selling OTM calls like me..It is working like a charm.

4822 2018-12-12 15:41:34 Y’all had to grow up in the projects if you think eating spaghetti out of an ice cream container and draining the oil from fried chicken on a newspaper on the counter is normal. And for that I can’t blame you, it’s just what you’re used to. 
4823 2018-12-12 15:41:34 sana oil!

4832 2018-12-12 15:40:34 What keeps getting missed is Sask is in the same boat as Alberta in terms of being pushed out and bullied on oil getting to tide water . It may not be as severe but it is happening . Western separation is becoming a much larger and credible threat to Canada . #sadbuttrue
4833 2018-12-12 15:40:27 Yay, more oil supply! That's what the market's been craving for!

4844 2018-12-12 15:39:39 It depends, priming effects ( Thinking Fast and slow) matter and  the higher the oil prices, the more harsher the economic situation, the better the chances for the Congress.  Hope this dictator who is a threat to our institutions is outsted
4845 2018-12-12 15:39:37 The issue with bitumen is the inability to capture it when it spills in water, it kills fish, the naturally encapsulated carcinogen chems in it that are released with emulsification and the toxic cocktail that is the diluent. Pretty sure NGP would have happened with refined oil.
4846 2018-12-12 15:39:31 A/ $150 billion was RETURNED to Iran (not "given"). Revenues from the sale of oil to American firms.
B/ In exchange for controls on nuclear development which YOUR OWN administration stated the Iranians were respecting.

4849 2018-12-12 15:39:27 It's OK to murder journalists if Trump can make an oil deal with you. It's OK to steal our trade secrets as long as Trump can get his businesses into China. Waiting to see what he gives to North Korea.
4850 2018-12-12 15:38:59 You mean the surviving few of us that didn't die from #netneutrality right?

4852 2018-12-12 15:38:54 Yeah, the new thing seems to be CBD oil and if that works for someone, fantastic. But I know my levels of anxiety and depression and I know how how certain things work and side effects on my own body. It just adds more stress on me.
4853 2018-12-12 15:38:53 One last idea: case studies that might have been in the news where soil plays a big role, like oil spills & their remediation, landslides, dust storms, agricultural practices and food production in general, carbon management, and biodiversity
4854 2018-12-12 15:38:39 If as you say govt opponents in BC and Québec would be more supportive of oil that is or would be upgraded or refined in Canada, then they should support TMX and Energy East. So far, they do not. Nor do they say even more refining would make a difference. This is not the issue.

The Thar mine project is coupled with 4 power plants that will run on indigenous fuel instead of the imported furnace oil, which obviously is more expensive. The coal mine yield will increase as time goes on.
4995 2018-12-12 15:28:07 I can’t eat most fast food because when I was 12 I lived next to a Jack in the Box and was, every morning, assaulted on a physical and spiritual level by the overwhelming smell of used frying oil

4999 2018-12-12 15:27:37 It does however, take about ten years to build a refinery, taking us to 2028. What is the business case for bringing new refineries on line so close to targets for getting off oil? It sure won't help with today's price differential.

His father was a cabinet minister, who suggested one “showers with a friend” to save energy during the oil crisis.

5051 2018-12-12 15:23:46 Lol. Your ABNDP are now suddenly champions for oil, even want subsidies for refineries. You don’t hold a seat and you rely on fossil fuels every day. Bunch of armchair QB’s with no direction or plan.
5052 2018-12-12 15:23:37 It was more like 60 million. It wasn’t 
cash .A lot of it was in form of swaps, products that Iran had agreed to receive in return for their oil. This money was never someone else’s. It was Iran’s .Nobody “gave” Iran 150 billion, they let Iran access her own assets abroad
5053 2018-12-12 15:23:35 It’s a travesty! It all depends it seems who has the money, power, n holds the technology. Used to be an avid reader of “Omni” n other science mags. Hydrogen, solar n electric cars invented, patents bought n quashed by oil. Americans need to stand n demand renewable energy!

5135 2018-12-12 15:17:36 If you’re still lowcarb/keto try coffee with butter and some mct oil, makes it more bearable for me
5136 2018-12-12 15:17:35 @CueVapor- If your sick of other vapes leaking oil in your pocket or anywhere you set it down, then grab a Cue, no leaks, no fuss, no muss. Relax with a Cue for the holidays, VAPING MADE EASY!
5137 2018-12-12 15:17:34 That US figure is field production of crude oil? All liquids? chunky!
5138 2018-12-12 15:17:31 Crude oil inventories up next.
5139 2018-12-12 15:17:27 私もダメになった時はほっとしたのと同時にしんどくていろんな意味でしんどかったですね
旦那はちゃんと話を聞いてくれたり言ったらやってくれるのでとりあえず出てくることになっても少しは安心です
5140 2018-12-12 15:17:17 そうです
5141 2018-12-12 15:17:14 Steam inhalation helps. Add some olbas oil or menthol crystals

5143 2018-12-12 15:17:09 And there is your predictable mistake. Beto isn’t in the pocket of big oil. He has a climate change solution if you would actual do some research. You heard one article about him getting donations from oil individuals (newsflash they can be progressive employees) and you jump.
5144 2018-12-12 15:17:06 @CNN @dcexaminer @DNC @FoxNewsSunday The American people are getting sick & tired of MSM & Democrats attacking Pres. Trump. Not one word of his success's in his two years. Roaring economy, 3.7 unemployment, higher wages, 3-4% GDP, tax cut's, oil independence.
5145 2018-12-12 15:17:03 It's usually with a mix of ghee and coconut oil.  You use an immersion blender to be extra frothy.  It's really not bad.  You aren't just throwing butter in your coffee and stirring it   ;)
5146 2018-12-12 15:17:03 เห็นแบบนี้ค่อยโอเค คงรู้สิว่าเครียดเลยไม่อยากให้เครียดใช่ไหม
5147 2018-12-12 15:17:02 I check to see if I need to replace any of the following :) 
-Rose water facial toner
-Facial cleansing oil with Argan & Coconut Oil
-Lavender salt scrub 
-Jojoba oil :)

5154 2018-12-12 15:16:34 Hey Scott,
I am puzzle as Enbridge ships oil via pipeline daily to oil refineries in PQ. 

I am guessing that since PQ does not directly benefit from east-west is the reason they do not care for it!
5155 2018-12-12 15:16:29 If the burning of fossil fuels is such a great contributor to climate change why do we keep supporting the oil sands. Mind you, it took a while to put health over jobs when we quit supporting asbestos production.
5156 2018-12-12 15:16:28 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
5157 2018-12-12 15:15:59 Aye somebody come get me from the Germantown Volkswagen while I get my oil change and I’ll get both us Waffle House
5158 2018-12-12 15:15:49 Oil needs to go. Each person needs to do their part but rely on government to do so.

5163 2018-12-12 15:15:33 Are you people searching for oil ?

5165 2018-12-12 15:15:22 I don't know how or why this is happening under our watch yet we are buying Saudi oil and sending military equipment.
5166 2018-12-12 15:15:20 Fantastic news. We need to drop dirty palm oil and protect orangutans and other endangered species as well as indigenous populations.
5167 2018-12-12 15:15:19 Wow such a oil baron these days!! Must be an election coming up
5168 2018-12-12 15:15:12 But we could have a temporary seat on the UN Security Council then. Look at the temporary members, indebted to either China or an Oil Prince.
5169 2018-12-12 15:15:09 Corrupt @realDonaldTrump would have kept seized Iranian assets along with Iraqi oil and tried to funnel it into his accounts.  Crooked Don

Map all of its palm oil suppliers
Use satellites to monitor them
Suspend any suppliers that destroy forests
This could change the industry forever and break the link between deforestation and palm oil. save the forests #forest

5176 2018-12-12 15:14:43 Big palm oil corporations (called here "farmers" quite dishonestly) are the only agribusiness that could be compared to the cocaine and opioid industry in the extent of environmental damage, death toll and associated terrorism.

5179 2018-12-12 15:14:09 Olive oil !
5180 2018-12-12 15:14:00 Unfortunately, West and their fear and incompetence is their worst enemy. Russia longest bridge in Europe, Russia best world cup, Russia best oil and fuel service to Europe for over 50 years without problem, Russia world power in atomic energy sector.
5181 2018-12-12 15:13:58 Exactly correct.
The 'big dogs' like Shell, Imperial Oil, Suncor or the newest to the party Parkland would be investing.
We've already done this and it's called Sturgeon Lake. Need I say more?!
5182 2018-12-12 15:13:55 I’m about to slide in someone’s dm saying I got beard oil , reel them in ladies  #MenWithBeards

5184 2018-12-12 15:13:51 Try CBD. You can get it in oil form or gummy form. I prefer the gummies, I tried the oil and the texture for me was horrible.

5188 2018-12-12 15:13:38 @ImranKhanPTI should also instruct audit of recruitment process of #SNGPL and #OGRA 
When you dont recruit on merit you have to face incompetency, dismanagement and corruption in those departments. I urge @ImranKhanPTI to instruct full audit of these oil & gas organizations
5189 2018-12-12 15:13:34 I was at Walmart yesterday waiting for my oil to get changed n it’s like an hour wait so i walked around n bought snacks and came back to share them w the other strangers waiting & nobody wanted any

5191 2018-12-12 15:13:29 I make my own lip scrub with honey, sugar, coffee ground and olive oil! I love it and it smells super yummy! But you can use it on your entire body not just lips! The coffee grounds brightens the face and makes it glow!

5194 2018-12-12 15:13:22 My point is, if the west were to just pull all interest from the middle east, it would not just become some utopia. It would likely get taken over by a foreign power that needs oil, like China or there would just be a giant war btn the Saudis and Iranians.
5195 2018-12-12 15:13:11 Only reason I enjoy getting a oil change is because the man who checks me in is so cute.
5196 2018-12-12 15:13:06 Slide a pan over the flames to smother a grease or oil fire, then turn off the heat and leave the lid in place until the pan cools. Never carry the pan outside. #CookingSafety
5197 2018-12-12 15:13:03 Not so. We still subsidize oil, and we give businesses money for research instead of giving them money because of research.
5198 2018-12-12 15:13:03 What about focusing less on oil and more on other energy resources? I know that so many ABs still think oil is the only answer, but what about the rest of us who want to invest in cleaner energy?
5199 2018-12-12 15:12:50 @NileRed2 Where are you from? Your accent seems Americanish... Like, you say most words the American way, but words like Oil, and a few sentences almost flip to Irish or similar.  Just interesting way of speaking, or something else?
5200 2018-12-12 15:12:50 Except he didn't get all his money from oil...
5201 2018-12-12 15:12:45 I need a oil for this vape but finding niggas is rough. Lol
5202 2018-12-12 15:12:39 Chavez had charismatic and the price of oil was high so he could spend generously.   Chavez died though and the bottom fell out of oil prices leaving Venezuela with less oil revenue to pay for Chavez largesse and it spiraled out of control

-Deported the most Immigrants 

-Takes credit for the mass production of oil which is totally a huge reason for Global Warming 

-Also takes credit for the booming success of Wall Street, which makes the rich more rich

5223 2018-12-12 15:11:00 Why has Alberta not built a oil refinery and sell the finished product to everyone else?
5224 2018-12-12 15:10:58 I’m the old Italian grandma who can cure anything with a clove of garlic and oregano oil. 
5225 2018-12-12 15:10:44 Donde dejan a los "Caterpillar-motor-oil" y los "John-deer"? Tan creativa la gente...
5226 2018-12-12 15:10:32 I don’t think AB would get so much resistance if the bitumen was upgraded to a more refined product before shipping. Refined oil can be cleaned up when spilled in water/rivers/ocean. I hope for AB that refineries are in their future. JOBS. That was Ms.Notley’s promise in 2015.
5227 2018-12-12 15:10:25 A6. But like I stated earlier,  there's still a lot of work and restructuring to be done in virtually every sector. Ours is an economy that is largely dependent on the oil and gas sector and diversification of revenue source to fund #NDCs is paramount. #ClimateWednesday
5228 2018-12-12 15:10:22 More lies from Obama. Snake oil salesmen at best. He is an out of touch, pandering, millionaire trying to sell us a Ferrari that turns out to be a 4-cylinder Yugo. We pay $1400 mo and it doesn’t even cover prescriptions. Worst scam ever forced on Americans

5256 2018-12-12 15:08:23 No, you're wrong TJ. That money was Iran's that they were owed for the purchase of their oil and that money was being held by other countries due to sanctions, not by the US. Even then, they didn't get back all 150, maybe a third at most.

5287 2018-12-12 15:06:35 @RachelNotley Morning blonde. With oil prices as low as 10$ per barrel, do you think a new refinery will fix the crisis! Where are you getting the funds?Like grandpa said, If it ain't broke then don't fix it unless you personally are footing the Bill...SHHH. Thanx Rachel

5293 2018-12-12 15:06:13 Don’t know how the formula is arrived at in Ottawa but I assume the have not provinces get more than the haves. Not aware BC is blocking AB’s oil. I think BC is fighting to protect their environment from the dangerous bitumen AB is trying to export in massive volumes.
5294 2018-12-12 15:06:12 USE CASTER OIL , so that when it’s time for one your roots and ends will be strong we all have different hair types but if you keep it trimmed and deep condition your hair once a week if you wearing your natural hair under (wigs) etc. I get a blowout once a year while maintaining

5296 2018-12-12 15:06:05 Hmmm. Why does she look like a child from Yemen? Most unrealistic stomach and waistline I've seen since Olive Oil.
5297 2018-12-12 15:06:05 OIL: Oil rose to about $61 a barrel, supported by an industry report showing a drop in U.S. crude inventories, a cut in Libyan exports and an OPEC-led deal to trim output.
5298 2018-12-12 15:06:05 And let’s also be done with subsidy’s for the oil industry. Government shouldn’t be subsidizing the private market, but as long as they are they should do it equally.
5299 2018-12-12 15:06:04 If you’ve got it, flaunt it. As per the fortune areas who, by luck of nature, have oil and gas (minerals) reserves.
5300 2018-12-12 15:05:53 One sad fact about the oil industry is its extremely high time preference.

In the chase for oil, producers bleed off and waste (vent or flare) all of the solution gas, reducing recoverable reserves and depleting the energy drove of the pool.
5301 2018-12-12 15:05:43 Large shale finds in Australia, also not known to most people even in B.C. large offshore oil find between Vancouver island and Haida Gwaii, discovered in the early 70’s, not developed

5303 2018-12-12 15:05:37 U.S. crude oil output growth was expected to slow slightly for this year compared with previous forecasts, the Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday, but at a record 10.88 million barrels per day, the nation will end 2018 as the world's top producer.
5304 2018-12-12 15:05:35 Interesting timing how he sets one up during trade wars which also surrounds oil > 
5305 2018-12-12 15:05:33 Corn  is all modified GMO.  Plus if you microwave the pouches the oil is hydrogenated and very unhealthy.  Please start fact checking before you post.  You are driving me crazy!

5307 2018-12-12 15:05:28 You really can't go wrong with any of them. Just pick one out that best matches your skin. Oil free probably isn't it if your face is dry.
5308 2018-12-12 15:05:18 The oil/gas industry has zero unemployment. Having the government pay $8M of a $22M windmill that gives $10M in electricity is not “growth”
5309 2018-12-12 15:05:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5310 2018-12-12 15:05:09 Iraq has increased production at its southern Halfaya oilfield by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a total of 370,000 bpd, an oil official told Reuters on Wednesday. Halfaya, operated by PetroChina, is Maysan province's largest field.

5314 2018-12-12 15:04:52 The sooner-than-expected startup of the extended Sunrise oil pipeline system in west Texas has shifted flows of crude and boosted inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, close to a one-year high, with traders now bracing for builds into next year.
5315 2018-12-12 15:04:45 drilling anywhere is an ecological disaster, and this isn't just a ban on deep-water drilling that has more risks.

and since this does nothing to actually reduce the US's consumption of oil, it just shifts those damages to the arctic or the tar sands or some other place
5316 2018-12-12 15:04:44 @PremierScottMoe Should we start boycotting Quebec products as being suggested by Alberta as our oil is not socially acceptable in Quebec?

5385 2018-12-12 14:59:58 Oil is falling yet, but it will end soon and probably we won't have a substitute for petrochemicals so soon. The producers are reducing the research on oilfields but the demand will rise yet because of India.

5418 2018-12-12 14:56:53 There will be. I'm betting 45 was helping on the QT though, DU-30 said in public he speaks to 45 regularly. The strings will be manageable. Best guess, is they came to an agreement on tapping Oil and Gas in Philippine waters, China funds major infrastructure and builds factories.

5426 2018-12-12 14:55:55 This oil thing is unbelievable!!! Oil for 20£ just because one man prayed for it ??? May God help us to grow in wisdom vraiment

No!wwwww
5428 2018-12-12 14:55:52 Say it with me. Oil  doesn’t  cause  hurricanes  . Carbon taxes  won’t  prevent  arson  .
5429 2018-12-12 14:55:48 Being responsible and getting my oil changed
5430 2018-12-12 14:55:28 Welcome to the effects of fracking for oil.  It destabilizes the limestone and shale and as it shifts to fill in the gaps where the oil rich rock was taken, BAM! earthquake. Here ends the Geology lesson. Go in peace.

5438 2018-12-12 14:54:10 They used anointing oil to anoint leaders, but now we are anointed by the holy spirit
5439 2018-12-12 14:54:09 Girl this is ridiculous and you are absolutely RIGHT. My dog has horrible skin issues and I’ve wasted my time and money going to the vet multiple times just to be told it’s allergies, WHICH I ALREADY KNEW. I didn’t know about the salmon oil thing though!
5440 2018-12-12 14:53:59 Speaking at the CAX this afternoon, @iamdbanj said just like crude oil, content needs to be refined. Addressing members of the finance community in particular, he said respect the creative industry as you respect the oil industry. #IATF2018
5441 2018-12-12 14:53:59 we 'gave' #Iran nothing -- just access to their own oil revenues -- and in return got their commitments to curb their nuclear program until 2030 and beyond. pretty good deal don't you think? @realDonaldTrump
5442 2018-12-12 14:53:59 A celebrity vicar is found covered with truffle oil and mauled to death by a boar. Suspicion falls on Little Malton’s the global conglomerate in charge of the Internet, angry that a proposed change to the local custard recipe might threaten the closure of the Auburn Echo Village.
5443 2018-12-12 14:53:53 Little known fact, the 'oo' in 'boobs' actually stands for 'Olive Oil'

5445 2018-12-12 14:53:42 And those figures were before oil. They suppressed McCrone Report and lied before #Indyref. The GERS figures are a fiction so why should we believe you?

5448 2018-12-12 14:53:14 The real solution would be a serious plan to move oil from coast to coast and create jobs in each province with real savings for consumers. Problem with energy east, the plan was so sketchy, it was pulled out at the first bump on the road without even knowing the ins and outs.

5455 2018-12-12 14:52:36 Actually it doesn't say he will support oil and gas.  Having had a son working offshore it may seem as if that's what it says, but perhaps, (we may hope) the support would be for a radical recasting into offshore renewables.
5456 2018-12-12 14:52:32 @realDonaldTrump WE DON'T NEED SAUDI ARABIA THE LARGEST OIL FIELD IN THE WORLD IS IN MIDLAND TEXAS!!! KEEP TEXAS SAFE PRESIDENT TRUMP!!! GOD IS BLESSING YOU AND PROTECTION YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID FOR ISRAEL (GENESIS 12:3)

5460 2018-12-12 14:52:10 He did not make the US an oil exporter. Trade wars and tariffs are not what free trade conservatives do. A $12 billion dollar reimbursement to farmers for tariffs is the opposite of conservative, it’s socialism defined.
5461 2018-12-12 14:52:06 The little to no dependence on the FGN is commendable. He led the effort of putting together the framework and infrastructure to generate the IGR Lagos is using to finance its opex and capex. LASG fortunes are uncorrelated to oil prices.
5462 2018-12-12 14:52:04 Ontario should take Albertan oil and refine it
5463 2018-12-12 14:51:53 Some people are getting richer in the expense of other’s suffering. Peel away all the layers of causes and you will find its fuelled by money and oil. That's why its tolerated by everyone involved.

5468 2018-12-12 14:51:17 I think you hit the nail right on the head. Schumer and Pelosi are nothing more than a snake oil sales people. I think they were really embarrassed about the back-and-forth they had with Trump yesterday. They didn't want people to know what they really are, abominable people

5472 2018-12-12 14:50:39 It’s simple you snake oil salesmen, have Mexico pay for it. That’s all you said during the campaign. Build the wall and Mexico will pay for it! So shut up and make it happen jack ass.

5477 2018-12-12 14:50:23 You have to remember that Trump doesn't believe in paying people what they are due. That along with taking over a country's oil as "spoils of war". Trump is a opportunist who tries to take advantage of others whenever he can. Even as "president" he has pretty much FAILED at that.

5481 2018-12-12 14:49:56 having worked in around aberdeen during the peak oil times, it was always a q why this bypass was never built, but labour councils must have enjoyed seeing all those trucks pass their windows, it was a nightmare in town and surroundings.
5482 2018-12-12 14:49:55 Makes you wonder if the NEW push for socialism/Communism is because women will enjoy better sex. I mean, we're in age of third-wave feminism an' all. I wouldn't put it past them.

5490 2018-12-12 14:49:18 Tea tree oil 2-3 times until it starts to heal and then from there on put coconut oil on it a few times a day!! Putting TT oil on right before you go to bed helps a TON- youll see results when you wake up!

5496 2018-12-12 14:48:46 Real GDP was adversely affected in 2Q & 3Q 2018. Exports bore the brunt due to a supply shock after disruption of gas production in Sabah & Sarawak plus moderation in other commodities such as palm oil & rubber.

5505 2018-12-12 14:48:05 It is the most simplistic aspects of your life that come to your rescue no matter what issues you are grappling with. Comfort comes only from these: Like food, a cup of tea, someone to oil ur hair, fresh sheets on ur bed, & sleep! There's little that sleep can't bring respite to!
5506 2018-12-12 14:47:57 Well. So far EVERYTHING he has done fits the CONSERVATIVE AGENDA- STARTING WITH LIST OF CONSTITIIONLISTS FOR SCOTUS DURING CAMPAIGN & ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THROUGH!

5511 2018-12-12 14:47:36 But diversifications doesn't mean we will reduce the exportation of crude oil nau.....can we have the percentage contribution of the non oil sectors in different quarters for comparison to see percentage increase or decrease in it contribution?

5529 2018-12-12 14:45:59 $80 for a damn oil change after the discount  I’m stressed.
5530 2018-12-12 14:45:59 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
5531 2018-12-12 14:45:56 I know, eh... and then they try make us “phase it out” like it’s via option. Sorry, nuclear fusion hasn’t been perfected for everything yet  Might as well throw out your electrics if you say we don’t need oil anymore...
5532 2018-12-12 14:45:52 Craving… Mediterranean Salad, with grilled shrimp! Mixed greens tossed in an olive oil, lemon vinaigrette with sliced feta cheese, tomatoes, red onion, Kalamata olives, beets, and pita chips

5534 2018-12-12 14:45:46 Exactly! people forget the best wage growth we saw was during the recession when oil prices where crashes on YoY basis

5537 2018-12-12 14:45:42 Thanks for proving my point but Not a lie - Obama did many things to pollute the USA and pump oil ( we now have fossil fuel earthquakes in Tenn and Georgia today ) but NOW that we are pumping Records that Black Lovely Stuff - why do Our GOP leaders cower to tiny Saudee Men ?
5538 2018-12-12 14:45:36 Never, but the price of doing so does not come close to the covering the direct subsidies (roads), indirect subsidies (oil) and externalities (deaths, pollution). We don’t have the political will to change that, so we are doomed
5539 2018-12-12 14:45:29 Thanking my Father for allowing me to see another day.

5541 2018-12-12 14:45:25 Why do you hate American style democracy, and what is it that you do not get about Democrat support for, and love of, big oil? Thanks!

5547 2018-12-12 14:44:57 If it helps me build the missile silo and upgrade the factory to level 4 I be happy.  Those would have to be major discounts to 2 big oil builds at once though. We will see.

5557 2018-12-12 14:43:36 Saudi Arabia is now behaving in a completely unacceptable way and it is time oil and orders for goods is removed from the argument so all civilised countries can turn their backs on them until they start to behave in a civilised way.
5558 2018-12-12 14:43:20 But the real article hasn’t been tried yet.

Or something.
5559 2018-12-12 14:43:07 If the oil is really hot this should not happen. Fresh mushrooms? Or dried?

5562 2018-12-12 14:42:48 Most people are know using crude oil from local market thanks to the groundnut processing kit. Congratulations to @WAAPP_PPAAO
5563 2018-12-12 14:42:44 We're sorry if you were alarmed! What you're seeing is actually not peanut based. It's a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging that does resemble peanut butter. We can assure you that our regular Ritz Crackers do not contain peanut butter. Thanks!

5568 2018-12-12 14:42:22 Once refineries are built the goalposts will move from we don’t want dirty oil PLs to we don’t want/need hydrocarbon PLs of any form.

5577 2018-12-12 14:41:25 Last Week:
The actual reason behind the petrol price before election as rupee has strengthens from 74.40 to 69 against US dollar and the same time oil price fall down against US Dollar.
5578 2018-12-12 14:41:24 brown sugar, a little cocoa powder, and some olive oil. mix it together so that its super grainy (it'll be very crumbly, and it makes a mess lol). Scrub it all over your face, leave it on for like 10-15 minutes, then rinse. It stays good in a tupperware for weeks!

5585 2018-12-12 14:40:49 I’ve been up since eight to get an oil change for my dad 
5586 2018-12-12 14:40:38 Are there lessons your country can learn?

1) Find enough oil

2) Have a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund from oil revenues.

3) Educate your people.
5587 2018-12-12 14:40:35 Tim can you daiss the oil
5588 2018-12-12 14:40:35 Wouldn't have mattered. Her responses to indefensible things were hilarious. She argued lots of large donations by oil and gas execs to Beto didn't qualify as donations from the oil and gas industry. I shit you not.

5590 2018-12-12 14:40:17 Few lucky one's sold at 70 after the stock bounced back. Now at 50s. Q3 result will be less than Q2 due to oil price. Overall the trend will be -ve.  Stock is not even grabbing attention of noob investors!
5591 2018-12-12 14:40:16 ... I like bald men, if you want me to like you shave your head bald and put baby oil on it 
5592 2018-12-12 14:40:13 Thx! The Northeast seems like a huge opportunity for locally produced renewable diesel/heating oil. My winter costs can exceed $3K per year.

5602 2018-12-12 14:39:26 #USA #inflation is slowing down to 2.2% yoy, allowing time for an anticipated rate hike. The decline in oil prices has had a positive effect offsetting inflationary pressures created by a tight labour market
5603 2018-12-12 14:39:24 coconut oil clogs your pores, it’s one of the only oils the skin can not absorb
5604 2018-12-12 14:39:22 @marcorubio the US just wants to invade #Venezuela for its oil. You should be ashamed, your origins are latin american. USA's backyard? Please, grow up.
5605 2018-12-12 14:39:17 A4... (2)Also, we need to redirect our focus on the Nigeria Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (NERGP) if we're serious about combating #climatechange. One of it's main objective  is boosting oil production which is not in tandem with the #SDG2030 target. #ClimateWednesday
5606 2018-12-12 14:39:10  Merval abre arriba (+1.39%). Empresas de Oil & Gas suben 1.58% en promedio, siendo el sector más destacado. YPFD +1.34%, APBR +2.43%.
5607 2018-12-12 14:39:02 They lifted sanctions allowing people to purchase Iranian oil and invest in Iranian businesses.
5608 2018-12-12 14:38:52 Sadly there are many illiterates like him out there who think that somehow it's only Alberta that benefits from oil & gas.
5609 2018-12-12 14:38:44 They come pre oiled. No cooking oil needed.
5610 2018-12-12 14:38:40 It shouldn't when FIRS and Custom are making about N4 Trillion in revenue annually. 
Everything is on oil, no one talks about the Tax.
5611 2018-12-12 14:38:37 read up on the oil interests that wrecked the country..... all powerful countries involved from China to America. Stop following political realist theory. Not in sync with 21st century
5612 2018-12-12 14:38:37 Yeah thank god Rupert Murdoch invented the concept of having more than four of something or we'd all be fucked!

Don't worry about the "magnificent" mogul's years of manipulation of UK public to serve his own vast corporate and oil interests.

5615 2018-12-12 14:38:30 The issue of inflation is a factor that concerns foreign exchange. Until recently, we import virtually 90% of the rice we consumed and that has affected our foreign reserve due to falling oil prices. Are you aware of Venezuela and its economic woos due to falling oil prices?
5616 2018-12-12 14:38:24 Sa nakabunot sakin for christmas or jist basically any1 na willing magregalo hehe i want oil paint equipment thx v much

5710 2018-12-12 14:29:28 Norway just stopped palm oil imports. BRAVO. Every palm oil product should have a warning much like cigarettes do as to the result of killing rainforest and the habitat of the oragutans, gorillas, etc. Such a beautiful creature to be disrespected by man.
5711 2018-12-12 14:29:11 Donald, stop lying.
1. It was always  Iran's money, held in trust, not ours, and it wasn't in our hands ever.
2. The amount was closer to $60 billion, not the amount you claim.
3. It wasn't cash. A lot of it was in swaps and products for their oil.
5712 2018-12-12 14:29:09 Hahaha! She's been investigated 6 Xs in 25 yrs by the GOP. Not so much as a fine. But SHE'S the snake oil salesman? Bless your heart. I guess all those billionaires on Drumpf's cabinet and at his taxpayer-grifting private club who pay $200K to join are philanthropists?

5715 2018-12-12 14:28:55 Her whining is getting a bit tiresome. She should be blaming past Conservative governments for screwing up the revenues from oil and gas so that Alberta has no nest egg for these rough times
5716 2018-12-12 14:28:51 It also strikes me that your focus has been on your £30 pw budget and it is clear that fish, meat and things like extra virgin oil will make that unachievable.

Odd that you asked for and were given help then went in this direction.

Good luck.
5717 2018-12-12 14:28:49 The problem in the oil business is its cyclical nature & remote working locations means when the industry is ramping up there are shortages of workers then when it's in decline there are layoffs. To remedy this, companies have employed technology & automation at all levels.
5718 2018-12-12 14:28:42 Did you know that there are only about 300-400 North American Right Whales left in the world? There are so few left because for centuries Right whales have been hunted for their oil and baleen. Along with entanglements in fishing gear, these whales are becoming extinct. #mcggovt

5751 2018-12-12 14:24:46 Venezuela has a socialist government dedicated to looking after the welfare of the Venezuelan people. In previous times it was US corporations who were stealing the oil from them. This was remedied. The government of Venezuela is not acting as you say Victor, nor is Russia.
5752 2018-12-12 14:24:37 Just another reminder, @JoeNeguse TAKES MONEY FROM OIL AND GAS, he would not endorse the 2500 ft setback of fracking wells from homes, schools, hospitals!

5754 2018-12-12 14:24:27 Legault should explain why Quebec buys their oil from Saudi Arabia ... a country much much dirtier than Alberta oil.  Get some morals Quebec.
5755 2018-12-12 14:24:14 TLDR: wd-40 lubricates until it catches fire and explodes.  Engine oil typically isn't flammable.  Also, if you leave an engine floored in park, the excess fuel will cause your catalytic converter to heat up red hot.
5756 2018-12-12 14:24:11 Well with rising gas prices and the fact that oil will eventually run out, I think stockpiling magical coal is a sound business strategy if you ask me

5764 2018-12-12 14:23:28 Another crucial intervention is the need to include fossil fuel extraction itself; in its draft form it is easily politically undermined to continue to expand fracking for export overseas. That’s likely why @JoeNeguse who takes oil and gas interest money backs it.
5765 2018-12-12 14:23:26 Hey Donald that’s a LIE! The 150 billion dollars to Iran was THEIR OWN MONEY that we returned to them, money Iran earned from selling oil.

5832 2018-12-12 14:17:29 I don’t think I’ll ever understand why olive oil has so many calories
5833 2018-12-12 14:17:29 Well this makes sense now... you don’t know what you are taking about.  The line in use wasn’t mostly built it was done 60 yrs ago, twinning wasn’t shelved for wilderness it was about the harbour...dirtiest oil (the tar sands that is found at the surface) haha not even close.
5834 2018-12-12 14:17:24 . Sorry, I’m a Native Los Angeleno & life long West Coaster. 3.3 & a 4.4? What do you think will happen if you take all that crude oil & fracking is going to do to the stability of fault lines long dead?

5855 2018-12-12 14:15:55 Two questions so get yer running shoes on
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas or the 8% we get now?

2) Do you think the half of scots that want to,are wrong to want to run thier own country?

You will fudge and run like History woman did.
5856 2018-12-12 14:15:41 Me: Hi, I ordered oil on Friday, and it never came and now my tank is empty.
Them: Our online system was down. We’ll get it to you this afternoon. So, your tank is empty?
Me: Yes.
Them: Ok, for future reference,
we need a few days notice.
Me:

5861 2018-12-12 14:15:17 Yep. And their brands include everything from salt, cocoa, frying oil and tortillas.
5862 2018-12-12 14:15:16 it was a weird red stain before, so we've got it down to base and we'll oil it to see how it comes up, then beeswax  I'm really loathe to paint wood stuff like this

5895 2018-12-12 14:12:13 So I used to have this issue. The next day I put coconut oil on it and it really helps to soothe that sensation and like in the Nikon area I put a tiny bit of antibacterial (no alcochol and not straight after shaving) and it helped with any razor burns coming up.
5896 2018-12-12 14:12:12 Craig you are pushing the planet to the brink. It's really not right. If you have children you should think of them, think of the next generation. Humanity is bright and is great at innovation — we can engineer new energy models but coal and oil are simply going to kill us.

Some illegal, some being pursued by DEA to be illegal - such as Kratom, and some still allowed to be bought across State lines like CBD and Hemp Oil. People in severe pain need options.

5982 2018-12-12 14:04:41 Well, I mean gas prices are heading back up, despite the low price of a barrel of oil. We will always have the highest gas prices in Canada while we ship millions of barrels of oil to the US from the Grand Banks, just like we did with the cod out there. How did that turn out?

6087 2018-12-12 13:56:06 Let Trump fufill his campaign promises and have Mexico pay.

Trump's a failure and I feel deep sorrow for anyone who got suckered by the snake oil salesman.

6093 2018-12-12 13:55:16 We are taking about Lagos. The oil belongs to d fg, the oil states get 13%, yet Lagos is richer than those states. Those states don't v d status Lagos has, former capital of Nigeria.
6094 2018-12-12 13:55:06 Use coconut oil. It heals all cavaties.
6095 2018-12-12 13:54:54 Not crazy. People used Castor bean oil when there were petroleum shortages. That's how Castrol got their start.
6096 2018-12-12 13:54:50 Trump = snake oil salesman!
6097 2018-12-12 13:54:40 Thank you! This looks great. I'm teaching a course on oil cultures this spring; I'll def try and squeeze some of this in.
6098 2018-12-12 13:54:34 Tearing apart the environment that allows us to live. We everything has something to be sold. As an object to be owned. But what happens when we have polluted the last river? Poisoned the last breath of air? Have no oil for the trucks to bring us our food?

6106 2018-12-12 13:53:57 After seeing Colorado's tax revenues, my guess is that politicians in all states will be lining up to legalize pot.  Also, much medicinal research shows that CBD oil can replace addictive pain killers
6107 2018-12-12 13:53:54 Truth: President Obama did not just give Iran $150 bl.
Iran had sold, and delivered, large quantities of oil to several countries who then were not able to pay for the oil. the money was sequestered by those countries and through agreements the banking restrictions were lifted.

6117 2018-12-12 13:52:42 The Wall is a fake, a trick; a Mexico wall leaves 3987 miles of Canadian border open, go to Canada and slip through. Inconceivable high IQ cannot figure this, but no need since the wall is a show to fool uncritical thinkers. The Wall is Snake Oil. Deceit, lies and more lies!
6118 2018-12-12 13:52:42 "Europe is now a ‘post-peak oil’ continent. Currently, every single major oil producer in Western Europe is in decline. […] Western European oil production peaked between 1996 and 2002. Since then, production had declined while net exports have gradually increased."

6132 2018-12-12 13:51:08 What baffles me is how bad they are at this. Kamala is a cop, Kirsten fired Al Franken, & Beto is an oil man are such specious arguments that they fall apart. It's like they studied the trump strategy and are trying to replicate it.

6139 2018-12-12 13:50:48 Buhari is searching for oil in the north. He would spend tax payers money and not find it.

Moghalu calls oil the "god of small things"
He's focused on innovation and growth.

Clear choice. #Moghalugetso2019

6172 2018-12-12 13:47:14 Ultimate outcome of restructuring cannot be precisely predicted. Safe to say that states that have oil will keep more revenue. Kwara does not have oil and will get less than before. Saraki is from Kwara & quiet but we know that his heart cannot be in restructuring. Just mouth it

6182 2018-12-12 13:46:32 Exactly.  Canada doesn’t need any more refineries. The US has surplus refineries, what they want is crude oil.
Plus how would Canada compete with existing operating paid-out US refineries that have 25% lower costs of production and favorable taxes?

6212 2018-12-12 13:43:18 It wasn’t in U.S.’s hands, it was money that other countries (South Korea, India and China, etc. owed Iran for buying Iran’s oil. As a result of sanctions, this money was frozen. This was Iran’s all along. Nobody “gave” Iran 150 billion, they let Iran access its own assets abroad

6216 2018-12-12 13:43:03 Recent Permian Basin oil discovery is biggest news in NM.  Will put a lot of $ into state coffers, and the leaders of the leg are talking about “moonshots” on education and health.  Could be a perfect moment for a carbon capture project.
6217 2018-12-12 13:43:01 I didn't say completely. There are things today anyone can do to limit oil use. The worst use is burning.
Another use is having the idea that plants will die if we dont burn it.
#TeamVeggie should care more about stopping extinction than feeding plants with superfluous carbon.

6226 2018-12-12 13:42:03 of course, to trump's understanding and interest, under the sole condition that the top 1% Americans get hurt, or get threatened, they would do something good for the mass. trump doesn't represent average Americans, he is the puppet for arm dealers, oil companies and the Jews.
6227 2018-12-12 13:41:49 I can tell you what happens without going to the article it blows up. WD 40 is not oil it is a special penetrant that displaces water. It doesn't lubricate at all. The WD stands for water displacement. And the 40 is how many tries it took to make it work for the navy in WWII

6229 2018-12-12 13:41:39 On top of that Alberta had more revenue from federal transfers than from the oil and gas sector. I think those actions are pretty helpful, don't you?

6236 2018-12-12 13:40:50 Accepting essential oils for my oil diffusers for Christmas maybe if I used them more it would help with the stress and headaches
6237 2018-12-12 13:40:49 What happened to all the millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico via Deepwater Horizon?  The world ate it.  Why is it that the LEFT always defines a crisis of any kind and the solution is always the same: more taxes, more wealth transfer, more power to the Government?

And that oil comes from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, some coal too.

6261 2018-12-12 13:38:40 @avilewis was mocked on @ctvqp last Sunday for emphasizing the government's obsequious nature to their relationship with big oil. Really sad to see what happened the last 3.5 years in Alberta when the @NDP had a real chance to show, at the very least, their positions
6262 2018-12-12 13:38:36 You’re comparing someone’s performance as PM with a statement I made about the newly appointed RBI gov. It’s not an apples to apples comparison. Manmohan liberalized the economy and oversaw strongest periods of the economy as FM & PM. 2013 global oil shock was out of his control

6267 2018-12-12 13:38:01 Not at all ...Like all snake oil salesmen  the truth is they're only interested in their own selfish lust for power.
6268 2018-12-12 13:38:01 Yes, but a mid-level manager at an oil company gave $200 to Beto’s campaign, which will only accelerate the warming.
6269 2018-12-12 13:37:59 Spurs haven't come from years of domination, or years of challenging in the league.

6273 2018-12-12 13:37:25 Stupid that money belonged to Iran. It means Iran sold its oil and US released their money. National security is domestic issue. Taxpayers money and senators don’t want to support your idiotic dreams.

6275 2018-12-12 13:37:23 (59% of total). In sunflower oil plant breeding and manufacturing, four types of processed oil containing different amounts of the major fatty acids are produced.[2] The expressed oil  has light amber color with a mild flavor. The oil contains a rich content of vitamin E.

Can be found at Walmart/Target/drugstore for under $10 as well.

Such an ignorant oil spiller.

6363 2018-12-12 13:27:11 Sorry but that is rubbish. That is declaring a referendum is open season to any old Snake Oil salesman as no accountability is to be held by them. A Brexiteer should have stood by their vision and lead. As they did not it is clear it was all BS!
6364 2018-12-12 13:27:07 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

6384 2018-12-12 13:25:47 /shale gas, it's a technique used in conventional oil and gas too. Oil companies have been doing it here in the UK for the last 40 years, and the entire North Sea was fracked. No one made a fuss then about microquakes. Why all the concern now?

6390 2018-12-12 13:24:52 Then we shouldn't judge blindly, without proof, its better to keep quiet than give an error judgment.
6391 2018-12-12 13:24:49 Haha, yea sure. Obviously your lost. Without oil, Saudi Arabia is a desert.

6398 2018-12-12 13:24:20 With me it's incense such as frankencense or myrr, cypress oil, chocolate, beer (the darker the better), and obsidian.

6402 2018-12-12 13:24:12 The overdependence on oil WAS the Venezuelan problem, they failed to diversify their economy so when oil prices fell globally their economy tanked. 

The UK has a far more diverse economy and we have had for more left-wing PMs than Corbyn through the last century.
6403 2018-12-12 13:24:09 RT ninan99: LoriShemek 100% agree with you

1) Avocado oil for cooking
2) Extra Virgin olive oil for raw food including salads
3) Coconut oil for cooking RT
6404 2018-12-12 13:24:09 Kathy, My thought exactly. Also the other way around, an oil man at State is a Woop-woop klaxon to Russia that Trump is on their side for high priced oil, Putin's greatest wish (which gets very little press, oddly.)
6405 2018-12-12 13:24:07 I feel the same now we have a president that puts our countries best interest 1st. Now that we have endless jobs, #1 in oil I would really like to see us get the boarder built ASAP. After that America can then help countries Honduras,DRC,Syria,Exc with stability once we are safe!
6406 2018-12-12 13:24:06 Even if we were to stipulate that Sirota was obligated to explain to everyone what Open Secrets data does and does not prove, (all of which is on the site), a blgger’s failure to do so is trivial compared to a candidate for the presidency taking oil exec $ after pledging not to.
6407 2018-12-12 13:24:05 I'm so sick of this peppermint oil she keeps burning . Its giving me Sunday afternoon church vibes
6408 2018-12-12 13:24:02 It wasn’t cash or gold or dollars. It was not very liquid. A lot of it was in form of swaps, and products that Iran had agreed to receive in return for their oil.
6409 2018-12-12 13:23:56 OIL
Saudi Arabia is consolidating relations with Russia, which will probably be more uniform in the #OPEC cartel. OPEC is no longer as united after Qatar left.

6410 2018-12-12 13:23:49 As @TankerTrackers data is cited more often, they should provide a margin of error as they are not official number.

6411 2018-12-12 13:23:48 It wasn’t in U.S.’s hands, this was the money that other countries (mostly South Korea, India and China) owed Iran for purchasing Iran’s oil. As a result of sanctions, this money was frozen there.

6417 2018-12-12 13:23:24 Bush and Cheney started this war for oil for which we had alternatives. It was Bush's (and Cheney’s)responsibility to stop it, but as Bush said when he left office—he was pushing it off to the next president.
6418 2018-12-12 13:23:16 Think of it as a spider web where the cabal controls:  money (central banks), media, big pharma, oil, education... Literally everything.
6419 2018-12-12 13:23:11 #OPEC keeps 2019 forecasts for global oil supply and demand mostly unchanged in monthly report; says production outside OPEC is poised to expand more than demand; trimmed estimates for amount of OPEC oil world will need by 90K b/d #OOTT
6420 2018-12-12 13:22:59 Economy is clearly decelerating.Powell & Clarida were slow to see it but I think they are finally waking up to the reality. A pause is likely but 10yr & 30yr Treasuries beginning strong rallies due to inflation rollover(oil) & slowing economy so rates will be down with or w/o Fed
6421 2018-12-12 13:22:54 I guess China's insistence on Continuing to export oil from Iran or their participation in BRICS has nothing to do with U.S. decision to try to demonize them

6506 2018-12-12 13:15:13 Oh really. She told me she left the company a year+ ago when the oil oversupplied and the price dropped a lot. But it's getting better now.

6508 2018-12-12 13:15:03 I admire the commitment to theme of Hanukkah. It's a festival commemorating magical oil so uhhhhh we celebrate by eating deep fried foods like potatoes and donuts
6509 2018-12-12 13:15:02 “A story isn't a charcoal sketch, where every stroke lies on the surface to be seen. It's an oil painting, filled with layers that the author must uncover so carefully to show its beauty.” 
― Amelia Atwater-Rhodes
6510 2018-12-12 13:15:01 Exactly Mick. I'm also pissed that we fund Saudi Arabia oil ( 9/11 terrorists from SA), Iraq oil, (still tons of terrorists), and Canada (too polite).
6511 2018-12-12 13:14:45 "The ones Unionist said weren't there and hat Oil was running out"

Have you seen the revenues from the Nort Sea over the last 10 years?
I hope you're not getting yourself too excited.

BTW if oil company executives hid drilling results they would be locked up. 
They don't.

6519 2018-12-12 13:14:13 Is there any fracking for oil going on in Tennessee—if so I wonder if that would explain the 4.4 earthquake—the first of that magnitude in 45 years
6520 2018-12-12 13:14:12 For me incense such as frankencense or myrr, cypress oil, chocolate, beer (the darker the better), and obsidian.

Hathor likes floral perfumes like rose, mirrors, wine, emerald, turquoise, and the myrtle flower.

6522 2018-12-12 13:13:55 To each their own.  To me, Laphroaig tastes like a rag soaked in oil, glazed with a fresh coat of WD-40, and then garnished with asphalt.  Other people must like it.

For one year supply chain would have to fire people. Okay.

Personally: I do not believe it. We shall see.
6534 2018-12-12 13:12:30 No, we want the oil, we just dont want your stone age pipeline destroying our environment.

Is it the fact our leader is a man-boy who can't compose a coherent thought?

The incompetence of our cabinet ministers?

The post-national "Canada is not a thing"?

Opening our borders to anyone?

Destroying our oil and gas industry?
6561 2018-12-12 13:10:21 The Saudis were never a U.S ally anymore than the Turks--both leased bases and made money off the Cold War and arms race, by using the Oil Bookshelf as a tool to mask immoral not so Holy Islamic teachings--hypocrisy as deep as Christian Popes in code decrying Revenge.

6580 2018-12-12 13:08:14 I'm from and live in Quebec and I'm a bit ashamed of this whole situation. People seem to think that if the oil from the west does not come by pipeline, it won't be burned. I want to reduce co2 emissions as much as anyone but let's be realistic. It will just come from elsewhere.

6604 2018-12-12 13:05:19 Since Nigeria depends heavily on crude oil as the main source of income or foreign exchange earning, her revenue suffers when there is a global shock. The effect of globalization is the fear of uncertainty and volatility on capital formation and productivity growth.

6656 2018-12-12 13:00:04 Add these things:  Fewer people on welfare and food stamps, and for the first time in 70 years, we are now an exporting oil nation.  How can you complain?  Americans are better off now than in decades.

6660 2018-12-12 12:59:47 The Wall doesn’t have 5 billion in oil revenue sitting in a bank account.

6662 2018-12-12 12:59:44 That is fine by me. It survived and will be making mega-profits again next year, regardless of oil price. I don't know if GE will survive, but if I were their Chairman, I would slash the div to zero and get a new CEO.

6672 2018-12-12 12:58:43 Ironically, ISIS has probably done more to #keepitintheground than any other group, since they are making it very difficult to pump oil from the large Kirkuk conventional reserve. Maybe that's why 70 countries are bombing them.

6684 2018-12-12 12:57:25 I am afraid that you have no idea what you are talking about. So before starting trying to show what a smart ass you are better get a look on how olive oil is produced. Untill then have a nice day.

I don’t mind it because like you I can sort out the gems from the sales pitch but I can see how it can come across. My motto - be wary of the snake oil salesmen - their shoes shine brighter than the rest.
6707 2018-12-12 12:54:20 They must have got oil no? or some lucrative contracts.

6709 2018-12-12 12:54:11 Snake oil isn't what I put my faith in. He has done some good. However this "he has a plan" crud is simply Trump train riders grasping for anything to hold on to because he hasn't done anything major that he promised. Now it's too little too late.

6711 2018-12-12 12:53:56 Yes be worried. They are not safer than cigarettes. There are chemicals in the oil that can cause long term affects. Do some research so to have a solid argument. Cutting off allowance is only going to push teen to find another source.
6712 2018-12-12 12:53:55 They’re are not buying the oil. The market reacted because of the announcement and BP Whiting is finished work over.

6783 2018-12-12 12:47:18 Dilute it luv. Tea tree it VERY strong. Get the raw one from the pharmacy. 
I mix mine with coconut oil and I put some peppermint oil in it also. 

You’re putting a couple drops in whatever because of how strong it is

6792 2018-12-12 12:46:26 You tell us US is shipping oil. If  true why are we buying? Why do we not use what we have produced in America for Americans? OPEC is an organization that is designed to support the globalization efforts and sustainability of big oil/global elite. why bother with them.

6797 2018-12-12 12:45:46 The irony is that the soap used here probably contains 30% palm oil - which is the very cause of the devastation of the orangutans’ homes.
6798 2018-12-12 12:45:44 No we don’t, the oil sands aren’t large enough or easy enough to get oil from to supply all of Canada, this we rely on the US and others who pump straight crude oil.

6804 2018-12-12 12:45:12 Tiger nuts are a popular snack in West Africa. The oil made from tiger nuts is high in unsaturated fatty acids and was first used by the Egyptians 4000 years ago in preference to olive oil. Tiger nut milk, is called Kunnu Aya in parts of Nigeria and Horchata de Chufa in Spain.

6808 2018-12-12 12:45:02 Saudi Arabia has production cost bellow 10 USD per barrel, why they don’t simply boost production to infinity?
They can sell oil even at 15 USD and still be very profitable. In the meanwhile production boost will sky rocket their economy.

6850 2018-12-12 12:41:03 CANADA OIL OUTPUT CUT

I'm told when in Norway oil producers "cut" output, they actually do not, as they'd have to fire people themselves and the supply chains.

So, the Government of Norway simply buys the oil and temporarily stores it.

I suspect Canada is doing the same.

6925 2018-12-12 12:32:41 It's all well and good to be righteous and indignant, but c'mon let's be adults here. If you really value the sanctity of the environment, there's a lot of other things you need to do that aren't quite so cathartic as channeling anger toward an oil company.
6926 2018-12-12 12:32:32 Why does it matter?  When your brother in arms is finished with the oil industry they won't be emitting any fumes.  Unlike the flatulence that is emitted by  you and Justine @JustinTrudeau whenever you open your mouths.  Let a real leader take the helm @MaximeBernier '

6979 2018-12-12 12:26:38 I don't disagree with that ..but while some recent conditional polling temporarily hides the trend, there is a declining support for inde  -mainly because alongside *Oil* - the other key assertion in 2014 was Inde would be *easy*; and Brexit is showing that isn't a tenable view.
6980 2018-12-12 12:26:36 No. Unless of course you would rather believe oil PR people than the global scientific community. But if that’s your deal, we have nothing to discuss. It’s hard to have a conversation with someone starting from a position of not believing verifiable truths.

6984 2018-12-12 12:26:23 Your understanding of the Bible needs work, Mendacity.  God gave Man dominion over the Earth.  He gave us abundant resources of energy with which to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish and subdue the Earth.  Oil and gas are for our use. Our sin is not forgiven by taxing them.

7021 2018-12-12 12:21:39 But who controls our resources? We are incapable of deciding who we can sell our oil. Who is the largest beneficiary of our resource? Who makes more profit from our resource? Canadian or American? Our government is just a comprador for the US.
7022 2018-12-12 12:21:29 @ImranKhanPTI please look into it. We dont need furnace oil power plant we need a shared energy economy. Which will reduce the cost of import of oil for power sector, decrease CO2 emission and also help businesses. Can explain more if you are interested #important

7074 2018-12-12 12:13:49 Unpopular Opinion:

When you say that a plant such as palm oil isn't vegan because of the ethics involved in it's production you open the door to critics that say Avocados aren't vegan, or Broccoli isn't Vegan because of production methods. Then there's animal fertilisers etc..

7086 2018-12-12 12:12:03 Australia ranks atrociously in climate change action: Australia’s position on climate change has been described as “unconscionable for a wealthy country”, “irresponsible to the extreme” by leading scientists, and supportive of the oil allies’ rejection of global warming science.
7087 2018-12-12 12:12:02 Adrian, yes agreed - still risks until it actually flows. Fingers crossed though because the Weald proof of concept needs more than one successful site.

Anyway, if there are issues I'm sure they can call on Arrogant2017 to come in and fix them. Senior oil exec my arse!
7088 2018-12-12 12:11:42 I doubt they have the flow rate detail as yet, they just know that there is enough oil for it to be commercial.

7206 2018-12-12 11:56:43 Apparently Russia is not interested in the peace talks that was initiated by France to put an end to d incessant conflicts going on DR Congo.Obviously 'cos DRC doesn't have the resources that can be of comparative advantage to them eg. Oil

7212 2018-12-12 11:55:47 That's because all the Global Warming models are inaccurate, i.e., they aren't accounting for the RAPID INCREASE in temperature CAUSED by METHANE being released from Fracking in the U.S. under Trump.

It's a suicide pact with Big Oil and the GOP.
7213 2018-12-12 11:55:35 I'm sure oil/gas pipelines use the same tactics

7264 2018-12-12 11:46:49 Lol. Outside of the score go look at the numbers. The Oilers got outplayed badly. Varlamov letting in horrible goals in 2nd he normally saves is why they won. Avs could have 8+ goals tonight if it wasn't for Koskinen...dude is why they're winning games. When he cools, Oil cools.

7341 2018-12-12 11:35:30 I feel your pain. I couldn't use anything other than a Chromebook. However for some very specific activities in your case, you still have to use those old fashioned machines powered by oil 
7342 2018-12-12 11:35:23 Oil is an essential part of a diet.  Oils are in plants.  But I’m going to veer off further into a new subtopic.
7343 2018-12-12 11:35:16 There are good arguments that we need both. Supply side constraints to prevent leakage (just selling all the oil to someone else). Demand side policy to protect against undesirable outcomes (wind turbine factories shutting down, people freezing to death, etc).

7345 2018-12-12 11:34:59 I dropped the car off for an oil change, I just know the mechanic is going to find a thousand dollars of something else because he's a mechanic and I don't know a fucking thing about engines.

7348 2018-12-12 11:34:37 Finished Bertolucci's all-but-forgotten oil doc 'La Via del Petrolio' this morning. As rigid and didactic as the first two parts are, Bertolucci's absurd, fur-hatted journalist almost saves the entire enterprise with his appearance in part 3.
7349 2018-12-12 11:34:30 @RachelNotley Good idea to buld an oil refinery: but make sure that oil refinery is able to treat heavy oil like you have in oil sands
7350 2018-12-12 11:34:29 Agreed people getting carried away. I think it will flow. I hope at initial 1000bpd. But that won't make Angus worth £250m+ and PV knows it.
Maybe £65m value to Angus - 16p/share. - based on 6 wells ultimately recovering 1m barrels each. Could be a bit better if shales flow well.

7474 2018-12-12 11:17:54 Not really. Veganism accepts that to survive we must do some harm to eat crops. Oils are not required for survival, on the contrary, they are bad for health. So if you are going to say no to the oil with the least amount of deforestation you logically should be oil free.

7901 2018-12-12 10:14:59 You & success don't mix it's like water & oil but atleast you have a big mouth so that makes up for everything.
7902 2018-12-12 10:14:29 So the dilemma is: continue palm oil use, even thought sustainable palm oil is not true and the orangutans go extinct or switch to animal oils, which is not going to stop anytime soon, and the orangutan habitat is spared? It’s not a hard choice.
7903 2018-12-12 10:14:28 And some reputable qiyas that's based on Qur'an and sunnah.

7908 2018-12-12 10:13:36 Come to believe this is the strategy of Trump admin. Let the South take the reins. North more likely to have more trust in their own kind so to speak than outsiders. Just hope South is clear eyed here and not naive.

“We came, we saw, he died”?

Gaddafi was killed by Americans through a sponsored revolt. For selling his oil in Euros and not USDs. His arsenal was then transferred to #ISIS. 

Don’t blame development.

7947 2018-12-12 10:08:25 I put the oil in the pan and let it heat up for a while. Immediately the eggs go in, I start stirring it and turn off the gas. Then I stir it gently and turn it around till I get it the way I want. (Very soft and not over-cooked). The key is the heat, for me.

7964 2018-12-12 10:06:10 That we don't talk in some cases is because we choose what to comment on to avoid unnecessary drama, but once you quote the religion out of context then you'll see the reflection of our Islamiyya training on us.

8184 2018-12-12 09:31:57 The people installing the IT system botched it.

8199 2018-12-12 09:30:27 Following our rather delightful 'fatberg' tweet, there are companies out there that covert cooking oil into a bio-liquid which can be used to generate electricity and heat. We would be intrigued to know if any facilities use these and how easy are they to use?

8283 2018-12-12 09:18:44 Absolutely fossil fuels and oil, as well as rice paddy fields, all have a role in methane. 

Industrialised animal ag, with its huge reliance on feed crops, is a great user of fossil fuels for production.
8284 2018-12-12 09:18:32 Where did I say the “EU is a good citizen” on climate change? I repeatedly note the EU’s locking hi-CO2 gas as a major part of its energy strategy, its CO2 targets align with 3-4°C, car standards weakened by Germany, UK expanding oil & gas, & there’s widespread airport expansion.

8312 2018-12-12 09:15:12 I doubt it. 'Green' #energy projects would still be highly questionable in legal terms. #WesternSahara remains occupied by Morocco. To exploit #Saharawi natural resources without Saharawi consent is a war crime. That goes for renewable energy companies as well as oil companies.
8313 2018-12-12 09:15:10 What a moronic statement. Can you survive without oil and gas? By the way carbon emission blah blah blah is a hogwash. It is a myth that c emission is changing climate. The earth is getting hotter since ice age millions of years back. So chill.

8340 2018-12-12 09:10:31 They also don’t need to put oil in all those products. Palm oil is put in milks, for example, as a source of Vitamin A. 

Not needed. The dairy industry just thought it was a good marketing thang.

8349 2018-12-12 09:09:44 Would love to see the headline: "MILLENIALS ARE KILLING THE OIL INDUSTRY"
8350 2018-12-12 09:09:37 "Sustainable" palm oil is a bit of a red herring. Sustainable palm oil has still deforested twice as much land as is currently required for production.
8351 2018-12-12 09:09:20 I think the Oil should aim to go no worse than 5-3-0 in their final 8 games this month, which would keep them well above the pace they need to maintain.

8372 2018-12-12 09:05:58 Nigeria. It is Africa’s largest oil producer of oil and the 13th largest in the world. However, Nigeria is facing a major problem. Oil is being stolen at an industrial scale of 100,000 barrels every day costing the country over $8 billion in lost revenue a year. - The Economist
8373 2018-12-12 09:05:52 Isn’t it a bit stupid that for food the emissions are deemed to occur where it is produced but for oil it’s where it is consumed?
8374 2018-12-12 09:04:57 Before 2015 Nigeria’s Oil was being stolen on an industrial scale!

8425 2018-12-12 08:52:19 We wouldn’t have a ‘palm oil problem’ if we didn’t put the huge amount that we do into the feed of livestock, palm oil isn’t the problem, yet again meat eaters are  like you just said, it gives the biggest yield from the least space, any other oil is even more unsustainable

3. We have to drive benefit to those who provide the data - options for this

Then Pull skin to stretch out the section I'm shaving. That thin wrinkly skin is treacherous if you aren't careful. Everywhere else  I use electric clippers
8583 2018-12-12 08:25:05 Matthew 25:2-3

[2]And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

[3]They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

Are we stocked up on the necessary #survival gear needed to endure? 

A wise person would follow the laws, statutes, and commandments

8585 2018-12-12 08:25:00 Trump arguing that the developing world would be heavily reliant on coal, oil and gas for some time and that it was in the world's interest to find more efficient ways of developing and burning those fuels.Noisy protesters, who chanted,"Shame on you!"and "Keep it in the ground!"

8589 2018-12-12 08:24:35 If we’d voted yes in 2014 we would’ve been bankrupt by now as the oil prices plummeted. However, I’d be happy to vote YES this time round.
8590 2018-12-12 08:24:33 A message to Venezuela... Your crisis has been provoked by the alliance between Israel USA and Saudi Arabia. They deliberately crushed the oil price in 2014, supervised by the CIA and ISIS/mossad. And now they are rising the price of the barrel again to finish off you and Iran.
8591 2018-12-12 08:24:21 *oil to flow from volta... Hmhm, they are planning to fetch and share the money without developing the place. Making the people suffer from their greed. They think Volta is Western region? Come and fetch... Wicked people... @VoltaRegion
8592 2018-12-12 08:24:16 This seems odd, "It can be said that moneyness implied volatility can be an accurate indication of the real volatility for natural gas since the seasonal change plays an important role in natural gas demand shift. This characteristic makes it less uncertain than the crude oil."
8593 2018-12-12 08:24:12 Trump Admin/GOP hate:

-Clean Air/Water
-Good Economy

They love:

-wildfires/floods/superstorms
-Oil/Gas/Coal like black coal in their hearts

I hope they all rot in toxic waste

I believe that oil’s on its way out and new sources of energy will be innovated. Necessity mothers invention

8615 2018-12-12 08:20:54 No. What's a suicide pact economically and a fail for the environment and human rights is letting OPEC nations meet growing demand for oil. Canadian energy and gas is a win for the global environment and human rights.

8618 2018-12-12 08:20:12 I think it’s an incredibly true dynamic of the energy return on capital investment applied to oil sources & wells.
8619 2018-12-12 08:20:04 Is the division line "Oil" or "Our Oil" here? For sure its not "Human rights". Because in this case You missed Iran. It violates every human right imaginable.
8620 2018-12-12 08:19:59 Hopefully I'll never get into an accident, but the car program that will give me the wheels I need, includes insurance to cover me.

8628 2018-12-12 08:18:27 I'm pretty sure there'll be no oil company with the word "oil" in their name soon. Right of the bat I could only think of Lukoil, since Statoil was greenwashed to Equinor.

8634 2018-12-12 08:17:48 Investors are divesting from oil across the world. The oil countries are going to become poor.

8669 2018-12-12 08:12:02 Dont want to use your language, cant fall to your levels. Its evident 4m Pic. To offset hi crude oil prices, UPA govt. burdened the country with subsidies hence petroleum prices were'nt market driven. NDA govt. was able to maintain same prices widout burdening the exchequer.

8671 2018-12-12 08:11:47 Nobody I know suggests “all oil” be eliminated from everything tomorrow. The point is arresting expansion and reducing consumption.
8672 2018-12-12 08:11:33 When did he do that ? When he was a Senator? Presidents dont change or pass laws. They sign or veto. Obama still slashed leases on public lands and block pipelines to hinder oil production in the US

8709 2018-12-12 08:05:39 100% agree Matteo. Engine noise in stations getting worse. Those suburban railcars r in desperate need of a refurbishment.

8725 2018-12-12 08:02:51 This is due to USA discovering shale gas reserves and cutting down import from Venezuela resulting in reduced oil prices. Not an achievement of Indian Govt.

8761 2018-12-12 07:56:49 It was from a dealer.  One service was a recall, one service was an alignment & the others were part of a package that I purchase (oil changes, detail, etc).  I think I've only had to cancel twice in the 2ish years that I've owned it.
8762 2018-12-12 07:56:45 NOW: Ed Morse @Citi didn't say what a possible April #OPEC cut could look like - but he said the struggle of "the bear, the camel and the eagle" is key to watch next year. "Saudi Arabia discovered that #OPEC doesn't have the clout that it used to have." @CNBCi #OOTT #Oil

8765 2018-12-12 07:56:12 NOW: Ed Morse @Citi tells me #OPEC production cut goes far enough for the time being, but he's glad they're meeting again in April. "It may be by April they have to confront another cut." @CNBCi #OOTT #Oil

8769 2018-12-12 07:55:07 That’s true but that area is so worthless and inhospitable (being a tundra & sort) that it never become a independent entities in the first place (again most Russians oil is not located in the Far East).
8770 2018-12-12 07:55:05 US didn’t sanction Bahrain with its human rights violations because it needs oil to go up the strait of Hormuz nor said anything about Saudi Arabia killing children in Yemen. In fact  the US sells bombs to Saudis that commit human rights violations in Yemen. Why the hypocrisy?

Butter makes them creamier.

8780 2018-12-12 07:53:24 BTW, Shankar Sharma has again flipped his views, After his clear lines "This was the easiest bear market to pick", he seems to suggesting something else now; Another Crude Oil moment for him!

8782 2018-12-12 07:53:03 I would suggest leaning towards cbd oil instead, and this is a whole hearted recommendation
8783 2018-12-12 07:52:51 You are actually in Rumukwurushi market, just follow that straight road and cross the bridge, you will burst out at oil mill market if that's where you are going, but if it is twitter ask for direction from the fuel station attendants at the station by that junction.

8786 2018-12-12 07:52:26 Our minerals should be held back as the oil countries does. SA Citizens should also pay less for minerals like a diamond for a diamond ring. Our minerals should be used locally to manufacture products. We should export more and import less.

8859 2018-12-12 07:41:36 Not to mention that he pulled the USA out of the Paris Climate Conference, opening up ANWR to oil drilling, and he's attempting to destroy the environment. Also, he doesn't see climate change as a grave threat.
8860 2018-12-12 07:41:31 Baby stripper or not, you would think a person would have the common sense to not wear baby oil at work! When there are legit oil spots the stage floor, and the pole is so grimy other people can feel it on my hands after just grabbing the pole then we have a fucking problem

8863 2018-12-12 07:40:32 Almost as criminal as the oil companies who destroy our planet, fund global warming denier candidates AND by the way, sell oil to make pesticides.
8864 2018-12-12 07:40:29 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
8865 2018-12-12 07:40:27 Also a huge amount of accumulated oil money, which they didn't waste as we did.

8868 2018-12-12 07:40:18 That's a damn lie! Non oil sector growth was much better before this administration and it was non oil sector contraction that led to the recession. You're talking garbage

8871 2018-12-12 07:40:00 Moreover the politics balance will have an impact as the US SPR are being released without any sort of pending oil crisis in the country. This is distorting the prices even more.
Shale revolution is just an invention addressed many times by @Khalid_AlFalih in the last 2 years
8872 2018-12-12 07:39:57 yes because, through the petro $, the usa control the oil markets. Petroyuan is a counter power and a influence tool .  I’m interesting to know witch countries pay in petroyuan. If you know...
8873 2018-12-12 07:39:50 Tories & Labour Blairites squandered oil wealth to fund wars.
8874 2018-12-12 07:39:45 matt they are all neo cons, that love the israel advancement plan and the love iranian oil. what about he amaerican worker?
8875 2018-12-12 07:39:13 Theres water and coconut oil . It sure did
8876 2018-12-12 07:39:08 It's crazy that people can't decipher between growth caused by increase in global oil price and the one caused by diversification. The 7% growth was caused by the oil sector while the recent 1.8% is caused only by the non-oil sector which rarely happens in this part of the world

8881 2018-12-12 07:38:21 Or if we want to go the other way, and look at imports coming in from Mexico, well who buys the imports? We do. It’s just a raising of the cost, aka us paying for it. However you slice it, Mexico is not funding the wall.
8882 2018-12-12 07:38:14 Chris Watts was aMalignant Narcissist with no boundaries like McCann he killed his wife and kids and stuffed the kids into oil vats..with no remorse..they arenr real people..fortunately hes now in jail doing 5 life sentences..the duo remain free. this is wrong and corrupt!
8883 2018-12-12 07:38:12 Well Russians oil is located in the western Siberia & Urals mountain which is closer to the Europeans population center than Chinese populations center (and remember Rasputitsa is real) so that will force China to be Russians cannon fodder & not the other way around.
8884 2018-12-12 07:38:11 Imagine a world of such great intrigue, that the FBI would target an innocent man to protect their child trafficking ring and secret oil interests. You'll have to imagine it, because George pulled it out of his now-cavernous cornhole.

8890 2018-12-12 07:37:21 Some r asking why not any mention of crude oil prices but when recently the price of cride went up then they were not buying into this reason of worldwide crude prices being high. Cheap hypocrites. And even then the govt. didn't give in to pressure. Tried reducing global prices..

Good for Norway to invest its wealth on its future rather than let it be wasted on war & other extravagant crap. Oil revenue will disappear but Norway will still be strong.

8910 2018-12-12 07:34:56 The desire for economuc growth is the desire to sell oil.

8912 2018-12-12 07:34:32 Yeah, The US alphabet agency that overthrew Mossadegh in Iran in '53 in concert w/Western oil interests does not like the stable, secular "strong man" model (See: Syria). Their phony "liberation" agenda creates the chaos that enables religious nuts & U.S. corporate profits.
8913 2018-12-12 07:34:31 The cash wasn’t “found.” It was Iranian government investments and deposits in American banks that were frozen as sanctions. The money legally belonged to Iran. It was never confiscated.

The growing no. of un-immunized kids here are far more dangerous. Build a wall around them.

And they would have to try to negotiate with Canada who they just told to fuck off, in order to get oil to market. AND Trudeau just bought their pipeline. How would THAT go?

8948 2018-12-12 07:29:59 Thanks for the oil you the best lol
8949 2018-12-12 07:29:50 No , Their already talk about drop the USD used for trade standard , example oil will not be priced in USD anymore etc . China is use their debt over the USA in trade talks just think if they dump it .yet media don't tell you that make you think USD is safe lol not .

8956 2018-12-12 07:28:00 How was AOL a monopoly when Netscape, Netzero, etc. were available? In the STP case you HAD to buy STP oil, it was the only option.  Just because you don't like the other options doesn't make it a monopoly.
8957 2018-12-12 07:27:40 I guess hes trying to divide and conquer. 1st he gives equlization payments to Quebec. Then he blames Ontario for the oil sands phase out in the meantime hes done nothing to help Edmonton or the rest of Canada. Hopefully we'll all come together and vote him out.
8958 2018-12-12 07:27:35 Now do all of us that own private land farms ranch’s that have been forced to sell our land to Private Energy Companies to put in pipelines for their profit pay us the landowners a monthly royalty on all that travels through the pipelines just as an oil gas well royalty

8969 2018-12-12 07:25:52 World shall have Competition commission just as CCI in INDIA. Oil producing nations have  come together (OPEC) and raise oil prices without considering opinion of consumers.
8970 2018-12-12 07:25:43 Coconut oil gives less than half the yield per hectare that palm oil does. If we stop with palm oil, we'd need more space thus more animal death to grow enough. Palm Oil production is an issue, but most production is an issue under capitalism.

8980 2018-12-12 07:24:17 Glad that you are comfortable putting the UK’s management of oil in the same bracket as Venezuela. A useful comparative, I feel. Though I believe the U.K. makes considerably less revenue per barrel than those paragons of Capitalism.

8996 2018-12-12 07:22:06 Mexico imported about $1 billion of pork last year. Them imposing tariffs does not send any extra revenue to our government. How the hell you get $15 billion plus out of that to fund a wall is pure fantasy.

9071 2018-12-12 07:12:43 That’s not even close to true. Mexico retaliating with tariffs just means a decrease in demand and therefore less of that export for us. It is not them paying for the wall. Jesus, you people will find a way to defend any lie. He was bullshitting.

9140 2018-12-12 07:02:02 Alberta's oil supply happens to have a high concentration of sulphur, which is undesirable for final products, and costly to scrub out.
It is also predominantly heavy, which provides less gasoline yield, more heavy residue, than sweet or light.
It is, natures fault, lower quality
9141 2018-12-12 07:01:52 Well we have this data now so a) industry was noted somewhere in the process of making a contribution and b) as the article notes, the donations can be refunded and c) Beto could actually take a strong stance against oil and gas but d) he’s not going to
9142 2018-12-12 07:01:52 In the grocery business, margins are often below 5%.  Why should oil companies gouge us at  20%-43%?

9144 2018-12-12 07:01:36 I don't know but it's from the country that brought you homoerotic oil wrestling in leather capris so clearly there's some wisdom there somewhere!!!
9145 2018-12-12 07:01:14 do some research on the fed and federal reserve, do some research on the families who own the oil industry and where they from, should give you some insight lol

9153 2018-12-12 06:59:11 Well see, we can agree on our feelings about an oil company: That's awesome.

That said, again, let's put aside pride for a moment:

9159 2018-12-12 06:58:36 Maybe you should read the case of Famfa Oil Vs. Attorney General of the Federation, a new government can not shy aware from the liabilities of the previous ones. Whether that subsidy was a fraud then or not, this current government is bound to pay them.

9163 2018-12-12 06:58:14 this socialist government who have championed to shut down Alberta Oil for years before it took over our provincial coffers was accepted by disillusioned Albertans. Hopefully they will see the error in their ways
9164 2018-12-12 06:58:12 What about the crude oil prices?
9165 2018-12-12 06:58:03 ホントですね。元々元日SPって参入歴の浅い人たちが書いてましたよね。古沢さんも徳永さんも参入シーズンじゃなかったかしら。
個人的には松Ｐは相棒を簡単に交代可能な存在にしたことと官房長を退場させた２点で許せないんですがw、チャレンジ精神は旺盛でしたね。
9166 2018-12-12 06:57:50 "EIA expects that U.S. crude oil production will average 10.9 million b/d in 2018, up from 9.4 million b/d in 2017, and will average 12.1 million b/d in 2019". 
Т.е. на конец 2019 Управление видит добычу в США порядка 12,7 млн. б/д
9167 2018-12-12 06:57:42 Fish oil too (at high doses)? That's what I heard.

9185 2018-12-12 06:54:05 Typically, people understand "no money from oil and gas industry" as "no corporate donations". Why he couldn't just go with that pledge is beyond me, probably because he's a useless tool being hyped by salty Clintonites. But still, the standard seems entitely unreasonable.

9200 2018-12-12 06:51:32 Sometimes I think about my future and then get sad that global warming is a thing and governments are taxing consumers instead of taxing the producers; the oil companies. But alas that won’t happen so bye bye earth I guess

9203 2018-12-12 06:50:46 A way to prove Trump is a congenital liar is that he uses the phrase “I totally understand”. It’s undeniably true that this snake oil hawking demagogue has never “totally understood” anything from free market economics to female genitalia.

9209 2018-12-12 06:50:26 Oil refining is bad business, terrible for the communities in which is located. Look around in Louisiana, Texas, California in communities with these facilities, look at the pollution, the accidents, the toxicity, the cancer...Bad business.
9210 2018-12-12 06:50:13 Potato and spices but usually fried in lard. But unbelievably delicious. Some places may fry in other oil but my pink pastie experience is with Beaties on Tates Avenue. Friends of mine used to think it was a euphemism for something else.  it’s a must try!

9220 2018-12-12 06:48:23 November CPI data suggests that inflation is past its peak & could continue to fall in the coming months as adjustments to lower oil prices & energy-related components materialize.

9269 2018-12-12 06:40:09 I’ve eaten nothing but Mr Ventris pizza, Panera grilled cheeses and vending machine chips these last two weeks to the point where when I cut my self my blood tastes and smells like cooking oil. Lmao beat.

9273 2018-12-12 06:40:00 I have 2 things I rub my whole body in body lotion so I focus on smell and I have this lavender oil that I rub on my pols and nek so I don't focus on what's inside my head but I focus on what I smell 
9274 2018-12-12 06:39:51 All we can do is keep presenting the facts and hope the brainwashing wears off. My whole family are Trump supporters I piss them of on a daily basis by telling them they are being conned by this snake oil salesman.

9276 2018-12-12 06:39:20 I get adding stuff to pesto. That’s great! But don’t mix olive oil and cilantro together and neglect pine nuts or parm or basil and tell me this is pesto.
9277 2018-12-12 06:39:15 Love this - do you mind telling what you used? Oil, acrylic... What? I've been using crayons lately because they're handy. This doesn't look like crayons.
9278 2018-12-12 06:38:56 About them not telling you that they did it, and why -  if innocent, they'd be up front about it. 

Even if in your case they weren't hiding things, it is becoming common for workshops to do this and have owners discover falsified work records later on basics like oil changes.
9279 2018-12-12 06:38:54 Can't believe people fall for that shit. But then again lot of people fallen for the essential oil scam.

9288 2018-12-12 06:37:15 How much of our oil comes from Saudi/Qatar/UAE? And what tax will the EU stick on that to 'save the planet'?
9289 2018-12-12 06:37:11 So Saudi is implicated in 911, proven to have murdered a Virginia citizen with a bone saw and Canada keeps selling them tanks and buying their oil when Alberta can't sell its own? Please help me understand the power of #oil and #weapons #NLFAIL

9294 2018-12-12 06:36:43 It's pathetic to see her backtrack and try to buy votes by her new found love of oil. I think it is just a love of power that is the incentive here ;)
9295 2018-12-12 06:36:15 @shoffmanAB you are the minister of health, please research the proven links between oil refining, toxicity and cancer in the local communities. This is why Alberta has shown such wisdom in NOT doing this horribly dirty work in our BEAUTIFUL province. Let's keep it that way!
9296 2018-12-12 06:36:03 Usually, such products are priced steeply that buyers opt to buy the usual Bajaj Boxer. What's the price! The oil lobby is deeply entrenched, they wont let a simple 'innovation' disrupt business.

9315 2018-12-12 06:32:34 They are paying for it from belly place tariffs.  The Govt. gets paid back.

Thank you over production and decreased oil demand.
9320 2018-12-12 06:32:03 Once you’ve chosen to ignore murder for Saudi oil, trading humans for tariffs is no big deal at all.
9321 2018-12-12 06:31:53 The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar will hopefully discourage further oil and fossil fuel use, and in the UK we are doing well in the production of renewable energy; pollution from particulate matter is a particular problem in South London & elsewhere.

9339 2018-12-12 06:29:50 There's a separate place in advertising hell for companies that bring out products with names like 'My Doctor Pain Relief Oil' and 'Gokof' cough syrup. Ditto for their ad agencies.
9340 2018-12-12 06:29:43 There was also an article that explains how companies that also own refineries buy up all the capacity on a pipeline to keep competitors from accessing the pipeline.  Then they sell their own oil to their own refineries at a very low price - making the refineries more profitable
9341 2018-12-12 06:29:36 Your mouth is way too dirty for a dumb bird! I'm going to fry you in oil! When your real owner comes to get you I'm going to kill them!

9351 2018-12-12 06:27:48 Hardly hypocrisy at all. When an LNG pipeline leaks, The spilled product evaporates on it's own, unlike crude oil or bitumen, which remains liquid, and leaches into the food chain, causing increasing toxicity to the ecosystem as it goes.

9355 2018-12-12 06:27:16 Interest rates should take a break. RBI has been hawkish, generally overestimating inflation in the last couple of years. Oil prices are off their highs. Perhaps Guv Das will find the room to lower rates, and not fuel inflation.

9418 2018-12-12 06:16:23 The PCs increased spending by a whopping 19.6% in fiscal 2013-4 - that is, more than a year before any sign of a downturn in oil prices, which began in mid-2014.

Given we expect going into next year

Output Cuts
OPEC+ -1.2mb/d 
Canada -325kb/d

I think we have a strong case of price reversal however not to former highs but likely the upper band of #WTI at 55-60 & #BRENT at 65-70.

9422 2018-12-12 06:15:54 But palm oil is least responsible for deforestation than other sources of oil.   Do you believe if palm oil were from western countries it will get this stick? Soybeans is from western countries, it’s more responsible for deforestation, yet the campaign against it is so minimal.

9432 2018-12-12 06:15:15 I've been over this a few times, but I'll say it again: Electricity generation is not calculated into Equalization for good reason, it would screw the Western provinces even more, as your oil and gas would become factored twice: Once as a product, again as energy.

How does Trump’s wall stop this? Asking for a cartel friend.
9445 2018-12-12 06:12:58 Gladly. Look up the Énergie Saguenay Project, the StoltLNGaz Bécancour plant, or the Call for LNG Projects in Côte-Nord which began in August.

The only laziness I see here is the excuses for Alberta's failure to diversify beyond oil and gas.

9448 2018-12-12 06:12:41 Mexico will pay for the wall thru reduced remittances (Mexicans in the US sending money to Mexico). The revenue flow of US remittances into Mexico exceeds the revenue they make from oil exports. They will be paying substantial for that wall.
9449 2018-12-12 06:12:40 What I hear you saying is the oil workers can’t be bothered to learn a new trade as the economy slowly shifts from oil. Are you suggesting their skills are non-transferable or that they are just not smart? Or that you got stuck in the past and and refuse to grow up?

9511 2018-12-12 06:02:45 That is one method, others could be found. And whether or not a particular industry is bad for the environment depends on many details. If the input energy comes from 100% renewable electricity it would almost certainly be a net improvement on using fossil oil.

9537 2018-12-12 05:59:13 That is bullshit. The world has an undersupply of oil. The current price drop is due to Trump asking Saudi Arabia to lower the price. The fundamentals call for much higher prices. I trade oil, so don't pretend you know something I don't know.
9538 2018-12-12 05:58:54 They hate Igbos and they buy stuff from the Igbos? US is trying to stop other countries from buying oil from Iran. Iran considers that a hostile act. If all Nigerians hated Igbos like they often, Igbos would only sell to Igbos

9556 2018-12-12 05:54:56 In my personal after Chanukah/after donuts/latkes tradition, today is officially SMOSSFD(So Much Oil So Slim Fast Day) and it looks like it could turn into months!


9557 2018-12-12 05:54:52 I accidentally stuck my entire thumb in some frying oil and the worst thing is it didn’t even taste that good.

9560 2018-12-12 05:54:11 There is absolutely NO argument that justifies the rating making CBD oil illegal.

The fact  Govt would not allow it is a biggie for me.  I won't let my dog suffer and will go to jail if necessary to save her pain - but I damn well shouldn't have to break the law to care for her.
9561 2018-12-12 05:54:10 Al Gore should be in jail for crimes against humanity. He's a fear mongering, snake oil salesman. Greed has produced a lot more willing accomplices than Global warming's sheeple have produced actual facts.
9562 2018-12-12 05:53:52 Oil probably.
9563 2018-12-12 05:53:39 そらそうなるwww
9564 2018-12-12 05:53:28 Take “hair skin, & nails” vitamins! The pink bottle the capsule ones though! They make your hair grow QUICK!!! & try leaving on some tea tree oil & vitamin e oil on for a couple hours you can even sleep with it & wash it off in the morning!
9565 2018-12-12 05:53:15 Chicken bouillon oregano thyme Rosemary and a little bit of olive oil. And some butter after the fact because I'm American trash.
9566 2018-12-12 05:53:02 Yes!!!  Love this oil!  Truly helped in my recovery with my arm/elbow/wrist/hand/& fingers injury!!!  Ask me how!!!
9567 2018-12-12 05:52:55 Oh they face consequences. Have you been? Or know those who left for AB? people seek less EI from change in motivation in Newf or from high paid jobs incl in oil offshore /in AB? Long story short you seem to believe Atlantic Canada should be left poorer to face more consequences
9568 2018-12-12 05:52:29 Quality matters.  I just don't think it's a good cooking oil and hasn't been traditionally used as one.
9569 2018-12-12 05:51:36 That $2.69 national average sure isn't in my city in SoCAl. 
And we have oil refineries all over in the port area and in the bay area.
No reason we should have these high prices. Well, except corporate greed and govt self enrichment
9570 2018-12-12 05:51:31 Maybe they voted to take the oil from Iraq, kill the families of terrorists, do worst than waterboarding... Can you just stop with this terrible take? I don't know where to begin, it has multiple layers of wrong.
9571 2018-12-12 05:51:25 "Global warming"... "climate change"...  it's a hoax, a money making scam, a new age ponzi scheme, the latest line in snake oil for today's scale-y salesmen. 

And if you believe "climate change", they have a bridge for sale, downtown Manhattan... 
you'll just LOVE it. 
9572 2018-12-12 05:51:25 vaped some CBD oil tonight. can’t tell if it’s the wine i had earlier that has me so relaxed, or the oil. either way, i am soooo chill right now.
9573 2018-12-12 05:51:21 went to L'Occitane just now and tried their Almond Oil. it work wonders on my skin, feelin so fresh and super soft.  It smells good too. Harga pon ehem boleh tahan. Utk something similar to shower gel, for RM133 is quite tough. But its really good! #dilemma
9574 2018-12-12 05:51:17 Well I was 'watching' Salt Fat Acid Heat in the background but then she said '[some type of olive oil] is made without heat or chemicals'
*off*
Everything is chemicals. I know what you mean, but say what you *actually* mean.
#chemophobia
9575 2018-12-12 05:51:16 No they sure haven't . But there's obvious proof there's an overpopulation of cattle allotments . Oil rigs and fracking as well .
9576 2018-12-12 05:51:09 "..........."

Fries up some bacon. Flicks hot boiling oil onto the Tiger.
9577 2018-12-12 05:51:05 U.S. is now world's biggest oil producer. U.S. crude oil production will average nearly 11 million barrels per day in 2018 - EIA
9578 2018-12-12 05:50:52 Absolutely nothing is better than jumping into bed with freshly washed sheets after a hot shower and a long ass day. For bonus comfort, throw a little lavender essential oil in the diffuser. #GameOver
9579 2018-12-12 05:50:52 OK, but how do you tune up a horse? Change the oil and filters, check the belts...?
9580 2018-12-12 05:50:45 I have dry skin, I like Simple brand cream cleanser (can get at Shoppers), The Ordinary rosehip seed oil, Aquaphor to seal it all in.
9581 2018-12-12 05:50:36 I disagree with Peat on this one. Real olive oil is fine (make sure it's California or Chile). Also latest varieties of sunflower oil are OK.
9582 2018-12-12 05:50:34 I can shoot a gun, change my oil, clean the gutters, chop firewood, sew, knit, crochet, and bake. It’s amazing what one can do without worrying about gender labels.
9583 2018-12-12 05:50:21 Now we need to flood the market and destroy Russia's economy by dropping oil prices. That will get rid of Putin.
9584 2018-12-12 05:50:14 Los compraron abajo de 100 pesos m2... el tema es que estaban apalabrados con Hoteles, Fibras, etc que ahora ven que su gran negocio se les esfumó... y falta que les descubran sus rondas petroleras con prestanombres tipo Sierra Oil & Gas...
9585 2018-12-12 05:50:12 YEAH, THAT'S WHY IT WAS FLOWN OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN UNTRACEABLE CASH!  GEEZ, YA'LL ARE SO GULLIBLE!!!!!!
9586 2018-12-12 05:50:02 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

9593 2018-12-12 05:49:24 Well, the neolibs say “everyone in Texas gets their money from oil”, so yes, we should def care
9594 2018-12-12 05:49:23 It had nothing to do with Obama. He did everything he could to stop oil exploration on govt land. It was thanks to private landowners that we had the surge. It increased despite Obama's objections.

9598 2018-12-12 05:49:09 btw, fool - obama had a plan to reduce carbon emissions to near or at zero by 2040, which is why he poured billions into clean energy programs against republican objections..  hillary planned to increase those programs, which is why coal and oil donated millions to trump.

9600 2018-12-12 05:48:57 What Bullshit? Like best Economy in history. Lowest Unemployment in History. Or how about getting us off Foreign Oil? We need a wall. But dont worry i promise we will get the wall. Mark My Words. Chuck and Nancy both said we need Border Security. Military will Build it.
9601 2018-12-12 05:48:49 Mix a bit of lavender essential oil with water and rub it in your scalp. Typically helps me when I get my bad headaches!
9602 2018-12-12 05:48:49 We need MORE pipelines to get our product to tidewater in order to get the world price and ship all the oil we produce. It is indeed failures in Ottawa that have led to pipeline construction being vetoed (NG), regulated to death (EE), and on life support (TMX), instead of built
9603 2018-12-12 05:48:48 SUFA is best. Mufa like olive oil is meant as dressing not cooking. Use cooking oil your great grandparents recognise.  If solid at room temp, cooking, if liquid, for car.
9604 2018-12-12 05:48:44 having horrible flashbacks to the time Mac and cheese fell in the grates of my stove and when an entire bottle of avocado oil spilled on my kitchen floor

9606 2018-12-12 05:48:11 even here in malaysia BTS popularity spread to the locals. I know Malaysian ARMY are huge but now the locals even know them. Just this morning i heard Ddaeng blasting at Petron Oil Station. That's BTS unofficial release...like its been play like it was a main single
9607 2018-12-12 05:48:05 Do you know the reason the campaign against palm oil is so intensive?
9608 2018-12-12 05:47:58 Passing a stand alone bill would work and put them on the record, vast majority support this.
Worshipping at the altar of comprehensive immigration reform by both parties ensures this will never happen.
9609 2018-12-12 05:47:57 No but Shell doesn't own 55% of oil reserves. I agree but you must have more faith in the regulators than I do. It's a very unique scenario b/c decentralized systems are still so foreign to government regulators.

9614 2018-12-12 05:47:01 ASUU Strike - Day 38!

It took the FG about 48-hour to work out modalities to pay the outstanding N800b oil subsidy owed to Oil Marketers from 2015.

It's Day 38 and the FG is yet to work out modalities to meet ASUU's demand!

9618 2018-12-12 05:45:36 It’s funny considering his father and now himself generate income from oil and gas as well. Mostly I think he knows how much Alberta absolutely hates him.
9619 2018-12-12 05:45:17 If your skin gets too dry, your skin barrier gets damaged, which then causes increased oil production. Be nice to your skin for a while, use a product with more occlusives, and it will repair itself and your oil production will decrease!

9624 2018-12-12 05:44:55 So, you prefer to open our borders to all who want to come into our country? Because that's what Trudeau's brand of globalism is.  On oil, I'd like to know how we maintain an industry while we work to phase it out.  That's contradictory by any measure..

9631 2018-12-12 05:44:34 Blender pesto! Make sure garlic is roughly chopped, and it’s with salt and oil at BOTTOM of blender.

Curry: always make sure your spices sauté in oil BEFORE any water or other non-oil liquid added. Browns em, maximizes flavor.

9638 2018-12-12 05:44:00 The #ERA was defeated tonight because @davejenkinsva introduced a resolution opposing offshore oil drilling last month and several members of the @CityofNN  did not appreciate having to vote for it. As a consequence, they tanked the ERA resolution. Politics at its worst.
9639 2018-12-12 05:43:51 Ran out of oil heat today. Thankful for an old kerosene heater. 1st time in our lives the kids and I won’t celebrate the holiday. No . No decorating. No gifts. And other mishaps. 

Can’t wait to see next weeks installment of “I married a sociopath”. Bring it!
9640 2018-12-12 05:43:46 Oil is still so cute 
9641 2018-12-12 05:43:40 I need CBD and THC for the analgesic effects to work on me but just straight CBD is wonderful for my anxiety, it helps with acid reflux for me as well. I use Elixinol brand no flavorings suspended in coconut oil. A dropper full sublingual and no panic attacks!
9642 2018-12-12 05:43:34 Funny how she cares about oil, right as a election is in the near future
9643 2018-12-12 05:43:31 And the U.S. has been positioning its military around the west coast Ghana playing a huge host. They will protect their interests and ensure that whichever faction is able to hold on to their oil would be supported to produce and export. Libya, Iraq. How's Basra doing?

9649 2018-12-12 05:42:26 Don't mind his delusions.. now at d days when:
1. Grass is been cut with over 200 million naira
2. Oil subsidy is been paid but always refuted to be paid.
3. Billion of dollars oil contracts are been signed without appropriation.
4. Money allegedly recovered are been relooted.
9650 2018-12-12 05:42:08 But wait , Barack Obama says that he is responsible for America’s oil independence.  The truth of coarse is that Obama did everything he could to hurt energy independence. Federal Permits declined. It was the States (Texas mostly) that went around him. Despite him. Yeah !

9662 2018-12-12 05:39:38 There is nothing ethical about Alberta tar sands. It takes enormous amounts of fresh water to produce leaving toxic tailings ponds. It's the dirtiest oil on the planet.  #KeepItInTheGround
9663 2018-12-12 05:39:32 3) the Keystone pipeline is back on hold because of oil leaks. 4) There was never a war against coal, countries all over the world are moving away from it for cleaner more efficient alternatives. 5)Still no trade deal with China.

9666 2018-12-12 05:39:16 True...when cruide oil prices were dipping , they were busy in increasing taxes in name of economy revival , when it increased they we're sleeping till ppl didn't started protest..They should stop taking middle class for granted.

9668 2018-12-12 05:39:06 It might be a close call compared to the 1996 Chretien tax credits for the oil sands industry (ACCA) that the Harper conservatives kiboshed in 2015 as part of their efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.

9671 2018-12-12 05:38:24 It's complicated  But I would start with two things 1) cheap food is food higher in refined carbohydrate, sugar, and veg oil, providing the calories & metabolic milieu that seem to predict diabetes, and 2) the income gap in the U.S. has been growing steadily since 1980.

9686 2018-12-12 05:36:58 It’s a great point! Also building new refineries or expanding existing ones will take years. This is not an immediate solution. At all! A huge new fleet of oil railcars may be the only “short-term” fix, & even that is at least a year away from (literally) getting on track
9687 2018-12-12 05:36:54 They don't like our "dirty" oil but they want the money? How can they even justify their stance on Canadian oil while at the same time importing billions of dollars worth from a country with a deplorable human rights record?

9695 2018-12-12 05:35:20 How about simply re-directing even some of the billions in oil & gas tax subsidies to renewables & then let’s talk & compare? It’s past due that big oil lobbyists get shut down, or at least reduced significantly.

9711 2018-12-12 05:33:11 Fischer–Tropsch fuel synthesis was developed extensively in Nazi Germany and South Africa - the only thing it is really good for is getting around geopolitical or military sanctions on access to oil. It is worse for the environment, worse for CO2 and worse for EROEI.
9712 2018-12-12 05:33:05 Fact is since you mentioned oil. The USA is now (thanks to Trump) producing and exporting oil for the first time. Umm you don’t do your homework before tweeting do you? Typical just sling hatred.

9727 2018-12-12 05:31:18 Where to start...  post-nation state; globalist; against development of Canadian resources while turning a blind eye to foreign oil coming in by the tanker full; buys off the media; signs a compact which opens the door to loss of our sovereignty...
9728 2018-12-12 05:31:16 Still over $3 in Seattle area. 

Oil companies are restricting supply to raise prices to their equilibrium.

Remember a few years ago Saudis tanked barrel prices to $50?

Prices quickly fell (I paid $1.99/gal!!!) 

Low and behold! Here we are again.
9729 2018-12-12 05:31:02 But oil is the biggest economy in the province, the biggest employer and the biggest supplier of government finance. Of course there’s more than oil but come on.

9732 2018-12-12 05:30:45 That’s called lack of planning. Perhaps their anger should be directed at Albertas lack of Leadership going back 3 decades. The oil party train has to slowdown at some point. Markets naturally go up & down & sometimes in a severe way.
9733 2018-12-12 05:30:44 CPI tomorrow as well. Is everyone forgetting that headline inflation is probably going to get whacked due to the move in #oil? One of the reasons that I still think $$$ has risks to the downside near term. $dxy
9734 2018-12-12 05:30:34 "Deception" could provide insights on how rifts form and where oil could be found in still unexplored places, on how penguins and seals live, and on what is so special about the whales of Antarctica.

9739 2018-12-12 05:29:59 true, but he just lost senate race, it's a huge leap. plus, he takes tons of $$ from Big Oil and won't support Medicare for All. People think he's a progressive rock star, but it's a lot of hype.
9740 2018-12-12 05:29:48 so you think you can say oil off the shetlands is english? aye right why haven't we claim norwegian oil as our too
9741 2018-12-12 05:29:47 Good. Then that make a line in the sand to who we should be trusting. And SA oil isnt needed. We are the number one producer and exporter of oil. We make more $ exporting and importing oil than just keeping and using our own. That should end.
9742 2018-12-12 05:29:44 I mean, how much have we given away in tax breaks and incentives to oil companies?  I’d argue that and a bigger boondoggle. And this line.....

9756 2018-12-12 05:28:02 Get your facts straight....

9761 2018-12-12 05:27:34 Africa is rich is not the same as Africa has wisely used its resources. Most of the money looted from Africa by Africans are in western banks. Most of the wealth is still unexploited but its there. GDP measures production/exploitation it doesn't measure the oil in the ground.
9762 2018-12-12 05:27:22 The oil in the Somali region will be taken by Ethiopia. They will develop their lands but exclude the Somali region. This is because we don't have a United front with all Somalis in the region. It's shameful but that's what happens.

Point is they were in a sweet spot with low oil prices but they did sweet bugger all with that opportunity.
9807 2018-12-12 05:21:28 There is more to Alberta than oil let’s get our financial house in order including sales tax
9808 2018-12-12 05:21:21 Forget oil. 
Forget jobs
Forget military supplies
Forget exports
Forget attacks 
Is getting realistic such a difficult climb?
9809 2018-12-12 05:21:18 The Saudi prince will NEVER be charged or CONVICTED of this killing. Case closed! If Hillary Clinton was President she would do the same as Trump & it wouldn’t even be news. In the end nothing will happen. Condemning them might anger them & oil prices may go up!!!!
9810 2018-12-12 05:21:06 Fair, and the problem is always exacerbated by what’s behind him on the depth chart. I don’t know many teams where the drop off is as  steep.
9811 2018-12-12 05:21:06 I mean there might be that but it’s not what caused the issue. I put oil in. That’s all I did. It was running fine, now it’s not.
9812 2018-12-12 05:21:02 I totally agree. 
It's a real pity Chloe et al didn't take the opportunity to ensure CBD oil was more available to those suffering on going pain - I need it for my dog who has negative affects on vets meds, but our MP's prefer our animals & people to suffer.
9813 2018-12-12 05:20:59 i just wanna rub you. lather you up in beard oil. & lay in your lap til i fall asleep. ://
9814 2018-12-12 05:20:50 You should be asking why Oliver North received money from Iran during the contras.....
9815 2018-12-12 05:20:46 Venezuela and other OPEC member states have access to the sea yet like Canada, they are feeling the heat of low prices. The dynamics of oil & gas industry are too complex for an HR paper pusher.

9821 2018-12-12 05:19:53 Those are really good for you tbh and they actually work!! The oil diffuser is good for relaxation, and the salt lamp just provides overall calmness( a stress reliever)
9822 2018-12-12 05:19:51 True. It's sad how much we're genuinely fucked just because some rich car and oil board directors and ceos just wanted money.

9826 2018-12-12 05:19:34 Everyone who worked in the oil industry knew another bust would come eventually, and now the oil industry is automating, so some of the jobs are lost forever. The world is changing and we have to adjust to the changes as best we can.

9835 2018-12-12 05:18:17 Western art museums like the Gilcrease are great because by the time oil money poured into those towns the European and eastern masters had all been bought up. So the western money bought under appreciated western art, and their collections are fabulous in that field.

9843 2018-12-12 05:17:37 We won't be using any of the oil from the Kinder Morgan expansion, so we don't need any new pipelines. We can easily make do with what we have and start working on decreasing that.
9844 2018-12-12 05:17:18 despite everything, I remade a $32 bottle product we sell at work today by using oils I bought off amazon and putting it in a spray bottle with water:

9847 2018-12-12 05:17:03 Yes, Alberta owns oil which could be developed into energy. Does it not have ample sun and wind that could do likewise?

9929 2018-12-12 05:07:01 Canada in its present form can’t survive without oil. Either we get it from Alberta where we can control the environmental impact or we can get it from Saudi Arabia where we have no control. There is no other way. Everything else is rainbows and unicorns.

9945 2018-12-12 05:05:03 No water on my oil diffuser 
9946 2018-12-12 05:04:59 If Iran controls Yemen, they control the ability to attack both shipping routes coming out of the oil rich regions. Yes, the US military could make short work of them if they started firing silkworms at ships, but why allow it to get to even that point?
9947 2018-12-12 05:04:46 年末まで3日も休みがあって羨ましいです。
9948 2018-12-12 05:04:45 data is not the new oil, but a lubricant to make companies more efficient @IdeoInsider
9949 2018-12-12 05:04:41 I use Olbus Oil for the same reason! It’s amazing for helping relax muscle spasms/relieve muscle spasm pain!!
9950 2018-12-12 05:04:37 Roast six cloves of garlic with olive oil and salt and pepper then eat them.. #duh lol.. heals your body within 24 hours. Good luck boo.
9951 2018-12-12 05:04:37 I used to be a carpenter.  Saw lots of blood, buddies lose fingers or keep what was left of them, and literally watched a guy die on the job getting crushed between two scissor lifts . . . .

I have a story too: guy lost his leg on a Texas Oil rig... became waiter at "La Bare."
9952 2018-12-12 05:04:28 We landed on the moon and dinosaur bones turn into oil. How are we able to still find fossils? 
9953 2018-12-12 05:04:24 Alberta bill 101, Quebec must label in larger fonts on all product, "BROUGHT TO YOU COURTESY OF ARAB OIL" Otherwise they don't have the social lic........ Ah forget it lets just ban all Quebec products.
9954 2018-12-12 05:04:15 I caught that, too! What a slap in the face for middle America. He is why our Founding Fathers created the Electoral College. North Dakota, @SenSchumer produces more oil than Venezuela!
9955 2018-12-12 05:03:58 They are saying when it comes to oil to mix it up with EVO, canola, flax, hemp,  and avocado because they all have different omega fatty acids ratios. And to excluded soy and corn oil because they increase inflammation and estrogen in men. Ant thoughts?
9956 2018-12-12 05:03:55 Economic opportunity including natural resources are usually much more powerful than governments. Gov matters less. US has incompetent president but the economy remains fairly resilient. His choices can affect economy too. Did AB / Newf culture change first or oil opp changed ppl
9957 2018-12-12 05:03:50 The oil packet is just pork fat and tiny scraps. It's pretty tasting.
9958 2018-12-12 05:03:43 So when there’s no more oil after you ban the companies, you will just voluntarily give up all of the products and technologies you rely on that are derived from oil? That would include the products not derived from oil but are delivered to you. How are you going to eat?
9959 2018-12-12 05:03:36 Hahhha before that where the oil was going? Asking Zafarazam...
Bewaqoof ministers ..logo to #thootia bna raha hai
9960 2018-12-12 05:03:35 CLS diesel?  Why oh why do Americans hate diesel cars?!  I need an MB oil burner!
9961 2018-12-12 05:03:24 not sure if its a moisturizer but i use the innisfree blemish care emulsion with bija seed oil
it helps with blemishes and keeps my skin moisturized
9962 2018-12-12 05:03:22 Pretty sure our president traded this man's life for cheap oil.
9963 2018-12-12 05:03:14 I use the shea moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo and the raw shea butter restorative conditioner. The castor oil shampoo I think has helped my hair to grow and the conditioner helps w the hydration but I also use repair masques and products that keep my hair alive
9964 2018-12-12 05:03:10 Ference; "Dallas Eakins was a fantastic coach, & a scape goat" & the team was drinking till 3 am. The guy who Eakins made captain, was lousy, & wouldn't retire when he couldn't play to get free money for 2 years. How bout you shutup now dickhead & go back to trying to stop oil...
9965 2018-12-12 05:02:56 No. The saudis are good guys. Nothing to do with oil or guns.
9966 2018-12-12 05:02:29 Bomb-ass chicken recipe:

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Oil up 4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts and give them a nice rubdown with salt, pepper, basil, and orgegano.

Bake 30 min or until 165°F inside thiccest part.

Toss some biscuits in at the 15 min mark if you a real G.
9967 2018-12-12 05:02:29 Why are you exempting 80% of oil and gas extraction in the country then? Your plan is basically the equivalent of, "We're running out of water! Let's pour a bottle of Nestle back into the Seymour reserves..." #cdnpoli
9968 2018-12-12 05:02:27 I have concerns about them all, particularly in light of IPCC’s recent #climatecrusis report. Bitumen is the worst. In salmon run rivers it will kill the salmon (studies). It does not float (popular oil industry talking points) and it cannot be cleaned up out of the ocean
9969 2018-12-12 05:02:21 10% in Co2 reduction for using B10? Must be joking, right? So coincidentally that the deforestation for palm oil plantations also contributed 10% to global warming.
9970 2018-12-12 05:02:11 How’s JP doing?  Why is Lucic being singled out?
9971 2018-12-12 05:01:59 put too much peppermint essential oil on my neck and it feels like someone cut me open and filled me with ice
9972 2018-12-12 05:01:49 The opportunities to deploy dollars and earn risk-adjusted returns have reduced because lending opportunities to the oil and gas sector dried up and pressure on the central bank to defend the naira also waned
9973 2018-12-12 05:01:44 I move my feet all the time and flick my fingers back and forth against each other. I also drum or tap things a lot. But favourite thing is making popping sounds with an aluminium drink can. I used to get in trouble for playing with an old oil can my dad had and making a mess. :|
9974 2018-12-12 05:01:44 Meeting at kota kemuning today and i was blur throughout the meeting.. i dont even know anything about oil and gas.
9975 2018-12-12 05:01:39 Now tanking up on thc so I can go shower- taking oil tabs, have taken some thc capsules. Once showered, I have to wait until my hair dries before I can go to bed because Vanity, thy name is NearlySeniorCitizen :)
9976 2018-12-12 05:01:33 But I'm being truthful here, ask any Yoruba person...

Ororo is "Vegetable oil"...
9977 2018-12-12 05:01:31 I got a water bottle, a slash of cleaning vinegar & lavender essential oil and it didn’t make mine smell bad. Using bleach and that sort of cleaning supplies can make them want to potty in that spot more.
9978 2018-12-12 05:01:25 When the crude oil went down and hit as low as 30$, 
during 3 years after 2014, the price reduction not passed on to the customers, the people. The government acted as middleman. Less, stable freight rates and price of goods would have brought feeling of good times.
9979 2018-12-12 05:01:25 They're shielding O&G from a lot of the carbon tax. They've finally talked to provinces and First Nations to get pipelines built. They've invested in the TM pipeline.

Maybe leave the O&G talk to people who've worked in Oil and Gas.
9980 2018-12-12 05:01:22 You da man, Bruh! Big oil’ fat juicy Congratulations!!! 
9981 2018-12-12 05:01:12 no reason at all for the party being over - canadian oil trapped for political manoeuvring - you admit to benefitting from past oil booms your family too - but now those still here can’t?
9982 2018-12-12 05:00:56 Канада в октябре т.г. значительно увеличила экспорт канолы

Согласно данным экспертов Oil World, экспорт канолы из Канады в октябре т.г. увеличился до 1,43 млн. тонн против 556 тыс. тонн в сентябре.

9985 2018-12-12 05:00:30 You wanna talk about subsidies?! Do you know what kind of subsidies the oil and gas companies are getting? The royalties we get and the jobs created are abysmal. Green jobs are better paying and there are more of them per dollar invested.
9986 2018-12-12 05:00:06 And yet Saudi oil is exempt from all the restrictions we place on ourselves. Go figure.
9987 2018-12-12 04:59:59 Me: my ear hurts and i can’t hear

Build that pipe!
9999 2018-12-12 04:58:38 ‘Green’ energy can’t survive without government subsidies. Until you come up with a real viable energy source that can truly replace oil, stopping pipelines will only deteriorate our country further. You should focus on banning Saudi oil tankers. You oppose that, I’m sure.
