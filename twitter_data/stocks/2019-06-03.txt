1 2019-06-03 23:58:28 Why is Trump trying to run the country when he's so incompetent?
- Tax cuts for rich and corporations exploded deficit & pushed debt to $22T
- #TrumpTariffs created a new tax for consumers. Farmers needed a $28B bailout
- Stocks down 6% since May 1
- Bond market signals recession
2 2019-06-03 23:57:53 The NASDAQ is down over 300 points, primarily due to FANG stocks taking a dive. Happy now?
3 2019-06-03 23:57:39 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $LTR was 19% Positive, with $SPX 8% Positive. #ASX
4 2019-06-03 23:55:40 If this is the case you are not any better than those that pump and dump, and please don't come back with "trying to save people" because if that was the case you would be working for a non-profit or a charity and not involved in stocks.
5 2019-06-03 23:55:36 Same goes for growth stocks (stocks who'd value is derived from their expected growth in revs/earnings). Lower taxes will mean better economic environment, more demand, and more reinvestment for faster growth. This gets priced in day 1.
6 2019-06-03 23:55:19 I gave Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt hoping he was good for America but the last month of his tenure as POTUS he has alienated the world, tech stocks and had turned the market into a bear market. He will not have my vote next year.

Then bitcoin comes for gold.
Then bitcoin comes for altcoins, penny stocks and junk bonds.
Then bitcoin comes for investment grade bonds and bluechips. 
Then bitcoin comes for real estate and treasuries.
8 2019-06-03 23:54:06 Yeah. That's exactly what happens. Expected earnings for corps are higher when a pres who wants low taxes gets elected than when a highcorporate tax pres gets elected. Expected cashflows are discounted to present dollars & divided by # of stocks. That's how many stocks are valued

38 2019-06-03 23:46:47 Time to organise them sawine stocks
39 2019-06-03 23:46:37 @Percell_12 was looking for Birkenstocks at DSW today. Sadly they were Birk-out-of-stocks..
40 2019-06-03 23:45:07 Question is... meron bang stocks, policies & assets? 
41 2019-06-03 23:44:54 I am not able to follow more than 5/6 stocks. How do you follow about 45. Hats off to you.
42 2019-06-03 23:44:04 @realDonaldTrump if you do with suppressor what you did with bumpstocks, you can kiss 2020 bye bye. Most gun owners gave bump stocks a pass because they don’t use them. However, every gun owner thinks suppressors should be removed from the NFA. @NRA
43 2019-06-03 23:43:44 The day has come.

I was told by a worker in the women’s dept. that they wouldn’t have my size and I would need to go look in the children’s section. 

I am 20 years old. I drive my own car. I invest in stocks. And I am currently searching for a blazer in the children’s dept.
44 2019-06-03 23:43:23 If you just started I’d follow jim cramer as well as his TheStreet. Adam Feuerstein, though we once had a back and forth argument in our blogs, but he’s relevant in bio stocks at Statnews. I read 10k’s, q’s, ASCO abstracts, bio peer reviews, etc. Like homework lol. Good luck!
45 2019-06-03 23:42:12 Trump banned bump stocks. Know your facts.
46 2019-06-03 23:40:46 No one will benefit except Germany and Infineon. Deals are horrible for stocks, retirements, capitalism, and justice.
47 2019-06-03 23:39:36 I learnt how to trade stocks and I am so addicted to it now. All the studying and learning is so worth it. It’s good to have someone who’s gone ahead of you showing you what and how to responsibly use the blessing that God brings your way.
48 2019-06-03 23:39:34 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
49 2019-06-03 23:39:29 Soccer stocks*
But yes causing havoc on every platform.
50 2019-06-03 23:37:24 Put him in the stocks and watch the crowd numbers surge...
51 2019-06-03 23:36:32 But, Mr. Dean... wouldn’t you say there’s a method to his madness? He tweets threatens, escalating his tariff war w/ Mexico, China, Canada etc to influence the stock market? He gets info on the economy, causing stocks to rise or fall... he didn’t disinvest, he benefits from it
52 2019-06-03 23:34:21 1000%. He has been in the Hollywood, Wall Street, stocks, Real estate etc World for over 30 yrs military n people in high place and politicians incognito have been pushing him to run for office. He knows them better then they know themselves
53 2019-06-03 23:34:18 I have to agree with that. I didn’t think bump stocks should have been banned, though I don’t own one. But, someone owning a legal suppressor has been vetted by every authority and gone through a near-year-long wait for the tax stamp. Ban them, you can ban anything.
54 2019-06-03 23:33:39 U holding it ..taught you sold all your Bio stocks
55 2019-06-03 23:32:48 When are you going to walk back some of your statements? Bump stocks ARE banned. There’s no classification for guns called “assault rifles” (it’s a media made-up word). The NRA doesn’t sell guns and promotes gun safety.
56 2019-06-03 23:32:01 Maybe a wantonly errant House of Representatives, but never a complicit United States Senate. Guessing they never could have imagined Ak-47’s and bump stocks either.
57 2019-06-03 23:31:47 When IT is going to be available tradestation..I is hard for me to out my orders on my fhone
58 2019-06-03 23:29:42 Trump banned bump stocks and wants to ban suppressors next. Why don’t you worry about him instead of a dem candidate who won’t be the nominee? #2A
59 2019-06-03 23:28:15   We all know the #TaxScam only let the top 1% take more $$ from us. Middle class pays MORE in taxes, deficit skyrockets, GOP borrows more and more from banks, foreign & domestic, that WE will have to pay back while Trump & 1%ers buy back stocks & get richer.
60 2019-06-03 23:27:22 Doing myself a favor today and NOT checking my stocks. #StockMarket #NASDAQ #TSLA
61 2019-06-03 23:25:26 Assault rifles and bump stocks are already banned. As far as high capacity mags, they have only been used in one mass shooting. Why ban it?
62 2019-06-03 23:25:14 Do you want more stocks buybacks?
63 2019-06-03 23:24:10 @SenGillibrand Hey Dumbo,  NRA doesn’t sell guns!  Bump stocks are banned as are “ military style” rifles since 1987.  You need to stop your LIES AND GET EDUCATED!
64 2019-06-03 23:24:03 I need too learn stocks
65 2019-06-03 23:23:12 A Small Business Owner isn’t worth 232million dollars. Delaney accumulated wealth by profiting from health care industry, and holding stocks in it. His investment Corp invested in small to medium businesses, but it was a huge business.
66 2019-06-03 23:21:09 Do you think that Government/Central bank meddling in the economy distorts prices and generates market cycles? It does not seem like you believe this to be the case. IMO true price discovery of US stocks has not occured yet.
67 2019-06-03 23:21:05 Ma parece que el maíz está jugado, Implica stocks apretados y una mejora del precio...
68 2019-06-03 23:20:30 @Lukewearechange did you see the stocks of Amazon, Facebook and Google all dropped today? Is it a coincidence that this was announced after the Bilderburg meetings? I wonder if any of the attendees owned any of those stocks and what they may have done with them?
69 2019-06-03 23:20:00 @ianlopuch i have a dumb question. I started a new position of 100 shares of WTR and was qualified for the dividend that paid out on June 1st and on a DRIP. It is June 3rd and no dividend nor increase in shares. Does this happen with some stocks where it takes a few days to get?
70 2019-06-03 23:19:37 exactly, i dont have any stocks nor will ever have that luxury, <<< work till i croke and some
71 2019-06-03 23:19:30 記録的な不漁(ふりょう)によりイカも無尽蔵(むじんぞう)ではないことを知る
Record shortage of squid a signal that stocks may not always last
72 2019-06-03 23:18:56 Wait , aren’t most penny stocks scams? But ohh how they run'!!!!!!!
73 2019-06-03 23:18:31 Tomorrow will be a special day, to see if we are at an inflection point, or not. Until then Cash is King.
