I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts
143 2018-07-30 23:42:11 If your going to strip naked except for black socks, cover yourself in baby oil and run around your mansion singing Madonna's greatest hits, you need to be able to hear it in every room! EVERY ROOM!
144 2018-07-30 23:42:07 Plamers shea oil makes me smell like chocolate 
145 2018-07-30 23:41:55 Straight coconut oil and water.
146 2018-07-30 23:41:54  just oil? You are ridiculous. And the bushes were involved in domestic drilling which means lowering dependence on foreign nations like the Middle east so if anything they would be a boon to the Islamist in that regard. Wake up and read a book and learn how the market works
147 2018-07-30 23:41:49 Just burn my self frying chicken my ass couldn’t dodge that oil popping quick enough 
148 2018-07-30 23:41:41 put coconut oil on your hair for a few hours or you can even sleep with it
149 2018-07-30 23:41:17 Isa only likes the guys I date if he can get something out of it........he’s rooting for the European mechanic rn so he can get free oil changes 
150 2018-07-30 23:41:16 Mr. Painter, Where do you stand on universal health care, women's rights, the environment vs. big oil, increasing taxes on the 1% to bring back the middle class, gay rights, $15 min. wage, etc. I'm a very concerned Liberal!
151 2018-07-30 23:41:05 Oh, thank you, the simple cleansing oil is good for you?
152 2018-07-30 23:41:00 yeah no oil ocean sucks penis

155 2018-07-30 23:40:32 1958: man sits under car while changing the oil because manliness.
2018: me sharing my Poshmark closet while the oil drains because innovative.

158 2018-07-30 23:40:02 "pussy better come clean like tide" brother Denzel has had years to write and he actually said that. "legend like urban" "on my yes julz mixed with katy perry shit" "im so cold that i jack frost" "talk is slick like its oil speaking" i didnt even have to hunt for these whack bars
159 2018-07-30 23:39:53 I’m not the one to disrespect because we all know my mouth slicker than a can of oil.
160 2018-07-30 23:39:37 To all the recipients of my oil shipments, keep an eye on the mail slots this week for a painfree weekend ahead!!!! Keep fighting and dont give up as we are making some headway in the fight, slow but steady as she goes
161 2018-07-30 23:39:35 I oiled my decking seats on the weekend and 3 hours later it rained. The oil is inconsistent and patchy. Does this mean I have to sand the wood back and start again?
162 2018-07-30 23:39:27 I can't believe that one of my residents came to my room last Saturday until he was telling me to put some green oil on my hair while he told me to wash my hair with the Head and Shoulders shampoo after he was brushing my hair with the red hairbrush and he's mean to me!!! 
163 2018-07-30 23:39:22 @ComicDaveSmith Thank you for having @LarrySharpe on your show. I listened to the WHOLE thing - even through an oil change!! FANTASTIC show!! #SharpeHollister2018 #ANewNY #Sharpe4Gov #Libertarian

167 2018-07-30 23:38:48 Bit random but I love the smell of the oil in locks  lol maybe that’s why I’ve came back to it all these yrs 
168 2018-07-30 23:38:42 夏になるとあまり考えずにからのペットボトルに水道水入れて冷やして飲んでるんだけど（味がどうこうなのはともかく）あんまよくないんかね。湯冷ましにしたほうがいいんだろうけど、会社ではできんしな

172 2018-07-30 23:37:32 Does ginger oil help swollen ankles?
173 2018-07-30 23:37:22 Yeah it’s good, I put too much olive oil in it tho
174 2018-07-30 23:37:19 シャイニングでもプレミアムでも構わんが、根本的な人員不足、人口減少を改善せねば意味がないぞと
175 2018-07-30 23:37:10 He just gets the edible oil. So it doesn’t have the THC in it, so it won’t show on a drug test or cause any side effects. He put it under his tongue and it dissolves into his blood stream. I’ve been looking into trying it for other problems for awhile now as well
176 2018-07-30 23:37:09 someone hang out with me after I get this oil change
177 2018-07-30 23:37:03 OIL IS SCARY I'M A BABY....
178 2018-07-30 23:37:03 Any thoughts on some of those who profess excessive love for coconut oil? ...Something regarding medium chain triglycerides. Is it really a superior oil?
179 2018-07-30 23:36:50 It will only happen if it increases The Oil Companies profits.
180 2018-07-30 23:36:41 If ginger oil will reduce swollen ankles let me know please!
181 2018-07-30 23:36:37 Has there ever been a time when oil hasn't been able to meet demand... nope.
182 2018-07-30 23:36:33 motor oil isnt for drinking
183 2018-07-30 23:36:30 A lot of women work construction. I’ve seen 3 women working on one oil field. What do you think women were doing during WWII when all the men were at war? They were mechanics, plumbers, construction workers. You really shouldn’t underestimate women.

186 2018-07-30 23:35:51 We are going to get some tomorrow hopefully for me to try. Does he use just the oil or edibles in them? Etc?
187 2018-07-30 23:35:50 Special food is when it’s perfect such as the chicken and shrimp Alfredo from Vapianos when the right person makes it with extra garlic and onions and then you pour the olive and the chili oil yourself in zig zag lines. It’s amazing everytime
188 2018-07-30 23:35:49 1000 mg of krill oil daily. Ride a bike or walk for 15 minutes if you can then stretch. Foam rolling. Go to physio if all else fails, not chiro.
189 2018-07-30 23:35:42 Lavender oil 
190 2018-07-30 23:35:41 Just got home from working for the day. Had to stop and get an oil change before I actually came home. Haven't been to the grocery store in weeks. There's no food here. So I'm getting ready to drag myself there. 

Monday is REALLY a Monday today.

193 2018-07-30 23:34:54 In all sense of sincerity if you can do anything to help my country Nigeria you would have solved 50 percent of world poverty in a go.... My people are our own problem, there love this Egypt so well because of the oil money, if you help.............
Thanks
194 2018-07-30 23:34:36 Why target the Russian people just because their oil & gas are publicly owned? You mean to punish them for experimenting with socialism?

Oil. 
Qaddafi’s gold and silver currency threatening to make the euro unstable.
Some say it was because Libyan rebels were tired of Qaddafi.
198 2018-07-30 23:33:33 Norway has a very small population and is very wealthy with North Sea oil money they put in a trust. Their model doesn’t translate well to very populated places that don’t have those reserves.
199 2018-07-30 23:33:32 So if Norway can own the majority of Equinor, why cant our democratic system we adhere to keep the oil that is pumped for sale within the province? IS THIS THE DEAL CETA GOT US???? I thought they were coming for our services like ambulances and health care not our resources.

202 2018-07-30 23:33:23 @spittinchiclets  loved the last two interviews.  As a fan of the Oil hearing the Lucic/ Maroon perspective was aces....great questions by @RearAdBsBlog .  You guys rule!

205 2018-07-30 23:33:11 "Small business" is a GOP dog whistle for "Any business WE consider small".
Much like "...defend our friends, allies, and NAT'L INTERESTS". That last part means ANYTHING else we want to kill for; oil, resources, OUR kind of democracy.
206 2018-07-30 23:33:04 My dad also uses CBD oil for his anxiety and although I haven’t tried it, it’s worked wonders for him.
207 2018-07-30 23:33:02 #jiffylube 1st time they forgot to install a new washer on the drain plug. 2nd time they did not tighten oil filter and oil was dripping from the filter. This happened 11 yrs ago never ever would I use them again. #jiffylube

226 2018-07-30 23:30:44 It's only going to get more contentious. Mexico is such a vulnerable country to climate change that I would hope politicians would take seriously their responsibility to reduce dependency on oil and gas... but nope.
227 2018-07-30 23:30:43 In Indiana, you can't even get that. They denied a kid w/ cancer CBD oil.

Then spritzed my face with Evian water spray and used @pacificabeauty coconut water gel. #selfcare #selflove #skincare #summerrelaxation
233 2018-07-30 23:29:49 Meh, people thought peak oil would happen years ago,
Technology changed that.
We are now one of the largest oil producers in the world,
We have massive coal and natural gas reserves.
Fly over the country some time.
So much wilderness.
This country is in great shape.

239 2018-07-30 23:28:44 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
240 2018-07-30 23:28:26 Considering that Alberta’s bitumen is less GHG-intensive than oil from Venezuela and parts of California (Kern River) he’s right to do so...
241 2018-07-30 23:28:18 Don't forget 7010553 (other oil companies are available)
242 2018-07-30 23:28:11 Easy there ....feeling a little triggered are you? First off "Canada" is not aligned with OPEC in any way and they trade their oil in US dollars as do must nations. Any sum of money in US currency greater than 10k is tracked by the US.
243 2018-07-30 23:27:57 did i just do cannabis oil off a drag queen in danny byrne’s? yes. yes i did.

245 2018-07-30 23:27:26 TBH I was surprised the Jays got the return they did esp considering they had no leverage. There was zero chance they could bring him back.
246 2018-07-30 23:27:22 not entirely. 
I have touched several things and found I just taste burnt and grumpy. 

But I was missing salt and oil
247 2018-07-30 23:27:19 Hmmm strange... I always get out and watch the oil change... check the dipstick... if your oil on the dipstick is light brown in color and is see thru, then it’s new oil... old oil is dark brown to black in color and isn’t very see thru or isn’t see thru.
248 2018-07-30 23:27:11 they put oil on the gravel in our neighborhood Hm *lays on it and gets cooked alive*
249 2018-07-30 23:27:05 my greatest joy right now is my palm kernel oil. Time to nourish my skin... Yum
250 2018-07-30 23:27:02 it's pretty easy but never done it myself and u need a good size container to recycle the oil after!
251 2018-07-30 23:26:44 & no it isn't. Our goods  have to move through their ports which they then count as trade. 
They even assigned oil away so it didn't need to pay Scotland its share of resources.
252 2018-07-30 23:26:33 If you dont have oil/grease on your hands, did you really work on your car ?

258 2018-07-30 23:24:18 #ableg #abed Good news. Means we can be good environmental stewards and out compete conflict oil from terror states. We should build Energy East, right.

264 2018-07-30 23:23:43 What are your thoughts on BC shipping US coal? Importing oil/gas from countries with horrible environmental and human rights records?
265 2018-07-30 23:23:42 I completely forgot that coconut oil fixes everything  definitely using that, thanks boo!

267 2018-07-30 23:23:22  it’s so good though. But don’t follow the directions. Just sauté with olive oil.
268 2018-07-30 23:23:15 Referring largely to US shale, "From 2010 until 2018, even in the face of extremely strong non-OPEC supply growth, global oil demand actually exceeded total non-OPEC liquids growth" Goehring. #mythvsfact
269 2018-07-30 23:23:14 I believe he's talking about companies fracking for oil and gas in Oklahoma and elsewhere. Causes lots of problems , like earth quakes for one.

273 2018-07-30 23:22:40 Same! On wash days, I’ll put a dot of Jamaican castor oil but only to the roots but anymore than that will weigh it down and have me looking like a wet dog 
274 2018-07-30 23:22:39 MCT oil ... will have you shitting like no other 
275 2018-07-30 23:22:38 Funny you should ask.. last month my car acted up.. turns out there was zero oil in it.. I watch my mileage like a hawk.. it wasn’t time to change it.. jerks did nothing last oil chAnge.. got lucky my engine didn’t blow...
276 2018-07-30 23:22:21 Nor do these tankers fitted with the same safety r'qmnts as designated by NEB or accompanying tugs and pilot vessels. And anti pipeline protesters would rather see this and oil by rail than the stringent conditions imposed on KM.
277 2018-07-30 23:22:11 What if I was a preacher!!!! Celebrating life with CBD oil for everyone!!!!! Soothing the soul one Vape at a time craftedextracts 
278 2018-07-30 23:21:59 There are still same jobs in steel and coal -they just moved to countries that created same jobs but w/much higher pollution rates.
There are many more new jobs in oil and gas due to USA ingenuity-  These are critical to national security and lessening power of ME & Russia.
279 2018-07-30 23:21:55 @FatKidDeals you have any essential oil diffusers?
280 2018-07-30 23:21:44 All over the twittersphere.  Equity experts on bonds, bond experts on oil, oil experts on gold.
281 2018-07-30 23:21:41 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! null
282 2018-07-30 23:21:30 Malaysia does not need a FLEGT for legality of Palm Oil. Land tenure, legal systems, forest protections, all in place. Modelled on the UK! Multiple regulators & overseers including @mpob_tweets, MPOA, MTC, FRIM, MNRE, and many more...(3/9)
283 2018-07-30 23:21:18 I do agree that for Canada to succeed in the 21st century, we need to be able to get our oil to market at or near Brent pricing. We need to grow up.

As for the Eastern refineries - They're geared towards 32ᵒ~ API Oil, whereas the Oil Sands can only provide heavier API oil.
284 2018-07-30 23:21:06 Now the oil starts separating from the water.
285 2018-07-30 23:20:55 My place uses Kafke oil. It only changes if it really wants to.
286 2018-07-30 23:20:47 I bet the oil is mud and filter is gone. Poor prioritization.
287 2018-07-30 23:20:41 yes im having a stupid little panic right now and yes im also burping up vegetable oil
288 2018-07-30 23:20:19 Koch r x Russians, like Tillerson Exxon man, all want oil 
289 2018-07-30 23:20:08 But fr “dirty sock” smell is burning engine oil and other airplane chemicals tbh these ppl need a damn hospital
290 2018-07-30 23:20:06 Today was spent playing golf,lunch, then a trip to the tailor to pick up new shirts. Newbury Tailoring in the Back Bay  and a oil change. Not to shabby for Monday
291 2018-07-30 23:20:02 Normal cars need an oil change around every 1-2 years. How often do you do it in a F1 car? #F1Inbox
292 2018-07-30 23:19:54 From a return standpoint, it's not much different than what the Reds got from the Yankees for Chapman, Giving up an asset that young has to suck for any organization but Blue Jays had no other options.

296 2018-07-30 23:19:03 My "home town" has a population of 4600 people.  I think I've been there 3 times, and one of those I was busy being born... That said, it is on the 3rd largest oil sands in Canada, so I probably could make some serious bank, but I think my wife would kill me living there.
297 2018-07-30 23:19:01 I know it's no consolation but it might have been the knock on from the BA plane that leaked hydraulic oil over runway, you can claim compensation under EU261/2014 (google it) the airline should give you details too
298 2018-07-30 23:18:59 Oil packed tuna is not for tuna sandwiches. It's great if you mix it with fresh lemon juice, garlic, parsley, and cannelini beans as a summer salad.
299 2018-07-30 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
300 2018-07-30 23:18:34 We can't have anyone seeing guns, mercy no!
301 2018-07-30 23:18:33 The situation in Malaysia w/ Palm Oil is not comparable to timber, and fundamentally misunderstands the Western standards that govern and regulate the Malaysian Palm Oil sector, which was accomplished w/ the help of the UK. (2/9)
302 2018-07-30 23:18:21 I love oil
303 2018-07-30 23:18:07 A T E N C I O N
La estación de servicio del A.C.A. NO tiene nafta.-
Sólo tiene gas oil.-
304 2018-07-30 23:18:02 Absolutely! Norway has an oil fund with trillions saved for a rainy day. 
Scotland has nothing. Not a single penny. Nada, zilch! 
Oil money was spent to refurbished the South East & paid for US puppet wars.
Scotland was given food banks & told to STFU. 
No more.
305 2018-07-30 23:18:01 .@RichardGrahamUK thank you for your reply. Before you arrive in Malaysia, a short briefing to correct your error on timber/palm oil. 1st, the situation in Indonesia which you mention was focused on legality of timber. Indonesia adopted a legality scheme called SVLK (1/9)
306 2018-07-30 23:17:48 We use MCT oil (1tbs), ghee (1tsp), cacao powder (1tsp), stevia/erythritol mix called Wholesome, and a little salt. I put a tiny bit of heavy cream in to cut the taste of the ghee.
307 2018-07-30 23:17:41 is it stupid to have mct oil powder if you’re not on keto?

313 2018-07-30 23:17:04 Will you be in pa this weekend
314 2018-07-30 23:17:03 i always use eucalyptus and peppermint oil like 2 drops of each in my diffuser and it always clears my sinuses and shit
315 2018-07-30 23:16:49 I need a good ass body massage with some oil & 
316 2018-07-30 23:16:46 Only way you ever gonna catch me falling for your bullshit again is if you put some baby oil on the steps.
317 2018-07-30 23:16:41 To be fair it’s actually filtering Cortez’s policies, a minor mercy on us all
318 2018-07-30 23:16:39 Think he said he showers MANY times a day. This could be the cause for his greasy hair and reactive skin. Shampooing excessively strips your hair of oil and causes your scalp to create more. Same with the skin. If you furiously soap yourself you’re likely to be oilier. Oh humans
319 2018-07-30 23:16:34 So when big oil releases studies saying their carbon emissions do not contribute to a warming climate & big tobacco releases studies saying cigs don't cause cancer you trust that?
320 2018-07-30 23:16:33 Ordered a fancy skincare product on eBay. Got delivered over the weekend. I just now sat down to use it and wouldn’t ya know IT IS LITERALLY VEGETABLE OIL WITH BLUE FOOD COLORING IN IT.  There’s a special place in hell for people who mess with a girl’s skincare y’all
321 2018-07-30 23:16:32 EIA models are "unconstrained" i.e., w/out mundane concerns like  reserves or economics. Think of this as a "potential" production  forecast.

Production is supposed to mean sales + oil in lease tank batteries. All lease stored crude is notable but nowhere near 100s kb/d.
322 2018-07-30 23:16:26 i cut up a bunch of peppers to put in my guac then i accidentally scratched the inside of my ear w the chili oil still on my hands and now i wanna pull a van gogh and cut my ear off (:
323 2018-07-30 23:16:20 Previous to the scientific drilling of the 90s and early 2000s.  Colleagues were able to trace back samples from oil exploratory boreholes recovered by PEMEX back in the 40s and 50s.  At the time they classified the impact rocks a volcanic breccia and andesite.

327 2018-07-30 23:15:52 Don't forget corporations like Big Oil, Big Pharma, telecomunication companies, GEO (private prisons, camps for refugees) and others.
328 2018-07-30 23:15:48 Anyone else feel like shit after you go get a oil change and they tell you everything wrong with your car?! 

Mechanic: ya, your tires look like shit and I’m going to need to tell you about about our 5 star package cause your car basically is shit.  

Me: oh, okay but no thanks
329 2018-07-30 23:15:42 Are they selling to the Saudi's too?
The Saudi's are taking water from the Colorado River putting it in oil type tankers and taking it back to SA. This should be stopped buy it from WASHINGTON STATE OR BC THEY HAVE PLENTY.
330 2018-07-30 23:15:33 As a general over view it seems the alliance between the far right and Russia has two links anti-gay legislation and anti-Muslim prejudice. Putin appears to sweeten their mutual agenda with oil and gas futures while he works to keep former Soviet countries out of the EU.
331 2018-07-30 23:15:25 You do know that execs at Kinder Morgan actually laughed when asked if that was a valid argument about people opposing the oil industry. Tells a lot about a poster when they believe something even the oil big wigs laugh at. #chump
332 2018-07-30 23:15:09 Hey take your head out of the JAR ding dong. Hes not a Russian puppet:bombing Syria 2x. Increasing oil drilling, sanctions & killing R Mercs
333 2018-07-30 23:14:58 @RealDonad_Trump oil prices are going up.  That should be your main concern. The economy will tank with high oil prices and you will be blamed.
334 2018-07-30 23:14:58 And now @RobProvince earned another follower.
335 2018-07-30 23:14:40 Make this next-level aspirational by frying it IN the CBD oil

337 2018-07-30 23:14:15 It's all an international sex/oil money/Hollywood cabal.
338 2018-07-30 23:14:11 As a person who's cleaned oily smoke residues off rental apartment ceilings, I'd suggest smokers, even weed smokers, go outside, if legal to do so.  Mind you, I'd rent to an indoor weed smoker sooner than to someone known to burn olive oil candles indoors.

341 2018-07-30 23:13:51 We had out whole house covered in asbestos shingles as fireproofing. We burned oil for heat in those times.

343 2018-07-30 23:12:52 Lol the UK government got 200 million from oil through Barnett  Scotland got 13,000 million and you want to give it back lol

Car had an oil change
I’m ready to drink coffee, eat pie, and watch @theacaciastrain on Sunday in fucking Canada  
345 2018-07-30 23:12:25 @jcmaningat most likely hates Duterte so much that anything negative will be connected to the president. From global matters like global crude oil prices & global inflation to local matters like nutriasia. I prefer more police presence especially at nights.
346 2018-07-30 23:12:23 Oil change in this thaaaang.
347 2018-07-30 23:12:22 I really don't care for that much oil on my wiener.
348 2018-07-30 23:12:17 Washed it and doing a coconut oil hair mask later buuuuutttt idk what’s best it probably don’t matter lol
349 2018-07-30 23:12:13 He’s burning the midnight oil rn bro
350 2018-07-30 23:11:42 In an Oil rich nation it is very surprising to hear these facts.... Maybe the fact that ALL the money has gone to Westminster would explain that. They say we get an 8% share... I doubt that very much after their charges for Trident, M25, Crossrail, HS1 + 2, Illegal Iraq war etc.
351 2018-07-30 23:11:42 linseed oil is great! Makes everything so colourful, and your ponies coat shine
352 2018-07-30 23:11:23 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the cellar with the lead pipe!
353 2018-07-30 23:11:06 I just read that it costs $21,000 to change oil in a Bugatti Veyron

355 2018-07-30 23:10:42 It's oil drums in red white and blue...the top of the pyramid missing. I see it a meaning "death to America"

357 2018-07-30 23:10:34 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

361 2018-07-30 23:09:54 i wash my face with water and take off make up with coconut oil and a soft flannel and sometimes use simple moisturiser and nearly always wear suncream and barely wear foundation these days
362 2018-07-30 23:09:33 Always stand and watch them completely drain your oil, They will stop in the middle of the oil being drained and just put the plug back up. they drain 3-4 qts and they save 1-2 qts per car, Wal Mart is very well known for that. TRUST ME.
363 2018-07-30 23:08:56 do oil have alcohol in it?

366 2018-07-30 23:08:03 Overheard from the car next to us at a traffic light: “I can take care of that myself. I can pay my own bills. I can put gas in my car. I can change my own oil. I can do all of that for myself. What I need from YOU is time, commitment, and DICK.”
367 2018-07-30 23:08:03 Be informed that the World Financial Crises of 2008 posed difficulty, arguably, only to western economies in form of higher commodity prices (crude oil). Nigeria basically got better-off with the crises since its oil was sold expensively. It wasn't all about Yaradua.
368 2018-07-30 23:07:49 oh and last ingredient is ~75g MCT oil, again probably just the C8 chain or also sometimes i use C8+C10. grams bc i'm using a scale so that's easy. convert to mL if you need to
369 2018-07-30 23:07:41 No, I stand there and watch. Years ago I had a brand new car and I took it in for its 1st oil change and I watched them close hood, & I said "do you think you should put THE OIL CAP BACK ON? They said whoops!!! That could have cost them a new engine!
370 2018-07-30 23:07:39 Plastic from oil. You would think they have something made from unicorn waste to use instead.
371 2018-07-30 23:07:31 most stags had rover v8 fitted because the stag v8 was terrible for losing oil pressure.
372 2018-07-30 23:07:19 How are using CBD oil to help you sleep? I’ve been using it for my sinuses, by sticking it up my hooter unsurprisingly ;)
373 2018-07-30 23:07:19 Brown rice, honey buffalo cauliflower and sautéed kale & asparagus (olive oil & roasted garlic) for dinner. 

Wow I’m a chef now. 
374 2018-07-30 23:06:51 Drill the oil, pollute the air... The sooner we poison outselves into extinction the sooner this planet will be free from our scurge and begin to heal itself.
375 2018-07-30 23:06:35 If you add extra virgin olive oil to the pan with your kale it makes it easier to scrape off into the garbage.

377 2018-07-30 23:06:15 I've a theory that kid getting hit by car in that dance video cause he 'slipped on oil' is fake AF.
378 2018-07-30 23:05:57 That doesn't answer the question I asked does it?
Who controls the corporation tax rates & breaks for the oil companies?

You'll find that the UK Gov collects MUCH LESS tax from the oil industry than our Norwegian counterparts despite slightly higher production in the UK fields
379 2018-07-30 23:05:56 You mean social security, subsidies for farmers and oil companies. News flash in few years robot's and A.I will be doing 70%of all labor/physical work and since your kind are anti immigrants what do you suppose happens.

393 2018-07-30 23:04:03 How about an oil tweet.   OPEC is still playing games.
394 2018-07-30 23:03:55 bowser destroyed/consumed a bottle of almond oil yesterday and I feel so bad for him (now that I know he won't die) but also, serves you right motherfucker. stop doing fuck shit.
395 2018-07-30 23:03:52 Engine is probably fine. Would have to look for oil leaks where the cases are joined around the engine. Tank is probably the most expensive fix. My sv650 was 700 for a second hand tank and there are way more of those. I never replaced it lol.

the irvings back east source MOST if not ALL their oil from saudi arabia....

can we consider that in canada's best interests? 

i think not sir.....
403 2018-07-30 23:02:06 Not a bad day today. Met some interesting people, from an Italian family who insisted I come in for a Coffee and a very tasty almond tart. Not good for my diet though! And the poet in oil sheik robes! Who told me her entire life story! I liked her.
404 2018-07-30 23:01:57 Thank you. That’s the oil from my hair lmao
405 2018-07-30 23:01:45 Food for thought.

Buhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with us as a country?

412 2018-07-30 23:01:06 Wages stagnant and going lower, oil prices higher, inflation growing

429 2018-07-30 22:59:51 Why does my skin feel like full on oil slick these days?? And my random asf cramps?? For someone not getting her period for another 2 weeks, it sure as shit doesn’t feel like it.

431 2018-07-30 22:59:45 Stacked oil drums classy
432 2018-07-30 22:59:35 I made curry but added too much water at first so i compensated with more powder and oil but now it’s almost too savory to bear wehhhh
433 2018-07-30 22:59:33 *without any soothing aloe oil afterwards and an extra itchy grow back.
434 2018-07-30 22:59:28 Peppermint oil and an entire gallon of water!!
435 2018-07-30 22:59:20 owning a car is all fun until you have to worry about oil changes, replacing old tires, and gas prices going up :/
436 2018-07-30 22:59:10 midday i'll probably make a butter/mct oil/coffee thing (about 1500kcal's worth; i do, a half-bar of kerrygold unsalted; the equivalent mass in mct oil [actually, it's the C8 chain isolated bc it's the best one, but]; and 6* cups of coffee)
437 2018-07-30 22:58:58 i will pay someone in real money and also food to bring me a fucking filter wrench because CURRENT GINA thought PAST GINA bought one, and PAST GINA assumed CURRENT GINA WOULD JUST PICK ONE UP NEXT TIME NBD and my car is up on jacks and has no oil in it and anyway help

439 2018-07-30 22:58:30 The same is also true with a lot of other healthcare services.  There’s a good case here to encourage people to o pay for basic care and drugs out of pocket or with an HSA, leaving insurance options to just catastrophic.  We don’t use car insurance for oil changes.
440 2018-07-30 22:58:09 Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor. A wise man’s heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish man’s heart directs him toward the left.

443 2018-07-30 22:57:30 Coconut oil, olive oil, cocoa butter, shea butter. If you can't eat it, do not use it on your body. Simple. Why do we have to "do something with" our hair in the 1st place?

448 2018-07-30 22:56:44 Pour les anglophones, en livre d’introduction au sujet et sous forme de Roman, il y a "Prélude" de Kurt Kobb très court et très pédagogique.
Idéal pour les petit lecteurs.
449 2018-07-30 22:56:34  Apparently she asked her friend for her beauty tip to lighten up for the wedding as she don black from going to balogun too much. Only for that one to say baby oil, she followed the advice and turned darker with pimples. 
Now some people are calling her petty.
450 2018-07-30 22:56:17 There was cinnamon oil on the counter and I touched it now my fucking hands smell like cinnamon I hate it
451 2018-07-30 22:56:04 You're welcome. I understand. I've done the pharmaceuticals & while they have their place, they're not the end all be all. I hear CBD oil is good for anxiety too. You WILL get through this. 
452 2018-07-30 22:55:55 If you don’t like socialism tell the farmers to give back the 12 billion bailout. Or oil companies to give back their subsidies
453 2018-07-30 22:55:26 Not saying I like socialism but if she was going to use a good example they would use Libya &Muammar Gaddafi but he socialized all the oil and he was really making progress until Hillary Clinton happened.
454 2018-07-30 22:55:24 olive oil is good too.  but i rather eat it (with chopped garlic) than wear it  :-)

461 2018-07-30 22:53:56 My friend uses CBD Oil for her husband and her dog and swears by it! Her  husband had a grand mal seizure and hasn't had one since. They use and sell it through Hempworx
462 2018-07-30 22:53:51 The dilemma! Economics vs Nat gas for home heating are terrible- efficiency or renewables. Not easy being green if the polluter doesn’t pay. Vs oil, it’s better.
463 2018-07-30 22:53:45 need to get my oil changed
464 2018-07-30 22:53:42 Nobody pulls off the slick back with motor oil hair like David Carr. NOBODY!
465 2018-07-30 22:53:26 It’s also a possibility that Cannabis was an ingredient in the holy anointing oil used in the Temple in Jerusalem.
466 2018-07-30 22:53:19 this will really help the working class in the same manner that exporting oil & gas will keep us energy independent
467 2018-07-30 22:52:45 Okay I put the lavender oil in the diffuser and it’s stronger than the orange oil. I thought maybe it was broken but the orange oil is just not strong.

471 2018-07-30 22:51:59 Oh man, still burning oil?
472 2018-07-30 22:51:45 Though it'd be a good idea to wear tanning oil while floating the river and I'm burnt..

474 2018-07-30 22:51:36 Another ethics violation. Using your office to peddle snake oil.

477 2018-07-30 22:51:30 welp, time for oil burns
478 2018-07-30 22:51:19 Ask @JustinTrudeau to ban middle eastern oil coming up the st.lawrence to supply Quebec and fund terrorism. Get the oil from @Alberta become energy independent.
479 2018-07-30 22:51:19 Y'a évidemment de ça c'est vrai, et la psyché humaine qui ne peut pas tout absorber et interpréter les choses, et en régurgiter une analyse complexe car c'est en réalité hors capacité humaine. Alors oui, on imagine des situations où il y a trop de raccourcis et de biais.
480 2018-07-30 22:51:17 Maybe now @JerryBrownGov will finally get serious about ending oil and gas extraction in California? Real #ClimateAction NOW!  #StopFracking
481 2018-07-30 22:51:08 This is just hand-waving. Standard Oil had clearly delineated units that had stand-alone viability. Amazon does not.
482 2018-07-30 22:51:02 You know it’s a successful Monday when you spray yourself in the face w/ olive oil trying to cook dinner.

おめでとうございます
489 2018-07-30 22:49:15 It's true! And clean up is a snap! Just throw in some veggie oil while it's hot and everything magically comes off!

Completely true. 100%.
490 2018-07-30 22:49:13  someone even removed her friend from her bridal train because that one asked her to use baby oil that she would get lighter.  Unfortunately aunty was getting darker few days to the wedding.
491 2018-07-30 22:49:11 Pull the dipstick. If you can see the stick and not black oil, you're likely fine. Put a mark on your filter with a sharpie.
492 2018-07-30 22:49:10 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…

499 2018-07-30 22:47:49 So Google tells you Scotland gives oil companies tax breaks????

501 2018-07-30 22:47:30 Because that's the colour of oil

504 2018-07-30 22:46:55 if y’all could hear Morgan knocked right now after her coconut oil rub down... she is real life in here snoring lmao on her back spread eagle I’m in tears
505 2018-07-30 22:46:45 Caught them not changing it. Needless to say some cash in my wallet and new oil later I never went back.
506 2018-07-30 22:46:43 This is actually a mechanical issue. Oil from the engines or APU gets into the air conditioning system and makes a dirty sock smell. Very dangerous since you are virtually breathing vaporized oil. Good job to the Crew for declaring an emergency and landing.
507 2018-07-30 22:46:41 C'est l'abus de films catastrophe hollywoodiens, nous sommes tellement habitué aux effondrement type Tsunami/Astéroïde qu'on envisage pas la réalité c'est à dire une logue periodique de déclin et de pourrissement du système, et avec des faux rebonds parsemés long de la pente.

513 2018-07-30 22:46:00 I accidentally left my lavender oil diffuser on and just woke up from a FOUR hour nap.
514 2018-07-30 22:45:59 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
515 2018-07-30 22:45:58 Why agile you ask? Blasphemy! Wasn't it the next big thing pushed by snake oil consultants? And we believed it. They have moved on (to analytics, AI, whatever) and we are left to make it work. Realise (upfront) it's all a game - you don't have to play.
516 2018-07-30 22:45:44 Heads up to @RepMattGaetz Twitter’s “Jack” is selling Snake Oil today... pretending there is an effort a foot to correct the problems @Twitter Not Buying it Jack!

527 2018-07-30 22:44:27 You got kids right? Trump is destroying the planet with his oil and gas drilling plans in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and including previously protected (Marine) areas of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans.
528 2018-07-30 22:44:16 Poverty looms! 

NNPC records N240b loss in 13-month Petrol supplies... Indicates Nigerians consumed 80.26 million liters in March.... Country lost over 7m barrels of oil in February 2018 to multiple shut-ins.
529 2018-07-30 22:44:14 When you use Venezuela as your argument you immediately discredit yourself.  Venezuela's problems stem from their dependence on oil - Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, Belgium

Half a plate w/ veggies & healthy carbs & the rest of the plate of veggies. Cook w/ olive oil. 100% whole wheat pasta, bread, buns. WATER! Only white cheese. 1% milk.-

544 2018-07-30 22:42:35 I would fry the pork belly, tofu, and shallots in the chili oil, deglaze the pan with the coconut milk, and put that over the egg noodles, not sure if bamboo shoots fill the same role as bean sprouts, but if they do that could be a nice addition
545 2018-07-30 22:42:31 I can leave a pub sub in the refrigerator overnight with mayo oil and vinegar and still eat or the next day no problem
546 2018-07-30 22:42:22 Money is not a resource like oil or gold, or timber or water.  There are no money rainforests to cut down, or money veins to mine, or money pools to tap.  It CAN be printed when more is needed to pay for things you want and can be taxed away if too much is in circulation.
547 2018-07-30 22:42:21 She’s been reminding me of Olive oil.

551 2018-07-30 22:42:05 I think we had this chat on our L.A. adventure. Too much money coming into political coffers from Big Oil. They're not going to undercut their benefactors.
552 2018-07-30 22:42:04 Nope, because I check my oil after I leave to make sure it's clean and full. It always is!

570 2018-07-30 22:40:04 the fact that it took me all day to find a place that would change my oil bc I have a 2018 car. 
571 2018-07-30 22:40:02 CBD oil Is made from the hemp plant. It is not illegal and it helps with many ailments. #Depression #Anxiety #FacialWrinkles #Seizures #NauseaAndVomiting Visit my website and find out more even make a purchase while you’re there. It also has benefits for pets as well. #Arthritis
572 2018-07-30 22:39:30 You sure that's enough oil?
573 2018-07-30 22:39:29 Only 90k? Can tell this oil money is getting to you lot, 90k is a lot to real fans like us Scousers
574 2018-07-30 22:39:20 Really? Not at all? Maybe there’s info you can get in the quest. There should be an oil of some kind that you can buy and make
575 2018-07-30 22:39:02 If anyone wants to wash,clean and get an oil change on my car that would be GREAAAATT
576 2018-07-30 22:39:01 Mukhang masebo nga tingnan daming oil n nakaimbak s mukha .Ang yabang pa ehh sya mismo ang numero unong reflection ng lodi nia lol.Mga basher ni mm nuknukan ng pgkaswangetLord patawad po.
577 2018-07-30 22:38:54 I wanna put oil on my body have a really nice two piece an just take some bomb photos lmfao
578 2018-07-30 22:38:41 Not sure this is true. Are they not counting the emissions that come from the use of the products of major oil companies? This is not to imply that diet isn't important, I just worry that the numbers lack context and convey an incorrect impression.
579 2018-07-30 22:38:26 Live fast, die young, leave a coconut oil smelling corpse.
580 2018-07-30 22:38:21 I covered the topic for a number of years but I never agreed with the predictions of collapse that some peak oil writers came up with. If a journalist covers the topic of fascism, for example, does that make them a fascist ?
581 2018-07-30 22:38:10 how odd that the Koch "big oil" Brothers are now a favorite in leftie circles 
582 2018-07-30 22:38:03 I used to worry about that. Now our best friends own a Kia dealership in Covina called Covina Valley Kia. They change the oil and do checkup of fluids ect on our Kias.
583 2018-07-30 22:38:02 Am I the only person that doesn’t break out from coconut oil on my skin? I have acne prone skin too.. idk it’s weird. I hear coconut oil horror stories and coconut oil miracles and I know everyone’s skin is different but idk what or who to believe 
584 2018-07-30 22:37:53 一応スケジュールには入れておきます！ます！！
585 2018-07-30 22:37:45 America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. How exactly does a gas tax benefit Putin?
586 2018-07-30 22:37:28 Cod liver oil no doubt...It was the snake oil of the day around that time no?...
587 2018-07-30 22:36:55 Yea.... That's the problem. The start time.
588 2018-07-30 22:36:52 2/ je me dit "on y est" le fameux déclencheur que j'attendais depuis si longtemps. Manque de bol j'avais pas compris à l'époque que c'était juste le début d'un processus sur un temps plus long, et que la dégradation pourrait prendre 30 ans encore. :(
589 2018-07-30 22:36:40 I think you got a sample of some velvet men’s body oil too.
590 2018-07-30 22:36:36 People said the same about Standard Oil, I would guess.
591 2018-07-30 22:36:13 Big business has always controlled  government but usually through lobbying & donations. Now they’ve taken the reigns completely & now serve only the interests of big oil, big pharma + big agriculture.. bye bye NHS via brexit & $$ for US companies, BB environ law for oil.. etc 2/
592 2018-07-30 22:36:03 You are posting on the subject of peak oil in 2008.  One would presume that you are in agreement with those conclusions.
593 2018-07-30 22:35:56 Idek if it's just my family that's like this or its all Palestinians but we used olives and olive oil to heal any and every ailment for basically anything from constipation to cancer
594 2018-07-30 22:35:46 Oil and water!
595 2018-07-30 22:35:45 Ginger root, lemon, turmeric, honey, & a little coconut water & one drop of oregano oil.
596 2018-07-30 22:35:43  he’s gone off the deep end of lunacy!
And still hasn’t figured out neutrality.
Those fanatics are dangerous johnny!
Good thing ireland doesn’t have oil or you’d be facing “liberation”!
597 2018-07-30 22:35:04 1/ Pour être franc, j'ai toujours eu en tête depuis gamin que ce truc, ditto le Système, ne pourrait pas tenir. Je n'étais pas écolo mais je voyais bien le bordel en approche et la déconstruction en cours des sociétés, ça me terrifiait. La chute de Lehman Brother en 2008...
598 2018-07-30 22:34:59 Since when were loans informative? Debts need to be repaid. Oil flowing ... 4tankers in 15 days : not presently a company making revenue.

600 2018-07-30 22:34:53 Canada is responsible for just under 2% of GHGases in the world and the Alberta Oil sands contributes only 10% of Canadas emmissions. So the Oil Sands are responsible for 0.2 % of the Worlds GHG !!!! Come on people get the facts straight before whining about them!!!

603 2018-07-30 22:33:54 Try it sauteed in olive oil and garlic. It's really yummy.
604 2018-07-30 22:33:53 @realDonaldTrump .Libya, which has been wracked by violence for years.... Look, tn army of their own, etc... What they mostly have is the 1Oth most important 'oil reserve' in the world... Now, Italy and France are 'competing' to 'RULE' over Lybia... and USA, as 'mercenaries', >

606 2018-07-30 22:33:37 Like Oil ever gonna stay down....come on now.
607 2018-07-30 22:33:32 Yeah tweeted about "Low Tax Chloe" on #bbcaq. Another ghastly snake oil salesperson making money by shilling for libertarian anarchists. As for Mark Littlewood, his claim to fame is supporting the abolishment of the Minimum Wage. #Newsnight
608 2018-07-30 22:33:30 @PoliticalIslam of the Earth, Babylon the GREAT Islam is Paganism Mecca is its center Saudi Arabia is filled with pitch or oil  She burns forever and is never inhabited again  Rivers of pitch or oil
609 2018-07-30 22:33:16 If it helps, my first passport photo looked liked it was taken on a fish eye lens and the white background made me look so pale that my eyes looked like I hadn’t slept in 20 years bc they were so purple and now on my new one, I’m kind of orange and my skin is shining with oil
610 2018-07-30 22:32:58 Why doesn’t @CARICOMorg cooperate with Venezuelan people? You sold your dignity, and in exchange for cheap oil you support Maduro’s dictatorial regime which starves women and children. SHAME ON YOU!!! Desperate immigrants will be the next disaster you need to prepare for.
611 2018-07-30 22:32:56 Cannabis infused massage oil mixed with #biofreeze on the forearms to help with this tendonitis/carpol tunnel flare up. Aaaand phone is going out of my hands for a couple of hours
612 2018-07-30 22:32:44 "Our willingness"? Speak for yourself—and while you are at it, try raising the corporate tax rate and killing off oil and gas subsidies.
613 2018-07-30 22:32:42 On the bright side, libeling Tom Hanks is helping the scammers to sell more hemp oil
614 2018-07-30 22:32:42 Gargle oil of oregano
615 2018-07-30 22:32:41 We dont miss the oil stains
616 2018-07-30 22:32:25 They’re alright. My mum also makes them a different way where they’re fried whole with a filling and that’s penggg (but quite unhealthy bc of all the oil)
617 2018-07-30 22:32:11 Loving the oil revenue is bad concept 
618 2018-07-30 22:32:09 Superb fish. What’s on them? Seasoning, lemon and oil only?
619 2018-07-30 22:32:07 هههههه خلاص بقا 
620 2018-07-30 22:31:39 Of oil sand fields, in contrast to the greenery you have cherry picked above
621 2018-07-30 22:31:24 $70 for an oil change, oh ok.
622 2018-07-30 22:30:56 Só vejo artes feias com oil pastel mas comprei mesmo assim pois artista que faz arte
623 2018-07-30 22:30:54 Can you think of an oil stock that would pay dividends while you just did a ‘set it and forget’ method? I was thinking $XOM but didn’t seem clf bound enough
624 2018-07-30 22:30:30 Wow just realized i got a D on my 7th grade final essay because i wrote that the iraq war was because of oil because thats genuinely what i thought the lesson we were taught was......accidentally socially aware
625 2018-07-30 22:30:29 Yes Gavin should worry! Any twosome newsome who act's green, but he & his wife owned part of the oil rig #deepwater that gushed oil back in 2010. Gavin's not so green now either, with plastic syringes & feces on every street in SF. #VoteRed2018

628 2018-07-30 22:30:20 SO my bf & i were just getting his oil changed & the girl working on his car was high key flirting w him & i didnt really care until... yall she goes “if the engine starts acting like it’s bout to blow, throw her out the car first” & LOOKED ME DEAD IN THE EYE. SO SHOOK & SCARED.
629 2018-07-30 22:30:19 And they charge more for on oil change then some dealerships do. I got mine changed at Toyota in Clanton for 18 dollars cheaper
630 2018-07-30 22:30:13 Those "500,000 to a million bpd should be off the market" idiots look stupid alright.
631 2018-07-30 22:29:52 I used to mark the oil filter,  I would be charged for the oil and filter, but the filter was not changed.
632 2018-07-30 22:29:44 I think its the tea tree oil, i use a face cleanser from Trader Joe’s and it stings a little but i giess it is normal.
633 2018-07-30 22:29:28 Made patties with taro root yesterday. I added chopped onion, cumin and chillies to the mix, dipped the patties in flour and grilled them in a pan with olive oil. De-lish!
634 2018-07-30 22:29:26 Is an oil change really free if I wait 2 hours?
635 2018-07-30 22:29:12 U look like olive oil

637 2018-07-30 22:28:57 You do realize libya is meant to be like playing a game in Easy+ right!

Lack of population + big space + strategic location + free oil money + free natural gas money.

Y’all are just real shit at this game
638 2018-07-30 22:28:39 Pour moi "La grande révélation" remonte à 2009, je ne sais plus comment mais d'un coup de dévore tout ce qui traite de #PeakOil/Collapsologie  @JMJancovici @BenoitThevard, @OIL_MEN , @ASPOUSA , @richardheinberg, @gailtheactuary ou encore Orlov, Kunstler et Bardi et bien d'autres.

641 2018-07-30 22:27:56 My mom still uses pink oil moisturizer. Has been for over 20 yrs. She says she feels like the formula has changed
642 2018-07-30 22:27:49 Oil of Every Pearls Un-Insides good
643 2018-07-30 22:27:49 We keep finding more proof that "fossil fuels" are not what we think them to be. We find oil 6 miles down that's billions of years older than plant or animal. De-programmed scientists have postulated our tectonic plates lubricate themselves with oil and natural gas. #qanon
644 2018-07-30 22:27:41 I put truffle oil on flatbread pizza that I make. Some family members love it. Not me.
645 2018-07-30 22:27:22 #OOTT #CL_F #WTI am sure they do:).. but  it is so funny that  all the so called Iran experts/hawks were predicting a war and this clown is begging for a meeting.. The Iran con is a joke now.
646 2018-07-30 22:27:20 No oil rigs in background noted.  It stays that way RIGHT
647 2018-07-30 22:27:16 7. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 and yet Congress chose to mass murder people in Iraq without a Declaration of War. USA nationalized industries World War 1, World War 2.  USA terrorized friend Iran for decades because of oil.
648 2018-07-30 22:27:14 not so. not with every other country also not dealing with iran. iran has oil to sell but no one to sell it to. what is your theory as to how they will overcome such an issue, exactly? its completely impossible to survive sanctions placed by all countries w/o collapse.
649 2018-07-30 22:26:55 They sure will complain a whole lot more than the generation that had to deal with the Cold War, Falklands War, OPEC oil crisis, recession in 56, 73-75, 80-81, 90-91, Black Wednesday, double-digit inflation, constant airline terrorism, the Troubles, etc...
650 2018-07-30 22:26:51 oil and horses was the last memories. don`t ask
651 2018-07-30 22:26:06 Peppermint essential oil for sinus issues and I've heard Basil EO is good for allergies in general.  I use oils for a lot of stuff.  Good luck!
652 2018-07-30 22:26:02 I do this except no coconut oil I use 10-13 other oils
653 2018-07-30 22:25:50 Didn't know what to say. Twas only trying to look at em. Hader hair coloring along, plus a hot oil treatment kit.
654 2018-07-30 22:25:29 No oil changes on the Tesla either.  That's $50.+ every 2500-3000 miles.
655 2018-07-30 22:25:22 This beard oil

Surprised you’re not already electric, Stu!
659 2018-07-30 22:24:38 I wonder that all the time...but I check the oil to make sure it is clean.
660 2018-07-30 22:24:25 The coconut oil of tech solutions.
661 2018-07-30 22:24:18 You should focus on your own country and situation there. The audacity you have to focus on other country oil industry while yours is being destroyed. The border issue going to ICJ whether Venezuela like it or not.
662 2018-07-30 22:24:14 Jack is quite the Snake Oil salesman.
663 2018-07-30 22:23:52 Two figures lean on the railing and stare out at the harbour.

The water, oil black with tints of dim light, sways, reluctant and restless. The bridge beyond flashes uneven Morse code in yellow and red.

They could be lovers, friends, family. But they’re not. They’re enemies.
664 2018-07-30 22:23:52 I’m totally down. It’s easier. I’m 5x5 lifting too. It will work. It is working but in ounces, not pounds. The only remains question is can you eat unlimited fat calories from cheese, steak, bacon, olive oil, or is some sense still required?
665 2018-07-30 22:23:47  الحلو ف الرحله اني بخرج لوحدي وخرباااهاا

667 2018-07-30 22:23:33 You ever go to an oil change place and when they are done really wonder if they changed your oil at all??

670 2018-07-30 22:22:40 Tincture is oral and oil is often used as a lotion.
671 2018-07-30 22:22:37 No, I meant the Brothers Grimm. The Warlocks of Wichita. Things don't go better with Koch. The gas and oil brothers. In 20 years I'm hoping things change other than the earth that they're polluting.
Thus, the dead people I see are the aforementioned ones that Joe mentioned.
Tada!

690 2018-07-30 22:18:45 The suburbs (donut counties) of Indy are paying for the Colts with an increase in sales tax at local restaurants.  This was done when Lucas Oil was financed by the state. So we are not leaching as you claim!

699 2018-07-30 22:17:24 So I just learned about a really fucked up quest in World of Warcraft. Where the Alliance and Horde find out "Centaur Natives" have oil on their land, both want the oil.
700 2018-07-30 22:17:23 It depends on the oil. Each oil is different.
701 2018-07-30 22:17:17 How did this baby oil gel spill everywhere like this when it’s CLOSED?! Now I gotta wash my bed set and shit

710 2018-07-30 22:16:04 Don't you mean black? 
Last time I checked, our "green" is based in oil and death. 

But you're right ofc.
711 2018-07-30 22:16:01 I’ve seriously gotten a new vehicle every year for the past three years.. and I legit just went in for an oil change
712 2018-07-30 22:15:59 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
713 2018-07-30 22:15:41 Posting this figures with posting corresponding value of oil imports within the same period as well as exact government's Revenue from these figures is in my opinion an attempt to hoodwink the multitude of gullibles in our social media space.
714 2018-07-30 22:15:36 Oil
715 2018-07-30 22:15:13 The fires in California just out right it's the ethanol and we've got to stop using the ethanol and they're dumping dead bodies in the oil wells
716 2018-07-30 22:15:12 Went to Boos in Effingham today to buy board cream and oil and I ended up buying a new board. Their new store is awesome.
717 2018-07-30 22:15:07 In different units, like the US did it with Standard Oil.
718 2018-07-30 22:15:04 I hope that everybody knows what is going on with the Iran . He want these things change other than the fact that Obama put them in is because Iran is an ally with Russia and Iran and Iraq are also allies now. Think about the math behind the crude oil and gas.
719 2018-07-30 22:14:55 Let me pray, burning the mid night oil , let it be a sweet aroma to my creator.
720 2018-07-30 22:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
721 2018-07-30 22:14:32 So are wars and protecting big OIL in the middle east but we some how still pay for it.

724 2018-07-30 22:13:05 Is there any serious threat than closing red see sea lanes by pro Iran Houthis who receives instruction from Iran who threatened in many occasions to close Red Sea & Arabian Gulf see lanes if not allowed to export oil? Why not take attack of Saudi oil tankers seriously?
725 2018-07-30 22:13:04 so i'm taking all these supplements now because of this narcolepsy bullshit BUT

i've only just discovered the wonder that is coconut oil and i am, as the youths say, Shook
726 2018-07-30 22:13:03 tore open the skin on my thumb trying to open an old oil paint tube.... how must we suffer for our art???
727 2018-07-30 22:13:00 oil blotting sheets ain’t cutting it. my greasy ass needs an oil blotting sheet mask 
728 2018-07-30 22:12:42 I'd love to see you in a crazy color, like the oil slick pastel hair thing that went around or a fiery red like Paige from Charmed.
729 2018-07-30 22:12:35 My dad sent me to the car dealership so he could get the oil changed in his car for free and I’ve been waiting for 3 hours. The guy just came in and I thought it was done, but he asked me if I was hanging in there. Like no, chad. I’m not hanging in there. Let me leave.

731 2018-07-30 22:12:33 Omg!  I will not even walk off trails anymore.  Treat your clothing like Dave says.  Do tick checks.  Put clothing in dryer for 10 minutes after being outside.  Take a shower after.  Check pets. I make lotion with lemon and eucalyptus oil for my body and use spray. 
732 2018-07-30 22:12:31 みーちゃんの独特な作品雰囲気羨ましい〜

写実性にも個性にも欠ける自分の作品の中途半端さがやだ〜
733 2018-07-30 22:12:28 It’s over €80 dollars a barrel. Production costs have halved. That means they are making the same profit they were when it was €100. Guy high up in the oil & gas industry said he was very confident & that price fall has made it leaner & got wages/costs realistic. Next!
734 2018-07-30 22:12:23 Ahh the old “lesser of two evils”.  I’m no expert but I believe oil sands production is a net-consumer of energy. Also I believe this pic is misleading. Not picking sides but, while the mining is destructive, battery tech itself is necessary for real renewables to be successful.
735 2018-07-30 22:12:22 For instance, I would have preferred that a translator had asked me if they could say "oil shaft." (Although it would have been even better if they had done basic research appropriate to the context.) But because they didn’t, what should have taken me roughly an hour to edit...
736 2018-07-30 22:12:20 Put coconut oil on myself and messed around and fell alseep outside and now I’m a new beautiful darker shade of black, looking scrumpalicious
737 2018-07-30 22:11:48 CBD oil can help with anxiety but it can also worsen it! Just to keep in mind
738 2018-07-30 22:11:47 Tuna in oil once the oil is drained mixes better with mayo. Tuna in water makes the tuna waterlogged. (I'm with you on thinking that Miracle Whip is an abomination, though.)
739 2018-07-30 22:11:31 Oil to the East of Me, Straws to the West of Me, so where's Big Al when you need Him?

742 2018-07-30 22:11:18 Trump says we will see growth by 2020 - just in time for re-election bid. He's a snake oil salesmen.... And a snake
743 2018-07-30 22:11:08 Mayonnaise is just egg yolks and oil, and ice cream already usually has egg yolks in it, so how would that even be different than cooking-oil-flavored ice cream?
744 2018-07-30 22:10:51 Lol yeah the infamous mumu comment. He was so rested in the confidence that oil money was going to make us a superpower. Today he's going about organising prayer/peace conferences after he don shit for church.
745 2018-07-30 22:10:44 It’s pretty fucking rude that the guys servicing my car are loudly making fun of how dirty it is. I didn’t ask you to clean my car, I asked you to change my oil. That’s it.
746 2018-07-30 22:10:40 Shit will hit the fan when all those stars dont get on the field they arent Bama where players will wait 2 years to play IMO Kirby is selling the snake oil and it will catch up to him.
747 2018-07-30 22:10:05 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
748 2018-07-30 22:09:50 I wouldn't know since I'm in an environment that is nothing but dirt, oil, & car wrecks.
749 2018-07-30 22:09:48 Definitely tan naked. I'll volunteer to cum and apply the oil 
750 2018-07-30 22:09:45 So absolutely drop dead gorgeous. Maybe I'll oil paint this beauty??
751 2018-07-30 22:09:44 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
752 2018-07-30 22:09:44 Here I thought we'd have to wait for the oil money to run out
753 2018-07-30 22:09:38 Marvi oil is not given away, the price is set by commodity markets and organizations such as OPEC. Vote @MickRich4Senate and @Pearce4NM men who understand business and how to produce real jobs.
754 2018-07-30 22:09:33 I imagine it this way:

Most of Europe in 1800s: We need to get rid of Jews.
Herzl: We want our own land.
[England: checks colonies; needs Suez Canal access MiddleEast oil] 
England: Sure. Let's scratch that Balfour Declaration. Deal?
Israël (1948) DONE 
Palestine: Fuuuuuuck!
755 2018-07-30 22:09:30 Coconut oil is good too
756 2018-07-30 22:09:13 Coconut oil cont.  x
 
You can replace any skincare product with coconut oil! 

Make sure you use 100% pure, raw, cold pressed coconut oil so that it actually works

Bring soon network shops of Tesla to Brazil and finish with hegemony of the Empire oil that is installed here for decades. I will be one of the first to buy a Model S or a Model X.

760 2018-07-30 22:08:54 Hansberry used to crack lmao.  They don’t know nothing about the baby oil epidemic.  @Tclark__
761 2018-07-30 22:08:52 If it's packed in olive oil, as they all should be, then there's no discussion here whatsoever
762 2018-07-30 22:08:45 Markets don't move in straight lines...some genius posted me they been long oil since 2002...it was $100 then...not a cash cow trade imho
763 2018-07-30 22:08:34 Mr. Trump is imposing even stricter sanctions on Russia than the previous president
also, he's not recognizing Russia's bid on the Ukraine, he's trying to get Europe to buy our oil over the Russian oil 
He's been very tough with Russia, but you only see one side b/c you watch MSM

Mom: "that's not an essential oil, A HOLE."
767 2018-07-30 22:07:29 Please give sources about the "inevitability" of the EU collapsing. Please also research the horrendous consequences of a no deal brexit (ie no flights, food prices drastically rising, high chances of riots, fuel and oil shortages etc.)

770 2018-07-30 22:06:56 Just wanted to share something with y’all. 
If your Car is making a ticking noise. You need to put some oil in it. 
I feel better now 
Carry own

772 2018-07-30 22:06:47 Everyone welcomes and We will obviously keep the oil
773 2018-07-30 22:06:46 Coconut oil  x
It’s good to use as:
• MOISTURER, after your skincare routine use this instead of moisturiser

• CLEANSER, soak some into a cotton pad and take your makeup off, replace other cleansers with this

• BODY OIL, instead of using the oils with chemicals added
774 2018-07-30 22:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
775 2018-07-30 22:06:16 I agree with you about everything tuna-related. Maybe mix in a little pickle relish. Oil-packed tuna is gross. Any meat packed in vegetable oil is gross. Even pet food. (I'm looking at you @FancyFeast after you ruined Appetizers with sunflower seed oil my cats won't eat it now)
776 2018-07-30 22:06:12 Education is low on list for spending in Republican states. They like it that way. Keep the masses stupid and Fox lies spewed at them 24-7. Give money to big oil and corporations to line the pockets of the rich. Low pay, no benefits and no way out for the residents. Repeat. Sad
777 2018-07-30 22:06:03 I love the it cosmetics cc cream and they just came out with an oil free matte version! It has SPF and has medium coverage too!
778 2018-07-30 22:06:02 So what the fuck do you prefer, gassholes? Status quo until Earth runs out of oil, permafrost, and time?
779 2018-07-30 22:05:58 I don't have good access to cbd up where I live but when I can get it from my friend who's using it to treat her lupus. I take Gabapentin 3x a day as a kinda catch all- helps w anxiety mood stabilization and nerve pain. I interchange the meds and the oil
780 2018-07-30 22:05:52 I hear you, I can’t express how amazing that is you did that. I only wish 4 more people like you

I work in a super rich oil money biz and the people there would NEVER do that for anyone yet they’ll stop at the casino and lose 1000-10000 dollars and act like it’s just a flutter

784 2018-07-30 22:05:21 Parsnips taste like nothing. Roast em with some salt and pepper and olive oil
785 2018-07-30 22:05:08 Gov must suspend import duties on fuel, negotiate with shipping companies to reduce price they charge us to bring in oil for a guaranteed business to ship SA minerals to wherever. 

SA doesn’t discriminate with who regards to who they give business to ship out our minerals.


786 2018-07-30 22:04:55 Shocking...been relying on those fish oil pills for years tbh
787 2018-07-30 22:04:42 Under Communism, the State owns the businesses.  In Cuba, it's illegal to own a fishing boat, but there are lots of them.  They're all State-owned.  Venezuela took over the oil companies.
788 2018-07-30 22:04:06 in august the sactions go into effect & will be followed to the letter. past few months, trump has given a warning to any country sourcing oil from iran to find it elsewhere, and their decline in oil export is a materialization of the transition other countries are making.
789 2018-07-30 22:04:01 In addition to that, while oil is big for Norway, it is far from all it has. It's the second largest exporter of fish in the world, behind China, and shipping is a massive industry there as well. Additionally, roughly 2/3 of their GDP is from services.

797 2018-07-30 22:02:37 Replied in the other thread. All I'm saying is if we sell our deadwood, we're back to a net spend like most windows as a cumulative average. Weren't you FSG out then? Let's not be run by oil money, but spend more than the club's below us.

800 2018-07-30 22:02:15 Skincare experts: What oil-free moisturizers do you recommend for oily/acne prone skin? I’ve been using coconut oil and I think my face is slowly just feeling more oily each day

809 2018-07-30 22:01:11 The government of Tuvalu has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Chris Klein in a tweed wig.
810 2018-07-30 22:00:59 General do you think this could be part of a bigger plan to work with Russia and the one Saudi Prince in creating a new oil Trio and control more of the world market?

821 2018-07-30 21:59:57 1st, Iran will not meet with Trump unilaterally. They would demand he honour the 6 party agreement already in place.
2nd, Iran is strengthening its ties with Russia to sell oil through them to get around sanctions.
3rd Iran has started to increase its uranium enrichment capacity.
822 2018-07-30 21:59:54 You guys are so full of it your eyes are brown. If you weren't hell bent on land locking Canadian resources but why no protest on foreign oil its has little or no environmental standards. HYPOCRITES. I support Canadian jobs and Canadian oil and gas
823 2018-07-30 21:59:41 The article refers to "the idea of imminent peak oil" (which was a topic of wide discussion in 2008). Why are you misrepresenting it ?
 
The asteroid belt doesn't appear to have any obvious relevance in the next few decades - are  any companies proposing exploiting this now ?
824 2018-07-30 21:59:24 Great, @maitlis actually asks "Who funds you?" Great work. About time these shysters, snake oil salesmen, and puppets are held to account! But saying "we're in the register" isn't answering "what was discussed and minuted" - they are not minuting meetings ffs!

835 2018-07-30 21:57:50 I made chocolate brownies once that came out like soil. Have also severely burnt an oven pizza on holiday which set the cottage complex fire alarm off, permanently scarred myself in hot oil and made an apple crumble at school even my parents couldn’t stomach. You’ll be okay 
836 2018-07-30 21:57:43 with olive oil (kind of like a sealant) and it keeps it reasonably fresh, then I just mix in the oil. If I have half an avocado I leave it in the skin and with the pit in and cover with olive oil and put in Tupperware too.

840 2018-07-30 21:57:17 Seriously though the people who want Alberta to separate are idiots. We’re a land locked province so our only way to bring our oil product to market would be to Canada or the USA with no way of shipping it abroad. Fucking genius.
841 2018-07-30 21:57:15 Literally the easiest thing ever... split shells, drizzle with olive oil, salt/pepper... shell side up on the grill for 7 minutes, flip for 7 minutes, baste with melted butter/herbs... take off when bright red [lobster emoji pending]
842 2018-07-30 21:57:07 Coconut oil is awesome for that, too. I found out when I recently rainbowed both my hair and my tits

844 2018-07-30 21:57:05 That was not a conversation you had with me. And that question shd be posed to the gentleman you were discussing that point with and not me. I however, do not believe that "all" the money was stolen, but I do believe a material part of our oil and gas commonwealth was plundered.
845 2018-07-30 21:57:02 mash it up, add lemon or lime juice, generous amount of salt and pepper, sometimes a little olive oil, then whatever other seasoning sounds good to me or good with what ever else I’m making. I really like it on toast or a bagel with sliced tomatoes, I add it onto my normal

On those documents you see how

terrorists including ISIS, & AL Qaeda

850 2018-07-30 21:56:29 Yes, it IS that simple. Snake oil has ALWAYS been there, but it took REAL  imagination to think of SELLING it, and dumb as a stump customers to actually BUY it...

858 2018-07-30 21:55:37 Hmm. So, a few things here.
First, this is a good point, but there are some caveats. While Norway's oil is a big factor, I would imagine it falls mostly under the exports section of GDP, not consumption, which is where I was focusing here.

And if the price of #oil is still controlled/set by OPEC/Russia, it's not really "energy independent" is it? 
874 2018-07-30 21:52:46 What I don't understand is we know humans are responsible for the ever expanding Sahara desert & all it's environmental impacts, so why do we think what we are doing to the rainforests for palm oil won't have an impact?
875 2018-07-30 21:52:27 Honestly, if you can have dairy, butter is the best thing ever. I would rather people use it than a can of heavily processed veggible oil that doesn't taste right.

888 2018-07-30 21:50:40 Realistically, you just need a low-temp frying agent. I just like butter more than coconut oil, myself! Of course, gnocchi work just as well in a thicker sauce, or even just with a seasoning of salt and pepper, if that's your taste.

909 2018-07-30 21:46:47 I think with oil the availability of rail/truck means you can be more conservative with pipe commitments and therefore less overbuild risk…but scale of Permian seems to obviate the rail/trucking backstop.

917 2018-07-30 21:45:45 Solar? Certainly not in the UK. Land requirement far too high. If a third of palm oil used for biofuels the that could be 15000 square miles, and rising.

979 2018-07-30 21:36:29 cooking eggs in olive oil gets the egg all nice and crispy because the oil's like ooh you're not supposed to be frying things in me you naughty boy ;)
980 2018-07-30 21:36:23 I just feel they're finding a way not to be held ransom by the south... If they can find enough crude oil reserves in those regions... Then the south can FOH...
981 2018-07-30 21:36:23 The “Deep Nutrition” book is stunning. It says fish oil is unstable outside the fish and immediately breaks down into toxic byproducts.
982 2018-07-30 21:36:22 Oil export values does not automatically translate to Government revenue.
983 2018-07-30 21:36:06 Great - I have been on it for 4 months and can't really tell anything as of yet. I do make my own with highest c60 and Avocado oil and spin it for two weeks in a dark room - I do not use a filter.
984 2018-07-30 21:36:02 My dad wants to turn me into a mechanic so bad .He was teaching me how to change car oil ,tires and disconnect the battery today.And I broke all my nails 
985 2018-07-30 21:35:59 Dear future husband- you're going to have to get used to me coming home covered in oil, dirt and grease....
986 2018-07-30 21:35:54 NOTHING feels better than stepping out of a hot shower and rubbing everything down with coconut oil 
987 2018-07-30 21:35:52 80 dollars for an oil change what in the fuck. full synthetic oil dumb expensive 
988 2018-07-30 21:35:23 Probably a good way to send oneself into a tailspin of depression over the fact that politicians of the late 18th century writing by the dim light of an oil lamp each had more functioning neurons than the entirety of the present Congress.
989 2018-07-30 21:35:13 And that folks is why reality tv is the biggest load of balls. Imagine sharing the money oil tanker ffs.

993 2018-07-30 21:34:59 You stand in a room with curved walls, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a nightstand.
994 2018-07-30 21:34:42 welcome to oil ocean
995 2018-07-30 21:34:39 Not when you compare oil and gas north of the border to south.  North Dakota and Utah are buzzing and its still a dude in Canada.  Why?  Pipeline capacity?  Taxes?  Regulations?
996 2018-07-30 21:34:26 It's pretty liberal there for sure ... we have a great @GovAbbott but so many ppl moved from CA because of their taxes & economy & they've stayed...ugh! I'm in W.TX & we see license plates from EVERY state in the Union, even Hawaii...crazy! Oil industry still booming!
997 2018-07-30 21:34:26 You got any hair crack oil in mist bottles
998 2018-07-30 21:34:09 @CatherineBizTV I have two questions:  If there is a glut of L48 natural gas, why are  storage inventories at 16-year lows?  Who has the most to gain financially by blocking Canadian oil pipeline expansions?  Rail companies, US oil producers, OPEC....?

1017 2018-07-30 21:31:18 BTW, what climate costs? I hope you are prepared to prove oil causes climate.
1018 2018-07-30 21:31:18 Just the spin of leftists and general economic illiteracy of some Americans. Would be a huge win for retirees specifically divesting of assets subject to cap gains
1019 2018-07-30 21:31:13 7 x RNS 4 x Fully ladden Oil Tankers that we know of could be more sent to BP. The last being on Friday. I'd say #UKOG are doing a good job. Clearly upsetting some with the Gatwick Gushers success so far at #Horsehill .

1028 2018-07-30 21:30:17 The only “climate costs” are the enormous, unnecessary costs of wind and solar. Oil has provided us with cheap, abundant energy that resulted in us having the highest standard of living and greatest economy. I thank them  every day.

1038 2018-07-30 21:29:18 On MSNBC tonight BRIAN WILLIAMS. Monday 30 July. 11 PM ET. Trump and Iran situation. US sanctions will have huge impact on their economy. Danger they cut off flow of oil thru Straits of Hormuz. In my judgement we would employ force.

1040 2018-07-30 21:28:39 I am obsessed lol. I use oils to cleanse and moisturize at night. My faves are argan and rosehip seed as moisturizers and I use a cleansing oil as my face wash. I’ve seen much better results with my skin from using these

1044 2018-07-30 21:27:36 We do have a men's line called PC4MEN, but our Moisture Renewal Oil Booster actually works great for those with beards!
1045 2018-07-30 21:27:22 As another toner I guess. I still use my witch hazel as my regular toner and use the lemon oil after my moisturizer
1046 2018-07-30 21:27:16 Yes yes
I will bring my massage oil
I like to think that im good at massages :3
1047 2018-07-30 21:27:13 I bought my dog CBD salmon oil and accidentally drank some while trying to twist the cap off with my mouth. How’s your Monday?
1048 2018-07-30 21:27:07 That’s definitely the idea. I personally am a fan of the full pan sear in a cast iron/steel pan with oil and butter, but crank that oven as hot as it can and make sure to pull it about 10 degrees cooler than you want it, then let it rest on a cutting board for another 3-4 min
1049 2018-07-30 21:27:05 That’s not the typical setting na. Its the only the ones affiliated to oil companies that are making huge gains
1050 2018-07-30 21:26:36 Sounds a bit profligate to me....but I might be tempted to place slightly more moderate bet. Food Bank Britain....well at least we've got food to spare, unlike the oil rich socialist paradise Venezuela.
1051 2018-07-30 21:26:28 Additional Oil Benefits!   Hair and Nails Growing Like Weeds, Better Sleep, Better Breathing, Better Pain Relief, Lessened Anxiety, Better Mood, Being Regular, the list goes on and ON!!
1052 2018-07-30 21:26:25 True - but organised disinformation by oil companies via network of right wing think tanks could have calamitous results on a scale far exceeding any World War or Holocaust. Maybe this won't happen. But even to risk this merely to protect profits is unforgivable

1067 2018-07-30 21:23:47 I started using lemon oil on my face for my dark spots and it’s like day 3 and I’m already seeing progress. 
1068 2018-07-30 21:23:38 It's really, really difficult to avoid it, first in student restaurants, second in my country's cooking culture in general. Tho fish oil supplements are always available option.
1069 2018-07-30 21:23:34 My get rich scheme involves making my own oils for cologne. gimme a year until I figure out how to make oil and it’s over for the cologne industry.
1070 2018-07-30 21:23:34 To be fair I bleached my hair five times in a month and it only started to break on the fifth time. Hair strength varies, but just condition it with coconut oil over night and look after it - you’ll be fine! 
1071 2018-07-30 21:23:22 People treat me like I'm oil and they're water, I don't get it, I'm not that different or wrong am I?
1072 2018-07-30 21:22:54 Yeah, this is around the time the Billboard Top 10 was really starting to leak oil, and things haven't been the same since.

1078 2018-07-30 21:22:18 my hands and face are still on fire from getting jalapeño oil on them and then trying to wash it off, several hours ago
1079 2018-07-30 21:21:56 I predicted imminent peak oil in 2008 ? I mentioned that it was an idea, but I certainly didn't predict it.

Solar is renewable - solar panels last 30+ years and can be recycled. 

Nuclear is a dying energy technology - too expensive and slow to build.

Space resources ???
1080 2018-07-30 21:21:53 Top 3 halal restaurants on TripAdvisor in London is Turkish and Middle Eastern.

U having a fucking laugh mate.

You could drink olive oil anywhere in this fucking city
1081 2018-07-30 21:21:51 You know what never gets old? Having to climb into the engine of your car to put more oil in bc it’s a big truck and your a little girl and you can’t reach it any other way.
1082 2018-07-30 21:21:39 yeah i plan digitally to sort proportions and stuff but that's about it. they're all different styles and take time, like minimal line drawings vs big detailed oil paintings. some digital stuff does save time though, but i guess they see it as working smarter
1083 2018-07-30 21:21:38 What do you use? Oil wise and for a moisturizer
1084 2018-07-30 21:21:35 We'll have to bath him several times to make sure he's clean then rub him down with oil several times. 
We need to plan on staying at least a month..

1086 2018-07-30 21:21:15 I have never gotten an oil change and I got this car on my 15th birthday
1087 2018-07-30 21:21:03 It’s that sweet Detroit accent. Probably too much motor oil as a kid.
1088 2018-07-30 21:20:58 OPEC just released data on all the monies PDP has received from Oil trade in 16 years and it is almost 800 billion dollars that PDP has received with nothing to show for it while PMB has only received about 94 billion dollars. WoW.
1089 2018-07-30 21:20:35 Oil up
1090 2018-07-30 21:20:34 Energy companies should be innovating for the future and moving away from oil instead of spending insane amounts of money to make us losers in the renewables race.
1091 2018-07-30 21:20:33 Butter all day long for me or something like Bertoli with Olive Oil, to hell with whether it's healthy or not, I just want it to taste yummy in my tummy! 
1092 2018-07-30 21:20:25 I've learned a lot with having longer hair now. How important it is to have oil in it and not always keeping it tied.
1093 2018-07-30 21:20:21 he is part of the "middle east institute" sponsored by the giants of the war machine industry and of course big oil !
1094 2018-07-30 21:19:51 Today i realized you can wipe your car interior down with Murphy’s Oil, and i got so hype cause that’s like my favorite smell ever.

1106 2018-07-30 21:18:34 Sometimes if my skin looks a little... flaky?... I use a combo of brown sugar and olive oil as a gentle fingertip scrub. Is that okay?
1107 2018-07-30 21:18:28 Simple stuff!  Mix engine oil and fuel and pour it in there and you're good to go. Thank me later
1108 2018-07-30 21:18:21 *shudder* I shop-vacced out a whole nest once and sprayed pure peppermint oil in there.  And see my next tweet - I've had this problem more than once!
1109 2018-07-30 21:18:16 Looks like you missed your own prediction "imminent peak oil".  Your prediction was in 2008...You don't understand that PV is not renewable, and indeed to expensive to produce without an oil based economy, and discount nuclear and don't even mention resources from space.

1112 2018-07-30 21:17:21 It's like socializing car maintenance but only once the car breaks down, not any of the oil changes.

This doesn't mean the car maintenance is less socialized it's just socialized in a poorer manner.

1114 2018-07-30 21:17:17 Anche tune oil doveva andá in ferie, si risparmiava le stronzate che ha cantato
1115 2018-07-30 21:17:12 is it stupid that i didn’t realize olive oil was green?
1116 2018-07-30 21:16:41 Just be ready to flip it upside down to let the oil mix properly.
1117 2018-07-30 21:16:38 u can get them at any smoke shop but the THC oil cartridges need to be purchased illegally lol
1118 2018-07-30 21:16:31 Girl I did too but the “change oil soon” indicator on my car keeps popping up on my dashboard lol
1119 2018-07-30 21:16:22 If someone told me that egg yolk got rid of acne you'd see me smother my face in egg. I'm desperate rn. All this aloe gel and tea tree oil is making me angry.
1120 2018-07-30 21:16:21 How do you preserve them with oil? I have done some with vinegar and some as natural ferments with brine...
1121 2018-07-30 21:15:56 I cooked in the pitch black tonight. Haute cuisine repas: flash fried minute steak, instant mash, tinned haricots verts with olive oil and loads of butter in the spuds.
1122 2018-07-30 21:15:53 He also bombed innocent countries for oil and religious reasons

1123 2018-07-30 21:15:36 “Swing oil” is pretty powerful!
1124 2018-07-30 21:15:28 Cucumber avocado salad drizzled with olive oil and salt and pepper... yummm
1125 2018-07-30 21:15:26 Oga your own party are confused too, during your 16years in power pls tell Nigerians your achievements. Not one refinery in oil producing country work perfectly. Here u are telling us to vote em out Neither APC or PDP can save this country.
1126 2018-07-30 21:15:15 Yes! Salt & a little olive oil does the trick!!
1127 2018-07-30 21:14:43 @Inceptiongirl15 His hat, I tried zooming to get better look, but looks like an oil rig promo hat. See them all the time in okla
1128 2018-07-30 21:14:33 .....my manager had to remind me that I need to go get an oil change tomorrow since I'm off. Why am I allowed to be an adult?
1129 2018-07-30 21:14:26 Globalists plan to de-industrialize the West, excessive 'environmentalism' like banning straws, their 'war of Fossil-fuels' is part of that!, However their factories in China+3rd world will never have pollution controls or a reduction in Oil+Gas use!
1130 2018-07-30 21:14:10 She is out of her mind. Oboma had this country in disaster state. All manufacturers had left to other country’s. Gas,coal,oil was at a standstill. He put us in dept. barrowed more than all presidents combined. Waters needs a mental evaluation.
1131 2018-07-30 21:13:55 The lavender World's Best in the purple bag. I use the red is it's on sale and spray with witch hazel and lavender oil. Only scent the cats don't mind.
1132 2018-07-30 21:13:40 I was thinking, "Hold on, dear, just need to reach the massage oil."
1133 2018-07-30 21:13:28 It’s a producer rigged vote if Laura and Paul win, I will throw a my oil burner at the tv if they win #loveIsIand

1135 2018-07-30 21:13:23 Wondering why snake oil salespeople appear to go unchallenged.
1136 2018-07-30 21:13:10 coconut oil is the answer to all life's questions.
1137 2018-07-30 21:13:09 I think I’m sick.  I like Kale.  Onion, portobello, coconut oil, a dash of adobo, stir fry, it’s a deal!
1138 2018-07-30 21:13:06 I love baby oil but hate babies.
1139 2018-07-30 21:13:04 A smidge of lavender oil with a tad of coconut oil, rub in well on a paw pad. Doesn't work on me lol, works on puppy real good. I keep her busy, no licking it.
Also, those expensive thunder shirts? Buy a few cheap shirts until you find a size that fits snug. It's like a hug.
1140 2018-07-30 21:13:03 Like they drink some oil before going out to drink alcohol
1141 2018-07-30 21:13:01 Extra Virgin olive oil, maybe 
1142 2018-07-30 21:12:48 Believing we can burn coal and oil forever, as well as dump methane and CFCs into the atmosphere, and have ZERO impact, is... frankly, ridiculous.
1143 2018-07-30 21:12:39 RSHO c'est pas aussi Rick Simpson's Hemp Oil ? Ça me fait penser à ça mais je trip peut-être
1144 2018-07-30 21:12:33 I love olive oil but hate olives

1146 2018-07-30 21:12:01 These sort of articles are increasing in number as some automakers and oil companies feel the squeeze. They are often written by those with little experience or real knowledge of EV driving. @au_tom_otive @106Euan @ecocars1 @She_sElectric @bobbyllew @FullyChargedShw
1147 2018-07-30 21:11:42 @TheJuanWilliams @TheFive  ask Juan what states are in the most term oil and who is their leaders 
Answer: democrats
1148 2018-07-30 21:11:39 
1149 2018-07-30 21:11:34 No. We absolutely know what CO2 does to an atmosphere (we can see runaway greenhouse effect on Venus), and that we're artificially dumping way too much of it, way too quickly, into the Earth's atmosphere. Had we left the crude oil under the earth, we wouldn't have 100F in Canada

1151 2018-07-30 21:11:19 Black castor oil >>>
1152 2018-07-30 21:11:18 Yeah why not. Corporations don't care about any body. Let's do a little math. Imagine the gov has $130 b, plus money from oil companies, medicine, insurance all major industries. Eventually the gov will have enough wealth to distribute  instead of borrowing $ 2 b every 3 days.

Can u give a vivid reason, let's not argue this, we are here cos of Yesterday's wastages

1176 2018-07-30 21:08:04 Metals are bought on a commodity exchange (Chicago is the largest) and contracts will be written based on an expected price on the market. It's similar to fluctuations in oil/gas prices.
1177 2018-07-30 21:07:53 the dog track regulators who are the PUPPET MASTERS of ALL THOSE STUPID CROWS have been FIXING oil prices and nobody seems to care
1178 2018-07-30 21:07:50 In light of Brexit, ITV have announced that Love Island 2019 will be based in a caravan park in South Wales.

1183 2018-07-30 21:07:08 Baby oil for me & him btw xx
1184 2018-07-30 21:07:06 What kind of oil? How does this work? I don't understand 
1185 2018-07-30 21:07:01 Ran out of oil before the heatwave and now I need some!
1186 2018-07-30 21:06:55 MMT: selling economic snake oil and the sharpest knives you'll ever find, since 1995!
1187 2018-07-30 21:06:50 These shows got me in all sorts of emotion.
1188 2018-07-30 21:06:48 When oil prices were plummeting and demand was slowing, China kept on pumping. Today oil prices have risen and the analysts' questions have been answered.
1189 2018-07-30 21:06:29 Oil pan
1190 2018-07-30 21:06:29 I'll take a perk a water and akasalt and don't forget to put my salt in my water and keep my oil on my nite stand

1193 2018-07-30 21:06:19 Tatambay muna ako dito
1194 2018-07-30 21:05:46 It's because they receive free allocation from FG every month, from money made from sale of  crude oil from the Niger delta. 
It's only restructuring that will cute such madness.
1195 2018-07-30 21:05:45 The way some Ladies are attracted to cars ehn!, you will even think they were breastfed with engine oil
1196 2018-07-30 21:05:44 Hey Olive Oil where is Popeye
1197 2018-07-30 21:05:37 The only thing holding up the US economy is the US Dollar being the worlds reserve currency for oil , having a monopoly on ALL OIL SALES. Our top ten exports are resource commodities. Economically we are a third world nation Wolf at the Gate .

1201 2018-07-30 21:05:15 Exactly, CNN is bullshit. Rachel Maddow is almost single handedly holding these snake oil salesman accountable. Nance, Yates, and Watts are also out there shedding light. Change your channel or kill your TV.
1202 2018-07-30 21:05:03 Put a generous amount of coconut oil through your hair 30 minutes before you shower. & when you shampoo & condition don’t rinse the conditioner completely out!
1203 2018-07-30 21:05:00 you have great cheese . As for Hummus, all the best can be grown and found in the u.k, might help you out with some decent olive oil though

1216 2018-07-30 21:02:59 Don’t forget $443 million in April 2018 to the Great Barrier Reef Fundation which is deeply aligned to oil and coal industry. NLP are monsters.
1217 2018-07-30 21:02:57 Why am seeing this for the first time? and why hasn't a oil painting made of this yet?
1218 2018-07-30 21:02:56 Absolutely, it's time! They started running of places to drill. Started on preserves Native land. What was thought was worthless land. They discovered natural resources. Now back to land Grabbing for what dey can profit off. Water is life, need to protect from GREEDY OIL CO!!
1219 2018-07-30 21:02:54 Good evening time to get this motor oil that lasts for 10,000 miles guaranteed or money back

1227 2018-07-30 21:01:38 I’m not sure about this...  oil and gas companies drill under neighborhoods all the time.  No need to burn the houses up.  Horizontal drilling is used in the Denver area and neighborhoods are drilled under constantly in the Wattenburg field.
1228 2018-07-30 21:01:20 Confirmed my doctors appt, got an oil change, and now getting a car wash, is this adulting?
1229 2018-07-30 21:01:17 The GOP is so proud of how trump made sure all his cabinet members were in charge of departments they want to destroy.

No matter which end of the political spectrum you hale from... that is just scandalous mismanagement of our economy... gross incompetence, not security.
1232 2018-07-30 21:01:02 A refinery and pipeline for crude oil coming from Niger Republic.... If you really paid attention, you'll know this.

If you construe this as evidence of my love for Buhari, it's your cup of tea
1233 2018-07-30 21:00:41 RIP & god bless you mum. She taught my brothers and me everything...soft skills and how to cook, sew, iron...  - the independent skills. It’s always been best person for the job in my mind and I’ve come through a male dominated oil industry. But we’re getting there I think.

1242 2018-07-30 20:59:44 Questions to ask leftists: Why was pedophilia so prolific under Obama (Bush, Clinton), and NOT Trump? Why is it a good thing to buy oil from foreign sources? Why should unelected officials govern your local resources? Why are we happy with government involvement in our lives?

1251 2018-07-30 20:58:41 Happened to me when I went for an interview in an oil company in VI. HR caught me and started laughing.
1252 2018-07-30 20:58:32 Science based policy stands in the way of this corrupt administration's short sighted plans of oil, gas, timber & mineral extraction from our #publiclands
1253 2018-07-30 20:58:23 The year is 2058. Humanity has depleted all of its fuel sources, except for one; Oil from the faces of teenage boys.
1254 2018-07-30 20:58:23 As I've mentioned before you also ignore SWAP deals (which have occurred under this govt and the last) you ignore that we share the oil revenue with partners, you ignore oil for infrastructure deals you've ignored a lot to make a partisan point that's false.
1255 2018-07-30 20:58:20 Y’all I know I asked this before but how much am I supposed to pay for an oil change? For synthetic oil
1256 2018-07-30 20:58:20 What is @Google paying for access to very big data? Ps. Data is the new oil!
1257 2018-07-30 20:58:06 We need oil slicked walls.  Any cheap oil will do.  Come legal or keep out.
1258 2018-07-30 20:57:44 I'd love to join you, but I haven't bought Walkers crisps since they changed the oil a few years back. They now taste like shite, and leave your mouth feeling like you've been out siphoning diesel all night.
1259 2018-07-30 20:57:35 THIS IS NOT A DIAGNOSIS FOR CONCUSSION. Incorrect reporting even though slightly clarified in the story. The quote however that ONE biomarker is adequate is pure snake oil. Only muddies the already murky water further.

1265 2018-07-30 20:56:03 Weird how the "no blood for oil" crowed changed to ardent defenders of American Imperium.
1266 2018-07-30 20:55:36 Hell, the @GOP would burn the corpses if they thought they could squeeze out a gram of oil.
1267 2018-07-30 20:55:30 There is up n down inside there, oil n petroleum  are taking their position... I'm thinking about a car
1268 2018-07-30 20:55:29 I loooooooove tea tree oil so much so this is probably what I’ll go with 
1269 2018-07-30 20:55:17 lots of vegan foods contain palm oil too .. its sad
1270 2018-07-30 20:55:15 Drink red oil. Stop drinking.   
1271 2018-07-30 20:55:10  my favorite thing after shaving~~ dousing myself in coconut oil and being all slippery hehehehe

1274 2018-07-30 20:54:35 Just dropped that Santa Fe off for an oil change because I’m a pleb. Stream should be up around 6-7 pm cst
1275 2018-07-30 20:54:34 It's very helpful in proving my point, thank you. Do you see where it says total revenue from oil and gas, the revenue is shared by Nigerias partners including the oil majors and all tiers of govt. I compared revenue to budget because your original point was  GEJ stole all
1276 2018-07-30 20:54:25 So excited about my new cleansing balm!! It has African black soap, bee propolis, black seed oil, hemp seed oil AND MORE!
Will take even the heaviest of makeup & cleanse skin
1277 2018-07-30 20:54:24 @mmschocolate Please stop using palm oil.
1278 2018-07-30 20:54:20 @JMV1070 not directly colts related, but how about when the Giants beat the Pats in Lucas Oil at Super Bowl XLVI #Fan10
1279 2018-07-30 20:54:05 wish my parents understood that cooking stuff in chilli oil instead of olive oil does not count as seasoning
1280 2018-07-30 20:53:59 Life saver. I put so much oil though. If I gain weight in the next week, you know why. 
1281 2018-07-30 20:53:53 and he's all set to ruin Alaska. Let's drill for oil in the most pristine wilderness we can find, kill animals, and make sure we spill the oil into ever ecosystem imaginable.
1282 2018-07-30 20:53:42 EPA algae oil, better sleep, exercise, no drugs, positive people around me, and a new willingness to fail in order to succeed eventually.
1283 2018-07-30 20:53:41 Standard gas is good for about a year without an additional stabilizer.  Diesel good for about 2 years. That is a key flaw in #WalkingDead ... no gas would be viable beyond 2 years yet they are driving more than ever in year 7-8?  Would be down to modded diesels running veg oil.
1284 2018-07-30 20:53:35 Food for thought.

Buhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with us as a country? 
Ref : Vicki
1285 2018-07-30 20:53:27 And the Dems think negotiating with dictators makes him Hitler.  PRes Trump is destroying them: trade war with China where we have all the leverage; oil war with Russia where we are now #1 in production.  Pres Trump is a dream come true.
1286 2018-07-30 20:53:19 It actually makes burning the midnight oil a bit more bearable
1287 2018-07-30 20:53:14 I’m wearing an essential oil instead of a perfume today and I feel like a new woman, one who smells like a lemon goddess
1288 2018-07-30 20:53:14 It doesn't look too old, probably 30 years at most.
They either deferred maintenance (checking oil characteristics can predict when a transformer will fail), or a recent lightning strike damaged the insulation.
1289 2018-07-30 20:53:10 Would be good if someone could get you some CBD oil, cannabis to vape/edibles or even better whole plant cannabis oil. Hope it eases
1290 2018-07-30 20:53:06 Linda, As I understand, CBD OIL IS LEGAL NOW EVERYWHERE. Go to the website (LEAFLY) and you’ll have it in 3 days.!I have to order it every week ! Just load the app LEAFLY ! Now, LOL!
1291 2018-07-30 20:53:06 This investment would undoubtedly open up Bayelsa to the world . The oil industry is sure to take advantage of this strategic facility to boost their operations inntge Niger Delta
1292 2018-07-30 20:52:53 Good luck to Tucker, Ryan and @Holly_Shelton4 ! 
1293 2018-07-30 20:52:42 It's just not about nails... the cuticles has to be shaved down, you have to oil the cuticles, that clear/white line between your nail & cuticle shouldn't be there...PAY ATTENTION NAIL TECHS!

1296 2018-07-30 20:52:12 Frankincense essential oil has been known to enhance the beauty of the skin! It's used in all of the products that will be in my blog post tomorrow, any guesses as to what it's about?
1297 2018-07-30 20:52:04 Getting a new car is all great till you realize you have payments, oil changes, car repairs, insurance and gas. Shit never ends.
1298 2018-07-30 20:52:00 It’s always slightly unsettling when massage therapy oil makes you smell a bit like a well-turned wooden leg (or maybe a fancy banister) that’s been fashioned on a lathe, instead of your normal floral and patchouli scent. Just a wee bit unsettling...
1299 2018-07-30 20:51:58 Um I'm in a small olive oil shop and they're playing Dress... excuse me
1300 2018-07-30 20:51:57 If only car oil changes didn’t take long
1301 2018-07-30 20:51:56 Sorry @JMV1070 #1 on my top 10 will always be Butler’s back to back National Championship run. Especially the Duke game at Lucas Oil. Best sporting event I’ve ever been to
1302 2018-07-30 20:51:54 Oil price has gone up o. Nothing has happen. No difference between 4 years and 3 years.
1303 2018-07-30 20:51:47 Can CBD oil be detected with a work based urine test ?
1304 2018-07-30 20:51:25 Well I read somewhere that roll-ons cause cancer. Coconut oil is antibacterial. So it serves the same purpose as roll-ons and keeps your armpits moist, instead of dry and black.

1322 2018-07-30 20:48:36 Don’t see the Dutch turning off the tap, do you? If push came to shove, the treasury could easily and quickly cut tax and increase capital allowances. You would know much more about this, hasn’t the Government moved them around a lot in the past for oil industry?

1330 2018-07-30 20:47:06 Hi! Our avocado oil is not green due to the refining process which removes impurities such as Vitamin E, naturally occurring waxes, free fatty acids, and chlorophyll. In doing so, the shelf life is extended, it has a higher smoke point and a neutral flavor.
1331 2018-07-30 20:47:06 Chef Louis cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Silly Putty.
1332 2018-07-30 20:47:00 Spots are filling fast for the adult workshop, Portrait Oil Painting! For painting students new to portraiture, as well as those with more experience, this workshop will focus on challenges such as proportion, rule-of-thirds, value control, and color mixing. #MAMmontclair
1333 2018-07-30 20:46:58 The oil painting is of Hagen’s tee shot on the 72nd hole of the Open Championship. His 16 year old caddy was given the £100 winner’s check. A week later Hagen player a casual round with the future King of England. #golfhistory Should have kept that bag!!!
1334 2018-07-30 20:46:45 But the first girl in that BSO article said she didnt really know budnic at all? And she just gave the dude $300? That's amazing. I need to just start DMing folks "if you give me $100 I'll buy CBD oil and it will change me" and I'll never buy CBD oil but tell you I did.
1335 2018-07-30 20:46:25 When the tariffs kick in (the effect of them) in the next 2 months we’ll see that. Oil prices already at the highest since 2014/5
1336 2018-07-30 20:46:09 Do you put oil in a frying pan to cook bacon ?????? I don’t eat fucking meat ???
1337 2018-07-30 20:46:07 The consistency is really hard to get right – my husband came up with a good recipe that involved mixing decent quality chocolate with oil or something like that. So much faff though… #bathindiechat
1338 2018-07-30 20:46:02 omg I’ve been at Crevier mini since 10:40...just to get an oil change...this is insane
1339 2018-07-30 20:46:00 Snicker... transparency and Trump, oil and water. Congress could subpoena Cohen, Trump Jr, right now, open hearings. Wonder why they don't..couldn't be they've (GOP) got something to hide, or they don't want the truth out there. Doesn't matter what we tweet, Mueller's staying.

1346 2018-07-30 20:45:38 Socialism works great for those who push it, just like Snake Oil salesmen of earlier times.. Drink at your own risk...
1347 2018-07-30 20:45:13 Coconut oil (or any similar oil really) will wipe it right off with a paper towel. Then all you have to do is wash the excess oil and makeup residue which is a LOT easier

Never mind the animals, palm oil is a very unhealthy oil to consume! Get rid of it from processed foods!#DitchPalmOil !

1352 2018-07-30 20:44:32 Buying friends and influencing people springs to mind! The Arab has the money to do that and therefore avoid the criticism! At least we spend or invest only money we earn rather than relying on an oil rich sugar daddy!! Do you think pep had heard of city in 2007?
1353 2018-07-30 20:44:25 Anyone know where I can find peanut butter with no hydrogenated oil????

1355 2018-07-30 20:44:07 Not related, I've made a special sauce I use at the restaurant before. It's:
gochugaru (pepper flake powder), chopped garlic, spices, salt, msg, scallions, etc. Then pour super hot veggie oil with some sesame mixed in, it will bubble up and smell super delicious.
1356 2018-07-30 20:43:59 Just Got My Oil Changed
1357 2018-07-30 20:43:57 *drives 7 miles*
*car goes from 87 to 80 miles*
Me: wtf??? Gas is such a scam fuck the oil industry fuck capitalism
1358 2018-07-30 20:43:57 It’s true tho.. You can go in for an oil change & they’ll tell you 2 other things that are wrong when they’re really not.. they target women bc they expect us to not know anything about cars and go with it..
1359 2018-07-30 20:43:55 I want to do an oil painting of Kermit
1360 2018-07-30 20:43:46 If you want to get to 175K - change the oil and rotate the tires every 5K - do not skip that even once - look at your undercarriage and see if it needs a clear coat -  and at 125K consider a new paint job. Also, I am not talking about cars.
1361 2018-07-30 20:43:36 Why arent people calling ether digital oil yet ? We are yet to discover digital equivalents of many commodities.
1362 2018-07-30 20:43:24 If you set your ABH with a powder it takes care of the smudging! I would set with with NYX’s brow powder and when my ABH pot gets dry a drop of vitamin e oil does the trick!
1363 2018-07-30 20:43:22 This^ this right here, this and the discovery of crude oil.
1364 2018-07-30 20:43:06 We could just use hemp instead and we’d probably save the planet like no oil, no plastic, less paper would be a lot better

1367 2018-07-30 20:42:39 .@Evine Do women realize the product "Flawless" Facial Hair Remover is just an electric razor, similar to floating heads of Norelco, that "hair remover" is a mislead, and shaving promotes additional growth and hair? Watch out for snake oil...

1370 2018-07-30 20:42:27 The next person to ask me if my job is being the shops “little helper” I’m gonna screw their goddamn oil drain plug on so tight they’ll never get an oil change A G A I N
1371 2018-07-30 20:42:13 Chocolate cake toddler hack.. use canned pumpkin rather than oil eggs add water .. it makes a yummy cake & kids can eat the batter
1372 2018-07-30 20:42:10 Trying Castor Oil for my skin and hair.. From what I heard hopefully it will work.
1373 2018-07-30 20:41:39 I mean, what are you supposed to do with the oil? Are you supposed to consume it with the tuna? Are you supposed to drain it? You can't drain it down the sink or your sink will eventually clog. What do you do with the oil!?!?!?!
1374 2018-07-30 20:41:13 I just found a transcribed oral history of Bradford at the library. It contains quite a few stories about the whorehouses of the oil boom days, and in particular, a madam named Big Tit Lil. I need a documentary about this, stat.
1375 2018-07-30 20:41:11 ...Investment firms surely coordinate with their governments and by colluding with other governments and their respective investment firms manipulate the price of oil and currencies of countries, which should be illegal if it's not. Consumers need to sue. System needs changed.
1376 2018-07-30 20:41:09 It's interesting how everyone who is in favor of a new oil pipeline, and swears up and down it's safe, would refuse to live next door to it themselves.
1377 2018-07-30 20:40:54 We don’t protest enough in this country. Student loans and oil prices go up you’ll see Molotov’s being thrown overseas. I ain’t saying burn some shit down, but you’d hope to at least see more push back than an Online petition
1378 2018-07-30 20:40:29 OIL working for me, in me and through me.
1379 2018-07-30 20:40:19 Will never forget the hot chocolate with - I think? - Lucuma powder and coconut oil u made me back in the bad days!
1380 2018-07-30 20:40:16 I'll sponsor the first kids permit to sell sun tan lotion and olive oil if the promise to price gauge. Dms open.
1381 2018-07-30 20:40:15 Same. Comparing the variety of foods available in certain categories now v then is illuminating—vinegar, mustard, oil, bread.

1385 2018-07-30 20:39:49 He's a snake oil salesman. His wealth depends on him coming up with big new ideas to get stupid investors to give him money so the value of his own shares increases. Americans are starting to see through the lies, hence the European story.

1388 2018-07-30 20:39:14 I don’t know about you, but I just love seeing everyone doing math right now. Like: toast 33 cents, avo $1.18, olive oil .27 cents, s&p 3 cents.....total $22. with delivery.

1390 2018-07-30 20:39:06 I tell you, if nature had distributed the fortunes of this country the other way round other than the way we have it now, I.e. the oil in the south south, in the North and vice versa, Nigeria would have became history since the first republic.
1391 2018-07-30 20:38:53 It’s just black oil paint scribbles on a blended smooth painted gradient, with some yellow highlights and clouds

1394 2018-07-30 20:38:28 Where is the evidence CC is "more accurate"? Agree it's more convenient for Big Oil to use a non-threatening term - it helped forestall change. Big Oil asked Luntz to help them #FrameTheDebate to pacify the public - they've been wildly successful. #GlobalWarming #ClimateCrisis
1395 2018-07-30 20:38:23 Ya boi helped rotate the tires and changed the oil in his Crocs!
1396 2018-07-30 20:38:16 So they went from a snake oil salesman (no one has done less with more) to an unproven head coach? Sounds like a lateral move to me.

1398 2018-07-30 20:38:10 Keystone XL pipeline gets a positive review on environmental impacts from State Department, Obama killed the XL to make Warren Buffet even richer from owning CSX RR who would carry oil without the XL...Obama used environmental impacts as a cover for Dems crony capitalism. Yup.

1404 2018-07-30 20:37:01 Idk! One doctor I work with says if we inhale the oil particles in the air, it stays in our lungs forever and builds up over time. Another says diffusers can help COPD, asthma, etc.

1414 2018-07-30 20:34:42 Oh I meant your natural hair!
But it’s just time for you to wash your weave. Either that or you’re putting too much heat on it. And sometimes putting oil on it can stop it from being silky.

1453 2018-07-30 20:29:20 I went into b&m today for shampoo and came out with Mac & cheese, beans, frisps, spray bleach, oil car air freshener, cat dental sticks, a candle, ash tray & extension lead. What a shop man

Oga wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state.I think integrity and vision is far from this Govt.
1455 2018-07-30 20:29:16 Certainly not, Oil is a curse for any country if found in large quantities --- Nigeria, Libya, Iraq, Venezula, Syria & next is Iran. S.Arabia is not hurt cuz 90% of oil sale goes to US for purchase of arms.
1456 2018-07-30 20:29:02 I use CBD oil when can afford. I am not sure about the aloe. I live in British Columbia, can I get in Amazon? Thanks for message.

1490 2018-07-30 20:24:14 Snake oil salesmen do not worry about reputation .
1491 2018-07-30 20:24:08 Unpleasant but allowing despots to influence oil supplies carries unknown downstream risks which neither you or I know. Mob criticism of Blair re Iraq from a position of 100% hindsight, given the complexity of possible outcomes, often communicates an irrational, vexatious motive.
1492 2018-07-30 20:24:02 I really should have trademarked this a couple of months ago.

1495 2018-07-30 20:23:50 Yah, pretty much.
I have been down this rabbit hole many times over the decades, and other than the odd troll or snake oil salesman, it eventually boils down to a trust and cognitive dissonance thing.

1512 2018-07-30 20:21:37 You are blessed @mydeji247 

Northern leaders and their love for oil are Siamese twins.

immediately @MBuhari became president, his first mission was to waste $3billion on the search for oil in the lake chad basin when recession was biting hard on the citizens.
1513 2018-07-30 20:21:36 This is why Trump should be negotiating with Mexico regarding their oil.  Mexico has lots of oil. We should find a way to work with them for their oil.  This way we do not have to depend on other far away countries for their oil.  Mexico is our neighbor we should deal with them.
1514 2018-07-30 20:21:35  oil but who's seen the new harvester advert
1515 2018-07-30 20:21:27 It may be complicated, but these environmental changes/catastrophes are all related to our needs. We have become more intrusive and less aware of what we’re doing. Take all of what we do in concert, and you have a perfect recipe for the apocalypse. More cell phone radiation. Oil.
1516 2018-07-30 20:21:24 hina has also been considering a multi-billion-dollar pipeline that would carry crude oil from Pakistan’s coastal port of Gwadar to Western China.

1518 2018-07-30 20:20:28 Strait of Malacca
Over in Asia, the second largest chokepoint, the Strait of Malacca, is extremely narrow – just 1.7 miles wide at its narrowest point. Through that Strait more than 16 mb/d of oil travels.
1519 2018-07-30 20:19:57 It’s obvious they’ll take advantage of the position they’ll be taking, geographically speaking, to drill a little further and maybe take Venezuelans oil. Maduro is not doing a thing, I don’t think he understands what’s going on. This is very bad...
1520 2018-07-30 20:19:51 I read an article that said canola oil breaks down into a trans fat.
1521 2018-07-30 20:19:45 It’s no wonder that Donnie coined the phrase “fake news,” he and his administration are the very embodiment of it. He is the snake oil salesman, the showman... His leadership abilities are about as fake as his real estate deals... Take a dog turd, and gild it in gold.

Nearly a fifth of the oil trade, or nearly 19 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil, passes through the Strait of Hormuz, yes pipelines capable to ship oil outside of the Persian Gulf, but operating way below capacity.
1525 2018-07-30 20:18:53 That oil is enough to change the engine oil of your car. Be thankful they sold it cheap

1536 2018-07-30 20:17:57 Hey @matthewmercer, what are the stats you use for holy oil? I can't find anything online, and it's quite the backlog to sort through to find it!
1537 2018-07-30 20:17:44 War reparations in Weimar--debts in other currencies/gold : Venezuela pegged to petro-dollar, debts in $; black market, drought, imports everything, one export oil.....could go on.  Economies in extremis.

1542 2018-07-30 20:17:12 A guy at my work has a sticker on his toolbox that says “Radial engines don’t leak oil, they’re just marking their territory!” And I find it funny every time I see it, probably way more than I should

1558 2018-07-30 20:14:49 On their side. Laughable. No nation is on their side. The PLO and Hamas have exhausted even their Arab brethren. Much easier for Europe and the oil producing Arab states to throw them some money than in corporate them into their own societies. Besides let Israel do "babysitting."

1562 2018-07-30 20:13:45 I can’t stand grease like I’m the type of person to towel down my bacon and eggs just cuz that oil is nasty
1563 2018-07-30 20:13:31 Yeah it's at least worth a go, and see if your body works well with it. Just gotta be prepared for that slight excess oil production in the first week haha. But after then it's usually good
1564 2018-07-30 20:13:15 1)CONDITION 
you only need to shampoo once or twice a week but conditioner is your best friend, it shafts and seals your hair folicles

2)apply a mask
once a week mix coconut and jojoba oil (equal) and massage it through your hair then shampoo and condition it.

Just do an exorcism at once.
1672 2018-07-30 20:01:32 Oil paint on a canvas? This is so random & so sweet of you. I’ve got no time thoughts, really don’t mind if you can’t do it for months! Always wanted one of my little girl. Just saw your efforts today and loved it. My students always laugh at my art efforts 
1673 2018-07-30 20:01:32 I bought a small bottle of coconut oil to spray on my hair for frizz, which didn't help, but it's definitely helping my hair grow and get thicker?¿ also my hair smells v good
1674 2018-07-30 20:01:23 Loved @BegumNadiya's programme tonight. I want to make pasta! Can the avocado sauce work with olive oil and not coconut?? (I don't like coconuts)
1675 2018-07-30 20:01:02 Avoid cooking with #butter or #vegetable oil. Use healthier versions like olive, canola, or sunflower oil. #healthy #letsgetfit
1676 2018-07-30 20:00:48 There’s coconut oil all over my bathroom floor cause my dog decided to knock it over and eat it

1682 2018-07-30 20:00:14 Not seeing it...very stringy...looks very unmanageable... definitely needs a V05 hot oil treatment and deadends cut... however I do see potential...
1683 2018-07-30 19:59:56 I LOVE CASTOR OIL SOOOOO MUCH! #blackhair
1684 2018-07-30 19:59:49 ぽふろ入るか…と思ったんだけど4時間後テストなんよな
1685 2018-07-30 19:59:42 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What can we do about the rise in the barrel of oil.Iran is threatening shipment and rebels out of Yemen are causing issues.Can you get the Saudis to increase oil production?
1686 2018-07-30 19:59:33 Coats in great nick Ted.
Olive oil in its feed ? Looks great
1687 2018-07-30 19:59:14 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1688 2018-07-30 19:59:08 Also I know peppermint oil is good for regular headaches (I was really into aromatherapy when I was in high school) dunno about migraines though. My other solution to when the body is a butt is drink lots of water because the body needs lots of water and hydration is important!
1689 2018-07-30 19:59:05 Cod liver oil on the other hand... nothing redeems cod liver oil. I've met fishers in norway who swear on just drinking it by the ladle and noooooooooo
1690 2018-07-30 19:58:50 OILとか塗りたくないなと
思うんだけど、
日本、湿潤やしな。
護
1691 2018-07-30 19:58:39 Don't say that, haven't you seen folks go into shops to buy anointing oil? Use olive oil as salad dressing and watch them cringe
1692 2018-07-30 19:58:33 It’s addiction. All the way down to the cookie jar. Sugar, salt and oil are as addictive as heroin and the standard American diet will feed you all three every five minutes. #WholeFoodPlantBased eating will save your life 
1693 2018-07-30 19:58:25 Oil change.
1694 2018-07-30 19:58:15 I swear I become the most impatient person in the world waiting for my cars oil to be changed 
1695 2018-07-30 19:56:44 I guess the 7 information RNS's published in July so far are simply not enough for some folks! 
Some 'Cocks' seem to want RNS's every other day
Quality not quantity imo.
#UKOG #horsehill 
.. and to oil keeps on flowing 
Keep calm and carry on!
1696 2018-07-30 19:56:38 Iran’s and Houthis’ threats are real, if they get lucky to bomb one of those oil ships, we’ll face an environmental crisis + it’ll effect the oil international trade.
1697 2018-07-30 19:56:38 Save the oil for sardines!
1698 2018-07-30 19:56:32 1/2 packed, oil changed, beer run Wednesday morning for something new. Getting excited.
1699 2018-07-30 19:56:32 It’s a 10 or Moroccan Oil! I switch between these two brands!
1700 2018-07-30 19:56:12 don't know how i got lemongrass oil in my mouth but it's here to stay
1701 2018-07-30 19:56:07 So I had black coffee blended with coconut oil for the first time this morning. Did not eat anything Amazing taste and energy levels. I don't think I will ever drink it normal again. Plus, did not feel any energy lack or hunger until lunchtime.
1702 2018-07-30 19:56:03 every now and then can you massage my scalp w/ some castor oil.
1703 2018-07-30 19:55:47 Is there anyone on the fucking planet that actually likes truffle oil?
1704 2018-07-30 19:55:45 why when there is no climate change.They have been proven wrong by top weather experts.Big oil should worry about keeping the prices down instead if record profits.
1705 2018-07-30 19:55:37 she talked to me for a little more than an hour while we were getting used to eachother and she was getting my frame set.  shes awesome?  

im going to start taking classes by the next week on oil painting...  im happy
1706 2018-07-30 19:55:37 @AJStream Imran Khan is a government employee. Unrealistic to expect that training will happen at the same time? Guyanese be warned. All oil companies are there for profit not for help.  #Guyana #TheStream
1707 2018-07-30 19:55:16 Shampoo strips your hair of its natural oils which encourages it to overproduce oil, which is why it looks greasy after a day or two without shampoo. But if you cut out shampoo entirely then after a week or so your hair will naturally return to a healthy level of oil production
1708 2018-07-30 19:55:16 How of y’all use or have used the sugar and baby oil method
1709 2018-07-30 19:55:15 Primrose oil put me right into labor!

1711 2018-07-30 19:54:49 #AlexandriaOcasioCortez lack of maturity and wisdom very problematic. Just ask Canadians about #trudeau and his focus on legalizing marijuana and destroying oil industry and trade
1712 2018-07-30 19:54:48 I clean my face with face wipes everyday after taking my bath, immediately apply oil (I use vitamin E moisturizing skin oil, but you can use any body oil of your choice) and massage through my face, drinking a lot of water, being single, happy and enjoying God’s blessings 
1713 2018-07-30 19:54:30 Where do you get that pepperoni that Italian restaurants do? Where it forms little cups full of oil?
1714 2018-07-30 19:54:26 Try...
- get water under the plate
- (olive? / canola spray?) oil the rim of the plate where it touches the pan
- attach a suction mount to plate
- protect hands (long gloves?)
- heat water to steam, apply pressure SIDEWAYS on the mount, don’t lift (this creates suction)

1717 2018-07-30 19:54:07 Quinn lol I have a question ab changing the oil in my car 
1718 2018-07-30 19:54:03 McDonald's fries were better before they went to healthy oil.
1719 2018-07-30 19:53:58 GEJ sold more oil than any other president in history and left nothing in our reserve!
1720 2018-07-30 19:53:55 I would imagine what would be different is we had been bought out by rich oil magnate 
1721 2018-07-30 19:53:51 If I accidentally hammer a chicken breast while making dinner, my wife will tell me that I'm chopped and I'll be going home. I in turn threaten to get out the truffle oil.
1722 2018-07-30 19:53:51 Just met a supervisor for a different oil field company at Applebee’s. We had a couple beers together and got along pretty well. He just offered me double my salary. Life can’t get any better. Pray to God this is real.
1723 2018-07-30 19:53:50 The west are complexit because  they enjoy the oil and gas in Biafra land so if they tell the Nigeria government to check it they loss
1724 2018-07-30 19:53:49 Even with SWIFT running int'l banks won't handle oil payments to Iran. SWIFT is just a facilitatory organisation.
Oil payments transactions can only be processed through large banks with high capital levels and such banks' operations & assets are vastly exposed to the US market.
1725 2018-07-30 19:53:38 Serbian freedom fighters, against the Islamist backed head choppers in Bosnia.  Too bad the Eurocucks sided against Serbia.  Oil.
1726 2018-07-30 19:53:31 They are keeping an eye and on alert quite clearly then.
1727 2018-07-30 19:53:29 Recruiters have all been utter jokers and snake oil salesmen in my experience. Unfair no doubt but there we are.
1728 2018-07-30 19:53:27 again fake news trump is only manupilating oil prices he is a big lair @Normsmusic
1729 2018-07-30 19:53:14 Raw garlic just like burns a lot its not fun, it's the second time I did something disgusting for health reasons cos he did it the first 5ike was cod liver oil

1731 2018-07-30 19:52:50 I’m the former Venezuelan oil minister. Exxon Mobil is exploring and drilling oil in an Offshore area that is under dispute between Guayana and Venezuela. It’s ilegal. Exxon Mobil forces Guyana to accept a very bad contract. In my country, Exxon Mobil has a bad record! @AJStream
1732 2018-07-30 19:52:46 You know, no matter how articulate your English is, castor oil will always sound wrong.
1733 2018-07-30 19:52:21 I'm terrible in the kitchen, I freak out when I can hear the oil spitting even without my hearing aid.
1734 2018-07-30 19:52:11 The people of Guyana should learn from Nigeria where the discovery of oil has stymied innovation and entrenched perversive corruption. They need a futuristic policy framework that sees beyond the oil. Leadership is key
1735 2018-07-30 19:52:08 @AJstream Guyana is wholly unprepared for oil.Where is the revenue management plan? How do we avoid the resource curse? What about political stability?
1736 2018-07-30 19:52:05 Tis the season. Ive actually been using bug spray from walmart and mixed cedar oil in it and have been spraying the ouside of the house and had not seen one in months and i live in san tan by all the grow fields so lots of those little bastards everywhere lol
1737 2018-07-30 19:51:30 getting an oil change and they keep asking me if things are working and I just keep saying no bc my car sucks

1739 2018-07-30 19:51:18 agreed...
Pollution is a REAL concern but why limit it to straws?
Yeah straws pollute but so do cups, exhaust fumes, cigarette butts, fertilizers, toxic dumping, clothing dyes, concrete plants, nuclear power plants, furniture factories, Oil Spills, Gen X in water, Lead, Syringes
1740 2018-07-30 19:51:15 There’s lots of different ways to make it. Look on Pinterest  Zinc is great to use or coconut oil with baking powder. It’s all up to what works for you!
1741 2018-07-30 19:51:13 @AJStream no oil company comes to save any country. We are suffering them in Nigeria.
1742 2018-07-30 19:51:07 today some chick called 112 because she couldn't remove her lashes. thankfully the ambulance wasn't needed, the dispatcher told her to use some baby oil
1743 2018-07-30 19:50:38 Border towns, and anywhere where it's only oil and ranches
1744 2018-07-30 19:50:36 The oil on your head won't run dry.

1746 2018-07-30 19:50:05 ND are not fighting for oil. it’s an excuse

BH are not fighting for Islam. it’s a front

farmer/herdsman/religious/tribal clashes too have nothing to do with improving society nor do they care about good governance

they’re criminals with sophisticated weapons & no sense. #evil
1747 2018-07-30 19:50:02 What do you do when you're guilty of treason, high crimes and misdemeanors? 

Create a Religious Liberty Task Force so White Evangelicals will support a corrupt traitor & vote Republicans #Midterms.

Well 70% of the country isn't buying your snake oil. GTFOH.
1748 2018-07-30 19:49:56 just a tip: brushing your teeth 2-3 times a day with coconut oil after you brush your teeth whitens them.
1749 2018-07-30 19:49:54 MAKE CLEANING SPRAY WITH ESSENTIAL OIL/S AND WATER AND RUBBING ALCOHOL AND VINEGAR. I GOT THE SPRAY BOTTLE FROM DOLLAR TREE! 
I READ YOU CAN PUT IN BAKING SODA TO MAKE A FABRIC SPRAY.
1750 2018-07-30 19:49:45 I agree but it’s still a valid point re the military. That being said, industrial ag encompasses the military point since imperialism is used to secure resources often used in industrial ag, such as oil, etc.
1751 2018-07-30 19:49:43 There was no need for Ford or any other manufacturer to get into the oil business to expand the ICE car market.
1752 2018-07-30 19:49:39 That like washing spoiled milk taste out of your mouth with cod liver oil.
1753 2018-07-30 19:49:30 He is a bit of a mesmerizer is he not? Best snake oil salesman in history.
1754 2018-07-30 19:49:28 You know when you get uncomfortably hot feet in bed this time of year? Try soaking a cotton pad in water or toner and adding 1-2 drops of peppermint oil and wipe all over your footsies.  Wait ten mins and bam. Cold feet.
1755 2018-07-30 19:49:26 And probably leak a few times too. But who was ever hurt by hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil leaking into rivers and streams, right?
1756 2018-07-30 19:49:25 At some point we will be able to recycle the batteries correct, thus not needing to Mine as much instead of the endless Oil consumption. Not Trolling just trying to Educate myself.
1757 2018-07-30 19:49:19 You had a great idea about fuel labelling, go farther, be bolder. 

Why not impose tariffs on foreign oil imported into Canada to deter their use which might “wake up” consumers in certain parts of the country. Feel the pain being felt in ROC as a result of buying that oil
1758 2018-07-30 19:49:14 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?

1764 2018-07-30 19:48:34 Again our lives is on a bid!!! Again Iran is for sale!!! Till oil exists it would be the same! Obama , trump , qazzafi ... till we stupids exist
1765 2018-07-30 19:48:21 Instead of banning oil development, start funding to find a better way to construct pipelines so that they can be built without affecting the environment. Do some privately funded research and development. Instead of banning necessary development, do something to actually help.
1766 2018-07-30 19:48:20 The resource curse is not a matter of good or bad intentions, but the nature of the oil business a small number of foreign contractors can run the whole oil business, the populace labour power has no ability to demand a cut of oil revenues short of revolt.
1767 2018-07-30 19:48:07 There's a dude at the gym who smells like olive oil and oregano and I don't know if it's just because I haven't had pizza in months but I definitely wanna fuck this dude. #keto
1768 2018-07-30 19:48:06 CHN  earned the respect of the West: in relatively a few years they rose from third world economy to global superpower, now competing with the West in the neo-colonization of Africa. Recently they began trading oil in their local Yuan Instead of the dollar 

Africa..
1769 2018-07-30 19:47:53 Elizabeth If Forest fires are net carbon source, why not stop BC raping Millions Acres of Air Cleaning Forests for USA Lumber?

How bout all those Alaska Oil Tankers in BC waters?
1770 2018-07-30 19:47:44 Don’t even bother it will just ruin Guyana and allow oil companies to seize the opportunity to make money and continue our dependence on fossil fuels . Not worth it

1790 2018-07-30 19:45:24 No, it's just oversupply due to oil sands and so on. Companies are reducing oil sands investments. China reportedly isn't into it. Time to move on, the free market already has.

1801 2018-07-30 19:43:46 @AJStream 
The Guyanese government should use profits and/or tax revenue to invest in infrastructure. Use the recent oil discovery as a stepping stone rather than an answer to Guyana's development

1804 2018-07-30 19:43:33 YOU ARE USING $2BN TO BUILD A NEW REFINERY IN KATSINA THAT DOESNT PRODUCE OIL WHY NOT REVAMP OR BUILD IT TH THE REGION THAT PRODUCES IT?
1805 2018-07-30 19:43:09 If I’ve said it once I’ve said it a million times: COCONUT OIL SAVES LIVES

1807 2018-07-30 19:43:01 What I personally think the best way to gauge the possible timing of the upcoming economic collapse other than oil, I probably don't know what I'm talking about, but ill give it a go.  Simply take the total amount in $'ers, of consumer debt, be it cc's, mortgages, school loans,

1811 2018-07-30 19:42:30 As for fossil fuel jobs, there are plenty of opportunities to be had in more Earth friendly forms of energy. The blame is placed on those who refuse to divest from "Big Oil" while those companies have a lobbying stronghold in DC. #msnbc
1812 2018-07-30 19:42:18 If I do keep my faith in God after going through this faith crisis I am in, it will, in part, be because of how much I love olive oil. I have nothing left to say about that.
1813 2018-07-30 19:42:13 Bio Oil makes my face feel like actual joy itself.
1814 2018-07-30 19:41:51 Buy your best local brand is my recommendation. I’m allergic to peanuts and have had 3 reactions from Italian olive oil. It’s all contaminated and diluted with cheap oils. I think the peanut oil is to bring up the colour.

1816 2018-07-30 19:41:30 What makes it not? Have you seen the crappy trend? It's not our place to tell Google how to invest their funds or how much to invest in Nigeria. It's not oil revenue ffs

1822 2018-07-30 19:40:31 I meant oil revenues to government not overall size of the Nigerian oil trade.
1823 2018-07-30 19:40:22 @AJStream going by the experience of many oil exporting nations in Africa, oil has caused more damage than good. It would take enormous determination for Guyana to succeed with oil #ajstream
1824 2018-07-30 19:40:17 Zinke is, however, protecting Montana's Upper Missouri River Breaks monument and creating another, the Badger-Two Medicine, just miles from his childhood home.  Zinke also halted gas and oil lease sales near Yellowstone and opposed gold mining in that area.  Good for Montana.
1825 2018-07-30 19:40:16 Cocoa- Ghana, Cote d'Ivorie
Oil- Nigeria, Angola just to state a few..
Yet, the countries that own these raw materials get only 3-8% of the total value derived form them.

1834 2018-07-30 19:39:24 I think Oil contributes about 9% to Nigeria's GDP. That's about $40b annually. 

I get your gist though.
1835 2018-07-30 19:39:23 I hate coming to get oil changes no bruh I don’t need all y’all extra stuff I got a cousin who can do it for a Black and a Bud light

1837 2018-07-30 19:39:15 Because you seem to want to always deny that you are a oil money club. Or suggest other things but the cash. If Arsenal had been invested in like City I would not care less. Most other teams are just jealous they would take it in a heart beat.
1838 2018-07-30 19:39:08 What bullshit. This will only appeal to desperate people who don’t give a shit about their children’s future. Oh and to the oil industry. Oh and the banks that prop it up.
1839 2018-07-30 19:39:05 Anybody know if ‘Oil Of Every Pearl’s Un-insides’ by @SOPHIEMSMSMSM will get a physical release?
1840 2018-07-30 19:38:38 i haven't used extra virgin olive oil since college. 

High school was rough, man.

So you've made a rather ignorant comment

1847 2018-07-30 19:37:47 The Oil or petroleum industry, is their major focus. They have several Parastatles like NILPET, GPOC and DPOC. Hopefully, a time will come when the service sector will be as important.
1848 2018-07-30 19:37:46 What is "tuna water"? There's no water in my tuna, only extra virgin olive oil.

1855 2018-07-30 19:37:29 It's not a favourite, but it works: olbas oil in bowl of boiling water. Put your head right over the bowl, towel over your head for several minutes. Do it 3 or 4 times daily. Absolutely 'orrible, but it soon shifts catarrh, coughs, phlegm, et cetera.
1856 2018-07-30 19:37:04 Mayonnaise is emulsified eggs and oil. Hollandaise is emulsified eggs and butter (and lemon). Yet somehow mayonnaise is significantly more disgusting a product than hollandaise.

1866 2018-07-30 19:35:31 That’s what I believed when I voted for him. Even if the media is hysterical, after a while I couldn’t ignore the corruption. Golfing for profit at his own resorts.

1867 2018-07-30 19:35:22 Solar panels take up quite a lot of land too. Are you against those? I guess so. By the way, palm oil is used to make diesel, not petrol. Also note that most palm is grown for food rather than fuel.

1943 2018-07-30 19:25:19 Telling white people that we've been forgotten or marginalized. What a crock!!! 35% of my fellow Americans have been fooled by a snake oil sales man.
1944 2018-07-30 19:25:19 Vitamin E oil. 
Aloe Vera gel. 

1945 2018-07-30 19:24:50 I hate not going to the dealership to get my oil changed now bc they ask me too many damn questions at Walmart. I don't know any of the things they are saying to me, pls just change my oil and I will give you money I AM SCARED.
1946 2018-07-30 19:24:37 هي في انواع بتتاكل قشرتها بس مش كله 
1947 2018-07-30 19:24:25 It is lol I can't ever brush it... otherwise it turns into a puffy mess and ruins all the nice curls. I wash it, put oil in it, and let it go wild haha
1948 2018-07-30 19:24:13 So tired of your BS. Not for us middle classes. Any extra few dollars I am bringing home is paying for my gasoline which is over 3.00 a gallon from your country that has more oil than it knows what to do with. #greed #liar #onthetake #nralover #gunlover
1949 2018-07-30 19:24:13 Someone with 50 million barrels of oil must come buy Kaizer Chiefs.

1951 2018-07-30 19:23:54 So would you rather the higher risk of trucks and trains hauling and spilling oil and gas? It’s a safer alternative although I see your concern. But be more informed about it. I’m a big fan btw don’t get me wrong
1952 2018-07-30 19:23:44 They don't look like oil paintings, either. I'm pretty sure it's a filter in Photoshop that has been run over some photographs.
1953 2018-07-30 19:23:43 It’s the natural glow sis. Jk I put organic coconut oil on my face every night

1956 2018-07-30 19:23:37 I can't help for your utter ignorance. You can't help yourself. People with low caliber just believe the absurd. Obama had that snake oil Charlton way of bamboozling people who would believe anything even it it was obviously not true. Gullible
1957 2018-07-30 19:23:33 Don't hurt the piano helllooooo commander Where do things you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
1958 2018-07-30 19:23:21 they love the principles of capitalism, right up until they need special favors and bailouts. The entire oil industry is propped up by tax dollars. Does no one remember 2008? If they are seriously about capitalism, they should let businesses fail as they should.
1959 2018-07-30 19:23:19 Yes that would be wonderful -   Kim is a little different to all - but seriously the oil factor is the big difference (meaning more interested bystanders)
1960 2018-07-30 19:23:19 Not the whole country...only ALASKA and we will have to PAY for them to take it off of our hands, seeings how we got it all dirty with oil pipelines and such!
1961 2018-07-30 19:23:01 Hey @ZoellaBeauty I was wondering, what happened to the good glistener shower oil? My local Superdrug store never had it (btw they still don’t stock splash ) and I can’t find it online. Was that just a Short period limited edition ? 
1962 2018-07-30 19:22:40 How is regular coconut oil that you apply to your head different than beard oil which is only for your beard?
1963 2018-07-30 19:22:39 وانت ونيتك بقي صفي النيه 
1964 2018-07-30 19:22:38 Time to go long oil stocks. Rotation from tech is starting
1965 2018-07-30 19:22:18 You mean selling our public lands to the highest bidder for oil while we witness the effects of climate change in front of our eyes?
1966 2018-07-30 19:22:11 That’s why they retire in Spain because it’s too expensive to retire at home and the weather is crap.  That’s also why they move to the US because they do better here. Also in addition to high taxes they are heavily subsidized by oil then wag their finger about climate change.
1967 2018-07-30 19:22:00 Oil just dey overflow for your head
1968 2018-07-30 19:22:00 انت فاهم المانجا غلط 
1969 2018-07-30 19:21:37 Not sure, but that could be. BTE has natgas exposure which is weak with gas pricing at the moment. Heavy oil also not getting as high of a price compared to light producers and not sure how the RRX merger will go. Still too many unknowns.
1970 2018-07-30 19:21:21 and providing gasoline through this existing delivery system was
relatively simple, at least initially. In 1906, Standard Oil
operated nearly 3573 bulk stations in the US."

1973 2018-07-30 19:21:08 Convince@Ukenyatta to allow the Japanese construct bridges in Mombasa instead of those cable cars which hang like bats. When there is power failure those cars will hang dangerously in the air with passengers trapped inside. Can that cable car manage to transport an oil tanker?
1974 2018-07-30 19:21:06 I hate when people try to give me skin care advice, that’s why ya face clogged up cause you believe coconut oil moisturizes your face.
1975 2018-07-30 19:21:06 I am so happy that so much benefit to our economy, and National Security has come to our Country since @POTUS has fulfilled his America First Policies, especially In the Energy Sector, creating for the 1st Time,the breaking of the 11MB/D of Crude Oil. Creating Prosperity for all!
1976 2018-07-30 19:21:02 Bit right up the road, in Baytown, there was a neighborhood that was on top of a aquifer and oil field that were both being pumped. They subsided 10 over a few decades.

Why didn't we save in the rainy days of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.. Mrs Yemi forgot to tell us Fashola and Amaechi took the FG to court to share all the money in the excess crude oil Account...we all have selective amnesia I guess
1981 2018-07-30 19:20:07 so why they coming for us? Also I remember the time that one of their fans ask chan oil if he read any fanfics lol they should asked themselves to behave
1982 2018-07-30 19:20:05 Once on the shit don’t move. It reminds me of a really expensive paint marker formula in a Japanese extremely fine felt tip pen except it dries down almost like an oil pastel if oil pastels dried down flat like acrylic Lololol. Its really hard to explain.
1983 2018-07-30 19:19:56 China went to Nicaragua promised to build the biggest canal ever built, nothing happened; went to Venezuela, gave them a lot of money but took their oil, Venezuela is falling apart; now is the turn for the Dominican Republic, they are offering a lot, but asking counter part,

1987 2018-07-30 19:19:45 I don’t remember the exact recipe but it’s like 1 cup of rice, 2 cups of water (we use a little olive oil but some people use a teaspoon of butter), about 5 mins on high, and then 15 mins on half power
1988 2018-07-30 19:19:37 There was this oil barron who went to the dentist and the dentist said, you don’t need any fillings, the oil barron said, drill anyway I feel lucky!
1989 2018-07-30 19:19:35 omg this flight is full of oil workers and managers returning from their two/three-week shifts and they’re all getting blasted on free drinks. The flight attendants know most of them so they’re just talking shit back and forth. It’s gonna be a wild flight. 
1990 2018-07-30 19:19:33 Yeah they tend to project with their  latest lie.   So he paid somehow.   Don’t know.   His share of oil deal?
1991 2018-07-30 19:19:33 I kinda stan my oil diffuser
1992 2018-07-30 19:19:22 Cabot Oil & Gas still in the doldrums despite Susquehanna upgrade
1993 2018-07-30 19:19:16 Oh yes it is, because of her mismanagement of the Biggest oil company(Sonangol) in the country where she was the CEO
1994 2018-07-30 19:19:13 Veggies: cucumber, cabbage, green peas, always fry with coconut oil its very low on calories

1996 2018-07-30 19:19:01 It sounds weird but have you tried fapping? It really works  also, lavender essential oil used to help with some of my milder ones.
1997 2018-07-30 19:19:00 If you’re frying bacon in coconut oil, for example, you’ll actually replace some of the fat in the bacon with fat from the coconut oil. You’ll still be getting good quality fat, but it’s a greater amount of the fat that’s recommended for active people. #BodyIO
1998 2018-07-30 19:18:57 Saved you a click: Saudi Arabia announced last week it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. CC: @SavedYouAClick
1999 2018-07-30 19:18:54 I have a ton of Black-owned products to re-up on this week:

It takes technical expertise to explore for oil.
It takes proven track record for building companies
It takes financial expertise to create and capture value for shareholders. 
They have all. Now thet just need cash. Which is coming

2007 2018-07-30 19:17:29 "Venezuela has less state and communal ownership than other social democracies"

they have 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, all owned by the state. used to have one of most efficient state oil companies in the world too, as well as a ton of refinery assets, all state owned.
2008 2018-07-30 19:17:25 I don’t feel like going to get my oil changed but I know I need to but I just don’t feel like moving at all.
2009 2018-07-30 19:17:21 I can’t look at a bottle of bio oil without thinking about the worst sex I’ve ever had

2021 2018-07-30 19:15:53 They had oil going up to $200 bbl ffs and demand increasing from 7600 GWh - 120000 GWh in 2067. Nalcor's demand was off by 30 years - 2008 average oil cost $91 ($103 in today')s dollars 2010 $71 ($80) yep they made a 57 year gamble on a 3 year price high

2023 2018-07-30 19:15:47 Your viewpoint on the history of nationalization in Guyana is interesting. Do you think the government could propose a private/public partnership with oil companies to try & benefit both the company & country? If not, what type of relationship should Guyana pursue with oil comp's
2024 2018-07-30 19:15:41 Shell UK, Agip of Italy & Total of France very soon all of you will be leaving Rep of Biafra in favour of US oil companies.

2025 2018-07-30 19:14:54 Do not use @Valvoline ever!!! I went for an oil change and they didn’t have a part they broke and used some sort of contraption and I ended up having to get a new oil pan and now valvoline will not even respond to my emails.  Don’t go there and don’t use them!! They rip you off!!

2036 2018-07-30 19:13:50 Oil cities, so very rare to find any cheap air fares. Competition is around the eastern cities. Eg: CPH-NYC can be had for less than £1000 return.
2037 2018-07-30 19:13:44 Another thought, pwhy not eliminate all subsidies for oil & other big business. the tax payers Are tired of subsidizing big business while they get huge tax breaks & obscene profits. 
Time to take care of “we the people” 

Eliminate all lobbyists money, too.

2050 2018-07-30 19:12:06 lol I was supposed to take my car for an oil change this morn (about 2 almost 3 mo overdue) but I was so tired I passed out instead whoops
2051 2018-07-30 19:12:04 of course:)
2052 2018-07-30 19:11:48 Ughhh. Sitting at a dealership for what feels like the longest slowest oil change in the history of oil changes.  Grrrrr. Hope they finish soon.
2053 2018-07-30 19:11:44 The Cap Metro knob-polishers are wrong. Houston ridership shot up quickly (it was a huge PR bonanza at first) and then fell down below previous baseline over a year or so later, oil/gas employment declines blamed etc etc.
2054 2018-07-30 19:11:33 Came for an oil change now I’m debating on getting my camaro back

2057 2018-07-30 19:11:24 Those having employer based insurance dont want it anymore? 
They would rather rely on government to decide?
That's what would happen if you get your way. 
Would be no reason for employers to offer it as an incentive or benefit any longer.

2068 2018-07-30 19:10:44 Canadian Oil and Gas continues to put out weak earnings mostly on hedging in Q2 and investors are abandoning ship, but they had no problem pumping them in Q2 on thin air. People realize we are in Q3 right? 
Let weak hands capitulate so we can go higher.
2069 2018-07-30 19:10:38 where can I mail her vitamins and fish oil?
2070 2018-07-30 19:10:27 I been using Bioré, witch hazel, & coconut oil...my face really clearing up.
2071 2018-07-30 19:10:23 tick size, value, volatility will be different....just another trading mechanism for crude.. like the ETF's, Brent, the indian, chinese, dubai contracts etc.. just CL for me for trading crude..the rest is all crap.:)
2072 2018-07-30 19:10:22 I think the only X-factor, bu-dum-tish, in this whole thing is how the "marvel public" would reconcile the existence of inhumans AND mutants.  Like, you just found out a few years ago that eating the wrong kind of fish oil could turn you into a monster and now THIS?!?

2078 2018-07-30 19:09:43 I have extremely sensitive skin so i have to stick with the basics when it comes to this kinda thing. Best recommendation is warm water and exfoliating towel for blemishes, then coconut oil or tea tree oil for dryskin
2079 2018-07-30 19:09:41 Yeltsin's gang is still in power. What they did in 2000s (when they were lucky with oil prices skyrocketing) is securing their own happy future and the future of their offspring. They have nothing to offer to the society.  Next? Rotting & degradation (already in progress).
2080 2018-07-30 19:09:22 How are oil and farm subsidies any different?
2081 2018-07-30 19:09:18 I think your analysis would be stronger it it also acknowledged that roughly 25% of Norway's GDP is in the oil industry.
2082 2018-07-30 19:09:17 Rieder had 25pts last year...
2083 2018-07-30 19:09:09 Yeah we had a problem with cabbage worms once the kale started to grow tall. Neem oil helped but now we have so many unharvested greens. I decided to pick some and cook them for (late) lunch
2084 2018-07-30 19:09:03 Spilled boiling oil on my hand  not fun...
2085 2018-07-30 19:08:54 I took a road trip for the weekend, came back in time for work, got an oil change, my tank is full and I’m still not broke. A little sleepy? Yes. But aren’t i always? Y’all gotta stop making excuses.
2086 2018-07-30 19:08:52 I'm so sick of that kid tariq. He makes my blood oil  #power
2087 2018-07-30 19:08:47 Isis had a lot of oil money intercepted by us... should we pay them back as well?
2088 2018-07-30 19:08:33 The #TheQueenMzansi weddings always end  in drama nje, I wonder who died  Shaka and Weddings =oil&water
2089 2018-07-30 19:08:33 it translates to oil
2090 2018-07-30 19:08:22 Use your obscene profits to clean up the oceans. All that plastic garbage is your fault. It's all made from the oil you extract and refine for massive profit.
2091 2018-07-30 19:08:02 كل واحد فينا جواه برعم صغير 
2092 2018-07-30 19:08:01 Oil packed is supposed to be the fancy kind??
2093 2018-07-30 19:07:47 I used to rub baby oil on my He- Man to make him more buff. Never been sure what to make of that
2094 2018-07-30 19:07:45 censo. carrnet de la patria y gasolina es un a farsa. el unico contrabando de extraccion lo hacen la gente del gobierno ellos son los contrabandistas se llevan millones de litros de gasolina y ahorra dicen que no hay y que deben controlar su venta interna.
2095 2018-07-30 19:07:34 the red sea is one of the few seas where there is such a high water ratio that shipping oil through it leads to whats called "immediate hydrogenation" leading to boats vanishing

2097 2018-07-30 19:07:12 A lot of people don’t realise that Trump needs to and is trying to avert a major conflict in the Middle East, in October when sanctions on Iran’s oil comes in the Straight of Hormuz will likely be shut, leading to a major conflict involving all middle eastern countries
2098 2018-07-30 19:07:10 Big oil and the US auto industry will do EVERYTHING to prevent this!
2099 2018-07-30 19:07:09 My hair has been so frazzled lately, I hope switching back to the coconut oil shampoo and conditioner helps. 
2100 2018-07-30 19:06:51 I understand the sacrifices our servicemen make, but they don’t do it to keep us safe. They do it to protect our oil interests , and because war is profitable. The sad thing is that most servicemen don’t know they’re being used.
2101 2018-07-30 19:06:43 My drunk ass lost two separate oil pens in two different Uber’s on two different occasions this month

2104 2018-07-30 19:06:26 It’s a shame the tasty and relatively healthy @HaloTopCreamery ice cream has Palm Oil as one of its ingredients. Won’t be buying that again unless things change for th better. #bemoresustainable #PalmOil #savetherainforest #savetheanimals @RAN

2107 2018-07-30 19:06:23 I go to the same guy for my oil change every time.... and without him even looking at my miles on my car he said “oh gosh what am I gonna do with you, you’re way overdue for an oil change”  he did my oil change for free. I love him. 
2108 2018-07-30 19:06:18 @joshjaxon See this pledge total? This is not the action of a fan base apathetic about their team. Dn’t fool yourslf or buy the snake oil PSV pushes jst so you can rationalize a hijack. If you support ripping CbusCrew from its home & fans, you can’t use the excuse it’s not wanted
2109 2018-07-30 19:06:06 Just got home from doing my oil change and alignment got the whip ready for the ride tomorrow night
2110 2018-07-30 19:06:02 Remember: When you look at what Trump and Pompeo are doing, Manafort's last job was to deliver Kirkuk oil and gas fields to Iran and Russia in 2017.  Putin wants the pressure off of Iran so his assets Trump and Pompeo are happy to oblige the boss. @FBIWFO

2116 2018-07-30 19:05:05 Coconut oil x bath time
2117 2018-07-30 19:04:55 Tons of oil!!
2118 2018-07-30 19:04:55 You care enough to continue this and throw more oil in the flame ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2119 2018-07-30 19:04:52 PUB tried to do their job and had their legs taken out from under them as a result, limiting the terms of reference for MF was a great disservice to NL - as for your salary to blame ratio snake oil salesman Ed Martin was getting paid $700K and was the professional face for Nalcor
2120 2018-07-30 19:04:32 How many people were employed by the oil sands. How many employed by major banks, We are talking abt employing ppl. Your last line makes zero sense.
2121 2018-07-30 19:04:28 Always seem to get oil all over my fingers, messy job
2122 2018-07-30 19:04:12 Olive oil is mostly monounsaturated, coconut oil is mostly saturated. Veggie oils are polyunsaturated and loaded with omega 6. Ungood (probably).
2123 2018-07-30 19:04:11 Certain things are unacceptable to some cultures. Usually lies are the most intolerant crime you can do to a culture. It always ends badly when the snake oil salesmen is caught adding olive oil to the jugs.
2124 2018-07-30 19:04:10 They going to erase this knowledge from the brains of those that have it and prevent anyone else from learning it?
2125 2018-07-30 19:03:51 Saudi provides oil so they can’t ban them you idiots. Obama banned the same countries, how is this a muslim ban now and it wasn’t before?
2126 2018-07-30 19:03:43 This is written by someone either politically motivated or is absolutely CLUELESS when it comes to CBD oil. Do you realize our daughter had to go through over 5 diff CBD combos etc to find the right dosage and mixture? It’s NOT a one stop shop. U all are the ones promoting fear.
2127 2018-07-30 19:03:43 I don’t use pasta— you roast butternut squash with salt pepper and oil, sautée sausage and spinach, top with Greek yogurt. You can add pasta if you want or like tomatoes. I guess it’s different than what you made but they’re similar!

2131 2018-07-30 19:03:07 NO “F”ing way! 
They should repeal the #GOPTaxScam instead and stop providing corporate welfare to commercial farmers and oil companies, etc.
2132 2018-07-30 19:03:07 Tincture is oil dissolved in alcohol to make it easier to use. Always go by the strength in mg of active compounds. 1 gram of oil could be weaker than 1ml of tincture if the oil is poor quality.

"Isolate" is 99%+ pure THC or CBD, usually in crystalized form.
2133 2018-07-30 19:03:05 Pass lmao. Not drinking motor oil
2134 2018-07-30 19:03:02 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over” (Psalm 23:5). #TrustGod

2139 2018-07-30 19:02:36 Yessir. Got some concentrate oil at 82.6% and stoked ETF at 74% I think too fook yeah
2140 2018-07-30 19:02:28 Your body is like a car...

Working out is like souping up your car by putting a better engine and more efficient energy usage. 

Mobility and massage are like oil changes and general maintenance. 

Nutrition is like gas. You can choose the highest quality or the lowest.
2141 2018-07-30 19:02:16 @MoSalah how's the shoulder Mo'?

!00% okay?   or not quite?   Because I got some Comfrey Oil for you.
2142 2018-07-30 19:02:09 "It's an oil issue" (actual excuse)
2143 2018-07-30 19:02:04 Italy just seriously kissing dons ass. From what I got... our next "war" could be Libya because Italy wants help 'stabelizing' there. Because... you know... oil.
2144 2018-07-30 19:02:03 Lmao you can have a diffuser but use a different oil...let me guess Lavender and Peppermint Oil?
2145 2018-07-30 19:01:56 It’s crazy to me that people with the opportunity never confront Koch shills about the fact that the Koch brother’s are heirs of a fortune that came from their father building oil refineries for Hitler and Stalin.
2146 2018-07-30 19:01:56 you can use any base oil you want! hope it helps bby
2147 2018-07-30 19:01:25 now we’re cooking with peanut oil

2149 2018-07-30 19:01:13 Sumanth was an exceptional research scientist. With the added complexity of being a remote employee, he integrated himself into the team and utilized his extensive knowledge in rheology and oil sands background to bring innovative solutions to our group.
2150 2018-07-30 19:01:03 crude oil never sold @ $150 per barrel,  official exchange rate differential of =N= 180 per $ between 2014 and now so no basis for comparison.
2151 2018-07-30 19:00:51 i've tried this oil at a lot of different dosages and honestly i just don't think it's for me
2152 2018-07-30 19:00:33 The owner’s manual of your car will tell you to use a specific motor oil, 10W-30 or some shit, but here’s the kicker; it’s a total load of crap. Smoke a bowl, drink a soda, and just spit right in the oil cap and you’re good for 100,000 miles

2155 2018-07-30 19:00:20 God is giving you an ornament (a garland or diadem) of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the garment [expressive] of praise instead of a heavy, burdened, and failing spirit! I decree it over you in Jesus name. Type YES if you agree!
2156 2018-07-30 18:59:50 @JustinTrudeau please ban oil and gas activities in marine protected areas. It would really mean a lot.
2157 2018-07-30 18:59:43 wowwwww that sounds amazing minus the sweet almond oil cause i’ll die but it’s lit! thank you!
2158 2018-07-30 18:59:41 Wow! That is quite the collection! We have some serious oil envy over here! Thank you so much for sharing!

2161 2018-07-30 18:59:24 Dont think we watch Easterners more River City folk  Scotland may choose its own currency we have several options. We are wealthy without oil that's the icing on the cake,   a bonus.
2162 2018-07-30 18:59:11 oil....
2163 2018-07-30 18:59:03 Me too... At night I love taking a bubble bath with lavender Epsom salt and lavender body wash then defusing lavender essential oil
2164 2018-07-30 18:58:58 I'm also bullish on oil, and I think it's a better merger if you're more bullish on oil.
2165 2018-07-30 18:58:50 Lavender & Ylang Ylang oil = Hope
2166 2018-07-30 18:58:49 Hi @CascadianGuy. Thank you for the kind words! Our tocopherols are extracted from sunflower oil derived from non-GMO and organic sunflowers from Spain and are distributed to us by Food Ingredient Solutions in the USA. You can find the full story of where our (1/2)
2167 2018-07-30 18:58:48 Olive oil, wine, cheese.
2168 2018-07-30 18:58:47 Leave in conditioner + coconut oil. Heavier than argan oil so it keeps the strands together and cool water. Warm water will make curly hair more frizzy.
2169 2018-07-30 18:58:43 I just wanna be somewhere in the sand, near some water that stretches as far as my eyes can see, baby oil’d down, cheeks out, with the sun glistening off of me 
2170 2018-07-30 18:58:40 Bought a cheapo popcorn maker from amazon because I was fed up of using pans and burning myself with the oil spitting everywhere and it’s the best thing ever! Good thing is that it’s much healthier as it’s air popper rather than with oil  #goalz
2171 2018-07-30 18:58:28 Ok.. so if I drink olive oil, I'm making vinaigrette in my stomach. 

Gotcha 
2172 2018-07-30 18:58:22 Just @ me next time (Totally joking). I’m the one guilty today. Maybe it’s because I’m headed out for camp Wednesday it’s on my mind. However it made getting my oil change/inspection appointment go by a lot quicker this am...
2173 2018-07-30 18:58:13 A protip for you: Tea Tree Oi, Peppermint Oil, a dash of dish soap, diluted with water in a glass spray bottle. Spray that everywhere spiders, and most insects, can't stand the smell. You'll have to spray it once every month.
2174 2018-07-30 18:58:08 Clove oil for tooth 
2175 2018-07-30 18:58:06 Hi dear. Your DMs aren't open so I'll leave this here.

I'm interested in buying these: 
50ml Perfume R50; 
250ml Body Lotion R25 *2 (R50)
100ml Tissue Oil R35
Roll on Price ??
2176 2018-07-30 18:57:59 5 yrs ago (2013) oil prices were going through the roof. What kind of economist are you?
2177 2018-07-30 18:57:48 I never know if I’m doing or saying the right things when I go to get my oil changed by myself.
2178 2018-07-30 18:57:26 Whenever someone has an issue I’m like lavender oil girrrrlllll.                Tired? Lavender. Breakout? Lavender. Bug bites or bee stings? Lavender. It really is amazing!!

We’re not worthy tbh
2181 2018-07-30 18:57:08 forever smelling like weed and that oil she likes 
2182 2018-07-30 18:56:34 Tea tree oil **
2183 2018-07-30 18:56:24 I just lost a full gram of oil on the bus, but honestly I’m chilling! I take it as a sign that I should take a break. Weird thing is I told myself I need to last night, and then boom, I loose it this morning.  sign or naw? Haha
2184 2018-07-30 18:56:16 Turkey? Are you ready for it?
This is so despite Iran have their oil. You don't have it. You just have Erdogun fanatics who aren't worth anything.
2185 2018-07-30 18:55:56 The oil industry was concentrated and the car industry was fragmented?
2186 2018-07-30 18:55:55 Castor oil!!
2187 2018-07-30 18:55:51 I don't think so. I think oil is thick and sticky, while tincture is fluid. Oil would be stronger. And tincture you could 'water down' to different degrees. But that's just off the top of my head. And I'm not up on modern techniques.
2188 2018-07-30 18:55:36 And all that adorable grooming they do seals that miracle-hair with an oil that makes their coat impermeable to water.
2189 2018-07-30 18:55:26 Throw everything CANTU in the trash ..(unless it works for you). . Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus (shampoo, conditioner & everything else under that name) works amazingly for me and my curls. Also Miss Jessies Leave In Condish in a spray bottle mixed with water and tee tree oil

2191 2018-07-30 18:54:41 lamictal, abilify, celexa, naltrexone and a fish oil supplement.
2192 2018-07-30 18:54:34 Upside down logic is using crude oil earning without a corresponding use of funds as performance measurement.
2193 2018-07-30 18:54:32 Can’t believe I just paid that much for an oil change 
2194 2018-07-30 18:54:27 If you want to make your own salad dressing just get olive oil, lime juice and salt n pepper. The ultimate, whew.
2195 2018-07-30 18:54:24 I take my bath time very seriously.

2200 2018-07-30 18:53:42 The fell is crowned in copper
With a hint of green;
The sunbeams shade the hillside
Oh rapturous happy dream.

The peaks line up to see it
They queue and take a look
Looking down from on high at
This overflowing cup.

Breathlessly a story's told
An oil painting to behold.

2202 2018-07-30 18:53:24 Sell oil?

Why r u so disrespectful to ur veggie / vegan customers?! Really disgusted this is the case esp when other companies are extending their ranges 
2207 2018-07-30 18:52:44 I am all for the stimulus caused by the economic investments by the chem companies.  I too, work in a local oil refinery.  Just hope state and local governments become more proactive in solving the infrastructure deficiencies.
2208 2018-07-30 18:52:30 That nobody saw jail time over that is a travesty.

2211 2018-07-30 18:52:15 Making magnetic generators readily available at a fair price to the public would absolutely slash the world' domestic reliance on nuclear energy, oil and gas. No public administration would do this of course. But, the technology, designs and components are available now for DIY.
2212 2018-07-30 18:52:14 It’s that time of the year when I need a lil boo. I need my inspection done, oil change and some gas 
2213 2018-07-30 18:52:12 I can just picture the press conference:

#Trump:"Rouhnai is a tremendous leader of the proud #Iranian state, just great, not only that, #Iranian oil taste like honey, really, it's beautiful"
#Rouhani: "Feck off #Trump, you Gobshite"

#Putin will still be laughing his hole off.
2214 2018-07-30 18:52:10 Then why do you fucking people stick your nose and religion into other people's private business you fucking snake oil salesmen
2215 2018-07-30 18:52:10 Made a lavender bath bomb bubble bath this morning  after have some morning hazelnut creme  went back to bed and woke up and did a hot oil hair treatment with avocado  olive & almond oil  now doing a clay coconut mask  and a mint sugar scrub on my lips 
2216 2018-07-30 18:51:57 Listening to economic analyst is exactly what the Americans did, when they built the thousands of miles of pipe exported their oil and built up their LNG... Now Canada is left in the dust and USA has the next 20 years to enjoy the fruits of their Intelligent Decisions
2217 2018-07-30 18:51:54 Bio oil!!!
2218 2018-07-30 18:51:46 @Thom_Hartmann  so, Trump is going to crash the economy because that's what Putin wants. Trump and Putin want oil to sky rocket, its how they make money.  House foreclosures is how banks make their money...selling real estate for pennies on the dollar.   Period.

2220 2018-07-30 18:51:38 mmm that sounds good! for the dressing, i actually made a mixture of balsamic vinegar and honey mustard with a little olive oil :)
2221 2018-07-30 18:51:33 周りに人がいっぱいいたので、何か手を出された時に助けて貰えなくても目撃者には困らないかなと思って戦いました！

手を出されたらその慰謝料で顔面整形しようと思います！笑
2222 2018-07-30 18:51:32 The overwhelming consensus by scientists in the 1970s was we would be out of oil by 2000. Remember the lineups at the pumps? It was as big a “crisis” as Y2K. Lol! 
Science doesn’t run on consensus but constant questioning and actual proof, not flawed computer models.
2223 2018-07-30 18:51:32 We don't need nuclear if we get all of the oil, gas, and coal out of the ground, which by the way is what we're working to do right now. So sure, under current conditions, it's not necessary. But that's why I said I don't have to buy into your climate crisis to engage.
2224 2018-07-30 18:51:24 I was listening to Midnight Oil earlier today and it struck me how far we have come from a place where we as white citizens of the world stared our history of cruelty and inhumanity squarely in the face and vowed to do better.

2227 2018-07-30 18:51:14 What is CBD oil? Sounds like I need some
2228 2018-07-30 18:51:12 Hm...well it would be interesting to see oil refineries, chemical plants etc. set up that way, when just letting an average person get at it.

Because why first invest and build, and then hand it over...
2229 2018-07-30 18:51:04 Slutty Marluxia just uses cheap-ass perfume instead of high quality rose oil
2230 2018-07-30 18:50:51 AND lead us TOWARD equality for ALL, clear separation of church and state, massive budget increases in education & the arts nation-wide, sensible gun laws, better vetting of law enforcement  & a green economy that serves the nation and cripples the oil industry. #DIVESTNOW
2231 2018-07-30 18:50:51 Why are Oil company profits a bad thing?  They go straight back to shareholders and the economy, there is no Mr. Imperial Oil who pockets the 2 hundred million

2236 2018-07-30 18:49:50 I have to wait an hour for an oil change at Honda. Should have just scheduled an appointment instead of just coming up. Shouldn't have listened to Ericka.
2237 2018-07-30 18:49:49 We could not have realistically entered the war for Britain, nor would it have been wise to respond to Pearl Harbor even if it still happened.  (The Japanese Empire would've presumably had Russian oil and supplies helping fuel it and unoccupied friends ready to assist.)

2247 2018-07-30 18:47:59 Sorry for your sad news. If you haven't heard, you might want to try CBD oil for pets. It may ease her suffering. It's legal in most states and I do know of other pets who did better on it than on pharmaceuticals. May she have a peaceful time while she's still with you.

2260 2018-07-30 18:46:25 I see a clear strategy here-Trump wants to Drive certain countries out of the oil business and fill that void with Russian Crude-The by product will be great wealth for Trump family, more unrest in Middle East, and a weaker NATO-Russia offers nothing but oil, guns, and oppression

2264 2018-07-30 18:46:06 "Plus, I've got all this fur on so it's not like I can put the oil I got on myself.

It makes your skin shimmer like it was dusted by gold."
2265 2018-07-30 18:46:04 Gin and coconut oil cure that I’ve heard
2266 2018-07-30 18:45:44 I went to the hardware store looking for a food-grade wood sealer for some raised beds that are rotting a bit. They showed me the linseed oil, which has two choices: Raw and Boiled. Boiled dries faster. Ok chose that. Oh wait. it's full of heavy metals and is carcinogenic. Fck!
2267 2018-07-30 18:45:37 Jim, you remind me of my own stubborn refusal to mind the data. The data said my tires were worn; but I drove on until I got a flat. I ignored the transmission oil level data until my car caught fire. True stories. Ignore the data and it'll cost you/others.
2268 2018-07-30 18:45:22 I'm not really wanting to shame these individuals, but it's symptomatic of a deep denial in Norwegian society. Norway is one of the few european countries to barely have cut emissions for decades, and is on course for even more oil extraction
2269 2018-07-30 18:45:07 You know, it’s one of GOD’S small miracles! I have a hard one on my hands. He’s a Dobi, about 55 odd, 9 months old, beautiful and goofy friend. But he has seizures worse than one smaller terriers, he’s on 40 mg of phenobarbital, 3(times a day), and some CBD OIL when he paces.

2273 2018-07-30 18:44:38 How are utility tokens different from, say, oil? For discussion. 

We use oil/gas to travel, cook, stay warm, etc. It is a utility. 

The prices shift day-by-day, months and is traded globally.
2274 2018-07-30 18:44:35 Breaking (2:44 PM EDT): US crude rises 2.1%, settling at $70.13, boosted by signs of tight oil supply -- CNBC
2275 2018-07-30 18:44:22 Have fun paying 100 fucking dollars a oil change 
2276 2018-07-30 18:44:16 Serious question: I honestly can’t comprehend the pro coal and oil views of the Right. I didn’t comprehend it when I was in the Right (though I had a defensiveness about anything liberal). Facts are facts. As a Christian I’ve always been a truth seeker so wtaf??
2277 2018-07-30 18:44:15 Pop's overalls still smell of dirt  oil and diesel Love that smell.. miss you old man..
2278 2018-07-30 18:43:57 Why would the oil giants like Exxon, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, etc. (all of whom support carbon taxation in principle), want to destroy the oil refining business? Without refining, their oil is worthless. And they all own refineries anyway.
2279 2018-07-30 18:43:53 Oil & vinager.
2280 2018-07-30 18:43:53 I just need my oil changed
2281 2018-07-30 18:43:51 As I said:

If you personally want to invest the f.e. US$ 600 Million in one oilfield to get to the oil...go ahead...

Also: Yes, often it’s the idea alone, paired with tests etc. that generates revenue. No hard labor at all. Just labs and machines...
2282 2018-07-30 18:43:33 Trump right again, we pay 70% of cost of NATO to protect European countries from Russia, then Turkey buys billion of dollars a year to Russia for oil and gas.  Problem
2283 2018-07-30 18:43:31 Cbd oil
2284 2018-07-30 18:43:27 It’s a lot cheaper to make your own! Whether you like rose oil, tea tree or even lavender. They have so many for like $5-6. If you have an empty spray bottle, add a few drops to a quarter of the oil and fill the rest with water! Super cheap cleansing water without any additives!
2285 2018-07-30 18:43:20 Jyst wanna say Mother Nature fucked me again.. all geared up .. bathing suit.. tanning oil .. the whole nine yards.. and cloudy af like why?!!!! Guess I’m not tanning td!!

2292 2018-07-30 18:42:40 Lets start refining our own crude for domestic consumption. Industrial consumption, anything inside Canada that uses oil for low rate. Export the surplus crude for whatever the market will accept. This USA bullshit refining bullshit has got to stop.
2293 2018-07-30 18:42:35 Walker is in the Koch brothers pockets. That's why he stopped the high speed train. It wasn't that it would cost wisconsinites tax $$$ ( because now we know republicans don't really care about our tax $) no, the Koch are in oil.
2294 2018-07-30 18:42:33 Can you elaborate? I'm not following. 

What do you mean switch to plant fats? Vegetable oil is already ubiquitous.
2295 2018-07-30 18:42:12 Glad you're finding something to help. CBD oil is finally making the rounds here in Missouri. I may give it a try. Cannabis products I think are a way better option than the heavy, man made psychotropics. Keep us updated!

2301 2018-07-30 18:41:28 la transition est une lecture universitaire d'analyse de la pensée majoritaire néolibérale par contre une lutte politique pour changer de société face au capitalisme ce n'est pas dans les cercles universitaires que cela se passera.
2302 2018-07-30 18:41:27 Oil and water don’t mix! Pedophilia can never fit in!
2303 2018-07-30 18:40:48 Argentina’s previous Administration’s policies have resulted in 16 years of underinvestment in the oil and gas sector. The Heavy Oil has been neglected for 16 years. Timing is ripe to explore and produce heavy oil in Argentna
2304 2018-07-30 18:40:47 oil & vinegar on a sub are SO important
2305 2018-07-30 18:40:47 Yes, but you're advocating for showing the percentage of perfume oil. I'm saying that's irrelevant. Higher percentage doesn't mean better. There's enough for customers to need to decipher, and yet another angle will just add to the confusion.
2306 2018-07-30 18:40:43 @mrlube Hi there, how much is a synthetic oil change for a 2012 Toyota Sienna? (Calgary, AB)

2317 2018-07-30 18:40:01 You don’t have to smoke weed or get high at all. Try CBD oil or pills. I promise you, you’ll say why haven’t I been on this sooner.

2322 2018-07-30 18:39:15 The discount on Cdn Oil benchmark  WCS is ($29).   We are selling our oil for approx ($29) less than the US benchmark WTI.  I though last week at $26.75 was bad, but today is worse.  No Cabinet Minister is talking about this Great Canadian Robbery.

The GOP said the 2nd Iraq War would cost "$100 million, tops" and "the Iraqi oil revenues will pay for all of it."

Project budgeting and planning are not among their strong suits.

2341 2018-07-30 18:36:52 Here is the thing about Italy: they don’t want your garbage products. And they don’t let their best stuff out of the country. You think you’ve had good olive oil? You haven’t unless you’ve been to Tuscany & had it there. #TrumpConte

2344 2018-07-30 18:36:28 I may be deadass broke now but at least my oil is changed and I got a new tire so my car doesn’t give out going back & forth to corbin :-) I hate adulting

2346 2018-07-30 18:36:25 Yes - various viewpoints. Rather dilutes the mob like accusations of Blair as war criminal. Perhaps we should have let saddam control ME oil. I wonder what the downstream consequences of that would have been. Until all men behave as brothers there will be difficult choices.
2347 2018-07-30 18:36:10 As someone who has major trust issues with jarred sauce I have to say @Bertolli garlic and olive oil does not taste like it comes in a jar
2348 2018-07-30 18:36:08 I have to pump myself up before an oil change because I’m really gullible and easily persuaded and all I can afford right now is my oil and my tires rotated. Stay strong girl 
2349 2018-07-30 18:36:07 Favourable move for India . Hope it has no caveat linked to it ?  Reduction of high tech arms import from Russia or a curb on import of oil from Iran ?
2350 2018-07-30 18:36:01 Found some beard oil I forgot I had, applied it, now my face smells like french fries.
2351 2018-07-30 18:35:49 Got any 3/1 oil or w-40? 

Another thing- if you have a short piece of pipe that will go over the wrench handle you can use it as a breaker bar, extend the length of the wrench and get more leverage.

We know fracking, oil, & natural gas cause health & environmental problems, but we have lots of oil & gas, so ignore progress & better living for all in the name of easy dollars, ignorance, & pride

2359 2018-07-30 18:34:10 The ease of fallacy with data presentation 

Does this graphic show revenue that accrued to the federal government alone? 
Or revenue that would have been shared between the concerned oil companies and the three levels of government?

2366 2018-07-30 18:33:00 Also worth noting that Heitkamp is pretty friendly to oil and gas as far as dems go. It's not like they're pulling their support for Cramer to back a leader in environmental regulations
2367 2018-07-30 18:32:54 Why nominate incompetent cabinet members if not to repay campaign contributors ?  Why give access to National Parklands to mining, oil, lumber campaign contributors?  Why continue to keep Ivanka and Jarad on our payroll-illegally? Why continue to want to scar America with a wall?

2376 2018-07-30 18:32:04 You do of course understand how they generate that smoke don't you? Seems funny we're environmentally aware in one area, such as plastic straws, but we think pumping out half burned oil into our skies is pretty !!!
2377 2018-07-30 18:31:51 I have never been treated so poorly in my life. She even had my pharmacy records sent to her. Told the nurses I was a drug addict. Made fun of my use of cannabis. I use mostly CBD oil with a little thc. It helps my muscle spasms from dystonia better than anything else. Bitch!
2378 2018-07-30 18:31:32 It isn't for me, though it is a special treat I buy for my cats every so often. They love the oil.
2379 2018-07-30 18:31:30 Maybe there's anointing oil in it 
2380 2018-07-30 18:31:28 I need to schedule my oil change
2381 2018-07-30 18:30:48 Going into hour two of waiting on my car while it gets an oil change. A service that easily takes twenty minutes. I don’t have the patience for adult life.

2402 2018-07-30 18:28:07 This tweet is the perfect example of how Bernie supporters are in a cult. They show no deference to anyone but their charismatic snake oil peddler, and they take their cues from the top because he's too egotistical to acknowledge anyone else's achievements.
2403 2018-07-30 18:27:46 Oh hell.  Asking Trump about economic development in Italy?   Trump says he has some Italian products?  Olive oil?  This presser is a joke.

2405 2018-07-30 18:27:29 The point of sanctions are not about hurting him as it is to hurt all in North Korea, atleast China and Russia won't commit genocide for sake of pleasing the United States and its allies by cutting off oil. Medical and industrial equipment import ban killed enough people already.

2407 2018-07-30 18:26:54 I’m really sad because I’m obsessed with the smell of Moroccan oil shampoo and always go back to it for the smell specifically but I’m pretty sure my scalp is allergic to it 
2408 2018-07-30 18:26:40 without doubt but as henry would have doubters / detractors he still revolutionised transport in oil era. i'm not aware of any individual (with en mass means) who could produce transport with adequate range/reliability. affordability is not there yet. but look back in 70 years

Not exactly the spirit that won a world war.
2414 2018-07-30 18:25:55 I’ve learned a lot about hair in general from learning about black hair types and black hair maintenance that I utilize (ie jojoba oil, curl care) that I never would have learned otherwise. It seems kinda like how our white ancestors had to be taught about hygiene too.

2428 2018-07-30 18:24:37 Amazing that millions are suffering in Iran daily and all many care about is whether the oil markets are up or down due to  sanctions.

2430 2018-07-30 18:24:25 During Obama’s admin, the DEA created a rule making cannabidoil illegal, which prompted raids on CBD retailers.

2437 2018-07-30 18:23:26 I mean if you're having to shop around to get the cheapest possible oil filter available, you really can't afford to own a car. The most expensive you can get is probably £15. The least will be about £4 and full of Chinese newspapers.

2439 2018-07-30 18:22:50 Find a good oil to use - like Argan or Rosehip Seed oil - and it will change your life! 
2440 2018-07-30 18:22:44 More efficient transportation means a great use of resources. Why use oil domestically and support OPEC, when the US could sell its oil, or use it for something other than burning it? Why give money to other counties that don’t like us? Why give them that power?

2444 2018-07-30 18:22:29 Honestly, the longest part is waiting for the pan to heat the oil into itself. Just clean it, rub it down, and put it in the oven. Five minutes of work for a seasoned pan that kicks ass.
2445 2018-07-30 18:22:24 I had no idea such a thing existed. I've been using the oil attachment for my PAX 3 for ever now and dealing with wax getting everywhere in the oven. I had no idea a better way to live already existed.

2449 2018-07-30 18:21:50 What a ridiculous statement.  Defies logic.  Take Alberta for example, Not many people can drink their well water in that province because they sacrificed it to the altar of oil and gas.

2471 2018-07-30 18:20:28 I'd further say it's down to a mixture of people selling crap on eBay and also major national motor factors having a race to the bottom so they can say they do oil filters for 20p or something.

2476 2018-07-30 18:19:56 Gran Tierra Energy Inc. and Petroamerica Oil Corp. merged on Jan. 13, 2016
If you look back at the growth of Petroamerica from a startup, then ask if Ralph Gilchrist thinks he can do this again in Pentanova/CruzSur because if the resource is there he knows how to exploit it.
2477 2018-07-30 18:19:30 Somehow, given the interest in fracking, I doubt much in the way of new onshore oil or gas will be extracted, not that there’s a lot onshore anyway.
2478 2018-07-30 18:19:29 Young Living accidentally sent me a $98 essential oil instead of what I ordered lol I ain’t even mad

2480 2018-07-30 18:19:25 Data ownership is the most valuable aspect of this though.  @gambo_hamzat says data is the new oil and I couldn't agree more. I especially dont like the idea of public institutions using this free wifi but i''m excited that Kaduna will benefit early so i'll see how it works.
2481 2018-07-30 18:19:18 this hot oil treatment got my hair so soft!!!
2482 2018-07-30 18:18:59 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2483 2018-07-30 18:18:54 When your oil change is faster than an address change at the DMV.

2485 2018-07-30 18:18:14 Haven’t tried it at night I actually smoke to be able to sleep , but during the day I smoke CBD oil or CBD tintures on hot tea and makes me feel worry free no anxiety and some how my energy level is boosted lol

2490 2018-07-30 18:17:24 Forget the oil sands for a moment. What you're really getting at is that a Western lifestyle isn't sustainable, isn't consistent with keeping temp rise to 1.5C. Are you arguing for radical policy changes, the WWII-style approach to mobilizing society to combat global warming?

2492 2018-07-30 18:17:15 El precio del petróleo ajustado a la inflación en los años finales de los 70 era de 90 dólares, hoy casi 50 años después está en 70.

Hace falta que os diga algo más ? 
#petróleo #cl #oil #brent
2493 2018-07-30 18:16:56 It depends on the oil price what the reserves are. Two years ago there would have been very little. Today it’s more because the price has gone up.
2494 2018-07-30 18:16:53 I wish I had some xtra funds, I'd contribute some towards a window unit a/c and a couple of portable oil filled heaters for him

2496 2018-07-30 18:16:37 The oil is the only thing that makes canned tuna minimally acceptable!

2504 2018-07-30 18:15:45 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
2505 2018-07-30 18:15:36 Seeing what countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar do with their oil money, makes me wonder whether Nigeria sells groundnut oil.
2506 2018-07-30 18:15:34 i use coconut oil religiously
2507 2018-07-30 18:15:32 Maybe on his way to visit Bernie at one of his mansions? All these socialist/communists are hypocrites selling political snake oil remedies. #FuckSocialism
2508 2018-07-30 18:15:27 By the the time the low sulfur diesel rules are implemented Jan 2020, diesel could get very expensive. Latin America will need alternative source than mideast to fuel their economies. CruzSur could offset this. 50,000 BBL/day by 2022 is possible with heavy oil belt.
2509 2018-07-30 18:15:26 getting cat hairs stuck in a wet oil painting is the worst fucking thing
2510 2018-07-30 18:15:18 Okay okay  yeah I have fine hair it’s not thick at all and I’ve been using a mixture of tea tree, peppermint & jojoba oil! Only for about a month now. I’m always experimenting with different natural products!
2511 2018-07-30 18:15:08 Okay, points taken. 
With that said, the oil price crash had a lot to do with the 2015 recession.
2512 2018-07-30 18:15:04 even tho coconut oil is “comodogenic” it won’t give u acne bc it’s antibacterial/antimicrobial. stay woke
2513 2018-07-30 18:14:55 Thank you !  I hate when they don’t believe me I feel like I’m lying to myself haha ! Have you tried coconut oil ? I think that’s helped grow them out a bit and using no eyelash curler!
2514 2018-07-30 18:14:42 fun friendly tip: 

DO NOT put tea tree oil on your freshly exfoliated face 
2515 2018-07-30 18:14:19 The sheer entitlement of British nationalists, eh Tom? Seeking the right to our own sovereignty is called ‘whingeing’. As for ‘burden to taxpayer.’ What about £300 billion of Scottish oil revenue squandered on Thatcher’s tax cuts?
2516 2018-07-30 18:14:16 £50 for an oil change? Sorry pal just done it myself, only cost me 20 minutes and £11 for the oil LMAOOO
2517 2018-07-30 18:14:00 My aunt had cancer, she started taking cannabis oil, and having Cannabis in her food, of course organic. And now it's gone. It's definitely curable and you do not need a doctor to do that

2519 2018-07-30 18:13:54 I use the black castor oil and flaxseed gel and hair oil! I just like 3 elastics to get my bun like this lol but I just wrap my hair around. I braided it the day before so it looks puffy
2520 2018-07-30 18:13:46 Never buy oil packed tuna. It’s overwhelming.
2521 2018-07-30 18:13:46 They do tho not just focusing on orcas, they’ve saved manatees in the wild from drain pipes and sea turtles that have been caught in plastic. They cleaned up or ocean friends after the oil spill, the list goes on. they may do bad, but they also do ALOT of good.
2522 2018-07-30 18:13:34 Is it just me or does Jio actually spell oiL in reverse ?
Coincidence much? Or was this intentional?
2523 2018-07-30 18:13:33 At no point in history has crude oil ever been sold at 150$ a barrel. If your whole assertion is built on a flawed premise what value does your statement carry then. You can still make your point without spreading such odoriferous lie. Pls take note, try being credible for once
2524 2018-07-30 18:13:20 You’ll start walking in so much fresh oil of favor that reptilian humans will start opening their mouths and drinking it up with their tongues out. 
2525 2018-07-30 18:13:16 I’ve been hearing a lot about CBD oil and am very interested to try, hate when I have to take a pill in the middle of the day
2526 2018-07-30 18:13:14 Lol baby oil...kiddin
2527 2018-07-30 18:13:01 put water and how ever much beans and start a boil and lower the heat and just check on them make sure there's enough water. Then you you refry them on a pan.. Mash them with oil and the juice from the beans and there you have it
2528 2018-07-30 18:12:56 @Dimitrivorbe It is time to invest in project that can pay for itself, It is ridiculous to hear people talking about Petro Caribe Money while Haiti is sitting on the largest oil reserves in the Caribbean, we have more oil than Venezuela and Cuba combined.
2529 2018-07-30 18:12:54 Also I had no pasatta left so just used tomato purée and was ok. Used olive oil instead of veg too and didn’t seem to alter taste.
2530 2018-07-30 18:12:51 A compatriot reports that SOURCE Z, a confidant of the Ayatollah, states that FRENCH and Mohammad Khatami held secret meetings in Khartoum over the course of 3 months. Khatami offered a 19% stake in the National Iranian Oil company in exchange for access to Hillary Clinton.

2534 2018-07-30 18:12:15 From my experience in secondary school, the oil would be blessed by a man of God first.
So all anointing oil is olive oil but not all olive oil is anointed
2535 2018-07-30 18:12:14 Did you know Italians don't use tomato sauce in a jar? Tomato sauce is sautéed diced tomatos in olive oil. 
2536 2018-07-30 18:12:12 If painted oil drums stacked in a trapezoid isn't art, I don't know what is.

2541 2018-07-30 18:11:49 Maybe..................Oil Starvation Drive ???
2542 2018-07-30 18:11:45 It would really be a global currency coup if #China linked the petroyuan to the Bityuan and oil contracts (futures, forwards, options) went to #ethereum and #hashgraph
#geoeconomics
2543 2018-07-30 18:11:25 Worth noting, for instance, that Canada sells tens of billions of dollars to the US every year in oil and natural gas. What, exactly, are we supposed to buy in return to make up for that?
2544 2018-07-30 18:11:21 Also (not ideal if travelling or sharing quarters with people cos of the smell, but) heating garlic in oil, or buying infused oil and heating it, works really well as a massage balm/salve to relax tension in back and chest muscles from coughing and increased effort of breathing.
2545 2018-07-30 18:11:16 You just described a donut. Refined grains with sugar fried in seed oil. 
The trifecta of death!
2546 2018-07-30 18:10:56 Appreciate to wear the fire resistance clothes in oil and gas industry. It is normal.

However, it is not fully completed as a PPE (Personal protection equipment).  goggle is missed.

2557 2018-07-30 18:09:48 Same, but with water-packed tuna: add yr own olive oil, lemon juice, dash of soy sauce.
2558 2018-07-30 18:09:43 Someone volunteer to take my car to get an oil change, because I hate doing adult things :(
2559 2018-07-30 18:09:42 Ok, what about oil packed tuna and cannelloni beans & red onion as a salad? I want to not hate tinned foods, but tuna makes it hard.
2560 2018-07-30 18:09:39 They nationalized the oil companies. They are sitting on some of the largest reserves in the world but can't pump it. Their economy is totally destroyed so they are resorting to eating their zoo animals due to no food.  Socialism is EVIL you idiot.
2561 2018-07-30 18:09:33 Lol snake oil salesman sells more snake oil

2563 2018-07-30 18:09:28 Are you must pour oil on the Baba Yaga. Well, the girl sat down the cat, and set to her pass through; the eyes of limb, quickly
2564 2018-07-30 18:09:15 Will do, I think it was spearmint oil but don’t have any, did buy a sprayer and hit with mist every so often, usually right after I’ve put out bee food.
2565 2018-07-30 18:09:13 The high level oil industry is a long time factor in TX and other regions. Its relatively recent boom in ND/MT has lead to substantial changes in various social, economic, and cultural data points in what is a pretty sparsely populated region. This doesnt really apply elsewhere.
2566 2018-07-30 18:09:13 Rotation out of tech into Oil/Gas is underway. A bigger haircut than anyone expects?
2567 2018-07-30 18:09:01 @Dimitrivorbe Hi, how are you doing . I have a master Degree in Accounting at UH in Houston Texas, I believe we both love numbers and love Haiti. I have a question for you, I know you are entrepreneur, why you don't inverse in oil exploration in Haiti ? What is stopping you ?
2568 2018-07-30 18:08:56 me: could i get an oil change please

2572 2018-07-30 18:08:09 That's because Tesla shouldn't be the one pioneering all this technology. Our country should be investing in it and making affordable Solutions. But our country is ran by Rich oil manufacturers that don't benefit from electric vehicles.

2583 2018-07-30 18:06:19 Let's say that oil, gas, mining, ranching, etc move forward and Garfield County loses its wild lands, air pollution is giving their kids reactive lung disease, and it goes through a boom/bust cycle. What kind of life is that?
2584 2018-07-30 18:06:18 COOKING TIP: Before placing homemade pizza into the oven, sprinkle with some extra virgin olive oil for a silkier taste and lush texture.
2585 2018-07-30 18:05:57 Why doesn't the Press ever ask the American president why does he have these meetings with these foreign leaders that he doesn't give a s*** about unless it's Putin?? Are there offers of oil deals?! @KatyTurNBC @MSNBC

2612 2018-07-30 18:01:43 Remember the low-fat craze of the 90s, where processed carbs were proclaimed the nutritious alternative to “unhealthy” foods like full-fat dairy, meat, and coconut oil? 

The “experts” were food mega-Corp employees and lobbyists. 

Question “experts.”

2628 2018-07-30 17:59:09 UKGov are terrified of losing Scotland. In fact the Brexit shambles will seem like a walk in the park for them when Scotland become Independent and they lose S oil revenue,S exports, S electricity, S water etc.This is why they continually lie to try to save the union.
2629 2018-07-30 17:59:04 They are blissfully unaware that we joined the EEC originally because we were know in 1970's as "The sick man of Europe forced to beg borrow and steal until North Sea Oil comes in" some older folk have very selective memories!

2637 2018-07-30 17:57:18 Actually, what Scotland gains is the tax revenue.  It doesn't own the oil or gas - the operators do - so the figs on export are of academic interest only.  The tax is useful though & imho should be used solely to reduce our dependency on oil & gas & building a renewables industry

2690 2018-07-30 17:51:49 I checked Iran’s oil production numbers. They are up about 35% in the last two years. There was a small drop in late 2017. Flat since then. Still WAY up over 2016.

They account for 5% of the world’s production.

Nope. It can’t be Iranian oil production causing the problem.

2697 2018-07-30 17:50:25 Long gardening morning: had to move containers so new neighbors can move in, add a couple supports, spray with a soap/baking soda/oil combo (works for white flies, some fungus), & water. Not that hot today; still pretty drenched when done. Check out my IG for photos (domynoe)!
2698 2018-07-30 17:50:16 we should be worried about boko haram and Fulani herdsmen and not America, our foreign policy has seceded our oil resource to the west and so we are in good standing with America, Britain and France ...
2699 2018-07-30 17:50:11 I see what the point you are making.  At the same time, during several of those time frames, the dollar still continued to lose buying power while other assets (gold, silver, crude oil) skyrocketed in value.  As long as the dollar continues to be printed it loses its value.
2700 2018-07-30 17:50:10 The smell of olive oil makes me gag, I can’t even imagine drinking it for any reason.
2701 2018-07-30 17:50:04 Over the last 10 years, we’ve seen certain nutritional supplements  making their way into mainstream medicine. Fish oil, for example, has human clinical trials for several indications, as well as epidemiological and biochemical data.
2702 2018-07-30 17:50:02 And I see you feel everything is “relative” when it comes to taxes..... let’s apply this logic ....compared to most jurisdictions in the world our environmental laws on oil and gas extraction are stringent - therefore what’s the problem ?   Logic and facts are a pesky thing.
2703 2018-07-30 17:49:47 Exactly! So time to cut these subsidies and help the financial industry revalue these assets and oil drops like a big thick one #sustainablefinanceeu #climatechange

2731 2018-07-30 17:45:07 You would be wrong. The majority of pollution in China and other countries is due to the unregulated manufacturing industry as well as the large oil burning machinery.

2741 2018-07-30 17:43:59 'Rainbows End' exhibition of oil paintings by Chetana Sund continues this week.  Gallery open Tue - Sun 12-pm
2742 2018-07-30 17:43:58 My PhD was funded by a real estate baron; my current job by an oil baron; my next one by a steel baron. 
2743 2018-07-30 17:43:57 That pipeline is important to all of Canada. Do you also protest oil by rail? Far less safe than pipelines. How about the pipeline going to the airport? How about all that dirty coal leaving the port?
2744 2018-07-30 17:43:41 Lol okay, sorry we don't all work in the Oil rigs

2746 2018-07-30 17:43:12 The wine is the love and the oil is the joy! Full outpouring from the divine Child in your bellies!
2747 2018-07-30 17:42:51 Idle well bonds should cover the cost of plugging the well.  Operators who have gone bankrupt in other states leaving orphan wells should not be allowed to operate.  When Oil prices go down its the Bankrupt companies that riddle the area with Orphan wells.
2748 2018-07-30 17:42:38 Someone somewhere has to burn the midnight oil
2749 2018-07-30 17:42:29 Oil producing States? give them cattle ranches

Cattle producing States? give them refinary

State Elections? send 30,000 police

State Killings? send 1000 police

IPOB? label them terrorists 

Killer herdsmen? label them foreigners

my own is to post.....

2753 2018-07-30 17:41:25 “Naturopathic oncology” is a fraudy sham that endangers cancer patients with deadly misinformation, unproven tmts, and snake oil.

2757 2018-07-30 17:40:35 I bought a 400ml essential oil diffuser and now I’m just going wild with it. My house always smells like some crazy shit.

2765 2018-07-30 17:39:43 I LOVE thunder and lightning. I love big storms at night when I'm sitting inside watching movies or on the pc burning the midnight oil. Which that expression doesn't fair well for me since I'm old and go to bed at like 830

2769 2018-07-30 17:39:15 Hahaha your country’s income almost %50 created by oil. What you gonna do after World begin to stop using oil in the middle of the desert?  you can’t compare Turkey and saudi. Your women just begin to drive car. Big shame!

2771 2018-07-30 17:39:08 Can you let us know about the calculation? How many years is this program for? Current Account Deficit is now $17.5bil. Investment inflows apparently were around $2 bil. So looks like $12 bil will keep Pakistan afloat for a year(considering oil credits and Chinese loan)?
2772 2018-07-30 17:39:04 I truly think you are correct. Two years wasted on negotiations when we know Brussels will not deviate from their vision of a soulless europe.
BREXIT means no deal. 
But why would a party destroy itself. In one word oil.
2773 2018-07-30 17:39:00 Why would we refine oil from another country when we have our own? Does that make sense to you?
2774 2018-07-30 17:38:59 Does anyone have any good tools to get small extra gig business partners to help cross promote each other through social media or small commercials? I wanna expand our listener base and the only options we have are a Micro Blade company and someone who sells CBD oil. Thanks!
2775 2018-07-30 17:38:54 Well some people believe you should never change transmission fluid. Gear oil is fine till it either gets water in it or it fills up with metal shavings.
2776 2018-07-30 17:38:46 Why the need to refer to our investment as oil money.Get over yourself.
2777 2018-07-30 17:38:15 I have known enough of this from living next to a farm, spraying multiple times culminating with one just a couple of days before harvest...would not touch rapeseed oil ever. Luckily this year has been the last...Farm turning organic like the rest of the Neston Estate

2784 2018-07-30 17:37:28 injected it right into "in between contact" space of test switch (separate) and so far (per multimeter and per test diode) it works just fine.
Apparently all the extra oil gets flushed out when metal membrane flexes (there's a small drop forming), and gets sucked back on release

2789 2018-07-30 17:37:13 A weak pressure pumping market and and a strong super spec rig market makes it tough to play the oil field service names. My followers however know about  $ICD, the pure play super spec rig company that just doubled its fleet & trades at a 50% discount to NAV.
2790 2018-07-30 17:37:04 I think the term “snake oil” is from the 19th century.  It worked!  Not always, though.

Maar goed het werkt wel tegen #fruitvliegjes.

2794 2018-07-30 17:36:34 but it's more than $4.5 billion we are losing ~$200 million daily selling 97% of our oil to USA over $30 USA/barrel below world market plus importing at full price to feed East coast refineries...plus all the bureaucratic costs of Justin's path & increasing costs of construction
2795 2018-07-30 17:36:19 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
2796 2018-07-30 17:36:18 Is it that u re nt aware d Katsina refinery is a partnership btw Niger & Naija 2 refine oil frm Niger, o u re just bein mischievous & stupid
2797 2018-07-30 17:36:16 We out here operating heavy machinery. Probably stream this evening after getting my oil changed. Enjoy your Monday dudes
2798 2018-07-30 17:36:13 I need to lear how to do an oil change on my own bc paying to get it done is overrated.
2799 2018-07-30 17:36:03 It’s a combo of!  Their agenda of destroying ACA healthcare, cutting Medicare/Cal, SS, and imprisoning families without due process, certainly isn’t helping!  Trump and Zinke are trying to open up Nationally Protected lands for mining, oil drilling, etc., and that’s sneaky too!
2800 2018-07-30 17:35:46 I didn’t realize tuna with oil was considered high class... The rich can keep that nastiness, then.
2801 2018-07-30 17:35:45 I wanna be a cast iron dragon sleeping on a bed of coarse salt and scrubbing myself fastidiously with fine river sand before wiping down with veg oil and toasting myself for a couple hours into a glossy sheen
2802 2018-07-30 17:35:32 Have you ever wondered how people with a poor eyesight see the world without glasses or contact lenses? The artist Philip Barlow show it vividly to us through his fascinating oil paintings.
2803 2018-07-30 17:35:27 *clicks profile* Oh, look, another oil industry shill. Get lost.
2804 2018-07-30 17:35:15 @Swearbycare hey just tryna shine some light on the skincare brand The Ordinary, they have fantastic products like retinol, salicylic acid, rosehip oil and many many more for very affordable prices. 100% honest about what's in their products and cruelty free!

Lols, get yourself a bottle of one a day pills. Itll really help put oil in the gears :)
2808 2018-07-30 17:34:25 Addiction is great, currently at work just thinking about the 200 bars , 7 bottles of don questo tequila, 3 sheets of acid, one qp of weed, an oz of oil, and 100 oxycontins that Im trying not to empty my bank account and quit my job for
2809 2018-07-30 17:34:22 So yesterday my car didn't want to turn on, but I managed to turn it on after a while. And now today, it almost didn't want to turn on againI don't know what's wrong with my car&I had just recently done an oil change too!These mechanics better not have messed up my car!
2810 2018-07-30 17:34:18 If there’s another civil war, I’m moving to North Dakota.  Not only is the state rich in oil, it also houses a good chunk of our strategic arsenal at Minot AFB-useful bargaining chips when petitioning to rejoin the British Empire, as @GrayConnolly would doubtlessly agree
2811 2018-07-30 17:34:03 That’s what @ZinsserUK brush Cleaner is for, the oil based isn’t a straight forward white spirit product. Otherwise it couldn’t be weatherproof in 1hr and recoatable in 3.

Psalm 92:10
“But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.”
2815 2018-07-30 17:33:43 yeah first off no more Trident to pay for no more London vanity protects. Scotland tax and revenue and oil stays in Scotland and away from the corruption in London at Westminster.
2816 2018-07-30 17:33:35 Veo difícil terminar como Noruega. Hace un tiempo leí "The Norwegian Oil Experience: A toolbox for managing resources?" de Helge Ryggvik. Muy recomendable para entender el fenómeno más allá de la enfermedad holandesa.
2817 2018-07-30 17:33:29 No, we use home remedies like that too. Eggs, mayo, oil, etc. anything with a lot of cholesterol and protein is good for your hair. Proteins and fats are used in hair products too, but I know some people that don’t put anything in their hair that they can’t eat. Organic.
2818 2018-07-30 17:33:25 And yet the US is relying heavily on a new oil pipeline coming from the Canadian oil sands 
2819 2018-07-30 17:33:23 Yes. Late 70s winters were tough times. Power cuts, Home heating oil freezing up. Maybe people were just getting familiar with it ? Here in Kilkenny we had 13 days lying snow (>1cm depth) in winter 78 and 16 days in 79. We had less days in 63 (12 days) due to it being dry cold.
2820 2018-07-30 17:33:20 failure is also data and that data can be monetized. That is grand scheme for data is the new oil

2843 2018-07-30 17:29:46 I think a Bab Al Mandab blockade by Yemen's Houthi-controlled military forces for ALL oil tankers is very low on the list of possibilities.
2844 2018-07-30 17:29:26 “Hm it’s on the night stand where you left it baby.” She smiled and giggled at the thought of using that oil, last time they used it Helen got fucked like a little whore and couldn’t do her hero activities for a whole day from being so sore.
2845 2018-07-30 17:29:13 “Oil use: The agencies project their proposal will mean U.S. consumption will ultimately increase by 500,000 barrels of oil per day, or about 182 million barrels a year.” Under what time frame?

2855 2018-07-30 17:27:52 I think, in general, our mail in ballot system works. There are many in our country who work "2 on and 2 off" in the oil field, for example, who use ballots to vote in their home state. It could be more limited but I wouldn't go quite as far as just active military/PI.

2874 2018-07-30 17:25:05 we just need to take it all out, the parts are too corroded for the machine to keep working. No amount of oil is gonna fix it. Just get rid of the old parts, make a new engine.

2876 2018-07-30 17:24:48 IMO 2020 will draw out the quality issues with LTO. We have moved from lower cost conventional reservoir oil, to higher cost source rock oil. The source rock oil (LTO) contains no mid dist from my understanding. Dist inv way tighter than gas already... @aeberman12
2877 2018-07-30 17:24:43 Oil prices traded higher on Monday, bouncing back after their  fourth-straight weekly loss last week amid emerging evidence of  oversupply, as some traders moved in at lower prices amid a confluence  of bullish factors.

2885 2018-07-30 17:23:53 I am here for Ranching. That is the only feasible solution to the herdsmen crisis. Dont let politicians turn you against sustainable solution to a nagging problem. Oil will finish, human will survive.
2886 2018-07-30 17:23:48 Seriously I love using oil cleanser so much. It is amazing. I don't know how to tell you. You should try. But be careful, choose the right ingredient for your skin.
2887 2018-07-30 17:23:46 My definition is not you, you are a snake oil salesman Gary. Slither along now and on to your next venture.

2891 2018-07-30 17:22:55 And how can you trust that when the label says it contains extra virgin olive oil that it is actually that? My wife and I found some single source certified extra virgin olive oil and it is so much different than anything I had previously tasted - Peppery and delicious!
2892 2018-07-30 17:22:43 Olive oil
2893 2018-07-30 17:22:31 Definitely a great product.  Been using it for years on our boat.
2894 2018-07-30 17:22:22 We do currently have two products for dogs. One is an oil that is thc-free and the other are all-natural CBD chews made with no corn, wheat or soy. Actually ordered a bag for my dog who I am currently using oil for.
2895 2018-07-30 17:22:15 Chop it up and wash it as you wish steam it in salt water for two mins. Let it completely drain out using a strainer and then heat up your oil throw in some chopped garlic and a dash of parsley let them fry for about 1min and add in your cauliflower throw in your peppers & onions
2896 2018-07-30 17:22:07 Oil preserves the tuna much better, according to Julia Child.
2897 2018-07-30 17:22:00 Sure. Let's cut the billions in subsidies that go to the oil companies. They don't need that.
Let's also cut federal assistance for Walmart employees by forcing Walmart to raise their wages.
Let's also cut military - they think they're entitled to drop a bomb every 12 minutes...
2898 2018-07-30 17:21:59 Am I the only person that thinks @garyvee is a snake oil salesman? He 'teaches' simple and general techniques that can be applied to anything, he is the human version of a fortune cookie. @garyvee is #FakeNews
2899 2018-07-30 17:21:43 Bug oil didn't dig up coal or build power plants 

But oil did produce cheap clean-burning natural gas thats replaces coal and lead to lowest  US CO2 emissions in 25 yrs in 2017.

Maybe we should thank big oil for that
2900 2018-07-30 17:21:43  I almost ditched my oil change for a beach day  glad i didn't
2901 2018-07-30 17:21:40 Tuna in oil more tender- better on a salad if ur skipping the mayo. Tuna salad another story. Water packed. Diced red onion/dill pickle (or relish). Slice of american (optional). Toasted rye/bagel. Don't forget the chips.

2927 2018-07-30 17:18:08 Is medical marijuana legal where you live? If so, you may want to try it and see if it helps. (I take a 1:1 THC:CBD blend that doesn't get me high.) CBD oil itself (no THC) may work if MMJ isn't an option. Drugs like Cymbalta & Lyrica may also help. #ActuallyAutistic #ChronicPain

2935 2018-07-30 17:17:16 I was trying to figure out what to have for lunch and it will be water packed tuna, mayo made with olive oil on a piece of ak-mak. It’s very close to what you are having but it won’t clog my colon or arteries. ;)

2940 2018-07-30 17:16:39 I'm sure that's why the oil industry suggested it.
2941 2018-07-30 17:16:37 America wasn’t founded upon oil nor do I think it’s future should be restricted by oil.

2963 2018-07-30 17:14:02 That's so frustrating! Do they not use plastic wrap? Do they recycle all their cooking oil? Do they only buy from sustainable farms? They don't use ANY ingredients that come in plastic? Probably not, bc it's easier to hurt disabled people than actually care.

3013 2018-07-30 17:07:50 If you’re struggling with acne/acne blemishes, mix a decent amount of vaseline petroleum jelly and a drop or two of grapefruit essential oil together and apply it on your face at night
3014 2018-07-30 17:07:50 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ At least in public.

Advancing the Oil & Gas Industry's literally-Cuisinart-for-the-birds meme about most wind power is the actual subtext.
3015 2018-07-30 17:07:30 If you dilute snake oil, does it still make it stronger?
3016 2018-07-30 17:07:25 $85 for a oil change

3020 2018-07-30 17:07:02 @FairFuelUK surprisingly some garages round here have actually dropped prices the past week (albeit to be nearer the supermarkets) but the oil giants don’t usually do so without supermarkets doing so which is quite surprising!
3021 2018-07-30 17:07:01 Ship carrying cheap oil from Saudi Arabia has docked at port in Tanzania.
When is the ship carrying salaries for civil servants docking at Zanaco Atm port?
3022 2018-07-30 17:06:54 I drink water....... The glow really be oil leaving my pores lol
3023 2018-07-30 17:06:44 Oil powered cars have become unnecessary and stupid.

And me not having a gentle mist of lavender filling my apartment every night before bed is not going to be good for anyone. 
3029 2018-07-30 17:06:15 Can we please stop pretending that Trump team Cambridge Analytica isn't destroying democracy worldwide for trillions in profit & alliances without ethics. Brexit, ending NAFTA/NATO Secret meetings: Bolton/MEK, Seychelles backchannel, Alliances/war with Iran, Oil & nuclear reactor
3030 2018-07-30 17:06:12 Fried Soybean Cake : Slice  1 block of fermented soybean cake. Sprinkle with salt. Fry in hot oil till brown and slightly dry. Drain. Recipe needs adjusting for tons of trade embargoed soybeans. Trump supporters,  EAT UP.

3033 2018-07-30 17:05:56 Yeah I am more interested in growing industrial hemp then the high CBD oil stuff, looks like it has potential to have some nice bi-products for dairy, bedding and what is left after crushing, but have to find a crush site nearby.
3034 2018-07-30 17:05:37 For sandwiches, yes. But for salads, I'd go with oil.
3035 2018-07-30 17:05:33 Monday morning coffee tasted like @Valvoline motor oil and I couldn’t be more pleased. Useful and tasty. 10/10 would recommend.
3036 2018-07-30 17:05:33 To do a hot oil treatment and wear a wrap to work or just say fuck it and wash my hair without a treatment before hand
3037 2018-07-30 17:05:32 After patiently waiting for more than 20 days to receive a reply from @BMW regarding my issue with my vehicle. They told me that nothing can be done from their end to fix my car due to a  technicality regarding oil changes.
3038 2018-07-30 17:05:31 Your father! Which “light back” and “refineries back “ your fake baba spent billions of our public fund looking for crude oil in his geo- political zone to no avail. Waste! Waste!! Waste!!!  of our resources.
3039 2018-07-30 17:05:16 @carlbildt remind us AGAIN dear sir how did you acquire your fortune? Was it by constantly violating human rights through the oil company you were serving? Poor politician and even poorer personality
3040 2018-07-30 17:05:13 More, it indicates a diversification in the economy. 
Those still not benefiting are people tied to the oil patch.
3041 2018-07-30 17:05:04 Spend 32 trillion to save 2 trillion
No wonder you're the poorest member of Senate.
3042 2018-07-30 17:04:59 Would you support a nationalisation of the oil industry in order to ensure investments into the agriculture industry?
3043 2018-07-30 17:04:54 I like oil pulling with coconut
3044 2018-07-30 17:04:50 This opinion is acceptable.  I never go the tuna in oil thing.
3045 2018-07-30 17:04:30 Can’t wait to find oil and sale it to everyone else. It will be good to see an entire American planet. That way we can move there. #newplanet #intern
3046 2018-07-30 17:04:11 Why is this case different, why do you not argue that the oil is horded and should be distributed by force?  Why should they have all the oil if you are to be logicly consitant?
3047 2018-07-30 17:04:05 I could have told you about him he was a snake oil salesmen here in Bama.
3048 2018-07-30 17:04:04 Put peppermint oil on my hummingbird feeders to keep away wasps. It worked.
3049 2018-07-30 17:03:47 It's made with olive oil, pine nuts, basil, and cheese too! 
My favorite sauce is probably the tomato sauce that goes in seafood pasta! It's not exactly marinara, but more full of seafood flavor!
3050 2018-07-30 17:03:45 This bottle of Cantu beard oil is not dying. I’ve been using the last lil bit for like 2 months
3051 2018-07-30 17:03:39 Look I’ll get you the oil fields by Thursday end of day no problem. I got the Romanians working on it it’ll be fine.
3052 2018-07-30 17:03:36 This Wednesday we have a Toy and Fine Arts and Antiques sale with vintage toys, Beryl Cook limited edition prints, oil paintings and many medals. Catalogue online now.
3053 2018-07-30 17:03:27 Lol EVERYTHING! ... even the olive oil. Homemade is the best and you can do whatever you want with it
3054 2018-07-30 17:03:17 At least no oil light today

3058 2018-07-30 17:03:01 Smush out the oil. Maybe aioli instead of mayo (it’s like fancy mayo). Chop a little pickle into it. A little tomato. You’re good to go.
3059 2018-07-30 17:02:39 One of the 70s Plaid Cymru adverts shows...
Exploration for oil off the welsh coast.
Scotland and england have loads

I BETCHA MOMENT SCOTLAND GOES
WE JUST FOUND HUGE AMOUNTS OF OIL OFF WELSH COAST
I am a half english welsh speaker
Wales is... WHY ARE WE SO SPECIAL?
Coal? FFS?!?
3060 2018-07-30 17:02:24 Wait I thought the water packed kind was the standard. There are people who intentionally buy it in oil? I always grab it by accident and then get mad when I open it.
3061 2018-07-30 17:02:20 Needs sliced tomatoes, olives, olive oil and fresh baked bread.
3062 2018-07-30 17:02:12 Just admit it. The GOP does not know how to govern. 
They can take NRA and Oil dollars and spread hate and lies to get elected, but you can't do a damn thing right once you do.
3063 2018-07-30 17:02:03 We resupplied Israel in the Yom Kippur War. The 1973 Arab Oil Embargo was retaliation for that. The US economy tumbled and never fully recovered. We crippled our own economy for the MFers. It is Israel who should be paying us.

3065 2018-07-30 17:02:00 Covered head to toe in baby oil because it apparently helps take off fake tan and I look like I’m about to film a massaging sex scene on pornhub fs
3066 2018-07-30 17:01:57 Rub small oil on it or saliva on it
3067 2018-07-30 17:01:57 My wife gets by quite lovely with just some co-wash, a water spritz and a pick with occasional oils, but my daughter has to do the full monty to keep her wavy curls from turning into cobwebs, satin cap, co-wash, oil, picking, shower cap so it doesn't get TOO wet or too dry.

3069 2018-07-30 17:01:46 Please give him warm water with turmeric, honey, and a teaspoon of black seed oil every night before bed to have on an empty stomach. It works wonders fighting the side effects. Hope it goes well.
3070 2018-07-30 17:01:42 Yes. And many variations: a little mustard, pickles or relish, celery salt, hard boiled egg.
I didn't know oil packed tuna was fancy!
3071 2018-07-30 17:01:39 Well now you can barely see the drop of olive oil on my skirt....since it's been completely covered by the mess I made trying to clean it off.
3072 2018-07-30 17:01:33 Feeling depressed? Use olive oil and garlic.
3073 2018-07-30 17:01:15 ...if you want a real life tip refill it w some CBD oil
3074 2018-07-30 17:01:14 Gives me an idea... instead of an oil pipeline to tide water, suppose we were really building a Hyper Loop.... :-)

3090 2018-07-30 16:59:07 I can understand the anger over that but I don't think they thought it all the way through. Yeah Alberta has oil, grain and beef but how would we get the rest. I also liked the "if Canada is divisible then so is Alberta" part,

btw city has existed for close to 123 years and hardly had 123 fans before all that oil money.
3093 2018-07-30 16:58:48 I just got a homogenizer so I can make nono-emulsions and up the game of my current CBD oil. Been having great results with my clients. If you can find better than 540mg for $40 let me know, I'm pretty sure my stuff is the best deal on the market, quality is primo.
3094 2018-07-30 16:58:44 Also good for survival situations, very easy to make a can of tuna in oil into an emergency candle.
3095 2018-07-30 16:58:40 I prefer the kind in water and add my own oil.  I have higher standards than they do re:Oil
3096 2018-07-30 16:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3097 2018-07-30 16:58:33 The only reason governments have done this was under the influence of big money to do just that. To control the world, Big Oil has fought many wars, for profits.

3102 2018-07-30 16:58:14 Ur right..he should be working out 24/7 and not have a personal opinion on anything. Especially on a podcast that specializes on players not being "interviewed" formally. All in the name of having a bounce back season for the Oilers.
3103 2018-07-30 16:58:06 if 4.1% GDP is bad news, defeating ISIS is bad news, record low unemployment is bad news, rising wages is bad news, strengthened military is bad news, being the worlds largest oil producer is bad news, if peace in Korea is bad news, what exactly are U & Democrats running on?
3104 2018-07-30 16:58:03 well how would I know the value of an ounce of gold to make sure you are giving me a fair deal? Should I price it in dollars or pounds or yaun? Because thats one of the reasons why USA is much hacked off with Venezuela..they price their oil in Yaun now.
3105 2018-07-30 16:58:01 They managed to get away with it. They had ties to oil companies and airline companies.
3106 2018-07-30 16:57:46 Hello! It is safe to apply Bio‑Oil to the skin on one’s lips. Although no harmful effects are likely, Bio‑Oil is not intended to be ingested so one should take care when applying it to this area.

3111 2018-07-30 16:57:20 southern Russia farmers r rushing to plant soy and corn.  Russia economy is oil  based but now they can enjoy farm exports to asia.  Once markets are gone they are gone.  Funny russian farmers going capitalist american farmers going socialist !  Anything for comrade Trump.
3112 2018-07-30 16:57:11 Did the oil stay the same?
3113 2018-07-30 16:57:10 Please Mr @JustinTrudeau can you atleast do us this favor and ban oil&gas activities in these marine areas

3115 2018-07-30 16:57:00 I wonder whch club will fake manc fans will support after the current owner stops pouring in the oil money into the club.

City=Buying fans since 2008.
3116 2018-07-30 16:56:59 I’m pretty sure you aren’t supposed to make sandwiches with tuna-in-oil. Strictly for salads or cooking.
3117 2018-07-30 16:56:51 Grew up when they didn’t make the tuna in water. All oil all the time. We ate it and LIKED IT.
3118 2018-07-30 16:56:48 fill up the tub with coconut oil and just bathe in it. no regrets
3119 2018-07-30 16:56:45 Dude me too

3122 2018-07-30 16:56:19 The design on the rx8 engine is dumb & i never wanna change my own oil again.
3123 2018-07-30 16:56:13 Heading back to the shop so I can do my oil change
3124 2018-07-30 16:55:57 yes. tuna in oil works better for nicoise type salad.
3125 2018-07-30 16:55:31 HORRIBLE person & thought BUT I dont think the flooding in Myanmar would be so bad if they kept the trees instead of tearing it all apart for palm oil.

3128 2018-07-30 16:55:03 Do you know why the Trumpsters look past Russia? It’s an oil- producing state.
3129 2018-07-30 16:55:01 I mix my own oil and use that on my scalp...
3130 2018-07-30 16:54:58 Congrats #Susan, looking barely 14, but already a #mother of #four & #windowed by war in #SouthSudan

If "a picture is worth a thousand words" about the manifold crises in #Africa, this is it. The use of firewood and deforestation, health risk from smoke inhalation & boiling oil
3131 2018-07-30 16:54:57 I love tuna. I always buy tuna in water. Few months back decided to try tuna in oil. Nasty
3132 2018-07-30 16:54:24 I finally got my oil changed like a responsible adult
3133 2018-07-30 16:54:18 cuando Joanna Newsom canta: "My heart is heavy as an oil drum / I don't want to be alone / My heart is yellow as an ear of corn, / and I have torn my soul apart, from / pulling artlessly with fool commands" she did THAT
3134 2018-07-30 16:54:14 A customer at work came up to me asking for a shot of olive oil to drink
3135 2018-07-30 16:54:07 Im just down here taking all the oil and gas money, like all the other transplants. So fuck off if im not allowed to cheer for my hometown teams.
3136 2018-07-30 16:54:04 Bottom line Jones is an oil man! That’s how he got rich... no doubt this pig loves Russians too! I wonder if he likes all the things Trump and his Russians do in their relaxation time? #endSexTraffiking
3137 2018-07-30 16:53:56 Turkish construction firm Tekfen and Saudi oil company Aramco sign $590 million construction agreement to build pipelines at satellite gas compression plants.
3138 2018-07-30 16:53:39 wonder if my mama will get my oil change tomorrow 
3139 2018-07-30 16:53:25 Numerous weeping fissures under the Gulf of Mexico bed releasing gas and oil.
3140 2018-07-30 16:53:16 With Trump #CorruptionIsTotal so always look for THE most corrupt motive(s). 

Fewer new cars sold means more gas guzzlers on the road longer. Depressing urban (Dem) areas, selling more dirty oil. And collapsing a key US industry so Russia & China can export more eventually.
3141 2018-07-30 16:53:14 Big Oil

3144 2018-07-30 16:52:58 It's green liquid gold - oil made of pumpkin seeds. Perfect for garnishing creamy soups like pumpkin soup. We mostly use it as salad dressing instead of other oils. You can also mix vanilla ice cream with it. It's very common in my area in Austria 
3145 2018-07-30 16:52:35 the world just needs to take 2-3 days and say “NO” to each and every order (auto parts .. oil .. water .. soybeans) placed from the US ... @realDonaldTrump can watch the US economy grind to a halt and then the population might come to their senses and #ImpeachThePeach #USTradeWar
3146 2018-07-30 16:52:05 It’s been a stressful day in the oil change life

3148 2018-07-30 16:51:21 Alaska residents all get money from the state's oil sales, just like Kentucky residents with KFC, and Maine residents with Stephen King books.

3150 2018-07-30 16:51:15 Intressant f.ö. att högern är tyst om högerdiktaturer med extremt förtryck men skriker kommunism när folket revolterar. Alltid. Och att M kommer undan med sitt stöd till otaliga högerregimer genom åren. Från Pinochet m.fl. diktaturer i Sydamerika till Apartheid. Lundin Oil????
3151 2018-07-30 16:51:13 An independent Scotland would plunge Ruk into a double recession. Brexit hitting the GBP, and oil and gas reverting back to Scotland, will see WM  treasury struggle to pay its debt.
3152 2018-07-30 16:50:59 Tell them to use dirty oil to combat the African minch Guinea and go true them guys out they suffering with all them dead worms on them
3153 2018-07-30 16:50:53 Need to look closely at the laundering??? in Edmonton. 25 Somali murders in Edmonton in 5 yrs. #notworriedHussen blamed gov't funding 2012 op- ed. Treasure trove computer info msm: $10M per day laundered Somalia etal pirated that region Africa (oil ) .Canada was #3 destination .
3154 2018-07-30 16:50:44 The grid was charging me for the energy partly generated from oil and other fossil fuels. My solar panels charge me nothing, so I've no idea how oil is cheaper.
3155 2018-07-30 16:50:42 Every time I had an oil change at Toyota, they would find something wrong in the car that needs fixing. Instead of paying for an oil change, an additional $170 for cleaning the engine added to the estimates. Stop.
3156 2018-07-30 16:50:39 Too late you guys. Done with. You have a serious lemon problem with your engines. And dealers routinely tell owners that after 25,000 to 50,000 miles it's expected to burn oil.
3157 2018-07-30 16:50:26 I have some of the oil. My oncologist said not to do the THC which is why I thought your comment was interesting. He said CBD had the anticancer properties he'd recommend. I always forget to use it.
3158 2018-07-30 16:50:08 Mining exploitations in Africa, 56 US military interventions in S. America in the last century for Oil. These things dont help anyone but the profit makers.

3160 2018-07-30 16:49:50 Just waiting to drop my car off for an oil change before I wait for the oil to get changed.
3161 2018-07-30 16:49:42 I’ve had lupus since i was 12 and been given every pill possible, nothing worked, however, weed has been able to help me sleep even during the worst flares. It’s easier on your body and allows you to rest. If you’re still worried about trying it CBD oil has been able to help too
3162 2018-07-30 16:49:40 And Energy East would have been good for the whole country - including Que. The Maritimes wanted it to create wealth and jobs and would have refined the oil so we wouldn't have to import terrorist oil. What @HuffPostQuebec wants-Quebec gets. sickening

3171 2018-07-30 16:48:55 Are you really quoting 2012 in 2018? You might want to research Teck’s proposed mega project (Frontier) and Suncors expansion. Dying industry??? You wish. Also the renewable energy employment being greater than Oil and Gas has been debunked many times. Stop reading The Tyee

3178 2018-07-30 16:48:08 Economy correction starting to unravel, Arabians have a safety net with Gas and Oil to sustain the currency price instability.

Some prominent economists have warned that 2018-2019 we might experience a recession (with held is the crisis size).

Forward plan to lessen,ready?!
3179 2018-07-30 16:47:59 Don’t ask me how I’m doing until my coconut oil solidifies again
3180 2018-07-30 16:47:58 Crude oil $WTIC $CL up from its testing around 61.8% retrace down for support, now testing around a 50% retrace up plus $CL daily Bollinger Band midline as potential resistance. If higher, the area $71-72 would also be resistance to watch. Should help clue if indeed, it’s topped.
3181 2018-07-30 16:47:54 You’re kidding? The successors of Rockefeller (after SCOTUS broke Standard Oil monopy) went on to create the oligarchy that now buys US politicians for never ending wars in Middle East and S. America, and started neoliberalism. They cheapened the price of democracy for sure
3182 2018-07-30 16:47:38 Alternatives to pain meds are boswallia, green tea and fish oil.
3183 2018-07-30 16:47:33 Thanks for the suggestion!! I searched that up online & found out what that is,,
Is there's any alternative for it? (like cinnamon rolls in vanilla or rose oil with some rose petals) or anything else? cause I can't find Jezebel anywhere where I live
3184 2018-07-30 16:47:24 Chef Gusteau cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with toothpaste.

3186 2018-07-30 16:47:22 Hi Mo - you mention pipeline risks and GHG emissions. In an upcoming post, I will show how the oil and gas industry wrote NJ DEP pipeline review guidance. Even I was shocked by discovering that.

3193 2018-07-30 16:46:46 I'm so happy that my husband like India food and that nearly all the other restaurants gave us diarrhea( the oil where they cook with, vegetables weren't fresh etc) So we mostly eat my favorite when we eat outside. But I still say: "Home cooking is the best" And we both can cook
3194 2018-07-30 16:46:38 Hope you will explain that the refinery will be fed by oil wells in Niger Republic.
3195 2018-07-30 16:46:26 I think #JehangirTareen's name should be changed to #ToofanTareen. Will definitely increase #oil import bill for #July. Wondering why the #Dollar crashed?
3196 2018-07-30 16:46:26 It wasn't enough that we screwed everything up for you guys. We are "let's put Trump in office and go scorched earth on the US so there will be nothing left". It was like when Sadaam lit all the oil fields on fire when he was losing.
3197 2018-07-30 16:46:03 I’m not sure using mixes is actually cheaper? Eggs, oil etc have got to be added too? Maybe she is buying them in or someone is baking for her?
3198 2018-07-30 16:45:57 Y’all be careful with these snake oil salesmen out there.

3202 2018-07-30 16:45:30 I’ve used the organix argan oil mask. It was cool and all, my ends were super smooth but I feel like it just made the rest of it greasy with all the oils and stuff in it.
3203 2018-07-30 16:45:06 Do what Argentina did and stabilize currency first, remove 0s, exchange more oil for hard currency to build reserves, and keep banks fully capitalized
3204 2018-07-30 16:45:06 Atlantic and a little bit of the gulf... Destin and west of there... closer to MS and LA... ew... too much oil in the water.
3205 2018-07-30 16:44:53 but you won't wrinkle at a young age! Our oil control powder and Valley Girl foundation is great for oily skin types. We also have samples :)
3206 2018-07-30 16:44:51 What could be the cost of constructing a low capacity refinery plant at the source as compared to that hustle of bulk oil transport??

3226 2018-07-30 16:43:07 I can't quite follow your logic. Guinness is exported from Ireland in tanker ships, like oil. Trucks, like oil trucks, deliver some to NI for canning. It's a tiny instance of supply chains that go back and forth across the border and which face disruption and added costs.

3229 2018-07-30 16:42:44 Trying to decide if I should go to the gym tonight or rest. My hamstring is a little tender but it’s the only class I can fit in. Sigh. Sitting waiting for oil change.
3230 2018-07-30 16:42:37 Need to get a shower but oil tank has to be replaced so the only shower possible at the moment is the "I'm gonna stick you on an iceburgh and leave you there for a year shower which I just don't know if I can do it.

3233 2018-07-30 16:42:30 That's great news for Norwegian lungs, but fun fact, only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than Norway.
3234 2018-07-30 16:42:25 just use pure jojoba oil..a few drops. It mimics skins natural sebum.
3235 2018-07-30 16:42:08 Give me that snake oil.
3236 2018-07-30 16:41:46 Actually - I have a much better argument to counter this scourges we call @LFC - if your argument is oil money - call these blokes out - simply state - your either jealous of our club or a racist cause all the big clubs have money where ours comes from is a sore spot for them -

3241 2018-07-30 16:40:48 it would fuck up market gains. big oil runs this country
3242 2018-07-30 16:40:40 Ethanol. No one wants it except farmers and Econuts. We are the #1 global oil producer yet we are putting expensive junk in our fuel blends. Worse yet is we are subsidizing something we DON’T want!
3243 2018-07-30 16:40:30 Alberta has the third most oil reserves in the world, amassing Trillions of dollars, getting rid of equalization payments and federal tax will clear Alberta’s debt in a year.

3254 2018-07-30 16:39:26 Control the oil prices. Attack the Saudis for lying about oil output. You’re tax savings are been added to higher fuel cost. Recession coming soon with poor earnings from companies and fake economy numbers.

3264 2018-07-30 16:38:36 We needed a parts washer at work once but the co wouldnt buy one. So we got a few gallons of wd40, and a fiah tank air pump with a big air round air stone. Then we put it on a hot plate to warm the oil. It was incredible how well it worked. The bubbles adgitated the fluid.
3265 2018-07-30 16:38:30 Buy Ford & support Canadian economy, but buying foreign Oil is ok too !!!
3266 2018-07-30 16:38:26 Lmao, Harper didn’t cause the recession. Oil prices tanked again, what’s wonderboys done to help the stag-net 1.3 GDP? He is and will always be the worst PM ever.
3267 2018-07-30 16:38:09 Has anyone noticed a film on tea and coffee in the Dublin Area, Like it s oil based Has been happening some years now, would be interested if anyone else has the same problem
3268 2018-07-30 16:38:06 The Problem is the Oil & Energy companies.
I don't know who can handle them. 
They've been entrenched for a long time. 
and they seem to have an idea they can run to Mars
when they destroy Earth. 
Strange days, indeed.
3269 2018-07-30 16:38:01 Try a few drops of jojoba oil. It most closely mimics the skins natural sebum
3270 2018-07-30 16:37:57 The problem is also leaking oil products & cleaning chemicals that leach into the ground water

3276 2018-07-30 16:37:07 It will still go because India Rupees is flotation and connecting to US dollar ! Nz dollar was 76 us cents but now 67 cents. That’s why our oil effected
3277 2018-07-30 16:37:01 $USD 94.32 - 0.36

3286 2018-07-30 16:36:30 His description was very light to allow folks to imbue him with their imagination! He skin shed constant oil as if it was made of it (leaving a trail) and the only thing on him that isn't black are his eyes and mouth, glowing with a white smoke!

3288 2018-07-30 16:36:11 Been a lot of people pretending to be him. Next level attacks. He's no longer a joke; he's now becoming a multi-trillion dollar existential threat to oil and gas and car companies, not to mention he's wiping out the launch businesses of the ULA, ArianeSpace, and the Russians.
3289 2018-07-30 16:35:52 @LeBatardShow Lebatard looks like a used car salesman who asks the buyer to stop busting his balls when the buyer asks for free oil changes.
3290 2018-07-30 16:35:50 Every offshore oilfield I have ever worked in has significant natural oil and gas seeps (GOM, South China Sea, North Sea, Black Sea, Indian Ocean)

3292 2018-07-30 16:35:43 The oil company plans to boost deepwater oil production by over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, to more than 900,000 by 2020. This comes even as Shell ramps up shale activity in places like the Permian Basin.
3293 2018-07-30 16:35:40 That snake oil salesman...carnival barker in the oval office, is promoting that working-class Americans are rolling in cash.
People on social media are saying NO...not true.
Wages & cost of living.
People, are working 2 & 3 jobs to just LIVE.
Rent increases NATIONWIDE.

3297 2018-07-30 16:35:29 Shell gave the final green light to the Vito project in April, after slashing development costs by 70%. A month later it announced another deepwater oil discovery, also in the Gulf. This isn't a coincidence.
3298 2018-07-30 16:35:06 The biggest oil stocks were slow to join the shale boom, but they're ready to pounce on what soon could be the next bonanza: deepwater oil drilling. Crude prices can fall to $35 a barrel, less than half current levels and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) could profit off the Vito project
3299 2018-07-30 16:35:04 We need something like this for perennial grasses! FROM @BioeconomyLife & @Skogsindustrin "Everything that can be made from oil can be made from trees. #bioeconomy"

3303 2018-07-30 16:34:51 It is but I also have dry skin and I just used a hydrating primer and added a few drops of plain vitamin e oil to it and mixed it on the back of my hand before applying and it’s dewy
3304 2018-07-30 16:34:47 India is not pure capitalist economy, more like mixed. Banks and oil corps were once nationalized.  only after 1990s more capitalism has been adopted which resulted in great progress.
Who pays these journalists because I could use some money.
3305 2018-07-30 16:34:38 I got my hair braided & the girl was like pulling my hair when she parted it & gone say ...the reason it’s hurting is because I didn’t oil my scalp .  Then proceeds to ask me if I get perms ...like girl my hair is 4C & thick  & you’re pulling it ...

3309 2018-07-30 16:34:07 So, when Cannabis oil becomes legal for us to prescribe.  What conditions are we supposed to use it for? How do we avoid a scrum/free for all?
3310 2018-07-30 16:34:01 CHIBUKU PAPA !!  please keep that castor oil faaarr away.
3311 2018-07-30 16:33:55 I swear I have a neighbour whose gen is louder than the Trumpet of judgement day if you imagine it...they lock all their windows while others suffer... I plan to pour oil n water inside since they have refused to receive sense

3313 2018-07-30 16:33:44 few drops of jojoba oil (it mimics the skins natural sebum, therefore tricking the skin into NOT producing more oil!) Also, we make a great oil control powder. And we have samples available :)
3314 2018-07-30 16:33:40 I have that diffuser too and I love it! Though what I love most is that it looks like a glowing spaceship with the light on, less the oil diffussing.
3315 2018-07-30 16:33:38 Is my pics really my hair twisted or my hair twisted with some lint and oil buildup? Who knows
3316 2018-07-30 16:33:26 Olive oil does wonders for your beard and hair gentlemen.
3317 2018-07-30 16:33:19 The legal gray area will be clarified with the new farm bill.  For the record, I'm growing it here in Wisconsin though WI Hemp Pilot Program.  There are plenty of bad actors out there selling CBD oil though, so knowing your source is huge.
3318 2018-07-30 16:33:15 Try @pairdbeauty ! They have an amazing free oil free moisturizer and toner. You’d love it!
3319 2018-07-30 16:33:15 You know you work at a church when the other staff mistake your collection of coffee syrups for anointing oil.
3320 2018-07-30 16:32:57 Wow. Over the top. Never mind forcing NATO to pay up, guilting Germany with their Russian energy deal, ignore his arms to Ukraine, ignore forcing KSA to increase oil pumping. Etc  But, but, but he betrayed us.  Really!
3321 2018-07-30 16:32:55 Isn't there a risk that a jar might shatter when heated that high? Maybe if you used an oil bath it could work?
3322 2018-07-30 16:32:55 I’m pretty sure the guys at the oil changing place think I’m a stripper cause I just paid $70 in 5s & 1s
3323 2018-07-30 16:32:54 Hey Kris, I'm the founder of LA Minerals and also have oily skin. Nice part about that is you won't wrinkle as soon as your dry skin pals! But...in the mean time. I recommend washing with African black soap, witch hazel toner, and jojoba oil as a moisturizer.

Im insisting on a stripper at my party because you know, gratuitous nudityb& baby oil. I'm not growing up; no one can make me either!
3333 2018-07-30 16:32:22 You mean, "I'll distract the voters with rhetoric nonsense while the rich get  richer". You should offer your voters free medicare at the point of need, especially as America is such a rich nation. The richest 1% of Americans need a dose of castor oil!
3334 2018-07-30 16:32:16 I’m going to keep putting castor oil in my hair and twisted up cause I’m trying to grow my hair

Oh wait... Real have no owner either, nor Arab money and they spend less than Bayern since 2016. Oops.

3350 2018-07-30 16:30:20 Uh. It does work. Ever heard of US Interstate Highway System, Mass transit, Corporate Oil subsidies, Military Industry Subsidies? And the Army, Navy, Air Force Marines are social programs. It works if the public needs it. Stop being a corporate sheep. Bye Comrade.

3352 2018-07-30 16:30:14 GOM I'm going to assume is Gulf of Mexico

 That is true because if you look at the Gulf of Mexico it's shaped like a bowl

The Mississippi and other rivers around the Gulf have been dumping organic matter they are for eons

Oil and tar balls naturally come to the surface bottom
3353 2018-07-30 16:30:06 And yet, shockingly (), Trump lectured NATO members about not paying their dues - and Germany specifically about being in Russia's back pocket over oil and gas.

Neither of those things is pro-Russia!

Peel a sweet potato. Chop it into chunks to fries.
Toss in a bowl with 2 tbsp olive oil, sea salt, pepper, garlic seasoning, paprika.
Bake on a baking tray topped with foil for like 25-35 min @ 400-425 degrees.
Flip 1/2 way thru. ;o; SO GOOD.
3366 2018-07-30 16:27:55 Gang I made myself a doctor's appointment, got my oil changed, and have a freaking crockpot dinner started all by 10:30 IN THE MORNING is this adulting??
3367 2018-07-30 16:27:54 Sanders should be selling Snake Oil
3368 2018-07-30 16:27:50 Heartbreaking, what happened to the children and their grandmother (and others) in Redding. Why is it so easy to run filthy oil pipelines all over, yet the life-promoting (and SAVING!) natural resource WATER is so scarce when needed? Oil spills, it’s a MESS. Water spills, SOGGY!

3373 2018-07-30 16:26:47 You're absolutely right. We need to keep demand high for oil derivatives. Just think of all the people that depend on the oil industry for their livelihoods.
3374 2018-07-30 16:26:39 Let's not forget, though, that oil wealth is not an end in itself. The doors it unlocks for Guyana depends on the people managing it, and their ability to harness the skills of Guyanese, and others in the field, to develop prudent and transparent plans/programs.
3375 2018-07-30 16:26:38 Nobody told me part of growing up was making plans to get your oil changed with your s/o
3376 2018-07-30 16:26:26 I’m just trying to make a face scrub and my dog is trying to eat it. I didn’t even put in the good stuff like the sugar or essential oils yet. It was literally castor oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin e oil and she’s over here acting like I’m cooking a turkey or something.
3377 2018-07-30 16:26:19 @realDonaldTrump I THINK YOU ARE A GREAT  BUT I HAVE A PROLBEM WITH THE COST OF HEATING OIL.  I AM PISS OFF AT THE COST PEOPLE CAN NOT KEEP PAYING THAT PRICE WE HAVE A LOT OF OIL WE NEED THE PRICE TO COME DOWN I AM A DISABLED VETERAN I AM NOT A MILLIONAIRE PLEASE

3389 2018-07-30 16:24:54 If you look closely at the portrait of Ginevra de Benci you can see Da Vinci’s fingerprint in the oil and hear the sound of the guard yelling “THAT’S TOO CLOSE SIR! TWELVE INCHES, NO CLOSER!”  #Smithsonian
3390 2018-07-30 16:24:50 Don’t forget, those fries are cooked in vegetable oil. Not nearly as tasty since they switched from beef tallow to a less saturated fat.
3391 2018-07-30 16:24:47 @EBischoff love the show! Would it be cool to ask what kind of Yerba Mate you prefer? I want to try that mixture of coconut oil and butter, I think it was, you said on the show today?
3392 2018-07-30 16:24:46 Coconut oil, a little bit of heavy whipping cream, and a little bit of butter. 

I was weary of the taste but the coconut helped a lot. I feel good so far I’m not hangry lol
3393 2018-07-30 16:24:44 It’s amazing to me that someone really took a chicken, covered it in flower, and put it in hot oil. God bless you
3394 2018-07-30 16:24:43 Watching the guy  @canadiantire changing my oil right now is the most anxiety I’ve experienced in months...
3395 2018-07-30 16:24:43 I remember when the doctor told me na “bawal lahat unless olive oil yung gamit at grilled yung fish yung pagkain”

3396 2018-07-30 16:24:37 Just decided that since tomatoes are in season, I'm going to buy all I can carry from the farmer's market, slow roast them w/ sea salt, thyme, and olive oil and fill my freezer with them for the future.
3397 2018-07-30 16:24:23 Make sure to hydrate your skin! Mattifying products only work short term and will increase oiliness in the long run by dehydrating your skin so your skin produces more oil! Use a matte primer with a natural foundation, hydrating primer with matte foundation etc!
3398 2018-07-30 16:24:18 But remember Rudy said"I don't think that Colluding with Russia is a Crime" and what that GOLLUM  says , just like the Snake Oil Salesman we have in the WH.. His "Feces Throwing" TRUMPANZEES  Will believe ..

3408 2018-07-30 16:23:24 I’ve actually been having the same problem! I’m normally super oily and in the past I’ve tried to reduce that by using mattifying products but that makes it worse! That will over produce that sebum (oil) in your skin

3415 2018-07-30 16:22:32 I agree there’s a lot of Kool-Aid flavored snake oil out there, we need to base instruction from sound research, etc. Can the opposite be taken too far though? Should teachers be afraid to adapt/innovate because they don’t have a tit-for-tat study of a new method they can cite?
3416 2018-07-30 16:22:32 As a former Geology student, I can only hope that no one asks you how geologists find oil sources deep within the earth. (Hint: Lasers won't work.)

3423 2018-07-30 16:21:43 Hey, if a politician gets a $10,000 bribe per oil rig, isn’t it worth it?  

If you want to avoid the oil rigs, get Dana Rohrabacher out of office.

3425 2018-07-30 16:21:26 It’s a rainy day here in OC if you don’t have much to get into because it’s to wet on the beach call or stop on in for an oil change or just some routine maintenance to make sure your car is ready to go another “million” as they say! :)

3464 2018-07-30 16:16:16 The Iran nuclear issue only serves as a pretext, in order to justify American-led Western aggression. What the US really desires is oil and the complete control of China's One Belt One Road East-West economic corridor, which passes through the heart of Iran.

3473 2018-07-30 16:15:51 I think those have already begun.  Iraq is probably nothing short of a war for the oil fields there.  I'm sure it won't stop with oil though.  Perhaps Russia making a play for the USA is actually trying to get the 'bread basket' for themselves.

3487 2018-07-30 16:14:46 And as for Saudi Arabia, I don’t think the British Govt should be involved. But oil and security means we have to be. But here is the difference, Corbyn chooses to support violent regimes The Govt only does it out of the needs of the Country.
3488 2018-07-30 16:14:45 We need younger people to run.

3489 2018-07-30 16:14:38 For me oil size is more traditional and I feel it gives a better finish as it has more time to flatten out any brush marks. Always seal porous objects, wood, gesso etc with shellac or button polish before putting on the size. You don't need to if it's metal.

3494 2018-07-30 16:14:07 Global warming IS a thing, so alternative energy must become much more prevalent.  NM's natural gas is less polluting than oil so will be a great resource for the state.  Any governor will support its sale.  #NOPearce4NM #dumpTrump

3507 2018-07-30 16:13:14 Even the pipes that deliver water to your house are made of oil that was delivered via pipes and pipelines. It’s the safest, cleanest and most efficient method to transport oil so you can use it in thousands of different ways.

3547 2018-07-30 16:09:05 Cbd oil is great for mood problems tbh, lowers inflammation in the brain allegedly 
3548 2018-07-30 16:09:04 Damm!!! I guess I was too early to ship out the oil as the post office wasnt open yet!! Back in an hour!
3549 2018-07-30 16:08:59 Ummm, in 2014, oil prices almost universally plummeted, and Russia faced a similar economic crisis..
3550 2018-07-30 16:08:46 @realDonaldTrump with the cont'd interest rate hike THREATS, price per barrel of oil increase THREATS, social media shadowing our freedom of speech THREATS, false narrative MEDIA THREATS, the Silent Majority keeps GROWING! :) keep up the great leadership Mr. President!
3551 2018-07-30 16:08:45 Albeit at the expense of the US auto, agricultural, aviation, high tech and wine industries which are seeing declining sales abroad already...  and specialized steel pipes needed for our oil industry but not made anywhere in the US can’t be imported now at reasonable costs

3553 2018-07-30 16:08:32 We all know these terrible fires and floods are caused by climate change, which in turn is caused by politicians and corporations who are terrified of free power - who drill for oil everywhere and thwart the change to solar. #DontBlameGod. Blame the #GreedyBastards. Vote 'em out!
3554 2018-07-30 16:08:23 Iraq should have enough oil to supply their energy, no?
3555 2018-07-30 16:08:18 Love salsa with ..cherry tomatoes, basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar , salt n pepper .
3556 2018-07-30 16:08:13 Oil producing States? give them cattle ranches

Cattle producing States? give them refinary

State Elections? send 30,000 police

State Killings? send 1000 police

IPOB? label them terrorists 

Killer herdsmen? label them foreigners

my own is to post - kalu aja
3557 2018-07-30 16:08:06 @MBuhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo State an oil rich state and on the other hand wants to build a refinery in Katsina State, a cattle rearing state... 
Yet a lot of people do not see anything wrong with this...

3560 2018-07-30 16:07:51 The chart seeks to summarise the crude oil revenue by successive administrations in Nigeria.
3561 2018-07-30 16:07:43 The answer is that govt shouldn’t be doing this in the first place because there is no guaranteed crude supply. Except Savanna Petroleum makes commercial discovery, which is uncertain. And Savannah will eventually choose the best export route if they discover oil commercially.
3562 2018-07-30 16:07:38 indeed we did. we are still trying to source the lederhosen with unicorn motives on it, the baby oil, and the spanking paddles for you
3563 2018-07-30 16:07:08 Fermented Fish oil on the ponds and standing water where they breed! Off spray to keep them away! Raid for the flyers! And the commercially available bug zapping light traps are good too! NO to MagnumPI and all things CBS! no matter how much the bugs attack! #SaveScorpion

3585 2018-07-30 16:04:35 You would have to explain why only venezuela collapsed when every other oil producer flourished.
3586 2018-07-30 16:04:30 Personally, I am surprised at the relief I get from Excedrin and also Bayer Back & Body. 

Gabapentin gives some relief, but makes me loopy and I saw an article on its effects on the old brainerama.

Still makes me think CBD Oil or Weed products are the way to go. Need 2 legalize
3587 2018-07-30 16:04:15 GREEDY OIL COMPANIES!! I get  with just the mentioned of Scott Pruitt's name? Im hoping everything he ha done can be reversed. What he did is WRONG!!!!! Taking out critical information to benefit the CROOKS he does business with.
3588 2018-07-30 16:04:08 @realDonaldTrump Gasoline price per gallon has been the most expensive under Trump than for any president in his first two years in office.  Trump is weak, big oil and the Arabs brush Trump aside and dismiss him while they make huge profits price gouging the American people
3589 2018-07-30 16:04:03 Than why did every other oil producing country make money during that time period including the US?

3595 2018-07-30 16:02:43 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to the Boston Redsox. We won't even miss it!
3596 2018-07-30 16:02:35 Things I have learned in the last 10 minutes scrolling through Twitter, after missing it all day:
#Brexit - we're still fucked

#MCFC - oil cunts
#Rain - apparently we had some
#Puppies - there's always puppies

3598 2018-07-30 16:02:24 Oil revenues have to be reinvested in industries that are viable. Agriculture is one of those. We have a small consumer market based on our population size but we have the land capacity to grow and export ...

3604 2018-07-30 16:01:58 1. Trump moaned that Germany buys gas and oil from Russia. So what? Many other countries do the same. 
2. Why would Obama interfere in the business dealings of other countries?
3. Obama isn't president.
4. Why, in your own words, do you think Obama has 'Russian interests'?

3635 2018-07-30 15:58:14 You pay for services everywhere, getting your hair done, oil changed, car washed & don’t argue w/those prices. When out to eat why is it not an obligation to leave a tip? If a restaurant were to automatically put a gratuity you’d be upset. You’re obviously a shitty tipper.

3680 2018-07-30 15:53:53 Coconut oil..  RT @NaturallyTyraG: Mannnnnn
3681 2018-07-30 15:53:52 I never really thought of people touching an oil painting before, but I like that image.

(Also, I am voting 'Ebenezer' Best Mastiff Name of All Time.)
3682 2018-07-30 15:53:48 Finally got my oil change scheduled. Worst part of working M-F is finding time to do shit like this!

3686 2018-07-30 15:53:02 Tidur bege udah make oil oilan malah twitteran
3687 2018-07-30 15:52:59 Let me go get an oil change.
3688 2018-07-30 15:52:52 Why does my oil have to be the most expensive oil to change 
3689 2018-07-30 15:52:51 why must castor oil be so good for my hair but smell soooo baddddd
3690 2018-07-30 15:52:47 Like $NOV  $36.5P if oil loses momentum. Cheap play could yield some good returns
3691 2018-07-30 15:52:46 Snake oil salesman.
3692 2018-07-30 15:52:39 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.01% #DAX -0.48% #CAC -0.37% #Estoxx50 -0.38% #GBPUSD 1.3144 #EURGBP 0.8912 #Gold 0.02% #Oil 1.82%
3693 2018-07-30 15:52:18 Afiq nak drop oil&fat sebab takkenal sorang pun dalam kelas hm kelas cancel pun taktahu tetiba ada grouplab pun taktahu hm i guess member itu penting hm ambik subj tu nanti sem 4 la afiq :)
3694 2018-07-30 15:52:17 Salmon and feta go together like gun oil and a lonley hand.  So good.
3695 2018-07-30 15:52:12 Prick! And you can take that how you want. I bet you're such an oil painting..
3696 2018-07-30 15:52:03 Look to Venezuela, with huge oil reserves and a crumbling economy to see how beautiful it is.
3697 2018-07-30 15:51:47 Well you are wrong.When I worked at Syncrude in the 80s it took one bbl (equivalent) of natural gas to produce one bbl of crude. Zero net energy production. 30 years later it takes about one bbl to produce 5 bbl of crude.A big improvement but still among dirtiest oil in the world
3698 2018-07-30 15:51:39 Venezuela’s economic collapse came from a plummet in oil prices. It had to do with an over-dependence on oil and not enough domestic-production in food.
3699 2018-07-30 15:51:31 I can now successfully change the engine oil and plug of my generator
3700 2018-07-30 15:51:06 The other day at a restaurant, my mom ordered a “what’s that martini called with extra olive oil in it?”
3701 2018-07-30 15:51:02 I have just been informed that my shift is covered for tonight and all day tomorrow. Should we drive to Pittsburgh @AronAronarriaga I'm getting an oil change right now

3709 2018-07-30 15:50:32 @Sears Auto Center of #PuertoRico is the worst! For a oil change arrive at 9:26am it is 11:45am still waiting. Not fair for anyone you have to see the old people waiting. #Unbelievable #unfair and the employee only said I don't have the control.

3723 2018-07-30 15:49:19 In addition Tim the internal combustion engine will still be powering vehicles at comparative prices 100 years from now. Oil will be plentiful and the Western World can’t site or build enough electrical plants/Lines NIMBY. A non cobalt storage ceramic is still 35/50 years away.
3724 2018-07-30 15:49:17 Your Twitter feed is PROVES this to be true. Nothing debunked here! The self described “pragmatic environmentalist” lobbying FOR the Trans Mountain Pipeline and a 7X’s increase in oil tankers through Metro Vancouver for the purpose of selling oil to Asia for the oil companies!
3725 2018-07-30 15:49:10 Makes me wonder what they put in it  you know we have to side eye anything they say at this point
3726 2018-07-30 15:48:58 Y’all need to be as confident as my Uber driver. Out here doing trips acting like her check engine, oil, and gas light aren’t all on.

3736 2018-07-30 15:47:30 Guyana's most important resource is its people, not oil. The country will benefit significantly if oil wealth is used to invest heavily in its people, and to develop social services and systems that are lacking; oil wealth should not be concentrated in the hands of a few.

3746 2018-07-30 15:46:28 found out that if I put off getting my oil changed long enough, my dad will get me the oil and filter and only hate me just a little bit more than usual 
3747 2018-07-30 15:46:24 and not every manager gets what they want all the time! people like you have only started thinking the way you do now because of City and PSG with the oil money! Juventus haven't spent massively or Bayern they have very very good sides still!

Mankind uses gold? And crude oil? Yet those are also traded as comodities. Why would the paralel with utility tokens stop with utilisation?
3763 2018-07-30 15:45:20 umm...no. It's never been a priority of the GOP. Bush 43 was in deep with the energy industry going back to his failed career as a Texas oil man when he lived in Midland.
3764 2018-07-30 15:45:14 Right, though it’s of the same makeup, which I was wondering. I could certainly whip some up w/coconut oil. This is such a crappy place to be :-(

3817 2018-07-30 15:41:24 In Italy a friend of mine used to slice them very thinly (like mandolin thin) and then cooked them down very slowly in olive oil until they were all broken down - add some very lightly sautéed garlic and serve with penne and loads of Parmesan and black pepper. It was delicious.

3826 2018-07-30 15:40:22 You were talking about socialism. This guy is the PM of a capitalist country. You know that, right? The most recent country that tried socialism is Venezuela.

3873 2018-07-30 15:34:40 There is no stranded crude in Niger. All of the current 20k bpd production goes to the local Soraz refinery. The 2013 proposed phase 2 development by CNPC to increase daily production to ~80/90k did not go ahead after the oil price crash. It’s still in the works.

3878 2018-07-30 15:34:11 No, you don’t. All Canada would have to do is stop selling you oil and it would be disastrous for the US. The influx of offshore oil imports would drive the cost so high it would impact most Americans. The US is not a self-sufficient country.

You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use oil that is capable of extended mileage changes. Most importantly change your engine oil often enough

3952 2018-07-30 15:28:15 I use an essential oil toner after I’ve washed my face, then I use vitamin E oil to cover my face. By adding oil to your face it slows down the production of your natural oils. It’s helped me so Much! Especially in the humidity!

3955 2018-07-30 15:27:43 Those are the few town folk that gather 'round the "snake oil" salesman when he rolls into their village. They get suckered into buying the Miracle Tonic to cure all your ails, and will claim it heals them as they lay dying from tuberculosis.

3964 2018-07-30 15:26:47 I love rose hip oil after a light cleanser. I rarely wear face makeup and used to wash my face a lot but it seemed to make my skin produce more oil so I backed off washing my face as much

You’re lobbying hard FOR 7X’s increase in oil tanker traffic through an area we have very little oil tanker traffic, increasing the likelihood of spills, fires and other oil transport related incidents, putting the lives of those who depend on the sea at risk.

4001 2018-07-30 15:23:51 It helps to fight oil with oil. When your skin is oily that means it’s lacking moisture! I suggest @BahiCosmetics sunflower oil it’s done wonders for me!! Also setting your makeup w translucent powder helps thru out the day

4015 2018-07-30 15:22:09 So one should throw the bread and olive oil away after one use?
If that's the case, you should include $20 for cost of the toaster, a couple of bucks for silverware and plate, and a few thousand dollars to bring in electricity.

4044 2018-07-30 15:19:18 oil is not moisture to hair. it's more like a lubricant. it has its purpose but it does not give your hair the moisture it needs. it's more like lotion to dry skin. lotion doesn't heal dry skin, it just helps camoflauge it better.
4045 2018-07-30 15:19:14 And that was just for changing over to a resusableenergy source. That means kiss good bye tocoal miners, the oil industry, nat. gas etc. which would throw this country back into a recession prob worse than we have ever seen. What a friggin IDIOT. #NeverOcasio

5. Recession sets in as the bubble bursts.

We don't need to obfuscate the issue, we're simply "sharing the science, facts" of Canadian energy right?

4091 2018-07-30 15:13:42 I do not work at a “gas station”. I work at a high end convenient store that specializes in the sale of petroleum oil thank you very much.
4092 2018-07-30 15:13:39 What does the Secretary have to say about Canada seeing its Oil sold at less than World Prices? This has to do with Americans agitating to prevent pipelines from being built in Canada. Those pipelines will result in Canada having more than one customer. @allnews2nite @lamphieryeg
4093 2018-07-30 15:13:27 I gotchuuuu! Pues sí, como están hechos (en su mayoría) de oil based products, they  can clog pores and trap bacteria. It can cause breakouts or make acne worse :/
4094 2018-07-30 15:13:20 I need to get a registration sticker, brakes, & new tires. And I already know that synthetic oil change isn’t far behind

4097 2018-07-30 15:13:03 CBD oil is the only thing that works for me.
4098 2018-07-30 15:13:03 This morning my mom woke me@up telling me there was a little mouse stuck on a glue trap in the kitchen and to wait for him to die t throw him away. I waited for her to leave to pour veg oil on his feet so he could escape outside.  be free friend!

4100 2018-07-30 15:12:53 Save our energy sector? I hope you mean renewable energy. Because saving the oil and gas sector means LITERALLY killing our children’s hope of a livable future. I know which I’d prefer to keep.
4101 2018-07-30 15:12:51 Solid race for sure, but have to love the fact that you can tell how frustrated he is to "only" finish P2. Going to be/is already a major contender in this series.

4103 2018-07-30 15:12:35 Giuliani is like the snake oil salesman! He thinks he can help Trump wangle his way out of his misdeeds! No amount of lies will work! We will NOT accept constant lying as the new normal! Trump is accountable for all bad actions, immorality and lies!
4104 2018-07-30 15:12:23 Very much true. Our laziness is as a result of oil money. It makes us see not beyond our noses.
4105 2018-07-30 15:12:22 People who opened Cyber cafe's back in the 90's, 2000 felt like they struck oil well.

4110 2018-07-30 15:11:48 What is CBD oil. I never manage to sleep more that 2 hours at a time. Have suffered with insomnia for about 20 years.
4111 2018-07-30 15:11:46 Not when big oil is still controlling the world. They have done things to slow down progress of green energy. We have the ability to get off the grid individually and as communities meaning we produce all our own food, energy, and water but we are still so heavily reliant on oil

4113 2018-07-30 15:11:35 About what? How it's been scientifically proven that we can power the country with a mix of wind, solar, and biofuels if we conpletely got rid of coal or oil? (Preferably coal. Oil doesn't polute QUITE the way it does.)
4114 2018-07-30 15:11:29 Khamenei’s dual approach includes threatening the oil shipments of other countries in the region. He stated at a gathering of Iranian diplomats and officials from the Foreign Ministry that “if Iran’s oil export is blocked, no other country in the region will export oil either.”
4115 2018-07-30 15:11:27 holy hell I almost forgot the stove was on with a pan of oil on it for like 15 minutes thank you spidey senses for not letting me burn my house down

4128 2018-07-30 15:09:56 Sanctions on Iran decreases world's crude oil availability
4129 2018-07-30 15:09:56 national security is important. but, in the name of security no money should be wasted.
why India reduces buying oil from Iran?
US urging us to stop the oil  of Iran purchases.
that is more cost effective.
4130 2018-07-30 15:09:55 Oye tattu. They have plenty other country to sell their oil. But imagine if they stop selling to india. 84% oil india imports from middle east.
4131 2018-07-30 15:09:42 you goin to the Mary Geren thing?  Can you pick me up?  I mean you *don't have to* since I know it isn't even my district!!!   But all these ppl asking me to go and my car still sucks big time.  

Oil leak has been up(down?)graded to "excessive"... lol
4132 2018-07-30 15:09:30 An independent Scotland would plunge Ruk into a double recession,  due to Brexit, and lost of oil and gas, add them plus products exported through English ports.  That's the reason why , all the unionists party's would let it go
4133 2018-07-30 15:09:22 Few disagree that KSA reserves are probably much smaller than advertised. Reserves not a static number but a volume at a price & few countries follow this but rather, report some version of a resource estimate. 

Higher oil price is also a key factor in KSA IPO decision.

4138 2018-07-30 15:08:58 It’s OK to unmask Trump campaign officials as he(they) are snake oil salespeople & interest is to protect country from their perfidy. At least that’s what Clapper, Brennan, Comey & others say. Congress oversight neutered so hard to determine what Obamacare folks been doing to us.

4148 2018-07-30 15:07:56 Hate to go to the Car Dealer free oil change but they always find something else wrong.
4149 2018-07-30 15:07:54 Food for thought.

Buhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with our leaders?

4166 2018-07-30 15:06:47 Shut down Afghanistan, evacuate Syria, disappear from the Baltics, and push up oil prices with unresolved conflicts in the Middle East.

4168 2018-07-30 15:06:40 This type of thing is why car insurance and home insurance continues to remain cost effective... They don't cover oil changes and routine maintenance, which are paid for in a market. They cover catastrophe.

4178 2018-07-30 15:05:52 Are you saying that oil and gas is not a natural resource that we as a country do not have a national and state security interest in?

Without Oil and Gas there will be critical shortages of EVERYTHING and the cost of EVERYTHING will increase expotentially...

Think about that!

4181 2018-07-30 15:05:29 It is lazy. It doesn't take into consideration a litany of other factors that led to their demise. They had been socialist for decades under Chavez and nobody cared but they were oil rich. Then came their oil decline coupled with bad government management.
4182 2018-07-30 15:05:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4183 2018-07-30 15:05:09 Great to see a UK company doing it's bit with recycling technologies doing some great stuff turning ocean plastic into oil!  Environmental sustainability is no longer a tick box and is taken more and more seriously.  These companies are doing some great work.

I need more beard oil. It feels like a ridiculous luxury, but it's the only thing that cuts down on snarls and ingrown hairs.
4186 2018-07-30 15:04:48 story time: i was driving to class & a light on my dashboard turned on. i called my dad and tell him the oil light came on & he tells me to get some oil at a gas station and basically that if i don’t i will screw up my car. note that i have an exam and 20 minutes until class

4190 2018-07-30 15:04:33 It was minging when I saw him on Saturday, I have cleaner boiler suits after an oil change
4191 2018-07-30 15:04:28 It will stop when world is free of Middle East oil dependency.
Flow of money is through oil surplus coming as donations to fake jihadists.
if you commute in car like me? Then we are all contributing to some extent to this by feeding middle east oil economies and so terrorists.

4194 2018-07-30 15:04:20 You can't go to heaven through the old temple(fasting, anointing oil,water baptism, tithing etc) because it was destroyed since it was not taking people to heaven. The only way to heaven is through Christ Jesus.
4195 2018-07-30 15:04:19 obulshit gave away bunch islands two russia in oil billons oh you convently forget that most of this stuff happened on his watch
4196 2018-07-30 15:04:11 Oil hasn't featured in the UK economic make up for quite a few years, UK is not reliant on it. The economy grew by 17% since 2010 which includes record highs and deficits for oil and gas income.
4197 2018-07-30 15:04:10 So much of what we call 'capital' today, isn't. I wouldn't tax capital at all, but the definition of capital is 'those things, created by labor, which aid labor'. Not land, not oil/iron/etc, not IP, not natural monopolies.
4198 2018-07-30 15:04:01 should smell like mangoes, mustard and sesame oil (maybe some chilli).

4201 2018-07-30 15:03:55 The benefits of cannabis outweigh the negatives. Research proves that it’s a powerful and healing plant. No need to even get high if you take CBD Oil with federally legal thc levels. Can’t wait until it’s completely legal so that those in pain can benefit from the healing.
4202 2018-07-30 15:03:32 Why do we import oil? I’m genuinely curious I’ve never looked into it.
4203 2018-07-30 15:03:29 I meant that he's owned by people that own yachts.  Everybody that joins tRUmpland gets a bone(DeVos=destroy education, Zinke=oil and mining cronyism, etc.)  I was speculating that he's anti-PoC, anti-poor and probably wears a hood and jackboots on Saturday night.
4204 2018-07-30 15:03:25 @altonbrown says to spritz a bit of vegetable oil on the paper. I’ve been doing that for years. If you’re using a smaller chimney, it helps keep the paper lit longer so you don’t have to add another piece. I just bought a full sized chimney.
4205 2018-07-30 15:03:20 that sucks dude
4206 2018-07-30 15:03:15 Who can guarantee Chinese public security? Who can guarantee things like Sanlu milk powder, reuse of waste oil and toxic vaccines will never happen again? Who can save public confidence if Ms.Gao is just sentenced in prison for several years and still wealthy?

4216 2018-07-30 15:01:56 I think Twitter thinks they are important to the point where they should censor us?  Ever heard of of the SEC and anti- trust act you are looking at old people in Congress and think “ignorance “ beware ever heard of standard oil? Or ATT

4222 2018-07-30 15:01:30 I agree. Argentina has more resources to utilize where Venezuela was relying solely on oil. Truthfully, the leaders and corruption...

how many new wars started while you were President,

how many US weapons you sold for peace, and sent for terrorists,

how many more oil do US citizens need,

how many months now since Flint water issue,

how many Poor People's Campaign tweets?

Long story short, it lasted 2 minutes bc it made me wanna puke. I couldnt breathe bc my nose is stuffed with mucus. And my tongue got tired.
4282 2018-07-30 14:55:18 Fuck therapy. It’s awkward and doesn’t accomplish shit for nightmares. The only thing that helped me was CBD oil every night and not eating for at least 2 hours before falling asleep. Even if you understand why you’re having the dream you’ll still have it. So cbd. Try it.
4283 2018-07-30 14:55:12 i’ve hardly read any of it but the general basis is it that city are a “oil club” even though you’d be happy if the same thing happened to you if you was in their situation

As a producer I can spot that they didn’t use footage, they created the footage, so they placed a baby duck in the substance. Was it oil? Probably not, but regardless, dick move.
4363 2018-07-30 14:44:48 UK industrial production has generally risen since we joined the EU. It fell in the early 70s (oil crisis), early 80s (Thatcher), early 90s (Major) and after 2008 (Fin Crisis). None of these anything to do with the EU. Even Minford thinks no deal Brexit would be worse.

4381 2018-07-30 14:42:36 On the bright side: I got my car home from the mechanic. On the not-so-bright side, it started making weird rattling noises, the oil light started flashing and then loads of smoke came out of the bonnet. Back to square one, I fear.
4382 2018-07-30 14:42:35 @HondaCarland Talk about #pricegouging! I call 4 a price for an oil change and am not only told it’s “$54.04” 4 my 15 yr old car, but then I’m lied to with being told that “synthetic is what the car calls for”. Really!?! 1st I’ve heard of that since I bought it new. #LostMyBiznes
4383 2018-07-30 14:42:30 @Varneyco @cvpayne You could throw the bum off the air, 120$ barrel of oil?  Never again will be suffient, and "years" to build the infrastructure not under #trump2016.  People need to pay attention to the new paradigm.

4389 2018-07-30 14:42:14 I wonder what Maggie is thinking...
Regardless of your political position, left or right, the midnight raid and confiscation of a lawyer’s materials will have reprecussions extending into the future and spreading like flammable oil on water toward a police state.
4390 2018-07-30 14:42:06 Ok. After extracting oil the oil cakes are fed to cows . In tamil it is called Paruththi kottai punnakku (cotton seed oilcake ).

4424 2018-07-30 14:38:54 Socialism!=printing money. See 20s Germany, civil war USA and Zimbabwe for examples of hyperinflation ;). General economic collapse leads to it, and I'll again point to the clear evidence the current economic collapse is more  linked to corruption and oil prices.
4425 2018-07-30 14:38:50 @cvpayne John isn't taking into account Anwar.
He is also not considering OPEC.
He doesn't consider the shift in energy consumption to NG would push Oil prices DOWN not UP. 
He is also not very bright.

4448 2018-07-30 14:36:57 Yes  ... you can even make a peppermint ant spray w/ 3 parts peppermint oil to 1 each of part citronella and lavender oils mixed with water and alcohol.  I use cayenne or cinnamon on mounds outside. They carry it back to the queen. We have a horrid fire ant issue here.
4449 2018-07-30 14:36:33 To handle its oil resources they have to 1. Retain as much technical experts between now and 2020 - since that is when production is scheduled to begin - to both advise them and manage and regulate local institutions responsible for the sector.

4516 2018-07-30 14:28:28 We need Restorative justice AND resources in our Schools to keep youth away from drugs, gangs and crime!  Time for those that suck out the black gold (crude oil) and natural gas to pay 7% GPT, shut up, and enjoy the beauty of living in this State!

4524 2018-07-30 14:27:38 Thanks Vidyaratha, can you explain more via tweet why you think it is contradictory that Guyana was a signatory of the climate change agreement but is working with Exxon Mobil on their oil deal? In what ways might this be difficult for Guyana's environment and biodiversity?

4527 2018-07-30 14:27:26 In Exodus 32:22 we see God telling Moses to make anointing oil which was not supposed to be poured on foreigners. No one was supposed to make any other oil when it was finished. The anointing of the new covenant is not physical with oil. Christ was anointed by the Holy spirit.

4545 2018-07-30 14:24:18 Politicians regularly criticize industries like banking, big oil, insurance, private equity, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, education, gun makers, the NFL, etc. Why should journalism be off limits... especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking?
4546 2018-07-30 14:24:10 3...in the employment market. These things are sufficient to discourage politicians, especially those linked to the oil industry in some way or invested finance, from making the right choices on shifting from renewables from fossil. Same reason electric cars are only just getting
4547 2018-07-30 14:24:07 People aren’t leaving NYC either, and it gets balls cold there - or we could follow the lead of economic power houses like Oklahoma and Kansas and bankrupt ourselves so oil tycoons can take home a little more cash so they won’t raise wages for labor
4548 2018-07-30 14:23:55 city started it all with oil money
4549 2018-07-30 14:23:54 Yes because the US did not enter the war in 1939, they chose to wait and sold oil and other goods to the NAZI's.

IBM even sold the machines to process the Jews like fucking cattle.

The numbers related to IBM machines.

4564 2018-07-30 14:22:46 Haha. Tough to say. Good reasons for market consensus on hike (core inflation, MSP, oil, rupee depreciation). I still feel there is a chance that the MPC might wait till Oct for more data. Whatever the decision, I don't think the governor will have to use his casting vote! 
4565 2018-07-30 14:22:44 Clean sources like Saudi Arabia? Yeah let's buy oil instead of developing our own resources.

4571 2018-07-30 14:21:49 Agreed.  If you want more movement, try castor oil.

4573 2018-07-30 14:21:24 Venezuela is a cautionary tale to heed if Guyana relies solely on oil revenue and doesn't: 1- push economic diversification (especially reinfuse agriculture sector) 2- use the opportunity to attract foreign and regional investment 3- engage the ~1million Guyanese in the diaspora

4593 2018-07-30 14:19:09 Yep. It’s in line with my auto maintenance theory of healthcare. Insurance doesn’t pay for your oil change or to change the wipers. The fact their are thousand competing for that business keeps prices reasonable.

4596 2018-07-30 14:18:59 Correct... but unfortunately for competitive Bowling, all the “blue oil” on earth isn’t going to teach most people the difference between pros and “Mr 250 League wall master blaster.”  I wish that wasn’t the case, but it would be easier if the top league averages were about 215.

4614 2018-07-30 14:16:31 keep it that way.  It's incredibly painful to watch and a disservice to those who actually cook with cannabis.  Its just a regular cooking show where they add a few drops of prepared cannabis tincture/oil.  There's no use of the flavor profile, or of unique preperation methods

4616 2018-07-30 14:16:30 What puzzles me is that you don't have to go back to the 40s to find a national emergency. I was a baby during the oil crisis and the three day week. My best guess is that no one is invoking that because blame fell overwhelmingly on Ted Heath and his government.

4646 2018-07-30 14:13:12 The £469B. It's 3 times Scotland's total annual GDP and would put per capita GDP up to around $150,000, so obviously wrong. More likely to be the figure for cumulative total NS oil revenues since production began.

4651 2018-07-30 14:12:26 Trump is on a path of destroying America! Tariffs, eliminating any legislation that Obama enacted, allows chemical pollutants to be dumped into our rivers, destroys our national parks by not maintaining them & sells oil drilling rights next to them & national monuments.

4849 2018-07-30 13:49:56 I love roasted cauliflower. Mix with seasoning and a little oil, and bake at a high heat until slightly blackened, and turned once or twice. It works with frozen cauli, defrosted (or not). It absorbs seasoning beautifully, so it can pretty much taste like anything you're craving

Remove it from the electric food processor, scoop out the oil dough with a metal spoon

4893 2018-07-30 13:44:55 Commodities/oil the only market in the world where the biggest buyer is forced to use the currency of a rival (& possible enemy) to pay for commodities.  Perhaps this situation will persist forever.  Seems unlikely, esp since China's moving aggressively to end it.

Please, in the name of gastronomical coherence, stop saying "garlic aioli". Allioli (which is how it's originally written) literally means "garlic and oil" in catalan.

4957 2018-07-30 13:39:01 your naive if you think these consolidations wouldn't be happening without the government. In fact the only way to stop them from happening is with the government. 

Standard oil taught us a lot one company will eventually out compete all the rest.
4958 2018-07-30 13:38:54 Many more petrol cars in UK and USA than Eastern Europe during time of lead in petrol. Oil burners relatively more common in East. Plus just less cars.

4969 2018-07-30 13:37:54 en même temps, toutes les études actuelles sur les relevés réels (chaleur, fonte des glaciers...) concluent toujours par : "les données relevées vont au delà des prévisions les plus pessimistes...", alors je ne suis qu'à moitié étonné...
4970 2018-07-30 13:37:45 What needed turning around? Steady growth, lowering unemployment and steady oil prices all there prior to ‘17 . Now two out of three, with oil higher. Plus strong evidence that tax bill is reducing home sales in parts of country due to mortgage deduction changes.

You shall eat, but not be satisfied; You shall sow, but not reap; You shall tread the olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil; And make sweet wine, but not drink wine. - Micah 6:13-15
4976 2018-07-30 13:37:12 You try to absorb them? So why do the pump prices rise instantly when oil goes up, yet you take a moment the of Sundays to reduce? 

Why has #rugeley gone up 5p in a week? Why?! It's summer, you've raised the prices...that's it

4994 2018-07-30 13:35:32 Seems to me like there is some sort of correlation between China's progressive take on electric vehicles and their hand in alternative oil and energy around the world. Do you think if US took more interest and investment in properties like cobalt we would be seeing more ev?
4995 2018-07-30 13:35:13 Their money was used to buy tax cuts for the rich, deregulations for oil and gas, favors in the cabinet for large donors, and now?  They realize that they created a monster.

4997 2018-07-30 13:35:02 Hi Michael, when oil prices rise we do always try to absorb these costs so as not to pass them on to our customers. Unfortunately, that's not always possible. We appreciate your feedback. Thanks - Bryan
4998 2018-07-30 13:34:58 In another era, her bullshit product would be called snake oil  and her hawking of it quackery.
4999 2018-07-30 13:34:55 Seems like a fair idea. Except for it to work, all fiscal transfers the other way would also have to stop, so all Scottish taxes paid would stay in Scotland, all oil money, all whisky export tax etc. Then we'll see what indy would be like.

5030 2018-07-30 13:31:49 As consumers, 1 way or the other, we all pay 2 reap the benefits of oil. Most #Americans have decided that until financially viable option r found, oil is so vital that pricing it out of mkt remains in the land of rainbows & unicorns.
5031 2018-07-30 13:31:47 BRASIL: Preocupaciones por la oferta del petróleo colocan al crudo tipo Brent por encima de los $70 por barril. Según #Petrobras, representa 8 dólares más que la cantidad necesária para pagar su deuda. #BRL #Oil

5034 2018-07-30 13:31:20 Magmamahal ng P1.15 ang kada litro ng gasolina. 95 centavos naman ang dagdag sa kada litro ng diesel. Ang oil price hike ay bunsod ng pagbabago ng presyuhan sa world market.
5035 2018-07-30 13:30:59 I saw this and honestly I was so close to tweeting a picture of my Ontario birth certificate but I was afraid of @GambleVII asking me how much oil it took to produce the plastic casing that it’s in.

5053 2018-07-30 13:29:10 Of all the setting elements of the Fallout universe, the whole oil thing is probably the most inconsistent. Every so often they remember to give a weapon wooden furniture instead of synthetic, or put nonperishables in tins instead of plastic, but for the most part...

5072 2018-07-30 13:26:22 I’ll stick with stupid. This “they need us more...” comment is stupidly arrogant and a major reason we are in this situation. We need everyone more than they need us.

5105 2018-07-30 13:22:45 What's missing is that oil is still cheap at $100 a barrel. A higher oil price would signal that we actually have a recovery vs our "Fragile" "Weekend At Bernies" economy.
5106 2018-07-30 13:22:32 "one of our reasons for low inflation is that the price of oil went up on the world stage but it was not reflected in Jamaica or passed on by #Petrojam" #BrianWynter #JamaicanDollar #morningagenda
5107 2018-07-30 13:22:25 Oil price hike effective tomorrow. -CNN
5108 2018-07-30 13:22:24 明日も！仕事！七時出社！
5109 2018-07-30 13:22:18 Under the OR Low (1st 30min) could lead price back to Friday's high 69.78. Its not an open gap until the day session is complete. 70.31 is obviously filled.

5112 2018-07-30 13:21:47 Man I was supposed to get my oil changed and I forgot lmao
5113 2018-07-30 13:21:47 Integrity,& cowardice are like oil,& water. The two cannot exist within the same vessel. They are polar opposites of one another.

As black men,we MUST examine our souls for signs of cowardly infection,& purge it! Cowardice is CANCER to a black soul,& EVERYTHING  around it!
5114 2018-07-30 13:21:33 I think it is disingenuous to blame it all on a single person or party.
Puerto Rico can't vote so neither party has much interest in the Colony. 
They had 7 military bases their to protect oil shipments until GPS came along.
now they have 1. They have been used & abused by system
5115 2018-07-30 13:21:25 A temporary aberration is he? What big oil wants, they get....lad. So sit down and STFU while we MAGA. Else ye just might find yourself in the Federal pen.

5122 2018-07-30 13:20:11 Historically Guyana main export was sugar and bauxite but then the industries went it to a slump which has bad for their economy To avoid.The same thing happen with the oil boom they could develop their renewable energy industry. Also they need to make sure everyone benefit
5123 2018-07-30 13:19:53 I think I put too much coconut oil on my face lmao
5124 2018-07-30 13:19:51 Existen las Puma todavía? No las había comprado Cristobal López? Cerca de mi casa había una que ahora es OIL... que tampoco entiendo cómo sigue funcionando
5125 2018-07-30 13:19:45 The oil boom in Guyana can help lift the country out of poverty and reduce dependency on international aid but too often, the revenue goes missing, deals are done behind closed doors allowing corrupt elites to benefit and stopping citizens from knowing the value of the wealth.
5126 2018-07-30 13:19:36 Asan ang oil dan par? Hahaha
5127 2018-07-30 13:19:31 would have been great...  alcohol could have been cleaner than oil.. but Rockefeller lobbied and bought the government and made oil the standard fuel.   The US history is full of capitalist stories like this destroying the sanctity of our government
5128 2018-07-30 13:19:26 Especially design for them or for owners who want their pets to smell like lavenders? Pet shampoo must be odorless and one tha does not make skin dry. And cooking oil will do for those owners who fancy slippery pets.
5129 2018-07-30 13:19:25 Let's see how you utilise yours. I think oil price is averaging $80 per barrel! Talk is cheap. Just as he promised heaven on earth during 2015 election campaigns and reversed the little achievement made by other administrations with complains upon complains.
5130 2018-07-30 13:19:21 Yeah oil paintings is right Ad! A couple of em in there look like The Scream! 
5131 2018-07-30 13:19:20 A bunch of $XOP names showed up w/ bullish set-ups into the week after a lot of ugly candles elsewhere Friday, Crude Oil up 2% early should help $COP $EOG
5132 2018-07-30 13:19:20 And yes if inflation doesn’t slow, LT bonds get hit as well. I’m slightly bearish oil bc global growth trend is down as are leading indicators. That said, commods look much better than other sectors here imo.
5133 2018-07-30 13:19:18 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5134 2018-07-30 13:19:16 From what I have ascertained they were a bit too dependent on oil, and had too many subsidies to let the market work. Too many eggs in one basket, no balance.
5135 2018-07-30 13:19:11 Oil could be back to US$45 a barrel within 12 months, Citigroup’s commodities chief Ed Morse said in an interview with the Financial Post, noting that the bullish case for crude is based on a faulty analysis.
5136 2018-07-30 13:19:08 As a random update, I no longer have to worry about my town thinking I dump oil out randomly.  That said, the explanation they provided was weird
5137 2018-07-30 13:19:06 yea I made that in the morning! ^^
it's really easy~ just toss your favourite vegetables in olive oil, salt and any of your favourite dried herb or just garlic powder and put it in the oven  and I just pan fried the chicken fillet hehehe
5138 2018-07-30 13:19:04 If you get green mangoes , make kairi ki lunji. 
1. Chop up the mangoes into small pieces 
2. In kadai put little oil and put on flame 
3. Put a little bit of rye in the oil. Once it starts bubbling , add a tea spoon of heeng, haldi, salt and red chilli powder

5234 2018-07-30 13:06:13 You cannot get an appointment letter by pointing a gun at your employers head and force him to sign your resumption. Sit on his desk, check the coffers and amass wealth to yourself and distribute oil wells like sweets. Is that what you meant?
5235 2018-07-30 13:05:59 The @POTUS should be looking at the rise in oil prices this morning and turn loose some of the excess US oil stored every where in the country.  STOP SUPPORTING OPEC

5259 2018-07-30 13:02:41 That's the thing. They might bioaccumulate, but you would have to prove that they actually do, then show a mechanism by which their consumption leads to significant metabolic issues.

In terms of orders of magnitude, veg oil, grains and sugar seem far more potent than steak.

Buhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with us as a country?

5267 2018-07-30 13:01:51 The decision and repercussions of it, that came during a time of high oil prices $140 or so, and our export output was below 300kBpd so we weren’t earning much and increasing public welfare spending...thus not saving anything, the beginning of all these problems

5271 2018-07-30 13:01:26 what in the hell is causing the spike in oil this morning.  The US has way more than we need so turn it loose on the market.  We do not need to make OPEC richer.

5274 2018-07-30 13:01:10 This is really new to me. One of my distant relatives admitted that she never do the dishes because she fainted every time she did so. The feeling and thought of oil in her hands is just killing her. Huhuhuhu
5275 2018-07-30 13:01:08 I don’t put oil in my car for what was probably two years and everyone has to have feelings about it 
5276 2018-07-30 13:00:53 I should probably change my oil soon. It’s been way too hot to be under a car though...
5277 2018-07-30 13:00:44 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them & anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. JA 5:14

5290 2018-07-30 12:59:32 I read an American thriller type novel, about a Constitutional Lawyer (could have been the title), and he came across all this corruption with an oil company - I learnt loads about fracking, the amount of water, and what should be done with it! Yuk!

What do we know about Reps. Think about it.

5336 2018-07-30 12:54:09 Ok I’ve seen the commercials enough and it’s settled. I’m going to walk around random lakes and swamps with a bottle of Dawn dishwashing liquid, and look for baby ducks that may have come across random oil slicks and wash them. #leanonme #whereareoilslicks #socuteicouldcry 
5337 2018-07-30 12:54:05 Power is a very profitable business. Dreaming of lower electric costs is like dreaming of lower fuel prices locally when world oil prices are lowered. Never happened, it ain't happening now, won't happen ever. At least, not in Kenya.

5349 2018-07-30 12:52:11 @MBuhari @APCNigeria the exploitation of oil on our Nigerdelta habitats has made millions of us lose our fishing jobs. We need open fishing reserves in the lake chad, and every other waterway in Nigeria or we kill people. Does this make sense to you? If not, why should the other?
5350 2018-07-30 12:52:00 since im at like 2 inches of beard growth im now wearing beard oil.

5351 2018-07-30 12:51:47 These are some great startups. The one producing oil from plastic has really caught our eye. That is quite an innovation and will be great in solving the fuel problem too.
5352 2018-07-30 12:51:46 Thanks for tweeting in Tatianna, do you think there are lessons Guyana should draw from other parts of the Caribbean handling its own oil resources?
5353 2018-07-30 12:51:45 I opened a new jar of coconut oil this morning. I had to dip my pinky in it one time to make sure it was pure.
5354 2018-07-30 12:51:40 The oil is a form of lubricant that makes penetration easy and less painful on the side of the lady if she isn't wet enough. I think.

5371 2018-07-30 12:49:51 I use coconut oil at night so it’s kinda all soaked up by morning. but now that you say that it is kinda lowkey, I can’t stop tho 
5372 2018-07-30 12:49:42 That's interesting - rate differentials dominate, adjusted for risk drivers that push up USD...with oil serving a somewhat weird role that helps explain both 2002-2007 usd weakness as well as 2012-2014 weakness around QE

Good looking fit

5446 2018-07-30 12:40:48 The geopolitical dynamic wasn't as simple as that. If the British were able to hold out for a "couple more years" the Germans would have been dangerously susceptible to an attack from the USSR. Their proximity to the Romanian oil fields alone posed a latent threat.

5500 2018-07-30 12:34:47 Det regleras via något som heter Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Där finns en möjlighet inte bara för staten utan även andra intressenter såsom privata näringsidkare att få ersättning. Den är direkt dvs. behöver inte claimas av redaren utan det finns pengar att få oaktat där.
5501 2018-07-30 12:34:33 Better do it quick. Polis is campaigning on destroying the oil and gas industry in Colorado.
5502 2018-07-30 12:34:05 Tip from LynetteCenee: a drop of olive oil on cuticles makes nails grow faster. #manicure
5503 2018-07-30 12:34:01 If oil is worth zero then we won't need to consider it when dividing up the UKs 'shared' wealth ;)
5504 2018-07-30 12:33:51 Seriously, I did work in Russia & Eastern Europe in the late 90s. 

Without oil & natural gas Russia is 3rd world. 

The “Mafia” is involved in almost everything. 

Very depressed population. 

Happy now?

5513 2018-07-30 12:32:35 I cleaned my nipple daily with olive oil a.m and pm and press the breast twice also. I had to waste some milk to keep the breasts flowing. Once I got back home, ran a hot bath, massaged the breasts, milk flowed, we continued breastfeeding. The first few days, I had to deal with

5516 2018-07-30 12:32:32 Drive by grain elevators in the Midwest. There are already huge mounds of soybeans being stored outdoors, and numerous tank cars sitting unfilled at soybean oil processing plants. Plus, everywhere you look, fields of more soybeans getting ready for harvest. Okay, then.

5519 2018-07-30 12:31:20 It would only be accepted 
if conceptually it stuck 'religiously' to the 
original, magic recipe:

~ Fit the drivetrain from 
the biggest car in our range 
into the smallest one ~.

(Today, frankly, this should
be a piece of cake with these downsized, "fry-their-own-oil" mills..)

5521 2018-07-30 12:31:03 Won’t be surprised if the oil lobby paid him to do that. They’ve been running an anti-petition campaign here. Making people think they can’t be sure who’s behind petitions, when they’re the only one actually trying to hide their involvement.

5528 2018-07-30 12:30:11 We’re more dependent on oil now then ever before.

5531 2018-07-30 12:29:21 Consider: water in plastic bottles sit inside HOT warehouses/trailers for days before delivery. Filters need to be cleaned regularly, if not, they aren’t filtering a thing. So, yah, all about the same..

5563 2018-07-30 12:24:38 Sure! I'll give you an example..look at the DRC in Africa, the leading producers of cobalt to the world. This is an alt to oil and we should get involved. The DRC needs a strong western power (US) but they are a developing country. Would this 'slow down the economy'? Or help it?

5582 2018-07-30 12:22:13 Food for thought.

Soak your nails in olive oil 10-15mins once a day every day for a month, then twice a week. This can help fortify weak, damaged and peeling nails.

5604 2018-07-30 12:16:25 It’s also partly due to the fact renewable energy doesn’t cause war, unlike oil.
The global elite would rather see us all fighting over a limited stock of fossil fuel than making the planet habitable for everyone.
5605 2018-07-30 12:16:22 I think there's an analogy with finding oil. The larger reserves are both easier to find and more valuable.
5606 2018-07-30 12:16:17 Or he’s just inclined to get Russia in the Oil market. All while US oil goes along with it as long as it knocks Iran and some Mid East countries out of the market. The sticking point then continues to be Russian sanctions.
5607 2018-07-30 12:16:09 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

5617 2018-07-30 12:14:45 Yup three steps  

1. Took loan from China

2. Set with different money exchangers to stop physical transportation of dollar. 

3. Interim gov knowingly kept the prices of oil high, which took a toll on dollar, so that the new government can get some relief in first few months.
5618 2018-07-30 12:14:23 That and internal pressure from US oil to keep Russia out of the Chinese and India markets as well. But does Trump understand or care about that... So WHY a trade war? Unless it’s wagging the dog for when Oil Sales lessen the trade imbalance so he can misdirect and claim victory?
5619 2018-07-30 12:14:14 Exxon Earnings

3. The solar/wind replacement is underway and inevitable. Ask Boone Pickens.
5637 2018-07-30 12:11:36 Siemens, GE, alstom ...etc are conglomerates with yearly sales exceeds the GDP of some oil producing countries (GE 2016 revenue=$120b).These are companies with CEO's whom can pick the phone and call US president or UKPM any time of the day
They're much stronger than our countries

5652 2018-07-30 12:08:07 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones.

5658 2018-07-30 12:07:46 Speaking of Russia's oil/energy wealth, how about how Trump blasted Germany for accepting Russia's Pipeline proposal, saying he is against it and it would make them even more dependent on Russian energy, to the tune of 70%? That's an anti-Russian interest position, and pro NATO

5726 2018-07-30 11:56:24 This also has the effect of pushing oil money into the US economy while creating leverage from China against the US as well. The threat of China halting oil imports in favor of Russia could hit the US hard. We’re more dependent on Oil then ever now.

5764 2018-07-30 11:48:45 We have not even managed to grant human rights to our closest relatives, the great apes. Until we've done that, I won't think about rights for machines. Monkeys die every day because the forests are being cleared for palm oil!

5768 2018-07-30 11:47:41 We don't need dirty oil business.
5769 2018-07-30 11:46:52 Things that r false motivations.  Guilt. Hatred fear envy lust. If u use these to persuade followers to your cause then u are just a snake oil salesman

5773 2018-07-30 11:46:36 As I hit the road to Gencon... Two new tires, new battery, an oil change, and two hours cleaning the Grant mobile.

5780 2018-07-30 11:45:25 How wrong can you be? Four years ago, when oil was still bringing in money. It isn’t doing so today. Why don’t you read the SNP’s Growth Commission report? It will give you a clearer picture of the austerity iScotland would face.
5781 2018-07-30 11:45:20 それな！
5782 2018-07-30 11:45:19 I've never seen any of them.
5783 2018-07-30 11:45:07 Saddam  was a bad guy. He did not like US oil companies
5784 2018-07-30 11:44:56 The UK government taxed the oil companies plenty just like Norway, but does not tax the people the way that Norway does. UK tax is c 34% of GDP Norway is c 55% of GDP.

Norway reduced its health and education budgets in the last oil downturn while UK increased spending.
5785 2018-07-30 11:44:05 Regular vegetable oil.
5786 2018-07-30 11:44:01 何それwww
5787 2018-07-30 11:44:01 Then after that, grease your skillet or if you dont have skillet use frying pan with butter or veg oil, remember I said grease. 
Then heat up and pour the batter(mixture) into the skillet. 
Then keep flipping till slightly brown 
Then your pancake is ready to be served 
5788 2018-07-30 11:43:57 I only remember Mao and co being trapped in a dark maze with limited amount of cooking oil to use as a lantern, and only a rat trained to know the path to the exit knew how to get out from it.

5790 2018-07-30 11:43:30 Would b great if u actually pay attention instead of just spewing propaganda spanky. As I stated, until financially viable alternate is found, #America runs on cheap, reliable oil.
5791 2018-07-30 11:43:17 I might spring for a matinee ticket...mostly because I like Simon Pegg, and Henry Cavill (*swoon*).
5792 2018-07-30 11:43:16 And do not forget booming oil industry!
5793 2018-07-30 11:43:16 He looked very leggy, oppo players were leaving him stranded. Unfortunately seemed to have the quick turning ability of an oil tanker. Saying that, was it his 4th game in a week?
5794 2018-07-30 11:43:15 Oil presumably has to be imported into the UK to be refined into petrol/diesel. What makes them think that they'll be able to fuel their helicopters and trucks when the incoming oil is presumably going to be subject to the same customs chaos as everything else?
5795 2018-07-30 11:43:00 @DainikBhaskar are you pramoting 10 days hair oil...you know product is profitable
5796 2018-07-30 11:42:49 Boil her killer in oil and then round up everyone who's ever committed a violent crime against a person of another race on BART and boil all of them in oil.  Let's get rid of all racists so peaceful people can ride public transit w/o being raped, robbed, murdered or terrorized.
5797 2018-07-30 11:42:30 Next is what will you do with the junk vehicles? Better to throw it to the sea after removing the engine oil and fuel as habitat of sea creatures.
5798 2018-07-30 11:42:20 @LBC These are the same people eating palm oil products that require vast areas of forest to be chopped down
5799 2018-07-30 11:42:14 Why are you complecated everything...clean the fish, put everything in olive oil...potatos you know :D....and voila!

5802 2018-07-30 11:42:07 Oil. Hedge funds liquidated longs, trump quiet, global demand still rising, long term capex still behind trend for new resources.

5803 2018-07-30 11:42:07 This week will have many important earnings reports and government reports.  Today, US stock futures are mixed with the Dow up 0.1% and the Nasdaq off 0.25%. Europe is mixed with Asia lower.  Gold is $1.222 with oil at $70.21.
5804 2018-07-30 11:41:59 เพื่อนครับ พี่พบอยากมาเหรอ
5805 2018-07-30 11:41:58 The real reason we are seeing disruption in flights,is a test by governments around the world,to quantify oil supply disruptions to supply chains and to measure ppls reactions.Soon we will have 200 usd oil ,airlines will be bankrupt at those prices
5806 2018-07-30 11:41:55 I saw it yesterday and it was fricking amazing.
5807 2018-07-30 11:41:51 Gasoil or fuel oil? For power generation...
5808 2018-07-30 11:41:39 Fazlu can still have quota of ‘Mustard Oil’ if opportunity of Diesel is dim 
5809 2018-07-30 11:41:36 It was water based paint at least so it could have been worse, if it was oil based it'd be a lot worse. Or if he'd swallowed more than only a drop. 

But... Hospital visit anyway just to be safe.

5814 2018-07-30 11:40:33 Hi Anne, We can confirm that the Cashew butter was too dry on occasions which meant it did not meet our standards. We decided to use sunflower oil to give the Cashew butter a consistent texture. I can confirm it had nothing to do with the supermarkets.
5815 2018-07-30 11:40:32 Every time I look at my new bottle of olive oil I think it's a bottle of Jack Daniels. Are the hallucinations finally kicking in? :O ;)

5818 2018-07-30 11:40:23 What kind of oil did you use? I'm looking at doing some experiments with rice.
5819 2018-07-30 11:40:23 You are correct, they drink the cool-aid and willingly join the slaughterhouse parade. The war again Iran is another blood for oil program, but people think the warmongers are fighting for freedom...creating faraway enemies keeps the enslaved comfortable.

5831 2018-07-30 11:38:52 Likewise China could leverage other Mid East oil producers, stacking more countries against any cooperation/outreach to Iran regardless of their cooperation or lack there of. It’s dogpiling in order to keep them out of the market as much as possible for the other oil producers.
5832 2018-07-30 11:38:48 Yeah I absolutely loved it albeit back in 2005, went back in 2015 and was mesmerized how much it had changed. When I was there in 05 I was talking to a sheikh in the hotel lounge and he said back then that oil was running out and the plan was to turn Dubai into tourism...
5833 2018-07-30 11:38:39 Like shart printer @Mr_JAGs always says "All politics is local". If pmb goes after people from 'our oyel' region cuz of the looting under Hero. I bet you he won't he even have any oil to sell not to talk earning the little he is earning now. Nigeria is trivialised. Etnic/religion

5851 2018-07-30 11:36:24 You know better ,if they put the wrong oil and caused the damage ,the garage should pay after deductibg the milage the engine has been used. This is my opinion. I ran a garage before and if this happens in our garage we would replace the engine with apology.

5855 2018-07-30 11:35:53 If Iran played nicely, and the West went along with it, they could have opened up more oil for trading. Keeping oil prices low and buyers away from the Russian market to one who’s best interest is to play nice with the West to lessen sanctions. How is this not still about Oil?

5868 2018-07-30 11:33:08 The anti-everything crowd believes that if they keep up the pressure, the government will eventually give in and force the oil companies to release the secret blueprints for the water-powered car, the gravity drive flying saucer and the zero point perpetual motion machine.

5871 2018-07-30 11:32:53 Can I just add a nugget of a hypothesis? China is buying crude from Iran. Russian and those sympathetic destabilize Iran shuttering exports forcing China to be more dependent on Russia for Oil. If US sanctions of Russia drop, that also opens the US market.
5872 2018-07-30 11:32:19 YAY!! SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH FROM GREEDY OIL COMPANIES!!!!!
5873 2018-07-30 11:31:57 Funding is an issue if the person being funded has a conflict of interest.  Like a politician for example, taking money directly from oil companies and then directing public funds to subsidise oil companies.  For a private organisation its far less important.

5897 2018-07-30 11:27:58 Yes density tu satu sebab. But dlm kes dia tu, air sungai tak bercampur dgn air laut.

Milk boleh campur dengan air biasa. Soap pun boleh campur. Jadi unsaturated.

Oil ke apa benda pekat tu tak bercampur sebab molekul dorang packed differently. Not entirely because of density.
5898 2018-07-30 11:27:53 Nope! Starter starts by filling up the tank. Then driver has fun and periodically empties the tank and crashes the car. So starter then extorts those who never got to ride, for funds to buy oil & repair the crashed body to start it all over again. Cyclical bubble bursting.

6053 2018-07-30 10:57:37 I honestly don’t have a skin care routine yet. 
Good genes, tbvh. 
I use Papaya extract soap and Jergens Hydrating Coconut Oil body cream. 
I recently started using Neutrogena Hydro Boost on my face as I heard body cream is bad for the face.
6054 2018-07-30 10:57:34 Milkc soalnya..... susah nyari yg oil
6055 2018-07-30 10:57:19 Remember Oil was stolen MASSIVELY under GEJ’s tenure of madness. This is only official figures of sales o. SALES that even CBN govnr said they couldn’t account for over $20Billion before GEJ sacked him o. Nobody knows just how much oil was stolen on the high seas.
6056 2018-07-30 10:57:07 Fresh Graduates with Network and IT Administrative skills should send their cvs now  jobforcenigeria@gmail.com ... ( The client is an Oil firm in Delta State)

6060 2018-07-30 10:55:55 Or Johnson baby oil. Who cares 
6061 2018-07-30 10:55:48 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick -James 5:14-15.
6062 2018-07-30 10:55:13 Yeah it is. And, believe it or not, the tap water in New York City is downright delicious.
6063 2018-07-30 10:55:06 Nzeogwu was arrested in Lagos on January 18, 1966, His other counterparts were equally arrested. The problem was the delay in prosecution.

Also if you can buy Oil, Politics and Violence: Nigeria's Military Coup Culture (1966-1976) by @maxsiollun It's a brilliant read.

6078 2018-07-30 10:51:45  you’re funny. Well enjoy your manufactured plastic goods while you shame people who use a straw. Basically everything you use or buy has oil that allows it to be made or transported.

6084 2018-07-30 10:50:05 Skyrocketing to where? Is Oil selling for anything even close to $90/barrel?? GEJ enjoyed $130/barrel for much of his 5yr presidency. At the very least Oil was selling over $100/barrel in his presidency. No savings, no completed project anywhere. 5yrs sir.

6159 2018-07-30 10:35:18 It isn't really more expensive it only seems that way because politicians have been giving oil co.'s use of our land, paying to clean up their pollution,  subsidizing oil extraction-transportation & give them massive tax breaks-incentives.  It's BEING complicated not it is.

6240 2018-07-30 10:19:31 Yes it does. And this is only official data. i.e. from oil exported legally. What about oil stolen and lost? Estimated at about 250,000 bpd. (An estimated 1.5 billion barrels were reported to have been stolen between 2011 - 2014). When you put all that together, you'll just Sigh!

6302 2018-07-30 10:09:34 Oh yes, North Sea oil. What are we going to be like when that runs out?
6303 2018-07-30 10:09:16 Note that the chart did not say "Nigeria Govt Revenue". It just said "Nigeria Revenue" (under different presidents and their party). This is because the chart is just allocating the value of our oil export which is different from the net amt that'll be available for FAAC Sharing.
6304 2018-07-30 10:09:15 That blasted oil, we really shouldn’t bother with it should we. It seems that we keep getting less wealthy as a country the more we find. Right now the oil money is being spread out for 56 million people, when it could be spent on 5.5 million instead.

6714 2018-07-30 08:48:16 At the current rate of oil consumption, we will run out of oil in about 39 years.
6715 2018-07-30 08:48:14 i always just assumed if somebody wasn't wearing them they were either just slightly nearsighted or wearing contacts lmao somebody draw me an oil painting of what it looks like to see the world with 20/20

6718 2018-07-30 08:47:23 Have you thought about DIY mixing a Burt's bees body product with peppermint essential oil??
6719 2018-07-30 08:47:15 Cocoa oil tu pakai after serum/moisturizer or before serum/moisturizer ?

6721 2018-07-30 08:46:50 How a snake oil salesman like you can prey on vulnerable people who don’t know your history makes me depressed and anxious.
6722 2018-07-30 08:46:13 Thats good but why free?  i mean we import shed loads from china,even a 1% reciprocal tariff would oil the wheels in our favour.
6723 2018-07-30 08:45:34 off to Sparta today AKA the land of my people and the thing i’m most excited for is....... the olive oil museum
6724 2018-07-30 08:45:15 Also America asking us not to buy oil from Iran ignoring we won self determination on 15th Aug.1957
6725 2018-07-30 08:45:14 Hope the oil in it will never run dry whenever I'll want to fry
6726 2018-07-30 08:45:11 I need a titanium white oil paint and i am too lazy to go and buy one.

6729 2018-07-30 08:44:17 China lacks laws to hold them criminally accountable for fraud. Recommended movie: the China Hustle. There is money in destroying fisheries with these ventures. I bet oil is the actual intent behind it. Use this to kill the fish then drill.
6730 2018-07-30 08:44:08 If you were a sensible person, u will know that the rise of international price of crude oil, is a good thing for oil rich nations.

But you are a Buharideen. Wich is a synonym for mumu
6731 2018-07-30 08:43:44 Buhari wants2build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil state but wants2build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state.
6732 2018-07-30 08:43:29 Who says Nigeria won't be great again? Nigeria will be GREAT not by the amount of crude oil we export BUT by the WILL of her citizens to make it great. I applaud you @segalink

6737 2018-07-30 08:41:51 Fascinating isn’t it. Their fossil-fuel romance is way more monogamous than Barnaby’s marriage, with oil all but forgotten, and gas getting just the occasional nudge. I’m pretty certain this reflects the magnitude of revenue derived from each fuel type.

6753 2018-07-30 08:39:40 It's been 13 years since @ImRaina made his debut for India Vs Sri Lanka in Dambulla during Indian Oil Cup. Still remember that as a 7 year old I had gone curious that a player of my similar surname was playing for India & took out my school ID card to confirm the same.
6754 2018-07-30 08:39:36 lots of oil, make it crispy
6755 2018-07-30 08:39:18 This is the moment I remind you,  years ago on Facebook when I told you guys China has nothing good for Africa and you said I shouldn't be so skeptical. The only hurdle is corruption and incompetence of our rulers (in building the last nails in our coffin, Oil pipeline & SGR)
6756 2018-07-30 08:39:07 Most states don't have low population+ natural resource. 
Oil - would nominally not fit most people's acceptable source going forwards. Exploitation or CO emission.
The bulk of people should work. Its a bad idea to build a belief system on no work required.

6763 2018-07-30 08:38:17 For now we want this to end. Nd yes they’ve been careless about it(the governor) it started with gunmen going to villages to steal cows in 2015-2016 as I recall. But they left it to grow bigger.
6764 2018-07-30 08:37:59 I knew he was sh*tty b/c of years of reading from sources L, R & also neutral gossipy stories re trump. He comes across as a snake oil salesman - you just know. Decent women are repulsed by him. What one thing about him made you like him?

6769 2018-07-30 08:37:20 Think reversing The Oil & Gas Exploration and Mining Timeline for an end to Fosil Fuel could get to be problematic in 2020 as even Die Hard "Oilies" are realising Worldwide there is a desire for a Logical End to Polluting Fuels in the same way Plastic has to end=We need to adapt

6777 2018-07-30 08:36:00 The concept of MMT is so simple that the mind is repelled by it. However, like oil companies on climate change most politicians, bankers and Wall Street businesses do not always tell the truth. #LearnMMT

6783 2018-07-30 08:34:33 Okay..thanks for the referral
6784 2018-07-30 08:34:29 @MikeSonko Finya mtu asikie uzito. These people are full of shit. They need drastic action. Remember a few months ago at Oil Libya Petrol station in Westlands, the Asian lady what she did. Hawa watu wametuzoea. Deal with them Governor Sonko. No mercy. They are  too arrogant.
6785 2018-07-30 08:34:28 Oil Prices were mixed with U.S. benchmark WTI nudging higher after four weeks of declines, while Brent began the week lower as the fallout from trade tensions weighed on markets.
6786 2018-07-30 08:34:26 So the bill proposed 10% of proceeds as HCDF for Oil Producing communities. A northern rep stood up and said, every place where there is a filling station or pipeline is also a host community. That was how that died.

The reason they let it die was “for peace”1/2
6787 2018-07-30 08:34:23 WE SCOTS DO NOT AND NEVER DID MATTER

And Hoeneß is making some clear mistakes and that has nothing to do with "oil money". We were better organized with Hopfner.
6790 2018-07-30 08:33:34 Oh... so i guess people who are using the oil still need to keep there mouths shut so they dont get into trouble, trying to live

6794 2018-07-30 08:32:46 Oh boo hoo - I tried to run a campaign, deliberately broke the law and they fined me. I want to scam you all out of even more money so that I am not out of pocket.
You sir are a snake oil salesman - and the fine was far too lenient - crawl back under your rock.

6796 2018-07-30 08:31:59 Food for thought.
Buhari wants to build a cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with us as a country? 
6797 2018-07-30 08:31:33 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.
6798 2018-07-30 08:31:21 The Chinese state is also involved in many of Africa’s largest deals in key sectors such as oil, mining, infrastructure, and telecommunications which African countries have benefited from over the past years...

6832 2018-07-30 08:23:23 what's lamentable is the loss of the sense of the sacred around things in the sanctuary. e.g. in the east, oil from the sanctuary lamps, wax drippings from candles at shrines, are taken home as sort of sacramentals. even threadbare priestly vestments are repurposed.
6833 2018-07-30 08:22:48 Actually that's how I started. I did still life and portraits in oil. Mainly portraits in pastel. My love for Watercolour eventually knocked every other medium out of its path. Watercolour holds a magic that is impossible to ignore

6860 2018-07-30 08:16:58 I was thinking it was all fun and games when my aunt gave me a car to ease my movement. Big boy. Big boy. Now that I am buying fuel, changing oil and considering the stipend I am receiving I don't want to do big boy again. I want to enter keke and save money biko. 
6861 2018-07-30 08:16:28 Try the brand “in essence” they have a pillow spray and an oil that you can put into a diffuser that I use every night (you can always take the spray with you if you travel) I also use the app “relax melodies” that helps a lot x
6862 2018-07-30 08:16:21 so, Donald Trump now rules the world..telling everyone who they can and can't trade with...is he going to subsidise the price of fuel if we don't buy Iranian oil..the cost of crude oil will rise dramatically...
6863 2018-07-30 08:16:04 Trump haters grip on reality, what they have left, will diminish when none of this comes true and final insanity when he's reelected. 
Looking forward to it eagerly.

6865 2018-07-30 08:15:40 Hi Anne, Due to the variation of cashews that we purchase, we decided it was necessary to add some oil to the production process to ensure we maintain the best quality and texture of the product.We couldn't use Cashew oil as it has limited tractability so we used sunflower  oil.
6866 2018-07-30 08:15:23 I fear for Guyana and this new oil and gas discovery. You people are going to have to hit the ground running and hire some offshore professionals. There’s lots of professions around. Onshore drilling is not the same as offshore.

If Singapore had crude, they would've set up refineries very close to the Wells and drill sites to cut down production cost.

7030 2018-07-30 07:40:22 The build up to drilling is going to be an exciting journey. If the results prove positive and there's a high chance of that, investing now could be a life changer.

7032 2018-07-30 07:40:11 No, it's a lot more complicated than that. Berlusconi didn't want the attack, he had made a very good deal with Gheddafi for oil. France attacked Italy by attacking Libia. Berlusconi was stuck in a very big situation, and then he had to resign in what we call a white golpe.

7036 2018-07-30 07:38:26 I'm thinking of the animals, ultimately. I'm single-handedly trying to push everyone to EVs by exhausting all supplies of crude oil.
7037 2018-07-30 07:38:11 No, just air dry it,normally after I wash mine I put the conditioner and oil then do three strand braids just to stretch the shrinkage a little bit.

7039 2018-07-30 07:37:20 Come on , they’re oil rich so rich in fact 10yrs ago they were giving oil away to make bush look like an asshole 1800 joe 4oil look it up. problem is they nationalized and kicked out anybody who knew how to produce it.
7040 2018-07-30 07:37:18 Omg, thriving economy??? I had to stop reading right there,  under Obama  admin. the unemployed was at an all time high along with people on welfare. New construction was down, the oil field had completely shut down, nothing was thriving, all was stagnant, no point in going on...

7043 2018-07-30 07:36:43 Olives are pressed to get oil,
Fruits are squeezed for juice,
Flowers are crushed for perfume,

These are the methods used to get goodness out of things,

So whenever you feel crushed, squeezed or pressed, it means ALLAH is trying to get the best out of you.
7044 2018-07-30 07:35:59 Dont smile just yet at the scrapping of the Sh150 fixed cost for retail tariff for domestic consumers. In fact, electricity might be more expensive if you factor the volatility of forex and international oil prices
7045 2018-07-30 07:35:58 And we are supposed to be the special snowflakes. Twitter isn't owned by the government. They can remove any account that doesn't follow it's policies. They don't want to regulate coal or oil, but Twitter? Sure, regulate the heck out of it, as long as it benefits the right!

7059 2018-07-30 07:33:12 Because they refuse to retool yo these other technologies, kowtow to coal/oil suppliers, and enjoy their wealth. The alternatives are ALWAYS better. But, require reorganization, retraining, and resource/supply adjustments. That’s painful to shareholders. ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY

7069 2018-07-30 07:31:35 The truth is it all needs to be stopped! Fighting over which problems we solve first is counterproductive, big corporations need to answer for the levels of plastic they produce and have been producing for years. Oil is like the lead of our time we’ve seen this all before.
7070 2018-07-30 07:31:26 very unfortunate for Venz.. but something ironic about a hero of socialism potentially hiding cash for itself .. if proven will this help quicken the demise of his "dictatorship" and re open venz to western oil investment or has china/russia got PDVSA all sewn up

7076 2018-07-30 07:30:23 Oil from #Hibiscus or #Shoeflower is quite beneficial for hair and treats various conditions like dandruff, itchy scalp, hair loss, premature greying of the hair and aloplecia aerta. #MedicinalPlants #Ayurvedafacts
7077 2018-07-30 07:30:07 I know what you speak of!  Fortunately Scotland & other odd spots on the globe also have oil reserves. The Saudis are likely inflating their estimate. Regardless, it would really be hoove us all to kick the fossil fuel habit ASAP.
7078 2018-07-30 07:30:02 You speak like an ambulance chasing lawyer (sic). You know people despise them for their amoral deliberately disingenuous spin on everything, right? Or a snake oil salesman ‘oh if you check the small print’

7082 2018-07-30 07:28:07 Couldn't agree more. Just reminds me of how important it is to emphasize to the Republicans how important natural resources are..  Take oil, for instance. Why not use more of an alternative source?

    that ran down his beard
    and onto the border of his robe.

7090 2018-07-30 07:26:41 Though not with the goal of messing America up was my point. He wants predictable oligarchic allies (kompromat-leveraged) to whom he can offload his oil, and keep the Russian economy strong enough that the underclass doesn't revolt. Too much American disarray jeopardizes that.

7114 2018-07-30 07:21:20 1) who said anything about the state being in charge of it? Worker ownership!
2)just reinvest anyway, without giving so much to shareholders?
3) Venezuela actually has a smaller public sector than Germany or France (their main problem - oil prices).
7115 2018-07-30 07:21:13 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

7122 2018-07-30 07:20:10 Tragic to see. We pollute our planet both land and seas with plastics, chemicals ,effluent ,oil spillages etc and these are all too often the consequences suffered by our fellow creatures on this planet we call home. Everytime you throw cans ,bottles ,plastics etc at your ass .

7149 2018-07-30 07:14:41 But American disarray's a by-product, not a goal. Putin glimpsed his own fate in Gaddafi. Sanctions have crippled the oil deals that're the last chance for survival of his oligarchy. I don't think he cares what happens here much more than for its impact on his own survival.

7243 2018-07-30 06:55:44 The first oil embargo occured under RMN.
The gas lines were due to OPEC boycott.

It's clear that a yes vote would have led to a tightening of public finances, simply because the revenue promised would not be there.
The article, like the White paper assumed that the oil money would be coming in by the bucket load.

Questioning my decision to lube up the Mitchell bros with ‘anti-chafe fish oil’, pre-wetsuit tho...
7270 2018-07-30 06:50:17 Obama was able to do it, primarily by negotiating with Saudi Arabia. The added benefit, of course, is that it affects Iran negatively as well. 

Only problem is that for most M.E. nations, lowering oil prices is like holding their breath... They can do it, but only for so long.

7288 2018-07-30 06:47:19 Why do people think that Italians cook with extra virgin olive oil? FYI we don't. Extra virgin olive oil is only for raw food, i.e. salads etc. (unless you really wanna become fat and clog yourself up)

7336 2018-07-30 06:37:46 Well it tells me that Russia, despite its reputation, understands budgeting and is in a crunch. Ergo they upgrade the old stock rather than build the new stock. Oil prices haven't recovered...yet. But material sciences advances can be hacked onto any old thing

7418 2018-07-30 06:17:51 Well no, capitalism is. That’s the dominant ideology determining the quality of life on this planet.

Islam’s political relevance is based on the oil market. That’s why Islam matters. The worst of it (Daesh) comes from Wahhabism, which is all and only about US oil interests.

7440 2018-07-30 06:13:32 I alerted the cashier and she told the second person to queue again. Between the two of them, they had about 20 bottles of 5.4-liter cooking oil and packets of the 1.1-kg Milo. WTF

7476 2018-07-30 06:07:30 He brought up the Germany pipeline so he could claim Germany is owned by Russia; which is laughable.  That’s like saying Saudi Arabia owned us when we bought a large % of their oil.

7482 2018-07-30 06:06:56 Actually it's an opportunity. The answer to climate change is capitalism. Making renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels is the only way to make real change. Whale oil was killed by Rockefeller & so on 

The Original tweet is ignorant

Who controls the oil fields now that export oil to Europe, while turning a blind eye on the chaos they made? People like you are the real dangerous for the world. Supporting war, death and destruction.

7489 2018-07-30 06:04:37 I think we'll need super hot oil, otherwise it would just soak through the entire bee in no time. A bit like deep frying capers.

The bees are the attractant; the sardine oil (in empty cans hanging on the wire) are the teaching moment that keeps the bear alive.

Why? Because I'd like to see if the UK can survive without being a part of the EU. The only tangible good of value the UK has is oil, which will run out in 10 to 20 years.

Can the UK be successful like Singapore or HK? I hope we can all find out.

7682 2018-07-30 05:23:50 I need to not eat any bread and avoid refined oil and sugar even vegan. Takes little and it triggers anxiety apparently, but it’s addictive when it’s there lol.

7690 2018-07-30 05:21:59 Or is it more important to dedicate your life to $40k a year giving oil changes, I’m just trying to learn how to man up from an alpha like yourself

They somehow pulled over and my preggo cousin got a fire extinguisher from a cafe and put him out while their two dogs went batshit

7700 2018-07-30 05:20:34 My sunday is complete now too, I heard from u thanks to Twitter. Love u. Please buy some rock Simpson Oil asap. I dont want to lose u.
7701 2018-07-30 05:20:27 Agreed with the SNP crowd, Scotland better off breaking free from a Brit Establishment that only wants it for its oil.
And an excuse for a few toffs to play at being landed gentry.
That and a chance for it to thrive in the EU post-Brexit...

7705 2018-07-30 05:19:45 I did use peppermint oil for a few weeks till I ran out. That is probably why they are back, because the oil has dried up. I used spearmint oil till I ran out of that as well. We will get glue traps this week when we get paid.
7706 2018-07-30 05:19:30 That would include all those people who fell for Donald Trump‘s sneak oil sales pitch!

7708 2018-07-30 05:18:40 It's not about being done. The single biggest draw on oil reserves is the summer drive season. Which is coming to a close. We have over 600 million barrels in storage and Trump had already unloaded into the market once. The doe is already treating small batch sells.
7709 2018-07-30 05:18:36 The vegan community needs to get back to making patches about killing oil execs like the good ol days of 5 years ago.

7744 2018-07-30 05:14:02 But yeah, make sure you brush it often too. You want to distribute the oil throughout your hair instead of letting it get stuck at your scalp. Especially if you also tend to keep your hair up.

7812 2018-07-30 05:00:03 Exactly it, but for veg oil instead of olive oil. Oil is to keep butter from burning, not for flavour. Per MH, you can use spaghetti rather than egg pasta. Finish with fresh pepper in abundance.

7819 2018-07-30 04:58:40 Yeah, I hear you on that. In all fairness, here's where I'm stuck on this: non-renewables mean that eventually we will run out. In the case of oil, we are talking in the hundreds years. That's a serious problem for us to ignore.

7841 2018-07-30 04:53:55 You’d think, with the financial inducements available, that more appealing, effective spokespeople would step forward to sell that snake oil. Maybe the requisite lack of shame and empathy disqualifies many who would otherwise scramble for those dollars.

7855 2018-07-30 04:51:09 They can turn the suffering in Venezuela and Syria into a call for intervention to "save the kids." The oil and defense cos don't want an intervention in Yemen, or rather the intervention they want is already going to plan. Thus no "news" needed.

7959 2018-07-30 04:30:13 I agree with that statement 100% but I would argue that oil blood money is also allowing Islam to win!
7960 2018-07-30 04:30:04 No soap and water. Ever! 

Just burn the crud, and bush what you can off w/ steel brush. Use a bit of cooking oil on a paper towel (with burners OFF) to season the grates and prevent rust.
7961 2018-07-30 04:29:59 I’m tryna oil some ass up watch that shit bounce and suck on sum tiddies...
7962 2018-07-30 04:29:58 You should reward yourself with a triple cheeseburger! Soak the bun in fry oil. And down it with a triple chocolate milkshake. All while running in place. 
Feel that pain in your left arm increasing, ya d!ck!
7963 2018-07-30 04:29:56 Trump’s trying to collide with Putin at every step.  Putin hates Hillary because she’d have sanctioned Russia for invading Crimea.  Trump hired oil man and Putin’s buddy as sec of state to get sanctions dropped.  Didn’t work so well in Congress.
7964 2018-07-30 04:29:32 I’m WEAK bruh  and middle eastern niggas be like “lemme just pick up some oil real quick” 
7965 2018-07-30 04:29:20 why are people so pressed about plastic straws?? what about like,, oil spills and shit like that
7966 2018-07-30 04:28:59 Fiscally responsibility to GOP is Americans, not to have family health/ children care, education programs, veterans & senior care. Their fiscal concept is oil, banks, coal companies. Republicans always “talk the talk but don’t walk the walk” for Americans.
7967 2018-07-30 04:28:39 Crude oil & def system imports are big drag on our economy No feel good being labelled among major importers of wpns despite having dedicated research & prodn agencies On one hand we have reached Mars ,have highly accomplished scientists IISc IITs best of enterpreneurship #

I wanna know the best brands to get oil. I know about CW any others Twitter fam? #cbdoil
7969 2018-07-30 04:28:20 CNN IS A BIG JOKE! I WOULD RATHER DRINK MOTOR OIL THAN TO LISTEN TO THAT TOILET FLUSHING!#MAGA
7970 2018-07-30 04:28:11 Is democracy even a realistic thing for the Middle East? With its scarce resources - aside from oil - the culture there never entertained such notions, imo, for good reasons.
7971 2018-07-30 04:28:00 During Op. Barbarossa, the Furher has told his Top Brass that Wheat Fields of Ukraine  & the Oil Fields of Romania  were vital for the war effort.
#NATO is working along same lines & making the same mistake.
Once the #Bear  is angry, the equation goes awry very quickly.
7972 2018-07-30 04:27:58 why is america wasting sooo much energy, wasting gas, oil and producing trash and trash everywhere ???
7973 2018-07-30 04:27:55 Press release by PH Sarawak regarding Oil Royalty.
7974 2018-07-30 04:27:44 What a joke no collusion going on do they think we are stupid fuel goes up just before long weekend or school holidays when oil prices are stable, there should be a royal commission or investigations into the prices similar to the banks and power companies
7975 2018-07-30 04:27:43 i’m literally supposed to be spending 100 bucks on oil every month lmao luigi’s a spoiled brat

7978 2018-07-30 04:26:39 It would have been me at 11 sitting their awkwardly and my mum having to re-buy olive oil.
7979 2018-07-30 04:26:08 You could get rid of the pain if you lower the carbs below - let`s say 50g per day - and ditch all plant based oils except olive and avocado oil (fruit oils).
But let`s be honest, in your case the alcohol might get in the way, bc that stuff is highly inflammatory, too.

7981 2018-07-30 04:25:33 If we don’t start re-training people soon we will have mass unemployment and poverty.  Just think how many car mechanics there are. That job will be gone in my lifetime. Gas station attendants gone. Oil jobs. Cashiers in most places. Truckers, manufacturing all gone soon.
7982 2018-07-30 04:25:27 i have a nose strip on that helps me breathe with a stuffy nose, eucalyptus oil basically rubbed into my nostrils to clear my airways SO I CAN BREATHE & now a tissue shoved up one nostril bc it’s running :)

7984 2018-07-30 04:25:13 on damp hair: cantu shea butter throughout my hair. don’t be afraid to use a lot. I try to stay away from combs/brushes, so I use my fingers. sometimes I finger coil stubborn front curls. let it air dry

on mostly dry hair: gently run coconut + argan oil through my hair and boom
7985 2018-07-30 04:25:10 i need to get an oil defuser
7986 2018-07-30 04:25:10 I use coconut oil , but the lady who does my hair said just to make sure alcohol isn't one of the first 5 ingredients.

7988 2018-07-30 04:25:05 Girl don’t give them the credit of “spicy mayo”. Not a drop of spice to be found! Maybe “mayo made with olive oil” and “vegenaise” lol
7989 2018-07-30 04:24:43 Isn't some portion of the value of those oil deposits capitalized into the value of state-owned oil companies like Equinor?
7990 2018-07-30 04:24:27 "You are beautiful.
Seeds in the soil.
Eucalyptus oil.

7991 2018-07-30 04:24:20 cbd oil has been my savior. Some nights, like tonight, my schedule gets messed with so they’re a bit harder. I also take a medicine to stop the nightmares.

7993 2018-07-30 04:24:09 Canadians have dismissed the well researched reports about the US based backdooe funding of propaganda and protesters to keep our oil landlocked. Many can’t believe corruption like this exists. I think many are now seeing how truly blatant it is. Hope it’s not too late.

7999 2018-07-30 04:22:05 I have recently joined this soaping group that only uses natural ingredients and they are very strict. So, no micas,no oxides, no fragrance oils. And they do a lot of plant/seed/bark/flower oil infusions for colour. And they use regular backyard or sometimes exotic, ingredients

8009 2018-07-30 04:20:24 Could be blown starter fuse, bad transmission, bad relay, or out of gas. Could also be the oil.
8010 2018-07-30 04:20:24 Oil up y’all dicks before y’all send them dick pictures...
8011 2018-07-30 04:20:00 Quantitative easing, extending tax cuts, regulating banks, helping to lower oil prices, stimulus, bailouts. There wasn't a perfect solution and much of it would have happened had Obama done it or someone else (if they were smart).

8015 2018-07-30 04:18:42 I’d have to say I make some of the best brownies. Sure I might use Aldi mix where you just have to add water, eggs, and vegetable oil, but I don’t care. They’re great.
8016 2018-07-30 04:18:37 It’s like our oil, we don’t want to use it till we buy it back from US.

8020 2018-07-30 04:16:47 Cleaned off the cobwebs and added Hemp Oil on this little handmade mini stool today. I love the grain in aged wood.
8021 2018-07-30 04:16:44 Asset Plays - The investment decision is primarily on the assets the company hold. The assets could be Cash/mining/oil reserves, land (sold in future).

Here investor MUST know the asset/value, but not Mr. Market

Investors CAN gain by buying stock below the value of such assets.
8022 2018-07-30 04:16:39 We have to do something about the plastic in our oceans. Fixing our environment is going to be a generations long mission… Maybe enough of one to take all our minds off politics, oil and war.
8023 2018-07-30 04:15:58 The olive oil brownie is totally yummy. It is the best brownie I have ever tasted! It is crispy & loaded with chocolate chips. Yum! <3
8024 2018-07-30 04:15:48 The US oil embargo of Japan in 1941 resulted in Pearl Harbor. 

Just saying stay alert. Desperate men do desperate acts. The Treasury Bill's and Notes are US Dollar denominated. If he wanted out of his Dollar position it worked.

#Putin bought gold with the proceeds supposedly.

8029 2018-07-30 04:14:27 Hindus have fortnightly calendar & not current weekly. As per that calendar, mustard oil should be offered to Lord Saturn on Ashtami (his day). But all astrologers are getting offered on all Saturdays which can backfire if day is Ekam or Saptam. Why do not follow Hindu calendar?

8033 2018-07-30 04:13:31 >It's submission to Islam/Oil/Money/friendship - inappropriate for National Ambassadors to beg. Better to assign men to Islamic Nations as Ambassadors and assign women to Non-Islamic Nations. Jesus had no problem choosing to appear first to a woman - Mary Magdalen after the crux.

8041 2018-07-30 04:11:30 I wonder if Trump wants to go to war with Iran to cause a crisis with oil supply, which then gives a great reason to drop Russian sanctions so that they can supply the shortfall
8042 2018-07-30 04:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: spicy crust with sad coconut oil and ham.
8043 2018-07-30 04:10:56 Yeah !! I put oil in my hair before I wash it too, oh damn :/
8044 2018-07-30 04:10:52 Is it because of the oil & gas? Maybe it's the coal or the cows. Would the emissions from planet Earth be the cause?
8045 2018-07-30 04:10:39 包丁くらい振り回しても心神耗弱に持ち込めばなんとかなると思われてんのかしらね(´・ω・｀)
8046 2018-07-30 04:10:38 @assampolice @ponjitdowarah isn't this a act of put oil in the fire. When we want a clean an peaceful @NRCupdateAssam people like this want opposite and as they're so called journalist, they're not caught for it. Great way to escape.

8049 2018-07-30 04:10:15 So how do we propose to replace heavy fuel oil and diesel burned in industry, transportation and remote communities? Wind, solar & batteries? Not 4 a few decades still. Cleaner fossil fuel LNG has to b part of the clean energy transition...
8050 2018-07-30 04:10:13 Only two male kittens— one black, one brown— remain, the others already adopted out to new homes. “They’re brothers. Oil and water, the both of ‘em, but they’ve got their own charms and are almost inseparable. Good luck.”

8052 2018-07-30 04:10:08 Sink Holes. Oops! Suck Trillions of barrels of oil, & trillions of cubic meters of natural gas from below our earths surface without result, give the head a shake! Just use a small amount of common sense.

Quiet achiever that one day will go boom in a big way imo
8055 2018-07-30 04:09:15 The PCs failed. They grossly mismanaged AB for at least two decades. 
They refused to consider that a oil crash would happen again as it always does, and didn't plan for it.
8056 2018-07-30 04:08:57 So I guess I need to lather my body in peppermint oil, the spider blood lust is REAL at my pad.
8057 2018-07-30 04:08:49 My playlist ... from Bruce Hornsby to REM to INXS to Midnight Oil to En Vogue to Don Henley to ... well, yes, Loverboy.
8058 2018-07-30 04:08:33 Plus the oil itself counts as wealth.
8059 2018-07-30 04:08:32 Really was a shame today. Was HOF'er snake oil salesman Selig there? I didn't see him. Probably lurking in the shadows.
8060 2018-07-30 04:08:09 Bitch go get that oil change lmao
8061 2018-07-30 04:07:56 I once heard a girl at a mechanic's shop say...when they asked her what kind of 'oil' she used...and she responded..."unleaded..that's what it says on the cap".  Couldn't believe I said that, but I was distracted...:/

8063 2018-07-30 04:07:34 Umm. I feel like we’ve covered this today— but marinade in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and grill with salt/pepper.
8064 2018-07-30 04:07:30 You don't see the irony of using Lac Megantic as an example considering that the project will decrease the number of oil trains? Quite impressive
8065 2018-07-30 04:07:12 Give your head a shake. 
The oil industry will NEVER be what is was. Not in Alberta, not anywhere. 
Alberta should have been planning for that years ago, and didn't. 
Oh, and those power plants? Guess what - the PCs started the shutdown plan. 
Go learn something.
8066 2018-07-30 04:07:06 So people with opinions and some analysis? Got it
8067 2018-07-30 04:06:26 Great! New Zealand, and the world, are going to need more of all forms of energy to meet demand in the 21st century - including oil and gas. By using carbon capture, offsetting and greater efficiency etc they all have an important role in a lower carbon world.
8068 2018-07-30 04:06:23 みおきさん！！ありがとうございます！！！
8069 2018-07-30 04:06:03 I recently bought a face cream and hate the smell  thoughts on putting lavender essential oil in it to make it smell better 
8070 2018-07-30 04:06:03 Yeah - why wasn't that twinned about a decade ago? 
All that PC "we love the oil industry" but they couldn't get their sh** together.
8071 2018-07-30 04:06:03 i think im getting a cold sore and im 100,% not here for that but the internet said slapping some tea tree oil on it might stop it in its tracks
8072 2018-07-30 04:06:00 Kk I live in Co and it’s super dry here but my T-zone produces so much oil it just breaks my makeup apart. I always use liquids but right now most of them don’t last even 8 hrs.
8073 2018-07-30 04:05:48 I put vitamin e oil and tea tree oil on my face and it broke me out  im hella irritated. Smh
8074 2018-07-30 04:05:40 What is it about peppermint oil that relaxes me so much?

8083 2018-07-30 04:04:00 Again, I insist that we both need  good knowledge of basic economics to have a good interactive argument on this platform

Many oil dependent economies if not all experienced devaluation of currency but our over dependent on importation is hurting.

You too imagine importing MSc.

8094 2018-07-30 04:02:18 Exactly! She made mistakes but took responsibility for them. She went on trial for the oil scam and tried to turn herself in for Beatrice’s murder. She wouldn’t let Robert cover for her and sacrifice his integrity the way Anna did.

8097 2018-07-30 04:02:04 So I did a hot oil treatment, deep condition, and wash my shit just to twist the front of my head and stop!  I was way too tired after all that extra shit
8098 2018-07-30 04:01:58 I've had three stroke and a heart attack.. Hemp oil is the only thing that gives me relief now...and fyi if it was stroke you would feel it more in your head than chest

8100 2018-07-30 04:01:00 I'm not a socialist. I'm a mixed market capitalist.

I'm not a fan of nationalized oil either.

8102 2018-07-30 04:00:41 PSA: pumpkin seed oil (or even eating reasonably large amounts of pumpkin seeds) has been shown to calm down the bladder especially in women who have been pregnant at some point in the past. Take a pill/eat seeds & have to pee a lot less. 

Myself & my grandmother are believers.

8105 2018-07-30 04:00:25 Tories spent decades running Alberta’s finances as if money grew on trees, Notley takes over just as oil price craters and a community pretty much burns to the ground and it’s all her fault even though the economy is starting to boom again.
8106 2018-07-30 04:00:11 Big corporations, eg oil industry, military industry, get billions from our tax $$ in subsidies that they don’t *need* since they are already hugely profitable. 

So really our $$ keeps cash flowing to their stockholders; again, not our general well being as a society.
8107 2018-07-30 04:00:04 Vilma Lusardi's Delizie, our family's line of pasta sauce and olive oil are available for sale at our restaurant!
8108 2018-07-30 03:59:55 I had no idea Hillary wanted to nationalize our oil. Seems a bit too extreme for her.

I think you're thinking of demutalization, which is what I support.

8111 2018-07-30 03:59:32 A big plan drafted by China , Russia and Iran was the ongoing oil-yuan scheme that aimed to end of the dollar as hegemony in the world oil trade market , If that was successful , the U.S. would completely lose its influential position .

8117 2018-07-30 03:58:13 Hey man, I let everyone know this before hand. If they choose to show up a boil potatoes in oil instead of frying them because they don't know the simplest shit thats their own damn fault.

8127 2018-07-30 03:56:39 lol you can do it! My suggestion is the less products you use , the better the results! Too much product will weigh your twists down and take longer for them to dry! Just use an oil you like and curl custard !
8128 2018-07-30 03:56:22 Bush Family was oil barrens first!  Can’t trust an oil man!  The Clinton’s and Bushes were all friends so that didn’t help!

8130 2018-07-30 03:56:08 " Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord". ( James 5:14 )
8131 2018-07-30 03:56:01 Maybe you can share those ideas with us, How would you suggest we do that ?

Oh I know, Canadians just bought a pipeline, that will provide a profit stream to create clean energy jobs & retrain our oil workers to a green economy for the future and we don't get taxed to death
8132 2018-07-30 03:56:00 "..mothers are healthier and more likely to survive childbirth, but their children will also be less prone to serious health complications. Palm fruit oil, along with sunflower oil, also maintained breast-milk retinol concentrations"

Alexander Downer ‘Nest Featherer’.
8134 2018-07-30 03:54:47 I personally prefer demutualization over nationalization.

I simply believe people should get a little windfall from our oil.

8145 2018-07-30 03:53:25 Fear is an especially potent form of snake oil. The GOP relies on fear and has it's own TV network to push it.  It's either that or some kind of mass hysteria.

8163 2018-07-30 03:50:34 Do you know of a good writeup on this phenomenon? My intuition is that a lot (but certainly not all) of the billions just went to snake oil salespeople, but I really don't have a good handle on it.
8164 2018-07-30 03:50:32 And she still make more and telling to me hey you should eat my food and the worst habit she does always is put the oil  and fat in every step  

Damn
8165 2018-07-30 03:50:25 Socks, neck pillow, blanket if room permits, large water bottle. Body dehydrates extremely fast in the plane. Also lavender essential oil can be used in combination with the peppermint if you’re prone to headaches. It’s better then taking medicine and the Lavender is soothing
8166 2018-07-30 03:50:16 No facts, just insults, name calling and pro oil propaganda. You have also proven you can't debate.
8167 2018-07-30 03:50:03 I took a tour of Lucas Oil Friday and they just put a new field down (1st one since the stadium opened). Four guys have the job 
Of 8 hours each day scooting across the field on their butt checking every inch of turf with tools and picking extra rubber out.
8168 2018-07-30 03:49:48 As a rule, most people just want a quiet life and are happy to appease others to achieve that. Unfortunately, one or two 'squeaky wheels' play on that and get all the oil!
8169 2018-07-30 03:49:48 With your example, it’s cheaper to pull oil in the Middle East. But the global crude oil is still higher.
8170 2018-07-30 03:49:46 @GlamLifeGuru for the @beautybakerie foundation, did you use their wake & bake face oil??? Because I recently got the foundation, and it works for me when I use their facial oil!

8172 2018-07-30 03:49:41 yeah both parties are the same.

Democrats also support the surveillance of the american people as well. Dems just have better PR than
8173 2018-07-30 03:49:32 we can never know how many nooks and crannies big oil has seeped into until we put it out of business. corporations don't have brains. they just grow into everything around them.

8186 2018-07-30 03:48:10 Is this an oil painting?!!!  Either way it is beautifully done and captures the subject completely, but if this is oil, the painter is a god.
8187 2018-07-30 03:48:04 I was hoping and still think oil will go higher 76-78, then pullback before next leg higher.  Let's see, have to wait on inventory.

8200 2018-07-30 03:46:25 Yes, I'm bullish LT. Maybe a slightly bearish article, but some good info in there. 
Refineries in the US not set up for their grade of oil, that makes them dependent on heavy oil imports. Very bullish, especially the increased exports.

8215 2018-07-30 03:44:23 Mind you I don't think the flight of capital is due to the AB NDP who have been basically the PCs reborn. Nor is it the fault of the Fed Liberals. The tax cuts are tempting. But with all the subsidy in AB plus REDA/Redwater decision why add to the mess with tax cuts? Oil slaves.

I'm 50/50 on UBI myself. I think we should keep our focus on healthcare and education.
8228 2018-07-30 03:42:32 I am not so sure about this BS propaganda stuff you mention. There seems to be reasonable grounds to assume that folks are running off to USA based on the Trump tax cuts and the dearth of oil industry employment in  Calgary. Of course I can't say for sure but it's brutal for some

8232 2018-07-30 03:41:49 It's definitely more socialist than we are. I personally regard the division of countries into "capitalist" and "socialist" as a barbarous relic of the 20th century.

But it's also noteworthy that Norway is an oil state, which makes it not a great comparison for the U.S.
8233 2018-07-30 03:41:44 "the contrived drama created by the NDP"
Wrong. 
The NDP did not kill the oil industry - the global recession did. 
The PCs could have built pipelines to access other markets - they didn't. 
There was no "theft of a pipeline."

8235 2018-07-30 03:40:56 I always knew i was spoiled... but living with my brother; he BUYS the groceries, cooks, wash dishes, takes out the trash, & changes my oil...
8236 2018-07-30 03:40:41 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
8237 2018-07-30 03:40:41 Oil pulling took that icky feeling away but I’m still sneezing like a damn fool.
8238 2018-07-30 03:40:41 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8239 2018-07-30 03:40:40 #GasPrices are indeed inching back up, rising 2c/gal in the last week to $2.85, led primarily by Great Lakes states which saw a large correction at the pump due to tremendous undercutting. Oil holding just under $70/bbl for the time being.
8240 2018-07-30 03:40:33 たらこって美味いよな！
8241 2018-07-30 03:40:30 Thanks oil change! I just got 370 miles on one tank of gas! Hadn’t even had the gas light come on yet either! 
8242 2018-07-30 03:40:22 I would imagine what the oil revenue goes towards and if it's a democratic system of government may play into this. However, I'm also not trapped in Matt or Liz's brains so

8250 2018-07-30 03:39:51 So Jason says now he wants to take away my carbon tax rebate and give it to oil companies? That's what UCP is about?
8251 2018-07-30 03:39:45 He slipped on that oil puddle trying to get out of the way lol The video I seen on YouTube pointed it out right away

8253 2018-07-30 03:39:35 Thought @Mintgecko you are bullish for oil? Or I was wrong?
8254 2018-07-30 03:39:34 Either that or just spray more oil and less heat

8258 2018-07-30 03:39:22 Can not survive without oil at this time. And how about you look at the economy.  What the hell are you going to do when the funds run out? We are losing billions of dollars to countries the dont care at all about the environment. Again you should worry about your own back yard.

8267 2018-07-30 03:37:51 Perfectly Said. Let's go on to the World Stage. The Mullahs might be crying now because They're not going to obtain pallets of cash. Russia might not be selling oil to Those they've always wanted to control & China is in our crosshairs. #AmericaFirst
8268 2018-07-30 03:37:47 Also coconut oil. I’m the queen of knotty hair. I’ve had to do everything.
8269 2018-07-30 03:37:40 We shouldn’t because vit e would only add another layer of oil to the skin since it’s heavy and thick.
8270 2018-07-30 03:37:39 Maybe we can sell off oil rights in Alberta and up North. That is what deregulation and less Gov. would be capable of. Maybe we can sell Hydro one and Site C and buy our resources back from American Corps. Sorry that sounds like a  REALLY STUPID IDEA

8273 2018-07-30 03:37:01 Late evening. Nothing before 730pm. Start with shishitos in a little bit of sesame oil. Bask in the sunlight. Sprinkle peppers with a little flavored salt. Remind yourself of the November days of 20f and clear.
8274 2018-07-30 03:36:43 Seems like every country with a ton of oil wealth per person and a national oil company is socialist by this measure.

And most of them are pretty rich, making it extraordinary that Venezuela could manage to screw up as bad as it has!

The safest way to transport oil is pipelines. We still need oil and produce it as clean as possible. You and Canada

8285 2018-07-30 03:35:50 The BS is very deep. Folks are knee deep in spin. We're stuck paying for a dumb pipeline. This means debt slaves over generations used to pay for oil industry's subsidy.

8288 2018-07-30 03:35:39 I believe the current non working power plant is oil fired. Even if it was working, Israel controls the fuel. If I recall correctly, Gaza ran low on fuel numerous times previous to the current worsening power supply.

8322 2018-07-30 03:29:25 Interesting information in that previous Forbes article that speculation likely accounts for 20-30% of the oil price. At the last oil spike in 2008, there were eight times more “paper trades” on NYMEX and ICE than actual global oil production. #OOTT

8377 2018-07-30 03:19:49 I like to preheat and wipe down with oil. Helps keep stuff from sticking and then once food is done and its still hot I'll hot it with a grill brush or a cleaning pad then oil again

8386 2018-07-30 03:17:36 My electric wok hits 375 guaranteed on its highest setting, and a quart of oil is enough to cook a good bit of food in. Not great at wok hei, but it's kind of perfect as a deep fryer for 2-3 people. I use it for my falafel

8391 2018-07-30 03:17:01 Buhari is planning to establish a refinery in katsina which does not have any oil. Why?self interest?
8392 2018-07-30 03:16:48 Women aren't bricklayers or oil rig workers or roofers because of gender stereotypes....riiight.

8404 2018-07-30 03:14:49 I bought some of the @beardbrand ‘s beard oil the other day. The only down side is when the oil is warm it becomes a liquid and will seep through the jar and ruin your entire over night toiletries bag. Never buying this again. Thanks for ruining my favorite bag.

8412 2018-07-30 03:13:18 It absolutely boggles my mind that the us justified launching a massive invasion in the 90s to fight Saddam Hussein on behalf of Kuwait because he was committing a landgrab for oil yet the us is not only allowing Kurdish forces to do same in syria, but supporting them...

8492 2018-07-30 03:00:08 Sorry to hear this...migraines are seriously the worst. A cold ice pack on the back of neck, or take a hot bath with lavender. If if you can, 1000mg of Tylenol (real Tylenol) and a Mexican coke. Get some peppermint oil, put some on the back of your neck and behind your ears.

8501 2018-07-30 02:58:24 They need some water with baby oil in it
8502 2018-07-30 02:58:09 Okay, so I have combination skin and I use a wash from clean & clean for like 5 dollars. For toner I use witch hazel. I then use diluted tea tree oil then apply acne Cream from clean and clear. In the winter i use a sleep face mask from freeman, that has chamomile in it.

8517 2018-07-30 02:53:54 i was putting on medicated oil.    and then i rubbed my eye
8518 2018-07-30 02:53:53 Stay hydrated! Rub some peppermint oil on your temples temporarily  if you have any
8519 2018-07-30 02:53:38 Thank you! The best comment so far. Let him go and work not smear their opponents. Era of hate politics will soon be over!
8520 2018-07-30 02:53:35 I wonder if she has to wash her hair after @realDonaldTrump leans on her with his 10W-40 hair oil.
8521 2018-07-30 02:53:16 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
8522 2018-07-30 02:53:08 Okay nice. Density, viscosity, at fluid dynamics pala yung science behind Oil Drop Timer experiment na yun

SNAKE OIL HERE!!!
8526 2018-07-30 02:51:34 Was definitely a little groggy when I cooked my meal just now as I apparently put my olive oil back in the fridge... 
8527 2018-07-30 02:51:33 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/ Porn on demand, oil in hand, with this chant I summon Woundman ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/
8528 2018-07-30 02:51:29 I wanna be showered in diamonds while laying on silk sheets while wearing a silk slip dress and body glowing in tom ford soleil blanc shimmer oil in greece
8529 2018-07-30 02:51:16 Oh. I clicked on that and lost a little of my faith in humanity.
8530 2018-07-30 02:51:13 Israel wants to take over southern Lebanon for water and Golan and part of Syria for oil ,  Iran supports hezbollah and Assad blocking those plans , so don’t try bullshitting someone with fake concern about Iranian children ,
8531 2018-07-30 02:51:08 His mind is like an engine that went too long without an oil change.
8532 2018-07-30 02:50:49 Lmao. Take a face cloth, run it under hot water, as hot as you can stand it, then place it on your face until it cools. Then remove the mask. If it doesn’t get it all off, use oil (coconut or vitamin E).
8533 2018-07-30 02:50:46 Bullshit.

You support a president who refuses to condemn Kim and Putin, criticizes our own intelligence services and chose Russian oil money over his country. 

You're a traitor.  Deal with that.
8534 2018-07-30 02:50:37 Amen. I have some blessed and anointed oil in my house.
8535 2018-07-30 02:50:29 To you all that are the fighters out there I am sorry that I didnt ship out this past week as I was very busy. I am at the post office tomorrow morning to deliver your much needed oil packages!!! Will be there soon, sorry
8536 2018-07-30 02:50:03 I need to buy an essential oil diffuser
8537 2018-07-30 02:49:51 No matter how much I try to hear "oil can" I really think the Tinman was screaming "HELP ME!"
8538 2018-07-30 02:49:51 Whose oil will be refined there?

8542 2018-07-30 02:49:17 rub lavender or peppermint oil on them.
8543 2018-07-30 02:49:14 oddly enough, the suffering of Venezuelan and Syrian children seem to rate well with the defense contractors and oil companies subsidizing the network

8545 2018-07-30 02:49:03 So explain how they make windmills with no fossil fuels? Pretty hard to make steel with good thoughts. Then let's talk about the pollution lithium batteries make. That terrible Alberta oil kept this country a float. Getting it to market benefits everyone including you.
8546 2018-07-30 02:48:46 TOO COOL. Auto Shop??? No way. Way!!!/ now I know where to go to get my oil changed by someone I trust
8547 2018-07-30 02:48:42 The Pope's meeting with oil executives back in June, and his comments about the dangers of fossil fuels, is remarkable. 

Gee, what do you think: would he be in favor of letting Enbridge replace Line 5 with an even bigger tunnel, one that could carry tar sands oil??
8548 2018-07-30 02:48:17 Oil field job interview tomorrow hope it goes well 
8549 2018-07-30 02:48:15 Beautiful, but it felt ominous. It made me think of the line from that Midnight Oil song, 

How do we sleep while our beds are burning?
8550 2018-07-30 02:48:13 Look at all of the plastic.  All made from oil.
8551 2018-07-30 02:48:08 What a mess the global economic system has created. It's a constant global economic war over the price of oil and the value of currencies. Because of greed and the desire for power over other countries. Now other countries, banks, and investment firms have some control over us.
8552 2018-07-30 02:48:08 Venezuela’s socialism didn’t work because of their economy. They relied way too heavily on oil and their economy was not diverse. I’m not defending socialism but Venezuela is a bad example of why it doesn’t work.
8553 2018-07-30 02:48:05 I have it on good authority that dogs do NOT like peppermint oil.

8557 2018-07-30 02:47:48 The world uses 80-million+ barrels of oil/day. A 5% drop in economy = drop of 4-million+/day. 10% = 8-million+.

Remember how hard it was for Russia & OPEC to cut 1.7 million barrels/day between them.

Imagine what demand drop of 4 to 8 million barrels/day would do to them.
8558 2018-07-30 02:47:31 Her solution is court packing?  Might stand the test of 1 generation maybe 2,  but not the test of time.

8563 2018-07-30 02:46:58 I’ve cooked them in butter or oil before and seasoned with garlic powder or a chicken seasoning blend
8564 2018-07-30 02:46:52 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with cheese.

8566 2018-07-30 02:46:06 Does anyone else use coconut oil religiously or is it just me??
8567 2018-07-30 02:46:03 It occurred to me the other day that the scope of PRC ambitions re the SCS is likely commensurate with the immense political capital expended in building the islands, blowing off UNCLOS, etc. IMO it's prob bigger than fish or Spratly oil - something worth blowing up US relations.

8583 2018-07-30 02:43:48 For Christians, in fact, it is, in general, quite the opposite.
8584 2018-07-30 02:43:39 Stop quoting Koch propaganda. It's utter garbage and more importantly it's not true. That helps you feel good about supporting the oil business?
8585 2018-07-30 02:43:32 All you gotta do is start cooking with it again and it’ll season itself. Or put some oil in and bake it. If there’s rust, take it off with steel wool. Cast iron is FOREVER. 

But really, long pig is best over an open fire on a spit. #cookingtipsfromghoul

8603 2018-07-30 02:39:56 Absolutely! For instance, when I go to get an oil change and get asked if I know I need wiper fluid & where it is?

8609 2018-07-30 02:39:07 Though my parents insist I don't have food allergies and that I'm just paranoid, when I eat certain things (usually made with peanut oil) I feel like there's a hand around my throat.

8656 2018-07-30 02:29:46 Good point. I never thought about how the removal of so much oil & sludge could change things underground. We have probably changed the geological & biological ecosystem down there. Above ground, 1B of us propel 2000-lb cars with it everyday. Of course it changes the air/temp.

8663 2018-07-30 02:28:35 Nothing is more annoying than the oil poppn when ya frying
8664 2018-07-30 02:28:17 I can tell, gears flying everywhere, oil leaks n shit. Friggin maniac!
8665 2018-07-30 02:28:09 So I got 3 sets of essential oil roller balls at Elder Berrman today for $16 bucks and I’ve never been happier
8666 2018-07-30 02:28:00 動いた
8667 2018-07-30 02:27:25 just waiting for when people finally realize coconut oil isn’t as good for your hair as everyone says
8668 2018-07-30 02:27:18 Sure Jason. What a "IPOCRITE". Natural beauty of our province always goes better  with an oil pipe, an open tar sand pit mine and runoff tailings pond all over the place. Why don't you tell it the way it is, JASON.
8669 2018-07-30 02:27:17 aku baca di beningbersinar kalau micellar itu gabisa jadi 1st cleanser, dia bantu bersihin makeup aja jadi 1st cleanser tetep oil based / milk cleanser ituu. Jadii kalau mau mw > mc > toner

8677 2018-07-30 02:26:04 Omg yes! Essentially everything that's here already  I've been told from drink more water, stop eating fried food, chips, and chocolate, to b on the pill, to put Vicks, to put birth control as face mask, to wait it out, it's just a phase, to tree tea oil, and to wash face
8678 2018-07-30 02:25:27 While simultaneously ignoring Obama and Uranium One; EU's dependence on Russian Oil & Gas; Russia not wanting missile defense in E. Europe; invasions of Georgia, Ukraine, Crimea and Syria, and shutting down investigations into election interference. You're a real Sherlock, Bill.
8679 2018-07-30 02:25:15 just woke up with an LSS to the ministop jingle and if this isn't ministop chicken oil running through my veins idk what it is

8680 2018-07-30 02:25:15 Guess you've never seen pincher creek. Miles of windmills. They are oil sands big difference. Maybe have a look at the reclaimed mines. The oil was leeching into the athabasca river until mined and stopped. You are incredibly naive, I'll bet you enjoy free healthcare and other

8682 2018-07-30 02:24:55 He’s doing well so far so good but the election could decide where it goes if dems get in well No more gravy train biscuit and wheels ppl from the steel mill r back to work the oil refinery meat etc
8683 2018-07-30 02:24:50 Peer-reviewed climate science is real & #CA48 is situated along the California coast ... you do the math!

How is it possible that our MoC is both a climate-change denier & supports offshore oil drilling?

Ol’ Dana endangers all #CA48 residents!

8684 2018-07-30 02:24:29 Pretty sure it gives the pasta extra flavour, my mum can always taste the difference and I've started to be able to too. Also IIRC if you put olive oil in the water it stops the pasta sticking together when you strain it but I've never bothered with that.
8685 2018-07-30 02:24:27 Spaghetti, tinned tuna in oil, flat leaf parsley, capers, dried chilli.  In my world it’s called ‘cat tuna’ cause it turns cheap tuna into a gourmet meal (the trick is fry the tuna flakes til crispy)
8686 2018-07-30 02:24:26 I’m gonna try to catch the van one more time. My boy loves the flat bills.
8687 2018-07-30 02:24:07 Thanks. Add dal, oil and salt to food security act.
8688 2018-07-30 02:23:23 Had this Jamaican Castor Oil on my hair for only a few hours and seriously can already tell the difference in my locs! 
8689 2018-07-30 02:22:54 Warm bath, hot oil and home made organic malunggay tea. I love Mondays. #rdfeels
8690 2018-07-30 02:22:45 Coconut oil works just as well and it doesnt get weird after a while.
8691 2018-07-30 02:22:33 If CBD oil is available where you are it may be worth a try. I’m a nurse and we’ve found it works very well on nerve and muscle issues. Once that disc area has been breeched or irritated it will fire up nerves for a while. Hope you find relief soon!
8692 2018-07-30 02:22:26 Unless they get the awesome economics of the“poor” moms like most of us had:yum!English muffins, olive oil, sauce and some cheeses-and oregano. Economize, bring joy to your children, and let us hope for more “little pizzas” soon.We didn’t know we were “poor”. Because we weren’t.
8693 2018-07-30 02:22:18 i’ve been needing an oil change but im also craving ihop sooooo

8696 2018-07-30 02:22:13 "Hope"?! Dude, with the depth of trouble you're  in you're gonna need more than that. You outta be praying, meditating, fasting, doing yoga, hugging trees, volunteering at homeless shelters, getting your head annointed with oil, rebuking demons , knitting for old ladies.
8697 2018-07-30 02:22:07 buying an oil diffuser was easily the best decision i’ve ever made
8698 2018-07-30 02:22:04 Talkin slick like its oil speakin’ 
8699 2018-07-30 02:21:56 Okay I have my oil diffuser going and I’m watching Netflix while cuddling with Rose. This is what I live for 
8700 2018-07-30 02:21:51 Try peppermint oil.
8701 2018-07-30 02:21:44 No oil or money involved
8702 2018-07-30 02:21:38 But is it oil free?
8703 2018-07-30 02:21:30 I wish I still had the notebooks I made when I worked as a DOE endangered species biologist on what used to be Elk Hills Oil Reserve, near @AllieBBogart.  I gathered data, drew maps, added illustrations....tried to answer driving ??  IAN are not the same, but certainly similar.
8704 2018-07-30 02:21:14 ...to come in and harvest our resources at laughably small tax rates.  Billions of dollars for oil companies, crappy roads and broken down schools for Alberta residents.  #abpoli
8705 2018-07-30 02:21:08 Note: I said could replace. Never said there are. Your argument is we will always need oil for x,y and z. Which isn't true. Anything made with crude oil, can also be made with hemp oil, including plastics, clothings, etc. This is public knowledge.

8711 2018-07-30 02:19:41 Just a reminder I’m speaking with @erickolb @J0hnnyXm4s  and more @CircleCityCon pals at @Gen_Con Indianapolis this Thursday at 8PM in Lucas Oil Stadium. HFD is prior. Both are sold out, but we do accept generics and you can ping me WRT dinner openings. Lots of fun planned!
8712 2018-07-30 02:19:39 At least he doesn't have to sell snake oil to pay the bills
8713 2018-07-30 02:19:26 you know what’s super good, sprinkling parmesan and a little olive oil on some kale and baking it. They’re like chips. SO good.

8715 2018-07-30 02:19:01 ありがとうございますがんばります
8716 2018-07-30 02:18:21 You really need to read some history books to get to grips with what we've done in the past. Especially since the discovery of oil in the early part of the last century.

I didn't say anything about western imperialism. We've imposed despots & stolen their resources. Simple.
8717 2018-07-30 02:18:17 My hair dry I need to oil it
8718 2018-07-30 02:18:16 Fresh better oil. Masha Allah

8720 2018-07-30 02:18:00 Anything's a bottle of oil if you're brazen enough.
8721 2018-07-30 02:17:53 Is there oil or drugs to take?
8722 2018-07-30 02:17:46 Coz Jen unfortunately doesn't oil people like other does and she don't have good PR team as well. Jen deserves better yar
8723 2018-07-30 02:17:29 Snake oil doesn’t sell itself; PT Barnum had more than a few words to say on this very subject...
8724 2018-07-30 02:17:28 He did lose and he's accomplished a lot for the top 1% and gas and oil industries by repealing environmental regulations and land restrictions.  I don't see the rich getting richer and destruction of our planet as a positive. He's an embarrassment, as are you

8726 2018-07-30 02:17:07 This was the best bath yet. Eucalyptus epsom salt, lavender and peppermint oil. I feel like a noodle.
8727 2018-07-30 02:17:06 Does CBD oil make any difference?
8728 2018-07-30 02:16:57 まぁ行く人いないし自分で補完してるんですがね…
8729 2018-07-30 02:16:57 1 owner, clean car fax, stock engine, oil changes done way more often then they needed to be done
8730 2018-07-30 02:16:37 They took the oil fields, nationalized the company, and fired experts in extraction to give the jobs to favored but less competent people. When virtual all of your resources come from one source you don't need to control more than that to exert national control.

8733 2018-07-30 02:16:28 Warm water works. I'm not sure I'd want tea tree oil anywhere near delicate bits. I might use a body wash on my inner thighs, but once you get to where things are delicate, you want warm water.

8751 2018-07-30 02:13:13 It is, I agree. And tbh, the fact that beliefs, practices and communities that genuinely help people to grow and heal and become better get painted with the same brush as superficial, harmful and weaponized religious nonsense really sucks. Squeaky wheel gets the oil, always
8752 2018-07-30 02:13:09 i make a flowing lyric poem to make you yearn for palm oil
8753 2018-07-30 02:12:56 Here’s a summer protip. Massage your head with peppermint oil. Grows your hair with a remarkably long lasting cooling effect. Like an icy mint for your  whole body.
8754 2018-07-30 02:12:25 Probablemente no saldría más barato, importar nafta sale lo mismo casi que producirla acá. El gas es acá más barato que importarlo, el fuel oil tambn, el único que sería más caro importar es el gas oil
8755 2018-07-30 02:12:10 I thought my sarcasm was obvious
8756 2018-07-30 02:12:00 Love making that oil patch money 
8757 2018-07-30 02:11:50 Oh, that is lovely! A wonderful example of early, portable CVS: cures vs snake oil. 
8758 2018-07-30 02:11:48 1. Castor Oil

ICastor oil is used not only for increasing growth of eyelashes, but also for growing your hair and for eyebrows too! It contains beneficial antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which in combination with a rich source of nutrients aids in hair growth.
8759 2018-07-30 02:11:43 That's not hard to do, butter has a low smoke point. Add in some natural oil like canola or vegetable so it can be used for frying.
8760 2018-07-30 02:11:23 Seagulls are very obviously in the employ of big oil. $TSLA lie #745,966,720 or about 5k per week
8761 2018-07-30 02:11:12 Funny. I was just looking for a new brand of oil to use. I bet all of your followers and listeners were too. What a coincidence.
8762 2018-07-30 02:11:10 I try to read the label on my food. Soybean oil is in just about everything from ice cream to salad dressing. You can have all you want.

8783 2018-07-30 02:07:09 CBD oil has changed the game for my mental health and I could not be more happy 
8784 2018-07-30 02:06:54 With 15,000 oil and gas businesses in Calgary alone, the Star's advertisers are going to stop advertising until you learn about oil and gas.

8797 2018-07-30 02:05:18 Nope, full nationalization of production and the firing of experts in the drilling field led to an over reliance on oil without the ability to repair infrastructure. Before Chavez Venezuela was a net food exporter. They became socialist was the problem.

8801 2018-07-30 02:04:44 Gas prices are trending downward. Oil is likely to drop further.

8950 2018-07-30 01:39:12 The earth can shake us off like a bad case of fleas. Just remember, oil is natural and it has been flowing and burning long before us.
8951 2018-07-30 01:39:10 I could’ve just changed my oil on the lifts at work but here I am on the ground

8955 2018-07-30 01:38:47 Downer pulled Oz out of Int'l Court of Justice and Int'l Tribunal on the Law of the Sea, forcing Timor-Leste to negotiate oil treaty with Oz; illegally ordered ASIS bugging of the negotiation; took a well paid "consultancy" with Woodside Petroleum. Conspiracy, fraud and bribery.
8956 2018-07-30 01:38:22 Eh, some dems are better than others when it comes to oil. Overall, the party is better at working to combat climate change than the Republicans which are far more involved with fossil fuels than the democratic party has in the past few decades. Most dems don't take said money.

8959 2018-07-30 01:38:11 And what sabotage would that be? No oil embargo. Nobody forced them to nationalize whole industries, or siphon profits to a connected elite WITHIN the government. You can't blame VZ failure on America.

You seem to think defending VZ is a part of defending socialism. It isn't.
8960 2018-07-30 01:38:06 Dude look like somebody bust him in the head wit a waterbaloon full of olive oil ! Lololol
8961 2018-07-30 01:38:01 Wait, so do you cook the rice with the olive oil and garlic? Or do you add them to the already cooked rice?
8962 2018-07-30 01:37:43 IF climate change did exist and if it happen to make the world a better place, ie some cold states/countries had more agriculture or better tourism or smaller deserts, would we pay Big Oil a commission?

8965 2018-07-30 01:37:09 Interesting observation! They are living on Hope- and hes playing into it like a Carnie or Snake oil salesman!
8966 2018-07-30 01:36:18 Not since the #British exchanged silver for opium has another nation done what #Russia was able to do to most of #Europe.

8967 2018-07-30 01:36:16 No you're a hypocrite for using oil products while bashing oil. Facts are green products need fossil fuels to manufacture. Facts are Canada is carbon neutral. Facts are you need to transport materials to make windmills and solar panels. Facts are we need oil at this time. Facts

8975 2018-07-30 01:33:39 They are so stupid: they could jump on the bandwagon and work on R&D on cbd oil and make money and help people. They won't because of some stupid stigma attached to reefer madness. No relation here folks!
8976 2018-07-30 01:33:34 I believe you. I've only recently discovered dipping crusty bread in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, though. So I may be behind the times.
8977 2018-07-30 01:33:32 a bunch of oil was under the screen frame so i guess when i had it in the kitchen with me while i was cooking oil popped from the pan onto the screen and then it settled under the bezel which made my screen stop working....i'll just be more careful from now on

8996 2018-07-30 01:28:35 On an operational level, it raises the question of where they are moving their oil income. Almost all global oil sales are USD-denominated. If they aren't going to buy US Treasuries, where are those dollars going? And who or what currency is now getting their business?

9003 2018-07-30 01:27:06 The last time we cut off an Asian rival nation's oil supplies, it did not end without war.  Complacency regarding what is happening & what is actually driving it is quite fascinating (& frightening) to me.

9024 2018-07-30 01:22:54 So today an insert in my bra ruptured and started slowly, steadily leaking oil all over my dress, and I had no idea there was a liquid component to my bra so I thought I was just oozing oil, and kinda just resigned myself to it, so that was my day

9058 2018-07-30 01:17:53 He wanted coal to stop being used for power plants. Since that’s not the only use for coal, he did not say he wanted the industry to fail.
Oh, and on their own now, most utilities are retiring coal as fuel in favor of gas.
And he did not try to destroy the oil & gas industries.

9063 2018-07-30 01:17:17 We(by which I mean I), do not know how to measure the misery caused by Exxon and Apple respectively, but my (admittedly anecdotal) sense is that Exxon(or maybe the oil industry in general) has a far, far worse reputation that colors how people view their profits vs. Apple’s.

This economy is President Trump economy. You are a leaking liar and fraud.
9066 2018-07-30 01:16:36 When the price of fuel cranks up drastically due to war or disaster, EVs won’t fill the gap. The infrastructure still lags and this administration won’t do jack about that. It’s the Grand Oil Party, after all …

9072 2018-07-30 01:15:34 So since this claim the people in agreement are now using a horse and buggy because of this narrative?  It an unrealistic claim. When the oil or gasoline is provided to you those companies never said you had to use it in a manner that would destroy the planet. Your responsible!
9073 2018-07-30 01:15:30 They should use the same type of booms they use for oil spills to create no water craft runways on the lake and ticket the hell out of the boaters causing the problems.

9082 2018-07-30 01:13:32 Bert, Obama said during his speeches he wanted the Coal industry to fail. He refused to do anything about Tariffs that were destroying our Steel and Aluminum industries.

9087 2018-07-30 01:13:05 Goddamnit I put too much peppermint oil in my bath and my pus lips feels like they’ve been dipped in acid.
9088 2018-07-30 01:12:45 I'm picturing horny hoofy talons & concrete hard callouses caked in massage oil sinisterly slowly closing in on me ragged toes waggling maniacally as i holler for help opposite the opposite denver west mall... sigh.sounds like a steal for 25$ tbh

9090 2018-07-30 01:12:18 Do not brush hair when wet. Eat sardines for shiny hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. I truly want to get to the bottom of something. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to curb hair loss. or very close to. What must I do to determine the official web page.
9091 2018-07-30 01:12:17 I knew someone who bought a brand new mower & put gas in it & didn't put oil in it & wondered why it broke the first day.

9093 2018-07-30 01:11:46 My son was treated with the max dose. They were very careful to target only his cancer. He did get a slight sunburn once and the treatment damaged his thyroid gland which was near the tumor but nothing other than that. Might have been mega dose vit e and shark over oil protected
9094 2018-07-30 01:11:38 What information is not in that table that shows one party is NOT like the other?  Handful of Dems in oil country, but it's mostly Republicans.  And they routinely vote against measures to rein in GHGs.  It's not rocket science, it's straightforward bribery.

9105 2018-07-30 01:10:06 Sorry about your fur baby.  Find a local groomer or your vet that can sand the nail down using a dremel.  If your fur baby has anxiety with the pedicure check into the CBD oil for them.  Hope your pooch feels better
9106 2018-07-30 01:10:06 is your skin sensitive? because mine is SUPER sensitive and the almond oil is the only thing I’ve found that really hydrates and doesn’t break me out at all!! I even use it before makeup and it makes everything glide on so smoothly!!

9114 2018-07-30 01:08:40 It is absolutely due to internal policies.
A nation rich in oil can't put milk on the shelves.
It happened in Cuba, NK, Russia, East Germany, Poland, Chekoslovakia, Hungary, the list goes on and on.
Socialism fails bc it goes against human nature. It is a beautiful LIE!

Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by EOY.

9123 2018-07-30 01:07:48 Here is why you are wrong. It is only half the story. You cannot estimate costs without also calculating benefits. That would be like calculating the cost of regular oil changes without factoring in the decrease in repairs costs and depreciation oil changes bring.

9127 2018-07-30 01:07:19 It's a mini convection oven. Instead of using oil to fry food, it uses super heated air. So healthy(ish).

9129 2018-07-30 01:06:05 Too funny! I eat an above average amount of spinach, my favorite way right now is evoo, pinch of salt & a couple glugs of sir racha oil.

I actually use baking soda and vitamin e oil. Coconut actually broke me out 
9139 2018-07-30 01:04:54 I wash my face with any oil free soap, put witch hazel on when it dries, and put Olay moisturizer. Oily skin is the worst.

Russia [2016-Present]
Saudi Arabia [2001]
Both of which make most of heir money from oil.
If America got off oil, both of those countries would be much less able to attack us again

9162 2018-07-30 01:01:38 California is burning up-partially because of climate change.  Florida has a deadly algae bloom, directly related to rising temperatures and pollution. Trump is trying to reduce CA air pollution standards to help the oil industry. Putting profits over people health
9163 2018-07-30 01:01:28 Potato quarters or (on lesser spoon days) potato halfs. Just sprinkled with oil and premixed spices or just salt/pepper, about 15-25mins at about 200 degree in the oven.

9165 2018-07-30 01:01:03 How pathetic is it when oil protesters use oil based products. Oil spills happen, and do get cleaned up.

9173 2018-07-30 01:00:05 It's easy! You need:
4 Roma Tomatoes
1/2 of large onion
A few garlic gloves
2 large spoonfuls of:
Knorr tomato bouillon
Knorr chicken bouillon

Blend all the above in a Blender with a splash of water until homogenous. Set aside. 

Saute 2 cups of rice with oil until light brown.

9182 2018-07-30 00:58:47 if doing so reduces risk to our marine and freshwater environments then that would be the approach we should be looking for. 

As for your Lac Megantic argument, since the oil will displace oil-by-rail  it will reduce the chance of another disaster

Also lying down with sleep mask to block all light helps too

A louder chuckle came and he slowly pulled to look at Soji.
9218 2018-07-30 00:53:00 I use Japanese mint oil for any pain I get. It is pretty strong so if you are sensitive to smells you might want to dilute it or stray away from it though. A warm shower with good pressure can act kind of like a massage too.

9222 2018-07-30 00:52:39 Great, now do Venezuela. Are you saying those working class people weren't exploited? Now you will bring up Scandinavian countries. But wait, aren't you against the elimination of the need of oil because of climate change? What happens if those their massive profits from oil.

9228 2018-07-30 00:51:40 Seems the work of speculators as not much has changed. Iran needs to sell more oil to China.
9229 2018-07-30 00:51:30 It would take more energy and cause more pollution for the current technology of automotive industry to transform everything away from oil.. so I have heard.
9230 2018-07-30 00:51:12 Okay so I’ve always had oily skin and I wonder if it’s because my skin is in fact dry so it overproduces oil to hydrate itself?? Does that make sense? Should I try a moisturizer? HALP, IDK HOW ADULT.
9231 2018-07-30 00:50:47 I certainly didn't polish off a bottle of rum so I could turn the bottle into an oil lamp, if that's what you're implying.

9238 2018-07-30 00:50:28 ,you need some of that natural oil
washing every 2 days helps keep your hair nice and you should find the proper product for your hair, cause sometimes the reason your hair is too oily is cause the products strip your hair of its natural oils and so it doubles the amount it needs
9239 2018-07-30 00:50:28 And they declined the offer to become "oil boys".

9245 2018-07-30 00:49:33 If the diaper rash is especially irritated by the rubbing necessary for  proper hygiene, then using a non-sticky cream (such as  Vaseline) as a barrier may be important. If sticky stool hinders hygiene, it may be more easily removed after application  of mineral oil to the area.
9246 2018-07-30 00:49:32 Almost experienced a cardiac event while grocery shopping because I walked by Anna Kendrick near the olive oil, but I’m fine
9247 2018-07-30 00:49:16 Yes sir.  There are a lot of things I never realized I did wrong that killed it when I grew it before.  Hell, I’m just now using oil.

9255 2018-07-30 00:48:01 Also,  it is pathetic how pro pipeline supporters keep whining about tankers of Saudi oil and pipelines being safe when there have been numerous cases of pipelines leaking and causing oil spills like the one in that leaked into the Saskatchewan R. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

9257 2018-07-30 00:47:45 - Do a bunch of face masks to give your skin a nice glow.
- Use a lip scrub to make your lips softer.
- Put coconut oil on your eyebrows and lashes nightly for growth.
- start a new sleep schedule.
- Remember that its not a about looks, you’re there to learn.

9258 2018-07-30 00:47:44 Many of the ndp members have anti oil views but still push a pipeline. It is possible  to have personal opinions but not try and push an agenda. If ndp followed their true view there would be no chance of pipelines which isn’t true.

9262 2018-07-30 00:47:31 I’m half Italian so I was not raised to measure. But two suggestions- if you get a recipe where the only liquid is olive oil, replace half with lemon juice. And walnuts work as well as pine nuts for future batches.

9268 2018-07-30 00:46:45 I wonder if the pro LGBT community is pushing for boycotts of Russian goods, since Russia is horrible when it comes to LGBT rights. Or if they protest Saudi oil, since it is a crime to be gay in SA. Probably not, since it is easier to attack a chicken sandwich shop.
9269 2018-07-30 00:46:44 You wrote a great & honest piece that put a part of your real self out there, a process which sometimes (for me, anyway) brings a bit of self-loathing blowback. 

Also, maybe find a fun new olive oil, like from Crete, or Corsica, for finishing gazpacho for a well-deserved treat.

9309 2018-07-30 00:39:58 A lot of people mistakenly interchange homeopathy with naturopathy. The latter is often also very anecdotal, but has potential for legitimacy — many drugs are derived from plants. The former (homeopathy) is just snake oil.

Arborio rice, onions, vegetable(chicken/veal/beef/fish) stock or light broth (careful with salt), olive oil, butter, Parmesan cheese, white wine (optional), pepper.

Trump tweeted for years that we should pull out of Afghanistan while Obama was president. 

And the GOP barely blinked when G.W. Bush tried negotiating with the Taliban (pre-9/11) for an oil pipeline route.
9366 2018-07-30 00:31:24 今日はやる気があるから、カフェで寝てから頑張るぞ！？？？？
9367 2018-07-30 00:31:22 My owners? Stop fooling urself, we all need oil. Answer a basic economics question. What happens when any co’s costs increase & they need 2 satisfy shareholders?

9370 2018-07-30 00:31:07 Children in cages, premiums, gas prices up, tax cuts which only benefit the rich, destroying our lands for oil profits, etc.  etc.. SO MUCH WINNING! Oh, and weakening our relationships with allies and bending over for Putin. Oh, and NK is still a threat.

9372 2018-07-30 00:30:46 Whip together 1/3 cup cereal with 4 cups chicken. Mix into  Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta
9373 2018-07-30 00:30:38 The Panzers finally got to the oil fields but they were destroyed by the Russians, so he turned them around AGAIN and sent them to Stalingrad too late to save the rest of the army
9374 2018-07-30 00:30:35 I could bet it isn't. Really nothing they said so far makes any sense or suggests any kind of effort or expertise in the matter. They keep contradicting themselves over and over. It is genuine snake oil in my opinion.

9381 2018-07-30 00:29:52 Hitler sent everyone from Moscow to the south to capture the Oil fields, then turned them around and sent them at Stalingrad, then changed his mind and sent the Panzers to the oil fields alone, then turned the Panzers back towards Stalingrad, the back to the oil fields.

9384 2018-07-30 00:29:40 It’s 38.5 C in my yard. The time to listen to you @BlairKing_ca & @politicalham rationalize expanding production - the equivalent of tossing gas on a fire - passed long ago. Your oil induced coma prevents you from seeing systems fail outside your door. We need your help, not oil.
9385 2018-07-30 00:29:07 Oh! Well that changes everything! 

Let’s increase oil tanker shipments through Metro Vancouver by 15X’s so that oil companies can get world prices. Who cares about oil fires much greater than Lac-Mégantic, wiping out people, whales and fish!

9399 2018-07-30 00:25:59 Funny Obama allowed Russia to take a large presence in the Middle East during his admin. Also Russia invaded other countries to take control of the flow of oil into Europe under Obama’s watch. Hilary & Obama sold our Uranium to Russia. What has happened with this admin exactly?
9400 2018-07-30 00:25:56 What a scam this is. “The people” are in no hurry to convert to horses and buggies and few are buying electric cars. When “big oil” gets a “big pollution bill” we will be paying it. What a scam. People are so dumb to think that somehow the oil companies will pay and we won’t.
9401 2018-07-30 00:25:37 If a free and open market actually worked oil companies wouldn’t need subsidies and as well as farmers not to mention. If socialist programs don’t work then tell all your friends parents to send there social security cheques back.

9421 2018-07-30 00:21:52 I also use lotion as well. I dont recommend it as much as unscented baby oil since the oil is so good for the skin and lashes and the perfume in lotion can irritate the eyes but it definitely works!

9482 2018-07-30 00:12:15 Socialist-Marxist societies had not a better impact at all. A socialist system inevitably will need even more to exploit nature (as the Soviet indeed did) due to the economic  inefficiency of any Marxist model to sustain its population economically (beyond the use of oil).

9508 2018-07-30 00:09:35 A larger US military and nato, increased us oil/gas production, US weapons in Ukraine and Poland? Didn’t know those things were what Putin wants..
9509 2018-07-30 00:09:25 Half the car needs to be taken apart to change the oil
9510 2018-07-30 00:09:22 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
9511 2018-07-30 00:08:55 No it means access to world prices because the oil can be bid on by any buyer. That means they get more money for it, even if it only goes to Puget Sound.
9512 2018-07-30 00:08:54 What brands/ products do y’all use to moisturize your body when you get out the shower. Any good products for dry skin? Don’t tell me coconut oil ion feel like it
9513 2018-07-30 00:08:31 anyone know what $$$ he made out of the oil and gas dispute with Timor Leste?
9514 2018-07-30 00:08:30 I'm going through this weird food phase where all I want is macaroni noodles in olive oil with just plain sundried tomatoes. I woke up this morning and needed it.
9515 2018-07-30 00:08:28 We know that. Trump is a snake oil salesman! Cohen and Trump are both crooks and Rudy, he just can't keep up. Rudy looks like a fool, but then he always was a fool!

9519 2018-07-30 00:08:10 バターチキンおいしい。。。
ナンは単体でも甘みが感じられて美味しい。ついつい食べ過ぎてしまう
9520 2018-07-30 00:07:56 Lol! The president tweeted how he “hoped” OPEC wouldn’t raise prices. He claims to be winning but he’s not. That Saudi $100M donation to his daughter’s “charity” is interesting.  We export oil. Why doesn’t he keep it here? #AmericaFirst? Nope. It’s #profits first for his ilk.

9524 2018-07-30 00:07:15 What kinds of food do you like to use? :0 I see scallions, sweet potato, egg, and coconut oil but want to know if you have any other recommendations
9525 2018-07-30 00:07:09 3:1 (THC:CBD) oil drops by Papa & Barkley. You can get them at dispensaries and they work like morphine according to testimonies!
9526 2018-07-30 00:07:08 Update:  Almost there.  Hickory Smoked Prime Rib.  Asparagus in the basket, with sesame oil, salt, cracked pepper and toasted sesame oil.
9527 2018-07-30 00:07:08 I swear coconut oil is magic.
Makeup remover? Coconut oil. 
Paint remover? Coconut oil.
Dry skin? Coconut oil. 
Hair won’t grow? Coconut oil. 
Food sticking to pan? Coconut oil. 
Bland tasting? Coconut oil. 
Stupid boys? Okay not THAT magical
9528 2018-07-30 00:07:05 I've been putting clove oil on it!! and taking strong painkillers and strong antibiotics!
9529 2018-07-30 00:06:41 Access to tidewater means loading oil in an oil tanker and sailing it through one of North America’s most densely populated cities more than once each day. It means the same thing and supports what @JustinTrudeau repeatedly says! @BlairWhichProject
9530 2018-07-30 00:06:38 That’s stuff I never tried pickled. 

We’re trying to figure out how to pickle hot peppers like this one Italian restaurant we used to eat at. They were hot peppers with Italian seasoning in oil. They were simply but good.
9531 2018-07-30 00:06:38 You've clearly never had government cheese. I'm pretty sure it's made from salt, oil, and plastic then enriched with vitamins. Unsure about the vitamin part.
9532 2018-07-30 00:06:37 Some girls want dudes that get their nails done but can’t even change a tire or change their own oil 
9533 2018-07-30 00:06:10 @bodymerry ordered 2 of your products (Vanilla Orange Stretch Marks and Scars Defense Cream and Stretch Marks & Scars Defense Oil) while I was in Chicago and it worked like magic!!!! Really impressed and would like to know how to become your partner/distributor in Nigeria. 
9534 2018-07-30 00:05:51 E15 is an environmental hoax, and a pork barrel gift for corn farmers. So is E10. They are no longer needed to make the US less oil dependent, they reduce overall fuel efficiency, they generate more atmospheric pollution than they save, and they reduce vehicle engine life.
9535 2018-07-30 00:05:32 School finna start now and I still don’t have a picture of me with oil on my booty at the beach. That was my goal smh
9536 2018-07-30 00:05:32 No the oil that replaces the tankers will go via Sumas. Sumas will also reduce oil-by-rail to the Puget Sound. The Westridge will replace foreign oil and oil-by-rail in California
9537 2018-07-30 00:05:24 Believe it or not vegetable oil does the trick. I have had to do my fair share of restoring scratched wood and all I can say is I got my security deposit back. It helps 
9538 2018-07-30 00:05:23 But illegal immigrants don't pay into system bc they work under the table. But i will definitely agree we should not be paying to subsidize corporations esp oil co and pro sports.
9539 2018-07-30 00:05:22 yeah i hope so. it was 4 feet of sewage and oil inside so the house is just. fucked.
9540 2018-07-30 00:05:20 Try swirling warm salt water around it or/and putting a bit of clove oil on it or on a cotton pad at the painful parts just don’t swallow either especially not the clove rinse well but it helped me majorly through an infected root canal xx
9541 2018-07-30 00:05:03 Coconut oil is fantastic for burns.
9542 2018-07-30 00:04:45 Oleo referring to oil, while saccharum refers to sugar. Oil sugar. The oil contained within the orange peels will be drawn out, and combine with the sugar to bring about a potent mix.

In a way, it’s sort of the non-alcoholic version of bitters?
9543 2018-07-30 00:04:29 Kneeling by importing more oil to the EU and cutting into his profit margin? Making NATO countries pay their share so they are stronger against Russia? Keep up the leftist spin, somebody will buy it.
9544 2018-07-30 00:04:24 Must be the 'Love You Long Time' beard oil.
9545 2018-07-30 00:04:08 Lavendar and peppermint oil rubbed behind both ears.
9546 2018-07-30 00:03:47 Now we know, because of the horizontal fracking revolution, that fossil fuel of oil and gas plus all the coal reserves ensure that these energy supplies are going to last for several hundreds of years.

9550 2018-07-30 00:03:04 Changed my car's oil myself for the first time. I think I'm finally qualified for manhood.
9551 2018-07-30 00:02:50 Hayleigh is heating up olive oil to put in her hair , Scottie asks who said that was a good idea and she says scientist.... Scottie then says “scientist also thought the earth was flat” lol! I don’t want him to go  #BB20

9556 2018-07-30 00:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
9557 2018-07-30 00:02:31 I had to  adjust my diet too.. the supplements barely help, I suggest buying buy the mct oil as well
9558 2018-07-30 00:01:59 The oil tankers sailing out of Westridge to Asia will NOT replace oil tankers sailing to WA refineries. That was in the very first response after you lobbied that the Trans Mountain Pipeline is good for Orca, their habitat and their food habitat. #BlairWhichProject
9559 2018-07-30 00:01:56 "Agreed." She finished off her motor oil. "Thank you for the drink.

9567 2018-07-30 00:00:57 Reminds me of when Boston did Les Mis and the guy came on the field whistling Do You Hear the People Sing. FILLED Lucas Oil, which is pretty damn impressive.

9570 2018-07-30 00:00:34 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.

9573 2018-07-30 00:00:28 Who is we? Mossedegh was nationalizing the oil sales, not retooling the market. And even the US traded with the Soviet Union.
9574 2018-07-30 00:00:13 bones don’t turn to oil
