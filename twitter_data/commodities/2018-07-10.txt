If the U.S.A . is in favor, it must be to benefit the selfish wishes of the the United States of America. 
Please, U.S.A, stay out of their business.
The nations must live out their own sovereignty.
Even if they buy commodities or petrol from Russia or Arab nations.

8 2018-07-10 23:27:12 The capitalist's power -- his command over the labor power of others -- does not reside in a simple accumulation of commodities.   It is a social arrangement that, once capitalism has prevailed, is constantly replenished (like the vampire) by the metaphorical blood of workers.

12 2018-07-10 23:02:13 Oh!  Are you saying that for you, Peter (not Marx) -- capital is more or less == to the commodities used in production (presumably including the production of labor power)?
13 2018-07-10 22:57:13 I know, I'm mostly just teasing.  For the record, while it is true that all *commodities* are the result of prior labor, it is also true (in Marx) that Capital is *not* simply the commodities used in production.

Protecting people from greed shouldn't trap them at the same address because they can't afford to move.

On a larger note there is no good end to allowing basic necessities to become for profit commodities.
18 2018-07-10 22:25:38 We import almost everything and have few commodities for exports . Even with these few exports there is no value added so the cash we are getting to serve as forex buffers is very small ( the bond market is our only alt I think )

45 2018-07-10 22:04:44 Exactly! But that’s what happens when common sense and logic are scarce commodities.

48 2018-07-10 21:57:55 Yes. A federal district court has said that virtual currencies are commodities. It did not say what it considers to be a “virtual currency.” But no, that in particular does not bar a different federal court from finding that xrp is a security.
49 2018-07-10 21:32:09 fico lembrando da época que meu pai comprava e vendia coisas com commodities da roça, tipo carneiro, porco e pele de vaca

ai tem coisa que compro e penso: quantos carneiros será que vale esse celular?
50 2018-07-10 21:27:50 Commodities.  That's all they are to some.
51 2018-07-10 21:15:03 Of course, there exist free exchange of commodities, products, property, between free economic agents. All of this is possible thanks to property rights. A core institution of western civilization that took thousands years to emerge as we know it.

54 2018-07-10 20:58:29 That was a typo. This is what I meant to say:

"Sometimes I work in commodities."

As opposed to:

"I work in commodities."

Sorry about that.
55 2018-07-10 20:46:10 Actually, Bill Clinton re-wrote the Community Reinvestment Act and repealed the Commodities Future Modernization Act, which loosened regulations and that was what started the bubble. Forcing banks to lend to subprime buyers...it just came to a head when housing prices went down.

57 2018-07-10 20:37:02 Because he's nothing to say at all. Except for killings everywhere around the country and sky rocketing prices of basic commodities.
58 2018-07-10 20:34:58 America loot started with the Treated of Indian. Spain live longer wealthy wit South American Gold and commodities, obligated to commerce only with Spain. Same think like the EU. Finally South America had Independence of Spain with England and US support. Same think to learn.

60 2018-07-10 20:30:41 Commonwealth countries provide us with various commodities which sustains our Stock Trade.  Etc etc.  You need to help repair the damage that has offenfed. Before we loose that chunk of resource to Britain's wealth
61 2018-07-10 20:28:17 People that buy physical commodities like gold and silver are the kind of people who would have bunkers to hide from people.

63 2018-07-10 20:21:43 So the World Cup is down to a country that views its Black and Brown citizens as problems if they’re not commodities, a team repeating fascists slogans and the 2nd greatest purveyor of global violence. How lovely.

67 2018-07-10 20:14:48 You apparently do not know how Macro economics work.

How pork and soybean farmers do you know? I sometimes do work in the commodities sector.

Amazing how an automobile factory can just up and move in a matter of weeks! That usually takes a couple years to do.

Astounding.

74 2018-07-10 19:27:33 cheap labour equals more profit not rocket science slavery is still going on but now paid for slavery, people are commodities just like flour the more you have the lower the cost of buying it that is why OPEC limit producing oil to keep prices high
75 2018-07-10 19:26:54 It is useful, and will be more useful when you can buy coffee and not have to put it and other small purchases on your tax return. Also, volatility would be negligible if (when?) bitcoin is priced closer to the value of other commodities. But thanks for playing.

84 2018-07-10 18:40:38 As long as animals are seen as commodities instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable. It’s considered “normal” in the Australian wool industry for approximately 3 million young lambs to die every spring.

114 2018-07-10 16:18:18 The fact that a current SCOTUS judge would do this makes me physically sick. Religious ideology, money, & power are the 3 branches of government. My respect for the highest court in the country is gone. Americans are treated as commodities. @Scotus

117 2018-07-10 16:10:07 Chris is seeing them as expendable commodities too, even more so that Winston because he would keep the numbers. Chris is out to take out that side of the house, period point blank if you aren't his 5 you are nothing to him
118 2018-07-10 16:07:17 Yep

In a long-term range market, the monthly trend is oscillating, and we will need to ignore it; So, only trade off 4H, D, and W.

But, usually, we monitor all major FX pairs, major Indexes & ETFs and some commodities; there have got to be some very trending markets. 
119 2018-07-10 16:07:11 I think it’s worse than that- they care about babies, but more as commodities than people. Pro-life movements always seem to have super-close relationships with adoption. Effectively it’s about forcing women with few choices to be surrogates.
120 2018-07-10 16:03:34 It seems that Government of the day is hell bent to commodify & commercialize #EDUCATION in India! What is the sense of Greenfield & Brownfield? Are we talking about some manufacturing or production units with humans as inputs & commodities as outputs? #InstituteofEminence
121 2018-07-10 16:01:50 Spread it wider? To what? Other agricultural commodities? No thanks.
122 2018-07-10 15:59:52 @StocksNJocks the s&p 500 index has done a 180.  It went from a created numerical hedge for portfolio managers to manage risk such as ag commodities, to an investment for retirements
123 2018-07-10 15:56:50 that's a bigger spread than I would have expected --

was more in the commodities are hard and not ideal to tariff, so end effect would be more modest camp.
124 2018-07-10 15:56:09 Banks, a man who keeps his money in tax havens and gets tips from Russians about buying shares in diamond and gold companies, on a fishing trip to a tax haven with a former metals commodities trader? 
And they claim to despise the ‘elites’? 
Yes, I hope both stay there too.
125 2018-07-10 15:56:02 Africa shd form its own cartel 4 fair price like OPEC for each of its unique commodities n minerals n deal with Western demands accordingly.
126 2018-07-10 15:51:08 our bill for the last three months was unbearable coz we only use household commodities but. The bill is too high.
127 2018-07-10 15:47:30 But saving isn't smart when the world financial currencies flactuate and lose value over time. Investment is key especially in great commodities such as Gold, Silver, Oil and tech companies.
128 2018-07-10 15:46:16 Maybe by simply changing the frame to other commodities you will see it more easily. (2/2)
129 2018-07-10 15:45:50 Well, let’s see now: a)bid ask spreads would eat you alive b)if no bid ask spreads why would endlessly buying & selling generate a gain any more than a loss? c)why wouldn’t this same principle apply to other commodities like, less say, pork bellies or cotton—same principle? (1/2)

131 2018-07-10 15:30:36 Incidentally I'd love to see a chart like that but for embedded emissions in commodities consumed in California but produced elsewhere. I imagine that would shift the balance considerably...
132 2018-07-10 15:27:01 Furthermore, time and labor are not commodities, sorry.  Commodities are things that are produced and sold.  Labor is an input to production, but not a commodity.  If time was a commodity, I'd be happy to buy another four hours for my day!
133 2018-07-10 15:21:23 If the commodities were inspected and found legit why persecute these traders when the real culprits for money laundering are free out there  #StopKPCSideShows
134 2018-07-10 15:10:10 Those, from Islam, who not only justify the rapes of yazidi girl,  but enjoy and trade them as commodities, terms demand of justice as rape justification.
135 2018-07-10 15:08:48 Life and suffering are both commodities that I am eternally positioning myself to sell. Are you in the market? I can cut you a deal.
136 2018-07-10 15:06:26 Thank you. Currently working my 24th year of full tax/NI contributions (+2 not quite full when I was a student!). & yes it shouldn't all be about our 'worth'/'contribution', circumstances change. Before Brexit we were friends/neighbours/colleagues/family. Now? Mere commodities.
137 2018-07-10 15:06:03 What countries ? Economy is only roaring for those who don't work hard for a living. Wages are stagnant. Costs are up, for : gas, prescription drugs, healthcare, local taxes, interest rates, and because of your *tariffs* (actually - taxes) - many other commodities.
138 2018-07-10 14:59:59 The economic crisis is momentary worldwide because the demand for commodities remains high.

Everything is a matter of moment
139 2018-07-10 14:58:25 Why would Two countries with completely different economies (heavily focused on commodity production) in different continents be comparable? It’s not like the UK can just suddenly become a bigger producer of commodities.
140 2018-07-10 14:48:49 Dr.swamy had many a times told that indirect taxes on just 22 commodities and select services alone would fetch 90% of indirect taxes revenue....none listens ...
141 2018-07-10 14:46:17 Players are commodities and should do as they're told.... #sarcasm
142 2018-07-10 14:38:03 Market ready for a crash. near the top. there is usually one last rally in commodities, remember OIL just before the last crash...and growth stocks..FANGS, which have had a huge move. when they peak, it the top.
143 2018-07-10 14:30:51 Absolutely.  commodities are already dropping plus @potus has pissed off citizens of the other nations so they are more likely to boycott US foods.
144 2018-07-10 14:28:09 Not printing money. The Fed has stolen 95% of the value of our dollar. 
Gold or other commodities would be helpful for backing money. 
Also competition.
145 2018-07-10 14:27:45 This is not limited to #crypto, also conventional markets like stocks and commodities are traded by majority of men.

147 2018-07-10 14:05:05 I'm going to find a way to add a commodities market to this game or die trying
148 2018-07-10 14:00:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.

150 2018-07-10 13:58:34 Amore, foram 13 anos de governo, nada mudou o país sucumbiu!

151 2018-07-10 13:57:06 They are known commodities. Need to see what others are

154 2018-07-10 13:31:20 They didn't want to touch Bitcoin either. In fact they should only trade digital commodities and stop touching unlicensed digital securities such as XTZ, XRP, EOS, ZEC. We're currently setting up an inter-blockchain alliance to push for this change.
155 2018-07-10 13:23:29 Rising prices for sugar is great news for Sugarcane farmers. The best way to increase prices is to limit supply. 

The Saudis do it with oil
The Italians do it with Ferraris

Why cant Africa do the same with its raw commodities?

#AfricanUnion #Africa #cobalt #Colton #chocolate
156 2018-07-10 13:15:44 Humbled, good sir. We continue to export raw agro-commodities while the "value-adders" in the west maintain the "origin labelling" (Ethiopia, Kenya etc) for brand value and product authenticity. It is the same old economic injustice playing out.
157 2018-07-10 13:04:26 ..nem eu gosto de advogado, pra ser sincero. A maioria é um bando de asno que se acha autoridade, infelizmente. Mas mesmo não atuando em área criminal, isso aí tudo que tá acontecendo é bem básico. É como te perguntar o conceito, sei lá, de commodities. Qq aluno de adm responde
158 2018-07-10 13:02:05 Gold & silver became used for exchange with debits & credits. As commodities, value was subject to manipulation. Relativity of value a mental environment game. Credit game allowed consumption to be brought forward from the future. Now, future over committed. Econ shrink to fit?
159 2018-07-10 12:55:14 O Brasil tava na onda de commodities na era Lula, tipo de comercio que continua grande até hoje no Brasil, só que a nossa concorrência aumentou, nossa exportação é fraca, não rende muito PIB, não nos industrializados o suficiente e com qualidade, não exportamos tecnologia

164 2018-07-10 12:26:06 A country that fails to ensure that every citizen can access the basic commodities of life should not be referred to as rich. We are struggling really
165 2018-07-10 12:25:15 Go over Ms. Uson's facebook page, you'll see a lot of these cuckoo comments from DDS&W (W - Worshiper) regarding inflation rate. You must be a rich individual - not affected with inflation rate, can easily buy commodities, enjoying your purported economic bloom while relaxing.
166 2018-07-10 12:01:07 Productive is defined as: "producing or able to produce large amounts of goods, crops, or other commodities"  Not sure its the right word for what this Cabinet does. 'Self-interested survival' might be more appropriate.

169 2018-07-10 11:28:41 (this manifests in the fact nobody would have any money from wages to buy any of these commodities. Labor Theory of Value is pretty ingenious & Marx was way ahead of his time. Def ahead of today's mainstream economists at least who are useless.)
170 2018-07-10 11:22:13 Says it all , great trainers love their horses and animals, they don’t just view them as commodities. I think it’s only sickos that want to hurt animals and I don’t think there are any in the industry and if there were they would be caught out pretty quick by any animal lover
171 2018-07-10 11:20:24 If all labor was replaced with automated machines, it wouldn't matter how much more fast, efficient, and productive they are.
The surplus-value in all commodities produced would be 0, as you need labor time time to produce it. No surplus-value, no profit. 
Societal collapse.
172 2018-07-10 11:13:20 yes. the current allocation of commodities also creates the truly immense waste that is currently making our world more and more uninhabitable by the year.
173 2018-07-10 11:10:26 Wrong!!! You should pay more as you are the ones who are destroying countries and arming and funding wahhabism all in the pursuit of commodities. Can't believe you want the rest of the world to pay to clean up your fucking mess you terrorist.
174 2018-07-10 11:10:26 you just admitted that were we to have communism now, no one would starve. it is the allocation of commodities and labour brought about by capitalism that causes starvation in our present world
175 2018-07-10 11:03:41 In a box to box role for Sarri he could thrive, but I’ll reiterate once more I’m not saying let’s sell him, I’m saying let’s sell him if somebody offers a crazy amount of money for a player who doesn’t score or assists goals which are the main commodities in football.
176 2018-07-10 11:02:36 The US can only afford this huge military expenditure because it has the world reserve currency and that currency is required by everybody around the world to buy commodities like oil. This gives the US a huge free lunch.
177 2018-07-10 10:55:00 So What’s your point here? You can’t buy food because? You spend it on an expensive phone? To pay for internet? Or because you want to the movies?
Your question should be: can I enjoy all of capitalism commodities without contributing to such system
178 2018-07-10 10:49:45 Nagbakasyon ka, samakatuwid nagpahinga ka. Hindi mo naranasan ang hirap. At bakit damay si Lapu Lapu dito? Anong katangahan yan. Kaya tumataas ang commodities dahil bagsak ang piso, at reliant tayo sa exports at petroleum (na tumataas dahil sa pagbagsak ng piso).

181 2018-07-10 10:39:06 I think around last year they were fighting for LGBT right. I mean the country is so poor and their best export commodities are women so macam ummm priorities?? Moldovian women are very beautiful.
182 2018-07-10 10:36:29 Nandito ka ba sa Pilipinas para masabi mo na mas maganda ang sitwasyon ngayon? Peso is down, inflation is high. Basic commodities are high. People are still unemployed. Traffic pa rin. May nakawan pa rin, and worse mas laganap ang patayan.
183 2018-07-10 10:30:30 Serious Q: how can you be 'anti-environment'? I get that there are people who put profit before anything else, who see animals as commodities&not living beings, or who are just in denial...but who looks at the the trees&the ocean&actively thinks 'I hate it, let's destroy it'?!
184 2018-07-10 10:07:32 Smaller farms that can't take the hit go bust while maga corporate farms that hedge commodities pick up the land on the cheap from foreclosure. That's what fascism is all about - capture the means of production. Oddly enough prices will eventually go up!

230 2018-07-10 04:25:02 I guess now I have to explain socialism to you but by collectively owning/controlling the main means of production and producing actual necessary commodities, not just profit. It’s realizing that a lot of what we mass produce, we don’t need. And getting rid of class divisions.

We also advocate your second point. Newborns shouldn’t be barred from participating in the free market as consumers, suppliers or commodities, regardless of age. #ableg #MABA
232 2018-07-10 04:23:36 Amen. Humans Beings are not commodities. They are living, breathing spirits with souls & multi-divergent life experiences make no two patients alike. Not algorithms. Corporations denigrate patients, Nurses, & Doctors by forcing ‘factory medicine’ upon them for corporate profit.
233 2018-07-10 04:19:45 Do you know why Buhari was ousted in 1985? Have you read the coup speech that ousted him or seen newspaper extracts within that period? Do you know that Nigerians queued for essential commodities within that two years? A megalomaniac idiagbon was behind the madness!
234 2018-07-10 04:14:01 It costs $233,000 to raise a child in the US.Unwed mothers can’tget out of poverty. Teen pregnancies make special needs kids as often on drugs/alcohol at time of conception. We have 1,000’s of unwanted kids.They live on streets/sex traffic commodities.The humane act is pro choice
235 2018-07-10 03:58:30 Bullshit.  Not only have you NOT improved anyone's life, you've actively made things WORSE.  For everyone but the top 1% and corporations.  Paying more for gas, commodities (because of tariffs), health insurance, and to get even worse.  Taking away health care for kids. LIAR.
236 2018-07-10 03:58:26 We need a commodities board,  until we have one like it used to exist under our regional arrangements,  very few farmers will get the opportunity to scale and actually make worthwhile profit.
237 2018-07-10 03:35:00 Currencies dont. Some projects are more like commodities. Either way once a currency lost the trust of the public it’s game over. Recovering from hyperinflation doesn’t happen

246 2018-07-10 03:03:45 I’m glad you brought this up because I read it down below in the thread. Socialism or communism does not mean taking “hard earned” income/theft.... it means equally distributing resources and necessary commodities so everyone has a chance of survival
247 2018-07-10 03:01:51 Your on the path to chasing loss, eventually if your talking about margin trading cryptocurrency, as opposed to the very high risk traditional commodities.

The fact that you wrote this tells me crypto is really drying up.
248 2018-07-10 02:56:30 If we can survive it... it'll be for the better.

Farmers will have to buckle down this year...it's gonna be rough with commodities where they're at.
249 2018-07-10 02:46:27 so add a third...it's not like the other 2 are pictures of perfect health or proven commodities yet.

256 2018-07-10 02:03:50 Exactly right!  The word "Republican" or "GOP" is a swear word to most conservative libertarians that love Trump.  
Focus on commodities like jobs, economy, etc. To bring in new voters. Not Federal Laws as your reasona!
257 2018-07-10 02:00:23 Keep in mind ... as there are less markets available to sell ones product, the price starts to drop. That’s what you’ll see on the commodities markets here soon enough. Just wait ... big economic implications. You don’t prosper while exiting markets.

Ambos términos en la suma, se corresponden a variables externas al Gobierno de K. No fueron producto de medidas económicas.

262 2018-07-10 01:05:17 1. First, I wouldn't suggest trading Bonds and CL - they are very different types of contracts. Specialise in one. Bonds are arguably the most complex in terms of correlations because they can be influenced by a number of factors eg risk on/off, inflation eg strong commodities
263 2018-07-10 01:05:08 Commodities, for sure, and some services (eg, postal). But there are other social welfare services, like firefighters, police, health care etc that aren’t w/in their purview. There is a world where socialism & capitalism can coexist. See Norway as a great example. It’s a both/and

268 2018-07-10 00:43:00 I'm not judging anyone for their hobby I've sunk tens of thousands of hours into videogames. I dropped out of a scammy for profit design program.

I'm arguing that it's dumb to build an identity around not only a hobby, but around being a consumer of commodities as a hobby
269 2018-07-10 00:41:30 I'm hearing that cotton is likely in Rochester area in the next year or so. 
If the Barmah Choke is bypassed it will be the end of GMID.
Another issue,  why can't dairy compete with other commodities
270 2018-07-10 00:36:38 Who ever wrote this doesn't know very much about commodities. Don't trust journoulists about very complex issues. Chances are they're selling you a product.
271 2018-07-10 00:19:54 It's only truly a choice if it's a fully aware & informed one that hasn't been influenced or affected by limiting patriarchal societal expectations of women. Not a fan in general of occupations that profit off women's looks & treat them like disposable commodities
272 2018-07-10 00:14:58 Gold finally turned around for the July run after finding a low a $1238. Seasonally up from here but China wont be keen for a strong move up currently. Should test $1275.

Mega Deals
Don't confuse MoUs and MoAs, they're two different things.
Examples: Financial and Commodities Ecosystem - $1,5 billion.
Cyprus $4,2 billion - platinum mine & refinery. 7 Mega Deals signed with Belarus. Do tell Cde, when are they coming to fruition?
274 2018-07-10 00:02:09 Corporate started treating employees like commodities. You could tell the crew attitude changed.
275 2018-07-10 00:00:58 I think part of the reason eth and other crypto's are down now is because of volatility in other markets like commodities etc related to trade wars & other factors. Profits to be made elsewhere while infrastructure is buidlt. long term fundamentals are still great.
