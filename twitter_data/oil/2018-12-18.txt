12 2018-12-18 23:58:34 One thing to note on this flat price capitulation is that timespreads havent weakened further. So the armada of ships to store oil situation hasnt happened, and is unlikely given the OPEC cuts start to feed through.
13 2018-12-18 23:58:33 Not to mention, Ontario was a major investor when tar oil needed a bail out. Not only did Ontario directly invest to save it, Ontario also contributed 40% of the federal money Trudeau's dad invested to bail it out.
AB hasn't even come close to returning that investment.

41 2018-12-18 23:57:11 What a great spot for a water bottling facility. Imagine, a facility supplying water to states in the United States and maybe other countries. More valuable than oil and fresh water filtered from Canada.
42 2018-12-18 23:56:50 You're thanking it for what? Sucking off #MBS and crushing the *US* oil industry? How many other industries has it destroyed, besides farming and steel? Thank you very little from Houston, #MAGAt.
43 2018-12-18 23:56:47 As Canadians we need to learn how to build through oil... oil is in everything we do every day... I can’t understand for the life of me why we can’t support both sectors... build pipelines and enjoy the economic benefits of it... well we develop green technology
44 2018-12-18 23:56:47 If the purchase price of an EV is low enough, and the discount for running them compared to gas is high enough - everything changes.

48 2018-12-18 23:56:17 Your 100% right. But I would argue that he got the result that he wanted . An industry so guttednand desperate that it would have no choice but to take the welfare and handouts. To move the industry away from oil and gas. And towards what he calls "diversivication" of investment.
49 2018-12-18 23:56:12 We need to stop extracting oil & gas from the North Sea, but many jobs and mortgages, especially in the North East of Scotland, depend on that continuing. We also depend on the income tax they pay, and the fuel & other products produced.

52 2018-12-18 23:55:34 No doubt, but as a standalone Trump is the most loathsome creature there is. I never understood how he even got a fucking tv show let alone the presidency. And all the asshole enablers should be boiled in oil.
53 2018-12-18 23:55:34 Larry, you say Albertans want government out of their #oilandgas corporations? Great, then give Canada back the over $3B per year subsidy that those oil and gas corporations get from our tax dollars. We’re basically buying your jobs for you. #cdnpoli #ABpoli #YellowVestsCanada
54 2018-12-18 23:55:30 The "need" for WAR is greed. Oil & gas pipelines. Nothing to do w/ freedom. WAR is an Industry that the U.S.economy revolves around.
55 2018-12-18 23:55:19 The US continues to monitor situation at the Sharara oil field and echoes the UN Support Mission for Libya’s call for immediate, unconditional withdrawal of armed elements in the area which is crucial to allow oil production for the benefit of all Libyans to resume -State Dept.

62 2018-12-18 23:54:46 $1.8b in six months doesn't seem to be dropping all that much, with the Saudis killing a journalist and lots of oil available why hasn't our feminist Prime Minister dropped this to zero,  Think of the whales just think of the whales

71 2018-12-18 23:53:45 Stop the drama. Tell the CDC to take it off the list. End of problem. It's not dramatic. It's not politically expedient. It's  just effective. You could pass a law. Remember? When you aren't at the bank, working for big pharma,  the NRA, or big oil, why, you're a congressman.
72 2018-12-18 23:53:37 Rouhollah Khomenie was half Indian his father's surname was Hindi. Also both don't like Pakistan much. 

Not to mention India has found a way to buy oil from Iran for peanuts.
73 2018-12-18 23:53:33 Apparently a 3 hour wait for an oil change really means 6 hours

77 2018-12-18 23:53:09 1) cleanse with Aveeno positively radiant cleanser.

5) ML cosmetics miracle serum
6) rose hip seed oil
7) moisturize with cocoa butter.
VOILA.
78 2018-12-18 23:53:06 Many thanks. Methane is said to have four times the impact of CO2? So it’s better to burn logs and release recently embedded CO2 back into the atmosphere where it came from over last say, 20 years. Different to ancient buried CO2 in oil, gas...
79 2018-12-18 23:52:58 They have a plan.    Pump more oil.

84 2018-12-18 23:52:32 No, that's what you were thinking. One track mind in your posts? I wasn't thinking of Obama at all. Actually, I was thinking about all the people Trump has convinced that his greatness is somehow responsible for gas & oil prices around the world. It's not, but he'll claim it all.

86 2018-12-18 23:52:29 lol, the most stupid and pathetic comparison there is. Yes sewage is bad but it decomposes naturally and doesn't kill everything it touches.
Do oil spills decompose? Do they poison everything, including the drinking water for most of our population, killing everything they touch?
87 2018-12-18 23:52:26 yup,...oil deal in arctic
88 2018-12-18 23:52:25 Ever notice if you are beating your meat ..you have to add more oil b4 you re done.....but you get a little on your hand and you can t get the oil off....

89 2018-12-18 23:52:19 This feels like another deflection with a pinch of "Notley bad" (nvm 44 yrs of PC gov + oil price collapse). 

I'm the citizen trying to decide which party has the best approach. You say you represent the UCP, isn't it kind of your responsibility to present the best ideas?
90 2018-12-18 23:52:15 Finally bought an oil diffuser so my bedroom can now smell like lavender 24/7.
91 2018-12-18 23:52:11 Rosneft oil?
92 2018-12-18 23:52:10 I agree! Its pricey, but I converted(not really, I'm still connected to Entergy just in case) to solar a few years ago. I wish I had done it now though, it's about half the price. But big oil would still survive, just on the uses of petroleum elsewhere, like roads, lubricants,etc
93 2018-12-18 23:52:08 Jamie, as you know I'm in oil & gas biz, but for some reason (diversification?), I've never traded it.  But, I hope you're right on this chart...this latest downdraft feels like it has come for a second time "half-cycle"...in other words, downturns come, but this one too soon.

97 2018-12-18 23:51:56 Any articles about Venezuela that build ideas based on the notion that somehow if Venezuela were right wing their economy wouldn’t have tanked during an oil glut cannot and should not be taken seriously by anybody.

99 2018-12-18 23:51:53 A CIBC oil and gas analyst says the recent deterioration in crude oil prices makes it unlikely that a better offer will emerge to force Husky Energy Inc. to sweeten its hostile takeover bid for an oilsands rival.

106 2018-12-18 23:51:03 Wouldn't doubt that Oil is involved somewhere in this. This revolves around Trump after all - he was always going on about taking the Oil. LOL. And he hates anything to do with non fossil based energy. Promotes for his own greed. Always. Cha-ching $$$.
107 2018-12-18 23:50:59 The best info I could find on the Mirando City school was that it became a dust town after an oil boom ended. Nothing to do with immigrants.
108 2018-12-18 23:50:57 Overnight :
Crude oil settles at $46.43 down -7.3% on the day.
Brent gets hammered too.
The price fell -$3.64 or -7.3% to $46.43.  Lowest close since August 2017. 

Brent crude also tumbled, falling by -$3.35 or -5.62% at $56.26.
109 2018-12-18 23:50:55 His Incel followers got Trump elected and STILL to this day talk about Hillary more than Trump does. They're sexists and trolls. Also they smell like Patchouli oil. And shame. Patchouli oil and shame.

110 2018-12-18 23:50:55 They have no intention of ever building a pipeline. Justin Trudeau is conent to use Saudi oil to run his vehicles and heat his home meanwhile. Killing the Canadian oil industry makes him look better to environmentalists at climate change meetings and the New Zealand PM.
111 2018-12-18 23:50:44 Im a fan of beardbrand’s temple beard oil. Orangey. S’nice.
112 2018-12-18 23:50:44 Erin, currently 37 MT of oil shipped from Vancouver go to a US port on the West Coast while 6 MT go to Asia. Why don't the Americans build a pipeline from Alberta to California?
113 2018-12-18 23:50:42 MSM is relentless in their support for big oil. Panel after panel consist of supporters of pipelines and expanding the industry. Rarely if ever is the anti pipeline movement allowed to contribute to the dialogue.
114 2018-12-18 23:50:34 Are you also supported by the Rockerfellers and the Tides campaigns? Its a pretty good deal for the USA refineries they own to force us to sell our oil at a discount.
115 2018-12-18 23:50:11 @JustinTrudeau @SohiAmarjeet it goes to show how little you and the Feds understand Alberta. The $1.6B is spit in the bucket compared to the amount oil companies usually spend to create jobs.  This gift will accomplish little. Not even a selfy.Need ipipelines
116 2018-12-18 23:50:00 CBD oil? Can't hurt to try....
117 2018-12-18 23:49:58 Isnt oil down, dollar up the usual trade?
118 2018-12-18 23:49:47 Sí. Pero es posible que el shale oil implique que ese pico de oferta sea mayor y vaya a haber mucho petróleo durante más tiempo. (Hablo un poco por hablar, sin nada claro).
119 2018-12-18 23:49:46 Gotta make way for the oil brigade. The oil brigade keeps the silk road maintained..
120 2018-12-18 23:49:40 However, one dollar lower oil price costs the shale industry 4 bn USD. So far the shale industry has lost 120 bn USD in revenue, if prices stay this low.
121 2018-12-18 23:49:40 @ABCWorldNews @DavidMuir The other side to low gas prices is that people are out of work in the oil & gas industry. #happytravels
122 2018-12-18 23:49:32 To be fair it says a lot of investment is in gas and gas is killing coal so that’s a plus. Gas has done a lot of climate work. In terms of oil, electric cars are happening oil prices be damned but a tax on petrol wouldn’t hurt the incentives.

127 2018-12-18 23:49:00 Thats what drives me nuts on this: Clean energy is proving exceptionally cost saving. There are smaller countries that are showing an insane level of self-sufficiency with windfarms and solar power. It would mean the destruction of big oil, but it'd mean so much saved.

132 2018-12-18 23:48:05 Holiday lunch today w oil traders/analysts who are long time friends. Table divided between bears (trade war/recession/contagion will keep financials from going long in 1Q) vs bottom pickers who say bounce to come soon supported by OPEC cuts, returning longs after New Year
133 2018-12-18 23:47:54 The 600,000 barrels of oil that went missing from petrojam went into manufacturing Campari. I’m convinced.
134 2018-12-18 23:47:28 EVA YOU ARE WRONG - ALL WEST NATO COUNTRIES PLUS SAUDYS FRIENDS SUPPORT THAT EVIL. SIRYA IS A TARGET OF INTERESTS , GAS AND OIL. BIG POWERS BATTLE.
135 2018-12-18 23:47:27 レイアウト3ヵ月位やってないからメチャクチャレイアウト描きたいけど、最低でも再来月迄レイアウト無理だ………
136 2018-12-18 23:47:17 No. He's an oil boy. Not WH material.
137 2018-12-18 23:47:09 Drake still wonders why riri dropped him for oil money when he showers once a month
138 2018-12-18 23:47:04 Yup. They're like water and oil. Way too different for that to work. Like way, way different. Nope. Not a good combo.
139 2018-12-18 23:47:01 You know you need oil products to build wind turbines right. I’m not saying we shouldn’t diversify but oil and gas is also the greatest tool to raise people, communities and nations out of poverty.
140 2018-12-18 23:46:59 There is no demand. Asia and especially China, you know, the people who were supposed to buy that oil, are moving as fast as possible away from oil.
China also just bought massive oil reserves. Who do you think their neighbours will buy from?
China is also investing heavily ...
141 2018-12-18 23:46:59 My car been needing that oil change whew I was cutting shit close lol
142 2018-12-18 23:46:58 If I'm grilling it, olive oil, squeezed lemon and my fave spice blend. Also, it's nice to have spice packets that are for italian dressings, those work in a pinch. Homemade teriyaki sauce/marinade is easier than it seems too, serve it over brown rice with broccoli, veggies.
143 2018-12-18 23:46:45 If you pull up 5 min before we close for an oil change, 
144 2018-12-18 23:46:37 What a shame. I lived in Calgary for a while. Sad to see a great Canadian city with a progressive SJW Mayor and hurting from the feds inability/refusal to build the oil and gas industry.
145 2018-12-18 23:46:34 That was my suggested solution. It was rejected. Apparently Swedish anchovies are bigger, and in brine instead of oil.
146 2018-12-18 23:46:32 All the stuff you claim in your original tweet is freeman on the land type pseudo-legal woo. Direct Democracy Ireland or whatever they’re calling themselves now being the main purveyors of this snake oil.
147 2018-12-18 23:46:10 And by the way, the global market for oil and gas is far better than Canada’s domestic market. Due to lack of pipeline capacity to take the product out of Canada.
148 2018-12-18 23:46:08 Vacuous, by Melanie. An exotic blend of silicone oil, musk, and decay.
149 2018-12-18 23:46:08 My personal and my provinces bank account is more important than the welfare province that is Quebec. Keep importing foreign oil and remaining a have not province.
150 2018-12-18 23:46:05 See data analytics, also industry consolidation. In fact, I think the freak out in the non-integrated AB oil sector was fuelled by concerns about consolidation opportunities for the integrated producers.
151 2018-12-18 23:45:52 2/2 ...where we’re all so different, it’s hard to say what might work (if at all) for you. And #oil was a preference for me, but of course everyone has their own preference with delivery as well. Good luck with whatever you decide!
152 2018-12-18 23:45:32 I pledge to cook healthy meals for myself and my family with Mamador cooking oil and stay fit everyday,everytime so help me God Amen.

156 2018-12-18 23:45:26 sis im talking about items like my glasses or face oil......
157 2018-12-18 23:45:18 I've grown tired of bringing the price discrepancies to public notice, my platform is too small, it's been like this since the 70's when fuel was 35p a gallon and oil was a similar price to now
158 2018-12-18 23:45:18 まだ届いてないけど、ジョッキで飲んでアニメ観てニヤニヤする自分が想像できるw
159 2018-12-18 23:45:18 Can you travel to Abu Dahbi with CBD oil ?
160 2018-12-18 23:45:16 I got a brand new bottle of argan oil and my man got some brand new sweatpants.. just guess how this story ends, im the literal holder of this L until further notice goodbye

*Not sure about you, but I miss when you just cared about oil, gas & tires.
165 2018-12-18 23:44:58 too bad neither as proposed were seen to be safe and big oil wasn't really interested in safe.
166 2018-12-18 23:44:52 Don't forget, for a limited time when you buy 3 bottles of our 1000 mg 1 oz #CBD oil get $10 off your purchase!
167 2018-12-18 23:44:52 This is true because Gavin doesn’t blot oil off of pizza he blots it off of himself
168 2018-12-18 23:44:49 More financial loan programs from the Feds to a province that wants jobs not handouts further creating dependency not a independence. PMJT just doesn’t understand the root cause in oil and gas industry where the problem of selling low and buying high is creating a crisis.
169 2018-12-18 23:44:36 The reason I say this is Trudeau seems to understand CPC and many provincial cons are coordinating their attack on our institutions. Treaties being one. It centres around oil & resources. Cons have demanded often for Trudeau to override FN Treaty obligations of fed govt.
170 2018-12-18 23:44:36 انا ببيروت
171 2018-12-18 23:44:36 Well, to be fair that pipeline is conveying oil as we speak and returning some $200 million a year in revenues to Canadian taxpayers. Twinning will make it even more profitable. So there is that.
172 2018-12-18 23:44:34 Yup. They are so different, like water and oil. Nope. Wouldn't sound good at all. They too different.
173 2018-12-18 23:44:12 oil hits a low and crypto is in the green. you still think institutional money isn’t flowing in?
174 2018-12-18 23:44:07 More wasted money with 0.0 barrel of oil sold, but the gang of Trudeau & Co doesn't care, just borrow more $$ and make bigger deficit as long as it lasts, that's the legacy for our kids Catherine B!!
175 2018-12-18 23:44:02 Q193: From which you might get oil in USA - area that's near Mississippi (9)
176 2018-12-18 23:44:01 CBD oil is a popular choice amongst athletes. The oil tinctures offer an ease of use, but also a fast onset when it comes to post workout recovery. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol #Organic #cbdextract #cbdheals #CBDlife #hemp #hempoil #highperformance #recovery
177 2018-12-18 23:44:01 2.  Incidentally, Jimmy Carter's energy plan called for 20% of our energy
from renewables by the year 2000 & 
90% of our homes insulated to higher standards by 1985.
That was in the late 1970s,
for "energy independence"
not climate change 
(though oil companies already knew).
178 2018-12-18 23:43:56 I’m breaking out & I don’t know where’s my tea tree oil ... Fuckk
179 2018-12-18 23:43:50 Neilbon: what's my direction for Kamski

David: uhhh just Gavin but if he was the kind of person who blotted the oil off of pizza before he ate it

Neilbon: say no more
180 2018-12-18 23:43:44 Throw a bucket of coconut oil on her face
181 2018-12-18 23:43:42 Palm oil is linked to major issues such as #deforestation #habitat degradation, #ClimateChange, #AnimalCruelty and indigenous #rights abuses in the countries where it is produced, as the land & forests must be cleared for more oil palm plantations.
It's a crisis. That matters. JS
182 2018-12-18 23:43:20 shout out to my car for using oil that takes 3 auto parts stores to find
183 2018-12-18 23:43:16 for some reason I feel like when you apply oil over the moisturizer instead of before it may clog pores, is that false?

186 2018-12-18 23:43:09 After all is said and done, you deserve one of those $20,000 Trump paintings as a just reward for all of your hard work.

What would you do with it if they gave you a snazzy Trump oil painting?
187 2018-12-18 23:43:02 My next car will be a little rinky dink car that gets from point A to point B cause paying for oil changes, gas, new tires, windshields, and everything else aint no joke
188 2018-12-18 23:42:47 L-theanine, exercise, and cbd oil defs saved me though
189 2018-12-18 23:42:35 This offer of "help" by offering us loans of our own tax money is cynical beyond belief. It is simply the beginning of a carefully crafted plan to phase out the western oil industry by trying to ease the pain. This offer is nothing but a sop. It is an insult to Albertans.
190 2018-12-18 23:42:31 i feel so bad abt those oil paints tho my mom got me a rlly expensive set and a scaffold for my graduation and i have used them like once and only bc she forced me to

197 2018-12-18 23:41:41 The one that’s best for really sensitive and dry skin that won’t make me itch. (I use rosehip oil like it’s going out of style and it’s affordable for me.)

200 2018-12-18 23:41:17 I stand corrected, I have now heard him say something anti-war. Aaand I looked up his record, turns out he doesn’t put his money where his mouth is...just like the rest. He’s seems to be a huge fan of our bloated military budget and is quite cozy with oil and gas.
201 2018-12-18 23:41:05 Would have been comfortable totally at Ibrox post 2012 with the other snake oil salesmen that were kicking about at the time.
202 2018-12-18 23:41:05 Oatmeal is a SUPER HEALTH FOOD. Kinda works like magic. You can gain weight while eating healthy. It’s weird. Dress it up with some EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL. OMEGA’s. #AlphaOmegas
203 2018-12-18 23:41:03 If your government really wants to help, build the damn pipeline!! You will never get too many Alberta votes during the election unless you help them move their oil!!
204 2018-12-18 23:41:02 Palm oil
205 2018-12-18 23:40:47 My  on SA, Qatar, possibly Russia - there’s an oil component.  Putin is another arm of this.  There are so many threads it’s been years in the setting up.
206 2018-12-18 23:40:42 This is not campaign donations during the election. This is OIL & COAL LOBBYISTS WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE. Geez, you Beto supporters are worse than Trump supporters when it comes to facts!
207 2018-12-18 23:40:40 and the PC did nothing for 44 years other than golf course & back door deals with their bodies & blowing the oil $ when they were still rolling in bid time
208 2018-12-18 23:40:36 Not yet. But, it's only a matter of time. Norway dependence on oil exports is risky and can cause need to nationalize or sell oil properties, which cause loss of capital and jobs a complete socialist welfare state, like happened to Venezuela. Happy now, starving later.
209 2018-12-18 23:40:34 Be careful sheep he will buy a oil painting of himself again with your hard earned money ! You can’t make this shit up !

217 2018-12-18 23:40:09 Yep. And others think it has to do with Qatar Sovereign Wealth Fund which owns part of Rosneft Oil.
218 2018-12-18 23:40:05 Thanks Johnny.  I bought NUGT today.  I’m prob late as usual  but I think the move in 2016 can be repeated here.  

What about CRC?  The balance sheet is pretty bad but if oil rallies it could be high risk/reward
219 2018-12-18 23:40:00 Once you've got a credible plan to limit your C emissions - accounting for  expansion of oil sand operations - then we'll back you up. Right now, it looks like rickety (and reversible) hand-waving, notwithstanding what your Premier says.
220 2018-12-18 23:39:57 Poor, bumbling mayors of @GoWhistler &  @CityOfVictoria - being tricked by Enviro-lawyers! Paris Climate Action Plan targets #masstourism so once oil companies are cornered, tourism resorts will be next! @Total @CNRL_Oilsands @cityofkelowna #bcpoli
221 2018-12-18 23:39:57 Fair enough. Sorry, went to get two tires replaced and an oil change.. ended up only being the half of it. Just bored haha.
222 2018-12-18 23:39:57 Yes, Armand, apparently the crude bunker oil freighters burn is the worst of the worst. My piece on Saturday will, however, mostly be focussing on the lives of seafarers themselves. Met some!
223 2018-12-18 23:39:57 How ‘bout a trumportrait BONFIRE!!!!  Two oil paintings make for a REALLY GOOD FIRE!  Please somebody...buy them and SET THEM ON FIRE!  Bring marshmallows!
224 2018-12-18 23:39:56 jquip you are a clueless fool. Oil contributes nothing federally and is nothing but a drain on taxpayers.
If we spent the money we waste on oil on industries with a future we would have no problem meeting all of our needs.
225 2018-12-18 23:39:51 Plus do you think that land is adequately taxed? We as a society has moved on a long way from that. Pillaging of oil from beneath the sea for example. And I want to throw in an earlier point about the political power of MNC’s which means they can gain favourable tax laws (google)
226 2018-12-18 23:39:40 No David. It's a Russian plot to divide the democrats with ridiculous purity tests like clean water and opposing oil and gas.
227 2018-12-18 23:39:29 No we don’t hate oil and prosperity Mr Larry. Until humans find a replacement it’s in all our plastics etc., but it is causing problems. It takes hundreds of years for some plastics to break down. But I’m sure u know that. No one hates Alberta either. Let’s just be Canadian.
228 2018-12-18 23:39:23 Access Industries linked to Rusal (Russian oil) and Oleg Deripaska.
229 2018-12-18 23:39:19 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
230 2018-12-18 23:39:14 yeah so if we could all stop bailing out the oil industry and let it fucking die so that renewable energy can take its place that'd be great.
231 2018-12-18 23:39:09 If you grow it yourself and learn how to make oil it is almost for free! ;-)

235 2018-12-18 23:38:50 I have a list, dates from childhood when we had to be wary of race riots. Basically oil, rice, canned food, pasta, couscous, kids’ meds.
236 2018-12-18 23:38:44 If u saw the other Tweet, about the dog that his back legs are not working, this Tweet was about giving him oil to keep him "Kicking"
237 2018-12-18 23:38:44 They mostly use heating oil. Only gas in Belfast and Dublin really

239 2018-12-18 23:38:41 On my way home from my work Christmas party at @MontysDeli. Shoutout to my colleague who didn’t understand Secret Santa and went 600% over budget on a bottle of olive oil for me.

242 2018-12-18 23:38:20 Adulting got me asking my dad for an oil change for a Christmas.
243 2018-12-18 23:38:20 โดนใจจังเลยค่ะประโยคนี้ 
244 2018-12-18 23:38:16 Exactly. And Jason Kenney's ongoing playing up of Canada's oil and gas sector completely ignores the #climate reality we face. We need a #JustTransition for workers, but burying our heads in the sand (tar sands?) on climate change serves no one's best interests.
245 2018-12-18 23:38:09 Thanks big man. You filled with oil yet for Christmas? I could come and get you hot on Friday.

248 2018-12-18 23:37:58 The far infrared Biomat is the most valuable aid my adult daughters with neurolyme use to manage their pain. It is light years from just a heating pad. CBD, pain oil blend, and energy medicine are also supportive. But oh that Biomat!!

253 2018-12-18 23:37:26 I like the guesses on Cambridge Analytica and the banks... my money is on Access Industries, which is the group joined with Russian oil company Rusal/Oleg Deripaska, and was part of the inauguration guests.
254 2018-12-18 23:37:18 "Enhanced vocal clarity." Groan! Pure snake oil BS.
255 2018-12-18 23:37:12 Me: *uses a single drop of wintergreen essential oil*

257 2018-12-18 23:37:10 Are all the oil companies that fund oil industry lobbyist groups and political PACs such as yours all Canadian? No. They aren’t. @Alberta_UCP and @jkenney are the ones raking in the foreign funding. #ableg #cdnpoli #yyc #yeg #medhat #reddeer #Lethbridge

259 2018-12-18 23:36:58 Ghee is clarified butter, used a lot in Indian cooking! Congrats on your reversal! That’s amazing news! I’ve never cooked with grape seed oil; i have some i put on my body tho  does it have much of a flavor?
260 2018-12-18 23:36:46 ですです
261 2018-12-18 23:36:42 Thank you so much for sharing about this amazing oil! 
262 2018-12-18 23:36:23 Someone was clearly long too much #oil and decided to share it with the rest of the market
263 2018-12-18 23:36:20 Half way done with my trials. Focusing on electric water currents to move the oil to the skimmer for collection. DG
264 2018-12-18 23:36:14 Clair Ridge oil platform something like 50,000 tonnes of CO2 every single day and 640 million barrels of recoverable oil for the duration of its life, equal to a quarter of a billion tonnes [of CO2 pollution]? Then how much methane from fracking ? Hows the UK leading the world?
265 2018-12-18 23:36:14 Totally agree, have already stocked up pantry and freezer and heating oil
266 2018-12-18 23:36:12 *In Bath and Body Works* 

Some guy: "She really likes antique car shows smelling like the 30s"

Worker: "I'm sorry sir we don't sell a motor oil scent here"
267 2018-12-18 23:36:01 There are so many, like those with argan oil, Dove has a brand so does CREW or other major brands :)
268 2018-12-18 23:35:45 Tried CBD oil..for some it works for me not so much-
269 2018-12-18 23:35:45 @AndrewScheer - great you are all upset about illegal migrants - but my friends and I are much more interest in where you stand on new pipelines for Western oil?
270 2018-12-18 23:35:44 @WhiteHouse When Oil Prices Are High. It Means The Global Economies Are Super Hot. Hot Demand For Oil.
271 2018-12-18 23:35:44 He took money from execs at oil companies and his policies align with this #dirty $$$
272 2018-12-18 23:35:40 by that do you mean IBS? I've read that it short term messes with IBS, but long term helps it. 

Mayo (when made without soybean oil) is actually pretty good for you. so long as its not combined with refined carbs. (spread on bread).
273 2018-12-18 23:35:30 I mean that forgotten 21 trillion will probably help them steal some oil from the middle East and sell it to Canada to balance the budget...
274 2018-12-18 23:35:16 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
275 2018-12-18 23:35:15 It is not a support package.  It is loans for oil companies.  Getting more into debt when you cannot sell your product is stupid. It will not help anyone in northern Alberta.  Knowing the Liberals, we would probably have to say that we support abortion to qualify for the loan.
276 2018-12-18 23:35:09 Ok, but your advocating authoritarianism then? I'm all for regulations, I really am, but how do you shut down oil companies? How do you reduce carbon emissions when so few people can afford to buy electric vehicles? How do you do this immediately like everyone wants?
277 2018-12-18 23:35:08 He removed his silly tweet about trying to cut off BC from Alberta oil.
278 2018-12-18 23:35:06 僕は全セクションデジタルするならしょうがないといって付き合うが、デジタルはレイアウト若しくは演出までだと思ってる

それ以降まですると現状デメリットの方が大きい気がする
279 2018-12-18 23:35:00 I only use Tom Ford conditioning beard oil, tobacco & vanille or oud wood 
280 2018-12-18 23:34:50 Oil painting.
281 2018-12-18 23:34:45 Cbd oil
282 2018-12-18 23:34:45 Maybe remind him that his generation was the one that fucked up the air and water and decided to make everything out of plastic (oil)...
283 2018-12-18 23:34:38 That's coconut oil you using bro
284 2018-12-18 23:34:23 UN is hijacked by the Arab oil, and is not "international law" anyway.

What year Arab "Palestine" was established and when was it occupied from the Arab "Palestine" lol.
285 2018-12-18 23:34:02 This charade is intended for consumption in other parts of CAN to show that JT is taking the AB oil crisis seriously and is taking action to address it, as would be expected of a leader. These loans do very little for Alberta! All show, no substance!
286 2018-12-18 23:33:59 Well, we do have a trust fund but the ABPCs gave flat-taxes and no PST and used the Heritage Trust Fund to prop up spending. No deposits to the HTF since the late 1980s even when oil was $100/bbl.
287 2018-12-18 23:33:40 @LamboJohnny hi Johnny - love your tweets.  Do you think gold goes higher?  What about $crc for oil?
288 2018-12-18 23:33:36 mm..
oil companies..¡¿.
289 2018-12-18 23:33:35 はーいそうしてください。
ゆっくり休んでくださいね。
お大事に...
290 2018-12-18 23:33:34 I read the freaking thing wrong and clicked the wrong one 
291 2018-12-18 23:33:30 So, I'm  experimenting a bit -- I just sent for some raw coconut oil, raw cocoa butter, raw shea butter, grapeseed oil, and castor oil--and add in some olive oil to create my own blend for my skin and hair.  Enough with the dry skin and scalp!
292 2018-12-18 23:33:27 :-) There's quite a trade in oil, worldwide. Are you planning to use the West Edmonton Mall navy to mount a blockade?
293 2018-12-18 23:33:26 In your opinion is there enough money to be made in conventional oil to build a new grass roots refinery in Alberta?  We are tired of being held captive to US interests because we can't get our dilbit to tidewater.
294 2018-12-18 23:33:19 This is my older brother's family in a nutshell. Moved to Alberta during oil boom (with not even a high school diploma), blew all his money on crap and didn't save...now him and his wife blame Trudeau even though they lost their high paying jobs during Harper era. So frustrating.
295 2018-12-18 23:33:15 Anne, how about we annex Afghanistan and make it a penal colony. Worked pretty well for the Brits with Australia. Next either we annex Venezuela or give it back to Spain since it's a failed country and they can't govern themselves. I'm sure Spain would like the oil reserves.
296 2018-12-18 23:33:13 Yes Notley is full of it when she says she fights for the oil worker, make Alberta great again!
297 2018-12-18 23:33:13 I've done no booze, no caffeine (and never after 9 a.m.), no stimulants, can't take NyQuill, super low resting heart rate + low BP. Been on multiple 48 hr holters, loop-recorders - looking for a snake oil salesman cause I'd buy!! lol
298 2018-12-18 23:33:08 growing disenchanted with kim kardashian and her band of snake oil peddlers
299 2018-12-18 23:33:07 I made shrimp tempura for Will and my Fry Daddy sprayed oil everywhere and now I need to move. If anyone wants a really cute house with a very slippery kitchen, just let me know.
300 2018-12-18 23:33:07 An ELECTRIC saw. Man, MAN UP and get a gas powered one; you gotta premix that oil and gas to make that little 2 stroke engine ROAR and wake up yo neighbors!
301 2018-12-18 23:32:59 Let's get anointed...anointed togetherrrrrr...I'll praise your body, you'll praise mine, yeah...rub me dowwwnnnnn in that holy ghost oil, girl....and I'll do the same things to you...
302 2018-12-18 23:32:59 ภาษารูรู้จังป่ะคะ
303 2018-12-18 23:32:56 Oh please give it a rest. People aren’t as gullible as you think they are. We’ve had 2.5 years to research this ourselves, we know what sort of a disaster a no deal Brexit will be. Stop selling snake oil a put what’s best for the country first
304 2018-12-18 23:32:47 Not trying to have rational discussions with people intent on using only anecdotal experiences, fear-mongering, and blistering hatred is my goal for 2019. If I can do that I may be able to spend less on CBD oil lol
305 2018-12-18 23:32:36 Look like man is intent on destroying the planet we live on.for oil industry profits
306 2018-12-18 23:32:29 Yes the Common Agricultural policy included some absurd reactionary measures eg millions of Sq miles of oil seed rape, slaughtering half our dairy herds etc BUT at the time it was a necessary political weapon against the aggressive US seeking to destroy our international trade
307 2018-12-18 23:32:12 My man just taught me how to change the oil for my truck. 
308 2018-12-18 23:32:12 @naijagym have you tasted warm oil? It's delicious
309 2018-12-18 23:32:05 @CadburyUK I love you guys so much! Do you have any products that do not contain palm oil??
310 2018-12-18 23:32:04 So, Trump threatens illegal invasion. All this because Venezuela has the one of largest—if not, the largest—proven oil reserves in the world. Fix your government.
311 2018-12-18 23:32:04 ねこ！！！！ねこが足りない！！！！ね
312 2018-12-18 23:32:03 everytime i cook instead of eating frozen shit or a sandhwich i think “wow!! Feels so healthy!!!” But then i realize i cooked it in hella oil like damn i cant win
313 2018-12-18 23:31:56 @WhiteHouse Donald. Oil Prices Are Decreasing. Oil Consumption Is Decreasing. This Means. The Global Economies. Are Putting On The Brakes.
314 2018-12-18 23:31:54 The TPP nixing is good. I'd also say the economic revival and slashing taxes for the middle class has been his best domestic policy move so far. Keeping out of war is his best foreign policy move. Getting out of the oil moneymaking in the Middle East is critical.
315 2018-12-18 23:31:50 Great article. My story is similar, left climate science (PhD, Met Office Hadley Center) to buy land, self-build zero-carbon house, grow food, dramatically cut carbon but perhaps, above all buy the time/space needed to deal with climate change & peak oil.
316 2018-12-18 23:31:33 What a feeble attempt by Feds to appease oil & gas sector. Build pipelines etc and dump C69
317 2018-12-18 23:31:30 Today I was misunderstood because I pronounced “Oil” correctly instead of saying “Ole”. 

I just don’t understand the South.
318 2018-12-18 23:31:29 Is the thin ones. Don't soak them first. Pour mix over them in lined tray. Brush both sides w oil to prevent sticking. Cover & cook for first 15 min on low to allow liquid to be absorbed & egg to cook. Remove cover, add cheese return to oven set on broil til brown. Delicious!! 
319 2018-12-18 23:30:54 The last line of the original tweet lol. It won’t absorb over an oil. Do you have any specific questions about it if that’s not clear enough?
320 2018-12-18 23:30:51 I’m sorry to hear that. I have heard wonderful things about CBD oil. I hope you find something legal and useful.
321 2018-12-18 23:30:35 Finally got my essential oil diffuser up and running again  favorite scent lemongrass is in there helping me fight stress and anxiety. I’ve forgotten how much essential oils have helped me stay on track with meditation and yoga. Working on a happier me.

323 2018-12-18 23:30:29 Yes. I am pretty sure those oil companies employees gave him thousands because he is a real progressive and he will end the destructive business model that allow those exact employees to make such large donations.
324 2018-12-18 23:30:27 おいるさん、ありがとうございます
病院行ってしっかり治そうと思います
325 2018-12-18 23:30:26 I don't think the Oil would deal Nurse, cuz tuffness.
326 2018-12-18 23:30:21 there's oil
327 2018-12-18 23:30:11 Klonking did my today salad with Vignette salt and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and potato stuff + Cake...good food~
328 2018-12-18 23:30:02 A Russian or Saudi oil company?
329 2018-12-18 23:29:53 Burning the midnight oil!
330 2018-12-18 23:29:38 One of the best things that I have used is calamine lotion, it's used for bug bites but if you put this on your skin before you go to sleep and leave it on all night, it will stop your skin from getting oily when you sleep because the formula is chalky so it clears up oil
331 2018-12-18 23:29:26 lam ko na yung feeling pag nilagay yung efficascent oil sa mata
332 2018-12-18 23:29:16 Whoever lived in my apt before me ordered a bunch of olive oil straight from Italy, so now guess who never has to buy that high ass shid again 
333 2018-12-18 23:29:14 But in saying that can only imagine it wouldnt be better under Clinton for oil and gas workers - maybe @officialmcafee will get up next - maybe its a big plan to F the Russians and Saudis ...
334 2018-12-18 23:29:03 Almond oil works wonder for eyebrows growth, also for oil cleansing on skin
335 2018-12-18 23:29:01 my ferret knocked over my bottle of peanut oil and had a hell of a time licking it up off the floor
336 2018-12-18 23:28:56 Notebooks. Starbucks gift cards. An essential oil diffuser. Pretty pens. Blankets. A laptop carrying bag thing. Coffee.
337 2018-12-18 23:28:49 Prunes. Lots and lots of prunes. In the old days, they used castor oil. Gag.
338 2018-12-18 23:28:40 Flood Europe with our oil and they are done inside a decade
339 2018-12-18 23:28:40 Coconut oil. Plain and simple. Slippery is as slippery does.
340 2018-12-18 23:28:33 I need to huff some Vicks or some Olbas Oil or something
341 2018-12-18 23:28:32 Mitch McConnell Calls to Cut Social Security, Medicare: A BETTER IDEA ! LET'S MAKE SOME KENTUCKIAN A HERO AND "CUT" THIS "KOCH"-SUKKAS THROAT INSTEAD !! HOW ABOUT PAYIN' BACK THE 1.4 TRILLION DA REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS STOLE FROM OUR SOCIAL SECURITY !!!
342 2018-12-18 23:28:30 I was using lavender oil which was nice but that salve you recommended is heaven...
343 2018-12-18 23:28:27 Annoyed that the workers will be getting the money and not your oil backers Andy?
344 2018-12-18 23:28:26 The oil industry in AB has been a boom and bust business since 1947. It's time to realise that Carbon based industry is obsolete. We may need to tie AB over its hump but the time has come to just leave the oil in the ground and do something else.
345 2018-12-18 23:28:25 My phone autocorrects “CBD oil” to “cod oil”, which seems fitting.
346 2018-12-18 23:28:23 Boiling oil from the roof should do the trick!! Or a moat
347 2018-12-18 23:28:10 Trudeau rescuing the  oil and gas with his 1.6 . Sorry the guy makes my blood boil !!  All good.
348 2018-12-18 23:28:04 And you need someone to buy the oil. The world is slowly banning fosil fuels, most 1st world countries have a plan for it but Canada doesn’t.
349 2018-12-18 23:27:56 Doing a masters project on the impact of the serge of people caring about palm oil consumption, if anyone has any links, books or anything on the matter please message me, thanks x
350 2018-12-18 23:27:52 Yeah, he sold snake oil to so many!
351 2018-12-18 23:27:49 The way your car drives when you first get an oil change and tire rotation>>>>
352 2018-12-18 23:27:45 俺のピュアな心どこいったww
353 2018-12-18 23:27:42 Yes, I know! And I actually have combination skin. I use their hyaluronic acid in the morning and rose hip seed oil in the evening. I've been seeing such amazing results from what I've been using (I have like 8 of their products now, two of them I haven't used yet though).
354 2018-12-18 23:27:40 Love the popcorn made with coconut oil
355 2018-12-18 23:27:37 Here is my first poll. If you dig female wrestling like I do, which do you like better? Female mud, oil or jello wrestling? #mudwrestling #oilwrestlibng #jellowrestling #poll
356 2018-12-18 23:27:36 checked my cars oil quick as fuck and i got oil on my lil uzi shirt :(
357 2018-12-18 23:27:22 Exactly the same way, corrupting politicians with Oil money and promises of it. Solved.
358 2018-12-18 23:26:58 Wild grow oil
359 2018-12-18 23:26:54 Definitely a different way to look at things but the fact is; corn is turned into food; even distillers grains from ethanol are fed to livestock(beef,pork, turkey, chicken).  Majority of soybeans are used for food as well.  Tofu is one example and soybean oil is used mayo
360 2018-12-18 23:26:42 Alternative low dose methods would be a significant harm reduction but extracting oil is manufacture of class B penalized by up to 14 year jail term.
361 2018-12-18 23:26:37 泣いた
362 2018-12-18 23:26:34 いい天気や…おぱよー！
363 2018-12-18 23:26:33 I think oil and gas company 
364 2018-12-18 23:26:30 Someone just witnessed me licking olive oil from my pesto pizza off my arm, starting at the elbow and going up to my pinky finger. Zero shame.

369 2018-12-18 23:26:10 #quebec has decided not to frac in their province and develop their oil and gas prospects. Why do the work when the people of Alberta will and just send us money.
370 2018-12-18 23:25:58 Tucker told Ben Shapiro he agrees w/ Bernie on many issues. He's socialist/AntiWar But Leftists hate Tucker more than NeoCons WarMongers,/Oil Tycoons/Ben Shapiro,L.Graham. Because Tucker refuses to play the 'Hate Whitey game' & that's the only unforgiveable sin for Leftists
371 2018-12-18 23:25:53 What did Sir David Attenborough say at the @UN #ClimateChange Conference #COP24 ?  #TakeYourSeat Whilst UK and @claireperrymp remain in global denial opening new oil and gas wells saying green is great. Who do you believe Claire or David?
372 2018-12-18 23:25:48 But because Albertans don’t want to deal with the fact that oil is the past, its costing us, tax payers 1.6B and way more over the years because politicians such as yourself don’t take the right measures because of votes.
373 2018-12-18 23:25:43 lagi perlu l'oreal extraordinary oil karena rambut keringgg parahhhh. wish me luck
374 2018-12-18 23:25:22 This young woman has more ethics than all the Liberal MPs from rural ridings where oil, mining, and other construction projects are ongoing and planned.  Where are their resignations? #cdnpoli @CPC_HQ
375 2018-12-18 23:25:16 We don't want the "aid" nor asked for it, we want the pipelines approved and stop being held hostage by 2 provinces which already import oil from overseas. And your #climatechange bs will never work. No developed country will meet the goal by the deadline it's already been shown
376 2018-12-18 23:25:11 Sk@nk Oil.
377 2018-12-18 23:25:09 Considering how oil and water the raw and smackdown commentary was, these two were underrated. I feel on smackdown they were just in the background and never took away from the matches
378 2018-12-18 23:25:06 I know My skin feels like silk after I'm done with it.  I use coconut oil after the shower every day.. especially in the winter. I have a sugar scrub too and it smells and feels delicious on my skin 
379 2018-12-18 23:25:02 His record and campaign contributors are concerning. I don't support wall street, oil, and healthcare industries  being allowed to run amok. No thanks. It'll be #Bernie2020, or Green party for me again.
380 2018-12-18 23:25:01 My guess is Russias government owned oil giant, Rosneft.
381 2018-12-18 23:24:58 I got my oil changed and I noticed that the Jiffy Lube stickers no longer have the flag on them. I wonder why they took it off.
382 2018-12-18 23:24:56 God I fucking hate essential oil shillers
383 2018-12-18 23:24:56 so the key was stuck in the schlage door lock thingy and the deadbolt was also stuck out so i couldnt close the door nor take the key out so with a little cannola oil and a screw driver i fucking fixed it & i wanted to share this cuz im proud of myself ksksdjd
384 2018-12-18 23:24:52 Hot bubble baths w/ baby oil >
385 2018-12-18 23:24:51 No rights are being trampled on except Albertans trying to get oil to markets.  Everyone else is given more rights.  You should do your homework!

388 2018-12-18 23:24:18 *U.S. SAYS MONITORING SHARARA OIL FIELD SITUATION #oott
389 2018-12-18 23:24:17 Brent, you really aren't thinking things through. If QC were to drill for oil and gas on Anticosti Island, then why would QC be a major market for AB oil and gas? So, the equalization "fix" would kill a market for AB oil and gas, which QC now accesses via the Line 9B reversal...
390 2018-12-18 23:24:15 Same with sesame oil. It's amazing and only used in small quantities... The omega 6 hate is getting a little out of hand IMO.
391 2018-12-18 23:24:11 13 billion in oil* money is all that stays in Canada so by contrast it’s profound
392 2018-12-18 23:24:09 Sick how they worry about the slim possibility for an oil spill but not about the people being oppressed in the countries oil is imported from. Hypocrites. Gutless wonders. Snowflakes. Oh but it’s only 7% imported. My oh my! Go live in one of those exporting countries then opine.
393 2018-12-18 23:24:01 “What happened to the whole for filling your true destiny and avenging your family name bullshit ?”

394 2018-12-18 23:23:59 I am on Prozac now and have been for about 2 years, but I am trying to use other methods such as CBD oil, weighted blankets, meditation. the meds have gotten me through the hardest times in my life, but I am feeling almost ready to stop them but also scared
395 2018-12-18 23:23:55 Palm oil from Africa are way more better compared to the ones in the shops over here
396 2018-12-18 23:23:54 The kitchen paper supermarket has fabulous grana padano. The toilet Rolls one has fantastic balsamic vinegar. Together they should Be good  i mixed the vinegar with fresh olive oil to dip artichokes in it  too good 
397 2018-12-18 23:23:51 There is cbd oil made for just pets
398 2018-12-18 23:23:48 Sure it is ... all oil.  Are you funded by Tides US or something?
399 2018-12-18 23:23:39 Check the stock market or if you like the oil market.
400 2018-12-18 23:23:09 I feel that. I take evening primrose oil to help with the breakouts and mood swings. And I went keto to try to combat it and it helped tremendously. Sugar is the enemy!
401 2018-12-18 23:23:07 Don't agree with you on this one Greg. Sometimes you gotta take what you can get & not what you want. Reality is the world is moving away from oil. Diversify has always been the key to Alberta's economy & even Peter Loughheed said that.
402 2018-12-18 23:22:51 I will be putting some $ into the oil sector.  Although the turnaround will take some time.  Dark skies in Calgary for sure.
403 2018-12-18 23:22:51 I have had enough of Khanyos attitude, it reflects badly on the church body, also what kind of brother turns his big sister away I'm sure they all benefit from that oil money when things went well, sies man #IMBEWU

405 2018-12-18 23:22:44 It is either an oil company or a Middle Eastern investment authority. I agree w/ the comments that it is either Rosneft or Qatar. The two are actually tied together, since I believe Qatar purchased the 17.6% of Rosneft stock that has been the subject of many rumors tied to Trump.

407 2018-12-18 23:22:27 Fed has plenty of reasons now. Oil housing etc
408 2018-12-18 23:22:22 Seems they cared more about sustaining positive investor psychology when they still needed it to hit their targets. 

With large debt, growing deficits, slowing growth, QT, fgn govs diverting from USD and low oil price hurting petro$ inflows think their priority is  debt demand

411 2018-12-18 23:22:10 I haven't really been interested in it cuz I'm mostly concerned about getting my face in check (blemish wise and oil control), but I've heard a lot of good things about it. Once I have things under control, I'll probably start using it. It's never too early to start anti aging!

415 2018-12-18 23:22:05 Invest in green energy. Hire people from the oil sector to these green jobs. 
Better pay

416 2018-12-18 23:22:02 The Russian oil company? Russia offered kickbacks to trump.
417 2018-12-18 23:21:52 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
418 2018-12-18 23:21:49 In the words of deep throat "follow the money".  How many folks in the media own oil stocks.
419 2018-12-18 23:21:33 We would be happy to send you our CBD oil for pets, we have droppers & treats  Feel better buddy!!

422 2018-12-18 23:21:26 Why my car oil change gotta be so much 
423 2018-12-18 23:21:21 This old man tried to pay for my gas, he said he’s from Bagram. Y’all think he got some of that oil money?!
424 2018-12-18 23:21:17 **Damn I forgot my lavender oil** thought my anxious ass 
425 2018-12-18 23:21:11 Tight oil only makes commercial sense for most companies by excluding costs or financial statement sleight-of-hand. 

That's fine. Oil is a tough business. Maybe tight oil is not so different from past ventures. 

Just stop trying to make it into something better than it is.

433 2018-12-18 23:20:32 Or... add Jagermeister, Goldschlager, and Malibu Rum.  Motor oil. Not the worst thing I've ever tasted & if the goal is to get lit it'll get you there.
434 2018-12-18 23:20:27 The latest stats show US shale oil production is expected to rise to 134,000 barrels m/m to 8.166 million, the first time the monthly average will have topped 8 million.
435 2018-12-18 23:20:16 I was pose to go get my oil changed this morning and never did i , my ass slept till it was time for me to go to work 
436 2018-12-18 23:20:11 Hot oil treatment and chill?
437 2018-12-18 23:20:08 I’m all about essential oils, but not so much the corporate essential oil industry and this war they’re trying to wage on candles. I will never give up my candles !! 
438 2018-12-18 23:19:53 I can agree but let the playing field be even. Make all foreign product meet the same standards that is imposed on CDN product. All other imported products need to meet Canadian standards...why not oil??
439 2018-12-18 23:19:48 Seen Canada’s price for oil? The illusion and collusion are real 
440 2018-12-18 23:19:38 You should try CBD oil. I have tried it out and it seems to work.

442 2018-12-18 23:19:23 Our Government and our Oil and Media Titans must want the biggest automotive manufacturing revolution to be led by Intellectual Property Stealing China and/or Emissions Cheating Germany. That will bring manufacturing and jobs back to the US. So dumb! They are laughing at us.

448 2018-12-18 23:18:42 Where’s the matching Clean Energy Action plan?? 
You know…because of the #ParisAgreement!?  Remember that whole #2degrees #climatechange thing?? Yeah…we should do more about THAT and less with the oil and gas stuff. 

Besides, we all know Oilberta won’t vote Liberal anyway.

451 2018-12-18 23:18:34 Timber...

Oil dropped nearly $4.00/barrel today.
Therefore, gasoline may be dropping under $2.00/ gallon sometime next week.

Nice Christmas gift.
Thank you, Mr. President & the Republican Party!

Much appreciated.

463 2018-12-18 23:16:57 Awful technicals supported by the fundamental supply/demand reality that global growth must be slowing significantly for the price of oil to collapse with this much speed and trajectory.  Agree that this is a very bad sign.

466 2018-12-18 23:16:37 It has been a while.  Unfortunately many companies are going to start looking at their strategic plans to determine the effects of lower oil prices on one's profits.  I smell another massive layoff if prices remain in the $40s.  #formeroilandgasanalyst #20years #themajors

476 2018-12-18 23:15:50 Lunatic - she says she wants to be remembered for her transparency and truthfulness.  She needs an oil change and a new timing belt!  She's not firing on all cylinders.
477 2018-12-18 23:15:41 Our $47.5 WTI target was generously met today, breaking down to lower lows. Remember the oil bulls a couple weeks ago telling you to go long because $50 was the bottom...Or last year the "experts" pumping $100 oil?

480 2018-12-18 23:15:28 Its not new money, this is an attempt by an inept government to apease the oil sector which they have decimated. Keep buying dirty oil from SA. And giving the wests money to Quebec...
481 2018-12-18 23:15:03 If you dont want the pipeline and you want to do your environmental part, stop driving and heating your homes. Dont buy food from stores either cause someone had to drive that food there and you wouldn't want to support anything and asinine as oil.
482 2018-12-18 23:14:41 Nervous about starting low dose chemo again for my arthritis and Colitis. But I’m at the point of desperation because I have almost no quality of life. I also want cbd oil.
483 2018-12-18 23:14:36 Back in the day my father drove his 1985 Toyota Supra for 100,000 before he got an oil change or tune up! He would just add oil when it was low! LMFAO! After 280,000 miles it sat in the garage for 20 years. We jump started the original battery & it started AND drove!

495 2018-12-18 23:13:54 CBD Oil Should Help For Sure Bro Give Us An Update After on how hes doing<3
496 2018-12-18 23:13:53 The oil industry knew all along, for decades, the impact they had on our environment. We all ought to be outraged. Not enough it seems.
497 2018-12-18 23:13:47 There is no discipline in the E&P sector.  The implied capital tied up in perpetually increasing ight oil DUC's is a slap in the face to returning capital to investors.  What industry holds at least 5 years worth of inventory?  Lack of access to capital does not equal discipline.
498 2018-12-18 23:13:34 Wow - hyperbolize much?  You really need to learn a bit about how our economy actually works, and little details like how the oil market was already tanking in late 2014...
499 2018-12-18 23:13:28 controversy: my oil diffuser has always claimed that you should only use “1-5 drops of oil.” but today I put like. 30 drops. and that shit was POWERFUL. my whole house smelled like lavender. I’m in an Uber and I smell like lavender still. never follow instructions.
500 2018-12-18 23:13:14 Australian oil company, woodside, was actively competing with American oil companies trying to do business in Israel and Cyprus. I was advising American companies at the time. No wonder Downer wanted to talk oil in London and then began recording me with his phone. Set up. -GP
501 2018-12-18 23:13:13 @JonGatehouse Hi Jon, on your newsletter this morning you referenced an outdated and discredited number of losses due to the price differential between light and heavy oil. Can you confirm how many barrels are affected?
502 2018-12-18 23:13:09 If u hear a ticking noise under ur car that means u need more oil

504 2018-12-18 23:13:01 Its better to have subsidies for US oil companies than give that money to OPEC which funds international terror.
A single oil tanker pollutes more than all the cars in a large city so the less it has to travel the better.
505 2018-12-18 23:12:55 He is too supportive of continued extraction of oil and gas.  We don't need another President who believe that we can have a bridge to renewable energy.  He only seems progressive in comparison to Cruz.

521 2018-12-18 23:11:01 I question if giving an addict more money to spend on their habit is wise, instead of finding ways to break them of it so they can be better. Yes, Albertans and Canadians will suffer but breaking the Alberta dependence on oil needs to happen.

523 2018-12-18 23:11:00 U.S traded crude oil fell 7.3% to $46.24 a barrel, putting its losses since October 1 at more than 35%. Energy stocks in the  S&P 500 lost 2.4%

525 2018-12-18 23:10:51 I was just using the THREE variables that the media / idiot politicians talk about.

Dollar
Crude (west texas to be accurate)
Price

Refining (owned by big oil) prices are the best way they are screwing us. 

I could add about 4 variables (margins etc), but need KISS

546 2018-12-18 23:09:29 It is.... they regulate prices don’t they? They even make the prices so low for this oil producing countries to make much profit when they should... Members of opec are suppressed and not allowed to make much profitable terms in selling their resources.
547 2018-12-18 23:09:28 I've always considered myself lawful good, but I feel like bringing 2/3 of a pizza covered in garlic oil on a plane flight might signal a shift in my alignment.

555 2018-12-18 23:08:51 It wasn't just that. It was to fabricate a reason to invade Afghanistan, so Halliburton could lay a pipe line, for oil.
556 2018-12-18 23:08:47 “If we don’t sell Hitler ovens then Sweden will!” what a moronic thing to say. Not that you’d have the guts to say that to a mothers face, with her starving child in her arms. Coward.

At least we agree on the oil.

559 2018-12-18 23:08:41 Which Russian oil company was supposed to give stock to Carter in the Steele document?

561 2018-12-18 23:08:33 The least you can do for ya car is change the oil consistently
562 2018-12-18 23:08:32 Probably didn't say a thing. Fortunately for many millennials new automobiles aren't as reliant on oil changes as their fathers vehicles. Just try not to let it happen again.
563 2018-12-18 23:08:29 I got some great advice from my PD and got her a cute gift box from an artisanal olive oil store.
564 2018-12-18 23:08:25 Oil Prices Plummet 7% on Fears of a Glut
565 2018-12-18 23:08:23 I think I put too many drops of this eucalyptus oil into the diffuser because my eyes are tingling
566 2018-12-18 23:08:13 @lil_tenderheart how's the oil change?
567 2018-12-18 23:08:13 It's just doctored up instant ramen, really.  But I used chicken broth and added a bunch more spices, and sauteed chicken and mushrooms in fresh garlic and olive oil and added that. Then made hard boiled eggs, chopped green onions, and threw 'em in.
568 2018-12-18 23:08:11 Maybe Rosneft, Russian oil company? See Steele dossier.
Or perhaps Duetsche Bank, money laundering for Russia, loans to Trump?
Hmmmm....
569 2018-12-18 23:08:04 I used almond oil, let it soak for 10 min and it’s so much easier to take off than baby oil. Plus almond oil smells so good
570 2018-12-18 23:08:02 You can solve this by building a pipeline which will benefit the whole country. Instead you want to borrow more  from  taxpayers  thinking Alberta will roll over. The money generated from Alberta oil is profit you donkey ! #stupideconomics
571 2018-12-18 23:07:59 Sana oil 
572 2018-12-18 23:07:53 Why is any being imported? You’re trying to justify how stupid it’s is to import conflict oil over Canadian oil. Stop you sound stupid to just about everyone.
Also, NB gets Saudi oil & sends it to QC, so there’s that....

580 2018-12-18 23:07:11 Yea, oil drilling in single family home neighborhoods within a stones throw of rail lines feels like it’s straight out of a weird dystopian graphic novel

オリンピックのネタのですか？
584 2018-12-18 23:05:47 Watched #60minutes since I was a kid. Thought they was one of few that stuck to the truth, sadly I was wrong. Seems they and @LesleyRStahl are on the payroll from dirty money! Support company’s @Tesla and @elonmusk that want to change the world to the better instead of Big Oil.
585 2018-12-18 23:05:41 Do you think, perhaps, as prudent risk managers in the oil business that conditions may be different today?  The market is looking for optionality.
586 2018-12-18 23:05:38 If major petroleum producers do not change their model to a sustainable model, then might Norway’s nationalization of oil offer an avenue to move oil profits towards hydrogen fuel, clean water, ocean revitalization, atmospheric CO2 collection, and other #Sustainable products?
587 2018-12-18 23:05:37 Oil pens , brownies
588 2018-12-18 23:05:31 Any word from @PEPANZ1 or their astroturf @nzenergyvoices on Thompson & Clark? I wrote to them years back urging a strong code of conduct because of the actions of oil companies here.
589 2018-12-18 23:05:29 I wish secret Santa’s got like useful stuff for eachother. Here’s a Gc for groceries or an oil change. Not a wine glass covered in glitter... I have like 12 of those! Lol
590 2018-12-18 23:05:27 You sayyyyyyy what???? You dont what??? Anyways your king is a king of liars so why should i expect honesty from u. Oil flows from the head
591 2018-12-18 23:05:26 Then she loses election and donations and resorts to selling snake oil with slick willy at empty venues.  #LockHerUp
592 2018-12-18 23:05:26 How come you're not outraged at the welfare money Quebec will receive this year? 13.1 BILLION of the wests money. Most of wich is /was derived from the oil and gas industry.
593 2018-12-18 23:05:19 Haha. Its clear you have no idea what you're talking about. You don't think Germany will sell them if we don't? What's that going to prove. Stop buying the oil so we're not supporting this shithole.
594 2018-12-18 23:05:08 You know how kings solve the deflation problem? They fight a large scale war. Now who could see that coming? It's also possible the east wants to crush shale which is on the table if they can stand oil below 30 for any length of time (I don't think they can).
595 2018-12-18 23:04:59 Where is the best place in JB to send my car for routine servicing like oil change?
596 2018-12-18 23:04:58 OIL: Brent Crude is the global oil benchmark, London’s Intercontinental is a main exchange for it • West Texas Intermediate futures is the US standard, with New York Mercantile a main exchange.
597 2018-12-18 23:04:49 JT bought a pipeline that was not asked to purchase. JT offering handout that Alberta's don't want. They want pipelines approved and jobs that come with it, get our oil to other markets at higher prices. People want well paying jobs and not near-sighted hand-outs.
598 2018-12-18 23:04:42 Put it towards retraining a workforce in new trades and industry. Big oil gets enough money, and is a dead source for jobs.

603 2018-12-18 23:04:35 I can't imagine oils from cold expeller presses would be harmful, particularly in small amounts, like most uses of sesame oil.  Oil that needs to be chemically extracted, heated and deoderized from the seed of a plant humans have never eaten seems particularly dubious though.

605 2018-12-18 23:04:16 Why buy :30 ads when you own networks/media?

Oil co’s have majority ownership in media companies, or they found them, as political and financial market manipulation weapons.

622 2018-12-18 23:02:57 In order to be specific, "shale oil and gas" are increasing the global supply of "the stuff".
623 2018-12-18 23:02:53 The Oil fund clip will never get old.
624 2018-12-18 23:02:53 You're not the only one. I do too. In fact, I'm of the belief that as long as plastic is a byproduct of the oil industy, it should be disposed of in landfill. No point in pumping all the carbon we dig up into the atmosphere. We may as well rebury some of it.
625 2018-12-18 23:02:41 It bases its algorithm on similar followers. Both take $ from wallstreet, big oil, & insurance companies so they are likely to have similar followers.

629 2018-12-18 23:02:28 ST by few yes, my calculations are showing the bottom of the descending wedge is still $22 and that it should touch that level one last time before the long oil bull begins as global production enters permanent decline (supply constraints).  Next oil bull will be vicious $100+

631 2018-12-18 23:02:25 Many have asked, what if Al Naimi had cut production in Dec 2014, would it have saved the oil market from tanking. A good counterfactual at play now. Even with deep cuts, the free markets price oil based on supply and demand. And at the moment, here, at the prompt, there is a lot
632 2018-12-18 23:02:08 i have one of those things from yankee candle that is like little scent balls in a plastic container and it's almost finished and i accidentally tipped it over and the oil spilled all over my desk and hands and holy christ these things sure hold the fragrance TO THE LAST DROP
633 2018-12-18 23:01:54 Canada has the cleanest and most ethical oil in the world. We are also the most regulated with the highest environmental sanders in the world. 
The U.S. , now there's a country that needs to be protested. Oh wait, you can protest the source of your funding..can ya ?!

638 2018-12-18 23:01:23 Do you know how they audit "sustainable" #palmoil? Charities/NGOs have been trying to find out with no success. People should avoid all palm oil. RSPO is greenwashing.
639 2018-12-18 23:01:21 The oil industry does not want handouts, it wants market access. Being captive to only US markets results in a huge loss of tax revenues. Socialist Liberals throw $4.5 B at a pipeline they wont build & $1.6 B in grants that do not help with alternative markets. Build a pipeline!
640 2018-12-18 23:01:19 Hey retired guy. Canada should not be refining any foreign oil period. We need Energy East built ASAP. That's what makes sense to Canadians.

646 2018-12-18 23:00:50 Oil sand oil is very very expensive.   Oil has to be at a very high price for them to break even.  If my old brain is remembering accurately, something like $150/barrel?

648 2018-12-18 23:00:41 The rest of Canada's workforce has had  to adapt.  When does the responsibility fall on the individual to take ownership and responsibility for themselves? When are low end oil workers going to understand that the companies they work for make billions in profits regardless.

674 2018-12-18 22:58:53 Will you work with the knowledge that this industry is dying...time to plan for an Alberta future that is not 100% reliant on oil n gas. It will come to an end...this isn't new knowledge.
675 2018-12-18 22:58:50 Better to pursue oil so a slim part of the population makes a bit more money, at the cost of killing the planet faster. Got it.
676 2018-12-18 22:58:50 Yes bill C-69 puts all the hoops that must jumped through into one basket which can be argued both ways. Energy east was scrapped because of low oil prices and again hard push back from Quebec’s environmental review process. I mean they literally celebrated its cancellation.
677 2018-12-18 22:58:47 I might see what's up w/ @VanessaVeasley Super Glow Oil for Christmas.
678 2018-12-18 22:58:42 We're have oilprices bottomed out, on what planet have you been living on. Oil demand is still not even close to peak yet. If the economy  is on such great shape, Why are we still having bigger deficits. But the libs think is OK to throw billions of dollars down the drain.
679 2018-12-18 22:58:42 Exactly. Alberta wants to export it's oil products at world prices. To do this It needs pipeline access to tidewater. Trudeau claims he's "listening" then pledges what's essentially an expensive consolation bribe.
680 2018-12-18 22:58:40 Shocking that people have to, especially when you consider all the oil money that came in.
681 2018-12-18 22:58:38 Absolutely Erica. We'll even give you good deals on our water , renewables, oil etc.  You don't even need to thank us for looking after strident for you as we're just delighted your taking it back.
682 2018-12-18 22:58:36 Ok when were you born? because in the 70"s it was said the world's oil would be depleted by 1990. Why is oil so cheap now?

692 2018-12-18 22:58:12 exactly what an IG binch would say. have you been invited to saudi arabia yet to get dicked down by a rich oil baron yet? 
693 2018-12-18 22:58:11 Oil will always be required. It’s in the plastics that make up parts of the device you’re using.
694 2018-12-18 22:57:58 Yo my oil change was just $100 i cant
695 2018-12-18 22:57:57 The money spent for oil process, would be better spent for the hungry children of Yemen.
696 2018-12-18 22:57:57 I’m not even gone hold y’all. I put Holy oil on my forehead every morning before class.  

That’s why my first semester was great. Free game.
697 2018-12-18 22:57:46 Some think global oil production declines 3-6%/year after peak.  Most countries past peak prod.  Maybe global peak in near future.  Reduces flow of energy into global system? Coal prod. peak might follow.  Maybe both peak & decline soon enough to impact carbon emissions?

699 2018-12-18 22:57:40 Today in the special needs class, i received a bracelet from one of the sped teachers...it was an essential oil bracelet, I put citris oil on it... I asked one of the kids what it smelled like and if they liked it: he gagged and said it smelled like peanut butter...
700 2018-12-18 22:57:34 POTUS wants the markets to tank.

He said going in there was a nasty bubble.

That's only been inflated since.

Blowing them up and reducing companies like Amazon to what they should be worth needs to happen.

I'm sure they have a plan for that. 

Low oil prices is a good start.
701 2018-12-18 22:57:30 Bitch I’ve missed my oil change appointment 3 times already I’m about to just buy a new car
702 2018-12-18 22:57:29 My house smells like a mint hookah but really it’s just peppermint oil lol
703 2018-12-18 22:57:08 Because they can still salute the fucking queen, who cares if we produce more oil than Kuwait and have 1in4 children living in poverty and homelessness caused by Tory austerity....
They can salute a German benefit cheat....
704 2018-12-18 22:57:07 The same “charitable” foundation that used donations to purchase an oil portrait of #Drumpf that currently hangs in Trump tower NY?
705 2018-12-18 22:57:05 You promise loans.  Good job. You don’t promise pipelines rail cars or any other initiative to get oil moving.  How much more can you lie @SohiAmarjeet ?  I mean do you think you’re even going to get a 1000 votes in the next election ?

709 2018-12-18 22:56:58 I don't know, they were extremely vague in their ruling. Russia has several state owned banks, state owned oil companies, but lots of countries have govt. banks.

715 2018-12-18 22:56:02 My own calculations are telling me that we will see Oil price $365.00 and $TOPS price $765.00 very soon before January 2020 IMO Fuel Rules.

717 2018-12-18 22:56:00 Agree. We'll stand on our own feet, on top of our own oil and 'your' Trident defence system. (We could probably let you leave it here until you find somewhere else to put it, for a suitable rent). And you won't be needing our surplus water or hydroelectricity any more, will you?
718 2018-12-18 22:55:53 @JacobseLouie Oil money at it again
719 2018-12-18 22:55:42 No,  I am100% for Canadian pipelines & no Saudi oil.  The Saudi oil is refined in the East Cdn then shipped to the USA, like all our other oil products. Irving owned by Peter Mackay. The back up in AB is due to repairs to refineries in the Texas, USA.
720 2018-12-18 22:55:34 Oil prices took another beating today. Down 7.3% or $3.64/barrel. Over the past three days, oil is down more than 12%. Those fuel prices are likely to remain low for a little while. #oilandgas

753 2018-12-18 22:51:29 Is there a reasonable option to buy vehicles that don't rely on fossil fuels? The oil industry holds monopoly, and many people cannot afford the luxurious price of electric vehicles, because of lack of infrastructure. What other choice do Quebecois have?

782 2018-12-18 22:49:16 However it's processed or sold, it's a private venture. Irving oil incurs the risk, cost, and profit of  doing so. Not Canada. Also, remember that Irving Oil is not a proponent of refining western oil. Much more difficult than the SA oil they use.
783 2018-12-18 22:49:08 You’re going to need a LOT of baby oil for that!

Also, they didnt give us anything. Its a loan that nobodys want. We want pipelines

828 2018-12-18 22:45:01 And oil in the Dakotas, that was close to the surface, clean and cheaper to extract; unlike the toxic tar sand sludge. #cdnpoli
829 2018-12-18 22:44:53 Do we still need a FiT?

2009 4kw pv £24k
2019  £5,500 - £8,000

Spend another £3-4k and get to use all of the energy you make...

Solar doesn't need subsidies to stack up.

4kw of pv will decrease our chance of another oil war and save a few penguins at the same time.
830 2018-12-18 22:44:52 It's NOT a gd 'investment'! It's a LOAN. Of course, we know that with the destructive measures the #Trudeau govt is taking, no oil&gas company will be able to repay, not with Bill C69 passing. It's just a stop gap to ensure destruction of O&G in Alberta.
831 2018-12-18 22:44:52 jst realized my peanut butter has palm oil in it and i wanna kms
832 2018-12-18 22:44:40 Wtf am I supposed to eat cereal with cooking oil?!
833 2018-12-18 22:44:39 Try Alla Panna sauce! Basically get spaghetti sauce and Alfredo sauce, and mix together, add olive oil, Italian seasoning, garlic and onions , and mix in Italian sausage instead of hamburger meat
834 2018-12-18 22:44:30 And so now oil is $46.24 does he think it is going to $20?
835 2018-12-18 22:44:27 And then poor nl... We're an oil province too. In serious debt... Not a tap of compensation.
836 2018-12-18 22:44:20 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

840 2018-12-18 22:43:54 For a start, the Mongol invasion ending the Caliphate, the Shia/Sunni divide and most crucially colonial intervention and the rise of petro-states and oil based political meddling.

847 2018-12-18 22:43:40 You have beautiful skin!! Try maca powder or evening primrose oil. Both help with hormones. It’s for sure hormonal? Cystic acne around your lips, chin, jaw? Daily Apple cider vinegar shots and daily probiotics can also help if they’re on ur cheeks, forehead, etc.
848 2018-12-18 22:43:35 yay all the oils in the essential oil spray i got for my bed are safe for cats. i put a spray or two on my pillow at night to help me sleep and it's nice to know that (other than it being strong, which is why i've cut down) it wont hurt them

851 2018-12-18 22:43:22 You know what else you can use coconut oil for? To shove a handful in your mouth so you’ll shut the fuck up.
852 2018-12-18 22:43:10 every male i have come into contact with for the past 2 months asks me if i’ve gotten my oil changed every time i see them and the answer is always no i have not undergone any character development since last tuesday
853 2018-12-18 22:43:04 The Fort Chip First Nations experience high rates of cancer because they "live off the land" and their food sources are contaminated. This has been acknowledged for past 10 years but you know... oil always came first with the PCs.  #ableg
854 2018-12-18 22:42:44 Typical. The liberals are going to drag this out for as long as they can. Best guess, not even a shovel full of dirt will move on any Canadian pipeline while the liberals are in power. Lots of flowery babble but nothing to move an extra drop of Alberta oil. This mindset must end!
855 2018-12-18 22:42:24 Me talking to some #WAFrontier fans about the illustrations in the Christmas special:

856 2018-12-18 22:42:24 Um, @bradlavigne?    The problem is not access to US markets or overseas markets.

The problem is price.    Shipping more oil will only depress price, not increase it.    Do you pundits even know economics?   #pnpcbc
857 2018-12-18 22:42:13 -Also lies from North Korea (still nuclear)

858 2018-12-18 22:42:10 Answer: We’re going to offshore the oil to Musk-Bezos-Branson colonization on Mars.
859 2018-12-18 22:42:04 Its 10 percent too much when we could essentially by resource self sufficient. Everyone hollers about dirty Alberta oil. Can't remember the last time we beheaded someone or locked them up for being a woman with an opinion.
860 2018-12-18 22:42:01 The kid is not going to like it, but Castor Oil works every time.
861 2018-12-18 22:41:54 I disagree. The Fed historically hiked interest rates back in December 2015 while WTI was in a literal free-fall (-63% btwn April and hike). I believe the issue with oil is much more of a structural problem in oil markets than it is a cyclical one. Inventories are telling a story
862 2018-12-18 22:41:50 try rubbing coconut oil into your scalp, massaging it. leave it for for an hour or overnight like me & rinse in the morning. it will strengthen your hair from the follicle.
863 2018-12-18 22:41:35 When you blindly follow a snake oil salesman,  you get what you deserve.
864 2018-12-18 22:41:33 Rosneft? Saudi oil company? 

Also: I wonder what companies Turkey owns now?  Or if Dubai sovereign wealth fund has invested in Erik Prince mercenary enterprise?  Has Jared sold the Kushner company to a foreign country?
865 2018-12-18 22:41:32 Actually collapse in shale production is bullish for oil long term. Which is why the Saudi's keep crashing it.

868 2018-12-18 22:41:26 I agree with you, they need to now prove themselves and no more excuses. Lmao bin and get who? You think say na oil money we get, the players that need to go are Jones, Valencia, fellaini, the rest are quite okay

873 2018-12-18 22:40:58 So this is why you can't wash oil (non-polar) away with just water (polar). You can use soap, obv, because soap is special. The molecules have one end that likes water and one end that likes stuff that doesn't like water. So soapy water is an "emulsion" - tiny bits of one liquid
874 2018-12-18 22:40:55 If you need help on anything lmk! Make sure you rotate your tires every 2 oil changes!!
875 2018-12-18 22:40:52 Oil now -40% from the top this year. Man! That will have knock on effects. Still think growth isn't slowing world wide? FedEx just confirmed what Oil, China, Europe and now US stock markets are telling us.  $USO
876 2018-12-18 22:40:39 We have so much #oil in #Alberta that we sell for a song to the USA yet import oil from a Saudi Arabia and pay top dollar never mind from a place with atrocities to their people.  Will #RedRiverCommunityCollege adjust my economics grade and pass me now! #StandingwithAlberta
877 2018-12-18 22:40:39 Eating sand and drinking oil isn't a good business model?
878 2018-12-18 22:40:36 Lots of people arguing with me about oil sands. But you still haven't answered the question. What is it Albertans think Trudeau has the power to do that he isn't doing?

892 2018-12-18 22:39:56 Surprise Inventory Build Sends Oil Prices Even Lower. The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a surprise crude oil inventory build of 3.45 million barrels for the week ending December 14, compared to analyst expectations of 2.475 million barrels.
893 2018-12-18 22:39:48 Sad really,  help oil can do amazing things!!
894 2018-12-18 22:39:44 Java + HiDPI is like oil and water.

896 2018-12-18 22:39:42 “Dying commodity” ... you do realize demand for oil worldwide continues to rise...
897 2018-12-18 22:39:40 If you say so. Saudi oil exports to Canada amount to less than 10 percent of the supply - most comes from the US. And none of it is imported by the 'east'. It is predominantly bought by the Irving refineries in NB. Perhaps have a word in his ear.

900 2018-12-18 22:39:21 Lets see. If FED don’t hike rates I am all in on your picks. Oil will rally on no hike tomorrow. Same with GOLD!
901 2018-12-18 22:39:12 If you don’t wear lip gloss, lip oil, lip chap, lip something bitch you dusty 
902 2018-12-18 22:39:04 I don’t need to. My point still stands. There are fears of a glut. There is still a high demand for petroleum. The over production of oil hasn’t cause a $33/barrel difference in oil sands pricing. The utter mismanagement of of the Liberal and NDP governments have.
903 2018-12-18 22:38:56 Have you tried using castor oil

905 2018-12-18 22:38:49 “Renewables” have always existed. In particular wood, water, wind and whale oil.

909 2018-12-18 22:38:05 Mental Note: Wear sleeves when cooking with oil.

912 2018-12-18 22:37:57 NSW - EDEN Princes Hwy
ACCIDENT 2 cars
Started today 9:33am, last checked today 9:33am
Impact: Impact Traffic affected in both directions.
Advice: Reduce your speed
Exercise caution
Other Info: There is oil on the road resulting from the accident.
913 2018-12-18 22:37:56 PMJT just doesn't get it!  Build the frickin pipelines.  Canada needs to withdraw from oil slowly but that has to come from cutting out imports and ultimately its driven by lower public demand.  For prosperity it needs to be 'Canada First'.
914 2018-12-18 22:37:38 With the exception of sunflower oil, not bad
915 2018-12-18 22:37:34 Assuming the box is sealed, there’d be a strange sort of anaerobic mulching going on. There may be a small amount of air squeezed from the lungs of the squashed humans, but not enough for much to happen with it. Possibly 300 billion kilos of oil if you left it long enough 
916 2018-12-18 22:37:34 All of California has an estimated 3 billion barrels of "recoverable" oil (including offshore resources); Alaska has an estimated 10 billion barrels, about double that  if we allow drilling in the ANWR like Trump wants to do.
917 2018-12-18 22:37:22 Not to mention the dangers of setting a protectionist precedence, where agencies who receive foreign funding are denied basic access to justice; although, it would render many oil companies without legal rights. This is an affront to the rule of law, both foreign and domestic.

919 2018-12-18 22:37:17 -I need an oil change & my registration renewed for Christmas
920 2018-12-18 22:37:06 I think you'll find the oil crash started more than a year before either Notley or Trudeau. Due to industry practices and government inattention during Prentice/Redford?Stelmach and Harper's rule. Unless you mean they're responsible for the Ft. Mac fire in 2016?

922 2018-12-18 22:36:49 As Canada is carbon negative, we can only lobby against the polluters: China, India, Arab oil.  Or stop buying their goods.  No need for us to tax ourselves to supplement the polluting countries.  Ahh fresh Canadian air!
923 2018-12-18 22:36:44 I changed my car oil for the first time alone & I feel so successful 
924 2018-12-18 22:36:41 I remember Javier Blas hyping oil prices up at $86 as if it was just yesterday. #OOTT
925 2018-12-18 22:36:35 1/2 Oil contract hasn’t stopped the current acct from deteriorating and this with a record surplus w/ u.s.  so not sure how BoP risks r receding.  Seems highly unlikely to me, if there is a deal, that it will come with a stronger cny sweetener.
926 2018-12-18 22:36:29 We should be seeking alternative energy sources. We should have a plan to be fossil fuel free like Ireland. The problem is, it would be offensive to people who are profiting in the oil and fossil fuel industries. They still want to make money until there’s nothing left.
927 2018-12-18 22:36:28 thought i lost my castor oil and i got so sad
928 2018-12-18 22:36:24 They own 6% of Twitter. I understand that's more than Dorsey, but it's 6%. I give you Port Arthur Refinery -- but that is just 3% of our oil production.
929 2018-12-18 22:36:15 Just behind oil, Mexico's number 2 source of income is money sent from here. At an average of 15 Billion a year. Trump is throwing them 10 more BILLION and not one foot of fucking wall will be built.
930 2018-12-18 22:36:14 This is NOT a subsidization of the oil&gas industry. It's a REPLACEMENT tactic to oust the industry and replace it with BS renewables that aren't even viable! It's also just a LOAN, not a cash giveaway. The whole announcement is complete BS!!!
931 2018-12-18 22:36:12 Agreed, but like i said, not at the expense of the experience. 

I’d rather win as the underdog with levy at the head of the club than as a favourite with some oil cunt at the head.
932 2018-12-18 22:35:48 So this particular sandwich was my go-to turkey sandwich! I make it with seeded multigrain bread, avocado oil mayonnaise, smash avocado with lime and salt, arugula, tomato and radishes, and provolone and cracked pepper turkey :)
933 2018-12-18 22:35:47 There is no other real option - we need to go Green...and fast! - this debate convinces me that we need to move even further into the post carbon world - so:  no pipeline - get off oil, coal and fossil fuels asap - go 100% renewables - greentech can be much bigher than oiltech!
934 2018-12-18 22:35:45 If the radicals destroy it all with their utterly stupid and ridiculous Marxist BS, THEN WHAT? To what end? Where and how does this end well. Does anyone remember Venezuela? Extremely oil rich, makes no difference in a top down government run everything nation. NO TOILET PAPER.
935 2018-12-18 22:35:42 Saw him hashtag a photo of a can of Neck Oil with #CraftBeerNotCrapBeer the other day
936 2018-12-18 22:35:38 That's still not enough to pay for all of that with out equalization. In regards to post secondary. If I sent my Alberta born kid there for school they would get a bill for full freight. All while the east uses Saudi human rights hating oil. Dirty oil indeed. They're experts

938 2018-12-18 22:35:24 When the Fed hiked on Dec 16, 2015, oil had plunged from $50 to $35 in 6 weeks. Interesting info!
939 2018-12-18 22:35:22 (Tax cut + buy back)equals (oil crash+rate hike) means  market has to settle on its own by  (buyers + sellers)

949 2018-12-18 22:34:44 I’ll tell her.  Carolyn, Canada is carbon negative. Liberals won’t tell you that. This tax punishes Canadians & supplements the polluting countries.  China, India and Arab oil.  This is in keeping with Liberal agenda of foreign 1st policy. Canadians last.

953 2018-12-18 22:34:26 The latest from CBC:

958 2018-12-18 22:34:00 my wife gonna know how to change her oil, her tires and other mechanic work on her car cause the world knows I can’t do that shit. I’m more likely to break a car then fix one.
959 2018-12-18 22:33:59 I meant to put this on the one where they guy said Quebec got no oil from Saudi not this one, sorry 
960 2018-12-18 22:33:59 When the Fed hiked (for the first time) on Dec 16, 2015, oil had plunged from $50 to $35 in 6 weeks
961 2018-12-18 22:33:51 I honestly never thought I'd be blocked for seeming too pro oil. 
962 2018-12-18 22:33:49 Yea because ur in pain but wont try the oil
963 2018-12-18 22:33:41 I love oil paints
964 2018-12-18 22:33:39 I’m overwhelmed by all the kind and encouraging words. Fabulous to meet you and cheers for all the “grit” to oil the wheels of turning policy into action. #ShoulderToShoulder wiggle is the one to beat in 2019! I can’t wait to see what we all achieve!
965 2018-12-18 22:33:32 The global oil and gas sector is built on collusion. The extraction of the oil sands and US fracking wouldn't exist without OPEC inflated oil prices first making them profitable.
966 2018-12-18 22:33:26 I tell what I personally would like, that would be for you to shut your ever flapping jaws! A 4.5 billion pipeline with no oil in it is bad economics....get it dumbo?
967 2018-12-18 22:33:23 Coconut oil doing wonders this season sha.  
968 2018-12-18 22:33:20 The oil from Alberta is still flowing through multiple pipelines 24/7.  Including the one Canadian taxpayers own. Alberta's acting like all the taps were shut off. The decline was not Ottawa fault. Blaming the wrong people won't solve the problem.
969 2018-12-18 22:33:13 Oil broke support yesterday
970 2018-12-18 22:33:12 In that context, I think it’s wholly defensible. These are the same people who decide where their company’s PAC money goes.

The pledge is about rejecting that influence, symbolically & materially. You’re showing you choose to stand w/ “the people,” not oil executives.
971 2018-12-18 22:33:04 Oil
972 2018-12-18 22:32:40 TBH Yes! Several 5kg packs of dried beans, chickpeas, lentils etc which have a couple of years Best Before Date,  so why not? Also large amounts of coffee beans & 5L olive oil cans also secured.
973 2018-12-18 22:32:39 Cornstarch, Colavita Olive oil, 3 avocados, & Cafe Bustelo in the can. Thanks
974 2018-12-18 22:32:30 Nope. They’re mature enough. They’re just being paid by the oil & coal industries to avoid proper action on climate change. 

For Trump & his Administration,
$$$ > people.
975 2018-12-18 22:32:27 We need pipelines not funny money!!! Ban oil imports!!!
976 2018-12-18 22:32:24 March?  You need to keep a closer watch so you can average down at $1.00 oil broke support today and is headed to test $42 imo
977 2018-12-18 22:32:17 Just downloaded tinder so I can match with some oil$$$ in Dubai. not blocking my blessings anymore !!!!!! Pray 4 me Twitter
978 2018-12-18 22:32:13 Females b driving fast AF blasting cardi B and ain't had a oil change in 6 months
979 2018-12-18 22:32:02 Ok. 
The Russian oil company? Starts with R?
980 2018-12-18 22:31:56 @AdrienneLambCBC maybe more should be asked of BIG OIL ceo’s. Last I checked if you were to tally their salaries layoffs wouldn’t be necessary, perhaps all this desperation should be directed elsewhere...
981 2018-12-18 22:31:49 Why can't Canada just sell our oils to the USA and build up our renewable engery sector! Why dig up oil, coal and wood use 75% of it for engery and sell the rest. When we can sell all of it and get free engery? #cdnpoli #nspoli @MeanwhileinCana @liberal_party @nspowerinc
982 2018-12-18 22:31:45 Getting an oil change and I can’t wait for them to finish and come back to me to inform me of everything else that’s wrong with my car, but honey I done knew. Please don’t remind me
983 2018-12-18 22:31:35 got my oil changed and my tires rotated.
984 2018-12-18 22:31:31 And of course Gaddafi's gold all went missing after the US/NATO brought Libyans "democracy". Kinda like millions of barrels of oil went mysteriously missing after we brought "freedom" to Iraq. Funny how that works. 
985 2018-12-18 22:31:27 The price of oil is plummeting as we're retooling our military to incredible levels. We're even preparing a Space Force.

If Russia really worked to elect President Trump, then Putin should be fired.
Of course, they didn't.
986 2018-12-18 22:31:24 Agree in principle with a level playing field. All subventions could and should dry up over time. 

But let’s make sure to balance the (intransparent) institutional and corporate incentives and tax breaks of oil exploration with (highly visible) same for #ev consumers.

990 2018-12-18 22:31:12 $UWT how does asia trade oil.. ? Are they less volatile expectations?
991 2018-12-18 22:31:10 The currency rate tanking who would of thought. With no deal it will get worse. This an expert tells me increase cost of oil gas and all imports. The unicorns tell you what ?
992 2018-12-18 22:31:02 You can sit it in a glass of water, leaves wrapped in damp paper towel and all in a large ziploc bag in the fridge for at least 48 hours. Or you can do a coriander pesto with cashews, chili and salt and a little sesame or peanut oil, instead of olive oil...
993 2018-12-18 22:31:01 If only I were Cardi B and be driven around everywhere because she doesn’t know how to drive  life would be so much easier. Do I look like the type of person who has the time to go get her oil changed and tire rotations/inflations done? Thank u, next 
994 2018-12-18 22:30:55 mister obvious commentary @RWMann - should oil prices continue to slide, whole EV economic proposition becomes ever more dubious
995 2018-12-18 22:30:54 The whole market is long USD$ and short commodities, especially oil.  

I'm all for green energy, but shoving greenbacks into my gas tank won't work!

1003 2018-12-18 22:30:16 We'd barely have to raise taxes. The total boom days of oil over $120/bbl are over. That's not coming back. We need to move forward and deal with reality, and drop the Alberta Advantage crap. Can the arrogance and show some respect for the rest of the country.

1007 2018-12-18 22:30:07 Just saw this!  I don't see a 'legit' correlation other than the 'loose' narrative that super low oil prices 'should' reduce production which in turn reduces 'associated gas'...but, i mean, that's a loose narrative that takes forever to play out in reality...

1012 2018-12-18 22:29:47 Getting my oil changed and this nigga talking to me like my car not about to start up again.
1013 2018-12-18 22:29:46 Given the attendant pressure in western oil markets due to the rapid drop in WTI, I suspect there may very well be a wild-fire brewing in the opaque derivatives world. For the moment, we only see the smoke. But before long, the fire will reveal itself.
1014 2018-12-18 22:29:44 That is what you get for voting Trump... Trade War / Oil to $ 26 / messing up with Fed... Remember Feb 2016 ???
1015 2018-12-18 22:29:39 Today is the lowest oil price I’ve seen in my short career and that really feels bad man.

1025 2018-12-18 22:28:38 I’ve put so much olbas oil in this bath I feel like I’m blind
1026 2018-12-18 22:28:36 Can some one explain to me how a pipeline is going to force other markets to buy our oil?... Is there a deal that I don't know about? Can Asia even process our oil?

1028 2018-12-18 22:28:33 Labour Shadow Chancellor disappointingly backing oil and gas when Labour claim to be environmentalists is the reason I'm an active GREEN member. It's clear that nobody else cares about the single largest issue affecting our future. #Labourlies #ClimateAction #ExtinctionRebellion
1029 2018-12-18 22:28:33 That's because we can't even sell all the oil we're getting from fracking. Forget the fact that all this fracking will cause the United States to cave into the center of the earth.

1031 2018-12-18 22:28:29 It increasingly seems the view from England, for many, is that we’re either uppity jocks or the quaint denizens of the place England keeps its oil and mountains. The idea of Scotland as a real place with legitimate political aims and ambitions seems conspicuous by its absence.
1032 2018-12-18 22:28:28 "Fuck, who needs *journalism*?!? That's just fake news, anyway. Don't spend government money to support that industry. If they fail, they fail.

1034 2018-12-18 22:28:14 Luckily, I don’t have to worry about “billable” hours. But, I work in oil and gas and we are on a drilling hiatus. So seriously, not much going on.

1040 2018-12-18 22:27:29 si lo vemos así como que si jaja pero ésta de salir a quejarse por la falta de gas oil fue nueva jaja
1041 2018-12-18 22:27:27 I hope the trump crime family feels the “ probes” as sharply as if they are digging to China with an oil rig drill
1042 2018-12-18 22:27:27 You can put it directly into the frying pan, it doesn't need to add oil. It'll get crispy in 3-4 minutes. It's not that I don't like meat, it's just not my fav food so I can go just fine without it. I ate a lot of meat while in Argentina so I can go without it until next year

1044 2018-12-18 22:27:21 Sometimes I be forgetting I have my oil pod in my juul battery unti I catch myself high as fuck like 20/30 minutes later like damn....
1045 2018-12-18 22:27:18 im not mad in the last im just / shrug emoji/ but also i did most of my major tasks yesterday so the worst thing that could happen is that they 1. cant change my oil and 2. they close before i have to meet my mom for dinner?? so really there's nothing to lose
1046 2018-12-18 22:27:16 The guy that changed my oil said “ma’am you do know that there is a loose bowling ball flying around your backseat right?” Yes sir i do, mind ya own
1047 2018-12-18 22:27:14 Lol! Quebec eh! Building a pipeline from Man to NB is easy peasy you think? Have you flown over Quebec and NB. Thousands of lakes and rivers. I live near St JohnNB refinery....wish it was easy peasy. Would take 10yrs min. Once TMX built, Line 3 running..no oil left to put in it.
1048 2018-12-18 22:27:11 You and your party helped vote in the cuts to make us poorer! Every time we find more oil we get a food bank as the upper classes get richer. You’re just a cog in a wheel and represent no change at all.
1049 2018-12-18 22:27:07 I'm no professional, but a foam, face soap for sensitive skin. jojoba oil is one of the only oils that directly mimics the sebum your body produces, so that or the water gel I use(it's lighweight). And a clay mask to regulate your skin, Aztec clay mask is good.

1055 2018-12-18 22:26:37 It has begun detaching fr oil, others in last 2 mths; if oil is priced in multiple currencies, then US will have to choose: It can have a profitable shale sector & very high gold (ie loss of UST rsv asset status), or it can have low gold & no shale sector...but not both anymore

1070 2018-12-18 22:25:44 Thank you! It really is. I've taken a few hot showers today. I have these tablets that you run under the water and they scent the steam with eucalyptus oil. It helps a bit with my head cold but not my throat. Thanks for the honey suggestion.

1072 2018-12-18 22:25:26 You need a fair few handfuls in the bath  cheap to buy at a horse / stock feed shop. You can also buy magnesium oil to rub on the skin - good luck 
1073 2018-12-18 22:25:23 You know I support the pipeline? 

I’m just refuting your claim that without oil we’d all perish, or live in huts. Excessive hyperbole is counterproductive. 

It’s a resource/product, not an object of reverence. And not the only product that produces profit.

1076 2018-12-18 22:25:02 Wanting universal healthcare, something enjoyed by the developed world is backstabbing? Wanting politicians responsible for climate change policy to not take money from big oil? How many decades have Democrats known and claimed to fight for climate change? Do some soul searching
1077 2018-12-18 22:24:57 To sort out difference between the two arguments you have to be determing whether low oil price is supply driven or demand, but in the end I agree Fed avoids that uncertainty by looking core
1078 2018-12-18 22:24:56 Some one showing some common sense while others waist cash on more oil markets!
1079 2018-12-18 22:24:52 @BigDrewandJim My Dad had me changing the brakes and the oil on all the cars when I was 13.  Also my school had a class that was budgeting, taxes, insurance, etc.
1080 2018-12-18 22:24:44 I submit the possibility that the advent of the CNY/oil contract, w/ability to convert CNY to gold in Shanghai (gold sourced out of London/NYC) has resulted in enormous behind-the-scenes stress in western gold markets, which is bleeding into the broader derivatives space.

1085 2018-12-18 22:24:13 I’d love to see Milke apply that same methodology to the oil & gas sector & then we could compare the #s & test the veracity of your assertion. Government support (including direct investment) goes back to the very birth of the oilsands industry.

1088 2018-12-18 22:24:08 i am not illoyal , i am not rich , i am not spoiled, i know you wanna do me slimey like some olive oil
1089 2018-12-18 22:24:03 Snake oil
1090 2018-12-18 22:24:02 US oil maybe on the way to $20-$30 dollar range. The oil sands problems are possibly about to become a full on crisis.
1091 2018-12-18 22:23:58 Aye my dad bought me cbd oil for Christmas we stan
1092 2018-12-18 22:23:51 gold flows where the oil goes
1093 2018-12-18 22:23:44 @mrdavidmillz remember when I was still a baller?
1094 2018-12-18 22:23:40 Adding more dependence on oil! Is that really a good thing? Since the alberta gov't sunk all their cash in oil and is now poorer than dirt, is this a good thing? Wouldn't the cash be better spent on new oil free technologies?
1095 2018-12-18 22:23:38 I love it when I go to get my oil changed and I can’t find the lever to pop my hood and everyone thinks I’m a dumbass 
1096 2018-12-18 22:23:33 Wonder if the same oil gurus who called for 100 oil for past 2 yrs will call for it again in 2019
1097 2018-12-18 22:23:15 And then Irving Oil processes it and sells it to Maritime Canadian provinces for Canadian dollars no doubt. Splitting hairs aren't you? But I guess that lets you sleep at night.
1098 2018-12-18 22:23:02 All I hope people will do is read/research trusted media, not Putin/Fox propaganda.  I don't necessarily think Beto is corrupt. Leave that to Trump and many in GOP.  I wanted Beto to win.  But I am very tired of some Dems taking oil/gas $. That will influence my vote in 2020.
1099 2018-12-18 22:22:59 They look like they were due for replacement soon anyways 
My safetyboots get replaced every 6 months because of how damn oily the work floors are and the oil does soften the soles somewhat allowing meral shavings to more wasily stick through
1100 2018-12-18 22:22:55 Abeg the oil inside condom... Is it kings oil or power oil? 
1101 2018-12-18 22:22:37 6) Oil - 
Put a drop or two of face oil between the palm of hand and pat it onto your skin. You can warm it up 1st.
It keeps your skin hydrated and glowing through the day. Makes your skin look dewy and gorgeous under your makeup, it also keeps it from drying out in the day.

1103 2018-12-18 22:22:12 Cancelling this contract WILL cost billions. Somebody tackle this clown. This guys moral compass is so ass backwards. If they don't get the LAVs from us somebody else will sell to them. If you want to hit them hard stop buying their oil!
1104 2018-12-18 22:22:05 Why people think it’s ok to cut off an OIL TRUCK is beyond me.... rip to the car that just hit my dad.... thank god the girl is ok

1106 2018-12-18 22:21:52 as soon as the oil pops me I’m ready to leave the kitchen
1107 2018-12-18 22:21:48 Why do the people of Scotland not wake up. The Bristish Establishment hates Scotland. They only want the oil. If they could they would send us all to Van deimens Land
1108 2018-12-18 22:21:44 Avoiding dark money and campaigning  without PAC money is to be honored. If a promise was made to environmentalist about Corp oil since Beto is a huge green energy proponent. I have to dig why a $200 cap on execs was made based on TX employment. Something isn’t right about this..
1109 2018-12-18 22:21:42 a child is always a child... 
ANYONE that doesn't want to see him/her as a child should be placed into boiling oil and fried alive...
1110 2018-12-18 22:21:33 This thread reeks of fat left tax the rich, kill the oil industry, poor me poor me cry baby bs.
1111 2018-12-18 22:21:30 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
1112 2018-12-18 22:21:20 Thank you  @WalterHoye for supporting Zion Oil & Gas! $zn
1113 2018-12-18 22:21:15 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1114 2018-12-18 22:21:13 add oil
1115 2018-12-18 22:21:12 Considering you can now get this prescribed by NHS in Scotland & England it must have some merritt. For the avoidance of doubt the pain relief I’ve had since taking this oil has reduced my codydramol intake by 75%. I’m not saying it works for everyone but it has for me!
1116 2018-12-18 22:21:09 Pinkman goo looks godlike, oil secretes from it and sits on the bud.
1117 2018-12-18 22:21:03 Interesting. In 2016 at a seminar I was at in Doha a speaker predicted SA would be bankrupt in 5-7 years if A. Oil stayed below $50 a barrel (price at time) B. Didn’t cut spending. Seems ambition increased with oil price
1118 2018-12-18 22:20:58 beto supporters quiet today with the flood of news about him being dropped from the list of those pledging not to take big oil money and these confirmations of his voting record!
1119 2018-12-18 22:20:54 It’s a lot cheaper than buying 300$ meds a lot of people use CBD oil no need to feel weird about it
1120 2018-12-18 22:20:49 Oh, and yet we have had a free market that lead to oil companies knowing decades ago that burning fossil fuels was harming the environment & not only ignoring the data but paid for misinformation campaigns about climate change. You’re not really interested in solutions.
1121 2018-12-18 22:20:44 A nug of flower, dipped in oil and then rolled in kief.... KRONIK MOONS ROCKS ARE 20% OFF TODAY!
1122 2018-12-18 22:20:44 Oil is going down and that’s good. You want to keep the economy rolling, keep oil under $60 a barrel. People will spend more money on goods if they ain’t blowing it all just to buy gas.
1123 2018-12-18 22:20:33 Oil Companies Covertly Lobbied Against Car Regulations
1124 2018-12-18 22:20:30 Oil is the most manipulated market in the history of the world. It's gotta be balls to the wall or dead or nobody's happy. The cure for low oil prices is always low oil prices. It'll go $100 again someday and everyone will wish it was always $70 and predictable like it should be.
1125 2018-12-18 22:20:25 Nigga I been changing my own oil for years, but it cost just as much to do it yourself as it do at drive n shine n they way quicker
1126 2018-12-18 22:20:19 Lovely hamper , I use coconut oil a lot , interesting goodies to try 
1127 2018-12-18 22:20:16 Christmas shopping done...
Bought myself a new beard brush...
Brewed up some new beard oil...

Might need a +1 to the work night out - don't @ me
1128 2018-12-18 22:19:47 I hope the Trudeau government realizes that there isn’t a thing they could do to please the majority of Alberta’s Oil and Gas sector. I also hope the Trudeau government realizes that further subsidies for those industries hurt their environmental image. #cdnpoli
1129 2018-12-18 22:19:45 oil mas better ayun sa instructions. meron akong nakita dito sa market market, 550pesos nasa 50-75ML na siya. ang dami na nun
1130 2018-12-18 22:19:39 He's a conman, a fraud, a snake oil salesman. Lap it up, Paris.

To experience the future in one of your magnificent electric vehicles. The future looks so wonderful for our youngsters. I shall watch with a smile on my face as we thumb our noses at big oil.
1133 2018-12-18 22:19:27 Probably just spending the wrong type of money, as it seems that our oil money works better than their money wherever that comes from.
1134 2018-12-18 22:19:25 When the guy changing your oil peels off the sticker of a competitor that tells you when to get your oil changed next to replace it with theirs.
1135 2018-12-18 22:19:25 Hope you kept the receipt because mine works perfectly fine . 

For oilers I guess the price is dictated at where oil stabilises as directly impacts profit and projected valuations.

Your points perfectly valid for just trading the charts tho .
1136 2018-12-18 22:19:22 QUESTION OF THE DAY: Do you support the federal support package for the oil and gas sector?
1137 2018-12-18 22:19:20 I know but squeaky wheel gets the oil so
1138 2018-12-18 22:19:18 It’s called DIVERSIFICATION. I guess you want the province to continue its boom and bust economy, so connected to oil and gas. Climate change is an added push for this change. But you don't know that since you don’t have a climate plan. - #climatechange #abpoli
1139 2018-12-18 22:19:14 what makes no sense to me is why this is bad for the oil service companies.  I would think their business would be up??????????????
1140 2018-12-18 22:19:09 I've found some intelligence on reddit, but the higher you go the more the memes are boiled in canola oil
1141 2018-12-18 22:19:07 Agreed.  Since early Oct, gold/oil ratio (price of gold in oil terms) has risen nearly 80% (16x to 25x)
1142 2018-12-18 22:19:04 oil & vinegar on a lunch meat sandwich makes a big difference
1143 2018-12-18 22:19:04 What about palm oil? It's used in peanut butters.
1144 2018-12-18 22:18:56 All I see is @LockheedMartin  finding some oil
1145 2018-12-18 22:18:56 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1146 2018-12-18 22:18:45 Fuji apples! And then you make the dressing:
1 tablespoon on honey
1 tablespoon on olive oil
2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar 
Salt, pepper and mix it up! Sooo good 
1147 2018-12-18 22:18:35 Don’t worry, I’m changin my own oil from now on
1148 2018-12-18 22:18:32 Don't think rates affect oil much , everyone being long oil because goldman told you to be and trump pumping  up the good times rhetoric by attacking Iran created  a supposed supply shortage.but ps Iran never stopped,now bulls drowning in it
1149 2018-12-18 22:18:29 $OIL—Got HAMMERED Today!

1151 2018-12-18 22:18:22 Both the USD impacts & the CNY & China BoP impacts are why we've been saying CNY oil contract had the potential to be a gamechanger.
1152 2018-12-18 22:18:17 Dumbass,  We have to be able to take contributions from EMPLOYEES AND OIL AND GAS EMPLOYEE UNION.  Grow up.  Pelosi backs POLICY.  Bills that are written and have a prayer of passing a floor vote. The "Green New Deal" IS PR because it sure as hell is not legislation.
1153 2018-12-18 22:18:17 Heard you and AL's Senator Strange discuss blue state AG's being bought by enviro groups & pot mfg's/using their attorneys.  Of course forgot red states. OK's Scott Pruitt used oil co attorneys work on his letterhead to sue EPA 13X while fracking caused man made OK earthquakes.
1154 2018-12-18 22:18:14 In writing the tweet, my thought process was directed at common arguments thrown at me regarding contemporary “hard” labor work - construction, oil rigging, mining, etc. which are used by bad faith actors to suggest women are “holier than thou” (despite actively excluding them).

Feeling about the same here but opposite side

Even though got long, loving the plunge in oil. What a stupid commodity

1156 2018-12-18 22:18:11 Your oil industry is not going "back to normal".  The world is changing.  Yes, we will still need oil but not to any extent the way we have in the past.  Grow and adapt instead of whining.
1157 2018-12-18 22:18:11 Can somebody come to explore a market opportunity in Africa particularly Zimbabwe where oil not available and is a huge cost to the economy.
1158 2018-12-18 22:17:54 Drew oil will be around with growing demand for hundreds of years. Most of the developing world still doesn’t have access but want it. Try looking at all of the products that come from oil(6000 products). I bet you have lots of those products you hypocrite. #ScheerIn2019.
1159 2018-12-18 22:17:51 Corollary to this is also true: As long as CNY oil keeps gaining share, PBOC will have more & more power to control its own Balance of Payments & therefore Current Accout surplus, making a CNY BoP Crisis or debt crisis less likely as the contract gains more share.
1160 2018-12-18 22:17:50 Drew did you tell those girls that if they want to be teachers or nurses that those professions are not valued and they should all have dreams to work in oil and gas?
1161 2018-12-18 22:17:41 Under water phone bawo.


Children ehn. You saw those ones that painted their dad's car with oil?

Zuzu and her brother can team up to do that
1162 2018-12-18 22:17:40 Ok oil being spilled in the forest swamp REALLY BAD. 
Oil being wasted in Arabia thanks to Europe’s anti oil initiative. ....
1163 2018-12-18 22:17:35 Can you further explain how you believe the CB's use oil as the new ZIRP? thanks in advance
1164 2018-12-18 22:17:32 Who do cheap oil changes
1165 2018-12-18 22:17:30 Im sure her lying snake oil salesman father will give her a job.
1166 2018-12-18 22:17:18 My hair loves black castor oil
1167 2018-12-18 22:17:14 No red state Texas oil president for me. Beto can stuff it.
1168 2018-12-18 22:17:06 My attention span is too short for instant oil changes
1169 2018-12-18 22:16:57 Fuckin oil gettin hit bad.
1170 2018-12-18 22:16:57 bet his nanny still creams his bum with with zinc and castor oil cream
1171 2018-12-18 22:16:50 It is even wrong to compare PH to Benin. Please also check the number of international oil companies that have Benin as a base they do in PH. PH has all it takes to be a mega city. As we speak the rate of kidnapping is off the roof.
1172 2018-12-18 22:16:46 Went to buy some crisps in @marksandspencer. Ms8 requested her favourite flavour:  black truffle and olive oil. What monster have we created?
1173 2018-12-18 22:16:44 How do you know Trudeau hates the Alberta oil & gas industry? He appointed Sohi as the Minister. When you put your weakest, most ineffective, under performing MP in charge of a Department you do that for a reason. And the reason is NOT to get results. #PnPcbc @PnPCBC
1174 2018-12-18 22:16:40 War mongers. Religion of peace my soft bumbum.
1175 2018-12-18 22:16:32 As well, Irving oil bringing billions of oil from Saudi, which is good for you? You are ok with that? We are far from spoiled here, we work our ass off every day for what we have. We don't get transfer payments that go unappreciated
1176 2018-12-18 22:16:29 30th March I assume. Although on the mainland we do have heavy reliance on oil based energy generation and provide oil domestically (Scotland) and import from Norway. Not sure if the Norway deal is underpinned by EU linked treaty or bilateral. Possible oil import will continue.
1177 2018-12-18 22:16:26 SCREAMS I TURNED MY CAR IN AT 9AM TO GET AN /OIL CHANGE/ AND A CAR FILTER CHANGED ITS 2:15!!!!!!!!!! I STILL DONT HAVE MY CAR!! so i called them and they said "maybe in the next hour" EXCUSE ME WHAT
1178 2018-12-18 22:16:24 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
1179 2018-12-18 22:16:22 Like I stated. It doesn't matter where oil comes from. Since our cars still need oil, I'd rather have #Alberta oil.
By pass #Quebec
They get equalization money from the rest of #Canada so they shouldn't involved in making rules for the rest of #Canada
1180 2018-12-18 22:16:19 This is why, unlike the ECB, the Fed targets core inflation, and would tend to emphasize the stimulative impact on energy consumers, which despite the growth of oil producers, are still the larger part of the economy.
1181 2018-12-18 22:16:17 There’s an oil and vinegar store in the mall by me and oh god is it wonderful.
1182 2018-12-18 22:16:08 And we are running out of oil. Right? You cannot predict. I assume you foresaw the internet 40 years ago. Point made.
1183 2018-12-18 22:15:58 Cbd oil will get rid of that
1184 2018-12-18 22:15:46 Can you explain why you are providing financing to oil and gas exporters.  They still have no other way to export thier product, so you provide them with financing to continue not to be able to export products.  This is so effed up it is not even funny....
1185 2018-12-18 22:15:35 Sounds good, there's at least a million of us just over the border happy to continue trade with you - we've got whisky, oil, gas, quality beef, lamb, venison, salmon, barley, oats etc..  We just need to persuade Nicola that re-joining the EU is not really independence.
1186 2018-12-18 22:15:34 They like what big oil tells them to like. They let themselves be tools of destruction. And when they realize they are actually harming their grandchildren's future, they don't have the backbone to change, so they console themselves with booze and sex.

Yeah. Cowards.
1187 2018-12-18 22:15:32 I’m making French fries and I’m really holding back on throwing a cup of water on the pot with boiling oil .
1188 2018-12-18 22:15:14 Someone in my office has an essential oil diffuser on her desk and one day I’m going to smash it to bits the way John Belushi destroys the guitar in ANIMAL HOUSE.
1189 2018-12-18 22:15:02 Yep they take money.  But look at their policy proposals.  There's one party that's in the pocket of the oil industry... and it ain't the Ds.

I'm not arguing that Ds are perfect.  But they are certainly not equivalent to the Rs.

1191 2018-12-18 22:14:49 Part of my birthday wishlist is 3 A3 white canvases with oil pastel crayons or just normal art paint really. As long as I get to make some art next year
1192 2018-12-18 22:14:44 Sadly, what you've said is true. It's innovation, bid'a to open qira'a in masajid speaker loudly. But if it's azaan, I'm afraid that nincompoop should go hug high tension wire. Or should probably start with other sources of nuisance
1193 2018-12-18 22:14:36 Cassie couldn’t get the coconut oil out of the pot cause it was too solid, I told her to put the spoon in the microwave and she actually asked how long for and went to put it in 
1194 2018-12-18 22:14:35 I just know that Scotland’s ports and harbours have served everything from shipbuilding, oil platform headgear, , jute ferries - I know som are deep and some not deep enough. Dundee is a fantastic port on the protected Firth of Tay. 
But I get your point.
1195 2018-12-18 22:14:34 Many laughed at relevance of the CNY oil contract earlier this year.  They're probably not laughing anymore.  Key to USD oil prices is becoming CNY/USD cross-rate, right before our eyes.  If US wants to save its shale sector fr collapse, it will have to deval USD v. CNY, soon.
1196 2018-12-18 22:14:33 Oil prices are a bit like petrol  pumps increases are passed on straight away and reductions lag.

On stocks drops are applied instantly and increases usually see stocks lagging behind playing catch up.

With that in mind better to await direction downtrend is over surely? 
1197 2018-12-18 22:14:29 Have a look at #RRE - cheapest oil out there. I say oily but has 50% gas and 25% oil hedged at $68! Profit £72m at current oil prices and cap is around £76.8m also have cash of around £53m
1198 2018-12-18 22:14:24 just squeaky.. Like it needs a wee oil or something!
1199 2018-12-18 22:14:18 Conversation between me and papa

P: actually, there was a stick of butter in there too
Me: ...
P: this is very rich in oil
Me: damn fracking

1200 2018-12-18 22:14:17 Are u confused lmao go look at any oil junior or midcap they are trading at valuations never seen in history. When oil was $28 in 2016 stocks were higher. You are clueless
1201 2018-12-18 22:14:16 Might be time to reconsider coconut oil Jack! LDL HDL 
1202 2018-12-18 22:14:14 Yea I've heard that before, but there's a lot that doesn't quite make sense with oil right now. Hard to explain in a tweet.
1203 2018-12-18 22:14:07 More good news! Can you feel the shift? The clean energy revolution is actually happening. At long last! Trump circles the drain. Big Oil is going down. 2019 is going to rock. Thank you!!!@ClimateReality!!!
1204 2018-12-18 22:14:04 I follow minor parties & a lot of rural people There is a small outcry but I would like & thought it should be louder Nationals don’t seem to be doing much in rural seats especially safe seats
A squeaky wheel gets the oil & a swinging seat gets the funding
1205 2018-12-18 22:14:02 Alberta is going to get the oil to market with out you notley.
1206 2018-12-18 22:13:59 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
1207 2018-12-18 22:13:59 I think it’s just air bubbles and the oil sugaring up
1208 2018-12-18 22:13:53 Hey there! We use soy bean oil in our friers. Hope to see you soon!
1209 2018-12-18 22:13:50 A snake oil salesman will fleece a town until his bogus claims catch up to him. Then he sells out at bargain prices, promises last minute miracles and slips out under cover of darkness like the Thief in the night he is.

1218 2018-12-18 22:13:18 They don’t control the price of oil. The do produce policies that affect the movement of oil. Dippers and Liberals hate oil and prosperity!
1219 2018-12-18 22:13:09 I farted so badly I had to make a scented candle out of a tealight and cranberry mandarin oil. 

She wasn't impressed by the ingenuity nor the fart.

1221 2018-12-18 22:12:52 Day 18 of my challenge to find Mince Pies that have a #positive impact on the planet. A reflection on price: The cheaper the product, the more preservatives, sugar and unsustainable palm oil is used. Who is making a profit? And who is paying the real price for the cheap product?
1222 2018-12-18 22:12:52 So you continue to consume oil but look down on the producers?
1223 2018-12-18 22:12:46 Having gone thru the oil boycotts of the 70's, this is sweet news indeed.
1224 2018-12-18 22:12:27 Dude just try the CBD oil. It literally helps with pain, anxiety & depression
1225 2018-12-18 22:12:25 We’re there for corporate oil interests and Israel is a great launching point.
1226 2018-12-18 22:12:23 Be real. Oil is down 8% and you talking about tax selling. No one is taking these free money before January rally? Strange!
1227 2018-12-18 22:12:16 Bissalaaam
1228 2018-12-18 22:12:06 Aí é que está... qual o custo médio de produção hoje? Shale e OPEP? O resto não conta... qual a relação de troca oil x T Bond  10 anos?
1229 2018-12-18 22:11:58 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like #oil & gas, rigging, lifting, mining, aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
1230 2018-12-18 22:11:57 How about some balsamic and a little oil for dipping? :)
1231 2018-12-18 22:11:30 Yes. And how's Russia doing these days? Well? Not needing to invade other countries for oil or gas? Not sending out evil tweets to influence elections, or hiring actors to start riots?
Oh yes, I remember the Berlin Wall.
1232 2018-12-18 22:11:27 Be careful what you ask for @realDonaldTrump regarding oil prices.
1233 2018-12-18 22:11:26 Oil and gas industry in Canada
1234 2018-12-18 22:11:23 Oil spill, 35000 liters or 350 hectoliters, how is it measured, and where do the workers put the "stuff", oil, detergents and other products after the clean up?
1235 2018-12-18 22:11:20 Just off the top of my head:

1. Can tha put wood int t’oil?
2. ‘As tha got owt moist?
3. ‘Ow bloody much?!

And finally, Are We All Still Wednesday?

1238 2018-12-18 22:11:04 Let's see if the oil industry workers get bought off to stay quiet,or Trudeau really gets hammered for still doing nothing but wasting more tax payers dollars.Worst PM in history,let by the nose by the worst party leadership in history.
1239 2018-12-18 22:11:02 How do you mean by getting along with others? I believe you mean doing what they say is best, that is all I hear from your response. How about a conversation instead of a lecture. I have a successful business not related to the oil industry, but I see the hurting people
1240 2018-12-18 22:11:00 I actually hate the taste of Olive Oil. It’s a new development. Idk where it came from. It’s just so strong??? On a salad cool but to fry an egg or make food? I can’t do it anymore.
1241 2018-12-18 22:10:57 Guess I should just cooked dinner... truffle oil mac & cheese and fried salmon it is
1242 2018-12-18 22:10:52 Its like the conversation I had w/ the heating oil company when 1st month was trading $1 cheaper for over 6 months than what they were charging me ...
1243 2018-12-18 22:10:33 I have a mixture of coconut oil and teatree that I rub on my nose to help with that bc I'm always a sneezy mess. Rose ointment is also a life saver!

But you only live once so I just say what comes out my mouth
1250 2018-12-18 22:10:05 Dam, Im always changing the oil. Im being ripped off, lol. who knew?
1251 2018-12-18 22:10:02 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
1252 2018-12-18 22:09:59 ang mahal lang ng oil essentials. hindi kasi pwedeng basta basta na oil eh. dapat yung pangtubig talaga. ganon hahaha walang LED light nga lang, ayoko din kasi mas maaksaya sa kuryente tsaka may ilaw naman sa bahay, kailangan ko yung bango hahhaahhahahaha
1253 2018-12-18 22:09:59 Oil prices heading south, ruble usually follows
1254 2018-12-18 22:09:59 Sadly, the same people that are ramming this global climate change down our throats are the same people that spent the last century monopolizing the oil industry....
1255 2018-12-18 22:09:45 I've heard that oil companies are getting hammered because there's way to high of a supply. Supposedly OPEC and Russia both agreed to reduce the amount of oil they barrel a day though.
1256 2018-12-18 22:09:44 y’all pray this cbd oil starts working on my back fr fr i’m tiredttttt
1257 2018-12-18 22:09:41 And when you speak #canada hurts!! So shut up and build pipelines to get oil flowing east and west.
1258 2018-12-18 22:09:41 Same I’m drinking castor oil tn fuck it
1259 2018-12-18 22:09:39 E você HENRIQUE está vendendo oil agora?
1260 2018-12-18 22:09:37 Thanks Dom! It’s a weird oil market...
1261 2018-12-18 22:09:31 Wait till I tell her she is going to have some #harristweed back bench seat covers  and a wax oil under her belly
1262 2018-12-18 22:09:22 Took me all of 5 minutes of being in the car until I realized I forgot to pack something at the last minute. 

RIP beard oil
You will be missed.
1263 2018-12-18 22:09:16 It’s not inaccurate. You are only deciding that based on a tiny tiny scale. Now imagine if 2b cars were all using batteries? It changes everything. It’s the difference between a cup of oil being spilled into the ocean and megatons of oil being spilled into the ocean.
1264 2018-12-18 22:09:14 What about vehicle and other use of gas and oil?
1265 2018-12-18 22:09:01 I don’t think an OPEC cut of 10MMbpd would even put a floor under #oil right now. This is just crazy.
1266 2018-12-18 22:08:55 Claire was awake, and wishing she had held Bryce just a little tighter so her girlfriend, and current source of her warmth, wouldn't have moved. Just a few hours ago, the woman of steel had to swim below the surface of deep Arctic waters to prevent an oil spill from becoming a
1267 2018-12-18 22:08:54 Good point. In any way, let's hope that a party who knows that Alberta needs to diversify its economy and energy sources takes power next year so we can get off the crazy roller coaster ride the free market racketeers in the oil and gas industry strapped us onto.
1268 2018-12-18 22:08:53 They’ve recently found a massive new oil field in the North Sea. I don’t know, but I guess that Scotland’s EEZ would have a lot more of it than England’s. Breaking up the Union would be great for Scotland’s small 5m population.
1269 2018-12-18 22:08:50 Just looking at Carl, reveals one thing. He’s saturated with soy oil, making him a soyboy. I mean, look at that thing,  #idiot

1272 2018-12-18 22:08:40 & what were net global government receipts from oil & gas?

1274 2018-12-18 22:08:31 Went to get an oil change, left with 10 lbs of dog hair  that’s the best customer service from a mechanic ever #3Huskies
1275 2018-12-18 22:08:27 big love to whoever got me the oil diffuser off my wishlist  thanks so much i love it!
1276 2018-12-18 22:08:26 So true that’s why I sleep with a oil diffuser and use oils for this time around 
1277 2018-12-18 22:08:21 We are ready for them, the war go start tomorrow
1278 2018-12-18 22:08:17 ...that makes CBD oil sound a hell of a lot worse...
1279 2018-12-18 22:08:15 The real question is, could we handle a recession with oil prices going lower? I don’t see that going well for us. The only thing Sterling is the spoon which has been permanently lodged in the PMs mouth since he was born.
1280 2018-12-18 22:08:09 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
1281 2018-12-18 22:07:56 THATS NOT AN OPTION also I dont have oil paints XD Thats for when we have a house and an easel
1282 2018-12-18 22:07:52 New Oil Order in play. Nations hedging their bets for a non petrodollar world. Need new controls/allies on production and defense just in case.
1283 2018-12-18 22:07:49 Yet again I say STOP THE PAYMENTS NOW let them struggle with the loss of all that oil money and then see....
1284 2018-12-18 22:07:46 When we finally sell the Saudis enough US assets like agricultural land, refineries, pipelines, shale leases, technology (Twitter) and car manufacturing, they won't give a shit what the price of oil is, so long as we can't afford to produce it.
1285 2018-12-18 22:07:43 cantu leave in conditioning cream, extra dark castor oil & carols daughter hair pomade
1286 2018-12-18 22:07:42 That’s not how it works silly. Gas prices don’t come down when oil does, no love for the consumer.
1287 2018-12-18 22:07:29 Assassinated
1288 2018-12-18 22:07:26 And Quebec still has a couple of pipelines on hot standby from Portland that have transported 5 Billion barrels of oil to Montreal-Est. Im positive if something physical or political would happen to line 9 before it gets to Quebec, Portland would be activated within hours.
1289 2018-12-18 22:07:18 this is just a bullshit ploy so Trudeau looks like he is doing something.... if he really was serious he would BLOCK SAUDI OIL ....for him to even suggest he would end this contract is just for public optics
1290 2018-12-18 22:07:09 All my 21 years of living I never knew olive oil lay yo hair down like this lmaaao
1291 2018-12-18 22:07:08 Please @iniubs deserves this N50,000. She just started a perfume oil business and this would go a long way in boosting her business. Thank you.
1292 2018-12-18 22:07:02 If corn oil is made from corn, and olive oil is made from olives,  is baby oil made from babies?
1293 2018-12-18 22:07:01 I mean, he IS dressed like a 21st century snake oil/tonic salesman
1294 2018-12-18 22:06:58 Vacume/mop floor. Lemon oil around base boards and bed frame. Few drops of lemon oil on damp cloth and wipe. Lasts up to 3 months and works for ants and spiders too. If Buddy likes bed, just do boards.
1295 2018-12-18 22:06:57 Let me see
1296 2018-12-18 22:06:51 maybe hemp seed oil snapped.... skincare twitter may have made some points
1297 2018-12-18 22:06:48 or the FED and Oil prices.
1298 2018-12-18 22:06:42 But all the energy still come from fossil fuels don’t they? I don’t ignore the positive Tesla has done. But wouldn’t it be amazing if our major energy production centers used hydrogen instead of oil or coal? I’m not just talking about cars.
1299 2018-12-18 22:06:28 Oh I love hearing them  They really like peanuts a lot, black oil sunflower seeds and suet that I've seen so far. They LOVE the whole peanuts. I tossed a handful in the yard and they were gone in minutes.
1300 2018-12-18 22:06:21 Just stop buying their oil
1301 2018-12-18 22:06:15 some CBD Oil on the tongue

1305 2018-12-18 22:05:48 Why is Saudi oil exempt from the carbon tax scam?
1306 2018-12-18 22:05:47 Didn’t know Algeria is in Asia ahaha for the cheek turkey is in Asia! Absolute idiot! Stick to naked wrestling in oil!
1307 2018-12-18 22:05:46 1973 to 2003...  hmmm - an interesting timeframe...  
and renewables got more than oil & gas,,,, to produce what % of the power over that time period?  (sounds like questionable vfm)

& since 2003??

What actual subsidies?
1308 2018-12-18 22:05:39 Hey @VassyKapelos, ask @SohiAmarjeet how many jobs the oil companies will create with this $1.6 billion taxpayer give-away.

Or will they, as usual, pocket the cash and continue laying off Canadians?   #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #ableg
1309 2018-12-18 22:05:27 The Trump administration wants to destroy VA Healthcare so veterans will be forced to use private healthcare.  Just like Zinke was there to destroy public lands for the oil and coal industries.
1310 2018-12-18 22:05:17 I did try very hard. I checked every news feed. Did it occur to you that the feds consulted with oil industry executives?
1311 2018-12-18 22:05:16 Is this a new National Energy Program or just a one time welfare payment to the oil elites? Might quiet the oil lobby hysteria for a few weeks.
1312 2018-12-18 22:05:03 $523,150 raised from "oil and gas" industries. Lifetime donations that are "small individual contributions" = $180,343, or 2.45% of his money raised. PACs/large individual contributions = over $3,000,000 each.
1313 2018-12-18 22:04:53 Sad how his legacy along with Obama's is to kill innocent children. The US is known now for its evil practices. All in the name of money power geranium oil etc. The Irish I'm sure are proud as well.
1314 2018-12-18 22:04:49 Like today I found $100 in the pep boys parking lot (so sorry to whoever lost it) and I just got a free oil change I’m so happy god is good !!!
1315 2018-12-18 22:04:48 I keep hearing the libs tell us we need to invest in clean energy. What does this mean exactly? The only energy source that is a contender to replace oil, gas and coal is nuclear. And we all know how eco-terrorists feel about that option. Alberta should build nuclear power plants
1316 2018-12-18 22:04:29 Feel like with an oil funnel you can make a DIY version
1317 2018-12-18 22:04:26 Olive oil and garlic for me. I've from others that it's an aphrodisiac.
1318 2018-12-18 22:03:56 I'll be the first to say we need to diversify and wean ourselves off of oil eventually, but right now we need revenue one way or another.
1319 2018-12-18 22:03:48 They call that a protest? It looks like someone unloaded a clown car. How many people were at Calgary’s pro oil protest yesterday? 2000-3000?
1320 2018-12-18 22:03:42 If I got a dollar for every oil burn and hot water spilling on my hand, I'd have $8
1321 2018-12-18 22:03:41 Canada is the biggest supplier of US energy, dealing with the saudies isn't about oil, it's about billions for the weapons manufacturers. The US is still the biggest arms dealer in the world, gotta keep the machine fed.
1322 2018-12-18 22:03:36 thankful that twitter reminded me to get an oil change bc my parents sure didn’t!! isn’t that their job???
1323 2018-12-18 22:03:36 One to dig out eveytime we get told oil is running out. Been telling us that for over 30 years

This morning You reported oil down 7% but my app says Natural Gas was up 8.5%! No mention? Waz happening?

1328 2018-12-18 22:02:52 I do not know, do you know where oil as it is traded today lands on Exter's pyramid?
1329 2018-12-18 22:02:38 Lots of wheelers and dealers! It's hard to keep them all straight. Cyprus is also known for its money laundering. Ole Wilbur Ross has his hand in everything, including aluminum and steel. Follow the money, oil, banks, law firms, oligarchs, etc.
1330 2018-12-18 22:02:33 I love that vlog  next time make them put oil on them 
1331 2018-12-18 22:02:29 @knee_sun18 is the only person I would want to oil me up
1332 2018-12-18 22:02:25 so apparently if you have oily skin your own oil can irritate your skin and make it red so today I applied translucent powder after my moisturizer and my skin is actually not red and blotchy for once
1333 2018-12-18 22:02:10 Is Trump weakening America by selling off our strategic oil reserves? 

Could this create more problems going forward?
Is anyone watching this?

1335 2018-12-18 22:02:06 Snake oil. Hmmm, nah, that’s her hubby’s fragrance.
1336 2018-12-18 22:02:03 Of course they want to squash community renewables. Why would Tories want plebs to be free? Oil and gas ties the little people to Govt, solar frees us.
1337 2018-12-18 22:02:02 SOOO TRUE!  But besides selling the country ( our monuments and beautiful lands Two big oil). He is selling OUT OUR COUNTRY.
1338 2018-12-18 22:01:59 Because the hair-brained neoconservatives who invaded Iraq never had a feasible long term plan.  Rumsfeld said they would welcome us with flowers and the war would pay for itself from the oil revenues.  Never predicted Iraqi people would be unhappy with US overlords.

1348 2018-12-18 22:01:19 I apologise in advance didn’t realise changing my profile pic from predominately Oil would have such an impact on the price action today .

We are where we are some will panic first thing & MMs will mark stocks down but there’s always a dead cat bounce to salvage more.

1360 2018-12-18 22:00:23 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
1361 2018-12-18 22:00:23 So at the end, the US shale guys are saving the world ( lower natgas prices all over the world= decreasing coal consumption and polution,  lower oil prices = crazy countries not having enough money to do the stupid things and low GDP countries growing fastly ).
1362 2018-12-18 22:00:20 I’ll call GQ now. @knee_sun18 got oil boy duties though. 
1363 2018-12-18 22:00:20 うそつき。
1364 2018-12-18 22:00:17 December 18, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1367 2018-12-18 22:00:15 If it helps those small operators diversify into the energies of the future then it is what Alberta needs. Albertans are in denial. Getting more of their oil to markets is not going to happen. No need for it before any new pipeline can help. Too much supply and declining demand.
1368 2018-12-18 22:00:08 We've got tens of thousands abandoned oil and gas wells that nobody is paying for. Who's gone to jail for that? A huge mine tailings spill in BC that never has been cleaned up and nobody is paying with $ or jail time. So, no, what you are saying is blatantly untrue.
1369 2018-12-18 22:00:02 Ummm maybe the price of oil? Just a guess. 
1370 2018-12-18 21:59:57 I’ll only feel like it a success when I can commission dumb oil paintings of my friends and I.
1371 2018-12-18 21:59:45 He's more than capable of putting his comments into context himself, and he chooses not to. He could say increasing oil production is not something of which he's now proud. Seeking credit from all sides - while the planet burns.
1372 2018-12-18 21:59:34 Depending on the material being cut, oil or WD-40 can help. 
1373 2018-12-18 21:59:27 Then when no one at the AER, @OilGasCanada or @YourAlberta does anything to help folks you gotta go to court. Then they screw you by delay and barrier as in the Jessica Ernst case. They basically bankrupt you. The government is so in the pockets of the oil industry at all levels.

Don’t let @driveandshine service your vehicle !! 

These crooks stripped my oil pan bolt and are tryna make me pay for their mistake!!! 

I will gladly never be giving them my business ever again!
1376 2018-12-18 21:59:19 Well played. I still like the fundamentals in oil even if the funds are de-leveraging right now.
1377 2018-12-18 21:59:15 We just got some new *Silver Hawk - Summit - Hood Oil*

1380 2018-12-18 21:58:53 Gas in Mi today under 2.00 per gallon! Pumping oil line crazy! How much did Odummy cost us by not pumping! Do you see any environmental issues yet? Millions being saved just like tax cut but bigger! @POTUS @IngrahamAngle Thanks POTUS
1381 2018-12-18 21:58:40 Does anyone know how to clean painted walls with oil stains...... i tried cleaning and only made it worse and scared about my landlord and how much they’ll charge me once they see the shit i did to their newly painted walls lmao
1382 2018-12-18 21:58:40 I'd read that LA County has more oil than all of Alaska, which seems INSANE if true
1383 2018-12-18 21:58:31 the bottles are so classy that it could be beard oil ^^
1384 2018-12-18 21:58:30 US now worlds no 1 producer of oil... he’s doing a fine job. Wish he was here running this country.

1392 2018-12-18 21:57:42 What about plastics? Great for us to stop burning hydrocarbons, but the First World uses 20x as much plastic per capital per year as China or India - reducing emissions vs using metal or glass. Plastics growth will drive oil demand growth once fuel use yapers.
1393 2018-12-18 21:57:33 *twitter name is OIL, OIL is 5th*
1394 2018-12-18 21:57:14 Everybody is NOT your assignment, ask GOD before you waste your Oil.

1396 2018-12-18 21:57:06 yes. usa gets involved in other countries business directly(invade)or indirectly(behind civil wars, dictatorships, rebels=terrorists)4 their economic interests/power. iraq oil, afganistan drugs, yugoslavia, syria cs they were under russian influence. then claim russia is bad lol
1397 2018-12-18 21:57:06 Me nd Fila... Oil nd Water.. U already know. 
1398 2018-12-18 21:57:02 Trudeau and Butts' plan from the beginning was to completely shut down western Canada's oil and gas industry.  Their evil plan is slowly working, and we need to toss these evil eco terrorists from office while we still have a democratic nation.
1399 2018-12-18 21:56:56 As nice as watercolor painting is I find oil painting to be more satisfying. 
1400 2018-12-18 21:56:50 I’ve been at @AAAauto for over 3 hours to get my mom’s car’s oil changed and have 4 tires mounted, balanced, and installed. Unreal.
1401 2018-12-18 21:56:44 Guys does bio oil work or is it a myth ?

1404 2018-12-18 21:56:36 I leaned back in my chair. I then told the waiter to bring another bottle of the wine that was on the table. He had placed some hot bread sticks with seasoned olive oil on the table for us to eat when he had come to the table. He poured the rest of the wine equally into our glass
1405 2018-12-18 21:56:36 Thank you CBD oil, thank you 
1406 2018-12-18 21:56:36 The oil, please! :-)

1409 2018-12-18 21:56:12 Oh, also, the broccoli leaves got chopped up and added to my salad for lunch. I think they taste great, no more bitter than kale and add a nice bulk and density to the salad, which also included chard, arugula, spinach, feta, walnuts, tomato, avocado, olive oil and balsamic.
1410 2018-12-18 21:56:09 No wonder ppl are always yells girls to get their oil change, this shit is a hassle
1411 2018-12-18 21:56:06 You’re deluded if you believe that Scotland could survive on its own . It simply doesn’t have the recourses . Oil is running out which leaves whiskey as Scotlands largest exporter. Plus Scotland is currently subsidised by England, a fact whether you like it or not.
1412 2018-12-18 21:55:39 You can not store the power for any long term!   Take the money spent on that junk and buy stock piles of oil while it's cheap.
1413 2018-12-18 21:55:37 I thought that....no his probably with Ting Tong Macadandy.
1414 2018-12-18 21:55:35 She would cook him with chickens feet!
1415 2018-12-18 21:55:27 “Lead us, don’t leave us”
“Cherished union”
But under their breath its “how much longer do we have to put up with the sweaties? Surely the oil must have almost run out by now...”
1416 2018-12-18 21:55:27 All of those countries have quite different economies though 

Money from oil? (Norway) Not being in the EU's Common Fisheries Policy? Compulsory military service? Higher suicide rates than the UK? Being outside the EU (Iceland and Norway)? Pay upfront to see a doctor? (Sweden)
1417 2018-12-18 21:55:19 Yes, we need to fully eliminate oil subsidies. I was gently pushing the discussion in that direction. The claim we fully have to fund healthcare from the start ignores that we run a massive deficit for military adventures.
1418 2018-12-18 21:55:14 True! Where to get that money from though? Oil is a natural resource!
1419 2018-12-18 21:55:13 (equity, loans, etc)  and suddenlty oil sector is going to be crazy profitable for everyone invovled. But IMHO, thats not going to happen, eg. natgas shale funding and long term profitability (-50 to -80 bilions burned in the past few years) in this sector
1420 2018-12-18 21:55:13 YES! He has to be hiding something bigger. He could sweat out lying about Kislyak. But I wonder if the Russians offered incentives to kill sanctions and get deals like Rosneft Oil off the ground. Honestly believe they all thought they were above the law.

1422 2018-12-18 21:55:08 If this happens again I’ve found that putting canola or olive oil in your ear works a treat. It breaks down the wax that’s holding the water in.
1423 2018-12-18 21:55:04 Coming up on @CTV_PowerPlay, Alberta premier @RachelNotley on the oil industry help: @SolomonFriedman on impaired driving changes; @ThomasMulcair on Quebec politics 2018; @_MicheleAustin on Twitter highlights and @TondaMacC and @RobertFife grade the ministers.
1424 2018-12-18 21:55:02 @drmarkhyman  I just watched a video about MCT oil and its effects on the body. I wanted to say you are absolutely correct. In 4 months I’ve lost over 100 pounds, 8 inches off my waist with little to no exercise other than normal work routine. Increased clarity and better sleep.
1425 2018-12-18 21:54:59 Thank you but unionized oil workers namely 488 need a fair piece of the work that’s seems to be more controlled by non union uncertified trades persons that cut corners by not always hiring ticketed trades persons and not following the same rules of safety’ n
1426 2018-12-18 21:54:59 Literally same. Castor oil didn’t do much for me either but it helps with some people. But yeah iron is the way to go, I would say my hair loss has improved a bit  (also take iron on an empty stomach with vit C for better absorption )
1427 2018-12-18 21:54:54 If Trudeau wanted this built he would of challenged the court decision last August. Since even he has said pipelines are national interest he should of used not with standing Clause. THAT is exactly what it's there for. People will not like result of when oil and gas crumble!
1428 2018-12-18 21:54:53 Don't mention Thai friends Jungerns might be watching lol.
1429 2018-12-18 21:54:51 clove oil is great for tooth pain.
1430 2018-12-18 21:54:50 Is the oil chart adjusted for the rolls?
1431 2018-12-18 21:54:45 We not only need to limit oil (gas & coal) production to avoid the worst calamities of climate change, we need to 100% replace them with clean renewable energy. It's burning of fossil fuels and agricultural practices that cause the warming. Check out NASA website on issue.
1432 2018-12-18 21:54:45 And even if those were granted as you say, that still doesn’t protect the market from the current surplus. Alberta oil would still be trading below cost, measures would still need to be taken.

1438 2018-12-18 21:53:51 Blame the oil companies for layoffs when they are going broke because they can't get their product to tide water. I think its you who needs to grow up. The west is just tired of being treated like an ATM by Quebec. They're ok with Saudi oil but not Alberta's. Hypocrites
1439 2018-12-18 21:53:48 bout to give myself an oil change everyone wish me luck

1444 2018-12-18 21:53:37 I think it was the lion that made me think that is was, in fact, beard oil. Idk why though xD
1445 2018-12-18 21:53:35 Yeah but I thought the oil and gas industry was profitable! Why is tax money being spent on it?
1446 2018-12-18 21:53:32 When are the Glazers stepping down? We need that oil money.
1447 2018-12-18 21:53:29 Tablespoon of mineral oil...check w/your physician 1rst.
1448 2018-12-18 21:53:24 What’s this fantasy we were sold on? The bitumen wont we shipped to the east coast. Conventional light oil would. Alberta makes more than just 1 product

1457 2018-12-18 21:52:35 I feel one of the factors impacting MLPs is credit and counterparty risk. They have deals with producers that are coming under more pressure with lower oil prices.
1458 2018-12-18 21:52:32 it is still amazing to me that there are *oil wells actively drilling oil* randomly in the middle of Los Angeles neighborhoods.
1459 2018-12-18 21:52:29 Oil and footjobs!!!!!! And @Madison420Ivy and @RachelStarrxxx  scenes and the return of @littlesexbuddha
1460 2018-12-18 21:52:22 He did take money from oil. No thanks the democrats start once again with a failure
1461 2018-12-18 21:52:17 it did.  Gold/oil ratio rose from 13 bbls/oz in Sep-14 to 30x by Jan-15, up 130% in 4 mths.
1462 2018-12-18 21:52:09 Try not to be "most" humans.  Find yourself a whole foods or a store that sell juicy Ribeyes or porterhouses, grass fed if you prefer, cook to medium rare, add some "real" butter or in non-refined coconut oil, depending on your height and weight 16-32oz portion should suffice.
1463 2018-12-18 21:52:04 Boy are you generous. I believe Carter knew exactly what the consequences were. He just couldn't abide a flourishing capitalist country in the middle east and put the screws to the oil industry at the same time.
1464 2018-12-18 21:52:03 Not just TS/SCI. Im just a brit PR guy that advised a few sovereign states and national oil firms. I got chapter and verse on FARA and what happens if you dont register. Maybe its true what they say about DIA?
1465 2018-12-18 21:51:57 Yes - does that include Scots who are MPs representing English constituencies? Your calibre Of politician is way beneath us-  I’m sure you’ll all battle on .. soldier on! We just take the oil etc.. you still have jellied eels 
1466 2018-12-18 21:51:53 Little wonder that when Jesus commissioned them to go do work for the kingdom, He told them to heal the sick, open blind eyes, set captives free and perform signs and wonders. So if in your worship, no signs, no wonders, no miracles, then that worship is so dry. It lacks oil!
1467 2018-12-18 21:51:50 Its cause they are the real citizens our nation is owned and controlled and oil rich nations. You are subject to their rules not the other way around.
1468 2018-12-18 21:51:44 Oil is just amazing.
1469 2018-12-18 21:51:41 Got the lot here for Christmas ...I have a little saying ..no one is listening ....I'll tell you Sean....

Brandy makes you randy,
Whiskey makes you frisky and
Rum makes you ?
1470 2018-12-18 21:51:29 Pretty much AB’s sentiment. Trudeau likes our money and it ends there. Wonder how much he’d love oil sands if they were in QC. “Canada has the most ethical oil in the world” most likely.  Phoney as a $3 bill with his joker mugshot on it. Crap, he will probably do this now.
1471 2018-12-18 21:51:21 Another problem is, you cannot hold oil contracts for years. It has to be settled periodically.
1472 2018-12-18 21:51:20 I question the sincerity of those who claim Russian meddling in elections while overlooking the long held lobbying traditions of corporate, banking, gun, tobacco, oil, Pharma, healthcare, insurance, and anyone else who has a vested interest in shaping law to support their goals.
1473 2018-12-18 21:51:20 You don't even have to read very far into the article but you definitely have to open it... from the sub headline: "Oil Change USA took O’Rourke’s name off the list of political candidates who promised to reject fossil fuel donations over $200."
1474 2018-12-18 21:51:10 Markets would probably close (senior level BLK exec said US gov't talked to them about being prevented from selling in a crisis in 2014 per Jim Rickards), but I'm just talking about reality.  Do you know what % of oil production is uneconomic w/DXY at 160?  It's "yuge" :)
1475 2018-12-18 21:50:57 might happen faster if women start trying to get jobs on oil rigs, at sea, steel yards, machine shops, construction, etc...

those sound like fun jobs huh
1476 2018-12-18 21:50:56 Need to do this oil change after work
1477 2018-12-18 21:50:38 I’ll get you some cocaine gum and some snake oil
1478 2018-12-18 21:50:31 GURL. try castor oil on your scalp (pretty thick) and take iron pills. Iron deficiency can lead to hair problems :( I take them now too lol
1479 2018-12-18 21:50:27 A fact that obviously caused the entire economy to collapse when Saudi Arabia and the US deliberately dropped international oil prices, mainly to harm Iran.
1480 2018-12-18 21:50:19 My lil Kale salad is fire!!!! Lemon juice, salt, pepper, almonds, parmesan cheese and a little olive oil...WHEW CHILE
1481 2018-12-18 21:50:17 А потом опять поднимется.
1482 2018-12-18 21:50:17 We could wait until the next major climate catastrophe kills and makes homeless large numbers of people, or until the next pipeline leak or tanker crash to discuss what “ethical oil” could even possibly mean.
1483 2018-12-18 21:50:11 泣けますよね…
1484 2018-12-18 21:50:07 How important are oil changes? I just...don’t want one.

1491 2018-12-18 21:49:39 @BKBrianKelly snake oil salesmen
1492 2018-12-18 21:49:32 What happens to your car if you take a road trip when you’re 200+ miles overdue for an oil change?
1493 2018-12-18 21:49:32 Could you overlay the gold/oil ratio.  Looks like it goes north quickly after the Shangai gold exchange opened.
1494 2018-12-18 21:49:17 But it is also important to say that the reason for Venezuela's situation doesn't actually have anything to do with Chavez or Maduro, but with their capitalist, american puppet predecessors who based the entire economy on oil.
1495 2018-12-18 21:49:13 Why didn't Scotland vote to leave the uk when they had a chance , and with all the youngsters voting as well and you keeping your north Sea oil .
1496 2018-12-18 21:49:10 is it stingy if I email @JoMaloneLondon because I ordered perfume and it was meant to come with a free sample but I never got the free sample?  I wanted that bath oil

1498 2018-12-18 21:49:07 I well knew who Icke is but always surprised by the number of people that snake oil salesman takes in. Anti-semitism takes many forms. Agree with you!
1499 2018-12-18 21:49:03 Its the snake oil you believe in!!

1502 2018-12-18 21:48:44 That IMO is important...means that USD price impact of Angolan oil no longer solely about phys movements, demand/supply, cargoes, but also about CNY/USD cross rate.
1503 2018-12-18 21:48:32 Go. Tell. Her. Now. Do. Not. Wait.  Think of some other car like qualities of hers that you can tell her are great, like her bumper - how does that look?  Headlights?  Do they shine bright for you?  Does her engine purr?  Would you like to be the dip stick in her oil? Babny Jebus

1507 2018-12-18 21:48:23 what will fed do, oil lower, bad for oil states, good for consumer, more money in pocket even with no wage grwth
1508 2018-12-18 21:48:23 Hey Alberta! Maybe it’s time to get away from oil instead of begging Quebec to agree to a pipeline. We don’t want that shit overhere and would like to conserve Mother Nature. Lots of work in clean energy! #saynotopipelines #albertaoil #cleanenergy
1509 2018-12-18 21:48:20 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
1510 2018-12-18 21:48:16 The cost of refining bitumen oil is why the price is so low. There are very few places in the world that can refine it, and there is too much supply of it. Sorry Alberta, I understand why you want it, but it's bad business. You got sold a fantasy.
1511 2018-12-18 21:48:14 They truly aren't. It's sad. I'm very scared of a UCP gov't during an economy like this, which is why I was so thrilled the NDP came in. I know our NDP is still pro-pipeline but I feel strongly that they would do infinitely better things with oil money. We may never know though.
1512 2018-12-18 21:48:10 @montesolberg You had 10 yrs and accomplished zero. Now he has the nerve to complain about the Liberals help for Alberta. You did zero for the Oil pipe lines to tide water and nothing lasting for the workers. Please stay quiet.
1513 2018-12-18 21:47:52 In fairness, oil patch has benefitted from all of those things as well for decades...
1514 2018-12-18 21:47:49 it's difficult to understand what you mean by "divestment in indirect fossil fuel investment"...does that mean  @MonashUni is divesting from all fossil fuels--including oil and gas--as formulated in the ESG statement from 2016?
1515 2018-12-18 21:47:47  Not what you said when you followed me mate  I’m really struggling though, amazing what CBD oil does for you
1516 2018-12-18 21:47:46 “And we are well on our way” - that’s right, well on our way to climate disaster. History will judge you, @jimcarr_wpg and the greedy oil and pipeline corps harshly. You’re misrepresenting Canada’s true #NationalInterest and selling out our kids future. #TMX #Line3 #GreenNewDeal
1517 2018-12-18 21:47:31 “Shallots infused with orange juice, coriander seeds, saffron, cinnamon sticks, olive oil, and white sugar”.... hmm...
1518 2018-12-18 21:47:21 Is it still Virgin coconut oil if you use it as lu- 

Nvm. Forget I asked.

1528 2018-12-18 21:46:46 They were scum, but the US was wrong, too. If they really wanted to help the people they would have not so openly lusted for oil. It's the same old thing for the last 130 years- the Ugly American and-

1531 2018-12-18 21:46:30 @mtbarra I don't make millions of dollars a year- if I did, I wouldn't have bought a used Equinox. You do make that as the head of a company refusing to recall all of the vehicles with oil consumption issues. I'm not asking for anything unreasonable- I just want the mistake fixed

1535 2018-12-18 21:45:55 Anyone can see there is a difference between tweeting complaints about Israel exploiting mineral rights in the Golan, and linking the Syrian war to a Jewish-led oil conspiracy. 

Except you want to justify it.

Israel annexed Golan in ?83. It’s now in Israel.

Conspiracy kooks!
1536 2018-12-18 21:45:48 God help us if someone discovers oil on Pluto.
1537 2018-12-18 21:45:47 Wait, last week you were saying how great it is that the government is going to curtail oil production on certain companies? Now you're saying government should get out of the way? Also, what is "a clear path to work toward success? even mean? Massive tax cuts? Stuff like that?
1538 2018-12-18 21:45:46 Mix 2 cups jambalaya with 8 oz edimame. Mix in Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve over kale.
1539 2018-12-18 21:45:35 Sorry to hear you have these problems ,have you tried CBD OIL
1540 2018-12-18 21:45:30 The US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia are the 3 largest oil producers in the world right now. Trump’s climate denialism, his allegiance to these two countries, and the stacking of our govt with oil executives is all very connected.
1541 2018-12-18 21:45:29 OK, this is just a guess. Here goes. Oil is a dollar substitute for the world's biggest money speculators. When thery don't have enough dollars they liquidate oil to raise them. When they liquidate oil to raise dollars, their oil is worth less and they gotta raise more dollars.
1542 2018-12-18 21:45:23 You must talk to different oil industry reps then i do.
1543 2018-12-18 21:45:23 Assala Mualaikum Saudi Arab Everybody and Oil Unit Everybody Allah Hafiz Saudi Arabia Everybody and Mr Mr Salman
1544 2018-12-18 21:45:19 And then on Thanksgiving 2014, when everyone was sure Saudi would cut to preserve price, Saudi didn't.  Oil was down 10% that day.
1545 2018-12-18 21:45:10 Instead of bailing out oil now, Canada shouldn’t have went all in with dirty expensive oil that can’t be expected to compete in times of low price and demand in the first place.  Gravy trains aren’t meant to last forever
1546 2018-12-18 21:44:59 Oil was an expensive tactical Long in a book of equity shorts for me but at least we’ve got $1.50 gas at the pump to look forward to.  Cheers. #oilandgas #TuesdayTips

1555 2018-12-18 21:44:18 I would like to know more about Beto's political donors. I read he takes more campaign donations from big oil then anyone else except Ted Cruz. I like beto but if hes tied to big oil then that's where his loyalty lies.

1558 2018-12-18 21:44:11 PL can be bought with oil money, I have my troubles calling that 'competitive'. It's rather fake. Good bless Leipzig can't equal that here. PL used to be something back in the days, before they decided to sell-out completely. Also they were more successful back then on the pitch

peroxide, without the potential negative effects of using antibiotics long-term.
1561 2018-12-18 21:43:57 People only started taking it seriously when the price of crude oil doubled in price during the second gulf war. Hydrogen could be the cheapest thing imaginable, but it literally will explode if the tank gets too warm.

1627 2018-12-18 21:38:56 Some might take production offline due to that, oil will go up. Pendulum always swings both ways.

Nostra Terra's assets make money at much lower oil prices. The new Mesquite asset is exciting too! More on that in coming weeks.

1637 2018-12-18 21:37:49 Everything above is a lie.

The Truth is that AB was running deficits even when oil was over $100/barrel.

Alberta has an over-spending and under taxation problem that is the result of 43 uninterrupted years of AB PC Party mismanagement of the resource and the economy.

1645 2018-12-18 21:36:51 My thought is that #Trump intends to change focus of the news. If you don't raise the issue, Senate jackals calling for MBS to be deposed may quiet down & turn their attention to things like trying to defeat Trump's Wall, or Ocaso-Cortez's need for lavender oil & facials.

1657 2018-12-18 21:36:25 You’re right. Oil&Gas make up over 2/3 of Edmonton’s industrial infrastructure so hearing a few words of joint support from our council could be encouraging for a united front in supporting Alberta in these bad times when the loudest voices are foreign funded corrupt lobbyists.

Something I do when not at work, it includes grocery shopping, cutting my lawn, re-roofing my shed, changing the oil in my truck, pressure washing the driiveway...I call 'em chores actually and they take up a good portion of my "free time".
1758 2018-12-18 21:27:08 The dirty oil sector executives need their bonuses. It's a human right. Why shouldn't all Canadians chip in to pay for their bonuses?
1759 2018-12-18 21:27:07 Never. When the #Phillies finally fire Captain Coconut Oil, he will never manage in MLB again.
1760 2018-12-18 21:27:06 The beach and coconut oil.
1761 2018-12-18 21:26:59 While my heart broke at his story about his grandparents, I feel his anger should have been directed at Republicans, not Democrats. THAT'S who he should be calling out as cowards with their hands in big oil's pockets!! Pelosi hasn't been in control for a few years now. Just wait.
1762 2018-12-18 21:26:57 Then you can splash them in the face with your hot oil and make a run for it
1763 2018-12-18 21:26:55 Ahh this is the best next to someone who thought it was cannibal oil!!!
1764 2018-12-18 21:26:49 We would also want to match (or preferably exceed) increases in green tech exports as oil declines both for economic reasons AND for pushing global greening that’s more muscular than nation-level pacts and promises to reduce greenhouse gases
1765 2018-12-18 21:26:49 I think I need an oil change but idk

1768 2018-12-18 21:26:38 A combination of skilled and unskilled labour. The tweet talks about the people who dropped out of school bc they could make 6figures being a laborer in the oil sands. Those people tend to be be most upset about the fact that their standard of living was unsustainable
1769 2018-12-18 21:26:36 The Dow closed 83 points higher on Tuesday, but remains on track for its worst December since 1931. Oil prices plummeted 7% to their lowest close since August 2017. BU-75TU
1770 2018-12-18 21:26:27 Thank you Nicholas Soames for proving what we all knew, it was Scotlands oil you wanted and in showing your class and crass ignorance we can prepare for our freedom and a general,election to rid our country of people like you.

1783 2018-12-18 21:25:42 World stocks flat to lower: Europe-.8%; US flat. Yet another volatile day with markets disappointing investors. Even bargain hunters couldn’t drive the broad market higher as there is little confidence we’re near bottom. Interest-rates & oil prices sending message of slowdown.
1784 2018-12-18 21:25:42 Because they colluded with Trump to bring the oil price down
1785 2018-12-18 21:25:33 am I the only person who eats popcorn with olive oil and Parmesan cheese? or pasta with olive oil and Parmesan cheese? honestly. am I?
1786 2018-12-18 21:25:28 He’s from Texas. There are lots of oil fields and petroleum-related jobs in Texas. Not all oil executives are Republicans. Your view of this issue is almost as narrow as the ability of Progressives to be flexible with their agenda. Also, O’Rourke is not a Progressive.
1787 2018-12-18 21:25:28 Brent oil  hakkında ne diyorsun Prof,, 57$ civarında kısa vade düşüncen ne oluyor ?
1788 2018-12-18 21:25:19 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1789 2018-12-18 21:25:18 Learn some civilization first. When you running out of oil you will need it.
1790 2018-12-18 21:25:17 At least your were "acknowledge" and not forgotten altogether.. LOL
1791 2018-12-18 21:25:03 Good old @itv, talking about UK's #weatherfromhell this year but not mentioning the global #climatebreakdown responsible for the worsening conditions. 

Perhaps if we stopped drilling for and burning #NorthSea oil & gas, we could limit the effects of #climatechange.
1792 2018-12-18 21:24:59 I am a pro-life Christian conservative, but I don't understand why Christians support Trump & his followers, they are un American when they promote industrialization of public lands thru mining/oil drilling polluting & poisoning the earth.
1793 2018-12-18 21:24:55 I like my hoes clean. And applying some camellia oil keeps then going nicely through the winter.

1795 2018-12-18 21:24:42 U realize the Opportunity that come from the Oil Industry, yes the green energy is a great idea but it’s going take a little bit time to develop it. When you realize everything has a element of oil example shipment, food, clothing.
1796 2018-12-18 21:24:41 Why is it that as conscientious objectors we choose to condemn necessary & sustainable food production  ahead of all other carbon negative human endeavor??  
Planes, cars, concrete, plastic, palm oil, etc etc the list is endless.  
Food is not !

1806 2018-12-18 21:23:50 You really don't want me to tell you the process that is pizza hut, ESPECIALLY the way they make stuffed crust. They pre-roll the cheese into the crust, which was a frozen circle until it is put into a pan full of oil and sits. They then sauce it and cheese it and stick it in
1807 2018-12-18 21:23:48 No one. You should do it. When Levant was yammering on this, eastern Canada was still getting lots of oil from awful places. Now, things are different but you wouldn't know it from Tory talking points. WaPo?

1815 2018-12-18 21:23:12 Anyone else ever just add some olive oil and creole seasoning to corn and eat it out of the can? Or is it just me?
1816 2018-12-18 21:23:09 You went viral, I couldn’t think of anything 
I don’t know what to say about olive oil vinegar

1821 2018-12-18 21:22:39 Regardless, I wouldn’t put olive oil in a deviled egg. The olive oil taste would obliterate all the other flavors. You might say, the olive oil really DEVILED that egg!

1828 2018-12-18 21:22:01 The US is having the same issues. Bakken Oil on the US side is having similar differential issues. Alberta's myopic planning for investing in it's continuing prosperity is entirely at the hands of the party that dominated it's provincial politics for almost 40+ years. FACT.

1832 2018-12-18 21:21:46 Can we talk about Levant's greatest success: mainstreaming the racist and not-all-that-factual notion of Ethical Oil?

Who has written this longform?
1833 2018-12-18 21:21:43 There is also the question of scale. Childcare worker may look after 10-20 kids for 8 hours. An oil rig produces millions of $$ in oil 24/7. Work is not the same as production.

1838 2018-12-18 21:21:17 The co2 we breathe out is different cause our body produces clean co2 that plants can turn into oxygen but cause of the co2 that comes from oil contains tar plants cant turn it into oxygen cause the small holes on the leaves get blocked by the tar causing the tree to die

1842 2018-12-18 21:20:44 i need to oil my hair smh
1843 2018-12-18 21:20:42 You know..that is exactly the problem Alberta. Almost complete reliance on big oil to drive the economy is creating this downturn. For years Tory government’s have failed miserably to diversify the economy. Notely has done more in three years than Tories delivered in thirty!!!”

1848 2018-12-18 21:20:17 It wasn't ugly. Nenshi is a progressive who hates oil. He thought speaking French would endear him to the crowd. Guess he forgot, Quebec is not a fan of our oil. Just the cash. How he became mayor is beyond me. #CdnPoli #YYC

1850 2018-12-18 21:20:05 Why would you buy oil on the free market when Canadian oil is a third of the price?
1851 2018-12-18 21:19:58 spreading ill informed, poorly reasoned, & false conspiracy nonsense, is irresponsible & #dangerous when other poorly informed folks follow your ‘advice’ instead of actual knowledgeable experts. You, sir, are a #pox upon humanity, likely selling your own snake oil supplements  
1852 2018-12-18 21:19:57 Are you really a woman if you don’t get your oil changed when it’s 8,000 miles overdue
1853 2018-12-18 21:19:56 So stop buying oil from too.  Buy Canadian!
1854 2018-12-18 21:19:56 I understand that. But for years we created the Alberta Advantage of low taxes. Did not build a rainy day fund. The issue of the oil differential comes down to royalties and taxes. Low price per barrel is low royalties is less money in budget.  1/

1859 2018-12-18 21:19:19 Oil dropped 3.50. Down to $46.20/ barrel. Gas better be below $2 a gallon.
1860 2018-12-18 21:19:18 That’s good. I think you should hold your representative to why graduates from that community can’t get job even with good results. You can have all the oil as long as the government doesn’t take care of rise in population and creating jobs. My brother ego worse

1865 2018-12-18 21:18:32 Am I reading this right?..... oil and gas companies get access to loans while Bombardier gets free money?
1866 2018-12-18 21:18:26 Out of $uwt early before complete collapse.  Think oil will be a big play in 2019, but don't know how much lower it will go, before people figure out there's no oil glut.   First day I've seen with $labd running on it's own without help of Dow and Nas.

1870 2018-12-18 21:18:03 If you’ve ever owned an interest in an oil well or know people who do, you know this is exactly how things go. When the price of crude falls below a certain mark, the company stops pumping oil and your royalty checks stop. There’s plenty of oil left but $100 p bbl better than $40
1871 2018-12-18 21:17:50 The lower oil goes, the more unstable Saudi Arabia becomes.
1872 2018-12-18 21:17:48 I've worked in a few different industries including mining and oil and gas and with finance types. Every single one has its "never again" disaster. Every single one avoids a repeat through sheer luck. People who dare to say "but we are repeating old errors" are canned.

Russians agents will have fewer funds to manipulate US elections, instead of $400k, it will now be $40k.
Iran will cut back their aid to terror organizations by 80%.
1880 2018-12-18 21:17:10 @SmartLiberal 

The math moment :

Trump can't oppose both the rate hike and high oil prices. The oil is priced in USD, so a higher USD pushes the price lower.

Time for federal transfer payments to stop equal treatment for all not just Quebec.

I can build a 14th Century Manor Home without any modern tools, then fill it with Furniture I make, grace the walls with Realism Art, oil on canvas of course, while drinking homemade wine.

1892 2018-12-18 21:15:53 It's along with HYG weakness, leveraged firm deal weakness. Although HYG weakness is, for now, driven by leveraged oil.

1894 2018-12-18 21:15:41 #bbnaija bam beauty oil is on jumia, guys we are big like that world wide delivery,   baby girl is also a brand influencer of jumia are we not blessed? #BamTeddyToTheWorld #BamTeddy
1895 2018-12-18 21:15:39 Wasn't too crazy about it, coconut oil is so good for your skin, body, hair, and I'm allergic to coconuts so I can't use it and sad ;-;
1896 2018-12-18 21:15:36 The Oil and Gas Sector Companies don't need handouts. They need less regulation and red tape. Less interference from American Based Enviro Groups and pipeline infrastructure approved/built so we can access other mkts! It's that simple.
1897 2018-12-18 21:15:36 I think it is a bit more nefarious but it's never one thing. My belief remains that the CB's are using oil as the new ZIRP to offset their hawkish rhetoric/actions. This way they can defend the currency but not burn down the world (in theory). Not sure they can accomplish either.
1898 2018-12-18 21:15:34 As painful as it is for US oil cos. Melissa Francis makes a good point that the severe oil price drop puts even more pressure on Russia, Saudis, and Iran - not a bad trade-off at all!
1899 2018-12-18 21:15:24 Lower oil prices mean lower throughput on one end of pipeline, the end that's been growing, also processing economics impacted by lower NGL prices, but agree price action has little to do w/fundamentals...below $50/bbl clearly is outside the goldilocks range for investor interest

1906 2018-12-18 21:14:55 corn and beans are simply code words for oil and sugar... Those are the raw ingredients China needs to make goods for the United States.

1908 2018-12-18 21:14:45 I can’t believe I just paid $100 for this oil change
1909 2018-12-18 21:14:41 Personally I kind of feel like the tuition increases have many reasons, the main one imho is that college is like oil or food, it's an inelastic good: when prices go up consumption can't fall enough to compensate...
1910 2018-12-18 21:14:39 BAHAHAHA more along the lines of “pipeline, Kenney, UCP, oil, Trudeau, climate change, SJW” 
1911 2018-12-18 21:14:36 Thought putting body oil in my bath would be a good idea until I slipped and nearly snapped my neck

1917 2018-12-18 21:14:01 Even after the oil does eventually run out we have so much renewables that we’ll still have a big surplus of revenue/energy for the establishment to steal. So we have no choice but to dissolve the act of union.
1918 2018-12-18 21:14:00 How about moisturizer/day cream after that? A scrub should still leave the skin supple and not stripping the natural oil tho.

My skin is oily and break out easily. I am almost 42 and still get zits before my period. Lancôme is the only product that’s kind to my skin.
1919 2018-12-18 21:13:54 Dear #Alberta
I'm with #Alberta
If #Quebec is not in ... by-pass them. Our Cars still need oil and I'd rather buy #Alberta Oil than #Saudi oil

1920 2018-12-18 21:13:35 I can see that!
1921 2018-12-18 21:13:29 But keep subsidies for coal and oil?

1931 2018-12-18 21:12:39 While I’m getting my oil changed i literally had a pastor talk to me about getting into church, and i repeated over and over. We just all have different views. I support you 100% if you go to church and your beliefs, but don’t push it on me 
1932 2018-12-18 21:12:38 Cleanse the face with a spin brush & some Neutrogena Oil Cleanse, Apply Toner, apply a hydra gel face mask, then apply a moisturizer.
1933 2018-12-18 21:12:35 Shouldn’t lower oil prices result in higher volume throughout for pipelines? Higher volumes = more revenue. Price action in MLP stocks is nonsensical. What am I missing @MLPguy?
1934 2018-12-18 21:12:25 Trudeau and his globalists liberals are in the process of dismantling Canada. They started with the gender war, then the feminist agenda and then they moved on to the oil industry. They will destroy whatever they see blocks their road to their UN agenda and thatbis open borders!
1935 2018-12-18 21:12:23 - Olive oil -Lemon juice. (. Oregano . ) that’s it.
1936 2018-12-18 21:12:21 We are no longer dependent on foreign oil,  there's more jobs than ever  and the forced Obama care found unconstitutional  makes for a great month. Oh and by the way Obama is the Antichrist.
1937 2018-12-18 21:12:18 Just took my last final. 
Boutta lather my face in coconut oil. 
Not related just excited about both.

1939 2018-12-18 21:12:05 Right on the money Monte! It has been the intent of the Trudeau Liberals to cripple our oil and gas industry with some fantasy that we can transit from hydrocarbons to solar and hydro. It's also the same fantasy that taxes will change behaviour.
1940 2018-12-18 21:11:57 Something going on crude oil down over 7% #markets
1941 2018-12-18 21:11:57 Without having the slightest clue myself, what about china? Loans backed by equity, their real estate market, oil etc all don’t look good and some of the German companies with huge China exposure have been sounding rather negative lately. Or a combination of all of the above?
1942 2018-12-18 21:11:51 We love detail! Oil cover ready for clear. Imagine the damage and detail we could of done on a motorcycle Tank. 

Earliest artwork slots available from April 
1943 2018-12-18 21:11:51 Oil prices have also tanked...right after Khashoggi's murder , Trump was bragging about the low price of oil and tweeted that they could go lower...what does he know?
1944 2018-12-18 21:11:45 Is everything like the blue cheese and pastry SfV? Roasting done in veggie oil etc? If yes then that sounds great.

1946 2018-12-18 21:11:39 Saudis and Russians trying to close NA shale production by keeping it under 50. KSA no longer a swing producer and they did this 4 years ago. They're still profitable even with oil in low double digits.

1948 2018-12-18 21:11:29 Oil will drop down to where this and next month ? #natgas will follow it where this and next month ?
Those r the questions I'd like to find out...answers to..I know oil drop will decimate NG price...as happened b4 Bottom price? I don't know until I can confirm it....#Caution

1957 2018-12-18 21:10:30 and this is helps explain why oil prices are going down so low still despite supposedly OPEC slowing production?

S&P +0.01%, Nasdaq +0.4%.

But losers top winners 8/7 on NYSE, 3/2 on Nasdaq

1961 2018-12-18 21:10:01 Nope I’m saying that modern technology is superior.   If four baddies invade my home I will grab my AR with standard capacity magazine, red dot sight and 1,000 lumen light instead of a double bbl 12ga and an oil lamp.
1962 2018-12-18 21:09:57 $egl.to getting extra beating today. How low can it go? Is it their debt which is pushing down the stock little extra in the case of oil price goes under $40. Any advice there?

1966 2018-12-18 21:09:30 Yeah back when we first starting using oil and such, we have known for some time now though and learn more all the time.
1967 2018-12-18 21:09:29 The Saudis Just Can t Seem to Become the Saudi Arabia of Solar: Around the world, high oil prices… @environmentguru
1968 2018-12-18 21:09:22 Not much really. Was just separately making the point that oil is probably a long investment down here. Although, some think there is a correlation with natural gas and it is certainly debatable.
1969 2018-12-18 21:09:18 If I get up now I can get my oil changed and take off to SA for a day or two.... hmmm
1970 2018-12-18 21:09:07 You have been calling for oil to be 100 at year end and gold to be at 5000
You also called for dollar to be way down and foreign stocks up.

Wrong all around.
You have no shame

People who invest with you are doomed
1971 2018-12-18 21:09:06 It's awful--and I'm sure it's probably already been said, but...Castor Oil. *yuck* but it works.
1972 2018-12-18 21:09:04 Our son will eat sautéed green beans in olive oil and garlic salt! I recommend not overlooking seasonings and find something Luna likes!
1973 2018-12-18 21:09:01 Yep agree. Huge drop in rates. Not even talking about oil...
1974 2018-12-18 21:08:57 You nitwits better be a-thankin Jesus he gave you an oil well or two in Alberta. Because that is about all that you ridiculous embarrassing to Canada crybabies have going for you at this point. #cdnpoli #abpoli
1975 2018-12-18 21:08:53 After spending $2K on it? Push it off a cliff before.  And don’t be in it, if you do? 
That’s a lotta work. 
Sorry, to hear it. I can identify and you got me thinking about taking my car for a checkup. 
With the new oils and automobile you don’t change oil every six months.
1976 2018-12-18 21:08:49 Nooo remember to check ur oil every certain mileage
1977 2018-12-18 21:08:43 Agreed.  Caveat = wildcard few are talking about is CNY oil contract & CNY commodity pricing more broadly.  China's non-commodities goods trade surplus is ~$700B; if China can print CNY for commodity imports, China will not have a BoP crisis or debt crisis for a very long time.
1978 2018-12-18 21:08:41 Complete darkness with the smell of oil/gas.  These children were stolen.
1979 2018-12-18 21:08:26 I can’t believe i just noticed I needed an oil change and then I just ... went to get the oil change so this is what it’s like to have money cool

1982 2018-12-18 21:08:08 I need someone to recommend me a good beard oil/lotion because mine is just out of control
1983 2018-12-18 21:08:03 After my midnight debacle whereby I broke the glass litre bottle of olive oil all over the kitchen, I awoke to find that my hubby had washed the floors for me. The dogs “helped” last night by rolling in it. Great that I oiled my benches before Christmas, not!
1984 2018-12-18 21:08:02 Tony has a shit ton in the closet, seriously like 30 little bottles, maybe more. He uses them to make cleaning products & used to use them for beard oil lol. I know for sure we have peppermint though. Where do I put it on him??
1985 2018-12-18 21:08:02 Translation: "We had it great for 41 years, now lets wreck it for the future generation".  Of course it'll be easy when your income is a pension rather than a salary.
Do you remember the 3 day week, the 27% inflation, the oil crisis...?  Ahhh the good old days.

1994 2018-12-18 21:07:05 5 times 18 league titles  I'd like to see City doing that without any oil money
1995 2018-12-18 21:07:05 Supply drops to the North sea oil rigs are incredibly important. And patrolling UK waters for refugees in trouble is a noble endeavor. What else could I be referring to?
1996 2018-12-18 21:07:04 Oil. My daughter had the same problem at that age, about 2 tblspns before bed. Olive oil, something palatable and agreeable to the system.

1999 2018-12-18 21:06:48 They predicted £48bn in oil revenues in the first 6 years after the ref. 4 years in and it’s only £3bn!

2003 2018-12-18 21:06:34 I'd guess broader. Probably some option trades gone awry. Or hit by margin calls on liquid contracts. Basically it could be whatever, but oil and indices seem like best candidates.
2004 2018-12-18 21:06:30 Part I - Climate Policy Initiative claims $5 trillion is needed to solve climate change.  How about this: we take a tiny fraction of that amount and develop oil and coal technology to the point emissions are completely clean and perhaps even recyclable as usable energy.
2005 2018-12-18 21:06:26 Well the oil industry gets more than $3 billion in subsidies nationwide annually with the lion’s share going to Alberta. Today Alberta got $371 per citizen on top of that. Quebec’s equalization is $167 per citizen.

2009 2018-12-18 21:05:39 Do you buy oil? You can see where I’m going with this. How about you just don’t buy oil and make your own stand first, before telling other people to not buy big oil. How about you practice what you preach.

2013 2018-12-18 21:05:21 Totally clueless. The rest of the nation builds hospitals, schools and capital infrastructure projects utilizing money from oil. Unless of course you believe it just materializes from Unicorn darts.
2014 2018-12-18 21:05:13 I'm in Scotland and the Scot Govt is reasonably competent and ready to go it alone. We hav 33% of the UK land mass, 9% of the population, oil and and other great natural resources. 
Can you take Trident back? Bye, bye. #peoplesvote
2015 2018-12-18 21:04:47 I do the same but with water and it works wonders with oil control and I feel like my dark spots are fading too
2016 2018-12-18 21:04:45 Spilled a whole ass container of dressing THAT I HAD JUST MADE full of vinegar and oil today & had to clean that up and then i Lost $20 at work today also. It’s a great fucking day.
2017 2018-12-18 21:04:42 I thought only oil was supposed to last for eight days... not a scenic view of plumber's crack. So sorry that happened.
2018 2018-12-18 21:04:39 @PowerbangGaming have you noticed black paint or oil splatter patterns in certain buildings ?? What’s that about ?

2025 2018-12-18 21:04:06 Kickbacks. Russian oil revenues.
2026 2018-12-18 21:03:54 $Oil probably headed back down to $24 a barrel. $SPY $CL_F $Trump has been saying all year he wants oil to drop.
2027 2018-12-18 21:03:49 2021 renewable energy has been perfected, leading to new industrial production standards globally, baby boomers dig there hills in the sand screaming at the top of thier lungs "millennials are killing the war for oil industry in middle eastern countries" as they eat ambient pills
2028 2018-12-18 21:03:47 I really love crispy Brussel sprouts so I usually pan fry mine in some olive oil and season with salt/pepper, cayenne, lil paprika, and garlic salt and I cut em the same way
2029 2018-12-18 21:03:46 Hate the idea of paying for beard oil, but I think I’m going to buy some. Not a beard balm fan and I want this winter beard to keep fresh
2030 2018-12-18 21:03:46 Yeah that said they are also the comunity most involved in large dildos too
The one pony i do know worked in the oil industry in the 70s for example
2031 2018-12-18 21:03:44 why so you can hide the billions you're donating you oil companies and you big farm to keep douchebags in office so that you will remain tax-free? Absolutely not the people have a right to know
2032 2018-12-18 21:03:39 Actually we need to decarbonize our energy system entirely, and you're right - that's a national endeavour. The feds need to make serious plans and fund transition plans that make sense for every region. We all stand to lose with a lack of planning for life after oil.
2033 2018-12-18 21:03:38 "Tie treaty money to oil royalty". What the actual fuck?
2034 2018-12-18 21:03:37 A guy said you have a huge oil leak under your jeep theres a puddle.
I said its not mine I don't put enough in it to leave a puddle.
2035 2018-12-18 21:03:29 Same for Saudi oil money ! Once its gone its gone !
2036 2018-12-18 21:03:22 No Heid, that would be wrong. He is yours and yours alone.
2037 2018-12-18 21:03:20 my fckn dab oil pen shit thingy broke so I’m having instant gratification withdrawals
2038 2018-12-18 21:03:13 Norway has more oil coming out the ground and they nationalised it years ago. That won’t wash now. They heyday has gone.
2039 2018-12-18 21:03:03 Because it was so hot here the coconut oil was mostly liquid. The consistency is like a bar today. So maybe warm up the coconut oil beforehand and mix then let it cool and see what it's like?
2040 2018-12-18 21:02:56 Lol I dont think so, which of them particularly can you do
2041 2018-12-18 21:02:45 This is interesting

2044 2018-12-18 21:02:29 by the end of the following week Oil rallied @ $2.30 & 6% ... then made a new contract low Jan 6 and didn't make a real low until Feb 11
2045 2018-12-18 21:02:29 Still have subsidies for oil exploration tho!

2049 2018-12-18 21:02:21 O es el oil, o "yaina" o el government shutdown o el niño o lpqlrp.
2050 2018-12-18 21:02:19 Saw it on the news lucky no disaster oil ensued
2051 2018-12-18 21:02:18 So Let me get this straight

 The new head of Dept of  INTERIOR  is an OIL LOBBYIST??

& “Getting things done” is CODE for rolling back environmental protections?

Adding insult to injury you seem 2 b A-OK even excited about appt.

@CoralMDavenport is this right or am I mistaken?
2052 2018-12-18 21:02:08 good afternoon olive oil is juice
2053 2018-12-18 21:02:01 I've always known you have some low-key oil on your head. 
2054 2018-12-18 21:02:01 You're right
2055 2018-12-18 21:01:55 At $46 a barrel of oil. Gas should be under $2.00 a gallon. Just keep screwing us Big business!!!
2056 2018-12-18 21:01:42 Wonder if the CTAs are making their years back with these continuing Oil plunge.
2057 2018-12-18 21:01:33 She taught me you can check oil with a dip stick you don't have to look under the vehicle to see if you still have oil
2058 2018-12-18 21:01:26 Just who is the "we" in this sentence Brad? Are you organizing a consumer boycott against some oil company --
2059 2018-12-18 21:01:16 i just got described as the “little blonde girl with the black kia” at the place i’m getting my oil changed and i feel attacked
2060 2018-12-18 21:01:14 If it makes you feel better it all still gets recycled. All the waste gets separated to ensure 100% of waste is recycled right down to the oil and waste food
2061 2018-12-18 21:01:13 I studied PHE.
2062 2018-12-18 21:01:04 Та пока жива
2063 2018-12-18 21:01:01 Whale oil beef hooked
2064 2018-12-18 21:00:59 Do u even have a clue, what about the Oil Tankers or the trains filled with Petroleum. Going cross canada and US for how many years? For God Sake don't put a pileline in that's more secure.
2065 2018-12-18 21:00:44 If educating young children wasn't a mostly female profession, it would pay better. It may be less dangerous than oil rigging, but it is of more importance. Oil rig accident, yes that's serious but lack of good education gets you SkyNews... Pay teachers what they deserve.
2066 2018-12-18 21:00:38 So loans and a small amount of capital for diversification (not oil and gas projects). What a joke.
2067 2018-12-18 21:00:34 Clever of you to  conveniently omit the crude oil prices for the same period. Crude oil today is 2.5 - 3 times cheaper.  Taxes are also up by 300%  and 100% of  petrol/diesel. Govt. raked in the moolah and spent it foolishing on freebies, and now wants to raid RBI!

2071 2018-12-18 21:00:27 well donny's getting his lower oil prices

2073 2018-12-18 21:00:09 wow! $oil can really fall huh?
2074 2018-12-18 21:00:09 Can anyone give me some evidence that global oil demand is falling off?
@LukeGromen @AndurandPierre @anasalhajji @JosefSchachter @OpenSquareCap
2075 2018-12-18 21:00:07 So keep importing oil?  And what do you propose replaces oil in oil based products?
2076 2018-12-18 21:00:04 So he arose and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.

2 Kings 9:6
2077 2018-12-18 20:59:59 Didn't South Africa send troops to fight alongside Joseph Kabila soldiers against M23 rebels in DRC with rumours that they were also protecting Zuma's oil resource deals, through Khulubuse, worth millions?
2078 2018-12-18 20:59:58 1.1 trn form customs +5.3trn from FIRS, Oil sector is not left out. Mr President kept borrowing and complaining: Nigeria done surfer.
2079 2018-12-18 20:59:52 @francoislegault oil should flow in  pipelines and not on rails.  Wake up to the reality and stop this non sensical pointe of view.  Do not assume better than experts.  I travel on AMT train to work beside rail cars of oil... in Montreal.  You really think that is what we want?
2080 2018-12-18 20:59:47 $USO Storage wars started yet? Milk vs Oil
2081 2018-12-18 20:59:45 How do you know
2082 2018-12-18 20:59:36 Don't know if this will work but try lavender oil with a warm washcloth and some chamomile tea .
2083 2018-12-18 20:59:35 I’m not sure the same rules apply now with oil dollars coming in to play. City threw enough money to become contenders virtually overnight. Man u could possibly do the same unfortunately.
2084 2018-12-18 20:59:27 It’s a cultural thing.  We’re taught that the sacred CEO’s & Conservative politicians put the oil in the ground & created our great Alberta Advantage.
2085 2018-12-18 20:59:22 Ladies help us fellas out and be our beard oil
2086 2018-12-18 20:59:05 NON OIL BASED
2087 2018-12-18 20:58:58 Not a good move.  Canada made billions on the deal. It supports thousands of Canadian workers. Its a vehicle, not "Arms"

The better move is to stop importing their oil.
2088 2018-12-18 20:58:56 Buy Big Oil then ?
2089 2018-12-18 20:58:51 Some are flexible o!
2090 2018-12-18 20:58:48 Music, audio books too, essential oil, litoterapia
2091 2018-12-18 20:58:38 If there wasn’t enough carbon in the air then cars wouldn’t work. They would just blow up. Too much carbon then more fuel is needed. The earth does breath and the life that made the oil stripped the world of most of the oxygen. High O2 =intercontinental forest fires
2092 2018-12-18 20:58:26 Just a guess:

Maybe it's like oil pipelines and football stadiums. The real money is in the contracts to build the thing. Actually running something on an ongoing basis isn't as lucrative. 

If the grift is winding down, try to get some good PR out of it. Very Javanka.
2093 2018-12-18 20:58:20 Ogbeni lo sase
2094 2018-12-18 20:58:14 On my side my loss on this is just now too big and I am cutting...Even with all the call selling all it did was soften the pain...Now I am want to be out of oil for a while. It is probably a good bottom here for CL if I was just finally forced out.
2095 2018-12-18 20:58:10 Actually Canada will take a huge hit. Oil and gas is 24% of the TSX, Oil and gas is Canada’s greatest export at $120 B/yr. Oil and gas contributes on average $25 B/yr in taxes and royalties to fed and provincial coffers. Canada needs to stop importing oil and use our own.
2096 2018-12-18 20:58:06 Remember bouncing back from things like that? Glad you can ease the misery at least a bit. I may have get some of this CBD oil.Not sure it's legal in Illinois.Used Ketamine creme during chemo tx.That helped. Used to have hubby rub it on my back. He never wore gloves-he liked it
2097 2018-12-18 20:58:01 I was there in early 80s when the floor fell out from oil. Lots of expensive homes from executives were everywhere.
2098 2018-12-18 20:58:00 Barrel of oil and RBOB gasoline are tanking today.  New bottom for oil is $40.  If current prices hold, gas at the pump likely drops another 30 cents a gallon after the first of the year.
2099 2018-12-18 20:57:58 olive oil is my favorite food
2100 2018-12-18 20:57:52 I use oil lol I just don’t like the texture of my shit
2101 2018-12-18 20:57:50 Is there a CBD oil that makes people stop talking about CBD oil?
2102 2018-12-18 20:57:45 my sil is heading for the EI line-up in the New Year.  Not because he's in the oil and gas sector in AB but because the economy in AB is on its knees and no new construction is happening.  THis money is simply the Liberals attempting to buy votes in AB..
2103 2018-12-18 20:57:32 Old enough to remember when oil was going to $100 this year
2104 2018-12-18 20:57:31 Mark Hoffman and Steve Burke must be two complete morons to have Sara Eisen in such a prime spot.  Eisen is negative, doesn't have a clue, unabashedly anti-Trump, and truly applauds down markets.  She is no @MariaBartiromo @cnbc
2105 2018-12-18 20:57:31 I am enjoying the game and will be playing it for years but KCD and NMS do what they do with more heart than RDR2. Taking poppy and mixing it with mint and oil will always hold a special place in my heart. Same with being a pioneer of one of the most sought after spots in nmspace
2106 2018-12-18 20:57:23 -African black soap with spin brush
-witch hazel as toner
-murula oil moisturizer
2107 2018-12-18 20:57:22 What’s your plan Andrew? Muzzle scientists, cancel carbon revenue and more billion dollar subsidies for oil? Anything else? Nothing? Making assault weapons easier to get. Anything good? A single idea? I’ll wait
2108 2018-12-18 20:57:21 Wouldn’t it be something If we don’t build a pipeline and a train derails carrying millions of tons of oil. That will make the tree huggers happy right?
2109 2018-12-18 20:57:20 Experimenting with white & pink noise to improve focus, because I’m a robot. Beep boop bork berk.

Feed me oil and gears and computer chips. Thanks!

I mean, ACKNOWLEDGE.
2110 2018-12-18 20:57:19 Boy or girl baby? My girls stayed more constipated due to too much iron in their diets and afraid they were pushing out their insides Try castoria not castor oil, a little in their juice and drink more water the trick make it with unsweetened koolaid
2111 2018-12-18 20:57:19 I remember Allegri struggled at AC Milan. I would prefer Conte personally. He has a league championship in England so that's a plus. I still think any team would struggle against Pep's Oil funded Squad. Klopp is giving him a challenge and my be Conte can as well
2112 2018-12-18 20:57:13 @AndrewScheer invents crisis in Alberta’s oil industry., blames PM. Today’ Andrew invents another crisis, calls $1.6 bn aid from PM an election ploy. #scheernotready #cdnpoli
2113 2018-12-18 20:57:12 Poloz said that Canadians have to get used to higher rates on October  30th.  Oil has dropped 30% since then.  Forecasting is hard.
2114 2018-12-18 20:57:06 U just need some good oil. Not grease.
2115 2018-12-18 20:57:04 Listen, there are lots of people that still need oil and gas.  Find those markets and don't worry about the East.  Eventually they will come around when their cars are empty.
2116 2018-12-18 20:57:04 First its not oil its gaz, learn by yoursel instead of stupid english twitter account. Second u spend 200 millions on lukaku and pogba and 100 millions on Fred and Dalot. I think there is a little problem on your club atm  50 millions Matic  45M Mata sorry i cant 
2117 2018-12-18 20:56:48 Excedingly good powers of observation spider if I may say so :)
2118 2018-12-18 20:56:38 Oil finally headed in right direction ,
2119 2018-12-18 20:56:28 Hmm so I bought this enhancement oil stuff that’s suppose to make you really sensitive, I wonder if it’ll actually work? Or just be a disappointment? Only time will tell
2120 2018-12-18 20:56:22 Tell him to QUIT taking money from Big Oil. What is his position on Overturning Citizens United? Single Payer? Ending subsidies for Big Oil? Closing loopholes for corporate America? Voting Rights Act? MANY unanswered questions
2121 2018-12-18 20:56:03 Sorry to hear that. CBD oil is great for anxiety and pain! 

Good luck
2122 2018-12-18 20:56:02 Need to change the oil in Marvin soon
2123 2018-12-18 20:55:47 Change your own oil girly man
2124 2018-12-18 20:55:35 Man what a day... brought my truck in to be looked at, $1600 for a new water pump, belt, oil change, transmission flush and coolant flush... holy fuck 

Just wanted to chill and stream some Fortnite but internet god hate my guts so that ain’t working either! Help me out my guy!
2125 2018-12-18 20:55:27 OMG /CL please make it stop. Can I get I Mella oil chart? Or should I just assume oil is going to zero?
2126 2018-12-18 20:55:19 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
2127 2018-12-18 20:55:11 Oil ‘slips’ or ‘slides’ to 1 year...
2128 2018-12-18 20:54:52 So you are trying to say Obama administration increased the oil drilling in the USA 
Are you saying that Obama made American the biggest oil producer in the world
2129 2018-12-18 20:54:49 Not true. Dumpster fires are well contained. 

You're describing an oil spill. Also on fire.
2130 2018-12-18 20:54:48 Not to feel good for the London workers! How fucking stupid are Canadians,we will destroy thousands of Canadians lives to teach those Saudis at the same time buy their oil, is there anybody in this country that has a brain and understands economics 101
2131 2018-12-18 20:54:47 You like oil up yourself aye
2132 2018-12-18 20:54:47 Ji bakinta awa love 
2133 2018-12-18 20:54:43 I don't see how your raise rates tomorrow. Oil plummeting, inflation expectations falling, job growth deceleration, global trade uncertainty, housing market has weakened.  If you do go tomorrow, you really have to signal that you're done unless things improve.
2134 2018-12-18 20:54:38 WTI Crude Oil -7.2% to 46.57 bbl $USO
Gold +0.2% at 1253.30 oz $GLD
Copper -3.3% to 2.66 lb  $CU
2135 2018-12-18 20:54:33 Alberta would probably have a pipeline by now if they didn't treat the rest of Canada & Canadian's concerns as though they were secondary to the wants of Albertans. Alberta survived before oil. Where is that good old pioneering spirit now? Drowning in the whine of selfentitlement
2136 2018-12-18 20:54:30 What a total waste of money the country spend for the Alberta oil. Let the economy recover by itself!
2137 2018-12-18 20:54:28 Risqué sur oil...cette stratégie !!!

2140 2018-12-18 20:54:10 FYI, this bogus article is by the Oil Industry! #FakeNews
2141 2018-12-18 20:54:09 Rising star?  She is pretty and that is it.  She either reads off of cue cards, teleprompter or repeats what is said in her ear.  I promise you IQ not 100.  They need to get rid of her.  She is no Maria @MariaBartiromo
2142 2018-12-18 20:54:05 All I want for Christmas is Aveeno oil
2143 2018-12-18 20:54:04 How does the rest of the country understanding that Albertans hate all of our neighbours and all of their stupid customs and languages that aren’t oil and gas help us build a pipeline?
2144 2018-12-18 20:54:00 Fennel oil is excellent for nursing mothers.  I would suggest this for my own daughter to use.
2145 2018-12-18 20:53:37 No oil either Lmaoo
2146 2018-12-18 20:53:35 Oh thanks Spiderkebab...you can share my Uncle with me if you want.
2147 2018-12-18 20:53:34 There's no way Powell says oh we are at 25 whatever I can't raise. But, CRB declining, oil declining, premiums coming in, curve near 0 etc. Can always make an economic case, all depends what you believe they actually move on. Truth  somewhere in middle
2148 2018-12-18 20:53:30 I love a fresh oil change 
2149 2018-12-18 20:53:22 the MOST pro-life oil in my experience at least
2150 2018-12-18 20:53:20 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2151 2018-12-18 20:53:14 try a beauty oil for during the day and a vitamin e oil at night time, that’s what i do after washing and moisturizing. the vitamin e oil has really really helped with the dry skin 
2152 2018-12-18 20:53:06 They do that to me, too. At some point, the credit card companies got the idea that I'm the lone heir to a rich oil baron.
2153 2018-12-18 20:53:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Plunging oil prices pull energy stocks lower, erasing gains
2154 2018-12-18 20:53:02 I need more oil!! #letsomedrops #nowfallonne
2155 2018-12-18 20:52:56 Burnie by Midnight Oil. Raw acoustic track from the Scream in Blue live album.
2156 2018-12-18 20:52:46 Assets? Water, renewable energies for a start which is what the world will need when that oil runs out. England has no more industry than we do. All they have financial services - which we also have.
2157 2018-12-18 20:52:36 China won't cash in but may not buy more debt and Saudi Arabia can only purchase so much!

With oil down to $47 a barrel there's no more money to buy US debt!
2158 2018-12-18 20:52:29 I'm still disappointed that no one picked up on my idea of dyeing oil green...so that we could call it green energy.
2159 2018-12-18 20:52:21 You got to be kidding. We need to leave oil in the ground and only use renewable energy going forward to save the planet
@ClimateReality @algore says no
2160 2018-12-18 20:52:20 Extra virgin baby oil.
2161 2018-12-18 20:52:19 Me! We love to race! My 10 yr boy races in the Lucas oil circuit. I’m his spotter!
2162 2018-12-18 20:52:12 Does it make any difference? Would a Russian oligarch or some obscure oil rich funding be a better choice? Hardly I reckon.
2163 2018-12-18 20:52:09 We didn’t want this money. We want jobs. Our heads are well positioned out of the sand. I totally agree with you that the oil sands days are numbered but what I keep seeing is the OUTGOING industry by Liberal standards does not deserve any respect for all that we have contributed
2164 2018-12-18 20:52:07 We should burn oil to generate electricity to charge Tesla. #winwin
2165 2018-12-18 20:52:02 Just got scammed for an expensive ass oil change lmaoo
2166 2018-12-18 20:51:39 Well if need any help refitting it just ask I work on the oil rigs and would love job at home for a few weeks in the new year 
2167 2018-12-18 20:51:39 In 2014 I was working in oil and gas, still am.

Nearly every other job sector in Canada has seen growth since 2014, so don't give me this "no one has been hiring for 4 years" bs.
2168 2018-12-18 20:51:34 How did they find and open the engine oil cap?
2169 2018-12-18 20:51:30 That whole social justice play was a dismal failure, and now she's pretending to support oil and gas hoping for reelection.  Gone soon!
2170 2018-12-18 20:51:29 I only enjoy taking a thirst trap when I’m fresh out the shower literally slathered in Shea butter and tea tree oil . I like how the sun bounces off my skin lmao
2171 2018-12-18 20:51:27 jak można nazwać zespół midnight oil...
2172 2018-12-18 20:51:24 Be patient, Craig. The Scots will get their independence...............when the oil runs out!
2173 2018-12-18 20:51:22 He’s also not there to explain why he’s such an Oily Dem who has our state awash in dirty, toxic, poison oil and gas while he pals around with oil lobbyists. Jerry will be dead but his climate chickens will be home to roost forever
2174 2018-12-18 20:51:07 Isolated events? The federal Liberals gave the oil sands accelerated capital cost allowances worth $300M/year between 1996 and when the Harper government phased them out between 2010-4. The Liberals have just brought them back.
2175 2018-12-18 20:51:06 Por fundamental, Resol por debajo de $50  el precio del crude oil, no es rentable la compañía!! Se va al garete.
2176 2018-12-18 20:51:05 I use this with a couple of drops of tea tree oil and it’s kept my skin clear better than any thing else.
2177 2018-12-18 20:50:56 Important questions to ask Lagos governorship aspirants.
1. How do you plan to clean up Lagos?
2. How do you plan to make sure valuable man-hours aren't wasted in Lagos traffic?
2178 2018-12-18 20:50:41 Oil on Canvas, eu nasci pra te amar
2179 2018-12-18 20:50:41 Loans? How many oil & gas companies are going to want to gear up their balance sheets at this point?
2180 2018-12-18 20:50:33 Holds head in hands... shakes head.. walks away from Twitter again... people just get their panties in a bunch about the stupidest of things.. a harmless joke How do you get from a Chrunchie to a tweet about chuffin Palm Oil.... get a life #Numpty
2181 2018-12-18 20:50:29 Bye oil industry. 
2182 2018-12-18 20:50:26 the diesel cooking oil being promoted needs an engine up grade  (average cost 4 a i.e. vw tdi $2000.00) & the EPA has classified the use of cooking oil fuel a violation of the clean air act w/ fines up to $2750.00.  B5 to B1oo 20  to 90 cents more per gal  off the shelf oil 8-9 $
2183 2018-12-18 20:50:25 FYI: $AAL does not hedge Oil as $LUV or other airlines. Cost savings go directly to bottom line.
2184 2018-12-18 20:50:25 They stole money that was donated 2 charity & paid off settlements on other law suits, bought an oil painting of himself 4 his club, used it 2 campaign & 4 other personal expenses. I'd love 2 know how much $$ he took in over the years, that he stole 4 personal use & 2 lower taxes
2185 2018-12-18 20:50:21 I wouldn’t serve them with chili oil, that’s usually wheat noodles. soba are more traditional more simply with broth
2186 2018-12-18 20:50:20 It’s carbonated motor oil
2187 2018-12-18 20:50:20 That's strange comment, there was no handout to any Energy workers! Only handout was to the Oil Billionaires. Nice try, maybe u can invite more foriegn workers like Harper, Notley, and Trudeau. They're all the same time for a real change and send a message to main stream parties
2188 2018-12-18 20:50:17 You're not eccentric, they are just all dull, boring rah rah spam heads.
2189 2018-12-18 20:50:12 I like the technical action of the #StockMarket today all the while with oil down a massive 7+%. Sweet action at the close for me
2190 2018-12-18 20:50:06 This hair oil got my hair on fleeekkkkk
2191 2018-12-18 20:50:05 oil and gas, oil and gas, oil and gas and oil and gas. Canada needs to stop funding oil and gas and start investing in clean energy and renewable resources because we don't have any more time to be doubling down on the thing destroying our planet!
2192 2018-12-18 20:50:03 I fucking cant with him and his oil
2193 2018-12-18 20:49:58 Try eucalyptus essential oil.
2194 2018-12-18 20:49:54 November Housing Starts jump. Oil prices decline, gas prices fall. Housing inventories increase.    #economy #housing #gasprices @Equitysourcemtg
2195 2018-12-18 20:49:36 I suspect it would help some. Even a eucalyptus essential oil in the shower might help. Couple drops on the shower floor and let the hot water hit it.
2196 2018-12-18 20:49:36 They all sold out. Especially the snake oil salesman rubio
2197 2018-12-18 20:49:34 My older brother is making breakfast he doesn’t cook, he came up to me and said “the potatoes are a trial type of potatoes next time I won’t put to whole bag in with as much oil as it tells me to” I swear
2198 2018-12-18 20:49:28 How much of that money came from the oil? 
2199 2018-12-18 20:49:25 Mr. Scott have you considered CBD Oil as an anti-inflammatory? Could help with the pain. Good luck :)
2200 2018-12-18 20:49:19 My car was low on oil once 10+ years ago; My dad has never ever let me forget it and in his mind, if he would not have checked and added oil that day, my car would have exploded and ceased to be. In his mind, my dad has saved the world countless times.
2201 2018-12-18 20:49:15 mybe oil all of his body.....
2202 2018-12-18 20:49:05 Google should be dismantled, like what happened to Standard Oil.
2203 2018-12-18 20:49:05 That's  Wonderful!!! Leave food out they will come. The possums here eat black oil sunflower seeds(from the low feeders),cat food and dog food I love the possum cousins 
2204 2018-12-18 20:49:04 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
2205 2018-12-18 20:49:03 Ever had one of those days where you’re so fucking tired, what seems to make sense in your head comes out as absolute shite?!

Today is one of those days 

Didn’t take my CBD oil this morning so the pain doesn’t help either.
2206 2018-12-18 20:49:03 Since when, were migrants corporations, or corporations migrants? The only "people" making America poorer, dirtier and more divide are corporations. Few more so than health insurers, Big Oil & Big Coal, Fox news.
2207 2018-12-18 20:48:58 Anti oil policies remain in place. No amount of bribe cash has changed that.

Get with it
2208 2018-12-18 20:48:55 Government of Canada is giving $1.6 billion to oil companies!!!!
2209 2018-12-18 20:48:54 a close in eur/nok this week above 9.8700 would be the highest weekly close since the 08 calamity - and oil isnt remotely close to the 09 or 2016 lows.
2210 2018-12-18 20:48:41 I also threw up the whole way home from Vegas & my bf made sure I had 3 grams of oil & a clean house to come home to...... oh and he cleaned my PARENTS house... god bless that man
2211 2018-12-18 20:48:25 The oil companies laid off people because they were attempting to become/continue to be profitable in the face of new global competition.

2213 2018-12-18 20:48:17 Pathetic how the US announced some weeks back their 4 the 1st time in 75yrs energy self sufficient. Now here is energy rich Canada with zero need for foreign BLOOD OIL circling the drain. The way dear leader Trudeau handles Canada is scarily similar to Venezuelan dictator Maduro.
2214 2018-12-18 20:48:10 Can you make Mac and cheese w whole grain pasta? Picky eaters make it difficult.  You can make cupcakes w 1 can pumpkin purée and box of cake mix (white yellow or spice) (no eggs or oil) and stir in raisins or cut up dried fruit for fiber
2215 2018-12-18 20:48:07 Well yes. You could actually skip the precision pouring as the dipstick will always indicate that there’s enough oil in the engine if you take it out and then pour the oil all over it.
2216 2018-12-18 20:48:06 Not when oil prices drop even further because of a collapse in demand. Russia got hit hard after 2008 because of the loss of oil revenue. Don’t think there are any winners here
2217 2018-12-18 20:48:00 The quality of the oil has hurt Alberta as much as anything and the Province has refused to diversify. You produce bitumen and generally it’s at a cost to both the ecosystem and the economy.
2218 2018-12-18 20:47:58 “Quebec has not used any oil products from Saudi Arabia since 2006”

Um that chart only shows direct crude oil imports. Try again.
2219 2018-12-18 20:47:53 It is a cute lil *essential oil diffuser*. You fill it with water & the oil of your choice & it shoots it out in the form of relaxing scents 
2220 2018-12-18 20:47:49 Oil swell that ends well.
2221 2018-12-18 20:47:42 Oil companies don't want govt handouts.  The stupidity of this Liberal govt is astounding.  Get the pipeline built and stand aside.
2222 2018-12-18 20:47:23 Babyboomers need to realize their votes for the union powerhouse @TheDemocrats is killing the #Constitution with #socialism at every turn.  It is no longer a vote between oil tycoons and the poor.  It has turned into representative republic vs socialism.  Vote #Republicans
2223 2018-12-18 20:47:10 Big facts. Oil money spent on good football = best oil money spent
2224 2018-12-18 20:47:10 Thank God it wasn't full of imported oil #UKOG
2225 2018-12-18 20:47:01 I want my eyebrows to be fuller without filling them in. Other than black castor oil what can help them become thicker?
2226 2018-12-18 20:47:00 and less people to feed...so contraception. We need fuel & energy but that can be done by lithium batteries in the future. Oil or gas is needed for the transportation of food, but we can cut way back on vehicles.....We are coming from a time when vehicles were not in existence.
2227 2018-12-18 20:46:42 whats more valuable to england Scottish resources and oil compared to its citizens leaving Eu call me cynical but uk as part of Eu wouldn’t get away with deploying troops and closing Scottish parliament as eu member and subject to its laws most things unthinkable till it happens
2228 2018-12-18 20:46:40 Skl  yung boss ko alam na Army ako, papagawan nia daw ako ng oil painting with bts, hahanap daw siya ng nakatopless sila  
2229 2018-12-18 20:46:39 Your head get oil abeg
2230 2018-12-18 20:46:37 Silver is interesting, its way undervalued and it has most uses in manufacturing goods beside oil.
2231 2018-12-18 20:46:33 All that oil  that's right I'm praising oil
2232 2018-12-18 20:46:32 what kind of oil?
2233 2018-12-18 20:46:31 Mamador is the Oil I use in cooking, I hereby pledge that it would be the Official Cooking Oil of every member of my immediate and extended family #Mamador #MamadorHealthyTastyClub cc: @davidosilvado @x_rayeyes @tosinfadare
2234 2018-12-18 20:46:09 Electric cars should have been compulsory long ago, hence no oil!
2235 2018-12-18 20:46:00 just be gentle and use a soft brush for blending! also eyeshadow primer helps it shine. ALSO use a finger to swatch the color onto ur eyelid first cus the oil in skin makes it pop better so that's how u want 2 start
2236 2018-12-18 20:45:58 Red oil ke, 
2237 2018-12-18 20:45:48 Hai! Have you tried any products with colloidal oatmeal and/or almond oil? Xx
2238 2018-12-18 20:45:47 >>с кем-то. Вывести на что-то свой стресс. Или, например, попробовать на чистоту поговорить с родителями. Мне это помогло решить дома множество проблем. Можешь посоветоваться с кем-то, кто шарит в теме решения подобных проблем. Интернет-психологи/горячая линия. Думаю это поможет
2239 2018-12-18 20:45:42 750BLN barrels of oil was burned since late 1800. At 5861520kJ per barrel, mass of atmosphere 5.1 x 10^18 and heat capacity of air we get (750BLN * 5861520) / (5.1 x 10^18) / 1.006 = 0.85684715238˚ which's the temperature increase in our atmosphere due to oil induced entropy.
2240 2018-12-18 20:45:41 Giving the Canadian energy industry  ( oil produced in Alberta ) a blood transfusion while twisting a tourniquet applied to ones neck is not the answer.
2241 2018-12-18 20:45:29 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2242 2018-12-18 20:45:28 The damming report on MBIE oil & gas & Thompson and Clark shows we need a separation of oil & state.
2243 2018-12-18 20:45:23 ...as long as it doesn't dissolve <_<

"Oil slick, drink it quick"
2244 2018-12-18 20:45:19 Mmmm CBD oil kinda pricey ... but I def gta get some for my dad to help w his back pain and stress! #cbdoil #cbd 
2245 2018-12-18 20:45:19 If you are holding an US oil stock right now, you are a brave person.
The economics of many shale companies and those with archaic declining conventional leases are in deep poo.
No pun intended. POO $46 bl

$BRK $AOW $SEA $WBE $E2E $FPL
2246 2018-12-18 20:45:12 Worth noting: although Judas Curry is a very intelligent and knowledgeable scientist, her current role as one of the few outspoken climate deniers has coincided with receipt of hefty funding from oil while setting up a private consulting firm that doesn't disclose its donors.
2247 2018-12-18 20:45:10 But how will get the oil to market. Are pipelines dead
2248 2018-12-18 20:44:51 Ok. Name one that doesn’t require oil.
2249 2018-12-18 20:44:50 *does oil change on my car thinking I’m maintaining her fucking great, blows engine same night *
2250 2018-12-18 20:44:47 Lunatic - she says she wants to be remembered for her transparency and truthfulness.  She needs an oil change and a new timing belt!  She's not firing on all cylinders.
2251 2018-12-18 20:44:34 Then why blame Ottawa when it was the oil companies that laid people off?
2252 2018-12-18 20:44:32 Oil won’t be out of lots of industries until alternate products are found to replace them. Like healthcare.
2253 2018-12-18 20:44:19 $1.6 billion is 20 days of loses to the oil industry. This is like putting a glass of water on a forest fire.
2254 2018-12-18 20:44:17 Going to be chasing like its 1991 again if the price of oil keeps going down.
2255 2018-12-18 20:44:17 Idiot doesn't know anything about oil and gas drilling works
2256 2018-12-18 20:44:16 I learn there is canola oil, vegetable oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, and etc.
2257 2018-12-18 20:44:15 What does oil going up have to do with nat gas being a short at these levels?
2258 2018-12-18 20:44:10 Agreed. In fact we r largest oil exporter in world right now, but it is still a tiny % of the total value of our exports. Net benefit to US of oil price far outweighs the increased costs (lower profits) to our oil industry, which is tiny part of our economy.
2259 2018-12-18 20:44:04 So easy!! Just heat up some oil, pour in the beans (canned works too) & let them heat up, then get to smashing w/a fork. At least that’s how I do it. Lol. & I add a bunch of Sazón (Goya).
2260 2018-12-18 20:44:02 Burning that midnight oil. Hope this pays off someday. In the meantime, #TrustTheProcess.
2261 2018-12-18 20:43:59 A cooking oil merchandiser is slowly gaining traction in the power matrix
2262 2018-12-18 20:43:47 Chelsea and City. Good that you identified fellow members of your oil club.
2263 2018-12-18 20:43:47 I need a dryer u can sit under  I been needing a hot oil treatment and deep conditioning SO bad.
2264 2018-12-18 20:43:36 Oil price goes down...bad. It goes up...bad too. Anybody know what’s the perfect price? Asking for investors everywhere.
2265 2018-12-18 20:43:32 Now you can invade alien worlds for their oil too! Go USA
2266 2018-12-18 20:43:13 Have u tried lavender oil with a warm washcloth and drink some chamomile . It may help .
2267 2018-12-18 20:43:09 We spend $29 billion subsidizing private business. We spend more subsidizing the oil industry alone and they make more in profits then we subsidize them, in return they are automating and laying people off. Same with automotive. We need a government that invests in people.
2268 2018-12-18 20:43:00 I've heard there is a company in Hawaii founded on oil money.
2269 2018-12-18 20:43:00 thats how i started and i miss it! oil painting is very forgiving and calming haha
2270 2018-12-18 20:42:57 Keep thinking that way.  It is simple to come up with isolated events, but the overwhelming direction of economic policy target by both PET and JT governments has been to limit free enterprise and to shut down AB oil industry.
2271 2018-12-18 20:42:55 Alberta oil companies are making billions in profit and paying billions in dividends to their share holders.

I find the idea of public money (my tax dollars) going to already profitable corporations to be distasteful and pointless.
2272 2018-12-18 20:42:39 At the end of the day with oil still cratering the system is already too tight ...
2273 2018-12-18 20:42:28 Пхахах
2274 2018-12-18 20:42:19 I lived through the 73 oil embargo when the speed limit went to 55. Sucked. I was driving a brand new 1973 Trans Am... all 455 cubic inches of it. Yes, it was a gas sucker but it didn't matter if it was 55 or 75.
2275 2018-12-18 20:42:19 Peeps should learn their game. ;)
2276 2018-12-18 20:42:12 Any decent bounce in oil is going to move $XLE materially higher, assuming the rest of the market floats higher.  I have no position but looking at calls.  The chart is beyond ugly.
2277 2018-12-18 20:42:10 Wasabi (my car) got new tires and brake fluid today, and the oil is getting changed rn 
2278 2018-12-18 20:42:10 It is truly critical as a femal to be able to do simple things when owning a car i.e. -check your oil, fill your tires, jump your car.
2279 2018-12-18 20:42:06 I’ve become someone that shops at Whole Foods and makes things like rosemary infused olive oil. Who am I lol
2280 2018-12-18 20:41:53 Who else u kno break down putting coconut oil on her asscheek n dat she can’t wash it off cuz it’s too waxy that’s some legendary yv shit
2281 2018-12-18 20:41:53 Eyes...that is really the bit I do not get. My posts on there are genuinely positive, ok I am a bit eccentric but that is me. But like Adrian said some of their posts surely arent legal...
2282 2018-12-18 20:41:47 (I'm actually métis, no biggie but I figured I'd correct just for posterity! thank you for the birthday wishes, please eat noodles with chili oil in my honour)
2283 2018-12-18 20:41:45 Yes, I am aware of all that Michael. But oil always comes back up. Seen this situation before. Look at that 5 year chart on $UWT. Be greedy when others are fearful.
2284 2018-12-18 20:41:40 Crude Oil WTI

dziś -7,1% 
17.12 -2,0% 
14.12 -2,6%
2285 2018-12-18 20:41:39 If oil keeps dropping why are gas prices increasing in Terre Haute?
2286 2018-12-18 20:41:32 @SaraEisen @WilfredFrost So, U.S. bond yields down hard, U.S. stocks in a vicious SELLOFF, oil prices down hard, Europe in a sharp slowdown, China slowing down, housing market in a sharp slowdown. Maybe the Fed SHOULD be listening to the President, or just do the right thing.
2287 2018-12-18 20:41:29 Make sure you report them
 That's the trick. And like positive posts. It help a lot.
2288 2018-12-18 20:41:15 Ever had those burps that taste like a mix of Fruity Pebbles, cashew milk, and fish oil? Anyway, somebody kiss me.
2289 2018-12-18 20:41:05 He voted to increase military spending three times under Trump, voted to fast track the tpp, voted against a ban on offshore oil drilling, and broke his no fossil fuel money pledge. Not a good record.
2290 2018-12-18 20:41:03 As Britain is a net importer of oil this is good news for the uk economy.
2291 2018-12-18 20:41:01 No fed support all smoke and mirrors still no ability to get oil to market
2292 2018-12-18 20:40:54 Lol that FULL sweetness, i respect your preference  still props to you for making plaintains at all, I'm still too scared of the oil to do it without help agshsjdkdkd
2293 2018-12-18 20:40:52 We already do have tons of research and development to get us on clean energy, that's my entire point. The oil and gas industry is just holding on for as long as they can make the big bucks at everyone else's expense.
2294 2018-12-18 20:40:26 woke up absolutely LIVID at the news that @JustinTrudeau and the liberal govt. is handing yet another billion dollars over to the oil industry but then listened to @sandela and @NoLore telling me that anger is survival 

so here's to being VERY MUCH ALIVE and pissed af into 2019
2295 2018-12-18 20:40:26 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
2296 2018-12-18 20:40:25 A wise man once said : "Nigeria's biggest export is not oil, it's people ".
2297 2018-12-18 20:40:20 Congrats, but oil will be $25 by then 
2298 2018-12-18 20:40:15 Yessss I took Shop and had a stepdad who raced IMCA modifieds and learning how to change my own oil and tires has proved useful. Wish they placed more emphasis on trades

2302 2018-12-18 20:40:02 all i wanted for christmas was an esstential oil diffuser and instead i got a sinus infection #cool
2303 2018-12-18 20:40:00 Yesterday's #DSI was 8 for the $SPY & $ES so today was a little anomaly for the broad market to be down; #oil #crude $CL selloff changed the picture; but I was long biased
2304 2018-12-18 20:40:00 I need a hot oil treatment and a haircut
2305 2018-12-18 20:39:58 Yo Tongue gotta make her body lock up like a 87’ Impala wit no oil in it
2306 2018-12-18 20:39:57 เบ
2307 2018-12-18 20:39:52 Get the oil moving to world markets dude. Anything else is futile and representative of your inaction.
2308 2018-12-18 20:39:51 Oil to 40$ in January. New Year energy rally is cancelled!
2309 2018-12-18 20:39:50 "USING OLIVE OIL DECREASES BREAST CANCER 50%" THE DOCTORS SHOW
2310 2018-12-18 20:39:28 Whale oil be fucked !
2311 2018-12-18 20:39:27 W8 what’s wrong with palm oil????
2312 2018-12-18 20:39:24 i may have neglected to bring my car in for the recall of a part of my trunk and regular service but At Least i manage to be food about regular oil changes 
2313 2018-12-18 20:39:18 Once the baby is here there won’t be all that pressure! They’ll turn the color of your skin! And you won’t even see them! The few I had were red and they went away.. vitamin E oil is my favorite!
2314 2018-12-18 20:39:18 Not unless we also stop buying Saudi oil ... I worked for GM Defense before it was bought by General Dynamics ... the contract will simply go state-side ... not much of a stand by Trudeau ... more half-assed virtue-signalling is all ... at the expense of CDN jobs ...
2315 2018-12-18 20:39:18 Excited for some oil money?
2316 2018-12-18 20:39:15 For warning beto ain't the saint your looking for be has pledged his allegiance to the oil and gas industry and thus the #corporatesystem #corruptsystem and it's time to say #FuckTheSystem #yellowvests
2317 2018-12-18 20:39:13 My first car was a ford and it got me from a to b every time and I didn’t have to take it to the shop for anything but an oil change 
2318 2018-12-18 20:39:12 I can't get behind Beto. He's not only in bed with the Oil industry but also Wall Street.
2319 2018-12-18 20:39:11 Fortunately you’re not going for the Supreme Leader Trumpdoscopy. There’s a drive thru clinic that checks you & your cars lube and oil - all in one stop - while entombed in a 3-D virtual reality setting that shows nothing but @PressSec sizzle reels. #MakingAmericaGoatsAgain
2320 2018-12-18 20:39:08 There are myriad ways government agencies raise $ apart from income tax. Oil & gas leasing, war bonds, licensing, timber sales, toll booths, import/export duties......not to say feds have surplussed any/all of the above, just that these hairs may be split.
2321 2018-12-18 20:39:03 Why the fuck is CAD melting off ffss we’re supposed to be taking you lil shit $USDCAD $USDTWI #Oil #fx #forex
2322 2018-12-18 20:39:03 Let there be cheap oil.
2323 2018-12-18 20:39:02 Using the cap to pour the oil in the small hole was genius though, wasn't it?
2324 2018-12-18 20:39:02 What’s your stance on palm oil?
2325 2018-12-18 20:39:01 if I put that they would all report me an I would get a ban. Knob ends.
2326 2018-12-18 20:38:48 Have you noticed that the Canola Council is now peddling ORGANIC oil 

Can you go pick me a canola!?  = in the name of greed & bigger profits for those who use this stuff.  

Much healthier options: coconut, sesame, sunflower, olive, avocado, etc. - yet much watch these too
2327 2018-12-18 20:38:46 WOMEN GO GET YA DAMN OIL CHANGED. If you don’t know where to go, ask. I swear it ain’t expensive at all. Take care of your car ESPECIALLY if you got kids.
2328 2018-12-18 20:38:45 I could keep going (clean it zero is banila co’s cleansing oil line and I like the basic one best)
2329 2018-12-18 20:38:42 Did someone invent Mr. Fusion and forget to tell anyone? Because oil $USO is falling off a cliff along with oil co's.
2330 2018-12-18 20:38:27 How much did the oil industry pay manufacturers to install this auto start/stop feature? There’s no way this is actually better for us
2331 2018-12-18 20:38:24 Bizarre ton trade sur oil alors que tu avais un SL a 49 !!!
2332 2018-12-18 20:38:19 I like Beto, but progressives who want Bernie are currently trying to make Beto look bad because he’s taken money from big oil companies  I LIKE Richard Ojeda 
2333 2018-12-18 20:37:48 Whoever invented drive thru oil changes were genius!!! I just get to sit in my car and mind my business while they do all the work!
2334 2018-12-18 20:37:46 Yea Joy thinks it’s perma damage. Apparently he drove without enough oil for a bit

2338 2018-12-18 20:37:36 Liberal Federal government doubles down and invests another 1.6 billion dollars to ensure Alberta Oil doesn't get to market.
2339 2018-12-18 20:37:35 How come they never demand more women in jobs like garbage pickup, portable toilet cleanout, septic tank maintenance, skyscraper construction, and oil rig repair?
2340 2018-12-18 20:37:34 $73 for a fucking oil change wow
2341 2018-12-18 20:37:31 Buy Oil
2342 2018-12-18 20:37:30 ese 148 nao foi real, foi um overshoot ridiculo em 2008 numa mega speculacao de curto prazo (eu estava long oil e petr na epoca, entao obvio me convem oil na lua, mas o que tinha de gente "late to the oil parfty" em 2008 me lembra o povo de otubro este ano c/oil a 85 pedindo $100
2343 2018-12-18 20:37:29 I must do this ororo(oil), Sun and iPhone challenge  #glowing
2344 2018-12-18 20:37:21 Had to figure out how to turn off my oil change lights because the man who did my oil change didn’t reset it 
2345 2018-12-18 20:37:14 The whole reason *I* got a Twitter account was to stalk them while they were here in Louisiana for the oil spill 
2346 2018-12-18 20:37:14 Bio oil didn’t work for me at all! & I use that shea butter for pregnant women. Doesn’t really work for me :( & I drink lots of water. They kind of lightened up but they’re still red
2347 2018-12-18 20:37:11 I remind you that the oil sands were not feasible in the early days and at different times (including now), producers received government assistance and bailouts, including PET's help when Atlantic Richfield backed out of its 30% stake in Syncrude.
2348 2018-12-18 20:37:08 they remind me of that programme The Walking Dead with all the zombies.

2352 2018-12-18 20:37:01 I’m still teaching! I ready to sell snake oil. I’m a practioner. Come here mate
2353 2018-12-18 20:36:51 Sitting at jiffy lube getting my oil changed and this old bitch sitting next to me wont stop smacking her lips when shes chewing gum and I'm about to freak the fuck out
2354 2018-12-18 20:36:33 do you realize with nat gas inventories at a 5 year low heading into winter this collapse means a lot of oil rigs will be idled therefore less gas being produced. What will happen to nat gas pricing?  Don't be the next guy blown up like that guy that was selling naked calls.
2355 2018-12-18 20:36:28 Bullshit!
It's about Oil,$$$$$ & Control of the area.
2356 2018-12-18 20:36:24 Aramco, the world's largest oil company owned by the government of Saudi Arabia and/or the Saudi royal family, had a massive booth at last year's Detroit Auto Show. It planned to this year as well. Then Saudi Royal Prince ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
2357 2018-12-18 20:36:23 @CatherineBizTV is no journalist.

Of all the CEO's in the oil patch, she's interviewing Grant Fagerheim, again, to comment on today's Liberal announcement of an aid pckg to the #oilandgas industry. The small-cap Whitecap CEO was interviewed on @BNNBloomberg just 2 weeks ago  1/2
2358 2018-12-18 20:36:22 Lies all lies, remember an independent Scotland will make everyone oil rich millionaires just like Dynasty 
2359 2018-12-18 20:36:21 Grocery shopping and oil change Thursday
2360 2018-12-18 20:36:16 Pumped to go to the oil game tonight been a while since I have been to an @EdmontonOilers game at home
2361 2018-12-18 20:36:09 Thought I was having a rough day. 
Looked at the Crude Oil Chart.
Ya know. Life isn't too bad. 
#woof
2362 2018-12-18 20:35:57 Then beyond that i just got another good organic face wash to wash with regularly and new mascara, I use jojoba oil each night with a makeup wipe for my makeup remover! Hope this helps 
2363 2018-12-18 20:35:54 Add extra oil and water to compensate
2364 2018-12-18 20:35:50 Oh why do that when we can buy Saudi Arabian oil for 3x the price
2365 2018-12-18 20:35:49 フリーズの恩恵はソフトクリームへと変換されましたとさ...
2366 2018-12-18 20:35:48 Ah "confidence", the staple diet of the know-nothings who drank all the snake oil.
2367 2018-12-18 20:35:46 Er what...  unusual place for cod liver oil capsules.
2368 2018-12-18 20:35:37 It’ll take a lot more than that to get us out of oil haha
2369 2018-12-18 20:35:19 The more expensive oil is, the less people will use it. Carbon taxes are not material. You should hope oil goes to triple digits and stays there. That's why the Saudis were so worried when oil went to $140. At those levels, it would be too expensive to use.
2370 2018-12-18 20:35:11 Jamaican Castor Oil that is available at @Dischem and also @_BrothersBeard oil
2371 2018-12-18 20:35:10 no..bit...when the shorts come off...and you see their willys 
least I am honest.
2372 2018-12-18 20:34:47 I wasn't even thinking about burned, driven 12000 miles oil. I was thinking of that really deep yellow bordering on brown that shows dehydration (and looks like hematuria about half the time) lol
2373 2018-12-18 20:34:46 We are considered as a 3rd nation status (the same as Somalia, Honduras etc except they actually export)! Now we do trade on WTO just now but only oil, cars, pharmaceuticals and generators. Not exactly a great list... and only to China and USA.
2374 2018-12-18 20:34:36 FLODING OUR OIL FIELDS BUILDING FAITH AND CROSS AMERICA  TO JUST GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS AND TRUST ME IT FONT COME TO COURT IF SHE WANTS FREEDOM GUESS WHAT SHE GETS !!!
2375 2018-12-18 20:34:32 Why is there so many options for cooking oil????
2376 2018-12-18 20:34:31 I assume you mean local North Dakota prices, but on longer time frames where do you expect the most differential pain. Can Heavy oil trade at a premium?
2377 2018-12-18 20:34:28 Malignant narcissist Trump does not have empathy for human beings. If he was aware of the planned kidnapping of Guilan it would add a whole different dimension to the conspiracy charges. Same with Khashoggi and others.  Oil and real estate were common denominators also.
2378 2018-12-18 20:34:28 This lowkey sounds amazing, like imagine lucas oil is now tractor supply stadium, and they host the highschool fb “wing bowl”, “LIVE ON ESPN “THE TRACTOR SUPPLY WING BOWL” then the nfl theme plays
2379 2018-12-18 20:34:27 Not being funny but you can make those desserts yourself for about 3quid. Taste nicer and no palm oil. Wouldn’t take long either. Specially that Choux ring thing. Cost about £1.50 #howtospenditwellatchristmas
2380 2018-12-18 20:34:20 I'm aware that Norway's oil is a blot on Scandinavian pro-environmentalism and agree that carbon trading has been a huge disappointment, but my comment above still stands. @jmkorhonen  Your opinion?
2381 2018-12-18 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
2382 2018-12-18 20:34:08 Lavender really out here bein a color and an essential oil... damn !
2383 2018-12-18 20:34:07 ty might build it when the oil field booms again. just bought my first gun last month so im trying to cool it on my bank account
2384 2018-12-18 20:34:04 So much for Trudeau's promise to cut subsidies to profitable foreign oil / gas corporations! "Real change" eh? How does this square with COP24? #cdnpoli #bcpoli Even RBC report it is the global glut in supply. Liberals need to take Economics 101!
2385 2018-12-18 20:34:03 Miller had Giroux 2nd and McDavid 5th on his Hart Trophy ballot. That tells you all you need to know.
2386 2018-12-18 20:34:02 Question for the @federalreserve How inflationary is it if #oil only drops 8% in a day? It is only deflationary if it drops 10% right? #oott

Seriously how big a deflationary impulse is this dive going to push through the now world leader oil producer US economy?
2387 2018-12-18 20:34:01 I augment with salmon, salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic powder, onion flakes, and balsamic vinegar.
2388 2018-12-18 20:34:00 The US Courts will break FB up like Standard Oil or Bell Telephone. That's how these monopolies end up. Somebody is working on something.
2389 2018-12-18 20:33:58 $SPX $ES 
The last 30 point drop is tied to the decline in OIL which fell out of bed around 2:15 ish
2390 2018-12-18 20:33:55 Sorry about the oil price. Allah must have wanted it. Or the heavens hate your behaviour in #Yemen and even entertaining #Wahhabism as more than a nasty trick on mankind.
2391 2018-12-18 20:33:48 Look lady, telling an oil worker to find a "sustainable" job with reserves suffient for 5 more generations of workers is borderline retarded, that's why I went after you . I was in The alternative energy business (solar energy) for many years, attitudes like yours infuritate me.
2392 2018-12-18 20:33:47 #Ogoni rather. These cartel of thieves and oppressors were found guilty today in court on a 2.1 billion dollar scandal of oil blocks which also involves Nigerian crooks of politicians. #Shell destroyers of people's history values n lives
2393 2018-12-18 20:33:31 We know well how you test olive oil and honey and what are your standards and capacity 
A doctor showing concern on polio drops is enough for us to doubt your agenda!
2394 2018-12-18 20:33:21 This money is designed to get Alberta companies off oil. Nothing more.
2395 2018-12-18 20:33:15 well, I was thinking oil before you tip it into the engine. That should just mean you need to drink more water, before you start getting kidney stones. If your pee is the colour when you *drain* the oil, you're probably dead already!
2396 2018-12-18 20:33:15 Did you mean bite?
2397 2018-12-18 20:33:14 Because our oil is poor quality and expensive. 

Something something Fee Market something something
2398 2018-12-18 20:33:09 I need their tissue oil hey
2399 2018-12-18 20:32:54 Coconut oil is life 
2400 2018-12-18 20:32:52 My body oil is no match for this harmattan. God 'safe' my skin.
2401 2018-12-18 20:32:49 Here the british government (not the british people)  collides with the islamic Nigerian Government to kill biafran whom re dominately christians. They ve been killing us in thousands since 1952 and exploiting of our crude oil.
2402 2018-12-18 20:32:47 Bush should’ve also gone after Saudi Arabia who funded the terrorists, but because of his family’s oil company connections there, he didn’t.
2403 2018-12-18 20:32:44 I’m a bear, but other than a couple small hedges, I’m positioned long equities and adding more long positions in most everything except for energy.  Energy sector is just too scary for me, but will be a huge buy after oil tests $28 per barrel level.
2404 2018-12-18 20:32:40 Yep and he wanted to only sell oil for gold
2405 2018-12-18 20:32:30 This night alone someone drank my milk and used my oil. Honestly it's all these little little things.
2406 2018-12-18 20:32:28 And who exactly are they going to get it from? Better start begging oil shield and Europeans, this well is dry
2407 2018-12-18 20:32:10 i have CBD oil on my belly and it’s helping my cramps so much. praise jesus 
2408 2018-12-18 20:32:05 My head really be itching under these wigs I put oil on my hair damn near every day
2409 2018-12-18 20:31:46 We would rather haul oil just to piss people off. And make them upset and scared
2410 2018-12-18 20:31:45 $WFT .36- 1 of many I presume hanging by their nails in the oil patch...sub-50 getting more serious now if sustains
2411 2018-12-18 20:31:43 America ensures the sea lanes around the world stay open. China could cut u off, the strait of Hormuz could be cut off in ear between Iran-saudi Arabia without America ensuring open sea lanes, meaning u run out of oil quickly. Then need to fight China-japan-Korea-Taiwan for it.
2412 2018-12-18 20:31:43 Same here we haven’t done much since sir Alex left. We’ve had bunk coaches and players but ima still be repping them no matter what. And lol I’m just being realistic with pep as coach and endless oil money there gonna be fighting for silverware year and after year
2413 2018-12-18 20:31:38 Your tweet is seriously inaccurate: "The federal government is giving Alberta's energy sector a $1.6-billion boost"  From your own story: "Though MPs announced the boost in Alberta’s capital, oil and gas companies across the country are eligible for the funding..."
2414 2018-12-18 20:31:31 La demanda de oil para este año era supuesto crecer 2%... ha crecido 0.5%. Con el pressupuesto de los saudis hoy, quiere decir que tendran que bombear oil como locos....
2415 2018-12-18 20:31:26 When Alberta was swimming in petro-dollars, it was “ Screw you, Ottawa. Stay away from us and our oil. We need to separate from Canada.”
Now that the oil economy has dried up, the sounds of whining and crying from Alberta is deafening.
2416 2018-12-18 20:31:26 Same old Liberal propaganda... special interests, big oil, idiot Conservatives. I still am looking for that infamous hockey-stick chart. Nice try.
2417 2018-12-18 20:31:21 Someone remind trump, low oil prices hurt energy stocks. Energy stock pressure hurts Energy HY bonds. HY bond pressure hurts equities... #facepalm
2418 2018-12-18 20:31:12 Market so enthused with Trudeau non help to Oil and gas industry- that CAD is now about to break 1.35 .   on track to 1.37 still
2419 2018-12-18 20:31:12 ah yes baby oil, the most pro-life of the oils
2420 2018-12-18 20:30:58 $UGAZ this overblown move is a short play. Oil will come back up at some point as soon as whales have loaded long and are ready to create the move. Oil probably a good long-term investment down here.
2421 2018-12-18 20:30:56 i know and they said d.o needed to oil his joints amd i jokingly said "tell that to jin and namjoon" it was a complete joke and now everyone is telling me to unstan bts and calling me names haha
2422 2018-12-18 20:30:55 @realDonaldTrump you need to do something about the oil price.
This is not good for jobs.
2423 2018-12-18 20:30:54 Olive oil is clearly a woman. Come on.
2424 2018-12-18 20:30:53 Shout out to @SeanWSpoon56 for signing my @AtlantaFalcons flag after getting his oil changed at our shop. Damn good dude @putemupcdukes @MikeBellATL @MikeConti929 @squidbilly929
2425 2018-12-18 20:30:41 Oil will go below 20. 

It’s diplomacy, same as tariffs, but this one is to breakdown Russia.
2426 2018-12-18 20:30:32 So true; Druck made that very point about EM and EFA markets to economy relationships yesterday in a Bloomberg video. And what about Oil? Just crashing. Demand? Supply? Or both?
2427 2018-12-18 20:30:31 Hell yeah, and they charge $100 for that oil change too. I guess you gotta pay them that $25 and hour somehow....
2428 2018-12-18 20:30:31 What do you take? And what do you take it for.... I have anxiety and would like to try some CBD oil

Oil was baked into the 2014 White Paper numbers as admitted later by SNP. And anyway all geographical share is already reflected in GERS

So, in the real world, did you claim £200m and 18 months to set up iScot and rely on £8bn wrong revenue?
2432 2018-12-18 20:30:19 How much do you depend on your #car When was the last time you changed the oil?
2433 2018-12-18 20:30:14 yeah well you're trying to compare fish oil tablets that you buy at rite aid versus Crestor that you need a prescription for.

HUGE DIFFERENCE to the #CBD garbage you get at the corner and #Epidiolex by GW Pharma $GPWH that is prescribed by a doctor.
2434 2018-12-18 20:30:12 Oil Of Trump Skunk!
2435 2018-12-18 20:30:08 Or to the local oil depot or neighbour!
2436 2018-12-18 20:30:06 The oil & gas industry does not want or need handouts shouldered by the taxpayers. All we need are pipelines so we can get our products to market and get working! #BuildThosePipes #TransMountain #NorthernGateway #EagleSpirit #EnergyEast #cdnpoli
2437 2018-12-18 20:30:05 Break up Big Oil, and Big Coal as well
2438 2018-12-18 20:30:04 Hum Mon oil. Oui il n y a pas longtemps Martin Fayulu sans the cite t a traiter de voleur et he t assure que lorsqu il sera president il t enfoncera Dans l exile ouvre Les yeux papa tu es entourer des traitre qui ne sont que derriere l argent que tu as vole au katanga

2440 2018-12-18 20:29:55 tolong jual oil painting supplies :') uitm seri iskandar students would even go there to find oil paint in tubes. believe me. we've went to penang just to search for oil paint. im glad if you could supply those :)))
2441 2018-12-18 20:29:51 I can.  For centuries, currencies traded on BoP fundamentals & size of their FX rsvs; for the last 50 on int rate differentials. 

Rank the big 5 SDR currencies by BoP & FX rsvs & something interesting happens.  

Multi currency oil forces the world back to BoP-centric ccy system
2442 2018-12-18 20:29:48 Hi Kit. It's honestly not that bad.Yes it's noisy but you have headphones and can ask for music. I tended to drift off to sleep for mine. If you close your eyes you don't really know how narrow a space it is. At least you won't have cod liver oil capsules stuck on your nipples...
2443 2018-12-18 20:29:46 It's the most veg*n friendly of all fast food places. I can eat way more there than anywhere else lol. Even McDonald's uses beef in their frying oil
2444 2018-12-18 20:29:43 Tostones made with coconut oil>>>>>>>>>>>>
2445 2018-12-18 20:29:43 Los HY del oil están sufriendo que da gusto.
2446 2018-12-18 20:29:29 It makes no sense. Bill C-69 is designed to kill jobs and limit pipelines, and then they make loans to the oil companies to help find customers for the product going through the pipelines. Customers are already there - need to get product to market!!
2447 2018-12-18 20:29:28 We should should start seeing the effects in 2Q19. I expect oil cos to start the "lean" process after the holidays if the price remains as is or drops to minimize the impact on future profits. I miss those days and years as an analyst inside of one of the majors.  2015 sucked!
2448 2018-12-18 20:29:15 Mane I was in Oil Well, Ian even tryna fw highland lmaooo know they tweaking on that bihh
2449 2018-12-18 20:29:14 U are ~capable of patrolling your region, but u have nowhere near the ability to protect your oil shipments or your exports to and from far away nations without American assistance ensuring freedom of navigation. Won’t last unless a deal with USA is made. No deal, ur on ur own.
2450 2018-12-18 20:29:14 Unificated sudan is what !? - dust hhh , habub lol seriously ! No oil ! No gas just pure dust
2451 2018-12-18 20:28:37 OPEC's cut of 1.2 million bbls of oil daily will come from Saudi Arabia's output, which wants to use the revenue from resulting higher oil prices to balance its budget. That incentive overrode Donald Trump's plea to maintain production levels to keep prices low- The Economist
2452 2018-12-18 20:28:36 Of course not! Probably weighs half that. I never said that the Lincoln was inefficient, I'm sure it's a wonderful truck. 
It seems to ignore issues that are important, such as energy conservation, climate change, and more drilling for oil.
2453 2018-12-18 20:28:33 General problem I see its relentless, no bounces. Actually worse than most of bear markets. Traders not prepared for this, those who are short puts must be rolling all the time, giving it more pain. Whats more warning is oil - you dont 40 % haircut in 2,5 months for no reason.
2454 2018-12-18 20:28:32 Who needs an oil price chart when you can be guaranteed an update on andurands performance any minute now
2455 2018-12-18 20:28:26 Motor oil is good for ten years.
2456 2018-12-18 20:28:10 See slab for calculating inflation has changed as govt changed base year, logistics being transportation , though eway bill has provided some relief but prices of increasing oil, ngt orders etc have made it expensive, itc was there in vat act also, it’s either claim dep or itc
2457 2018-12-18 20:28:08 Exactly, the judgment which finds you guilty today on the #Malibu oil blocks 2.1 billion dollar scandal involving you (Shell), Eni and Dan Etete and a host of other Nigerian politicians. #Nigeria, a company of rogues owned by #Shell
2458 2018-12-18 20:28:05 The coconut oil butter? Yup Willy St.
2459 2018-12-18 20:27:54 My grandma came over to watch the kids so I could get my oil changed & grocery shop  She’s a saint.
2460 2018-12-18 20:27:47 Sharp fall in the price of oil pushing the Dow lower. Oil price now $46.50 and the Dow in negative territory. @TheBubbleBubble
2461 2018-12-18 20:27:40 Having univ age kids, I despair that many in their age group STILL sticking with pipelines-or-bust nrrtv, hoping to secure careers in big oil. It is heartening to see renewable programs offered in univs, cllgs thgh.

2465 2018-12-18 20:27:01 hi just want to make a quick suggestion!! I’ve been using the @lushcosmetics “Jason and the Argan Oil” shampoo bar for about a week now and absolutely love it!! smells great, makes my hair happy, and is environmentally friendly bc there’s absolutely no packaging!!!
2466 2018-12-18 20:27:01 How many know this fact? The White House granted waivers to eight countries — including Italy, Greece and Turkey — allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil for six months ending in early May.
2467 2018-12-18 20:26:58 experienced oil painters: remember to take breaks often and not to breathe in the paint fumes too heavily as it can damage your health!!!

me, with my face literally two inches away from the canvas going on three hours painting nonstop: ph my ghodd tgis is awsome
2468 2018-12-18 20:26:44 Just put a new tire on my car. Oil changed Sunday. Filled up the tank this morning and my damn transmission gone go out today
2469 2018-12-18 20:26:44 Oh Honeybathbody you make me so happy. This butter is seductive and intoxicating with its cocoa butter and bergamot scents. The healing properties of organic Shea Butter and coconut oil will certainly leave you feeling restored and smooth. #Honeybathandbody #completerestore
2470 2018-12-18 20:26:34 *grows a beard made of solidified oil* N-Nani?! XD
2471 2018-12-18 20:26:24 That tweet from Ricardo had the smell of sun tan oil all over it lol 
2472 2018-12-18 20:26:18 The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is heathy for my hair but breaking out my forehead.  #SensitiveSkinProblems KMT
2473 2018-12-18 20:26:17 It’s not a false narrative if it’s true. He is supported by big oil, that’s a fact. The majority of us are not interested, another fact.
2474 2018-12-18 20:26:11 I wouldn’t call it middle class oil workers make way more money than average person
2475 2018-12-18 20:26:09 You can't be against General Dynamics Canadian made LAVs and FOR Saudi oil over CDN oil ... in Canada ... yet Trudeau is proposing exactly that ... he's all about anti-CDN Globalist politics ... never ever takes a principled CDN position.
2476 2018-12-18 20:26:09 Government doesn't decide where refineries get their oil from and I don't think they should.  The energy companies are the ones who make that decision.  Government doesn't know enough about the industry to manage the oil markets.  That's not their job.
2477 2018-12-18 20:26:09 So the industry is killing the planet? You do  realize that a billion+ people burn oil every day. Who forced them to do that?
2478 2018-12-18 20:26:09 It’s ok because no one is paying to stop us from using Algerian oil
2479 2018-12-18 20:26:06 Get our oil to tidewater, cancel the eastern contracts for oil from countries like Saudi Arabia and Alberta will do quite well.
2480 2018-12-18 20:26:05 We existed but we lived in caves, straw huts. 
Research when oil was first discovered and how people lived back then. We had plagues and diseases. We have cures for most of them now because we developed tools to help us find cures.
2481 2018-12-18 20:26:05 Don't pee in the tank though. This causes problems with the engine. Don't pee in the oil either, even if your pee is the same color as the oil.
2482 2018-12-18 20:25:55 does anyone else remember when oil was $27 in 2016?  how about $10 and change in '98...
2483 2018-12-18 20:25:50 You have only half the oil in your veins now... we need liberation
2484 2018-12-18 20:25:47 My coconut oil has turned coconut candy... harmattan catch wereyy 
2485 2018-12-18 20:25:46 Used the clove oil a couple times earlier but doesn’t seem to be doing much .. it tastes so gross
2486 2018-12-18 20:25:33 @brussbowman got long USO into that puke. first long trade in oil in a very long time...
2487 2018-12-18 20:25:26 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @UPS @DHLUS @fedex with oil declining almost 40% in recent months why are shipping companies still charging "fuel surcharges" or is that just a fancy way to hide additional fees?
2488 2018-12-18 20:25:23 I just got tea tree oil in my eye & now I'm dying 
2489 2018-12-18 20:25:20 Massage your scalp with oil!
2490 2018-12-18 20:25:19 Use oil and set on sun light
2491 2018-12-18 20:25:18 Amazing on the collapse of oil ($WTI). Might be a good time to check $UWT and scrape some bottom calls/shares
2492 2018-12-18 20:25:00 MSG#2 access, how can we pay for the advancement of renewable technology, and innovations to replace petroleum related products that is found in every facet of our lives? You prefer to continue buying oil tanked over from Saudi to fuel the east as well? Cmon man..
2493 2018-12-18 20:24:52 Less than a week after Canada's Environment Minister returns from COP24 Canada announces $1.6B in new subsidies to oil and gas industries and yet @cathmckenna & @JustinTrudeau still call Canada a climate leader. I wonder how many Canadians believe them?
2494 2018-12-18 20:24:50 Oh you must got you a lil beard oil huh who is she
2495 2018-12-18 20:24:41 I am praying for Kim & you! So sorry about your cousin..holistic mesds have great success...cbd oil, baking soda etc..
2496 2018-12-18 20:24:29 Anyone knows where I can get some peppermint essential oil?
2497 2018-12-18 20:24:26 a conta sempre chega; they can play so much...tipo o povo que comprava petr adoidado sem prestar um pingo de atencao em  oil caindo 35%, e "apostando" na cessao onerosa, ou seja aposta na politica
2498 2018-12-18 20:24:16 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
2499 2018-12-18 20:24:14 Oil (WTI crude) was in the 50s when you took office.  It's now in the 40s. That's definitely not a good sign.  Maybe you should ask Rex what will happen to oil producers if the price of oil continues to drop. Ehhhh???? I can't hear you!!!
2500 2018-12-18 20:24:07 Just stopped buying Saudi oil!
2501 2018-12-18 20:24:06 If EVs ever take off, its inevitable I guess but it seems to be a paradox. 
Lower demand on oil, gasoline gets cheaper, demand goes up.
2502 2018-12-18 20:24:03 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with #Lavender #Oil.
2503 2018-12-18 20:24:03 Get an oil burner
2504 2018-12-18 20:24:03 Sohi is a complete liar. There is no other way to say it. He has promised, and promised and accomplished nothing. Zero.
Here, he is announcing help for the oil industry by providing money for anything but oil production.
He is a traitor to Alberta
2505 2018-12-18 20:23:48 an essential oil diffuser, the essential oils and a portable battery charger. Plus a big ass bag of snickers, but I gave it back lol
2506 2018-12-18 20:23:43 Its for government expenditures, not to be profitable on oil.
2507 2018-12-18 20:23:38 Cooking oil price if you dollarize is reasonable and comparable to the region. Our problem is the so called one to one.
2508 2018-12-18 20:23:38 Awkward .....It's unnecessary!!  
We do NOT need aid!!  
More demonising the oil & gas sector implying they need bailouts 
They do not
We need the government to GET OUT OF THE WAY!
2509 2018-12-18 20:23:26 why are the UK Government fast tracking the fracking , when Oil is at $49 a barrel , what bank is willing to prop up a loss making scheme like this 
Saudis produce a barrel for $5 
UK  produce barrel £90 pounds 
Looks like the tax payer is on the hook again 
how is that viable ?
2510 2018-12-18 20:23:24 #Colorado oil regulators approve wider buffers around schools, day care centers, six weeks after a statewide election to impose an even wider setback failed. Watch @EENewsUpdates for story. #fracking
2511 2018-12-18 20:23:12 That #ukog LSE board is an embarrassment to genuine holders.
2512 2018-12-18 20:22:52 nope. Time to invest in clean energy. No more bail outs for oil
2513 2018-12-18 20:22:49 Oil bye bye baby, baby bye bye.
2514 2018-12-18 20:22:43 Oil who
2515 2018-12-18 20:22:43 For Irving it's about diversifying their oil supply.  Besides, the east isn't able to process Alberta product and the Keystone pipleline made Energy East a non-starter.  Quebec doesn't even import Saudi Oil anymore.  They stopped almost a decade ago.
2516 2018-12-18 20:22:35 Wow this is like watching oil and water
2517 2018-12-18 20:22:33 The Office (the original), when Tim gives Dawn the oil paints and a note that says “Never give up.” Then she leaves her fiancée, returns to the office, and kisses Tim. Swoon!
2518 2018-12-18 20:22:31 There has not been nor will there be 1 oil industry representative to agree with what you are saying here. Not 1
2519 2018-12-18 20:22:28 No es rentable. El shale Oil rentable en estos precios es sólo en EEUU ya que no importan los insumos para la extracción. Acá bajan los márgenes de ganancias
2520 2018-12-18 20:22:27 copaiba oil for the win again 
2521 2018-12-18 20:22:23 Well, it'll be a bit dry, but if it's not too late you can add a tablespoon of veg oil to compensate.
2522 2018-12-18 20:22:18 I’m slicker than a can of oil
2523 2018-12-18 20:22:17 Great but the batteries degrade over time. This battery cost how much and when will it need replaced?  What if the garbage they pick up goes to an incinerator that produces electricity to charge these trucks? But all of this requires oil or natural Gas. In great quantities.
2524 2018-12-18 20:22:17 Gotta protect that oil exploration 
2525 2018-12-18 20:22:12 This past weekend cris broke my oil diffuser glass cap so I got some super glue and glued the pieces back together and I glued my fingers together in the process AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS. That shit hurted..don’t underestimate the power of super glue 
2526 2018-12-18 20:22:09 Eskis me? 28 gini? You dey mine crude oil?

2530 2018-12-18 20:22:01 After years of work, we have taken a step in protecting our health and safety by ensuring a further distance between oil and gas wells and our smallest residents. We passed #schoolsetbacks ! #COpolitics #oilandgas
2531 2018-12-18 20:21:57 Allow me: buy RSPO palm oil, otherwise they'll rip up the forest and plant something else instead.
2532 2018-12-18 20:21:51 The oil sands are one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters on the planet.  Millions.. billions of gallons of water are needed to extract the oil.  And finally total destruction of the forests.
2533 2018-12-18 20:21:50 Kkkkk pane mazilips like gaba re filter oil yemota
2534 2018-12-18 20:21:29 How in the hell does a husband kill his wife and two babies and throw them in an oil tank and not lose a minute of sleep over it?  #DrPhil
2535 2018-12-18 20:21:27 This is like that scene in Armageddon where Bruce Willis defends their oil mining by pointing out the activists protesting use gas as well.
2536 2018-12-18 20:21:23 Crude oil ….
2537 2018-12-18 20:21:18 You're funny. Core PCE brah, oil is to volatile to matter to those geniuses.
2538 2018-12-18 20:21:17 As the world's biggest producer of oil & other hydrocarbons...that's a tough balancing act for sure
2539 2018-12-18 20:21:14 Awesome Kenny! I just spent an hour making cookies when I see the oil I forgot to put in the first step. I had to trash them! 
2540 2018-12-18 20:21:13 Mom is taking CBD oil for her arthritis and has been telling her friends how well it works. Her knees don't ache anymore.

2545 2018-12-18 20:21:03 Why do the people who change my car's oil act like they're the police and they're giving me a warning just this once?
2546 2018-12-18 20:21:02 MSG#1 Are you daft? There should also be pipeline out east. Our dependence on oil can’t be phased out that quick. I’m all about renewable sources, but petroleum is a part of our everyday lives. From toothpaste to heating our homes. When the govt loses $50B a year due to no market
2547 2018-12-18 20:20:44 Dribble some oil on a spunge, every 5th-10th cut, coat the blade, no tears.
2548 2018-12-18 20:20:42 and to give him a rub down or just rub sun tan oil all over his hot cute smooooooth body......
2549 2018-12-18 20:20:33 I would say "tax loss selly" or "Algo'y" myself... sorta gets us to the same ultimate point.   I'm sure U remember OIL hitting $145+ in mid 2008 while the world was already starting to burn.  Oil has a funny way of being "extra strange"
2550 2018-12-18 20:20:27 Brilliant, but back in 20th Century UK, they tie hands & feet of solar & ev car manufactures. The industries now have no option but to leave. The UK has become a nature hating, climate change denying, basket case self obsessed with Brexit, oil & consumption. #Labour #Conservative
2551 2018-12-18 20:20:15 The ultimate sunk cost is an uninhabitable planet, but sure, the oil industry would be less rich.

The aristocrats!
2552 2018-12-18 20:20:11 That’s possible in an era of cheap capital, international supply chains and us navy subsidized sea lane protection for your oil and exports around the globe...won’t always be that way if America doesn’t ensure it’s posisble.
2553 2018-12-18 20:20:10 The death of Big Oil, in real-time 
2554 2018-12-18 20:20:08 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$3.35 or 5.6% to US$56.26 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$3.64 or 7.3% to US$46.24 a barrel.

2555 2018-12-18 20:20:01 I have not heard 1 oil industry expert opine about the Fed support, only conservative politicians have expressed negativity....and how do you know that there is not work going on behind your knowledge level re pipelines?
2556 2018-12-18 20:19:53 "Resource" sector. Can't even say the word oil. Disgusting PM.
2557 2018-12-18 20:19:48 Aye bit it would be oor oil........

(Don’t you dare mention BP/Shell etc etc, whose oil it actually is)
2558 2018-12-18 20:19:47 Fusion energy is about to crush oil so you need not worry about your Big MacOil boys know it and are ready to sale to the highest bidder Oil is  dead as Dinosaurs 
2559 2018-12-18 20:19:43 Venezuela was rich because of oil.  The Chinese are  the ones invading now, without firing a shot.  In some countries a little U$ goes a long way, but not most, it's a fluid situation, always has been.
2560 2018-12-18 20:19:42 Ni modo Daniel ...hace 2 meses esta lanzada en campaña . Y no considero el Antel Arena q se mando hacer . El Pais quedo sin Gas Oil ,las cosechas se pararon y la Candidata haciendo de Candidata

2573 2018-12-18 20:18:34 Might want the oil industry to clean up their area of business. It’s have a very negative effect on the environment
2574 2018-12-18 20:18:32 Maybe because CNBC usually seems to lean Pro-Trump but much less than FoxBusiness. I always thought she was slightly pro-Trump, but never seems to be pro-Dem, She is super smart about financial matters as are the others on the network. Rising Star
2575 2018-12-18 20:18:27 it’s not. beto broke a signed commitment to reject campaign donations over $200 from fossil fuel PACs and executives. of the $430,000 that his senate campaign received from individuals who work in the oil and gas industry, 75% came in the form of “large” donations over $200.
2576 2018-12-18 20:18:23 It’s appalling, but too easy for everyone to condemn this thing that most of us don’t want to do, while doing nothing about the stuff we’re all doing to wreck the world: palm oil consumption, plastics use, over-flying, etc. Mass extinctions will mostly be caused by the everyday.
2577 2018-12-18 20:18:18 How about using that money to retrain oil workers in solar, wind and other clean energy technologies and increasing funding to those industries. Time to phase out oil and move Alberta into green energy. They can still be leaders in energy production. #AlbertaProud
2578 2018-12-18 20:18:17 Get some tea tree oil, it will help.
2579 2018-12-18 20:18:10 As long as Mylan & Oil Companies keep our politicians rich! Who cares about us, am I right? 
2580 2018-12-18 20:18:09 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the bear market in stocks is partly and directly the results in the bear market in crude oil prices.

2583 2018-12-18 20:18:00 I can’t wait for car dealerships to go robotic/automated in their service department.  
Mechanics gotta take 3 smoke breaks, 2 coffee breaks, walking around to stretch out those hours, just do a simple oil change and led screen replace.

2585 2018-12-18 20:17:56 Cannabis saved my life when dr after dr wanted to prescribe me opioid after opioid for my fibromyalgia. It was hell to detox from the addiction Dr's caused but cannabis oil got me through it. With my mobility back I lost about 100lbs improving my pain even more
2586 2018-12-18 20:17:54 Thanks but not driving out of state for an oil change 
2587 2018-12-18 20:17:48 I’m so pissed now I prebought heating oil

Do you not actually understand how this works or are you just being deliberately dense, which seems to be a central tenement of conservatism these days? Stay retired. #Pipelines #cdnpoli @liberal_party
2593 2018-12-18 20:17:28 Yes. We have made aspirin (pretty standard prac), done some quick ester preps including oil of wintergreen and have nitration of methyl benzoate planned. The apprentices at uni have been honing their skills by running analysis on my pupils' aspiring samples too
2594 2018-12-18 20:17:26 Get a facial by me before I get graduated!! But if not I recommend the murad clarifying cleanser and their clay mask! Bomb af I use the cleanser everyday. And get some tea tree oil

2596 2018-12-18 20:17:22 Seriously, buy the $SPX dip. The $FED is going to hike, acknowledge tightening financial conditions, lower oil, and the overseas slowdown. It’s going to happen.

2598 2018-12-18 20:17:16 What a day guys ! 
I did not have a day like this for so long !! I left sooner because I finished my oil topic too fast 
Thank you !!!!
2599 2018-12-18 20:17:07 Probably got to be many sided. Raising awareness in the general public, raising the tax on plastic (for the packager not the purchaser - or maybe both!) I use solid shampoo bar ( comes in a cardboard box) and make toothpaste from coconut far and bicarb+ mint oil. Hard core me :)
2600 2018-12-18 20:17:00 Texas is getting a new Arena. 

They are 100% privately funding it. I need to find an oil Barron that will do that for #HawaiiAthletics
2601 2018-12-18 20:16:45 We've lost 10 times that in yearly investment. I can hear the morons now: "Durr whaddya mean they don't support the oil patch they gave them 1.6 billion"
2602 2018-12-18 20:16:39 Oil happened, down 8%... imagine if there were no Opec cuts...
2603 2018-12-18 20:16:37 @HouseDemocrats @MarcoRubio-Can you please explain this $1,000,000 contribution to your super PAC from a Russian billionaire who made billions off Russian oil? How many meetings did you have before you got this million dollar check? What did you offer in return?
2604 2018-12-18 20:16:35 The oil industry is going down. We need to start investing in alternative energy projects to replace those jobs when they start disappearing.
2605 2018-12-18 20:16:34 Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and China are all investing in oil alternatives. For Alberta to be less forward-thinking than any of those places would be embarrassing to say the least
2606 2018-12-18 20:16:18 The thousands of AB oil&gas workers gathering at rallies do not want gov't handing millions of tax$ to other gov't or quasi-gov't organization to pick winners & losers in the sector.

2623 2018-12-18 20:15:10 non-motorized, personal evaporative diffusers (necklace pendants, bracelets, etc.) that use room air currents to diffuse the aroma, and motorized diffusers that use a fan to blow air through a filter or pad that has been permeated with an essential oil. Hope that helps!
2624 2018-12-18 20:15:05 Its about the price of oil @jkenney which continues to fall. Oil’s analysts were predicting this would get worse for Alberta a year ago when over production had already created a glut that was pulling prices down farther. The industry itself, is its own worst enemy.
2625 2018-12-18 20:14:43 I don’t get how over nine years the rolling stock and bulstrode look spotless compared to Thomas and Edward who look they’ve scraped on the sidewalk then dipped in a bathtub of dirt and oil and rinsed off so slightly that you can still see marks of dirt and oil all over them

2633 2018-12-18 20:14:08 Most Canadians are fed up with welfare tax dollars forever going to #BigOil & #AB 
We subsidize the oil industry, we buy a pipeline, we continue unemployment benefits, now we GIVE yet again, more of OUR tax dollar to the crying child in the corner.#Cdnpoli
2634 2018-12-18 20:14:06 That said, I’m sure IRL most folks attending these protests aren’t even on twitter. They’re our neighbours with oil industry jobs and concerns about carbon taxes.
2635 2018-12-18 20:14:03 Wait, do you not think the oil and gas industry is propped up by government subsidies? It is. Renewable energy employs a ton of people now and that is only going to grow and grow, as jobs in dirty energy decline. We should get in front of this now.
2636 2018-12-18 20:13:46 Big oil bailout.
2637 2018-12-18 20:13:45 Yes, it's true. 12 years ago @WCELaw had a grant from the Rockefeller Brothers and @FairQuestions is still milking it. #oldnews Hey, Vivian, can you tell us how much U.S. investment there is in the Oil Sands? #cdnpoli #abpoli
2638 2018-12-18 20:13:45 Great. I’m in my car dealership getting an oil change cry-laughing and everyone is looking at me.
2639 2018-12-18 20:13:42 No, that is when the shorts come off. 
That is the bit I am looking forward to.

2647 2018-12-18 20:13:11 Peter also called for $80 oil by the end of the year we'll see if it happens. In addition I think we're going to have a huge rally in the near term.

2649 2018-12-18 20:13:04 Ah, "confidence", easy to take to the bank.

The truth is "confidence" is all you have, in the absence of evidence for & tons against, it's all you're left with.

We have to have "confidence" (or "belief") in Brexit !

No wonder you lot fell for the snake oil salesmen.
2650 2018-12-18 20:13:03 Oh no,no, no.  Cheese is a protein and can ball up in the stomach.  That's why when you eat fondue, you need tea or wine (tannins) to break it up.
Try some coconut oil to help "slick" the pipes, so to speak.

2656 2018-12-18 20:12:48 Excuse me but it is now 2018 & there is a MASUIVE amount of Oil being harvested. Seems someone got their calculations wrong & there is MILLIONS of pounds worth of the stuff? Strange that eh?
2657 2018-12-18 20:12:43 I’m not from Alberta. All oil is dirty in case you weren’t aware. Also of course it’s their money that doesn’t mean it doesn’t it doesn’t the rest of the country by it being refined here and sold globally at a higher rate than the Americans pay for it currently.
2658 2018-12-18 20:12:38 It’s not about oil
Only a little of price discovery
2659 2018-12-18 20:12:32 Somebody is playing a game on the market..any research done on who or which fund is going short? There is room for manipulation on market as fundamentals are slightly bullish..in 6 months of this..prices up 4sure while investments are way behind aka additional oil also soon!
2660 2018-12-18 20:12:30 Do you have any clove oil? That helps, although it tastes like shit. Or tramadol

2662 2018-12-18 20:12:19 Wait, humans didn't exist before oil we used oil? Interesting take on life I guess, rather flawed if you ask me and very defeatist. I guess we have to keep taking all the oil out and destroy human existence!

2675 2018-12-18 20:11:27 One big reason is protectionism by US government, especially, against Chinese Cos... made worse by strong dollar and European political problems.... now oil going down too. One thing i can say, its time for Pakistan to buy long term LNG at fixed prices and hedge it.
2676 2018-12-18 20:11:17 infact with cheaper oil no other option will get power.. for bye bye oil, ou need higher oil prices not lower. simple market rules
2677 2018-12-18 20:11:12 They were trying to wax your car with engine oil. Give them some credit
2678 2018-12-18 20:11:12 ^that was for face
For even tone and glow I mix different oils and lotions 
-Coconut Oil
-Red Fox cocoa butter
-Shea Butter
-olive oil: I know it sounds weird but great 4 keeping skin mosturized
-a little tea tree oil
-unscented eucerin cream 
Mix all that together, thank me l8tr

2682 2018-12-18 20:11:07 Did you know you can boil an egg in oil and you can also fry an egg in water, so in a way boiling and frying an egg are sorta the same thing
2683 2018-12-18 20:11:03 @IcelandFoods great you no longer use palm oil but maybe you could stop the caged hens eggs too?
2684 2018-12-18 20:11:03 Coconut oil Gabe at it again!
2685 2018-12-18 20:10:48 Thx. Scientifically speaking at the BTU arb gap between Gas/Oil their should be some firm support around $25 WTI. We'll just start throwing crude in the furnace to keep our homes warm. I'm more negative on the credits than I am on the commodity. The curve went into contango again
2686 2018-12-18 20:10:48 I used to do this for my kids and now my grandkids. Rub his tummy with olive oil in the morning. Before he eats give him camomile tea and a tee spoon of olive oil. It’s an old Mexican remedy but it works. 
2687 2018-12-18 20:10:45 Drink water, aloe vera gel is also good wa i sometimes use light oils at night for better moisturizing effect as jojoba oil,grapeseed, sweetalmond oil
2688 2018-12-18 20:10:29 Oil has gone from $76 to $46 in the last 7 wks, a drop of 40%. 90% of Russia's exports were from oil/gas prior to the recent price plunge. Russians will suffer, as will Maduro's & Iran's, though the people's ability to tolerate such poor governance never ceases to amaze.

2693 2018-12-18 20:10:06 JustinTrudeau: RT SohiAmarjeet: Thread (1/13): Canada’s energy sector, including Alberta’s oil and gas industry, is a source of well-paying middle class…
2694 2018-12-18 20:10:05 How to fix car issues---like oil change--fluids check etc---Everybody...xoxo
2695 2018-12-18 20:10:03 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
2696 2018-12-18 20:10:03 Biased MSM is not publishing on #Kashmir #Yemen and #Somalia - Silent genocides are taking place, nobody is hearing their scream. Why? Because there's no oil involved for the West. Worlds going to pay a heavy price for keeping silent... #FreeKashmir
2697 2018-12-18 20:09:54 As you see chris,
This is legendary and you can not see in gym or nature. So seen=pass. Take care and drink fish oil every day.
2698 2018-12-18 20:09:53 This hour wait for an oil change has me reading about the Alcatraz prison escape
2699 2018-12-18 20:09:53 WTI #oil now $45.95, off by - 7.88%
2700 2018-12-18 20:09:52 i used to work at a mcdonald’s drive thru and someone dumped vat oil in the sink it was gross and i accidentally touched it, which caused me to shriek like little girl while i was taking an order. the customer was my therapist. that was our topic of discussion next meeting m
2701 2018-12-18 20:09:51 This is totally false and so misleading. I lived in a neighborhood where 75% work for oil and gas. Many supported Beto and donated to him individually and recorded what industry they worked for!!!! Energy is a huge employer in Texas.
2702 2018-12-18 20:09:39 I think the science is out there that confirms oil and gas are most definitely not our future.  Why not actually invest in our future by NOT promoting something that is killing the planet.
2703 2018-12-18 20:09:38 One of the best GS leaders in my area- Mark, father of 2 girls. His girls in his troop all got long stem roses for their birthdays, he had them all learn how to change a tire, oil and filters. He made sure the bar was set so high no scum could walk into their lives. Good job!
2704 2018-12-18 20:09:33 String sherry influence mingled with pot still spice. Candied orange peel, sweet raisins, muscavado sugar syrup, clove oil and toasted oak. Belter of a nose! #SonnyRB
2705 2018-12-18 20:09:24 US Crude oil is now down over 13% in the past 3 days
2706 2018-12-18 20:09:22 Was Obama giving Brazil $2B for oil exploration moral?  Is the $500M given to abortion provider  PP is moral?
2707 2018-12-18 20:09:17 Yo lemme know how I'm gonna spend a useless amount of time to shave and oil my legs and they gonna decide to get goosebumps on me. Wow. What fake ass legs.
2708 2018-12-18 20:09:14 I need to take my moms car to get an oil change in 20 minutes but I don’t wanna take off my onesie and put real clothes on 
2709 2018-12-18 20:09:07 Crude oil plunges as much as 8 percent to just under US$46 a barrel - growing concerns about a global slowdown if US China trade tensions flare, outlook for a US recession, US rates likely to move higher tomorrow @abcnews #AusBiz
2710 2018-12-18 20:09:06 @vegastbone wow oil just dipped below $46 down another 7% today 
45.97-3.91 (-7.84%)
2711 2018-12-18 20:08:58 The cheaper oil gets, the less attractive renewables are. You should hope for $200 oil if you want hydrogen to catch on.
2712 2018-12-18 20:08:58 Oil chaos coming to equities?
2713 2018-12-18 20:08:44 Disagree, strongly.  CNY oil contract success means BoP risks for China receding rapidly.  China’s non-commodity goods trade surplus is $700B.  Means China has leeway to allow CNY to rise without creating risk to debt sustainability
2714 2018-12-18 20:08:41 MP: Get back to Skye
IB: Ok cool.
MP: But keep sending oil money and don’t start breaking up the estates. 
IB: *whistles* 
MP: How’s trident?
2715 2018-12-18 20:08:36 Oil vol up to 3%/day.  Seems rich right?  Until you realize that today’s move paid for 8 days of time decay.  Options all about the tails.
2716 2018-12-18 20:08:34 #UKOG LSE. With High court injunctions stopping swampies illegal activities at oil sites it's no wonder they infest the UKOG BB  .

I do laugh at all their pathetic scare mongering and slander . They also hate anyone with a few quid more than them. Same names every day .
2717 2018-12-18 20:08:18 The payment is so during the next election Trudeau can say to the ROC, “Ignore the whining in Alberta, I wrote them cheques.” 

Trudeau is just not listening. ALBERTANS DON’T WANT HANDOUTS OR GOV OWNERSHIP OF PIPELINES. WE WANT ACCESS TO TIDEWATER TO EXPORT OIL.
2718 2018-12-18 20:08:15 If the government cared about world pollution they would stop using other countries oil and use more canadian oil to lower world carbon footprint.  Canada would also benefit from the sale of excess oil to other countries like India. Easy to go across the Atlantic Ocean.
2719 2018-12-18 20:08:14 I stopped eating salmon, taking fish oil. Go easy on other fish also.
2720 2018-12-18 20:08:14 or course it does - they didnt buy us - we didnn't marry them......its trading agreement.  We have a right to dissolve it.......as they do too.   What them dissolve it when OIl RUNS out.
2721 2018-12-18 20:08:13 Tariff man wants tariff. He got it and  stocks are tanking.

Tariff man wants lower oil price.
 He got it and stocks are tanking. 

Congrats on Tariff man. 

@realDonaldTrump 

Go bank to Wharton.
2722 2018-12-18 20:08:10 Todo menos Petróleo, en ese caso podemos hacer alianzas con empresas privadas como SHELL CHEVRON o con empresas estatales como Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC)
2723 2018-12-18 20:08:07 Your head get better oil bro
2724 2018-12-18 20:08:00 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
2725 2018-12-18 20:07:59 Wall Street not buying all the fake promises by the Twitter President.  Oil, China deal, not to mention the unstable genius' situation regarding his legal matters as a unindicted co-conspirator.
2726 2018-12-18 20:07:59 Wow! Crude oil has dropped 8% so far today. to $46 per bbl. That is panic selling. Ramifications in the oil patch? Chrismas bonus for drivers?
2727 2018-12-18 20:07:46 Interesting read...just one thing...pls show the scales on which crude price and petrol and diesel prices are shown. Here crude oil is in $/bbl and petrol/diesel price is in ₹/Ltr.
2728 2018-12-18 20:07:45 Reminder: the Arabs invaded and took over the whole of the eastern and southern Roman Empire and lived off the loot for centuries. Now they've got hold of new loot: Oil & the Neo-Left.
2729 2018-12-18 20:07:43 Maybe we just saw the final move up before the 1987 style crash analog. Powell can stammer along tomorrow while Spoos is limit down, I think. Especially with Oil being down (again) by a staggering 6%, this looks like a deflationary crash in the making.
2730 2018-12-18 20:07:40 Add peanut butter. Reduce the oil (or fat) of the bread component by half of the amount of PB you add - so if you add 2 TBSP of PB, reduce the oil (or butter or bacon grease or whatever) by 1 TBSP.
2731 2018-12-18 20:07:40 I don't do much real world shopping anymore (plus my family are just doing charitable donations this year) but I still wound up sending myself a Lush package with face oil, bath bombs and lord of misrule perfume oil... oh god everything smells so good right now I regret nothing
2732 2018-12-18 20:07:16 A spoonful of olive oil always helped my kids
2733 2018-12-18 20:07:14 Crude Oil/dragged /support 
2734 2018-12-18 20:07:10 Try frying them in extra virgin olive oil with a whole garlic clove, chili and then add roasted pine nuts or crumbled pistachios.
2735 2018-12-18 20:07:04 Do you put crude oil in your bike or petrol?
2736 2018-12-18 20:07:01 Hittin that peppermint essential oil like poppers. 
2737 2018-12-18 20:06:56 Haven’t seen What oil your cooking it in yet? Knowing you it could be Castrol R 
2738 2018-12-18 20:06:54 Lets go get matching oil changes
2739 2018-12-18 20:06:51 The red oil part made him sound like a deity
2740 2018-12-18 20:06:46 A speedo and a light coat of oil for casual Fridays I hear.
2741 2018-12-18 20:06:37 Good news! Maybe Acacia Avenue from City Oil to the Golf Club will finally get smooth.
2742 2018-12-18 20:06:35 My libertarian colony on the oil platform for construction workers of the underwater colony has devolved into warlordism. Construction is delayed.
2743 2018-12-18 20:06:06 Things that will help our planet. If you hadn’t noticed we all have to share the same one
1. Buy a water filter avoid plastic bottles
2. Don’t buy products containing palm oil 
3. Try to cut down or cut out totally meat, fish and diary

Easy.frikin.peasy. 
2744 2018-12-18 20:06:05 Anytime you need water or oil Kate we can help 
2745 2018-12-18 20:06:01 I guess they don't seem to understand that oil brings millions$$ to Canadian economy instead of sending millions$$ to human rights denial and dictatorial countries!! They prefer to borrow millions$$ and create big big deficits! that's the real legacy we are leaving to our kids!!
2746 2018-12-18 20:06:01 why my dog likes to roll around under my lowered truck? I have no clue but what I do know is she’s the cutest covered in motor oil
2747 2018-12-18 20:06:01 Church & State (AKA government) DO.NOT.MIX. Think of them as OIL & WATER. Church being the oil, because it’s slippery & very hard to grasp (because it’s slippery) & government as wa... Wait. They’re both like oil. OK, maybe like Motor Oil & Olive Oil... NOT good together. 
2748 2018-12-18 20:05:58 Couldn’t resist taking a nibble here in crude.. sue me #oott #oil
2749 2018-12-18 20:05:56 rose oil has been treating my skin well 
2750 2018-12-18 20:05:54 Crude oil down to 46.3! This is really fun to watch.
2751 2018-12-18 20:05:53 WTI Crude at $45.95, -3.93.  A complete reversal from 2017/2018 rally.  What is oil, and rest of metals, trying to tell us?
2752 2018-12-18 20:05:50 You can go play with somebody else cause nigga you can’t slick a can of oil.

2755 2018-12-18 20:05:41 Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings
2756 2018-12-18 20:05:39 I bathe in pure CBD oil now, so I can relate
2757 2018-12-18 20:05:10 I do. We pay too much in tax. I’m sorry I’m picking on oil today but generally speaking I’m just fed up with the government.  Not Liberals specifically. ALL parties. They use our hard earned money to buy votes and I’m tired of it. 
2758 2018-12-18 20:05:02 me rubbing body oil on myself after my shower
2759 2018-12-18 20:04:58 Sophie - OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES
2760 2018-12-18 20:04:57 ya girl is out here getting her oil changed and tires rotated 
2761 2018-12-18 20:04:51 yup respect the fact the troops are invading countries and killing  for the elite bankers .. GOD Gold Oil Drugs.
2762 2018-12-18 20:04:47 The collapse in oil price is really getting out of any reasonable proportions .. down today like 4 usd ... if not buying outright soon, selling otm puts seems like a great idea .. the price is not going to zero, like bitcoin could do at least in theory ...
2763 2018-12-18 20:04:45 Homemade Bran muffins, sometimes with blueberries or banana. Oatmeal, nuts, honey. More fruits.  Cook light. Side salad, dressing made with virgin olive oil n spices.  More fish n chicken, less beef.
2764 2018-12-18 20:04:44 Well, yeah, Beto supported oil & off-shore fracking in Texas over import from Saudi Arabia, a logic that likely echoed with Texans but will not work for a sustainable future that requires bold actions to turn away from fossil fuels.
2765 2018-12-18 20:04:43 Blitz it with olive oil and freeze in ice cube tray.
2766 2018-12-18 20:04:40 @rodgertq Unexpected problems. My daughter can't stand the smell of the oil on the rosewood handles for the new knives. I told her I can use a different oil as this one wears off :}
2767 2018-12-18 20:04:33 Whoa and crude oil is tanking, hard!
2768 2018-12-18 20:04:31 Oil and gas sector strange, economically. Normally, when producers create too much product for a system, prices drop until the surplus clears. But not the energy sector. They expect governments to solve their problems by building free pipelines to pretend markets. Odd buggers.
2769 2018-12-18 20:04:25 Wya? Getting an oil change rn :/
2770 2018-12-18 20:04:24 need to get my oil changed..
2771 2018-12-18 20:04:19 Maybe I didn't get the memo but since when is cheap oil and getting money in form of interest on your savings accounts bad? Loving life here
2772 2018-12-18 20:04:10 Before another Davos, oil is declining again.

2775 2018-12-18 20:04:07 Might sound cryptic to you, but I can buy olive oil again.
2776 2018-12-18 20:04:06 That's like saying open movement of labor would work if not for the existence of the welfare state.
2777 2018-12-18 20:04:05 basically it's just a lot of tea tree oil.
2778 2018-12-18 20:03:59 You think oil and gas executives preferred a Democrat over Cruz? This is silly. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs in those industries here in Texas and even gas station employees are considered oil and gas employees. Where is your proof?

2781 2018-12-18 20:03:46 At least they didn't drink the oil, be glad.
2782 2018-12-18 20:03:36 NLP is the new oil. I mean, China.
2783 2018-12-18 20:03:30 Any oil company is going to buy the cheaper choice. Right now east coast has no choice. Canadian oil is some of the cleanest oil produced. Not to mention that we have the highest safety and environmental standards in the world. And lower carbon footprint to produce oil.
2784 2018-12-18 20:03:23 I need to up my desire game, all I want is coffee which does not taste like ground gravel which has been roasted in motor oil. I could only drink one pot of that foul stuff today.

2787 2018-12-18 20:03:21 “Please lord give us another oil boom and we promise not to piss this one up against the wall”.   Poor management is NOT my problem.
2788 2018-12-18 20:03:20 Keep you eye on $DAL as oil continues to fall.  This will be a catalyst to a positive earnings update.  I doubt it will come in any further, but if the market were to have a mental breakdown & it heads to the $49 dollar level, I would back up the truck. Excellence in Execution!
2789 2018-12-18 20:03:20 Fijate lo que en 2018 está haciendo el oil.....
2790 2018-12-18 20:03:14 A $100 oil change wtf  I could’ve done that shit BY MYSELF FOR $50!!!!!! 
2791 2018-12-18 20:03:08 You crossed my mind a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
2792 2018-12-18 20:03:02 The best days to destroy oil remain Monday & Tuesday.

2794 2018-12-18 20:02:59 Poor Alberta contributing to Canada as part of this great nation just like BC. Etc.  Your being duped since birth by big oil and now their latest puppet kenney is whipping up the garbage for them. Wake up
2795 2018-12-18 20:02:56 No.  #1, he promised, endlessly, that Mexico would pay for the wall. Until then, we don't even consider a wall. #2, a wall /= border security. That is a fiction. We don't allow the president to sell snake oil to the ignorant.  We did it with the "tax cut."  No more!!
2796 2018-12-18 20:02:36 Sir name of the App ur using to watch crude oil price
2797 2018-12-18 20:02:35 If raising beacoup bucks from hedge funds and oil companies is considered good, then Beto is king.
2798 2018-12-18 20:02:35 You actually posted that. How naive are you? See ULA, Tesla, Tucker. Big Oil, Big Pharma,  eminent domain for big companies to steal property from small businesses. Save the free market stuff for someone that doesn't know better.
2799 2018-12-18 20:02:29 The issue is getting way more product to market & more money for that same product.  The oil hasn't stop running though thousands of pipelines 24/7. The problem isn't Ottawa. It's about Trump policies world markets & endless  delays by the courts.
2800 2018-12-18 20:02:27 Ed - what turns “good objective advice on high stakes judgements” into “snake oil.”?
2801 2018-12-18 20:02:20 using homemade deodorant and hair oil has me on that other shit. you're not like me. 
2802 2018-12-18 20:02:16 Ladies and gentlemen, how about a round of applause for the philanthropic shareholders, managers and employees of the companies producing oil in the Permian basin of West Texas!

Seems to clear to markets that these folks will donate oil below cost to the rest of you forever!!
2803 2018-12-18 20:02:16 And a high level of built-in inertia when it comes to reacting to change. As witness by the partisan advice given by their oil and gas unit which, it is now clear, was in the pockets of the industry. May have been appropriate under the previous government, not now.
2804 2018-12-18 20:02:08 The end is near
2805 2018-12-18 20:02:08 Amen! Lost my gob l job to oil workers when oil crashed 2014. Apparently skilled labor such as myself are neonazi's. Because we dared question and criticize the situation and govenment involved. 

Fuck this time line. People are going to start getting their skulls cracked
2806 2018-12-18 20:01:56 Everything is ending... What's going on?
2807 2018-12-18 20:01:50 This scale is not even there JT what about the east coast and the unserten economic future Saudi oil is on a time line on the east coast as well. You intend on distorting western Canada. But you put the stick in the eye across Canada . To please your agenda.
2808 2018-12-18 20:01:48 Cod liver oil. But hold your nose
2809 2018-12-18 20:01:42 Saudi king extends allowances as biggest budget ever is announced. With only oil to depend on hopefully it will soon run out and Saudi will be on its knees and begging
2810 2018-12-18 20:01:36 Interior Secretary Ryan Zeinke

his corruption led to scandal that was ot kinky
rather than face questions he left town like a slinky

2817 2018-12-18 20:01:00 What happened to you? Literally my favourite Dragon back in the day. Now just anger. No one is rooting for Alberta to fail! Shouldn't the oil industry be able to operate without the $1.6 billion in subsidies announced today? #renewableenergy
2818 2018-12-18 20:01:00 oil
2819 2018-12-18 20:00:59 That oil and healthcare though 
2820 2018-12-18 20:00:57 Oil is down almost 8 percent. That is a collapse of epic proportions. Either the economy globally is going south, or they just found a ton of new oil supply!
2821 2018-12-18 20:00:51 She violated her oath of office to Protect and Defend. She let American Heroes die at the hands of a brutal enemy. She, Rice, and very possibly with the consultation of Obama and his team and her operatives created a false narrative with a video and lied to the American citizens.
2822 2018-12-18 20:00:46 Mean while, our Nigeria  witnessed oil boom and a whole loots more......only to be squandered and looted thereafter.
2823 2018-12-18 20:00:44 #oil $wtiu I sold all my stocks and put 100% of my portfolio in 3x long oil etf. I can’t say it won’t go lower but WTI will be materially higher in next few months, maybe post Fed meeting. I’d normally buy calls/spreads but am willing to give up liquidity for this trade.
2824 2018-12-18 20:00:44 They want the opposite, for the Liberals to get out of their lives and let them get their oil to markets. Liberals and leftists are the problem. The protests are a big F you and get out of our way. Albertans are not parasites like Easteners!
2825 2018-12-18 20:00:37 Wow. Wish we had had this info. 15 months ago.  It may not have gotten Hillary elected( Should have) but there were other Republican continders on that stage that could have made it through 2 fucking days without so much drama. I mean..even Rudy...no screw that snake oil seller..

2827 2018-12-18 20:00:36 Literally days after #COP24, Canada announces 1.6B in aid to oil and gas companies? Total hypocrisy.
2828 2018-12-18 20:00:34 except we don't primarily import oil from Saudi Arabia, we import it from the US, except that Trudeau has basically the same tepid plan for climate change that Harper did, and except that Harper's government inked an arms deal with Saudi Arabia - so much hypocrisy

2830 2018-12-18 20:00:32 I got some black truffles in oil.  I think morels taste better than truffles actually.  You should try black garlic.  Those, mushrooms and butter would be a sublime trinity.
2831 2018-12-18 20:00:32 Trudeau made an 2015 election promise to cancel billions in subsidies to the oil and gas industries. He broke this promise and instead keeps increasing subsidies and growing Canada's national debt (which is another broken election promise).
2832 2018-12-18 20:00:30 They were saying $90 oil...$45 & change today. They were also saying $SPX crash.
2833 2018-12-18 20:00:25 What the oil? Lol
2834 2018-12-18 20:00:20 Caprese;
Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2835 2018-12-18 20:00:20 My dudes I am struggling today. I can’t wait to have health insurance bc cramps this bad cannot be normal. I have so much on my to do list but every time I stand up it’s immediately so much pain. Gonna probably pick up some cbd oil later so here’s to hoping that helps 
2836 2018-12-18 20:00:17 City playing good but their fans chanting "Bring Back Mourinho" will always be in our shadows..fans bought by oil money #moneycannotbuyclass #LeiMci
2837 2018-12-18 20:00:17 La petroleras argentinas de bajar precio combustibles ni hablar no ?

digo porque el oil no para de bajar...
2838 2018-12-18 20:00:12 Welcome to Canada! Hatred of French Canada still present and alive. Quebec dairy farmers sold out by Canada in the NAFTA renegotiation for what?? The automotive sector in Ontario? GM has left and will not return. For dirty oil pipelines? Sovereignty is starting to look good.
2839 2018-12-18 20:00:11 This Trader Joe’s olive oil popcorn might be the best popcorn to have hit my mouth
2840 2018-12-18 20:00:06 The same case could be made for neighboring New Mexico, flush in oil money currently, and likely for most every state in regard to progressive issues. All Democrats voted for the Defense budget of THIS administration! Imagine what all that money could do for us in the US.

2842 2018-12-18 20:00:02 the only reason trump wants oil prices lower is so he can raise the federal gas tax to fund an infrastructure bill
2843 2018-12-18 20:00:02 My daughter has been on epelim too but it didn’t work for her and yeah the vigabatrin and steroids didn’t either for my girl. I’ve heard the keto diet works quite well, also have you tried CBD oil? X
2844 2018-12-18 19:59:56 Just looking at the charts, if Oil fails to hold $42 its going right back to $26
2845 2018-12-18 19:59:31 Silly words, in truth. When an economy leans predominantly on a diminishing resource, diversification is the wise play. He's correct insofar that demand is growing, but the US Bakken play has changed all the rules. It'll get worse the US gets into developing arctic oil, too.
2846 2018-12-18 19:59:30 Spectacular collapse in oil price. There's nowhere to hide in this market. Unless you're short.
2847 2018-12-18 19:59:28 What a loser, JT is more like Trump's whipping boy and this thing with him getting involved in the US/China trade war is like economic shot in the chest. Politicians are puppets of multinational corporations (banks, big oil etc), voting is a scam, people wake up!!
2848 2018-12-18 19:59:27 Don't forget your 10 foot pole!  Just, maybe leave the flasks of oil at home.
2849 2018-12-18 19:59:27 How about we stop buying oil?
2850 2018-12-18 19:59:26 The Oil Panic out of Fire Fighter combo never fails, ever, and it always turns ou twell fo rme
2851 2018-12-18 19:59:24 $USDCAD expensive at these levels...yeh yeh $OIL flushing, but this is an overshoot. Im taking a starter in 1.3490s risk 1.3550. Can easily see <1.3400 in the short term #forex #trading
2852 2018-12-18 19:59:18 oil -> regional banks -> money center banks
2853 2018-12-18 19:59:17 That oil 
2854 2018-12-18 19:59:17 Why would she fight wealthy landowners in Mississippi to protect our Lower Pearl River? She went to war with them - and the principle in charge is a big oil man.  You make too many assumptions about why people do things.

2856 2018-12-18 19:59:07 Tonight, a shoutout to the middle aged men at the restaurant table next to ours talking loudly about how they would like to "massage a female body and oil down her cunt," ruining my entire dinner
2857 2018-12-18 19:59:01 Yessir ... Only my south people understand the importance of oil like that to liken it affectionately to a woman
2858 2018-12-18 19:58:58 @fordnation the canadian way:dilly dally shoulda coulda maybe woulda 15 years later still waiting for oil and gas prices to go up save the entire country from broke..poorly poorly run..have nothing more than oil?  my god what a joke
2859 2018-12-18 19:58:47 Oil changed, tire rotation, full tank, and it’s clean and smelling good
2860 2018-12-18 19:58:44 No panic attacks since I started using CBD Oil. Finally able to rest at night.  #HempHealth #Sleep #Combatanxiety

2862 2018-12-18 19:58:40 Today mid oil change I was tearing up cause my great grandmas healthy is slowly going downhill. And reality is kinda setting in that she really doesnt have a whole lot of time left. She’s the one person that taught me to smile through all the bullshit.
2863 2018-12-18 19:58:38 Can we get an OIL IN TURMOIL show tonight on @CNBC ??? #OOTT
2864 2018-12-18 19:58:33 @connellmcshane Oil going into the 30's, equities have a lot more room on the downside. This is not algo traders this is individuals panicking. HFT trading is just an excuse
2865 2018-12-18 19:58:33 While the feds are bailing out the oil companies why not toss some coin to hydro1 and the insurance companies just to make it fare...
2866 2018-12-18 19:58:27 @aboutpipelines @canolacouncil 
How about building a pipeline to move canola oil to port?
2867 2018-12-18 19:58:27 You wey senate sabi. 

Oil money .

Tuale baba
2868 2018-12-18 19:58:22 Crude oil is down 40% since its peak made on 3rd Oct...effect on retail prices in India? Oh yea chaddis will get more toilets
2869 2018-12-18 19:58:11 Guess $ET is trying for a straight 10% yield...1.7x coverage last quarter, even with some kind of envisioned slowdown in oil and gas output growth, hard to see less than 1.5x. Wild times in #oil land that for sure #oott
2870 2018-12-18 19:58:06 Installing renewables will not eliminate oil. Renewables don’t grow on trees. Grown ass adult doesn’t get that. How do you tie your shoelaces ??? Like a monkey repeating stupid rhetoric instead of reading and making your own conclusion.
2871 2018-12-18 19:58:05 he's a House rep who's spent his entire political career in the House minority. he's never had an opportunity to do pro-fossil fuel things, and we likely won't see much from him before his pres run

we do know, however, that he and his family make a lot of $$$ off oil
2872 2018-12-18 19:58:05 Oil $45 handle.
2873 2018-12-18 19:58:02 Remember when they released an album they personally curated with all proceeds going to the oil spill. She clearly doesn’t care at all

2875 2018-12-18 19:57:55 Is now the right time to put money into oil? 
2876 2018-12-18 19:57:53 there is a difference between transitioning and quitting cold turkey which Justin and his merry band of morons want us to do so he can keep us in Saudi oil and support all his foreign buddies.  He's worse than his old man.
2877 2018-12-18 19:57:49 Boi eating oil, bruh
2878 2018-12-18 19:57:41 Actually it will never run out, the oil in the crust of the earth is from microscopic biological life, it is part of a living and renewing planet.
2879 2018-12-18 19:57:26 I’m starting to feel some pain with both! GKP will be more reactive to an increase to the oil price because Trinidadian tax will eat into any initial gains from TXP! That country really needs to review its oil tax regime!
2880 2018-12-18 19:57:26 Oil prices drop again on supply worries
2881 2018-12-18 19:57:24 Justin does not care. He has said that he wants to shut down the oil industry. You choose to be oblivious to his own words. He has also said that he favours Quebec. It is obvious when we see the money he gives Quebec from the rest of Canada. You choose to ignore the obvious
2882 2018-12-18 19:57:23 I worked in the oil fields in 2007, 08 and 09 I remember experiencing an oil field shut down and the beginning of troubled waters.  Voter registration  came to the oil fields to register us because we worked 24/7, we tried to not get him elected! LIAR!
2883 2018-12-18 19:57:23 Finally, maybe the change isn't in Dem attitudes about corporations, but behavior of corporations themselves, esp big tech monopolies, private equity, finance, oil/gas. Especially after financial crisis, corporations have not been held accountable for harm.  4/4
2884 2018-12-18 19:57:17 Looks like some big energy funds capitulated in oil; $CL ; acclerating the selloff in the broad market; my guess is market may bounce from here  $ES 2539.5; we shall see $SPY
2885 2018-12-18 19:57:05 Mineral oil 
And set a schedule.
Set down twice a day and try, or once a day.
It helps.

2890 2018-12-18 19:56:46 Iyap! Banyak yang nganjurin kalo step skincare itu dari yang konsetrasinya paling ringan kayak water base gitu ke konsetrasi yang lebih berat kayak pasta, oil gitu gitu
2891 2018-12-18 19:56:45 E o Oil? Wti -8%.
2892 2018-12-18 19:56:40 Loot&plunder is continuing today. Oil mafia (& now LNG mafia)& burecrats pocketed $300 million in last 3 months by creating artificial FO&NGL storage issues, Sui gas & LNG shortage, breakdown of ENGRO LNG terminal & high LPG prices (3000 MT of LPG was stored in Lahore by dealer)
2893 2018-12-18 19:56:38 makin a tincture with gorilla sherbet, golden lemon and a crazy blend of unnamed hemp strains co2 oil that’s 80%. I like lemony and purp terps in my tinctures so using lemon og and GDP
2894 2018-12-18 19:56:36 If you had even an elementary understanding of oil/chemical refining, you wouldn't touch the term "all-electric future." It cannot happen.

hope the stinging stops soon
2898 2018-12-18 19:56:18 We really went to war for oil lmao.
2899 2018-12-18 19:56:12 The Canadian oil sector should be left to fend for itself (rot) after years of crazy concessions, not get more than $1 billion in subsidies for telling the same old lies. #cdnpoli
2900 2018-12-18 19:56:12 En gros, la hausse du gas oil met les #Giletsjaunes dans la rue, @CCastaner les somme de rentrer chez eux 
Résultat sur tous les merdias le mouvement s'essouffle et hop le @gouvernementFR  en remet une couche.
Tut pour calmer ce peuple trop con pour comprendre la pensée complexe
2901 2018-12-18 19:56:09 Maybe if Alberta worked a little harder on getting along better with others such as PMJT/ BC and environmentalist you'd have a better chance of getting MORE energy products to markets. Right now oil is flowing through thousands of pipelines 24/7.  Ur just getting less $$ for it.
2902 2018-12-18 19:56:08 Okay I'll have to get more details about your routine in the group...especially the oil and seal part. lol

2906 2018-12-18 19:55:55 My grandma use to sneak a couple of teaspoons of castor oil in our juice.
2907 2018-12-18 19:55:52 If you are actually fighting for oil and gas workers, why did you back down on turning off oil taps to BC without winning anything in return? You pretend to want to help but you have dedicated your entire political life to being anti-energy. Hard to take what you say seriously.
2908 2018-12-18 19:55:48 Why are people screaming that it is speculators driving down the price of oil?  (shorts)
2909 2018-12-18 19:55:46 Believe it’s oil and refined products from Edmonton’s refineries. They want to twin the existing pipeline with a larger diameter pipe that will carry crude and diluted bitumen from the oil sands . Which would increase tanker traffic hence the national protests.
2910 2018-12-18 19:55:44 After they put him there in the first place and caused the death of 500,000 Iraqi's...many of them children. It wasn't about getting rid of Saddam...it was about securing one of the richest oil fields in the world.
2911 2018-12-18 19:55:43 $2200 for 4 oil leaks in the Cruz, dick shirley is a whole ass finesser 
2912 2018-12-18 19:55:42 Will he be speaking about what happened during the time he was a chairman of the board in lundin oil because that is the only thing i want to hear from him
2913 2018-12-18 19:55:41 So then do you believe that environmentalist will ever find an oil and gas project they do not oppose?
2914 2018-12-18 19:55:34 You are correct Dan.
Seems there is nothing we as citizens can do to mitigate the damage that is being inflicted on America. 
WDC seems to do what ever they like. The complicit Media has lost its Neutrality and has become unreliable.
2915 2018-12-18 19:55:31 Blood in the oil market.....@PPRadio919 @RevistaDinero
2916 2018-12-18 19:55:24 At least he is not around to see he is dead wrong with his oil and spx predictions
2917 2018-12-18 19:55:21 ... If we ran out of oil today, would anyone wish we hadn't been so wasteful of it in the past? No, they would blame gov't, or OPEC, or someone, but turning out the lights more would not have been an afterthought.
2918 2018-12-18 19:55:19 watching old episodes of "The French Chef" while I extract and format parts.  Interesting quotes so far that make you realize how far we've come as a food culture 1) "If you don't like the flavor of olive oil you can use a salad oil" 2) "Leeks seem to be hard to come by."
2919 2018-12-18 19:55:19 uh, wasn't it your government under Harper who also talked about transitioning away from oil and gas? keep living in the past, altho you can't even do that well, with how much you hide from your legacy of failure #ableg
2920 2018-12-18 19:55:18 Jason also is well aware of this. But industry wants Kitimat for Oil & Natural Gas. Because it would be convenient & cheaper for investors. LNG has approval, but smaller tankers are used. Easier to navigate the waterway.
2921 2018-12-18 19:55:12 The federal bail-out to Western Canada  oil industry, to little too late, further in debt and no long term vision or suggested solution.  Not surprising .
2922 2018-12-18 19:55:03 I seen a “Be his beard oil” tweet and the voice in the back of my head said “Facts”

2924 2018-12-18 19:54:54 Trump seldom does well in actual day to day life.  Bloated orange malfeasant with two (perhaps 3) failed marriages. Unhappy.  Insecure.  Up to his ears in nasty traits he can’t shake.  Many failed businesses.  The professional reputation of a snake oil salesman.
2925 2018-12-18 19:54:54 The lawsuits won’t solve the problem - not even a little.  It’s Geology.  The delta is mature and starving for sediment - it’s sinking.  That’s not the fault of the oil & gas companies. There are massive fault lines along the coast that show where it has been sinking.
2926 2018-12-18 19:54:53 Me too. Like Paul I’m a dedicated subject specialist pre-Gove and post-Gove - which is how I see 8 yrs of education. I see more snake oil from @educationgovuk than the likes of us good folk.

2929 2018-12-18 19:54:11 I went to buy Too Faced Born This Way foundation Sunday. I just want to say that I can’t wait til this whole coconut oil and water trend dies so I can have an easier time trying new products.
2930 2018-12-18 19:54:03 Painfully obvious
Justice and politics are like throwing water on boiling oil
2931 2018-12-18 19:54:01 oil and gas corporations are literally dictating policy to our government. them: buy our lousy pipeline, increase oil & gas subsidies, trample indigenous rights, ignore environmental protections
trudeau libs: sir yes sir!
2932 2018-12-18 19:54:01 Helping out #Alberta? Great idea. Pouring another $1.6B into oil and gas when we know what they are doing to the planet? Ridiculous. Put the money into the future of #energy, not the past.
2933 2018-12-18 19:53:59 #oil has now fallen ~40% in 2.5 months wiping out 18 months of gains. It has barely bounced in the last 10 weeks. Anyone who doesn't think that ISN'T scary for the boarder markets needs their head examined. When you try and unwind 10 years of CB largesse...
2934 2018-12-18 19:53:58 cbd oil
2935 2018-12-18 19:53:57 Sorry if I don’t sympathize with the oil industry. We all need and buy oil. If oil industry is struggling then find a way to make it work without public money.  The gov doesnt send our family business money when we struggle yet we’re expected to bail out the oil business? BS
2936 2018-12-18 19:53:50 What do you guys think of the narrative that US oil production is overweighted finance via junk bonds? @LogicalNumbers @DividendMaster @2HarryBawlz
2937 2018-12-18 19:53:50 The way my body responds to grape seed oil is amazing. Most oil just sits in on skin but grape seed is absorbed like my skin begged for it or something

2940 2018-12-18 19:53:45 I legit love .@EyaNaturals intensive deep leave in conditioner. I were my hair, put that in, add morning oil and seal with a curl custard
2941 2018-12-18 19:53:44 Diversify and grow, which itself will probably take oil to accomplish, this guy must walk everywhere and live in the woods in a hut he built with sticks and rocks
2942 2018-12-18 19:53:43 Don't let this weather stop your glow,I sell organic oil for skin/ hair care and black soap suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices, please RT and patronize thanks...
2943 2018-12-18 19:53:41 I need to stick to metals and shitcoins. I always get rekt when I go in on oil. Lmao
2944 2018-12-18 19:53:35 “And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine."”

2945 2018-12-18 19:53:32 My brother found CBD oil ingested made the shingles pain bearable. Also OTC cranberry concentrate pills can help with gout. Hope you feel better soon and don’t fall down the opioid hellhole.
2946 2018-12-18 19:53:20 Can anyone recommend a good non oil based hair conditioner. This Nigerian heat + my current conditioner is frying my beard . Please help.
2947 2018-12-18 19:53:19 oil down 8%   …  like the dow being down 1900
2948 2018-12-18 19:53:18 Stupid is an understatement I've finally saw what people have been talking about and what's with the pouring baby oil down his trunks and pulling a lollipop out of his sweaty ass crotch then puts it in the guys mouth i doubt pubic hair and baby oil doesn't taste good
2949 2018-12-18 19:53:16 I literally have everything in my trunk. I just need a tool kit. I have a lifter thingy, gas can, motor oil, jumping cables a funnel ...
2950 2018-12-18 19:53:11 you need supplies of oil to make petrol, which you need to go in the car. lousy analogy. and there is no such thing as the fast lane on a motorway. don't you know your own legislation?
2951 2018-12-18 19:53:10 Por mais q o preço do OIL influencie nos importadores por importarem  mais barato, essa queda tá mostrando preocupação com desacelaração mundial de crescimento para “daqui à pouco” rs se os emergentes importarem o OIL mais barato, mas o mundo n tiver consumindo, de nada adianta
2952 2018-12-18 19:52:55 “And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.”
Revelation 6:6 KJV
I’ve seen crazy doctrine taught from the word penny.
2953 2018-12-18 19:52:55 I just took my car to get an oil change for the first time 
2954 2018-12-18 19:52:51 4/ Get out of the way, support pipelines instead of crushing them with C-69 and the energy sector would begin to realize billions of dollars for the national treasury. Instead today another 800,000 barrels of foreign oil were delivered to Eastern refineries. #hopeless.
2955 2018-12-18 19:52:49 Blackbeard left me some beard oil and a case of saran wrap
2956 2018-12-18 19:52:45 @rosa_riscala mercado saiu de um questionamento de excesso de oferta para um questionamento de falta de demanda. Um grande processo de ajuste, que desta vez, parece que o produtor americano de Shale, terá que participar. Shale hj vende oil a 38 usd !
2957 2018-12-18 19:52:24 Costs dependant on share assets/debt, (NoDeal Indy=zero debt so.morw expensive).
Timing reasonable. 
Oil is a bonus & some expert estimates higher..and we're NOT running out 
Renewable Energy's our future:25% of EU renewables & 68.1% of RE in 2017.
2958 2018-12-18 19:52:17 I always am skeptical when someone says that a fund liquidation is causing pressure but it sure does feel that way in biotech and oil.
2959 2018-12-18 19:52:06 You must be confused kabayan, our company is Sirte Oil Co. but our location is not in Sirte, we are located in Marsa El Brega, Ajdabiya. Yes Petro Air serves all oil fields including our company & Sir @elmer_cato will take the same chartered plane when all arrangement are made.
2960 2018-12-18 19:51:51 #Oil prices in free fall:
WTI down 8% to $45.93
Brent falls 6% to $56.02
#OOTT #OPEC
2961 2018-12-18 19:51:51 I used to think the Saudis were pushing down prices to try to steal our market share. Now I think it's the other way around because Saudis did their financial forecasts with oil at $80 / bbl in 2019.
2962 2018-12-18 19:51:45 I don’t think these guys at the oil change place are on board with my feelings about Penny Marshall
2963 2018-12-18 19:51:44 The problem is politicians are not in power , haven't been since the oil embargo in '73 when financial institutions took power away from politicians. We wouldn't have to borrow to plug the deficit if corporations were paying their fair share of tax. Welcome to neoliberal hegemony
2964 2018-12-18 19:51:42 or (3) oil prices crashing
2965 2018-12-18 19:51:35 The entire @GOP are a Russian foreign asset 

The only reason this pig  @realDonaldTrump is not arrested now or at least this The White House be annulled, is that the @dnc are corrupt too. They, @GoldmanSachs have their monster right where they want him during entropic peak oil!
2966 2018-12-18 19:51:31 Conservatives wont save you. this has nothing to do with party politics. Big oil is dead.
2967 2018-12-18 19:51:28 It’s actually not as bad without the tank top and baby oil.
2968 2018-12-18 19:51:23 Teaspoon of mineral oil a day or a couple of dries apricots per day my grandmother told me this,she was the essence of old school born in 1917 passed in 1918 Rest In Peace grandma
2969 2018-12-18 19:51:16 You are very stupid. With pipelines built many jobs will be produced in the oil industry. You have no clue about the actual issues!
2970 2018-12-18 19:51:14 Groundout oil is not "glowing" 
2971 2018-12-18 19:51:04 maybe if i keep feeding oil panic, ill win
2972 2018-12-18 19:51:02 And the oil paid for the Iraq war! 
2973 2018-12-18 19:50:52 Not a real thing in my world. I'm an open-minded dude but - WHY?!?!? How about some Oil of Olay and a hot wash cloth??
2974 2018-12-18 19:50:52 someone nerf oil panic
2975 2018-12-18 19:50:48 Olbas oil on tissue for no 1 daughter. Itch eye 20'mins later.

2976 2018-12-18 19:50:29 Uhmm no it’s not  dw yam and oil is for the ELITE
2977 2018-12-18 19:50:18 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @steveliesman 7% drop in #wti today,...so no year end bonuses for #shale oil workers? @realDonaldTrump/#Trump sure took a wrecking ball to US #oil/@US_OGA! Even #Obama didn't do that! A net negative #GDP impact. #brent
2978 2018-12-18 19:50:12 At the pump we are still paying the same price as when oil was $ 100 a barrel, wtf?
2979 2018-12-18 19:50:10 Gold Miners 97% in buyable cycle. Haven't seen that in a while
Oil and gas Sector only 7% are in a buy cycle , not much breathing here however that can change quickly
TSX60 group 13% in a buyable mode at the moment, another handfull just waiting for a reason to go.
2980 2018-12-18 19:50:04 Grandpa took my car today while i was at work and put it on full plus got my oil changed...
2981 2018-12-18 19:49:54 @jimcramer, this is the first for so if the oil is bad cause it’s 
$49 a barrel would it be good for the  consumers ??
2982 2018-12-18 19:49:49 Also look into essential oils for cramps. I have a “moontime” CBD essential oil roller and it helps SO much. Check out humble roots medicinals she’s awesome 
2983 2018-12-18 19:49:47 absolutely love this picture! I need it painted in oil, over a fireplace!
2984 2018-12-18 19:49:43 Oil looks like shit
2985 2018-12-18 19:49:40 Holy shit.  First time I looked at the market today.   Oil ... bid wanted
2986 2018-12-18 19:49:36 It absolutely rules that instead of doing literally anything else with the money Canada will give $1.6 billion to oil firms while Indigenous nations lack drinkable water
2987 2018-12-18 19:49:34 I know that $45.00 has stop the oil industry and defaulting on loans is highly probably... @POTUS
2988 2018-12-18 19:49:33 When oil $hits the bed, it really $hits the bed...
2989 2018-12-18 19:49:29 Looks like a traitor oil Barron enabler has a problem with peaceful non violent protest and the first amendment!
2990 2018-12-18 19:49:29 Looks like Jr's hair needs an oil change.
2991 2018-12-18 19:49:27 The solution would'nt be to never use it, but to use it less and avoid the dirtiest form of oil extraction like tar-sands

It's Irresponsible because it produce lot's of externalities

And they have the audacity to ask for money... The give capitalism a bad name... Leeches
2992 2018-12-18 19:49:22 There is no way the supply issue is the reason for this decline in oil. It has to be something much bigger! This does not make any sense!
2993 2018-12-18 19:49:21 So deep it reached oil and USA invaded us.
2994 2018-12-18 19:49:17 Exactly - only Alberta Oil. We are scapegoats.
2995 2018-12-18 19:49:16 tá feia a coisa.....o coitado do OIL tá apanhando mais que vira lata sarnento em porta de açougue
2996 2018-12-18 19:49:13 @narendramodi farm entrepreneur... Allow farmers to make alcohol, methanol from grains, farm leftovers which is ancestral practise, let oil companies buy this stuff.
2997 2018-12-18 19:49:09 <オイルをぶっかけオイルをぶっかけられヌタヌタのヌラヌラのテカテカにしたろか?
2998 2018-12-18 19:49:07 I sell organic oil for hair/ skin care and black soap suitable for all skin types at affordable prices...
2999 2018-12-18 19:49:05 How’s economic diversification working for the Maritime provinces? Thought so. Your home province has been a have-not province for 40 yrs, while Alberta has been a super-have. I’ll stick with oil, thank you very much. Look around. World demand is nearing 100,000,000 bbls/day.
3000 2018-12-18 19:48:58 @NTB, what a bad experiance at National Tire & battery allston ma. 3.25 hours for oil & tire rotation. Got truck back and did not do tires. Very rude held truck another half hour. Manager was awful as was help. Stay away from @NTB.
3001 2018-12-18 19:48:53 what is your profession.I suggest u to oil your own......
3002 2018-12-18 19:48:50 Technology has rapidly improved the production of oil?
3003 2018-12-18 19:48:44 Andy, if that’s so then the oil industry and its workers should just reject the money and give it back to Canadians who really need it.
3004 2018-12-18 19:48:42 Cod liver oil
3005 2018-12-18 19:48:37 The National Review is awful. It gets it's funding from the Birch society and the Koch brothers which pushes conspiracy theories and pro-big oil propaganda. Next
3006 2018-12-18 19:48:30 The whole reason why she got a Twitter account was for that oil spill!
3007 2018-12-18 19:48:30 Oil has been getting killed the past 2 months
3008 2018-12-18 19:48:24 Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that once we're actually producing enough elecricity, and have a successful alternative to gasoline, that will have altered the economy enough that it will be difficult to return to the oil based economy.
3009 2018-12-18 19:48:23 i HATE getting oil changes because every single time the dudes feel the need to con me into fixing every little thing wrong with my car. yes i know there’s a lot wrong. yes i know it’s old. no i’m not gonna let you fix it. i’m gonna drive the piss out of it til it dies.
3010 2018-12-18 19:48:15 We have spent billions on r&d. Do you understand economics at all? Also you need to look up fatalism. I have already agreed that i dont like the current situation, being dependant on oil, but I also don't see you giving up your vehicle. You can also look up hypocrite.

3012 2018-12-18 19:48:12 Not moving off the oil standard decades ago will go down in history as the greatest mistakes made. People trying to make money on oil production have contribute to war, pollution, and inferior tech. Short that shit to hell, ride a bike or walk lazy fucks.
3013 2018-12-18 19:48:11 U.S. oil futures drop over 7% for lowest finish since August 2017

3016 2018-12-18 19:48:06 Beto is a big oil donor beneficiary, Joe Biden is ancient, Amy Klobuchar is a nobody, Hillary Clinton was a Wall Street elite

Why are white politicians, who show potential, being smeared by a bunch of progressives?
3017 2018-12-18 19:48:02 Plate tectonics and the idea that our world is ever shifting actually backs the idea that ancient areas or cities could/should be under water. Just like ancient low water areas that dried up is how we find oil. What are you talking about?
3018 2018-12-18 19:48:02 Hey @JustinTrudeau giving Billions to Alberta oil barons isn't the right way to fight climate change. You are letting down the planet doing so #cdnpoli
3019 2018-12-18 19:47:52 Love this app @gikibadges! Let’s you scan bar codes to see how healthy and sustainable your products are- if they’re recyclable or use irresponsibly sourced palm oil 
3020 2018-12-18 19:47:51 Norway has less Oil than Scotland and their industry makes more. Norway has more public control over oil than Scotland. The solution? Independence. Thanks "Ed"
3021 2018-12-18 19:47:48 Alberta Oil and Venture magazines were 18 months to two years behind. The publisher committed suicide.
3022 2018-12-18 19:47:45 Oh so he didn't have WMD's after all? Glad you agree with me. We loved Saddam when he fought Iran. Don Rumsfeld and Thatcher all loved him. The US installed him in Iraq in the first place. Then he threatened oil supplies and overnight he became the next Hitler.

3025 2018-12-18 19:47:35 6. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Quit trashing Obama’s accomplishments
3026 2018-12-18 19:47:32 #oil went up about 1/2 the move from May 2014 high to 2016 low - chart is clearly broken as it's went thru the 50% retracement - $35 is in the cards.
3027 2018-12-18 19:47:20 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
3028 2018-12-18 19:47:15 The government really screwed up the Canadian energy industry and Canada richness: oil. No Canadian oil but we can import as much as we need and want from dictatorial and human rights denial countries, yeah that's Justin, Bill, Catherine B and the never non elected Gerry who!!!
3029 2018-12-18 19:47:15 3/ The $1.6 billion is borrowed money because your government is running an $18  billion deficit and the national debt is crowding $700 billion. Your temp $1.6 billion handout does not deal with getting oil to the international marketplace.
3030 2018-12-18 19:47:15 Wait do people actually put that type of oil in there
3031 2018-12-18 19:47:13 It would be more helpful if people knew how government(s) worked and paid attention to what was REAL instead of trusting their oil patch pals to keep them informed!
3032 2018-12-18 19:47:12 But in some situations winning is needed. Sports is a clear example. In some cases they go together somewhat. If I succeed in find a new energy solution e.g. 90% solar conversion, it will cause a huge loss for oil & gas businesses and nations.
3033 2018-12-18 19:47:10 The oil market crashed again the last few days, be sure to cover some here as seasonality will likely see oil bottom in the next few weeks.  Merry Christmas everyone!
3034 2018-12-18 19:47:02 I still wonder who commissioned Rolls-Royce Sweptail...must have been some Saudi prince/princess... $12.8 million sounds like Middle-Eastern oil money
3035 2018-12-18 19:46:52 Apparently, the whole worlds economies must be collapsing....look at oil! Have to wonder, if the total debt in the world is finally catching up!!
3036 2018-12-18 19:46:50 H & J now believes with Oil Futures breaking below 46, it go all the way down into the 30s sometime in 2019
3037 2018-12-18 19:46:49 The tobacco flavor juul pod is GROSS. it tastes like what I imagine moldy cardboard with patchouli oil on it would taste like.

3041 2018-12-18 19:46:32 Check out the ratios on deep sea divers for oil rigs...
3042 2018-12-18 19:46:30 @Oil_2018 hahaha your bio mate.
3043 2018-12-18 19:46:29 I do a boiling pot of potatoes, broccoli, and carrots, and I add olive oil, salt, lemon pepper, garlic, and Italian seasoning. White people love that ish.
3044 2018-12-18 19:46:27 Through the same path that leads to religious and ethnic skirmishes. Through the same path that leads to the sharing of oil revenue at the end of every month. Through the same path carved by these ethnic and religious warlords. Through the same path of.....madness since 1960!
3045 2018-12-18 19:46:19 Oil -5.18%

3048 2018-12-18 19:46:11 What’s going on with oil? Getting pounded
3049 2018-12-18 19:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but open borders.
3050 2018-12-18 19:45:55 Crude Oil - 8% zieht die Wall Street in den Keller
3051 2018-12-18 19:45:54 it's the oil/flavoring
3052 2018-12-18 19:45:42 The market will rally when they stop shorting oil.
3053 2018-12-18 19:45:37 As a bare minimum, rice as it as very long shelf life if stored appropriately. Canned veg/fruit. Oil.
3054 2018-12-18 19:45:37 The power oil na gift from hamper commot am
3055 2018-12-18 19:45:32 oil is so underrated for detangling!!
3056 2018-12-18 19:45:19 All the economists/banks love to blame recessions on high oil prices. Guess it's time to rethink that false narrative. @LukeGromen @anasalhajji
3057 2018-12-18 19:45:11 Good grief!  Do you know how much traffic related to oil and gas exploration, development or production crosses the border between Texas and New Mexico each day?  Lots of jobs would be impacted. I find it hard to fathom that you would propose this. Dumb idea!
3058 2018-12-18 19:45:11 If they havent harvested all of it already and stashed it somewhere. I am afraid how our data(new oil) is being collected rn. Check out whose machines and servers South Sudan passports are made from? Where is the data stored? With how things are, we really need a megachange.
3059 2018-12-18 19:45:06 Oil finishes down over 7%.
3060 2018-12-18 19:45:00 I didn’t listen for 3 years till I realized I deadass had no lashes left and no I heard castor oil works but never tried it
3061 2018-12-18 19:44:53 Just Got My Oil Changed 
3062 2018-12-18 19:44:44 And the Majority of Canada's energy sector, is the oils industry. Quickly weaning Canada off of oil dependence, and expanding our green energy sector creates jobs, and stabilizes the economy against oil price wars and fluctuations that are consistently happening.
3063 2018-12-18 19:44:39 Somebody come get this car wash it inside and out get the breaks change get the shocks done and change the oil!  I’m off at 5

Man I need to start selling snake oil. I’d make a killing on you suckers.
3068 2018-12-18 19:44:04 I think regional banks, perhaps with local oil & gas exposure, make particularly good shorts at the moment... given interest rates going down and crude price collapse.
3069 2018-12-18 19:44:02 It makes no sense at all. They never properly explored krissy sexual preferences then they stick her with granny now they have her kissing val while rubbing her with the cult oil it's a no
3070 2018-12-18 19:43:52 Oil down almost 8% as well......
3071 2018-12-18 19:43:51 Listen, do you hear that? Groans and labored breathing... No, it’s not life being made. It’s the death rattle of the old world order. The Gods of #Oil #petroleum and #industry are on their death beds.   #GreenistheNewBlack #GreenNewDeal
3072 2018-12-18 19:43:50 A good rule to write down.  You don’t sit in momentum names that are below the 8/21day.  And if your an investor. You don’t own stocks that stay below the 50/200day for more than 3-5 sessions.  They can go anywhere.  $slb $ge sectors #oil. Etc. Etc
3073 2018-12-18 19:43:47 Eat less oil. Especially canola. Try to not touch your face.
3074 2018-12-18 19:43:46 And why palm oil now? Because people saw the adverts? Been known about for years. And takeaways switched to it in the 90's because its cheap.
3075 2018-12-18 19:43:45 I figured out my proofing dilemma y’all. I’m adding too much olive oil. Sacrificing fluffiness for flavor. Next time I’m cutting it in half and throwing in more herbs.
3076 2018-12-18 19:43:45 If there is no future in oil explain why use goes up every year and expected to until at least 2050... do a little research
3077 2018-12-18 19:43:38 this oil collapse is just going to collapse the banks and entire market AGAIN - just like it did in 2016
3078 2018-12-18 19:43:29 @ReidRomance - Turkish oil wrestlers. I dare you NOT TO DROOL
3079 2018-12-18 19:43:27 Can't the same argument be made against streaming or machinima? You used art, animation, potentially mocap, and the performances of sfx and foley artists to build your entire brand.
Can a football play be protected? What about a combat combo? Game mechanics? Too much oil on slope

3081 2018-12-18 19:43:23 7) If the industry dies in Alberta so what? We move on. We find other revenue streams. If the industry had bothered to do its due diligence as per @suncorenergy they would be refining oil and making profit no matter what the economics of oil. As for the policies of the NDP/Libs..

3083 2018-12-18 19:43:08 Why be envious of the EU? LOL The EU on its worse day is better than Russia on it's best day x 10. LOL The Tsar is regulating rap, having Pussy Riot whipped on streets. National pride over oil production. LOL Russians beg to enter EU. EU people go to RF for sex tours sadly.
3084 2018-12-18 19:43:04 HMU for an oil change on your car. 
I'm the man for the job!
3085 2018-12-18 19:42:56 What a stupid comment, Notley is turning her back on a constituent group, working harder than any Alberta premier has to bring oil to new markets, risking her reputation and you think she wants to kill oil and gas, you really are stupid.
3086 2018-12-18 19:42:54 Oil another one, bottomless. lol
3087 2018-12-18 19:42:54 AND we're already hearing the same garbage from people like Cramer that cheap oil is good for the consumer. YOU want me to play back all the videos from 2016 where he said that too? Didn;t matter then - wont matter now.

3089 2018-12-18 19:42:44 The intent is not the vilification of donors, but the need for pointing out the urgency of turning away from fossil fuels, as we have only 12 more years to avoid the worst of Climate Change. Beto's support of oil & fracking in TX does not align with our need for a #GreenNewDeal.
3090 2018-12-18 19:42:35 Oil prices have collapsed nearly 40% from the nearby highs. Never before has the Fed tightened policy into such a free-fall in crude. So why would it now? Look for the Fed to take a pass tomorrow. This is not about political pressure, but rather receding inflation expectations.
3091 2018-12-18 19:42:35 so he will end this deal ... yet keep allowing Saudi oil into Canada ..... which equates to ... more job loss anlong with the ones already lost because of Trudeau's lack of action on pipelines ...how can you call this a good move ?
3092 2018-12-18 19:42:35 Full tank of gas and a fresh oil change >>>
3093 2018-12-18 19:42:33 Beto loves big oil
3094 2018-12-18 19:42:17 ...you ironically typed into a device made from plastics, after you drove to the office heated by natural gas, in your car fueled by gas and oil...
3095 2018-12-18 19:42:17 Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for keeping oil prices low a day after giving it a pass on killing the journalist. Coincidence? I think not.

3097 2018-12-18 19:42:14 Wow, if you believe that then I have this great piece of land that has oil on it. You just have to find it..

3099 2018-12-18 19:42:09 1/ Ridiculous! You stated last weekend no pipelines through Quebec after QC Premier states he can't bear Alberta's "dirty oil.' Yet the pipeline funneling billions of equalization dollars from embattled Alberta to Quebec City is perfectly acceptable.
3100 2018-12-18 19:42:08 not sure if you want to experiment more, but my G/Daughters Mom mentioned CBD oil may cause remission of Lupus.
3101 2018-12-18 19:42:06 If this country wasn't eating itself, a sensible government would have time to ban things like polystyrene takeaway trays and non traceable palm oil. But nooooooo, kick out the foreigns.
3102 2018-12-18 19:41:59 Takes my truck to get the oil changed and looked over. Leave there pull up at the doctor and the front tires smoking like a train... what the hell
3103 2018-12-18 19:41:57 Venezuela is the achilles heal of the US. Too much oil and no US control. Once the mighty US Dollar is reduced to scrap in the international markets I believe you will be looking for somewhere to rent (or hide from your fellow Yanks)
3104 2018-12-18 19:41:48 aye bruh i need cbd oil
3105 2018-12-18 19:41:47 As if you are a white man. Concentrate on your Arab oil money club and leave ours
3106 2018-12-18 19:41:44 That would depend on the supply and demand for feathers would it not? Oil struggles as there is too much supply, lowering the price, which makes it costlier for Canada to produce vs other oil countries. They don't need a government bail out, they need a better businesses model.
3107 2018-12-18 19:41:40 No it’s not. Rapeseed oil is meh 
3108 2018-12-18 19:41:39 President crashes Oil so Powell gets more hawkish... Make equities and Oil bounce back... genius #OOTT
3109 2018-12-18 19:41:35 I just got out right now and I have an appt for an oil change at 12. What time will you be back?
3110 2018-12-18 19:41:29 5) US fracking boom has ensured that we've lost our only customer. So I am guessing that the only reason folks in US take our oil is to refine it and make profits of it. Once we start refining our own oil they won't bother and so we'd have to sell in Canada.
3111 2018-12-18 19:41:18 Olive oil deep conditioner
3112 2018-12-18 19:41:17 Bad thing my oil tank is leaking and has to be replaced. Good news getting my bird in 2 to 3 months.

Yayyyy bird.
#TuesdayMotivation
3113 2018-12-18 19:41:17 Sure, when there's no oil anywhere else.
3114 2018-12-18 19:41:13 WHOA! $OIL crude got hammered at the close, could be the bottom here, will watch
3115 2018-12-18 19:41:06 Oil crashing.  That's your signal to buy Naz typically. 
3116 2018-12-18 19:41:04 nvm it deps on oil :/
3117 2018-12-18 19:40:58 not my first time here. these moves are all bullshit and have nothing to do with supply OR demand!

PLUS all the U.S. P&E's AS you said are already WELL hedged so by the time those hedges run out wti should be back up.

Oil is worse than Bitcoin

@TradersCom @ThePitBoss16
3118 2018-12-18 19:40:55 I don't think it's survivable. In 1,000 years, we'll either be gone or be living in self sustaining environmental bubbles. It's going to get very bad

But I wonder if intelligent life can avoid this fate at all. Would the discovery of oil lead to this outcome, no matter what?
3119 2018-12-18 19:40:46 @rokwon coconut oil 
3120 2018-12-18 19:40:40 4) We're going to have to delay funding the liabilities cuz guess what? There is already a small window of opportunity to get the oil out and if we add the costs of the liabilities to this mix the industry will flee. I'm guessing it won't matter to the world as lots of oil now.
3121 2018-12-18 19:40:31 Theres an ez recpt for fruitcake wt Duncan Hines spice cake mix. Use melted unsalted butter for the oil; omit the water, + sub .5 c good Brandy; 4 eggs. Combine + beat well. Stir in a 2 lb  container candied fruit mix, .5 c ea raisins + currants, + 1 c chopped walnuts or pecans.
3122 2018-12-18 19:40:30 Oil!

3125 2018-12-18 19:40:22 Beto took $430,000 from oil and gas companies after promising not to take large donations from them.
3126 2018-12-18 19:40:19 cmon you need to bring back trying to get pussy with oil money
3127 2018-12-18 19:40:17 you still use tons of olive oil in your food, so your argument is invALID 
3128 2018-12-18 19:40:15 By,by US shale oil, no more money to earn.
3129 2018-12-18 19:40:10 WTI #oil now $46.28, off by - 7.22%
3130 2018-12-18 19:40:08 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
3131 2018-12-18 19:40:05 Seems' crude oil price at or near the lows for the year
3132 2018-12-18 19:40:04 You forgot your "Keep Alberta Oil in The Ground" protest sign! Oh wait that's for after May.
3133 2018-12-18 19:40:03 The oil and gas gravy train is running dry. Time to stop the handouts.
3134 2018-12-18 19:40:01 To treat lice, apply olive oil to your hair, and leave on for at least 40 minutes. Shampoo after.
3135 2018-12-18 19:40:00 หมายถึงอะไรใหญ่อะเฮีย โอ๊ย เหมือนใจยังฝั่งยุงานมันเหนือมากอยู่เลยจ้า ภาพมันติดตา ต้องใจ #เป๊กผลิตโชค
3136 2018-12-18 19:39:56 With oil trading around here, transportation stocks like $FDX should see massive saving going right to the bottom line. Watch for comments on their conf call.
3137 2018-12-18 19:39:52 Agora essa percepcao nao eh de riscos maiores, OIL a 46, US mkts derrentendo, spreads de credito abrindo e o caso do Flavio Bolsonaro?
3138 2018-12-18 19:39:50 you want another shill for oil and gas companies? another rich white dude gonna bring us the change we need?
3139 2018-12-18 19:39:49 I believe in Most High. God stands for gold oil and drugs
3140 2018-12-18 19:39:49 3) Unfunded liabilities of  more than $260 billion won't even cover a single tailings pond which IMO will not be remediated. We're trading resources for cheap now for jobs and a money float from oil industry. Now the cheap oil is gone, we're going to have to subsidize and delay.
3141 2018-12-18 19:39:39 And reducing consumption. Bitcoin, all night computers, whatever. Come on. We are never asked to do anything to contribute to the greater good beside dropping oil (i support solar!).  We are insatiably greedy.
3142 2018-12-18 19:39:28 Follow the truffle oil on main, it leads to me.
3143 2018-12-18 19:39:18 Extraordinary oil sama make over lip cream
3144 2018-12-18 19:39:17 egg and olive oil hair mask 1x a week.
3145 2018-12-18 19:39:08 HELL. NO. $430,000+ from oil companies, breaking his promise on accepting large oil donations — can’t even keep a promise when he’s not in office yet. get fucked. see? i can say fuck too. doesn’t mean i should be president.
3146 2018-12-18 19:39:07 Oil percent duh
3147 2018-12-18 19:39:07 And roofers and oil rig workers.
3148 2018-12-18 19:38:58 Isn’t that asking the Americans for payment for the wall?? We are paying one way or another as suspected and the sheep keep following the snake oil salesmen and his disinformation campaign!!!!
3149 2018-12-18 19:38:55 The struggle to be a good cat parent is too real. Making homemade cat treats in the dehydrator and trying to fight the tuna stench with an oil diffuser and open windows is true love   #catlovers #TheStruggleIsReal
3150 2018-12-18 19:38:46 It's because the UK is more healthily cynical, less easily taken in by Snake Oil salesmen, more wary of authority, more questioning, more critical. You get the idea.
3151 2018-12-18 19:38:46 Oil
3152 2018-12-18 19:38:41 The Oil and Gas biz tanked 5% today - this and not pipelines to be ready in 2021/22 are whats driving unemployment in AB today.  My oil stocks have been in the dumpster for yrs.  You cannot blame PMJT for that.
3153 2018-12-18 19:38:26 Just had my oil tank filled the week before Christmas...#helpmeimpoor
3154 2018-12-18 19:38:24 Tiene piso el oil @pattie_jabbaz @TinoTrader1 ??
3155 2018-12-18 19:38:23 Thanks for sharing that! I don’t cook with coconut oil, but I had no idea that it should be avoided! I lost 37 pounds this year (weight gained from steroid shots in my back), and would hate to think that something that people think is a healthy oil could sabotage a diet. Wow. 
3156 2018-12-18 19:38:19 Same old argument. Rather than spending the last 20 years investing in r&d, saving oil revenues for the inevitable bust & transitioning to alternative energy sources. AB blew all the $ and now has more demands. #bullshit #cdnpoli
3157 2018-12-18 19:38:09 I had a dream last night that an oil company was drilling in the harbour near where I live and the holes were so polluted that the water wouldn’t even enter them and you could see all the way to the bottom
3158 2018-12-18 19:38:08 #oil at my $46ish target from last month.  But I’m still not buying. Got here way too fast.  I’d cover some shorts though if you are short @LizClaman
3159 2018-12-18 19:38:07 Crude oil -7%
3160 2018-12-18 19:38:02 CRUDE OIL was FALLING further, WTI has lost another 3 USD and stopped at 46.70 USD; CAD was falling together with OIL, GBP/CAD +120 PIPS, EUR/CAD +110.
3161 2018-12-18 19:38:01 Yes but many people don't realize how important that war in Yemen is. If the Iranians do gain control of it they could choke off all oil heading to Europe and North America via the Suez Canal.
3162 2018-12-18 19:37:58 These Dow manipulators are now saying we have an oversupply of oil, tech stocks ? Chicoms? Whatever and they drive the Dow down from +300 to now +100.  These people can't stand lower taxes for gas for workers? Yikes.
3163 2018-12-18 19:37:57 Oil is starting to look interesting here.  If you believe the world is going to hell in a hand basket, starting to build a position here is a no brainer.  Do it gradually.
3164 2018-12-18 19:37:49 I love how the Anti-pipeline think they are helping the environment or humanity by blocking Canadian oil. Syrian oil is much better. 
3165 2018-12-18 19:37:47 vc acha que a turma local vai conseguir descolar sozinha ibovespa do s&p, dow nasdaq, russell (que ja ta em bear market cae 20%), oil c queda de 35%, europa, china +  asia? alias, estrangeiro que perdeu muito c/mercados acima vai vir no ibov...

Olive oil flavour get as e be abeg
3170 2018-12-18 19:37:25 Chris Heaton Harris Brexit Minister on channel 4 news was selling snake oil. Telling blatent lies that economy would continue to grow with a no deal Brexit. And could not answer if people had voted to be poorer.  The arrogance.
3171 2018-12-18 19:37:19 Ah. Det giver lidt mere mening, men den nye titel lugter af snake oil.
3172 2018-12-18 19:37:13 - The February 2019 NYMEX crude oil contract plummeted $3.64 to settle at $46.24, the lowest close since August 2017.
3173 2018-12-18 19:37:11 PM CMT

C+1 S+3 W-2. CAD - .37, 74.37, a new 18 month low.
Succumbing to the huge drop in crude oil today and lately
3174 2018-12-18 19:37:04 Since Ontario wants the pipeline , can’t we run it into the St Lawrence somewhere near Ottawa. We could fill the tankers dropping off the oil from Saudi, get great backhaul pricing
3175 2018-12-18 19:37:03 gotta rub her down with the anointing oil before you bless her canal and get the holy water up outta there
3176 2018-12-18 19:37:01 Teaching another class on @OPITOGlobal International Minimum Industry Safety Training (IMIST) for the Oil and Gas Industry tomorrow.

3177 2018-12-18 19:36:56  We been giving her CBD Oil daily, her energy has improved and hasn’t lost her appetite yet. Maybe there’s a chance she’ll conquer this cancer and live a little longer. We still have a theory she’s holding on to meet Baby Q
3178 2018-12-18 19:36:45 I thought they are twins. U know what oil does 2 paving?  waite untill their mother sees the paving let alone their clothes n shoes.
3179 2018-12-18 19:36:43 TMX only barely makes sense with oil over $100. And that's not happening while the US and OPEC is increasing production all the time.
3180 2018-12-18 19:36:38 The move in oil is amazing today, especially after it has been crushed in the last month or so already! This is crazy! Everything is being sold. It feels as if the market is in a total collapse!
3181 2018-12-18 19:36:37 Nothing better than finally getting your oil changed after going 2500 miles over....feels like a whole new car....why do I do this 
3182 2018-12-18 19:36:36 shove that freakin oil where the sun don't shine
3183 2018-12-18 19:36:35 Oil continues to get smoked. 
3184 2018-12-18 19:36:33 Thanks. In my personal opinion, yes, but for people at Oil Change and Sunrise Movement (and myself & many scientists) view climate change as the biggest threat to human life, so they're taking that issue more seriously than others. I think that makes sense.
3185 2018-12-18 19:36:22 Does this @CNBC guest at S&P pay any attention to the oil price market .... seems like she has no clue.
3186 2018-12-18 19:36:08 Why oil price lost control?
3187 2018-12-18 19:36:08 Oil dropped to 47. Watch energy stocks shit the bed tomorrow
3188 2018-12-18 19:36:04 Bitch the pizza itself is greasy!!! have you see the oil on the cheese, you blind blind Italian
3189 2018-12-18 19:36:02 These oil guzzling vampires are at it again. If you care more about oil, you don't care about anything and that's sickening.  #Unistoten #UnistotenCamp #lifeoveroil #oilcompaniesaremoredangerousthanracists
3190 2018-12-18 19:35:58 This guy Andrew needs to be educated with facts. Canada is filled with these emotional delusional types. Global oil demand is expected to continue to grow for at least the next five years and beyond. There is no viable substitute at this point in time.
3191 2018-12-18 19:35:54 No, LNG isn't viable either. For the same reason. There is too much oil and gas on the market vs demand. Storage facilities are filling up and tankers are being parked at sea because there's nowhere to unload. So prices are low.
3192 2018-12-18 19:35:44 I don’t know shit about car maintenance all I know is to keep up with oil changes and I only get new tires when the little notification thing is on 
3193 2018-12-18 19:35:25 This guy is obviously a panty waste who has no idea how to manage a weapon.  Both tears and patchouli oil would be harmful to the components of a modern firearm.

This cuck just showed his azz with his poor knowledge of how firearms work.
3194 2018-12-18 19:35:12 Crude oil currently. $46.62 down $3.26

3197 2018-12-18 19:34:56 @BNNBloomberg #Commodities 
"We need some sort of infrastructure to move our oil" Are we just now starting to figure this out in 2018. Where we unaware of this fact when the oil sands first started production?
C'mon people, wake up!
3198 2018-12-18 19:34:50 And the better option is?????
Ride a horse 20 miles to work??? Buddy I don't even know you, but I can guarentee that 75% of the stuff around you is somehow made from oil products. In case you cant tell, I love the  too, but I'm also fatalistic and realistic about our situation.
3199 2018-12-18 19:34:50 What good is it with an oil curtailment. Please explain.
3200 2018-12-18 19:34:49 should change that to Oil.........
3201 2018-12-18 19:34:40 if i have a child the only thing theyre going to eat is olive oil based pasta im sorry

3209 2018-12-18 19:34:02 @NSoames How dare you tell a man who speaks for HALF OF SCOTTISH VOTERS to go back to sky.
Most dishonourable considering scotlands huge contribution to keeping the UK afloat by allowing WM to take 92% of our oil and gas revenues for 50 years.
You want us all to get on don't you?
3210 2018-12-18 19:33:56 Where's your 80m a day come from? The original 20m per day number from Scotiabank came into existence because they assumed every barrel of oil was bitumen and subject to the price differential. Only about 20% is.
3211 2018-12-18 19:33:54 its only oil, not like its important to THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
3212 2018-12-18 19:33:50 Alberta has been hurting for four years! We need more than money given to the big companies, the oil workers and oil towns need help. We need pipelines.
3213 2018-12-18 19:33:39 And who said lower oil = lower inflation = lower bond yields?
@RaoulGMI

3215 2018-12-18 19:33:37 @DougKass Will great earnings from $FDX & lower oil prices push $FDX back to $225 by Year-end?
3216 2018-12-18 19:33:34 Apparently this $1.6 billion in support to the oil and gas sector from the Export Development and Business Development Bank is not enough to satisfy Scheer Nonsense. He wants to spend a lot more of our taxpayer money.

3220 2018-12-18 19:33:31 It wasn't so much about oil, as currency. Ghadaffi had plans for a new African currency which would undermine the USD, which the globalists wouldn't stand for. Lincoln & Kennedy both tried to print their own money in defiance of the elite, both were also assassinated
3221 2018-12-18 19:33:24 Awww my company gave us 50kg bag of rice, semo, pack of juice and 5ltr groundnut oil
3222 2018-12-18 19:33:20 At what point to market bulls recognise that something is very wrong with Oil?
3223 2018-12-18 19:33:19 Both have access to the SM/CU. One has a gold plated currency and have invested Oil reserves in a massive wealth fund

The other has retained a growing international hub in trading and financial services.

Both have low debt.

Falling out on WTO terms is barely an option at all.
3224 2018-12-18 19:33:19 Not sure I could face a whole slice, but grated in hummus it was sweet and tasty.

3227 2018-12-18 19:32:49 I prefer to refer to them as the groups of Snake Oil Salesmen
3228 2018-12-18 19:32:47 Actually it isn't the only solution. We have been selling our oil for cheap to USA which has profited. This sell out was by the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs and @CPC_HQ So really the solution is to refine at home and sell for big bucks. Current pipelines used inefficiently. Improve use.
3229 2018-12-18 19:32:44 Ok I’ll try again. 
As thick, toxic and diffuse as the Exxon Valdez oil spill. How’s that?
3230 2018-12-18 19:32:40 A toddler can see the correlation between oil and gas.... finally got that capitulation by the longs..... enjoy .... 46.... Lolololol... 
3231 2018-12-18 19:32:33 Next time try a barrel of crude oil.
3232 2018-12-18 19:32:33 #Trump wants to build a wall to keep out the "bad people" on our southern border. Who is the real threat? Them or his bastard supporters who refuse to acknowledge this guy is a crook, a charlatan, and a two bit snake oil salesman / conman?
3233 2018-12-18 19:32:27 bought to rub this tranquil essential oil all over my body to ignore my problems lol
3234 2018-12-18 19:32:25 People overlook the importance of higher oil prices. This recent drop is not a good sign and leads to rising pressures on oil extractors, which leads to rising defaults (especially in a rising interest rate environment).
3235 2018-12-18 19:32:21 The oil industry is crippled by this clown and he offers help in the form of money for anything but oil.

You can shove it up your silver plated ass!!!
3236 2018-12-18 19:32:19 how much of it is just oil?
3237 2018-12-18 19:32:10 People with cars are always trying to be classist to the people without. 

But let their asses need more than a oil change and they cant afford it 
3238 2018-12-18 19:32:10 I understand that we use oils for plastics. I can also see the writing on the wall when it comes to burning oil for energy. We’ll all be driving electric vehicles in 20 years and the world will be better for it. I don’t hate the oil industry I just see the demand shrinking.
3239 2018-12-18 19:32:10 If I were fighting #Brexit just for me I'd say "fuck it. If you want to disappear up your own arseholes go for it" and I'd go & market my brother-in-law's sublime olive oil to the Japanese. I am fighting for the NHS that brought me, and last week my great niece, into the world.
3240 2018-12-18 19:32:08 My friends were robbed of their phones and cash in a Keke they boarded from Amadi roundabout to Okuru-Ama/Odili roundabout 3 weeks ago. Slaughter - Abuloma, Slaughter- Woji are areas that have been reportedly prone to such attacks. Also Oil mill-Eleme  interchange.

3244 2018-12-18 19:31:43 Don’t sell off our parks. Today it’s cabins, tomorrow it could be mines or oil rigs.
3245 2018-12-18 19:31:36 Oil has hit my target. Knew the $50 loaders needed to get abused first. Long $OILU 15, long $GUSH 9.05. Will make 30-50% gains on these.
3246 2018-12-18 19:31:36 Oil Wti - 7,27%

3250 2018-12-18 19:31:27 The Financial Outlook 
Both the Oil market and the Stock market are telling us something which does not look good . Central Banks seem determined to keep raising rates .Believe the Dow could go back to Election Night levels . But its a Double whammy for the UK with Brexit fears

3252 2018-12-18 19:31:20 I mean, this guy isn’t even taking into account where/how the oil is imported and the taxes that may apply, gas near the Port of Tampa will be much cheaper than gas in Oklahoma City
3253 2018-12-18 19:31:16 31 under 53 working deliberately between Oil & Energy.
3254 2018-12-18 19:31:15 Oil
3255 2018-12-18 19:31:08 I hate getting oil changes
3256 2018-12-18 19:30:55 People in the oil and gas industry, predominantly executives and other highly paid employees, fund corporate PACs. If you reject corporate PAC money, you can still get donations from execs via individual contributions, as I've shown with Beto.
3257 2018-12-18 19:30:52 And there will be thousands of families in Alberta without money for Christmas or anything else due to layoffs from the oil industry there.

3260 2018-12-18 19:30:44 Someone asked me about oil and where I see it heading to now that it hit $48.  I think we have a good shot of testing the $46.10 level & breaching that, we could see a drop to the $43.51 level.  Good luck oil traders, but I still love $XOM  & would be taking a small position here

3276 2018-12-18 19:30:07 Last time earth stabilized via   specifics die off where carbon was sequestered within tissues, ie. the deposits of today's oil & gas. Change may be too rapid. Thou, it's obvious resources are finite so humanity ought to contain itself & be frugal.
3277 2018-12-18 19:30:06 Don’t eat crisps ... palm fruit / oil used in their production contributes to the homelessness of indigenous people / environmental decimation and threat to orangutan population

3279 2018-12-18 19:30:03 Well, the Bush II administration already had attack plans of Iraq from pre-Sept11 showing which US companies got which oil, these were (are?) in the public record as white papers. The decades of sanctions only hurt the Iraqi people without much unseating Hussain & cost a fortune.
3280 2018-12-18 19:30:01 Your disrespect for @potus is a disgusting disgrace! @realDonaldTrump is ofCourse right that all electric makes no sense currently. A balanced line up is the way to go. Oil will not disappear immediately, we need a soft transition to keep people at work and society in control!

3283 2018-12-18 19:29:43 Max im not sure this isn't part of their anti oil, globalist plan. I'm beginning to think they are far more sinister than you realize
3284 2018-12-18 19:29:40 Good thing for oil prices that OPEC cut output  
3285 2018-12-18 19:29:36 I am going to SAMI village for 1-2 weeks. I'll borrow machines there. There is oil on top of "KOMSE", our name of the cradle.

3288 2018-12-18 19:29:21 Shopping in @IcelandFoods was a freaking dream. Having everything without palm oil and/or plastic packaging clearly labelled made it so much easier to pick things. We've got some awesome Christmas food, including no palm oil mince pies!

3289 2018-12-18 19:29:06 Do they make an essential oil that keeps people who like essential oils from talking to me?
3290 2018-12-18 19:29:05 Brakes fixed now I need a damn oil change
3291 2018-12-18 19:29:04 Try using a steam inhaler with oblas oil. It is brilliant for clearing sinuses etc. Hope you get better soon

3293 2018-12-18 19:28:54 I support all Canadians, but I don't buy for even one second that most of this isn't being created by big oil money. Think for a few seconds please, how is it that you are all facing unemployment when the same infrastructure is still there??
3294 2018-12-18 19:28:49 I need beard oil
3295 2018-12-18 19:28:48 Lol @ the block but poor Mrs Oil! Its like an added insult when they put mimimum carriages on after the cancelled one

3297 2018-12-18 19:28:46 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 4 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

3301 2018-12-18 19:28:10 2 random ass things that have made me overjoyed today: eucalyptus essential oil and gas is $2.74
3302 2018-12-18 19:28:09 Ottawa is giving the Alberta oil industry $1.6 billion. This is good news! It may even arrive in time to give oilfield executives a nice fat year end bonus.
3303 2018-12-18 19:28:07 I guess everyone is dumping oil for a bigger fool before 2019. 

$WTI -7%
3304 2018-12-18 19:28:07 moving back to Toronto is like inheriting my father’s oil empire that I was groomed and destined to one day take over, but I’m currently rebelling by galavanting around the globe (Montreal) because it’s MY life and my last name does NOT define who I am, sometimes I just want to-

3308 2018-12-18 19:27:44 May God deliver you from the shackles of poverty...

Instead of buying the drinks you should have bought more oil cause that oil won't last you a week. Learn how to be economical and set your priorities straight
3309 2018-12-18 19:27:41 Let's add up the costs for attempting to satiate Albertastan. Pipeline $4.5B, pipeline expansion $7-10B, Oceans Protection Plan $1.5B, oil gas bailout $1.6B, increases to EI eligibility $2.4B. So shut your cake holes about Quebec getting a measly $11B. AB is running up deficits.
3310 2018-12-18 19:27:33 People like you have been telling us that we are “running out” of fossil fuels for decades, the original fear estimates had us already out by now. There is enough oil and gas to last over a century but luckily we won’t need it that long b/c we’ll develop new sources.
3311 2018-12-18 19:27:31 Stopped oil?
3312 2018-12-18 19:27:29 We don’t hear about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that’s existed for the last few years and still leaking but hey 
3313 2018-12-18 19:27:17 Thanks Steve, looking forward to it - especially being able to now buy things like 24pk toilet roll and that extra large bottle of olive oil without worrying I won't use before moving again...
3314 2018-12-18 19:27:17 Ahhh idk I heard it was a lot of maintenance though and you can’t use oil products ! So I’m nervous
3315 2018-12-18 19:27:12 if oil is the guide (I believe it is), this is over guys.. I don't know any old-school trader who won't sell the shit out of this into the bounces... brace for impact sometime next year.. happy new year!

3321 2018-12-18 19:26:30 .@AndrewScheer on today’s $1.6B federal oil and gas sector bailout. “...a desperate, election-year attempt to trick western Canadians into thinking he cares."

3323 2018-12-18 19:26:25 Tonight's stream might be a little bit late.  Burning the midnight oil at work for an exciting project.
3324 2018-12-18 19:26:24 Anti-vac moms will get their pets vaccinated against rabies but think essential oil is gonna cure their kid from the inevitable polio they’ll get. I am confusion
3325 2018-12-18 19:26:19 Oil is such a total sham. One big ridiculous technical trade

At least going in right direction now where it should be
3326 2018-12-18 19:26:18 If you are making that argument , then its fair to say that you also contribute to the oil money by buying gas and paying for electricity. He got his donations from individuals and not corporations.
3327 2018-12-18 19:26:16 What we're looking at is literal CEOs of oil and gas companies who have in many cases maxed out their contributions. I think that's a reasonable thing to want to avoid. CEOs spend their money on candidates in order to curry favor & open doors, that seems pretty clear.
3328 2018-12-18 19:26:13 next put def for oil at 45.5~~~~ due to the 46 puts of this week

3331 2018-12-18 19:25:40 No, oil executives give u big donations en masse if they believe u have track record of favouring them,his voting record is there to see,he is a new democrat,votes with trump 30% of the time(represents a safe blue district).

3343 2018-12-18 19:24:40 How are gov regs reducing competition in media and banks? We still have competition in oil companies and fast food and department/grocery stores but it doesn’t stop corruption.
3344 2018-12-18 19:24:32 2/People will still drive and fly and we will still drill for oil, mine coal (for a bit longer) eat beef etc.  But hundreds of millions of people are doing nothing, and l negative repercussions are already in motion.

3345 2018-12-18 19:24:29 Oooh I need to try that lip oil!! Thank you beaut 
3346 2018-12-18 19:24:27 "particularly since Russian oil companies aren’t thrilled about OPEC action stunting their growth plans" - would they rather grow 10% yet have half the revenue? Are they in business to make money or to produce oil?
3347 2018-12-18 19:24:27 Everyone except the billionaires who have oil money.
3348 2018-12-18 19:24:27 It would be alot easier to advance beyond oil and gas if we had the money from oil and gas to pay for the R&D in newer sources of energy.
3349 2018-12-18 19:24:23 In essence they are saying you have to pay politicians enough to make them above being bribed. Now explain to me what number would be enough that a multi trillion dollar industry like OIL, or DEFENSE contractors can't afford to pay you more.

3363 2018-12-18 19:23:12 Just Charles...oil prices are falling the world over. Seems to be end of cycle dip (typical for end of a market bull run). Agreed people of Alberta need help, but is there really a lot Canada can do. We are a price taker not a price setter. Feel for families of unemployed.
3364 2018-12-18 19:23:10 Cheap gas for majority of Canadians or high oil prices for the oil industry. The Canadian conundrum. Not everyone is complaining
3365 2018-12-18 19:23:08 Hehehehe....oil
3366 2018-12-18 19:23:03 No “deals” are being transacted now. Banks aren’t lending and the oil price happened so fast people didn’t hedge. October 1st with looming Iran sanctions people were expecting $85 oil by year end. Instead it’s $47 today
3367 2018-12-18 19:22:59 Please say you are going to follow this up with the Isuzu P’up… or the diesel one my friend converted to run on waste veggie oil back when that was the craze in 2004. 35 gallon tank from TSC in the bed and 40mpg baby.
3368 2018-12-18 19:22:54 *:･ﾟ✧ use almond oil and vitamin e.
*:･ﾟ✧ invest in a humidifier.
*:･ﾟ✧ don't pick at your lips.
3369 2018-12-18 19:22:49 So on some level, sure... sending a check to people is fine. Some oil economies do it, in fact. But it doesn't address the root cause of the problem - some people own the method of production, and others are effectively no longer needed for that production.

3372 2018-12-18 19:22:34 My reaction exactly. Until you remember they're wasting money on soundbite, snake oil, vote spinners like Space Force while shafting veterans.
3373 2018-12-18 19:22:31 The irony is cheap #oil over next few months could avert the next global recession and may be just the economic stimulus that will lead to higher demand for oil in 2019 than many are forecasting...
3374 2018-12-18 19:22:28 Why she dressed like olive oil...
3375 2018-12-18 19:21:59 keem! Give him high doses of CBD oil or Doggie treats. Can find them all over The nation now. Will make the final stages much more comfortable for him. I promise.  you’ve got tons of support homie!
3376 2018-12-18 19:21:58 Long Oil at 4703 - 30 point stop
3377 2018-12-18 19:21:57 What is mudnight oil and how do I aquire it
3378 2018-12-18 19:21:54 Ryan google how anything is made. Key ingredient: O I L. You eliminate oil, you eliminate our existence. Everything is made of oil or made from oil based products and tools. How hard is that to understand ?
3379 2018-12-18 19:21:53 So I used to use coconut oil but it started actually worked great but then got worse. SOO Use Aloe Vera Gel, It is the best Moisturizer. I have been using it for months now, and my skin has never looked better. It is also a great primer!
3380 2018-12-18 19:21:53 No problem, by that time they’ll be playing it in any oil rich statelet prepared to stump up the incentives to the right people
3381 2018-12-18 19:21:48 Oil tanked in the weeks leading up to the busiest holiday season ever.  Might be an interesting play here on $FDX coming into earnings tonight
3382 2018-12-18 19:21:47 I don't follow the logic...if price drops that much it is because demand, and hence economic activity, has collapsed (unless AI invents a new energy source and we don't need oil ). Aside from Saudi, who will be producing oil at $10?
3383 2018-12-18 19:21:42 Shocking he is on leafs lunch and starts talking Mike Babcock .... Miller overrated and probably part of reason TSN lost hockey rights to the losers @Sportsnet
3384 2018-12-18 19:21:34 In my opinion no. Stuart and his father were J. Paul Getty private lawyers and were responsible for handling and probating his estate and managing the Getty Trust's general activities abroad.  He was also an executive of Santa Fe International Oil.
3385 2018-12-18 19:21:24 @OPECSecretariat @OPECnews 
So people, how do you like oil under $57?
Trump has used all of you, especially Saudis for his own interests to convert low oil into votes.
Go ahead and calculate your billions of loses everyday.
This is just the beginning and get ready for the worse.

3388 2018-12-18 19:21:08 This kind of story sounds way too familiar...
3389 2018-12-18 19:21:07 Wow $oil is just sh*tting the bed right now.

Let's check with the $usdcad.

Nope nothing lol
3390 2018-12-18 19:21:06 Color: Fuscia

3391 2018-12-18 19:21:02 Oil industry has a very squeaky wheel.
3392 2018-12-18 19:20:59 Just another day in a life... just met Phil Niekro former Hall of Fame pitcher gettin a oil change
3393 2018-12-18 19:20:55 My grandpa started taking cbd oil and it has helped him so much, he’s finally eating and talking more 
3394 2018-12-18 19:20:40 Investor sentiment has turned substantially. Oil stocks are where they were in the 2008 crisis. Oil prices have fallen so fast it’s scared many. NG prices have firmed and could spike from here (low storage) if Oil prices don’t firm in 4-6 weeks very hard times will ensue
3395 2018-12-18 19:20:40 Hot oil treatment next for this hair. Can’t deal
3396 2018-12-18 19:20:38 Also a bigger population means more demand for energy. We are already struggling with this in view of our climate and high dependence on oil and gas.
3397 2018-12-18 19:20:34 The “60 Minutes” story about plastic last Sunday showed an even worse human caused environmental crisis, which, since plastic is made from oil, is tightly related. With the current incompetent administration, we are so screwed.

3400 2018-12-18 19:20:09 Oil is still leaking ...
3401 2018-12-18 19:20:03 Wow look at this oil move.  Oil stocks getting creamed too.
3402 2018-12-18 19:20:02 In addition, if it were truly convertible, the stampede out would be fast and violent.  Rich people would rather have their money in a less capricious jurisdiction. Just because you buy oil in a currency doesn't mean either party wants to hold it any longer than they have to. 2/n
3403 2018-12-18 19:20:01 So if country X is budgeting for $80bbl $CL_F oil and country X also holds bazillions in US equities..... hmmmm......
3404 2018-12-18 19:19:59 Anytime I remember  the video of citizens scooping  groundnut oil (not petrol o) from the gutters, I cringe, then it dawns  on me once again that having a president doesn't necessarily mean there is a Country. This is not a Country, we have failed.
3405 2018-12-18 19:19:49 Funny too. If not for journalism and reported to cover western oil crisis, no one outside of working in the upstream part of industry would know any of the problems.... Or lack thereof in some cases. Bailouts can be a dangerous game. Just look at GM and Ontario.
3406 2018-12-18 19:19:43 The point is they are using the climate deals not to reduce poison/pollution but to make money and gain control-we are being duped because we want clean air, water and food and the same people who got  rich on oil ect. Is getting Rich on climate deals
3407 2018-12-18 19:19:31 get that tanning oil
3408 2018-12-18 19:19:30 Is there an essential oil or a crystal that helps me stop spending money uncontrollably? Asking for myself!

3410 2018-12-18 19:19:16 Making it in a pan is fine. I wanted something healthy to grab when I'm hungry but too lazy to cook. I wanted to avoid all of the oil in the microwave packs, but they are very tasty! Sorry you can't handle popcorn anymore, Meredith!

3412 2018-12-18 19:19:12 The "Green New Deal"  sounds good but if it punishes  the poor and Middle-class with highwe cost$  then it is not  worth the effort!   We should not have to suffer at the expense of Big Oil, Electric Companies or Gas companies etc.
3413 2018-12-18 19:19:07 Mrs Oil having same experience.

Would complain to our MSP but he blocked me.

3415 2018-12-18 19:19:00 my face is nothing without rosehip oil

3417 2018-12-18 19:18:43 Tweeps, we just put a perfectly functional snowblower at the curb.  Needs an oil change, but that’s about it.  It was my dad’s old one and we don’t use plus garage is going to be knocked down.  #FREE
3418 2018-12-18 19:18:42 (4/n) Then the next bullet: "A new $500-million Energy Diversification commercial financing envelope (...) help higher-risk but viable oil and gas small business enterprises (...) expand into new markets." Ditto: *how do you access new markets without market access?*
3419 2018-12-18 19:18:41 Got all kinds of IRL stuff going on. And all I want to do is bust out some keys in WoW. 

1) Oil change
2) shopping with wife
3) house chores

Well. Guess there’s always tomorrow for keys lol
3420 2018-12-18 19:18:37 If the oil era is dead, then lead the way and stop using it. All of it.
3421 2018-12-18 19:18:32 Hahaha lad he had half a billion worth of investment and backed by a whole country funded by oil....If ever the tables was turnt.

Get Pep in that environment and with those players same results different person
3422 2018-12-18 19:18:21 Auto mechanic did it. Between a lube job and oil change.

3424 2018-12-18 19:18:05 Toaster oven. Drizzle olive oil lightly over fries. 10 minutes at 350 degrees
3425 2018-12-18 19:17:55 I know some downstream producers who will buy that cheap oil and produce the hell out of all sorts of things. They will more than pick up the slack. As long as the Fed or Congress doesn't screw it up.
3426 2018-12-18 19:17:51 everything that was wrong with my car is finally fixed. tires, brake pads and rotors, spark plugs, oil change, some belt thingy, and the cracked transmission pan. all replaced and or fixed.
3427 2018-12-18 19:17:50 I love mortar and pestles,  So handy for many uses.  i got a bigger one to crush food grade diatomaceous earth that I added some cedar oil.  It made clumps that were hard as rock.
3428 2018-12-18 19:17:46 First I use cetaphil to wash my face. Bc it doesn’t strip the natural oils . Then  I use the Nivea essentially enriched 48 hour moisturizer. And tea tree oil that might help!
3429 2018-12-18 19:17:34 Put some clove oil in my coffee today.. Now my mouth is numb & I hate myself.
3430 2018-12-18 19:17:29 That's what makes it so unbelievable to me. They must have had millions and millions in the bank. Why not just say no to a couple people? Especially if you want to be seen as the No Oil guy.

3436 2018-12-18 19:17:10 Today the feds/PMJT gave what business agrees Alberta needs in the form of 1.6 billion. The downfall of the oil patch in Alberta the fault of USA policies.  But don't expect any appreciate from the cry babes in AB. They didn't even bother to show up. So they can't be that bad off
3437 2018-12-18 19:16:52 I highly recommend a good multi vitamin/mineral, fish oil, and meal replacement.  Would you be open to specific recommendations?

3440 2018-12-18 19:16:32 Rapeseed oil > Olive oil.
3441 2018-12-18 19:16:10 I defer to @WallisMarsh on anything oil related.
3442 2018-12-18 19:16:07 Given the cost governors should put the brakes on that kind of spending.
Snake oil don't come cheap.
3443 2018-12-18 19:16:06 Cannabis oil can treat a lot of ailments from playing the game.
3444 2018-12-18 19:16:04 Negligence to the oil owner. This is hazard and could even kill the innocents
3445 2018-12-18 19:16:00 a few yrs ago my babysitter, who was a cancer survivor, said she was downing 8 tbs of coconut oil a day to 'ward off' reoccurrence. she wound up dying from a heart problem instead. saturated fat is NOT good for your heart.
3446 2018-12-18 19:15:59 This is to my American peeps, plss let that nonsense of cooking efo riro with vegetable oil stop in 2018 ooo, buy a small can of red oil for less than $10 and give us the real deal, I’m tired of going to Nigerian parties and eating Efo olororo, Thank you

3448 2018-12-18 19:15:46 A massive dose of caster oil which would fire everyone at the DOJ who came to the agency during the Obama era. Appointees could be gone immediately, but those in union positions would have to have their current jobs eliminated and then seniority would determine who goes or stays.

3453 2018-12-18 19:15:28 Trump is going to allow the Republicans to take away their Medicare and SS. He's going to allow for the TPP to pass. He's going to let the GOP sell our land to Oil companies and these ppl are going to die from everything the EPA protects them from.

3457 2018-12-18 19:14:44 If you are making that argument , then its fair to say that you also contribute to the oil money by buying gas and paying for electricity. He got his donations from individuals and not corporations.

3473 2018-12-18 19:12:54 My pipe dream literally is to get Alberta oil sold internationally and shipped to Canadian refineries.
3474 2018-12-18 19:12:52 Oil the latest culprit weighing on $SPY today with $XOM in free fall. 

But low oil is a great thing for 85% of World

That’s probably 1-2 rate cuts for the economy
3475 2018-12-18 19:12:50 This is not about helping Alberta 
We all know how you feels about us 
This is more for optics  
Look Canada. I tried to help those ungrateful Albertan's out 
More demonising the oil & gas sector implying they need bailouts 
They do not
That’s just BS 
You’re the problem

Oh she was something.

3479 2018-12-18 19:12:18 Yeah, this is dumb, and almost certainly not conceived of by anyone who has ever lived in an oil and gas area.
3480 2018-12-18 19:11:56 i AM albertan. i have friends and family hit hard by the oil bust, and who really need the pipeline. the whole country’s economy counts on alberta’s resources; this money is an effort to put us back to work, where we all want to be. you need to get out of the way.
3481 2018-12-18 19:11:43 Hi Kimberly, all that is in the popcorn is corn, Rapeseed oil and salt
3482 2018-12-18 19:11:39 And the Oil ?
3483 2018-12-18 19:11:39 That’s how they are going to force the one world government on people. Create the financial gap. Cause a great divide then conquer. Trudeau is already trying it by suppressing the oil industry then try buy it off with “free” money.
3484 2018-12-18 19:11:31 Everyone has the right to be wrong

3487 2018-12-18 19:11:20 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3488 2018-12-18 19:11:19 what do you think how low will oil fall?
3489 2018-12-18 19:11:17 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3490 2018-12-18 19:11:15 U sure that’s all that’s getting changed? Never heard of a 2hour oil change.
3491 2018-12-18 19:11:14 Dozens of donations from oil and gas executives, what could possibly be wrong with that
3492 2018-12-18 19:11:11 How come oil tankers are still allowed in the St. Lawrence?
3493 2018-12-18 19:11:02 Oil spent ~3 months at profitable tight oil economic levels since Q4 2014. It’s not backwards looking, it’s reality. Tell your finance bros to change their messaging and the way they highgrade names and you’ll start to see lower growth.
3494 2018-12-18 19:11:00 Ok, what did everyone else in the league sign? Including all those teams above us? City are a special case as they're paid for by an oil state. How can you make these excuses? The football has been excretable, the players have gone backwards.

3501 2018-12-18 19:10:19 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
3502 2018-12-18 19:10:19 Trump quer Oil barato...tá perdendo a guerra dos carros híbridos para a China e Japão. .
3503 2018-12-18 19:10:04 His myopic perceptions are focused on 6-figure oil incomes in Calgary. 
Everything else is just window dressing and a distraction from what's really important - 6-figure oil incomes in Calgary. #AbLeg #abpoli
3504 2018-12-18 19:10:02 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
3505 2018-12-18 19:10:00 I mean to be honest I probably find it funny because it has a lot of buzzwords in it that makes me think it's a scam. Telling people they'll learn to draw 'mindblowing art' seems a lot like snake oil
3506 2018-12-18 19:09:54 I thought the drop started when oil peaked July 4th 168 ish 2007
Why I took jana partners golfing on the 4th
3507 2018-12-18 19:09:52 Not that I'm disagreeing, per se, but...

If US Shale Oil is an imploding supply bubble, shouldn't the price of oil should be going UP?
3508 2018-12-18 19:09:42 "Why are you guys leaving the aircraft in the middle of this job?"

"Smoke break. We need to put our heads together away from the plane to come up with a fix."

"I'll join you if it means fixing this problem."

*The next morning*

"I did not know I could make that much phlegm"
3509 2018-12-18 19:09:41 There is no pro oil and gas option on the ballot besides the marginal and small Parti conservateur du Québec.
3510 2018-12-18 19:09:30 It's illegal for corporations to donate to federal political campaigns. Beto signed a pledge to not take contributions from executives in the oil industry, but Sludge reviewed FEC records and found that he took money from dozens of oil executives.
3511 2018-12-18 19:09:27 I grew up in Oklahoma and know a lot of people who work in the oil and gas industry. They don’t like it, necessarily, but they’re good paying jobs in a poor area. According to folks like this, they may as well support Republicans.
3512 2018-12-18 19:09:20 if we could convert double-standards into usable energy the republican party would dwarf the oil industry
3513 2018-12-18 19:09:19 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
3514 2018-12-18 19:09:14 Money to diversify away from oil jobs will not help the $80M/day we lose due to the lack of a pipeline. Trudeau gives lefties a reason to shout “oil company welfare” and “Albertans are so whiny! What more do they want?”
What all Canadians need is a productive energy industry.
3515 2018-12-18 19:09:13 Coconut oil bisa maksudnya minyak kelapa biasa atau vco sih mbak. Dua-duanya bisa dipakai. Yg ngebedain mung perkara nutrisi dan harga 

Nek vinegar aja ya itu cuka bakso. Tapi kalau ada embel-embel misalnya balsamic vinegar, apple cider vinegar, dll lha itu beda lagi.
3516 2018-12-18 19:09:12 Amazon got Motor Oil now kmao????
3517 2018-12-18 19:09:05 #WTI < $47.  #Oil
3518 2018-12-18 19:09:04 Excess sugar destroys neural-connections in the brain, weakening cognitive abilities and causing short-term memory loss. Omega-3 fatty acids can reverse this build up - so take your fish oil supplements, and if you're #vegan, take your flax seed supplements! #entrepreneur
3519 2018-12-18 19:09:04 Which market pls this yam alone in ekiti swf is 1000, palm oil is 350, v.oil is 400, rice one plastic is 1500 at ile - market as at today, this potatoes worth 500, spaghetti golden penny is 190 each, tomatoes paste is 430 per roll... That alone is more than N2500  aunty
3520 2018-12-18 19:08:59 @jimrome Do they make patchouli oil scented vapes? Asking for a friend. Regards, Portland Woman
3521 2018-12-18 19:08:49 Me that hasn’t even moisturized in a minute, na baby oil I dey use cos harmattan. Lol
3522 2018-12-18 19:08:42 Soap shop will be open every day till Christmas.
We now have CBD oil available.
3523 2018-12-18 19:08:34 After paying $4.5 billion to Kinder Morgan and committing $10 billion more to reconstruct the old pipeline, Canada today announced another 1.6 billion in oil industry subsidies. This is fighting #climatechange, Liberal style. 
#bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
3524 2018-12-18 19:08:24 That's what the global oil market is saying, not the government. What else do you think is triggering low prices? Witches? Hobgoblins?
3525 2018-12-18 19:08:19 If that's where the jobs are then why would money need to be put into renewables? Answer: Because they're not profitable or efficient and cannot replace oil and gas. That's a pipe dream.
3526 2018-12-18 19:08:17 Bell peppers of multiple colors, mushrooms, hot sauce, the tears of my enemies, thyme, cumin, chili powder, paprika, basil, with a hint of olive oil.
3527 2018-12-18 19:08:14 Finally scheduled this oil change so the dealership can stop calling me 
3528 2018-12-18 19:08:14 Sorry, history contradicts you.

Not all monopolies are in the position of Standard Oil, in which anyone can compete with you once they find the resources. That was an exceptional case.
3529 2018-12-18 19:07:46 Wtfff am I going to do for these two hours while my oil is getting changed  
3530 2018-12-18 19:07:44 NAZ 1405-1571 a/d. Only 1919-1680 on NYSE. Russell 2000 hardly up, Financials act like crap. Oil still crashing. #markets #EasyMoney
3531 2018-12-18 19:07:34 nailed it. who says TA is snake oil? lol
3532 2018-12-18 19:07:31 It's like a block away but it could hit the news cause it looks like something with oil was burning
3533 2018-12-18 19:07:30 : remove makeup if any with dermalogica preclesnse, cleanser Clarisonic, origins toner, FAB cream with origins rose hip oil. : Clarisonic clesnder, Mario bsdescu rose water spray, origins White tea moisturizer with spf 40 and I think it’s origins banana eye cream
3534 2018-12-18 19:07:29 You don't mind the oil subsidies do ya? 

Oh I see your profile says "Christian"
3535 2018-12-18 19:07:24 Target is the easier place honestly because you’ll probably find all those products there! But I get my vitamin e & c oil serum from Marshall’s or TJ maxx depending on who has what
3536 2018-12-18 19:07:20 Getting an oil change at this quick oil change places  and they already sold me on like 2 things I think I need but not sure. Lol smh.
3537 2018-12-18 19:07:08 just to put things in perspective, oil services stocks are down to their post tech-bubble crash lows.... $OIH
3538 2018-12-18 19:06:56 You mean oil fields?
3539 2018-12-18 19:06:55 Thats right. Oil and gas companies need subsidies..  are you kidding me?!?!   Wtf?
3540 2018-12-18 19:06:46 The teeth whitening stuff I see these girls using looks like used motor oil.
3541 2018-12-18 19:06:41 Some useful figures about the 2019 Saudi budget:
About 68 percent of state revenue next year is expected to come from oil. @CapEconomics said this year's budget seems to be relying on optimistic assumptions for oil prices to rise to almost $80 per barrel.
3542 2018-12-18 19:06:40 It's not the government though. 
Fuel duty not gone up in years. 
Blatant profiteering by the oil companies
3543 2018-12-18 19:06:38 Crude Oil trying to reverse off the lows here. 47.59 resistance through that maybe a pop 10 to 20 ticks  47.84 next resistance
3544 2018-12-18 19:06:35 Mom: (timid) "Could you bring me some of that CBD oil on vacation?"
Me: "How about instead some meth, some Goldschlager cinnamon schnapps and an exorcism?"
3545 2018-12-18 19:06:34 That didn't happen in a vacuum. We can't ignore our spendy aughts when we could have invested in retraining/de-commoditizing manufacturing & shoreing up economy instead of embarking on endless oil wars
3546 2018-12-18 19:06:30 Wow  I’d love to rub loads of oil over your amazing body Kerrie xxx 
3547 2018-12-18 19:06:15 And add Oil changes
Air filter changes
Public transit (how to use)
Credit scores
Assets vs. liabilities
We could both go on and on lol

4. Ross From Friends - Family Portrait
5. Sophie - Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-insides
3549 2018-12-18 19:06:10 Nothing new here. Libs and progressives only predict doom. Fear is a great motivator. Oceans would die, we would run out of oil, world starvation, and the biggest hoax of all being climate change. What idiots the climate has always changed in big ways, long before SUVs. 
3550 2018-12-18 19:06:10 people forget that foreign policy can have effects on foreign currency. wars, trade, supply and demand of certain products being supplied, oil crises, foreign and domestic stock exchamge liquidation of state assets, things as simple as speech can effect it. the list is huge!
3551 2018-12-18 19:06:05 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=

3553 2018-12-18 19:05:52 Revolutionary War.

WWII certainly had some merit. But the US establishment (Bush’s grandpa Prescott Bush) actually funded the Nazi’s.

Moreover; US was trying to force Japan to attack by cutting off their oil supply.

Pretty much all wars are started off lies.
3554 2018-12-18 19:05:45 Cutch had to trade him 4 cases of coconut oil.
3555 2018-12-18 19:05:41 Thinking of finally going Xmas shopping today....my gift to myself is my expensive ass oil change for my car
3556 2018-12-18 19:05:37 Total incompetence at the cost to Canadian taxpayers. Sure, why not, just add it to the Kinder Morgan bailout; deeper and deeper in debt. Bailouts;austerity $'s; Khan Caribbean vacations; $10 mil to a known terrorist. I hope Diaper Justin slips on an oil patch and breaks his neck

3560 2018-12-18 19:05:28 dove nourish oil
3561 2018-12-18 19:05:20 So many different sectors of O&G. All affected by outright price of crude oil - including price of gas. The trickle down affect into job market and compensation can take so long you may think they aren’t linked.
3562 2018-12-18 19:05:13 How about a shill for your constituents who want a strong oil and gas sector.
3563 2018-12-18 19:05:11 Who said anything about welfare? We just want a fair market price for our oil, via another pipeline.
3564 2018-12-18 19:05:08 League has never been won before Christmas. The gas and oil valves will be opened at Man City in Jan
3565 2018-12-18 19:05:05 @FelixFracasado en el caso hipotetico, que fueras el presidente de la Fed. Y Trump te manda recados por twetter y prensa que no subas la tasa y los argumentos que te da, es que ya no hay peligro de inflación (oil bajando), pero para tu credibilidad debes subirla. Que harias?
3566 2018-12-18 19:05:02 Chiarelli would add few 1st round picks
3567 2018-12-18 19:04:39 Y’all he literally bought Jamaican black castor oil shampoo/conditioner made sure it was color protect and heat resistantthen gonna give me restoring coconut oilontop of that started singing a song to me right before taking me to eatwhat kinda breed of white man is this?
3568 2018-12-18 19:04:34 Anti-oil agenda? Hmm... I’m cool with that. But Trudeau did buy Alberta a freaking oil pipeline for $4.5B ffs.
3569 2018-12-18 19:04:33 Klairs cleansing oil+ cerave hydrating cleanser to get rid of all the dirt and makeup. Then i go with my la roche posay thermal water, klairs unscented toner and cerave hydrating lotion. Sometimes i add an oil and i use TO's 5% lactic acid 3x a week. Also spf 50 every morning.
3570 2018-12-18 19:04:31 Or, you know, maybe after having 30 years of knowing oil is going to run out and the end is nigh and new sectors are needed to stimulate the economy of Alberta, maybe start worrying about that..... They had 30 years to prepare for this.....
3571 2018-12-18 19:04:29 Olive oil is really good for the skin
3572 2018-12-18 19:04:19 How much global warming came from oil wells burning in Kuwait 4 several months. How much from the forest fires in California Washington Colorado last 20 years. How much from volcanoes. How much from cattle. How much $ are they trying to get from us 4 minuscule results. Trillions
3573 2018-12-18 19:04:01 These idiots talking medical M havent a clue when they talk getting stoned. I have seen first hand what CBD oil can do for adolescent epsilepsy, and nausea and pain from chemo and cancer.  You cant get high on CBD oil, the the M we need.
3574 2018-12-18 19:04:01 Buy frankincense oil from Cortney, put a couple drops in your moisturizer. It'll change your life.
3575 2018-12-18 19:04:01 My lunch is literally a toasted pita with olive oil and a lil garlic and feta. The Greek is truly rubbing off on me
3576 2018-12-18 19:04:01 I want to save $$$ on Xmas gifts so I’m thinking of giving each family member a barrel of oil $USO $OIL  #xmas #genius #savings
3577 2018-12-18 19:04:00 Every car engine depends upon oil for lubrication. Oil that hasn’t been changed regularly thickens and turns to a molasses-like substance. Synthetic oil is a benefit for every vehicle and allows for quicker starts in cold weather.
3578 2018-12-18 19:03:56 Oil bonds and gold suggesting something is very sick in this market
3579 2018-12-18 19:03:56 They are. Correct. Just as are we to gain the port in Syria to control the oil market. Y’all can keep crying about this that and the other...but stop kidding yourselves about the reality. The US wants to illegally invade topple a sovereign country. Illegal. Full@stop
3580 2018-12-18 19:03:42 By that time it will be too late. Countries are still putting their major money into fosil fuel instead of clean energy. The stupid oil companies should invest in clean energy and could still reap the rewards.
3581 2018-12-18 19:03:42 @bitebeauty agave lip mask!!! @HourglassMakeup lip oil!
3582 2018-12-18 19:03:37 Yep, I'm afraid so. Can't even look at myself in the mirror.. 

Coz its in another room.. The same room I keep filled with barrels of Palm Oil and deforestation equipment #Obvs
3583 2018-12-18 19:03:35 Hi Why would you say this and continue to subsidies oil over renewables.  Where is the flood of money going to come from for change? and why are you stacking the deck against that change?Renewables are the way forward and continued development of oil will only hasten disaster!
3584 2018-12-18 19:03:28 However, they deeply underperformed the oil price over the last months. A bad omen. CXO is especially disappointing. It has lost nearly 60% over a few weeks. Not exactly a blue chip. EOG also below 100 had broken important chart support. Even XOM is crashing.
3585 2018-12-18 19:03:23 What resources? If you mean oil that is a British resource and the east of Scotland has had a fine living from it. I think you’ll find that one of the major company’s was BP. British Petroleum. London????
3586 2018-12-18 19:03:23 I wonder what the orders to those troops will be when the food, oil, medicines and money runs out? 
#c4news
3587 2018-12-18 19:03:20 If it really goes to $10...the price of oil will be the last thing you are concerned about.
3588 2018-12-18 19:03:17 #Europe Close: Europe's resistance gave way, in last hour of trading, despite an upbeat trend at the Wall Street. Primarily, caution & risk-off ahead of Fed & pressure on Oil curbed any enthusiasm. #CAC +0.95% 4.754.08 #DAX -0.29% 10,740.89 #FTSE -1.06% 6,701.59. WSE: $PEO +4.5%.
3589 2018-12-18 19:03:12 Texas is a failed state. Doubling down their dependency on oil and gas is a loser's bet.
3590 2018-12-18 19:03:09 Also, can we find out which oil and gas companies and the cosy links between PEPANZ, NZ Energy Voices and MBIE's New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals unit?
3591 2018-12-18 19:03:08 Crude oil futures for Jan/Feb even lower Tuesday afternoon, $WTI_Crude -5.41% at $47.18 & $NBZ_F -4.21% at $57.10, $USO -4.11% at $10.02 on 12/18/2018.
3592 2018-12-18 19:03:08 Barrels of oil are crashing and I better not see ang gas station raising prices this week.
3593 2018-12-18 19:03:04 The real magician I Stan.

3594 2018-12-18 19:02:59 #NaturalGas Profits. SHORT rallies in NG. I took a SHORT position $3.73. NG to $3.00. Look what traders did to WTI oil SHORT. @jonnajarian @petenajarian @CNBCFuturesNow @CNBCFastMoney @AnthonyGriz @ScottNations @HalftimeReport @jimcramer @OptionsAction @jimcramer @jimiuorio
3595 2018-12-18 19:02:58 Given the finite nature of oil I’d say there is! Albeit a long one!

3597 2018-12-18 19:02:48 My secret squirrel oil change spot ain't so secrety today
3598 2018-12-18 19:02:44 Sorry Brian! It's not 1974 anymore.  If IPIECA is going to advise on Indigenous social issues in the Oil and Gas industry, you need to include Indigenous People as decision makers.  I'm in London on 22 Feb.  Let's talk .#indigenous
3599 2018-12-18 19:02:41 Yesterday I checked a guy’s oil, he was low so I went in there store bought a quart put it in then filled his tank and I got no tip 
3600 2018-12-18 19:02:40 "Ang saya mo pala kausap no" sana oil 
3601 2018-12-18 19:02:36 Getting my oil changed in Norfolk wearing Seminole gear and ran into a homie of Derrick Nnadi. Spent 1/2 an hour talking about how great THE Florida State University is. We’re everywhere folks. #GoNoles
3602 2018-12-18 19:02:25 Is it better to tax oil being used to manufacture plastics or subsidize recycled plastics? It's still generally cheaper to make new plastic than to use recycled plastics
3603 2018-12-18 19:02:08 Bruhhh, you have to wait for like a fat ass week or two (depends on the size) so the oil paint sets and dries!! Then you slap varnish on that bad boiii
3604 2018-12-18 19:02:07 Well the results are in and the gas boiler installations are double the oil boiler installation this year, quite a change from last year.
Thank you to @baxiboilers @Vedette35 for all your help and support.
3605 2018-12-18 19:02:05 Who would want to participate in a infomercial for lead tainted snake oil? You lead tainted snake oil salesman and convictionless hack.
3606 2018-12-18 19:02:02 Once again repubs are taking apart the things to keep 2008 from happening again. Market volatility today is due to trump & his instabilities, causing unknowns to cloud crystal balls. His rants about interest rates, oil prices, etc. speak volumes about his lack of knowledge!
3607 2018-12-18 19:02:02 No
3608 2018-12-18 19:02:00 A man knows who his heart belongs to so you can cook his food in diamond oil & do backflips on his dick but if it ain't you it ain't you
3609 2018-12-18 19:01:56 Crude oil could fall to $45
3610 2018-12-18 19:01:56 His arguments fail to mention that BC is “west” of Alberta, is is the main block on moving bitumen by pipeline.    And as much as Eastern Canada’s anti pipeline stance is getting blamed for all the griping, if oil was $100 a barrel, you wouldnt hear a pip.
3611 2018-12-18 19:01:55 Y’all. I ain’t gon lie, the man changing my oil is fine. I can’t figure out if he’s white or black. 
3612 2018-12-18 19:01:53 You forgot fish oil. And beer.
3613 2018-12-18 19:01:51 See? We do have something in common! Unfortunately political parties are our only option at this time & the liberals and NDP have proven themselves to be against our oil & gas industry!
3614 2018-12-18 19:01:48 If he had left Kinder Morgan in the hands of professionals, where it belonged, and not shut it down, we'd have another 4 billion dollars for the oil patch.
3615 2018-12-18 19:01:46 i'm curious did he deny that all the star players are still being impeded and not getting calls or did he single out McDavid?
3616 2018-12-18 19:01:46 I really didn't start using oil blotting sheets until this year. I was truly living in the ghetto.
3617 2018-12-18 19:01:42 I bought orange scented essential oil at Target, put a few drops in a spray bottle filled with water and misted my tree. (Most) cats hate citrus scent and stay away. It's cheap, easy, non toxic, and smells good to humans . #catsinchristmastrees
3618 2018-12-18 19:01:42 With Oil price crashing due to threats from President Trump, global terrorism funding will dry down drastically now..as OPEC Islamic nations have no surplus left to spend on global Jihad. Good for oil importing countries like India.
 @realDonaldTrump should get Noble peace prize.
3619 2018-12-18 19:01:41 Go get ‘em  boys! Go Oil Caps Go!
3620 2018-12-18 19:01:37 I’ve been avoiding getting my oil changed for like 3 weeks now :/
3621 2018-12-18 19:01:35 Stop trying to blame some puppet President....Israel wants Syria and Iran for the oil and gas resources. Basically.

3623 2018-12-18 19:01:32 The hell is clean coal? When I was referring to use oil and coal effectively I was referring to something similar to hybrid cars or something like that, balance.
3624 2018-12-18 19:01:32 One hopes those subsidies go to alternative energy startups and CO2-reducing initiatives rather than MORE subsidies to oil and gas. It's fair to say that oil and gas have had all the help in Alberta they deserve. Those workers need jobs in industries that have a future.
3625 2018-12-18 19:01:18 @SabonNYC Hi there!  Are any of your olive oil soap products unscented?
3626 2018-12-18 19:01:15 Speak for yourself.!not near as dirty as sudia oil!
3627 2018-12-18 19:01:15 Americas economy is falling apart, partially because of the wars for oil that cost TRILLIONS of dollars. Green can power cities...and does power cities! You dont know what youre talking about
3628 2018-12-18 19:01:05 The situation in Canada is whacky, with the Liberal gov pushing a carbon tax and saying the right things while simultaneously buying oil pipelines and lendng 1.6 billion to bail out the oil industry. It's maddening.
3629 2018-12-18 19:01:04 How about you keep “your” (actually our) cash and we build some pipelines east and west instead? Also, ditch all the handcuffs placed by the liberals that apply only to Canadian O&G resources (I.e. the tanker ban and bill c69) and allow us to be competitive again. Ban saudi oil.

3664 2018-12-18 18:58:19 A federal handout is proof the Liberals are not listening or don't care. Trudeau is clearly in over his head with this leading the country fantasy. The puppet master, Butts, is following through with the destruction of oil & gas in Canada. They were successful eliminating coal.
3665 2018-12-18 18:58:19 Chinese should get their ass out of South Sudan. They were not our friends during liberation war and  can't enjoy our oil at the expense of our true friends and allies who stood with us at most difficult times. They were aiding our enemies in bombing us.

So instead of comparing female oil field worker to male oil field worker ; they compare male oil field worker to female daycare worker. The female in this case will make way less money skewing the results
3669 2018-12-18 18:57:50 Well, you were living in the middle of the Little Ice Age and had yet to discover the real potential of coal, oil and gas.

More demonising the oil & gas sector implying they need bailouts 
That’s just BS
3673 2018-12-18 18:57:10 The Canadian government has decided to provide 1.6 billion in loans to Alberta's oil and gas sector. Does this seem prudent given the climate crises? Where is the green energy bail out after Ford axed Ontario's programs? Does this seem sane? @viraniarif @cathmckenna
3674 2018-12-18 18:56:41 Sooo I went to get my oil changed and realized I never took the purse of beer out of my truck. I’m also pretty sure the purse is wide open, so at this point I’m just waiting for them to give my keys back and mention something  ...oops

3676 2018-12-18 18:56:33 Maybe ask the Saudis to pay for it since we import so much of their oil. Or just stop shipping Alberta oil and gas to BC. 
3677 2018-12-18 18:56:28 Also use hair glue so if you mess up, you put a dab of oil on your fingers and take them off without pulling your lashes off.
3678 2018-12-18 18:56:22 The world is using 100 million barrels of oil per day. Next year will be a million more. And the idiot Trudeau wants to shut down our energy industry. Why aren’t the idiots at CTV brave enough to call him out. #PaidNews

3685 2018-12-18 18:55:36 Oil,NaturalGas,RenewableEnergy and Hydroelectricity all IMPORTANT in Canada's past and future.

3721 2018-12-18 18:52:05 Trump made a deal with Saudi Arabia for oil by the barrel.. That is the only reason it’s $1.99 a gallon. At Hy-Vee you can get gas without Ethanol for .30 cents more a gallon. I bought ten gallon of it for my small engines. Small older engines get destroyed by ethanol
3722 2018-12-18 18:52:02 Alberta sells for 1/5th of the world price... even when they're not high, Alberta and Canada would benefit from selling OUR oil at market price, not a devastating discount like we been doing.

3758 2018-12-18 18:48:23 Oil is dropping which means that cos will feel the bleed beginning in the 2nd quarter 2019.  Lower profits will result in lower tax revenues.  Lower profits usually create layoffs.  Hopefully you are creating an economy that offsets the potential loss ahead.  I doubt it though.

Who shat on Scotland more?
Tory? Labour?
3774 2018-12-18 18:46:30 Well JT bought it from transmountain so it will be going through. The real factor is oil prices.  If those were still high, Alberta would be ok.

3777 2018-12-18 18:46:15 Let me see: if you take money from the oil companies you do not take environmentalism seriously and the implication is you are not a good person? Well I guess the thousands of people who work for them should quit immediately and all charities should return the donated money.

3782 2018-12-18 18:45:54 Its misleading to say Beto took "fossil fuel money" - they were donations from people employed in the oil and gas industry (by law, all givers must state the industry in which they work), which is potentially very different from taking corporate PAC money
3783 2018-12-18 18:45:51 today I paid to get my oil changed, car inspected, and my puppies shots, is this what it’s like being an adult?

3790 2018-12-18 18:45:01 I still say it would be cheaper to shut down the Alberta oil fields and simply pay the workers a living wage until more jobs opened up… preferably in GREEN energy… and there's all sorts of oil field clean up that needs to be done… Someone has to do that! Jobs!

3811 2018-12-18 18:42:44 Also you aren't being forced to give up oil production? You have the federal gov't buying a pipeline to ensure viability and now giving $1.6-billion to combat what low oil prices have done. The ROC cares and wants to help but, like, some people don't want the pipelines bro.
3812 2018-12-18 18:42:43 If more oil and natural gas are needed, then we are totally screwed. But that's your business model, isn't it? Screwing people for as long as possible to make money that won't insulate you from the consequences of climate change.

3823 2018-12-18 18:42:03 The Saudis require $85 a barrel to balance their budget. Today oil is $47 a barrel. Serious problems for them if oil prices stay at this level or even worse if fall. One silver lining may be that more Saudis will start to work if the govt is unable to give generous allowances.

3836 2018-12-18 18:40:49 Russia:  Keep in mind that Russian economy is smaller than Canada and Australia, etc. Only thing that really matters to them is Higher Oil Prices! Russian political interests are furthered by green politicians opposed to drilling, fracking and pipelines. (Trump??)

3877 2018-12-18 18:37:16 Here's an idea.

There are lots of natural gas properties in NE BC: A lot of Montney stuff. The Calgary based oil companies should start firing any worker or contractor who's a resident of BC, and shipping in unemployed Alberta workers to replace them.

3880 2018-12-18 18:37:00 mais oil - poudre du marche
3881 2018-12-18 18:36:59 40 years later and “the oil is running out and the price is going down.” Sadly, too many Scots are content to put up with Westminster lies and rule. It’s shameful actually.
3882 2018-12-18 18:36:55 How about we stop getting oil from the U.S. 80% of all import comes from there.
3883 2018-12-18 18:36:50 As if the writing wasn’t already on the wall, oil is last century, Albertans can retrain for modern jobs
3884 2018-12-18 18:36:45 So, strange that. A 19.6% PC increase in spending in fiscal 2013-4 (the downturn in the price of oil began in mid-2014) was no problem but a 5% NDP increase in spending in a real downturn is a problem.
3885 2018-12-18 18:36:37 Just went deep into a thread about giving up dairy but then people argued vegan options aren’t good for the environment and kill bees like every alternative had a down side so for my part I’m choosing to save the chimpanzees get ya unsustainably sourced palm oil out my face
3886 2018-12-18 18:36:31 Also CBD oil is a fricking life saver.
3887 2018-12-18 18:36:27 Ryan Zinke was a pawn for the oil and gas industry as you are! Total disregard for serving for the greater good - the next generation will hate you!!!!!!
3888 2018-12-18 18:36:19 No diamonds, just oil 
3889 2018-12-18 18:36:15 何故かとても眠いのです。
3890 2018-12-18 18:36:06 Oil!
3891 2018-12-18 18:36:01 This!!!!
3892 2018-12-18 18:35:50 Tooth and lots of garlic and tea tree oil.
3893 2018-12-18 18:35:48 Yes indeed!  WTI oil is going to spring back over $55 soon and drag $HAL with it!  We just need to wait a tick for production to cut back a little and have a little unrest and then all is well my dear! 
3894 2018-12-18 18:35:47 I hate working home but it has its perks like doing face masks during the fay & olive oil hair treatments without worrying who’s gonna see you
3895 2018-12-18 18:35:46 That castor oil nonsense is exactly that, nonsense! 
I still don't have a healthy hairline. Mxm.
3896 2018-12-18 18:35:18 They are all the scum of the earth. Using our money for oil wars around the world when people are dying on the streets. Homelessness figures rising, in a Christian country??? No Christians in government.
3897 2018-12-18 18:35:12 Her motor could do with soaking in white spirit or some other quick drying cleaner. I imagine that's 20-30 years old old lubricating oil making it's way into the motor.
3898 2018-12-18 18:35:04 Explain to Albertans why the NDP is receiving money from the TIDES FOUNDATION. THE TIDES HAS BEEN AT WAR WITH ALBERTA OIL FOR A LONG TIME. I will wait for you’re response.
3899 2018-12-18 18:35:03 I am sick of people taking money from oil companies and corrupt bankers and war criminals so they can tell us what "liberals" should think.  The habitat is collapsing hon.  They aren't going to be bathrooms soon.
3900 2018-12-18 18:34:57 Give Trump credit - he engineered oil down via KSA and that took the keys away from the Fed - if the Fed has to allow labor to gain share of the pie to defend the cycle - he wins there too
3901 2018-12-18 18:34:56 LMAO! But there are so many better reasons to dislike me.
3902 2018-12-18 18:34:55 Hey A/V and tech people: for a home audio system, is a power line conditioner a necessary part of a system, snake oil, or something in between? Feels like overkill to me, like "gold plated, high performance" HDMI cables, but could use some wisdom from the interwebs. Thanks!
3903 2018-12-18 18:34:46 @JonnyBones LET'S FUCKING GO!! DECEMBER 29TH!!! BEAT HIS MOTHERFUCKING ASS!!!.. HE HAD ON BABY OIL!! THAT'S WHY YOU COULDN'T GRAB HIM WITH HIS BABY ASS!!! FUCK HIM UP JON!!! #ENDICOTT #BING
3904 2018-12-18 18:34:40 I'm getting paid to look out my Bay and day dream about what the oil field is breaking and what I get to fix next. Lol So Bored
3905 2018-12-18 18:34:37 I think that's common for small engines with separate oil.

In my lawnmowers that have used a single gasoline/oil blend, I've always used regular.

In my Deere lawn tractor with separate gasoline and oil supplies, high-octane is recommended by the engine manufacturer.
3906 2018-12-18 18:34:35 Thank You, But My Everyday Salad Sounds Boring In Comparison. Also Do Homemade Olive Oil & Lemon, Balsamic & Dijon Dressings.
3907 2018-12-18 18:34:35 If it wasn't for our oil .....
3908 2018-12-18 18:34:18 Castor oil
3909 2018-12-18 18:34:08 Yes because they need so much natural resources until the world turned green they have well over a billion people.  But they know the world will turn green which is why they invested that much money in green tech.  Trump? Only invests in oil and coal
3910 2018-12-18 18:34:04 Oh you mean like when she supports single payer and wants to stop oil companies running the government.  Yeah, that's awful.   We wouldn't want THAT!
3911 2018-12-18 18:34:00 334
3912 2018-12-18 18:33:59 My central heating oil went from 47p/litre to 54p this last week....
3913 2018-12-18 18:33:52 Saw on network tv 2 months ago a modest motel room that caters to oil field hands in Midland TX goes for $300 a night. What we have here is absurdity! TY for the great info!
3914 2018-12-18 18:33:44 Yeah, quitting cigs is one decision I don't regret. I was coughing a bit too much for someone in his 20s.
3915 2018-12-18 18:33:32 I wonder about his motives 
If he's looking for votes from Alberta he's dreaming
I think it’s more for optics  
Look Canada  I tried to help out those ungrateful Albertan's 
More demonising of the oil & gas sector implying they need bailouts 
That’s just BS 
He’s the problem
3916 2018-12-18 18:33:21 Can't we have both oil and weed?
3917 2018-12-18 18:33:20 What inflation oil is at 47 a barrel
3918 2018-12-18 18:33:16 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
3919 2018-12-18 18:33:15 Oil is out green is in get used to it.

3922 2018-12-18 18:32:52 Anyone here who has used castor oil for hairgrow?
3923 2018-12-18 18:32:51 Given that Quebec doesn't want Alberta oil, it's only fair that Alberta boycotts SNC-Lavalin for all infrastructure projects!
3924 2018-12-18 18:32:50 Okay pay attention.  You support corrupt bankers.  You concede to Republicans every chance you get.  You're against single payer, and you make no effort to address climate change, along with taking money from oil companies.  We're done with it.  That's how it works.
3925 2018-12-18 18:32:44 riding around like my oil ain’t on 4%

3928 2018-12-18 18:32:20 @riteaid do you guys do oil changes?
3929 2018-12-18 18:32:16 also using coconut oil on its own really helps if theyre sore x
3930 2018-12-18 18:32:00 Yeah... NO. In no way whatsoever would anyone who knows anything about oil compare WCS to ANY of those in the Opec Basket. I know waking up from Dreamland sucks, but it's actually net positive for mental health.

3933 2018-12-18 18:31:36 who can continue to support Trudeau, large deficits/debt, open border policy wasting billions on illegals, shutting down the oil industry, giving away billions to other countries, signing of the UN immigration compact, must be too stoned in their parents basement
3934 2018-12-18 18:31:34 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. We’ve sat back over the years watching liberals hold their protests & so forth. Is it time for us of the silent majority hit the streets with our concerns for America? 1st day of spring 2019 hold a city by city peaceful march! 

Just a thought
3935 2018-12-18 18:31:29 @Ford Truck has been in the shop almost a month now. Was told recalls, oil change, & cabin filter would be 2 days but they had to hold my truck for a tech to fix the awful SYNC system. Truck is just sitting there. Why am I paying for something that Ford is just holding onto?

3937 2018-12-18 18:31:24 And the oil stayed. The oil didn't run out, the vessels were all used up, more empty vessels, more oil..

3938 2018-12-18 18:31:22 Working full time means skipping lunch with coworkers to instead get your oil changed & car inspected 
3939 2018-12-18 18:31:21 I drop those CBD oil bath bombs in the tub all the time. Love it so yes. Yes it is.
3940 2018-12-18 18:31:18 Ok. I get it then. But was also fishing to see if anyone could tie Big Oil to the UN objectives.

Not for the wall or oil pipelines, but the one for roads, public transportation, and city plumbing/sewage updates?
3945 2018-12-18 18:30:25 I like to make a tofu burger!
Drain and press the tofu. cut into roughly burger bun sized squares. Cover them in cornstarch! Fry in very hot pan with little oil till very crispy. turn down the heat and throw in some spring onion/ginger/garlic and sweet chilli sauce!

3948 2018-12-18 18:30:21 It's a bait and switch. And it's to deflect from true intent of liberals to destroy the oil industry

3950 2018-12-18 18:30:12 My parents would kill me, considering we're holding my uncle's funeral this week. He went to the VA Hospital in October for a scheduled back surgery, came back w/ a diagnosis of Stage 4 lung cancer, spread to lymph nodes & bone. Still tempting, though...
3951 2018-12-18 18:30:11 Ahh yes you know all those voters who were just begging for the crude export ban to be lifted and who wanted a new oil boom in the Permian Basin. Most voters I've talked to list expiditing construction of LNG export terminals as their number one issue
3952 2018-12-18 18:30:09 So what exactly do they use to pay for the imported petroleum products like gas and oil that are shipped in?
3953 2018-12-18 18:30:04 Yep this is exactly it - perhaps no more oil job for every one just far fewer so need to go to plan B
3954 2018-12-18 18:30:03 Is CPB oil straight edge
3955 2018-12-18 18:29:54 Things I’ve learned sitting at lunch. “Saudi Arabia has all of the extra oil” and “Vera is now buying elastic waist pants and they’re on sale for $6 at Macy’s” and “Susan needs to get a credit card”
3956 2018-12-18 18:29:50 Again, oil has given the Fed the best cover EVER! They will hike 25 bps, and then litter their statement with a super dovish tone. They will concentrate on inflation pressures waning and focus less on weak growth.

I once wrote a status on Facebook about how my former helper made magwinya with  all the extra virgin olive oil & someone told me to voetsek and not employ people I can’t afford 
3963 2018-12-18 18:29:17 Unless it's for the oil companies. And Big Banks. And Big Pharma. And Big Insurance. Then conservatives are all for socialism.

3975 2018-12-18 18:29:02 @JustinTrudeau are this clueless?  Instead of buying oil from the Middle East why don’t you try supporting your own country! You are the problem. #VoteTrudeauOut  is the only way to fix this.
3976 2018-12-18 18:29:01 very surprising that he mostly endorses solutions that also enrich fossil fuel interests (eg nukes, enhanced oil recovery etc)
3977 2018-12-18 18:29:01 А газ - дедушка!?
3978 2018-12-18 18:28:49 What was a mistake was our spending $5 trillion on trying to occupy Iraq and steal their oil rather than on R& D to keep a big lead in high-value capital goods for which a growing China would have had increased demand. The money the Chinese lent us was used on war.
3979 2018-12-18 18:28:49 @ryanjespersen  sending oil down a 60 mph “pipeline” above ground is a mistake compared to a pipeline in the ground. Its like sending your Christmas letter via snail mail instead of email! Regards, Brad Boettger Tofield farmer ex Petroleum engineer.
3980 2018-12-18 18:28:07 I also like a little bit of pine flavour - in cocktails for instance. Also had venison once that was drizzled with a pine oil and it was delicious. These crisps are a crime though.

4000 2018-12-18 18:26:21 Correct. Again, the big picture. Mining natural gas involves fracking which leads to all sorts of environmental problems. And bunker fuel #5 (oil) is used predominately in all the boiler water power plants on the West coast in Southern California from San Diego to Manhatten Beach

4018 2018-12-18 18:24:17 @Valvoline I’m not sure I’ve ever paid as much for an oil change as I’ve paid at your place. Even at the dealership they haven’t charged me this much.
4019 2018-12-18 18:24:15 Oil diffuser, tea light holders, candles are always a win
4020 2018-12-18 18:24:15 Yeah, I've found ignorance is not only bliss, it's temporary.
I'm optimistic because I am a successful activist.
As I mentioned, my work protected (28, I believe) mobilehome parks locally which are under attack from park owner developers

& I helped stop Big Oil from fracking us.
4021 2018-12-18 18:24:15 Convince me how the world will transition away from fossil fuels and halve emissions in 12 years. Considering 70+% of our energy currently is coal, gas, oil which took over 100 years to build the sector and grid. 

If you think it's possible in 12 you're the denier.
4022 2018-12-18 18:24:09 All that matters is the cost to get the oil delivered to the refinery's doorstep. If Alberta's is cheaper, then great, use it. If foreign is cheaper, use that. Anything else seems like warmed-over NEP, subsidies and economic illiteracy
4023 2018-12-18 18:24:07 cuticle oil helps to strengthen and hydrate!
4024 2018-12-18 18:23:54 Merry Christmas!  We provide contract personnel in support of all facets of the upstream oil & gas business.  We are looking forward to 2019 !
4025 2018-12-18 18:23:48 I told that bitch not to put that got damn coconut oil in my hair. 

I’m gonna have a BF
4026 2018-12-18 18:23:42 just wait til we bring whale oil back online, and see how this economy jets into super hyper overdrive!
4027 2018-12-18 18:23:40 I'm doing an oil painting for the first time in like a year and it's of Jimin and so far oof I'm happy with it
4028 2018-12-18 18:23:25 Put them on a pan, splash them with a little oil, reheat them in the oven until crisp, and add some seasoning. That is what I do with fries and taste pretty good.
4029 2018-12-18 18:23:18 I don't have a real beard. I have just enough beard to build up lather and use like 2 drops of beard oil... 

...but if you think I ain't out here copping Velvet Nior sales like I got Ross’ beard
4030 2018-12-18 18:23:15 Nah that ain't gonna work. At least a free oil change.
4031 2018-12-18 18:23:08 why has this CNY contract resulted in lower oil in USD's?

4034 2018-12-18 18:22:52 Pff obviously he's trying to take the oil out of the invisible fried onion ring  
4035 2018-12-18 18:22:40 ..... try this instead of those...... 1cm of brandy in a mug, top up with hot water. One Big Spoon of honey and stir until honey has dissolved ...... sip before bed...... you’ll sleep like a log!
..... That and olbas oil on the pillow.... 
4036 2018-12-18 18:22:31 I need to apply oil replacement but hell yeh feeling too lazy for getting up.
4037 2018-12-18 18:22:29 I will take up smoking again if need be.
4038 2018-12-18 18:22:22 Another pseudo-science nutjob selling snake oil on @KTLAMorningNews, go figure.
4039 2018-12-18 18:21:57 No, that's ok. I'll just use the blood, sweat and tears of excess oil sands workers to lubricate my alternative energy sources.
4040 2018-12-18 18:21:57 @twospoonslondon loving the lack of festive music. Oh and the neck oil is great too...

4043 2018-12-18 18:21:24 Little side note : most corn sold for biofuel and animal feed now. More money in it. Extra subsidies for these programs. There is no oversight. Subsidies given for land unplanted, same land now has pipelines going thru,so millions being earned from oil industry at same time.
4044 2018-12-18 18:21:23 Why is the Canadian government getting involved in financing the oil sector? @JustinTrudeau
4045 2018-12-18 18:21:20 WHERE IS THIS OIL TRUCK
4046 2018-12-18 18:21:16 I literally moved my head and there’s still dandruff coming out. Like BC SHE DIDNT FUCKING OIL MY SCALP.
4047 2018-12-18 18:21:12 can't rid my self of the kerosene smell. I want to fight the person who spilled oil paint in the freaking house
4048 2018-12-18 18:21:01 CBD oil daily on my body directly for pain!
4049 2018-12-18 18:20:56 There is no demand for Alberta's product.  There is a worldwide glut of supply. Hence the low price and producers starting to withdraw. Blasting oil out tar sand is more expensive than just having it shoot up out of a hole - ready to refine.
4050 2018-12-18 18:20:55 With em baby oil 
4051 2018-12-18 18:20:35 I’d much rather see us sell a million barrels at $50/bbl than 10 million at $15/bbl - oil companies were cleaning up at $100+ per barrel, without a pipeline. We should simply set a minimum price marker and say “we ain’t selling for less”.  Our product has value, and we own it.
4052 2018-12-18 18:20:33 1.6 billion for Alberta's oil & gas industry?? Were you and your colleagues not paying attention at #COP24 @cathmckenna ? Pay attention to the #ExtinctionRebellion and redirect those funds to a #GreenEconomy. @GreenEconomyCa has some ideas if you don't.
4053 2018-12-18 18:20:30 All I want for Christmas is a personal genie in a bottle(oil lamp actually, they look nicer) to grant me unlimited amounts of wishes.    #AllIWantForChristmasIs
4054 2018-12-18 18:20:23 That’s rich.  Now oil is a benefit to the entire country...yet most of the time Albertans whine about transfer payments to other parts of the country
4055 2018-12-18 18:20:19 And when we look in the mirror, what kind of revelation should we have?

A lot of non-Alberta people who use a lot of oil, and enjoy tax benefits from the sale of Alberta oil, seem to offer nothing but roadblocks to Alberta moving its oil.  They're acting hypocritically.
4056 2018-12-18 18:20:13  oil
4057 2018-12-18 18:20:11 Alberta will not get out of the oil & gas business, we will get out of the Ottawa business & seek new opportunities! We’re losing $80,000,000 per day because of their HELP! 1.6 billion is comparable to dropping two pennies in a piggy bank. Probably for Notley’s re-election fund!
4058 2018-12-18 18:20:07 Better hurry up here @BasildonCouncil you do not want Mr. Blackery here grumpy and dirty!! Might cause a heated discussion. 
UK boiler,, gas, oil or electric ?

4060 2018-12-18 18:19:55 US is now the largest producer of oil for the first time since 1973.
4061 2018-12-18 18:19:49 total capitulation in oil - 40s then 30s - avoiding all oil stocks - peeps still think we are in 80 buck territory - we're not!!
4062 2018-12-18 18:19:31 Accidentally stepped in some oil paint that the someone overturned at home this morning.......
4063 2018-12-18 18:19:28 It's not only a completly false Argument, it's also off-course: just bc 500 yrs or 100 yrs ago ppl burned coal + oil as quick + easy energy source doesn't mean we have to Keep doing, esp. now that solar power plants cost less to build than coal plants!
4064 2018-12-18 18:19:22 2019 Will Be A Wild Year For Oil
 
There are a litany of variables that will have enormous impact on oil as we head into 2019, on both the supply side and the demand side, both bullish and bearish for prices...
4065 2018-12-18 18:19:12 #Brent: $57.32 (-3.84%)

It's really good latex paint but it's latex paint

For indoor walls you want to use oil based paint
4068 2018-12-18 18:19:07 I bought an oil diffuser today for my room and honestly it smells so gooooooodddddddd, and also I finally got a fluffy jacket I have been wanting forever lol, but I also bought some succulents and later on I'm going to redo my room lol
4069 2018-12-18 18:19:07 I actually don't work in the oil and gas sector. What I see is what this self-induced downturn has done to my friend, and the community at large.
Being mostly a pragmatics, I can agree with your concerns, and I think we could do better, but what is the alternative to Alberta Oil?
4070 2018-12-18 18:19:07 some foods just have too much oil and i'm sensitive!
4071 2018-12-18 18:19:02 So, just a question. IF (and I say IF) you became PM, how would you go about the people who DON'T want a pipeline? Who want to try and keep the coast safe from oil spills? Hmm?? Just curious? I doubt very much you have an answer.

4074 2018-12-18 18:18:50 He has a hard time holding his nose on this.
Tough comments on plea , as presented, perfectly justified.
Doesn't mean he thinks they are factual.
4075 2018-12-18 18:18:50 The oil industry will be dead within 2 decades.  Don't waste tax money on it.  Let it die.
4076 2018-12-18 18:18:20 Ramsay Bolton needed to be dipped slowly in oil, his skin peeled off, body parts chopped off thennnn fed to dogs - he is fuckin nuts.

4080 2018-12-18 18:18:01 thanks - so its not the oil paints per se, but the thinners for them.
4081 2018-12-18 18:17:57 So we should assume that despite the @albertaNDP stance that they support Oil & Gas they in fact do not, by the same logic that despite the @Alberta_UCP  insistence they aren't racist they in fact are? Guess that's why I can't vote either.

More demonising the oil & gas sector implying they need bailouts 
The truth is HE is the problem
4088 2018-12-18 18:17:11 I never thought at the age of 24 I’d be in the oil field. Let alone a boss over grown men. Never thought I’d have my shit together. Never thought I’d own my own truck and land and cows. But it’s all coming together and I’m thankful 
4089 2018-12-18 18:17:07 I would still like to see some Wall St. bankers, oil execs, big pharma execs, K St. lobbyists, insurance co. execs, etc. get locked up.

4095 2018-12-18 18:16:35 I also suggest you research historical records from a time they were properly accounted, which predates any Oil boom. Finding out about "unknown region" will also be helpful to cast doubt on your convictions (circa £30bn per annum not allocated as Scottish GDP) etc.

4108 2018-12-18 18:15:14 Well, I know one thing for sure, that money could be invested anywhere in Green Tech, so they are not doing Alberta any favors. What we need is to get our Oil and Gas sector working.

4110 2018-12-18 18:15:05 Alberta’s oil is a benefit to the entire country if it was able to be transported to the coasts via pipeline. The small picture view so many people seem to have is astounding. Transfer payments, higher dollar, high paying jobs. No foreign oil coming in would be nice too

4121 2018-12-18 18:13:59 Sohi isn’t giving Alberta anything. Liberals will provide LOANs that will be useless and unable to pay back because Alberta cannot get oil to a coast. Any coast. Next step: Gov’t seizes oil and gas industry, just like Venezuela.

4134 2018-12-18 18:12:15 I support renewables, but I also recognise their limitations. The technology is not feasible for reliable widespread energy. It's been around for 40 years. Only thing that's changes is a bit of technology. Support our Oil & Gas. It's not like we're not using the damm stuff!!
4135 2018-12-18 18:12:07 How can it be ailing?  We all need energy. Most of us do not produce our own energy and have to buy it.  You would think energy would be the best frigging industry in the world as far as making money.  If oil isn’t working out for us maybe we should try something else??

4145 2018-12-18 18:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: sad crust with wet coconut oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
4146 2018-12-18 18:10:58 Stocks are up around 1% Tuesday after they plunged almost 4% over the previous two days. Industrials, tech and sellers of consumer non-essentials are climbing. US crude oil is down another 5% on concerns supplies continue to climb.
4147 2018-12-18 18:10:50 I need to get an oil changed
4148 2018-12-18 18:10:31 Federal Govt holds press conference announcing funding, new energy projects, loans and jobs trainin for Alberta oil and gas workers.

AB conservatives: we don’t want your stinking libtard money!
4149 2018-12-18 18:10:27 Cleanse: yes to black charcoal soap  tone with: ACV+water 1:1 ratio or witch hazel  moisturize: pure jojoba oil
4150 2018-12-18 18:10:22 The perpetual buiding of US tight oil DUC's confirms US drillers lack of discipline.  That capital should have been partially returned to shareholders instead?  Market correct not to trust the US sector's bogus capital discipline.
4151 2018-12-18 18:10:16 Where's the gem for Oil and Special Interests?
4152 2018-12-18 18:10:12 Yes terrific. Canada was carbon negative before you took that seat!  Keep lobbying against the big polluters like China, India & Arab oil! What?  You’re not? Tax Canadians to supplement polluting nations instead?  How obtuse. #cdnpoli
4153 2018-12-18 18:10:08 Even without my specs I can see you.  I should take that snake oil back.
4154 2018-12-18 18:10:02 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
4155 2018-12-18 18:09:46 supply the oil and pan to cook food in. send the seeds and voice they’re from heaven
4156 2018-12-18 18:09:41 lemme rub some teak oil on them elbows, girl
4157 2018-12-18 18:09:30 Patchouli oil smells like dirt.  I love it. 
4158 2018-12-18 18:09:26 @RachelNotley Lie about it all you want. Alberta oil is the dirtiest fuel currently still produced. Why not act like a real leader and lead the way to the future, not con your way back to the past.
4159 2018-12-18 18:09:26 Как покатилась, так и поднимется.
4160 2018-12-18 18:09:23 I just spent $80 on toys and catnip oil for the cat and the little bitch has been playing with a SmartWater bottle cap she found for the last hour. 

Oh, and she hates catnip. 
What even is this cat?
4161 2018-12-18 18:09:04 Oil being where it is is good. It gets too high and demand slacks off. Nice price like this is sustainable, as you can tell by the gas prices. Also, as gas is a separately traded commodity, it has its own conditions on price that aren’t always related to price of oil. My take.
4162 2018-12-18 18:09:00 Omg same! I feel like when I was using the kiehls facial cream it didn’t flake as bad. Also try the Mario Badescu Vitamin c oil before the lotion. 
You can get free Mario Badescu samples and a $10 gift card if you sign up before your birthday!
4163 2018-12-18 18:08:58 Read that again, carefully. You will find that thousands of additional deaths are attributable to the stress and hardship of evacuating over 100,000 people. But due to radiation? 1.
But even if it had been 1,000 it would be NOTHING compared with 4.6 million a year from coal/oil.
4164 2018-12-18 18:08:51 Had to get this oil change 
4165 2018-12-18 18:08:48 TY Senator Wyden, I use CBD Oil made from Hemp. Tried it for my Cholesterol, but it works for my BP instead. Dr's need to be able to make recommendations for patient use, and can't with it illegal, even my Vet can't for my dog, who has seizures.
4166 2018-12-18 18:08:35 I think I have an oil fetish..
4167 2018-12-18 18:08:33 Trudeau shelled out 50 million to the Winston churchill fund over twitter in a matter of 30 seconds, but anything to do with oil has a 3 month delay? Delay delay delay
4168 2018-12-18 18:08:27 Οι γυναίκες να παλέψουν για ένα καλύτερο αύριο. Εμείς ας αρκεστούμε, ενώ παλεύουν, να τους πετάμε baby oil.
4169 2018-12-18 18:08:27 @jjhorgan  How insensitive can you get. Your asking oil workers to pay for climate change in BC after BC's pipeline policies have thrown countless oil workers out work.Many can not put bread on the table.Note I am not from BC or AB but Canada. - a country you do not support
4170 2018-12-18 18:08:26 How is he tied to those industries? Because individuals who work in the industry donated to him? You know what two of the biggest industries are in Texas? Oil and gas.
4171 2018-12-18 18:08:20 Cooking oil and foodstuffs
4172 2018-12-18 18:08:15 Just olive oil.
4173 2018-12-18 18:08:13 The entire palace from top to bottom will smell of feet, Marlboros and farts after we get through with it.
4174 2018-12-18 18:08:11 I haven't seen tulip fragrance, but I haven't really looked. There is a fragrance oil called "French fields" or something.
4175 2018-12-18 18:08:01 No matter the source, the take, the perspective, i submit that the syrian endgame is in the northeast where the oil is.
4176 2018-12-18 18:07:56 Hahahaha
4177 2018-12-18 18:07:55 Could even start a permanent fund for residents like Alaska does with oil revenues.
4178 2018-12-18 18:07:48 A future where poverty is at the barest minimum, health care and education are free and businesses asides crude oil are the anchors of the economy
4179 2018-12-18 18:07:46 1000 protesters for oil and covered like the second coming, plus immediate action. Millions march against climate change as our planet burns; next to no coverage, lots of hand-sitting. How about billions for renewable energy jobs and infrastructure? Canadian Green New Deal?
4180 2018-12-18 18:07:44 Reality doesn't care abt oil cartel propaganda. Problem is we all die if enough idiots believe the latter.
4181 2018-12-18 18:07:31 Maybe it's who you saw him playing with because skating isn't Zykov's thing.
4182 2018-12-18 18:07:27 Steal it from  Canada by way of its oil imports?
4183 2018-12-18 18:07:27 Eh ada jojeba oil
4184 2018-12-18 18:07:22 It won’t help one iota to put commercial loaned funds in the hands of oil/gas companies to try to find new markets outside of the United States. We still can’t get the product to tide water to export it. What country will sign on to buy something they cannot immediately access.
4185 2018-12-18 18:07:16 @jacksoncrompton How insensitive can you get. Your asking oil workers to pay for climate change in BC after BC's pipeline policies have thrown countless oil workers out work.Many can not put bread on the table.Note I am not from BC or AB but Canada. - a country you do not support
4186 2018-12-18 18:06:49 Bring your own toxic masculinity #BYOTM
4187 2018-12-18 18:06:46 Lillian Jr. cost too much money for an oil change.
4188 2018-12-18 18:06:39 I dated Summer’s mother way back in the day. She always smelled so good...like patchouli oil.
4189 2018-12-18 18:06:38 cooking oil is everywhere and anywhere mari yako chete
4190 2018-12-18 18:06:36 Dear Santa, gimme 5 barrels of pure CBD oil for Christmas.
Sincerely, Light Up Luke
4191 2018-12-18 18:06:33 Greedy oil companies always ruin it for everyone else. And then everything breaks and you know it’s out of spite.
4192 2018-12-18 18:06:29 I rolled my eyes every time I saw that "whoever's daughter needs to be reminded to go get your oil changed" post, but here I am 2000 miles over due for an oil change 
4193 2018-12-18 18:06:29 Can’t wait to the Gammon go to there local Holfords for a new oil filter “ sorry sir not in stock can order one  it will be in about 3 Weeks time ok “
4194 2018-12-18 18:06:22 @TheView and our oil is sold at 15$ vs. Over 40$/barrel everywhere else! Ridiculous how we are treated vs. others that kill people openly!
4195 2018-12-18 18:06:11 Me (at 19 years old in 1998): DAD! Oh my god I’m freeeeezing! How can you set the thermostat at 60 degrees?!

Me (at 39 years old in 2018): 60 ldegrees eats up a lot of oil, fast. Oil is expensive. Maybe, if I add one more layer of socks & a hoodie, I can get away w/58 degrees?
4196 2018-12-18 18:06:00 A sat rubbing mines wi oil for fuckin ages, thought a wis blind efter it like but still hud aw ma lashes so its all good

4198 2018-12-18 18:05:51 Were the auto and finance bailouts in 09 a trick hand out too? The world is changing, and oil is no longer booming. 

Not everything is the fault of a Liberal Government.
4199 2018-12-18 18:05:49 All #BTFD works here  $DDM , $LABD etc,..but freaking #oil .I'll burn 1000's  $barrels per day
4200 2018-12-18 18:05:46 Keep believing that my friend. Hope you get more followers soon. PS you'll miss our oil and export revenues, but I hear you do a good line in jam down south,that'll keep your economy going when the banks leave #DissolveTheUnion
4201 2018-12-18 18:05:45 1. He’s taken no campaign contributions from any PAC. Oil and gas doesn’t like him bc he backed the gas tax in Tx.  2. m4a is a video file format ??? 3. What exactly does ‘cozy up’ mean? We are a global economy after all 4. Ted Cruz is only unpopular outside of Tx.
4202 2018-12-18 18:05:34 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg  top Tory Snake Oil Salesman 
4203 2018-12-18 18:05:34 CBD oil and the gummies have been a game changer for sure. I’m so ready to just get off all meds even tho I only take two. That’s two too many to me.
4204 2018-12-18 18:05:30 So this guy blames democrats for the crime wave in the 70s-80s (dumb) and for the economic crisis of the mid 70s (a result largely of the Nixon shocks and the oil crisis) and for their ‘overreach’? This is the conservative narrative that leaves out white backlash to the VRA/CRA
4205 2018-12-18 18:05:24 I go to get my oil changed at @Valvoline and they immediately break my dipstick off. Oil change going v well so far
4206 2018-12-18 18:05:23 Ya. 
Stop letting Liberal cities dump sewage in our lakes and rivers. 
.
Pretend it's a plastic straw. 
Pretend it's oil.
Pretend its Harper's fault.
.
Just stop it.

K-thanks-bye.
4207 2018-12-18 18:05:16 I normally only have a little appointment anxiety, the usual worries about being late, showing up to the wrong office, etc. but I get insane anxiety every time I take my car for an oil change and I don’t even know WHY
4208 2018-12-18 18:05:10 Formal out-of-service oil tank inspections must be conducted when the tank is empty. Any sludge must be pumped out and the interior must be pressure washed or sand blasted to ensure the lower shell and floor plates can be thoroughly inspected.
4209 2018-12-18 18:05:07 Road trip- we each get to bring 1 undocumented person and they get to stay as permanent guests of the Speaker
4210 2018-12-18 18:05:04 No. The oil rigs r manned by indian labor.
4211 2018-12-18 18:05:02 Interesting article, it's a good POV, but I don't think we'll ever agree. I'm aware of the propaganda coming from my side, I don't believe everything I read about Alberta's oil. But you guys would have more credibility if you called out the propaganda coming from your side too.
4212 2018-12-18 18:04:55 I don't eat junk food, but the problem isn't MSG per se. The problem is that MSG confuses your taste buds. And all that stuff you get in Chinese food is *usually* fried in vegetable oil (which is garbage).
4213 2018-12-18 18:04:51 “Hey Vlad, great idea here! 
Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s supply and wreck our economy! 
Or we could just lie about it.  Their brainless MSM will believe anything.  ”
4214 2018-12-18 18:04:41 If you think that's bad, my mechanic charged me 20 Million Dollars to change my oil!? How is that allowed to happen?! I was so upset, I took by 500 thousand dollar Ford Pinto to another mechanic.
4215 2018-12-18 18:04:37 Guess what? The biggest threat to Canada is?! Also US and China trade war - we're impacted by the giants! PLUS our Oil with nowhere to go but south for deep discounts thanks to #Peoplekind  Canadians have had it with Dictator TruDope and are starting the #YellowVests protests.
4216 2018-12-18 18:04:36 but there are also those operate within there means with good quality acreage. Similar things were said with regards North Sea production in the 80s (that it would not be able to withstand low oil prices, yet production there did not peak until the earl 2000s.
4217 2018-12-18 18:04:34 Really? One of the knocks against the guy has always been his skating and my guess is that won't change. He is what he is.

4221 2018-12-18 18:04:20 Oil or gummy bears!!
4222 2018-12-18 18:04:19 this is why the paris agreement actually did NOT stop natural gas and oil use, bec ause they used this model of time as if we had time to keep polluting and to not make oil/gas liquidate and pay for their damage to our world.
4223 2018-12-18 18:04:17 #pipelines #gaz #oil @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley The establishment of Grand Trunk II between the east and west shores of Can. BC-TN seems the best solution: Trans-national Corridor where circulate: oil, electricity, gas, people & goods.
All Canadians would win. @OFF_TLMEP
4224 2018-12-18 18:04:11 I have super dry skin so my favs are Kiehls daily facial cream and Clinique facial lotion. Also the Mario budescu vitamin c oil before the lotion feels great in my skin.
4225 2018-12-18 18:04:09 I remember the day I swore off that dealership forever. Took my car in because the check engine light was on. They wanted to charge me for an engine flush costing more than $500. Sad I had sludge in the engine. Took it to Goodyear and all I needed was an oil change.
4226 2018-12-18 18:04:01 Seems like u had honey n olive oil mixed... Buddhi patwaran
4227 2018-12-18 18:03:59 I’m currently getting my 4th @JasperEngines in the last year. They keep leaking/burning oil. I’m happy they’ve remained committed to their warrantee, but had I known this going in, I would have purchased elsewhere to avoid the headache and frustration. #engine #4runner
4228 2018-12-18 18:03:52 “how’s your life going?”
WELLLLLLLLLL 
i checked my car this morning for the first time since my dad had last done it which was approximately a month & a half ago & ONLY bc he advised me to do so & it was low on brake fluid, low on motor oil & it didn’t have any anti freeze 
4229 2018-12-18 18:03:51 “I’m so fucking slick oil be jelly of me.”
4230 2018-12-18 18:03:51 I’m sure Nancy Pelosi would open up her North Beach mansion for us to hold an all genders welcome, non-themed, festivus gathering. With an open bar. @NancyPelosi
4231 2018-12-18 18:03:33 Why are diesel prices not falling with oil prices? Why is our government allowing the price gouging?
4232 2018-12-18 18:02:54 But palm oil!
4233 2018-12-18 18:02:53 When u want to talk about corruption under PMB those are the name always mentioned oga even the for oil minister beat them all .

4237 2018-12-18 18:02:34 I am a licenced supplier of the finest quality “full Spectrum” organic CBD oil in Europe - produced from the whole plant, not just the stalk. It complies with the EU laws in that there is less than 0.2% THC in the oil but this is crucial ingredient for optimum results
4238 2018-12-18 18:02:30 Monita gave me a mia maiason essential oil wtffff miniso lang naman ineexpect ko huhuhu
4239 2018-12-18 18:02:27 Nah I have seen some analyses done, Germany was doomed from the start. Hitler’s generals were also pushing for stupid ideas, Hitler for example wanted to get the Ukrainian oil fields whereas they did not.
4240 2018-12-18 18:02:19 My Chevy really screams at me when he’s running low on oil 
4241 2018-12-18 18:02:17 why do i even bother using body lotion when coconut oil is so effective AND smells so good?
4242 2018-12-18 18:02:16 He’s in Texas!    Of course he takes money from oil.   No way anyone from TX gets elected without it.  Just like Bernie taking $$ from the NRA.  Vermont is a gun state.    Beto takes no PAC money.  He’s transparent
4243 2018-12-18 18:02:13 oil getting hammered today again..$spy green.
4244 2018-12-18 18:02:07 Well, every business needs to turn a profit to remain viable. Simplified, our problems are created by pipeline bottlenecks due to opposition to approved projects, cheap shale oil flooding the market in the US and lack of international capital due to these uncertainties.
4245 2018-12-18 18:02:06 The way to flip the US is literally to flip it. Meld it. Unite it. By rebuilding from top to bottom without cars and oil and military at the center. Use principles of #cybercommunities to make populations much more uniform in terms of the areas. Figure it out.
4246 2018-12-18 18:02:05 อยากได้ 05 ค่าา
4247 2018-12-18 18:01:59 That's key rollover. Rolloer with API and after EIA with FED... yesterday i draw daily support level and said if broken there would be abyss. Now it is abyss no need sell it from bottom #oott #usoil #oil #crudeoil
4248 2018-12-18 18:01:55 so they don't go broke and hord their money they take from countries to stay rich instead of the richness of saving all of our lives.  This sickness of acting like we have years when our time is UP has got to stop. This was the creation of gas/oil companies using a time model.
4249 2018-12-18 18:01:51 Why not refine our own oil?

4257 2018-12-18 18:00:54 Sohi announces $1.6 Bilion dollars in loans to oil and gas industry to “expand into new markets”. That would mean building a pipeline to a coast. Any coast. Liberals have blocked all attempts to build a pipeline to a coast.
4258 2018-12-18 18:00:51 Yeah David, buy he got that awesome oil painting of himself! 
4259 2018-12-18 18:00:46 NO its NOT good enough, we dont' have the time to make sure that there is NOT a major shift in gas and oil making money, it needs to be banned and our countries provide green transportation as much as possible. WE are out of time folks, it is called stored carbon. they do this
4260 2018-12-18 18:00:43 I once got the following as a Christmas bonus
1. 2kg sugar 
2. 2kg rice
3. 2.5l cooking oil
4. One chicken
4261 2018-12-18 18:00:38 Some people believe that using synthetic motor oil will void the manufacturer's warranty, but you don't have to worry. You'll be fine as long the oil matches manufacturer's specifications, and many new cars actually come from the factory with synthetic oil.
4262 2018-12-18 18:00:36 Id try to oil. Ive nwvwr had cbd

4265 2018-12-18 18:00:26 This is about Canadian pipelines/oil industry. Why did CBC throw in that utterly false claim that the French protests are NOT about their carbon tax, but against "wealth inequality"?? Why suggest the French are demanding MORE socialism?? 
@ezralevant
4266 2018-12-18 18:00:25 my housemate saw the Iceland adverts and actually thought that palm oil came from monkeys’ palms
4267 2018-12-18 18:00:19 Mark, thank you for responding to the #TransMountainPipeline thing.
I'm so confused, they are ("WHO" the govt?) building a pipeline that's intended to ship oil overseas.
Not to the USA.
Who else?
Unless it's connecting to Russia who pay lower rates & already have oil?
4268 2018-12-18 18:00:19 To je za članove, Green Oil. Ja sipao benzin, rega gorivo
4269 2018-12-18 18:00:12 I guess the oil industry is dead
4270 2018-12-18 18:00:12 Right? He's SUCH a con man! It's sad that so many people are so gulliable. Any smart/sane person can smell his snake oil from a mile away.
4271 2018-12-18 18:00:08 Albertans and the oil industry have never asked for any welfare, they just want the Liberal government to quit deliberately destroying the industry, get out of the way and let legally approved pipelines be built
4272 2018-12-18 18:00:06 It's incredibly hard to accept that you've been duped. Once you buy the snake oil, you REALLY wanna believe what the barker said.
That's how the snake oil salesman thing works.
Half the townspeople tell the rubes
"don't buy it"

4279 2018-12-18 17:59:40 Of it cannot be replicated, then it is not Science. Psychology is not a Science, because it cannot be replicated. Some day it will be, maybe, but right now Psychology is pseudoscience and snake oil.
4280 2018-12-18 17:59:37 ...and have deregulated everything that protects "the people". Tax cuts, for who, the rich (like you). And a few coal, oil, jobs that are paying well to a handful of people. While Saudi Arabia bank rolls you, you are no different than all the others, milking the taxpayer money.

Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them.

4285 2018-12-18 17:59:13 Actual conversation I had this week with a 'young' family member: "hey, I figured out what that engine noise was. I got the oil changed and it went away..turns out it was low on oil, I was going to check it but forgot"
4286 2018-12-18 17:59:11 What do you think of IOCs and E&Ps with diverse global portfolios (XOM, CVX, COP, BP, etc.) who view US LTO as some of their most competitive assets in a low oil price environment, almost always beating out deepwater & other unconventional sources for investment dollars?
4287 2018-12-18 17:59:01 In my experience, cbd oil has helped reduce arthritis inflammation, Costochondritis inflammation and so, has reduced the pains those inflammations cause. 
It has not helped with the nerve pains or painful fibromyalgia cramps and yanking...yet..almost two weeks after first dose.
4288 2018-12-18 17:58:58 haah. one thing i do i sapu dgn cream lipstick, wipe with tisu, then guna oil cleanser & face wash. Micellar water tak boleh
4289 2018-12-18 17:58:57 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
4290 2018-12-18 17:58:50 Liberals are like the guy who takes you to dinner and sticks you with the bill. @JustinTrudeau deliberately destroys oil industry, borrows $1.6b to give to industry and sticks Alberta with the repayment #abexit #westexit

4303 2018-12-18 17:57:47 I have zero ties to OIL & Gas industry but I’m smart enough to know that world consumption is increasing & our country with immense employment in this resource is missing out.  Over 100,000 Albertans have lost jobs while Trudeau keeps our resources in ground

4305 2018-12-18 17:57:22 Long term I expect new ATH’s in oil. There’s some bugs that go beyond oil markets that may need to be worked out in 2019. Lots of global risk short term and not saying there’s isn’t a bounce sometime soon

4312 2018-12-18 17:56:32 The oil and gas sector does not need nor want subsidies
They need access to markets 
They don't need government intervention 
They need government to GET OUT OF THE WAY
4313 2018-12-18 17:56:21 Need a oil change now im annoyed fr all this money being spent right before Christmas
4314 2018-12-18 17:56:21 Start by not using anything oil. Let me know how you do.
4315 2018-12-18 17:56:16 I get paid tomorrow and it’s going straight into ah oil change
4316 2018-12-18 17:56:14 Alternatively how about just pushing to stop importing, AND using oil at all? We don't need oil anymore, the technology is basically there for electric "everything", just not the (political) will for change.
4317 2018-12-18 17:56:13 It feels so good to finally get an oil change 
4318 2018-12-18 17:56:04 I use it hemp oil to remove my makeup
4319 2018-12-18 17:56:03 Where is the cheaper hydro . And the low gas prices are due to a record low oil prices ... Not Ford
4320 2018-12-18 17:55:57 Just shows how out of touch you are with the issue.  Coming from a province that has an Oil and Gas Industry (Be it a small one) I’m surprised by your comments.  This effects Manitoba royalties as well.
4321 2018-12-18 17:55:51 All the housing, medical, essentials, clothing, and food shall be provided by those that created this migration crisis and the wars. GAS and oil companies.

4323 2018-12-18 17:55:45 So the idea of a managed no deal is a myth then? Next you'll be telling me the Pope is a Catholic. Why this government spends its time trying to trade snake oil for wolf tickets is beyond me #BrexitShambles
4324 2018-12-18 17:55:42 "don't forget the bottle of gun oil in your EDC!"
4325 2018-12-18 17:55:39 If you got synthetic oil you good ladies lol
4326 2018-12-18 17:55:38 Dont see how funds aren't blowing up, this oil drop is crazy!
4327 2018-12-18 17:55:36 Them no sabi say u na crocodile
4328 2018-12-18 17:55:22 Donkey.  You must have good rubber shoes and no appliances at home. You haven’t a clue how much oil you use in a day.
4329 2018-12-18 17:55:15 So in that Dawn commercial where they save a duck from an oil spill... did they cover a duck in oil to get a shot?
4330 2018-12-18 17:54:55 HOW TO CONTINUED
- 3rd, roll vertically and then horizontally
- 4th, reapply the serum/oil you choose
- 5th, clean your roller with more alcohol
4331 2018-12-18 17:54:53 Automation is already being implemented in the oil sands, has been for years.
4332 2018-12-18 17:54:48 Proven that the Trump’s used their ‘charity foundation’ to con people out of money and pocket it for themselves.

And ALL Trumps are now BANNED from being involved any charities in NY state.

Con artists. Grifters. Snake oil merchants. PROVEN LIARS.
4333 2018-12-18 17:54:39 If you notice 500m is diversification fund. Trudeau planned this. It’s part of his phasing out oil. He knew there will be a lot of pain. So he throws EI and money. Essentially screwing taxpayers every time while following his plan on killing the energy industry.
4334 2018-12-18 17:54:37 Chicken oil na nga lang masarap sa mang insal , tapos wala pa hahahah kapanot
4335 2018-12-18 17:54:34 How badly am I going to lose this trade to get Parayko to Edmonton?
4336 2018-12-18 17:54:33 Ed - this bailout means the feds have dropped about $6 billion into the oil and gas industry when they had a private company ready to build a pipeline.  Albertans don’t want bailouts or federal charity.  We want policies that makes sense for all of Canada so we can all make money
4337 2018-12-18 17:54:26 This oil change is long over due. Idk how my car didn’t die on me 
4338 2018-12-18 17:54:24 sc30 ฮ่ะะะ
4339 2018-12-18 17:54:23 But these aren’t things you have to buy every month - seasoning, foil, kitchen roll, oil, etc. Vegetables are £1 frozen from Iceland and Asda. 2L water is 17p a bottle. A water filter will even make that free.
4340 2018-12-18 17:54:22 It’s upsetting. Eastern Canada preachs bout Human Rights & Environment yet use incoming Tanker Oil from countries with much worse Enviro Standards & Disgusting Human Rights. 
USA is laughing at They’re Alberta’s only Oil export at 1/3 off & sell to Ont & Que @ full market price
4341 2018-12-18 17:54:04 There's no palm oil in UK products!!?? Wow!
4342 2018-12-18 17:54:03 And why is the oil industry in such a predicament? Did you seriously expect to rake in the money constantly forever? What exactly do you want?
4343 2018-12-18 17:54:03 White rice with palm oil stew
4344 2018-12-18 17:53:58 #Oil (WTI) trading at $47.48.
4345 2018-12-18 17:53:53 Just got my oil changed for free and getting my car fixed next week for nothin. I’m about to get this man a Christmas gift
4346 2018-12-18 17:53:53 I’m still shook at how this technician broke my car key because I didn’t want to get any other service he was selling besides an oil change man oh man..
4347 2018-12-18 17:53:52 And fuel, Diesel's engine originally ran on peanut oil.
4348 2018-12-18 17:53:40 How can you say that? Isn't the state benifiting from the sale of the oil? Why is Venezuela failing so miserably? The capitalists have not run that country for many years. What has gone wrong?
4349 2018-12-18 17:53:35 Get the oil to market and they won’t need a taxpayer handout
4350 2018-12-18 17:53:25 Quietly enter the mosque, pick a copy of the Qur'an and read, some might even be doing their own prayer in their room but the noise from your speakers are interrupting them. We are Muslims and civilised, we shouldn't put everything on speaker because we see others doing it.
4351 2018-12-18 17:53:12 Wow.  The thing is JT is putting up road blocks of Alberta Oil sand exporting (inter provincial and world) and yet Canada imports from repressive regimes. So the Western Canada is calling him a hypocrite.  Its a mess.
4352 2018-12-18 17:53:12 I wonder if Saudi Arabia and Iran will also shut down their oil production in solidarity with Canada. 
4353 2018-12-18 17:53:08 I dont understand Americans that advocate for allowing almost 2 million people per year to migrate into a post industrial economy that creates less than 2 million jobs per yr net.
4354 2018-12-18 17:52:59 Damn! Too much oil 
4355 2018-12-18 17:52:59 Completely opposite... we are expecting to earn more from non oil industries ... and we succeeded so far .. our income from non oil sector increased by 20% from last year... in 2019 it’s going to be more
4356 2018-12-18 17:52:59 independente disso vamos ver a rentabilidade dessas empresas de shale nos EUA com o Oil nesse preço..
4357 2018-12-18 17:52:56 Good luck with that. Taking advice from a guy who was shorting gold at the lows. Very likely the same about to unfold here with oil.
4358 2018-12-18 17:52:55 In $UWT at 10.73.  Make Oil Great Again!
4359 2018-12-18 17:52:54 What will they do without our water whisky agriculture oil fishing banking and where ty F### will they base Trident
4360 2018-12-18 17:52:54 @FordService_UK hi, I’ve just had to fork out £70 for an oil change on my BRAND NEW Ford Focus after ONLY 4K miles!! What’s going on here then? Surely this isn’t normal? No other Focus I’ve ever had has needed an oil change at 4K miles  who do I talk to for reimbursement?
4361 2018-12-18 17:52:53 Recommend you call the International Church of Las Vegas and ask them to send someone to anoint him with oil and pray for him.James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
4362 2018-12-18 17:52:52 Agree long term but if equities bounce here oil could too.  Short term corrective play only.
4363 2018-12-18 17:52:50 CBD oil
4364 2018-12-18 17:52:44 He got donations from people employed in the oil and pharmaceutical industries, not corporate donations. They need to read more carefully.
4365 2018-12-18 17:52:41 Berners are already trying to demolish him as a corporatist for oil & gas industry.
There is no reasoning with them.
On the bright side, that poll out of Iowa, shows a significant loss of support for BS. Some to Biden, some to Warren, according to one analysis I saw.
4366 2018-12-18 17:52:34 So is this a way of revealing you do already have a secret space program as many have said for years or you're about to roll out new tech to drag humanity off Oil and into the solar system properly?
4367 2018-12-18 17:52:32 HOW TO
- 1st, your needle should be sterilized with alcohol
- 2nd, apply whatever serum/oil of your choosing
- 3rd, apply light pressure with the roller across all areas of your face you want to treat. It shouldn’t hurt it your doing it at home with the right size needle
4368 2018-12-18 17:52:28 I get it, but pakuzo shanda vese apo. Mvura ne oil hazvisangane lol
4369 2018-12-18 17:52:10 You know I’ve actually come to appreciate these.  Not all olive oil is created equally-some are super pungent, others soft and mellow. It’s nice to see what you’re getting and choose accordingly before you spend an arm and a leg on it. $30+ is a lot to spend on evoo you hate.
4370 2018-12-18 17:52:09 All electric vehicles need charging. The electricity needed comes from oil/coal fired /nuclear power plants. These will have to work longer and harder and thus pollute more to meet the needs of charging electric vehicles. I haven't heard much discussion on this aspect.
4371 2018-12-18 17:52:06 Ну блять с наступающим
4372 2018-12-18 17:52:03 I'm waiting for tax break for whale oil fueled cars before I buy my next vehicle
4373 2018-12-18 17:51:51 I'm sure some of the products that you eat contain palm oil, too, skippy.
4374 2018-12-18 17:51:30 uh yeah if a democratic candidate takes money from weapons manufacturers like Raytheon or from big oil, they should absolutely be challenged.
4375 2018-12-18 17:51:26 Thank you! Yes. it's definitely scary, but I have been very conservative in my approach. I sell CBD oil and CBD-infused products. I started using CBD to help with anxiety, couldn't believe the improvement; for pain, too. I don't make it. Reseller.
4376 2018-12-18 17:51:23 $1.5B of $1.6B is re-payable loans.  Why would OIL & Gas take loans when they can’t get product to market?   This is just smoke & mirrors Don.
4377 2018-12-18 17:51:20 I sent a history book to Zuck, on how Standard Oil was broken up by trust busters in the early 1900s. He, like most of SV, has ZERO knowledge of history and thinks he will be able to one up everyone. He is very wrong and the entire tech industry has primed him as the fall guy.
4378 2018-12-18 17:51:16 Not too many teams can back Jose or would want to. Places he can go are limited. Oil money with short term plans.
4379 2018-12-18 17:51:08 As I understand it, we need to move toward sustainable palm oil, as removing it all together will mean lower yielding crops requiring more land, but Iceland is just 1 supermarket in 1 country replacing it, when thousands of others do nothing ~ that can't be a bad thing can it ??
4380 2018-12-18 17:51:05 Economic jitters and surging supplies from the U.S. to Moscow dragged oil prices to the lowest level in 15 months - Bloomberg
4381 2018-12-18 17:50:58 Guess you don’t know much about palm oil then 
4382 2018-12-18 17:50:56 so is there any way they could increase their revenue by manipulating the type of crude oil they produce as opposed to where its being sold to?
4383 2018-12-18 17:50:48 I don't need random allergens. So many soaps have almond oil and lavender, even when not listed as something they would have ("Fragrance" is a nice catch-all to get a fun allergy burn). I like that I know what these soaps are and can avoid any that would hurt my family or me.
4384 2018-12-18 17:50:45 2/2 ...but I no longer feel that (whether it's speaking to large groups, in interviews, or even just with family and friends. We've also used a CBD Oil product for our dog - as recommended by our Vet. We give it to him about 20min prior to any large storm. Calms him quite well.
4385 2018-12-18 17:50:40 He actually didn't take a single PAC/corporate donation - all his money is from employees in the oil industry. TX has a really big oil and gas industry and employs tens of thousands of people. Agree that beto has faults, but taking PAC money is NOT one of them!
4386 2018-12-18 17:50:37 Incredibly unsurprising. Big oil wins, at what cost to humanity?! So short sighted $
4387 2018-12-18 17:50:33 The judge opened his mouth in disbelief, but truth be told, after calling the first fajr prayer, then the boys maintening the mosque go ahead to play qiraa on speaker till it's time for the actual prayer.
Let's be honest, that's wrong. If you want to supplicate, do so by yourself
4388 2018-12-18 17:50:16 UPDATE | 6400 Blk S. Eastern | This fire has been extinguished.  This was a piece of oil field equipment being dismantled when it caught fire.  There were no injuries reported.  All companies returning to service shortly. DM 11:50 a.m.
4389 2018-12-18 17:50:12 Only until we threaten to leave with our oil, gas, fishing, farming, whisky, gin, fresh water & electricity resources. All of a sudden its "oh please don't leave, we love you!"
Why do some Scottish people continue to tolerate this utter contempt!
Time to leave this toxic union!
4390 2018-12-18 17:50:05 17 American oil and gas companies reported a total of $25 billion in one-time benefits from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Tax Act then reduced all corporate annual tax bills by a minimum of 40 percent every year. I'm wondering why they needed it in the first place lol
4391 2018-12-18 17:50:02 The jamaican castor oil one
4392 2018-12-18 17:50:02 American shale producers are waiting with a bone saw and a barrel of acid for 2019 oil prices to walk in the door
4393 2018-12-18 17:50:02 I would like to see Scotland attain energy/economic independence without oil, as the lifespan of that revenue/market is dying, and our future lies with renewables and greener energy. I believe we can succeed alone,  doing it ecologically and economically
4394 2018-12-18 17:49:57 anybody else getting day drunk bc they're at hm cooking & cleaning while their car is being repaired for a recall & oil changed?
4395 2018-12-18 17:49:54 oil painting is fun for like a certain amount of time and then it just. gets tiring and gives me anxiety aaahahahaha
4396 2018-12-18 17:49:51 *pours coconut oil over entire life*
4397 2018-12-18 17:49:50 Bribing Albertans with our own money. We want a pipeline not a handout. Trudeau, under the constitution can make this happen - that’s how the railway was built. He does not want to. He hates Oil & hates the West more.
4398 2018-12-18 17:49:45 86 dollars for the oil change like what I’m pushing a civic lmao
4399 2018-12-18 17:49:45 Can y’all nigga keep it professional like please don’t shoot your shot if I’m asking about my oil change.
4400 2018-12-18 17:49:30 You can say all you want but the fact is Alberta must build pipelines to export their oil and gas for the citizens of Canada!
4401 2018-12-18 17:49:28 You mean China. Taiwan is buying up all the oil China was.
4402 2018-12-18 17:49:28 @SeamusORegan $1.6B for the oil patch? They don’t need a handout, they need a pipeline. Fix the problem. Don’t throw a bandaid on it.
4403 2018-12-18 17:49:26 my dad made me actually go with him to get my oil changed for my car please tell me I'm living in a fucking simulation
4404 2018-12-18 17:49:21 BUY #Oil & HODL 
4405 2018-12-18 17:49:19 Hmmm yes let’s figure out why we don’t get world prices for the oil we send to our only customer.

4407 2018-12-18 17:49:08 Nie znam sie na energii, ale czy to nie jest tak, że to wzrost kosztów energii _musi_ przełożyć się na wzrost cen dla odbiorców końcowych, bez względu na to ile sie właduje dotacji? Czy nie tak było przypadkiem z oil shocks?
4408 2018-12-18 17:49:02 Wow! Oil prices now as low as they were 3 years ago. Then petrol was 104p/litre. Pump prices still need to reduce by another 10p at least!
4409 2018-12-18 17:48:52 Remains to be seen whether they follow up by cancelling oil exploration licences within their offshore waters. A step in right direction
4410 2018-12-18 17:48:50 We must buy those big litre oil tubs defo don’t need to buy oil or seasoning every month
4411 2018-12-18 17:48:49 The oil price is falling down like Kremlin Potemkin regime!
4412 2018-12-18 17:48:45 Don't worry about it. The bulk of the money, 1 billion+ is for "loans" to #abpoli Oil and Gas to diversify into "green energy". Not kidding. Hope there's lots of wind and sun.
4413 2018-12-18 17:48:42 Oil down >5% today? Time to re-read Jesse's warnings about junk bond underpinning of US shale oil
4414 2018-12-18 17:48:37 Let me guess. It was good farming, had water oil gold or some other asset.
4415 2018-12-18 17:48:29 @jkenney 

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCCESS DID NOT INCLUDE: oil tankers. The earth quake or impacts to life with the two collide. 

YOU WANT TO KILL EVERYONE and are ignorant! 

@UNEnvironment @liberal_party @NDP @CanadianGreens
4416 2018-12-18 17:48:27 Ah So you people are not showing pictures of “Christmas OIL & RICE” on my timelines. Why? 

All cool?
4417 2018-12-18 17:48:21 #trade Canada to Offer $1.1 Billion in Loan Support for Oil Sector

It includes “commercial financial support” loans of C$1 billion from Export Development Canada, and C$500 million in commercial financing from the Business Development Bank of Canada. The EDC money will be a…
4418 2018-12-18 17:48:21 How are they going to move the oil companies and take the oil at the same time?  GM bailout was a terrible idea...should have let them fail
4419 2018-12-18 17:48:19 Oil prices sank to another one-year low with the market soured by signs of plentiful American supplies
4420 2018-12-18 17:48:10 Bullshit! Unbelievablely stupid tweet! This hobbling if the oil and gas industry by the Liberals and NDP has hurt people across the board across Canada. Basic economics. Less personal income leads to depressed economy.
4421 2018-12-18 17:48:08 From NP  Between January and June of this year that refinery has imported $1.8 billion of Saudi oil" varies depending on oil price but yes we do all to Irving refinery in NB

4423 2018-12-18 17:47:50 One time in my area, a man was served a court sermon, when he got to the court, the judge who was also a muslim read his offence to him that the mosque in his house is constituting noise pollution, then went ahead to look at the name of the plaintiff, behold, it was a HAJIYA.
4424 2018-12-18 17:47:47 Cut sugar completely. Little salt only. No sweets. No ghee. No junk food. Nothing oily  Dinner - oil less chappathy. Lunch - little of rice, Lots of vegetable (any, except potato). Snack-lots of fruits (except banana). Do this for a month, for sure you l reduce.
4425 2018-12-18 17:47:45 People who suggest 'eat all day' to gain weight are giving bad advice. Stuffing yourself when you're not hungry can lead to IBS or ruin your digestive system. Instead eat high fats. Peanut butter, grass-fed butter, avocados, drink spoons of olive oil, eat nuts, duck, porridge.
4426 2018-12-18 17:47:40 does castor oil actually help?
4427 2018-12-18 17:47:39 it truly does suck. thanks friend!  it was a good reminder to be grateful for the warm place to sleep I normally do have, but also a reminder that our oil company sucks and needs to be more on top of this so they don't kill people (and hedgehogs that need to stay warm).
4428 2018-12-18 17:47:25 Airlines were mostly higher, IAG jumped 11p to 608p on weaker crude oil prices
4429 2018-12-18 17:47:20 Ain't nothing wrong with cooking them in olive oil and some minced garlic
4430 2018-12-18 17:47:02 Thanks for the correction I was not aware they had stopped importing Saudi oil.

Aku baru manjangin rambut lagi (biasanya pendek bondol) dan krn kebiasaan pendek jd jarang ngerawat rambut. Waktu rambut panjang gini malah kering dan rusak pengen coba loreal extra oilnya itu sih hehehe, wish me luck
4433 2018-12-18 17:46:43 Those people who don't believe in the powers of olive oil and cheese should examine the fact that a man with my lifestyle is still alive
4434 2018-12-18 17:46:35 The souring global sentiment weighed on London. UK blue chips fell 71 points near the close dragged lower by weak oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell B fell 57p after unveiling plans to spend US$8bn on buying Endeavour Energy

4436 2018-12-18 17:46:33 Yes because by building a pipeline other customers will want to pay more for Alberta’s oil, not market rate mind you, just a bit more than what you get now.  Oh wait, no they won’t it costs more to refine your oil...
4437 2018-12-18 17:46:29 Have you tried CBD oil? Man this stuff has changed my life.....FOR THE BETTER! Best choice I've made in years!
4438 2018-12-18 17:46:04 Vegetable oil €1 and it’ll last you like a month. There’s a whole pasta meal that’s used to last me like 5 days to a week or maybe even longer and that’s under €10 spent
4439 2018-12-18 17:45:55 Why not? Fractional reserve banking works in keep gold down? Why not keep oil up? They should sell puts too
4440 2018-12-18 17:45:37 I do not know....Maybe Trump wants lower oil prices (he did tweet about that)...Maybe he realizes the Chinese will buy Iranian oil anyway and better to show a friendly gesture...

4447 2018-12-18 17:45:08 People hate Man Utd fans because you make arrogant statements like in the one above. As for scrutiny, all the top teams do: Spurs ridiculed for finishing 3rd in a 2-horse race, Arsenal being Arsenal, Chelsea for being a bunch of racists, Man City for oil money.

4453 2018-12-18 17:44:46 There are no pipeline protests in Texas or North Dakota.  This was never about the environment.  It's always been about the money.  US interests are paying for the protests ONLY in Canada. They want to keep buying oil at a discount because Canada can't reach world market.

4455 2018-12-18 17:44:40 My dad pretty much had all boys, I was such a little tomboy. Like I’d help my dad change our tires, change oil. It was a him and I thing picking his fantasy hockey team. Growing up I asked for gloves, sticks, hats and workout stuff.  #ilovemydad
4456 2018-12-18 17:44:36 Feminists have oversold this Patriarchy snake oil. It's past its selling date. None outside your echo chambers buy your snake oil. Come out of delusion and live a normal life, errrrr.., patriarchial life..
4457 2018-12-18 17:44:23 I’ve called Pep Boys twice for an oil change and both times, I got a snotty answer. WELL LAZY FUCKS, I’m bringing my car in and you’re gonna fuckin’ like it.
4458 2018-12-18 17:44:17 'The only way is down': Oil's slump could get much worse amid oversupply concerns, analysts say.
4459 2018-12-18 17:43:59 Had the same thought too yesterday. Buy I did go for a ride earlier today from Kepong>Sg Buloh >masuk NKVE>Airport Subang>Subang>PJ>home. Kebas bontot lol. Nak genapkan mileage motor for next oil change/service.

4461 2018-12-18 17:43:28 Oil will go to zero in 2019 and everyone will still pay the $25-60 it costs to fill car/Truck @ pump.
4462 2018-12-18 17:43:26 Finally, bought cosmoderm’s vitamin e with rosehip oil moisturiser! I hope it works well with my skin 
4463 2018-12-18 17:43:25 You're exactly right. Big oil is the EXACT reason.
4464 2018-12-18 17:43:05 analysts cannot really predict the way stocks react to changing oil prices.
4465 2018-12-18 17:42:58 Actually, Obama did revive the US Oil Boom. During his first term he said that the US was going to stop relying on foreign oil. “I’m not a Republican, Democrat or Independent. I just call it as I see it.” The real truth over a easy lie.
4466 2018-12-18 17:42:54 Doesn’t make a lot of sense to bring unregulated oil into Canada when we can produce our own!
4467 2018-12-18 17:42:37 Never had that but checkers always make meThrow up cuz of the oil
4468 2018-12-18 17:42:36 What makes Red Dead Redemption 2 one of the greatest game of all time is, you get to blow up an entire village to cover up a robbing a oil wagon!
4469 2018-12-18 17:42:31 there is little correlation between oil prices and the stock market.

4476 2018-12-18 17:41:45 Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has worked as a lobbyist for oil and gas companies including Halliburton, and is likely to continue Zinke's agenda of errors and obvious ethical missteps.
4477 2018-12-18 17:41:41 Gen. Butler wrote that book upon reflecting on his own military career and realized how he was used.
Syria, Ukraine, Iraq all these wars are about energy. US fomented coup in Kiev bcz wanted oil and gas in Black sea.  Hunter Biden sits on an energy board based in Kiev.
4478 2018-12-18 17:41:36 Scotland supplies 12% of England electricity so they could sell that and recover many billions. They also have the capability to capture and store freshwater (always rains) for export which is worth more than oil. Plus they still have the oil... whisky exports could increase too.
4479 2018-12-18 17:41:32 Delete them. Pray for them and give them some holy oil (and cocoa butter)!
4480 2018-12-18 17:41:31 ppl who argue their pro-pipeline, oil, etc. with me always try to explain how it's a necessary evil, until we "transition" to a clean economy...

but in the absence of any hard transitional plan, their point falls flat.

4482 2018-12-18 17:41:24 Lol sad how you let yourself be used by the corporate democratic establishment. Don’t be mad people see the dems for what they really are - which is mostly pro war, pro wall street, pro oil.This Russia paranoia is childish and insulting and erases the real reasons ppl hate dems.

4487 2018-12-18 17:40:54 Wasn't Permian the area with many planned pipelines to be finished in 2019 (in order to flood the market with even more oil)? Not a bright future for the shale-industrie.
4488 2018-12-18 17:40:51 Don't care what this money is for. @OilGasCanada got a pipeline for mega bucks and now @liberal_party is forking out more of our money? What about seniors? Disabled citizens? Or the homeless? It's like gov in in the laps of the oil and gas industry.
4489 2018-12-18 17:40:50 Dr Hansen, Dr Evil to you promotes nuclear.  It's the oil lobby putting barriers on nuclear bcos it will hurt their profits $$$.

4493 2018-12-18 17:40:30 So 44 years on since they first discovered that cannabis oil was apoptotic and angiogenetic they are still at the stage where there’s not been enough research done for it to be used as a cancer treatment. GW are just at the clinical trial phase for treating gliomas.

4500 2018-12-18 17:39:56 so, from where is quebec buying OIL ???
4501 2018-12-18 17:39:54 I thought these morons were here to support the oil workers not make comments on climate change and support stupid Quebec dairy. They continue to make asses of themselves.
4502 2018-12-18 17:39:54 In light of the announcement of more $'s expected, in part to create  new markets for Canadian Oil, can someone tell me who can process Alberta bitumen other than Canada and the US?
4503 2018-12-18 17:39:54 Oil is fungible so in the medium term it has no effect. Others will buy US oil.
4504 2018-12-18 17:39:46 BLACK OIL FRIDAY
4505 2018-12-18 17:39:34 And you can tell from the smear that they were trying to rub if off. They thought oil comes off like cornflakes
4506 2018-12-18 17:39:27 @HalftimeReport @jonnajarian I wish someone would say something about how the normal American is benefiting from lower oil in ways that nobody on that desk understands or cares to bring up. I want oil at $10 a barrel. Why not
4507 2018-12-18 17:39:21 Oil in free fall..$47
4508 2018-12-18 17:39:16 The FED will raise....They have already committed to doing so...Oil has reacted to other things. Mainly to a panic over US shale. People must be thinking it will grow forever and want it to stop via severely lowering prices.

Then I add vitamic c serum. Moisturize w/ Aveeno night cream mixed with pure vitamin e if my skin feels dry
4513 2018-12-18 17:38:42 Invest in resources!

Those who control the natural resources hold the keys to controlling the universe.

4521 2018-12-18 17:38:02 So when will all the oil be gone. Will you hold your breath until then? Will u stop tweeting 100Watts per tweet? The earth is for Humanity. We must b responsible stewards we can balance our needs and those necessary to maintain ecological prosperity. Are tree's keystone species?
4522 2018-12-18 17:37:50 I got a gramophone that u have to wind up by hand, old thick vinyls from my grandfather and the box of nails and oil to play it still lol
4523 2018-12-18 17:37:50 So the quicker the paper market has crashed oil the longer it will take to rise?  How does that makes sense?
4524 2018-12-18 17:37:36 We are bottoming over the next quarter or two. Severe under-investment will lead to a new oil bull market over the next 5 years.
4525 2018-12-18 17:37:30 what? um.. idk what to say but apparently, castor oil. xx
4526 2018-12-18 17:37:28 Talk about throwing shade to pretty much everyone on the planet.  Simple fact the world requires oil.  Everything in your life is because if oil.  Your cloths, food, materials your home is made from, and yes even your electric car.
4527 2018-12-18 17:37:25 $OIL will keep crashing... Oversupply. Will hurt in 2019
4528 2018-12-18 17:37:24 And China leads the growth of more fossil fuel use with growing coal and oil consumption.

4533 2018-12-18 17:37:08 I agree that the Oil are in tough right now. They have to take as many points as possible while they're waiting for the blue line to get healthy. If Hitch has a plan to do just that, great.
4534 2018-12-18 17:37:01 There is a reason so many are used as Taxis  because they are built like tanks and the Engine ( as long as regular oil change) are bulletproof enjoy
4535 2018-12-18 17:36:57 No, they didn't. Once they started drilling for their own oil, competitors undercut their prices and that's WHY they did not remain a monopoly.

You really don't know very much about their history, it seems.
4536 2018-12-18 17:36:55 Judge certainly thinks otherwise. You clowns just sully your past good work. Getting uglier by the minute for snake oil salesmen and just plain snakes.
4537 2018-12-18 17:36:42 When congress left the ruling then the price of crude oil was approx $120/barrel and petrol price was approx ₹70/litre, now crude oil price is $60/barrel and petrol price is approx ₹80/litre. Every country has decreased the fuel price but India has not. Just think once.
4538 2018-12-18 17:36:37 Perhaps you could tell me how many people live in the Yukon in January. Because I’m going to guess it’s not a whole lot. Perhaps if Alberta starts focusing on green energy they can diversify their economy and not be so dependant on oil.
4539 2018-12-18 17:36:33 She used 50 litres of oil on her legs before JUMPING in it!

4542 2018-12-18 17:36:29 And oil companies are still some of the most profitable, and certainly don't need this form of corporate welfare.
4543 2018-12-18 17:36:26 I bought more oil stock today! I’m ready for a rally.
4544 2018-12-18 17:36:13 how did tumblr's algorithms delete a painting that included nipples and yet manage to fully leave up the oil painting i did of a cumshot last spring
4545 2018-12-18 17:36:10 Some of the money is related to Natural Resources Canada’s "clean growth" program for oil and gas projects. But most is connected with financing to help fossil fuel firms export their products and deal with market uncertainty.
4546 2018-12-18 17:36:07 Crude Oil Prices Risk Deeper Losses After Support Break: Crude oil prices plunged amid a market-wide slump in risk appetite, breaking below key support and opening the door for deeper losses to follow.
4547 2018-12-18 17:35:59 It wasn't a "natural" monopoly.

There was nothing "natural" about Standard Oil's monopoly at all.

They simply bought others out and attempted to bar others from entering the business.

In fact it was the OPPOSITE of a "natural" monopoly, because oil is all over the place.
4548 2018-12-18 17:35:58 Published on December 18, 2018 at 12:23. Ottawa contributes $ 1.6 billion to the oil and gas sector. Surely there are a few of my taxes in there.
4549 2018-12-18 17:35:56 Oil baixo não estimula forte crescimento mundial? 

Mas caiu 40% em 2 meses e vamos pra recessão? Não entendo mais nada, fico perdido nestas previsões... Alguém sabe?
4550 2018-12-18 17:35:56 I never 'got' the whole "Let's dip bread in olive oil" thing

4553 2018-12-18 17:35:35 Don’t look at Cushing.  West Texas oil is now trading under $40.  That’s what people should be watching.
4554 2018-12-18 17:35:33 Love me some Macdamia oil esp the masque. Beyond one the best
4555 2018-12-18 17:35:30 Yes, let's turn away that foreign oil and go back to paying a fortune at the pumps for our own local fuel. Here here here, let the rich get richer! Come let's get oil prices up again, I am tired of being able to afford to fill up.
4556 2018-12-18 17:35:22 Yes. We're vegetarians and we're stocking up every week on pulses, pasta, rice, tinned veggies and tinned tomatoes. I'll soon start buying OTC pharmaceutical products, food for our cat and olive oil. No point stocking up on wine as I'd only drink it now, in despair.
4557 2018-12-18 17:35:21 @bhavnasham Hi Bhavna, I'm a journalist working on a documentary about oil wells in LA. I would love to chat with you about your research... could you follow me so I can DM you my details?? Otherwise my email is Lensherriff[at]gmail[dot]com

4559 2018-12-18 17:35:18 @Rodzilla01 @MtgBanker Don't forget that $USO looses its value even if nothing happens to #oil
4560 2018-12-18 17:35:17 Like everything else America steals from Canada, such as #oil and pretty much any other commodity. We are simply an arm of the United States...a #Commodity arm
4561 2018-12-18 17:35:12 Funny how elites think that throwing our tax $ around patching up their failuresnwill solve the problem. The fact remains that they do not want oil to tide water but they want to look like they care for their Eastern voters who are not happy with Trudeau .

4563 2018-12-18 17:35:06 Yes! I tossed them in bowl first with olive oil, honey, garlic/onion powder, pepper, and a little bit of smoked Montreal steak seasoning, then roasted them on top of bacon for around 30 min on 400, broiled for the last 2 min. HEAVEN SENT. The honey took it over the top lol

4568 2018-12-18 17:34:47 $1.5B is in loans.  Why would Oil & Gas seek these loans when they can’t get oil to world markets?

4571 2018-12-18 17:34:36 The Democrats are aware the we aren't buying their snake oil, yet they continue the charade. Even the mockingbird media is showing signs of backing down. People are realizing a truly great man is giving up everything for them.
4572 2018-12-18 17:34:29 It is, after all, the season of giving...
4573 2018-12-18 17:34:23 At a steady $70/barrel oil (optimistic) only about a third of the pre 2014 jobs would return to the oil patch due to automation, etc. 

Fewer jobs means larger labour pool means wage suppression. You're all fighting for the companies more than you are for Albertans. #ableg
4574 2018-12-18 17:34:20 Shit I am getting an oil change and they are so polite and respectful, opened the door for me and all.
4575 2018-12-18 17:34:19 Let’s keep this going, no Carbon Tax/Cap & Trade plus huge growth in natural gas oil drilling (drill baby drill). Lowered payroll taxes and locked in most of the Bush tax cut. He seriously considered cuts to the safety net in a deal that was “thankfully” rejected by the GOP.
4576 2018-12-18 17:34:16 You sound like every other young kid Yankee fan would just see is a big-name and should sign him no matter what. Look around. Take a look at the team. No need for that oil in this water.
4577 2018-12-18 17:34:12 Which of course begs the question why has oil gone down  for 80 days? Not seeing that demand collapse so must be another reason. Right?
4578 2018-12-18 17:34:08 The irony of POTUS talking down oil prices so much... and now oil has to be bailed out.
4579 2018-12-18 17:33:59 Sadly with wind, solar, and water we could drastically cut our need for oil. Even worst is all 'big oil's money lines our congress...
4580 2018-12-18 17:33:57 Prediction: boycott ends with fizzle as lots of people still flock to Whistler and Charles Adler continues to carry oil for addicted Alberta carbon sector.
4581 2018-12-18 17:33:55 You don't get the irony of my statement? When anti pipeline folks protest, oil/gas supporters say they are unemployed welfare bums, cuts both ways.
4582 2018-12-18 17:33:48 If oil prices are tumbling to record lows, shouldn't the price at the pumps also be at record lows? Asking for a friend. Not that I care much about the oil industry; the sooner we abandon our oil addiction, the better. Still . . .
4583 2018-12-18 17:33:38 It is possible that the secret best meal in the world is just an entire pan of sautéed medley of various previously frozen mushrooms cooked with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
4584 2018-12-18 17:33:16 Apparently listening 2industry &implementing things they say our industry needs is “anti oil” &somehow Kenney knows better than people like Steve Williams. Question, if CTs “kill jobs”, why won’t JK call out heads of our industry 4 apparently trying to destroy their own industry?
4585 2018-12-18 17:33:16 To a point I agree but look at the hedge fund that just blew up this month due to the crazy volatility in nat gas and oil.  Trading requires risk, options can help define that risk, but writing options for most is a terrible idea. 1 in 500 will kill you. Not hurt. Kill.
4586 2018-12-18 17:33:14 "The strengthening dollar vis-a-vis gradual rate hikes and balance sheet reduction will continue to play a major factor. The Dow Jones U.S. dollar index is suggesting we may see an additional $15 or more per bl clipped." - Nov. 20 when #oil was $64 - it's now $47.50

4588 2018-12-18 17:33:09 @lorenaforsenate I wanted to chat with you about job replacement for those working in oil and gas. Should I email you, or are you having a Q&A any time soon?
4589 2018-12-18 17:33:03 Dude, you're retiring. What is the point of this disinformation campaign? Do you need something to watch at night when you are lonely on your Oklahoma oil patch?
4590 2018-12-18 17:33:02 I don't know, though- I'd much rather work in a coal mine, on a big oil rig in the ocean, at a fracking site, or in a petrochemical processing plant than building wind farms and installing solar panels - that stuff's just not MANLY!!!

They're coating mountains with solar panels now. Just sayin'.

4603 2018-12-18 17:31:28 They exercised their monopoly power by engaging in anti-competitive practices.

The only reason they could not hold on to their monopoly is that oil, unlike many products and resources, can be found pretty much anywhere.

They could not monopolize the supply.
4604 2018-12-18 17:31:26 I tend to agree.  We've been saying all along that their hand is far stronger than most thought, esp once CNY oil contract launches & is successful.
4605 2018-12-18 17:31:10 I don't think they need to worry too much.

4612 2018-12-18 17:30:14 Very true. It's extraordinary really how his base have gone full on Jonestown for such an obvious feeble minded lying shyster. He's not even got the charm of a snake oil salesman..just the product

4615 2018-12-18 17:30:01 i have used oil but MUCH MORE than recommended and several times per day, not just before bed... "natural" relief methods take longer to be effective than doctor prescription. GIVE IT TIME and can be just as effective.
4616 2018-12-18 17:30:00 For now, #AMLO's main goal for 2019 is to stabilize Pemex's falling oil production. New oil fields are not expected to come online until mid or end of next year. 

The question remains, will Pemex be able to conclude the refineries refurbishments program in time?

4628 2018-12-18 17:28:25 You must of flunked your economic class?  Oil and gas declining causes the overall market to fall and job loses.  Or you and your pal just shorting the markets?  Worst president ever!

4631 2018-12-18 17:28:04 This is @JustinTrudeau logic---find new markets for oil with tax money but kill 2 pipelines; buy the 3rd and mothball it so there's no place to ship it. We're Venezuela with tundra with this guy running the country.
4632 2018-12-18 17:28:00 that's motor oil
4633 2018-12-18 17:27:53 Talking about a green deal then drawing a pic of her driving a car is probably the most hypocritical image I have seen this year. Cars require approx 5 barrels of oil to make.....just for starters.
4634 2018-12-18 17:27:47 Libyans killed Gaddafi to enable the Americans access their oil. In return they were to enjoy the western democracy...and they are enjoying it
4635 2018-12-18 17:27:40 We have flood barriers to protect us from deficits, and oil/gas exporters will receive $1 billion in cash, but no pipelines.

We're plumbing the depths of what has to be just absolute incompetence at the highest levels here. #surreal #cdnpoli

4637 2018-12-18 17:27:29 It is very possible we see the low 30's by February IMO.  Oil is telling the risk markets to wake up!  Thank you for your post @hks55
4638 2018-12-18 17:27:26 Afghanistan has no oil, also Iraq as a war zone closed down several years ago.

4645 2018-12-18 17:26:49 Driver education is key in many cases - several passed numerous ERAs with their fuel warning lights on, one was suspected of deliberately running out of fuel (in order to get b/down recovery ) another stopped on hard shoulder of HSR just because the oil warning light had come on.

4647 2018-12-18 17:26:38 Norwegian State owned oil company Equinor/Statoil paid for NZ private spies Thompson and Clark who paid infiltrators to go into activists groups, now caught in huge scandal in NZ. Do the owners of this company, people of Norway, approve of Stasi-like behaviour on their behalf?
4648 2018-12-18 17:26:24 And these days hardly anyone wants to oil a snake
4649 2018-12-18 17:26:22 All that so called oil was already there in good old telephone directory published by DOT before telecom boom happned Name , address, phone number.   
 Data is new oil if and only if someone works hard to draw relevant patterns and make a business case.
4650 2018-12-18 17:26:17 Yes, OIS outperformance and "sticky" CIDOR. Re hikes, headwinds from weak oil prices, global CB dovishness, tighter global financial conditions could dissuade them from being the standout hawkish g10 CB.
4651 2018-12-18 17:26:13 Pastor John Gray
You owe no one an explanation on how you spend the money you earn, pour onto her like oil, as I’m sure she pours onto you. God bless.
4652 2018-12-18 17:26:10 Standard Oil is an example of a company that built an effective monopoly without government regulation or assistance.

At one point it controlled 88% of all oil refining and petroleum end products.

4654 2018-12-18 17:25:55 The bailout that they hope makes them look good before the election. Now what was the reason that the oil industry took such a sheit kicking?  
4655 2018-12-18 17:25:45 How does investing in renewables make for good economic policy when the rest of the world is ramping up on coal and oil usage.

4665 2018-12-18 17:24:45 Military contractors, big oil and arms manufacturers rely on this recipe, it’s extremely profitable, it’s what builds up the myth of American exceptionalism, that others are backwards barbarians

War is a racket. Smedley Butler knew this, Ike warned of it, military vets know too.
4666 2018-12-18 17:24:42 There has to be something that can be done. These guys are selling our future for a profit today. How can this be legal? They are letting an oil lobbyist run the DOI for f’ks sake! And a coal lobbyist is running the EPA! It’s like a bad movie or something....
4667 2018-12-18 17:24:38 
4668 2018-12-18 17:24:36 Ye kuch African log pagal hai.. They see his fall as a ploy by US and EU to prevent Africa from taking over the world. Miles from reality. Oil price crash did him in
4669 2018-12-18 17:24:35 I love how UYU puts out clothing based on their players' tastes like Oil King's shorts or Qudans' turtleneck, side note Qudans made twt GF this wearing uyu turtleneck, that was sick.
4670 2018-12-18 17:24:35 It will be used by the liberals as an election tool showing their deep concern for the oil industry.  This money will do little to nothing to help anyone in the industry.
4671 2018-12-18 17:24:30 It's funny how the O&G industry whines and lobbies so loudly about a 3% increase in Gross Production Tax yet stays silent about the President's personal policy to bring the price of oil down 30% over the past few months
4672 2018-12-18 17:24:19 Took some $SCO (3X inverse oil) puts this morning and more USO calls.
4673 2018-12-18 17:24:11 Screw the god damn dirty oil patch. Job support? 
Send workers back to their home provinces to work there.
Not every body gets the big bucks. 
This is bullshit. Support all of Canada. What makes Alberta so friggin special. What did Albertans do before the tar sands??  Geezus.!!
4674 2018-12-18 17:24:10 Im committed to becoming a true @lizzo  STAN in 2019. My Song for 2019 song is Cononut Oil.
4675 2018-12-18 17:24:02 My daughter is a little weird. She won’t eat eggs but she’ll gladly drink a spoon of pure cod liver oil.

4678 2018-12-18 17:23:36 Broughty Ferry's answer to David Blaine, eh? 

Mind you my resident Gallic Genius has been cooking them all day without using a hotplate, oil or grease in his new Sous Vide Bath. 
You and Frank should try getting one. Your punters would love the sophisticated results.
4679 2018-12-18 17:23:32 It's a trick question if you don't know that the oil in a 2 stroke goes INTO the gas before you put it in! Ha! Can you imagine how many ppl these days don't know the basic shit like that?
4680 2018-12-18 17:23:30 LETS CALL A SPADE A SPADE,WE ARE GETTING FUCKED BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BIG OIL

4682 2018-12-18 17:23:25 Oh for fuck sake TNB why do you have to blackout the entire neighborhood when I’m trying to burn the midnight oil????? 
4683 2018-12-18 17:23:17 According to @trevortombe 13 billion is all that stays in Canada oil money wise according to one tweet. Seemed like missing context but either way it would be a big loss of business
4684 2018-12-18 17:23:13 sure Oreos are vegan but they have palm oil so
4685 2018-12-18 17:23:03 Is your govt serious! U want 2 aid AB how about killing Bill C48/49. Imposing a carbon tax on foreign oil Saudi, Nigeria, Norway etc   700K barrels/day=$35M sucked out of Canada. Mandate tmx nrg east northern gateway. We don’t need your stinking $!
4686 2018-12-18 17:22:59 No judgement here either! I was actually looking at CBD oil the other day for my dog (sounds crazy I know but her anxiety is awful) what has your experience been with it?
4687 2018-12-18 17:22:48 Well buying weapons from Russia and buying oil is strong and independent decision . Its a good thing
4688 2018-12-18 17:22:44 They be so serious showing the oil dropper thing and telling me how dirty or clean something is. All I can do is smile & nod 
4689 2018-12-18 17:22:43 Notwithstanding clause could have been used although it would have involved a fight in court because it involves FN. However there was already broad support for the pipeline in FN communities because of job spinoffs. 
Trudeau sandbagged the pipeline because he hates oil industry
4690 2018-12-18 17:22:42 The oil sector had been failed before Trudeau got in.  Although he’s no better
4691 2018-12-18 17:22:32 Engine oil
4692 2018-12-18 17:22:32 $Oil should see a bounce off that 47.02 mark
4693 2018-12-18 17:22:29 US is exporting at record highs while SA are importing less oil to US. We are not in a 2015/2016 situation Cushing isn't full, unless a recession kicks in of course.
4694 2018-12-18 17:22:20 Yes introduced in the 80’s and I’m not opposing this. Canada has the most environmentally friendly, ethical oil in the world. Our standards of extraction and transportation are what other countries strive to replicate.
4695 2018-12-18 17:22:04 Cutting imported oil won't save Alberta. Try to diversify to downstream such as petrochemicals. Preferably high technology chemicals.
4696 2018-12-18 17:21:58 Another Trudeau failure.  Subsidize softwood, steel and aluminum, media, Oil, dairy.....Taxpayers footing the bill.
4697 2018-12-18 17:21:58 Great expedition reads......unfortunately am terrible at remembering titles! One with an oil rig and hammerhead sharks comes to mind though......
4698 2018-12-18 17:21:52 I work for Kiehls, and I love everything they make. I don’t know where you’re located, but right now we are running a promotion where if you sign up for the rewards you receive $20 off of a $65 order. Let me know if you’d like to learn more about midnight recovery oil!
4699 2018-12-18 17:21:43 Na verdade nem acho que divergimos na opinião.
Em 2018 o mercado quebrou a cara apostando na correl inversa USD x OIL (e comms in general).
Até tem um princípio macro por trás da correlação inversa. Mas a quebra de correlação foi por gradativa menor liquidez/aumento de juro.
4700 2018-12-18 17:21:30 WTF are you talking about? They but many things from us. Including oil, semiconductors, and soybeans. You really don't have any idea what you are talking about.
4701 2018-12-18 17:21:28 @FamilyExpress oil plunges below $49 a bbl and Gus raises prices...hmmm
4702 2018-12-18 17:21:23 That comment from this radical in Whistler is laughable if not infuriating! Oh no! Your oil is helping to melt my snow???? I thought that our air currents came from Asia? Let’s  all be stupid.
4703 2018-12-18 17:21:22 Leave Oil to the pros.
4704 2018-12-18 17:21:22 The boost is to the oil companies. It is a drop in the bucket and won't help a single worker.
4705 2018-12-18 17:21:19 Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China all remain in the deal (that is all the other signatories) and while the sale of Iranian oil did in fact drop from a bit over 2 million to a bit over 1 million barrels a day at first.....India and China have stepped in filled the gap.
4706 2018-12-18 17:21:19 the minister knows. Going to be two or three generations since O’Connell’s time. I know that those on the oil and gas — well, 4/5
4707 2018-12-18 17:21:13 She is a member of a party whose leader once asked where the money for an Oil fund would come from.
4708 2018-12-18 17:21:07 Oof. At least the #yeg announcement will provide opportunities for employees in Nisku affected by a turn down in the oil industry.
4709 2018-12-18 17:20:54 Getting my car's oil changed and filter replaced. Dealership said it would be an hour wait. Feels like I've waited for over 1.5 hours.
4710 2018-12-18 17:20:47 Oil supplies from Palestine ??
4711 2018-12-18 17:20:27 Oh, yea with a lot of french fries, soda and that vegetable seed oil in shiny bottles used for cooking every meal it's really damaging. But, the meat gets the bad press. Agenda driven "research industry" always focuses on how to benefit the funders.
4712 2018-12-18 17:20:26 Harper and his oil based economy,screwed farmers, gave away CANDU,gave away GM shares, gave a way Ebola cure ,gave away grain board,didn't believe in climate change now @AndrewScheer is next in line with the same mindset
4713 2018-12-18 17:20:26 Omg that looked amazing!!! I want to make her wontons in chilli oil.
4714 2018-12-18 17:20:22 Oil is running out. Everything is fucking running out. Please note theres no planet B for us. Its just this motherfucking earth
4715 2018-12-18 17:20:14 You know it. 
Long over due.

4717 2018-12-18 17:20:05 He wanted help mainly to get at the oil supplies. Also any alliance or uprising in the middle East would make it more difficult for the British to keep order and would occupy British troops
4718 2018-12-18 17:20:03 Unfortunately a move we can’t afford.  Finish the contract & don’t do business in any way with Saudi Arabia in future, including buying their oil starting now.  Canada needs to be able to use only our own oil.
4719 2018-12-18 17:20:02 Snake oil salesman.
4720 2018-12-18 17:20:01 Please anyone selling pure coconut oil in Abuja??! 

Please retweet my seller might be on your TL
4721 2018-12-18 17:19:59 Handing out cash/loan is a It’s an ultra short term solution. Federal govt ,Please get a proper framework/ infrastructure/pipeline to push the oil to international markets. We don’t want to sell to a single market. This not going to workout. Govt intervention is always danger.
4722 2018-12-18 17:19:57 Kurdistan has effectively been created through US actions. To be in America's pocket. 2003 invasion was hope to get Kirkuk oil for it. Now plan is to probably annex Syrian land with oil instead for them.
4723 2018-12-18 17:19:48 We also gave oil companies 20.5 billion in subsidies in 2017.
4724 2018-12-18 17:19:41 

not sure how one would get tulip oil, but the iso e super is actually a thing-it's a synthetic Woody smell that smells pretty good actually...i believe you can buy it on eBay, and it was also released as a fragrance straight-up (it can make other scents last longer)
4725 2018-12-18 17:19:40 1.6 Billion to Alberta for help with the Oil “crisis”. 

When it was booming, $0.45 per liter for gas while the rest of us paid 0.96 I must of missed the memo of where to pick up my share of the fortune at that time. Poor use of tax payer money.
4726 2018-12-18 17:19:40 Exactly!! He needs experience and to get off the oil teat!! No Beto. Maybe in 8 years
4727 2018-12-18 17:19:37 this oil change is taking entirely too long and i just wanna get chikfila and take a nap
4728 2018-12-18 17:19:33 One quick follow up: you mention in your talk at Strand that natural gas fracking companies financials are quite different than oil fracking companies.  You have a different opinion of gas vs. oil frackers then?  Book focused on companies with oil as the primary?
4729 2018-12-18 17:19:20 Let this sink in: This man and others led chants of "Lock her up" when it came to Hillary Clinton. Now he could very well be locked up himself. To anyone who has drunk the Trump snake oil:  Are you not 'woke' yet?

4732 2018-12-18 17:18:59 @RachelNotley| Good decision from Feds & Trudeau. Those who repeated that Alberta's oil is "dirty energy" are non sense people, similar to those who want to continue to eat meat but do not want to have a slaughterhouse in their region. Legault and sidekicks must only ride bicycle

4743 2018-12-18 17:18:13 Glad my dad know how to do a oil change 
4744 2018-12-18 17:18:11 Attention is edging out oil as the planet’s most valuable commodity. And it’s picking up the baton of making the planet uninhabitable.
4745 2018-12-18 17:18:05 Most shale oil producers aren’t even cash flow positive. This won’t end well.
4746 2018-12-18 17:18:04 My house is full of Christmas cookies and I just stir-fried green beans and garlic in sesame oil for a snack instead. Who have I become?
4747 2018-12-18 17:18:02 @IngrahamAngle Laura, my fellow Polish friend, I came to Texas to take care of the phony oil shortage in 1979. I’m old NOW & now we need to STAND OUR GROUND!  We need to override political . Please someone start & a WALL go fund me. $90.00 each TRUMP VOTER. I’M FOR THAT 
4748 2018-12-18 17:17:58 He didn't waste this opportunity to blame Harper govt for the sad state of oil and gas.  Singing the only song they know over and over again.  Libs are the only ones to blame.
4749 2018-12-18 17:17:55 “Hey Vlad, great idea here! 
Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s supply and wreck our economy! 
We might even end up with a GDP even lower than LA County where it currently is.”

4756 2018-12-18 17:17:23 There was no reason oil went up. We had over supply last year.

4758 2018-12-18 17:17:07 What I meant is that if they go BK or quit producing, there will be less oil. That would raise oil prices if that loss of production is large enough.I’m not saying they will come back bc of higher prices.
4759 2018-12-18 17:16:58 Don’ t forget that whatever Trudeau does it will never be to bring oil to tide water. It will be to keep his votes. It will be to look like he is helping Alberta for his Eastern voters. He is the Globalist clown who wants a seat at the UN. The new World order Goverment!
4760 2018-12-18 17:16:50 This is the best event ever. Bring back 2015!!!  Kill the zombie drillers who rely on low rates to fund.  Then the large oil names acquire all the bottom fracker feeders and then we go to 100+
4761 2018-12-18 17:16:22 If you look at core SCOOP, STACK and Permian, $40 oil provides 20% ROR. Acreage costs are another troubled factor

#OOTT
4768 2018-12-18 17:15:46 That's great but how about stopping the resistance to the pipeline so that Alberta and Saskatchewan can get their economies back on track? No matter how hard to resist oil, it is here to fuel the world until there is an alternative. Stop punishing those that work in the industry
4769 2018-12-18 17:15:45 Yeah hopefully it lines up like that. Insider buying with that vol last time was such a gimme lets pray we get it again. I agree the recent breakdown of oil looks nasty but it may turn around tomorrow if the market turns up hard.
4770 2018-12-18 17:15:44 
4771 2018-12-18 17:15:37 "efficient market" was sarcasm if you were wondering. Oil hasn't had an efficient market since never. Outlined in my pinned tweet.

4784 2018-12-18 17:14:52 They can’t. Russia is in recession. Low oil prices hurt Russia since their budget is based on oil at $50. At least it was last year.
4785 2018-12-18 17:14:47 I had a car like that, an old beetle. Not sure if the gauge was broken or it didn’t have one but I had to use a stick. Now you don’t even have to check your oil or tire pressure.

4790 2018-12-18 17:14:28 @jonnajarian oil lower is only I say only a positive for consumer which is 2/3 economy. Oil is only 5% of market. The lower the oil the better cost for company’s consumer savings expand. Ludicrous to say it’s bad for oil to be low.

4792 2018-12-18 17:14:23 The help is simply re-payable  loans, which they should be.   The fact is this is useless if they can get oil to markets!
4793 2018-12-18 17:14:21 The fake media are drowning over Arab oil money.
4794 2018-12-18 17:14:20 Will Tanzania ever benefit from its natural resources? Can Tsnzania really turn its riches i.e minerals, oil and gas into tangible wealth for the benefit of its citizens?As it is undisputable that resource rich countries hav done even more poorly than countries without resources.
4795 2018-12-18 17:14:09 Trudeau shouldn't be giving handouts to the oil industry. Building pipelines would be more beneficial to the overall economy
4796 2018-12-18 17:14:08 Every time Amarjeet Sohi, the Minister of Natural Resources, talks about Canadian oil&gas it just amazing to see how little he understands it.
It is so obvious he doesn't actually talk to leaders in the industry.

4797 2018-12-18 17:14:03 Members of parliament have used the term "burnt the midnight oil" if only you did something of worth at the time.#corruption #scandles #pesayauma
4798 2018-12-18 17:13:58 they need to adopt their own rhetoric and back Labours position, but they won't because they are just snake oil salesmen
4799 2018-12-18 17:13:51 Minister @SohiAmarjeet just announced $1.6B more public money for oil companies, and then re-instated Ottawa's supposed commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in the same presser. The Orwellian double-speak of this government continues to gall. #cdnpoli
4800 2018-12-18 17:13:51 They fry everything in peanut oil! That’s why !
4801 2018-12-18 17:13:50 ouuuuuuf mac's soft n gentle highlighter + baby oil!!!! a GODLY combination
4802 2018-12-18 17:13:41  US oil blessed me
4803 2018-12-18 17:13:40 With oil falling economy is in good shape. All he needs is do couple of big things(not waivers) and narrative will be his.
4804 2018-12-18 17:13:39 I want someone not tied to oil/gas/mining in any way.
4805 2018-12-18 17:13:37 Give me the oil monopoly and I will gladly go back to 1916. Tone and all.
4806 2018-12-18 17:13:37 well... too much oil / money... makes you fat and lazy. As For your article. Sunnis outnumber Shi'a like 10 to 1. If Iran were to ever attack SA. I am sure Egypt and Turkey would be involved. It would WW3. It's just a headline. Don't look too much into it.
4807 2018-12-18 17:13:33 These low oil prices need to help my $LUV trade get itself out of the gutter.
4808 2018-12-18 17:13:29 А доллар батюшка расти стал
4809 2018-12-18 17:13:05 Pouring a little grease or cooking oil down your household drain can lead to big problems. These problems could include clogs and back-ups to your sewer system, which could result in costly repairs.
4810 2018-12-18 17:12:57 Voot pe jake dekho sab log mahnat karte hai but editors are only showing bhai bahen episode's..(for fixed sreeshant) .and shree ki head oil massage dipika ka head massage..hair dye karna etc etc rudhana manana..salon khula hai Kya .
Aab change karo episode ke characters ko..
4811 2018-12-18 17:12:56 Usually olive oil, but avocado and coconut are always on my list. I love walnut oil in salads. Have you use ghee? Since you’re vegan probably not.. im not vegan but plant based for the most part. Transitioning, ever transitioning. What oils do you use??
4812 2018-12-18 17:12:47 About coconut oil is good for certain skin type but it’s bad for people that have closed comedone (like me) bc it uses lipids from the coconut as resource and causing more skin bumps
4813 2018-12-18 17:12:34 Liberals answer to every one of their many failures is to use taxpayers money to bail out: oil patch, bombardier, the media.....
4814 2018-12-18 17:12:34 Uh No?  We were already at the lowest long/short ratio since the worst of the oil collapse. That one was fundamentally driven positioning with some short speculation, this one is purely long panic and short speculation.
4815 2018-12-18 17:12:33 Yoooo I forgot how key cod liver oil is

sorry mom
4816 2018-12-18 17:12:23 Rather than a bogus handout maybe an exemption  on having to pay equalization to provinces that hold the oil and gas sector back, then we can take care of ourselves.
4817 2018-12-18 17:12:18 Oh gosh, we just pumped up Petterson vs McDavid and incurred a mighty oil soaked wrath..  gotta put Oilers nation in there.
4818 2018-12-18 17:12:14 The U.S. has become the world's largest producer of oil at a record 11.7 million barrels per day, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.
4819 2018-12-18 17:12:12 #Devon At Clyst St Mary on Oil Mill Lane we've got reports there's flooding.[SG]
4820 2018-12-18 17:12:06 WTI oil continues to push lower down $1.32 this morning to $48.56 as U.S. oil production grows, doubts of OPEC cuts.
4821 2018-12-18 17:11:53 Comey is so greasy, should tap him for oil
4822 2018-12-18 17:11:52 knew Saddam would use it to kill off his foes- giving them the excuse to take him out. US can’t ‘legally’ attack without approval from Congress which is obv easy to fool with rigged data, faked testimony

But when Saddam gassed the Kurds, Bush did nothing, no invasion. Why? > Oil
4823 2018-12-18 17:11:49 omg so worth it, some days i just don’t wear make up cause it makes it look like your face is clear (sounds so dumb but true), if you do use make up just use oil free micellar water and a cotton bud to get it off at the lash line - they’re more durable than you’d think
4824 2018-12-18 17:11:38 @jayrayner1 my key supplier has calmly gone about working out the effect of no deal tariffs. They report:-

Canned tuna up 24%
Canned tomatoes up 14.4%
Olive oil up 35-45%
Pork up 50% 

Not sure how we manage this
4825 2018-12-18 17:11:20 Seriously. WTH is going on?! And 2 months ago they were saying oil was going to $90.. how can sentiment change THAT drastically in such a short time
4826 2018-12-18 17:11:20 WTI #oil is down >5% falling briefly below $47 a barrel | #OOTT
4827 2018-12-18 17:11:13 US oil production in the last two years increased at the same rate it did in the two years prior to 2014,  but with HALF the number of rigs operating
4828 2018-12-18 17:11:09 Penemuan termuktahir menjelang akhir tahun ini. TO rose face oil, bruntusan lenyap dalam semalam.
4829 2018-12-18 17:10:46 But where do we stop retreating from progress? All the clamor for renewable energy resources... "BUT..."... Where I live they just stopped wind farm. In AZ they stopped solar facility... Self destructive behavior. If not dams,...there will be increased oil&coal usage,certainly.
4830 2018-12-18 17:10:43 An emergency like an oil shock? I'll be sure to do that, Mr. Fake Account.
4831 2018-12-18 17:10:42 The pink pussy oil smells so good
4832 2018-12-18 17:10:41 Hays sana oil HAHAAHAH
4833 2018-12-18 17:10:31 why does Quebec need #equalization?
billions for #Albertaoil,
billions for #cars and #nuclear power plants in #Ontario,
#billions for oil and #dams in #Newfoundland,
#crumbs for #aeronautics, #lumber, ... because it's in #Quebec?
4834 2018-12-18 17:10:27 Lol, you never know what BS you're getting from Cpt #Peoplekind & his merry band of misfits. WORST PRIME MINISTER EVER! Broken Ethical Laws. Highest Debt Ever! Over pays for leaky Oil pipeline! Huge waste of hard working CA tax payers $ trying to be the celebrity world Saviour.

4837 2018-12-18 17:10:02 We have had a supply glut for years. The good is gas is cheap and people have more money to spend. The bad is companies will cut back on production and probably cut jobs.   The best-low oil prices hurt Russia which is already in a recession.
4838 2018-12-18 17:10:01 Pretty sure the Punisher one smells like gun oil and Drakkar Noir.
4839 2018-12-18 17:10:00 According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas’ annual oil production increased by over 225 percent from 2007 to 2017 thanks to fracking.
4840 2018-12-18 17:09:59 Let’s not forget, my personal favorite, SLIDE SOME OIL
4841 2018-12-18 17:09:48 The amphibious @michaelgove uses words! Then supports damaging policies like the badger cull, HS2, Hinckley etc etc. Bugger off Michael you tortuous oil slick!
4842 2018-12-18 17:09:45 That's good advice, I'll need a scaple and some 30 weight motor oil
4843 2018-12-18 17:09:44 Today's announcement by Trudeau government of $1.6 billion to help Alberta oil sector smacks of desperation. It sees yellow vest-style rallies in Alberta and thinks, "There goes our climate change partner – better throw some money at Alberta."
4844 2018-12-18 17:09:37 Was the Premier of Alberta at the announcement by Fedeal Gov in Alberta around the $1.6 Billion funding to help out the province oil industy? Do not think so. No provincial representative standing up there with feds unusual.
4845 2018-12-18 17:09:37 Getting an oil change and watch these bozos come back and tell me everything that’s wrong with my car. I think they be breaking stuff on purpose tryna get over on me ...
4846 2018-12-18 17:09:36 There is US oil going to Quebec, and the rest is Canadian oil. No Saudi oil.
4847 2018-12-18 17:09:35 i got some oil for my wax pen and they said if i hit this one time i’m gone be high  let me test the theory
4848 2018-12-18 17:09:31 Daily Routine (Morning)

- Mix of conditioner, oil, water. 
- Spray onto hands and apply to twist as you undo. 
- Or lightly spray onto head then undo twists. 
- Do not over pull, stretch, manipulate
4849 2018-12-18 17:09:25 I had SUCH high CBD oil, needless to say I have a lot left over. Too bad delivery was sublingual via a dropper otherwise I could give it away. lolol
4850 2018-12-18 17:09:21 Monumentally wrong Jesse @TheBubbleBubble more consolidation coming which will give majors more price control. #Oil prices will rise 50% in H1 2019 supporting earnings. Despite volatility, #oil keeps touching equilibrium. Better than most of global #economy.
4851 2018-12-18 17:09:14 Horrible call on oil.  Just really bad
4852 2018-12-18 17:09:11 Baby Oil
4853 2018-12-18 17:09:08 nails bitch i’m dying !!! I need to be human again! you get oil changes for free 
4854 2018-12-18 17:09:02 路是永远走不对的！世界是由罗斯柴尔德等金融大鳄掌控的。李嘉诚还属于光明会13血缘家族呢，收购加拿大Husky Oil的86%的股份，没影子政府同意，根本不可能。
罗斯柴尔德拥有和掌控世界160多个国家的央行，中国央行”中国人民银行“的一部分都属于罗斯柴尔德。罗氏让哪个国家跪着，哪个国家就得跪！
4855 2018-12-18 17:08:59 Educate yourself hellwinger. Illegals are Mexico's 2nd largest revenue income, first being wealthy Mexico's government owned oil company. THAT'S why they send their poor and un/under-educated to our country to take jobs from citizens & those here legally. Some friend & neighbor,
4856 2018-12-18 17:08:59 So a woman that ran for some political positions in my state was asking on Twitter what could help her anxiety and all but 2 people said CBD oil. TOO BAD ALABAMA REFUSES TO MAKE IT LEGAL!!!
4857 2018-12-18 17:08:57 I ain’t shit cause my oil change is more important but damn a butch hates sitting there for hours 
4858 2018-12-18 17:08:54 Use tea tree oil
4859 2018-12-18 17:08:44 I know it was tired and dirty but that previous drive is a classic interwar 'oil drip' layout, and a well-construicted one too, that was popular as car ownership took off in the 20s/30s....and leaky engines had a habit of disfiguring new concrete or bitmac.

Where's the site?
4860 2018-12-18 17:08:39 I don’t disagree. Right on LNG. Was just commenting on oil production. Presumably that growth is lower if prices stay here
4861 2018-12-18 17:08:27 desecrating the gravesite???  no no, i'm anointing it with holy oil, which just happens to be piss
4862 2018-12-18 17:08:25 debating between a new set of nails or an oil change 
4863 2018-12-18 17:08:19 Thanks for more toxicity in the air and soil Big Oil!! 

(Not to mention the St. Louis estuary..)
4864 2018-12-18 17:08:18 6.  Doesn't know what kind of oil to put in 4 cycle engine.................(trick question)
4865 2018-12-18 17:08:17 If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly, you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage.
4866 2018-12-18 17:08:15 So $1.6B in govt assistance to OIL & Gas is in the form of repayable loans at Commercial rates.   So smoke & mirrors in assistance.  The fact is they can’t get product to markets except USA.
4867 2018-12-18 17:08:02 Someone that lied to his wife that he's working in oil company, you want them to see him driving danfo?  
4868 2018-12-18 17:07:58 The shale oil boom was just getting started wen Obama took office.  Oil production is up on private land and down on federal land.  Oil production was up because of private efforts. Obama was focusing on green energy, Bush did green energy too.
4869 2018-12-18 17:07:54 Water cleanse, vitamin c and sunscreen in the morning. Moisturiser if skin is feeling dry.

Charcoal cleanser, lactic acid (alternate days), niacinamide, moisturiser and oil at night.

Once a week: AHA + BHA acid.
4870 2018-12-18 17:07:52 If they’re red or purple they’ll fade after the baby! Coco butter, bio oil or vitamin E oil!
4871 2018-12-18 17:07:51 I’m crocheting while I get my oil changed. I’ve reached a new tier of old lady.
4872 2018-12-18 17:07:44 Most of it coming to my home province of #NewBrunswick for refining then distributed around the country for hockey mum's to use. Embarrassing. We got rid of "Blood Diamonds". Let's do the same with unethical oil.

4874 2018-12-18 17:07:28 Did Sohi just say that in situ oil sands projects were definitively not on the project list for Environmental Assessment?
4875 2018-12-18 17:07:25 هناك فرق بين

النفط الصخري Shale Oil
و هو نفط سائل داخل مسام صخور عديمة النفاذية. 
يتم استخراجها بالتكسير الهيدرولوكي.
إنتاجه أغلى من النفط التقليدي

و الصخر النفطي Oil Shale
و هي مادة صلبة عضوية(الكيروجين) ممكن تحويلها إلى نفط عن طريق التسخين.
إنتاجه أغلى من الصخري و التقليدي

4878 2018-12-18 17:07:07 Cheese quesadillas, scrambled eggs with cheese and ham, quinoa with cheese and oil and vinegar (my kid loves that stuff) those are a few of our go toos!
4879 2018-12-18 17:07:03 yesterday my face was growing something akin to a cyst, so i put coconut oil on it and put a bandaid over it to deter picking and it actually DECREASED in size. i feel like i cheated the system.
4880 2018-12-18 17:06:49 While we’ve been sick, we’ve been on that peppermint & eucalyptus oil hard AF 
4881 2018-12-18 17:06:48 They sanction Venezuela. Adding to the starvation of the people. Clearly the USA is after the oil. Not the poors of course. Too late now Russians will get a deal and nothing for the USA. Very good thing.
4882 2018-12-18 17:06:44 I've tried the engine building demo. It's good fun until you realize you forgot an engine seal on the crankshaft when you've just bolted the oil pan on. 
4883 2018-12-18 17:06:31 He also gave loan to J.P Morgan
Gave oil refinery idea to John rockafeller
He also played a master stroke by giving ittefaq foundry scrap steel to Andrew carnigie.
4884 2018-12-18 17:06:27 I'm usually good at cooking.
But does anybody know how much cannabis oil I should put in my mashed potatoes?
4885 2018-12-18 17:06:26 IMO yes...falling oil = US funding crisis is brought forward, rapidly
4886 2018-12-18 17:06:19 What kind of meds?  And I'm not a 'snake oil' kind of person, as in I don't think a crystal and essential oil will help much of anything, but I do like natural things, like different kinds of tea to help relax or things like that
4887 2018-12-18 17:06:15 I want u all to know that my witchy remedies worked and I am very proud of myself for healing strep throat on my own without a Dr. Will be continuing a regimen of natural antibiotics in the form of oregano oil, colloidal silver, & turmeric to mitigate contagiousness.
4888 2018-12-18 17:06:11 it’s everywhere across the board.. look at oil companies $hk $sd chapter 11 is a nice shelter “rinse and repeat”

4890 2018-12-18 17:06:04 Growth fears grip world markets ahead of Fed meeting: World stock markets, the U.S. dollar and oil prices tumbled on Tuesday as fears about a slowing global economy gripped investors, just as the U.S. Federal Reserve looks set this week to deliver its fourth interest rate hike…
4891 2018-12-18 17:06:03 Thanks for joining us! We always welcome the opportunity to tout the benefits of Louisiana's oil and natural gas industry.
4892 2018-12-18 17:06:01 The drop in oil is hurting markets. You still want low oil?
4893 2018-12-18 17:05:47 So...still no pipelines to get oil their selling product to tide water! Liberals are great at throwing tax$ to say :” look ,we give the, $$” but does this really solve their problem? NO!  This goverment bought a pipeline to make sure none will be twin and they will not build one!
4894 2018-12-18 17:05:41 Mauu lip matte make over/ l'oreal oil
4895 2018-12-18 17:05:39 Meanwhile cbd oil sales are up... coincidence? 
4896 2018-12-18 17:05:34 Kiehl's is SO expensive here. I wish I could splurge on the midnight recovery oil. I've been coveting it for so long!
4897 2018-12-18 17:05:34 The washout in shale mostly occurred in 2015-16. Many companies produce from FCF now. Tech already reduced workforce. Short cycle is fine given we are at the beginning of the end of the #oil age. #Shale is #FreedomFromOPEC by Q4 2019. Next is gentle arc to lower demand by 2030.
4898 2018-12-18 17:05:30 How's that gender gap doing in the oil sands and coal industry?
4899 2018-12-18 17:05:25 I already heard something similar from rebel supporters three years ago. Locals collect hundreds of oil tankers every day and sell gasoline in Idlib, where demand is always great - is it necessary to fill battle tanks and pickups with something?
4900 2018-12-18 17:05:15 Pricing in a recession IMO. Gas cracks super strong. Think crude is trading on spec macro numbers and gas trading on fundamentals. Cash oil is relatively strong. Macro tourists at it again. Also, long oil, and have lost trying to catch that nasty knife!
4901 2018-12-18 17:05:09 Energy Sector news.   Minister Sohi : we will help Oil & Gas to get to other markets.   Without pipelines to the coasts how exactly will that happen?
4902 2018-12-18 17:05:04 Hell yea bud let’s do it all I got scheduled is getting an oil change on Saturday morning I think
4903 2018-12-18 17:05:02 wild growth oil smell so weird but I fw it
4904 2018-12-18 17:04:59 My teens really want a serious art lab with instructors. They want to try pottery, glasswork, oil painting... (but they want to do so outside of school because they want to be experimental and not need finished product on deadline and graded)
4905 2018-12-18 17:04:53 As long as we’ve got jets, car, trucks and ships, homes to hear plus a need for plastics, etc., we’ll need oil and gas. 
 has a hockey sock full of gas and oil. It’s ethically produced and we need to get it developed and transported to grow our economy.

4907 2018-12-18 17:04:40 Which oil in Zimbabwe??
4908 2018-12-18 17:04:38 You previously recommended oil not salve as not one area and said you would give me 20% discount. Please let me know price of oil.
4909 2018-12-18 17:04:36 My morning was great. I prayed with a police officer & I got my oil changed
4910 2018-12-18 17:04:34 Vai pra cadeia !
4911 2018-12-18 17:04:34 @joerogan hey what cbd oil what you talking about that ted nugget uses now and you also talked about with dale jr.   I would like to try it.
4912 2018-12-18 17:04:32 Weed didn't work though it was a fun night lol...cbd oil was a no go too 
4913 2018-12-18 17:04:29 Turmeric Curcumin supplements help me quite a good bit. Non THC CBD oil is also a good fix, but Alabama has yet to make it legal 
4914 2018-12-18 17:04:27 There are many refineries in the world that can only handle sweet light crude, but as that is starting to be depleted worldwide, refineries will have to be upgrades. There is nothing uniquely different about the Oil Sands. Sour Heavy Crude presents the same issues.
4915 2018-12-18 17:04:25 Pake bio oil beli di guardian atau watson , ku dah hampir setahun lepas krim tun
4916 2018-12-18 17:04:21 Ambitious action on climate will be resisted by the oil and gas industry but the public will be receptive if it is embedded in socially responsible fiscal policy. That, however, requires a much higher level of 'joined up government' than we have at present.
4917 2018-12-18 17:04:11 Pretty simple - if JT is part of Canada after the next election, then AB can't be.

Can't mix oil and water.
4918 2018-12-18 17:04:05 @JustinTrudeau @DarrenFisherNS how many more billions will you waste on the tar sands? Stop wasting our taxes on oil and invest in Alberta diversification! #nomoretarsands
4919 2018-12-18 17:04:05 CBD Oil Please.
4920 2018-12-18 17:04:04 I’m so tired. I dropped a little hot oil on my arm 
4921 2018-12-18 17:03:59 Definitely use a spray or oil! There’s tons of brands out there I like jambo superfoods you can get it online! If not I have a few other recommendations, let me know! 
4922 2018-12-18 17:03:54 My point is that a municipality can do a bunch of finger pointing at the oil industry but I can almost guarantee you there’s skeletons in their own closet somewhere.

4930 2018-12-18 17:02:48 Isn’t the gilets jaunes a group protesting the crazy high tax on oil in France which predominantly affects the rural middle class?
4931 2018-12-18 17:02:33 "Thank goodness Export Development Canada and the Business Development have more money," SAID NO OIL WORKER EVER.

If @JustinTrudeau really cares about struggling families in the energy sector, he can pull C-69, get pipelines built and scrap the carbon tax.

4939 2018-12-18 17:02:05 About a decade ago, a fog like this would have caused the price of oil to boost by $2-3 in a single trading session.

4946 2018-12-18 17:01:52 @CBCNews the reason Mr. Harper did not fund the oil and gas industry to the level you are having to help us is because he did not have to because it was doing just fine until you came along and detroyed Alberta with your regulatory mess. The package you are offering is worthless
4947 2018-12-18 17:01:47 This country is really frustrating. Imagine over 5 oil companies have not been remitting money into the treasury—over 1 billion dollars o ( which I am sure is even more than this figure).

- Will still hate Trudeau after he bails them out/ helps offset the current oil crisis
4987 2018-12-18 16:59:34 That all Americans stop driving their kids to school and the mall?  There is no Bear case for Oil in the medium term, and in the longer medium term, there is only a Bull case for all energy sources. More people, more production of goods, more electricity, more possibilities.
4988 2018-12-18 16:59:21 Also. To answer this directly it's on the job training. How many mechanics would hire a kid out of high school with no skills to fetch oil/tools/etc, sweep up the shop and teach them skills to make them more valuable in the workplace?

You can get paid to learn
4989 2018-12-18 16:59:20 Oh really, so they've once again done the research. Marvellous. Utter nonsense of course but it makes a shallow, throw away talking point while continuing to support the very environmentally aware oil companies. Good job BBC

4994 2018-12-18 16:59:03 @realDonaldTrump You've helped beat down the price of oil, and the oil companies  -- it's very hurtful to people who have invested in America's quest to be energy independent. I'm a big supporter, but this beat down of the oil industry is uncalled for -- please give it a rest.
4995 2018-12-18 16:58:55 In fairness, it was a crisis manufactured by the MSM to create a difference between the two big oil puppet parties. Andrew and Justin played their assigned roles perfectly. They win, the earth loses.

5017 2018-12-18 16:56:54 Well, without oil at all sounds like a pretty bad idea. But bad oil shoul be as good as "good oil". Only if you love your car very much and want to keep it for the rest of your life you should invest into fancy oil :)
5018 2018-12-18 16:56:51 Plz tell her to give us oil at $48 a barrel.
This will greatly benefits us.
5019 2018-12-18 16:56:41 Dr.MMS always found money to cater to welfare measures criticized by so called experts as drain on economy.Yet the economy did better. With a bonanza in the form of lower oil prices this Govt has given us a growth which even under the gravest world financial crisis was not as bad
5020 2018-12-18 16:56:32 It’s mostly civilian trade. That’s what you’re not understanding. Civilians collect the oil and refine it. They sell it to truckers, who sell it to gas stations, the ruling party takes a cut.
5021 2018-12-18 16:56:31 Im not really seeing any huge votes of confidence like that yet, seeing some decent insider buys on names like $VII.to, $TOU.to, $KEL.to. I think when the huge inside buys line up with what looks like some sort of a bottom will be key. Oil price says we aren't at bottom yet

RIP Mr. Khashoggi.  It's terrible that our own president traded your life for lower oil prices.

What's worse is he bragged about it.

5037 2018-12-18 16:55:22 Oil will never go above $50 again in my lifetime
5038 2018-12-18 16:55:22 Bloomberg reporting Saudi budget for 2019 based on oil price assumption of USD80 a barrel, versus USD72 average this year. Seems optimistic at this stage. They also estimate the budget balances now at USD95 a barrel, which seems to have increased again.
5039 2018-12-18 16:55:21 US oil prices tumbled more than 2% to $48.75 a barrel. At one point, crude traded as low as $47.84 a barrel -- the weakest price since September 2017.
5040 2018-12-18 16:55:15 The ruling elite have a never ending stream of income from their oil wells. They are filthy rich but do not spread the wealth. Take a close look at the skin color of the Mexican leaders to confirm this.

5044 2018-12-18 16:54:51 Ted isn't smart enough to consider the factors that affect a falling DOW...like, FED increasing interest rates, OPEC significantly cutting the production of crude oil, etc.

But he'll keep on lying and the leftist base will keep on crying...I wish there was a stock for that!
5045 2018-12-18 16:54:51 I've been using a new-fangled microwave popper that uses no oil and then lightly dusting with the exact-same butter-flavored salt that movie theaters use. A lot of it won't stick without oil, but it's pretty good!
5046 2018-12-18 16:54:45 For consumers its down to running costs and keeping warm, H.P.s can be expensive to run in poorly insulated homes as we all know electricity costs more than gas & oil, 'Insulate before Generate'
5047 2018-12-18 16:54:42 Alberta  reducing emissions is irrelevent... the upstream efficiency matters little.... they ignore the fact someone ends up burning it. 

the oil when burned is something like 80% of the total contribution of CO2. 

317kg of CO2 produced per barrel...

5054 2018-12-18 16:54:13 CW uncomfortable slurs

Some people call them trannys. As in like “the tranny needs rebuilt” or “i need some tranny oil” etc. its not used as a slur in that regard its just short for transmission. But that word obviously is a slur towards us when used in other contexts
5055 2018-12-18 16:54:08 Petróleo $WTI 47.15 -2.73 (-5.47%)
Crude oil
5056 2018-12-18 16:54:06 ไม่รู้จะอธิบายความรู้สึกนี้ยังไง
มันอธิบายออกมาเป็นคำพูดไม่ได้
จะต้องเจ็บอีกสักกี่ครั้งงง
5057 2018-12-18 16:54:05 @ESPNCleveland Chick Fil A is the best. Preparation, presentation, quality and customer service. Who else pressure dries their chicken in peanut oil? No one.
5058 2018-12-18 16:54:05 During his term all my friends lost their jobs!!!! Now all of hem are making money in the oil industry and supporting their families!!! And 2019 looks even brighter!!!!
5059 2018-12-18 16:54:01 im soo mystified...corn oil comes from corn, vegetable oil from vegetables, baby oil.........? �9
5060 2018-12-18 16:53:46 No one known just an oil pastel painting I came across on pinterest and I tried to make it,it also relates to my username

5064 2018-12-18 16:53:28 I love when 30 something year old white women try to talk to me like I am a young, naive child and then I tell them I am also a 30 something and they ask my skincare routine. I just wanna be like BISH I'M BLACK AND BLACK DONT CRACK but I act wild and tell them to eat coconut oil
5065 2018-12-18 16:53:21 The struggle to find Black hair care products in this little town continues! This year, all I want for Christmas is some coconut oil. 
5066 2018-12-18 16:53:19 Gwe oil mulalu so yes you would 
5067 2018-12-18 16:53:15 You’ll be an oil baron in your next life 
5068 2018-12-18 16:53:14 The #Albertans think their #oil is black #gold, but officials know it's black #shit:
oil too #thick, too #asphaltic, too #viscous, too #expensive to extract, which contains few products to #distill and must therefore #crack it which is more expensive and #energy intensive?
5069 2018-12-18 16:53:10 ABSTRACT by Patrascu

5070 2018-12-18 16:53:04 They will end up in each others arms , the only love they know is this fighting and boiling cooking oil .
5071 2018-12-18 16:53:00 Hey Andy.... where are all the pipelines You built from 2010-2015... when oil prices were $100/barrel?  Oh yeah...there were none!! #lying #Hypocrite
5072 2018-12-18 16:52:58 But gold diggers dig until they find oil 
5073 2018-12-18 16:52:57 Nak beli cleansing oil yang rm20 pun fikir sampai 2-3 kali.
5074 2018-12-18 16:52:54 Along the causeway from JB, and we see a bunch of tank trucks. My Sister thinks it’s transporting petrol, my mom thinks it’s palm oil.
My dad: I think it’s cooking oil

5075 2018-12-18 16:52:51 "The US government also cites reports that the general was involved in  bribery and “planned to organize attacks by mercenaries on South  Sudanese oil fields and infrastructure, in an effort to create a problem  that only his company and affiliates could solve.”
5076 2018-12-18 16:52:45 Oil demand raises every year. Renewables may take over one day but it is generations down the road. We still need oil now and into the future. Could you live oil free right now? I think not. You have been brainwashed by foreign interests looking to harm our energy industry.

5078 2018-12-18 16:52:44 baru bgt kejadian. mau pake serum malah pake oil lash ke muka, gara2 ngambil botolnya gapake kacamata;(
5079 2018-12-18 16:52:42 Frequent oil changes.
5080 2018-12-18 16:52:35 Jose is my dude man. Soon as I pulled in the dealership he said “I thought you were done with me after you got your engine” lol heck naw I’ll only ever get a oil change at the dealership from now on
5081 2018-12-18 16:52:25 How u going to protect from oil spills and the damage to sea and land animals.
5082 2018-12-18 16:52:18 Pack a small bag and check my oil. Because who knows where life’s going to take me today. Skyblue 
5083 2018-12-18 16:52:13 Congratulations to the winner of yesterday’s 5th Day of Christmas gift card to the Olive Oil Marketplace is .......Whitney Meeks. Let us know to which charity we should donate in your name. Today's contest is already posted.   The next winner could be you. 
5084 2018-12-18 16:52:08 Oil over 5% lower currently at $47.60 - got to be painful for some oil rich countries. Looking forward to a fall at the pump here in the UK where we are still paying approx 1.30 GBP a litre,
5085 2018-12-18 16:52:07 $BPT Free Falling! With Oil Under $50 $USO just do a simple comparison of where this should be trading at that price! Hello Obvious Short!
5086 2018-12-18 16:52:04 2 The artificial shortage has now migrated to things like fuel, cooking oil and other basic commodities not forgetting beer and fizzy drinks
5087 2018-12-18 16:51:52 Today in a Los Angeles suburb, an erratic billionaire is getting a bunch of free advertising for digging a hole to put cars in. THIS IS NOT TRANSIT. THIS IS NOT URBANISM. It's private road for rich people's cars. Nothing more. Our leaders should not be fooled by this snake oil.
5088 2018-12-18 16:51:51 Oil the guillotines
5089 2018-12-18 16:51:47 So I just bought castor oil, (coz if ur my friend ya know ya girl has shortage of kilay & pilikmata), effective kaya itu pampahaba daw?
5090 2018-12-18 16:51:47 #Oil prices fell on Tuesday, dropping for a third-consecutive session amid indications of swelling global inventories due to record U.S. and Russian output.
5091 2018-12-18 16:51:41 stop drilling for oil too

5093 2018-12-18 16:51:32 And since I spent enough money at Victoria’s Secret..I got a free bag with a charcoal face mask, a sponge, and this coconut oil body wash
5094 2018-12-18 16:51:20 儂もちょい買おうか悩んどるけど飽きそうw
5095 2018-12-18 16:51:10 Given Goldmans stock price I'm not sure they didn't buy oil
5096 2018-12-18 16:51:09 I hope that oil is a flame retardant...

5099 2018-12-18 16:50:58 What's wrong w/#OPEC+ is it empowers *plus* & a host of diplomats, reporters, etc might have some views on why empowering Russia/Putin is dangerous, only they're dead. But like the song from Cabaret: "maybe this time" it will be different. #SaudiArabia is about to find out? #oil
5100 2018-12-18 16:50:45 Our dear leading Quebec cardiologist just tweeted this morning that the general consensus (including from James Volek!) was that animal protein was not necessary in a low carb perspective and that we should replace butter with vegetable oil.
5101 2018-12-18 16:50:44 IF oil & gas is toast as you have said then how is it that the global demand is still rising and will for decades? 
It's toast because of NDP and Liberal policies to kill it. The US is booming as we are dying.
5102 2018-12-18 16:50:38 I filled the oil tank this week and got a full winters worth of dry logs under cover.  Reckon I should pick up a diesel generator?
5103 2018-12-18 16:50:24 Trump and friends are shorting oil & gas and overall markets.  Market manipulations must stop, screwing americans' pension fund.  High crimes!
5104 2018-12-18 16:50:23 This is how consultancies work. They take the latest ramblings of Ofsted and government regulations, interpret them, and offer schools a way forward. Ofsted is the Mystic Meg and seller of snake oil...
5105 2018-12-18 16:50:17 Cannabis ... CBD .... oil or put a little weed in a pipe 1/2 hr before bed and you feel like your sleeping on a marshmallow lol and you will sleep like a log

5107 2018-12-18 16:50:08 #Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating the delivery of #Iranian crude oil to the state energy company ENAP as a possible source of the noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital treatment in August
5108 2018-12-18 16:50:04 Incorrect. European ministers have said it would be trivial. We have quality food, fisheries, oil, gas, renewable energy, tourism, Universities, etc. etc.

We won’t struggle.
5109 2018-12-18 16:50:04 Try using a steam inhaler with oblas oil. It is brilliant for clearing sinuses etc. Hope you get better soon
5110 2018-12-18 16:49:54 Oil!
5111 2018-12-18 16:49:44 Might be better than some others but, Mustard oil comes from seeds of the brassica family, the same family as rapeseed which is the partial source of canola oil so I'll pass.
5112 2018-12-18 16:49:43 "Pardon my French, but olive oil is the shit" @MarlainaSmiles
5113 2018-12-18 16:49:39 Is Goldman still telling its clients to buy oil
5114 2018-12-18 16:49:37 Define what is a 'normal refinery.' Normal is by definition, the Norm, what is commonly used. If a refinery was located at the end of a pipeline that carries Alberta Oil Sands oil, then that refinery would be designed specifically for that purpose. And that would then be Normal.
5115 2018-12-18 16:49:31 I hope they run another "Oil going to .19 cents" story like they did in 2016....
5116 2018-12-18 16:49:28 The U.S. has become the world's largest producer of oil at a record 11.7 million barrels per day, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.
5117 2018-12-18 16:49:28 Indica oil.
5118 2018-12-18 16:49:22 Watching @SohiAmarjeet on BNN now spouting his Jerry Butts approved talking points pretending he cares about oil field workers. 

Has there ever been a Minister more out of touch and clueless about his file? 

To quote @RosieBarton - "don't think so" #cdnpoli
5119 2018-12-18 16:49:10 Back in 2016 when $TCW fell below 50c I remember a few of their board members were picking up a few million shares each. Thats the kind of confidence/message we should be looking for from management of oil companies to know they're worth touching
5120 2018-12-18 16:49:05 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5121 2018-12-18 16:49:02 How much did the Oil Painting of The Donald cost, now hanging at his Golf Resort! What a charitable gift to himself!
5122 2018-12-18 16:48:59 Bill McKibben cites a figure stating if all the oil in the tar sands were burned it would be 4 times the amount necessary to raise the global temperature past 2 degrees C
5123 2018-12-18 16:48:54 Since when does 'energy' mean oil and gas. Shouldn't renewables get the same type of package?
5124 2018-12-18 16:48:53 Breaking: Canada's Minister of Natural Resources Amarjeet Sohi announces $1.6 billion in funding to support the oil and gas sector.
5125 2018-12-18 16:48:53 The latest from @ZiadMDaoud: 
* Saudi Arabia estimating oil will avg about $80 a barrel in 2019
* He estimates oil will need to trade above $95 a barrel for for KSA to balance its budget #OOTT 

(Meanwhile Qatar assumed $55 per barrel in its budget forecast released last week)
5126 2018-12-18 16:48:40 Does Trump have more influence over Saudi oil prices than the federal funds rate? #FederalReserve #Powell #EndTheFed
5127 2018-12-18 16:48:33 Oil

5129 2018-12-18 16:48:16 If only he understood that big fireball explosions are pretty the first time, but there are even more beautiful ways to show things being destroyed than a gallon of tiki torch oil wrapped in detonation cord.
5130 2018-12-18 16:48:08 Price of crude oil down to 47.5!!! Wow!

5133 2018-12-18 16:47:59 I  really think the people of lebanon will miss him deeply...
No mather who he was, what he did 
Whats happening is far worse than it was under gaddafi 
Hut hey at leary they did get 
Cheap oil, free education,sponsored  european education, helsing hand for newly weds and so on..
5134 2018-12-18 16:47:52 Well said. No matter what the Liberal government does, even when it supports the oil and gas industry, Albertans always find excuses to complain and yip and yap. In fact, don't expect me to go to Alberta to work any time soon, not until they get a @GreenPartyAB government.
5135 2018-12-18 16:47:31 Maybe he is hero to downtown Winnipeg?  How much of this money will be spent over the oil and gas fields of Western Canada - BC, AB, Sask and Man.  The effect will be negligible.
5136 2018-12-18 16:47:31 Always follow the money.

The media makes $0 from @Tesla because of $0 paid for advertising.

They make millions off of ICE manufacturers and oil companies in advertising revenue.

There is $0 incentive for them to report positive stories about @Tesla.

Hit pieces = ad revenue.
5137 2018-12-18 16:47:30 Foreign Oil Corp extracting oil in Alberta are hugly profitable, but receive huge welfare from Cdns, they rip off Alberta & Cda but constantly receive huge $$. They destroy our air, water, land & walk away with billions.  Disgusting decision while so many in poverty in Cda
5138 2018-12-18 16:47:30 Yes they can. They've got a trillion in the wealth fund and $1.5 trillion in Aramco plus a lot of other assets, both domestically and overseas. They can even remove the dollar peg and enjoy the benefits of a weak currency and a strong dollar like the Russians are doing with oil.
5139 2018-12-18 16:47:28 I Castro oil the fuck out of my hair lmao
5140 2018-12-18 16:47:25 Does anybody remember the drop in oil from $90 to $40 when literally NO ONE correctly forecasted it?  It was revision after revision just trailing the actual drop in prices.

5142 2018-12-18 16:47:20 Yes. prereferendum, the EU owned reality whatever happened. Post Brexit, Europhobes will own it. They could get lucky. The price of oil is down for more than a decade. It was high 2007-2014. EU got the blame.
5143 2018-12-18 16:47:18 Absolute bloodbath in oil..signs of an efficient market with no rampant speculation  #oott #oil
5144 2018-12-18 16:47:15 Se le quedo sin nafta al equipo este que juega con river. Duraron menos que el gas oil en mi peugeot!!
5145 2018-12-18 16:47:13 I don't think CBD will be involved with this motion. The farm bill protects hemp and CBD oil, it just needs to be signed by the president (I heard sometime this week), and it will become law 
5146 2018-12-18 16:47:10 It is fair to ask pointed questions. It's not fair to attack Beto for accepting money from oil companies while ignoring that Sanders accepts money from military contractors. Acknowledge those shortcomings across the board within the party.
5147 2018-12-18 16:47:10 Who gets that wretched oil painting.
5148 2018-12-18 16:47:04 I bought a block of parmesan for a present! And previous years I gifted the flavored olive oil & vinegar combos from Nuvo Oil. Heating up leftover ravioli with garlic flavored oil is amazing. And he's got a Meyer lemon that rocks, too.
5149 2018-12-18 16:46:52 Here are some federal loans to help oil producers not produce oil and get their product to the coast without using pipelines..is that what they're announcing?
5150 2018-12-18 16:46:42 oil
5151 2018-12-18 16:46:38 We can't get our oil to market because of political interference. You're one dimensional, corporate hating ideology is preventing you from understanding how regulatory policy affects industry. BTW, Canada's economy is hardly booming.
5152 2018-12-18 16:46:30 Oil going to collapse big time. All small rallies are going to be sold into. Crude bulls can go into hibernation!!
5153 2018-12-18 16:46:24 Need i say anymore! Brit/ usa invasion of IRAQ AND PRIOR COVERT ACTION HAS LED TO THE WEST GETTING THE OIL.WHILE THE REST OF THE NEEDY OF IRAQ CAN DIE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! JUST LIKE THE israeli regime is doing in PALESTINE!  ETHNIC CLEANSING IN ACTION! NOW AS  I WRITE .
5154 2018-12-18 16:46:18 That's my believe too
5155 2018-12-18 16:46:12 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
5156 2018-12-18 16:46:07 Are Americans catching up with the ugly, nude, corrupt & Anti-National activities of the Trump administration or are they still not able to make up their mind to throw out one of the lowest denominators ever to occupy white house

Oil prices seem to suggest Trump & Co panicking
5157 2018-12-18 16:46:06 Mazola Oil and cling film - it’s for a friend.
5158 2018-12-18 16:46:05 Update: I got a 15% off discount on my oil change bc I work next door lmao
5159 2018-12-18 16:46:04 Oh there is inflation. Just not in the metrics you and I see. Every single commodity out there from oil to cattle, to copper is down. the CRB INDEX is the bellweather for inflation. get oil right, you get inflation right. Oil is -36% since Oct. Both growth and inflation slowing.
5160 2018-12-18 16:46:01 Claiming the Alberta Oil Sands should be shut down on account of the efficiencies and environmental impacts caused by early, open pit production methods is akin to claiming that we should return to the abacus, using ENIAC as a proxy to judge all computers by.
#abpoli @jkenney
5161 2018-12-18 16:45:48 He must be worried about losing his "loyal" oil business friends,  just like losing his coal mining friends and auto workers.
5162 2018-12-18 16:45:46 Hi Brent, it looks like you may have captured an oil painting instead of a photo - the sunrise views on our vessels are simply breathtaking! Thank you for sharing with us. ^rz
5163 2018-12-18 16:45:26 mau extraordirany oil karena lagi butuh banget :( wml!!
5164 2018-12-18 16:45:12 Toffee fingers are my fav but sadly off the menu for palm oil and plastic reasons  I will live vicariously through imagining you eating it 
5165 2018-12-18 16:45:04 You are using exact language designed by Conservative propagandists. Ethical oil? Clean oil? Oil sands are heavy oil. They are higher GHG emitting. So, not clean. It requires much more energy to clean. But it is a viable product, and the one we need to sell. But not Brent crude
5166 2018-12-18 16:45:00 Kalau ga salah puasa skincare itu double cleansing+ moisturizer dan sunscreen. Ga make face oil, serum, eye cream, face cream dll gt
5167 2018-12-18 16:45:00 Someone just made +21.24% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 47.828 → 47.320 (20x leverage)  ~ GRANDIOSE $WTICO $USD
5168 2018-12-18 16:44:55 "Big labor" lmao are you actually comparing environmentalist and the LGBT community to oil lobbyists and the ilk? Come on. This is false equivalence to the max
5169 2018-12-18 16:44:54 "The phoniest and whitest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
5170 2018-12-18 16:44:37 Interesting that big US shale names are flat even with WTI down 5%+, yet leveraged and second tier names like $wll and $crc are down big. Same in Canada, the leveraged oil companies are down huge, while the Suncor's and CNQ's are flat. #oott
5171 2018-12-18 16:44:29 I understand how terrifying it must be for some that have worked for decades in the oil industry. They weathered the ups and downs of the market but the jobs always came back. The money always returned. The difference this time is those jobs aren’t coming back.
5172 2018-12-18 16:44:24 Bringing my car in at the exact mileage it needs an oil change
5173 2018-12-18 16:44:19 I think you mean currently destroying the oil industry. Not that I think you believe her grandstanding bullshit right now
5174 2018-12-18 16:44:03 Actually oil.very long term chart is ultra bearish with target somewhere in 20 -30 range
5175 2018-12-18 16:43:56 Teatree oil is good too. 
5176 2018-12-18 16:43:56 Handouts for oil and gas, but regular people get taxes?
5177 2018-12-18 16:43:40 They were my best shops when I was in the UK , and Aldi sells such a nice coconut oil
5178 2018-12-18 16:43:34 With the oil prices still rocketed, 
5179 2018-12-18 16:43:31 Thread (1/13): Canada’s energy sector, including Alberta’s oil and gas industry, is a source of well-paying middle class jobs for Canadians from coast-to-coast-to-coast. Every community and every province has benefited from this prosperity, and we need that to continue. #cdnpoli
5180 2018-12-18 16:43:31 maybe it was even the car that pour the oil on them we dont know ...
5181 2018-12-18 16:43:07 Don't forget shutting down nuclear plants. Something @BernieSanders pushed in his home state. Guess what they had to burn oil to keep the lights on.
5182 2018-12-18 16:43:03 Oil is a more of supply and demand story....
5183 2018-12-18 16:42:57 And why is OPEC+ a bad thing? Truth is there's NOTHING they can do to increase oil prices right now (short of starting a war with Iraq). Slashing the budget would cause worse recession, so they deficit spend for awhile until prices rise.
5184 2018-12-18 16:42:57 And that's how the recent oil spill happened.
5185 2018-12-18 16:42:50 On Guard, Every Day, In Every Way! Keep some on you at all times and share with strangers when the opportunity shows itself... this oil can come in real handy this time of year! :)
5186 2018-12-18 16:42:50 Give me some Tiwa Savage's Lova Lova music anyday. 

If i break your heart na oil spillage
5187 2018-12-18 16:42:50  agree. What’s different about oil price decline <50 this time vs. last, shale plays won’t be able to raise low cost of capital to keep drilling this time. Junk bonds are about to hit a iceberg
5188 2018-12-18 16:42:45 Downside Volatility Trigger Crude Oil $CL at 10:41 @ 48.79
5189 2018-12-18 16:42:39 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Time to move the  Snake oil business to a new and more naïve region. Try Russia it seems they really like you...
5190 2018-12-18 16:42:38 Preguntele si ella sabe donde irán los desechos de esas plantas y que si por casualidad ha visto alguna vez el Fuel oil.
5191 2018-12-18 16:42:34 Supply side shock: When all geopolitical noise  is controlled , the only coherent music that oil prices continue to dance to, is that of the frackers. Cheap oil is here to stay. Angola, Nigeria etc fasten your fiscal belts for 2019.
5192 2018-12-18 16:42:32 The concerns are related to Peak oil theory I assume. In which case 3 years is too less a time frame to study. Also a wasn’t it at $80 last year? No worries if they are burning cash to diversify but again if they’ve got the reserves, all is good. 
5193 2018-12-18 16:42:27 The previous government did not give subsidy on those oils. The price of oil and the taxes or charges which were on it were kept safe with the Indian companies. Which the Indian government has paid after the sanctions ended in 2016. (2/2)
5194 2018-12-18 16:42:25 From the proverbial only in UK file. Shocking decision. Big oil have alot of friend sin the Tories.
5195 2018-12-18 16:42:22 Oil dey my head....
5196 2018-12-18 16:42:21 Lemon Zest Essential Oil
5197 2018-12-18 16:42:18 And HRC losing TWICE makes her?????????? Oh wait... a victim. Is that the snake oil your selling?
5198 2018-12-18 16:42:15 Quebec buys from Irving in NB. Irving’s refining is about 1/3 Saudi oil. Buying refined Saudi oil from a different province instead of directly importing crude doesn’t make it any less Saudi oil
5199 2018-12-18 16:42:13 What about pure mustard oil ??
5200 2018-12-18 16:42:00 So maybe then we need RESPONSIBLE companies to work the oil sands but since they never seem to be willing to accept responsibly and clean up on their own mess maybe then we wouldn't need to MAKE THEM.
5201 2018-12-18 16:42:00 The US had imposed sanctions on Iran in 2011. After that India continued to buy oil from Iran, but due to the channel shutdown they could not pay money in the dollars .(1/2)
5202 2018-12-18 16:41:56 $CL_F Does a dovish #FED reverse the strong $DXY and Oil unwind? CoT has crowded $DXY.  $SPX $DIA $QQQ
5203 2018-12-18 16:41:44 i’m too anxious to get my oil changed and my parents won’t take my car for me so i guess i’m just gonna let melvin die
5204 2018-12-18 16:41:39 Also dangerous for one-crop economy if its population has doubled in less than 30 years & it *still* burns its crop to make #electricity, especially in summer, even as global #Arab population stirs as it realizes a few families have squandered 40 yrs of region's #oil revenues
5205 2018-12-18 16:41:36 Its a repeat of early 2016, below USD40 shale producers will start shutting down.

Likely a bottom in WTI will occur in the $30s, worth going long below $40 on a risk reward basis.

Oil attracted a lot of speculative longs who are being liquidated, hence the overreaction on price
5206 2018-12-18 16:41:28 Try some CBD oil...
5207 2018-12-18 16:41:23 Everyone is selling oil...

5210 2018-12-18 16:41:03 In case anyone cares to listen in Nigeria, crude oil is selling below $48 per barrel as at today

We are in dec 2018 and we still have a mono economy solely dependent on oil

To those that support mediocrity keep it up

For those who know we can do better, vote apc out in 2019!
5211 2018-12-18 16:41:00 Some serious mixed messaging going on from the market today but I would note that oil, copper, gold and HY spreads are NOT confirming an extremely dovish Fed as many are claiming... Furthermore - back end of yld curve becoming compressed which also does not fit with dovish msg
5212 2018-12-18 16:40:54 Any moment crude oil will be below $47
Saudi's must be worried and investors in oil stocks.
5213 2018-12-18 16:40:51 I have patience, I just lose them when I’m waiting for an oil change
5214 2018-12-18 16:40:39 Yes treetree oil would be fine
5215 2018-12-18 16:40:37 Snake oil has a limited market
5216 2018-12-18 16:40:24 How about they run a national pipeline from coast to coast!!! Make Canada dependent on its own oil rather than supporting the Saudi”slaughter”regime

5218 2018-12-18 16:40:18 Are climate deniers really evil, science haters, who love oil and are a threat to the greater good?

Of course not: some of them only love coal -

It's a concept that solves no problems.

Trump just made it boils over and the oil guys started jerking it when Trump elected.
5234 2018-12-18 16:38:49 Oil getting pummeled down to $47, limbo time, how low can we go.

5236 2018-12-18 16:38:43 The die was cast, but I think about if the ECB + Fed had engaged in coordinated easing in late 07/early 08, maybe you wouldn't have had the blow off top in oil as USD got rocked, crushing consumers. And obviously an easier global stance into the downturn would've helped somewhat.
5237 2018-12-18 16:38:36 Gas and oil companies use the drug war to hurt our people then abuse us using jails to keep a sick government whom is ignorant and dysfunctional.

5253 2018-12-18 16:37:08 Lower oil prices & lower Sterling & low interest rates buffered the #economy without a deal there will be a further drop in sterling & to safeguard interest rates will go up. Hence, need tax breaks to cushion  especially as it comes amid global growth slowdown #TuesdayThoughts
5254 2018-12-18 16:37:04 Would it not be cheaper to increase oil production and limit oil imports
5255 2018-12-18 16:36:59 Soon to be another Russian satellite country....with lots of oil.
5256 2018-12-18 16:36:54 While General Park Chung Hee set S.Korea on the path of export-led industrialisation despite his dictatorial proclivity frm 1960. We were staggering from one crisis to anothr with leaders who had eyes only for oil dollars. We were not even sure if the entity Nigeria would survive
5257 2018-12-18 16:36:40 But won't a crash in shale/tar sands production eventually cause a rebound in the price of conventional oil?
5258 2018-12-18 16:36:39 You couldn’t think of any pressing issues. Like oil price discounts, like deficit spending or the immigration pact. The cost to Canadians on illegal border crossers.
5259 2018-12-18 16:36:36 From Holiness, the perfection of all called the highly sublime, flows anointing oil from which flow streams and fountains when blessed is called the Spirit of the Holiness. When the secrets stir from her, she is called “the holy tongue.” It awakens the sublime holy beings.

5264 2018-12-18 16:36:23 Ugh! I think I’m on the tail end of that madness. Get some eucalyptus oil and drip some into the back of your tub when you shower- steam it up and get that stuff out! And you can’t drink enough water. For reals! You’ll be better soon! Xo

5271 2018-12-18 16:35:42 There we go...Total get me out of here trade....It looks like we misjudged the fear over US shale oil.
5272 2018-12-18 16:35:41 Something to think about... between car Insurance, oil changes, gas, maintenance, car washes  why on earth do we take better care of and spend more money on our cars than we do our bodies?  

Health is an investment not an expense!
5273 2018-12-18 16:35:35 Checking the oil periodically is a good practice in an maintenance routine.
5274 2018-12-18 16:35:31 That’s the key for me as well! Some kids don’t respond to that shit! If my child misbehaved and volunteer to go get his own belt for me to whip him, I gotta come at the motherfucker differently! Obviously he ain’t phased by that shit  where is my prayer shawl and oil
5275 2018-12-18 16:35:29 sources say that humans have found an alternative to oil
5276 2018-12-18 16:35:20 get yourself to the @originalalternative in North Plantation and buy some CBD Oil
5277 2018-12-18 16:35:16 Many restaurants recycle the fried oil as well. So it’s just a no fam.
5278 2018-12-18 16:35:13 Crude Oil continues to make lower lows. Remains a caution sign for me $USO $CL_F $SPX
5279 2018-12-18 16:35:12 This is much more a demand story than a supply story.  Look at copper.  Trades tick for tick with oil as are all the industrial base metals.
5280 2018-12-18 16:35:06 CBD oil! I’ve never tried the syrup.
5281 2018-12-18 16:34:51 Yes, yes, of course. And the multiple growth of traffic quite coincidentally coincided with the capture of Deiri oil by SDF, and demand at local filling stations suddenly increased for the same amount. Well, we know that Idlib/ES economy has been flourishing there for many years.

5285 2018-12-18 16:34:34 I’m not saying that adding it is going to subvert loss, but based on my education and little bit of experience (I’m of course still learning) I think that oil and energy sectors are setting up for a bullish run in 2019
5286 2018-12-18 16:34:26 Many #shale producers in trouble with the oil price of today, bankrupty will take some.
5287 2018-12-18 16:34:24 This is weird but, I wash my face with baby wash, “tone” with hydrogen peroxide diluted with water, moisturise with aveno. Exfoliate with an electric brush and use vitamin E oil every other night (I’m trying to find a non abrasive exfoliator).

5308 2018-12-18 16:33:05 He's getting also the shale industry risk of downturn / collapse, I suppose.But I got the idea to save it already: ban oil imports, rebuild refineries -> more jobs, shale saved.
More debt and higher oil/gasoline price are irrelevant.

5311 2018-12-18 16:32:46 Awkward fact Bruce- according to the NEB Canada imports about 80k barrels per day of Saudi oil (‘17). Approx value? $2 billion.  My tweet did not mention Quebec.

5318 2018-12-18 16:32:12 Fried foods are not the business. Frying oil and then eating it causes so much lymph congestion, which will cause more congestion and now the body can no longer break down the fat and eliminate.

You don’t want to overheat oils which create transfat.

5321 2018-12-18 16:31:40 For Saudi Arabia to achieve its 2019-21 revenue forecasts, it will require a Brent crude price of $69-74 and daily oil production of about 10.5 million barrels, ADCB estimates. #oil 58 and falling! #ouch $wti $bno #oott
5322 2018-12-18 16:31:39 Oil and gas is down & too much foreign workers, start deporting foreign workers.   No jobs everywhere, your country allowed foreign nonprofit to screw with your industries.

5326 2018-12-18 16:31:11 A Canadian company did a bunch of ballistic imaging for them. They normally work for oil and gas and seemed legit. Can't remember the name of the company: I was too busy scoffing.
5327 2018-12-18 16:31:10 Sweet... cant wait to only pay $3 for gas again with oil at 0
5328 2018-12-18 16:31:07 Isn’t this the same oil patch that the Liberals glommed $13 Billion out of to give to Quebec?
5329 2018-12-18 16:31:04 A few perception busters:
Iranian Marxist leaders are considered national heroes by the Islamic Republic.
Automobile industry makes up 10% of Iranian GDP. 
In this year's govt budget the total oil revenue is 27%.
Iran's most expensive export is caviar not saffron.
5330 2018-12-18 16:30:59 Oil is getting slammed today.
5331 2018-12-18 16:30:58 Really? That was my point of concern  Yes I want it mainly for my acne so may be I can get the oil but where can I find black lotus? I think I need a new wash because my face no longer responds to mine 
5332 2018-12-18 16:30:55 #SaudiArabia  plans to increase state spending by more than 7% in an effort to spur economic growth. This Budget (will be in deficit by $35 B) implies oil at $80 per barrel. The Govt needs $95 to breakeven in order to avoid above deficit 

Current oil price though is < $50
5333 2018-12-18 16:30:43 Oil money fuck up a 100 Mill that’s just a yacht and a crib niggas dying to live
5334 2018-12-18 16:30:38 It just says "Wonder Oil". No brand name. I think it's Holland and Baretts own product.
5335 2018-12-18 16:30:37 There is a far greater response developing alt energy for the people by the people....don't be a sellout patsy oil whore to Canadians for an corpocracy of international banking and business conglomerates.
5336 2018-12-18 16:30:36 @JustinTrudeau, islam @liberal_party, @CTVNews, @CBCAlerts, the oil patch workers are proud of their work - they are not looking for a bailout like welfare rich @Bombardier. We are real Canadians who work real jobs. We pay the taxes that you so carelessly give to terrorists!
5337 2018-12-18 16:30:34 Here in a little bit, I’ll be taking a welding test for Chesapeake Energy. One of the biggest oil Companies in the world.

5342 2018-12-18 16:30:18 Hey #Canada who thinks #BCpoli should hold a #Referendum on twin of the existing #Burnaby pipeline?   #ABpoli just wants to move oil and support their and our nat'l economy.  Let ALL #BCresidents speak their voice on that specific pipeline twinning project.  Done.

5346 2018-12-18 16:30:03 Absolutely, setting up nicely though. From a macroeconomic perspective though, oil is pretty important to some of the worlds largest/fasting growing markets. Russian markets are down, largely due to oil/gas. RUB/USD down too, oil is one of Russia’s largest exports

Sadly, you're getting lower equity prices along with it, bud.
5354 2018-12-18 16:29:32 It’s a comprehensive multi-lateral deal wherein Kim Jong-Un agrees to develop nuclear weapons more quietly, China agrees to buy Palestinian olive oil, and Israel agrees to stay its pretty self and apologizes in advance for any children it must bomb on beaches.
5355 2018-12-18 16:29:32 @listmurkowski - so you're OK w/ oil prospectors seismic testing in 90,000-pound thumper trucks driving over a fragile tundra, sending up to 62,000 pounds of peak force into the ground in HOPES of finding an oil deposit??? #KeepItInTheGround Choose #renewableenergy

5358 2018-12-18 16:29:20 They just have a common enemy, that's all. A Friendship courtesy to brain-dead democrats who decided to poke the Russians in Ukraine...for the Russians it is diversification of oil revenues; for China critical energy security...since their naval supply routes are controlled by US
5359 2018-12-18 16:29:13 so this government is willing to kill more Canadian jobs by cancelling the Saudi arms deal, but is still  going to allow Saudi oil into Canada and exempt Saudi oil from Carbon Tax  while still imposing it on Canadian oil ! What a F**KING A**HOLE and so are his butt kissers !!!

5364 2018-12-18 16:28:37 What rivers, bayelsa & other oil rich states with 13% derivation funds do with their huge accrual from FG? No security equipment to complement police, no infrastructure upgrade, no good social services. Lagos is worse but at least, its complementing security e.g RRS & others.
5365 2018-12-18 16:28:34 Rumors are Mike bought something such as THC oil and/or some variations of that
5366 2018-12-18 16:28:30 Are you suggesting oil companies aren't funded by foreign investors? You obviously have an incentive for supporting oil?
5367 2018-12-18 16:28:27 But he was THE starter. The only reason the other guy saw the net was because Talbot had the blip for those few weeks and considering he was coming from the Rangers to Edmonton, it wasn't a complete surprise. There was always going to be a steep learning curve :)

5373 2018-12-18 16:27:56 What is your answer? How will the tailings ponds be dealt with? Shutting down every oil sands installation does not resolve the issue, but removes any income that might help resolve this problem. Industry will resolve this issue, but only if there is money to pay for research.

5375 2018-12-18 16:27:41 i wonder if for the purpose of manipulating a low volume mkt into year end it wouldn't be easier to just trash oil, likely easier, before scooping some spooz for 19. they did that last year
5376 2018-12-18 16:27:38 They came for coal, and you said nothing. They came for oil, and now you chirp. Get lost.
5377 2018-12-18 16:27:36 Oh my god. This is so sad. I read cannabis oil stops siezures. Wonder if they prescribe it in the US. They do now in the UK for seizures.
5378 2018-12-18 16:27:31 Could oil be breaking down from triangle to 45.10 or lower?

you can crochet handkerchiefs!     These handkerchiefs will be prayed over like prayer shawls with anointing oil blend I make... and we can get these out as well.  

Who's in??????
5411 2018-12-18 16:25:21 So, the indexes are green but:  oil crashing, 10 yields down hard and the VIX is higher.

Not good.
5412 2018-12-18 16:25:21 So Senator pass a law that makes them pay for it. It is all in your control. Tax the money transfers leaving the country or tax the oil and other goods entering the country. Either would easily pay for the wall.
5413 2018-12-18 16:25:17 Alberta acts like the middle child in a large family. They act, incorrectly, like the older & younger children are treated better & loved more. AB SHOULD have PST which helps fund programs and infrastructure. Relying on oil revenues is what caused any financial problems.
5414 2018-12-18 16:25:14 Saudis will pay dearly for colluding with Trump to bring oil price down but got double-crossed by Trump.
5415 2018-12-18 16:25:14 When ordering CBD OIL make sure the products are THC FREE, I've had people tell me they ordered from a company and the label didn't mention the ingredients.. Smh 
CTFO has labels on every product before ordering you can look at them right in my website to know what you ordered
5416 2018-12-18 16:25:07 I know you meant this as a joke and sorry to take such a serious turn but do you know who’s really happy? The troops in the us army who have been fighting a war for oil over the past 17 years.
5417 2018-12-18 16:25:04 Take some gold old fashioned Alberta ingenuity and elbow grease. We will survive, even if the end of oil is beginning.

5425 2018-12-18 16:24:46 @JustinTrudeau just isn’t listening. Alberta doesn’t want handouts. Or a gov owned pipeline. Just access to tidewater to export oil.

I think his motivation is so during the election he can say to the ROC, “We wrote cheque’s in Alberta, ignore their whining.”
5426 2018-12-18 16:24:45 It is shocking how @CanadaAction avoids addressing the real cause of the problem:
systematic premeditated subversion of Canadian oil sector by Trudeau government. Sidestepping the TRUTH can't bring a solution. Ever.

5431 2018-12-18 16:23:55 Brent crude oil spot prices averaged $65 per barrel (b) in November, down $16/b from October, the largest monthly average price decline since December 2014.

5457 2018-12-18 16:21:54 It was a tweet, not a PhD dissertation. 
the long form is, the Alberta Oil Sands's effect on humanity and the environment is no more, and perhaps far less harmful than other sources of oil. It is never a question of yes or no, but a question of how, and what are the alternatives.
5458 2018-12-18 16:21:50 Build the damn pipeline that we paid Billions of dollars for! Oil workers don't want EI, they want to work.

5462 2018-12-18 16:21:29 Equities were looking hopeful of a fed pause this morning, until the oil/equity negative loop spiral kicked in.  oil lower pulls equities lower, then equities lower pushes oil lower...
5463 2018-12-18 16:21:27 There goes oil....Looks like it wants to see 40 before the companies have a chance to react.
5464 2018-12-18 16:21:23 They aren’t support packages they are get out of oil incentives. Invest in green get educated in new technology.   They want the oil industry out of oil.

5510 2018-12-18 16:18:47 Oil is literally going to zero. Congrats @elonmusk. I hope you are happy.
5511 2018-12-18 16:18:36 But they did build four other pipelines, unlike Trudeau shutting down our pipelines while supporting Saudi oil
5512 2018-12-18 16:18:34 Crudely blues; no clear signs yet that  oil market is tightening, even after OPEC and major partners like Russia struck a deal earlier this month to curb output.
5513 2018-12-18 16:18:30 Liberals are a joke, talk of recession and they are throwing money around like there won’t be a tomorrow, then again. If a pipeline was in the ground and getting oil to tidewater the 1.6 is just a drop in the bucket. Can we say thanks but no thanks.

5520 2018-12-18 16:17:29 Why what has has he done. 
He spent 40 yrs raping Alberta of resources failing to diversify their economy. Oh wait that was Conservatives.
He’s running a 55 billion deficit oh wait that was Harper. 
He spent ten years failing to get oil to new markets oh wait Harper again
5521 2018-12-18 16:17:29 He's still a oil hungry war criminal to me, don't worry

5542 2018-12-18 16:16:15 Yeah, then fired him. Don’t think Trump has good standing with US oil industry right now.
5543 2018-12-18 16:16:15 Why do people actually think we're running out of oil, coal and other fossil fuels?

5548 2018-12-18 16:15:45 It's not 98%.  It's 100%.  Yea.  OK.  But they still support this snake oil salesman.

5553 2018-12-18 16:15:23 The bad economic decisions of the past administration is to blame. This admin inherited a dwindling GDP economy with no savings during rainy days and low revenue earnings from crash in global oil prices. That led us to stagflation(recession, rising unemployment & high inflation)

5557 2018-12-18 16:15:00 why dont you go drink a gallon of oil you grease monkey
5558 2018-12-18 16:14:58 I don't think "paid for protestors"is accurate or wise. There are plenty of sincere environmental activists who actually believe stopping the oil industry now, is a realistic approach. I don't! "Paid for protestors" reeks of bias and saying it is counterproductive! #ClimateChange

5561 2018-12-18 16:14:47 Boycotting palm oil is not the way. After 2020, what are you going to use to substitute palm oil? That will create a devastating effect worse than palm oil. Choose and support sustainable palm oil.
5562 2018-12-18 16:14:45 Oil down to $48 a barrel.
Thanks Khashoggi!
5563 2018-12-18 16:14:44 Because they are NOT losing their jobs to people with no legal rights to be here. If someone has no legal right to be here they are not simply walking in and stealing jobs. They lose them because the oil companies lay them off due to low prices. Period.
5564 2018-12-18 16:14:31 For a new cooking oil perhaps.

5570 2018-12-18 16:14:19 Greenspan should tell us something we don't know. The highs are in and the markets are headed lower. Oil headed to the high 30's, Dollar headed to par. Santa is bringing coal this year markets are breaking down. Vicious rallies should be sold. This is going to get ugly @Varneyco

5573 2018-12-18 16:14:05 I don’t doubt it. I, however, have a tiny feeling this is gonna create some blowback from the oil lobbyists in DC - maybe this is misplaced but just a feeling. He did say in his campaign he was gonna help the oil & gas industry - even hired an oil CEO as his Secretary of State.
5574 2018-12-18 16:14:02 My mom anointed my house with oil to protect it from demons. We used to get oil anointing at my church to protect us from demons.

5578 2018-12-18 16:13:34 I’m happy to report that the steaks were cooked perfectly. They were marinated in olive oil, red wine vinegar, and garlic so the marks were caused from initial grill flair up. Plus, the picture quality is horrible. Be assured that I would never overcook steak.

I have it almost every night w/o the coconut sugar

5594 2018-12-18 16:12:25 @yogrishiramdev sir u r talking about  inflation black money petrol diesel price rises interestingly ur till oil is rs 290 last month it was 190 directly hike of rs 100 really pathetic
5595 2018-12-18 16:12:25 Add in oil/gas and banking, and you get what we have now (and have had for decades): Neo-fascism.
5596 2018-12-18 16:12:20 Instead of promising money we don't have to help the oil patch just cancel #BillC69 and #BillC48. This will cost nothing and produce more than the 1.6 billion of additional debt the Trudeau's plan will create.

5600 2018-12-18 16:12:07 Cool old story (15/10/18). Saudi Energy Minister aka Oil Minister tells gathering sponsored by Indian Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas what they want to hear. He was cheered on by the heads of BP and Total.
5601 2018-12-18 16:12:05 With barytes. Blues. Prussian blue added to white lead with boiled oil is pure or not.
5602 2018-12-18 16:12:03 You're right though. Trump has never given a shit about the affiliation of those he scams. Tenants, contractors, voters et al. The idea that anyone buys his snake oil and thinks, "nah, he wouldn't do that to me" is equally hilarious
5603 2018-12-18 16:11:54 I hear you, but oil production is still forecasted to increase YoY by 1MMb/d
5604 2018-12-18 16:11:51 Aye, so does my sunderland Bro in law. could not hjave seen a man so determined during Indy ref ro get us the feck out. Having Murphy as his MP helped! This is a man who builds & designs oil rigs all over the world & knew we were getting shafted 30 yr ago!
5605 2018-12-18 16:11:48 I know of some Americans who use this as pain relief

What is more, they say you consume it to have enlightenment through better meditation
They also consume ayahuasca as alternative medicine 
5606 2018-12-18 16:11:44 #BREAKING: Federal funding package for oil patch to total $1.65 billion, mostly in loans
5607 2018-12-18 16:11:37 The only reason they are increasing the interest rate is to add value to the US dollar. It's all false and can't last forever. It's printed paper and when it's not used as much for buying oil, etc it becomes worthless. Hyper inflation
5608 2018-12-18 16:11:36 Coconut oil and thick lotions after a shower is THE BEST 
5609 2018-12-18 16:11:36 Historically, no. The US shale oil phenomena does not need higher oil prices as much as it needs cheap capital to borrow. "If you print it, they will come."
5610 2018-12-18 16:11:36 You can get cartridges with oil that have thc in them
5611 2018-12-18 16:11:34 My favorite part of my face routine is cleansing oil
5612 2018-12-18 16:11:34 Oil is at the lows for the year. Has anyone checked airfare lately? I thought prices go up when oil is expensive. Never come down though.

5614 2018-12-18 16:11:17 Irrelevant. He's talking about Canada not Quebec. Canada buys Saudi Arabian oil.
5615 2018-12-18 16:11:09 Saudi could raise money through bonds or use the cash from their wealth funds. They don't "need" a higher oil price. They can run deficits for several years without any problems.

There’s no evidence, the same as any snake oil.
Homeopathy is the opposite of science - believing in something despite there being no evidence to support it, and an overwhelming amount of evidence against it.

5637 2018-12-18 16:09:20 The key word is “forcibly” - that’s how these changes occur. Alberta and Saskatchewan were never going to do what Hamilton did while oil prices were soaring. Ideally they would, but it just doesn’t happen, no matter who is in power.
5638 2018-12-18 16:09:18 Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation is still going strong, doing good work around the world. The Trump Foundation simply misspent charitable dollars paying for oil paintings of you to hang in your country club.

5646 2018-12-18 16:08:31 You're awfully hung up on "if it isn't needed (to me) then it must be struck from the contract" which is not at all how contracts work. 

Again, talk a walk through an oil and gas lease with a good commentary, and realize the insanity of "of" vs "out of" and "at the well"

5707 2018-12-18 16:04:44 The fact is that we need to #keepitintheground, most of coal, oil and gas. And this means in practice rapid transition to 100% renewables. We have no time for false solutions. CCS in real life is used for enchanced oil recovery, that multiplies pollution. We don't need that.
5708 2018-12-18 16:04:41 $SPY Crude oil getting fucking destroyed, terrible indicator for markets.
5709 2018-12-18 16:04:35 @JoyVBehar Saudi Arabia -- it's not oil, it's weapons sales / contracts. This does have an affect on American workers, no matter how you feel about it.
5710 2018-12-18 16:04:29 Actually there is proof the oil industry is paying the greens. It's really easy to find the info.  Please keep a civil tone and state facts and think about this, if the science is settled why do we need more climate research? Seems like a total waste of tax money.

5715 2018-12-18 16:04:17 I promise you it had nothing to do with Obama... Trump is responsible for America being the main source of our fuel. I have seen it with my own eyes, Obama was outsourcing our oil that we used to other countries, Trump started using our own sources, Obama tried to shut down USA
5716 2018-12-18 16:04:17 Not necessarily. 

We have established companies that see the end of a business model that has made them billions.

They must make the painful transition to electric powered vehicles or die.

Wait until big oil decides electric vehicles are a threat. It will get uglier.
5717 2018-12-18 16:04:14 Dang, crude is taking a beating... again. Oil is soon to be free. 
5718 2018-12-18 16:04:11 I agree.  There has always been anti-scottish sentiment in the house.

5730 2018-12-18 16:03:19 $OIL anal-ysts on #CNBC used media's time to prop up $OIL  so that they can sell at a higher price to benefit their greedy self at the expense of small gamblers (investors). Huge glut of $WTI. US is producing more $WTI than Saudi and Russians.

5733 2018-12-18 16:03:06 I respectfully disagree. I remember gas lines when I was a kid, 1987, 2001, 2008, etc. The Cold War, Gulf Oil Crisis, Berlin Wall, Dotcom, 9/11, the Housing crash. At each milestone many were screaming the end is near. They were wrong.

5738 2018-12-18 16:02:50 This thing abt decide to do BTFD or STFR (US indexes)will haunt us for months as u hv a Potus who can “feel the market”well. As for WTO crude oil,i see some hope to get a bottom in January/Feb ,perhaps lower low,and bounce.The trendline is cleaner

5740 2018-12-18 16:02:48 Stop lying Rachel, Alberta workers, especially those in oil & gas & power generation know clearly that you hate our jobs & NDP leftists are certain Alberta can run on windmills & pixie dust.

5742 2018-12-18 16:02:40 Whistler has benefitted economically from the oil and gas industry. Heck, their customers come from industries around the world... including firearms, drugs, dictators, organized crime...
Maybe they should be paying fines for profiting off those industries.
5743 2018-12-18 16:02:27 Hmm. Seems you don't get what is happening. Alberta is bust because of NDP/lib foolishness.
Oil industry elsewhere doing just fine.

5763 2018-12-18 16:01:14 Most probably Trump was downplaying oil as a reason because of the MBS debacle, but clearly Israel is a driving reason for the US presence in the Middle East, according to the President - also the main reason for fighting Iran.
5764 2018-12-18 16:01:04 I’m in the waiting room at the shop getting my oil changed and some nurse is in here too, violating HIPAA chatting with her homegirl about her patient they both know from high school.
5765 2018-12-18 16:01:00 It’s nice that they show me what they’re doin when I get an oil change, however, I have NO clue what I be lookin at. I just nod and say ok 
5766 2018-12-18 16:00:51 Commodity currencies getting whacked as #oil drops: USDCAD up to test test the 6th Dec highs, AUDUSD selling to fresh day's lows. GBP getting in on the act too with cable giving back more. Oil has lost a quick buck in the last few minutes. More squaring?
5767 2018-12-18 16:00:51 Our Liberal government has billions for the oil industry on very short notice, but can't find the will to spend money on a housing crisis that is having immediate and damaging effects on Canadians of all regions and backgrounds.

5771 2018-12-18 16:00:42 No of course not. The whole "solar panels not pipelines" is BS. We should be exporting a ton of oil. 

But I'm just saying, the industry fluctuates. The people who moved to Alberta to ride the wave should leave, just as easily as they came.
5772 2018-12-18 16:00:40 Actually, he is the one dictator who actually helped people. Oil was like grain. Not like Mugabe, who turned Zimb, once the richest country in Africa, to the poorest. Africa will never be the same without Gadaffi.

And given this 'research' provides a very useful distraction to funding and to workload issues in the UK, it matters here too.
5776 2018-12-18 16:00:31 Brent has huge support @ 55$

Will it get protected?

Also how long premium of 21/22% against WTI oil will sustain?

5828 2018-12-18 15:58:16 Eh, car and oil companies are hardly more virtuous, often lobbying against safety and environmental regulation. But people overlook that for whatever reason. Electric car = “saving the environment”. Electric scooter = “greedy tech bros”. See you on the 83, 28, DASH, 181, etc...
5829 2018-12-18 15:58:16 Read the story.  The handout is for across the country. “the new funding will be made available to oil and gas companies across the country”. The majority of the money will still stay in the eastern provinces.
5830 2018-12-18 15:58:15 so if you’re going to make a personal difference, it’s much more logical and much easier to choose plant based foods because they have the biggest impact, rather than trying to not use oil. It’s very feasible to get MOST people on earth to greatly reduce or eliminate animal prod
5831 2018-12-18 15:58:12 Not sure what being a medical doctor has to do with the fact you support a belief that the Earth was formed around 5k years ago but drive a car that uses products made from oil, which takes hundreds of thousands of years to be created.

It’s actually sad but they CHOSE to do it. They took a gamble that it would never change and they were wrong.

5849 2018-12-18 15:57:11 Reported that Saudi economist says they need $70 oil for their 2019 budget

2019 budget is a 7% increase.

2019 will mark 6th year of deficit spending for them. 
#OOTT
5850 2018-12-18 15:57:10 The flavor and high of oil is unmatched
5851 2018-12-18 15:57:07 There's also a national security angle. For example, IIRC Australia contracts out refining of its oil to Singapore because its own capability isn't "competitive" (not sure whether due to currency, labour costs or tech). 

Now it's put a sensitive industry outside its own control.
5852 2018-12-18 15:57:06 And that's just one problem with Christian doctrine... peddling the notion that we are inherently bad, and should be ashamed of who we are.

Christianity invents a disease (sin) and then promises a snake oil cure.
5853 2018-12-18 15:57:05 still seems low, but I don't think it really matters in terms of oil policy, etc. Saudi Arabia can afford to take on debt now. I don't see a serious imperative to balance the budget, esp when there isn't anything they can do to get oil to $70 (short of starting a war with Iraq)
5854 2018-12-18 15:57:04 The oil and gas sector isn't going to be getting better. How about you try to put initiatives in place to move towards getting off fossil fuels and on to renewable energy? That's where the jobs are.

5878 2018-12-18 15:55:29 When Tillerson's appointment was made public, Trump had yet to meet him face to face.
If you track that, it leads to an oil triangle w/ Trump, Russia and either Exxon or Rex.
No way does anyone not think Putin placed Tillerson.

5881 2018-12-18 15:55:09 I went and had my oil changed this morning at the Battlefield road location. online booking my oil change was fast and easy. the guys at the shop were very friendly and fast! I highly recommend them to anyone (ladie's day is Tuesday for oil changes!!) check them out!
5882 2018-12-18 15:55:08 Disappointed I have a child with autism and I would give my son CBD oil there are a lot of benefits and studies that show it has made improvements to children with autism, if you prohibit it will not stop it, its best to think of the benefits of making it legal in Hamilton
5883 2018-12-18 15:55:04 Well, we've pretty much got things all figured out over here. The US government is a nothing if not a well-oiled machine. 

And by "well-oiled machine," of course I mean a rusted-out lawnmower engine soaked in motor oil and set ablaze
5884 2018-12-18 15:55:01 yeah well...you keep your enemies closer.

5899 2018-12-18 15:53:55 Energy Sector use this kind of manipulation to get citizens worried about our resources running out one day and having an over supply the next day. Just to drive the market to their favor for World Corporate Greed dictating the oil and gas prices.
5900 2018-12-18 15:53:52 You give them too much credit. And deflationary pressures go well beyond commodity cost declines - demographics, technology, supply side effects of tax reform (blasphemy, I know), and the lagged effects of the fed’s already executed rate increases. Lower oil is deflationary gravy
5901 2018-12-18 15:53:46 the kiehl's midnight recovery oil needs to be on my counter by 12/26, and i'd love to try a pcaskin kit. hopefully someone will replenish my favorite benton sheet masks, but that's it.

Why are you so eager to believe the oil companies, who's profit motive to lie is FAR greater than the scientific community's? Do you not get that oil is using the same misinformation strategy that Big Tobacco did?

5948 2018-12-18 15:49:40 Zinke and his deputy who will be acting Secretary when he’s gone are responsible for selling or leasing National Park  lands to be raped by oil and/or gas  interests.  This is totally counter to the mission of the Secretary.

5956 2018-12-18 15:49:15 You're incorrectly conflating crypto and fiat. Like gold or oil, crypto takes real effort to create new units. Fiat doesn't. The problem w fiat isn't that infinite competing fiats can (theoretically) happen. Rather, it's that more units (than are agreed upon) are created.

5977 2018-12-18 15:47:45 Has nothing to do with anything other than fundamental cost of production.  Oil is a fungible asset... the trouble with oil sands oil is it requires more energy to produce a barrel than conventional sources that is what makes the price difference.

6014 2018-12-18 15:44:22 Canadian here ....  our PM says he believes science yet he wants to pump 3 times the current oil output to the world in the name of $$$  - politics is a mystery at times
6015 2018-12-18 15:44:20 i just bought HL Hydrating Oil lagi 2 botol cause Hermo buat sale. from RM66 to RM16.50 hehehehehehehehehehehehe why not....
6016 2018-12-18 15:44:12 I'm not asking Harper to have made us a hi-tech, manufacturing power overnight. But I would have liked less emphasis on catering to oil, less cutting of research and development grants, no repudiation of science he disliked, openness to green tech. He had nearly 10 years.

6018 2018-12-18 15:44:09 Me and @Godshawk living together would end up with us both becoming eccentric artists. Our life will be documented in pale sepia tone film, punctuated by the blue hue of tobacco smoke... the scene littered with empty bottles of balsamic vinegar and oil we use to soak our bread.
6019 2018-12-18 15:44:03 I agree.  Cheering for lower oil is a bad thing and someone should tell Navarro/Trump.  A lot of the economy is driven by the industry, don't be a fool.
6020 2018-12-18 15:43:57 未来に絶望するオタクは俺だけでいいだろうが
6021 2018-12-18 15:43:56 i mean you should because you're going to develop a coronary disease but like in the immediate discussion olive oil is a healthier alternative to water + salt
6022 2018-12-18 15:43:55 yep...why they trade with MLP's I have no idea....perhaps it's that whole fuel substitute thing but oil is in the 48's this morning and every MLP on my list has gone negative....other than SUN.....
6023 2018-12-18 15:43:54 Indeed, my takeaway was that the issue was oversupply. Production doesn't adjust to demand, they just find more uses for the surplus produce.

My dad's always made this point about Oil refineries, which are essentially chemical feeders for downstream industries (e.g. plastics).
6024 2018-12-18 15:43:43 The only viable option that can replace coal, gas and oil is nuclear.  Perhaps Alberta needs to invest in nuclear reactors. Excess clean nuclear power can be used to further bring down the cost for AB and SK to extract oil and further reduce CO2 emissions.
6025 2018-12-18 15:43:42 $SPY holding but lack of committed buyers. Volume anemic. Slow fade. Lots of chop. Oil and Bios still weak. Fang showing strength.
6026 2018-12-18 15:43:38 Perhaps it doesn't fit within the narrative that is being pushed on Quebec as the anti-Canada racist that prefers Saudi oil for no good reason other than hating Canadian goodness.
6027 2018-12-18 15:43:35 we survived! Christine had a sleeping bag and I had extra blankets. oil came at 6:30 this morning! 
6028 2018-12-18 15:43:32 PRE ELECTION MATTERS: Oil plunges below $49 per barrel!

6032 2018-12-18 15:43:17 So, it's not so much that the US is in the ME BECAUSE Israel. We ignore Israel's settler colonialism BECAUSE they're useful thugs. Same goes for Saudis.

The US demands hegemonic control of the ME BECAUSE oil markets. Racism helps justify I'm sure.

6034 2018-12-18 15:42:55 An oil and gas company must demonstrate that they will be able to perform the work in a safe and environmentally responsible manner before any authorization would be provided by the CNSOPB, with specific consideration to proximity to the Sable Island National Park Reserve.  3/4
6035 2018-12-18 15:42:43 It's time for Shetland to become independent.

6038 2018-12-18 15:42:36 Do you know how much $ SA invests in Canada. In our Universities, infrastructure, so many sectors other than oil. 10% of oil consumption comes from there..not 50!

Like I said, this is the same thing the Bernie folks are doing to Beto, talking about the Oil money he got.  He represents a district in Texas last I checked
6044 2018-12-18 15:42:10 I concede, there are some incompetent Ministers in @narendramodi govt, but He can’t isolate them also, because of political compulsion. Now tell me in which sector this govt has not done well? Aviation? Road? Agriculture? IT? Manufacturing? Defence? Oil? Gas?

6050 2018-12-18 15:41:39 As has always been the case, Not(mypremier)ley and Trulander, and the real power behind them, never wanted to do anything for the oil and gas industry other than kill it.

6078 2018-12-18 15:40:05 The oil and gas industry looks cheap and profitable because it is heavily subsidized. We need to remove the subsidies and support green energy and green technology before it is too late. The jobs this will create will be far better than adding more retail jobs.

6112 2018-12-18 15:37:20 It's well written. I believe that Standard oil would have taken over entirely though. They were very close and even though they broke them up, some still came back to merge. When you own so much, you don't have to worry about price gauging though because you set the price.
6113 2018-12-18 15:37:16 Having said that the impact of lower oil prices will only be felt in 3-4 months.
6114 2018-12-18 15:37:11 Did you also get the Luna sleeping oil? I'm also contemplating this splurge right now. It's just so spendy!

6116 2018-12-18 15:37:04 The article fails to show both sides of the dispute. Bernie’s “journalists” conflate accepting money from individual employees in certain industries, like oil or banking, w/ corporations themselves. Beto’s average reported contribution from these individuals was $45 per person.
6117 2018-12-18 15:37:01 Lol! We started buying oil from S.A. 3 years ago? What about 10yrs of Harper? Did absolutely nothing for AB? Harper bought the same oil. Trudeau bought the pipeline for AB, where he had zero support, and cost him seats in BC.

6124 2018-12-18 15:36:37 People will keep on drilling but not as fast as with high prices. And then depletion starts to have an impact. If you go back to 2016 when prices were also low, US oil production decreased by almost 1m bpd. (I do not recall the exact figure).

6153 2018-12-18 15:34:51 However, the price of oil is indeed regulated based on the OPEC cartel, so there they can cut supply to increase the price if they so please. The discussed carbon tax would be more devastating for oil prices (like car gas), in my opinion, though.
6154 2018-12-18 15:34:50 Parked in the waiting room at my Chrysler dealership. Tires, brakes, alignment and oil change. Merry Christmas, ‘200.’
6155 2018-12-18 15:34:50 ... and although thanks to Australia I’m quiet certain that materiel problem have been solved everyone in that region still needs energy imports (especially oil) and more of that if they’re about to grow &/ develop.

6157 2018-12-18 15:34:45 @llevargnodnerb Thanks for liking. You love mayo.  Do you know how easy it is to make?  In a blender, four large egg yokes, a bit of salt and pepper, mix slowly.  Well combined, drizzle slowly in olive oil with a bit of vinegar or lemon juice. Done!
6158 2018-12-18 15:34:44  Gotta add a little bit of healthy into everything.  And hey, that fresh ginger minced in the blender makes for some great oil.
6159 2018-12-18 15:34:39 Ive only had oil so i guess thats what I prefer! Thx!
6160 2018-12-18 15:34:31 では私がお湯をいれておきますね
6161 2018-12-18 15:34:28 I live in an oil resort town, Andrews Texas, and it sounds like a Christmas Story about here.
6162 2018-12-18 15:34:20 I love Brooklyn. We sell black
Seed oil soaps, organic body wash, nuts, iPhones, iPhone cases, toothpaste, stamps and there’s a UPS  access point. I have everything I need!
6163 2018-12-18 15:34:12 71% of global emissions are caused by 100 companies, including the gas and oil companies that push climate change denial. The same companies that ask the government for billions of dollars to build sea walls to protect their refineries from rising sea levels.
6164 2018-12-18 15:34:08 This is the car the world needs right now. Can you pour crude oil directly into it? God bless you, Lincoln/FoMoCo.
6165 2018-12-18 15:34:08 The oil and gas industry successfully radicalized Alberta.

Booing Quebec while simultaneously co-opting a French protest.

6167 2018-12-18 15:34:00 Hmm, I've tried oil based before and wasn't as big of a fan. I guess I just need to try them more!

Thanks for the reply ^•^

6169 2018-12-18 15:33:43 We paid a dollar twenty a gallon with our savings for buying food at Kroger here in southeast Texas. It was $2.10 a gallon at buckees in Seguin texas. I'm sure the oil company's are hating this.
6170 2018-12-18 15:33:41 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?

6174 2018-12-18 15:33:24 Putin expressed a desire for the removal of non-oil-burning cars at the dinner with Jill.
6175 2018-12-18 15:33:19 Matt, how do you feel about the Singapore style of paying public officials very high levels of compensation? I'm coming around to it after reading that the guy administering the Iraq oil for food program at the UN sold out for a $160,000 bribe.
6176 2018-12-18 15:33:08 My first act of activism was being like 3 and boycotting baby oil after seeing that one episode of Tiny Toons Adventures

6178 2018-12-18 15:32:59 天才？
6179 2018-12-18 15:32:54 Still interesting how the oil price drop at the end of 2014 until 2016 was almost a mini-recession, and yet we rarely hear about it.
6180 2018-12-18 15:32:52 酔ってるから何でもおもしろい
6181 2018-12-18 15:32:45 You must compare the oil price in international markets of both years
6182 2018-12-18 15:32:43 Largest known oil reserves in western hemisphere.  No gasoline because .... government owned refineries are broken, and the government has not invested in repairs/ updates. Same with government owned power and communications. Yeah socialism ...
6183 2018-12-18 15:32:31 Oil sands, need's to be a CROWN CORPORATION, that's the only way , it's going to be developed to it's full potential. otherwise, it will be held , HOSTAGE by the price of oil.
6184 2018-12-18 15:32:31 The threat of losing oil trumps everything.
6185 2018-12-18 15:32:24 No, when they blame being laid off in the on immigrants instead of the simple fact of the oil business, I call them a racist (especially when job insecurity in oil is our history in AB). When they are on stolen land but want to deny migration of POC, I call them a racist.
6186 2018-12-18 15:32:23 A good leader for us how? When he was killing us, robbing our money, hanging uni students on live TV and getting his supporters to pull on their legs, imprisoning people who went to fajr prayer on suspicion of terrorism, or when he let an oil rich country’s people live in poverty

6191 2018-12-18 15:31:46 The engineers I know in the oil and gas industry got laid off 3 years ago but we’re back to work in 6 months or less and are now complaining that they can’t find enough people to come work. They’re making bank.
6192 2018-12-18 15:31:40 I dispute her assertion that meat and milk aren't, in fact, corn.
If M&M's are corn--and they definitely are--then so is meat. Just because the machines that convert the corn to edible product is made of meat instead of metal, it's still converted from corn stock. Which is oil.
6193 2018-12-18 15:31:38 So here ends the discussion already.
Since we seem to look at the same item and I say:
- it is round
In reply you say:
- no it's square

Without explaining why... Useless.

And XRP founders created its and just gave 80% away.. Makes sense. Sure.
Its like oil in the ground right?
6194 2018-12-18 15:31:36 There will be plenty reading your tweet thinking. I wonder if my car takes oil !
6195 2018-12-18 15:31:26 Ashanti be looking good asf all baby oil down and shit
6196 2018-12-18 15:31:26 @Amitttty  and what happens when players are crap & paid fortunes for being crap. When I am manager I'll turn them around :-)
6197 2018-12-18 15:31:26 By the value of the XRP itself going up. Related to the value of the ecosystem and the perceived value of the use of the token. What is oil worth? What is oil worth if you then have a multi-billion dollar auto industry around it? Same oil.
6198 2018-12-18 15:31:20 And the question is why is Canadian oil not as sought after as it should? You talk to different ppl you get different answers. I prefer an economist (hopefully more than one and w/ different explanations) to a politician if I want to listen.

6203 2018-12-18 15:30:59 I mean, holy cow, oil is at $48 ish and gas is at lows we haven’t seen for a while. You know me from previous tweets. I’m a conspiracy theorist and I have a hard time believing that the oil and gas companies don’t engage in some degree of price manipulation.

6214 2018-12-18 15:30:06 Some thoughts on #Saudi 2019 budget:
- largest ever with 7% increase in spending ($295 billion)
- According to @AlRajhiCapital need $68 per barrel oil to fully fund budget
- Likely budget deficit of 4.2% GDP
- $226/mo allowances for civ servants & military to cont
6215 2018-12-18 15:29:36 The barista's face fell as the customer barely glanced at the expertly drawn flower in her latte. When had coffee art become so commonplace, he wondered. Every cup was a masterpiece! He googled oil paints on his break.
6216 2018-12-18 15:29:33 pure ginger and lavender essential oils work for me. you can find car oil diffusers to use them in.
6217 2018-12-18 15:29:29 If crude oil is putting in a bottom, as we suspect, the stock market could be doing the same. Don't be a complacent bear...the trend is only you friend until it ends.
6218 2018-12-18 15:29:27 No boo. The bottle does not house the Holy Ghost, it houses the anointing oil.
6219 2018-12-18 15:29:25 It’s finished with a natural oil/wax sealer and a coat of polyurethane. My friend wanted the natural look.
6220 2018-12-18 15:29:18 Kenney & gang had 10 years to displace dictator oil (as he calls it). Maybe it did not occur to him to do something while he was part of a majority gov’t or, like usual, he conveniently forgets!??

6227 2018-12-18 15:28:45 Oil and water do not mix you can stir but they always separate, so it goes in this world people seeking good and peace and those seeking evil which brings no peace?
6228 2018-12-18 15:28:41 Just took 5 ml of Reign Drops from @BCCannabisStore maybe i will get a buzz this time. If i don't i am never buying mtc oil from them again. Supposed to be 29.2 % THC/ml I am thinking its not even close to that.
6229 2018-12-18 15:28:39 Yes, He is so merciful for preparing His Bride to walk in the Spirit! To have oil in their lamps in the time of great darkness that is hitting the earth and intensifying by the day!

Calum you do know Westminster gas taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and still near bankrupted the UK?
You do know this I take it?
6232 2018-12-18 15:28:09 He so much detest of Islam
6233 2018-12-18 15:28:02 Your generalization is incredibly ignorant and insensitive. If you were in fact educated you’d know Canada’s differential is caused by prov blocked trade. The US is doing the most oil production in 98 years. Alberta has the second most engineers per capita in NA. Many lost jobs
6234 2018-12-18 15:28:00 They can fight to the death with the oil rigs.
6235 2018-12-18 15:27:54 Oil price below 50 dollars. Surely, there is no way the naira will be able to withstand that blow. The current exchange rate is likely to get even worse

6240 2018-12-18 15:27:45 What kind of oil?
6241 2018-12-18 15:27:39 The worst thing that's ever happened to Saudi is, I believe, finding oil. A Saudi just stepped on my toe and for apology he offered a cup of coffee. Like how about NO?

6245 2018-12-18 15:27:08 It does! I love a lip oil
6246 2018-12-18 15:26:52 Startling figures on CNN: US oil output is currently 11.7m barrels, of which 8m are from shale. Makes it sound like fracking will take some stopping.
6247 2018-12-18 15:26:46 They just look more convenient than frying with oil
6248 2018-12-18 15:26:45 It’s just oil; your car won’t rust!

6251 2018-12-18 15:26:27 Brett there are plenty of Canadians that stand by the PM - Your Problem wasn’t caused by Trudeau he didn’t have a role in oil slump (Saudi & Russia did) nor can he be blamed 4 Supreme Court pipe decisions~Blaming shaming and complaining won’t fix things .Helpful advice might
6252 2018-12-18 15:26:24 It doesn't matter that he's leaving.  New boss is the same as the old boss, but actually worse - Bernhardt is lobbyist/lawyer for big oil, gas, and mining.

6257 2018-12-18 15:25:56 WTIC Charts looking weak. Can it go toward USD 40/35 ? Chance is there , but only after some upsides/ranging over next few weeks to catch further retail into making "value buys " in Oil stocks.
CRB Index should hold 183 and should not crack below,if it does that WTIC in trouble
6258 2018-12-18 15:25:50 They did , the industry changed after Trump increased oil production. New situation needs new ideas. Why didn’t John Chretien put pipelines in ? The past is gone and Harper isn’t the answer for every problem the Liberals have, they are at the helm.

6260 2018-12-18 15:25:45 I also wonder if using an oil with an actual flavour - e.g olive - would work better than sunflower (which I picked because of its lack of flavour).  Not a total write-off, but not my favourite vegan baking experiment.
6261 2018-12-18 15:25:44 uhh...no? i don't drink but i hope margaritas don't smell like wood? lol

plus, it smelling a little like alcohol means that...it probably isn't a lot of oil in it: can project pretty loud but it might not last long straight up

6265 2018-12-18 15:25:37 Cons were in power in Ab for 44 straight years. While up to their knees in oil, always mismanaging, insufficient, business-friendly royalties & just like GOP, always diverting, blaming others, selling out. Fortunately 2 major cities are modern thx to decades of progressive mayors
6266 2018-12-18 15:25:34 @jkenney @fordnation @PremierScottMoe Trudeau now bribing Albertans with $1.5 billion borrowed federal welfare cash just before election - after sabotaging oil pipelines - typical Communist "planned economy" plan that destroyed USSR China Korea Cuba - never worked - never will.

Oil and has would LOVE to be working parents again!
6270 2018-12-18 15:25:15 Ye. Burning the midnight oil fixing his mistakes
6271 2018-12-18 15:25:12 The government in power needs to grow a set and put the energy east pipeline through!  Harper for ten years and now Trudeau are screwing the country, especially Alberta, by not getting it done. We should have been completely independent of foreign oil years ago!
6272 2018-12-18 15:25:11 Well the original Energy East. was supposed to stop off in Montreal east, to bring ALBERTA oil to Ultramar, Ptrocan........etc......etc. Cheaper, more secure, and Canadian source
6273 2018-12-18 15:25:09 後半と二条さんが繋がってる……
守らなきゃ
6274 2018-12-18 15:24:59 for example, oil/fuel industries, mine industries, what if they have industrial secrets and the 'source' of the energy we use is different, and cheaper than what we are told? The #jetfuelhoax for example, the atmospheric eletricity hoax, if they retain that they would recreate it
6275 2018-12-18 15:24:56 My best recipe uses Cashews to replace egg in Caesar dressing. #MyPlantersWish #PlantersCanada

Cashew Caesar dressing
5  anchovy fillets
1/4 cup raw cashews
3 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1 tbsp. Dijon mustard
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic 
1/2 cup olive oil
salt
6276 2018-12-18 15:24:53 If that isn’t vote buying, I don’t know what is!! How’s that going to help Alberta get it’s oil to more lucrative markets?? Hopefully we don’t fall for the PM’s trick!!
6277 2018-12-18 15:24:47 ลองเปลี่ยนเป็น cooking coconut oil ดูต่า เขาเอากลิ่นออกแล้ว
6278 2018-12-18 15:24:40 I'd like to infuse 2 oz of grinded & decarbed Gorilla Glue with 8 oz of virgin coconut oil into suppositories, but don't want to waste the buds if it won't be strong enough to fight the cancer.......
6279 2018-12-18 15:24:37 That's what VENEZUELA has done and it was sabotaged for fighting for its citizens who never benefitted from their God given natural resources. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world but it only benefitted the few because of CAPITALISM.
6280 2018-12-18 15:24:33 That is BS! They are Albertans marching for pipelines and rightly so! Racists towards who/what? IT IS ABOUT SELLING OUR OIL, NOT ABOUT RACE! 1491, yeah, saw that documentary. People came to NA from Asia AND Siberia at different times, so who was really here first?

little did I know that I’d have a screw lodged into my tire and getting a new tire would be an all day excursion

6285 2018-12-18 15:24:01 I have no sympathy for people who make 200k a year, spend a 180k a year who are upset they have to pay more taxes and claiming immigration is making them loose jobs.

Blame the extremely rich oil companies you work for. Not the government.
6286 2018-12-18 15:24:00 I'm getting my oil changed and it's cold as balls outside.
6287 2018-12-18 15:24:00 I stg once I get some citric oil and a spray bottle, I'm spraying ALL the cords and plants, and then just letting the demonkitten free to raise her little hell in the other rooms.

Letting her run up/down the stairs might help widdle her destructive energy down a bit.

6290 2018-12-18 15:23:34 In life we think we are smarter than boiling sun, we think we can evaporate metal and bring tweet to our aide , naysayers are like keyamo, they sweep every atmosphere of twitter, believing in morning mare,life is not a top oil. yall think about it @josh2funny
6291 2018-12-18 15:23:27 i can see giving frug "users" a break. They're the casualties of the war on drugs which isn't really a war, it's a govt run business. If the U.S. wanted to get rid of drugs as much as they want strategic oil regions, cocaine would be $10k a gram.
6292 2018-12-18 15:23:26 Ask the milltary industrial complex to release the technology we know is out there then there is no need for oil and the 3rd world would become devloped overnight riseing humanity up not just albertians
6293 2018-12-18 15:23:24 i use weed coco oil to keep it slick
6294 2018-12-18 15:23:13 . @JustinTrudeau has about as much control over the price of oil as you do. Why aren’t you doing anything about that if he’s doing enough?

You could be talking about transitioning #alberta’s economy to clean energy to avoid boom/bust cycles, but no, #followingnotleading wins.
6295 2018-12-18 15:23:11 Thankful to God.

6296 2018-12-18 15:23:11 Well, 2 things I was expecting to see...oil now @ $48 bucks, & $XOM @ $73.  This is a great company at a great price.  To me it's reasonable to expect it to move higher over the next 6 months.  This is a great entry point & remember, successful investing is being patient & acting
6297 2018-12-18 15:23:10 My wife may or may not have made a similar mistake administering vitamin D drops to our baby girl when there were also oil of oregano drops at the table.
Same bottles, oil of oregano was fortified with vitamin D.

6301 2018-12-18 15:22:49 aku ga gitu problem oil, cuma kadang ketat banget muka kalau udah diset bedak, makanya mau coba ini biar ngelunakin(?)
6302 2018-12-18 15:22:47 Russian oil exports to China are soaring, US oil exports at zero. MRGA!
6303 2018-12-18 15:22:30 I just think you overestimate any government’s ability to restructure an economy in the face of market forces, especially when oil was priced so high (without anyone seeing prices would fall before it was too late). PET’s third way for eg in the 70s was to diversify exports ...

Government is their front office, Media's their mouthpiece, money's their fuel. Saudis R tied in.

6308 2018-12-18 15:21:58 So many in alberta are bred into victim mentality. Ever since the older  generation screwed them over by siding with US oil instead of Canadian  investment they have been crying the blues.
6309 2018-12-18 15:21:56 We're going to see a lot of people jumping on the western yellow jacket movement simply because they say "fuck the government" and you know, that's really cool.

Be smart, don't support the anti-immigration, upper class oil workers who have no concern for our environment.

6311 2018-12-18 15:21:44 My number one issue is #ClimateChange. So yeah, I have a problem with electing rich people tied to Big Oil.

Your type’ only qualification is that the candidate has D in front of their name. Which is why we get people like Joe Manchin & lose elections to people like Trump.
6312 2018-12-18 15:21:39 You’re proposed solutions involve ignoring environmental, health & safety concerns & contravening FN Treaty Rights. Not a very smart precedent to set, nor an action most Canadians support. Or are you fine with unfettered oil production, regardless of the consequences?
6313 2018-12-18 15:21:33 Americans think it's for the oil. #sad
6314 2018-12-18 15:21:32 Was a feeble attempt at humour. Denis Healy using the same script on oil that was used by Ian Wood & BetterTogether in 2014.

6321 2018-12-18 15:20:49 My friends and I were talking about environmental pullution. I said that in order to produce palm oil the rainforests get cut down. One of my friends haven't even known that we destroy the forests to get money!! It was really disappointing to see how little we know about reality.

6323 2018-12-18 15:20:30 Every decade, regardless of who is in power, oil industry takes a hit. Sucks, but reality. No party can control Global oil situation. None. Lack of pipeline and more refineries 20 -30 yrs ago would have solved this.

6327 2018-12-18 15:20:06 I find this all so odd. Is Israel refusing to do business with States that don't do this? If only Palestine had oil they would be a bigger player. Or diamonds or cobalt mines or....something
6328 2018-12-18 15:19:58 Not apples to apples...but AK's recent oil/gas lease sale yielded just $1.5m ($6.50/acre). MA just broke records w/ a $405m offshore wind auction at $1,000/acre.

6331 2018-12-18 15:19:33 Justin,  in your opinion is cannabis-infused coconut oil via the suppository route strong enough to fight cancer. Or does it need to be extracted and then mixed with the coconut oil? I've made it both ways, and realize the full extracted cannabis oil is much stronger. Thoughts?

6386 2018-12-18 15:15:32 a lesson to yall who use weed cartridges: the oil is typically pure canna oil (nice shit) or coconut oil suspension (cheaper, still decent). ‘Suspension’ being the operative term. 
Meaning with temperature extremes the contents will shift and become more/less viscous and can leak

6389 2018-12-18 15:15:20 Just to be clear, in our view last year's HB 331 (the oil tax credit bonding bill) remains an epic fail. Seriously, draining $20 B in fiscal reserves isn't enough; some #akleg voted to push off yet another $1 B in costs to future generations through bonding. Our view? Reverse it.
6390 2018-12-18 15:15:14 In 2015, Nigeria had about 70million poor people & India had about 176million. Within 3yrs, India pulled 102million people out of poverty, they have no oil.

6404 2018-12-18 15:13:24 This was rhetoric, but you need to look below it. Without Harper, would Alberta and Saskatchewan have been less reliant on oil? I don’t think so. They’re just too core to those economies to have had any meaningful diversification.

6411 2018-12-18 15:12:43 Dec. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is boosting Petroleos Mexicanos’ budget to 464.6 billion pesos ($23 billion) next year to reverse flagging oil production and increase domestic fuel output.

6414 2018-12-18 15:12:36 "Break no law" is typically implied, but contracts are lame and cumbersome things filled with all sorts of boilerplate language that just keeps recirculating (see Oil and Gas Leases). This clause isn't unusual against the backdrop of so many other "standard" contract bits.
6415 2018-12-18 15:12:32 May be all the #Remainers #nodeal folks should go out and buy all the olive oil or canned tomatoes in the shops in a coordinated way over a day or two. To show what the future might look like if we crash over the cliff.

6418 2018-12-18 15:12:23 World oil market critics say oil is down due to an over supply of stored oil. What a load of Sh**. The world needs an over supply in stock at all times due to an unstable world. We can't starve the system of oil to drive prices up. The world has become soly reliable on oil alone

6424 2018-12-18 15:11:36 I’m from SK and I’m old enough to remember the last time oil was in the crapper. Oil is a cyclical market but the last upswing lasted so long I don’t think anyone a few years younger than me has any independent memory of serious downturns.

6429 2018-12-18 15:11:02 Big oil, with hundreds of billions in reserves on their balance sheet (which they want to sell).. are winning the race and will individually succeed at the detriment of the species.

The same competitive nature that has benefited us greatly, will also destroy us if left unchecked
6430 2018-12-18 15:11:01 Oil is under $50 a barrel. Since it wasn’t addressed during the election, except by one candidate. I guess we’re still in the boom or bust cycle so get ready for a bust with energy workers looking for crossover jobs.
6431 2018-12-18 15:11:00 Some kids play in dust, mud, etc you should be grateful to have the oil and the car

6436 2018-12-18 15:10:47 Do you really think any government would have diversified Alberta’s economy away from oil? I can’t see it. Sounds great in theory, but in the real world economies don’t turn away from their biggest resource, especially when the price was so high.
6437 2018-12-18 15:10:42 The whole victim mentality of we r being attacked by environmentalist and dark money. When the oil and gas industry makes billion dollar profits in a quarter. Think about it!
6438 2018-12-18 15:10:42 I was water and you were oil, so we didn't mix.
6439 2018-12-18 15:10:37 Oh I see. So I starred physiotherapy today. Came home smelling like olive oil and Guillermo is confused. I don't think he likes the taste of olive oil. (We are in week 3 of social training. Getting him used to different types of people, crowds and loud kids. It's tough.)
6440 2018-12-18 15:10:31 Trump chose Tillerson to be SoS. Tillerson received the Order of Friendship from Putin and wanted Exxon to buy Russia's oil through Rosneft. The deal was estimated to be $500 BILLION. Exxon couldn't, though, because the US had sanctions against Russia.  1/
6441 2018-12-18 15:10:30 ..."we want to be an oil superpower!" rhetoric. With respect, I think Canada's -- and Albeta's! -- reliance on oil as a driver in the economy was materially affected by Harper.

6477 2018-12-18 15:08:17 But higher oil prices was used as an excuse to raise prices on food and at the gas pumps.  Companies are now price gouging consumers by NOT lowering prices as oil prices and shipping costs have now lowered for a long time.  It is unfair! Only corps and the rich benefit.
6478 2018-12-18 15:08:11 Talk to the oil companies    They're the ones laying off Canadians.

Oil is a dying industry, propped up with billions each year in tax payer subsidies, tax breaks, give-aways.

6492 2018-12-18 15:06:59 So I’m at tireman getting an oil change and one of the workers came in and yelled for Donna and some dude goes no Lee, Donna is my wife that died 5 years ago and honestly I’ve never been more uncomfortable in my life 
6493 2018-12-18 15:06:55 C’est pas faux : 2005 est l’année du peak oil conventionnel. C’est très tendu depuis. Donc j’ai du mal à voir une société ultra industrialisée sans pétrole.
6494 2018-12-18 15:06:48 Thats always the excuse. Venezuela has one of the largest oil fields in the world. They are resource rich. The govt took over the oilfields (seized the means of production), to funnel the money into itself, under the auspices of redistributing the wealth. It was a catastrophe
6495 2018-12-18 15:06:39 Come on, you know exactly what's going on. Elon is disrupting the most power companies in the world: Oil, gas, Energy, Space flight, and transportation. You think those guys are just going to just let him disrupt them without a war? Money talks. Greed
6496 2018-12-18 15:06:30 Yeg cheering on amazon....worst record ever for employees not being treated fairly but we'll celebtate that and give oil and gas corps bail outs. Lol lol lol i shouldnt watch the news.
6497 2018-12-18 15:06:16 If it's the company's that buy oil then why does Canada flip the bill for pipelines and notley pushing for more? The companies should be 100% buying these lines and gov't stay out of it. I'm asking cause I'm curious
6498 2018-12-18 15:06:12 I was talking to someone today who said she just tosses them in a little olive oil, salt and pepper and then roasts the hell out of them. She said it was delicious!
6499 2018-12-18 15:06:04 Why should we be bound by the laws of any contract with Saudia Arabia?, they clearly play by their own rules... Lets just stop importing their oil that will do way more damage to them.

6512 2018-12-18 15:04:50 With respect, I think Canada’s reliance on oil was not materially affected by Harper’s enthusiasm for oil. I also think critics are unfair in not recognizing how rare it is for a government to reduce spending to avoid a deficit from becoming a long term problem. I can’t think ...

6517 2018-12-18 15:04:15 With 11 years to go to mitigate climate catastrophe, the Liberals should not be giving 1.5 billion to an (oil) industry that has received corporate welfare for decades - we need climate action now, not pipelines or cont oil extraction #Cdnpoli #ClimateAction #skpoli

6527 2018-12-18 15:03:45 Also, culturally, different regions in India are tuned to use peanut oil/sesame seed oil/mustard oil for curries and deep fried foods as well.
6528 2018-12-18 15:03:28 Big meeting today with a potential investor in our oil company. We’ve been trying for 3 years to get some outside money to drill new wells!
6529 2018-12-18 15:03:17 I can’t speak for these investors but there are a few reasons to be long. (1) belief that technology will change the economic picture (2) potential consolidation by the majors (3) the idea that these stocks trade in line with oil prices, so being long is a bet on rising prices.
6530 2018-12-18 15:03:12 got my oil changed for free today, got coffee & breakfast for free as well... i think i am having what the kids call, “a good day”?
6531 2018-12-18 15:03:00 How many legitimate skeptics are there? Every single time is have seen one, I looked them up and they were on an oil, gas, coal company’s payroll. Seriously.
6532 2018-12-18 15:02:59 #ooc The best way to spend my morning is definitely sitting at the dealership because my car is leaking oil. Yay. 
6533 2018-12-18 15:02:57 High paying jobs are gone because of the price of oil.
5 years ago there were line ups 300 people deep for pharmacy cashiers.
I saw it myself.
Nobody cared then if they got work, as long as they were working.
Suicides were through the roof.
6534 2018-12-18 15:02:54 The problem is the timing...This whole CAPEX slowdown will take months to be felt and oil prices are dropping like a stone. Look at the price action in the last few days. It is a near panic to liquidate.

6537 2018-12-18 15:02:37 The "We gave $150 B to Iran" story doesn't serve a foundational purpose…funds that Iran got access to had been frozen & were payments by other countries for delivered oil/gas from Iran.

6547 2018-12-18 15:01:12 ...was a strategy also intended to promote oil. His brilliant work condescending to Americans over "no brainer" decisions really helped. So when the crash hit, we suffered more. We need not have had a low growth economy for 7 years. Harper certainly didn't help...
6548 2018-12-18 15:01:12 @todd_harrison You'd think that cannabis is made from oil the way its trading. Is there a less loved sector out there at this point? (Hoping we can get peak disdain going soon)
6549 2018-12-18 15:00:48 It is worth pointing out the bull flattening of the local curves, likely on the bacl of lower oil prices and concerns on the growth cycle. The move of the day is the CZK swap curve. The 2-5Y is now inverted, it has been the first time since 2008! #EmergingMarkets #CzechRepublic

6560 2018-12-18 15:00:16 @Canada @JustinTrudeau so we're giving another $1.6 billion to bailout to oil & gas companies to "protect jobs" in the oilsands while they're giving billions in dividends to shareholders. Who are we bailing out here and why is this not going to renewables and retraining programs?

6562 2018-12-18 15:00:13 You want a Volvo? European cars can’t hack it in our muggy climate. The compressor doesn’t last. And certain ones drink oil like an Scotsman drinks beer.

6566 2018-12-18 14:59:54 Ha ha ha......

Remember when the SNP never shut up about oil?

Guess What?

Oil revenues since the SNP took power in 2007 are less than the fiscal transfer (subsidy) from the rUK!

Figures later......

6572 2018-12-18 14:59:37 I’m adulting pretty well today. Woke up early so I went ahead and dragged myself to the dealership for an oil change.

6575 2018-12-18 14:59:24 ...in early 2015 thanks to Harper's policies and the oil crash. The two are inextricably linked as putting our eggs in the oil basket was the #1 strategy for Harper. His attempts to "grease the wheels" are what came back to bite the industry. His anti-environmental rhetoric...

6585 2018-12-18 14:58:18 Clear this up for me @albertaNDP,
I get the Alebrta wants to build pipelines to sell oil to foreign markets. We currently have pipelines on the east and west coast, so if we can’t sell our oil now, how is building more pipelines going to help?
6586 2018-12-18 14:58:05 I think your statement is factual. We the People do not like it when you choose and pick the ones you like to cover. Cover and expose all evil....like the ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas.

6598 2018-12-18 14:57:05 Analysts say another petrol price cut may be on the cards as brent crude oil prices continue to fall.  Crude oil lost four percent this morning, dropping to a low of 58-dollars-per-barrel. This comes as result of an over supply prompted by rising US oil inventories.

6676 2018-12-18 14:50:14 Finna get up get some gas. A oil change. Car wash.

6679 2018-12-18 14:50:05 brought the car in for oil change, tires rotated, etc. Driving from home to the dealer, went through about a mile of pretty dense fog in #themetrys. As I came out from under the I-10 overpass at Vets, sunny and clear. Has me thinking of an alternate timeline story.
6680 2018-12-18 14:49:53 Reading my mind? I started putting castor oil and coconut oil on my brows and lashes yesterday 
6681 2018-12-18 14:49:48 So we’re taking lessons in #Deregulation from #Trump now? He just replaced his Secretary of Interior (Environment Minister) w. a former oil industry executive. This is ‘expert’ advice for @NEWS957 listeners? #BigOil #OffshoreDrilling #ResourceExtraction @paigemacp @taxpayerDOTcom

6685 2018-12-18 14:49:18 You should buy an oil derrick
6686 2018-12-18 14:49:05 Maybe that's how they save money on disposal of used deep frying oil? LOL

6689 2018-12-18 14:48:43 The U.S. has become the world's largest producer of oil at a record 11.7 million barrels per day, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.
6690 2018-12-18 14:48:39 I think after Trump's election it is also about increasing sanctions on other countries. F.e. increased sanctions on Iran, Venezuela + Cuba all benefit Russia concerning oil/gas control + driving these countries in the arms of  Russia. Trump is the no 1 USA national thread!
6691 2018-12-18 14:48:38 perfumr oil factoryはキンモクセイも最高だしどれがツボった香りか思い出せないから実店舗行きたいし、武蔵野ワークスは4 mLのやつを色々試したい

 * OPEC+ production cuts will take time to kick in
6695 2018-12-18 14:48:29 How many people die because of the laws and rules that you career politicians make being on big pharma payroll how about standing up to big pharma big oil the insurance  industries that will never happen because they are your bosses

6698 2018-12-18 14:48:08 I agree with weak global consumer. This comes down to global decline rates for oil which nobody has a good handle on. But if they are 3.5% (conservative) you need a new Iran every single year not including demand growth. Price controls will lead to chaotic price increases.
6699 2018-12-18 14:48:07 I support the oil and gas industry. If you aren’t happy about this just unfollow me cause you literally will not change my mind about it.
6700 2018-12-18 14:48:03 Me to husband: it’s 2018, you can cook your own dinner

Also me: what’s the purpose of a husband if you won’t get the oil changed in my car. That’s what men do!

6703 2018-12-18 14:47:50 With thanks to Jim Cotter for this verse for today 18 December.... O Come O Come, appointed one, to be God's love for everyone, to speak on God's behalf and show as much of God as need we know. Rejoice! Rejoice! A fragrant oil shall soon anoint for blessed toil.
6704 2018-12-18 14:47:50 Girls don dey wash pant with anointing oil.
6705 2018-12-18 14:47:45 We have gold, diamond, bauxite, copper, aluminium, cocoa, oil, yeah that's what we pride ourselves in, just mere words which do not benefit us but are rather exported in large quantities to the white man's land just like it was in the time of slavery. So what has really changed?
6706 2018-12-18 14:47:43 Well done state of New York for holding oil companies accountable and leading the way towards a #fossilfree world
6707 2018-12-18 14:47:41 That's true. Venezuela was sabotaged for its largest oil reserves in the world that they wanted to use for the benefit of the whole nation rather than for the few.
6708 2018-12-18 14:47:39 The oil industry doesn’t need that money just let them build pipelines to move their oil!  The sooner anti Canadian, pro Globalist Trudeau is gone the better!
6709 2018-12-18 14:47:36 But you have slagged off iwobi all last season when we all know he is a young player who was out form and confident.,
Is season u pick a player and u slag him off.bellerin wenger iwobi ozil, oil etc..
6710 2018-12-18 14:47:30 So u 2 dont understand anything about basic physics.Rather than taking instructions from the oil industry why dont u do an online course and then you might be able to at least understand the basics.All planets with atmospheres experience warming thru Newtons laws +thermodynamics

6716 2018-12-18 14:46:48 ...I give no credit to them for leaving things in good standing. They were still in good standing thanks to Chretien/Martin. There was now a structural deficit, and an oil patch hoist on Harper's "no brainer" all bets on the US petard. Virtually all of the current...
6717 2018-12-18 14:46:47 Because it was all about stealing their oil right? Or was it a secret war for Israel? Or perhaps it was ordered by Haliburton?

You can claim it was poorly conceived, much like entering WW1 , but you have to be conspiratorial to think Bush had evil motives for it.

6739 2018-12-18 14:45:01 I assume Corsi would say that Big Pharma would go after a doctor who cured cancer just as hard as Big Oil went after that guy who invented the water engine.
6740 2018-12-18 14:45:00 I for one like having someone with a ton of knowledge in the oil and gas sector raising the problems that are totally gutting your (Alberta’s) economy. It must really suck that somebody with some social media following is trying to protect your interests.
6741 2018-12-18 14:44:58 (2/2) WB may have failed to sell heat pumps in the UK but that is because of their corporate inadequacies and nothing to do with the technology.  Some folk are contributing positively to the climate change challenge: peddlers of oil boilers are not!  Shame on them.
6742 2018-12-18 14:44:56 It sucks how Trudeau controls the price of oil.
6743 2018-12-18 14:44:53 I had hoped it wasn't true but there it is.

Obama increased USA oil production every year he was in office. He asks us in this interview to say thank you?

Thank you for increased intensity of storms, forest fires, sea level rise, reduced agricultural output and insectageddon!!!
6744 2018-12-18 14:44:49 The ever shifting definition of hate speech. Read The Gulag archipelago if you have any delusion that apposing hate speech is actually a moral tenable position.

Thank you for saving the phrase  “Merry Christmas” for all of us. 

Otherwise, I surely wouldn’t have remembered to say “Merry Christmas, you treasonous, lying, decrepit, obnoxious, illiterate piece of racist maggot shit”! 

Thanks, again, Donald!

"SNAKE OIL - ONLY $80 PER BOTTLE ... A BARGAIN AT TWICE THE PRICE!"
6778 2018-12-18 14:42:01 Canadians should begin talking about paying Alberta to keep the oil in the ground. The $4.5 billion for Trudeau's stalled pipeline could have been a start.

6780 2018-12-18 14:41:32 This is not a downturn. Oil is at a good price & we sell in US bucks. This is a Greens imposed, federally sanctioned block by Trudeau. We need new customers. Oil demand grows. Other countries fill the need. We are cut off at the knees. A pipeline to tanker is the only answer.

6802 2018-12-18 14:39:36 Once again, it doesn't seem the interventions in Iraq or Afghanistan have taught you anything. Venezuela is an oil-producing country - mind you; it's citizens are unlikely to be of any concern to the intervention; mostly securing oil fields and putting them into "right" hands.
6803 2018-12-18 14:39:30 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

6806 2018-12-18 14:39:18 But it is supply and demand. Shale has flooded the market for years now and the market is acting accordingly. If American oil producers want a higher price, stop pumping so much god damn oil.

6823 2018-12-18 14:37:39 We'll see but oil demand is at an all time record high and price has fallen for 80 days. Waiting to see if demand is actually softening but my guess is low prices will spur demand growth. If oil doesn't turn soon and go much much higher, everything I believe about oil is wrong.
6824 2018-12-18 14:37:35 Commodities: #Palm Oil +4.99%, #Naturalgas +4.79%
Top commodity gainers are Palm Oil (4.99%), Natural gas (4.79%), #Ironore (2.22%), #Canola (1.78%), #Zinc (.67%)#Gold (.41%) and #Steel (.51%). Biggest losers are #CrudeOil (-2.15%), #Gasoline (-1.98%) and #Copper (-1.82%).
6825 2018-12-18 14:37:34 @SquawkStreet OH JESUS Cramer again with YOUR stupidity that stupidly cheap #oil is good. It PROVED NOT to be good for anyone in 2016 when you screamed the same crapolla. 

Stable oil at $60ish WTI is good for EVERYONE.

6831 2018-12-18 14:37:18 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

6843 2018-12-18 14:35:58 Well, it is a complicated computation for them. If done correctly, i.e. not deforesting for biomasse and not competing with food production, emissions are better than emissions from oil and coal.

6847 2018-12-18 14:35:28 Oil looks tempting when Brent Crude hits $50. Not sure if it falls back there, this could be the bottom, but I don't see it going much lower than $50 for very long if it does drop more.

6855 2018-12-18 14:35:04 The CPC and ONPC are willing to sell out her generation just for the sake of lining their and their oil executive friends' pockets. It's great that she's informed and already smarter than the entire CPC and ONPC caucuses.

6863 2018-12-18 14:34:28 The price per barrel of oil does not show there's a slow down on the national and World stage economically. There are vastly more options for energy such as Natural Gas and solar. Oil while still the main driver of business is not the only one. Many more producers than ever.

6868 2018-12-18 14:34:15 For years I have read books & tweets predicting fracking’s demise.  Yet here in TX the Permian seems to offer a growing supply and a drag on oil price increases for a long time. Policies discouraging consumption seem to offer more bang for the $ than attempts to restrict supply.
6869 2018-12-18 14:34:04 Made an appointment to get my oil changed at my dealership... but I worked last night and it’s at 10:30. Say a prayer for me that I don’t fall asleep while attempting to stay awake for it.

6880 2018-12-18 14:33:25 2/2 Corruption was rife. The good of oil revenues were an enjoyment for the ruling family and the close.

6889 2018-12-18 14:32:10 Yes, I believe the number is the fragrance ref number which can be used by the company to backtrack to  the actual oil in the formula.
6890 2018-12-18 14:32:10 Tio my car smells like it’s burning and I mentioned to my dad that it might be bc it’s due for an oil change. He told me nah it’s fine. He wants to drive it to Burbank but no, it needs an oil change. Told me stop telling him what to do. Got mad bc I haven’t bought the oil yet.
6891 2018-12-18 14:32:08 I’m too lazy to do my own oil change so I’m at the VW dealer near my house. It’s nice here but they really need a stronger sales staff.

6902 2018-12-18 14:30:32 That is incorrect as their expenses keep on going higher and the oil revenue is not much better now than in 2014. Plus they cannot run the reserves to zero.

6904 2018-12-18 14:30:25 IMO, using what Talbot did or didn't do w/ NYR, as a back-up, is of little use when it comes to him as a starter. It's two different worlds. Also, just so we are clear, there is no doubt who should have the Oilers net at the moment and it's not particularly close. #Koskinen
6905 2018-12-18 14:30:13 Let me guess, this is a conservative thread.  The law and order people are turning their backs and listening to a known con man and snake oil salesman with a record of corruption a mile long.

Shameful.
6906 2018-12-18 14:29:59 Hull is not place to teach Philosophy. Arguably not the best place to even have a college dedicated to ensuring fish and chip merchants change their frying oil at least once a decade. But I’ll listen to the arguments for old oil and rancid smell in the interests of Hull.
6907 2018-12-18 14:29:59 Oh no :(((( It helped me more than I thought it would (fibro type stuff), but I got the Maeng Da strain the doctor recommended.  CBD oil is not really helping me so far, even after I swish it in my mouth 10-20 minutes first.

6911 2018-12-18 14:29:54 Más de acuerdo no puedo estar. Anotaría q la gran diferencia es q al menos en esa época estaba mejor. Tasas iban hacía  al = q precio oil ; deuda había,  PIB y nos favorecían los spreads en caso de una destorcida como al final sucedió.

6929 2018-12-18 14:28:25 Question: What if the provinces, acting in their own people's best interests, say "hey since we don't get any oil royalties and since this shit is really dangerous and bad for the planet we really don't want you pumping it through here"..?  
Answer: pay them a dividend.
6930 2018-12-18 14:28:20 I do not believe  anything  that has to do with Oil Companies that will be Safe for Our Environment. Because  it all about what you can destroy to get oil,gas,minerals and so on.

6934 2018-12-18 14:27:37 Sounds like a good idea but if they did that where would the Irving Refinery buy their oil?? AB can’t supply it thanks to Quebec blocking Energy East. US would love to sell  their oil at virtually no discount, AB discounts oil by $30 USD when we export, or Maybe Venezuela?

6939 2018-12-18 14:27:08 That pulled the Nasdaq Composite into the red for the year, while U.S. crude settled below $50 a barrel for the first time in 14 months. Oil prices continued to slide on today.
6940 2018-12-18 14:27:04 That's what the federal government is actually doing. But, perhaps you prefer that the rights of others, the Constitution, and the law ought to be quashed, and martial invoked to build a pipeline for the oil companies.
6941 2018-12-18 14:27:00 To be honest I am a bit dizzy with oil..From a low 51 handle close on Friday to almost 48 this morning. The price action is beyond being bad. Not even stocks are doing this bad.

6951 2018-12-18 14:26:23 When it comes to Talbot's first yr, it is a narrative. Outside of a few weeks, he was very good in yr one, fantastic in yr two, bordered on being terrible last season and has been worse this yr. IMO, it is fairly straightforward and yet many see it differently. Makes no sense.

6953 2018-12-18 14:26:11 I had an '88 Camry in much worse condition in college. It was amazing. 33 mpg, easy to service (I changed an alternator in 15 minutes), and I learned to tell by sound when the oil level was low.

Money is an issue at the club otherwise we wouldn't have Smalling, Jones and two old failed wingers at full backs.

We cannot compete with oil money and the rumor is Glazers want to sell. 

Spurs are on the way up, have a good team.

6972 2018-12-18 14:24:43 He was speaking to Quebec, on behalf of Calgary's Oil and Gas industry.

You're staying the dumbest things and are making the Oil and Gas industry look like a bunch of Neanderthals when in reality it's full of hard workers and the brightest minds in the province, Cory.
6973 2018-12-18 14:24:41 See. I don't play. Now that I'm not drinking I have even less of an excuse. Meanwhile have you explored Aramiessentials?? I testify to their Glow (Shea nut) oil! Itunu my acne is getting better!!!! I can't believe it

6978 2018-12-18 14:23:54 More or less yes. Nicola sold them independence while relying on oil revenue. Then the ass fell out of the barrel. But how can she justify calling for independence when the UK gives them billions£ every year to keep them afloat. But I admit I don't really know.

I watched Talbot long before he was an Oiler. Good solid goalie for stretches. But is he 2017/18 Talbot. 
I tend to think not. And this team needs that. MK is helping prove that recently.
6997 2018-12-18 14:22:11 Unfortunately, your copytrade service was buying oil (continue to lose $) in my account while you were signaling/selling/profiting with the trend in your main account. After a month, my frustration is settling in.

7007 2018-12-18 14:21:09 Hi, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
7008 2018-12-18 14:21:01 Obama tried to KILL our oil industry!!!
7009 2018-12-18 14:20:50 There will be some spiteful retort about how much the Feds gave Quebec or something about bombardier I guarantee. The oil crowd is never happy
7010 2018-12-18 14:20:50 Yes I don't understand why Louisiana would want the oil industry in its gulf its dangerous to the fishing industry. Wind farms would look better. We need to upgrade our power grids to solar anyway. We could nationalize Entergy and s&wb = jobs 4 released
7011 2018-12-18 14:20:16 I can be your oil boy
7012 2018-12-18 14:20:15 Oil falling not a reflection of demand, and last night a clue that they are using the same HFT tactics to bomb oil that have worked in gold suppression for years. This will be a fantastic foundation for a bull market in oil unless they destroy the world in the process.
7013 2018-12-18 14:20:09 I use master facial scrub. I'm a girl and I have really oily skin and this is effective. Also after washing your face use eskinol and before sleeping use eskinol. Also always bring oil control sheets any brand will do.

7029 2018-12-18 14:18:47 I started out changing oil and focused on providing the business value. I became the store manager within a year. I had blue hair and the owner hated it. Made me wear a hat. He still promoted me. Ambition is applicable across all jobs, and I've worked blue collar most my life.
7030 2018-12-18 14:18:43 Would you look at that. They do nothing that the people want until we come to an election year.......
Now all the sudden they have changed their stance on Alberta’s oil industry. How can anyone be so naive.

7033 2018-12-18 14:18:36 Sure sure, but that's not the bulk of audience. That's just collateral damage right now. You know well how he's going to spin this. He'll say America's the biggest oil and gas producer, and that China really wants to buy, etc.
7034 2018-12-18 14:18:28 I'm sure that figure gets much worse if you believe (as I do) that it was/is British oil and not allocated solely to Scotland.

7036 2018-12-18 14:18:25 People always forget how wasteful of electricity bitcoin is and how expensive it is to mine. Turning coal oil and coltan into fucking equations to make monopoly money. What a shit show.
7037 2018-12-18 14:18:23 The issue is that our oil can't effectively make it to the world market. Companies are producing more than can be shipped with current pipeline and rail capacity, this depresses price for Alberta oil.
7038 2018-12-18 14:18:13 So basically as long as it is not a CFR,  u can mess it up as and when u please. 'Degradation' also occurs on 'pvt land', does it not?! Whereas am happy to eat 'veg oil',  the degradation caused by Oil palm and rubber growers world over is valid cause for concern, is it not?
7039 2018-12-18 14:18:11 Oil and gas, beacuse fuck the world and the rest of the national fucking economy that's why.  OIL and GAS!

7051 2018-12-18 14:16:58 No lie, dad was an off/on the wagon drunk.  During his drinking spells, mom used to put heavy doses of olive oil in his mashed potatoes to give him the squirts, preventing him from going out.  My aunt told me that mom once put ex-lax in his meal, (never confirmed).

7056 2018-12-18 14:16:38 So not only did we purchase an oil line for 4.5B that we aren’t gonna build, now we are gonna give another 1.6B to help out. Maybe you should have just let the pipeline be built. Would have been a lot cheaper for us taxpayers.

7061 2018-12-18 14:16:19 The funny thing is that what they demand will only reduce the price of oil.
7062 2018-12-18 14:16:16 Also nobody talks in these threads about how prohibitively expensive and wasteful it is to mine. Turning graphics cards and massive ammounts of electricity, and thus oil and coal, into a pyramid scheme bubble market with diminishing returns. It’s fucking wasteful pointless BS.
7063 2018-12-18 14:16:14 And replace it with what?  Until the world does not have a need for Oil what purpose does that serve?  Take the money you make off Oil and sink it into green technology.

7068 2018-12-18 14:15:50 Right, but a lot of his landlocked consumers also are directly involved in the oil industry.

Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota (which he bragged about winning), and much of the South & Southwest (especially Texas) are Home to some of the biggest oil & gas plays in North America.

7073 2018-12-18 14:15:32 And stop pretending, oil is reliable. You can have all the oil you want, if your turbine has a forced outage, you destabilize your entire electricity grid.

7081 2018-12-18 14:14:57 It’s also on Stephen Harper. For a decade he worked towards Canada being a one trick oil patch pony. Alberta believes oil is their identity. A dying industry. Trudeau should put that 1.6 billion into Alberta but for new, clean energy production.
7082 2018-12-18 14:14:56 @bobbybonesshow have the company note your account that gate must be closed at all times because of dogs. I had it done for the oil company. It also helps to have a sign on your gate too

7086 2018-12-18 14:14:31 Again didn’t Notley just look to cap production of Alberta oil because there is too much of it on the world market? How will building pipelines solve the issues we’re seeing? This is an honest question.
7087 2018-12-18 14:14:29 Obama built fixed that,  Obama ended war.  Obama made US top oil producer.  Hope and Change, brought results just as soon as Trump was elected & changed Washington DC.
7088 2018-12-18 14:14:29 The annual cost for oil changes on a Ford Pickup is 35 million. I said it so it must be true, don’t be lazy verify it yourself.

7091 2018-12-18 14:14:12 Because they're anti Oil socialists....seriously
7092 2018-12-18 14:14:07 Chanser because of obvious reasons. Arabic because it is spoken by many people, big in the global trade because of oil, Sweden sells weapons to them and I guess since Sweden now has a growing population of Arabic speaking people it could be good if some people know the language.
7093 2018-12-18 14:14:05 But we support gas and oil and fracking, and not the solar industry.

7095 2018-12-18 14:13:58 Lol oil
7096 2018-12-18 14:13:54 Madagascar has opened up a large area of marine territory - coastal waters w/a high level of biodiversity - to the oil industry. #WCPGW?
7097 2018-12-18 14:13:52 Oil & gas execs cheering blockchain (and associated energy requirements) on, politicians suggesting the use of an ICO to fund a border wall, poor town citizens picketing the development of windmills because they will be an eyesore (next to the burnt barn and cars on blocks)...
7098 2018-12-18 14:13:44 We need to change our mindset and start refining the oil in Canada as it = + jobs, + tax revenue, + being able to sell the oil not crude to the global market
7099 2018-12-18 14:13:43 Yo the guy that used to work at the old dealership I got my oil changes at now works at my new one & im HYPE cause he remembers me & used to hook me uppp

7101 2018-12-18 14:13:22 @JavierBlas @flacqua @tomkeene @biobio @sebastianpinera @hualpenciudad Javier, what is going on in Chile with Iranian oil?
7102 2018-12-18 14:13:16 There are so many agencies out there selling digital cleanups to ignorant public figures. It’s reverse SEO snake oil.
7103 2018-12-18 14:12:56 It's called coal mines, construction, oil/gas rigs. etc.  The other thing that all these have in common is they all require heavy lifting where men are more designed to do these tasks.
7104 2018-12-18 14:12:54 "A fool and his money are soon parted" ... these bible-thumping snake oil salesman seem to find enough fools every day to fund their elaborate lifestyle... there seems to be no end to the debauchery, material gain, and hatred achieved in the name of religion.

7106 2018-12-18 14:12:45 You have just as much ability to switch industries, or move like all the Ontarians did. 

Canada (and Alberta specifically) have put all their eggs in one basket with the Oil sands and now it's coming back to haunt them.

7110 2018-12-18 14:12:35 Hey, @BillNye ... a question somewhat out of the blue: Is it at all possible to build pipelines that shuttle Greenland ice melt into reservoirs and aquifers in North America? We do such things for oil. Just wondering if we could plan for our disastrous future, y'know?
7111 2018-12-18 14:12:33 Trump and WSJ Editorial request that FED determine monetary policy based on highly volatile oil and commodity prices is borderline idiotic. 

Can Trump and WSJ be any more stupid? Not only they screwed up GOP control of the House, now they wanna mess up the country too?

7113 2018-12-18 14:12:24 Good, have TX pay for it. Cut off the oil subsidies to TX, use the money saved..
7114 2018-12-18 14:12:20 Pissing off both #climate conscious and climate deniers at the same time with contradictory messages, impressive! Dismantle fossil fuel subsidies now, impose #carbontax on all polluters, retrain oil & gas workers to work on renewable economy. Reduce tax burden on #renewables.
7115 2018-12-18 14:12:10 For the same work. Wages are higher. Thats the only difference. And if your making that much money and still whining.....your just a whiner. Typical Conjob pitting east vs west. You just made my point. Good luck moving ANY oil to Tidewater when you separate! LMFAO!

A hard border poses more problems for an isolated Eng with no deal than an Indy Sco in the EU! Amongst Sco exports to Eng - oil, water, electricity - I'm sure Eng would manage just fine without them!

7120 2018-12-18 14:11:45 If oil remains in $60-68 range for prolonged period of time, Really good news for our economy and in turn Indian equities... 
7121 2018-12-18 14:11:34 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
7122 2018-12-18 14:11:26 They say data is the new oil. In this age of AI, who is the Saudi Arabia of Data?
7123 2018-12-18 14:11:23 Nigeria want to diversify economy from oil to Agriculture BUT failed to tame the herdsmen who believed they can roam aimlessly from one location to another, destroying people's farmlands and setting it ablaze. The most painful aspect of it is that, perpetrators never get caught!
7124 2018-12-18 14:11:18 I don’t enjoy eating anything with oil and yaji with spoon or fork
7125 2018-12-18 14:11:12 Could you ask big oil to send my check?  I have been waiting for it for over ten years.  I need it for Christmas presents.
7126 2018-12-18 14:11:02 @cathmckenna 800,000 bbls of oil just got tankered into the east coast today. Just thought you should know.

7132 2018-12-18 14:10:12 available your just waisting your time. The best thing I can suggest is we send you for oldtime sake a litre of our palest oil free of charge and you place it in sunlight, you might get it to go lighter also you should play with sun thickening.

7134 2018-12-18 14:10:09 Norway is a big producer of gas and oil so please don't use it as an example.

7136 2018-12-18 14:10:08 Getting an oil change in the truck today, going to the gym, then a little shopping for vacation!! I need a few more tops.  C'mon ladies..  we all do it, don't we? New clothes for vaca??

7138 2018-12-18 14:10:02 Try lavender oil or a lavender infused lotion! It’s great for all kinds of anxiety. Lush has one that I’ve heard is amazing and Whish has one that smells so comforting.
7139 2018-12-18 14:09:59 Although I always encourage artists to grind and manipulate their materials to improve the handling and understanding I feel you are going off at a tangent and over complicating the process. Unless you can clean the purity of your oil to be lighter than that commercially

7146 2018-12-18 14:09:13 This is your answer, when you store paintings in the dark they go dark, bring them into a good light the clean up. This is very well known. You should always dry your paintings in a good light as this helps fix the cleaness of the oil. Note what I said yesterday

7150 2018-12-18 14:09:07 You have to admit, even when not tied up with the fossil fuel interests (as not just Big Oil is, but also utilities, autos, defense, etc.), the restraint on finance and tax evasion is to them threatening in the extreme.

7169 2018-12-18 14:07:06 What an idiot. Instead of getting us in a position to stop Saudi oil, he chooses to hurt Canada instead. Idealism over common sense. Who are these idiots still supporting Trudeau. Do they have to loose THEIR  jobs before they see sense!
7170 2018-12-18 14:07:00 40 miles per hour wind gusts are emptying the black oil sunflower seed out of the feeders, much to the squirrels' and mourning doves' delights. Trouble is, those ground feeders are hawks' delights and they've gotten two already this morning. Heartbreaking to see!

7180 2018-12-18 14:05:11 This is a National crisis. We happily count Alberta oil in our GDP numbers when times are good. Alberta helped when the east coast fisheries died. Can we not all pitch in a bit to help Alberta ... help ourselves?

7189 2018-12-18 14:04:05 I disagree. Look at the push for offshore drilling, Arctic exploration, fracking; look at the ongoing wars in the Middle East. Big Oil means to protect its market share for a long time to come, and they are not giving it up without a fight. (Even Big Coal continues to resist.)

7193 2018-12-18 14:04:02 And oil was $100 to $140 a barrel. Today it’s $50. Ain’t brain surgery, rocket science or Gaddafi. Simple Econ 101.

7195 2018-12-18 14:03:45 they sell the oil at luckys but it’s kinda expensive i got it when it was on sale
7196 2018-12-18 14:03:44 Stop bailing out profitable  oil companies, @JustinTrudeau @AliEhsassi
7197 2018-12-18 14:03:43 Crude oil price in 2013 was $100 , today it's $ 59 .
Crude oil price has   fallen by 40% petrol just by 10% .
7198 2018-12-18 14:03:38 That's the narrative people like to go on about but it's not accurate. Talbot had a tough end of Oct/start to Nov and then sat for a few weeks b/c his backup was hot. After he returned in mid-December, he was lights out. In other words, he had a rough patch.

7205 2018-12-18 14:03:00 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
7206 2018-12-18 14:02:38 Actually Mary it wouldn’t.  Canada has trade agreements, Alberta does not.  And lol neither Canada nor the United States has signed the landlocked country agreement.

7223 2018-12-18 14:01:31 The US uses about 9m barrels per day of gasoline (not oil), so a very long road to hoe.
7224 2018-12-18 14:01:08 Another thing to note from those graphs is Norway's CCS capacity. CCS seems to correlate strongly with the oil industry, not only for infrastructure reasons, but for political ones too.

7242 2018-12-18 14:00:12 I stand with @segalink ,even with the oil all over them, they could be victims of the circumstance. As a matter of fact it is highly doubtful my lord that the hands of these innocent ones could have gotten as far up as the oil on the car. There is also the issue of intent.

7269 2018-12-18 13:58:26 I tell you women are so mean you make one joke about the Doctor putting her in the stirrups  and checking her oil and they tell you she wishes you were a girl for the first 48 hours of a period.

7271 2018-12-18 13:58:18 So what?  Thiel said “no concerns whatsoever ”. Seriously, you just wrote an article about something that didn’t exist just because you wanted it to.  You are a joke. Was this an Oil and Gas paid gig?  You took the big payday piece?  If so we will find out.  Hack.

7279 2018-12-18 13:56:55 We have accepted for decades that Saudi Arabia is an autocratic kingdom ruled by men who could care less what the outside world thinks of them. There arrogance has been bolstered buy their vast oil wealth and the world is impotent to stop or change their behavior. Deal with it
7280 2018-12-18 13:56:52 I just noticed Jacob changed my oil
7281 2018-12-18 13:56:50 It is all about oil money for Putin and Saudi Arabia and we all need to understand this. trump and his administration are acting as foreign agents and lobbyists for the world’s oil profiteers and number 1 is Putin.
7282 2018-12-18 13:56:45 Can you imagine the excitement there would of been in the oil industry if the headline would of read,  “ The Federal Government Gives Approval to the 2 Proposed Pipelines” vs a  support package!

7294 2018-12-18 13:55:40 Alberta's oil has a terrible reputation worldwide, the government of Alberta has tried for the past 3 years to improve it, this is undoing their efforts.
7295 2018-12-18 13:55:40 Never forget..... They noisiest wheel always gets the most oil!!....
7296 2018-12-18 13:55:38 LOL true. Transfer payments to Alberta to build an oil infrastructure that will help them prosper.

7311 2018-12-18 13:54:57 "Extra virgin snake oil" is the best thing I've read in a while. So much (well-deserved) derision in such a tiny package. It's hilarious.

At least some of the $.
7315 2018-12-18 13:54:25 I'll hopefully be able to walk by January this CBD oil is fvkn awesome 
7316 2018-12-18 13:54:19 Nothing being reported on the benefits of pipeline I see. 
No wonder the people of Quebec are brainwashed to simply say no. Wake up Quebec, you are literally buying oil from Saudi Arabia when you could buy from Canada. Do your own research & stop listening to these media outlets.

It’s still a long ways away, but he’s filled a gap until end of next season likely. Then we’ll know if MK can be a legit starter.

7323 2018-12-18 13:54:06 Fold in nine ounces of olive oil and raise the temperature.
7324 2018-12-18 13:53:59 Fun fact.  Since 2006 the amount of Saudi oil used by Quebec dropped to zero.  80% of Quebec’s oil comes from North America, more than half of that comes from western Canada.  Don’t believe the Tory lies.

7336 2018-12-18 13:53:01 Definitely needed.  I have a 28 year old younger sister who recently asked me how to make coffee.....  Not convinced she would know the difference between a coffee filter and an oil filter....
7337 2018-12-18 13:52:56 Is that it?  With the scandal that have broken for 2 years on state capture, bell Pottinger, VBS, home affairs , Gupta, oil reserves sold, nuclear, 50 percent of learners don't make it to grade 12...that is your irrafutable proof that the media is corrupt.

7342 2018-12-18 13:52:35 Nowadays brands put “natural” or “infused with coconut oil” on damn near everything just so you can buy it. I just make my own shit now or stick to what was never broken.

7346 2018-12-18 13:52:16 Syrian government LEGALLY invited Russia & Iran while US is ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING 30% of Syria and mostly the oil rich areas where the ISIS is.
7347 2018-12-18 13:52:15 And oil and gas are found in abundance from multiple sources around the globe.  Cheap.

What I think: My hair has not been washed since Saturday. It’s in a messy bun and full of dry shampoo and tea tree oil.

7349 2018-12-18 13:52:13 I've bought and sent hundreds of gifts from The Olive Oil Taproom over the years! Always a hit. I LOVE @TheOliveOilTapr :)
7350 2018-12-18 13:52:11 These “let’s chuck some $ at it” short term fixes to quell discord and disenchantment w/ current fedgov not the answer, Trudeau etal need fix the real problem - build pipelines and move the f’n oil properly and profitably for everyone. This is just another #cdnjoke #liberalssuck

7355 2018-12-18 13:51:48 I said from the moment the Koskinen signing was announced that Chiarelli's hope was that he found a cheaper starter for '19-'20 and possibly '20-'21 and that was the reason for the $2.5M. Wasnt a fan of the move b/c of holes on the Oilers roster but always understood it.
7356 2018-12-18 13:51:48 Whistler - want's ALBERTA's Resource but no consequence! Apology not accepted! . They would rather buy oil from Saudi Arabia?? Remember the murdered journalist! Trudeau's virtual signaling is getting a BIT SICKENING!-CIBC&Whistler buy it!

7358 2018-12-18 13:51:29 It could be that Putin isn't denying climate change but welcoming it so Russia can access more fossil fuels under its land. Once restrictive ice melts, a greater area can be drilled for natural gas and oil.
7359 2018-12-18 13:51:26 The oil industry is in decline and it has nothing to do with us, that is where the world is headed.  How do you support an industry completely depended on world demand and free markets.  Cons are confusing.  They support working capitalism and free markets until they don’t.
7360 2018-12-18 13:51:21 Probably has something to do with density. For example, take a glass, then pour some water into it. Then, pour a layer of oil into it. Stir/mix as hard as you want, but they won't mix. This is because of liquid density. I imagine the same happens in the atmosphere of Jupiter.
7361 2018-12-18 13:50:58 I’ll be expecting to hear you !! So oil your tonsils and I’ll send you a cask strength to keep your extremities from mr. Frosty  xX

7363 2018-12-18 13:50:41 I wouldn't expect you to see 3500 S&P.We haven't seen such a steep move in the entire 36 yr secular bull market.That's what final parabolic legs are all about.Oil is going to drop way below $25 if we see a deflationary downturn bigger than any in past 80 yrs. Demand will plummet.
7364 2018-12-18 13:50:38 Please enlighten me, I am very curious to see how you are going to make the case that oil is so fantastic that you need to tell every body on Twitter about it...

7366 2018-12-18 13:50:34 The whole reason Trump is against environmentalist, is because he wants the world dependent on Russian oil, and he has a deal to prophet off of this oil,  back stabbing our future.
7367 2018-12-18 13:50:30 Alberta will soon not be an engine (never was " the " engine) for Canada. Canada needs an engine for the new economy that is more efficient, employs more Canadians and is good for the environment. Alberta must move away from oil and diversify.
7368 2018-12-18 13:50:20 I would just simply enjoy the vinegar with a drop of olive oil and bread ...meats and cheeses  over Christmas with friends . Taste the product !! :)
7369 2018-12-18 13:50:18 Yeah. Bc where did this 1.6bil come fr? Added to debt. They industry itself would have made easily 10x that each yr...all to buy rail cars for oil and help people ON EI (what about people who used it up already)
Next sector hurt by falling prices-ag.  oil = No room on rails

7374 2018-12-18 13:49:32 Those are Trump's words but not his actions. He views the military as a revenue-generating opportunity (see "take Iraq's oil" and the NATO shakedown for examples).

7376 2018-12-18 13:49:12 GOP has too much to gain. Their dream of privatizing the United States, of extracting every ounce of oil, of deregulation, of shrinking the government, of taking away social programs, of having a Christian nat, of having a republican president for life are all taking shape.
7377 2018-12-18 13:49:09 I would like all muslims to return to their home countries, I think we could agree to disagree on religion. We could coexist on the same planet, trade, even sightsee in eachothers countries. But trying to live together is like oil and water, it just doesn't work.

7382 2018-12-18 13:48:34 Marion King Hubbert who once worked for Shell gave birth to a ridiculously funny story about the origins of oil,you know the dead plants,forests and jurassic park dinosaurs fable being the source of black gold. Lol.This absurdity was believed by billions. Now it's co2's turn!
7383 2018-12-18 13:48:31 Oil free เราจะได้ free มั้ยคะ

You need to fix that. Buy a box from Iceland (palm oil free). Try them hot with brandy butter!
7385 2018-12-18 13:48:14 #Washington pushing governments to cut imports  #Iranian oil to zero. Fearing a price spike, it granted Iran’s biggest buyers - #China #India #SouthKorea #Japan #Italy #Greece #Taiwan and #Turkey - sanctions waivers. So sanctions are not blanket curb rather selective!

7390 2018-12-18 13:47:53 Also.... better chance MK is here next year over Talbot. Both won’t be. 
I think the changeover is happening before our eyes. 

It’s up to MK now to run with it. Talbot knows this
7391 2018-12-18 13:47:52 some are made with steel which are not anti-dust and if there's no zero maintenance the same is with cars. you need oil to clean it and make it more efficient
7392 2018-12-18 13:47:41 The Pulse might make fewer stops, but it makes all the stops and this sales pitch that it would be faster was snake oil. Traffic is traffic.
7393 2018-12-18 13:47:40 Never said where from did I. I said foriegn,  meaning not Canada. A pipeline would make transport of oil so much safer than rail, and more efficient.
7394 2018-12-18 13:47:38 So this will be another Labor , 'Education Revolution', Computers, Asian Languages and Doctorates for Everybody....You tried that in '07, it was a monumental failure!. 
 Bring back Ruddsey, he could sell the snake oil!.
7395 2018-12-18 13:47:20 How do the various 
Critters of TRUMPSWAMP rank 
in terms of most/serious ethics violations? Does Commerce Secretary Ross, as an example, get higher vote because his ships transported oil in arrangement with Putin's daughter?
7396 2018-12-18 13:47:13 He also says pointing to CEOs being predominantly male is beside the point. 99.9% of men can't be CEOs either. 

He is adamantly pro equality of opportunity, but adamantly against 50/50 quotas. Should women be forced to be plumbers, oil rig technicians, combat troops?
7397 2018-12-18 13:47:13 Looks like $AAPL, $GOOGL, and $AMZN being used to prop up markets.  Oil falling off so worth watching for the bid it usually catches around here. Currencies not indicating major risk on yet.

7415 2018-12-18 13:45:31 Instead of divesting from oil and investing in a green energy future, this government is doubling down on its party's biggest donors. #scam #workersunite
7416 2018-12-18 13:45:22 So. If activists target a big oil company for polluting and hiding data, this firm would rat out their “malign” activities? Got it.

7433 2018-12-18 13:43:13 You pay the least taxes of all Canada, the cheapest fuel.
Shaaadup! Money revenue is from oil.  Last time I checked, no land owner owns whats in the ground under their property. Its Canada's!
7434 2018-12-18 13:42:46 I feel like we’ve seen this movie very, very recently! They need to put you on a plane to HTX so you can chat with the oil and gas folks about their hedges and 2019 capex plans. I’m sure there’s some scrambling going on in CFO offices all around the Galleria, etc.

7449 2018-12-18 13:41:34 Sadly, they can’t

The world reserve currency (USD) when taken off the gold standard by Nixon the US made a deal with SA. All oil from SA must be sold in USD in exchange for border protection

The world reserve currency is tied to Saudi Oil = The Petro Dollar

7465 2018-12-18 13:40:05 It's easy to lose track of the real world, such as (from @McKinsey energy update) 1) Mexico eyes 50% boost in oil and gas output by 2024 & 2) Mexico plans to construct USD8-billion refinery around March 2019, despite refineries operating at lowest utilization in three decades.
7466 2018-12-18 13:40:00 No, I hadn't heard about the Muslim families being separated in China, but I looked it up. The world has gone mad. It's too bad for the people there that the land has oil. Chinese govt will use any excuse to control the people b/c of the oil.

7475 2018-12-18 13:39:20 Michelle talks about how Harper was for everyone. What about Nova Scotia? You screwed us on our oil and gas revenues (Atlantic Accord) and then kicked our MP  Bill Casey out of caucus for voting against it, as his constituents wanted. So much historical revisionism from the CPC.
7476 2018-12-18 13:39:18 Feds to announce help for oil producers Tuesday Refine your oil in Canada and stop getting rippedof by usa.
7477 2018-12-18 13:39:16 Similar in age and tonnage to the SD14's I was on in my youth - yep, fuel oil tanks are down on the bottom of the hull.
7478 2018-12-18 13:39:13 Good news… they are worrying about... bad news...we still need oil to build EVs..

7484 2018-12-18 13:38:41 We need to find what we can sell to the world (thats not oil) for that we need to be able to earn our way out of poverty. Not all these consume what you produce nonsense. Increasing worker productivity is the only way to go.
7485 2018-12-18 13:38:34 Fall crude oil prices, good news for consumers, and transportation companies. Bad news for oil companies,,likely lay offs, and rigs shut down. Saudi's likely worried,,major projects dependent upon higher prices, and Russia economy tied to crude oil prices.
7486 2018-12-18 13:38:33 Great. My first act as the new The Authority would be to cancel all further shows in Saudi Arabia and stop taking blood money from oil Royals.

Once that’s done, #RAW will be saved.

7488 2018-12-18 13:38:23 how much of this is just oil prices?
7489 2018-12-18 13:38:18 Lady at the place I’m getting my oil changed: What kind of car?

Me: Gray Prius.

Lady: I think there are a couple of those in the lot. Can you be more specific?

Me: Mine’s the one with the Richard Nixon poster in the backseat.

7491 2018-12-18 13:38:12 Yes, because oil prices went down and because businesses cut their profits. Businesses will not be able to afford to cut costs for much longer if they don't want to go bust.
7492 2018-12-18 13:38:06 not including oil and gas, Scotland sold £50.5bn in goods and services to the rest of the UK in 2013. The rest of the UK sold £62.7bn in goods and services to Scotland. BBC report 26th Aug 2014 ...RUK needs Scotland for trade

7500 2018-12-18 13:37:38 "Remain an attractive market" That's rich - considering you've done everything possible to demonize and destroy the Cdn oil industry. Smart investors won't touch the AB renewables market - driven by gov't subsidies and crony capitalism

7502 2018-12-18 13:37:37 Your history is somewhat right, in that Hitler’s far right extremism came in direct response the the extremism of the unions and his hatred of them.  Sadly many honest hardworking people like those in the Alberta oil patch get caught in the middle of the extremism fight.

7505 2018-12-18 13:37:15 Maybe we should have been using the mass of oil money to invest in diversification options?
This is just a tired argument from a petulant conservative flock who can't seem to see how warped their party has become.
7506 2018-12-18 13:37:15 The libs focus on his spelling, the rest of us focus on Jon creation, oil independence & exporting it,no misses from N Korea, fair trade, vets can go to own Dr, prison reform, safe borders,keeping drugs out of US. Trump is a business genius with guts & grit.
7507 2018-12-18 13:37:14 My thoughts..the US do need the oil & riyals as proclaimed vociferously by the trump cretin in the murder of Kashoggi when asked why he sides with MSM.

7509 2018-12-18 13:36:53 It’s probably all that shit they dumped on the oil to sink it to the bottom.
7510 2018-12-18 13:36:52 Also Scotland is net exporter while England is net importer. They only need us for our balance of payments numbers and our oil!

7515 2018-12-18 13:36:34 At least when some future Tory leader cites the financial crisis to some future Labour leader as a sign that Labour is bad economically, we can point out Tory cabinet ministers thought setting fire to the economy and pushing it off a cliff into a sea of oil was viable for Brexit.

7517 2018-12-18 13:36:15 Much of that wealth comes from his wife who inherited a blind trust worth between $1 and $5 million and owns an interest in an array of oil and gas, mineral and timber leases. He has done very little to help working Americans

7521 2018-12-18 13:35:42 Why do we allow inbound oil tanker traffic on the environmentally sensitive St Lawrence Seaway yet ban it on the west coast?

7523 2018-12-18 13:35:39 Chai. But they were both caught ‘oil handed’ 
7524 2018-12-18 13:35:34 Gaddafi projects biasedly served his family/cronies and not the people. It's then population was paltry 6 million and as an oil rent state it's easy to provide free basic medical care and education.  Libya is now in turmoil and struggling to find peace, but eventually it will.
7525 2018-12-18 13:35:33 Rather than invest that money in the oil industry, better to use it to study how to diversify the economy in Alberta. Fossil fuels are on their way out. Better to find another cash cow.
7526 2018-12-18 13:35:23 Am I the only who doesn’t rate Coconut oil for my hair? It completely kills my coils and the moisture doesn’t last grand.
7527 2018-12-18 13:35:22 I'm so thankful we have a pellet stove, I don't know what we'd do without it. This is the second time our furnace has refused to turn on and we just got oil last week

7589 2018-12-18 13:28:05 "oil is even worst for electricity than coal. It is very inefficient."

If efficiency is your judgemental criteria, no solar pv would ever be used.

In addition, above a panel temperature of 25°C their efficiency is ~*inversely* proportional to the solar irradiance they receive.

7600 2018-12-18 13:27:25 Trudeau doesn't know how to justify his huge failure.. We need our Pipelines and Independence and NOT to give billions of dollars to the Arabs, buying oil we don't need and THEN, give up a deal with them, which gave us some billions dollars back??? This Government has to end, NOW
7601 2018-12-18 13:27:21 So it’s sometimes difficult to keep track of the reason why the terrorist group the #LNA is fighting against #Libya-ns. Is it because all Libyans except mass murderer #Haftar & his gangsters are supposedly terrorists, or because Haftar doesn’t recognize GNA, or because of oil?

7610 2018-12-18 13:26:32 SA couldn’t care less about Canada as we continue to enrich this country by buying their oil. Our oil struggles to go East or West. The facts of this arms deal are largely unknown to the public but it shouldn’t be this difficult to determine liability and release an analysis.
7611 2018-12-18 13:26:23 December is showing the worst market numbers since the Great Depression, and you STILL want to try and sell your snake oil story of how "great the market is doing"? Numbers don't lie. Just like those who are flipping against you and the collusion that occurred to get you elected.
7612 2018-12-18 13:26:20 You too can work for #SammonsFinancialGroup supplying oil and gas fields across the globe and you too can help destroy the planet. :)
7613 2018-12-18 13:26:14 $5 Billion Federal Fuel Tax hike with a B on all OPECK OIL BARON COUNTRIES is long overdue and will pay for all the United States infrastructure, as well as, the payroll tax hike also. @NancyPelosi @WhipHoyer @GOPLeader @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SenSchumer @FoxNews

7615 2018-12-18 13:26:05 I swear the only thing that helps my anxiety in the morning is CBD oil. And it’s works like immediately so I don’t have to wait for anything to kick in. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive for a bottle 
7616 2018-12-18 13:26:03 I need the oil,  thanks so much :)
7617 2018-12-18 13:26:03 Wtf! This is crazy! There's a #UK firm making plant that turns any plastics back into it's raw material... OIL!! #wato
7618 2018-12-18 13:26:02 A5: I am trying to find on the web a recipe I am using from her book but can’t find it. This one comes close even though it uses veggie oil instead of a mix of coconut oil and vegan butter that I typically use. Best of luck!! Let me know how it goes! 
7619 2018-12-18 13:26:01 WOMENS SHAMPOO: European, Himalayan, Jamaican, Brazilian, rehabbing, revamping, reamping, glamping, volumizing, flattening, tetri oil, flaxseed oil, essential oil, color stay, color away, hydrating formula.

7622 2018-12-18 13:25:53 Iya, aku pakai Viva kok buat bersihin tas kulit. Hasilnya lebih OK dari mink oil/ balsam dan sejenisnya itu.
7623 2018-12-18 13:25:31 looks like it's a sort of oil spot underneath the screen. It's also visible when the device is turned off
7624 2018-12-18 13:25:25 Looked at it last night and their next B2B is in late Jan and they only have four total left on their schedule. If Koskinen continues to play well, my guess is we see a 3-1 or 4-1 ratio in his favour...unless, of course, his road numbers become an actual thing.
7625 2018-12-18 13:25:18 They should also be conditioning their chest hair thrice daily with a coconut oil & salt scrub.
7626 2018-12-18 13:25:13 Can anyone recommend good Americana accounts on IG? Cars, aluminium kitchens, signage, that sort of thing? The # doesn’t work well, loads of people covered in oil and not many clothes.

7628 2018-12-18 13:25:07 Application is still on going for spring 2019 session.
Earning a degree is as valuable as discovering crude oil in your compound or raw gold on your farmland because that's your own crude oil/gold on your palms.
7629 2018-12-18 13:25:00 Have you tried CBD oil? 
7630 2018-12-18 13:25:00 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

7634 2018-12-18 13:24:44 Trudeaus condition for this 1.6 billion is that Albertans pass a values test, stop wearing yellow vests and shut up about Liberals killing the oil sector, then kneel down and kiss his majesty’s ring,
7635 2018-12-18 13:24:42 This is pure oil-paper speculation that moves oil now. The real demand for oil is strong with China at ATH imports, when the new Saudi/Opec/ Russia reductions kicking in we will probably see +80$ pretty soon.
7636 2018-12-18 13:24:31 Glenn, please stop giving this snake oil salesman’s false, dogmatic, gaslighting verbiage any more oxygen. 

I’m baffled @ this tweet.  Might want to look into JBP & what he’s all about before you try to tell your followers he’s got a speck of integrity- spoiler: he doesn’t.
7637 2018-12-18 13:24:28 Leonardo Jardim, we need somebody who knows how to beat oil money and who can deliver with a moderate budget that is being provided by the Glazers.

7639 2018-12-18 13:24:19 Where is this announcement as this was from March 'Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has suggested that he would order a broad review of North Sea oil and gas taxes if he becomes the next UK prime minister, with changes to be focused on boosting jobs, skills and investment.'

7642 2018-12-18 13:23:40 The Petroleum Production Act 1934 ( Great Britain) that reserved oil exclusively for the Crown. It was marketed to the colonies. This concept of ownership is colonial as Mwenda referenced earlier
7643 2018-12-18 13:23:39 So with all the money made by the oil industry in Canada, they didn’t think it necessary to invest in infrastructure ... why? Because they know that they can get the govt to do that for them... wish I could act irresponsibly knowing that someone else will always p/u the bill.
7644 2018-12-18 13:23:35 Would the oil delivery man appreciate a faux fur?

7648 2018-12-18 13:23:20 I sometimes put coconut oil in my coffee, but I always had it with white sugar. I'm intrigued by pairing it with brown sugar. Hmmmmmm….
7649 2018-12-18 13:23:18 I think they need to be able to say they'll have a system in place more than they need a system in place. Snake oil salesman have great contract lawyers and are well compensated.

7653 2018-12-18 13:22:49 I hear you! My face has had so much skin cancer scraped off it looks like the surface of the moon. But you’ll never hear me whine. Unlike my daughter Celia, who borrowed my Volvo# “for a few hours” and returned it a week later. She whined that the oil was low. She’s 52 and unwed.

7658 2018-12-18 13:22:26 2 months ago- obama takes credit for a soaring economy and the oil boom.

Today- December has the worst stock market since the great depression. Trumps economic decisions finally caught up.

You can't just say when economy is good its obama and when it's bad its trump.
7659 2018-12-18 13:22:23 I’d love to try the High Cannibis Facial Oil.  I feel the anti-inflammatory properties of this oil would help my skin have a more youthful appearance!

7665 2018-12-18 13:21:24 It is equivalent to 3 - 4 % non oil GDP.  Is this close to the average in the region?

7672 2018-12-18 13:21:01 What else would one expect the bloke to say? That the future of oil is bleak and their days are numbered? It's hs country's main export. Put up a brave face. Unless of course he's grossly misinformed

7675 2018-12-18 13:20:40 "Nope, I want oil and coal gone."

Can you assure readers you neither use or benefit from either?

You don't mention which country you tweet from, but there's a chance your tweets are distributed around the world courtesy of some oil- or coal-fired electricity generation.
7676 2018-12-18 13:20:30 The US has changed from a net oil importer into a net oil exporter. We should have refiners of capacity more than we can consume so to export refined oil. We should have pipelines to reach our domestic market and the world market.   We cannot let geopolitics landlock our economy.
7677 2018-12-18 13:20:29 Innocent kids  their dad is guilty, why would he have oil in his house?

7679 2018-12-18 13:20:16 We are planning a million Conservative March on BC to permanently change the political processes there. How much is that worth to Alberta and the oil patch?
7680 2018-12-18 13:20:14 Nows the time to think about ENDING the Federal Reserves destruction of our nation,lets print a NATIONAL currency with NO interest,Stop looting our country with foreign wars,use hemp to replace oil+gas products made in the USA,#NEWGREENDEAL!

7682 2018-12-18 13:20:12 Especially at this time of year we were glad to assist a North-East oil worker who needed cash between contracts to pay bills. He raised £3,000 on his Rolex watch.

7689 2018-12-18 13:19:33 If they want to pay more for the oil and gas and electricity and whisky...
7690 2018-12-18 13:19:30 In those Libertarian communities where money was suppressed, wages were paid in coupons, the scale being determined by the size of the family. Locally produced goods, if abundant, such as bread, wine, and olive oil, were distributed freely.
7691 2018-12-18 13:19:15 it will be interesting to see how long they kinda go back-and-forth until MK is taking three of four games. If Talbot has another bad game tonight, you could be looking at a 3-1 ratio and/or Talbot's primary usage being in BTBs

7701 2018-12-18 13:18:39 Alberta is now facing a problem of their own making. They have relied too heavily on the oil sands as the backbone of their economy and have ignored warnings to diversify or face the consequences. The rooster has now come home to roost.

7703 2018-12-18 13:18:21 Oh, while I’m using rational thought,  did Obama permit drilling for oil in our country or was it President Trump?  We are now producing our own oil and selling it to Europe!  
Please, silly little DemocRATS, spare us your dumb comments.
7704 2018-12-18 13:18:15 No worries, where can we collect our oil money? You did invest it like Norway didn't you? Also, where would you like us to put the Trident warheads?

7708 2018-12-18 13:17:50 LOL. Seriously though, what the hell? In their public facing documents big oil is all up in renewable energy. The Kentucky Coal Miner museum even uses solar power. It’s like these guys are the evil villains in a 1970s Disney feature.

Mine's cheaper though.

7724 2018-12-18 13:16:48 It was not paradise but it was better than what it is today, much better and there is nothing normal about an oil rich country. Not when America is involved.
7725 2018-12-18 13:16:35 OIL: Oil prices fell 4 percent, dropping for a third consecutive session as reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in global stock markets.
7726 2018-12-18 13:16:20 Waiting for an oil delivery and I’ve changed my outfit three times already because I don’t know what the oil man would like to see me in. Fashion is exhausting.
7727 2018-12-18 13:16:19 #OPEC and other large oil producers led by Russia agreed this month to resume cutting output as oil prices have plunged to less than $60 from more than $80 per barrel in October in a blow to many oil producing countries' coffers.

7735 2018-12-18 13:15:48 I know the feeling. Son has but allergy. Anything bought has to have list of ingredients scanned. Vegetable oil is no because it may contain a nut oil. Everything says "May contain nuts".

7738 2018-12-18 13:15:34 Rupee ended stronger against the US Dollar as Brent crude oil prices plunged by around 3%. Foreign banks' Dollar sales, likely for FPI inflows in gilts supported the sentiment. Also, some banks placed fresh short dollar bets. However, importers' dollar demand weighed on the unit.
7739 2018-12-18 13:15:31 Oil production from 7 major US shale basins is expected to surpass 8M bpd by the end of the year #EIA. The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer, with overall crude production climbing to a weekly record of 11.7 million bpd.

7744 2018-12-18 13:15:17 Government bond prices ended higher today as further fall in crude oil prices increased odds of a cut in interest rates by the RBI as soon as February. However, gains remained capped ahead of the MPC minutes and US FOMC outcome, due Wednesday.
7745 2018-12-18 13:15:16 And how about the oil which isn't refined in Quebec but is nevertheless consumed there? Seems like a pretty incomplete set of facts you've got there. I think there's a word for that.

7747 2018-12-18 13:15:12 Protein takes longer to digest, hence why it fills you up more. Our ancestors never really used excess amount of oil in their cooking it became a modern practice but some cultures use more oil than required

7749 2018-12-18 13:14:58 Indian equities ended higher today, extending gains for the sixth straight session. Sentiment got a lift from strength in the rupee and a sharp decline in global oil prices. But the gains were capped as global growth concerns weighed and participants took profit.
7750 2018-12-18 13:14:57 It's still chocolate yeah. Hey I still eat and like the cheap stuff, no front. But would I ever Boycott the quality? I don't purchase enough of it for me to deprive myself. And if there's no palm oil involved it's a good thing.
7751 2018-12-18 13:14:31 Went to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Didn’t know I spilled hair oil on the ground and ate shit. Tried to catch myself on the way down and screwed my wrist up in the process. Someone bubble wrap my life please. 
7752 2018-12-18 13:14:28 Libya's National Oil Company (NOC) has declared force majeure on operations at El Sharara oilfield, it said late on Monday, a week after the company declared force majeure on the field's exports.
7753 2018-12-18 13:14:20 poor optics in one sense — but does speak volumes that santos instigated a project that’s replacing oil with solar.
7754 2018-12-18 13:14:11 India's Reliance, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, and top oil exporter Saudi Arabia will explore joint investments in refining and petrochemicals in the two countries, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said.
7755 2018-12-18 13:14:03 despite US sanction, Israel been on-selling Iranian Oil to EU for decades, til the Mullahs put the kibosh on the underhand dealing with the duplicitous little gnomes. Perhaps Israel has a genuine fear of the Iranians after all they introduced Iran to WMDs and the Savak.
7756 2018-12-18 13:14:01 maybe but Libya was not paradise as you guys perceive. It was just a normal country rich in oil. Gaddafi developed a strong personality cult that makes people presume his prowess.
7757 2018-12-18 13:13:55 @vitaminwater I would build a castle for my dogs. Complete with oil paintings of other dogs, a video and photographic proof would absolutely exist. #nophoneforayear #contest #voteforme
7758 2018-12-18 13:13:54 I need an oil change 
7759 2018-12-18 13:13:54 Nobody is stopping the Francophones, if they wish to go solo. Go! But don't squandered the hard earned tax dollars of the hard working Canadians. Don't squandered Alberta's oil money from unfairly distribution of the equalization payment. Guess who was there in 1957? Trudeau Sr!
7760 2018-12-18 13:13:45 Pea pesto pasta. Put peas in the food processor with the basil, nuts, garlic, oil and cheese. Makes it sweet and a beautiful, fun color!!
7761 2018-12-18 13:13:44 Yes, standard stove grease. Burners may have grease or cooking oil residue. Stove lifts to expose area. I could take pictures tonight.
7762 2018-12-18 13:13:41 For a man who hedges future oil prices, he doesn't seem quite so keen on infrastructure forward-thinking.
7763 2018-12-18 13:13:19 Or, we could have both. Supply responsibly produced oil to the world, and create other jobs as well. But, that’s not the point right? Keep Alberta down, while the rest of the world pumps more. Great way to help the country.
7764 2018-12-18 13:13:17 It’s technically right ... oil pressed from milk
7765 2018-12-18 13:13:15 How about coconut oil instead of Ky?
7766 2018-12-18 13:13:13 Oil prices fell 4 percent today, for a third consecutive session, amid reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in global stock markets. (Reuters)

7780 2018-12-18 13:11:16 Hes paid by the oil cronies to press for the status quo, and imply everyone else is out for money.

7782 2018-12-18 13:11:06 I just draw in pencil and graphite and charcoal but when I painted I used acrylics. Honestly it depends on what type of look ur going for. Oil paints give a softer blended look whole acrylics give a more textured look

7792 2018-12-18 13:09:50 Nope. In 3 months from a cold start the most that could be delivered in a ready state would be a system of say 10 man-years worth of complexity. So a team of say 60 absolute tops so at most £8M cost with hosting & testing.

Any IT house that claims more is a seller of snake oil.

7838 2018-12-18 13:04:38 aaah i see. from what i heard, oil takes ages to dry sbsbsn. also, you might need some kind of a liquid( linseed oil i think) to apply to the canvas so it can blend the colours better.

Does burning of these products and their byproducts emit GHGs? Yes.

Ok, well we still need to check, just to be sure....

Oh, by the way did you fund climate denial ‘research’? Yes.

Just checking, we be back to you soon...

7856 2018-12-18 13:03:20 Have you ever wondered why America attacked Libya in the first place? America only cares about resources not people. They will only get out of there after they have gotten their last barrel of oil. From now on Lybia will either be a failed state or a puppet state.

7858 2018-12-18 13:03:11 They can only go into a county if they have support of the members who provide military support or they’d be killed. Clearly the Saudi oil is more important to some than actual lives. I don’t see any of the Christians in the US screaming and protesting... guess they need oil too!
7859 2018-12-18 13:03:11 As a big investor you also dont want to "kill it" if you want to monetize another big run.  When OPEC allowed oil to hit $150 it opened the door to solar, wind and US shale.  So you need to keep it on a lead to some degree

7865 2018-12-18 13:02:12 There are nearly 2000 articles on cannabis oil listed in Pubmed. There is plenty of research, and it is still ongoing. I can't even imagine how you could possibly be so deluded.
7866 2018-12-18 13:02:11 Have the Liberals gone mad! First they kick the AB oil industry where it hurts,now they offer a token payment so that we will think they are good guys and vote for them.Albertans are smarter than that. BTW it will be paid out at the same speed TMX approved.
7867 2018-12-18 13:02:00 Currently, hydropower facilities in the United States can generate as much hydropower to supply electricity to 28 million households, which is equivalent to about 500 million barrels of oil.  #TriviaTuesday

7874 2018-12-18 13:01:12 Trump tactics to bring oil price down is going to hurt E&P companies in the short run and affect oil supply in the long run. There is no way to bring Iranian oil export down even by 50% let alone 100%.
7875 2018-12-18 13:00:56 1. More worried about the stock market. 2.our gas is $1.77 a gallon in Columbus. It’s down to $48 a barrel of oil today.  3. Trump and I will say the same, “ you better tweet or call the Ohio State Attorney General”. 
7876 2018-12-18 13:00:55 Your analogy is flawed. A tank has the ability to turn 180* nearly on a dime. Use an oil tanker as an example perhaps

7880 2018-12-18 13:00:45 Last time oil price per barrel was this low, gas was 1.23 a gallon! So the oil industry is still stealing our money, right down to the retailers

7884 2018-12-18 13:00:26 Many thanks goes to Mourinho for the trophies and 2nd position after a year. Now the club must be smart and appoint Jardim who believes in United way i.e., promoting youth and he had beaten the Oil rich Psg to ligue1, although Pochetttino is great but that's unlikely.

7886 2018-12-18 13:00:15 My tattoo itching decreased tremendously when I changed Tattoo Goo to coconut oil. Apparently Tattoo Goo does give me some sort of allergic reaction or it's not strong enough for my super dry skin. 
I have to try other lotion for the first 2-3 days the next time.
7887 2018-12-18 13:00:14 On the other hand, with no African theater, given that the UK was defeated, the Germans would have been able to march onto the Middle East unopposed and seize its oil. They may have then march up through the Caucasus from there.
7888 2018-12-18 13:00:13 Price will probably drop to around 8-12 dollars. Saudi Arabia is producing oil for a cost of 6 dollars a barrel.

7890 2018-12-18 12:59:53 There are ways to get our vaccine toxicity from the body. One way to get out the mmr is soaking leaves of a croton plant in olive oil then applying it on the spine. A rash will appear as the body pushes it out.

7893 2018-12-18 12:59:37 Actually five.. forgot the olive oil! It was very hot!
7894 2018-12-18 12:59:32 everything I know I learned from @karintanabe, but some favorites include: DHC Deep Cleansing Oil, COSRX everything, snail everything, and the AMOREPACIFIC_US color control cushion compact, which is MAGIC and makes skin look positively dewy.
7895 2018-12-18 12:59:12 Alberta had DECADES to build a robust economy that didn't suffer from boom/bust cycles of oil prices. Albertan Cons KNEW that eventually oil prices would drop eventually, but did nothing to promote other industries. They just cut taxes and rode the boom.
7896 2018-12-18 12:59:11 China now has: 
-2 million passenger #EVs on the road #EV 
-400,000 #e-buses 
~5 million low speed #electricvehicles 
-150 million #electric two-wheelers
Oil demand growth in #China will be lower than many expect. @colinmckerrache @BloombergNEF
7897 2018-12-18 12:58:53 My guess is that this is the passive aggressive way to tax fossil fuels since the @GOP can’t do it up front, to the oil and gas co’s. Maybe it will encourage people to use public transit?
7898 2018-12-18 12:58:48 oil stocks taking a beating in general i think.
7899 2018-12-18 12:58:31 CO2 is necessary for plants, yes. Plants absorbed excess CO2 from Earth’s ancient, hot, toxic-to-humans atmosphere millions of years ago....this became coal, oil, gas. Now we are releasing it into the air again. All plants die in excessive heat.
7900 2018-12-18 12:58:29 Time for a fuckin oil change
7901 2018-12-18 12:58:23 We'd get diatribes about how NASA did go to the moon, but as part of an imperialistic neo-liberal invasion oppressing the self determination of lunar people whose real purpose was to control the satellite oil supply.
7902 2018-12-18 12:58:22 @MaajidNawaz pays lip service to recycling. 
He supports EU who supports Corporates who support Oil products/plastics! 

He was surprised that plastic came from oil! 

This is the standard of @global #LBC ... "journalists"!

LBC pays big for Corporate puppets on 1yr contract.
7903 2018-12-18 12:58:16 Oil&Gas companies, along with IEA are underestimating the impact of renewables, EVs and other electrical devices. They know that once markets understand that oil&gas resources will not be fully utlilised, the price of the products will fall to production cost +20% margin.
7904 2018-12-18 12:58:00 Canadians should be proud and not fighting against each other. We should use oil and gas revenues to develop alternative energy. Canada can be an energy powerhouse on all fronts. But now we rather hate each other. It’s sickening.

7907 2018-12-18 12:57:44 Literally the most bizarre thing I’ve read today.  Is Mr. Twitter erasing what you wrote while you type it?  How did the auto industry invade this tweet.  Are you a “car” guy because you know how to change oil and think it makes you qualified to advise the industry?

7913 2018-12-18 12:56:46 Greek energy exploration and production company Energean Oil & Gas signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel Natural Gas Lines (INGL). Energean will receive $98 million from INGL to construct gas infrastructure near shore region of natural gas facilities in #Israel.
7914 2018-12-18 12:56:46 I am cycling everywhere, eating vegan, local produce, avoiding plastics, avoid palm oil, engaging in environment activism, avoid foreign holiday travel. So this year I want to get involved in taking climate cases against @opwireland & other companies that destroy the environment
7915 2018-12-18 12:56:40 A 730 oil change and you block traffic. What have you wrought?
7916 2018-12-18 12:56:27 And also keep the ears dirty ha! I have to put oil drops in  but I have scarring inside from being pretty much deaf as a kid so that’s making it worse.
Not sure if you have any ear ache with it too xx
7917 2018-12-18 12:56:18 Alberta oil and gas is responsibly produced and should be able to hit the global market. Replacing dictator oil with Canadian oil is a good thing. Why does no one see that ?
7918 2018-12-18 12:56:03 to help my hair, i wash it every 3-5 days. let the natural oil do what it’s supposed to do. when i wash it, i let the conditioner sit 5-10 mins. & to keep it soft and pretty, i use biosilk!! but u can build up the natural oils so ur hair isn’t greasy(took me a while)

7920 2018-12-18 12:55:57 He's a liar and a racist. He's a snake oil salesman who tricked young voters into voting for a candidate who is somehow more toxic than simply not voting at all. He caused irreparable damage to the Democratic party and helped put a fascist in office. #WhyIDontLikeBernieSanders
7921 2018-12-18 12:55:49 In 1969 oil was $3.00 per barrel, gasoline was $0.35 per gallon. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY!

7930 2018-12-18 12:54:36 Alberta pays by far the most in to confederation per capita. Oil and gas used to absolutely dwarf all industry in Canada. Profit was shared amongst the entire country. Keep our borrowed money in the bank and get out of our way already. #pipelines

Oil prices continued to fall on Tuesday, extending Monday’s losses amid persistent concerns over US supplies after reports that #Cushing, Oklahoma crude inventories rose by more than 1 million barrels from December 11th to 14th.

7942 2018-12-18 12:53:53 So what, I know it might be hard for you to comprehend but he is involved in that group and an advocate for nuclear power because he believes in it as a solution to global warming . It's not like he is advocating coal  or big oil companies or selling cigarettes to children.

7950 2018-12-18 12:53:13 Low key, I'm feeling this hipster energy. I feel like crushing a PBR can with my eco-responsible can crusher and explaining "my life has never been the same since Bush and his fascist war dogs pored Iraqi oil down America's throat."
7951 2018-12-18 12:52:51 Lol. I was simply stating that people have a right to critique groups they perceive to have power. This includes the Republican Party, the so-called “1%,” big oil, Democrats, the Vatican, or any number of other groups.
7952 2018-12-18 12:52:47 Lmao I’m hip. I’m pretty sure I burned it. I see the shiny black marks like burn marks so I use it once at night and a gentle cleanser in the Morning now since I also put Tamanu oil on which also has a tingly sensation to it but helps sooo much
7953 2018-12-18 12:52:40 The main reason is there is no substitute for oil

7994 2018-12-18 12:48:26 True,also because of Russia's close oil(russia' s biggest export) alliance with Saudi Arabia,now it can help stabilise oil market(an option russia did not had in 2008)thus help Russia avoid worst case scenario.

8006 2018-12-18 12:46:54 Klopp rejected Utd, Pep was booked by oil men long ago and Ancelotti isn’t quite a long-term solution IMHO. My wish is Pochettino as I see him as a great prospect, knows the league and with appropriate support by board and with new DoF could bring good times to Old Trafford

8016 2018-12-18 12:45:18 In a pinch I used coconut oil to remove my eye makeup and it’s now my favorite makeup remover! So gentle!

8018 2018-12-18 12:45:12 That moment when you nearly guillotine your toes.Yes toes...So many incidents today.. I think I'll change my name to The Clumsy Crafter.
And while I'm here I hate hardwax oil too. That is all. Rant over.
8019 2018-12-18 12:44:52 I can assure that no matter what JT does us “morons” will never vote for him!  It really must kill you to know your entire existence revolves around oil and gas, and their byproducts. Good luck without them bitch!
8020 2018-12-18 12:44:27 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift! No more lies! I won’t eat pie! I’d rather die! Or lose my eyes! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
8021 2018-12-18 12:44:09 @djfuckthecops Ever been so fucked up when mashing up tunes . and  look at back at what you played & think to yourself " WHAT The HELL was I  doing?Example: Pat Bennetar , Midnight Oil, NWA(BOYZ  In The HOOd, Lenny Dee/Rob Gee,Darryl Haul &Oats, random dub-step tune&The BANGLES
8022 2018-12-18 12:44:07 Received my order of Winter Oil this morning! I've not even peeked - its going straight under the tree  Thanks so much for the mask too!

8025 2018-12-18 12:43:20 I used my regular cleanser this morning and my skin felt tight + a slight burning sensation, even though I've used my cleanser forever. This is because of the Deriva. But when I use oil cleanser, my skin feels better. I have a thread on this in my drafts.
8026 2018-12-18 12:43:13 It's pretty impressive how quickly they were able to replace their peanut oil with it.
8027 2018-12-18 12:43:12 Man I wish somebody loved me enough to go get my oil changed for me. My car only a year old but I still get antsy .. cuz them mechanic niggas known to fuck a day up. Don’t fuck my holiday joy up..

8029 2018-12-18 12:42:52 And you’re absolutely wrong on your last half of that tweet, which is why EXPERTS (who make far less than the oil execs who you’re buying your BS from) insist climate change is real (100% consensus) and human caused (majority consensus).
8030 2018-12-18 12:42:43 Climate Barbie cures all snake oil!!
8031 2018-12-18 12:42:35 ONLY A GOVERNMENT CAN PRACTICE SUCH STUPID POLICIES........ FIRST THEY SHUT DOWN THE ENERGY SECTOR, NO MORE COAL, NO MORE FRACKING, NO MORE SHIPPING OF OIL....... NOW SPEND MONEY TO HELP THOSE WHO THEY TOOK OUT OF BUSINESS...... ALL IN NAME OF "TREE HUGERS"
8032 2018-12-18 12:42:26 I’ve also heard wonderful things about CBD oil and we happen to have a sister who owns her own business making CBD products 
8033 2018-12-18 12:42:15 The bamboobies nipple ointment is amazing! I showed my lactation consultant what I was using and she was very happy with the choice because new research is showing that extra virgin olive oil is the way to go with repairing your nips!
8034 2018-12-18 12:42:09 MARY CHRISTMAS. You are bless in your going out and in your coming in ,  I  have a massage for you The joy of the Lord is your strength,  he  made me to free your hart , by you knowing his  plan for you.... you are in connection with the Lord , and his oil will be on you.
8035 2018-12-18 12:42:09 “Speed of increase”. You know, like “mass of weight” or “energy of oil.”
8036 2018-12-18 12:42:06 When we war over oil, we'd all better start dressing like the tin man
8037 2018-12-18 12:42:02 The zoo do amazing work and I support in every way I can, especially to help Chester become palm oil free. Going to Sumatra to support rainforest treeplanting and orangutan research and radio tracking. Best wishes to all the staff at this difficult time.

8040 2018-12-18 12:41:42 butuh sheetmask, karna kesal kalo pake masker organik kalo nggak loreal yang extraordinary oil juga butuh rambutku bener bener gak terawat soalnya(iya ini efek males juga:")
8041 2018-12-18 12:41:31 This makes me mad. I had a taxi driver tell me that if I took black-seed oil and prayed to Allah I will be cured. We ended up shouting at each other and I didn't tip as I usually do. #FuckPrayerForChronicIllnesses

8045 2018-12-18 12:41:25 One thing that is keeping pressure on global stock benchmarks is the plunge in oil prices & doubts over how effective the implementation of the latest OPEC+ cuts will be & weak sentiment as global equities fall
8046 2018-12-18 12:41:21 Ya... this wont go over well. The West doesn't want handouts the West wants to work and to sell its oil on the world stage.  None of this money will help the workers, it will only help the executives. Every action this Government does just shows how out of touch it is.
8047 2018-12-18 12:41:18 I just use a drizzle of olive oil, by spice l meant heat.
8048 2018-12-18 12:41:12 #CBD oil & extract has been amazing for me over the past few years, but it's still so misunderstood. CBD has been proven to provide benefits for those with neurological disorders as well as many other issues. It's been my livesaver!

8053 2018-12-18 12:40:49 I hate getting my oil changed, or any car maintenance at all 
8054 2018-12-18 12:40:44 30 years and no oil to power ships, that will make a decent dent!
8055 2018-12-18 12:40:31 Quid Pro Quo was seen from day one when Trump ORDERED his staff to find a way to vacate sanctions against Russia.  8-10 Trillion $ worth of oil was what Russia was sitting on, but couldn't extract it without U.S. Oil Companies help.  Only Sanctions were standing in the way!

8064 2018-12-18 12:40:04 @CNN The primary reason US military forces are in Afghanistan is to protect the lucrative poppy-fields! Have read that American troops "patrol" and protect harvests and sell some of it for extra money! True, or not true? Drugs and oil make the world go 'round. We all know that.
8065 2018-12-18 12:40:01 The least greasiest serums that assist during a straighten are John Frieda frizz ease or extraordinary oil from L’Oréal

8071 2018-12-18 12:39:17 I am in favour of having food prices the way oil prices fluctuate.  Let there be survival of the fittest. If middle class can spend 1000s on movies and pizza they can cut down that and spent on food and vegetables .  But waiver is not a solution.
8072 2018-12-18 12:39:13 Oil prices fell 4 percent on Tuesday after reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in stock markets as the outlook for global growth deteriorated.

8082 2018-12-18 12:38:29 No. Not oil and gas. I am NOT touching that space.  That is complete dog shit. I would not touch.  I am into a couple of illiquid situations.  All will be revealed after I am long. 
8083 2018-12-18 12:38:28 The mission where Eagle Flies asks you to get into the oil refinery; parkoured up the building and went to the window he'd pointed at. Failed when I got to to the window.

8093 2018-12-18 12:36:52 I think it is hard to call it small material assistance when almost half  of Allied munitions, coal, and crude oil were from the US. The USSR definitely  did the fighting, but the US supplied the war.

8100 2018-12-18 12:36:16 Feels like we just need to hit 2400 (50% retracement from 1850 lows in Jan 2016 & recent highs. Then people feel like they didn’t “miss out” and valuation will be attractive vs just average now (as long as oil doesn’t crash which weighs on earnings).

8103 2018-12-18 12:36:07 i think whatever we do we need to make some serious sacrifices as a society. We cant claim to want to save the environment but keep doing things thats deadly to the environment. At this point we need to evaluate all of our behavior, diet, oil, platstics, vehicles, etc...

8105 2018-12-18 12:35:56 Because the other thing that happens -- we no longer have to fight wars for oil -- so it becomes increasingly hard to justify out of control military budgets.

8129 2018-12-18 12:32:09 2) be sure chefs always change the oil they cook your food in.If they cook your food in the same frying oil as the seafood, u can still get food poisoning or have an allergic reaction. I learned that from experience.  But I’m so glad your ok!  Also, always keep an inhaler as well
8130 2018-12-18 12:31:55 Haha. You've got to look at woodward and glazer mate. They're the problem. Jose and Louis won major trophies when they were there. Once we get our oil money takeover like you lot we'll be back

8133 2018-12-18 12:31:37 I'm not bullish on the oil narrative right now. Not even with a pipeline. 

A part of the Trump stimulus plan is driving oil prices lower. I'm also guessing arresting Meng is going to have oil buying consequences for Canada.
8134 2018-12-18 12:31:26 If people want to save animals, gain inner peace, and help save the planet, they go vegan.

If people want to be their healthiest and reverse disease, they eat a whole plant based no oil diet.

Either one is amazing and catalyzes a profound positive revolution within the self.
8135 2018-12-18 12:31:24 U.S. oil futures plunge to a new 15-month low Tuesday,dropping 3.5% to below $49 per barrel due to concerns over excess oil supplies & a weaker global economy.

8146 2018-12-18 12:30:02 What annoys me @MaajidNawaz is ppl moaning at fossil fuels.
Crude oil is a long chain hydrocarbon, & unlocking these chains in the refinery provides all sorts of fuels , solvents & ashphalt for roads, Propane & LPG heat a majority of homes in the UK.
Do ppl wanna freeze to death?

8152 2018-12-18 12:29:42 You need to worry about this economy instead of Muller investigations. Your economy is tanking and if you think lower oil prices will work, your wrong. Hire an economist that knows. i havent heard anyone complain about high gas prices in several years.

8156 2018-12-18 12:29:33 I’m willing to bet that it’s far less than that. The little amount of yellowing on the winshield washer tank (not radiator expansion in black above) indicates that it’s affected by age & not engine bay heat. If it was heat, it would’ve been as yellow as the SLS oil tank beside it

8209 2018-12-18 12:22:55 Many thanks @NFAUG, it's good clarification and only those with data to prove otherwise can dispute this fact. Oil palm business is closely followed by many stakeholders and encroachment on CFRs is not part of VODP's plans.

8212 2018-12-18 12:22:01 Exactly! They just make people feel rich so they will oil the economy taking on more debt load and spending more in the economy. It's better to have one than not have one I suppose but it is paper wealth at best unless you liquidate the asset and rent before you croak it.

8215 2018-12-18 12:21:35 It didn't help, that's true. But they made it far worse through a range of Econ policy blunders - price controls, expropriations, no diversification, oil revenue sent abroad, no maintenance of oil investments, foreign exchange controls, no inflation targeting... properly stupid.

8414 2018-12-18 11:59:54 Mixture of sunflower and olive oil. Key thing is to add the par-boiled and dried tatties to very hot oil - preheat the roasting pan in the oven and then put on the hob to keep the oil hot when you add the tatties.
8415 2018-12-18 11:59:51 Are they all bribed by the oil and old car industry ?

8420 2018-12-18 11:59:12 17.4 million people voted to leave and just want to leave!! It's biased eu funded media who want snake oil so they have something to rally against!!!

17.4 million people would pour snake oil down the bog!!!
8421 2018-12-18 11:59:01 Funnily enough the oil is still worthless and still about to run out. Wonder how WM will manage when we reclaim this awful burden from them #DissolveTheUnion #Indyref2
8422 2018-12-18 11:58:37 I'd rather the government give my tax money to the poor family in the city with parents who work multiple jobs and have to rely on donations than an oil company or GE your other larger corporations.
8423 2018-12-18 11:58:23 Oil straight down to 48. Guess all those “significant” production cuts aren’t working.

What now OPEC?
8424 2018-12-18 11:58:15 This is that kind of weather that after you take your shower you gotta mix your lotion with baby oil so that when you get home after your day is over you don’t look like you been crawling on your hands, knees & elbows all day! 
8425 2018-12-18 11:58:06 sana oil!!!
8426 2018-12-18 11:57:59 OMG is there really palm oil in that also??

8437 2018-12-18 11:57:13 We have videos, we also have their confessional statements, we have them captured spilling oil on my Client's car. We are therefore appalled at the plan to turn them into the victims. Like I said, we shall meet in court.
8438 2018-12-18 11:57:13 Everyone should take a moment at this time of year to think of those less fortunate, like people who's Toyota aygos turn into oil tankers when trying to reverse in car parks

8443 2018-12-18 11:56:31 The reason we're entering a new golden age of boxing is because we've got former champions like @OscarDeLaHoya still in the game. He's the oil running the boxing engine.

8445 2018-12-18 11:56:05 She is advocating more for an industry change in what is produced by companies and what companies run on (i.e. Windmills and Solar panels rather than oil and gas).  Not what car you as an individual drive.  You do you, but the earth is getting warmer and we need to act now.
8446 2018-12-18 11:55:44 Within this last week Donald Trump has proven that he's trying to bring us back to the 1950s with increasing coal and oil extraction from the earth he's trying to pollute the cities and states again as he makes millions with his tax cut for billionaires

8451 2018-12-18 11:54:11 Is that like, we'll see commercial BEV routes in 5 years with current economics? Or that technically we could, but we need to see higher oil/carbon taxes or something to make it viable?

8453 2018-12-18 11:53:58 At $10 per barrel, virtually no one is going to be producing. Do you really see mass bankruptcies in the global oil sector? Particularly US shale.
8454 2018-12-18 11:53:54 The idiot is YOU - we were discussing Energy East.
And it is the TAR Sands, & there is NO such things as "Ethical Oil" Ezra!

8461 2018-12-18 11:53:02 So long as the demand for snake oil exists, there is always going to be someone ready to supply it.

8476 2018-12-18 11:50:03 I love how well you speak the truth! When Obama was President, he wanted to shut down oil companies. He claimed that producing oil in this country hurt the environment.

8480 2018-12-18 11:49:03 Meh. Reagan talked tough, but it was all a ploy to get Gorbachev to the bargaining table. (Trump is trying to emulate that with North Korea. YMMV on if it's working.) The last thing Reagan wanted was nuclear war.

P.S. the cheaper oil is, the broker Russia gets.

8486 2018-12-18 11:48:22 In all seriousness, par boiling them the day before and keeping them sealed in the fridge works best. The drier they are before roasting the crispier they'll be. Rice bran oil has a nice high smoke point.

8488 2018-12-18 11:48:15 True but nobody expected us to get anywhere with that team. But the sum of our parts is greater than the individuals. Unlucky for Klopp that he's managing against an oil rich club with Pep at the helm.
8489 2018-12-18 11:48:05 He is the father of 5 children by 3 different women and only God knows how many others whom he has paid off. He doesn’t take a salary, but he’s costing us a fortune in travel with Secret Service for him and his kids. He likes ordinary folks just like any other snake oil salesman.
8490 2018-12-18 11:48:04 It is very easy to make. You either roast them in the oven or get them roasted and grind them and if it is not paste-y enough u add vegetable oil. The downside is that it produces little quantity while peanuts are not that cheap
8491 2018-12-18 11:47:58 I assure you that we are committed to giving you a great value offer on fuel in all of our filling stations. Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. TY - Shauny 2/2

8495 2018-12-18 11:47:48 As smallholders produce 40% of palm oil it's imperative the industry empowers and engages with them. This includes working with farmers who have suitable land but also with groups and individuals to increase education, training and awareness of sustainable practices.

8498 2018-12-18 11:47:38 We are a fossil fuel civilization. 25 years ago 90% of the worlds global energy came from fossil fuels. Today after billions of dollars  in subsidies for renewables  it’s still 87%. Without the power density the oil sands provide we will never be able to transition to renewables!
8499 2018-12-18 11:47:10 Based on experience and prevalent culture, the police forced them to "confess" to the crime and rubbed the oil on them to make it credible enough. The circumstancial evidence is tainted. Dear Distinguished, allow me to hold your brief.

8534 2018-12-18 11:41:48 This is where the foreign money exposed by @FairQuestions, with links to politicians like Butts in Trudeaus office get really problematic. Foreign oil is completely unopposed. While CDN oil is being shut down, this isn't a coincidence IMO.
8535 2018-12-18 11:41:34 Okkk Mr. Luxury I see you loll also so proud of you for putting oil in your hair. I’m expecting snoop-esq photos to be sent with this new flourish thankkk you so much 
8536 2018-12-18 11:41:34 The manipulating of oil prices is a conspiracy between trump, Saudi, and Russia. . . and I'm sure trump is being handsomely paid for his puppet role. Anything for a buck, you know.
8537 2018-12-18 11:41:33 Exactly what I call a grand hypocrisy.

8550 2018-12-18 11:40:26 That’s the point I’m trying to make, just because they gave odds of 100% given last performance the R1/r3 result was a success. Clearly loads of stale bulls always planned to exit on the oil strike to reduce risk.
8551 2018-12-18 11:40:22 Thank you for swift reply. When I’ve checked the labelling there is nothing to indicate that the palm oil is responsibly sourced - just want to check I can use any of these supermarkets’ mincemeat with a clear conscience? #Orangutans #rspo

8575 2018-12-18 11:36:56 Wait until you find out about the part Labour played in keeping oil off the Clyde , which would have led to one of the lowest paid highest unemployment levels in Scotland being the Aberdeen of the South.

Its pure self loathing Sectarianism keeping Lab elected in Ayrshire.
8576 2018-12-18 11:36:56 Even with Banker, there was always question about hitting the oil due to continual issues arising when drilling. I think this is success for the company and if they hit further oil will validate the management team. Just needs to flow commercial and no more shitty drawdown/errors
8577 2018-12-18 11:36:52 Soothing the Alberta oil economy dilemma with due process is akin to offering #ColdTurkey to a heroin addict

8593 2018-12-18 11:33:20 Fuel subsidy payments stopped in 2016 on increase of pump price to ₦143
But increase in global oil prices & exchange rate increased landing costs again. So a different mode for undercovery was introduced by the FG. Landing cost today is almost ₦200. His claims are right.

8607 2018-12-18 11:30:07 Has Trudeau not done enough damage to Canadian businesses that now he has to interfere with deals made before he was even elected, Canada buys about 300 million a month of oil from the Saudis but wants to cancel the armored vehicle deal. Liberal logic at it's finest.
8608 2018-12-18 11:30:02 Did you ever solve the boots problem? I meant to suggest cleaning them with saddle-soap or a good traditional polish. You could also try rubbing in a strongly scented oil that you like, walnut, linseed etc..

If there is still a traditional cobbler near you, ask them for advice.

oil?
8611 2018-12-18 11:29:07 Focusing only on the economics it also makes sense to wait & see after the December hike.

In the short run oil price fall prevents any inflation overshoot, Quantitative Tightening continuing & lagged effects of past rises = monetary policy still tightening.

war.
8616 2018-12-18 11:28:42 So what do you think will happen if we #DissolveTheUKUnion and declare Indy? 
That they’ll close the banks. Stop DWP payments? Stop deliveries to Scotland by closing the border. Send in troops. Declare martial law in Scotland? Take over the oil rigs?
8617 2018-12-18 11:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

8620 2018-12-18 11:28:13 You could argue that hitting oil at R1-R3 was a success even though it was a “banker”, I don’t think too many would have been shocked had it not hit oil given delivery by the co to date, especially on the workovers. Sad it’s at this price but i would love a big djeno/ mengo hit

8624 2018-12-18 11:27:21 Give it a rest. The rhetoric is palpable. You want more oil to be sold because you have a vested financial interest. We get it. There is nothing wrong with that. But please stop wrapping it in this nationalist agenda of what is good for Canada.

8641 2018-12-18 11:25:10 The consumption market of 80 million people, which has #oil money, is definitely attractive to the west.

8642 2018-12-18 11:24:52 BTW: Sturgeon has better be careful with her oil argument: England has oil reserves under Sherwood Forest, & it’s a very high quality too! If it was there in 1940, it’s still there now.

8653 2018-12-18 11:23:49 That's how you get the price of oil to go up. Tell oil traders the supply is decreasing .
8654 2018-12-18 11:23:40 Oil heading for low 40's then likely a nice bounce back to mid 50's before the big decline to $10 later in 2019. The Fed needs to wake up & realize that deflation is the overriding risk not inflation.
8655 2018-12-18 11:23:21 Money flowing back into #AAOG manipulation here, ignore the noise. The oil is there, hold for the big prize. Mengo & Djeno not priced in. Any news there and we will rocket. 20-30p still my target. Patience will pay.
8656 2018-12-18 11:23:17 There would have been modifications, not really one leader he wanted one currency for Africa, especially in trade , where oil and other African mineral resources will be purchased using real gold coin with more value than respective currency
8657 2018-12-18 11:23:15 Regardless of market performance, tariffs, oil prices and inflation/wages/housing data, the 2018 rate move up was just too big and too fast. The market couldn’t digest it and here we are.

8667 2018-12-18 11:21:46 Yeah fair enough. But don’t they generally have fossil fuels such as coal and oil to rely on? Plus we won’t be able to use fossil fuels.
8668 2018-12-18 11:21:44 I listen to ASMR videos (I do not have ASMR) and put a warm rice bag over my eyes. Also tea tree or orange oil on my temples (because it smells good! Aromatherapy isn't real.)
8669 2018-12-18 11:21:40 I'm imagining '70s style oil- crisis queues at petrol stations...public opinion might just start to swing...
8670 2018-12-18 11:21:34 Crude oil $WTIC $CL hitting lower lows breaks its reversal turn pattern potential off prior low. Still within the zone bounded by $45 at the bottom, $51.47 at top. The $47-$48 area likely to remain a contested range within the zone
8671 2018-12-18 11:21:20 Takes 2 weeks to hit the pumps. From oil to petrol fuel.  Also factor in £ being still fallen than 2 weeks ago.

8817 2018-12-18 11:01:21 No worries, might get ur book some time. I glad u mention disinflation in oil coz I believe it has already occurred for 20 years when u consider true rate of inflation for other common living expenses. I believe that, on that basis, gold has also fallen on par with electronics.

Sorry, this is underinformed:
There are over 5000 different oil plants, some growing either on desert-like soil or in mixed-fruit cultivation.
There is no need to cut down rainforest, didn’t you know that?

And #biofuels should be part of a wider #EnergyMix.

My predictions of 2016 were spot on sadly. 
Programming digital robots is quite fun.
It's pretty easy to log data about my house through sensors and APIs.
Age (turned 60) is not a barrier to learning new and exciting things.
Data is the new Oil.

I don't have to look at my dirty oil everyday in the mirror.
8839 2018-12-18 10:57:55 A few adjustments, probably quarter of a tablespoon of Baking Powder and go with a flavorful Vanilla Protein Powder (two table spoons). Add blueberries, raspberries and coconut yogurt after cooked in a teaspoon of coconut oil. I also like a bit of lemon juice on top also.

8850 2018-12-18 10:55:59 @dylanmatt how about finance & tech billionaires deciding they want public legacy saving the planet from GHG emissions? Strategically making Canadian oil sands production the mark b/c we have ugly open pit mines, which are a relatively small part of the Canadian production base.

8862 2018-12-18 10:53:19 Absolutely! The evidence is purely circumstantial. 
You see, that car could have poured oil on itself and defaced itself, then spilled some on the children just to implicate them. This injustice must not stand!

Pls @segalink , allow me appear as co-counsel to defend them abeg.
8863 2018-12-18 10:53:14 besides, we haven't an oil reserve.
8864 2018-12-18 10:53:13 I am not doubting you, I have 25 years in the energy industry and a book "The Energy World Is Flat" that explains the unstoppable disinflation in oil expected. I also follow Berman. Thx

8867 2018-12-18 10:52:59 As I said in article, just need to be very careful in this space to avoid misleading and factually incorrect information. There are people who want to believe that AGW is a scam so they reverse engineer their world view to make it so. I should know, I come from an oil town.

8873 2018-12-18 10:51:53 In a race, I can smell conditions (brake wear, coolant leaks, oil burn from other cars) & the hydrostatic shock from sound becomes a part of me. The feedback in a shoulder from a corner's tire tells me adhesion & rebound. My feet tell me drivetrain engagement.

8892 2018-12-18 10:49:19 @realDonaldTrump Many federal programs save money over long term. The #ACA did. Vaccination programs.  Improved highways since the 1950s. Rural electrification.

8897 2018-12-18 10:48:34 Was it such good news though? 

We already know pressure is an issue at those upper levels, hence workovers not delivering & planned mechanical intervention.

Also no indication in the RNS that the oil encountered is commercially extractable
8898 2018-12-18 10:48:33 I am confused. @fly_uia told me in facebook that I can take as check in luggage only olive oil I buy at duty free, not in a simple plastic bottle. Which is true?

8911 2018-12-18 10:46:49 It is said that data is the new oil. But I guess that is where the similarity ends. The key difference is that while oil depletes continuously, data keeps increasing with time! Data is also usable and re-usable many times over.

9085 2018-12-18 10:20:59 My children love Korean food, mostly cooked rice rolled with roasted seaweed flakes(김가루), sesame oil, minced carrots and sesame seeds. You can add a little tuna, tofu or some dried baby anchovies(멸치)  in for protein. Jumeokbap(주먹밥)! Kids love it!

9087 2018-12-18 10:20:22 Late 2015 bloodbath was followed by a beautiful 2016. 

Go by that logic and scaling in now the odds are in your favour. Oil bottoming, China/USA all coming to a head and general sense of new year coming.

9120 2018-12-18 10:14:50 Like I said, I have never said more renewable energy ways are without challenges, I have researched that.  What do you think have more impact on our planet Oil & Gas industry or Solar?

9185 2018-12-18 10:04:46 Never mind your witty comments.  Look at the price of crude oil.  It's still crashing down.  Our President promised he would make sure this happened.  And it has.  You do not seem to accept that Trump has super-powers.  Engage with reality.  Promises made - promises made ....

9244 2018-12-18 09:56:32 Is there something special that makes the Newspaper industry more trustworthy than the Oil & Pharma Industries?  The variability of the public's perception is interesting when Science suggests that human nature is more consistent that we often prefer to acknowledge.
9245 2018-12-18 09:55:47 It is fresh olive oil in a simple plastic bottle, not from supermarket. I will put it in a paper box and give it as check in luggage,ok?

9253 2018-12-18 09:54:12 Willingly selling snake oil to a nation when you yourself are cushioned from the impact of your own reckless policies. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Why does maltesers and some of your products not have the sustainable badge on and where does your palm oil come from?

9263 2018-12-18 09:52:00 #OIL looks nasty as things stand - breaking down and likely to consolidate into new lows. 

Any suggestions for a new profile picture going forwards?
9264 2018-12-18 09:51:55 I may have already seen the documentary (or part of it) before watching the film lol. A call went out for more animators on one of the arts industry groups I’m in (I would have applied but I haven’t oil painted in years so I def wouldn’t have been of a high enough standard)
9265 2018-12-18 09:51:54 A united working class against the capitalist class (political and media) will always be stronger than a fractured one divided by a border. Trade unions etc are stronger too.

Do I have the same material interests as an oil billionaire in Aberdeen just because he’s Scottish?
9266 2018-12-18 09:51:35 I was in diapers at the time. Born in 81. Albertans seem to have verrry short memories, especially when it comes to oil. Quite suprised she's only a year older than me.

Yes or no please.

9368 2018-12-18 09:36:41 Ces't la vie I remember when the only place you could get olive oil was the 
chemist
9369 2018-12-18 09:36:39 100bn dollars from 122 countries with a gdp in the tens of trillions of dollar is a rounding error.

The very idea that renewables and cheaper energy and spring boarding developing countries past the coal and oil industry is somehow socialism and not philanthropy is also stupid.
9370 2018-12-18 09:36:33 As now the price that these shale oil companies receive is around USD 40-41...I do not think they can even break even.

9376 2018-12-18 09:35:25 Before Islam was spread by the sword of Umar Ibn Khatab, but as at present  the Ummah use Oil money instead of Sword to continue their mission and application of sharia-law, fortunately it works, all is just because of High level of Massive corruption by the western governments.

9391 2018-12-18 09:34:06 I wanted to buy a hemp oil for 250rs from spencer mall could not because of economic situation bear
9392 2018-12-18 09:33:52 This is literally the most moronic thing I've read.

It is not wealth redistribution, this is the argument used by coal and oil cartels.

What is more absurd is the assumption that my money is default the property of these companies.

9396 2018-12-18 09:33:05 this might be a controversial view but CBD oil does absolutely fuck all.
9397 2018-12-18 09:33:04 Please Please tell me there's no Oil or Gas under the Avery property !!, and this is all a Ruse to Ruin them and take control of the property. B'cos, if this is all the scheme of a woman scorned ( His cousin Sandra Morris ) then I pity any one of us who leaves a toilet seat up 
9398 2018-12-18 09:33:03 OK Derek, sorry to remind you of the flawed case your side produced in 2014.

So let's have you answer please. Did the Indy case in 2014 say iScot could be set up for £200m and be done in 18 months, and did their case include £8b over-estimate of oil revenue? 

Yes or No please.
9399 2018-12-18 09:32:51 I pun confused sbb some beauty experts kata kena ditch cleansing oil , some of them said kena pakai untuk get rid fungal acne
9400 2018-12-18 09:32:50 All I can say is that if you believe US shale will grow 2m bpd in 2019 then oil prices still have more room to fall.
9401 2018-12-18 09:32:31 iNeeda get sum oil..my gearz gettn worn out! #TeaOfTeaz
9402 2018-12-18 09:32:30 I was right here and no, I didn't see any manjan, only news about Exxon starting deep sea drilling for oil and gas exploration. No mention of any "discovery" crossed my eyes. Words like "hopeful" were used. Please share the link to the report.

9406 2018-12-18 09:31:51 Put an oil treatment in my hair. Washed it out. I still look like I have the oil treatment in my hair. Beauty is pettiness my pals.
9407 2018-12-18 09:31:37 No doubt. They are, however, sadly mistaken, as the science clearly shows. It’s not even a vitamin. It’s snake oil.

9409 2018-12-18 09:31:12 diesel runaway??? Cannot always turn off the engine until it finally cooks itself.. If that was on the freeway it could cause large amounts of oil and or coolant to be released over the road..  if a officer was behind the wheel you would hope he had the right licence class

9414 2018-12-18 09:29:58 my fav HL cleansing oil dah tinggal 1cm tinggi dia tapi i taktau nak restock benda sama ke nak (try) perabihkan heimish cleansing balm jvnsdkjvndjk i tak suka sgt heimish tu vjksdnjkdnjk
9415 2018-12-18 09:29:57 You know what can fix the no one can afford issue.... Try raising the minimum wage so people have a living wage.....maybe let's start working on renewable jobs that will lead the way for the future instead of clinging on to the past like coal or manufacturing and oil.
9416 2018-12-18 09:29:33 Inhaling/smoking Isn't the same as ingesting the oil. I've eaten weed, smoked it and used used the oil under my tongue. Great deal of difference. If ya want to know a good value site I'll refer you. :)
9417 2018-12-18 09:29:28 So self conscious about my dry flaky scalp so I bought expensive shampoo and oil SMH. At least it’s best of beauty from allure lol
9418 2018-12-18 09:29:13 well not 100% true though. libya's economy is mainly focused on oil and that has taken a huge hit. If you want to compare Libya with any country the best example is Venezuela. So they would have had challenges don't you think?
9419 2018-12-18 09:29:11 Because it's snake oil. You want a wall, either get Mexico to pay like he promised or pony up your $80. That's what each Trump voter needs to chip in for the $5 billion Trump wants.
9420 2018-12-18 09:29:06 Looks like a good part of those 200k that are long will be forced out eventually. And it is always the same pattern. Oil is smashed lower in minutes.
9421 2018-12-18 09:29:01 You wont but i, someone who cant pay more would have to. Im gonna assume youre mildly wealthy with your bravery in the face of impending cost so the tax isnr for you. Its for the people who commute to low wage jobs. When oil loses that profit theyll jave to charge you even more.
9422 2018-12-18 09:28:50 Except PP isn't an abortion clinic, they may provide the service but the purpose of the company is to provide sexual health treatment and education. Just because Walmart does oil changes doesn't mean they're mechanics
9423 2018-12-18 09:28:42 @BigHitEnt put cuticle oil in one of the prizes for run bts so he can start using it
9424 2018-12-18 09:28:38 Like the Glaziers debt money the Premier  League don’t bat an eye lid. The Oil money coming into your noisy neighbours now and the slave trade working conditions in UAE .. not an eye lid blink.. And they give their outgoing multi millionaire CEO a £5 mill “gift” its immoral
9425 2018-12-18 09:28:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

9427 2018-12-18 09:28:19 I swear. The data they zap like oil money.
9428 2018-12-18 09:28:18 How long are the Scottish people going to lose to about oil my goodness it's the same thing they have said for decades to instil fear.. time to go
9429 2018-12-18 09:28:14 Rosehip oil u better make my acne scars fade away i beg u!!!!!
9430 2018-12-18 09:27:52 In 1948 Japan needed a way to protect its then valuable local hemp industry from drug laws. They decided if a cannabis product has less than 0.3% THC (or 3 mg per ml of oil), then it’s legal. The oil I buy is 2 mg THC & 15 mg CBD per ml. Akie Abe bought the same oil for hubby.
9431 2018-12-18 09:27:40 Yea maybe even lighter oils ain't too bad I found they dnt stain. The bath n body aromatherapy oil is light. But  shit lmao I fucked up a robe my mom gave me n that was my lesson learned

9433 2018-12-18 09:27:18 See your life, who is talking of currently??. Manutd produced a Balon for winner so I don't care when it was. Has PSG ever produced one. Like I said, whether u slaughter us or not, by the end of the season u will still be at O UCL trophies. Not even oil money can save u
9434 2018-12-18 09:27:17 Oh right, obviously I've heard of cannabis oil. Walk round the streets here and you high off the fumes lol x
9435 2018-12-18 09:27:12  cuticle oil that bastard

9437 2018-12-18 09:26:36 If Andrew Scheer was PM he would have flown over and punched the Chinese president out. Then preceded, as only Andrew Scheer could, to pleasure the Chinese president's wife and whatever mistresses. Finally after making China buy only Alberta oil he would have returned to Canada.
9438 2018-12-18 09:26:23 Why are you comparing an asset to a company? That is like saying gold or oil will go bankrupt.
9439 2018-12-18 09:26:20 I can only eat corn chips occasionally because I can down a lot of them without even thinking. Amazing that something as simple as corn, oil, and salt can be that addictively delicious.
9440 2018-12-18 09:26:09 Cannabis oil. It's been legal for a good a good few months now, some strains of it anyway and you don't get the high as the THC is greatly reduced and nearly non existent.
9441 2018-12-18 09:25:48 The tzar Khuylo’s "ingenious strategy" is to shit off all the funds earned on oil and gas and become the enemy of Ukraine and the entire civilized world. Yes, he also revived the dying NATO!

9446 2018-12-18 09:25:18 It seems like a no-brainer to switch to renewable energy so countries aren't reliant on gas and oil imports which in turn enables them to be politically independent too!

9448 2018-12-18 09:25:13 @marksandspencer what steps are being taken to remove palm oil from M&S food products? I am buying mince pies from Iceland this year!
9449 2018-12-18 09:25:01 本当ですか〜？
9450 2018-12-18 09:24:50 I like Beto too, but he’s not Presidential yet, he gotta do a little better on the oil and fossils fuel industry though. Lol Bernie old I like him but he is getting old someone gonna come in his mold but until then let’s not pretend everyone who isn’t Trump is Progressive.
9451 2018-12-18 09:24:47 Yes, I am aware of the disproportionate impact of duty and tax and don't expect the recent 4% fall to make much impact  - but we still have the lowest oil prices for some time.  The other major factor is the weakness of sterling of course. £2 a litre after a No Deal!
9452 2018-12-18 09:24:40 Coconut Oil and lip balm are okay for me
9453 2018-12-18 09:24:24 AND...I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies, financial conflicts, cabinet chaos , fire and fury tweets boggles the mind. Exhausting
9454 2018-12-18 09:24:23 snake oil
9455 2018-12-18 09:24:19 I now use argan oil. Even muzigo is hard paper.
9456 2018-12-18 09:24:18 But it COULD have been an oil tanker. That's my point

9458 2018-12-18 09:24:13 so where are the oil fields? .........
9459 2018-12-18 09:24:08 Until US shale stops growing this oil will continue to fall...Hard to see a bottom for now. No one is going to step in. WTI/Brent fell USD 3 just from yesterday morning. It is so easy to slam this lower.
9460 2018-12-18 09:23:42 I don’t see it as a negative at all. I wish I had been taught those things while I was still in high school. My husband doesn’t think he should teach my teen and young adult stepdaughters how to change a tire, check tire pressure or even how to check the oil. etc...
9461 2018-12-18 09:23:21 There will be NO Market for Oil & Gas in the coming days ahead as Oil & Gas demand in the World will Fall heavily due to Electric Mobility, Nuclear Energy etc. Even ATF demand will fall due to Electric Planes being Built by Int'l Firms.. Only LPG & Lube Oil will hav demand here..
9462 2018-12-18 09:23:19 We are at #Picknpay. We can't buy canned fruit, muesli, jelly, custard, spices, cooking oil, pilchards or margarine. Everything has halaal sign.

The execution of the 1,445km stretch of the underground crude oil pipeline from Hoima in Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania, will be delayed as investors are yet to make final investment decisions over the project, which was to kick off by the end of this year.
9466 2018-12-18 09:22:58 @Digbylj Yes, England won ww2 single handedly after altruistic ally bringing light and peace to those it chose of being decent enough to join its empire. All so liars with vested interests could rewrite history and sell snake oil to the gullible.
9467 2018-12-18 09:22:43 First shots getting fired in Nakatomi Tower just when you're ordering oil on the phone. 
9468 2018-12-18 09:22:31 Most of these people and their social media are financially injected by Arab oil money, so it's under most to support their ideas. Nowadays western countries as been corrupted by Arabian wealth, not knowing that lives of innocent citizens are in danger of sharia-law.

9470 2018-12-18 09:21:44 Oil Down .
Oil rout deepens, down by almost 4% on the day now. 
WTI crude plunges below $48.
9471 2018-12-18 09:21:41 But there may be constraints like high costs and charges in undertaking commercially viable production or non availability of appropriate technology which could be economically applied to extract copious amount of crude oil production
9472 2018-12-18 09:20:48 Is it recommendable to invest in shares of Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL @JayantManglik

9475 2018-12-18 09:20:25 we don't have looters in our midst. PDP is synonymous to corruption they left a lot of liabilities that y d country is in mess as you say. But gradually.... here is  d mess pdp left

9476 2018-12-18 09:20:17 US in SA since 70s, SA bought US weapons then training etc will be US experts not Russian

US & SA allies since long time sure US military support is important but saying protect by US that so funny 8 years Obama suspended support!

if SA suspended oil for month can US survive?
9477 2018-12-18 09:20:15 Yes, sorry. In English it's castor oil, in Polish we call it ricin oil, my mistake.
Basically, I heard that story, that the same oil that we used in the past as laxative, was used as a machine oil for those planes' engines.
9478 2018-12-18 09:20:07 Information is the new oil - #AI is the new mining mechanism...
9479 2018-12-18 09:19:55 Crude Oil making new lows. Trading at $44.42

9484 2018-12-18 09:18:51 No idea why people are getting mad about your use of cannabis oil. A victimless crime, even if you were using it for non-medical purposes. Just goes to show, even people living here in the West can be as primitive as cultures & governments of primitive countries.Hope you get out.
9485 2018-12-18 09:18:43 Because we won't be talking about poverty, infrastructural decay, debt liabilities today without talking about 16 years of mismanagement. Imagine having 112 million in poverty in 2012 when oil sold for 100 dollars
9486 2018-12-18 09:18:42 Aku cuma dipakein baby oil kok.
Oppa howareyyyyuuuu
9487 2018-12-18 09:18:33 surely that'll be a fault then and so covered £FOC. Unless of course you've foolishly put fuel in the oil filler.

Thought not.

9490 2018-12-18 09:18:27 what's going on with oil? a dollar down in 5 min.

9493 2018-12-18 09:17:55 Trump will not help an uprising in Iran just as Bush Sr didnt help the Iraqis standing up against Saddam Hussein. Washington is only interested in regime change if they can steal the oil and loot the country empty as they did with Yeltsin in Russia and Iraq.

9504 2018-12-18 09:16:09 And I may be wrong, but wasn’t it Paul Martin who signed that deal for Saudi oil, and it is transported here on his ships? #Conflictofinterest?
9505 2018-12-18 09:15:49 I don't see you presenting any hard evidence why climate change is "hogwash", so I am not really that inclined to base my post with more arguments than yours. Telling someone to shut up is a telltale sign of knowing you're wrong though.
Of course I can survive without oil and gas

9516 2018-12-18 09:13:57 Such theories, suggestions, ideas, postulates or schemes are well in the knowledge of ONGC/OIL etc
9517 2018-12-18 09:13:53 The fall in oil prices by nearly 40 % from its recent peak & still falling ( though probably not a lot more from now on) is a tail wind for Modi Govt & it should not miss the opportunity to reduce fuel prices very soon @narendramodi

9524 2018-12-18 09:12:51 Crude oil Price Going down in the international Market. Just Broke 50 USD Support. Good times ahead for oil importing economies like Pakistan if Oil manage to settle around 40 USD / Barrel.

9536 2018-12-18 09:11:08 Goes even deeper, to the Saudi’s. Coincidentally, we import tons of Saudi oil, in ships that are allowed into the St Lawrence unopposed, but banned on the west coast.
9537 2018-12-18 09:10:58 That’s why less is more. Add 1 drop of oil je. Bkn i suruh tabur minyak hahahhaha
9538 2018-12-18 09:10:51 Cannabis oil. They’ve known since 1974 its anti-cancer properties. Why has there still not been ‘enough research’?
Don’t want to be denting the profits of the multi-billion dollar cancer industry now do we? 
9539 2018-12-18 09:10:43 Incredible plunge in oil overnight. This is in the heart of capex planning season for shale.

9544 2018-12-18 09:09:53 By the way, is it true that the planes in the WW1 era used the ricin oil in their engines? I've read or heard it somewhere, they'd be spitting the oil into the pilot's faces, making them rather desperate for the loo after touching down.

9552 2018-12-18 09:08:50 Thanks  I made an infused oil with rose and calendula flowers, and added peppermint, lime and lavender oils.
9553 2018-12-18 09:08:50 I don’t think Americans have an impartial news source. It’s sad. And all the while the message to the world is corrosive. Russia will invade the Ukraine and Saudi will continue to starve the Yemen’s over OIL and real estate and religion; unchecked!
9554 2018-12-18 09:08:44 Olive oil, not holy oil
9555 2018-12-18 09:08:37 "Oil debt" is enough. It s government and govt. is a continuous process. Its not personal where you claim theirs and ours.

9575 2018-12-18 09:05:46 It is harsh. 15 years in prison for possession of a herbal oil? One day you will realise how primitive that is. Westerners need to stop going to these third world countries and supporting them and their incompetent laws. #Bali #Indonesia
9576 2018-12-18 09:05:37 What's the problem with using extra virgin olive oil?
9577 2018-12-18 09:05:16 There will be NO Market for Oil & Gas in the coming days ahead as Oil & Gas demand in the World will Fall heavily due to Electric Mobility, Nuclear Energy etc. Even ATF demand will fall due to Electric Planes being Built by Int'l Firms.. Only LPG & Lube Oil will hav demand here..

9587 2018-12-18 09:02:52 As usual misrepresenting the issue by a country mile to defend 'maligned white guys.' 
This of course doesn't explain other lucrative less life threatening non oil rig professions.

9588 2018-12-18 09:02:34 Someone is making money from this game of snake oil sales. Shame it is neither you nor I but I think we don't sleep with one eye open because of it. Hope you enjoy a fabulous festive period.

9631 2018-12-18 08:55:23 That's incompetence or ignorance... It has nothing to do with Political affiliation, it's about our attitudes as Zimbos... We expect govt to procure cooking oil, medicines, fuel, mealie meal etc... What's then is the role of private enterprise? We need new thinking

9633 2018-12-18 08:54:07 It's mainly cause they still very much dependent on Oil, their financial sector is trash. This is the only reason why they're having parties now.

9650 2018-12-18 08:51:41 Yes, I posted that. The video said that oil is a resource that regenerates itself over several years in the Earth's core.

9918 2018-12-18 08:05:40 Our clients as minors were framed. Given their heights and trajectory of the oil spill, it is a obvious that a taller third party (probably the cameraman) staged this with malicious intentions towards our clients. We will sue and claim for psychological and economical damages

9933 2018-12-18 08:03:41 "#USD lost some ground as dovish tone is expected from #Fed over economic outlook for next year.

9938 2018-12-18 08:02:56 The oil companies have their issues. NNPC never diversify its business portfolio towards upstream activities instead rely on JV a business model that has failed to provide many Nigerians opportunity to specialized. Those appointed failed to grasp the need to change business model

9951 2018-12-18 08:00:50 The problem is SOMEBODY always has to pay .Do you service your car ? Has it broke down ? The answer’s probably no to the 2nd question. Yet the government treats the nation like a car that it’s failed to service .Now the oil light’s on ,tires are bald .This country needs a service
9952 2018-12-18 08:00:48 Are you trying to say that Jesus died the same year he was born.
It seem you oil well of sense is dried up pls pray for sense
9953 2018-12-18 08:00:45 The oil price crash is the what exposed our economy. 
Unavailability of dollars in an import based economy led to scarcity while banks made a fortune selling the forex in their custody to the highest bidder. 
The reserves were low so no way we could subsidise the economy.

9960 2018-12-18 07:59:35 Please let’s get our fact right before comparing the past and present administration. The price of crude oil was very high during the last administration compare to the price that will have now. Our budget is being prepared with crude oil price.....
9961 2018-12-18 07:59:27 You are just throwing insults around without making any sense! What are the oil marketers paid for? What is the government paying them for? Let us start the debate from there.

9976 2018-12-18 07:53:55 Recommend to all that they might want to look up essential oil healing. Get a diffuser and you can avoid the risk of flu entering your house altogether. Plus help you get rid of the flu if you have it already. An ancient form of healing.

Who has extra the person with 100 or the person with 40. GEJ failed to improve on education housing healthcare wages was N18000/mth.

9982 2018-12-18 07:52:41 For once, my procrastination worked in my favor. My CBD discount was increased to 60%. I ordered pet tinctures, isolates,balms, and coconut oil for less than what I paid for just isolate! Unfortunately, the one balm I wanted to buy and isolate flavor were out of stock.
9983 2018-12-18 07:52:20 Please can you tell me the price of crude oil before this administration?

9991 2018-12-18 07:51:11 No one is bashing imran khan on the technical aspect. They are bashing him for first selling the manjan of “we have found the greatest oil and gas reservoir of the century, which will change course of pakistan” ,without really knowing the technical aspect of it.
9992 2018-12-18 07:51:08 I took a critical look at those children and asked 'how can the oil stain get to the top of the with little kids without showing what they climbed on? '

9994 2018-12-18 07:50:55 When you're determined to include "Iranian" in your news title and body as if no other type of "crude oil" could cause this! 

This is what you expect when you are dealing with anti-Iranian propaganda.
9995 2018-12-18 07:50:42 My family made analogue cheese - colour, H2O, milk powder, oil. Even if they'd managed to engineer stilton - unachievable as it happens - they'd have run foul of existing regs and specs. They've now dropped analogue for mozzarella and given up on the *game changing* histrionics.

10007 2018-12-18 07:48:25 No Steven told the narrative of how he was "mucking around" and that it "lit up". No mention of why it lit up (Steven doused the cat in petrol and oil) and no mention that it was his premeditated idea.
