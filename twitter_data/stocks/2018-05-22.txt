81 2018-05-22 23:07:16 Yea, I realize now that it would have been more clear to ask how many *different* stocks have been in the top ten since 1990.
82 2018-05-22 23:05:47 What I’m trying to explain, white people got a good foundation, through their parents to assist them, a simple thing warren buffet said he was given knowledge at young age about investing and that guided his philosophy, at 10 he already bought stocks - that’s the advantage.
83 2018-05-22 23:05:39 Overcrowded longs in the russell... that's all I've been seeing lately "russell breaking out.. huge for stocks".
84 2018-05-22 23:05:34 I think it’s important to establish what interpretation of SoV is used.

Some see it as wealth preservation with little/no volatility. (E.g gold is a strong store of value)

Others see it as wealth appreciation (e.g Stocks are a strong store of value because the long term growth)
85 2018-05-22 23:04:19 I agree with banning bump stocks and increasing the background and vetting process. It's a start, but not a solution. The solution will take all of us on many different levels.

103 2018-05-22 22:55:20 5. That helps the economy. A strong middle class helps the economy much more then a strong 1%. Investments do not help the economy. No goods or services are being exchanged when you invest in stocks.

112 2018-05-22 22:49:03 Banning bump stocks & curtailing sales of what I would refer to as effectively machine guns would be a start at 'doing something' as would dialling down the glorification of weaponry & NRA rhetoric. For starters. None of this has happened.

139 2018-05-22 22:37:38 تدوير في هذه المستويات ؟
ما اعتقد خصوصاً ان لا توجد هناك مؤشرات على التدوير الا في اسهم قليلة جداً وجلسات قليلة جداً ايضاً
140 2018-05-22 22:37:01 الى ٢٦٠٠ مبدئيا ...
141 2018-05-22 22:36:42 Should be a scaffold not stocks
142 2018-05-22 22:36:13 على المساحة الاكبر من الشارت .. التجميع ممكن يكون صمن نطاق اكبر من ٢٠٠ نقطة.. 
هاد بافتراض انه تجميع اخوي بو عالية مش تصريف او تدوير .. 
لسه الابواب مفتوحة .. 
عالاقل اسفل مستويات ٣١٩٠ برأيي

145 2018-05-22 22:33:37 Universal background checks, close gun-show loophole, increase purchase age to 21 and ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
146 2018-05-22 22:33:21 عن نفسي
ما زلت عند اعتقادي السابق
الهبوط مع استمرار السيولة وتحسنها تدريجياً حتى خلال فترة الجمود من مؤشرات التجميع والعلم عند الله
147 2018-05-22 22:32:55 Somebody is bummed out he didn’t put stocks into Netflix sooner, it’s doing great, and higher than ever.
148 2018-05-22 22:32:42 yes of course it is .. which is why the species is struggling to begin with plus the deforestation #VancouverIsland affects #Salmon stocks ... BUT I don't think doubling tanker traffic is gonna benefit the cause.. It's not an all or nothing situation.. it needs to be addressed
149 2018-05-22 22:32:29 “Under New Jersey’s new bump-stock ban, which was approved in January, residents were supposed to destroy or turn in their bump stocks by mid-April.

So far, New Jersey State Police say, they have not received a single one.”

174 2018-05-22 22:23:29 Market III: Mild negative reversal by #nasdaq, volume falls by a touch. So, no distribution day. But breadth continues to improve. Nasdaq advance-decline has poked into new high ground -- i.e. more #stocks rising than falling. @netflix just 2% off its high, steady above 10-wk MA
175 2018-05-22 22:22:47 These biotech stocks experienced strong positive money flow in Q1 as the prices already reflected: $PTCT $ECYT $IOVA $NVTR $GTHX $QURE. But a few of those stocks have not risen yet. Find them before they rise.
176 2018-05-22 22:21:33 Now take these small towns gutted by losing their biggest economic force then have to deal with the growing power of big box stores such as walmart that stocks their stores with the very garbage they used to make but from a third world country.
177 2018-05-22 22:21:27 Not only is leadership addressed in today polls, but GUN LAWS are as well. Vote your side on bump stocks ( the attachment that makes a semi-autonatic weapon) being sold in GA.

طبعا حتى الان لا السوق عموما كمؤشر ولا حتى اعمار لم يرتقي لاختراقات توحي بانتهاء الاتجاه الهابط 

ولكن نتابع ونعتقد ان القاع قريب وليس كما يروج المتشائمين

اخوي بو عاليا في محللين كاتبين على تشارت اعمار 1.30 هذا شيء خيالي

180 2018-05-22 22:20:18 Many Amazon employees have profit sharing in Amazon stock options. They can always purchase more stocks if they want to also increase their own wealth.  Quit making it sound like he makes that money in cash everyday...IT’S ALL BASED ON HIS STOCK OPTIONS!!
181 2018-05-22 22:19:28 HUYA salió a bolsa hace unos días y ha doblado , BILI salió a finales de marzo y ha subido poco, un 10%, si saca resultados buenos mañana podría explotar . IQ salió tb fin de marzo y ha subido un 15-20% , a las dos ultimas les veo recorrido.
182 2018-05-22 22:18:58 What do you mean banks are struggling their stocks have never been higher
183 2018-05-22 22:18:18 Don't play the penny stocks.
184 2018-05-22 22:18:06 whats your year end target on s&p and NOONE talking about market because main street lost all their money ..people dont come in to play 5 stocks where multitude of stocks crashed and sufffering
185 2018-05-22 22:17:54 It's benefiting the corporations far more than the people.  Rather than hiring or increasing salaries companies are buying back massive amounts of stocks which reward shareholders not employees.
186 2018-05-22 22:16:44 Trade stocks raising 
187 2018-05-22 22:15:26 At least the next few years are gonna be a good time to buy new stocks and bonds
188 2018-05-22 22:15:22 Does level 2 reading work much better for small cap stocks, or can you use it with the same results on say a tsla?
189 2018-05-22 22:12:58 3. You don't need bump stocks or large ammo magazines to do that, either. And if you think you're going to defend the Back 40 from the feds with an AR-15, you'll be mightily disappointed when the Sherman tanks roll in, which I personally think is more mythological than realistic.
190 2018-05-22 22:12:34 Stocks er up!
191 2018-05-22 22:12:20 Don't most people use Wall St. as shorthand for stocks and Sand Hill Road as shorthand for venture capital?

197 2018-05-22 22:06:46 @MarcFaber always has referred to extreme valuations but nowadays everything in the bubble seems possible. But finally I think, the yield/debt load will indefinitely decide each stocks fate.
198 2018-05-22 22:05:49 Yep they've finally dismantled their old, useful finance page where you could really track stocks. Now its just kind of useless - their finance page.
199 2018-05-22 22:04:05 consumer debt already higher now than any time in 2008, already inflated stocks are going to artificially go up again due to another barrage of buybacks, but all of that is short term, we were looking at another recession anyways, Trump and the GOP just sped it up.
200 2018-05-22 22:03:42 Obama was bought and paid for by Soros. Soros put them on Netflix. Soros bought Netflik stocks.
201 2018-05-22 22:02:53 My thoughts exactly kate s. Thought about taking profit and dumping mine, then thought about it and how games getting played with the speccy stocks even the ones that are derisked. Not selling !

212 2018-05-22 21:51:14 $LIT is Lithium fund, but its heavy in Tesla... and cobalt, which is needed for lithium ion production. Apparently China is buying up the lithium market. Something to look into if you're interested.

Also, cannabis stocks are ripening. $Kshb(I own) and $weed.
213 2018-05-22 21:50:10 I don't invest in stock market personally. My retirement $ is conservatively invested

214 2018-05-22 21:50:00 Tuesday's range in EuroStoxx Futures was 24 points, or 0.7%, compared to the average range for 2018 so far of 1.3%. EuroStoxx has posted a daily range of less than 1.0% for 12 days in a row. The run last extended to 13 days on 18 October 2017, 149 trading days ago #stocks
215 2018-05-22 21:49:41 U.S. stock indexes closed weaker today on mild profit taking. World stock markets were mixed overnight, with Asian stocks down & European stock indexes modestly up. Little risk aversion in the marketplace recently is driving many world stock indexes to multi-month highs $SPY $QQQ
216 2018-05-22 21:49:23 For example, if the market crashes and all your money is in a gold precious metal ETF like $GLD, you're safe and probably profited from the crash, as gold is a good hedge vs the dollar(non commodity stocks ie anything not metal, oil, etc). $SLV is silver fund.

219 2018-05-22 21:46:55 The spikes and dips in this graphic are huge.  Go from 180000 to 350000 following the moratorium 94-96. Major swings in past few years but is this the trend or bad data. Swings look too drastic to be an accurate reflection of the stocks

226 2018-05-22 21:43:16 Stages is how it works. Literally no one outside the military needs a weapon that fires hundreds of rounds per minute. Stop further sales of those. Stop further sales of bump stocks. Stop the media, politicians & the NRA glorifying firearms & pretending they're a good thing.
227 2018-05-22 21:42:38 Two pedestrians jaywalked across a street today. And a pedestrian crossing just down from them. All pedestrians are evil, and should be put in stocks.
228 2018-05-22 21:41:44 And yet #Cobalt stocks are languishing for want of capital investment. Carmakers want their minerals but are unwilling to put down money for their extraction. So instead they'll pay extra money for the tight supply. Shortsighted business strategy.

251 2018-05-22 21:28:57 The compelling part about Qmom for me was @alphaarchitect’s point that stocks can be mispriced bc of pessimism (value premium) or mispriced due to insufficient optimism (momentum premium). It’s congruent with the behavioral explanation of value investing, if not the classic texts

Example, from 1990 to 2000, there was no volatility observed among tech stocks whose prices consistenly went upward.  Tanga ka lang.

Nor do they give market analysis why companies give higher dividends and buy back stocks. (Investors/stock buy back when its undervalued to avoid takeovers).
351 2018-05-22 20:41:24 O vende menos por un tiempo, que es lo único que puede hacer si su costo aumenta. Que el precio baje es una posiblidad en tanto el margen lo permita. Bajo el costo solo en tanto haya stocks y vendedores desesperados por hacerse de dinero, mucho no puede durar.
352 2018-05-22 20:40:56 Yeah. I did some calculations and the Gold gains were incredibly frontloaded after the 2000-2003 recession.

383 2018-05-22 20:26:08 The good news is there's more traders than ever in penny stocks and the volatility is great...you gotta be a fucken moron not to study up & recognize it & profit on at least some of the volatility, just takes practice and it really clicks 1, 2 and especially 3 years into the game
384 2018-05-22 20:25:17 Right, what you say is true for shareholders who vote at annual meetings, or contact corporate relations, or can contact board members.  Mutual funds focus upon putting certain stocks in their portfolios.  The is little incentive, nor need to get involved in day-to-day at Twitter

401 2018-05-22 20:15:22 Does today’s $DJI close change your bullish sentiment for stocks?
402 2018-05-22 20:15:16 Buybacks kicking in now...after stocks were hammered during earnings season.
403 2018-05-22 20:14:37 Hensarling is buying the bank stocks while Waters is talking them up.

For their joint account.

(Congressmen really invest like that! And it's legal!)
404 2018-05-22 20:14:30 Wall Street’s take is that stocks have been around for literally centuries, and they’re not going to change *that* much in a generation.

405 2018-05-22 20:13:06 The devices DO NOT convert a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic one. This is the first and most important point to understand.
Bump stocks were legalized by Barack Obama’s ATF in 2010.  Bump-stocks were legalized because they are “an accessory, not a conversion device.”

407 2018-05-22 20:10:23 I guess you just don't own the right stocks...
408 2018-05-22 20:09:52 Gotta have rules. Rules to get in. Rules to get out. If you don't have rules: you'll eventually not need rules. Why? No $$$ left. #stocks #investing
409 2018-05-22 20:08:56 Thats one reason why i dont use stop loss. Too dangerous today and in the big flashcrash 2011 even stocks like procter&gamble lost over -50% for a few minutes because of the ETFs.
410 2018-05-22 20:08:28 get it while stocks last xoxo
411 2018-05-22 20:08:26 World stocks mixed: US -.3%; Europe +.3%. Trump headline news on Korea causes partial reversal of yesterday’s gains. To repeat myself: Foolish to buy or sell based on anything he says, focus on economy & earnings. 2018 still likely up year.
412 2018-05-22 20:08:21 Perhaps not. But index funds have definitely impacted in the way individual stocks perform compared to the index. The best (or worst) stocks stand out less than before.
413 2018-05-22 20:08:12 Stocks... we've still got them
414 2018-05-22 20:08:07 Today's results...
$APRN 6.17%
$GE .26%
$MU 6.4%
$NOG.57%
Very interesting day. 
Made money on MU and APRN . Optioned them both.

Nasdaq -0.2%, S&P -0.3%

Small stocks halt winning streak, Russell 2000 - 0.6%
420 2018-05-22 20:06:24 Yeah, stocks closed lower today which makes zero fucking sense, just like the world we live in

425 2018-05-22 20:05:18 $SPY Many I'm sure quick to state that the markets are going down. Perhaps question based on what time frame / which trend / which stocks?
426 2018-05-22 20:05:04 $SPX is chop city, working to make everyone miserable as those few traders still at their desks push this thing this way and that. But end of day, stocks going to new ATHs this summer. $SPX 3000. Reflation wave coming.
427 2018-05-22 20:04:58 I definitely hope this doesn’t become like 2010-2012 in the stock market when everyone was bullish on Chinese stocks, only to find out they were all pretending to work when foreigners would visit. (see The China Hustle on Netflix)
428 2018-05-22 20:04:53 We are all united in wanting to help, wanting more. I also noticed that a group as large as 15k cannabis investors is asking for a Q&A...... The silence is golden rule does not work with stocks.

465 2018-05-22 19:46:18 Because the @NRA actively lobbies against sensible gun registration, restricting bump stocks, background checks, mental illness requirements and enforcing safe gun storage, all of which would have helped prevent the last few school shooting.
Because @nra has blood on its hands.

487 2018-05-22 19:35:50 CT literally NOTHING is being done to reduce the number of firearms in the US at present. Banning bump stocks would be a start. Then ending the sale of weapons capable of firing hundreds of rounds a minute (no member of the public needs those. Why would they?)

497 2018-05-22 19:30:40 Bump stocks. SMDH. They're gay, but they don't make a gun more lethal. They do the opposite. Anyway, the gun grabbers can have that concession only if full autos are legalized.
498 2018-05-22 19:30:17 If peer reviewed science indicates net pens are damaging wild stocks, changes are needed. However, eliminate farmed salmon from the global commercial market and they will be replaced by wild fish. Be careful what you wish for.

Call me crazy but I added 10k more shares. This can see a 30-50% move just like the others stocks that have been doing.
504 2018-05-22 19:27:09 Incidentally the US also did the same for Auto industry it literally purchased stocks in these company and literally directed their policies during the period. That is the definition of nationalization.
505 2018-05-22 19:26:41 If US stocks fall just 5-10% on a sustained basis, US retail sales, housing sales, auto sales & consumer durable goods sales will likely begin slowing notably within a few months; take US stocks down by more & the effect will likely be faster & more pronounced.

534 2018-05-22 19:06:24 Just under an hour until the close of Tuesday trading and U.S. stocks are taking another leg down to session lows- $DJIA last seen down more than 100 points. USD still up on the day, but the yen is seeing some haven demand, with USD/JPY -0.08%.

536 2018-05-22 19:05:54 Was at a large seminar where FCA was challenged vehemently as to why they'd let companies offer solutions which they deem to be unsuitable. 

It's still all very subjective (and with the benefit of hindsight makes it harder!)

542 2018-05-22 19:03:28 #Stocks,#Indexes CAUTION: an SPX top signal by Type A, but not Type R, models has completed. Only once going back several years has this occurred, and the subsequent selloff was minimal, and ended sans bottom signal. We post "SPX top signal" only when it is by both models.

551 2018-05-22 18:57:43 Also Medicare was the most sweeping healthcare reform in history. The ACA is some trash dreamed up by the Heritage Foundation to enrich insurance companies and healthcare providers. That's why it has no price controls. That's why insurance stocks went up when it passed.

668 2018-05-22 17:48:45 You need to enter reality. Look at what the equity market did during that period. Stocks don't go up during recessions. The SP500 went up 250% during Obama's 2 terms.

709 2018-05-22 17:27:20 Hi Peace. I'm unable to give "Financial Advice" instead watch the feed for tips and suggestions. Stocks can go up and down and you may not get back what you put in. As always only play with what you can afford to lose. 
710 2018-05-22 17:26:17 My paycheck is 20 bucks more a month while corporations and rich people save billions. But hey, at least they can buy back 700 million in stocks, right?
711 2018-05-22 17:26:05 A lot of companies did use it as trickle down wealth. A good example would be Nationwide. However Harley Davidson isn't doing well as a company. Over priced and poorly made bikes. Buying back stocks was smart, being American made was their only selling point.

718 2018-05-22 17:23:46 Making an investment is a way to increase the amount of money an investor has by placing the money in a financial security. This can be investment in anything that potentially grows in value like stocks, bonds and bank accounts.
719 2018-05-22 17:21:40 Being a STH doesn’t mean you know more than Gase. Who is known as one of the best QB evaluators in the NFL. What does it say about your opinion that you oppose his?

730 2018-05-22 17:17:45 Counter-trade means to take the opposite position.

A term originally applied to stocks, but often transferred to other things which are superior;

- You still pay the corporate income tax on stocks held within a pension. There is no tax on imputed rent, so property tax can be justified as a proxy.
- There are limits on contributions (RRSP/TFSA/DC RPP) or benefits (DB RPP) to tax-preferred pensions.

859 2018-05-22 16:03:51 1/3 Interesting study. Needing 200-300 names to maximize my Sharpe ratio isn’t something I hear often from value investors. Most studies that try to discover adequate stock diversification seem to lead to around 30 stocks getting rid of nearly all stock specific risk (~95%). And
860 2018-05-22 16:03:38 The general point is that SPY is one of the most popular, no-brainer investments for safe, SOLID returns with lower "risk" compared to straight-up stocks. There are a ton of ETFs like this, and yet the young crowd is throwing money away into Tesla, which won't exist in 2 years.

915 2018-05-22 15:38:21 The 2nd Amendment will never be abolished but it was written in a time when there were no assault weapons and bump stocks. It could certainly be updated.  There is no reason any ordinary law abiding citizen should own an assault rifle.
916 2018-05-22 15:37:36 Um... I see facts don't matter to you. Obama created more jobs in each of his last four years than Trump did in his first!

920 2018-05-22 15:34:16 But I think the most reliable/consistent way to get Babe Ruth returns from a few stocks is to buy a spread of contrarian stocks and accept that a majority of the picks won’t work out; IMO it’s harder to be contrarian with a concentrated approach, and results aren’t as reliable

1036 2018-05-22 14:38:43 $NCRA very similar to $BTHI.  Both post RS stocks both did 200 share round ups.  Both have low OSs.  But NCRA actually got whacked 5k to.18s.... Thats crazy bc most holders only had 200 shares except for prob bigger holders from pre split.  prob a bid sit bc could get whacked imo

1040 2018-05-22 14:35:15 I agree that the NRA does allot if good or I would not be a life member, but they have been negotiating with politicians with respect to 3 day waiting periods and bump stocks. A slippery slope.

1045 2018-05-22 14:34:41 The defense stocks are getting shelled
1046 2018-05-22 14:34:30 Well, no. It's not "factually correct" to say that stocks are nonfinancial assets or that net saving "requires" a deficit. Its actually, factually wrong.

1048 2018-05-22 14:34:06 Good suggestion but keep in mind 65 YO madman who massacred 58 & wounded 500 in Las Vegas with assault rifles upgraded to automatic with bump stocks-1100 shots in 10 minutes.  No one thing will stop violence-well thought out plan of comprehensive actions can minimize.

1080 2018-05-22 14:20:29 Banning bump stocks and raising the age of purchase for assault rifles from 18 to 21 are good ideas, and may lead to a decrease in overall gun violence, he said.”

1085 2018-05-22 14:19:20 Chris, this has nothing to do with what I "like". Stocks are financial assets. You learn this in accounting 101. If MMT wants to call them bananas then fine, but stocks aren't bananas. 

If you refuse to understand basic facts then why engage me here?

There should be a question on the ballot asking if bump stocks should be sold in GA. Please pay attention to the wording.

A "bump stock" is a device that allows firearms to mimic automatic gunfire.

1173 2018-05-22 13:39:42 In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay
Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,
The heart luxuriates with indifferent things,
Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,

1174 2018-05-22 13:39:10 Stocks are financial assets. The market value of stocks are net additions to net worth. You can't just ignore things like this because they dont fit your narrow (read, wrong) definition of "financial assets".
1175 2018-05-22 13:38:39 Seems like pennies are in play. Look for stocks under .50 or even 1.00 for potential big moves. 
1176 2018-05-22 13:38:20 You have not had bump stocks for generations.
1177 2018-05-22 13:37:42 So many headwinds on every front but stocks push higher. I don't get it.

1185 2018-05-22 13:34:40 There has not been any dramatic economic change from what Trump inherited from Obama - except the decline in stocks starting in Jan when Trump proposed his erratic and incoherent tariffs. Now that he’s pulled those back the Obama economy can return. Trump learn his lesson?

1252 2018-05-22 13:04:42 Thanks for sharing, Jeff. We would add that stocks, at least here in the U.S., are likely to come under threat as the 10-year gets closer to 4%. As of now, the relative value of stocks still looks attractive, especially after the recent re-pricing.

1259 2018-05-22 12:59:17 Local investors too. Stocks for example, many are very EPF dependent. This is likely to change. Doesn’t help that now we know that some previous stats are probably wrong and the clusterfsck that the previous govt left with debt (this can affect bonds too)

1310 2018-05-22 12:34:57 Wow do some research first! FBI has been involved with this gang since early 2000s..be honest, what did Obama do to help all the murders you speak of??? NOTHING. That’s right, he lifted the ban on bump stocks during his administration. It’s pathetic how much you hate this man.

1314 2018-05-22 12:33:36 Turn it around and think of the reaction he would get in Germany if he said something along the lines of "Low interest rates have forced me to invest in stocks and I'm happy to say I've been successful doing that so far." Unthinkable in the current political climate in Germany.
1315 2018-05-22 12:33:04 I think the biggest problem with this whole GOML thing is that people somehow think that taunting away stocks/sets is actual, high grade disrespect when it’s like, baby’s first beef.  Don’t give bayo mains the idea they’re doing anything important outside of making top 8 boring.
1316 2018-05-22 12:32:08 Because cheds also used to trade penny stocks. In OTC land, you see and trade a lot of scams and shit stocks. They're easy to spot and fun to watch people fall in love and defend it all the way to the bottom. Basically...XVG is a shitcoin and hes been warning people

1318 2018-05-22 12:30:59 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U. S. national debts & public stocks owned by Chinese government, enterprises and oligarchs, (2) kick ALL the Chinese banks out of the SWIFT system, (3) change the regime in Beijing.

1329 2018-05-22 12:21:03 What promises has trump kept? Also isn’t that the problem, he has no promises on guns Bc he’s beholden to the NRA, he said he was getting rid of bump stocks immediately after parkland through DOJ, been 3 months, nothing. This isn’t 1 of his BS propaganda political “promises” kept
1330 2018-05-22 12:20:44 Judging from stocks at my local large @sainsburys store (removed ready meals) @Tesco definitely have the edge.
1331 2018-05-22 12:20:05 He destroys and humiliates us in public, his punishment should be in public. I suggest putting him naked in stocks on a flat bed truck and driven around the country so each and every citizen can spit on and throw shit at him. after a year or two of that execution.

1334 2018-05-22 12:14:42 Futures were higher this morning after a Monday rally that saw the Dow post its best daily gain since May 4. Stocks were already on track for their best monthly gains since January, and these advances are only solidifying that position.
1335 2018-05-22 12:13:50 @jitenkparmar any reason why sugar stocks are gaining ? did govt lift the limit on exports? or they just bottomed out ?

1346 2018-05-22 12:05:09 TRUMP talked about raising age for purchases of assault-style AR-15s from 18 to 21, banning bump stocks of AR-15s, & tightening up background checks on gun buyers. WHAT DID HE DO? Lie and tell gun owners that there is A manhunt out for them. #VoteThemOut We #MarchForOurLives
1347 2018-05-22 12:05:00 China and the US issued a joint statement over the weekend, vowing not to launch a trade war against each other. Trump muted. Stocks jump.

1389 2018-05-22 11:38:19 Hey Mike, another reason for my CALL Option buy (s) is the short position against UEC is 8%?  This is 2X to 3X higher than other sector stocks (DNN, URG, UUUU, & CCJ).  I can just see a squeeze if they sell the TiO2 asset in a rising market.  I meet up with Scott and Amir today.
1390 2018-05-22 11:38:11 There are often many reasons that lead to these massacres. The common denominator is the GUNS. Regulate them as we do cars, including liability insurance on every weapon. Ban high clip mags, bump stocks & certain types of guns. Close loopholes.

1396 2018-05-22 11:29:21 He did not ban bump stocks.  He supported the ban on bump stocks and it is not being brought to the floor of the Senate because GOP won’t put it to a vote, even though they know it will pass and Trump will sign it.

1405 2018-05-22 11:21:53 “A lot of the left” is not trying ban guns.  The left is promoting the ban of bump stocks & gun legislation to reduce access to individuals that are mentally unstable.  85% of ALL Americans agree with their agenda, but the GOP won’t bring a vote to the floor on bump stocks.

1418 2018-05-22 11:04:36 Just like how @NRA agreed to a ban of bump stocks after Las Vegas shooting. I had real problems with them before that, but that ended any hope of my seeing them as a good faith actor.

1436 2018-05-22 10:55:39 I find it strange that in America you can incinerate your capital by:

 Healing your body
 Spending too much
 Educating your kids
 Gambling in casinos
 Speculating on stocks

Yet people are not allowed to invest in early stage companies.

Crowdfunding changes that.

1439 2018-05-22 10:53:18 It's only artificial if the value of the company is simultaneously decreasing. If you have 10 stocks and the company is worth $100 , your stock is worth $10.  If the company buys one back, your stock is now $11.11 and the company is still worth $100.  It's not artificial.

Reduction in tax rate from China on imported cars is great news for JLR cars. Effectively means 10% lower price tag without hitting margins and higher affordability.

1588 2018-05-22 08:37:36 5. Invest Using Dollar-Cost Averaging
Dollar-cost averaging is the practice of regularly transferring a certain amount of money into an investment account to buy stocks/funds. This approach forces you to buy more shares at lower prices and fewer shares when prices are higher.

1590 2018-05-22 08:35:50 Agree absolutely. There are some writers who get so furious that their 'genius' has not been recognised. You sort of have to do the work so that the opportunities will come and then you have to be ready when they do.

1594 2018-05-22 08:32:38 10. Invest in Stocks for Free
Ordinarily, investment tips for beginners don’t include individual stock investing. But if you’re investing with little money and want to take a stab at researching and buying individual stocks, use free investing apps to cut your trading costs.
1595 2018-05-22 08:31:25 11. Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio Annually
When you invest, choose an asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and risk capacity. If you’re younger, you might hold higher-risk and higher-return stocks and fewer bonds.
1596 2018-05-22 08:31:19 Such a shame. It happens so often in auditions too!

1598 2018-05-22 08:30:57 12. Don’t Time the Stock Market. Don’t try to play the professional game of watching technical charts and trying to time the stock market. Play the amateur game. Don’t try to squeeze out every percentage of return from stocks by trading and analyzing.

1807 2018-05-22 05:21:46 Morning all! 

- Asian stocks traded mostly subdued amid holiday closures and a lack of fresh catalysts. DXY was sideways around 93.50 following its recent pullback from YTD highs
1808 2018-05-22 05:20:15 PHARMA SECTOR topped on April 2015 & from the last Quarter of 2015 to till now, It is in receiving end. My Opinion is, this year bottom will be formed and in coming future, many more years. may not see this year bottom edge (whatever it may be) in several stocks in this sector.

1888 2018-05-22 04:25:28 Reminder- @realDonaldTrump already petitioned the ban.  It's now up to ATF to change the definition of bumpstock to fall within the definition of "machinegun" so that it can be banned.  If AFT fails then its up to Congress to change the statute to include bump stocks.
1889 2018-05-22 04:25:13 Why not? We gave corps the big t ax cut so they could buy back a record $178B in stocks.  Why not let the big banks go back to the free wheeling days of sub prime loans and derivatives.  What could go wrong?

1901 2018-05-22 04:12:12 i think about a lot of things but the banning of bump stocks and AR-15’s is what i think about the most

1904 2018-05-22 04:09:39 WITH a bump stock, you can SIMULATE a full auto fire mode. That is correct. I for one don’t like bump stocks and agree that THEY (the bump stocks) should be banned. BUT the AR-15 is not classified as an assault rifle. Branding doesn’t count, as it’s not official classification.

1910 2018-05-22 04:04:42 I love taunts.

It's how you know you're a true friend.
1911 2018-05-22 04:04:19 Sort of correct. But I personally don’t like bump stocks. If the ban goes through and stays, that’s fine by me. But the stock doesn’t change the class of guns. Many people who own AR-15s don’t have bump stocks. Therefore, they still have a semi auto rifle

1922 2018-05-22 03:56:17 Thanks for the tip. Did a quick dive on marijuana stocks.
1923 2018-05-22 03:55:25 Pls advise some good stocks
1924 2018-05-22 03:55:14 Never sleep on anyone. The wrastor i played on stream at g5 said that he didnt play the game and i didnt believe him. Treated him like any other threat and realized a few stocks in that he was telling the truth lmao
1925 2018-05-22 03:54:26 With all due respect, stocks are for thieves and brutes.  School shooters deserve to be hung or crucified on the outskirts of town and left for the birds and animals.  Just saying ...
1926 2018-05-22 03:54:16 lol why would I invest in stocks when I could build out my downline
1927 2018-05-22 03:53:11 totally agree
the main reason that individual stocks are traded is to generate fees for financial institutions
That said, (and this isn't a justification, simply a fact) if this didn't happen then it would be much harder for smart folk like Steve Cohen to generate returns for us

1933 2018-05-22 03:50:57 Sure and thanks for the episode. Marijuana stocks are gaining some momentum and its good to hear from experts about their take on the same. Been a long time listener and have always enjoyed ur brilliant podcast!

1935 2018-05-22 03:50:21 Put these school shooters in stocks in a town square and let people douse them with eggs and rotten vegetables, berate them, humiliate them as they deserve and then see how many will follow. Harsh, yes, but it would work.
1936 2018-05-22 03:49:35 I'd rather own $JPY here over long Japanese Stocks. I still think U.S. Stocks will outperform but the #Yen is a great hedge against "stock market uncertainty" around geopolitical risk / trade / dollar. I feel "safer" being contrarian long, same way I would buy Gold or Treasuries.
1937 2018-05-22 03:48:05 Not sure why I would have anything but a clean conscience.  I do my own work.  I cheat nobody nor spread false information. Sometimes my stocks go up, sometimes not.  

I have no clue what your investment strategy is but it appears we differ since only one of us studied MU.

1947 2018-05-22 03:37:29 I'm not "anti-gun"...which they all start screaming as soon as you say anything sensible. But, I want new regs on assault rifles. I want to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. I don't believe in a right to an arsenal of military grade equipment. That's all nonsense.

1949 2018-05-22 03:35:23 BTC ticker sits there entire show.

1950 2018-05-22 03:35:13 I recall research reports from both GS and JPM published in Dec 2017 that found valuation (PE) explains less than 10% of a stocks price move on a timeframe of <= 12 months. Think I’ll stick with those guys
1951 2018-05-22 03:35:12 Hi David. IMHO best #uranium #stocks to own are those having world-class high-grade #U3O8 assets with strong M&A takeout premium potential, highly-leveraged to rising #U3O8 prices Fission $FCU & Denison $DML have highest takeout potential, from my due diligence. Own both.

2046 2018-05-22 02:34:28 The problem is that film, by its very nature, doesn’t stay pristine forever. Even film stored properly shrinks and fades over time (especially the older film stocks). But even striking prints via wet gate manipulates the image.

2065 2018-05-22 02:24:31 I checked the news, and this was just something that was proposed. Imagine if it was approved. At the same time, it may crash if it wasn't, so you would have to drop right away. I like the potential here. Reminds me of pot stocks.
2066 2018-05-22 02:23:55 @MarionONeill1 , you told me that raising the age limit to buy an AR-15 from 18 to 21 was very hard for you, personally. Please, do something about gun control, or bump stocks at the very least. People are dying at the ripe old age of fifteen in school shootings.

2109 2018-05-22 01:53:21 Bump stocks, banned in Canada before they could be imported. Gun control or more accurately put control over who is allowed to own them and what they are allowed to own is not evil, it is just common sense.

2118 2018-05-22 01:50:49 We have found that these #stocks tend to go through several cycles in a year around earnings time.  They bid up before earnings, sell-off after earnings guidance isn't astronomical, level off, start upward trajectory again...rinse/repeat every 3 to 4 months.
2119 2018-05-22 01:49:07 David - do not quit on this issue.  Absolutely no question bump stocks should be banned. They serve no useful purpose .

2123 2018-05-22 01:46:28 Bump stocks are just media  driven fake drama. They do not make an AR full auto. That's  why Obama's ATF  approved their sale.

All bump stocks do is allow the user to have his finger repositioned to allow the trigger to reset faster.

2132 2018-05-22 01:36:43 It was easy. I just entered a few sentences about why bump stocks are bad. 

Don’t just tweet your agreement, follow the link to the Gifford petition to the ATF.
2133 2018-05-22 01:36:28 Are you gonna sell me some stocks now?
2134 2018-05-22 01:36:13 I hate when they pull that “all clear for stocks?” shite. If they’re going to pretend to be market experts, they should at least know that there is no such thing as “all clear.”
As Peter Lynch said years ago: “there’s always something to worry about.”
2135 2018-05-22 01:34:55 Prime News: Wall Street Gains as US-China Trade War Fears Ease: Stocks ended higher on Monday as trade tensions between the U.S. and China eased for the moment, while investor sentiment was also lifted by news of dealmaking activity. The Dow Jones industrial average soared…

2139 2018-05-22 01:34:05 Yes. Need those stocks to keep going up
2140 2018-05-22 01:33:08 Do your job and ban bump stocks

2143 2018-05-22 01:30:59 The idea that this mkt is just waiting to be 2018 all over again is embodied by that #CNBC #FastMoney screen headline "All Clear For Stocks."

2144 2018-05-22 01:29:06 Why not? Many past SOTs have provided an opinion on stocks and bonds.
2145 2018-05-22 01:27:52 @Blaw722 Going long on penny stocks works too obviously but going short allows you to be more patient and when red.  Just an idea.  These penny stocks on go up so far and usually have a rug pull eventually.
2146 2018-05-22 01:25:55 He ISN'T doing his job! He's whining about Hillary because the Mueller investigation is closing in on him. He promised to ban bump-stocks a couple months ago, but seems to have dropped the ball on that simple promise. OUR NATION DEMANDS ACTION!
2147 2018-05-22 01:25:40 @Blaw722 Do you go more long or short?  If long maybe try to learn more short biased because it allows you to hold out longer on these penny stocks.  I know Mike's strategy is nail and bail but if you're struggling and blowing up then you need to regroup and maybe change a little
2148 2018-05-22 01:25:24 Finding a grower that will take your capital. Or creating that person in your circle. It’s not something of ease like stocks sadly. Just an idea for the future that’s far easier for me to do and hopefully others in due time
2149 2018-05-22 01:25:19 @AT09_Trader what broker do you use to short these hard to borrow stocks
2150 2018-05-22 01:25:16 It was great.

2152 2018-05-22 01:22:43 There will still be significant risk in that portfolio. You can diversify to a much higher degree in stocks. One could make the argument that a few heavy bags in this space of the leaders and a few choice small caps is the optimal play.
2153 2018-05-22 01:22:15 Addressed it, again, with simple platitudes that will never amount to action on his part. Where is his ban on bump-stocks, just to start with? He promised to at least act on that and hasn't.

2155 2018-05-22 01:21:25 Bump stocks are still legal and sold. In case you don't understand how they work, they make semi-auto high powered rifles shoot just like automatic weapons. Like the guy in Las Vegas used leaving 58 people dead and 851 injured in 15 minutes.
2156 2018-05-22 01:21:10 Theylle be laughing stocks..and he might be in prison for murder
2157 2018-05-22 01:18:25 The funny thing is yall probably dont even know what bump stocks do.
2158 2018-05-22 01:18:19 cool / interesting / brave to see your percentages - interesting - makes me think of my stocks - I have things a bit more spread out (smaller percentages of holdings), but also have a large position that perhaps balances things out
2159 2018-05-22 01:17:00 Bishen, lives on Neptune Ave with their beloved skink.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
2160 2018-05-22 01:16:41 Index is managed very nicely with select few stocks. In reality stock prices have come down significantly especially mid and small caps. Year 2018 is the year to remain cautious and we maintain that markets will remain volatile on either side for next 12 months.
2161 2018-05-22 01:15:41 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
2162 2018-05-22 01:14:39 Well it certainly isn’t behaving as if it will be bigger one day.  Almost all my stocks have outperformed since last year.
2163 2018-05-22 01:14:30 Alors déjà TOUTES les règles qu’on utilise sont arbitraires et décidées par la commu. 1v1, timer, 6 minutes, stocks, terrains légaux, items off, rien de tout ça n’est réglé par défaut.
Une autre règle qui a été décidée est « pas de customs », aka on passe pas par l’écran customs
2164 2018-05-22 01:14:25 IRON ORE US$67/t -1.4%. Vale to begin keeping stocks of iron ore in China due to long haul and improved access to Chinese market.
2165 2018-05-22 01:13:26 People have a problem with it because many believe the Obamas are criminal, just like many believe trump is criminal. No one has control over Netflix but their investors. If the stocks take a hit from loosing massive amounts of subscribers then investors will be pissed.
2166 2018-05-22 01:13:06 @DisneylandToday will there be re stocks of the Alien Popcorn Bucket between now and the 24th? I haven’t been able to purchase one sadly.
2167 2018-05-22 01:13:00 European stocks rose on Monday after an easing in US-China tensions on a quiet day, with multiple markets including Germany and Switzerland closed
2168 2018-05-22 01:12:01 US stocks rose on Monday as investors applauded easing trade animosities between the US and China.
2169 2018-05-22 01:11:33 Food Fact of the Day: Stocks are amoung the most basic preparations found in any professional kitchen. In fact, they are referred to in French as fonds de cuisine, the “foundations of cooking” #Food #foodbloggers #YUM

2173 2018-05-22 01:09:42 58 people were killed in Las Vegas last year and the GOP did a collective shrug (after a half-*ssed, wussy "attempt" at banning bump stocks). There is never going to be a tall enough pile of bodies to loosen the NRA's chokehold on the GOP.
2174 2018-05-22 01:09:02 Remember how WWE's stocks went up a lot today and for some reason they allowed this to go out?
2175 2018-05-22 01:08:55 Both #nvgov candidates support tighter gun control measures. @SteveSisolak  said he'd support banning bump stocks, assault weapons and background checks for firearm owners. "Donald Trump supports the NRA. @AdamLaxalt refuses background checks. We need to change that," he said.

2180 2018-05-22 01:03:43 IMO the next few months will present great opportunities for investors. The Canadian stocks are my top picks.
2181 2018-05-22 01:03:00 Texan here too, with a family full of gun owners who support common sense reforms like closing gun show loopholes that avoid bkgd checks, insurance w/ CCLs or open carry, and banning bump stocks. I worry about people who DON’T support everyone getting a bkgd check.
2182 2018-05-22 01:02:56 Prime News: European Markets Mostly Higher as Trade War Concerns Ease; Italian Stocks Drop: French and U.K. stocks ended higher on Monday with investors monitoring weekend developments in U.S.-China trade talks. The upbeat trading mood in stocks came after Beijing and…
2183 2018-05-22 01:02:49 You don’t need a magazine of 10 bullets to protect your family! Unless you are a real a-hole with a lot of enemies! If that’s the case, buy your own security force. But semi-automatic rifles w/large mags & bump stocks should be outlawed. They serve no purpose but violence.

2188 2018-05-22 01:00:47 Marijuana stocks r heading higher . IMO only those who do nothing will regret not investing in marijuana. The sector is hot hot .
2189 2018-05-22 00:58:34 they banned bump stocks, and started making kids use clear backpacks. other than that no. i care more about taxpayers dollars being used for abortions
2190 2018-05-22 00:57:56 It’s a waste of time. 1000s of other stocks that don’t have nearly the drama
2191 2018-05-22 00:57:49 So basically if you start your 401K young and invest in stocks in 30 yrs you will ve a millionaire
2192 2018-05-22 00:55:57 And I clear over 100 more per week, pay less taxes,  ..my company is finally adding production,  buying new equipment. Stocks are good.  Yes, he's one bad dude!
2193 2018-05-22 00:55:17 Your support of the tax reform package escalated the debt. This is a thinly veiled message that you intend to slash spending on the programs the poor need in your district. I know you’re proud of giving tax cuts to corps who only buy back stocks, but you should be helping people.
2194 2018-05-22 00:54:30 1) universal background checks. Over 90% of Americans want this.

2) A ban on bump stocks. What happened to trumps promise?

3) holding people accountable for letting their guns fall into the hands of murders

2196 2018-05-22 00:52:06 The Dow industrials climbed back above 25,000 and the S&P 500 finished at a roughly nine-week high as investors applauded easing trade animosities between the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks booked a fourth record close in a row.
2197 2018-05-22 00:52:00 I understand you want to purchase the Oneplus 6 64Gb variant. Due to overwhelming response and limited stocks, the phone was sold out. Kindly stay tuned to our website for more updates regarding the product. ^GD
2198 2018-05-22 00:51:35 I hope this means you get to buy stocks with shares in other stocks

2209 2018-05-22 00:40:11 Why doesn't @MelissaLeeCNBC challenge her guests? 
Biggest concern w/ rising rates is what it does to stocks, not real economy. Aka how it has ALREADY hit dividend plays, even though underlying profits are unaffected. Stocks shall be down 50% if GDP is -2%. No link silly.
2210 2018-05-22 00:40:09 Will NRA ever advocate for universal background checks, Red Flag laws, safe storage laws, banning bump stocks, age limits, CDC studies, etc? If not and you vehemently oppose these ideas, than any criticism of NRA is deserved. Yes, there are other factors, but above can only help.
2211 2018-05-22 00:39:23 Open up NRA , (all stocks and barrels) loaded with the ammunition you give , we  give back to you!
2212 2018-05-22 00:39:18 Daming nawalan ng pwesto and stocks 
2213 2018-05-22 00:39:09 Almost 600 people got shot in Las Vegas in ten minutes, and bump stocks are still legal.  Still not enough...
2214 2018-05-22 00:39:06 hte fame is getting to me... I'm relying on my Weetabix stocks to buy me Pariston lovers
2215 2018-05-22 00:37:56 I’m interested in learning bout stocks and bonds one day. We gone have to have that talk
2216 2018-05-22 00:37:47 I figured a combo of homemade smoked duck and pork stocks would have all the depth I would need. (And people were fucking questioning my flavors—WTF...)
2217 2018-05-22 00:36:21 Unfortunately many of those who have left the NRA recently did so because they feel the NRA is not radical enough (for example, the NRA favoring an administrative ban on bump stocks).
2218 2018-05-22 00:35:41 Ban the bump stocks now
2219 2018-05-22 00:34:44 Todd Stocks issued a walk in the inning but strikes out Chandler Freed to end the inning. Stocks is at 68 pitches through five with the Lions still searching for their first hit.
2220 2018-05-22 00:34:33 Yes these stocks have been beat up quite a bit lately! Wish WMT went down a little more before going up but I’ll take it.
2221 2018-05-22 00:34:12 One of the amendments guarantees no cruel or unusual punishment. Wjen that was written people were being put in stocks, and being tarred and feathered.  That wasn't considered cruel or unusual so we need to get back to constitutional basics
2222 2018-05-22 00:34:00 Ban bump stocks. I voted for it in Georgia early voting.
2223 2018-05-22 00:33:51 it’s just a word of caution..some unknown analyst in UBS downgraded it after last qtrs. earnings which were great & good guidance!  all other analysts were bullish & it still dropped like $18! MM & HF can move stocks,short 2 shares @ a time push down
2224 2018-05-22 00:31:43 Basing a refund on speculation is ridiculous. Can you buy stocks based on speculation pricing and then get a refund if it doesn't turn out that way? Why give a refund when nothing has been cancelled?
2225 2018-05-22 00:31:10 Don't forget that your state can also ban bump stocks so vote in your local elections, too!
2226 2018-05-22 00:30:18 I should've invested in mirror stocks.
2227 2018-05-22 00:28:33 Because it's a school safety issue not a gun problem.  Ban assault weapons and bump stocks.  Ok, and #SantaFe massacre still happens.  Until we prioritize school safety and fund it focusing on the @nra is a waste of time.  Oh, and repealing the #2A with @POTUS in office? SMH
2228 2018-05-22 00:28:06 Ban bump stocks.  Sensible and reliable gun control now.  Save our children and citizens.  And vote in November.
2229 2018-05-22 00:27:56 The very wealthy hide large sums money away where it can't be taxed, and shuffle pretend money around as 'stocks'.  The rest of us save what we can, and put the rest of it back into the economy.  So, which ones are the "takers"?

2232 2018-05-22 00:25:16 Sooo excited that SB restrooms and tables will now be open to vagrants, homeless, and mentally ill. A great campaign that will surely enhance the paying customer experience.  Stocks are bound to go up as well.  #MountKisco

2235 2018-05-22 00:22:31 It’s not hurting my feelings. I’m I. Construction. Things are booming. My stocks are doing great. Illegal immigration is down. Americans getting back to work. America has a much better outlook on its future with trump, that’s why it took off the first few days in office.
2236 2018-05-22 00:19:35 Up 60% on our opening trade on Ehave, Inc. $EHVVF at $0.04, The stock looks strong and MedLeaf (LEAF) owns 10% of the company. With the action in cannabis stocks, I'm holding on to see where this goes. Be careful entering stop loss orders.
2237 2018-05-22 00:19:04 $UPL BOOOM ! 2.30 after market if ur into $energy stocks and don't know bout this gem, give it some DD undervalued isn't the word!
2238 2018-05-22 00:18:47 Stocks surged Monday after trade tensions between Washington and Beijing cooled, and even as the Trump administration clashed with Iran on its nuclear program and sanctions relief. The dollar hit a fresh five-month high, and the 10-year Treasury yield held comfortably above 3%.
2239 2018-05-22 00:18:33 I haven't forgotten about Stocks 2. It'll be ready.
2240 2018-05-22 00:17:41 Vince doesn’t care. Stocks are up.
2241 2018-05-22 00:17:16 Much fewer than you think. Ed Wolff of NYU estimates that the top 10% of households hold 84% of direct and indirect holdings of stocks, including pension funds. The bottom 90% only hold 16%.
2242 2018-05-22 00:16:32 @jimcramer Love your stuff!  We were responding to a a post another user posted about $NVDA @ you.  We prefer to use call spreads collars here to play getting long $NVDA. #Options offering pretty good leverage/convexity #investors #stocks $LRCX $AMAT

2246 2018-05-22 00:15:09 Todd Stocks is through four innings with only a walk allowed to Broadfording. Grace leads 5-0 going to the bottom of the 4th.
2247 2018-05-22 00:14:20 But the economy (stock market) is doing great!  

Every american get stocks at birth, right?
2248 2018-05-22 00:13:47 Speaking of ads - when is the @DNC going to produce tough ads that show Trump's promises and question "did he improve?" healthcare, bump stocks, NK, Iran, infrastructure, transparency - and ask the public what they got out of the sweet foreign bribes from Saudis, Emiratis, etc.
2249 2018-05-22 00:10:04 They don’t drive the price up the purchasing of the stocks does
2250 2018-05-22 00:10:03 Yes , but rather it be gallows after a good long soak in the stocks.
2251 2018-05-22 00:08:32 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks now! Enough is enough!
2252 2018-05-22 00:07:01 Obama is Soros puppet. Soros set this up and has purchase their stocks.
2253 2018-05-22 00:06:40 This whole thing is fucking nuts. trump and his slithery comrades should be dragged out by their short hairs and put in stocks on the WH lawn. And that useless EC should be eliminated & ground to dust. Popular vote only.

2255 2018-05-22 00:05:13 That is hardly any action. Bump stocks can still be 3D printed, people can still bump fire or use a string or rubber band. Stupid posturing.

2257 2018-05-22 00:02:56 I'm all for banning bump stocks. The gun violence restraining order. More money toward mental health intervention for troubled kids. Elimination of ridiculous policies that stopped criminal offenders from being reported.
2258 2018-05-22 00:02:54 Ban bump stocks. So, we don't have to be #TerrifiedofAmerica
