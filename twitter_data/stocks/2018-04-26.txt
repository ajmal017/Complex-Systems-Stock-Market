16 2018-04-26 23:51:38 Agree. If short desperately tries to cover and long hold tight and keep buying WITH company updates, short will be squeezed. BUT, a lot of longs have gained quite big at this level. Who knows, will see.

19 2018-04-26 23:49:57 Yes. We were hit hard with the recession. We lost all our stocks, almost lost our house. My husband was unemployed for 9 months. He is a chemical engineer. With the development of alternative energy research, he was able to find employment again, we rebuilt our stock

44 2018-04-26 23:45:53 IMO, the stuck shorts will have to cover and if the longs who are stuck don't dump into the bid, the squeeze will be epic.
45 2018-04-26 23:45:45 Both cases were interesting. People clearly had motives to sabotage both players' draft stocks
46 2018-04-26 23:45:13 This is free money from both ends. Not only do you get $10 from me but you also get the free stocks and all’s you have to do is sign up
47 2018-04-26 23:43:51 i wish i was good at trading penny stocks
48 2018-04-26 23:42:42 What will happen when the transfer shares hit the market?
49 2018-04-26 23:42:21  you don’t wanna know
50 2018-04-26 23:42:01 So, since the orange dingbat has been “prez”, my stocks are down, interest rates are up, gas costs more, healthcare costs more, and the US has lost its leadership position in the global community, and $1.5T in new debt. We won’t even talk abt the criminal indictments. What else?
51 2018-04-26 23:41:22 Hahaha I wish I had this much success with stocks
52 2018-04-26 23:41:11 Josh Rosen looks like he needs to be shorting stocks on Wall Street.
53 2018-04-26 23:40:15 Individual mandate repeal will cause healthcare cost to increase for anyone that plans to keep buying healthcare. Abortion is still legal. The rest of this list is so sad also let me guess you cant name one of those 800 Obama regulation repeals.
54 2018-04-26 23:36:10 I know. Somehow in their diseased minds, a Canadian based company is sold (stocks only) to a Russian company and somehow it's Hillary's fault.

What's next? A Mongolian sells his goat to a Chinese farmer and Hillary's responsible for that too!
55 2018-04-26 23:35:57 Well, I hope you held on to your stocks. I told you not to panic & sell.I told you we are starting a second leg up on markets. Did you see Amazon, Domino’s pizza, Chipolte all up over 
100 $ just today ! Unbelievable , I don’t think it’s going to stop any time soon. Keep D’FAITH
56 2018-04-26 23:35:43 yes!! i didnt know how to add that but in general, people here are not very much aware not in tune with the LINE brand very much. other than bt21, what about the original line friends? if there are no stocks for the bt21, will people still go and buy some of their stuff? how many
57 2018-04-26 23:35:33 David is tap dancing around in his prom suit asking me if I want to buy stocks
58 2018-04-26 23:32:41 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners!
59 2018-04-26 23:32:14 Wise move. Let's be glad we finally have a smart business man in there. My 401k is boomin. My stocks are boomin. It's cute to bring up the past tho. It's about as silly going back 500 years saying whitey stole the land. War is hell. Move on
60 2018-04-26 23:31:36 But they didn't win did they?! That's my point..your contender (biggest mistake) lost. If Trump had lost yall would have ripped him apart for even running. Instead yall try to rip him apart for taking on Hillary and WINNING. Say what you want but I reserve the right to call BS.
61 2018-04-26 23:31:19 Bump-stocks in the wrong hands have been shown to have devastating consequences and it’s gratifying to see the Illinois Senate pass a bump-stock ban. I urge the Illinois House to do the same.
62 2018-04-26 23:29:40 US government influence of the stocks .. they can't have facebook die can they ? ..  much data on people to collect ;)
63 2018-04-26 23:28:51 I remember the same things being said about Javy.
Back to resource stocks.
64 2018-04-26 23:27:45 Nature can heal itself, but there have been a lot of people that have helped to clean up the Pawtuxet in WW! There's lots of wildlife around.

65 2018-04-26 23:27:33 Stocks at a stupid high
66 2018-04-26 23:26:23 Stocksのxsh回収し忘れた
67 2018-04-26 23:23:43 ... Or overvalued stocks...
68 2018-04-26 23:22:45 I been saying this  Honestly someone should say something to whoever stocks the stores/marts
69 2018-04-26 23:22:43 You know Goldman sach still owns more than a million Tesla stocks, don’t you?
70 2018-04-26 23:22:10 Bullish flag formations are found in stocks with strong uptrends. $TSLA not in a strong uptrend.
71 2018-04-26 23:21:35 People can say i spam stocks on headers, literally such a pointless insult i make them for fun and i try to have fun with it, you can see my real designs in my cover arts
72 2018-04-26 23:20:52 (Obamacare, incidentally, also worked much better in areas where GOP-controlled state governments didn’t interfere with implementation)
73 2018-04-26 23:20:12 This stock already figured that acceleration out...the question is what’s next. Second derivative is not as attractive as it appears ex Whole Foods. Growth stocks are second derivative stocks.

76 2018-04-26 23:19:16 ...but maybe there will be a move to ban chicken stocks?
77 2018-04-26 23:18:33 Democrats ran on the “we will improve healthcare” platform. Even if you don’t like the solution they came up with, that’s a pretty far cry from Donald Trump running on the “ban Muslims and deport Mexican rapists” platform.
78 2018-04-26 23:18:32 Nintendo obtaining 5% of Cygames' stocks is huge. I'm actually interested in that Dragalia Lost mobile game

80 2018-04-26 23:15:54 Is the  stocks bull market over?   or $GOLD about to start ?
81 2018-04-26 23:15:45 My friend died because he couldn't afford to see a doctor for years & when he finally did the doc told him he had stage 4 cancer & there was nothing he could do.If he would have went to the doctor years ago they could have saved him.Yes, I am saying you dont care about ppl dying
82 2018-04-26 23:15:15 Dès que je trouve un produit AB qui est bon et qui ne me donne pas mal au ventre, soit il y a des ruptures de stocks soit le prix augmente de plus de 60 centimes :(
83 2018-04-26 23:12:20 This is how the debate is simply fuhhhcked. You actually believe I don't care about people's deaths. That's insane and discussion can't really proceed. Note that I was mostly asking questions and pointing out that it's deeper than people like Bernie suggest.
84 2018-04-26 23:12:03 Of course there is ! We both know that #Facts but In a world where most popular females are highlighted because of body parts , you can come through smiling and waving  W/O the extra ! Your stocks are worth more 
85 2018-04-26 23:11:08 I'll say it again everyone is mad because they where not invited to the pump. Who cares go buy stocks and maybe get your 10% return. Gat thanks for you free good advice.
86 2018-04-26 23:10:36 No, I don't invest in any company I write about, zero money in tech or related stocks directly or indirectly.
87 2018-04-26 23:10:15 Who has $140k to invest in stocks? Can I get a mortgage or loan to invest in stocks? I can to get a house. Home ownership is not an investment like people say, but this comparison is not great.
88 2018-04-26 23:09:42 Where's the list of 60 stocks
89 2018-04-26 23:09:36 Yes... Don't mind which... And in some stocks in Hastings with some rotten tomatoes to throw at her... That's if she actually knows where Hastings is...

91 2018-04-26 23:08:13 I am an American and I don't share your rugged individualism view not all Americans are the same. Also you don't seem to have a problem with 40k Americans dying from lack of Health insurance every year so no you don't support my humanitarian concerns.
92 2018-04-26 23:07:54 Notice that we could also lower highway speed limits to half of what they are and undoubtedly save thousands of lives / year (40,000 auto deaths per year in U.S.). They don't, though. Is that because they don't care or are evil ? Or is there a deeper more complex answer ?
93 2018-04-26 23:06:45 So what, you know NBC set this bullon  so he wouldn’t have controlling stocks
94 2018-04-26 23:06:27 All good with the idea of no bump stocks but Jesus H Christ, Rahm when are you gonna admit you are an absolute failure at reducing murders in Chicago? Telling law abiding people they are not allowed to defend themselves is not going to solve anything
95 2018-04-26 23:06:23 That doesn't mean there aren't very good LT stocks hidden in there that have been labelled like all the rest in a downturn in the market or sector

Finding them isn't actually all that hard. Holding them is the hard part.
96 2018-04-26 23:05:10 おやすみママ
97 2018-04-26 23:04:04 Unconstitutional laws yes since they don’t make bump stocks anymore banning them would be useless.
98 2018-04-26 23:03:41 Well with spec stocks we all know that generally its the market and not the stock that dictates where the stock ultimately ends up . So if you're trading off a chart or momentum or whatever then you need the right market to do it in.
99 2018-04-26 23:03:21 Just don't buy any more Tesla stocks please
100 2018-04-26 23:02:08 People always get excited and want to buy stocks when they are an all time high not realizing that buying at all time highs is probably the worst time to buy. Stocks always come down at some point. No need to “rush” in the middle of a rally (in my humble opinion).
101 2018-04-26 23:00:50 The Container Store stocks acid-free cardboard archival boxes of various sizes, including folios that ought to fit a half-folded newspaper. They're not exactly cheap, but I think generally less than like Hollinger Metal Edge. It depends on how important they documents are to you.
102 2018-04-26 22:59:42 Copper stocks are building some nice bases.  Long way to go though. $CMMC.TO tiny little player has the best chart IMO.
103 2018-04-26 22:59:33 I can’t get simple to look good lol I always add stocks an shii because it looks bad without for me
104 2018-04-26 22:58:55 Hide the kids and run for the hills! I sure hope the Libs get Trump out before unemployment goes to zero and stocks hit 30k
105 2018-04-26 22:58:13 Throw in the towel if we break to new highs? What is the possibility that US Gov't throws open the printing presses? No way out off $ trillion liabilities.Are we not Venezuela or worse? Stocks and bitcoin look much better than confetti from Washington?Are we missing something?
106 2018-04-26 22:57:43 Even stocks love the guilty #BillCosby 
107 2018-04-26 22:56:58 Mummy H reminded me of the Time that Daddy H signed A Cheque thing at Stocks and the bank declined as it was not his usual signature due to having over imbibed Daddy had to come back next day
108 2018-04-26 22:56:40 I'm not sure the 'I have a need therefore other people have to pay for it' philosophy is compatible with the rugged individualist American ideal. I appreciate your humanitarian concern--I share it. But it just butts up against fundamental philosophical differences.
109 2018-04-26 22:56:37 These stocks are not trading on fundamentals. This is an eyeballs-picker’s market.
110 2018-04-26 22:56:03 Please dear forefathers!  Make us proud.  Give the perverted pos a visit he won’t soon forget.  Bonus points for locking him in the tower.  If you still have the stocks or guillotine . . .
111 2018-04-26 22:55:42 
He can go in the stocks and have wet sponges (or other things) thrown at him. Just think of the money you'd raise for charity! 

112 2018-04-26 22:55:32 ACA being dismantled - Indiv. & BC mandate repealed
1st woman nominated to run CIA, major tax reform, 
largest pay raise for military in 7 years, defines life begins @ conception, cuts 800 Obama regulations, fires Jim Comey, the list goes on.
Main difference.. No HRC presidency.
113 2018-04-26 22:54:46 Announcement----Rope stocks after hours soar on Comey interview
114 2018-04-26 22:54:46 Imagine they are stocks and you are the one who decide how  much% dividends
115 2018-04-26 22:52:59 I want to get into real estate, stocks, ect. So my ppl i fw straight and my daughter. Keep money flowing for generations. I also want to help the homeless in my city with a clean and helpful shelter. I want to create a kids center also not no mediocre shit either
116 2018-04-26 22:52:44 40,000 Americans die every year do to not having health insurance I'm sure they would prefer waiting over death
117 2018-04-26 22:52:37 I think personally I never liked sparkling water bc it doesn't normally taste great but la Croix actually tastes decent  my mom stocks the shit out of it instead of drinking coke and juices so I'm happy it's helping ppl avoid bad shit
118 2018-04-26 22:52:25 $QQQ up 1.3% after hours, but of that gain, nearly all is accounted for by these 3 stocks:
$AMZN +7.1% (9.87% of index)
$MSFT +3.5% (9.86% of index)
$INTC +5.5% (3.31% of index)

This means that rest of index will basically be flat if $QQQ opens at this price tomorrow.
119 2018-04-26 22:52:16 So proud of you, Majority Leader, as you prevented survivors of the LV slaughter from testifying; intervened to allow the continued sale of bump stocks; punished Memphis for removing Confederate statues; and twice refused to denounce white nationalists and neo-Nazis. Take a bow!
120 2018-04-26 22:51:41 Did Khai tell you that his stocks went down?

122 2018-04-26 22:49:58 Please reply! Trying to gauge how many people here are using @sharesight for tracking/monitoring their medium-long investments in #asx #smallcap stocks.
123 2018-04-26 22:46:15 Add some dividend stocks and CDs as well.  You want growth spread out and even when you sleep, lol.
124 2018-04-26 22:45:35 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
125 2018-04-26 22:45:19 Everyone is so happy today bc their stocks went up ONE day.

133 2018-04-26 22:35:57 Dems hurt certain demographics as well. Blue collar workers, those of us with insurance having it jacked up sky high so others can skate on by, religious, business owners....so..suck it up buttercup.

208 2018-04-26 21:43:01 As for the idea that because there is interest that we must forever be trapped in some hellish bond villain's cycle of more debt to pay for it, that usually originates from a basic misunderstanding of stocks and flows. If youre interested I can run through it for you?

231 2018-04-26 21:30:15 Actually the fact that your stocks are owned in street name is a huge problem. This allows big banks and trading firms to take brokers margin on your certificates. In effect gambling or earning interest on your assets.

238 2018-04-26 21:24:05 no question that growth has outpaced both true value stocks, and phony value indexes.  However, all of those value indexes don't meet the definition of value, as defined by the inventors of the strategy.  can't have a price/book over 2 and PE over 15 and be a value stock.

259 2018-04-26 21:06:22 It took four days and major, major earnings beats. But now, the market seems to actually be focusing and reacting to Earnings rather than everything else floating around (rates, tariffs, input costs, trump tweets, etc)

262 2018-04-26 21:05:21 A rubber band, a finger, a stick and other things you can not ban can also duplicate bump stocks functionality on ANY semiautomatic firearm. The  proposed #BumpStockBan would set a precedent to ban all semiautomatic firearms thus every #GunOwner must oppose any bump stock ban #2A

282 2018-04-26 21:01:14 It already is. I think this might encourage a bit more aggression or at the very least, better pacing to what is already a campy game simply because the value of stocks is way more so as viewers every stock is a more significant change in outcome probability.

292 2018-04-26 20:56:47 #Russia's MoD briefing on #Syria & strikes: if, in their opinion, objects that were bombed had stocks of poisonous materials, striking it w/cruise missiles could lead to large centres of contamination of the terrain. In would inevitably kill 10s of 1000s of people in Damascus
293 2018-04-26 20:56:26 Disagree, I think it gives even balance to patient and aggressive play. With aggressive play you can steal a set with a big quick lead. In 4 or 5 stocks an early lead means nothing because you can camp your way back to last stock.

306 2018-04-26 20:50:17 I’m not advocating going all puritan and throwing people in stocks for fornicating of course - not at all. I just think we need to look seriously at whether mostly-monogamy was a VERY effective civilizational hack that prevented many ills.

308 2018-04-26 20:49:39 World stocks generally higher: US +1%; Europe +.9%. Investors turned their focus to earnings &  were rewarded with continuous beats. The only thing investors can count on is high volatility. Good environment for option traders but not for most anyone else.

312 2018-04-26 20:48:34 Imo the increase in variance is somewhat negligible considering our formats. With Bo5 WTF then 3 stocks variance is only slightly more than 4 stocks and over the course of a year your body of work won't take a hit (zero sum game). But the rise and fall in between benefits fans.

525 2018-04-26 18:50:25 past 2 days all the indexes and many stocks made back more than 50% of the lows from 20 days ago. Hope ramps hard while reality is slow to sell down. S&P needs to decide on your fib pattern moves higher the last 2 sessions. Sellers absent for now.

536 2018-04-26 18:44:36 si aumentan los costos la oferta se contrae  o la produccion al mismo precio cae. si los costos no se modifican y el precio no baja aumentarian los stocks que es lo que sucede en la realidad. Y cuando habla de precios habla de precios relativos no del precio en pesos.

650 2018-04-26 17:50:12 Yep, freedom of speech just so long as that speech meets with our criteria. If not well there is lots of room at the Tower of London..stocks haven't been used in a few years
651 2018-04-26 17:49:53 This is a freaking joke.

655 2018-04-26 17:49:15 While so many in the mkt have fought very hard to capture the last 300 odd points of the nifty move, positional traders of the broader mkt indices have had the last laugh. Stocks backed with nos have done 15-30% just like that.

664 2018-04-26 17:44:15 I continue to believe it is a bull market. The downturn has been just under what is technically a correction when looking at global stocks. So we’re getting more length/duration to jaundice the skittish. (1/2)
665 2018-04-26 17:43:18 Obama pleaded with legislators on a dozen occasions, and they refused to vote in stricter gun laws to reduce the gun violence. Trump hasn’t even done that much, and it’s having a huge impact on the country. The company who makes bump stocks is shutting themselves down.

668 2018-04-26 17:40:50 That's my whole point hate speech to one person wouldn't be considered hate speech by someone else. That's why disciplining someone for hate speech is dumb because it's impossible to agree on what is hate speech and what isn't
669 2018-04-26 17:40:21 The stocks-and-flows is still “machine” thinking, reductionistic. Feedback requires focus on interaction of the system with its environment.

684 2018-04-26 17:34:30 I've said that before about accounts only to be proven wrong.  There are a lot of people who are just playing these penny stocks for a lottery ticket.  Generally the same people who buy actual lottery tickets.

687 2018-04-26 17:32:37 I think its a function of penny stocks sucking liquidity out of the blue chips for the get rich quick scheme, which, I believe many ALTS go to zero in the next 12-24 months.  The "thinning" will commence soon.

694 2018-04-26 17:30:02 I mean- it’s kind of inspiring that a group of people realized that could play the stock market in a world where there would never be more shares and Wall Street assures them their stocks won’t ever devalue, so they can buy all they want and face zero consequences.
695 2018-04-26 17:28:46 I think the volume is not good for index and many stocks.

706 2018-04-26 17:25:31 Penny stocks - reward or loss. In my early years I did a few but only paid off by extensive research & chance. They only report truth to S.E.C.

786 2018-04-26 16:51:04 Hey @SinisterlyRich our stocks just fell 2%. Not sure why, I'm looking into it, just giving you a heads up.
787 2018-04-26 16:50:37 What stocks you invested in?
788 2018-04-26 16:50:04 I’m counting down to 18 just so I can buy stocks
789 2018-04-26 16:49:58 Comparing these stocks is probably the most difficult shit I’ve done so far
790 2018-04-26 16:49:34 Making a bold call and say ''stocks will fill the opening gaps!''
791 2018-04-26 16:48:56 Since you could sell stocks for shitcoins, obviously!

797 2018-04-26 16:45:16 So if I input my postcode (PE3 8LH) into the search engine it tells me that ASDA in Peterborough stocks the Cauliflower pizza. In store they claim never to have heard of this Company. So something is not right!
798 2018-04-26 16:44:52 Tell me about it Jim. I bought stocks with good dividends and contributed 300$ every month until I was out of work at 57 yrs of age. Thank goodness I had the forsight.
799 2018-04-26 16:44:50 A2 I wonder if naming & shaming is more of a U.S. thing?  You know, the "put them in the stocks" mentality.  Is this also apparent in other countries? #luxtravelchat
800 2018-04-26 16:44:33 They never held any Banks or financial stocks in their portfolio which are in public domain. Doubt they hold it.
801 2018-04-26 16:42:53 In a bull market, bad news are ignored or even taken as good news. 
In a bear market, even good news are interpreted as bad news. The last one is what we are starting to see lately. More than solid earning on some companies but the stocks are crashing.

812 2018-04-26 16:36:30 The ads I get on Instagram are now basically 100% ads for men's basics (t-Shirts, underwear, stocks etc.) and I think pretty much each one has a quote from a GQ article saying the startup has invented the softest/best fitting version of their category.
813 2018-04-26 16:35:54 I have work picking peaches & apples no thank you! Ford is moving its plants to China. GE is moving jobs to Mexico. G.M. is already in China & is the only dealership and Venezuela. I just don't see the tax breaks for themiddle class. Most can't afford to invest in stocks
814 2018-04-26 16:35:33 Gundlach - Your credibility in stocks is totally destroyed. Facebook is up +9.5% today after earnings. Don’t try to talk about stocks when you clearly don’t know shit!

823 2018-04-26 16:31:54 The 26th of the month is usually a bullish day, Jan 26th set the Dow’s current record at 26,616. Probably a good day to ring the cash register and sell some stocks, maybe a good day to buy puts.

829 2018-04-26 16:28:24 You’re saying the stocks weren’t low?
Honestly mate, they really were, and some still are!
Fishermen throw fish back if they can catch more valuable fish too!
we sell 70%+ of landed catch to the EU, which is why Grimsby wants a special deal as they know they’re screwed otherwise!
830 2018-04-26 16:27:57 I.e. we would all put Mariguas, Wizzrobe, etc in the same tier as Boom, however they would remain at the bottom of the tier with Boom at the top of the tier. 4-5 stocks is an insurance policy that allows Boom to keep winning Game 5 last stock. He is 99-1. Our ruleset enables it.

833 2018-04-26 16:27:35 I encourage y’all to invest y’alls money in stocks.
834 2018-04-26 16:27:05 Didn’t see it TBH. What’s wrong with dividend stocks?
835 2018-04-26 16:26:36 With BUYING ON MARGIN everyone can afford a stock in The Ford Motor Company. It is like buying on credit but with stocks! All stocks are rising rapidly #BULLMARKET
836 2018-04-26 16:26:30 3 stocks 6 minutes simply shifts the word ALL to the word MOST. A player a tier above does not lose to a tier below under this. The better player still wins MOST of the time, and still a significant most, like 90-10 not 55-45. Problem now is within tiers, better plays win 99-1.
837 2018-04-26 16:25:55 Fair.  Just seems dumb to mock somebody for suggesting dividend stocks.  Could be a lot worse.
838 2018-04-26 16:25:29 Stocks higher soon after the opening bell.
839 2018-04-26 16:25:09 After a busy winter, Basics Bank food stocks are getting very low.

Tinned Hot Meat, Tinned Cold Meat, Spreads, Tinned Potatoes, Noodles, Rice Pudding/Custard.
840 2018-04-26 16:25:07 Rates back away from 3.03 and stabilize, earnings blowout on cheap stocks, kudlow says no trade war.... What do you see?
841 2018-04-26 16:24:11 Yeap. Once @RobinhoodApp allows deposit and withdraw, this will be my go-to app for all stocks and crypto buys. Until then I'm not touching it.
842 2018-04-26 16:23:29 Funny to see Bill O'Reilly getting trolled because he suggested dividend stocks (almost everyone ever asked for a stock tip has done the same), while the crypto fans seem to get off easier
843 2018-04-26 16:23:25 This actually makes it harder for gimp heavy characters since gimps typically require 1 or 2 more reads whereas combo heavy characters (most low/mid tiers) don't need to rely on multiple neutral wins and so with less stocks they can cover their neutral margin deficiencies better.
844 2018-04-26 16:22:40 Bought $T 32.80
845 2018-04-26 16:22:12 Amazing how quickly everyone all bulled up again and FANG stocks going ape shit to the upside
846 2018-04-26 16:22:11 Believe me, I have. Also the library. They also don't have any Jemisin, which is probably even less forgivable if only due to her Hugo success. My guess is the manager just doesn't care about the genre, and only stocks what sells easily.
847 2018-04-26 16:22:09 All good stocks mate. Invested in them for a reason so hold your nerve.
848 2018-04-26 16:21:28 Good day to put on some cheap strangles on beta stocks today with $AMZN reporting.

852 2018-04-26 16:20:04 An Ibanez TS808 Tube Screamer pedal for $40 in '86 will get you $900-$1200 in 2018, or $400-$550 in '86 dollars. That's 11%/year, equal to the stock market. Instead of investing in stocks, become a gear head.

854 2018-04-26 16:19:21 Respected Prime Minister Sir.There is huge manipulation in NCLT stocks in allowing the new promoters to take 90 to 98 percent stake as SEBI allows only a maximum of 75 % stake and kill the small retail investors of the country.Please look into the matter urgently.Thank you.

862 2018-04-26 16:16:58 IIRC, the term "middle class" was coined to divert attention from the upper class's income, which is almost entirely unearned (stocks, dividends, etc). Calling the working class 'middle class' ignores earned/unearned income and makes people think class mobility still exists.
863 2018-04-26 16:16:46 wall street firms and fund managers destroying stocks on a regular basis daily and for the last 9 months. Complete SCAM,  ? poltical. Financial press following the political press with complete garbage
864 2018-04-26 16:14:09 #stocks#ThursdayThoughts Unlike Herbert Hoover who pulled US investments out of post World War I Germany making the depression worse, we see central bankers  and the IMF desperately  trying to prop up dying fiat currencies. You bet it could be far worse than 1929.

871 2018-04-26 16:12:12 Not unfavourably. In EM EQ, a fund that doesn’t just own the top 20 stocks starts to look more attractive

910 2018-04-26 15:55:03 Yes I know, but we tempted to bad fat junks like Samosa, Burger ....The same way we tempted towards high growth stocks without verifying it's healthier or not.
911 2018-04-26 15:54:21 Good but value realisation won't be easy .. My simple criterion is the free cash a business generates and pays dividend as well.. Thats the return i seek, not selling off to some poor sod with a profit.. i hold stocks

913 2018-04-26 15:53:22 The 10 largest stocks in 2000 represented 25% of the S&P – MSFT, CSCO, INTC, IBM, AOL, DELL, SUNW, QCOM & HPQ. Over the next 18 years, not a single one beat the market. You like apples?
914 2018-04-26 15:52:16 Sometimes I'll be in the bathroom getting ready & a good column idea randomly comes to mind, so I end up writing all these jumbled notes on my phone that I later have to decipher 
915 2018-04-26 15:51:41 It's cheap is still not an argument for buying. I've lost more money by buying low-multiple stocks than I ever did in high flyers. There are usually good reasons that a security has been assigned a low p/e.

933 2018-04-26 15:42:52 That's an intriguing take on what's going on. I, too, feel that sentiment and irrationality are playing more of a role than usual for this current rout. It feels like people want to prove that Pres. Trump shouldn't have been elected by bidding stocks down.

954 2018-04-26 15:33:11 Wrong way to look at it: US has the largest amount of commercial crude storage in the world. It’s also the cheapest in the world to store. US crude exports are for consumption. So if you are drawing stocks from the cheapest storage depots you know it’s getting tight....

975 2018-04-26 15:20:36 Market turmoil may be linked to volatility leading to further boost in High Frequency Trading and within institutions. inked to the incredible&broad retreat in stocks from the “fat finger” trading in future contracts.

976 2018-04-26 15:20:19 It’s not the same. The stocks you are referring to are traded on major exchanges and must adhere to costly and complex regulations and reporting requirements for public companies.

1058 2018-04-26 14:50:13 I think this is one of the big stories in ETFs right now.  FWIW, I think a big chunk of it comes from ETFs "fund-izing" parts of the ecosystem that used to be played with single stocks (e.g., the rise of thematic investing). The pie of assets that are held in funds is growing.

The lazy approach to active investing isn't easy in practice, especially when a couple of stocks go to sleep for 3-4 years! 

As long as the original premise of the investment holds, it's fine.

1424 2018-04-26 12:20:18 Because idiots like you think that a pistol grip, hand guard, butt stocks and “high capacity” magazines (even though they’re standard from the factory with 30 rounds) help make a weapon more lethal. So we joke about the terminology that left makes up. #themoreyouknow

1532 2018-04-26 11:03:34 I can’t wait till this investigation is over and NOTHING HAPPENS! When the news breaks, rope, razor and sleeping pill stocks will go through the roof, buy yours now. Happy Birthday #FLOTUS
1533 2018-04-26 11:03:10 Thanks. Now the question is how to use this info. May be investing in index based stocks
1534 2018-04-26 11:02:09 “Bull market corrections...very different...than...start of bear markets. We define a 'bull correction' as a drawdown of 10% or more...with a recovery to the prior peak within 12 months. A 'bear market'...stocks sell off 20% or more...no recovery in 12 months”

1535 2018-04-26 11:01:00 Do you buy your stocks on your smart phone? How many trades do you average per month?
1536 2018-04-26 11:00:03 Horseshit. I've invested for years, thoroughly learn how to use anything before putting my $$$ into it. Like EVERY investor on Earth!

1538 2018-04-26 10:57:56 Once the big money continues to unload into good news and the algos are adjusted to finally see bad price actions as bad and not a buying opportunity, the markets will be in big big trouble. I think we are getting close! #stocks #nasdaq #NYSE

1540 2018-04-26 10:56:56 Your argument is a tired one though. I was told to "suck it up, buttercup" when Obama was POTUS. I suggest you do the same with Trump.
1541 2018-04-26 10:55:14 I'm explaining why some of your friends and loved ones may have taken your Trump support personally.

Core point: Trump isn't a dude with some bad ideas; he's a dude who ran on promises to hurt certain demographics conservatives don't like, and LGBT folks are one them.

1739 2018-04-26 07:45:00 I see. For a trade? As an investor I'd always go for fundamentals first as this is the strongest proponent of a sustained positive move, then search for technicals to look for entry points. There's usually a good fundamental reason stocks are beat up and at a low.

Dear All,

The interns running the Algos are shorting stocks after positive earnings and forecasts.

This austerity stance is cutting finance from future projects.

1906 2018-04-26 04:37:39 Agree. If we are not 100% sure of business then AlMOST ALWAYS it's better to buy stocks when they are trading near to 52 week high than 52 week low.

2092 2018-04-26 02:31:41 An AR-15 is practically identical to a handgun excluding the size. Bump stocks are illegal. There's already vetting, (depending on state) require a license which you have to renew, Monitoring ammo wouldn't do anything. Strict rules for storage is actually a valid point.

2117 2018-04-26 02:13:58 Bump fire stocks do not rig it to be automatic, it just increases the speed of the "action" of the rifle.(one trigger squeeze=1bullet) Also, depending on the type of bolt you have you're more likely to over heat your rifle and jam.

2150 2018-04-26 01:46:42 Sometimes you just need a vacation from stocks.

When Andrew Carnegie's oil investment was going no where, he sold a portion for a 77% loss. He couldn't sell the rest, so he went to England for vacation. During his absence the co. struck oil. It eventually became a 45x bagger.

2153 2018-04-26 01:43:33 Any experience how ur confidence didn't break during 2008 crash when 50-60 pc was wiped out even in large cap quality stocks. Mine broke looking at the way they fell. Equity as an asset class seemed untrustworthy.

2155 2018-04-26 01:40:02 U.S. is the only country in the world that offers a 30 yr mortgage. So I would lock that in bc there is an increasing probability that it won’t be offered if Fannie&Freddie are wound down. Would also move from fiscally irresponsible states.

2162 2018-04-26 01:30:46 So, I decided to do an earnings trade today in $AMD. 

I sold the 9.5/10 strangle for .75 in the options that expire this Friday. 

With where $AMD is at, I’m like at a scratch trade basically, since it’s near my break-even.

On twitter, some people are always throwing up names of their stocks. 

Just shows that they don't have much confidence in their holding! 

Experienced guys never do that as more people investing in ur stock might raise prices & hinder accumulation
2171 2018-04-26 01:22:51 $25 which is a deal imo but most of the time my area stocks a lot of ABH, Stila and KVD which I’m grateful for

2188 2018-04-26 01:05:47 Your manners (and I am not talking about the formal, stuffy kind) are one of the most valuable assets you own.

Invest wisely—rudeness is quite the risky investment.

I hear kindness and basic respect are the hot stocks to buy now for that long-term, high-yield coin.

2198 2018-04-26 00:55:55 Interesting. If true, now is a great time to start buying these fundamentally sound and cash rich companies’ stocks. The recent down Trend does seem to be over sold. The negative impact from Inflation or int rates is not going to be proportional to the loss in stock value. So buy

2221 2018-04-26 00:32:24 No, that is a fact. For one, President only has so much influence on the markets. For two, they gained at the same rate under Obama as Trump. Just look at the historical graphs. If your personal stocks did worse/better that’s just randomness. Overall, similar growth

2239 2018-04-26 00:11:48 The long term trend is still up and stocks consolidated the rally from 2017. Without some shocking news, new highs with weakening breadth and growth leadership are made before the trends turn.
