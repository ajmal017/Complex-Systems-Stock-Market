6 2018-06-05 23:55:33 Just a word of caution to the new comer. If some sales video tells you they have made millions of dollars trading stocks/options with a few simple strategies at home, part time in their  pajamas then why do they need some BS video selling their BS strategy? Stay away it's a scam!

40 2018-06-05 23:43:33 I could paint you a picture of 'wha-happnd' but you still couldn't see it. Read what happened in Davos in 2005. This was a 'planned event' that started with sub-prime loans, short oil stocks and fake gold prices. Get a clue. Globalists tried to destroy America. O was a plant.
41 2018-06-05 23:39:38 Oh now they are malicious.  Scary almost as bad as a mass shooter. Are bump stocks banned yet? No
42 2018-06-05 23:39:24 The cool thing with hatchets is that it limits the scope of the violence whereas with an assault rifle and a few bump stocks, I can sit in a hotel room and scattershot bullets on crowds of people below killing dozens.

53 2018-06-05 23:32:00 Illinois yesterday passed bills banning bump stocks, instituting 3-day wait to purchase assault. Rifles, and raised the age for that from 18 to 21. Proud of Illinois!
54 2018-06-05 23:31:59 There are no natural born investors. Some intellect and skepticism are needed, but temperament is far more critical. Buy good companies when they sell at a discount. Hold for the long term to let compounding do its magic. You can do this.

55 2018-06-05 23:30:32 Ban bump stocks! There is no place in home, self defense or hunting for these weapons of war.

73 2018-06-05 23:16:08 just stocks right now, until I can become a non-smoker then I will learn options. I'm on my first day of trying to stop, and it's going to be a long road. Hey, too long to write this out, so I'll message you real quick.
74 2018-06-05 23:15:36 Is it just take the knee? we in England like also throw rotten fruit & vegetables at treasons People ..whilst there in the stocks prior to be heading! I bet King George sounds like a good idea now ;)
75 2018-06-05 23:15:10 The rich pay more taxes because they have confiscated most of the wealth. Benefits & pay have decreased for the people who work to make them rich. Pensions were abused and plundered by them as were the stocks. They made more money when the average person lost their life savings.
76 2018-06-05 23:15:00 Then for the love of God, sell the damned things and open a TFSA with either stocks or, for low maintenance gains, mutual funds in it. If you pay even just yearly attention to your investments, 8% is a conservative rate of return.
77 2018-06-05 23:14:13 Expect an increase in that since #Veterans with chronic pain are being denied medication. Check out our FDA Dr Scott Gillespie and see how he made his millions. Now hes targeting the 20 drug co. He had stocks in, 
78 2018-06-05 23:13:56 Most think of me as a short term momentum/swing trader but what many don't know is members often like my select stocks for their longer term IRA also.

80 2018-06-05 23:13:23 For your chart settings do you leave extended session hours ‘on’?  I ask since the 30m cloud top u mentioned occurs when the extended session trading is included. I usually keep that off for stocks vs futures but wondered about your thoughts?

103 2018-06-05 22:58:39 I have always tried to look at  stocks and the broad markets from the perspective of railroad cars and railroad tracks. To get where you want to go, it takes evaluating both. What is the use of a really good fast train if the tracks are crappy?

118 2018-06-05 22:48:37 Have to admit tho, you could take all my cash, stocks and take away my income and I could still pay my bills and meet my obligations for a year with my PMs. And I would feel pretty fragile without that.

It feels like a bubble. 

And i feel i should not buy anymore.
143 2018-06-05 22:35:17 $snes should be interesting tomorrow, holding a few shares overnight we'll see how it plays out #daytrading #stocks #stockstowatch 
144 2018-06-05 22:34:00 In a business-as-usual scenario, the ocean is expected to contain 1 tonne of plastic for every 3 tonnes of fish by 2025, and by 2050, more plastics than fish (by weight). Sadly, since fish stocks are also collapsing this may happen much earlier.
145 2018-06-05 22:30:22 From the 24 #stocks in technology sector that yesterday set all-time highs, picked these:
$AAPL, $VEEV, $CTXS, $SAP, $CRM, $EA, $SHOP, $ADP, $TEAM, $MSFT, $INTU, $SQ
146 2018-06-05 22:28:54 OMG I’m sorry I’d have to go through all the material I’ve researched and count, he reminded me of John Gotti,another “Teflon Don”I’ll count em up and get back to you, must’ve had your head in the sand , you do remember that he made bump stocks legal.
147 2018-06-05 22:27:01 As someone who works in a store that stocks tons of new merch for every new Star Wars film that comes out I fully support this idea
148 2018-06-05 22:26:46 I don’t watch “Fast Money,” but it is the very definition of The Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex, which tends to keep us - by turns -credulous, grandiose, and pessimistic in our view of stocks.

151 2018-06-05 22:26:14 Look this is a whole lot to see at once I spent hrs and sometimes yrs to see this crazy stuff and realize what is going on! I am so sorry but this has to come out !! This has to stop it's dangerous!! To not only us but all countries!! It has caused wars! Stocks to drop! For lies!
152 2018-06-05 22:25:22 The best stocks tend to be leaders in their fields and compete in markets with solid growth prospects. And these stocks often are relatively expensive because investors think highly of their prospects.
153 2018-06-05 22:25:05 @MarckZuckReal what u need to do is sell @facebook & come up with something new. Let me know when you've evolve. Until than I'll be on @YouTube Sidenote: I need to sell my Facebook stocks on @RobinhoodApp Useless

155 2018-06-05 22:23:32 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons
156 2018-06-05 22:22:48 But NOT universal checks, or banning assault weapons of war, or bump stocks. Obama tried and McConnell and Ryan would even put it up for a vote. Even tho 72 % of Americans want this. Keep your guns I believe in the 2A but not the things I listed above
157 2018-06-05 22:21:51 Those little green stocks have got to go!
158 2018-06-05 22:20:54 i have question where diversify your profits from #bitcoin $btc and other #altcoins ? for example i put some profits aside to estate in flat on cyprus,flat england and house in my home country. now thinking about villa in koh samui. and keeping some stocks like $mu $amzn $tsla
159 2018-06-05 22:20:34 I waxed cars, mowed lawns, delivered news papers, was a bus boy, worked in a super market, worked for my friends pool company, did wrestling, football and lacrosse. Also invested in stocks.

169 2018-06-05 22:17:35 Love how you guys are, how should I put it, "a head of the curve", on some stocks....great technical analysis to buy and sit back to watch the growth. Nice job
170 2018-06-05 22:17:07 Do teams get to take over their whole investment portfolios or just their stocks?
171 2018-06-05 22:16:46 Of all the crimes to bring back the "stocks" for,  this would be high on my list.

180 2018-06-05 22:09:24 You seems you are not getting my question....401k i know is for my employer, but if i need to do personal online trading do I need to use 401k log in or I do need to open another account for me to do personal online trading to purchase some stocks either on DOW or NASDAQ?
181 2018-06-05 22:08:12 THIS!!! RT @Tusslindo: What app y’all use to trade stocks cuz this working to make a Mil ain’t working for me.
182 2018-06-05 22:08:05 Of course they do. They end when everyone is in. Same for any other bull market. More people buying bonds right now than stocks.

189 2018-06-05 22:03:32 Oh you can short many stocks soon. I’m going to enjoy shorting Tesla just for the sake of it when the time is right.
190 2018-06-05 22:03:30 Hey mate you are a fantastic reporter at the @TheStreet and a great analytic with all the stocks but I really thing that you’ve an obsession with @elonmusk. What he is doing ok but what is he wearing... who cares???
191 2018-06-05 22:00:21 Bump stocks is nothing. Criminals still get guns. Reminds me of Hitler when he told people to hand in their guns. First it starts with bump stocks. Your not getting voted back in anyway so you’ve accomplished nothing. Your a criminal.
192 2018-06-05 22:00:09 @Tom_Stocks strange question. Do you or have you ever lived in Effra ct? As there is a post card to someone with your name in the lobby.
193 2018-06-05 22:00:05 89 days until I go on holiday and I’m sat eating like a fat pig that I am, not angry in myself just disappointed
194 2018-06-05 21:58:26 Banning bump stocks and large capacity mags could potentially save lives in mass shooting situations, no? Wouldn’t even one less person killed be worth that? And why are they necessary in the first place? Hunting?
195 2018-06-05 21:57:00 Did you learn about credit, 401K, Roth IRA or stocks/investing in school? If not is it because your school didn’t provide information or did you not pay attention?

200 2018-06-05 21:54:46 It’s only because they think big drug runners with millions of #tainted money are behind the biggest investors. So what, the stocks are legal!  Still looking through those #ProhibitionColoredGlasses. Everywhere that they see a #cannabis connection, they see criminals!

203 2018-06-05 21:53:35 So.... cemex is owned by a billionaire Mexican. Cemex properties have been hiding children of human trafficking. George Soros, billionaire, owns most of the stocks in cemex. Celebrities and Congress members, millionaires, are involved in human trafficking. See a pattern here?
204 2018-06-05 21:49:37 When you use fund flows to estimate behavior gaps, a clear pattern emerges: 
Single stocks > concentrated/theme funds > diversified active funds > diversified passive funds > TDFs > Managed accounts. The behavior gaps on TDFs/MA's are tiny.
205 2018-06-05 21:47:55 Kate spade stocks just skyrocketed... I’m sure.
206 2018-06-05 21:47:43 Let’s talk about wasting money... u gave people who already have money a huge tax cut and they’re just buying back their stocks; now that deficit is cutting into OUR SS and Medicare that we pay into each check! These are not entitlement programs, we pay for them! GTFO of OUR WH!
207 2018-06-05 21:46:18 Yeah, same :<. I luck out cause I live near a Kinokuniya, which stocks a bunch of blind boxes. Sometimes, they have opened ones in a little section, so you can see what you are getting.

212 2018-06-05 21:42:58 @JamesGRickards I read that QT is $50 billion a month but stock buyback by companies is $200 billion. That will provide price support for stocks, won't it? Will stock buybacks end before QT?
213 2018-06-05 21:42:28 If showed you guys stocks that I look at on twitter (not youtube) would you be interested? I'm bearish on the stock market as well, but it looks too bullish at the moment not to long certain equities.

218 2018-06-05 21:40:29 The economy is good for people who own stocks.  Most Americans down own stocks.
219 2018-06-05 21:39:46 Ban bump stocks
220 2018-06-05 21:39:14 Why do you say he is against 2nd amendment rights? They are against semi automatic AR-15’s, bump stocks, all they want is those two things banned and common sense rules,waiting period and good background checks. Saying they are against the 2nd amendment is just not true
221 2018-06-05 21:38:54 Trade accounts only count goods shipped across borders. A trade deficit is the dollars used to buy goods (investments) for use inside the US, and financial investments in US stocks and bonds.
A trade deficit is fgns investing more in the US than the US in the fgn country.

227 2018-06-05 21:36:04 #WSJ page 1 tech stocks surge. Isn’t this the industry you’re at war with. Including amazon and Facebook. Is this the economy your promoting. I’m sure they are not in favor of immigration reform.
228 2018-06-05 21:34:49 Mike, wealth is not destroyed, just changes hands, and this is the objective, #crypto is another wealth-trendier scheme like stocks, currencies, etc. Money flows from naive speculators to insiders.
229 2018-06-05 21:33:53 .... Still confused though. So do you believe all guns should be allowed or just a few. For instance bump stocks and other accessories that turn single fire rifles into auto fire rifles, do you believe that should be allowed?

237 2018-06-05 21:32:02 Seems,,worst stocks to own in this bull market financial stocks / banks. Interest rates won't be climbing as fast as some thought or limited hikes. Besides, internal for many financial stocks, have their own concerns.

249 2018-06-05 21:22:55 What are people resisting? Ending a possible large scale 50 year old conflict with NK? Or RECORD unemployment? Or stocks trading at the highest ever? The fact that they CAN resist tells everything.
250 2018-06-05 21:22:54 And cite a source (actual valid one) that bump stocks actually increase rate of fire and don't ruin accuracy. IE they're just toys and stupid ones at that.

I'm investing in Xanax stocks.
The mid-term bloodbath coming for Leftist loons mean they will be more traumatized than they were the evening of Nov. 8th.
They're going to need strong medication.
254 2018-06-05 21:15:51 Another thing to keep in mind is that stocks in a long-term downtrend will not turn around overnight. Once they hit bottom, they will establish a base, which gives you plenty of time to buy at that point.
255 2018-06-05 21:15:04 “Bump stocks, we are writing that out. I am writing that out,” he said, addressing a group of state governors at the White House. “I don’t care if Congress does it or not, I’m writing it out myself."
256 2018-06-05 21:14:54 We need more stocks like this. I'd like to invest more towards 401k. Less restrictions maybe

259 2018-06-05 21:11:41 Even more sad is the fact that the one time a M4 in full auto is gonna outkill an AR-15 is a Vegas like situation, but fortunately for massacrers, bump stocks are still perfectly legal and can turn a basic AR-15 into something just as good at killing in that situation as an M4
260 2018-06-05 21:10:48 Universal background checks, ban to bump stocks, magazines with capacity Larger than 10, and assault rifles/semi auto Rifles from sale. I can already tell that from the title and it having a right wing bias that information is either opinionated or a figment of the truth.
261 2018-06-05 21:09:36 Nice trade today on $IQ using giudlines I learned from @SmashTheBid under over $28 soon as it reclaimed went long. Good stuff to bad I gave it back shorting $DCPH.

262 2018-06-05 21:09:15 Then ban assault weapons and honor them. Praise isn't progress. No person should own firearms that can out gun a cop unless it's kept at the precinct, and allowed to be used in case of emergency or Target practice or hunting, no questions asked. No bump stocks.
263 2018-06-05 21:08:55 Hiltzik and David Lazarus both write weekly columns on the million different ways capitalism hurts people and the LA Times just tucks them into the business section next to the stocks and commodity price updates like it’s not contradictory at all. It rules.

289 2018-06-05 21:00:03 I’m glad the stocks went down, and I knew they would. That ceiling got WAYYYY too high
290 2018-06-05 20:59:03 Lots of FOOLish stocks up big this year.  Lots of them in my portfolio as well.  It's been a good 5+ months in this "overheated" market.
291 2018-06-05 20:58:54 Fair point on the confidence of the people. Even if confidence in Trump helping the stocks is a myth,  Trump certainly didn't scare people into plummeting #'s as some predicted.
292 2018-06-05 20:58:02 Excuse me by 10k on stocks.   See how easy it is to correct mis info? ? Try it sometime.
293 2018-06-05 20:57:57 Once again more half truths of the facts and real stories by the liberal media. The NASDAQ stocks set an all-time high, yet the only story being covered is the NFL Eagles being univited after the majority of team players declined to attend.
294 2018-06-05 20:57:51 When they showed the Stocks app on macOS at first it was also white! and it looked more like opening Yahoo Finance to me... Had a sigh of relief when they introduced the macOS Dark Mode lol I guess the are working on dark modes for iOS to be released with new hardware in Sep.
295 2018-06-05 20:56:42 Now that markets have recovered it is a good time to sit down and plan what you will do the next time volatility picks up. Because it is just a matter of when, not if.

300 2018-06-05 20:52:53 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you would? Are you afraid of the NRA? #FailForceOne
301 2018-06-05 20:52:28 Why is the Stocks app light theme on iPad and dark theme on iPhone?
302 2018-06-05 20:52:24 It's on track..The economy of last 8 years increased stocks by 20k and jobs and HC increased by  over 10 million headcount each. Tariffs are not necesssry. u r trying tit for tat with allies. We should be sharing/ not daring. That's the Christian way.

304 2018-06-05 20:50:10 This is a side point but based upon your statement. My stocks have been doing well (and probably yours too) since March 2009. I dont really credit any president. But if we are we must talk about gas prices and the trade war.

326 2018-06-05 20:40:24 They paid the 7B USD in newly issued stocks. So their shareholders basically paid for it by having their shares diluted... So they don't need GitHub to make money, just the market has to think that MS+Github is more valuable than MS itself.

332 2018-06-05 20:35:57 Holding to stocks for longer term must be one of the hardest things to do.. but based on my experience, that's the best thing you can do. Buy quality Stocks. Keep monitoring them periodically. Load when they fall down

337 2018-06-05 20:35:27 Not sure if you agree, but I found multiple stocks on my watchlist going back and forth quite a bit, without technically indicating a direction.
338 2018-06-05 20:35:13 I will never understand why people short stocks going straight up. I just will never understand. That’s ok.
339 2018-06-05 20:34:43 You do know that the military has access to weapons you do not, right? Do you advocate that we should be allowed to own armor, missles? Also, the military doesn't need bump stocks, and no one mentioned sights, so that is strawman.

341 2018-06-05 20:32:04 It's a meaningless euphemism.

"It's not a stock market, it's a market of stocks" is another great one.

368 2018-06-05 20:13:11 I've stated this before as well. I am sympathetic to what you advocate, but its not a practical solution to be implemented into my family for various reasons. I don't care what your opinion of the matter is. We eat fish, but probably use more stocks with fish-derived bases.

378 2018-06-05 20:09:04 So you finally break your own rules? What happen to that "only investing in dividend paying stocks" principle? Now you construct an ETF investing in high flying stocks like $AMZN & $NFLX.

404 2018-06-05 19:54:29 Hoping that comes soon. Like within the next two weeks, but I'm confident it will, because it did with the last two stocks that I left early, but that's not really a definite indicator. Only thing it indicates is that I should hold

409 2018-06-05 19:52:48 @TMFJMo Glad I got to meet you at Takoda on Wed night. I’m gonna pitch a medical stock to you - IRTC. I bought it several months ago & it’s done well. Give it a look see for your telemedicine basket of stocks.
410 2018-06-05 19:52:12 What a racist
411 2018-06-05 19:52:11 what with 0.0250 off the ask and bid?
412 2018-06-05 19:51:54 #tggi Canada votes on the 7th once they vote legal. USA stocks will start to go nuts as they want that money as much as Canada will start to make.Slap the ask folks, let the bid sitters sit in the bleachers.
413 2018-06-05 19:51:52 thanks but stocks have been heading down for a while.
414 2018-06-05 19:49:35 Moreover, imagine us explaining our kids how we used to wait days to get a transfer done, or how the banks used to work until 3pm, or how the stocks were not tradable during weekends...just pure nonsense 
415 2018-06-05 19:48:42 SEBI introduced Additional Surveillance Measure #ASM this year in consultation with exchanges as part of enhanced surveillance mechanism.

420 2018-06-05 19:45:41 The entire country should ban bump stocks. Hope you have luck and I hope you file charges against the idiot who had your house SWATED. Hire a great cut throat attorney, file a formal complaint, and ruin their lives forever.

422 2018-06-05 19:45:07 Chyrons! I forgot what they were called! 

it’s like you are trying to pay attention to the person talking but below them are headlines, weather report, sports scores, stocks, an inset screen of a live feed somewhere, what’s coming up, breaking news. It’s fucking exhausting.
423 2018-06-05 19:43:31 Ban bump stocks and AR15s, close loopholes.

428 2018-06-05 19:37:35 All those other UTXOs will trend to 0.001BTC or less. Think of them as penny stocks but worse.
429 2018-06-05 19:37:17 People with "lots of money in the bank" usually do that ONLY after investments in real estate, bonds, stocks, and commodities (usually in that order) have paid off. And it's these people who CAUSE (or at least benefit from) inflation. Wage earners rarely get COLAs.
430 2018-06-05 19:36:29 Bump stocks must be banned!

460 2018-06-05 19:18:52 Lool you haven’t really looked into investments in depth. You need to look up short selling stocks.
461 2018-06-05 19:18:28 Good question. That's it had a big run, no doubt.
At least for me, I don't want to get in front of it.
Alot of these stocks have had incredible runs, and yet they still continue going.

In full disclosure, I'm short the 25 put in IQ with 45DTE.
462 2018-06-05 19:18:01 OH! Thought you were referring to individual players, in which case players don't have any real say on the stocks in tourneys.

464 2018-06-05 19:16:11 No as a layman I understand that the priblem is amongst other things created by China selling their cheap good produced be cheap labour to the US.. and  investing the revenue in US stocks and bonds.. keeping the dollar high and the Yen low.. their products low.. US products high
465 2018-06-05 19:16:10 None. I would never go long this stock now, its in a downtrend in the late day, my system gives high probability trades with low risk setups only, dip buying down trending stocks is risky and doesn't give consistent results. Id definitely leave it for this afternoon IMO. Cheers!

533 2018-06-05 18:38:34 Stocks are ignoring many possibly negative near-term events/risks: #TradeWar, #Mueller, #NK, #WageInflation, @federalreserve, higher discount rates, late-cycle margin squeeze, etc. The fact that there are large buybacks is synonymous with the #TaxCut, which should be priced in...
534 2018-06-05 18:37:52 There are not really many, Denison and Energy Fuels are on Crest and can be purchased in GBP/Euro, maybe others but I have these individually.  Plus of course you can buy all the main overseas Uranium stocks which are also available in SIPP's or an ISA.
535 2018-06-05 18:36:40 $SPX $SPY $QQQ if we can close out this week strong and @realDonaldTrump can keep his mouth shut, it appears that all the economic data can launch us higher. Starting to feel like Jan again. China stocks were also taking off.  A lot feels similar. Possible measured move to $2875
536 2018-06-05 18:35:50 Tech stocks aren’t meant to make sense in the traditional sense
537 2018-06-05 18:35:49 Half of Americans own no stocks in ANY form (per the Fed).  Only 14% or so own individual shares.  I completely agree that the economy is on fire for some Americans, just not for most.
538 2018-06-05 18:35:49 Do you think that the Skua’s are also responsible for the decline in other seabirds..From my skant knowledge they now prey on others as fish stocks low?

@WHALES_org
539 2018-06-05 18:35:36 Agree, something is really bad in finance sector.. Stocks are down a lot and sitting at baseline.
540 2018-06-05 18:34:47 Banning bump stocks & large magazines is long overdue. Guns should also be locked in a gun safe to protect children.
 North as head of the NRA shows what a joke they have become. Once upon a time they stood for gun safety, now they buy politicians for gun sales.

543 2018-06-05 18:33:49 Then why is it that the stocks I own happen to be worth less than they were in December of last year?
544 2018-06-05 18:33:35 Ban bump stocks and things that make them
545 2018-06-05 18:33:05 So, @CumulusMedia, are those of us who took a chance and bought shares of #CMLSQ SOL? Happy you emerged from bankruptcy but didn’t think I’d lose all my shares. Will they not convert to #CMIA and eventually #CMLS and if not, why? #stocks

547 2018-06-05 18:32:25 I agree with that you can't remove then guns from areas but you can restrict certain guns from being bought.  For instance the Vegas shooting the guy had bump stocks.
548 2018-06-05 18:32:25 Bought at IPO cos I only like stocks i “use” (usually a disastrous investment principle!) - but glad to see this climbing back up steadily. Will go higher as on Fortune 500 trading lists now.
549 2018-06-05 18:32:11 My stocks went up
550 2018-06-05 18:32:00 Plz need to know. Is there any changes on ASM stocks...
Somewhere read now. That some will be in t2t. Amd some will be in open...?
Plz anybody reply...
551 2018-06-05 18:31:56 Has your advisor been telling you for years to avoid tech?  Same advisor have you loaded up in "safe" consumer stocks?  Same advisor justifying years of underperformance although still charging that big fat fee?

Fire them.
552 2018-06-05 18:31:37 Fun fact, $FAT isn't the only Lithium stock to take a huge tumble, FAT fell 80% from high, $AAZ fell 81% from high, $REZ -76%, $LIT -75%, $QMC -72%, $LEXI -69% $NMX 60%, $LAC 57%. Lithium stocks got hit hard, with juniors getting hit the hardest but they will recover!
553 2018-06-05 18:31:11 I really liked your interview on the UN report that the US is getting poorer and how. Ppl are confused with unemployment rate low and stocks high = wealthier economy. It’s not! More jobs at lower wages & stocks is a value of company not economy.

560 2018-06-05 18:28:18 Ban bump stocks!
561 2018-06-05 18:28:08 Bump stocks are for killing humans quickly. They have NO OTHER PURPOSE. Ban them!!!
562 2018-06-05 18:28:00 It is this admin that has made us laughing stocks. These students have the brains and courage to lead the changes desperately needed in America. They have more of a clue than you unless you have seen your friends die beside you as most of our vets have.
563 2018-06-05 18:27:30 My guess would be lower than in the past (who knows what that level is was) but I don't get the sense they take many risks when it comes to food and grain stocks.
564 2018-06-05 18:26:45 But the important thing is when will you ban bump stocks like you promised? Are you afraid of the @NRA
565 2018-06-05 18:26:34 RT @PaulWallace123: #SouthAfrica's #rand, bonds and stocks tumble after the economy suffered its worst performance in nine years #Ramaphosa
566 2018-06-05 18:25:24 Oh, been there, done that to.  You can generally recover if a decent company.
I haven't been in to many OTC stocks, but I was in the legendary PHOT halt. I sold 1/2 before halt for nice gains....but the day of was in process to sell the rest, then i got screwed.

Besides, I couldn't care less if you do.

574 2018-06-05 18:17:26 In most cases, Institutional investors buy when others are fear full if they are convinced about the company and only when stocks hit bottom. As a Company DPW has good growth ahead. So you use your judgement.

586 2018-06-05 18:09:25 Great! I’m not a student, but I am a constituent. Ban bump stocks, universal background checks, raise the minimum age to 21 to buy a firearm, decrease magazine ammunition size, and ban the sale of weapons of war, such as an assault  rifles.
587 2018-06-05 18:09:06 How are these stocks going to be sold? Is a stock exchange on its way?
588 2018-06-05 18:08:45 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
589 2018-06-05 18:07:57 The dollar, short the $USD $DXY. Either straight up vs. another #FX, or by being long US Dollar denominated #commodities, #stocks, maybe even select #crypto.
590 2018-06-05 18:07:56 ...more stocks than just those in the portfolio, however, we have to be conscious how many names we hold at any given time and the weighting in any one sector or industry. Hope that helps in understanding some of the divergence between MM and AAP. While the opinions are ALWAYS...
591 2018-06-05 18:07:50 Stocks mixed this point in the day. TREND IS NOW UP, NO HEDGES. Risk on for the moment. Enjoy the ride!

593 2018-06-05 18:06:59 $KSU is among the transportation #stocks that are weaker in a choppy market today, BUT this one is different. Kansas City Southern gleans 47% of sales from customers in #Mexico. Despite #NAFTA rhetoric, #TradeWars blooming, etc. there is still no technical breakdown.
594 2018-06-05 18:06:59 Good Q, while there are several factors that go into the decision to initiate, the biggest thing to keep in mind (in my view) is that the difference b/w MM and AAP is on MM, opinions are given on individual stocks, without as much consideration for other portfolio holding...
595 2018-06-05 18:06:39 School safety IS banning automatic rifles, bump stocks, raising the age limit, longer profiling!
596 2018-06-05 18:06:27 @scrowder What do you think about television shows pushing heavy political opinions? I am a fan of all the CW DC tv shows and this latest episode of supergirl was ridiculous. The name for the episode should have been called “Gun Control: Bump stocks and disarming the Police”
597 2018-06-05 18:05:44 THOROUGH background checks so that mentally ill people cannot buy guns. Period. Raise purchase age to 21 nationwide. Ban bump stocks... the current restrictions are not working are they?
598 2018-06-05 18:05:29 Because bump fire stocks are just a teqnique and you don’t need the stock to do it the stock just makes it easier

606 2018-06-05 18:00:10 Really?
"U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars" WRONG. That's increased value of stocks, not GDP. Your base own stock?

"best economy in history of country." WRONG. See 1950s, 60s, 90s, 09-16

"Record Jobs" WRONG. Your 16mo < Obama's last 16mo.

617 2018-06-05 17:56:02 Honestly I am not 100% understanding it either but it looks like stocks are being affected today by index roll date.

635 2018-06-05 17:46:13 The problem with what you're saying is that a good portion of the community myself included do NOT think it is a good pace. Sm4sh imo is a pretty slow paced game but 2 stocks and rage give the illusion it's not that bad, but there's major flaws with both of those things.

644 2018-06-05 17:43:09 About half of Nifty 50 is Financials.  A few years back, this was Infra, I think.  Will Nifty 50 be such a good indicator... unless you own Nifty 50 stocks in similar proportion (in which case it is quasi-indexing and a different discussion).

665 2018-06-05 17:37:28 My thing’s not even about investing, it’s about the perception of mentors by their students. I’ve gotten more positive than negative out of writing about companies/stocks, but I now know better how to keep a balance of what I publicly reveal to not get into commitment bias.
666 2018-06-05 17:37:22 I'm fine with 2 stocks because a 2 stock game is equivalent to 2 out of 3 rounds in Street Fighter. I do like the pacing of a 3 stock/4 stock game more, though.

681 2018-06-05 17:31:09 Germany stocks were higher after the close on Tuesday, as gains in the Technology, Software and Consumer & Cyclical sectors led shares higher.

At the close in Frankfurt, the DAX gained 0.13%, while the MDAX index added 0.18%, and the

684 2018-06-05 17:29:51 There are those beautiful Christian values. 1st of all, welfare usage skyrocketed as a result of the recession. It was decreased dramatically post the recession, but gradually. Just like how stocks increased gradually, and unemployment decreased gradually.

756 2018-06-05 17:04:37 Bump stocks have been pretty much banned and raising the age to 21 wouldn't do a damn thing but impead on ppl 18 & overs rights it's no benefit to do so

790 2018-06-05 16:51:34 Oprah once said that she buys stocks based upon belief in the product & the company's leadership. $TWTR is a great platform even as it faces challenges ahead. @jack is a great CEO although he keeps investors, like us, a little anxious. $TWTR is a solid bet.

819 2018-06-05 16:35:49 Stock selection is very important because some stocks are experiencing major break downs. Most recent example is Carnival Cruise (CCL - 60.71) - it made another lower low and completed a major top. A downside target to the low-to-mid 50s is readable.

921 2018-06-05 15:52:55 Market II: As #Nasdaq cools off following a new record high, #transportation #stocks cool off even more. Dow transports down nearly 1.1% on weak #airline, #truck, #railroad issues; -1.8%, -1.1%, -0.9%, respectively. #WTI #crude #oil edges up 0.4% to $65/brl @MarketSmith $DJT
922 2018-06-05 15:52:23 11.2% sorry not 11.9%
923 2018-06-05 15:52:11 Wouldn't Midcap stocks which had amazing results and are beaten down give a higher % or returns?
924 2018-06-05 15:52:09 Oh please, you’re pathetic
925 2018-06-05 15:51:37 2/2 Even protection against wild animals, ok. Not sure that’s what it was about myself. But unprovoked mass shootings of innocent people I have a problem with. So yeah. Ban bump stocks.
926 2018-06-05 15:50:51 Dividing your account into equal position sizes and investing it into 6 or 7 stocks is an absolute universe away from what I do. That would be insanity

I went on a buying spree and now I own 23 stocks. That might be too many. But I've decided to try to buy and hold. Maybe I can try to enjoy the summer weather.

941 2018-06-05 15:44:56 Unlike what Barry told you, banning things such as bump stocks is not able to be done by president himself. It's the legislature that makes that decision.

As for the age, in most circumstances, minimum ages are often a state legislature function....
942 2018-06-05 15:44:44 Its not just canopy, its all my MJ stocks. It makes me think a large institutional investor just sold all their shares.
943 2018-06-05 15:44:42 Since there are “thousands on the books” you shouldn’t mind just 1 more.  Banning bump stocks is a bipartisan issue.. you mention saving 1 life... if banning bump stocks prevents 1 person from getting one, and that saves the life of 5 people one day, would it be worth it to you?

966 2018-06-05 15:33:49 People derive more comfort when they book profit and see stocks declining. What's surprising - they are ok with holding loss-making positions. What's worse - they average losers on the way down.

968 2018-06-05 15:33:16 Long/short is a well established way to run a portfolio. On a way down the issue could be receiving a false signal that it's a 'way down', when say market dips 15% and goes back up. Value shorts could be the expensive + high momentum stocks that can continue to soar =  not good.
969 2018-06-05 15:33:10 The big pain is not that #Stocks are falling. The biggest pain is stocks are falling when all #global #markets are up/ #INR stable/ #CrudeOil is almost settled from last 2 weeks./ #Monsoon is on time.

973 2018-06-05 15:31:45 Most investors are overconfident too so if you think that your ideal would be 5-6 stocks you should really be holding 9-10. Best to err on the side of greater diversification not less. For most non-quant strategies holding more than about 50-60 stocks is unlikely to add value tho

980 2018-06-05 15:28:58 Bump stocks on semi-automatic guns correlate to lethality like ribs on condoms correlate to stopping sperm. It's a fallacy in the minds of both those who want to buy them & those who want to ban them. They may both be fun to "use" but are moot in regards to outcome of your "shot"
981 2018-06-05 15:26:24 Thevoux-Chabuel, who is based in France, says Comgest's "growth approach" focuses on long-term performance, holds stocks for average of 3-5+ years and uses integrated #ESG analysis. Half of assets are in emerging markets. #RIACon18
982 2018-06-05 15:25:34 Midcap and small cap stocks in India don't have enough liquidity in times of stress. This means that they are volatile and can burn investors. Following individuals whose portfolio is measured in 100s of millions of rupees may not be ideal for someone with 10 lac.
983 2018-06-05 15:25:10 keep selling rallies in stocks - XLF looks vulnerable to at least 10% more downside on a close below 26.75 area
984 2018-06-05 15:25:09 Banning bump stocks would clearly be within presidential power, carrying out laws currently existing.
985 2018-06-05 15:24:45 When you show stocks don't always do well over all long periods of time, the argument switches to: "But people are dollar cost averaging, not investing lump sums at tops, so who cares?"

No. Retirees aren't dollar cost averaging anymore.

996 2018-06-05 15:21:18 #EPS #Interpretation 
Standalone EPS may not be as effective.
But historical EPS gives insights into the company.
For investors, EPS is more important than PAT. Why?
PAT gives only a feel about the company.
PAT does not directly effect the market price of stocks.

1048 2018-06-05 15:00:24 I dont think they blame individual gun owners . I have not seen that in anything they've said. Yes, they are against the NRA as an organization because they want change. I saw the result of bump stocks...gotta say...they can go. Back ground checks, I'm ok with that too.
1049 2018-06-05 15:00:00 BEARISH for stocks
1050 2018-06-05 14:59:14 LMAO you permabulls crack me up....we are in the 9th innings for stocks, the last bastion of FOMO is high beta (tech, small caps etc)....when the dominoes start to fall these are exactly the WRONG places to be...sell rallies!!!
1051 2018-06-05 14:58:41 Love stocks. Was Late joining the stock game but dang it’s nice making money on days off
1052 2018-06-05 14:58:34 Would be perfect if u add lower priced stocks, under 20$ if possible :)
1053 2018-06-05 14:57:42 @jimcramer Jim, any concern that outside of the top 6 stocks on the NDX, everything else is very mediocre?
1054 2018-06-05 14:57:10 a few wall street darlings do well however many, many other smaller but very successful stocks with better than expected earnings and forecasts get trashed regularly for no reason. Wall street fund managers and their hierarchy scamming investors and IRAs
1055 2018-06-05 14:56:51 Why relate it with all nifty when nifty 50 large cap index is decided by only certain stocks.... Isn't this wrong comparison with overall stocks listed on nse?
1056 2018-06-05 14:56:17 The biggest mistake in stocks for me will be not buying Netflix in 2016. Gut feeling over fundamentals is bad thing! 
1057 2018-06-05 14:56:01 After #Demonetisation the entire Fintwit verse was bearish on stocks and broader equity markets and not one person asked or suggested you to buy while strong hands continued to buy. What makes you think they will when markets are correcting now?

1059 2018-06-05 14:55:40 $ddd for whatever reason I think this is about to run.  Broke out few weeks back and then went down to $12, but now has taken out that high.  3D printing was once hot and fell out of favor, but with the transportation bottlenecks I love these stocks.  $ssys $vjet
1060 2018-06-05 14:55:32 Yes, but the tricky thing is that today's short term was yesterday's long term. A better interpretation is that sometimes the market prices stocks incorrectly, but that price and value ultimately converge in the future.
1061 2018-06-05 14:55:25 (WWR).-Our reserve stocks hv fallen below 10 day of intense fighting if war were 2 take place tomm. But none in PMO or of Def min hv bothered as 2 how 2 equip Armed Forces 2 fight a battle if it is forced on us. We r back to 1962 as far as defence preparedness goes.

1065 2018-06-05 14:53:56 .... like Margot with the chance of a platoon. The factor existed he would have more down side risk than some w/o platoon issues with the same projection. 

From some stock pricing reading, every stock has it's own upside and downside risk. These get compared to other stocks...
1066 2018-06-05 14:53:46 Ban bump stocks, assault weapons, raise age to purchase guns to 21, lock up weapons so kids don't have access to them, hold parents accountable, universal background checks...(I could do this all day.)

1070 2018-06-05 14:52:13 Not the best meme to use in this instance given Trump’s support for “beefing up” background checks and bump stocks. Just sayin’. 

Choo, choo. Get this awesome train rolling.
1071 2018-06-05 14:51:59 One might think that Warren Buffett buying 140 million shares of Apple would dispel the notion that value investing as an analytical style is about buying "cheap stocks." Quality is a key part of value and may not be reflected in current price creating a bargain/margin of safety.
1072 2018-06-05 14:51:12 A well-intentioned advice. Buy @Microsoft Stocks. They`ll probably develope their own Blockchain. They own the code of all existing Projects and are able to develope a better if not the best one on the market.

1074 2018-06-05 14:50:05 FnO Indices and Stocks are in a very confused state after t last rally in the new Expiry Month. Best strategy is just sit calmly Nd wait for it to settle. If nobody is entering exit in narrow margin profits. Don't be greedy nd too impulsive to trade.

1080 2018-06-05 14:48:41 Yeah man, i stopped lookin at penny stocks a while back. Ive been trading options on these large cap companies, its less capital intensive and the gains are nice since them stocks move in points instead of 20-40 cents lol
1081 2018-06-05 14:48:29 Honestly, watching all these china tech stocks explodes reminds me of the crypto explosion late last year ...  you could have thrown darts and made 1000%
1082 2018-06-05 14:47:22 From 6/5/17 forecast Archive SOXX - There was quite a number of seller announcements this morning in the chip stocks, so it's not a surprise it could not advance.  From here we're just going to see whether there's enough demand to soak up this additional supply or not.
1083 2018-06-05 14:47:15 Jealous? Of what? One more Series win? The A’s had pedigree. Now they’re laughing stocks, feeder franchise to the league. Name the last A to start and finish with the team? Or sign with them by choice and not necessity? Even Reggie Jackson is wearing a NYY hat in the HOF.
1084 2018-06-05 14:46:32 Funny Chris, I was at my parents this weekend with my perma-bear brother and had to hear all of them say - the economy is doing terrible, stocks are up based on nothing and, if you were smart, you’d be in all cash.   I kid you not.  This is the post 2000, 2007 mindset
1085 2018-06-05 14:46:08 Stock market != economic value, DOTARD!!

Also, only rich people own stocks, so maybe try to do something for everyone?

1106 2018-06-05 14:39:58 Too much 6 month analysis . Buy quality stocks stocks with good trends. Enough “ momo” stocks. If I worried about short term cycles would  have sold APPL, V, FB long time ago.

1125 2018-06-05 14:32:36 I don't disagree with any of that, can easily make the argument that we cut end stocks below 2.0.  Only thing that makes me nervous on that are the 2 ish million acres that didn't show up on the March intentions report coming back to corn production the end of the month.

1128 2018-06-05 14:32:09 Why would law enforcement need bump stocks? If they are ued to convert a semi auto to automatic rifle and the law enforcement can already get full auto rifles what is the point. Our law enforcement seems too trigger happy as it is.

1148 2018-06-05 14:26:53 No, it’s 1.2% on all your assets. 

So whether that’s in money on savings account, gold, $Crypto, property, stocks, bonds, etc. doesn’t matter.

You just add up all your assets and calculate the total value on January 1st of the tax year

Over that amount you will pay 1.2%

1175 2018-06-05 14:17:37 Looks like i made a good exit from Dilip buildcon. In initial days of investing when you don't have much cash on hand you do need to take a few risks. Switching between different stocks does help in such cases.

1207 2018-06-05 14:10:13 These kids, this movement is NOT about taking away your 2a rights. YOU need to educate yourself on the movement.  It’s about banning automatic/semi automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, adding deeper background and mental health checks.

1210 2018-06-05 14:08:31 Good question.

As a stock is rising, so does its market cap, so over some periods of a *long bull market*, it looks like a closet-MO index :)
1431 2018-06-05 12:51:06 I notice Stocks didn’t make your list....
1432 2018-06-05 12:49:01 Let's start with you and all your horrible things!!!!  Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1433 2018-06-05 12:48:48 I think the low vol phenomenon should persist, given human nature and the desire to find investing short cuts, eg lottery stocks
1434 2018-06-05 12:48:44 Oh people are gonna be able to buy stocks in bighit?? Come through Jin

1436 2018-06-05 12:47:43 @SEBI_India Even a market regulator understands dynamics too late. Decision of recategorisation is timed very disappointingly disastrous for investors who,like small & mid cap stocks, will get wiped with dailyvalue erosion. If mid caps are so bad, don't even allow listing them.
1437 2018-06-05 12:47:03 Sir learnt a lot in this correction.. was thinking 6 months back to retire and just live on stocks.. now I love my job again..ofcourse will not run away... but try to be more judicious
1438 2018-06-05 12:46:51 Just to add, called hsbc direct plus. They do not charge any fx fee for US stocks in an isa which is great. However think their platform is not good, to put mildly..no app, sign in web with secure key, no demo and forums mention various issues...made in early 00 and not changed!
1439 2018-06-05 12:46:32 Beginning stocks looks too high

1445 2018-06-05 12:45:22 There you go again. Stop the whining, stop playing to your base, man up. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1446 2018-06-05 12:45:20 Yay! Oil stocks!!!!

1447 2018-06-05 12:45:13 lol you are flailing. No amount of childish name-calling or blatant lies will save you. You ARE transparent, despite your constant attempts at covering up the facts. Transparency! From *you*?! SHOW US YOUR TAXES. HELP PUERTO RICO. BAN BUMP STOCKS. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpCrimeFamily
1448 2018-06-05 12:44:06 Can we check 2 year high lows? Last year stocks had ripped a lot so trading at 52 wk lows some might still be at pretty lofty levels
1449 2018-06-05 12:43:31 Enough with the whining. Man up, do your job. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1450 2018-06-05 12:43:07 Ang saya ng TWTR. lol Well, tech and semicon stocks in general are interesting ngayon. ^^
1451 2018-06-05 12:43:01 DWA started the SMA of their MO similar to PDP in 2005, the same time I started mine. What I can tell you from experience is that MO applied to stocks showed much more alpha in the bull market pre-2008 than the most recent period. More recently, cap weighting has been similar.

Experts: Modi is for no good. PC was better. We need an economist only as FM.
1457 2018-06-05 12:40:31 Will the stocks correct further from here? There is no correction in nifty till now n if it comes it will further take down the small n midcap with it. Your thoughts please. @BMTheEquityDesk
1458 2018-06-05 12:39:42 Bonds tend to rise contrast to the Stock Market or Dow Jones Industrial Average. Take age subtract from 100, and that’s your mix of Stocks and Bonds. 20yrs old? 100-20 = 80% Stocks 20% Bonds (I first the DJIA continuing its momentum of rising)

1461 2018-06-05 12:38:35 I guess we will see. Imo if gold ever becomes the shiny new bull market like stocks and crypto were, funds will find a reason to get in. The $1900 run was an attempt at a bull market. It was just starting to get traction before it collapsed

What will happen when it will fall more than 30%

1464 2018-06-05 12:37:59 1. Apparently you're talking about stock market capitalization.

2. The stock market is not the same as the economy.

3. One-third of US stocks are owned by foreigners.

4. The Dow has dropped nearly 2,000 points since January 26.

5. The market grew at a faster rate under Obama.

1466 2018-06-05 12:37:43 The seemingly-never-ending rally in U.S. Stocks in 2017 came to a halt in January due in part to fears of rising inflation and interest rate
1467 2018-06-05 12:37:29 "If we were to include both large- and mid-cap [Chinese] stocks, half of the companies covered by the MSCI EM Index would come from China." - MSCI CEO Henry Fernandez
1468 2018-06-05 12:37:19 Agreed, what specifically are they resisting?
1469 2018-06-05 12:36:09 Owning shares/stocks/equity basically helps share losses.

But that's obviously "evil capitalism".

Gambling is also "evil exploitative capitalism" whenever the gambler wins.

1474 2018-06-05 12:34:55 Looks like there's been quite a downturn in oil-related stocks in the last week or so
1475 2018-06-05 12:34:36 I can dig it,
I made killing off Chinese stocks so far this year for swing trades
1476 2018-06-05 12:33:57 If you have a good weighted average production estimate then risk is always good.  It is more like owning an option than a stock. With an option the value goes up with a volatile underlying stock where as a stocks value is reduced with increased volatility.
1477 2018-06-05 12:33:27 Exactly! I really don't think it's backed by anything other than computer code that digitizes real money and siphons further money from crypto transactions, but I'm not sure. I agree with you about it being a bubble!

At least with stocks, bonds, etc. you own something.

1479 2018-06-05 12:32:53 The trouble with fixed income is that there really aren't any reliable or even possible indexes since most bonds are not listed, they mature and disappear completely, and are so numerous. It is impossible to truly create a bond index fund the way we can with stocks.

1523 2018-06-05 12:10:02 This is very disturbing.  My Democratic ballot had questions about prohibiting bump stocks, Medicaid expansion, stopping partisan gerrymandering, and tax $'s for Mass transit.  What's wrong with @GaRepublicans?

1536 2018-06-05 12:04:34 Because banning bump stocks is like banning box cutters.  Think about it, I know it's hard.

1554 2018-06-05 11:56:58 Most of that is in stocks, Donald, which means that "value" is on paper, rather than in real goods and services, which means it can vanish just as quickly as it appeared.

Man, you'd think a billionaire would have a better grasp of economics than you.

1560 2018-06-05 11:54:29 Trading US "assets" such as via ETF or Investment Trust is not a problem. But direct US stocks is more challenging due to initial FX cost. I've thought about $ based IB account but never done it. Have used IG (they take currency risk) but spreads awful. Anyone figured it out ?

1569 2018-06-05 11:51:49 In the 1990's Sam Walton paid his assiciates $10.00/hr today they make on average $11.00. Don't get me started on Walmart. According to the BLS, and even GOP, report wages are stagnant. There are fewer and fewer middle Americans who can save for retirement or invest in stocks.
1570 2018-06-05 11:50:45 gonna go to my secret site to find some high quality stocks for inspiration on a new project

1576 2018-06-05 11:46:56 Good information - looking into it. I heard VanGuard bought into 3 MJ stocks last quarter, so it looks like the inevitable is happening before our eyes.
1577 2018-06-05 11:46:24 Shorting the strongest stocks is rarely a recipe for success.  Short losers, not winners.
1578 2018-06-05 11:46:14 Shorts are now scrambling. O/S and Market Cap are very low for current revenue numbers of ~$360M a year!

1583 2018-06-05 11:42:37 Oh he definitely manipulates it and his advanced notices he can sell before certain stock takes a hit? That why he makes up those theories about businesses and then watches the stocks go crazy! He’s getting richer scamming as president! Thinks we are stupid too!
1584 2018-06-05 11:41:17 So much money wasted on trips to Mar-a-lago!

1597 2018-06-05 11:37:23 Said this before, I will say it again. The congress must give him the bill for it to become law. He can’t just say that bump stocks are illegal just because he wanted to. Our country doesn’t work that way.

1599 2018-06-05 11:37:21 Why did Obama make bump stocks legal?
1600 2018-06-05 11:36:16 1) the stock market(not economy) has grown by $6.9 tril. Your $0.1tril rounding error is a $100bil.  2) you gutted wall st oversight and gave them money to buy back stock,driving up demand, raising the prices of stocks.
1601 2018-06-05 11:35:58 Some people will not put ANY money in stocks

1603 2018-06-05 11:35:39 Impact of this is done for now.... July and Jan twice a year however some stocks will go to the moon and some to the gutter depending on their relative to 250 rank!
1604 2018-06-05 11:35:19 Republicans think increase in their stocks is the “economy”. They steal from the poor, give to the rich & blow up the economy for working folks. Democrats have to come in & clean up their mess. Every. Single. Time. This time will be harder because dollar value is sinking fast.

1608 2018-06-05 11:33:00 Any thing which goes up irrationally will come down same is true to even stocks. Markets will  never be predictable and the so called analysts who had projected multibagger returns in mid and small cap had forgotten that during corrections it will be hard to even come out.
1609 2018-06-05 11:32:37 Stock market downturns are normal and necessary.  It takes out the froth from the system.  Survival of the fittest. The good stocks with great businesses depending upon their valuations will bounce back with equal ferocity.  The duds will stay where they are now or even go down.

1649 2018-06-05 11:07:58 What is taking so long for you to turn over your tax returns, ban bump- stocks, and make legal age for gun ownership 21? TRANSPARENCY, the public has a right to know!

1652 2018-06-05 11:06:56 Funds might have to reduce or concentrate with fewer stocks ,,, so at times of sudden crash... They'll provide individual investors with supply of smaller companies which due to regulations they can't hold it further... (Maybe I am wrong and don't understand the rule clearly)
1653 2018-06-05 11:06:37 Saahil,  we understand your concerns here but there is nothing what we can do for this. We will not be able to fill the orders if we don't have the stocks..
1654 2018-06-05 11:06:06 Yes, the mental breadth of the foward think  is narrow. They could not imagine that in 5 years more than 250 stocks can be of much larger market cap to be called mid or small cap
1655 2018-06-05 11:05:45 ... and what's taking you so long to ban bump stocks and raise purchase gun age to 21 like YOU PROMISED? Are you in cahoots with and/or afraid of the NRA? #NRABloodMoney

1797 2018-06-05 09:43:54 Seems like a good opportunity for markets with little local manufacturing like Mexico to go big on solar. Physical stocks of panels will have to go somewhere, some big discounts coming.
1798 2018-06-05 09:43:23 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1799 2018-06-05 09:42:46 As a conclusion to all of you, Close for Nifty and Bank Nifty is not bad. There are other pockets which have seen heavy selling today but both the indices, bank nifty and Nifty have defended their levels.

1802 2018-06-05 09:41:35 If you have a p/f of high value (say £1M) and concentrate on 6 small stocks then that's approx £170k in each. Need supreme confidence to do that as knockbacks really hurt, hence most large portfolios will be more diversified.

1820 2018-06-05 09:29:57 These things are common, I was alive when such things happened - in 2000, in 2008, in 2013 (mildly) & now in 2018. I have learnt to look at the big picture. Time is the only important variable and I have it. So, I will wait out this 'clearance sale' & then get into new stocks.
1821 2018-06-05 09:29:13 Yeah I would be a bit concerned that small Stocks might not have the Longevity - perhaps a few FTSE250 would help.
1822 2018-06-05 09:28:11 Blood types ‘AB-positive' and 'AB-negative' are the rarer types and blood bank stocks are low? Time will tell if my guess is right

1922 2018-06-05 08:18:05 Just listened, great podcast as always. As a long term FI trader (2+ years) but a novice standard investor I may misunderstand order books. For regular stocks and shares they work because there are a fixed number of shares. But on FI can’t more shares of a player be issued 1/2

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of moneys collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments and other assets.

1958 2018-06-05 07:50:02 not to labour the point but if a child should know the president could never ban bump stocks or do anything about the age, then the pres should have known not to promise that result as he didn’t have the power, but you keep blaming the child, trump to scared to own his ignorance?
1959 2018-06-05 07:49:23 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

1960 2018-06-05 07:47:32 iOS 12 on iPad is pretty nice so far although a couple of my App folders get nuked during the upgrade, and having deleted the Stocks app, voice memos (at last) is wobbling away merrily even though I’ve cancelled the delete action :)
1961 2018-06-05 07:47:26 The crowd went wild when they announced that News and Stocks will be available on iPads. How does that even warrant an announcement at the biggest annual developer centric event of a company like Apple! They then spent literally 10 minutes on Memoji.

1986 2018-06-05 07:29:41 Experts are making desperate attempt to lure novice investors to invest in current market. I would urge investors to stay on sidelines and wait for 9000 lvls in Nifty to start buying for long-term slowly. After a run-up the stocks need some breather. Conso may go on for 3 yrs

2004 2018-06-05 07:13:13 1/True, but imagine GiTHub would have made an ICO. It would have easily raised more than EOS.

2053 2018-06-05 06:41:48 Best investment advice I got from my appa: invest in stocks in SIPs,have diversified pf,invest in drops in all. You might not have best returns but your pf won't blowup & your investment won't get locked.

When I hear ppl saying capital down 30-40-50-60% etc,feel painful.
2054 2018-06-05 06:41:29 @ArihantCapital  Our company has lost 2/3 market cap from peak valuations in last few months and so have some peers too. Why is the commodity/ brokers stocks going through more pain than other small/ Mid caps ?

2074 2018-06-05 06:29:26 #WWDC18 was disappointing. „a big update to the stocks app“ - I almost jumped out of my seat in anticipation of $crypto tracking. Turned out it’s business news, FML.

2075 2018-06-05 06:29:23 Key word in that tweet is anecdotally.  I take it you weren’t in the industry 10-20 years ago? If you were you had your head in the sand if you think it was better then.

2078 2018-06-05 06:26:19 #Asian stocks struggled for traction Tuesday after pacing a global rally as #investors set aside protectionist fears in favor of optimism over the #US economy! 10y #Treasuries edged higher after a 4th consecutive session of declines.
2079 2018-06-05 06:25:22 Are we kids memoji wtf? Stocks after hours prices hmm that's new..not!
2080 2018-06-05 06:23:18 Investors have panicked and are dumping good stocks as ASM is new. ASM  is only to avoid speculation( 100% Margin & 5%ciruit). In future it will be regular like T2T.
2081 2018-06-05 06:22:08 Looking forward to tangling with the Soviet Union's Ministry of Fisheries archive at the State Archive of the Russian Federation today, looking for Soviet research on Pacific fishing infrastructure/stocks in the 60s/70s...any tips on catalogue/process most welcome #NorthKorea
2082 2018-06-05 06:21:26 Does it tell you when their stocks drop in insider trading time, or investor time?

2085 2018-06-05 06:18:51 Local shares have been unable to maintain recent positive momentum as the #ASX 200 falls 30pts or 0.5% to 5995. Resources stocks the main weight #ausbiz
2086 2018-06-05 06:18:50 The News and Stocks apps have a high degree of visual candy to them, but they don’t feel particularly unMaclike to me.
2087 2018-06-05 06:16:23 Real GDP growth deeply negative. Negative 7% for 2017. Actual unemployment rate 26%. record wealth divide. Record homeless. Stocks are 4-8X overpriced. Look at the Russell 2000 with a PE in excess of 100!

fake economy, fake stock market, fake jobs reports continue. Con man!
2088 2018-06-05 06:15:46 That’s weird. Why last time? What if they don’t exhaust their stocks ?
2089 2018-06-05 06:15:03 I agree partially. If the passive fund track something that's obligated to have CSG then you're kinda disadvantaged. AB Inbev has some challenges in share price context, Top40 has to include it. If you singly select stocks you can avoid it but in funds it's a bit impossible.

2158 2018-06-05 05:37:55 Overall Market View

BSE Smallcap Index is standing at strong monthly support

Capitulation in smallcaps should slow down and quality stocks might find strong buyers . 

Similarly BSE midcap index also standing at strong monthly support

Imagine if this fall accompanies a global crisis, that will create a 2008 like stomach churning fall.

2249 2018-06-05 04:42:27 Relationships are similar to stocks. You find someone you believe and see potential in. You then choose to invest in them. If you invest a small amount, your return will be minimal. If you invest a lot the risk goes up but if you’re patient, and hold, the return can be great.
2250 2018-06-05 04:41:28 You had decades to make guns safer and did exactly the opposite. Tipping point is here.

2262 2018-06-05 04:35:45 People want to ban bump stocks but the bump stock was based off a technique where your finger, if held in place, could use the recoil of the gun to fire without moving your finger. Banning the bump stocks basically does nothing. You can do it without one. It’s called bumpfiring.

2290 2018-06-05 04:17:20 No each step doesn’t help. Some steps are nonsense that will contribute exactly nothing to decreasing the problem, like banning bump stocks.

2298 2018-06-05 04:12:45 What happened in Las Vegas is indeed shameful. He had an assortment of weapons in his room, 14 had bump stocks on them. He had installed cameras in his hall. If that hotel had metal detectors and armed guards, it never would've happened.

2300 2018-06-05 04:11:00 But don’t forget that small caps are at an all-time high as well. It’s large value stocks that are weak.

2302 2018-06-05 04:10:07 I don’t care what the majority believes. I am literally the dictionary definition of a firearms expert. Bump Stocks are a gimmick of the highest order and they aren’t even required to get a gun to bump-fire. The majority is stupid on these matters because they don’t know enough.

2305 2018-06-05 04:09:48 Would like to ask because I’ve seen a stock not tagged SSR right at the open though it was down 10% from prev close. I’m still literally “paper” trading and lack the experience of knowing whether these kinds of stocks get SSRed at the open. Thank you!
2306 2018-06-05 04:09:48 Agree.. Midcaps and small trading at 9000 nifty levels almost. If rbi raises rates tom, a kneejerk fall would be ideal to store up on good stocks.
2307 2018-06-05 04:09:41 Oil weak, Rupee strong. GDP number stronger..stocks down sentiment even more down..perfect time to buy?
2308 2018-06-05 04:09:29 $FANG (and I don’t mean the top tech stocks) finding resistance. If it drops below, a suggested short. On the upside if it recaptures the 200 MA it might have form set-up a entry.
2309 2018-06-05 04:09:09 When someone buys stocks they practically own part of a company...how much depends on how much they purchase. People that own stocks of a company can claim part of the companies assets and earnings

2325 2018-06-05 04:03:08 The majority may not get it right. Instead of securing the schools now they are concerned with banning clown shoes like bump stocks which aren’t even necessary to bump-fire a gun.

2329 2018-06-05 03:58:29 What I wanna know is why they felt the need to port Stocks to iPad and not the fucking Calculator. Nobody gives a damn about Stocks.
2330 2018-06-05 03:58:17 A Frenchman named Max Herve-George, has an insurance policy that lets him trade stocks based on last week's prices. It's been called the stupidest contract ever signed and may end up with him owning the insurance company.
2331 2018-06-05 03:57:02 #Crypto isnt back by anything, It is basically based on sentiment which is what TA attempts to read. Ive done a fair bit of crypto privately and yes TA in crypto is more compliant than stocks, its just a pain to setup and manage though.
2332 2018-06-05 03:56:56 What do we do with the stocks of old used polythene bags which we keep reusing time and again to avoid fresh polythene bags usage for vegetables and groceries?
2333 2018-06-05 03:56:42 @Apple *Gives us Stocks on iPad*

2334 2018-06-05 03:56:29 I don’t talk about this stock enough but $BZUN really is one of my favorite stocks. I haven’t played it in a minute because I’ve been focused on other ones and I honestly don’t like watching too many stocks at the same time. But it’s an awesome stock to play with
2335 2018-06-05 03:56:06 Is there a time frame till when the stocks remain in ASM ? HEG & Graphite India really hurting investors.

2337 2018-06-05 03:55:34 Yeah I’ve got a majority of my money ($55k+) in stocks and traditional investments. And ($15-20k) invested in crypto (BTC, ETH, ZRX, ZEC, MSP) currently sitting at -10% for whole portfolio.
2338 2018-06-05 03:54:15 Because banning bump stocks is silly when a rubber band easily replaces it. Raising the legal age to 21 is a slippery slope when one can sign up for the military at 18 and he said he'd leave gun legislation up to the governments of individual states, as it should be.
2339 2018-06-05 03:53:02 Hi Elio any chance we could hear your thoughts on $ECX? I remember this was one of your star stocks but have not heard you talk about it recently on tv or here since they reported?
2340 2018-06-05 03:52:54 Considering the fact that I plan to buy from H&B when the stocks return, I'll have no bail money to trust to you, anyway. And if I were in a jail cell with Scott Patrick Moir, I'd never want to post bail anyway. There, I said it.

If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temp & when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. 

Good Stocks do the same.

2406 2018-06-05 03:18:12 if that happens I bet many other stocks are eating it hard as well
2407 2018-06-05 03:17:41 I wonder if, ironically, lots of DP’s & Director’s obsession with the “film look” kinda drives it. Last few years seen lots of “drop a washed-out film emulation LUT on the final edit and call it ‘filmic’”, unaware there used to be tons of film stocks for tons of different looks!

RIL: I like structure and like yesterday, saying again, buy on every dip. Bottom has been made. Moving higher towards 980 levels 

Tata Motors: Stellar JLR US numbers, 294 is a resistance, any move there is profit booking area.

2412 2018-06-05 03:15:52 Common sense gun laws are no threat to the 2nd amendment or hunters, ban bump stocks, universal background checks, no fly-no gun!
2413 2018-06-05 03:15:37 Let’s unravel the steel and aluminum tariffs. Is it being done to bolster metal stocks? Whose idea was it? Both metals figure large in building construction. Are kickbacks involved as a pay-off? What other mischief is afoot?
2414 2018-06-05 03:15:21 I just downloaded historical data from Google for all S&P 500 stocks over the weekend but found the quality to be awful. I ended up getting it from Alpha Vantage. Their quality is much better.
2415 2018-06-05 03:15:09 Don't get disheartened by the carnage happening in the S&M-Cap stocks lately. Instead, utilize this opportunity to understand what really went wrong during the selection process.

Believe me, investing is a wonderful exercise if done with due diligence.
Don't quit.
2416 2018-06-05 03:14:53 Ban bump stocks NOW!
2417 2018-06-05 03:14:28 You dont think the adjectives Ouch and Whoops aren’t signalling a negative perception he has on those stocks? He has a long track record of criticism of GXY. He used to put up graphs of AVZ v GXY SP performance. Havent seen those lately.
2418 2018-06-05 03:13:17 Universal background checks, regardless of thier popularity, are unenforcible and are often totally inappropriate. Bump stocks are clown shoes and are not at all needed to bump-fire a gun. I learned to bump-fire when I was 12 with only my finger.

2433 2018-06-05 03:07:20 Anti Retail & Small Investor Stocks including those with stellar past performance are unlikely to sustain growth in financial markets based on proven evidence based Governance Expectations of modern connected world. Diversification is the unwritten law.

2460 2018-06-05 02:55:03 Ban bump stocks!
2461 2018-06-05 02:53:59 Don't have anything I especially like now, but I always keep a list of 20 (or so stocks) that I closely watch. I am simple. Usually it's companies I use, think are doing a good job and companies that will grow and be around  long time.
2462 2018-06-05 02:53:36 name one or two stocks which corrected badly in recent times, for investment...
2463 2018-06-05 02:53:03 I think more pain in Frontline stocks Mid cap and small cap is awaiting.Macro is getting weak.though Micros are improving.

2467 2018-06-05 02:50:47 With you on that sir, a bit of course correction is a must. Also the weaker hands have been shaken out and on top of all the exchanges, in their wisdom, cracking when the stocks had fallen steeply providing further impetus to fall. We're asleep or indifferent until now???
2468 2018-06-05 02:50:43 And if you think I’m full of it. Watch MU stock over the next week. 64-68 move. “Bitcoin for the cool generation, stocks are for old boring people” Crystal. That’s just ignorance. Trading stocks & options you can flip 10k over night with 100k if u know on what you’re doing

2536 2018-06-05 02:17:45 Thanks to President Obama for leaving the country in such good shape. He was respected by the world.

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

The world is laughing.

2546 2018-06-05 02:12:59 Hey @realDonaldTrump “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

All is well when BTs is performing profitably. Nothing guarantees if they don’t. Same for all investors btw
2552 2018-06-05 02:11:36 This is called a conversation. People have them in the real world. I’m sorry if you’ve been offended. How about China’s reduction on solar subsidies crushing stocks such as CSIQ today.
2553 2018-06-05 02:11:29 No trades for me today as I didn’t see any setups that were clearly predictable. Plus a day with no trade isn’t a negative thing. It just shows that my discipline is is growing  #traders @DekmarTrades #trader #stocks

2558 2018-06-05 02:10:53 yeah, and it’s not even nice. like we actually do things, like taxes. i can do my own taxes and i know how to do stocks:) i only signed up for that class because i thought it wouldn’t make me want to throw myself out the window. but it does

2560 2018-06-05 02:09:39 This year #googleio2018 gave us an ai that could navigate difficult speech with a human to get you a haircut and table reservation over the phone. To counter, this year Apple gave us a side bar in the news app and stocks apps with an unreasonable amount of gusto #WWDC2018
2561 2018-06-05 02:09:13 And you need to look a little wider and longer down the road. 83% of Our tax breaks went to 1% of Americans, some trickled down , but most bought stocks. We backed out of agreements with our best allies, including for a cleaner environment. Lastly, only temporary economy boosts.
2562 2018-06-05 02:08:53 Never defend the swamp!! They need to go! McConnell, Ryan, Graham and so many.  Bump stocks were the lesser evil to appease libs.

2604 2018-06-05 01:46:40 Bang pd himself has more than 50% of the stocks and his brother has 25% so basically he still has the power to control the company. Going public with that only for good not bad things.
2605 2018-06-05 01:44:27 Today I checked out a few BSE stocks for the first time. As a regular #crypto trader it's unsettling how you people have patience to trade stocks on a margin of +/- ₹5.

2637 2018-06-05 01:21:16 In what ways? We’ve had lower unemployment. Wages only rose 8 cents/ hr. 1st quarter in spite of record corporate profits.

2650 2018-06-05 01:16:25 The comments below reference Bang PD’s cousin having a majority ownership in the stocks. So really, it’s still under their control.
2651 2018-06-05 01:14:51 Are you trying to type that bump stocks are illegal?

Because they're not.
2652 2018-06-05 01:14:14 Why ban? Can use a rubber band to do same thing. Bump stocks are not a threat.
2653 2018-06-05 01:13:37 A stagnant price over the same time as stocks being up 100% will do that.

2655 2018-06-05 01:12:37 He made his wealthy friends more wealthy as he stated at Marlargo ergo they bought stocks and threw a small bone to employees. That is all Trump did.

2659 2018-06-05 01:11:23 Bang PD owning the majority of the stocks does not mean they are not under the performance pressure for others. Every person buying their shares wants a positive finiancial return. This is stacking more burdens on BTS’s shoulders since they are the only active group BH has.

2666 2018-06-05 01:05:56 Shit what’s being going on with economy gdp employment stocks military .. shows he’s got a brain and ur takin a L for not knowing shit
2667 2018-06-05 01:05:43 Who cares!! Their stocks are going through the roof!! Oh wait! They wasted it on blow and cheap dime store hookers.
2668 2018-06-05 01:04:38 Can BTS just buy some stocks? Sorry if the question sounds stupid.
2669 2018-06-05 01:04:27 1. Unemployment was going down since Obama's tenure. It doesn't stop and go bc of who is president
2. we've been fighting terrorism for literally 18 years. 
3. Check your data again on stocks
4. Peace talks with NK was because of South Korea + change of NK's foreign policy.
2670 2018-06-05 01:04:22 #tip if somebody really interested in buying IT stocks choose Persistent Systems,Tata Elxi,L&T Tech,Oracle Financials. #investSmartly
2671 2018-06-05 01:04:09 There's also the seldom discussed fact that many (many!!) more stocks have gone to zero than have gone to infinity
2672 2018-06-05 01:03:43 We need to ban all assault weapons and in particular, the bump stocks. I'm so proud of your generation -- you've given us hope again.
2673 2018-06-05 01:03:28 You took over a thriving economy for President Obama which he inherited a terrible economy.  2 years into office he stimulated the economy and it prospered.  Stocks were on the rise and unemployment was shrinking. So let's start with thanking a man with honor. #ObamaLegacy
2674 2018-06-05 01:02:52 European stocks mostly rose on Monday as political concerns in Spain and Italy calmed, and traders’ optimism was boosted by news of potential corporate M&A.
2675 2018-06-05 01:02:46 Retail stocks saw strength as @Target surged 4.9%, @Walmart jumped 2.9%, @HomeDepot advanced 2.1%, @Lowes gained 1.8% and @Nike added 1.5%.
2676 2018-06-05 01:02:27 It depends on how much the money means to an individual. If this is excess income, Growth is ideal considering that stocks are more expensive and risky.
But if this is my lifetime savings, Value markets are the automatic choice
2677 2018-06-05 01:02:21 I've looked into this. Unfortunately, it's very difficult for foreigners to purchase stocks on the Korean exchange. Still, I'm going to try!!
2678 2018-06-05 01:02:17 MAKE BTS BUY STOCKS PLS
2679 2018-06-05 01:02:07 That sucks man, but it is ok. Take a month off from trading stocks. Relax your mind before you trade again. Once you come back, trade with small small until you develop your strategy.
2680 2018-06-05 01:02:02  i see "healthcare" stocks should keep skyrocketing
2681 2018-06-05 01:01:03 Bahaha..... yeah sadly not:p I could buy a Hotwheels car but that's about it  freaking omvs man. Ughh
2682 2018-06-05 01:00:57 US stocks rose on Monday, led by strong gains in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, as traders appeared to shrug off global trade tensions and focused on a favourable economic backdrop instead
2683 2018-06-05 00:59:49 Ok guys who likes gambling ?

Ever thought of trading stocks ?

Its risky and thats kind of the thrill right ?

Ever heard of #BITCOIN ? $btc

Trade bitcoin & crypto $NEO  or just buy some & hold then sell at a later date for profit

2684 2018-06-05 00:59:05 Even if the fans are buying the stocks BTS is not exactly relieved of any pressure. It’s the investment vs return nature of the business. When a big amount of money is paid, people want more in return, not less.
2685 2018-06-05 00:58:30 Can’t wait to use my most used iPhone apps. Voice memos and stocks on the Mac!!
2686 2018-06-05 00:58:04 Se supone que BH no tenía intenciones de ir pública, no entiendo de donde sale está noticia. Espero que Bang PD conserve sus stocks y que los chicos puedan comprar algunos. Me preocupa la presión que pueda causar en ellos y la influencia que pueda tener la Junta en decisiones
2687 2018-06-05 00:57:53 Great stuff with $TWTR joining the S&P! Also, $ROKU and $CRON good stocks to watch for this week.
2688 2018-06-05 00:57:41 Out of all the odd things I've noticed with Wall Street since I've started to play around with stocks, it's how much investors hate GE for cutting a mediocre dividend.
2689 2018-06-05 00:56:52 GDP down to 2.3% 1st quarter 2018, wages up only 8 cents/hour yet corporations got $84 billion in tax cuts & are making record profits. What happened to “trickle-down” economics? Stocks volatile due to possible trade war. Gas prices & interest rates are up. Jobs not only measure.
2690 2018-06-05 00:56:42 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it  with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
2691 2018-06-05 00:56:33 Can BTS themselves buy the stocks and be actively part of the company tho?
2692 2018-06-05 00:55:52 #Sensex Buy safe stocks during this period of volatility like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Reliance Industries, Godrej Consumer Products
2693 2018-06-05 00:55:42 It’s something like 30 stocks that generated most of the stock market wealth past 20 years
2694 2018-06-05 00:55:25 The real agenda is to ban bump stocks. Not sure how you gun nuts keep missing the point of just about every single gun control measure.  You don't need them to bump fire a semi-auto rifle? Okay..then ban semi-auto rifles. No? Okay then ban bumps stocks. Pretty simple really.
2695 2018-06-05 00:55:25 My guess is on lease stock tanks are spilling out of the thief hatches in west Texas. If we included those stocks we would be surplus relative to the 5yr avg and that would go a long way to explaining the the weakness in WTI.
2696 2018-06-05 00:55:18 Para los que preguntan, eso significa que preguntan, esto significa que BH entrará al mercado de valores, por lo que personas podrán comprar stocks de la empresa. Esto da mayor libertad para expandir la empresa, pero también depende de quien compra los stocks quien controla
2697 2018-06-05 00:55:00 Bump stocks are obscene. They are a perversion devised to circumvent the law and must be banned.
The young people will win.
#BanBumpStocks
2698 2018-06-05 00:54:46 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2699 2018-06-05 00:54:26 I have 0 knowledge when it comes to stocks and stuff but it’s fun seeing people talk about it??
2700 2018-06-05 00:54:21 Now we have commercial crude oil declining sharply the past 2 years, but spreads widening. I wonder what that storage data would look like if we included lease stocks again.
2701 2018-06-05 00:54:16 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2702 2018-06-05 00:53:44 You can buy stocks means that you have a kind of "ownership" of the company in proportion of the number of total shares. And they can be exchanged in the limits of law 

I hope I explained it well sorry for mistakes if there are any
2703 2018-06-05 00:53:43 RT SJosephBurns "Historically only 20% of stocks generate all the long term stock market gains. You have to hold the market leaders or get them with an index."
2704 2018-06-05 00:53:30 A few uranium stocks warming up here
buy the best
the shit will follow down the road
2705 2018-06-05 00:52:52 I wouldn’t say it’s difficult to judge which stocks are breaking out. That’s pretty black and white. But it’s definitely hard to pick which ones will make a big move because of the breakout.
2706 2018-06-05 00:52:51 What stocks do you have your eyes on tomorrow?
2707 2018-06-05 00:51:13 Ironically I'll be selling my Honda 420 to buy marijuana stocks ...
2708 2018-06-05 00:51:09 Historically only 20% of stocks generate all the long term stock market gains. You have to hold the market leaders or get them with an index.
2709 2018-06-05 00:50:20 Adult working army you need to get those stocks from IPO
2710 2018-06-05 00:49:55 Sure, ended one of the worse recessions in US history. Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000, biggest bull run in history. Unemployment from double digits to almost 4%. No scandals within his Administration, no nepotism, no questions about violating emoluments clause.
2711 2018-06-05 00:49:03 Electric Vehicles & Allied industries
CRAMS,API
Specialty Chemicals
Cold Storage
AI & IOT

& of course my regular Compounders.

These would be my betting themes for next few years,I have almost narrowed down stocks & started adding them thru SIPs. 

Decided if company is good,
2712 2018-06-05 00:49:02 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
2713 2018-06-05 00:48:32 The only urge that will ruin an investor is the urge to stay in 'stocks' vs stay in 'cash decision. The urge to do something is indeplorable. #InvestingThoughts
2714 2018-06-05 00:47:44 Good to hear!:) I just hope BH knows what theyre doing,
there is still some risk that people will try becoming a major shareholder, they will still have a say in the company.

But damn, they must be rich asf  50 percent! I wonder what the rate of return is on those stocks.
2715 2018-06-05 00:47:36 Update from the road. Today's strength in stocks hit the stops on the rest of the hedges, so now, FINALLY, we have TREND UP, NO HEDGES. Green light for risk at this point. Enjoy the ride everyone!
2716 2018-06-05 00:47:08 They're still mad about stocks going up. I couldn't believe people were this stubborn unless I saw it with my own eyes. And I have. Human behavior is absolutely amazing.
2717 2018-06-05 00:46:43 but what exactly does buying stocks mean/do? (sorry if this is a stupid question i just don’t know)
2718 2018-06-05 00:46:37 From what I’ve read, self medication is at an all time high. 
Imagine that. We are all living in an alternative reality. My advice, buy stocks in liquor companies. Till he’s gone it’s a sure bet. Bigly sad.
2719 2018-06-05 00:46:21 MA10-MA50 Bull Crossover Stocks: $AETI, $CAKE, $GIL, $GLW,$IVR, $KS, $SAVE, $TSS
2720 2018-06-05 00:46:18 I'm sad to hear that. 
I guess the real point is that these guns like AR15s and bump stocks are too easy to get and cause so much grief
2721 2018-06-05 00:45:31 Rewatched my set vs Larry and made WAYYY WAY too many dumb errors and missed grabs that would've taken stocks/games. Also an accidental shield-drop sealed my stock cause I wanted to angle my shield down since I was on a platform and I shield-dropped back onto ledge
2722 2018-06-05 00:45:24 Low-key praying BTS has at least a slice of those stocks... 
2723 2018-06-05 00:44:53 The purpose of stocks isnt to get rich overnight. Its to help grow your money faster than a regular savings account would.
2724 2018-06-05 00:44:18 Ok that calmed me down a bit. I heard some K-Armys are thinking of buying stocks to make sure BTS don't disband or dont sent to the back burner.
2725 2018-06-05 00:44:14 Or maybe Jin's dad company buy all the stocks? So I don't have to worry about them :") @BTS_twt
2726 2018-06-05 00:43:20 There are no 15JUN $IYW calls available above the 186 strike price. IYW closed at 185.50 today. Apparently, options traders are not expecting any upside in tech stocks whatsoever in the next 11 days. Let that sink in. 
2727 2018-06-05 00:43:10 I'm getting grey hair already, more grey hair than I thought. I guess I'll just go out and buy me some stocks and bonds haha amirite.
2728 2018-06-05 00:42:56 my biggest worry is the thing that happened with yg( or maybe sm?) where too many stocks were bought by someone they ended up having so much say in what they do w artists, but i think we need to wait and see what bh do with the terms and conditions hopefully it benefits the boys
2729 2018-06-05 00:42:53 Going public basically means pretty much anyone with enough money can buy Big Hit's stocks.
2730 2018-06-05 00:42:37 I wish I was a millionaire so I could buy and gift them all the stocks :/.
2731 2018-06-05 00:42:37 can bts themselves buy all the stocks if bighit goes public. PLS
2732 2018-06-05 00:42:25 not sure but as far as i remember bangpd and his cousin alone has already more than 50% of the stocks,. and bangpd has the biggest share, so i think, he has the biggest power for decision making,. 

pleaseeeeeee,.

Thanks in advance
2736 2018-06-05 00:41:29 At some level fundamentals seem to matter a lot but that seems more true for large cap stocks. Small caps seem like technology risk plays that are largely based on social proofs because investors aren’t scientist.
2737 2018-06-05 00:41:25 but I mean, get it, day trader? but instead of stocks I trade sex? Because normally
2738 2018-06-05 00:40:45 App updates for iOS all seem great upon second glance: New stocks and news apps are great, Apple Books looks better, and Voice Memos in the cloud was needed.

2739 2018-06-05 00:40:44 Im 16 but imma still try to buy stocks
2740 2018-06-05 00:39:44 Your thanks are appreciated, and I did because I can. As long as internet waifu is happy and has shiny things.... or can afford to buy a new back that doesnt hurt all the time, I dunno if thats a thing that amazon stocks just yet but maybe one day.
2741 2018-06-05 00:39:23 Ban bump stocks? Really? Those gun shots in NV were not from a bump stock modification. Gullible  believe the MSM . Raising the drinking age to 21 really stopped underage drinking eh Einstein? You libtards always go for big gov. Give up freedom for the illusion of security.
2742 2018-06-05 00:39:22 Start investing in sketcher stocks!
2743 2018-06-05 00:39:18 @NCHouseSpeaker rules 7 Dem amendments on school safety bill out of order. Proposals dealt with gun safety regs, such as banning bump stocks and creating "red flag" law. #ncga #ncpol #wral
2744 2018-06-05 00:38:57 i dont think they can buy stocks because they are essentially the product
2745 2018-06-05 00:38:13 yes he is. but an article said bighit might go public which means random people who can, can buy stocks therefore will have a say in the decisions of company. WHICH IS BAD.
2746 2018-06-05 00:38:11 Buying stocks gives people power to make decisions ?
2747 2018-06-05 00:38:09 a big issue with small investors is FUNDING

worry is not that stocks come down ,problem is we not left money to grab them now
2748 2018-06-05 00:37:28 My husband and I have been waiting for this to happen. I want ARMY to have those stocks, to prevent outsiders mucking things up for our guys.
2749 2018-06-05 00:36:48 I had to sell all my stocks on you fools.
2750 2018-06-05 00:36:20 I saw some Mom armys are trying to get the stocks with their husbands 
2751 2018-06-05 00:35:46 we have so many elder armys in our fandom who are nice and ot7 supporter AND rich. if bighit actually goes public, PLEASE buy all the stocks. we don't need random people taking decisions for our boys NO.
2752 2018-06-05 00:35:33 We have two new apps that are using the rumored Marzipan framework; News and Stocks. How many diehard pundits will hate them and say they diminish the Mac experience? I heard a lot of folks say they didn’t want what it appears News and Stocks have done.
2753 2018-06-05 00:35:06 Bc you can make bump stocks yourself...and bc raising the age to 21 wouldn't guarantee that someone couldn't get a gun in their hands. Laws are more of a guideline than a rule...if you want to break the law...youll find a way...speeding is easy, driving intoxicated is as well...
2754 2018-06-05 00:35:00 you're Mr. FT%!! It would be different yes but I still would say he's a decidedly worse prospect than those guys. 3PT volume and stocks are both important. But again, I like Huerter! Just think there are other guys in late-lottery I'd rather take.
2755 2018-06-05 00:34:51 And that's there are 5 or 6 stocks holding up the whole market?
2756 2018-06-05 00:34:44 Can people save mpmey to buy stocks in the name of ARMY is ever things goes awry with board directors and big shareholders?
2757 2018-06-05 00:34:37 I really hope the boys buy a big part of the stocks, so they can have a word in the company and their group... This could be a double edged weapon
2758 2018-06-05 00:34:32 Does this happen when other stocks get added? Seems like something people should be able to anticipate pretty easily, no?
2759 2018-06-05 00:34:30 shit what would happen if other entertainment companies tried to get stocks
2760 2018-06-05 00:34:23 I'm a day trader and I work hard

I trade sex partners, though, instead of stocks, which is the joke I am sticking with
2761 2018-06-05 00:33:45 Seoul stocks open lower on profit-taking http://30.1.1.228:8198/AEN20180605002800320
2762 2018-06-05 00:33:17 If you had 2k why didn't you buy at 0033 and sell at 0037? Sounds like you screwed yourself.. Hell why not sell at 0035 0036 if you get shaken that easy..stocks may not be your thing
2763 2018-06-05 00:33:06 @ people who aren't sure: they sell parts of their company to the public as stocks in return for $ to finance their operations (equity)..not usually bad; many large companies need more funding as they expand (just means BH will have to consider shareholders when making decisions)
2764 2018-06-05 00:32:56 ok so when the fuck are we collecting the money for those stocks because-
2765 2018-06-05 00:32:46 Stocks could too and he’ll pick dat pocket..
2766 2018-06-05 00:32:03 Stocks vest tomorrow 
2767 2018-06-05 00:32:03 Stocks app is updated after neglect in several iterations of iOS. Not sure how much Apple News app would fit to all of this, but lets see. I'm open top it, for now. #wwdc18
2768 2018-06-05 00:31:44 Do you plan to start  Day Trading stocks memberships anytime like stocks from $ 50 to $ 150 range. Reason for asking is I know many friends who day trade and swing stocks they don't know options and need help with stocks.
2769 2018-06-05 00:31:41 Oh I didn’t say it was a good deal did I ? But the pipeline will be built and that is great for Alberta and Canada - albeit the investment is steep. With all due respect, I don’t appreciate the suggestion that I don’t understand money or stocks - it’s unfair and you are wrong.

2772 2018-06-05 00:29:54 If they really wanted to blow people’s minds they would have added bitcoin  tracking to stocks. All the kids are into them bitcons.
2773 2018-06-05 00:29:31 Yes if Bighit go public anyone can buy there stocks and this has both sides too ;-;
2774 2018-06-05 00:28:32 stocks traded today

2775 2018-06-05 00:28:27 And stocks. Twice. SO AMAZING.
2776 2018-06-05 00:27:57 I am not that knowledgeable about this topic, but it means BH would start selling stocks of their company. I am so torn about this tho.
2777 2018-06-05 00:27:34 Not to mention....stocks go down...and Standard is getting "Poorer"!
2778 2018-06-05 00:26:25 There are a few things Austin disagrees with the president on.
One is the wall obviously but I know Austin personally and he does want strong border security.

Another one is that President Trump wants to ban bump stocks.
That is infringement on 2A rights.
2779 2018-06-05 00:26:06 Oh lawd, Supergirl taking on bump stocks. 

I'm going to clean the house.
2780 2018-06-05 00:23:41 Hmm interesting that the Mormon Church owns $1.3 billion worth of big pharma stocks AND opposes medical marijuana

2783 2018-06-05 00:21:57 I have 2% of my portfolio in EEM ETF. Stocks seem to be holding up better than credit and currencies. I also have 5% in emerging market Gov bonds, which is probably a bad choice (USD issuance). Gut says Fed slows QT and keeps with the interest rate schedule as per the dot plot.
2784 2018-06-05 00:20:08 Thanks! Agreed I'm seeing other cannabis stocks perk up too like $CRON
2785 2018-06-05 00:19:49 Stocks are awesome. There is no better place to have your money than the market
2786 2018-06-05 00:19:16 Ya, I know the feeling. I have had several like that. At this point the shit stocks I still have in my portfolio I just set aside and maybe some day they will move.
2787 2018-06-05 00:19:09 We can ban bump stocks

2792 2018-06-05 00:14:40 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2793 2018-06-05 00:14:31 @RyanMoore Hi ryan. Is the NRA is opposed to banning bump stocks? I've read it opposes banning them. If so, how is that gun safety advocacy? Just wondering how to explain that. Thanks
2794 2018-06-05 00:14:23 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2796 2018-06-05 00:13:49 Speculation on WS still a big concern for fed in my view. If they back down now, they risk not being tough enough, and never bringing stocks back to earth.This may be at cost of EM’s but Powell has made comment on this previously, indicating its a sacrifice he’s willing to make

2802 2018-06-05 00:08:46 You still have to keep tabs on it to see if the investment is working and makes sense from a fundamental point of view. This is basic stuff. Common sense. Nobody said be blind. If someone can't understand that they shouldn't be investing directly in stocks.

2807 2018-06-05 00:05:21 Saved what?? He used tax payer dollars to fund his union buddys.  Then gave the US tax payer assets (stocks) away for nothing. Yeah great guy and politician but a terrible business person who  was entrusted to protect our tax dollars.
2808 2018-06-05 00:03:40 So the iOS 12 Stocks loses one of its trademark interactions; you can no longer see a full-screen chart by switching to landscape orientation.
2809 2018-06-05 00:03:33 Trueeee! Zoie you could always learn how to trade stocks or the foreign exchange, or maybe even do affiliate marketing and you could keep your name out there in a good and positive way. Just do what means the most to you, the money will follow
2810 2018-06-05 00:03:20 Oh yeah:  stocks up and down, up and down, nothing to brag about.  Tariffs ruining the farmers!!!  Hundreds of store closures!!  Yeah, keep talking!
2811 2018-06-05 00:00:18 He is bad luck for stocks.
