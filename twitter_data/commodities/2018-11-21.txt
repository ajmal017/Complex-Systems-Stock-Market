62 2018-11-21 20:45:25 It's still not accurate. Russia is not an industrially advanced country and Russian capitalists aren't having trouble finding markets for their goods in local markets so they aren't exporting capital instead of commodities.

I was thinking that even a developed nation has stood against increasing the prices of commodities.

Governments all over the world are really sucking their people lives.
86 2018-11-21 19:14:45 Sure. A commodity isn’t registered - butter or oranges are commodities. As are gold and silver. These are different in their form. Bitcoin has gold like attributes, but better in many ways. I tweeted a good article out about this the other day.

116 2018-11-21 17:57:28 How are basic commodities this expensive? Yesterday I bought 83 units ka 100 bucks. How did we arrive here?
117 2018-11-21 17:56:25 Meanwhile, the price of the commodities on which so many of these countries depend fell, decreasing the amount of money they had to pay back their loans.

118 2018-11-21 17:56:06 “...If your strategy bets on the movement of commodities and isn’t durable enough to survive the movement of commodities...” 
119 2018-11-21 17:51:03 Haha, I wasn’t saying the above because I was ridiculing energy.  It was because I was buying and have been buying.  Even bought oil the commodity itself last couple days.  Which is why it felt so brutal to me.  I have a very large skew towards commodities in my portfolio
120 2018-11-21 17:44:14 I am interested in personal gains and I stand by BJP.

You know nothing whats happening in Courts but I do even the Judge OP saini.

These are salable commodities and making Justice of the same
121 2018-11-21 17:43:47 They are now commodities maybe kungohukura kkk
122 2018-11-21 17:40:58 @donaever In Capital, Marx describes a seller pricing commodities as sticking "their tongue in their heads," which makes me rethink the meaning of the moths in Perdido Street Station
123 2018-11-21 17:37:14 We are 5% of population but use ~20% of most commodities globally. Whether we like it or not, we cannot retreat from the globe and sustain our level of consumption.  We are a part of this global economy NO MATTER WHAT. I’d rather lead it vs react to it. Price maker v price taker.
124 2018-11-21 17:37:14 Hael Saeed Ananm grp of one of the biggest basic commodities producers and importers have announced that they will reduce the cost of its goods to reflect the new reduced exchange rate of Yemeni rial to US $. Hope other businesses follow suit to alleviate the burden of Yemenis
125 2018-11-21 17:35:00 Congratulations PM Sir. Your #मन_की_बात has made the huge difference in the marketing & sales of Khadi across #India.
 
Do you think their are other common usage items or commodities which can also be pushed to people through your dialogue on Radio.
@narendramodi
126 2018-11-21 17:34:39 Prices are lower because our banks can get more money from overdraft fees instead of commodities trade on the Market...thanks to Trump rolling back bank regulations...you're still paying for it either way folks
127 2018-11-21 17:34:34 Vamos acabar com a Indústria nacional.Também vamos abrir o nosso mercado para a soja americana e outras commodities. E vamos exportar nossos políticos engenhosos que vão revolucionar o mundo. Por falar nisso,o prezado Secretário tem sido barrado nos embarques pros Estados Unidos?
128 2018-11-21 17:29:07 Also I think you're missing the demand aspect of XRP. If it powers the entire financial infrastructure, you're talking about settling securities, commodities, new use cases, etc. If I handed you a smart phone before apps you would say "this is a waste"
129 2018-11-21 17:25:25 and likely why they are valued. You could not be more correct about data. It's why I always discount/ignore forecasts for top and bottom ranges. Especially in commodities, like $20 oil.
130 2018-11-21 17:21:47 In California a few decades later, it was pretty standard to record exchanges in 'reales" even though the actual medium of exchange was credit that would be paid off in commodities.
131 2018-11-21 17:20:28 Alberta oil is selling nearly $40/bbl less than WTI, and 50 less than Brent. So the savings  to the USA is YUUUGE.

CBC does not understand fungible commodities. If Saudi was not keeping world oil prices down, Alberta oil would be more expensive.
132 2018-11-21 17:16:17 What has me puzzled is that inflation does not seem to be driving the movement. Traditionally, late cycle inflation is thought to drive movement to commodities and EM. This time looks like more value driven.
133 2018-11-21 17:15:01 I am still confused as to why the word “currency” is attached to these commodities. A currency has to be relatively stable to be of any use otherwise no one uses it for purchases. A 90% swing isn’t stability. Hyper inflationary currencies can’t last, so can cryptos?

141 2018-11-21 16:59:02 Inflation reduced , essential commodities reduced substantially,
142 2018-11-21 16:51:03 If they accept the Sunami of escalating prices of  commodities will be there and public and opposition will make the life of Govt impossible !

144 2018-11-21 16:44:33 This started 60 years ago!  Once migrants were given gov't commodities, like cheese, butter, peanut butter, etc.  They raised hell cuz they didn't like the food, so the gov't "instituted" food stamps.  NOW they just get free, prepaid credit cards!
145 2018-11-21 16:38:22 A cotação das commodities na bolsa de chicago tá nas alturas. Essa mesma galera fez um choramingüé louco pra terem crédito agrícola pelo BB a prazos infinitos a partir de 2003. Conheço sim....
146 2018-11-21 16:35:52 1/ In sum, your case = "If the capital flows [measured strictly in USD] don't start again then 4 billion people will starve to death for lack of USDs."  

I assure you, they won't.  If oil & other commodities are priced in USD & CNY, & CNY falls v. USD, commodities will crash.
147 2018-11-21 16:34:02 Hey dirty Donnie, Saudi Arabia does not control oil prices,they are set by the commodities market. Low oil prices does not excuse murder. Besides, Canada is our largest supplier, NOT Saudi Arabia. Thanks Canada!!
148 2018-11-21 16:32:19 China is built on US capital via the trade imbalance , if these  capital flows don't start again  there is a vast engine of construction and growth that can't get fed the commodities they need can't get bought , commodities are already crashing
149 2018-11-21 16:24:54 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
150 2018-11-21 16:23:53 I think you should stop thinking of people as mere commodities for the use of "companies", and rather think what's best for people as people. The question is always arising, because people will always emigrate, particularly under the stress of capitalism, imperialism, war, etc.
151 2018-11-21 16:14:50 I seriously don't get it when you guys keep saying that we are out of recession, pls whats the price of food commodities in the market? How will a common man in the street feels that we are out of recession
152 2018-11-21 16:13:09 We do time cycles on 200 + equities, indices, commodities, currencies - so we are broad, yes. We have a core focus to OIL, GOLD, SILVER, SPY, VIX, DXY, CRYPTO, and 200 + Swing equities we follow.
153 2018-11-21 16:12:51 I think you can advocate movement of people vs movement of commodities /shrug
154 2018-11-21 16:11:01 Agreed.  This is why IMO CNY oil & gold contracts so critical.  China's non-commodity goods trade surplus is ~$700B per IIF.  If China uses gold to gain ability to print CNY for oil & other commodities, China will NOT hit the wall 1st re: BoP...US govt will.
155 2018-11-21 16:04:03 It's more complicated than you make it to be, though. You live in a deeply patriarchal society entrenched in caste heirarchies, where the 'higher' up you go in castes, the more control is exerted over women by devicing them as commodities, since 1/2
156 2018-11-21 16:01:39 When I first got into commodities, no one was interested in a diversified approach. Nobody before had looked at the whole picture and had taken a diversified position with the idea of cutting losses short and going with a trend.
157 2018-11-21 15:59:43 Commodities are broadly recovering ground as the US dollar weakens on the day (-0.2%). Crude oil is up 1.7% and gold has advanced 0.6%
158 2018-11-21 15:53:05 #EstudiantesDeLaPatria #ElPetro estabilizador, Criptomoneda con funciones básicas de una moneda: Unidad de Cuenta, Medio de Pago y Reserva de Valor. Con diferencia que se basa en criptografía y valor anclado a la cesta de commodities.
159 2018-11-21 15:49:17 Pls stop this nonsense. Oil is amongst items termed commodities ie bauxite, gold, silver, etc. Their prices are internationally based on spec, quality etc. Refined petroleum price is hinged on crude oil price. If crude price rises, petrol price rises. Vice versa.
160 2018-11-21 15:40:55 #SaudiArabia?  The credit is all yours- #wallstreet and #commodities are moving in response to your almost singled-handed responsibility for moving the world towards a recession.  FYI, check out what happened to #oil prices in 2007.
161 2018-11-21 15:40:40 Olha que belo exemplo da logística de Cuba para com suas commodities, ops médicos .
162 2018-11-21 15:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
163 2018-11-21 15:32:56 Tertiary goals & knock-ons:
- Clog the collections industry
- Bring down the bureaucracy with bankruptcies
- Pressure the creditors generally
- Overall strategic economic gains - this is basically a collectivized leveraged acquisition of useful commodities and services
164 2018-11-21 15:28:38 Lots of commodities looking interesting here from the long side.
165 2018-11-21 15:21:24 La economía de #USA: empleo fuerte, salarios subiendo, fábricas produciendo y la inflación está en la meta. Sin embargo, las acciones se están hundiendo, los yields de los bonos corporativos subiendo y los commodities cayendo. Todas señales de una desaceleración o recesión.
166 2018-11-21 15:20:46 A União Europeia já está em desaceleração também. Estaria surgindo um novo ciclo de alta nas commodities, e caindo no colo do Bozo?
167 2018-11-21 15:20:45 Totally wrong..I work in commodities... oil glut, USA produces more oil now than Saudi, in fact Saudi & Russia talking production cuts to RAISE price, either Trump is stupid or lying ... most likely Both!
168 2018-11-21 15:20:14 A low starting inventory level and below-average net injections of   natural gas into storage contributed to working natural gas stocks   ending the refill season at this relatively low level.  #NatGas #Commodities #Energy
169 2018-11-21 15:18:33 In UNGA event on the Transatlantic Slave Trade, @UN_PGA urges delegations to reject racial prejudice and all forms of inequality and exclusion. #Bahamas (@CARICOMorg) cites the colonial devastation of people "treated as commodities."
170 2018-11-21 15:15:20 Are you crazy??
I work in commodities.. oil glut not the Saudi .. America produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, as a matter of fact Saudi and Russia talking oil production cuts to hike price.. either Trump totally stupid or Lying... or more likely BOTH
171 2018-11-21 15:14:44 Another Trump lie.  Saudi Arabia doesn't set oil prices.  Oil is traded on the commodities market, and no one country sets prices.
172 2018-11-21 15:10:52 Folks,, comparing Brent prices to to WTI prices is silly. Also, WTI is the global benchmark, not something you treat with cranberry juice. I am definitely someone who always knew that even before covering energy commodities.
173 2018-11-21 15:10:04 Had anyone told him about OPEC and the commodities exchange?
174 2018-11-21 15:05:01 Instagram is a catelogue for two commodities

Ladies window shop and comment and get reviews on the accessories

Men buy the true commodity and negotiate in the DM

It's a digital whore house
175 2018-11-21 14:54:57 Increased cost of essential commodities? Inflation is at 3.4% if I remember correctly. Farmer org's are unhappy that prices are not high enough. 

The tax rate of 5% was introuduced in 2017 and most people that previously fell in 10% bracket saw their taxes halved.
176 2018-11-21 14:53:17 Yeah but that's the point they can't buy their commodities for RMB nobody wants it . 50% of all debt is denominated in USD , 23% Yen then Euro , RMB is less than 1% . RMB is 30% over valued as it is as it's an atrociously managed currency .
177 2018-11-21 14:50:49 The other thing I'd add: This dynamic is why CNY oil/commodities is so critical.  China's non-commodity goods trade surplus is $700B.  If China can price oil & commodities in their own currency, China will not have cash flow (BoP) issues before the US or somewhere else does.
178 2018-11-21 14:49:52 #Bitcoin is down 75 percent from high of $20,000 last December. 
Its 1-year basis is a 30% loss.
But its 5-year basis is the best performing asset class, overshadowing commodities, currencies, stocks and bonds. 

This is just one reason we love #cryptocurrency. It's bonkers.
179 2018-11-21 14:46:29 Speaking with @kirillklip today, part of our daily commodities discussion, and I mentioned I am comfortable with all market gyrations due to hedging habits.

I noted, whilst the market was 'puking' yesterday I was playing chess.

Hedging is 'peace of mind' portfolio management.
180 2018-11-21 14:42:21 Love your charts  keep them coming!
Can you recommend a platform to trade forex/commodities? Maybe one accepting bitcoins.
181 2018-11-21 14:38:41 ...lose, cut losses and run....want to try to pick a bottom, be my guess, it may never come back or it could go to near 0 or 0.  different assets act differently along with their stocks, it depends on balance sheet while others like commodities and for example BTC, another story.
182 2018-11-21 14:34:09 Trump might actually be this dumb. He thanked Saudi Arabia for low gas prices.  They dont set oil pricee..commodities do
183 2018-11-21 14:32:07 China's non-commodity goods surplus is $700B.  Means their deficits are in commodities.  Means if they can simply price commodities in CNY, china will not have BoP problems before the US does.

185 2018-11-21 14:25:17 We've used a lot of stuff as SoVs throughout history, including grains and other commodities. Even nowadays, common SoVs are bonds, real estate, oil and equities, all of which have "utility". I don't see why Bitcoin's uselessness makes it a better SoV.
186 2018-11-21 14:20:04 Trump wants the markets to crash!. It means real estate, commodities and resources sold off cheaply and he and crony wall street faction buy it all up dirt cheap!. That's the game plan people to screw you all!. He will cause another GFC be sure of it!.
187 2018-11-21 14:18:18 One could easily imagine Nasdaq declining >25%. Do you think the decline will be very steep in commodities? E.g. could we see crude below $30 and copper below $2.00?

191 2018-11-21 14:12:20 Not to be pedantic, but is stock price manipulation effectuated by trading a security in all circumstances outlawed? I will note, for example, that while spoofing is illegal in commodities markets, there are no SEC cases that directly hit the issue. Nor is there an SEC rule on it

198 2018-11-21 13:59:18 Sure.. but the inflation will go lower... look at indicators like commodities or the latest retail earnings... does not look good. Think about all of these indicators and the FED is raising rates..you’ll understand the economy is slowing down.
199 2018-11-21 13:56:26 Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.

Ignore the noise, trust the code.

203 2018-11-21 13:28:10 "O alinhamento de Jair Bolsonaro com Donald Trump pode custar caro para a agricultura brasileira"

vc quis dizer pode custar caro pro BRASIL inteiro, não só a agricultura, já que uns 80-85% das exportações desse país é carne e commodities
204 2018-11-21 13:26:11 BOTTOM LINE 
Commodities are extremely volatile. Markets never value commodites properly. Most always r over or undervalued. Oil is the easiest to value because it has a predetermined value (By world leaders) of $75 per barrel.

224 2018-11-21 11:38:06 It’s not a threat it’s a new age of currency, like people hated worthless metal coins and paper when they use to trade in gold and commodities and have to cart it around instead of paper notes and coins
225 2018-11-21 11:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
226 2018-11-21 11:35:58 

You know nothing, but you keep doubling down in the hope someone believes you.

I find it unbelievable that you think the rule of supply and demand only applies to commodities. It applies to any financial transaction.

Snake.
227 2018-11-21 11:29:23 I do all I can to avoid buying commodities with palm oil in it.  I swear the ingredients list is printed smaller and smaller.  Poor vision is not uncommon and the law should stop industry from printing so small.
228 2018-11-21 11:14:22 Some Sh14 billion was lost in the export of major commodities such as coffee and tea. #GuardianOfTaxEvaders
229 2018-11-21 11:11:52 It's because the prices of commodities are influenced by many factors... Supply is just one... You might find that the milk producers focused on the export market thus starving the local market. .... So local market supply might have dropped.
230 2018-11-21 10:56:54 Ruby really is a gem. It is inconceivable to think that Ruby and all the others were born only to be commodities, with no value as individual living, feeling beings. But for use as 'products' or 'stock' 
231 2018-11-21 10:56:42 thats because their economy is the export of fish, gas and oil - those commodities don't need trade deals and cant be regulated
232 2018-11-21 10:54:34 All economic pointers are in the negative under @MBuhari fall in value of the naira, hike in fuel price, rice in cost of basic commodities, been public utilities are more expensive, the people are suffering, total breakdown on security highlighted by the herdsmen attack...

235 2018-11-21 10:50:45 This will continue as long as we treat people like commodities

240 2018-11-21 10:33:03 Claro que temos. Reservas super valiosas e, Commodities de altíssimo valor para o mercado mundial. Somos tão ricos quanto os EUA hoje. Mas tudo isso precisa reverter em crescimento sócio-econômico para o povo brasileiro. Serão ao estilo à la Bolsonaro.
241 2018-11-21 10:26:41 Entendo que o que a sociedade brasileira num país exportador de commodities, logo dólar alto interessa, é ter preço de combustível barato. Nada contra investir em descobrir e vender petróleo bruto, mas vender ativos que vendem e produzem gasolina, diesel e GLP é contra o povo.
242 2018-11-21 10:14:47 What about falling per capita GDP growth inspite of commodities boom?

AMCU will not allow this inequality to continue. Commodities are sold in Dollars but the mine workers are paid in Rands. The increase of the gold price and the weakening of the rand means the company profits.

257 2018-11-21 08:21:57 The same people who are whining about the cuts are the same ones who neither watched nor did pay for these commodities. It's all about profitability.

260 2018-11-21 08:02:51 Depresses me mate. Country’s are just businesses and we’re commodities and that’s life.
261 2018-11-21 08:01:21 100% agree. Business leaders are often guilty of using ‘possessive’ language - describing their people as if they are commodities. It’s no wonder there’s a disconnect between those at the top of the organisation and everyone else.

266 2018-11-21 07:43:34 Those who make $ trading in financial & commodities markets say it's one of several signs indicating markets are anticipating a global economic slowdown. But if your rationalization lets you feel good about Trump giving the Crown Price a mulligan on murder, go for it.
267 2018-11-21 07:41:26 Ffs donating basic commodities to the masses is not evidence of good governance. It’s a fatal flaw in the works & no amount of donated rice will fix that.
268 2018-11-21 07:40:07 That’s exactly the problem. A backbone and high ethics are scarce commodities in that cabinet.

274 2018-11-21 07:28:09 Even commodities with real utility (ie not bitcoin) can trade below production cost for years. The stock of bitcoin ‘above ground’ also dwarfs the flow of coins being mined. Foolish to think the cost curve matters to price.

276 2018-11-21 07:22:20 The way international markets in commodities work is that if we put tariffs on beans to China, the Chinese purchase in the Brazil market.  That increases the price for Brazilian beans so OTHER countries who do not face a tariff then come to the US to purchase our beans.
277 2018-11-21 07:05:37 This is the same thing Buhari tried in '85 with his price control attempts on "essential commodities" like milk, sugar and so on that caused them to become scarce and very expensive!!

Obviously, Buhari doesn't understand that such moves automatically lead to hoarding!
278 2018-11-21 06:59:12 @hedgeequities @SEBI_India I closed my account with you years back & still getting statements on commodities segment (which I never opened with you). No action taken after repeated emails to your team...
279 2018-11-21 06:46:43 Hmmm...well, should have said, we #queuejumped again to Germany, using our treaty rights of freedom of movement, trusting the German and EU27 governments more.  We have left our friends, work, communities due to the uncertainty and being commodities.

287 2018-11-21 06:08:55 so as the Chinese credit contraction worsens and their balance of payment deficit continues or narrows , their demand for all commodities will fall (anyone noticed the oil price lately ?)
288 2018-11-21 06:07:59 Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

289 2018-11-21 06:07:44 No, I'm saying unscrupulous business pple are taking advantage of you the ordinary citizen who has little or no access to the USD and charging basic commodities in US so if they are that selfish and doing it to us despite these economic challenges let ZIMRA do it to them as well
290 2018-11-21 06:06:39 Make no mistake friends, Trump today destroyed our biggest commodities and negotiating tools. He destroyed our Moral, Ethical and Principles in the world's eyes.

291 2018-11-21 05:59:53 So what. Seems like house prices go up and house prices down - as do most commodities these days.

299 2018-11-21 05:12:52 Because having truck loads of money doesn’t guarantee development in terms of sick and patriarchial mentality, so sad that in times like where countries are leading women empowerment campaign , women are still treated like commodities in some parts of the world! Disgusting!

301 2018-11-21 05:02:12 Reserve currencies are used by businesses to save money and buy (or sell) in commodities markets. They can, theoretically get a better deal. These markets are almost all dollar markets.

304 2018-11-21 04:36:35 When we fail to defend a child’s right to their mother and father, children become commodities to be cut and pasted into any kind of household.

332 2018-11-21 01:51:01 I see a lot of commodities and stocks ready to jump off the cliff its a telltale sign that there will be an era of turmoil in the next decade
333 2018-11-21 01:50:39 Everything is down, not just crypto. Stocks, commodities, real estate, etc. We just gotta weather the storm and cost average along the way.
334 2018-11-21 01:49:34 @Lagarde : As if central banks digital ballance sheet never existed. And banks clearing house didnt exist.  She sold herself to grab a little attention like 5 years spoiled  kids. Or she just clueless... Or she is in a shitcoin deal for commodities of a third world countrie
335 2018-11-21 01:46:14 List of high value, low cost office kitchen commodities.
1. Clean fork
2. Clean teaspoon

Employers would do well to invest in these resources
336 2018-11-21 01:44:45 Where was I sexist? I just can’t stand those who are against oppression but the moment you mention the oppression of non human animals they dismiss the whole vegan movement and talk about animals as if they’re stupid garbage commodities.
337 2018-11-21 01:40:17 Si sos una economía que quiere exportar, siempre vas a depender de lo que te compre el resto del mundo. Los asiáticos nos compraban soja. Que pasó? Entraron en crisis y dejaron de comprarle a todo el mundo. Cayó el precio de los commodities y reventamos nosotros también
338 2018-11-21 01:32:14 Multi currency pricing/settlement of commodities structurally reduces global need to hold (primarily USD denominated) FX reserves.  Means US deficits will matter again
339 2018-11-21 01:30:59 Hay una literatura menos conocida sobre las otras inversiones de Keynes (i.e. Wall Street). Le fue bastante mejor que con futuros y commodities. Cuando hablo de "consensos" me refiero a lo que dicen los historiadores, que entiendo es lo más cercano a la realidad que hay
340 2018-11-21 01:27:41 Things that are not backed by real assets like gold, securities, commodities. Saying this is like telling crypto people their deity is a false idol. I don't even like saying this kind of stuff over Twitter bc of the emotional backlash it usually incites.
341 2018-11-21 01:23:05 Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.

It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.

It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.

Ignore the noise, trust the code.
342 2018-11-21 01:19:52 Brent crude corrected another 6.4% to $62.5/bbl and is trading flattish currently   #Commodities #markets
343 2018-11-21 01:02:32 How about this then, Toby. My sources witnessed girls on motorbikes selling water, drugs and arms at tranques in Leon in their neighbourhoods. Only one of those commodities is required in a peaceful protest! Any coverage? NO!
344 2018-11-21 00:55:56 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,220.40
LME Nickel: 11,082.50

USDPHP: 52.51
345 2018-11-21 00:49:18 Ofcourse it does, a not too nuanced analysis of the underlying driver of growth would have indicated it was all commodity driven, and given the inherent cyclicality of commodities it was bound to correct.
346 2018-11-21 00:48:10 Thoughtful Americans have no interest in Whitaker’s opinion given he his the least qualified AG in recent history. His resume includes:
- Marketing “time travel commodities “
- Marketing the Masculine Men’s Toilets 
- Selling flatbed trailers
#WhitakerIsNotQualified
347 2018-11-21 00:42:35 That's a tiny segment of the population in Europe and America. What was responsible for "Africa Rising"? Boom in demand for commodities from China.

Was also there last decade, crude stereotypes of Africa still dominate.
348 2018-11-21 00:40:08 #Commodities 19/11/2018

349 2018-11-21 00:35:02 Umm no, it’s because sales are falling below expectations. And why is that? Wages are stagnant but cost of commodities keep going up.  All those tax cuts that big business got? They used them to buy back their own stocks. Trickle down economics DO NOT F’ING WORK!!!!
350 2018-11-21 00:27:51 Seguramente. También la moda cayó en un momento jodido para todo, bonos, equity, commodities, peso argentino (?
351 2018-11-21 00:20:17 No fixed price anything.  Alberta has moved closer to a free market for commodities so that would be a step back.  Producers need to own the pipeline capacity though.
352 2018-11-21 00:12:24 Depressing hour watching #school .  Let's hope it was not just teachers watching it.  Austerity doesn't work.  And children are not commodities or products.  Schools are not businesses.
353 2018-11-21 00:00:05 You realize that every mtg store profits at other people's expense? You realize that people have been buy/sell/trade commodities forever? You realize that James' source is not a content creator? There was no insider "leak". You can get good information, eg: the number crunch
