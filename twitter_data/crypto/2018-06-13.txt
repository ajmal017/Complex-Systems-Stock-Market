4 2018-06-13 23:59:16 Crypto is the best thing that happened to the world!
5 2018-06-13 23:59:04 Hate seeing ignorance overtaking the minds of lots of great people, anyone who says or thinks $BTC can ever go to $0 needs to wake up!

If it had value before 10+ billion invested, it will easily after. 

It's just what will the bottom be..
$6000?
$4000?
$3500?

11 2018-06-13 23:57:38 Are you able to add a .AX as well when posting stock updates please. Example $BUB $BUB.AX
