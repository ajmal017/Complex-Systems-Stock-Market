86 2018-07-24 23:48:20 I agree and hope this plays out like your chart. But with so much upward momentum (compared to last leg up) do the 100 and 200 Ema act as resistance? I feel like it would bounce off of one of those first?

102 2018-07-24 23:45:31 BTC transfer takes over an hour, EOS transaction takes consistently half a second. 

In my opinion BTC's days are pretty numbered as people move from "what is crypto", to "getting some BTC", to "wanting tx's that don't take forever".

Main thing for currency is tx time. Simple

156 2018-07-24 23:38:25 Well I think we all know what is going to happen soon. Bitcoin is going to continue to kill alts, but you won't be dead yet. No, when you actually die is when BTC plummets, so now it your USD value will join your BTC value in the netherregions of hell. This will be very painful
157 2018-07-24 23:38:20 doesn't seem any more idiotic or baseless than the trading "insights" on crypto Twitter

188 2018-07-24 23:31:15 I’m glad to hear that! Crypto really is the way forward. Interesting to hear you hold DGB.. do you not find it a better way to transact compared to bitcoin or is that most people use bitcoin? I would imagine cheaper fees, speed and price would be more appealing than bitcoin?
189 2018-07-24 23:31:12 Continually coming across crypto startups with "volunteer analysts" on their teams. Guessing this is a fancy way to say unpaid intern?
190 2018-07-24 23:30:49 Well he's absolutely right , in the states a lot of banks auto cancel crypto purchases. And force you to call in , then u need to wait for some asshole on hold for 15 minutes to tell him to authorize it,only decent bank I found for large transactions is Wells Fargo without issues
191 2018-07-24 23:30:42 What I think will happen:

1) BTC pumps to  ~9-10k
2) Alts start rallying close to the top
3) BTC starts dropping while alts do really well
4) BTC dumps hard
5) Alts dump hard
6) Everyone complains about the whales
7) I buy BTC back at 4k
8) ETF gets approved

& the cycle repeats
192 2018-07-24 23:30:27 Who’s attacking you?

You choose not to play their card game anymore. Their game is politics. Ours is crypto. We start using tools like bitcoin cash to undermine the system at a fundamental level. 

That is how we stop them.

- start transacting in #Crypto
- stop watching mass media
- stop allowing apps access to your location and phone

437 2018-07-24 22:49:39 counting calories is easy - figure out a daily meal plan that fits your macros, and that tastes good. And eat that 7 days a week. Kinda boring, but always works for me and I never have to think/track excessively cos I planned it out from the start.
438 2018-07-24 22:49:36 Oh you will!  When I figure out how to upload the VHS tape from the camcorder.
439 2018-07-24 22:49:27 I would have to disagree on your Asics comment. GPU mining is like having a Ford Tempo and Asic mining is like driving a fully loaded Chevy Suburban with a 5.3 L V8. You get more out of that then a 4-cylinder Ford.
440 2018-07-24 22:49:14 who wanna teach me bout crypto currency

442 2018-07-24 22:49:09 本質的にはそれらがSNS自体の原動力でもあるので、ある意味仕方ないですが疲れますよね。
生業にするのでなければ、目立たず気が向いた範囲でやるのが吉なツールなんでしょうね 笑
443 2018-07-24 22:49:06 And SHARK WEEK...
444 2018-07-24 22:48:56 Just stfu and buy $PIRL
445 2018-07-24 22:48:48 Wanna know what we call this +14% and 7.2m volume? A foreshadowing

447 2018-07-24 22:48:18 Trying to figure out what I want to do to cut, feel like if I don’t do something black and white like low/no carb I always cheat. Hard to count cals
448 2018-07-24 22:47:51 BTC falls below $6,000 and almost 90% of the Crypto self acclaimed experts stop tweeting. BTC climbs up $8,000+ and suddenly they start resurfacing. 

If you are new to the Crypto space , please mind who u follow and who u take analysis from.

My respect to @ToneVays @jimmysong

452 2018-07-24 22:47:33 The vision of this project is very interesting. Kudos to all the devs and creators for all their hardwork and efforts to complete and make this project awesome. Hoping for the success for the benefits of all. #Crypto #Blockchain #TGE #ICO
453 2018-07-24 22:47:33 just being in a deficit with low-ish carbs.
454 2018-07-24 22:47:32 I saw your PRNG talking with the Russians, can't trust it to do it's job. Also that if clause there may fail and somehow your elliptic curve code must check input (conditions on public data are not a side-channel vulnerability).
455 2018-07-24 22:47:29 This Is financial advice .. don’t buy $tel now wait for my orders to go through please. 

$btc $ocn $wtc $eth
456 2018-07-24 22:47:22 Very easy wallet installation, so you can use it right after this simple process.
Not necessary any adjust because all required setting is already hard-coded in the @RPICoin wallet.
Fast synchronization with network due to many connections available.

458 2018-07-24 22:46:46 If the SEC is actually concerned about hype, they would make the decision on August 10th instead of pushing out it to their last possible date of mid Feb
459 2018-07-24 22:46:37 the struggle is real.

461 2018-07-24 22:46:33 i have to say i was skeptical of this call when we were in the low 6s - good work!

463 2018-07-24 22:46:10 そっちはオーガーだな。賭け事と保険を綯い交ぜにした実験トークンだ。来年の作物は今年より豊作かどうかなど、投票して賭けていく。農家は凶作に賭け続けるだけで、勝っても負けても美味しいとこ取りになる。リスクを分散できる優れものだ。予測市場なので凶作予想なら素直に畑を休ませるのも良いぞ。

466 2018-07-24 22:45:31 I was going to point out the same :)
467 2018-07-24 22:45:28 Doing any specific diet?
468 2018-07-24 22:45:23 Ok I just bought $300 in BTC, but I want to trade for $200 of $neo. What do y'all think?
469 2018-07-24 22:45:10 Bitcoin introduced the first crypto-currency, and the 1st transaction was an agreement to exchange 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 Pizzas.  Those would be million dollars’ pizzas by the current price of Bitcoin.  But once again, it was by agreement to exchange Bitcoin for Pizza. #tpesa
470 2018-07-24 22:44:57 @Socal_crypto found your sockpuppet
471 2018-07-24 22:44:54 I think you are right Senor.  It is a good day.  
I'm working to perfect the moves of the lady above so that I can show them off at father daughter dance and bring honor to my family.
472 2018-07-24 22:44:47 Recruiter: “Would u consider SanFran?”
Me: “Sure, if my hit mixtape, crypto currency, web invention and Nigerian scam plan all hit at the same time. Maybe I could buy a 2 bedroom.”

476 2018-07-24 22:43:49 I would agree but coinbase just opened up their Custody accounts w/ a $10M minimum to get into the program and they're gradually onboarding new hedge funds and investors. $crypto is hot right now. May not have time to accumulate.
477 2018-07-24 22:43:45 Btw, not a big fan of X25519 (too small and yes I can check input) and some of the arguments for things like misuse resistance are silly sometimes ("what if our prng, like, goes crazy somehow" ?).
478 2018-07-24 22:43:12 looks like an extension with an extension really frustrating, it measures but still...
479 2018-07-24 22:42:53 lol
480 2018-07-24 22:42:49 That's true, they are pushy.
481 2018-07-24 22:42:37 You used to talk about the dopamine factor and how high it was in 2017, I feel like that’s not there any more (at least in my crypto circles). Most people seem to have tempered expectations with runs like this.
