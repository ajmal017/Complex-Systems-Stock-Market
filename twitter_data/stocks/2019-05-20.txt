Because a company that Maine @mainedcm trusts is a good recommendation for me to buy their stocks
1 2019-05-20 23:59:39 Apparently tesla is the Benjamin Button of stocks. Apple, but backwards. When will they go private and enter the single Los Altos garage?
2 2019-05-20 23:58:37 I’m looking into Starbucks stocks myself bro
3 2019-05-20 23:57:25 I disagree man. A lot of people lost a lot of $$ with $Matic doing exactly that. Think Apple stocks....who made the most money? Those who bought and sat on their stocks over a number of years. Jumping in and out is great to reap short term profit at the risk of losing long term!
4 2019-05-20 23:56:52 Lmao im honestly learning everyday been at it the last two years. I just tell people taken 10% of pay checks and spend 75 on standard stocks and 25% on something risky. It’s what I do

8 2019-05-20 23:54:33 Not only did the owner suddenly spike the rent, she was vindictive and kicked everyone out because someone went public. Outing her isn't exactly stocks in the public square but it's certainly newsworthy. It also helps put a human face on greedy landlords.

11 2019-05-20 23:53:31 Are you more disappointed or upset?  I feel chasing these unregulated speculations to be a function of greed rather than prudent investment so acquiring them would come with some expectation of loss.  Much like many pinksheet or TSV stocks, it's more of a gamble than investment
12 2019-05-20 23:53:05 Ang ganda training ground din ng stocks sa emotions at heart ng tao. Kung ganyan naabutan ko petron, Siguro highest ko na P12-15 na target price, nakakatakot sumabay po sa hype sa taas. Baka nilalaro lang ng ibang investors para marami sumabay. Small wins >>overvalued stocks.
13 2019-05-20 23:52:03 That might introduce too little diversification.  You may not have 10 great ideas all the time. I am not saying it is right it is just an interesting question.  I entered a stock picking competition with 5 stocks.  If it had been for 10-30 stocks my results would have been worse.
14 2019-05-20 23:51:35 I am astonished that Rubio hasn't burst into flames! Maybe he would like to take his case to the real people of Venezuela and try to convince them not put him in stocks in the capital city for the people to show their appreciation.

40 2019-05-20 23:47:06 How do u reconcile your long stocks ( from goog, to tsla, to energy to materials ) and your shorts( Ma , Etsy ) with all of these inverse etfs and tvix). It seems like you are hedging every which way ?
41 2019-05-20 23:46:45 You sell your big tobacco stocks?
42 2019-05-20 23:46:38 Damm should i drop my Ford stocks??
43 2019-05-20 23:44:59 I have just bought bitcoin of large sums.
Knowing my luck, it will probably crash in the morning.
I can't even sleep.
Those of you who buy stocks, how do you sleep at night please?
44 2019-05-20 23:41:58 Imagine us being all rich enough to buy SM stocks.......
45 2019-05-20 23:39:00 Everyone who’s invested in stocks of index etfs knows this. It’s brutal out there.  Other than software
46 2019-05-20 23:37:36 So, I sold before earnings. Around $197 (2 separate sell orders). Earnings came out, it soars to $208 or $209. I'm bummed (a little, stuck to my methodology). Today closed at $183.67 (rough day for tech stocks). So a good sell. I watch it closely. Great company, always beat earn.
47 2019-05-20 23:37:21 Just like there other stocks that are not at the ATH. Which we have many. Like tencent this month. Guess you dont get portfolios....
48 2019-05-20 23:34:41 Headline in todays WSJ:

"Everyone Hates Healthcare Stocks, Buy Them Anyway."

Not precisely true. I love Healthcare Stocks. 
And yes, "Buy Them Anyway."

50 2019-05-20 23:33:58 Politics finance and stocks pretty much
51 2019-05-20 23:32:39 I read the first breakdown, here's the thing, there are 4000 stocks to trade or 19,000 including OTC, why disrupt one that we need to succeed, even if he's a dickwad/nerd/crook.  we need Tesla, before them who was talking EV's or batteries? No-one.
52 2019-05-20 23:32:36 A rare idea put into practice: holding stocks long term. But bingo, man does does it work! The lists here the evidence. Amazing more don’t follow this strategy and complicate things. My longest is NFLX since 2012 and it’s been sweet! I only buy stocks to hold long term now.
53 2019-05-20 23:32:30 Buy stocks
54 2019-05-20 23:32:00 girls take longer in the bathroom because we are checking our stocks

57 2019-05-20 23:28:45 Waste of a tweet. Go to Facebook with this kind of stuff. Tweet about stocks and markets please.
58 2019-05-20 23:27:31 What a hypocrite, the man who sold our gold stocks and supported not putting money into the pension pot for years so the people would benefit, no he was happy letting the working class wait another 7 years to get their pension dues.
59 2019-05-20 23:26:24 Aussie shares are set for a softer start on Tuesday. #SPI -41pts or -0.63%. Keep in mind local stocks surged by 1.74% on Monday, which was the best day in 3.5 months  & the market hit an 11.5 year high following the surprise election outcome #ausbiz

62 2019-05-20 23:25:09 All funds benchmark against $SPX 

After all, as investors, we have the option of choosing stocks from all industries.

I have faith in my method of investing/hedging strategy so owning an ETF doesn't make sense for me.
63 2019-05-20 23:21:53 $OSTK director buys 40,000 stocks. Recent Form-4
64 2019-05-20 23:21:36 Thank you so much for sharing? How did you get the information about these stocks?
65 2019-05-20 23:21:23 It is unpatriotic to support the Brexit party when the truth finally comes out and the wrong doers are brought to book there are going to be a very angry mob of ex members demanding their fee back together with Farage in stocks, no one likes to be made a fool.  He is a blight
66 2019-05-20 23:19:41 @ProfLowell #FINA2209 After hitting the lowest value of stock in many years at $197.00, due to stock market fatigue from Elon Musk, or the scares of bankruptcy talks, but Tesla is still the largest short in dollar-volume of U.S. stocks at $13.1 billion.
67 2019-05-20 23:19:28 Baru nak ajak @Reito_Mizuko cosplay sama2 kat Animagaki coz event kat MIECC. Tapi sayangnye I dah kena transfer and end of month. Kena focus utk count inventory/stocks store. 
68 2019-05-20 23:18:36 @ImKnope and @GrooveCube sometimes wrote including stiletto stocks ??   
69 2019-05-20 23:17:16 It's a milkshake ffs. It's the stocks for the baddies, a modern version of tomatoes and cabbages. Where does the name of the film site " rotten tomatoes" come from? Look at yaxley's thugs reaction to his  "shaking". That is violence, that is assault. A bit of get real is needed.
70 2019-05-20 23:15:22 Market Rally saw heavy buying in financials and property sector pushing them up 5%. Dividend stocks in top 200 all went up by more than 1.5%.
However, - there was very little Institutional buying here with less than 5% having any insto activity.
Recommend Defensive Positions
71 2019-05-20 23:15:17 The events are in the stocks.
72 2019-05-20 23:14:52 yes, buy rik stocks
73 2019-05-20 23:13:18 The real threat to specs in this market is not day traders .. not swing traders .. not positional  traders .. Real threat is these bunch of "T +2" traders.. who obviously don't  have money to buy stocks in the 1st place and they HAVE to sell at ANY prices on Day 2 or 3 .
74 2019-05-20 23:12:35 Thanks for the response, but it goes beyond just my recent interaction.

Everything else aside— The dearth of stocks that are available to borrow is a deal-breaker, particularly given changing market conditions.

(And options contract commissions render that workaround futile.)
75 2019-05-20 23:11:30 2 stocks I will definitely pick up during the recession... #TSLA and #BYND
76 2019-05-20 23:11:28 I'm referring to pokemon trainer switching but tbh I think of the next game when I'm down 2 stocks too lol
77 2019-05-20 23:11:19 US tech stocks took a dive since expected future earnings for some Huawei suppliers had to be revised downwards..
78 2019-05-20 23:10:48 Stocks move in a way best described by Chaos Theory, not just fundamentals or technical indicators. It's why NOBODY can predict the market accurately and consistently
79 2019-05-20 23:09:37 I’d also say that if Brexit happens, we’re going to need pals with bigger boats to keep an eye on our fish stocks. We need to stick together in Europe so that calmer heads will prevail. Sitting on neutral fence was fine with USA & UK there in the background. Different story now.
80 2019-05-20 23:09:04 When you’re bullish the stocks fall. When you’re bearish the stocks rise. Thanks for the indicator mr goober
81 2019-05-20 23:08:38 Stocks rise when companies make money. 

So Dems will make pharma and health care companies richer when costs are already out of control?
82 2019-05-20 23:06:56 If you’re not part of Stocks Rising, don’t hmu about any trainings
83 2019-05-20 23:06:51 I don’t get why people buy stocks anymore, it’s clearly not for long term investing. 

If you believe in the story and you understand the risks associated you shouldn’t freak when the stock goes up or down. 

I guess everyone thinks they’re Gordon Gekko or it’s the Age Immediacy.
84 2019-05-20 23:06:46 Farage should be in “Stocks” in Westminster’s Parliament sq, where we could all cast our vote.
85 2019-05-20 23:06:44 More strawmen. 

If you have a charity to stop killing.
And you have stocks in MTN. 
And MTN literally does killing to increase profits which you then collect.
Do you get personal blame? Yes. 
What if you get tax reductions for the charity to stop killings? Even more so.
86 2019-05-20 23:06:19 Somebody else owns the stocks now. That doesn't preclude them from being sold. It's really simple. If the lenders choose to sell them then they realize the gains. Your argument that they're not liquid assume an *inability* to sell. You're just lying.
87 2019-05-20 23:06:16 Him and all of the other bashers are. They're all over $DLCR and $IDNG which tells me that they are both runners and that they want shares so I buy more. Easy money!
88 2019-05-20 23:06:16 But then maybe that's why I'm not rolling it in, soo... 

Did tried to be real smart and precise on a couple of stocks. They didn't end well.

93 2019-05-20 23:01:13 Finally seeing something in my stocks and trades and it’s pretty exciting!!!
94 2019-05-20 23:00:54 buy a car, stocks, and set up a savings account for my daughter
95 2019-05-20 23:00:38 I too saw that hysterical bogus reporting. Please provide even one factual, vetted, fact checked example of any recognized economist that sold their stocks, reported in a legitimate media outlet.
96 2019-05-20 23:00:32 Totally Agree 100% Charlie!!!! It is not FAIR that these investors make $$$$ off of these stocks, so let´s LEAVE THEM in CONSERVATORSHIP FOREVER!!! We can do a GREAT JOB conserving them!!!! We can EASILY put the company on the GOVT Balance Sheet!!!! Keep it Nationalized!!!!!!!!!!
97 2019-05-20 23:00:21 This month has been rough or China + growth stocks and I'm experiencing a drawdown. 

Despite this DD, my YTD return is still +22% versus +13% for $SPX.

I guess I'll just live with the volatility and periodic drawdowns.
98 2019-05-20 23:00:19 Plot Twist possibility: @elonmusk is selling off his own stocks so he can take Tesla private for cheap!!!
99 2019-05-20 22:59:41 Also when the COI interferes with interpretation of the data. Bias is present in everyone. But everyone has a different burden of bias. Owning stocks, reimbursement, interest in the technique, bias transferred by training, etc. Is a complex spectrum.
100 2019-05-20 22:59:34 When will someone finally look into YOUR Shady Dark Money and Special Interests?  Projecting your Crimes on others is the Classic Democrat Play. Did you receive Money through stocks from Zuckerberg last year around the beginning of April?  Yes or No!  Way to Work ‘The Con’Senator
101 2019-05-20 22:59:15 Invest in stocks.
102 2019-05-20 22:59:04 Good luck. Shoppers Drug Mart not only stocks aisles full of homeopathic nonsense, but they sell Gwyneth Paltrow's magazine. Clearly their commitment to scientifically proven products is not a priority.
103 2019-05-20 22:58:45 How would you feel about being put in stocks and having the soles if your bare feet tickled? 
104 2019-05-20 22:58:15 It's a very difficult situation. Infineon is one of the German companies with the largest China exposure, accounting for about 25% of revenue. Their stocks have already fallen. No one will win in this, at least not in an export oriented country like Germany.
105 2019-05-20 22:57:15 Headline of progress in trade talks may have durable positive effect on other stocks like US high-end consumer goods. China will reduce dependence on US techs, won't be held hostage. You want Tech, buy China Tech. European auto should be good.
106 2019-05-20 22:57:05 This smells more like gaming the stocks via short selling than ever...

110 2019-05-20 22:52:35 Wow... @BoxScoreBrands and @MoviePass are killing my #stocks right now... -$196 and -$173... What can we do to change these around friends??? That's nuts! But I'm in it for the long haul lol $HMNY $BOXS #HMNY #BOXS
111 2019-05-20 22:51:10 Looks more stock than the stocks, but in a better way.
112 2019-05-20 22:50:13 Felt like the market was down more than it actually was. Probably because of all my biotech and Chinese holdings. Biotech and regular tech down a bunch as were Chinese stocks (GXC down 2.7%)....
113 2019-05-20 22:49:45 The single best feature of an Apple Watch is quick access to “Find My iPhone”.

115 2019-05-20 22:47:40 I’m going to keep track with Ukrainian politics, and think about buying Ukrainian stocks as a long term investment. Seriously lol
116 2019-05-20 22:46:47 Interesting, appreciate your perspective. I generally don’t mind monopolistic, in fact I like when my stocks create “competitive moats.” At this price and 100% buy ratings from analysts and accelerating growth it seems compelling.
117 2019-05-20 22:46:20 "Common stocks and uncommon Profits" by Phil Fisher and "Beating the Street" and "One up on Wall Street" by Peter Lynch.

@markminervini book also very good!
118 2019-05-20 22:45:34 Name & shame him including his family, should put a stop to it.

Better still, put him in the stocks and throw crap at him.
119 2019-05-20 22:45:05 WAYFARER COOPERATIVE stocks slump
120 2019-05-20 22:41:36 Like the economists who sold all their stocks the day after the election bc they said the stock market would crash or the economists who predicted Trump would run our economy into the ground, or it would be apocalyptic for Americans to get more money back in their paychecks?
121 2019-05-20 22:41:24 I love how people look at me on the phone and think I'm staring at a blank screen. No bitch im reading about stocks and lookin at tiddies duh
122 2019-05-20 22:39:39 @positive_results18 I'm all in here. Hoping to make the money here to get into other stocks.
123 2019-05-20 22:37:30 So new teachers will be "negatively impacted?" But it's OK since every single congressman will change to a 401K/2% fees per year retirement, go from tax payer socialized insurance to for-profit privatized insurance, and no longer be allowed to invest in stocks while elected 
124 2019-05-20 22:37:24 Good morning y’all!
I started trading small-lot stocks.

125 2019-05-20 22:37:04 Very fluctuating market.. Forex is a risk and considering Pakistan dynamics won't invest in dollar.. Better to invest in property or stocks.

127 2019-05-20 22:36:34 Thank you, glad you find my posts useful. For what it is worth, I also pay attention to valuations before investing.

The valuations of my stocks seem high but that is due to their growth rates/long runways. My two cents...
128 2019-05-20 22:36:24 I’m so broke I had to sell my stocks :’(
129 2019-05-20 22:35:36 To an extent I certainly do agree. Several stocks that look uglier by the day out there but not ugly enough to want to take any big risk on. Been more selective than ever on which stocks I'm going long on.
130 2019-05-20 22:34:26 I AM SOOOOO LOVING MY 401k & MY STOCKS!

138 2019-05-20 22:29:28 $GH with a secondary offering. It will be interesting to see how the stocks handles the dilution. The recent gap could see a fill.
139 2019-05-20 22:27:52 Three of these are tech stocks that at least turn a profit. The other is a cash burning car company.

If you still insist on misleading retail on $TSLA you at least need to put your money where your mouth is.

At what price is your firm buying?
140 2019-05-20 22:27:50 The worse it gets the more I want to buy stocks...
141 2019-05-20 22:27:47 Relax bro. Your stocks will be fine. 

You have no idea what happened. Let your imagination fill in the blank spaces. There may be a good reason behind this. Let's trust the business queen until then.
142 2019-05-20 22:27:45 Stocks have traditionally underperformed when a Stark rules Westeros.
143 2019-05-20 22:27:21 Very few stocks long-term trade higher following a reverse split. In between though, due to the very low share float, expect to see some price spikes on any news as traders take advantage of the low share float.

152 2019-05-20 22:23:26 Investing 101:

Stocks/ Bonds/ ETFs: Gradual growth overtime 

Bitcoin/ crypto: Potential for a very high return in a relatively short period of time. 

Each get riskier. Each has a higher reward. Invest wisely.

164 2019-05-20 22:18:34 Have no idea how SPY kept it together with so many big name stocks imploding. If Apple was up 3% SPY would have been ramped 3% plus

173 2019-05-20 22:07:36 It would be if policies stopped supporting livestock & took climate + biodiversity crises into consideration! Plant milk sales are booming. We need more nuts. There's plenty of wildlife competition with livestock! E.g. badger cull in UK & so much else!
174 2019-05-20 22:07:16 I know. I just find it hilarious that the Fed can’t find any. It needs to get bad enough before they admit there’s rampant inflation...till then we ramp higher in stocks likely due to a rate cut
175 2019-05-20 22:05:57 @Tesla stocks plunged 2.7% $205.36 after steep low as $195.25 its earlier. Tesla stocks has fallen about 38% this year.

179 2019-05-20 22:03:08 I think you are very knowledge and make good decisions. For example $CRM was among few stocks that was in green today and you just invested ! 

Like everyone else, we can’t predict market timing. I follow IBD big picture and they said Market on correction. Hence I am HEDGING
180 2019-05-20 22:02:53 The value of a stock is in its ability to be resold. If you strip 50% of stocks away from people, what are those stocks worth? If you can’t resell them, they’re worthless. Which makes the other 50% worthless as well.
181 2019-05-20 21:59:49 How does james Robert's get a run? I get that nsw stocks at center are a bit depleted, but the guy is out of form, and produced very little last year. I'd be give josh Morris a call up. The guy is in form and never failed to produce for nsw!

252 2019-05-20 21:21:44 Tariff man gets another down day for stocks.  I guess we need to start getting ready for higher prices across most of the economy. We're trying to gauge the impact. Short term its not good for the average family.

258 2019-05-20 21:17:49 30M of FB stocks back then was about 1-1,2B USD. So you missed quite big here.
259 2019-05-20 21:16:28 Re: #USD vs #stocks: theoretically the two move inversely. USD ↑ = stocks ↓. 

Year/year: #SP500 is +4.6% and #USD +8%.

What does that tell you about the current relative strength of the stock market?
260 2019-05-20 21:15:40 $AAPL (Apple Inc.) stocks are down. Bearish it would seem.
261 2019-05-20 21:15:29 No it's typical Lemming "stocks at ATH's are safer" erroneous thinking.

265 2019-05-20 21:14:00 The loser president just cost the market yet another .8% with his trade war, and tech stocks even much larger a percentage than that.  What a friggin jerk this guy is - undermining his own best reason for re-election with this obsessive belief in tariffs. He is a nutjob.

269 2019-05-20 21:11:17 Oh I’m not concerned with the short term bc I’m not fooling around with single stocks. I’m looking to invest long term in index funds, starting with a Roth IRA. I haven’t contributed yet, but I plan to max it out this year and every year.

300 2019-05-20 20:58:57 Was breaking news on German TV this morning. Deutsche Bank going swiftly downhill.  Their stocks plumetted 3.6 % today to the lowest in 46 years. I figure they'll be happy to hand over Trump's financial records without delay now, to save what little is left of their reputation.

308 2019-05-20 20:54:16 My next step against Shuton: take more stocks
309 2019-05-20 20:53:46 I don’t know what that means. Stocks perform well when there’s more certainty than less, when earnings and confidence are growing not contracting and when global growth is also growing, particularly when we have a ton of our cos selling globally and now will see tough sledding

312 2019-05-20 20:50:40 I think we agree. Prudence, care and due-diligence are key. Buying anything at any price could be a recipe for disaster. What if the Financial Crisis had gone a different route? Stocks have intrinsic value. Do advisors know the value of the assets they are buying for clients?

343 2019-05-20 20:27:58 World stocks tank: Europe -1.1%; US -.7%. As prospects for a trade agreement between China & US dimmed, investors continued to price in a possible full-blown trade war.

348 2019-05-20 20:27:21 People UNDERSTAND why they invest in stocks.

They’re purchasing a piece of the company and think the company will grow.

351 2019-05-20 20:26:28 1.) If it keeps happening Wizards should just stop sending out previews, but it's probably not in their best interest to do so.
2. & 3.) It may be unethical, but it's not illegal. It's only illegal in regulated markets (ie stocks.) We're really only talking about pieces of paper.
352 2019-05-20 20:25:23 Exactly.... we used to put people in stocks and throw shit at them...the very basis of democracy!
353 2019-05-20 20:24:33 was pretty interesting that we couldn't catch a bid in treasuries today with stocks selling off.
354 2019-05-20 20:24:22 The punkademics book was what first got me thinking about punk pedagogy. As @Dr_F_Stewart has already said the Punk Pedagogies book the library stocks is a good starting point too. And yes, the symposium too if interested :)

356 2019-05-20 20:24:07 Blockchain technology and BitCoin are two very different things. How is the stock market any less risky? It’s just sophisticated gambling. The only difference right now is higher volatility.  In stocks you’re investing in products, technology, etc... same with blockchain.

359 2019-05-20 20:20:55 Its not the use that bothers me, its the amounts and sell offs they tend to do for their own benefits, tends to hurt common traders in the long run, why I don't even bother with traditional stocks anymore.
360 2019-05-20 20:20:50 Agree but I don't usually trade single stocks - as per my pinned post. I made a $TSLA short nevertheless when it dropped below $245.

373 2019-05-20 20:14:01 Every politician in our 'free country' has the right to his/her point of you, to have eggs, milkshakes and God knows what else thrown on them is shameful and shows the lack of respect and dignity in parts of our society.

375 2019-05-20 20:13:39 In the UK, the multinational stocks have held up the market in the wake of a declining Pound. With trade wars we might just see the reverse in the US, with domestic stocks outperforming those with global markets and global supply chains
376 2019-05-20 20:13:07 So now companies IPO at later stages of their growth, hence the stocks cratered after the IPO.  It just feels like company insiders now selling the falling stocks to the public, unless their current management can pull off another growth curve like Facebook did with mobile

389 2019-05-20 20:08:50 Stocks finish broadly lower, led by techs as China trade worries deepen. Nasdaq ends -1.5%, near session lows.

S&P -0.7%, Dow -0.3%, -84 to 25,679.

Strength in utilities, energy and financials helps offset tech slide. But losers still top winners 2/1 on NYSE and Nasdaq.

503 2019-05-20 19:04:19 When commodities are substituted into a portfolio, it's usually to replace a portion of the bonds, not stocks.  And the primary purpose of bonds is (should be) capital preservation, with a secondary benefit being interest.

505 2019-05-20 19:02:46 Basically, Peter is telling his customers (who he sold gold and gold mining stocks too) "The the world is wrong they just don't know it yet. The world will revert to the system and economy I am comfortable with, Just sit tight while the stock market 4X's and Bitcoin 1000X's."

511 2019-05-20 18:59:25 No, perhaps it isn’t very sophisticated but it’s not going to physically hurt him, just his pride, for which I couldn’t give a rat’s arse. We’ve pelted ‘law-breakers’ with rotten veg and eggs etc for centuries, he should be grateful he wasn’t slapped in the stocks first!
512 2019-05-20 18:58:56 We all deplore lame brained clowns who resort to violence when things don't go their way. 
It may be an idea, as we reform our country, to bring back "The Stocks" for crimes such as this.

542 2019-05-20 18:46:15 Yes - people fed up and you are seeing protest votes.  In stocks when big swings are beginning the markets stop trading.  Maybe in politics we need to switch from informed polls to unsustainable protest polls.  Maybe worth looking at stock algorithms to provide poll health check!

604 2019-05-20 18:14:30 For this cycle, look to more robust credit criteria than pre 07 - if this can be sustained then so will stock earnings yields and a modest economic multiplier - caution possibly is that most stocks will appear undervalued with Treasuries and effective rates set to fall?
605 2019-05-20 18:14:09 I state again, these delightful little people need to spend some time in the stocks on the market square.  Perhaps they feel a little embarrassed by that and not do it again...we can hope.

611 2019-05-20 18:11:11 OK my grand pa teached me to diversify and only do stocks with money you don't need (he was born in 1921, so he saw the crises from the 30's, 2nd world War and the oil crisis in the 70's when he worked at a large bank). I think I get better ROI when investing in myself.
612 2019-05-20 18:10:52 Like it’s millions of dollars in stock that being given away.  And an employee has the option to cash out upon vesting.  So if you give employees 2.5 mil in stocks and they all decide to cash out their vest... the company has to come up with cash?

Thats what I call putting some of your money better to work for you, than in stocks!
626 2019-05-20 18:02:56 That's an unknown risk (FM changing the stocks/being replaced by some other person/leaving the AMC), but why to go for something where the knowns are not in sync, just coz there are giants as holdings which 'presumably' are low risk.
627 2019-05-20 18:02:35 Ford's shares are tanking right now.

644 2019-05-20 17:55:48 It's a proud British tradition, stocks pelting, egging, cabbaging, tomatoeing etc.
645 2019-05-20 17:54:51 That’s only for good companies. Plenty of ‘fearful moments’ in stocks that have gone to zero.
646 2019-05-20 17:54:46 2000 to my mind was much worse.2008 was obscure financial products few owned or understood(CMO's).2000 saw an index drop 85 pct and not recover for 17 years. Stocks considered Blue Chip not dot.coms: MSFT ORCL JDSU Lucent DIED. No Lazarus V shape within the year, accounts to 0.
647 2019-05-20 17:54:46 We aren't accepting incoming stock transfers right now while we're making improvements to our process. We don't have an expected timeframe for when this maintenance will be complete, but we're happy to let you know once you can transfer stocks into Robinhood again.
648 2019-05-20 17:54:44 INTC down 26% since April 23. Thats about 3 weeks. Anyone who thinks SPX can be down 3%, while INTC down 26%, is insane. INTC is one of handful of co's at BACKBONE of US economy. Bond market sees this. Stocks will get rude awakening. CHINA STORY IRRELAVANT, IT IS NOT THE REASON.

650 2019-05-20 17:51:54 The concept of trading #Forex is the same as trading #Stocks. Though forex has the higher amount of liquidity, it’s the riskiest of all investment techniques. You can blow your account in minutes (if you’re not careful).
651 2019-05-20 17:51:34 Lower Dividend Yields:  Some Yields may not be as high as owning a high-yielding stock or group of stocks. The risks associated with owning ETFs are usually lower, but if an investor can take on the risk, then the dividend yields of stocks can be much higher.
652 2019-05-20 17:50:54 1/2 No one is saying AMOMX isn't a mom fund. I was talking about mom transaction costs. The study you cite doesn't fully address that since it includes other factor trades as well. Also, AMOMX holds 447 stocks out of 1000. That broad a portfolio may also impact results.
653 2019-05-20 17:50:23 This would be a wonderful time to bring back the stocks so we can see how he likes it.
654 2019-05-20 17:50:19 Diversification: For some sectors or foreign stocks, investors might be limited to large-cap stocks due to a narrow group of equities in the market index. A lack of exposure to mid and small-cap companies could leave potential growth opportunities out of the reach of investors.
655 2019-05-20 17:49:22 If only I could delete stocks this way
656 2019-05-20 17:49:17 Lol let’s start simple. you are already trading. What is your trading strategy and what industries are you already in? Are you trading for the long term or short term? Are you into high yield stocks that pay out dividends? Do you have any etfs or are they single stocks ?
657 2019-05-20 17:49:03 Diversity: As mentioned in the Volatility, having stocks to offset potential decrease within the ETFs provides diversity.  There are over 600 ETFs currently traded on the exchanges.
658 2019-05-20 17:48:28 Limited Volatility: ETFs is reduced with possessing stock across different companies in a sector.  A single stock may decrease, however, will not decrease the entire ETF. If other stocks are performing at a high level, the stock.

662 2019-05-20 17:47:24 The U.S. and state govs could and do limit, enable, ban, and support all industries, without exception. They can and do modify every private decision, usually passively but with sovereign ultimacy. The U.S. can ban bump stocks, or absinthe, or diminish the fish industry by taxes.

675 2019-05-20 17:42:44 Apple stocks are tumbling. They can kiss their China market goodbye, CCP doesn't need to do anything, the people there will no longer support Apple. The world will likely do this to an extent too. Very bad look for American companies as a whole.

762 2019-05-20 17:08:54 Wish I started doing stocks years ago
763 2019-05-20 17:08:38 Eggs, tomatoes, rotten fruit - there's a long tradition at the stocks, theatre and soap box...very British
764 2019-05-20 17:08:16 I feel it moves ahead of results...Not denies about profit booking... Ii feel there is huge scope in midcaps and smallcap stocks. MFs are also waiting to give good returns...
What say ?
765 2019-05-20 17:08:03 attn groups a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3,c1,c2,c3  Communication stocks doing real well, recommend buying into those, more gains expected today and tomorrow. Forget about the Huawei fallout, tech stocks also look to be good buys.  Stay alert later in the day, retail stocks are pointing up.
766 2019-05-20 17:06:31 Why should we sit and wait for a bank, to tell us what's about to happen in crypto, are they done trading stocks and bonds??? We don't need their opinion. $BTC #bullish
767 2019-05-20 17:05:45 Now you have my brain working on who thought this was a good thing to do in the first place historically. I think it comes probably from lobbing stuff at folks who were in the stocks. The thing is we are in the 21st century now :) Lets not do it at all eh...:)
768 2019-05-20 17:05:37 Commie Corbyn is lucky he wasn't put in the stocks before getting "egged?"
769 2019-05-20 17:05:09 Trumo banning bump stocks, Reagan signing Milford Act, Bush with Patriot Act.

771 2019-05-20 17:03:56 China stocks very weak once again. They are faring much worse than us in the trade war.
772 2019-05-20 17:03:34 I've adopted a stock trading style similar to GoT where I dump all my stocks and wait it out until this trade war ends.
773 2019-05-20 17:02:26 Non mdr c'est juste que sur le pinned tweet de @Loot__Lake c'est marqué "dans la limite des stocks disponible" mdr

782 2019-05-20 16:54:36 Smart contracts are a global game changer. Infrastructure plays like #chainlink & #ethereum are the modern day railway stocks. If you can't see it yet, think of DATA as the modern day GOLD. Railways were needed to transport the gold. Get it now? Carl $btc $eth $link
783 2019-05-20 16:54:29 Somthing needs to get lit, or I am walking for the day ...

786 2019-05-20 16:52:42 @terranovajoe Joe huge fan of your opinions on stocks. But today I thought you were misleading on #tsla bonds because in last 2 weeks raised 2.7Bill with 2% coupon. Plus Soros bought #tsla bonds in March Q & @chamath told he is invested in tsla secured bonds. @elonmusk
787 2019-05-20 16:52:23 I woudnt count on it.They must know themselfs that their personal goals and the goals&efforts of the company dont match up. I think they would leave together though if they do. Our best hope is a sublable, i really hope we get that. We ahgasae should have bought stocks in 2015/16
788 2019-05-20 16:52:23 The only thing standing between many still valuable story stocks and the fate of $APRN is the story coming unglued.
789 2019-05-20 16:52:18 Fishing is pretty well covered by leavers. The decimation of coastal villages, and supporting industries, overfishing by the Spanish, CFP practices leads to wasteful loss of fish stocks.
790 2019-05-20 16:52:07 We had estimates of 1.5 stocks last year and Z18 corn traded down to $3.40 if I remember correctly.

792 2019-05-20 16:51:50 I love how this guy still gets described as a "valuation expert" (yes, I know the article is from last month). He should really be buying and selling "mispriced" stocks
793 2019-05-20 16:51:28 Which other overpriced tech stocks are you referring to?  eg Square, Twitter, Box, Facebook, Microsoft,....?  Thanks
794 2019-05-20 16:51:01 I don't see why $4-4.20 Z isn't fair for the next couple weeks until we see what gets in the ground.     I think people don't understand how the bean stocks continue to weigh heavily on corn.

810 2019-05-20 16:46:23 @Siriusjay maybe let Howard know so he doesn’t keep saying cow farts are the problem.
811 2019-05-20 16:46:18 Grown up tip, investing should not be an emotional/aspirational decision 

Want to save the planet get a bike 

Want to retire, don’t invest in volatile stocks
812 2019-05-20 16:46:00 so I guess bull logic now goes like this: trade war escalates, volatility follows, market demands Dec cut, Fed caves, stocks love it. But unless earnings guidance gets off the mat, it's all multiple expansion, as it's been since Dec. Can we really get back to 20+ p/es of Jan '18?
813 2019-05-20 16:45:55 Stocks are tanking as bad as the #Nats are
814 2019-05-20 16:45:40 I do think the downgrade is kinda late to the party though, but like Bidu stocks in a downtrend tend to stay in one no matter how cheap it looks.  I could have argued GME was cheap at 15 10 8. Doesnt matter

818 2019-05-20 16:43:38 This guy clearly missed everything he was taught in economics haha. His students must be broke af buying into stocks and government bonds. Lmao
819 2019-05-20 16:43:17 I'm enjoying every minute of it, as are my stocks and 401K.
820 2019-05-20 16:43:11 We have a new challenge for schools! Today we've invited 49 local junior schools to take part in our new 30 item challenge between now and the summer holidays when our food stocks plummet. It'll be great to see how this is received!
821 2019-05-20 16:43:08 Think a few hrs spent in "stocks" with a tub of rotten fruit left nearby might be appropriate,
822 2019-05-20 16:43:04 when stocks down and bonds down, better not expect a turnaround day
823 2019-05-20 16:41:14 Did not realise stocks had clickable links on Twirrer.
824 2019-05-20 16:40:22 I think his game is going to up up with quiet a few more stocks
825 2019-05-20 16:39:43 TSLA is not a stock where most of the value resides in near term profits- like most growth stocks, the majority of the value of the co. resides in what happens 10 years out and what multiple you put on that earnings stream. When reality looks different than your excel model, sell
826 2019-05-20 16:38:50 $RRD I gave you guys a tip here... took a starter at $2.77, although it came down to our ideal entry area of $2.67

828 2019-05-20 16:37:53 my ford stocks D:
829 2019-05-20 16:37:43 Huge surge in stocks .  Stock transactions should be banned when country is facing  critical events.

That's what alok's insane mind tells  .
830 2019-05-20 16:36:25 Stocks which are up today 30% are not also weak only. They r not the ones which are any day investment securities#adanigroupstocks#ADAGstocks.
Please don't get carried away in this euphoria.
831 2019-05-20 16:36:12 Somewhat notable that stocks are down while yields are up a bit.  Seems like the first time that's happened in this particular correction.
832 2019-05-20 16:35:03 You’re right, but I think Nigel deserves a bit more than a week in the stocks for his financial transactions.
833 2019-05-20 16:34:55 "Graduated from the blocks now its stocks and bonds"
834 2019-05-20 16:34:07 Helene, its second half of May and we already have Bearish Engulfing Months on:
NDX, SPX, DJIA, RUT, Nikkei.

For me, we've already seen the high of 2019 in stocks. but we probably already saw the low this year too.

its a trader's market.

840 2019-05-20 16:31:57 Indeed. They've been buying lithium stocks lately. Maybe it's a good time to look at Albemarle. I'm getting tired of commodity plays though since there's little to hedge. It's complete supply and demand. Trade war hasn't helped.

842 2019-05-20 16:31:21 Exit polls might be a rise to make a quick buck and take advantage of stock market rise and dumping stocks of politicians and their close associates.  Let's keep fingers crossed on 23rd. Might be on borderline!!!

854 2019-05-20 16:26:36 Midcap rally today is supported by rallies in stocks like RCom, RInfra, RPower, India bulls, Adani Power, PCJ, Vakrangee, DHFL etc., Stocks like Page, Bata, MindTree, Mphasis, Tata Bev, Tata Chemicals, L&T Infotech, Rajesh Exports etc are actually down. So weird.
855 2019-05-20 16:26:14 Let the punishment fit the crime.
Put him in the stocks.
856 2019-05-20 16:26:09 I was hoping that would be the case in Dec! the momos like WDAY, TWLO etc. made new HIs while the so called high div stocks plummeted! This mkt is so broken that those who base their inv on value & fund are getting killed! never seen anything like this even in past 2 bubles!
857 2019-05-20 16:26:02 Valeritas $VLRX performed a 1 for 20 Reverse Split. Shareholders will now hold 1 share of VLRX for every 20 shares previously held. Fractional shares resulting from the split will be dropped. #stock #stocks

859 2019-05-20 16:24:36 Conversely too many people are too slow to fix things (trades, relationships, etc.) that go south. Traders hang on to stocks *hoping* they return to previous highs, but like Cramer says, “once milk goes bad, you dump it.” 
#mondaymindset
860 2019-05-20 16:24:03 Sir do you also look at technicals while looking at stocks??
861 2019-05-20 16:23:22 A China deal is coming.  I work with Chinese business people and when they break a negotiated deal then things appear to dig in just before the dam breaks.

Everyone is saying this is going to be a long drawn out trade war.  Stocks are down from highs with big value buyers happy.
862 2019-05-20 16:22:45 Of course I have stocks! I've invested into many farm produce companies! Gotta finance them apples 
863 2019-05-20 16:22:21 As soon as President Donald J Trump became PRESIDENT stocks shot up! Our Embassy is now in Jerusalem! Blacks Hispanics and Asians are working in record-breaking numbers! No collusion no obstruction of justice! Our God is an Awesome God!
864 2019-05-20 16:21:36 If you are looking for a tried and tested strategy which has beaten the market in the past, try alphabet investing. Stocks beginning with the letter “A” have outperformed stocks beginning with other letters.  It may have the best five year return, but it’s also the most volatile.
865 2019-05-20 16:21:25 Yes, and that's the wasted food which isn't eaten. Then there's the wasted food by those who overeat. If we weren't wasting all this food we wouldn't need the intensity level in agriculture which is causing so many other environmental problems. Plus the NHS would be less strained

869 2019-05-20 16:19:32 The way I see it, the temporary trade war serves no other purpose than keeping stocks in the world's two biggest economies from getting too expensive while I continue to save money.

872 2019-05-20 16:18:56 As an investor, I find it concerning that you guys took the "get woke, go broke" route, so I'm dumping all your stocks before it's too late

878 2019-05-20 16:15:55 Yet you don't seem concerned that unemployment for all people is low, stocks are high, jobs being created, god is being put on high, by the admin, instead of shoved in a closet, babies being protected. Since most abortions are POC seems you would care about exterminating them. Hm

883 2019-05-20 16:14:37 Global stocks went lower today.  Lots of stocks are 5% to 15% lower than a couple of weeks ago.   I’m not saying it’s a bargain today, but it looks like better time to buy than two weeks ago.
884 2019-05-20 16:13:56 The useless oxygen theif who did this needs to be put in the stocks naked, have milkshake thrown over his private parts and left for the wasps. And then put on a diet!

903 2019-05-20 16:07:28 I am long term bullish but upside is limited without  a black Swan event like MGB getting power which will help us buy stocks cheap and get 200%+ upside from lows instead of 20% now. But never mind.

912 2019-05-20 16:04:18 Stock markets were nervous about MGB in UP. They seem to, as per exit polls, turn into paper tiger. If that gets confirmed on 23rd - expect a 20%+ upside on stocks. NIFTY becoming 15K+ by end of year.
913 2019-05-20 16:04:02 I would say yes, but here's where we must let the computer talk to us.  If confidence stumbles badly, a scramble for safety in today's world could send stock price disconnecting from classical relationships.  A bear market in stocks would be the expectations that would fail.

975 2019-05-20 15:40:24 And now they're going swiftly downhill with trouble up to their necks. Their stocks plumetted 3.6 % today to the lowest in 46 years. Good job, Donald.

1015 2019-05-20 15:25:18 Of course, do what the pro say ... IMO, we haven’t seen the market correct itself in a while ... and I think the Trump trade debacle is going to negatively influence the market. Some stocks will be okay. But the message ... the message we will send.

1019 2019-05-20 15:22:36 $VIX still pointing to low volatility and fear. Sell off contained in Semis, tech, and Chinese sensitive stocks. Let’s see how this market unfolds in the next few days.

1020 2019-05-20 15:22:32 Also wouldn’t be surprised with all the tariffs affecting a lot of stocks that people are jumping on an American company causing the price to go up
1021 2019-05-20 15:22:17 Feel like UKIP and Tommy will be sharing in that. It's a nonsense, Corbyn egged, Prezza egged I don't think it translates into crosses in boxes. I don't condone it, it's puerile, but christ, I'd stand in stocks and be shaked all day for 10k votes.

1026 2019-05-20 15:21:34 Now @MorganStanley please tell us what does this fix? Last time it happened economies were rising a bit + debt was fractional and GDP was 2 avg. So, what does it fix? You say stocks - are you sure? What are you really saying?
1027 2019-05-20 15:21:07 Yea, he should stop writing about the most parasitic money vultures, a.k.a hedge funds, who suck all the wealth produced by others and perform no real work. Don't worry about stocks. This US phony economy, built solely on debts, collapses much sooner than they think
1028 2019-05-20 15:20:10 $SPY $QQQ $IWM As investors & traders reprice stocks based on trade war impacts, today feels to me like a realization day of sorts. Lots going on under the hood. Trade war impacts, geopolitical tensions & political shifts. Look for low risk & hedging opportunities.

1036 2019-05-20 15:15:32 I mean, I'm not saying your wrong but every single place that talks about stocks is talking about how crazy it is to see how good Beyond stocks are doing. 

So think it's safe to say it might be a bit special.
1037 2019-05-20 15:15:13 few days back we were in the midst of  an economic slowdown ; and now we are talking about a 12-15% rise from those levels of last week. Anyway all that doesn't matter ; with a manipulated "select stocks only rally " anything can happen.
1038 2019-05-20 15:14:36 It's the modern day equivalent of the stocks and pelting people with rotten fruit. And a very visual way to say "bugger off, you're not wanted here". When the people turn on them, they're done. The fact that it's the ONLY way politicians will listen is the incredibly sad part.
1039 2019-05-20 15:14:34 Will crush you with my stocks and bonds. if it's alone.

1043 2019-05-20 15:12:27 Let's just pause to note that buying an individual stock on margin needn't result in margin calls unless the portfolio *overall* has too much leverage. E.g., one can hold T-Bills inside that very same margin account and ride out the fluctuations on certain stocks.
1044 2019-05-20 15:10:10 Stocks up 33 billion, property enquiries increased, business owners excited, certain people angry.  Thats about it.

1052 2019-05-20 15:07:02 One thing about tweeting on stocks I own is that I feel like a fraud if I don't post when I trade. So I should say I took down my $MKL position by ~5% of my total position today, these were shares I added in December. My assessment of IV went down due to the CatCo/ILS debacles.

1080 2019-05-20 15:00:18 Sure. But when MSPs itself are half heartedly implemented on the ground, you are left with much to wonder about whether some people would tamper with it.
1081 2019-05-20 15:00:08 When stocks drop, think of them as a sale. "Stocks dropped today to the lowest level seen in YEARS!"
1082 2019-05-20 14:59:46 it doesnt exist. real money flow depends on volume and matchmaking stock price. you are refering to the theoretical paper value, but that is NOT the actual amount of money that flew out of the market. having a look at very illiquid stocks you can see this very clear
1083 2019-05-20 14:59:43 Imagine if BNN or FP or WSJ reported the TSX rose 30% yr/yr without mentioning the share of stocks used in the index changed radically to generate that difference with Apple counted 2 times more and Ford 2 times less. That happens every single month with MSM never saying ziltch!

1123 2019-05-20 14:41:30 I was looking for a bit more downside in the airline stocks today after a big $AAL downgrade. $DAL has a major gap window at $52.17. That would be a solid intra-day bounce level if it declined down there today.
1124 2019-05-20 14:41:19 if stocks had any attachment to reality then Subaru wouldn't be down 38% over the past 5 years.

1391 2019-05-20 13:02:37 NAR reports that 80% of home buyers believe their home is a good investment, 44 percent saying it’s better than stocks.
1392 2019-05-20 13:02:27 T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint is moving along as $TMUS has successfully sold many of its assets pursuant to regulatory approval. Wireless stocks are up premarket.  $S $VZ.

1393 2019-05-20 13:02:06 Stocks have corrected 10 to 20% in last couple if months. They have gone up max 10 to 12% today and people are talking as if they have made huge wealth today.
1394 2019-05-20 13:01:54 Yeah, acknowledged that things aren't were they should be. That would anger the investors and stocks would drop, abd then the CEO of Activision couldn't give himself a fat bonus while cutting jobs.
1395 2019-05-20 13:00:52 Conversely, right now, simply holding assets like houses or stocks provide the same benefit to wealthy as in the case of deflationary bitcoin. They can live off small percent gains. But this interrupts the economic uses (rather than monetary) uses of these assets. It's worse.

1427 2019-05-20 12:46:57 Why not stocks?
1428 2019-05-20 12:46:55 But stocks!!!!
1429 2019-05-20 12:46:27 But most of the shortsellers either *are* or are *listening* to the research by $TSLAQ on Twitter, so the $TSLAQ research on Twitter largely controls the behavior of the shortsellers, and the shortsellers do most of the relevant trades of $TSLA stocks.
1430 2019-05-20 12:46:10 We have good stocks and we don't have heavy exposure in them. *Selling some into strength" in choppy markets helps.  #stocks
1431 2019-05-20 12:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 6 stocks Friday including $KSU, $NPTN and  $CC.   Top performer was a same-day gain of -100% in $CC where July 29.0 calls bought for $0.34 closed at $0.00.
1432 2019-05-20 12:44:18 The same is true for investing. If you buy commodities funds that pay no interest or dividends and have no real growth, you have less money for stocks fund that do.

1435 2019-05-20 12:43:30 So $25 for withdrawals and $10 per month if you don’t keep on top of your account logins. Seems quite steep. I mean, you could always just open a straight forward stocks and shares isa with say fidelity and not have to worry about those sorts of caveats.
1436 2019-05-20 12:43:27 All the low lying stocks which did have any basis have been dumped at profits
1437 2019-05-20 12:43:02 You're just totally wrong. Shortsellers have borrowed almost 30% of stocks, sitting at $10 billion if they keep the short position up to $TSLAQ, and they're responsible for over 50% of the trades that actually react to the events relevant to $TSLA: they're the main price setter
1438 2019-05-20 12:42:03 one simple rule to become rich; save money and don't but branded materialistic things instead buy shares of those brands cause their is a depreciation value for things and a profitable value to stocks..... choose wisely....

1441 2019-05-20 12:40:23 In 2007, he was so frustrated because fertilizer stocks kept on climbing as China kept on buying corn and soybeans. They are not doing much these days. The same happened to miners and energy companies. Chinese companies bought a few Canadian oil companies with poor fundamentals.

1453 2019-05-20 12:32:48 Personally I think it’s one thing worth considering. I focus on what my stocks are doing. What the indexes are doing. And what the number of new highs and new lows are doing
1454 2019-05-20 12:32:24 after the last five years of crying wolf, can you blame them for not buying it?

I can't.

And obviously even with a huge loss in production we have adequate ending stocks. I'm not saying we're going to the moon, but the 2.5 bbu c/out is long gone
1455 2019-05-20 12:31:09 That is exactly what I am saying...the stocks they own aren’t globally weighted (active choice), they don’t own bonds weighted by market cap (active choice), they own stocks and bonds in proportion to an algorithm instead of one portfolio levered to desired vol.

1468 2019-05-20 12:22:45 how to buy Tesla Model 3 with 42% discount: 
Buy 100 $TSLA stocks now at 200$ (20k $ value), sell it at 350$ 1-2 years later (35K $ value). That's it!  enjoy your Model 3 for 20K$
1469 2019-05-20 12:22:18 I still believe STOCKS are an effective deterrent.
1470 2019-05-20 12:21:56 Yes the trading stocks wasn’t the best example here. However the beauty is, everyone can generate wealth that way. Even a McDonald’s worker. Look at it from a different angle and you’ll see all the opportunities there are for everyone!
1471 2019-05-20 12:20:26 Shocking, Fox saying what is reflected in the markets.  Jobs and stocks are doing well.  Pay attention versus just blindly Trump hating.  Otherwise, it shows you don't care about the country, you just want to hate.
1472 2019-05-20 12:20:12 if you trade stocks, where does that money/value come from?  does it just appear out of thin air?  no—it’s generated by workers on the lower levels of the companies you’re investing in.  also, it’s hard to believe one person could make an app and sell it for 1B by themselves.

1476 2019-05-20 12:17:52 Great post Barbara. I agree real estate does not look passive. I think I'll take a pass for now. One area I'd 'disagree' on, I think one can hold a basket of high quality stocks and NOT watch them. One can be passive. We have to start with quality and hold 'enough' of em 
1477 2019-05-20 12:16:51 Bad Kitty: it wouldn't. Shortsellers undoubtedly play an important role in finding a fair and sustainable price of a stock, which is below $30 in the case of $TSLAQ. Without them, the cultists would be happily trading at $400. Shortsellers effectively print new stocks...
1478 2019-05-20 12:16:03 Especially when you are top heavy in oil and gold stocks........
1479 2019-05-20 12:14:55 I could create an app and sell it for a billion dollars if it blows up enough. It’s a new era, not everything is labor driven. I could trade stocks and turn it into a billion after awhile without enough skill. There’s multiple things you can do man
1480 2019-05-20 12:14:52 It’s funny that one of the things you think he did wrong was to ban bump stocks.  How about defying the constitution,  obstructing justice.  Separating children from their parents. Giving big business a trillion dollar tax break sending our national dept through the roof.

1500 2019-05-20 12:05:13 Not the first time that few stocks are driving up the index.  Happened many times before. The key point is investing in index funds(or mfs/stocks if you have the skills to pick) & staying the course.

1505 2019-05-20 12:02:28 If you look at the original CAPM paper, market portfolio contains all risky assets and therefore beta is measured against an asset class diversified portfolio. This makes sense, but at some point we have started measuring beta against stocks only, which is not optimal.

1628 2019-05-20 10:47:44 It is excellent news but it will be marred by the fact that the 4 people arrested will get a slap on the wrist and five quid from the poor box instead of being paraded through the town and left in the stocks for 24 hrs and then birched for good measure.

But...us moderates......

1872 2019-05-20 07:30:52 Thankyou, just be sure to let me known if you spot any other stocks with imminent 250% upside 
1873 2019-05-20 07:30:40 There's really no stopping the Chinese at this point. Silicon Valley companies don't even pay tax to stay afloat what happens when the stocks start tumbling? Or the Chinese create an alternative online ecosystem that eats their market share?
1874 2019-05-20 07:29:53 I exited all the stocks in todays rally

There are woefully undervalued stocks on AIM and you have to trust your research
The market can not love them for ages BUT doesn't mean they are unlovable
1876 2019-05-20 07:29:26 Yes @KTHopkins All the #Newspolls suggested #labor left would win with preference from the #Greens ? So great Australians were awake to the left, a win for real people, even stocks approved  bad luck 
1877 2019-05-20 07:29:09 Morning all.. Wall St had a weak close as stocks fell into the last hour with S&P falling o.58% and the NASDAQ down over 1%. In Asia we have seen mixed results with Nikkei up 0.25% but China was down 1.25%.

1879 2019-05-20 07:29:03 Bitcoin is the only undervalued asset at the moment. 

Stocks, bonds and real estate are at all time highs...

You choose.
1880 2019-05-20 07:28:55 Exactly the point. It just seems, that everybody from Promoters to Underwriters of the issue to Early Stage Investors are all colluded to pump the valuation and dump it in the market.
On a very small scale, I see this happening in SME listed stocks. No comparison, indeed!
1881 2019-05-20 07:28:47 Commercial Engineers, FCS Software, ESS DEE Aluminium, Mro-tek Realty, Niyogin Fintech, Arvind Fashion, The Byke Hospitality, IG Petro, Uniply Industries, Eveready Industrie, GPT Infra, JP Power,  Ballapur Industries,  also featured among the stocks that hit upper circuits on BSE

MadCaps & junk PSU stocks greet Modi ji’s second term with a massive rally?
2110 2019-05-20 04:52:27 We DO NOT LOSE EVER AGAIN! Whether in the stocks, oil, or WAR! America support our President and keep God in your hearts!
2111 2019-05-20 04:51:46 And retailers holding (now devalued) stocks of the stated phones must be absolutely livid! I smell a legal class action ;)
2112 2019-05-20 04:51:19 Obviously if people are invested in midcaps stocks without stoploss, they lost opportunity cost of money.
It's not about life highs, its about a price where you entered is correct or not and you are benefited with it. You don't invest in all stocks at top ?
2113 2019-05-20 04:50:57 Sometimes shit doesn’t need to make sense. Just put 20k in your stocks and put 10k in bitcoin and if you bitcoin goes to zero, well you were already willing to loose the money in the first place by Investing.. so it’s fine.

2127 2019-05-20 04:43:19 Indian stock markets started reacting to exit polls results predicting Big win for #NDA . There is a possibility of reversal in trend if verdict on #May23 is not clear. Be cautious. Stick to quality stocks.
2128 2019-05-20 04:41:59 Actually, further to that, I’d imagine it was palpably in the interests of every ‘Shire Tory’ who’s factored in free #NHS healthcare and a stable dividend-paying portfolio of UK stocks into their retirement plan, if not ease of retirement abroad, to stop #Brexit wrecking it all.

2233 2019-05-20 03:41:48 Given that almost no one would have long positions going into the exit polls, chances of a pullback from a higher open are limited. Old trapped buyers would be the sellers in stocks and that is what is likely to produce a pullback, if at all. #NIFTY #Stockmarket

2357 2019-05-20 02:12:50 @APompliano Bitcoin will democratize how our plnanet feels about spending a finite resouce. Will your dollars and shekels be worth more tomorrow?  No. Will your stocks do better tomorrow. Nah. Will we have productive resources @ our disposal in the future? The virus is spreading.

2408 2019-05-20 01:32:15 Private banking can be a great service to clients looking for investment beyond stocks and bonds. It is also rife with money laundering. DB has been caught so often that they should either end PB or go out of business.

2410 2019-05-20 01:28:30 strictly RR - my view stocks maybe 10% up best case 30% down worst case.  Bitcoin 1x down and 5x up over 2 years. you don’t need super hi probability that BTC is in bull cycle to make a BTC allocation if u brlive my expected returns.
2411 2019-05-20 01:28:24 How can we do that with a POTUS who wants to turn our country over to illegal immigrants just to help his business cronies get cheap alien labor to make their stocks prices to rise and American citizens wages to stagnate
2412 2019-05-20 01:27:49 I mean...if after every mass shooting the NRA tells its followers "Theyre coming for you guns!" and then gun stocks always seem to go up due to the fact gun owners stock up on guns and ammo...its probably a safe bet so say they are related

2417 2019-05-20 01:23:01 European stocks fell on Friday as increasingly strident rhetoric from China in its trade fight with the US, combined with the collapse of Brexit negotiations between the British conservative government and Labour opposition, killed investor appetite for risk assets.

2422 2019-05-20 01:21:00 I sure can relate in a different kind of way; lost Millions (stocks) in the melee, but survived it somehow.
Glad you/your family did too; only Life, once lost, can't be regained.
2423 2019-05-20 01:20:55 This has nothing to do with “the moment after a 10 year bull”. This is an overall statement of how investors think and approach investing. Their decisions on how much to put in bonds vs stocks is a risk decision, not “active” one. Rebalance, same thing.
2424 2019-05-20 01:20:53 US stocks fell on Friday as a breakdown in trade talks, sparked by a tougher licensing rules for companies doing business with Chinese telecommunications equipment supplier Huwaei, dented market sentiment.
2425 2019-05-20 01:20:27 Yes but index funds are not as high risk is my pt compared to individual stocks
2426 2019-05-20 01:19:40 Cleaned up my twitter feed just now.  It’s so easy to say something or retweet something that I forget that sometimes it can be too much. My main focus is always going to be on stocks and investing
2427 2019-05-20 01:19:01 Finished till chapter 7. Amazing read. I find myself somewhere in the book. Gone/ going through similar evolution. You’re right that investing success is not about choosing stocks only rather controlling emotions & building right attitude. God bless!
2428 2019-05-20 01:15:44 Also w re to Warren B, he was taking on big risk in building an asset mgmt fund. You can get leverage in raising money and investing in value stocks in a way that individuals cannot.

2448 2019-05-20 00:55:17 But all of these choices imply views that diverge substantively from the fundamental tenets of passive investing. Rebalancing is a less material choice than glidepathing a mostly domestic portfolio of stocks and bonds. But all these choices add up.
2449 2019-05-20 00:55:14 Oh and more gun control than under Obama. Bump stocks gone with no legislative process and insane red flag laws being promoted. The New York liberal is advancing the liberal agenda bigly.

Anyway, you must be getting paid decently to be so persistent on these tickers that are killing it. Maybe there would be more money if you bought some of these stocks when they were low???
2453 2019-05-20 00:50:53 To be fair he gets almost half his stocks by randomly guessing fsmash in tech chases. Far from a strong Roy>Chrom logic.

2476 2019-05-20 00:38:18 Better sell your @HBO stocks before that final episode. Because you know EVERYBODY canceling their subscription when #Got finally ends. It's about to be struggle season for HBO - straight up sad boy hours.
2477 2019-05-20 00:36:25 Looking at the @TheParraEels loses this season to date and it is fairly obvious we have got bashed up the middle. Unfortunately I think it is time we bid farewell to Mannah and Alvaro and overhaul our front row stocks.

So many times where a jab lock near the ledge fsmash

I don't want it to get buffed cuz that might make it dumb but it could definitely use some tweeks

2485 2019-05-20 00:29:52 Telling people that CFD is high risk and probably the WORST form of gambling. The 'traders' that sign up dont own what they buy, they buy your stocks and get a % and if your value drops you charge them accordingly and close them out of the trade. Literally criminal shit.
2486 2019-05-20 00:29:27 Does this mean there will be no more #stocks buy backs?

2493 2019-05-20 00:25:24 Wolf-Man : Unreasonable Stocks
2494 2019-05-20 00:25:20 Core portfolio of good blue chip stocks should never be viewed with a short term perspective.
Unless you need money ,never sell  blue chips  from yr core portfolio that will keep compounding over a long run.
By doing so you r likely to loose discipline of long term investing.
2495 2019-05-20 00:21:21 Paid/salary? Or does this include sale of stocks?
2496 2019-05-20 00:19:35 Don't play the penny stocks.

2501 2019-05-20 00:15:04 First i did say to a degree but here goes.  Pension funds being too heavily invested in stocks to get the right amount of return to keep them viable.
2502 2019-05-20 00:14:01 And with the exit polls results are out! What should an intelligent investor should do?#ExitPoll2019 #stocks #midcap #smallcap

2507 2019-05-20 00:08:22 But make sure you get the actual pieces of gold in your hands not on paper. Gold stocks are valueless hard coin currency made from gold will always have value

2513 2019-05-20 00:06:04 What I see is that gold is a hedge against inflation. You should start buying gold because when the bottom drops out of Trumps economy there's going to be a massive swell in the price of gold. Your stocks will crash and be worthless but gold will always have a value
2514 2019-05-20 00:05:23 Buy stocks with a ten year perspective. Big money is usually made only over long term. If fundamentals change, you can always sell.
