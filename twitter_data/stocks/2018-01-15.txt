36 2018-01-15 23:43:54 Obama policies (if he had any) were to Socialize this country and make us weaker than ever before in the world. Obama did nothing in Iraq, #Potus cleaned it up in less than a year. Stocks are 9,000 pts. high in less than a year under #Trump. We have Tax Reform. Low unemployment.

39 2018-01-15 23:42:49 I’ve started using the StockPile App to play around with penny stocks. I already made $.60 cents in less than 2 weeks.
40 2018-01-15 23:42:17 To be clear I don't care about banning bump stocks.  I think they are stupid.  Of course the same thing can be done using a belt loop so there's that.
41 2018-01-15 23:41:22 Starting my IRA next month, and then stocks the month after. Time to start making money with my money 
42 2018-01-15 23:41:21 Bump stocks should never have been legal.
43 2018-01-15 23:41:08 I'd appreciate that! Once my cars on the road I'll check out the grocers a bit further from home and see what their stocks are like
44 2018-01-15 23:40:42 Bump stocks can basically turn it into a automatic weapon. I dont think the ban is unreasonable.

49 2018-01-15 23:35:35 How would you measure the effectiveness of a ban on bump stocks?
50 2018-01-15 23:35:16 i'm nearly finished reading it and it's one of the most brilliant things i've read in a while. the overarching topic is investing, but before getting into how to pick stocks he covers his model of how to think well, which i found extremely useful and insightful

58 2018-01-15 23:30:36 3/ and the fact he has not been able to get any of his major legislation policies through let alone anything else. The stock market is due to Obama not Rump,and it makes no difference to joe blow who can't afford stocks, healthcare? No idea to busy

Enough time for one more black swan deflation? Perhaps stocks just melt up in USD, while covertly moving to new acct unit(s).

96 2018-01-15 22:58:54 There should be a federal tax for every transaction/transfer in stocks, derivatives, and bonds ($.01/$1.00 mkt value).  It would raise a boatload to fund healthcare and/or education.

106 2018-01-15 22:48:20 and yet people are still poor, looking at losing their healthcare, and struggling to get an education. Who gives a shit about the economy rising or stocks going up when its a small margin of people getting any of the benefits?

112 2018-01-15 22:46:04 Impressive assuming the investor contributed the max TFSA cumulative amount of 57,500, and grew the portfolio to 104,565 for an 82% gain.

118 2018-01-15 22:41:16 Randy,  Yes I agree, that is one point where his lack of trading knowledge shows. Technical analysis is going to be just as big in crypto trading as it is in day trading stocks.... rest of video is solid. He is a very bright guy.
119 2018-01-15 22:41:03 Background checks primarily.  Removal of things like 100 round clips and bump stocks also. My state (Oregon) already has state wide background checks.  I purchased 14 of my 15 guns legally, the other was my grandfather's.  Basically, they are for common sense.

122 2018-01-15 22:39:47 Cut it out you lazy SOB. 80% of all stocks are owned by the rich. A sitting president has very little if anything to do with the stock market More of your damn LIES. Besides, any gains can be here today and gone tomorrow. The last GOP president proved that.

127 2018-01-15 22:34:16 This when corporate profits are at an all time high. Corporations then take your tax dollars to buy back their own stocks to increase dividends and pay executive bonuses. That's much better than educating people, right?
128 2018-01-15 22:34:10 Unfortunately Niel , it is an image commonly used by stock pumpers to promote stocks. Bad connotations
129 2018-01-15 22:32:37 And the media has done a fine job inflating the value of those stocks.
130 2018-01-15 22:31:37 I get that fans need to latch onto players. Part of being a fan of course. But I'm not so sure there's anybody on this roster that Marks wouldn't move for the right offer. Marks and Atkinson have done a great job of building a lot of stocks.
131 2018-01-15 22:31:19 & how many drugs did Pzizer spend hundreds of millions developing that never got FDA approval for that one?

Are we really sure we want to infringe on someones right to shoot down 50 people in a few seconds?
135 2018-01-15 22:29:11 Just my opinion, why would you let someone else pick your stocks. Person may make just about what you do or more or less. It’s one thing if you don’t have time or an understanding but if someone is going to lose your money might as well be you!
136 2018-01-15 22:29:02 You try your best to put stretched tires on Prius V stocks
137 2018-01-15 22:28:16 You may live in a hatred Republic that you created. I live in America where jobs are magically coming back and my stocks are growing.
138 2018-01-15 22:27:50 With 12% rise in 14 days, Nigerian Stocks are world’s best.
I just remembered the day @seunokin host a PDP Man & asked him. "what will be the outcome of #NSE"  after Mr president new year broadcast. He said nothing will be is just a mere statement. @APCUKingdom @PhilipObin
139 2018-01-15 22:27:10 Ya, maximum 3000 stocks each day. $SX should exchange our old stocks to the new stocks that we can trade and we have the possibility to sell a lot of stocks
140 2018-01-15 22:27:02 Stocks are booming!

145 2018-01-15 22:21:12 I just want a best friend that really wanna actually build, when i say build i mean build credit together, invest in stocks together, knows what she wants in 3 to 4 years in life i just want some one i can actually say is worth it at the end of the day
146 2018-01-15 22:20:00 FTSE has broken the previous day's high for 8 days in a row. The run has extended to 9 days only twice in the 1069 sessions since 22 October 2013, most recently on Monday 9 October 2017, 68 trading days ago (when the run lasted for 12 days) #stocks
147 2018-01-15 22:18:30 #Gold stocks looking great in Canadian markets.
148 2018-01-15 22:18:26 nope.. Ten-x is great (The company) and i would love to own stocks in them, but $pay is pointless since they wont deliever on their whitepaper promise..
149 2018-01-15 22:18:10 Yeah I reckon the stocks might still be low going into round 5 but if we’re 2-2 it’ll be a good time to buy.

152 2018-01-15 22:13:59 Starting today im documenting and following strongly 10-15 stocks... based off my criteria and I want to learn them as well as trade them.. Need to follow their behavior maybe a Blog?
153 2018-01-15 22:11:47 The benefits of trading the index as opposed to individual issues is less volatility and less need to monitor earnings announcements. If a 3x leverage etf outperforms then I don't see the advantage of trading individual stocks.
154 2018-01-15 22:11:36 Don't worry mate, after a while you start to miss old swami going after your stocks when he's quiet...
155 2018-01-15 22:10:40 Recycling trickle down economics that failed the first time, stocks are soaring under Obama policies, a wall will keep out undocumented workers who are the backbone of the agricultural industry- Google what happened in AL and GA when they cracked down- Shortsighted and racist.
156 2018-01-15 22:10:26 I love it! Easy to manage through my phone. It also gives great advice on what you are investing in. I highly recommend it if you ever decide to invest money away into stocks. I started with just $5 per stock (5 stocks I purchased) and it's building very nicely.
157 2018-01-15 22:10:22 1/2 Yo, Mr Dennehy, I have an idea about maximising profits and massively increasing chances of success when trading crypto currencies based on an idea that was first implemented by traders in the early 90s when penny stocks were being traded like cryptos are now. It involves
158 2018-01-15 22:09:16 haahahaha. malay mo. balitaan kita. nagtanong na ako sa @SWIMKY_ kung may poster pa kaya sa supplier nila, baka mas stocks pa. hahahaha. 

may this be a lesson. dont be friends with sellers and acting promoters. HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!
159 2018-01-15 22:08:34 Judging by my TRON stocks,I'd say that's a good thing.. :( 
But that's why I love DENT,they are not at all about hype,but all about results! I'm very glad that i hold the most DENT shares of any of my cryptos,I know they have a very bright future and we will blast off soon!
160 2018-01-15 22:08:16 They're not scarce. Because of CFP (imperfect, but better than nothing, and improving), North Sea fish stocks have recovered from virtual collapse caused by decades of over-fishing.

162 2018-01-15 22:07:20 Why do you hate bald guys?
163 2018-01-15 22:06:42 You know why Fish Stocks dont work?

Fish have no arms or legs...
164 2018-01-15 22:06:11 It's a bit man relax
165 2018-01-15 22:05:12 Most Americans can’t afford stocks. That’s a good reason not to buy them.
166 2018-01-15 22:04:22 Nope not at all. @DavidHerro.  Goldberg was huge business that gave the NWO the face it needed to survive. The streak, the crossover appeal, and titles in both major federations make it a no brainer.
167 2018-01-15 22:02:05 Btw: Germany was open the whole day , so I guess it's the issue that SX did not the exchange with the old stocks to the new stocks.... That's kind of reducing the floating and everybody knows what will happen now...
168 2018-01-15 22:01:25 throwing peanuts to workers, corporations are laying off using tax benefits to buy back stocks; lies will be your legacy sir!
169 2018-01-15 22:01:23 A reverse split is a bush league strategy--scam penny stocks do that all the time. #DFSCoin can and should burn a sizeable portion of the Total Supply (30-40%) to increase demand, not perpetrate a RS to screw over current coin holders.

172 2018-01-15 22:00:32 Which questionable stocks might they be?
173 2018-01-15 22:00:18 Silly people.  Bump stocks don't really do anything except make your firearm less accurate.  I can fire a regular semiauto firearm quicker and more accurately than one fitted with a bump stock...
174 2018-01-15 22:00:10 Professional stock trader , I trade mostly MJ/CANNABIS stocks and believe that sector OPPORTUNITY is huge. I do stock alerts from time to time and they run big.

181 2018-01-15 21:56:42 Why stocks over hard commodities or gold
182 2018-01-15 21:56:00 Really because I worked in the industry.  What’s your background?
183 2018-01-15 21:55:50 The Chinese are getting DRC infrastructure work done quickly and efficiently as usual (even in the wet season), to the absolute benefit of #ASX mining stocks such as $AVZ and #4CE #lithium  Shareholder faith is being rewarded despite the trolls and downrampers

185 2018-01-15 21:54:24 yes, mate, you are right and since then continuing to convince the world of #MTR greatness before it failing(I agree Bots has changed somewhat)

now keeping the pretense going on a number of highly questionable stocks enabling the charlatans to rip off unsophisticated punters
186 2018-01-15 21:52:42 Gravy stocks running low?
187 2018-01-15 21:51:29 Taking everything into account, this may be the worst tweet I’ve ever received
188 2018-01-15 21:49:54 I can see multiple stock companies pulling from stocks and buy cryptocoins. It's hard to overlook the 10k+ percent gains.
189 2018-01-15 21:49:22 It’s why you are not qualified to discuss the Wrestling business.  Key word......business
190 2018-01-15 21:49:10 mdr ces connards ils en ont genre 50 en stocks c'est des ptn de dieux vivants
191 2018-01-15 21:48:44 In fairness, what is @SharePickers meant to say? Most of the weekend podcasts discuss controlling risk, scaling into positions, limiting exposure to stocks & de-risking when opportunity arises.
192 2018-01-15 21:47:59 Im sorry man, didnt understand half of what you wrote, so cryptos are too young and its future is speculative humm? Why do people buy stocks if not for speculative reasons? In crypto you can transfer coins or token without middleman from point a to point b, thats not speculation!
193 2018-01-15 21:44:40 And what did the @VCDL say in testimony immediately following hers? “Bump stocks are fun!” We’re done, @NRA and fellow extremists. #ExpectUs
194 2018-01-15 21:43:42 You are a troll here my friend . The data shows steady growth and stocks up unempl down . Don't be cute . Be a man
195 2018-01-15 21:42:44 You’re also grouping apples & oranges by saying both Gold & Bitcoin are “scams”.... look in history book & or today... #Gold is real, tangible, actual storage of value/wealth, a commodity, real $... where’s the scam?! #USD & most #Stocks more likely a scam based on your criteria.
196 2018-01-15 21:41:57 My mindset toward life continually changes. We won’t keep our worldly possessions when we die. Invest not just in stocks and mutual funds but more importantly in the community of people around you.
197 2018-01-15 21:41:09 Wrong. Shorting stocks DOES make them fall as it effectively increases the number of stocks in circulation and soaks up demand without buyers having to buy the real stock. This in turn impairs a company's capacity to borrow.
198 2018-01-15 21:40:10 ugh right?? i just want the beautiful clear skin that i deserve. i'm gonna find somewhere that stocks the ordinary! they're cruelty free!
199 2018-01-15 21:39:24 Does it mean the stock will appreciate for the day when market opens ? Where to check pre market stocks ? Thks .
200 2018-01-15 21:38:48 @Gabriel_Groma curiosidades:

- A corretora precisa ser Canadense?
Obrigado!
201 2018-01-15 21:38:35 I was talking about what happened, not what could have happened. But thanks for 'splaining how stocks work to an investor.
202 2018-01-15 21:37:52 Thanks mate glad you enjoyed. Hope we can buddy.
203 2018-01-15 21:37:41 3/ stocks because they are “fun,” and the paid NRA lobbyist saying they oppose a bumpstock ban. We’re paying attention. #BlueWave #ExpectUs
204 2018-01-15 21:36:27 Bart, what the heck are you saying. What stocks do I pump and yes I have been taught by myself. Paid guru's are a waste of time when there is so much free material online
205 2018-01-15 21:36:21 Ouch - screening was excellent. Need to get it national
206 2018-01-15 21:33:59 I hope you are not taught ugly habits by some. Don't tout bad stocks just to make money for yourself leaving others holding the bag. Please have some class. Best to you
207 2018-01-15 21:33:54 How does one "get out of the USD" most easily?  If i had a lot of money in USD & wanted to "get out fast", know what I'd do?  Buy US, EU, & EM stocks, regardless of valuation

210 2018-01-15 21:32:52 Trump is not looking forward to clean power, because he is backed by big oil, and he has stocks in Putin’s oil field over in Russia. Trump is out for Trump and family not you not me. Sanctions on Russia keep Putin from drilling the whole 600 acres.
211 2018-01-15 21:32:08 Agreed, no need to have thousands of coins. Although tokens are usually used as stocks instead of coins, and because of blockchain they can be used as money as well. Market decides...
212 2018-01-15 21:31:45 These investment apps are legit simple ways to get involved in stocks without the headache of extensive research.
213 2018-01-15 21:31:40 I wouldnt be surprised it has soo much potential and with Mr.Baillie as a new director we can see more opportunities in the private/government sector
214 2018-01-15 21:30:40 But there are corrections in crypto just take a look at $BTC and other like $XVG $TRX the only difference in crypto theres a lot of information when they are on the highs or on the lows does anybody in stocks tell you when your in the highs or on the lows?
215 2018-01-15 21:30:33 Long term fundamental in Stocks is firms making profit. LT on Real Estate is end user ability to make payment. Shorter term it's function of lots of high roller cash looking for outlets & to some extent greater fool theory if fundamentals don't pan out. Stocks much easier to exit
216 2018-01-15 21:29:29 Many employees are allowed to buy stocks in the company they work for.  If you earn a bonus, you should be paid one, but not because you ask for one.  Across the board bonuses are nice, especially at Christmas. No one forces you to work there though.
217 2018-01-15 21:29:15 Stocks wants you to go to his channel and say hello
218 2018-01-15 21:26:26 As anticipated- #XVG is heading down to 0.08cents.

219 2018-01-15 21:26:04 Frederica should also boycott success, optimism, security, great stocks, and living in a true Republic.  These are all things President Trump has brought back to America.  She wants to boycott our President, she can boycott America and its greatness.

Dean Heller is a liar and thief
Bump Stocks remember them from October 2nd
Where is the Congresional review?
Dean Heller sold out to NRA
NRA has links to Russian money
Ban sales of Bump Stocks

The kind used on October 2

221 2018-01-15 21:25:11 MLK was not an economist to understand that Govt deficits = Private Sector Savings for the top 5% of the population. Who will take those $s and go speculate in non productive assets like stocks bonds etc... #PUREMMT
222 2018-01-15 21:23:52 Nice to hear from you. Sorry, but I don't follow Canadian stocks.
223 2018-01-15 21:23:35 Looking at shorting alcohol stocks as the rise of Marijuana becomes imminently clear. I'll skip Constellation as they already had the foresight with $WEED.
224 2018-01-15 21:22:31 Stocks are inherently risk based, so that’s not strictly true. If stockholders were facing a strong upward trend, they’d soon reap the profits; therefore it follows that they also shoulder the losses.
225 2018-01-15 21:22:02 Fab - great exercise, I’ll be giving it a go in practice - thanks

227 2018-01-15 21:20:28 Once investors figure out that fiat currency defenders will have to give way to #crypto currency, there will be a rush to the exits for the stock market. The money into crypto currency, causing stock market crash. The choice is simple :  make 5% a month - stocks; 5% a day crypto

230 2018-01-15 21:20:01 When? Look at my bio on Twitter, this channel is for stocks I hold. Do yourself a favour, if it confuses you, stop listening and get a financial advisor to help you.
231 2018-01-15 21:18:16 Also - this talent said to me at a show just over a year ago 'I'm not one of those people who charges for photos' - I know your stocks risen in the past year or so but you don't really need to be a cunt.

And that's coming from me!
232 2018-01-15 21:18:10 Nice TA
233 2018-01-15 21:17:42 Yep drones are the future why use humans lol

235 2018-01-15 21:16:56 I suggest you do your "so called" research more accurately US stocks are going through the roof and employment is at a 17yr high.
236 2018-01-15 21:16:40 Yup, the rich got richer. The average American doesn't own stocks, but how would #DumbDumbDonny know.  He's part of the 1%.
237 2018-01-15 21:16:16 Yep good things come to those who wait. 2018 2019 will be $uav year just give it time they have first movers advantage on a full uav service company. Heck with vblos they can even start partnering with drone delivery near term
238 2018-01-15 21:16:09 kind of surprised the news didn't bring more of a hike this morning...it could be shaping up for a great rebound but hard to tell. a lot more interest in lithium and weed stocks still...
239 2018-01-15 21:15:48 The reason were seeing such high returns is because unlike stocks, crypto currencies aren't tied to any actual number amounts. We pretty much decide what pumps and what dumps.
240 2018-01-15 21:14:54 Searching for Lithium stocks. I own about 7 or 8 small lithium stocks
241 2018-01-15 21:14:37 Who cares about stocks when we have cryptocurrency, stocks cant emulate crypto profits!
242 2018-01-15 21:13:25 Personal pension savings perhaps but pension funds are invested in stocks and the FTSE is well above 2007 level.
243 2018-01-15 21:12:38 If you got any sort of gambling problem in stocks and you are playing cryptos, congratulations there goes your life
244 2018-01-15 21:08:51 Again im not getting in the crypto madness because i can’t sit in cash 1, 2 im not trying be on my phone 24/7, 3 making good money in stocks, and 4 im on winter break so im hanging with homies everyday

269 2018-01-15 20:48:41 Trading #Crypto is not like trading normal stocks. You have to not only accept seeing a chart down 20-30%+, but also size in and take it as an opportunity. If you are getting cold sweats looking at your portfolio, you are over committed financially in #Crypto. Learn and adapt.

271 2018-01-15 20:48:16 Pinching gives you more flowers, slightly later. So don’t pinch anything which only gives one bloom e.g. some stocks & single sunflowers. But anything cut & come again should be ok. I do similar to @flowerpotpolly below #britishflowers
272 2018-01-15 20:47:56 @fmaddenNBA do the Bucks have a GM? Just curious since we never hear from him.  All this discussion on Kidd you think it would bring him out of his hole in the ground?
273 2018-01-15 20:46:12 Hard to separate the two as well. The best performing stocks on Wall St are tech companies.
274 2018-01-15 20:43:09 Its 2008. The financial crisis is still in affect. Stocks have plummeted, banks have failed, your parents have been layed off. You're eating steak-ums again tonight. You flip to Disney channel to see if suite life of Zack & Cody is on. Instead its suite life on deck. Life sucks.

276 2018-01-15 20:41:47 Ravi G, I am learning fundamental Analysis. I just compared Grauer with peer stocks. What I noticed, Trading nearly 5× book value and P/E almost peer TOP. When I compare this, I found Polyplux Corporation  which is trading less than BOOK VALUE and P/E LOW compare peer stocks
277 2018-01-15 20:41:46 Canadian marijuana stocks got smoked today...

good one, right? can i get an attaboy?
278 2018-01-15 20:41:24 Now 2018 and you give evidence from 2013. Saying bots were used to artificially increase the price. Your argument is so weak. You realize high frequency trading dominates all stocks and bonds in the United States. But does that mean that stocks have no value or purpose?
279 2018-01-15 20:41:16 from fundamentals point of view, stocks are still high, unless there is something wrong: bad data or "crude quality"
280 2018-01-15 20:41:13 Is this exit time from equity
281 2018-01-15 20:40:18 Sparky:  "Iain, I don't want to scare you..."
Me:  "But..."
Sparky:  "We've no cheese left.  I will need to bravely venture forth to the shops to replenish our stocks!  What?"
Me:  "Did you say 'replenish'?  And if you're going, get me a Twirl..."
Heh.
282 2018-01-15 20:39:11 You watch way to much Faux News. Hahaha 

80% of stocks are owned by the top 20% of wealth. Not really helping out the middle class. 

Walmart just laid off 11,000 workers. 

Trump is always golfing, not working, but you really don’t care....
283 2018-01-15 20:38:38 yeah but how do I get my shares back, what happened to Crypto stocks?
284 2018-01-15 20:38:20 Personal idiosyncrasies aside, fascial compartments well adapted in those who have been doing it for years, most riders start young. So it then becomes Bio energetic/substrate issue strength of which is an influencing factor.

288 2018-01-15 20:35:47 Senator Dean Heller took $9,900 in campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association. Bump stocks legal in Nevada turning semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic weapons. How do the victims of the Mandalay Bay shooting view Heller now?

309 2018-01-15 20:18:23 Nothing will be done because @realDonaldTrump doesn’t want he & his 1% to see big pharma stocks plummet, like McKesson.
310 2018-01-15 20:17:17 Tax cuts upgraded shareholders' position from 65% stake to 79%.

Thus, stocks are worth 22% more today, separately from actual growth in company value.

This is why the market is up.
311 2018-01-15 20:16:57 One of my favorite moments playing this weekend was in my set vs switch in g2 when I was down 2 stocks to 1, as I was sitting on angel platform I said out loud "ok, time to fuck him up" and ended up 0-deathing him. I was so surprised it actually worked, lol
312 2018-01-15 20:16:24 They don't care about any of those things because they don't have a job, they don't want a job, and they don't own stocks. All they all are free cell phones and food stamp cards and those assets are on the decline so I would be butthurt too I guess!
313 2018-01-15 20:16:07 BUYING STOCKS IN MARCH
314 2018-01-15 20:16:07 Its all relative when payment is in stocks don't you think. Value holds if companies stay healthy and grow, price paid declines when purchasing companies stock declines. Market dictates actual cost of acquisition.

324 2018-01-15 20:05:28 Well, you continue to brutalize the language and perpetuate the fact that you really, have no idea what you are talking about. It’s VERY DOUBTFUL companies would pay dividends on stocks which would LOWER THE VALUE OF SAID STOCKS EVEN LOWER THAN YOU CLAIM, REDUCING COMPANY WORTH.
325 2018-01-15 20:04:21 EVERYTHING IS liked by stocks.

328 2018-01-15 20:03:14 @realDonaldTrump is that all the Trumps CARES about,how much their stocks have gone up! He doesn't give a damn that most of his supporters  are poor and don't have any stocks.
329 2018-01-15 20:02:56 My investment strategy with Cryptos is similar to stocks/shares. Warren Buffet style. My game is long , ideally 5 to 7 years. I am only inbesting in cryptos that actually serve a purpose and has good tech

337 2018-01-15 19:58:31 yea..for the stocks i tend to just go small and one 1 tranche only in a consolidating bargain zone that offers big reward..and i just diversify those plays.
338 2018-01-15 19:58:21 Buy great stocks and forget!!
339 2018-01-15 19:58:10 Probably all of them, even unknowingly. I'm sure all of them have pensions, trust funds, or other investment vehicles, even if they are "blind". Since defense sector has been very strong, with Boeing and Lockheed being among the top stocks of 2017, they probably own some shares.

342 2018-01-15 19:57:18 "Shares can go up as well as down" warnings are to be seen at every step of investing in stocks. In any trade there is a seller who thinks the price will go down and a buyer who thinks it will go up. Both can't win so if someone reads it wrong the name they knew the risks
343 2018-01-15 19:56:28 Stocks are based on an asset on the backend there is an intrinsic value there, there isn’t any in bitcoin

345 2018-01-15 19:53:36 When stocks for a portfolio are picked using chance they often fare better than stocks selected by financial experts. Maybe Trump is hoping this strategy will work with a lot of his decisions?

It won’t be straight, so I’m willing to hedge w/ short $EUR or other plays to keep me in it through gyrations.
348 2018-01-15 19:49:57 That’s sick. I should have gotten in earlier, buying that much now is too risky probably. Fortunately blue chip stocks and such will be around for a long time. I’m looking 40 yrs down the road

353 2018-01-15 19:46:41 Very true, I think Rowland would be a very solid choice but admittedly unlikely. All this (you would think) depends on whether Ricciardo signs a new deal or not, so I guess we will wait and see how various drivers' stocks rise and fall.

359 2018-01-15 19:44:01 A tax cut does not make a store more profitable, therefore it could not have "saved" those jobs. Guess who owns SAMS club? Middle class Americans with stocks and 401Ks. As a shareholder, you want them to make money, and you want them to close unprofitable stores.

409 2018-01-15 19:02:48 This analysis probably true on a 5-10 year time horizon but is looking over the chasm right now. Ditto with EM stocks. China has a giant ponzi finance bubble and needs to have their financial wipe-out / shake-up first.

412 2018-01-15 19:00:36 As the dollar weakens, investors should increase their exposure to international securities, especially those with no exposure to foreign-based firms at all. International equities will outperform the U.S. over the next several years. Target Europe and Asia. $USD #stocks

415 2018-01-15 18:59:36 probably because it's not high enough to deter ppl from buying property :P also the value is relatively stable - imagine if there was a tax on the amount of wealth you had in stocks, it'd be all over the place and planning a state budget would be impossible!

419 2018-01-15 18:55:39 Currency values are blamed/credited/justified on an endless list of factors, but the most important is the quantity of a currency in circulation.  The rise in gold, stocks, bond yields, and growth signal a resurgence in US money velocity.  No wonder the dollar is weaker.
420 2018-01-15 18:54:04 I don’t care about bump stocks.

424 2018-01-15 18:50:53 I have already made my comment to the ATF.  I understand the fact that what the ATF is doing doesn't just affect bump stocks.  It affects all Semi-automatic firearms. Wake the hell up people and read and think.
425 2018-01-15 18:50:41 This will come crashing down on him if the investigation are allowed to continue fully. It will close a dark chapter in the USA. Good times will follow. Buy stocks.

435 2018-01-15 18:41:06 There used to be a time market will correct 5 to 10% and good stocks go up after correction and froth filters out. Now nothing so fund managers dont have any option. Govt also likes this. Hope 2008 does not return.

458 2018-01-15 18:29:17 In the shorter-term stocks may go up because of greed, but that can only carry one so far. In the long-term they go up because they are nominal assets and the economy has grown while the value of money has fallen.

465 2018-01-15 18:23:04 That is a nice strategy indeed. But you have to see that some people who are young/new (stocks too), sometimes are scared of this volatility… For HODL you first need to understand that daytrading is not always a better variant. Unless you’re a pro, what a noob is not.

528 2018-01-15 17:46:14 Or, to put it another way: If you can’t afford to put aside a small proportion of each paycheck, then you probably shouldn’t be investing in stocks in the first place.
529 2018-01-15 17:46:06 This is pretty much an accurate representation of Rookie Street Stocks. There would be cars in the turn one condos if the game didn’t reset you to pit road when you go on the other side of the fence haha
530 2018-01-15 17:42:22 Lol nah man. Only the insecure would take this post as negative. Its the same as buying stocks in companies. Buy into a bad company and you lose. Buy into a good one and you win. I don’t have a half a mil but Im sitting nicely, yes. I’d research blockchain tech before anything.

533 2018-01-15 17:40:29 We have to realize the left's end game is banning all guns. We would end up giving up bump stocks without giving anything in return. No compromise. "Shall not be infringed"

536 2018-01-15 17:39:36 It doesn't matter that we care. I don't care about them either, but that does not give anyone the right to ban them. And any ban on bump stocks would be the gateway to banning any "rate increasing" device like triggers or even semi autos down the line.
537 2018-01-15 17:38:52 How can we compare this rally to history when we have the POTUS now pumping stocks every single day on Twitter?
538 2018-01-15 17:38:18 Just shut up! You're enabling worst president in US history, sexual predator, philanderer, narcissist. You're as bad as he is if not worse. & what about layoffs @ Walmart, Carrier, AT&T, Mepco etc. etc. But it's OK, you & your 0.1% friends are making $$$ in overinflated stocks
539 2018-01-15 17:38:12 It will cost them $700M when they had $14B in revenue last year.  That tax cut that @POTUS gave them is allowing them to buy-back $20B in stocks. Guess who that helps.  As if it couldn't get worse, they are cutting costs by eliminating Sam's Clubs. Keep at it though, Fredo Gekko.
540 2018-01-15 17:38:01 Stocks crossed the $30 trillion marker Friday for the first time, and some traders worry the market may be running too quickly. Any thoughts?

542 2018-01-15 17:36:03 One thing is getting obvious mkt or even stocks has rised to such level and intensity that after 2-3% correction, pain & fear becomes visible starkly.

10% correction is narrated as amplified correction & worst case scenario. And that's when 15-20-25% correction strikes. 
543 2018-01-15 17:35:50 Yeah, I'll do stocks if this market dies out.
544 2018-01-15 17:35:20 Nice charts man I am also watching some of those names. Oil really is on a killer run, keep an eye on some of those energy names if you play stocks

548 2018-01-15 17:32:59 My question is - if $YM_F is +131, by asia session, where will #Nikkei 225 be? *Right now $NKD_F is -140... I would think this spread tightens. Trend has been for stocks to rise, thinking if #Yen $JPY takes a breather, #Nikkei heads towards the green. Otherwise Dow might come in.

Des fois on aimerait juste les jeter
651 2018-01-15 16:34:59 Sir I eager to know about such stocks from you. Hopefully soon
652 2018-01-15 16:34:30 In any market bearish or bullish there are many opportunities to pick up few individual stocks/focused funds which will beat market and create wealth for you....just take decision and action as soon as you spot them and make a meaningful allocation
653 2018-01-15 16:33:39 Oh.  So you are the rich base.  The one who has stocks!  

Most people in these country don't have stocks.  Crow all you like but it doesn't do a thing for most people.
654 2018-01-15 16:32:49 Typical low IQ imbecile, having too much faith and 'vision' about something you have no control over. Vision  didn't save the ass of thousands of 'investors' in shitcoins and shit stocks.

658 2018-01-15 16:31:20 Yes. 

I'd still be out of stocks by now.
659 2018-01-15 16:31:17 In a previous poll 59% of voters believed that #Bitcoin will be obsolete in the next 10 - 20 Years. Which coin will take it's 'Throne' and become 'Top coin'?

665 2018-01-15 16:29:34 yes that is the heart of the model markets do not lead, the economy and profit margins lead. the Wall Street BS that they are smarter than the economy and price stocks in anticipation of economic turns is just that BS.

668 2018-01-15 16:27:57 Buy stocks cheap so that Yanks can chase them higher tomorrow.  Same old game.  Y'all still celebrating football and all?
669 2018-01-15 16:27:17 Stocks have a lot to do with main street. Much of the middle class own stocks through retirement accounts and pensions. Trump has been in office less than 1 year and the changes implemented are positive  for business. Ocare and over regulation were huge impediments to growth.
670 2018-01-15 16:27:00 You Canucks trading stocks today, thanks for shooting those charts over.  Here's it's a national holiday (MLK) and state holiday ( #SkolVikings )
671 2018-01-15 16:26:54 sadly the one thing i have learned how to do the last few years learning to trade stocks/options  is stomach a 1k loss :-/
672 2018-01-15 16:24:42 A) your child scammed you, like parent like child...
B) you can only order things that have previously been in your order history...
C) you must confirm orders...
D) im assuming you're trying to tank @amazon stocks, so you can make a few bucks by buying them up cheap tomorrow?

675 2018-01-15 16:23:15 Well I would consider “DT is doing nothing” as laying blame. But, I’m no Language Arts professor. 

The market will correct here, and I do think that market sentiment is overexcited. But, DT is not to blame for overvalued stocks. Corporate tax cuts will fuel stock valuation...
676 2018-01-15 16:22:43 Can anyone advise me if it's possible, as a UK Citizen, to invest in  Canadian or U.S marijuana stocks? Can't find any of the companies listed on UK broker sites, probably due to legal implications.
677 2018-01-15 16:22:28 Wow!  Too bad that I'm middle class and can't afford to buy stocks!
678 2018-01-15 16:21:45 I day traded stocks for a while. Got a paper record mailed for every single trade from both companies. Tax man only wanted to see final number for profit/loss at year end.

684 2018-01-15 16:18:07 The number of experts cautioning against an overheated market is increasing by the day.

It is best to stay in turnaround stocks that have limited downside. Such stocks can outperform in  both bull and bear markets.
685 2018-01-15 16:17:51 Dow Futures Near 26k As US Stocks Reach Most-Overbought In Over 120 Year

Because of holiday
686 2018-01-15 16:16:52 It's Martin Luther King Day in the U.S. so their markets are closed. If you are thinking of trading Canadian stocks today, don't. On U.S. holidays, Canadian liquidity drys up. Not good to trade in Canada on U.S. holidays unless you absolute must.

705 2018-01-15 16:02:30 Major indexes higher over the past week, technical indicators suggest overbought at current levels. Traders watch economic indicators, industrial production on Jan. 17, jobless claims Jan. 18, consumer sentiment Jan. 19. Markets will view geopolitical events that may move stocks.
706 2018-01-15 16:01:53 Do you think the 80 plus percent of Americans who can’t afford stocks care.  Try being the leader of the entire country. Or is that beneath you.

770 2018-01-15 15:18:46 I think you run the risk of trying to group together many investors on social media interested in similar stocks as if they were some sort of agenda ridden concert party. I am a freethinking solo investor and nothing more.

906 2018-01-15 13:54:09 The fish stocks in my local river Arrow have been decimated by otter predation. Otters will take advantage of any food source large or small.

928 2018-01-15 13:30:24 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you’ll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them—but that’s why they’re cheap! The most common comment I get is ‘Don’t you read the paper?’ Because if you read the paper, there’s no way you’d buy these stocks.

936 2018-01-15 13:24:25 Indian stocks are not a multi-decade story, simply because India as it is, may not last into 2030. It would be wise long-term to cash out in gold or other non-sovereign stores of value. Invest in getting your children a foreign passport (via education).

1032 2018-01-15 12:12:13 Yasss of course take a professionals’ help. Stocks are a gamble but when it goes up, it goes up well. 
Bonds ki maturity is slow relatively but aapke paise aik jaga hai so issa good.
I prefer saving without investing anywhere as such. But profit obviously karna chaiyee
1033 2018-01-15 12:12:04 best one i’ve seen was that the government used factories to make clouds, apparently to control stocks and make money off bad weather lool
1034 2018-01-15 12:11:18 Trumps a germ a phoebe more like don’t tell ppl I can’t touch you your nasty
1035 2018-01-15 12:09:42 true true. i wanted smth with quicker results tho. that’s why i was asking bout stocks :p but i should probably consult a professional before tweeting bout it
1036 2018-01-15 12:07:54 Lies. Who will you blame when the bubble breaks and stocks crash? It better be yourself. PS, the stock market is not the economy. Now stop promoting #fakenews #FoxNews and get back to your outhouse.

1038 2018-01-15 12:07:16 Ipasok nyo sa lang sa mutual fund stocks ang company nyo para sa mga investors. Limit na lang ang share na pwedeng bilhin to protect against ownerships na may personal interest.
1039 2018-01-15 12:06:08 pas grand chose, mais ça peut camper, tanker en jouant safe, et achever facilement les stocks (fair, Uthrow, Usmash), et start des team combo faciles avec le Nair par ex, mais pas vraiment follow up à la reaction vu son slow DJ. Sinon j'ai un mario et un fox qui tiennent la route
1040 2018-01-15 12:02:32 I don't see how it's much different from someone investing in an ISA or some form of fund dealing in stocks n shares? The real issue here is what those CEOs etc were doing knowing the business was in trouble.
1041 2018-01-15 12:02:11 Put it in a savings account first. Don’t invest in stocks yet. 
If you want, buy bonds instead. 
Or if you can get more funding or savings, get a plot

1075 2018-01-15 11:26:25 Before the Warrant Exercise buying common stocks from a new stock offering is not viable for new investors because their investment are going to be dilute by 79.99% after the government warrant exercise.

Merci et jolie journée, en vérité !

1080 2018-01-15 11:22:00 Lol. It's not just about PDRs. Read the whole resolution. When you need to seek approval from the PDR issuers, then that simply means you are giving some form of control. The constitution is clear - 100% Filipino, 0% foreign and that goes beyond stocks and ownership.
1081 2018-01-15 11:21:49 Dahil may recommendation from you, bibili na ko hahaha! Sana may stocks 
1082 2018-01-15 11:21:33 That’s bullshit, because your stocks would have grown over 200-400% after bush crashed it, so don’t tell stories or lies. Any declines would have been in the bush administration. Trump’s “rally” hasn’t achieved Obama’s  rate of growth. You people are so desperate. But, yeah...
1083 2018-01-15 11:20:39 A lot of your discomfort while trading comes from your ignorance about how the market moves. It took me 2.5 years while reading 7 books to figure things out. There's no magic to it you just have to keep coming back til you see it. #Trading #Forex #Stocks

1095 2018-01-15 11:09:36 Stocks are the bomb! Never seen anything move like em. However, they lack liquidity so I end up dealing with indicies to overcome that problem. Forex has god given liquidity but too event driven. Big trends are rare.  barely get my full line in. #Trading #Forex #Stocks

1097 2018-01-15 11:08:29 ★is the stock market too hot? ★
2017 return on S&P 500 with dividend reinvested = 21.14%
if intrinsic return = earning growth + dividend growth + inflation, then the number is 21.76 .
The return of S&P500 in 2017 seems reasonable.

Many CASH Stocks :Looking FIERY ,Will update to Members.
1668 2018-01-15 02:31:32 Each Sunday I will post a current watch list of stocks  we are keeping an eye on for entries. We may or may not take these trades when they trigger it all depends on price action. If you decide to look at the list please use your own method of trading.
1669 2018-01-15 02:31:30 I want to buy stocks.
1670 2018-01-15 02:30:07 Before we post the current watch list and positions held let us remind you. 
"We are not investment advisors. We are just posting our current views on stocks/ETF's. Always use YOUR OWN trading strategy. Money management is key and know your risk.
1671 2018-01-15 02:29:33 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
1672 2018-01-15 02:29:09 20% off Knight and Day Jewellery. Offer available while stocks last. Supersedes other offers. Offer starts 09:00 26th December 2017 and ends 23:59 31st January 2018.
1673 2018-01-15 02:28:50 Korean Blockchain Stocks Rally as Government to Support R&D
1674 2018-01-15 02:28:40 I pointed out that he had contradicted himself, when talking about the Vegas shooting & bump stocks. Disagreed with him about his insistence that Paddock was lone shooter who committed suicide. If you catch him on a grouchy day, he doesn’t tolerate dissenters in the comments.
1675 2018-01-15 02:28:33 Personally I buy at each retracement level on/after 61% so around 901 and next would be 737, but up to you when you choose to dip in.  It looks like there is some resistance at those levels already. So could double bottom at 901.. hopefully we are close to a bounce back.
1676 2018-01-15 02:26:10 Roth 401 is the way to go, yes to stocks, w-2 helps in filing and getting money taken from the state and federal back as a refund, not sure on the other 3 I didn't answer
1677 2018-01-15 02:25:48 If the Fed Funds rate is zero/near zero the stock market is bound to rise as cheap money flows into stocks. It has nothing to do with the health of the economy. The entire stock market rise from early 2009 (from its bottom) till today is owing to this fact.
1678 2018-01-15 02:24:49 The goal of JDM is to find stocks/ETF's that are about to breakout to the long or short side. We let price action guide us in all entries and exits. We rely on technical analysis and make sure we filter out all the unnecessary noise
1679 2018-01-15 02:23:47 Ive been an adult for only 6 months and so I have a lot of questions. 
1. Why is a W-2 cool
2. What’s a vanguard account
3. Should I invest in stocks 
4. Roth- IRA?? 
5. Who’s gonna help me do my taxes lmfao 
6. When can I retire smh

1681 2018-01-15 02:23:03 Which stocks are reasonably priced ??
1682 2018-01-15 02:22:39 Won't do me any good since the top 10% own 80% of the stocks. Rich men dance while the poor man pays the band.
1683 2018-01-15 02:18:05 1. The stock market isn't "the economy"
2. Check a chart from 2009-2016 to see how stocks did during Obama
3. There's SHARED responsibility for economic success and struggle between previous & current administrations.
1684 2018-01-15 02:16:57 Under Obama I was making $72k/yr then lost job. Under Trump I am making $130k/yr after getting new job -- and doing less work. My personal stocks went up under this administration.
1685 2018-01-15 02:16:53 Asia stocks high and U.S dollar  slips head of U.S celebrates MLK holiday
1686 2018-01-15 02:16:32 1 Stocks were already rising under Obama, Trump is launching off of that success. 2 Trump is escalating the debt. 3 Neither will have tangible effect on anyone other than the wealthy
1687 2018-01-15 02:16:29 Stocks are economy? Job creation at all time low?
1688 2018-01-15 02:16:16 RW: Bank of Japans $50 Billion Question: When to Stop Buying Stocks
1689 2018-01-15 02:15:02 Swami, I like many others who have researched and reviewed $AGY for the last 2 years are sitting on 2300% profits. Keep believing your stale rhetoric, or just admit you got it wrong and move on to harass and harangue other stocks. You might get it right next time.
1690 2018-01-15 02:14:57 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels! America safer; we have great respect around the world. Making friends and allies, exposing enemies. Most of all people and God first in USA!
1691 2018-01-15 02:14:36 Actually got it in Brooklyn Heights, at the natural/organic market on Remsen Street, Perlandra Natural Foods. Looks like Whole Foods stocks it, and other healthy markets. Not too hard to find in my experience. Fairway has it, too, normally.

1697 2018-01-15 02:10:56 Stocks going up does not make America great. It makes stockholders rich.  It does’t help the economy and doesn’t create jobs.   Paying your employees a living wage, funding healthcare for all, and protecting children, the elderly, and the environment makes America great.
1698 2018-01-15 02:09:48 サイバーS高か。アエリアは今のペースでええんやで。
1699 2018-01-15 02:08:23 It does. But the only way those assets can buy other real assets is through that process. Want to buy stocks? Deposit in a bank? Buy a business? A home?
1700 2018-01-15 02:07:07 You're beyond stupid for believe your old man had ANYTHING to do with the rise in stocks. 1% rates forever elevate EVERY asset on the planet you tool...
1701 2018-01-15 02:05:31 Did you make these mistakes while investing in stocks in 2017?: Not all equity investors made money in 2017. Some…
1702 2018-01-15 02:04:59 I bet all the money you’ve made via stocks this last year completely agrees with this statement.. your completely insane if you really believe President Trump is Racist, and before you hate on me and call me racist don’t. There is Native American in my blood, PS how was Tokyo?

1705 2018-01-15 02:01:03 It was not even but it looks like it will continue to go that way.. I don't blindly follow anyone..obama ect..  the stock market isn't the king indicator.. many people don't have stocks..
1706 2018-01-15 01:57:24 And executives have a fiduciary responsibility to raise the value of stocks. Coincidence that they benefit too. There's no incentive to raise wages unless you run out of people

1713 2018-01-15 01:46:57 Agree with @ZenTrends 
The charts are very clear. Many stocks are also breaking out of huge multi-Yr bases, with plenty of room to run. Jenny asked us not to look at the charts. Hard for us to ignore.
1714 2018-01-15 01:46:48 So we won't pass common sense gun reforms like banning bump stocks.  Why do Republicans want automatic weapons in our communities?
1715 2018-01-15 01:45:32 After the starting price, it's a free market. Just like stocks. When buy side has more orders, the price goes up. When sell sides has more, price goes down.

1719 2018-01-15 01:41:23 You're talking about the same federal law that makes it illegal for convicted murderers and convicted rapists to own a gun. Do you expect the NRA to make a public statement against that law, when the NRA was calling for tighter regulation of bumpfire stocks, a few months ago?

1723 2018-01-15 01:38:07 I can fit in one lost the benefits of mmj stocks using thier own ico or block chain. The fact of the matter is even Canadian law enforcement wants these done so they can track the funds. It's the future it's here to stay .
1724 2018-01-15 01:37:40 It’s not illegal. Immoral maybe, but these aren’t stocks and have little to zero regulation. The only people who make money in pump and dumps are the admins who build positions prior to the call. Don’t be a stooge. Find a solid project and hold through the manipulation.

1730 2018-01-15 01:32:57 Their role in Raccoon City's destruction was partially publicized (the details of the T-Virus were not, though) and the government suspended their business. Their stocks crashed and they were screwed.

Umbrella Chronicles also tells of some conflict surrounding it.
1731 2018-01-15 01:31:46 agree - most are undervalued based on where market prices are today for the commodities. vanadium is the real interesting one - all the stocks are flying in that sector. Big news over the weekend to regarding EVs and major auto companies.

1757 2018-01-15 01:12:29 It is true, my 401 and Stocks doubled under Obama after the major hit it took from the housing bubble burst. The market went up %125 under Obama. Only %25 under DJT. Employment was already going down. Talk to the Carrier ex-employees that he promised to save their jobs.

1767 2018-01-15 00:59:44 Yes there is - small and value stocks are riskier, so the smallest and deepest value stocks have highest exposure to the factors, therefore expected to achieve higher returns. This is very well established, fwiw. Not my “opinion”

1773 2018-01-15 00:51:36 I understand some were making that choice. I appreciate the votes for Trump. Have you noticed what Trump has done to save our country? For example, following the Constitution, following the laws, jobs, economy, ISIS,  stocks, tax reductions, higher paychecks coming, is saving USA
1774 2018-01-15 00:50:30 You also should stop tweeting
1775 2018-01-15 00:50:22 Fox and u are always pretending Obama's numbers are ur numbers. So narcissistic & yet so vulnerable and desp at the same time. Btw those cuts are going to business and stocks that doesn't help me. Thx to you, I didn't even have an XMas this year. Jerk.

1784 2018-01-15 00:44:06 China is gaining intellectual and economic momentum & at a rising rate.  Despite the large 2017 rally, Chinese equities are not overpriced. Stock positioning is critical. Hold large cap Chinese stocks.  Avoid Chinese small caps. Big is pervasively beautiful in Chinese equities.
1785 2018-01-15 00:43:23 Come to think about it, what about @realDonaldTrump’s tweets about multiple private companies? We know the effect he’s had on their stocks, but what about his violation of this rule! Ain’t he ‘the’ top?
1786 2018-01-15 00:43:19 Stocks and shares too not bloody fb or twitter shares

1793 2018-01-15 00:34:27 Macro: Is current recovery in China stocks (Shanghai Comp Index) a hint of Econ future? Or false start ahead of Econ erosion.
1794 2018-01-15 00:34:15 Agree…it’s just that NKTR is one of those stocks where you wake up one morning with a 70% loss on a gap down FDA decision move. NVDA, not so much.

1814 2018-01-15 00:10:58 I have a 401k and own stocks.  It helps me and I am nowhere near the top 10%.  You should buy some stocks, invest in America, and stop whining.
1815 2018-01-15 00:10:41 Going to try and get over for the screening. Hope it goes well  Paul #mancmade
1816 2018-01-15 00:09:27 FWIW there are still no borrows available. One of the strangest stocks Ive seen with borrows.
1817 2018-01-15 00:08:36 Y las subidas que vienen después de años de cosechas bajas en cantidad y calidad y el final de los stocks de la época de crisis
1818 2018-01-15 00:06:39 Lol at Delroy Warmington.....so easy for u to suggest the JA government buy out the remaining stocks in JAMALCO. U however neglect the volatility of the metals market as well as the inherent costs to maintain such a plant. This would be a RISKY gamble.
1819 2018-01-15 00:05:25 Buy some bank stocks
1820 2018-01-15 00:05:10 Yesterday, one of my stocks jumped over 15%.
1821 2018-01-15 00:04:02 I opened it last jan 8 po. Tight deadline kasi konti na lang stocks sa korea
1822 2018-01-15 00:03:05 Been watching for awhile.  Aside from the ones making new all time highs where you can simply buy the previous resistance acting as support, it is not easy at all, at least compared to stocks.  Way too slow for my taste.  Lots of fake bounces and grindy choppy action.
1823 2018-01-15 00:01:59 Fellas we moving different in 2018 and investing in stocks
1824 2018-01-15 00:01:53 yah no worries about my US stocks going down tomorrow.

1826 2018-01-15 00:00:19 The only thing that will create these better paying jobs that you dream about is demand. More money to corps will go into execs pockets and stock buy backs (which is great for stock value if you have stocks, which most working class people don't). This is simply how it works.
