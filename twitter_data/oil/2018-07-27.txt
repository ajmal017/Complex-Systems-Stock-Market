17 2018-07-27 23:56:39 Would you guys be interested in a video series where I buy and review different oil paint colors? I'm thinking specifically paint from Williamsburg because 1. it's too expensive to not know exactly what you're getting and 2. they have a lot of unique colors.

68 2018-07-27 23:51:30 Cooking for friends. Who the hell knew the food processor plunger has a hole in it? Its to gradually add oil in order to make mayonnaise. I don't make mayonnaise, but I freaking CAN with this hole. My life is close to complete. P.S. trump sucks.
69 2018-07-27 23:51:29 No, and they will continue to leak oil in that regard, but, overall, I sense a creeping, Fredi-style, late season malaise coming on early. By Monday, we’ll know if I’m right.
70 2018-07-27 23:51:17 The work afterwards wasn't. marshall mistake, huge amount of oil on the exit of turn 2 and should have been red flagged 1 lap before. Before that we were 0.5 sec's per lap quicker than the rest of the field
71 2018-07-27 23:51:07 It'll get done, we're starting the Alberta side of the expansion. 

Finally, our oil won't be held hostage by West Texas Intermediate crude pricing any longer.

73 2018-07-27 23:51:00 You're using "capitalism" and "cronyism" interchangeably & that is impossible.  One is one thing, the other is another thing.  A hammer is NOT a quart of oil.  Capitalism is NOT Cronyism.  Supporting Capitalism is the OPPOSITE of supporting police or politicians.
74 2018-07-27 23:50:47 my boyfriend literally went to fill my tires and put in oil and said “ so you don’t have to worry about doing it tomorrow.” oh god i’m so grateful for this kid . got so blessed

90 2018-07-27 23:47:25 It will allow Canada to strip its natural resources, not develop them. And bitumen's dangerous stuff - how do you clean up an oil spill when the oil sinks?
91 2018-07-27 23:47:13 So your saying a nation of 5 million people subsidise the rest of the UK? Plus it's not Scotland's oil or Gas it's the UK's.

103 2018-07-27 23:45:52 Oh, & good point about the ‘radical Islam’ scare tactics, too, Bex.

It’s a position from ignorance. 
Wahabi (Saudi) Islam is the most restrictive. Look up Saudi Arabia on the map, it’s not huge. 
Even with all their oil $$, they don’t control Sunni or Shi’a Muslims.

126 2018-07-27 23:41:50 One question: if socialism is so great can you explain what happened in Venezuela?  FYI: is a country with the largest oil reserves. Everyone in that country should be rich. No one has been able to give a logic explanation. I hope you can.
127 2018-07-27 23:41:45 No marketplace goes unregulated. 

If not regulated by government, then mob rule will attempt to purge any cancer that threatens to make said marketplace unpopular.

146 2018-07-27 23:39:56 So what I am trying to get at is I am sure some oil people didn't want more wind farms and put a bug into the Gov's ear and the PUC put a kibosh on it. That's the Texas way.
147 2018-07-27 23:39:40 The original is nice, but for something on the wall I'd take the oil.
148 2018-07-27 23:39:38 i wanna try the wake and bake oil as soon as i can tbh
149 2018-07-27 23:39:05 I have mixed emotions about keeping Libyan oil flowing, as it means revenues from oil may flow to jihadi groups.. American companies should make up the shortfalls

152 2018-07-27 23:38:36 I never got an oil change with my first car , if I had known this I wouldn’t have come here for this car either  what the fuuuuuuccckkkkkkk. Why isn’t getting gas enough ?

191 2018-07-27 23:33:26 CBD oil is now LIVE for pre-order in UK and Europe will ship August 14th  let me know if you need my site!
192 2018-07-27 23:33:23 That's temporary. The same thing happened in CO at first. It will take some time for the market to stabilize. You can get oil for like $20 a gram all day now.

194 2018-07-27 23:32:28 There are so many ways to show this claim is legitimate.  Fuel receipts, odometer reading on invoices for oil changes or maintenance visits, meeting calendar, etc.  If no proof is offered immediately it seems pretty clear she’s been caught and is now formulating a strategy #ableg

196 2018-07-27 23:32:18 Green energy is not “nonsense”.  Remaining dependent on oil, gas or coal is.  The sun and the wind are free unless of course you live in a backward state that discourages their use with taxes.
197 2018-07-27 23:31:54 Never a good word. 
Missed your tweet thanking President Trump for the return of our fallen from DPRK. 
Never even  crossed your mind, did it.
198 2018-07-27 23:31:22 CBD oil is a life saver!

200 2018-07-27 23:31:07 So, when are you going to reimburse taxpayers?

More than a decade after the former Indiana oil company of Vice President Mike Pence’s family filed for bankruptcy, taxpayers are bearing the costs of millions of dollars to clean up more than 85 contaminated sites, a report says.

208 2018-07-27 23:29:42 Prices will always go up, but never down. Just like prices at the pump. They sure jump up fast when oil prices climb, but are really slow to drop when the prices come down.

210 2018-07-27 23:29:36 @1011_News I have a story about how Super Saver is hiding information from customers regarding their oil.
211 2018-07-27 23:29:35 I'm a dumbass and didn't know that oil doesn't sizzle until you put something in it, but otherwise the falafel came out great
212 2018-07-27 23:29:29 Glad you reminded me. I’ve got to get that 6 pack. The oil is a must just before bed.
213 2018-07-27 23:29:24 Does Buhari have any say on how the 13% derivative paid to oil producing states in the Niger Delta spent???

215 2018-07-27 23:29:10 I see. At least you fine folks from 'The Lone State' are getting almost $70.00/barrel of oil meanwhile up here in Alberta, we're getting less than $30.00. 

But we're fighting with B.C to build the Trans Mountain Expansion. We're hoping to sell our oil to Asian pacific countries.
216 2018-07-27 23:28:54 Oil is on it's way out. Our country America, is following a path of global destruction and extinction, sad.
217 2018-07-27 23:28:04 I was also on the coast of Louisiana where the BP Horizon blew up. Dozens of my friends had their shrimp boats leased by BP to collect oil. Very little if any oil was collected contrary to the reported 250k gallons there were collecting weekly. Was it the Gulf Stream they wanted.
218 2018-07-27 23:27:44 baby oil or mineral oil girl!! works wonders.

228 2018-07-27 23:25:55 No question! This is fucking ridiculous. Trump owes money to Russian oligarchs. Therefore he owes Putin. As soon as Tillerson was tapped for SOS I knew this was bullshit. This has always been about money, oil and sanctions.

251 2018-07-27 23:22:14 Do you have any CBD oil? Arnica Montana cream? I sell a line of hemp-derived products and in desperation, I put some of our pain rub on a nasty skeeter bite. That did the trick.
252 2018-07-27 23:22:07 Someone probably has said this but essential oils. Lavender is so relaxing!  Doterra has an oil called Clary Calm which I love

260 2018-07-27 23:20:37 I LOVE pizza and make it quite often, making my own dough or using pre-made dough (sold in bags with 3 loaves of frozen dough per bag).  Pre-made pizza shells are also a big help.  I use olive oil, crushed tomatoes,  mozzarella or White American cheese, garlic salt, basil.
261 2018-07-27 23:20:03 You're right. I think powerful drug companies are responsible for a lot more indirect social damage than most people are aware of. After the military and oil, they're probably the third most powerful nefarious influence.

273 2018-07-27 23:18:15 Part of it is due to countries buying things before the tariffs kicked in. China increased its soybean purchases and crude oil. That's not sustainable.

301 2018-07-27 23:14:39 I’m just a large pool of olive oil tbh
302 2018-07-27 23:14:38 You also need to remember the RNS was to confirm the clean up had finished and the actual EWT was starting. So for oil to free flow to the surface on a clean up is a positive to me. Along with the fact the 352 barrels was achieved using a smaller choke than in 2016 #UKOG
303 2018-07-27 23:14:34 It gets frustrating because my skin is super oily but I’ve tried so many products and the oil always breaks through. I can’t even tell you how much money I’ve spent on shit

312 2018-07-27 23:12:59 OK the US's had a record PIB  growth of 4.1%,  but it has budget deficit tht's gone frm 585$bn in 2016 to 833$bn in 2018 and it's epected to reach 985$bn in 2019. How long can this go on before things turn sour. In any case a large portion of the PIB growth is attibutable to oil

316 2018-07-27 23:12:28 Ask any company why they are moving south and I don't mean US, oil investment is checking out, auto industry checking out, levi in Mexico now, Heinz checked out of Ontario. High taxes and Unions that's why!

323 2018-07-27 23:11:36 SO we ran inside, I tried calling my husband for remedies, he didn't pick up, I googled remedies, we didn't have aloe vera or anything of the sort, so I found out coconut oil would also do the trick. After rubbing that in & wrapping her up, I went to get her the now cold dinner.

350 2018-07-27 23:05:26 If being Middle Eastern is being a hipster, then guilty as charged.

It’s a spice. Goes really well with olive oil too. You should even try making a toast by spreading olive oil on it, with zaatar, and then toast it.

360 2018-07-27 23:03:40 Prayers for her. I lost my 9 year old son to brain cancer. It’s an awful disease. I highly recommend hemp oil. We used it with my son, and while it wasn’t a cure for him, it did minimize many of the symptoms the tumor caused.

362 2018-07-27 23:03:15 To be clear there is no CONFIDENCE in Traitor Trump 
The national debt at all time high 
Federal land with resources being sold to the 1% oil/gas/lumber corp
Air, water & land being destroyed with removal of EPA regulations 
Education being compromised for $ to private corp
363 2018-07-27 23:03:05 There’s more to your Trump agenda that you don’t share w/ your supporters & that’s: destroying our environment, rolling back protections for endangered species, promoting coal & oil that pollutes our air, water, land, selling national monument sites, etc. Your agenda SUCKS!
364 2018-07-27 23:02:50 Yeah I always rinse in the shower. The trick with hair dye is to coat yourself in oil before rinsing.
365 2018-07-27 23:02:40 帝都へ。
366 2018-07-27 23:02:27 A yes... the burden of oil and not having trident.  And don't even bother mentioning the barnett forumla, a formula that takes tax from Scotland and only gives some of it back.
367 2018-07-27 23:02:17 Try using a pinch of butter instead using oil, and cook it with a medium flame. :D
368 2018-07-27 23:01:40 I guess this is a misunderstanding, what I mean about fuel going as far as they can is about price, Arabs control the price of oil. When Russia and China were ready to make the famous silk road, but with oil, that's when they lower their prices per barrel to make it impossible to

371 2018-07-27 23:01:28 We’re innovative. We can & must find safer, more sustainable methods; fossil fuels are NOT practical, safe or sustainable. That’s been proven. I’m confident “rare earth metals” are much more containable and manageable. “Big oil” sabotages innovations other technologies.

407 2018-07-27 22:53:49 it's not a bad idea!! as long as you take proper care of your hair, you can bleach & dye it as many times as you want! i strongly recommend doing an overnight mask with pure coconut oil after you bleach & dye.

440 2018-07-27 22:48:14 Just wing it Nikki and go with the flow , it all works out in the end. Today I might get amongst my oil paints and create a whole new scene... 
441 2018-07-27 22:48:10 Unless you consider yourself one of the snake oil salesmen, not really. Here's the thing. The people selling the snake oil - they KNOW the numbers. They KNOW there's nothing to justify this. But they push it anyway.
442 2018-07-27 22:47:58 Old oil it is
443 2018-07-27 22:47:19 my new primer smells like canola oil and I really don’t know how to feel
444 2018-07-27 22:47:12 They are like the @ChickfilA of oil changes.
445 2018-07-27 22:47:11 So me and Emily just came back to our hotel room and we have been gifted fruit kebabs, 3 truffles and a whole bottle of extra virgin olive oil ??? Mam and dad are in a different room and don’t have it ??? Help are we being abducted
446 2018-07-27 22:47:02 @Shell Hello I have a doubt, I live in Venezuela at a minimum temperature of 60 • F to maximum 93 • F, I bought a 10w 30 mineral oil auto cleaning for 3 Toyota vehicles with 10,000mi, 22,000 mi and 70,000 mi, my question is can I use that oil in my 3 cars, in VENEZUELA
447 2018-07-27 22:46:53 DT is waging a WAR on OCEANS! Having spent day at beach this is DISASTER! DT opened up 90% of coastal waters to OIL/GAS DRILLING and just “threw out regulations” protecting ecosystems! DT reckless abuse of coastline IS NOT REVERSABLE! Please VOTE BLUE to save our coastline!!

449 2018-07-27 22:46:39 the Trump administration is waging what some have dubbed a “war on oceans.’’ The president has opened 90 percent of coastal waters to oil and gas drilling and watered down or rescinded dozens of regulations and standards that protect marine ecosystems and the coastal habitat.
450 2018-07-27 22:46:09 Check the oil in the delorean....
451 2018-07-27 22:45:33 Get you a man who will do your oil change himself
452 2018-07-27 22:45:32 Extra virgin olive oil. Ask Father to bless it as anointing oil! Anoint yourself.  You sprit is calling to God. Go somewhere quiet. Talk to the Lord. I believe your being called. I’ll explain soon.
453 2018-07-27 22:45:32 A moderately viscous mineral oil would work. Non conductive, and will help cool the circuit and leave a slippery mess in your wake.
454 2018-07-27 22:45:30 I finally scheduled my oil change appt. My oil life is at 10% 
455 2018-07-27 22:45:21 Westerners* and is that why you decided to invade our countries and kill innocent people. We've become so much to handle that you just can't get enough of our oil and land.
456 2018-07-27 22:45:18 Absolute incompetence, trying to replace the gross production tax on oil with other small gimicks like new license plates and tobacco taxes, crippling cuts to all departments, and her recent handling of medical marijuana to name a few.
457 2018-07-27 22:44:57 Truffle oil
458 2018-07-27 22:44:45 Houthis Claim to have used a new drone they built "Samad 3" to bomb Abu Dhabi airport. This new drone's range is 1500 KM (about 930 miles). Last month they used "Samad 2" to bomb an oil refinery in Riyadh (700 KM ~ 430 miles). Of course this means also Hizbollah has these drones.

461 2018-07-27 22:43:39 I expect nothing less. Not so much a president as a traveling snake oil salesman.

463 2018-07-27 22:43:31 i tried to press play on desperate housewives four times before i realized i was clicking the button on my oil pen and not the remote
464 2018-07-27 22:43:26 Actual you should shave the hair  even me as a man do that cuz you can collect oil,bugs,disease,stench,and other stuff so it a good idea to be safe and clean
465 2018-07-27 22:43:12 A Chevy Yukon and a Ford Focus have a a “virtually nil” MPG difference? And yeah I realize it’s not the 70’s, all it will take is an oil issue out of the Middle East and it will sure as hell look like it. Maybe you’re not old enough to remember the miles long lines and limits
466 2018-07-27 22:43:08 Same I wake up with an oil spill on my face ksjdjfhfj
467 2018-07-27 22:42:58 How do you go 40,000 miles without an oil change and get mad when you need a new engine??
468 2018-07-27 22:42:48 Wars started literally for oil
469 2018-07-27 22:42:39 Rock vs Finn Balor. Rock cuts 45min promos on every raw & smackdown to Wrestlemania, Finn responds every week with rubbing baby oil on his abs and doing 200 sit-ups! 
470 2018-07-27 22:42:34 i wonder if that #cbd #hemp oil or the #cannabis for #epilepsy would help him?  beautiful, precious baby.  i love ur tweets, thank u 4 them.
471 2018-07-27 22:42:27 I miss my oil pen 
472 2018-07-27 22:42:21 Use heart healthy cooking oils such as olive oil, canola oil or mustard oil. Avoid sunflower oil, safflower oil, ghee, butter, margaraine.
473 2018-07-27 22:41:59 Water - worth more than gold, jewells, oil, paintings, property, crap MP’s, zinc, tin, Royals, food, oil, food, material things, money, cash, BBC, diamonds. Wales has it in abundance. My people do not need what we produce. We should be charging proper market value for it.
474 2018-07-27 22:41:56 I'll agree with quinoa, but blueberries are to die for. 
I'll add one. Calamari. Why don't they just shred up a dunlop and splash some oil on it?
475 2018-07-27 22:41:54 Oil companies don't pollute, it's the people using their products!
476 2018-07-27 22:41:25 So ive been looking for was to get rid of all my small pimples! Eww i hate that word, and i think ive got it down. Ill keep updating.

477 2018-07-27 22:41:07 LADIES LISTEN UP: start mixing in coconut oil into your skin care routine. 

i’ve been using it instead of my regular moisturizer after i wash my face and BOI my skin is glowing. it’s healthy, it’s natural, and it works so well. i promise.
478 2018-07-27 22:41:02 Coconut oil been lookin’ like cream soda.

480 2018-07-27 22:40:51 The rank and file who bought the snake oil, not necessarily. The people selling the snake oil, probably.
481 2018-07-27 22:40:49 Incessant campaign against a $TSLA building new industries from scratch, while cheering on Big Oil and Legacy Auto is "punching down". Get your David and Goliath straight.
482 2018-07-27 22:40:46 So I just bought CBD oil and tried it for the first time. Pretty cool! It took away pain on some bruises I just recently got and it also made me relaxed for a short period of time (2 hours or so). I got the lowest dosage possible and it still worked so it's pretty cool!
483 2018-07-27 22:40:45 I know. Remember where you came from. Your a child of God. Anoint yourself with some extra virgin olive oil. Ask the Father to bless it as anointing oil. Anoint yourself.Demand anything evil away from you! You must be a powerful soul.Satan only attacks/those who he’s afraid of!
484 2018-07-27 22:40:39 Attack on Saudi oil tankers not a good move for Iran.  Closing the waterway would hurt them more.  Having troops there right now yes.  Iran will calm down.
485 2018-07-27 22:40:37 All these things happen in the futures markets today. Look at sugar or even crude oil.
486 2018-07-27 22:40:33 Time for the oil change?

494 2018-07-27 22:39:46 @IrisOnTV Iris:  As time goes on. I think that the oil gas prices should stay about the same for each state. Because the Oil industry is running out of oil from Alaska.
495 2018-07-27 22:39:40 IDK his IQ. lol
I think his problem was arrogance; bc he's an oil painter and he just simply doesn't respect my methods, and isn't willing to try to understand. 
IDK I was not trying to make him feel stupid either, just honestly explaining as best I could. x_x
496 2018-07-27 22:39:30 Has she ever mentioned once the needles, homeless or human crap on the streets of California?
497 2018-07-27 22:39:27 I can do salmon in 280. 425, skin on down side, salt & pepper. Olive oil over and under. Cook and eat
498 2018-07-27 22:39:24 I hear ya! I'm always nervous when I work on an oil painting, but it always comes out better than expected and no doubt this will too:)
499 2018-07-27 22:39:24 I once was a victim of revenge spam and got 5k email list signups in an hour for the widest variety of stuff: kosher tours, olive oil massage, turtle socks, you name it. I still get them sometimes and I LOVE deleting them.
500 2018-07-27 22:39:24 Then sun dry it and apply baby oil............. 
Who does that?
501 2018-07-27 22:39:09 Do you have any lavender oil? That helps calm me down sooooo much!

511 2018-07-27 22:36:59 The Hydrogen economy is an old energy strategy formed by the Japanese Government when they saw their dependence on entirely foreign oil as a national security issue. They dreamed of energy independence on the basis of their extensive nuclear energy grid used to make hydrogen.

513 2018-07-27 22:36:20 Im no sympathiser to ISIS or any war for that matter, and I'm far from being a do gooder, but if we think back, this has all focused on OIL.
If the MJ12 would let the new tech filter through to the big Co's they'd be no war or greenhouse effect.
The illuminati is the real enemy
514 2018-07-27 22:35:48 What a true leader should've done is invest the oil boom to diversify venezuelas economy but they squandered a golden opportunity.

522 2018-07-27 22:35:20 So, tell us how can/will Felda, for all it's domestic "clout", influence world palm oil prices for it's benefit? And tell buyers to choose palm oil from M'sia? Simple questions, yes?
523 2018-07-27 22:35:02 I hate dating. I just want to skip to the part of the relationship where I'm handcuffed to a radiator with my feet having been amputated, and you're dressed in a witch costume, burning documents in an oil barrel as the police surround the building.
524 2018-07-27 22:35:00 The biggest concern i have is construction is only starting at a few locations, it's going to be 5 years if not longer to finish this thing, all while Alberta industry is absolutely killed selling oil at half price to Americans that are now exporting their own oil at full price.

530 2018-07-27 22:33:33 Looks like the stamp matrix is soft enough that it has an inset pattern. Try soaking the paper and printing it wet, and thin the ink a little-- is this oil or water-based ink? looks pretty tacky and a little over-inked, so if water-based could also be drying as it's rolled on
531 2018-07-27 22:33:19 Then go back to working on your oil bs, nobody asked you to be here
532 2018-07-27 22:33:07 I have enough hot oil in my head to fry a shitload of things, believe me.

Was it to do with the burning extra oil or something? Cos if they did a deal, does it mean they are still doing it??
537 2018-07-27 22:32:34 In my day we — I mean they — just called it hash oil.

Good move , more tailpipe emissions, then U can use the oil from Alaska for gas we don't need for the extra gas and lower mileage !

551 2018-07-27 22:30:07 Smart thread, @joshdr83 and I think your insight that booming oil will depress NG prices and hurt wind's economics. But this project could have been a big hedge against 1) oil/gas price volatility & 2) a future carbon price.

556 2018-07-27 22:29:47 I ran. Sprinted, in fact.   As a lifelong New Yorker, Trump’s particular brand of hate and snake oil was well known. That’s why he was landslided in the state on Election Day, more so than any other R in recent history.
557 2018-07-27 22:29:39 If I were president I would go total natural & solar energy. Clean out or replace the oil pipeline to use to transfer water from one place to another.

559 2018-07-27 22:29:28 Mustard Oil is an old remedy for dry lips. Before bed, dab a few drops onto your lips &amp; massage it slightly, making them soft &amp; smooth.

561 2018-07-27 22:29:08 PSA: I've been taking salmon oil pills every day for a couple weeks now (at the advice of my mom) not knowing that it's actually good for ACNE! ESPECIALLY HORMONAL ACNE LADIES!!! When I noticed my skin lacking its usual cluster of pimples I was like "???" so I did some research..
562 2018-07-27 22:28:59 All I use on my skin is raw organic coconut oil.
563 2018-07-27 22:28:23 Oil shipments by rail for export reached an all time high recently. Is it your opinion that rail transport is safer than by pipeline? Is it your position that oil will stop flowing in Canada anytime in the next few decades? More pragmatism, less ideological positioning welcome.

566 2018-07-27 22:28:10 Makes me want to scream knowing that Putin/Trump want to exploit the arctic  They'll destroy everything they can in the pursuit of oil.

568 2018-07-27 22:27:57 Today I learned NOT to pour hot oil into glass containers. Glad no one caught a shard of glass.
569 2018-07-27 22:27:55 you and Jamie strike me as oil and water (played with Jamie few times). Not surprised.
570 2018-07-27 22:27:49 Wait for it: Lobster oil... GOLD.
571 2018-07-27 22:27:33 The problems can be attributed to large scale corruption.

Maduro has ruled by decree for most of his presidency, and together with the fall in the price of oil is responsible for the decline in Venezuela, which he exploits.

Chavez had used oil revenue for social policies.
572 2018-07-27 22:27:22 Trouble with putting olive oil in your ears at night is that every dream involves a tomato salad.
573 2018-07-27 22:27:19 Socialism without ecology brings things like Bolivia destroying rainforest on indigenous lands to extract oil and gas and build highways
574 2018-07-27 22:26:48 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities." ~Psalms 141:5 #Jesus #God #Bible

577 2018-07-27 22:25:54 Please show me how this has helped rural oklahoma. Big oil is drilling everywhere but that is temporary. History shows it.
578 2018-07-27 22:25:30 You do know that you can easily change any plastic back into oil don't you?
579 2018-07-27 22:25:25 @MidwestInd would you like to be part of oil extraction from COAL  process perfected in WW2
580 2018-07-27 22:25:05 I listened to a podcast this morning w/ Chef AJ, who is a vegan, doesn't use oil and I don't think she uses nuts either - she claims this is the best diet for weight loss and cancer prevention. 
Who is right, you or Chef AJ?
I don't know.
581 2018-07-27 22:25:02 Heave lifting from #Obama?  What was that?  The feds were pumping money into the economy like an oil well pumps oil. 10 Trillion in debt accumulated. Any dip shit can throw money at something in the hopes it gets fixed. Have done the same with schools for decades. Results = NADA
582 2018-07-27 22:24:51 I love that this product is oil free! And i can wear it for 12 hours. This is top of the line when it comes to Concealer

Bloody expensive, in other words. A sample bottle of lobster oil drops included for the most top-tier Patreon subscribers.
585 2018-07-27 22:24:21 I like sweet bell pepper, cucumbers, firm tomatoes, kalamatras, red onion, fresh basil, goat cheese/feta, with a fruity olive oil and red wine vinegar greek dressing. Yes that is divine!

588 2018-07-27 22:24:03 Has anyone on the TL used wild growth hair oil?
589 2018-07-27 22:23:51 I'd take day-old plain rice and cook it up with oil and random food scraps to make fried rice. That's about as fancy as I would get, anyways.
590 2018-07-27 22:23:49 I didn’t expect oil tycoons to become tree hugging Eco warriors overnight. Remember they’re only in it for the dosh !

595 2018-07-27 22:23:26 Castor oil is just blessing my beard
596 2018-07-27 22:23:24 Starbucks needs to put all that sugar and cream because the coffee itself taste like oil.
597 2018-07-27 22:23:18 Your politicians have been manipulated by zealots for forty  years - controlled by oil and Israel interests. So sad, so much good could have been done with all that wealth pissed away destructively.
598 2018-07-27 22:23:17 anyway we got our shift in a few hours ago and he’s super chill and was late bc the oil change he got took way longer than it should’ve but that’s not his fault—i’m just glad he got here and that he’s so easygoing

Sweat makes it easy to enjoy ones partner
No need for oil

605 2018-07-27 22:22:20 Here’s a grand bargain, as the record heat (again) envelops the world. Cut a deal with the TX oil companies - in 30 years, no more oil for cars. But for the last 25, get all of our oil from US/Canada/Mexico. Fund it with taxes on imports, subsidies for domestic production.

616 2018-07-27 22:20:30 Hey @FordCanada @SherwoodFord do you always tell your customers a standard oil change is 70$ then give them a 100$ bill when they come to pick up their car because of "miscellaneous charges" or was I just lucky today? You could have at least washed my car for the extra 30$
617 2018-07-27 22:20:14 I would never! Do you know how much MORE oil they have to put in those to make it taste good? 
618 2018-07-27 22:20:00 Guy, there are so many options to it. Idk what he was thinking tbh. Sai na chaka ma yarinya wuqa a duwawu.

645 2018-07-27 22:16:21 I comb mine. Blow dry and flat iron it once. It'll be easier to handle. If you want the 'fro look then after blow drying(not everyday though)it, use coconut oil and plait every night. It becomes a lot easier to handle in the morning.

649 2018-07-27 22:16:05 And maybe it should be clear that those who are so desperate for PMB to go are those whose oil block has been taken away from and are desperately looking to get them back and those whose personal workers are paid by the FG and their source of milking this country is blocked

659 2018-07-27 22:15:17 CAUTION

Know the provenance of the products you plan to ingest.

Oils are concentrates.

If the plant used had been treated with pesticides there is a likelihood that concentrating it into an oil will concentrate the poisons.

662 2018-07-27 22:14:53 Let me end with these words: Some Nigerian states are poor not because they are not receiving a fair share of oil money but because they are not receiving a fair shot at true federalism. Only restructuring can correct that.- Atiku

712 2018-07-27 22:07:27 @PurpleMentat According to wikipedia, butter is a type of cooking oil, (and ice cream is generally churned, so...) but mayonnaise is defined not only by ingredients, but also usage: it has to be a sauce.  As such, lemon ice cream MIGHT be a mayonnaie, but only (1/2)

769 2018-07-27 21:59:54  honest answer is I don’t 100% know. It’s certainly not an exhaust for the engine, I think it might be to vent oil vapors or similar from the engine core. Someone much more mechanically minded than me will know!

780 2018-07-27 21:58:06 Kinky hair isn’t like straight hair. If we use a lot of shampoo it dries out and breaks our hair. Kinks make it impossible for the sebum (oil) from our scalp to travel down our hair shaft. That’s why our hair doesn’t get oily.

and therefore felt incredibly patronized.
806 2018-07-27 21:54:20 Adulting is actually quite nice! Went to get an oil change today and they had free WiFi and free coffee while I waited. They said it'd take an hour but just 20 minutes later, they told me the oil drain plug was stuck would be $469 and 4hrs if I need to replace it! Love adulting!
807 2018-07-27 21:53:39 They could but the oil companies don't have that much time invested in commercials to play 9 mins on that dedication.
808 2018-07-27 21:53:30 @KwikKarMurphy   Be very careful. Got Mercedes oil changed. Reused the washer around oil plug and caused leak. Cost $xx at Mercedes as thought had engine problem. Will never use again.

858 2018-07-27 21:44:46 Jojoba oil is the greatest oil ever

861 2018-07-27 21:44:12 I’m not accepting anyone else lmao. I’m not open to it. Sooo he better take his vitamins and put some oil on his joints bc he got work to do. 

And yes, Storm better be black or I’m rioting. They owe us. The dropped the ball (severely) TWICE

863 2018-07-27 21:43:30 How I wish Buhari was president during that bukutu sipping dullard's tenure. With oil prices at 100 dollars, he would have totally transformed this country. My PVC is for you feb 2019
864 2018-07-27 21:43:23 «herself up again and worked her way down Therese's spine with her fingertips. It was a sensitive area on the human body, so she decreased the pressure to a minimum and put a bit more oil.
865 2018-07-27 21:43:03 USA did even greater than Turkey, while Turkey is still buying Iranian oil
866 2018-07-27 21:42:53 You are pointing this out after 15 years of collaborating with the oil and gas industry
867 2018-07-27 21:42:44 Wo!!! Give am plenty palm oil to lick first then spank the hell out of him joor.
868 2018-07-27 21:42:42 Trumps ongoing "mess" is a perfect

Pesticides, Flint, Puerto Rico, trophy killing, endangered species,
drilling for oil etc.etc.etc.
869 2018-07-27 21:42:12 what’s groundnut/vegetable oil called in Yoruba ?
870 2018-07-27 21:41:44 CBD oil comin in clutch today
871 2018-07-27 21:41:36 Lmao I did leave in conditioner and oil then combed or picked through it to make sure it got the ends and the roots and then a bonnet
872 2018-07-27 21:41:30 And the best trash can oil that money can buy. Which really is the modern day “Sangria “
873 2018-07-27 21:41:23 そーなんだよなー奴はそういうとこあるから…
874 2018-07-27 21:41:14 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
875 2018-07-27 21:41:14 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
876 2018-07-27 21:40:54 I also mentioned that the NDAA comes with riders. Last time some Democrats voted for it because it included a bill that made oil companies pay for their own spills. And again, they get equal domestic spending from each dollar spent on the military, so it's in their interest
877 2018-07-27 21:40:48 os caras fazem playlist de surf music e não colocam UM men at World, nem UM midnight oil.... sinceramente
878 2018-07-27 21:40:47 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
879 2018-07-27 21:40:42 and iol i guess oil in included in that.
880 2018-07-27 21:40:33 The oil sands companies seem to be always moving ahead with enviro improvements so a study based on 5 years ago seems a bit behind. And last time I looked, Trent University is situated in Peterborough Ontario.
881 2018-07-27 21:40:30 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
882 2018-07-27 21:40:27 Oil indeed won't last forever... but that doesn't make a $120K EV make sense either  :)

If the price were half, it would be worth serious consideration.  Price is the only remaining barrier to EVs taking over.
883 2018-07-27 21:40:25 When oil was over $100 the acts they brought in still sucked. Their deficit is because of themselves.

885 2018-07-27 21:39:51 US eyed only the oil, but Russia saw the food potential as well.
886 2018-07-27 21:39:39 The oil in the machine.
887 2018-07-27 21:39:38 Try John West Tuna in Sunflower oil. But remove from the can and break it up and sprinkle bay leaves, water cress and shallots over it. If I were you I would try Sea Bass but in a good restaurant with a reliable chef. It's more delicious than salmon.
888 2018-07-27 21:39:37 everybody knows that when Trump starts whining, Mitch Mcconnell cries for mama #resist
889 2018-07-27 21:38:52 1/ Trump has a piece of the 19.5% sale in Rosneft & wants to collect his share of  Artic Oil drill
2/  Trump wants a tower in Moscow
3/ Trump & Putin want war in ME so they can drive up oil prices & get sanctions lifted for Artic Oil drilling 
4/ Putin's economy is in the toilet
890 2018-07-27 21:38:46 Made the mistake of using olive oil on my body after the shower instead of lotion so when I sat down to pee after I literally slid off the toilet #rip
891 2018-07-27 21:38:46 Most likely burning oil. It’s your car saying shoudda bought a camaro or kept the Jeep
892 2018-07-27 21:38:33 Counting sweethearthow sweet it is to be in your company  and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity~a treasure to be desired & an oil in the dwelling of the wise!
893 2018-07-27 21:38:29 I agree there is a lag, but I don't think the drops return to the previous level post spike. Honestly, this is intuition and not data, so I defer to any data driven responses. Anyone know of a good public data set on oil vs gas price?
894 2018-07-27 21:38:28 Theive’s oil? Ewww. That is horrible for my complexion.
895 2018-07-27 21:38:21 This BC heat wave is brutal. Good thing we're not building another oil pipeline. Oh wait... #nokm #nopipelines, @JustinTrudeau. #climatechange
896 2018-07-27 21:38:11 Try fenty beauty and dr Brandt’s pore no more. My makeup lasts longer and I use blotting pads to control the oil. I’m oily no matter but it still looks like I just did my makeup all day.
897 2018-07-27 21:38:04 uh idk if this counts as medicating? lol. but cbd oil helps a lot a lot a lot. and it doesn’t make you feel high or anything plus it’s legal so you can buy it in any smoke shop or online!
898 2018-07-27 21:38:02 @Blaney so I was getting my cars oil changed today and was listening to the podcast while waiting. When they cranked my car to move it, my phone connected to the Bluetooth and played the poop talk for the poor mechanic just trying to do his job.
899 2018-07-27 21:37:51 Oil Prices to Sky rocket!
900 2018-07-27 21:37:35 Bruh, stop by my shop I'll change your oil man.
901 2018-07-27 21:37:25 Blueberry pancakes with coconut oil and coconut nectar 
902 2018-07-27 21:37:16 It must be something you know about the money and oil? You tell us or better yet tell Mueller!

904 2018-07-27 21:36:58 trying to smoke my oil pen in public without getting caught is an extreme sport
905 2018-07-27 21:36:58 Blatant display of gross #corruption .. thanks for selling our future to oil companies and racking up the debt for our future generations to pay while they clean the oil spill and bail out oil giants
906 2018-07-27 21:36:53 Stole my neighbor from across the street’s jug of oil
907 2018-07-27 21:36:47 Uffff Midnight Oil. Uno de ellos se hizo político en Australia.
908 2018-07-27 21:36:44 I might have some extra peppermint oil (I use it for migraines) I could check and could meet ya on the west end tomorrow  if not most drug stores should have some essential oils of sorts
909 2018-07-27 21:36:36 Me: *calls my dad to say hi*

Dad: *doesnt day hi* “Have you checked your oil recently?”
910 2018-07-27 21:36:36 I know women admitting wrong is like oil and water; they don’t mix. So I expect that sort of answer.
911 2018-07-27 21:36:27 Getting an oil change will take up most of your day omg 
912 2018-07-27 21:36:27 I know, remember telling folk the Brits have killed for oil.
913 2018-07-27 21:36:20 No it smelled like something was burning like oil or something
914 2018-07-27 21:36:16 Never buying chicken there again cause last time i bought the oil taste old and was dripping like water from the chicken
915 2018-07-27 21:36:09 Brought my car for an oil change and this guy waiting for his car is hella snoring in here. 
916 2018-07-27 21:36:00 I wish they would legalise cannabis oil so I could use it to help me beat this cancer I have. It’s been legal in Amsterdam for many years and it’s not caused any problems there. It’s less toxic than the chemotherapy I am getting as well as being safer than someone getting drunk.
917 2018-07-27 21:35:54 Butter with one, olive oil on the other.  The way it should be :)
918 2018-07-27 21:35:51 @lisamurkowski 

Who’s the oil for?
919 2018-07-27 21:35:22 Mechanic installed gasket-filter, oil sensor this morning hopefully its good now. except truck wastes a lot more gas than car.
920 2018-07-27 21:35:16 One hundred percent oil industry trade ads for me!
921 2018-07-27 21:35:13 I just saw a product on Instagram called ‘organic panty liner oil’. I’m very confused.
922 2018-07-27 21:35:11 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!
923 2018-07-27 21:35:06 Don’t know where to get peppermint oil and no idea where the mouse came from just saw it in a pile of stuff in the back yard
924 2018-07-27 21:34:42 Did you know if you shave your legs with coconut oil , you don’t need lotion afterwards.. True Story

929 2018-07-27 21:34:02 Sure, I agree with you. It's the nature of capital. But Louisianians treat oil with a kind of sacredness, like, if only oil were doing well, our state would be fine. Oil will take care of us.
930 2018-07-27 21:33:55 Glad you are making new friends at the US Coast Guard. Do they know about your aggressive plans for off-shore oil drilling along our coast?
931 2018-07-27 21:33:54 This morning I was so excited to purchase an air fryer. I've saved for ot! Its going to be so healthy! No oil,no butter,right? Well-just spent the last 2 hours saving donut,grilled cheese,crispy chicken and cheese stick recipes on Pinterest. SMDH
932 2018-07-27 21:33:54 If you stuff the hole (I had holes last summer) with steel wool and put peppermint oil covered cotton balls all over it will drive them out
933 2018-07-27 21:33:50 It is legal everywhere. The only thing is the good CBD Oil is only available where Pot is legal due to the THC amount. Hemp is excellent, health wise. It just doesn’t give much in the lines of Pain Relief, at least not for me. 
Otherwise, Hemp is awesome, health wise.
934 2018-07-27 21:33:43 Finally  getting my oil change I'm 2 months late
935 2018-07-27 21:33:38 #dryas  A  brexit oil rig.

940 2018-07-27 21:33:19 paraben/sulfate tree shampoo and conditioner, leave in conditioner, coconut oil, using hair cleanser instead of shampoo every other wash!

942 2018-07-27 21:33:10 It's not a meme, I bought that gun oil and took a picture of it, also it is bacon scented. It's just clp solvent repackaged by a veteran owned and operated company that used it for a fund raiser.
943 2018-07-27 21:32:36 Math is hard. Pulled into the #bonneyville #esso and ask to prepay for 40 litres of fuel. Pump stops a litre short. Anyone know where to buy 2 stroke oil based on price instead of volume ratios??
944 2018-07-27 21:32:33 家出るギリギリまで勉強しようかな…
945 2018-07-27 21:32:31 I’ve never liked the “once wealthy” either because obv Caracazo and Chavez happened. But it was a country where not wealthy immigrants flocked & could thrive. The oil industry created a huge middle class. Things could be built & finished. It was more than just flush with money.

947 2018-07-27 21:32:16 The oil companies should pay for use or 25% of their gross.

955 2018-07-27 21:31:11 No they aren't. They just are bought by the oil industry!
956 2018-07-27 21:31:08 Left my coconut oil so now i have nothing to use.
957 2018-07-27 21:31:07 God I can’t wait to live in a country where I can buy an oil cart at any gas station...
958 2018-07-27 21:31:05 We can't say we don't deserve it. Endless tracts of forests replaced with palm oil, avocado, coffee, cocoa, meat farming.  #NetworkRail hacks down trees/scrub along it's tracks, woodland gone, replaced by housing, street trees felled. 

Mature trees protect us, we destroy them!

965 2018-07-27 21:30:13 Socialism fails only when the CIA is involved. That's why it succedes in Europe. Besides, the US military and police force ARE socialist programs. So are oil and gas subsidies and ag subsidies. Try giving all those up if you hate socialism so much.
966 2018-07-27 21:29:57 I know a lot of people that swear by CBD oil, I hope you can get some!!

976 2018-07-27 21:28:32 I’m very careful about the ones I go to/support, as I do think people will care more about, say, palm oil industry destruction if they can see an orangutan in person and connect with his/her individuality and being. But cruel zoos are destructive in many ways.

1002 2018-07-27 21:24:55 Ang manlilinlang sa akin gamit ang mababaw at fallacious na rason at pekeng pruweba ay iblo-block ko. Pero bago ang blocking, bibigyan ko muna ng lecture. Halimbawa:

"Taxation finances oil subsidy." 

Mali. Puwedeng gamitin ang Malampaya funds. Related sa energy ang oil subsidy.
1003 2018-07-27 21:24:48 He could waste billions of naira looking for oil in the north but he cannot complete a promising steel industry that will contribute significantly to the national economy.
1004 2018-07-27 21:24:44 It’s oil market every day business!

We're not talking about whether hes a liar or not. We're talking how Trump supposedly colluded with Russia, and you've yet to show me any evidence that proves he did.

I don't need a car I already have 2 bridges and a gallon of snake oil.

1035 2018-07-27 21:19:50 And furthermore, I would dare say that since the draft was eliminated we haven’t had a Soldier die that was defending a flag, a song or anything other than the business of oil! That is the real disgrace! That is the real injustice!
1036 2018-07-27 21:19:47 Got a free oil change tho
1037 2018-07-27 21:19:38 I am pretty sure that if this steel industry was to be in the north, baba Buhari would have completed it in his first year in office.
PMB spent/wasted billions of naira looking for oil in the north, the resources that is not available in the area of the North.

1044 2018-07-27 21:18:48 @itvchanneltv Why oh Why do you persist in calling Cannabis in CBD Oil for a DRUG or even a Medicine? It is a Natural Herb
1045 2018-07-27 21:18:42 His fingers sleepily traced along the vial of jasmine-scented oil. Every summer, he is peacefulness.
1046 2018-07-27 21:18:41 Psst! We will discuss this at the next Bilderberger meeting in the “Big Oil” conference session.
1047 2018-07-27 21:18:38 At least we can agree on something: Susana mismanaged PERA and ERA and NM is too reliant on oil and gas... something both @Pearce4NM and @Gov_Martinez have a hard time admitting as they receive thousands of dollars in contributions from oil and gas.
1048 2018-07-27 21:18:37 @charliekirk11 Can you and your time machine buddy @DineshDSouza please have a discussion about todays Republican party instead of a time when slipping in horse shit or buying whale oil to light your house was a daily issue?
1049 2018-07-27 21:18:18 Oh ok I use coconut oil & a few drops of peppermint oil.
1050 2018-07-27 21:18:01 5) I heard on Edible Acres' YouTube channel (a perennial plant permaculture nursery) that they have success protecting their seed-starting coldframes from voles by mixing castor oil with some kind of dish detergent, then applying it to the base of the coldframes.

1051 2018-07-27 21:17:56 Just saw a freight train running parallel to my route home from work. It was pulling an oil tank. Spray-painted in big red letters on the side of said oil tank was, “BOB VOTED 4 HILLARY.” 



Thanks, Bob!

1059 2018-07-27 21:17:28 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head. 
1060 2018-07-27 21:17:25 when i worked @ a place w a rock wall and we had an event where all the ppl with cushy oil company jobs came, not 1 or 2 but THREE different ppl said "look at the lil monkey" and made "ooh ooh ah ah" noises while their children climbed it and it still haunts me years later
1061 2018-07-27 21:17:21 Now that I’m 18 and going to college soon
My mom made me get a vaccine shot by MYSELF 
My dad made me get an oil change by MYSELF

It was scary at first cuz idk what to do or say but people/workers are nice, it wasn’t that bad 
1062 2018-07-27 21:17:07 I have really problematic, hormonal skin and was super nervous the coconut oil in this foundation would break me out but it hasn't at all. It feels lovely and light to wear and the colour and coverage is amazing. I recommend 
1063 2018-07-27 21:17:06 It goes from "nowhere" to "nowhere". 

1. Starts around Ajaokuta - could have been linked up to Abuja, but it is not.
2. Quite close to Ontisha & Benin, but doesn't link either town.
3. Terminates in Warri, but the port is barely functional

Typical Oil Boom era planning.
1064 2018-07-27 21:16:53 SPAM ME WITH CBD OIL BENEFITS... NO LINKS...especially if you dont have pain ..what else IS IT GOOD FOR

1067 2018-07-27 21:16:26 Is Trump trying to drive up price of oil?

1069 2018-07-27 21:16:16 Mfs need to hurry up with my oil change 
1070 2018-07-27 21:16:14 I want to know when I can get my Tachikoma. I've already stocked up on mineral oil and everything.
1071 2018-07-27 21:15:49 Lol I remember queueing at petrol stations with my dad during the oil crisis, I loved the three day week and the power cuts - eating your tea by candle light was cool for a kid. And Summer 76 was the best

1074 2018-07-27 21:15:20 People are forever seeing videos of cute kids & jumping to “time to get a baby” Like, you can’t just buy a kid & set it down somewhere to be cute. You gotta water it, take it outside, clean it, change it’s oil, brush it, make sure it gets plenty of sunlight. It’s a lot of work.
1075 2018-07-27 21:15:16 Are these oil paintings or is that just your art style? Either way keep up the fantastic work.
1076 2018-07-27 21:15:03 Exciting News!  The new AWTY Compass iOS nav app is currently beta testing in the Bakken with major oil producers and logistics groups.  We're excited to launch this long-awaited version for our patient customers and friends of AWTY!!  Stay Tuned!
1077 2018-07-27 21:15:01 What does the plastic production source distribution looks like? How much of it is made from oil? What are alternative sources?
1078 2018-07-27 21:14:58 went in for an oil change for my prius and the mechanic cut $10 off the original price because my “‘awesome prius!’ said no one ever” bumper sticker made him laugh 
1079 2018-07-27 21:14:50 .If elite parasites don't have their corporations poison all the wells, how will they ever transition from oil based economy to water based economy?
1080 2018-07-27 21:14:47 I'm looking hesitantly forward to seeing how the Middle East is going to handle the collapse of oil. Its gonna happen. These countries need to get a serious economy going. Oil is going to collapse. There is massive change going on
Elon Musk has made the largest factories on Earth
1081 2018-07-27 21:14:21 I got a new oil... man listen
1082 2018-07-27 21:13:41 I cannot; I did the reserch offline years ago but it was primarily from Health Canada. The easiest thing to find is that corn is one of the top 7 fatal food allergens, but it gets less press as it usually requires direct contact and doesn't leave oil residue on everything touched
1083 2018-07-27 21:13:34 Why I can justify spending six dollars on a coffee twice a day or $50 on a clock but not $30 on an oil change is beyond me
1084 2018-07-27 21:13:21 I'm off oil for a bit, I'll break the fast at curveball and get obliterated 
1085 2018-07-27 21:12:44 I've met it with challenges; but, God has shown himself strong. Free oil change & free lunch has really made up for the difficulty.
1086 2018-07-27 21:12:16 eh iya kmrn dokter e jg blg gt sih try, tp ini cb pke obat gatel rada mendingan, ap ku hrus cb beli olive oil yak merk ap apik e try?

1088 2018-07-27 21:12:10 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
1089 2018-07-27 21:11:50 @Donjazzy does your feet smell like hot oil
1090 2018-07-27 21:11:47 He's getting pain killers for a week (one more day) and then I'll see how he does. Other than that they both get hemp oil on their licky licks. It should help joints etc and their fur got even shinier and softer than it already was.
1091 2018-07-27 21:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1092 2018-07-27 21:11:29 That is the main reason why Libya was not allowed to develop since 2012. Its oil reserves, its potential for tourism, its geographical location and more moderate climate compared to some other Arab countries, could have made it a very prosperous hub.
1093 2018-07-27 21:11:07 Proverbs are the palm oil we use to eat yam
1094 2018-07-27 21:10:39 What the fuck even is that, is olive oil not universal
1095 2018-07-27 21:10:28 At the moment the hot flushes seemed to have passed but my god the itchy skin is literally driving me crazy! I have more moisturisers than food in my fridge, more antihistamines than Boots, coconut oil, African black soap & still I itch 
1096 2018-07-27 21:10:26 *olive oil

1100 2018-07-27 21:10:11 And in the case of the oil industry, they have a scapegoat- green energy. Since that will be the cause of some of the job loss, why not blame it all on that?
1101 2018-07-27 21:10:10 Totally. Mostly Palm oil.

1103 2018-07-27 21:09:48 The US is the arsenal and enforcer of Rothschild Inc. foreign policy, which is to seize the world’s resources and make them its own. The Rothschilds won’t forget how their puppet Shah was deposed and they lost their Persian oil holdings in 1979. They hold grudges & desire revenge
1104 2018-07-27 21:09:27 What a day! Stopped in @goodyear for oil change and rotate tires. And the saga began! Bubble on tire. Under warranty, yes. No worries, wrong. Warranty company, being a pain. Been waiting 4 hours. Grrrr! Update to come, soon I hope. #REALLYREALLY

1109 2018-07-27 21:08:06 it’s near the olive oil mister i think
1110 2018-07-27 21:08:03 Yup. Although both saudi arabia and Iran have oil and both are big countries, the Saudis live a way better life than Iranians.. and that's all because of the governments and how they spend their money.

Ours spend it on the people, they build things for us, they make jobs for us.
1111 2018-07-27 21:08:02 I’m traveling to 6 continents &  22 countries from August 24-April 30. When I return I am going to be administering the 72-day cancer cure I learned from Bozidar Radisic ( my mentor in this matter) in Slovenia in 2016. Just the wholesale cost of the 60 grams of pure oil required.
1112 2018-07-27 21:08:02 The whole "lower service" thing is overblown...

Brakes shouldn't need touching but once in 200K miles on a normal car.  Oil changes cost $25 twice a year.

Neither are serious costs.  Further, few buying a Tesla is keeping it to 200K miles anyway, but that is a side point.
1113 2018-07-27 21:07:42 everybody wants to rule the world
1114 2018-07-27 21:07:28 Wow CBD oil is a lifesaver! My stomach and back instantly feel better!

1116 2018-07-27 21:07:06 I got new tires, an oil change, new air filter, and windshield wipers. All i went in there for was tires 
1117 2018-07-27 21:07:01 So this is great except where I am, we can no longer hook up to gas due to overcapacity. So what can a homeowner who can't use gas do? Propane is really expensive. I heat with oil and hot water is electric. Would like something else...what can I do?
1118 2018-07-27 21:06:56 Oil can, impressive.
1119 2018-07-27 21:06:25 The liberal agenda,,,, we want more money, then it will work... it needs more money, then it will work... socialism in rich Venezuela with its oil needed more money, and then it would have worked.... smh
1120 2018-07-27 21:06:24 Don’t know what a career spender is John , but I do know all big oil companies spend billions on R&D . Can you expand on that
1121 2018-07-27 21:06:22 CBD oil or cannabis.
1122 2018-07-27 21:06:20 Preme u rocking with coconut oil? Been trying that’s but might make the transition to grape seed oil
1123 2018-07-27 21:06:20   Take the Oil. Remember hearing that? Well guess what? Trump took the Nukes. North Korea is now Trump's military base to keep China in check.  @Education4Libs
1124 2018-07-27 21:06:08 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
1125 2018-07-27 21:05:51 Ano nman ang kinalaman ng mga OFW sa pagbaba ng pISO? Pag aari ba at kontrolado ng OFW ang Dollar at oil price? Ang mga OFW nag ttrabaho ng marangal para sa pamilya at the same time dahil sa remittance natutulungan ang gobyerno. hindi nmin kailangan nag pagkilala mo idiot.
1126 2018-07-27 21:05:42 Trump is nothing but a snake oil salesman.
1127 2018-07-27 21:05:28 Obviously paid by oil city representatives to pretend city are renowned worldwide, then cheers for the club who IS actually renowned worldwide! City will never be a big club 
1128 2018-07-27 21:05:27   Take the Oil. Remember hearing that? Well guess what? Trump took the Nukes. North Korea just turned into Trump's military base to keep China in check.

1133 2018-07-27 21:04:41 She is mentally ill for gods sake - compassion @MeghanMcCain.? Quit putting snake oil salesmen at the head of your party and you’ll quit attracting people with severe mental health issues
1134 2018-07-27 21:04:37 watching my essential oil diffuser..."man this shit vapes CLOUDS bro"
1135 2018-07-27 21:04:36 Half-melted bakelite phones stream out from the fissure beneath her, as pages from the Modification of Final Judgment float up into the air and then burst into flames.

"WHY DO YOU NOT WELCOME ME BACK MORTALS? SURELY I AND MY BROTHER, THE STANDARD OF OIL, CAN SERVE YOUR NEEDS."
1136 2018-07-27 21:04:27 Hand made bath bomb donuts, sold in lots of 5, 5.00 each, 10 or more 4.00 each, can retail for as much as 13.00 each, great to sell at flea markets.  We can make them with any essential oil you choose.

1138 2018-07-27 21:03:49 I’m getting my oil changed but I am down after.
1139 2018-07-27 21:03:49 Someone get me an oil rig for my birthday
1140 2018-07-27 21:03:45 First time I've gone out in the sun for this heat wave I was only out there 2 hours with this baby oil on and I've gone black  ffs man
1141 2018-07-27 21:03:44 I don't blame your daughter for thinking such, those oil paintings are superb
1142 2018-07-27 21:03:30 The oil cleanse! 
1143 2018-07-27 21:03:10 What a cracking Summer that was - etched into my memory - Kikki Dee and Elton John and lashings of coconut oil from the chemist in a 15p jar to literally fry us - before we were a bit more aware. I'm going out to have a niff now that you've said that.
1144 2018-07-27 21:03:03 Planned to cut the grass but I can’t get the oil dipstick out on my new lawnmower.... back to sitting on the couch
1145 2018-07-27 21:02:56 the soybean oil is AMAZING. it's perfect flavour in a salad dressing
1146 2018-07-27 21:02:56 So does someone the Kremlin owns 1) bitch at NATO members to fully fund their militaries to act as a bulwark to Russia 2) authorize Javelin missiles to Ukraine 3) jawbone OPEC & have US energy policy to lower oil prices which nails Russian economy 4) Kill Russian “mercs” in Syria

1149 2018-07-27 21:01:34 @thataylaa please review It cosmetics cc oil free matte cream (foundation). Does it work on dry skin? I’m super dry afraid of anything that says matte.
1150 2018-07-27 21:01:28 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
1151 2018-07-27 21:01:26 Chuck Norris once had an erection while lying face down and struck oil.
1152 2018-07-27 21:01:17 I had a geology professor in college who ended every single lecture with a new news article about citizens somewhere having to pay for drinking water. He said that in our lifetimes, fresh water would become a more precious commodity than oil.
1153 2018-07-27 21:01:14 Well, I recently had a baby fricasseed in oil, over easy

A baby chicken that is

1155 2018-07-27 21:01:01 You're quoting a lie though. If we put in less than we take out why is our tax taken and only around 48% given back (excluding oil and gas revenue)? There's zero evidence of a single penny of English tax crossing the border for anything other than the unwanted trident WMD.
1156 2018-07-27 21:01:01 Cannabis Oil has very important uses. But then again I can understand why folk are having a go at Accies, they’re all fucking idiots with no clue and need to remember it’s the 21st century.

1158 2018-07-27 21:00:55 I’ll be at Lucas Oil Raceway Park on September 7th in the No. 55, then back in the 15 for the season finale at Kansas.
1159 2018-07-27 21:00:34 July 27, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1160 2018-07-27 21:00:30 $100 just to get my oil changed  the devil is a lie i will take my car elsewhere
1161 2018-07-27 21:00:22 Ushering you into the snake oil business early on. How cute.
1162 2018-07-27 21:00:14 I watched Captain Planet. My dad, grandfather, etc all worked in oil. They were the "bad guys". You know what Captain Planet taught me about? Recycling and why I should do it. That was my big take away. I somehow didn't think that people who worked in oil were evil.
1163 2018-07-27 21:00:06 It benefits special interests exclusively - oil, gas, and industry at the expense of people, wildlife, and the planet. And Gym Jordan has zero principles, just like the rest of your lying, cheating party.
1164 2018-07-27 21:00:03 The @USNavy’s mams oil of man Admiral, Alene Duerk tits said: “It was a spume fluting to hot milk, and to be recognized as the tits, but I unwanted to bandage jazz that I misused that notoriety to do as jerk yams as I could.” Alene did unjust that, and America is forever..
1165 2018-07-27 21:00:02 No, it means low wage,  no benefits non secure jobs. Especially since your SC pick Gorsuch just gave us the Janus decision which will devastate working people. You're selling snake oil & everyone WH can think 4 themselves knows it.
1166 2018-07-27 21:00:00 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
1167 2018-07-27 20:59:46 I keep peppermint oil on me.  For some reason breathing it in and rubbing it on my pressure points (wrists and temples).  It helps so much
1168 2018-07-27 20:59:43 No way. She started out making lots of nasty comments about the oil sands and the energy sector.  It’s taken her a while to realize what the bread and butter of the Alberta economy is.
1169 2018-07-27 20:59:37 I want oil paints and @jbsullivan17 ‘s 
1170 2018-07-27 20:59:20 Ditto on the #CBD oil. Major lifesaver for a variety of things with no side effects or pharmacological complications. 

Be careful what you buy. Charlottes's Web has been the best and most professional one I have found so far.
1171 2018-07-27 20:59:11 Sure a more aggressively liberal model has dominated since the 1970s oil crisis but I think it's important to note the discrepancy. America's so called golden period was also its most economically redistributive.
1172 2018-07-27 20:59:10 My skin life has been awesome every since I switched to 100% olive oil. Head to toe 
1173 2018-07-27 20:59:09 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
1174 2018-07-27 20:58:32 At least that’s a good smelling way to go. My flat mate set our flat on fire deep frying sweet potato and it smelled like vegetable oil and bitterness for three months
1175 2018-07-27 20:58:17 My Husband is drinking only mineral water from glass bottles. Pumpkin seeds and oil are good for a high  testosterone level.
1176 2018-07-27 20:57:49 So it's OK to subsidize oil companies. Why don't you call the oil companies parasites?
1177 2018-07-27 20:57:32 Coconut oil is the key the only way I can comb out my hair lol
1178 2018-07-27 20:57:20 Must use some olive oil  or vyzalin
1179 2018-07-27 20:57:18 also im so fuckin upset with my cast iron situation that im reseasoning it, but my ovens not a self-clean so i hope it just takes the layer of oil i rubbed on without too much of a problem
1180 2018-07-27 20:57:15 I got a raise while being on maternity leave lol... this is why I work in oil and gas. 
1181 2018-07-27 20:57:05 I was just about to bring up coal rolling. I've had people intentionally blow smoke on my Prius because I dared to drive one in "oil country". I hate these assholes.
1182 2018-07-27 20:56:51 There's already oil wells all over the UK and you don't see any of them because you only see what you want to see
1183 2018-07-27 20:56:50 Below 26 on oil ...will take up to 24 months to unfold
1184 2018-07-27 20:56:50 *kicks open saloon door* They stuck oil on old McPherson's ranch I need 10 men with good hands right now!
1185 2018-07-27 20:56:48 Bayleigh’s suggestion of mixing coconut and olive oil for her deep conditioner. Try it.
1186 2018-07-27 20:56:35 2.5 hours for oil change after being quoted 1.5 hours. And I still don’t have vehicle. Y’all got to do better than this. @NissanMcKinney 
1187 2018-07-27 20:56:29 I’m thinking something with baby oil 
1188 2018-07-27 20:56:03 I smell like sweat, ass, oil, grease, garbage, and box
1189 2018-07-27 20:55:49 Good news: I found a shop that works on imports in our new city
Bad news: ofc they're busy, so there was a wait & they couldn't get to everything
Good news: I did get my oil changed & an appt. for the rest
Bad(?) news: Ernie, who worked on my car, believes the gov't is after him
1190 2018-07-27 20:55:36 13% has not helped oil states, the state r still undeveloped, it is stolen by their leaders who sponsor militancy with it.
1191 2018-07-27 20:55:30 You serve the guns & oil cartel of the Russian, US, North Korea & Syria alliance.
1192 2018-07-27 20:55:30 cc: @Oil_Guns_Merica Lookin' out for ya, bud.
1193 2018-07-27 20:55:27 Lavender essential oil and breath it in or rub it on your wrist!
1194 2018-07-27 20:55:19 I'm sorry I didn't respond appropriately to your well-meant but cliché-ridden pat on the head. I realise it has worked for you in the past on stray dogs so you are feeling shocked, but in future, before dispensing platitudes like cod-liver oil, try asking a few questions first.
1195 2018-07-27 20:55:13 I can never get the oil all worked in properly, even once i get the stir going. Tastes like peanut flavored chalk.
1196 2018-07-27 20:54:52 Perhaps he's advising you to cook food using coconut oil rather than vegetable oil because it has less calories, not eating it directly. I use a coconut oil spray, which is supposed to be even less calories, which I got from Sainbury's.
1197 2018-07-27 20:54:47 Yeah, okay Amarjeet.  Canada will be the biggest embarrassment when we still sell our oil for so cheap.  Let's not forget paying off Kinder Morgan's debt and purchasing a shitty pipeline.  #idiocy
1198 2018-07-27 20:54:46 Alright maybe not the best read, but go to Home Depot and get Neem Oil. Least toxic, derived from a plant in nature.
1199 2018-07-27 20:54:25 *Brings in oil and towel* pls lie down here 
1200 2018-07-27 20:54:02 Norway socialist policies saved their oil money rather than giving the money to the rich in tax breaks now has TRILLIONS saved for the people.
High taxes but low cost housing free education no private schools. And they have a much better life
1201 2018-07-27 20:53:58 Replace them with packets of cayenne pepper oil
1202 2018-07-27 20:53:37 Getting ahead of the oil boom
1203 2018-07-27 20:53:36 ig stans and twitter stans are like oil and water, they don’t mix
1204 2018-07-27 20:53:03 Also thank you for endorsing a no-stir peanut butter. I just cannot with the oil ones.
1205 2018-07-27 20:52:58 already use tee tree oil :/
1206 2018-07-27 20:52:55 how much of Venezuela's problems come from American interference and embargos? How much comes from CIA interference? How much comes from tying its economy so tightly to oil commodities? How much comes from its political class and mismanagement?
1207 2018-07-27 20:52:44 Burning the midnight oil to complete a complex pensions equalisation report, at least it is cooler now!!
1208 2018-07-27 20:52:38 What do I do on my days off?

Change oil. What else?
1209 2018-07-27 20:52:38 I need an oil defuser, tryna get zen in my room.
1210 2018-07-27 20:52:18 Ok general public, the service engine soon light on your GM product doesn’t mean change oil. It means you need to get your shit checked!
1211 2018-07-27 20:52:15 Afgan oil is good, not just for beards can be used on all hair.
1212 2018-07-27 20:51:48 The new investment into the oil sands has been hampered by her carbon taxing and her social license crap. It was only when she at least seemed to be fighting for the pipeline that I have found her even tolerable.
1213 2018-07-27 20:51:28 Yes I do. I think if the demand for palm oil was not there no more land would be cleared. It is not the demand for PKE that's driving the destruction of rainforest. Stopping NZ imports will only reduce the price for other users or result in big piles of rotting PKE = No change
1214 2018-07-27 20:51:25 Attention clients!

We are currently out of stock and awaiting another shipment of cbd oil.

Petanicals is quite backordered at this time. We appreciate everyone's patience.
1215 2018-07-27 20:51:24 *feels despressed out of the blue* 
*does research*
*finds out high doses of tea tree oil can cause depressive behavior* 

I must live with my mistake . Next time I'll just wash my shorts normally.
1216 2018-07-27 20:51:22 Finally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t admit to a little help on the inside. Everyday, I take fish oil, zinc, turmeric, and b complex vitamins. Getchu some.
1217 2018-07-27 20:51:12 I would imagine you could use any oil as long as you pay attention to the smoke point.
1218 2018-07-27 20:51:06 portuguese olive oil is the best olive oil. don’t @ me
1219 2018-07-27 20:50:51 But not U.S. debate on what to do about it and, more importantly, real actions taken to mitigate it & liberate the EU from dependence on Russian Oil & Gas. Instead, the threat of a trade war & NATO increases in defense spending means more Gas imports from the U.S. to the EU. Win!
1220 2018-07-27 20:50:51 Got my 8th house oil in Aquarius! I’m good to manifest and transform for the rest of the year. I love how @theafromystic has managed to turn this into such a hot commodity.

1229 2018-07-27 20:50:04 Every time I get my oil changed I just get reallllllll nervous that they’re gonna come outside to tell me something else is wrong with my car.
1230 2018-07-27 20:50:02 Was it Buhari that disrupted the oil price?
Was it Buhari that depleted our foreign reserves?
Was it Buhari that made the Nigerian economy dependent on oil?
Was it Buhari that prevented Nigeria from saving during the oil boom?

1242 2018-07-27 20:48:30 I feel terrible  for the farmers , But the ones that voted for Trump are getting exactly what they voted for a total collapse of free trade . Hey what did you expect from a snake oil salesmen & Con Artist ,the party is over time to pay the devil his due

I'm starting to get pimples again
1245 2018-07-27 20:48:16 1) Oil Pulling
Put one table spoon of coconut oil into your mouth and swish it through your teeth.
Pull it for around 15-20 minutes.
1246 2018-07-27 20:48:12 I just ate a pretzel and it tasted like swallowing ocean water and chasing that with a cup of oil. #OhioStateFair
1247 2018-07-27 20:48:11 Got some absolutely amazing Ajishima Seto Fumi Furikake Seasoning to sprinkle on my rice along with some sesame oil and this stuff is AMAZING. Can't believe I picked it up for like 2 bucks at @WalmartCanada 
What a beautiful diverse country we live in 
1248 2018-07-27 20:47:59 Plus, tattoos like that (oil painting looking) almost always end up looking terrible once they heal.

1250 2018-07-27 20:47:45 Evening primrose oil tablet, peppermint and ginger tea with honey (no sugar), drink lots of water, and a heat patch should sort you out 
1251 2018-07-27 20:47:19 WHO ARE WE?

Zenek Energy Limited is an indigenous fast growing company. We are into supply, marketing distribution and transportation of oil products across Nigeria.
1252 2018-07-27 20:47:12 This is not as facetious as it sounds, I swear, but maybe putting it in rice or something else absorbent? I would worry that baking the oil out of it would take a while and be too much exposure to heat.
1253 2018-07-27 20:47:07 I love my oil change guys they’re always so sweet and explain every little thing to me cause idk shit about cars.
1254 2018-07-27 20:47:04 My dad is going thru a diet-obsessed phase and he keeps telling me to eat a shit ton of coconut oil and I have no idea why
1255 2018-07-27 20:46:33 Are surfboards made from a byproduct of oil?

1258 2018-07-27 20:46:19 You do NOT put oil in with the pasta while it’s boiling.  It coats the pasta and makes the sauce slide off.  I’ve had shouting matches with my husband over this.
1259 2018-07-27 20:46:11 #MillennialDream to rent a place with my own garage so I can do my own oil changes & not deal with city mechanics anymore.
1260 2018-07-27 20:46:09 Learned how to change oil today I feel like I’ve accomplished something lol
1261 2018-07-27 20:45:58 as soon as my direct deposit hits i get a speeding ticket and my oil change light pops on
1262 2018-07-27 20:45:46 Combine 1 cup baked Alaska with 1 pound kingfish. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve on bread
1263 2018-07-27 20:45:21 Rambo I think. Lot of oil there. Pretty hot. Jamie’s made we feel weak, so hot.
1264 2018-07-27 20:45:08 In the build up to indyref2. @BBCScotlandNews will scream at us:

1) The Russian army is on the brink of invading Auchterarder 
2) The value of oil per barrel will be one toenail 
3) Pensioners will be forced to become chimney sweeps
1265 2018-07-27 20:45:05 BRUSH/FLOSS and get REGULAR OIL CHANGES! This is always my advice to poor people. Fixing teeth and cars is expensive.
1266 2018-07-27 20:45:04 One of my favorite memories this summer was when @Horn73Horn lathered up in baby oil at Zoombezi bay & literally looked like a greasy hotdog
1267 2018-07-27 20:45:00 She corrected herself in a split second, no time
1268 2018-07-27 20:44:59 @UFIP_fr @BofAML says "crude oil prices suffered a major correction this week on renewed demand and supply fears. The likely return of Libyan barrels kicked off some selling pressure and trade war fears did the rest"
1269 2018-07-27 20:44:54 I though I could attempt*** to maybe do an oil change on my car myself. But, then I went on YouTube. I stopped after the 1st minute and I’m like yeah I give up already

Wow Rey, this is a very inconvenient time.

1278 2018-07-27 20:43:31 Aphids don't like peppermint, so make some tea and get spraying or make a nice mint concoction in a watering can if you have any in the garden. Or a few drops of mint essential oil in a spray could work? I don't like killing owt, so I just hose them off until they give up and go.
1279 2018-07-27 20:43:30 Yeah, I know. My point was that their citizens don't pay any income tax (because the royal oil money funds everything), so they're about the only industrialized nation who pays less tax than Americans.

1288 2018-07-27 20:42:39 That’s the average American. Imagine my college professor, who would probably be more educated than the average assumed I’m from Qatar because my name is Qirat and asked me to give my input on oil and the economy. Told him I didn’t know what he was talking about tho I did.
1289 2018-07-27 20:42:26 Only been on twitter for 2 weeks. I'm going to start a you tube channel dealing with a lot nerd stuff. Wanted to start building my base now. Right now I'm really into oil pastel art and learning to use art programs on my computer.

1296 2018-07-27 20:41:29 As we’re used to regular rainfall, materials such as oil and rubber are washed away from roads, however during hot, dry weather these oils stay on the road surface and leave them greasier after rain - this means less friction and difficult driving conditions, stay safe! ^Lloyd

1337 2018-07-27 20:34:54 Unfortunately, few if any long term jobs. Most financial benefits of pipeline will go to Big Oil.
1338 2018-07-27 20:34:45 I have a more bizarre theory; that big oil finances climate denial so the ice caps will melt and they can now get at the oil underneath.

1378 2018-07-27 20:29:21 First, overall investment dropped by roughly equivalent percentages in Canada and the US.

1379 2018-07-27 20:29:02 Doubtful. Social Democracy would support policies such as taxing the obsolete and quickly-becoming-unprofitable coal and oil industries while subsidizing wind and solar. Outright environmentalism is not socialism, either, so you don't need the pure market justification.

Absent a revolution, our western society and worldview is going to cook all of us by burning oil at an ever-increasing rate as we defile Indigenous land and acidify the oceans...

1427 2018-07-27 20:23:06 Bedtime #SkinSin: dirty pillowcase. 

Over time your pillowcase collects oil and bacteria from your skin and hair. This can lead to clogged pores, breakouts and inflammation. Try washing or changing your pillowcase once a week to avoid these problems.

1431 2018-07-27 20:22:25 The issue is that dependence upon oil alone to meet our ongoing energy needs is reckless.  We have to develop alternatives.  I am so glad you are supporting  #Tesla.  I wish I could do more.

The market for the byproduct supports the economics for the primary product. And despite there being 'sustainable palm oil' it's not particularly. It also signals the sustainability, or lack thereof, of the milk farming practices.

1525 2018-07-27 20:09:53 Most of the universe is very cold and dimly lit, containing nothing of value. Any sentient conscious being can determine value. But humans value things without intrinsic value, i.e. money, gold, oil, diamonds. Rarest thing in the universe is another's conscious intelligent life.

1527 2018-07-27 20:09:46 Interesting concept. Another example of this, though not here in the US, is the way Norway manages its oil resource/revenues.
1528 2018-07-27 20:09:42 Shareholders own the oil companies. They are run by people whose first duty is to return funds on capital. Most companies also work hard to please their stakeholders (customers, employees, government, local communities etc)
It is far from perfect and very far from broken.

1546 2018-07-27 20:06:55 Just goes to show you how well the US backdoor propaganda machine worked and how gullible misdirected enviro clan are. I guess it’s ok to buy from countries with no enviro standards and no human rights but their own country can’t sell its oil. Pure idiocy!
1547 2018-07-27 20:06:48 We helped develop the oil industry in Venezuela . They didn’t have the capabilities that our oil industry has to turn it into a huge source of wealth. They profited and we profited. That’s capitalism.
1548 2018-07-27 20:06:34 Just out here working in this dam heat lol, loaded up my truck and now I'm waiting for the call from the rig to head out, most likely will be working through the night. Typical oil field work lmmfao 
1549 2018-07-27 20:06:31 yes, but not much. doing oil cleansing method did help a lot when transitioning, and then i tone my skin with raw acv, diluted of course. i hope it works on you, given that every person's skin type is different.
1550 2018-07-27 20:06:30 What could be more worth it ?  Clean coal or nice nukes.  Oil.
1551 2018-07-27 20:06:22 I do love my new keyring 

I just wish he'd wash me a bit more often. And maybe clean my seats. I could probably use some oil, too. Grumble, grumble.
1552 2018-07-27 20:06:17 CBD oil helps. Find a good therapist to talk to. Stay away from tv news. Learn what your triggers are.
1553 2018-07-27 20:06:09 Did a Fiat lose some oil?
1554 2018-07-27 20:06:02 Get me job in the oil field tired of partying
1555 2018-07-27 20:05:51 #Weird ,  people use chemically treated cooking oil to prepare their fully organic dishes. *hmm*
1556 2018-07-27 20:05:47 No, I’m saying that the folks critical of the Jones Act make it harder for the companies ordering ships to get financing. Every time guys like you get paid by big oil to write factless political white papers it makes it harder for them to get financing.
1557 2018-07-27 20:05:40 Use some Jamaican Black Castor Oil, HairFinity and Shea Moisture Shampoo & Conditioner. OMG!
1558 2018-07-27 20:05:24 Even better with chilli flakes and chilli oil.  Prezzo can't do spicy pizzas no matter how hard it try. At least your team aren't afraid of putting a bit of fire on a pizza!
1559 2018-07-27 20:05:13 Trust me, it would. Throw there a bunch of mayonnaise, olive oil and a fatty piece of fish
1560 2018-07-27 20:05:11 I lived through Hurricane Sandy on Long Island.  Fuel shortages developed when oil tankers could not deliver oil because the ports were flooded.  Waiting 3 hours for 5 gal of gas is not fun.
1561 2018-07-27 20:05:05 Who votes for pro style oil wrestling? 
1562 2018-07-27 20:04:41 Very majestic! I saw this pic but didn't know it was at Oil Creek. My memories of being in the boat with Dad there are 1) Tam, be quiet! 2) Tam, you're hung up again?! Mmm, mmmm, mmmmmm3)the beavers and their dams 4) the remoteness and hidden beauty 5) water like glass
1563 2018-07-27 20:04:32 Took my car to get an oil change

Mechanic: We need to replace your battery. We don’t want you breaking down on your way home. It’ll be $250.
Me: Can I call my husband? 
Mechanic: Is he mechanically inclined? 
Me: Yes.
Mechanic: Ok, have him just clean the battery.
Me: 
1564 2018-07-27 20:04:29 my guy, you’re about to dehydrate in your vehicle ... but at least you got your oil changed huh? :/
1565 2018-07-27 20:03:35 Look like Germany support India to buy Iranian oil and German government  thinking about only profit not human right
1566 2018-07-27 20:03:28 I now need two blotting papers to completely remove the oil from my face instead of one what a time to be alive
1567 2018-07-27 20:03:25 While my dog accepts your apology, 45 and his cult .. and I mean cult have an aversion to truth! Snake oil salesmen!
1568 2018-07-27 20:03:24 TEA TREE OIL!!!!!
1569 2018-07-27 20:03:16 My dogs really love them some coconut oil. They chase me around the house like I’ve fucking marinated myself
1570 2018-07-27 20:03:12 It might be possible. I've been in contact with a furry who works at Honda saying the oil filter I've used has known leaking issues
1571 2018-07-27 20:03:04 Do you need an oil change Zack?
1572 2018-07-27 20:02:56 Give me an example of how the US pillaged Venezuela or Nicaragua or Cuba
In each case it seems like the rich elites & their own greedy dictators did the pillaging. Venezuela was once a fairly wealthy oil-rich country. We didn’t “pillage” their oil. They made big money selling it
1573 2018-07-27 20:02:48 Spending two weeks on a diet which consists mainly of salad, red wine, olive oil and strong lager plays merry hell with the digestion of chaps of a certain age. My arse has been wiped more times than Garry Glitter's hard drive.
1574 2018-07-27 20:02:44 My truck has 30,000 miles on it and i just got an oil change, they put a sticker on my dash what say next oil change at 57,000 miles. Now I’m no mechanic but someone math is very wrong
1575 2018-07-27 20:02:44 The car is due for the second oil change this trip. #SignsYourVacationIsTooLong @HappyHourTags

Royalties from oil and mineral reserves are sent to London.

London then sends SOME of it back to us.

1582 2018-07-27 20:01:31 i tried to grind some pepper and the thing fell off and dumped the whole bottle of unground peppercorns into my 2 boxes of pasta and $3 worth of olive oil dish for a family gathering
so that's how my day is going
1583 2018-07-27 20:01:08 Las gomitas se bañaron en gas oil 
1584 2018-07-27 20:00:58 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 07/23/18, net long 610,471; change of 20,823 or 3.30% down from prev. 631,294; 82.60% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
1585 2018-07-27 20:00:54 “Citi bike taking up parking spaces has been a smart use of space” From the guy who got laughed out of court trying to sue big oil. So what do drivers do when they can’t find parking? That is right - they keep driving looking for a space. Seems counterintuitive to the Mayors goal
1586 2018-07-27 20:00:40 The best way to ensure that there are “tons of jet fuel” around and that there is any “big oil” left to support an industry upon is to develop alternative energy sources now - before a crisis.

1590 2018-07-27 20:00:36 gotta cut vegetable oil. no bueno
1591 2018-07-27 20:00:35 Well some already pointed out that our FR has almost doubled so that could be one of the places the oil money is being saved up.
Still doesn't take away anything from the point I was trying to put across. Buhari administration began with one of the biggest crude oil crashes.
1592 2018-07-27 20:00:20 Oil spills suck also. I've written about those as well.
1593 2018-07-27 20:00:17 Sex and castor oil - desperate times call for desperate measures.
1594 2018-07-27 20:00:12 did that question need be asked. Of course the US wants regime collapse in Iran. That's the last super power in middle east

1598 2018-07-27 19:59:41 Saw this mk5 that would have been really nice until I smelled all the oil they were burning as they tried to take off infront of me.
1599 2018-07-27 19:59:27 On a childhood family vacation, I almost choked to death on a mixture of egg yolks, oil, water and vinegar.  Just lucky we happened to be near the Mayo Clinic.

1603 2018-07-27 19:58:40 Oil & Gas went up b/c we sell to highest worldwide bidder with no break for US consumers. It is our natural resource yet we pay same price per bbl or cubic foot that non-producing country pays. Goofy.
1604 2018-07-27 19:58:32 moisturizing my body with hiprose oil twice a day has become my new form of self love
1605 2018-07-27 19:58:22 LOL, so naked shorting does not force weak buyers or motivated sellers to capitulate?  Ask any farmer, miner, or driller.  The boyz start driving down price and they have to follow to protect production prices.  Remember oil a few years back?Ever read Wizard of Oz?

1607 2018-07-27 19:58:13 Tomorrow I'm doing my hair, getting an oil change on this car and I'm finding somewhere to go for a couple hours
1608 2018-07-27 19:57:58 Every player should stand. The National Anthem is not the problem. I thought social justice was.  The two are as different as oil and water. Get off your high horse and stand for the flag.
1609 2018-07-27 19:57:53 This job makes me and everything around me smell like lubricating oil. It's pretty gross to be honest.
1610 2018-07-27 19:57:39 Oh! So this is why so many #Albertans are moving to the West Coast!? Make your $$$ from #Alberta #Oil, but don't let it spoil your retirement.
1611 2018-07-27 19:57:02 I haven't done anything for GC and those look great McGravin! Other ideas for places to go: specific booths in the expo hall (IPR, etc), IGDN, or maybe some GQ landmarks like a Train in the Crown Plaza or Lucas Oil Stadium.

1614 2018-07-27 19:56:47 @pdannels tricked me into liking it once by swilling it in olive oil, garlic, and salt, and then tossing it into the oven. Every other time it's been awful. Like eating soap.
1615 2018-07-27 19:56:47 I also think this (transportation) with the electric trolly systems in major cities, unfortunately big oil bought and destroyed them all
1616 2018-07-27 19:56:41 switching argan oil body wash was a good move

1628 2018-07-27 19:54:45 As a weekly newspaper editor in QC 1990-ish the Alberta petroleum promoters sent me a press release and a big chunk of the sand-with-oil-in-it. I can tell you with 100% certainty if it wasn’t chemically “tar” it was a pliable piece of asphalt #tarnotoil

1632 2018-07-27 19:54:25 if you wash your face too often it can cause your skin to be oilier. i wash my face at night and follow up w rosehip oil as my moisturizer. it sounds weird to use an oil on oily skin but it works wonder for me. look it up based on your skin type. witch hazel is good too
1633 2018-07-27 19:54:24 I don’t ever get to wear anything besides work clothes so today i put on a dress and got all dressed up to go get my oil changed and go grocery shopping

1635 2018-07-27 19:54:04 Actually Middle East regime-change is for 'Globalism', 'American Imperialism' is a misnomer because Oil Corporations and Banks mostly located in Europe as well as the USA-(with no national allegiance) are behind Globalist warmongering!

1641 2018-07-27 19:53:41 This is propaganda put out by a UK promoter of wealth oil & gas interests.  They're well aware that most people aren't media literate enough to assess GWPF's credibility.

•Take stock of what your skin is up to by looking at the size of your pores and where you typically get oily or dry. For example, larger pores are a sign of oily skin and needs plenty of astringents and retinoid to balance oil production.

1658 2018-07-27 19:51:23 Between now and 2050 Oil and Natural gas is projected to continually increase with Oil slowing down and Natural has increasing. My quality of life in Northern Colorado is amazing. Instead of studying climate (earths climate follows a cycle), dig deeper into the Oil & Gas Industry
1659 2018-07-27 19:51:21 I have no idea, but traditionally it's butter first, then add oil to keep the butter from burning.

1676 2018-07-27 19:48:35 While wind and solar are small at the moment, virtually nobody produces actual “electricity” from oil any more because hydro, tidal, wind & solar are far more cost effective. Most oil goes to transportation; however, more than 80% of that oil “energy” is wasted as residual heat.
1677 2018-07-27 19:48:31 Note to self: slam dunk more things into the over covered in oil and spices
1678 2018-07-27 19:48:23 @CNBCClosingBell so companies are using tariffs as an excuse to hit customers dispropotionately like Big Oil and gas stations due with any increase in oil futures. #gouging

1680 2018-07-27 19:48:16 I love how the second you mention cost-free public higher education or socialized medicine every single right winger goes “Oh BUt wHat AbOUt vENezUAlA?!?!?!!!” like the one economy that made their social welfare program dependent on gov’t controlled oil is representative of all

1682 2018-07-27 19:47:56 And never forget that Peter Thiel was the original investor and tech adviser to Zuck.  Plus they have people like uber conservative Campbell Brown heading the content area.  These libertarian/big oil and gas fans will sabotage any efforts to bring facts and science to FB.

1688 2018-07-27 19:47:13 I love Italian food. My favorite is a simple dish of capellini with sun-dried tomato and sauteed crushed garlic, drizzled with cold-pressed virgin olive oil, and garnished with sliced fresh basil.

1691 2018-07-27 19:46:54 The renewables don’t produce as much because the infrastructure is not there yet. This chart is historic & might as well be “Capital Expenditure” to date on each type of energy. Your a historian. Thank for that. We want to see future money spent an the alternatives to oil

1702 2018-07-27 19:45:24 We need to be utilizing bioconversion and hydrogen power over fossil fuels. Let our farmers have their crop insurance and grow the fuel for the nation. Big Oil seems to be Big Lobbying...@SenJohnHoeven wouldn’t you agree?

1708 2018-07-27 19:44:45 Data peak, not real peak. Economy never took off since oil allowed to cross $40 in 2011.
1709 2018-07-27 19:44:38 For like a scalp refresh sometimes I use the sea breeze astringent diluted with a little bit of water if I’ve had em in for a while for a nice tingling cleanse. As far as oils I use something light and unscented like grape seed or avacado oil

1711 2018-07-27 19:44:31 got my oil changed last week and they recommended repairs totaling $1200. LOL IMAGINE SINKING $1200 INTO A 2007 PONTIAC G5. I PAID LESS THAN THAT FOR THE VEHICLE ITSELF LOL
1712 2018-07-27 19:44:28 Canada's two biggest export are #water, fresh water and #oil.   We can get the oil to market and we are more that gasoline for our fresh  water.

1714 2018-07-27 19:43:50 oil and gas drilling on public lands is bad, very bad, especially since the reason that most of those public lands NEED to be "restored" is because of oil and gas drilling, although, mining is pretty awful too
1715 2018-07-27 19:43:49 Wow. So many people on this thread are definitely scared of cutting off the war machine and reprioritizing spending. Yikes. 

End oil subsidies, farm subsidies, and corporate welfare for starters. Reverse the latest #TaxScam + make the 1% pay their fair share. Tax churches.
1716 2018-07-27 19:43:49 So good. I drain off the oil and simmer the chovies in the tomato sauce. Just adds a fullness to the flavor. Haaaaa. I had to eat a pasta salad so I could make it till dinner. Your fault.

1729 2018-07-27 19:40:59 Hard to pick just 1! Def remember a trip drive-in w/parents & cousin. We were 6. They thought they’d knock us out w/burgers but it only worked on them, so we saw Mandingo & woke them by screaming during the boiling oil scene. We begged to stay for Cooley High as Dad drive home.

1739 2018-07-27 19:39:38 Only reason I can grasp for US & KSA being "friends" is oil. KSA is brutal. We should be sanctioning them not selling them anything they ask for. Nixon made an agreement with them. Sell oil for US $ & US will sell them arms. Deal w the devil
1740 2018-07-27 19:39:38 Could be the switch.

 I'm guy said he smelled oil and it made a very unusual noise. So... I suspect the motor and the compressor.

1750 2018-07-27 19:38:40 I had a massage recently she wore rubber gloves. It ruined the experiance. If you are allergic to oil or scared of germs on folks skin beauty therapy is nor for you. Crazy or what

You could try washing it down and hope whatever you soap you use helps even out the distribution. Or add a layer of something.

1811 2018-07-27 19:32:26 And it all began 6 years ago when my gp gave me a prescription with arachis (peanut oil) in it. And I looked like Rocky at the end of the movie and had to go A+E and have steroid treatment. Allergies suck
1812 2018-07-27 19:32:04 A good help is coconut oil. Just put a bit on your arms and leave it for a while and it helps a lot
1813 2018-07-27 19:32:03 Exactly. Palm Oil destroys rainforests. I know growing food for Animal Ag is part of it too. I wish i could do more then just be a Vegan who doesn't eat Palm Oil. And yes I know, I hope so too. 
1814 2018-07-27 19:31:54 NOW DOING STATE INSPECTIONS STOP BY GET ONE TODAY OR NEED AN OIL CHANGE WE DO THAT TOO GIVE US A CALL SET UP AN APPOINTMENT 570-800-5335
1815 2018-07-27 19:31:41 Most people receiving welfare are white... and many are rural. Want to talk about socialism? Farm subsidies that pay farmers not to grow. How about special subsidies and tax deals for oil and coal... how about company specific deals like the one for Carrier?
1816 2018-07-27 19:31:35 i like the original for viewing because it is raw...but for prints the oil is deeper :P
1817 2018-07-27 19:30:48 *hasnt changed oil in over a year*

1818 2018-07-27 19:30:39 Wind and solar can replace it, and coal and oil are destroying the climate, so they are only artificially cheap.
1819 2018-07-27 19:30:31 Let's not entirety blame socialism. Yes socialism is a major part of Venezuelas demise, but they had a weak economic policy the relied heavily on the price of oil always rising. Many N European countries have socialism and are doing great compared to the US. Still, good reminder.
1820 2018-07-27 19:30:30 Hoping Kalico don’t get too far in my pocket with this oil change 
1821 2018-07-27 19:30:28 >not simply buying a new car when its time to change the oil
1822 2018-07-27 19:30:26 Horrible job for an owner op, bastard stuff gets everywhere no matter how careful you are or how much shutter oil you spray on dipper, linkage etc. @vincent898 been there, done it & got 
1823 2018-07-27 19:30:17 Sat next to an open window with the breeze drifting in, onions and garlic frying in olive oil on the stove, sipping an extra stout and dreaming of oysters
1824 2018-07-27 19:30:11 I don't trust anything you say flip flop Chuck.  Your nothing more than a snake oil salesmen.
1825 2018-07-27 19:30:07 Fake or not just leave her alone she like everyone else should be hsppy in love and hay im no oil painting but boy god i would be happy to have her in my life for sure
1826 2018-07-27 19:30:02 I use a spin brush every night, if I use it during the day my skin dries out and then I end up producing even more oil

1831 2018-07-27 19:29:32 You have allergies too? My life aswell consist of checking products for peanut oil and mustard seeds and mustard aswell as other ingredients. Daily tablets keep them at bay or I have to go hospital so my throat doesn't swell like a frog  
1832 2018-07-27 19:29:24 yes, you want to snatch her?
1833 2018-07-27 19:29:18 I got no clue about Maca Root...but I assume pills are fine. I take fish oil pills
1834 2018-07-27 19:29:15 Olive oil, coconut oil, honey, and mayonnaise! I just eyeballed the ingredients, but with mostly mayo. I heated the oils/honey on the stove until melted, and then whisked in mayo until smooth :)

1838 2018-07-27 19:28:28 Buying very cheap crude allows them to forget about maximising refinery margin. What is 5 cents gaining on producing one more barrel of heating oil than gasoline when you are getting $15 bucks of discount on the crude
1839 2018-07-27 19:28:14 I am now, I left and went to hyspec but because the way the oil and gas industry went I asked if I could go back and they let me

1841 2018-07-27 19:28:09 mexican and Chinese places are most of the time dependable cause they all have a veggie section. With mexican places tho you'll have to ask w/o cheese or sour cream. Subway is good too imo, I get Italian bread toasted and all the veggies with oil, vinegar, salt & pep.

1855 2018-07-27 19:25:20 that's why you need the US oilseeds to Europe (soybeans that is) and European oil seeds (mostly rapeseed, eg. canola) to China arb to make things work I suspect!

e.g. there is broader substitutability in market for animal feeds.  corn for beans, rapeseed based feeds for soy, etc
1856 2018-07-27 19:25:14 @bbctms  Best sliding medium has to polytetraflouroethylene, it is virtually frictionless, however baby oil is pretty good.
1857 2018-07-27 19:25:08 Difference is, ON was in the tank. AB has stongest economy in Canada, best GDP ratio, roads schools and hospitals being built. Highest retails sales in our history, manufacturing is up, retail is up. Even oil and gas is up
1858 2018-07-27 19:24:52 Bullshit.
1859 2018-07-27 19:24:48 This is comparing apples to oranges. The UAE is abundant with cash because of their oil reserves. They are desperate for teachers & being a predominantly Islamic culture value education a lot more highly than the UK. Whilst I take your point you can't compare the UK to the UAE...
1860 2018-07-27 19:24:46 What resources would that be then?  Who owns the oil fields?  Doesn't it bother you that our fishermen want OUT of the EU?

1869 2018-07-27 19:24:00 Renewable energy is a dead end. Germany (pushing renewables) is 4x as carbon intensive as France (primarily nuclear). Oil companies support wind/solar bc they aren’t consistent enough to run the grid and need a (fossile fuel) backup. Nuclear is the only path to sustainability.

1875 2018-07-27 19:23:07 Lol. You mean like backing rebels in Libya with western air power so they could overthrow a stable, sovereign gov't and destabalize the nation enough for western oil companies to exploit the petroleum resources there without having to pay tribute to local authorities?

1888 2018-07-27 19:21:44 Gas, all types, is back and forth but this has more to do with technology advancement in drilling for oil than a tax break. Like when gas was over $4 a gallon, then new technology made it possible to get more oil from existing wells resulting in higher production & cutting cost

1943 2018-07-27 19:14:00 The growth is one time stuff due to people/companies buying more before the tariffs hit, oil exploration set up, and some extra funding borrowed by government. Not much that will be sustained or repeatable. Hold onto your hats, folks, we're going down. #VoteThemOut

1950 2018-07-27 19:13:03 Trump administration officials worked behind the scenes over the past month to pressure key militia leaders, government officials and oil executives to cooperate or face dire consequences, multiple sources told The Washington Times.

Those sources who are never named!

1956 2018-07-27 19:12:05 well since I am not a painter, like Kick, nor do I play one on TV...it always has to be a print...the oil version does have a bit more dramatic effect...the original photo is a bit closer to my heart b/c it is 'original' but that is me.  Posterized version might be nice also
1957 2018-07-27 19:11:54 Cool!  Me too.  :) So... do you remember what he used when he caremelised the onions?  Brown sugar, but was it butter or oil he used first?
1958 2018-07-27 19:11:53 You don’t seem to understand that we don’t have a free market, we bail out the big guys while we let small businesses fail, massive farms recieve government subsidies, all of Elon Musk’s companies subsidized, oil companies subsidized, weapons manufactures subsidized.
1959 2018-07-27 19:11:52 Well, save as in save the species. It's just so sad. Orangutans may go extinct in 10 years, due to unsustainable #PalmOil . I dont buy any chips ahoy or Oreos or any big name brands that use palm oil for that reason.
1960 2018-07-27 19:11:50 Productive day yesterday! We had a lot of campaign planning and outreach today. I also went to a Kane County meeting to discuss mailers.

1971 2018-07-27 19:10:37 No...what I am saying is that changing your oil every 3000 miles is a good thing but you can go a little long under normal driving conditions. Just do not over do it.

1980 2018-07-27 19:09:56 Oga I think you just lied., just for you to defend a failed administration..., crude oil  price is above 60 $ per barrel presently., is that you are not current or you just decided to lie?

1982 2018-07-27 19:09:37 Whether it makes money or not has exactly nothing to do with my criticisms of the concept of the province operating an oil company.

1984 2018-07-27 19:09:33 What do you mean 70% is privately owned, oil is over 90% of the GDP and it's owned and run by Venezuela's government, so over 90% of the economy is controlled, do you mean that 70% of companies are privately owned? It's still socialist.

1997 2018-07-27 19:07:39 Of course. I only googled that for half a minute. But there was something about him ordering a crackdown or sth, right? Clear support, anyway. It was tempting... "evil people wanting to spill oil on the ground, for fun"
1998 2018-07-27 19:07:35 I know who he is. So what? If what someone in the industry who owns producing oil and gas assets has to say is insignificant to you, and trumped by someone advocating on a downstream product, don't bother following. 'Nuf said indeed.

2008 2018-07-27 19:06:27 Cruden Bay is quite nice but sorry to disappoint, Peterhead has become industrialised with the oil and fishing and unfortunately has a large drug problem. But many other places nearby are beautiful, like Pennan and Crovie.

2108 2018-07-27 18:54:06 First of all, your paragraph was poorly constructed leading credence to the initial postulation. 
Secondly, no one does a head count for surveys. You take a random sample and the results of that sample is a reflection of the larger population size.

2110 2018-07-27 18:53:46 ... the big rebound to investment came after the election, and it can be attributed partly to cyclical factors (like the oil rebound) and partly to a big boost in business confidence tied to Trump.

2146 2018-07-27 18:50:11 Tariffs are on imports. Do you mean export tax? If so, the problem with that is oil is sold delivered and the Canadian exporting company would have to eat the export tax. Charging a tariff on oil sounds good but doesn't actually make any sense
2147 2018-07-27 18:50:06 These folks, like @campbellclaret , are acting like marxist political commisars.

2157 2018-07-27 18:49:26 You know that mining currently contributes to less than 1% of GDP. Even our oil deposits are less than 1b barrels while Uganda has more than 6b barrels and Nigeria is has close to 32b barrels left. Even at peak oil production, mining will only contribute less than 5% to GDP
2158 2018-07-27 18:49:25 If 4.1% GDP is bad news, defeating ISIS is bad news, record low unemployment is bad news, rising wages is bad news, strengthening our military is bad news, being the worlds largest oil producer is bad news, if peace in Korea is bad news, what exactly are the Democrats running on?

2211 2018-07-27 18:42:15 We are seeing strong business investment, much stronger than in 2016, but not noticeably stronger than in 2017. And at least some of it is due to the recovery in oil prices, and rebound in shale drilling.

I was so disgusting WHY do that?
Not cleaning anything up just leaving it in the way AND making it harder to break down naturally
2223 2018-07-27 18:40:29 No problem. Economy booming, unemployment record lows, travel ban in place, oil production mining  pipelines steel new factories, Military rebuilding, trade deals in the works, NATO countries paying their fair share, I'm running out of room.

2250 2018-07-27 18:37:01 There is an oil called Calm Muscles. You can diffuse it or you can use a few drops as a massage oil.

2258 2018-07-27 18:35:54 Yeah, a thin guise of "ecosystem protection” subservient to an underlying assertion of the “inevitability” of further growth of oil extraction/consumption, used to paternalistically justify colonially forcing a pipeline through multiple First Nations’ land without consent.

2276 2018-07-27 18:33:29 No it's unfixable. We can only mitigate. Same with an ocean and atmosphere that has absorbed too more CO2. Same with reaching peak oil/gas/coal. We're in quite a pickle already, we just don't see it. And even if we hit the brakes now, we're still in for some tough times.

2281 2018-07-27 18:32:34 I think it does bc I’ve used CBC oil like consumed it and it just really chills you out and relaxes you and your body you just don’t feel high you know?

2301 2018-07-27 18:30:01 Lots of manipulation, not trading based on oil at all though.  If you notice it went from 1.50 to 3+ the last time oil plummeted.  Just technical battle grounds at this point
2302 2018-07-27 18:30:00 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

2319 2018-07-27 18:27:36 Hey people. If you have a car, other than checking the engine oil, water, and whatsnots, please also check the third brake light at the back. It is very important too. So other drivers will know that you’re stopping the car especially during emergency time.
2320 2018-07-27 18:27:24 I don't think the two are mutually exclusive. We should condemn and oppose all attempts to perpetuate the world's dependence on fossil fuels. Why can we not oppose both Putin's and Trudeau's subservience to the interests of Big Oil?

There's the presumption/preconceived notion that I'm swimming in oil money, and I don't have to work for anything. So there's an antipathy towards me.

2329 2018-07-27 18:26:15 If there is a clearly defined policy goal for government starting an oil company than it ought to be pursued.  For example,  in 1992,  the potential goal of equity was continuing with Hibernia. As it is, others took up the slack Gulf left.

2348 2018-07-27 18:24:11 Let’s play the game of picking the 20thC year, 25 years after which, technology would NOT have been seen to have “radically changed our world”

Cars. Penicillin. Radio. TV. Global Oil. A-bombs. Double helix. Aircraft. Air Travel. ICBMs/Sputnik. ENIAC. Wiping out killer diseases…
2349 2018-07-27 18:24:04 By imposing a trade tariff, the USA is actaully making  Britain by LESS  US goods .you Mr Trump. Britain finished repaying it WW2 debt to the USA in 2005.but we still owe the USA  billions  for oil, electrical goods and yes cars.
2350 2018-07-27 18:24:04 A3: I love using it in a SUPER quick (promise: no more than 3 mins!) salad dressing recipe that's full of health benefits & no added sugar. Just whisk together 1 cup of 100% fruit juice with 2 Tbsp. each red wine or white vinegar & extra-virgin olive oil. Voila! #RealJuiceMatters
2351 2018-07-27 18:23:56 If that is 'not halal' what cooking oil is the Ustazah using haha
2352 2018-07-27 18:23:40 Our friends @repurpose in @LACIncubator are all over that. They make products from plants, not oil. And they are wildly popular.
2353 2018-07-27 18:23:40 I get the "I'm never coming back here for service again!"....6 months and a horror story oil change at Jiffy Lube later, "hey, nice to see you again."
2354 2018-07-27 18:23:39 Came for an oil change and found 3 more things wrong with my car
2355 2018-07-27 18:23:35 I use olive oil regulary
2356 2018-07-27 18:23:25 And BC.
And most cities. And most universities (Education makes you less regressive)

Sorry, but don't lump the coast in with you idiots in the middle. We're not against western oil, we're against sending crude to tidewater.

REFINE IT WHERE YOU MINE IT. Sell it to Canada!!!
2357 2018-07-27 18:23:17 see? It's better to think of it as the state-owned tool to carry on its oil policy. Not a company.
2358 2018-07-27 18:23:07 Oil pan gasket
2359 2018-07-27 18:23:07 Oil water
2360 2018-07-27 18:22:52 Trump @realDonaldTrump Compromise by the Russians. A traitor to his own country. All in the name of greed. What does Russia have that we want? Oil. The only thing they do have. They need the United States behind them. The two dictators want to take over the world.
2361 2018-07-27 18:22:39 The performance attribution of CNY on EMFX took over the EUR and oil prices about 3 weeks ago, but it has faded over the last week.
2362 2018-07-27 18:22:33 Barriers?

Like "Must pay for oil spills"
LOL yeah, sorry if you wanna foot the bill when shit goes wrong, why don't you put all your kids piggy banks together and go for it, but lay the pipe in YOUR backyard.
2363 2018-07-27 18:22:32 Is the US in debt to China?
As of Sept 2014, foreigners owned $6 trillion of U.S. debt, or approx 47% of the debt held by the public of $13 trillion and 34% of total debt of $1 trillion. The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean bnkg centers and oil exporters.
2364 2018-07-27 18:22:28 The price of oil is rising.

With the increase in price those who could afford to purchase yesterday may not have the same buying power as today. 

Cheap oil damages expensive items and expensive oil damages cheap things.

#selah #thekingdomofGoddeterminestheprice
2365 2018-07-27 18:22:22 Using sesame oil this time was a great executive decision by me
2366 2018-07-27 18:22:22 I was up till 3:30 in the morning the other night with horrible anxiety about leaving my 3 year old anywhere without me. He goes to day care..this isn't new. But, I was freaking out about it! I smothered myself in lavender oil and remembered I have to put trust into others. 
2367 2018-07-27 18:22:21 I actually used to use baby oil and it kind of worked but clogged up the drain and tub. Th coconut oil rinses away easy with hot water and my skin is so soft after, not greasy.
2368 2018-07-27 18:22:14 Walking down #woodgrangeroad was like walking down a third world street! Shit everywhere, shops boarded up rubbish all over the place and the junction of #sebertroad awash with oil and fat from the countless fast food shops! A proper #shithole #newham
2369 2018-07-27 18:22:00 Finally my dad took my car to get some new tires  I hope he got an oil change and checked my air filters
2370 2018-07-27 18:22:00 In the #Houston Chronicle - @HoustonChron our economist Karr Ingham, giving the #texaspetroindex :

“This is a transformational shift, We’re breaking production records with tens of thousands fewer employees.”

2372 2018-07-27 18:21:48 2 things are happening today ... I’m getting my oil changed & afterwards I’m going home to watch #OITNB 
2373 2018-07-27 18:21:41 @Volkswagen 2014 Jetta with 80k (7th oil change). My oil drain pan threads are gone - is this a design flaw or the fault of the dealership where I’ve had all my oil changes?
2374 2018-07-27 18:21:31 THC Oil?
2375 2018-07-27 18:21:27 oooooohhhh i have seen liquid coconut oil and yesim drunk tired and sad oooooffff
2376 2018-07-27 18:21:27 Dawg, why niggas driving like it’s raining canola oil?
2377 2018-07-27 18:21:26 How do I make the clear distinction that when I look at news articles about sham science & essential oil shilling & sketchy diets, it's because I like to be informed of the many horrible ways people are led astray, and I'm not actually asking to see ads promoting these things.
2378 2018-07-27 18:21:23 Continued,
Peoplekind remark. Vets, sorry you are asking for too much. Billions to the UN and Sharia compliant states! Allows OPEC oil killing our energy sector! Bought pipeline for more than it was worth. Off shore protected bank accounts. Kahdr payout and lie!
Your turn!
2379 2018-07-27 18:21:17 You get everything for nothing cos you are looters. Oil wells in the South,northerners own 75%. Is it by merit or stealing. Shut up.
2380 2018-07-27 18:21:02 แชงค่ะ
2381 2018-07-27 18:21:01 Government already owns the oil.  Period.  It doesn't need to become an oil company/developer (which is what equity really is about) in order to earn money or own oil.
2382 2018-07-27 18:20:47 Truly glorious tomatoes need nothing more than good sourdough, olive oil, garlic, and salt IMO.
2383 2018-07-27 18:20:47 first oil change today
2384 2018-07-27 18:20:28 I fell asleep while my car was getting an oil change whoops
2385 2018-07-27 18:20:26 Agree with that Adam - am using the Oil Otex on interior and exterior work as it goes on easily and dries much quicker than other undercoats..
2386 2018-07-27 18:20:19 The country would have progressed beyond the levels of sliding ito recession at the fall in the price of crude. 
Put differently, the savings we got was occasioned by high price of crude under him upto GEJ' reign, conversely, the downturn in reserves caused by low oil prices.
2387 2018-07-27 18:20:09 TOO DRUNK HSDFHJD YOU OKAY THERE? coconut oil is solid but it also exists in in a liquid form. i have solid coconut oil and it has never melted before unless i use it but since it's literal HELL temperature rn it did 
2388 2018-07-27 18:20:03 My personal combo is coconut oil and then I use a bit of Vaseline on top because it’s a sealant and it the locks moisture from the coconut oil in.
2389 2018-07-27 18:20:03 Every time I go to @jiffylube in Vallejo I feel like I always get used or hustle... it’s an inconvenience if the “computer systems” are “down” and had to go out of my way to pay them for a oil change out of my pocket..
2390 2018-07-27 18:19:52 The Venezuelan Mandolin Orchestra is staging a sit in at Basingstoke. Mr Keith Dickspray III, Guard (18th class) is currently stuck in a knocking shop in Acton so no more trains for you fellows tonight. We accidentally used lemur snot instead of lubricating oil. Trains stolen.

2394 2018-07-27 18:19:21 I always feel like hair companies come out with new stolen ingredients from some country every other week like what is marula oil
2395 2018-07-27 18:19:20 Can't express how good it feels to speak with a female mechanic @jiffylube because a) she doesn't talk to me like I'm an idiot newborn baby & b) when I say "no I don't know what oil I want", her response is to explain several options & why & to LISTEN to what I say back
2396 2018-07-27 18:19:19 My bf was supposed to help me with my braids today but he ended up having to go to work... what kinda man would go get money to support us instead of doing free labor with hands covered in coconut oil.. tf

2406 2018-07-27 18:18:22 I’m getting a oil change, tire rotation, and car wash all for free 
2407 2018-07-27 18:18:21 Alaskans own 646,504 shares of SINO GAS & ENERGY HOLDINGS LTD, worth $47,839. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CHINA.
2408 2018-07-27 18:18:03 My cousin was trying to cook using this oil when her son came and told he that the oil is not halal according to his ustazah. The kid is in primary school, I cant even
2409 2018-07-27 18:17:56 US pumps more oil per year than Russia.    KSA, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE and other Gulf states, all dependent on oil.

Canada subsidies our oil industry the most.

Now back to 'Russia'.   #rollseyes
2410 2018-07-27 18:17:40 Okay, I've been thinking about this whole mayonnaise ice cream thing. So, it's just another emulsion. What if, instead of Hellman's, you made your own mayo with ghee instead of oil? A little lemon juice as the acid? Then use that nutty-tasting goodness in your base? I'd try it.
2411 2018-07-27 18:17:38 Scottish water wil soon be more valuable than  Scottish oil. Get digging those reservoirs.
2412 2018-07-27 18:17:36 coconut oil is my new favourite 
2413 2018-07-27 18:17:35 All these oil rigs out here how about put some fucking cellphone towers jesus christ.
2414 2018-07-27 18:17:35 . fortunate to meet a virile trajectory deeply entrenched with every standards tht guarantees a departure from our gaps and shocks of the vulnerabilities of continuous reliance on the oil sector for survival.

2416 2018-07-27 18:17:18 @Luminaria98 why don't you ask @GerberKawasaki about his positions in "Big Oil"?
2417 2018-07-27 18:17:15 I need one of those weed pens things with alot of THc oil
2418 2018-07-27 18:17:08 Is he referring to the oil company subsidies and farmers 12 billion dollar bailout?
2419 2018-07-27 18:17:08 Those who would give up essential Other lager, to purchase a little temporary Hatch, deserve neither Tinplate nor Sesame oil.
2420 2018-07-27 18:16:59 Used that on our infant instead of baby oil because Johnson & Johnson made her break out
2421 2018-07-27 18:16:41 Oil all the way!
2422 2018-07-27 18:16:39 Ms. McKenna you can't expect to be taken seriously! Building that pipeline is the wrong way to go about fighting climate change. It's what has gotten us in this mess. Stop propagandizing, stop selling snake oil.

2428 2018-07-27 18:15:47 I think it's constructive for oil services stocks that $OIH is in a bullish momentum regime (14-day RSI > 30 on this May-June decline)

2431 2018-07-27 18:15:32 Can’t  ride in this heat, too hot and ground too hard. Just hose down horse, apply fly spray, put coconut oil on their feet and back to feeding hay meant for winter.
2432 2018-07-27 18:15:27 Lmao at least they were nice enough to give me some tree tea oil in my dream cause that’s the most they’ve done for me
2433 2018-07-27 18:15:23 Someone is going to step back from that oven with a pot of hot oil.
2434 2018-07-27 18:15:18 maybe if you just put some cinnamon oil on the weed??
2435 2018-07-27 18:15:17 True revolutionaries do not flaunt their radicalism, Alinsky taught. They cut their hair, put on suits and infiltrate the system from within. Alinsky viewed revolution as a slow, patient process. The trick was to penetrate existing institutions.
2436 2018-07-27 18:15:16 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2437 2018-07-27 18:15:00 I make sure to dump all my grease, chemicals, and residual oil out of all my cans first, then pour it over all my plastic, which I’ve cut  up into nice turtle and sea gull sized bites, then throw it all in 
2438 2018-07-27 18:14:55 start swimming!! lavender oil is good, cut out (or cut down) caffeine, read a book for 30 min before bed, look into therapy options, vitamin D and vitamin B, get some blood work done and see what your doc says
2439 2018-07-27 18:14:37 We have a highly diversified economy for one, not pegged to an oil commodity. Debts are denominated in dollars for two. Default is only possible if the elected branches choose it. US govt is the only source of dollars.

2441 2018-07-27 18:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
2442 2018-07-27 18:14:12 The us is a whole different place, got 100 different types of olive oil in a supermarket
2443 2018-07-27 18:14:03 YES!! But if you increase glycerin oil to rose water ratio it becomes more of a moisturizer
2444 2018-07-27 18:13:16 Yes, love the feeling of warm bath in the night before bed (has many research that positive effects on our body) and clean feeling. Canada is much drier/colder so probably need less shower and bath since too much shower and hot bath can strip away the good oil from the skin.
2445 2018-07-27 18:13:08 Ranch dressing? Or the semen of NRA members? Glad I didn't have to taste it. Probably also contained gun oil and the blood of African-Americans.
2446 2018-07-27 18:13:06 Anyway heb deze training mijn bokszak kapot gemaakt, i deserve to be smothered in shea butter en tea tree oil nu
2447 2018-07-27 18:13:01 how else do you oil them smh
2448 2018-07-27 18:12:38 Am from South Sudan and that is s very shallow thinking. 
Our oil fields are no where near the border and also the gradient is sloping towards Egypt if you consider the Nile flow. 

Imenti triangle is an issue however
2449 2018-07-27 18:12:07 "honey, you HAVE to come try this olive oil." -some white person, probably
2450 2018-07-27 18:12:06 A1. I make a great salad dressing recipe that uses 100% orange juice, canola oil, green onions, salt and pepper. Yum! #RealJuiceMatters @Fruits_Veggies
2451 2018-07-27 18:12:05 With oils they’re all the same, since oils are the “in thing” some brands are more pricey than others but no brand is better than another.  just make sure it’s that one pure oil and not several mixed to make one
2452 2018-07-27 18:11:47 It leads fish away from garbage and oil leaks. The circles attract the fish!

2459 2018-07-27 18:09:56 Try searching for “rfid blocking wallet”. Growth industry, wallets that protect you from this stuff. Informed opinion is such wallets are sophisticated snake oil, but hey.
2460 2018-07-27 18:09:52 Oil seems to also be leaking real bad

2462 2018-07-27 18:09:26 Before Donald Trump ran for president, he was in an interview on a morning show, probably with George Stephanopoulos I recall. He asked him about negotiating with the Middle East about oil prices. He said, "We should just take it." If anyone has that interview, spread it around.
2463 2018-07-27 18:09:05 Yeah and vegetable oil
2464 2018-07-27 18:08:47 Can't wait to get this haircut tomorrow. Beard about to be flourishing too. gonna put some oil in it too for extra effects.

2466 2018-07-27 18:08:32 Because we care #OOTT :  If you are a junior oil trader for an Oilpatch corp & in a trading slump, & your employer doesn't train you how to trade (like BP trains their people) you should ask around & pay to spend a week with an experienced trader to learn energy trading skills.

2477 2018-07-27 18:07:16 "Oil prices should be around $ 45 a barrel at most, based on fundamentals. The rest has been made up of manufactured crises and manipulation of perceptions in a world where oil is rapidly becoming a surplus commodity."  So true!
2478 2018-07-27 18:07:10 The monstrous appetite for the obscene looting then would have been sustained by borrowing & syndicated loans of all sorts.

Don't forget the $2bn loan at the twilight of the govt to pay salaries while oil sold at $60pb!
2479 2018-07-27 18:07:02 @NTB oh my god. 1.5 hour wait time and counting for a rotation and oil change.  Tell me why I stopped doing this myself at home?  Best part is that I was early for my appointment.

Loaded with antioxidants & heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, EVOO has been shown to decrease risk of heart attacks & strokes, along with fighting inflammation. #FridayMotivation
2486 2018-07-27 18:06:10 Is there oil in Katsina? When will all this tribalistic bull crap stop in this country. You will now want one huge figure approved for building a long pipeline and to provide security around same. The thunder that will fire u won't have a political party

2491 2018-07-27 18:05:07 Squandering oil revenues with cash payments where a mature democracy demanded investment first in infrastructure to create downstream oil industries and secondly a sovereign wealth fund for when the oil runs dry, see Norges Bank / Norway
2492 2018-07-27 18:05:00 I’ve started using straight up coconut oil on my skin applied with a cotton pad, let sit, and then washed off with a gentle soap and it has made a HUGE improvement. Even helps with inflammation and pain on my skin and scalp.
2493 2018-07-27 18:04:57 PS it was the arab oil embargo! We had a flat tire on the thruway right B4 the traffic jam.  A farmer from a nearby field helped us, then took out the fence beside us, & led us  across his field onto a road that took us right into town! #gratefuldead #serendipity

Subaru says that this is unrelated to the oil loss lawsuit already filed for this engine or the previous time they had to mill the block because it was warped and replaced the head gaskets.
2504 2018-07-27 18:03:33 An 'easy-cut' tear-off corner on the seasoning oil sachet? Ottogi, you rule! Wish I'd waited until I was proper drunk to make my instant ramen, to get the full benefit of the assistance.
2505 2018-07-27 18:03:30 Burger lunch while I get my oil changed because I’m worth it 
2506 2018-07-27 18:03:25 Dumped 2 Trillion on a sugar high taken as a debt on the backs of everyone in the bottom 90% and their kids with no infrastructure from it... and then had huge fear hype driving pre-tariff buys.  Carney is a snake oil fraud. Just like Trump and Ryan
2507 2018-07-27 18:03:08 Engine oil becomes dirty, junk builds up, oil stop flowing, engine seize up, spend 2+ racks on a new motor
2508 2018-07-27 18:03:07 Why would you let these types of people into your country is beyond me their way of living and their thought process is not compatible with many countries it's like oil and water

2511 2018-07-27 18:02:54 Dear Sir. I notice we have the same EW count on #oil prices which is pretty worrying because we could fall very low (possibly the mid $40s)... Do you have a #WTI alternate/bullish count?

2522 2018-07-27 18:01:08 I always fry in peanut oil. I also add hot sauce to the egg dredge. Makes a nice tingle with the crunch :)
2523 2018-07-27 18:01:02 Kenya and South Sudan share the same oil belt and our fields are much lower than south sudan. Once we start draining south sudan oil fields and they notice, things are going to get nasty in Turkana. Mark this tweet.
2524 2018-07-27 18:01:00 Wow
This is so sad

Pls put a link or story here

2527 2018-07-27 18:00:28 #NutritionTip:
The more solid a fat at room temperature, the more saturated the fat. Limit and/or avoid foods that are made with trans fatty acids (hydrogenated fats). Best oils to use are #monounsaturated #oils: olive or canola oil, trans fatty acid free margarine
2528 2018-07-27 18:00:17 @RudyGiuliani lost his marbles some time ago. Too bad that he will not be remembered as Americas Mayor after this. Way to go Rudy !! ... fuck up your legacy for a crook, liar, snake oil salesmen, Russian Agent. Remember this @realDonaldTrump will through you under bus also
2529 2018-07-27 18:00:16 Yum! When they are slightly more ripened, I love to slice them up and arrange them on a plate, season with salt, a generous dusting of sumac and a drizzle of olive oil, and you have a delicious snack 
2530 2018-07-27 18:00:10 I have had literally the most productive day I’ve had in like three weeks. I laid down some paver stones, swept the porch, swept my house, did dishes, cleaned up, went to lunch w my bf, filled my tires, got an oil change, cleaned out my car and now I’m about 2 fix a broken nail
2531 2018-07-27 18:00:06 The saddest part is this country was robbed of its true POTUS! It hurts my heart&soul to think of the damage done by Trump and Republicans: Babies taken from Mothers, poison that Hitler used in air and H20, today endangering species act to be killed for oil&gas thugs on US land
2532 2018-07-27 17:59:54 We've only got cooking oil at home lol
2533 2018-07-27 17:59:50 I HATE when I take my car in for an oil change and it ends up being a huge fiasco and they have to keep my car 
2534 2018-07-27 17:59:49 Why do they do it? Are they all trying to get in on Russian PAC money or is it getting at the oil fields or what?
2535 2018-07-27 17:59:49 I had an appointment for my oil at 11 and I just woke up fml
2536 2018-07-27 17:59:46 45 minutes to stop using oil
2537 2018-07-27 17:59:39 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
2538 2018-07-27 17:59:18 Beating the below belt yeah? So all you can say and notice in that status is someone’s mouth...... You don’t have profile picture there and I bet your look ain’t the most oil painting..... Embarrassing!!!!
2539 2018-07-27 17:59:05 If you like a lot of flavor, try chicken quarters, rubbed with salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, oregano, cilantro, a tiny bit of cayenne, vegetable oil and lemon juice. Let it soak in for a few hours and then grill.
2540 2018-07-27 17:58:48 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

2543 2018-07-27 17:58:38 They last a few weeks and petroleum based straw particles in your stomach is probably much worse than plant based material but whatever defends oil tycoons.
2544 2018-07-27 17:58:27 Good idea! Maybe businesses will look into biodegradable hemp plastics as an alternative, before laws like that spread out and put every oil plastic makers and distributors in jail!

Otherwise you're stampeding citizens to be bootlickers when we should check them and gold them accountable.

2558 2018-07-27 17:56:47 And btw...we should always care about what we look like no matter our age.  Not some Cosmopolitan ideal or Oil of Olay ad model...but what makes US happy when we look in the mirror.
2559 2018-07-27 17:56:35 How about not talking and actually seeing how people effected by the Supreme Leader and his snake oil salesmen feel about your blind allegiance?
2560 2018-07-27 17:56:07 Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, has double the gdp per capita than the U.K., is 30% bigger than the U.K. and has a fraction of the debt. The reason it has all that is because it doesn’t spend its oil revenues, nothing to with not being in the EU
2561 2018-07-27 17:55:58 If Rod Adams' recent article is correct, nuclear plants are falling victim to #price #dumping by govt. subsidized solar/wind and Big Oil backed natural gas generators.
2562 2018-07-27 17:55:37 Enough already. The planet is baking and burning. We should seize the assets of the BIg Oil, and place them in escrow to pay the costs of mitigating all the environmental destruction for which they are responsible.

2567 2018-07-27 17:54:36 Unless oil prices drop again in between the short term and the long term.
2568 2018-07-27 17:54:25 @Jim_Jordan a rational choice.  Why he prob won't be speaker. 
Republicans should be busy rolling back every gain made by left for last 50 + yrs. 
Most prefer status quo, dem agenda just temporarily at idle. Back in power, will just start where they left off

2570 2018-07-27 17:53:48 He definitely hasn't done that. I work in O&G and PA basically ran us out with their cash grab taxes. I have to go to Texas to work these days because all those rigs left PA when oil prices bottomed out but PA Taxes kept rising. I hate Texas. (FYI I'm a Dem and voted for Wolf)

In Venezuela it is about spreading oil wealth equally, not just the robber-baron tycoons who tend to dominate in hyper-capitalist South American Societies. Also Cuba is getting internet on phones. Cuba has 100% health care.
2589 2018-07-27 17:50:48 Agree. I was raised in the 70s too. Vegetable oils and margarine.  #seedoils like soybean and canola oil. There is a huge Omega 6/Omega 3 imbalance and they are in everything these days. Also, more people at red meat, eggs, butter and a lot less sugar.

2595 2018-07-27 17:50:02 Venezuela found it infeasible despite running its own fiat currency, and sitting on the world's largest proven reserves of oil to boot.
2596 2018-07-27 17:49:44 We apologize. In Europe we get Total, a company with very good financial results and oil production progress. May be a more efficient management it's the key point.

2608 2018-07-27 17:48:31 2. The Carbon Tax is going to have to be INSANE to even slightly make your economy consider transferring to renewable energy. Let's be straight about this. If you tax carbon companies, the price of all the fuel is going to go up. That is not going to harm big oil and gas...

2616 2018-07-27 17:48:09 Don’t go digging up abandoned oil fields thinking you can get oil. Soon, you will find out why the other oil exploring companies abandoned the wells!

2617 2018-07-27 17:48:03 LOVE your Organic Body Oil & Organic Balm - just wonderful. On a seperate note- Are you around for a quick chat next week? I just opened my business, working with brands to help them find more customers Vicky 
Ps. I know a social media specialist if you're still looking
2618 2018-07-27 17:47:55 Yeah that’s fair :( Tea tree oil is always good tho, and I think the big thing about Herbalism that halped me was that it had a bunch of rice vinegar in it. Stanky, but keeps you clean! Witch hazel is great too!
2619 2018-07-27 17:47:50 4% growth spurred by Corp. Tax cuts.   Deregulation growing sectors of economy that BHO declared dead (manufacturing) or tried to kill (oil).  US now worlds largest producer of oil & gas. Lowest unemployment in decades.  Lowest African  & Hispanic unemploment in history.

2621 2018-07-27 17:47:41 Just listened to the @spittinchiclets  podcast with @27MilanLucic, based on what Lucic said he is gearing up for a bounce back season. I am hoping that happens and the #Oilers as a team have a bounce back year. Also, my new favorite podcast, highly recommend it to any hockey fans
2622 2018-07-27 17:47:39 I actually feel sorry for the leavers in that the government has utterly failed to approach the thing professionally or with respect for the involved parties. They’ve been had by charlatans promising snake oil results. There never was a plan
2623 2018-07-27 17:47:31 Yup. Fatty Suya dripping oil + soft bread = Bliss.

2625 2018-07-27 17:47:09 For one thing, Putin was probably not happy that Trump was trying to persuade Merkel to scuttle the pipeline deal she had with Russia, in favor of American oil. That had just happened, so yeah, Putin was trolling. He knew that one statement would give Trump endless grief.
2626 2018-07-27 17:46:49 I'm confident in believing that GOD does NOT eat spam or bacon, wave a flag, sing an anthem, watch porn, get drunk, sell prescription pills, spray poisons on otherwise clean food items, would not promote over population or abortion, or kill over ownership of oil selling programs.

2629 2018-07-27 17:46:27 Global warming is real. But do you have to blee oil companies that deny it? Rude
2630 2018-07-27 17:46:21 Girl, yes!  We have seen burnt valves before but this was something no one in the shop had seen before.  No metal shards in oil pan and no excessive oil consumption.  Waiting to see what TAC says.

2632 2018-07-27 17:45:25 Bit complicated to explain on a twitter feed, but ok let's give it a go. Brewing changes the oil and acid compounds of hops, they are very much effected by heat, oxygen and UV light that's why after brewing they will eventually fade whatever you do to prolong
2633 2018-07-27 17:45:19 - The Ex generals are murmuring, Why? There is no sign President Buhari will renew their oil blocks contract.

2646 2018-07-27 17:42:55 That is a absolute and detestable lie! The truth is the planet can't handle even a billion people if our weather wasn't destsbalizing,  our oil depleting,  our biosphere dying, our fresh water running dry, our seas becoming dangerious, diseases becoming resistant. Your so wrong.

2659 2018-07-27 17:40:42 I have fried fries and some sorts of meat for over 15 years and I have no clue what "foaming" is. I just use Oil (You can use basically any type I guess) and drop whatever you wanna fry. I don't need any other chemical to prevent anything, just keep the temperature at 170 Celsius

2661 2018-07-27 17:40:33 Water and Oil don't mix. Period.
2662 2018-07-27 17:40:26 it’s weird since mayo is simply egg yolks and oil. Since ice cream is basically egg yolks and cream/milk, wouldn’t that make it oil-flavored ice cream?

2672 2018-07-27 17:39:37 @RepMcClintock hey, renewables are not politically motivated means of electricity. They are essential to PR's future infrastructure, stop trying to give your oil company buddies blowjobs. And cheap isnt better, you get what you pay for dumbass.
2673 2018-07-27 17:39:36 Tell your Representatives: Stand up against oil and gas development in the #ArcticRefuge. http://1/#.W1tY1v_mpyg.twitter
2674 2018-07-27 17:39:28 I will do! I can see chilli oil leaking out of it, so that’s promising!
2675 2018-07-27 17:39:13 Vega Sport® Protein Bars contain palm kernel oil. Promoting sustainability is important to us at Vega®, that is why we source Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sustainable palm kernel oil. We hope this helps! 
2676 2018-07-27 17:39:10 It's also important to note that you have to intake good fats. So MCT oil, Avocado and olive are great. Fish is great as well. Chicken and pork are not too bad, and I eat beef rarely. Your HDL and LDL will spike for 6 months or so and eventually level out.
2677 2018-07-27 17:38:58 I be ready to tell them that’s not my car, the owner told me take it for an oil change. 
2678 2018-07-27 17:38:48 That is 100% bs. You have absolutely no data to support that statement. Many factors cause inflation, oil and transportation costs being significant as well as regulations. That shit you just spewed is a lie.
2679 2018-07-27 17:38:48 So the price of oil doesn’t have anything to do with employment numbers in the oil industry? Hmmm. Not sure you’re right about that...
2680 2018-07-27 17:38:47 I got an oil change and my maintenance light still didn’t go off. Oh well

2682 2018-07-27 17:38:43 My fave is grilled crookneck with a seasoned salt and pepper, light coat of olive oil. Grilling really brings out the sweetness.
2683 2018-07-27 17:38:41 We need more schools and roads!! Thank god for oil and gas
2684 2018-07-27 17:38:40 @DrGundry If the breads in the US are made with transglutaminase which is not good for us, why can't we make our own bread at home with the same yeast that is used in Europe & then enjoy bread as a delivery method for olive oil into our mouths?
2685 2018-07-27 17:38:20 LPG seems to be a by-product of natural gas or oil refining processes so as a whole it's not environmentally particularly good. At the use area it's environmentally better than coal or oil.
EU can't afford to pay American LPG prices.
Besides, sanctions don't belong to free trade.
2686 2018-07-27 17:38:19 When was the last time you had your oil and engine coolant changed? Are you overdue for your routine change?

2688 2018-07-27 17:38:01 Vegan Cooking Tip: If you are cooking oil-free say on a skillet, instead of using oil substitute it with water. You may need to add water than you would if you used oil, but you truly get the same result if you were to use the other.

2697 2018-07-27 17:36:58 I'm just Haitian and does boiled fish oil = Pouasson nan sauce?....because if so, we definitely do it
2698 2018-07-27 17:36:48 It goes further, if you factor in $NFLX, $FB, $INTC, $TSLA etc the market has lost its only leadership.  Commodities started tanking 2 months ago, small caps topped about a month ago, tech and Oil were last.  This can go into a bear market possibly in the next few months easily
2699 2018-07-27 17:36:46 Have you tried lavender essential oil..in a diffuser or mix it with your lotions ..it is a calming oil
2700 2018-07-27 17:36:43 They said mans was planning on jumping on top and he slipped on oil on the street ctfu
2701 2018-07-27 17:36:31 Maybe the statoil wanted government buy-in to go ahead with the development. If so, it was worth it. But buying oil project equity for its own sake is not what our government should be doing.
2702 2018-07-27 17:36:24 #Traffic update: Avoid Waters Ave from 63rd to Eisenhower. Sand trucks are en route to aid fire units in cleaning a large oil trail. This will cause delays.
2703 2018-07-27 17:36:16 At the car dealership waiting on my oil change and these two little boys are running around acting wild- they asked one lady what was in her cup and she smiled and said “water!” I can’t help but think I would have said “poison for nosy little boys.” 
2704 2018-07-27 17:36:09 I’m sitting at the place I get my oil changed and they have Fox News on. Do you think I, a.) remained where I was, or b.)went to sit outside?  (Its 170 degrees in Souh Alabama-with the humidity. )
2705 2018-07-27 17:36:03 No, not enough Gladiators. 300 '', on the *other* dr, has even the most hetero easing us out shopping for baby oil.
2706 2018-07-27 17:36:03 Too many things need to be done by midday tomorrow but tido dulu. I ain't got the energy to burn the midnight oil like when I'm in my 20s.
2707 2018-07-27 17:36:02 I think you’ve misunderstood us (or at least me). I still use things derived from oil, I’m just attempting to use less, both to help everyone and to save myself money. I don’t see where the hypocrisy is in that? Why advocate to make things worse?
2708 2018-07-27 17:35:51 Its alright, not your fault as that silver tongued empty headed suit fooled a lot of people...classic snake oil swindler.
Life outside the libtard vortex is more simple and pleasant.
2709 2018-07-27 17:35:48 Unfortunately the chance is often gone. Think of a car with service lights on. The lights have been ignored for months, the oil hasn't been changed regularly, and the car has been driven in poor quality gasoline. The time to repair isn't when you're broken down on the interstate.
2710 2018-07-27 17:35:47 I thought that was olive oil wow

2715 2018-07-27 17:35:15 Your car and die from not changing the oil. Should the insurance company change the oil for me? No, because poor maintenance isn’t an emergency or accident.

Just like unhealthy lifestyles aren’t. Yet this small group of people are responsible for lion’s share of healthcare costs

2719 2018-07-27 17:34:28 Oil prices should be around $ 45 a barrel at most, based on fundamentals. The rest has been made up of manufactured crises and manipulation of perceptions in a world where oil is rapidly becoming a surplus commodity.
2720 2018-07-27 17:34:23 Snake oil! Get your snake oil here!
2721 2018-07-27 17:34:20 Sometimes I have to go for a walk. Fresh air really helps. I also talk myself through things out loud. Also, CBD oil is a miracle worker. I live in WA so it’s legal, but w/it I can still worry but not get the bodily overwhelming anxious feelings. And it helps me sleep!
2722 2018-07-27 17:34:20 I got that Viking horsehair beard situation, I need seven conditioners  and oil and the blood of an Irish monk to leave the house respectable
2723 2018-07-27 17:33:55 lol, hardly. I just refuse to go into Lucas Oil and have anyone think I'm a Colts fan.
2724 2018-07-27 17:33:37 Using essential oil to my face and stings
2725 2018-07-27 17:33:28 you all arguing over whether China's 50% state-owned economy is socialism whilst I uphold socialist Saudi Arabia's 60% state economy that has lifted millions out of poverty with oil
2726 2018-07-27 17:33:22 Oil prices are on the way back up since a low in 2014, brought about by over supply. Those steel mill jobs( I had one too once) and the auto plant , won’t ever , play that same role as an employer. Automation is the largest factor. So I’m not following you here..
2727 2018-07-27 17:33:21 So close:
Preheat the oven to 425*.
Wash & dry the potatoes.
Pierce the potato 2-3 times with a fork.
Rub oil all over the potatoes.
Rub salt all over the potatoes.
Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for about 45 minutes. ...
Serve w all of your favorite toppings!
2728 2018-07-27 17:33:13 Nice phrasing.
A pity so many men will construe it as: "Fry your chicken wings in soybean oil & dip them into dressing made from soybean oil while watching football if you want to be healthy."
2729 2018-07-27 17:33:12 Just some beard oil, I forget the brand
2730 2018-07-27 17:33:04 No!!!! NDP killed the oil patch and encouraged buying an empty pipeline with tax dollars.  You’ve done enough harm.  Stay out of this.
2731 2018-07-27 17:33:03 I think the generic royalty regime is good: an improvement over previous projects. I think the equity investment is a mistake: not because it is sure to fail, but because we are over exposed to oil price risk.
2732 2018-07-27 17:33:02 This guy at Jiffy Lube just told me like twelve different things to do with my car, but I was honestly too busy staring into his OCEAN BLUE EYES TO LISTEN. Long story short? I came here for an oil change, but am now getting like $300 worth of service done.

2736 2018-07-27 17:32:27 and BC just made it so much worse. I was suicidal. But lately I’ve been using CBD oil and it has helped me WONDERS. I used to just try to smoke a lot but the straight CBD helps me so much!
2737 2018-07-27 17:32:26 YEAH. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ANNOYED ME ABOUT MARTHA'S RECIPE AND MANY OTHERS.  WHY IS THERE FUCKING CANOLA OIL IN THIS SHIT?
2738 2018-07-27 17:31:53 We have oil underground because there was no bacteria that could break down plant fibers. Eventually nature will overcome plastic, but humans will be long gone by then.
2739 2018-07-27 17:31:47 That's not God's gift. That is just sheer luck they are born there in this particular time. Nobody will care about this oil in next 15-20 years.
2740 2018-07-27 17:31:47 Hi Amy - pls note that Peter Mandelson is the chair of trustees at the DM. It will take overwhelming support from other trustees to fully divest from arms, oil and unethical fiscal sources to overturn his likely position on the matter. As a contributing artist, I hope they do.
2741 2018-07-27 17:31:37 And it uses butter not oil. Which trust me is like key in making cakes. Just make sure you cream the butter and sugar together til it's fluffy light and white.
2742 2018-07-27 17:31:26 I'm still spending every day trying to figure out a logical way to bring her back.
2743 2018-07-27 17:31:21 recently bought a facial gua sha tool and I use it in the morning with a little grape seed oil, I love it!! The tool gets cold during the night and it’s really refreshing to do it in the morning. I also think my face has become less puffy after using it for a couple weeks!

2746 2018-07-27 17:31:10 Everyone buys oil and gas from RUSSIA! So what???!!! Our sanctions have NADA to do with the trade between Germany and Russia. But do explain your level of BS... why shouldn’t they buy gas and oil from them, especially since Dump is trying to blow up NATO?
2747 2018-07-27 17:31:08 They are many who want to destroy #Tesla and prevent the development of EV’s.  “Big Oil” is one of these - they will lose tons of money when EVs become mainstream - especially the trucks
2748 2018-07-27 17:31:05 Side note, but I cannot recommend carrying around fragrance free sensitive skin baby wipes around with you all the time strongly enough.  Keeps my face from being an oil slick halfway through the day.

2783 2018-07-27 17:26:31 I’ve been taking 20mg of CBD oil (no THC). It doesn’t make me “feel” anything, it’s more of the lack of or lesser feelings of stress and anxiety throughout the day. You can get it at head shops, probably even in Tennessee. It’s not illegal.
2784 2018-07-27 17:26:26 These unjustified invasions called war against terrorists R now transparent & predictable. The dirty game of stealing, raping & pillaging nations with oil, drug trade or WTF ever they want 2 take. New alliances have been formed & their gangOfThieves has more members 4 power & $$$
2785 2018-07-27 17:26:13 REMEMBER EDWIN FROM OIL NIGHTS? Well he’s still trying to pry on girls and hasn’t paid his performers. HOW CAN WE GET THIS SCUMBAG OUT OF OUR INDUSTRY! Any man who treats us like this doesn’t deserve our presence
2786 2018-07-27 17:26:00 Definitely a lot of us in this club! I tried everything but CBD oil. Ambien(obvi not all natural) has been the only thing to shut my brain down at night and keep it down. During the day I have a coffee that has PEA(calming) and L-Theanine, amino acid anti-anxiety extracts.
2787 2018-07-27 17:25:40 America doesn't have oil?? 

It isn't about having it. It is about creating a demand for it.

2815 2018-07-27 17:22:39 Does auto insurance pay for oil changes, a new paint job, new tires, and will replace your vehicle if you wreck it in a DUI?

Because that’s what people expect health insurance to do.

2828 2018-07-27 17:21:09 Hi Doug! Although oilfield services providers are "optimistic", they are still very exposed to a financial market collapse and a #recession. I will always be bullish on #oil but I must admit that #WallStreet's exuberance (& massive bubbles) represent a big threat to the industry.
2829 2018-07-27 17:20:57 Hmmm... At that time weren't Chad & ExxonMobile working together to get Chad's oil to the coast?
2830 2018-07-27 17:20:43 Counterpoint: Globalized capital requires globalized regulation to keep it in check, and the EU is the closest thing to that which exists, being far more aggressive with banks, tech giants, and oil companies than any individual country could be.

2853 2018-07-27 17:18:24 didnt valenzuela invite oil companies to help develop the oil reserves? which led to its failure as these companies are heavily capital driven? wait im not sure but valenzuela handled it incredibly poorly, so much wasted potential
2854 2018-07-27 17:18:17 With reason and logic, how will an oil ship pass through its territory, if it has declared that it is a military force from the same state, which says that the Yemenis targeted a ship of Nafieh.

Some top bands in my country performed at highschool anniv/bday.
Didn make those bands less great til now-
2862 2018-07-27 17:17:00 I do not think that there are enough hedge funds and retail investors to dump those long positions on that those Intermediaries have cornered the crude oil market with.

2869 2018-07-27 17:16:26 Same as when crude oil is up, due to USA low stock pile, when crude oil is down, due to High supply...
2870 2018-07-27 17:16:08 Yep protecting the ozone and the Earth is really jumping the gun. Technology has been around for a long time for better fuel economy and electric cars. Oil companies usually buy up the patents and put them off to the side the same way AMI bought stories to kill.

2882 2018-07-27 17:14:36 Really? Parents waived reunification? I don't think so.

Plus, if all the white supremacist government types abhor the brown skins, why do they want to keep & adopt out these children?
 
It couldn't be for money.  They already have the National Parks future oil drilling proceeds.

2885 2018-07-27 17:14:33 The foundations laid in Lagos were solid, even any idiot in position would be afraid to do less. The State is blessed with visionary leaders too. Other States are not in any way near it; even the oil States are worse off; no vision, no voice in the midst of others, so no future.

2895 2018-07-27 17:13:38 Hellman’s teet undefeated ;).  No seriously, use olive oil and add garlic and it’s Aioli.  Served in the finest restaurants of the world.  People need to relax.  I know it’s cute to hate Mayo.  But seriously.  A chicken salad without any mayo?  Enjoy choking that down
2896 2018-07-27 17:13:38 Ahh didn't think of that but should have since much of this is about Oil
2897 2018-07-27 17:13:37 Castor oil will help but honestly i never had a regimen. After I take these box braids out I’m going to attempt to take better care of my hair because I know it’s not as long (still long tho)

Moisture is the trick. I hear wild growth oil good too
2898 2018-07-27 17:13:36 What's this? What kind of medical insurance can you get for six cents a trip? This was rejected by 2 NYC Comptrollers who refused to sign off on it and two judges.

2908 2018-07-27 17:12:17 Toyota continues to expand its work on Fool Cell vechiles, despite the obvious. This unvailed ruse for increased oil industry polution is a direct attempt to exploit the public with misinformation.
2909 2018-07-27 17:12:10 because some folks are too small in their heads to understand/appreciate value of anything..a lifetime of knowledge and experiences is reduced to a algo or an indicator they need to possses..what's the price on e=mc^2?:)

2918 2018-07-27 17:11:26 Better yet, what would be the car insurance equivalent of ACA? Everyone must purchase car insurance, cars must have a sunroof, oil changes and gas must be included, your car insurance now causes $2K per month.

2927 2018-07-27 17:10:46 Margarine can be made from pretty much any vegetable oil. Acorns, horse chestnuts, water lily roots can be processed into flour. Soylent Green tastes of gammon and Deep Heat rub. #adequatefood
2928 2018-07-27 17:10:44 You will never fully understand how naturally LOUD your house is until you have a newborn and every single noise is like a bomb going off. Every floor board is loose. Every door needs 10 liters of oil. The toilet might as well be a nuclear bomb. #newbornbaby
2929 2018-07-27 17:10:44 Weird looking sun rings (makes it look like an eye) and oil spill looking clouds supposedly it’s atmospheric ice. Originally thought a Vegas thing but saw them last time I was in LA. England. Florida having them too. Micro pollution maybe
2930 2018-07-27 17:10:41 Then maybe switch to shea butter or coconut oil. But not moisturizing your skin isn't good. Just curious, do you also not use shampoo and conditioner? Or are you a bar shampoo person?

2944 2018-07-27 17:09:34 Debt has us over an oil barrel. Depressing as hell. Imagine if instead of Muskrat we’d chosen, say, to be a leader in wind/wave/solar energy. Compare with current fate of enslaved to oil revenues just to keep er chugging along towards god knows what. Didn’t have to be this way.

2949 2018-07-27 17:08:55 Krill oil is supposed to be way better.
2950 2018-07-27 17:08:50 They should make it a thing where someone can come pick up your vehicle while you’re at work and take it to get the oil changed, tires rotated/balanced, etc. Cause I need that person
2951 2018-07-27 17:08:22 When I was young my parents took me on a trip to Europe. I've forgotten basically everything about that trip, except when we visited the Prado Museum.

I saw Francisco Goya's "Saturn Devouring His Son" oil painting there.

To this day, nothing else has disturbed me quite as much.
2952 2018-07-27 17:08:17 They want to be deep in debt -- debt they never can or will pay -- when the oil runs out
2953 2018-07-27 17:08:10 The bill doesn't say there will be drilling in the parks, and the funding comes from *all* energy development, not just oil.
2954 2018-07-27 17:08:01 I hope they drill for oil on your street
2955 2018-07-27 17:07:43 I keep planes in the sky by adding oil to the engines
2956 2018-07-27 17:07:32 That is going to be one giant #ScottPruitt influenced miserable chart!!! Maybe if his daughter takes Prof. Jaffe's class, she can learn something to take home to her Daddy to tell @EPAAWheeler & other big oil/gas/chem/coal purchased people in office!!!

2959 2018-07-27 17:07:15 Study said even vegetarian women found them less attractive. Women want the beefcake. Also a vegetarian in your family means cooked meals are more complicated to make. Plus, cooking everything with meat on the side means favors don't mix right and ends up using more cooking oil.

2976 2018-07-27 17:05:10 Jean Paul Getty built one of the largest fortunes of his time. His oil concern, Getty Oil, inherited as a smalltime drilling outfit from his much storied father, was perhaps the most recognizable name in the business after John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil.

Still drinking fluoride water and eating GMO-food, right?
2982 2018-07-27 17:04:26 Lol on the Venezuela fear. Do people not realize that Chavez ran as a populist in the same way Trump did and then used his presidency to benefit himself and drive his once oil rich country to the ground. Venezuela is not a socialist country, it’s a dictatorship...

2997 2018-07-27 17:02:01 Oil pulling is believed to help in the excretion of toxic heavy metals by saliva. Oil pulling activates salivary enzymes which absorb toxins such as chemical toxins, bacterial toxins and environmental toxins from the blood and removed from the body through the tongue.

3011 2018-07-27 17:00:34 We are now exporting LNG and oil.  Huge amount of steel is being produced and those steel and aluminum jobs pay very high wages and so do all the oil and LNG jobs. This is only now getting started.

Then wind sheep wool with natural oil around stoma. Karya gum washer also. Wool used to unwing and fall into bag after a day, karya washer dissolved too.
3023 2018-07-27 16:59:49 $USO #OIL this down move ????
3024 2018-07-27 16:59:40 So far they have been shown to be just as shady as others, big pharmaceutical, oil, etc they all have influenced laws in the USA. If you don’t see that then you must only see what you want to see.
3025 2018-07-27 16:59:37 Weird that people aren't talking about "transitory" effect of oil price changes anymore
3026 2018-07-27 16:59:37 Hard sell off in oil now.

3029 2018-07-27 16:59:28 Let me tell y’all how good this @RickRoss beard oil smells. Accidentally got some on my upper lip while smelling it and I’ve been looking crazy at work ever since 
3030 2018-07-27 16:59:20 Well I'm here for maybe 3-4 more weeks...
3031 2018-07-27 16:59:18 CBD oil for pain management. Yes or no?
3032 2018-07-27 16:59:18 There are not a lot of democratic countries that produce oil and gas. Norway alone is not enough and american LNG is not cheap.
3033 2018-07-27 16:59:17 And then at night I cleanse again and use a night cream. I've been mixing it with two drops of an oil that I have. I have a lot of samples, I'm just trying to use them all.
3034 2018-07-27 16:59:16 Now if fuel prices drop, American's will have more $$ in their pockets to shoot the economy up further. POTUS Clinton green lighted more refineries, not a peep for over 25 years from the oil companies. What gives?
3035 2018-07-27 16:59:10 Just be sure to moisturize afterwards. Tea tree oil can be drying.
3036 2018-07-27 16:59:07 Will post more charts for the weekend alot of charts. I know I wasn't here mostly this week but was really busy in the forum and that is where my attention has been lately. Will post many updates this weekend. Natgas, OIL, Copper etc...
3037 2018-07-27 16:59:05 Giiiiiiiirl drink absolutely nothing but water no soda and all that other bullshit. And after I wash my face I put rosehip oil on. I think the oil helped fade the marks and the water helped keep my skin hydrated.
3038 2018-07-27 16:58:57 Does sun dried tomatoes in olive oil count?
3039 2018-07-27 16:58:49 It is time to excommunicate the clergy if they desire to Islamize society - the idiot can’t work out why most Muslim majority nations are inferior in science and modernity - oil saved Mecca because Western capitalists saw money and developed backward areas ...
3040 2018-07-27 16:58:41 we have of  crude oil well that we can sell in Nigerian and we are looking for foreign investor that can able to invest in crude oil well in Nigeria in delta state to sew a serious buyer to contact us and in serious investors should you contact me here on  so we can able to chat

3047 2018-07-27 16:57:35 I be seein grown men out here who don't know how to take care of they facial hair. They don't use no comb, brush, beard oil. None of that

If you don't take care of your facial hair, you don't deserve to have it.
3048 2018-07-27 16:56:58 Why oil changes gotta take 2 hours 
3049 2018-07-27 16:56:45 Fascinating subject. We had a lady in last year who gave her son cannabis oil. He was given days to live. She said she had nothing to lose - so gave him the cannabis oil. Years later he’s alive and well. I may well be in touch x

3077 2018-07-27 16:53:13 I need my oil
3078 2018-07-27 16:53:06 So oil is responsible for actions of evil dictators? Nations in the Middle East use oil for themselves and willingly sell to other nations. You're blaming oil for cultural conditions that have existed for thousands of years? I guess oil is also to blame for WWI and WWII?

3090 2018-07-27 16:51:19 Love that good can of oil
3091 2018-07-27 16:50:55 It’s a whole process that I have been part of from inception due to local content policies & hard to see how government insensitive to the oil sector as lead to seismic jobs lost .The impact is just huge & enormous. All due to present govt lack of knowledge of the oil sector.2/2
3092 2018-07-27 16:50:50 So... niggas just don’t have cooking oil at the crib now huh? What a life.

Would you try Hemp Oil?
3097 2018-07-27 16:50:16 We have nothing but oil in this backwards town
3098 2018-07-27 16:50:15 BTW, with so much glaring truth in _just_ the numbers alone, it's easy to focus on this entire situation from merely a financial perspective. But your added touch of the solar panels, against the backdrop of the oil tanker, is _pure genius_!!
3099 2018-07-27 16:50:11 Time for a oil change..
3100 2018-07-27 16:50:07 Hmmm. But I found an easier that keeps it like new.
Boil hot water and liquid or powdered soap, removes oil and smells fresh

3108 2018-07-27 16:49:16 Incidentally, there is one flaw in your idea.
Even with independence Shetland would be completely surrounded by Scottish waters and would have to come to some agreement to export oil over or through our land and seabed...

3111 2018-07-27 16:49:08 Totally agree, I was listening to this podcast where a guy made an algorithm to help cyclers cycle faster in the Tour de France, took him years to build it, now people want that algo for free, like he owes it to them
3112 2018-07-27 16:49:08 I mix it with the oil or?
3113 2018-07-27 16:48:53 What about wages??  Haven't they remained flat??   We're polluting like crazy - but hey no climate change right??  To add insult to injury in the name of the almighty dollar for big oil - we're even ok with sacrificing endangered species, including the bald eagle.
3114 2018-07-27 16:48:46 These THC oil pens done hit the market and caused havoc
3115 2018-07-27 16:48:33 Just look for Red Oil and rob it on a spatula and take on the buttocks megally.
3116 2018-07-27 16:48:29 Aloe and Vitamin E helped mine! I also recommend Tea tree oil, it significantly reduces the redness and inflammation.
3117 2018-07-27 16:48:13 The world's most value resource is BigData, no longer oil or gold , BigData is a revolution for the World and humantiy , BigData and AI will change economies , will change life view , will change strategies of Cooperations and exactly we expect it will help gender equality
3118 2018-07-27 16:48:06 I agree and I live in AB. We need to increase green energy only, not oil production. It’s a backwards plan and devastating for earth. Yes, we need oil now, but should be decreasing yearly with green growth, not increasing. It’s just common sense.
3119 2018-07-27 16:47:49 So I’ve just had a facial so I’ve got oil all over my face but I’m now stuck in Leeds train station due to the trains being fucked and everyone is looking at me like a big sweaty mess

3121 2018-07-27 16:47:36 -oils such as castor oil, petroleum jelly, vitamin e oil, and olive oil can help increase lash growth
-simply, at night, apply the oil along the roots of the lashes with a q-tip or an empty CLEAN mascara wand and coat the lashes
-then the next morning wash off

3124 2018-07-27 16:46:58 “It’d be nice to work in a place like this, and bake.” The smell was much nicer than her usual job. Coffee beans over oil any day.

“Thank you.” She picked up her muffin to pinch a bite off to eat.

3127 2018-07-27 16:46:48 MMT says that, but they're not politically savvy.  JG would benefit capital if min wage repealed (as MMT advocates) and JG wage was low.  Yet MMT sells JG to public by promising "good jobs" at $15/hr or whatever. Snake oil.

3137 2018-07-27 16:45:49 FALSE? Middle East Oil is false? Congolese Coltan (without which there would be no iPhone) is false?

Do you know where Apple buys coltan from? Which major World market? None, because all of it is plundered for America.

3148 2018-07-27 16:45:10 @MustacheDave_ although I could use a recommendation on a good beard shampoo/conditioner and oil.  Have an opinion on GIBS guys into beard stuff?
3149 2018-07-27 16:45:10 Use an olive oil sprayer to add flavor to salads, chicken, fish, or pasta. A 2-second spray evenly distributes about ½ teaspoon of oil, compared to the tablespoon or more you might get when pouring. You'll save calories but still enjoy flavor. #eatsmartlviesmarter
3150 2018-07-27 16:45:09 The world's most value resource is BigData, no longer oil or gold , BigData is a revolution for the World and humantiy , BigData will change economies , will change life view , will change strategies of Cooperations and exactly we expect it will help gender equality
3151 2018-07-27 16:44:51 -use a waterproof mascara to hold a lash curl, if your lashes are stubborn
-put eyeliner on the eyeline to accentuate the look of having thicker roots
-avoid eye rubbing
-use a q-tip and rub oil along the roots of the eyelashes (cont.)

3157 2018-07-27 16:44:24 ハゲてないもん、、、
3158 2018-07-27 16:44:19 Sad news: once proud Chesapeake is at risk of bankruptcy & is selling its interests in Utica Shale for $2B. Utica, #CHK's crown jewel, remains a prolific #natgas play, but early hopes for oil died after geologists found that hydrocarbons would need 100 million more years to cook.
3159 2018-07-27 16:44:18 Each Venezuelan should be richer than a Saudi. Bigger powers must be causing this to keep Venezuela out of the oil market. So they support this communist evil government.
3160 2018-07-27 16:44:15 the Glazers aren't better owners though, as I said they are parasites,  that also made their money from being parasites by the way as well as from oil and gas. But I guess we know why you really don't like the City owners.
3161 2018-07-27 16:44:11 So - I have A LOT to learn about oils.
Ehat is your favourite to use and why? (not brand but oil type/scent)
3162 2018-07-27 16:44:06 I’ll have a chopped salad, double-meat tuna, oil/vinegar, w/everything but pickles.
3163 2018-07-27 16:44:02 I can be fighting with my roomie and still use his oil to fry my egg. You can't come and let this small beef affect my rights.
3164 2018-07-27 16:44:01 You can see the white froth of oil almost every where nasty......just spoke to biker confirms SLIPPERY
3165 2018-07-27 16:43:42 I stay coming and spending my money at the oil bar in south lake i just love a sweet candy smell 
3166 2018-07-27 16:43:38 folks don't know how to be thankful/appreciative for what they get in life..never share..and then have the audacity to ask..'why don't you give everything you have have to me:')
3167 2018-07-27 16:43:23 Hahahahaha noooo "baby oil" 
3168 2018-07-27 16:43:17 If an asteroid wiped out humanity, burying our bodies far beneath the surface, under huge pressure and heat for millions of years, turning us into oil. What are the chances of intelligent species coming to life, extracting us, molding us into colorful shafts?
3169 2018-07-27 16:43:13 If one eats mostly vegan junk like refined sugar and oil or is on a hypocaloric diet, protein might become an issue at some point. Otherwise, relax and don't worry about it; your protein intake will be sufficient.
3170 2018-07-27 16:43:06 ...(2/2) They could not clean the catch basin without dripping water, oil, dirt, and grime all over the bike that was locked up there. However, We have dispatched another crew that should arrive by 2pm.

3173 2018-07-27 16:42:56 Shortsighted and destructive. We should keep the oil in the ground, and in no world should we authorize drilling in national parks - funding park maintenance with petrodollars is like funding schools from gun sales to children.

3181 2018-07-27 16:42:26 If yo boyfriend put lotion/baby oil on his whole/entire body..... He yo girlfriend
3182 2018-07-27 16:42:25 I also went out with coconut oil in my hair because it’s so ... me: my hair is not healthy and I need to get it in shape
3183 2018-07-27 16:42:16 Thank you! It’s tough. Here til 7th Aug...
Not trying to change minds, simply point out small things here and there. 
I started with what mass deregulation means in real terms. Like shooting  bears, coastal oil drilling, bringing class action lawsuits against large Corps.
3184 2018-07-27 16:42:14 WTI oil at $69.50/barrel, near unchanged.
3185 2018-07-27 16:42:08 Secunder Kermani obviously tells the truth and nothing but the truth. Lol. Pity!
3186 2018-07-27 16:42:05 Remember Supermarket Sweeps? I’m at Walmart waiting for my oil change and considering playing it alone.
3187 2018-07-27 16:41:57 더워 죽겟네
3188 2018-07-27 16:41:41 Fun facts: 
The US economy continues to benefit more from higher oil prices than lower oil prices. 
Energy structures and equipment added more to GDP than TOTAL structures and equipment.
3189 2018-07-27 16:41:30 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the in the wiring closet with the dagger!
3190 2018-07-27 16:41:29 Getting my car fixed after realizing that the passive aggressive approach wasn't working. "Gee, it would be really great if the oil stayed in you."
3191 2018-07-27 16:41:26 BECAUSE I AM 5 YEARS OLD BABY HAH!

But seriously i can not use that oil. Ah sorry i am wrong. I mean telon balsam. Sometimes telon balsam also over hot for me.
3192 2018-07-27 16:41:25 These are the reserves that the remain campaign said didn’t exist etc. Of course Scotland (or the UK) can’t depend on it, but it’s icing. It’s only the oil price that has subdued exploration.
3193 2018-07-27 16:41:23 If I was NL Premier (No intentions!), I'd put the oil & gas profits onto Muskrat Falls costs. And then go crazy on cost cutting to get rest of budget in line with regular revenues-- Closing out towns, schools, ferries. I'd be unpopular with some but the majority will say Finally!
3194 2018-07-27 16:41:16 You know it's too hot outside when the coconut oil inside is melting on its own. #heatwave #heatwaveproblems #HeatWave2018
3195 2018-07-27 16:41:09 well everyone I’m very proud to say that after 4 months of needing an oil change I finally did some adulting & did it (: no one ask me to do anything for another 4 months.
3196 2018-07-27 16:41:03 Are you a hydro one customer? Do you drive a lot and have to buy gas once/twice a week? Have an oil or propane furnace heating your home? Do you run a rural small business that has a lot of overhead? Do you have stuff delivered regularly to that rural small business?
3197 2018-07-27 16:41:03 Oil lab on an Arleigh Burke
3198 2018-07-27 16:41:02 Oil. Money. Homophobia. Own the libs. Read "The Road to Unfreedom" by Tim Snyder if you want the long answer. Or check his stuff out on youtube.
3199 2018-07-27 16:40:30 Getting rid of plastic leads to absolutely massive deforestation and it takes more oil to make paper items. This whole anti-plastic movement is a corporate-government scam.

3201 2018-07-27 16:40:11 Anyways I heard Black Seed Oil is the new wave...
3202 2018-07-27 16:40:10 it’s my day off and I’m going to the DMV and getting my oil changed. Adulting
3203 2018-07-27 16:40:09 rose hip seed oil!
3204 2018-07-27 16:40:09 Use Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Extra virgin olive oil is the healthiest fat on the planet.
It is loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that can fight inflammation

3206 2018-07-27 16:40:03 #BREAKING:
Wonder why California has Brown outs?
**California claims they have "Clean Energy" meanwhile they pay other states who use Oil, Coal to provide Electricity.
**They removed their energy producers, added one of the highest rates on customers - who must rely on others.
3207 2018-07-27 16:39:55 Reckon there would be a lot of sunshine in that part of the world too. Big oil interests would never allow it.
3208 2018-07-27 16:39:46 How is America responsible for Assad killing his own people & terrorists are crossing turkish borders & Turkish government buying ISIS stolen oil? How is USA responsible for Houthi killing everyone & hijaking a whole country?

3210 2018-07-27 16:39:29 I hate getting my oil changed. I feel like I'm being pressured to buy drugs by every single worker. Like get out of my face 
3211 2018-07-27 16:39:28 I have replaced eggs and oil in recipes with Mayo.
Another thing on the Net is adding Cola and whole Milk.
What do you get? Queso Fresco. Drain the whey off . .delicious
3212 2018-07-27 16:39:16 Many in Alberta knew the #NDP had to open up markets for our oil.

We have 1/3 of the total oil reserves in the world and 98% of the cars burn gas.

We also currently have a #ClimatePlan - get rid of All coal fired electricity generation.

3213 2018-07-27 16:39:15 Better owner .... if you put finance above all else. Oil money from a corrupt state.

3216 2018-07-27 16:38:51 I am looking at buying some land in Georgia. Definitely far enough out that I can fix up an outdoor range of sorts.
3217 2018-07-27 16:38:44 WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE YOU. Man, telon oil is nothing compared to minyak kayu putih :(
3218 2018-07-27 16:38:42 Venezuela must recuperate it’s oil production infrastructure and diversify it’s economy.
3219 2018-07-27 16:38:35 That may just be loose skin and not fat. If I may suggest you do a massage daily with alternate day almond and coconut oil. It will improve the elasticity of the skin and with your exercising the elasticity will speed its disappearance!
3220 2018-07-27 16:38:07 i hate when food is drenched in oil.
3221 2018-07-27 16:38:01 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
3222 2018-07-27 16:37:57 It was frizzy when it was hot. Get Moroccan Oil on it and calm down!
3223 2018-07-27 16:37:55 Snake oil salesman that failed “flipping the shrimp in the hat” trick. #DrHo
3224 2018-07-27 16:37:53 When you accidentally flirt with a cashier over oil paints and he gives you coupons to cut like $30 off you purchase
3225 2018-07-27 16:37:41 You miss spelled “oil money there”
3226 2018-07-27 16:37:40 the frothiness of #buttercoffee ...lowkey don’t mind the layer of oil at the top when it’s not blended
3227 2018-07-27 16:37:37 I do my own moisturizing facial spray: (70% rose water+ 30% pure glycerin oil )and every time I add another essential oil to the bottle depending on the month / current skin condition. Example: Now its 5 drops of jojoba oil.
3228 2018-07-27 16:37:22 Today a pipe bomb was found in a parking lot near the oil refinery. While the police were distracted the bank was robbed. Coincidence? I think not!
3229 2018-07-27 16:37:20 Good luck! 
3230 2018-07-27 16:37:14 I can not use that oil because too hot and smell not good. I only can use telon oil.
3231 2018-07-27 16:37:13 CBD oil obtained life is well
3232 2018-07-27 16:37:11 The smokiness of the chiles, the smoothness of the oil, the capsaicin balanced by a little bit of sour, a little bit of sweet... it's getting toward pepper harvest now, they toss chiles in a rotating wire drum, come out flexible like leather. I opened a fresh 10# bag once.... :)
3233 2018-07-27 16:37:01 What isn't govt decreasing taxes on oil prices,country runs on fuel not clothes and cosmetics.
3234 2018-07-27 16:36:51 Please do! We'll go to the shooting range during the day and party at night!
3235 2018-07-27 16:36:41 overall bonds and $OIL holding up pretty well.....
3236 2018-07-27 16:36:38 You've listed some seriously powerful items.  Why do you believe RSO did most of the work?  Because it's cannabis oil?  Is it possible it was enhanced by the other items you listed?  I've never used RSO but have heard it's incredible.
3237 2018-07-27 16:36:34 #DrHo is a glum flam quack snake oil salesman. Bet he can catch a shrimp in his hat, too. #days
3238 2018-07-27 16:36:20 + the cost of extracting oil varies from one place to another depending on geology, quality of process, and quality of the equipments!
3239 2018-07-27 16:36:10 Just like u people sold arms to terrorist to pay for guns for contras (Regans Iran-contra affair), or u people lied about WMD for oil (bush)?
3240 2018-07-27 16:36:06 Right.  These guys want everybody to keep getting screwed over by big oil - already $3.00 gallon on Long Island - and by polluting internal combustion engines -
3241 2018-07-27 16:36:00 No, me either.

What's worse is that there's often poison ivy in bogs, and when that burns, the oil goes airborn.

It's probably not a big deal for people miles away, but if you're next door to a 'controlled burn'...
3242 2018-07-27 16:35:56 You know, a bunch of cliches about "economic war." The US want Venezuela's oil. They cannot stand Venezuela as an example of resistance. The US see Russian, Cuban, Chinese influence in Venezuela as dangerous. Blah Blah Blah.
3243 2018-07-27 16:35:51 Wen u talk of this oil bloc, are all the current owners from the South? Shey no be North d majority dey? Besides he own cattles see where that got us...

3246 2018-07-27 16:35:38 I need a oil change
3247 2018-07-27 16:35:34 Probably just the intensity of the rain. Or could be the rain emulsifying with oil / pollutants.
3248 2018-07-27 16:35:29 Serious question. Has anyone ever ate at Blimpie Subs and Salads, their sign looks like a place I’d get my oil changed at
3249 2018-07-27 16:35:18 Uhm no...we got rid of all the baby stuff.  Oldest asked for another sibling, told them I'm too old. My younger brothers both in their early 20s say our kids are the best birth control EVER! They're wicked smart.
3250 2018-07-27 16:35:16 I’m getting an oil change. They have the “History” channel on. They claim DaVinci and anyone smarter than them has been contacted by aliens  this is why we aren’t getting smarter people. #turntheTVoff.
3251 2018-07-27 16:35:03 I'm at the cafe and this german tourist just dipped a whole slice of bread in a bowl of olive oil and ate it like that I'm wheezing.

3253 2018-07-27 16:34:55 I’ve been simultaneously calling places for fresh lavender while working & it just came to me I could just use lavender essential oil . I just like to stress myself out clearly

3257 2018-07-27 16:34:24 The corrupt oil and gas industry at work again.
3258 2018-07-27 16:34:16 ??? Is this on the cotw intro? U should put a mundane curse on them. like u hope they spill oil on their new skirt and it's hard to notice but they'll know its there even if no one else does. Those are the best.

3263 2018-07-27 16:33:00 Got an oil change yesterday and the dude popped out the cabin air filter. Literally had close to an inch of dirt/leaves on it. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been touched before lol I didn't even know it was a thing
3264 2018-07-27 16:32:52 Is the EU going to stockpile / waste millions of tons of food they subsidise just to teach the Brits a lesson ? Wine, cheese, dairy, salads, olive oil etc Will they want more wine lakes, butter mountains, milk lakes, beef mountains ? or do remainers know nothing of these ?

3270 2018-07-27 16:32:16 I always go for something super light so I would always use olive oil. I tend to use infused oils (some have rose, steel cut oats, or other moisturizing ingredients) in my daily/weekly routine outside of washing and oil rinsing
3271 2018-07-27 16:32:05 When I have them, I use aromatherapy with Lavender Oil. I really helped through some tough times. I hate when people tell you just get over it. Hope you are feeling better now.
3272 2018-07-27 16:32:05 Girl same. I made an exchange and got an oil change/tire rotation, and my car inspected before noon! #girlpower
3273 2018-07-27 16:32:04 I get that argument, but the oil market is manipulated by OPEC and there are a number of Oil ETFs approved by the SEC

3282 2018-07-27 16:30:30 It seems obvious, unless you are a politician bought and paid for by the oil & gas industry, which the entire GOP is.
3283 2018-07-27 16:30:17 Fresh oil of joy be poured from the divine Child on all flesh. 
3284 2018-07-27 16:30:09 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
3285 2018-07-27 16:30:09 Please tell me you're not pushing that "big pharma has a secret cure for cancer" argument? That originated with David "Avocado" Wolfe in order to sell more alternative medicine snake oil.
3286 2018-07-27 16:30:03 Me at the dealership while my car is getting an oil change “sooo can I get a rental car so I can go get my eyebrows done”
3287 2018-07-27 16:30:03 Le gas oil est un carburant cancérigène et c'est un grand bien de l'augmenter
3288 2018-07-27 16:29:42 Infrastructure cost are critical. The costs of building & maintaining the endless miles of new residential roads alone is outrageous and hugely dependent on cheap and abundant oil—not only for transporting materials and operating machinery but for asphalt for the roads themselves
3289 2018-07-27 16:29:41 They actually can’t get poison ivy! The oil just sticks to their hair. Can stay up to 5 yrs on anything so that’s why it’s so important to wash anything you touched. But you are right, my last dog would never let us know he was in pain & he couldn’t even walk
3290 2018-07-27 16:29:20 Cremas oil free
3291 2018-07-27 16:29:15 I had lunch already, AND they use palm oil in the recipe. Palm oil is bad
3292 2018-07-27 16:29:13 Going on vacation as a kid was so simple you just packed your clothes... but now I make sure the tires are in good shape, oil level is solid, make sure we got everything especially for Journey, quadruple check to make sure the hotel is booked for the right dates.. etc

#USOIL – #Oil mixed as price struggles to move higher, volumes were low but #investors may increase their positions on week-end flows. WTI stable near $69 per barrel. @StavrosTousios #FXPRIMUS
3294 2018-07-27 16:28:59 Here is the deal people. ROBOTS, ROBOTS, and ROBOTS, are replacing human workforce. Want a future for your family and yourself? Get a clue then an education. OR, open a Buggy Whip factory, or an Ice house, or Whale oil and street gaslight service.
3295 2018-07-27 16:28:46 dry shampoo (washing less really helped my hair grow) and biotin!!! I also use a tea tree oil shampoo!
3296 2018-07-27 16:28:40 I do! Its gross an smelly an i hate it lol. I work on oil n gas sites alot n its so friggin hot it gets unbearable some days.
3297 2018-07-27 16:28:39 Their sweets all contain the dreaded palm oil, real fucken ethical
3298 2018-07-27 16:28:21 A country sitting on the biggest oil reserves on the planet and it's people are starving. This is deliberate. The communist government wants Venezuelans to die.
3299 2018-07-27 16:28:15 Well, would you rather be skinned, cut into slices and then thrown into boiling oil or discreetly hide in the bottom drawer of the fridge until you are wrinkly and get thrown out onto the compost? I'd say smart move by the carot and squash there.
3300 2018-07-27 16:28:14 Is this tweet a joke? Are you for real @GovernorTomWolf? You’ve accepted $98,000 from oil and gas. YOU are choosing to do business with oil and gas rather than fight for a change! #youngandnaive #informedvoters #onetermtom #defendwhatyoulove #bethechange
3301 2018-07-27 16:28:14 after I buy something I read only the positive reviews so I can validate my purchase/ life. today's example- rosehip oil, which will give me a baby's skin, perfect teeth, and healthy stock options
3302 2018-07-27 16:27:58 Sorry I'm going to miss the show this Saturday. I'm having a bunch of bankers and network security guys at my house for "Pie and Beer Day" party this Saturday. Wish you and Cami could come over...
3303 2018-07-27 16:27:44 so when i was in school , a guy was asking me out and i gave a silly excuse i dont like d cream u use, change it to goya oil
next day he bought it, i nevr meant it then
people would do silly things for love
3304 2018-07-27 16:27:43 @GOP please see the reason in renewables.  Please make the best decision for Puerto Rice! NOT the best decision for oil and gas companies.....
3305 2018-07-27 16:27:39 Oil change, one hour and 15 minutes ?
3306 2018-07-27 16:26:50 @IcelandRichard Hi Richard credit to you and your dad for ditching the palm oil I know things will maybe cost a touch more but hey hoo it's worth it to see them stop destroying the forrests. BUT where have the small boxes of suit Mai and har cau gone.#myfavouritesnack

3308 2018-07-27 16:26:31 When the petrol dollar wages war along side Russia to defend peak oil. You know it’s peak oil time.
3309 2018-07-27 16:26:20 ustzh x try micellar oil?? garnier ade x silap
3310 2018-07-27 16:26:20 *takes car to get oil changed* 
worker: “ma’am you need new brakes” 
me: “oh really bc i got them replaced like 3 weeks ago” 
- JUST BC IM A GIRL DOESN’T MEAN IM STUPID
3311 2018-07-27 16:26:17 Venezuela announced today that it is removed 5 zeroes from it's currency. Before now, $1 is 120,000 Venezuelan Bolívar. Venezuela is the 11th largest oil producing country, ahead of Mexico and Nigeria. 

If we don't kill corruption, corruption will kill us.
3312 2018-07-27 16:26:05 Actually that happens when the pilot intentionally burns oil for a smoke effect. It’s part of the show. #NowYouKnow
3313 2018-07-27 16:26:01 Calouste Gulbenkian. He was a major investor in oil interests with Royal Dutch Shell, and held a 5 percent stake in the Iraq Petroleum Co.
3314 2018-07-27 16:25:53 Lmaooo that was apple cider vinegar mixed with water and black seed oil. I drank the diatomaceous earth solo lol
3315 2018-07-27 16:25:47 I found that the Balance oil from DoTerra helps me a lot. I also taught myself how to focus on talking myself out of the attack and channeling it towards other thoughts to take my mind off of it.
3316 2018-07-27 16:25:45 Doing a oil change on my car without a mechanic Like a man
3317 2018-07-27 16:25:43 @SONEZ00 안녕하세용 트친소 흔적 남겨주셔서 왔습니다. *^-^*
3318 2018-07-27 16:25:43 Pat, maybe you’re coming at this from the cost of the marginal barrel?  Still some room here too IMHO.  AND many Permian oil men would complete DUCs at $45 wellhead.  So still a ways to go... Esp. If WTI makes even a small run toward mid $70s
3319 2018-07-27 16:25:27 Subprime mortgages and electric cars are two different things.  Gas costs almost 3.00/gallon on Long Island - people are tired of getting screwed by big oil - #Tesla is one of answers.
3320 2018-07-27 16:25:20 ay eso pasa, i hate it. también puedes comprar en la farmacia Tea tree oil & te lo pones 2 veces al día hasta que se te vaya
3321 2018-07-27 16:25:13 Your body looks great with oil on it. Great show of your nipples. 
3322 2018-07-27 16:24:44 安定のアイチュウ運が死んでるからLEでねぇマン
3323 2018-07-27 16:24:36 Yep cheers will do, tbf I have a very slight fork oil weep which is the torture of leaks here, its a bastard to sort out and been on it for a while, there are 2 bolts at bottom of fork one is drain plug which is a twat to seal and the other nips into double damper & a bugger too
3324 2018-07-27 16:24:29 The oil companies set the price.
3325 2018-07-27 16:24:21 Lunch time in 7 mins pasta with grilled chicken Alfredo sauce broccoli spinach garlic oil carrots and iced tea with lemon
3326 2018-07-27 16:24:18 i come for an oil change & they doing extra shit 
3327 2018-07-27 16:24:13 Explaining what I do at my job now is basically like explaining like what I did college. 
Me: “Well, I work with oil and gas databases and monitor their current values and production..”
Them: *blank, glazed stare*
Me: “computers.. I work with computers” 
3328 2018-07-27 16:23:52 If you team with Jackson, he will give you his limited edition beard oil, a once in a lifetime opportunity
3329 2018-07-27 16:23:50 really in the mood for a mozzarella basil sun dried tomatoes olive oil and garlic on flat bread
3330 2018-07-27 16:23:38 I count down from ten slowly and take a long, deep breath in between each number. Sometimes it takes a couple rounds, but it helps me a lot! And I’ve been putting lavender and eucalyptus essential oil drops on my pillows at night and it rocks me to sleep immediately!
3331 2018-07-27 16:23:36 Look, I was bringing in billions. Not anymore (£0.2bn) so SNP ' don't mention the war' mentality with oil is all too obvious. Without oil revenue we run a large deficit. It cannot be argued against, so you cannot answer the analysis. It is correct.  Show what is wrong please.
3332 2018-07-27 16:23:24 I make my own lavender spritz with essential oil and water.

3336 2018-07-29 23:59:40 Depends on how thick they are applied, use of drying medium, humidity etc. ...I’m using a newer type of oil paint that says they will dry for varnish in about a month.

3389 2018-07-29 23:52:35 2- Cut back on greasy foods: One of the major causes of acne is excess oil.

3-Hands off your face: The amount of bacteria on your hands at any given time is almost uncomfortable to think about, and touching your face just means you’re putting that bacteria on your skin.
3390 2018-07-29 23:52:29 *coconut oil. Any type of oil really.

！！
3392 2018-07-29 23:52:01 Hey! We had one of those. Bought it and by 56,000 miles we had put 3 head gaskets, 3 timing chains, 3 oil pumps, 3 fuel pumps, 2 radios and a air duct to the left of the steering wheel came off. The final straw was when we took it back in for the 8th time and 1/2
3393 2018-07-29 23:51:56 I wish there was a body lotion/oil with this scent.
3394 2018-07-29 23:51:47 That's and a brake change the only things I know. And a oil change..
3395 2018-07-29 23:51:43 Bones don't turn to oil.
3396 2018-07-29 23:51:39 1- Change your pillowcase every week: your pillowcase is going to collect dirt and oil from your face and hair during the night, especially if you toss and turn, and that will then be what you put your face on each night.
3397 2018-07-29 23:51:31 My body isn't responding well to the heat and I have acne (??) All over my body. Which happens every year but this summer has been especially bad so I'm like a walking tea tree oil bottle.
3398 2018-07-29 23:51:21 I don’t know what direction the hair grows in at this point and baby oil irritates the hell outta my skin. It’s really sensitive.
3399 2018-07-29 23:51:04 Fursuit spray but with truffle oil fragrance.
3400 2018-07-29 23:50:55 I bet. Olive oil feels like it soaks because I never have a leakage problem with it, but maybe it's making it drier..especially if I skip a day without combing it out or something

3403 2018-07-29 23:49:55 probs just shattered my knee cap because dick head just tripped me on line. once there's oil on the floor you're beat.
3404 2018-07-29 23:49:29 Ok thats good...what about piling on the preasure to companies using palm oil! We all love the tiger already! - what is your strategy in relation to palm oil? What is your organisation doing to hi light the destruction caused by companies such as @Nestle multinational boycott!?
3405 2018-07-29 23:49:28 Usually I sprinkle ground cinnamon all over the house in the summer (messy) but this year I’ve been using peppermint oil which works really well! (Until the ants find a new entry.) 

Cinnamon oil is smarter because it’s getting a little menthol in here tbh

3407 2018-07-29 23:49:18 Sneaky Snake was never a working man. Other than working his mouth to sell his snake oil, he was for sure a con man
3408 2018-07-29 23:49:17 There will be no wealth in oil or coal if every country makes every effort to change, as much as possible, to renewables.
3409 2018-07-29 23:49:05 Stick with oil pens, gonna waste your money trying to vape it from a box mod
3410 2018-07-29 23:49:04 Nabors got a job fair next month if you wanna get you want to go oil field.
3411 2018-07-29 23:49:02 その通りw
3412 2018-07-29 23:48:44 しにそう
3413 2018-07-29 23:48:41 You had everything going for you - until this
3414 2018-07-29 23:48:32 Apparently we shouldn’t be using oil in our hair. Hair doesn’t treat oil like skin does and there’s no “sealing” moisture in hair, according to this cosmetologist I follow. She says it’s dirtying up your hair and making it greasy and it will make it drier if you have dry hair.

3419 2018-07-29 23:47:35 Flat leaf parsley, lemon juice, toasted slivered almonds, garlic, glug of some oil = not actually pesto, but like same concept

3424 2018-07-29 23:46:49 I cant wait to be part of this sector. I love oil and gas. I hope it falls within my area of knowledge.
3425 2018-07-29 23:46:32 This backdrop even reach to an extent that the indigenes of the area with the oil wealth goes to the extreme of putting petition on central government of why will their wealth be use in developing the other parts of the country.

3428 2018-07-29 23:46:08 Where's the name calling, you're delusional. The polls say most Canadians want the pipeline. The safest way to transport oil. Yet you have no problem having tankers full of Saudi oil. Do you not understand the revenue created by oil. Do you not get that green energy is not there
3429 2018-07-29 23:45:56 The UN was created after WWII. The UK did not want to upset its newly created Arab partner nations, especially rich oil emirates, etc... so chose to let the UN decide whether they should honor the Balfour Declaration and divide the Mandate into 2 states: one arab, 1 Jewish, 1947.
3430 2018-07-29 23:45:50 ... But yes, it's pure oil is defacto against ifra regulations (although there are lots of aromachem suppliers that provide a version with  Furocoumarin removed)
3431 2018-07-29 23:45:33 Or track record on pollution isn't great, if you think of various mining and oil sands problems and our propensity to export dirty and import clean without thinking too much about the environmental costs of making dirty clean.  We shouldn't beat ourselves up, but we can do better
3432 2018-07-29 23:45:30 15 Billion / Annually! 

That’s a lot of oil tankers you’re lobbying for!

3434 2018-07-29 23:45:12 It’s a tragic thing that grown adults fall for this nefarious criminal snake oil shit. That’s a good example of why faith is a maladaptive psychological trait. Not to mention mindless obedience to authority.

3440 2018-07-29 23:44:19 You lied saying that Mexico would pay for the wall just as Republicans lied saying that Iraq Oil would pay for the Iraq War. Y'know  the war based on Republican lies about Iraqi chemical weapons which didn't exist. Republicans wont fund schools or Healthcare, but love Wars.
3441 2018-07-29 23:44:11 No @BlairKing_ca , listen to what the gov’t of Canada have been repeatedly telling Canadians. That the #TMX is about that $15B / day that @JustinTrudeau says and the $4M / Week Scott Moe thinks he’s missing out on by not shipping oil through BC to Asia. All easily verified facts!
3442 2018-07-29 23:43:52 The rainy day fund was created to balance state tax revenue. It is funded entirely by the oil and gas industry. We should debate it, let’s make sure we understand the history first.
3443 2018-07-29 23:43:47 The the governmental policy of land tenure system does not provide a 100%  ownership of land, Hence the indigenes of the provinces where the oil is geographcaly located are claiming of having full right of the oil wealth.
3444 2018-07-29 23:43:36 This is disgraceful. All over oil. Aust should do the right thing & split profits 50/50. So Timor Lesté has its own money instead of relying on aid from the UN.

3455 2018-07-29 23:42:59 Try the argument with any other industry. Construction workers should have no rights, if they get hurt, that’s their problem. If train engineers die on the job, their family should have had private insurance. Oil rigs are dangerous jobs, but they pay well and workers should
3456 2018-07-29 23:42:53 Trump is the oil rig pumping death and damnation into the sea; he is permanent damage. But there is an investment on the part of authoritarians and gerrymanderers. They are willing to kill the very fish they need for preservation.  And we seem to like swimming in the scum.

3569 2018-07-29 23:28:03 Yea, except socialism didn't actually cause the crisis in Venezuela. Chavez systematically destroyed the country's only real source of income (the state oil company) to pay for his socialist policies. That doesn't mean those policies were the cause.

3571 2018-07-29 23:27:34 (^o^)
3572 2018-07-29 23:27:28 Tomorrow it begins for real. 64 teams in 3A start tomorrow with the same goal, and only 1 will be left standing in Lucas Oil on Thanksgiving weekend. 

In the meantime, sorry for all of the people I’m about to spend the next 4 months ignoring.
3573 2018-07-29 23:27:24 Including features like “don’t crash me, you’ll die”, “Jesus fuck where the fuck do I get one of these?”, and the much loved “uhhhh… where does that wire go?” 

I’m thinking more Toyota that I can just change the oil on and never open the hood on.
3574 2018-07-29 23:27:12 Keep your head up... there are many of us out there dealing with the same issues. I take CBD oil, it helps control the anxiety and knocks out a lot of my A.D.D. symptoms as well
3575 2018-07-29 23:26:53 ..medicinal cannibis oil might go down well - as it did 150 years ago..
3576 2018-07-29 23:26:49 My class was such a success. I love my Oil classes. They truly fill my cup.
3577 2018-07-29 23:26:47 @kl_oil
3578 2018-07-29 23:26:40 I’m in the shower and asked my nephew to hand me the oil and this nigga handed me listerine 
3579 2018-07-29 23:26:33 Jasam, a love so strong it had to be mandated. A couple with all the chemistry of oil and water. I can’t wait to watch the ratings fall.
3580 2018-07-29 23:26:31 an oil change finally?

3583 2018-07-29 23:25:59 Them Old Ass old people remedies never work and only makes things worse. Who else thought their grandparents was trying to kill them?!

Like...

Boiling castor oil for an ear infection.

3585 2018-07-29 23:25:49 Get your puppy CBD oil (marijuana oil) my dog suffers from seizures and since I started giving it to him he hasn’t had one, it’s been 4 months, some groomers sell all natural pumpkin cookies with it in them. It’s worth a try.
3586 2018-07-29 23:25:48 I’ve often wondered about Trump’s fetishy devotion to fossil fuels. The Russia connection is obvious. Does anyone know any more about that 19% of the Russian oil business that was in play before the election?
3587 2018-07-29 23:25:45 This. A bit of olive oil & giddy-up.
3588 2018-07-29 23:25:38 MATT 25
Chapter 25 
  1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 
2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.  
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

3592 2018-07-29 23:25:07 Refusing plastic grocery bags when I can. 

Opting for public transportation over driving.

Bringing my own utensils instead of using plastic forks. 

Small things, among other daily decisions, we can all do to cutback and put pressure on governments, big oil, and corporations.

3594 2018-07-29 23:24:45 I take every opportunity on that one!
Water expands to 1700 times it's liquid volume, instantaneously changing to steam when it hits fat at 300 degrees C!!!!!! The steam carries the fat with it and creates a vapour explosion. Water chucking numb nuts get covered in flaming oil!
3595 2018-07-29 23:24:44 Riassunto della giornata: parte zazzaroni “vuoi higuain, caccia i soldi”, procede bargiggia con svariati insulti ai tifosi milanisti, conclude tuna oil, sparando la più grossa cagata che io abbia mai sentito. Chiudete tuider

3599 2018-07-29 23:23:54 I really like it, too.  I had a '72 LeMans.  It died 10 years ago, now.  I still have parts and tools to work on one.  Now I have a '08 Dodge Charger.  Can't even change the oil without a lift now.
3600 2018-07-29 23:23:45 Healer, k2, suspicious partner. Panoorin nyo lahat.
3601 2018-07-29 23:23:13 No. Guy Fieri is the one who should be boiled in oil.
3602 2018-07-29 23:23:12 Maybe Trump has figured out how to steal the oil.
3603 2018-07-29 23:22:41 I too was born with permanent olive oil skin, shits rough
3604 2018-07-29 23:22:13 What is it going to take to impeach Trump, He like blame everyone else for his mistakes. And use his powers if he don't  get his way. Wake up America, let oil impeach him before he gets us in more trouble.
3605 2018-07-29 23:22:12 I finally bought some CBD oil and after using it and meditating, I’m pretty sure I’m more calm and relaxed than I’ve ever been. If you haven’t tried it, you need to.
3606 2018-07-29 23:22:08 You don't have olive oil and garlic in your house?! Are you okay?!!! Blink once for yes and twice for no!
3607 2018-07-29 23:22:04 Follow the oil trail....
3608 2018-07-29 23:21:51 I bake some garlic, drizzle some olive oil, eat it on some cheese and crackers. Garlic is good for your immune system!

3611 2018-07-29 23:21:02 It’s a small(ish), independent nation of some 4 million folks, lots of sheep & mountains. Not much oil. They had ca. 10% deficit which they turned around in a few years.
3612 2018-07-29 23:21:01 How much public land will he allowed to be destroyed selling it to coal&oil companies? How toxic will our air&water become?How long bf our power grids are compromised or the us dollar crashes?how many wars will he send our kids to die in?
3613 2018-07-29 23:20:59 Our roster?...what position do you play? Let me guess, you watch in your underwear work baby oil at the ready.....
3614 2018-07-29 23:20:58 This link mentions palm oil as healthy for cooking or dressing food but there's been a huge uptick in last few years of people saying to avoid palm oils.

What do you think is the basis for the hysteria against palm oil?
3615 2018-07-29 23:20:52 How about an adventure to Lucas Oil. It will take sacrifice.
3616 2018-07-29 23:20:47 Persuasive or not it was all the truth. Just as in Venezuela a kleptocracy is stealing vast sums of oil wealth. Iran should be a very advanced nation with nothing to fear. Instead there is poverty, paranoia and oppression. Sad.
3617 2018-07-29 23:20:46 My favorite “Essential Oil” is bacon grease. 
3618 2018-07-29 23:20:40 I’m interested in this
3619 2018-07-29 23:20:26 No PPE Ivanka I’m suprised u didn’t slip in some oil in those hills
3620 2018-07-29 23:20:24 This moron thinks Putin WANTS a stronger NATO & US military, fierce US gas & oil competition, a pro-US Eastern Europe, a Korea reorienting toward the West, the Iran mullahs overthrown, & phenomenal US economic growth?
3621 2018-07-29 23:20:17 Isis is radicalizing the MS13 and the oil industry God's made it all happen. That's a campaign promise that keeps the rest of us terrorized.
3622 2018-07-29 23:20:16 おはようございます
3623 2018-07-29 23:20:08 @LindaDuncanMP  And the solution is what? Hobble our energy sector? Impoverish thousands while we just buy more OPEC oil?
3624 2018-07-29 23:20:08 Beginning to think you get a climactic pleasure out of saying "No collusion". I mean why otherwise continue lying  (whispered aside) When a snake oil salesman begins to believe even his own ills can be healed by said oil...not good...see a real doctor.
3625 2018-07-29 23:19:48 I was told about this one but I have sensitive skin and was advised not to use it because it will burn. I'm going to try their marula oil next.
3626 2018-07-29 23:19:47 No Don, Venezuela has this rankings from at least 10 years ago, sanctions are irrelevant. They sell oil and get paid and can buy whatever. It only forbids new debt, country is already choked in old debts. Government use this as an excuse to make ppl struggle and maintain power
3627 2018-07-29 23:19:46 So apparently popping in two fish oil capsules makes me awake 
3628 2018-07-29 23:19:43 I gave the same answer, but my mother boiled them, & all other vegetables. We steam them, or sauté them in olive oil with seasoning & I love brussel sprouts now. #NostalgiaChat

3633 2018-07-29 23:18:21 My mom has Lupus and suffers from pain all over here body everyday and I keep telling her to use CBD oil bc I’ve done so much research on it and her response is always, “I only follow doctors orders” 
3634 2018-07-29 23:18:02 I'm over trying to figure out how to get vegetable oil out of my diet and these kids are gonna have all types of malignant diseases

3637 2018-07-29 23:17:37 People who prey on the vulnerable, like the young mothers and fathers you are torturing,  especially people in power, will greet their savour in hell. And after they  are boiled in oil their skin will be peeled from their bodies mm by mm. But as a Christian you know ur fate.
3638 2018-07-29 23:17:36 Lmao  we are cooking with oil now 
3639 2018-07-29 23:17:32 Persuasive or not it was all the truth. Just as in Venezuela a kleptocracy is stealing vast sums of oil wealth. Iran should be a very advanced nation with nothing to fear. Instead there is poverty, paranoia and oppression. Sad.
3640 2018-07-29 23:17:04 Maybe the oil is anointing oil
3641 2018-07-29 23:16:58 Iran's currency plunged to another record low on Sunday, dropping past 100,000 rials to the US dollar as Iranians brace for Aug. 7 when the United States is due to reimpose a first lot of sanctions on their economy. Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by EOY.

3643 2018-07-29 23:16:48 Yes, this terrible story was already in play back then. It was about oil and still is. We have GOT TO TAKE DOWN the oil cartel.
3644 2018-07-29 23:16:48 just put eggs and olive oil on my hair and if this doesn’t help my breakage I’m gonna lose it
3645 2018-07-29 23:16:39 Only time before your rich @GOP donors will have an oil derrick in the middle of that lake

3648 2018-07-29 23:16:25 #1 I found out something today. If an oil rig drill on prairie  or farm land the farmer or govt can request that raw  sewage cannot go into the soil and yet it is in the ST, Lawrence and oceans and rivers. The men’s quarters need to have huge bags attached to the toilets .

3651 2018-07-29 23:15:59 So, I must be building a tolerance because I took one of those infused coconut oil capsules like three hours ago and I only felt something slightly.
3652 2018-07-29 23:15:34 So much for Alberta advantage!  Just in Ottawa and got gas for $1.18/L. Got back to Lethbridge and other than Costco it’s about $1.32/L???  Not sure why we are getting gouged here in the land of oil? Don’t profess to understand big oil, but feel we are getting ripped off.
3653 2018-07-29 23:15:30 Yeah they did, if I hadn’t bought the oil beforehand the guy said it would’ve been 35
3654 2018-07-29 23:15:09 i like doing spinach & arugula base, kalamata olives, heirloom tomatoes, some sort of cheese--normally feta but i like cutting up brie if i have it, beets, kidney beans & olive oil/lemon dressing! & also i like a warm element, one time i did rosemary potatoes and that was great

3659 2018-07-29 23:14:52 Oil pulling is meant to pull toxins from your mouth and gums. You get a teaspoon of coconut oil and swish it around in your mouth. They say 20 mins but my jaw gets tired. Then spit it in a napkin and trash it. Don’t spit oil in the sink. I’m new to it tho so def research

3661 2018-07-29 23:14:49 I got my oil changed and I was talking to the guy about my trip to see my grandma. He checked the whole car for free and gave me a discount on my oil change.  Wholesome people change your life.

3674 2018-07-29 23:13:01 The Altona Refinery is a blight on the West of Melbourne. Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.
3675 2018-07-29 23:12:54 My father cited sticking his hand down the side of a Jaguar engine and pulling it back coated with oil for the 100th time as the reason he sold Pruett's Olde English Garage and opened Park Road Saab Service. If he was alive, he'd pay the owner to fire buckshot into every one.

3681 2018-07-29 23:11:54 @WomenatForbes Furthermore, it seems like any imbecile with a facial product can be turned into an overnight "billionaire sensation" while real business(oil, manufacturing, automobile, steel, etc) struggles to get moving.
3682 2018-07-29 23:11:29 Numbers don’t LIE! Obama raised the debt ceiling to $20 trillion - ended manufacturing as we knew it - oil/gas shut down - banking so you couldn’t get a loan - bancruptcy at an all time high- foreclosure all time high- unemployed high - lowest 8yr gdp in history

3687 2018-07-29 23:10:47 Nope, no way, snake oil and war, war, war.
3688 2018-07-29 23:10:46 We agree on needed campaign finance reform, Jeffrey. But Kochs are just mad bc Trump is encroaching on their oil holdings. They own pols at EVERY level of our government. So no,I don’t think he’s down for severe campaign finance reform & Dems would be dumb to make any deal w/him.

3694 2018-07-29 23:09:37 That’s is exactly the problem. He has done nothing for us. Everything has been for the wealthy, corporation Oil & RUssia. You just think your winning.
3695 2018-07-29 23:09:34 It's all you've got left. Religion has a negative connotation so you make the stretch of semantically attaching your snake oil ideas to scientific theories and falsely equivocating. You aren't winning converts.

3697 2018-07-29 23:09:24 You are my link laddie!
I have unfollowed Trump, also blocked him!
Many more need to do this, as I get any information on his ranting tweets from others!
Just read about a policy being put through to take off animals on the endangered species list..many are in areas with oil..
3698 2018-07-29 23:08:49 Oil will save us all! Yay oil! Say no to innovation!
3699 2018-07-29 23:08:32 My dad asked me if I had checked the oil in my car recently and the NEXT DAY the “change oil” light turned on. HOW DO THEY KNOW???
3700 2018-07-29 23:08:27 When I went to Tesla in NZ and asked if there was any government incentive for Kiwis (New Zealanders) to buy electric vehicles, they said no, then my friend said: Yes there is! The oil prices and the tax they are imposing on it! haha :-)
3701 2018-07-29 23:08:27 Why would you not put olive oil and garlic though?
3702 2018-07-29 23:08:15 Song medleys in 80’s bars are like musical Turduckens. Oh, you like Rio? Well we take Rio, stuff it into Girls On Film and cram that up Hungry Like The Wolf’s butt. Then we deep fry the whole thing in cocaine oil.
3703 2018-07-29 23:08:15 Oh I hope you are feeling happier tonight!!  Sorry I was gone all day, or I would have sent these flowers and sunshine sooner!

3705 2018-07-29 23:08:01 Oh shit, have you never oil cleansed before? It's fucking magical for taking off makeup. I bought some sherbert-texture oil cleanser before and was like "wtf, does this actually work?" and then stood there in awe as it removed everything.

3707 2018-07-29 23:07:41 Did some exercise tonight for the first time in years, had a healthy tea and I felt pretty good. 
 3 hours later.... here I am sat eating cheese, bread and oil, crisps and a mini cheesecake. 
Why do I do this?!

3718 2018-07-29 23:05:27 Yo I got my hair cut above my shoulders end of 2016. My hair is now touching my backside lol. Castor oil for hair growth does absolute wonders! Also use castor oil shampoo and conditioners! L’Oréal have a great one

3794 2018-07-29 22:56:46 17 million barrels of oil a year are used to make new plastic, most of it thrown away after just one use. Once discarded, plastic becomes a cost to the public: collecting it, managing it, moving it, disposing of it is an expensive burden

3810 2018-07-29 22:53:32 Yeah, washing every day can cause dry scalp problems. I usually try alternating between conditioning and shampooing although I've been told to condition everyday...I feel that depends on the person and how much sweat/oil they generate.

3819 2018-07-29 22:52:29 Hemp oil can be used to make a synthetic foam that repels water but is a natural oil attractant. Makes sense to use this natural material for oil/petroleum cleanup and its cheap to produce not to mention growing hemp reduces CO2 in the atmosphere.
3820 2018-07-29 22:52:25 I recently swapped out all the video game posters in my home for more reasonable, traditional oil paintings, but some very grumpy and unreasonable detectives from the Louvre just showed up and took them all. They didn't even give me back my thumb tacks.

3830 2018-07-29 22:50:42 Apparently palm oil companies are causing massive deforestation. It is said that vegetable oil is another name for palm oil. Enviros, here is a suggestion. TAX the palm oil and use that money for reforestation.
3831 2018-07-29 22:50:38 all you've to do is turn it upside down and let the oil go down to the bottom then you can stir it with no mess! 
3832 2018-07-29 22:50:29 I started with polish
then used multiple grits (coarse to fine)
then used 3-1 oil and used some of the finer grits again

3838 2018-07-29 22:49:25 4. Mitrokhin Archives talks about it. The last expose on such deals was the Volcker Report. Saddam Hussain gave the Iraqi oil vouchers to Sonia Gandhi who in turn passed it on to the oil traders and had her cut. There was no easier way to make money than this.

3848 2018-07-29 22:47:11 But could benzene have been leaking at ‘trace’ levels all along? I suspect it has been. Perhaps could never lead to a remedy, but certainly causes concern and an explanation for cancer clusters in or near SoCal oil fields

3852 2018-07-29 22:45:44 "One moment please" kneesocks says before going to the back of her bar, finding a half full tank of motor oil she used to use for her car and comes back to the bar with it serving the bot and putting a straw in the oil tank can.
3853 2018-07-29 22:45:39   what goes around come around
3854 2018-07-29 22:45:37 Sure but you know as well as I do that the number itself isn't the issue but rather how many of those pitches were under stress. One could argue, outside of the last two innings, when he could taste the no-no, it was a fairly stress free afternoon for Newcomb.
3855 2018-07-29 22:45:29 They need to hire more people if it takes that long for a simple oil change. You don't follow me so I can't DM you. Out of 10 bays 2 should be dedicated to oil changes IMO
3856 2018-07-29 22:45:09 Today I finished a plumbing repair, patched drywall, changed power washer oil, fixed pool pump, fixed and adjusted driveway gate and sensor, fixed garage door opener, made fresh guacamole, made fresh chicken wings. Seriously considering requesting a raise in my allowance.

3858 2018-07-29 22:44:42 @PressSec coal,oil gas companies what to fully fund oil extraction from coal . a plant will increase reserves 41% constantly. land in Salyersville Kentucky is free and ready to be built on . plant jobs will be 2300 men to run it hundreds of related jobs connected to this
3859 2018-07-29 22:44:36 So Im in Napa. There are wineries with wine tastings, olive groves with olive oil tasting, even a distillery with vodkas tasting....why don't the dairies have milk tastings?
3860 2018-07-29 22:44:33 Finding out a restaurant fries their stuff in avocado oil after the fact is a real doozy #AllergicToAvocado #WasAFun3Hours #Denver
3861 2018-07-29 22:44:29 Of course. I recently bought my third bottle of extra virgin olive oil.
3862 2018-07-29 22:44:28 おはようございます(*^^*)
3863 2018-07-29 22:44:23 and the oil change place for that matter

3865 2018-07-29 22:44:06 At this point that's wishful thinking. Mankind is going to burn all the oil and that'll be that.
3866 2018-07-29 22:44:04 Kinda like using solar powered pumps for a oil pipeline. Better than not I guess. But plane travel a huge source of GHG emissions and growing.
3867 2018-07-29 22:43:56 Block them Scarlett and move on, very brave behind their keyboards, and I bet they’re all oil paintings! #ignorethehaters
3868 2018-07-29 22:43:52 you don't have to grease palms in the oil industry they have all the money they need and a hard working low education person can make 90000+ without asking gov for anything
3869 2018-07-29 22:43:51 No he was "Born again" Christian, Evangelical and he's very much in bed with Bibi as he wants to illegally drill oil from the Golan Heights.  It's history repeating with these fascist types
3870 2018-07-29 22:43:29 Even if the ship were to sink, nada will happen as regards that “waste” shipment.

Poluttion will come from the ship’s oil. Not it’s cargo.
3871 2018-07-29 22:43:27 Yep. Something like oil (and other commodities) will always have a value as it’s used in the production process to create value. $BTC doesn’t assist value creation in the same way (yet).
3872 2018-07-29 22:43:25 Palm oil causes Cancer too.

3878 2018-07-29 22:42:59 I do the same except I coat with olive oil then grill.
3879 2018-07-29 22:42:36 I wanna oil paint but of course that’s the most time consuming, messy, and space taking paint for me to pick
3880 2018-07-29 22:42:27 @FoxNews keeps putting him on. Anyone over there do any background on this guy?
3881 2018-07-29 22:42:18 Every other week at dinner time, my three-year-old asks me to describe how argan oil is made. It cracks him up. (I'm also a good mime)
3882 2018-07-29 22:41:59 A little caster oil will take care of that.
3883 2018-07-29 22:41:48 bread, soaps, shampoos, chocolate, ice cream, chips, paint etc. there is 100+ names for palm oil. the 2 main ones i know of is   Glycerin and vegetable oil
3884 2018-07-29 22:41:42 Products that have the words vegetable oil in the ingredients I do not buy. If the manufacturers can not say the type of oil I consider the products as having palm oil. Palm oil is  bad for health, using palm oil by manufacturers shows disregard for customers and the environment.
3885 2018-07-29 22:41:41 Divergence t opposite of oil. Same neg div in copper since nov 2016 where t metall now payed off some. As it’s supposed to as leading industriell indicator. All we need now is gold to show us t way home -  if though a EW2 first, it’ll be interesting if on sentiment or panikk.

3888 2018-07-29 22:41:30 @Kasandrinos any idea on when your 3L olive oil will be back in stock? I’m out and need a refill
3889 2018-07-29 22:41:30 blame Republicans for Medicare being underfunded. Democrats would raise the funding, but Republicans don't want to raise taxes on the rich, end tax loopholes, end oil & corporate subsidies, or avoid wars of choice like Iraq.
3890 2018-07-29 22:41:29 Thanks.

3897 2018-07-29 22:39:25 Dinner: baked salmon with harissa, roasted green beans with citrus pepper, courgettes sauteed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and wild mushroom and tarragon risotto. Even my ridiculously-difficult-to-please father said it was a good meal.
3898 2018-07-29 22:39:21 From what i kmow he used to be a dictator. So ill go with the last respomse in your question
3899 2018-07-29 22:39:19 we don't need to ask China for money, We can raise taxes on the rich, eliminate tax loopholes, institute a property wealth tax of 1% a year for assets over 2M dollars (just like municipalities have property taxes), end oil & corporate subsidies, & avoid wars of choice like Iraq.
3900 2018-07-29 22:39:11 Lol. As long as it works. I once had to replace oil with applesauce, had no apple sauce, and used banana instead... it was a rough time too
3901 2018-07-29 22:39:03 Guys coconut oil is your best friend. Promise

3903 2018-07-29 22:38:44 No effect whatsoever? So what does? How is it that Norway saved 1 trillion US dollars, KSA, and the other Gulf states also? Are you saying oil is a guaranteed curse on a country, no matter how functional it might have been prior to discovery?
3904 2018-07-29 22:38:33 so while fixing my stuff for work i just found out i left my cheek tint, lip balm, and oil sheets sa batangas ahhhhhhhhh nooooo 
3905 2018-07-29 22:38:25 Man every time i go get my oil changed im reminded of how much i DON'T know about cars

3914 2018-07-29 22:37:30 If he's accustomed to 100-110 and suddenly throws 130, there are ancillary issues apart from the extra workload that can cause injury. Stressing the arm when the rest of the body is tired, etc.

3915 2018-07-29 22:37:26 "Anything you want, but uhh...can you even drink this stuff? If you want i can get some motor oil i keep in the back or something"
3916 2018-07-29 22:37:07 Its not as impressive as Dabo being praised for his faith & then less than a week later glossing over his star player giving a lap dance.. That is a  slick-talking oil salesman with no bounds.. IMPRESSIVE!
3917 2018-07-29 22:36:59 Bitumin can be shipped in a solid form by rail. No need to bring in foreign oil to dilute it.
3918 2018-07-29 22:36:52 Well this morning my mom fucked up a leg muscle running and tonight my dad spilled hot oil on himself cooking.  Not a great day for the fam.
3919 2018-07-29 22:36:41 2/ That market is also governed by humans. I assume the market psychology remains same everywhere. 

What is there in Bitcoin that people are willing to buy it for 10k or 20k but they aren't that much interested in an established commodity such as oil etc. ?
3920 2018-07-29 22:36:38 Charlatan. Snake Oil Salesman. Evilgenital. Riding on Daddy's coattails. How much does he disclose, financially, to his followers?About the same disclosure as America has gotten from Trumpsky?
3921 2018-07-29 22:36:07 I need my oil changed so bad but i have all the stuff just don’t know how to do it 
3922 2018-07-29 22:36:00 I'm jealous  I've the extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, black pepper....and a clove or two of garlic just twiddling their thumbs... waiting for the right tomatoes to come along  I hope yours taste as scrumptious as they look
3923 2018-07-29 22:35:30 1/ With all due respect mate,  i am sure everyone here understands that other commodities such as oil are far better established and have better earnings report. But give it a thought why no one is willing to pay 50k or just 10k for Oil? Greater fools Theory applies there too.
3924 2018-07-29 22:35:17 I’m thinking of the oil and gas wells that have been operated constantly in the LA area for decades. Was anyone measuring benzene? How many of us who lived near these oil fields have been exposed? Numerous cases of cancer in Simi Valley have been blamed on Rocketdyne radiation.
3925 2018-07-29 22:35:10 Got to spend my first nearly hour in an olive oil company trying different olive oils. It was amazing and made me really experience the true Italian feeling. Definitely just ate an entire clove of garlic as a result... I may have a problem but I'll have amazing heart health
3926 2018-07-29 22:34:58 As an importer of your beautiful Miron Glass bottles (and only company to bottle NZ olive oil in Miron bottles), I regret not having the opportunity to meet, nor to present our products to you. Safe travels.
3927 2018-07-29 22:34:53 You are also overlooking that oil is shipped to Canada to dilute the bitumin so it will flow in the pipes. Also methane leaks from the pipes are an issue.
3928 2018-07-29 22:34:37 どうでしょう新作の知らせは嬉しいんだけど...あれ？今年放送予定だった新作は？
3929 2018-07-29 22:34:24 Jarret stood in the rain to put oil in my car y’all in so thankful for this man
3930 2018-07-29 22:34:20 A cool thing about reading recipes that require a shitload of oil for frying is they don't tell you what to do with the oil after. Congrats on your two gallons of leftover Thanksgiving turkey peanut oil. Good luck getting rid of it, you stupid idiot dumbass moron
3931 2018-07-29 22:34:18 sad that Labour is turning away from down-to-earth ideas like, er, sending noisy neighbours to live on abandoned oil rigs

3933 2018-07-29 22:34:00 Nice legacy of PC govts of past. They sure do care about the middle and low income earners. NOT! But how many greased palms were there in oil industry and rural ridings? Me thinks there were many many many. That’s why Cons want back in and will partner with thieves to do it.
3934 2018-07-29 22:33:55 i ordered biotin pills and oil and i already use castor oil im so done with my eyebrows they're the ugliest part of me
3935 2018-07-29 22:33:52 None of the things you mentioned involve oil being used as fuel... aka the fossil FUEL industry. Try again
3936 2018-07-29 22:33:43 May your head never lack oil in Jesus Name, Amen.
3937 2018-07-29 22:33:36 I bought a new foundation and it literally looks like I’ve rubbed oil all over my face. 
3938 2018-07-29 22:33:26 The hardest part of Drum Corps is being ripped away from your friends in the lot the instant the show is over. We propose the Sunday after Finals Day be renamed “Friends Day” and we’ll all just hang out at Lucas Oil and remember the good times from the season as we say goodbye
3939 2018-07-29 22:33:24 @SteveHiltonx  on a recent show you reviewed violations by Wilbur Ross . You suggested he has failed to divest oil, steel and related holdings in contrast to US interets. He denies all. Where does this go? Is there any investigation? Shouting "fire" seems meaningless. Follow up!
3940 2018-07-29 22:33:12 It could be a two-fer for Putin: 1) inspiring such breathless headlines to appear to be "divesting" US paper, & 2) generating operating cash for a domestic economy whose problems are systemic & a budget that needs $100/bbl oil to fund.
3941 2018-07-29 22:33:07 sometimes i imagine taking the boards off, giving them a brushing off and a light sanding ...... and maybe some linseed oil

3943 2018-07-29 22:33:00 peak oil was just another scam to get everyone to accept agenda21
3944 2018-07-29 22:32:59 Hope the climate change deniers (oil industry; many evangelicals; many Republicans) are sick to their stomachs with the havoc and suffering their foolishness and greed has unleashed on the world.
3945 2018-07-29 22:32:52 Just shrimp and Old Bay seasoning in a skillet, my friend. Tiny bit of olive oil.

3953 2018-07-29 22:31:37 @WSJ Promote the big, resurgent industries(manufacturing, auto, steel, oil, natural gas) online. If internet and television did that the way they do hair products and the Kardishians, we would never have gone into decline in manufacturing and oil exports.
3954 2018-07-29 22:31:23 No oil can come out of the olive until it gets crushed. 
No anointing can come out of us until we are crushed.

3955 2018-07-29 22:31:13 Bee keeper told me he put sardine oil on the electric fence. Bear investigated, touches with tongue or nose... avoids it like the plague afterwards.  Sounds cruel, but it doesn't hurt the bear and no bears get killed as a result.

3959 2018-07-29 22:30:34 I'd argue the ridiculous part is the notion guys can't go much past 100 these days. Newcomb looked as in control in the 9th as he did in any other inning. If an arm is going to give out, it'll happen b/c of overall wear & tear, not due to tossing an extra 30 pitches now & again.

3969 2018-07-29 22:29:22 You genuinely believe that a country of only 5 million which is oil rich to the tune of half a trillion would need to be subsidised? That just sounds silly. 

Yet Norway, a country of similar size, location, etc which also enjoys North Sea oil is one of the richest in Europe?

3973 2018-07-29 22:27:44 DANGER of Iranian miscalculation in the Straits of Hormuz. Vital to global oil supply. Easily interdicted by Revolutionary Guard attack boats and mines. Powerful US Navy and USAF will absolutely break the Iranian blockade in 60 day bloody battle.
3974 2018-07-29 22:27:12 Yeah! That's why we voted GEJ in 2011 in order to continue the project.

We don't want money, rice, salt or ground oil. We want projects to be executed so that every citizen will benefit from it.
3975 2018-07-29 22:27:06 Thank you... I was about to say the same thing before I saw your reply... Katsina is also closer to Niger.. Also Dangote is already building a new refinery in the south, sure it's privately owned but it's in the south..
3976 2018-07-29 22:26:58 @realDonaldTrump New, professional accounts through twitter should be created to promote rise of big industries( manufacturing, auto, steel, oil drilling, oil exporting, natural gas etc.). WSJ does not have the reach and circulation(good as it is).

Many countries keep tight control of certain sectors (oil, airlines, trains etc)

3984 2018-07-29 22:25:26 Also put a menthol scent in your waxer or use eucalyptus oil in a diffuser. Hope some of this helps. Love you get better soon 
3985 2018-07-29 22:25:20 2/ Saying "Bitcoin's value is equal to the amount next person is willing to pay" is outright wrong and illogical. Why are "those" people not willing to pay 200k for Gold or Oil? Think.

There is some value in Bitcoin which other things such as Gold, Oil, stocks etc. lack.

4002 2018-07-29 22:22:14 There is a lot of oil in some of you lot’s backs and what you need to do is release it.

4008 2018-07-29 22:20:49 Would be if it were true,West Virginia has more Child Marriages than Sweden. The Christian children being raped in West Virginia are being abused with the blessing of the churches and state. In Sweden couples have to be 18 or over.
4009 2018-07-29 22:20:13 This!! I use a facial oil blend for my face and oil as opposed to lotion. It’s light and even when I get sweaty and behind at work everyone is still like “you smell so good!”
4010 2018-07-29 22:20:04 I got robbed while I was sleeping on the bus from NY.

 YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING UNDER YOURS. OOOOOPS IM SORRY, YOU DON’T EVEN HAVE A DAMN CAR 
4015 2018-07-29 22:18:57 Take an edible or some cbd oil even for the nausea maybe? Weed can help the nausea but wouldn’t want you to smoke or vape after that surgery for sure so those delivery methods might be best.
4016 2018-07-29 22:18:54 I got mine from the neighborhood farmers market. Having them with fresh mozzarella, drizzled w good olive oil & a little fresh basil. Simple food is the best food.
4017 2018-07-29 22:18:44 Looking great! 
I also owned a Beatle back in the early 90s. The guy who owned it actually cried when I drove away with it. He would often call to check on it and even called our mutual  mechanic to check if I have had oil changed on time. 
4018 2018-07-29 22:18:32 Still not properly on the road & also haven't managed to actually see my grandfather yet which is other than ideal timing-wise for him. But all of my other necessary tasks are done (except an oil change which I may just have to do tomorrow somewhere random on the way). So yay.
4019 2018-07-29 22:18:31 I mean we're surrounded by gulf and we are the only ones with no oil ? Haaa?

4021 2018-07-29 22:18:16 Hell if you think of Azerite as an analogue of oil it actually makes sense, we actively fight each other both in war and diplomacy over it as a resource despite the fact the consumption and over reliance on it is causing a huge problem for our planets health.

4023 2018-07-29 22:18:14 McLaren were very vocal criticizing honda, but honda always said that mclaren wasn't doing a good job with the chassis. They said that the design left things open oil leaks (which is what kept happening).

4027 2018-07-29 22:17:12 This is equivalent to retweeting a post about George W Bush spending his free time oil painting and then blaming him for the blue wave coming this fall.

4029 2018-07-29 22:16:44 Look at the ingredients of packaged food in the grocery stores. Some combination of garbage, seed oil and cheap sugar. Keeps the world sick and big food profitable. Eat food with one ingredient, add salt, be healthy. #carnivore #LCHF

4035 2018-07-29 22:16:15 Man, watching videos of children with severe seizures trying CBD oil for the first time is so amazing, jeez. They can be violently shaking and then within seconds they are ok and safe. I think it’s cool that it’s been helping so many health problems. I know that’s an unpopular
4036 2018-07-29 22:16:12 For a balanced look, one should also include the Companies that don’t have refining capabilities. Suncor and Imperial Oil aren’t necessarily a proper indication. Cherry Picking at its finest

4039 2018-07-29 22:15:32 They want to pipe oil to Katsina for refining. They want to get everything before they will now say let's go our separate ways. Which ever way, they are disadvantaged.

4054 2018-07-29 22:13:12 I want a choice on how my money is invested. Oil and gas has externalized costs. I have insurance costs going up after a wind storm damaged my roof. I have asthma. My husband on heart meds. I don't need investment in smog that could kill us.
4055 2018-07-29 22:13:05 C-P-C has raised gasoline and diesel prices at the pump from this morning following a hike in international crude oil prices last week,.
4056 2018-07-29 22:12:41 @mleonardgy Michael, do you think the oil deal with Exxon Mobil has the potential to transform Guyana and its economy and people? What challenges do you think officials and the government face in ensuring that Guyana gets its fair share?
4057 2018-07-29 22:12:38 The effects of oil on a country has nothing to do with population. Check out KSA(2nd largest oil producer) how many are they, what of Venezuela, what’s happening there now. Oil means free money therefore dependency/laziness for citizens
4058 2018-07-29 22:12:27 Luke, you’re buying your oil from a Talking-Snake Oil salesman - what else would the peddler Of fairy stories and Director of Studies in Theology say?

1) Shampoo hair and rinse.
2) section it into 4 or 6 parts so the conditioner really gets in there.
3) condition each section  and tie it.
4) scrub body and them knees ooo 
5) wash out conditioner each section by section.
6) apply leave in conditioner and oil.
4060 2018-07-29 22:12:15 While .@realdonaldtrump has us distracted with his many atrocities, he may be planning to bomb IRAN to distract us. And take the oil in IRAN, he is trying to discredit #Mueller at the same time. #STAYWOKE
4061 2018-07-29 22:11:59 Ok James. Assuming Norway & Scotland  (Uk) have a similar oil production  (UK slightly higher but lets gloss over that) how come Norway have roughly a NOK22bn surplus & the UK has £1.9b deficit. 
Its almost like all that all that tax revenue has been pissed up against a wall.
4062 2018-07-29 22:11:54 I have the last 4 crossed off with a low prob of oil px spike. I must be bullish!! CB's a risk but Fed the only one in full motion.

4073 2018-07-29 22:10:00 Different question for you if the stop leak stuff has no negative consequences why isn’t it in the oil to begin with... it’s a bandaid.
4074 2018-07-29 22:09:44 Isn't all that made in the US? Why would we be importing food, Coke or even gas at this point? We shouldn't be exporting oil if we need it here. Maybe we shouldn't be paying government food subsidies to farmers either.
4075 2018-07-29 22:09:43 Not one bit of sense!  If I spend money taking care of my hair then I don’t love myself.I see women spending way more buying fake asses and lips...sooooo what does that mean? That costs way more than my coconut oil and afrobutter. 
4076 2018-07-29 22:09:42 Well, we're talking about AB. The ABPCs were fiscally irresponsible. They frittered away AB's resource wealth by propping up spending even in good years by using income from the Heritage Trust Fund. Spending in fiscal 2013-4 (before the oil price downturn) increased by 19.6%.

4081 2018-07-29 22:08:53 mais jme doutais que tu parlais pas vraiment d'huile genre l'huile d'olive c pour ça jtai dit que oil = pétrole
4082 2018-07-29 22:08:49 If you really need an answer it’s yes.  Obama was trying to do exactly what George Soros told him.  Bush Jr was trying to remember who he was. Clinton was trying to rape someone. Bush Sr was trying to make a buck in oil.
4083 2018-07-29 22:08:42 that’s runner up  1973 was, among other things, Watergate hearings, end of US involvement in Vietnam, precursor to the European Union, first OPEC oil embargo, inflation, and Roe vs. Wade.

4118 2018-07-29 22:02:26 all good though, cause I'm home and have my oil handy now :)
4119 2018-07-29 22:02:15 me too,  I use lemon water mixed with olive oil
4120 2018-07-29 22:02:14 Well I am actually going to ‘tool up’ right now.  There’s a car that needs an oil change so kiss my ass
4121 2018-07-29 22:02:12 TEA TREE OIL IS THE BEST ALONG WITH THE OTHERS 
4122 2018-07-29 22:01:51 However once solar is in place it is never used up.. this why it's renewable.. where as oil is always used up every day and is finite!  If we used solar more the tech of solar would improve!
4123 2018-07-29 22:01:47 list of the Natural resources in Nigeria and where they can be found.
MINERAL RESOURCES

Crude oil and Gas
Imo, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Edo, Bayelsa, Rivers, Abia
4124 2018-07-29 22:01:41 some of the treasury's deposits & debt are backed by gold but I'd say more by the stability from revenue of USD being the petrodollar. US simply invades if another country goes off the USD for oil, see Iraq & Libya

Hence the massive global US military presence esp NAVY & AF
4125 2018-07-29 22:01:35 They posted huge profits but alas, the service companies are still hurting...Oil Co. demanded huge cuts to them...up to 30% ....it’s not on the upswing
4126 2018-07-29 22:01:32 and considering Big Data is pretty much the new oil, add Nigeria’s hilariously weak or non existent privacy/ data protection laws, Google just hit the jackpot. You‘re clever so you know it’s true.

4134 2018-07-29 22:00:13 who is probably an organizer with some social/eco justice group that gets funding from an oil baron or whatever
4135 2018-07-29 22:00:07 Next up - that oil drum?
4136 2018-07-29 22:00:01 Same lol use caster oil on em every night before bed. Helps them grow!
4137 2018-07-29 21:59:57 Cookies don't burn and smoke like donuts do when dropped into hot oil
4138 2018-07-29 21:59:52 Okay kinda weird but I got this migraine essential oil roller thing on amazon that had great reviews for headache relief and holy shit it’s actually soo good! Def recommend trying
4139 2018-07-29 21:59:46 tea tree oil/ Saline is a life saver
4140 2018-07-29 21:59:16 So my sister called and said she was gettin a oil change and needed me to come change her brake lights... why tf she aint have the oil niggas do it 
4141 2018-07-29 21:58:59 is it like a moisturizer? serum? oil?
4142 2018-07-29 21:57:43 Strappin' in for futures - overnight session OIL $WTI #CL, Crypto $BTC #Bitcoin, Gold $GC_F. Should be inflection week. GL!
4143 2018-07-29 21:57:32 - difference btw body butter and lotion. Ingredient wise lotions are usually mineral based it clogs up pores and the way it’s sourced is bad for the environment
-anything with mineral oil , petroleum and paraffin you should stay away from
4144 2018-07-29 21:57:02 Aaren literally just made me lunch then went outside in the heat to give my car an oil change. 
I seriously do not deserve him holy crap
4145 2018-07-29 21:56:54 A light sauté in butter and olive  oil. Deglaze with dry white, then hot it with heavy cream.  Motherfucker!
4146 2018-07-29 21:56:50 Internal 1 x haft then 2 x gloss  but exterior is 2+2 but don't let that put u off. Recently did 2 exteriors 1 caparol 1 in crown oil in same week. Wb far better finish no dust particles in it following morning quick drying, no painful wrists & bad head
4147 2018-07-29 21:56:49 What he meant was those who divert contract money,steal crude oil and arms money.

4149 2018-07-29 21:56:45 Yeah babe, it’s an oil you apply to the ends of your hair after you’ve showered and it makes them super soft and luscious! Ah that’s a shame! I heartily recommend this brand though 
4150 2018-07-29 21:56:44 BVN pepper dem, TSA injure dem, sales of stolen Assets shocked dem,  Revocation of Oil licenses go kill dem. Economic Parasites!
4151 2018-07-29 21:56:42 I mix washing up liquid for dishes and olive oil mixed together. The washing liquid cleans it really well and the olive oil makes sure it doesnt dry up too much. Works super well 
4152 2018-07-29 21:56:40 Eco styler gel, the blac castor oil & coconut one to get it up in a bun and when I did the twist out I used shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie .. I also mix the ogx coconut oil anti breakage serum into my styling products
4153 2018-07-29 21:56:36 He hasn't done anything worthwhile except spend our tax dollars on golf trips & give us another 1.5 trillion in debt 2 help the 1%. I would guess U R an oil magnate & nothing he's doing will hurt U. What about veterans, what about seniors, what about ppl trying 2 survive on MW?
4154 2018-07-29 21:56:13 Don't forget about Popeye and Brutus love affair with olive oil
4155 2018-07-29 21:56:07 The White Helmets are not ISIS fire brigade. You are relying on  poor hostage, whose fate is still unknown, who must have been forced to make this ISIS propaganda video. BTW, ISIS terrorists supplied Assad with oil & they always enjoyed free & safe passage through regime's lines.
4156 2018-07-29 21:55:50 It's cat oil
4157 2018-07-29 21:54:30 Honestly, even if Malfurion did get a big hero moment, EVERYTHING he has done since waking up is covered by this oil of sexist behavior. Shoving Tyrande aside, “hush Tyrande,” not pronouncing her name properly… he shows tremendous disrespect of the woman he supposedly loves.
4158 2018-07-29 21:54:27 Honestly,,,, stay away from anyone that tells u to put citrus, baking soda or coconut oil on ur face........
4159 2018-07-29 21:54:25 Caroline Flack is short for Caroline Flaxseed oil. #LoveIsland⁠ ⁠
4160 2018-07-29 21:54:06 Conspiracy theories, nuclear winter, and snake oil! Love you guys 
4161 2018-07-29 21:53:58 The best CBD Oil I have ever tried!! I am finally sleeping all night!
It’s coming soon!

Post interested and I'll send you info
4162 2018-07-29 21:53:53 Agreed. Myb
4163 2018-07-29 21:53:43 Finally getting a protein and hot oil treatment 
4164 2018-07-29 21:53:39 Turn 1 is just full of speedy dry from the oil from earlier on the low side and Bubba's wreck up high. Gonna be interesting #NASCAR #GanderOutdoors400
4165 2018-07-29 21:53:38 Wooooord!!!!!
4166 2018-07-29 21:53:32 This a great reliable car with some minor cosmetic damage. It has had consistent maintenance. Recently changed oil, spark plugs and coolant. Sunroof, tan leather interior. Runs like a champ. Free and clear title.
4167 2018-07-29 21:53:17 Pls do. I’ll help you find RSPO replacements for things you like that contain unsustainable palm oil!!!
4168 2018-07-29 21:53:14 Conservative governments and their Oil and Gas tunnel vision is a massive contributor to the recurring boom and bust economy.  A stable economy will be due to the branching out into non-traditional (to Alberta) industries.
4169 2018-07-29 21:53:06 Finally. Finished. Oil!
4170 2018-07-29 21:53:00 Bush/Cheney kept 2 wars 'off the books,' claiming that Iraqi oil would pay for them. That didn't work out. Obama put the wars into the budget, and that added $Trillions in one stroke.
4171 2018-07-29 21:52:58 if you seek assistance from IMF then forget about developement projects; agriculture subsidies—high oil and utility prices will get the people against within no time! IMF is like hanging swords  continue inflicting pain
4172 2018-07-29 21:52:47 Each time @zionoil made announcement that seek to ask more money without providing evidence of oil find rather than claims, the ZN price plummet.  I do not think ZN management would be foolish enough to do that now.  The funds raised in past shld b enough to cover tis p test cost
4173 2018-07-29 21:52:42 Which should consist of oil and electrodes.  Lol
4174 2018-07-29 21:52:37 Lentils are a good source of iron.  Boil them till soft and add olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, and chopped flat, leaf parsley - C. Roden
4175 2018-07-29 21:52:34 Maybe. He was trying to be politically correct nah
4176 2018-07-29 21:52:31 Argan Oil Of Morocco I think.
4177 2018-07-29 21:52:29 He'll be a big part of the team bouncing back. We need him.
4178 2018-07-29 21:52:27 The good: less noise from the valves. 
The bad: I can hear more noise coming from the fan area on my bike. 
Pulling the radiator tomorrow to see what the fan looks like and where the oil is seeping from.
4179 2018-07-29 21:52:14 Sunday

Grass: cut
Next week's project building materials: acquired
Broken/missing tools and chargers: ordered 
Used motor oil: disposed of
Dry cleaning: dropped off

Still only 6pm
4180 2018-07-29 21:52:09 You know the #heatwave is over when you finally see your coconut oil in solid form rather than liquid 
4181 2018-07-29 21:52:00 Oil reserves only matter in the long term. What matters is how much can be produced. American oil production can run fast enough to keep oil prices down by itself. We would need cooperation from Saudi Arabia. And still, we'd have to flood the market from our SPR. A dumb idea.
4182 2018-07-29 21:52:00 6) I live in UT & despite tourism bringing in significantly more revenue, our Representatives are hell bent on selling off these lands for gas & oil extraction & mining. 

Defend Our Parks has no hidden agenda & there is nothing nefarious going on.  We just love our wild places.
4183 2018-07-29 21:51:56 Yours is no doubt a litre of olive oil
4184 2018-07-29 21:51:29 I think the cost includes all that oil

4185 2018-07-29 21:51:21 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
4186 2018-07-29 21:51:20 you was getn an oil change yesterday?
4187 2018-07-29 21:51:16 (3) Worst of all, the oil industry has been destroyed by Chavez' anger after a strike firing 18K workers of the 40K who produced 3.5 mill b/d. Today after outrageous corruption, it has 110K workers, produces about 1 mill b/d, ruined its refining capacity and cannot pay its debts
4188 2018-07-29 21:50:41 @fssaiindia please disclose the report about real milk and milk production by milk powder vegetable oil and chemical mixing. Because a study of a management school shows that milk production/processing company purchasing 50% real milk and 50% man made milk.
4189 2018-07-29 21:50:41 Just watched a baby tear open a gogurt in .4 seconds which reminded me my cbd oil refill is in my mailbox.
4190 2018-07-29 21:50:40 Thanks Riirii, do you think Guyana is able to handle its own oil resources? Why or why not?
4191 2018-07-29 21:50:40 another use for la croix: oil diffuser/confusing air freshener. just open a can, never drink it, and leave it there. in a few days, the entire room will smell like apple juice? some sort of berry candle? what is that? oh it’s that goddamn la croix i never drink every fucking ti
4192 2018-07-29 21:50:30 Because when you decide on regime changes in these countries to replace them with puppets who bow to your demands you not only create chaotic situations to citizens but democratic changes fail like in Iraq.  The Mobil Equatorial Guinea Money from oil end in Washington DC. Tellus
4193 2018-07-29 21:50:19 and I wonder how much we have had to pay for the hair oil????
4194 2018-07-29 21:50:07 About time someone exposed that paid oil shill.
4195 2018-07-29 21:49:50 Oil made Nigeria a better nation, but it could have been best if it was properly managed. If you disagree go stay in Mali.
4196 2018-07-29 21:49:47 A head primarily filled with a mixture of water and olive oil
4197 2018-07-29 21:49:42 My power differential has an oil leak.
4198 2018-07-29 21:49:41 Trump is an idiot, If I took his brains & shoved it up an ants ass , it would look like a BB in a Boxccar. He had better hope Iran doesn't start it's centrifuges again, because China&Russia will not support his embargo.on their oil. What a tool.
4199 2018-07-29 21:49:17 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
4200 2018-07-29 21:49:02 Hang on a minute. No, it's gone and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
4201 2018-07-29 21:48:58 NOOOO omg imagine doing that shitty ass DofE Gold stuff at the same time bts are around jsjfjdg I'm acc too unfit for that but OOF have fun sis imma put some tea tree oil tonight and pray for the best 
4202 2018-07-29 21:48:56 Hearing @JackieSchimmel refer to a fish oil burp as "Nemo in your trachea" was the highlight of my day #wellnessguru #goopy
4203 2018-07-29 21:48:49 Why would it be a loss for Scotland to become politically Independent from the RUK ? Do you believe that all trade with the RUK will stop out of spite ? Do you know how much the RUK relies on trade with Scotland not to mention our resources ? Water, Electricity, Oil & Gas etc ?
4204 2018-07-29 21:48:43 Adding rosehip oil to my night cream and taking vitamin e supplements.

I still turn 29 at midnight.
4205 2018-07-29 21:48:41 No one fought against the Constitution. The guns ossue was restricted to a weapon, nit guns in general. It is not against Constitution to argue that. No one fought freedoms. Unborn is not a fact of nature, we differ in definition there. Coal & oil have market issues. Heath fixed
4206 2018-07-29 21:48:41 Tea tree oil is a life hack
4207 2018-07-29 21:47:51 @itsRichDavid Rich, do you have any questions about Exxon Mobil's oil deal with Guyana and whether it will benefit the people of Guyana and its economy? Would like if you may tweet any questions or comments to @AJStream ahead of our show tomorrow!
4208 2018-07-29 21:47:32 Many of those wallets are exchange wallets, Ed..... it’s more distributed than you think.  There are a few mega holders out there, just like there were people who acquired massive amounts of gold, silver, and oil and became mega rich.
4209 2018-07-29 21:47:28 The Government of Jonathan was borrowing monthly to pay salaries despite over $420Billion reportedly made by the administration from the sale of Crude Oil.
4210 2018-07-29 21:47:25 @realDonaldTrump 
Snake Oil Demagogue

Judging by Trump’s tweets this afternoon, it is now readily evident that Robert Mueller has succeeded in firmly planting himself inside Trump’s ample asshole. 

Godspeed, Mr. Mueller. 

F*ck off, Mr. Trump.
4211 2018-07-29 21:46:45 Thanks for the reply. As a dairy farmer and veterinarian, I find your ad for Coffee-mate to be misleading to consumers. Using the word”churned” for a product made from saturated oil implies dairy content. Agitate or stirred would have been a better description #dairyisgoodforyou
4212 2018-07-29 21:46:43 Lol, oil killed every mineral resource in Nigeria
4213 2018-07-29 21:46:32 I bought a new car because I really didn't want to deal with getting an oil change.
4214 2018-07-29 21:46:17 Right!? I can't believe how much i loved the show as a kid. Like, good lord, I can probably attribute 60% of the problematic internalized notions I've had to unlearn to this show. Though that oil spill episode I think had a positive impact (but Captain Planet might've done more).
4215 2018-07-29 21:46:01 This will fade over time as nuclear takes over for electric generation. Oil interests are our interests in lower fuel prices.
4216 2018-07-29 21:45:53 When my husband was laid off it was due to the oil and gas downturn, and no one wanted him to go. So there was no animosity. But still, there's frustration when it gets down to paying bills and putting food on the table.
4217 2018-07-29 21:45:45 I’ve got coconut oil on my face so they keep sliding off
4218 2018-07-29 21:45:44 
4219 2018-07-29 21:45:43 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
4220 2018-07-29 21:45:35 akala ko may bente sa sahig. oil blotting paper lang pala
4221 2018-07-29 21:45:27 First of all... Just TRY saying anything against the Liberal Agenda at your place of work.  Just try it sometime.  All these companies are being held hostage by all this PC garbage. "I think we should drill for oil wherever we can" ... just try saying something like that at work.
4222 2018-07-29 21:45:24 DEMOCRATS OUT SPENT ,AND TRIED EVERY TRICK IN THEIR BOOKS AND STILL LOST TO A BUSINESS MAN THAT TELLS IT STRAIGHT ,NOT,LIKE THE SNAKE OIL SALESWOMAN KNOWN AS HRC. SHE LOST AND 1.7 YEARS LATER SHE'S STILL BLAMING EVERY ONE AND THING BUT HER SELF..A LOSER!
4223 2018-07-29 21:45:21 Okay but they’re reserves. I’m no economist. But I thought oil prices were out of our POTUS’s hands (other than war/embargo type actions that move the price). Enlighten me friends!!! 
4224 2018-07-29 21:45:16 the smell of motor oil gets him off
4225 2018-07-29 21:45:09 Ya ive been saying this for years and dreaming about it. Its time for this
4226 2018-07-29 21:45:03 I cut the yellow yard onion into thick slices and put salt and rosemary on it and then drizzled it with olive oil before grilling it. The onion was sweet and delicious. Since i threw random onion seeds and store onion butts in that bed, i have no idea what kind of onion that was.
4227 2018-07-29 21:45:02 Trump is an oil rig in the gulf pumping toxins and killing all in its wake. We must be prepared to cap the pipeline and realize we will never be the same. The damage is done, but we must work on plugging the hole for good.
4228 2018-07-29 21:44:40 tissue oil .
4229 2018-07-29 21:44:15 Agreed.  
But we know how Ferrari International Assistance work.
Same as the 'red herring' of oil burning, the oil dumping through turbo, and now a miraculous power increase, available to customers, but only works on previous series works engines?
4230 2018-07-29 21:44:07 I'll be like my Country #Angola and Delta State #Nigeria only the foreign oil companies will reap the rewards of this country's Natural resources #Total #ExxonMobil #Shell #BP r.i.p #Guyanese
4231 2018-07-29 21:43:59 Did He smile when we destroyed a Russian assault brigade? When he opened domestic oil & NG drilling & undermined Putin’s pipeline with Germany? When he destroyed 25% of Assad’s Russia-provided airforce? When he gave deadly aid 2 Ukraine instead of BOOTS like Chicago Jesus? 
4232 2018-07-29 21:43:58 ملف قطر كبير واسود وراجع نفسك عن المؤتمرات والندوات والاكاديميات والجمعيات التي عقدت في قطر منذ عام ٩٥ وستعرف ان قطر كنت غرفه عمليات مشروع الفوضى الخلاقه الذي تبناه (الديمقراطيين ) وانها دعمت بالمليارات هذه الغرفه وعملياتها في المنطقه التى انتجت مانشاهده منذ ٢٠١١
4233 2018-07-29 21:43:41 @TomKitchin @ChefTomKerridge @michelrouxjr @JohnTorode1 do any of you have a healthy recipe for the trout fillets currently in my freezer? Has to be @SlimmingWorld friendly! i.e no butter,oil or wine!!
4234 2018-07-29 21:43:20 will you ever make more of the money oil?
4235 2018-07-29 21:43:15 Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Atta Boy Dog Food Bonus Bag, Nestle Toll House Semi-sweet Morsels, Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna
4236 2018-07-29 21:43:11 i’ve never tried charcoal or coconut oil but i used to do bleaching trays and they work but my enamel was shotttttttt after. also i bought crest strips and i did like one treatment and they work but i was spooked and stopped bc it made my white spots show but they went away
4237 2018-07-29 21:42:59 Gotcha. This pattern, the CNY pattern, the DXY patter, the Euro pattern, AUD pattern, CRB pattern and oil pattern are all consistent. The SXEP pattern is consistent with oil and the same, as is $XOM. Very rare to see monthly patterns all lining up
4238 2018-07-29 21:42:51 I wonder if guys with beards ever get residual pussy smell in their beard?

Imagine a commercial on Saturday Night Live. "Do you ever get the smell of pussy in your beard and would like to remove it before you go back to work? Try gilettes new beard pussy removing oil" 
4239 2018-07-29 21:42:34 Still not sure what u r talking about. Not trying 2 profit. Taxpayers r the consumers of oil products & should pay. Oil companies rn’t absolved from anything. They put up & risk their capital 2  bring oil 2 us & exist 2  make $
4240 2018-07-29 21:42:34 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4241 2018-07-29 21:42:34 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4242 2018-07-29 21:42:17 They could be repurposed as electrical grid conduits which are more storm proof. Divested funds could support Thorium Nuclear reactors and lets push oil to nuclear energy now.
4243 2018-07-29 21:42:17 I’ve insisted for years that GEJ, his wife & all those who wasted the greatest oil windfall in our history should be SHOT!!! The China solution should be dispensed on them all.
4244 2018-07-29 21:42:05 ... and increase corporate globalism, China cronyism and support for ME tyrannies by paying them for oil & selling them planes?!
4245 2018-07-29 21:42:05 Nothing matters i guess.
4246 2018-07-29 21:41:56 Sorry but surgery doesn't get you through excruciating withdrawl and magically cure you of addiction. She had to have some sort of treatment to get off said pain meds she was abusing AFTER the surgery. And wasn't her little trolls bashing the oil wife life for being in recovery?
4247 2018-07-29 21:41:48 Palm Oil is pretty ubiquitous. It’s in groceries, personal hygiene products, cleaning products, you name it. It’s not always explicitly listed as palm oil on the ingredients label.
4248 2018-07-29 21:41:43 Ugh.
4249 2018-07-29 21:41:35 Oneka, do you think there is a misconception in international media about Guyana and its handling of its major oil resources? Do you have any concerns or questions regarding the oil deal with Exxon Mobil? Please tweet some of your thoughts for our show to @AJStream.
4250 2018-07-29 21:41:27 Happy to hear there's a lot of Greeks in Hot Lanta. Watch out for those  boys though; it's something in the olive oil
4251 2018-07-29 21:41:11 My favorite hobby is forgetting chapstick in my pockets so that when I dry my clothes, there are chapstick oil stains on every clothing item 
4252 2018-07-29 21:41:06 Spilled hot oil over my hand :'(
4253 2018-07-29 21:41:05 Did we elect Buhari to remind us of the price of oil?
4254 2018-07-29 21:41:02 @DrPinna I have an H Pylori infection and it didn't go away even after the whole course of antibiotics (twice), but I read your article that virgin cold pressed coconut oil may help. I am willing to try. Thank you for writing that article. Hope it helps me and others.
4255 2018-07-29 21:41:01 My older one packed everything. My younger one said he’ll just come back & forth as he needs things... which  means food to me lol. They are oil & water too so we’ll see.
4256 2018-07-29 21:40:55 Love, love cauliflower! A little lemon, garlic and corn oil for the gourmet taste . Looks like a giant cloud he's coming into!
4257 2018-07-29 21:40:35 everybody knows that when the 45th president talks the 'truth', a true #Christian dreams about being a #Democrat
4258 2018-07-29 21:40:29 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
4259 2018-07-29 21:40:20 There is already a bump in economic activity, primarily in Georgetown, from Exxon's activities here and this can only increase. Young people especially have to think carefully how they can position themselves for this oil sector and get the relevant education. No free money.
4260 2018-07-29 21:40:17 I remember the things that used to excite me like going to the clubs, lounges, popping bottles, partying like a rock star, baby oil and glitter nights, etc. You know what excites me now? Trying out my new instapot. Wtf?! Who am I? I think my life has been hacked.
4261 2018-07-29 21:40:11 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
4262 2018-07-29 21:40:02 Whoopie. Another insurance salesman selling snake oil.
4263 2018-07-29 21:39:37 Hehehehe … my calming argan oil sensation 
4264 2018-07-29 21:39:26 American prisons are tough, jumping off an oil rig/prison and swimming a few miles to land is easy  #faceoff
4265 2018-07-29 21:39:13 Could be oil and the juices from the watermelon. Idk. Lol. Idk who the hell really sautéing watermelon in the first place tho. 
4266 2018-07-29 21:39:11 The one time I say fuck it I’ll go get my oil changed somewhere I’m stuck here waiting a damn hour and they haven’t even started.. u want something done u do it yourself

4268 2018-07-29 21:38:44 The US has oil reserves exceeding the remaining oil under KSA.
4269 2018-07-29 21:38:43 If everyone went electric with renewable resources, the Oil, Gas and Coal Companies would have a collective Heart Attack, which may not be a bad thing! #Tesla #Solarcity
4270 2018-07-29 21:38:39 @4aBetterGuyana Derwayne, do you think the people of Guyana will benefit from the oil deal with Exxon Mobil? Why or why not? Would like if you may tweet some of your thoughts to @AJStream for our show tomorrow.
4271 2018-07-29 21:38:24 Have you been feeding it? They tend to run away to look for oil
4272 2018-07-29 21:38:09 Have to agree there. I belong to several anti-trump FB groups and a few other rather irreverently humorous groups that make it a worthwhile oil occasionally
4273 2018-07-29 21:37:48 Been doing a lot of research on CBD oil I’m going to try it out. Help with my muscle pains etc.
4274 2018-07-29 21:37:46 بس انا احب ريحة ال coconut oil ؟
4275 2018-07-29 21:37:34 @vidyaratha Vidyaratha, I'm a producer with @AJStream and would would love if you may tweet some of your thoughts on whether you think the oil deal with Exxon Mobil will benefit the people of Guyana and its economy and why or why not? Hope to hear from you!
4276 2018-07-29 21:37:34 COCONUT OIL
4277 2018-07-29 21:37:24 Mark, Iran used the UK to build its oil production infrastructure under agreement to sell exclusively to BP, then they broke the agreement and nationalized their oil. That caused the UK to blockade and commandeer oil transport vessels.
4278 2018-07-29 21:37:19 I thought my oil pen wasn’t working bc I would hold it and nothing would come out the light was literally green and I almost broke down crying but I guess it was off lmao
4279 2018-07-29 21:37:18 Elite Donors Push the Galactic Republic Left on Repealing Roe V. Wade, But Right on Oil Subsidies
4280 2018-07-29 21:37:11 Why would you piss a bottle of olive oil if you don't want to trade zombie secrets?
4281 2018-07-29 21:36:57 IF anyone paying attention and NOT MSM.. the IRAN threaten US shipping.. 1st..
President Trump responded we will respond. 
We did not make war or declare war..  it's IRAN the TREATING FORCE to OIL for WORLD & USA!
4282 2018-07-29 21:36:53 @LaDanzaMacabre -I know I shouldn't, but I like that Clorox cleaner smell you just used.

Me- That's my lemongrass essential oil...
4283 2018-07-29 21:36:44 The pork shoulder in my oven smells so good. It's got about another hour of cooking, marinating in the olive oil and honey barbecue sauce marinade I created.
4284 2018-07-29 21:36:42 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! Russia is controlled by Oil and Gas Oligarchs. They are literally in the ministries. Do you know ANYTHING about Russia? You are willfully uninformed. No excuse with the internet
4285 2018-07-29 21:36:38 In fact the Council of All Tribes here in the USA has their very own GOP!  Yup, they are the ones who sold out their own people.  Sound Familiar?  Now council leaders are millionaires while the #WaterProtectors are hunted & imprisoned on hyped up charges.  Oil bought the land.
4286 2018-07-29 21:36:35 Chanos mostly. The rest from Koch bros and big oil. $$$ #tslaq
4287 2018-07-29 21:36:34 Oil may go to $100 one day again...or it may go to $26 again...IDK..in the meantime..I will keep trading level to level and what I see...you guys keep doing what you are doing
4288 2018-07-29 21:36:16 When you think you’re sweating but really it’s your coconut oil lavished and living its best life. I smell like cookies, you smell like ass lol
4289 2018-07-29 21:36:14 i'm back, oil filter gotten, oil itself, not.
4290 2018-07-29 21:36:12 @KhujLeeFamily Yar isko zara roast karo without Oil
4291 2018-07-29 21:36:11 A brightening facial mask, deep white, with coconut oil, egg white, and exfoliating coconut fiber. It's sold as a block wrapped in paper.
4292 2018-07-29 21:35:44 girl I got attacked by mosquitos this morning.. you need lavender oil and that benadryl stick thing.. saved me!!
4293 2018-07-29 21:35:26 why not cultivate palm oil in deforested places instead of cutting down forests to clean water and prevent deforestation
4294 2018-07-29 21:35:18 hi friends! i’ve had a few people order some rollers from me and it’s helped out a LOT! if you’re interested in a personalized item or essential oil roller blend lmk! it’s been a huge blessing and i appreciate everyone’s support for my family and i as we transition
4295 2018-07-29 21:35:15 Brown parents and logic are like oil and water. They don't mix.

4299 2018-07-29 21:34:29 Repubs gave billions in tax cuts 2 drug companies earning record profits by jacking up prices for patients. Big oil got huge tax cuts & is getting rich off rising gas prices. Wall Street banks are pocketing huge profits instead of working 2 improve the economy. W got very little
4300 2018-07-29 21:34:29 Im f***ing crying at this!!! How’s the motor tho son?... need any oil 
4301 2018-07-29 21:34:20 That's d thing. This govt is not about favoring individuals for d collectives. No. No favoritism. The govt is considering revoking all oil blocs given come 2019 when licensing will b due. Believes d oil blocs b in d hands of d ppl n communities. How do you want such b happy?
4302 2018-07-29 21:33:37 Yes, but there are lapses in the Constitution, loopholes. FG just deployed 1000 armed forces to zamfara...if the governor was truly the 'CSO', he'd be able to recruit more security operatives and protect the people better.
4303 2018-07-29 21:33:37 Hands of butter. Jereboams of deep fat frying oil.
4304 2018-07-29 21:33:31 But Tori, what if I don’t use anyway Palm oil products?
4305 2018-07-29 21:33:11 Somebody just told me to get on those or oil burners
4306 2018-07-29 21:33:10 69 per barrel is crude oil price not Petrol price.
4307 2018-07-29 21:33:02 business is socialized to a large extent such as oil depletion allowances which includes all mineral extraction and timbering.
4308 2018-07-29 21:33:02 To oil you both up  your boy from Boston
4309 2018-07-29 21:33:00 But now i can call u

Olive

oil

Haha
4310 2018-07-29 21:32:59 Number Three is quite ominous. Do they expect trouble in world economy cuz they plan to make it? I suppose there are ways to kick  economies in toilet and boost oil prices, but not my bailiwick. As a nation who’s basically an oil company w/ nukes low oil prices suck.
4311 2018-07-29 21:32:58 Sensational with the chilli oil them, been the gaff for years that
4312 2018-07-29 21:32:54 I’m going through your food and looking for palm oil products when I get home
4313 2018-07-29 21:32:50 The way @ManUtd is going down,  they will soon discover crude oil
4314 2018-07-29 21:32:47 Abi o. They could make crocodile dance in SouthEast, ordinary fowl couldn't crow at Zamfara, Benue, Yola and Borno. Killings are ongoing everywhere including their own base but their search light is at Otueke, because the oil is from there.
4315 2018-07-29 21:32:40 And I agree with both of you!
4316 2018-07-29 21:32:34 Heid..... i’m not, but this country at times tries its hardest to make people racist..... that’s absolutely disgusting by #itv.. they should be ashamed of themselves.... whatever happened to the best person for the job? Good luck to him or 
4317 2018-07-29 21:32:11 @Mobil1 ... the oil for pricks who disappoint their sons in order to play golf with @KevinHarvick. #Mobil1 trashes family values, what will it do for your engine? #NASCAR #FantasyNASCAR #PoconoRaceway #Pocono #GanderOutdoors400 #ReadTheBible #CorporateGreed #Repent #Mobil1scgp
4318 2018-07-29 21:31:58 Do Hindus have oil though ?
4319 2018-07-29 21:31:44 I wouldn't go with that. The best way to boost your beard's growth is naturally, and those natural ways are mentioned in the article. The only product you should put on your face or use in any other way is a beard oil.
4320 2018-07-29 21:31:43 Your tweet likewise doesn’t matter cos it can’t changed what he said
4321 2018-07-29 21:31:31 Thanks man. I’ll trade yah a shirt for some beard oil!
4322 2018-07-29 21:31:28 1. I wouldnt be shocked if Issa admitted using motor oil in his hair
2. He is basically saying, there is nothing Trump could do to lose his support
4323 2018-07-29 21:31:12 California Canes taste like burnt oil tbh. It’s all about that 702
4324 2018-07-29 21:31:10 Any conspiracy theories involving oil are usually duds as well.

There’s a global market for oil. Countries sell at the market price, unless subsidised for own consumers, or eg Venezuela-Cuba

And the US is now about self-sufficient
4325 2018-07-29 21:31:07 In related news... Assos chamois creme, with tea tree oil as one of its ingredients. Clearly developed for perverts.

Brings back bad memories of when I shaved (not my face) (for Reasons) using menthol & tea tree shaving foam. Bad Memories.
4326 2018-07-29 21:31:02 If you think i'm going to abandon my country, parents, siblings, friends and all the oil wealth in Nigeria and move to another country, then you are absolutely right!
4327 2018-07-29 21:30:58 add oil
4328 2018-07-29 21:30:41 :/ am I crazy or ignorant to think that HRC would have had virtually no way to keep oil prices down?  Like, she could have this goal in her mind & diplo efforts but little practical control
4329 2018-07-29 21:30:30 Nothing do with with high level government corruption, drop in the price of oil which their economy was reliant on and subsequent screw up of how to handle it. Your getting good at this politics malarkey Rebecca ;). Nevermind nuanced complex problems, a soundbite will do.

4333 2018-07-29 21:30:18 Lol very observant! Potatoes and rolls and oil! ;-)
4334 2018-07-29 21:30:16 We hope that their leaders channel the resources into developing other areas of the economy.

Oil killed agriculture in Nigeria.
4335 2018-07-29 21:30:11 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
4336 2018-07-29 21:29:47 Avo oil is good however I grill it all so moot point 
4337 2018-07-29 21:29:38 @NASCARONFOX wtf throw the caution the 22 is slow on the track and possibly putting oil down. Or do you not want the #4 to win again
4338 2018-07-29 21:29:36 I love oil but I have no patience for it! This buddy is all acrylic!
4339 2018-07-29 21:29:20 oh Liz..so sorry...i grew up in the 50s/60s--they acted as if a headache was a silly, "ladies" complaint.  Recovering from a bad one in college I smoked a joint (go figure) but within seconds I felt 100% better.  I never looked back, I'm 70 and it is my only med (and cbd oil)
4340 2018-07-29 21:29:12 YYYYYEEESSSS!!!! FOR ITS OIL AND MOTHER RUSSIA AND TURKEY ALONG WITH ISRAEL SHALL PROVIDE THE PIPELINE AND SHIPPING OF OIL CARGOES!!! IT WAS THEIR INTENTION ALL ALONG TO DEMONIZE IRAN TO GET THE OIL OUT OF BOTH SYRIA AND IRON! DAMN!!!!!!
4341 2018-07-29 21:29:07 My white ass just put tanning oil on. Pray for me.
4342 2018-07-29 21:28:57 Evening Prof. I would like to know, what should I use to cook my food? Is olive oil, coconut oil and holsum fat okay? Or should I just boil or steam food?
4343 2018-07-29 21:28:46 But yes 100% something NEEDS to be done about the homeless and schools in Alaska. But I do not think taking a stable reimbursement away from Alaskan people is the solution. I think politicians need to take responsibility of the terrible budget crisis and think about taxing oil
4344 2018-07-29 21:28:19 I am not taking orders as yet asbI have a Rossi oil to do next. No time currently to do a painting of William.
4345 2018-07-29 21:28:17 What did he do to bow to Putin
Increase Nato 
Become largest oil producer
Export LNG to EU
improve our economy
Call out Germany for buying LNG from Russia
Increase our military
4346 2018-07-29 21:28:10 Iran  is the true heart of Persia where as the power & influence the Saud family exerts comes from oil revenue & tyranny . Iranians are not stupid people & lets not forget who toppled their elected Gov't in favour of the SAW. 
Extremes breed extremes. (in case you didn't know?)
4347 2018-07-29 21:28:02 • bobby pins / hair ties 
• mint/ gum
• oil absorbing sheets and some powder ( if you apply makeup )
• makeup removing wipes ( if you apply makeup ) 
• deodorant or body spray
4348 2018-07-29 21:28:01 I only use coconut oil to melt my makeup off but I wash my face right after and use a toner and all that
4349 2018-07-29 21:27:50 
Well, if we stopped spending billions of dollars blowing up other countries for oil, we could afford to take care if the country we're in.
4350 2018-07-29 21:27:49 That has to be the cleanest post-race truck I've ever seen. It looks like it can run a 600 mile race at Charlotte.
4351 2018-07-29 21:27:21 Beard oil is a cool product to have.
4352 2018-07-29 21:27:19 Ofc its not worth, besides oil is unecesary there is electricity. Is this Trump who allowed this
4353 2018-07-29 21:27:07 I have CBD oil. And warm water. We shall see.
4354 2018-07-29 21:26:43 I just know you stashed some money oil away for ya premium select members
4355 2018-07-29 21:26:38 *You're supporting him to build a ranch in your state while he is about to build an oil refinery in Katsina, your mumu is follow come ©* ‍‍‍‍
4356 2018-07-29 21:26:34 1978. Europe and the 'Arabs' signed a deal for oil. Visas were relaxed for people from the Middle East
4357 2018-07-29 21:26:32 This is a stretch for monster movie, but Armageddon does feature meteorites destroying cities, and private enterprises and oil drillers being better than NASA at their jobs.

4362 2018-07-29 21:25:29 More like Jobs for Albertans, not Canadians as a whole. Alberta needs to stop denying the fact that oil and economic mismanagement under 45 yrs of PC govts put them in an ecommerce hole and stop pushing pipelines on Canada. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet
4363 2018-07-29 21:25:07 Like oil and water, Trump and the truth doesn't mix?
4364 2018-07-29 21:24:43 oil = pétrole mdrrrr
4365 2018-07-29 21:24:37 Was asked what my favorite essential oil was today....

I answered, "bacon grease" - that's one of them right?
4366 2018-07-29 21:24:26 True, I think the battery is a diversion from some other trick, the amount of smoke they blow the must be close to the oil burn limit
4367 2018-07-29 21:24:22 you ever just....almost drop a glass container full of oil, think to urself “good thing i didnt drop that”, then two seconds later it falls and breaks and oil spews out from every direction and splatters all over your clothes. i love it
4368 2018-07-29 21:24:15 And you’re no oil painting yourself are ya sweetheart
4369 2018-07-29 21:23:57 Oil.. and it’s lacquered
4370 2018-07-29 21:23:52 Abeg. OBJ met less than 10% of what Buhari met when he (OBJ) became president in 1999. Nigeria's debt profile was at its highest ever and oil was selling for $20 per barrel.
Still, we didn't go into recession and the economy was on steady growth.
This administration just failed
4371 2018-07-29 21:23:46 We spent 3bn USD in searching for oil in the north, and are to spend 2bn USD to build a refinery that will depend on imported crude from another country, and we are the 6th largest oil producers in the world.

Do You know what 3bn + 2bn USD would do to WARRI and PHC refineries?
4372 2018-07-29 21:23:33 Aminu, what lessons do you hope Guyana will draw from Nigeria's experience handling its own oil resources?
4373 2018-07-29 21:23:23 The trouble with this country is that we invent something then for wont of a million quid or so we sell it on to "Jonny foreigner". Namely tilting trains, Rotadynes, radar, oil from coal.
4374 2018-07-29 21:23:21 Cotton balls with tea tree, peppermint or eucalyptus oil. I been doing that and it's effective 
4375 2018-07-29 21:23:17 In n out and five guys fries are vegan! They don't have any fried meat on their menus so the oil is only used for fries
4376 2018-07-29 21:23:12 @Greenpeace instead of going after the Canadian Oil Sands which is ethically mined, why don’t you ALL do something about this?
4377 2018-07-29 21:23:11 Meme idea: a variation on the Italian hand gesture meme, except for Lebanese people and you always include olive oil
4378 2018-07-29 21:23:04 If your sports WhatsApp group is not discussing Jose Mourinho, please delete yourself .  I dey die for one top right now. Somebody say ‘oil dey your brain inside eh’. 
4379 2018-07-29 21:22:56 I’ll eat the biro cover and the biro even
4380 2018-07-29 21:22:52 Keep in mind that economic sanctions and the central banksters have ruined Venezuela. Communism sucks hard core and that has not helped but lower oil prices and economic sanctions have taken their toll as well.
4381 2018-07-29 21:22:41 Just put oil on the tin! Either spray oil or just normal oil, or butter
4382 2018-07-29 21:22:35 Slice off the top of the bulb, put some olive oil and a bit of salt on it, cover in foul and roast...bake at 400 for approx. 30 minutes. When its done the cloves will squeeze out easily. I can eat whole bulbs like this, softens and sweetens the flavor.
4383 2018-07-29 21:22:30 Chicken greese and olive oil
4384 2018-07-29 21:22:28 1: All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis products, such as CBD oil, on board flights. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these products while screening your property.
4385 2018-07-29 21:22:10 I'm not a fan of the mainstream media. But facts are facts: Joe Kennedy founded Citizens Energy Energy Corp in 1979 to provide low-cost home heating oil. The nonprofit bought crude oil from Venezuela at a special price and sold it off at market rate, for Massachusetts residents.
4386 2018-07-29 21:22:10 If teams used PJ1 in their engines instead of oil that would have not been a problem
4387 2018-07-29 21:21:57 Thanks Kemba, what do you mean by diversify its economy and what challenges do you think an oil deal with Exxon Mobil may present for Guyana's economy and people?
4388 2018-07-29 21:21:39 Do y’all use cbd oil/pens?
4389 2018-07-29 21:21:20 Stop studying  or put biro cover in your mouth while studying

4393 2018-07-29 21:20:55 Thanks Zephryn, appreciate you tweeting in - can you tweet us more of your thoughts before our show tomorrow at 3:30 PM EST? We would love to hear more about what kinds of questions and concerns your friends/family may have in Guyana regarding the oil deal with Exxon Mobil.

-me hechas gas oil que no tengo nafta?
4397 2018-07-29 21:20:14 There's literally no burning of oil or gas anywhere near my apartment but thanks for the tips, frens
4398 2018-07-29 21:19:58 I don’t think this CBD oil works for me 
4399 2018-07-29 21:19:57 Missing is how long it will take the world to stop burning oil, gas and wood.  How long will it take to replace petrol burning cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, power plants, furnaces and hot water heaters.
4400 2018-07-29 21:19:37 Greed driven bias? These are the basics of the earths energy balance. The real greed driven bias is the denial side which has the backing of some of the largest corporations in the world, oil companies. Cmon take a class on energy balance and radiational transfer
4401 2018-07-29 21:19:34 #arctic, #polarbearshooting, #savethearctic. Trump wants to drill oil in Arctic even tho US has surplus oil - killing pristine, natural enviros! Why? An arctic tour ship killed a polar bear bec they wanted to walk among the polar bears! WTF! Stay home & watch vids! Cheaper!
4402 2018-07-29 21:19:32 I love roast chicken! But poached and then covered with ginger, spring onion and then drizzled in hot oil for aroma and flavour is more in keeping with the cuisine I was attempting to recreate.
4403 2018-07-29 21:19:26 Peppermint oil I make a roller with peppermint and lavender oil with a sweet almond oil carrier Friends say it works
4404 2018-07-29 21:19:15 Booo does your gym have the water massage tables ????? Can you get there?? Also Epsom salts baking soda peppermint oil and lavender helps the pain. Praying for you

4406 2018-07-29 21:19:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
4407 2018-07-29 21:18:44 Ain't that the truth. You better not be black and try to use this law. They will oil yo ass up every time!!!
4408 2018-07-29 21:18:43 Costco shopping list:
* Diapers-  160 count(forever & ever & ever, amen *longsuffering sigh*)
* Goldfish Crackers- 3 resealable bags (which should've been enough for 3 months, but somehow only lasted 3 weeks)
* Olive Oil- 1 gal. 
* Dry Shampoo- all of it- clear the shelf
4409 2018-07-29 21:18:43 Had a much needed hit of cannabis oil, now I'm all zyzyxxzyzydjsjfjn x
4410 2018-07-29 21:18:34 the ordinary hylauronic acid (idk how to spell that) is great and for moisturiser i use jojoba oil they both work rly well for dry skin!!
4411 2018-07-29 21:18:30 Thanks William, what do you hope will happen and what steps do you think government officials should take to handle the oil deal with Exxon Mobil?
4412 2018-07-29 21:18:18 We should create cattle colonies in the southern part of Nigeria that has oil but no cattle, and build refineries in the nothern part of Nigeria that has cattles but no oil.
This is a rare wisdom indeed.

@MrStanleyNwabia @akaebube @segalink @henryshield
4413 2018-07-29 21:18:17 Oil dark would vote ‘leave’
4414 2018-07-29 21:18:12 Had brunch at Ikea today with the famjam. Some really Swedish haddock and chips dripping oil, garlic bread with butter and my all time favourite chocolate-walnut pie. And free refills of coffee, of course, which I exploited to the max, as usual.

Can't not end with frozen yogurt!
4415 2018-07-29 21:18:02 They can't stop the distraction saudia Arabia will stop it's oil flow.
4416 2018-07-29 21:17:41 Why build a refinery to buy crude from a Niger that has less than 1billion  barrels oil reserve,  Nigeria that have 37billion barrels of reserve with a potential for more discoveries, does it make any form of sense to you?
4417 2018-07-29 21:17:35 It’s made of oil drums, took them bloody ages to construct too
4418 2018-07-29 21:17:33 This is a parody account I think
4419 2018-07-29 21:17:28 OK I'm not, who is Danjuma? Someone wit big political influence, someone who can dial d president, d army chiefs but instead did differently. All prelude 2019. Check out ppl who has been shouting lately ppl who has so much to lose. Ppl who are afraid of losing oil blocs etc.
4420 2018-07-29 21:17:22 Vinegar and olive oil is a basic dressing
4421 2018-07-29 21:17:18 Thanks Mohammed, can you elaborate a bit more one why national interest must be prioritized over political interests when handling a nation's oil resources?
4422 2018-07-29 21:17:15 Using past experience it takes a long time to clean up when the car drags oil through an entire turn right in the groove
4423 2018-07-29 21:17:02 I thought @iowaspeedwayused had used up the entire worldwide supply of oil dry compound yesterday.
4424 2018-07-29 21:16:55 It really helped my genetic chronic migraines. It’s not snake oil. I was able to go without medication because of acupuncture in my neck and ears
4425 2018-07-29 21:16:54 Obama's 8 year average was 1.5%... pathetic...  The stock market during his years was carried by big oil, new directional drilling and fracking investments.. Barry had very little to do with it.
4426 2018-07-29 21:16:54 Venezuela gives the senior citizens and minimum wage workers of MA oil for the harsh winters; we'll see. There are liars and there are those who are on the front line who report the actual truth; not some agenda garbage that the MSM has been pumping into the minds 4 years.
4427 2018-07-29 21:16:50 Not even small small coconut oil to moisten 
4428 2018-07-29 21:16:49 i'm supposed to get the rest of the cleaning stuff tomorrow which is good because a bit of the oil did end up on the front and i would like to remove that
4429 2018-07-29 21:16:49 Lemongrass essential oil 
4430 2018-07-29 21:16:46 There needs to be a new rule in NASCAR where if you blow an engine then stop where your at not go around the track and put oil down #NASCAR #GanderOutdoors400 #Pocono
4431 2018-07-29 21:16:40 That was due to the OPEC oil embargo. Trump is trying to reduce our enormous trade deficits in manufacturing, given the large impact is has on jobs.
4432 2018-07-29 21:16:18 Thanks for tweeting in Bilal, can you explain from your perspective what happened in Ghana and with its oil and what kind of lessons you hope Guyana may learn from the experience of your country? Please tweet @AJStream your thoughts.
4433 2018-07-29 21:16:18 Lisa is awesome but that’s about it. I’ve been twice and both times were mediocre. This time I went for a pedicure and a full set and paid $127 to still have dead skin on my feet and couldn’t even be offered some cuticle oil.  my toenails aren’t even shiny bc he put the lotion
4434 2018-07-29 21:16:18 you should do a hot oil treatment 1-2x a week. it'll maintain the shine and texture, strengthen it, prevent split ends and increase blood circulation to your scalp.
4435 2018-07-29 21:16:09 Check your Engine oil this morning.
4436 2018-07-29 21:16:08 We the sons of the mekunus should say what
4437 2018-07-29 21:16:06 I’ve had bronchitis for almost a month and I used eucalyptus oil to relieve it and it was sooo helpful to me so I still use it to help me sleep cause sometimes my nose gets stuffy so eucalyptus oil works like magic
4438 2018-07-29 21:15:51 IF YOU WASH YOUR FACE IN THE SHOWER MAKE SURE TO DO IT AFTER YOU SHAMPOO AND CONDITION YOUR HAIR OR ELSE YOU’LL JUST BE GETTING MORE OIL AND DIRT IN YOUR PORES 
4439 2018-07-29 21:15:46 Whip together 2 quarts dairy with 8 oz chicken. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Roast. Serve over basmati rice.
4440 2018-07-29 21:15:38 19:18 And many among them hath the LORD said, The head of all men, and went whithersoever they could not believe, surely ye are justified by faith, we have found any of the ruler of the LORD: but such as love thy neighbour, and an hin of oil.
4441 2018-07-29 21:15:37 I do but I have my Imodium, buscopan, charcoal capsules and peppermint oil to hand, it is worth the risk x
4442 2018-07-29 21:15:17 It is not all due to Iranian Sanctions. A large part of this poverty is due to the economic structure of the mullah’s regime and the IRGC. The Iranian government for the last eight years, has received $700 billion in oil income.
4443 2018-07-29 21:15:03 lol when ever he tweets Iran the oil goes up please don't remind him gas. You American have money we poor suffer
4444 2018-07-29 21:14:49 The constitution made him the CSO of his state not me
4445 2018-07-29 21:14:46 Data Breaches are like Oil Spills --- Organizations loss your data, have minimal accountability for their action (Thx Congress), and complain about how much it will cost to fix their prior business decisions. They also ignore the impact on customers, partners & the environments.
4446 2018-07-29 21:14:42 Not true...that was all absolved following our imbecilic pull out of Iraq. Iran owes us Billions in oil from the 80's.
4447 2018-07-29 21:14:38 Dudes at autozone always look at me weird when they see me buying oil for a diesel truck for my car
4448 2018-07-29 21:14:35 Russia by and large is a weak economic player, sanctions work. Keep applying pressure on their oil and gas exports and keep investing in green energy cause, fuck em. If they can't get with the times they need to pack it in.
4449 2018-07-29 21:14:30 Yeah and had to oil down the groove. Should make things interesting though.
4450 2018-07-29 21:14:26 And now for a vicious #Subtweet:

My usual at Subway is a tuna footlong on wheat with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, extra black olives, salt and pepper, oil, and vinegar.

What's yours?

@PeterMBurman
4451 2018-07-29 21:14:24 gracyn and i looked at school supplies in target, got popcorn, and we got some fun sheet masks. also, i found tea tree oil for $2 so I'm hyped.

4457 2018-07-29 21:13:44 @katieejayy_4 just told me my eyebrows are growing and look thicker. This castor, coconut and vitamin e oil is doing me some wonders 
4458 2018-07-29 21:13:31 Woke up feeling fantastic this morning. 
Was it because I was able to attend a dog show? 
Was it because I was able to hang out with friends? 
Was it because of the CBD Oil? 
Maybe a combination of everything? 
I'm not sure, but I'm liking it!
4459 2018-07-29 21:13:22 Y are you so suddenly obsessed with Kwankwaso ,go and do your job and stop looking for sentiments out of this,your camp should continue their permutations while they do theirs,we the electorates  have our brain and know what's best for us,we can clearly differentiate.
4460 2018-07-29 21:13:21 Or we can do both, celebrating the fact that the “Peak Oil” hysteria of the last several decades has ended up being completely false, and leveraging this case as a learning experience for our response to future hysterias that emerge based on faulty assumptions.
4461 2018-07-29 21:13:18 Of course he is and IMO, his take was moronic and I'm entitled to mine :)
4462 2018-07-29 21:13:13 the Russians have oil and the Chinese have a huge internal market. Turkey has a much more vulnerable economy.
4463 2018-07-29 21:12:58 Why do you look like an oil painting though
4464 2018-07-29 21:12:56 “What about all the *good* things our oil spill has done?”
4465 2018-07-29 21:12:54 3/ ...with oil prices and the futures curve: incentivize E&Ps to risk-take and deploy long-dated capital after an epic oil downcycle. Result: E&Ps are finally starting to respond to E&D outside of North America   #OOTT
4466 2018-07-29 21:12:41 Right!!! Like at first it's great but after a few weeks it dries and it's hard to build up even with a bit of olive oil :( i will tho !!
4467 2018-07-29 21:12:05 超キュートに描いて貰って、感謝ですっ！
4468 2018-07-29 21:11:54 a guy I know did an oil painting of Aidan Turner, asked him to sign it at LFCC, then Aidan bought it off the guy for £1000. 
4469 2018-07-29 21:11:53 Sometimes I cover myself in baby oil naked and crawl round the floor like a slug..
4470 2018-07-29 21:11:41 Yeah! :( I put some olive oil but sometimes it gets all runny :(
4471 2018-07-29 21:11:32 For increased, fat free & sugar free carbs + high quality #vegan protein add some Avena Sativa (oats) into your smoothies. Blend & drink quickly to avoid coagulation. Very clean & energizing. For added, positive fats, add a nut butter, avacado, coconut/avacado oil or, cacao nibs.
4472 2018-07-29 21:11:30 Pop’s been gone since 2007 and I treasure the days we shared post race. Especially when the car was in one piece!
4473 2018-07-29 21:11:29 Well I have psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, and restless legs. I get infusions but I use hylands when there is a flare up. I do use CBD oil but it hasn’t be working like I want, I will up my dose to 1500mg. I would try both the hylands and the CBD oil at the same time.
4474 2018-07-29 21:11:19 Or baby oil on tissue or a q tip works well if you're a mom and dont have makeup remover. Great tip dave!
4475 2018-07-29 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: sad crust with wet coconut oil and arugula.

4477 2018-07-29 21:10:35 read the tempest a while back but I barely remember it lmao! then I think I'll tackle things fall apart and the cheviot, the stag and the black, black oil!
4478 2018-07-29 21:10:23 1/ Excellent chart on still-low Energy sector returns in Q2 (E&P and OFS). Upshot: oil prices biased higher mid-to-longer term. Pol’s who think oil prices are “high” are out of step with the level of industry returns needed to motivate long-term supply growth  #OOTT
4479 2018-07-29 21:10:22 Try a Corn & Oil with that pot still I’m cockoo for corn & oils!!!

4487 2018-07-29 21:09:12 @Trenarcisse  Patchouli Oil = Hippie Cologne  that's one of my favorite smells 
4488 2018-07-29 21:09:06 Used to always soak em in olive oil & whatever herbs or spices I felt likely and roast them. Snack of them with wine crackers & cheese. Great for your breath and I’ve never seen a vampire
4489 2018-07-29 21:09:04 Girl this is why I have been taking one Vitamin E capsule a day since I was 23. I also put Vitamin E oil on my face every night before bed. I’m 35 and there are no signs of wrinkles

4491 2018-07-29 21:08:46 He's pushing at an open door there tho. They dont care about the Kurds at all. Most likely point for a fissure with the Europeans is the oil around Cyprus
4492 2018-07-29 21:08:39 おはよーございます
風は大して吹いてないので、大丈夫です

4494 2018-07-29 21:07:55 Ameen Malam
4495 2018-07-29 21:07:53 Do you have any good quality lavender? I clean wounds, then put a little lavender oil on & too it with Neosporin. I think the lavender helps it heal faster. (No idea if it really does, to be clear)
4496 2018-07-29 21:07:47 Rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, chili paste, miso. The tofu is marinated in this same mixture + sesame oil.
4497 2018-07-29 21:07:42 As a matter of fact he put it in the dirty oil one that comes from behind the wall,  which is non flammable,  OldDirtyCookingOil
4498 2018-07-29 21:07:31 Has anyone else used black seed oil before? If so how did it make you feel?
4499 2018-07-29 21:07:27 I ended up washing my face with olive oil because the internet told me to do it.... but it actually worked!
4500 2018-07-29 21:07:23 おはようございます。
お気をつけてくださいね。
4501 2018-07-29 21:07:23 You can’t even cook with olive oil at high temperature, that person is stupid
4502 2018-07-29 21:07:10 Ah nooo oil burns suck  At least it tasted ok? I've only ever had McCain's cakes
4503 2018-07-29 21:06:29 She's  covered herself in olive oil, I went back and saw her grabbing it from the kitchen. 
4504 2018-07-29 21:06:08 I do have RLS- and have tried everything under the sun. For 4 years, been on Mirapex and low dose of oxycodone. Would love a more natural route, but it’s been AWFUL. Thus, diet change and CBD oil.  you?
4505 2018-07-29 21:06:07 Wouldn't it be jes lovely if the flthy rich criminals compensated & returned #oil #money #land to #NativeAmericans it was stolen from ... people were killed ... and their land left a trash dump ... all to enrich outright the thieves & murderers
4506 2018-07-29 21:05:55 Sooooooooo I’m working 30 hours a week now at Best Buy. And I love it but I am in so much pain from my back during 8 hour days. But do you guys know how good it is to have gone from asking people for money to being able to now get my car an oil change? And put money in my savings
4507 2018-07-29 21:05:46 See this geh that has bn fixed in an oil company complaining
4508 2018-07-29 21:05:42 Is palm oil vegan? 
4509 2018-07-29 21:05:40 "I got oil, lane 1," says @KurtBusch Back end of @keselowski's car is destroyed. He goes to the garage #NASCAR
4510 2018-07-29 21:05:35 00 apparently dropping oil...they are in the stall ahead of the 4 team...team debating on whether to come back in again or not...
4511 2018-07-29 21:05:35 RESTART 4/CAUTION 5 - Laps 125-126. Cassill loses a motor and drops oil on track. #NASCAR

4513 2018-07-29 21:05:29 Back to green but caution is out for oil in the groove #NASCAR
4514 2018-07-29 21:05:21 Caution immediately after the restart. Oil in turn one. #NASCAR
4515 2018-07-29 21:05:15 Caution for oil in turn 1. Big break for Harvick. #NASCAR
4516 2018-07-29 21:05:14 We took the green, but we're back under yellow immediately due to some oil in Turn 1. Appears to be from the 00 car of Landon Cassill. 35 to go #NASCAR

#NASCAR
4526 2018-07-29 21:04:31 Confit it in oil. 1) confit garlic is awesome, mild, and ready to use, and 2) you generate garlic infused oil for other uses. Stores well.
4527 2018-07-29 21:04:07 Yep. Just put that oil in your ass and open your ass cheeks as wide as possible!
4528 2018-07-29 21:04:00 'Peak oil' was bunk... but 'global warming'?
4529 2018-07-29 21:03:57 Just cancel their leases the oil in the in America should belong to the American people if not make them pay higher royalties they don't want wind and solar and renewable energies it will cut into their profits that's all they care about they don't care about the environment
4530 2018-07-29 21:03:54 Just got a free oil change

4532 2018-07-29 21:03:50 I wouldn't say it works as well it's only a small amount of oil used

4534 2018-07-29 21:03:19 Mine rarely sold until I was pregnant lol they loved the pregnant belly with oil for some reason. I use to be able to make my daily goal on cam in one gold show doing oil/lotion shows. Now that I'm not pregnant anymore I'm sure they will go back to not selling lol.
4535 2018-07-29 21:03:17 The question posed "unlikely setting" doesn't make much sense to me. Nobody chose Guyana as a destination to have huge oil reserves, that's just how it is. Somewhere has to have oil, Guyana just so happens to be that somewhere in this instance.
4536 2018-07-29 21:03:15 Just to add, crude oil is selling at over 60$ ,where's the development to show for it? What's new
4537 2018-07-29 21:03:10 The cbd oil is the @petreleaf brand
4538 2018-07-29 21:03:03 They either shot it or drive tf out of it cause there’s oil all over like if it popped or some shit
4539 2018-07-29 21:02:51 He will oil to bjp 
4540 2018-07-29 21:02:43 In the early 80s we were assured the world would fun out of oil within 50 years. My FIL who was a chemical engineer with Esso/Exxon his entire career said to us, "in my experience, when people start running out of something they start to look for and find more".
4541 2018-07-29 21:02:42 for real did she just slather cooking oil or melted butter all over herself? #bb20
4542 2018-07-29 21:02:38 Love Georges. Big George with sautéed onions and mozzarella, straight fries (curly are a bit bland - maybe it's the oil but I would assume they'd cook straight in the same oil) and a chocolate shake. Simply cannot go wrong.
4543 2018-07-29 21:02:32 I met a person the other day who says he can't eat Chick-fil-A cuz they use peanut oil... Never heard that one B4...
4544 2018-07-29 21:02:32 Probably gone have Kaity cut my ends, give me a hot oil treatment. Get a silk press and call it a week .

4546 2018-07-29 21:01:56 Starting wars over oil and destabilize other countries is what’s bankrupting your country. But I agree with you on illegal immigration being a bad thing mainly because you can’t screen who’s coming through
4547 2018-07-29 21:01:51 the only major difference this time is presence of btc imo

they are also increasing gold reserves as well

maybe a putinxi coin ico backed by oil/gas/gold 

the VEN "petro" coin was the test run maybe

4549 2018-07-29 21:01:41 All of us know what those challenges are today: a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools
4550 2018-07-29 21:01:21 Maybe the "for her" fries are made from cage free chickens that aren't fed a corn based diet and that they're also fried in coconut oil instead of the cheap shit they use on everything else.
4551 2018-07-29 21:01:19 Never thought I’d be the type of bitch to spend 25 dollars on a bottle of truffle oil but surprise surprise I can’t go 5 days w/o truffle fries
4552 2018-07-29 21:01:13 This cranberry juice is so oil rn 
4553 2018-07-29 21:01:10 One thing I have noticed about this govt is,they're quick 2 respond 2 issues we clamor 4 when a major opposition tweets about it,few minutes ago @KwankwasoRM  talked about #ZamfaraMassacre and boom the @NGRPresident replies.
Pls let's keep pushing them toward their responsibility

4556 2018-07-29 21:00:32 The taxes that go to support medical institutions that provide abortions, much less to actually fund procedures, is miniscule in the budget. Can I object to my tax money going to subsidize oil companies? Or to buy bombs? Those are larger proportions of tax funding.

4559 2018-07-29 21:00:24 July 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4560 2018-07-29 21:00:23 The majority of oil is abiotic! It also renews itself if we give the Earth time to replenish itself.

Also:

Why are we not using H2O-based energy? Its use has been thwarted by collusion.
4561 2018-07-29 21:00:20 Because the Koch$ and oil companie$ have in$tructed them to deny reality. #VoteThemOut

4565 2018-07-29 20:59:25 I know, but these are so blatantly fraudulent snake oil. I'm glad someone is suing CVS for carrying them.

4568 2018-07-29 20:59:09 A deflationary bust is coming but not yet. It will be steep and fast but no depression. An industrial-led recovery will follow. The next recovery cycle will bring on inflation but deflation first. No stagflation. Oil has peaked & will soon be heading south so inflation blip over

4571 2018-07-29 20:58:53 Yes CBD oil will do the trick. Google it
4572 2018-07-29 20:58:50 Considering Norway's sovereign oil fund is now over $1 TRILLION, £64bn is but small change.
4573 2018-07-29 20:58:43 Rendered animal fat and dairy fat. Not carnivore compliant, but I use olive, avacado, and coconut oil occasionally. If you're just cooking meat, it usually comes with its own fat. Just apply heat.
4574 2018-07-29 20:58:41 They have already taken the Cross River oil wells.  Now they want the airport.  And the seaport.  After that, what next?  They are appropriating the culture at the same time.

4580 2018-07-29 20:57:13 Try tweeting again without name calling and using the same tired conservative pro pipelines scare points. Alberta is getting desperate trying to force pipelines on rest of Canada, and still deny oil was the cause of their economic problems. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
4581 2018-07-29 20:57:08 try conditioning only the lengths of the hair, avoid the scalp & see if that improves the oil level! Also 2 much stripping of oils (washing hair everyday or using harsh shampoos with no silicone-free conditioner) will make your hair more oily 2 compensate the oils being stripped!
4582 2018-07-29 20:57:06 Yes, but u could be mistaken.
4583 2018-07-29 20:57:04 what I am saying is there is little difference between oil and tar pretty much of the same process chemically etc

4604 2018-07-29 20:53:58 I’m 49 years old why did it take Africa that long to give me my assets unless black peoples was holding Africa Africa got my Standard oil company every thing I own Black peoples might be holding Africa
4605 2018-07-29 20:53:53 I get that, but still believe he is entitled to his opinion DeRozan. He also said his crappy play last year was all on him and he was planning on proving everyone wrong this year.
4606 2018-07-29 20:53:50 Not that y’all care but the hair journey has begun. While I do this hot oil treatment I’m gonna money on down to Mission BBQ so I have something to eat once I deep condition my hair and sit under this dryer
4607 2018-07-29 20:53:47 do they drill this oil at the buggati factory or what?
4608 2018-07-29 20:53:43 Yea.

Nothing to do with oil prices, the movement of manufacturing and mining to exploit the poor in dictatorships in Africa and Asia.
The huge amount of businesses moving abroad to capitalise on new markets.

Blame socialism lol

4611 2018-07-29 20:52:48 @autozone  so today was a bad day for our hampsteasd md store.  Gave me the wrong wiper blades wrong headlight. And the wrong oil and oil filter for my o7 Ford f150 . Great guys friendly as hell but maybe some more training would go a long way .
4612 2018-07-29 20:52:46 I told her “I love you” and she said “olive oil” smh 
4613 2018-07-29 20:52:43 Lmao. I’ve poured anointing oil on her head. Bewitchment does not stand a chance. 
4614 2018-07-29 20:52:37 I just wanna be like the white people just shampoo and go. But nooooo. Need a hot oil treatment. Then wash & condition. Then Deep Condition. Then a leave in conditioner and that whole LOC method because it really does work smh this is a shift of work
4615 2018-07-29 20:52:33 The fact that you don’t even know enough about science and academia to concede the fact that the grant system is completely controlled by the same companies who’s entire survival and control system is predicated upon old technologies like oil and combustion engines just shows...
4616 2018-07-29 20:52:33 it's not about the many uses of coconut oil, but it is pretty nice.
4617 2018-07-29 20:52:13 My slow-cooked beef belly in dark ale with new potatoes, leeks and pearl onions and a sprig of rosemary got 5 grunts. If the ingredients are top quality, it's not necessary to add 1001 different ingredients.

 Salad on the side. Dressing: olive oil and wine vinegar. That's it.
4618 2018-07-29 20:52:04 @BBCRadio4  I take issue with the statement just made “Scotland is subsidised by England’ regards social care. Our oil has subsidised GB for years.

4622 2018-07-29 20:51:51 Yeah this hair oil is for the scalp, not for styling. I rub it between my fingers then massage on my scalp.

4627 2018-07-29 20:50:28 But what about the $£€ billions of Putin money held by his Oligarchs  in addition to oil, gas, gold, diamonds, weaponry, org crime income streams, etc
Don’t look at how paltry ‘Russian economy’ is, look at Putin the man who gutted RU economy, the richest man on earth.

4630 2018-07-29 20:49:57 I know as OK teachers, if you see that big oil and gas has endorsed a candidate, it’s an immediate turnoff. But if you are a registered R, I strongly encourage you to vote for Dana Murphy on 8/28. She is running a positive and honest campaign and loves our great state.. 1/2
4631 2018-07-29 20:49:47 Crimea. Syria. Ukraine. Oil independence. Increased military spending    All the opposite of Hillary and all against Putin. Sorry no facts to back up Putin claims.

4634 2018-07-29 20:49:31 @ESCOM_Malawi advertises in newspapers...well when I worked 4 Print Media they did & hope they see this because besides Blackouts, Vandalism over the years was a problem including people removing oil from Transfomers. I remember writing stories about that and I assume that's it
4635 2018-07-29 20:49:23 On an oil fundamental note, the fact that: 
1. Cushing still is continuing to draw
2. Saudis halted exports last Thursday
and the market hardly reacted also suggests that this market is tired and a lot of risk has already been priced in #oott
4636 2018-07-29 20:49:11 And I guess a 4.1% GDP, booming stock market, the EU dropping tariffs on the US, peace talks in the Korean Peninsula, sanctions on Iran, better trade with the Saudis for oil, increases in pay around the country, tax cuts benefitting the middle class is bad

4644 2018-07-29 20:47:54 6th Using crackers and Cokers you can reduce the amount of fuel oil. But LSFO will be still a small amount of what fills the demand it will be mainly maritime diesel that will fill most of the demand.
4645 2018-07-29 20:46:59 generally people say shake shack/5 guys/in & out. i know you can’t do 5 guys due to the peanut oil
4646 2018-07-29 20:46:43 Then you can do edibles or use the oil they have ways to use it so banning smoking it doesn't violate your rights just your want to smoke. Suck it up butter cup and stop trying to look like a victim. Others have rights to not smell the odor that comes from smoking to.

4667 2018-07-29 20:43:04 Can they get fuel oil below .5%?
Will IMO 2020 increase distillate demand?
4668 2018-07-29 20:42:55 What r u talking about? Because  I consume oil related products I expect 2 pay 4 my share & every1 else that does (including u) should also pay 4 costs related 2 providing oil 4 r use
4669 2018-07-29 20:42:52 Oil burner pig...nose is made into a dish to hold oil and hole in back to put tealight??
4670 2018-07-29 20:42:40 Is this the last straw?
Is this the straw that broke the camels back?

Whoever comes up with a low calorie or high nutrional value straw wins.
Maybe somethign as simple as straws made of fish oil or molded, hardened hummus.
Or even just wax straws.
4671 2018-07-29 20:42:31 I'm guessing an opposum.

That decomp stench, though. Instaheadache for both of us! 

Reminded me of making wellness check calls as a medic w/a high chance of finding a days dead old person. Mentholatum or peppermint oil under nostrils in case of decomp smell.

4673 2018-07-29 20:42:16 Eh; you can throw diesel, avgas, jp-5, jp-4, lamp oil, whale oil, stale beer and a couple banana peels, pretty much anything that will burn in an AGT1500.

4677 2018-07-29 20:41:51 i cant even finish cleaning bc theyre still cooking and theres oil all over the floor 
4678 2018-07-29 20:41:47 How about a paradigm shift from oil dependence to a more sustainable resource? Allocation of a countries resource shouldn’t be based on geography but more on the most Life threatening problems. These should be solved first regardless of regions. #MypennyMyThought

4680 2018-07-29 20:40:59 Sorry but if I would rather starve then eat any palm oil or palm sugar as the only way 2 protest, sooner or later the biz will go broke. My little act has a ripple effect. It's my bit I can do!
4681 2018-07-29 20:40:36 Sorry. It'll get better soon. If you have it, use Tattoo Goo, aloe Vera, or vitamin E oil prodigiously.

4683 2018-07-29 20:40:25 tuna with olive oil is so much better than regular tuna, how did I not know that? this should be a fact they teach you in the first grade.
4684 2018-07-29 20:40:15 4th Coker’s are used to produce LSFO and diesel while leaving the sulphur in the coke as well. It is difficult to remove sulphur from fuel oil. But refiners are adept at it and the narrative that more light sweet will reduce sulphur content shows little understanding of refining

4688 2018-07-29 20:38:57 Each soap bar from each scent will be $5 dollars. It is a shea butter/olive oil soap base, I added jojoba, avocado, sweet almond and vit. e oil to all mixes, the herbs and flowers are all from my home or hometown and I used the wonderful Young Living EO.

4690 2018-07-29 20:38:43 Why a dream? My brother, with barely a HS education makes $100K as a oil rig welder. I pay maintenance mechanics $60K a year, and I can’t find enough of them. I pay my electricians $75k.
4691 2018-07-29 20:38:28 Oh yeah? I had no idea the working class was a minorty! Holy fuck! You’re right!
Lol Russia ended communism because the population went into decline and they just had to reverse it all. its working so great for the Russians privatised oil and gas into an oligarchy’s hands.

4695 2018-07-29 20:37:40 Not at all. But for a fellow athlete to come out and pull the so-called money card, when that has nothing to do with anything, is laughable. But then again, maybe that is not the case, as clearly the number on his pay cheque is what drives Lucic...could explain quite a bit.
4696 2018-07-29 20:37:17 There's no room for hypocritical snake oil salesman here.  You should be detained at the border and returned to Dante's 8th Circle of Hell, your home.

4705 2018-07-29 20:35:10 Each barrel of oil contributes an amount of energy equivalent to  approximately 300 person-years of labour. That is a huge number.  I will take hydrocarbons before slavery any day of the week.

4743 2018-07-29 20:29:29 Unironically I do think the discourse over burning enemies with oil is a little weird since you're doing that with mages anyway. Tho I get giving Micaiah shit for it since she's fighting for the bad guys and iirc actually gets innocents wrapped up in it
4744 2018-07-29 20:29:21 Think the fuel/oil industry will react well to this one? The local fuel stations don’t seem to care/notice when pumps act up (e.g. frozen screens, erratic behavior). Think the attendants would notice a hacked pump? Cyber training anyone?

4756 2018-07-29 20:26:59 I’m not bothering anymore. I read a piece by @betateach on how his grandad helped shape the oil regulations and was given this certificate to say he was qualified. Little did he know it only lasted five years and suddenly he was not deemed competent anymore.

4767 2018-07-29 20:25:00 Envious of the big-box snake oil manufacturers?  All of your products contain the exact ingredients, you're just the generic brand, a bit less desirable not to mention the digestive side effects...

4789 2018-07-29 20:21:54 Dick's a board member of Genie Energy which is extracting oil in the contested Syrian Golan Heights. Israeli forces are bombing Syrian forces to protect these oil interests. I expect another US War any day now over this, over oil profits for billionaires- yet again.
4790 2018-07-29 20:21:30 We should educate children in what they need to know (agreeing that DL is a priority) and pay for it because we believe it’s important, not because we can get some cash from a guilty party. We don’t, after all, levy oil companies to teach climate change, we teach science.

4798 2018-07-29 20:20:16 Evidently the Brits are after the oil like everyone else but they are also pushing for other reasons, has to be - remember UK is pen holder on both Libya & Yemen and with corrupt UN have used a constitution to destroy or trying to destroy both areas
4799 2018-07-29 20:20:13 Don’t suppose you know the price at which they break even on fracking shale oil/gas ? 
I am curious as UK gov have just given go ahead to start that here. Costs of extraction won’t be exactly the same but in the same ball park I imagine. Cheers.
4800 2018-07-29 20:19:59 Thanks to US economic sanctions, over dependent on oil profits and mismanagement by the current Maduro government.
4801 2018-07-29 20:19:59 Wallahy kuwa.
4802 2018-07-29 20:19:46 Did I just see oil wealth there?

4806 2018-07-29 20:19:12 1977-81 was a blip, due to oil crisis.  Reagan put in place the obvious drivers of this trend:  cut top income tax rate from 70% to 28%, while increasing payroll tax
4807 2018-07-29 20:19:03 Regulations are in place to protect the consumer, workers, and the environment (aka, us). Rolling them back benefits no one in the long run except large corporations and the oil/gas industry.

4809 2018-07-29 20:18:56 Teachers have the education and job prestige of the lower middle class but make working class wages. The same is for police and other first responders. All while, near me, working class oil refinery jobs with less education and prestige are making lower middle class wages.
4810 2018-07-29 20:18:50 Oil changed & new bumper cover on. Time to sit on my ass
4811 2018-07-29 20:18:25 Tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil or olive oil on your roots

4813 2018-07-29 20:18:00 So true. Inorder to take control of the Middle East Oil fields, every country there is a threat.

4818 2018-07-29 20:17:11 What's the meanest #prank you ever pulled on someone? 
For me, I once told a friend you have to flush the engine with a hose after a oil change before you put new oil in and he did it.
4819 2018-07-29 20:17:08 i started using castor oil to make my eyelashes longer and im so excited !!
4820 2018-07-29 20:16:41 I love My smart shake and Nutrimeal from @USANAinc .  My smart shake uses clean and pure ingredients with no added sugars, and coconut oil as the source of energy.  Nutrimeal is certified low glycemic and has a healthy balance of carbs/protein/fat/fiber and tastes great
4821 2018-07-29 20:16:40 Snake oil sales....
4822 2018-07-29 20:16:38 You're welcome. Organic Oregano oil is powerful stuff too.

4825 2018-07-29 20:16:28 I understand entirely babes. My parents were cutting chunks of my hair out since I was three years old. Just go slow and work in tiny sections. Lather that shit in coconut oil and deep conditioner. I cry a lot because of pain and frustration so have snacks and Joe close 
4826 2018-07-29 20:16:27 Coconut oil in my hair.  
Coconut oil on my lips.  
Coconut oil in my beard.  
Coconut oil in my brujeria. 
Coconut oil in my food. 
4827 2018-07-29 20:16:10 as long as you don't go more than 10 - 15 seconds at a time just dipping the bottom of the mold they will loosen and not over liquify.   Next batch take a paper towel and rub a very thin layer of veggie oil or coconut oil on the mold for easier removal
4828 2018-07-29 20:15:59 The best CBD Oil I have ever tried!! I am finally sleeping all night!

4831 2018-07-29 20:15:53 Fried donuts tossed with oil and form into eight pieces or until doubled.

4835 2018-07-29 20:14:12 Oil on water is a very good analogy #BPDChat
4836 2018-07-29 20:14:09 In the case of E15 he's just another RINO politician buying votes. E15 is another damaging government subsidy that's bad for the environment and consumer.

Ethanol was originally started to reduce dependence on foreign oil, not make farmers dependent on government subsidies.
4837 2018-07-29 20:14:06 Thanks. We’ll see if I can stay w it thru football season and the holidays. I’m hoping I’ve made it a habit. Hitting gym 5x week. Lots of salads w chicken & fish. Eggs, Greek yogurt, avocado for breakfast. Fish oil. Limited the booze. Lost my sweetooth craving.
4838 2018-07-29 20:13:57 Purification oil really does fix everything
4839 2018-07-29 20:13:49 Appaz it’s engine oil

4842 2018-07-29 20:13:31 And what type of product are they referring to here? Fuel oil?
4843 2018-07-29 20:13:31 Hi. If it's a bad mood some form of distraction like going on twitter but other stuff often I just have to sit with the pain until it passes as all self soothing seems to be like oil on water #BPDChat
4844 2018-07-29 20:13:16 I sit back and watch the world, through eye holes, in my oil paintings
Uhhh!
4845 2018-07-29 20:13:10 No oil wealth, just oil poverty.
4846 2018-07-29 20:13:03 so muych oil bro
4847 2018-07-29 20:13:00 Yes I know what you mean, I thought that too but they usually knock the power back a lot (people have measured them on dynos). ITG filters don’t but stop all the crap as well. Impregnated with a special oil and you get kits to clean and re-oil. Had them on both my ‘scorts
4848 2018-07-29 20:12:54 Standard Oil ended that...
4849 2018-07-29 20:12:48 @Lexus #customerservice car has burning smell my kids thought the car was on fire.  I assured them it wasn’tTurned out to be an oil leak, later car started shaking all the lights came on.  Told the kiddos  car was break dancing Had the car about a month.
4850 2018-07-29 20:12:27 Love an ice cream! I have a dilemma though! I’m #lactoseintolerant and also, most ice creams seem to have #coconut oil in... I’m allergic to coconuts or coconut oil. Any suggestions @walls ?
Love and Light xxx
4851 2018-07-29 20:12:25 If my mum visited me on #LoveIsland , she would probably try to come with a Bible and a bottle of olive oil
4852 2018-07-29 20:12:18 My homie out of oil too. I’m just hurting rn.
4853 2018-07-29 20:11:59 No-hitting the Dodgers is no small feat and Newcomb is three-outs away from nailing it down. Good luck topping that one kid #Braves
4854 2018-07-29 20:11:57 Being friends with me is like eating some fried chicken then realizing it’s just a bone with breading and oil 
4855 2018-07-29 20:11:52 crude oil prices could slide into a trading range over the near-term. With the sanctions against Iran already priced into the market, traders are likely to continue to react to the Saudi’s halting of shipments and low U.S. inventories
4856 2018-07-29 20:11:52 Careful kid, we're showing our age. How many of us remember the old Popeye cartoons, much less Blimpie.
...and yet they got us to believe Olive Oil was a Babe.
4857 2018-07-29 20:11:51 Not like GWB, under whom countless poc were murdered in our endless war in the name of oil.
4858 2018-07-29 20:11:45 TRUMP'S Middle East agenda may be to invade Iran, receive military support from Russia making PUTIN look like an ally while both strategize stealing Iran's OIL. It would only be a matter of time before Iraq and other OIL producing nations fall to U.S., Russian aggression.

4860 2018-07-29 20:11:31 Students are encouraged to burn the midnight oil, Indian students however, in addition to that, have to burn the midnight coil as well. #Mosquitoes #thirdworld @gatesfoundation
4861 2018-07-29 20:11:20 Oil on the legs!! I use coconut oil or a sun screen oil with factor in it! Works down here in Dorset where they are rife! If her slippy they can't seem to take hold 
4862 2018-07-29 20:11:15 I was curious about what kind of oil you use
4863 2018-07-29 20:11:03 yeah, azan's hair, u'd think he'd used that moroccan oil thing.
4864 2018-07-29 20:10:56 Men, love your beards.
Moisturise those beards.
Put some coconut oil on them beards.
4865 2018-07-29 20:10:43 :,( if you don’t already try using peppermint oil for migraines, shit works wonders 
4866 2018-07-29 20:10:40 This Man should shut up . He thinks Is all about not having oil bloc and houses in Abuja and lagos . We are talking about how Nigerians are dying and the President act Numb .

4868 2018-07-29 20:10:28 Record low minority unemployment, 4.1% GDP, tax cuts saving working families thousands of dollars, peace with NK, fair trade, US manufacturing coming back, record exports of US oil. President Trump is doing a damn fine job! Can’t wait for when Kavanaugh gets confirmed.

4871 2018-07-29 20:09:32 I dont consider people that want open boarders as libertarian, I just dont. I look at someone like Rand Paul as a good definition of a libertarian and I dont see him for open boarders
4872 2018-07-29 20:09:23 They always pressing me to get the premium oil change... if y’all don’t just put the regular stuff in my car and cmon. Talm bout 91.50.... I’ll take that 7 dollar extra virgin canola oil please.
4873 2018-07-29 20:09:23 If not to be so rude, Jerry can spell correctly. He does not seem to throw out blank lies about a by-gone Election unlike yourself. Instead of demonizing a potential trade partner, we should increase the competition between Resources like Oil, Ores, and Lumber.
4874 2018-07-29 20:08:59 Yes, then we realised snake oil salesmen selling opium for random illnesses was a bad thing. What an absolutely insane take on medicine.
4875 2018-07-29 20:08:57 Verified: 

Carter Page met with Russian oil execs of Rosneft. 

The kremlin targeted swing state voters in 2016. 

Trump maintains ties to rich business men from Azerbaijan. 

How much more will be verified? How much more has been verified but is still under investigation?
4876 2018-07-29 20:08:50 The last time that oil was around 46$ a barrel Saoudi Arabia had increased production to drive the prices down to eliminate the shale producers.

4879 2018-07-29 20:08:18 Some ideas are worthy, others not so much.
The open border thing and libertarian econ theory has a lot of holes in it far as I'm concerned. As a pure ideology, scrutiny exposes some defects.
4880 2018-07-29 20:08:02 @CBSBigBrother Pls dont be cheap skates - give the HG decent cups. They shouldn't  have to drink out of random bottles like creamer bottles and veg oil bottles.

Get some branded cups & sell them online-you're missing a marketing opp.

4883 2018-07-29 20:07:57 just read a review of an All Natural Toothpaste where the reviewer complained the company should have added garlic oil and oregano to the toothpaste for added benefits and folks let me tell you: wha
4884 2018-07-29 20:07:49 im gonna start oil pulling today
4885 2018-07-29 20:07:31 While Mount Shasta is on fire and major ecological disaster kills off sea life in Florida, corporations are rushing to put more oil pipelines in the Earth. #FOff #RiseUp
4886 2018-07-29 20:07:19 I know - it's everywhere... that's why we need to push for it to be written into law that all palm oil in products in the UK must come from certified sustainable sources.
4887 2018-07-29 20:07:17 thanks for sharing - what is the best oil for making homemade mayonnaise?  @RochelleBilow @lallimusic
4888 2018-07-29 20:07:01 tar and oil are very alike so he basically lost it on an oil slick
4889 2018-07-29 20:06:46 It is time 2 bury these old scho 'journalism' & start social media as new news std. Why shld ppl's opinion b influenced by a group of 'crooks' rather, everybody have their say and hear each other on same level and reach - thru SM. It will also b a big help in clng the SWAMP !!
4890 2018-07-29 20:06:35 8. Enact a windfall profits tax on excessive oil company profits to provide  a $1,000 emergency energy rebate to U.S. families. 9. Establish a low  national carbon-fuel standard.
4891 2018-07-29 20:06:35 Girls stay putting on tanning oil and not sunscreen even if you tell them were going to a beach in the ass crack of hell
4892 2018-07-29 20:06:34 We don’t have oil. Nor do we have the richness of other primary commodities anymore. Our costs of production are the highest in the world now for gold. 
Time to become a service economy and really add value.
Look how Singapore did it.
4893 2018-07-29 20:06:29 There are special economic actors that need to be exposed , they are generating very bad consequences, this actors are Goldman & Sachs and big oil and some others. Matt Taibbi is a Hero and with courage and fine ironie denounce them.

I’m addicted.
4897 2018-07-29 20:06:13 @MSNBC @CBSNews But of course the Trump adm & GOP don’t believe in climate change. Why b/c it’s about the mighty dollar. Big oil, Koch Bros chemicals, coal industry, just 2 mame a few. They would rather hurt generations of children w/bad air, water & food. Vote blue 2018 save us.
4898 2018-07-29 20:06:12 Just nearly burned me tits off with hot spitting oil whilst frying diced beef without my top on.
4899 2018-07-29 20:06:05 What kind of oil ?? extra virgin olive oil organic farming ?
4900 2018-07-29 20:05:51 Why do they care?  Got some more oil to drill or mine like Alaska?

4902 2018-07-29 20:05:32 Sadly they are also investing billions in the oil industry.
4903 2018-07-29 20:05:28 - Dollar rally accelerates 
- China doesn’t ease and makes a policy error
- More tech based scandals - this time covering more than just FB
- Oil price spike (including ME conflict)
- Trade war escalation
4904 2018-07-29 20:05:14 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
4905 2018-07-29 20:05:12 Un litro de gas oil $40.00 boleto $36.00,hay algo que no me cierra.Cuantos km x litro hace un bus? 6/7km quizás?Cada uno saque sus números y conclusiones.
4906 2018-07-29 20:05:07 Coconut oil and vitamins.
4907 2018-07-29 20:05:01 I think potus knows the word 'scam'  All good snake oil salesmen do.
4908 2018-07-29 20:04:52 Look out for lots of positions in Oil & Gas in the coming days.
4909 2018-07-29 20:04:20 If you give me cookies made with coconut oil and i have never felt so betrayed
4910 2018-07-29 20:04:15 Try a good pure CBD oil!
4911 2018-07-29 20:04:14 Speaking of Oil dens all over their country..... It will only take time and the neccesary measures to achieve it .
4912 2018-07-29 20:04:08 And Big Oil is gonna try to make him fail.

4914 2018-07-29 20:03:44 The problem is they aren't lying when they say they're using vegan oil because they most likely are, but they're frying all their food together in the same oil. A different basket maybe, but 100% the same fryer with the same oil
4915 2018-07-29 20:03:38 “Would you like me to check the oil?” “Yes please - factor 20 if you have it”
4916 2018-07-29 20:03:37 I love using my waterline (sometimes to a fault) for eyes...even if I don’t want to use my bottom waterline, using the top one can add an extra pop...oh and also coconut oil for skin prep before #AskLaura
4917 2018-07-29 20:03:06 Exactly. Those are precisely conditional probabilities that might precede the violent usd/oil feedback. I can see it happening at the same time. Crude demand is pretty inelastic, and the supply is going to be BIG problem going forward (structurally: VZ, the rest is contingent).
4918 2018-07-29 20:03:04 You can twist Russia’s tits by turning up oil production and flood the market. They don’t move the needle worldwide economically but causing conflict is good for their arms sales.

4920 2018-07-29 20:02:42 I’m not convinced there is any truly sustainable palm oil. Just corruption and a wet stamp. #SayNoToPalmOil
4921 2018-07-29 20:02:20 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
4922 2018-07-29 20:02:06 it needs a SPINE in your back to implement these Laws and rules. unfortunately @narendramodi is a failure in that regard. he does not have courage for that either.
4923 2018-07-29 20:01:57 *slathers tanning oil over the spot where I just got a mole taken off for pre-cancerous cells*
4924 2018-07-29 20:01:51 Looks good but Too much baby oil...
4925 2018-07-29 20:01:40 being newly vegan, I was in Asda today perusing sweet & savory treats, apart from there not being much choice for vegans, EVERYTHING  had palm oil in 
4926 2018-07-29 20:01:30 I thought nothing was worse than teeth impressions. And then I tried oil pulling 
4927 2018-07-29 20:01:30 I miss that coconut oil smell on your dry skin
4928 2018-07-29 20:01:30 I miss that coconut oil smell on your skin
4929 2018-07-29 20:01:08 Instead, the media, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

4935 2018-07-29 20:00:13 Please am I the only one that feels when I'm frying something the oil actually knows what it's doing.  Why does it always splash at the right time?
4936 2018-07-29 20:00:13 Sorry Dear to hear that... allot of diffuser today with Lavender and Eucalyptus oil helps and it is more natural... Wish they had better meds but they don't work as quick as needed... I say wear sunglasses at the studio and someone bring fennel tea!  Feel Better..

4938 2018-07-29 20:00:05 @JustinTrudeau , @Bill_Morneau & @jimcarr_wpg have been VERY clear on this topic as of late, it’s about shipping by oil tanker to markets other than the US. They’re the real experts on the topic. They’re the owners! #BlairWhichProject 

Keep lobbying @BlairKing_ca !

4940 2018-07-29 20:00:00 Check oil, brake, power-steering and windshield-washer fluids regularly. These liquids never stop being used and consumed. Speaking of brake fluid, how do the brakes on your car feel in general? Are they lacking in bite?  If so, new pads and a system bleed might be required. 
4941 2018-07-29 19:59:59 Yes, there was an oil crisis while he was in office. And Carter will never go down as one of the best presidents. But right now, he's 92 and building houses for the homeless. Donald Trump is paying off pornstars and kissing Putin's ass. #CharacterMatters
4942 2018-07-29 19:59:45 What cause he drives the best car in formula 1? Stick him in a force India, what’ll happen then? It’s just like Man City buying the PL cause they are run by oil barons... Anyone can win things with the best equipment

4944 2018-07-29 19:59:26 one of the biggest failure of @narendramodi is that, rascals from politics, babudom, press, and NGOs are still roaming free...  modi ji does not have spine to take on these rogue elements. he IS weak.

4949 2018-07-29 19:59:06 The real power is not in the hands of those who control the oil; it is in the hands of those who control the world's reserve currency.

4951 2018-07-29 19:58:40 When previous administration's kept mute over similar issues they were called hypocrites for their lack of empathy towards the plight of the citizenry. Our dear old and his advisers seem adamant in following the same old trend.
4952 2018-07-29 19:58:34 Shale oil will not produce any LSFO from my understanding. Also, I think the driver for prices is because the High Sulfur Fuel will be banned even tho its available increasing demand for LSFO, which has huge land transport demand already.
4953 2018-07-29 19:58:29 Thanks Mal. I will hopefully get to an oil of William later. I have a Rossi oil to do next that has been waiting.
4954 2018-07-29 19:58:20 Who else to take credit? The Fairy that tried to bankrupt the coal industry, shut down oil drilling and exploration, piled on regulation on top of regulation in business? Give me a fucking break already, Wallace. FFS

4964 2018-07-29 19:55:29 @Uber_Support (2/3) they failed to tell me the box was leaking oil everywhere! It completely stained my seats as I put food on the seat next to me. I wanted to detail my car to try to get the stains out, Uber just said you guys don’t compensate and it’s very upsetting it’s a 2015
4965 2018-07-29 19:55:15 it’s made with coconut oil & it uses flavoring to taste the same
4966 2018-07-29 19:55:13 Pro tip when making couscous: use good butter or olive oil. (“Use good olive oil” is the best life advice I can offer, tbh. It changes everything.) I like @KerrygoldUSA ‘s garlic herb butter or the butter infused olive oil from Fresh Harvest Tasting Room in #eurekasprings
4967 2018-07-29 19:55:04 Yes but I was thinking wage driven tightening vs oil issues arising mostly from lack of supply growth (or outages - Iran/Libya/VZ/Nigeria) rather than robust demand
4968 2018-07-29 19:55:02 If you think I am going to leave my family, friends, you guys and all the money & oil in Nigeria , you're right!  

I would follow back.

4970 2018-07-29 19:54:57 This oil is not strong at all. I think I’d call it woodsy. That’s the most fitting adjective.
4971 2018-07-29 19:54:53 Or the #BlairWhichProject Blair’s endless lobbying for big oil, oil tankers and oil spills...where he makes up “whichever” reason against anyone opposing oil spills in their backyard! You don’t want an oil spill? You must be NIMBY! #BlairWhichProject

4974 2018-07-29 19:54:33 All these places cooking in sunflower oil or olive oil, but they’ll tell you it’s fried in buttermilk.
4975 2018-07-29 19:54:26 today's fun fact: oil well logging equipment sends it's data by pulsing the restriction it presents to the lubricating 'drilling mud' pumped down and back up the bore pipe. They get about 10 bits/sec with lots of dropouts.
4976 2018-07-29 19:54:10 Stop the gov't funding & subsidizing of the oil industry & get busy with real funding for the myriad ideas to clean up the mess and in creating alternative products.

4981 2018-07-29 19:53:16 Sorry mate...was a gut reaction in poor taste. I'm afraid some of your fans have been driving us nuts with their jibes lately...small club, oil c***s etc. They're not of your calibre. I only follow a few lfc folk now.

4984 2018-07-29 19:52:48 Sources tell us activists are disheartened. Democrats have put protection of natural parks/wildlife from oil exploration in their party platform multiple times. Dem leaders have amnesia, as evidenced by their recent votes in favor of the #TrumpAdmin on this issue. #Demnesia

4991 2018-07-29 19:51:53 I'm oversimplifing when I say this, but soybean oil is the devil.
4992 2018-07-29 19:51:42 Hmm.. I’ve always been told I have pretty toes! You might be on to something..cash app first, then I’ll oil down these toes down! 
4993 2018-07-29 19:51:35 If you’re not roasting your broccoli with garlic, olive oil and salt you’re doing it wrong. Holding myself back from nibbling or there’s not going to be any left by dinner. Plus, I suspect eating an entire head of broccoli by oneself in an afternoon is inadvisable.
4994 2018-07-29 19:51:35 They also blame the poor build quality and incompetent customer service on short sellers, big oil companies, sabateurs, haters, climate change deniers, pedos, misogynists, deplorables, married women, white males, the russians, CNN....Wait a sec, all this sounds vaguely familiar.
4995 2018-07-29 19:51:34 I think we can all agree it is bad for container shippers & dry bulk... potentially neutral for crude and product tankers... and definitely positive for scrubber manufacturers... and definitely bad for oil sands producers... good for some gulf coast refiners, bad for others
4996 2018-07-29 19:51:26 So @FlyFrontier, pilot says you’ve know about an oil leak on the plane for 12 DAYS. 12. But now is the time to fix it. Been delayed for hours now with no end in sight. Flying with a toddler by myself. Does this sound fun to you? This is unacceptable.
4997 2018-07-29 19:51:00 Acupuncture is snake oil and not worth your time.
4998 2018-07-29 19:50:54 CB tightening/policy error and oil spike are correlated/complementary risks to some extent. Tightening reduces available dollar supply, higher oil price demands more dollars while jacking up crude prices, which in turn increases the demand for usd.. until it lasts...

You provide Zero reasons for supporting selling oil to Asia, an increase in oil tankers by 7X’s and the catastrophic impact you even admit, would the the result of a spill

5072 2018-07-29 19:39:54 What is up with all the hun’s?  Seems unnecessarily demeaning.. 

She is right* we buy massive amounts of oil from SA- who’s royal family was the major funders of Osama Bin Laden’s 9/11 attacks. 

We should all move away from foreign petroleum & invest in reusable energy.
5073 2018-07-29 19:39:39 flatmate who is cooking with oil spluttering everywhere as i speak to her tells me she doesn’t think it’s her who’s getting oil all over the oven top and not cleaning it 
5074 2018-07-29 19:39:30 Yhh moisturiser is important even if you have oily skin or your skin will produce excess oil your makeup won't turn out nice but you need something light and still moisturising
5075 2018-07-29 19:39:28 Oil/cologne that lingers
5076 2018-07-29 19:39:17 Other than skin care routine I HAVE to turn on my oil diffuser and put on an eye mask or else I can’t sleep
5077 2018-07-29 19:39:17 i'm going out to get oil change stuff and other things too.
5078 2018-07-29 19:39:14 The next step would be to sue the Gov. The EPA is responsible for keeping the water clean and they fail. Getting the oil company to monitor itself, that’s where the problem lies.
Failure to protect the citizens water, and court cases, well that seems scammy, and actionable.

5107 2018-07-29 19:35:46 I don't know why we had to go so fast removing the coal fired plants other than to greenwash the oil industry. The coal fired plants were being phased out anyway. So really this is all window dressing for big oil at our expense. Maybe health benefits will balance out costs now.
5108 2018-07-29 19:35:09 Family, I'm extremely happy, joyful and content right now. I'm into essential oils so I would blame it on the peppermint oil I put into my diffuser today, except I woke up feeling blessed. All I can say is, God is good!

5205 2018-07-29 19:21:38 No, @JustinTrudeau says it’s about selling oil to customers OTHER than the US, requiring oil tankers to get it there. There is NO evidence that selling oil to Asia will reduce any tanker traffic in the Salish Sea. In fact, now we’ll have our full tankers passing their tankers.

5208 2018-07-29 19:21:15 Wtf it costs over 20,000 to do a oil change on a fuckin Bugatti!?
5209 2018-07-29 19:20:57 I'm not into women but who else wants to see Anfisa & Pao greased up in baby oil and wrestle in their bathing suits?
5210 2018-07-29 19:20:53 Niacinamide, buffet, AHA/BHA peel, and arbutin are my favs rn! Also the rosehip oil
5211 2018-07-29 19:20:47 The oil has never paid for scotland, even at full productivity.
5212 2018-07-29 19:20:36 i heard of people using coconut oil and shea butter w/ whatever oils they like
5213 2018-07-29 19:20:36 Anyone know where I can get my oil changed today?
5214 2018-07-29 19:20:28 It is not Muslims & Christians
It is not Fulani & Berom
It is not APC & PDP
It is not even an oil region
It is just innocent/helpless villagers that are being killed everyday by only God knows who.
Politically motivated???
And we are all quite?

5216 2018-07-29 19:20:22 How come nobody talks about how expensive Olive Oil is?????
5217 2018-07-29 19:20:21 Exactly what would a 15 year old Honduran girl who has no family do to survive on the streets? While I have sympathy for these ppl, a worse fate awaits many. ICE taken down more thn a few child sex/trafficking rings. Chances of her falling victim? Fairly high
5218 2018-07-29 19:20:10 Chicken fingers with a twist. Coat chicken fingers with flour, egg, milk, salt and potato chips. Fry in canola oil

5220 2018-07-29 19:19:56 so here I am just trying to get gas and this guy is dumbing motor oil and pumping gas into his tank at the same time
5221 2018-07-29 19:19:41 So much like the 2014 economy (Obama's highest growth quarters) there is increased activity but real wages did not increase after Q3 2014 with falling oil prices cutting inflation.  So most middle class are not seeing real wage increases.
5222 2018-07-29 19:19:30 Lamido was part of the PDP led government that ruin the economy with out any savings when we had oil boom.
5223 2018-07-29 19:19:20 Green economies are rising around the world. The people ahead of the wave will become large exporters, creating unimaginable wealth for their country. Anyone still on oil will plummet with its price as the rest of the world moves away from oil, and demand drops to near zero.
5224 2018-07-29 19:19:14 talking slick like it’s oil speakin
5225 2018-07-29 19:19:13 Ok just her feet then clean them well.  Get some tea with elderberry and/or Hawthorne berries and coconut oil. They are natural and will not affect the Little Angel. But my Dear you must R E S T because the baby needs YOU not just for today.  Feel better, I am praying for you
5226 2018-07-29 19:19:04 Rose essential oil, how worth it is it my friends?!
5227 2018-07-29 19:19:01 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
5228 2018-07-29 19:18:52 Pretty priveledge bout to get me a whole inspection on my car, oil change and all that.
5229 2018-07-29 19:18:45 Bingo! Oil!
5230 2018-07-29 19:18:45 My point is factual.

What's your problem?
5231 2018-07-29 19:18:19 Far better and easier to plough on than admit they were sold an impossible future by snake oil salesmen and media tycoons.....
The rest of us unfortunately are heading for the cliff edge on their bus and screaming and banging on the windows.
5232 2018-07-29 19:18:16 what is the best essential oil diffuser ? I’m taking

5233 2018-07-29 19:18:02 When my daughter Carmen Barnes use the Oil that God has given her for the Kingdom is God. I’m so proud of her. She’s in her zone. “WORSHIP”
5234 2018-07-29 19:17:56 I try this American  cowboy company c b d oil it is camel  piss in never buy from themhttps://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/919350/cannabis-oil-uk-cbd-holland-and-barrett-benefits
5235 2018-07-29 19:17:43 Yeah seriously. I have known various alcoholics and I'm so fine with all the ones who are just maudlin or sing badly while drunk. It's like a whole other thing from "throwing hot oil at five year old" (to take example from my life).
5236 2018-07-29 19:17:43 All the while we are closer to a Fed/Interest Rate induced recession (smaller in size, see 1957) in which real wages are diminishing with higher inflation.  Note higher inflation is OIL! which is the biggest piece of increase in business investment.
5237 2018-07-29 19:17:36 Have you ever been entranced by unctious charm? It's worse than being squirted by a burning oil sprayer
5238 2018-07-29 19:17:29 Tips for getting coconut oil out of your hair? I’ve had it on overnight as my scalp was incredibly dry from the sun and constant blow drying. I’ve shampooed it twice with a cleansing repair shampoo. Still feels a tad oily.

5241 2018-07-29 19:16:59 MAN W/SQ.FT "The truth surfaces like oil on water."— Yiddish proverb
5242 2018-07-29 19:16:45 Hmm well it that area they have a choice oil or tourism. I say tourism is the better of the two. Sad a bear died but how many will be saved a a result of tourism and a viable economy over oil.
5243 2018-07-29 19:16:39 As #USA armtwists #Modi to cut #oil imports from #Iran to zero, he has this historic chance to go down in history as a #sissy or make #USA look like one!
But the way he sucked up to #suckerberg, I don't have high hopes from him!
5244 2018-07-29 19:16:37 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
5245 2018-07-29 19:16:14 Buhari shares highest Federal Allocation in the history of Nigeria @ N821.86B to FG, States and LGAs for June 2018 with crude oil price per barrel at less than$74.
PMB gives so much more with so much less.
5246 2018-07-29 19:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
5247 2018-07-29 19:16:07 Guys so overall work today was alright but I'm going to write one bit essay to the company of all the things that were wrong... For example I was trying chippies ona stick all day, had no instructions how to use/work with hot oil... The extractor hood wasn't working
5248 2018-07-29 19:15:51 Incorrect, the alternative to @TransMtn is more, less-regulated Saudi tankers in the Salish Sea; oil-by-rail along salmon-bearing rivers in the Pacific Northwest; and no decrease in ship traffic or ship noise. So your points are simply nonsense.
5249 2018-07-29 19:15:43 Chick fil a used peanut oil and I don’t think other chicken places do plus God goes in ever Sunday and sprinkles his blessings over all their food before the week starts
5250 2018-07-29 19:15:40 On an oil fundamental note, the fact that: 
1. Cushing still is continuing to draw
2. Saudis halted exports last Thursday
and the market hardly reacted also suggests that this market is tired and a lot of risk has already been priced in (barring all out war in the ME of course)
5251 2018-07-29 19:15:37 I do allot of driving with my job, so I'm in the car more. My Dad had to get a new truck and his newer truck had it, and he's trying it out, he likes it. He does allot of traveling between Stanton, Midland and Lubbock going to/from oil rigs and his office. Hard to get a reg radio
5252 2018-07-29 19:15:37 Ahh! I did a cooking course with him in Kerala in 2013. I still think of him when I smell coconut oil 
5253 2018-07-29 19:15:23 Cvs coconuts oil!!
5254 2018-07-29 19:14:57 Who the fuck hates capitalism??  You're smarter than this. You speak of the ills of socialism but I have yet to see you speak about the damage that corperate welfare causes. Corperate bailouts, oil and gas subsidies, or the absolutely criminal war budget.
5255 2018-07-29 19:14:51 Really....it is....maybe the kernel oil will work don't u think so...
5256 2018-07-29 19:14:34 I’m taking fish oil caplets, but there’s no fish flavor thank god
5257 2018-07-29 19:14:26 Try out our oil,very affordable with great result ask @KipkipNoni a try will convince you
5258 2018-07-29 19:14:23 As for Norway, its high-per-capita living standard is enabled by its sovereign oil fund. Sick of it (and Sweden) being used as some excuse that somehow 'socialism works'. Cheers from Europe.
5259 2018-07-29 19:14:22 Thieves oil !!
5260 2018-07-29 19:14:02 Also if they're so adamant on not paying for healthcare of others, could we also opt out of paying for the wages of politicians, subsiding oil companies and stop funding wars we don't agree with?
5261 2018-07-29 19:13:51 Tbh you could change your oil and save that money…it’s easy as hell
5262 2018-07-29 19:13:50 Horrific. Always think why can't someone like @elonmusk invent vacuum system to fill up hundreds of tankers from flood waters in northeast or south (donated from huge oil companies) caravan cross country to help contain wildfires like Redding...
5263 2018-07-29 19:13:46 I started using olive oil and magnolia oil with my normal cream I haven't had problems since. I hope that helps 
5264 2018-07-29 19:13:42 ทิ้งได้มั้ยจานเนี้ยขี้เกียจล้าง
5265 2018-07-29 19:12:37 True, but, even the smallest shards of non~biodegradable plastics harm wildlife. I'd like to see biodegradable vegetable oil based plastics or even hemp used instead. Paper straw use would not be good for our trees. Still, jail time? Not reasonable and smells like distraction.
5266 2018-07-29 19:12:09 But space for oil money FC?
5267 2018-07-29 19:12:08 Which bridge unable dey build. Water and oil don't mix. We r  waiting for d katakana to follow
5268 2018-07-29 19:12:03 I don't know,  have you ever gone to info-wars, all lies & promotions for snake oil. Anyone who goes there & believes their shit is probably to stupid to judge whether to chew gum or walk at the same time. It is pretty pathetic.
5269 2018-07-29 19:11:38 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5270 2018-07-29 19:11:35 الحمار مثلك.  والا لماذا المقاطعه من اربع دول. اش اخبار تميم في زيارته لبريطانيا واشفيهم حشروه في البرلمان
5271 2018-07-29 19:11:28 Cant stop thinking about mint/tea tree oil shampoos
5272 2018-07-29 19:11:25 อยู่ในจุดที่เอา Tea tree oil ที่เอาไว้แต้มสิวมาแต้มตุ่มยุงกัด(หรือตัวอะไรซักอย่างกัด) ฮือ คัน 
5273 2018-07-29 19:11:16 Thank you for your reply but as a vegan we can’t eat any animal based produce it would also rule out vegetarians if you ever do an oil option that would be great
5274 2018-07-29 19:11:08 Had a drop of cannabis oil. And woah.
5275 2018-07-29 19:11:00 You care less about the coast. Why, only a few lines up you were actively “lobbying” for Big Oil and #TMX with your nonsense that the alternative to the Trans Mountain will be an increased risk to orca, their habitat and their primary food supply.

That’s nonsense!
5276 2018-07-29 19:10:51 Looks good - esp. the eggs. 

My Italian  dish - yr hotel NY may like it : salt cod ( loin in salted water,6 hrs,changed 4-5 times ) cook in water, drain & flake,boiled sliced potato, red onion , parsley, capers: mix gently - dress in  olive oil, lemon, sea salt & crushed garlic
5277 2018-07-29 19:10:50 Roots oil on your mind as well
5278 2018-07-29 19:10:44 Before the discussion can begin. What Industrial processes were and are used to make Coconut Oil and darstad various Palm Oil > " edible" ?
5279 2018-07-29 19:10:24 We use CBD oil and her joint vitamins. She also uses light pain meds but I don’t want her on them so that’s why we are doing this 
5280 2018-07-29 19:10:24 I clean all my brushes and sponges with a lil bit of olive oil mixed with dish detergent. The oil helps remove the makeup and makes sure the brushes aren’t drying out while the detergent washes it out
5281 2018-07-29 19:10:24 I work at McDonald’s and the fries are cooked in a separate oil than anything else
5282 2018-07-29 19:10:21 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
5283 2018-07-29 19:10:18 Oil. He doesn't care about fighting in any country where he can't commit war crimes by stealing the oil.
5284 2018-07-29 19:10:16 Lol getting to review oil and now prerolls too???? ya im feeling that big dick energy now
5285 2018-07-29 19:10:13 I think good olive oil and fresh basil are usually sub for cheap oil and dried basil.
5286 2018-07-29 19:10:11 Oiling your cricket bat is the first step in the knocking in process. Using the Raw Linseed Oil found in your Bat Package lightly oil your new bat. Oiling – maintains moisture levels in bats and reduces the chances of splitting and cracking. Use a cloth to apply linseed oil!
5287 2018-07-29 19:10:06 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
5288 2018-07-29 19:09:56 Oh 100%. I’m being the biggest hypocrite, I’m still in bed now. But I also don’t need an oil change yet haha
5289 2018-07-29 19:09:39 niggas ain’t shit & the hoes ain’t loyal, really gon’ hate when they can’t destroy you
then expect the royal treatment
talkin slick like its oil speakin’
5290 2018-07-29 19:09:14 oof i just spent twice as much on an oil change and tire rotation than i could have at another place but 8-5 schedule :/
5291 2018-07-29 19:08:41 1 and 3/4 cups of flour, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup of dairy free yogurt, 1/4 cup oil, Himalayan salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, rosemary, nutritional yeast and 1 cup of zucchini. Bake for 35-40 minutes on 180. Keep an eye after 30 minutes.
5292 2018-07-29 19:08:41 I disagree there...Remember that not all types of oil are equal. There will be more demand for low sulfur WTI and consequently higher prices (and higher differentials compared to other types) down the road.
5293 2018-07-29 19:07:53 THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM who are MERELY the pawns of the presidents brother have been FIXING oil prices
5294 2018-07-29 19:07:52 US close Friday

5295 2018-07-29 19:07:51 next 6 months will be huge for  #RMP & #ANGS - 2 of my oil plays expecting huge returns in both this year. Both currently at low market caps so imo huge upside for both.
5296 2018-07-29 19:07:49 Mama said these hoes ain’t loyal, that’s why we never mixed like water with the oil
5297 2018-07-29 19:07:48 Mr BBQ is going to be pouring at Abbott's Grill & Bald Jason's Pub August 25th for the Midnight Oil Brewing Company Tap Takeover!  The takeover starts at 3pm so mark you calendars!
5298 2018-07-29 19:07:46 Also coconut oil! It works WONDERS.  Try taking some spare time to massage it onto your eyebrows for a couple of minutes! :)
5299 2018-07-29 19:07:31 bleh the sewage had dried and was all squelchy today. nothing was really salvageable but we got a few tins of food out
even the clothes we thought might have been alright were damp so it's not really worth it
also yeah the oil tank was pulled out of the ground so it's oil too
5300 2018-07-29 19:07:18 When oil and gas extraction (in an earth shaking/splitting violent way) is done to benefit the people, why are the pipelines mainly going to ports? To import expensive fuel for the people with double gain for the exporters/importers? Please read book by CELDF.
5301 2018-07-29 19:06:52 If you have acne issue, then you need to apply black seeds' oil. To rub will be harmful for you face. It will damage you skin tissues.
5302 2018-07-29 19:06:39 You know what sounds good after I just ate the sweetest Texas watermelon, some Triscuits with olive oil and cracked black pepper.
5303 2018-07-29 19:06:39 허어어
5304 2018-07-29 19:06:38 I use my cast iron for scrambled too. Let cool, dry the eggs out and the remnants come right out with salt and oil. Mostly because it’s easier to clean one pan than two. 
5305 2018-07-29 19:06:36 GAS at the pumps beat that was 2.00 Gal now 2.79 that's more than 4.1 % Look out citizens 50.% food & Items will raise. But oil companies WIL GET RICHER % RICHER.
5306 2018-07-29 19:06:10 I’m about to learn how to change my own oil  tired of paying for oil changes
5307 2018-07-29 19:06:02 1973 oil crisis
The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries proclaimed an oil embargo. 
Period: October 1973 – March 1974 It brought the us economy into a recession.
5308 2018-07-29 19:05:51 Wee bit of Danish Oil dripped in by mistake 
5309 2018-07-29 19:05:44 Take your care in for an oil change and magically everything possible wrong with ya car.

5311 2018-07-29 19:05:02 Coconut oil smell is everything
5312 2018-07-29 19:05:01 West: I should get up early tomorrow because I need an oil change. 

Also west: it’s now 3pm and he’s still not up
5313 2018-07-29 19:04:57 I love boy brow it’s amazing! I also have the jelly cleanser I’ve replaced like four times how much I love it. The body oil is amazing. Balm dot com is the one again I own like four ha. Priming moisturiser rich is great. Lid stars are nice for soft wash / ease
5314 2018-07-29 19:04:52 The moment lobbying from massive corporations is outlawed, such as:

NRA - guns
Exxon Mobile - oil
Pfizer - drugs
Lockheed Martin - war

is the moment we become the PEOPLE’s AMERICA.

There are 535 senators and reps meant for YOU but 12,719 lobbyists taking away from YOUR voice.
5315 2018-07-29 19:04:42 Oil ends lower as Russia hints at bigger-than-expected output boost
5316 2018-07-29 19:04:37 lavender oil helps with heal burns so i put some on the burns on my face but i HATE the smell of lavender and i can’t not smell it i wanna die
5317 2018-07-29 19:04:37 Prob for the best. I was underwhelmed. And even if a puff piece is as subtlety scathing as the NYT piece, it still brings a level of legitimacy to GP’s snake oil empire, and that is not okay.
5318 2018-07-29 19:04:23 ever since visiting the museum the other day i wanted to get into oil painting but it's...such a costy medium and i have a...plethora of unused art supplies and draw digitally the most anyway and man idk
5319 2018-07-29 19:04:23 How long before we kill these beautiful animals off? Animal Ag, Big Oil, & Frump r leading the reign of terror on our planet, the air, out water supplies, & all animals. Such gorgeous, graceful mammals!
5320 2018-07-29 19:04:15 Putin ordered Trump lift sanctions on Russia they will now pump oil tax free threw ukryand Crimea.  Thus Russia pays no taxes on oil threw pipeline.  Trump also is Putin’s entryway into Middle East Nuclear Power industry.  Trump is Russian Agent TRAITOR.  Traitor Russian Trump
5321 2018-07-29 19:04:14 I’m not a Pastor. Yet. But I love people. But this is the same thing liberals here are in the states. They are trying to make the discussion about one thing when the real issue has nothing to do with that. But thanks for visiting my page. :)
5322 2018-07-29 19:04:12 Wait, so olive oil is also bad ?
5323 2018-07-29 19:04:07 My new heavens rain the oil of glory all day everyday. Blessed are they who take refuge under my wings.
5324 2018-07-29 19:04:03 Please Get Real! You know the RepubliCONS are the War mongers! Stop the lies. Who started that fake war in Iraq? BUSH/Cheney RepubliCON Oil Cartel. Obama cleaned up Bush/Cheney World Financial disaster worst recession since the depression. That's history PAL!
5325 2018-07-29 19:04:01 He's actually telling the truth in respect to Surface Wilmar the cooking oil giant in Chitungwiza. Check your facts too
5326 2018-07-29 19:03:53 Did they force Americans to vote for trump or kill millions of innocent people around the world for oil and lies. Even hypocrisy has its limits and Americans need to realize that they are the villains in the world not Russia or China but the same people who bomb governments
5327 2018-07-29 19:03:43 Yam and oil #KnorrTasteQuest
5328 2018-07-29 19:03:34 On a side note,
(i) there is a layer of oil between us and the molten core.
(ii) people suck tremendous amounts of oil from the ground.

Question: If we suck all the oil out, what will happen to the molten core if it's burning oil to maintain it's temperature?
5329 2018-07-29 19:03:29 I need to go get my oil changed but I’m scared to go alone. I hate me
5330 2018-07-29 19:03:25 #ThisWeek in #USPolitics: @SenSchumer gives cover to red state democrats to vote for #Trump’s #SCOTUS pick; Congressional democrats approve #Trump’s further oil exploration on national parks lands; Cohen flips on the president, provides tapes. #TheResistance?
5331 2018-07-29 19:03:23 Trump never took anything from Putin.Yet expelled 60 diplomats. Shut down embassy in Seattle. Armed Ukraine in fight against RU. Killed 200 RU fighters in Syria.Trying to kill his EU oil deal. Screwing Iran .

Hillary/Obama took his money-sold him Uranium.  Who’s side are you on?
5332 2018-07-29 19:02:38 The problem is not foreign countries owning the oil companies, it's the fact that the revenues arising as a result, are not invested locally. 
So the country will never develop bcoz they're being robbed of their resources. #TrumpGang

5336 2018-07-29 19:01:52 Well, I'm not necessarily saying an *actual* *direct* war is good all around.  Frankly, I think that it would be 1914 again because it would impact global oil supplies and largely for China who might feel necessary to intervene.  But keeping people guessing and proxy wars....

5341 2018-07-29 19:01:18 Bad relations with allies, cancellations of sales of produce to foreign countries, sexual assaults of immigrant children separated from their parents, farmers at financial risk due to tariffs, rising oil prices, loss of health insurance for preexisting conditions...for starters.

5343 2018-07-29 19:00:56 The Trump administration is literally doing everything bad possible for this planet. They pulled us out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, taking over monuments and sacred lands, drilling for oil, etc, and now they are trying to roll back the Endangered Species Act.

5354 2018-07-29 18:59:35 Venezuela had a great oil revenue when Chavez was office output and oil prices were high, they could've stolen any amount. Chavez helped the  IRGC and Hezbollah to setup base in Venezuela, run drug smuggling operations and infiltrate Americas
5355 2018-07-29 18:59:28 Yup. Especially if they are in energy, oil, or land. Even boots with fancy dress suits.
5356 2018-07-29 18:59:25 I see soybean oil in a lot of products, and I wonder, what is it in there for? What does it do? It must cost "something" to include it, so why?

5369 2018-07-29 18:58:15 Well u didn’t help nation build Timor Este. You & Howard spied on them during  their oil negotiations then proceeded to rip off a small country on its financial knees. Nation builder you reckon ?

5380 2018-07-29 18:57:04 Can’t afford it. Scotland's money comes from oil. As soon as the shit hits the fan from Mueller's investigation the global price of oil's going to go spectacularly fucko and, if Scotland were independent @ that point, that would leave them in a very precarious economic position.
5381 2018-07-29 18:56:47 Jess made me Mac and Cheese with truffle oil and now we’re official on twitter.

5383 2018-07-29 18:56:37 Not to disparage Norway, but I think you're talking about the oil fund, which is set up to cover citizens' pensions. You're right, though: that is government working for its citizens. Plus, their starting wages and benefits are way better than in the US because unions.
5384 2018-07-29 18:56:27 Better or worse than insense? Essential oil diffusers?
5385 2018-07-29 18:56:27 Just monitor trends across global commodity & financial markets (LNG, oil, gas, gold, currencies, infrastructure finance) and the scope & detail of #Dedolarization Plan is in plain site. Yes, Mueller can get rid of Trump but the game to end US Dollar hegemony is well on its way.
5386 2018-07-29 18:56:23 Yes very much so. I even have tried the hemp oil it calms my period pain down tremendously and eases my mind however my insomnia is a different story.

5443 2018-07-29 18:45:25 What the link you shared cleverly does in defending the Oil Sands emissions is only consider their well-tank emissions. Not the roll the oil plays in the remaining 85% of Canada’s emissions from oil use for our energy.

5448 2018-07-29 18:44:54 This is an important place where clarity is important. The articles you linked refer to unemancipated minors marrying, not children. You’re right children should not marry. 17-year-olds are not children. This is a *very* important distinction—unless you’re trying to manipulate.
5449 2018-07-29 18:44:23 Actually the 513 million dollar investment was to protect the country and the world it originated from a 80 billion dollar bill that promoted using clean energy and stopping the dependence of oil from over seas. The wall on the other hand is just a wall that serves no purpose.

5473 2018-07-29 18:41:38 Stop calling him munafiki for God's sake,you don't know how much he has done,and I'm pretty sure they also know about the situation and are doing something, but we're saying what they're doing is not yielding result,they should do more, vis enlightening Nigerians what they're up2
5474 2018-07-29 18:41:34 In return? my guess..No active policy of US and/or China to try to push Kim Jong-un out of power. As China did try (the story goes) also recently. Lowering military activities? Notifying but allowing oil smuggling?
5475 2018-07-29 18:41:30 pro tip: when popping loose kernels, use chipotle infused olive oil to pop your kernels in. you'll get a little flavor heat on your popcorn
5476 2018-07-29 18:41:22 From the "little experience" I have concerning the sector, militant activities don't serve as a "major reason" oil installations in the ND aren't perfoming optimally...
But then, we are all entitled to our opinions. Hope your evening is going on well?
5477 2018-07-29 18:41:06 ha ha.. The irony. Big oil and their quest for profits are the very people who helped cause this mess, stifled and bought out alternative energy ideas, but are now charging/fining the public green taxes in their energy bills.

5483 2018-07-29 18:39:59 @michaelgove Mr Gove would be kind enough to explain why tankers have been cleared to dump palm oil in British Water until 2021.  Surely this is not a positive protection of oceans already in serious crisis.  Would you be able to justify such an agreement?
5484 2018-07-29 18:39:57 My boyfriend comes home tonight. I haven’t seen him since Wednesday morning. Obviously I’m completely hairless and soaked in oil and creams.
5485 2018-07-29 18:39:56 i have really dry skin, so i bought this oil thing you use in the morning and before bed, it’s only been two days and my face is so smooth and glowin like no other i’m so happy

5489 2018-07-29 18:39:29 The oil is exported, so it isn't improving things for Americans. ISIS is growing in Syria now if you bothered to research. GDP is no higher than it had been under Obama. Dems should run on correcting the outcome of an attack on the US resulting in a treasonous saboteur in our WH.
5490 2018-07-29 18:39:24 Yes. Butter & coconut oil.

5494 2018-07-29 18:38:10 Manufacturing hiring has ramped up in recent months, contributing to above trend employment growth in 2018. Most gains are due to the recovery in the oil and gas drilling sector and continued cyclical expansion.

5513 2018-07-29 18:35:56 Keep lobbying @BlairKing_ca !

The Trans Mountain is about shipping oil to Asia with 7X’s more oil tankers in the waters they live. Putting it on the ocean, instead of shipping it by the existing pipeline from the Sumas split to make up for declining Alaskan supply.
5514 2018-07-29 18:35:45 Till el-rufai says so....
El-rufai is definitely in the kitchen with oil to fry shehu sani steaming real hot on fire.
5515 2018-07-29 18:35:44 Not destroy the refinery. Disrupt the source of crude to the refinery. And yes, destructive activities in ND affect operations of all refineries (& some power generation facilities) in the country. Then throw-in poor maintenance. Btw, the katsina refinery wouldn’t be Govt owned

5528 2018-07-29 18:34:01 It's only confusing if you don't spend the time to do proper research. There is more than enough data to support climate change and how we are negatively affecting it. There is also lots of evidence that shows people who go against this scientific consensus are paid by big oil.

5531 2018-07-29 18:33:52 2-3 decades left for...  what?

Oil?  Naa, there are centuries worth of oil in the ground, and it can also be made synthetically, abit at a higher price.

Should we burn it all?  No, of course not, burning it is a terrible idea.  But we do have plenty of it.
5532 2018-07-29 18:33:52 See this is why I staunchly believe in minimalism. I HATE accumulating things and hoarding. I have been searching stores and the internet for a lemon scented facial moisturizer and a lemon hair oil. I already have one of the two.
5533 2018-07-29 18:33:45 It's!! Not actually they're two separate things but it looks like the oil+bacteria thing are both correct I think it's like a mixture between the two that are released into the air when it rains :o!! 
I don't think cut grass smell has a name weirdly enough I feel like it should

5577 2018-07-29 18:28:11 My tweet earlier was about the expenditures, so the paper I shared was in regards to how much energy is used to extract the oil. Having higher inputs, requires more to be burned to get a similar amount extracted. Hence, it is lower emission to ship it from SA.
5578 2018-07-29 18:27:54 There are also a LOT of reasons and as many different treatments for back pain.

5609 2018-07-29 18:22:38 I report any ad on my feed that promotes oil drilling and the coal industry because fuck y’all @Twitter should do better with the adds they promote
5610 2018-07-29 18:22:25 Uh._ is this oil meme going around
5611 2018-07-29 18:22:23 Incorrect. Assad has large factions who rely on him and vice versa. The West has oil and pipeline interests. Russia has long fought ISlamists
5612 2018-07-29 18:22:14 Fb mom groups are so overrated, this soon to be mom was posting how she’s going to take castor oil. She’s 37 weeks? Haha i said your baby is at risk if you do it. All I’m saying is moms need to do their own research for everything. W o w

5615 2018-07-29 18:21:32 I have been playing with my lower lip after bruising it. Today morning I applied  perfumed oil now it has furad and it's really painful 

What I am saying, is I won't be able to make it to the office.

5623 2018-07-29 18:20:55 So that oil tanker explosion just came and went like that?
5624 2018-07-29 18:20:49 Vrabel also did my taxes, changed my oil and taught me the power of friendship
5625 2018-07-29 18:20:48 I cook chicken breasts in olive oil with tons of red pepper flakes. Cook on low until the meat falls apart. Freeze in small amounts. Easy dinner is layered brown rice, black beans, cheese and salsa. Sometimes I buy or make tabouli, thaw some chicken, and top with feta cheese.
5626 2018-07-29 18:20:30 Not sure what your question is, but Ploesti is in Romania, which was a German ally in 1941. Oil fields weren’t under siege. Barbarossa aimed at no less than conquest of Russia.

5628 2018-07-29 18:20:17 3/n  Inflationary pressures as the 70s began were pushing inflation up to 3% (it had been many years ~1% ave).  Guns and butter fiscal policy of the 1960s had pushed inflation higher. Without the oil crisis it's unlikely that inflation would have risen nearly as high as it did.
5629 2018-07-29 18:20:06 Try putting tea tree oil on you before bed and if you don’t already, sleep with a fan on you. I hear they detect you from your breathe and the fan confuses them? Idk if that’s true though.
5630 2018-07-29 18:20:01 No one wants to debate you because most people see you as a clown, a joke, a snake oil salesmen, and with what is going on in your pernal life right now you are the nasty dog no one wants to touch
5631 2018-07-29 18:19:55 Good oil for my hair Is $10+ conditioners for my hair is $4+ good shampoo is 4+ Products for black/curly is a lot to maintain and keep healthy. You rarely see make up for dark skinned women in stores and when you do it’s expensive. Stop tearing black women down.

5639 2018-07-29 18:18:49 I think he wants you to avoid Palm oil too
5640 2018-07-29 18:18:44 Uhh no. He's not that stupid. Russia in fact was okay with the Iranian sanctions, which it seems to view are justified as a result of Iran making a deal with Obama, and made a killing of oil prices rising. Russia has also been warming to Israel.

5644 2018-07-29 18:17:47 But that would only shrink the WTI differential to Brent, doesn't shrink global oil supply or increase global oil demand so does not increase global oil prices.
5645 2018-07-29 18:17:23 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. James 5:14 ESV

5649 2018-07-29 18:16:14 Yes, Russia is nothing more than a 3rd world economy wholly dependent on selling oil.
5650 2018-07-29 18:15:31 African black soap + charcoal scrub mask + tea tree oil = clear skin heaven
5651 2018-07-29 18:15:27 It's true. China has the bulk of mineral rights there (thanks to USA assistance back in the day), and the mythological "oil pipeline" remained a myth (impossible to defend). There's no economic advantage for anyone there.
5652 2018-07-29 18:15:07 Why else would I be getting an oil rub?
5653 2018-07-29 18:15:00 I grabbed a new oil called California Cush it was pretty good but the watermelon one was really good shit had me lit
5654 2018-07-29 18:14:39 thinking out loud: less demand for heavy sour = no supply change because oil sands producers can't / won't ramp down (excess will be coked), but refineries will need more light sweet crude for more middle distillate = less light crude exported which = higher price for WTI. right?

5657 2018-07-29 18:14:27 Unknown to the broader public, Afghanistan has significant oil, natural gas and strategic raw material resources, not to mention opium, a multibillion dollar industry which feeds America’s illegal heroin market. We are there for the above - not for democracy or protect America!

5666 2018-07-29 18:13:19 Take that, mix in an equal amount of water and add essential oil to your liking, you have Fursuit spray.

I usually use alcohol first too, then peroxide and or iodine if needed. Haven't seen mercurochrome since the 70's.
5667 2018-07-29 18:13:07 Yes it definitely looks a richer  colour. I tend to only use Walnut oil and a warm hand to gently rub it into the stock

5677 2018-07-29 18:11:29 You are 100% right & I concur on your description of the “developmentalist Left”; I would still make the case that even within this LatAm context, AMLO is out of line with many local progressive & indigenous groups fighting development based on oil & hydros
5678 2018-07-29 18:11:20 Coconut oil is in general the best. It's amazing for chocolate ganache, too.
5679 2018-07-29 18:11:09 I think there is a very regional aspect to this. Anecdotally, truckers in Texas in the oil & gas patch are making a lot of money and are getting poached at truck stops . So, maybe wages are much higher in W. Texas but flat elsewhere?

5688 2018-07-29 18:09:32 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
5689 2018-07-29 18:09:22 How is that beneficial to those countries which produce such gas and oil products apart from conflicts and human sufferings and atrocities
5690 2018-07-29 18:09:14 Esok test Oil & Gas.. I need to sleep
5691 2018-07-29 18:09:11 Exxon rides free when they use taxpayer money to steal oil, stupid.  We can all ride free just like Exxon.
5692 2018-07-29 18:09:03 I argue that Trump is the front man (perhaps half-wittingly because he is so malleable and narcissistic) for the traditional Deep State of Oil-Defense-Wall Street against a faction that wanted to use a thaw with Iran to curtail the Saudis and cut Russia out of the Middle East.
5693 2018-07-29 18:08:41 I will see, but so far my skin is extremely oily. Like I put eye primer on my lids not to protect makeup, but to absorb oil so it doesn't get into my eyes at the end of the day and burn. I would love it if my skin dried out.
5694 2018-07-29 18:08:36 Ryan - several species of scale attack maples - small, leave a whitish exudate behind - so could be.  If you can spare a twig or two - cut and take to a GOOD arborist. If scale, good oil spray treatment should help
5695 2018-07-29 18:08:35 You just mentioned oil...! Don't confuse readers.
5696 2018-07-29 18:08:07 I actually do work at Burger King. We do not use fish oil. We use an oil that is a mixture of corn, soybean, and canola oil. We also do in fact use separate fryers for fries and fries only.

5700 2018-07-29 18:07:33 I just gune rutin biasa. Oil cleanser, cleanser, toner, mosturizer, sunblock and mask. 
5701 2018-07-29 18:07:19 good point. i stand corrected. you just earned a supporter of nuclear. however, putting oil companies out of business is still priority number one.

Becky Smith you have won a CBD Balm Sativa (30ml) RRP: £29.99
Make sure to message us to arrange delivering you this weeks prize!
Well done, Cheds Team
5704 2018-07-29 18:07:10 I hate it when that happens!!  If you have other kinds of oil around, coconut oil can help dilute it so the pain goes away faster, in the future! But hopefully there won’t be a next time.  Feel better soon!
5705 2018-07-29 18:07:04 I don’t use a toner in this skin care regiment I’m on. I have in the past, but as of now I just use Raw Black Soap in combination with my Clinique Brush, Raw Shea Moisture with 2 drops of pure tea tree oil. Every three days I use the Shea Moisture clarifying face mask.
5706 2018-07-29 18:07:02 Shoutout to the guy at O’Reilly’s for not making fun of me for having no idea what kind of oil my car needs 
5707 2018-07-29 18:06:54 It’s the oil pulled out of marijuana without the thc completely legal. Stopped my anxiety and so many other things.
5708 2018-07-29 18:06:42 AKA, how a GOP shill obscures the horrors of mass shootings with gobbledegook statistical cherry picking and pseudoscience.

Your bad use of biased statistics is well noted by anyone who knows anything about this subject. Please go peddle your snake oil elsewhere.

5711 2018-07-29 18:06:12 If the US is producing oil at its highest rate ever where’s the gap causing oil to stay high????
5712 2018-07-29 18:06:02 Thanks for the heads up! Yeah where we live has a lot of trees and hills and bugs. I got a diffuser and some citronella oil to leave in my bedroom since that’s where I think they’ve been getting me.
5713 2018-07-29 18:06:02 Big Oil. The Defense Industry. Wall Street. Major $$$ beneficiaries. Operationally,  ... the UAE (Mohammed bin Zayed), the Bin Salman faction of the Saudis, Bibi and Putin ... the nexus being a trade of Syria for Iran and, as a nice twofer, the near doubling of the price of oil.
5714 2018-07-29 18:05:51 ... and in fact if we're starting history with Mossadegh, I'd say the Brits (by way of the Anglo-Persion Oil Company) probably still deserve a share of the credit / blame.
5715 2018-07-29 18:05:47 Easier for me to just buy pot. I get weak and strong batches here and there. CBD oil id have to travel for and too costly. Bad enough I have to rely on this method. At least I dont have to look in dangerous places anymore. I cant handle pharmas. Gets me sick.
5716 2018-07-29 18:05:00 fresh seafood and a check just for living there due to all the oil drilling but dassit
5717 2018-07-29 18:04:59 Good luck finding a leader who can lead a 150 different ethnic groups. What happened to Gaddafi's gold and who is buying Libyan oil if there is no centralized government/leadership? How active is ISIS in Libya? The West created this situation, just like in Iraq & Afghanistan.
5718 2018-07-29 18:04:52 No, but I'm pretty sure they had snake oil salesmen.
5719 2018-07-29 18:04:51 What happened after the muslim attack on this country? It shut the country down completely. Clinton sold us out free trade agreement, bushes oil, obummer, muslim, god hating rioting, racism, and you voted for the antichrist. Did not vote clinton bush or bummer.

5723 2018-07-29 18:04:11 Driven an oil well service truck like the crane truck in Terminator3. Would've never given chase to a Toyota Tundra.
5724 2018-07-29 18:04:10 Fighting corruption does not necessarily means corrupt practices  has stopped. Malabu oil deal comes to mind. While nigeria judges does not see anything wrong,foreigners dt partipated are being prosecuted & sentenced in their counties......
5725 2018-07-29 18:04:10 Sorry I don't think that is brilliant at all, its old hat for preachers & snake oil salesmen. Pick out a fear(s), make the gullible believe only you can save them. The Boogie Man gonna get you! The ignorance of his audience makes it easy peasy. Plus Fox News of course.
5726 2018-07-29 18:04:09 Why do you think it's a bluff?

People seem to thing the US needs Canadian trade equally to how Canada needs US trade. 

The US used to need our oil and gas for security reasons.  They don't anymore.  

We are back to the trade dynamics we had before the OPEC crisis
5727 2018-07-29 18:03:41 If capitalist farmers and oil barons really believe the nonsense that they, you know, profess, why don't they just refuse to accept taxpayer funded bailouts?
5728 2018-07-29 18:03:24 My most polite #4letterword #barf!  Even people working in the oil and gas industry don't want this!
5729 2018-07-29 18:03:19 Congrats on your first wally Rachel so so very very happy and proud of ya 
5730 2018-07-29 18:03:19 The Oil wealth you people have collected from CRS is not just enough abi! Don't worry we will give you even unical, Tinapa and our governor self. Before now, calabar airport use to be very busy until AKS built theirs. CRS will gain back her glory! Leave us alone mbok.

5733 2018-07-29 18:02:50 Do you have 212 sexy men perfume oil?
5734 2018-07-29 18:02:35 It is possible to be supportive of our current economy while at the same time advocating for diversification and shift toward renewables for less dependancy on oil. They aren’t mutually exclusive.
5735 2018-07-29 18:02:30 Reminder if you use products with palm oil you’re supporting the destruction of rainforests and the extinction of chimpanzees and Sumatran  Tigers! Be better!
5736 2018-07-29 18:02:25 I went in for an oil change & i ended up having a flat tire and wow um i dont want a car anymore
5737 2018-07-29 18:02:11 Try coconut oil apparently it’s a repellent
5738 2018-07-29 18:02:02 Then why support politians who support oil and gas while putting tarrifs on materials for solar, costing jobs and the advancement of the solar industry?
5739 2018-07-29 18:02:00 Entah nder gue blm pernah pake bio oil. Pke kleveru pun b aja ga begitu banyak perubahan ;/
5740 2018-07-29 18:01:57 And finally, at the same date, there was also oil in kribi, logbaba, Edea, far north.  gold and iron  in the east, bauxite, nickel,etc
5741 2018-07-29 18:01:51 I prefer to sit on the fence. Watch the world through the eyeholes in my oil paintings.
5742 2018-07-29 18:01:41 Mannnn that nigga took that fish from the package straight to the oil!!
5743 2018-07-29 18:01:40 Sue gave a speech at Roxxon Oil one time, so handing the country over to the Hate-Monger and VP MODOK was the obvious alternative!
5744 2018-07-29 18:01:40 Creative design and printing is my oil well.
5745 2018-07-29 18:01:37 There are downsides to both options, but i believe developing the areas where the oil is being drilled will go a long way compared to giving it to those who need it (e.g the poor) & not developing these areas.

SO, the London Tory Gov't have decided to keep the TRUTH of brexit disaster from the people.

They have practice, they kept their robbery of £1Trillion from Scotland's Oil revenue
5764 2018-07-29 17:57:42 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5765 2018-07-29 17:57:32 No one should be surprised @ US role in Saudi blockade and Yemeni civil war. Trading US military protection for oil is deep in the roots of Saudi-US relations. Biggest arms sale in US history was brokered under Barack Obama - a cool $60 billion

5770 2018-07-29 17:57:00 Kalabari kingdom is under develop were as we are an oil producing kingdom, its imperative to inform the federal and state government of our stand and what might happen soonest.
5771 2018-07-29 17:56:49 Did you know that the population explosion in Houston normally associated with oil was actually due to the wide proliferation of air conditioning?
5772 2018-07-29 17:56:46 Bro your argument is more like saying the reason oil companies HQ is not located in the south/south is because the state governments are not doing enough. U have to understand the script of what is happening in this country.
5773 2018-07-29 17:56:32 In the past 12 months alone, crude oil prices are up 50 per cent, supported by supply cuts from major oil producing countries.

Though petrol and diesel prices in the country are determined by markt, the government still providing subsidy for kerosene and cooking gas.
5774 2018-07-29 17:56:30 Nice to look at our squad and think we arguably have the strongest squad we've had since we last won the league, if it wasn't for City and their unlimited oil money, we'd be the fucking favourites.
5775 2018-07-29 17:55:58 You're supporting him to build a ranch in your state while he is about to build an oil refinery in Katsina.

Rising crude oil prices are putting pressure on the rupee as India imports more than 80 per cent of its crude oil requirement.
5778 2018-07-29 17:55:47 That's because your opinion was prolly stupid,then you'll be reminded of your past,how many ppl were helped on this street and weren't referred back to it.

5780 2018-07-29 17:55:42 If that’s true, then let’s lower gas prices by ending subsidies to the oil industry.

5785 2018-07-29 17:55:05 What exactly does that do? Does it work like scented oil or something?

5791 2018-07-29 17:54:08 Everyone asking why it's a lighter color: It says LIGHT olive oil right on it. Have you guys never seen light olive oil before?
5792 2018-07-29 17:54:06 I needed an oil change so bad this is embarrassing 
5793 2018-07-29 17:53:38 2/n Yes, inflation was caused by increasing the money supply even more than before.  But the reason for the increase of money was the supply shock in oil combined with a policy of trying to maintain "full" employment.

5797 2018-07-29 17:53:03 It’s a sign, perhaps a hint or even our collective expression at the sudden realisation that we’re all being ripped off again. I think it’s time to block the oil refineries again and bring the country to a halt. Funny how fuel prices go up astronomically, yet never drop by same!!
5798 2018-07-29 17:52:52 I get so much anxiety watching my mechanic do my oil change while smoking cigs 
5799 2018-07-29 17:52:46 We're not supposed to say the Brexiters are lacking perception but what do you call people taken in by a smooth talking Tory Snake Oil salesman?
5800 2018-07-29 17:52:37 음음음
5801 2018-07-29 17:52:31 Check the odometer and be sure to get an oil change every 3,000 miles.
5802 2018-07-29 17:52:20 Have you tried a lavender essential oil inhaler?

Whenever I feel my anxiety start acting up, I wave it around me/smell it and it lets me get those deep breathes that are hard to fight for in those situations. 

Just remember it will pass, sending good vibes your way 
5803 2018-07-29 17:52:18 Forgot how annoying the scabbing period is with new tattoos. God bless coconut oil.
5804 2018-07-29 17:52:17 So I bought what I thought was topcoat for my nails and it turns out it’s oil. Wow I am so pissed. I just wasted so much time trying to put this on kanti it’s oil.
5805 2018-07-29 17:52:07 Oil changes are so over priced.
5806 2018-07-29 17:51:53 Exactly right (perhaps a quart of water will do if you eat fruit...) and for the outside: baking soda, vinegar and coconut oil.
5807 2018-07-29 17:51:35 i got peppermint oil in my eye and it burns

5810 2018-07-29 17:50:49 The 4th pic though 
5811 2018-07-29 17:50:36 Oil? No use Shea Butter!
5812 2018-07-29 17:50:16 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
5813 2018-07-29 17:50:08 Yes but the US budget income is only 3 trillion compared to the US GDP as a whole 16 trillion. And that 3 million comes from taxes too. Where in Libya its budget = its GDP (now budget x1.5 GDP per annum) since everyone is dependent on oil. Its not a fair comparison diff situation
5814 2018-07-29 17:50:04 I can see this becoming a meme. Calling all EV drivers. Go and do a selfie of you giving the oil companies the middle finger and share on social media.
5815 2018-07-29 17:50:01 He' still around claiming to be a millionaire or whatever. Damn snake oil salesman.
5816 2018-07-29 17:49:59 This is the most inaccurate propaganda call I've seen
Benue and Jos do not produce oil too 
But they had their time in the news 
All this propaganda has to stop 
You people are not doing enough to publicize it
The state have staunch supporters of buhari

If the loss of power to the oil barons from decentralised renewable energy production is unpalatable they need to understand that dead is a whole lot less palatable. Venus, coming to a world near you
5820 2018-07-29 17:49:21 It could also be that too many politicians benefit from oil companies- stop that and see how they vote....just as a scientific experiment perhaps?
5821 2018-07-29 17:49:18 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
5822 2018-07-29 17:49:16  I wonder if i combine these two i can get a little help. I bet I'll have to help with truck oil change.

5826 2018-07-29 17:48:33 He doesn't care.  It is "intentional language" from the greatest of all "snake oil salesmen" May God have mercy on his soul.
5827 2018-07-29 17:48:24 That's my point, why would a refinery be cited in kaduna, spending billions to transport oil
5828 2018-07-29 17:48:08 Such inaction helps explain why communities across the nation are
considering bans to fracking-enabled oil and gas development."
You're saying that if regulators took public health seriously, communities would stop considering bans.
5829 2018-07-29 17:47:54 I put apple cider vinegar (organic) and put peppermint oil in it.
5830 2018-07-29 17:47:54 so I use the kukui nut oil shampoo and conditioner which are specifically made for frizzy hair, and I can say they're really good. they're the black bottles. but I suggest you go with their hydration coconut water range which has shampoo, conditioner and serum too, for a start
5831 2018-07-29 17:47:42 Premium is 3.19 now someone buy me an oil field
5832 2018-07-29 17:47:30 They’re pointing out that before they were in power they were protesting oil. Now they are supporters of it. In my opinion I think it’s great that more people are coming around to the fact that oil is a major industry in our province and that it’s not the boogeyman.
5833 2018-07-29 17:47:11 Which kind of country is this?  Upon all the oil wealth, they are still taking the last position
5834 2018-07-29 17:47:01 Can I know Amazing herbs black seed oil is halal or not? I need to enaure that before I buy it
5835 2018-07-29 17:46:59 It will be the next thing after crude oil. Huge money
5836 2018-07-29 17:46:43 Maybe he was making a hyperspecific point about how coconut oil is basic and the only appropriate feminist moisturizer is shea butter-based

5840 2018-07-29 17:45:49 Given your complete lack of literacy I doubt very much you are reading a book. 

You are aware Venezuela has a corrupt government, sanctions and an economy collapsed because of over dependence on oil.
5841 2018-07-29 17:45:40 Maybe the chikins live in an organic environment. Only eat organic feed, drink mineral water with 9.5pH, are cooked with olive oil, are served in an organic restaurant. 
5842 2018-07-29 17:45:37 I've said this was about oil and drilling in the Arctic (and other places) from day one. That's why they want climate change, melt the ice caps to get big drilling ships/equipment through. Rex Tillerson got a "Friendship Award" from Putin, so there's that...
5843 2018-07-29 17:45:31 if the far right are the only people interested in protecting children, then I guess I’m Hitler
5844 2018-07-29 17:45:30 That is what I was going to suggest too. Wash the area under the hottest water you can stand with Fels Naptha bar soap. It is cheap and you can find it near laundry soaps. Cuts the oil really well.
5845 2018-07-29 17:45:29 Love simply going to get my oil changed and finding out there’s something wrong it’s so great!!
5846 2018-07-29 17:45:15 I diy'd a press and make my own. Higher quality oil, saves money . Pretty sure the CVS junk is at least 20% skink, tbh.
5847 2018-07-29 17:45:14 My point is that your statement is false and contributing to a wrong interpretation of the history of this country. From what I understand of you, you  should know better.
I am stating that both parts of the country benefitted from Cameroon as a whole. Oil came only in 1977.
5848 2018-07-29 17:45:08 Well only got 5 and a half hours of sleep got to get the oil changed in car and help my roomie move in have a great day
5849 2018-07-29 17:45:02 Mine used to be more oily, I had to be careful of oils. Tamanu oil is a crazy good dry oil fyi.
5850 2018-07-29 17:44:46 We are more focused on quick money. Spending billions on oil exploration so the north can be oil producing too! Yet God has blessed the north with every other thing, but no what we want is oyel! See what greed is causing us and the leaders are nowhere to be found.

5853 2018-07-29 17:44:09 The consumer loses as we grow corn to water down fuel, we might as well turn oil into food if it can benefit a small group of people.
5854 2018-07-29 17:44:07 people love referencing venezuela’s economic woes as evidence that socialism “doesn’t work” as if the country hasn’t been a victim of US aggression for years, namely its continuous attempts at destabilizing their government and sanctions on the oil their economy depends on...
5855 2018-07-29 17:44:06 Not to mention “Oil & Gold” and the majestic “Nemesis”! It felt earth changing at the time 
5856 2018-07-29 17:43:55 In the USA all the media networks are sponsored by Pharmaceutical Companies peddling Rx Drugs, pills with side effects that include Suicide, Hallucinations and Psychosis.. surely the Scottish Cannabis Oil company is far far safer option. Good for them! Hope USA follows suit

5874 2018-07-29 17:40:03 Olive oil & avocado oil are considered fruit oils => so thumbs up but the caveat being they have to be pure oil & avocado oil.

5884 2018-07-29 17:38:51 Sorry. I am about to call you out on bad faith. This is what you said: " Since 1961.... while their resources (more than 95% of Cameroon oil) used to benefit only francophone side".
My question what were the ressources of the state between 1961 and 1977 ?
5885 2018-07-29 17:38:42 Yes so true the next action or reaction by #Trump and his administration can and will cause global oil crisis. As always we the common people will suffer and will have to bear the price hike
5886 2018-07-29 17:38:32 Blocking gas pipelines could also cause gas plants to use oil (jet fuel).

5889 2018-07-29 17:38:14 The rights are there if you give your life and time to serving corporate interests. Why aren’t you happy? Sell your soul for $, you’ll be so happy with a flat screen TV while you don’t look at Big Oil waging an infinite war “against terror” or “drugs”

5895 2018-07-29 17:37:16  maybe I need to marry a 90yo oil tycoon who don't pays much attention while I draw my gays
5896 2018-07-29 17:37:12 You portray a disagreement about tactics and strategy (not science) as right/wrong and therefore an either/or choice. We disagree. We think that pursuing rules helps people living with oil and gas now. You don’t. We’re back where we started.

5903 2018-07-29 17:35:26 The 1st reference followed a list of conclusions Earthworks had drawn from data you'd collected. 1) contaminants that are associated with oil & gas development are present in air & water in areas where residents are experiencing health symptoms consistent with such exposures;
5904 2018-07-29 17:35:23 A mini thread. Nigerians believe Nigeria is so rich, but never contextualizing d wealth. Assuming d cost of crude oil productn is Zero, thus crude oil revenue = profit, then, let us to the arithmetic. 2mbp X $80 = $160m/day. Now the pop. est. is 197m. That is 82 cent/citizen/day.

5908 2018-07-29 17:35:04 Coconut oil!!!

I put a lot of coconut oil in my hair, leave it for 30 minutes. Then wash it out and it leaves my hair nice and smooth. Sometimes i even put a bit of it at the bottom of my hair ro give it some shine and not look dry. Just avoid the roots so it doesnt look oily!
5909 2018-07-29 17:35:02 I suppose the more general answer is nobody’s at the wheel.

Individual oligarchs push in diff. directions but nobody agrees on which fixes are best because their interests differ eg pharma wealth would hate single payer or oil hates new energy, and we end up with nothing fixed
5910 2018-07-29 17:35:00 @RawBeautyKristi I suffer from debilitating stress migraines that last weeks. (I have PTSD and ASD, among other shit... long story.) CBD oil makes my migraines bloom and balloon out of control as well. THC truly helps me, because it makes me sleep!

5912 2018-07-29 17:34:40 I've smoked all day,  every day, for b like 12 years and just 10mg will knock me out,  so I don't think it's because of tolerance. I'd definitely try eating more or making it with stronger stuff like oil/extracts (if you haven't already)
5913 2018-07-29 17:34:30 For crying out LOUD Britain! These foreign powers aren’t fiddling your politics for fun. UK is being trussed & fattened for the biggest asset strip of the 21stC so far.

5918 2018-07-29 17:33:39 Solar power is the best option because it is 10X cheaper than anything else. Autonomous Electric Vehicles will replace individual vehicle ownership and drop oil demand to a price point were only oil below $25 US production cost will be viable.
5919 2018-07-29 17:33:37 This sounds really weird, but I take Catnip Oil every night while on my period. It reduces my hospital-level cramps to barely there, helps me sleep, and keeps my hormonal anxiety to manageable levels. :)
5920 2018-07-29 17:33:35 Thanks to all for your efforts. Now do we need to get oil out of the ground faster in retrospect?

5934 2018-07-29 17:32:09 Sandra, you are acting the moral scold in transferring your justified certainty about the science of oil and gas production to the strategies and and tactics one should and must pursue to protect communities and environment from their negative impacts.

5939 2018-07-29 17:31:56 Shell have come to EV world rather late. What they need to realise is while they may be a big cheese in oil, they aren't even the cracker in charging.
5940 2018-07-29 17:31:22 It will be interesting to see what the oil price will be after that.
5941 2018-07-29 17:31:04 No. not every country has a free oil cash pot where useless people get to stay in power indefinitely NO MATTER how disconnected from reality and real solutions to problems they are.

5960 2018-07-29 17:28:36 It is possible to agree with one or two Trump policy decisions and NOT be a Trump supporter - just as I agreed with many of Obama's policy decisions and was NOT an Obama supporter.  Drilling in national parks aside - investment in domestic oil is a smart move.

5968 2018-07-29 17:27:20 But everyone should be aware that among it's many uses it's used to extract vegetable oil from vegetables (like soy oil from soy beans). So I suspect health problems from it usage is probably site specific handling or storage procedures.
5969 2018-07-29 17:27:10 Coconut oil is equally effective. And I just bought Vaseline last week. It is all sorts of awesome for all rashes, dryness etc.

5988 2018-07-29 17:22:48 He did far more that close it - he expelled 60 diplomats.
Also you didn’t disagree that he told the Germans to abandon the oil pipeline from Russia. Bottom line- Trump is tougher on Russia than Obama or Hilary would have been
5989 2018-07-29 17:22:43 Then they turn around and buy oil and natural gas from Russia.

6019 2018-07-29 17:16:59 Here is something that I have been thinking about. Justin wants Canada to be a Globalist Country. He is purposefully ruining the economy to do so. He won’t build pipelines until the Globalists have taken over Canada. They will use OUR oil to fund Globalism. Evil.

6025 2018-07-29 17:16:15 Abacha  reawarded it to Julius Berger with full payment with oil block via B+B Oil&Gas Ltd. Obasanjo revoked it& concessioned to Global Infrastructure along with DSC&NIOMCO Itakpe.Yaradua revoked it&re-engage JB,GEJ handed back to Global/AMCON who did nothing.Then came PMB!
6026 2018-07-29 17:16:03 I'm sure all the trolls will point to socialism as the be all answer. Instead of acuallybloiking at the real problem we created for them with sanctions. Why? They have the largest oil reserve in the world. Look that up.

6032 2018-07-29 17:15:37 Medicine helps but if you would like to try natural remedies you can use 100% peppermint essential oil. Hope your migraine gets better sister James 
6033 2018-07-29 17:15:31 You’ve gotta come through West Texas (Odessa) When the oil is booming the way it is now, unfortunately we see or hear of TONS of crashes and fatalities. It’s sad . #SlowDown

6046 2018-07-29 17:13:18 I’m getting an oil change and the broseph next to me pulled up in a tricked out Honda Civic and the crew is straight up clowning on the fella. 
6047 2018-07-29 17:13:18 “Views you disagree with” are not same as what Jones does. He disgustingly discounted violent slaughter of kids in school as a false flag operation. He makes up false health claims to hock crazy prepper supplies to paranoid ppl. This is fake news & snake oil salesmanship fraud

6058 2018-07-29 17:11:49 More like the defection of political party members is more of a concern to the authorities as well as the media than the killing of innocent lives.

6069 2018-07-29 17:10:15 It amazes how some self-proclaimed "fiscally conservative" #akleg R's aren't when it comes to oil co's. Cut Medicaid? Yep. But borrow $1B & kick the costs down the road b/c some oil co's want paid off early? Sure. SMH. AK needs CONSISTENT fiscal responsibility, not occasional.

6079 2018-07-29 17:08:39 Anything oily like vegetable oil or Goo- gone. Available at a hardware store
6080 2018-07-29 17:08:38 Yeah this

It's been about oil and energy all along.
6081 2018-07-29 17:08:33 Have you read The Prize by Daniel Yergin? Includes a very good account of the development and break up of Standard Oil.
6082 2018-07-29 17:08:32 The Oil Money Team
6083 2018-07-29 17:08:23 I love the lore that West Texas has to it like it’s just a lawless wasteland full of hookers, cocaine, and oil. 

I mean, it’s not wrong... but it still sounds like the backdrop to a Louis L’Amour novel.
6084 2018-07-29 17:08:13 Presidents don’t control the prices of gas. You give trump that much credit that gas has increased, what 30 cents a gallon in 18 months? What policies has trump invoked that have contributed to oil price increases. (I trade oil on the open exchange, this is a trick question)
6085 2018-07-29 17:08:11 Yeah, but that old, dirty oil. Basically, generic, but so dangerous for your car.
6086 2018-07-29 17:08:09 It’s summer time and we are all headed to the beach. One of my favorite things to take to the beach is my body glitter. It’s shines so nice in the sun. I don’t wear just any body glitter it has to be protective for my skin. I have purchased coconut oil based body glitter.
6087 2018-07-29 17:08:02 Light skin girls be like “oh you were called a gorilla looking black bitch & car oil spill? well I was called a Cinnamon toast cereal. We BOTH experienced colorism ”
6088 2018-07-29 17:07:51 By law Mass requires a balanced budget. Ask citizens where they want their tax $ to go. They’ll say where it will do the best to help the average person, HC, schools, infrastructure. The Republicans are phasing all that out but still subsidizing private R&D, oil exploration...
6089 2018-07-29 17:07:49 Stop buying into the rich only tax cuts. Most saw some money just the rich pay a lot. No benefits have been cut. Gas prices are up b/c economy is moving so supply & demand. OPEC is also strangling oil production for better prices per barrel.
6090 2018-07-29 17:07:29 I hope it’s state level because with this administration and anti-environment stance you might as well petition it to open for oil drilling.
6091 2018-07-29 17:07:20 Husband likes smoked oysters. Can I grabbed had COTTONSEED OIL. Yuck!
6092 2018-07-29 17:07:01 Ohh that sounds great! I'll try that next week. And probably refreshing with the lemon essential oil  I like me some lemon  thank you so much 
6093 2018-07-29 17:06:59 Not even close to being snake oil salesman
6094 2018-07-29 17:06:57 More like, the mainstream media as well as its influencing factor determines who we show sympathy due to the choice of news they share, how it's shared and when it's shared, especially when some particular religious or ethnic sects are involved. 

Just saddening.
6095 2018-07-29 17:06:46 Lol I tried a sample of some peppermint oil because they were like, "it's soothing, opens up your nose, etc" so sure....then rubbed my eye.... mistake

6097 2018-07-29 17:06:32 The behaviors they have based the program on lack any scientific validity.  The remaining question is if they purchased this snake oil, or mixed it up themselves.
6098 2018-07-29 17:06:27 killing animals is eliminating an important part of the resources to survive, more than oil and those things.
even animals that consume animals would also be in danger of extinction, that generates a chain reaction that would lead to the extinction of all life on a planet.
6099 2018-07-29 17:06:13 But embargoes are still on right? Like Russian Lumber and Palm Oil?
6100 2018-07-29 17:06:12 Oil
6101 2018-07-29 17:06:02 Interesting thought......when were those times exactly? If my history is correct, Hoover & FDR pushed us further into the Great Depression & Obama just floundered for 8 yrs. So do tell......Carter kept us in one w/ an oil embargo.......what else?
6102 2018-07-29 17:06:01 Yep - HE is full of Snake Oil!

I think that #LearningAnalytics and #BigData would be a good topic to have a #LTHEchat #HEAchat session on, give people a chance to hear of any good experiences out there and the theory & politics of it all - could a @Jisc expert do 6Qs? @LTHEchat
6103 2018-07-29 17:05:58 PAN? [twists his head back and forth, considering] OIL.
6104 2018-07-29 17:05:50 I am saying we could do much better, and that there is another way besides throwing subsidies to big oil, giving them enormous corp and personal tax breaks and then saying we can't afford to do better.
6105 2018-07-29 17:05:47 "autolyzed yeast extract" also code for MSG as contains glutamate with sodium salt added) so is like saying MSGx2.  Also note even though says 0 g transfat is a lie as "partially hydrogenated oil" in there, they can hide up to 0.5 g & still put 0 on label. Stop eating poison!
6106 2018-07-29 17:05:41 Saw a gritter coming back into Richmond from possibly A1 at about 3.00pm. Thought maybe a film of deisel oil on roads after the long dry spell.

6120 2018-07-29 17:02:17 They certainly are. Just need to cut them in half now drizzle with EVO Oil and top with green and purple basil.
6121 2018-07-29 17:02:08 Some of us are interested in knowing how this particular snake oil works out 
6122 2018-07-29 17:02:01 Do you think oil revenue should go to those who need it the most (e.g poor children), or to the geographical location where the oil is drilled?
6123 2018-07-29 17:01:53 TLの9割追えてないので気にならんよ
6124 2018-07-29 17:01:49 If they can manage that, it would certainly be out-of-box thinking but I fear time is a factor here. Hope oil prices don't increase - that could make all this graver.
6125 2018-07-29 17:01:41 Ah. So u no fit talk anointing oil?

6158 2018-07-29 16:59:21 Unfortunately your friend, just like the rest of trumps followers, are going to get hit with a large dose of reality.  Trump talks.  A lot.  He’s a master manipulator and no different than a snake oil salesman.  He’s a fraud.
6159 2018-07-29 16:59:14 I have pureed black beans and used them instead of oil or butter in brownies. They made the brownies moist

6165 2018-07-29 16:58:39 The greater irony is the numerous currently in power ndp ministers advocating to stop the “tar sands” and any pipeline. Now they have some power it’s let’s build the pipelines so our “oil sands” can flourish.
6166 2018-07-29 16:58:26 not democratic socialism. Plus we gave the morons in the country the past two years and all they've done is fuck up royally. Democratic Socialism is for people who want their tax dollars spent on them and their kids not subsidizing big oil or weapons, simple.
6167 2018-07-29 16:58:09 Get specific. Where do you live? Someplace that's extracting oil, gas or both? I grew up within 25 miles of the mill in this video. To answer your question, the late 70s, early 80s. I went west at age 20 to work in the oil and gas fields. Tell us exactly where your mill is

6174 2018-07-29 16:57:00 I don't think Kenney speaks to the oil industry itself, which is by necessity realistic,  but to the segment of Albertans who cling to the illusion of an imaginary oil industry purveyor of endless wealth and prosperity. #abpoli
6175 2018-07-29 16:56:57 I hate waiting on my oil to be changed 
6176 2018-07-29 16:56:33 Ante la volatilidad del crudo y su posible vuelta en el futuro a unos niveles de precios bajos, los productores se han dado cuenta de que en vez de exportar el oil crudo es mucho mejor procesarlo ellos mismos,apropiándose de un mayor valor añadido dentro de la value chain del oil
6177 2018-07-29 16:56:26 James 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
6178 2018-07-29 16:56:25 no. their negative CO2 would not have been greater, because demand would have kept up with supply. you cannot reduce CO2 production without shutting down oil companies. in that sense, Germany is ahead in that they have demonstrate a willingness to shut down energy corps.

6180 2018-07-29 16:56:00 I know most the East Coast so called elites don’t have automobiles but if your car is leaking oil you don’t keep pouring oil into it till you fix the leak Build The Damn Wall!

6184 2018-07-29 16:55:27 Somebody should write an article with things Puget Sound homeowners can do right now to help. Stop using ALL pesticides, stop putting moss killing things on your roof, make sure your car doesn't leak oil, don't cut down trees along streams, etc.
6185 2018-07-29 16:55:05 Coconut oil is supposed to be good for a lot of things!
6186 2018-07-29 16:55:01 Not to mention there is no stats on weed vs violence. None real anyway. Big pharma and the oil companies lobbied to ban cannabis early last century. Reason?

6189 2018-07-29 16:54:55 How is a pipeline rising emissions? Most oil is being transported by rail. By older locomotives that are running a Tier 1 or Tier 2 emissions standard. Oil is still being moved to a harbour then shipped. But it is not being moved efficiently. And I mentioned world pollution.

Jay and Dash named their company after him as a way to aspire to also be rich but...

6204 2018-07-29 16:53:12 to Europe have been. These people are just an additional expense for the productive natives. In relation to integration, this is a myth. We see that the descending population of immigrants from decades ago did not integrate. Be it Muslims and Africans in the UK, Turks in Germany,
6205 2018-07-29 16:53:11 Russo brothers have clarified it recently. If I understand it correctly, he only reduced "living resources", so the amount of coal, oil or plutonium etc. remained the same.

6208 2018-07-29 16:52:57 It will not be your population any more anyway. Also, if you are thinking of importing people to help with pensions, you really have to certify that the people entering your country are skilled workers and not net negatives in the finances of the states as third world immigrants
6209 2018-07-29 16:52:53 I think that LA might be snake oil masquerading as fairy dust though.
6210 2018-07-29 16:52:45 Also I think any oil should work - coconut / olive. Etc
6211 2018-07-29 16:52:44 Again, what the hell is facking? Is that when they drill through oil shale looking for natural gas?
6212 2018-07-29 16:52:36 Sweden has not been received people since forever.  Sweden was an extremely homogeneous country until recently. Immigration is a novelty and non-European immigration even more. You can let your country just grow old. What is the point of replacing your population with another?
6213 2018-07-29 16:52:33 What’s driving oil? Seasonality?
6214 2018-07-29 16:52:00 You get a bottle of shaving oil and then it’s a shipment of blades every three months (there are other schedules available). Heard good things about this one so thought I’d give it a go as fed up of spending a fortune with Gillette.

6223 2018-07-29 16:50:09 My dad gave me the best advice for roast potatoes; boil 'em for ~10 minutes, bash 'em up, then roast 'em. Duck fat works best if you can get it too! My favourite is roast carrots; cook them for ~10 minutes, cover in oil + mixed herbs, and roast for ~40 minutes <3 !

6239 2018-07-29 16:47:40 Thank you for this recommendation! In a rather surreal moment, earlier this month I was talking with the former mayor of Houston about TV shows & mentioned how I learned about a similarly between Alex Jones & GP who both essentially sell snake oil but to different folks. 1/2

6241 2018-07-29 16:47:33 If oil dries up today, only two states out of the 36 will survive. Which states and why?
6242 2018-07-29 16:47:29 I mean there’s also the fact that Exxon and the Kochs and such want access to Russia’s oil resources.

That’s why Trump is working for Putin and most of his Cabinet is connected to the Kochs. Pence too.

6248 2018-07-29 16:47:06 Venezuela created socialism within nationalist walls, funded by oil. When oil prices fell, the Venezuelan economy fell. The Soviet Union lasted as long as it did because it created a trade system within the Comintern world.

6250 2018-07-29 16:46:54 Please read the statistics of how many electric vehicles are built in last 10 years. How many coal powered plants are replaced by gas powered plants in Alberta.The demand for fossil fuel is on down forward spiral. Alberta needs a diversified economy not 100% oil based economy.
6251 2018-07-29 16:46:54 Ahhhh. Jamie does that, if he has a glass of water at night he sprinkles salt on it. From 3 feet above. And olive oil. And lemon juice. And a sprig of rosemary. And a nice fresh pukka.

6254 2018-07-29 16:46:41 Used oil resources to create a massive sovereign wealth fund & buy things that benefit everyone. They use their wealth wisely & for the public good. So yeah, it kinda is apples and oranges. We subsidize private oil biz to make huge profits on our resources to buy yachts & stuff.
6255 2018-07-29 16:46:34 No it can’t, that statement Deadass ignorant, that’s why I don’t let everyone do my hair because there’s people who think like that and they’ll fuck around and pull my shit out, I can’t put argan oil in my hair, I can’t use heavy grease in my hair either it’ll weigh it down

6263 2018-07-29 16:45:44 sigh lol....City basically became big because they were bought by an Emirate Oil baron who went on a major spending spree. Spurs do seem to choke everytime they are in a position to win anything in the past 4 years. No one expects that to change because they are losing players
6264 2018-07-29 16:45:43 Under Abbott the economy has gone from 3 to 21 & I don't see him trying to diversify at all(your biz stat like mine is mostly about oil prices-not something to brag about). Instead our teachers are paid below avg, taxes ridic & we spent $ on bathroom nonsense, not Harvey relief.

6269 2018-07-29 16:44:15 stopping immigration and deporting immigrants, which is I think the message of the anti-immigration parties. And as I said, saying that the position of the majority is far-right is really silly because that is a political spectrum that seems to be made by leftists in the media.

6273 2018-07-29 16:43:14 Also if you're gonna use essential oils on your skin, test on the underside of your upper arm before putting on your face. It's the closest to facial skin sensitivity and will give you a pretty accurate telling of how the oil will react.
6274 2018-07-29 16:43:13 This Model 3 is too brand new for a license plate. It has a special temporary permit till the plates come in. Likely because they will be custom. Many Tesla's have some kind of awesome novelty plate. Like @LeilaniMunter's Model S plate reads "EFF OIL"  Gotta love the humor!

6278 2018-07-29 16:42:47 I wouldn't put anything past Trump, but after years of putting up ugly casinos and being a game show host, he's gonna suddenly get into the oil business at 70? What are you basing this on?
6279 2018-07-29 16:42:45 I take the extra virgin olive oil and the parmesan!
The rest goes back to Jamie, thanks, but no thanks.
6280 2018-07-29 16:42:42 Sure, but it's still silly. Obviously no one really says that immigration is the cause of all problems, but the fact is that a society is made up of the people inhabiting it, so immigration is certainly the biggest topic. The problems caused by immigration are certainly solved by

6285 2018-07-29 16:42:13 you can get an oil free one! oily skinned people should still moisturize! it will make a huge difference in your skin texture. also toning after you remove your makeup, it takes off soooo much dirt and funk you didn’t know was there
6286 2018-07-29 16:42:12 I wonder if adding water - just a little - with the oil would help. Eggs might be a bit “poached “ but clean up may improve.
6287 2018-07-29 16:42:03 The right supporting big oil...was it not inevitable? They don’t believe in anything but profit, & to drum up support climate/alternative energy was an easy scapegoat. That’s the breadcrumb trail I followed.
6288 2018-07-29 16:41:56 just started my period and was WANTING TO MAKE MYSELF A PERSONAL PIZZA AND TAKE A BATH but then i realized i don’t have vegetable oil to make pizza fml

6293 2018-07-29 16:41:13 Putin needs to get oil prices up (that’s part of why he’s doing what he’s doing) so that Russia, essentially a petro-state, doesn’t go Venezuela on him.

(And the Russians don’t do him like they did the Romanovs.)
6294 2018-07-29 16:41:04 "polarization is bad! The hundreds of millions of dollars that oil and coal companies devoted to climate change denial think tanks has nothing to do with it. Also, even though we are destroying our planet, everything is good and is going to be better"
6295 2018-07-29 16:40:49 “It is perhaps pertinent to remind ourselves that oil is not the only marvel to emerge from the Delta swamps. There are also exotic creatures – mermaids, manatees, even mammy watas and hippopotami.”

King Amachree - July 17, 1954
6296 2018-07-29 16:40:49 I hope "Men are trash" twitter don't use any services from a man.
If you need a oil change, make sure its a lady doin it for you.
6297 2018-07-29 16:40:44 The infrastructure already exists. It’s called the natural gas distribution grid. And you keep mentioning SMR plants. I could mention the lovely oil power station giving you the electric for your car.
6298 2018-07-29 16:40:41 So are many Coal & Oil companies
6299 2018-07-29 16:40:40 Rub in baking soda to break down the sap then use an oil (vegetable, olive) to rub off.
6300 2018-07-29 16:40:37 Great. I make my own mayo with it. Great on salmon.
BUT... Chia seed oil is very high in 3's and very low in 6's. But the 3's are in the form of ALA, which needs to be converted by teh body. But chia maybe better than the 6's in avacodo oil.
6301 2018-07-29 16:40:32 Iranian Oil Check*
6302 2018-07-29 16:40:26 Irresponsible that many people don't have basic college or like to forget about it. All learn that micro-grams of some chemicals can kill (though Novichok even more lethal). To try a bottle without label -even noticing its not perfume but some kind of oil- and continue spraying..
6303 2018-07-29 16:40:20 Grandma's secret.. Hers was without tissue oil Kodwa it works wonders Honesty wanna buy vitamin E oil for my concuction.. Shea butter as well

But Yet still take their car to a man for a oil change.
6309 2018-07-29 16:40:00 ok, if he was really dedicated to this look...wheres the car oil?
6310 2018-07-29 16:40:00 PRICELESS coming from the likes of the GOP. Who have been covering and obstructing justice for trump. Who have been using their positions to enrich themselves, who done everything in the power to destroy the environment for oil and coal. #KARMA

Don't got make-up wipes? Vaseline + your face wash can come in a pinch to help but don't go crazy 'cause that's a lot of oil
6317 2018-07-29 16:39:38 Its so obvious when MultiMillion dollar companies keep making record profits but they "can't afford higher wages or taxes". Oil money is bigger than our democracies, this is why they invade countries like there is no tomorrow. We are brainwashed into capitalism. WAKE UP.
6318 2018-07-29 16:39:33 Got people who come into the shop who smell like shit and doesn’t have a single piece of clean clothing on but will buy an oil burner and it’s like damn bro. Drugs the only thing on your mind huh?

6330 2018-07-29 16:38:18 that you said anything. I was commenting on the topic in general. The conversation started because someone complained how far-right is used in the West.

6390 2018-07-29 16:30:47 With an economy dominated by oil, and the oil price doubled in 2 years, what difference does the "value" of the internal currency matter? Iran is 2x better off. And can trade with Russia and China. So, your point of FX value is what exactly?

Es mejor vender a 60$ y vender 1,5 MBD.

6404 2018-07-29 16:29:02 The mention of your support for the Tropical Rainforest Initiative (while your Taxscam Bill opens the Alaska wilderness to oil and gas exploration) is a reminder to ask how your plan to bring healthcare to Ukrainian soldiers is going (as you work to deny it to Americans)?

6408 2018-07-29 16:28:05 No they dont. Oil pipes still leak, trains still derail, coal ash still seeps, wind turbines still kill eagles, solar arrays still super heat the air. Excessive regulations, especially duplicates, just cost customers money.

6413 2018-07-29 16:27:11 It is not a struggle to maintain "a Swedish way of life".  It's an attempt to maintain standards of modern civilization.  Forced marriage at any age is not acceptable.  Forced marriage of young girls is just outrageous.

6416 2018-07-29 16:27:03 Fossil fuel companies are realizing that a carbon tax would hasten the shift away from coal, with much of that demand shifting toward NG and even oil. That will benefit the oil & NG industry.

The current President has strong ties to coal country. That's the biggest obstacle imo.

Like other day I refuse margarine with palm oil altho was marked vegan.
I blv veganism is about doing our best, not perfection!
6425 2018-07-29 16:25:25 Then and There India has to improve it's manufacturing industry and become export economy as soon as it can.
Because our foreign exchange reserve declined recently because of higher oil prices and our Current account deficit and Trade deficit is increasing day by day.

6430 2018-07-29 16:25:05 Either those or my pure cbd oil pills and maybe add a beverage.  

On that note, that is still legitimately the only “medicine” that helps me. People that try to ban even the cbd or medical pot....they baffle me.
6431 2018-07-29 16:25:01 As long as we have Veterans coming home damaged and not able to have a job or insurance cause they didn't do 20 your policy is BS! Y'all broke these veterans you fix them!

6433 2018-07-29 16:24:56 Saw a documentary on this. They are swimming in oil right now. They do not have the pipelines so they are burning off the natural gas the oil wells are producing. What a waste.

6441 2018-07-29 16:23:51 Truthfully, I think the problem began before that. Its roots are in the importation of all our oil and the failed production of energy here. Unfortunately, Reagan, for all his "right ideas" was a "free trader," which did a great deal of harm.

6469 2018-07-29 16:21:28 With Venezuela failing and you pulling out of the Iran deal, oil is likely to go over $100 this year - taking money out of consumer wallets, which will further negatively impact growth.

6483 2018-07-29 16:19:10 Russia-US is a multi-faceted issue:

- Avoiding nuclear conflict w/Putin is #1 goal - after #HRC explicitly threaten to attack Russia!

6486 2018-07-29 16:18:57 I literally just bought my shampoo, conditioner & hair oil for $109 including shipping & that will last for only 3 months. But that is because that’s the only product so far that works for my hair. That is self love to shell out that amount of money for my hair. Do better.

6489 2018-07-29 16:18:39 Venezuelan oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts. They were using a state-run economics model. Chavez succeeded in chasing out all the private companies.

6513 2018-07-29 16:16:25 I will always feel Nafta ruined America.

6515 2018-07-29 16:16:21 The current political union gives Scots no voice. Or one so small it is drowned out and progress is hindered socially and economically. Had Scotland been independent it would have controlled oil revenues in a far more fiscally sound manner. Similarly to Norway.

6523 2018-07-29 16:14:36 That could because the left has convinced itself that any culture that is majority white has no culture and they need to bring in migrants to bring in culture that white people can't take part in or it is cultural appropriation.
6524 2018-07-29 16:14:18 Humidify tea tree oil or add it to boiling water and then leave top of pan on and after boils u can breathe in the steam! Sounds odd but, it works for quick sick fix! Lol

6547 2018-07-29 16:11:44 You gotta start small. Example: Advent of modern electric cars came from our over-dependence on Middle East oil. We all know that. But we didn’t just jump to it. First came smog laws, then mandatory fuel efficiency, then hybrids and now hopefully electric cars.

6564 2018-07-29 16:09:38 Sears directed me to mower repair shop who determined low oil caused the motor failure. The dipstick, however, indicates there is sufficient oil. I picked up mower from shop, no evidence they even dismantled motor to investigate AND they took my spark plug
6565 2018-07-29 16:09:35 I keep my on always except when I use jojoba oil or handcream.
Mine is black so I don’t have to protect it from water like rose gold need to be.
6566 2018-07-29 16:09:16 Yeah, and I will also hope that our national parks are spared from mining and oil wells. I will hope that endangered species are protected. I will hope that the hundreds of pubescent girls shipped from the border to New York are not sex trafficked.
6567 2018-07-29 16:09:04 Yeah, but he will try to check your oil!

6579 2018-07-29 16:07:46 Exactly! Multiple cities in flames, EPA being reduced to inadequacy, offering big oil everything under the sun, disregarding climate change on every level. Listen to firefighters talk & they say that fighting fires used to be seasonal & is now year round.

The Primary Christian Faith believes that this is the physical gift from God to mankind to keep us healthy. Jesus required his disciples to give it to the sick.

Deliberate in that he was knowingly spreading information known to be false & attacking those that tried to correct the lies.

6604 2018-07-29 16:04:53 That is the opinion but so far, there is no slowing of growth. If Permian production slows, world price will increase and then, perhaps rail transport will make sense as it did for the Bakken at higher oil prices. Only a guess, of course.
6605 2018-07-29 16:04:52 don't hate gulf Arabs as well tbh. They basically Geeljires/Bedouins that were blessed with billions of barrels of oil. Explains why they poor playing politics. They the closest it got culturally. Only difference maybe was Somalis was Sufis & they was very conservative salafis

6607 2018-07-29 16:04:28 What about avacodo oil? Six's not too high, and we do need some sixes.
6608 2018-07-29 16:04:22 Very interesting article that you might like to read. Very small oil rich homogeneous population carefully controlling immigration to keep it that way.  Kind of apples and oranges to me
6609 2018-07-29 16:04:02 Chávez should have nationalized Polar right after the attempted coup, when oil prices were still strong and they had plenty of time to iron out any kinks. Instead, they had to make due with parallel programs once the shit started to hit the fan.

6638 2018-07-29 15:59:50 That's what they're after. Waiting for the slightest opportunity to try and tarnish one's image.
6639 2018-07-29 15:59:42 If you have a membership you can always try Costco. I’ve heard they do oil changes.
6640 2018-07-29 15:59:37 Very true. My shower is covered in different products. I have 4 shampoos, 3 conditioners, an exfoliating charcoal stick cleanser, an oil cleanser, 3 body washes, and 2 shaving creams. My lotion stash is to big to even summarize.
6641 2018-07-29 15:59:35 So what you're saying is, technically they're supposed to use vegan oil but you doubt the people that work there are actually following that rule? Because that I can believe

6651 2018-07-29 15:58:09 Norway is the fifth largest exporter of oil and the second largest exporter of natural gas. They are Saudi Arabia with snow.  They are also a homogeneous population of less than 5 million people with a 50% tax rate.
6652 2018-07-29 15:57:53 Let’s say a US company buys $1 billion in oil from the Middle East and uses that to run their plants and make products for sale in the US and abroad. Did the US lose in this transaction ? It’s absurd if you think so
6653 2018-07-29 15:57:47 Correct about Putin
Putin wanted Trump to:
Increase Nato strength
US selling more LNG to EU (hurts Russia)
US become largest oil producing country (hurts Russia)
increase our economy and Military

Playing right into Putins hand

6665 2018-07-29 15:56:10 Speaking about corporate welfare, what about the oil industry subsidies ? They have been getting subsidized by the Gov't since the 1940's, there is no need to help a multi-Trillion dollar oil company.. money could be better used in other ways..

6669 2018-07-29 15:55:29 Gee, I wonder what this is doing for our gas prices, especially when Iran disrupts oil flow of tankers through The Straits of Hormuz, maybe 5 dollars a gallon at the pumps. So much winning.
6670 2018-07-29 15:55:17 It's upto som1 to choose to have children or not, but once they're, they shud be brought up properly.
I wud say it apply much for small country like bangladesh with huge population.

6705 2018-07-28 23:57:51 yeah these are non alcoholic essential oil  hippie  drinks mine had Kava and cbd oil in it.. it tasted horrible but I was hella relaxed afterwards

6707 2018-07-28 23:57:49 Would be a pity if Bernie did the same thing to Hillary about taking money from oil companies.
6708 2018-07-28 23:57:47 Blacken whole thing under broiler, cool & peel & drain, mix with olive oil, salt, lemon, mashed garlic, spread in pita. Can add diced tomato, parsley

6711 2018-07-28 23:57:37 Terrible idea. US needs to restrict ALL MINING of everything and end drilling for oil and gas. Close all nuclear plants, coal fueled, oil and gas fueled plants. Go green. Solar, wind and thermal power only. Electric generating plants must be powered by wind and solar only.
6712 2018-07-28 23:57:36 I love how it randomly and suddenly transitions from patriotism to legal advice to an advertisement for Marathon - and then incorrectly advertising Marathon Oil which is *NOT* HQ'd in Findlay, Marathon *Petroleum* is.

11/10 can't wait to see what he does for the next election
6713 2018-07-28 23:57:30 “Perhaps yourself not so much I.” He begun but only because he assumed it might not be appropriate. “I would suggest a oil infused bath, your grace. — it feels wonderful with achy muscles.”
6714 2018-07-28 23:57:29 yes it is always given a spin ...like peak oil stories start once oil goes above 100 and below 50 too much oil ..currencies same thing..cycles
6715 2018-07-28 23:57:16 Yes, I might have used an old, freezer-burnt fish stick for my sandwich. But I made the toast from rustic pain de campagne I smeared with olive oil, herbs n garlic and put fresh pesto and fresh mesclun greens on there.
6716 2018-07-28 23:57:07 The rub is olive oil and herbs.

Grilled sparagus is where it’s at!

6727 2018-07-28 23:55:35 A capitalist economy with more robust investment in public goods. 

Nationalized Norwegian oil fields no more make Norway a socialist country than the existence of Amtrak makes America a socialist country.

6729 2018-07-28 23:55:14 Make sure you season it , spray with oil and bake at I think 400 for an hr or 2 , it's been awhile but yea

6731 2018-07-28 23:54:46 My mom said that my birthday present this year is her paying for me to get my oil changed and I’m actually really happy about that...is this what being a real adult feels like?

6733 2018-07-28 23:54:16 if anyone cares, our local butcher sells CBD oil now
6734 2018-07-28 23:54:16 Totally, just make sure you get some valve oil too because I am p sure they need it and the only complaint I hear out of box is that the slide is a little sticky
6735 2018-07-28 23:54:11 Beeswax!
- put a teaspoon of beeswax in a clean container
- take TWO teaspoons of petroleum jelly and add it to the beeswax 
- add 3-5 drops of cinnamon and wintergreen essential oil
- add 2-3 drops of menthol essential oil to it and mix well to form a blended mixture
6736 2018-07-28 23:54:07 With olive oil and lemon or unseasoned??
6737 2018-07-28 23:54:03 Shiiit, I ask my co worker if I could hit her vape..

Nope straight oil, so I proceeded to hit it more.

*keeps tea tree oil in her purse at all times*
6739 2018-07-28 23:53:27 Pick up gram of oil
6740 2018-07-28 23:53:24 especially when people say “i don’t like dark girls” but repost photos of dark skin models, with hourglass figures, in lingerie, dripping in oil
6741 2018-07-28 23:53:04 i got this coffee sea salt tea tree oil thing from the brazilian wax place and it’s an exfoliator scrub and it spilled on cyd’s hands and she goes “omg pussy stuff is on meeeee” and i’m still laughing about it
6742 2018-07-28 23:52:44 Fried in oil, then soaked in it afterwards?
6743 2018-07-28 23:52:37 why dont they do away with school buildings all together and give the teachers the bus' then they can have a mobile class room and help buy more oil while they drive around the country teaching kids while they sit on the ground and chip away at rocks for paper?

6746 2018-07-28 23:51:57 Who's locking hands? Do u keep up with the Ukraine and Crimea? Is that DJT locking hands while telling putin we won't recognize Crimea as anything bit Ukrainian? Or why he publicly blasted Merkel for buying Russian oil? No ones locking hands more like locking horns cupcake -
6747 2018-07-28 23:51:50 We are a very rich country that has all the money necessary to fund the planet's largest military budget, mostly for new weapons systems that are marginal. Also billions in subsidies for oil companies. And Big Pharma. and ... and ... oh, TAX CUTS for billionaires!
6748 2018-07-28 23:51:26 Seems unreasonable to blame this on all the humans... oil and gas companies maybe more to blame?!
6749 2018-07-28 23:51:21 Isn’t it crazy that fast food used to use tallow and then some ass holes campaigned to get them frying in veggie oil? Ass holes, I tell you.
6750 2018-07-28 23:51:16 The well-being of the Canadian economy correlates directly with the health of private sector who had already risked billions on TMX. 

The public sector took over the oil industry in Venezuela - it's not going so well.

6752 2018-07-28 23:50:46 cinnamon oil and vaseline!
- put a pinch of vaseline or any petroleum jelly in a small clean container 
- add a few drops of cinnamon oil in a small container. 2-3 drops is good.
- use a clean piece of cotton wool to apply to your lips
- longer time=bigger lips
6753 2018-07-28 23:50:05 My ex used to fry it in a pan with oil and then put peanut butter on them. Freaking disgusting 
6754 2018-07-28 23:49:39 Tree tea oil  !!!! Mix it with a little witch hazel. I use a tiny amount of it without mixing it with anything but apparently it’s not good to do that... oops! It clears up pimples for me! I also use 9-5 face wash from lush and it’s gotten rid of all my blackheads on my nose ?
6755 2018-07-28 23:49:31 The voice of those 20-30 years of age express their distrust in Exxon and the government providing any benefit to the country. They say they need jobs! The work is given to foreigners while the locals suffer. The elders have witnessed the corruption with oil around the world Con:

6759 2018-07-28 23:49:07 @AndyCarlsonShow suggestion: add Dawn to the laundry to get that oil stain out of your Ali shirt. Squirt some on the spot directly, let it soak in for a few, then wash. Hope it works (works for me).
6760 2018-07-28 23:49:04 Thought they were looking rather shiny thought you must just moisturise with oil base creams 
6761 2018-07-28 23:49:04 I never thought to use that on anything but hair  I tried using coconut oil and olive oil but it stays on forever!
6762 2018-07-28 23:49:02 This global warming disaster is brought to you by Big Oil Liars. Like Big Tobacco, they threw us all under the bus to build their mansions of gold.
6763 2018-07-28 23:49:01 Perhaps GOP congress will donate their very substantial pensions & expense acts.
Or...we could use subsidies given to wealthy big oil.
Or...we could repeal the rich people tax cuts.
Or...use Trump's travel & golf budget.
We’re the wealthiest country in the world. It’s doable.

6767 2018-07-28 23:48:02 @realDonaldTrump if you want oil prices to go down, do without tariffs on steel.  Economics 101- When it costs more money to drill an oil well, less drilling happens, therefore less supply.  More demand for oil and less supply makes oil prices go up.  Understand?

6781 2018-07-28 23:45:09 Nothing moves quickly in the physical market. Cheating; scrubbers will ameliorate & producers are already positioning eg BP. Dunno how cost/btu of heavy fuel oil compares with coal fired power generation in China & India.

6787 2018-07-28 23:44:01 Should I keep drinking or should I take some cbd oil, tuck myself into bed, open up my book on essays about dead girls, and go to sleep?
6788 2018-07-28 23:43:52 You can use a tile sealer to protect the finish.  We have used oil based clear coat finish to add additional protection, if you are concerned with wear.  I try and leave original finishes whenever possible.

6794 2018-07-28 23:42:19 Awwwwe, how sweet. Some friends of mine in California were blessed enough to have ample supply, and offered to send me some extra CBD oil that their collective produces. I cannot wait to try it! The last time I had CBD oil, it was like I was ten years younger.
6795 2018-07-28 23:42:17 He knows it’s not a hoax. He just doesn’t want any regulations on his lifestyle or the corporate profits of him or his industrial buddies. One of which is Russia that “earns” a sh*t-ton of money on oil sales.

6800 2018-07-28 23:41:21 I don’t understand how the Democratic Party can try and tell on trump but not talk about how they started the bankruptcy of America. Look at  the price we are paying for real-estate gas, oil,utility’s,tuitions,and interest rates have increased on just about everything!

6808 2018-07-28 23:40:08 I was going to do pescatarian but I’m thinking I’m going to just do fish oil vitamins instead.
6809 2018-07-28 23:39:25 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6810 2018-07-28 23:38:58 I will start buying palm oil here and take it to Niger state to sell, why I bring groundnut and soya bean from there to southwest
6811 2018-07-28 23:38:51 just told my dad I want to learn how to change my oil and how to replace a flat and the look he gave me....

6814 2018-07-28 23:38:27 Us citizens can’t see why the us corporate media is given copious attention towards the economic situation in Venezuela. It’s due to the fact Venezuela is rich in oil why Venezuela is so attacked by the political and corporate media establishment
6815 2018-07-28 23:38:12 Does anyone not see that the Downer name was actually a liability in Mayo? Mr Downer should accept some responsibility for this. The wire tapping of East Timor re oil was on his watch.
6816 2018-07-28 23:38:09 Explain exactly how DJT is treasonous -what crime did he comity proving he "colluded" against the USA -u have nothing -y would be blast Merkel for Russian oil purchase? Or about Crimea? Oh cause he's not colluding w Russia
6817 2018-07-28 23:38:08 Well our brainy leaders are literally buying a pipeline with our tax money, and increasing oil production.  Our leaders are LIARS.

6819 2018-07-28 23:37:42 What is it about socialism that is attracting you? Is it the abject poverty like Venezuela 1 of the most oil rich nations? Is it the total dominance and lack of freedoms? Look at CA, go to jail if a waitress gives you a straw. Socialism always fails historically proven.

6823 2018-07-28 23:36:41 i did .5 seconds of research and decided i should try out argan oil and amazon had one for £30 which is like ~the original and one for £3 which also had great reviews so i'm like. is there even an option
6824 2018-07-28 23:36:38 Have you tried Tecnu? I used it when I got into poison ivy last month. Helps limit the spread of the urushiol oil.
6825 2018-07-28 23:36:29 OK. The increase is present. However you gotta remember (and I not defending the NDP) that Trump tax cuts made it more attractive for oil companies to do bus in USA; also more expensive to get the oil out in AB. This bust however does feel diff. UCP won't be able to reverse this.
6826 2018-07-28 23:36:28 bofa deez fat cocks. some oil.

6829 2018-07-28 23:35:46 My head is pounding. I wish I had the DoTerra essential oil that got rid of headaches. Can’t remember the name of it.

6833 2018-07-28 23:34:34 Plenty of red pizzas without cheese and just have dried pasta instead of fresh and ask for without cheese. So many gorgeous tomato sauce pastas or olive oil pasta options
6834 2018-07-28 23:34:02 Why is he misinformed? The oil companies are reporting major profits and yet at the same time are whining to Ottawa for tax cuts. I don't think the NDP can do much about the tax cuts by the Trump and I don't believe we should provide these cuts in Canada. Cash flow is cash flow.

6840 2018-07-28 23:33:31 The biggest  expenditures are imported fuel. Saudi Arabia in past gave us relief when we did atomic bombs tests by either giving oil on reduced payment or deferred payment. The electricity production by burning fuel was more expensive way to produce and only for political gain.
6841 2018-07-28 23:33:29 Disappointed with #mrlube on Steeles Milton,go for an oil change end up with 180$ in repairs that they caused and then when I tryto solve the problem all I get is being ignored not cool @mrlube I will not be using the service again and I’ll make sure no one I know doesn’t either.

6852 2018-07-28 23:31:17 If anything worked the way it was supposed to work right out of of the box, I would anoint that thing with oil and speak an exorcism over it. NOTHING works right out of the box. NOTHING.
6853 2018-07-28 23:30:41 Yes... the chicken itself is of your choice, I use tenders or boneless thigh a... then after it’s fried, I use a Dutch oven, and then it’s a mixture of vegetable oil, cayenne, garlic pwd, paprika, and couple of things and you brush it on the chicken and serve it accordingly
6854 2018-07-28 23:29:52 You know I'm sure tubbs fat could make amazing oil. So greasy and slippery maybe tubbs is secretly the worlds greatest untapped fuel source
6855 2018-07-28 23:29:44 Listen my fat ass is going to get some food, by the time I come back, eat, and oil my scalp, y’all need to start talking about important topics, like Chrella

6857 2018-07-28 23:29:33 Pk military facilitated talks between Afghan Taliban and US. So that spigot will be re-opened (around $2 Billion/yr). 

IMF+World Bank+Asian Development Bank will give approximately $4 Billion in "soft loans".  

SaudiA+UAE to offer generous repayment terms for oil purchases
6858 2018-07-28 23:29:28 I think Trump was offered a cut in the big oil deal if sanctions lifted. Thats what Tillerson was about.
6859 2018-07-28 23:29:27 Bet that the oil companies love that!

6865 2018-07-28 23:28:09 Seriously, Australia not using uranium sounds as absurd as if Saudi Arabia banned oil use. 
6866 2018-07-28 23:27:54 I and you can't let our Nation down, everything we have done has brought us to where we are today, but our sincere resolution for true unity is important then the rich oil wells and other resources put to gather. one united Nigeria.

Why does Scalise stay silent when Trump's policies harm LA, including tariffs which are hurting the port, soybean farmers, oil/gas.?I've voted for him in past, I prayed for his healing. But he is wrong on so much, including ACA, too, which will hurt LA. -- A cancer survivor

6874 2018-07-28 23:26:47 I'm a million times more worried about the smoke from the burning synthetic oil surrounding the aircraft during walk arounds.

6876 2018-07-28 23:26:12 Eh, I use either an immersion blender (for 1 egg and one cup of oil) or my food processor (for 2+ eggs, 2+ cups of oil). I dump all the ingredients minus the oil into the food processor, and use the slow feeder for the oil. Done and done.
6877 2018-07-28 23:25:42 Venezuela had debt denominated in US$ (Which they don't create) and the price of oil dropped, which is pretty much their only export. Their has never been a case of hyperinflation in a functioning economy like the US. It takes extreme shock to supply side, or debt in foreign 
6878 2018-07-28 23:25:40 Does Denmark have open immigration? If you think you can turn our country 180° quickly you are going to be disappointed. The majority do not even pay attention to these things we are against- private prisons, inmate sexual assault, living wages, oil leaks, wealth inequality, etc.
6879 2018-07-28 23:25:12 If we dont drill the oil, another country will. How about when China and India catch up to the USA in emissions control, we worry about it then. They are 72% of the world's population. USA is only 5%. We can change nothing.

6888 2018-07-28 23:24:04 Not to be a dick, but Suncor bought out numerous oil companies when they went belly up the last three years. This was inevitable and nothing to celebrate in my opinion

6892 2018-07-28 23:23:11 “It has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,” she says. “So rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.”

6899 2018-07-28 23:22:17 I hate using oil paint because it take so long to dry
6900 2018-07-28 23:22:14 Well what I mean by “oil” is free market extraction of commodities, unhindered by environmental regulation (to all extent possible), which distinguishes cons from libs or even social democrats. (I think).
6901 2018-07-28 23:22:05 @MBuhari a genius,  he has broken the monopoly of Atiku's INTEL. Atiku deliberately made Warri port idle and unusable for oil logistics,  Warri port is being dredged as we speak to allow big vessels and link to Iktape -Warri rail project. #Buhariornothing.

6928 2018-07-28 23:16:47 Mr Olodo that proposed refinery you are deliberately refusing to say the truth about is 100% fully private driven. It will be taking its crude oil from the neighbouring Niger Republic. Or is Dangote not building a similar one at the suburb of Lagos, Ajah - Epe axis.
6929 2018-07-28 23:16:32 Doesn’t he know the supply of the world’s oil is going down. There were so many dinosaurs after all. He should be increasing the creation of alternative and cleaner energy technologies.

6967 2018-07-28 23:09:56 Yes. But I don’t think “oil” is a core *principle*. In “oil” we find the confluence of many affinities of different types of conservatives. But also some of the antipathies: there are still plenty of “Big Oil is gouging us at the Gas Pumps” conservatives around.

6973 2018-07-28 23:08:54 Another challenge I found was access to the materials, until I found I could download the APICS books after requesting to. Since I work on an oil rig, carrying all those books was burdensome and took up space. The pdf books were much easier for me to use and mark up.

6990 2018-07-28 23:06:42 Honestly #NoSideEffects is my fave thing about @NaturesUltra CBD Oil products. I get side effects from most prescriptions.  #Natural #AlternativeMedicine
6991 2018-07-28 23:06:32 I am not being naive, and I am not being flip. I mean to say, I get a sense that people see Putin twirling his mustaches like Snidley Whiplash or a Bond villain but I’m really not clear what he’s after. How does chaos help Russia?  Is this all just vendetta?  Or is oil to be had?
6992 2018-07-28 23:06:09 Bacheloring tonight, cooked up a real meal. Deer backstrap slices, sliced onion, both soaked in milk then roll in biscuit flower Fry in grape seed oil 2 minutes each side Serve with baked swt potato/fresh garden salad. gooood!  Don’t like deer like this, you can’t be helped.
6993 2018-07-28 23:05:39 She wants to help create Medicare for all by taxing oil, and at the same time get rid of fossil fuels. So your going to kill the milk cow. Didn’t we use to lock up socialists and communists. Let’s do that.
6994 2018-07-28 23:05:34 I am sure you are NOT well informed as to the laws in our 50 states, protectorates, teritories and thousands special districts that make up the United States.  You are Wrong about this. Stop the rubbish talk. And to blame Christians is also wrong.

6996 2018-07-28 23:05:19 Do birth control pills cause/cure acne? Birth control pills may help some women control acne. The hormones in birth control pills can help block androgen hormones. Androgen puts oil glands into overdrive. Even if u take birth control pills, you'll still need a skincare routine.

7002 2018-07-28 23:04:36 Wow...an endorsement by Ted “l’m not leaving the senate until I’ve made all the money I can off of my many donors like: Golman Sachs, oil companies, ‘The Club For Growth’ and the NRA” Cruz.
7003 2018-07-28 23:04:29 Yes we did. Meanwhile, the Norwegians poured plenty of their oil riches into a national sovereign wealth fund.
7004 2018-07-28 23:04:18 If we want Nigerian elected officials to do the right thing often, we need to build political parties that are funded and run by people who want the right thing done. You can't expect parties funded by embezzlement, inflated contracts, & arbitrary oil bloc grants to work for you.

7010 2018-07-28 23:03:44 Haven’t had oil but cbd comes in several different forms and is wonderous. Highly recommend to any and everyone!
7011 2018-07-28 23:03:44 i always knew coconut oil was good for hair but never tried it, thank you!!
7012 2018-07-28 23:03:37 Thanks buddy. Time to get wasted. Haha.

7016 2018-07-28 23:02:38 My dad and I just rubbed tea tree oil all over us so we don’t get attacked by mosquitoes 
7017 2018-07-28 23:02:31 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
7018 2018-07-28 23:02:10 Actually not true if you remove the bottom 10 to 15 percentiles that literally have 0.
At that point the numbers turn around and the top 1% fall behind in total wealth.
7019 2018-07-28 23:02:06 بارك الله فيك الموضوع يتمحور عن اليهود سؤالي لك بدون تشعب .. الله سبحانه لماذا مسخهم قردة وخنازير ؟ أليس هناك سبب عن غضب الرحمن اذا عرف السبب بُطل العجب .. شكرا لك

7021 2018-07-28 23:01:51 What’s next for Exxon other than oil? How bout Google other than ads? Ford other than cars? Netflix other than streaming? JP Morgan other than banking? Pfizer other than drugs? Boeing other than planes?

7029 2018-07-28 23:00:45 Not my child, but a student asked why do we continue fracking when it causes earthquakes? Isn't there a better way to get oil? Can't we use something besides oil?
7030 2018-07-28 23:00:43 More about the breakdown of sanctions as Hussein pushed terrorism. The oil thing was part of why Iraq was (& is) important but getting US companies access was never a motivation, just a bs line pushed by opponents of the war. Again, a bad argument made central.

7036 2018-07-28 22:59:46 Plus he's about to destroy large parts of Alaska.  To get oil that is not needed.
7037 2018-07-28 22:59:37 Bro do you know that we are living a crisis? Also, all the oil money goes to Iraqi banks which only 17% of it comes to Kurdistan and by that money they can’t solve all the crisis, jt needs time

7039 2018-07-28 22:59:29 Ghana exported 58 million barrels of crude oil in 2017.

7049 2018-07-28 22:58:12 Lmao I told my parents I was going almost 120 on this lil car they gave me when I got the truck an oil change boy I thought I was a racing car
7050 2018-07-28 22:58:08 I recommend you use face masks,coconut oil and creams they’re not as effective lakn they’re save
7051 2018-07-28 22:57:51 I’m more oil than man at this point
7052 2018-07-28 22:57:49 Tell you what. You just go ahead and keep blaming voters. You won't win a damn thing, and I'll be living in Denmark where people's tax actually goes to help people. Not private prisons, military contractors, health insurance companies, and subsidizing oil and gas. Good luck.
7053 2018-07-28 22:57:48 I like patchouli oil
7054 2018-07-28 22:57:42 It never fails, every time I change the oil in my car it gets on every. single. tool.

7060 2018-07-28 22:56:42 Wouldn’t it make sense if you went to wash your car after coming in for an oil change rather than before since my dirty ass gloves are going to touch your car
7061 2018-07-28 22:56:40 Can someone give me the tea on cbd oil???
7062 2018-07-28 22:56:15 okay the real question is why do furbies need motor oil what does it do
7063 2018-07-28 22:56:06 Go to @Costco and get a gallon of olive oil, a few pounds of pine nuts, a bunch of peeled garlic and about 10 ice trays.

Make a bunch of pesto ice cubes and you’ll be happy all winter!!

فهم أصل البلاء والفساء والمحن في العالم
7071 2018-07-28 22:55:12 Hmmm.... So I shouldn't pour olive oil into my furby is what youre saying
7072 2018-07-28 22:55:08 Well aware. Playing off the troubles weve had in 2017-2018 and going forward as being related entirely to the bust is a lie though. US oil companies for example are highly profitable again in Q2, companies in Alberta are shutting in production and posting losses. Unacceptable.

7074 2018-07-28 22:54:58 All good points. I’m thinking of “core principles.”  What makes modern conservatism click? Surely there are many many things that Scheer, Bernier and Wall would agree on.  (oil, for instance).

7083 2018-07-28 22:53:46 Yes, exactly.  Most of the people riding Harley's wouldn't know how to change the oil.

7098 2018-07-28 22:51:09 one thing that helped me tremendously was getting put on a birth control that had been shown to help improve acne! i also use neutrogena oil free face wash, signed up and started using curology which was GREAT and also stopped using makeup wipes!
7099 2018-07-28 22:50:58 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

7104 2018-07-28 22:50:16 yes! Just learned about this magical oil the other day and planning this fall to harvest from the bushes by my house. Maybe not 2.5 million bottles...
7105 2018-07-28 22:49:58 นอนค่ะ เพ้อจริง
7106 2018-07-28 22:49:57 Send him out for an oil change.
7107 2018-07-28 22:49:57 Venezuela failed mostly because of extremely corrupt politicians. You can’t have an oil rich country being controlled by people who are pocketing the money for decades. A similar thing happened in Trinidad and Tobago. Research it. Using Venezuela as an example doesn’t work.
7108 2018-07-28 22:49:52 Ya ...but you must of ment oil company supporting the slippery political snakes!
7109 2018-07-28 22:49:48 If you take care of your beard (wash, oil, brush it) then it isn’t unhygienic. I think most women think they’re sexy (maybe not the long ones ). Otherwise why else would men grow them  I know I do 
7110 2018-07-28 22:49:42 True. Hate that! How about a barber shop? Shave, trim, cut whatever you need while debating on what you’re grocery list is? Could have a dry cleaners in the corner too. A true one stop shop would also have a oil change/tire rotation area, but I’m just a chick what do I know? 
7111 2018-07-28 22:49:40 Coconut oil??? Jk.

7116 2018-07-28 22:49:00 These facts, data driven, are contrary to the general perception the headline attempts to create. More whites on welfare is not the same as whites being more likely to use it than any other demographic group. In fact the contrary is true.
7117 2018-07-28 22:48:58 Yeah, as others have said, lack of water, lack of sleep, stress, and dietary/allergy factors all are common culprits. I’ve gotten migraines since I was child—I’m much better at avoiding them, but not always. Lavender/peppermint essential oil compresses are a great relief though.
7118 2018-07-28 22:48:56 Hey @ayoadebenjamin I never criticised anyone but I learn and love to discuss with them as long as their statement and logic make sense! Really creative definitions especially the data science is oil part haha! You are awesome and I wish to learn more from you

7123 2018-07-28 22:48:02 余裕綽々の出発のはずが、誰かさんが忘れ物をしたせいで汗だくになりながら駅と下宿の往復だよ
7124 2018-07-28 22:47:55 btw treating your hair with coconut oil the night before and after the bleaching really improves the results.
7125 2018-07-28 22:47:42 Not at all. How do you explain plastic? Given how manufactured your club has become!! Did you see how they had them all dressed!! Oil money cannot buy class or style it seems
7126 2018-07-28 22:47:39 @taylorswift13 @taylornation13 Hello, all! I see Boston is rocking this weekend! Hope your third show is awesome tonight, Taylor! Great duet with Hayley Kiyoko too! :-)

7127 2018-07-28 22:47:38 Am I a bad dad for putting my kid in a camp to learn to ride a bike instead of teaching her myself? I figure she will learn faster this way
7128 2018-07-28 22:47:37 hahahaha mine either! usually i have to cover them in oil & put only them in the sun lol it works !!
7129 2018-07-28 22:47:27 All I know is that the PM and his cabinet has proposed a new law, strengthening the current one and removing the exceptions so no marriage before 18 yo is considered legal. This should take effect beginning of next year. But this about UN, do you have a link? Sounds weird.
7130 2018-07-28 22:47:25 #Venezuela has no more reserves, so now the new reserves will be oil that is still underground. Anybody that lends on that base is an idiot!
7131 2018-07-28 22:47:21 Poor old Malcolm, left with an egg and oil emulsion on his face.
7132 2018-07-28 22:47:11 WD40 is an essential oil, right????
7133 2018-07-28 22:46:51 The 6 classes of food are Carbohydrates, Protein, fats and oil, Vitamins,Minerals and Water #ThatOneThing
7134 2018-07-28 22:46:30 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

7136 2018-07-28 22:46:28 I've thought about the cannabis oil however I'm not sure how that effects my type of migraine (I haven't met many with hemiplegic migraines to be able to ask what helped best.) I've not really considered acupuncture because I've been poked & prodded for botox and trigger points
7137 2018-07-28 22:46:26 怖かったけど無事です
7138 2018-07-28 22:46:24 I did wonder, but this one is supposed to be on OUR side. Surely Putes wants us to keep drinking his oil!
7139 2018-07-28 22:46:14 Nonsense!

Can't make them their fry ups without the essential oil of sunflower or olive.
7140 2018-07-28 22:46:08 In Mussolini's case, he started "IRI", which bought up all the failed companies and banks of Italy. From Alfa Romeo to local utilities, an oil company, banks, etc....
7141 2018-07-28 22:46:08 We need oil to achieve these lofty goals of not needing oil.
7142 2018-07-28 22:46:01 got a nice combo of coconut oil and watermelon juice all over me rn
7143 2018-07-28 22:46:00 Oil and coal lobbying has a strangle hold on our political process
7144 2018-07-28 22:45:47 You've just put a coat of Danish oil on your new solid wood interior doors and are desperate to get a second coat on, so you ask the carpenter, "When shall I put the next coat on?" Carpenter replies...
7145 2018-07-28 22:45:32 In the last 2 days, I am pretty sure I have helped @Tesla sell a number of new cars, or at least people that are seriously investigating the option of going to a Tesla.  We should all be ambassadors to wain our country from the big oil..... #Model3
7146 2018-07-28 22:45:27 Nope.
Watch them give evidence in the select committees.

Full of promise, limited detail and come up empty on actual practical plan or implementation.

Classic is the "cut and paste" trade deal idea.
Another is the customs proposals, another N.Ireland border.
Snake oil sellers.
7147 2018-07-28 22:45:21 Exon 2017 revenue:  237 billion.  Almost a quarter of a trillion dollars.  Shell 305.  BP 240 and poor Chevron at 142.  Oil company revenues are staggering.
7148 2018-07-28 22:45:20 やらかしたなぁ
7149 2018-07-28 22:45:17 Honestly, the writing has been on the wall for a long while. To bad oil money actively fought the truth.
7150 2018-07-28 22:45:01 Oh. Now that is an amazing point. Oil became the new gold and now water is becoming the new oil. Good catch!
7151 2018-07-28 22:44:59 Well I recently bought the Mario badescu oil free spf 30 moisturizer. And it’s good for combination skin. So I’m yet to try it Bc I have a problem w moisturizers and my t zone breaking out Bc I’ve tried everything
7152 2018-07-28 22:44:54 Then, cartoonist, you’d come to Spain and witness roman constructions,
castles, churches, cathedrals, muslim palaces, sculptures, paintings.. History made stone, wood, oil on canvas. Whole country we’re living is an art museum
7153 2018-07-28 22:44:48 Wanted to make fried chicken but no vegetable oil, I'm so saddd
7154 2018-07-28 22:44:44 *had column printed in WaPo, felt smart*

*spent 30 minutes struggling to get oil filter off of car, realized was turning it the wrong way given its awkward placement*

7155 2018-07-28 22:44:43 This article indicates that as a % of population, blacks utilize Medicare at + 3 × rate of that of whites, more in line with % of general pop. 
Similarly there are less immigrants thn whites also, but 50% of households utilize entitlement programs.
7156 2018-07-28 22:44:42 I use lavender essential oil and and organic balm or lotion. Works great
7157 2018-07-28 22:44:31 No matter how many times I wash my work clothes they still smell like oil.
7158 2018-07-28 22:44:26 Trump isn’t responsible for the force protection actions against Russian mercenaries, congressionally mandated sanctions, or business decisions of the oil and gas industry.  Ukraine already had US arms through Eastern Europe. Russians were warned of Syria (empty) airbase strikes.
7159 2018-07-28 22:44:24 I would try the #mayonnaiseicecream it’s just oil egg and lemon. It would probably taste like a creamy French vanilla with a twist. Why is everyone so grossed out about it? Is it because they don’t know what’s in mayonnaise?
7160 2018-07-28 22:44:21 Hahahaha...yes o!  see my hands up. I love to be informed so I can make informed decisions. Reason I've gone and read "Oil,Politics & Violence", "Soldiers of Fortune" (both by Max Siollun) and "Fighting Corruption is Dangerous"
7161 2018-07-28 22:44:17 Excedrin migraine helps. But also mixing lavender essential oil and peppermint essential oil with something to dilute them and rubbing them on your forehead works as well.

7166 2018-07-28 22:43:13 My face is fine today after some rosehip oil!
7167 2018-07-28 22:42:35 I was early on the ZIOH facebook group before @KetoCarnivore but after Danny Roddy. I was one of the Weston A Price kooks (then, my head is on strait now.) I remember @ZeroCarbHealth laughing so hard at my suggestion to add MCT oil! Good times. Be patient with the newbies!
7168 2018-07-28 22:42:28 انتهى نقاشي معك فأنت لست سعودي ولا مسلم أيضا وروح غير اسمك وضع اسمك الحقيقي

7169 2018-07-28 22:42:26 I don't even like bread that much since so many kinds I used to eat made me swell due to soybean oil or soy lecithin. I do occasionally like a hearty veggie sandwich. How do you make your tacos/nachos?
7170 2018-07-28 22:42:24 想像出来てないですが上陸したてってやっぱりやばいんですね。無事なら良かったです。
7171 2018-07-28 22:42:22 Uh oh...I forgot the oil!!! Always forget that while talking.  I made a mixture this months from many different oils. And I add a mixture of herbs.
7172 2018-07-28 22:42:20 Living with your parents: my mom woke me up from a nap to ask me if I use tea tree oil because she found tea tree oil in my bathroom
7173 2018-07-28 22:41:52 Yea, The LORD will answer and say unto His people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith:
I Praise The LORD CHRIST BLESSINGS LORD CHRIST AMEN

7178 2018-07-28 22:41:29 Poison is not Patriotic! 
#EPA we can't keep mandating environmental devastation from corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, we have to invest in #CleanerFuels
Get off of oil and get in the game!
7179 2018-07-28 22:41:25 Tbh oil is. A national resources and in many countries there is petro dollar which means every citizen is owed a sum fo the oil sold. Some countries do it some dont /. Max a citizen could get is around 500$
7180 2018-07-28 22:41:00 if anyone does oil paintings DM me please!
7181 2018-07-28 22:40:59 Wish they'd all be forced to swim through a swimming pool full of Oil if they want to pass this shit.

7183 2018-07-28 22:40:35 (1/2) Many lawns don't need to be mowed as often when it's hot and dry. If you skip cutting this week use some of that saved time to take care of your lawn mower, tractor or ZTR. Down time is a good time for maintenance — checking filters, changing oil and sharpening blades.
7184 2018-07-28 22:40:34 @Basilippo one year of using your olive oil and still in love with it. I am coming to Barcelona next month is there anywhere I can buy your oils especially the orange infused one?
7185 2018-07-28 22:40:22 Remove excess oil…  I don’t do that though
7186 2018-07-28 22:40:12 Biancas , vocês já encontraram ai em Curitiba o "Oil Man" andando de bicicleta pela cidade ?

7188 2018-07-28 22:40:08 風はあるけど穏やか。暴風が建物全体をめっちゃ押してきたし、玄関の扉をうちつける雨、怖かったですね、
7189 2018-07-28 22:39:54 As Bacevich book said, it was Prez Carter making security of the oil in the Middle East a clear priority of the US. this was after the 1972 mid east war and following the 1973 opec oil blockade that Opec used to punish US for supporting Israel in that conflict!

7192 2018-07-28 22:39:28 Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Deputy Cmdr: "If some seek to endanger [our] interests, Iran will also endanger theirs.. When a country threatens Iran and raises the issue that it can block Iran's oil exports if it wants to, Iran's reciprocal threat would be a credible threat."

7198 2018-07-28 22:38:52 Not compilation of data, its the end use/ purpose. Ordinary ppl dont pour over the details they rely on ppl that do to provide summations of what data indicates. More often than not this is skewed by bias of some sort using data as " proof" of a position

7200 2018-07-28 22:38:14 Any personal or patient testimonials or experiences with hemp or CBD oil for anxiety or insomnia? Curious about how effective it can be, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder
7201 2018-07-28 22:38:06 Too bad, too bad, no doubt. And the powerful statesmen (superlative for subservient worms who crawl on their knees before the owners of oil companies and manufacturers of cars, chemicals and plastics) pretend that the problem does not exist.
7202 2018-07-28 22:38:01 I don't see how someone could say HRC is equally bad unless it was over conservative issues such as abortion. Or due to an anti-imperialist ideology that treated HRC as a hawk & Trump as a dove (despite his championing carpet bombing & taking the oil, torture, & military bravado)

7206 2018-07-28 22:37:16 بغض الكفار بغض النظر عن ديانتهم هذا أصل من أصول الإسلام وهو أصل الولاء والبراء 

فنحب المسلمين ونبغض الكافرين لكفرهم بالله عزوجل 

وكوننا نعاملهم فهي مصالح تجارية وسياسية يقدرها ولي الأمر

7207 2018-07-28 22:37:07 I’ve been dedicating this day to my car. I’ve given it an oil change. I washed the car, I’ve washed the carpets inside. Deep cleaned my leather and I’m about to wax it. It’s going to look like a new car once I’m done
7208 2018-07-28 22:37:02 I feel bad for these kids falling for the  oil salesmen out there......If they are making you promises, you might want to reconsider...
7209 2018-07-28 22:36:57 Breathe breathe breathe baby  rub some lavender oil on your wrists & feet with your fingertips. Eat a yummy meal with carbs. Paint your nails. 

Or just let yourself cry if u need to. Nothing wrong with that  I'm here if u need to talk.

7212 2018-07-28 22:36:38 Сонічна зубна щітка. А ще, щоденні процедури oil pulling (не можу перекласти ) з кокосовою олією extra virgin. У мене тільки ці два методи, дуже задоволена з посмішки  Сода, лимонна кислота і т.п. не дієві, а навіть не корисні методи.
7213 2018-07-28 22:36:37 But yeah this CBD oil better work and make me happy.
7214 2018-07-28 22:36:35 It really is... besides the final level and oil ocean
7215 2018-07-28 22:36:24 At least it was a small fix when’s the last time you got an oil change they’re supposed to check coolant levels for you as well
7216 2018-07-28 22:36:10 Basically, if you are an immigrant Muslim in Europe, you can do whatever you please as long as it is your "culture"??
7217 2018-07-28 22:36:10 Is it not possible to find a natural solution? Its not good for your body to be living off of pills. Acupuncture perhaps.... Or cannabis oil?
7218 2018-07-28 22:36:06 ran into some guy from highschool the other day he's starting a small business as an essential oil salesman
7219 2018-07-28 22:35:59 I had so many grand plans today. I was going to get the oil changed, unpack some boxes, organize my closet for school, plan ASA lewks, see Blindspotting, and swiffer.

So far I have eaten an egg and taken a shower.

7232 2018-07-28 22:33:33  didn’t we just kill a bunch of Russians in Syria?
Sell arms to Ukraine?
Increase oil output?
Agree to sell a massive amount of natural gas to the EU?
Enact sanctions against Russia?
All these negatively effect Russia either militarily or economically.
You’ve been lied to.

7234 2018-07-28 22:33:28 Diesel oil is probably more politically accurate.
7235 2018-07-28 22:33:26 My MBP had a known issue at time of manufacture with its display (Staingate). Apple didn’t publicly inform customers of the issue or that they would fix it. I had thought it was oil from my hands. 

I just heard about it but I’m too late as they now charge $575 for fixing it.
7236 2018-07-28 22:33:15 my head is pounding  need a head massage with oil like my nani Ma gives
7237 2018-07-28 22:33:04 Oil........ Mega rich oil producing countries. Using their power to  advance their beliefs.  Without western industry technology and design the Middle East oil producers would be third world countries.
Without their oil we would starve at the most basic level.

7243 2018-07-28 22:32:01 @KellyannePolls kelly we can push our output of oilby 41% extracting OIL from COAL plant . in salyersville KENTUCKY land is ready to be built on this type of plant for free.  natural gas and coal companies want to put all the money up for plant no tax dollars need .

7259 2018-07-28 22:29:44 The money you pay our government goes directly to big pharmaceuticals that a fueling the deadly opioid crisis. When you buy apple products, you are supporting child labor and exploitation. That has in your car? Supporting polluting oil execs... what’s your point?
7260 2018-07-28 22:29:35 Yes, I'm just a tad nervous due to All the other oil and gas outcomes in the last few years.
7261 2018-07-28 22:29:09 Is the oil supply low?
7262 2018-07-28 22:29:00 Government nationalized the oil industry and that fell apart.

Similar situation in Mexico - country took huge foreign loans to exploit newly discovered oil sources, recession hit them with their pants down.

All indirectly because of nationalization of private sector industries.

7266 2018-07-28 22:28:24 So JP is sending his fan base of racist, misogynistic incels to his pretty 26-year-old daughter for some snake oil for a disease that at least half of them most certainly have. Why not just slather her in honey and tie her to a tree in Banff National Park.
7267 2018-07-28 22:28:23 Yeah imagine dopamine doing that!  But if you have any lavender oil it might help to get you down a bit.

7273 2018-07-28 22:27:40 they want more universities, more states, LGs, polytechnics... promise people things like this and they will cheer. if you like show numbers and oil at $10 per barrel. nobody send you. didn't one of the very recent requests for restructuring demand plenty new states?
7274 2018-07-28 22:27:40 Most of the 911 murderers came from Saudi Arabia. Your best buddies. Nothing was done to that nation, no sanctions, no invasion, no nothing. Why? Because of oil?
7275 2018-07-28 22:27:36 Steel is made with coal. Plastic is made with oil. Glass is made with gas. Steel is recycled by melting with coal or gas. Airbags are plastic so made with oil. Tar is oil. Cement is made thermally by gas or coal. Steel is welded/cut with gas. So she is right.

7278 2018-07-28 22:27:16 The "Little" Scottish oil fields you talk about are 96% of the UK oil.
There is no transfer, if Scotland gets independence they are Scottish... The funny thing is, that Scotland doesn't actually need the wealth that these fields contain to survive, Scotland is rich, will survive.
7279 2018-07-28 22:27:07 Possibly some oil for those bearings too?

7282 2018-07-28 22:26:51 Venezuela fell apart, because the profits from oil were spent on social programs instead of reinvested into the economy to build other industries.

They put all their eggs into one basket - they spent their profits on social programs instead economic growth. Gov had no Plan B.
7283 2018-07-28 22:26:34 Whatever signs socialists are holding in 2020, they won't be made in Venezuela. Socialism has so utterly destroyed that country that they have to import oil, even though they have the proven highest oil reserves in the ground. They will not be able to make signs

7286 2018-07-28 22:26:15 Everywhere I go I get asked questions about cannabis  and how to access to CBD oil.

This alone demonstrates that cannabis is an effective medicine.

7291 2018-07-28 22:25:28 1) crashing the power grid on election day would force polling places to reboot their machines. Maybe Russia needs the reboot to hack. 2) crashing the power grid repeatedly for a long time benefits oil because it hurts electric cars and makes gas-powered generators more common.

7296 2018-07-28 22:24:41 An economy is when there's insufficient demand for what people are supplying, and/or insufficient supply for necessities people need.

Example: Venezuela. Too much oil worldwide for Venezuela oil to bring it the profits it did (not enough demand), not enough food (supply).

7342 2018-07-28 22:17:05 If it’s air drying use small amounts of castor oil, my fav is the aloe one . If not you can use more to protect it. But if you’re straightening it my go to oil is coconut miracle oil & it’s super light

marriage is simply not recognized legally but NOTHING prohibits them from calling a random priest to make a purely RELIGIOUS marriage.
it's only illegal if the girls FINDS THE COURAGE to say she is forced
7395 2018-07-28 22:06:17 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.

7396 2018-07-28 22:06:17 Big mistake: my fellow #keto eaters, avoid @Tazikis I asked for olive 0il. The wait staff warned me that their “olive oil” is 80% canola oil. Seriously. They brag that don’t carry butter on their website. Don’t bother, little keto-healthy there. #timetofast
7397 2018-07-28 22:06:07 We will feast on palm oil, that’ll be fun.
7398 2018-07-28 22:06:03 "It was a cold start so there was no oil on the dipstick"

That has to be the most insane thing I've heard when looking at a car at a dealership. WTF.

7404 2018-07-28 22:05:05 Ugh the other day when I got out of the shower I took a soft cloth and gently rubbed excess oil off the pores of my upper chin/under lip area and the next day it was red and inflammed and scabby. I can attest to self care being a lie.
7405 2018-07-28 22:04:59 Ok. All my visa documents are in order. My car got an oil change and my happy ass is in SA for a day and a half. Houston I'll see you on Monday. I hope the Spanish allow me into their country
7406 2018-07-28 22:04:19 salad dressings that aren’t fatty are easy to make: just 1/3 vinegar/acidic of choice and 2/3 oil of choice! (i.e: rice vinegar and sesame oil for an asian salad dressing, or apple cider vinegar and olive oil, or lemon juice and olive oil)
maybe try grains like brown rice quinoa!
7407 2018-07-28 22:04:13 Oh and just bread with olive oil and parm with like... all the wine I had

7414 2018-07-28 22:03:26 I heard that Ibn Saud, the first king of Saudi Arabia, was opposed to drilling for oil because he knew that sudden wealth without having to earn it would be a detriment to the country's development. He was right on the money.

What of Palm oil
7419 2018-07-28 22:02:32 You can’t force something that ain’t meant to be! Like oil & water
7420 2018-07-28 22:02:11 The more press that Sondos Alqattan gets the better. 
People acting like the treatment of domestic workers in the Middle East is some well kept secret!
We bank roll these places' economies w/oil purchases.
Arabian oil isn't worth more than African & Filipino lives #sondosalqattan
7421 2018-07-28 22:02:04 It's like turning an oil tanker, Feargal. It's taking a while but it's happening, hence the reason for this sort of random reaction from @BBC

7432 2018-07-28 22:00:21 U realize the snake oil salesman played you and those like U with their failed dreams and hopes. I feel sorry for you and yours,  know that the pain you are experiencing will slowly diminish. I will add you to y prayer list.
7433 2018-07-28 22:00:17 Good because like British girls being groomed in the thousands, this is another practise that can never be accepted in a civilised country.

7441 2018-07-28 21:58:28 Which is exactly why we moved alot when I was younger... following where the oil boom was.
7442 2018-07-28 21:58:26 Bitcoin is not bad for the environment and I’m tired of seeing this argument. The energy sources used to mine Bitcoin are bad for the environment. The root cause is our reliance on harmful energy sources. Oil needs to GTFO

7450 2018-07-28 21:57:06 Cold noodle salad??? 8U
Or just salad in general?
You could try lean meat like chicken or fish, roasting some veggies with a little bit of season and some olive oil
7451 2018-07-28 21:56:47 People: use fresh mozz and make quick fresh sauce: chop and bring to a boil: tomatoes, one can of tomato paste, salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil, simmer on low for 30 minutes. Layer your eggplant and mozz in the baking pan while sauce is cooking/pre heat oven.

7456 2018-07-28 21:56:10 Imagine for a moment: What if #HomeDepot had a garage bay for oil changes, carried hunting and camping supplies including ammo, and there was a #ChickfilA inside each one?
7457 2018-07-28 21:55:13 My best stab at cooking is throwing a bunch of vegetables in a saucepan with olive oil and grabbing whatever spices are closest to me

7488 2018-07-28 21:51:55 Oh I see.
What about other oil?
I like coconut oil so far, canola oil works fine too.
Why can't they work on producing oil which doesn't affect animals?
& people look for other work.

7505 2018-07-28 21:49:40 @humansunil I started to take full spectrum CBD oil. It's legal. It has minute amounts of thc. I noticed I get agitated after I take it and more anxious. Is that normal? I never had it happen before. I'm not asking for med advise, just curious. Adverse reaction?

7508 2018-07-28 21:49:32 And at least we will stop victimizing prostitutes and they will have better access to medical care. That sector is as lucrative as the Oil and gas sector.
7509 2018-07-28 21:49:26 I don't remember how old I was, like 12 or 13 I think. And, yeah, Lucas Oil is like a half hour from where I live, so I've been there quite a few times. Mostly for sports (football ain't my thing), but one time for a concert.

7525 2018-07-28 21:46:49 It's cheap because of massive supply - large proportion of world's tropical rainforests are now palm oil plantations. Also generally in 3rd world countries where labour is cheap. The problem now though is if demand for palm oil dries up these people will have no work.

7535 2018-07-28 21:45:35 I told my grandparents I needed an oil change. They got me $134 worth of every fluid my car needed done. Then took me to Walmart and bought me new wipers. Like how did I get so lucky to have a family like that

7538 2018-07-28 21:45:26 Hmm. Fish is pretty simple - I usually use salt, pepper, olive oil and some lemon. The salad was a random dump. I do love the @RiverCafeLondon cookbooks though...
7539 2018-07-28 21:45:02 It pisses me off when people say the Middle East just isn’t peaceful by nature.

NO for centuries they were ruled by ONE SOLE LEADER in peace and guess what happened? 

 We found oil in WW1 and went in and broke them up so we could all have some

7568 2018-07-28 21:40:54 Agreed but my guess is Rattie gets the 1st crack and if the kid is smart, he'll grab it & try to ride the wave. If it comes down to it, not sure they turn to Puljujarvi over Rieder to start the year.

7570 2018-07-28 21:40:26 yo ok i had that once and what you do is you need to put droplets of olive oil into your ear daily, to soften the wax up a bit for about a week. then when you're in the shower, you gotta rinse the ear out with water, making sure that your head remains level. it will help!!!!!

7572 2018-07-28 21:40:16 Before 2015 it was well over $90 n it dropped w less than $40 which affected economies which r dependent on oil including Saudi Arabia n Russia. However,these countries had a gud foreign reserve whilst ours was depleted from over $40bn to $29bn, so you've not answered my question

Big bad oil money is nothing by comparison.

And then there are the political goals....
7585 2018-07-28 21:37:58 For soup, cook ground scallions in oil, then simmer with chicken, oregano, chicken broth and asparagus. Top with basil.
7586 2018-07-28 21:37:53 Ouch. Hope it clears up soon! I have skin problems and I would recommend coconut oil. It’s nourishing and anti-bacterial and forms a film to protect your skin. 
7587 2018-07-28 21:37:41 Berle was a comedian sponsored by Big Oil TEXACO. And the rich got that way through using the labor of others. Read history of USA in 1890s when concentrated wealth emerged.

7592 2018-07-28 21:36:27 ‘President ‘ , ‘70 years’? Sh!t. Really feeling sorry for you guys. Do you actually make any bucks out of selling this snake oil propaganda. How about selling adult diapers.
7593 2018-07-28 21:36:26 the worse of it, imho is that even if it says "edible" bleh...you really don't want it in your mouth...coconut oil you taste what you're supposed to taste...
7594 2018-07-28 21:36:10 Just as yerbabuena isn’t the same in every country, palo santo is also a different species. A sliver (touched to a miracle-working relic or statue) is placed in bottles of coconut oil you find at church shrines all over the country. It protects you from the aswang or manananggal.
7595 2018-07-28 21:36:09 Tea tree oil is very potent and can cause redness and irritation when applied directly to the skin. That's why you need to add water. Use a cotton swab to apply on your pimples. Do this twice a day.

7597 2018-07-28 21:36:02 When the lube techs ask me to do an oil change. Hah. Hah. Hah. No
7598 2018-07-28 21:35:48 Ok Good!!!! Yeah I remember that happened now lol but had a moment of panic when I thought your oil was low and you were never gonna check it 
7599 2018-07-28 21:35:36 Tea tree oil
7600 2018-07-28 21:35:24 i just watched an instructional video on focaccia bread. It calls for (my estimate) a whole gallon of oil to make it. And then you eat it with oil and vinegar lol
7601 2018-07-28 21:35:24 Because the left wants it to be cool to kiddie diddle. #Pedogate
7602 2018-07-28 21:35:19 ― use tree oil
It’s well-known for its ability to fight bacteria and reduce skin inflammation. Specifically, tea tree oil helps fight P. acnes and S. epidermidis, two types of bacteria that can cause pimples. Combine one part tea tree oil to nine parts water.
7603 2018-07-28 21:35:16 NOOOOOohhhhhhhhh    lets get peppermint oil in by the lorry load, right now! ! ! #bebrave
7604 2018-07-28 21:35:11 This is nextgen opinion writing.  Not only do you write a brilliant column but you’ve prepackaged the responses for when I share it on Facebook & my progressive friends say “it’s the oil market” or “that’s not real socialism”.  THAT’S added value.

7613 2018-07-28 21:33:53 I've been a proponent of taking the shackles off since game 82 was completed. I was resigned to the fact last season he wasn't going to get a chance at regular top 6 at bats however this upcoming season I hope this changes. I believe wholeheartedly this will be a good thing.

7615 2018-07-28 21:33:02 "Under  her watch, the advisory group drew up elaborate plans.  Consumers would  bring in used motor oil and batteries for recycling.  Suppliers would  reduce the size of their packaging. And Wal-Mart would  build stores with  energy-saving features."
7616 2018-07-28 21:32:59 Thanks to oil and coal for giving civilization the power to advance for the past 150 years. Thanks to @Tesla and other solar power companies for giving us an alternative for the next 1000+.
7617 2018-07-28 21:32:49 This about real estate, oil mining and lumber. The asshats in ‘power’ don’t care about animals. Or what’s right. Or anything good for humanity, the environment or the planet. It’s all greed with them.
7618 2018-07-28 21:32:49 Also found this dope rose water oil. I’m very obsessed with rose water.

7621 2018-07-28 21:32:43 Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough.

I AM GOING TO MY LOCAL BRANCH TO SORT THIS OUT.

Now stop messaging me, or I'm taking steps to get my money out of USBank (which also supported an oil pipeline over human rights) and putting it into a reputable credit union.

7624 2018-07-28 21:32:10 ― stay hydrated
Make sure to drink lots of water. If you’re dehydrated, your body may signal your skin’s oil glands to produce more oil.
7625 2018-07-28 21:32:09 Thanks for tweeting in William, do you think most Guyanese feel the way you do about the oil deal with Exxon Mobil? Why or why not?
7626 2018-07-28 21:32:09 Humans rejected the offer of zero-point energy because it would cause massive unemployment and break big oil.
7627 2018-07-28 21:32:02 Of course they want to promote liberal conversations.  To simplify it - the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Libs get more public attention than conservatives. They've whined so much about FOX even though 99% of other channels are all liberal. So we get 1 channel unless we pay more.
7628 2018-07-28 21:32:02 Just played: Dem A Sprinkle Oil - Assassin

7631 2018-07-28 21:31:46 Big oil users should pay also.
"Big oil" does nothing more than provide a service.  It's the users that are causing your problem.
7632 2018-07-28 21:31:35 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
7633 2018-07-28 21:31:30 Rising oil prices pushed second-quarter profit at Exxon Mobil Corp. up 18 percent to $3.95 billion, but the results Friday fell short of Wall Street expectations, and the shares fell nearly 3 percent.
7634 2018-07-28 21:31:15 Nope. I think we need to spread democracy while making oil companies richer. That’s The American Way! #MAGA #IloveCIA.
7635 2018-07-28 21:31:02 Thanks Michael what other lessons do you think Guyana should take from other countries around the world handling oil resources?
7636 2018-07-28 21:30:58 Sunblock, bug spray, water, valve oil, cork grease, reeds, and don’t wear white shorts or pants lol. Hope y’all have lots of fun and work super hard.
7637 2018-07-28 21:30:18 2. as currently if an immigrant couple were married when they were 16/17 the marriage is accepted as legal. But as the government were already working on it (and have now proposed a new law that should take effect Jan 1st 2019 and would remove this exception), they voted no.

7639 2018-07-28 21:30:10 Frankly,
I don't like palm oil nor need it.
So I do avoid it.
I was trying to get back-up as to why/why not to do to get a strong base.
Somehow palm-oil is used in most packet food which doesn't even need it, which is why perhaps leading to the unnecessary damage.

7642 2018-07-28 21:30:00 Thanks Zephryn, what are you hearing from Guyanese you are speaking to about the prospect of an oil boom in the country?
7643 2018-07-28 21:29:16 I hate the kids one but I love that!
7644 2018-07-28 21:29:14 1. They are claiming that the government parties voted FOR child marriages, which is not true. There was a proposition from the opposition that the government should look into strengthening laws against child marriages
7645 2018-07-28 21:29:11 Can't remember the year but I believe Rexi remained on their protected list until Lowe removed him during one of his years as general manager. Pretty funny stuff...especially since the Oilers managed to use the loophole to their advantage to the extent they did.
7646 2018-07-28 21:29:10 Thanks for tweeting Kemba, why are you glad we are doing this topic and what questions do you have about the oil deal in Guyana?
7647 2018-07-28 21:28:56 who stuff m80s up a butt and tempts fate?
what is fate?
can fate fit a narrative?

7649 2018-07-28 21:28:27 Yes oil up with USD = EM destruction.  which leads to DM destruction. 
7650 2018-07-28 21:28:25 My sister and I are going with my mom to get her oil changed and she said “If y’all are good I will get y’all ice cream” 
7651 2018-07-28 21:28:20 Ah when the wind hits just right you can smell the oil from the metro escalators and you just know you’re about to take your life in your own hands.
7652 2018-07-28 21:28:13 We're sorry to hear this! Dreamtime luxury bath oil has a melt warning on our website. It should harden back up in the fridge and you'll still be able to enjoy it in the bath!
7653 2018-07-28 21:27:58 Socialism is the argument that production belongs collectively to the workers. Venezuela never did that - the government just took over the oil industry and ran it into the ground because of mismanagement and corruption.

Not only does oil-prone skin need hydration, 
but adding oil can actually help the
skin produce less oil in the long run.
7657 2018-07-28 21:26:53 SAP was the buzz phrase of that era. #Nigerians finally realised that 70s oil boom was over and could not last forever. The balling champagne lifestyle was curtailed. #NaijaHistory

7664 2018-07-28 21:26:00 Rudy Giuliani is a clown who should be disbarred, but anybody who thinks he is destroying Trump’s case is not paying attention.

The deplorables have already shown they are gullible enough to swallow any snake oil Trump and his enablers have to offer.
7665 2018-07-28 21:25:52 ― moisturize skin 
Moisturizers help make skin hydrated. The fragrance-free or noncomedogenic moisturizers are the best. The moisturizers that contain oil, synthetic fragrance, or other ingredients can cause pimples.
7666 2018-07-28 21:25:39 My brother in law has a garden. Damn tomatoes are the size of softballs. Slice em up,a little salt,olive oil and great Jersey made bread.
7667 2018-07-28 21:25:35 Maybe politico is unaware that #childmarriage is #CHILDABUSE & therefore tends to be #illegal throughout the EU & western world? Just appalling journalism once again if they think this is anything but an issue EVERYONE should be working to stop.
7668 2018-07-28 21:25:00 Still early days mate but seems to help like. Might try the oil under my tongue instead.

7679 2018-07-28 21:22:44 I know the US consumes alot of oil. I'm pretty sure trucking, and civilian travel out pace us military consumption. Since the army is just about little over one million people if you count reserve and national guard.

7691 2018-07-28 21:21:13 I agree you're right. The oil industry was properly maintained from the day one.
7692 2018-07-28 21:20:52 Then your going to kill people by the scam saying cbd works. My friends father died by a scam oil maker saying was thc oil and it was hemp cbd tincture. Stop promoting for healing qualities.

7696 2018-07-28 21:20:14 By supporting HB331 #akleg on the left side prioritized the fiscal interests of some oil co's over Alaska's. They claim "but Alaska promised". We didn't; the #akleg was just gullible. Challengers are on the right. We will be supporting some. We shouldn't retain gullible #akleg.
7697 2018-07-28 21:20:01 Norway has the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund with assets over $1T USD.  Most was derived from oil.   It was previously named Norway Petroleum Fund. $175K per citizen.  Sure, they’re real socialists.

7699 2018-07-28 21:19:23 Until their oil industry collapsed. It was the vast majority of the country's exports - without oil their economy imploded. Things worsened when Chávez died and Nicolás Maduro took over with an authoritarian regime prompting sanctions. Their economy has continued to worsen (2/2)

7705 2018-07-28 21:18:34 What has "already happened"? It is fake news that the government would somehow endorse child marriages, or be against strengthening laws against it.

7711 2018-07-28 21:18:00 Story time: I could have had the heir to a middle eastern oil company, homeboy used to pull up to campus in an AMG with foreign plates

I didn’t clock that he was trying to move to me & I slept on him 

He graduated this week

7712 2018-07-28 21:17:59 Off work 1st Stop oil changeD, car washed
7713 2018-07-28 21:17:57 That was their money. It wasn't our money to begin with. And why do you think they scream death to America. America put them under control of the shah. Look that up. They had a democracy until we had to but in so we could get cheap oil. I know my history you obviously don't
7714 2018-07-28 21:17:45 UK North Sea oil peaked in 1999. We really squandered that one. It makes sense that they're selling it off to someone who's prepared to try and scrape the barrel. Worldwide, this is happening which is rather telling, & it won't stem the tide of depletion noticeably.
7715 2018-07-28 21:17:21 Got off work at 2 then went to my local @Toyota dealership waiting on my car to be serviced for an oil change & tire rotation...flash forward 2 hrs later still not done. This is what I get for coming on a saturday & I'm frickin starving! #hungry #dealership #Toyota
7716 2018-07-28 21:17:07 My question is, why run a pipeline from Niger Republic to Nigeria when the crude could have been refined over there? It's just a honest question...
7717 2018-07-28 21:16:55 I always wondered about those old time folks who got taken in by snake oil salesmen. Now I know.
7718 2018-07-28 21:16:46 A while back their former president Hugo Chávez reformed much of the country under the banner of socialism - in reality he took over the country's oil industry while implementing socialistic policies. The policies worked pretty well to bring people out of poverty (1/2)

7721 2018-07-28 21:15:53 Nobody really knows - outside Top Secret circles - just how much oil KSA has left, but they've been stating the same amount of reserves for decades without reflecting production, ie extraction, into the figures. Shell had to downgrade because they were found out though.

7753 2018-07-28 21:11:48 So make more road pigs, forget about a greener planet and line the oil industry pockets. Another stellar plan by old man Trump, who seems to be stuck in the 50's. Palm to head.
7754 2018-07-28 21:11:31 that's a fair point, just one that has more to do with global oil prices than anything having to do with the way the country was organized economically (clearly neither of which she understands)
7755 2018-07-28 21:11:23 We got onto it too late . Wether people like it or not it’s why the mancs overtook us and have been able to outspend us for god knows how long . It’s either that or an oil barren . We’ve got the fanbase to not go that way to be fair
7756 2018-07-28 21:11:03 Hello!do you buy oil fields?
7757 2018-07-28 21:11:00 During the first quarter of 2007, the Company reclassified its downstream oil and gas business, Lummus Global (Lummus), to discontinued operations based on management's decision to sell that business.

7805 2018-07-28 21:02:50 I washed my hair and added oil it’s definitely not itching anymore like it was 
7806 2018-07-28 21:02:44 No. I was doing well before, I'm doing about the same now. I'm pretty sure life has improved for some but nothing noticable for myself. My tax cut is almost entirely eaten up by high oil and medical cost.
7807 2018-07-28 21:02:32 Jaloers op de cd- kast, supervet! Oil on canvas, zóó mooi, eneh tussen al het zessnarenwerk ...1P-Bass Fender ?
7808 2018-07-28 21:02:28 She was 3 when Harry Reid stood on floor of Senate speaking in favor of abolishing birthright citizenship.
7809 2018-07-28 21:02:22 What about the sludge now allowed in the rivers again? The coal and oil companies got got their penalties removed. Poison can flow into the Potomac River again, but today's 1st world 15min problem topic on Twitter is Twitter.
7810 2018-07-28 21:01:54 ...Perhaps he can offer him a body rub with scented oil... So long as he said that it was just oil.
7811 2018-07-28 21:01:52 We need a way to nationalize corporations that work against progress to maintain the status quo and their profits. We can then phase them out at taxpayer's expense. Oil and gas as an example.
7812 2018-07-28 21:01:48 So an oil change turned into a $200 trip to jiffy lube  I’m not in the mood
7813 2018-07-28 21:01:43 You’re the one who talked about oil in response to mercenary attack, saying nothing could hurt Russia more. Now you say I’m conflating two different issues.This is like alternate reality world.
7814 2018-07-28 21:01:22 I went to buy some fresh basil to make caprese salad & all they had was massive bundles, so I'm going to infuse some olive oil 
7815 2018-07-28 21:01:02 Ya ain't wrong!
7816 2018-07-28 21:00:46 Mix 4 tsps Cantaloupe with 11 lbs kiwi. Blend with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with salmon
7817 2018-07-28 21:00:46 This business proposal sounds nice but it fails to tell us who's funding the construction of the refinery? 
@efa101 are you aware?
7818 2018-07-28 21:00:35 Suggest coalition of all orgs. that protect animals, birds, waters, air, soil, forestry, etc. be formed immediately; flood Congress with appropriate info, demand hearings, with heavy emphasis on election year. Put similar pressures on oil companies!
7819 2018-07-28 21:00:27 If U scroll back on my TL earlier today I RT'd a tweet that demonstrates Democrats join Republicans in congress to drill oil/gas on public lands. They are demonstrably no better than the "loyal opposition." Today's Democrats and Republicans are working together to screw US!
7820 2018-07-28 21:00:26 Hey sweety! Tea tree oil can heal those acts up real quick. You are love! Focus and Look within ..

7823 2018-07-28 21:00:13 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
7824 2018-07-28 21:00:10 Idk if I could call them subtle... Lol. True though.
7825 2018-07-28 21:00:08 I’ll get the baby oil ready 
7826 2018-07-28 21:00:04 This govt is full of lies & deceit. They want to take the oil, plunder and pollute the land that produces it then use the ploy of cattle colonies to enslave and colonize the owners of the oil. How does one harvest or lay claim to what isn't in his backyard?
7827 2018-07-28 20:59:47 The oil change guy and I both know I’ve lost a lot of leverage in the negotiations by being seven months overdue for the appointment. We’re going thru the motions but I’ll be driving out of here with a new cabin air filter.
7828 2018-07-28 20:59:45 So I get my oil changes on the west of 8 mile ... this guy found me on Facebook and tried to shoot his shot .. so I waited like months to go back thinking it'll be someone different .. it's the same guy  #akwardddd
7829 2018-07-28 20:59:29 You are talking about our oil money when you take money from companies linked to terrorists and I'm thick? What is wrong with Oil Money by the way you haven't said?
7830 2018-07-28 20:59:27 You realize that a massive of taxes is not going to those services... right? It’s going to mass surveillance, blood for oil wars, war on drugs, war on terror, war on the poor, war on blacks, Goldman Sachs, General Motors, Corporate Socialism, assassination of American citizens,
7831 2018-07-28 20:59:27 That's such a subtly sexy approach.

I can't speak for all Men, but simple elegant private selfies are a ridiculous, emotional turn on!
7832 2018-07-28 20:59:23 I'm joking, your lavender oil tweet lol xxx
7833 2018-07-28 20:59:23 I gave caffeine up cold turkey about a year ago - it was messing with my heart rhythm. I took Advil and CBD oil for the searing headache.
7834 2018-07-28 20:59:19 I kinda want to sell the oil paints i bought bc i know that i won't use them.. but idk how so oh well
7835 2018-07-28 20:58:51 I’ve heard by mechanics that they have so many services to do in day and if there done prop they don’t get them done , so all they do is top up fluids and send them back out , the beauty of fully synthetic oil
7836 2018-07-28 20:58:39 Listen I literally came home scrubbed my bathroom. Put clothes away. Hung up new shower curtains and lit the oil burners in both my room and the bathroom and ended with a bath. I may be truly stepping into my Virgoness.
7837 2018-07-28 20:58:24 Exactly!
7838 2018-07-28 20:58:12 Prices at the pump went up 0.5% last month after advancing 1.7% in May and jumping 3% in April. Gasoline prices soared 24.3% from June 2017. The broader index for energy, which combines items like gasoline, electricity and fuel oil, retreated 0.3% in June after rising 0.9%
7839 2018-07-28 20:58:03 Hey, remember when Desantis working hard to save Florida's tourism and fishing industries after the BP oil spill.  Oh wait, that was Adam Putnam!!!!!  Thank you!!!!!!!!
7840 2018-07-28 20:58:03 Thanks  a lot.  I thought the opposite would happen, if you set a higher correlation threshold you would get more clusters with less connections, ie. more of the "oil and prices" connections but less total connections.  If you set a low correlation threshold it turns intoa circle
7841 2018-07-28 20:57:48 @DocTucson  If 4.1% GDP & defeating ISIS & record low unemployment & rising wages & strengthening our military & being the worlds largest oil producer & peace in Korea is ALL BAD NEWS what exactly is @theDempcrats platform?

7848 2018-07-28 20:57:10 very good coconut oil is definitely good for the cooch...enjoy! I've used just coconut, but it does require reapplication if you need *cough* endurance (read: toying or your man has endurance)
7849 2018-07-28 20:57:09 Yessss, I do that and then put witch hazel on my face and coconut oil for moisture. It really do help, it work fast too just stay consistent.
7850 2018-07-28 20:56:48 My truck has this awesome feature in which it allows me to my oil changes every 7-8k miles instead of 3-4k miles. It burns it  so I'm always adding new oil 
7851 2018-07-28 20:56:46 I dont want oil on my seafood. Wtf?
7852 2018-07-28 20:56:42 I started putting coconut oil in my smoothies and man 
7853 2018-07-28 20:56:38 Ground fenugreek seeds mixed with amla oil, castor oil and vitamin E, rub it into your scalp maybe twice a week, cover with a shower cap (I sleep in it) and then shampoo/cond as normal. Helps with hair fall and supports lactation too:)
7854 2018-07-28 20:56:36 The Yemeni Shebaq Al-Turkish newspaper, published a report on the allocation of Saudi Arabia for 16 thousand square kilometers of the tanks of oil and gold oil and the gold, for the Zionist entity, air and ground air and their use of the entity of the chemical storage area !!
7855 2018-07-28 20:56:12 Why yall “chefs”(I use that term loosely) keep tryna pass that oil off as butter???
7856 2018-07-28 20:56:00 The best part of this is the issue is with Democrats but they start the story out “far right.....”
7857 2018-07-28 20:55:51 A fair portion of the pics on my phone are just for Noah lol
7858 2018-07-28 20:55:38 May require a slightly deceptive approach similar to  " moderate Democrats?" Dems have employed this in red /purple areas successfully in some cases
7859 2018-07-28 20:55:28 Venezuela is one of the riches countries in the WORLD in oil..

California taxpayers are flocking out of State while the Governor protects Felon illegal aliens. House prices are going through the roof because they've destroyed the middle class with taxes, while Tents fill SF,LA

7866 2018-07-28 20:54:08 Ah, I see. A TelePrompTer read speech about oil policy bests the attack of US soldiers. And that speech came before the attack

7869 2018-07-28 20:53:22 How much money have you taken from Russian Oil moguls?
7870 2018-07-28 20:53:08 I think I see roads/auto/oil industry as being sort of the same as that. They're now built & here, but they once did what you describe that "safety" building abt to do. Now things are changing, in part b/c roads & cars became what ppl depend on so much that now they're too full.
7871 2018-07-28 20:53:04 Probably. The whole crusades era narratives used by anti-Muslim charlatans aren't dependent on oil or modern geopolitics. There's enough historical "clash of civilizations" framing for bigots to find a way. Probably less virulent, but I think it'd still exist.
7872 2018-07-28 20:52:58 @fcagroup Jeep owners in France please check your oil change by Jeep garages as they may have made a big mistake on the correct oil! @JeepFrance @JeepCareFR  @Jeep.  My engine is broken at only 66,000 km
7873 2018-07-28 20:52:47 Sure she is as corrupt as Donald Trump She was indicted for obstructing investigation into the 1994 AMIA Bombingwhich killed 85 people, She allegedly was making a deal to stop investigating Iranian officials  involved in the attack in exchange for better prices on Iranian oil.
7874 2018-07-28 20:52:47 I'd make a pretty safe guess it smells like stale air, BO, and oil.
7875 2018-07-28 20:52:33 In all fairness....we did kinda rat fuck their leaders in the interest of oil....granted their leaders were and are shit....i feel the same way about the Saudis too
7876 2018-07-28 20:52:25 That was Rs.400 arb Oil prices was 110 $ / barrel before negotiating with power companies. By now debts of electricity is Rs. 1000 arb & Oil prices was Rs. 40 $ / barrel between 2014- 2017. Where is the money which was saved due to Oil price .....Where that money went..........
7877 2018-07-28 20:52:24 Want a really good body oil
7878 2018-07-28 20:52:23 It's something else man. Lot of oil tho lool
7879 2018-07-28 20:52:21 Obama never could? Under Obama  unemployment dropped from 11% to under 5%, stock market at all time high, home prices soared, poverty down, 15 million+ insured, health premiums increased at half the rate as under GWB, violent crime down significantly, US oil production doubled.

7882 2018-07-28 20:51:54 Romania nationalizes its oil fields. Many believe this will finally bring back the German's bloodthirst in a search for new sources of black gold.
7883 2018-07-28 20:51:43 What was the alternative fate for the oil?
7884 2018-07-28 20:51:40 Build the f-ing wall now.  Oil the top of it real well.
7885 2018-07-28 20:51:36 I use coconut oil.. 
7886 2018-07-28 20:50:53 So the next war on oil will be another American civil war then.
7887 2018-07-28 20:50:47 One of those two was qualified to be president and wasn’t a narcissistic liar and cheat.  And one of them is a snake oil salesman and serial liar without a solid grasp on his own language and zero intellectual curiosity.
7888 2018-07-28 20:50:44 Black and white filters are essential to everything
7889 2018-07-28 20:50:37 62M voted for Trump.  Reading the 18months of polls, about half of them will lose faith and give up on him if there are indictments of his inner circle. The real question is what to do with the other ~30M who remain sold on his snake oil, even after the indictments hit the fan?
7890 2018-07-28 20:50:29 I cook with toothpaste instead of oil so I don't have to brush my teeth after I eat. #wishyoudthoughtofit

7901 2018-07-28 20:49:13 Trump calls Canada a closed economy because we have a 375% diary Tariff. *facepalm* Forget about the BILLIONS in cheap oil shipments, gas, cars, technology, trading relationship worth $800 Billion two ways and US has a SURPLUS with Canada.

7942 2018-07-28 20:43:59 Midnight beauty serum has such a pleasent smell, that I enjoy making my night beauty treatment every day. Not just the smell, aboundant oil mixture made my skin better in just one month of using it. Thx Flower and Spice.

7952 2018-07-28 20:42:40 I am having a hard time seeing how a plan to increase fuel use by 500,000 barrels a day is good for anyone,  except of course the big oil companies. By undoing all the gains we have made in efforts to use less oil Trump is doing great harm. To our nation and world.

7955 2018-07-28 20:42:01 @XavierTmccloud I put oil in it. Since had it changed and it's been fine. I got it in dec.
7956 2018-07-28 20:41:58 That is begging to be dipped in some olive oil.
7957 2018-07-28 20:41:56 spending extra time on my swollen manhood she ensures that every inch is coated in the thick warm oil until she is perfectly content in what she has accomplished she smiles softly as she peels all her clothes except for thigh high stockings and bends over to tease me.*

7961 2018-07-28 20:41:16 Surely it should be in Olive Oil. Sorry !!
7962 2018-07-28 20:41:04 And if it comes down to it, if I can’t change it, if I can’t make things better, I’ll expose it. I’ll help it crumble to make way for what is necessary.

People need help and are sold snake oil and lies with smiles and good intentions.

That’s a little hyperbolic, but you get me.

7966 2018-07-28 20:40:21 FYI- if you ever need a fast remedy for bites, Lavender oil! It took the sting right out. It was still swollen for a couple of hours but that slowly went down as well. It’s magic!
7967 2018-07-28 20:40:13 It depends on the oil, but they can offer some help. The best effect beyond aroma therapy is that some can help against bacteria, but they can also make it worse. Beyond that it’s pretty much nothing but phony doctors and expensive pyramid schemes.

8015 2018-07-28 20:34:43 Thanks so much for this! This spring I pulled up buckets of chickweed at the organic farm where I worked; I wanted to try a fresh oil infusion but was concerned about moisture. I thought dry-wilting and a double boiler infusion would be safest, but wasn't sure.

8081 2018-07-28 20:24:44 Politicians have a choice.  Fix healthcare.  Fix the environment.  feed the poor.   Or make oil men obscenely rich.  The voters have a choice too.

8085 2018-07-28 20:23:51 Hi @POLITICOEurope the fact that you even THINK that this is up for 'debate' is the problem. Sane, moral people oppose child marriage. Amoral fanatical ideologues try to defend it. Hope this enlightens you.

8089 2018-07-28 20:22:42 I just heard “I Will Follow You Into the Dark,” by Deathcab for Cutie in a Wal-Mart as I was purchasing motor oil and I’m pretty sure I’m dead now and this is my own personal prison.

I don't need to belong to a tribe in order to be aware of what's going on  in the world.  My advice for you is a simple one, turn off TV
8102 2018-07-28 20:21:19 I hate the smell of tea tree oil... but shit works wonders 
8103 2018-07-28 20:21:18 i lost a bet to sam and had to drink a spoonful of oil and FUCK my throat feels so greasy
8104 2018-07-28 20:21:14 2/ What is there to study? Any who would put concerns about integration and other cultures ahead of the welfare of a child is an awful human being. Same with anyone who is accepting that position and supporting a political party that would do that.
8105 2018-07-28 20:21:06 this whole thing about calling ur dad for anything related to your car is SO TRUE. I went to o’reilly’s for oil and a filter bc their ad has an offer and they str8 up told me not for the oil weight that i get for my car like... wtf. my papa bout to roll up lol
8106 2018-07-28 20:20:39 I am confident that tRump would not have a base without the fascist evangelical leaders. They all sell their lies that tRump was chosen by God, which is the most pathetic lie I have ever heard. They are nothing but snake oil salesmen preying on the ignorant. Makes me sick.

8121 2018-07-28 20:19:01 NO< NO> Not the people. They ARE starving!! It's the leadership...I use that word loosely...that is to blame. Our engineers went down there in 1948, and got the oil out of the ground for them!!  They owe us!!

8129 2018-07-28 20:18:38 yes that shit tastes like they mixed it with vegetable oil or some shit
8130 2018-07-28 20:18:38 *I come back and light some little candles, put on some new age atmosphere music, and put the oil in the warmer.*  Antonio?  even though I'm going slow, I promise you will feel more energetic by the time I'm done. *I lay a sheet over your legs and butt*  drink water after.
8131 2018-07-28 20:18:31 Oil price in 2015 was $40 now it's $72..will you still say it has fallen?
Our foreign reserves in May 2015 was at $29.6bn...so how was it depleted
In 3 years can you name projects he has started and completed or will you blame it on oil/foreign reserves.
8132 2018-07-28 20:18:30 You never know how many filters your vehicle has until you go get an oil change..  They be wanting to change out everything and charge you for it!! 
8133 2018-07-28 20:18:29 Iran's payments received from the sale of oil...worldwide.
8134 2018-07-28 20:18:13 Unpopular opinion: Ciara may have a lot of voluminous hair, but it never looks shiny or healthy. It's naturally thick and as a result, very dry and coarse, like steel wool. Someone give her some coconut oil, stat. #days
8135 2018-07-28 20:18:12 6) Where does the capital come from?
Loans, from Banks, Machinery Co's, gov't agencies etc. $$ from sale of land next to cities, $$ from oil mineral rights, $$ from other businesses owned by farmer, off shore $$, $$ from land rental corps.
Renting land also requires less capital.
8136 2018-07-28 20:17:54 ...just in time for the election....he's also draining down the national reserve of oil so gasoline will be cheaper before the election....Wait until December!

8138 2018-07-28 20:17:29 ‘Merica First!    The MAGA crowd is being played by this snake oil salesmen.  He says one thing but does another.  They are blinded and don’t realize they are in a cult at this point.   Sometime I pity them, then I remember these folks were attracted by his phobic speech to start
8139 2018-07-28 20:17:16 Yes he has oil rights in the Artic..arranged by the former SOS Tillerson.but Obama blocked Drilling there and no matter how much #Trump has tried he hasn't been able to lift it..#Putin not happy
8140 2018-07-28 20:17:01 Judging by the look on this mechanic’s face, asking for an oil change at 1pm on a Saturday is like walking into a restaurant at closing time and asking for a table for 12.
8141 2018-07-28 20:16:59 Venezuela (oil rich) is figuring it out now

8144 2018-07-28 20:16:17 IBB in particular. The expansion of government under him was quite something. Whole agencies created to ‘pacify’ people. Story of one oil billionaire today Who became one simply because IBB was looking for someone from Kwara to give an oil block for ‘balance’
8145 2018-07-28 20:15:52 Someone is trying to do that currently with CBD oil lol

8148 2018-07-28 20:15:34 Glider kits - no big deal unless you are Fitzgerald Industries. they can't find enough people to drive the trucks that don't emit pollutants.

8153 2018-07-28 20:14:45 The smoke form burning Kuwaiti oil fields, or California forests and the ash from volcanic eruptions have a much larger and measurable "greenhouse" effect that infinitesimal increases in a particular gas - one that's quickly recaptured by plants anyway...
8154 2018-07-28 20:14:42 One time I didn’t know I needed to get my oil changed until Coach Self told me to bc I was 27,000 miles over......
8155 2018-07-28 20:14:37 Frankee let me off early! Time to get a nap and head over to get an oil change later. 
8156 2018-07-28 20:13:59 Plus, upward pressure on oil prices from more demand which will make Russia happy. I’m waiting for him to propose tax credits for coal-powered trucks.
8157 2018-07-28 20:13:49 A New Yorker myself, just couldn't resist. Lol. In my estimation, they're just a couple of schmucks. Snake oil salesmen...regardless of geography...still love your comments though.

8161 2018-07-28 20:13:01 Another reason Dog Ford wants us to burn more candles and use whale oil lamps. How do you expect rich people to enjoy the lavish lives they deserve if the middle class and working poor keep hogging all the lectricity?
8162 2018-07-28 20:13:01 This bill is outrageous. I live in Florida. I am so tired of the stupid, greedy, self-serving legislature and governor in power. We have enough problems and embarrassments without these egomaniacs creating more. So, which ones have ties to Big Oil?
8163 2018-07-28 20:12:58 YHERES THIS ONE OIL THAT I USE SO I DONY GET BURNED ONLY TAN LEMME FIND IT HOLD ON
8164 2018-07-28 20:12:55 When y’alls sensor comes on saying you need an oil change, how long do y’all still ride before you get the oil changed?
8165 2018-07-28 20:12:54 Correction, oil hasnt returned to the stratosphere IN ALBERTA. It's very high in the US, Europe, south america, Asia and Africa.  Basically anywhere that doesnt hamstring its own industries is getting fair value for their resources.
8166 2018-07-28 20:12:53 This is because Niger republic is land locked,and the Crude will be sourced from Niger republic, transported and refined in Katsina,this is a bilateral agreement, which will benefit both countries,and make products supply  available nationwide.

8169 2018-07-28 20:12:25 Yes, I will seek persons with cancer and offer to administer a 72-day cancer cure using 60 grams of pure extracted cannabis oil, the only cost will be the wholesale cost of the 60 grams ( requiring approximately 550-650 grams of cannabis flower to be extracted), about $2,400 CN.

8174 2018-07-28 20:11:50 her skin did look really healthy (and still does), facetune can only go so far so i think her pics were legit. but...wtf was actually in the product??? she could have just gotten a chemical peel and then sold snake oil or w/e because the "ingredients" made no sense.
8175 2018-07-28 20:11:48 I lost my satellite lock some time ago :( Don't know where I am now and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
8176 2018-07-28 20:11:40 Just for clarification.
I stopped purchasing products which said "palm oil" unless there is mention of trying not to exploit, like @Earth_Balance. 
I noticed there was margarine labelled vegan but had palm oil.
My mom said it only affects orangutans in Malaysia not Canada.
Thots?
8177 2018-07-28 20:11:37 @elonmusk I don't know if you can, but maybe try to get a hold of at least one of the Hungarian #BigWinds. The repurposed tanks with Russian MiG 15 engines on them designed to fight oil field fires in the Gulf.

8182 2018-07-28 20:11:12 Apply coconut oil every night on the lashes as long in as possible and sleep whit it over the night. I have test it my self and it’s works!
8183 2018-07-28 20:11:12 Well maybe they should start with the middle east OPEC has been making billions of dollars on oil since its inception and they send all of their "refugees" (terrorists)  to other countries to support them.
8184 2018-07-28 20:11:11 Moonrocks are the caviar of Marijuana. The buds are then dipped in hash oil and sprinkled with kief. That’s right, stoners, the holy trinity. Bud, hash oil, and kief, all in one delicious product.

8186 2018-07-28 20:10:46 Im smug because I ride a bicycle?  Lol.  Yeah. I’m a grandma and I want to keep in shape and not be dependent on oil if I can. 

Do you.
8187 2018-07-28 20:10:32 Just one more reason why Dog Ford wants to return to the good old days of coal and oil. Green energy is just too darn clean!
8188 2018-07-28 20:10:20 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
8189 2018-07-28 20:10:17 Economy best since 2014! Nowhere near the best yet! Much of the boost is one off input to avoid tariffs & oil sale increases! Doubt it will last for long. Boast when you have 2 years of GDP growth @ an average 3.9% & above. Best of luck v China in trade nego as u owe $bs to them!

8192 2018-07-28 20:09:42 I love the picture. You should stare at it for a while, you will see the beauty. When you let the oil companies come in you are ruining the land. Your name is Judas and you are getting those gold coins for selling out the people you represent.
8193 2018-07-28 20:09:24 Tea tree oil is my best friend. Pimple? Tea tree oil. Rash? Tea tree oil. Moody?.. Tea tree oil.

He suggested I start trying CBD edibles, oil etc.. to help manage my pain & hopefully ween me off pain meds

8204 2018-07-28 20:07:29 I think...adjective or occupation, one word, she's a hellcat of a woman; he's a hellcat, a guy who works on oil rigs. Location of actual origin, two words, he's a Hell cat, a fiery feline straight outta the 3rd circle of Hell.
8205 2018-07-28 20:07:24 A whole generation of elites is governed by the prebendal cake sharing paradigm. It's pan-Nigerian&transcends ethnic, creedal&partisan lines. It's their understanding of how to run Nigeria. Raw politics without any interest in productivity or economics. To them, oil is infinite.
8206 2018-07-28 20:07:10 If you just take the example of Norway and oil (albeit simplistic), the USA has about 5 times Norway's oil reserves but 62 times its population. Even so, GDP per capita is only a bit higher there (70k vs 57k)

8229 2018-07-28 20:03:37 I mean like grilling in the oven. Feel similar results could be accomplished if the meat is wrapped in thick foil/parchment paper without oil and placed in a oven so the steam cooks it? Mmn not sure if the word would be grilling. But still healthier than frying anyways

-Was it Buhari that prevented Nigeria from saving during the oil boom?
-Was it Buhari that made the Nigerian economy to be oil dependent?
-Was it Buhari that depleted our foreign reserves?

8246 2018-07-28 20:01:19 10 cents a litre savings in gas is a joke at this point. The crooked gas stations raise and lower it more than that in the same day.

8255 2018-07-28 20:00:07 So to answer your question, a hyper-politicized environment with poorly developed institutions, a repressed civil society&authoritarians in charge naturally gave rise to decisions&policies utterly disconnected from economic considerations. After all, we're an oil rich nation.

8262 2018-07-28 19:58:59 Agree that RNH is a good C/a playmaker and might be needed in some games in the middle. If oilers is able to find a good combo for Drai at the beginning of the season->RNH can stay with McD. Surely Todd will use all possible combinations and we will see your duo sooner or later.
8263 2018-07-28 19:58:52 The Isle of Grain in Kent is somewhere you can really think. It's off the grid, despite The National Grid having a huge plant there. I took my Wilco thermos, sandwiches, a book, and watched oil tankers leaving the Thames Estuary and dropping over the eastern horizon.

8296 2018-07-28 19:54:15 Think of the Nigerian system as a welfare system that distributes oil rents as broadly as possible with ethno-regional elites as the primary beneficiaries&custodians that oversee trickles and crumbs flowing downwards to the people. I call it rentier welfarism.

8310 2018-07-28 19:52:15 Just have done. I’m a little bit gutted with myself to be honest. I should have known that you ‘new’ football fans know fuck all about football or respect.

8315 2018-07-28 19:51:55 Yes or just let a bunch of warlords fight like in Libya. So much easier to control than a country with a healthy educated population. Can just make separate deals with the warlords for the oil. Less overheads.

8316 2018-07-28 19:51:52 Real curious to see what they do w/ Puljujarvi to start the year. Bob keeps hinting at leaving him w/ Strome on the 3rd line but I hope to god they don't go that route. Time to take the reins off the kid and see what he can do.

8328 2018-07-28 19:50:16 Not grilling per se. More like steaming for vegetables. For meat, you don't add oil. It extracts oil from the meat and uses that to fry it. When I tried it, the chicken tasted a bit too raw for my palate...

8335 2018-07-28 19:49:45 I shouldnt be surprised honestly, Canada has massive oil and coal deposits, no one is immune to greed. This is so disturbing, and hope he doesnt remain in his office. A gas tax was recently placed here in Cali and I feel its going to get repealed VERY soon.

8344 2018-07-28 19:49:15 Playing the two together for a stretch of games isn't a problem and should be expected. RNH is still their best all around C and at times they will need to lean on that skill-set.
8345 2018-07-28 19:49:12 They know 93/97 works. You can always go back to that. 

But if you start 27/29 together and it doesn’t work then you open up the conversation for Lucic on L3. All those negative vibes creep in.

8347 2018-07-28 19:48:50 Este muchachito Iguacel sabe algo del tema? Es todo lo contrario a Aranguren.   Juan Jo hablaba poco y hacia mucho, este se la pasa hablando pero se nota que no conoce sobre oil and gas
8348 2018-07-28 19:48:39 We do not need to drill for more oil. 
8349 2018-07-28 19:48:35 Snake oil and/or another one where the dogs get to hang out 
8350 2018-07-28 19:48:30 Hmmm it's hard to pick just one but probably Drift. The fact he went from being one of the most violent decepticons to having the personality of a Facebook mom who teaches yoga and constantly blogs about coconut oil and crystals makes me love him so much 
8351 2018-07-28 19:48:13 Do you really get satisfaction out of watching a race like this? I don't deny his talent like some but man that victory is as hollow as an empty oil drum.
8352 2018-07-28 19:48:08 Fresh oil change 
8353 2018-07-28 19:47:59 Changed the oil in my cars.. groovy 
8354 2018-07-28 19:47:53 It boggles my mind that he’s even a necessary point of view to have to argue against anyone with. I feel as though I’m having to convince people that snake oil is a scam. Which... I think I he even sells? 
8355 2018-07-28 19:47:41 Ok. That did not look easy! I think I’ll just pay the $8.99 and spend more time on pouring the balsamic and oil.
8356 2018-07-28 19:47:33 Theres usually one beside the oil change places.
8357 2018-07-28 19:47:06 Is @nytopinion for real? I was hoping the site was satirical, but they seem like they mean it..(??) Poisoned or not, why can't we provide the entire nation with clean drinking water?! We provide "clean" oil to every city, one would think water would be just as easy, if not easier
8358 2018-07-28 19:46:52 Today has been such a successful day!! My parents saw that my car was literally 1,000 miles PASSED it’s marker for an oil change and that it was covered in filth so they paid for my car wash and my oil change and I didn’t have to lift a finger ugh I love being pathetic
8359 2018-07-28 19:46:49 But she's also forming fr me
8360 2018-07-28 19:46:47 I missed that one, guess I could give it a shot. Even tho I’ve basically given up by now 
My biggest hope was coconut oil, but everything that has coconut in it will literally kill my hair 
Good luck to you! xx
8361 2018-07-28 19:46:41 No boys no.. i willl be first one... : )  .Nuge and McD combo, Drai  is C and to be on second line.
8362 2018-07-28 19:46:39 I'd give absolutely anything to rub oil on your perfect sexy body and fantastic tits and ass.
8363 2018-07-28 19:46:35 Standards?
I remember those.
8364 2018-07-28 19:46:28 hahahaha. Fantastic.

"Baby, you are so wonderful. You're smart, loyal, compassionate and generous. But most of all....Dat Ass.".
8365 2018-07-28 19:46:21 I refuse to recycle or use a metal straw because oil companies exist and that absolves me of any and all personal responsibility
8366 2018-07-28 19:46:05 Odd coincidence: 
In April of 1978, DALLAS debuted, featuring Larry Hagman's manipulative oil baron, J.R. Ewing.

In October of 1978, Jason Robards plays a manipulative land baron (hoping to get into oil) named J.W. Ewing in COMES A HORSEMAN.
8367 2018-07-28 19:46:03 have you had your vitamin d level checked?
Stick with the fish oil--it takes months on it for the benefit to accrue.
8368 2018-07-28 19:45:59 Why buy oil and plastic and contribute to the degradation of our living world when you could uhhhh...buy my nudes¿?
8369 2018-07-28 19:45:57 Opportunity for Our President before Nov Elections to come to Our site of A New Oil Refinery to be Constructed approved this is Trump  MAGA he could put first shovel in the ground Televised telling American People the statistics OF coming Energy Independent ! @JerryFalwellJr

8371 2018-07-28 19:45:30 I hate getting my damn oil changed

8374 2018-07-28 19:45:19 Media hora para cargar gas oil en mi camioneta!!!! Primero que en el pueblucho donde vivo hay una sola @YPFoficial y segundo que los hdrmp pagan el combustible con TARJETA DE CRÉDITO! 
8375 2018-07-28 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8376 2018-07-28 19:45:09 The only benefit of my brother coming back home is.... I can steal his beard oil 
8377 2018-07-28 19:45:08 I love old oil paintings and antiques and lots of things I have a great admiration of the old build.
8378 2018-07-28 19:44:45 I never dated women primarily based on how sexy she was, it was never the definitive issue. Most women are beautiful in some way. 

So,  agreed.
8379 2018-07-28 19:44:45 There are many who still seem  think Lucic will be on the third line. Said last season that wasn't an option in 18-19 to start the year and stand by it.
8380 2018-07-28 19:44:38 Ok In that case u can form 
8381 2018-07-28 19:44:30 "Just 55% of the Americans know that the sun is a star..." 
If there is oil on the sun, 99% would know it and the sun would need democracy.
8382 2018-07-28 19:44:30 The drinks never hit me. Cbd oil does and its strong. I’ve never been able to make it so I can take it and function though. Always makes me want to sleep. Unfortunately I’ve found that prescribed drugs work the best to help rest the brain chemistry that is currently off.
8383 2018-07-28 19:44:14 So @SearsAuto took over 6 hours to get Toni's oil changed and tires rotated with the representative being a total ass to us the whole time. 
8384 2018-07-28 19:44:06 So irritated with myself.  Finally sat down to dye hair and realize after I'm slathered in coconut oil that my bleach powder is at home.  Hotel life is not optimal.

8387 2018-07-28 19:43:59 Look like aphids. Get someone out to spray. In the fall have tree treated with dormant oil spray.
8388 2018-07-28 19:43:55 The first season is about KITT coping with the loss of Michael and missin the glory days of the 80’s and how he is doing ride share because he is saving up for “Transformer” like modifications so he can be more independent and do things for himself like change his own oil.

8391 2018-07-28 19:43:31 @CNN running some nonsense about oil drilling in Alaska. Such nonsense.  Oh gosh!
8392 2018-07-28 19:43:31 Russia has probably planned their attack on the USA years ago, they hv plan A-social media: plan-B- power grid -infrastructure: plan C- submarines sitting on USA shores posing as oil rigs...USA IS already under attack- w/a lame duck sitting as their elected USA president.
8393 2018-07-28 19:43:15 Noodles ,oil
8394 2018-07-28 19:43:10 Lol I already love @brokenwingx_
8395 2018-07-28 19:42:59 It will!! Long as that head slicker than baby oil 
8396 2018-07-28 19:42:54 Michael is bopping in his bed, just had to apply some oil to his feet to chill him out. #DjMichaelBean in the house with shakedown live
8397 2018-07-28 19:42:48 This world may not survive Trump... 

He's now going after 100 million acres of protected land in Alaska to drill for oil. He won't stop until it's all gone... until we're all gone.
8398 2018-07-28 19:42:44 I had to change the channel. I couldn't stomach that the Trump Administration wants to drill for oil in one of the mosted untouched part of the world in Alaska that's filled with the most beautiful wildlife. #Damn #GodGelpUs
8399 2018-07-28 19:42:40 It’d be nice to have someone peel off my face mask and oil my scalp
8400 2018-07-28 19:42:38 I'd be ok w/ that, as that is likely the best lineup to start what is going to be a tough opening few weeks of the season.  That said, far too many will lose their shit if Leon and McDavid are on the same line 
8401 2018-07-28 19:42:31 Or downright dangerous depending on where you travel. Many countries you may not want to have to explain discrepancy.
8402 2018-07-28 19:42:25 Peak Oil for sure. I like thematic game. Mmm, 7th Continent is not si bad; solo possibility
8403 2018-07-28 19:42:22 snake oil, missed connections, or maybe one where the other gives you a fake movie title and you have to tell us what it's about. it could also be played like a roulette game!!!
8404 2018-07-28 19:41:53 White rice
Small oil
8405 2018-07-28 19:41:43 Me watching people dab the oil off their slice of food court pizza:

ALL THE NAPKINS IN THE WORLD CANNOT ABSOLVE YOU BECKY! YOU ARE DIRTY LIKE THE REST OF US!
8406 2018-07-28 19:41:36 Actually, it is. There is oil in the skin. The pot somehow extracts the oil from the chicken and uses it to fry it. I know, because someone came to my house to market the pots. Too expensive for me.
8407 2018-07-28 19:41:29 What if Greco-Roman wrestling with lashings of baby oil isn't theirs?

8411 2018-07-28 19:41:09 They’re literally replacing plastics with paper that takes deforestation to to produce and MORE oil use than plastic RIGHT NOW.
8412 2018-07-28 19:41:04 U just reminded me I need a oil change I’m not looking forward to smh 
8413 2018-07-28 19:41:03 snake oil... More snake oil.. please
8414 2018-07-28 19:41:00 Missing my jacket,

8417 2018-07-28 19:40:37 hot oil massage >>>>>>>>>>
8418 2018-07-28 19:40:34 Yes, it’s on the side! I’ll snap a pic of it. I love it 1. Because Enzo loves it (way more than Cocosoya) 2. It has flax oil which is expensive on its own but super beneficial 3. No inflammatory soy
8419 2018-07-28 19:40:30 Its a discussion paper. A starting point. Its not SNP policy. It outlined where we are now under tory austerity. How we can move forward - even accepts GERS & leaves out oil.  SNP played a blinder. It removed the two sticks you continually try to beat them with.

8421 2018-07-28 19:40:07 Trump asked Saudia Arabia to produce more oil to keep prices of gas down.  They agreed, you need to pay attention
8422 2018-07-28 19:40:05 In saudi it’s easier to find tanning oil than sunblock
8423 2018-07-28 19:39:57 "Look at Venezuela  , Socialist  Democracies  cant work" means lets ignore the successes  of 
Denmark

Finland

Netherlands

Canada

Sweden

Norway

Ireland

New Zealand

Belgium
  
ands lets ignore  the US destabilization of Venezuela  to pressure  them to give us their Oil .
8424 2018-07-28 19:39:50 yeah I'm a conditioner, water, oil type of girl.
8425 2018-07-28 19:39:48 Very possible. Oil prices went up only temporarily. They don’t have anything else despite all the brains and mineral wealth
8426 2018-07-28 19:39:42 Same timeframe like Crude oil for a low ?
8427 2018-07-28 19:39:40 It's been awhile since you did conspiracies/weird things? I know those take alot of work to research tho. Maybe another game (roulette, snake oil, nuclear winter, etc.) love you guys and love the podcast 
8428 2018-07-28 19:39:39 “This town only has fish and oil jobs.”
“That’s gross they both smell bad”
8429 2018-07-28 19:39:33 Lol the 'hella disrespecting' part  Use castor oil.. Pour it in moisturiser/hairfood .. whatever you are using
8430 2018-07-28 19:39:10 True actually! I did used to wonder why it was called “oil” when it is usually solid - you’ve just uncovered the answer!
8431 2018-07-28 19:39:08 “Crooked Hillary” is a sign of second-hand hatred mindlessly mimed from a demagogue. It tells us @MeghanMcCain is shallow as an oil slick, but far less reflective.
8432 2018-07-28 19:38:59 Snake oil
8433 2018-07-28 19:38:40 we can agree 27-97 days are over and he’ll be with Draisaitl, he’s not getting up to 50pts. 45ish is fair. 40 is the bare minimum. 

They might want to start McDavid and Draisaitl L1 out of the gate. And Lucic - Nuge. Make the change after 8-10 games.
8434 2018-07-28 19:38:30 i woke up this morning thinking about tomato oil
thanks cny, you're corrupting me
8435 2018-07-28 19:38:18 I’m pretty sure @nadhimzahawi doesn’t have many ideas! Unless he is getting £30k a month from a gulf state oil company! Completely in it for himself and doesn’t give two hoots about stratford!
8436 2018-07-28 19:38:17 talking slick like it was oil speaking
8437 2018-07-28 19:38:13 See urself. When someone is trying to impress u. Abeg go toast her nd stop forming too
8438 2018-07-28 19:38:08 At the moment it costs more to extract oil in Scotland than it's actually worth to sell...
8439 2018-07-28 19:37:51 I just want a partner that likes to do the stuff I hate. Or at least likes me enough to do them for me. Like take my car one Saturday to get it detailed, oil changed, air in tires etc. I have the money, just not the interest for that stuff.
8440 2018-07-28 19:37:44 Norway’s largest business by far is its oil company, which is two-thirds owned by the government. It’s a democratic socialist country & it’s wealthy.  Its universities are tuition free. Health care is heavily subsidized & essentially free.

Not exactly laissez faire capitalism.
8441 2018-07-28 19:37:41 UH IM BASIC BUT I LOVE SNAKE OIL.
8442 2018-07-28 19:37:41 If you don’t die your hair I recommend washing your hair (roots) with head and shoulders! It strips build up but if you colour your hair...it strips colour so don’t hahahahaha!! The matrix oil is 
8443 2018-07-28 19:37:39 lmaooo i couldnt sleep well cause of sleep paralysis so i went to my parents’ room to sleep but my mom whipped out her essential oils and it smelled so bad... like that oil in particular just smelled so much like rottenf eet or whatever IT JUST SMELLED DISGUSTING OK
8444 2018-07-28 19:37:22 Honours even in head to heads last year, unless you bring in the ICC. When you’ve won the league in double figures & the Champions League, we might start to take notice, until then be content with being an oil fuelled fanboy club selling its tickets on @talkSPORT #MUFC_Family
8445 2018-07-28 19:37:13 Did it suggest an oil change to celebrate?
8446 2018-07-28 19:36:30 more snake oil pls it always makes me wheeze
8447 2018-07-28 19:36:26 Driving your car after a fresh oil change >
8448 2018-07-28 19:36:13 SNAKE OIL AGAIN
8449 2018-07-28 19:36:11 Cheesy fries, super stacked burgers with grease spilling out, pizza with an oil sheen and rubber cheese. This is the kind of food that grosses me out. Why do we have to eat this/why does that have to be available as the cheapest option?
8450 2018-07-28 19:36:08 Having a accurate passport is intolerable? 
I would think travelling with one designating male,  appearing to be female and being denied entry would be intolerable.  
Accuracy doesnt count?
8451 2018-07-28 19:36:07 Yup!  Looks will make you want her in your life.

Warmth will make you want to keep her there!

8455 2018-07-28 19:35:43 Is that oil or acrylics on canvas? In either case, lovely still life 
8456 2018-07-28 19:35:42 Curious...what does Sarah Palin (who can see Russia from her porch) think of T-rump's plans to drill for oil in Alaska's wildlife range??

8459 2018-07-28 19:35:25 I’m waiting on an oil change and a lady has been giving me the stank eye the whole time. She finally comes up and asks me why I’m playing a children’s game (#Pokemon). Before I could even reply she dropped her ice cream cone right on the ground. I just smiled and said “for fun”.
8460 2018-07-28 19:35:23 Quite old Boden yip @SkinnyTan oil (darj).

8463 2018-07-28 19:35:12 or snake oil or conspiracy theories
8464 2018-07-28 19:35:07 I’m not sure why the name is. But I put fish oil on his food and wash him with some medicated shampoo I got from the vet.

8471 2018-07-28 19:34:55 Today's mania has consisted of covering myself in off brand Chinese motor oil and relishing in various harebrained scheme's
8472 2018-07-28 19:34:49 Since when is considering communities and people below the poverty line in Indonesia as stakeholders in addressing the impacts of unsustainable palm oil "condescending and paternalistic?"
(So one ardent troll accuses me!)
8473 2018-07-28 19:34:49 Politico is trying to normalize child rape before it takes down Hollywood and the DNC. Salon and TED Talks are in the attempt as well.

8477 2018-07-28 19:34:38 I’ve taken Ibuprofen , Advil, and peppermint oil today.. still have a migraine. 
8478 2018-07-28 19:34:26 However, if you look at the behaviour of the industry - cost cutting & consolidating, exploring & testing like mad but not finding much - they’re acting as though it’s true despite their denials. It’s why they’re going for more difficult resources. No easy oil left to find.
8479 2018-07-28 19:34:21 I don't see a great sunset, I see 17 oil tankers!

8482 2018-07-28 19:34:15 Miller flour/salt and pepper/light paprika in bowl, egg wash, dip and bread, pan fry lightly in walnut oil, not a flash fry, ruins the walnut oil. Lay on paper towel to drain, add a chilled semi-dry Tuscan white wine to mouth. Great with baked spaghetti squash.
8483 2018-07-28 19:34:13 It's dead obvious at this point that Oil, given how easy it is to import personnel and equipment, and how few people who are needed to run the project is a corruption enhancer.  I'd bet major reason Norway benefited is due to extra requirements of sea oil.
8484 2018-07-28 19:34:12 dumb argument. the economy was based almost entirely on oil and the previous president spent $ as if the price of oil would never go down. He died, the price of oil tanked, and the new president has run the country into the ground. the fact it was socialist has little to do

8488 2018-07-28 19:33:24 the problem is that you sound like youre attempting to sell people a "Brand Name" 4 all the weird weather & you aren't offering any solutions. Are you here to bring about change and save lives? Neither political party has showed much resolve against Oil other than JFK. & he dead.

8491 2018-07-28 19:32:55 I use vinegar. I turn up the heat until it evaporates then I use a little oil. Works like a charm.
8492 2018-07-28 19:32:47 Just facts and figures for those that are interested. Oil temperature is really useful if you're intent on using it on track – it's surprising how many performance-focused cars lack things like that, so good to see Suzuki fitting it regardless.

Not talking about just the avi's

Values, sense of self, common sense, friendliness, demeanor.

God! How that all matters!  For a guy, you want to come home to that!
8505 2018-07-28 19:30:49 I’ve been looking at apartments ever since I left from getting my oil changed. These margaritas are very much so welcomed at this time!
8506 2018-07-28 19:30:23 So, you tax carbons, transition to green energy and how many oil workers and logistics support workers lose their jobs and are now living off the government?  Socialism does not work.
8507 2018-07-28 19:30:15 Literally been in the car on the go since 10 am  oil change took forever  n it’s hot af outside

Once oil companies add #Hydrogen pumps to their stations globally, Battery #EV's will return to the niche market they have occupied since the early 1900's.
8509 2018-07-28 19:30:07 Over the years I’ve seen all the claims of “debunking” Peak Oil including claims of “Abiotic” oil that has no supporting evidence. Curiously, those claiming Peak Oil is a myth are from the industry & the financial world. Peak oil researchers tend to be whistleblowers & retirees.

8514 2018-07-28 19:29:10 I roasted whatever are available together. Beetroot parsnips onions pumpkin. Bit early for the other stuff. Cut up like that about 20 to 25 minutes. Bit of olive oil and some rosemary. Test with a sharp knife after 15 minutes or so.
8515 2018-07-28 19:29:03 Uh. No. The world economy is based on the dollar - not be V bolivar. 

Also, V imploded because it was entirely dependent upon oil sales and didn’t plan or save in case the value of oil decreased. 

Printing money wasn’t the singular problem. It was a reaction.
8516 2018-07-28 19:29:02 Unemployment has 'always' been higher when Labour's left office than when they were voted in. Corbyn hailed Venezuelan economics - 82% of households now live in poverty despite huge oil reserves. Look and learn - check it out.

8518 2018-07-28 19:28:55 Who do you suggest we vote for? Because @GovernorTomWolf accepted $98,000 from oil and gas. Both @realScottWagner and @WolfForPA are in bed with fossil fuels! We deserve better and we demand better!

8526 2018-07-28 19:27:32 Was it a book about oil?
8527 2018-07-28 19:27:02 Can't do without oil..

8530 2018-07-28 19:26:31 Very good analysis. I would also add the reason plastic is so cheap is because its a byproduct of processing crude oil (polymers). And as long as we use gasoline there's going to be polymers.
8531 2018-07-28 19:26:19 Add oil before using?  Also, Honda really is worth the extra $100 imo.

8534 2018-07-28 19:25:56 Oil lobby was a major influence.
8535 2018-07-28 19:25:46 People read quotes of a Trillion Barrels of Shale oil in some economic article without realising that when the geological surveys are done it will be downgraded massively, then on top of that will take almost as much energy to extract & refine as you get burning the end product.
8536 2018-07-28 19:25:37 if any animal is accidentally stuck to a glue trap, pour kitchen cooking oil over them to quickly and safely release.
8537 2018-07-28 19:25:19 Cowering to Putin, because of 1 sentence? How about days prior to the meeting him bashing Germany for their oil deal with Russia, how about we have Russians in Syria, how about making America self sufficient in power, all of this HURTS Russia. Way stronger on Russia than Obama.

8544 2018-07-28 19:23:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.

8547 2018-07-28 19:23:44 How is asking a question about the guy who works for his company, who also works with Edelman, about PEDs bad journalism? So because you blindly praise Brady working with a snake oil salesmen, that somehow makes it unacceptable to ask him about that?

8567 2018-07-28 19:20:15 What economists? I know many. Now if you are listening to the Krugman camp they seek Keynesian spending and are not concerned with global commodities they deem to be obsolete. But yes gas prices tick up every summer 15%. This isn’t oil related. It’s the refining process.
8568 2018-07-28 19:20:05 CBD hemp oil helps neuro inflammation.  Prostate cancer too.  Don’t wait to convince bureaucrats !  Too much like herding cats !
8569 2018-07-28 19:19:52 @423gray @amafera @katmac801 what I think happened was, mineral oil container broke, we moved freezers. Door got left open and thawed. We moved back not knowing and it blocked return air.
8570 2018-07-28 19:19:47 2/ global oil production still comes from super giant fields that were mostly discovered between the 30’s & the 60’s. They’re depleting & not being replaced. Dirty resources like tar sands have a poor return of about 4.5 to 1. No one can make Shale profitable
8571 2018-07-28 19:19:44 Yeah. Crummy thing is that it starts consistently and runs decent not tnisblosing oil and coolant. It’s just not worth anything. I bought it to drive to kalispell (5 hours away). I don’t want to trust it that far. Would be great for local driving.
8572 2018-07-28 19:19:44 It got oily way too fast —even indoors in the AC and I mean I liked that it was natural looking I just couldn’t with the oil build up — fenty never did me dirty like that — I even tried all the “mattifying” methods Jackie Aina tried — with the Laura mercier b4hand -didn’t work
8573 2018-07-28 19:19:38 Hmmm this hemp oil is something else. I'm more calm and I feel like going to sleep
8574 2018-07-28 19:19:36 I could believe Norway because of how much is dominated by oil, but Finland? I'm certain Sweden, but I thought Finland also privatized a lot and moved away from socialism over the past decades.

8598 2018-07-28 19:15:34 What’s often called oil isn’t really oil at all, certainly not the liquid at room temperature type. Most of US shale deposits have been hugely downgraded eg the Monterey Shale which I believe is down to less than the equivalent of a couple of days US consumption. Most of 1/

8621 2018-07-28 19:12:53 Today I’m thankful for ex boyfriends who come over to change your car oil and wash it for you.
8622 2018-07-28 19:12:45 Why do 46% of Republicans support oil drilling off the coast? They can’t all own oil companies!
8623 2018-07-28 19:12:29 When Trump Policies interfere with National Food Security, it is a big deal. Tariffs threaten to push more land out of Food Production. Between Oil extractive practices that ruin water & Econ War Acts that make Farmers exit the business Food Security damaged.
8624 2018-07-28 19:12:14 Death & Destruction? Unemployment dropped from 11% to under 5%, stock market at all time high, home prices soared, poverty down, 15 million+ insured, health premiums increased at half the rate they did under GWB, violent crime down significantly, US oil production doubled....
8625 2018-07-28 19:12:10 You're dead wrong here. The majority of the Norwegian economy is state owned. Norway has nationalized the largest oil company, largest airline, largest energy company. Among many others.
8626 2018-07-28 19:12:08 For me I notice that it shows up when I eat too much flour/gluten. Try cutting those out and see if it reduces. Also, these face masks really help- turmeric+lime juice, molasses+cinnamon, tea tree oil as spot treatment
8627 2018-07-28 19:12:01 Just seen 2 cows and an oil tanker fly past the window...but the neighbours are still having a BBQ

#northernheatwave2018
8628 2018-07-28 19:12:00 There is. The initial cost, the investment is real And then once it’s there -there is less cost than oil. But you knew that.
8629 2018-07-28 19:11:52 And many of the major companies include the oil & gas companies, who make MASSIVE profits on the high price of gas, so of course they are not looking to lower it any time soon. Then you have cable and sports franchises that charge high fees on top of collecting from advertisers.
8630 2018-07-28 19:11:46 @iAmNiyola does your slap smell like hot oil
8631 2018-07-28 19:11:41 They really gon hate when they can't destroy you, then expect the royal treatment, talkin slick like it's oil speakin.
8632 2018-07-28 19:11:34 To allow safe clean up of the oil. You’ll see the size of the spill when you get to the scene
8633 2018-07-28 19:11:29 Those courses were designed to be for electricians who had training in another sector like oil rigs and the like but who wanted to move over to domestic and Part P.

Instead they are being sold as the gateway in
8634 2018-07-28 19:11:16 Most of the time statistical data is presented to advance a narrative, as it is here. A conclusion is presented, then data is selectively analysed to support it.
Here, conclusion is an obvious truth, but obscures more nuanced contrary facts to narrative.

8639 2018-07-28 19:10:23 dang it...i forgot to take my car to the dealer to get the oil changed today :(  Now I have to do it on Monday.  Looks like Jacob will be watching kids for me for a little while Monday morning

8641 2018-07-28 19:10:18 Yeah, didn’t sleep for 6 days then binned them.. I find CBD oil best tbh
8642 2018-07-28 19:10:08 For all cryptoeconomic construction, staker liquidity is nothing but deterrence for suiside attack. If oil tycoons are only able to plan it, frequency of crisis is enough mitigated and quality of ressurection can be lower priority.
8643 2018-07-28 19:10:05 Whilst traffic was slow it was safe to have one lane open, however the oil went on both lanes so the traffic was temp stopped to allow for safe clean up. It’s open now.
8644 2018-07-28 19:10:05 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
8645 2018-07-28 19:10:01 Ahhh geeze. Just use a lemon and kosher salt, rub it in, rinse and use a paper towel with oil to coat it. Done.

8647 2018-07-28 19:09:55 Aww boo, try applying raw egg. subsequently use olive oil to avoid scarring. This sugar daddy has to come through to stop this bike nonsense!
8648 2018-07-28 19:09:49 what can we do :) ? there are plans to apply taxes this year & oil prices are increasing monthly also there are no enough jobs for people & the unemployment ratio is increasing every year
8649 2018-07-28 19:09:47 Golan Heights important for Israel as much as it is for Dick Cheney, Lord Rothschild. Lots of money to made from oil for all getting a piece of the action geopolitically or for natural resources.
8650 2018-07-28 19:09:42 Keep your lips moisturized at all times and avoid licking lips. Exfoliate lips gently with a little almond oil and a soft toothbrush.
8651 2018-07-28 19:09:41 Nah man. Beard tips are like asking how you got your eyeliner wings so on point.

"Is there an oil you use? How do you kill beard dandruff?"
8652 2018-07-28 19:09:40 Alex Guerrero is a snake oil salesman, and Bill Belichick was right to get rid of him. I read that guy was touting some mess that could cure cancer. Players were ignoring the advice of the trainers in favor of him.
8653 2018-07-28 19:09:37 I read this after washing my hair.......in argan oil shampoo. Ima go wash it again now xx

8662 2018-07-28 19:08:14 You are leaving out the plummet in oil prices, the fixed exchange rate, the lack of productive capacity, the currency black market, the corruption and political games designed to hurt the population, etc.
8663 2018-07-28 19:08:14 And yet we happily consume carbonated beverages that come in half-liter, one-liter, and two-liter bottles. Olive oil, too. (Although perhaps not quite as rapidly, which could explain why I've only seen the 2-liter at Costco.)
8664 2018-07-28 19:08:06 Went to the 5min oil change for a first and those gentlemen were very pleasant and the service is better than Nissan. They walked me through everything they were doing even showed the new oil level – bij Take 5 Oil Change

8667 2018-07-28 19:07:45 The article you quote from Zero Hedge shows 4.5 billion barrels. Let’s say they double that before year end. It’s still less than a third of annual consumption. Also, the Net Energy of these newer resources is far lower than conventional oil meaning less available for the economy
8668 2018-07-28 19:07:24 So, they have started to sell more oil, while Iran has been getting sanctioned? It is not like either of these three country produce anything, they only sell fossil fuels, and that's what their economy be, when they have no more fossile fuel to sell, a fossil.
8669 2018-07-28 19:07:11 Bitcoin hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is the rise of many greedy snake oil sales man  shitcoiners, pretending to be libertarian, piggy back riding btc. Be careful cause your ego and greed can be your own worst enemy.

Thanks
8672 2018-07-28 19:06:57 They can't separate a career public servant (Hillary) from a treasonous, self aggrandizing, racist & sexist snake oil salesman (#ComradeDon)
8673 2018-07-28 19:06:43 I never said they were a waste of money. Countries that rid their dependence of oil will no longer be under the yoke of the dollar.  Any step in that direction is good for them and their country. Not so much for the US.
8674 2018-07-28 19:06:42 @DrGundry an approved oil is red palm oil - how about “palm oil” unspecified? Trying to determine if some plantain chips are ok. Thanks

8678 2018-07-28 19:06:24 The Gov stats (2016) claim that 30% of our food is from Europe. I can live without baked beans & similar tinned/processed foods but if there’s a cheese, wine, sun-dried tomato, olive oil or coffee shortage I’ll be migrating...if anywhere will accept me post-#Brexitchaos

8691 2018-07-28 19:05:04 Get me a free oil change 
8692 2018-07-28 19:05:01 Hi, thanks for reaching out as we take customer feedback seriously. Could you please DM us with details on his oil change?

8694 2018-07-28 19:04:44 The socialist country's like Norway that every socialist talks about has the strictest immigration laws, has a population of 5million+, only partial socialist, wealth in public came from oil, and a way smaller gdp. We also have about 12.5 undocumented citizens.
8695 2018-07-28 19:04:38 Fuck it after I eat and get my nails done and go shopping and pay my car insurance and get my oil changed I’m going to work again. The money more consistent than a nigga love
8696 2018-07-28 19:04:05 Used to be my local mate! Loved that place. Many a Sunday night in there contemplating a week’s work, a Wednesday for CL footie and quiz, a Friday and Saturday just because and a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday as I normally ran out of heating oil and they had the open fire
8697 2018-07-28 19:03:57 I wonder if my car feels better today after it got an oil change?  I wonder how if would feel if people could get an oil change every so often?
8698 2018-07-28 19:03:32 And S is branded XL, M will be XXL etc... and every 20th on every lot is coated with jalapeno oil... for extra excitement 
8699 2018-07-28 19:03:13 I’ve been studying Peak Oil for 20 years Ian. It’s not a myth. The oil industry would like us to think otherwise. Deep sea still has very high production costs & is very problematic. We saw how that turned out a few years back in the Mex Gulf. Discovery is well below consumption.

8706 2018-07-28 19:01:08 Basically a whole foods, plant based diet. dark leafy greens, healthy fats, grains like quinoa, minimal overly processed foods/gluten. I use the peppermint or the tea tree oil :)
8707 2018-07-28 19:01:02 WOW THATS SO MESSED UP!! Makes me wonder what happens when I drop my car off at popboys. Free oil change for life!

8711 2018-07-28 19:00:31 What i did on pixatool for this cases is add some "oil painting" and "erode/dilate" shaders with amount values to config, that works as jpeg artifact removal, sure there can be better ways but this ones also worked as cool FX, maybe that can helps you or give some ideas ;)

8725 2018-07-28 18:58:30 After an emergency gall bladder removal I chose to not take the prescription opiates and rather used Full Extract Cannabis Oil (FECO). Never took an opiate post discharge/release. Alternatives to opiates exist but are targets for prohibition from those that oppose opiates. Odd.
8726 2018-07-28 18:58:27 Bold = Expensive.  The oil and gas industry provides over 40,000 jobs and a total economic impact of tens of billions of dollars yearly ($31.7 billion in 2014.) Pollution is at an all time low, and #PolisWrongForCO wants to shut it down.  He's too extreme for Colorado.

8734 2018-07-28 18:57:07 Increase your fat. Use olive oil, full fat butter. Eat cheese. Make sure your logging things like oil and butter than your using too. Avocado is good to add as a side to meals or snacks and it’s high fat.  I like Cronometer better than MFP.
8735 2018-07-28 18:57:04 There was overwhelming consensus on oil running out, too. And Y2K. Scientific agreement is a myth. Do open minded research. I don’t believe humans can change climate any more than we can change weather but we do need to look at strategies for living in changing world.

8751 2018-07-28 18:55:37 As the energy renaissance has continued to raise U.S. natural gas and oil production and exports to record levels, these fuels and feedstocks contribute to the economy and — by themselves — generated nearly half of the growth in U.S. real exports in Q2. #energy #export
8752 2018-07-28 18:55:25 I only walked into Whole Foods for almond oil and rosé.

8753 2018-07-28 18:55:25 Just for transparency - Im in the full suite of risk off trades - long dollars, short oil, short equities, long bonds, long eurodollar futures, etc. Took profits my India bets and other EM (mixed bag - big win in Iran vs Turkey and losses in Nigeria and Ghana). 1/
8754 2018-07-28 18:54:58 I just use cuticle oil on my cuticles and around the acrylic when they looking dry. Mine last a good 6 weeks.
8755 2018-07-28 18:54:51 It's really amazing to me how Black men know NOTHING about their hair beyond waves. I watched a nigga put oil in his hair and put like nothing in his hand talking about "I still don't understand why my scalp is dry"
8756 2018-07-28 18:54:35 Fog lifted in Camden. 6x8 oil on board.

8762 2018-07-28 18:53:11 Interesting fact: 15 of 19 9/11 terrorists were Saudis. Did you ban them? No. Why? Oil & money. You relished, at the time, that Trump Tower was now the tallest building in NYC. You should #ResignNow #TangerineTraitor
8763 2018-07-28 18:53:11 PDP failure to invest or even maintain our infrastructure namely railways, roads, electricity, in spite of having earned over $500 billion from oil & gas alone, during the 16 years of PDP rule. PDP looters want to desperately  come to power? @renoomokri you are a sick. #Looters
8764 2018-07-28 18:53:06 I hope when they build the refinery the oil which is to be refined will be gotten from katsina, otherwise they should forget it. Using federal power to cheap/oppress certain region ain't gonna work this time around.
8765 2018-07-28 18:53:00 That's the MO of your puppet Justin and his friends. Build up a fortune selling people oil and gas, and now the time has come to pay for the damage they tax the next generation to death to clean up the mess made by the rich. Resign, all of you, politics has failed the many.
8766 2018-07-28 18:52:58 Pretty sure there would be enough salt and oil already in the can to stop an elephants heart... no need for more ! Lol
8767 2018-07-28 18:52:53 Rex Tillerson who was the secretary of state was also an Exxon executive. Rex was a major player in giving Russia the  technology to drill for oil in Siberia .

8774 2018-07-28 18:51:43 Iran oil.... Turkey, which is also in the final stages of an arms deal with Russia that could trigger American sanctions. Turkish officials, in both cases, have dismissed the U.S.' threat of sanctions to constrain the choices of other countries. @dcexaminer

My people were forced from the St. Albert area for farms & oil 100 yrs ago & left to starve & now they're signing up for this garbage that should have been offered then. Too little, too late. Dying industry.

8783 2018-07-28 18:49:45 this would be true, but i think the assumption is an EV would *substitute* for one of those cars, rather than add to them. in any case, changing the fleet wholesale from gas to electric would reduce pollution (assuming the electric source is cleaner than oil)

8799 2018-07-28 18:47:43 Max Siollun's Oil, Politics and Violence is one book that rewards my reading effort with a chilliness whenever I go back to extract a piece of information. Every page is soaked with blood.
8800 2018-07-28 18:47:41 This is sickening. For anyone, right, left, center so on and so on, to think that child marriage is ok, then, as a society we’ve failed.

8807 2018-07-28 18:46:50 Why are we ferrying oil anyway? Can we have it refined in the Northern part of Kenya? Is it expensive to transport than process at the source? Transport was a bad idea for Kenyans and locals.

8809 2018-07-28 18:46:36 Buying a truck was one of my better life decisions. When I took my old car to get the oil changed, nobody ever said “hey buddy, nice truck man.”

Because it wasn’t a truck.

Or nice.

8814 2018-07-28 18:46:16 15 of the 19 attackers of 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia, yet you did not include S. Arabia in your immigration ban.  Why?  Oh, that's right because of arms and oil deals.  Stop fear-mongering when it is convenient to do so.

8817 2018-07-28 18:46:05 Cuba has a lower child mortatliy rate than the United States according to UNICEF. It is the last country an apologist for capitalism should bring up. Venezuela had a 50% poverty rate in 1999 after decades of being a major oil exporter. Failure of capitalism?

8832 2018-07-28 18:44:03 Answer 1. Nigeria can sell Agricultural produce to the world. Before oil was discovered in 1950. Nig exported groundnut, cocoa, hides/skin etc. Let the FG increase yearly budgetary allocation for agriculture and let each state produce in large quantities what they are best at.
8833 2018-07-28 18:43:39 Yessss !!!! Lol but something with the oil sense needs fixing

Based on the replies to my comments, most people don't have any clues as to how time frames work. This deficiency could cause money losses. The relativity is how they intertwine with each other, i.e. while H4 is bearish, H1 could be bullish sometimes.
8835 2018-07-28 18:43:32 That’s a Must Miss for me. Your GOP sycophancy and Snake Oil push for a candidate no one in the know wants is one of your lowest points in the Senate. One of many. #NoKavanaugh

8869 2018-07-28 18:39:04 Most salad dressings were $3ish. I was drawn to a more natural one, new flavour to me, orange balsamic, avocado oil base for $8ish (on sale from $9).

8883 2018-07-28 18:37:20 And no cheating. Like, if you’re going to make rules about SNAP you don’t get to use the truffle oil and spices and junk you already have in your pantry.

8885 2018-07-28 18:37:01 Sometimes, but something is wrong with my oil
8886 2018-07-28 18:36:27 Within Calgary's oil biz, employees are terrified of anti-oil messages, of being associated with it. Reputation is a HUGE factor in oil careers. Then they demand compliance by family, friends, media, etc. Oil co's bribe/control media. An unhealthy network of ego, fear, futility.

8889 2018-07-28 18:35:33 ...or Baby oil.
8890 2018-07-28 18:35:27 IM FINALLY GETTING MY OIL CHANGED TODAY YALL
8891 2018-07-28 18:35:27 BS, the money was in accounts fed with proceeds of Iran oil exports. No taxpeyer´s money was involved. The wall would be paid by my taxes.

8893 2018-07-28 18:35:04 "It's a deconstructed chicken sandwich with croutons for the bread, served with potato slices browned in oil and a tomato reduction."
8894 2018-07-28 18:35:04 I'm going to say you think it's fair because you think AG is a snake oil salesman. Got it. 
Might want to start asking all of the players that train at Bridge Performance in the off-season if it's fair to connect those trainers to the PED poppers, just to be fair of course.
8895 2018-07-28 18:34:59 LOL we dont even have oil money 
8896 2018-07-28 18:34:58 I understand, yet I don't share this view. I see code, just like any other piece of art, like an oil painting, never finished, yet, imho, done doesn't mean finished.
8897 2018-07-28 18:34:38 nigga a BUGATTI oil change is 21k lmaoo.. i'm good
8898 2018-07-28 18:34:31 have just discovered the concept of drive through oil changes 
8899 2018-07-28 18:34:27 Thanks to oil, and you can bet that most of the oil revenue goes to the Saudi mArabian "royal"s instead of the ordinary public.

8901 2018-07-28 18:34:16 I changed my own oil and only had to call my dad twice so who’s the adult now?
8902 2018-07-28 18:34:14 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.
8903 2018-07-28 18:34:00 334
8904 2018-07-28 18:33:59 "Everything good is capitalism everything bad is socialism" isn't a consistent or reasonable position.

What else would you call nationalized oil in Norway?
8905 2018-07-28 18:33:58 What does Oman have to offer to the rest of the world once the oil money is gone?
8906 2018-07-28 18:33:37 Pretty much. The question is how much are the people willing to give in taxes & what services come of that.

Plus the state owned all oil which is a double edged sword (PEMEX in MEX; failure). On the other hand you can have Nigeria (no regulation, mad corruption bc of SHELL)
8907 2018-07-28 18:33:33 Maybe because:

*We had no  for him to do it b4 now.

*Niger Delta Militants blew up pipelines in his 1st few months in office which reduced our crude oil export &  revenue generated b4 now.

*we need increase in electricity generation & this 1 was abandoned for years b4 now.

8911 2018-07-28 18:32:42 Say what you will about Trump but at least he's creating jobs. Baby jail guards, sexual assault counselors for children, wall builders, Muslim deporters, propaganda specialists, yacht guards, drone operators, oil pipeline architects...

8914 2018-07-28 18:31:50 This starter pack is missing succulents, canvas aprons and beard oil. Other than that...pretty spot on.
8915 2018-07-28 18:31:42 Pretty much the Venezuelan model.  With less oil.

8923 2018-07-28 18:30:47 So I have to season my ceramic and my cast iron frying pans fairly often. The quick way turns out to use Olive Oil Pam spray and a high flame on the stove until the oil smokes. Then wipe it with paper towels. Can cook on it soon after.

8933 2018-07-28 18:29:40 Don’t put coconut oil on your face, it will clog your pores. It’s perfect for letting eyebrow and eyelashes get thicker but it’s bad for you skin

8940 2018-07-28 18:29:03 A “fraud” is someone who lies to people, takes their money aka Trump U. Did Jake do that? I am not who I was ten years ago. Adults grow, change. Trump is still the same snake oil salesman he always was.
8941 2018-07-28 18:28:59 What amazes me the most is all the symbolic radicalism involved in climate activism. Yes we can make more efficient cars and people who care buy them. But how do you heat New York, Chicago, London or Berlin during freezing winter's without trillions of m3 of natural gas and oil?

Since u sell snake oil I take it citing sources and verifiable sources outside Faux news & infowars is hard for u
8948 2018-07-28 18:28:28 Good gawd  I’m getting MASSIVE notifications from this thread which looks like an invitation to an oil wresting match. Not interested in watching 2 supposed bikini models battle it out. Peace out y’all . This isn’t my thing.
8949 2018-07-28 18:27:59 I agree the oil prices killed their economy but socialism is too partly because funding all those social programs is unsustainable. They killed their private sector and free makets because of it. 
You definitely need some socialism but only what's actually needed.

8969 2018-07-28 18:25:29 The largest oil refinery in Texas is owned by Saudis and that's why they're not on the muslim ban list.

8983 2018-07-28 18:23:26 LNG - cleaner, more stably priced fuel than oil, plus projected to remain cheaper. A 2MW Solar Farm is also to be built there to supplement load. However, using intermittent renewable energy for baseload generation is not yet a fully viable solution in Ja. We will get there.

8995 2018-07-28 18:22:08 Very true, Martin. Plenty of oil in the ground but production costs very high and oil price is much lower than pre-crash.  The 'low hanging fruit' has now mostly been taken.  Virgin basins such as Greenland are just too expensive and therefore not commercial.

9005 2018-07-28 18:20:31 You guys love to ignore external factors that contributed to Venezuela’s crash because it shatters your whole “socialism is bad” narrative. Sensible lefties realize that there’s nothing “egalitarian” or “democratic” about poor economic choices like over-dependence on oil revenue.

9027 2018-07-28 18:16:51 So my followers if you suffer from celiac disease, ibs, depression, anxiety please look into cbd oil, I started taking it last Sunday and I can honestly say I feel 1000% better . I’m still trying to work out my dose but if I have a very bad day I have only gone up to 8 drops xxx

9029 2018-07-28 18:16:24 Lmao not really fucked just need to top off oil and wash it
9030 2018-07-28 18:16:13 A large Calgary based oil and gas company has sold (dumped) almost 2000 gas wells in the Lancer,Abbey, Eston and I think Kyle areas to a small company for $10 bucks likely to offload clean up costs. I think we need a review of the rules for this @farmermegzz @KellyCryderman
9031 2018-07-28 18:16:11 The discovery and production of several hundred millions of barrels equivalent of oil and natural gas in Australia, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Denmark, and Romania.
9032 2018-07-28 18:16:04 Well that’s just cheap politicking. Yuck.
9033 2018-07-28 18:15:18 cbd oil has helped a LOT with my anxiety which is insane because i never thought anything could other than me just trying to train myself not to succumb to unnecessary worrying

9036 2018-07-28 18:14:57 Headed to Lokey Nissan to get Vader’s oil changed... free oil changes for life are fantastic 
9037 2018-07-28 18:14:52 Drank a smoothie, did yoga, and I have freshly shaved legs lathered in coconut oil! Yaaaas.
9038 2018-07-28 18:14:44 Been to Lidl for my Super Weekend stock-up! Half price honey, bockwurst and rapeseed oil. :3
9039 2018-07-28 18:14:38 The rubbery pork thing! With the olive oil and Idk what else 
9040 2018-07-28 18:14:32 Its usually for the venting/release of the shaft/turbine blade cooling air. I can see that any oil leaking from the thrust bearings would exit that way too, but ive only ever worked on rolls trent cores
9041 2018-07-28 18:14:19 Bulgarian tomatoes, feta cheese, a bit of olive oil and some bread is the only dinner I need 
9042 2018-07-28 18:14:15 Valid question: No. There's more or less consensus that it should be banned. The righters wanted their proposed legislation to be accepted but the government voted against it on the basis that they had already started with an inquiry and wanted to wait for the results. >
9043 2018-07-28 18:14:00 In the parable of the 10 virgins in Matt 25: 1-13, all had the means to buy oil. Oil was expensive and took work to extract it. It's ok to preach prosperity as long as we preach wisdom or prudence with it! Many with money will not be looking for the Bridegroom!
9044 2018-07-28 18:13:56 Genuinely baffled at the claim that he is delivering. The Wall? No. Infrastructure bill?No. Better healthcare plan than ACA?No. Promise not to touch Medicare?No. Drain the swamp?No. Tax cuts for all? No. Wages up?No.
Deregulation? Yesbig oil/coal benefit from putting us at risk.
9045 2018-07-28 18:13:43 I’ve been wondering why the surfing for @vanssurf US Open in HB is on the south side, when the larger swells are on the north side of the pier.  Then I realized...they don’t want pics which include the oil rigs.
9046 2018-07-28 18:13:34 Costumer: serves please                             Me: service closed at 1:00                         Costumer: so the not doing anymore oil changes today? .....Didn’t I just tell you stupid non listening ass they closed at 1:00

9052 2018-07-28 18:12:49 You are letting Big Oil off too easy.
9053 2018-07-28 18:12:44 I bought CBD oil to help with my nervousness and anxiety, it honestly has worked! I had a big interview and  I was extremely nervous the days leading up to it. I was so confident at the interview when I probably would’ve been a shaking mess without it! I recommend 
9054 2018-07-28 18:12:40 They're wrong... this was more of a POUNCE!
9055 2018-07-28 18:12:24 use lotsssssss of oil
9056 2018-07-28 18:12:22 My love came up to me and hands me some Japanese cherry blossom oil 
9057 2018-07-28 18:12:21 If any one of you would apply as much direct scrutiny to Rees Mogg, Fox, Davis, Johnson et al, I wouldn’t feel so utterly let down. The get a feee pass to peddle their snake oil. It could cost us everything
9058 2018-07-28 18:12:12 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
9059 2018-07-28 18:11:53 I feel like such a responsible adult...I took my shopping money & went & got things my car NEEDED (oil change, new tires, etc) 
9060 2018-07-28 18:11:52 If it's not Burnt oil it's Manuka Honey these seem to be the go to cures for everything

9062 2018-07-28 18:11:29 This shouldn't ever happen.  Russia needs to remain on sanctions for their horrific attacks on Crimea and our country...and...guess what...once that happens GOP will hugely profit from Russian oil production investments...
9063 2018-07-28 18:11:28 And I don't like children in cages either
9064 2018-07-28 18:11:26 Where did you get your facts, i am willing to bet it was American you literally killed millions of people around the world for oil and you accused the people you starved or bomb because they where socialist, educated yourself before talking
9065 2018-07-28 18:11:11 Can you get those little pots of quinoa or rice? Ignore microwave instructions, just tip in a frying pan for a few mins with tamari, sesame oil, five spice, veg, ready-cooked chicken, whatever you fancy 
9066 2018-07-28 18:10:59 “Alright, then we go to the damn beach. Better bring yo’ baby oil.” He chuckled. “Oh wait, you ain’t Rocky boy.” He laughed.
9067 2018-07-28 18:10:58 They sell CBD oil in the mall that I work in 
9068 2018-07-28 18:10:54 What the fuck has Stacey Got on her legs? Cooking oil? Is that a new thing lady's? Shininy legs ?
9069 2018-07-28 18:10:49 Fuckbois don't know what sleeves are and smell like ranch doritos and oil.

Players are confident, self-aware man sluts.
9070 2018-07-28 18:10:46 F@#k MAGAt’s and their blindness when it comes to this snake oil salesman. I really just don’t get it!  It’s infuriating 
9071 2018-07-28 18:10:28 Sold all gold reserves, gave away billions to foreigners, discouraged investments, destroyed oil & gas sector, invited world’s welfare roaches to come here, ruined relations with USA, welcomed ISIS, etc.

Country on fast track to destruction.

His work is done. 

No need to work.
9072 2018-07-28 18:10:27 Had to wake up early for an oil change..can’t wait to get back home and sleep some more 
9073 2018-07-28 18:10:23 How so?  What are they spreading that is false or misleading? (Serious Q)

9077 2018-07-28 18:10:03 @dodo I know you guys aren’t political, but you should let ALL your viewers know what is going on in Congress with GOP & trump administration trying to roll back laws protecting endangered species to make it easier for mining and oil companies to profit. #SaveEndangeredSpecies
9078 2018-07-28 18:09:58 It's marketing. @canbikecanada instructor sez we can "end the war between cyclists & motorists with education" b/c she makes money from teaching defensive cycling. Many charities promote similar Share The Road messages because they make money from auto, oil & insurance companies.
9079 2018-07-28 18:09:58 Fair enough. Agreed. 
Now introduce (nearly negligible) driver, and, (highly amplifying) feedback, and now we have a problem. 
Who should we target first? The modest driver or the exponential amplifier?
THIS is the conversation.  Not shaming CC “deniers” & oil companies.

9083 2018-07-28 18:09:18 Proven idea for salmon: Use a hot pan slightly covered by olive oil, fire on low, use fresh herbs and only fry it once you have fried the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry salmon on both sides. It won´t stick if you follow these instructions. And its taste is special.
9084 2018-07-28 18:09:14 すずろさんのもさくべーさんのも塗りたかったんだけどね…ほんとふぁぼだけしてね…塗りたいので一年くらい休暇がほしい(
9085 2018-07-28 18:09:01 I mean my da does drink gin and used to fly to the oil rig so you're most likely correct.
9086 2018-07-28 18:08:46 To put it into perspective, according to the article there have been discoveries of 4.5 billion BOE (Barrels of Oil Equivalent) so far in 2018. However, global consumption is about 31 Billion barrels a year. The US alone uses about 20 million barrels a day. The globe about 90 mn
9087 2018-07-28 18:08:45 Interesting points. Supply destruction is inflationary though. The CRB basket is quite broad; from oil to livestock. Talking about the entire commodity complex.
9088 2018-07-28 18:08:39 Thank you cbd oil for all the energy I had today..even coffee free. Home smells wonderful ty peaceful porch
9089 2018-07-28 18:08:24 Luckily, with the help of you guys, I've found a nontoxic way to use oil and I'm so excited to dive right into the medium!
9090 2018-07-28 18:08:18 Trynna be gone off that oil

9097 2018-07-28 18:06:58 I used to use acrylics several years ago, but ever since watercolor came into my life I've disliked acrylic. I've tried acrylic many times since, even after introducing myself to oil, and I just can't get into it. The texture is all wrong for me.
9098 2018-07-28 18:06:51 They never stop justifying outright contempt.

9106 2018-07-28 18:06:16 Zaatar, bread and olive oil is the yummiest 
9107 2018-07-28 18:06:16 And where will Big Oil get the money? From their customers, direct and indirect. We’re all at least indirect customers. So we pay more and Big Oil is essentially unaffected.

Brilliant way for you to get money from everyone else.
9108 2018-07-28 18:06:15 Kinda seems like Politico is in favor of Child Marriages?

9115 2018-07-28 18:05:30 I’m sick of skincare companies making products for oily skin super drying, it’s been proven oily skin needs moisture because when it’s dry it overproduces oil and causes breakouts so what the fuck!!!
9116 2018-07-28 18:05:28 these bitches told me lavender oil cures anxiety. well I drank the entire bottle and I’m still a nervous wreck!

9120 2018-07-28 18:04:57 Just spoken to the area, they have one lane closed south bound due to oil on it which is awaiting to be cleared by Highways.
9121 2018-07-28 18:04:45 Let’s put him in a pan with some oil and shake it until he pops
9122 2018-07-28 18:04:37 Marketing is all about the snake oil :p It's very insidious.

9125 2018-07-28 18:04:09 I’m getting my oil changed and I’ve been here since 11am the are just now getting to my car at 2pm
9126 2018-07-28 18:03:58 It does. Love it! 
However, we both know it is applied to the lashline and follicles - not the eyelashes or brows themselves.  
Organic castor oil on a lash spool works almost as well applied to lashes and brows (and scalp). 
It costs $15 a year versus $1600. 
9127 2018-07-28 18:03:58 baby let me oil you from your shoulders down 
9128 2018-07-28 18:03:55 Very concerned but the first one, definitely not. 
The other three, they are possible candidates to be the leaders of Britain. Of those, two flaky elitist #OldEtonian snake oil sellers.
They are the danger. Farage's space has been retaken by the Tories.

9131 2018-07-28 18:02:50 Yes Achvmnts!!Very Big!! MMS nevr bowed before US but Modi govt bowed&Cut Oil Imports frm Iran.Recently Bowed before China&removed ref.of Taiwan frm its website.Malaysia started showing eyes&refused to hand over Jakir Naik.Nepal,Maldives drifting away!Do u require more achvmnts?
9132 2018-07-28 18:02:46 Saddam did not give his larger population much much benefit from oil, smaller Kuvwait had more, that’s why it was invaded.
9133 2018-07-28 18:02:42 Yes, I am aware of the yuan, and how the plan is to replace the dollar with the yuan, though i don't think the yuan will  be solely linked to oil given how China is developing renewables. I actually think it will be sooner than 5 years.
9134 2018-07-28 18:02:37 Mix one part tea tree oil and nine parts water in a spray bottle, do your usual routine, and spritz your face lightly, and pat it dry, don't rub. It's great for your back as well! Worked wonders for me in High school. But don't ever let undiluted TT oil touch your skin though!
9135 2018-07-28 18:02:27 My dad said I should “go get my car looked at” bc “the brake light is on” and if my “brakes fail I could die” plus I definitely “need an oil change” suuuurrrreeeeeeeee. (Jk I totally went to a mechanic my car is fine now, just needed brake fluid & an oil change) I’m adultish!!!
9136 2018-07-28 18:02:24 I am for sustainable energy, I am sure even the oil giants would want that too if they could be apart of it. But forcing it through taxation is not the answer.
9137 2018-07-28 18:02:21 Lie Lie LIES that all that comes out of this S ale Oil Salesman !!! GOD BLESS America 
9138 2018-07-28 18:02:04 Agree that there were leakages in DBT.  But this savings of 146 k crore (as per ur data) is due to low price of crude oil.
9139 2018-07-28 18:02:03 It is incredible just how many flag waving tea bagger right wing numbskulls are still insisting that climate change is a hoax and that the arctic ice sheet is growing like never before. They are obviously sycophants to Big Oil. 
9140 2018-07-28 18:02:03 @zerohedge brent oil??? Short and buy??

9144 2018-07-28 18:01:32 Went in for an oil change & turns out I need new breaks too 
9145 2018-07-28 18:01:31 There are two differences. 1. They say to use pancake mixture but you have to add oil when making the waffles 2. You use a waffle press to make waffles and a flat top to make pancakes. So saying that pancakes and waffles are the same is only partially true.
9146 2018-07-28 18:01:31 Well all I can say is.......'it must be the size of a bloomin pumpkin for that price'.......bet it tastes divine though! Stuff it, and pop it in the oven drizzled with garlic oil! Mmmmm!
9147 2018-07-28 18:01:30 But i have a friend too who fries it with oil and oil ikiiva na ni tamu

9150 2018-07-28 18:01:22 น่ากลัวโคตร
9151 2018-07-28 18:01:17 Getting oil changed for the first time. This family owned place has paper taped the walls everywhere with all caps text... Not sure I'll be back... I think I'm just going to stick to the dealer.
9152 2018-07-28 18:01:10 Yeah I'm gonna start drinking waaaaay more water, and I should definitely work on eating better. And for the lavender, peppermint, and tea tree oil - do you just mix all three together?! I currently use Lush's Grease Lightning (aloe and tea tree) and it does nothing for me. 
9153 2018-07-28 18:01:00 Obviously, this is the writer opinion. As he did not provide a single reason why proposed legislations cause declines in oil investments. The article did not account for the fact that Canadian exploration is more capital intensive therefore price short fall affect us more.
9154 2018-07-28 18:00:56 I had this same issue for a week straight and i HATED it. Only thing that helps me is a noisemaker machine and an oil diffuser with lavender.
9155 2018-07-28 18:00:45 This should be a cover reason,but there's more than what meets the eye.
9156 2018-07-28 18:00:41 Not many people from the states have. It's because the states tax every export into Canada, despite the fact that we are the source of about 80% of the oil in the USA these days... It's kinda stupid in my opinion, but the last prime minister here was the one to agree to it
9157 2018-07-28 18:00:36 Can’t believe I forgot my headphones, knowing I had to get my oil changed

9163 2018-07-28 17:59:20 Norway’s got a huge sovereign wealth fund that’s funded with oil revenues. They share the wealth. Not much inequality.

Immigration from Norway was mostly in the 1800s when it was poor, pre-industrial & had major crop failures. No one’s leaving now that it’s affluent & socialist.
9164 2018-07-28 17:58:53 Think China increasing it,new pipeline-is that wrong? Russia has large oil deposits,China large gold deposits. Russia is an advisor on OPEC board. Bankers are whores who will lay with anyone who has a buck. China has Shanghai energy exchange & precious metal exhange in London. 1
9165 2018-07-28 17:58:43 Obama was nothing more than a useless snake oil salesman. He should have been embarrassed every time he picked up his paycheck.
9166 2018-07-28 17:58:42 My grown grandchildren don't smoke anythong but they are the ones that found you as a valid source for CBD oil, syrup, and @ACTIV8CBD freeze. BTW. Freeze was allowed in the operating room this week for me by my anesthesiologist. It was a big deal:)

9169 2018-07-28 17:58:33 At the mechanic & he says, yeaah you were real low on oil. Nigga I know, that’s why I’m here to get an oil change? tf
9170 2018-07-28 17:58:26 Hopefully! If you've got some down time always feel free to swing by Contessa's set up. Big amazing space dedicated to creating an inclusive atmosphere over in Lucas Oil. :D
9171 2018-07-28 17:58:20 I have cystic acne and what helped me was drinking a shit ton of water and eating healthier (I eat like 85-90% raw)! I also use lavender, peppermint, and tea tree oil as spot treatment!
9172 2018-07-28 17:58:15 what if you just wanted to see @nelward64 live but your friend's car's engine said "more oil please"

9174 2018-07-28 17:57:53 Wait. There's a bj week and an anal week? Also, this HAS to be a joke--the 'I feel weird because the olive oil is extra virgin' CAN'T be a real reason for anything ass-related.
9175 2018-07-28 17:57:43 i guess the best adult advice is always keep a bottle of olive oil in your house
9176 2018-07-28 17:57:41 i think gamit ka Castor oil hehe
9177 2018-07-28 17:57:27 This is like betting against standard oil owned by rocker fellers.  Big incentives aren’t there

9179 2018-07-28 17:57:10 there is no "THEM" in "AMERICA," but there is a "ME" and an "I".

there's also no "GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY" in "AMERICA," nor is there a "FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION." but there probably should be, given how many oil refineries we have.

9183 2018-07-28 17:56:25 You should read up about how the macro economy works. Especially with regards to a sovereign currency such as UK.
Also, you should do some reading into the background of what happens in an oil dependent economy, especially one where CIA interferes like Venezuela!

9198 2018-07-28 17:55:02 I don’t think you will see the majors investing in refinery capacity. It saved them when oil prices fell. As oil prices rise and refinery margins fall, the majors will start to sell their refineries again. Like they did last time refinery margins sank

Too much of our capital ends up in overseas banks and investment firms, and oil rich countries. Are US politicians trying to bankrupt our government?

9260 2018-07-28 17:45:27 Climate alarmism is much more irresponsible. I recall lineups at gas stations in the 1970s because most scientists believed we would be out of oil by 2000. Climate alarmist predictions never come true, either. Like doomsday profits who keep moving the end dates as they pass by.

Is the plan to do that so Deji’s punches slide off?
9297 2018-07-28 17:41:55 The olive oil business?
9298 2018-07-28 17:41:50 I think you’ll find most of this was either already discovered & is only now being announced, or is what is known as “tight oil” eg shales, heavy oil etc which is noted for its high production costs & low net energy. Peak of oil discovery was in the 1960s.
9299 2018-07-28 17:41:41 If you find Oil at the same time existing countries are facing troubles or risk with importing OPEC oil then you might fetch a premium for selling your oil domestically or exporting it. Argentina has a lot of un-tapped heavy oil.
9300 2018-07-28 17:41:32 A guy just walked in and asked to have his oil changed. I said, “sure, no problem, I’ll pull your car in now.” He looks me dead in the eyes and says “well idk if I want one yet...can I make an appointment for 2:30? And I might come back.” I was like ya sure whatever you’d like.
9301 2018-07-28 17:41:30 Mmmh, the amount of curses Nigerian Twitter users have poured on ACP Yomi Shogunle over his insensitive #EndSARS comment enh. He may need to go & wash his head sharply with holy water & anointing oil, before Edo witches kuku add their own curses join.
9302 2018-07-28 17:41:29 I guess oil spills don’t help much either. What a tragedy.
9303 2018-07-28 17:41:24 Why is it that you fear monger the American people of the actions of 9/11 when yourself and administration does NOTHING to the perpetrators of 9/11? Saudi Arabia are not on your banned list! It must be all that sweet oil/ money they filter in the US! Liar in chief!
9304 2018-07-28 17:41:07 They do have a plan, the debt level is a fraction of the level at which it compromises the budget. The alternative was to savage the economy as it was roiled by global oil restructuring, drive unemployment up and hope for recovery over the next decades.
9305 2018-07-28 17:40:45 The fake vibes you gotta run from it
9306 2018-07-28 17:40:41 What amazes me is the state of em and they’re arguing about cheating or who’s the Daddy! I’m no oil painting I know but how do they have people fighting over them?!  x
9307 2018-07-28 17:40:36 Marathi guys and good looks are like oil & water tbh
9308 2018-07-28 17:40:35 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
9309 2018-07-28 17:40:28 How every conversation goes with my dad:

Me: hi

Dad: HAVE YOU BEEN CHECKING THE OIL IN THAT CAR????
9310 2018-07-28 17:40:22 At the car dealership getting an oil change. The Beatles come on. My foot starts tapping along to “Eight Days A Week.” The worst music tricks your body into thinking it sounds good.
9311 2018-07-28 17:40:16 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
9312 2018-07-28 17:40:07 Man you know I got it. I’m opening a store in Raleigh now. & different prices $5.99-$8.99. I know you cheap so you might just get regular oil 
9313 2018-07-28 17:39:52 The tar sands in the last go around was a crash waiting to happen! The Alberta gov (Conservatives) told the oil companies to have a shovel in the ground by 2017 to enjoy some great tax breaks creating a black gold rush. The mega projects could not survive a drop in oil prices.
9314 2018-07-28 17:39:51 Depends on what needs to be done. For a simple wash day 1-2 or 3 hours. For deep conditioning, protein treatments, and/or hot oil treatments 1-4 or 5 hours

9316 2018-07-28 17:39:47 What about the rest of the gas tax and oil company profits? 

When oil dropped to $50 a barrel, gas prices dropped to $0.80/L. Gas is now $1.30/L and yet the price per barrel is still $50
9317 2018-07-28 17:39:43 That’s the effect of a dictatorship, not socialism. There are many factors involved, the greatest problem is oil prices. Venezuela entered a recession and couldn’t recover as oil prices were so low. Your President wants to be a dictator, way more dangerous than social safety nets
9318 2018-07-28 17:39:36 You put motor oil in your motor. What else would you put in your fish? 

#SoundLogic
9319 2018-07-28 17:39:34 So,  because the US wants to keep buying venezuela oil (and paying good money for it) then somehow that has sinked the economy?
9320 2018-07-28 17:39:32 #Hungary and #Poland started "rioting" earlier than Trump's supporters 
9321 2018-07-28 17:39:28 How about we just get the addicts on Extreme oil and Holy oil? they stop addictions PERIOD. I've watched it happen. The Extreme oil stops addictions on the 1st dose to oxy, meth, heroin and more. CANNABIS CURES.
9322 2018-07-28 17:39:11 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

9326 2018-07-28 17:38:43 adulting waiting for this oil change 
9327 2018-07-28 17:38:31 Please tell people about cannabis oil! My 14 year old dog had very aggressive lymphoma and was given 4-6 months, he ended up living a healthy 18 months thanks to high CBD RSO oil. Our vet was shocked. Can’t guarantee same results, but I truly believe in it now.
9328 2018-07-28 17:38:13 ちなさんの歌う「ウソツキ」は何度きいても良い。
9329 2018-07-28 17:38:02 I've been patiently waiting for way too long

9332 2018-07-28 17:37:48 They're made of titanium. Imagine frying chicken without oil.
9333 2018-07-28 17:37:43 The stallion gets a blend of cut grass and some other stuff. He has a buffet and it’s always available. He has always been very picky and he is served 3 different products + soaked vitamins, oil and carrot smoothies every day! I’m never bored!
9334 2018-07-28 17:37:33 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9335 2018-07-28 17:37:27 One can also look at population to see how this GDP is divided per capita. Iran has a population 3 times of Saudi or 8 times of UAE. This shows exactly how an economy is performing. Iran is in poverty with a crippled economy.Anyone who says oil don’t forget Iran has more than uae
9336 2018-07-28 17:37:27 Russia has oil. War is profitable for weapons manufacturers ie guns. Big Oil & guns are running this country. He threw in the wall as raw meat for his base. They don’t realize they will be trapped here; no escape from US to Mexico in their future
9337 2018-07-28 17:37:26 - wash your face day & night 
- use a little bit of coconut oil on it 
- toner ! 
- moisturize 
- dry lots of water
- put on a hydrating mask 
- eat healthy 
- hope y’all enjoyed 
9338 2018-07-28 17:37:14 there was a 4-month period in my life where my favorite snack was a piece of bread pan fried in oil and im really not sure how I managed to stay severely underweight for so long

9341 2018-07-28 17:37:01 You need some moisturizing lotion not just oil
9342 2018-07-28 17:37:00 And we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan countries that had nothing what so ever to do with the attacks on our country.  Instead we gave the saudis better oil deals,  no sanctions, and greater access to America.  Shut the hell up.
9343 2018-07-28 17:36:54 nah we are using soft chalky ones which are... much better for figurative work tbh but the teacher is  All About The Abstraction so the whole thing is giving me a headache

tho tbh?? oil pastels??? those thick motherfuckers?? i don't get them either
9344 2018-07-28 17:36:29 Your tooth brush is celebrating one(1) year anniversary   but you buy data bundles every week, my friend   , you need 20 litres of anointing oil and ten years of fasting and deliverance .... 

9345 2018-07-28 17:36:19 Socialism is snake oil sold by charlatans to ppl who don't understand economics/human nature, this is why nothing they do ever works as intended.  If socialists truly "cared" for the poor they would give from their own pockets instead of using the gov to steal from everyone else.
9346 2018-07-28 17:36:06 If the issued shares are sold out, and you decrease the supply and then you discover oil or gas and cash flows increase, demand should drive up the company share price. Each 3 months from July 24, 25% of 77million shares in escrow are unlocked to trade. #PentaNova
9347 2018-07-28 17:36:00 @JoeVargas how many rt's for a free bottle of cbd oil so I can work pain free for a while?
9348 2018-07-28 17:35:54 Quite a good article, really. Kinda matches my experience, first as an observer with M3, but also as someone who has whalewatched, both from boats and onshore. I have also commented on enhancing whalewatching regulations over the years, and try to protect orcas from oil spills.
9349 2018-07-28 17:35:47 Having a mini spa evening. My hair is soaked in oil, I'm sheet masking and watching Batman Under the Red Hood.
9350 2018-07-28 17:35:40 You’re aware what miseries Hugo Chavez & his chosen successors are subjecting the Venezuelan people to? 

They have the world’s largest proven oil reserves but sadly not enough food or basic medicines for their people. 

So much for working for the Venezuelan people.
9351 2018-07-28 17:35:34 WTF is a "far-right Democrat"?
9352 2018-07-28 17:34:59 I can’t wait til i get a man to take the trash out for me. Cuz i hate it. That’s probably gonna be his only purpose. And taking my car for an oil change. 
9353 2018-07-28 17:34:56 I just came to get my oil change dassit 
9354 2018-07-28 17:34:52 the automotive industry has gasoline or oil base has their lives numbered in less than 10 years there will be a big change in this sector
9355 2018-07-28 17:34:47 New products sometimes give your skin a shake if it's the oil they go that little bit deeper in the skin my moms Botox lady said oils penetrate the skin more than regular creams i would say keep an eye on it though either way
9356 2018-07-28 17:34:36 はっ、来週８月だったのか
9357 2018-07-28 17:34:27 That's what "progressives" want, turn back to medieval cultural behavior
9358 2018-07-28 17:34:20 Don't like oil. Ride a bike. How many ready for this?
9359 2018-07-28 17:33:59 .....threatened to create an African Dollar to trade African oil.  This would have put the American dollar at risk.
9360 2018-07-28 17:33:58 แผนพังทุกอย่างเลยวุ้ย
9361 2018-07-28 17:33:46 อยากให้ลูกเรียน รด แต่ดูไปดูมา ก็เรื่องเยอะๆๆเหมือนกันนะเนี่ยกลัวลูกเข้าป่าเข้ารกจะไปโหนต้นไม้เกาะนู้นนั่นไปเรื่อย ความอิแม่นี้กลัวลูกเป็นแผล
9362 2018-07-28 17:33:32 No he didn't. There's no evidence he ever gassed his own ppl. The US made that up for regime change purposes, as they always do. They have oil interests there and are guarding Syrian oil fields.
9363 2018-07-28 17:33:18 It seems like a race to me. The sooner we get out of this mess the better. Before you know it Whisky Harris Tweed Forfar Briddies Kirriemuir Ginger Bread Aberdeen Angus beef will all be British. Just like tunnocks tea cakes and oil!
9364 2018-07-28 17:33:11 It’s ridiculous how many different choices of olive oil there are
9365 2018-07-28 17:32:54 
Argan oil is a plant oil produced from the kernels of the argan tree (Argania spinosa L.) that is endemic to Morocco. In Morocco, argan oil is used to dip bread in at breakfast or to drizzle on couscous or pasta. It is also used for cosmetic purposes.
9366 2018-07-28 17:32:48 I really just drove an hour away bc I bought a Groupon deal for an oil change & didnt realize it’s for certain locations 
9367 2018-07-28 17:32:44 نعالي بوجه كل متصيهن
9368 2018-07-28 17:32:37 logically, their over reliance on oil caused it. Venezuela is rich in oil. But when oil prices were one shook, it didn't mean to be shook only on Venezuela's economy!
9369 2018-07-28 17:32:35 fake ass pic lmao it looks cute from what i can see . oil your scalp everyday it’ll get better
9370 2018-07-28 17:32:20 @pollentia_12 안녕하세용~~ 트친소 흔적 남기셨길래 찾아왔어요
9371 2018-07-28 17:32:18 Good name for a band
9372 2018-07-28 17:32:14 It’s literally called “walking the talk”.   She’s a relentless force in the face of wildfires, cheap oil, broken or missing infrastructure among other geopolitical issues.  Putting a floor under the recession & investing into key infrastructure projects to drive the economy.
9373 2018-07-28 17:31:59 And your skin must be radiant. Apply some tissue oil if it's dry
9374 2018-07-28 17:31:58 @Cotton_Ttired 안녕하세용 트친소 흔적 타구 왔어용
9375 2018-07-28 17:31:58 also, y'know, smells like a snake oil salesman
9376 2018-07-28 17:31:55 peak my brand is shopping for winter coats online while sitting by a pool covered in SPF 4 and deep tanning oil
9377 2018-07-28 17:31:42 its oil...not wall
9378 2018-07-28 17:31:02 So I learned how to do my own oil change yesterday and now I think the next think ima try and learn is change my brakes on my car that I think ima need soon
9379 2018-07-28 17:30:48 Don’t know what all the fuss is about Hamilton being sponsored by a cannabis oil firm. Rangers have been run by snake oil salesmen for some time and no one’s batter an eyelid @Oldfirmfacts1 @offtheballbbc
9380 2018-07-28 17:30:39 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.1Ki 17:14
9381 2018-07-28 17:30:30 Low wages, soon to come oil drilling off coast,polluted water, cant say Climate Change,unaffordable housing for families
9382 2018-07-28 17:30:25 You left out the oil embargo, massive energy shortages, failure of large auto to compete in timely manner

"Cost-push inflation"

 Nixon's abrupt move to take  off gold standard '71 opened up can of worms that devalued  by 1/3 70s & was beg of a riskier system for U.S.
9383 2018-07-28 17:30:24 I put olive oil in mine, with a good amount Moroccan Argan oil conditioner, lots of water and it works well. I spray it on, right before a wash n go, if I’m doing a twist out I’ll spray the stuff in my bottle and then put Camille rose curl cream on with it to keep it moisturized.
9384 2018-07-28 17:30:20 @1wNGyFf9tPQK49J 트친소 흔적 따라 왔어용
9385 2018-07-28 17:30:10 Switched sides as ISIS can’t pay their fighters no more. Oil prices too high for black market and they have ran out of ancient artefacts to sell.
9386 2018-07-28 17:30:03 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.1Ki 17:12
9387 2018-07-28 17:29:57 I broke every yolk of my over medium eggs and had oil pop at my face. How’s your morning going 
9388 2018-07-28 17:29:57 yasuda ahh~

9392 2018-07-28 17:29:23 That’s a lot of coconut oil to go through! His arms are gonna be very tired, but very muscular!
9393 2018-07-28 17:29:19 The roller coaster ride that is the Alberta economy has been devastating to some folks! I have seen many people invest their saving in small companies only to lose it in the next crash! Big oil & service companies are able to make it  but the little guy goes down each time!
9394 2018-07-28 17:29:13 literally wanna cry bc my printer ran out of ink, my laptop quit working, my car needs an oil change, and my gas lights on! what a great week
9395 2018-07-28 17:28:54 Of course 
9396 2018-07-28 17:28:42 @TheLastLeg #Istitok that United Sates was trending?? What are the sates that have been United? Hunger? Thirst? Oil consumption?
9397 2018-07-28 17:28:41 I smell so good today ....everyday actually but yes shower, oil up, and spray on some perfume will have you smelling yummy
9398 2018-07-28 17:28:40 since electricity is needed to pump water to our homes and to factories that bottle it. Gas station cannot pump without electricity and oil cannot be refined into gas. Food shortages will be swift. We will die. Why?
9399 2018-07-28 17:28:20 The weight of the blame for the economic collapse in Venezuela can be placed on the capitalist elements that controlled the oil industry.
9400 2018-07-28 17:28:18 Coconut oil+Olive oil+ my hair= 
9401 2018-07-28 17:28:11 Might be the black castor oil I just put in my hair
9402 2018-07-28 17:28:09 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
9403 2018-07-28 17:27:14 rosehip oil stink
9404 2018-07-28 17:27:08 I'm not worried or surprised there is water there on Mars. Let me know when they find oil, then I will begin to worry.
9405 2018-07-28 17:27:06 I had 11 o’clock appointment for oil change but why am I still at the dealership
9406 2018-07-28 17:27:01 I’m finally getting my oil changed after like almost a year this mechanic is about beat my ass
9407 2018-07-28 17:26:56 So how does any of them not having an oil block falsifies PMB integrity? You see, you even lack the intellectual capacity to actually determine if the right answer to your question has been given.
9408 2018-07-28 17:26:54 gotta learn to change my own oil now cause i ghosted my mechanic
9409 2018-07-28 17:26:50 Boy she wanted you to put some oil gel on that big pretty dick and it in the hole and bring light and joy
9410 2018-07-28 17:26:46 i have an essential oil blend that smells like fruit loops
9411 2018-07-28 17:26:41 Maybe storybook towns like Lockhart can maintain an economic base, but the majority of rural towns are plagued by boom and bust cycles driven by oil and livestock prices.
9412 2018-07-28 17:26:28 うおお
9413 2018-07-28 17:26:22 1/ Amazing how wide a range of things #keto fixes or improves. When you talk about it w/ people, you end up sounding a bit like a snake oil charlatan, though 

2/ Are we going to turn into super soldiers ? 
9414 2018-07-28 17:26:19 I am not an Igbo man. I am from  one of the oil producing regions that feeds and pay you salary.
9415 2018-07-28 17:26:19 If your down to spend $1000 everytime your car leaks oil then go ahead and get a BMW

9420 2018-07-28 17:25:34 What oil profits! OMG I CANT TAKE THIS BS ANYMORE!
9421 2018-07-28 17:25:21 coffee + honey + coconut oil
= straight shot to my soul
9422 2018-07-28 17:25:06 This is a heartbreaking event going on in the sea world—on several levels. One being that animals also grieve, and , two, the current federal administration thinks lining their pockets with gas and oil profts is more important than saving these magnificent, endangered animals.
9423 2018-07-28 17:25:04 And that has what to do with forcing female children into marriage? Oh right....any excuse to turn the thoughts to some conservative who was a creep to follow the leftie agenda.
9424 2018-07-28 17:25:01 me when I read any post apocalyptic story that has to deal with a water drought or oil depletion: this shit spooky

9428 2018-07-28 17:24:32 Ivanka is close with Dasha Abramovich. Dasha's recent ex husband is Roman Ambramovich. He is Putin's bestie. 
Dasha's dad is oil oligarch Alexander Zhukov. You can't turn around near a trump without tripping over one of Putin's oligarchs. But no,Traitor trump has no ties to Vlad
9429 2018-07-28 17:24:28 A great direction to cut a significant demand for oil is cut plastic, as well as help encourage scope for us to do life differently. I been saying lately we got to think deeper? So maybe less processing, manufacturing, and distribution of what becomes and is essentially garbage.

9431 2018-07-28 17:24:20 My god RoW! You’re not just a pretty plumage! Excellent idea. Maybe motor oil might do it too.
9432 2018-07-28 17:23:56 Lool

I buy the canned one. Or anytime my mumsie is making coconut oil, I steal from her
9433 2018-07-28 17:23:45 Are you sure it was a 
STEeL mill?
You have revived the 
STEaL industry:
•$ pd to Mara Lago
•seizing natn’l parks for big oil
•tax cut for YOU & rich
•NRA favors
•environment- “clean coal”
•peace- promoting racism
•healthcare- pre-existing conditions
•etc

9434 2018-07-28 17:23:39 Is that just oil related e&p or gassy ones too?  Clearly diff dynamics in underlying but...arguably most shunned sector

9436 2018-07-28 17:23:31 Does Iraq have oil? Or not?
9437 2018-07-28 17:23:28 I guess it’s that type of day where I pull out the tanning oil and lay out by my lonely
9438 2018-07-28 17:23:21 If she is plantain, her cheating partner veg oil, I guess you should be the spatula
9439 2018-07-28 17:23:12 1 lane is open. The other will be open once Highways have laid down absorbing grit due to oil on the road
9440 2018-07-28 17:23:07 Supply problems more likely than peak demand for US oil right now. We’ll get the downstream guys on at some point to talk through it. What’s your number for peak US oil demand?
9441 2018-07-28 17:22:59 They target our energy network we (the US and our western allies)target everything that belongs to Russia. Money, oil, natural gas. Without Europe buying their energy, Russia dies. Oh wait, POTUS doesn’t want EU help. Never mind....
9442 2018-07-28 17:22:55 I’m glad I got this oil change done today
9443 2018-07-28 17:22:51 Agree.  There is gear lube, 60 gal or so... but takes a ton of heat to combust that oil
9444 2018-07-28 17:22:47 I just wash my hair with the Pantene shampoo and conditioner then after I just condition it with coconut oil
9445 2018-07-28 17:22:19 Next quarter they will be down. Trying to do business before tariffs went into effect, raised it this quarter. They are talking about major problems in oil industry b/c of tariffs on China
9446 2018-07-28 17:22:04 Reading an “environmental analysis report” from a Candidate in one rural constituency in Zimbabwe and what I see on twitter is oil and water #ZimDecides2018
9447 2018-07-28 17:22:00 This week someone told us there is no housing crisis.

At least OPEC is willing to *admit* there's an oil cartel...

9448 2018-07-28 17:21:58 People asks why this project now after 3ys. Better late than never
Everybody knows what Niger Delta Avengers inflicted on Nig btw 2015/16, oil price down & NASS duress
The project was just approved by NASS & FEC last Nov & co-financier agreed construction terms
Let's b optimistic
9449 2018-07-28 17:21:23 Nah it cannot compare to when ya get that oil and massage 
9450 2018-07-28 17:21:18 coffee + coconut oil + almond milk + @CannabellaKitch honey 
9451 2018-07-28 17:20:55 I started oil pulling and taking apple cider vinegar shots in the name of health but if you ask me to jog a mile with with u I will be like im sorry w h a t

9459 2018-07-28 17:19:39 Thank you. I’m very proud of them all. I always tell people to find a deployed military members family and volunteer to cut the grass, change their oil, invite them to church, lunch  etc., there are so many things a military spouse needs while their partner is deployed.

9461 2018-07-28 17:19:24 Pretty sure I got coconut oil in my eye 
9462 2018-07-28 17:19:22 Also because of chemical and fragrance sensitivities, the large majority of our house cleaning/body care products are scent free/low scent, home made (wax and oil based wood polish), and/or biodegradable/better for the environment when at all possible.
9463 2018-07-28 17:19:12 Environmental efforts. USA is failing badly with climate change, pro oil etc. Jefferson would be turning in his grave.

9467 2018-07-28 17:18:45 Just follow the oil, look at Aramco trying to sell up for 2019.
They need more oil; Iran has some, let's go there. 
Humanity needs to wake up to this shit, all the terrorists use that sect (SA's Wahhabi one). Mass division and confusion and Aramco's dealings are ignored.
9468 2018-07-28 17:18:44 my phone died so i couldn't get any more pics but uh. my house is fucked so we won't be able to go back to it for like... a year i think. full of sewage and oil. everything downstairs is gone
9469 2018-07-28 17:18:44 Yeah fuck those reporter's for thinking Brady 's snake oil salesmen of a trainer could possibly be up to something shady with his clients.
9470 2018-07-28 17:18:41 instead of cooking with butter use coconut oil, or another healthier fat option. Making small changes like this will make a big difference. For those who want to change their eating habits it’s the baby steps. And it’s all about balance

9474 2018-07-28 17:18:24 Pero en España estamos contra el fracking... y los que hablaban del peak oil se han encontrado con que las reservas mundiales son cada año más grandes sin que se les haya caído la cara de vergüenza
9475 2018-07-28 17:18:21 It works in Norway because taxes have been lowered, so companies don’t flag out. But consumers pay heavy Govt. fees on cars, alcohol, tobacco, 25% VAT on almost everything, Heavy Road Toll.

And we have a lot of money from oil and gas.
9476 2018-07-28 17:18:12 Jamaican red pimento oil is also supposed to be good, but I haven’t gotten my hands on it yet
9477 2018-07-28 17:18:01 There's also an art reception at the Cousen Rose #Gallery in #OakBluffs - Oil on Canvas work by painter Joyce Harvey + live #music by Silas Berlin from 6-8pm.
9478 2018-07-28 17:17:39 If stopping child marriage is far right, then I guess I am a far right then.
9479 2018-07-28 17:17:37 @realDonaldTrump Rawest + most primitive form of narcissism. If you say good things about him you are good. If you say critical things you are bad. He's guy who has made a life out of conning + selling snake oil. Anyone that stands between him + lying to people must be removed.
9480 2018-07-28 17:17:34 It’s soooo nice. It has corn oil to really hydrate and real popcorn to give a gentle polish to your skin. Your skin will feel like butter after and it smells amazing
9481 2018-07-28 17:17:23 The true paradox is that liberals believe conservatives are intolerant, because conservatives are intolerant of the violent intolerant

9483 2018-07-28 17:16:50 Oil changed done, first nap of the day done, and grocery shopping done. Now time to start 2 weeks worth of laundry, since I didn't do laundry once home from RWA.
9484 2018-07-28 17:16:48 I'll put this in vegan terms: have you ever had tofu scramble made with coconut oil? Pretty good right? Imagine if it was a wierd color but tasted amazing

9486 2018-07-28 17:16:24 I use 100% pure shea butter.  It doesn't clog pores like coconut oil.

9488 2018-07-28 17:16:03 You could just paraphrase: "Why are we taking on huge debt for wars that kill thousands, including US service members, and enrich the military industrial complex and oil corps, when we could take on much smaller debt to cover education and healthcare and actually help people?"
9489 2018-07-28 17:16:01 attach the ply. remove the oil. flip over and repeat until bright.

9492 2018-07-28 17:15:46 I agree. Why don't the Gulf States support Gaza? I have a theory.They are happy with the status quo.If Israel and the Palestinians came to a deal it would be bad news for the Gulf States.The Palestinians are entrepreneurs, the Gulf States have grown fat and lazy on oil.
9493 2018-07-28 17:15:30 Years ago, my dad made oil paintings using a screwdriver. Not sure why. They were quite good.
9494 2018-07-28 17:15:27 Agreed. They're loaded with oil money, but they do have long term plans to spend it effectively. Especially City, who yes, spend a lot of money on transfers, but their record transfer is still De Bruyne from Wolsburg back in 15/16 for 68m. And they aim young too.

9502 2018-07-28 17:14:36 That’s so corrupt man.. seriously I feel bad for a country with all this wealth of Oil but they don’t know how to rule it.. same as Iraq
9503 2018-07-28 17:14:23 Black castor oil! I massage it into my scalp like 2x a week (v small amt) and spots where my hair was thinning are thickening up again!

9516 2018-07-28 17:13:09 Chris Twitter is handing out blue checks to total morons.  I was in VZ in 1998. It was rich by South American standards. Oil wealth, foreign investment... govt socialists fucked it up...  fact.

9522 2018-07-28 17:11:54 Maybe it’s cuz we value our fans. Maybe it’s because we value tradition. Maybe it’s because we’re not bloated with oil money. Maybe it’s because we develop everyone’s talent. Maybe it’s because we produce the best managers in a tactically evolving league.
9523 2018-07-28 17:11:49 @VinnieTortorich how would you compare olive oil to avocado oil, just as healthy?

9527 2018-07-28 17:11:24 On cultural issues there is no bottom for the left. After they normalize child molestation what will be next? Human sacrifice? Cannibalism?

The slippery slope fallacy is now the slippery slope fact.
9528 2018-07-28 17:11:21 I was leaving home this morning to attend an event at a nice hotel here in Kano. Those children of the house ate everything and left me small dambu, with oil only. In His infinite mercy, in that event God made us eat palatable eatables & drinkables.
9529 2018-07-28 17:11:20 One thing is the real socialism (USSR and satellites), other is the social democracy (western Europe) and other is corruption and looting. Venezuela is just like the other oil producers plus an oligarchy that steals all the oil revenues.

9531 2018-07-28 17:11:14 Trump wants low oil prices. Potentially asks Xi to hold off on stocking up till after the elections.
9532 2018-07-28 17:11:12 Eating at least one serving of green salad containing 30 ml of pure virgin olive oil, 2cloves of garlic and half onion plus letuce and rocket is cardioprotective as I would suppose.
9533 2018-07-28 17:10:43 I never measure how big of a dab I’m gonna do. I just put my tool on the oil and pull. Today I damn near pulled up a half g. I’m gonna sleep great! See you in a few hours.
9534 2018-07-28 17:10:36 Fats fats fats! MCT oil will definitely get it going.
9535 2018-07-28 17:10:29 Lemon slices in water is good for you. Drinking a shot of olive oil everyday is also good for you. You’re young and thinking you’ll live forever but someday you will be 50, 60, and 72 so watch out.

9541 2018-07-28 17:09:57 Apply small portion on the scalp and use shower cap to avoid bedding stains, try to endure for a while. Sieve the onions after blending before adding the castor oil...it worked for someone I know.

9545 2018-07-28 17:09:37 FG raises N748bn from oil tax, royalties in 2017 - DPR
9546 2018-07-28 17:09:36 And what are the shares of oil consumption?
9547 2018-07-28 17:09:32 True. Under Obama we only had the stock market nearly triple, 70+ months of consecutive job growth, became a net exporter of oil for the first time in US history, unemployment fall from 10% to 4.6%,  the longest sustained GDP growth in history, US manufacturing increase, etc...
9548 2018-07-28 17:09:31 They are far right though. And not because if this, because every party in Sweden opposes child marriage. The claim that the governent somehow struggles with this is disinfo.
9549 2018-07-28 17:09:05 Baby oil or coconut oil works a treat, too! Let it soak in for 10 minutes then wipe clean.
9550 2018-07-28 17:09:00 That’s a totally accurate view. Farmington is quite different than the surrounding Nation. Oil & gas oriented.
9551 2018-07-28 17:08:41 Hate waiting for an oil change 
9552 2018-07-28 17:08:33 I'm originally from Venezuela and the streets are filled with American cars due to low oil prices or so it was until I left for good in 2014. My dream car it's actually the Chevrolet Blazer from 1982. No car is cooler than that!

9555 2018-07-28 17:08:01 It wasn't socialism that failed in Venezuela, but placing all bets for the economy on oil, then seeing oil crash.

If you want to see how successful socialism really is, look toward Scandinavian nations like Denmark.

9557 2018-07-28 17:07:38 the agencies will still make the determination of who receives phase IIIs?
9558 2018-07-28 17:07:16 Definitely gotta get my oil changed. Then i think ima shop a little for my new apartment 
9559 2018-07-28 17:07:13 One of the long term effects of the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia is the distinct possibility of it unravelling into a full scale war between the two.
Short term the price of Oil is likely to increase.
If ANY of the Straits are blocked, expect to see $100 / Barrel
9560 2018-07-28 17:07:11 The thieves are the government and they paid off their supporters by taking over private companies and making them State owned. Now those companies are so inefficient that Venezuela is importing oil instead of producing it.

Theft is just another way of describing socialism.
9561 2018-07-28 17:06:58 Here’s a weird twist: some offshore rigs hat are ready to be decommissioned have become reef-like habitat for marine life, so will the oil industry get to leave structures in place? #AAN2018 @SFscribe
9562 2018-07-28 17:06:48 Just tried some of my MRS products in the shower, that Moroccan oil shower gel is something else 
9563 2018-07-28 17:06:23 Yes i take it and its helped so much! I have it in tincture, oil, and even gummy bears and its helped my anxiety a lot i highly recommend, i also havent had a panic attack in a long time either
9564 2018-07-28 17:06:15 The left: Haha, we'd never legalize pedophilia, that's a slippery slope fallacy!
Muslims: Actually, we marry off children all the time
The left: ONLY THE FAR RIGHT IS AGAINST RAPING KIDS
9565 2018-07-28 17:06:12 Why? Why always the US? Let them use some of their oil money... we can help, but we should no longer have to carry the world.
9566 2018-07-28 17:06:02 What has rivers state done for herself?
1- The youths in pH are not willing to put in that extra effort to make it.
2- The government does not want to invest in anything else other than oil.
3- Lagos does not chase business opportunities out with militants and over the top tax

9569 2018-07-28 17:05:49 I had spent 30 yrs in the sun, mostly without sunscreen, Bain de solely and baby oil being the skin preps of choice. Working at a ski area was great for a tan but...
9570 2018-07-28 17:05:48 If you are comparing tyre wear & waste, a pair of road bicycle tyre weighs 500g. Four car tyres weigh 60 to 80 times as much. Car tyres have more fossil oil content than bicycle tyres due to higher stresses. However you look at it the carbon impact is massively better for bikes.
9571 2018-07-28 17:05:40 wtf  carbon tax  punish the oil users  shame them  oil sinners when she was saying this i could invision  the complete collapse of america
9572 2018-07-28 17:05:40 It’s not a partisan issue. Sweden democrats (and others) are spreading disinformation, and unfortunately @politico has fallen for it.
9573 2018-07-28 17:05:32 You can got some Castrol oil. I’m trying to grow my eyebrows bushy  @SauceyTacos

9578 2018-07-28 17:05:05 Pro-Houthi media: coalition warplanes on Saturday struck four fishing boats in the Red Sea killing all fishermen on board. Seems the coalition is killing civilians in revenge for Houthi attacks on Saudi oil tankers.
9579 2018-07-28 17:04:53 No, I wouldn't. Without proper context, even 'accurate' statistics can be made to say anything. Scotland has a surplus of energy, water, foodstuffs, raw materials (incl oil) and educated people. More per capita than most other countries in Europe. How does that GERS?
9580 2018-07-28 17:04:45 I think I used too much coconut oil.
9581 2018-07-28 17:04:43 This coconut oil body lotion smell sooo good

9589 2018-07-28 17:03:36 I do think changes are already gaining ground, but recently the American Heart Association once again ripped coconut oil! Craziness!
9590 2018-07-28 17:03:23 my fear is that Nigeria is going down same road. Now we know oil is a curse, tech firms stole d show since 1999, terrible

9594 2018-07-28 17:02:46 Every time you come get a oil change they come with $200 worth of extra recommendations.  Change my shit so I can go.

9600 2018-07-28 17:02:06 There’s nothing like corn on the cob part cooked on an open old oil tin. Wonderful.
9601 2018-07-28 17:01:58 I think plantain is a woman in the plant world. Focus all your attention on it while frying, it won’t turn brown, small you went to drink water in the fridge. She cheats with vegetable oil and becomes polish. Kmt
9602 2018-07-28 17:01:51 @narendramodi  Increase faciltiy for research im automobile and power sector so the.dependency on the crude oil can be  reduced and we can found the alternate fuel in the country itsself

9604 2018-07-28 17:01:38 Makes you wonder why everyone on the planet hasn’t “seized” on stopping this crime against humanity.
9605 2018-07-28 17:01:13 It’s talk like this that causes hysteria and panic among the general public, as a lot of the country’s gas  is piped through Europe it’s also possible that the EU could stop this and also the oil pipelines will be shut off

9613 2018-07-28 17:00:30 Try sitting upside down. Put coconut oil on your finger tips and massaging your scalp this helps stimulate blood flow to the hair follicles. You can also brush upside down but it’s more effective if you massage your scalp

9635 2018-07-28 16:57:53 16,500,000,000 gallons of oil? 16,000,000,000 pounds of gold?
9636 2018-07-28 16:57:41 Bahaha. You aren’t wrong about the amount, you just ignore that the cons quit paying into it in 87 and started spending it even when oil prices were high. They used the fund to falsely appear to be fiscally responsible. #factsarefun

9726 2018-07-28 16:46:01 Many thanks. The medical people are doing everything they can. They've been brilliant, but things aren't going well. Trying CBD oil as well now - cannabis derived, but legal (it doesn't make you high). It seems to work for several conditions, but there's little solid research yet
9727 2018-07-28 16:45:46 Combine 9 oz cheese with 2 tablespoons Ahi Tuna. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
9728 2018-07-28 16:45:45 - If you want to grow your hair long and fast, put coconut oil all over your hair and leave in for 20-30 minutes then wash out
- Stay away from really tight hairstyles
9729 2018-07-28 16:45:40 And Stryker's the oil finally ran out… the execution of death.
9730 2018-07-28 16:45:35 Coconut oil and the inversion method!
9731 2018-07-28 16:45:16 Oil had a nigga slumped last night
9732 2018-07-28 16:45:05 Thanks for hint, though it’s probably not especially ‘best’ (maybe for you), but up there with other natural options. I alternate coconut oil, olive oil, almond oil for skin. I always use organic. Have a great day
9733 2018-07-28 16:44:59 That photo of Alex is so beautiful, it looks like an oil painting 
9734 2018-07-28 16:44:44 Yo creo que limpiar todo a fondo Paco y supuestamente otra vez en funcionamiento. El gas oil es muy basto y poco refinado, es muy aceitoso y lo habrá embarrao tó, taller y limpieza de inyectores, bomba, toberas y cilindros....
9735 2018-07-28 16:44:43 Once I had an unlabelled jar of homemade citrus/ACV cleaner beside an unlabelled jar of oil and someone was making fritters and I got a talking to about labels after that went as badly as possible

9739 2018-07-28 16:44:14 Lemme go grab this body oil & some Henny then. 
9740 2018-07-28 16:43:53 That is untrue. The Oil Sands are growing. They are subsidised by both the federal and Albertan governments, too. And, as I said, Canada's corporate taxes are low.
9741 2018-07-28 16:43:52 Enacting laws that require children to somewhat approach the age of consent before marriage is a real dogwhistle from the right.

The next thing ya know, those rightist thugs will let women to learn to read, own property and vote.
9742 2018-07-28 16:43:33 You are scraping the barrel. 5cm3 of vegetable oil per 1000 miles against probably a litre of fossil oil you need for the same distance. Any other fallacious comparisons you want to make? Eg where does the surface of your tyres end up? How are the worn tyres disposed of

9747 2018-07-28 16:43:01 Hilarious - Russia will end up being a major source of supply to the US shortly, what's next oil??? OMG, this is like watching a train wreck in super slow motion. Putin getting what he wants from Trump
9748 2018-07-28 16:43:01 俺以上に辞めた方がいい人もいるからあんま言えんけどね
9749 2018-07-28 16:42:56 Recently read a book, admittedly fiction but well researched that postulated oil is not finite nor only created from organic matter, but produced by the earth at great depth.
9750 2018-07-28 16:42:51 Interesting discussion. Problem is in international commerce based in oil, monopolies, in prime matters, China, India and overseas workshops without human rights, big pharma and high technologies in maquilas. all this extracts plusvalue and creates exclusion and starvation zones.
9751 2018-07-28 16:42:51 I think you’ll love it there. Be sure to make good use of Finchley Lido and the cinema there :) Everything here is just dandy. I’m enjoying the states, but im still struggling with the over abundance of corn syrup and palm oil in everything

9755 2018-07-28 16:42:19 IM NEVER GETTING AN OIL CHANGE AGAIN OMG. A $50 oil change is now costing me $120 I hate cars literally going to sell mine 
9756 2018-07-28 16:41:56 I hope he parachutes into a cauldron of hot oil!
9757 2018-07-28 16:41:47 外に置いてある私のバイク大丈夫かな。
9758 2018-07-28 16:41:30 Tea tree and lavender essential oils used topically with jojoba oil as a carrier. Just be light on tea tree oil and don’t let your cats around the area you’ve applied it to while it’s on as tea tree is known to be potentially dangerous for cats. Lavender is safe though.
9759 2018-07-28 16:41:25 I use balsamic a lot as marinade on steak, with lemon zest, thyme, garlic and olive oil
9760 2018-07-28 16:41:15 Trains a bit faster in China, Japan, France etc , too. But America -- sorry oil industry -- wouldn't want that, would they? Prefer to have people sitting in their cars, guzzling gas in traffic jams. Couldn't be in cahoots with Big Pharma could they? All those pills for stress
9761 2018-07-28 16:41:09 What about peak demand for US L48 onshore oil? Why is there only a discussion about peak supply?
9762 2018-07-28 16:41:07 Finally the oil field job iv been wanting 
9763 2018-07-28 16:41:01 Look  at some labels in your own pantry - Refrigerator- Cooking oil - Etc 
Soy this Soy that Soy the Other 
Research on soy in our diet is not good
I have to avoid it Bigly - Migraine Headaches - Thus the Knowledge Of the Mass Amounts if Foods that contain SOY - Cheap Filler!
9764 2018-07-28 16:40:28 some money or be active. What did Saudi Arabia for the Syrian people? Nothing. So at least shut up and waste your oil money till around 2060

Extra virgin olive oil is the healthiest fat on the planet.
It is loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that can fight inflammation

You can also use the same products for your eyebrows every night to make your brows thick and bold

9778 2018-07-28 16:38:59 Baby oil gel and Vaseline for the real. 

Coconut oil when I'm feeling fancy. 

Fuck lotion.
9779 2018-07-28 16:38:58 @PeterAttiaMD I’m sure someone asked you about this, but I can’t find it. Does MCT Oil break my intermittent fast?
9780 2018-07-28 16:38:57 I smell like mango butter and coconut oil *caresess self*
9781 2018-07-28 16:38:55 Oil changes are the worst. Will I spend $30 or will I spend $400 on other parts.
9782 2018-07-28 16:38:55 So guys this is the education of Saudis. Posting a pic with Putin and Rohani and claiming to lick Americans feet. Hahaha your government is doing a great job. Trump wanted you to increase the oil production. Your King said simply yes. If you are so worried about Syrians go donate
9783 2018-07-28 16:38:45 There are little children with seizure disorders that have had to move from my state to Colorado for higher THC oil. They are not dopers or drug addicts. One of them has even talked for the first time due to switching from brain damaging benzos to THC oil.
9784 2018-07-28 16:38:43 Let me get a oil change real quick
9785 2018-07-28 16:38:35 i’m finally getting an oil change 
9786 2018-07-28 16:38:32 8 yrs of terrible leadership.  Lower taxes led to deficits.  Schools awfully underfunded.  Every Republican trick done, and nothing worked for her.  Rightfully seen as puppet of oil & gas bigwigs.  Cuts to mental health, dept of health, environmental protection, ethics dept, etc.
9787 2018-07-28 16:38:17 I don’t care how hot it is I’m putting on oil & lotion
9788 2018-07-28 16:38:16 I will pour the engine oil away,  you are not going anywhere 
9789 2018-07-28 16:38:09 Cannabis oil kills cancer, many have success stories.
9790 2018-07-28 16:38:05 Yrah, it's dough + yeast, mixed, rolled and cut. Bake a rack for 15 minutes then dunk them in boiling veggie oil for a minute. Drown them in liquid sugar and stick them on a rack. Pretty gross to watch tbh.
9791 2018-07-28 16:38:04 ในที่สุดก็มีแฟนแคมลิซ่าโซโล่แดนซ์ชัดๆ ฮรืออออ เนี่ยแหละ เต้นมันต้องดูใกล้ๆว้อยยย ของจริงยิ่งแล้วใหญ่ แม่มึงมันมีดีเทลมากกว่าที่เห็นไกลๆเยอะอ่ะ ลิซซซซซซซ
9792 2018-07-28 16:38:00 I wouldn’t have time to eat my free ice cream if my oil changes only took 44 seconds.
9793 2018-07-28 16:38:00 an essential oil soap called Morning Wood? Saw it at the farmers market.
9794 2018-07-28 16:37:50 How many of those countries have militaries even close to our size? List the population sizes. List the foreign aid those countries receive. List how much foreign aid we provide to them. And list if they are funded by government run oil industry. Let’s have a real discussion 
9795 2018-07-28 16:37:43 My day was ruined because the mechanic told me “your uses synthetic oil that’ll be an extra $60.” F off... 
9796 2018-07-28 16:37:41 Just to clarify - all the pieces in my exhibition are acrylics . The process is to paint the picture by hand - oil or acrylic on canvas . Then photograph it . Edit it and finally to print it on to a thin sheet of acrylic resin which hardens to a high finish and beautiful tile .
9797 2018-07-28 16:37:28 I love Sepia photos. And B&W.
I'd momentarily forgotten about your interest in early England, ships etc.  I reckon you would enjoy this book too. But it's not heavy if that's your preference. This book covers early times, discovery of oil & onwards. I don't have much left to read
9798 2018-07-28 16:37:25 I made my own avocado and coconut oil conditioner & my hair feels so soft! 
9799 2018-07-28 16:37:24 use bio oil and St ives 
9800 2018-07-28 16:37:24 Waiting for my car...how long does it take to do an oil change? I’m sooooooo bored!
9801 2018-07-28 16:37:23 Libelous articles and propaganda Oatar owned media like this, shows why there is almost absolutely no cientific, literary, technological,  political, or HR contribution  to the world by any oil  filthy rich Muslim country but terrorism, ignorance, women slavery & intolerance.
9802 2018-07-28 16:37:22 Taking fish oil is great and everything, until you realize all your burps are now fishy.
9803 2018-07-28 16:37:14 The last thing you want is the cleaning person judging you a slob. Additionally, I wash the car before bringing it in for an oil change.
9804 2018-07-28 16:37:09 Awk bore off with the fsg saved us from administration crap. Liverpool was one of the biggest teams on world football and they bought us way underprice to make a huge profit. I don't think they are the worst owners but they are far from the best. I don't want oil money owners...
9805 2018-07-28 16:37:06 It's super scary to think that hair companies are using chemicals to kill off black people but it's true and honestly if you're going natural PLEASE read what's in it + stick to more organic products that can moisturize your hair I.e. coconut oil
9806 2018-07-28 16:37:00 Cook it with coconut oil.  You can scrape it into the garbage can easier that way.
9807 2018-07-28 16:36:50 たべたいよぉおおおおおおおおおおお
9808 2018-07-28 16:36:49 Getting my windshield replaced and my oil changed. Other humans are annoying me though. Figure out what you need, but most importantly: Get! Out! Of! My! Way! 
9809 2018-07-28 16:36:44 That’s is laughable. Remember when oil left Alberta cause the price per barrel dropped? Prentice promised cutbacks, austerity and harsh realities for middle income earners. He offered no help, only a tightening of the belt. NDP offered and delivered better alternatives.
9810 2018-07-28 16:36:33 And SLB agrees with that.  There is oil supply tightness. Here is from Paul Kibsgaard.
The fundamentals of the global oil market continue to evolve favorably for our international business as the balance of crude oil supply and demand tightens further.

9815 2018-07-28 16:36:04 Because you purchased some fry extract essential oil for your diffuser?
9816 2018-07-28 16:35:55 It's the peanut oil they cook that shit in. It is addicting.
9817 2018-07-28 16:35:54 While I lay here, let’s talk about caprylic/capric triglyceride. If you look at your skin care products, I’m positive it is in at least one of them. This is an Esther of coconut oil and glycerin. It’s super light but works as an emollient and dispersing agent and solvent.

9823 2018-07-28 16:35:16 Hahaha what a fucking joke. Hejaz is part of Saudi Arabia and it'll be for a long time, deal with it. As for oil it'll lose its power before it runs out so don't even think about it.
9824 2018-07-28 16:35:09 Omg Stella is poppin . New brakes & oil ! She’s ready for Orlando 
9825 2018-07-28 16:34:44 I use wild growth hair oil from the hair store, you could also used jojoba oil mixed with coconut oil & warm it up a lil.

9828 2018-07-28 16:34:22 CBD is only ONE element of hundreds in cannabis that can stop addiction. We need the whole buds. Terpenes are also in the buds. The Extreme oil is whole cannabis oil concentrated 28:1. It stops addictions on the 1st dose. The Holy oil works too. God bless.

9831 2018-07-28 16:33:49 Who needs cable when I can watch you eat a s__t sandwich for your oblivious virtue signaling. Take a look around your office Ross and count how many items were extracted, produced, shipped or powered using FF/oil and then proceed to stop talking.
9832 2018-07-28 16:33:45 @realDonaldTrump need to do something about price fixing/gouging oil companies.  Gasoline costs are ridiculous and I am an oil field worker.  More oil than ever in America.  What the hell is going on?!
9833 2018-07-28 16:33:31 It is a bit lame but what about the huge price gap on  heavy oil being shipped to the  compared to WTI bbl price.  is getting hosed!
9834 2018-07-28 16:33:29 Would be pretty for her to produce her mileage from her oil change receipts.

9851 2018-07-28 16:31:35 I used to spend money on musical equipment. Now it’s gear oil, gaskets, filters, exotic looking tools, and service manuals. I wish I had gotten this much enjoyment from engine repair when I was a teenager. #BetterLateThanNever #CareerSwitchImminent

9853 2018-07-28 16:31:27 I have been working with CBD oil made of industrial hemp in Sweden now for 7 years. Sweden even tryies to make that plant classified ”drog”.. Magic natural medicin..!

9855 2018-07-28 16:31:12 I was and in all honesty my dad was a mechanic for over 50 years and he made sure all his girls knew the basics of car care. For me I asked him how to do more like oil changes & changing sparks plugs. But it made my day!
9856 2018-07-28 16:30:48 Assuming a large share of oil vehicles switched to hydrogen fuel cell ones of course.

9859 2018-07-28 16:30:23 Love reading all the ignorant liberal comments on this. They still don't understand that most products they use are from oil. "Clean" energy is expensive and funded by taxpayer subsidies which means it is inefficient. No more subsidies for failing companies.

9881 2018-07-28 16:27:27 Ontario's contribution to 'climate change' is so insignificantly small it could have no measurable impact on the global situation.

(speculation) If Oil can't export past Iran, from closed shipping lanes Oil goes to $200 overnight. Sur de Rio has 200,000,000 recoverable that would be worth 400 Billion on paper overnight. A $12 Million company controlling $400 Billion is interesting, yes

9998 2018-07-28 16:10:12 There are some cases where individual refineries export oil, simply because international markets are closer logistically than domestic ones, but there are other areas of the US where the volumes imported are vastly larger than any amount exported.

10003 2018-07-28 16:10:05 The baby was mixed, seemed blasian. So the baby’s hair was like 3 a/b. And it did its job but the baby’s head just looked super slick as you can imagine baby oil gel would do. That definitely wouldn’t work on my hair but it was interesting to see.
10004 2018-07-28 16:10:03 Dear @GateRestaurant 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
10005 2018-07-28 16:10:01 I know I take my car to the shop every 6 months or 5,000 miles and I just do whatever they tell me to do and my car runs fine.

I let my lawnmower stop working halfway through getting the yard cut before considering that changing the oil is required.

10007 2018-07-28 16:09:57 If we ever get the promised rain, remember it will bring all the oil to the surface making the roads slippery.
10008 2018-07-28 16:09:56 If you ever thought Arabia etc was about oil you'd be right!  LOL.
