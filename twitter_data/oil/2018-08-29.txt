9 2018-08-29 23:58:40 So your saying Putin got trump in power so trump can make our military bigger 1.4 trillion in 2 years, let America retake oil exports globally , arm Ukraine, and intervene in Syria and ruining Russia’s plan in the Middle East, not to mention sanctioning Russia , you make no sense

11 2018-08-29 23:58:17 What’s the point you are trying to steer us to?  Expansion of the oil sands is pretty much done so why does it matter that Shell sold out to Canadians? Quit the daily demonization of the NDP.  If all you have is cut taxes so the rich get richer you won’t have my vote.

142 2018-08-29 23:41:45 And some therapies, by relieving pressure & pain you've normalized, such as chiropractics or acupuncture, also address pain.

Is there snake oil? Tons. Almost inherent in some of the best options.

Herbs/supplements coming from China & elsewhere found to be laced w/drugs.
143 2018-08-29 23:41:26 The stuff I have doesn't explicitly say it's oil based, but given the cleanup instructions call for mineral spirits, that seems to be the case.
144 2018-08-29 23:41:09 We allow chewing tobacco on a baseball field but not CBD oil in Ohio. What a effing joke.
145 2018-08-29 23:41:01 Up next: buffalo sauce, fruit leather, and baby oil, which contain no bison, hide, or infants.
146 2018-08-29 23:41:01 It is encouraging to know that more and more people are starting to see thru the Yankee Snake Oil Salesman.   Too yellow to debate his opponent.  That boy is worthless.

148 2018-08-29 23:40:56 Really it was Scottish oil that kept UK afloat after all a US economist did say Little Britain had very little to offer the world without Scotlands resources
149 2018-08-29 23:40:39 If u r wondering how u made it up to this stage it's almighty that  anointed u with the oil. That is Why u pray n things miracle happens. U r blessed not because u're perfect but because u r anointed that is why everything is connected to u. Stay Blessed

153 2018-08-29 23:40:31 in Nigeria Oil spills are bad because it pollutes the water that the people drink
154 2018-08-29 23:40:26 That face oil is amazing if you can stand the smell 
155 2018-08-29 23:40:24 Oh no, the motor oil is going to be drunk well past this month.
156 2018-08-29 23:40:24 Yes they need a good Judge .  There is no scientific proof there are too many horses there and they'll put 200 herd of cattle there anyway or frack for oil. 
Makes no sense . Regardless of what the BLM says there is NO guarantee those horses will go to good homes !
157 2018-08-29 23:40:20 Big Monkey parasite! All your hope is in Crude Oil.
158 2018-08-29 23:40:16 #orangutanjungleschool  Come on @asda @sainsburys @MorrisonsNews @waitrose @Tesco  time to get rid of palm oil in all products please, it's almost impossible to find food products without palm oil, you need to do more about this important issue.

163 2018-08-29 23:39:53 Someone should tell the radio advertisers who have CBD oil commercials running every 10 minutes on the sports talk station.
164 2018-08-29 23:39:52 Across multiple social media and big tech platforms, conservative voices are being silenced and censored. Lest they believe they are “too big to be broken up,” remember Standard Oil. But it’s my belief God can quickly even the score.
165 2018-08-29 23:39:42 Just trying to get some oil this weekend. 
166 2018-08-29 23:39:39 I need some thc oil. But nobody know shit. Is there a site to order? Asking for me
167 2018-08-29 23:39:36 I kno my wife somewhere out there dressing dope as fuck getting ripped off the big oil
168 2018-08-29 23:39:33 Morning beloved hope u had a great nite. Fear cannot make u loose ur oil, U can lose ur job, relationships n much more but don't lose your oil the oil is very important. When u lose ur oil, u lose ur opportunity
169 2018-08-29 23:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
170 2018-08-29 23:38:57 Oil per barrel went down and gas goes up. Price gauging.............
171 2018-08-29 23:38:50 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .
172 2018-08-29 23:38:45 Got oil? The anointing and you...#cuttingitrightbiblestudy
8:30 tonight
173 2018-08-29 23:38:43 Looks smooth to me.
174 2018-08-29 23:38:24 This happened in the 20s / Reefer Madness, if only we could use hemp oil to create "plastic" instead of petrochemicals, we could save the planet.
Cooking oil, car oil, makeup, shampoos, clothes, shoe laces, boat sails, shade sails, etc. Best of all, it grows like a weed 
175 2018-08-29 23:38:18 They use it as leverage whenever they have a political spat with us. When oil was discovered there it hotted up somewhat.
176 2018-08-29 23:38:15 Does that mean only oil deals will have done Nigeria the good it deserves if only I may ask why ar the Nigerians in the oil sectors the most billionaires ..? Because it's all for embezzlement. #istandwithbuhari he's better for Nigeria's future

179 2018-08-29 23:38:01 Ya real good. We have trade issues with our neighbours to the south, internal issues where we continue to struggle to get our assets such as oil to market, and your pretending you did a hard days work by learning how a factory works. #canadianeconomyissues4life

181 2018-08-29 23:37:35 Newsom is a snake oil salesmen , universal access means you’ll get to see a doctor sooner or later. Probably later when  it’s to late . His buddy Obama was at least honest enough to say you can take the blue pill (pain pill) instead of red pill (expensive cure) . No Thanks Gav.
182 2018-08-29 23:37:33 I have a question. Why do I cough so much with heavy hitters but I don't at all with brassKnuckels oil cartridges?
183 2018-08-29 23:37:33 Is he a ‘snake oil’ salesman like trump?

185 2018-08-29 23:36:42 Hum, I thought hurricanes reduced demand for crude oil so the price would go down - no?
186 2018-08-29 23:36:28 Our continued inclination to Britain is the reason we are stagnant in development and progress as a nation. Britain prefer having a leader that promotes and protects their oil business affairs  in Nigeria than having one that wants it restructured and positioned  for greatness
187 2018-08-29 23:36:19 What does that have to do with US oil?!
188 2018-08-29 23:36:07 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .

190 2018-08-29 23:35:58 LOL that might have something to do with it. My mom swears up and down mine started going away when I was taking a salmon oil supplement for my brain.

193 2018-08-29 23:35:28 Smh I need a oil change I don’t trust nobody with my car but my dealership .  Why didn’t I take care of that while I was home 
194 2018-08-29 23:35:18 My stepdad just texted me I need to get my oil changed like the ac isn’t broke & my check engine light hasn’t been on for months lol I got bigger problems
195 2018-08-29 23:34:41 For quite some time, I thought that Hatch was the most unctuous person in the Senate. Then we got the oil company senators and the tea party assholes.
196 2018-08-29 23:34:33 I think I'd rather stay on the public side rather than be fighting amongst kitchen knives, chip fryers full of boiling oil & all the rest!
197 2018-08-29 23:34:30 Do your WODs and consume 1ounce of fish oil daily.  Sounds odd, but it works wonders. The fish oil makes a huge difference.
198 2018-08-29 23:34:26 He gives great breaks of regs for big companies,  big oil and coal.  Tax cuts were great. Actions for the least: break up unions, gut the ACA, cut programs like meals on wheels...where is the big bonus for blue collar? Arresting immigrants?

200 2018-08-29 23:34:21 @WebMD And by the way there’s a company in Ireland been making CBD oil for over 100 years so yes I guess it is kind a regulated there if you know what you’re looking for
201 2018-08-29 23:34:06 "Olive oil??"
202 2018-08-29 23:33:58 @WebMD CBD oil along with regular marijuana has really no ill side effects that I’ve ever experienced. Never heard of an overdose of marijuana. I use CBD oil at Night to replace opioids,and it helps all sorts of aches and pains. Sometimes people really do know what’s best.
203 2018-08-29 23:33:55 Which industry does Justin Trudeau prefer. I think we all know the answer to that one!
Oil industry - based in Alberta
Auto industry - based in Ontario
Dairy industry - mostly based in Quebec

Where are the big backers for the wild horses ? Aren't there any celebrities that can help out with this ? Can they get a good judge ? 
what about the majority of people against this Round up ?
208 2018-08-29 23:32:39 Your initial statement was that Canada cannot do without US oil. That is wrong and what I disputed.
209 2018-08-29 23:32:21 Temple party scene is missing house parties for sure....that’s the oil that makes the Temple engine run.. never forget that

212 2018-08-29 23:31:49 She may have created a company for tax purposes to handle her financial affairs. That does not mean she's Standard Oil.
213 2018-08-29 23:31:34 So let it wane. Go cheer for a different team then and stop whining. No one cares. Haha.  I’ll cheer the Oil through all of the turmoil, bad seasons, ups, downs and everything in between.. just like any relationship. No one is holding you hostage to cheer for a team.
214 2018-08-29 23:31:21 PIGB will do a lot of Good to Our Oil Sector

217 2018-08-29 23:31:07 Yes Papua is being exploited for its minerals, timber & palm oil. It’s high profile. The resistance strong. There are others. Who knows about the Akit, Sakai, Petalangan, Bonai, Kuala, Talang Mamak? These are just some nations within 100-200 kms of where I’m now sitting.

229 2018-08-29 23:29:42 That should have been done since the 80s oil boom if we keepin it a hunnid. But do it does go yes. I just wanna look towards the future
230 2018-08-29 23:29:35 @Sel_Watts I used the new "Peace and Quiet" oil and it worked

232 2018-08-29 23:29:12 That's what they tell you...but it's only half the truth to purposely mislead you in conversations like this.

Without farmers we don't have an independent country, period.
Without industry... energy, oil, gas, coal, iron ore, forestry....we don't have an independent country.
233 2018-08-29 23:29:10 My wife has me taking Hemp Oil with her. I have to tell you folks that I could tell a difference immediately. For instance, I now have this disgusting oily taste in my mouth all the time. It’s amazing
234 2018-08-29 23:29:01 There are forces that support hot spots in the world. Most likely, the countries-exporters of oil. Russia is one among them. Iran probable as well. Cinic policy burning lives of living people.

241 2018-08-29 23:28:15 Ok I think I need to just accept that no amount of coconut oil leave in conditioner can now save the worst most dry tumbleweed ends which be my hair. 
I think I need it cut.
242 2018-08-29 23:28:10 Why?
243 2018-08-29 23:28:03 That’s laughable. Keep telling yourselves that...we will be telling the truth about the true cost of carbon. Ignoring organic farmers on the Western slope and ignoring school boards wanting setbacks has made this initiative possible. Oil and Gas has no one to blame but themselves

246 2018-08-29 23:27:54 @elonmusk @Tesla Your selling the idea of "solar powered super chargers" to public is just like selling snake oil in my opinion. You cannot harvest from sunlight more than what it contains. Even if you were harvesting 100 percent, you will need 70 solar panels to charge one car/h

280 2018-08-29 23:22:56 here's the thing... Canada sells 97% of their oil to the USA at ~$25-30 below market value...about 3.7 billion barrels a year... that's a lot of imbalance and Justin can't count that high ... it also destroys his Enviro/Eco Friendly stance and voter base
281 2018-08-29 23:22:25 Good points raised. China is island hopping toward Australia, Every chance that Antarctic fishing and oil exploration is their goal. Where are the nuclear submarines Australia really needs to thwart such ambitions.?
282 2018-08-29 23:22:21 Only the golden oil for the world's most powerful dong. Have you insured it through Lloyd's of London yet?
283 2018-08-29 23:22:16 I just nearly chocked from laughing so hard at @Jenna_Marbles video of her admitting defeat while rubbing her DIY at home lash extensions off with coconut oil.  best thing I have seen on the internet in a while, what a gem 
284 2018-08-29 23:22:14 The PBS @newshour is engaging in a MASSIVE propaganda campaign against Venezuela to help the US government subvert its economy and promote elitist collaborators to overthrow the Venezuelan government to get at THEIR oil reserves. #SHAMEFUL and #DISGUSTING
285 2018-08-29 23:22:04 @JoyTaylorTalks listen to @ColinCowherd and try Olive Oil cake! My old restaurant serves it and it is effing AMAZING! Sweeter than you’d think without icing 
286 2018-08-29 23:21:56 Drill baby  drill! God made it and called it good so we’re using it. American Jobs! New tech means new ways of getting oil and new types of fuel. Oil is the wonder product of the past, present, and the future.
287 2018-08-29 23:21:56 Okay team, we’re really fighting for sleep tonight - I’ve got drops of lavender oil on my pillowcase and some amethyst tucked underneath it. I’m about to hit that guided sleep vid again goodnight for now, twitter 
288 2018-08-29 23:21:55 Hey bro I had stage 3b Colon cancer had my colon removed and I beat that even with the high chance of it coming back In  4 years. Never give up brother. Bible says hv the elders of the church  lay hands on u and annoy you with oil. God healed me we will heal u too. God bless P.
289 2018-08-29 23:21:36 So no, Canada does not need oil from the US.
290 2018-08-29 23:21:32 Husband has oil for the ceiling fan downstairs where it’s 90 degrees, but procrastinating about getting it in so can’t use it. Nice AC in master bedroom where I am now w/cats. I have 2 nice fans also. Otherwise I’d have to go to a hotel. Wanna come? 
291 2018-08-29 23:20:59 Before getting into these conversations you have to do some reading, learning. Canada has the 3rd largest oil reserves after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. You might have heard about Alberta’s oil sands and the oil pipeline controversy bringing oil FROM Canada to the US.
292 2018-08-29 23:20:48 Nothing like your dogs trying to steal the CBD oil drops from each other's mouths...I really wish I just had this on video.  #HempWorxForTheWin #HempWorxForDogs #HempFTW #CBDoil #GoodStuffMaynard! #YesIRepIt and #YesITakeItToo just not the dog formula obviously.
293 2018-08-29 23:20:43 Is the oil filter tight?
294 2018-08-29 23:20:35 Get vaccinated. Doctors don’t make money off vaccines, but the charlatans pushing nonsense like “keep your body more alkaline” sure as hell get rich selling snake oil.
295 2018-08-29 23:20:26 Try CBD oil.
296 2018-08-29 23:20:23 Why is the Fox agenda for the United States to stay addicted to foreign oil?
297 2018-08-29 23:20:20 Lol what's Waspapping business here?
298 2018-08-29 23:20:17 Covered in rashes, Justin Amash calmly tells Ben Carson that transgender people are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Charles Krauthammer collects dust.
299 2018-08-29 23:20:13 I wish I loved anything the way Trader Joe’s loves infusing shit with Tea Tree Oil.
300 2018-08-29 23:19:49 and it’s just stuck same chelskie when the Russian ploughed his oil in there fan base grew with glory hunters
301 2018-08-29 23:19:47 Strict carnivore diet or are you enjoying a bit of yummy butter & oil?
302 2018-08-29 23:19:46 I get my oil changed at the valvoline by my house every few months, thank you for doing this
303 2018-08-29 23:19:46 @Valvoline you best believe my next oil change will be with your brand. Well done...
304 2018-08-29 23:19:41 I agree, conventional drills should be allowed. Otherwise the Government will go all out on shale gas and oil. 
305 2018-08-29 23:19:19 oh!イル
306 2018-08-29 23:19:14 How is corn oil an Old Tradition? Oldways??

308 2018-08-29 23:18:35 Their majesty in purple cap sheathed in motor oil slid into their sweet jellyboxes
309 2018-08-29 23:18:34 Nothing says stupid like oceanic oil spills
310 2018-08-29 23:18:22 Look into wheat grass juice & RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) or a true CBD oil (they’re not all equal or even potent) and best wishes!!
311 2018-08-29 23:18:22 Comfort and growth are like oil and water they do not go together
312 2018-08-29 23:18:15 Cruz leading Beto among degenerates, oil tycoons & lizard people
313 2018-08-29 23:18:14 Jojoba oil is elite
314 2018-08-29 23:18:12 Ilang buwan na rin na hindi ako nakahawak ng oil pastel
315 2018-08-29 23:18:12 Trinidad and Tobago does not get the same prices that the us oil price per barrel is pegged at so why should we pay market prices if  gas and or fuel is  imported from somewhere else
316 2018-08-29 23:17:41 Congrats to all. Why so many fellows who don’t live in the Gulf? Their businesses and livelihoods were not directly disrupted by @BP_plc oil spill. The gulf is underrepresented here.
317 2018-08-29 23:17:31 You can do anything as long as you have infused butter or oil
318 2018-08-29 23:17:30 I wanna shower but I'm about to cook with oil 
319 2018-08-29 23:17:24 “In Descartes time, animals were considered mere machines—a crying dog was considered no different than a gear whining for want of oil.”

Is that true @psaffo? So interesting and hard to conceive if so, but believable. @edge
320 2018-08-29 23:17:24 After all these years the leaders of TNT have failed to DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY!

Depending on oil and natural gas has always been 1 of our many flaws which has consequently disadvantaged thousands today

We have not grasped the concept of sustainable development yet. What a shame
321 2018-08-29 23:17:15 Went to get an oil change, and it turns out i'm not due for one yet. They said they'll check the fluids for me, but then I'm free to go, free of charge.
322 2018-08-29 23:17:04 We brought our car into Trudeau Automotive for brakes and an oil pan leak.  We are very happy with the results and will bring all of our cars to Trudeau for service.
323 2018-08-29 23:16:36 Great news!
324 2018-08-29 23:16:28 แบ็คก็พอไม่ต้องแบล็ค

329 2018-08-29 23:15:48 We have the soft wood you need. We have the water you need. We have to oil you want. @realDonaldTrump  and his bs mind just realized that this is more economic than getting it somewhere else. We didn’t come to him... Dummass.... he came back to #NAFTA
330 2018-08-29 23:15:37 The Argentinians don’t show much interest in the people. Just the strategic value and the oil.
331 2018-08-29 23:15:23 I am convinced he tried to make butter and oil for friends to use in their brownies, but never actually had them himself.
332 2018-08-29 23:15:07 He bout to be bussin is ass off that oil lol
333 2018-08-29 23:14:53 . You can get the information the way you got your no oil export/import info. Outside US, we have new matkets for our oil
334 2018-08-29 23:14:51 why is cannabis oil legal in georgia but cultivation is illegal & its illegal to bring cannabis oil across state lines 
335 2018-08-29 23:14:47 Some food things: 1. Gourmandines, scrubbed, cubed, lightly tossed in garlic-infused EVOO and rosemary oil and slow-roasted, are AMAZING. 2. Hand-squeezed, sweet-sour OJ from oranges one has scrumped from a friend's tree is ALSO amazing.
336 2018-08-29 23:14:43 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf 
337 2018-08-29 23:14:31 If you watch that documentary ev1 the talk about the better battery that was invented and then the oil companies bought it and scrapped it so it can never be used if that's true bill you need to do something about it
338 2018-08-29 23:14:20 Here we go. Netspend blame oil money for trophy failure. As I said despite currently better than Arsenal you still  have nothing to show for it. League positions other than first aren't registered as honours in the record books.

340 2018-08-29 23:13:58 I have tried 3 different boxes. The tea tree oil ones are the best. And you just have to choose which one that would suit better for your skin. Each one details what it is good for. The one with witch hazel does better for my skin
341 2018-08-29 23:13:53 Where is the link to your Amazon wishlist again? Christmas is around the corner! I'm not saying you're getting athletic tape and baby oil...
342 2018-08-29 23:13:13 My therapist said take L-theanine, GABA, and cod fish oil, and spent 20 minutes outside and 20 minutes of increased heart rate per day. Also apparently probiotic supplements and foods help?

345 2018-08-29 23:12:29 Saudi Arabia also can't do shit lmao. They can't even control their own country. Just look at the shit hole it has become. Also all that debt was from oil we no longer buy a lot of oil from them
346 2018-08-29 23:12:11 Nope,im not shooting any shots please. Im a target. Thanks.
347 2018-08-29 23:12:09 Keep in mind that those Oil Field were there before they built those houses around the oilfield. This particular field that is pictured started drilling in 1924.

- put on deodorant 
- put on lotion or body oil 
- always wear clean clothes
351 2018-08-29 23:11:16 Well DC is an awesome account.. And there was one crow who kept coming around work eating cigarette butts and splashing in oil puddles in the parking lot. So i got birdseed and put piles outside. And now there's 6-10 fuckin crows every day just strutting around outside
352 2018-08-29 23:10:59 My thermometer is a jar of coconut oil. It's definitely clear.

355 2018-08-29 23:10:41 The first one and just put extra virgin olive oil on scalp .For the possible tension the braids might do sometimes . To give elasticity and ease any pain that braids might bring to your scalp.
356 2018-08-29 23:10:39 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
357 2018-08-29 23:10:35 Actually it’s the insane and tyrannical actions of Iran that may make oil and gas prices higher because they require sanctions. Would you prefer that we send them pallets of taxpayer cash?

362 2018-08-29 23:09:59 Strong oil prices and a solid overnight Wall Street performance could prove bullish catalysts for the AUS200 today. The AUS200 index marked an impressive run yesterday notching up a 0.75% gain.

Would you rather win the league at some point in the next 5 years with Mauricio Pochettino
Or

371 2018-08-29 23:08:25 Tax reform for the 99%, no more cattle/farm welfare, reverse all passed to harm our air, food and wildlife that has been done the last two years and protect land/waterways from big oil. Do we need to get Bernie?
372 2018-08-29 23:08:22 Depends on who you ask. Those who live there would rather stay with us. I’m inclined to agree with them. They only want them back for their use as a military base. And the oil.
373 2018-08-29 23:08:22 My car is officially ready for New York. Washed, vacuumed, & oil changed (thanks to @chrisdboyd). I’m so excited!
374 2018-08-29 23:08:19 This is a lie.  
Try telling this "story" with nothing but facts that can be authenticated. 
Go back to discussing gay frogs with the lunatic who sells snake oil to his followers
375 2018-08-29 23:08:09 Last time I checked, oil is bad for #climatechange #justsaying
376 2018-08-29 23:08:03 Usually in the same vein as running out of oil. This time, this is the year.

Or is that Linux on the desktop?
377 2018-08-29 23:08:01 The petroleum giant, Exxon, knew the devastating effects of oil on the environment. Monsanto, likewise, knew it's product was deadly. 
Capitalism and greed are destroying our planet and our government.

383 2018-08-29 23:06:57 No oil in Puerto Rico
384 2018-08-29 23:06:54 Right-wing pro oil-lobby.
The last refinery built in Alberta was 1 built to supply diesel to supply the tar sands.  Before that it was the last one was in the 1980s. If we want jobs and to not be dependent on foreign gasoline then we need refineries and preferably near the oil.
385 2018-08-29 23:06:36 Our car is fixed! The battery was replaced with a guarantee and the oil was also changed. So thankful for Joe’s momma and Leandro’s nephew for taking it to his shop 
386 2018-08-29 23:06:34 I am convinced that lavender oil fixes all my problems
387 2018-08-29 23:06:26 Any man who needed you to explain that doesn't know how to change their own oil.

389 2018-08-29 23:06:08 Thing with the new cannabis co’s is they read like the old scams- ‘we grow, me make CBD oil, best buds, international expansion’ but these are no scams- ppl want back what they told they would get all these years.

391 2018-08-29 23:05:32 @TD_BDelinski does it concern you that your police chief is claiming people are overdosing all over the United States on Weed oil? This is not only egregiously false - it’s dangerously misinformation. This is complete craziness. There is no data or science to back up that claim

398 2018-08-29 23:04:49 They need to do an episode of one of those baking shows where the contestants challenge is getting the KitchenAid mixing bowl out of the stand because they forgot to oil the base before using it. Just spent 30 mins wrestling w/mine & hitting it w/a plastic spoon to get it out.
399 2018-08-29 23:04:39 Oregano oil is supposed to be good. I need to look into something myself cuz it's such a drag to get one lol.

421 2018-08-29 23:01:12 Hey there my brother from another mother!  You could reduce rail emissions by putting pipelines east and west to displace conflict oil, grow the economy and take a record 200,000 bpd off the tracks.

430 2018-08-29 23:00:32 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

437 2018-08-29 22:59:48 It simply isn’t this hard to sell oil! If the Saudis can do it under a repressive Islamic theocracy, we can do it better.
438 2018-08-29 22:59:47 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Botticelli - Madonna with the Book | Art Reproduction Oil Painting" à l'adresse
439 2018-08-29 22:59:43 And tRUmp and Zinke are opening the most remote and beautiful parts to BIG oil drilling. tRUmp has never been there. Zinke doesn't care.

444 2018-08-29 22:58:39 Submit you plan and let’s see the actual details. don’t quote UofC study again that the author said was incorrect?  Has there been an independent study on your analysis?  You cannot count 1.5B  carbon capture when you turn around and sell it to oil and gas that gets released

449 2018-08-29 22:57:59 Don’t even start with the olive oil.

his new line of frozen vegetables is pre-cut and specially prepared for roasting. Just add oil, salt and pepper (or your favorite seasoning) and pop ‘em in the oven. In only 20 minute.
455 2018-08-29 22:56:51 Any new updates on Robert since Saturday? Really curious how he is doing.
456 2018-08-29 22:56:50 tired of getting oil changes and buying gas. like wtf
457 2018-08-29 22:56:46 Could it be the oil they fry them in?
458 2018-08-29 22:56:35 Remember when Clement Attlee created a blockade around Iran in response to their democratically elected leader nationalising their oil supply leading to tens of thousands starving to death?

Being part of your party's "moderate, mainstream tradition" is morally abhorrent.

460 2018-08-29 22:56:23 I guess ur saying Florida wants a west coast full of algae and red tide. Both coasts full of oil drilling, guns galore & developers going wild. I don't think so Trump.
461 2018-08-29 22:56:11 I haven’t laughed at a tweet like I did this one in a while.
462 2018-08-29 22:56:07 I like to think whoever put body oil in the ketchup bottle just has really exotic taste in hamburgers
463 2018-08-29 22:55:54 I respect your dedication. My parents have some sort of anti squirrel pepper oil for their birdseed and just getting a little back spray in the face from washing the mixing bowl messed me up for a while.
464 2018-08-29 22:55:50 okay so i know herbal supplements are kinda woo-woo & work differently for different people but i started taking oregano oil like 8 months ago & i haven’t gotten sick ONCE (minus hangovers). as someone who has had colds year round since middle school i’m declaring this a miracle.

466 2018-08-29 22:55:23 COMING UP ON CVM LIVE @ 7:30PM:

-   BOJ says its outlook for inflation for the temainder of 2018 and the first part of 2019 is largely predicated on an expected increase in agricultural prices and oil prices remaining elevated and higher domestic GDP growth
467 2018-08-29 22:55:16 UPDATE: we’ll return to action September 29-30 at Lucas Oil Reaceway in Indianapolis and finish out the season at Winchester Speedway in October.
468 2018-08-29 22:55:14 I think the Trump administration would agree with you. The WOW (Wheat, Oil, Water) would ideally flow northward to KRG and Turkey zone/market rather than westward to Assad.
469 2018-08-29 22:55:12 So it’s almost 4:00 p.m.  and It’s almost drunk tweet time. 
I’m almost there.
470 2018-08-29 22:55:04 The Oil will eventually run out and then your artificial cities will sink back into the desert sands. Inshallah.
471 2018-08-29 22:55:03 The last in-depth report I read was John Swinneys’ and it was predicated on oil at over $100 per barrel.
I get the grandstanding on both the Yes & No “campaigns” is headling grabbing, but I would much prefer clear coherent policies being presented.
It’s all too shouty just now!
472 2018-08-29 22:54:58 That you are shocked is shocking. Nigeria for years is 6th Producer of Petroleum globally. It's greedy leadership that plagues the country. Aside from Oil, so many natural resources and a vibrant workforce. Research,not just bliv -ve Press.
473 2018-08-29 22:54:53 Because it was definitely the former petro state attorney general who spent his career protecting oil companies and then got tapped to head the EPA, where he promptly got to work dismantling climate regulations and personally polluting as much as possible w/ private flights
474 2018-08-29 22:54:44 Did they create SARS for Yahoo boys? Or you dont even know the meaning of the name? SPECIAL ANTI ROBBERY SQUAD. Are Yahoo armed robbers?
475 2018-08-29 22:54:22 No one else is in the running to kill big oil. An essential part of saving the planet.
476 2018-08-29 22:54:18 It feels a little like the Summer of '73. But that took another year to shake out (there was an intervening oil shock and a recession, too). DO WE HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME?!?
477 2018-08-29 22:53:35 Outlawed discrimination by insurance companies towards those with pre-existing conditions

Made BP pay $50B to clean up the Gulf Coast to compensate Americans after the oil spill

Comforted the country in times of national disaster. 

Always took the side of our intelligence.
478 2018-08-29 22:53:25 My Grandparents left on vacation this morning and I already called them and asked them to come back because I need my Grandpa to put sweet oil in my ear like he does all the time when I have an earache. What am I gonna do when they are actually gone & don’t live right next door
479 2018-08-29 22:53:23 i bet the guys that do my oil changes hate me

482 2018-08-29 22:53:11 We're unprepared to deal with record-breaking temps, resultant sea level rise from glaciers melting, & changes in sea temps that lead to greater intensity hurricanes. And look at the air quality levels we have with oil & gas. 

When we have free, clean, sun & wind to harness.

3. Why did Jake the snake get DepGov instead of Smiles?

497 2018-08-29 22:50:32 How so ? The Arabs don’t own the most oil, have the largest military or own the most money, the Europeans do. Esau has the fatness of the earth. The Arabs don’t have the most of anything anymore.
498 2018-08-29 22:50:32 Stop lying about a carbon tax being ineffective.  Let’s have industry dictate? Is that the oil and gas industry you get donations from?  If you actually implemented a system there would be no tax. Take credit for farmers while the govt does nothing new. Incompetent! #dobetter

503 2018-08-29 22:49:31 Brewers pulling out of buck a beer, Tesla wins court injunctions over green energy, carbon tax being eliminated from natural gas, the cheapest fuel used primarily in cities where the greatest population resides while no hint of the reduction for propane or expensive furnace oil
504 2018-08-29 22:49:24 Quietly, except for that 1 “minor” 210,000 gallons of oil leaked near Amherst, South Dakota. The “facts” are that it has leaked and will leak again because oil pipelines leak.
505 2018-08-29 22:49:14 I had to have a nurse come to visit & he asked for a list of my meds. I told him not to forget my high thc & high cbd oil. "Nah that's not important!" "What!?"

"You mean this is prescription medication?"

"YES! Please write it down!"

506 2018-08-29 22:49:12 I will testify again that ants hate mint. I made spray with water, dish soap & mint extract (oil would probably work better) that solved my ant problem almost immediately. You can also soak cotton balls in mint for problem spots.

516 2018-08-29 22:48:00 Yet his two biggest #fundingsecured "investors" were:
1. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, which pumped 10.03 million barrels a day in May. 
2. The company which "dieselgate" and "emissionsgate" are named after. 

This is either irony or maybe it's death by water.

526 2018-08-29 22:46:10 --The chicken cubes in small batches, set aside, and let the oil boil off the extra moisture from the chicken. Then dropped it all in again for some more crisping, about 3-5 minutes. 

After that, saute the white parts of chopped green onion, along with garlic/ginger

Off of the top of your head, how many our refineries refine foreign oil and how many BPD in total?
538 2018-08-29 22:44:49 You mean like the electricians, pipe fitters, boilermakers, instrumentation people that are all unionized that work in oil and gas?

556 2018-08-29 22:42:06 This is why we will lose the fight against climate change: supposed Earth defenders @EnvDefenseFund call Gov Brown, under whom 20,000 oil permits have been approved, and may now offset CA's emissions with dodgy REDD projects, a "climate hero"
557 2018-08-29 22:42:03 Would there be enough when it’s only oil and gas that Nigeria use in making money
558 2018-08-29 22:41:55 They said I’d be stiff from riding. They were right. Glad I’ve still got some of the Neal’s Yard oil @DuchessOChutney gave me when I ran the Marathon...
559 2018-08-29 22:41:42 This is why we will lose the fight against climate change: supposed Earth defenders @EnvDefenseFund call Gov Brown, under whom 20,000 oil permits have been approved, and may now offset CA's emissions with dodgy REDD projects, a "climate hero"
560 2018-08-29 22:41:24 WE'RE NOT PUTTING OIL IN YOUR FUEL SYSTEM, SIR
561 2018-08-29 22:41:11 I hear it's out with the oil for Alberta and we in for the green for Alberta now! Now Alberta is going to be known for its great great green! Just ask @CamBattley! So exciting!!!
562 2018-08-29 22:41:07 @murraycathal... I hope some Cocteau Twins are on the way  ... how about some 'Heaven or Las Vegas'... it'll keep the midnight oil lit here in Evanston, Illinois!

564 2018-08-29 22:41:05 I cannot take any recipe seriously that has fewer than 4 cloves of garlic or if contains any of the following: Chili powder, ketchup, liquid smoke, or truffle oil.
565 2018-08-29 22:41:02 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
566 2018-08-29 22:41:01 Remember when coconut oil was amazing for you like 20 minutes ago...now it’s “poison.” 

Just leave cheese alone!

                    
567 2018-08-29 22:40:43 @JoeyRyanOnline When rubbing in baby oil .... What method is better? Clockwise or Counterclockwise? .... OR does Mr. Miyagi play a role using the wax on wax off method?

569 2018-08-29 22:40:37 The French minister of ecological transition, Nicolas Hulot, said by resigning "I do not believe anymore". In Canada, Justin Trudeau wants to further exploit the oil sands. Trumps USA, without comment.I believe that the UN should make global warming ITS priority.
570 2018-08-29 22:40:31 I think you rock them & look super cutie! Use castor oil on em to help em grow faster!
571 2018-08-29 22:40:18 Num 11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. #Steele
572 2018-08-29 22:40:11 This would be perfect

574 2018-08-29 22:40:05 What about those where natural gas is not available? Why not reduce on all forms of heating? I have no choice but to use propane or oil.
575 2018-08-29 22:40:04 I use olive oil... My mom thinks she is being "healthy" when she makes it too but I keep telling her that THAT much butter is undoing anything healthy she thinks she is getting out of them... THO, I guess butter covered Kale is better than butter covered STEAK & POTATOES! LOL!

577 2018-08-29 22:39:33 Crap . I have to get my oil changed! Thanks for answering Dion! 
578 2018-08-29 22:39:27 How come people are anti oil and gas until Venezuela can't sell enough-then the solution to socialism is to open the taps and sell loads of oil.
579 2018-08-29 22:39:20 @Colby_Daniels I like the pistols firing blog nickname for Taylor C. Best: “The Oil Baron” (bc the Cornelius is a bit waspY) lol

Oil on canvases
581 2018-08-29 22:39:02 I mixed aloe, honey and coconut oil as a treatment for my hair and as stink as aloe is, honey smells worse to me.
582 2018-08-29 22:38:46 So misleading. Anybody on a Mediterranean style diet is just going to be more fit overall. Olive oil would just be a natural part of that.
583 2018-08-29 22:38:26 white people smell like motor oil and hot dog water
584 2018-08-29 22:38:20 You can also use a lil tea tree oil to wash with and wipe the area as well helps
585 2018-08-29 22:38:03 After you use the clove oil, chai tea will be your best friend cause the taste goes together. When I got dry socket I lived on chai tea for like a month
586 2018-08-29 22:37:48 I’m assuming you’re tweeting this on an iPhone, wearing a synthetic fabric and/or makeup....which you have because the oil and gas industry has made it possible to produce petroleum based products
587 2018-08-29 22:37:29 しんどいから公式ではやらなくていいです()
588 2018-08-29 22:37:27 Kind of like Iraq...oh wait the oil was supposed to build up that country after our AWSOME misguided stupid war, that left a vacuum for terrorist to move in.
589 2018-08-29 22:37:15 Here's hoping he forced you to make it a 3 car team full-time when Robbie comes back!  Good luck @CarlosMunoz034 I'm sure you'll love it with @SPMIndyCar ... may have to make you an honourary canuck.
590 2018-08-29 22:37:15 What do you think was there first? Wells are all over LA because that's where the oil is. Maybe stop going to Starbucks if you want to save the world.

596 2018-08-29 22:36:33 Before anyone goes accusing socialism of causing this please look up what happens when a country uses a boom-and-bust oil economy
597 2018-08-29 22:36:32 early labor is draining the absolute life out of me. all i’ve done is sleep. i’m miserable and i just want to cry. nothing i do is working; i’ve been on the yoga ball, tried the castor oil, went for bumpy car rides, went for walks, tried sex, tried pineapple. NOTHING is helping.
598 2018-08-29 22:36:28 I know this was 4 days ago, but I’ve been doing some research and haven’t found an answer to whether or not you can mix dry and wet oils together to make your own oil blend? Will it mess up the whole chemistry of them or ??
599 2018-08-29 22:36:03 Up burning the midnight oil
600 2018-08-29 22:35:47 I agree with @rohangrey in his replies here and @StephanieKelton original tweet. Questions - do non-US countries selling oil have to sell in US$? Do these countries use their US$ for SWF? What does #MMT suggest these countries do with their US$ oil gains?
601 2018-08-29 22:35:41 Thank God for people like you and your staff Tom..I’m all petered out just from watching, listening, and reading about this corruption, that I’m getting to the point where I just don’t give a damn whether they get prosecuted or not.  The squeaky wheel is not getting any oil.
602 2018-08-29 22:35:26 2. Use coconut oil!
Your eyebrows are made up of proteins. Coconut oil reduces protein loss and makes your brows stronger!
603 2018-08-29 22:35:11 Ladies you know that feeling of dread when you go to an oil change because you know they will try to take advantage of you because you have tits? Yeah.... it's awesome.
604 2018-08-29 22:35:08 The syllabus for my art history class at my Christian college says that we have to create a work of art at the end and I'm seriously thinking of doing an oil painting of the sistine chapel still in the God is a woman music video or Ariana's version of the last supper for MTV
605 2018-08-29 22:35:04 If your cooking it on bbq....once your done,drop some oil or fat on the plates below grill to get a flame going-nice finish!!

608 2018-08-29 22:34:53 Gracias. Muy relativo con el verde. ADR debería ir paso a paso. Por los 37/38, ya sería muy bueno. 40 es MUY fuerte resistencia: eso ya sería gloria. La plaza en Milan, bien, pero tranqui. Ahí los 17 Eur serían el paraíso. OIL, clave

612 2018-08-29 22:34:32 Soil Not Oil author Dr. Vandana Shiva says we can fix the carbon imbalance in one year if everyone grows an organic garden. That carbon sequestration is desperately needed.
613 2018-08-29 22:34:26 @Cartier The crystal in my tank watch shattered. Cartier said they would replace it for about $700. No way. I took it to a local jeweler who replaced the crystal for $50. Cartier was going to oil, clean, blah, blah, blah. They were up selling like crazy.
614 2018-08-29 22:34:20 They are all blind. Trump is into real estate. he had to turn over his business. yet the Bush's oil deals?. @IvankaTrump gave up her line because she would prosper. Whats the Obamas NW today?Trump brought Iran to its knees without our taxes. He puts the USA1st. #WalkAway
615 2018-08-29 22:34:04 Face oils are a game changer. Even if u have oily skin. It balances things out, I even discovered that my skin stops breaking out when I use grape seed or pomegranate oil every night. So many other good oils Bas these two are magic. I also recommend rose oil for face,body,lips
616 2018-08-29 22:33:56 I love it boiled and topped with some soy sauce, ginger garlic scallions and sesame oil /seeds 
617 2018-08-29 22:33:52 Why do most girls out here dress like oil field moms. You’re almost 18, not 34 with 2 kids.
618 2018-08-29 22:33:50 Great piece, but they are not “waiting” a few months for higher oil prices as you & the professor said. Few analysts expect prices to rise much in near future. And VZ has so destroyed its production capacity that it couldn’t recover the industry w/o foreign help.
619 2018-08-29 22:33:49 @IamKevinCostner Kevin, just to ask you if your oil seperation machines can help us in SW Florida with algae problems. Naples, bonita, FT Meyers, Lake Okachobee. Thk you.
620 2018-08-29 22:33:41 Yeeeeah, it's fucking ridiculous. I was told to take talcum powder and baby oil and all kinds of shit. Just clothes for two (before and after), sanitary towels and yourself is fine xD
621 2018-08-29 22:33:21 1. Use castor oil!
Castor oil is one of the most effective remedies for getting thicker eyebrows. It promotes hair growth and also ensures that every hair strand is thick and strong 
622 2018-08-29 22:33:20 Absolutely shocked by the devastation caused by palm oil farming & mining in Borneo. For a country to lose 50% of its forests to benefit humans but at the expense of animals is just obscene. Please don’t buy palm oil or any derivatives #OrangutanJungleSchool
623 2018-08-29 22:33:06 yawll im covered in coca butter and almond oil is in my hair for the night god bless us x
624 2018-08-29 22:32:58 Ways boy I didn't realize everybody was so well informed on the inner workings of the oil industry. Y'all must have seen this shutdown coming for months!
625 2018-08-29 22:32:38 do I have any friends on here who have tried using cbd oil to help with anxiety? if so, what are your thoughts on it? feel free to dm me please
626 2018-08-29 22:32:37 Smelling oil since centuries is really good trade. Rest of the world call it win-lose game. Guess what Brits have been winning all the time. How about that?
627 2018-08-29 22:32:16 Experimenting with a couple of new hair oils tonight, one for repair, the other to encourage growth. If you've got course hair, oil is fabulous.

632 2018-08-29 22:31:52 Mn el rose water. Don’t let he face fully dry after the rose+aloe mix. This will get locked up in ur skin, this is actually how u really hydrate and benefit from ur moisturizers. Then I let the serum dry, apply cream, let it dry then a face oil (usually only at night)
633 2018-08-29 22:31:45 It's the inside. Primarily a cornstarch and veggie oil layer. Pan is stainless steel and it's my favorite :( I have it soaking in a baking soda paste now.

640 2018-08-29 22:31:16 So I went to the pharmacy in town to get CBD oil and when I was checking out the guy said: ”do you mind me asking what you use this for?”  why did he ask? Like I’m not mad but I’m hella emotional and almost started crying tbh
641 2018-08-29 22:31:13 @chrissyteigen help an old girl out and use your pull - For the love of GLOW - Dont discontinue this line, especially the body oil!  In fact, I beg you to expand it to include a proper fragrance. It is THE summer scent!
642 2018-08-29 22:31:13 I should've bought food b4 coming for my oil change 
643 2018-08-29 22:31:09 Why should my people in Volta leave southern Volta which is richer and discovering oil and other natural resources to join a poverty stricken Ghana Region? How? - you’re a tribal brat!!
644 2018-08-29 22:31:03 @CNN  reported this. Let me translate. A small fishing vessel off the coast of Japan ran out of fuel and was rescued by an oil frigate.
645 2018-08-29 22:30:54 Harvey Weinstein was supposedly a big consumer of rapeseed oil.
646 2018-08-29 22:30:44 Yes!! I mix mine with xtra virgin olive oil and real bacon bits.

652 2018-08-29 22:30:19 Reminder: The sense of stability you, a Nigerian, think you enjoy, is an illusion. Your life—school fees, fuel price, food price, etc.—is at the mercy of the oil market. NEVER FORGET THIS.

655 2018-08-29 22:30:01 I am not mentioning the nuln oil because i think its not part of weathering but it is part of basic texturing of the stone.
656 2018-08-29 22:29:57 CBD oil is helpful. It's too bad you don't have medical marijuana there. I've been almost pain free (and completely pill free) since I started.
657 2018-08-29 22:29:57 Got sent a huge diesel from another store because they didn't have the oil. They quoted him $126 for a $230 change (15 quarts of full syn oil) so we have to honour it because they just keep claiming that's what their computer says
658 2018-08-29 22:29:56 Hey! I’m middle age and own it!! And can’t beat a $30 oil change.
659 2018-08-29 22:29:33 My theory is they don’t have a plan up their sleeve for jobs for all the miners and industries that support mining/oil gas that would disappear once renewables took hold. They don’t know how to employ those people, which is political...as always
660 2018-08-29 22:29:23 Cindy, 
News flash: This is the male version crime of Casey Anthony and Scott Peterson rolled into one giant tragic horror story. When is the last time you saw a Dad dump his dead kids in silo's of oil? Quite bashing these great peeps. #ChrisWatts Perhaps you need a #SafeSpace ?
661 2018-08-29 22:29:10 What about #scotland where you get your oil from?
662 2018-08-29 22:29:09 Coconut oil is really the truth, be having my skin glowing and hair moisturized
663 2018-08-29 22:29:08 Thankfully these were things my parents taught me, though I don’t bother changing my own oil cuz the bother of disposing the old oil.
664 2018-08-29 22:28:56 #SOME OF IT, NOT THE REAL TRUTH! IT'S  STILL HAPPENING TO THIS DAY AT STANDING ROCK, AND YOU DON'T  HEAR ABOUT THAT! MY BROTHER  WAS ALMOST BEATEN TO DEATH THERE ON THE REX, BY JUST THE OIL WORKERS N POLICE. 45 SIGNED IT INTO LAW, AND IT'S  ON HIS HANDS, NOT YET IN BOOKS!
665 2018-08-29 22:28:51 So it's legal to possess medical cannabis oil in Georgia, but you can't grow it here or bring here either... hmmmm. @RElliotWSB says state lawmakers are talking about fixing that now. @wsbtv at 6p
666 2018-08-29 22:28:41 My mom trying to be disappointed about the okra she was going to fry being bad and then having to replace them with fries because the oil was already hot...while munching on a fry...was probably one of the best things I've seen today, lol

674 2018-08-29 22:27:05 Just not up to subjecting myself to Hannitys snake oil and spin.  My anti-manipulation shield is worn out at the moment.  Would much rather hear why a supposed non partisan news source thinks anything he says is worth repeating or has any merit at all.

Silicon Vally (apple) argument only china has infrastructure belies history of US mil-industrial ramp in 1941-43. unprecedented.  So trump starts w/ auto/steel/oil
686 2018-08-29 22:24:20 I like your optimism but I think you're confusing transportations fuels with electricity. Unless electric vehicles become the norm in southeast Asia (which will take more than a few years) we will see demand for oil continue to grow.
687 2018-08-29 22:24:18 i never use heat tho! im at the pool during the week and trh on sundays but were required to wear our hair up anyway so i never do anything to it and i only wash my hair every 2 days but im gonna try coconut oil on just my roots bc mine gets super greasy too
688 2018-08-29 22:24:12 You’re a master of deflection, Jason. You know as well as I do that Shell is NOT the only major oil company that supports carbon pricing. In fact, by opposing action on climate change, you’re offside of oil sands companies  who have prioritized become ‘carbon competitive.’ #ableg
689 2018-08-29 22:24:09 Lol jk I never had any but I figured I should try it now that coconut oil is poison
690 2018-08-29 22:23:58 I have C Tango B-Hydra C Firma TLC Baby Facial Marula Oil Jelly Cleanser Juju & Pekee bar the tinted sunscreen. Now I am broke & banned from Sephora for another 6 months. At least my skin feels great
691 2018-08-29 22:23:54 Egg yolks, olive oil, one (1) banan, honey, and then I added another blend of oils that smells like roses so it doesn't smell like eggs so much anymore XD
692 2018-08-29 22:23:48 congratsss kak! aku mau lush mask, aloe bha skin tone, sama l'oreal extraordinary oil hehe #GAbyMauIndomie
693 2018-08-29 22:23:14 just put on a face mask then put a vitamain E skin moisturizing oil afterwards and I’m letting it sink in and this feeling is a different level of luxurious that I didn’t think was possible
694 2018-08-29 22:23:03 Oil Climbs as US Crude Stock Draw Exceeds Expectations #bloomberg
695 2018-08-29 22:22:45 $0 from oil and gas in my County for the past 5 years. Yes, in Colorado! So while China opens a new coal-fired power plant every week, you want to punish Americans by making their energy costs ridiculously high, while the rest of the world generates all the CO2 they want?
696 2018-08-29 22:22:30 Coconut oil is much better for you and tastes great-less filling
697 2018-08-29 22:22:29 i am head to toe in coconut oil and my skin and hair are so soft
698 2018-08-29 22:22:27 All that word salad just to say you support Regime change for OIL for Israel.
699 2018-08-29 22:22:21 Kratom has been made illegal in the UK but CBD oil has been made legal.
I'm currently using CBD in place of Tramadol. Perhaps it would also help?
700 2018-08-29 22:21:56 Don’t underestimate the powers of Jamaican black castor oil
701 2018-08-29 22:21:33 History been telling Trinidad to take it easy with the reliance on oil/gas but nah we enjoyed the ride. Downfall was written in the stars and institutions were breaking down way before Petrotrin's recent disaster.

708 2018-08-29 22:19:30 I would suggest getting one! And drink red raspberry leaf tea ! And use evening promise oil !
709 2018-08-29 22:19:30 Hat looks great and that grip looks like you had lots of “swing oil” out there 
710 2018-08-29 22:19:23 how about we stop subsidizing coal and oil?  would that be okay with you?
711 2018-08-29 22:19:21 I was totally wrong. The only thing I did right was hedge with EM miners that were already so beat up I managed to get out for profit.

I did not see Dollars massive hard on coming in March and positioned badly most of this year.

Back to oil producers now. We look good together.
712 2018-08-29 22:19:06 Yeah, especially if you rub Bio Oil on them. You know acne comes back though, but like i said, Bio Oil works wonders. Also, drink lots of water.
713 2018-08-29 22:19:04 I will now I'm home, good old olbus oil ready. Have the most vile taste and smell. Love sent take care xxxx
714 2018-08-29 22:19:01 This bitch is not prioritized  I'm drinking a gallon of water and taking baths in rose water coconut oil or some shit but I can't get more than 5 hours sleep and sometimes too lazy to wash my face at night
715 2018-08-29 22:18:59 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
716 2018-08-29 22:18:51 Huh? Tolls, sales tax, property tax, state income tax, fed income tax, phone tax, cable tax, gas tax, oil heat tax, electric tax, liquor tax, soda tax, I can go on. Please stick with reality
717 2018-08-29 22:18:38 携帯こわれました
718 2018-08-29 22:18:35 Yeah I enjoy that kinda stuff like American pickers but honestly it’s more fun banging stuff with a hammer and getting covered in oil xD
719 2018-08-29 22:18:20 Hey Original Oil Paintings thanks for the follow!

721 2018-08-29 22:18:03 Cus we need the oil. Put labels on the gas pumps. Let America choose to buy Saudi gas...or Not.
722 2018-08-29 22:17:56 Being an oil changer is cool I guess
723 2018-08-29 22:17:49 gutter press journalism at its finest, the person behind it is probably no oil painting too
724 2018-08-29 22:17:47 I started on cbd oil, and no longer need my anxiety meds, which is helping my depression immensely!!! Just my 2 cents
725 2018-08-29 22:17:40 We ran into an angel with too many wings to count, covering its body like a shell, made of oil.
726 2018-08-29 22:17:32 Not really when their oil is sold at $15.00 a barrel below world market prices.
727 2018-08-29 22:17:19 See, I understand what you’re saying. However, everybody is unique. I suffer from mental illness and I am not one who believes in violence. Some people and guns do not mix, just like oil and water. Most people are just water, but a small percentage have “oil added to their glass”
728 2018-08-29 22:17:16 Grr...  Is there any smartphone cooling pad/thermal solution that isn't just radiation blocking snake oil?  My hand is borked and I can't write - so I'm taking videos of a 1.5 hr lecture.  I'd like my phone to not overhead and record high-freq whining while taking 1080p video.
729 2018-08-29 22:17:12 Actually gone and ordered pure peppermint oil to spray around my bedroom window  to keep spiders out my bedroom and if it doesn’t work I’m going to be so fuckin sad
730 2018-08-29 22:17:05 Bro and these kids are so soft and probably cant manage to even do a simple oil change on their cars smh. I get so heated talking about this
731 2018-08-29 22:16:59 I like green people’s moisturiser and I use rose hip oil most evenings
732 2018-08-29 22:16:45 Google is too big. Break it up like Ma Bell or Standard Oil.
733 2018-08-29 22:16:41 The Europeans rule the earth right now & they covered the face of the messiah. The Saudis dont even have the most oil anymore.
734 2018-08-29 22:16:39 Use rose hip oil. Way better

744 2018-08-29 22:15:26 I did half a Udemy course, stopped for a month, came back and couldn’t remember anything. Blender familiarity and my brain are like oil and water, I’m just going to buy Maya LT next time
745 2018-08-29 22:15:21 Yeah i just use the ordinary one and then the neutrogena oil free moisturiser,the grapefruit one and I haven't had problems with blackheads since, i use the salicylic acid from the ordinary too!

754 2018-08-29 22:13:59 it's also better lubricant than olive oil
755 2018-08-29 22:13:48 job market is amazing stock market is amazing manufacturing is amazing usa gas and oil production is amazing in other words you are a fucking troll

756 2018-08-29 22:13:33 My car was almost a decade old when I bought, bought used. It's fast as hell and has had ZERO issues for YEARS. Zip. Oil change. You are really, really stretching with this.
757 2018-08-29 22:13:25 I guess this Lush foundation is most suitable for normally clear skin tones, I have the kind of skin where I can rub coconut oil after shower on damp skin if I wanted to and never breaks me out, they say coconut oil's acnegenic but not if you have clear skin

759 2018-08-29 22:13:12 It is so great. The olive oil doesn't alter the flavor of the chip, just a conduit for the heat. They are so damn good.

765 2018-08-29 22:12:49 DT predicts violence if Dems prevail. Is this a blatant scare tactic or what. If anything,  the opposite may be true. PT Barnum selling his snake oil.
766 2018-08-29 22:12:35 Oil based white makeup, such RMGP (like graftobian) or clown white, might work better for darker skin.  All the water-based paints have a degree of translucency. Alcohol based paint, you might have some luck with, but may need more than 1 pass.

769 2018-08-29 22:12:17 Specially when oil is involved, right? Then screw the environment, the liberals said. NO PIPELINE!!!!

771 2018-08-29 22:12:00 Tried the MCT Oil? Apparently the C8 (caprylic acid) is what converts to ketones the fastest, even if you’re not in a ketogenic state. Bulletproof mct is C8 only. Heard all of this in a lot smarter manner on Peter Attias podcast with Dom D’Agostino. Defeats your “diy” though

776 2018-08-29 22:11:38 nah, they're a bit like fish oil pills and are somewhat fragile. They come in an insulated bag with 3 ice packs, which I suppose is necessary since it will melt at much higher than room temp, but sheesh
777 2018-08-29 22:11:30 I had a friend that would put dried habaneros in a bottle of olive oil. Let it sit for a few days then pour it into a bag of og doritos. That's where it's at.
778 2018-08-29 22:11:25 This is super simple, my coworker taught it to me. Roast vegetables of your choice. Add broth of your choice, simmer for like a half hour, then blend it together. I then added scorpion hot sauce and iirc chile oil to mine, I forget what it's called.
779 2018-08-29 22:10:58 I was the first minister to go to Parliament in 2015 and in 2016 (election year) to revise the budget downwards when crude oil prices fell.
780 2018-08-29 22:10:54 I got two shades from Lush in their slap stick foundations, the 15W and 19W, I can switch to match for when I have a tan or not, it's a really good smelling foundation, it says it has coconut oil in there, I have skin that's normally clear so works for me
781 2018-08-29 22:10:43 Why not?. They are enjoying free oil money nah. 
782 2018-08-29 22:10:33 I once experienced it, what annoyed me most is they couldn't even use groundnuts oil, instead they pour red oil, the one that enters your inner brain.
783 2018-08-29 22:10:11 but you must be using bad cooking fat.. must probably fake olive oil, grape seed oil, canola oil.. ditch all of them. I went on RAW Cold Press Coconut oil.. healed my issues.. LDL went down HDL were higher.. To this day, I consume only RCPCO n Ghee..

787 2018-08-29 22:09:57 Seriously? Oil of Cloves and a pack of cotton buds. VERY carefully rub the clove oil onto the gum and tooth in question, be very liberal, and keep going until you feel nothing. Be over the sink as you will drool (it's not a pretty sight) and it tastes vile. But is works

793 2018-08-29 22:09:12 So you're in Ottawa and we should trust your knowledge on oil sands projects and their life cycles.  Riiight. How about you visit northern Alberta for yourself and see how beautiful it is here. I think you've looked at too many images of mining pits filled with rain water.
794 2018-08-29 22:09:10 Independence has gone, huge deficit, huge debit, out of control spending, 25 year recovery time, SNP at war with itself, failure to develop the economy, reliance on oil, reliance on U.K. subsidies, public rejection of referendum, gross SNP incompetence and lying etc...

800 2018-08-29 22:08:45 Sometimes you have to fly with the public. Don’t get mad that your private G5 is in for an oil change!
801 2018-08-29 22:08:31 Venezuela has just ordered all banks to adopt its native cryptocurrency - the Petro. It is tied to the price of oil to maintain stability, but concerns over the adoption has left many citizens to run to Dash instead.

826 2018-08-29 22:05:24 If you use Energy egg replacer, coconut oil instead of butter and use unsweetened soy milk baked goods usually turn out exactly the same. It’s just oil/fat/liquid you’re replacing you don’t need to use animal products.
827 2018-08-29 22:05:24 I wish they hurry up with changing the oil on my car I’m ready to go tf home

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
829 2018-08-29 22:05:20 Only in moderation, better to use something like olive oil or avocado oil (our favourite). They also do not contaminate the taste of the food as coconut oil sometimes does.

833 2018-08-29 22:04:28 The only way the leaders of the west can turn their backs on their own people is they must be getting a deal load of money from oil rich countries.

835 2018-08-29 22:04:15 Mariann if NAFTA goes bye bye, you guys will be in the newest 3rd word nation in less than a year.  You don't have enough timber, iron ore, coal or water and you'll have to buy your oil and natural gas for triple in US funds as opposed to in Cdn funds.
836 2018-08-29 22:04:00 For 16 years he has been preaching Jesus as a prophet but now he is going to preach Jesus as the son of God. Hallelujah
837 2018-08-29 22:03:58 Is it, or should it... same for car makers, food makers, alcohol makers,  cannabis makers, processed food makers, fast food makers, etc. etc. Big oil, Big sugar, Big pharma, and so on... blame everyone else for our inadequacies, right?
838 2018-08-29 22:03:48 You quote a single figure that is the measure most often shown to say everything is going well. You don’t mention soybean export was maximized to avoid tariffs, oil imports were down, companies bought software, housing market slumped and consumers are not spending money.
839 2018-08-29 22:03:45 Snake oil sellers like farage care nothing for the UK fishing industry; how many fisheries committee meetings did he bother to attend. Our hard working fisher folk are nothing but pawns to niggel #WeDeserveBetter #PeoplesVote #WATON #FBPE #StopBrexit

843 2018-08-29 22:03:31 Yes! #Trump doesn’t know anything, he is buffoon blah blah blah! 

So what if he is a multi-billionaire, won presidency against all odds, economy growth story to tell, trade deals going his way etc

And what is #socialism? Country with largest oil reserves in tatters - #Venezuela

Like is it dinner plans tonight? It won’t be that bad.

Car needs an oil change? No I took care of that yesterday.

The future? Don’t open that door.

853 2018-08-29 22:02:03 Mariann, a US company drilling for oil in the gulf will sell it to a US refinery for OPEC prices.  Your country has always done that, when you get it from us under Nafta you buy it for $22 Cdn a barrel and you think that's a rip-off?

856 2018-08-29 22:01:56 That's the point, his views about Jesus Christ has changed, he no longer believes Jesus is a prophet but not believes he is the son of God.
857 2018-08-29 22:01:46 Trump wants to sacrifice whales for the sake of oil profits.
858 2018-08-29 22:01:46 What is crazy? everyone has said who is behind isis from day one, it's about oil, how many attackers on 9/11 was from Iraq? 15 were saudi natives yet Aramco now sells 10 million barrels of oil a day n iraqs a training camp, it's everyone else that's behind

873 2018-08-29 22:00:01 Can't wait till they have it their way where men get to be stay at home dads and women instead have to go work in plumbing, engineering and on oil rigs etc. Sure society would be waaaay less efficient but hey life would be easy af for half of us.
874 2018-08-29 22:00:01 Would you rather invest a little more than you're paying for bills right now for 2-3 years and save thousands upon thousands of $$ over your lifetime, or be robbed and at the mercy of the utility company and oil forever?

889 2018-08-29 21:56:39 You want less cars on the road, to make them more safer (for bikes especially): Great! Fight that fight. Don’t attempt to achieve that by circulating oil industry style pseudo-science to try and claim EVs are bad for air quality. Campaign for fewer cars for safer roads.

907 2018-08-29 21:54:23 Lol I meant no shame but just didn't feel like fixing it but trust me I don't. I got over 50 candles and like a shit ton of car sprays and the little oil things so I'm pleased with myself

927 2018-08-29 21:51:43 That makes perfect sense, given the steep increase that has occurred. But what are the odds for it to repeat? I'd wager not that favourably... Crude oil cannot go up indefinitely either, there's a limit to everything...
928 2018-08-29 21:51:43 Big pharma is getting into cbd oil, which the fda just approved. The 2nd generation of the cbd oil now approved, has a higher thc level and is seeing even better results in clinical trials.

954 2018-08-29 21:48:41 Coconut Oil for everything... deodorant, cooking, oil pulling, lubrication, moisturizer, makeup cleanser, hair conditioner, sun tan lotion, etc.
955 2018-08-29 21:48:36 Anyway, Isis grows Horus some new hands because she isn't a completely degenerate mother, and then she takes some oil and a jug and makes Horus' "member become stiff", catching his seed in the jug.

1111 2018-08-29 21:27:38 Newcastle do have great fans, how can you argue against it when they’re constantly filling a stadium despite all the shit going on? They’re hindered by Ashley and that’s all it’s down to. City may as well not have existed before the oil came in, Newcastle one the other hand...
1112 2018-08-29 21:27:26 Efforts to coax a spider off the windowsill with peppermint oil just turned my clumsy world into a minty fresh hellscape.

1115 2018-08-29 21:26:43 In my old job, most of the PT employees I oversaw at the plant preferred being PT - they made way more per hr than the college level salaried employees & had more control of their hrs & vacation. Quit trying to invent problems just to sell your scam like a snake oil salesman
1116 2018-08-29 21:26:40 So why Berkshire? Haslam said he wanted to be able to tell employees that the company is "forever," that it will stay the same way. Another oil company would have  likely moved it out of Knoxville, he said.

Mix up with rice cooked in veg stock, chopped fried onion, herbs, a little oil. Put the lids on, brush/drizzle with oil, bake in a tin at about 180C until wrinkly but not singed.

Ya mean they were attempting to repel mosquitoes?

1155 2018-08-29 21:20:35 With the number of military vehicles passing my hood tonight, accompanying trucks carrying barrels of oil...

I believe oil  has more value than human life...
1156 2018-08-29 21:20:25 Yes, they DO drink the snake oil because he has promised them a Supreme Court nominee who will kill human rights, including a woman's right to choose.   It's ALL about abortion and "those damned queers".

1173 2018-08-29 21:18:23 Climate 2.0 indeed. It will need the buy-in of the oil&gas companies. 

Synfuels may not be perfect however, like big tobacco and the e-cigarette, they may allay decades of rearguard actions and get a substantial decarbonisation faster than the electrification route.

1177 2018-08-29 21:17:33 Yeah but as long as they give him a striker. He have a head of a HW.
1178 2018-08-29 21:17:22 All of which I agree with and have covered many times. I think we do get VZ right. Only point I sought to make tonight was the oil price drop in 2014 acted as a catalyst on several fronts that in part led to exodus. Want to come on the programme some time?
1179 2018-08-29 21:17:18 I guess I’m worst all the time... 3/4 of the oil I get is regulator, the other 1/4 is @SmokeyPointProd 
1180 2018-08-29 21:17:09 Had it been all Buharists have same mind like you, Buhari would have been performing better than he is doing now. The main problem we have is simply the ingrained aversion to the matters of progress and development. We take it a norm to never criticize someone we love.
1181 2018-08-29 21:17:06 I've worked in the oil field in the Midwest and Texas and this exact phrase was used out there frequently back in the 70s and 80s. So it used to be fairly common.
1182 2018-08-29 21:16:58 @CadburyIreland Hey! Out of interest in the ingredients for dairy milk it says "vegetable fats (palm, shea)" Does the palm refer to palm oil?
1183 2018-08-29 21:16:45 With this mindset we can make oil money from non-oil engagements. See me in the other room
1184 2018-08-29 21:16:44 Of course he did... He also advocated for the manufacturer and promoter of Oxicontin and for Entergy's shut nuclear power plant Indian Point and Hugo Chavez's Chevron oil Co, among others.
1185 2018-08-29 21:16:40 Been waiting at Midas since 2:30 for this oil change. What makes it bad is that it was a scheduled appointment.......smh

1194 2018-08-29 21:15:59 So with all his good intentions,what did he do with d $393 Billion he made from crude oil in 4 years? I guess you might do justice to that
1195 2018-08-29 21:15:57 I expect the economy to have been doing better than it is doing now given the measures we put in place and the currentrevenue flow resulting from increases in crude oil price and increased production from our oil fields

1197 2018-08-29 21:15:52 Is she supposed to use the oil by herself???,,, 
1198 2018-08-29 21:15:50 I’m sure this won’t be popular, but we need to resource our oil and gas needs anyway. I like it.

1200 2018-08-29 21:15:42 My mother decides that she's in the mood to bake at 10:30 at night, only to realize there's no oil in the house. Best believe that she sends me to the neighbours house at 10:30pm to ask for a cup of oil .
1201 2018-08-29 21:15:40 as in foundation/makeup or to control oil?
1202 2018-08-29 21:15:39 Ok.... Here’s the deal.... Islamic Culture and A Juero-Christian Culture and like oil and water. They cannot and will not mix.
1203 2018-08-29 21:15:18 I completely agree. The man is a complete and utter disgrace. He isn't anything more than a two-bit con man and snake oil salesman and deserves to be in prison until his dying breath broken and alone.

1205 2018-08-29 21:14:52 A unique perspective on how much oil has been extracted from Earth. One reliable source gave a figure of 135 Billion barrels of oil extracted since 1850 when commercial extraction began. 135B oil barrels= 40.5Trillion Lbs.

1211 2018-08-29 21:14:12 You absolutely, 100% do not need oil. If that’s just a hamburger you need to lower the temp, and not cook a frozen one if that’s happening
1212 2018-08-29 21:14:11 The clown in office wants everything to turn back to the 40’s. And I can’t believe they can’t see the snack oil sales man for what it is. When people tell you who they are the first time believe them.

1220 2018-08-29 21:13:17 2020? Assume you mean 2014. Yes, that's the point: markets have devalued oil price since mid-2017.

1237 2018-08-29 21:11:31 Have you tried an oil cleanser? I have super acne prone skin but this helps to break makeup and dirt away and then I do a double cleanse kinda thing with a foaming cleanser after washing away the oil one. Wipes irritate my skin horribly, especially my eyes, so I had to switch.

1251 2018-08-29 21:09:47 Just so you know...there's a Mac-n-Cheese festival in Scottsdale in November.

We can host you.

Afterwards, we'll go visit an olive oil farm in Queen Creek.
1252 2018-08-29 21:09:42 Nope. Oil and coal are on way out.  Everyone is switching to green renewables... Pipelines destroy our water. 
1253 2018-08-29 21:09:39 Johnson's creamy baby oil. Amazing on dry skin!

1257 2018-08-29 21:08:43 Why do we care so much about Venezuela? I wonder if we didn’t pass sanctions or didn’t force Saudi Arabia to flood oil market which would result in Venezuela’s currency being devalued what would Venezuela be?

Live and let live...

1258 2018-08-29 21:08:40 How about the oil & gas industry keep their well sites away from schools & playgrounds in support of education for all students across #Colorado? It is difficult for anyone to learn & grow next to industrial sites. Noise, truck traffic, emissions & safety risks fail our students.
1259 2018-08-29 21:08:38 Put this traitor(cuomo) in boiling oil.

1260 2018-08-29 21:08:26 I drove back and forth across town twice because I was too anxious to make a decision on a place but I finally made it to get my oil changed 3,000 miles late please be proud of me I’m doing my best
1261 2018-08-29 21:08:05 Oil prices are down, good fun, not grinding my teeth at all
1262 2018-08-29 21:08:04 ROBOTSCUMOIL
1263 2018-08-29 21:07:49 Overheard in Islington today: ‘But almond milk is destroying everything isn’t it? And palm oil.’
1264 2018-08-29 21:07:44 Well it's coconut oil melting hot again this week.
1265 2018-08-29 21:07:39 That’s what’s up
1266 2018-08-29 21:07:14 I use sweet almond oil (about £4 from eBay) to moisturise and it's great!
1267 2018-08-29 21:07:11 Quand IbraTV dit « Cet bô oil » 
1268 2018-08-29 21:07:07 To rock out!!! I'll vote for Beto instead of that snake oil salesman. 
1269 2018-08-29 21:07:07 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.
1270 2018-08-29 21:07:02 So you can fill yourself with palm oil!  No thanks.
1271 2018-08-29 21:06:55 love it just love it thanks
1272 2018-08-29 21:06:52 Might as well get @bqldn Marvin Gaye Sensual massage and body oil to go with it girl!
1273 2018-08-29 21:06:45 @RealMichaelKay Tea tree oil is a very very strong smell it will clear your sinuses
1274 2018-08-29 21:06:33 A reminder to look for non palm oil products - #OrangutanJungleSchool
1275 2018-08-29 21:06:30 Can’t wait to go on @realsfn Friday and let the boys know that their joke about olive oil is more on point than they probably realize 
1276 2018-08-29 21:06:30 Duchesne's Ron Winterton says the first commercial oil well went in Ashley Valley in Duchesne County in 1948, been important ever since @NatResources @RepRobBishop #utpol
1277 2018-08-29 21:06:28 i go in for an oil change and they come back out with all of the things they could do to my car. no, just change the damn oil
1278 2018-08-29 21:06:15 The CPC blames the Libs for:
- starting a trade war trump started
- not negotiating when we are negotiating
- hurting oil industry when they bought them a pipeline
- hurting the economy by making an economic boom

No way to please ignorant, spoiled rich kids. #cdnpoli
1279 2018-08-29 21:06:08 for god's sake don't swap them for anything with coconut oil in  !then you would really get ill.
1280 2018-08-29 21:06:07 엄마가 시비걸어ㅡㅡ
1281 2018-08-29 21:06:05 i used nexoderm and tea tree oil
1282 2018-08-29 21:06:02 Trying this oil change thing again seriously could of told me I needed an appointment when I bought my truck
1283 2018-08-29 21:05:57 I've never heard of monatomic oil, care to share some more info?  ty
1284 2018-08-29 21:05:42 How does an oil changing place not have oil filters?? @Valvoline
1285 2018-08-29 21:05:13 What we are seeing in stocks is $50 silver...$7
corn....$140 oil....$170 live cattle...$17 beans....
Unsustainable price and upward price movement
on good news or bad.
This is not different not new
Irrational exuberance This does not end well but it ends soon
Real soon....
1286 2018-08-29 21:05:06 Definitely. Something I never considered until recently was where my hearing went completely in my left ear, for a couple of weeks...was with the aids my ears build up so much wax and me putting oil in to try clear it, it sealed up. That was worrying  Get adjustments Monday
1287 2018-08-29 21:05:06 oil ch changing it's changing ,oil @ $77 ukog @20p so if we hit 500bl in Portland that's the same as 1000bl last year now let's think about that , it gets better every day
1288 2018-08-29 21:04:39 I was told last night at a restaurant by a waitress that customers with celiac had told her that frying gf food in the same oil as gluten food removes the gluten 
1289 2018-08-29 21:04:35 Do you ever have such a terrible experience with a business that you think about downloading @Yelp just to write a bad review? That’s what’s currently happening with me and @pepboysauto one of the the worst experiences. 3.5 hours for an oil change? Really?
1290 2018-08-29 21:04:28 Insert first and second acts of interstellar here.... also as soon as the big companies realize oil money is failing and buy up renewables and act like they saved the day
1291 2018-08-29 21:04:11 Saudi oil is actually only a very small portion of our supply (~8-10%). Don’t fool yourself into thinking that we simply tolerate them because they have something we need. US leadership loves the Saudi regime for many, many more reasons.
1292 2018-08-29 21:04:09 Jesus Christ I thought that was blood before I realized it was oil
1293 2018-08-29 21:04:07 if we had 57 Jewish-maj. countries w/2 billion people across 100 million sq miles enriched by oil, they'd bully s/o else.
But Israel tech making the tiny country indispensible to IT progress 
w breakthroughs in medicine, agri, et al. Smart Jews. Hated by ignoramuses everywhere.
1294 2018-08-29 21:04:00 Well I have a plot of land covered in sheds with 3 generations of accumulated gubbins from various machines from outboard motors to wood chippers literal buckets of well.... rusty junk and bits of ... things , next time I’m changing oil or tightening my chain I’ll send some pics?
1295 2018-08-29 21:03:59 Then the 25% Pure gold oil is the way to go. Most customers get the full benefits from a rice grain sized amount, it is very potent.
1296 2018-08-29 21:03:58 What @realDonaldTrump should do is lower the military budget to no more than $40 billion and allocate at least $100 billion to @ENERGY for a new Manhattan Project to research alternative energy like algae oil, molten salt thorium reactors, lead-cooled fast breeder reactors, etc.
1297 2018-08-29 21:03:47 My PT stopped me mid-lunge tonight to tell me his maw text him:

"Went to put my eye drops in but picked up the wrong bottle and now I've drowned my eyes in vape oil."
1298 2018-08-29 21:03:46 Tried to get my oil changed on my break but they were too busy so I went n got my toes done instead  lol now I’m goin back to work 
1299 2018-08-29 21:03:38 Interestingly 2020 oil a lot higher than when CI was at the min. Different parts of curve changing views…
1300 2018-08-29 21:03:33 The aslaska fund is still going strong while state governments are cutting everything else and despite a big fall in the oil taxes that fund the Alaskan government.
1301 2018-08-29 21:03:06 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-08-29, is 1853.74.
1302 2018-08-29 21:02:37 Springing up? U make me laugh. Everything right now in Nigeria is LIFELESS. Even with oil prices over $70, GDP growth remains below 2%.  If you contest against Buhari, I will vote for you. Its that bad.
1303 2018-08-29 21:02:28 It looks like your heat was too high. Oil is very optional.
1304 2018-08-29 21:02:14 Sunni-Shi'a conflict (ea infidel to the oth) dates to 7th cent/won't soon be over; the contest for regional power btwn S Arabia (Sunni) and Iran (Shi'a) was inc'd by the W needing oil, tilting policy twd oil states, mostly Sunni =>proxy war in Yemen: a negot end wd dep on balance
1305 2018-08-29 21:02:14 My brother God bless you...Thank God say e rule o,because @OfficialAPCNg and their supporters no for let us hear word.abeg make I follow person dey think like me,abeg kfb.
1306 2018-08-29 21:02:14 Prediction: long-term, they know that within 100-200 years they & Canda will control the world supply of food.

They just need as many Governments as possible to continue postponing CO2 mitigations. Continue burning oil, keep burning gas. The ultimate "control of Western society"
1307 2018-08-29 21:02:12 Don’t eat sugar, white starch,  do take fish oil and don’t run ultras
1308 2018-08-29 21:02:02 whhhy is my face either an oil slick or dry as fuck just gimmie a nice complexion I ain’t got no time for these games
1309 2018-08-29 21:01:57 Spraying black oil all day. Just cleaned up but I’m looking like Billie joe Armstrong. Looking ancient Egyptian as fuck
1310 2018-08-29 21:01:56 If you <or your friend> have a high dollar Honda mower, it may list capacity in liters. Probably 20-30L at least. But those owner’s manuals are overly conservative, just keep pouring oil in that spinny part on top of the engine; that’s why it has all those little holes in it
1311 2018-08-29 21:01:55 it’s so hot out that my hot oil treatment from two days ago has been reactivated... #naturalhairproblems
1312 2018-08-29 21:01:53 O presidente americano Franklin Roosevelt criou o Escritório Interamericano — dirigido por Nelson Rockefeller, neto de John D. Rockefeller, fundador da Standard Oil, as atuais Exxon e Esso —, que tinha como única função levar a América Latina a apoiar os Aliados na Guerra.
1313 2018-08-29 21:01:51 I love the smell of tea tree oil like it's so calming
1314 2018-08-29 21:01:31 Where's are the Fakes @cnnbrk @CNN @jaketapper @wolfblitzer ? CNN lose interest in the issue? And the criminality? Or, we could ask the High Holy One, Cardinal @Comey or the security-clearance free @JohnBrennan , another snake oil salesman and bitter partisan.
1315 2018-08-29 21:01:08 Did you know? #Ants love to feed on sweets and fruit in addition to grease, oil, meats and corn meal. Sticky jars are exceptionally attractive to these invaders! #dyk
1316 2018-08-29 21:01:05 Lie! The 10% retained by the petroleum regulatory commission goes to who? Who takes care of the oil producing areas? @OfficialAPCNg please explain.
1317 2018-08-29 21:01:02 Just once I’d like to change my oil without getting dirty as fuck
1318 2018-08-29 21:01:02 Y’all laugh about how much 19th/20th century medicine got wrong, but think that putting some essential oil on your forehead and drinking that “detox” non-GMO organic fat flush you got from Pinterest is going to make up for those eight vodka cranberries you downed last night. #bye
1319 2018-08-29 21:00:55 Ergo - actually (not limited to planning..) killing people for oil must somehow be insufficient for somebody.
1320 2018-08-29 21:00:52 Ima start a Youtube channel where I buy collector’s items like retro games and then touch them with nasty stuff on my hands like peanutbutter or oil
1321 2018-08-29 21:00:39 The anti-fracking initiative in #Colorado has made the ballot despite HUGE attempts by Big Oil to stop it!  #BOOM
1322 2018-08-29 21:00:35 Arab oil billionaires where you at???
1323 2018-08-29 21:00:34 Depends on what you call socialist there is a wide range of definitions, with moving goal posts. If the price of oil was high and America had not imposed sanctions Venezuela would be doing well then it would be described as a mixed economy, which it is.

1325 2018-08-29 21:00:23 He wants you to say you see four lights when you only three. Deny what YOU see,  dismiss what you know to be fact & accept in place what he states is in front of you. He isn't selling snake oil,  he's selling himself,  the serpent
1326 2018-08-29 21:00:21 ‘I want to work in the oil industry’ BABY it’s over before it’s even started
1327 2018-08-29 21:00:20 August 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1328 2018-08-29 21:00:16 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1329 2018-08-29 21:00:16 Thought my oil pen broke but my battery was just dirty 
1330 2018-08-29 21:00:00 Campaign money from Big Oil.
1331 2018-08-29 20:59:48 lool alright i agree with the oil bit but it defeats the niceness of the rice & stew if it’s separated
1332 2018-08-29 20:59:44 HOW CAN ANYONE NOT BELIVE IN GOD ?  THE BIBLE FORTOLD SO MUCH HAPPENING ,,,, HOW BOUT A TIME OF NO LAW,,, ITS HERE,  FIRE ON THE WATER, OIL RIG FIRES, VOLCANO FIRES,,,  SO MUCH MORE
1333 2018-08-29 20:59:40 How did America go from a class act Barack Obama to some stark raving, fat, orange headed, egotistical, narcissistic, stupid, arrogant, condescending, rude, womanizing, offensive, deranged, clueless, carnival-like, lying,obscene, snake oil salesman?

And I mean every word I said
1334 2018-08-29 20:59:33 Evening Michael. Show after show we detail the political dimension to the crisis. Apologies if that didn’t come through just now. Surely though the oil price has brought a pressure given VZ’s reliance on it for income. Evidently though that is not the whole story. All the best
1335 2018-08-29 20:59:29 #FossilFuel has got to go. A state with so much sunshine and beauty should never be run by filthy oil barons. 

The wise money is on solar and renewables in CO.
1336 2018-08-29 20:59:21 International relationships that harm our nation? Yes destroy them. What if I told you there is more oil in the Earth today than ever before and that oil wasn't only made millions of years ago  but it's made every day for millions of years? Those "gonna run out" nuts are wrong.
1337 2018-08-29 20:59:18 I love how I barely trust anyone to drive my car and yet when I go to get my oil changed I just hand the man my keys like “hell yeah rev it up” 
1338 2018-08-29 20:59:09 As recently as July, a coordinated attack on two Saudi tankers by Yemeni rebels in the Gulf of Aden prompted Riyadh to shut down transit through the strait and caused a spike in global oil prices. This is a crisis that cannot be ignored by the world’s lone superpower. The only
1339 2018-08-29 20:59:03 olive oil is everything
1340 2018-08-29 20:58:55 So the general rule of thumb to cooking at the very basic level is:
#1 preheat your pan
#2 add oil or butter whatever your recipe calls for
#3 Cook your food
^The order of which ingredients you cook first adds multi-layers to this step.
1341 2018-08-29 20:58:51 Empires come and go. If/when oil is not backed by dollar anymore, I want to see how long it ll last as the dominant currency.
1342 2018-08-29 20:58:44 Make him paint a picture with oil colour and on canvas, And he has to be serious about it! AND he will gift it to grark and granji!
1343 2018-08-29 20:58:39 "Why don't you ever call me for something simple like an oil change?" 
~My mechanic earlier today.  
1344 2018-08-29 20:57:54 Sis the oil ruins the food sometimes and also when it’s separate it looks better
1345 2018-08-29 20:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!

I’ve gotten Starbucks 2x, caught Pokémon, gotten an oil change, spent too much in Marshalls (Halloween stuff!!), ate a lot of hamburger rice soup, watched so much Teen Wolf, done laundry and dishes, and laid on the couch
1350 2018-08-29 20:56:40 Oil business is oily. Buhari has been having an oily, shady business in the NNPC but Mr integrity is fighting corruption

1360 2018-08-29 20:55:22 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.

1366 2018-08-29 20:54:56 Everything is fine, the oil drain plug was left loose.
1367 2018-08-29 20:54:21 #USA:
We gonna stay in #Syria till #Damascus give us Oil Exploration Rights in NE Syria.

Let me get this straight...you done (and continue to do so) almost everything thing possible to DESTROY Syria...and now you want to be REWARD for that with Oil exploration Rights ? 
1368 2018-08-29 20:54:08 Pour six cups of olive oil and set aside.
1369 2018-08-29 20:53:47 @BigwheelMcNeil how hot is your grill? I can’t seem to get a good sear at home on a stainless pan. Should I oil it maybe?
1370 2018-08-29 20:53:45 But my HORN shall thou exalt like, the horn of an unicorn: i shall be anoited with fresh oil.
Psalms 92 vs 10.
1371 2018-08-29 20:53:32 Why are hybrids more expensive?
Why are hybrid repairs so expensive?
Why are freaking oil changes double the price!?

Does the 55+ mpg make up for all of that^?

1373 2018-08-29 20:53:07 @BBCOS @BBCRosAtkins No, 2m+ people have not migrated from Venezuela because of "the fall in the oil price". If that were so, would see mass migration from other oil exporters. It's because of corrupt mismanagement +dictatorship. When will you get Vzla right?
1374 2018-08-29 20:53:04 "While sauce almost never refers to salad dressings, dressing for its part sometimes refers to oil, vinegar, etc. as a sauce or marinade for meats. Dressing is only used in the context of salad. It would be incorrect to say that a salad was in a sauce."

1382 2018-08-29 20:51:58 Random Hot Take of the Day™

Whoever it was that looked at perfectly good tuna, just waiting to go in a can for later tuna-related goodness, and said to themselves, "I know, we'll pour vegetable oil all over it," should go down in the annals of history as a terrible person.
1383 2018-08-29 20:51:37 Buhari has refused assent to PIGBill bcos it would reduce his powers. He is interested in powers that would make him control the Oil sector and not how Nigeria would work. I'm certain FoI bill passed by GEJ would have suffered setback if it was today. Buhari's integrity is a scam
1384 2018-08-29 20:51:31 A pretence to fighting Bolo Haram.Their main target is to kill #Biafrans  and secure their oil business. The war would be fought in the #UK too, enough of #Biafrakillings.
1385 2018-08-29 20:51:09 Basically we had a baby boom in the US just after WW2 and they grew up to be the most odious people imaginable.
1386 2018-08-29 20:51:05 Another reason we don't need any more fracking going forward, especially around homes and schools. Plus, we will need less oil as we transition to electric vehicles.
1387 2018-08-29 20:50:51 There's a blue stone that is dipped in methylated spirit and applied too. I remember my midwife here's face when I told her we put eucalyptus oil on the scalp of the new born baby.  She was like 'naaaa we don't do that here' .They need to unlearn certain practices.
1388 2018-08-29 20:50:49 Oh! Senator Ben Dover (to Big Oil) wanna lecture the personal about disagreements?
1389 2018-08-29 20:50:46 Why are so many oil workers in multinational corporations on contract? Contract workers are mostly casual workers who are poorly paid and not on pension. #Abandonedbygovernment.
1390 2018-08-29 20:50:36 If that oil is refined, we can then ask "Is corn gas?"
1391 2018-08-29 20:50:25 You can get it at christmas tree shops! Tea tree oil smells while you use it but once you wash it out you dont smell it!
1392 2018-08-29 20:50:17 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1393 2018-08-29 20:50:16 people need to go vegan, ditch fossil fuels for solar power, ditch plastic & palm oil. marching all the time doesn't solve problems. time to take responsibility for own actions that affect whole world!
1394 2018-08-29 20:50:15 Everyone: Omg, Look at his curls. They're so perfect! How do you keep them so tight and curly?

Me: Special conditoner, Coconut oil, Anti friz leave in conditoner, and cantu shea butter.

Mixed curls are ridiculous to maintain.. I skip one step and it's frizzy fro day 
1395 2018-08-29 20:50:11 Xa usuze usele castor oil,  underwear iba neStain forever... Uyeva xa uhamba uba hayi kumtyibilizi in between!!!
1396 2018-08-29 20:50:06 Nope.

Any world goverment established will balkanize & collapse as abrupt climate change & peak cheap oil play out.

I think regional self-reliance (necessarily w/ self-governance) is a key adaptation strategy for our predicaments.

Ecocidal communism was bad too, and brutal.
1397 2018-08-29 20:49:34 A little over 10 years ago, Hugo Chavez was distributing free heating oil to poor Americans.

His legacy will be a ruined Venezuela (Yes, he is to blame, not the "imperialists").
1398 2018-08-29 20:49:31 My dad made me got get my oil change ALONE!!!!! I’ve never been so confused in my whole entire life
1399 2018-08-29 20:49:18 First of all, many soups are delightful. A watermelon cucumber gazpacho with mint oil or a chilled strawberry bisque (my favorite food), for example. Second, oatmeal isn't gross at all.

1401 2018-08-29 20:49:06 You don't need oil, the fat in the meat helps cook it. Just use a lower temp and flip earlier.
1402 2018-08-29 20:49:04 Finally getting an oil change on Friday 
1403 2018-08-29 20:49:02 @grazedotcom do your products use palm oil in them?

1405 2018-08-29 20:48:56 SUCH a bummer about the coconut oil turning hard in this cold weather! 
1406 2018-08-29 20:48:35 The only way it comes short term to your target is if #ukog say there is no oil and clearly by the tankers there is!! #angs will steadily rise over the coming weeks. Stop deramping and join the journey!! All aboard Choo choo

1409 2018-08-29 20:48:13 It also Kapler’s first year ever as coach. Holding him to a higher standard because he thinks his team is a contender is fine, but I don’t think any of us thought he would take the team this far. We all made fun of the coco oil. Players are good, but failing at their strengths.
1410 2018-08-29 20:48:11 Oil dey your head...
1411 2018-08-29 20:48:04 I don't use oil. Sear on one side for a min or two depending on heat of pan, then flip, pour about 1/2 cup of water in and cover so they steam. Finish in about 5 or 6 min
1412 2018-08-29 20:47:57 虹色lettersイヤホンで聴いたらやばい
1413 2018-08-29 20:47:55 You can take this type of thinking and look and the counties that have collapsed when the government gets involved in business. Look at venezuela and how that is working out for them. The government took over the oil businesses and others and look at them.
1414 2018-08-29 20:47:44 Con el petróleo subiendo, dólar en Argentina en alza a $ 34,50 (hoy), valor promedio del precio de la nafta a u$s 1,23 x litro. u$s 1,10 Gas Oil. Correcciones al valor de las naftas ???
1415 2018-08-29 20:47:24 Numbers reported in the current week are gathered from last week. Likewise, hurricane Harvey hasn't yet "hit" the year ago data.   In addition, a year ago, oil prices were ~$20/bbl lower.
1416 2018-08-29 20:47:00 Public service announcement!!! If you hit hoes raw and the bitch just won’t get wet or you wanna go deep on a big booty hoe. Well you need to try Dookie Love fine lubricant and body oil.  #trillville
1417 2018-08-29 20:46:54 It’s a liquid coconut oil kind of day. 
1418 2018-08-29 20:46:40 i really need to quit procrastinating because i had four months of summer and now i’m painting my room changing my oil and cutting my hair all in one day
1419 2018-08-29 20:46:34 Just put water on it and keep cold water on it for ages, it’s what we do at work when we get burnt by the chip fryer oil xxx
1420 2018-08-29 20:46:33 Its a wonderful #Ratio factory.
1421 2018-08-29 20:46:29 Offshore oil and gas prices doing well are they? Ask one of yours
1422 2018-08-29 20:46:10 @janapochop first oil change- $47 :)
1423 2018-08-29 20:45:58 Agreed not only for the Racing but also for everybody in and around Lucas Oil that day too.
1424 2018-08-29 20:45:46 Think City missed a trick not naming that documentary of theirs “Oil or nothing” tbh. Would have been a more accurate assessment of their achievements 
1425 2018-08-29 20:45:34 My oil is leaking  I dunno if I should just abandon it or risk oily clothes
1426 2018-08-29 20:45:33 yeah it's turned into contact dermatitis, apparently 5% of people react like that to tea tree oil and I'm one of them! 
1427 2018-08-29 20:45:28 @RealMichaelKay Crew Shampoo is good & the conditioner has tea teee oil infused
1428 2018-08-29 20:45:25 You only don't need oil if you are using normal fat minced meat. And even then adding a bit of oil is fine just to be safe.
1429 2018-08-29 20:45:24 bro it does not take 2 and a half hours to change my oil, i better have a whole new car when they get done
1430 2018-08-29 20:45:12 Love that one. “I’m rich. Gotta a million bucks. Oil in Bakersfield...”
1431 2018-08-29 20:45:04 You never forget oil in rogue.
1432 2018-08-29 20:45:02 Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!

1433 2018-08-29 20:44:50 Still waiting to receive my sample of your face oil. If I like it I’ll buy it from amazon
1434 2018-08-29 20:44:35 wheres Bluto and olive oil ...already on grick salad?
1435 2018-08-29 20:44:33 glad the oil diffuser is going to good use!!
1436 2018-08-29 20:44:33 Bross Omokri tell Nigerian about your involvement in 1Trillion of our oil Money.

1438 2018-08-29 20:44:26 Roasted. Coated in coconut oil with some garam masala. Best carrot recipe ever!
1439 2018-08-29 20:44:25 @RealMichaelKay shampoo called Fairy Tale! Has the tea tree oil in it!
1440 2018-08-29 20:44:17 You need a fat to some sort—oil or butter. Keep it on low-med heat and be patient. Depending on thickness, flip after 3-5 minutes.
1441 2018-08-29 20:44:16 @RealMichaelKay I also can vouch for Tea Tree Oil - my wife doesn't send out our daughter without it.
1442 2018-08-29 20:43:58 @TMKSESPN @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca anyone who thinks tea tree oil smells good is a certified psycopath it is an offensive odor to the highest degree
1443 2018-08-29 20:43:54 @BBCRosAtkins reports that Venezuelan exodus, the largest in history of S America, is caused by low oil prices! Posing as a hard core journalist Atkins seems to forget price is currently very high and exodus began in 2014 when oil was $100/bbl can’t blame socialism on the BBC!
1444 2018-08-29 20:43:54 Ignorance and poor leadership  are like water and oil, they just don't mix
1445 2018-08-29 20:43:53 Oil n Gas guru in the making
1446 2018-08-29 20:43:50 Lord, if you’d let it rain, I’d tithed any entire month’s oil check! 
1447 2018-08-29 20:43:43 “Crucially, the list of requests also included that the US have a role in Syria's eastern oil fields, according to Reuters, citing Al-Akhbar. Currently, a number of major oil and gas fields fall in areas under the control of Kurdish and US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.”
1448 2018-08-29 20:43:42 I wanted to get FanMaxx so I asked the shop attendant for a bottle and she couldn't seem to find one.
Then I was like if she can't find one, she can give me a bottle of Frytol oil rather
The look on her face was priceless!! 
I don't have to tell her I'm not drinking it right?
1449 2018-08-29 20:43:30 Good question.  And who got rid of all that evidence?  #SomethingIsRotten
1450 2018-08-29 20:43:27 So what exactly should I get? An oil? Gummies?
1451 2018-08-29 20:43:25 @TMKSESPN Tea Tree oil shampoo by Paul Mitchell is the greatest shampoo!  Smells great and feels even better.
1452 2018-08-29 20:43:09 Mtoe - tonnes of oil equiv. - so primary energy by end use.
1453 2018-08-29 20:42:56 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca Tea tree oil smells like burning tires meets roadkill
1454 2018-08-29 20:42:46 Brady is a thief. A criminal for his oil donors. We saw what you did Kevin. You stole 4TRILLION$ in wealth from hardworking Americans to give huge tax cuts to the rich & corps. They’re making millions, while workers wages are decreasing. YOU LIED TO AMERICA.
1455 2018-08-29 20:42:36 @RealMichaelKay 
use a very small amount in the kids shampoo.Tea Tree oil smells awful! On the plus side lice don’t like it
1456 2018-08-29 20:42:21 today I made sure I had a free couple of hours to take care of myself; did a pedicure, my weekly face mask, my pre-shampoo oil routine, a nice cool shower, my post shower skin routine and wore my fav pjs and I feel really good rn

1458 2018-08-29 20:42:06 Easy side dish of rice:
In a medium skillet, add some fresh garlic, and chopped onion and pepper. Coat with olive oil, add 2 tbsp butter and fry until onions caramelize. Add black pepper and 
 season salt, then stir in 2C uncooked rice. Add 4C vegetable broth and cook until done
1459 2018-08-29 20:41:56 This week on WTF is my life, my old boss is texting me about getting CBD oil for my migraines.
1460 2018-08-29 20:41:54 Yes.. guzzling clove oil. It's such a saga... my mouth
1461 2018-08-29 20:41:48 Then after i use this spray toner that i found at i think the bath and body works shop.... idk dont quote me on that. But its this tea tree oil spray toner and it makes my skin rlly refreshed! And feel vry clean!
1462 2018-08-29 20:41:47 Gotta get off the oil train ....really!
1463 2018-08-29 20:41:45 I have tea tree oil and it doesn’t smell bad at all @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca
1464 2018-08-29 20:41:43 Canadian oil is good for the country economy and the world. it does not fund terrorism and is cleaner than alternatives by a huge margin. I may burn a tank on the track this weekend in your honour.
1465 2018-08-29 20:41:39 Anybody know if you can fail a drug test or DOT Physical if you use non THC CBD oil?
1466 2018-08-29 20:41:30 Just tired of always drinking sugary pop, and movie theater popcorn is just oil and chemical flavour that makes me feel gross afterward.
1467 2018-08-29 20:41:29 watching orangutan documentaries writing emails to companies that use palm oil. feels like old times #ami11again
1468 2018-08-29 20:41:27 Your fan base is dwindling. You can’t just keep on lying without some of your “fans” dropping from the tree. Truth is truth, you sell snake oil.
1469 2018-08-29 20:41:24 I’m so fucking nervous and I forgot my anxiety medication and lavender oil to calm me down
1470 2018-08-29 20:41:23 Needs oil
1471 2018-08-29 20:41:22 it tasted ok, considering i did not have chinese seasoning . I think in restaurants they use a special oil for WOKs , rice tends to stick to base -- hey --you look fairly delicious yourself --ha ha  
1472 2018-08-29 20:41:17 Lol or not, literally says “oil, coal and gas”. Be interesting to compare watt hour per request. I’d think things are pretty efficient these days.

My bad for trying to give people benefit of the doubt..
1473 2018-08-29 20:41:16 Good for you!  That's great.  I have friend who swears by mj oil of some sort for pain after football. Not my thing. I have concerns. If medicinal and oil or pill etc then thats diff than smoking.  Admittedly I'm no expert
1474 2018-08-29 20:41:12 @RealMichaelKay I make my own beard oil and tea tree oil smells amazing... actually my number seller...
1475 2018-08-29 20:41:01 After washing my face with a cleanser i put tea tree oil on my scars and it helps clear them up vry well
1476 2018-08-29 20:40:57 That is not real smart. Oil appears on the way to ‘j100/bbl and you folks stop the drilling.
1477 2018-08-29 20:40:52 @TMKSESPN fairytale lice repellent, has tea tree oil and smells great. It’s also a hair detangler too.
1478 2018-08-29 20:40:32 It's a clear tactical political move for @APCNigeria as they target Oil producing States that they lost in 2015 to @OfficialPDPNig

1480 2018-08-29 20:40:21 The food you eat is due to outdated technologies (oil) feeling the plowing and planting, harvesting, and bringing of food to your neighbourhood. The laptop you are typing on is full of parts that were made from raw materials sourced from outdated technologies (oil)
1481 2018-08-29 20:40:16 @TMKSESPN tea tree oil smells like horse manure x 10.

1483 2018-08-29 20:40:14 @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay tea tree oil smells AMAZING. Places like Bath & Body Works have shampoo with it already in it.

1486 2018-08-29 20:39:59 So who wants to pay for my oil change? 
1487 2018-08-29 20:39:58 In the army they used mineral oil in areas with freezing weather so they can take quick dumps outside without freezing their asses solid

1490 2018-08-29 20:39:51 @DonLagreca tea tree oil smells like peppermint
1491 2018-08-29 20:39:47 I make My own perfume! I dilute lavender, sage, and vanilla essential oils in sweet almond oil
1492 2018-08-29 20:39:36 Gonna be honest as a fan of drinking obnoxiously red liquids, shimano mineral oil (bicycle brake fluid) looks delicious
1493 2018-08-29 20:39:30 no he won’t, notice he had nothing on PSG or any of the domestic league owners in that region? Notice how there’s no articles about Russia oil owners and their human rights issues?
1494 2018-08-29 20:39:19 @106Euan is definitely right, we know these people are running scared of Tesla, all of them..care makers, big oil, shorters etc etc. They seem to not understand that stopping Tesla will not stop the change, the EVolution....
1495 2018-08-29 20:39:17 I have a FREE technique they could use to clean & reuse the water yet the women at their corporate offices want to steal & patent the idea so other oil companies would have to pay them. Ask greedy ceo's if they can afford to pay a modest fee to a single mom to resolve this issue.
1496 2018-08-29 20:39:09 Global oil demand drop of 1mb/d? Are you seriously predicting that?
1497 2018-08-29 20:39:08 It should be regulated and not given to young kids. I’ve also seen cannabis oil be a life saver for young kids who are stricken with seizures for various reasons. There is an old stigma that has always surrounded MJ. There are factual studies that prove much of that wrong.
1498 2018-08-29 20:39:02 #PIGB not signed because someone did not understand the importance of the Bill for total freedom for Oil and gas @trafficbutter @Gidi_Traffic
1499 2018-08-29 20:38:56 Internacional press insisting that the Venezuela crisis is the result of drop of oil prices. It is NOT the whole story. MISMANAGEMENT & CORRUPTION are the REAL CAUSE.
1500 2018-08-29 20:38:53 They do not want Iran fighting the Israeli supported terrorists while they themselves have stole the Golan Heights from Syria because it is full of oil. As a terrorism exporting country they are proud to be a member of the triangle of evil.

1507 2018-08-29 20:38:05 @chevrolet I was wondering if you all test out your regular parts because I did an oil change recently on a new 2018 Cruze and the oil drain plug got stripped with little effort.
1508 2018-08-29 20:37:59 I definitely put way too much MCT oil in my coffee earlier and am now paying the price. 
1509 2018-08-29 20:37:51 Oil back at nearly $70 a barrel for WTI. If only Canada could somehow get a better price for our WCS...
1510 2018-08-29 20:37:48 Girl even olive oil?? Omg
1511 2018-08-29 20:37:45 Any kind of oil will suffocate it, then flush your ear with warm water.
1512 2018-08-29 20:37:26 Ok I will try..just put 45Ltr oil, 25kg tool box, drill, grinder, spares, sack cart on my bicycle, Derby tomorrow..going to be a late one

1522 2018-08-29 20:36:54 Two different conversations about "hanged, drawn, and quartered" online today.

I prefer the longer form: "Shot, hanged, drawn, quartered, boiled in oil, and served up on toast points with [sour cream and] capers." It's those little details that help paint the picture so vividly.

1524 2018-08-29 20:36:46 Yessss. Use castor oil! You can buy some on amazon. (You only need the smaller bottle FYI) it comes with eyebrow brush and eyelash wand 
1525 2018-08-29 20:36:38 I mixed Jamaican black castor oil, avocado oil, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, and aloe Vera oil and my hair feels so bomb 
1526 2018-08-29 20:36:33 Elite puff puff is so rare because everyone just likes to drench it in oil 
1527 2018-08-29 20:36:19 L’huile de ricin est une huile végétale obtenue après pression des graines de ricin. Le ricin est une plante originaire d’Afrique orientale , qui s’est facilement acclimatée dans la région méditerranéenne. On l’appelle aussi Castor oil
1528 2018-08-29 20:36:15 Any oil will help :,)

1535 2018-08-29 20:35:08 Been arguing with my mamaw that my car needs oil and she thinks I’m retarded..took it to the shop today with the tiny bit of oil she gave me and they put it in.. pulled the dip stick out and it was still dry af!!!
1536 2018-08-29 20:35:08 @BBCRosAtkins no, the collapse in Venezuela is not because the price of oil has gone down (it’s not even very low right now). It’s because of the socialist government. Why can’t you say that?
1537 2018-08-29 20:35:03 @HighwaysWMIDS surely your advert should include lights as well as fuel, oil and tyres, when did lights not be a requirement? #roadsafety

1539 2018-08-29 20:34:57 Don't you think your time might be better spent trying to come up with ideas and platforms that actually effect Albertans. The only thing Albertans can trust you to do if elected is whine and criticize. What's your plan for the economy when oil tanks again?
1540 2018-08-29 20:34:52 Sometimes I think it’s better if I just sold my car and took Uber/Lyft everywhere. No gas, insurance, oil changes, tires, repairs, headaches, etc  shit adds up.
1541 2018-08-29 20:34:36 Same principle as burning oil drums - it isn't the heat, it's the air movrment.

1547 2018-08-29 20:34:02 One time I asked griffin to get me caster oil on the way home for my hair and lashes and he thought I meant Castrol oil and he literally came home with Castrol oil and handed it to me like “You put this on your hair??? Doesn’t it smell?”
1548 2018-08-29 20:33:55 make "snake oil" literally again?
1549 2018-08-29 20:33:49 In the name of egocentric optics, your insecurity re-enslaved is to Big Oil/Finance/Pharma/etc. You are a fake president. You are being crushed and held to account by REAL America.
1550 2018-08-29 20:33:25 Foreclosure. The world isn't a bank, if it was greece would be called new germany. We don't buy as much oil anymore from Saudi Arabia bc of fracking.
1551 2018-08-29 20:33:19 What kind of oil diffuser do you have? Send me a pic
1552 2018-08-29 20:33:08 After that shit storm I told you how to make your 200 back without loss and offered you my kitchen to make the oil and my help and you never followed up I heard back from you maybe a year later. But when we laid it out you didnt wanna hear shit. So now let's air it out.
1553 2018-08-29 20:32:48 Did you mix different types of oil together? Or it might just be the oil is not good
1554 2018-08-29 20:32:35 Almost feel for this guy...no more left to go to..and settle in with policy.  All taken up by Liberals...after abortion and legal pot, what's left? Leap Manifesto, I suppose...takeover of oil fields, no wait, Liberals got Kinder pipes for start anyway. Singh's walking the plank!
1555 2018-08-29 20:32:27 I thought they decided to increase production in June specifically for this reason!  
Regardless, global oil demand declines by about 1 mb/d or more in Q1: here you go, that compensates on its own!
1556 2018-08-29 20:32:16 ...We do not belong there, the US needs to leave oil rich, Middle-Eastern countries alone & worry about ourselves. When you look at the whole history between Iran & the US, WE are the bad guys. Please read a book & not just right-wing propaganda websites. Thank you...
1557 2018-08-29 20:32:12 You can also use apple sauce as a replacement for oil
1558 2018-08-29 20:32:08 ...remove Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister (who helped his people) & replaced him with the Shah (who starved & murdered his own people) because the Shaw would sell us his county’s oil instead of using it to help the people of Iran, like the previous Minister did...
1559 2018-08-29 20:31:52 An older gentleman I work with doesn't believe in climate change, thinks hybrids are "losing popularity," told me that you could get a new LUXURY car for the price of a new Prius, and that we should frac for oil anywhere we can. 

Interesting take.

1591 2018-08-29 20:27:14 Venezuela is a failed state but why ?
Is it because it was a socialist state ?
Or because the naivety of the state to base its 95% of the economy on oil ?
This is the second crash to happen in Venezuela which happened in the 70s again was it due to economy naivety or socialism
1592 2018-08-29 20:27:10 Removes excess oil and dirt anything left after you cleanse, bas if it makes you dry/red consider changing the formula? +depends on the ingredients if you’re using a toner with salicylic acid it’s good for oily skin, dry skin try more hydrating ingredients

1619 2018-08-29 20:23:56 All feathers, no chicken. I get that it skews the public numbers, and messes with sentiment, but it doesn't make more oil, and that, in the end, is the chicken dinner we're all waiting to be served.

1628 2018-08-29 20:22:29 There’s a lot to be said for the oil trade, but just using it as another stick to beat the ‘orrible West with is as ridiculous as it is disgusting.

1630 2018-08-29 20:22:08 With oil price rocketed today look at #PTR producing over 1000 bopd from a 50m barrel field and just few days ago with another discovery of potential to be 40m barrels all that for just £10m MCAP where will you get a oily at that price
1631 2018-08-29 20:21:54 But from a broad perspective, a rural area must either be completely self-sustaining, or have something of value to trade.

E. KY must bring in food, oil, etc. So without coal to export, there simply can’t be enough small businesses creating value to sustain the region.
1632 2018-08-29 20:21:42 Getting oil changes makes me feel too responsible and old

1665 2018-08-29 20:15:51 They always get destroyed when an industry fundamentally changes.
Look at all the oil people who were demolished when the price collapsed.
As a generalist I got out of the way while they were jumping into the fray.

1673 2018-08-29 20:15:24 I'm a manager in a garage. It's women that come in unable to check the tyre pressure unable to check.the oil and water and it's women that come in for the most accident repair estimates.
1674 2018-08-29 20:15:17 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
1675 2018-08-29 20:14:48 Just once I wanna go into Mr. Lube and need nothing else done to my car other than the scheduled oil change I went in there for.
1676 2018-08-29 20:14:43 You set the bar so high with your oil and footjob video so I am excited to see how this video will turnout.
1677 2018-08-29 20:14:21 Two things - chili oil is God’s gift to us mere mortals, as is Dangerous Woman, which is still the home of ALL BOPS. Thank you God, China, and @ArianaGrande

1687 2018-08-29 20:12:34 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
1688 2018-08-29 20:12:22 Deep condition your bleached hair on the regular. Argan oil is your best friend. Use alot of moisture locking hair butters that are easy to absorb.
1689 2018-08-29 20:12:12 No but it does use coconut oil. I haven't tried it yet so idk if it is any good but I always used to put condensed milk in my tea so I'm hoping it'll be a good replacement.
1690 2018-08-29 20:12:10 Just read an article on replacing palm oil in soap recipes (which I did ages ago). It contained no new info. 
1691 2018-08-29 20:11:12 Brutal. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. So brutal.

1697 2018-08-29 20:09:55 If you're environmentally aware when it comes to your food and health and beauty products, y'all should be trying to cut out palm oil/calling out manufacturers who use palm oil.

1700 2018-08-29 20:09:33 Here is what our rotten news won't tell you.  The Iranian parliament censured the top guy. Their econ is about ready to fold.   The USA reinserted sanctions in May.   Oil export is dismal.    Very likely new leadership   they won't tell us this because Trump might get credit.
1701 2018-08-29 20:09:32 @Michelle4NM, a #PUBLICBANK like @BankofND would go a long way to support Agriculture and pay for roads - and reduce our dependence on the #BoomOrBust Oil&Gas AND likely reduce Taxpayer burdens while improving services.
1702 2018-08-29 20:09:18 I don't care what he has crystallized in the minds of whoever the fuck this critical mass is and if you repeat that vacuous phrase one more time I'll be inclined to believe the only thing crystallizing in your mind is hash oil. REGARDLESS OF HIS PLATFORM, IT'S THE WRONG TIME!

1704 2018-08-29 20:09:14 If a bitch need some oil then a bitch need some oil  what she suppose to wait for a nigga to get it for her ?
1705 2018-08-29 20:09:13 What the hell dose US oil exports have to do with TELAQ?  EV’s will help increase this making the US stronger in world trade!
1706 2018-08-29 20:08:46 As I mentioned in the past, the most significant risk to oil prices is what you have just described: rising US dollar while the currencies of the emerging economies are plummeting.  This makes oil expensive where most of the expected growth in demand is.

Trump just says what comes to his head and can't spell politically correct. 

"I'LL BOMB THE $HIT OUT OF THEM AND STEAL THEIR OIL" TRUMP

"BOM BOM BOM BOMB BOMB IRAN" MCCAIN

At the base it's the same thing.
1711 2018-08-29 20:08:13 I have a busy life & belong to several organisations so meet a variety of ppl but I don’t live in a city. I do know a female oil rig engineer, she worked worldwide but gave it up to have children.
1712 2018-08-29 20:08:06 Nor does algea oil... It would be interesting to know wether a 1:1 OMG3/6 ratio does...
1713 2018-08-29 20:07:52 His “principles” at this point are: I’ve become actually somewhat well-known by talking shit about Trump, so I want to keep this following/revenue stream. Therefore, I’m going to not vote GOP in Rhode Island, where there aren’t any US House or Senate Rs anyway. Big F’ing deal.

1722 2018-08-29 20:06:40 So for my people who suffer from constant sinus infections, try about 5 drops of peppermint oil on your pillow(bare pillow then put on the pillowcase) It’s been really helping me out. Also stay away from dairy for about a 7 days.

1727 2018-08-29 20:05:23 CBD oil has worked wonders for me.
1728 2018-08-29 20:05:19 Also I'm assuming cleaning out the oil would be a pain in the butt.
1729 2018-08-29 20:05:18 This dude next to me in the parking lot at Walmart just put oil in his windshield washer fluid. So im going to just sit this one out and let natural selection do it's thing.
1730 2018-08-29 20:05:18 The shit you guys fall for. Not taking a $400,000 salary while cutting his own taxes to the tune of hundreds of millions. All of the golf at his resorts, paid for by US.

1750 2018-08-29 20:03:03 This certainly is a reasonable and valid concern. Hope the investors see this as a cost of doing business in today’s environment, keep an eye on the prize and still proceed...this is the best time to invest in US oil and gas infrastructure projects

1772 2018-08-29 20:00:14 polictics, both sides are failing a large population segment. people's interest just can't be for those who narrow-mindedly benefit from oil, medicine or law. maybe it's time to consider options via privatization + diversification while time still available todo so @justtrini1
1773 2018-08-29 20:00:09 Shame that poachers and palm oil are killing off beautiful orangutans...fairplay to @IcelandFoods for cutting palm oil in their own brand foods... Small steps, hope other companies follow suit.

1810 2018-08-29 19:54:30 Not so much right now. The regime wasted the money and neglected to invest and maintain oil infrastructures. So they extract less than ever.
1811 2018-08-29 19:53:57 This whole "right to try" Think @realDonaldTrump  pushed out is just bait for snake oil salesman to milk money out of desperate people.  While I see major concerns in @SenSanders Medicare for all type setup i think its a whole lot less then what we have now.

1919 2018-08-29 19:39:13 And one final thought: $1,100 once a year does so very little here to offset the cost of living. No production, and most jobs are either in oil, mining or with the state. It kinda is pointless at this point to even have a PFD unless you have 10 kids, which some families do.

1937 2018-08-29 19:37:01 Rising healthcare costs are actually because of Obama. I’m not seeing rising gas prices with our increased oil production thanks to President Trump. It’s also hard to beat a 4.2% GDP. What was Obama’s average GDP?
1938 2018-08-29 19:36:57 Am I gonna get my nails done, get an oil change or cook dinner? Because I doubt I do all 3. Or just go to sleep

1943 2018-08-29 19:36:19 really hit home. Just recently had parents move in and mum only uses coconut oil; we never had clogs previously. 2x now we've had stringy greens require dismantling the pipes under the sink. Can't stop laughing because she swears it's great...why then the clogs mom?

1945 2018-08-29 19:35:27 what reforms?  don't see the needed ones yet.  China's reduced surplus a function of the 15/16 fiscal stimulus and higher oil in my view.  Not policies that will durably reduce household savings ...
1946 2018-08-29 19:35:15 PROOF that most Americans are distracted: 1. The U.S. economy is at risk of being robbed ANY DAY by a handful of "normal appearing" psychiatric cases; Wall Street traders; 2) the U.S economy is dependent upon war, oil, taxes, govt waste, China, Russia, Mexico, N.

1947 2018-08-29 19:35:05 I've actually put arugula on pizza and it's very tasty! The only sauces I typical put on pizza is olive oil, so it works really well with the arugula. I use a lot of garlic, too. 
And artichokes are great on pizza. 
Portabella mushrooms and eggplant, too.

1951 2018-08-29 19:34:29 You probably wouldn't like it, unfortunately. Tofu, minced meat, garlic greens, very spicy/funky sauce (usually incorporating fermented chilies and black beans, Sichuan peppercorns, chili oil...) It's a flavor bomb.

1958 2018-08-29 19:33:26 The Military exists to protect our borders. Period. Not Asians from communism, or oil companies' foreign projects, or Muslims from dictators.

2000 2018-08-29 19:29:13 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

2010 2018-08-29 19:28:09 Yeah, let's ignore all of the examples that work and focus on the one example that didn't work. Venezuela's problems are a result of corruption and an economy that relies completely on oil.

2019 2018-08-29 19:27:05 between 2015 to 2016 no oil based economy that didn't experience economic hardship, perhaps you don't know that.
2020 2018-08-29 19:27:03 The PFD is also because the state took away all private ownership of oil found on private lands. So, if you find oil on your land, it is not yours. The PFD was a way of compensating for that. Although I have posed that question to fellow Alaskans, they disagree......

2035 2018-08-29 19:24:09 Estimated 2m  people fled Venezuela since 2014. That country's economy has been run down by a highly incompetent/despotic leadership despite its large oil wealth.

2060 2018-08-29 19:19:41 You can't compare Benni &Lukaku with Gabuza. European football and SAn football is like water and oil. There, in a season, a top goal scorer has 30+ goals in a season, here 11 or 10. And player development is not the same& the PSL is a defensive minded league. bare that in mind.
2061 2018-08-29 19:19:16 Got my oil changed, car washed, bought a new shower loofa thingee and now...a beer or two cuz enough of that productive nonsense
2062 2018-08-29 19:19:12 @slaterradio what’s better oil from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela?
2063 2018-08-29 19:19:06 By the way...what did Donald Trump want with the President of Kenya?  And why would the President of Kenya sit down with Trump after Trump referred to African countries as "shit-holes"?  I know Trump is after Africa's oil rich land, gold and other minerals.

2065 2018-08-29 19:19:00 So far Republican party agenda has been tax cuts for 1% & Corporations,  a gutted ACA, HUD, Social Security and Medicare. Appalling GOP legislators allowed the sell off of American Parks for oil, gas & mineral rights. Shameful unethical behavior of GOP legislators. 0 Patriotism
2066 2018-08-29 19:19:00 BUY PURPLE SHAMPOO AND COCONUT OIL. MY BROTHERS GF BLESCHED MY HAIR ONCE AND SHE BURNT IT AND THOSE PRODUCTS SAVED ME
2067 2018-08-29 19:18:55 Last night's dinner was pasta al pesto with green beans; lunch today was beetroots with olive oil and balsamic vinegar + cottage cheese + walnut bread. #motivationalDiary
2068 2018-08-29 19:18:49 Did I just see an advert for Cannabis Oil on ITV?
2069 2018-08-29 19:18:15 Decided to rename the oil. 

It’s now called 
Rich Glow Oil.
2070 2018-08-29 19:18:06 Venezuela is in melt down due to the oil price plummeting in 2014. If the oil price plummeted, why the f*ck has the price of petrol constantly went up in this country?

2072 2018-08-29 19:17:38 Relieve that swollen brain feeling with hemp oil and cinnamon. 

Naturally go after your everyday inflammation and anxiety.

It's been working extraordinarily well for me.
2073 2018-08-29 19:17:27 SUVs & Pickups are branding big V8s similar to the muscle car era since the 1950s. We haven’t evolved or learned a thing but to maintain the status quo for big oil so you can drive a Hemi Truck like your “Daddy’s Burnt Orange 1970 Charger”. Cmon, be more original than that.

 We know the truth, Nigerian presidency is all about selling oil and lining their pockets with the proceeds.
2076 2018-08-29 19:17:09 Same with ‘big oil’ or ‘big pharma.’ Tag on ‘big’ to any industry and I automatically translate to ‘bad.’

2078 2018-08-29 19:16:50 MCT oil in coffee with heavy cream 2-3 times a day was a huge positive impact
2079 2018-08-29 19:16:47 Grapes must be crushed to make wine. Diamonds form under pressure. Olives are pressed to release oil. Seeds grow in darkness. Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation.
2080 2018-08-29 19:16:47 My seat in chem squeaked every single time I moved so today I brought some bike oil to class and fixed it but everyone was looking at me like I was fucking insane lmao
2081 2018-08-29 19:16:45 Ughhhh. Angry angry tummy. But this is the first time it’s happened in a while so props to CBD oil for getting me this far.
2082 2018-08-29 19:16:28 i thought taking ur car in to get the oil changed was supposed to b casual. theyre saying i need all KINDS of shit done and now i’m driving home ready for my tires to fall off, my engine to explode and my spark plugs to do SOMETHIN

2085 2018-08-29 19:16:06 FFS, deluded fool. Angola was the up and coming economy with huge oil revenue. Now it's in the dumps. South Africa is slowly becoming a failed state. Nigeria is riddled with corruption (and no way will it's population grow 10x) of course it's economy will rise -->

2087 2018-08-29 19:15:58 First of all Corporations, Oil companies, etc. are going to pass taxes on to the consumer and people are paying high enough taxes at the pump and on their heating oil up north. People will not put up with that. Seems like Liberal's solutions to everything is forced 'taxation'.
2088 2018-08-29 19:15:35 if T Boone Pickens found a gold mine undiscovered oil basin, it does NOT last 4ever. & coal & oil DO pollute more than green resources-its JUST a fact-not fake news or alt-fact! LIVE N Ur engine-on car N Ur garage 4 3 hours, & u will c what burns out Ur exhaust pipe will KILL U!
2089 2018-08-29 19:15:24 Linda Duncan got elected in 2008 on ending subsidies to oil sands projects tho soooo..... Given the character of the neighbourhood and the fact that provincially its been an NDP stronghold since the 80’s, i think any tory or Liberal will have an uphill battle there.

2094 2018-08-29 19:14:52 That’s only the Nationalist oil....
2095 2018-08-29 19:14:37 Hydroelectric in Ontario is mostly exhausted Few small sites remain. 60% of Ontario electricity is produced from nuclear. Two fuel pellet plants (Atikokan and T. Bay using Norwegian Fuel). Small wind and solar that need fossil b/u. Nuclear much cheaper than importing coal or oil
2096 2018-08-29 19:14:33 Are these balls sprinkled with oil or wet due to seduction ? 
2097 2018-08-29 19:14:27 I have an idea about the physical part of building treatment programs all through Alaska! Number one we sue big Pharma! For knowingly producing a product like cigarettes they knew were addictive! Number to stop giving corporate welfare to oil/gas! No more subsidies! More taxation
2098 2018-08-29 19:14:13 @HeyHeyItsConrad @tonyschiavone24 If I’m not mistaken, didn’t Konnan’s song say “oil of Olay all day every day”...? @WHWMonday
2099 2018-08-29 19:14:09 It’s because it’s cheap that’s why companies use it so much, they don’t need to use it, I’m sure @cadburysilk would taste just as good without palm oil as would bread  it’s ridiculous
2100 2018-08-29 19:13:51 Aww thanks. I had it shoulder length  before. I miss it. 

It can get dry but mostly dandruff. I've been using sulfate and paraben free stuff and tea tree oil hair dress to help
2101 2018-08-29 19:13:46 has been more & more reliant on imported oil from a DANGEROUS & turbulent Mid East region since the oil embargo days! Prices ROSE! When I was a kid, gas 4 Ur car was much cheaper, even allowing 4 inflation. ONLY from the invention of fracking have we found temporary relief. &even
2102 2018-08-29 19:13:39 excluded oil heater makes you stoned
2103 2018-08-29 19:13:28 Today’s a good day:) had lunch with my mommy, gonna go meet up with friends and got my oil changed in my car
2104 2018-08-29 19:13:03 Hi, @ChickfilA may you please stop using peanut oil for your chicken? I tend to find myself in a lot of situations where your food is served :)
2105 2018-08-29 19:13:00 Where were you when the Assembly passed #SB100? I was at the Escondido farmers market collecting petitions against offshore oil drilling! Ready for the next big campaign win #Get #Hyped

I think there's something different this time. You know, it's gone on way too long...
Yes, have a pint of clove oil helps the rat go down! 
OK I'll be away for a while as I am now cooking/ringing A & E!! 
2108 2018-08-29 19:12:32 Truffle oil. Ugh, it smells like gazoline to me 
2109 2018-08-29 19:12:31 Getting another new tire and my oil changed tomorrow! My car should be good to go for a while now!

2115 2018-08-29 19:11:39 Finally got my oil changed on my car da mechanic said it was much needed
2116 2018-08-29 19:11:38 Unlike Mark Weisbrot - @AJEnglish report on #Venezuela this evening- the Qatari channel failed to mention financial sanctions as the main cause of the hyperinflation gripping that country.Oil prices also drop for other poorer oil countries like Angola.Did not see this suffering?
2117 2018-08-29 19:11:28 When you get a second why not ask your pals on WALL ST. who control the ENERGY COMPLEX at the CCM to cut gas and heating oil prices by 50% and it would still be higher than when they took it over 3 1/2 yrs. ago. NOT OPEC!
2118 2018-08-29 19:11:26 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2119 2018-08-29 19:11:22 Josh took my car to work so I can take his car for an oil change. Ugh

2122 2018-08-29 19:11:10 @atiku Your excellency! Would like to know ow do u intend to diversify Nigerian Economy from our dependent on Oil as mainstay of the economy? Also should PDP as a part pick another candidate what next? Does that mean the ambition and hope is lost for the youths?

2126 2018-08-29 19:10:37 Fastest and easiest way to create reserves, selling oil in new Scots pound not the dollar standard.

Fastest way to grow SOV bank savings, SNSandI, long term bonds not just premium - tax saving like super isas.

Fastest way to a NFP energy company , WRS in planning legs/regs.
2127 2018-08-29 19:10:24 You're so right, I personally like rules & regulations, they keep food & medicine safe, they protect our earth & keep badguys from ruining it with their oil spills & such!
2128 2018-08-29 19:10:13 o padrão sociopata das corporações vem de longe e a infâmia é exponencial ao seu tamanho. Por exemplo: a Standard Oil, dos Rockfellers produzia, através de laranjas, gasolina e borracha para os nazistas. A IBM desenvolveu um sistema para cadastro e otimização da "solução final".
2129 2018-08-29 19:10:12 A vial of oil labelled “Tomonari’s anointmente forr long swordes and other weppons of the disttinguished nobelemann.”
2130 2018-08-29 19:10:04 Endless oil story
2131 2018-08-29 19:09:58 Same as Republican NDN's. They just make me wonder, if they are paying attention. Those oil tycoons who want pipelines everywhere, are not big Dem supporters.
2132 2018-08-29 19:09:54 Coconut oil rub’a dubbed all over my bod
2133 2018-08-29 19:09:52 And Reagan’s ‘Tear down this wall, Mr. Gorbachev’ ... all theatrics. The price of oil - on which Russia’s economy/military was based - had gone from $59 to $17 a barrel. You and I and your Uncle Phil could have torn down the wall without opposition. But GOPers fell for it.
2134 2018-08-29 19:09:51  Though I hear that your favourite biscuits don't have palm oil in them. #result
2135 2018-08-29 19:09:44 Went to get an oil change and shorty deadass was like give us bout to hour
2136 2018-08-29 19:09:38 I hate going to get oil changes, or anything that has to do with the maintenance.
2137 2018-08-29 19:09:35 So I have learned today that Olive Oil gets spiders out of your ears. Who knew? (A few of you did)
2138 2018-08-29 19:09:22 Libya getting hot too. Elections scheduled for the 10th/dec18 on risk. On EM, half of 2018 demand growth is coming from oil exporting countries. 60% of New USD-denominated debt issued by GCC and oil producers/USD savers (GS “The Credit Trader”)
2139 2018-08-29 19:09:22 As I said - ignorance is bliss. I am not interested in debating a person who does not read or research - you have your beliefs, PS and Mexico is not seeking to triple its exports via regulations thus crippling Canada's oil exports =
2140 2018-08-29 19:09:08 Get some oil out and enjoy the fucker fs
2141 2018-08-29 19:08:44 So if cali wants 2 have cleaner air than the south, let em! Dont mock that decent desire, & ACKNOWLEDGE (a word Im using a lot, here) U may just love $ more than they, as its a tradeoff between max oil dollars, or cleaner air, tho technology is bridging the polarities, more &more
2142 2018-08-29 19:08:38 They probably like to take advice from Big Oil agencies like the API instead.
2143 2018-08-29 19:08:35 Yup
2144 2018-08-29 19:08:23 We on the same boat cause I do too, I pay my bills and then set aside money for gas,groceries,etc and then the oil money You do have left over you put it away. It suscks tho cause you gotta give up going out every weekend but after awhile you’ll have extra money
2145 2018-08-29 19:08:19 Don’t tell me dreams don’t come true! Mine just did! I just got hired at Lucas Oil Stadium!!!!! Colts Pro Shop!
2146 2018-08-29 19:08:17 So we pull 20,000+ troops out of South Korea, get the hell out of the middle east oil squabbles, let Russia reunite her USSR countries and I agree, maybe we could put 5% into education, maybe even more...

If only our "bought & paid for" politicians represented THE PEOPLE...
2147 2018-08-29 19:08:12 I saw the menu when I went there. I am just saying there not that many choices compared to other sub shops. Oil and vinegar isn’t for everyone
2148 2018-08-29 19:07:49 Hi @networkrail, my cat returned from her rat patrol of your Hitchin deport soaked in stinking oil today and had to be rushed to the vets. H&S and environmental regulations require waste oil to be kept contained. Could you please ask the depot to check the site?
2149 2018-08-29 19:07:48 Gonna take up oil painting again. I forgot how expensive the paints are T-T
2150 2018-08-29 19:07:47 He probably doesn't want oil and the smell of ass kissing all over him.
2151 2018-08-29 19:06:58 They rust shockingly and it's rare to find one that's anywhere near oil tight. They arguably handle best on 10 inch rims, but later disc-braked cars on 12 inch rims are better on a day-to-day basis. A tuned 1275cc motor, circa 80bhp and 5x12inch wheels is a fun, usable combo.
2152 2018-08-29 19:06:19 Thanks Blair, interesting about canola oil exports, that must have been western wheat, certainly not #Ontario or #Quebec SRW~typically our American friends don’t let trade agreements get in the way of their interests
2153 2018-08-29 19:05:50 I reckon there's more than one mad hatter at their tea party sadly 
I honestly do think this case is heading towards interesting times, will hands be forced? That's the questions.
Fresh? Oh gawd.....Where's that clove oil? 
2154 2018-08-29 19:05:48 Oil is iLife

2156 2018-08-29 19:05:34 I once rented an open plan place with no central heating and just a couple of electric heaters. When I bought an oil filled radiator it made a huge difference to the heat but overall the heating bill was sky high.

2160 2018-08-29 19:05:29 Incredibly brief visit to Manchester to talk to Shell Out! campaigners about how to get oil out of our museums.

2162 2018-08-29 19:05:22 Weren't India running at 8+ GDP during 2013 when crude oil was $150 and In India petrol @ 70.00

Now $50.00, India selling at Rs 80.00 plus but cost of petrol is just Rs 30.00 and moreover trade deficit is widening; fluctuating rupees; low GDP agnst promise ; higher NPA's etc

2164 2018-08-29 19:05:19 My wife’s just pointed out that we’re “boycotting palm oil because of the orangutans”. So that’s cleared that up.
2165 2018-08-29 19:05:11 But I thought the oil was running out? 
2166 2018-08-29 19:05:10 Oil is
2167 2018-08-29 19:05:10 Exactly. The most I will add to my tea is either some lemon or some stevia. At no point have I ever ordered a tea and been like "I want a cup of black tea, infuse it with green tea essence, 3 shots of espresso, 2 tbsp of heavy cream, 1 tbsp coconut oil, then cool it & reheat it.

2175 2018-08-29 19:04:04 The treasury in Kenya is so rogue . It's a good thing the Bill on the petroleum levy failed. So the treasury  literally wanted to gain more revenue by taxing petrol while Kenya is gaining new revenue from the export of newly found oil? What sort of level of greed is that? damning
2176 2018-08-29 19:03:57 My sister in law has neck and dizziness issues and my son has severe psoriatic arthritis. Both were helped by inexpensive hemp seed oil(no CDB or THC content).
11 bucks for 120 pills, a 40 day supply. Doesn’t help every one, but it’s safe and the only side affect is lower B/P

2179 2018-08-29 19:03:28  sorry I’m never on hurrrrrr. But yes au naturel babyyyyyyyyy  Meek I’ve used honey, coconut oil, vitamin E! Trying a coffee scrub & vitamin C serum nexxxxxxtttttt
2180 2018-08-29 19:03:11 Out of work, to go do an oil change 
2181 2018-08-29 19:03:00 The way Manchester United is going down err,they will soon discover oil
2182 2018-08-29 19:02:53 Nah I’m a trooper. But some lavender oil and it and it was fine 
2183 2018-08-29 19:02:51 It was artisan truffle oil mayo too. I told our friend that it would haunt my dreams for weeks.
2184 2018-08-29 19:02:43 Same, would stuff oil soaked rags in a tin and set them on fire, then grab a bottle of water on the end of a 5 foot stick and pour it on the fire, Insta-fireball.
2185 2018-08-29 19:02:43 it was in a report month ago will buy zero oil after November, supply will be from Saudi and Russia.
2186 2018-08-29 19:02:22 I think the fact that we can’t get any resource development done shows only too clearly it’s not an oil deep state but an foreign environmental movement deep state.
2187 2018-08-29 19:02:17 The Joint Study Commission on Low THC Medical Oil Access is now hearing from the Regional Director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition Virginia Galloway #gapol
2188 2018-08-29 19:02:11 Oil me up ??
2189 2018-08-29 19:02:03 Did you not read the post? Heavy oil in a heavy oil refinery gets higher margins, produces more product per barrel and generates less waste. It is better to refine than light crude. Why would you retire equipment that produces higher margins and less waste?

2191 2018-08-29 19:01:53 I've read that if cooking in a crockpot, a little bit of water should be added with the herb and coconut oil, so no scorching will occur. Even if cooking on LOW. I didn't see that in your recipe, which makes me happy! I don't like adding water but didn't wanna ruin my batch!
2192 2018-08-29 19:01:50 Gotta be acrylic cause you never this patient with oil.
2193 2018-08-29 19:01:48 I'm with ya 100% Bill, but this'll keep happening as long as oil companies keep lobbying politicians which will pollute the planet through dirty money. Tell everyone to vote them out and elect those who won't take corporate money and will PROMISE to invest in green technology.

It could be the "War between righteousness & snake oil salesmen", but in any case you can wager that Mr. Tough Guy will be on a golf course.
2206 2018-08-29 19:00:20 In fact, the Venezuelans tried to stop the USA from buying their oil only to find nobody else’s refineries could take it.

2209 2018-08-29 18:59:51 Let it be known that all of the oil removed from the earth will result in the iron ore core overheating. The coolent is gone. We will burst into flames eventually. I said it first.
2210 2018-08-29 18:59:49 you know they got that oil money out there
2211 2018-08-29 18:59:36 but not the largest banks...or oil companies...or coal companies...or gun companies...
2212 2018-08-29 18:59:06 Back when I had really bad acne I used 10% Benzoyl Peroxide cream. And because it dries your skin I used oil free face cream morning noon and night as well as facials for acne and my face cleared up within like 4-6 months
2213 2018-08-29 18:59:03 long story short: the translation in arabic is “poop oil”
2214 2018-08-29 18:58:59 Ah. Please how are you making Ofada/Ayamase without bleaching the palm oil ? If you don’t bleach it isn’t that just palm oil stew? I’m stressed 
2215 2018-08-29 18:58:46 Dip them in oil. You're away....
2216 2018-08-29 18:58:23 This life guide not anoiting oil and praying on the park
2217 2018-08-29 18:58:21 Try shea moisture brand 100%extra virgin coconut oil.
2218 2018-08-29 18:58:19 I'm from Northeast Mississippi and went to USM. However, honestly for any counties north of Forrest/Lamar to get BP oil spill money is a travesty. Why does Jackson or Southaven need money from an oil spill? Oh wait............they don't.
2219 2018-08-29 18:58:17 Why don't you call out the CPC for being a wholly owned subsidiary of the oil industry.
2220 2018-08-29 18:58:10 They're too far away from each other - they're isolated.  How do you get to the grocery store after peak oil if you're 15 miles from the closest strip mall?
2221 2018-08-29 18:58:08 WD40 is my essential oil.
2222 2018-08-29 18:57:56 and also thank god for baby oil.
2223 2018-08-29 18:57:41 Mix cetaphil lotion with rose hip oil. The lotion is completely fragrance free, and the oil will zap the dryness away. I use it every day and it’s PERFECT.
2224 2018-08-29 18:57:20 Gas, diesel, petrol, all are burning holes in people's pocket not because world oil prices are high but because govt has decided to recover the bank losses by imposing one of the highest tax rates on fuel.

2226 2018-08-29 18:57:18 my thoughts exactly-many oil rich South American countries seeking to drop the dollar are constantly invaded and infiltrated under the fiction of Regime Change requested by the People. They end up with US puppet leaders whose job is to destroy their country and drain it
2227 2018-08-29 18:57:02 Just before @theGusMcCree blocked me he replied oil pd for my 'lifestyle'. He had no idea how much. Check out the Lubicon Cree, Gus.

For another, as if we had a choice. Well, we did, but then those choices got squashed pretty damned quickly by your oil overlords.

2255 2018-08-29 18:54:09 You may want to read the Forbes article above. Oil is a finite resource. As the supply of it decreases, it will rise in price. Meanwhile, renewables are decreasing in price each year.  Both trends are forecast to continue by everyone knowledgeable in the industry.

2300 2018-08-29 18:48:11 That’s really interesting that you brought that up actually because their forests are being destroyed for palm oil which is in non vegan foods as well.

2305 2018-08-29 18:47:07 On @TexasStandard today: oil companies pay taxes, so the gov't should pay for coastal infrastructure to protect their assets. Cuz otherwise, it's double taxation. Well citizens pay taxes too. We should pay for their decision to build in a high risk area?

2328 2018-08-29 18:43:43 WOW!  Watching the Doctor testifying at the JSC on Low THC Medical Oil Access.  No one has the time to count the fallacies in his argument. #MedicalMarijuana

2330 2018-08-29 18:43:30 Got a reed diffuser, oil burner, pillow spray, some ‘sleep’ helping tea stuff, sleepy body lotion n the lot in my room. I am fkin determined to sleep normally cos I feel dead

2333 2018-08-29 18:43:17 Try applying olive oil on your scalp for a couple of hours once a week it helps
2334 2018-08-29 18:43:11 I asked my doctor for CBD oil and without missing a beat, he said “I don’t know what that is”. 
2335 2018-08-29 18:42:57 And I needed an oil change 800 miles ago but who’s counting 
2336 2018-08-29 18:42:53 . Data available shows US still imports our oil as at May 2018. Nigeria is equally getting alternatives to US oil market.
2337 2018-08-29 18:42:52 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

2343 2018-08-29 18:42:23 So for me to even be considered for a card to get CBD oil to treat my anxiety I’d have to shell out $250 without the guarantee of getting it and in Dublin it cost me 20 bucks and no GP visit. Screw America man

2357 2018-08-29 18:41:16 Excuse me #Trumpy, but the reason why GDP has increased is because of your tariffs! No one outside the USA will trade with a Traitor and Thief! Your sanctions on Iran are putting oil prices up, not down! Being the wannabe gangster you want to be will go horribly wrong for you!!!
2358 2018-08-29 18:41:08 PMB served as Petroleum minister but he did not get oil company..ask Danjuma, Mr Ben served as only DG of NTA after that He got Silverbird TV, Silver bird cinema..So who is corrupt. Who knows if the cinema was not built on acquired NTA land.

2370 2018-08-29 18:39:56 I lived in Alberta. Unfortunately they're letting rich oil companies cloud their judgement. Its a losing battle they're fighting and they have short-term goals to get rich at any cost. Mindsets are very hard to shift out West. I know, there's no reasoning with them.
2371 2018-08-29 18:39:51 i love the ppl i work w. i went to leave for my lunch break & they were all “don’t forget to get ur oil changed” LIKE OMG I DID FORGET THANKSS

Just wondering.
2374 2018-08-29 18:39:34 The more solar is installed, the better and cheaper it will get. I live in the Southwest United States (specifically Arizona) and have watched big oil slow down research and oppose government policy encouraging renewable energy. Arizona should be a leader in solar, it's not.

2391 2018-08-29 18:37:30 @realDonaldTrump The time of the Indian economy and the economy of any country that violates the sanctions will fall sharply. The oil embargo will be fully implemented and I promise that Iran's oil exports will be completely cut off until November 4th,

2404 2018-08-29 18:36:10 My wife needs to get her oil changed.

2412 2018-08-29 18:35:20 Iraq can reportedly raise its oil exports, according to SOMA, who state that the oil market needs more supply (via @RANsquawk )
2413 2018-08-29 18:35:12 The average for the state is not the highest but that is skewed by the rural areas having cheaper rates.
Then there are utilities electric, heating oil, and water.
Oil prices sky rocket in the winter, summer heat often, and more recently more frequently, has oppressive humidity.

2423 2018-08-29 18:34:09 If the court stops the building of the pipeline it will fully end the Alberta Oil Sands which have been paying Canada's tax bill for years - cut off the oil and you cut off the money supply which pays for the subsidies that fund most of these Native Canadians lives.
2424 2018-08-29 18:34:05 It’s just cooked rice, with a bit of oil to keep it from separating. Yes, rice is easyish to cook - but easy portioning and no tidy up make it a very useful thing.

2437 2018-08-29 18:32:43 Absolutely. Fortunately they had a spare transformer so Rand Water was up and running again. BTW, do you have ANY idea how TOXIC that oil is that you can see leaking from the thing? Contaminated ground water for centuries 
2438 2018-08-29 18:32:43 That's basically the sautéed paleroot. I usually use goblin belly oil to fry them lightly. Not too much of course unless you want them to get that typical goblin taste. You could use carrion crawler blubber too. But I found it a hassle to hunt them.
2439 2018-08-29 18:32:42 One of these days, when the Industrial Hemp Farming Act passes and it’s cultivation becomes mainstream domestically, I hope to see a reduction in price on Hemp Milk, Hemp Seeds and Hemp Seed Oil.

2455 2018-08-29 18:31:00 Why are Nigerians getting poorer by the day under your 'non corrupt' government despite the fact that oil has been selling for over $70 in the last 2 years ?
2456 2018-08-29 18:30:46 Specifics? How about Big Oil, Big Sugar and other corporations that profit off of the pollution of the Gulf. Or Gov.

2457 2018-08-29 18:30:38 going by myself to get an oil change and to get my car inspected.

2463 2018-08-29 18:29:59 Lets talk about real environmental issues like deforestation, GMO, pesticides, factory farm run off, corporations dumping everything into the Oceans and waterways, oil spills. Talk about concrete issues instead of something as vague an controversial as CC/global cooling/warming.
2464 2018-08-29 18:29:54 I’m getting my oil changed and these two dads are in here politely arguing about what’s better, this hot weather or the snow 
2465 2018-08-29 18:29:52 Always spray oil on my body first few days of a holiday & end up so sore  cant bring myself to use suncream
2466 2018-08-29 18:29:49 I swear by coconut oil - cheap and effective!
2467 2018-08-29 18:29:42 Tourism should have been invested in. Including medical and sports tourism. But oil will always be a good revenue source, not in terms of energy supply but to sell to the downstream petrochemical industry.
2468 2018-08-29 18:29:40 I really need to get home a change this oil soaked shirt , or else I’m gonna become chicken cacciatore.
2469 2018-08-29 18:29:36 Over the years, I have learnt to love vegetables. I remember the tough time my mom had trying to get me to eat spinach fried in oil and spices, and here I am chowing down the raw stuff in a salad! 
But one vegetable that I still abhor and cannot bring myself to eat: zucchini!
2470 2018-08-29 18:29:24 do a google of “glory hole in oil exploration. Pretty clear any oil man is familiar
2471 2018-08-29 18:29:15 We do need more taxes. Taxes in Alberta aren't enough to cover healthcare, nevermind anything else. This would be a bigger problem if oil revenues weren't available to fill the gap.   

You're not very bright, are you?

2474 2018-08-29 18:29:00 Well, and oil changes. Lol
2475 2018-08-29 18:28:57 If these idiots think that any EV driver could ever believe this total BS is inconceivable. Guess what EV’ s ate charged 90% of the time at home. So potential for rip Off Oil prices is limited. Wake up !
2476 2018-08-29 18:28:53 the spa I go to regularly offered me a trial massage with cbd oil next time I come in and I’m so excited wtf!!!!!
2477 2018-08-29 18:28:51 I work in a similar field. I have seen the documentaries on the oil field life, what you are saying about the lack of stability is true, but the skillset is in demand. The skillset and money saved is your backup.

2481 2018-08-29 18:28:16 Wait till your 40. Ugh. Lol. Seriously, though, CBD oil is a miracle for pain.
2482 2018-08-29 18:28:12 God bless you
2483 2018-08-29 18:28:11 Try not to use anything with palm oil, trust me on this one if you care about the planet we live on 
2484 2018-08-29 18:27:58 Look like cooling venturis on the oil coolers ? 
2485 2018-08-29 18:27:46 You should flirt back by suggesting chores he can do for you. Like "Are you going to give my car an oil change? teeheehee "
lol
2486 2018-08-29 18:27:35 This new oil I’m wearing smell bomb af
2487 2018-08-29 18:27:27 Euz 
2488 2018-08-29 18:27:26 Nigeria is a totally corrupt country with huge oil. They don't need UK help.
2489 2018-08-29 18:27:19 Money breakdown in America who has it? 1percent has 97 percent of all money. Of the 1percent, 75 percent doctors and attorneys 24 percent of the one percent are sports hero’s and movie stars Etc. And of the last one percent of the one percent that have 93 of all money= OIL MEN!!!
2490 2018-08-29 18:27:12 the very moment I applied oil pain on wood I regretted it. I knew it wasn't the best idea. So now I bough acrylic copper metallic paint. *sighs* I NEED TO STOP SPENDING MONEY
2491 2018-08-29 18:26:49 I have been using castor oil on my eyelashes every night and I see such a difference 
2492 2018-08-29 18:26:48 She’s a snake oil salesman, relentless badgering.
2493 2018-08-29 18:26:26 Try the #PictsweetFarms Roasted Vegetables! I #GotItFree from @bzzagent, but you can buy them for a great price and they’re super easy to make! Just drizzle with oil and seasoning, pop them in the oven, then enjoy! They’re so tasty! #RoastEmUp #LetsRoast
2494 2018-08-29 18:26:14 When you are standing in line at  the grocery and the person in front of you is digging for oil. (Picking their snozola)
2495 2018-08-29 18:26:10 I mean the car was probably fucked to begin with, they break down and Chris and the fully-opened-eyes mother probably don't do basic stuff like change the oil.
2496 2018-08-29 18:26:08 1: We're glad you asked, Luis! Generally, chainsaws are allowed in checked bags. However, if they contain any residue or vapors of gas or oil, they would be considered a hazardous material and prohibited from being transported.
2497 2018-08-29 18:26:05 I hope they still have fries. (Though I shiver at the thought of what oil they are made in.)
2498 2018-08-29 18:25:59 Pastinya mau nyari yg ringan & mudah meresap kan? Sama kyk aku, pke Cosrx Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion. Ringan & melembabkn aplg buat km yg oily~
2499 2018-08-29 18:25:57 Dairy and soup? Oil and water is a more compatible combo lol
2500 2018-08-29 18:25:56 Barnier is talking about an unprecedentedly close relationship, one should never forget he is negotiating for Europe not us, he may have all the charm of a snake oil salesman but we should not forget his aim is to sell us a deal that is good for Europe not us. #BrexitShambles
2501 2018-08-29 18:25:42 So that was why you bought cap and gave them to avert what you just said,I see how intelligent you are

2503 2018-08-29 18:25:35 Yes, they already send a lot by zípfiles and barrels down Eufrat. 

Assads never shared oil with Syrians apart from the Baathistas and friends. 

You probatly also say, that an inland like that cant exist. Steal oil how?  Ballons with hot air from Your behind??
2504 2018-08-29 18:25:26 At mr bubbles getting the car washed for the year. Also go my oil changed too. #newcarsmell
2505 2018-08-29 18:25:14 Suck a coin and lubricate the nostrils with cream or oil.
Additionally, pray to Allah, as God is too weak to help you in those realms.
2506 2018-08-29 18:25:13 @WhySharksMatter given that shark finning is up there with oil in regards to economics in China. What would happen to the Chinese economy, and the worlds economy for the matter if shark finning was outlawed world wide?
2507 2018-08-29 18:25:12 Peppermint oil, potpourri, and medical supplies and then drive home like nothing was up
2508 2018-08-29 18:25:00 Sarah Jessica Parker: uses disposable toilet seat covers to blot the oil off her face.
2509 2018-08-29 18:24:35 How do I work at a damn dealership but put off getting an oil change. 
2510 2018-08-29 18:24:32 I prefer my babies rolled in breadcrumbs, drizzled with garlic oil and lightly fried.
2511 2018-08-29 18:24:32 3 step plan to save the world:

1.  Build a giant blender.
2.  Round up Trump, Trump’s cabinet, Oil Executives.
3.  Shovel things from step 2 into blender.        

Also could be used as the plot for a Captain Planet movie.
2512 2018-08-29 18:24:19 Clove oil works wonders. Get at a health food store.
2513 2018-08-29 18:24:11 Neither of those are benefits of a SWF they're problems associated with oil wealth that the UK didn't have.
2514 2018-08-29 18:24:01 Because they are made of smoke and daydreams. 
Leave voters are continuing to be played by liars, toadies, incompetents and snake oil sellers. 
Wake up and save us all from this hideously wasteful nightmare!
2515 2018-08-29 18:24:00 Where is all the oil money? Even today , they have shitload of oil making shitloads of money. Where is it?
2516 2018-08-29 18:23:53 Ohh good luck. Vaseline or coconut oil?
2517 2018-08-29 18:23:53 Wallahi su ke kai Ganduje su baro,ordinarily that man knows what he's doing ,I spoke to him some months ago but those that are supposed to advice him end up I'll advising him
2518 2018-08-29 18:23:50 Firstly have nothing to do with with Oil Companies who want to milk the EV charging network to prop up their cancerous toxic industry. Or indeed just help to close down the EV network.
2519 2018-08-29 18:23:47 Is the red tide caused by past oil spills and other pollution? Is that how they grow the “special” algae for fuel?
2520 2018-08-29 18:23:44 Number one cause of Amazon deforestation is meat.  Palm Oil causes major deforestation as well.  Every time you shop you can choose to save the planet.  Go palm oil free #vegan, it’s easy and healthier!  We have a choice here, it’s way past time we started talking about that.
2521 2018-08-29 18:23:41 Britaina Christian Nation. Tens of thousands of Christians have died in Nigeria since 2015 till date. The @UKParliament & @theresa_may are not concerned about the death of these innocent people rather they’re only interested in the oil, why dis wickedness?@nlitvin @realFFK
2522 2018-08-29 18:23:40 I'm not seeing a pic of #DickCheney included here. How many innocent Syrian people have died at the hands of treasonous individuals attempting to use Syria to build a pipeline? War for oil, war for profit, MURDER FOR PROFIT! McCain admitted he made mistakes, is murder a mistake?
2523 2018-08-29 18:23:32 He forgot to mention that in the future kenya will be a huge oil producer and the USA will use our so called #KenyaUSrelations to tear the country apart...trust me Trump can only be good to you if he sees potential in you
2524 2018-08-29 18:23:29 Except China holds a sizeable portion of our debt. They could weaponize that or part of it in retaliation, even if it slightly hurts them too. Or become more belligerant around disputed south China Sea islands because of the oil there. Threaten to "reunify" Taiwan. Etc.
2525 2018-08-29 18:23:24 I'm in charge now: let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Donald Jr.. We won't even miss it!
2526 2018-08-29 18:23:24 ....think mcap is too high for a multi bagger ....diluted to buggery
2527 2018-08-29 18:23:19 It's like every product for oil control has salicylic acid
2528 2018-08-29 18:23:10 Seems like u are the one brainwashed cz Donald Trump speaks abwt expropriation and the rand falls, who is he in our land dat when we speak as the poor we become more poorer? They must come and kill us as they usually do for oil we are prepared to die.
2529 2018-08-29 18:23:09 Dragon Time essential oil is amazeballs

2532 2018-08-29 18:22:55 $xle they will take oil down for labor day weekend and then up for hurricane season.
2533 2018-08-29 18:22:47 sir ye anker nahi dala h modi ka talve chatne wala ye farari to kya plane bhi khird sakta h kyo ki oil ki jo loot machi h wo sab janta ke pase bikau media ya roadshow ya rally me ja rahe h
2534 2018-08-29 18:22:37 The BC gov sues the drug companies for opioid crisis, blame the oil companies for wildfires, tankers for the loss of orcas, salmon farmers for the loss of wild salmon at what point do they rather than place blame take ownership and solve some of these issues.
2535 2018-08-29 18:22:37 TRUTH and TRUMP are inconsistent. Like oil and water. They are enemies.

2536 2018-08-29 18:22:34 I got curious about the pads when I saw it on your Ig story. Now the oil really does wonders! Holy grail!
2537 2018-08-29 18:22:27 oh you just let us for $7mil and there be maaaad oil there 
2538 2018-08-29 18:22:26 You know summer is ending in LA when your coconut oil isn’t fully liquid anymore!!!
2539 2018-08-29 18:22:11 I agree 100% with this but if we turn the tap off or increase our prices on the lumber. We manufacture finished lumber at a fraction of the USA ability.
On the oil I will bet that China would build refineries in Canada and wait the 40 to 50 years for return on their investment.
2540 2018-08-29 18:22:11 Tbs yg tea tree oil. Belom perna coba sih tapi bagus. tapi kalau w pakainya wardah yg witch hazel! Enak,murse dan melembabkan
2541 2018-08-29 18:21:59 even now every day the devil put oil on the earth  when god said it could be paved in gold that was stolen
2542 2018-08-29 18:21:56 Suck it up, Tuppence. Two words: Merrick. Garland. The people will not stand for this and you GOP snake oil salesmen any more. We are done being nice and showing throat and we will destroy you in the voting booth 11-6-2018. #BlueWave
2543 2018-08-29 18:21:34 @JayzTwoCents if you ever decide to rework your d-frame build (not that it’s not awesome) you should try to incorporate different automotive parts ie. oil catch cans, fuel filters, surge tanks, etc. you could even do it for the skunkworks rework.
2544 2018-08-29 18:21:20 You are misinformed,  Japan feels threatened by China and should.  Look at what is happening with the Philippines and China! Philippines finds oil on one of their islands and China tries to claim it.  That is a threat.

2547 2018-08-29 18:20:44 anyone available to drown me in a 5 gallon bucket of cbd oil? this is an unpaid gig but you can keep the cbd, should be worth about 44k
2548 2018-08-29 18:20:39 Come change my oil
2549 2018-08-29 18:20:38 Yho, castor oil then
2550 2018-08-29 18:20:14 I sure was...ha! I did this over the weekend, and I still smell like coconut oil lol

You never know, man...if anything can do it - it's coco oil
2551 2018-08-29 18:20:07 I love how they sell CBD oil. But look down on cannabis users. lol ok.
2552 2018-08-29 18:20:06 With coriander and olive oil over chicken, it's pretty unbeatable. Good on pork, too.
2553 2018-08-29 18:19:56 #ukog May be overlooked by some the affect that oil price will have  on revenue but imagine having a business that sell 1 million parts for $1 the next day the value is $2 now that is a significant mark up last time this share was 10p oil price was $40-50 its now near $77!!!
2554 2018-08-29 18:19:50 I changed the carburetor on my car once. Yes I am that old. Changing oil? Done that. No need to again. By the way Tesla ruins me. I can’t stand driving Toyota’s anymore.
2555 2018-08-29 18:19:44 I certainly hope that fat oil gets a taste of his own medicine, truly truly vile specimen
2556 2018-08-29 18:19:28 It’s all a matter of POV she point some fact and people saw it like some attack, and when people add oil on the fire it’s become an attack and all these shit. 
People should really see thing with peace and some issues like this wouldn’t happend
2557 2018-08-29 18:19:17 Oh in that case. Throw some extra coconut oil or almond oil in your coffee or on your food. It should help with satiety.
2558 2018-08-29 18:19:14 This is beach weather. Where’s the coconut oil  and I should be playing hooky
2559 2018-08-29 18:19:13 Hmm , dictator needs private army - and in an oil producing nation too , who would have thunk it.
2560 2018-08-29 18:19:02 to the mechanics who give me shit for not getting my oil change on time; MAYBE I WOULD GET IT DONE ON TIME IF YOU DIDNT 10/10 JUDGE ME EVERYTIME I COME IN AND TELL ME EVERYTHING WRONG WITH MY 15 YEAR OLD CAR
2561 2018-08-29 18:18:59 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2562 2018-08-29 18:18:40 I have been spreading baking soda and vegetable oil mixed with water. It prevents from blight. You do that every week.
2563 2018-08-29 18:18:10 I actually never got to try the Witch Hazel Pads because of my dry skin! But shucks, I do love the V&M Oil 
2564 2018-08-29 18:18:09 Utterly disgusting to see Venezuelans flee in droves from their country that has the largest oil reserves. What depravity, corruption and mismanagement can cause this? The young are leaving. Can the country cope with only the old?
2565 2018-08-29 18:18:09 @LBC Michael Gove is an absolute disgrace, considering his father was a wealthy Fish Merchant in Aberdeen.  That was when Aberdeen actually had a fishing industry.  Before the EU and, to be fair, before North Sea Oil. But the rest of NE Scotland fishing has been totally let down.
2566 2018-08-29 18:18:01 I love simple sauteed zucchini with a little garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper.
2567 2018-08-29 18:17:59 Givn that that the EPA's Wheeler serves @ the pleasure of our current President, is it any surprise this newest bill is wrought with subversion? 
Trump is pro Oil/anti enviroment thus ~ so is Wheeler.
2568 2018-08-29 18:17:53 He also synthesised Ebola, collided with the oil companies to melt the planet.

What is your views on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Motherson sumi Systems & Ashok Leyland? Can these shares be purchased at current levels and I want to hold for 1 year. Kindly suggest me. 
Thank you,

2577 2018-08-29 18:16:23 I had a similar thing once with a retirement program run by one of the Oil Companies. My rate for teaching a "new skill set" was "bellow the norm". So they upped it. Worst three weeks ever. He was a nightmare.
2578 2018-08-29 18:16:17 ₹ is weak coz oil prices have increased globally and there a trade war going on…
Who said GDP has decreased?
2579 2018-08-29 18:16:08 Random black guy: aye man You got that pontiac SHINING! What you washed it with, baby oil?

Me: hahaha! Preciaate that man forea---

random black guy: aye you got a cigarette?

I hate how my people always tryna fast talk people lol.
2580 2018-08-29 18:16:08 Oil is really not bahrain specific so depends on global output. Financial difficulty are the government finances not the economy. In a few years we will look back and those who understand what happened will be saying a big thank you..
2581 2018-08-29 18:16:07 We sell raw oil that USA refines, sells back to us making profit at our expense. Same holds true for lumber, water et al, we sell & buy back at inflated prices. 

Need to turn our natural resources into finished goods to sell all over the world. US always our nearest big market.
2582 2018-08-29 18:15:59 i put coconut oil in my hair and my hair look so healthy 
2583 2018-08-29 18:15:57 Most are now, sadly deteriorated. 

They were made to be operated with whale oil on the bushings, and using them dry for a time means most are now merely decorative.
2584 2018-08-29 18:15:53 Procrastinating to get an oil change really pays off lol now I don’t have to pay for it, and he made the appointment for me!  #Spoiled
2585 2018-08-29 18:15:51 This Davido’s aza video showcased again the plight of the Niger delta people . sigh the living standard in the villages where the crude oil is drilled from are very bad. Nigeria take from the poor and feed the rich.

2588 2018-08-29 18:15:29 There is a nail in my tire. The oil change people are probably asking who let me own a car. This is what happens when I don’t go home for my dad to baby me.

2590 2018-08-29 18:15:18 Just wash it at one of those self serve stations and forget to turn the hose off.
2591 2018-08-29 18:15:17 If you don’t want to smoke I’d suggest maybe the thc oil. Mine got so bad that I kept going to the hospital because I thought I was having heart attacks. To be honest weed is the one thing that really helps me. It allows me to see past my temporary problems

2600 2018-08-29 18:14:20 Pipelines will not reduce rail. These are different products. Irving Oil said at the Neb that theres no plans to reduce whats shipped. This is a false argument. Industry wants both.

2604 2018-08-29 18:13:44 Literary analysis mode: ON -- Okay, this picture isn't actually a commentary on the prevalence of pumpkin spice marketing, but a commentary on the president. Like motor oil, he is slimy. Like ground beef, he is bloody, and his days are numbered...
2605 2018-08-29 18:13:33 I'll check the oil and see if we can't get that back up for you!

2611 2018-08-29 18:12:17 The US sees a country like Venezuela that is going through an economic crisis due to falling oil prices and government mistakes and what does it do? Does it offer economic and humanitarian aid? No it places economic sanctions on them and sends in the CIA to subvert any progress!

kerosene has a maximum distillation point of 400F

No1,, 2 and 4 distillate fuel oil can only have a maximum of 10% material below 400F

From experience refiners won’t want to do that if they can get better for kerosene

2620 2018-08-29 18:10:48 I sat in a box for an Oil Kings game and it was louder than a Oiler game close to ice level row 15 or up higher.

2622 2018-08-29 18:10:40 Would you be questioning this if she worked on an oil rig? She has a perfectly legitimate career and is providing for her children. Please don't try to make her or similar mums feel guilty about this.
2623 2018-08-29 18:10:33 Am I the only girl who buys oil blotting sheets, NEVER uses them, but some how loses them at the exact moment I need them?
2624 2018-08-29 18:10:27 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

2629 2018-08-29 18:09:31 The 'dry valleys' are ice free and full of resources. Also oil drilling off the coast is nuts but feasible. I think it's more the risk of polar bear attacks stopping them
2630 2018-08-29 18:09:20 Evening Janice, today, I had a bottle of Omega 3 pills thrown at me...
Luckily, I escaped with just Super Fish Oil injuries.
2631 2018-08-29 18:09:13 He backed out last minute.   I smell a chicken.     Open borders and higher taxes aren't a great plan for Texas.  Our economy is just getting going from Obama killing the oil business.   No Beto.

2637 2018-08-29 18:08:32 There are a few important markets that  the USA can’t fully supply themselves two examples oil and lumber. Also if nafta dyes so does there discounted oil prices.
2638 2018-08-29 18:08:30 Tomorrow @olly_richards and I go to @SohoHouse Amsterdam for 2 days. So far we’ve booked a restaurant that used to be an oil rig, a restaurant you have to get a boat to and karaoke. If you’re looking for a pair of absolute heroes, we’re right here.
2639 2018-08-29 18:08:29 You gotta sautee the seasonings first, then add them. Fry up your spices and onions in a little oil before you throw everything in. Even just toasting them in a dry pan works!

2643 2018-08-29 18:08:11 The marmalade over-jelled and didn't fill even half of the jars I sterilized. Woe. I had such visions of being a fairy godmother handing out gleaming jewels of delicious fruity spead. Instead, I'll have to mix it with oil and glaze a roast with it. Woe?

> India 'imports' oil, machinery, technology, etc in US Dollars. So the more we can get in 1$, the better we are.
> But that doesn't mean that if 1$= 1Rs, we'll become powerful..

2669 2018-08-29 18:05:17 Here's the reality.  Oil industry knows heavy, expensive oilsands will be next to fail after coal. They're keen to rip and ship as much as they can before declaring bankruptcy and leaving us their tailing ponds to clean up.

2681 2018-08-29 18:04:10 Also invest in oils, bio oil, cell tone tissue oil or any afforded to u and always have it, use it wit what ever lotion u use and some blues seal Vaseline petroleum jelly will also help
2682 2018-08-29 18:04:08 Another way to consider it would be, why do we call looting a "protest"?  And why do people loot in these poor communities?  Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich. - Proverbs 21:17

Why does Chinese paper oil open the window when oil can (allegedly) just buy Yuan on FX and use it to take all the SGEI's cheap gold? I still don't get what Chinese paper oil is good for.

2693 2018-08-29 18:02:59 Yes, exactly. If Alberta is unwilling to build refineries for their bitumen it's an insane fantasy to think other countries will when they have cheaper, cleaner options. Canadians shouldn't be forced to pay for refineries though.  If it's so profitable, oil industry would do it.
2694 2018-08-29 18:02:48 Come change my oil! Rip

2700 2018-08-29 18:02:04 Ok. I will keep that in mind. I think I used vegetable oil and threw them in the fryer about 15 years ago. I was frying fish also and it was delicious. But the chicken was a different story. Lol.

2726 2018-08-29 18:00:22 I am not sure if wars in sovereign countries in the middle east around oil and opium fields could be called 'fight for America'  rather than hypocrisy.
2727 2018-08-29 18:00:15 Ok real talk... Does anyone’s oil light in their car really work.......
2728 2018-08-29 18:00:15 It’s oil paint 
2729 2018-08-29 18:00:15 When you open a small brown bottle expecting it to be tea tree oil, give it a big 'ol sniff and it turns out to be poppers. Good times.

2731 2018-08-29 18:00:13 Actually, IMF even had oil indicators as positive. What about the financial difficulties that the gov is going through and the GCC states stepping in!

2733 2018-08-29 18:00:07 I sued several auto repair and sales companies this week for spilling oil that threatens the Anacostia River and the health and safety of #DC residents. 

These oil spills contain dangerous carcinogens and chemicals that can kill plants and animals.

2738 2018-08-29 17:59:44 @TSA hey, serious question, can I travel with CBD oil? can you point me to the rules/regulations
2739 2018-08-29 17:59:36 I know of place around dubois oil based actually ..
2740 2018-08-29 17:59:21 Absolutely. And we tried to convey that amid this crisis, many veterans aren't happy with evidence-based therapies, and are therefore somewhat vulnerable to snake oil promise.
2741 2018-08-29 17:59:15 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. 3/4

2743 2018-08-29 17:59:12 Rainy weather put me in the mood for sum oil

2746 2018-08-29 17:58:58 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
2747 2018-08-29 17:58:50 Major flashbacks right now. But more important than MJ dying was an oft-forgot, ill-timed, and foreboding event, which was Bob Inglis losing primary in SC to Trey Gowdy. Tea Party wave starting in SC + oil spill = freaked out Graham.
2748 2018-08-29 17:58:43 I think it should go without saying,this gov'ts economic handling has been extremely poor despite the fact they were provided with the bonanza of cheap crude oil prices in 2014 which now is sky rocketing #DemonetisationScam
2749 2018-08-29 17:58:30 I've been dying to try V&M's Witch Hazel Toner & CPC+G oil you pushed me to buy those after seeing your Ig Story/Ig post. Oh may I add the Thayers Witch Hazel Pads as well 
2750 2018-08-29 17:58:28 I've just signed a petition calling on big companies to stop using palm oil from rainforest destroyers, and you can add your name too! Palm oil is an ingredient used in almost half the products we buy in our supermarkets. Save the orangutans Sign the petition!
2751 2018-08-29 17:58:13 they b like we're better than the rest of you we have oil 
2752 2018-08-29 17:57:57 Welp , this day is just fucking rainbows and unicorns isn’t it ? First some scumbag steals my knife, now some clueless idiot forgot to put a cap back on the oil and it spilled all over my shirt so now I’m drenched in oil . This day can go fuck itself and back again. I’m done
2753 2018-08-29 17:57:48 Any new car instead of a used one.  It still uses the most energy to make something new from what I’ve heard.
2754 2018-08-29 17:57:37 With the crude oil coming from the Niger Republic, where do want it Asaba?
2755 2018-08-29 17:57:35 you can't change the oil yourself???  Add it to your list of things to learn! :-)
2756 2018-08-29 17:57:26 You’re suppose to use it as a sealant not grease for your hair .... like use all your moisturizing products and shit then top of off w / coconut oil
2757 2018-08-29 17:57:25 The magical oil supplies in the Clyde should cover it no bother
2758 2018-08-29 17:57:16 Yeah it’s like filled with beans or something & has lavender essential oil. You put it in the microwave and it stay really warm for a while.

2762 2018-08-29 17:56:50 This is why you either bacon wrapped them or oven baked them with olive oil
2763 2018-08-29 17:56:46 Heard sex is good but have you eaten roasted plantain and palm oil .... ahh mouff
2764 2018-08-29 17:56:42 Don’t look back. Clues of a difficult time ahead are showing. Consumer spending is down, home sales are down and the import of oil is about to take an upturn. I think you better run while you are able.
2765 2018-08-29 17:56:38 Actually I have an oil furnace which I changed about 5? years ago. First of all it's a lot cheaper than gas is now with delivery charges etc. it costs me about $1000 per year for heat. I grew to really hate Enbridge when I had an industrial shop.
2766 2018-08-29 17:56:21 I give up on you, you are beyond redemption.

2775 2018-08-29 17:55:21 There is so much turmoil in Washington, it is going to take a good lawyer to straighten it out.  Trump has eliminated all science and research personnel who guaranteed that we would lead the world...all for profits to oil & gas.

If Canadians nix this out of spite for US or Trump it is full on trade war - full tariffs on everything from Canada including cars & oil
2779 2018-08-29 17:54:58 Fact:  I cannot change oil on semis without it lookin like the Exxon Valdez ran aground on the shop floor.
2780 2018-08-29 17:54:46 He looks awfully spiffy for a socialist - sure he isn’t selling snake oil?
2781 2018-08-29 17:54:40 Stoll spoke at my graduation.  His book at the time was "Silicon Snake Oil," which made some howlingly wrong predictions about the future of the Internet.

But I do think of that book sometimes when I see the disconnection between humans modern social media has bred.
2782 2018-08-29 17:54:29 Oven dry them. Lowest heat, a little sugar and salt. Store in olive oil.
2783 2018-08-29 17:54:26 I need a oil change and a new job and new money fuck it I need everything new

2790 2018-08-29 17:53:33 The Americans are going to invade your forehead if they hear about all that oil.
2791 2018-08-29 17:53:30 Friends who spend the night look across the valley and ask about the fires. I then have to give a minisplainer on the oil biz.
2792 2018-08-29 17:53:29 Every process operated by an organization contributes to its mission & success. In that sense there are no '#IT' processes.

2800 2018-08-29 17:52:33 Yes, climate change is real. It is difficult to get scientist to agree on anything especially something as complex as climate change but all reputable scientists do agree on it.

2864 2018-08-29 17:44:12 You know from your research, lots of bad/terrible/fake Olive Oil. Once people try the real stuff it’s like tap water vs Champagne. Night and day.
2865 2018-08-29 17:44:12 Because they don't want us to know he discovered the secrets of free energy a century ago and our dependency on oil and gas is a total sham.

2872 2018-08-29 17:43:15 @WyrmwoodGaming Just got my new Black Walnut dice vault (Looks amazing BTW) and I was wondering if there's anything I should do to maintain it? I've got a beeswax/mineral oil mix that I've used on other pieces after they get a little beat up. would that be fine for this as well?
2873 2018-08-29 17:43:14 Sounds like disinformation to me.  It seems like if you were really in the pay of big coal you'd be all over promoting EVs and Tesla since they would drive up demand for power plants and coal whereas big oil would be pushing ICEs
2874 2018-08-29 17:43:13 There are oil slicks all over my apartment complex and walking around is like a Mario kart game I keep slipping dude
2875 2018-08-29 17:43:12 you have time girl. Lol. You still took the time to heat the oil and pop that corn...

2888 2018-08-29 17:42:24 @realDonaldTrump Want to make America even Greater, run all cars on Natural Gas, sell all the oil read wall street journal on how we are burning natural gas and wasting millions of dollars in revenue every day due to lack of storage
2889 2018-08-29 17:42:22 Meanwhile we still buy the oil
2890 2018-08-29 17:42:19 Agency Chef: How would you like to season the steaks?

2893 2018-08-29 17:41:38 okay I have a plan.  

but in involves a long pole, a plastic clear box, and lavender oil
2894 2018-08-29 17:41:37 Ryan and I went out to get pizza a few weeks ago, and I asked our waitress for garlic butter. Instead she gave me a cup of olive oil. I still don’t know how to feel about it.
2895 2018-08-29 17:41:37 Skin is acting up. I’ve washed and use jojoba oil but it still stings a lot. Obviously the only thing that can help is kisses everywhere
2896 2018-08-29 17:41:36 Libs preached for decades that "big oil" is all powerful and untouchable which is BS as it is the most over regulated part of the economy. On the other hand, #BigSugar & the Lumber industry are untouchable.  You screw with them & you will be dealt with!
2897 2018-08-29 17:41:36 I wonder if my glasses are always dirty because my body radiates so much figgin heat it's just foggin' it up all the time, combined with the fact my face seems to make enough oil for me to be a member of OPEC, resulting in an inability ever see anything ever
2898 2018-08-29 17:41:34 Thanks guys, I'll put some oil on my hips & knees, see if that clears it up

2901 2018-08-29 17:41:32 WTF 
the U.S. officials had demanded the withdrawal of Iranian forces from southern Syria and data on "terrorist groups", including foreign fighters, and had also requested a role in the oil business in eastern Syria
2902 2018-08-29 17:41:20 That had happened to me too: I had put the fry pan to warm the oil for the potatoes, I dozed off on the couch and thankfully my dog started barking when she smelled the oil burning  since then,when i cook and I’m tired,I put the alarm clock on my mobile

2904 2018-08-29 17:40:58 We also need the Saudis to only sell their oil in u. S. Dollars so that the US dollar can remain the world's Reserve currency and we can artificially inflate our power compared to our so-called free market competitors
2905 2018-08-29 17:40:52 Very little about our relationship with God depends on our knowledge, wisdom or understanding. It is more to do with us being aware, being present, and being receptive.

2906 2018-08-29 17:40:48 Gains are everywhere right now - especially #Tech and #Cannabis - eventually oil had to spike and when it does American independents will go to moon - the play is $WLL in my opinion. Always diversify Always bank gains - #2eZ
2907 2018-08-29 17:40:47 flour, yeast, sugar, coconut oil...? Not sure about the rest but whole foods used to make the best ones
2908 2018-08-29 17:40:40 One thing i hate by a PWI is the students here stank, if i went to HBCU i would be smellin cocoa butter, and coconut oil with a hint of vanilla 
2909 2018-08-29 17:40:37 Surrounded by intimidating palm oil trees, within the vastness of the darkness that sustains it. How long can one truly survive, almost isolated from the comforts of modernity and the carefree urban delusions.

2912 2018-08-29 17:40:23 I’m assuming that no other industries, in the history of Canada, has ever lobbied the government.  Oil?  Auto? Mining? Gun? Given the NAFTA talks, this doesn’t seem surprising, except to the NP pundits who have been shouting the evils of supply mgt forever.

2920 2018-08-29 17:39:54 In other terms.

Middle class is freedom.  Freedom to choose to buy or not to buy.  But you have to put the time in to get your check.

Globalism requires total dependency on the gov. 

Look at Venezuela.  Omce prosperous countey with massive oil potential... overnight crashed
2921 2018-08-29 17:39:26 ING Bank 1/2: #France: We currently expect a weak rebound of GDP in the 3rd quarter. On investment front, with high capacity utilisation & a high level of order books, we remain optimistic for 2018 but household spending will take more time to recover &adjust to higher oil prices
2922 2018-08-29 17:39:23 They smell like cooking oil and coffee to me
2923 2018-08-29 17:39:22 I used to love the sun and we were dangerously stupid when we were young, pouring baby oil all over ya and literally *cooking our skin  I’d give anything to take that back. I don’t even let the sun touch mu face anymore, and my body is heavily blocked. It’s not worth it.

2927 2018-08-29 17:38:57 She wants to send the oil field to Colorado and invest in clean energy... Good luck getting elected on that platform! We need people who will support the actual working class of New Mexico and not just the Northern NM agenda! Vote NO to @RepLujanGrisham we deserve better!
2928 2018-08-29 17:38:51 making sure the company you buy palm oil from is sustainable.. is good idea

2962 2018-08-29 17:34:39 To have a truly informed opinion on EVs, you have to get out & kick tires & try them. Then we can have a meaningful conversation.

2973 2018-08-29 17:33:23 @VinnieTortorich Wondering about the stuffed olives at the grocery store “buffet bar” are ok/not ok sitting in that mystery oil? Could they or the oil cause inflammation?
2974 2018-08-29 17:33:14 Today, coffee is the second largest commodity traded on a global scale!
Only oil exceeds the amount of coffee that is traded in the world today. 400 billion cups of coffee are consumed every year. It’s very likely that coffee consumption will continue for a long, long time.
2975 2018-08-29 17:33:12 The Iraqi official is on the wires saying:
OPEC should discuss how to make up for dropping Iranian oil supply
 Oil market will face a supply shortage post Iran  sanctions
OPEC to discuss in December whether producers  can compensate for a sudden drop in Iranian oil supply
2976 2018-08-29 17:33:09 The cannister has increased oil volume and greater cooling capacity so the shocks can take more abuse

2988 2018-08-29 17:32:03 What oil money??

2990 2018-08-29 17:31:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms! Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2991 2018-08-29 17:31:37 Last I heard the Dorset wreckers, the Sea Pirates wrecked Torrey Canyon spread oil all over SW England and then set about sinking a French Ship, stealing all the contents on Dorset mud Pity they did not sink into the oil quicksand and muds full of lizard parts Maritime officers?!
2992 2018-08-29 17:31:34 I’d recommend CBD oil. I’ve been using @NaturesUltra CBD oil for 6 months for better overall health. I’ve noticed a lot of good effects so far. Good luck

3144 2018-08-29 17:17:56 This is such a ridiculous argument. The increase in tanker movements is mitigated by the decrease in US tankers (from oil transported to Puget Sound via pipeline) and is dwarfed by the increase in large ship movements associated with the Ports of Vancouver and Seattle.

3280 2018-08-29 17:01:57 #FunFact: During the 12 days of the @mnstatefair we go through roughly 400,000 Lbs of potatoes, 25,000 Lbs of @HeinzKetchup_US, and 3000 Gallons of oil!
3281 2018-08-29 17:01:50 And now that we have oil

3283 2018-08-29 17:01:26 Many dont know, that all 11 of the remaining disciples (Judas being #12) were murdered whilst spreading the gospel. They were beaten, stabbed, stoned, crucified, burned, thrown into hot oil, all sorts of things. That was the highest level of persecution, and still the embraced it
3284 2018-08-29 17:01:23 ok so i’ve been procrastinating an oil change for oh idk like 13,000 miles now. and i reallyyyy don’t want to get a lecture about it, so i keep procrastinating it and i hate myself lol

3286 2018-08-29 17:01:19 Rose hip oil worked like a charm! Thank you! (It’s been so long since I’ve work makeup regularly that I forgot about oil. Used to be mandatory for early aughts no smudge lipstick and eyeliner.)
3287 2018-08-29 17:01:19 It’s actually oil
3288 2018-08-29 17:01:14 some cook food really unhealthy though, esp from most of these cook shops. A lot of oil is used
3289 2018-08-29 17:01:12 Just sharing but I smell wonderful today. Wanna know why? Cause I’ve doused myself in eucalyptus and lavender oil to ease both my sinus and tension headaches!

3295 2018-08-29 17:00:45 Mine is patchy, but improving. Beard oil and beard balm have made a massive difference.

3301 2018-08-29 17:00:22 Holly, how do I get oil to oil up the wheels of the communist donkey. I haven't gotten bodies delivered in weeks now, and there's still a long time until I can produce oil.
3302 2018-08-29 17:00:21 Happy Birthday to my G, my big dawg, & my one&only best friend @PMWbxtch  enjoy your day, don’t drink to much of that oil & don’t shoot the club up 
3303 2018-08-29 17:00:15 It’s actually a different recipe, the vinegar oil isn’t the best one.
The good shit is olive oil and lemon juice, with a pinch of salt.
I recommend using large pieces of broccoli because the small stuff just gets soggy

3306 2018-08-29 16:59:59 Jimat oil and salt ayu. It's not cheap anymore
3307 2018-08-29 16:59:47 I’m sad that a lot of our fav beauty products growing up were filled with mad petroleum and mineral oil. 

But the red fox cocoa butter in the yellow container??? A $2.99 must have
3308 2018-08-29 16:59:47 
3309 2018-08-29 16:58:54 Hey Tex: the beard oil is more masculine. The face oil is light, fresh, clean, and doesn’t stay around for long. The beard oil also contains Juniper, vetiver, teatree, and clove leave, which are not in the face oil. It’s definitely stronger.
3310 2018-08-29 16:58:53 Hit the KOA, got my oil changed, nails & toes done.. and it’s not even 12 yet!
3311 2018-08-29 16:58:51 Do you understand that on a keto diet, you can eat nutrient dense protein (meat), high quality fat (olive oil, avocado), and green vegetables and berries? What good group is missing? The soy food group? The bean food group? The banana food group? The corn and wheat food group?
3312 2018-08-29 16:58:37 I never knew it was so much to a car. I literally thought it was just oil change and fill tank up. No one told me about: rotating tires, tire pressure, fluids, brakes, and tune ups 
3313 2018-08-29 16:58:35 It had an oil leak! But it’s fixed now 
3314 2018-08-29 16:58:07 Y’all sit there with all that chicken oil on y’all legs in this heat ... y’all gone right cry walking to class
3315 2018-08-29 16:58:03 beauty product tweet: i tried out a few face oil samples but they all smell like rose, which i hate, so i was excited to finally find one that doesn’t contain rose but i just put it on and it smells like taco seasoning so now i guess i understand why they all have rose
3316 2018-08-29 16:58:00 Guess: Which culinary speciality prepared with salt, brine or oil, now PGI certified, has been the pride of Collioure since the Middle Ages?
3317 2018-08-29 16:58:00 Yup, made with black pepper, paprika, herbs, salt and a bit of oil. 
3318 2018-08-29 16:57:42 Getting my oil done... quick $100. Spend 
3319 2018-08-29 16:57:39 Tech is the new wealth in Nigeria. The nation's over dependence on oil is becoming a thing of the past.

3322 2018-08-29 16:57:34 ...the cost of ownership of a motor vehicle is rising (insurance companies are already bailing on that industry, oil prices are never going down until they peak and crash), the space available is decreasing, and people value convenience over everything...

Brady never gets criticism. Stop

3332 2018-08-29 16:56:31 Canada spends $4.5b on dirty oil.  
The rest of the world is actually making that change spending their billions on the Hydrogen Economy.  So sad as Canada's Ballard Power was the beginning of it all. Yet ignored by its own country.  
TSX + 7%--- DOW + 46% since 2007.  Pathetic!

Hi wm we recently moved our oil tank to a different part of the garden would any of ye know anyone who can hook oil tanks back up please? Tia
3335 2018-08-29 16:56:02 You mean the highly subsidized coal industry, or the highly subsidized oil industry? MORE people are employed by the solar industries than the coal ones. Energy is not a left or right issue, so take your propaganda and shove it.
3336 2018-08-29 16:55:58 The dealership just basically told me, my oil dipstick is lying to me.
3337 2018-08-29 16:55:56 Which essential oil invoke the most joy when using?
3338 2018-08-29 16:55:42 Sometimes I mix lemon oil with Shea butter, other times I just let it be and pray

3340 2018-08-29 16:55:32 Could it be China behind all this disruption, by intervening to push out mid-east oil money (they abhor)? China has much to gain without you.

China + complicit $ hungry tech w/ media ties + clueless local socialists (Sanders, Feinstein). Senator Rubio might be spot-on.
3341 2018-08-29 16:55:21 My olive oil is in clear bottles since-ever, and nothing happens to it. Stays clear.
3342 2018-08-29 16:54:57 Regardless of party, our government has failed to neutralize businesses that cultivated/extracted resources that were also leaking money (sugar cane and oil), in a timely fashion. Our revenue streams were cut off for the sake of pocketing money and now we have to restructure them
3343 2018-08-29 16:54:45 They made a bomb, man. They put Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum together. One can't really act, and the other acts like a good actor acting badly. Then they rubbed oil on Eddie Redmayne's face.
3344 2018-08-29 16:54:45 This is precisely wrong, which is why oil interests are scared.
3345 2018-08-29 16:54:37 Where TF the dealership get the audacity to charge $70 for a OIL CHANGE. Lord Jesus 
3346 2018-08-29 16:54:28 AW :( PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF WELL!! IM NOT REALLY DOING MUCH BETTER :( JUST NOW WHILE I WAS COOKING DINNER,, MY FINGER TOUCHED BOILING HOT OIL SO NOW I HAVE A WEIRD SHAPED BLISTER :(

3348 2018-08-29 16:54:17 The beard oil smells so wonderful and I use it to tame frizz (though the pomade is even better at that!) but I kinda like to just put some on my hands and smell it before I go to bed because the scent is just that calming.
3349 2018-08-29 16:54:15 i need a full body massage, a facial, sauna time, and some essential oil. im so tense

3355 2018-08-29 16:53:34 Before that declaration, have you ever heard Buhari mention June 12? The only causes Buhari has advocated for outside govt are herdsmen and Boko Haram. This is a fact not opinion.

3363 2018-08-29 16:52:46 Western gas cheap. Aramco sells 10 million+ barrels a day. You know who it isn't cheap for? The people at the bottom buying it. As we invade and sap all the Middle Easts oil the price of petrol has risen from 82p p/l to £1.34, so the public gain nothing but a humanitarian crisis.

3409 2018-08-29 16:47:34 Lukoil – The second largest #Russian oil company was dubbed one of “the favorites” to develop oil fields in Iran. But the company decided at the end of May that it would no longer pursue any joint ventures with Iranian oil companies due to the impending U.S. sanctions.

3413 2018-08-29 16:47:09 There is no research that doesn’t support it. If you do find a study, see who funded the researcher. The big oil companies knew about this since the 70’s and even conducted research on how this would affect their bottom line. Get over it.

3417 2018-08-29 16:46:34 It’s fucked up that the “best” Big Oil & Associates can do to change our fossil fuel addiction and it’s addiction to fossil fuel cold hard cash is to create a financial rewards system to incentivize reduction of use on “high demand” days. Fuck off.

3421 2018-08-29 16:46:24 In my lifetime I have seen America transform from land of opportunity to a fascist shithole. Starting wars for oil, jailing people without fair trial and still calling Russia the problem. Wake up Americans!
3422 2018-08-29 16:46:21 Atta boy JT. That 'ill show him. Screw with 20% of the Canadian economy? Meh!  Long as we keep that Saudi oil flowin' it's all good.

3428 2018-08-29 16:45:35 I can accept the notion that if we reduce the burning of fossil fuels we will reduce the climate influencing factors that we contribute to climate change. But to say that ending the oil industry will stop forest fires is disingenuous

3430 2018-08-29 16:45:31 Drilbur. By spinning its body it can even flatten steel oil drums.
3431 2018-08-29 16:45:31 What is that one thing you can stop doing that will give you more time and happiness? This weekend I had the oil changed instead of doing it myself. Saved me a couple hours. Thanks @jiffylube #Entrepreneur #focus #hireoutdistractions #workonyourbusiness
3432 2018-08-29 16:45:19 It will be debilitating and don’t think there is much that can be done. We can only work to keep jobs in the USA and slowly buy back gold to replace oil. It is tricky and hard to pull off. It probably won’t work. Don’t really think is a way to save the dollar.

3436 2018-08-29 16:44:45 Why do a small group of executives gets to profit off internet, or banking, or oil? They didn't do the work of building or maintaining those systems.

Why not give cash bonuses to workers with ingenious ideas, instead of owners? Profit motive should include folks not born rich.
3437 2018-08-29 16:44:44 I learned how to do an oil change and change my tire today  I’m so proud

3451 2018-08-29 16:43:03 I only got the samples. I like the beard oil more but this is great too. I poured all my samples in a spray bottle.
3452 2018-08-29 16:43:01 1. “cetaphil oil removing face wash” (the foamy one can dry out your face if u dont moisturez)
2. wash with benzoyl peroxide—i was prescribed this when i first had severe acne, but the “clean & clear advantage 3-in-1 exfoliating cleanser w/ benzoyl peroxide” works just as well

3470 2018-08-29 16:41:28 I do agree that there is a possibility that the dollar will be ousted. It might be a good idea for Americans to invest in gold as one option to weather this (not only option). Since we have passed laws to decrease businesses and went oil as standard, we were doomed.
3471 2018-08-29 16:41:26 got to sit in on the House of Representatives today while they were talking about the settlement money from the BP oil spill
3472 2018-08-29 16:41:20 he say little oil Price. Oga go and drink Sheraton coffee and google the price of oil for over one year it has been on the raise. Take this lies to BMC ejoor.

3496 2018-08-29 16:38:56 Is sweet almond oil okay as a moisturizer? I just got it and have been using it. I read that it could break me out in the first couple of weeks but it’s normal. Thoughts?

3499 2018-08-29 16:38:26 You can play semantics all you like, fact is oil still isn't up to pre recession levels.  None of this has anything to do with government policy.

3502 2018-08-29 16:38:08 If you can find me "science" I will say if we stopped the oil industry the climate will stop changing then I'll agree with you. Of course if it's peer-reviewed only
3503 2018-08-29 16:38:01 Probably more toward my field, i couldnt tell you how people start an oil painting but i cpuld tell you the difference between exposure, aperture, and ISO settings on a camera

3508 2018-08-29 16:37:41 Cda must share national target equitably among provs. That's never been done. It doesn't make sense to give cement, steel, and aluminium a bye on 90% of their existing emissions nor give oil sands the ok to increase emissions by nearly 50%. We'll not make Paris w/o doing that.2/
3509 2018-08-29 16:37:37 We have a technology that recovers oil from produced water. During that process, we also make electricity, about 2.5 MW per waste stream per well. We distill water, so injection wells become obsolete. Electricity production is 24/7, a great match for wind. Call us 714-647-1333

3531 2018-08-29 16:35:49 I looked into lard after @altonbrown was like, use it, it's not the devil and was shocked at how much better it is for humans than, say, canola oil.

3547 2018-08-29 16:34:16 This is awesome.  Thank you!!  I've been educating a local holistic Veterinarian who's patients are already using CBD oil on their pets.  Any other info you can provide would be much appreciated.

3551 2018-08-29 16:33:36 I will provide the general public with oil and bread
3552 2018-08-29 16:33:34 Waymo isn’t so much of a threat to oil and incumbents, that’s why
3553 2018-08-29 16:33:34 China which overtook the U.S. as the biggest importer of crude oil in 2017 will be replaced by India due to 2 trends: alternative energy sources & a more efficient freight system.
3554 2018-08-29 16:33:32 Probably just until the hat chips float in the oil, no?
3555 2018-08-29 16:33:29 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
3556 2018-08-29 16:32:56 In my childhood Pentecostal experience the line was that it was a blessing: you were being "annointed in oil," choosen by the Holy Spirit and also that it was the language of Angels. No one thought of recording the words but I do remember one person saying "cutapie" a lot
3557 2018-08-29 16:32:55 my car needs an oil change 

throw the whole car away
3558 2018-08-29 16:32:49 I believe the tow truck driver.  I'm just afraid now that they did more damage to my car.  Hell they can't even change the damn oil right so now I'm supposed to believe they didn't F up my battery when they were seeing how much damage they did in the first place?
3559 2018-08-29 16:32:41 I jerk off with cooking oil once in a while
3560 2018-08-29 16:32:37 Absurd to think that if we stop the oil industry we will stop climate change. Or even slow climate change.
3561 2018-08-29 16:32:27 We made the mistake years ago of taking the dollar off gold and backing it with oil.
3562 2018-08-29 16:32:22 To try to go to Iowa Saturday after work or stay in town and go to @zeke_beats. I have a lot going on and am under a lot of stress and still haven't even gotten my oil change for my car which I'd need to do to drive up there. And my new roommate is moving in that day

3570 2018-08-29 16:31:37 No la energía renovable no es energía de punta. Es interesante para reducir costos y emisiones pero siempre será necesario gas, fuel oil y carbón. Lo pongo en orden de importancia.
3571 2018-08-29 16:31:33 Yield curve will change when market perception of supply urgency changes. We are in a brief relapse of supply concern now that will fade as it has several times this year. Flat U.S. rig count says urgency not a factor...yet. Weaker oil demand is my concern (not peak demand).

3583 2018-08-29 16:30:36 Wrong. He wants us to use oil. That's all he has. Democrats reduce our dependency on oil and increase investment in other fuel sources. Lower demand, lower profits for Putin.
3584 2018-08-29 16:30:30 The first campaign I ran ended in a TPK because the scout was carrying 8 gallons of lamp oil on his person and a foe happened to have prepared Scorching Ray that day.
3585 2018-08-29 16:30:27 Oil Prices rose, supported by news of a fall in Iranian crude supplies as U.S. sanctions deter buyers, but gains were limited by evidence of a rise in U.S. inventories.

3587 2018-08-29 16:30:23 India set to overtake China as the biggest source of growth for oil demand by 2024. The country's expanding middle class will be a key factor & a growing need for mobility.

3593 2018-08-29 16:29:57 Calling other dread heads, what oil would you recommend for locs? I was considering coconut oil but heard it leaves residue :/
3594 2018-08-29 16:29:54 Ironically they will need plenty of oil to keep those things running. Will they stop all gas cars from hitting the road? Will they stop all factories from operation? They can’t go 100% that’s a dream nothing more
3595 2018-08-29 16:29:48 We are truly living in the essential oil era 
Was just having lunch with a few colleagues and I expressed I had a raging headache and they all, in unison responded, “Dang! I left my peppermint oil at home today!! That would’ve been good for you.”
3596 2018-08-29 16:29:47 I don’t like wax :( and all the plugs that have hit me up for cartridges don’t have any thc oil they only have wax
3597 2018-08-29 16:29:44 I'm working on a new oil painting project, but it has to be done in stages... I got restless & did a couple of political cartoons.

3598 2018-08-29 16:29:40 Several #Mississippi senators are in the House chamber while the House debates bill to distribute BP oil spill money. Senators worked late Tuesday to pass the bill. #msleg
3599 2018-08-29 16:29:38 Nope, but the Koch bros deserve being held accountable for their corruption of US politics. There are lots of rich guys with no scruples .. oil wealthy Putin likely tops the list!
3600 2018-08-29 16:29:37 They also have this ridiculously good olive oil shake or something. Do try that!
3601 2018-08-29 16:29:27 These constantly changing reports are gong to kill us earlier. I always heard Coconut oil was good for you then week in a report it became deadly for you. Please don't rush reports and do your homework before telling the public whats a new wonder then it kills you a year later!
3602 2018-08-29 16:29:24 Aye... if my daddy paying for it. I’m making that drive. Oil change Wednesdays.

3606 2018-08-29 16:29:13 I marinate cubed tofu in braggs (basically soy sauce to my unsophisticated palette) and a little sesame oil for a few then fry it til it feels the way i want.
You can add it to anything or just eat it. If i add sesame seeds, it magically becomes 1000x more fancy to my son..

3610 2018-08-29 16:28:44 Literally stole half of Mexico, driving the country into poverty, while enriching the US -- oil, gold, etc. Basically, everything bad happening to Mexico is a result of Tyler and Polk as presidents.
3611 2018-08-29 16:28:32 Then feel free to link to your sources which show renewable energy displacing liquid fuels and the associated decrease in world oil demand.

3620 2018-08-29 16:27:49 Chia seeds are a native food crop. I'm also fascinated by how #lard was demonized in favor of flavorless trans fat laden vegetable shortenings in the early 20th century. Lard, which is 45% monounsaturated fat (oleic acid, the same thing in olive oil), became "unhealthy".

3626 2018-08-29 16:27:27 Eastern Canada, does not buy oil from Alberta.  They buy it from Saudi Arabia.  This was a decision the Liberal Party decided, and its never changed. 

I'm not sure why "some terrorists" came from a country nearly 20 years ago has anything to do with a travel ban.
3627 2018-08-29 16:27:25 Let's get rid of corporate subsidies, after all, why are well-established, big profit, big oil companies still getting government subsidies?

3650 2018-08-29 16:25:18 Labour has absolutely no plans to rely on one industry (oil), and will not have it's debt denominated in dollars. So crying "Venezuela", as many right wingers do, is simply lazy rhetoric with no basis in reality.

3669 2018-08-29 16:23:18 Like I said, we're at the beginning. Such high production has been enabled by farming techniques which are degrading soil, and by vastly expanded land use. Palm oil is destroying rainforests for example, which is already contributing to CO2 emissions.

3691 2018-08-29 16:21:06 Your agreeing with Mike about government control but it wouldn’t be. It would be government regulation as the government regulates many companies. As they regulate everything from beef , to oil

3694 2018-08-29 16:20:56 Cuba is socialist & is doing far better than the US in matters of public services. 

As I said, Venezuela under Chavez was socialism but then Maduro moved into an entirely oil economy. 

The NHS is a socialist system. So if you hate socialism then you must oppose the NHS, no?

3696 2018-08-29 16:20:54 @ImranKhanPTI  pm just once go to trible area and issue license to private co for oil and gas exploration especially in miranshah.dattakhel spera ghar and tank area so change will come in 6 months pl.
3697 2018-08-29 16:20:50 It's averagely steady and as well work progress... What matters is that the investment are yielding result especially with transport dominating the non oil sector returns. If we've had the same development template consistently, we would not be here.

Infrastructure is critical
3698 2018-08-29 16:20:43 What job security? He was laid off in 2015 like many in the oil patch. He pays less tax now but I think he would rather be making more money.
3699 2018-08-29 16:20:39 Try macadamia oil for removing makeup. I love it. Also the Korean products by COSRX (the snails creams are so good).

3706 2018-08-29 16:19:55 The front of my hair is growing so long when I stretch it it goes underneath my neck Jamaican black castor oil is starting to work 
3707 2018-08-29 16:19:47 I think that’s exactly what happened. He spurred lots of activity with capital thinking it could run wild AND oil has gone from $50 to $75 in a year.
3708 2018-08-29 16:19:45 Spiders don't like olive oil. Have you tried tempting it out with a fly?

Gently caress your entire foot, then toes each night before bed.

3716 2018-08-29 16:19:00 Analysis: Tug of war for oil sector looking to feast after famine: After years of restraint since crude prices slumped in 2014, oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the sector recovery.
3717 2018-08-29 16:18:59 I hope one had a decent meal, say veal saltimbocca w a side of linguine with oil and garlic. Do we want public servants living large on our dimes? Can't they buy their own pasta dammit?

3720 2018-08-29 16:18:30 You just answered my previous question!

Came home to 120 tweets on Tripoli and so many on my account no counter!  There are some very inflammatory tweets, no RT from me, don't need oil on this fire
3721 2018-08-29 16:18:16 You run an olive oil business. That stuff spreads great on bodies. Just saying...

3725 2018-08-29 16:17:40 Great, thanks @loccitane_UK that's great. @greenpeace has shown that some certification is a respectable front for bad behaviour at the start of the supply chain. You've traded on natural values for years so I assume you visit the plantations from which your palm oil comes?
3726 2018-08-29 16:17:38 And for the oil in Syria, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, the Americans being 'mist greedy' not willing to change to greener technologies fastest + peacefully, not willing to commute otherwise than in big cars on cheapest petrol

3729 2018-08-29 16:17:21 You mean all the billions of dollars by which our reserves dwindlled even during the time of oil boom went into the water they started taking serious in 2015?
3730 2018-08-29 16:17:14 Sure
Gas is actually a byproduct of refining the oil to make the kerosine, but as an artist- was taking “artistic license” to make a point. It’s called a metaphor- a little college would assist you understanding metaphors
3731 2018-08-29 16:17:06 cbd oil is a gateway drug
3732 2018-08-29 16:17:03 But as you've received $223,840 from the oil and gas industry, and continue to engage in climate change denial, we don't anticipate you'll play any part in transitioning Illinois to a more sustainable energy future.

3738 2018-08-29 16:16:13 Canada's concern should not be NAFTA which for the most part is original NAFTA agreement with wage increases- Canada PM must now consider Mexico's New PM  A. M. L. Obrador who is removing energy regulations allowing Mexico oil production to triple as Canada has no pipeline.

3744 2018-08-29 16:15:35 Shell’s priority is maximum return to its shareholders, and it’s doing quite well at that. Oil companies pulling out of Alberta is not a good sign, regardless of how NDP fans choose to spin it.

3749 2018-08-29 16:14:51 the cleaness of the oil is totally irrelevant

home food has less conservatives but it's still filled with oil and cholesterol
3750 2018-08-29 16:14:49 Seems to me Alex Salmond has one huge credibility problem, he lost it all back in 2014. White paper, oil everywhere, EU legal advice.
3751 2018-08-29 16:14:46 They can go home as beside Idlib the Golan Heights and Eastern oil rich Syria the country is free. The Golan Heights(Israel) and Eastern Syria (America) are kept by them because both are rich in oil.
3752 2018-08-29 16:14:37 Nothing. Something told me to try coconut oil?  I'm open to suggestions!

3755 2018-08-29 16:14:12 Exactly. What comes to mind, all those cowboy movies, like Bonanza. There was always big cart/van thing in center of town selling snake oil, telling people, would cure all ills. I sat there, 12 years old, practically screaming at the TV, don't buy that stuff, it doesn't work!

Give us a generation or two to clean up our lakes and beaches.

We might even get Big Oil and Big Sugar to foot more of the bill for their damage

3795 2018-08-29 16:09:05 Yes, If they leave, we will stop selling them cheap,water,hrdro-electric and oil. So really not a big threat. Canada has a surplus with the US, which means they do need us more than we need them. It's a Global economy.

3803 2018-08-29 16:08:41 That's the beauty of the scheme, no one who sells to China, whether it's Iran, Russia, or some other oil producer, is putting their oil behind the Yuan. They are putting it behind gold in lieu of Yuan payment.

3807 2018-08-29 16:08:28 I think Canada should shut off all hydro power,oil,wood and water going to the U.S. indefinitely!
Unless they want to start bargaining in good faith on NAFTA.
That fucktard Trump has gotta go!
Probably a ban on the entire Trump family coming to Canada ever would be good too.
3808 2018-08-29 16:08:23 Someone teach me how to change my car’s oil i can’t be waiting 2 hours every time i have to get my oil changed.
3809 2018-08-29 16:08:15 The increase is definitely coming. The Rand has been in the doldrums for most of the month and oil prices have been on the uptick.
3810 2018-08-29 16:08:03 Found a split end in my beard this morning and put on way more beard oil than necessary.
3811 2018-08-29 16:07:51 So funded by government oil sales, or pay a shit ton in taxes? 

Or the one that forces everyone to pay for it themselves that Obamacare is based on?
3812 2018-08-29 16:07:43 Hmmmm sebenernya intinya water based dulu baru oil based. Masalah toner dulu apa essence dulu, apa serum dulu tuh sebenernya tergantung konsistensinya juga. Toner, essence, serum, dll tuh hanya penamaan gais, jgn dijadiin patokan buat urutan
3813 2018-08-29 16:07:38 Yep. Hasn’t even been a year. To celebrate I’m getting the first oil change done. woo
3814 2018-08-29 16:07:30 So you are saying that hurricanes are Republicans now? when did a natural disaster hit during Obama's presidency you also ask for an inquest based upon its political affiliation? Was the BP oil spill also Republican?
3815 2018-08-29 16:07:16 Peer pressure can really cause persons make some dumb decisions
3816 2018-08-29 16:07:10 I don’t know if you’ve watched the investment industry for oil and gas around the world, but something shifted a few years ago, what’s that called? Oh yeah, the price of oil. And if I’m a lefty, the world is a strange place.
3817 2018-08-29 16:06:59 Lowkey #BeautyTip. Rub coconut oil on your brows and lashes before going to bed to help them grow. Insert wherever you think it’s best in your 6,8 or 10 step korean skin care routine.

3826 2018-08-29 16:06:23 I lost my favorite shade of my clarins lip oil and I’m kinda mad about it lol I need to find it
3827 2018-08-29 16:06:21 The cost of a new deep sea oil rig is $500 million. Used ones cheaper. Less than a billion & a fully self governing seastead is possible. Enough gold/uranium in sea water to cover costs of admin/maintenance plus money from aquaculture, gaming, hospitality, medical tourism
3828 2018-08-29 16:06:16 He's the type of 'snake oil' sales person that the ND say we should all avoid. But the 'snake oil' he is selling appeals to the ND mob

3830 2018-08-29 16:06:11 I toured an olive oil factory once and every time the lady said "all of" I lost it

We will find out

3834 2018-08-29 16:05:40 最終日にガヴェインで行けたけど
3835 2018-08-29 16:05:35 I agree especially coconut oil! It really works well! Thank you for your advices! 
3836 2018-08-29 16:05:29 I LOVE the idea of not having to change a puncture or do the oil thing, knowing my luck though I’ll end up with a puncture miles away from anywhere! 
3837 2018-08-29 16:05:28 uminom ako castor oil para mapapoo-poo, ‘di ko first time pero leche nakakadiri talagaaa, naluwa ko ‘yung pangatlong kutsara jusme 
3838 2018-08-29 16:05:24 悪龍ジーク即死狙ってたバカならここにおるぞ
3839 2018-08-29 16:05:19 I'm not selling the stuff, it's pretty expensive imo they should lower price and get better market volume. I also tried C60-olive oil but it seemed to dangerous so I'm sticking with Q's because they got good human tox data.
3840 2018-08-29 16:05:17 my nose is the largest oil source in the world and i don’t get paid shit :(
3841 2018-08-29 16:05:05 สวย
3842 2018-08-29 16:04:55 Very dirty for engine oil, looks more like chain grease/lube dripping out of front spocket cover
3843 2018-08-29 16:04:50 Need oil change and tire rotation , don’t feel like doing anything 
3844 2018-08-29 16:04:47 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 29 August @ 18:00

3845 2018-08-29 16:04:46 Nah baby oil is too heavy for me. You really tryna deep fry yourself.
3846 2018-08-29 16:04:41 Wish he paid as much attention to CA Aquifers, continuing to be contaminated be oil extraction wastewater.
3847 2018-08-29 16:04:34 Yet those baggars will not allow another man use Eagles square
3848 2018-08-29 16:04:19 If even marginal sellers of oil, let alone major producers, find the opportunity to acquire physical payment attractive, thereby alleviating concerns about holding Yuan, then this can have a material effect, even a critical one, on "the flow."
3849 2018-08-29 16:04:11  omg what kind of oil?!?
3850 2018-08-29 16:04:05 I had a 77 Kawasaki 250 2-cycle Enduro. I can't believe I didn't kill myself. Auto oil feed! I'd love that bike back.
3851 2018-08-29 16:04:04 I’ll say it again, confirmed news sources demonstrated that Putin for years has openly promised oil and gas futures  money to anyone who will join him in fighting Muslim terrorism thus the silence or support of congressional Trumpsters?
3852 2018-08-29 16:03:45 Try putting g the shampoo on your hair before wetting it, then the beeswaxs has something to grab onto, then it should come out of the hair,because if you just pour water onto a wax it just drips off, just like oil and water don't mix.
3853 2018-08-29 16:03:39 Bulletproof coffee. Add a little MCT oil.

3857 2018-08-29 16:03:10 @LagosTalks913 Let me sound a note of warning. We are at the close of the fossil fuel age and our children will not drive fossil fuel vehicles and thats not a long time to wait for. Let’s enjoy our oil while the demand for it lasts.
3858 2018-08-29 16:03:09 There’s a lot of snake oil here

3861 2018-08-29 16:02:58 Baghdad battery. No excavation has ever produced evidence of primitive lamps that burned oil. They found objects with Crystals that amplified electricity. So yes, they had it an acoustic load bearing tech. That's why Egypt is over 95% buried today. Its under the sand.
3862 2018-08-29 16:02:49 @BP_plc Tankers leaving #HorseHill making their way to Hamble give a good indication of how much oil there is south of London. If declaration of commerciality is made, I'm assuming #BP will be looking at purchasing #ukog to take advantage of a huge investment?
3863 2018-08-29 16:02:46 Spilled castor oil everywhere 
3864 2018-08-29 16:02:40 Cannibas oil is very useful
3865 2018-08-29 16:02:38 I love how when I did Bulletproof Coffee (Keto) everyone thought it was SO SICKENING that I put coconut oil and butter in my coffee , but now “Keto Coffee” is all the rage 
3866 2018-08-29 16:02:23 Recent trade agreement between Mexico and the United States DO NOT address the damning consequences for the US energy sector via increased Mexican oil production.
3867 2018-08-29 16:02:20 I recommend an oil as a makeup remover especially for the oily skins ! It work better than a makeup remover,  it's cheap and natural annnd it's nourishing
3868 2018-08-29 16:02:15 A vote for Rick Scott is a vote for Red Tide, destroying the coastline with oil wells off out coast. Increased corruption in Washington. Rick Scott will reduce healthcare coverage for millions & kiss Trump's ass
3869 2018-08-29 16:02:04 I need tea tree oil ASAP
3870 2018-08-29 16:01:58 Vitamin E from food or in oil form is a good way to nourish and heal skin imperfections like scars, stretch marks and skin dryness.
3871 2018-08-29 16:01:42 These would be fab to have in my kitchen!! 
I always cook with rapeseed oil 
3872 2018-08-29 16:01:38 I’m craving tomatoes??? Am I about to go to the grocery story for basil just to eat with this tomato in my fridge?  With kosher salt, olive oil & cracked black pepper?? 
3873 2018-08-29 16:01:37 That place is decent. Pro tip, olive oil erases cholesterol. I mean it just cancels it out completely.
3874 2018-08-29 16:01:35 To be fair, that doesn't excuse the organization for selling snake oil. 

The separation of church and state is not an applicable reason for greedy cognitive dissonance within a corporation....
3875 2018-08-29 16:01:26 หิว ออกไปกินไก่ทอดดีมั้ย
3876 2018-08-29 16:01:24 Nevertheless, if there were no regulations at all, you could have gotten olive oil cocktailed with everything else. I'm sorry you got dicked over, however, I would rather have some type of recourse rather than a "Buyer beware" standard when I buy a dime.
3877 2018-08-29 16:01:21 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
3878 2018-08-29 16:01:18 I need a oil change hella bad. I’m like 400 miles over and I never do this

3881 2018-08-29 16:00:59 Cinnamon oil is super burny. It can cause serious skin irritation.
3882 2018-08-29 16:00:56 *cracks knuckles* time to get out the oil paints. If you like it, I will be more than happy to bring it to my VIP in Spartanburg :)
3883 2018-08-29 16:00:56 Go get this oil change bih I refuse to sit still 
3884 2018-08-29 16:00:55 Oil prices have risen significantly
3885 2018-08-29 16:00:50 These prices should be reduced:
Unga 2Kgs-100 
Sugar1kg - 100
Cooking oil 2liters 250
Milk - 50

Budget -500

Wages per day 200

Cost of living -300
3886 2018-08-29 16:00:42 I think it's more like it's hard to argue for hurting oil company profits to fight global warming or demand worker rights standards for AAPL
3887 2018-08-29 16:00:41 I have traveled the world and speaking about sheeple, you have no clue!
Socialist utopias do not exists!  Norway? They subsidize the economy with oil revenues which are down and now they are worried. It costs thousands of Euros just to get a drivers license. Taxes are outrageous
3888 2018-08-29 16:00:40 easy-to-follow steps to use Pure Ultra Hemp 800

2. Fill the dropper with hemp oil and put the number of drops needed under your tongue. Hold for 60 seconds then swallow. This allows you to absorb as much of the Pure Ultra Hemp nutrients as possible.

3912 2018-08-29 15:57:33 When they decide to sit on the floor I enjoy advising them not to as I name off all the wonderful things I’ve come across in the bike lanes in SOMA. Dead rat, dead pigeon, feces of unknown origin, needles, hair extensions, urine, motor oil, glass...etc.
3913 2018-08-29 15:57:24 Do u think that continually increasing oil spills will not have devastating cumulative affects on our oceans/sealife, because pipelines are the solution to oil transport? The gov't doc @BlairKing_ca referenced is deeply flawed.  DFO involvement is questionable.
3914 2018-08-29 15:57:23 I'm on the ketogenics diet that promotes healthy saturated fat like butter. A lot of folks doing keto put butter or coconut oil in their coffee and blend it. It's healthy; does not spike insulin.  For me, I like it black. In your country, I think they called my drink a long black

3916 2018-08-29 15:57:16 No natural gas is a product from our earth also, let them in the earth, you were see, the oil and gas into the earth, is a peace from our planet,the earth plates slipped over the oil, when the oil is gone,it can not slip anymore,and you will see that bad earthquakes happen!
3917 2018-08-29 15:57:14 I feel like coconut oil just fixes everything 
3918 2018-08-29 15:57:12 Yep, they a professor working for General Electric genetically engineered a new form of (pseudomonas putida) the oil eating bacteria in 1971 bc the natural oil eating bacteria would always compete with each other instead of eating all the oil.. funfact

3923 2018-08-29 15:56:06 Silence as well as support for Trump and his love of Putin could be a sign that Russian money has entered supporters campaign funding? Putin has openly promised oil and gas futures to any one joining him in fighting Muslim terrorists.
3924 2018-08-29 15:56:01 Their oil sector is doing ok and so is ours but they are not hiring.
3925 2018-08-29 15:55:46 As usual Kenney doesn't know a single thing. Shell, and other oil & gas companies have put substantial monies into carbon tax and green technologies like offshore wind power, solar farms, electric cars etc. They see the writing on the wall. Save the planet
3926 2018-08-29 15:55:34 Which type of oil ,palm oil or frytol oil
3927 2018-08-29 15:55:32 I support many #NDP policies but i can not support @theJagmeetSingh policy on #Alberta oil exports.
He does support manufacturing gas burning cars.

3930 2018-08-29 15:55:18 I agree he won those states with the help of his Russian allies and partners in bringing down the free world to ttheir level. I also agree with the Steele dossier and Trump getting a piece of Rosneft Oil in return for lifting sanctions .
3931 2018-08-29 15:55:06 Gas oil y fuerte.
3932 2018-08-29 15:55:05 this isn't exactly a powerful rebuke of his reporting. if you are going to blindly shill for oil companies, you should consider making a stronger argument than this load of "horse manure." grow up, kid.
3933 2018-08-29 15:54:59 Uh...maybe you can understand there was an oil downturn in Alberta.
3934 2018-08-29 15:54:27 potato salad with oil and vinegar is... actually something we do here

3938 2018-08-29 15:53:35 Depends on how thick they're sliced and what kind and how much of oil. You can get some very good and healthier crisps in shops. Go for vegan friendly ones if you're worried about artificial flavour

3941 2018-08-29 15:53:12 put drops of lavender oil on my roommates' pillow i feel like a garden nymph the whole rooms smells like lavender
3942 2018-08-29 15:53:10 Depends on where you draw inspiration from. You could also change brushes to make it seem more like the texture of say oil or acrylic paints. Ive seen some fab digital brushes that make you question if that was painted traditionally
3943 2018-08-29 15:53:05 Keep Oklahoma broke, low teacher pay, poor education, fracking earthquakes resulting in lower property values, Big Oil running the show while GOP pols line their pockets getting rich at the expense of the citizens.  Wake up Oklahoma!

3947 2018-08-29 15:52:28 WD40 is expensive and overrated + Trump is liable to ban its export. For your thumb you're better using olive oil, especially if you are prone to sucking it. For best results a mix of olive oil & Tory MP's tears - but they're hard to source - you may have to wait until after indy
3948 2018-08-29 15:52:22 We have Local content regulations in the Oil and Gas Industry. Problem must be implementation. Certain goods and services are ring fenced for only Ugandan companies.

3956 2018-08-29 15:50:58 One of Norway’s main exports is oil which means the tariffs are very low. Their economy is basically that and fish. They still went for an existing framework rather than the unicorns both major political parties are offering.
3957 2018-08-29 15:50:48 Russian news and oil higher is good for Ruble

It's funny how you go back to recession levels for oil prices but only one year for drilling numbers. Care to go back to when oil was $70 and guess how many rigs were drilling?
3988 2018-08-29 15:48:18 Dear bottom pickers... 

Don't.

Only knife I've been catching lately is Africa Oil $AOI.to as it's trading near cash and technicals signaling a bottom.
3989 2018-08-29 15:48:18 OIL 15M "technically" completed 5 waves up and dipped just enough to have a correction for proper 3rd wave up, which will push above 50MA on 1D chart TODAY as it drifts higher. WATCH for break out above 69.39, very bullish signal. UWT ?

3994 2018-08-29 15:47:54 If you ignore rhetoric and look at the obvious fact that oil prices plummeted in 2015, you'll understand why that happened.  You also need to gain an understanding of the different types of petroleum being tapped in different geological areas and the costs of processing.

4016 2018-08-29 15:46:47 The reality is dawning on our economy now we are complaining. Sanitising the system is no joke but we've got to bear it.

4023 2018-08-29 15:45:39 Shameless
4024 2018-08-29 15:45:35 Also the short answer is yes. We'd import like other non oil/gas producers and prices would fluctuate based on global prices. A model we should have moved too during boom times when the pain wouldn't have been felt as much if we being honest but unions and politicians.
4025 2018-08-29 15:45:32 Declassified documents make clear the CIA was undermining Carter for not being sufficiently pro-war.  Please check your facts.

So when shale oil goes up 4X or 5X, same possibility exists for associated gas. And some new pipes are for gas plays, not associated.

4143 2018-08-29 15:34:52 You are right. It's a package deal. Enemies, sanctions relief, free rein in Europe, destabilize Western alliance, increase the price of oil. Russia is running our government.
4144 2018-08-29 15:34:52 Yeah, we know. Everything I buy on a regular basis has gone up. From gasoline to the gluten free bread to motor oil for my truck has gone up in the last year.

4156 2018-08-29 15:33:47 Burnt brussel sprouts are not good. Why do restaurants burn the shit out brussel sprouts on purpose? Sautee those shits in some fat or oil and call it a day. Lower the heat. Either cook them slower or don't serve it at all.
4157 2018-08-29 15:33:32 Our country is so much more important than our Party affiliation. I can’t support anyone who divides the country and only considers himself the President of racist, uneducated, bottom feeders.Donald J.

All of them owned by billionaires that get the benefit of the wars, banking, oil etc.
You will never hear truth from them.
4171 2018-08-29 15:32:20 Is your supply curve based on proven reserves? If so the gap will be filled to a significant extent by the difference between proven and probable reserves. This is important because it bears on the question whether entirely new oil resources need to be explored/developed.

4185 2018-08-29 15:30:47 It also speaks volumes about suicidal hypocrisy of some oil companies, trying to appease the Green Hysteria.
4186 2018-08-29 15:30:44 It needs to come DOWN! Consumers will spend more when the prices are FAIR!  Being one of the LARGEST producers of oil, Americans shouldn't have to pay high gas prices, PERIOD!

4189 2018-08-29 15:30:38 I bet Mr.Kessingers profile "Watts" picture is there probably because he thinks that his daughter is hitching with his daughter.  A sign that his boss thought highly of him. The guy owns an oil refinery and is NOT an Electrician. Does that sound about right?

4205 2018-08-29 15:29:32 I think the collapse of the Bretton-Woods system thanks to costs of the Vietnam War, the 1970's Oil Crisis and industrial unrest led to the resurgence of neo-Libaralism thinking and the election of Thatcher and Reagan.
4206 2018-08-29 15:29:29 Hey hun I took roaccutane at 16. It dehydrates your body from fluids and oil production. This includes your muscles aka less bone support.

4218 2018-08-29 15:28:21 @ProfOsinbajo India is the largest exporter of service- IT solutions, Technology, Outsourcing, Healthcare. China is the largest exporter of products(manufacturing).

It is well known for its ability to fight bacteria and reduce skin inflammation

It looks good but usability wise it's not easy to handle. Also I would not take glass bottle with me when I am traveling

4243 2018-08-29 15:26:14 Today’s the day. For the first time ever I did not take my car to my dad’s shop for an oil change, or do it myself at the shop. It feels weird, I don’t like it, and it also means it’s been too long since I’ve seen my dad.
4244 2018-08-29 15:26:14 The economy failed because the govt replaced oil professionals with cronies who are unable to maintain production & thus tax revenues. And have done nix about this since. Inflation hurts the asset poor & cash dependent workers most. Is this socialism? U defend this? Blame USA?

4250 2018-08-29 15:25:48 New Mexico's Oil Conservation Div. is permitting direct venting of gas during both drilling and re-completing. That's a direct violation of EPA's rules.

Now Hilcorp on fast track to double the drilling. 

In the region that already has the Methane Hotspot. 

And 30,000 wells.

4257 2018-08-29 15:25:03 I never really liked the taste/smell of coconuts, but still got my first ever jar of coconut oil a while ago, and right after that I read that it actually clogs the pores and is not really good for hair, so I thought maybe I should just cook with it, but now it's also poison

4267 2018-08-29 15:24:14 Clearly somebody is plotting to deep fry you while you sleep, but hasn't yet had the courage to go through with it. I recommend remaining extra-vigilant and keeping the oil locked away in a safe place.

4294 2018-08-29 15:22:00 Indeed. The endless culture war is exhausting and absurd. I'm *extremely* sceptical about the motives of figures like Daubney, who want to weaponise the w/c for reactionary purposes whilst no doubt voting against all the things that would improve our lot.

4297 2018-08-29 15:21:47 Mr. Carter!  What about your false proclamation about oil shortage in the 1970s?  What about some of your biased statements on political situations at home and abroad?  "Nuff said".  #MAGA  BTW why does Cavuto have him on??

4321 2018-08-29 15:19:53 Let's do a back of the envelope calculation: Current flared volumes are 300-350 mmcf/d, according to WSJ report. Oil production in the Permian is already close to 3.5 million bbl/d...
4322 2018-08-29 15:19:36 Let's re-phrase your question to make it clear: "why don't we just use gasoline during the phase-out?" 

Heavy oil is a distinct product which produces a different hydrocarbon mix and gets better margins and produces less waste than light oil when run through a heavy oil refinery

In 2018: 
My boss asked me to calculate the flow rate of water consumption in our oil n gas facility.

Born to calculate water flow rate :D

4380 2018-08-29 15:14:40 Do you work for a palm oil company or something? most foods contain non sustainable palm oil and it is destroying the rainforest and orangutans. That's fine if you don't care about that. That's your perogative. As it is our to care about it. Take care. I've done here.
4381 2018-08-29 15:14:36 I tried the soda in the cake mix, but it came out as a flat sheet and didn't have much of a flavor. The pumpkin mixed with cake mix makes breakfast wonderful muffins. Applesauce substituted for oil works very well in quick cakes.

4389 2018-08-29 15:14:00 This is exactly right. Oil production predicted to greatly increase in Permian over next decade and gas along with it. Pipeline capacity lags production. Economic drivers alone won't get the job done. Especially in a low-cost gas environment.

4396 2018-08-29 15:13:16 And a lot of slick guys on the Street assumed it was a sound business strategy to finance that State's relentless public spending (and uninhibited corruption), based solely on the promise of vast oil reserves

4409 2018-08-29 15:11:39 Right but look at the growth. Associated gas volumes will be massive if Permian goes to 6 mln bbls a day of oil in next decade, and then Alpine High on top of that.

By next year, will have been four years of high flaring volume. What does short term mean in that sense?
4410 2018-08-29 15:11:34 Definitely on it. Also analyzing oil production over the years as well. Thank you for the suggestion.
4411 2018-08-29 15:11:30 I keep saying the same thing to people in regards to global warfare, just follow the money. Aramco is selling 10+ million barrels of oil a day n we get it cheap, not just them either, global terrorism is now being created so is mass migration, what doesn't change? Our gas prices.

4417 2018-08-29 15:10:26 I think it would be a more prudent interpretation to increase the rounds of burning than the damage. Like deal 10 fire damage over 4400turns. Or some middle ground.

You add oil to the lamp to prolong the fire not to make it hotter.

4441 2018-08-29 15:08:30 It's weird how Norway's fund made its money riding it's oil reserves and later riding safe US assets but that this is treated as a sustainable source and not exploitative.

4470 2018-08-29 15:05:43 Better approach of #TRAIN could be: personal income tax (PIT) cut; no tax hikes in oil, lpg, coal, sugary drinks; reduce VAT to 8-9% but remove all VAT exemptions except raw agri, fishery products.

4518 2018-08-29 15:02:01 The only thing I can think are items such as purchases of conflict oil over ethically produced Canadian oil simply because it’s cheaper. The argument of boycotting American hurts the Canadian importers long before it hurts Americans

Use Worstishire on one side and a very little bit of olive oil on the other. Stretch the steak a bit to get the sauce in

Castor oil for instance should be last because it coats the hair and acts as a sealant but avocado oil would be good to put on before cream.

4640 2018-08-29 14:51:15 Per 5E: 1 pint of oil costs 1 sp and does 10 fire damage over 2 turns.  55 gallons of lamp oil thus costs 44 gp and can cause up to 4400 fire damage over 2 rounds. Generally I rule it spreads over a 20 ft radius and burns for 10 rounds and divide the 4400 damage over the area.
4641 2018-08-29 14:51:09 No worry I go soon dey spend like you when I start dey sell palm oil.

4782 2018-08-29 14:36:32 CBD oil could help. With nearly no THC would it show up in drug testing? Eating a poppy seed bagel I heard could alter drug test. Not sure but wonder about it.

4790 2018-08-29 14:36:01 The 1973 Oil Crisis drove gas prices from $.50 a gallon to over $4.00
The rate of inflation from then to now is $1.00 in 1973 equals $5.68 in 2018
Are you willing to pay over $20.00 a gallon to drive your automobile?
That's economics 101 and you can always count on another crisis
4791 2018-08-29 14:36:00 i mean i guess it makes sense if you don’t like to see or feel all your makeup rub into a big oil puddle on your face which, in that case........ Cowards..............................
4792 2018-08-29 14:35:55 Ah, but $2.3 billion of our exports relate to canola oil.  Lots can happen down the road but given the current pressure on U.S. soybean prices (due to China tariffs), not hard to imagine a scenario where the U.S. imposes a tariff on our canola oil.
4793 2018-08-29 14:35:53 My boss bought me a CBD oil based tea and this morning and holy cow I almost feel a little weird due to the lack of pain and my anxiety is like 99% gone so it feels really weirdly calming, but not like getting high

4863 2018-08-29 14:30:44 we should think about restricting the licences, not issue new ones maybe, concentrate on renewables instead, after all, if it stays where it is we'll always have reserves should they be required in the future
in the meantime we should be deriving much greater benefit from oil

4868 2018-08-29 14:30:27 Great thinking! One side picks up all kinds of oil and shit (sometimes literally) due to its proximity to the ground, the other from your dirty shoes. Then you carry it like a conventional briefcase and transfer it all to your pants. Invented by a dry cleaner, no doubt.
4869 2018-08-29 14:30:25 Great pic bro! I am very interested to catch up and chat over the future of the oil industry with you!  Have a safe trip back to the UK!

4878 2018-08-29 14:29:53 I'm a realist. And lobbyists aren't necessarily bad. There are lobbyists for teachers & public employees, as there are for oil companies & lawyers. I think we get riled up enough that we vote $ stay active. Complacency is our enemy; we're never going to get $ out of politics.

4883 2018-08-29 14:29:08 Bloody easy. It's basically curry base gravy too so you can fry up various things in oil and spices then add this (if you make it with more onions, spinces and tomatoes) to bulk it out into a curry.

4888 2018-08-29 14:28:38 Industry itself seeks to get these standards, which stems back to property rights and contract law. 
Boris said it best "Fuck Industry", Brexit is highly reliant on selling lemon cars & snake oil as fair game, the problem is that game will bite the UK's specialised industries too
4889 2018-08-29 14:28:33 Allow and even support brutal dictators because they give us what we want (usually resources, like oil), then when the relationship is no longer convenient for us, take them out and label ourselves heroes.

4909 2018-08-29 14:26:39 All of this is because of the Russian oil (IMO), the $$ got cut off and everyone is doing everything in their power to disrupt so the money will flow again.  The sanctions affected their pockets and nothing is off the table to get the money flowing again.

4912 2018-08-29 14:26:13 My friend @leighbohlen makes essential oil sprays and my daughter loves to spray it on our pillows before bed.  She wakes up and says that she feels like it helped her go to sleep

4914 2018-08-29 14:26:05 Roasted cauliflower is a really great dish if u like it - arrange florets on baking tray, add soy sauce, sesame oil, chilli flakes, minced ginger, minced garlic, cumin. Then make sure mixture is evenly spread and bake until golden.

4921 2018-08-29 14:25:30 The Syrian involvement of the US has never been for anything other American oil interests’ greed.
The US has little interest in the people of Syria, they also fear Iran, and cheers to rejecting the demands.

4925 2018-08-29 14:25:20 No they aren't compounded. 3.6% over 15 years has same effect as $10 rise in oil price, which fluctuates all the time by way more than that.
Per capita GDP regularly changes by double figures annually. You call me deluded? You are clueless.

4932 2018-08-29 14:24:43 Bloody all the politicians hiding the actual fact from the public & since the officers are under them it's their duty to support the politicians. The international crud oil price should be displayed daily in newspapers so that public can be aware.

4937 2018-08-29 14:24:10 Very annoying! The Presidency tried all it could to divert attention from itself and made some misguided elements to throw stones at the National Assembly. Buhari has been Nigeria's problem for 3 years now
4938 2018-08-29 14:24:07 Also, u started supporting them after that arab oil money was pumped in! Least admit that and then move on. Simple really
4939 2018-08-29 14:24:03 Awesome. I did get some really good oil paints on Amazon via “Amazon Warehouse” a while back for cheap. I always forget about eBay and Michaels! Will definitely check them out! Thanks!!

4945 2018-08-29 14:23:03 No, Trans Mountain does not carry "bitumen". It carries oil and refined products.

Also, you do realise natural gas is transported by big, scary pipelines too, right?

4952 2018-08-29 14:22:26 @lekealder said in one of his #Illuminaire (not his exact words) that though the oil industry is a great contributor to GDP; it does not employ so large a population of Nigeria.
4953 2018-08-29 14:22:17 I believe govt will complete it . So encourage them with d little oil price we have
4954 2018-08-29 14:22:07 Cooking eggs with butter and milk is the only way. Oil makes eggs taste so dull

4959 2018-08-29 14:21:05 Venezuela has oil
shocking to see the way business operates with high level collusion to install friendly (towards asset strippers) regimes
venezuela nationalised thir oil industry, I seem to recall
4960 2018-08-29 14:20:36 I’ll be home in about a hour. Getting my oil changed. And yeah there are some connectivity issues apparently since it’s overly cluttered with players
4961 2018-08-29 14:20:23 It pains my heart that @MBuhari is my President. He is a RETROGRESSIVE for rejecting the #PIGB. I encourage @nassnigeria to bypass him. Cc: @SPNigeria

4965 2018-08-29 14:20:13 2/ The infrastructure to keep California running with oil already exists in place. It just needs to be used. New ways of generating power require a massive investment in NEW infrastructure, in a state which has a poor record of managing money. #TrainToNowhere
4966 2018-08-29 14:20:04 I have received enough DMs that I feel like I must clarify something: 
I am NOT in possession of the exact recipe for Tyler Childers' frying batter. I do know that it involves canola oil, corn meal, egg and milk. I don't know how much. All apologies!
4967 2018-08-29 14:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4968 2018-08-29 14:19:40 But the process creates poisonous gas and bleaches fabric as you said.
Still very preferable for rubber though. No more powder or silicone oil to put it on

4970 2018-08-29 14:19:30 If you have more than you need why are you importing oil at all?  Is this money laundering?

4977 2018-08-29 14:19:05 Agree new infrastructure will help but 2017 volumes on par with 2015. Seems more like a systemic problem that industry struggles to address in gas rich oil fields.
4978 2018-08-29 14:19:04 plus on 24 it's always rich white oil guys and american weapons manufacturers funding the terrorists which would never play
4979 2018-08-29 14:18:58 Khartoum is in dire need of oil more than Juba who aim to purchase aremements while oppositions struglling to secure thier share from the national cake.
4980 2018-08-29 14:18:56 When did Russian oligarchs start contributing to GOP campaigns (Prof. Ruth May, @dallasnews ), later funneled through @NRA?  I’m not surprised  wanted oil sanctions relief &/or no war with HRC/MIC .  IMHO, GOP complicity is the problem.

4984 2018-08-29 14:18:22 Trinidad and Tobago should have NEVER had an oil refinery in the first place. We don't make enough of a dent in the global production of oil to warrant having a refinery...so I can't say that I'm even remotely surprised by the Government's decision.
4985 2018-08-29 14:18:21 I would need to oil all my joints. Would have kicked your ass 10 years ago though

4998 2018-08-29 14:16:22 But it shouldnt be a single narrative.Likely other technical reasons such as budgeting delays, & social ones such as increased urban migration to tap into service related sectors..will be interesting to correlate  contraction incidences to oil price levels & urban migration

5055 2018-08-29 14:10:32 Was in Ecuador recently..China drilling for oil in Amazon..Ecuador in debt to them for next 20 years!
Also, I previously read and liked and retweeted this thread and even discussed it. No indication of that which freaks me out! Maybe China hacked Twitter?

" nuclear power has long been a topic of debate, while many countries eager want to pursue nuclear power as a way to reduce their dependence on foreign oil and stop global warming, the current disaster at the local nuclear plants has forced them to re-consider.

5072 2018-08-29 14:08:56 Look at all the effort this guy is putting into making sure oil and coal industries make ungodly sums of money. We can do better as a species to protect the only planet we have and ensure it’s sustainability.

5085 2018-08-29 14:07:10 Maybe taking funds 5% from the Department of Defense.  That alone should provide over $30 billion a year to the education budget.  Or, perhaps from federal subsidies to big Oil.  There’s plenty of options to choose from.
5086 2018-08-29 14:06:59 Core is at 2.4% after a 100% rise in oil. Not sure I see your point.

5091 2018-08-29 14:06:51 Really? So paying market value for oil and gas without subsidies will not result in an increase in price?  Interesting. This I must see.

5095 2018-08-29 14:05:51 Bummer.  I've got one of those plastic tools too and I find a pair of pliers works better.   I also recommend getting some specialty guitar wood conditioner/oil and applying it to the fretboard and bridge before you restring .   It's good for the wood

But it's causing delays nearby and we are being asked to avoid the area if possible.

5113 2018-08-29 14:04:02 Yeah I just became aware of these papers last weekend; absurd you might have a totally different alcohol toxicity on a beef rather than seed oil diet.

Come to think of it we still had civilization in the 1850s when per-capita alcohol was thru the roof..did they tolerate it more?
5114 2018-08-29 14:03:52 They been breathing in too much olive oil

5117 2018-08-29 14:03:51 A bit harsh there. Yep I’m well down too but they have 3 oil wells on EWT and I’d expect news next week as T-39 will have had 60+ days and T-45 and Dino-2 many more as well as confirmation Niko is going down to zone 13. Frustrated too but hope good news is en route w/c 3rd Sept.
5118 2018-08-29 14:03:34 coconut oil first thing for sure
5119 2018-08-29 14:03:24 Agree- sounds a lot like the slogan of your local snake oil salesman- "Have I got a deal for you"... "A better deal".... this definitely calls for a new marketing firm...
5120 2018-08-29 14:03:20 Also, worsening of current account deficit because of higher oil prices kept the market sentiment lower.  The Rupee ended at 70.59 vs. yesterday’s close of 70.11.
5121 2018-08-29 14:03:18 Oil changed and brakes replaced before 10am time to roll up so I can sleep real good

5126 2018-08-29 14:02:42 Poor little Macron, ex-GolmanSachs corporate banking puppet, frustrated that Syria's central bank and oil reserves aren't  controlled by his friends at head office.
Macron has failed on behalf of his global banking cartel bosses - poor little Macron.
5127 2018-08-29 14:02:42 But did Congress make payment for that oil imported. Modi government has only recently made payment for oil imported during Congress rule. Now there is no oil subsidy meaning tax payer money is not funding oil consumption. Never mind you guys will never accept the truth.
5128 2018-08-29 14:02:41 Oil leak and I’m getting my transmission re done. Just stuff the dealer should’ve had done

Also there is a lot of garbage oil people are peddling on the market nowadays, make sure you’re getting a high quality oil. You can also get a medical marijuana card for stronger

5143 2018-08-29 14:01:04 Coincidence that you had an oil delivery this morning @EnvAgencySW?
5144 2018-08-29 14:01:00 True. Its because #Tripoli is the pie. Control the capital and you have pretty much everything you need unless the oil fields are closed.
5145 2018-08-29 14:00:59 For d oil!!!

5148 2018-08-29 14:00:41 Or the real killer, sounds disgusting but put a tbsp of unsalted butter in your coffee and throw that thing into a Ninja blender bottle with about a tablespoon of coconut oil to. Freaking fantastic.

5154 2018-08-29 14:00:11 Yep let's go back to Harper and his 183 billion dollars of debt. Letting foreign interests buy the rights to our oil. I'm sure Harper would be bent over selling Canada to the US part and parcel just like Conservatives have always done.

5161 2018-08-29 13:59:44 I understand hot showers feel amazing, soothing and good for those achy morning pains but it damages your skin as it’s very drying, you’ll need to dip yourself in olive oil after your hot shower to replenish the lost moisture. #SkincareTip
5162 2018-08-29 13:59:38 Why not put even just some focus on your hydraulic fracturing pause sense 2013, Newfoundland government has double standards when it comes to oil and gas.
5163 2018-08-29 13:59:36 Try CBD oil (doesn’t give any sort of high), it relaxes me when I am stressed. But if you have slept unwell and you are stressed for that reason then the best advice is too rest and recover even just 1-2 hours...! :)

5168 2018-08-29 13:59:01 I bet  "taking their oil"  is a Trump idea.
5169 2018-08-29 13:58:49 so both are to blame for the situation. It's a mutual enforcing destruction force, as can be witnessed in other oil rich countries with weak governance (i.e. Nigeria, South-Sudan)
5170 2018-08-29 13:58:48 Yeah I’m in the U.S. so thankfully no dairy but what’s the deal with palm oil? I’m gonna do some research but I had no idea it was controversial
5171 2018-08-29 13:58:42 Update #2 : Got NO sleep at all last night , but trying to fly through the day. Lots of driving to do ! Gonna have to do an oil change soon..#HumpDayTroubles #3DayWeekendComingUp

5176 2018-08-29 13:58:22 on the bright side if this heat wave continues i'm pretty sure my forehead will be able to supply the entire world with oil indefinitely
5177 2018-08-29 13:58:20 Sunny always gets infections idk if it's the same tho but he gets really itchy and keeps scratching and it smells so I put olive oil to help w dryness then hydrocortisone and a lil neosporin it helps him
5178 2018-08-29 13:58:12 They do. Just not nearly as many, and they spread out easier in Fort Collins than Boulder where there is a high concentration of trustifarians. Boulder reeks of patchouli oil where Fort Collins is fine as long as Greely isn’t blowing in.
5179 2018-08-29 13:58:07 Hi! Could you please tell me why to avoid palm oil? I haven’t heard of this before and I want to do all I can to help animals and the planet.

5181 2018-08-29 13:58:01 OIL: Oil prices steadied, supported by news of a fall in Iranian crude supplies as U.S. sanctions deter buyers, but held back by evidence of a rise in U.S. inventories.
5182 2018-08-29 13:57:55 If you understood how flares work you would understand how stupid you sound , all excess hydrocarbons get burned off through a low pressure or high pressure flare for the safety of the refineries /oil rigs

5192 2018-08-29 13:57:16 Hahaha ng buhok?  Ano? sachet ng extra virgin coconut oil..like that nuh?
5193 2018-08-29 13:57:08 I'd love to be positive but more profitable low volume supercars isn't going to do it, especially when the only way that might happen is increasing the cost of imports, and goods traded in USD, like oil.
5194 2018-08-29 13:56:59 Ugh I have oil stains on my fucking shirt today
5195 2018-08-29 13:56:50 ...when they sell out of the geometry kits and you go back and buy the one with the wrong sized protractor or the one in hectares instead of ounces and go back again and forget the scientific calculator that graphs instead of spells SHELL OIL upside-down...
5196 2018-08-29 13:56:48 I have no idea what I'm looking at.  All I'm concerned about is how much oil is there.
5197 2018-08-29 13:56:28 حضرتك من سكان المدينة؟
5198 2018-08-29 13:56:24 "Take their oil?"
5199 2018-08-29 13:56:14 The shit just cut off while I was driving lol but then when I got to the dealership they were like ma’am I should’ve gotten a oil change a while ago. So it’s my fault 
5200 2018-08-29 13:56:14 St. John the Beloved! He was the only one that died of natural causes. Though fried in oil, he had an incredible housemate and went on to write some good things!
5201 2018-08-29 13:56:08 I remember seeing that the highway collapsed and cars were trapped between.  Seems much worst to me than tornados BUT thanks to capitalism and oil fracking Oklahoma has many earthquakes but their smaller. So we get both these days .
5202 2018-08-29 13:56:03 Hercules castor oil?
5203 2018-08-29 13:56:02 ماشفنا شي من ذا كله؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
5204 2018-08-29 13:55:55 Shouldn’t it be Evoo?

5214 2018-08-29 13:54:19 Using refinery simulation models, Statoil Bakken has the lowest yield of Kero/Diesel/Fuel Oil in the 40-45 api range. EF is a bit better on the statoil general assay but the actual EF assays we have received are lower. Permian assays like wti are all over the place.
5215 2018-08-29 13:53:50 @Robynlawley I just saw you on Meghan Kelly’s morning show and you are beautiful inside and out. My sister has lupus so I know how much she suffers with it. I just started her on Kannaway gold applicator of CBD oil to help with her symptoms?  Have you ever thought of using CBD?
5216 2018-08-29 13:53:29 I’ve always fried mine in a skillet. Heat oil to med-high heat, fry each side until brown (3-5 mins). They won’t dry out if you fry them properly. The fry should seal it up. Don’t use cold meat, it messes with the oil temp and you will get over cooked, dry, oily & crumbly cakes.
5217 2018-08-29 13:53:27 I dropped my car off this morning for an oil change and walked 5 blocks to this restaurant. I done sat here and ate all this damn food and forgot I gotta walk back  man!
5218 2018-08-29 13:53:23 Hahaha it's ok it'll gone soon, i guess as we get old we dont feel/ notice the smol pain i often get splash of hot oil but i just stare at it like it's nothing

5233 2018-08-29 13:52:12 Exactly. Horse racing, like life, is inherently unequal, and the free market dictates all. Entities that attempt to manipulate or deny that reality may find themselves like Venezuela- in complete turmoil despite sitting on the world's largest oil reserve.
5234 2018-08-29 13:52:09 Hold it right there!!! Buying which oil? I'm telling you it was a one way deal... When BUBU was asked during the press briefing about crude sale, do u know what his response was? Get urself a clip and see for yourself
5235 2018-08-29 13:52:05 @LouBachrodtAuto If you’re in a rush don’t come here for an oil change

5239 2018-08-29 13:51:47 You mean everything Obama started and carried 90% of the way, which he continued?
Because regulations trump undid, were put in place after suffering tragedies like the recession, BP oil spill, and many others.. 
Stock, jobs, and unemployment were all going up when he took office.
5240 2018-08-29 13:51:43 Took an hour and fifteen minutes to get oil changed I was the first one there this morning
5241 2018-08-29 13:51:31 well i was going to get my oil changed before work but now i woke up late

5244 2018-08-29 13:51:12 Wow!  Fed response to Puerto Rico?  Okay, how about 0bama's response to the gulf oil spill--they had to pull him off the golf course after 3 wks. ICE is doing their job w/o much support from Leftist politicians.  The EPA firings... are far from enough!  We need a smaller govt.
5245 2018-08-29 13:51:08 We all do,but taxation and revenues from oil,leave them net contributors to the Exchequer. The English will tell you different but they're liars!
5246 2018-08-29 13:50:53 They tried that on me until I told them my car doesn’t have one never went back there again another place left the drain plug loose didn’t fasten the air filter housing back down and overfilled the engine because they didn’t drain all the oil

5251 2018-08-29 13:50:31 Why would a oil based economy want Trump elected?  They wouldn’t.
5252 2018-08-29 13:50:25 Daniel it’s all vinegar all the time, ain’t no party like a Greek vinegar party ‘cause we dump oil and vinegar on EVERYTHING.
5253 2018-08-29 13:49:58 An analogy: Norway extracts oil and sells it to others who burn it. Should Norway get full responsibility or the country that burns it? What 'should' happen is that they both have some responsibility for this chain of events. Land clearance often isn't just about livestock.
5254 2018-08-29 13:49:50 Tofu is amazing. You can do anything with it. Pop whatever spices you want with a bit of oil in a pan, let them infuse, then fry up the Tofu. Thing of beauty.

5257 2018-08-29 13:49:13 Dropping the car off for an oil change, new tires and an alignment at noon.  And my coworker is going to follow me and take me home.
5258 2018-08-29 13:49:12 our own screw up with limited ocean access pipelines means that we are forced to accept whatever the americans offer for our oil. No tidewater access means no options. we pay world price for imported oil and accept pennies on the dollar to sell to the us.
5259 2018-08-29 13:48:54 Go after the little miniature Trump who wants to get rid of SSI social security Medicare Medicaid very bigotry will sell out Florida's coastlines 2 Big Oil will cut education funds and try to privatize just like Trump trying to privatize our military DeSantis is a Russian backer

5290 2018-08-29 13:45:50 Agree! theres a great deal this oped fails to take into consideration-including oil prices. How about the fact that in August China switched to using exclusively Iranian tankers for oil delivery? Or the Iran-Iraq oil exchange? Its not nearly as clear cut as they make it seem

5315 2018-08-29 13:42:44 No you are wrong Harsha..During 2013 when crude oil price was $150/- barrel India sold it to end customer at Rs 70 when it is now $50 - 60/- barrel now we are selling it at Rs 83-85 where are the margins gettng absrbd. 

BTW the actual cost of Import of petrol aftr al taxes is 30
5316 2018-08-29 13:42:41 Yes. I’ve tried explaining how D-list Trump was in NY for years; he was a funny racist uncle that no one took seriousky. All the more painful when people who normally would oppose his style, fell hook, line, and sinker for his snake oil.
5317 2018-08-29 13:42:33 @cleanandclear Although I have oily skin, I moisturize year round. I’m officially hooked on Dual Action oil free moisturizer! It leaves my face tingly & soft. Since I’ve been using it I haven’t had a single blemish. In summer, when my skin’s extra oily!

5321 2018-08-29 13:41:36 They imposed sanctions on weapons and oil, but not wider sanctions which they thought would hit black South Africans hardest, and lead to a bunker mentality, making progress less likely. You can disagree about which approach was most likely to succeed, but it is outrageously 1/

5328 2018-08-29 13:41:11 When I read a marxist claiming pollution is the fault of capitalism I think of the large oil spills by (gulp) socialist PDVSA @Monotonist
5329 2018-08-29 13:40:59 Data is oil
Lets repeat
5330 2018-08-29 13:40:54 coconut oil im in love with you
5331 2018-08-29 13:40:51 The only thing that makes me feel more accomplished than getting an early morning oil change, is the sound of emptying the trash on my laptop.
5332 2018-08-29 13:40:40 There's a closed group on Facebook selling CBD Oil that you can vape for €50. 
Or you can go onto the website they order it from and get it for €12.
Greedy bastards
5333 2018-08-29 13:40:36 What's important is the shift in message. It's become about relative minimal harm instead of beer as medicine. Now it is easier to spot the snake oil salesmen when they retweet PR about how healthy beer is.
5334 2018-08-29 13:40:32 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
5335 2018-08-29 13:40:25 Have you tried @Olverum oil? It clears every cold / flu I have, works absolute wonders! X
5336 2018-08-29 13:40:25 These are amazing products, I'm yet to try the bath oil but I'm sure it won't be long! I think I'm slightly addicted to @asbotanicals

5338 2018-08-29 13:40:14 I damn sure cooked everything with hash oil when my other nigga was the plug... breakfast, lunch, and dinner was always cannabis infused 
5339 2018-08-29 13:40:07 personally i used to eat food (mostly vegetables) with a lot of olive oil, i have noticed a good change in my mood, my morning breath also disappeared, i found out later that olive oil restores the gut flora.
5340 2018-08-29 13:39:59 The pharaohs had audit and taxed cooking oil as I recall.
5341 2018-08-29 13:39:18 Kho tou dola baby oil?
5342 2018-08-29 13:39:09 So wait...the oil company is closing down, so how Trinidad gonna make money? I kinda confused
5343 2018-08-29 13:38:58 I hate how nothing was wrong with my car.. get an oil change now it acts up and the mechanic tries to play me like “it’s coincidental” welp fix it and stop fuckig playing with me ain’t no coincidence
5344 2018-08-29 13:38:58 Hopee oil
5345 2018-08-29 13:38:55 Coconut oil is from Jesus himself
5346 2018-08-29 13:38:55 But it wouldn't apply to oil produced OUTSIDE Canada.  So Quebec and the Maritimes could continue to buy oil on the international market, while Western Canada pays more tax.  And NOTHING changes from a climate perspective.
5347 2018-08-29 13:38:42 Getting an oil change and here comes a salesman “you wanna buy a new car this morning”, SIR I drive a 2016 Impala I am fine my car model is still out there on your lot 
5348 2018-08-29 13:38:33 I wonder,they're even putting us to shame,we that support PMB without bitterness.
5349 2018-08-29 13:38:28 @vangoghmuseum - Massively disappointing that you have decided to end its collaboration with Shell - To have no back-bone to stand up to people who challenge the oil and gas industry that has and does provide a fundamental of the Worlds Energy needs.

5350 2018-08-29 13:38:24 Coconut oil my hair super greasy at the roots and desert dry at the ends... Coconut oil has not been good for myself or family when used topically
5351 2018-08-29 13:38:18 They pick up CBD oil in Colorado and don’t know how to properly take it. We also don’t know the purity or dose of what they buy. Many physicans, even some neurologists, don’t know how to take care of pts on CBD oil.
5352 2018-08-29 13:38:13 How delightful - the address is the lounge cafe 113 Chalkhill road Wembley Ha99fx - thanks a bazillion xxxx.
5353 2018-08-29 13:38:10 Adulting is going in for a $45 oil change at 7am on a Wednesday so you're not late for work and walking out being told you need two new tires, all new brake pads, and it'll only cost you a small fee of $760, which is more than half of your bi-weekly paycheck.
5354 2018-08-29 13:38:03 Crude Oil Prices Eye Inventory Data, Gold May Fall on US GDP: Crude oil prices have stalled as the focus turns to EIA inventory flow data. Gold prices may decline if updated US GDP data keeps Fed rate hike prospects in focus.

5361 2018-08-29 13:37:19 They imposed sanctions on weapons and oil, but opposed broader sanctions on the basis that they would hurt black South Africans the most and would encourage a bunker mentality in the South African government, making progress less likely.

5363 2018-08-29 13:37:11 Suggestions for an aluminum free deodorant for a man?!? No essential oil Concoctions or anything please. I need it to resemble deodorant lol
5364 2018-08-29 13:37:10 I just assumed it was a dry patch but it might just be catching on my larger pores. Since it works mixed with my moisturizer, I assumed I do need more hydration with this foundation perhaps. Maybe I'll try a facial oil as a "primer" next time.
5365 2018-08-29 13:37:02 There was disillusionment under Blair because of the war. Yes he did good things, we must not forget that but it all went wrong when he was so influenced by Bush. (It was always about oil) Like it or not, the only hope we have to get rid of the 'stain of blue' is to vote red.
5366 2018-08-29 13:36:59 His campaign won’t admit it, but Senator Bill Nelson’s camp was smiling after @AndrewGillum came out on top. There’s a mutual dependence each will have to attract particular voters to the polls & combat the gobs of dirty $$$ that will flow over Florida’s shores like an oil spill.
5367 2018-08-29 13:36:51 Lol ,are you not ashamed of posting this? A handful of individuals,hired to waste their time for a thousand bucks to prove nonsense on our National stadium Turf,just imagine, I wonder who approved the misuse of this facility.
5368 2018-08-29 13:36:49 @JohnKasich whi is CBD oil illegal all of a sudden. It's been sold in smoke shops for about 2 or 3 years. Now that we are getting closer to medical marijuana being instituted, your admin. Wants to stick its hands further into the pot. It's not illegal federally, yet you want
5369 2018-08-29 13:36:49 Pish oil pls hays
5370 2018-08-29 13:36:34 And Coconut oil does not do anything for my skin or hair! ..but tastes amazing in #Anguamo #Ghdelicacies #essentialoils #coconutoil
5371 2018-08-29 13:36:24 CBD oil doesn’t resolve all seizures and needs to be taken with other meds. CBD oil can affect levels of other seizure drugs leading to serious side effects or ineffective low drug levels. We already have issues with pts not taking CBD oil correctly.
5372 2018-08-29 13:36:24 Went to get an oil change and they’re telling me how bad my car is and I’m like yep yep I’ll tell my dad 
5373 2018-08-29 13:36:10 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
5374 2018-08-29 13:35:57 They would be softer targets than the other countries, so maybe it's the attitude of their inhabitants in the sense that they are more welcoming to these refugees. But bear in mind these people would not be homeless only for the greed of countries like the US who are there 4 oil.

5377 2018-08-29 13:35:44 i hope i can nap in between the oil change, the grocery shopping, the packing, the picking up my daughter from school, the cooking, the moving, & see my dad for a bit ALL before trying to make it to emo night tonight...

5379 2018-08-29 13:35:38 Kerrygold Butter (unsalted) on your vegetables, cook with Coconut Oil, and save all the stock from your cooked meats to use for later. Eat a meal with any of those and drink tons of water and you gone feel like a balloon rest of the day 
5380 2018-08-29 13:35:37 My pharmacist friend at @wholesomerx sells an outstanding "eczema balm" formulated from all essential oils - if you call he can ship to you. We've used on our kids it works! Otherwise, Oat bath/aveeno, tea tree oil, aloe vera, and of course, turmeric (comes in essential oil).

5385 2018-08-29 13:34:44 The power he has now who did it"epp"? Should it be about what is good for the country or what power Buhari as person wields? Whatever power he is protecting is a short-term compared to the country.

5389 2018-08-29 13:34:04 The US press can’t stop talking about the sacrifices of US soldiers who fight US wars for oil and other resources and to protect and advance capitalist greed, but it can’t even begin to talk about the suffering and death they inflict on the people of the countries they  devastate
5390 2018-08-29 13:33:55 So around 20TWh over 20 years. Undiscounted (discounted would be higher, but a cheap trick to account for longer duration) €150 to 450/MWh.
I am sure they can do better :)
They also probably meant 0.25mmMT of oil a year, not bad
Nice project, please let them do it cheaper
5391 2018-08-29 13:33:47 Do you have to top-up the engine oil in your car more frequently than you should? Does your car emit black smoke from its exhaust? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, then you need your engine checked or replaced.
5392 2018-08-29 13:33:44 @NelsonWittwer @theBGarrett One of the populations that could benefit from marijuana, specifically CBD oil, is the epilepsy population. As of now, the only type of epilepsy CBD oil has been found to be useful is lennox gastaut.

5395 2018-08-29 13:33:23 I didn't say we were bot investigating dark money. We've broken important stories on this developing issue. Do you make a habit of lecturing other professions? Perhaps you tell your doctor she's wrong or your mechanic that your car doesn't need oil. Wise up.
5396 2018-08-29 13:33:15 @ndtv team pls telecast ths oil price hike..... We are in the top position for oil price hiking

5401 2018-08-29 13:32:46 Buharideen are now saying that Kwankwaso orchestrated the blockade at the national stadium and denied himself entrance. The way APC hits new lows every week you would think they were an oil drilling firm instead of a political party.

5419 2018-08-29 13:31:12 Venezuela was one of the poorest countries in America when the oil profits went to the USA. After nationalising the oil sector it slowly became the richest. Then sanctions and oil prices conspired. Instead of importing food with that money they should have built a food industry.

5421 2018-08-29 13:30:58 So what wrong with petrotrin shutting down and then an international, profitable company leasing the facility to refine oil locally? People will get jobs.  And things will be more efficient. The stupidness was bound to end.

5428 2018-08-29 13:30:26 More than 50 percent of the oil price goes to center and state taxes . It is much wiser for the govt to put this under GST and see the retail prices of oil come down by atleast 10 to 15 rupees per liter . However who will bell the cat since elections are round the corner

ただ…最高速はOILに左右される事がわかってます。エンジンに纏わりついて保護するパノリンは落ちた一方、リキモリは最高速更新しました。

5448 2018-08-29 13:28:14 I wonder why the Mayor forgot to tell that she is throwing a party-concert to “celébrate” Hurricane Maria’s first anniversary. She also failed to tell you, that the foreign aid blocked by Homeland  was a dirty oil ship from narcodictator Maduro, sent by  at her request.

5490 2018-08-29 13:22:45 the short-sightedness of this is almost impressive. The Midland differential is setting records, natural gas has nowhere to go, and still the industry drills on. The oil has been there for 100 million years. Couldn't we wait another year or two to let infrastructure catch up?

5534 2018-08-29 13:17:20 Honestly, Kelly, your face would glow more and seem less sallow if you ate healthy foods with extra virgin olive oil added. Freshly extracted vegetable juice helps stamina. Cheeks should be naturally plumped by nutrition. Find a nutrionist who likes "organic."

5539 2018-08-29 13:16:59 To be fair, it has a fair few characteristics of a planet. It has an atmosphere, rivers and lakes. Only thing is that the rivers, lakes and rain are all liquid methane and water there is as hard as rocks.
So why oil tycoons aren't all over the idea of space travel, I've no idea!

5597 2018-08-29 13:09:54 It is not myopia. It is the fact on ground. If they tell you now, you will still look for excuses. With the fall of oil prices, the economy of a mono product like Nigeria will nose dive. Previous Govt could not pay salary without borrowing as at 2014. Now Nig economy is growing

5601 2018-08-29 13:09:20 Buhari is elected as president of Nigeria not a minister of petroleum. PIGB is meant to whittle down the power and corruption in oil and gas industry but I'm dissapointed that Buhari witheld it assent.

You may not know our ecology minister just slammed the door of the government 1 day ago, and he is as "green" as starbucks (which means not very much).

5607 2018-08-29 13:08:45 18. – All other 3 bills have reached advanced stage of passage, and very critical to oil and gas investments in Nigeria, especially the fiscal bill. They will also be dealt huge blow. I think this is sad news for the petroleum industry not just in Nigeria, but globally.
5608 2018-08-29 13:08:36 China cannot afford a war with its biggest customer. All oil imports by sea will be stopped. Trillions in loans to 3rd world countries will be in default. And China’s military has never fought a war...on the job training will prove fatal.

5613 2018-08-29 13:08:06 Precisely that PH #inflation very sensitive/elastic to oil prices, #Dutertenomics shd have not imposed that huge oil excise tax hike. We saw it last Jan 2018. Now Jan 2019 is near, part 2 of oil tax hikes, another inflationary pressure even if world oil prices stabilize. @DOF_PH

5622 2018-08-29 13:06:49 Midland is blended with shale oil that has no middle distillate. No diesel on backside of refinery. Margins not as good. @Big_Orrin can explain the details, or you can see them in his previous info.
5623 2018-08-29 13:06:48 Yes it talked about how Texas used to outpace California in job growth but has since been passed by California. Also Texas is reliant too much on oil while California is reliant on tech which where substantial growth is still happening.

5625 2018-08-29 13:06:14 MSc Oil and Gas Management, do a project management course, HSE like NEBOSH/IOSH. 

Also maybe a professional HR course, and take that line in since you already have a HR background. 

Or get chartered in Tax.

- cut politician pay
- cut gov spending

- only use oil/external revenue for welfare
- tax code to attract business
- remove income tax #belanjawan2019

5794 2018-08-29 12:46:57 A oil change will have your car riding soooooo much better.
5795 2018-08-29 12:46:43 I promise! It expels toxins! A good bath is Epsom salts, a few drops of lavender oil, and baking soda.

5801 2018-08-29 12:45:46 Well CBD oil is legal in all states w/I prescription, so I’m thinking it’s not.
5802 2018-08-29 12:45:38 เหมือนเมเบอลีนเลย ถ้า made in china ก็แย่หน่อย แต่กระปุกนีเวียที่เพิ่งออกใหม่ก็น่าลองนะ อันที่ไม่ได้อิมพอร์ตจากเยอรมันที่ชอบก็ที่เป็น lotion in oil

5810 2018-08-29 12:45:21 I don’t add oil because it makes the pasta slippery and the sauce doesn’t coat it as well, but using it is a minor infraction. ;)

5815 2018-08-29 12:44:31 Are they also going to shut down all their oil wells?
5816 2018-08-29 12:44:27 I’m going to do some research on CBD oil. I have friends who swear by it. I have bad knees, but not to the replacement stage. But if I walk a lot, OH BOY - hurt city when I finally relax.

5836 2018-08-29 12:43:09 Oil is pumped in Texas and sent out of state for refining mainly and then trucked back in.  Houston does not have the lowest gas prices.
5837 2018-08-29 12:43:03 Reason being the industrial revolution and widespread use of coal and oil to power industry. That's why.
5838 2018-08-29 12:43:00 Sounds like an oil company apology. Exxon or BP, maybe?
5839 2018-08-29 12:42:48 Yes, because of course Scotland discovered the oil all on its own.  No ‘British' help whatsoever...

They told us that they will diverse the economy, they said there is nothing like subsidy, they told us that they will build modular refineries, everything is lie. Don't sign, Ewu.

5879 2018-08-29 12:37:23 The President does not want to "whittle down" his power, Military men from Buhari's generation can never see Nigeria beyond the oil. This is why we should have avoided him and it's why we must vote him out for a much younger, credible candidate ready for reforms

5891 2018-08-29 12:36:13 Nope. He and McStain were the “Righteous Duo”. Both non-stop provoking/promoting the Syrian war to overthrow Assad at Killary’s bidding. Remember the “moderate rebels” they said we needed to fund & arm? Soon, we came to know them as ISIS. All for an oil pipeline. So many died.

5896 2018-08-29 12:35:32 How about you force Mexico not to back out on deals? Many businesses in my own town are going to die because you need to do your job and make Mexico pay for American contracted work before you make another deal. That off shore oil rig can't be used for US companies

Coconut oil is the best carrier for cannabinoids,it allows up to 3x better absorption than cannabis extract alone or with inferior oils. It is more expensive though so companies selling crap oil say it’s bad. Not true

5999 2018-08-29 12:22:10 Yes. Basis differentials are the evidence. If the same barrel of oil (42 deg API) is $20/b more expensive when located in Houston vs Midland, it can only be because there’s no room in pipes to ship it.

6065 2018-08-29 12:14:16 Any way to calculate the cost of running all those air conditioners versus the income from selling that amount of oil?
6066 2018-08-29 12:14:11 Yes, and there in lies the problem. Blending higher API shale oil with lower API conv oil (to meet contract specs) gives you dumbbell crude no refiners want. Shale has no mid dist (diesel), blending does not change this. Contract specs change jan 19

6072 2018-08-29 12:13:48 How often should you wash your hair? Regularly, according to the principal scientist at Head & Shoulders, it is a myth that over washing hair dries it out by stripping the natural oils. In fact, allowing oil & dirt to build up on the scalp can lead to scalp problems. #hair

My pores are slathered in the oil of an unholy anointing
Everything smells of mildew

6083 2018-08-29 12:12:10 For me, the oil is just a personal preference, not a requirement (and reflection of one's upbringing) like the salt ;)

I use the oil to keep the pasta from sticking together...probably because I make too much at once!
6084 2018-08-29 12:12:08 Oh so true... oil field guys exemplify the “eat, drink and be merry because tomorrow we may die” way of life

6090 2018-08-29 12:11:27 Well. And then their sole source of income dried up when the price of oil plummeted. So, whoever runs the government runs on empty. But if you want to see a true example, compare Kansas and Nebraska.
6091 2018-08-29 12:11:23 I mean, medical marijuana will be legal next month so I’m sure CBD oil will have to be available again by then. The rule basically says now it has to be sold by a dispensary not just like a health food store.
6092 2018-08-29 12:10:46 She was using a cream. I thought she use pure but I was wrong. Pure olive oil does help with hair growth and itcy dry scalp. I dont think the cream does.

6128 2018-08-29 12:04:55 Shipping oil was challenging because the primary insurers for these ships were the US and the UK. It's likely the US-insured ships are choosing new ports, but the UK ones will see an opening. This could have an impact, but it may also be temporary as companies adjust.

You can find indica that is 85% thc and 15% cbd. It works very well for sleeping . Stativa works also but you'll be awake for a little bit chillin wanting to watch TV for a little bit before you knock out.

6154 2018-08-29 12:01:38 Hmmm it took over 60 years from the days of President Eisenhower but I guess the Venezuelan Nationalization of American Oil companies with chants of Yankee Go Home have resulted in collapse of Venezuela’s Economy and YANKEE COME BACK as thousands flee Venezuela.

6182 2018-08-29 11:58:08 As EVs grow, oil demand will fall, and the 5.9bn kWh we use (UK) will fall. That capacity goes into cars directly and more efficiently. Our grid operator have stated we need no new power plants if we replaced half the UKs car fleet with EVs overnight.

6272 2018-08-29 11:42:52 I kept seeing comments last week on #Gers "Tell me how a small oil rich nation has a deficit of £13bn"
6273 2018-08-29 11:42:45 SK scholars, experts in foreign relation, X-professors, retired soldiers, ordinary ppl.. list goes on. They're fighting against Moon's policies. They're demanding stronger US alliance, stop importing oil from Iran... and many more. But every Moon's policy has been disaster so far
6274 2018-08-29 11:41:58 Lol what’s there to talk about the team we thought we were going to have is finally showing their colors and our manager is showing he’s just a centerfold for coconut oil... put a fork in em!

6277 2018-08-29 11:41:39 SI CON LA EXPLOTACION, PRODUCCION Y COMERCIALIZACION DE LOS PRODUCTOS O RIQUEZAS GENERADAS X PIB, NO SE DIVERSIFICA LA ECONOMIA VENEZOLANA, SEGUIREMOS VULNERABLES DEPENDENDO HASTA DE LA IMPORTACIÓN DE 1TORNILLO PARA COLGAR LAS LLAVES EN LA PARED. BASAMOS NUESTRA ECONOMÍA EN OIL

6288 2018-08-29 11:40:38 Indian regulators’ indecision on GM mustard has nothing to do with science but all politics, not having the courage to do the right thing to help its farmers & cut billions of dollars in vegetable oil imports, but caving to anti-science anti-progress fringe voices
6289 2018-08-29 11:40:37 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
6290 2018-08-29 11:40:37 The question to ask is not whether the IGB whittles down the power of the President or Minster of petroleum but if it is good for Nigeria and reduces corruption in the oil and gas sector.
6291 2018-08-29 11:40:22 The Crowd sourcing that the good rep does is called taxes!! Quit the politics and do your job governance of the people. Big Tax breaks for oil and gas, bad lottery deal and the rich get richer while another generation of less fortunate suffer to get out of the vicious cycle!

6301 2018-08-29 11:38:47 The jar is as important as the oil inside. The package is as important as the content. Take care of your unique, exclusive and priceless internal and external endowments.
6302 2018-08-29 11:38:46 Is that because it made you realize that you're honoring a war monger who sent many young Americans to die, while bombing foreign children for oil?

6315 2018-08-29 11:37:04 I made a transaction in January to IQoption, it was reversed. Never went through. But I had no idea IQOption is considered forex, because its an options trading entity, you can trade oil on it too. Eitherway, the transaction was reversed and I never really traded, still blocked.

6321 2018-08-29 11:35:53 How did the President (Buhari) manage the Petroleum Trust Fund entrusted to him as the Chairman? He was part of the Oil Boom the Vice President was referring to.
6322 2018-08-29 11:35:43 Is this corporate job at a fish cannery?  I work at a fragrance, flavor, essential oil factory... the building can be beautiful and refreshing one day and hideous what the heck are we making the next.
6323 2018-08-29 11:35:39 LMAO! R u aware of a President that said”if you like ur Dr. U can keep ur Dr.”?”The spontaneous attack on Benghazi annex was a result of a you tube video”?” “keystone pipeline is 4 oil that bypasses the US” all LIES told 2 Americans by OBAMA Y didn’t menos get recorded for him?
6324 2018-08-29 11:35:35 I guess there's no impetus to cry over from any media output that a busload of children were killed by a Saudi led missile strike in Yemen by American backed hardware. Must be oil in Yemen to extract.
6325 2018-08-29 11:35:29 What is this I am hearing about the PIGB and the reason for withholding assent by the Presidency. Isn't the development of stonger institutions in the oil and gas sector one of the reasons we proposed the Bill in the first place?

6363 2018-08-29 11:29:48 WRT voluntary shut-ins and talking off the top of my head, might you not be able to shut-in the gassiest wells which, on the whole, would be older and have lower oil production? Given that it's a %age cap.

6379 2018-08-29 11:27:37 that is, where we see the Gov ABDICATE its DUTY to protect TAXPAYERS on both the FRONT and BACK END, i.e., due to the GOP COLLUSION with the Oil & Gas industry?

What happens when FL is next to fall? Will the Gov again do nothing?

It's time for COINED STIMULUS to fund repairs.

6385 2018-08-29 11:26:00 Clogged pores are the result of dead skin cells getting trapped in your skin instead of being shed into the environment. Pores are tiny openings in the skin that release oil and sweat. When pores are clogged, it can result in blackheads, whiteheads, and #acne.

6549 2018-08-29 11:04:22 I am blown away by  how brain washed you dems/libs have become. You are ignorant sheep with a victim mentality. You bought all the goods the snake oil salesman had. Hey I got a bridge for sale, it's real nice! Hahaha
6550 2018-08-29 11:04:20 Before the oil deal, did you see the slingshot move under Earnhardt to get the lead back real quick? Saw Dale do that alot later. Wonder if Dale learned it there?
6551 2018-08-29 11:04:17 That’s right but they don’t get a say whether they get to remain in the country when the ‘Civil War’ has officially come to its end. #Syria won’t give them a share of oil contracts so they’ve got nothing else to do but continue threatening & attacking or rightfully leaving.

Every stride Anambra is making as a state is thanks to his ANIDS policy and we're not an oil producing state o.

6637 2018-08-29 10:49:50 As per the Law of Entropy, the only way to have economic expansion is energy abundance.

For US and the world to have economic expansion, crude oil would have to be hovering at around $20 per barrell for a sustained period in order to achieve economic expansion.
6638 2018-08-29 10:49:36 We can achieve a palm oil supply chain where the environment is protected and workers are thriving. Now the challenge lays in raising awareness of the impact of a boycott and encouraging consumers to ask brands to source sustainable palm oil.

6689 2018-08-29 10:42:25 Is it really about whittling down his power or on national interest? #PIGB should see the light of the day. If he rejects it by veto then the National Assembly should do the needful by passing it into law by two-third majority of her members.

6693 2018-08-29 10:41:56 @gmc @mtbarra instead of build a truck with a tailgate that opens 112 different ways, what about concentrate on building a better product! The fact it will be acceptable that the same truck will use 5 quarts of oil I between oil changes proves lack of quality, just gimmicks!

6701 2018-08-29 10:40:22 Yes. In that case the global decision (which you might not agree with) has been to pick renewables over oil. If the State wants to revert that choice it should do so at the global level, not by giving exemptions to single firms.

A. The fact that the question can even be asked is reason enough to stop Brexit.

6886 2018-08-29 10:05:36 Be wise enough to talk sense.The prices of petrol,diseal etc fluctuates as per OPEC.Therefore increasing or slicing of rates depends upon the outcome of decision of oil producing countries.I am also sufferer but that does not mean that I will blame the Govt.

It helps to diminish the appearance of pores so skin looks more refined. It is recommended for combination to oily skin and contains oil absorbing mineral powder to control shine and leave a matte finish.

Secondly, commonsense should tell anyone that a country of about 200million people would definitely have 87million poor people (the largest anywhere in the world) if her leaders had wasted $992 billion oil proceeds between 1990-2015.

6953 2018-08-29 09:47:58 On the list for quite a while to purchase. Although, I just use a small cast iron pan to make these. Super delicious. Olive oil, egg, a dollop of any pesto lying around. maybe a few slices of chilli or chilli flakes

Despite the oil price shock, did every OPEC member go into recession?

7245 2018-08-29 08:48:19 please use anger and talk sense into them..i initially thought this only happened in the oil communities..cant let this madness to spread
7246 2018-08-29 08:48:18 Remember Standing Rock? There won’t be any leakage and we are all crazy to protest? 200,000 gallons of oil spilled later and now my home state is terrorizing water protectors who fight against this!

7250 2018-08-29 08:47:26 Ok,uve given me a clearer understanding of the PIGB. Which makes it more sad that the president has refused to sign it. One would think it wud be an opportunity for the failed @OfficialAPCNg to use 2 appease the SS,n claim accolades. Dumb wits
7251 2018-08-29 08:47:09 The anointed does not come without pressing.  Press past the pain into your praise.  Jesus said we can do it. The olive is pressed to get the anointing oil. Christ is the anointed!
7252 2018-08-29 08:46:50 Absolutely. It's high time Russia became more assertive! Not least, to throw NATO's illegal occupying forces out of Syria. US continues to steal Syrian oil with impunity - this has to be stopped!
7253 2018-08-29 08:46:09 Exactly.. No one is questioning how this guy got those parcels before oil was officially announced..
7254 2018-08-29 08:45:47 Jeremy Corbyn thinks that NATO is the “engine for delivering oil to the oil companies”. Discuss.............

7268 2018-08-29 08:42:06 All these one share shareholders in Arsenal aren't upset they have to sell their shares. Bet they'll all be happy if it was an Arab Oil Sheikh who promises to spend money instead of Kroenke. Get over it.
7269 2018-08-29 08:41:57 In a way, this would hasten restructuring because the hands on the till will ultimately go away as NNPC moves away from inefficiencies. No one will keep a redundant employee in the corporation anymore. No one will seek and get undue favours from the corps again...

7287 2018-08-29 08:39:44 he had said Trump said that because he refused to give him oil. I believe this had shown how are resources are being shared.
7288 2018-08-29 08:39:41 Hey, @Paulkenny79 do you have a link to @RDI_at_LIT 's analysis? Non-metered fuels are indeed tricky. Might be useful to install oil meters on a nationally representative sample as part of a longitudinal study to get more insights for policy, baselining, and modelling.

7291 2018-08-29 08:39:23 Hmmmm...either way, the ultimate goal is to hand the oil industry to Nigerians, one of the offshoots of the NNPC would have its shares in the stock exchange, and an independent board. With the laws, it would be a lot easier to review if restructuring happens...

7314 2018-08-29 08:34:31 Yeah am aware of this. Personally,I still believe restructuring is the way to go,but I guess even if the entire PIB is passed n restructuring occurs,another law can be made for a state/fed sharing formula.
7315 2018-08-29 08:34:28 You can use flavourless oil like vegetable or refined oil
7316 2018-08-29 08:34:25 ... Petroleum Industry Revenue Management Bill. The first 4 had advanced faster with PIGB done with. The other 3 have gone through public hearings. The PIGB is the most critical of them all. It is the building block for a sustainably-run oil industry.

7515 2018-08-29 07:55:55 Doorlocks are a total waste of power, oil and Gas. 
7516 2018-08-29 07:55:28 I wonder how many tons of CO2 per year will be emitted as a result of the oil extracted by those platforms.
7517 2018-08-29 07:55:00 It’s based on Alaskan Permanent Fund earnings which are tied to oil company profits.  The last year I was there was the year of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  I donated mine to the @peregrinefund.

7524 2018-08-29 07:53:37 Without the internet there is no Bitcoin so I have to agree with him. Total gross market cap of the "Internet" trumps all other markets on Earth. Domain Names are the first & most valuable digital assets ever. Bitcoin is the oil that will make the digital wheels of commerce turn.

7528 2018-08-29 07:53:09 It was a simple question a reasonable question, same logic as yours;
In an Indy Scotland, will Scotland get back all the billions in revenue from oil and gas taken/stolen (not paid to) by Westminster since discovery. A possible yes, no answer is all it takes.

7529 2018-08-29 07:53:00 Oil is even the worst...Oil has more than 89 by-products and Nigeria is importing all...so I buy your 1barrel of oil at $75 and spend $1500 to get all the by-products and sell it back to you at $4000... agricultural age is gone even industrialization is allmost gone
7530 2018-08-29 07:52:23 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes.

7543 2018-08-29 07:47:53 Please ask HE Peter Obi what NOI did with the FGN's of oil windfall when the NGF insisted on having their shares?

7556 2018-08-29 07:44:51 Watching Tope Fasua on Kakaaki, actually the non oil sector preformed better than the oil sector.....I know some people will not like this but argue with Tope Fasua.
7557 2018-08-29 07:44:47 Guess the US needs to stop being big ‘democracy’ to all those oil rich countries.

Guess we should have let Nazi Germany carry on with its self determination.

It’s the job of a civilised society to stop bigotry, oppression & discrimination.

7559 2018-08-29 07:44:28 Moderates tend to try to keep things status quo. There is real pain in this country, and trump was able to feed those in pain his snake oil. The disenfranchised need progressives, people who will actually help them. try to find the progressive in you.

7595 2018-08-29 07:35:18 It was Churchill’s idea to divide and rule because he was sure Independent India would never indulge in trade with Britain, and Britain wanted trade (of oil, i guess). Thus the idea of partition, hatred and then supporting these groups to fight for partition.

7655 2018-08-29 07:22:24 All you people happy that it’s raining and cold again are some next virus. Disappointed in this UK weather. I thought we’d finally used enough plastic and burnt enough oil to make it consistently hot here...
7656 2018-08-29 07:22:16 Flours and oil are both not allowed during Navratri, mere touching of Vegetable oil can harm the rituals :) Loving meat is fyn but dont demean rituals to promote it!!!

7658 2018-08-29 07:21:58 Dick Cheney shot a man in the face on accident! Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

7666 2018-08-29 07:20:42 I will not vote for a President who puts his selfish interest above the good of the country. 
A President who turned down the PIGB just because he thinks he won't have absolute control over the oil industry.

7685 2018-08-29 07:17:58 These companies would prefer prices low. They’re not going to@be selling oil in a straight up form. They can charge more or value add like capsules. Think of it as an input cost.

7709 2018-08-29 07:12:36 Couldn’t agree more- One of the key reasons we install metering in most of @super_homesIrl is to validate performance.

7713 2018-08-29 07:12:01 There are other parallels between Trumpism and Putinism: the glorification of oil, gas and mining over science and technology; the elevation of white, Christian, nationalist values; and the neutering of the legislative branch — today’s G.O.P.-dominated Congress behaves just like

7728 2018-08-29 07:09:56 Why don't people understand that it's not the industry pioneering change that's paying for support, it's the already established industries (like oil and coal) that are the "Big" guys wanting to shut the mouths of people wanting a cleaner planet
7729 2018-08-29 07:09:52 RAKUTAN!!
7730 2018-08-29 07:09:44 Mother Nature hasn’t been burning once locked up coal oil and gas for 150 years adding greenhouse gases that trap more heat. That’d be us humans. Your lot are happy to see the GBReef die for your ideology.
7731 2018-08-29 07:09:32 You have to respect these girls with nothing that start up a small business to support themselves. Nigeria is a Shitty country.Whether it is oil perfume, PR, Blogger, MUA, skin care stuff whatever it is.. you’ve to respect them . It’s Not Easy 
7732 2018-08-29 07:09:17 There is no doubt that oil and gas are also polluting, and also contribute to climate change, which is why we campaign for a 100% renewable energy future. Coal is the biggest fossil fuel in SA though, hence the focus.

7734 2018-08-29 07:08:58 Is that his opinion or an advertisement? I always take what he says with a pinch of salt. 

And I think Rudy’s is good but they over oil their pizzas. I prefer DZ and Proove over them.
7735 2018-08-29 07:08:56 Should I tell my friends when they should take their wigs in for an oil change? Asking for a friend.
7736 2018-08-29 07:08:29 Oil, territorial backing, destabilization.
7737 2018-08-29 07:08:10 And, it should also be remembered that, a sizeable chunk of the UKs current exports to Nigeria, & elsewhere in Africa, relate to the oil & gas sector, which will be based predominantly in independent Scotland.

They want to go to war because they believe it will save lives or end oppression. Difference between having a different perspective and being evil.

7756 2018-08-29 07:04:09 I can’t say a disagree with you here. I’m sure big oil has prohibited progress for electric and hydrogen car tech. Unfortunately, this is the hand we’re dealt! So all we can do is encourage open minds to this subject and more money to R&D to alternate energy sources...

7764 2018-08-29 07:02:31 Really,Norway has the same amount of oil as Scotland and they are one of the worlds richest countries.
UK made millions from oil this year but Norway made 29Billion.If oil was as bad as you say it is then it would be devolved to make snp look bad.
7765 2018-08-29 07:01:51 Are you an entrepreneur looking to undercut competitors & corner the market in a crowded field? Here’s a tip: BEARD OIL. Make it & sell it for a few bucks. 
Currently it costs right around $15 for a 2 ounce vial. Give consumers a low price alternative and the world’s your oyster.

7798 2018-08-29 06:56:35 Thank you Mister Morrison. Every time I'm worried about our governments human rights abuses, homophobic bullshit, the damage you are causing to farmers by leaving our natural resources to be stripped away by oil companies.

7931 2018-08-29 06:30:00 The president if he truly and really did this, has simply scored an own goal in his claims of fighting against corruption because the PIGB would've done that for him in the oil industry.
7932 2018-08-29 06:29:52 They use all of the oil in the White House for the Trump Boys' hair.
7933 2018-08-29 06:29:44 Meri suzuki mein bhi Rs100/litre wala oil dalta hai. It does 8km per litre...bani gala to Secretariat is about 20km Road distance. So Rs. 250 for 20km. That's about Rs12.5/km
7934 2018-08-29 06:29:39 You seem to believe in window dressed Budget (hiding subsidies/oil bonds etc) & GDP with double digit inflation/4.9% Fiscal Deficit & high CAD in UPA era, essentially due to scams

7937 2018-08-29 06:29:31 Mi psicóloga una vez recomendó de no utilizar el celular o cualquier otro artefacto electrónico al menos una hora antes de dormir. Lavender oil is good too, you can put a drop on your pillow. Or drink melatonin (vitamin).

7939 2018-08-29 06:29:15 Now there’s some mental gymnastics. Here we are to save the day! Got any oil?
7940 2018-08-29 06:29:15 #just up sipping a lil line of oil
7941 2018-08-29 06:29:00 There are literally two countries with a diet based on using olive oil for cooking: Greece and Italy. They have probably one of the best diets in the world. Considering the amount of pasta Italians eat they should all be ill from all that fried olive oil.
7942 2018-08-29 06:29:00 And what grates my tits the most - the Police wasting time going after pensioners who grow and distribute oil for people who need it. 
We have much larger fish to fry to in this country.

7946 2018-08-29 06:28:11 Quote of the Day

"I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity an obligation; every possession, a duty."

John D. Rockefeller »

United States industrialist who made a fortune in the oil business and gave half of it away (1839-1937)
7947 2018-08-29 06:27:41 It's a great day today because I got my oil changed.
7948 2018-08-29 06:27:30 The PIGB wants to do one thing - change the governance processes in the industry, and this includes: getting NNPC to be an efficient and less political coy overseen by a competent board; set up a value-based regulatory framework/agency; and provide biz certainty amongst others
7949 2018-08-29 06:26:28 #myn  (previously NCT) participation rts:

"Agreement with CEB whereby Northcote will be entitled, at its option, to participate in up to 12.5 percent of CEB participation in any concessions or other oil and gas transactions that it secures in Indonesia for a period of 5 years

7954 2018-08-29 06:25:27 i don’t think they felt the same way in the middle east ..bc it was based on lies and greed ,destroyed the fabric of their countries for oil and  surround iran with u.s bases
7955 2018-08-29 06:25:24 No one is really looking at how Buharinomics is leaving Nigeria debt-ridden. A debt our great grand children will be saddled with if oil price remains low.
7956 2018-08-29 06:25:22 the almond milk hack is to keep stirring so the oil that makes it creamy doesn't separate out 
#cocosalmostvegan
7957 2018-08-29 06:25:18 Kyu tu oil lagata hai tere pichwade pe?
7958 2018-08-29 06:25:05 Did you hear the conditions USA gave to withdraw from Syria? One of them was that US oil companies get a share of oil exploited in Northern Syria. Any doubt US army works for oil companies at US taxpayer expense.
7959 2018-08-29 06:25:03 The article is littered with mistakes. Saudi oil volumes did not increase in 2014, so the price crash was not caused by Saudi. Oil prices are not artificially low, the period between 2011-2014 were unusually high. Venezuela only stayed alive when oil prices were at record highs
7960 2018-08-29 06:25:03 Which Extra Virgin Olive Oil you use? So many fakes out there.
7961 2018-08-29 06:24:32 They've ruled out other sources, animal fats, spent cooking oil etc as either too expensive or unscalable. So what logic mistake am I making by assuming one (blended) fuel? The sustainability criteria they set out above are also tough to meet.
7962 2018-08-29 06:24:27 Subsidy is a big subsidiary in NNPC. It has its own management team and staffs.

7966 2018-08-29 06:23:34 I cut a package of tofu into cubes, saute it in sesame oil, and keep it in a covered bowl in the fridge. It tastes great in salads, soups, roasted veggies, anything!

7970 2018-08-29 06:22:42 I knew they were going to shoot at her and her parents when they came out of the wedding. So I went to the corner store and I bought a bottle of bleach and motor oil and I put it in front of the church.

7973 2018-08-29 06:22:03 Tweez throwing oil on the fire 
7974 2018-08-29 06:22:02 The president’s alleged refusal to sign the PIGB is bad. There's no confusion here, and he can as well kiss his ERGP goodbye without the PIGB. Our oil industry needs an overhaul. Petrol subsidy removal, domestic refining, gas-based industrialisation, etc need to happen now.

8002 2018-08-29 06:17:22 Jet fuel is the cheapest fuel , caricine oil mati ka taail is expensive than jet fuel.
8003 2018-08-29 06:16:55 But European USE palm oil everyday (body lotion, shampoo, body wash, lipstick, lip balm, cookies, etc) from our forest. Unilever, P&G, etc.
8004 2018-08-29 06:16:49 Certainly, and that’s a problem with the settler-colonist system we live in. Arctic oil extraction in the arctic harms more sea life than subsistence hunting, yet there’s very little effort in ending arctic oil extraction because it benefits settler-colonists.
8005 2018-08-29 06:16:35 Jeez, what's it gonna take? Maybe if we catch a priest in the act of molesting a migrant child with a plastic straw in a gas station bathroom while on his way to celebrate mass on an oil rig in the gulf, the interests of the faithful & the clergy will finally be aligned. Nah.

8023 2018-08-29 06:14:26 Global warming could be controlled if we all became vegetarians and stopped eating meat. That's the view of British physicist Alan Calverd, who thinks that giving up pork chops, lamb cutlets and chicken burgers would do more for the environment than burning less oil and gas

8064 2018-08-29 06:05:33 So, guys. Don’t forget to oil the pan before you drop the eggs in or it’s gonna be very difficult to not make scrambled eggs instead. But honestly what’s the difference?
8065 2018-08-29 06:05:26 What is up with august. People are hurting.

Once we got her back into bed after her fall (took 5 people), I gave her a small pouch that has some lavender in it plus added some extra lavender oil to her fingers and the outside of the pouch. Tucked her in, and made sure she had her phone, lip stuff, etc. 
8068 2018-08-29 06:04:10 I underestimated the spiciness of this chili oil
8069 2018-08-29 06:03:56 #venezuela - what rubbish - this country should be one if the richest in the world given its oil reserves - its the nutty left-wing government that has caused its problems - people are leaving in droves

8073 2018-08-29 06:03:40 One day I recreated your luminol synthesis. 2-Ethylhexanol, one of the side products smells like fusel oil you know. Every time I started separating it, fruit flies appeared from nowhere and end up drown in beaker. Looks like long-chain alcohols are attractants for flies.
8074 2018-08-29 06:03:38 Literally: to sell oil

Since I was a potato, I dreamed of a thin slice covered with delicious oil and then warmed in the

8079 2018-08-29 06:02:14 Thank you Rosi. It is borage, its seeds are harvested and processed to make borage seed oil which is excellent for joints.

8086 2018-08-29 06:00:52 The story might cover up for who he really was there to meet, as well as wtf he was doing in Baku. There is oil. It’s also a convenient place to meet with Russians secretly. He is probably complicit in Trumps treason. London might have been meetings w/oligarchs. We’re all so fkd

8092 2018-08-29 05:59:49 How much are we earning now from oil, what have we done to avert similar challenges in the future?

8093 2018-08-29 05:59:37 Last time I went to one of them places they tried to charge me $80 for a basic oil change that I normally pay $30-35 for so fuck them
8094 2018-08-29 05:59:37 This project sounds like a stealth oil export terminal. Where would raw materials for biodiesel come from? Old french fry oil from St Helens? The previous failed alcohol plant was far away from raw material. The attraction then was that only Co. Commissioners needed to approve.

8096 2018-08-29 05:59:14 We are living in really wierd times. People prefer WhatsApp than picking up and calling . People prefer negative news than positive news . People talking about lab meat and the funniest things is that coconut oil is bad for your health. 
8097 2018-08-29 05:59:07 Trump has only had two one on one seat downs with Two Africa’s heads of state:
1. Nigeria 
2. Kenya

The main thing they both have in common is oil. But from the enthusiasm of the visit to White House especially by the Trump team should be something to think about.

8100 2018-08-29 05:57:44 What is it called again? It’s olive oil made just for hair or can you use it to cook too? It seems like it would make the hair look and feel super oily though. I obviously have never used stuff like that before. I’m actually looking for some anti-frizz stuff for my hair.
8101 2018-08-29 05:57:30 naw... Food cooked with weed oil or butter
8102 2018-08-29 05:57:29 Then, BECAUSE of policies in mid east there was oil shock, then hostages..the public seeing policy failures while taking on burden of high energy costs ALL because of his admin's policy of uprising in Iran that basically started it all? Comes on tv to blame public discourse? Ok
8103 2018-08-29 05:57:05 yung mga plain na foods like lugaw,sopas, skyflakes, biscuits na dimasyadong matamis or salty. tas sa ulam naman kahit ano basta naka olive oil para medyo safe daw kaso pag tumikim ako ng ganun minsanan nalang di pwedeng araw arawin

8107 2018-08-29 05:56:35 PDP just dole out one fat lie and some people couldn't think twice. Where is the report of N4tr oil money? PDP stole Nigeria money for 16 years instead of paying back installmentally they pay fake foreign audit firm to just produce anything for Nigerians to read.
8108 2018-08-29 05:56:35 And Scotland would seamlessly continue selling oil to the EU, removing the UKs biggest bargaining chip

8122 2018-08-29 05:54:18 These shipments are mostly refined products (such as diesel or gasoline) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). Crude oil doesn’t ship here due to lack of refineries. The oil they talk about is HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil), a cheap oil byproduct that runs the ships as its fuel.

8143 2018-08-29 05:50:30 What are your thoughts on almond milk for pancakes? Personally I like the texture and density better. They are light and fluffy. Then use coconut oil in pan for crispy edges and flavor. Delicious.
8144 2018-08-29 05:50:16 This is mainly due to oil price. We are not exporting any oil ..

Latest numbers I heard on that are 33,000 but you even latch a fraction of those as well, it’s a bonus.

8260 2018-08-29 05:29:04 And remember, they can only smuggle out oil (via Iraq) that has the exact same compound properties as Iraqi oils have. This would limitit to their five shared oilfields, which is in fact where most of Iran’s oil derives from. I still think ABOT is out of the question for Iran.

I think non-oil GDP fastest growth since Q4 2015 is important tho. Non-oil growth recovery, which is important to build upon.
Also, oil production dipped in Q2, reflected in oil-GDP contraction.
& oil still dominates exports & gov revenue, impacting wider economy.

they're playing capitalist middle men, but with a better cause than amazon
8288 2018-08-29 05:24:09 If they want to smuggle oil out via Iraq, the Iraqis are going to want a substantial discount because they need a significant risk margin. One thing for it to happen say 5 years ago, but the ABOT is pretty much maxed out right now as Iraq has boosted own exports.

8337 2018-08-29 05:15:22 The theory was legit in the late 1800s. As more research was done in the 1960s-70s by the oil companies themselves, they openly recognized and acknowledged the seriousness of the issue. In the 80s they deliberately chose short-term profits and denial instead of action.

8469 2018-08-29 04:52:39 Я вам открою секрет - заменители мяса по количеству белка (если вы этот критерий имеете в виду) стоят намного дешевле, чем мясо. Но проблема же не в этом, а в вашей мотивации, потому что ваша мораль - «убивать -это нормально». Как только в этой конструкции что-то измениться —>

8482 2018-08-29 04:50:54 There needs to be a car that tells when something’s wrong. Like beep bitch I need an oil change, beep bitch I need new brakes. This way you cant get pulled over for something stupid b/c you know it there and the shop cant try to tell you theres a problem w/ a random part.

THAT SHIT IS MINE!!
8497 2018-08-29 04:48:24 America has no heroes, only a bunch of cowards who murder women and children in the name of oil!
8498 2018-08-29 04:48:20 Yes. I know of one person with a Tesla and he is not an environmental person. He just thinks it is a cool expensive car. Mostly SUVs in suburban St Louis. Most people I know are not clamoring for one. World will use more oil 20 yrs from now even if US doesn’t. Mostly plastics.
8499 2018-08-29 04:48:00 He gone be mad when his durag got oil in it 
8500 2018-08-29 04:47:36 He is too slow and he isn't productive anymore. He is not what the Oil need. This franchise is  beyond frustrating
8501 2018-08-29 04:47:33 Feel free to go there too. The important part is the “no return”.  j/k  If a government takes a business, it’s amazing how the profit motive disappears and it sux. That’s why oil companies are a bit better run than the DMV and the VA. Also, I love you.
8502 2018-08-29 04:47:32 I'd pay to watch Sam Harris and Douglas Murray, but Peterson - never. I don't give my money away to snake oil salesmen.
He actually achieved fuck all on the topic he exploited to get fame/infamy (i.e. compelled speech and such), he's just in it for the money.
Bullshit artist.

8509 2018-08-29 04:46:38 Maybe he should take flaxseed oil.
8510 2018-08-29 04:46:36 The only issue I see here is - the truly big advertisers like Hindustan Lever or Colgate have products we all use at every point of our daily lives. Boycotting coke Pepsi is one thing but can we avoid toothpaste? Cooking oil? 

Also coke Pepsi etc also own food joints... +
8511 2018-08-29 04:46:23 no, but you would be among the percentage of men who are incredibly gullible and fall for any liar who sells them snake oil. Usually they are the ones who don’t know how to spell or think for themselves. Thanks for outing yourself.
8512 2018-08-29 04:46:21 Great... so it is NOT Aramco-specific.   I just want to clarify this point since other oil companies were listed in the chart.

I agree with you on the general ideas.
8513 2018-08-29 04:46:17 Does castor oil really help with your brows?

8517 2018-08-29 04:45:42 Just go & watch Samma footage where a pilot gave his opinion on Fuel Consumption of Helicopter

In 1 min Heli consumes 2 liters of Oil and those 2 liters are without any Govt. TAXES, which becomes 40 to 45 rupees per liter so 1 min cost is 80 to 90 & Bani gala is 4 mins away

8519 2018-08-29 04:45:15 In the past 10 years the world has spent $10 Trillion USD on renewable energy. The net effect is that oil and NG have retained their energy market share, and about 2% was wrestled from coal. Renewable energy (electricity) is not able to replace liquid fuels with current tech.
8520 2018-08-29 04:45:00 Omg that’s crazy we’ve only had localized ones but they stopped once they stopped oil fracking here :)

8523 2018-08-29 04:44:52 There is more natural gas than oil here but there are some rigs off the coast.
8524 2018-08-29 04:44:47 My wife has ankylosingspondylitis, bad form of arthritis, perhaps see if you don't also have that. They can do simple test to confirm. Regarding pain, they use imuno suppressant injections to stop the inflammation. Strong CBD oil also helps. Or smoking weed.

Did Putin help elect Trump to restore $500 billion Exxon oil deal killed by sanctions
Follow the money: Will Trump repay Putin by ending Russian sanctions and killing the Paris climate deal?
8532 2018-08-29 04:43:26 Ginger! I do add it in with a bit a soy sauce and sesame oil as you mentioned. I also add ginger to homemade juices. So good for you.
8533 2018-08-29 04:42:49 China building its first military outpost in oil rich gulf region in the historically inclined Communist   Afghanistan is a move to control oil wealth in the Middle East.
8534 2018-08-29 04:42:15 Investing $8 billion in Brazil's waning offshore Campos Basin could boost its oil production by 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2025, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a report.

8537 2018-08-29 04:41:18 Oil is a worldwide monopoly through OPEC. They set worldwide oil prices. Of the 15 members, Saudi Arabia has dominance. SA sometimes works with non-OPEC Russia, which has the world’s largest petroleum and gas reserves. That’s the definition of monopoly in my book.

8545 2018-08-29 04:40:12 To be fair, people made similar claims about peak oil and peak rare earths. And as supply v demand drove up prices and profit margins, new technology was invested in and the peak never happened. Maybe not applicable but I don’t see how it can be dismissed as a possibility
8546 2018-08-29 04:40:08 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
8547 2018-08-29 04:39:52 there is no disagreement here
The disagreement regarding this statement "This is why number of patents Aramco applies for is a meaningless data point"    Here is why: 
1- either you know something others do not know
2- or it is a general idea applies to all other oil companies
8548 2018-08-29 04:39:35 You have to check your tax paying amount from 2000 to now then it will be tally for your answer.Even though crude oil prize less why government not willing to reduce petrol diesel prize. you dont bother since u have more money . be lie poor then u know.
8549 2018-08-29 04:39:30 This is to grow hemp. You don’t smoke hemp.
Marijuana doesn’t cause cancer. It actually helps it and depending on what type you take it can cure cancer (RSO- Rick Simpson Oil) & many other non-curable ailments. People who otherwise were given a death sentence from Drs, lived.
8550 2018-08-29 04:39:14 #Petrol  in #Mumbai is over Rs 85 a litre. The first time I went to a pump on my own, with my father's Chetak scooter, I got 5 litres of petrol, and oil, for Rs 100. This was in 1995, I think. How much did you get in your first visit to a pump? #petrolPrice #Diesel #fuelprice

8554 2018-08-29 04:38:33 Many theories exist. Massive gas/oil find in Guyana loads of oil no refinery.

We never should have allowed foreign investors to fork up or land and waste our natural resources. Atlantic LNG, BP, Methonex, all using our resources at a rate that our exploration can't sustain.

8567 2018-08-29 04:36:29 Yup. No need. But if you are using an oil control facial wash. You might need to apply facial moisturizer 2-3 times a week.

8569 2018-08-29 04:36:17 they had organic solutions for the gulf oil spill debacle that would have safely cleaned the spill ... instead they used corexit and destroyed everything
8570 2018-08-29 04:36:17 Right now aerospace does full spectral analysis of all their materials. It’s insanely expensive. Oil and gas manage to avoid this but not for lack of a need. If you had the entire chain available for analysis you could id problems without such costly methods
8571 2018-08-29 04:36:16 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

8581 2018-08-29 04:34:29 If you have weak digestion or a cold constitution, add a little ginger. If you're cooking for multiple people, put ginger in the bowls as needed (not the pot). If you want a bit more flavor, add some sesame oil and/or some soy sauce.
8582 2018-08-29 04:34:23 No. Not about OKC hate. It’s that this state is overrun with MAGA mouth-breathing, gun toting, Bible thumping, uneducated and intolerant dullards who are attracted to snake oil charlatans like Stit.

8591 2018-08-29 04:33:37 My husband has at least ten co-workers who own farms. As in, they wake up, work on the farm, then commute to town to be able to actually make money. I had a few rich AG acquaintances in college but their families had all sold land out to oil companies...
8592 2018-08-29 04:33:28 Heavy oil sent to a heavy oil refinery produces much less waste product than light oil to a light oil refinery and the heavy oil refineries get higher margins so heavy oil is actually a very desirable product for certain customers 2/

8602 2018-08-29 04:31:58 My ass is stupid fat and the fact that it’s not being rubbed down with warm oil is just blasphemous
8603 2018-08-29 04:31:53 Well if we are going to need fossil fuels for the next 30 years then the argument being made is that it should be Canadian oil that helps pay for Canadian services. Also there are limited heavy oil suppliers out there and heavy oil is quite desirable for refineries tuned for it 1
8604 2018-08-29 04:31:41 I live in a rural area, the coyotes can absolutely look like the one in your picture.

Oil surveying with electromagnetic waves was being done near my home, and It had the wildlife spooked. Had a coyote about 5’ from my living room window. Looked like a wolf.

8608 2018-08-29 04:31:18 @htTweets @PetroleumMin @narendramodi
Ur report on 'Fuel surge' - The headlines on the front page does not mention the main cause which is increasing International oil prices. Is the paper biased against the government?

8621 2018-08-29 04:27:58 At first kay ang egg and cooking oil ra tu, okay ra ko kay food man. Sunod ana kay ako nang mga laundry and detergent soaps. Gi apil pa gyud ang fabric con! Then gi budget na baya na nako. Di man ko dalo bitaw pero mananghid ra aron ma budget nako ug tarong.
8622 2018-08-29 04:27:53 bitch I'm slicker than the oil, get it out the soil
8623 2018-08-29 04:27:46 I was once told of an oil company spending hundreds of thousands of dollars developing cooling suits for the welders so they could keep working longer in the 106 degree heat.
8624 2018-08-29 04:27:29 Soooooo did you show him where the body oil is at? 
8625 2018-08-29 04:27:25 I had the same idea but with Oil changes lmao
8626 2018-08-29 04:27:13 That makes some sense, I'm trying to understand this market. But I hope for the political will to change to prevent expansion from happening. Canada should be phasing out heavy oil production for export over the next 20 years.
8627 2018-08-29 04:26:51 i love when people who have no trouble falling asleep tell people who do to stop staying up so late as if we’re deciding to get our oil changed and run errands at 2 AM on a fucking Tuesday

8629 2018-08-29 04:26:28 But the state’s general rule is: Oklahoma City drills the oil and Tulsa sells it. And the arts, following money as they often do, end up more in T-Town.
8630 2018-08-29 04:26:27 his feelings for adam were an oil spill; he’d let them overflow and now there wasn’t a damn place in the ocean that wouldn’t catch fire if he dropped a match.
8631 2018-08-29 04:26:20 Maybe an oil for food sanction on the Venezuelan regime that gave away hundreds of billions to other corrupt dictatorships like Cuba and Bolivia when the oil $ was high and still continues to waste, steal and plunder Venezuelan resources
8632 2018-08-29 04:26:19 We should buy more oil from these guys. They are so like the people in Alberta it’s scary. You should see the abuse every day in the streets of Calgary.  Venezuela rocks!  @CanadaAction @PipelineAction @jkenney
8633 2018-08-29 04:26:19 Tea tree oil smells like my adolescence

8645 2018-08-29 04:24:09 my #MTG column in tweetdeck is often a Class A – Ordinary combustible fire. today, my lord, today it's a full blown Class F – Cooking oil fire. needs a big wet chemical extinguisher containing a formula which cools the fire and then emulsifies to prevent re-ignition.
8646 2018-08-29 04:24:05 Lol. This is the EXACT same shit Kalamashaka pulled wakabaki wakikula hiyo ulegend yao. Don't sweat it bro, watatii... Ughetto na biz ni maji na oil, hazimix.

8649 2018-08-29 04:23:50 Favorite new Bio Diesel customer of the summer ~ the Patagonia @wornwear rig! Price holding steady at around $4.75/gallon for the last 5 years or so, made from locally sourced waste vegetable oil and available to the public here at Proof Lab, 10-6 everyday  @ Proof Lab Surf Shop
8650 2018-08-29 04:23:50 Nooo. They sell lash glue remover oil. 
8651 2018-08-29 04:23:50 Seriously you will regret not doing this. Wash them & throw them on a baking sheet. Throw on a couple of cloves of garlic. Drizzle them in olive oil. Roast them @ 400 for 20 mins. Dump it all in a bowl, mush them around, & spread them on bread. Shove in the face hole.
8652 2018-08-29 04:23:49 Ask Nestle, I think they were not too happy he was going to provide free water to western Africa that has been in drought. Between that and attempting to change the fiat currency of oil.
8653 2018-08-29 04:23:12 just did a line of Young Living Lavender Essential Oil
8654 2018-08-29 04:22:33 you dig for oil , sometimes you hit a sewer pipe !
8655 2018-08-29 04:22:25 I disagree, oil took a shit and thats why Oklahoma went into the dumps.  I’m still probably going to vote for @DrewForOklahoma though.  I’m sick of these republicans. We need better education, which leads to a more diverse economy, which this state needs badly.
8656 2018-08-29 04:22:10 @lizzwizzie  The way I see it is....Deep State is big business,  oil, coal, pharma, banking that are the real controllers of the world.   The puppeteers of the so called goverments.  Our government in the US.   That is what Deep State is supposed to be.
8657 2018-08-29 04:21:51 This could happen in America once the invaders illegals refugees, get their act together. They must be stop, south africa needs help. They don't have oil, but they have gold and diamonds.
8658 2018-08-29 04:21:43 Had Modi ji’s FM understood the economy and tackled the Bank NPAs before anything else by using the cheap crude oil bonanza, the economy would be roaring by now in line with global growth the need for fudges like #UrbanNaxals etc would not arise.

8662 2018-08-29 04:20:51 Yeah! I made an essential oil spray of citronella, lemongrass & grapefruit. Lavender sounds like a great idea, it probably smells a lot better than my mixture

8664 2018-08-29 04:20:35 It's also the best thing for an ecosystem, so long as the animals live in their natural environment: pasture-raised! 

There is no *natural* high-nitrogen fertilizers without animals (who wants to douse crops with crude oil? That's already happening in industrial agriculture!)
8665 2018-08-29 04:20:32 [comms brainstorm] don't laugh, but my grappling hook is jammed and i'm stuck hanging over the oil reservoir, please help

8672 2018-08-29 04:19:05 Horrible loss tonight for @Phillies. A pitcher pinch running left early on a sacrifice fly. That's a tough way to lose a game. Damn. They've been leaking oil the last couple of weeks. SMDH!
8673 2018-08-29 04:18:55 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS--Want to think about what you can do, legally, without being stomped on for 1st Amendment rights?  Break up the monopolies of Google, Facebook and Twitter--Larger than Standard Oil.  Consider it.
8674 2018-08-29 04:18:54 Just keep off our oil field. We can pay our bills, we don't need your aid.
8675 2018-08-29 04:18:46 Well then you’re in luck that I just so happen to know the right few people who can hook you up [chuckles as I take a piece of bread off the table after dunking it into some olive oil & balsamic vinegar and popping into my mouth] That is fantastic to hear. I’m already expecting>
8676 2018-08-29 04:18:41 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
8677 2018-08-29 04:18:29 Read up. We've already covered this. It's all bullshit. Inflation, oil and gas increasing, interest rates rising, ballooning deficit, nat debt all-time high, household debt all time high, middle income wages decreasing, on and on. It's all a steaming facade.
8678 2018-08-29 04:18:15 CBD oil now legal in every state.  I’d urge everyone with CP to investigate this gift from above.  So thankful we have full blown access to THC & medical marijuana here in WA state.  Promising for all CP sufferers who aren’t scared of the silly stigma.

8700 2018-08-29 04:14:51 Almost time for a pumpkin spice oil change
8701 2018-08-29 04:14:47 What you are really saying is that water is there to be polluted and forests are there to be deforested.  National parks are there to be downsized so that oil companies can move in.@DevinNunes
8702 2018-08-29 04:14:13 No, it was Richard Nixon, in response to the OPEC oil embargo. I’m sure Carter liked it, but it started in ‘73.

8708 2018-08-29 04:13:19 Too bad the price of oil is falling.  They are NOTHING when it’s under $70/barrel, and not a worry unless over $100/barrel.
8709 2018-08-29 04:13:16 ごま油、タンスの角に指ぶつけろ。

8715 2018-08-29 04:12:45 That person mentioned painted there face, black face was done with shoe polish back then. Which was earier to get off your skin than oil based pain.  Which you need paint thiner to remove, and paint thiner on face is a no-go.
8716 2018-08-29 04:12:32 I kinda just winged it. Melt butter lemon juice & minced garlic then whisk it together & pour onto salmon which is in foil pocket, bake at 400 for 13 mins.

For pasta just heat olive oil & add clove of garlic sliced then when pasta is al dente add that + Parmesan & parsley. Serve
8717 2018-08-29 04:12:31 I tried to work on my homework, but I couldn't find my bottle of oil.
8718 2018-08-29 04:12:27 my acne works hard but tea tree oil works harder
8719 2018-08-29 04:12:12 If your state so wealthy can you tell your state to stop forcing us to subsidize your state. NY doesn’t subsidize TX we do for you. By the way TX we have that oil money billionaires and millionaires. Their just smart enough to live somewhere where there isn’t state taxes.
8720 2018-08-29 04:12:02 Yet another morning to wake to where @realDonaldTrump says's he's either the best ever in "history" or "No collusion and/or Witch Hunt"!

8723 2018-08-29 04:11:24 Some businesses succeed, some businesses fail. That was true before the minimum wage wage increased, and it’s true afterwards. Coincidence doesn’t imply causation. Maybe their failure can be attributed to the drop in the price of oil. Or maybe they just weren’t great restaurants.
8724 2018-08-29 04:11:20 Well that's good. Try starting it and see if the codes clear. Oil pressure and check engine light.

8730 2018-08-29 04:10:12 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
8731 2018-08-29 04:10:09 Specifically, I'd try broad- (or full- if you're allowed) spectrum CBD oil sublingually and vaporizing CBD with indica-derived terpenes either with a pen or a dabber, as well as Valerian root, a remedy that doesn't deserve capital case, if you ask me.
8732 2018-08-29 04:10:06 I am all about tea tree and jojoba oil!
8733 2018-08-29 04:09:34 Hey now, give broccolini a chance. Start small, work your way up. The only way I eat it now is roasted, with olive oil and a light dusting of seasoning. 
8734 2018-08-29 04:09:32 I have filled socks with kitty litter and essential oil and shoved them in my shoes in hopes they'll unstink enough until I can get new ones. 
And now, I sit and watch NHL Countdown and listen to New Years Day.

8736 2018-08-29 04:09:15 I bought micellar water cleanser tapi balik balik mesti guna oil cleanser juga sebab senang and cepat, no cotton pad needed. I love using oil cleanser.
8737 2018-08-29 04:08:57 More like on a Shaku's level!
8738 2018-08-29 04:08:52 Is it i can no longer burn midnight oil anymore lmao i just woke up feeling like my entire body is gonna fall apart. 
8739 2018-08-29 04:08:46 Enhance flow of oil to American oil co/s in Europe.
8740 2018-08-29 04:08:36 Boleh je. Tapi i trust more dkat oil cleanser even dah lap pakai miceller water. Sebab oil ni mcm deep cleans utk bersihkan pores. So takde lah pori tersumbat and hasilkan jerawat, whitehead, blackhead etc.
8741 2018-08-29 04:08:33 likewise. :-) dont place blame. focus on actions that cause mitigation of CC. Big Oil wants to argue blame forever. defeat by ignoring that.

8754 2018-08-29 04:05:44 I HATE this 4 cylinder turbo crap.  It is done to increase power to simulate a 6 cylinder but keep gas mileage descent but it puts more stress on the engine, requiring it to use synthetic oil.  I'd NEVER own one of these past 80,000 miles and NEVER a used one.

8898 2018-08-29 03:45:53 isn’t it funny how boomers/conservatives are so down with “sacrificing for the greater good” when it comes to fighting meaningless wars over money & oil, but when it comes to supporting social programs that *actually* contribute to the greater good, you’re a “Damn Commie!!” lol
8899 2018-08-29 03:45:35 A short 10 years from now, the BC & federal Greens will lead our nation & Province. As transportation changes to Electric, the Greens decide to cut oil export through the pipeline by 65%. Then you’ll say “good thing the Greens bought the pipeline in 2018”. Won’t you? Take credit?

8914 2018-08-29 03:43:29 I have very combination skin, some days I'm very oily and some days I'm dry and some days I'm both. Regardless I use a hyrdating primer. Would I still need to use oil besides? I worry about too much oil because foundations love to separate on my skin.

8917 2018-08-29 03:43:15 They have been fracking around here for yrs.. I am surprised we haven't had any earthquakes. The oil companies are using up our ground water to frack. That worries me more than anything. The water table has been dropping as it is because of drought and extra people, now fracking

8920 2018-08-29 03:42:44 Bullshit. I eat ton of ghee and don't have anything close to diabetes.

Ghee can actually help you stay lean+muscular (insulin sensitive) if used well. It is very easily digestible and stable.

The problem is vegetable oil, which oxidizes very easily. Ghee is better than that.

8950 2018-08-29 03:39:25 They have a very successful and famous one in Norway too, albeit invested in all kinds of dodgy places. At least they had the sense to take their oil boom revenues and put it to a use that would be for the benefit of all and earn income, unlike the UK where we pissed it all away.

8983 2018-08-29 03:35:18 I'm not saying start a war with Russia or punish them. When the evidence comes in IMPEACH TRUMP for trading oil sanctions & Magnitsky Act relief for the information Russia stole on his opponent, the world's largest quid-pro-quo bribe ever. Glenn can't see that? NO WAY HE'S LYING.
8984 2018-08-29 03:35:15 What affected the economy the most during the Carter Administration was a little thing called the OPEC oil embargo. That caused gas prices, interest rates and unemployment to climb. That wasn't a Carter policy . . .

8994 2018-08-29 03:34:23 I live within 1 km of solar panels, an oil pump, and a wind turbine. The only one always running is the oil pump. If we get even more hot air out of BC Environmentalists maybe we can have wind power all day!
8995 2018-08-29 03:34:23 Have you checked your oil lately.
There were 10 Bridesmaids.  5 were wise and kept their lamps full of oil.
5 were foolish and ran out having to go and buy more.
The Groom came and the 5 wise Bridesmaids followed the Groom.
The foolish ones missed His coming.
Check your oil.

9015 2018-08-29 03:31:22 I read that applying olive oil to your lashes before bed can help them grow but now it’s in my eyes and i know how people feel when they don’t have their glasses.
9016 2018-08-29 03:31:21 I don’t understand how there are people out there that don’t perform routine maintenance on their car- let their oil changes go over by thousands of miles. Grind their brakes until they are nothing. Let their inspections go. And still manage to have better luck than me with cars.
9017 2018-08-29 03:31:14 We need to get on that castor oil wave
9018 2018-08-29 03:31:12 I use all natural products on my hair. Literally things you can find in your kitchen like eggs, bananas, avocados, honey, olive oil, and coconut oil. #naturalhairgrowth

9022 2018-08-29 03:30:56 So, there’s an essential oil called Valerian that helps relieve anxiety, heart palpitations, and lots more! The only downside to it is that it FREAKING REEKS LIKE FEET.
9023 2018-08-29 03:30:51 Its snake oil! And it seems like he's just a puppet and someone else is pulling the strings to pass this evil agenda.

9035 2018-08-29 03:29:27 My one observation for today is that despite a series of bullish headlines, oil didn't rally. Also, it shouldn't be a huge shock retail has done well given that the gasoline spike fretted about in May never materialized this summer.
9036 2018-08-29 03:29:09 Kapler doesn’t stress, coconut  oil takes care of that

Tomato juice & lemon bath, Dawn ultra (gets the oil off), and Tresemme after all that is safe & will help rehydrate your skin.
9152 2018-08-29 03:11:32 Trump is on a tweet storm.... hopefully he sends a tweet rocket to help this oil trade

9156 2018-08-29 03:11:07 BS. Smoke and mirrors. Lies. Hot air. Showmanship. Divider. Snake oil salesman. Trump.
9157 2018-08-29 03:10:38 That's why they said August 12-13. My belief. The girl's were already dead. She came in, smell, checks on girl's. Realized something is wrong & he then strangled her. She would've died knowing he killed their children. That's why he put them in oil tanks for 4 days. #ChrisWatts
9158 2018-08-29 03:10:34 .@HunstmanAbby I admired u greatly on @ffweekend! When I read u were leaving to join @TheView I was stunned! Couldn’t imagine why u would make such a decision. I wish u well but I would rather jump in a vat of boiling oil than watch that awful show. Guessing I’m not the only one.
9159 2018-08-29 03:10:34 In shost gusto nilang kumita ayaw naman gumastos
9160 2018-08-29 03:10:17 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

9164 2018-08-29 03:10:12 I despise the smell of tea tree oil, but it makes waxing bearable.
9165 2018-08-29 03:10:11 Ayaw lang po mag invest sa E-jeepney kase daw po mahal
9166 2018-08-29 03:09:53 Idk what to tell you sweety no but really you should use castor oil mixed with coconut oil and vitamin e oil and put it on your hair line and eyebrows every night then wash it off in the morning  
9167 2018-08-29 03:09:19 does tea tree oil work
9168 2018-08-29 03:09:08 Iniisip ko ngayon:

Kapag binatikos si duterte may taga davao city na nagtatanggol

Kapag si Leni ang binatikos, asaan yung taga naga?
9169 2018-08-29 03:09:07 No they dont vote 98%

Bernie is anti all of that

9174 2018-08-29 03:08:19 Dosev hates the oil biz. He is my enemy. Lived in destin for 16 years, but I remain an Oklahoman in my heart. Hate oil and gas, he is the enemy.
9175 2018-08-29 03:07:58 The 'Machine' has reached full bore. Defense Attorneys are burning the night oil!

9177 2018-08-29 03:07:36 There is a lot of oil to burn, at least 200years at current consumption.
9178 2018-08-29 03:07:19 I like the Dr. Miracle's Deep Conditioner with Jojoba Oil & Vitamin A & E. It's the "strong " one. They come in small packs and I think it's like $2
9179 2018-08-29 03:07:07 Here are the Pre-Kinder as they learn about the layers of the ocean. They made their very own ocean bottles using water, corn syrup, oil, dish soap, and alcohol. 
9180 2018-08-29 03:06:55 Not likely, the investment has been made on these projects they will be worked and their outputs exported by rail if necessary. Investment decisions were made with the understanding of transportation bottlenecks. But oil-by-rail is less safe and produces more GHGs than pipeline
9181 2018-08-29 03:06:51 Clearly this is not true.  If they even attempted such a ridiculous stunt they wouldn't have a Navy anymore.  They can burn our flag, but wouldn't disrupt oil supply and makes us pay more at pump. If history tell us anything, this is a big NO No
9182 2018-08-29 03:06:45 Do the oil change light come on in every car you get in???
9183 2018-08-29 03:06:22 New favorite thing: turning all the lights off, burning candles, diffusing oil, and dancing to blues music in the midst of thunderstorms. 

Self care at it's purest form. 
9184 2018-08-29 03:06:16 Forgot to put on eucalyptus oil before our walk... damn mosquitos had themselves a feast! Can we pleeease take these jerks out?! I hate them 
9185 2018-08-29 03:05:46 It'll interest you that in just 3yrs of Buhari, at $48 billion,our foreign reserve is now bigger than South Africa's &oil even sold at $38 per barrel,at a point,from $120 per barrel that GEJ had.
So don't just be shouting about #22 trillion now when #360 trillion gave us nothing!
9186 2018-08-29 03:05:44 Been sleeping with lavender oil drops on my pillow the past 2 nights. Shit has me k.o
9187 2018-08-29 03:05:44 [Nods] I’ve seen that quote before. In my view, it’s all a heady cocktail of snake oil and Kool-Aid.

9198 2018-08-29 03:03:34 If anyone eating coconut oil did not know that it’s saturated fat, and that saturated fat has been long linked to heart disease by some organisations, then maybe they should check out what they’re eating first

9202 2018-08-29 03:03:13 Maybe some castor oil will clear things up? Been watching “The Little Rascals” and boy did those kids hate castor oil, Limburger cheese and the adult world.
9203 2018-08-29 03:02:55 Sports are dumb. Life is suffering. I am in possession of some snake oil the @Phillies are referring to as a “Fall Pass.”
9204 2018-08-29 03:02:47 Neoliberalism is strong with this one. Don't worry Jeff bezos, your "donations" will still buy our votes. By the way how's the "news"  and not at all propaganda thing going? Oh could you hold a sec, I've got big oil on the other line.

9208 2018-08-29 03:02:00 It might have something to do with CBD oil of which I know NOTHING
9209 2018-08-29 03:02:00 Two things from today:

9231 2018-08-29 02:58:12 Yes! We recommend to properly dilute with carrier oil according to the dilution rate recommended for this oil, which is listed on the website as well as on the label of each bottle!
9232 2018-08-29 02:58:10 Just wondering right bow in South Carolina unleaded gas is $.2.41 a gallon. Some of us have to choose gas over buying food to go to work each day.

You won't discuss capping it or lowering our need for oil or not drilling to begin with?

9242 2018-08-29 02:56:15 $TLRY $CGC produce CBD oil, a fantastic tonic. I can assure you if CBD was developed and patented by a pharma firm, it would be a blockbuster drug.

9264 2018-08-29 02:52:34 Understanding personal triggers is essential.  Problems arise where they are ubiquitous food - like canola oil (known as rapeseed oil in UK) which are considered healthy, sustainable and used everywhere from tinned food, via cookies to almost all frying in restaurants

9278 2018-08-29 02:50:54 @NGDPAdvisers is correct. It was purely the fall and rise of oil prices that led BLS’s real earnings series’ growth rate (which does NOT measure real wages) to rise from 2014 to 2015 and to fall since 2016. So much for Jared Bernstein’s “hostile institutions” theory.

But as soon as we get down to serious issues@fawadchaudhry asks us to Google oil prices for Helis,CM Punjab pix in helis, Khawar Maneka in trouble etc etc.Give us a break please.

9289 2018-08-29 02:49:08 Putin’s russia seems like the parasite that overtook the host. An illicit economy exists in the margins created by the prohibitions of a legitimate economy. His kleptocracy and boundless greed is a threat to the species. We’re doing less on climate while the price of oil is up.
9290 2018-08-29 02:48:52 my scalp is oily, i realized and i wish my hair would let the oil go down the whole strands
9291 2018-08-29 02:48:35 Quick veg pho: toss tofu cubes in cornstarch & crisp lightly in pot w a little oil. Remove. Add broth, boil, cook rice noodles. Drop in veg at hand: scallions/gr onion, carrots, shoots. Top w sesame oil, add tofu. #cheater #good

9294 2018-08-29 02:48:14 Remember, Dubba. Whenever you buy a house, whatever's in the ground belongs to you - whether it's gold or oil... or Claude Musselman.
9295 2018-08-29 02:48:05 "Ending Nevada's energy independence by banning fracking." @RobersonForNV has no idea what he's talking about. Nevada's paltry oil and gas industry contributes zero to our "energy independence" - its low grade output is primarily used for asphalt and a small amount of diesel.
9296 2018-08-29 02:47:47 Just use some coconut oil
9297 2018-08-29 02:47:34 It’s trés quaint that you still use a chandelier that’s attached to the ceiling! Mine is suspended in a refined gel distilled from peahen liver oil and it didn’t so much as ripple a shadow across my Renoir.
9298 2018-08-29 02:47:29 A teaspoon of olive oil or a raw egg over topped on his bowl should help a lot
9299 2018-08-29 02:47:25 Well I would have a hard time supporting a politician from Quebec when they refused Western oil! Even more so when I learned they take income from hydro out of their provincial figures to qualify for money from the provinces they will not support!

9302 2018-08-29 02:46:39 And what about oil rigs off the Florida coast? If DeSantis wins, they will be there.
9303 2018-08-29 02:46:33 Orioles signed Alex Cobb, Andrew Cashner, and Colby Rasmus in an attempt to make the playoffs, but it literally threw water on an oil fire
9304 2018-08-29 02:46:31 Really??? Restaurant sales in Alberta are up slightly coming out of an oil recession?
9305 2018-08-29 02:46:29 Having read the Vatican's lame response, I think we need more: We have to catch a priest in the act of molesting a migrant child with a plastic straw in a gas station bathroom while on his way to celebrate mass on an oil rig in the gulf; only then will the Pope swing into action.

9325 2018-08-29 02:43:12 Oh, amen, brother. And too often, it is used to dress up what is otherwise subpar. And don't get me started on truffle oil.

9327 2018-08-29 02:43:08 Hope they can figure out how to keep the wind blowing and the sun shining 24x7, 365 days per year or develop the worlds biggest battery. Sure renewables have their role, but setting dates to say "no oil, coal or natural gas" generation is ignoring science.
9328 2018-08-29 02:42:21 Has nothing to do with race. Same thing happened in Mao’s China. When the ignorant masses took over the privately owned fields, they had no idea how to farm them.. one reason for their country-wide starvation.  Same thing in Venezuela when ignorant took over oil co’s.

9334 2018-08-29 02:41:31 But maybe that’s also from the CBD oil 
9335 2018-08-29 02:41:07 Maybe Saudi Arabia  and the United States  do not want  oil to reach International markets.

I did read today that you are a reminder of the snake oil salesmen of the past. I've heard a lot of people say that. Many many people, more than I can count. An historic number of people. The majority of the people.

9346 2018-08-29 02:39:57 There are also presumed oil fields northeast of The Philippines.  Surveyed but not explored properly yet.  Still, oil is going to matter less in the future.

9356 2018-08-29 02:38:18 Yep, that's the real worry. Pablo is the real key to us I feel - he has been sublime so far and is the oil than keeps the machine rolling smoothly and effectively.

Noong nakaraang taon, ang tinalakay namin dito ay petrochemicals o mga kemikal na galing sa food oil. Ang mga kasali sa event na ito ay mga estudyanteng may kursong Chemical Engineering.
9424 2018-08-29 02:28:22 MSDS usually over exaggerate to er on the side of caution. For example, I have lab grade caprylic acid (a fat that's in butter and coconut oil etc.) that says it's poisonous.
9425 2018-08-29 02:28:03 You fail to mention that the Senate wants Hemp legal and if the Farm bill passes all of CVSI worries of the DEA go away!  CBD is from Hemp that will be grown in the USA very soon! Or their the #1 CBD Oil supplement and knocking it out of the park in sales. Paint the whole picture
9426 2018-08-29 02:27:55 Not only oil, they nationalized all the iron ore mining and steel smelting industry (failed), all the aluminum mining and smelting industry (failed), all the largest agriculture servicing industry (failed), they have some nationalized car manufacturing corporations (failed), etc.
9427 2018-08-29 02:27:48 Maybe they should put their money where their mouth is and refuse any equalization dollars generated by oil and gas.

9439 2018-08-29 02:25:48 The fact you name call proves you know nothing! BTW, I retired from an oil company after 33 years where I received a raise every year. I also have awesome insurance! Take a seat & zip your lying lips!

9445 2018-08-29 02:25:02 That’s the current year, whatever your name is. If we start in 2014, all you prove is that the collapse in global oil prices led a lot of job losses in the oil and gas sector. Duh. The point I made is that the private sector is recovering...which it is.
9446 2018-08-29 02:24:37 Thanks, super interesting time in the oil markets right now so that helps!

9452 2018-08-29 02:23:42 Call it a shifting regional order or a rearrangement, the fact stays that(barring Egypt), states with sizeable Shia populations are in a disarray today.(Yemen, Syria,Iran,Iraq). Clearly, control on oil and Western sympathy has a lot to do with Sunni one-upmanship.
9453 2018-08-29 02:23:40 @Alamo hi , I ve picked up a car at MiA airport on Monday 27 .. not even two days ago .. there’s a message on the screen “maintenance oil & filter” right now .  My contract is for 1 week more . Can I go back to the airport to switch the car?
9454 2018-08-29 02:23:37 Yea but it came back. It closed at $59.90. Marijuana isn’t going any where. I feel you though. I’ve been doing that with some oil companies.
9455 2018-08-29 02:23:35 I don’t have oil or gas in my car  I have to get it together man 
9456 2018-08-29 02:23:32 Hey madman, there is no subsidy and govt. is not burdened with oil bonds. It reduces Inflation to a great extent and saved money can be used in infra and other social projects. This is VIKAS. Little bit o research would have helped. But piddies can't do it.
9457 2018-08-29 02:23:09 My grandad stays asking me how much oil I have left in my car

9460 2018-08-29 02:22:51 It’s all about oil.  Prices going up in December $80 a barrel

9462 2018-08-29 02:22:37 Back in the 70’s/80’s here in Anchorage, during the oil boom! Local baker would kidnap prostitutes, keep them in his trophy room (he was a world class hunter), and then fly them out to remote areas in his plane and let them go to kill them!

9473 2018-08-29 02:21:42 And I the only one who remembers when Richard Gere and Edward Norton made Primal Fear. I guess that was when Hollywood and the media enjoyed bashing on Catholics. Then again, global warming wasn’t an issue then
9474 2018-08-29 02:21:13 I usually change mine around 7500 or at ~30% oil life. I supposedly can go 10K on full synthetic, but I just can't do it.

9480 2018-08-29 02:20:20 You are not paying for the cost of a barrel of oil today, you are paying for the cost when they bought.
9481 2018-08-29 02:20:18 This is the most ideological and political Pope we have had in decades, if not centuries, and the press wants to make it sound like it is the conservatives who have a problem
9482 2018-08-29 02:20:04 If the MSM screws this up... I'm gonna be so ! Rick Scott for Florida noooooo! Enough of him and his snake oil rhetoric. Just no!
9483 2018-08-29 02:19:50 The gospel according to Republicans?
They don't read the canonical Gospels, or they would not display the conflagration of American politics with Jesus' words & teachings. Those two things mix about as well as water & oil.

9487 2018-08-29 02:19:27 I used to be so against medicalization of cannabis. Legalize it, fine, but don’t dress it up as medicine. 

That said, I’ve been try CBD oil from hemp for my post-concussive syndrome, and it seems to be helping the headaches. I’m only using it at night, made me groggy in the day.
9488 2018-08-29 02:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
9489 2018-08-29 02:19:19 The falls reverse.  Why can't you reverse your views on jobs and Energy East.  People want oil.  Why not employ Canadians to refine it instead of paying Saudi Arabia?  Get some balls and defy Canadian Saudi oil interests. Get Energy East.
9490 2018-08-29 02:19:15 Yeah I dropped 23 prescriptions by oral injestion of 1.5-2.5 grams of decarbed oil daily - it’s so much changed my life positively

9553 2018-08-29 02:10:37 Exactly, soap cleans because of its ability to bind with both oil and water and if there's too much water in your soap it simply can't grab onto the oil and grime you're trying to clean out! It's science

9564 2018-08-29 02:09:01 Aku sempet brenti ke dokter 2 bulan. Trus pake bio oil alhamdulillah cocok, ga ada jerawat. Kalaupun ada 2/3 hari ilang. Kalau buat bekas2nya rada lama tapi worth it kok. Bisa ngeratain warna kulit. Cuman harus sabaaaaaaaaar karna ga instan
9565 2018-08-29 02:08:56 I think I have a ear infection so I dropped some warm coconut oil in my ear .  Spanish remedies .
9566 2018-08-29 02:08:52 “What essential oil should I use before I deep throat? “
9567 2018-08-29 02:08:39 The Indian people are a strange crowd. Few days back a Harvard Professor said coconut oil is pure poison. We don’t want to believe that either just because a whole bunch of us consume food cooked in coconut oil.
9568 2018-08-29 02:08:36 But seems judiciary burning extra midnight oil to hear bail plea. Strange How judiciary aaapko swift when some terrorist is caught and relief is saught?2.30pm arrest,4.00 pm matter in HC and 4.30 pm it's on?But for Karnataka when BJP approach for urgent hearing, it was declined?
9569 2018-08-29 02:08:32 Eco gel cancelled fr, well the olive oil one.
9570 2018-08-29 02:08:27 Thanks, man. I'm possibly heading out to the oil rigs in Texas.

9572 2018-08-29 02:08:00 If you make your cakes and brownies with oil, I can’t trust you.
9573 2018-08-29 02:07:42 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
9574 2018-08-29 02:07:05 I had to chill on them oil pens I’m only smoking them hoes on special occasions or if I’m going dt or a show. Plus i loveeeeee the smell of weed burning. 
9575 2018-08-29 02:07:00 日照率高低の地域差と、更に日焼けサロン通う人を絡めた紫外線日焼けの度合い、を例に出すと分かりやすかったかもですね…

9576 2018-08-29 02:07:00 What a punk. We love you, amablackpatriot! Some of these guys I just ridicule them. Start replying with stuff like "*BEEP* I'm not a Bot! Your message does not compute! *BING!* Sorry, I need some oil - I mean Borsct - I mean FOOD! *BEEP*"
9577 2018-08-29 02:06:56 Btw - your Sonia Gandhi had unpaid Iran oil bills of 43,000 crores, budget deficit of 4.4 pct of GDP.  Iran dues paid off and budget deficit reduced to 3.5 pct of gdp. Yeh bhi toh bolo Congi bhai
9578 2018-08-29 02:06:54 Get your CORN   on then.
9579 2018-08-29 02:06:51 คือจะป่วยกันทั้งออฟฟิศไม่ได้นะเว้ย 55555
9580 2018-08-29 02:06:47 Yes I do. The big thicket beard oil and balm is great. Woodsy scent but not too strong.
9581 2018-08-29 02:06:38 えっなにそれこわい…
9582 2018-08-29 02:06:29 Honestly going to bed with my boobs lathered in vitamin E oil is not on my list of favorite things to do
9583 2018-08-29 02:06:16 Sounds very exciting ,congratulations Murphy oil
9584 2018-08-29 02:06:02 Ditto never missed an oil change or a maintenance appt. Same thing with my Rav4 and my husbands Tundra (both newish).
9585 2018-08-29 02:05:57 Someone suggested making a chocolate peanut butter scent for my candles. After searching, I found the right peanut butter oil and I am doing exactly that tonight. It's kind of amazing. Kitchen's full of chocolatey peanut butter yumminess. Didnt think it would work this well.
9586 2018-08-29 02:05:49 Shit I’m on the verge. These niggas fucking up the oil pattern and shit
9587 2018-08-29 02:05:45 Coconut oil!

9591 2018-08-29 02:04:24 where would i be without coconut oil?
9592 2018-08-29 02:04:23 I-google mo ang sagot dyan and when it will stabilize. World oil price and USD strenght are primary factors of price increases. Magisip isip ka muna animal ng lipunan.
9593 2018-08-29 02:04:22 1 good but i think you have enough night time things to use once in a while
2 if the spf isnt 30+ return it 
3 tea tree oil is a good thing to just have, put it on as a spot treatment when you feel pimples growing or mix w a mask but its way too harsh to be just put on your face
9594 2018-08-29 02:04:16 *chugs coconut oil & Cyanide smoothie*
9595 2018-08-29 02:04:11 A student's mom gave me a "silent night" oil blend room spray for my classroom last Christmas. 

So far, no one is ever silent, but it smells nice!
9596 2018-08-29 02:04:05 Get some beard oil
9597 2018-08-29 02:03:54 Coconut oil might just be the best thing ever
9598 2018-08-29 02:03:43 I’m telling you like dam she need a hot oil treatment, some Shea butter and prayer to bring that hair back to life
9599 2018-08-29 02:03:34 The pipeline is linked to the completion of the Alberta's Climate Leadership Plan. It is not a factor in increasing oil sands development since the volume it will transport is already locked in via investment.
9600 2018-08-29 02:03:21 Good God I could buy an oil change kit for a V8 BMW for $90, and thought THAT was bad...
9601 2018-08-29 02:03:07 I'M NOT GONNA LIKE. POUR OIL ALL OVER IT DW ABT IT
9602 2018-08-29 02:02:09 Who is following them? I stopped watching CNN and all MainStream Media 4 years ago. When I fianly realized that Obama is just like any other politician. Not much different than Bush or Clinton. They are all pupets. Snake oil salesmans. Trump is too stupid even to be a good pupet.
9603 2018-08-29 02:02:03 Lol. It’s like someone dumped a gallon of oil on them!

Then the mechanic comes in to tell them their car needs $1600 in repairs.

You could hear many snickers.

9622 2018-08-29 02:00:04 Also it would be REALLY ignorant to deny 
European colonial history in regards to genocide & rape.

9623 2018-08-29 02:00:01 Last year, New Mexico became the 3rd largest oil producer in the United States.  Growth isn’t slowing down and 2018 is expected to be another record-breaking year!

9628 2018-08-29 01:58:13 Trudeau`s sacrificing Beautiful British Columbia 4 pipeline pipe dreams. Hes risking livelyhoods of all residents, especially whales 4 negligible profits from dirtiest oil shipped to China.B.Ctakes all risk+redneck right wing Alberta gets most of the dividends.B.C. isn`t for sale
9629 2018-08-29 01:58:12 Nineteen months into his presidency, Trump has yet to visit any war zones where American troops are fighting. HE IS A CON MAN AND YOU’RE DRINKING HIS SNAKE OIL!!! Every bankruptcy of his and scandal for 35 years - WAKE THE FUCK UP!
9630 2018-08-29 01:58:11 Well then I should go clean and oil my weapons in preparation for Trump's Jihadists. 

Because they're so gonna lose their ass come midterms. 

If the GOP retains either house at this point I'd call it a miracle.
9631 2018-08-29 01:58:09 Waste of a belt. Pan of boiling oil and tripping is better...
9632 2018-08-29 01:57:50 Unfortunately our owner never changes the oil or upgrades the parts so we are driving a falling apart car whilst our neighbours are at the dealerships buying every new model in sight 
9633 2018-08-29 01:57:50 The expensive rich white boy oil.
9634 2018-08-29 01:57:48 Brisket, crushed tomatoes, olive oil, basic seasoning. Last hour I throw in peppers and onions. Sometimes I add sofrito in as well. If I use a flank steak..
9635 2018-08-29 01:57:46 I am pro Buhari & Kemi Adeosun. But prior to the fall in oil price, Nigeria economy was number 1 in Africa. It is safe to say that anytime oil is above $60 / barrel, Nig economy will be number one in Africa. Unemployment rate & economic diversification is another thing entirely.
9636 2018-08-29 01:57:16 That would mean I’d have to get an oil change.
9637 2018-08-29 01:57:12 Someone stole my package off my porch, i hope y’all have fun with the coconut oil with y’all bum asses 
9638 2018-08-29 01:57:10 I almost had a “Kim and Kaley run in here come get yall juice” moment bc someone spilt oil on the floor and didnt even clean it
9639 2018-08-29 01:57:04 My girly 2006 truck just turned over 100,000 with not a scratch on it, I also change oil when advised like dad said

9642 2018-08-29 01:56:45 Maybe it’s because he didn’t believe in snake oil salesmen like you. You should be ashamed of yourself.
9643 2018-08-29 01:56:41 Standing for 4 hours straight doing makeup is not easy my poor legs are killing me , I feel like I need a rub down with Canadian healing oil 
9644 2018-08-29 01:56:36 We got solar panels soon after it was announced that SONGS would close bc I KNEW they would foist the cost on us (plus global warming). We got an EV soon after that (bc evil oil cartels)
9645 2018-08-29 01:56:31 Crisco works or any vegetable oil. My grocery store usually stocks a handful. They are easy to grow but I don't have a green thumb. I would mostly get them from friends gardens when I lived in NY. Good luck.
9646 2018-08-29 01:56:23 Peace out chick-fil-a... which makes me violently sick now... they changed something on their breading or oil or sauce that just screws me up now (as of about 2 years ago)
9647 2018-08-29 01:56:08 All I know was we were talkin’ ‘bout #bewbs and then I go shoot a pistol match, come back and we are changing oil.
9648 2018-08-29 01:56:05 We lost 5-6 gold against those importer African athletes. Oil rich countries buy African athletes to win medals because their native people can't win the medal.
9649 2018-08-29 01:56:00 Not 7 PM yet maybe ???
9650 2018-08-29 01:55:53 Hearing someone else pronounce the word oil the way I do is such a cathartic experience.
9651 2018-08-29 01:55:50 Foolish. His dismantling of the EPA is gonna ruin every one's future except oil and coal executives. Tax cuts for the rich, trade war hurting the working class his empowering of hate groups.. This lady has been brainwashed.
9652 2018-08-29 01:55:45 itu cleansing oil nya..boleh minta review ga? wkwkwk
9653 2018-08-29 01:55:24 If my scalp is angry (itchy, burning) I use tea tree oil then I go over it with water bc it’s super strong by itself. Other times I use castor oil for ‘growth and thickness’ olive oil is great too.
9654 2018-08-29 01:55:05 If i use Tame the Pain, do i need to mix it with carrier oil?

IT DOESN'T ILLEGALS COST $!
9657 2018-08-29 01:54:46 Hold the olive oil.
9658 2018-08-29 01:54:43 “Bull Stitt,” eh? I was in good ol’ Oklahoma for about 24 hours (hello from a TUL-HOU bird by the way—lots of oil dbags with me!). Congrats: you guys have The Worst political ads I’ve seen all across This Land. The AG One invoking Mollie Tibbets was despicable.

Oil & vinegar (not vinagrette!)
Provolone
Double salami
Pepperoni
Lettuce
6 tomatoes (they will try to give you less unless you specify)
Olives
Pepperoncini

It's...passable.

9680 2018-08-29 01:51:33 Venezuela is selling oil directly to US refineries. They have less to sell because production has been rapidly declining (no new investment), and mortgaged a bunch of it to pay Russia and China for gibs to pay for populist giveaway programs.

My fav roasting oil is avocado or macadamia nut.  Except asparagus = grapeseed.  Not picky or anything.

9692 2018-08-29 01:50:12 Hurling insults isn't helpful. Renewables here will take time to offset fossil fuels. Why is gov't expanding oil transport instead of directing $ to renewables? Want solar on roof & go from hybrid to electric soon, but few incentives to do so. Enviro suffers & incr. health costs.

9695 2018-08-29 01:49:41 Each must formulate a feasible energy cocktail (policy, market & generation tech) that brings emissions WAY down. That means cutting coal, gas & oil. If emissions aren’t falling, the mix must be adjusted. Clean tech, valuing externalities, etc. are all allied in that fight.
9696 2018-08-29 01:49:40 _So they say Petrotrin wasn’t producing enough oil to operate the point-a-pierre refinery  so is like they pushing out 40.000 barrels per day when they were suppose to push out 140.000 barrels  _

9698 2018-08-29 01:49:28 ...and blaming the public for 'Climate Change' even tho extracting 1 trillion cubic feet of oil from the Earth and replacing it with water is probs the cause of the oceans heating. I mean what happens if you replace your cars oil with water, jack?

9704 2018-08-29 01:49:02 I mean you're no oil painting yourself but is anyone disputing your right to exist?
9705 2018-08-29 01:48:46 The World should boycott Saudis en masse. Don't buy their oil, freeze their assets and expel their diplomats. Allah o Akbar! Inshallah!

9707 2018-08-29 01:47:50 Look on youtube for drip oil heaters. Or recycle at auto parts places.
9708 2018-08-29 01:47:45 Man my whole phone dropped in oil bruh 
9709 2018-08-29 01:47:37 Venezuela's incompetence and corruption crippled their economy. How the heck are US sanctions even a part of this discussion when America buys over a third of their oil exports?
9710 2018-08-29 01:47:37 oil-based iirc,, creams and stuff.... and if u find that ur oil on ur face is like breaking down the foundation translucent setting powder helps tons especially for me ^^
9711 2018-08-29 01:47:34 Don’t tell me Kim Jong-Un is going to fire nuclear weapons. The price of oil increases; water will be contaminated by pollutants released; air pollution returns due to coal; and asbestos use from Putin/Russia the aforementioned violence has already begun.
9712 2018-08-29 01:47:27 Meh.  Lucas Oil Stadium has virtually no on-site parking and I never had trouble getting to Colts games.
9713 2018-08-29 01:47:13 It also shows career politicians need a new career other than being bought by oil and gas
9714 2018-08-29 01:47:13 was on an insta account called tasty "healthy" and they immediately added two tbsp of olive oil and a stick of butter to a pasta dish that needed NEITHER. what kind of false advertising...
9715 2018-08-29 01:47:06 You gotta check out the Invisibility Cloak bath oil at Blush. Those shits are essential in my book for any believers in the cozy boy lifestyle.
9716 2018-08-29 01:46:42 Ladies, gentlemen, heck anybody. What kind of oil y’all use for y’all scalp?
9717 2018-08-29 01:46:39 Id still make em. It’s not like it’s eggs that or expired or oil expired lol
9718 2018-08-29 01:46:37 OOO ye i get that, when I’m not active my face is dry too,, so usually I use moisturizer etc for the dry skin then oil blotters for the oily t-zone, not rly on the topic of foundation i guess BUT moisturizer smoothes out application of it,, if it’s more dry you’d wanna use more

9721 2018-08-29 01:46:29 yeah one thing i advocate as a pure experiment is to attempt to down lotsa lettuce with a sauce made only of oil. like 2x a reasonable quantity of lettuce and 4x a reasonable quantity of oil. nothing else. then observe your satiety minute by minute in the following two hours
9722 2018-08-29 01:46:23 Steel Pipe exports to US not with standing the tariffs imposed by Trump..a story emerging there courtesy US Shale oil industry. Story can last for a decade at the least
9723 2018-08-29 01:46:23 My wife's truck oil change is $300. Fiat requires EU spec synthetic oil and it holds 12 quarts. The oil filter is also a cartridge that is $60.
9724 2018-08-29 01:46:22 I worked on some super high profiled Petroleum cases 
with big wigs from Midland Texas, back when I was a Trial Technician. 
I worked on a MAJOR oil invention case that involved the Rothchilds & Goldman Sachs. And yes, most people don't have a clue about "the economy"
9725 2018-08-29 01:46:11 Already in the oven with some lavender balsamic oil 
9726 2018-08-29 01:45:56 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
9727 2018-08-29 01:45:36 besides the unending oil that I was thinking of, Jesus's first miracle WAS turning water into wine
9728 2018-08-29 01:45:27 well we're bout 90 days from going to mars now.... oil algorithm has tested for last month at near 100% & I've personally tested the trading rules on oil live alerts feed w/ well over 90% win rate (near 100%)... so we're over hump... big deal in our biz, very big #oil $CL_F $WTI
9729 2018-08-29 01:45:27 The only wall he might build is a sea wall to protect oil refineries along the gulf. Guess who’ll pay?
9730 2018-08-29 01:45:19 Yes. Very moderate and ACTUALLY wants to better his city/ state. Also- he was t endorsed by “big oil” so that was seen as a plus in some circles and OBVIOUSLY as a negative in the old school “policy for sale” circles. Went to Kevin Stitt a biz guy from Tulsa and im baffled.
9731 2018-08-29 01:45:16 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
9732 2018-08-29 01:45:09 people ask me why i want a piece of wax paper when i get a slice a pizza, and well the truth is that i like it to soak up the oil and when i'm done i open up the crust and then dip it in the oil that has accumulated. #YEAHISAIDTHAT #PIZZA #PIZZADEN #IHATEPPLWHODABTHEOILOFF!!
9733 2018-08-29 01:45:05 This coffee seed oil I ordered to test in some of my Etsy shop products smells terrible and it's the most perfect thing I've seen all day.
9734 2018-08-29 01:44:58 Fine line between 'just enough chili oil' and 'oh I have chapped lips and asthma now' and Boy Howdy did I sail over it.
9735 2018-08-29 01:44:46 Couldn't the "Equal Time Rule" for TV and radio, and/or the Monopoly Laws eg. Standard Oil, Ma Bell be put to use here?
9736 2018-08-29 01:44:35 Damn....these are some amazing photos that definitely show off your gorgeous body. So you need to stay overed in oil all the time

9738 2018-08-29 01:43:58 This President deregulated oil, clean Air, clean water, and general safety measures everywhere. But he doesn’t like the facts about him when doing a general google search so he wants to regulate the internet.
9739 2018-08-29 01:43:57 LMAOOOOOO oil that nigga up before he has a breakdown on you
9740 2018-08-29 01:43:29 Until you can see someone, try a high quality CBD oil. there may be a chemical imbalance that makes you feel that way.
9741 2018-08-29 01:43:28 Look at what America,Britain and France is doing to Syria,give terrorist chemicals to kill Syrians and blame it on President Assad,and then bomb and kill him,and then steal the oil fields and then move in with Exon Mobil, BP and Total,but the S300 and S400 ICBM is waiting.
9742 2018-08-29 01:43:23 I NEED TO BE LAYING ON A BEACH FEELING THE SUN ON MY SKIN WHILE I LISTEN TO THE BEAUTIFUL OCEAN SOUND WITH A SANGRIA IN ONE HAND AND MY TANNING OIL IN THE OTHER. OKAY THANKS.
9743 2018-08-29 01:43:09 So this is what a  wreck looks like.
Butts team thought(Hoped) Trump would go after oil exports and got Blindsided by auto exports. 

Auto plants can be moved south but oil in ground can’t!

Wasn’t #NAFTA a bilateral deal with  and  till Mulroney got  involved
9744 2018-08-29 01:43:04 #MuhammadTheMerciful
The world is standing on the brink of war, the inter religious crisis will work as oil, and the enemies of this world, terrorist will use this for their fascinating purposes and will blow up global and regional efforts to eliminate terrorism and extremism.
9745 2018-08-29 01:43:00 Does Mr. Carter remember his failed energy policies, the oil embargo, gas lines & alternating days by tag number? (WE DO)- Does he remember the Prime Lending rate over 14%? (WE DO)- Does he remember Iran playing his passivity like a harp, while tormenting our citizens? WE DO!
9746 2018-08-29 01:42:49 He talking about “I need new oil this.  Maintenance”.  Boyyyy if you don’t take this gas and shut up.
9747 2018-08-29 01:42:42 Also, it’s times like this that I know I have anxiety because regular people don’t get this stressed about an oil change. Like I’m watching Netflix comedy specials to keep my mind occupied
9748 2018-08-29 01:42:38 Hazmat - Middletown, NJ: Multiple containers found on trail, believed to be motor oil. County Haz-Mat response has been requested as well as DEP. #1236774
9749 2018-08-29 01:42:30 Had to get an oil change after work and I’m sitting here waiting for them to finish dozing off.... wake me when it’s over plz 
9750 2018-08-29 01:42:28 Why not?  BIG Pharma, Ag, Oil, Chemical and military contractors get free tax money.
9751 2018-08-29 01:42:17 Ah but the AK Permanent Fund is a political binder too. The Fund collects returns from the oil mined in the state, and gives the money to state citizens. It helps to foster voter support for oil mining in AK.
9752 2018-08-29 01:42:17 In other words, we can continue to use oil, while at the same time advocate for using it less, more responsibly, and have those who profit from it also pay to clean up spills.
9753 2018-08-29 01:42:11 sudah tau cara tanning tanpa perlu beli tanning oil, berjemur dsb, KKN saja kak trus ikut merti dusun reog-an langsung tan niscaya:)
9754 2018-08-29 01:41:53 I would like to know what is in Canola oil!
9755 2018-08-29 01:41:41 Maybe instead of a gas can, they will recall Dennis "oil can" Boyd...
9756 2018-08-29 01:41:14 If we had an AG with a backbone, he would threaten to Standard Oil them and they would jump in line.
9757 2018-08-29 01:40:48 Totally get that. I figure I save $40 or so combined on both trucks we have. I'm fanatical about changing it on schedule and will take them in if we're super busy or it's very cold outside. IMHO, regular oil changes are the most important thing you can do to make them last.
9758 2018-08-29 01:40:29 open your mouth
9759 2018-08-29 01:40:19 เสียดายเนอะ แต่สังเกตน้องเพิร์ธไม่ค่อยมีรูปคู่กับเซ้นเลย แฟนเขาไม่ลงรูปคู่ในไอจีหรอกเนอะ ลงแต่กับเพื่อน 55555 #มโนแปบ
9760 2018-08-29 01:40:13 Endless oil story
9761 2018-08-29 01:40:09 Came to get an oil change at Walmart and the lady charged someone else for what they did to my car and I just want to pay and go home 
9762 2018-08-29 01:40:08 it is! I don't have the patience for oil or the delicacy for watercolor xD
9763 2018-08-29 01:40:07 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
9764 2018-08-29 01:40:03 I understand on that one x.x My mom used to use an oil called PNS (think that’s it) due to how bad mine got when I was a kid (97% head to toe coverage) but any treatments suck entirely just to keep it from interfering with work/daily life :/
9765 2018-08-29 01:39:51 親って大変なんだな・・・（可愛い）＞RT
9766 2018-08-29 01:39:45 coconut oil, do ur thing and fix all my probs!!
9767 2018-08-29 01:39:42 One of the worst moments of my life was walking into a brand new KC bbq place and seeing a magnificent plate of onion straws, only to find out everything was fried in peanut oil.
9768 2018-08-29 01:39:40 extremely fancy facial oil is so weird, it's like 80$ a bottle but feels like slapping olive oil on your face haha (i just tried a sample)
9769 2018-08-29 01:39:34 New sydnet shampoo bars  made with hemp seed oil, India pale ale, coconut oil & scs noodles fragrances with coconut lime verbena
9770 2018-08-29 01:39:31 It was great for my afro when Iived in a more humid climate. Now that I live in the desert, my hair just gets dry when I use coconut oil. Have stepped it back to avocado or grapeseed oil instead.
9771 2018-08-29 01:39:30 Get vonk out now now shares fom the BOD
9772 2018-08-29 01:39:28 Even worse. The proceeds of oil sales from the Niger Delta will be paid to Niger Republic to buy their oil and refine in Katsina
9773 2018-08-29 01:39:14 biasanya kalo abis pake porepack, sekitaran idung ku tuh kayak perih gitu (kalo jawanya sih nedas) nah itu kukasih baby oil

9776 2018-08-29 01:38:39 @AndrewGillum won while:

1. sticking to his values. 
2. the support of grassroots organizers who canvased the state
3. championing expanded Medicare and legalizing marijuana 
4. A greasy forehead because of the anointing oil being applied by his grandmother
9777 2018-08-29 01:38:38 telling lies?
9778 2018-08-29 01:38:35 baby oil is magic!
9779 2018-08-29 01:38:29 In this case, beard oil. 
9780 2018-08-29 01:38:23 Put tea tree oil on some blemishes, including my nose.
Sneezed. Wiped nose. Face is now on fire.
9781 2018-08-29 01:38:11 Standard Oil them.

9783 2018-08-29 01:37:46 Heyo what kind of oil is it?
9784 2018-08-29 01:37:39 Stupid comment but if Trump gets his way and lines our shores with oil/gas rigs disrupting marine life and the fishing/ shrimp industry and tourism, not to mention closing of businesses statewide due to tarrifs...who knows. If Trump wants to talk "shitholes" look at Atlantic City
9785 2018-08-29 01:37:39 Rick Scott should be fronting a Midnight Oil tribute band Then we would know he was making honest $
9786 2018-08-29 01:37:36 I’m not sure if it’s the air, cbd oil, or this time restricted eating I’ve been doing but I haven’t been this happy in months even though everything is falling apart around me 
9787 2018-08-29 01:37:25 this whole “adulting” thing is lame. get my paycheck tomorrow and i’ll have to pay car insurance, new windshield wipers, oil change and a tank of gas. i’ll enjoy my 2 dollars.
9788 2018-08-29 01:37:17 @realDonaldTrump stop running the country like a business and do what needs to be done. Give shelter to the homeless, give food to the poor, get rid of illegals, drill for our own oil in the U.S.A, legalize pot and bring back the hemp industry, give every citizen over 21 a gun.
9789 2018-08-29 01:37:01 On no man, use an old wooden hockey stick and screw the bottom half of a 1 litre oil jug to it.
9790 2018-08-29 01:36:54 Tell me why big pharma sells cold medication made out of man-made chemicals that are dangerous to consume unless it's concocted perfectly into a pharmaceutical drug, meanwhile I just took a natural peppermint oil and it cleared my congestion and headache almost immediately 
9791 2018-08-29 01:36:53 Yes!! For me at least lol. Not so much with my candle and plug in I just like the smell lol. But my essential oil of lavender works better than NyQuil or Benadryl in my opinion.
9792 2018-08-29 01:36:51 asal putih sgt kau sekarang azhar,hahaha....guna body shop tea tree oil
9793 2018-08-29 01:36:47 Well I certainly can’t take all the credit. @kevinmaloney81 burned a lot of midnight oil working on it and we have some great designers that helped our covers come to life.
9794 2018-08-29 01:36:43 Subsidy given to oil companies. Just compare oil prices at UPA regime and NDA regime. Now 100% tax on petrol price by both state and central government.
9795 2018-08-29 01:36:41 すいません
寝ぼけてましたw
9796 2018-08-29 01:36:40 Grapeseed oil for me. Its a light oil for my low porosity hair.
9797 2018-08-29 01:36:40 @JustinTrudeau ps as the US only has 10 more years of oil and Nat gas, per EIA, that market will come back
9798 2018-08-29 01:36:32 Can someone come oil my scalp 
9799 2018-08-29 01:36:24 I had coconut oil in my hair all day AND just deep conditioned it. A bitch is SOFT
9800 2018-08-29 01:36:16 That is why you sell oil for living
9801 2018-08-29 01:36:13 Funny you mention that! I am switching over after this bottle of fish oil is done.  I am an affiliate for Onnit and the have great krill oil! If you want 10% off let me know. How was that pitch? 
9802 2018-08-29 01:36:10 FYI eating a snack of diced, raw red onion with a bit of kosher salt, pepper, and oil, although tasty, will give you instant nightmarish indigestion and heartburn.

9805 2018-08-29 01:35:50 The NDA government repaid over Rs 2 lakh crore, including Rs 70,000 crore interest, which was taken as a loan through oil bonds by the previous Congress government at the Centre, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan

9809 2018-08-29 01:35:19 Oh, definitely. It's not really burned. Just dark in spots, which I think I'll always get cooking it in a cast iron skillet. But it does have the flavor of overheated oil. Not my best work ever.
9810 2018-08-29 01:35:04 Full Spectrum Hemp Oil is a great solution also... @RestoreBotanic makes some great ones... check ‘em out.
9811 2018-08-29 01:34:46 Aw shoot I hate that. I recently started taking CBD oil/melatonin to help me sleep bc of anxiety and it works but I’d say talk to a doctor before trying that
9812 2018-08-29 01:34:46 @JustinTrudeau re NAFTA, we send 3.5M bbls of oil a day to US at a deep discount, they're ripping us off on price, so as they tariffed lumber we must put a 25% tariff on that oil; when the pipelines in the Permian we will lose that market anyways so nothing to lose
9813 2018-08-29 01:34:18 ふぎょぎょ最近皆さん、がはははは…‥…………返し、とな！
9814 2018-08-29 01:33:50 Why should we?  They burned that bridge. Canada top country for diversity and they treat us with disrespect.  Next they will want us to buy oil again.   Pff

9816 2018-08-29 01:33:34 The Middle East has always held a unique importance to US diplomatic interests. Many of our allies depend on the oil in the area, not to mention Israel.
9817 2018-08-29 01:33:28 Trump removed job killing regulations putting coal and iron miners back to work.removed regulations on natural gas, now the USA IS A MAJOR GAS AND OIL EXPORTER.Corps are moving back to USA because of GOP TAX PLAN. unemployment LOWEST ever.
9818 2018-08-29 01:33:25 I wasted coconut oil all in my drawer 
9819 2018-08-29 01:33:17 Honestly, is CDB oil expensive because its a complicated process or are people just striking while its a hot trend?
9820 2018-08-29 01:33:13 You're conveniently ignoring a lot of history here Mikey Mike -- which is completely consistent with your sanctified snake oil salesman approach to leadership and your Eddie Haskell style people skills. Give it up.

9824 2018-08-29 01:32:41 No, I live in the district, she is an awful rep who has the exact same mentality as others - give tax cuts to the rich, cut services to the poor, deny climate change, give money to oil companies - what is "Swinging" about this?

9831 2018-08-29 01:32:06 I knew I was a fatass because My professor asked us what was the worst thing about McDonald’s and a student had the audacity to say “The oil because we never change it. I work there” and it didn’t phase me.

9834 2018-08-29 01:31:48 So I really hate the scent of the body oil I bought but I love the body butter so maybe I'll like give the oil to someone else since I only used legit 3 drops of it
9835 2018-08-29 01:31:31 No, different creature. McConnell is a TURDle. At one time I lived in the subtropics & we had lg land tortoises that left behind logs of tar that was slicker than snot on a doorknob, kinda smelled like 90 weight gear oil. The kids thought they were fun until they slipped in it.
9836 2018-08-29 01:31:20 Peel a tomato, chop it in pieces, also cut some onion in really really freaking thin slices, add salt, a tiny bit of oil (not olive, i don’t like the taste of it with tomatoes), mix it. Best fucking salad to go with your protein.

9874 2018-08-29 01:23:22 So your decision would be to shut down the coal industry due to a minuscule risk of impact to the reef from shipping? Ridiculous. 

Why not go one step further, shut down all oil refineries on the coast, shut down all highways that go within 50m of a natural wetland too.

9879 2018-08-29 01:22:40 There are millions of progressives in Texas who are tired of allowing their state to be controlled by right wing extremists and oil industry apologists. @BetoORourke has a very sound opportunity to win a game changing Texas election and take back power from white supremacists.
9880 2018-08-29 01:22:39 John, Since Hemp can not only be used for thousands of products its can also produce CBD Oil which many believe is non habit forming. Helps reduce Opioid use for pain, PTSD especialy Veterans & dozens of other medicinal uses. Very profitable crop for MI farmers.
9881 2018-08-29 01:22:30 Olive oil is such an evil thing. It can be put into so many things without knowing about it and it’s so high in calories. It’s honestly terrifying to me.

9912 2018-08-29 01:16:27 The general rule, according to the EIA, is that about two-thirds of your cost of gas at the pump is determined by crude oil cost. The rest is a combination of taxes, refining, distribution and marketing. These are ultimately just some of the 11 factors we determined influence gas
9913 2018-08-29 01:16:20 Groups who have studied the issue are concerned abt you voting to block extra spills to help the endangered salmon. We know your concern for our beautiful Wa state is nearly zero. How many of your constituents know that you support offshore oil & gas drilling?

9919 2018-08-29 01:15:47 They make all of these essential oils for a diffuser with scents like eucalyptus, frankincense, and lavender, but I would much rather come home to a house that smells like negroni, thom yum soup, or yucca with salsa verde. Get with it, hippie essential oil producers!

9921 2018-08-29 01:15:27 Yet again right wing skynews will not report the truth why socialist venezuela is going through this crisis, its because of the ' sanctions ' by the capitalist US who wants all the oil gold and gas the US is stopping everything getting into venezuela
9922 2018-08-29 01:15:24 I agree. But it's a serious question. Can we create revenue from geothermal plants? Could that revenue be anything like what we could get from oil?

9927 2018-08-29 01:14:36 I think that you would want to look at gummies with CBG and hash oil concentrates with CBG-A. The naturally occurring cabergolines aid in reducing swelling and retarding tumor growth. My endocrinologist prescribed a synthetic one for my pituitary after brain surgery.

9931 2018-08-29 01:14:20 So if you have a meal consisting of  coconut oil (widely used in certain Indian cooking for millennia) fried cous cous, Miso Soup, and red wine, each individually part of healthy cuisines, it may go down badly (esp if one’s Native genetics/biome is not suited for it).
9932 2018-08-29 01:14:13 I swear I’ve got to be Italian or like Spanish because the smell of olive oil turns me on

9945 2018-08-29 01:11:45 I just loved how @adamcarolla showed what a fraud he truly is.  Like when he said he was raised by a single mom, trying to equate himself to ghetto children, to have Adam bring out that his dad was actually a general counsel for Getty Oil and paying support out the wazzu.
9946 2018-08-29 01:11:02 It's a known tactic of oil companies making the government unstable with bribes so they can buy the oil creap. 
They do the same to get cheap precious minerals from African countries.

9980 2018-08-29 01:07:17 Dave let's get you a mic next time so that there's not so much background noise. Also way to go coddling the oil industry in the new curriculum you bootlicker
9981 2018-08-29 01:06:53 "Money, war, oil" is one of those cliches people who think they're well informed but in reality have no understanding of political theory or analysis vomit out to boost their egos and try and seem cynical and cool. You wrote something false. Retract it.
9982 2018-08-29 01:06:49 I've heard of people getting shafted with those mini oil pumps. They turn them off, or lie about the actual production.
9983 2018-08-29 01:06:41 You prepare a table before me
   in the presence of my enemies;
   you anoint my head with oil;
   my cup overflows. 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   all the days of my life,
   and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
FOREVER. 
9984 2018-08-29 01:06:34 He bent over backwards to obstruct her. 
Call them liars when they lie. 
Why is the guy responsible for snake oil being sold as medicine lying about a hypothetical even news? 
What about the kids who are still separated? 
What about the Puerto Rico dead? #FamiliesBelongTogether

9986 2018-08-29 01:06:10 How do I still not own a can opener or have coconut oil in my pantry? This is EXACTLY why I only cook once a year. #adultingwithlaura
9987 2018-08-29 01:05:48 The oil wealth, here they ignore it's taxpayers money

9991 2018-08-29 01:04:58 Lmao what do they do put oil on the bottom of his shoes? This happens ALOT 
9992 2018-08-29 01:04:57 Really?.. the same way how the "stimulus" was supposed to bring jobs back and it didn't?... That bill included higher taxes on the wealthy and on oil companies.  What liberals/democrats like yourself fail to understand to this day is that if you increase taxes on those who...
9993 2018-08-29 01:04:16 Another dirty secret: you can get oil and filters for nearly anything from Amazon.
9994 2018-08-29 01:04:13 I have regular, roasted garlic, cracked pepper & olive oil, garden herb and fig & honey.
9995 2018-08-29 01:03:49 We had sea lice, oil, coal, & petrified peat in the water and ground surf clams and mole crabs.
9996 2018-08-29 01:03:44 That’s what the essential oil people all say too
9997 2018-08-29 01:03:34 Castor oil helped me.
9998 2018-08-29 01:03:01 yeah .. this must be the very oil that modern society runs on...
9999 2018-08-29 01:02:25 When you get an email that your husband changed your oil and lamp lights 
10000 2018-08-29 01:02:04 Haha what a joke let’s institute carbon taxes and red tape on domestic pipelines!! All while still producing and selling our oil n gas at pennies on the dollar and import Saudi oil etc ! Genius! #SaveThePlanet dummies

10002 2018-08-29 01:01:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms! Greyhound buses don’t run on gasoline, they run on melted greyhound dogs! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
10003 2018-08-29 01:01:46 There are some wealthy people who see the stupidity of voting republican. Good economies come from good jobs and a strong base. Usually those people made their money from creative businesses that don’t cut corners. Oil,gas, military contractors and pharmaceuticals are not include
10004 2018-08-29 01:01:38 Me: *hitting my vape with maple syrup flavored oil*
My roommate: damn everything you make stays smelling good

10006 2018-08-29 01:01:30 Interesting how that decline coincided with the trough of the Alberta recession. It’s like taxable incomes (especially at the highest rates) fell along with the price of oil. 

Former provincial politicians virtue-signalling with misleading analysis does nothing for Canada.
10007 2018-08-29 01:01:21 Do you put any oil on your scalp?
