2 2018-07-10 23:59:42 Part of the reason Russian wanted Crimea is to Seaport for their ships plus they don't have to pay a tax to Crimea for shipping their oil through there it's all about money. Have you ever heard Trump say one word about Russia shouldn't be in Crimea? Does Putin give kickbacks?
3 2018-07-10 23:59:33 If the road sections are made from oil based plastic,To cover all roads  would deplete all the words oil reserves. How would you  then make replacements for repairs  we are try to get rid of plastic in the environment not potentially make things worse

5 2018-07-10 23:59:05 All US led sanctions cost partners a lot. The North Korea sanctions cost China a lot. Thanks? Tariffs. The 0 Iranian oil doctrine will cost India lots if they follow, at the moment they trade oil against goods. It's funny that US sees itself as a victim in a world created by US

12 2018-07-10 23:58:05 My education suffered from the cuts Klein made because he was hysterical about debt. My family suffered from a cancer center operating obove capacity because oil revs dropped and we decided it could wait 20 yrs. Now the cost is significantly higher due to deterioration+inflation

14 2018-07-10 23:58:00 NEVER brush your hair.
I swear by Shea Moisture. I use the full line: curl & style shampoo and condition, curl enhancing smoothie, and hold & shine moisture mist.
I will change it up w/other shampoos/conditioners (using an argan oil one now that is nice), but always the smoothie

34 2018-07-10 23:57:05 Lynn, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how you enjoy obstructing #LGBTQ oil and enriching dictator’s #bloodoil
35 2018-07-10 23:57:02 Sounds reasonable to me, although they’d have to be on the thin side and use a decent amount of oil

あ、おはようございます。今日も不元気におちごとです。
38 2018-07-10 23:56:51 Renewable energy must be a strategy, not simply a reaction each time oil prices rise. Renewables are a necessity, not an option. They are environmentally friendly. They create  jobs. They are the future.  Demand long term solutions from your elected officials.
39 2018-07-10 23:56:45 Hey now, Uncle Steve, we're not ALL hayseeds and oil barons down here...even in a political minority, hope springs eternal. Don'tcha know? #VoteBeto

43 2018-07-10 23:55:41 We all benefit, from royalties to taxes this will benefit Canada’s healthcare, education systems, all government funded infrastructure which includes roads, urban public transit sytems. Plus it will fund research and development of green technology that will in turn phase out oil
44 2018-07-10 23:55:28 If that land had oil or minerals everyone of those ranchers would be dead or in jail Ask Zinke
45 2018-07-10 23:55:21 Manicure question: when the manicurist puts you under the dryer are they supposed to let you know when it's dry and add cuticle oil?
46 2018-07-10 23:55:13 And God created oil, but needed humans to create plastic ...

58 2018-07-10 23:53:07 Whatever you do, don't cover yourself in butter thinking its tanning oil. Did that once by mistake and whooooo boy
59 2018-07-10 23:52:40 #TuesdayThoughts: Only think abt what u want, best case not worst as #Manifestation energy is high! Pal: “put this oil on ur lashes.” Then we workout in& I think “Watch me get a sty.” I forgot to “cancel, clear, delete!” Sure enough, 1st #sty in yrs. #EclipseSeason
60 2018-07-10 23:52:31 And if Putin tells you to go to war with Venezuela to get the oil  he’s going to lie to you just like you lied to us you won’t get oil you will get a blackeye
61 2018-07-10 23:52:23 Pshh. I think I’m getting the Monte Carlo out this weekend. Gotta put new tires on, oil change, coolant flush, power steering fluid and possibly a new battery. After all that it might run.
62 2018-07-10 23:52:21 Wonder if it's the one who works for Tacten Industrial Inc, an industrial supplier for the oil and gas industry. Pitiful response regardless.
63 2018-07-10 23:52:12 Might pivot this to a CBD oil scam account.
64 2018-07-10 23:52:11 セミ兄貴は朝から元気だな
65 2018-07-10 23:52:10 @BetteMidler wen it starts raining sawdust maybe trump will understand global warming. Until then an oil rig in every backyard n a coal mine in every park.
66 2018-07-10 23:52:05 I roast them in the oven with Avocado Oil and lightly sprinkled with Sea Salt and some pepper! Mmmm
67 2018-07-10 23:51:58 Know what the gas chamber smell like Jake? Pine oil
68 2018-07-10 23:51:55 Have you tried oil-pulling?  Put some organic olive, coconut, sesame, hemp, etc. oil in your mouth and swish gently for 10 - 20 minutes.  Spit out.  Repeat as often as possible.
69 2018-07-10 23:51:53 I just use eggs and sunflower oil ... I'm basic
70 2018-07-10 23:51:46 Why is life doing this to me right now... WHY.... I don’t wanna get an oil change :/
71 2018-07-10 23:51:24 I’d say it’d have to be oil based whatever you do, MDF is susceptible to expanding with water based products :(
72 2018-07-10 23:51:15 oil paints reeeeally test my patience and my grasp of color even more so,,, but tests my posture the most
73 2018-07-10 23:51:15 No you didn’t. Just like you lied about oil production going up and prices coming down. More blatant lies.

77 2018-07-10 23:51:07 I can smell the lavender oil through the packaging box. I am going to be so livid if the bottle broke.
78 2018-07-10 23:51:05 Most start w acrylic or watercolor. Oil painting is more expensive & more effort to clean the brushes. You used to draw a lot - maybe start w watercolor pencils to get back into the swing of things? If you like that look, then go w watercolor next. If you want bolder, go acrylic.
79 2018-07-10 23:51:00 soooo either im alrdy gettin too old 4 dis shit or im jus late but apparently today (710) is oil day

Can you fix my car? Change my oil? 
Can you build my house? 
Can you fix my plumbing? 
Can you give me some amazing, elite offspring? 
Can you provide 100% of bills and take us on 2 family vacations a year? 

Ok didn’t think so

94 2018-07-10 23:49:52 Coconut oil pulling is life. It whitens your teeth, removes bacteria and is more effective than flossing. Get with it ppl
95 2018-07-10 23:49:43 I can’t wait to get home from work and slather my body in coconut oil
96 2018-07-10 23:49:31 I have been soaking coconut oil in my hair for 4 hours now
97 2018-07-10 23:49:13 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
98 2018-07-10 23:48:56 That’s obama through and through. Snake oil salesman. If the establishment did half the investigation on him as they are trump the American people would know what true corruption is.
99 2018-07-10 23:48:29 I haven’t put oil in my car in a year I’m done for
100 2018-07-10 23:48:25 So deep I found oil 
101 2018-07-10 23:48:19 You are a con man, not a Republican. Snake oil.
102 2018-07-10 23:47:50 Getting my oil changed by myself for the first time and I am feelin’ v uncomfortable and dumb.
103 2018-07-10 23:47:47 Well it is rich in oil and tourism.
104 2018-07-10 23:47:42 mct oil tastes a little bit like chapstick but I'm getting used to it.
105 2018-07-10 23:47:40 Getting an oil changed after work all on my own, my mom didn’t even have to ask me 500 times. Is..is this..me growing up.
106 2018-07-10 23:47:35 Swishing coconut oil in my mouth for 20 min
107 2018-07-10 23:47:32 Take a baby oil bath.
108 2018-07-10 23:47:02 If we’re being honest, salads are just a CBD oil delivery system for me at this point
109 2018-07-10 23:47:00 Is that in the same way the Saudi king said he was gonna increase oil production, and opec lowering their price per barrel? Those haven't worked out so well for you.
110 2018-07-10 23:46:56 we'll see how that works, not working to well with asking the Saudis to pump more oil and get the cost of oil down

113 2018-07-10 23:46:25 Oil!!!!
114 2018-07-10 23:46:14 It’s a false example - Norway has the worlds largest sovereign fund due to oil and a small population with harsh immigration laws. It’s impossible for that to be replicated here. Our GDP and opportunities are as good as they are here BECAUSE of capitalism.
115 2018-07-10 23:46:05 biotin pills, lower the amount of fat in your diet if too high, add more turmeric/black pepper to your diet, change up your skin care routine with “cleaner/simple” products like jojoba oil for moisturizer
116 2018-07-10 23:45:58 We rx CBD/hemp oil in the best form & dose & from legitimate sources:
- Clear ingredient labeling
- COA for verifying quality/labeling
- CBD listed in mg/bottle/dose
- Hemp oil extracted with SC CO2 (best) or ETOH
- Organically grown limits contaminants
- MCT/EVOO as carrier fat
117 2018-07-10 23:45:53 Easy solution. Whole plant CBD oil.
118 2018-07-10 23:45:43 the rituals of worship you do where does it come from?
babylojn (swaha throw (oil/powder mix is thrown) when you don't understand why you do sometrhing you do it because it is done, that is a ritual
119 2018-07-10 23:45:43 Cool, is that a pump yourself washing machine? I do a wash with  essential oil to help get the bleach smell out.
120 2018-07-10 23:45:38 Yes, it can benefit us by cheap goods all dressed up but nowhere to go. The Iran-US showdown could spike up oil however and cripple us.
121 2018-07-10 23:45:19 Observing that a timeframe for oil is about up this week - top 2013 to bottom 2016 now reflected out.
122 2018-07-10 23:45:12 What are you supposed to do with olive oil?? Put it on your face?!

124 2018-07-10 23:45:07 I’d wear a pad when you do that or if you do that cause the oil will stain your clothes or sheets
125 2018-07-10 23:45:07 I got the anointing oil and some healing hands... yo, we can do this!
126 2018-07-10 23:45:03 No more straws!! Unless it's the big kind carrying oil
127 2018-07-10 23:44:52 Dude's a Snake Oil peddler, sorry you got hit by this shit sir.
128 2018-07-10 23:44:29 Hot rag. Tea tree oil
129 2018-07-10 23:44:25 Greenpeace has NO! Clue how serious the companies in the Oil Sands take environmental standards. Go knock on Trumps door and see how that goes. Go to the Golden Gate Bridge and hang from it, see what happens. I hope these people that get charged think it was worth it.

133 2018-07-10 23:44:15 Y'know... if the government happened to have $5.3 billion kicking around, they could have probably used some of it to buy out Greyhound instead of subsidizing oil billionaires. #ableg #greyhoundcanada @albertaNDP

137 2018-07-10 23:44:01 You are lying. When you and Obasanjo were the President and Vice, why never implemented restructuring? You are only interested in becoming Nigeria President, so that you can be in the position of Charing Oil revenue(money). Why not do like Dangote, creating wealth everywhere.

144 2018-07-10 23:43:20 Is it the numbers that confuse you?  You don't believe that the price of oil during the budget period was $53.69?  Where's the disconnect for you?

148 2018-07-10 23:43:09 Great painting @buske_natalie! I really want to pick up painting. I used to draw a lot, but have been out for a very long time. Do you only do oil painting? Is it a good media to start with in learning to paint?
149 2018-07-10 23:42:59 For me it’s a visual thing it’s a turn on but it don’t really feel like nuffin. Maybe I’ll try it with the baby oil

151 2018-07-10 23:42:51 @BP_plc so like we water the oil and it will gestate into more oil …...slow but over time build up nd what ever u add to it …..we not making beer here u put an egg in a jug and it be flammable or iz sulfer just a smell I cant remember people just say white phosphorus to me alot
152 2018-07-10 23:42:27 But for the rise in oil prices in the 70s; the introduction of Saudi/gulf reactionary fundamentalism & the death of Nasser the Middle East would be a substantially different place. You ever read about Hafez el Assad and Henry Kissinger? Tragic story.

155 2018-07-10 23:41:32 I see that your oil company payoffs are still coming in.
156 2018-07-10 23:41:19 A8: Roasted veggies...cut up, glaze with olive oil, 405F oven for 30 minutes. Remove from sheet.  Great in fridge for a few days reheated as sides.  #healthyaging #ucarenet

162 2018-07-10 23:40:04 Spilled some black truffle oil, wiped it up with a paper towel, and now my trash can smells AMAZING.
163 2018-07-10 23:40:02 I used their argan oil first but prefer the rose hip oil
164 2018-07-10 23:40:01 So we can expect the same result as when you demanded oil output increase, higher prices. Please leave these things alone, everything you discuss or touch becomes a disaster.
165 2018-07-10 23:39:52 It's not unsettled except for the big oil shills who put profits before EVERYTHING.

170 2018-07-10 23:39:17 Crores. So oil tax collection = entire nation's direct taxes. Tax on one litre petrol in 2013 was 5rs, today = 35rs..of course you would say
171 2018-07-10 23:39:16 And yea, I might take an EV mandate but would still want oil under the price or trading program (preferably the latter).
172 2018-07-10 23:38:55 "A crash course on the history of oil taxes" would be incomplete without mentioning the VECO scandal. Do you disagree?
173 2018-07-10 23:38:48 And this is how zinke threw out years of review that made Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante and shrunk them to sell off to oil and gas cronies.
174 2018-07-10 23:38:36 MORNING 
- cleanse your face (I prefer oil cleansers, but I think they all work!) 

- exfoliate (you don’t need any expensive things, just a damp warm cloth and rub in smal circles around face) 

- tone your face 
-moisturizer 
- primer
175 2018-07-10 23:38:35 Tomorrow I have an appointment to take my @chevrolet #Tahoe in for an oil change and tire rotation. The dealer says ‘at 40,000 miles we recommend a brake line flush.’ Really? WTF! I suppose I do look like I fell off a turnip truck, but not this week. #DealerMarkup #Packing
176 2018-07-10 23:38:33 Who got oil cartridges for a deal?

180 2018-07-10 23:37:53 There’s always like a 90% chance there’s going to be a cute guy working at square tire when I bring my Jeep in for an oil change. Like yeah here’s my number call me when it’s done, but ALSO call me after you’re off work?? 
181 2018-07-10 23:37:53 but i likes the oil shock as a x-axis starter for Canada. Beginning of a new era!
182 2018-07-10 23:37:47 Pretty good! I cooked them in a little oil and then covered them in BBQ sauce.
183 2018-07-10 23:37:45 @DrGundry Hi Dr. G!
Is Evening Primrose Oil recommended and compliant?
Thank you. :)
184 2018-07-10 23:37:41 Me too! Th only one that sorta works is argon oil but I’ve been too lazy to go to th store and buy some more lol
185 2018-07-10 23:37:34 For the annual period, they created the budget thinking oil would be $55.  Not $75.  Not $30.  Not $100.  $55.  The ACTUAL price during that period was $53.69.  Not $75.  Not $100.  So the increased revenue WASN'T due to higher oil, because oil wasn't higher, was it?  $53 < $55.
186 2018-07-10 23:37:34 Let's be honest here, you can get away with it because there's only 9 blades of grass that aren't covered in motor oil in the 6 foot radius of your trailer home.

That, and your neighbors haven't gone to sleep yet from their NASCAR pregamer.

188 2018-07-10 23:37:25 When Jihad was waged against Spain, Africa, Egypt, Persia under the first four Caliphs there was no America neither there oil was explored in Middle East. These places were attacked to convert kafirs to Islam and sustain Caliphate through loot and Zizya.
189 2018-07-10 23:37:25 oh, don't get me wrong, Hazard is the worst (during the PL season). I can still be impressed at how he rides through multiple tackles though.
France completely negated Belgium's threat. Better team won. And if they were a club side, we'd all be complaining about oil money.
190 2018-07-10 23:37:12 OMG hasn’t Louisiana been destroyed enough by big oil? Look at it on Google Earth it’s being eaten away 
191 2018-07-10 23:36:57 Yup, be it RNH or Leon, one will play with McDavid and rightfully so.
192 2018-07-10 23:36:41 Amazing condition. Was put away last year without cleaning gas. Needs carbs done. Absolutely nothing wrong except for that. New plugs and oil changed ,well maintained . $3000 firm. Not a penny less. Come get it! No trades. Cash only .

198 2018-07-10 23:34:50 Is this like the time he said he “talked” to Saudi Arabia about oil prices and they said they would increase oil production
199 2018-07-10 23:34:47 You may think my hands are dirty because of the egine's oil, but it fact I got stained with eyeliner.
200 2018-07-10 23:34:45 Yeah if you find an alternative that’s fine! Just make sure the only ingredient is the rosehip oil and nothing added
201 2018-07-10 23:34:43 Some Oiler fans like to conveniently put RNH at 3LC when it comes to these strength down the middle comparisons with other teams even though they know full well unless there some drastic change he's playing LW..

205 2018-07-10 23:34:09 I know!!! It got healed bc I had a keloid then I kept using tea tree oil & it had went away , & then it started bleeding again so I was like fuck it lol
206 2018-07-10 23:34:09 Aside from like regular meds, raw almonds actually really help mine! or a tiny bit of lavender essential oil.
207 2018-07-10 23:34:06 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.

209 2018-07-10 23:33:15 Anyone that thinks Putin isn't itching to try out his new oil money infused military against the big boys is fooling themselves. He has seen the US pummel Iraq twice and wants desperately to see his T-90s and T-14s rolling through Europe, daring NATO to take them on.

214 2018-07-10 23:32:28 Oh, @RandPaul, u give us endless reasons to find you immanently hateable. if it isn't taking away childrens' health insurance, or sheltering BP, as oil ran amok into our oceans, it's spitting on the our allies. and cavorting with the enemy.
215 2018-07-10 23:32:17 I’m driving Nana Ava’s car because she can’t drive anymore and my air is out.
Me- Nana when did you get the oil changed last?
Nana- about 3 yrs ago.
Me- WHAT?!
Nana- you only need to change it every 5 yrs.
Me- NO NANA! IT’s EVERY 5,000 MILES! NOT YEARS!
Nana- Are you sure?
Me-

218 2018-07-10 23:31:41 All I'm saying is pick your battles. One one hand you have a guy who made billion in tech and continues to invest on propelling human science.

225 2018-07-10 23:30:42 EVs and urban car bans, for starters. Palm oil bans and/or proof of origin standards. A bunch of food and ag-related stuff that I'm still learning about (but the gist of it is that it's profitable at less than $5 a ton, so, price is not a relevant barrier)

Currently, it's not available here or covered by insurance if you can find it.

242 2018-07-10 23:28:40 I don’t wanna go get my oil changed by myself :( I’m such a child lmao
243 2018-07-10 23:28:40 i swear, half the contestants who get chopped would not have gotten chopped if they had ever watched more than like 2 episodes of the show. why are you using truffle oil? why are you making risotto? why are you serving scott raw red onions??
244 2018-07-10 23:28:07 Is that like the extra 2,000,000 barrels of oil your buddy MBS and his daddy agreed to produce to help hard-working Americans at the pump?  Still haven‘t seen that happening.  My guess, drug prices and gas prices are going nowhere but up.  You can‘t deliver!
245 2018-07-10 23:28:06 I called my dad crying because my truck stopped accelerating on the interstate and I was convinced this was finally The End for my vehicle but nope.... just ate through all the oil 1,000 miles early......
246 2018-07-10 23:27:53 thanks, will do, the oil is kicking in :)

250 2018-07-10 23:27:01 Glad to see this "ban straws" shit is working fam now all we gotta do is get the oil companies and the global industrial machine to stop extracting and utilizing fossil fuels and switch entirely to renewable alternatives within the next decade or so and we'll be good to go
251 2018-07-10 23:26:41 Same.
I knew this was a wide strain in the GOP. It’s why I left iwhen Reagan married the evangelists to get into office. &left the church.
But I thought they cared abt this country.
Wrong. App, the promise of Russian oil money overrides everything they said they stood for.

252 2018-07-10 23:26:20 The context is a bummer. I also think it has something to do with the oil industry, and/or dating Grimes.

Delightful!
259 2018-07-10 23:25:51 Exactly. China really thought that it could throw Trump a bone to shut him up. That's what the increased oil and soybean purchases were about. They are still in denial and they are caught so flat footed.
260 2018-07-10 23:25:45 Yes! This movie is unnerving and eerie.

265 2018-07-10 23:25:04 Hmmm... Current successful youtubers viewing change like this are a little like famous oil companies looking at alternative fuel sources. Obviously the dont want change, and maybe change will hurt us consumers, but they are biased sources of info.

282 2018-07-10 23:22:28 Probably a lie of Trump as well as the price of oil
283 2018-07-10 23:21:58 My hands smell like tacos and it calms me. Take that, lavender essential oil!
284 2018-07-10 23:21:41 I was sitting 4 hour everyday 30 days non stop. Remember when the sweating stop, go cool down the body so you can restart the sweating again. Good mineral and vitamins is important, in grease the doses slowly and good oil and fat. Amazing cure to cleaning the body and mind.
285 2018-07-10 23:21:07 Did you speak to Pfizer the same way you spoke to the Saudi King about the oil prices that you fuxed last week? DIDN’T HAPPEN
286 2018-07-10 23:20:41 Thanks Simon . It’s charred lango with apple pickled kohlrabi, green strawberries, home made 2yr old strawberry wine and sorrel oil , tastes amazing.

289 2018-07-10 23:20:25 @MayorHancock would you kindly offer help? That plant is right next to the oil refinery, power plant, and the plate river. The refuse has a convenient way to contaminate Denver tributaries.
290 2018-07-10 23:20:17 who wants to buy be this 1000 mg bottle of bougie cbd oil and cbd gummies?  I know my potential health is worth the money but my budget is shot for the foreseeable future
291 2018-07-10 23:20:17 They use coconut oil as a main ingredient
292 2018-07-10 23:19:54 Spells “oil” backwards, day of dabbing lmao
293 2018-07-10 23:19:51 ....9/11 was a response to the first gulf war when Saddam occupied Kuwait to use oil reserves as hostage against NATO? What? I’m assuming that’s what you’re referring to, even though those pictures I believe are from the war that started 2 years later?
294 2018-07-10 23:19:35 Saudi Arabia has tons of oil we’re not bombing them, also you’ve not actually provided evidence that war is what spurs the economy we bomb those countries because they are a threat

301 2018-07-10 23:18:35 Cajun roux is vegetable oil and flour and gets very dark. It takes like an hour of nonstop stirring and is easy to burn.
302 2018-07-10 23:18:22 Last night I had a dream that everyone was getting annoyed with me because I wouldn’t shut up about how much a love olive oil and how it’s an essential ??
303 2018-07-10 23:18:18 Do U remember when oil prices were $140 a barrel? T Boone Pickens certainly does. He personally lost $50Million investing in alternative energy when the price dropped 2 $40 a barrel. Most of the increase in gas price is due 2 State & local tax increases given the robust economy
304 2018-07-10 23:18:13 "1.5 month growth. I usually shave at this point because i look amish and get bugged at work. Ive read all the articles on here and will get some oil. Any tips, tricks, or comments? Any help is welcome! I just want a long full beard. Unsure of i want to style or trim." …
305 2018-07-10 23:18:01 tough one! i think that's where he uses Oil debuff and also Fire attacks.
306 2018-07-10 23:18:00 He sounds like a snake oil salesman! The whole Trump Administration is so corrupt!
307 2018-07-10 23:17:58 I have no idea why Democrats worry about global warming. 
since overpopulation, global cooling, nuclear winter, Three Mile Island, peak oil, the ozone hole, acid rain, mad cow disease, Ebola, AIDS, Y2K, Swine Flu, Reagan, tax cuts, and toxic masculinity killed us decades ago.
308 2018-07-10 23:17:55 Seafoam Deep Creep wins Penetrating Oil Showdown
309 2018-07-10 23:17:52 Oil did this. And conservatives.
310 2018-07-10 23:17:42 Notley's decline in deficit overlays oil price increase...period
No one is buying an NDP word salad with BS dressing.
Got a problem take it up with the future Ex Premier and her Social Worker Finance Minister!

312 2018-07-10 23:17:25 You should do more videos on the economy, regulations, our National debt, Oil, the Fed.
313 2018-07-10 23:17:23 Unless something changes, the plan is for RNH and McDavid to play together and Leon to centre line two. So in other words, you would be correct. In a perfect world, they would play all three on separate lines but that ship left town when they decided to move that guy who wore #4
314 2018-07-10 23:17:18 And here I was thinking trade wars, tariffs, $74 oil and Fed tightening were all bullish...
315 2018-07-10 23:17:04 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Lee
316 2018-07-10 23:16:44 ( OiL ) turn it upside down lol
317 2018-07-10 23:16:26 at least the article is honest that there is yellow, unlike most media reports.
guess i'm sorry to support the dude that has the biggest impact against the oil and ICE industry that we ever had, you know the one that led to wars, and destroys our planet.
318 2018-07-10 23:16:17 Every black family got that one pot with oil sitting on the back burner
319 2018-07-10 23:16:06 I jus drank some hash oil 
320 2018-07-10 23:16:00 So both my younger sisters and their friend have pointed out my stretch marks and called them gross, I’m allergic to bio oil too, shoot me pls :)
321 2018-07-10 23:15:55 Oh definitely. A lot of vegans also eat Oreos and Pringles which are some of the worst for palm oil. Anyway bacon style rashers are gross af.
322 2018-07-10 23:15:51 If that happened there would be no Iran and oil would be $0
323 2018-07-10 23:15:48 He knows when we are sleeping, he knows when we're awake, he knows when we've been bad or good... that's too much blackmail material, only the NSA gets to have that! We WILL melt those poles, win the war on Christmas, and celebrate by drilling for oil in the Arctic!
324 2018-07-10 23:15:24 I wonder if your talks truly helped. Your talks with OPEC didn’t seem to work. Oil at almost $75 a barrel. Where are is the US oil?
325 2018-07-10 23:15:13 ありがとうございます
ちーふさんも連勤で大変ですが、
気をつけて頑張ってください
326 2018-07-10 23:14:57 Man that’s rough. At least you didn’t drop one into a hot frying pan full of oil... (yes, they melt fast!)
327 2018-07-10 23:14:52 Truffle salt is better than truffle oil.
328 2018-07-10 23:14:45 Is that the oil in the #2 of @shanestewart_2
329 2018-07-10 23:14:35 Of course they will. But U.S. producers will produce more oil. Also, Saudi Arabia has agreed to produce more barrels as well. Don’t fret.
330 2018-07-10 23:14:24 Union or not, no company is going to keep an employee around who disparages the business, its partners, and its customers. I’m all for labor organizing, but you’re selling snake oil on this one.
331 2018-07-10 23:14:24 I have been on a Keto diet for the last year. I eat lots of bacon and coconut oil. I feel better than I have in years.
332 2018-07-10 23:14:16 I hope not! Ugh! It’s a hair oil and it wasn’t cheap 
333 2018-07-10 23:13:53 I can't count how many times there's been a clear technical setup and then news comes as the catalyst to play it out. Great example was late May when oil formed a textbook bearish wedge, I was calling for a large drop and then OPEC news came out that they were increasing output
334 2018-07-10 23:13:48 The budget was forecast with $55 oil assumed.  The actual price was LESS for the annual period.  $53.69 average.  $53.69 is not more than $55.  $53.69 is LESS than $55.  Therefore, LESS money came from oil prices.  Not more.  LESS.  55 > 53.69.  Where did I lose you?
335 2018-07-10 23:13:38 My family: it's your turn to make us a healthy dinner
Me, already getting out the vege oil and frying pan: lol

339 2018-07-10 23:13:06 I’m no Socialist, but the comparisons from both the left and right between the US and counties like Norway annoy me.

Norway is not socialist, it is a capitalist country with large oil and weapons exports.

However, it has very high income taxes and a big welfare state =/= 
340 2018-07-10 23:13:01 Remember that guy who forgot to oil his ground harness?
341 2018-07-10 23:12:50 biore cleanse oil + fw himalaya neem 
kalo lg ga make up, micelar water garnier biru + fw himalaya neem
342 2018-07-10 23:12:47 Right. And OPEC agreed to change oil production to reduce prices. Why would anyone believe a habitual liar like you?
343 2018-07-10 23:12:42 I see that Bio Oil Canada has started a very aggressive marketing campaign. Claiming you can use it for your hair and as a primer or as dew drops for your foundation and I’m like  Is it the same mineral oil based bio oil you people are hyping like this?
344 2018-07-10 23:12:37 DAMNED STRAIGHT ~ HE'S NECK DEEP IN THAT SHIT WITH ALL OF HIS BIG OIL DAPPLE GANGING THEIVES AND LIAR'S ~ BREAKING TREATIES AND POISONING WATER ~ IN EFFECT IT IS MURDER ... A SLOW SUFFERING KIND OF MURDER BY POISONING ... I CALL IT WHAT THE FUCK IT IS ...  RACIST GENOCIDE !!!!
345 2018-07-10 23:12:37 North Sea Oil helps. Scotland has the same, but unfortunately we're stuck in the UK, for a while longer anyway.
346 2018-07-10 23:12:28 Just a speculation. If 200 DMA target is $75-80, it could look something like having $65 avg over 150 days and $100-120 avg over 50 days. So yes, $100 oil is in the cards!
347 2018-07-10 23:12:24 Roughly, 1 c walnuts/pine nuts, 1 c olive oil, 1 c nutritional yeast, pepper, lemon juice ( a lemon’s worth/a big squirt), and approximately 2 c scapes. Food process the lot of it until smooth. It’s a very flexible and can be adjusted as desired.
348 2018-07-10 23:12:24 What attacks? Buying 96% if our oil production and then paying it in cash? Once again, you fall into a populist speech but cannot give any details of the supposed attacks. We have the same speech here used by the Government. They call it 'Economic war'. LOL
349 2018-07-10 23:12:22 Me, too. It helped a lot. 

LOL I was so knotted up, she was toting the gallon jug of BioFreeze around the table. Mixed it with the massage oil to help fend off inflammation. I was so slathered in it that I was freezing & had to turn on the heat in my car.

354 2018-07-10 23:11:36 Hi @sergeant_meow! Becoming B Corp certified is absolutely something we are considering.Our laundry detergents contain a minute amount of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, a plant based surfactant that is derived from palm oil. It is not used as a primary surfactant. (1/2)
355 2018-07-10 23:11:32 She nodded, had she finally gotten through to him?

“Confirmation. This unit houses the personality and memories from my human body. It was my final effort to survive after being murdered by Junko Enoshima. I was once the Ultimate Brainiac, but now. . . I’m not so sure. . .”
356 2018-07-10 23:11:29 Its this just like that time you talk to the Saudi to produce more oil and they AGREED? How is that working out?
357 2018-07-10 23:11:25 Italian sausage, grilled  &  (from the garden!) fresh mozzarella & basil (from the garden!)! Grilled ciabatta with olive oil. #itswhats4dinner #donegrilling #nowimchilling #nightALL 
358 2018-07-10 23:11:18 I wish oil wasnt a fuel chemically.
359 2018-07-10 23:11:13 If I were to read a tweet someday saying you have West Nile Virus and I hadn't told you about Cedarwood oil I could never live with myself. My conscience is clear now! LOL
360 2018-07-10 23:11:01 Taking my 2006 Nissan to the mechanic for oil changes gives me the same amount of anxiety as going to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned . Checkups are necessary but it’s always annoying af and costly when they find something “wrong”  #ihateadulting
361 2018-07-10 23:10:43 9/11 would not have occurred but for oil.

365 2018-07-10 23:10:19 Can we make a Godfather themed Italian food line called Oil Pacino?
366 2018-07-10 23:10:18 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
367 2018-07-10 23:10:12 How the fuck is oil "churned?"
368 2018-07-10 23:10:05 it’s the extra strength neutrogena acne cleanser and oil free moisturizer from the same brand, it keeps my skin mostly clear and it’s affordable sooo
369 2018-07-10 23:10:02 (1/1) Joel 2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
370 2018-07-10 23:10:02 Yeah the toxic food ( veg oil and carb) businesses that literally surround me are a warning sign, sad because they could change menu in 6 months, save lives but no longer addictive product; they would go out of business because too many of them
371 2018-07-10 23:09:41 Baby oil is also less expensive because generic works fine!

373 2018-07-10 23:09:29 I've been making the same oil mixture for years. Last month I started using it on my brows @ night. It's really aiding in growing my tail back out !
374 2018-07-10 23:09:27 I only have cbd oil for dogs. Will that work? We usually put it on some bread for Rip.

381 2018-07-10 23:08:50 I’m one of the few people that would buy a bottle of bio oil every few years, use it religiously for a short while & forget about it. I’m not convinced of it’s “extraordinary” benefits but it is very moisturizing after exfoliating in the shower and for that reason, I’ll buy again
382 2018-07-10 23:08:49 Rosehip oil hair mask for da win
383 2018-07-10 23:08:48 We were the richest country in our continent despite America. Now we are the poorest. I see no correlation there. And if it is America's fault then why do we keep selling them 96% of our oil production!? Because they are the only country who actually pays in cash. Weird, really!?
384 2018-07-10 23:08:48 Another scenario .. if there’s an oil rig disaster in the Niger delta lol...
385 2018-07-10 23:08:39 Is this the same thing as you tweeting that you told Saudi Arabia to release their oil to us??  Don't take credit for something imagined...like NK and no more nuclear threat!!  Trying to boost ur ego before facing American allies you shit all over!!
386 2018-07-10 23:08:26 "Don't be tricked by ""light olive oil"". lt has nothing to do with calories, its a reference to a ""lighter color and less potent taste"""
387 2018-07-10 23:08:23 Somebody asked me if I used essential oils. Are you talking about the oil Chick-Fil-A uses? Then yes, yes I do.
388 2018-07-10 23:08:23 I use the Clinique oil- it’s highly concentrated so I feel like I saw results damn near immediately

391 2018-07-10 23:07:57 So your answer is to use our “Strategic Oil & Gas supplies.” In what crises?
392 2018-07-10 23:07:54 If you find where they’re coming from put peppermint oil around the area it’ll make them go home

402 2018-07-10 23:06:13 Palm oil in west Africa is now notorious, but was introduced as alternative crop to slaves. But on the ground (in proto-Nigeria), palm oil tycoons were laws unto themselves, seizing African lands and conducting private wars ('Africa's Great Civilisations', BBC4).

406 2018-07-10 23:05:42 Sure. Its a warning bro. Haha
407 2018-07-10 23:05:42 Well and a lot of truffle oil isn’t made with truffles.
408 2018-07-10 23:05:27 Sure there is, it’s called big oil.  
409 2018-07-10 23:05:26 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
410 2018-07-10 23:05:26 I have the oil, a brush, like a shampoo for the beard, just no idea how to style. So yeah old fashioned barber would be a good thing to look into thankyou

412 2018-07-10 23:05:20 Scott Pruitt is out, but don't forget: Patrick Wyrick is still a federal judicial nominee. Wyrick, who is 37 years old and on Trump's #SCOTUS shortlist, worked closely with Pruitt when he was Oklahoma AG to help the oil & gas industry advance its extreme anti-environment agenda.
413 2018-07-10 23:05:17 @Budget 
I'm currently in the rental van and can not receive adequate service from ANY of your customer service representatives. The van I picked up yesterday has a change oil service light on. We had to put 5 quarts of oil in the car this morning. It was giving to me bone dry
414 2018-07-10 23:05:05 Ugh. I want to try it but other MCT oil I’ve tried is terrible. So I’m nervous. Ha

416 2018-07-10 23:04:49 Happy OIL day to those who bout it
417 2018-07-10 23:04:37 I left the oil field about a year ago. I wouldn’t say I’m out; I just needed a more flexible schedule for the time being.
418 2018-07-10 23:04:32 Did finland ever produce oil?...
419 2018-07-10 23:04:28 Olive oil with flakes of oregano
420 2018-07-10 23:04:25 In addition to hush orders & prosecutions relating to the Panama papers, Albayrak's leaked emails detailing his oil trade with ISIS are long forgotten by the media. Are they afraid or is it forgotten & forgiven?

426 2018-07-10 23:04:01 .@NASCAR Fact of the Day: A race car generally uses up three times as much motor oil as your passenger car.
427 2018-07-10 23:03:58 My mom just bought CBD oil biscuits for my new hyperactive dog. Bless 
428 2018-07-10 23:03:47 If, like me, you have no idea what the best approach on how to go about taming it/shaping it is, search your area for a ye olde style barbershop that does beards. They'll get you sorted and give you advice on maintenance and upkeep. I do recommend a nice beard oil too!
429 2018-07-10 23:03:44 Put it outside wit a lil bit of oil for like 30mins
430 2018-07-10 23:03:42 Welllllll if you want to get technical, those snacks (and similar) are not completely vegan safe because they contain palm oil that destroys animal and environmental habitats.
431 2018-07-10 23:03:39 3 day periods are where it’s at. I use to bleed for a full 7 days!!! HUGE shoutout to: my menstrual cup, my vegan diet, and evening primrose oil.
432 2018-07-10 23:03:30 With the exception of the very few that still support Maduro, almost every single Venezuelan would welcome such invasion. Sadly, most Americans like yourself are naive enough to believe that Trump is after the oil.
433 2018-07-10 23:03:27 I think it could be possible, my grandparents went foraging for example cause food was rare, e.g. made flour out of beech nuts and oil :) Something you don't do today anymore really.
But yea, I think it'd be primarily not about nature ^^
434 2018-07-10 23:02:50 Will this go down the same path as your announcements for North Korea on nukes, Saudi Arabia on oil and countless other misrepresentations you’ve made on the “deals” you’ve made?  If so, I’ll hold my applause.
435 2018-07-10 23:02:41 Sorry for the delay in replying. After our little chat I was on a chopper home to Aberdeen then a train home. Just done an extra week offshore. 4 our of last 5 weeks on Tartan oil platform. Anyway..... what were you saying about having a job again? ........
436 2018-07-10 23:02:41  I think you will like.The blades do like some oil before n after
437 2018-07-10 23:02:23 Will  China place tariff on US crude oil imports to counteract the new US $200 billion tariff on Chinese products? #TradeWars.

439 2018-07-10 23:01:48 @tao_lin I recommend applying lotion or vegetable oil to the piece that goes btw your toes on flip flops [thong]

442 2018-07-10 23:01:37 I've had 5 back and cervical spine surgeries I have pain all the time, I will not take pain meds. Several people have said CBD oil might help??? Do you have an article on that topic? Do you think it would help? What kind to get??? to many Questions?
443 2018-07-10 23:01:35 Get serious! Notley put out the deficit decline curve that is a dead overlay for oil price increase...pass the bong pal
444 2018-07-10 23:01:32 Oil is up.. everything else goes up Let's see the fed try to control inflation with no bullets left in the magazine!

449 2018-07-10 23:01:16 Price changes for Thursday, July 12th: Heating/stove oils to drop by 1.2 cents a litre. Diesel down 1/10th (no change) and Gasoline to drop by 8/10ths of a cent. Oil mostly steady as last week's oil  inventory up. OPEC said trying to meet market's shortfall of Crude. #nlgasprices
450 2018-07-10 23:01:07 I'll have to try it again. Didn't care for the strong truffle oil (?) taste a couple of years ago. Hope that is gone.

452 2018-07-10 23:01:07 Is this like when you called OPEC and told them to lower oil prices? And the saudis said there was never a phone call? Not everyone buys your lies.

456 2018-07-10 23:00:24 Typical populist speech. The attack comes from the Government, not from other Countries. Venezuela sells 96% of the oil to America and yet the Government says it is America's fault that were are poor. Excuse me if I laugh to loud.
457 2018-07-10 23:00:20 You’re like a human oil slick.
458 2018-07-10 23:00:11 Judge had to recuse himself: Save Domestic Oil, Inc. v. United States, 26 Ct. Int’l Trade 371 (2002). Only other casealso didn't go well for the judge -- it was reversed: Appeal of the SEC, 226 F.2d 501 (6th Cir. 1955).

461 2018-07-10 22:59:47 Why is "oil rigs" interpreted as an Insult... lol
462 2018-07-10 22:59:46 Ya know I finally see why some folks get mad when they follow some bloggers’ recipes & the food doesn’t turn out right. I’m sitting here using a blogger’s recipe & she wants you to add hot a** oil and chocolate to eggs w/o tempering the eggs! That’s a disaster waiting to happen!

464 2018-07-10 22:59:24 The Steele Dossier, compiled by the longtime MI6 Russia section chief considered so reliable and knowledgeable he was consistently contracted by US intelligence services, states that Putin offered Trump (via bagman Carter Page) 19% of the giant Russian oil company Rosneft.

466 2018-07-10 22:59:21 Canada has been riding on the coattails of other countries since I was a kid.  If US decides America first we’ve brought upon ourselves the inability to protect ourselves.  We need to revisit how we spend our money. Using Canadian sourced oil across Canada can pay for Defense exp
467 2018-07-10 22:59:11 Factor car maintenance into that as well, you’d be racking up on mileage and spending more on oil changes, tune-ups, and on top of that spending more if things go wrong with your car. Three dollars may very well go directly into these costs

469 2018-07-10 22:58:48 which you have to get a re-fill every 2-3 weeks. I couldn't go get my re-fill because my dog was sick and I had car issues, so I removed them with coconut oil bc they were like half gone and looked so bad. My regular eyelashes are SO SHORT. I have to order some castor oil & serum
470 2018-07-10 22:58:37 Oil changed and car washed. Ready to cause mayhem this weekend 
471 2018-07-10 22:58:33 I sense a little momentum folks. They're now resorting to blocking then answer straight up questions. Shame really

475 2018-07-10 22:58:08 What is your age? 30? If no - it's normal ass. If that ass is 30+ years old - not bad, but still meat have nothing to do with skin health, it's polyunsaturated oils that makes you age especially skin. Butter and coconut oil should be the only oils people use.
476 2018-07-10 22:58:04 
477 2018-07-10 22:57:45 Remember fracking kept the price of oil down? So OPEC tried to figure out how to get rid of Frackers?

480 2018-07-10 22:57:35 Too many are paying high rates plus attempting to meet high deductible. 
Paying a lower rate and paying out of pocket, as they are now to meet deductible would save money.

488 2018-07-10 22:56:53 Is this like the reduced oil price agreement ? You know, the one no one had agreed to but you said they did...
489 2018-07-10 22:56:40 A few days after Bacolod, Mariana and I were so scared because we had this sharp pain around our upper back-neck-shoulder area. We were scared it would be heart attack or stroke. It was probably all the chicken oil. We old. :( and super unhealthy :(
490 2018-07-10 22:56:35 #auspol I assume our pollies have major shares in Caltex/BP/etc judging by the rip off on fuel prices. Oil is 50% of it's highest price ever yet bowser price has surpassed any previous high.

494 2018-07-10 22:56:00 They may already be doing so.  The highest oil prices are making Putin much richer
495 2018-07-10 22:55:59 Yeah lets wait and see - sort of like telling the Saudies to produce more oil so you can produce more bullshit

504 2018-07-10 22:55:16 Interest rats have a conflicting effect on oil, but I don't know about gas.
Oil generally does well while rates are rising but there are many, many 2nd order effects at play.

it’s a natural moisturiser so simply massage it the oil on your stretch marks. If you warm it a bit it improves  blood circulation:)

512 2018-07-10 22:54:30 Did you get a tax refund? Oh wait, do U have a job? POTUS doesn't control OPEC today anymore than Nixon, Ford or Jimmy Carter did. Oct. 1973 price of oil went from $3 a barrel to $12 a barrel (400% increase) in 6 months. Welcome to Planet Earth

526 2018-07-10 22:52:30 Thousands upon thousands who are in the # Keto lifestyle would totally disagree with number 1 and with coconut oil. Many doctors included. Study’s seem to show those on Keto are quite healthy with god lab numbers.

531 2018-07-10 22:51:35 @finebaum It is called "Chicken Fried Steak" because it is fried in oil with a breading (flour etc.) on it much like fried chicken is fried. Without the breading it would simply be fried steak.
532 2018-07-10 22:51:34 Great ideas on how to rid yard of ticks with opossums! Another non-toxic way to rid yard of fleas is a product called "Wondercide". It's made with non-toxic cedar oil, but kills ticks, fleas, and other human pests. Won't kill bees or butterflies! Works!
533 2018-07-10 22:51:31 Apricot oil by itself makes my hair look 10x better than it does with products. Crazy.
534 2018-07-10 22:51:25 It's unfortunate that oil was not discovered during the colonial days. If the Brits had discovered and managed our oil resources for just 5yrs, Nigeria would be better than London.

536 2018-07-10 22:51:08 Wow what a stupid twit, nothing new it's from american. FYI animals is fed antibiotics, antibiotics is proteins, so heat makes them ineffective (almost), you saying to eat poison cooked with poison oil (all seed oils is VERY unhealthy when cooked).Except butter and cocunut oil.
537 2018-07-10 22:51:00 I use these and they’re like glue. Baby oil will get it off though!

540 2018-07-10 22:50:46 Shi tilted her head, makes sense that the Ultimate Mechanic would be so interested in her. . .

“Response. My name is Shi. . . Former Ultimate Brainiac. From what I can remember, Junko Enoshima killed me, not too long ago.”

Shi. . . Is subconsciously talking like a robot, too.
541 2018-07-10 22:50:44 More BS. Just like when u spoke with Saudi re oil price reductions that have not happened. You should sell Vaseline to ur followers to make it easier for all of u.
542 2018-07-10 22:50:40 Subsidizing keeps costs down. Capitalism is supply and demand. If the US didn't subsidize big oil with $4.5-billion a year, they'd make up that $4.5-billion by raising prices higher. They'll get their money. I'd rather see Gov subsidize oil than Tesla. Who can afford a Tesla?

557 2018-07-10 22:49:13 ah yes, the oil industry's technque of raising prices and then rolling back -some- of the increases to make us all so thankful for only fucking us a little more than before, cool, cool, good talk donny

560 2018-07-10 22:48:44 i will never know any moderation with hair conditioner i literally daisy dollop that shit hoping that its coconut oil and orchid extract will heal my soul
561 2018-07-10 22:48:40 Can't wait for the @duponline oil burners and the real IRA petrol bombers sets. #SectarianLego
562 2018-07-10 22:48:34 Coconut  oil treatments are iffy 
563 2018-07-10 22:48:11 changed out my oil n got shit done today 
564 2018-07-10 22:48:03 Dish oil sounds like a real thing.
565 2018-07-10 22:48:02 No, because they don’t play well together. Like water and oil. Fused oil.
566 2018-07-10 22:47:59 Because when the chief executive says, "NK is no longer a nuclear threat" or Saudi agrees to produce more oil," or "Pfizer lowers prices" he should be certain, with wet signatures. When you lie constantly, your every word becomes entirely unbelievable, even when it shouldn't be.
567 2018-07-10 22:47:47 Their stuff is usually too dark and smells like motor oil or something weird
568 2018-07-10 22:47:41 Got out early today and rushed to the dealer to get an oil change #tookmelongenough
569 2018-07-10 22:47:36 Trudeau is such a wass he doesnt care about other people's children going overseas to fight for what?Bush should be charged with war crimes which started this mess.WMD didn't exist.They wanted their oil.
570 2018-07-10 22:47:33 Hit backs are appreciated 

571 2018-07-10 22:47:31 Kinda of like the oil you were getting from Saudi Arabia?
572 2018-07-10 22:47:19 I'm seriously bout stop going to the Wawa's in BelAir and Abingdon. WHY IS EXTRA OIL AND VINEGAR SUCH A HARD CONCEPT
573 2018-07-10 22:47:15 3. No facts, only baseless statements.
4. It doesn't matter where the money's from, only what it's used for. USA has lots of money. When the oil runs out decades from now Norway will have a 'safety' fund of trillions of $ thanks to a government caring about its people's future.
574 2018-07-10 22:47:11 una base turca en el pais sirve para que? llevarse el oro? me gustaria turistiar en estambul a precio solidario socialcomunista a ver ministro de turismo ahora que vamos hacer.

576 2018-07-10 22:47:08 Tea tree oil Burns and makes my skin peel 
577 2018-07-10 22:46:57 My hair is so dry it feels like a fuller brush w/o oil. and it frizzes!
578 2018-07-10 22:46:46 Is this like when you talked to Saudi Arabia about the price of oil and said they agreed to lower it??  Yeah, that was another lie.  Words are nothing without results.
579 2018-07-10 22:46:39 In 1971-2011!

Clearly the union is bad for Scotland 
Labour council all these years too

And these were the best oil years too

Scotland needs self determination

580 2018-07-10 22:46:32 Remember when he asked the Saudis to increase oil production and when he asked Kim to denuke? Lol!
581 2018-07-10 22:46:31 He’s a nasty, old, mean spirited, snake oil salesman.
582 2018-07-10 22:46:30 I'm doin it, I just hate the slimy feeling. I get someone else to oil my head.
583 2018-07-10 22:46:29 i cant wait til the next time i need my oil changed bc the guy that works at valvoline is Too Spicy
584 2018-07-10 22:46:28 I had to put oil in my hair becuz I'm balding in one spot. But I hate hate HATE when my hair feels like grease
585 2018-07-10 22:46:22 I got an oil change and did a face mask, I guess you can say I’ve been productive
586 2018-07-10 22:46:17 So sick of ppl in Ga telling me that they're getting high off CBD Oil.
587 2018-07-10 22:46:17 Should investors in US oil producers be concerned about trade war with China?
588 2018-07-10 22:46:16 she was a trusty ol gal. She loved your oil change & even the fact that YOU started ripping the pink off 
589 2018-07-10 22:46:09 Clear glue. Should we switch to baby oil?
590 2018-07-10 22:46:06 Add dried turmeric. Whitens teeth. I thought it would stain my teeth but it didn’t. Mix with coconut oil
591 2018-07-10 22:46:04 1 of 2 With eyes on him, he couldn’t move the sanctions. As a concession they conspired to manipulate the oil market using the Iran agreement as a pretext to take their oil out of the mix and move Putin in to serve European customers of Iran.  Russia and Saudi economies unstuck.
592 2018-07-10 22:46:01 Already purchased. Lavender oil too. Works wonders on burns. And Grandmothers... X
593 2018-07-10 22:46:00 The wool dryer balls are worth their weight in gold, FYI. I hate all that Young Living Essential Oil nonsense but if you buy a “cheapish” bottle of lavender oil for the wool balls they make your clothes smell more natural, kinda like heaven. Honest to God.
594 2018-07-10 22:45:55 I haven't bought gas at a CITGO gas station in many years, and I'm now adding #Chevron and Valero @ValeroEnergy to that boycott because they continue to buy oil from Venezuela's oil company PDVSA run by narcoterrorists.

600 2018-07-10 22:45:19 If regulations enacted by Obama or anyone else are beneficial to Americans and the environment (long or short term) then why undo them? Why not improve upon them and take the credit? tRUMP’S motivation seems to be providing business buddies with new profits from oil & coal! SAD!

602 2018-07-10 22:45:13 It's been interesting listening to the talk both Pro/Con on $fat $frrsf  My take on this play is that #lithium #batteries are the future and that the #oil is a dinosaur. But when I put my money in it was an amount that I was comfortable with losing it all. Invest wisely

617 2018-07-10 22:43:03 Also protip for eye makeup (and full face makeup) remover: I use Trader Joe’s coconut oil. Makeup is always at least oil-soluble, coconut oil is stable at room temp, and it makes makeup glide off your face. Easy, cheap, natural, effective!

619 2018-07-10 22:42:48 Isreal has always been and always will be a hand in the U.S. economic trade when it comes to oil.  Isreal has always played the middle man in key strategies in the middle east for the U.S. Im not saying Isreal is evil but economist knows its role.

622 2018-07-10 22:42:27 Instead of going to all the trouble of extracting and processing oil (data-mining), find ways of meeting your needs (providing features and UX) that are lower-impact.

Hmm, there's a decentralization / solar panels analogy here too. Do smaller amounts of work across more nodes.
623 2018-07-10 22:42:22 I believe it’s domestic violence
624 2018-07-10 22:42:10 Is this the same as when to talk saudi arabia into producing 2 million more barrels of oil last week you say alot we see very little
625 2018-07-10 22:41:53 Oil works better...So I'm told 
626 2018-07-10 22:41:48 This chilli oil I made gets spicer by the day 
627 2018-07-10 22:41:47 Dear soon to be ex POTUS is this like when you told the Saudi‘s to raise their oil production. LOL. Just keep lying. You can fool 35% of the people all of the time. And that’s enough.
628 2018-07-10 22:41:45 oh that was just because of the hunting and snake oil stuff. There's a part of that game where there is a guy in town selling snake oil.
629 2018-07-10 22:41:20 Vote Democrat in 2020 only if you're sure you want:

647 2018-07-10 22:38:53 3. If we can trust climate scientists, why can't we trust agricultural scientists? Why is it that climate scientists can avoid the allure of big oil money, but ag scientists are somehow easily persuaded by big ag. Easily persuaded, and somehow easily silenced. I just don't buy it

652 2018-07-10 22:38:18 Good convo. But I gotta get offline. 

Convince apple, Google, twitter, the big banks, big oil and big pharmacy, and politicians to live middle class... then I will jump on the socialist ideology train.  Oh yeah, ask prince Harry to give up his fortune too... and Soros!  See???

674 2018-07-10 22:35:02 They're v easy! You'll want to set up a fryer sitch, (a lot of oil in a pan on high heat). Cut up corn tortillas into quarters  and throw into fryer. Let them cook. They're done when they gain some color (~few mins.). Dry them on a plate w/ paper towels. Salt while warm.

690 2018-07-10 22:32:03 Random tax fact #6
In Ancient Egypt, cooking oil was taxed, and on top of that, people had to buy their taxed cooking oil from the Pharaoh’s monopoly, and were prohibited from reusing previously purchased oil.
691 2018-07-10 22:32:00 PSA...you can get the Nongshim spicy ramen from Amazon as well.  When I go to our Asian market I usually get mochi ice cream, good sesame oil, kimchi, Botan rice candy was a favorite when my kids were younger, and I can get veggies like bean sprouts and spinach in larger packages
692 2018-07-10 22:31:54 You could try tea tree oil....it works for so many things.
693 2018-07-10 22:31:41 Today someone at work said "don't get me involved in your termite oil" instead of turmoil. Normally I would assume it to be a joke but with this guy, I dunno. Either way it hurts my brain.

697 2018-07-10 22:31:17 @realDonaldTrump - Sanctions can cause tremendous blowback.   If sales are halted to Iran, it could lead to $120 per barrel oil prices if Saudi Arabia can't keep up the pace.   This could effectively crash the US economy.

703 2018-07-10 22:30:01 Underwater cave rescues happen enough that they train people to do it. If he cares he will keep developing the tech. Kevin Costner spent tons of money developing ocean oil cleanup stuff that they used during the BP spill, he was doing it for years before the disaster
704 2018-07-10 22:29:52 It’s true sometimes your skin starts getting rid of oil and things like that!! It happens to a lot of people when they first go vegan too, similarly. Hang on gal it should pass! X
705 2018-07-10 22:29:49 And I would like to thank Pantene for their amazing oil infused line of hair products & As I Am for their amazing co-wash

707 2018-07-10 22:29:41 Are you using clear glue or baby oil?
708 2018-07-10 22:29:38 awe love, I have oily/ combo skin and this is what works for me 
 clean, (with ur daily face wash)
exfoliate (around 2/3 tms a week) 
then tone ( I use a natural oil but it depends on your skin type)
 moisturize 
and then I set it with aloe Vera water from Mario badescu

712 2018-07-10 22:29:03 Funnily enough, those that idolise the state and think that billionaires are evil can't seem to explain how the state has been incapable of investing in our future. They've been content to control the middle East rather than get us off of oil.

714 2018-07-10 22:29:00 I’ve been at the @BMW dealership for 2 hours waiting for my car’s oil to get changed... I’ve managed to read two full chapters for class so time is well spent 
715 2018-07-10 22:28:56 Just covered my bed and surrounding area in eucalyptus oil in the hopes I can sleep without spiders kicking me out of my room for the third night in a row

724 2018-07-10 22:26:50 Yea. When we were selling oil at $150/barrel, we decided to steal everything and still had to borrow. Infact, one person was mandated to distribute $2.1billion among his party members which was meant to fight BokoHaram. One minister bought houses everywhere. Lol

730 2018-07-10 22:25:41 for sure! just don’t season the meat and bake it so you don’t have to use oil in a pan.

What a terrible reflection on the union that Scotland fared so badly!
Glasgow had a Labour Council all these years 
Clearly the union is not good for Scotland

These were the best years of oil too- taken by WM!!

Under SNP no longer the case!

734 2018-07-10 22:24:53 I see OT as Spiritual or Heavenly events coming down transpiring on Earth. NT Earthly events that must manifest in the Spirit or Heaven.

736 2018-07-10 22:24:42 In a free market oil companies can charge whatever they want. Be thankful gas isn’t $10 a litre, cause I am sure they have thought of it. Otherwise, if there is a necessity someone will step in to fill that void. Might mean smaller more fuel efficient buses. #cdnpoli

748 2018-07-10 22:23:43 all the guys in one of my college snap groups are annoying because all they do is send pics of them juuling so I sent a vid of me breathing in the vapor from my essential oil diffuser and they said "woahhhh sickkk" 
749 2018-07-10 22:23:39 Our ax to grind should be with military and corporate entities, especially big oil. What would make a significant dent is if we all decided to stop driving. Primarily because of the economic impact which would motivate gov’t to invest in green energy #subversiveactions

755 2018-07-10 22:22:22 Fine car nonetheless.

Very expensive running costs on those yokes. Tyres around 400 a corner. Air and oil filters pricey too and it guzzles gas. If i was broke I'd sell it and buy a more sensible car.

Then again, if I was an employer I'd probably pay taxes too.

758 2018-07-10 22:22:10 Suspect it’s mostly due to higher oil prices, which look bullish. Additional export capacity will help heavy/light difs (L3 and TM), & LNG looks like it’s getting a 2nd wind. With macro risks (trade) facing rest of , AB could be Canada’s economic powerhouse. Giddy up!!
759 2018-07-10 22:22:00 I feel bad for everyone in the waiting room. I came to get an oil change after I took off my compression socks  and I'm wearing sandals

771 2018-07-10 22:20:37 This is bs. The Russians could not have prevailed without UK and US help including vital intel, expertise and vast quantities of materiel. Hitler would have taken Moscow & oil fields without UK/US. Game over.

1. Get Trump elected
2. Cut taxes
3. Secure the border
4. Strengthen the U.S. military 
5. Reduce unemployment 
6. Produce more domestic energy oil and gas and make America energy independent.
7. ...wait, how does this plot benefit Russia again?

775 2018-07-10 22:20:03 Two days into cooking camp and the 7yo just explained to me how for a pasta sauce they had to add some
oil before the onions because the pancetta they were using is less fatty than the guanciale you’d typically use. This is the best.

Aloe vera is most likely the most effective home health remedy for stretch marks. Make this mixture combine: 1/4 cup (60ml) of aloe vera gel with the oil of ten vitamin E capsules. Apply once a day until skin has absorbed. 
786 2018-07-10 22:18:43 I use a few essential oils, drink beer and homemade brandy occasionally. I even use oregano oil for antibiotic in most cases of viral infections and turmeric curcumin for pains of all sorts. That’s about it.
787 2018-07-10 22:18:37 Checked the oil in the Terrain today, it’s only been two months since my last oil change. There wasn’t a drop of fucking oil in it. I quit.
788 2018-07-10 22:18:33 What’s crazy is that Canada’s emissions don’t actually include the burning of oil it exports
789 2018-07-10 22:18:23 If you’ve got a turbine blower, they actually work well at low throttle. Just have to make sure something is under the hitch to keep oil from pooling and overheating.
790 2018-07-10 22:18:06 @SenJohnThune Kremlin used your visit to present how pathetically eager are Republicans to kiss Putin’s ass! There is nothing positive from these meeting but simply opportunistic greed for oil share!!

 Gear oil (90wt) is a close second though.
797 2018-07-10 22:17:13 Global inventory data much harder to collect / unreliable. Also US has a lot of oil storage and shipping infrastructure so a lot of global oil flows go through US
798 2018-07-10 22:17:10 It’s obvious energy companies are colluding with the media to try and destroy Elon Musk’s reputation and his companies. Imagine a guy who actually wants to help the world, yet figured out a way to make money doing it. Oil companies aren’t too happy about it

843 2018-07-10 22:09:33 On June 30, the President tweeted that he spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia, who agreed to significantly increase oil production. That should help bring prices down.
844 2018-07-10 22:09:21 Tomorrow I'm attending a 2nd meeting in Kent. Last time I was there I found a beautiful but small oil painting of roses in a little vintage shop. I couldnt justify the spend last month but can this month. I wonder if the fates have favoured me & the painting shall be mine?!

847 2018-07-10 22:08:48 My snack today is celery. With avocado oil dressing. This is what my life has come to

849 2018-07-10 22:08:19 Now backing an entire welfare state on oil...is not the most sound idea. Most socialists are critical of Chavez and especially Maduro.
850 2018-07-10 22:08:14 Bought the @KORAORGANICS Noni face oil I better look like Miranda Kerr in 5-7 days
851 2018-07-10 22:08:07 Y’all really let twitter convince you that coconut oil is bad for you. That’s crazy.
852 2018-07-10 22:07:35 It's literally tied to oil prices. Its that simple.
853 2018-07-10 22:07:29 I was today years old when I realized that 7-10 is so big for dabs because it’s “oil” upside down
854 2018-07-10 22:07:28 Again, sell that snake oil to someone else! The NFL was popular and rising before their phony super patriot scam in which made the American taxpayers cover the expenses for. It was closest to a gladiator sport that’s where it’s popular was derived. That bs patriotism was to
855 2018-07-10 22:06:56 I’m so blessed to have the mom I do. We’re really having an open conversation about mental health, CBD oil, therapy and things to do to make myself honestly happy. The compassion in this woman is incredible. God, I don’t deserve her

857 2018-07-10 22:06:45 It also bothers me that people are more skeptical toward actual scientists than they are toward those failed engineers lying for right-wing paychecks.
Listen to the scientists, please, not the propagandists paid by the oil lobby.
858 2018-07-10 22:06:44 Performance Plus Oil...sting like a bumblebee in that Black and Yellow #6!!! 
859 2018-07-10 22:06:44 A) not all Oilsands are strip mined (actually a small percentage).
B) mines can and are reclaimed.
C)tailing ponds are constantly researching better ways. Most of this research stems from oil sands.
D) US also strip mines and also has tailing ponds (this isnt unique to Ft.Mac)
860 2018-07-10 22:06:43 Yep....money is no object to these oil tycoons...the faster we get done the more they make...OT is no problem either

863 2018-07-10 22:06:36 That oil spill that happened bc of that train derailment has people crazy. “You see why pipelines are better?” Becky, no. Just goes to show that we need better access to renewable energy, like wind, hydro, tidal, etc.

871 2018-07-10 22:05:34 I have a tube of... nyx, maybe? Which is what looked appealing at the drug store when I went looking, and a bottle of nutragena oil cleanser that seems to work ok :)

875 2018-07-10 22:04:41 As are we all. Certainly leaves a lot of ambiguity. Unfortunately in this day and age, to compete at levels Milan have previously enjoyed, it requires outrageous capital from a magnate/group usually involved in oil or backed by oil states.

877 2018-07-10 22:04:23 If seals were culled and salmon aided the southern-resident orca population would rebound; the situation has very little if anything to do with oil tankers - that's a deceit propounded by political activists with ulterior motives.

891 2018-07-10 22:03:12 Ooooo baby oil 
892 2018-07-10 22:03:05 I totally agree. The mid 70's 80's was a fiasco because they were dealing with post peak oil, safety and tech integration. The growing pains lasted through the 90s. Today's cars are reliable, safe, better in a lot of ways, but lacks much of the artistic creativity of 60s & 70s
893 2018-07-10 22:03:03 Me: I’m here for an oil change
Worker: Okay cool
Me: Also please don’t move my car seat I can’t be sure the electric will work to move it back into place 
Worker: Uhhh
Me: I’m very short I’m so sorry
894 2018-07-10 22:03:00 I tend to use enough other stuff that I need a remover anyway and I like actual oil-oil not an "oil cleanser" myself, but it *is* annoying. Burt's Bees orange eessence facial cleanser is a reasonable compromise (emulsified oil in a glyceriney base) but it makes my eyes sting.
895 2018-07-10 22:02:56 Special interests and lobbyists that fund the hypocrites’ big businesses- gas/oil, defense contractors. Google some of our leaders and see what corporations they are affiliated to. We are an effing mess! Help!
896 2018-07-10 22:02:44 Heat up your nails, scoop a huge dab& say Happy 710! (710 is OIL upside down). It's a holiday similar to 420 except it's for us who like to dab. I got 3gz, when I log in tonight we're gonna put take a dab on the tip menu. Let's get baked! #710Day #STONERS #chaturbatemodel

900 2018-07-10 22:01:55 Just got my oil changed and the gentleman opened and closed my door for me. Just proves that there are still a hand full of good people out there!
901 2018-07-10 22:01:54 @MonroMB my man had his car at Monro got an oil change and now his car is in the shop with an engine that seized because all his oil leaked out due to the cap not being on properly!
902 2018-07-10 22:01:40 Me: You’re just getting your oil changed it’s fine.
My anxiety: Drive around in circles and don’t ask anyone because if you do they’ll just think you’re dumb.
Me: *Leaves*

909 2018-07-10 22:00:29 I was once in the queue in Sainsbury's behind someone who had a trolley in which there were 16 four-pint milk cartons and a large bottle of olive oil. It was hard not to wonder about what they might be planning to do with this. I got as far as 'bathing?'.

912 2018-07-10 22:00:09 I’ve been vaping CBD for a week and I can already say it’s better than taking it sublingually! Vaping truly gets rid of some of aches and pains a lot faster than the oil.
913 2018-07-10 22:00:06 Roseneft, the multi-billion dollar oil company, is a large factor in Russia’s interference in our presidential election. They need the sanctions lifted so the oligarchs can access the billions of dollars of oil. They need sanctions lifted.
914 2018-07-10 22:00:03 Never thought i'd miss the oil mill until I got sent over here
915 2018-07-10 21:59:58 He's not unintelligent so...  to me, it's really about what percent is lazy, unsourced pontificating, and what is deliberate snake oil sales to supplement the income of a disgraced career?

919 2018-07-10 21:59:16 Not sure who this was meant for. But I’m a huge supporter of Malaysian Palm oil which is both sustainable and harms no habitat. I’m not  anti Palm at all!
920 2018-07-10 21:58:58 Touché but I have my reasons- last time I used real name, got in a debate online with an anti oil protester while I worked for energy major - they complained to co. I worked for, was let go - bad PR for cowardly pandering co. I was sticking up for & industry we were in I guess
921 2018-07-10 21:58:45 I really like the third theory. I'm imagining some amphipathic molecule, typically monomeric in 100% oil, that is forming micelles in the emulsion that are like super-concentrated bitterness bubbles with the bitter moiety exposed on the surface
922 2018-07-10 21:58:44 Unexecuted contract yet money paid in full, unwarranted waivers on personal and business imports, free parking and airspace usage by private jets owners, hmmm Oil Prospective License and Oil field for ever and d communities are suffering, unremitted revenues, custom's revenue
923 2018-07-10 21:58:43 Rosehip seed oil and niacinamide combo are my favs ! 
924 2018-07-10 21:58:40 2% “finder’s fee” for just the Russia/Exxon oil deal is $10-20 BILLION ... You bet it’s a done deal.
925 2018-07-10 21:58:26 Not eating before going to get my oil change was a bad idea, I’m so hangry rn fml
926 2018-07-10 21:58:04 Ok I bought some organic coconut oil I hope it clean my skin
927 2018-07-10 21:58:04 Good luck to you. Include the fact that 3D mapping helped rescue 13 people in Thailand. That would not have been possible without oil and gas.
928 2018-07-10 21:58:02 Fair enough.
929 2018-07-10 21:57:31 I finished the last couple dabs of this cotton mouth oil, not a whole lot of flavor but lots of , and then we just had some very terpy northern lights thay tasts so minty it taste like some legit GS cookies... maybe thats the genetic lineage
930 2018-07-10 21:57:29 Did you not read article about multiple NASA scientists who stated their models were false, used improper data & or intentionally falsified?
No one is pure here...oil companies capitalist greed would of perfected renewable energy if that effective easy
931 2018-07-10 21:57:27 I spent about 500 hours in the South China Sea (diving in 5m to 70m depths) over a period of 8 years....the best sea life was in shipwrecks and sunken and operating oil platforms.
932 2018-07-10 21:57:22 Try using tanning oil with spf when you go swimming

I got one of those on my wrist years ago in college from and oil splash.
934 2018-07-10 21:57:17 Sometimes ya gotta hold on to the little successes like getting your oil changed, taking out the recycles, and having real food in the apartment for the first time in several weeks.
935 2018-07-10 21:57:10 Win Nov canola down A$2.62/t. EU rape up A$2.15. Palm oil prices at 2 yr low as stocks lift. French rapeseed crop reduced to lowest since 2013, supporting rape futures. Soybns close to unchanged.
936 2018-07-10 21:57:10 Just sautéed spinach using olive oil, immediate thought of James lol
937 2018-07-10 21:57:10 The way the calling on my life Is setup; I can’t be connected to just any and everybody. Therefore, I constantly ask god to add or remove people where he sees fit, because the oil on my life is to powerful to become polluted by the mess that other people are attached too.
938 2018-07-10 21:57:09 Have a feeling it will be next Tuesday. 

Between this and oil reserves down, it's going to get brutal
939 2018-07-10 21:56:55 We are currently looking for ARAB INVESTORS  that would like to invest into our oil & gas sector here in Africa, if you are interested you can chat me asap. i bet you , you will like the offer and profit
940 2018-07-10 21:56:54 Idk how people use coconut oil for everything. I just put it in my hair and I wanna throw up.
941 2018-07-10 21:56:49 And most of that is from pushing Scottish oil, gas, Salmon, beef, confectionary,Whisky, vegetables, venison, langostines through English Ports and Heathrow.

943 2018-07-10 21:56:08 learn about the framework of the EU, it can't just change it to suit you its all enshrined in laws treaties, the arse as fallen out of the oil market, oil is cheap, fracking rife, Scotland out of the UK EU would be forced to sell it on the cheap, like junkies with stolen goods
944 2018-07-10 21:56:04 Sitting out in this heat getting the oil changed on the Jeep. Thankfully I keep a church fan in the car!!!!

949 2018-07-10 21:55:31 We are the only country in the world who hasn't signed on to the Paris Accord.

We also recently had an OIL CEO as a secretary of state recently.

I need you to start doing some math here.
950 2018-07-10 21:55:30 i’m going to be productive today and clean my house, try to go to the store tonight to get coconut oil then do a nice face mask and bath tonight (•̀ᴗ•)و

952 2018-07-10 21:54:41 have you noticed smaller pores/ less oil build up when wearing makeup?
953 2018-07-10 21:54:40 Since it has been a week since I last posted an album review. Tonight's review will be Sophie 'Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides' which I thought was a decent album 6/10 for me.
954 2018-07-10 21:54:36 Plus most contain palm oil- a no no for me.
955 2018-07-10 21:53:50 carrying crude oil smashed the boat to pieces ! No survivors next day I had to scoop those dead women and children out of the water put them in body bags and freeze them take them to Somalia! That's what's been plaguing me every night for years since 2014 I started suffering with
956 2018-07-10 21:53:48 I agree Murkowski sold the Alaskan lands to mining and oil drilling to get her votes and collins sold a vote for a promise for better health care that still hastn't materialized...they've helped alittle but can't be relied on for a fight against GOP...they are still the GOP!!
957 2018-07-10 21:53:41 since #BPDeepwaterHorrizon oil disaster We have had #jellyfish most days in swim areas of #MiamiBeach -Urgent need4 more turtles
958 2018-07-10 21:53:34 Update on my health! The lump from my injection site IS oil buildup and also totally normal. My doctor laughed her ass off at my creative use of vibrator tho.
959 2018-07-10 21:53:33 Starts with Joe Koch's Russian oil empire and ends with Americans unwittingly electing the John Birch Society as the new party replacing Democrats and Republicans.
960 2018-07-10 21:53:30 The #WalkAway "movement" is totally fake. Nothing but Russian bots and trolls.

We can have oil and gas without giving it away for free like Pearce wants to do. We need politicians who will protect New Mexico's resources and make smart deals on our behalf.
961 2018-07-10 21:53:28 A certain family member seems to be more concerned about me consuming too much tuna in sunflower oil than too much alcohol  #itrunsinthefamily
962 2018-07-10 21:52:59 I’ve been told so many things over the years.. usually a coffee, peppermint oil applied to the temples, or yoga specifically for headaches helped. Or a hot shower and put peppermint oil in your conditioner!
963 2018-07-10 21:52:35 An example of humor at inappropriate times: 

Last night an old man hit us and totaled my mom’s car. Karen was clearly sad that her car was wrecked and needed consolation. My dad looked at the damages, shook his head and said, “and the worst part is I just changed the oil.”
964 2018-07-10 21:52:34 Performance Plus Oil, black and yellow!
965 2018-07-10 21:52:12 Obama took us from low employment and high gas prices and made everything much better. The graphs all show him bringing us out of the dumpster. Trump is climbing,then diving.His trade decisions will kill us. His oil decisions r 2 get Russia sanctions dropped & buy from them.
966 2018-07-10 21:52:11 Oh yes. I even bought clove oil but that just distracts you with the burning rancid taste.
967 2018-07-10 21:51:43 Trouble is when do you sell, first the Portland then the Kim layers. One of them did over 900 barrels of oil a day. Imagine one RNS after another over a fairly short period of time. mind boggles. Viva. 10p will be my minimum .Can't wait! :)
968 2018-07-10 21:51:42 Just returned from Motherland. Good call on Flo...get the gelato and lots of it. Tuscan olive oil is also amazing. 
Get the Mrs a leather handbag and you a belt. Good stuff.

970 2018-07-10 21:51:10 Girlll bomb! I only use is when I’m applying makeup tho. NO oil. Other than that I use rose water spray
971 2018-07-10 21:51:10 Ok but I just don't see how we can hold the factory farming/ oil companies accountable for their actions if we aren't prepared to change the way we eat/ get around. How can we claim to be victims if there are other options out there?
972 2018-07-10 21:51:07 I use tea tree oil and lavender oil about 3 drops of each all over a clean face. It’s worked wonders for me!
973 2018-07-10 21:51:04 "I mean.. Well he's the one who hired me!!"
974 2018-07-10 21:50:33 It’s not the beard it’s that some of these guys can’t change the oil in the car or even put IKEA together
975 2018-07-10 21:50:30 I feel fugly cause I took my nails off yesterday and I’m debating to do them today or wait til tomorrow after I change my oil so I do not fuck them up
976 2018-07-10 21:50:24 It's causing chaos with my coconut oil though!
977 2018-07-10 21:50:22 I'm so annoyed by that plastic ass club. Literal nobodies until oil money started buying them trophies. Fake ass, gits.
978 2018-07-10 21:50:18 i need to learn how to change my oil m, i hate bothering/asking ppl to do it 
979 2018-07-10 21:50:18 リノア(CV花澤香菜)でひっくり返ってる
980 2018-07-10 21:50:13 Try baby oil mixed with Dettol.
981 2018-07-10 21:50:12 Yeah, vegetable oil seems to last much longer than olive oil and I use less.
982 2018-07-10 21:50:06 It's a super complicated issue but bringing oil through the mountains on train cars isn't working well either :(
983 2018-07-10 21:49:59 Ladies. Did you know you can mix equal parts coco powder and coconut oil to make TANNING LOTION?? That lasts through a SHOWER?? Because I didn’t until now. It looks like Jergens but it smells like chocolate. I feel like a secret was being kept from me. I am so mad.
984 2018-07-10 21:49:55 You need to understand, its not 2014, the EU & UK are not allies they are competitors, Scotland's the 12th largest economy in EU, the largest oil producer, the EU wont pass up a chance to improve its situation at the expense of a competitor, the world doesn't work like that.
985 2018-07-10 21:49:52 I'm the kind of guy that'll change his own oil to save $7 but buy a $500 phone and take it canoeing and drop it in the river
986 2018-07-10 21:49:48 No he did not....he tweeted that.He can not negotiate with them to pump more oil. Check OPEC laws. Also ...the stock market goes up when rich people buy stocks. When Trump gives them tax breaks they buy stocks.the rest of us stay poor,have crap wages& healthcare.

989 2018-07-10 21:49:16 Do we need to return to when those Who had above average $$ can afford medicine, preventive or otherwise.  Why do you think epidemics were so frequent?  If healthcare is not affordable it 
The days of quacks, snake oil and do it  yourself  edict for those with less $ will return.
990 2018-07-10 21:49:14 The rendering in this is so nice?? It has like a classic oil paint quality
991 2018-07-10 21:49:09 Win Nov canola down A$2.62/t. EU rape up A$2.15. Palm oil prices at 2 yr low as stocks lift. French rapeseed crop reduced to lowest since 2013, supporting rape futures. Soybns close to unchanged.

1001 2018-07-10 21:47:58 My hometown had its second bout of severe storm damage to a man camp since the oil boom and I’m feeling a bit fucked up about it
1002 2018-07-10 21:47:43 Pro tip: throw a little oil on before the gym.
1003 2018-07-10 21:47:39 remember when doctors said smoking was good? and 'science documents' got published. articles got written? we know the verdict of that history, and how much the smoking industry made sure to make their view heard. the oil & ICEcar industries are big and powerful too
1004 2018-07-10 21:47:33 Coconut oil sis
1005 2018-07-10 21:47:23 Oil/coal comes from a pasadisiac period for biodiversity (100 million years ago/Mesozoic),where the magnetosphere was 3x stronger, a warmer Earth without cryosphere and much more CO2 (food plants) and a greener planet.
1006 2018-07-10 21:47:20 nothing is permanent, although electric cars run on solar panel generated electricity seems to last alot longer than oil & gas burnt for energy, and then there are reusable rockets, high speed tunnel transportation, & paypal & artificial intelligence may turn out to be immortal

1009 2018-07-10 21:46:24 FYI - 710 is the stoner term used to describe and celebrate marijuana concentrates, similar to how 420 is used. 710 was chosen because if you turn the number upside down, it spells ‘OIL’ which is a term often used when referring to marijuana concentrates like wax, shatter, etc!
1010 2018-07-10 21:46:18 @oldelpasouk hi do your taco shells have wheat in them? ive searched ingredients online and it just says corn flour and sunflower oil, yet you then say ‘may contain wheat’ so im confused 
i really need tuna and corriander tacos tomorrow! 
1011 2018-07-10 21:46:13 Girl yes  I swear I had foreigns that shit ain’t worth it . A damn oil change be over 100$
1012 2018-07-10 21:46:13 Love getting red oil paint all over my carpet 
1013 2018-07-10 21:46:04 Coconut body oil all summer
1014 2018-07-10 21:45:48 I worked outside in 116 degree weather under a car draining oil. I think I know what hot is. 
1015 2018-07-10 21:45:35 I will drag your coconut oil ass out of bed to grab a beer with us
1016 2018-07-10 21:45:33 I still don't understand how my oil changes are $100+. -_-
1017 2018-07-10 21:45:30 @realDonaldTrump We need less dependance on foreign oil.  Don’t send US troops to the Middle East to keep shipping lanes for oil open.  Open instead the opportunity for consumers to use #ethanol E15.  Save $$ and support our ag economy and clean up our air.
1018 2018-07-10 21:45:26 Oh FFS #Newsnight  not again, your becoming the new #r4today . iGNORE the snake oil twats, please.
1019 2018-07-10 21:45:25 Rosemary and olive oil veggie straws taste EXACTLY the same as regular veggie straws what kind of a world do we live in
1020 2018-07-10 21:45:21 Is it normal to pay $70 for an oil change or did i just get ripped off
1021 2018-07-10 21:45:20 you are incorrect my friend it is egg and oil
1022 2018-07-10 21:45:15 no this bitch didnt just use all my coconut oil to fry chicken.. this bitch did.
1023 2018-07-10 21:45:15 The oil prevents any "grip".  Bribery.
1024 2018-07-10 21:45:09 The state of my coconut oil...

1026 2018-07-10 21:45:01 Thanks! The beads are called Armor Beads — they’re a super useful alternative to oil, if you don’t need very high temperatures for reactions. The company can send you a free amount to test if you contact them!
1027 2018-07-10 21:45:00 High key, she really does look like an oil painting. Wow.

1029 2018-07-10 21:44:55 Goodbye USA. We see us again when your oil prices go through the roof when we do not support your middle east politics anymore. NATO always stood to their allies after 9/11. Good luck with your "war on terror" all alone. Greetings from Germany

1031 2018-07-10 21:44:39 at this point lets just accept it and use Oil instead
1032 2018-07-10 21:44:35 Sorry we have a shed load of low information MPs thicker than crude oil tar and treacle combined, Spwmd a week listening to Ian on LBC and your realise he is thick as shit

1037 2018-07-10 21:44:09 We are making healthy choices. We’re also not going to stop using oil until alternatives become viable
1038 2018-07-10 21:44:00 Have you guys done an audit of all your palm oil products?
1039 2018-07-10 21:43:58 Isn't it because a year or two ago the top surveillance data extracting companies displaced all the top oil extracting ones?
1040 2018-07-10 21:43:56 So what is wrong with the American farmers feeding 30mil of their own people?Why do we eat Mexican & Australian beef,New Zealand lamb,Mexican vegetables?Don't we pay as much as a German would?Why is our newly deregulated oil going overseas while the gasoline price is rising?
1041 2018-07-10 21:43:56 When I was young, and extremely stupid, coconut oil was the sun cream of choice. We knew it was hot when it became a liquid.
1042 2018-07-10 21:43:55 I wanna do Dermaplaning again, it removes so much oil and shit from your face
1043 2018-07-10 21:43:53 ohhh no no if I used coconut oil on my face I 100% would break outtt

1047 2018-07-10 21:43:06 The last round of high oil prices worked at our house. We ended up buying a used hybrid when the car died and saved thousands. When hydro went way up, we finally got the kids to turn off a light once in awhile. Carbon taxes are only a piece of the puzzle but they work.
1048 2018-07-10 21:42:57 I’m going to visit 13 National Parks next year if they aren’t all flaming oil fields
1049 2018-07-10 21:42:55 Totally forgot what the date was! Happy 710  too bad I don’t have any oil to dab at the moment 
1050 2018-07-10 21:42:53 #TeenChoice #ChoiceFandom #BTSARMY @BTS_twt beef marinating recipe according to Seokjin: soy sauce, sugar, green onions, garlic, sesame oil and seeds. Try it it's so good
1051 2018-07-10 21:42:40 Also, I know a lot of people talk about how coconut oil is good for your face, but it acc isn’t. So if you’re using it, try and replace it with the Vaseline Cocount lotion instead of oil because coconut oil is thick and slippery, which may make your make up slide off quicker x

1054 2018-07-10 21:42:18 Keep them in a dark cabinet and bring em out once in a while to clean them, oil them up, and put a few rounds in them.
1055 2018-07-10 21:42:07 I tried Jin's recipe for marinating beef - soy sauce, sugar, green onions, garlic, sesame oil and seeds and it tastes so good <3 @BTS_twt
1056 2018-07-10 21:42:04 @bobkeroll Would you mind sharing your favorite recovery sandwich recipe again? I found one from an interview in Jan., but it’s different. I caught tomato, sourdough and olive oil (toasted) but I missed the type of cheese! Thanks!!
1057 2018-07-10 21:41:43 "Well I do care about someone who's been helping me stay busy through all of this."
1058 2018-07-10 21:41:33 I have so much oil but no torch lmao fuck me
1059 2018-07-10 21:41:21 and North Sea oil although that was a mixed blessing in the end.

1062 2018-07-10 21:41:12 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1063 2018-07-10 21:40:58 I do make oils and balms. My favorite is evergreen oil and balm and another one that is scented with Jasmine. 
1064 2018-07-10 21:40:55 Most Nigerian parents don’t understand the term ‘depression or suicidal thoughts ‘.
They think everything is spiritual or about holy water & anointing oil.

I’m not surprised most people can’t talk to their parents when they are down, they just reach for their friends.
1065 2018-07-10 21:40:47 Air dry cream and Rejuvenique oil for sure!
1066 2018-07-10 21:40:35 CBD Oil and vape pens right down the street....why didn't I have this kind of product access in PA, to help with my insomnia!?

1068 2018-07-10 21:40:30 Rose oil w squalane is dope as hell for a moisturizer too 
The squalane is dangerous tho because depending on the brand they might kill sharks for it :( I think normally it can come from some plants or some shit

1074 2018-07-10 21:40:04 To add oil to a dish already cooking, add it in the edge of the pan. That way, it will be heated when it reaches your food. #VAfitness
1075 2018-07-10 21:40:03 First foreign visit by @realDonaldTrump was to rich Saudis who Intel says FUND extremism #oil
1076 2018-07-10 21:40:02 After the oil crash followed by the election of a government whose policies drive off investment in the non renewable sector, that claim is no longer factual.
1077 2018-07-10 21:40:01 The lava beads can double as an essential oil diffuser! Make sense. But great, two of my impulse purchases corroborate.

1080 2018-07-10 21:39:36 Although very little was achieved because the structure in place then could not support efficient reserves management, enduring lessons could be distilled from the nation’s past experience. Thus, Since the 1970s, Nigerian economy has persistently depended on oil as the mainstay..
1081 2018-07-10 21:39:32 Currently touring U.S. with my family using our Honda Pilot. Had to change oil in Kentucky. Huffman Honda uses Honda Oil while Elk Grove Honda which uses Castrol Oil. My SUV’s performance is better with Honda Oil. It makes driving experience positive; the car feels more powerful.
1082 2018-07-10 21:39:29 Before lying to your followers, you need to first understand that #Kirkuk & its oil facilities are No longer under control of #KRG (#Kurdistan Regional Government), Kirkuk is under control of #Iraq|i government.
1083 2018-07-10 21:39:28 Alaska and all of our oil.

1085 2018-07-10 21:39:02 Yes, if it is made into a salve which has hemp oil also. Liquid CBD oil is best used sub-linguilly. There is even CBD "vape" juice now with no nicotine . But that stuff is really expensive in full strength. I've got CBD chap-stick too.

1092 2018-07-10 21:38:26 Hey that's great advice I'm going to try that for sure but I but the oil is too expensive for me sadly but if I stop buying moose gel and hair spray then maybe I could afford it.
1093 2018-07-10 21:38:25 Happy 710!  Don't forget the oil!
1094 2018-07-10 21:38:23 They know that but really don't care. Oil on East coast comes from Saudi Arabia but they got Quebec to shut down the West-East pipeline because of oil from Alberta. Now will have three exit points out of Alberta and they'll go find something else to protest
1095 2018-07-10 21:38:17 Hahahaha. Apir migo 
1096 2018-07-10 21:38:14 Got my oil changed this morning. When I picked up my car, they told me my engine mounts are all rusting out & they estimate it'll be 6-12 months before my engine falls out 
1097 2018-07-10 21:37:56 If you believe he was preparing that I’ve got some lovely snake oil you’re just going to love.
1098 2018-07-10 21:37:47 I blocked her, I can't take arguing with these ppl any more, they won't listen to the Facts, they just won't let the truth in. I kinda figured by what u wrote exactly what they were saying, it's the standard talking points for these ppl
1099 2018-07-10 21:37:36 More of Paul’s made up lies. Sold much snake oil this week?
1100 2018-07-10 21:37:31 Can everybody stop referring to electric vehicles as being zero emission. This really needs to be addressed. They are ONLY zero emission at point of use. Electricity has to be produced to charge them..be it coal fired, oil , gas or nuclear. They don’t solve problem just shift it.
1101 2018-07-10 21:37:22 3. Norway isn’t a serious country & if bigger countries with actual world power tried to do what they did the global quality of life would fall dramatically. 
4. They’re paying for all this with the money they got from luckily being a country near oil & oil runs out.

1105 2018-07-10 21:37:08 Alaskan residents get a share of the oil wealth from what's pumped.  Its a nice check, I think $1k-$3k per year.
1106 2018-07-10 21:37:04 it does the same job as castor oil, just much better and less distasteful
1107 2018-07-10 21:37:00 You know someone is old as fuck when they say:

“sun-tan lotion/sun-block”

instead of

“sunscreen/tanning oil.”
1108 2018-07-10 21:36:57 #Iraqis should not be morons like the #Kurds & trust the #Americans, they will be duped if they did & they should burn all #Americans & #BritishGP Oil fields in #Iraq, the oil do not belong to Iraqis & that's why they're starving & they have no electricity in over 50 degres temp.
1109 2018-07-10 21:36:52 UK's investment in Azerbaijan is mostly in the Oil sector and western oil companies do business in some of the worst places in the world. Russia has a special status in Armenia, reforms or not, no one is going extort large Russian companies in Armenia. There would be consequences
1110 2018-07-10 21:36:32 2 international holidays in a row starting today! Gets some OIL in today and Slurpees, tomorrow, my friends!

1112 2018-07-10 21:36:08 What  said RT @WillFletchUK: @Pringster78 Prick them all over with a fork, then rub in oil and salt. Put in the oven at 180 for at least 90 minutes, but they can stay in for up to two hours no problem. Gives a nice crispy skin and fluffy interior.
1113 2018-07-10 21:36:04 Oil. You never watched cartoons ?
1114 2018-07-10 21:35:58 I’m replying to the comment above from @RobbynAckner. Read her commentary
1115 2018-07-10 21:35:55 It's a slap in the face to all liberty loving, law abiding ppl generally. The very acts of illegals destroy the foundations of the country, law and freedom they seek. In obtaining desires, they diminish the value.
1116 2018-07-10 21:35:55 For dry skin 
• 1 tbsp aloe bear 
• 1 tbsp fresh cream 
• 1/2 tsp vitamin E oil
1117 2018-07-10 21:35:55 #ToMyFutureSeed: I'll teach you about loyalty. I'll teach you that your skin is black like oil that's for royalty. I'll show you all the things that my pops never got to show me. Treat you like a growin' tree with this poetry. The present is our gift, but your kids have tomorrow.
1118 2018-07-10 21:35:52 Even my coconut oil is all melted indoors. This heat is actually alarming
1119 2018-07-10 21:35:51 Leave in conditioner, Argan Oil & a bit of hair spray.  I only shampoo every other shower. It would be madness if O washed every time!
1120 2018-07-10 21:35:50 Cath you still have to lube that contraption with oil. Terrible for the environment. Ask Trudeau anything regarding oil he’s trying to stop 
1121 2018-07-10 21:35:27 No because there is no "solution". Without oil that can be extracted economically, it's goodbye to "modern" civilization and to all oil derivatives like wind turbines, solar panels and also nuclear power.
1122 2018-07-10 21:35:26 Hey @chevrolet you did it again. You put the high pressure ac port right on top of the engine where is does no good. The service port on my 2012 Traverse is by the oil filter, where the engine is guaranteed to burn you if you want to add refrigerant. Fire your engineers!
1123 2018-07-10 21:35:26 building an economy less reliant on oil would be the best future strategy (I bet smarter people than me have figured that out already)
1124 2018-07-10 21:35:25 Hi im Eddie been 16months sleep better  suffer from a lower abb hernia after the first 3months i forgot i even had it no pain deminish the hernia thanks to cbd oil feel great
1125 2018-07-10 21:35:19 what? when? when he was selling some weird snake oil type supplement or when he yaps about being a creationist...???
1126 2018-07-10 21:35:15 @TheCharlesGross its not grease its skin care, *me covered in cocoa oil for the night time*
1127 2018-07-10 21:35:09 @patmaroon I hope you have a great season with the @StLouisBlues I am sad to see you go. make me proud with your new team. I will cheer for you buddy. Oil country still loves you thanks for all great memories as @EdmontonOilers player #number19forever
1128 2018-07-10 21:34:51 Right after ISrael gives back illegally occupied Golan Heights & its massive oil/gas reserves they stole from Syria. And then give back Occupied Palestine, and Israel gives up its illegally made 300 nukes that ZERO weapon inspectors have been allowed to check ever.
1129 2018-07-10 21:34:48 Oh and sucking dick for a oil change ain’t you are something else 
1130 2018-07-10 21:34:38 Tomorrow they are 'going home'.
1131 2018-07-10 21:34:35 They want to start drilling for oil in the Amazon rain forest  we need to go renewable!
1132 2018-07-10 21:34:29 Coconut oil to the scalp
1133 2018-07-10 21:34:20 Did you see the Wall street Journal article on AI in the Oil industry?

I am Sending a copy to your email!
Love mom
1134 2018-07-10 21:34:13 There's no abandoning Europe. Europe's just fine. No worries should USA pull from NATO. USA will simply act in it own best interests as it always had. That's why USA got involved in 'WWI'/'WWII' - self-interest, mostly mid-East oil. NATO was a Soviet response. No Soviets now.
1135 2018-07-10 21:34:05 Change your car oil on October 1st
1136 2018-07-10 21:33:54 Bought a whole new essential oil set today 
1137 2018-07-10 21:33:49 It really shouldn’t take almost 3 hours for an oil change gat damn!
1138 2018-07-10 21:33:45 i LOVED them they don’t hurt your real lashes ..all your lashes naturally shed out within 4-6 weeks tho that’s why you have to get them filled .. it’s worth it if you’re going to keep up with them .. and if you want to take them off don’t pull them soak them with coconut oil!
1139 2018-07-10 21:33:45 aw!  Thank you so much!  I do really want some focaccia and olive oil now
1140 2018-07-10 21:33:43 Tanning oil.
1141 2018-07-10 21:33:41 You defendet nothing. You make wars for oil and power.
1142 2018-07-10 21:33:35 I would guess putting multi billion dollar oil deal back on track. Putin could use the additional cash in his pockets and Trump needs to repay him for the cash he received over the years and for his current job.
1143 2018-07-10 21:33:19 made a our garlic beef sausage, olive oil and lemon juice, and cheddar sandwich
1144 2018-07-10 21:32:59 Trying to induce with Castor Oil will forever be one topic that pisses me off. Especially at 36-37 weeks, like why?
1145 2018-07-10 21:32:57 Coconut oil. Always
1146 2018-07-10 21:32:40 @dbongino Shifty shut up with the same old inaccurate propaganda. Your taking points are getting old just like you.  Get out of politics and get a job you can do. I have no idea what that would be.  Panhandler or snake oil salesman.  That way you can continue to lie.
1147 2018-07-10 21:32:31 In these replies you will find: racism, imperialism, anti-Africanism, and ignorance. You will find few, if any, replies that understand how European and Israeli arms manufacturers benefit from the war, or about oil exploitation by the West at large. That’s how it goes.
1148 2018-07-10 21:32:30 Mr. Tire always wanna tell me about my damn tires. JUST CHANGE MY OIL SO I CAN GO!
1149 2018-07-10 21:32:18 What a perfect day, too come in and pick up some amazing $10 grams of oil. Honu oils flying off the shelves. Come stock up while you can!!!
1150 2018-07-10 21:32:13 Can you open my coconut oil when you come over!?! 
1151 2018-07-10 21:32:07 Just take a cold slice of a fresh lemon rub lightly on your skin. Rinse. Then take a drop of olive oil and message lightly into skin. Im fifty and have been doing it for 20 years and I have no wrinkles. Twice a day. 3 cents a day and inbetween on a hot or cold day a spritz of h2o
1152 2018-07-10 21:32:00 Oil everywhere
1153 2018-07-10 21:31:58 Well done!
1154 2018-07-10 21:31:53 Believe me, I know my shit. It’s not my fault you don’t believe me when I say that poison ivy is ONLY SPREAD BY THE OIL OF THE PLANT. It’s not spreading because it’s oozing, it’s spreading because you had oil on your hands and touched everywhere.
1155 2018-07-10 21:31:53 I hope this isn't directed towards me, I don't hate All Men, I don't believe everyone who claims abuse by Men, without evidence, I don't ever pit Men vs. Women, as I'm not and never would be a Feminist. I blocked a lot of these Libs, so i'm hoping ur speaking to one of them.
1156 2018-07-10 21:31:43 Today i changed oil on my bmw for the first time. 35,000 km since last oil change 
1157 2018-07-10 21:31:30 Me: whats up man i need a full service oil change

1159 2018-07-10 21:30:32 Trump is withdrawing US from the Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for Russia. the increase that has already happened in oil prices is providing Putin with an extra $520 million a day.

1161 2018-07-10 21:30:26 In typical day before show opens panic I put dish soup on a pan instead of olive oil and proceeded to put my food on top of the soap and cook it for a few seconds before I realized the atrocity I had committed
1162 2018-07-10 21:30:18 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1163 2018-07-10 21:30:14 If that oil is real then that's what up. Pass it here yo
1164 2018-07-10 21:30:04 Lavender essential oil is a natural sedative. It promotes relaxation in your nervous system. At times when you feel stressed or your conf...
1165 2018-07-10 21:30:02 Wow! That’s the icing on the cake! flynn-jr-lobby-oil-qatar you can’t get swampier then that! 
1166 2018-07-10 21:29:57 There’s oil fields near me...
1167 2018-07-10 21:29:51 How to start your holidays properly?:

Timing belt change  
New EGR valve  
Turbo coupling change 
Oil and filter change  

Saying bye to my budget planning.
1168 2018-07-10 21:29:43 You wouldn’t get approval to paint the sails of the Sydney Opera house so why change the oil in your car.  #lylelogic
1169 2018-07-10 21:29:38 #ripitupplaylist Broken Down Angel - Nazareth, NEXT - Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Cod Liver Oil and the Orange Juice - Hamish Imlach, Little Ticks of Time - Matt McGinn, Shoeshine Boy - The Humblebums..... loads more
1170 2018-07-10 21:29:35 I don’t even care about the Vampire vs Werewolves. I just like people that turn into giant murder animals to kill oil executives and shit.
1171 2018-07-10 21:29:12 Got an oil change and the AC fixed in my truck and I’m such a happy camper right now.
1172 2018-07-10 21:28:53 Finally getting my oil changed tomorrow. Maintenance light been on for 2 weeks. I’m sure my car is about to blow up 
1173 2018-07-10 21:28:29 If you add a little coconut oil to the pan...
1174 2018-07-10 21:28:18 Yeah I noticed that after I hit send and he's followed Pillar and his stellar .275 OBP...only guys worth watching at the plate in that group are Granderson, Grichuk and Travis.
1175 2018-07-10 21:28:08 Nigeria is fucking broke. 

Thinking about it is making me pissed. They get the crude oil from my state and leave us worse for it. Sell it. Share the money among themselves. And can't fucking afford to insulate us from the consequences of their actions.
1176 2018-07-10 21:28:01 I'm the total opposite. I use anything with oil that I can put in my hair every day. LoL When I used to go on the beach I put Deep Tan Oil in my hair every day
1177 2018-07-10 21:27:59 Love getting a oil change, my baby be riding so smooth
1178 2018-07-10 21:27:58 Your getting some kind of oil on the chip when I worked fast lube I was 1 every 6 months or so... That and if its bmp they have an issue with them
1179 2018-07-10 21:27:51 I just sucked down a bunch of jalapeño-infused olive oil as if it were some kind of delicious sauce and now I am begging Jesus for death
1180 2018-07-10 21:27:32 Please DM us and we will send you pre canned messages from a robot that drinks motor oil from dead prius'
1181 2018-07-10 21:27:30 take your omega 3 fish oil pills and head off to bed
1182 2018-07-10 21:27:17 Not back to your "land w/o pple for pple w/o land" bs again? 40 Jewish Fam. came from Russia in 1882 to est, Rishon LeZion on Palestinian land bt surely that was long bf 1948 and the State of Israel. Did these guys also shoot up the Natives to steal their Land, Oil, Water etc?
1183 2018-07-10 21:27:12 Oil needs processing before being useful and using it has side effects
1184 2018-07-10 21:27:03 Well oil is changed, gotta clean my car really good and it'll be off to the races after two days of work in Mangum
1185 2018-07-10 21:26:53 Bought lavender oil which stopped any more but the others were already infected. It's only me and only in the evenings- the others are fine. #Juicy
1186 2018-07-10 21:26:49 Back in the day someone like him was referred to as a lounge lizard. His advances were unwanted. Just did what I had to do. My Dad taught me how to throw a ball, change my oil, shoot a gun & kick some ass. Who would've thought 38 years later the jagoff would be in the WH.
1187 2018-07-10 21:26:42 My hair used to be boob length which is what I’d love to get back  I have tons of coconut oil in my cupboard  I shall start to use it
1188 2018-07-10 21:26:36 Next to the whitealroker reference at Fidelity in Dallas was an African American woman from CA with my mother's name. So Fidelity Investments is tied to my Dad's shop with oil and gas, pit traders/traders and politicians.
1189 2018-07-10 21:26:26 Why is it always Women vs Men? Why can’t it just be that “Women are strong”.  I’m sorry you suffered so much as a DV and sex victimn but ALL women are not stronger than ALL men, and vice versa. I think you need to talk with someone about this hate.
1190 2018-07-10 21:26:23 My oil change was 180
1191 2018-07-10 21:26:22 Alberto Sughi, Il grande bar, 2001 Oil on canvas, 130x110cm
1192 2018-07-10 21:26:21 Do you have any oil
1193 2018-07-10 21:26:17 Lol! Dude I’ll make veggies for you sometime. I made bang bang broccoli and Cauliflower. So I put them in a pan with spices, oil, lemon, lime, Sriracha and set the pan on the gril! Mmmm
1194 2018-07-10 21:26:03 Dusted in flour and spices and pan fried in olive oil. #easypeasy
1195 2018-07-10 21:25:59 A Nice sail down #LoughRee today arrive at #CoosanPoint to find the #bowthruster has spit 20lts oil into the bilge and a fresh water leak has put 400lts in to join it! ! #sailingforfun on the #pints now sort it #tomorrowspaperstoday
1196 2018-07-10 21:25:57 @MavisTire Do not go here! Especially the site in #nazarethpa #MavisTire botched an oil change! Emptied my transmission fluid. Double filled the oil
1197 2018-07-10 21:25:46 Use a sterilized needle to keep the hole open, then put coconut oil in it so it wont close until u can put the piercing in again
1198 2018-07-10 21:25:37 7/11/2017 API reports c/g/d -8/-1/+2.  EIA reports -7.5/-1.6/+3 on prod 9.4, crude imp 7.6, exp 0.9, and ref 17.25.  Included a 3.2mb SPR withdrawal & -.376 adj factor. WTI $ rose on API and fell on EIA. Such a different world now. #OOTT #API #EIA #oil
1199 2018-07-10 21:25:35 Everyone’s hair has an end point it won’t grow past, so it’s possible that you’ll never get Daisy hair, however it will be stronger without the bleach. Use coconut oil and biotin hair vitamins 
1200 2018-07-10 21:25:17 Why do barbers ask you do you need a cut when you walk into the shop? Like nigga look at me I’m a walkin hair ball!!! Why else would I be here tho? To get my oil changed
1201 2018-07-10 21:24:50 Ya that’s like Audi’s. My oil changes are over $100
1202 2018-07-10 21:24:33 I guess if you act like a bitch when you’re getting your nails done, they do extra to make them look good. Girl put oil on my hands and everything
1203 2018-07-10 21:24:23 I have compassion for the people who you try to snooker with your snake oil. I have compassion for the people hurt by Peterson's cult. Heck, I eve have compassion for you as a human being. That doesn't mean that I'm not gonna call you out on your pseudo-compassionate baloney.
1204 2018-07-10 21:24:18 Thy have oil
1205 2018-07-10 21:24:09 #mavistire has the worst customer service ever. Botched my oil change. Car overheated. Now chasing them down to get paid back!
1206 2018-07-10 21:24:03 In other words, England needs free oil, electricity & water. Definitely wouldn't last long without either country propping it up
1207 2018-07-10 21:23:57 And he enjoyed it immensely.
1208 2018-07-10 21:23:54 what about truffle oil?
1209 2018-07-10 21:23:52 Mines had some and stuff but they were light and now I’m getting dark ones I about had a heart attack. Use bio oil and shea butter mixed
1210 2018-07-10 21:23:52 Try taking fish oil capsules. Take 2 or 3 for a couple days then increase taking 4 for a couple days, 6, 8, 10... easy and natural way to help with cat allergies. My friend did this and got rid of their allergy completely.
1211 2018-07-10 21:23:47 I will and do it all the time but when we are talking the final of something as special as Wimbledon, it's different than a run-of-the-mill regular season game...at least for me :)
1212 2018-07-10 21:23:35 Watch Trump May want an oil well
1213 2018-07-10 21:23:34 Look into osmo oil
1214 2018-07-10 21:23:22 Forecast average of $59 for oil is for the 2018-2019 budget period.  #factsmatter
1215 2018-07-10 21:22:37 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
1216 2018-07-10 21:22:26 Secretary Pompeo's message to Iran's bluff to shut down the strait of Hormuz:  “should know that America is committed to keeping sea lines open, keeping the transit of oil available for the entire world,”
#IranRegimeChange
#IRGCTerrorists
1217 2018-07-10 21:22:19 And I can use my favourite cleaner. Eucalyptus oil . It's my favourite scent in the world and smells like beautiful Eucalyptus Trees 
1218 2018-07-10 21:22:18 i’m sick of this heat making my coconut oil melt 
1219 2018-07-10 21:22:15 Prick them all over with a fork, then rub in oil and salt. Put in the oven at 180 for at least 90 minutes, but they can stay in for up to two hours no problem. Gives a nice crispy skin and fluffy interior.
1220 2018-07-10 21:22:11 The EPA is now the coal & oil lobby, with or without Pruitt.
1221 2018-07-10 21:22:11 Fact nd oil
1222 2018-07-10 21:21:51 I dont know if it was you or someone else that said it’s the last week of their pregnancy? But i heard taking a warm bath and massaging what’s swollen, or peppermint oil? Like massage it into whatever is swollen. I’m not exactly sure if we can use peppermint oil while pregnant
1223 2018-07-10 21:21:51 You will find those who tried to tie Dr Moon to oil gas...Smithsonian backed him up
1224 2018-07-10 21:21:49 It's like I'm frying fish with water and not with oil...
1225 2018-07-10 21:21:29 Ty summer for giving me blotchy, oil skin 
1226 2018-07-10 21:21:25 you look like a freakin oil painting! Vincent Van Gogh head, girl! 
1227 2018-07-10 21:21:20 I want to have an oil painting of my queen
1228 2018-07-10 21:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
1229 2018-07-10 21:21:02 Holy fuck why is olive oil so expensive. It's hard eating right.
1230 2018-07-10 21:20:56 She lost her shit at d wring time. Threw him out of the house and got a divorce. You're the one being sentimental. Oil no dey her head. Agree or rest
1231 2018-07-10 21:20:56 from my experience anyway  i did not enjoy it plus really expensive for maintenence an oil change was like 100 bucks
1232 2018-07-10 21:20:50 Q1. The first 30 years was the oil boom era. The oil revenue was too huge for any black mind to handle so greed and looting set in. It was also an era of political instability. Every one wanted a piece of the pie - coups and frequent change of govt
1233 2018-07-10 21:20:07 Watching Fox News while I wait for oil change. They don’t even talk about top 3 biggest reasons why democrats don’t want this Supreme Court nominee. Just propaganda.
1234 2018-07-10 21:19:12 Tomorrow I’m flying 3 bottles of wine and a bottle of olive oil from Rome to Madrid. In and surround by all of my clothes for this trip. Please Rome and Madrid airports, be gentle.
1235 2018-07-10 21:19:09 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
1236 2018-07-10 21:18:53 "Alberta Finance projected a benchmark price of $55 US for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate  crude oil in the March 2017 budget. The actual average price was $53.69 US."
1237 2018-07-10 21:18:52 Actually he said "Britain is a country we want to buy termite oil from."
1238 2018-07-10 21:18:47 Important question: what do you use your coconut oil for?
1239 2018-07-10 21:18:44 I think it's something with the temperature to take dabs. It's also oil upside down. It's like 420 for flower.
1240 2018-07-10 21:18:32 10 min oil change for the win
1241 2018-07-10 21:18:21 I personally was not. My cousin was. She goes for a missions trip to the School for the Deaf and aides their school. From what I'm understanding, a new president is raising oil prices and other stuff causing the unrest.
1242 2018-07-10 21:18:03 Same old story. 
Now that oil price has gone up. 
APC won't say anything.
1243 2018-07-10 21:17:57 Does anyone remember in 2009 when Muammar Gaddafi wanted to set up tents in NY and everyone refused. Guess who obliged  the brutal dictator. Your old pal and snake oil salesman, Donald J. Trump. Making America Pay. Day after Day after Day
1244 2018-07-10 21:17:51 As a new driver I always topped up my oil... infact too much!  I had to drive round while the car coughed out black smoke and jumped! Until the oil went down!!
1245 2018-07-10 21:17:38 なんかめっちゃ腕の関節痛いんだけどなんで？
1246 2018-07-10 21:17:36 A handy place to have a flat! Especially for someone who can't change a tire to save her life ;) My own oil? Sure! No problem! But can't do the tire!
1247 2018-07-10 21:17:23 [Pizza is the good shit how dare you XD
1248 2018-07-10 21:17:21 Don’t perm it!!! It’s so hard being natural but it’s so worth it. My hair is so strong now. Just wash it, deep condition it, apply a little bit of virgin coconut oil and blow dry it.
1249 2018-07-10 21:17:10 Yup stinkies lol  Firstly, they're not oils. No oil content at all. Europe  wide they're are minimum labelling reqs including ingredients, nic strength and universal warning pictograms plus makers details.  Essentially it's the same ingredients as...
1250 2018-07-10 21:17:06 Yeah these metaphors are always open to re-interpretations, and I think it is an opportunity and even an obligation to stand up to such slights of hand. Data is like oil? Ok let's talk about OECD, microplastics, middle-eastern politics, and damage of the suburban sprawl
1251 2018-07-10 21:16:54 For me not as optimal a choice as Wendy's because mcds grills with a salt and pepper mix that has sunflower oil in it to prevent clumping and Im allergic to sunflowers. Even when i ask for no grill mix i chance cross contamination. Wendy's is pure. They grill with salt only.
1252 2018-07-10 21:16:54 It's like asking for a robot to show compassion, its not possible. BP oil spill could have been avoided but profits were at risk SO chances were taken.

1254 2018-07-10 21:16:36 Murkowski should do it since the baggers tried to get rid of her and she won with Dems and indies. They have no loyalty to her and she say kiss my igloo. And if the price is oil drilling, well sometimes you have to make deals with the devil

1257 2018-07-10 21:16:19 Years from now we might need to purchase solar technology from the same nations that are selling us oil... ironically we abdicated the lead because a peanut farmer was succeeded by an Actor. It’s the same now, satisfaction for the short term at the expense of our future.
1258 2018-07-10 21:16:08 I do a double cleanse only when I wear makeup, use coconut oil to take off makeup and then a terry face cloth first. Then I go in with my Tropic cleanser and give my face and neck a lovely massage and steam my face with the bamboo cloth, wipe, rinse and repeat!
1259 2018-07-10 21:16:01 Wrong! Better check with Ceci bragging about how they budgeted for $59. Oil is now $74.
Best to just jog on by....
1260 2018-07-10 21:15:46 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1261 2018-07-10 21:15:40 Ah, never even thought of that. 

Although, I think we're out of olive oil.  It would have had to have been a tub of Stork.
1262 2018-07-10 21:15:38 $CLB's shocking oil prediction during tonight's @MadMoneyOnCNBC
1263 2018-07-10 21:15:19 My cousin brought his rig and 3 grams of oil and idk if he even knows it’s 7/10
1264 2018-07-10 21:15:11 Olive oil mayo....you got good tastes dude!
1265 2018-07-10 21:15:06 I have one bottle of CBD oil capsules--450 mg 30 capsules left in stock. 40 dollars..let me know if you want these. I will probably not order more as sales have slowed down right now.
1266 2018-07-10 21:15:00 I couldn't understand why my home made mayo tasted so bitter even if the extra virgin olive oil I was using was not so bitter. Had to throw it away. Now I use sunflower oil and add some olive oil by hand at the end

Obama opened up the arctic to oil drilling twice.

1272 2018-07-10 21:14:12 Dude I did the same. Went and got an oil change and my tips from work freeballin’. And flip flops on.
1273 2018-07-10 21:14:00 Feeling pretty weak and I need a long pointless chat with my fella. Like I love those car chats about what life would be like if there was no oil left and how pylons look like they have little birds sitting on them.
1274 2018-07-10 21:13:54 No one loves extra virgin olive oil like Jamie Oliver. No one.
1275 2018-07-10 21:13:50 It is absolutely insane, and needs to be standardized across the state. Especially for a state so heavily invested in the oil and gas business, and hugely dependent on records research related to such. It's a fucking nightmare.
1276 2018-07-10 21:13:48 You should know you POS... you have America in term oil.

1284 2018-07-10 21:13:02 good point. It's in-line with the popular "Data is the new Oil" metaphor - while everyone knows "Oil" is primary driver of climate change and being replaced by renewables ;-)

1287 2018-07-10 21:12:20 I would likely separate as well!

1296 2018-07-10 21:11:35 Also, that most emissions “come from 100 companies” is too simplistic. Those are the companies that extract the oil! The ppl and institutions that burn it are far more diffuse. Not saying companies don’t bear more responsibility than ppl. But ignoring FF consumers oversimplifies.
1297 2018-07-10 21:11:32 Europe's oil imports 'dependent on unstable countries'

1301 2018-07-10 21:11:21 Yeah but it’s from Kantar, I get more accurate results by trying to test the oil level in my engine by catapulting a bag of kale at it
1302 2018-07-10 21:11:20 Apparently they’re going for more realism these days - you’re more likely to slip on a chip and end up smothered in hot oil. I’m ashamed of myself for knowing this.
1303 2018-07-10 21:11:16 We can directly it. We have very sensitive instruments for detecting the slight local variations in earths gravity field due to different density of rock in the crust
They are routinely used by prospectors for oil and minerals. Local coastal tide tables are fine tuned using them

1311 2018-07-10 21:10:43 Norway's been subsidizing Teslas for years with nationalized oil industry money, which is an ethical concundrum. It's funny seeing Berlin's right wing senators arguing that the left is too probike, though and then seeing their argument fail again & again
1312 2018-07-10 21:10:37 Tried this once. My cousin called me just to say she needed some oil to fry some chicken and she thinks there’s enough on my face.
1313 2018-07-10 21:10:35 Seems like everybody that supported down south wants oil prices at $150 a barrel. Then you put tariffs on everything that dealt with renewables

1321 2018-07-10 21:09:24 Just so everyone understands I haven’t gotten an oil change since December - I’ve driven to and from Ohio and Virginia and all my city miles inbetween I’m 11,000 miles over my oil change when I said rko me I was not kidding

You forgot about 15 other tired and debunked tropes besides the "oil subsidies."  But nice try.  And you're welcome buy the way.  I hope you enjoy the $7,500 that I and others gifted you.
1324 2018-07-10 21:08:41 Desde semanas antes de la elección ya lo esperaban a 20.30 para diciembre los mercados de futuros. El oil Subió por dramas noruegos y Libios algo bueno ahora que andan buscando más presupuesto  además se relaja cuando se pasa el miedo de los dramas del Trumpetas 
1325 2018-07-10 21:08:36 I'm guessing Ron got a % of an oil deal and or some extra rubles in his offshore bank accounts. Banana Republicans need Putin's help hacking the 2018 midterms too.

1336 2018-07-10 21:07:14 Incidentally  there is one contemporary reference to 'boiling oil' which I think relates to the Malta - where there were supplies of olive oil. The whole boiling oil myth is bonkers.

1344 2018-07-10 21:05:41 There's no logic in Brexit. It's a religion based on the hearsay of snake oil salesman.
1345 2018-07-10 21:05:26 Refineries.... slower, less toxic separation of the oil, and profiting fully from natural resources that have been GIVEN away to foreign Investors that only invested in government pockets...
1346 2018-07-10 21:05:11 Whoever decided that replacing oil with butter for eggs was a good idea, I want to walk up to them...and give 'em a fuckin' high five.
1347 2018-07-10 21:05:10 Hard to do this when the fix was in months before the purported (sham?) vetting occurred. POTUS was patently dishonest (no surprise), but so was Kavanaugh when he heaped praise on POTUS, i.e., “No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with...” Putrid snake oil smell.
1348 2018-07-10 21:05:07 Yes, no point cooking three meals separately! It has helped quite a bit when it comes to oil, marg, herbs, bread. Perhaps salt would have been more useful than herbs and olives though?

1352 2018-07-10 21:04:43 Cannabis oil

The Home Office says that it can contain a maximum THC content of 0.2% and that the THC must not be easily separated from it.

Industrial hemp can be used for things such as building materials and clothing.
1353 2018-07-10 21:04:30 I’d love to oil you up~
1354 2018-07-10 21:04:28 What part of this do you think embodies trickle down economics? The government of Alberta sells its royalty share of oil in kind, so selling the same oil at a higher price increases revenue. Same for energy companies. Same production but higher revenue leads to more taxes paid.
1355 2018-07-10 21:04:24 The argument is  "why does Gov Subsidize oil" every delivery truck, tractor that plows the field, everything runs off of oil which directly helps the poor. Stop the subsidizing and $oil goes up, gas goes up as does the price of food. Tesla is subsidized and benefits only the rich
1356 2018-07-10 21:04:23 Oil did the same last night didn’t get him down till like 3am! 
1357 2018-07-10 21:04:21 Gimme a year. I'll be graduating from dream school of LSU with an engineering degree. I'll be starting my dream of working in the oil field. I'll be making more than I need to be financially stable and any person who's been here with me WILL no longer struggle.
1358 2018-07-10 21:04:13 Is he a body builder? He hasn’t built anything he’s stretched his skin by inflating his arms with oil, drain it and he’s nothing (also he looks really fucking weird and those proportions )
1359 2018-07-10 21:03:50 Y'all swear coconut oil is a fucking cure all. I really just saw this grown ass woman post she was putting coconut oil on open fucking flesh wounds.

1362 2018-07-10 21:03:24 Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. She voted to invade Iraq and kill children, women, men and steal their oil. Hillary is a warmonger woman. How many Americans and Iraqis died? How many are still suffering today? THOUSANDS. 
Keep blaming others. You will lose AGAIN!!!!
1363 2018-07-10 21:03:12 Thats so crazy ive never heard of that!! I dont have dry nail beds at all but never heard of them coming off because of oil! That sucks i would die without nails 
1364 2018-07-10 21:02:55 Went to put olive oil in a pan today when I was making dinner, and my dad comes in saying how bad olive oil is for you when its overheated and that it releases loads of harmful chemicals. Aye stop smoking cigarettes pops and then maybe you can give me health advice x
1365 2018-07-10 21:02:24 Me - do you guys carry oil based crayons or paint?

1366 2018-07-10 21:02:24 Can you take fake tan off with baby oil? Because I am currently oiled up heat to toe and I don’t even know if it works
1367 2018-07-10 21:02:22 it we aren’t there yet, and probably won’t be for a few decades, and it will take time to replicate the distribution system oil companies have in place with electric.

1372 2018-07-10 21:01:56 Btw, has anybody noticed that all of the oil drawdown estimates are always very low? Last year we saw huge decreases in june and july.  Now we have even more exports yet huge drawdowns are not expected during the peak driving week.  #OOTT
1373 2018-07-10 21:01:35 Related to things I've done before such climbing Pruis, exploring further depths of Lucas Oil, off-limit national park areas, etc. Niche places I'm either not allowed to visit,  never see alone, or nooks and crannies nobody in their right mind would think about.
1374 2018-07-10 21:01:29 And so many kids inhaling “vape juice” and thinking it’s ok bc it doesn’t have nicotine. I am scared to see what this oil looks like after being deposited in their lungs in a couple years.

Cardamom essential oil comes from the dried pods of cardamom.  These tiny pods contain multiple seeds which have a strong almost minty flavor. Eastern cultures refer to it as the queen of spices and it boasts many health benefits....here are a few!
1383 2018-07-10 21:00:42 Is sesame oil bad? Isn’t it a seed oil?
1384 2018-07-10 21:00:33 @RobBreakenridge Hey Rob, I’m no fan of corporate bailouts by our government but... since our newly owned pipeline has been stalled since we bought it, you think we could ship oil by bus?  #Greyhound
1385 2018-07-10 21:00:33 Manutd selling Ronaldo is the equivalent of Nigeria selling Cocoa and Crude Oil only to see it processed then sold again as Chocolates and Petroleum products...
Basically selling out for pennies. #Tragic

1387 2018-07-10 21:00:30 What happened?  The oil deal you thought you would be in on never materialized? Realized you had been conned when you saw them mocking you on RT?  Ouch.  Selling out your country only to get humiliated is harsh.
1388 2018-07-10 21:00:20 Crude #oil contract for August delivery reached its highest level since November 2014, above $74/bbl while Trump asks Saudis to produce more oil, via @OGJOnline.
1389 2018-07-10 21:00:09 Hey Maura remember that time the people shilling for big oil were just identical copies of the people lobbying for civil rights
1390 2018-07-10 21:00:07 "Chilli oil enema!" said Theresa Mary May, "It's 10:00PM and I still haven't resigned yet."
1391 2018-07-10 21:00:07 July 10, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1392 2018-07-10 21:00:06 We’ve heard funny stories from people who've attempted a DIY shampoo or conditioner, like their hair going crazy frizzy, or being like an oil slick. Have you got any more outcomes to share?
1393 2018-07-10 21:00:04 But wait, there's more! Bring Jarware into your kitchen with Soap Pumps, Oil Cruets, and Spice Lids that will bring new life to your mason jars. Available at 136 Bank St. downtown and 793 Bank St. in the Glebe.
1394 2018-07-10 20:59:48 Pat Robertson is an old, decrepit  snake oil salesman. The people that watch his show have about the same grip on reality as The Care Bears riding a unicorn to Oz.
1395 2018-07-10 20:59:44 Europe's oil imports 'dependent on unstable countries'
Oil from geopolitically unstable regions such as Russia, Libya and Iraq accounts for 80% of Europe’s imports. No more war for them! Bring our people home!
1396 2018-07-10 20:59:13 I haven’t heard of evening primrose oil! It started working over the weekend? That’s awesome! I hope it keeps continuing to help  thank you! And you too! 
1397 2018-07-10 20:59:13 "What?! Me fall in love with him?! No way!"
1398 2018-07-10 20:59:11 The "Nordic Model" also relies on major income sources from oil and gas.
1399 2018-07-10 20:58:49 Ever wondered we we get them? Because y’all start stupid wars and conquer for oil etc and leave burning countries behind or worse. Hush 
1400 2018-07-10 20:58:46 It seems to me that that she is getting a lot of flak simply because she thinks Elon musk is a bad person because he is rich despite the fact he is working on products that will make oil obsolete.
1401 2018-07-10 20:58:39 I pretty much live off the butter chicken in that lounge, give it a go
1402 2018-07-10 20:58:39 I had that same problem taking painkillers for over a week and a bit. I basically got given suppositories ( they looked like large cod liver oil tablets ). Insert... not kidding 10 seconds later I was about 2 stone lighter. I could post you some lol 
1403 2018-07-10 20:58:32 Not an oil tanker. And not oil.
1404 2018-07-10 20:58:27 You could have saved many readers time if you had included a brief mention of what Chevron means legally - in addition to its being an oil major. Don't make assumptions. Thank you.
1405 2018-07-10 20:58:14 PVR - I watch sports on tape delay all the time.  Mostly Oiler games.  Im very good at being able to not find out anything about the game - stay off social media and all my friends/family know not to talk about the game on the night bc I may be watching delayed.
1406 2018-07-10 20:57:50 Joke ra. Good morning

11093 Mahanagari express
S14 seat no.43 UB is not cleaned
Oil is floating on berth.
1408 2018-07-10 20:57:42 Why does adulting have to suck so much?? I just got my oil changed & now I need new tires??? Such a drag
1409 2018-07-10 20:57:36 This year will mark 5 years me and @WoodsGotGoods been friends. We bonded over castor oil cause we both natural. And we also tried out for the step team together. My seester for life 
1410 2018-07-10 20:57:34 i would imagine they’re mainly giving the robots oil when they get thirsty.
1411 2018-07-10 20:57:29 As a nurse in Canada, medical marajuana is much safer to use and can provide multiple benefits including pain. Even better is CBD oil that does everything marajuana does but does not make you high. Less opioids the better and weed is best option for chronic pain
1412 2018-07-10 20:57:25 Absolutely. Govt has rowed back on support for renewables but giving massive tax breaks to oil and gas industry, including subsidising decommissioning in the North Sea. Also being v. secretive about financial support to nuclear.
1413 2018-07-10 20:57:24 HAPPY INTERNATIONAL OIL DAY!!! 710 upside down is OIL! So if you got those dabs, SMOKE `EM!!!
1414 2018-07-10 20:57:17 my nose is so blocked I can’t even smell the eucalyptus oil that’s I sprinkled on my pillow. that shit is supposed to be strong.
1415 2018-07-10 20:57:17 I’ve just eaten probably the best pizza ever from @dominos (veggie Roma with chilli oil) & then I was sick everywhere. Caused by the people on #LoveIsland not the pizza.
1416 2018-07-10 20:57:11 EVERY OFFICE HAS ONE! Where do they go? What's in there? It isn't the furnace or the oil tank or the hot water heater. What is that door???
1417 2018-07-10 20:57:01 A world where private citizens can own oil rigs? (via joint stock)

Modern society (antibiotics, birth control, air conditioning, heating, cell phones, plastic, cheap food, cheap booze, cheap transit, basically everything…) couldn’t’ve happened w/o oil
1418 2018-07-10 20:56:54 $115 for an oil change. 
1419 2018-07-10 20:56:45 Like Argan oil shampoo
1420 2018-07-10 20:56:40 Please bring oil as a gift , thank you
1421 2018-07-10 20:56:33 U wanna make sunflower oil or wat?
1422 2018-07-10 20:56:31 Let's just say your head is leaking oil.... 
1423 2018-07-10 20:56:30 "Of course I'm sure but worrying about others is normal though."
1424 2018-07-10 20:56:30 Creo que nunca va a dejar de burlarse de los chocolates en la Oil, ósea me rebotó y se burla 
1425 2018-07-10 20:56:23 Vast areas of Russia are unexplored. In those areas are vast amounts of not only Oil & Gas but billions of tonnes of Minerals just waiting to be mined. One needs all that to make not only Washing Machines but Cars as well. Think about the long term. I Know President Trump will.
1426 2018-07-10 20:56:06 Hi Al, the onion rings get fried in oil that could have possibly been used for frying fish. While we aim to have 1 side of the fryer for Vegetarian dishes and another one for Chicken and fish we cannot guarantee this. Thanks, Alex
1427 2018-07-10 20:55:59 No one asked you to. Europe's oil imports 'dependent on unstable countries'
Oil from geopolitically unstable regions such as Russia, Libya and Iraq accounts for 80% of Europe’s imports, report shows who was the oil for? You our blood your contempt
1428 2018-07-10 20:55:41 I can go and find you my recipe tomorrow or so. Basically baking soda + shea butter + almond oil + fragrance (essential oil) of your choice. And you'll need about a fingernail size piece a day. Works better than anything else I've encountered.
1429 2018-07-10 20:55:21 "I don't understand why I have to pay so much to have my clothes dry cleaned. I'm on a fixed income."

If I'm broke and need my oil changed I don't complain about the prices at the shop, I do it myself.

1430 2018-07-10 20:55:08 The scent of coconut oil is heavenly
1431 2018-07-10 20:54:54 Had to block him Guy. I'm trying to cut down on my snake oil purchases.
1432 2018-07-10 20:54:21 You went all cockney at the end with  “oil Bolier”
1433 2018-07-10 20:54:17 Using a disposable heating pad because I still haven’t replaced my heating pad yet. Works ok. Add a castor oil pack and ooh its better.
1434 2018-07-10 20:54:12 Good job I didn't come out with Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1435 2018-07-10 20:54:06 "Obsessed? N-No nothing like that!!"
1436 2018-07-10 20:54:02 I can see that you are clearly against TMX, but figured the stop pipelines hashtag went beyond and covered all oil production.  why there aren't campaigns worldwide? #dirtymoney
1437 2018-07-10 20:54:00 A new theory I want to explore has to do with water solubility of a particular phenol linked to bitterness in olive oil
1438 2018-07-10 20:53:56 I scheduled an oil change, dr appt, and wisdom tooth surgery all in the same week. What kinda adulting system am I on 
1439 2018-07-10 20:53:56 I have a problem with irresponsible oil & gas extraction. As an independent operator, I live where I work. My family drinks the water and breathes the air in the midst of where we made a living. Me and many like me have no tolerance for willful environmental neglect.
1440 2018-07-10 20:53:53 CBD infused water is now available at Holland and Barrett: Uses, risks and benefits 

CBD OIL became available on UK shelves at the beginning of the year when Holland and Barrett became the first retailer to stock it. The  street health store has now CBD infused water -
1441 2018-07-10 20:53:46 craving for mang inasal's chicken oil. lemme google if i can make a pirated version of it lols
1442 2018-07-10 20:53:43 She feels a lot of stuff that has nothing to do with business or people’s feeling about her. She has become a thorn in people’s side and the squeaky wheel gets the oil... if she was avidly making movies and getting paid regularly, I seriously doubt she would pursue this.
1443 2018-07-10 20:53:33 2 day power outage, eish! Thanks for telling me. Well done to some of your neighbours who already reported the fault to ZESA 24hr line 042706453 & were allocated fault no. 100543. I was told when I called & that tomorrow they hope to oil test your transformer. Let’s follow up
1444 2018-07-10 20:53:29 Shaved legs + coconut oil = orgasm
1445 2018-07-10 20:53:29 Cool that our very wise leaders are making sure we can transport oil but not ppl in western Canada
1446 2018-07-10 20:53:23 Fuck. I have a blocked ear, used the oil drops from the chemist, now it’s also blocked with oil. Kill me now.
1447 2018-07-10 20:53:17 What type of person waits for an hour on a tuesday in the rain at 8 AM for an oil change?
1448 2018-07-10 20:53:16 thought baby oil in the bath was a sick idea, nearly died. don’t do it, so slippy!!!!!  flailing round like a greased up slug
1449 2018-07-10 20:52:54 chili oil > sriracha
1450 2018-07-10 20:52:50 When it comes to Iraq we were all lied to when it came to the the nuclear weapons. My personal feeling was we were there to take over the oil because Bush was heavily invested in it.
1451 2018-07-10 20:52:43 A fresh oil change be having you feeling like you in a brand new car... 
1452 2018-07-10 20:52:43 His gift will be the lifting of sanctions against Russia... thus opening up billions and billions of dollars of profits from oil.  We won’t be able to count all the zeros.
1453 2018-07-10 20:52:32 "They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:" ~Matthew 25:3 #Jesus #God #Bible
1454 2018-07-10 20:52:29 That’s enough to defend oneself. She’s not planning to invade an oil rich country with her friends as far as I know. All she wants is to be able to defend herself in case of rape or some attack.
1455 2018-07-10 20:52:15 ugh i don’t feel like going to get my oil changed 
1456 2018-07-10 20:51:56 It says it in the photo that 100% wasn't written by a north sea oil worker. It says you should have to pass a piss test. If there's alcohol in your system, you wouldn't pass the test.
1457 2018-07-10 20:51:40 "But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps." ~Matthew 25:4 #Jesus #God #Bible
1458 2018-07-10 20:51:38 47 (7-10): In surveys, people say they'll pay twice what they're actually willing to spend. #hypothetical_bias #Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill #environmental_cleanup
1459 2018-07-10 20:51:33 Hi David....my mum has sent daily photos of him.
See him tomorrow. All sounds exciting here today.
1460 2018-07-10 20:51:25 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1461 2018-07-10 20:51:15 Sanctions will be gone soon, Republican Fascists relinquish responsibilities to Putin. Now we will have Exxon $500 Billion Oil deal,  Follow the money, plenty to go around. 
These are the Freedom Fighters you elected,, and they said to you Kiss My Ass.
1462 2018-07-10 20:51:12 How much of a premium is justified, I don't know....I just recall that there is an actual measurable improvement in oil/gas recovery when using these ideally shaped sands vs ordinary sand.
1463 2018-07-10 20:50:34 Do you have any problems with granulation? I have made up a gel since my daughter was a baby that totally stops it happening. Aloe Gel with Roman Chamomile & Lavender essential oils. I just use KY jelly to put the new button in as you shouldnt use anything oil based.
1464 2018-07-10 20:50:18 No, Kirill. I’m only going to say this one more time - the oil goes ON the skin.
1465 2018-07-10 20:50:07 new country , new currency , new investments , selling oil in that new currency - whats not to like for investment and banking in Scotland?

Its not like we dont have oil , eco generation , and taxation including corporate to have at home.

Send them a copy of the McCrone report.
1466 2018-07-10 20:49:57 Karn is still recovering from the phyrexian oil addiction lol
1467 2018-07-10 20:49:53 I just got some citronella essential oil bitch I’m untouchable
1468 2018-07-10 20:49:51 CBD oil.  Tanks of it.
1469 2018-07-10 20:49:51 I tried dipping it into olive oil. not the same
1470 2018-07-10 20:49:46 I  have been on a plane for hours and only just managed to get wifi
I can see everyone is happy so that is great.
Good luck to you Roofers hound and everybody.
1471 2018-07-10 20:49:30 And what snake oil salesman promised you that?
1472 2018-07-10 20:49:28 Every “surprisingly vegan” food is still chock full of soybean oil.
1473 2018-07-10 20:49:22 Barny is going to be one happy dog
1474 2018-07-10 20:49:21 Will China turn to Iran to replace US oil subject to tariffs??
1475 2018-07-10 20:49:19 my mom really got CBD oil for me lmaoo
1476 2018-07-10 20:49:08 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
1477 2018-07-10 20:49:05 Not sure the UK Government is listening to EVers,  probably the fact we are running out of oil and killing the planet on top of the emission targets we have to hit,  these are Worldwide targets and we will still be 10 yrs behind other Nations
1478 2018-07-10 20:48:55 What can he get from Putin but oil? Which USA buys cheaper from Saudi Arabia. Putin cannot sell him Mercedes cars or Bosch washing machines  And he won't need NATO because he'll be Big Buddies with the Enemy (Russia) --- Prediction Defeated
1479 2018-07-10 20:48:29 I don’t think it’s about hearing about a scarcity—it’s seeing a scarcity priced into the cost of oil which provides the incentive for alternatives.
1480 2018-07-10 20:48:18 Dang, the $2.48 gal is Pretty Cheap.  Cant go too much lower without laying off oil/gas employees
1481 2018-07-10 20:48:09 Texas Oil Twitter finna screw and chop ya mentions #RedNation RT @CheckTheResume: Damn Lakers better than the Rockets

1485 2018-07-10 20:47:49 Also 710 upside down is OIL lol
1486 2018-07-10 20:47:40 Sometimes the Libyan Coast Guard take the people from the boats, sometimes Europe’s naval fleet, or the NGOs, or oil tankers etc
1487 2018-07-10 20:47:37 Literally just sat in the bathroom for the past hour covered in baby oil to get out the shower with fresh pale skin, god bless the person who told me this. Bye patchy tan 
1488 2018-07-10 20:47:34 It’s boneless 4/20 lmaooo basically oil day 4/20
1489 2018-07-10 20:47:31 "And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out." ~Matthew 25:8 #Jesus #God #Bible
1490 2018-07-10 20:47:28 Jajajajaja de acuerdo, cuando hablen del precio del Oil alto, es hora de salir corriendo
1491 2018-07-10 20:47:22 In 1987 and Republicans have been touting the money angle for years absent tRUmp's total disdain for defending our allies from Russia. Current crop see Putin favorably, opposing socialist West, oil deals, aiding their elections

tree in Mauritius.
1498 2018-07-10 20:46:15 Businesses just factor in fines as part of the cost of their products. Milliom dollar fines don't actually effect much when you make billions
See repeated oil spills and repeated incidents of food poisoning or lack of adequate testing or safety specs

1500 2018-07-10 20:46:00 I have to do it after a bath to make sure shes very relaxed :) plus since using coconut oil instead of something else i personally find it so much easier to take it out and replace without upsetting her x
1501 2018-07-10 20:45:45 Fish oil and apple cider vinegar are the worst things to break at amazon 
1502 2018-07-10 20:45:43 ......And oil on the march higher.   Table is being set.

1504 2018-07-10 20:45:28 Tfw you take a massive hit of your oil pen and then look over and an entire day camp of 3rd graders is about to walk by in single file

1506 2018-07-10 20:45:07 I love driving my whip after a oil change and tune up 
1507 2018-07-10 20:45:04 Being a service advisor has me sniffing out oil leaks in cars at the stop light.

1523 2018-07-10 20:42:33 As a self-professed hypocrite who believes in climate change while living and working in northern AB, @WesTaylorUCP is woefully ignorant of the facts.

Put bluntly, there's nothing ethical about how oil comes out of the ground in this province. He's confusing ethical with legal.
1524 2018-07-10 20:42:20 UAE Energy Min (OPEC president) Mazrouei: Balancing oil market is  best recipe for maintaining investment  We will always fail if we target an oil price
1525 2018-07-10 20:42:13 I mentioned yesterday already it is your drones starting from Rammstein fighting in the American Interest your Wars for Oil and the Germans payed most of the Facilities don't get greedy!

1527 2018-07-10 20:42:04 Got a bit of an ant problem this year. So I laid out the raid and mixed in a few drops of cannabis oil. Figure they should go out on a high note.

1529 2018-07-10 20:41:53 It has health benefits but in a U shape, too much isn't good either. I make hot cocoa with 1/2 teaspoon coconut oil, 1-2 tablespoons baking Cocoa powder and if I have it 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also add a pinch of cardamom powder cause I'm used to that in my coffee.
1530 2018-07-10 20:41:49 Nice and yellow inside and oil looks fine. Going to take a sample to the merchant before sending any in though!!
1531 2018-07-10 20:41:48 Also, his initial opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline began when he had a financial interest in a competing pipeline that would have crossed Canada and shipped oil from Vancouver rather than sending it to US refineries in Louisiana.

1536 2018-07-10 20:40:53 Even so, major problems like pollution and climate change wouldn’t rest in the hands of a few billionaires. It NEEDS to be a global effort. They’re not going to buy out century-old coal and oil industries and convert them into clean power facilities. It’d cause mass turbulence in

1548 2018-07-10 20:39:56 Isn't there any country to supply palm oil with whom we have good relationship??? If so, either deport or raise the import duty to sky high... Either you let live or you Die...

1563 2018-07-10 20:38:23 Easy. Land is cheap and plentiful and oil allows the poorly run Red State to remain profitable. 

Only Red States that give more than take are oil states (Texas and Alaska).

1584 2018-07-10 20:36:15 P.S. The oil in avocado oil comes from the flesh of the fruit, not the seed, so there's no justification for calling it a seed oil.
HOWEVER, coconuts are the seeds of coconut trees, so cold-pressed coconut oil is technically a seed oil (but still not toxic like soybean oil).
1585 2018-07-10 20:36:13 Trudeau has rewarded terror, committed treason, subverted the capitalism in the oil industry, is currently planning to steal the CPP and had violated his own policy of sexism....he needs to resign to preserve the dignity of his office.
1586 2018-07-10 20:36:09 So I just made the maddest pot of stew ever but, spoilt it by adding palm oil. Somehow, I can’t help but blame this on all the times I chose to willingly associate with Yoruba people in the past

1602 2018-07-10 20:34:09 A quid pro quo: Arab countries want Iran isolated as much as Israel does.  Putin eliminates Iran from Syria in exchange for lifting sanctions against RU for its invasion of Ukraine.  Then Russia takes over Ukraine, has oil dominance and on to others. That’s how I read it.
1603 2018-07-10 20:34:05 It surprises me that any of this(oil boom/bust) surprises anyone. It can go on longer than you think and get waaaay more extreme than you think. This has happened countless times. Go study Midland, TX, those people have literally adapted their life to it.

1682 2018-07-10 20:25:56 Something really smells Edward and its starting to stink. November dead line for Iran oil exports. Good way to get support behind U.S is to force Iran to attack how that can happen I have no idea. Something is going to happen before November and soon me thinks.

1701 2018-07-10 20:22:33 I don’t need reproductive health care. Why should I pay inflated prices for it? Do you pay for an oil change every time you go to the car wash?
1702 2018-07-10 20:22:30 So I pay for the car. And the fuel.

He gets a free car with free fuel, siphons half the fuel each time I pay for it, sells that fuel for cash, and then pays for an oil change every 3 months. And he ends up with $219 million at the end of the year.
1703 2018-07-10 20:22:22 Iran and Israel do not see eye to eye! Rhetorics run high every day from both. Yet Israel which is India's major arms and ammunition and agriculture development partner knows that India needs to buy oil from Iran due to its affordable price. If Israel does not disapprove why USA?
1704 2018-07-10 20:22:22 #Iran VP Eshaq Jahangiri, acknowledged that U.S. #sanctions would hurt the #economy, but promised to "sell as much #oil as we can & protect banking.

1712 2018-07-10 20:21:21 Every time I get mad at my laptop being dodgy I’m forced to remind myself I spilt coconut oil on the keys a month after having it and realistically it should be dead after almost 3 years, then I’m grateful again. It’s a humbling exercise
1713 2018-07-10 20:21:14 i used tea tree oil shampoo from TJs but i think u can just add the oil directly to any shampoo you have and it should work!!
1714 2018-07-10 20:21:14 Should have brought my text book to read while I’m waiting for my oil to be changed.

1720 2018-07-10 20:20:21 Whenever I needed a oil change or car wash I would let it ride and make sure I parked my car near my fathers so he would notice and handle it. Lol
1721 2018-07-10 20:20:03 My guess is it may have been 3x3 which he still should've jumped at...oh well.

1733 2018-07-10 20:18:58 Maybe you can help me out on something. If you care about climate change, as I do, why didn’t you talk to your mother about her pushing fracking all over the world to benefit US oil and gas companies. You do know leaks from fracking have released methane, more potent #GHG, right?
1734 2018-07-10 20:18:52 It’s hard to believe he wouldn’t bite on 4x4,this was probably his best chance at a long term deal.

1750 2018-07-10 20:17:06 Who the hell is Donald Trump of the USA to deter India from buying oil from Iran? We are buying oil at the least of global rates from Iran! India will not go back on the Chah Bahar seaport deal with Iran whether Trump likes it or not!
1751 2018-07-10 20:16:56 Or talk him into splitting the cost of the car, you fill up the tank when you use it, and he pays for the oil changes?

1805 2018-07-10 20:09:48 According to experts

#Oil prices will jump to $ 150
Due to the continued growth of #global demand for oil as well as weak #investment in the oil #industry.
The highest price in #history was $147 in 2008

oil will remain the most important #energy artery until 2040

#OOTT #opec
1806 2018-07-10 20:09:46 No. Just no. A neighbour of mine had an original 20s Moggie, it used to blat around the roads here in a cloud of oil smoke like a Tiger Moth without wings. Replaced it with a 'modern' 3 wheeler with a noisy V twin, no whiney electric motor please. Leave that for Tesla!!

1808 2018-07-10 20:09:37 Ooo I would cut out the pharmaceuticals all together before you risk any health effects that would require more medicines. Have you done microneedling before? Also to balance out hormones for the face; try a plant based organic diet :D and tea tree oil & African black soap
1809 2018-07-10 20:09:28 He is man city fan!!! A club that tires to buy league with arab oil money!!!
1810 2018-07-10 20:09:22 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for this laugh.
1811 2018-07-10 20:09:21 Same here. Last month I vaped CBD oil and man! Best sleep I had in years and I had 9 days of Lucid Dreams that where awesome. Total recall of dreams all month. Great energy all day. Ran out about 4 days ago. Shitty sleep last night.
1812 2018-07-10 20:09:19 I thought u slap oil really fast
1813 2018-07-10 20:09:05 Do you know that Exxon Mobil in the number 1 oil company. Exxon Mobil Corp is involved in the exploration, development, and distribution of oil, gas, and petroleum products. It operates through three main sections, these are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. #exxon #papusha
1814 2018-07-10 20:09:03 If u can read ,ok
1815 2018-07-10 20:09:02 It’s 7/10 & I have a pinpoint size worth of oil & no rig :~) I fail as a stoner on this day every year hahah
1816 2018-07-10 20:08:52 Steaks and asparagus!  (Seriously, grill asparagus, brushed with olive oil and lemon juice. SO GOOD.)
1817 2018-07-10 20:08:50 Just gonna throw this out here..if I were a Big Oil exec. collecting big fat $$ from all the petroleum prods being consumed on our roads would I want the train to succeed? Maybe, just maybe I would lobby against/obstruct it's success?
1818 2018-07-10 20:08:42 my skin is so oily it looks like I took a bottle of baby oil and slapped it on my face. help.
1819 2018-07-10 20:08:35 We know PUTIN is not over US getting a good deal (stolen according to PUTIN) on Alaska and has stated repeatedly he would like to have it back. Perhaps TRUMP will offer him a deal on oil in the sea or portions of it back. The part where he can see SARAH PALINS house.
1820 2018-07-10 20:08:35 "Many celebs use deodorant on the red carpet for their face. lt absorbs the oil and stops the shine!"

1823 2018-07-10 20:08:17 Do you have any specific examples to back up your broad claims? Obama did his best to close down oil&gas exploration and drilling as well as mining. Those great paying American jobs are coming back under Trump policies which are the complete opposite of Obama policies
1824 2018-07-10 20:08:15 This rats will survive , but 10-20 years most car will be electric = oil value/demand will go down whit it

Once they make no money for the US arm industry ,nobody will cares about them anymore .  Could be civil a war and killing each other for scraps
1825 2018-07-10 20:08:14 Pretty happy with that as long as WV does not get any devolved power or money from the oil revenue without Holyrood deciding how much they are allow to get.  And after a while Independence
1826 2018-07-10 20:08:11 “Whole, chopped, red, green, fresh, dried, ground, pickled, steeped in oil, the variety was infinite.”
1827 2018-07-10 20:08:04 yea we won't change your oil just wipe the dirt of your filter and charge you a arm and leg for nothing but we won't fart in your car eh!
1828 2018-07-10 20:08:03 What's up with everybody saying oil field men aren't faithful , we are whole husbands out here
1829 2018-07-10 20:08:03 Glitter is more like phyrexian oil, as it spreads to what it touches and never stops until it consumes all
1830 2018-07-10 20:08:00 Performance plus oil and it be a black n yellow paint scheme
1831 2018-07-10 20:07:56 Thank you for the shoutout! DM me for a FREE oil sample 
1832 2018-07-10 20:07:55 i Blame Liberal media bias who favour the oil industrial complex.
1833 2018-07-10 20:07:53 foreign toymakers who are MERELY the pawns of big oil are doing the DIRTY WORK of the TUNA canneries and nobody seems to care
1834 2018-07-10 20:07:48 Like a squeezed orange into water then cleanse your face with it? And did you just dab lavender oil on it? X
1835 2018-07-10 20:07:36 I would gladly take a financial hit if it was due to a genuine effort to curb climate change.  However, if the government quit spending unimaginable amounts of taxpayer $ subsidizing everything from big oil to banks & other BIG businesses it wouldn’t be necessary. @JustinTrudeau
1836 2018-07-10 20:07:29 I just used some green tea olive oil conditioner and my shit is charming ULTRA now
1837 2018-07-10 20:07:20 Since I've been basically ot of salad dressing I've been keeping it simple. Drizzle of olive oil, drizzle of balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Call it a day and it taste great
1838 2018-07-10 20:07:19 Not sure. But I know he isnt an A frame structure on an oil rig. Learn how to spell laaaa nie
1839 2018-07-10 20:07:14 #isitok that the media went mental over children having life changing cannabis oil confiscated but didn’t mention @PaulFlynnMP ‘s second reading of his bill to legalise cannabis for medicinal purposes that could help these children and a lot of other ppl.
1840 2018-07-10 20:07:14 When was the last time there was an Trans Mountain oil tanker spill in BC'S waters? 
Never. 
Fact.
1841 2018-07-10 20:06:54 Do you remember the meal plan Alec got you with the turkey in coconut oil. I do not miss that 
1842 2018-07-10 20:06:51 Sis, I once watched a grown adult bite a bath oil in half and eat it before anyone could stop him 
1843 2018-07-10 20:06:43 PLEASE start taking CBD oil Dr!  Take the brand (or any reputable brand) called "For the People".  It is made WITHOUT the THC in it and will save your life!!!!!!!

1845 2018-07-10 20:06:25 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1846 2018-07-10 20:06:02 If you go up to a mirror and turn the lights off and repeat the phrase "we struck oil" three times the US military will come liberate you.
1847 2018-07-10 20:05:38 Did you know that unrefined red palm oil can be used to heal scars, stretch marks, and moisturize skin? Learn about the many uses of palm oil on our website.
1848 2018-07-10 20:05:36 Ooh them are niceeeee. Put some oil in the refrigerator nd when its cold put it on your scalp. Or microwave a wet rag then put it on your head with a shower cap
1849 2018-07-10 20:05:33 Tric’oil’ure?

1856 2018-07-10 20:04:48 Only 11 eps mean we're at the halfway mark. Meaning something BIG! Hopefully happy tears but history suggest otherwise
1857 2018-07-10 20:04:39 I'll teach and as well show the people a practical approach to become successful in areas of Fisheries and oil palm plantation. I've gotten experience as Agric Advisor, Fisheries Specialist, NYSC Advocate of MDGs and ex- Students' Union Leader. #ReachBackPullUp
1858 2018-07-10 20:04:34 Bye bye dirty oil money, new stadium. Welcome back mediocrity.

But that was an excruciatingly boring article that in no way attempted to answer the question of "How long does cannabis oil last?"
1861 2018-07-10 20:04:12 Women are stronger than men, I never said they weren’t.

1863 2018-07-10 20:03:59 They should've done something along the lines of Lucas Oil Field in Indy.  Like an old warehouse with the glass walls. That would've fit in A LOT better.

1865 2018-07-10 20:03:09 Dude...Coffee, avocado oil and Kerrygold butter ...total rad combo! 

And I hate coffee
1866 2018-07-10 20:02:53 I paid for my own oil change today. I feel like an actual adult and I do not like it at all
1867 2018-07-10 20:02:46 Hey Andy, I'm really sorry that you feel this way about our use of palm oil. We are doing our best to change the way we use palm oil in our products in the future. Thanks - Dillon
1868 2018-07-10 20:02:41 I’m dead I wish I could do my oil change myself cause I have to wait to long
1869 2018-07-10 20:02:34 you mean forcing min wage up doesnt help because the job just disappears altogether and the untalked about upstream effect of those in higher positions demanding more pay in comparison to their underlings who are suddenly making more for no reason? shocking I tell ya!
1870 2018-07-10 20:02:32 Matt Kenseth in the Black and Yellow Ford Fusion sponsored by some random oil company who I have never heard of. I think Performance Plus is their name 
1871 2018-07-10 20:02:29 Oil, rape and pick pockets

1873 2018-07-10 20:02:11 Because they are a wonderful people, with a fantastic culture and and awful lot of oil.
1874 2018-07-10 20:02:10 got some CBD oil. hopefully it’ll help 
1875 2018-07-10 20:02:08 Even if you don't drive your restored classic very often, don't ignore the need for oil changes, tire pressure checks, and checking hoses and belts. Over time, the oil's viscosity is lost, so it is no longer able to properly lubricate.
1876 2018-07-10 20:02:01 I have to get my oil changed soon HE :^)
1877 2018-07-10 20:02:00 I’m convinced a lot of these internet “eco warriors” are just snake oil salesmen. Be careful out there.
1878 2018-07-10 20:01:46 Small brain: Preferring asparagus prepared with oil and salt

1880 2018-07-10 20:01:13 So, all in one day my rototiller decided to dump all its oil on my black top. My washing machine has took crap on me and stopped working. And my refrigerator door handle fell off. Yep I enjoy my white privilege.

1885 2018-07-10 20:00:34 Called to make an oil change appointment and asked the guy which oil he would recommend. He told me that since I’m a woman and probably just put my key in the ignition and go he’d recommend synthetic oil. You bet I’m coming into the shop with extensive oil knowledge on Friday...

1888 2018-07-10 20:00:09 What medium is this? Collage, digital painting, oil painting???? I can't tell lol
1889 2018-07-10 20:00:09 They sold $2B worth of sand in Texas last year. 

All of it went to assist with fracking. Margins are higher for dirt than oil at $80 a ton. 

I’m sure we will look back at this and laugh.

1911 2018-07-10 19:57:02 Oil and arms sales obviously
1912 2018-07-10 19:56:48 Need to ask:  Is it an essential oil such that, for $45, you got less than an ounce or, did it require you buying oil drums and building a storage shed?
1913 2018-07-10 19:56:46 It's not running on me when that happens lol. It's just on my skin and the sugar scrubs that don't do that are usually in some thick oil gunk that my skin hates.
1914 2018-07-10 19:56:36 Agree with the palm oil but they could source sustainably farmed NZ real clean meat
1915 2018-07-10 19:56:33 Now we're cooking with oil.
1916 2018-07-10 19:56:19 BTW important≠: Since no #KochBrothers in CN & little oil, they have embraced green energy, robotics, innovation like crazy. Coal plants in CN  legacy they try to get rid of, in USA 45 insists on them. Now even mining done by robots.
1917 2018-07-10 19:56:02 the day before going someplace is really the worst. i gotta finish shopping, pack, clean out my car, shave, get my eyebrows & nails done, make sure my dog is taken care of, change my oil... i just don’t want to go anymore.
1918 2018-07-10 19:55:58 Niewiele ? Mam większą wyobraźnię . Kornik szalał w puszczy białowieskiej a tu pan nie widzi analogii ? Od kiedy to w chronionym prawem rezerwacie można się budować ? Mam nadzieję że ktoś za to odpowie
1919 2018-07-10 19:55:54 Surely they’re looking for where to store all that wax and baby oil?

1921 2018-07-10 19:55:37 Oil gon cost $10k during the Fall
1922 2018-07-10 19:55:16 LOL.  I worked with a woman in London whose son owned a very smart hair salon.  One of the trainees washed the woman hair with machine oil by mistake thinking it was lacquer.  Her hair turned green!
1923 2018-07-10 19:55:14 Hah I didn’t even realize it was 7/10 hahah Happy Oil Day ya Dabtards
1924 2018-07-10 19:55:09 Sand ridge oil company in Andrews are a bunch of bitches.
1925 2018-07-10 19:55:00 I made brownies and cookies!! Candy video was a little confusi. Coconut oil? Right? You have some tips? This was my first real success I watched so many utube videos!! Ahhhh 
1926 2018-07-10 19:54:55 Sewa stop spitting lies. We know you’re rich  oil money
1927 2018-07-10 19:54:47 Can we talk about how guys can literally just cheap shampoo their hair and it comes out so soft? Meanwhile, I use expensive shampoo and conditioner, detangler, 2 kinds of oil, and an engineering marvel of a brush and mine still feels like a cactus. Neato 
1928 2018-07-10 19:54:42 My goodness has Courtois been fantastic throughout the tourney
1929 2018-07-10 19:54:40 CBD oil, smoking mmj, THC drops - I have tried just about everything and it doesn't help my pain. The only thing it works on for me is my insomnia, but even with compassionate pricing I can't afford it. ODSP will not help cover costs either. 
1930 2018-07-10 19:54:35 used to the cliche brownie types. But there’s oil, troches that absorb through the mucosa and avoid first pass metabolism, and probably many more options. Most things marijuana will “treat” shouldn’t need that quick options too
1931 2018-07-10 19:54:33 If you believe CO2 is bad, the last thing you want to do is discourage the use of natural gas.

For the same heating value, burning natural gas produces 40% less CO2 than coal and oil.

Natural gas has little or no partulate matter too.
1932 2018-07-10 19:54:31 That too, but primarily he’s pandering to his oil $ donors & undoing what Obama did.
1933 2018-07-10 19:54:30 U NIGGAZ SEEN THEM OIL PRICES??? And this is the off-season!!!
1934 2018-07-10 19:54:20 KOKO OIL TO RUB ON HIS MUSCLE
1935 2018-07-10 19:54:14 if I put oil on my skin and then go under the sun, am I frying my skin?
1936 2018-07-10 19:54:12 Putin must have given him a spare oil pipeline or Faberge egg.
1937 2018-07-10 19:54:07 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

1939 2018-07-10 19:53:52 Bam! Gots to do better. Be careful out here. What you get got by, some peanut oil?
1940 2018-07-10 19:53:48 Trump would start oil drilling in the Grand Canyon and give Delaware to Putin.
1941 2018-07-10 19:53:35 My dirtbag soccer dive smells alternatively of cigarettes, pot smoke, and coconut oil.
1942 2018-07-10 19:53:30 Neither. You stick to the manufacturer's recommended oil. If you have an older car, a synthetic blend oil is acceptable. You can go from a 5w to a 10w if your oil pressure is insufficient. "Summer" oil is not a thing.
1943 2018-07-10 19:53:29 Definitely agree that African countries need to focus on processing raw materials to generate high-value refined products. It’s the same damn mistake we make with crude oil.
1944 2018-07-10 19:53:17 Trump blames #OPEC but Trump’s sanctions on #Venezuela have accelerated the sharp  decline in its oil production.
#Trump is as much at #fault as OPEC his but he blames them

The American ppl pay the #price

1947 2018-07-10 19:52:42 ya, he pays for it with his "Make America Great Again" Credit Card...  The Federal Reserve.  That and the 300 million he took as a pay-off from the Russian Oil Giant Rosneff

1951 2018-07-10 19:52:23 In Organic Chemistry lab today we had to distill the essential oil: eugenol from ground cloves. After today I can safely say I am one step closer to being a hippie.
1952 2018-07-10 19:52:17 Imagine if when you cried the tears were jojoba oil imagine how good your skin would look

1955 2018-07-10 19:52:02 You need oil.. See I thought you did!! My gf said you can use flowers lmao 
1956 2018-07-10 19:51:55 Well that's BLOODY RIDICULOUS, taking into consideration all that filthy OIL we have had for 40 years! What have WM done with it?! I'll tell you - CRONE REPORT & WM having (at that point in time) 90% of Economic levers in Scotland! TIME FOR INDEPENDENCE. #DissolveTheUnion
1957 2018-07-10 19:51:54 I simply wasn’t understanding when I had to get a transmission flush and oil change which came out to $225 and new tires that came out to $531 all at the same damn time last month. 

I was SICK.
1958 2018-07-10 19:51:53 Lol, so far just lavender and tea tree oil, and only with excessive topical use, and so far only in prepubescent boys. I diffuse most of my oils for my asthma, and clean with them. Just a small few I apply topically.

1960 2018-07-10 19:51:25 Here's love and support to all Americans. Our criticism and resistance is for those who don't care about any nation, those who feather their own nests, who drill, pollute and make war for oil profits, and who don't care for rights & justice.
1961 2018-07-10 19:51:18 Do you support oil companies drilling off our coast? Some regulations are the only reason we still have beautiful beaches in California.
1962 2018-07-10 19:51:10 Yes but if you are going camping it might help prevent more! Another tip spray skin and clothes. And dot lavender oil all around your tent
1963 2018-07-10 19:50:56 Tryna find a product that gives me a balance between a healthy glow and the oil slick my skin normally is. 
Help?
1964 2018-07-10 19:50:52 Dreading taking my car in for a simple oil change tomorrow because I'm always afraid there is going to be a bajillion things wrong with my car that I didn't realize.
1965 2018-07-10 19:50:22 On a Saturday when the markets are shut..... very useful.  Utter horseshit, snake oil salesman
1966 2018-07-10 19:50:02 That’s it..where’s the beard oil.
1967 2018-07-10 19:50:00 US & Saudi will suck out every dollar through oil price rise. OIL is new tool instead of Fed rate hike.

Don't be under impression that US has opened up it's own Oil & Shale reserves to "fill any gap" in world.
1968 2018-07-10 19:49:58 KXL pipeline=built with shoddy pipe & shoddy welding=only a matter of time before it leaks. KXL goes thru America's Breadbasket + the GR8 Ogallala Aquifer, fresh H2O source for 8 US states. +99% of KXL tar sand oil is to be exported~using MILLIONS of gallons of #TX H2O to process
1969 2018-07-10 19:49:51 $ATH.TO is approaching 4-year resistance. It's been smacked down around this point many times now. 
If it breaks this resistance, it'll flash one of the more epic buy signals we've seen on the TSX.
1.95-2.05ish is the line. Oil prices might do it, but might have to be earnings.
1970 2018-07-10 19:49:51 Castor oil does wonders for my Afro 
1971 2018-07-10 19:49:50 I WONDER IF POPEYES CHICKEN IS FRIED IN OLIVE OIL ?! 
1972 2018-07-10 19:49:47 I love peanut butter but will only buy product with no added sugar and no added palm oil. Wake up @wholeearthfoods. People don’t like palm oil. And you’re deluded if you think any of it is sustainable.
1973 2018-07-10 19:49:42 I’ve never even heard of curd soap. Tea tree oil in an all natural bug killer. The listerine I learned about with my snakes.
1974 2018-07-10 19:49:41 We dont eat Chemicals in Europe, and we dont go to war for oil and ask our allies to join us.
1975 2018-07-10 19:49:34 Wonderful. What about the rest of the amendments, and the whole constitution for that matter? Are you still worried that Obama’s is coming for your guns? Just like everything else u have done, this is a non issue, you’re selling snake oil. Icicle man. #HonorMatters
1976 2018-07-10 19:49:07 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1977 2018-07-10 19:49:00 that’s oil , you’re milk .. ain’t no point in trynna mix lol

1980 2018-07-10 19:48:23 I love the oil and oregano that come on the sub.. the bread seems fresher to me than most.  They slice the meat..versus pre-cut meats.. still not as good as a "Pub Sub" @Publix @PubSubs_on_sale #MyOpinion
1981 2018-07-10 19:48:18 EIA forecasts that total U.S. crude oil and petroleum product net imports will fall from an annual average of 3.7 million b/d in 2017 to an average of 2.4 million b/d in 2018 and to an average of 1.6 million b/d in 2019, which would be the lowest level of net imports since 1958
1982 2018-07-10 19:48:15 Scandinavian countries are a wet dream for bigots, 95% white. How do you even try to compare a country of 10 million to one of 300 million. They sit on top of one of the largest oil reserves in the world, that pays 40% of their healthcare bill. And get to have no defense budget
1983 2018-07-10 19:48:12 I've read somewhere bathi moisturize & add oil morning and night,  Always wear a wig cap
1984 2018-07-10 19:48:09 Oil, gas, coal, uranium, silver, gold.......all those rare earth metals.  Farmland.  That guy's being an idiot.
1985 2018-07-10 19:48:05 I believe Trump is the karma for letting the Bush regime destroy our nation and set the Middle East on fire...with no repercussions, except profits from black market Iraq oil.  Trump in GWB footsteps.  Second chance to not screw up.
The minister has nailed it.
1986 2018-07-10 19:48:01 @Slomins They will put whatever amount of oil in your tank, burn your system and then have u go bankrupt. Please stay away from them
1987 2018-07-10 19:47:54 The sad part is that they sold the cow right before she started giving oil instead of milk
1988 2018-07-10 19:47:51 Coconut oil is my favorite 

I use it for stretch marks, acne, teeth whitener, bad breath, masking the smell of bud, healthy fats, lubrication

1990 2018-07-10 19:47:47 #SouthsudanOilPollution. In the Khartoum Peace Agreement (KPA), 
they made sure that all the damages to the oil facilities in Heglig are going to be compensated. But the farmlands that have been destroyed by oil pollution aren't talked about. Why? @hz_soh @SUSSESSS
1991 2018-07-10 19:47:44 OIL DAY 7/10 B2G1 ON ALL KAYA CONCENTRATES AND CARTRIDGES! EAST COAST CHEESE STEAKS ARE HERE! COME GET SOME OIL AND SOME FUEL FOR YOUR BELLY
1992 2018-07-10 19:47:38 When Trump meets with Putin he's going to remove all sanctions put on Russia from our Gov. so Putin can finish that multimillion-dollar oil deal that Tillerson was supposed to complete.
1993 2018-07-10 19:47:30 I am "doing mental acrobatics to say that a pipeline blockade inevitably leads to more oil-by-rail"???

What sort of mental acrobatics is necessary in this case? This is simple supply and demand. To suggest it is not is to ignore the west coast fossil fuel market #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1994 2018-07-10 19:47:27 How do 17,085 dead people vote??? Oh, they must be Democrats that explains it......
1995 2018-07-10 19:47:26 Been lost over many news cycles that charity for St Jude was effectively shut down. 
The left must hate children. 
Reviving the story for political ads?
1996 2018-07-10 19:47:25 Loving this month’s #lfbeautybox -especially the @DrLancerRx Face Oil!  That’s a Christmas pressie idea for anyone wondering

1998 2018-07-10 19:47:18 We have had Maritime accidents bc of language barriers. The ship that rand into the New Orleans pier was due to 3 language barrier and I was in an oil spill and our crew could not follow directions bc they did not speak English.

2001 2018-07-10 19:46:57 If the population prefers bicycling to big cars and trucks, there are very good outcomes.

(Discouraging bicycling is a rightie cause in the US. Less oil and more exercise is somehow a loss of sovereignty issue.)
2002 2018-07-10 19:46:53 Oil, screwing BAM. Bitch I think you are confusing it with sex
2003 2018-07-10 19:46:51 To not having enough moisture or hydration (oil or water content), in that case, if hydration is needed: a product with humectants like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and honey will be  if moisture is needed: oils are actually good to apply! However, complicated stuff aside,
2004 2018-07-10 19:46:31 *never* use tinfoil (or a microwave) on a baked potato. It requires a loving manual coating of olive oil, then a manual salt rub before being baked in all its naked glory 

Crispy heaven.

(Serve with tuna mayo & black pepper).
2005 2018-07-10 19:46:30 I learned that coconut oil is great, especially as a substitute for butter when baking cookies

2014 2018-07-10 19:45:31 I think it's fine, EXCEPT if it contains palm oil because that could be the end of the actual world.

Have I kept the mood light?

2023 2018-07-10 19:45:09 I'm not expecting anything happening till China starts major dump of US Bonds and restructure of oil payments  What will happen then just pray 

Just going to dig in till then  Maybe Putin take some people to Sochi ?
2024 2018-07-10 19:45:08 So is oil and you don't see countries sharing that for free. It's a Welsh commodity and England should pay for it rather than just taking what it wants from the devolved nations as per usual.

2033 2018-07-10 19:44:14 Went Benbrook to run errands.  Only spun out once.  However, being taught how to correct a spin buy turning steering wheel into the direction of the spin, I was able to correct.  Be careful out there.  Lots of oil on the roads and the run is making it hazardess!

2044 2018-07-10 19:43:03 I have two bottles. I’ve been using it plus coconut oil. Praying and hoping they go away. They are just now coming up haven’t had any my entire pregnancy 
2045 2018-07-10 19:42:57 Try ghee (clarified butter). And lots of it. You'll be an instant convert.

If sticking with coconut oil, try adding more than you think you need. Makes better popcorn

2053 2018-07-10 19:41:45 You feel like a vegetable dish consisting of onions, zucchini, tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers, fried and stewed in oil and sometimes served cold...because you are "whipping that cheddar"?
2054 2018-07-10 19:41:43 Bloody hell, I’d forgotten the oil drama.
2055 2018-07-10 19:41:38 5 is a good number.

Did you know they had a secret menu item, CDB oil, that was available only to certain patients..?
2058 2018-07-10 19:41:07 Hmm. We just go with coconut oil and sea salt.

2077 2018-07-10 19:38:13 The thing is, is that this recovery is different. Oil companies aren't hiring every joe schmoe highschool dropout to swing hammers for 30 bucks and hour, nor is having say, a chem engineer degree a slam dunk to a 6 figure salary in O&G. #ableg
2078 2018-07-10 19:37:57 Voting to legalize medical marijuana is voting for smokable marijuana. We didn’t vote on medical thc oil. They just fucked us

2080 2018-07-10 19:37:35 Also, do you know if this includes smoking oil (vape pen) or only the plant?
2081 2018-07-10 19:37:17 Don't forget the cannabis oil, Mr. Blow.  And hang in there yourself -- we need you and value greatly your writing and speaking out.
2082 2018-07-10 19:37:03 Dear Bradford file. Sorry, we don’t want your hormone laced meat, GM food or your pointless corn oil lake. If you want to know why, look at the size of your population. Sorry. We buy a lot of the stuff you sell - you have access to our markets. Your companies don’t pay tax on it

2086 2018-07-10 19:36:33 I just picked up the Jessicurl deep conditioning treatment. Only tried it once so far, but liked it. Most oils or oil-in-creams just turn my hair into a grease slick, unsurprisingly.
2087 2018-07-10 19:36:32 Yea lmao !! You make oil and from that gummy? I can DEFINITELY do that!! I made oil and butter!! 
2088 2018-07-10 19:36:31 Keep my industry alive, #OKC!! Oil and gas is the backbone of our economy
2089 2018-07-10 19:36:21 The only bad thing about frozen is that it got rid of the Norway ride in Epcot ,where theres a polar bear and trolls telling you how to build an oil rig
2090 2018-07-10 19:36:15 I read a piece on this a few months ago, can't remember who published it off the top of my head. The main concerns were wage expectations and worried that the new employer would be a placeholder until oil recovers.
2091 2018-07-10 19:35:50 this is one squirrely corner kick away from being a tie match
2092 2018-07-10 19:35:43 as others have said, economic crisis is the likeliest means of ousting him. a sustained slide in the oil price combined with global recession would probably do it

the problem is what would replace him, there's never been a peaceful transition of leadership in russia, like, ever

2096 2018-07-10 19:35:09 It's 3:33 & I just realized it's also 7/10. Cannabis is OIL. As well as currency. & nutrition. That's why we can't have it.
2097 2018-07-10 19:35:05 Makes me less sympathetic to Europe and generally more critical.  Instead of 2% of GDP the amount we spend should be more proportional to EU combined.
2098 2018-07-10 19:34:55 France’s passes are slicker than an oil spill
2099 2018-07-10 19:34:46 No.
But the glitter spreads. It will get everywhere you go. And those who it touches won't truly be able to get rid of it. It's like some kind of very sticky oil that can change you and make you look more metallic...
2100 2018-07-10 19:34:45 @SaraEisen TX is NOT an oil state!
jesus
2101 2018-07-10 19:34:44 There is a level of GLORY in you that REVEALS itself only as you go through CRUSHING experiences. The olive must be crushed to extract the oil. Don't hate the process...embrace it! #GloryIsComing
2102 2018-07-10 19:34:39 Tesla was murdered because he found free energy for everyone. Big oil wants to drain the earth and destroy it over fake money, fake value. How ridiculous is it to destroy your only life source for fake things?!!  I hope big oil burns in hell
2103 2018-07-10 19:34:20 From where did they get that money, exactly? Heating appliances? Oil? Coal? Perhaps it was someone else in the picture influencing these claims?I don't know. This was also prior to the technology & methodology that has been thoroughly developed,before advanced satellites etc.
2104 2018-07-10 19:34:15 This should be a fine parody account on the stupidity of the car economy, but I'm not sure that it actually is. 
What I wonder does the cyclist do with her money? Save it for investment rather than squander it on environmentally disastrous oil and gas fuelled profligacy?
2105 2018-07-10 19:34:06 I have no beef with responsible oil/gas extraction. Oil/gas has made many in my family a good living. I have a problem with policies that undermine worker protections and the environment. Dislike the environmental ruin that my state is in, drained of its resources and still poor.
2106 2018-07-10 19:34:02 Only way tax cuts put more in your wallet is if you do not drive or use oil.
2107 2018-07-10 19:33:43 I took my car in for an oil change, then after it was done we (matt, mom & I) went out to eat. Not even 30 mins after my oil change I got a friend request on Facebook from one of the guys who worked there. He saw my name on my Carle badge & looked me up. That’s fricken creepy.
2108 2018-07-10 19:33:37 Headline should say 'total idiot who injects muscles with oil to look unnatural eats diet of cat food'. He is not a bodybuilder and any true bodybuilder would be ashamed to be associated with him!!! #totaltwat #unnatural #needshisheadtesting
2109 2018-07-10 19:33:23 You know it’s gunna be a good day when you’re making breakfast & oil pops into your open eye 
2110 2018-07-10 19:33:21 The price of oil is lower than it would have been if Hillary were President. Thus, LESS oil revenue for Putin. 

US is now supplying arms to Ukraine. Hillary would have continued Obama's policy of no arms. 

US forces recently killed several 100 Russians in Syria.

2121 2018-07-10 19:32:22 We managed the equivalent in 1938/1939 but then we had a Govt on our side which made decent preparations and issued instructions. In 1940 we cooked on an oil stove after the gas works was bombed, but we had prepared for this eventuality.

2129 2018-07-10 19:31:39 @realDonaldTrump so there should be an emphasis everywhere that there is no exemption in the oil sanctions. It is vital for us to sanction 100% of oil, and we will never retreat.
2130 2018-07-10 19:31:37 The S&P 500 stock index hit a four-month high on Tuesday, boosted by higher oil prices and expectations for strong earnings, while the U.S. dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen as investors bought riskier assets.
2131 2018-07-10 19:31:25 The problem arises when oil coal and gas get shit on so much that they run  out of workers. Then you will really have no energy when you plug your  computer in to go on facebook. #libtard

2134 2018-07-10 19:31:20 @ShepNewsTeam Why do you instigate friction regarding our @POTUS It seems that you always seem to pour more oil on the flame  to initiate more dishonest rhetoric. I am so sick  of hearing your biased negative demeanor. You should move to Russia  they need reporters.
2135 2018-07-10 19:31:16 @realDonaldTrump Your government must be a voice, and these contradictory statements will increase disputes. Exemption from oil sanctions is a disaster and we can never accept such a thing, I do not think you will accept it,

2145 2018-07-10 19:29:43 Does this ban also vaping  the oil?
2146 2018-07-10 19:29:31 Be nice! By your response you are just taking a page out of Trump's vile book.
2147 2018-07-10 19:29:26 it’s better for ur hair to wash less anyway bc washing too often gets rid of natural oil and it makes ur hair get greasy faster
2148 2018-07-10 19:29:23 Transmission, starter, three batteries, oil leak, now air conditioner is out....yep this is the worst vehicle ever
2149 2018-07-10 19:29:19 why not maintain a position on both $LUV and an oil name ? (i have $APC)... airlines will eventually pass the cost on to the consumer and oil stocks have not kept pace with oil
2150 2018-07-10 19:29:19 Okay War in Iraq, hundreds Killed and injured with thousands of Iraqies dead and displaced brought ISIS into being and IT was Regime change about OIL I will forgive Labour because Blair was more right wing than Thatcher But people wanted to Win power Ring a Bell anyone.
2151 2018-07-10 19:29:17 Your support of Trump.  CEO, oil and gas.
2152 2018-07-10 19:29:11 One more thing, cannabis oil can also be smoked and does not cause the damage that smoking the plant does.

2157 2018-07-10 19:28:51 It's, uh, oil. And my coffee screams back at me in defiance of such an anathema.
2158 2018-07-10 19:28:49 It’s a brand by a Japanese make up artist Munemi Imai,

Their argan oil is really good 
And their brightening serum works really good and instantly for her,
And the packaging is really beautiful 
You should check it
2159 2018-07-10 19:28:43 Our Government uses food produced by these agriculture specialists to trade internationally for oil & tariffs on imports

2161 2018-07-10 19:28:02 what is your alternative? We use many products in our daily lives .  We import oil from several countries that no one is protesting. Natural resources are our economy. The industry is well or maybe even overly regulated. Easy to sit back & so no if your income isn’t involved
2162 2018-07-10 19:28:00 China buys $1B per month of US oil. This will change.

2167 2018-07-10 19:27:33 cheap labour equals more profit not rocket science slavery is still going on but now paid for slavery, people are commodities just like flour the more you have the lower the cost of buying it that is why OPEC limit producing oil to keep prices high

2172 2018-07-10 19:26:30 Pro Tip - My wife and I only buy fresh-made peanut butter at @WholeFoods now, just making a small amount in the machine, enough to last for a week or so, then we get more. It's always fresh and you never have to stir in all the oil. It's cheaper, too!
2173 2018-07-10 19:26:20 But fr. 112$ for the tire, 25$ for the car wash, and now windshield wipers  I have to get an oil change next

It ministers greatly to many ppl, including me.
2178 2018-07-10 19:25:52 Nope. All fresh. Sliced and set in olive oil this morning.

2192 2018-07-10 19:23:17 Oil companies must compete with other energy providers and make a profit for their shareholders. Only monopolies like, for example, federal governments are free to throw away money.

2210 2018-07-10 19:21:06 Hypocrisy. No reason we can’t do both. Everyday we use products made from oil . We import oil from Venezuela, Saudia Arabia, Iraq etc. We almost give away our oil to the US. Our economy can do much better with all our resources. We r being held to much higher standard.
2211 2018-07-10 19:21:06 That's a complete non-statement. So, you expected them to try to sell less oil than they could? The quality of journalism these days is just horrible

Jobs aren't up. UI is down & people calling themselves "self employed" while making zip is way up bcz there aren't any jobs. 
Instead of insulting our intelligence with a word salad covered in BS dressing how about get to work on a jobs plan .
2217 2018-07-10 19:20:15 @karenhunter squeaky wheel gets the oil...unless it keeps squeaking, then it gets replaced
2218 2018-07-10 19:20:14 Castor oil should do the job
2219 2018-07-10 19:20:13 The oil change wasn't the issue it's the fact that tried to sell me a $1000 brake job
2220 2018-07-10 19:20:09 710 flipped is the word Oil. It refers to oil forms and is harmful! Be safe today and make good choices!

2226 2018-07-10 19:18:52 Not sure what “enough said” means in relation to oil and gas. But I am certain that 99% of people living in the USA buy and consume oil and gas products on a daily basis.
2227 2018-07-10 19:18:47 I will need some oil on my shoulders to get out 
2228 2018-07-10 19:18:24 Taught my boyfriend how to use oil cleanser to take the sticker gunk right off of computer parts

2233 2018-07-10 19:17:41 I've already said that the US government introducing measures to affect the oil market should only be done in extreme circumstances. What if OPEC literally stopped all oil for a month?

2244 2018-07-10 19:16:57 UAE Energy Minister Mazrouei says OPEC will 'always fail' if they target oil prices. Says group shouldn't panic over sanctions
2245 2018-07-10 19:16:52 More oil and gas subsidies... what’s that, $5billion spent in the oil patch by the gov of Canada this year?... so far? Probably more, but how much did solar or wind get? This should be imposed on the industry not taxpayers.
2246 2018-07-10 19:16:37 this stock is being manipulated by shorts...it should be over for the by now.  5 red days in a row with oil going green doesn't add up.

2262 2018-07-10 19:15:06 I just mis-typed partnership, writing partnersnip instead. Which I think either sounds tasty ("Mmmm, partnersnip with a little bit of olive oil and fresh ground pepper.") or snarky ("Don't get all partnersnippy with me! I just asked you a simple question.").
2263 2018-07-10 19:15:05 You guys, you remember that this isn't the first time that Trillo's yacht has been in the news, right? Remember he was storing used yacht oil in leaky containers behind a rental property he owned?
2264 2018-07-10 19:15:02 $150 Oil is all BS talk. Nobody wants that Nobody!!!
2265 2018-07-10 19:14:59 This is perpetuated by democrat thieves. Pelosi types are snake oil salesmen for powerful globalists. The Globalists keep the shills pampered. The shills convince citizens to trust them. It's heinous, those are death camps.

2269 2018-07-10 19:14:39 which took years to arrive at the current equilibrium. To put it in a simplified fashion. If there is less oil/meat in the dish humans tend to consume more grain. That would cause another hype for the demand of staple grains such as rice/wheat/millet etc. All require land to grow

No major data and no new #TradeWar barns; on the other end of the trade spectrum, Germany & China progressed free trade talks;global equities continued to tick higher; oil choppy after suggestions US may ease restrictions on Iran exports.  take 1-0 lead over 
2272 2018-07-10 19:14:07 Libya comes back after these negotiations and Iran waivers - with this much oil front end from OPEC phys will keep getting smashed. Has to be all back end led to keep the spare cap argument alive.

2276 2018-07-10 19:13:44 I go to get an oil change, the guy lifts up the hood of my car & there’s a fucking slice of PIZZA UNDER THE HOOD. 
2277 2018-07-10 19:13:43 That is where simple comprehension skills are important. Most people lack them. Especially those that support Trump. Obama did'nt "give" Iran $150B. Obama lifted sanctions that allowed Iran to collect THEIR OWN MONEY ( it was $60B) owed to them from other countries for oil.

2285 2018-07-10 19:12:56 Those chest pains are most likely due to the inflammation from years of accumulation due to overconsumption of sugar and unhealthy oils like vegetable oil.  Enjoy your bacon.

2358 2018-07-10 19:04:08 Hmmmm..... For someone like me who doesn't rub body lotion, won't it bleach me? Cus that's the reason I'm scared of using any lotion or oil.
2359 2018-07-10 19:04:01 Dear mr.Amar r u think that someone had a PHD. in electrical engineer don’t know about compact power plant or mobile power plant ?!

2361 2018-07-10 19:03:52 In a working world where loggers get dismembered, fishermen get drowned, miners get blown up, oil rig crew get burned and nurses get ebola, if the worst thing that happens to professors is not being called "Professor," maybe you should just STFU and deal.
2362 2018-07-10 19:03:47 But....they but their gas and oil from Russia.
2363 2018-07-10 19:03:44 Once when eucalyptus oil git in my nose... Painful but rewarding
2364 2018-07-10 19:03:44 First you test your weapons in other countries (60's-90's) then you steal the oil, then you get mad cause they defend themselves, then they come to you then it is called terrorism then the civilizations privacy is over, then the conclusion is let world deal with it, now WW3 comin
2365 2018-07-10 19:03:31 ...stop making cars...before it's too late...the world need to change...be the company that creates that change...not a polluting oil grabbing traffic jam machine...
2366 2018-07-10 19:03:20 Upside down it spells OIL. So instead of weed on 4/20, it's dabs, wax, or oil on 7/10
2367 2018-07-10 19:03:19 My Ontario Based Company with 15 employees, in small town Alliston, gets almost half of its revenue from the oil sands, and almost another half from underground mining. Resources pay our mortgages. We support AB and SK all the way! @Provix_

2370 2018-07-10 19:03:03 1/Basically it comes down to the world progressing. Practically everything we have today is based on some type of natural resource,(oil being one of the biggest), so if the world wants to keep it going we need to extract more oil. The global demand is still growing and Canada is
2371 2018-07-10 19:03:01 Billionaires such as Musk are the reason we need to clean up the planet in the first place. And historically with Standard Oil they fought tooth and nail against any form of regulations and they were barely put into place. With significantly more money in the hands of oligarchs
2372 2018-07-10 19:02:59 Try Goo-Gone (or orange oil). It works miracles.

2377 2018-07-10 19:02:31 Were you living in America when oblamer was destroying the economy? 1.8%  GDP, food stamps up, unemployment up, industries destroyed. Trump was voted in because the old guard SUCKED and did not know how to fix just destroy. The economy was just part oil f it.

2380 2018-07-10 19:02:22 @JeffreeStar looks incredible in th norvina palette review. Just gorgeous. Btw I had the same problem on my eyelid- switched to green clean makeup remover and put coconut oil on it at night and it was gone.
2381 2018-07-10 19:02:22 would just adding eggs and oil have the same effect though, that just sounds weird af to me i aint gonna lie
2382 2018-07-10 19:02:21 Gentlemen. When frying any type of food use Grape Seed Oil. It has a high capacity for heat and it is light on taste. Be sure to buy organic and that you purchase one used for cooking.   You can also use Extra Virgin Olive Oil.   You may also want to purchase a Fry Daddy.
2383 2018-07-10 19:02:14 Trump Oil. It's a new product.
2384 2018-07-10 19:02:04 He is. He's also a streamer that post youtube videos mostly about #TheSims3 and #TheSims4 and he's my top favorite! Just like your my "Sweet Mike" he's "Oil Tot" to me. Oddly enough all three people that I talk to from the UK I have nicknames for them! :) Love my UK people!
2385 2018-07-10 19:01:51 After I get my car's oil change I'm gonna go donate some plasma and make some change on the side. I should probably go scarf some food down before I go though
2386 2018-07-10 19:01:50 Eu should just agree to drop all tariffs. Eu won't buy much more anyways and then buy all oil in euros. Without the petro dollar the US would collapse in a year or two under its debt. Trump would be much nicer after. Might even smile a little.
2387 2018-07-10 19:01:40 Great list.  I have to chortle when I see people being accused of being in the pay of oil companies...I actually work for an oilfield service company, and the idea that oil companies are just spreading money around to random people is laughable.
2388 2018-07-10 19:01:33 I’ve had before, really tasty. Mayo is just egg yolk and oil, which are common ingredients in cakes!

8 ounces of oil is enough
2390 2018-07-10 19:01:20 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2391 2018-07-10 19:01:10 A toe (tonne of oil equivalent) is the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil, about 42 gigajoules.
2392 2018-07-10 19:00:49 @SheaMoisture how do I place an order for the new 100% virgin coconut oil facial wipes? It’s not on the site or seems to not be in stores.
2393 2018-07-10 19:00:49 He was tweeting about how Oil Prices are high due to OPEC.
Then put Sanctions on Iran which will hit Oil Supply leading to spike in Crude prices again.
2394 2018-07-10 19:00:47 Cast iron skillet and a pad of butter is the best way to crisp up the outsides. Smoke the oil and 15-20 secs and it’s perfect.
2395 2018-07-10 19:00:45 A loaner? For an oil change? What am I, some sort of a psychopath?

The only reason I take it there in the first place is I’ve gotta get it up on a stand to get my big ass under it. Then, the first and last time I did it, the filter location bathed me and the garage in used lube.

2402 2018-07-10 19:00:02 Soya has a high nutrition value. It can produce cooking oil. The spent residue is a very nutritious animal feed which goes into cattle farming and in turn produces good meat protein. It's not that without it the country will go hungry but it will severely disrupt human food chain
2403 2018-07-10 19:00:02 Okay all you essential oil fans out there! I know LITERALLY NOTHING about it, but I hear great things! what do you like? What do you love? and what sets your product apart from its competition?

2407 2018-07-10 18:59:42 When America can convince Europeans (and Americans) that American wine, olive oil, cheeses, hormone treated meat and milk are better than European versions then you might fix the trade deficit.
Meanwhile, tell American farmers to make better & cleaner products instead.

2414 2018-07-10 18:59:00 Hmm. You might try magnesium to help with the absorption of vitamin D. 
I use magnesium oil so I don’t get an upset stomach upset. 
Epsom salt soaks or baths work as well.

2418 2018-07-10 18:58:37 My experience with the international business people (a couple who were appointed to positions by Bush and Obama) is that they had ties to foreign governments. In fact, one of them owned oil wells in Africa which I questioned as to how he got the permission to drill.
2419 2018-07-10 18:58:23 There was just a single Republican who voted against Scott Pruitt, a former oil lobbyist who doesn't believe in climate change.
And now Pruitt was replaced by a former coal lobbyist...

Don't kid yourself. Republicans are either dumb as rocks or bought by fossil fuel companies.

2432 2018-07-10 18:56:30 Well it's all searchable and factual.  Look up flexner report.

Look up fact Monsanto funded by Rockefeller Foundation

Find one point not factual and I'll delete it ....

Or keep head in sand. They hold controlling stake in BP, ExxonMobil via Standard Oil etc etc etc
2433 2018-07-10 18:56:08 I DO KNOW. I just refuse to do all the work for someone who is challenging me -- especially when ALL OF THAT INFO IS VERY READILY AVAILABLE. Go out and educate yourself -- it's not my job to do EVERYTHING FOR YOU. All you have to do is LITERALLY CLICK on the links in my piece.
2434 2018-07-10 18:55:43 Are these the same people who found the moon was made cheese???? Trump won. End of storie. Investigate Podesta making $$ from Russian oil comp. Or clinton selling our uranium to Putin or the lost emails. Hillary being a patriot, now there is fiction.
2435 2018-07-10 18:55:35 Producers are bureaucrats, in reality. Most of the producers in the Middle East answer to their governments, who set the amount of production. I would trust DC more than Saudi Arabia, for sure. Consumers have very little to do with oil prices, which is a shame.

2446 2018-07-10 18:54:32 lmao I worked for a plant that processed fish oil so I started reading up about fish and fisheries and why we eat the types that we do and it kinda became an obsession???
2447 2018-07-10 18:54:21 And yet public opinion is that humans are only partially to blame for climate change; hence we can't do anything but be passive victims. That's the pervasive effect of doubt sown by oil lobbyists.
2448 2018-07-10 18:54:08 Yes! Coconut is excellent.  Thank you,  I'm going to add more to my diet.  I use olive oil and avocado oil but I've heard coconut oil has a lot more to offer.  The taste is a bit intense,  but I could get used to it.

2457 2018-07-10 18:53:05 There isn't evidence that a foreign power affected the result, but plenty that Banks is a windup artist and CA were snake oil salesmen. Putin's troll farm had no more impact than Obama's "back of the queue" intervention.

2482 2018-07-10 18:49:59 but people will argue against large scale change like strict env. regulations and clean energy bills bc those are harder to "prove" they'll change anything, and there's more corporate interest in oil and other fossil fuels. it becomes more of a climate change debate
2483 2018-07-10 18:49:52 20% OFF ALL OIL CARTRIDGES!!!
2484 2018-07-10 18:49:48 The only good thing about a heat wave is that it melts all my coconut oil
2485 2018-07-10 18:49:44 Guys guys being a president is not an easy job,let's support our president and he will turn south Africa around to the best, and those African countries have all that we need at the moment ,like oil ,petrol So that the prices can go down,
2486 2018-07-10 18:49:41 My god ... don’t even mention Alaska... he may do it. 

More probable would be Trump moving forward with the multi billion dollar oil deal that could put $ Billions in Putin’s pockets. -currently on hold.. as a return on his investment.
2487 2018-07-10 18:49:36 After my 2 days slide them off wit oil? #destene
2488 2018-07-10 18:49:36 is he talking about the Flames or Oil? hopefully not the flames because that D looks legit right now
2489 2018-07-10 18:49:36 If anyone wants to know how the day has been, I waited forever and a day for an oil change. Went and got some groceries...DROPPED THE EGGS IN THE PARKING LOT.
2490 2018-07-10 18:49:30 I finally ordered african black soap, jojoba oil, and bamboo toothbrushes for myself off amazon 
2491 2018-07-10 18:49:27 My stoner friends say it's a bud dipped in hash oil and dusted with keif ( weed powder).

2494 2018-07-10 18:48:57 Anyone know a good hack to dye/tint mdf? Something fast and that doesn't require multiple stages and loads of prep. So far I've tried oil based marker (hard to get even coverage) and clothing dye (still has a brown tint). Must be easily attainable in the UK.
2495 2018-07-10 18:48:49 Climate destroyed. #Fossilfuels sector wins. #Russia is petrostate. Melting #Arctic ice opens trade route. Builds #ice breakers so Europeans can ship cheaper toys from #China to #Antwerp. Then why not ship oil in giant tankers. What can go wrong?
2496 2018-07-10 18:48:49 Maybe you have to apply the booze via oil can, like the Tin Man.
2497 2018-07-10 18:48:46 Try getting the castor oil hair shampoo plus the conditioner from purpul hair too, the reviews are insane
2498 2018-07-10 18:48:25 Pogba style of play as smooth as baby oil
2499 2018-07-10 18:48:08 France, USA and Britain sell them weapons. Britain just signed an arm/oil deal with Biya Paul the 86yr old vermin. The Oil Company is called #NewAge they will drill offshore oil and give Biya weapons to keep his regime in place. That is the Evil West we dealing with.
2500 2018-07-10 18:48:01 My phone is at 15%, I’m waiting for an oil change and bc I’m a woman they said it’ll be 2 hours. There’s 1 other car here like 6 dudes walking around. But i have to wait 2 hours. Y’all need anything while i aimlessly walk around this Walmart?
2501 2018-07-10 18:47:46 today i bought olive oil and 30 month matured parmesan and I’m following a Jamie Oliver recipe. Guess u could call me a Tory ! (but please don’t that would be bullying)
2502 2018-07-10 18:47:44 Yes, normal people play a part and should try harder. But it’s not normal people spilling oil in the oceans or pumping out a majority of carbon dioxide. It’s naive to think that corporations aren’t willfully damaging the planet for profits.

2505 2018-07-10 18:47:37 Outlook positive, but has the government the nerve to ditch their big oil backers and embrace this report? 
I doubt it. As usual it's down to public pressure to drive it.

2506 2018-07-10 18:47:28 Do you have sensitive skin?

Firstly, I think you should stop using coconut oil as it tends to clog pores, and cause breakouts
2507 2018-07-10 18:47:24 Moriel: + in Elrond's direct company - at least not when she was so far away from the Hall of Fire. So, with a heavy sigh, she quickly lathered away the oil from her hair and skin, and climbed out. After drying off, she found a dress of a similar azure laid out for + @Silvian_
2508 2018-07-10 18:47:23 Democrats cannot ever be allowed a majority again.
2509 2018-07-10 18:47:22 I had for lunch : #watermelon chunks and a lemon-olive oil marinated #chickpeas with some #Arugula.
2510 2018-07-10 18:47:20 You will sana, suba neworry. Castor oil makes hair so soft.

2513 2018-07-10 18:46:42 My cousins instagram makes me wish I had left high school & sold out my beliefs & went to Tech to pursue land management instead of being a hippy stoner fuck & going to Arkansas to pursue being a stoner w friends.
I had a job lined up w a fat starting salary but I said fuck oil

2517 2018-07-10 18:46:12 one moment of wanting bacon with my hot dog = HOW LONG OF BACON OIL PAIN HOW LOOOOOOOONG
2518 2018-07-10 18:46:10 Many Districts in Panem, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of grain and oil (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in shipments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the Capitol?
2519 2018-07-10 18:46:09 Subsidizing oil for the poor... and then making the poor dependent on (the leftist) government... so they won't vote for anything else... and making the oil much more expensive for everyone else... No, use your brain here, not your naivety.
2520 2018-07-10 18:45:56 Idiot:  So glad this is peanut free flight”

Her: “ What are you doing?”
Me : “ Making sure”
2521 2018-07-10 18:45:47 I love that one too honestly , the olive oil one just works sooo much better for my hair. Worrks amazing as a leave in !
2522 2018-07-10 18:45:45 what is happening in Venezuela is the US with its economic sanctions has been attempting a coup to get the leftist gov't overthrown & replaced by a far-right authoritative thatll do mor favorable contracts w/western oil corps just like we did to Iran back in 1953
2523 2018-07-10 18:45:39 Koch brothers want to destroy our fresh water sources to make  with oil/gas-but you are right that makes them “very loveable”!!!

2526 2018-07-10 18:45:26 Olive oil.
2527 2018-07-10 18:45:26 Have you heard an intelligent argument supporting the bearish case? It seems like the only argument is "oil will eventually go down because that's what it always does".
2528 2018-07-10 18:45:19 OIL DEMAND GOING TO BE ROBUST IN NEXT TEN YEARS: MAZROUEI

Like the CBO, another one who sees no US recession for a decade
2529 2018-07-10 18:45:09 A bot must try coconut oil.
A bot must not find a good stick.
A bot must not make sure your whole body is limber before practicing poomsae.
2530 2018-07-10 18:44:57 I started using castor oil on my hair this week, guys I better pop 
2531 2018-07-10 18:44:47 I talk cash shit I’m slicker than an oil spill
2532 2018-07-10 18:44:46 Okay WTF 7/10 on the digital clock upside down is OIL. It's mf oil day mf I didn't even know. def going to highlyfe to get the walking rig
2533 2018-07-10 18:44:46 My plug is a grower, I love sippin’ oil 
2534 2018-07-10 18:44:42 Less plastic straw bans, more expropriation of private oil companies.
2535 2018-07-10 18:44:25 I’m thinking the department would be focused on not becoming extinct by staying up to date on your security practices? That’s Cyber’s core talk track. All the other dinos could join and our tagline could be: be the oil not the dino? (There’s a reason I’m not in marketing).
2536 2018-07-10 18:44:17 Sweden is taking in refugees from wars that US is waging in middle east countries since the 80's to secure oil. Will we be reimbursed?
2537 2018-07-10 18:44:08 Gas went up 25 cents a gallon again. Thanks Trump and your economic policy. Big Oil loves Trump. Imagine why.
2538 2018-07-10 18:44:08 A real sign of maturity is getting excited over small things like an oil change and car wash lmfao

2541 2018-07-10 18:43:46 Lol! This generator repairer will be surprised I don't call him anymore. I've mastered the art of changing oil & plugs myself. Since that's all they do 
2542 2018-07-10 18:43:35 There are links to everything in my piece. Or you can Google it!
2543 2018-07-10 18:43:31 Steve is obviously correct, Jess. There is a massive conspiracy between climate scientists, NASA, NOAA, 195 countries, @SethMacFarlane and Chevron, Exxon, Shell and BP (the oil companies now concede most of the science) to trick people into thinking CO2 is causing warming.
2544 2018-07-10 18:43:13 Some of us don’t. We live in a 16’x16’ HOUSE. Off-grid. Oil lamps for light, and some solar string-lights. Water cones from rain-catchment. Barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck. But we are grateful for what we do have, and give/do what we can for others. 
2545 2018-07-10 18:43:11 happy oil day to my stoner homies may the slab gods bless you
2546 2018-07-10 18:42:57 Just to be clear: oil and gas industry = not hurting the environment. Weed smoke = devils poisonous gas.

2549 2018-07-10 18:42:33 Rumors of Asian countries planning to cut down Iranian oil to Zero due to US sanctions.  US & Saudi oil most likely to bridge the gap.

2551 2018-07-10 18:42:08 Excuse me, but I never took a violent action against you.  Now, full accountability,  I did lob a grenade at @BronyRobbins , but that was when we were in solo play no hard feelings I hope.  I'm not holding a grudge for the flaming oil tanker crashing on me after all
2552 2018-07-10 18:42:03 How's your ankle doing?
2553 2018-07-10 18:41:56 Yesterday I burnt myself with boiling hot oil, then was kept up all night my the gull colony that lives in my roof, then today I had a panic attack which resulted in a nose bleed. I am done. I don’t want life anymore... literally done.

2558 2018-07-10 18:41:31 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2559 2018-07-10 18:41:23 I don't think anybody has an appetite for $150 oil today. Not even the producers would want it.

2561 2018-07-10 18:41:18 You are sadly mythtaken. Delusional even. Even if you are a paid troll of an oil cartel.
2562 2018-07-10 18:41:08 Well 'Murica did defeat Poland is the Revolutionary War of 1812..you know...the War to End all Wars which got us out of Vietnam in the 80s. Need to see American hot dogs flavored with oil and coal!!

2566 2018-07-10 18:41:02 Confluence of better computer technology to predict average occupancy and oil going from under $20 to over $100/barrel.
2567 2018-07-10 18:41:00 I should think OPEC hates the idea of climate change. We are moving to a time when oil ceases to be important
2568 2018-07-10 18:40:43 took my car in for an oil change and after they finished, an employee brought my car around and my phone connected to the bluetooth. the guy walks inside and goes “i like The Greatest Showman too. good choice of tunes”

2576 2018-07-10 18:39:33 There is no movement of goal posts Obama has 0 real (not fake) scandals. Trump has numerous. He is not fit to be president and if Congress wasn’t basically a spineless collection of old white men owned by big pharma, big oil, and defense contractors he would be impeached by now.
2577 2018-07-10 18:39:30 Are we again going to give away our LNG to drastically increase Albertans costs for something that is right under our feet. Previous Ab government did this with oil and now we are getting screwed by foreign owned rich bxtch oil companies!!!!!

would be HILLARY-OUS
2584 2018-07-10 18:38:36 So far he’s prevented war, not invaded another country for oil and yet the economy is on the up and unemployment is down. He’s preventing illegal immigration (the law being broken) and ensuring the safety of his citizens on US soil... all good so far!

2595 2018-07-10 18:36:13 Oil rigs may end their days as valuable artificial reefs.

2597 2018-07-10 18:36:02 Listening to @LindseyGrahamSC talk reminds me of every snake oil salesman to ever wander the Old West. His voice drips poison, just like Joel Osteen's.
2598 2018-07-10 18:35:56 Awesome! Will do. I just bought a bottle of oil but I'll be tinkering around with other companies. I'm looking forward to trying to gel melt from you next among some other things.

2603 2018-07-10 18:34:59 We’ll have a ward each with all the oil money we have.
2604 2018-07-10 18:34:58 Nobody’s “grasping at straws”. We are synthesizing the pieces of a very large and complex conspiracy that in the end has simple objectives. Putin wants oil & gas sanctions lifted on his cash poor country, & for us to look the other way on his annexation of Crimea (for oil & gas)

2614 2018-07-10 18:34:01 I take fish oil to keep the hair looking nice
2615 2018-07-10 18:33:55 The government outlawing CBD oil is the stupidest shit I have ever heard!
2616 2018-07-10 18:33:47 Butterball: you conjure a boiling barrel of oil and turkey parts and hurl it at your enemies, which shatters on impact.
2617 2018-07-10 18:33:47 Oil and Gas industry is captivated by Canadian politicians!! Insane!!
2618 2018-07-10 18:33:44 Funny thing is, it would be such a minor inconvenience and in all honesty, would likely be no longer than a typical rain delay but with the roof that is no longer a thing.
2619 2018-07-10 18:33:16 I need somebody in Austin to teach me how to change my oil and change a tire (its been a while) lol
2620 2018-07-10 18:33:13 Have you tried CBD oil.for pets? Might help.
2621 2018-07-10 18:33:03 oil changes should be like, $2.
2622 2018-07-10 18:32:56 The only things "proven" are what an 8th headset could look up on Google in a half hour...

The CP stuff is comical... THINK about it... they were going to GIVE CP 20% of the Russian national oil company?... exactly HOW stupid are you to not get a good snort from that one?
2623 2018-07-10 18:32:50 Germany want to buy oil and gas from Russia while saying they should not be in G7/8. They have major investments in Iran as well, yet we are still footing the bill to defend them because they were resposible for not 1 but 2 world wars. Get us out of Germany.
2624 2018-07-10 18:32:47 I had a stomach ache during the con :( Try peppermint essential oil!
2625 2018-07-10 18:32:40 France pressing so hard
2626 2018-07-10 18:32:40 It absolutely gives it an edge!  I have apparently blocked out any of our prom themes.  I can't remember a single one.  I think we used "The Forgotten Years" by Midnight oil as our senior class theme...
2627 2018-07-10 18:32:33 While I value drawing dinosaurs with crayons it's easy to say that it can't be compared with an oil painting made with care and an artistic intention. I'd say it might explain what people mean with BTS's rap being better than others
2628 2018-07-10 18:32:27 Name one (1.) Country, which has asked for Military assistance from the U.S., since the inception of NATO, now, please, relate the Country's, who has supported the U.S., in Wars, and/or squeamish's, over Oil or our best regional interests???

Ranking #Iran/ian Diplo in Delhi threatens India "if you replace our oil with US, Saudi or Russia/n oil, we cease special concessions we made for you."
Seemingly they sell cheap oil to India
India is 2nd largest Iran oil buyer
2632 2018-07-10 18:31:40 I saw oil. I had higher level clearance then some. But it was a scam in states/areas that were not affected. I also did wildlife rescue the first few weeks. It was horrifying.
2633 2018-07-10 18:31:37 Son this lady just came into my job and told me her hair dresser told her she could use cooking oil in her hair 
2634 2018-07-10 18:31:34 @realDonaldTrump The oil market is not optimistic, exempting some countries is just an absurd claim that will never be realized. We now receive news that I'm sure the oil boycott will reach zero by November.
2635 2018-07-10 18:31:22 Beard. Oil.
2636 2018-07-10 18:31:19 McDavid should be on the ice for the full PP every God damn time. There's no reason for the oil not to have a great PP
2637 2018-07-10 18:31:15 i am struck by the potential for a Trump/Putin quid pro quo over oil px vs US pullback in Syria or other similar geopolitical concession
2638 2018-07-10 18:31:04 Job 29:5-6 When the Almighty was yet with me, When my children were around me; When my steps were bathed with cream, And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me!
2639 2018-07-10 18:31:04 Joe argued that high oil prices and high soybean prices are best for ND.
I would say that depends. Soybean farmers use a lot of diesel, so lower oil prices are good for them, for example. And all commodity prices are cyclical.
2640 2018-07-10 18:31:02 Hard not to be impressed with what we have seen from #BEL through the opening 30... #WorldCup
2641 2018-07-10 18:31:02 Don’t count on Canadian oil for much longer. And even worse, don’t count on Canadian crops or fresh water either.
2642 2018-07-10 18:31:01 Today was going great until I burnt my hand in hot oil
2643 2018-07-10 18:30:42 yep no doubt, I can see the stereotypical uppity snobs at a board meeting talking about this commoner's championship game on at the same time as theirs.  Why I never!
2644 2018-07-10 18:30:40 Not sure, maybe check reviews!! Coconut oil would probably work, fixes everything
2645 2018-07-10 18:30:39 does every girl get anxiety when they go to get their oil changed bc they tell u to do so many different things? or is it just me?

2651 2018-07-10 18:30:03 Drink coconut oil 5gms in the morning and 5gms in the evening. You will see the results.
2652 2018-07-10 18:29:57 Getting paid to sit here while my oil is being changed on my work car#winning
2653 2018-07-10 18:29:24 If crude oil surges past $ 85, Asian Paints will test 900/- levels. Be realistic pls!
2654 2018-07-10 18:29:16 Trim your nails often! And if you have bio oil or something similar rub that on them  
2655 2018-07-10 18:28:58 California has a big ego because of it's tech. Last I checked, nobody started endless wars over computer chip materials... but lots of wars go on over oil.. and Texas has a supply so large they don't have the infrastructure to move it, but what happens when they suddenly do?
2656 2018-07-10 18:28:40 I'm with you and agree, if it does happen, it'll be courtesy the influence of one Royal Family and not out of the goodness of those running the All England Club ;)
2657 2018-07-10 18:28:37 Waiting for the coconut oil to absorb on my back before I flip over and apply to my front. Then it’s pool time again! Hurry up.
2658 2018-07-10 18:28:35 Hahahahaha you space cadets!! Why don't you discuss it with Canada's new biggest oil baron @RachelNotley #TransMountain

2661 2018-07-10 18:28:22 Bout that time for my car to get a oil change and its hot af out here
2662 2018-07-10 18:28:07 Mas por que
2663 2018-07-10 18:27:53 Vinegar and a little olive oil. Stinks for a minute but worth it

2665 2018-07-10 18:27:38 That’s reasonable. Lmk I bought grape seed oil in bulk at World Market.
2666 2018-07-10 18:27:33 Sorry! That’s the jalapeño oil on my fingers.
2667 2018-07-10 18:27:24 The coconut oil I use as cleanser has completely desolidified. #warmout
2668 2018-07-10 18:27:23 This going be like my 5th time going to the oil change place  its always too busy so i leave 
2669 2018-07-10 18:27:06 I ate a bottle of fish oil once. I grew gills
2670 2018-07-10 18:26:57 Oil is not a sustainable business model. Look at Venezuela.
2671 2018-07-10 18:26:50 Yes. Hep A-C: for your convenience.
2672 2018-07-10 18:26:49 Just hope that everytime my energy level for burning midnight oil can be same like tonight

2677 2018-07-10 18:26:15 I know the difference and it’s true, but there will still be oil (so I’ve been told) at least. And yeah they’re trying to control it because the will of the people is recreational and people expected to abuse the medical passing.
2678 2018-07-10 18:26:08 You’ve lost me?! Surely only materially increased OPEC (& affiliates) supply would dent oil px?
2679 2018-07-10 18:25:57 Who’s trying to pay for my oil change ?
2680 2018-07-10 18:25:57 The resources aren't yours.  See, Menem signed an agreement to share the oil revenues, but Kirchner tore it up, apparently preferring all of nothing rather than some of something.
2681 2018-07-10 18:25:54 The oil won’t stop flowing until they’re full.
2682 2018-07-10 18:25:42 Fake news: The SCOTUS Grand Marshall has already ordered that the kids be put back into the cave until only 1 remains.
2683 2018-07-10 18:25:41 But Paul Joseph Watson is a snake oil merchant...
2684 2018-07-10 18:25:37 So I’m at Meijer and some old lady asks me if I work there? I’m wearing a black t shirt, grease and oil stained jeans and cowboy work boots. No? Do I look like I work here?
2685 2018-07-10 18:25:16 Try oil prior to wars .. Bush's are known very well with the Saudis
2686 2018-07-10 18:25:13 i rubbed some peppermint oil into my temples before taking a nap to soothe my murderous headache but i think i might've rubbed some into my eye area while i was asleep because my eyes are burning while also feeling oddly refreshed now
2687 2018-07-10 18:25:04 #Mexico's president-elect wants to end all fuel imports during his term. #Gasoline production in #Mexico dropped by 50% since 2013 when the constitutional energy overhaul ended #Pemex's monopoly & allowed international oil distributors to intervene #GlobalKnowledge #GlobalTrade
2688 2018-07-10 18:24:56 Also the bit of him having a glass of oil disguised in a period wine goblet is SO Doctor Who it kills me.
2689 2018-07-10 18:24:45 See how expensive American foreign policy will be then.

Trump will have to pay for US wars over oil without European support.
2690 2018-07-10 18:24:37 Got a great training today from a very knowledgeable RN.. who also managed to mention their love of homeopathic coconut oil and ACV, their self-diagnosed OCD bc they "don't like things on the floor", and they were, OF COURSE, terrified of vaccines and GMOs. Ugh I'm boiling over
2691 2018-07-10 18:23:52 yeah it gets suuuper oily otherwise, it’s rly hard to even describe how bad it is tbh. one time i didn’t wash for 2 days and my hair was like soaked in oil
2692 2018-07-10 18:23:48 Got to love that deep-cleansing action from the kaolin clay and peppermint oil!  How did the ground aduki beans feel against your skin?
2693 2018-07-10 18:23:39 This is a false competition- no allowance for sugar level, no choice of cocoa bean - no allowance to exclude palm oil or harmful fats
2694 2018-07-10 18:23:33 Oil and gas producers on federal lands lost 25.4 billion cubic feet of gas in 2016, paying royalties on just 16 percent of that gas. Taxpayers are losing out on $millions in royalties.
2695 2018-07-10 18:23:18 so first off i want to tell you the products that i use currently.
i currently use:
-devacurl no poo original and one condition original.
-shea moisture jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner.
2696 2018-07-10 18:23:15 His behavior drastically improves with high-protein, but the only way he gets enough calories is with liberal addition of oil to everything.

2699 2018-07-10 18:22:47 Happy #710. May your day be filled with oil. #StonerFam
2700 2018-07-10 18:22:27 We can play hypotheticals but you clearly have one in mind that caused you to say that we won't abandon oil as a power supply until we have a civil war or peaceful secession.
2701 2018-07-10 18:22:26 Yeah, not so pleasant, specially doing most of it myself in a car .. that is now apparently burning or leaking oil. Fml. Plan is to get a dishwasher for the second pipe spot, but money ;)
2702 2018-07-10 18:22:26 I poured the oil...slowly filling the engine. Her finger found her exposed laps and played absent minded on it. She said "u r smooth"
2703 2018-07-10 18:21:57 Do you have flour, sugar, baking soda, vanilla, butter or oil? Mug cakes are delicious.
2704 2018-07-10 18:21:53 Hello my cat was diagnosed with feline leukemia can I give him CPB OIL it will help him in any way ?
2705 2018-07-10 18:21:22 @realDonaldTrump sir may I request you to share what incentives your govt. may offer if #India @PMOIndia bring down/ completely shut import of #Iranian Crude Oil.
Wouldn't it be fair @SecretaryRoss that #USA bring down import duties for #madeinindia goods down by 75% fr all goods
2706 2018-07-10 18:21:09 Until it realizes that you can't play nice with the rest of the civilized world and continue down such an archaic, outmoded way to profit. They'll go the same way the Saudis expect to in a couple decades once the oil runs out and the rest of the world has moved on.
2707 2018-07-10 18:21:07 AND YOU NEED LOTUS OIL FOR HAIR AND GOOD FOOD AND GOOD CLOTH AND WE PRODUCE JUST FOR OWN AND AFRICA KNOWS RESPECT AGAIN AND THEY DEVELOP NOW IN OWN CULTURE AND MEHMET EFENDI IS RIGHT AND WE NEED MORE GOOD FOOD ON OWN AND I ALREADY DID THIS IN MISRAF KITAP AND TURKS MUST PRODUCE
2708 2018-07-10 18:21:04 Insightful journalism on Channel 5 programme oh Westminster Abbey and the Coronation; ‘there’s the Holy Oil and that’s rather stinky’. #trite #shite
2709 2018-07-10 18:20:59 Yeah I do the same.. Part of me won't give In and the other part is tired and In pain.. Heat pads.. Magnesium supplements and creams.. Some swear by cbd oil but it tastes foul and is expensive
2710 2018-07-10 18:20:56 We always hear.  Social Security is running out of money but you never hear; Welfare is running out of money.  Why are the working class always penalized for doing the right thing? Btw. You looked like an idiot with all the other idiots last night. #WalkAway #VoteDemsOut
2711 2018-07-10 18:20:48 I would be happy to present our international experience of the practical application of #Digitaloilfield #Integratedoperations #AI #IoT #Collaboration in oil and gas and mining in exchange for a place at the conference.. Thanks
2712 2018-07-10 18:20:30 I always feel the need to tweet when I’m waiting for my car’s oil change to be done.
2713 2018-07-10 18:20:30 Got my oil changed and asked the guy how much it would cost to get my air fixed and he said “$1,600” ... you’ll catch me dead on the side of the highway before you catch me w air conditioning in my car
2714 2018-07-10 18:19:57 not sure if you’ve already tried this but castor oil is helpful!!
2715 2018-07-10 18:19:56 Pretty harsh take about a guy who is revered among his peers as one of the truly great entrepreneurs of his time. Has been taking on big auto and oil to popularize electric cars for years and has forced the entire auto industry to change their strategies to push this vision ahead
2716 2018-07-10 18:19:43 @mmckinnon ALASKA. That’s what Putin is after. Blackest water where money oil is in the trillions. 

@JillWineBanks follow the money. Ignore the man in front of the curtain. He’s a puppet

2721 2018-07-10 18:19:15 Hi John. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
2722 2018-07-10 18:19:12 Eggs and oil pretty much sums up mayo. I thought vegans were supposed to be the smart kids?
2723 2018-07-10 18:19:11 Make Mexico pay 20k for each felon returned...paid from oil pipeline...Nustar LP put that towards The Wall ....Mexico will step up Border control in a heartbeat....NEXT!!!!...lol
2724 2018-07-10 18:19:05 I mean we can play hypotheticals all day. But if there is a war it won’t end in unity. A southern federation whom already controls most American oil would continue down its same path and be able to stimulate its own economy.
2725 2018-07-10 18:19:02 First day of training in work and I come home as slick rick with all that oil in ma hair and face

2728 2018-07-10 18:18:59 Don’t know if it’s just the massaging and keeping your skin hydrated mind, but deffo wasn’t getting the same results from bio oil and that costs loads
2729 2018-07-10 18:18:50 THEY ALWAYS PUT SOMETHING, SOMETHING STRANGE AND WHEN YOU EAT IT, IT TASTE SO BITTER. AND GOD THE OIL, ITS LIKE THEY ADD 1 LITER OF OIL IN IT

2732 2018-07-10 18:18:41  Getting my car cleaned. Fianna go to the dealership. Oil change & tints.
2733 2018-07-10 18:18:40 Wreckage and oil. You might also hear the sounds of the sub breaking up on hydrophones, but after a barrage of depth charges, not likely.
2734 2018-07-10 18:18:31 Cheers mate, sorry for unwarranted insults. I do truly believe if you go on a learning quest in climate change you will feel differently on oil pipelines.
2735 2018-07-10 18:18:29 Oil money
2736 2018-07-10 18:18:25 I just realized for the first time that 7/10 is OIL upside down and a tear rolled down my cheek
2737 2018-07-10 18:18:25 You've probably heard of 4/20 but do you know about 7/10? 710 is OIL spelled upside down, So we are celebrating Cannabis Concentrates #deals
2738 2018-07-10 18:18:14 Exxon Mobil must be chomping at the bit with Trump meeting Putin.  They can't wait to get to the mother load of oil which was prevented due to sanctions, which are about to be lifted.  By the way, this will make Trump a very rich man and Putin even richer.
2739 2018-07-10 18:18:06 They maybe swayed by more influential people like politicians, Prince William, etc.  It would be doubtful that England will be in this position again and really a one off.  I love The Championships but football will always be bigger than tennis.
2740 2018-07-10 18:17:44 The BP oil spill was the biggest scam Ive ever seen. Signed, cleanup worker who never saw a drop of oil but was pushed through the 40hr hazwopper class 4 times. Also never met anyone who has seen any oil despite having dozens of friends who also tried to work in the cleanup.

2745 2018-07-10 18:17:18 We’re all now waiting to see,who will be the Black Swan scape goat to blame the Economic Meltdown Which is mathematically inevitable without Central Banks printing more debt.Options we have now are,oil at 150usd/barrel,Turkey Collapse,Italy’s Banks Insolvent,DeutscheBank Collapse
2746 2018-07-10 18:17:08 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for pink clay mud masks, and put some grapefruit essential oil in my diffuser.

2748 2018-07-10 18:16:52 For my birthday Austin is cleaning my car (inside and out), changing my oil and putting new windshield wipers on my car. So glad I don’t have to do any of this myself 
2749 2018-07-10 18:16:25 The oil skin is not smeared onto the skin of strangers
2750 2018-07-10 18:16:22 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

2752 2018-07-10 18:16:16 So, once the north reconquers the south and forces them to stop using oil, we'll stop using oil? Or when THE SOUTH RISES AGAIN (banjo lick here) they'll decide that with the libs owned, they can finally stop using oil?
2753 2018-07-10 18:16:14 I can't believe that when I'd have kids. I'd be telling them that Nigeria USED to have oil money. That's insane
2754 2018-07-10 18:16:14 「なんか臭い臭いがするんだけどよくよく嗅ぐと臭いといより良い匂いがしなくもないいやこの匂いは臭いか臭いタイプの臭いなのかそれとも臭くない匂いなのか」
2755 2018-07-10 18:16:12 wow.......what a view and imagination brought to the canvas through his oil paintings...great work by Frank Carmichael........thanx for sharing this beautiful piece.......cheers
2756 2018-07-10 18:16:01 Ive decided 2 things.1. Trump is ABSOLUTELY aligned with Putin (probably a combination of kompromat & promises of oil $$)2. He'll try to cover that with semi-plausible explanations for why he's doing various things including saying Trade War & leaving NATO (he'll  try)are about $
2757 2018-07-10 18:15:56 Your on the highest strength antibiotics for tooth abscess but  they can take 48 hrs to get in system . If you can get to a chemist today paramol will help you sleep tonight ( that’s from experience ) clove oil can irritate so take with caution .
2758 2018-07-10 18:15:55 How do you know it's snake oil? Tried it? Nope you haven't no review just slander
2759 2018-07-10 18:15:51 #WTI at $73.97 (+0.16%), #Brent $78.74 (+0.86%) - no major breakout moves for both #oil benchmarks today either, all within range #OOTT #oilandgas
2760 2018-07-10 18:15:49 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2761 2018-07-10 18:15:44 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2762 2018-07-10 18:15:35 The folks over at the All England Club have already said no chance, which is not surprising. With that said, if England does win, the cry from the masses may have them consider it but can't see it ;)
2763 2018-07-10 18:15:34 Ocean and oil
2764 2018-07-10 18:15:30 You can not fool me, I bet you car runs on human fat and oil of nerves.
2765 2018-07-10 18:15:27 Well, the Ghia made it from Conwy to Hull, even if it took two litres of oil and one near-overheat. Sump is dribbling like an old man. Tomorrow, Amsterdam.
2766 2018-07-10 18:15:25 Legit a crime to have to put on clothes after a sugar scrub and an oil down 
2767 2018-07-10 18:15:22 Sounds like snake oil to me. There is to my knowledge no way for a passive observer to be reliably differentiate between active and passive mobile phone use. And dangerous activities like texting uses no data at all while typing.

2771 2018-07-10 18:15:14 Breaking news: Donald Trump, Jr. allowed oil drilling in Jake Tapper while you were distracted by Trump's tweets.
2772 2018-07-10 18:15:04 If only @realDonaldTrump read the @EIAgov STEO.

There is clearly no worries over an oil price spike as EIA's STEO shows a material storage build for 2019. 

But close followers will note that EIA's STEO storage forecast is perhaps the worst forecast out there.

2773 2018-07-10 18:14:53 Aku pun paling benci buang mascara. Sental kuat, rasa macam botak dah bulu mata. Pakai oil based remover, mata pedih masuk minyak. #girlsissue
2774 2018-07-10 18:14:52 Bout time.  Better late than never. Just stopped by McDonald's&talked to the manager who watched me put Himalayan salt in my water. She was aware of KC and Keto diet. I told her to look up seed oils. She had heard that canola oil was healthy. I mentioned fruit oils&beef tallow
2775 2018-07-10 18:14:49 NATO as an encirclement of Russia and the Russo-Shia bloc: funny coming from major Russian trading partners and Gazprom clients like Germany, and Iranian oil users like France!
2776 2018-07-10 18:14:44 I dropped my car off at 10am for an 11am appt for a oil change, it’s now 2pm I came back thinking it’d be ready and they’re telling me my cars just going in now and it’ll be 30. @HuntingtonHonda why did I even bother making an appt? I’m very annoyed and late to work now
2777 2018-07-10 18:14:41 TRY COCONUT OIL AND SUGAR   AS A SCRUB . SCRUB IT ON IN THE SHOWER AND AFTER BATHING WASH IF OFF AND YOU’LL TASTE SWEET
2778 2018-07-10 18:14:25 Castor and coconut oil work miracles sis!!
2779 2018-07-10 18:14:23 Lots and lots of apple cider vinegar/lemon water and @BahiCosmetics Sunflower Sweets Serum! Also rosehip oil before bed, and vitamin e gel
2780 2018-07-10 18:14:05 Working at a long legged Dali Creature, I cry for help and observe an oil rig howl on the other side of town
2781 2018-07-10 18:14:01 Do u believe a petrol bunk guy own a textile,, do u believe a textile guy own a oil,, do u believe oil guy own a retail,, do u believe retail guy own telecom,, do u believe telecom guy making a dish TV,, its not what ur doing before,, it's the money and mind doing so
2782 2018-07-10 18:13:54 "The phoniest and craziest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2783 2018-07-10 18:13:41 Question is do YOU know what it is?
How can one call themselves a Christian but support a President who freely gropes women, encarcerates children, cheats on his wife and doesn't believe in religion?
You call this #MAGA You've been duped for vote for a snake oil salesman.
2784 2018-07-10 18:13:21 Kate is a  proofreader that likes Sesame oil on their mushroom pizza with liquor
2785 2018-07-10 18:13:10 @Tesco All your bread has palm oil in it... Haven't bought any from you for over a year... SORT IT OUT!
2786 2018-07-10 18:13:07 Ill take humidity over heat anyday! Fuck this dry ass sun right now. I gotta bathe in baby oil n moisturizer just so my skin won’t dehydrate n crack 
2787 2018-07-10 18:13:06 Think turbine guys made millions off Ontario taxpayers backs they can pack up and take the snake oil somewhere else
2788 2018-07-10 18:12:44 Happy #710 Everyone
International Oil day
#SmokeUpOil #iNeedWax
2789 2018-07-10 18:12:31 That oil poured is like tomato sauce poured Sausage @Britney_Amber @Brazzers
2790 2018-07-10 18:12:17 @katharinemcphee you're sexy & talented but you better drink alkaline water, use black seed oil, etc. Davey doesn't do certain parts of the vows; sickness, worse, til death & forsaking all others 
2791 2018-07-10 18:12:14 I had a burn on my face that disappeared with daily use of sweet almond oil (and now cold pressed rosehip oil). I am now applying sweet almond oil to a deep scar I have on my calf from last summer and it seems to be getting better.
2792 2018-07-10 18:12:10 About a billion of them will join the middle class in the next 10 years. And energy demand explodes as a luxury once achieved become a necessity. (Oh, and oil fields deplete inexorably.)
2793 2018-07-10 18:11:59 that’s how it goes!!!! my kingdom for a drop of fish oil
2794 2018-07-10 18:11:54 Putting out oil fires in a desert 
2795 2018-07-10 18:11:51 「におい」と「くさい」に同じ「臭い」って漢字当てはめたの誰やねん使いづらすぎるやろボコすぞ
2796 2018-07-10 18:11:51 Happy oil day friends
2797 2018-07-10 18:11:38 costco's got my big ass tub of coconut oil for the low tho, so I'm loyal 
2798 2018-07-10 18:11:36 Im picturing you wringing out a fish and it bestowing you with a drop of its oil
2799 2018-07-10 18:11:34 เท่าไรบอกเลยครับ
2800 2018-07-10 18:11:32 So you don’t know the difference between drilling and pumping oil, vs digging millions of tons of tar sands for hauling to upgraders and creating thousands of acres of tar ponds that will never, ever, be properly remediated. Do you?!? #cdnpoli #tarsands
2801 2018-07-10 18:11:30 Try a peppermint oil spray.
2802 2018-07-10 18:11:03 The civil war is going to cause us to break away from oil?
2803 2018-07-10 18:10:57 Advertisement is released in newspapers by Oil Marketing Companies for new distributorships from time to time based on industry requirement. Eligible candidates can apply for the same & selection will be as per process listed therein. Present selection guideline1/2
2804 2018-07-10 18:10:52 sighhhhhhhhhhhhh. LOL. I'll be calling soon to get an oil change anyway. 
2805 2018-07-10 18:10:50 Because they don't know any better. How would you react if you said to a mechanic 'I think it's an oil leak' and he replied 'No s*** Sherlock.' You're trying to defend indefensible behaviour towards a customer.
2806 2018-07-10 18:10:36 Depends on how much oil was added.  But they would have to PROVE she added oil.  The car should be still under warranty since it's a 2017.
2807 2018-07-10 18:10:30 確かに研究室も臭いんよなエアコンからカビそのものの臭いがする。
2808 2018-07-10 18:10:26 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
2809 2018-07-10 18:10:21 I was using CBD regularly which helped but is SO dang EXPENSIVE! So I had to cut it WAY back or we wouldn’t be able to buy food. I used voltaren & lidocaine gels also which my ins covers the voltaren.  
I DO plan to buy some CBD topical oil next chance I get money wise
2810 2018-07-10 18:10:18 Ahahaha just like Ina Garten.   And yes, you're right... The prices get me sometimes too. Those meal kits are helpful in that they only send what you need so you're not wasting a whole bottle of like, sesame oil cos you only use it once
2811 2018-07-10 18:10:12 Truuu Lewis needs to be drowned in cooking oil
2812 2018-07-10 18:10:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
2813 2018-07-10 18:10:06 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2814 2018-07-10 18:10:05 Today feels a "stay in side, cuddle up on the couch, and solve the oil crisis" kind of day.
2815 2018-07-10 18:10:00 Beware of snake oil. It'll kill you at some point.
2816 2018-07-10 18:09:57 If England end up in the final I wonder if they will move the time.
2817 2018-07-10 18:09:57 I also put a little bit of oil and devacurl gel (dime size) if I’ll be outside and my hair maintains through the humidity, with little to no frizz
2818 2018-07-10 18:09:50 if you there when she get out the shower tonight, get that coco oil and rub the fuck out her feet/ankles
2819 2018-07-10 18:09:50 Just another day in the oil biz...
2820 2018-07-10 18:09:46 All the guys in the PNW smell like beard oil tho
2821 2018-07-10 18:09:43 @BrittonBuchanan  Two separate shows in NC now.  So I guess I'll be making road trips down south in both July and August.  Better change the oil in the SUV!     
2822 2018-07-10 18:09:42 Sending you guys all the good juju  get her on some CBD oil, it’s been known to reduce growth of cancerous cells while protecting healthy ones
2823 2018-07-10 18:09:41 I bought avocado and coconut oil for my hair. Im still frizzy. Maybe i didnt use enough- maybe it's my dead ends
2824 2018-07-10 18:09:28 Are you must pour oil on their hinges; but you look sharp after her.
2825 2018-07-10 18:09:21 寝る
2826 2018-07-10 18:09:16 Pork/beef patty, breaded in finely-ground peanuts, egg, and cornmeal. Deep-fried in peanut oil. Topped with a fried egg. Drizzle over a chocolate habanero hot sauce. Between a bread of your choosing. Maybe add some cheese for the pull-apart goodness. #babishpanini #notachef
2827 2018-07-10 18:09:09 Yay more money for subsidizing big oil
2828 2018-07-10 18:09:03 fish oil is the god of destroying my depression
2829 2018-07-10 18:09:03 950ｍ降りが最近流行ってるのかな？らしいから取り敢えず習得。前まで途中までしか下に向けなかったのがいけなかったのね。
2830 2018-07-10 18:09:02 When your basil plant is out of leaves, our BASIL INFUSED OLIVE OIL has your back. Imbue your marinated meats with herb-y flavor, and knock the socks off your sauteed vegetables. #basil #oliveoil #infusedoilsandvinegars #basilinfused #oil
2831 2018-07-10 18:08:56 Sears just sent me a oil change coupon after that tweet lol. It’s lit 
2832 2018-07-10 18:08:52 何でや！理系話したいだけやん！
2833 2018-07-10 18:08:44 Venezuela is because of oil embargos - they're primary export is oil.  The oil boom from 2004-2015 kept their economy going.  There was also mass corruption in their government which contributed to nationalizing entire public sectors.
2834 2018-07-10 18:08:26 Today I learned do Not get your oil changed on low battery and an empty stomach
2835 2018-07-10 18:08:18 Can't remember the last time I haven't watched the Men's #Wimbledon Final live but will have no choice but to do so on Sunday. No question we will get #WorldCup updates during the tennis telecast but don't see the opposite occurring.
2836 2018-07-10 18:08:08  I just need an oil change but I know this tire pressure light bet not be about shit. I hope it’s nothing serious for u!
2837 2018-07-10 18:07:46 Yes but Man City can quite comfortably sit there and bump the price up with their oil well..!
2838 2018-07-10 18:07:40 Lá é plano é o sistema de vídeo precário.. fui no Springsteen quase na grade da Premium e no Midnight Oil na pista atrás bem atrás.
2839 2018-07-10 18:07:37 710 is OIL upside down. just in case you didn’t know, now you do.
2840 2018-07-10 18:07:34 But as for options to take care of them, I tend to use essential oils to keep Pests away (mainly peppermint oil and water for spiders) but I know of others for other bugs too.. this way it won’t be harmful ><‘ (but no peppermint oil in this case bc of kitties)
2841 2018-07-10 18:07:29 this probably sounds gross but i like cheerios with one table spoon of fish oil... 
lmao this is probably gross with normal fish oil but the fish oil in iceland is not that bad lol

@VanessaMerrell @veronicamerrell @MerrellTwins i dare you to try this if you ever come to iceland
2842 2018-07-10 18:07:23 stop buying their palm oil
2843 2018-07-10 18:07:20 Awesome can’t wait to see their work!!
2844 2018-07-10 18:07:15 this man smells like fried oil..
2845 2018-07-10 18:06:51 it seems like an awful lot of hard work limes  garlic smells etc., a mcdonalds would be handier what's sesame oil when its at home you must be loaded
2846 2018-07-10 18:06:39 @ZimEye Nada.This is cheap politicking.Water and oil can't mix.Soberminded people  can't be shaken by such falsehoods and propaganda.
2847 2018-07-10 18:06:38 Cooler full of munchies, tanning oil, and some pals
2848 2018-07-10 18:06:26 you need oil to combat oil. so bila apply oil kat oily skin, skin kita akan reduce sebum production tuu sebab dia macam dah detect “weh dah banyak oil ni, jom kurangkan” gicheww
2849 2018-07-10 18:06:20 Coconut oil 
2850 2018-07-10 18:06:00 Find some ducks, oil, and a camera
2851 2018-07-10 18:05:52 Make lasagna using slices of courgette rather than pasta, it’s so much lighter. Courgette, prawns, chili flakes and lemon with olive oil and spaghetti is also good. I’m def a savoury person 
2852 2018-07-10 18:05:40 Have you looked in the mirror lately Dinesh??? You're no oil painting mate
2853 2018-07-10 18:05:23 Dear Uber drivers,                                 Kindly fill up your oil tanks before pick up.                                                   Anonymous x
2854 2018-07-10 18:05:11 OK, I get it. Local regulations keep California's water vaguely somewhat clean and its coastline only mildly fucked, but that's not what people are talking about here. Their point is that extensive use of oil is going to cause climate change, but ALSO that war for oil is bad
2855 2018-07-10 18:05:02 Casually watching Maury while getting my oil changed...guy next to me leans over “boy you could put a saddle on her ass and rider...cuz she looks like a horse” #Nice
2856 2018-07-10 18:04:50 Hey there. Agave Dijon, Balsamic Vinegar, Red Wine Vinegar, Spicy Avocado, Spicy Buffalo, and Olive Oil are all soy-free options for you!
2857 2018-07-10 18:04:46 “Oil me up daddy”
2858 2018-07-10 18:04:45 Good news: kids did not flood the kitchen.

Bad news: they spilled half a jug of olive oil.
2859 2018-07-10 18:04:44 And during the big, shirtless, so-freakin-much-baby-oil fight when the dove flies up in slow motion — I fell off the couch. 
2860 2018-07-10 18:04:34 When i cash out for tuition and oil change/head lights  #adulting
2861 2018-07-10 18:04:28 No no no not at all!! I'm saying television makeup is not everyday or "club hosting" makeup. HD cameras (and even regular cameras) pick up everything. Chunky glitter looks good in the chair but under lights and on stage the chunks look like bad skin and the shine looks like oil.
2862 2018-07-10 18:04:25 "Bijna een week" lijkt me niet zo'n bezwaar. Zo hebben we ook andere onjuistheden in de docu besproken:

- abiogenic oil;
- Thomas Gold;
- schaarste aardolie kan mogelijk klimaatverandering verergeren;
etc.

Er wordt wel 's over minder belangwekkende zaken getwiitterd. 
2863 2018-07-10 18:04:24 I found a giant dead spider in my oil diffuser on my desk and then found out my co-worker brought snakes to work today so how's YOUR Tuesday??
2864 2018-07-10 18:03:45 Oil Giroud to do the business
2865 2018-07-10 18:03:39 I use a whipped olive oil and cocoa butter leave in conditioner myself. It has a pleasant scent
2866 2018-07-10 18:03:23 This made me want the bread and oil from not your average joes sooo bad
2867 2018-07-10 18:03:05 Tomorrow is 7-11! 
Happy Treated water, high fructose corn syrup, orange juice from concentrated, natural flavors, citric acid, quillaia extract, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, erythorbic acid, calcium sodium edta,Yellow 5, gum arabic, brominated vegetable oil. DAY!!
2868 2018-07-10 18:03:02 Dim view? He's fighting Koch brothers & Big Oil who all have way more money than him. He literally created the EV market and fighting climate change.
2869 2018-07-10 18:02:57 How much have we helped EU with the refugee problem EU spending millions while we refuse to take in our share. The refugees are bc we invaded & tried to take their oil. Not just with Iraq, but all of the invasions to change governments, throughout Middle East for US gain.  So sad
2870 2018-07-10 18:02:52 Baby oil and vodka!! 
2871 2018-07-10 18:02:50 Are you about to insinuate that oil isn’t the backbone of American currency?
2872 2018-07-10 18:02:43 Will the USA stop invading countries for no reason other than oil?
2873 2018-07-10 18:02:39 Global warming is just one of the effects of climate change. There’s no vast conspiracy between scientists, NASA, NOAA, DoD, 195 countries and big oil. It’s real.
2874 2018-07-10 18:02:37 My brother can't get over the smell of the sesame oil I used earlier.
2875 2018-07-10 18:02:27 Economic collapse is inevitable under capitalism oil or not. Better to prepare for it in a way that doesn't damage the source of all our resources.
2876 2018-07-10 18:02:25 nakakailang lagay na ako ng efficascent oil sa may left side ng tiyan ko masakit pa din tangna
2877 2018-07-10 18:02:23 But we were talking about climate change, which has nothing to do with where we actually get the oil?

I'm going to guess, being that you're in Texas and your family business got screwed over, that you got environmentally regulated out of local drilling?
2878 2018-07-10 18:02:21 世界一喉乾いた
2879 2018-07-10 18:02:04 オリンピック開催地じゃん！じゃあ今度行った時お話しよ〜
2880 2018-07-10 18:01:30 That Gemini oil ad song "sehat ki chatkar" is the most fuck all annoying noise I've ever heard.
2881 2018-07-10 18:01:24 want some oil rubbing in ? 
2882 2018-07-10 18:01:19 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
2883 2018-07-10 18:01:15 It's the little things that count like using coconut oil to rub my back when I'm dealing with weed withdrawals haha #LOVEis
2884 2018-07-10 18:01:08 Our traffic officer vehicles do carry towing equipment and its used when possible. But sometimes vehicles are so damaged that being dragged across would result in oil/debris in the road and possible road surface damage. Safer and quicker to recover from the one lane.
2885 2018-07-10 18:01:04 "Great customer service! This was my second time coming for an oil change and I will be coming back again :)" @Groupon #HappyCustomer
2886 2018-07-10 18:01:04 Are you talking about Oil futures, or the Petro dollar??
Oh yeah, I noticed the prices became volatile after 1972??
Hmmm??I wonder why that happened??
What monetary policy had recently changed??
Coincidence?

2887 2018-07-10 18:00:52 Omg I’m waiting for my oil change and I get to watch the dealer change the showroom cars. Most exciting part of my week tbh.
2888 2018-07-10 18:00:52 You live in a fantasy world. Oil is the IV to the cogs in the American machine... if oil goes away so do we. I’m talking an entire economic collapse.

2891 2018-07-10 18:00:29 Gosh, I’m so sorry to hear that. Another thing that seems to help is essential oils by doterra. If you have a diffuser you can have that in the air and lavender oil is suppose to help as well. I’ve tried that and Chinese white flower oil. It’s really cheap on eBay. I hope you (1)
2892 2018-07-10 18:00:25 Have Zinke put up oil rigs like everywhere else
2893 2018-07-10 18:00:19 You are a criminal. Iran and a terrorist organization have terrorized the Gulf states to control oil and money ...
2894 2018-07-10 18:00:15 You do realize no president ever has been as traffic on Russia in regards to sanction then this president is right now. We have destroyed their economy by providing oil to their customers. Your ration agenda does not make sense And that belief is hurting our party
2895 2018-07-10 18:00:08 Someday soon AI and robots will be able to handle most jobs people do today. We're gonna have to figure out an alternative to the dollar, to oil, to our basic economy soon whether we like it or not. And we need an alternative that will keep people happy and healthy.

2897 2018-07-10 18:00:01 I'm having ciabatta dipped in oil and balsamic like in the 90s.
2898 2018-07-10 17:59:54 残念！化学飲みでもしますか〜
2899 2018-07-10 17:59:53 ATTENTION! To everyone who uses coconut oil or any type of oil in your hair PLEASE BE AWARE that it still is an oil, with heat it boils & cooks. With this said please DO NOT USE any type of oil in your hair if you`re going out during the DAY. SPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER.
2900 2018-07-10 17:59:51 I was at autozone the other day and this chick said she only changed her oil once a year...bruh
2901 2018-07-10 17:59:41 Well that’s funny cause we’re not fucking Germany are we Matthew. No our politicians have been destabilizing nation starting wars and killing American boys for decades over oil and it needs to stop
2902 2018-07-10 17:59:23 Iran vows to sell as much oil as it can despite U.S. sanctions...
2903 2018-07-10 17:59:20 Changes in science and technology are coming quickly and we can't stop them. We CAN wean ourselves off oil and we CAN do it without hurting people's livelihoods. People just need to stop being so afraid of the change that is inevitable.
2904 2018-07-10 17:59:19 uggh... they taste like tofu and patchouli oil
2905 2018-07-10 17:59:13 Last week or so tRump was carrying on about OPEC being responsible for high oil prices, yet his Energy Information Admin is forecasting the USA to be the world's leading producer of crude, currently producing 11.76 million barrels a day..next yr forecast is 11.8 million
2906 2018-07-10 17:59:11 No, it doesn’t move the moisturizer. I also wait a few seconds or maybe a minute so that the moisturizer is a bit absorbed into my skin before I seal it with the oil
2907 2018-07-10 17:59:08 We are so beholden to the oil industry that China and others will lead the world in green energy.
2908 2018-07-10 17:59:00 Sana oil masaya 
2909 2018-07-10 17:58:56 Yea I don’t want th either but if you know anything about your government you’d know that the federal reserve is empty and the only reason the world revolves around us is because of US control of the oil industry... with out oil we sink entirely.
2910 2018-07-10 17:58:53 Drei must be the FEDS, mans just asked where’s, “the oil” on social media. 
2911 2018-07-10 17:58:50 I have owned my car for 40 days and it’s already time for an oil change. I may have a problem.
2912 2018-07-10 17:58:43 Ah.  Big oil and gas.  Enough said.
2913 2018-07-10 17:58:39 WTI: flat

2914 2018-07-10 17:58:37 Yea there’s a store on one end for oil and grease think it’s around 1600kg full from memory it’s very well built
2915 2018-07-10 17:58:34 How do panels move oil?
2916 2018-07-10 17:58:27 put too much coconut oil on and now I can’t even cross my legs without sliding 
2917 2018-07-10 17:58:17 Agree, that's why Muslims don't believe in getting rich by doing business, but by looting. That's how all Muslim invaders of India got rich and in absence of oil why pakistan is a poor country.
2918 2018-07-10 17:58:09 #WTI and #Brent #Crude were higher today as traders remain concerned about supply levels. There are supply issues in Canada and Libya, and strikes by oil and gas workers in Gambon and Norway, and this added to the upward move.
2919 2018-07-10 17:58:01 The oil change should be free since you wasted four hours of my day
2920 2018-07-10 17:57:47 #HLPF2018 #SDG NewYork, UN; Fashion is the 2nd most polluting industry (after oil) says @FFConservation as they advocate for sustainable fashion. Also huge challenges to ensure decent work in the fashion industry! @virke_no @hkinorge @Svanemerket
2921 2018-07-10 17:57:47 If you support supply management and 270% tariffs of foreign milk, I expect consistency calling for similar tariffs on foreign oil.
2922 2018-07-10 17:57:40 I'm calling BS on you. You know perfectly well the vast majority of the American left has nothing like that in mind. You're either deliberately stirring up aggression with untruths or you are suffering from a powerful self-delusion. Fox/Sinclair/Breitbart are selling snake oil
2923 2018-07-10 17:57:39 When was the last time you bought something that said made in Russia..... that should be an indicator of the type of prosperity you will get from them, the only thing you get from Russia is oil, wheat and caviar... how many ladas do you see on the street

2933 2018-07-10 17:56:01 This is crazy as hell, like, just nuts, but at least it's honestly what you believe, so that's good, I guess? Do you think that people who want more environmental regulation also want us to invade countries and take their oil? I think they want the opposite!
2934 2018-07-10 17:55:54 そのゼミおいるも参加したい！
2935 2018-07-10 17:55:48 *raises hand* in addition to eating or drinking ginger you can also use ginger essential oil to help with nausea.
2936 2018-07-10 17:55:44 Perhaps the US now realizes that it’s driving oil prices higher, which doesn’t align with Trump’s rants about lower oil and gasoline prices. Another example of not thinking through the consequences of their decisions.

2940 2018-07-10 17:55:20 Don't push yourself too hard "Oil Tot". Your making progress and someday you will be filled with a burst of energy but until then please take it easy before you fall on someone's coffee table only saying "Oops" after the incident!
2941 2018-07-10 17:55:18 Brother I woke to cream and hot water. The power went mid trim and they'd gone to get fuel I think, anyway I was gone..

I was fuming but it actually looked good . I've only just learnt about beard oil though I'm not a serious person when it comes to it..
2942 2018-07-10 17:55:08 Coconut oil..

2945 2018-07-10 17:54:44 P.S.  screw the government reports.  you think they'll be telling the people the truth of this just fine oil based pollution?  The skies are 20% more hazy overall than 50 years ago.  Capitalism and supply side economics.
2946 2018-07-10 17:54:35 The answer to war over oil isn't to drill MORE FUCKING OIL whether it's on our own coast or not
2947 2018-07-10 17:54:31 I dunno...are we giving the Iraqis back their oil?
2948 2018-07-10 17:54:30 Baby oil every time, it’s all I use on my eyes, then I let the excess sit there to soak in, I kid myself it helps with my wrinkles 
2949 2018-07-10 17:54:21 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2950 2018-07-10 17:54:18 Oklahoma... where the politicians are in bed with oil companies and the Doctor's are fucking around with the Pharmaceutical companies.  Just keep them doped up on pills and stupid. That's the plan.
2951 2018-07-10 17:54:06 Thanks. That was a tricky thing to do with this book as I had to navigate my way through chemistry, cardiology, ecology and a midlife crisis. In this case one reader under 30 is worth his/her weight in fish oil!

2954 2018-07-10 17:53:52 getting my oil changed is my least favorite thing to do Ever
2955 2018-07-10 17:53:50 Got my oil changed and turned in three applications this morning. Celebrating with @JambaJuice 
2956 2018-07-10 17:53:34 You are wrong.  

It will be a mutual suck-up event, resulting in a renewed presidential demand to lift the sanctions, so that Trump can get his share of the profits from the Rosneft oil fields.

In exchange, Putin will promise Trump a GOP landslide in November.
2957 2018-07-10 17:53:34 Crude oil or olive oil it doesn’t really effect for vote, your guys need to find a way to get vote from public
2958 2018-07-10 17:53:21 I've had my fair share of buckets so I was like IF the plugs are messed up from oil, all they need to do is either clean them or replace them! And give her an oil change too! Still...NOT $580! Am I right or wrong? Be honest! #2
2959 2018-07-10 17:53:15 Not just that.. Costco is a great place for all kinds of keto friendly goods, even hard-ish to find ones!. Coconut oil, Ghee, Avocado oil, great protein bars, nuts, Coconut/almond flour, even 100% avocado oil mayo!

Their cafeteria is just a different ball game, unfortunately.
2960 2018-07-10 17:52:55 Bless your little heart SHTF. tRump is in it to get more money for himself. He is a snake oil salesman. Still waiting to see his tax returns. What is he hiding?
2961 2018-07-10 17:52:51 Happy Birthday @DcaHomie_02 

Tell her bring the oil you have the plantain waiting on her. Lol 
2962 2018-07-10 17:52:45 Hmm. Curious as to why you think the major oil companies have acknowledged that greenhouse gases are causing global warming?
2963 2018-07-10 17:52:37 Fate decrees that the horrible burning gear oil smoke will fully envelop you. It will never wash off.
2964 2018-07-10 17:52:31 Populist more than right wing I think. Right wing sez GCC is a fiction. But yeah, the idea that we can address GCC without changes to individual behavior (incented by, e.g., carbon taxes) is nuts. “Just shut down the oil companies. Problem solved!”
2965 2018-07-10 17:52:30 Lavender oil reminds me so much of Australia
2966 2018-07-10 17:52:26 jimmy is talking to his mom about losing his oil pen in her home... i dont understand this
2967 2018-07-10 17:52:19 Between 100 and 200 cubic metres instead of 250. That’s a lot of oil however you pour it.

2984 2018-07-10 17:50:55 Crude oil prices are 2 1/2 times higher now than 20 years ago. In 20 years they'll be at least twice as high as today. This is why there's no need for a Paris agreement, the market will solve the problem.

2990 2018-07-10 17:50:39 Cheese, onions, garlic, and sun dried tomatoes and a bit of olive oil.
2991 2018-07-10 17:50:19 No, the price is already high. It takes conflict to make it worse. This is the point against protectionists. The EU doesn't protect it's members from high oil prices, but it does do a good job of harming their trade.
2992 2018-07-10 17:50:04 @atieyK their using rosehip oil sold in Msia! Maybe you can consider for the future :)

2999 2018-07-10 17:49:17 Why don't you report it in milliliters so it looks bigger!? Isn't that like a tanker full? People need to get realistic here, If you drive a gas or Diesel vehicle stop complaining, you are part of the reason oil is being transported. You are a hypocrite.

3013 2018-07-10 17:46:27 Guys - love your stuff. have ordered like 15 times in a few months. But you gotta slow down with new products, and focus on keeping in stock the basics. No mac n cheese, no olive oil... :(
3014 2018-07-10 17:46:16 Well I tell ya what if I ever live near an oil spill I’ll be the first one out there with a bottle of dawn saving the ducks !
3015 2018-07-10 17:46:02 The thing is Andrew as you know there’s nothing like satisfaction from doing a job yourself. There’s not an awful lot to do on the RS3 bar an extra oil change between dealer visits and the older GTD makes up for that

3020 2018-07-10 17:45:41 fuck yes found a a amazing garlic/chillie oil today at a store! this shit is heaven with pasta!
3021 2018-07-10 17:45:34 That means #ninfowars can sell more snake oil.
3022 2018-07-10 17:45:27 I'm DOWN.  Just have to be careful of oil
3023 2018-07-10 17:45:27 Brad Hayes is now a regular contributor to JuneWarren Nickle’s Daily Oil Bulletin.  About once a month he will publish an article providing deeper perspectives on aspects of the O&G industry.  Brad’s first article “Is the ‘Shale Revolution’ Working for Oil?” appeared July 9th.
3024 2018-07-10 17:45:22 And it’s ya’ll my dear. 
3025 2018-07-10 17:44:58 If this is the case then why is Uganda flooded with Eritreans, Sudans, Rwandies, Cubans?  These people should go & develop their countries instead M7 NRM pretending they are refugees. Sudan has so much oil, Rwanda has moved on,Eritrea should do the same&so is Cuba. UGn'tdevyet.
3026 2018-07-10 17:44:49 Alberta Finance was predicting crude to average $55 for the period.  Oil price was lower at $53.49.  This had nothing to do with the price of oil, which even now is still trading well below the averages we were seeing just 4-5 years ago.  #abpoli #ableg
3027 2018-07-10 17:44:47 Just got an oil leak fixed in my transmission and right after I paid the mechanic Elon Musk showed up with a billion-dollar zeppelin to fix it
3028 2018-07-10 17:44:42 US is instructing Saudi to increase pumping crude oil ! This the main aim of the meeting
3029 2018-07-10 17:44:41 This would be the first no-JV car factory in China's strictly JV car industry. It will want the experiment to fail badly. @elonmusk, if you are worried about the Koch Bros and the Oil Industry, get ready for real adversaries ... they all are party bigshots, BTW.
3030 2018-07-10 17:44:32 Could also be a specific thing. Like my stomach cannot tolerate certain gingerly oil so I mostly skip dosa if served. Used to be a problem, but once I've narrowed it down to what I can't tolerate I've not had issues.

3033 2018-07-10 17:44:16 @realDonaldTrump @TeamCavuto @cvpayne @Varneyco @atillathehun3 with oil prices increasing which in turn gas prices going to high. Y don't the #USA oil producers stop exporting our oil and refine just what we produce.
3034 2018-07-10 17:44:09 Trading returned to the negative territory on the Nigerian Stock Exchange @nsenigeria  on Tuesday with market indicators declining by 0.60 per cent due to losses by some oil majors.

3036 2018-07-10 17:43:47 Question. What happened to the notion they we'd become energy independent? Did that evaporate as we exported all of the Oil we've been extracting here, domestically?
3037 2018-07-10 17:43:41 How much does the carbon tax contribute to capital investment hesitation, especially compared to things like the price of oil and even things such as pipeline access?
3038 2018-07-10 17:43:36 t’s true and if that makes me anti Semitic then so be it. Israel in the Golan heights it belongs to Syria. But they’re in digging for oil. Greedy manipulative tyrants

3042 2018-07-10 17:42:45 Stop fighting in wars you have no right to be involved with and your budget would be less. But you need the oil of course.
3043 2018-07-10 17:42:44 Did we ever recieve the money owed us from Kuwait from liberating them and protecting they're oil from Iraq?. Which politicians pocket did that go in?

Method

Soak the soya granules in hot water for approximately 15 minutes. Drain, squeeze out all the water and keep aside.

Heat the oil in a pan / kadhai and add the cumin seeds.

3156 2018-07-10 17:30:10 It's pretty simple.  Look at our dollar in relation to oil prices.  Look at our GDP.  Do I have to spell it out for you?  You have already lost the argument over the groping due to the fact it's an issue, it happened, leave it.  @walkaway
3157 2018-07-10 17:30:05 "I said I will do this thing, then I forgot to do it and missed this big opportunity again...."

Chale! You sure say na you don dey say all these things all this while. 

Obobi! Go church go wash head with oil ASAP o. 

Make e no be say monkey born one, two die

3160 2018-07-10 17:29:56 He just assumes these things will be okay. Zero thought behind it. That's for other people.

Problem is when you put in that zero thought that's when the spivs and snake oil sellers take advantage. They tell you is red tape and it needs to be gotten rid of......
3161 2018-07-10 17:29:51 No.  Again.....if you have too many "ifs" on your team you will fail because only some of the ifs work out and some of the sure things will underachieve.  The Oil never learn this.
3162 2018-07-10 17:29:42 I also had a bad experience at Towery, and they left me with an oil leak (didn't replace a rubber component at the drain plug) . Time to use their competitors!

3165 2018-07-10 17:29:31 I hate people who think they know everything cause they cam change oil 
Like no dude jumping your car isn't going to work just because it turns doesn't mean it's your fucking battery
3166 2018-07-10 17:29:29 As refreshing as an oil diffuser?
3167 2018-07-10 17:29:28 Do not expect other countries to be war mongering over oil revenues such as yourself! Plenty of civil wars go on in this world unnoticed! The world is not  black and white, winners and losers and your time on it is finite, as is your dictatorship!

3169 2018-07-10 17:29:12 Keep saying this and maybe it becomes true. However it wasn't true after referendum, or before. Snake oil salespeople have worked hard to convince people that burning down UK is good idea, but it certainly isn't what people voted for 2016

3174 2018-07-10 17:28:34 If you don't own an oil well or 1000s of oil wells, but you do own lungs & need air, why are you denying climate change?
3175 2018-07-10 17:28:28 Think it's time we leave NATO and join Russia in a new pact.  We should rip up NAFTA as well. and put huge trade tariffs up everywhere. Do everything we can to increase the price of oil to help Russia.  Also we should hand over the Ukraine. DO everything in Russia's interest.
3176 2018-07-10 17:28:22 いぇーい2進数の話は少し興味あるので聞いてみたい
3177 2018-07-10 17:28:16 I just knew there’d be the lazy “Oil!” responses to this . 

Other nations don’t have oil but do have democratic socialism and have similar performance.

He's probably gonna kill it in Serie A. 
3186 2018-07-10 17:27:35 So we bought a decrepit pipeline to sell oil to a country we started a trade war with?  Savvy?

Perhaps you could tell me why auto wasnt even on the table for Nafta.  We were a side bar, not a priority. 10% of our economy.

3193 2018-07-10 17:26:56 You can't borrow from Peter, to pay Paul.  We can't delay paying for our use of hydrocarbons.  If we don't pay the real price for our use of plastics, coal, oil, etc., future generations will pay so much more.

3195 2018-07-10 17:26:42 Loss of global capital did mean selling to Canadian firms though. Plus price of oil is a serious thing given the high cost of oil extraction as well. How much does carbon tax add to that cost? (Genuine question)
3196 2018-07-10 17:26:40 What change of heart
3197 2018-07-10 17:26:25 Took to big of a rip off the oil pen now I’m over here wheezing.
3198 2018-07-10 17:26:22 As an Oilers fan I agree 100% Matthews should be paid more than McDavid.  Pay the man and feel our pain in Oil town where you can’t afford to pay anyone else.
3199 2018-07-10 17:26:22 Double edged sword.....trump would use this to as a tactic to promote Republications in the midterms.   Remember he is a snake oil salesman and unfortunately he has a following.
3200 2018-07-10 17:26:22 Every generation or so, we have a massive oil boom. The one in the 1970s bestowed us with all the infrastructure we have. The one NOI and GEJ presided over left us with.............?

3204 2018-07-10 17:25:51 Stir fry is something fairly simple, just buy some vegetables, doesn’t matter what kind, then get some olive oil and just cook it for a few minutes. You can also add sauce or spice if you like. You can also put meat in it.

3210 2018-07-10 17:25:14 Yesterday I called to schedule an oil change for Wednesday. I told the dude I was free all day. He said “okay, how about 8am?” 

I hate that he knows I’m 24 yrs old & should be capable of waking up early so now my adult ass already hates tomorrow..
3211 2018-07-10 17:25:06 Well. I didn't end up in a vat of hot oil with my limbs being devoured by hungry picnic goers, so...yeah I guess I'm fine.
3212 2018-07-10 17:25:06 i wanted to go thrifting after i got my car fixed (if it doesn’t cost too much ajdkksls) but just the oil change is already more than i was expecting ; ^ ;
3213 2018-07-10 17:25:04 When as a govt tied to oil revenue, you find yourself at the bottom of a commodity supercycle with no fiscal buffers, that’s a dire place to be in
3214 2018-07-10 17:24:55 Wat else to expect with a bunch of monkeys n a gramasewaka running d country? BDW @ArjunaRanatunga is reveal who pressured him to release d inferior shipment of oil! All talk no action as usual, merely to hold on to cabinet portfolio
3215 2018-07-10 17:24:52 My wife got Cbd oil for the dog, hoping it will chill him out when he has to ride in the car. He doesn’t respond to Benadryl, so my hopes are not high
3216 2018-07-10 17:24:49 I mean I'd pick him because of his business ventures that involve digging. To that end I'd also bug all the oil companies that have gotten quite good at digging and placing pipes for oil extraction.

3220 2018-07-10 17:24:35 All of them plus a new market of oil to I assume.
3221 2018-07-10 17:24:28 The U.S. has been purposefully brought down by previous admins from an economic giant + military powerhouse — to subsidizing all other countries for their allegiance (+ low oil costs) w/trade deficits, $$$ aid, free technology, out-sourcing American jobs & military protection.

3226 2018-07-10 17:23:36 Our days of fighting surrogate wars with Russia may be over. They are destroying us from within. It didn’t even cost much either. Cash & hotels for trump, Chinese deals for Ivanka, ass saving loans forvKushner, funneled NRA $ to all GOP. My Senator has deep ties to Russian oil.
3227 2018-07-10 17:23:23 Correct, Suadi Arabia does too I believe. But that probably because they got oil so the energy cost compared to the need since they are in the desert and there is water scarcity, so makes more sense economically for them.
3228 2018-07-10 17:23:19 I've been thinking about converting to consuming food, yah know as opposed to motor oil, but to be honest I'm not quite convinced yet. We'll see how this plays out. Thanks for sharing.
3229 2018-07-10 17:23:19 Or stop invading other nations and killing hundreds of thousands of people for oil & financial gain. This will ease the #migrants crisis in #Europe for humanitarian reasons & will enable them to deal with the economic migrants who cause issues.

3301 2018-07-10 17:15:27 America is the most consumer driven society in the world. With around 5% of the world pop. consumes 20+% of the worlds oil prod. To have balanced trade the rest of the world, Americans need to use less as trade is demand driven. Trump may (accidentally) fix that with tarriffs

3318 2018-07-10 17:12:52 I’ve been seeing that! I do need a good oil for my hair. I mainly need a good moisturizer too. I think I’ve found a good leave in conditioner lol
3319 2018-07-10 17:12:47 @Kokomothegreat you mean besides a bj?  I will  guess a oil deal which sanctions is blockingso my guess is sanctions what you thinking
3320 2018-07-10 17:12:45 Well, for starters......enormous tax cuts that's put more money in everyone's pockets, finally getting pipelines underway so we don't have to purchase oil from middle east, peace negotiations with NK, better trade deals, 2 SCOTUS picks plus 48 other judges appointed, 4% GDP...
3321 2018-07-10 17:12:24 Dichotomy a false construct since there r a variety of ways 2 grow, raise, catch food (plants & meats) that range from very bad 2 very good (e.g. palm oil- monorcopped vs intercropped agroforestry). We should b focusing on BEST production methods rather than "good" or "bad" foods
3322 2018-07-10 17:12:02 Even the best oil, raw or uncooked causes endothelial inflammation.

3325 2018-07-10 17:11:52 I had to go back to . I heard the olive oil one doesn't have the harmful products in it and that's the one I was using
3326 2018-07-10 17:11:52 I started with very firm, as I'd heard it had a texture closer to meat and I'm using it as a "main protein". I typically drain it a bit before cooking, cut and plate and season it, then cook in vegetable oil in a pan on medium-high heat.
So far, it's been very forgiving!
3327 2018-07-10 17:11:48 Don’t be so stupid,Dor isn’t for sale,you’ll see,it’s the real golden ticket cos it’s not easy to buy and is almost forgotten about,but lenni is going to set it alight,once we have proven oil
3328 2018-07-10 17:11:43 STEO has production growing by 960K/day from April to December. What pipeline constraints are people talking about for NG, Oil and NGL?
3329 2018-07-10 17:11:39 We’ve done that on our Civil War destroyed village Castle and they did a good job 
3330 2018-07-10 17:11:28 Thanks but no thanks @gcoc306. Your $104.99 synthetic oilchange suddenly becomes $165 because I need “European Grade” oil. How can the DEALER do the same for $89?? Good thing I asked before your dudes pulled the plug!! #ripoff #neveragain #badbusinesspractice #beware #yxe
3331 2018-07-10 17:11:19  No cold pressed coconut oil is safe!!!!
3332 2018-07-10 17:11:13 Something is off.
Russia and China are part of SCO they have always been trading. How does war games near North Korea threaten Russia but not the ones with Japan. Oil prices also hurts Saudi Arabia. Russia has been in Syria since soviet times. You make trump sound like a genius.
3333 2018-07-10 17:11:09 Lunch today: whole wheat pasta with sautéed shrimp and spinach, with a garlic olive oil sauce & Parmesan cheese. 
3334 2018-07-10 17:11:06 And don’t forget while these big oils are making the profit of their lifetime due to deregulation, people in developing countries are killing each other over the rise of oil prices! Fair trade or rip off? In the USA the average price per gallon almost $4.00!
3335 2018-07-10 17:11:06 My '05 SE R burns oil at a astronomical rate... And I'm not the only one. We need now a recall to fix our cars. Motors are blowing up with no check engine lights or oil lights due to no oil in car @Nissan @NissanUSA @NissanMotor
3336 2018-07-10 17:11:04 Heads up: @PSNSandIMF will hold an oil spill response training exercise on Thursday. During the exercise, crews will deploy response equipment near the west end of PSNS and in the water in between the shipyard and Port Orchard. Not expected to impact ferry operations.

3341 2018-07-10 17:10:28 I mean yes! But it's literally not an aioli without garlic (and olive oil. those are the two things that separate from a mayo which can be made with any ol vegetable oil)

3350 2018-07-10 17:09:42 "Oil prices are back up to their highest levels in more than three years. U.S. production has topped record levels, hitting 10.9 million barrels a day in the last week of June . . . But as of May, nationwide oil and gas employment is down 21% since 2014 . . ." -- wsj
3351 2018-07-10 17:09:32 You forgot the many hundreds of wells abandoned by the Oil Companys who want Albertans to pay to clean them up.

3355 2018-07-10 17:09:15 Egypt has oil. Per capita oil revenue in Egypt is similar to Nigeria’s. Oil as % GDP also similar. Difference is that they have huge forex receipts from tourism.
3356 2018-07-10 17:09:12 How did I get oil paint under my knee
3357 2018-07-10 17:09:00 I had a Acura getting $20 oil changes lol what makes this camry  so special .... 
3358 2018-07-10 17:08:59 Took the car to my local Ford Quick Lane for an oil change. Which begs the question, can you really call yourselves Quick Lane if it’s taking 1:45 for an oil change?

The real tragedy was that they had “The View” on in the lounge...

I grabbed a Lyft and said take me anywhere.
3359 2018-07-10 17:08:54 not many ppl kno this but Carly Rae Jepsen is actually Justin Trudeau's sister. the Trudeau family actually abandoned her in the woods when her first words were "oil companies are bad and indigenous ppl deserve rights too." wild stuff but 100% tru.
3360 2018-07-10 17:08:53 McDonald's use natural beef flavouring still in the US. Additionally, often with fast food the meat and fries are cooked in the same oil which clearly would be cross contamination.

These are not the things I needed to do today. This is not self care because it is procrastination.

3369 2018-07-10 17:08:05 oil drop 굿
3370 2018-07-10 17:07:58 The biggest issue is the fear mongering and lies spread by @MikeHudema and @Greenpeace with clearly little to no knowledge about the Oilsands, or the oil and gas industry as a whole. Also the clear bias against Canadian oil and not against foreign oil.

So disappointing.
3379 2018-07-10 17:07:02 Water & gentle soap, good moisturiser afterward. It doesn’t have to be expensive at all, coconut oil are great, it doesn’t clog the pores & it’s not greasy.
3380 2018-07-10 17:06:58 Lemongrass and lavender oil mixed smells amazing . This might be my new favorite scent .
3381 2018-07-10 17:06:58 why not cut out the middle man and just chug vegetable oil straight from the bottle
3382 2018-07-10 17:06:45 All soft drinks, refined oil, on line packing, petroleum products/ paint etc will be banned. V good.
3383 2018-07-10 17:06:41 India sud stop buying palm oil or put  more tax. You will see they will bend

3389 2018-07-10 17:06:17 Oil rigs may end their days as valuable artificial reefs. A large group of international researchers have encouraged environmental authorities across the globe to rethink the idea of removing oil rigs, wind turbines and other installations in the sea when they are worn out.
3390 2018-07-10 17:06:06 FWIW, the US has more clean, fresh water and oil than China does. As to minerals, it varies based on type.  While China is certainly making greater R&D efforts, their inventions and patents fall way behind the USA, by a wide margin.
3391 2018-07-10 17:06:02 Avoid damaging the natural oil in your hair. Peroxide, alcohol and bleach are known to strip oil from the scalp and hair.
3392 2018-07-10 17:06:02 Kentucky .. they'll probably make him the town hero.  He'll one-up himself by causing an oil spill in the local drinking water purification plant - they'll love that.

3395 2018-07-10 17:05:44 An esthetician pet peeve of mine is seeing coconut oil in face products. Coconut oil is comedogenic and will break most people out. It's great for the body, and good for removing makeup, but stop using it as a moisturizer, natural beauty industry!

3424 2018-07-10 17:02:47 Is it fair to compare the production and export of oil to the Iron as Kevin ended that with? Or is that ywt again another inconsistent infrastructural comparison?

3438 2018-07-10 17:00:58 Samaak, mau diguyur oil seliter juga kalo ngga di pencet banget ngga bakal bisa aku :(

3440 2018-07-10 17:00:51 Me, an intellectual:  Dad can you come pick me up I don’t want to wait at the oil change place.
3441 2018-07-10 17:00:41 @JerryBrownGov is supposed to be an advocate for our communities and representatives of real people, not servants of greedy corporations and puppets of Big Oil lobbyists. #EndDependence on #FossilFuels and #ClimateFools
3442 2018-07-10 17:00:40 Yes, but he can immediately work it out again. Skin is unbelievably stretchy (post-pregnancy belly also disappears within few weeks, when you work out), unless you‘re past reproductive age (both sexes). Oil is a myth, it only keeps skin surface smooth.

3447 2018-07-10 17:00:22 Canada under Trudeau even with oil industry crises is a country full of jobs. Rotation of capital in the society giving every Canadian food on the table and roofs over their heads is achivement and resukt.

3452 2018-07-10 16:59:59 And who supports Iran? Russia! It's the same game plan as Syria. The USA weakens the existing governments then Russia claims the oil rights in Iran & Syria. The payoff Russia compromises our computer networks and guarranties Rupublicans and the Trump Family stay in power!

Cooked on Charcoal grill. Used oil lamps & flashlights. Had plenty of canned goods in emergency closet . Actually was fun even without tv still had a radio
3455 2018-07-10 16:59:37 Here I am, sitting at the Bergstrom Jeep dealership with my moms Jeep getting an oil change since she’s on vacay. My Jeep Wrangler obsession is growing stronger and stronger by the minute... send help.

3460 2018-07-10 16:58:52 If you have dry skin I’d recommend using an oil underneath this foundation. It always cakes off of my face if I don’t use oil

3476 2018-07-10 16:56:42 ...the 1st electric log was done in Cabimas in 1929. The semi-sub (Giliasso) was 1st used in Lake Maracaibo reducing drilling/completion from 17 to 2 days. In 1929, passed the 1st oil activities water protection law in LatAm. Venezuela was always a fertile ground x innovation.
3477 2018-07-10 16:56:40 My experience dealing with friends with allergies...Soy is the absolute worst to avoid these days.  Soy oil is taking over the world it seems, I blame cheap American subsidies on soy which replaced corn and canola on many mid west farms
3478 2018-07-10 16:56:34 Also our hard working Prime Minister Trudeau is a sincere person active and devoted for his duties and  responsibilities. He is doing great. Not just by claims but judged by result. He moved the country from a devestating, catastrophic oil industry crises to hot active country

3484 2018-07-10 16:56:14 @GreenBeautyTalk I have been looking everywhere for this answer but I finally have to ask:  what does one do with the leftover herbs from a hot oil treatment? Reuse?  Make a paste?  Discard?  Seems like a waste to just discard them.
3485 2018-07-10 16:56:03 Guys i dont see why u ar disrespectful to th comm. she asked a simple qn, giv an answer. Whats worrying is th fact tht both MDC and Zpf sms hav pples names & area. Whr did bth Zpf & MDC gt th #s? Lets b objective, just a bit coz i knw others & objectivity is lik oil & water

3489 2018-07-10 16:55:28 Imo this thing has failed in GT Sport, I’ve seen many GT players with 99,999 mileage exchange. PD should include full body customization, car wash and oil change + more driving gears like GT6 and purchasable using in-game cash instead of mileage exchange.
3490 2018-07-10 16:55:21 I will try anything. I've used cayenne pepper (not deterring), neem oil (to protect the leaves from bugs) and recently chicken wire. Thanks for the tip!
3491 2018-07-10 16:55:12 Best part of hot oil treatment? Hair so soft.
Downside that I smell kinda like pasta

3498 2018-07-10 16:54:38 I really like roasted broccoli - just toss in olive oil, salt and pepper. You could also toss in sesame oil and soy sauce if you have them. Tends to be crunchy rather than soft, but gives a great nutty flavour.
3499 2018-07-10 16:54:35 Sebald. See how you something else: a state capital, Sacramento, is a man walking, dressed in bright, thick oil paints.
3500 2018-07-10 16:54:32 Our European & Canadian “allies” have literally leeched our blood and money for decades and it is time for a change in that relationship.

The only downfall is it can't go up steep grades as fast as our old diesel but the 7.3 doesn't do much better.

3509 2018-07-10 16:53:36 Last year so many things went wrong for the oil. They are a much better team than what last year showed. Special teams is such a momentum singer. And Talbot has to play much better. They let in 14 first shot of the game goals last year. That was a huge part.

3519 2018-07-10 16:52:33 Dude try coconut oil mixed with baking soda. I reaked for decades until I tried this. Those commercial deodorants are toxic and the natural ones don't work.
3520 2018-07-10 16:52:19 Earlier, the State Department's director of policy planning, Brian Hook, reaffirmed that the Trump administration was aiming to "increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue from crude oil sales."
3521 2018-07-10 16:52:02 Please Trump tweet more and drive this price up.  Any publicity is good publicity for oil bulls.
3522 2018-07-10 16:51:56 His remarks were preceded by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's pledge to stand firm against US threats to ban the Islamic Republic’s oil sales.

3527 2018-07-10 16:51:37 "If they want to stop Iranian oil exports, we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the Strait of Hormuz,” Ismail Kowsari, the deputy commander of the Sarallah military base, pointed out.
3528 2018-07-10 16:51:34 @FLGovScott @SenBillNelson @RepTedDeutch 

First of all, there should be extraordinary fines against the source polluters and secondly, why don't they filter out the algae as it passes through the locks? Treat it like an oil spill and extract the harmful contaminants!
3529 2018-07-10 16:51:30 Making that oil money. He knows what he's doing
3530 2018-07-10 16:51:28 The statement came after Reuters cited an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander as saying that the Islamic Republic would block the Strait of Hormuz so as to stop oil traffic from the Persian Gulf if Washington reinstates sanctions against Tehran.
3531 2018-07-10 16:51:21 How world governments treat oil "we must use and do anything to get this limited resource, even at the expense of our own supply of it."
3532 2018-07-10 16:51:11 Pompeo stressed that Tehran "should know that America is committed to keeping sea lines open, keeping the transit of oil available for the entire world."
3533 2018-07-10 16:51:06 Oh is that so.. does it feel sticky after apply it on moisturizer? I feel like the moisturizer would remove as i apply the oil 
3534 2018-07-10 16:51:05 Small illustration smart don bring oil and gas inside the matter  all this friends of oil and gas engineers
3535 2018-07-10 16:51:01 The US is poised and ready to ensure uninterrupted oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz despite threats from Iran, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told Sky News Arabia on Tuesday.
3536 2018-07-10 16:50:59 Oh dear, I need an oil change too...
3537 2018-07-10 16:50:58 Last week, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that Tehran would close the Strait of Hormuz to oil traffic from the Persian Gulf if the United States renews sanctions against the Islamic Republic.

3542 2018-07-10 16:50:25 Chia has little choice, but all are good bets. Rattie has scored at every level - he wasn't given a chance in CHI or STL, averaging < 10 MPG., but with Oil last year (15 MPG), he produced 2.5 ShPG. Yamamoto more of a passer, but has also produced points at every level.
3543 2018-07-10 16:50:08 So many flip flops. pretends he didn’t officially play something when it goes wrong. Hes a snake oil salesman when it comes to gambling.
3544 2018-07-10 16:50:05 While in the UAE, Sec. of State Pompeo said the US wants to show Iran that its actions have a 'high cost,' stepping up warnings after Tehran threatened to disrupt Mideast oil supplies, via @AP
3545 2018-07-10 16:50:04 Oh. Ingen en droppen of oil in a five minute engine test. Sounds like we are going to leave the stand after all.

Innovations pioneered in or by Venezuela accompany our oil history: the first torsion balance, precursor of the modern Gravimeter was tested in the Eastern Basin (biggest Bouguer anomaly in the world); drilling for shallow waters was developed for coastal Maracaibo Lake.

3570 2018-07-10 16:47:00 You can thin it with unscented massage oil, make it easier to get good coverage.

A little bit of clove oil goes a long way.

I was using the massage bars because they're cocoa butter based & good for my skin.

When others tried it, they did get bit where they didn't put it.
3571 2018-07-10 16:46:51 Ohhh man anything related to health sets off immediate alarm bells. People always have some snake oil to peddle, and the "science" they need to market it.

3574 2018-07-10 16:46:43 We are a one of the largest consumers of palm oil in the world, palm oil lobby too is deep rooted and remain as bad as oil or diamond lobbies existing all over. Amusing ! Neither Palm oil  our natural diet  nor healthy still its been forced upon us.
3575 2018-07-10 16:46:42 We add a small amount of sustainable palm oil to stabilise the product and help stop it from separating.

How are things at your 4 homes??

How is Socialism, you know, the something U have NEVER been part of, but still using your SNAKE OIL practices of selling America’s younger population!

How about PROVING what U say, Bernie Wild Hair!!

3580 2018-07-10 16:46:13 My brother and I have been best friends lately. It’s weird man. I wonder when we’re gonna go back to being like oil and water
3581 2018-07-10 16:46:12 the churning is probably their term for the homogenization process used to bind the oil, water and milk casein together. Without it, you'd have an oily wet mess.
3582 2018-07-10 16:46:10 But we now have an obligation to them, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

3584 2018-07-10 16:45:45 They also have no problem with printing extra money, raising the minimum wage above their means, etc... further driving up hyperinflation. They have possibly the best oil reserves in the world, and the worst form of gov’t possible. So yes, socialism sucks. @chrysjin

Eucalyptus oil as well.

You blame the govt for what private enterprise is doing.

Also, Trump & Putin both want to export:

- influence

3595 2018-07-10 16:44:49 2 , when we have full control of all revenues raised inScotland we won’t have a deficit . Your deficit is 1 year in 300 . Every other we produced a surplus , ( prove me wrong ) that’s why Wm stopped publishing them in 1922 . And all that without oil or whisky . We’re leaving bye

3602 2018-07-10 16:43:58 WTI oil at $74.13/barrel, +$0.28.
3603 2018-07-10 16:43:57 Very true, self-compassion is the foundation upon which we can change the world. Too many people “push through” the bad days. They push their minds and bodies further when it’s already on empty and break down rather than stop to refill the gas and change their oil.

3605 2018-07-10 16:43:46 Please, if you're on your way home, and you have to take the ketu/ojota route, I'd advise you divert to another route or chill due to heavy traffic and over 12 oil tankers on the road with motorists.

3606 2018-07-10 16:43:44 Boot Turkey as well, they are becoming extremely radicalized and bought oil from ISIS.

3609 2018-07-10 16:43:18 For a pipeline that spilled oil a year after they were forcibly ejected and prosecuted for their protest?
Any pardons?  Beyond the oil co?

3613 2018-07-10 16:43:02 I’m sure he does, but; he is putting on muscle, which stretches the skin, muscle he will likely have to lose for S5 of OL. Many pregnant women use oil to keep the skin supple to reduce the likelihood of stretch marks. So my question was, what does he do to protect his skin.
3614 2018-07-10 16:43:01 missing my dad extra hard today! s/o to all oil field workin dads leaving their family weeks at time to go make that cash!!! so grateful for my favorite man.

3619 2018-07-10 16:42:42 If it's non-dairy why does it need to be churned at all, let alone triple churned? We're not making butter here. It's made of water, sugar, casein and coconut oil. The "churning" is actually just the blending of the oil and non-oil ingredients to prevent separation, isn't it?
3620 2018-07-10 16:42:30 I know. And I am more interested in renewables development than oil but a second oil boom would be a nice wee boost to smooth the course of independence.
3621 2018-07-10 16:42:07 Fed claims control of prices, including assets from stocks, to bonds, to real estate. its mission is price stability, begging the question, prices of what?  My looking back view is that Fed should have paid attention to stock and oil prices, since 1970s, not  *inflation baskets*
3622 2018-07-10 16:41:56 Hey Zabrena have you ever thought of doing a list of recommended sunscreens? Especially for the face that won't make you look like a oil slick or at least tips to make it more manageable? Because I don't appreciate my sunscreen making me look like a grease ball.

It's only a question of time until we run out of oil, so we're going to need other forms of energy to power our cars.

3631 2018-07-10 16:40:31 so even with no oil revenue at all, it would still have a PPP GDP of ~$60k per capita. a US program of democratic socialism would have less money to play with, but OTOH we wouldn't have to worry about capital flight nearly so much

3634 2018-07-10 16:40:17 Personally I wouldn't cook with it. I'd cook with vegetable / sunflower oil, and just drizzle a little sesame oil over it all when it's ready to be served. Are they raw or cooked prawns?

3648 2018-07-10 16:38:45 The S&P 500 stock index hit a four-month high on Tuesday, boosted by higher oil prices and strong earnings, while the U.S. dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen as investors bought riskier assets.

3652 2018-07-10 16:38:28 U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 hitting a four-month high, as energy companies got a lift from firming oil prices and strong results from PepsiCo signaled a flying start to the second-quarter earnings season.
3653 2018-07-10 16:38:17 That coconut oil be doing my hair justice 
3654 2018-07-10 16:38:16 E.g. one of the chief global economic uncertainties is political strife and war.
It tends to whack up oil prices.
Good indeed for oil companies, rotten for the global economy.
Some business will cease, some will adapt. But the result will be - less business.
3655 2018-07-10 16:38:11 ....further in debt, NO MARIE ITS NOT OK, and if our "friends" were TRUE friends they would contribute for their own defense! Oh and if Germany's Angela Merkal would quit buying oil from Russia which helps Russia NOT NATO

3668 2018-07-10 16:37:13 Unfortunately...
Panels don't move oil.

Pipelines or trains are really your two options there. 
Commitees have very small freight capacities.
3669 2018-07-10 16:36:43 My own personal hell: waiting forever at the dealership for an oil change and tire rotation while reading outdated magazines, and hurting your neck from reading your phone
3670 2018-07-10 16:36:41 Ok I’ll accept that. I prefer creatures to lands then. I just love the oil paintings Karl does. I use foreign 4th lands anyways. Too poor for betas.
3671 2018-07-10 16:36:36 The previous governments catered to the wealthy few and very little of the country’s oil wealth benefited the poor in that country. I support any government that sees to the prosperity of all its people, not just the traditionally privileged classes.
3672 2018-07-10 16:36:35 One could make the case that Fed was tighter than it should have been. But data (you do believe in data, don't you?) clearly shows dramatic plunge in policy rate over period in question. Not sure what you mean by world price of oil was "permitted" to rise.

3678 2018-07-10 16:35:31 The only good thing about oily skin is that u can use the oil as natural highlight
3679 2018-07-10 16:35:13 You want to allow oil drilling on public lands. NO! Mines can now dumb wastewater in streams. Plus this administration is allowing the killing of red wolves, cubs in dens, grizzlies, & now even lifted protections on sea turtles & whales. GOP is allowing desecration of wildlife.
3680 2018-07-10 16:34:57 I oil cleanse off my makeup, follow with a foam cleanser, then a laneige toner. I’ve been using neutrogena hydro boost line’s water gel moisturizer, serum, and eye gel. With the differin, my cheeks are on baby booty status!

3687 2018-07-10 16:33:54 Neither are socialist. That you think it is, is why economic illiteracy abounds. They're social democracies & have free market. Eventually, socialism MUST turn to communism, to exist before collapse. Norway's inching to precarious as oil reserves has fallen, however.
3688 2018-07-10 16:33:30 On the grill with some seasoned salt and maybe a little olive oil, sure.
3689 2018-07-10 16:33:29 You are more than welcome. I always appreciate good writing. BTW, have you written anything about that snake oil salesman Nigel Farage. Would really like to see him hoisted on his own petard!!
3690 2018-07-10 16:33:29 It was completely illogical for him to push for peace with #Eritrea because of "regional integration" when we already invested billions in #Djibouti.  I guess the oil pipeline was the point of no return for #Eritrea and they had to make peace using puppets in Ethiopia.
3691 2018-07-10 16:33:15 I agree. The gov. really isn't good at running businesses. It was mostly snarky commentary about what is considered 'essential' to Canadian economy. Ability to access large swaths of the country, no. Oil pipeline 1/2 of Canada is unsure about, yes.

3693 2018-07-10 16:33:06 Republicans are selling off our national lands to their deep-pocketed cronies in mining, gas, & oil. Voting a Democratic ticket will restore our parks and Nat'l wildlife *IRL*

3697 2018-07-10 16:32:34 Great job by Folk Oil Company for Firing the very insensitive manager that wouldn’t let her employee take time off for her son on life support! @CynicalMother @BrotherWease @billmoranradio @JohnDitullio @PaulyGoogs @Radio_951
3698 2018-07-10 16:32:29 I’ve ordered some similar shorts which are arriving Thursday. Send the Turkish oil wrestlers around then.
3699 2018-07-10 16:32:17 Sanctions to Russia have not diminished. Only the price of oil grew. But the US public debt has grown to 21 trillion. Because China receives almost a trillion dollars from the US annually. And this money buys all.
3700 2018-07-10 16:32:08 Oil change at Duval Ford today. Tell me tires were overinflated. Only brought my car (with 23k miles) to Ford dealers. Would think $950 set of Pirelli's should last more than that... Terrible that dealer points finger at other dealer instead of helping. @FordService

3703 2018-07-10 16:31:55 Why can’t Gorsuch be impeached. Not on grounds of conduct or ethics but because his position was gained through a violation of the Constitution. There is precedent for the impeachment of Supreme Court justice

3707 2018-07-10 16:31:35 We don’t need or rely on oil. Oil is a bonus. Scotland is one of the most resource rich nations in the world. Our people are inventive & resourceful, so we excel in tech, gaming & other industries. And that’s before oil factored in. 
3708 2018-07-10 16:31:26 Calling this "salad" feels very MidWestern, insofar as it is on-brand with other abuses of the term they use commonly (cf: Snickers salad, jello salad, etc.) I'm not convinced "one ingredient + an oil" passes my bar for "salad" though.

3710 2018-07-10 16:31:13 Recycle, compost and reduce all you can. Push for oil and plastics bans. Bike & walk when possible. If you have conservative reps, hound them to put the environment above old economic perceptions and 'priorities' Speak up and out.

3721 2018-07-10 16:30:11 Wrong! This is a new line. Larger. New route. Different oil. This is not a replacement.
3722 2018-07-10 16:30:03 The war in Sudan is because of money and the shell BP Corporation being down and all the oil being closed they don't have their own money, or Even stipends, how long has this been going on my mother used to say at least since 1932

3725 2018-07-10 16:29:53 Shocking that ppl would fight a pipeline when the alternative is oil by rail, which also hurts the Canadian Oil industry to the benefit of irresponsible (socially and environmentally) countries like the OPEC members or Russia. This can't possibly be considered a positive outcome
3726 2018-07-10 16:29:48 Please warning to OPEC oil prices very high ...
3727 2018-07-10 16:29:43 Are you f*cking kidding? 

SC couldn’t be more “unmoored” from the Constitution! “Originalism“ is snake oil sales talk for corporate and unfettered Executive power. 

Travel ban and anti-union rulings? Come on!

Hillary’s picks would have protected rights of all.
3728 2018-07-10 16:29:16 Waiting for an oil change. Toddler is quietly reading and the baby is napping. So, I’m claiming this as me time.

3730 2018-07-10 16:29:01 I had that once and no lie, if I'd been allowed to use a garden claw on it I would have. Slathering it with tea tree oil was the next best thing.

3750 2018-07-10 16:27:08 Trump's latest scapegoat for damage his policies has caused is OPEC, they have raised production so they're not the reason for higher prices. Steel is used extensively in the gas and oil industries so his tariffs are one of the reasons

3755 2018-07-10 16:27:02 Oil prices rose on Tuesday on growing supply disruptions in Norway and Libya, but gains were pared after the United States said it would consider requests for waivers from Iranian oil sanctions.

3760 2018-07-10 16:26:36 EIA sees OPEC-14 crude oil production down 10kbpd to 31.92kbpd in June, with losses in Libya (-240kbpd) and Nigeria (-70kbpd) offset by gains in Saudi Arabia (350kbpd to 10.47mbpd).

3761 2018-07-10 16:26:20 One year ago today oil was trading at $45/barrel.  Today, it is at $75/barrel.  Just paid nearly $4/gallon for gas in Vegas.  Not sure why the media outlets are barely covering this story - probably because they are all too caught up in annoying political talk.
3762 2018-07-10 16:26:04 @dankraker spills were the most important factor?  What about CO2 -- climate change?  FYI -- I have 12K of solar...and will soon be driving an electric car.  OIL?  Fossil fuels...are dead.(or at least need to be taken off line ASAP) -- GUN to the head? Man-up! Jezz...

3775 2018-07-10 16:25:00 Not in India at least. That's why on your MILK statement I said don't generalise. Out here yr favorite OILS get advertised besides all HC junk. However, we on LCHF love VCO, Ghee and Butter. Soy is a BIG no like all n6 PFA Loaded crap oil. Medical reports show we are doing good.

3786 2018-07-10 16:23:53 Peppermint oil, or any other kind of oil, is an old wive's tale and doesn't actually work at repelling spiders. Best you can do is find possible places where they're coming in a sealing them, and also making sure your house is free of their prey. Sorry, no miracle solution.

3809 2018-07-10 16:20:39 Venezuela has an authoritarian problem.  It has an OPEC problem.  It has one major export: oil.  

None of this has anything to do with a single payer health system, which would be the best remedy for runaway health costs and poor health outcomes in the USA.
3810 2018-07-10 16:20:34 Haha. But oil would‘t do the trick anyway. It‘s hard slog heavy lifting through varying muscle masses. And that sounds just like Sam‘s idea of paradise.
3811 2018-07-10 16:20:21 @realDonaldTrump If we see exemptions from the oil sanctions, we will no longer support you, and you will certainly be in trouble in the elections.

3816 2018-07-10 16:20:05 @TiresPlus I was charged $1.10 per 1/10 quart for oil in my oil change yesterday. This is 100% robery. Had i known you were going to charge me $15ish for 1.4 quarts of oil I would have left the store in a heart beat, this is crazy. Dont say shop fee was charged that seprate.

3821 2018-07-10 16:19:37 @realDonaldTrump The Americans are watching the government under your remarks, which will drastically lower US credibility. It's ridiculous that one day we will say that Iran's oil is zero, the other day they say we will exempt some.

3832 2018-07-10 16:18:37 I haven’t thrown it out yet! Which oil do you recommend?
3833 2018-07-10 16:18:37 Yep.  And a president of the US should give a damn about public lands, which belong to the people.  All the people, not just cattle ranchers, mining companies, oil barons, ad nauseum.

3844 2018-07-10 16:17:48 正直だいたい合ってるけど、じつは我々人類がその延々と繰り返す側の存在なんです。

その方法だと自分たちが全滅するほかないけど、神の計画はその上を行っていて、神の子なる主イエス・キリストを己の救い主とする者は、罪からも、死からも、すべて完全に救われるのです。

3849 2018-07-10 16:16:52 I love MP with the texture like this. A bit crumbly. But husband loves it when it is soft, the ghee MP type. You need to remove it a bit early for that. Adding little oil along with the ghee also helps in getting the soft but crispy texture.

3853 2018-07-10 16:16:20 Caloric/time restricted eating, vegetables, beef/fish/poultry, fruits sparingly, healthy oils (not fucking canola oil). This is literally all you need.
3854 2018-07-10 16:16:18 do you know what fraction of the Norwegian economy is oil rents?
3855 2018-07-10 16:16:13 Mr T complaining about the rise in the price in oil, when at the same time has sanctions on Iran, Russia and Venezuela. Action by the squeeze output/supply = higher oil prices.  This is not rocket science.......
3856 2018-07-10 16:16:08 Hey I'm alone today at work from 3-430 is you are available for a shoot. I'm pretty backed up, but I have been soaking my juevos in a nice sesame body oil lately. Makes them nice and soft, just gotta stay away from Chinese food.
3857 2018-07-10 16:16:07 Exxon isn’t burning billions of barrels of oil. They’re mostly selling that oil to other people to burn
3858 2018-07-10 16:15:57 Maybe we economists just worry too much and just need to enjoy life a bit more.  While we have been fretting about tariffs, trade wars, oil prices, slow real wage growth, and geopolitical hotspots, U.S. equity markets have been rallying -- hard.  I'm going to lunch.#twomartinis

3889 2018-07-10 16:11:05 Habit replacement is only one of the many strategies I use help clients help themselves. Sometime though their need is better suited to other specialists and I’ll either refer them, or look for a professional that’s not selling snake oil.
3890 2018-07-10 16:11:00 @Cowboycerrone Do you have a promo code for Onnit? I need to get some MCT Oil.
3891 2018-07-10 16:10:57 So CBD oil (medicinal cannabis) is legal in Ireland. However, shops that sell it (e.g. Holland and Barrett) are not allowed to recommend or discuss the product. The oil has proven time and time again what wonders it can do. We need logic.
3892 2018-07-10 16:10:54 I literally got an oil change Monday and I’ve already put on 1,000 miles. Fml

3896 2018-07-10 16:10:19 As a child I liked to hang on my moms leg while she was cooking. One day she was frying something (never seen her deep fry anything, ever), and sure enough I tripped her, spilling hot oil on my head- which promtply erupted in flame. Got a scar on top of my head forever now.
3897 2018-07-10 16:10:18 It never fails to amaze me how you think 97% of scientists are liars for private interests yet it's the 3% who are untainted and definitely not on payroll of oil and coal companies.

3907 2018-07-10 16:09:47 Werkelijkheid is complexer: juist schaarste aan winbare aardolie -> méér 'unconventional oil' en méér gebruik van steenkool in de energiemix -> meer emissies per kWh.

Paradoxaal genoeg draagt schaarste van (winbare) aardolie zo extra bij aan klimaatprobleem.

3961 2018-07-10 16:04:43 Look, I am tired of this. You believe it is useful. You use it. But remember it is just a@metric invented to appease the US insecurity in its need for oil. No other country that is both a producer and importer ever bother with this metric.

3967 2018-07-10 16:03:56 I'm skeptical. I commute to work by electric bike myself, but I see an awful lot of cars on the road. Even in BC, we have a large fleet of gas-burning vehicles. Under IEA's 450 ppm scenario, coal phases out quickly, but oil consumption stays flat for quite a while.

3984 2018-07-10 16:02:13 @JimMcKayChevy how does my girlfriend come in for an oil change (loyal customer for years), leave with a broken passenger seat bc of large tech (your words), then told they won’t fix it, instead offering a discount? HOW IS THAT HONEST? #badservice #dishonest

3987 2018-07-10 16:02:01 Go for just a oil change they try to make up shit saying shit wrong  nigga everything under the new I got done in the winter foh
3988 2018-07-10 16:01:48 Perhaps, the USA should produce all of the world's oil.

Why?

We do it much more cleanly than the rest of the world.

We do it w/ very low emissions.

Awesome!

WTG, America!
3989 2018-07-10 16:01:40 3. The "No major infantry wars" is so stipulation-filled it all but admits how weak the argument is. We don't fight ground wars like that anymore. But we are currently bombing seven countries around the world, mainly in the Middle East - where the oil is.

3991 2018-07-10 16:01:33 Hi, @theresa_may - now's the chance to prove your priministerial chops and do these two things:

1) Admit that the snake oil sold by the benighted Leave campaigns is undeliverable and pause / withdraw A50
2) Tell @realDonaldTrump that, ta, but he's no longer welcome, cheery-bye
3992 2018-07-10 16:01:32 get rid off that dirty palm oil plantations and plant trees and bring forests back alive
3993 2018-07-10 16:01:32 Answer me this... Why would Russia want Trump? Their entire economy is oil/gas. Trump ramped that up, depressing prices and crushing their economy. HRC would've squelched drilling and fracking, helping the Russian economy greatly.
3994 2018-07-10 16:01:32 I think someone in my office stuck a Slim Jim in an oil diffuser
3995 2018-07-10 16:01:30 just the orange oil without the petroleum jelly will do it - the jelly is just the medium to make it easy to rub onto and off your hands
3996 2018-07-10 16:01:30 The snake oil salesman techniques of the leading Brexiteers seems to be what they have in common (UKIP, Tory or Labour).Selling rubbish to people who don’t need it is not what makes people fit to govern and is the road to ruin for Britain.
3997 2018-07-10 16:01:29 Do petroleum companies make stuff up to justify their money grubbing plans? Probably, but who knows. By 2040 people like @elonmusk will have figured out how to make more profit from selling energy without oil, so really I think it’s ridiculous to invest in 90yr old tech.

4000 2018-07-10 16:00:48 Your skin will feel oily but rosehip oil absorbs pretty quickly so it’s not uncomfortable. The oil always goes last and preferably at night so you don’t look oily all day.

Even though a 10 year old could probably do it.

4046 2018-07-10 15:56:23 Oil prices rising and rising which is not good. Better is to avoid it's consumption as much as possible.
4047 2018-07-10 15:56:20 Not me, I remember why I voted in then and out in 2016. It's all about the change from a trading block to a Pan-European German Superstate. Lest you forget, we were also looking toward a world without oil, an ice age and a world unable to feed it's billions. How times change!

4104 2018-07-10 15:50:27 True and encouraging, but also an artifact of unhealthy shift away from meat and toward obesigenic grain, sugars and seed oil. Factor in increased health cost to be accurate. That said, meat and veg now also cheaper than before, so more attainable generally.
4105 2018-07-10 15:50:25 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

4111 2018-07-10 15:49:40 Neither necessary nor sufficient. Denmark, Sweden and Finland don't rely on oil, therefore not necessary. Norway's oil production has declined since the 90's also. Countries such as Venezuela and Mexico have large reserves and aren't success stories, therefore not sufficient.

4114 2018-07-10 15:49:27 Even in peace, the oil guzzling military uses up vast amount of resources and emit huge volumes of CO2. War results in plumes of particulate matter, increased pollution of land, air and water, and intolerable strain on resources. And they only fight for oil.
4115 2018-07-10 15:49:20 Faulting I think is taking your car to get the oil changed by yourself

4120 2018-07-10 15:48:44 Its similar to oil spill in clear water. I had never seen blurry rainbow like clouds or pink or green before 2-3 yrs
4121 2018-07-10 15:48:42 meu unicorn oil chegouuuuuu 
4122 2018-07-10 15:48:24 Alors je sais qu'il y a un nouveau studio impliqué, mais je crois que la team d'origine a fait la majeure partie du taf (et Oil Ocean est toujours relou mais m'a semblé moins débile)

4127 2018-07-10 15:47:27 Err @realDonaldTrump is referring to EU/US trade.. 
The $ is the world reserve currency... because America is the world's largest economy.
Oil is mostly sold by OPEC 
America wants fair trade.. its that simple.

4140 2018-07-10 15:45:40 Lol. Dylan, you're forgetting how strange professional philosophy looks to the uninitiated. It's just weird. But look, throw out the silly comparison to philosophy. Con law is an arcane subject. I agree. It takes "20 years of burning the midnight oil" to learn, says Blackstone.
4141 2018-07-10 15:45:39 Today was suppose to be my first day doing oil changes by myself and the customers flaked on their appointment... wow
4142 2018-07-10 15:45:34 I'll trim the leafy parts off but keep them and cure some of the buds for vaping but I'll make coconut cannabis oil with the rest of it.
4143 2018-07-10 15:45:34 C'est la team de Whitehead qui a bossé sur Plus ? J'avais cru comprendre qu'un nouveau studio était finalement impliqué (Et ils ont corrigé ce putain de boss d'Oil Ocean ou bien ?)
4144 2018-07-10 15:45:30 Every time I get an oil change, someone asks me if I want to sell my Jeep  noooo way, Joyce is my baby!
4145 2018-07-10 15:45:27 Olive oil helps with the BAD knots or dreads but still it’s such a bitch. I’m gonna have to start braiding my hair and wearing a scarf when I sleep, hopefully that’ll help ugh

4152 2018-07-10 15:44:53 Instead of using your power as a consumer to avoid things that we don’t need and are bad, just be vaguely mad at a conglomerate of corporations who are also doing tremendously bad things. Do all of that from your space age computer, which is made of oil and will be trash soon.
4153 2018-07-10 15:44:47 Now I'm sure the United States would've helped and set military aid in the soccer team cave rescue if there was oil found in that cave.
4154 2018-07-10 15:44:42 Even the edibles help with the pain. I've been using them since April when I got my cancer diagnose. I decided to use that as my main pain relief.  My daughter is now trying to learn how to make CBD oil at home. Makes me glad I voted for legalization.

4158 2018-07-10 15:44:30 This coordinated use of the term "competitor" was for those who want to tap into that sweet Russian oil money.  Greed will be our downfall.
4159 2018-07-10 15:44:20 Use lots of coconut oil once it stops giving off heat. It will turn into a beautiful tan and minimize peeling.

4173 2018-07-10 15:43:30  I’ve taken the whole lawnmower apart. Spilled oil all over my porch. 

And still haven’t figured it out.

4176 2018-07-10 15:42:52 Today I learned an essential oil diffuser can make your floor slippery.
4177 2018-07-10 15:42:48 Removed the intake manifold and fuel injectors. Removed the oil temp sensor. Replaced the oil pressure sensor. Broke the oil pressure sensor. Thankfully got a 2nd new oil pressure sensor. Installed 2nd oil pressure sensor. Installed the intake manifold and fuel injectors

4181 2018-07-10 15:42:36 @DrOz blah blah blah the science isnt there - about essential oils not proven to do things other than being fragrance.  but after decades, why isnt there any science on them?  i bet the big pharma's have the science, just like the essential oil from pot, aka marijuana cbd
4182 2018-07-10 15:42:35 California's 'foreclosure capital' to give away $500 a month to residents in experimental welfare program. Saudi Arabia gives oil revenue to its citizens, now they claim their lazy and have people from other countries do the heavy lifting. Do we want that here California.
4183 2018-07-10 15:42:22 A good person does not promote war or hate or greed or inequality does not pollute our planet and water for money or try to strip basic human rights from people make money off of war oil companies or greedy corporations all politicians need to take a deep look at what they do
4184 2018-07-10 15:41:59 Eye exam and new glasses and I got my oil changed I accomplished leaving the house and adulting today can I take a nap now?
4185 2018-07-10 15:41:46 U got time, u can go with oil all over who will care 
4186 2018-07-10 15:41:15 Fuck yeah bro. Oil is fun if you don't got anything pressing to do or anywhere to drive for awhile.
4187 2018-07-10 15:41:10 Questions about Minnesota's recent approval of the #Line3 #oil #pipeline? I'll be on @MPRnews at 11 with Kevin Pranis from the Laborers Union and Tara Houska from Honor the Earth. What do you want to know?
4188 2018-07-10 15:41:07 And, even if they “let you in”, will oil and water ever mix?
4189 2018-07-10 15:41:04 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
4190 2018-07-10 15:41:04 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4197 2018-07-10 15:40:20 Another big reason we need to flip the House is to begin to restore our transition to a clean energy economy.

Let’s make our nation the center for 21st century sustainable technology jobs.  

Let’s slow catastrophic climate change and prevent oil drilling off of our coast!
4198 2018-07-10 15:40:15 I’m ready to go home and they taking they time on this oil change

4201 2018-07-10 15:40:02 Worth it if China is to retaliate with currency war? Transmission is pervasive compared to trade war being more targeted. Would it help with its internationalisation or a backfire to it's plan? Yuan oil acceptance, IMF, bond issuances are key building blocks.
4202 2018-07-10 15:40:01 Except we have lots of evidence from people that it *does* make it bitter. Our current theory is either there are some people who are more sensitive to this kind of bitterness, or maybe it has to do with the specific oil in question. It’s not the garlic, It happens even without.
4203 2018-07-10 15:40:00 きいいい…うらやましい

4207 2018-07-10 15:39:54 やっぱ尼崎ってスラムなんすねぇ
4208 2018-07-10 15:39:54 And indeed not needed for anything - their economy is in the toilet and they produce zero products. Maybe the US wants to try and import cheep Russian oil!
4209 2018-07-10 15:39:44 I'd be cool to do contract work for mars, people already do it for crab boats and oil rigs. Some times taking a job means 6 months of being unable to go anywhere else, 2 years isn't too much worst than that

4215 2018-07-10 15:39:10 I think they juuust passed cannabis oil here. It's on the ballot for Nov though
4216 2018-07-10 15:39:09 Oh no, I love coconut  I would use a neutral oil like avocado oil instead. A couple of tablespoons will give you 250 calories.
4217 2018-07-10 15:39:05 Not really . You invaded more countries and took more money off other countries through oil . Only fair I reckon that you pay more for your greed and deplorable war mongering ..
4218 2018-07-10 15:39:04 Fox News Anchors know that when Mr. Drumpf lies, a #GOP member secretly wants to become politician
4219 2018-07-10 15:39:03 It’s horrible but you have to get through it. It’s also a good tactic to say you had a horrible experience after and they’ll virtually blow you after. I did that and got 6 free oil changes
4220 2018-07-10 15:39:01 The lamb skewers are legendary! I also always grab "wontons in chili oil" then one of the boiled beef or fish dishes. Their only thing not worth eating is fried chicken pieces thing, imo.

4233 2018-07-10 15:37:28 I predict that global companies will find ways around the tariffs, not unlike the oil surcharges of the 1970s where cheating was rampant and the oil surcharges totally ineffective. They just made crooks out of lots of people.
4234 2018-07-10 15:37:25 The voice of betrayal:

7:10
A time set to the practice of 'dabbing' or vaporizing pure marijuana concentrated oils known as BHO or butane honey oil. 7:10 on a digital clock upside down (old hedd pager codes) spells OIL. As opposed to 4:20 which is the act of smoking marijuana flowers.

4240 2018-07-10 15:36:26 Happy 710 day to all my oil heads 
4241 2018-07-10 15:36:19 I would recommend vitamin D, magnesium and fish oil. And amino acids like taurine may help. But if your gut is not healthy(parasites, dysbiosis, leaky gut etc.) it is important to fix it as it impacts our emotional/psychological wellbeing. Gut is being called as our second brain.
4242 2018-07-10 15:36:18 Just spent so much money on oil changing tools since I have a different car and need bigger tools but at least I won’t have to do that again next time 
4243 2018-07-10 15:36:11 Honestly I slept until I felt like sleeping, I walked the dog at a glacial pace, now I have coconut oil in my hair and a face mask on and I’ve finished my entire French press and I’m just so happy.

4246 2018-07-10 15:35:53 Lol. Olive oil gets skanky after a while...and more likely to burn the house down than poison you.
4247 2018-07-10 15:35:52 My coconut oil has been liquid for 2 days straight...its too hottttt.

4249 2018-07-10 15:35:35 The old oil has never done nothing to my skin though, I’ve never had any break outs or rashes. & it comes off easily with dish washing liquid and sand as long and you used lard or baby oil. Just Incase you wanna try it.

4258 2018-07-10 15:34:43 will the taste of the coconut oil be masked? cause i really hate the taste of it
4259 2018-07-10 15:34:38 Makes sense if Trumpet wants a lower oil price

4261 2018-07-10 15:34:26 But Europe must have the same   amount of stolen oil from Arabic word especially from Iraq  Saudi Arabia kwait Qatar.


4262 2018-07-10 15:34:09 Some of the ingredients are here for a down move (VIX flat finally, oil selling off, dollar holding) but a .50 down move on SPY v the $9.5 up move kind of trivial and dangerous for shorts.  Flow favoring short but let's wait.

4280 2018-07-10 15:32:26 No oil is on the food triangle. No refined sugar. No refined flours. All of these are energy without the total food package. Glucose isn’t poison & neither are lipids. They can just be consumed at quantities that become chronically deleterious to health. Avoid/limit all refined.
4281 2018-07-10 15:32:23 Jane Fonda probably lives in one of those neighbourhoods that own shares in oil companies & the dividends pay for their property tax. And now they’re attacking the Canadian oil sands to push prices back up because now these poor Hollywood stars have to pay their own taxes.

4286 2018-07-10 15:32:14 I use a regular skillet for this and it came out fine. Just be gentle with the oil. I don’t use cast iron too often, normally only if I’m going from stove to oven.

4339 2018-07-10 15:27:04 It's good to know that $300M was spent to procure fuel in 2017 but half of that amount went illegal to Liberia and Guinea, at the Mano River basin Sierra Leone is the lowest on gas oil sales. Kick out corruption and change of attitudes!
4340 2018-07-10 15:26:57 I’m a realist who knows how business works. We will never compete with City financially unless another Oil Baron fancies a flutter. That said we played them 4 times last season and beat them 3. And we’ve strengthened significantly this summer.
4341 2018-07-10 15:26:52 For me it has been trial and error. I started out with the baking soda vinegar combo but it was ultimately too drying. I now make a runny paste of powdered herbs and add coconut oil and lavender essential oil.

4359 2018-07-10 15:24:44 Sugar phobia is a scam. Whole food fruits & starches contain more than sugars. To distill it down to this(or call a food a protein, carb, or fat) is to ignore isocaloric foods aren’t always isometabolic-an over simplification. No refined oil, flour, or sugar on the Food Triangle.

4368 2018-07-10 15:23:32 one aspect.  then there is oil and gas, big one.  and PGE etc. another titan.  he threatens the status quo in a very big way. innovation like his must be controlled and owned in the structure's view and doled out when it works for them.

4380 2018-07-10 15:22:39 And the US helped stage this coup bcz it wanted the oil and gas deposits in the Black Sea. Once Yanukovich decided to accept Putin's economic and gas offer and not proceed with steps to joining the EU is when this whole thing exploded.

4385 2018-07-10 15:21:59 Sorry are you saying crude topped around 75 but XLE will continue over 81 as projected? If oil corrects now xle will go south to, no?
4386 2018-07-10 15:21:58 Wondering if we are over a barrel or we have a strong hand and just are not playing our cards right. Example. Americans put tariffs on our aluminum and steel but still import our ore tariff free.  And our oil too.  They need us big time but we are too nice and subservient.
4387 2018-07-10 15:21:57 I use coconut oil because I’m vegan!! And it works even better 
4388 2018-07-10 15:21:53 Every cell in our bodies has receptors on it so activating gut cells & microbes is incredible therapy. People have been smoking it for years and getting success. Imagine if everyone added oil ingestion too? Oh boy, #health galore!

4397 2018-07-10 15:20:38 I kid you not, I went to check on what I thought was an oil leak. They printed off an estimate for me to get it fixed. The part/patch costs $13.57, but the total bill was $298.70. 
4398 2018-07-10 15:20:33 Also good tip to remove makeup: use rosehip oil or other oils you like!! It will remove eeeeverything

4400 2018-07-10 15:20:21 It was so awesome to watch in real time...the episode about the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was great...another one where they were given fake news. It was a great series.
4401 2018-07-10 15:20:14 “Sir your car is gonna blow up if you don’t....” JUST OIL
4402 2018-07-10 15:20:11 My friend told me you are not supposed to add oil, just get it changed on time, but that check engine light came on right before the oil change, just weeks before and it was driving strange, so I thought it needed oil.
4403 2018-07-10 15:20:04 I just had to wait 2 hours for an oil change and tire rotation appointment that cost $85, this is honestly where i draw the line for adulting, I am tapping out ok
4404 2018-07-10 15:19:54 Over night use a cotton swab or spoolie and run it over your eyelashes. Best if combined with two oils. Ex: castor oil & coconut oil.
Be patient you'll see a difference in at least a week or two. Set an alarm to remind yourself. Only works if your constant.

4411 2018-07-10 15:19:14 GUSH hit its 52 week high of $45.19 but didn't hold. If it breaks it and holds this will be a strong signal for bullish oil etfs. Get cash ready for strong oil balance sheets, serious money will be chasing energy soon.
4412 2018-07-10 15:19:12 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party instead paying 4.6 billion tax payer dollars on a pipeline & subsidizing oil workers and industry spend it on federal EV subsidies to spur green economy & EV production in Canada.

4515 2018-07-10 15:08:19 It wasn’t terrible when the conspiracies were fantastical (alien eye oil) or highly specific to the characters. Like, no, these specific people do not exist and are not running around assassinating and infecting each other.
4516 2018-07-10 15:08:13 Happy Dabs Day everyone! FYI: The date 7-10 upside down resembles OIL which makes this a stoner holiday, representing a day of celebrating all the different marijuana extracts and concentrates enjoyed by ganja enthusiasts all around. #710Day
4517 2018-07-10 15:08:09 Venezuela has more oil per capita than Norway, yet is doing terribly while Norway is doing very well.  You need to be able to wonder what the differences are between these two socialist petro states.

4521 2018-07-10 15:07:57 You know I don't agree with everything our PM is doing but I have to say I'm damn proud that he is looking out for our best interest internationally. I stand with Canada always. He's trying to make sure our dependancy on US oil will be less. I'm proud to be Canadian

4532 2018-07-10 15:07:14 Absolutely. They're paying the DeVoses and their minion FauxNerdGOV Snyder for the Great Lakes. That is if deregulated industries in the surrouding States, and Canadian Oil interests, don't poison it all first. TFW greed is good, until it actually gets in the way of profiteering.
4533 2018-07-10 15:07:13 Someone attempted to assault the opposition candidate today, twice. It was caught on camera. With clear intent to do physical harm.

4552 2018-07-10 15:05:29 For the bacon mayo, you can simply follow any homemade mayo recipe of your choice, but put melted bacon grease (but not super hot, I did mine at below 200 degrees [old stove, not sure]) in place of whatever oil the recipe calls for. Also, I used the whole egg, not just the white.

4647 2018-07-10 14:54:59 Probably cheaper for India to get oil from Iran in the long run than having shale crude shipped across the Atlantic or Pacific when Iran is just around the corner from them. #logistics just don't make sense.

4654 2018-07-10 14:54:36 Billions? To who? Oil companies and sand owners. What are the real external costs of tracking? Destruction of the planet.  #banfracking.
4655 2018-07-10 14:54:30 I wish him luck. I hope he discovers what he likes doing there and that he has fun. My college years sucked ass. I had more fun in Jr high school and high school.
4656 2018-07-10 14:54:22 Isn't #Pompeo always going to receive requests for #US #IranSanctions relief anyway, regardless of whether they will be granted or not. Can't see much relief granted otherwise #USA will lose all credibility. #oil #brent @SquawkStreet @carlquintanilla @SaraEisen @JackieDeAngelis
4657 2018-07-10 14:54:19 Antonin Scalia discussed that "freedom of the press" did not originally mean the media; rather, it meant that any idiot with access to a printing press could publish freely. I think it is interesting that the word Gethsemane, the garden where Christ agonized, means the Oil Press.
4658 2018-07-10 14:54:16 It's not all oil - Texas has over 12,000 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 22,000 megawatts, and it's huge in solar. Canadian company Innergex is now going to build a 250mw solar project in west Texas with capacity to power 53,000 households when complete by end 2019.

4660 2018-07-10 14:54:05 Must support US. Norwegian Oil fund the largest in the world. Over $1 trillion. Should invest a little in Lockheed Martin and other defense industries. Should have helicopters with good ejection systems like in jets. Must invest.
4661 2018-07-10 14:54:02 it's ironic that they are way more likely to be russian paid stooges or bots than you are paid by oil companies. Russia has already supported the anti-fracking campaign here in the usa, why wouldn't it support the warmists as well.
4662 2018-07-10 14:54:00 OPEC is trying to control the physical volumes of oil offered by the market that forms the price offers. Really this figure more.

4673 2018-07-10 14:53:08 U.S. OIL SANCTIONS on Iran. Key questions: 
* If target not zero, how much crude does United States plan to allow Iran to export?
* Which countries will receive waivers? 
* Is the sanctions relief process being coordinated with EU/Russia/China as part of their talks with Iran ...

4686 2018-07-10 14:51:55 Hey Chiswick,
Trump the snake oil salesman is is conman. If he’d just invested his daddy’s ‘loan’ he’d be richer now. He deserves everything he gets including humiliation.

4689 2018-07-10 14:51:29 Good article Nick!

We tend to agree that #Trump #sanction will be even much more effective than #Obama soft #sanctions with real bite on #Iran regime

#Oil prices also will be contained better than 2012-2015 though the market is tighter but #OPEC is more effective as well

4696 2018-07-10 14:50:56 You know, the company that basically has made most car manufacturers move to electric vehicles and is actually doing good for the planet, and the one that should be supported by govt. instead of it subsidizing oil costs and dying coal plants for dying companies.
4697 2018-07-10 14:50:47 Where is the most reliable place I can buy Bytecoin (and other altcoins)? I want to use 600 USD and spread them out on alt-coins (as you said, law of large #'s). Every place I see if embroiled in fraud, controversy, or frozen accounts. How is the safest way I can get them?
4698 2018-07-10 14:50:16 Why does it feel as though the snake oil salesman is winning. POTUS lies, manipulates, and corrupts everything he touches. 2 x's SCOTUS nominations. Unchecked in his dismantling of Govt . Blatant disrespect for our allies.  Emoluments violations go unchallenged. Frustrated

4706 2018-07-10 14:49:36 Well. I’m convinced. I’ve done the Bulletproof coffee/MCT Oil (coconut oil) for a week and feel the difference. Improved mental focus; not the post caffeinated crash that I’m used to.  it’s legit.

4710 2018-07-10 14:48:40 It must be all that fracing the oil companies are doing
4711 2018-07-10 14:48:40 Any more you can do to convince the oil industry to lower their gasoline prices?  The tax reform and tax cuts are going up the tailpipes of the middle class trying to drive to their jobs.  Thanks for being our President!
4712 2018-07-10 14:48:36 Norway has a sovereign wealth fund of over 1 Trillion USD, it grew by more than the entire Scottish Budget last year.
Norway has extracted less oil than Scotland, but it's independent.

4) No Pot holes on any federal road in Nigeria. 

5)Stop Boko haram and SARS

4723 2018-07-10 14:47:57 I'm reminded of 1991 when the Oil lost in the playoffs after winning 5 in 7. My father-in-law called (he a Flames fan) for our annual discussion of the season. "I'm glad they lost," he said. "You're such an ass when they win." I think we're all capable of being that guy or girl.
4724 2018-07-10 14:47:53 im finna test out this lavender oil thing and see if it works.
4725 2018-07-10 14:47:53 Waiting for @sarahkendzior to call it like I see it! Peak oil Nazis are back. Escape this dark money petrol dollar by entering new micro grids using circular economic studies to bring in the new frontier
4726 2018-07-10 14:47:48 Just people willing to get behind the ideas and try them out. The other issues with mass transit involve automakers, auto dealers, oil companies and others who actively work against new tech and ideas.
4727 2018-07-10 14:47:27 As for being ready yes it will be a struggle with the lack of skilled human resources but Guyana is getting a lot of overseas advice. The Sovereign Wealth Fund is expected to be in place by First Oil along with all other legislation.
4728 2018-07-10 14:47:22 Agree, but there’s  more money to be made in the building and running of them, which they do at a huge loss, to oil the palms of those involved at all levels, I’m mainly talking about politicians.
4729 2018-07-10 14:47:13 Ironically, Iran is the quickest solution to America's desire for low crude oil price. IRAN: The problem, The solution.
4730 2018-07-10 14:47:10 WHY YOU NO APPLY HAIR OIL ;___;
4731 2018-07-10 14:47:02 So what is your solution, Paul? Canada needs to make money from some sort of Energy plan. Give us one that works if you don't like oil.
4732 2018-07-10 14:46:58 Trust in the process Katlego, your turn is coming, remember popcorn  is made from the same pot, same cooking oil and same heat but they don’t all pop out simultaneously
4733 2018-07-10 14:46:57 That is a new one! I get diet & mindfulness. Usually it’s put across v.well, unobtrusively & actually sometimes it’s helpful. Like I didn’t know CBD oil was legal (from cannabis).

Other times it’s like “Read. My. Lips. Mindfullness. Make. Pain. Go. Big. Bad. Pls. Shush.”

4750 2018-07-10 14:45:22 folks get excited about oil going from $33 to $75. It will never see $5000 ever. Oil is more likely to fall to 0 or pennies in the future than bitcoin:)
4751 2018-07-10 14:45:15 Bro, I live in Chicago, which is in America, so deal with it. People don't have to be Jewish nor Israeli to stand on their side. Against trash like you who lies to incite violence & death. If it weren't for oil, the Arab world would cease to exist. Compare that to the technology

4753 2018-07-10 14:45:15 A way out of it would have been if the UK had a large sovereign wealth fund. Maybe if the oil was not sold so cheap by a previous government?

4800 2018-07-10 14:40:05 Iran said, "If our Export Gets to Zero then yours will be affected too." So they won't have any export so to worry about it.
After they made this threat, China once again confirmed that they will continue buying Iran oil and even to buy more as they stopped the US portion.

5223 2018-07-10 13:56:36 Sir Ian Wood is a paid stooge by your party, who knew. Also apparently oil is his expertise which has been proven wrong time and time again.
5224 2018-07-10 13:56:34 pasta, spinach, fresh basil, bb tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pep, gr onions, red cabbage, sautéed mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, garlic, garbanzo beans, black olives, capers, banana peps, feta, olive oil, sun dried tomato pesto, apple cider vin, blk pepper, oregano, red pep flakes
5225 2018-07-10 13:56:28 I guess what I’m getting at is we are all expected to make a change that will impact our lives (and our teeth) but oil is still burning. Emissions are still killing the ozone layer. 
But my teeth need to be assaulted by ice cubes on the daily
5226 2018-07-10 13:56:27 Direct quote from the article you posted-
"McCrone said oil remains of huge economic significance to Scotland, but it is, he cautioned of more limited and diminishing value."

So unless you have a time machine, we spent the revenue already.

And peak oil isn't coming back.
5227 2018-07-10 13:56:22 One surprise was that despite more confidence in oil and gas, salaries dropped slightly in that sector. Perhaps Brexit is having an impact across the board?
5228 2018-07-10 13:56:21 Well, oil and gas may not be bouncing back quickly, but judging by the length of shorts at the Stampede Grounds, aestheticians are having a record year.

5234 2018-07-10 13:55:42 All oils are bad but some are worse. So avoid the worse.
I read one article about edible oils. That recommends to use  cold  processed oil. I will check and revert. I think the article was on Sunday TOIa few years ago.

5241 2018-07-10 13:54:58 Gasoline prices are reported to be going up again. Truly there should not be a 20 to 30 cent change in the price of gasoline in just a few weeks. These increases come from big oil wanting more profit and giving the average folks a line of BS so we accept the price hike, and then

5243 2018-07-10 13:54:54 A Bernie presidency could have been a vital historic turn, an example of still functioning democracy shifting to reflect long suppressed popular views, on war, oil/climate, healthcare, inequality, corruption. Instead, exposed fully rigged system, w/ pressure building to disaster.

5254 2018-07-10 13:53:47 That is not true. We do not have oil Reserves to produce from. Russia produces oil. Pulling out of the Iran deal was great for Russia not America. Trump pulled out of the G7 after demanding they reinstate Russia. Not good for America. Starting Trade Wars not good for America.

5265 2018-07-10 13:52:13 Aside from a probable bump around the oil crash - which I assume would have probably affected older generations more - then I assume so. Unless there's been an income recession I haven't noticed?

5267 2018-07-10 13:51:47 Was it Teddy Roosevelt that took on the big monopolies and brake them up? If I remember my history correctly by the time he was done the big oil companies like Standard made even more because they still controlled the oil. Slippery slope. Higher standards on new drugs.
5268 2018-07-10 13:51:44 So it’s ok to go around randomly bombing sovereign states for OIL? You must have forgotten to take your meds. Murder is murder, but it’s even worse when it’s mass murder.
5269 2018-07-10 13:51:39 It’s rosemary oil. The worse part is idk if I’m using it wrong and overappling it, if my skin is too sensitive to it, or if it’s just a bad product.

5318 2018-07-10 13:46:51 This restaurant uses lots oil on their food
5319 2018-07-10 13:46:51 It’s because they need poor kids with limited economic options to fill the ranks of the military for their oil wars.
5320 2018-07-10 13:46:49 It strikes me that using a small country whose oil exports account for 50% of exports and 20% of GDP, and which fuels the largest sovereign fund in the world, as your proof-of-concept that democratic socialism is viable may not be the most scaleable argument.

5346 2018-07-10 13:43:57 I think you should just cover the news and stop hyping junk ideas. Remember you thought the GE play at 29 was brilliant. Hyping it for some hedge fund. Or oil at $110 was going to $200.

We need data etymology

5355 2018-07-10 13:42:44 And what then about the laborers who work for the oil companies? Is every orange jumpsuited blue collar 2 on 3 off derrick jockey in shreveport and venice just fire for the feel good machine? This is why socialists irk me, all talk, no planning. Its why they killed so many.
5356 2018-07-10 13:42:38 So much for the oil change that shit could wait line to long
5357 2018-07-10 13:42:34 Was taking oil massage from mumma 
5358 2018-07-10 13:42:28 Is this the stance that Snake Oil Dan Hannan himself takes or is this his idea of what others believe? The difference is rather crucial.
5359 2018-07-10 13:42:25 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
5360 2018-07-10 13:42:20 What's weird is that clearly some of these companies are solving real problems quite well - but they have to promise AI because of its snake oil powers of making boring hard work seem magical
5361 2018-07-10 13:42:12 They said the same thing about sending oil riggers with no NASA experience to an asteroid to blow it in half to save the earth. But how did that go?

5366 2018-07-10 13:41:46 OK oil try that thanks man
5367 2018-07-10 13:41:45 I'll just point out here that Russia is quite interested in oil reserves in the Arctic Circle, some of which are in Canadian territory.  What happens if America becomes the pawn of Russia, like it's moving toward?

5370 2018-07-10 13:41:33 Japan is an advanced civilization. They perceive future better than any other nation. They have to secure future of their children. Cannot jeopardize it to please whims and fancies of oil controlled mindsets
5371 2018-07-10 13:41:27 2/2 Now Cramer hypes oil, daily. About the ONLY reason you started hearing about pipeline shortages in Permian is EXACTLY the same reason Goldman's Jeff Currie switched 180 degrees. To curry favor with Saudi Aramco IPO. There is NO peak oil. Europe shale aint even started.
5372 2018-07-10 13:41:23 I’m thinking in context broader than just online, not such specific areas like ecommerce or search engines. In those contexts both companies are daunting. However, brick and mortar stores still claim 94% of all retail sales. Rockefeller monopolized the oil industry, illegal now.

5380 2018-07-10 13:40:37 They said they were 'starting'. It is possible to offload such investments quickly - just sell at whatever price you can get. I suspect that is NOT the way the CoE will go about getting out of oil and gas.

5400 2018-07-10 13:37:40 Rosehip oil ni bagus ke untuk oily skin?
5401 2018-07-10 13:37:39 Greg, the increase in wildfires is from climate change caused by carbon emissions. If you want to help Oregon protect itself from wildfires you would talk about and support renewable energy, instead of the GOP’s anti-climate, pro-oil, denialist agenda. No oil in Oregon, Greg.
5402 2018-07-10 13:37:23 Does it not burn?
I use Coconut Oil, olive oil n castor oil. N it helped. It didn't cure it but it is not as bad  as it used to be

5432 2018-07-10 13:33:53 Pathetic oil money- makes it unfair for everyone else
5433 2018-07-10 13:33:44 In context that most oil is sold in dollars China - a giant oil buyer- is major purchaser of $s. Pretty hard to shield.

5437 2018-07-10 13:33:02 Because most of Libya oil is on East Libya. France only need the oil and France presence is not only limited to Libya.

5581 2018-07-10 13:16:34 Again, wrong. It's a democracy going the way of dictatorship because of a collapsing economy from privitization of state oil companies and a drop in the price of oil. V has a direct dependence on oil and doesnt have s diverse economy. So inflation is out of control.

5634 2018-07-10 13:11:10 I use cannabis oil. Its so expensive because of growers risk. Being caught with oil is not a problem being caught growing the plant is. Sad for the poor who cant afford to use it. It works wonders for my eldery moms arthritis. Painkillers hammered her kidneys.
5635 2018-07-10 13:10:59 Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has asked Kenya to declare the holder of its $74 million (Ksh7.4 billion) stake in its proposed oil refinery ahead of the investment decision to be made in May 2019
5636 2018-07-10 13:10:44 Didn't read the article but is the answer... oil?
5637 2018-07-10 13:10:39 Indian Government bonds ended little changed today, even as a rise in crude oil prices heightened fear of domestic inflation rising. Market players also fear a sharp rise in the June CPI print, to be released on Thursday. Trade volumes remained muted today.

5642 2018-07-10 13:10:30 Meaning, there was NEVER a democracy. Big banking & big oil always got their way. The modern solar cell was invented in 1941 & could've taken a middle class ride to the top of energy after WW2. But Corporate Rule liked the war machine & used it 4 imperialistic rule by way of oil.

5644 2018-07-10 13:10:23 She has a pink leather collar but thanks for the suggestion. She seems a bit too pure to be associated with the oil and gas industry. But if she is, better to have power from the inside I guess ;-)

5665 2018-07-10 13:07:08 I really want the bread & oil from Bertucci’s right now but I’m pretty sure there isn’t one in NC 
5666 2018-07-10 13:07:06 Barclays: "oil bulls ought to beware of Saudi Arabia’s and Russia’s clear willingness to cap the upside in prices. As prices rise to higher levels, the air is growing thin and oil demand is already faltering"
5667 2018-07-10 13:06:59 Turkana receives the same amount of money as Nairobi and can no longer claim to be the poorest.

5671 2018-07-10 13:06:27 It’s great for some people but personally I wouldn’t want to walk around in a fog anymore than I am now. In CBD oil gives me a headache on top of doing nothing for me. And the resin it builds up on your lungs is incredible worse than cigarettes

5676 2018-07-10 13:05:48 The AB economy did get hit by lower oil prices in 2014-15 & the 2016 Fort Mac fire, and it's rebounding b/c oil prices are up and rebuilding has been earnest. That's clear. And that's exactly what the data show.

5682 2018-07-10 13:04:46 No, we have to go "protect" everyone because we make it our own interest, especially when resources like oil are on the table.
5683 2018-07-10 13:04:42 I still believe that they need to legalize just the oils of it and not the part where you smoke and get high.  You don't need to get high to help your medical condition, it's just an excuse to get high. You can get the medical benefits from oil without getting high.

My favorites at the moment are lavender and peppermint oil

5728 2018-07-10 12:59:17 It actually came from a 19th-Century snake oil salesman from England, to be honest. The justification is often, but not always, biblical. And the arguments are the worst kind of pandering to ignorance.

5811 2018-07-10 12:48:56 @AmazonUK Why are you allowing loads of sellers of CBD oil to sell as skin care products? I presume this is so they can avoid the rigours of the GFIN regulation, but people use these products as medicine and they should be catergoris3d properly!

5824 2018-07-10 12:47:09 Scott, Uranium generally contains 2.5 to 3 million times the energy equivalent of coal.  1 kg of U3O8 enriched for a RX equals 10,000 kg of mineral oil, of 16,000 kg of coal.  This advantage is why a Utility will spend billions to build a plant ... since fuel costs are so small.

5832 2018-07-10 12:46:23 With peace deal between the warring parties in South Sudan conflict being brokered by President of Sudan, its likely that the south will ship its oil (once production resumes) through Port Sudan further diminishing LAPSSET viability
5833 2018-07-10 12:46:19 Politics and emotions are oil and water. They don't blend well. Tribal affiliation is centered around emotion, feeling included and validated. That would be ok if the tribe didn't have control of others in mind.
5834 2018-07-10 12:46:18 I didn't present any findings to a regime. I give public lectures on how govs and companies invade people's privacy. If govs and companies want to listen, that's great. Would you blame me for giving lectures about global warming to Big Oil?

5859 2018-07-10 12:42:53 Know thy enemy - vegetable oil has no part in vape fluid. Where you have probably gotten confused is that Vegetable Glycerine is a major component, and a harmless one at that. Other components are poly glycol, food flavouring and, optionally, nicotine. Way less harmful than cigs.

5911 2018-07-10 12:37:21 Nee, 'abiogenic oil' is al jaren geleden door de geologie verworpen.

Dat was een Russische mythe, gestimuleerd in het Sovjet-tijdperk door de voorlopers van GazProm en Rosneft. Er is nog nooit een 'abiogenic' sample in petroleum aangetroffen.

5942 2018-07-10 12:33:36 Yes but its also 1) paper straws are “too soggy” and 2) biodegradable, plant based plastics are more expensive than petroleum based.. and oil companies have a lot of dough.

6056 2018-07-10 12:18:07 Given the fall in the last week or so, and with oil prices likely to be at or near tops, with ongoing NAFTA + trade uncertainty, don't you think any hike would be couched as a dovish one with future hikes on a let's see basis? Can't see Poloz coming out swinging no?
6057 2018-07-10 12:17:48 I can bring you one after the oil change :)
6058 2018-07-10 12:17:45 Friend invited a bunch of us around for “lekker flame grilled steaks” “just bring your drinks and I’ll sort the rest”  he only got 2 steaks which he cut in half for 7 people to share  and poured sunflower oil over it on the braai. I had McD’s for dinner.

6141 2018-07-10 12:07:37 These people look at the NHS and see nothing more than an untapped oil field, just waiting to reward the “entrepeneurs” slavering on the side-lines, waiting to dismantle it piece by piece. This is the company Hancock keeps

You failed to say that the US gave Iraq’s oil to Israel via pipeline who then sold it to China. Alex, you lose credibility that way. @3rdmissouri

6197 2018-07-10 12:00:27 Oil Tip of the Day

If you would not use an undiluted oil on your skin, you most certainly should not use it on your child’s skin.
6198 2018-07-10 12:00:19 If you hate globalism and corrupt big government, start with oil and natural gas.

 They're the only reason we're 30 year allies with Saudi Arabia, and the only reason we started the Iraq War for imaginary WMDs.
6199 2018-07-10 12:00:11 It can be easy to forget, but changing your lawnmower's oil once a year will save you money and keep things running smoothly!
6200 2018-07-10 12:00:09 No but I would like to see more done with the alternatives we have now. We need fossil fuels bollocks do we and the oil barons know this.

6323 2018-07-10 11:42:38 The oil sector in Nigeria is full of opacity, it's darker than the crude being mined. 

That the regulator which also operates as a business continues to run shell companies through which illicit financial flows continue to happen, is depressing.
6324 2018-07-10 11:42:37 Of course, those countries just burn oil and build cars for fun. It's not like there's consumers demanding these products or anything.

6330 2018-07-10 11:41:36 Double cleanse face. Use cleansing oil on dry skin. Wash face with cleanser. Toner. Serum. Moisturiser. Eye cream. Sunscreen. Use mask twice a week. Exfoliate face twice a week. That's my routine.
6331 2018-07-10 11:41:25 I am full of oil and anxienty. Do u think he is slurping or splurging.

6338 2018-07-10 11:40:37 Yeah, I was looking up want she said, and only one site said anything about coconut taking the pigment out. All others say coconut oil is good, so now I'm confused. Mind you, she did use a slightly auburn tint in the brown. Maybe because it has reddish pigment, not sure.

6354 2018-07-10 11:37:58 ROSPA uses mass balance to certify its palm oil as sustainable, so by the very nature of mass balance calculations it means that some isn’t sustainable.  It should all be sustainable... end of!
6355 2018-07-10 11:37:56 Their black soap is quite harsh on mine & my son skin's though. I wouldnt recommend their products to any1 after what i have expirienced. I'll stick to Anim black soap, Ndakana face oil & purpil hair oil. I am scared of everything R&R!
6356 2018-07-10 11:37:50 Tax cuts did nothing for working families. Oil/Gas is up. Produce is up. Trade failures will increase the price of goods & services. 

But the fuckface @realDonaldTrump “isn’t 
a libtard” so I’m okay getting fucked. It’s the black guy that I’m not so fond of doing the fucking.
6357 2018-07-10 11:37:48 The fact that the media has not been consistently calling the war in Syria a war about oil is disturbing. Did anyone notice that Sunday's nightly news on NBC was the same broadcast as on ABC and CBS?
6358 2018-07-10 11:37:25 Leave Twitter, (& maybe the whole internet) get some Lavender fragrance or oil, and listen to Owl City. That would put me in a better mood immediately. :)

Not sure if they are digging for water, oil or gold. Either way looks fascinating...
6372 2018-07-10 11:35:03 Oil man is bored of his plaything now 
6373 2018-07-10 11:34:43 So refiners will just import more and more crude oil because Saudi's make it available? Refiners are really wanting to build up inventories from already high levels while prices are at $70-80? There will be no switching from the other crudes that the US imports?
6374 2018-07-10 11:34:19 Because we are corrupt and can’t wait to steal from our people. The oil export, for instance, could have waited until we got a refinery. Perhaps it is being used to cover our eyes from seeing something?
6375 2018-07-10 11:34:16 Workers on Norway's oil and gas offshore rigs have gone on strike after rejecting a proposed wage deal, shutting down production at Royal Dutch Shell's (RDS.A, RDS.B) Knarr field in the North Sea.

6384 2018-07-10 11:32:25 Further examination of that exercise may reveal that Israel was propped up, so did new colonies from Qatar to Iraq. Must have been difficult naming new colonies with oil. 1930s induced depression for the bosses to buy much like everything. War is good.

6386 2018-07-10 11:32:10 12) I'm an atheist, but it's fairly clear that the Bible talks about how God is love and if someone doesn't know love, they don't know God.

But there are way too many people out there who cling to God and hate.

Which should be like oil and water.

If God = love
Satan = hate
6387 2018-07-10 11:32:05 That's because some of us aren't mindless Lemmings, doing whatever cheetolini says. We have a conscience and a healthy thought process, that makes us realize what a snake oil salesman and POS he is. What's really sad, is some people get off on others suffering

6392 2018-07-10 11:31:20 Russia is highly dependent on exports of natural gas, petroleum, and sophisticated weapons. Look for developments that weaken the Western Alliance and make it easier for Russia to pipe oil/gas across Crimea and a unifed Korea.

6439 2018-07-10 11:24:51 coconut oil is all natural. a&d ointments neosporin & other ointments that have petroleum will draw the pigment out, also different salons use different types of pigments & this is what the girl who did mine recommended & it works for all her clients, thanks for the suggestion!

6448 2018-07-10 11:23:44 Lures just bring them in (HIGHLY suggest getting rid of that or putting it far, far away from your prop); neem oil sprayed religiously on their favorites helps to deter them.
6449 2018-07-10 11:23:44 After shaving apply coconut oil. It prevents pimples/ bumps on shaved surfaces and you also don't itch.

For dark armpits people say they use the Dove roll-on with the pink lid...
But just verify because nna, I've never really had dark armpits problem.. 

6450 2018-07-10 11:23:42 me too. I have the essential oil for a winter fix (it's expensive, though) and Library of Fragrance did a Linden perfume, which is fab.
6451 2018-07-10 11:23:42 First off the Golans were SEIZED by Israel. Secondly why threaten Syria & have another enemy?

6457 2018-07-10 11:23:01 @FairFuelUK @HowardCCox Are wholesale prices still increasing? Few garages where I live all increased prices yesterday, some are more now than they were before the price drop a few weeks ago, yet oil is roughly the same?!?
6458 2018-07-10 11:23:00 It’s sticky so maybe something oil based?
6459 2018-07-10 11:22:46 @ASEAN We just need to plant the oil palm in Sudan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. And I will give your share. If you want to investment. I mark this regions.
6460 2018-07-10 11:22:41 Idk how to react but dispatch really start the war. And that ONE account, you just bring in oil to the fire.
6461 2018-07-10 11:22:38 I hope the business partnership will include oil so that our fuel price can't rise due to the dollars rate fuel price.
6462 2018-07-10 11:22:35 And hands too, it prevents wrinkles there)
And then personally i use tea tree oil when i have pimples or anything (its dries them,, its rlly effective on my skin)
Tip: do face masks at least 3 times a week, face scrub 3-4 times a week(very important), and do deep cleansing+
6463 2018-07-10 11:22:19 Can he comeback with a signed oil deal.

6472 2018-07-10 11:21:19 This protection argument further relates to the importance of  nurturing, funding and protecting USA's needy populations.  We can't  lose sight of the importance of financing OPPORTUNITY for those in need.

Eliminate corps, oil moguls and monopolies from welfare rolls!
6473 2018-07-10 11:21:07 Not just low carbing but consider the COMBINATION EFFECT.  Make sure you are mixing leafy greens and high fiber with any carb.  How's your oil consumption.  When you replace carbs with oils that works until it doesn't.  Cheese, red meat, eggs ... can push weight up in LC diet UGH

6476 2018-07-10 11:20:40 By washing it every day you’re stripping your hair if it’s natural oils so that causes it to produce more oil or barely any. But I’m pretty sure there’s home remedies you can do!!

6478 2018-07-10 11:20:22 I hope you didn't stay short oil for too long. There are legitimate supply concerns, oil will have a few intraday drops but big picture it is headed higher.
6479 2018-07-10 11:19:59 You know, people two or three hundred years from now might like to use the oil reserves of the world for something. Are we going to literally burn it all up so it can't be of any use in the future?
6480 2018-07-10 11:19:55 Tofu to taste good: In Japan they have a soft tofu they deep fry called Agedashi. For home cooking, soft tofu with soysauce with mirin, or with sesame oil, or chili oil. Basically tofu only tastes as good as the stuff around it :D. Chives, scallion, sesame etc.
6481 2018-07-10 11:19:42 The US invasion of Iraq was a major cause of Europe's refugee problem.  Libya was a stable country, an oil business which employed many Sub Saharan workers.  We're not the protector of peace in the world but the creator of chaos.  Now we have a leader hell bent on creating chaos

Trouble with this is that it favours large-scale producers, big companies.
If oil companies are already buying out charging points, this is a bad development.

With a change in the energy market, we could happily move away from those price monopolies and should do so.
6575 2018-07-10 11:03:51 I'm not arguing in favour of banning disposable straws though. I'm saying is that we are running out of easily obtainable oil regardless, so banning disposable straws is pointless, as in the near future oil will be too expensive for disposable plastics anyway.

6587 2018-07-10 11:02:36 The US can only afford this huge military expenditure because it has the world reserve currency and that currency is required by everybody around the world to buy commodities like oil. This gives the US a huge free lunch.

6602 2018-07-10 10:59:30 I've watched some #NUFC matches that have been like a flipbook of oil paintings just so I can walk away dissapointed that we can't score goals.

Why shouldn't an esports fan watch a game where they are guaranteed a solid broadcast just because they have to sit at the TV?

6616 2018-07-10 10:56:47 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

6642 2018-07-10 10:52:58 It’s one thing to have the business side of things in order, it’s another to sell snake oil like the rest of the alternative health industry. People think 10 minutes of Googling somehow overrides decades of science. Quick tip: it doesn’t. #SharkTankAU

6650 2018-07-10 10:52:42 Given the significance of both Canals, oil and strategic positioning within the Arab world, I would argue that it is considerably higher than this. 
Egypt survived the 'Arab spring' despite everything against it. I just hope Egypt learns from past mistakes.

6654 2018-07-10 10:51:42 If they offer it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this thank offering they are to offer thick loaves made without yeast and with olive oil mixed in, thin loaves made without yeast and brushed with oil, and thick loaves of the finest flour well... Leviticus 7:12.
6655 2018-07-10 10:51:22 Correct - and in this case I'm glad we can celebrate the fact that more jobs are being created.

There are fields where there's not enough labor available, resulting in increased wages.

Oil industry is desperate CDL drivers right now. $150k a year with crazy benefits.

6660 2018-07-10 10:50:38 Why does nearly every political party on the planet recognize climate change, except for the GOP? Are countries like Russia, Myanmar, Rwanda on Soros’ payroll? Or is the GOP on big oil’s payroll?
6661 2018-07-10 10:50:16 Good ally would not start wars for oil, call others to aid them and then leave the mess to come to them.
6662 2018-07-10 10:50:08 Did you know - if you have oily skin then avoid using your fingers to apply foundation because the oil secretion will be worse and you’ll get that shiny look. #WowHowKnows
6663 2018-07-10 10:50:07 Let's lool at those actions - all useless. Hope you spend as much effort thanking the actual rescuers as you've done fanboying for a snake oil salesman after a bit of quick PR who'll never give a shit about you.

6681 2018-07-10 10:45:49 Investing in publicly owned infrastructure, solar and wind, as well as cleaning up transport will create about seven times more jobs than the oil and gas industry with  subsequent returns on investment.

Obama did little to curb the military industrial complex...

2) Iran is threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, thus cutting of US oil supplies, in response to US attempts to re-create the oil embargo.

6809 2018-07-10 10:24:56 According to AAA and gasbuddy, my info is correct. And for the record, oil refineries often go "offline" in the summer as to create artificial scarcity during the highest level of automobile travel. 

So really, if you hate it that much. Why dont you move?

6815 2018-07-10 10:23:54 I used to look to books on software & engineering management for answers to vexing questions like, "how to capture requirements?" and "how to prioritize/estimate projects?"

It took awhile to realize these were the wrong questions, and many books promising answers were snake oil.

6818 2018-07-10 10:22:45 My wife once rolled her eyes white, while trying to explain why cars need an oil change, and how viscosity reduces an engine’s capacity. 

I asked her, was I guilty of mansplaining? She said no, I was just boring.

6843 2018-07-10 10:18:28 Then, how much was the exchange rate and how much are we selling a barrel of crude oil? The current inflation rate of 11.6% is fair for an economy that is coming out of its years of waste. Despite that, the government is still investing directly in its people.

Hydrogen needs to be stored under very high pressure and low temperatures.
Needs completely new infrastructure.

And most of all: production is usually large-scale, so oil companies and bis suppliers are involved.
That’s what we need to get rid of as well however.

6924 2018-07-10 10:04:42 We should stop selling you oil
6925 2018-07-10 10:04:41 yes, they are only to stores selling auto and home repair items though.  No fun stuff.  Oil coolers, roof fans, things you would have never known existed in HS.

6932 2018-07-10 10:03:26 It's frustrating to see media evaluate 'progress' in #Libya as basically oil output minus migrant output.

Apart from its moral bankruptcy, it's a very short term and imperfect proxy for the development of sustainable state capacity.
6933 2018-07-10 10:03:26 But Egypt is an oil producing country. They do about 600,000 barrels everyday.

7035 2018-07-10 09:42:42 #Iranian vice president says it's a mistake to think US sanctions against #Iran will have no effect, #Tehran will sell as much #oil as it can despite US 'economic war' with Iran. -@Reuters #Trump
7036 2018-07-10 09:42:36 Actually the best way for Iran to circumvent the US oil sanctions is to make payments through #Bitcoin. Not sure #BTC markets will afford that much liquidity though, but pretty fool-proof. One of the counter parties has to bear risk of BTC volatility though #Opec
7037 2018-07-10 09:42:31 What do we trade in? turn it all into Cash? Crytpo currency? what about a resource, gold or oil?

@SwifferOCE would know what to do.

7056 2018-07-10 09:40:07 Why Iran can block the Strait of Hormuz:

- Economy in freefall
- Civil meltdown
- Iran oppositions active
- Disrupting oil trade with CNY, INR, KRW, JPY, TRY, EUR in place
- Regional tension

They got nothing to lose by dragging their foes into collapse, Kamikaze

7088 2018-07-10 09:35:55 Infant mortality has refuced and literacy improved. Unfortunately the economy was not diversified and so is vulnerable to oil price changes. Also the USA is undermining the country (reducing oil prices is one of the ways  via Saudis)

7127 2018-07-10 09:27:18 There is no land lost to oil production in Turkan. There is land leased for it. The right land  owners should be recognized, respected and registered to receive oil revenue shares direct. Competition is a different item in the list altogether.
7128 2018-07-10 09:27:12 This maybe just the tip of the iceberg as there are many contractors suffering from Governments delayed or non-payments in the Gulf due to the fall in oil price but also due to low economic growth because of self-inflicted conflicts and lack of regional cooperation.

How much oil reserves did the Sudans have then? At peak production, pre-partition, they produced about 350,000bpd. Is that big?
7141 2018-07-10 09:25:41 Drugs are cheaper in other countries because they negotiate ONE price for the entire year for a drug.

The USD is on a fast track to devalue. Todays tough trade talk is panic our allies wont defend the USD$  4 false flag attacks

7170 2018-07-10 09:18:45 Yeah i must not know nothing about the subject except working as an engineer in the oil and gas sector in SEA  and being based in 3 different countries in the region. Silly me.

7173 2018-07-10 09:18:25 A combination of geopolitical supply-side risks, a potential supply crunch, as well as the risk of #OPEC+ reneging on their compliance adherence, is all creating a “perfect storm,” which is positive for near-term #oil prices, Japanese bank MUFG said in a note on Tuesday
7174 2018-07-10 09:18:05 Lmao it looks like that baby oil glow...it glows no matter who got it on my G
7175 2018-07-10 09:17:59 Has there been any #vtpoli discussion about creating a #vt equivalent to the Alaska Permanent Fund?

We don't have giant oil reserves, but something like a #CarbonTax seems like it would be more politically palatable if it put an annual dividend check in Vermonters' pockets.
7176 2018-07-10 09:17:51 Iran says it will still sell as much oil as it can despite 'economic war' with US

7198 2018-07-10 09:13:35 Trolls are people who repeatedly ask the same question when it's already been repeatedly answered.  Engage your brain! It's self-evident and common sense that when you extract oil from plant material you concentrate the compounds within it. If you can't understand this then sorry
7199 2018-07-10 09:13:18 So people think idols should be like plastic dolls who should have a fixed shy smiling expression ,they don't stand rookie grups being successful to their faves

7203 2018-07-10 09:13:02 You might be wondering as to why part of the switch back is closed off? Some scumbags decided to fly tip not only a huge drum of oil, but a large amount of corrosive substances right next to Sparrow Hawks yard. What is happening around here?!
7204 2018-07-10 09:13:00 Good point. It's my understanding that Oil Price regularly rewrites the stories of other wires with their own spin. Nothing against it though.
7205 2018-07-10 09:13:00 So fucking sick of temperaments  if we're spending $ over there might as well take their oil
7206 2018-07-10 09:12:52 =Jul09= And  the strength of the US market is weakened.

7213 2018-07-10 09:11:22 Boris letter most honest he's ever been: Brexit "dream is dying".  Yes, the whole nasty business was a dream! Snake oil brewed from fairy tale juice and unicorn wishes, sold as a remedy to those robbed of hope by their own leaders. I hope the taste of his failure is bitter.
7214 2018-07-10 09:11:10 In a perfect world oil money would be used to reinvent the economy, too often in the MENA it has been used as disguised welfare to keep population quiet (just look at KSA).

What happens if they impose sanctions? Nigeria abandons cooperation on war on terror, ExxonMobil gets jittery and the security situation will not improve.

Oil market is already tight, so they cannot afford to sanction Nigerian crude

7233 2018-07-10 09:08:20 #Inflation news:
Indian inflation likely rose to a near two-year high in June, driven by surging oil and food prices, a Reuters poll showed, a development that would strengthen calls for more monetary policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of India.

But how will the US Government intervene in the Nigerian situation, other than issue strongly worded statements? Are they going to abandon cooperation on terrorism or risk their stakes in the Oil & Gas sector? I doubt it.

7265 2018-07-10 08:59:58 It wasn’t an obvious problem until recently partly due to better measurement but mostly due to hyper consumerism. And the only reason anyone in the West is interested in the Middle East is oil.

7302 2018-07-10 08:53:21 SUNBATHING? Skin cancer? What skin cancer? Attitudes to sun were simple in 1976: the browner the better.
Although SPF had been invented, water-resistant UVA/UVB protection sun creams unavailable & considered completely normal to step out in sun slathered in baby oil

7304 2018-07-10 08:52:42 True. True. Only problem is there are some voters here that will elected him despite (or maybe because of) any dark secrets that get exposed. Let him retire from public service and become the oil industry lobbyist he is destined to become.
7305 2018-07-10 08:52:37 Again had to walk thru Church Street it's still a dirty detritus filled eyesore from Fri /Sat along with the ingrained filth under the benches we now have the market stalls adding to the filth ( oil, diesel, drinks emptied on the floor) Why not cleaned?????
7306 2018-07-10 08:52:32 My fucken reed diffuser!!! I saw it before I uploaded and was like WHAT THE FUCK!! The oil seeped up the curtain!
7307 2018-07-10 08:50:56 They are right! Without corrupt strangle hold of oil companies we would have lots more renewable energy & people would pay less for it too.
7308 2018-07-10 08:50:54 used coconut oil on my hair last night and it look so amazingly healthy this morning! Omg. 
7309 2018-07-10 08:50:49 — canvas was a lily pond. The water reflected the color of the sky. Deep pink and purple hues. They complimented the various shades of green but contrasted against the blue waters and white lilies. All done in oil pastels. A dirty task.

It stinks, but really numbs the pain.
It stinks though.
I may not have mentioned that.
7326 2018-07-10 08:46:16 I think there are important differences. South Sudan turned out quite badly, I don't think they want to repeat those mistakes. Oil exploration in South Sudan was dominated by the Chinese. In Nigeria, the oil lobby will also have its say.

7329 2018-07-10 08:45:48 South and East Asia produce almost 40% of the world’s output of cereals (including nearly 90% of global rice output); close to 40% of global meat production; more than half of vegetable oil supplies; and nearly 70% of combined global capture and aquaculture fish production.
7330 2018-07-10 08:45:24 Although olive oil aids skin recovery when applied to wounds like burns, eating olive oil or foods featuring olive oil also improves wound healing time. Regular consumption of olive oil lowers inflammation and heals the body from the inside out.
7331 2018-07-10 08:44:37 Where you go and what kind of oil you get? They $40 for me at valvoline.
7332 2018-07-10 08:44:25 Van a subir los impuestos indirectos. Por ejemplo: el gas oil. Es injusto para los que menos tienen. Eso es ser de izquierdas? Una más de las mentiras de Sánchez que sigue demostrando ser un `trepa´.
7333 2018-07-10 08:44:25 I appriciate it dude. Been growing it for about a year. You gotta act like a girl with it though. I use beard oil, beard balm, and after a shower I blow dry and curl it with a round comb. Got alot of great advice from @realbuntyking during one of his livestreams.
7334 2018-07-10 08:44:06 Mehn scorching hot oil poured on my hand and I didn’t even feel it.
7335 2018-07-10 08:44:03 Scandinavia is in EU mostly. Norway exception has small population& HUGE oil reserves to pay generous system for its people. 

#brexit #britain is riddled with debt and huge population. How will it pay now all business is leaving. Brexit means 80% loss in Revenue from services.
7336 2018-07-10 08:44:02 Strong statement by @JeffDSachs at #HLPF2018: "greed and the vested interests of coal, oil and gas companies are the biggest obstacle to the achievement of the #SDGs". Surely the same holds true for #NDC implementation and raising ambition for transformative #climateaction.

And don't let the EU's death throws factor into the trade war being waged. God forbid we actually see the EU decentralized.

7440 2018-07-10 08:20:36 1. It may be inflationary but Indian govt should impose a heavy duty on edible oil and rubber imports from Malaysia.

2. If Indians have ANY self-respect, we should STOP going to Malaysia for holidays n Stop using Malaysian Airlines.

7448 2018-07-10 08:18:35 From now on, I suggest we refer to Robbins as 'Oily Robbins'. He's slick and, just like oil, can ooze into any cracks. Spillage, accidental or otherwise can, and will, damage the environment.
7449 2018-07-10 08:18:33 There's pushing people to do better which isn't a bad thing, I get a lot from the palm oil free community and I welcome it because they're correct, I do need to do better. Then there's outright attacks which I do not support. I've helped many vegetarians go vegan.
7450 2018-07-10 08:18:32 But He gave you people oil and made it the most important commodity on earth for a century—the same oil he gave Norway o, not a different one—what did you people do with it? Are you sure that if He gave y'all navigable rivers you would have done anything with it?

7466 2018-07-10 08:15:17 Currently best projections to keep warming "under 2 degrees" requires us to stop using oil very soon, to increase plant mass, AND sequester CO2 from the air.  The best approach that I know of involves direct CO2 capture from the air, perhaps to hydrocarbons or bound otherwise.
7467 2018-07-10 08:15:11 It was the London end of RBS that caused the failure.
Engerland benefits from all the taxes paid to WM from Scotland, of which we get a fraction back through Barnett.
Revenue from our exports goes to WM.
Our oil has been plundered for years...l could go on!!!!

7474 2018-07-10 08:13:39 Good point, Chris. My answer (in the Q&A) was based on comparing Germany (strong role of parties and public campaign finance) with the US. But of course economic clout also translates into political leverage. Oil sector in Canada, lignite in Germany.
7475 2018-07-10 08:13:38 Oh, they remembered the oil then?
7476 2018-07-10 08:13:12 @Chellaney It's sickening to see that the Palm Oil import is sought to be banned, not for health reasons, but political / religious ones. Thousands of crores of Forex outflow and lakhs falling ill. But u need a Zakir Naik to ban imports? Sickos 
7477 2018-07-10 08:12:59 Coconut oil ... Great for the skin and the hair too 
7478 2018-07-10 08:12:51 They are afraid you will concoct a bomb in the lavatory with your top notch olive oil.

7482 2018-07-10 08:11:15 Pl note, malaysian govt always taken anti India stand. Be it then denial of Quotrocci's extradition & now Jakir. 
Infact  Malaysian establishment has close proximity to Gandhi family. One option is, to put trade press by increase import duty in Palm oil &force to negotiate.
7483 2018-07-10 08:11:14 In the oil business you’d tell the driver to drive properly or pull over and let you out. I watched an Exxon guy do this in Russia once.

1. There's no such thing as too much sesame oil. Seokjin said so.
2. There's no such thing as too much garlic. I said so. But don't quote me on that.
7582 2018-07-10 07:52:22 If the best I’ve done with the same dish using animal meat is a 10, this was probably an 8. Cooks a bit differently, I think more oil read for “browning”. Less coconut cream read too.

Only maintenance is wipers and tyres. Brake pads last 100k Miles. That’s why car and oil companies don’t want you to have them!

UPA used taxpayer money to subsidise fuel so the common man isnt exploited by oil barons like Ambani

7606 2018-07-10 07:47:18 It will almost certainly be more soluble in hot oil (general solubility guidelines), but not sure if this will have any degradation effect on it.

Beyond that having a somalia on the med and all the security implications would likely draw some attention.

Putin gets his power from oil revenue. Trump's only hope of re-election is consumer spending staying at high levels.

Boycott everything tied to evil.

The number declined rapidly after that, mainly because kerosene & then electricity were better than whale oil.

7691 2018-07-10 07:28:34 Big divergence between Germany and French manufacturing in May. The latter is on track for a second consecutive q/q fall in Q2, albeit less severe compared to Q1. Big declines in energy prod and oil refining are part of the reason, but electronics prod also were weak.

7709 2018-07-10 07:23:51 It's surprising to see how few people understand that if #data is the new oil, sharing it will never be without foundational friction. #Transparency of data, as a result, is in many cases a red herring.

There's a need to fundamentally rethink the model.
7710 2018-07-10 07:23:51 I was expecting something light. No oil type.

7715 2018-07-10 07:23:00 I thought mustard oil would not be nice, but it was absolutely brilliant with a simple Amla curry by @mayurirk. And the Hilsa Curry recipe, I have used with small sardines & silver fish. My sisters say its my best fish curry so far. Want to try it with Lady Fish or Kane.

End of 18th century < 1 billion people on earth.
Today > 7 billion.
The energy needs of a bigger and richer global population have risen sixfold in the past 50 years.
Almost 90%!!! of that energy is provided by fossil fuels – coal, gas and oil...
7754 2018-07-10 07:14:48 Mct oil is a heaps better option
7755 2018-07-10 07:14:32 Try it and see. The best is coconut oil.  it can solve every problem.
7756 2018-07-10 07:14:15 The plan is to export it. We already have a generous domestic supply of associated gas thanks to tight oil production, which is why AB is weaning itself off thermal coal. It's a good thing.

7770 2018-07-10 07:12:21 By far the grossest part of this oil junk is that it's warm when I can finally swallow it. It makes sense it would be from sitting under my tongue for 90 seconds but I HATE warm liquid and just that sensation makes me gag every time.

7839 2018-07-10 07:01:28 MS OGWAL: Mr Speaker, is it in order for the honourable chairperson to misquote me by saying that I recommended that oil is not only an advantage to women but also to men?  #Hansard2018
7840 2018-07-10 07:01:27 MR MUSASIZI: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your wise ruling. Lastly, I would like to comment about the cooking oil tax proposal of Shs 200 per litre. Cooking oil, like hon. Cecilia Ogwal said, is not only for women. This is oil used for cooking for both men and women... #Hansard2018
7841 2018-07-10 07:01:23 ...Therefore, for the men to say the oil should be taxed is to say that women should struggle more to make money and make the men healthy. We want to cook very good food for our husbands and we even want to participate in this trade... #Hansard2018
7842 2018-07-10 07:01:22 ...Therefore, is it in order for the Leader of the Opposition to continue saying that taxing oil would disadvantage women when it is actually the men who would be disadvantaged? (Laughter) #Hansard2018
7843 2018-07-10 07:01:21 ...Therefore, the men are the ones who are going to benefit most and I would expect the men in this House to support the idea that oil should not be taxed. This is because if the women do not cook well, then we are in trouble... #Hansard2018
7844 2018-07-10 07:01:21 キャリアオイルの種類・椿油/カメリアオイル / Camellia oil
ツバキ科、種子。ホホバオイルとオリーブオイルと共に、世界の3大オイル。85%以上がオレイン酸。保湿、肌を柔らかくする。浸透力は優れている。ヘアケアに最適。使い心地はやや粘性があり、滑らか。酸化しにくい。
7845 2018-07-10 07:01:21 MS OGWAL: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition is emphasising that taxing oil would disadvantage women but it is the other way round. If the women do not use cooking oil for their husbands, many of them are going to be divorced... #Hansard2018
7846 2018-07-10 07:00:51 And why is that more than likely?  Because black people don’t like 45 because he is racist?  At least your admitting it. I’m Latina and I don’t have any issues with black people in general. Your statement drips with stereotypes and racism.

7858 2018-07-10 06:59:11 Water and oil aren't soluble, so the water sinks to the bottom and becomes vapor. Remeber, water expands with heat, so it pushes the oil out and expands the fire.
7859 2018-07-10 06:59:09 それだと地の色が表に出ないほど染めなくちゃいけないわけだから、二度塗りとか三度塗りとかが必要になってくるはずです。

つまり、前の塗りが乾くまで次の塗りができないので、採取した染料を保存するか、グループ別に採取をずらして生かしておくかしなければならず、「その場」は難しいと思います。

7870 2018-07-10 06:56:50 Ok, without getting dragged into a discussion over whether Scotland should be independent, Oil is by no means Britains only export, not even close.
7871 2018-07-10 06:56:33 Buying a souvenir on a week-long school trip to Ancient Roman sites. Said souvenir broke in my luggage on the way home & I was so embarrassed that I made up an elaborate story of buying a broken oil lamp bc it was more authentic.

7874 2018-07-10 06:55:38 You don't build a refinery when you do not have oil, You should not rear cattle when your terrain is unfavorable for grass and herbs to grow or thrive. Change your business in respect to the resources you have. You can't be rearing cattle when u don't have grass to feed them.

7880 2018-07-10 06:54:15 Whao! When you look at Dubai, Norway etc and how they have grown because of oil. Then look at Scotland with the top 20 areas of poverty we have Westminster to thank for retaining fiscal leavers we need to improve our country. Indy is the only way now.
7881 2018-07-10 06:54:01 Who else actually enjoys natural peanut butter, where u have to mix the oil in? Bc that’s the only kind I eat tbh.

8045 2018-07-10 06:24:38 The skill when coal was the fuel was making the boiler, when oil became the fuel the skill became more about the control of the flame, developed by those such as grandad. Gas quickly took hold and with the inherited knowledge of flame control the skill became sales

8106 2018-07-10 06:15:31 Bhp billiton. Looks as if they will be selling USA onshore oil business for  $12bn. Cannot spend this and debt already low so I would think that a big dividend or share buyback is on the cards relatively soon.

8111 2018-07-10 06:13:51 North Sea oil pays her wages
8112 2018-07-10 06:13:49 We need to render oil useless. It's a threat to all life on Earth. the only reason we don't switch to solar is because oil is so profitable now. Humans can prosper under a different system. this one is failing them and the planet. It serves the interests of corporations, not us.

8117 2018-07-10 06:12:15 Lol that was a silly issue that like 100 people had a problem with. They were claiming that it's unsafe for the environment, when in reality pipes are far safe way to transport crude oil than trucks or ships. Something like $190 mill was paid to the reservation owners.
8118 2018-07-10 06:12:09 I ask again why is Lagos the only functional deep sea port in #OneNigeria? & Why do Yorubas share absolute monopoly of Biafra oil with fulanis? #TheseAreHardFactsNotHate! #BiafraOrDeath!! #IPOB #BiafraExit!

8136 2018-07-10 06:07:07 Oil prices rose on escalating concerns over potential supply shortages, with Brent crude leading the way as hundreds of oil workers in Norway were set to strike later in the day.

Also that doesn't mean you eat ONLY pasta. 

As you don't eat only olive oil. 

We eat meals, not bowls of pasta.
8141 2018-07-10 06:05:41 i mean PLANT!! it's an older definition of essential but that's basically what it means - the most concentrated essence of the plant = the essential oil of the plant!

8178 2018-07-10 05:59:56 Total cost to "fuel" our 3200 mile #greatelectricroadtrip was $92.48. 

If I had been driving a 35 mpg car (like my hybrid), gas would have cost over $250. Also, no need for an oil change after those 3200 miles. I'd say driving electric saved a bundle. Thanks, @Tesla & @elonmusk!
8179 2018-07-10 05:59:37 In the pot, put a little bit of oil, enough to coat all the pasta you put in but not so much that it accumulates in the pot. Lol. Keep the pot at medium to low heat  until the oil heats up and then pour in the pasta. Stir every so often so that it browns but doesn’t burn.

8247 2018-07-10 05:45:55 Aaaaaaaah you need the oil!!!! It’s amazing. You could seriously use pounds of it & your hair will never feel heavy. You can use it w/dry hair too for flyaways & smoothing out your hair after styling!! {not that I ever fucking do my hair but it’s a nice option to have lmao}

8288 2018-07-10 05:38:20 I don’t know how people lived there? 
In the oil rig machine parks it can reach 60 degrees centigrade. (140f) I’m not sure how anyone got near enough to measure it?
8289 2018-07-10 05:37:42 1) Economically, lower domestic oil consumption=lower global prices=less power for oil-dependent countries. 
2) Almost every policy can be spun with "national security" justification because there is no objective standard for what it means. There has to be a limit on this.
8290 2018-07-10 05:37:18 My mother is 84 & she got the oil from my niece & she’s been in heaven ever since. She wants me to try it with her & I was scared I’d get paranoid, but my friend MR promised me I wouldn’t so I’m going to give it a try.

8300 2018-07-10 05:34:55 Finance and real estate make up almost as much as oil and gas by GDP.
8301 2018-07-10 05:34:50 Thats very dangerous. In Nigeria people were burnt to ashes when the oil they were harvesting from a burst pipeline suddenly caught fire. But then what can we expect , its Mushikashika time.
8302 2018-07-10 05:34:44 Currently there are 7 countries running almost at 100% renewable or close to it. What is lacking is the political will. What is in the way are oil company lobbyists.
8303 2018-07-10 05:34:42 Tom Brady’s diet is mostly vegan (80% veggies and whole grain like quinoa) with the exception of lean meat. No GMOs, iodized salt, white sugar or flour, caffeine, olive oil (not for cooking), dairy, or fruit (occasional banana in his smoothie)

8315 2018-07-10 05:31:49 There is no way that budget is getting balanced without a sales tax. Spending less and smarter will help, however we must be realistic about this.  We are never going to see 2010-14 kind of oil revenue again, cutting the waste won’t get us there, we have to change as a Province

8323 2018-07-10 05:30:00 HOOK’s on the record briefing last week made no mention of phasing sanctions in. He said only that the goal was zero revenues from crude oil sales. Oil and banking are re-imposed on Nov 4. And they are not looking to grant waivers.

8334 2018-07-10 05:28:26 Why not begin planting oil palms in arid area. It does not need much irrigation & can give profit to dry land farming farmers, obviate need of diverting water from drinking to agriculture use and save foreign exchange bringing Malasia to knees.
8335 2018-07-10 05:28:17 Paul Oquist is just a sad snake oil salesman. He is in denial of the seriousness of the Human Rights violations against the protestors. He works for a sociopath couple that believe they own Nicaragua.

8382 2018-07-10 05:16:49 I just did mine today, and she told me not to use coconut oil because it draws the pigment out. She said avocado was fine when I asked. Glad I did, because I would totally have used coconut otherwise.

8384 2018-07-10 05:16:40 The government is not offering tenders for offshore oil and gas exploration, but is keeping land based Taranaki exploration, plus not cancelling any offshore expliration licenses already issued . That is not 'pulling the rug from under the Taranaki oil and gas industry.

8395 2018-07-10 05:14:12 Amendments upon getting home and seeing the book: it's 425; you coat it with oil, not just drizzle; and it's 20-25 minutes.  Lastly, add some salt.
8396 2018-07-10 05:14:09 Not all Cannabis oils are the same... be sure your taking the right version. Rick Simpson's is not the same a CBD. Fluid Essential Oil type is not the same as the thick dark green gooey kind.

8400 2018-07-10 05:13:55 I think the best kept secret is the topical serum (liquid oil form). It literally starts reducing the inflammation in the cut/wound/scratch within a day or 2 of applying directly.

8451 2018-07-10 05:03:57 I use the dove sensitive skin bar  every other night and coconut oil everyday for a moisturizer. Just a suggestion
8452 2018-07-10 05:03:54 It’s so cold, even the coconut oil demands foreplay before use. #banting #bulletcoffee #winter
8453 2018-07-10 05:03:53 Oh no. The bolt was holding my flex plate to the torque converter so to get a better angle on it I decided to just take off my intake manifold and oil pressure sensor. With that I was able to get a perfectly flat direct line on it and my impact got it off pretty quickly.
8454 2018-07-10 05:03:52 It is very true. Oil and gas and its derivatives is a main economic activity. There will be no expansions as has been publicly stated. Contact within industry told me staff attrition already happening. Council asked for $34mill to explore economic alternatives. Clear enough to me
8455 2018-07-10 05:03:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

8458 2018-07-10 05:03:42 I think any tarrif imposed on Malaysian Palm oil import would be counterproductive for India as China is coddling up, already, with the former to ensure Chinese influence in that country.

8501 2018-07-10 04:55:36 I'm not rich, but the people in my life right now are more valuable than they know. I feel like I struck oil, but I'd never tell 'em. They'd just brush it off. They deserve medals. All of 'em.
8502 2018-07-10 04:55:35 Yes it's a nice thing having a bunch of centers who can move to the wings. Im sure the Oil could work out a trade like Nuge + Lucic fir Drouin + Max P + a 1st + Price + Weber with salary retained of course.

8520 2018-07-10 04:51:29 :o it's like a deep fryer, but you don't use oil to fry! it's like this vortex of hot air that fries the food. i tried it earlier on egg rolls and the skins came out crispy BUT NO GREASY OUTSIDE!!! apparently you can bake in it, too??
8521 2018-07-10 04:51:13 We are slowly loosing our culture in Zambia, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating vitumbuwa instead of rubbing the oil on his head. Ala mwebantu the way i was hurt
8522 2018-07-10 04:50:18 Medically speaking, Palm oil is bad for health. Compared to all other cooking oils it is the worst actually.

8539 2018-07-10 04:47:53 Burning your finger with oil RIGHT BEFORE DINNER SERVICE?! God damn I love that sensational feeling when I’m dropping food in a deep fryer afterwards
8540 2018-07-10 04:47:51 speculators on the world market to blame. Any news story keeps it up. NK or China trade. By the end of the year USA will be producing more oil than anyone! But we have NO deep water ports! No port a super tanker can pull into. all filled off shore. Slow!

8545 2018-07-10 04:46:44 This isn't really impacting OPEC nations, but it is hurting our capability to produce oil for ourselves. it has been used as an excuse to stop people from fracking in remote locations and drilling for oil because the people invested in alternate energy are very powerful.
8546 2018-07-10 04:46:02 Apparently a lot of their hair care and face care items contain avocado or avocado oil which is unfortuante considering I was there to get hair care and face care items.

8547 2018-07-10 04:45:40 TO PAY THEM BACK!!! The oil finally ran out… the crime of L.A. This Side of Trogar? Born to be young.
8548 2018-07-10 04:45:33 Climate change has been used as a pretext to stop things the oil pipelines, it's pushed hard by people that are invested in solar, wind and hydro power because big oil affects their bottom line.
8549 2018-07-10 04:45:31 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8550 2018-07-10 04:45:27 Mr. President, the price of oil has been rising, which has greatly increased the cost of living for our middle class. Do you want to help us solve this problem？
8551 2018-07-10 04:45:24 Thankfully I need an oil change anyway so hopefully it's and easy "place sensor back in socket" type fix lol
8552 2018-07-10 04:45:15 I like my outback but it’s too small for huge roads. Should I sell all my cars and invest in 18 wheelers? Additional info: driving is only a hobby, I don’t have a licence, I’m already hugely in dept & I refuse to pay for oil, gas or brake fluid. Should I buy boats??
8553 2018-07-10 04:44:56 yeah i’m doing that. It does help immensely but I still can’t get enough fat. I need to like mainline olive oil or something
8554 2018-07-10 04:44:49 I can’t believe i forgot to tweet abt this because it’s probably the most ok brand thing to happen to me all month. I bought cbd oil at the pharmacy and the dude asked what symptoms it’s for so I said “anxiety” and he explained everything and I paid, blah blah blah
8555 2018-07-10 04:44:26 He’s setting the curve you have to drill down to a 240/60 min chart. Even then for oil it’s going to be for the big players
8556 2018-07-10 04:44:25 Gotta splash a little baby oil in your bath. I'm silky as fuck right now.
8557 2018-07-10 04:43:42 Hi Greg, I follow all your tweets.  You have a knack of hitting the nail on the head. This one is a real head scratcher (well not really), especially when all those bleeding heart Hollywood stars come all the way up to Canada to try to shut our oil industry down.  Wonder why...

8577 2018-07-10 04:40:22 Where did they finally admit this?
Their plan has always been to delay the transition to renewable energy, to satisfy their Big Oil party donors. It's the same as the CPC's "Made in Canada" plan to replace Kyoto that never materialized, it doesn't exist and never will.

親が金持ちだから勉強に超お金をかけられる

8665 2018-07-10 04:26:06 They're so good grilled, although high heat on a griddle works well if you can't cook outside. Just some olive oil & salt is good, but I guess they'd be good with other flavors too if you like (maybe a little garlic, cumin or mint?) Also zucchini bread is always delicious!

8667 2018-07-10 04:25:58 but if you put water in your oil filter your car over heats.
if you extract a trillion square feet of Petroleum
the planet probably overheats.

8700 2018-07-10 04:21:01 Silly.  Loved in Washington.  LOVED by big Oil, lobbyists and mega billionaire corporate interests over their workers.  Loved by Wall street and every major polluter of our drinking water. The media reports the facts.  "Hate" has nothing to do with anything.  American citizens?
8701 2018-07-10 04:20:44 Its so sad the so called south south & Niger delta have been so hypnotized by Yoruba's razzmatazz & cannot see. Corrupt #Yoruba hold sway in the oil companies & oil servicing firms in alliance with #Fulanis.

8705 2018-07-10 04:20:04 I know, I tweeted with a hasty broad brush. And yet, the $$$ from the oil seem to prevent so many from accepting the truth about global warming and pollution.
8706 2018-07-10 04:20:03 I use hairspray on spiders, because I'm a freaky tree hugger who wont use poison. sorry about the canola oil, and uhm...the bug sprays not next to the stove, is it?
8707 2018-07-10 04:20:01 Fresh water aquifers are scrupulously protected by state and federal regulations. Drilling though aquifers is tightly monitored; and sealed off from oil & gas production by double layers of cemented steel casings.
Over 2 million wells and no instances of fracking problems.
8708 2018-07-10 04:19:54 Man, I dump on the Oil, and lord knows they've earned it, but the Sens are as big a shitshow as the Yotes or Thrashers were. They have 3 decent vets left (EK, Stone, Duchene) and all of them could well be gone by the next trade deadline. Couldn't imagine buying season tickets.

8716 2018-07-10 04:19:05 Oh please! The Harper govt spent plenty of taxpayers $ on focus groups & advertising. Like 9 million in 2013 on advertising for the NR sector (ie big oil). Oh yeah & several 100k to rename the National Parole Board to Parole Board of Canada. Totally worth it! Pft! They ALL do it.

8740 2018-07-10 04:16:24 Just got banned from a twitch channel because I mentioned rapeseed oil during a discussion about cooking with another viewer. Figured I may have got autobopped and tried whispering the streamer. Got the response "You should be fucking ashamed of yourself for using that word."
8741 2018-07-10 04:16:09 Saw an interesting piece of bit of advice for cooking with Kale - you double the amount of olive oil used because that makes it easier to slide  toff your plate and straight into the bin! ;-)

8808 2018-07-10 04:06:30 Putin wants to sell his oil again. Trump is the key that and all those clandestine meetings were about that, not okay. Not okay to give away israeli assets to the Russians while discussing firing our FBI director to get out of an uncomfortable investigation. Criminal

8810 2018-07-10 04:06:00 It’s a shame that the shampoo didn’t work for you.  You must have naturally oily hair! We have worked this out and we will be launching the argan oil shampoo’s newest formula (and more reliable packaging ) in a couple of weeks.

8813 2018-07-10 04:05:53 Congress did not pay for the purchased oil from 2009 and the value was 1.4 lac crores with another 40 thousand crores as interest .So Modi has payed back the debt .it's a idiotism for Congress to do this nonsense.I can share the videos of @PiyushGoyal  if u want

8818 2018-07-10 04:05:02 found myself buying oil for my car (turns out, it was pretty close to empty, which also would have resulted in thousands' worth of engine damage), some more food, caulk for the many cracks in the walls, and a hair-dryer. All this, and just when I thought I had finally 3/?

8825 2018-07-10 04:03:19 If well stimulations communicate with water formations (salty or fresh) the oil & gas wells are ruined. Fresh water aquifers are usually a mile shallower than petroleum target formations. No one fracks a mile high, out of zone (very hard to do and 10x the size & cost).
8826 2018-07-10 04:02:50 The rest of the world needs oil to bring them to civilization. Your not only hurting western workers with your logic but u impede and give the death sentence to billions of others cuz of poor ideas like green energy.
8827 2018-07-10 04:02:50 Hobi is the ult dom and y’all really out here not picking him in the year of our Lord 2018?? Let me go get my holy oil because y’all got spirits in you

8834 2018-07-10 04:02:25 Try it with coconut oil, little more bearable.  I couldn’t do it with the butter.
8835 2018-07-10 04:02:17 Interesting to understand that the current oil prices aren't the result of economic issues but of geopolitical issues.

8856 2018-07-10 03:59:11 Using your argument we had decreased growth & investment because of the contraction

Comparing GDP now to $70+ oil then w/o considering factors like cap invest & skilled labour rates is inaccurate

8933 2018-07-10 03:48:53 Again with the growth take your own advice and look at other sources of economic metrics. We have growth because of the contraction we had. If you want a fair comparison look at our GDP now compared to the last time oil was over 70$ a barrel.

8936 2018-07-10 03:48:17 CBD oil has a wide range of health benefits. Hemp seeds are a superfood packed with healthy fat that can benefit the heart. Hemp fibers are biodegradable, they can be used to make paper and plastic products.

8947 2018-07-10 03:47:04 Food giant Nestlé lost its sustainable certification & will no longer be able to claim its products contain certified sustainable palm oil.
8948 2018-07-10 03:47:02 SK, I’m blocked to pretend I don’t answer tweets. I wonder why he can’t just talk to “knuckle draggers” man to man. Venezuela/California produce even heavier crudes as near surface higher temperatures reduce oil’s viscosity. No BC knuckle dragger or greenpiece protesters there!
8949 2018-07-10 03:46:41 if your just  starting keto skip the mct oil. it can be an irritant to the stomach.
8950 2018-07-10 03:46:31 Gin and tonics make me feel things and also taste like CBD oil and i hate it wassup let’s text
8951 2018-07-10 03:46:30 Y isn't coconut oil a substitute
8952 2018-07-10 03:46:27 Classic oil trash pic love it
8953 2018-07-10 03:46:27 After you make a sandwich, pick up a six pack, and wear those heart stopping boy shorts.  Feet will be washed, and rubbed.  Lotion or oil?
8954 2018-07-10 03:46:17 Oil prices rose on escalating concerns over potential supply shortages, with Brent  leading the way as hundreds of oil workers in Norway were set to strike later in the day. The workers on Norwegian oil offshore rigs are due to strike after rejecting a proposed wage deal. #oott
8955 2018-07-10 03:46:13 Why are these people so damn afraid? Why let these snake oil salesmen treat them in this manner?
8956 2018-07-10 03:45:52 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8957 2018-07-10 03:45:47 早くね？？？
8958 2018-07-10 03:45:35 世界中が科学技術に大金かけてるんだから日本も見習って欲しい。

8960 2018-07-10 03:45:22 so many spiders at our place... john just sprayed our place w peppermint oil. it would be some shit if it actually attracted spiders/other insects instead lol 
8961 2018-07-10 03:45:21 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
8962 2018-07-10 03:45:18 What? I assumed a ban on oil consumption (foreign or otherwise) would lead to a decrease in imports, not exports. What country in the Middle East imports our exported oil?
8963 2018-07-10 03:45:18 Nigeria is arguably worse. GDP has grown ten fold since 2000 but it all goes to government and their family. Somehow nigeria has the highest poverty rate and lowest percent of kids in school despite highest 20 year gdp growth rate. I work for an oil company complicit in this
8964 2018-07-10 03:45:13 You're right. Maybe reducing domestic oil consumption has only 90% of the impacts of reducing imports.
8965 2018-07-10 03:44:58 Wouldn't it be ironic if Popeye's chicken is fried in olive oil?
;-)
8966 2018-07-10 03:44:50 I do this work for a living: mapping the extent of hydraulic fracture induced drainage networks, and detecting/mapping petroleum deposits from trace petroleum in soil and water samples.
Well stimulations effect only oil & gas bering formations a mile or more below aquifers.
8967 2018-07-10 03:44:30 Pepper was knocked out the whole time from the oil rig to the location of the other SHIELD building location. It was only when they had put her into a secure holding cell that she started to come to. At first she didn't realize what had happened until it all suddenly -
8968 2018-07-10 03:44:27 or should I just get rosehip oil / jojoba oil
8969 2018-07-10 03:44:23 I bet 90% of them can't name 5 SCOTUS justices.
8970 2018-07-10 03:44:03 it tastes better with cinnamon and a little coconut oil too instead of straight butter
8971 2018-07-10 03:43:37 Add some chicken, the oil from their meat makes good broth for the ramen
8972 2018-07-10 03:43:33 And it isn't even true that oil is a fully global commodity given that oil from different places goes for different prices on the market.
8973 2018-07-10 03:43:06 Peppermint Oil seems to be the only thing that helps my massive daily sinus headaches. Anyone else suffering?
8974 2018-07-10 03:43:02 If they won the 2008 election where not even a drop of cooking oil was there in the supermarket what of now and why now
8975 2018-07-10 03:43:02 I see why people swear by Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I’ve been using it on my eyebrows for two weeks and see them getting back to normal after like a year of them not growing back from a horrible wax job.
8976 2018-07-10 03:43:00 If you don’t know you need an oil change for your car you shouldn’t be driving. . Most drivers understand this
8977 2018-07-10 03:42:42 Use a nail to start her I lost the key don't paid on mine that whirring sound she use a little oil but outside of that she cherry
8978 2018-07-10 03:42:29 仕事ごっこへの指摘に関しては耳にいたい部分があるな
8979 2018-07-10 03:42:20 #LoopholesAmbani 
Ambu's n Modi's never did business just found out loopholes in our law and interpreted according to Convenience by buying Electoral Bonds 
Krishna Godavari basin he digged loopholes not oil and gas!!
8980 2018-07-10 03:42:10 毎月10日は『植物油の日』

日本植物油協会が1994年に制定。

元々は 『710』 を180度回転させると 『OIL』 に見えるということで7月10日だけだったが、後に10=テン→テンプラ油→植物油という連想で毎月10日の記念日となった。
8981 2018-07-10 03:42:06 My gringo is showing when I tell you that my condiment for fish is usually dill relish (vlasic) and kraft olive oil mayo....I do love pico de gallo however
8982 2018-07-10 03:42:05 We would just export less oil and they would fill in the gap. Textbook resource shuffling. Little to no change in final financial flows and production.
8983 2018-07-10 03:42:05 Now let's make a list of the most dangerous ones from the right (and their accomplices)
1) Rebekah Mercer and her dad
2)  The Saudi royal family
3) Putin
4) Rupert Murdoch
5) Any oil barrons
8984 2018-07-10 03:41:53 Not enough Godfather content focuses on the fact that they're olive oil manufacturers
8985 2018-07-10 03:41:43 Like not knowing things in life can definitely harm you for Example.. you didn’t know that if you don’t put oil in your car, your car will be fine but ultimately that bitch going to be fucked up.

9000 2018-07-10 03:40:11 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9001 2018-07-10 03:40:11 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9005 2018-07-10 03:39:28 Venezuela's problem is that the government became socialist, took over oil, and then ruined the entire economy. Venezuela should be the richest south American country. Instead, it is a complete utter disaster thanks to socialism.
9006 2018-07-10 03:39:26 Me complaining to Aaron: "How in the world did I get all these wrinkles"? Thinks back to all those times in 7th grade dumping an entire bottle of baby oil on myself at the pool. Me: "I just don't get it"

9013 2018-07-10 03:38:16 They only get money from us because we import their oil; if we didn't, money, the only national security problem, wouldn't flow from us to them.

OILを半回転させると710に見えることから。
9015 2018-07-10 03:37:46 A spicy yet acidic Grenache with a subtle hint of sesame oil.
9016 2018-07-10 03:37:41 Well the big issue in our country is the drug issue (it's suprisingly high) estimated about 1.8 millions drug users, the destruction of the city called marawi because of Isis and rebuilding it, still persistent traffic and rising of oil and electric charges.
9017 2018-07-10 03:37:33 OILの 日でも あるみたいですよ

710を  ひっくり返すと OIL だそうな。。

9028 2018-07-10 03:35:50 It’s a fish oil supplement my guy, some of my pills r twice that size
9029 2018-07-10 03:35:37 It’s difficult also when there’s Pharma, Food industries, oil, coal, and every other industry out to become even more rich, funding people for their own agendas. How’s an average good willed person supposed to compete with that?
9030 2018-07-10 03:35:36 Oil prices gain on supply concerns in Iran, Libya, Canada: Oil prices gained on Monday, with U.S. crude ending a choppy session higher on expectations for a Canadian production outage lasting until September, while global benchmark Brent gained on looming sanctions on Iran and…
9031 2018-07-10 03:35:28 Not only are Washington's trade wars damaging to the US economy, but anticipated higher oil prices resulting from anti-Iranian sanctions will only make its economic matters worse. America's war on the world is only accelerating its own decline.
9032 2018-07-10 03:35:28 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue

9038 2018-07-10 03:35:03 "Senators should put partisanship aside in consideration of this nominee"

If my hatred of McConnell could be harnessed into energy, I alone could solve our nation's oil import problem right now.
9039 2018-07-10 03:35:01 Alllll ma avocado oil choway 
9040 2018-07-10 03:34:53 @baratza I've had zero static issues with 7 Sette Series grinders I've had since the late prototypes. That includes 2 270Ws, 3 270s, 1 270Wi, and 1 30. Not sure why you are having it, but nb, super dark roasts can cause static problems (gummy oil buildup too) in ALL grinders.
9041 2018-07-10 03:34:46 Bad take. Oil is a global commodity. All oil consumption empowers Middle East theocracies, not just our physical imports.
9042 2018-07-10 03:34:17 Now after this good morning I ll have to drive my way to office and get harassed by rickshaws, bikes, mini local vans, oil tankers and overload buses. 
Believe me being a man isn't easy as well
9043 2018-07-10 03:34:14 My ex best friend’s mom posted that her dog was going crazy over the eucalyptus oil and I was like OMFG HES GOING TO DIE YOU FOOL
9044 2018-07-10 03:34:05 MCT oil bruh.
9045 2018-07-10 03:34:04 Out of curiosity, what do you loathe about it? If done wrong, the texture can be really off-putting if there's too much oil involved or if it's way overcooked. Undercooking isn't much better. If you're curious, try 1/2" rounds on the grill with light oil and S&P til soft-ish.
9046 2018-07-10 03:34:00 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
9047 2018-07-10 03:33:58 ใจเย็นนะเม 5555
9048 2018-07-10 03:33:44 It's hard to find a snack food not loaded with palm oil in much of SE Asia.

Just have to stay a little healthier I guess!?
9049 2018-07-10 03:33:44 Putin wants to invade the Canadian North too. Weaken US and Canadian relationship. Get access to ports in the Artic. Oil. Shipping lanes. Russia is flexing its muscles in the North.
9050 2018-07-10 03:33:44 Cooking hack Pro Tip:  

Mayonnaise whether it be Vegin or eggbased makes a great browning agent. Sub it in for butter or cocoa nut oil.
9051 2018-07-10 03:33:34 I can get your car cleaned and your oil changed at my job

9054 2018-07-10 03:33:18 ARTIST TIP: if you have oil pastel on your hands, make sure you wash it off before you spray any fixative on your piece, because if you get the fixative on your hands over top the oil pastel, it’s gross and really hard to get off :-(
9055 2018-07-10 03:33:07 Yeah it helped all those ducks in the golf you know those oil spill ducks?
9056 2018-07-10 03:32:57 We use oil, red wine vinegar, dry mustard, sugar, lemon juice and some crushed garlic.  I could eat with this with lettuce every day all summer.

9061 2018-07-10 03:31:56 I had to buy some kerosene cans last winter when i accidentally ran short of heating oil and they couldn't deliver for 2 days the damn nozzles were useless and i almost broke my hand trying to make it work LOL thankfully i didnt break my hand
9062 2018-07-10 03:31:36 Just some general advice for all my Mac users out there: If you spill Olive Oil on your keyboard and you take it to the Genuis Bar for repairs and they tell you everything is fine because it wasn’t water, they are lying to you. Everything IS. NOT. FINE
9063 2018-07-10 03:31:28 There is no documented case of hydraulic fracturing stimulation contaminating aquifers.
On the other hand it is extremely common for fresh water to carry traces of naturally occurring oil & gas seepage from petroleum deposits, whether or not those deposits are produced.
9064 2018-07-10 03:31:25 This morning I put a few drops of tea tree oil in my face wash and did a charcoal face mask right after.... Never again. My face is just now clearing up from the hell I put it through. I deserved it
9065 2018-07-10 03:31:07 Just purchased some x brand from bto, levers from works connection, and tomorrow ordeing some oil from Maxima. 
9066 2018-07-10 03:31:02 My mom was one of them the doctors told her to take catrol oil with me and she said it didn't do anything but cause the worse cramping pain she had ever felt and diarrhea.  She said she sat on the toilet for hours and it did no good as far as helping start labor.
9067 2018-07-10 03:30:50 Benz needs an oil change. About to do this myself for under $40. Watch me work.
9068 2018-07-10 03:30:42 if you’re not moisturizing with oil wtf is the point man?
9069 2018-07-10 03:30:35 Little update last week I got stung by some invisible bug, got a second degree burn from Hot Pocket cheese falling onto my boob, burnt my hand on oil at work & got in a minor car accident after that  I feel like you

I think he was Oil Minister before so not “new” and thus not a ‘bad idea’ per se
9080 2018-07-10 03:28:47 What we need is a rethink of long distance transportation that considers it a public service, rather than a private profit opportunity. I have a hard time understanding how a federal gov't can nationalize a dirty oil pipeline and not utter a peep about long distance bus services.
9081 2018-07-10 03:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

9083 2018-07-10 03:27:41 They are afraid of your straight forward personality. Only intelligent people understand President Trump’s strategy. Time to drop OPEC for Hemp oil and make States independent economically with dropping Federal Marijuana Laws and Classifications. Keep up the Great Work!
9084 2018-07-10 03:27:38 Peppermint oil! Ants/bugs don’t like it and it makes the house smell great!

9236 2018-07-10 03:02:53 On the contrary I have spoken many times about expensive foreign oil. The KM pipeline, which is currently being hotly debated right now, is exporting oil out of the country, so Canadian continues to buy expensive oil. We also export oil to US, then import expensive gas from them.
9237 2018-07-10 03:02:48 A thin coat of crisco oil on the marble floor outside RBG's office might move things along...
9238 2018-07-10 03:02:48 Idk LOL. it’s super easy... you get cake or pancake better(mix it of course).. any flavor.. put it in a ziplock and snip the end... put hot oil in a pan and swirl that bit as you’re pouring it from the bag lol.. get some confectioners sugar.. and BOOM. Funnel cake

9240 2018-07-10 03:02:29 Anyone know how to get oil stains out of fabric ?
9241 2018-07-10 03:01:54 There is no such report from oil ministry. It is only part of yellow journalism.
9242 2018-07-10 03:01:39 When you leave your oil pen at work  bitch now I have to wait till tomorrow to hit it .. 
9243 2018-07-10 03:01:38 อ้อสนใจฟรี รอคิวนะคะ อย่าเร่ง รำคาญ มีแต่พวกรอผ่าน คนเราต้องกินข้าว ไม่สามารถ อยู่ด้วยการกินน้ำลายทุกวัน
9244 2018-07-10 03:01:31 Boogie, keep in mind that cbd uptake is affected by body weight. The more body fat, the more you need. I'm a moderately sized dude and oil doesnt work for me. You might need something like an isolate or to smoke some actual cbd flower to get your desired results.
9245 2018-07-10 03:01:25 My eye lids are so soft from the coconut oil I’ve been putting on for my sunburn
9246 2018-07-10 03:01:18 So my luck this week: interview had me waiting dumb long, another interview the people just left and didn’t wait the time they told me, another interview tomorrow. Then car hose exploded which made my car overheat. Piece for my powe brakes cracked and broke off. Extreme oil leak.
9247 2018-07-10 03:01:04 put the little toilet paper square (or cotton ball) (whatever) tilt the bottle on it. put your "cloth" over the mouth of the tea tree oil bottle and tump it upside down.  DAB it on
9248 2018-07-10 03:00:58 NYC is like one of those shit machines that sit on your table like a seesaw with blue oil water, and your trapped inside, and you think the oil might be cool to be friends with or maybe the blue dye or maybe the water but that's all wrong answer is D all of the above are assholes
9249 2018-07-10 03:00:52 Tea tree oil
9250 2018-07-10 03:00:52 My parents and I are sitting in the living room comparing medical marijuana oil flavors, and my mom stares me right in the eyes and said “who knew I’d support a family of pot heads” and idk what to tell her

9255 2018-07-10 03:00:21 Soften dry hair: Heat a half cup olive oil (don’t boil it), apply to your hair. Let it set for 45 minutes, then shampoo and thoroughly rinse
9256 2018-07-10 03:00:16 Because waiting around in a parking lot for a tow truck is exactly how I wanted to spend my night. Thanks, mother, for not changing your oil in 9 months and wasting my night coming to save your ass.
She's lucky I love her.
9257 2018-07-10 03:00:14 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil...

Humans are Mammals. 
9259 2018-07-10 02:59:20 My ex almost burnt his motor out because he didn't know you had to check the oil between changes. He also wouldn't take our truck in when I told him the transmission was going (it would have been w/in warranty) instead he waited and it was in time but just over mileage
9260 2018-07-10 02:59:06 Kirk just yelled at me to get an oil change. Calm down dad.
9261 2018-07-10 02:59:04 American exploited cheap labour and looted oil from Middle East by attacking countries made USA a world power

9264 2018-07-10 02:58:33 Mom: put coconut oil in your hair 
Me: I’m good it’s gonna look oily 
Mom: IF YOU DONT PUT COCONUT OIL IN YOUR HAIR YOU ARENT GONNA HAVE ANY HAIR 
9265 2018-07-10 02:58:33 Apparently we’re living in a time where an Attorney General provides a statement on something as innocuous as CBD oil, throwing merchants and citizens lives into chaos.
9266 2018-07-10 02:58:26 90.1 for the soul
9267 2018-07-10 02:58:21 Serious question:  Why do you think pipelines don’t help?  Because I think if a train produces CO while transporting oil and pipelines don’t, then one could argue that they do indeed help.
9268 2018-07-10 02:58:20 Who the hell wakes up one morning & goes "I'm going to build oil & gas reserves in the middle of the fucking ocean,"? Why?
9269 2018-07-10 02:58:04 I can’t help but admire people that have the courage to buy ALTs today.  They are the same people that would drill an oil well in the 1930’s before their was good technology.
9270 2018-07-10 02:57:43 ごめんなさい(´・ω・｀)Twitter大荒れしてました。もう落ち着いたんで、
9271 2018-07-10 02:57:36 @narendramodi This strategy must be adopted by India. We have been soft and not assertive in many matters including this. If we stop importing palm oil, it will help our farmers to earn more and will be an incentive too.
9272 2018-07-10 02:57:12 With Exxon's global track record, it is perfectly understandable. And that's not considering the fact or not that the oil giant took advantage (if you want to call it that) of Guyana in the initial contract negotiations related to the oil developments.

We are the producer of the radiator,hydraulic oil cooler and intercooler for excavator,dozer,loaders.Our heat exchangers are mainly forCAT,Volvo,Komatsu,Kobelco,Hitachi,Kubota,Sumitomo,Hyundai,Doosan ,JCB and so on.
9276 2018-07-10 02:55:49 In other news, I can subsist off a diet of entirely vegetable oil. But that would probably be a bad idea.
9277 2018-07-10 02:55:42 if i end up not doing what i want career wise by the time i’m 20 im turning into a hippie, starting my own nonprofit to save the whales & bees & basically everything & living in a volkswagen vanagon that i’ll make fun off of canola oil. how are you doing
9278 2018-07-10 02:55:36 you need gas, your oil is low or may need to be changed, you need to get the engine serviced soon so take it to a dealer/mechanic (top) to get it fixed or checked out, also y'all gotta put on yo seatbelts
9279 2018-07-10 02:55:34 The oil and battery lights will flash on because they’re impacted by the lack of fuel. Same with the yellow check engine light (basically saying to get your car help ASAP)
9280 2018-07-10 02:55:34 I will certainly check that out. But it started after Trump attacked Iran. Then they in retaliation raise their price on oil.Just like when Trump put tariffs on Canadian products they put tariffs on US products. And Chinese did the same thing. Tit for Tat. All Trump
9281 2018-07-10 02:54:54 Can't drill oil because we may endanger animals but kill babies by the 10's of thousands because your not responsible enough to buy contraceptive. Not not talking rape and things like that.
9282 2018-07-10 02:54:30 It's more than that.  This guy is anti-regulation of businesses from banks to oil companies, and that's a prescription for financial and environmental disaster.  #resist
9283 2018-07-10 02:54:25 I cannot find my castor oil 
9284 2018-07-10 02:54:14 When are we going battery or alternative to oil as fuel?
9285 2018-07-10 02:54:07 Oil & water, gasoline & fire, that’s for sure

9287 2018-07-10 02:53:55 There is a motor oil stain in my *Nsync shirt of course... mostly because I need a funnel.. and I hope I can get the stain out because I wanted to wear that shirt to the Pop 2000s show and if I can’t get it out I might as well stay home. 
9288 2018-07-10 02:53:45 Y’all she literally came to my house to give me this oil for my sprained knee. I love her so much
9289 2018-07-10 02:53:40 Does it count if you like to pour in some olive oil first ?!

9292 2018-07-10 02:53:21 but actually though, definitely wasn't joking. never leave a shallow pan of hot oil unattended in the kitchen 
9293 2018-07-10 02:53:13 we would never forget about u 8oz ofcoconut oil 
9294 2018-07-10 02:53:05 Es cierto. Somos  Oil y no nos quieren vender producto.  Sobre todo super.
9295 2018-07-10 02:52:56 #ISIS still able to strike in #DeirEzzor capturing some oil wells in #SDF territory near al-Herigy town. #Syria
9296 2018-07-10 02:52:54 They're okay. Not fluffy like I usually make them. They don't taste like coconut oil though. That surprised me.
9297 2018-07-10 02:52:22 ITS SO EASY you fry lil chunks of plaintain in vegetable oil (til its golden brown) then take it off the oil, smoosh em down, out em back in the oil til their golden brown, drain the oil, add some salt and BAM you got patacones
9298 2018-07-10 02:52:15 It happened to me once, it was an oil based Chile de árbol salsa that shit was so spicy that I had no mf clue how I got home I was just already there I miss that salsa
9299 2018-07-10 02:52:13 Midnight Oil - Diesel and Dust tour.
9300 2018-07-10 02:52:07 I personally like them sliced & charcoal grilled, then drenched with olive oil. Sometimes with other grilled vegetables (eggplant, peppers) on a sandwich. But I don't have the option of charcoal grilling these days, so fritters it is.
9301 2018-07-10 02:52:07 You must show them what happens to a country if people don't vote: Trump, RW Supreme Court, babies in cages and an EPA that cares more about oil than clean water. Their future is at stake.

Morality?
9311 2018-07-10 02:50:17 “OIL”を180°回転させると”710”。この場合のオイルとは大麻から抽出したオイルことで、最近ではオイルの大麻製品は710と呼ばれているとか。

9315 2018-07-10 02:49:43 Just had literally three different commercials in less than 10 seconds but no worries @GetSpectrum it’s surely worth the 180$ a month for ALL OF YOUR INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES. Everyone wants a Disney Incredibles Dodge hemi bottle of olive oil to aid on tying their Velcro shoes.
9316 2018-07-10 02:49:36 extra virgin oil??
9317 2018-07-10 02:49:36 Forget the pipeline Jason. Shell CEO just supported a ban on petrol cars for 2040. Obviously EV cars have a big future. Oil is going to be for petrochemicals. From nail polish to furniture and clothes & everything in between. That's lots homework Jason.
9318 2018-07-10 02:49:29 Grass stains? - use vinegar
Red wine stains? - use white wine
Grease stains? - use soda
Blood stains? - use hydrogen peroxide

9324 2018-07-10 02:48:29 We should remove the US from NATO. And OPEC. We don’t need OPEC telling us how much we are going to pay for oil and gas
9325 2018-07-10 02:48:26 Wouldn't be surprised.

They recycle storylines as often as they recycle ripped t-shirts with baby oil on them.
9326 2018-07-10 02:48:26 @RayCronise i'm just looking at the triangle, do you recommend eating nuts seeds, fruits? fruits have a ton of sugar ( so they say ) how about healthy fats, organic peanut butter, coconut oil, what happens if i drink alcohol does it delay my ability to burn fat for a few days?
9327 2018-07-10 02:48:14 I use it sometimes to make a dressing, but usually use olive or avocado oil and apple cider or red wine vinegar
9328 2018-07-10 02:48:13 Oh okay well try vitamin e oil. It’s not as thick. Jamaican castor oil i usually use on my edges/nape neck
9329 2018-07-10 02:48:13 Will they introduce a resolution promoting squatting over commercial toilets?
About as important.  
You really think this is a major issue after all the millenia humans have been reproducing?

9333 2018-07-10 02:47:42 There's a lot of shitty things big companies do but people buying gas and then holding it solely against the oil companies for producing it (in terms of environmental damage) has long been a bit of a head-scratcher to me.
9334 2018-07-10 02:47:21 I smell heavenly. This new oil and lotion I got is crazy

9357 2018-07-10 02:43:21 Right direction, small steps.  Raw oil and gas production is important but ecologically wrong and unsustainable way to the future global surviving. Have to choose and develop new energy sources and materials recycling principles, especially for arctic region and line.

9398 2018-07-10 02:38:25 We finally received rain in the phoenix area. Felt like an eternity since the last time some drops fell. Now we are left with giant pools of dirty water. All that dirt and oil that was on the roads gets washed away.
9399 2018-07-10 02:38:17 Tengo Oil y nos dejaron en banda. Ypf y Dapsa no nos abastecen de nada.
9400 2018-07-10 02:37:48 What’s with this urban vs rural values? Who said all rural people are conservative? Rural peeps are also fucking their neighbors, having orgies at palm oil plantations, getting their daughters pregnant. The ones making all the wrong noises are mostly the urban conservatives
9401 2018-07-10 02:37:39 "Libertarian/conservative" is a confusing statement all by it's self. It's like oil and water. You are either one or the other. It's akin to being bi-sexual and not deciding. I'm sorry Joe. You know I can relate to the bully part but Trump is far from being dishonest.

9411 2018-07-10 02:34:54 I didn't know if she was trapped in a car that was flipped upside down with a windshield of shattered glass explodeded in her face with oil pouring into the car. Seeing her on the side of the road with no harm was the most relieving feeling ever. I've never been so scared before.
9412 2018-07-10 02:34:31 oh. i thought she doesn't know how to fill the petrol lol. okay la kalau engine oil tak tahu still make sense la haha

9414 2018-07-10 02:34:27 We know you hate the Constitution. 
Appointment of someone who will be true to it and rule according to law even when his own personal views are different must be your worst nightmare. 
Elections have consequences.
9415 2018-07-10 02:34:24 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9416 2018-07-10 02:34:03 you are fool Amish, never discuss your insult.

take action man. can you take any meaningful action? if not then your position is useless.
9417 2018-07-10 02:33:45 At the very least stop subsidizing the oil industry. It is a mature and self-sustaining business.

9440 2018-07-10 02:30:10 I just peeked. The ones in the back are rising ... so at least there's that lol

Police violence is usually justified. 
Just the life that the woman is carrying.

9453 2018-07-10 02:27:35 If it is about life why don’t you prove your opposition to oil wars, climate change, death penalty, meat eating and so on. If you can’t then you are just fishing for ways to control women, as are republicans in general.

9485 2018-07-10 02:23:56 How is that working out so far? Did we avoid oil wars? Maternal death? Climate change? Mass shootings and police violence? Or is your interest in protecting life limited to those methods that control women?

9488 2018-07-10 02:23:20 I think oil money is helping the fundamental islam to remain them a world force. I see that oil price will be down by 2022, so no funding will be avail to islam to sustain, i guess the best strategy is to explain how their ancestors were tortured in the hands of islamic rulers
9489 2018-07-10 02:23:19 Lavender oil!! Seriously knocks me out.
9490 2018-07-10 02:23:09 Now that conservatives will have a majority, I am sure that we will see machine-gun stands on every corner, and women forced into a Handmaiden's Tale existence. Also, oil companies will be drilling in Yosemite and black people will be forced back onto plantations.

9513 2018-07-10 02:18:29 To many Liberals having Malcolm Turnbull in their party is probably not dissimilar to the ALP once having Latham in theirs. Really not wanted and detested, but as castor oil or Epsom salts once was, considered necessary. At least the ALP have purged Latham.  #auspol
9514 2018-07-10 02:18:26 I’d give Media as much faith in their opinion as “Snake oil” will offer everlasting life! Schister’s who push their own polical views. American’s are real the media is fake!

9521 2018-07-10 02:17:09 I just want those two-stroke motors that spew unburnt fuel and oil into the air to be banned already >_<
9522 2018-07-10 02:17:06 olive oil...there are many points she made
9523 2018-07-10 02:17:05 NOTE: Erdogan's son-in-law who has just been appointed Finance Minister was previously best known for selling oil to ISIS!
9524 2018-07-10 02:16:47 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.

Videos of dying birds, Dolphins fr oil spills.
The poisoned orange lakes after acids used in gold mining. Everything Trump does hurts all.
9529 2018-07-10 02:16:06 I'm very disappointed to see palm oil in your ingredients lists. Please do better, @Justins
9530 2018-07-10 02:16:01 I’d rather take a bath in 90 weight oil thats burned up than have my hand anywhere that takes a glove that goes to your elbow 
9531 2018-07-10 02:16:00 Detangling creams for kids helps a lot. I use coconut oil in my child’s hair as well.

9546 2018-07-10 02:13:54 does anyone else get a lot of olive oil ads on instagram or is it just me

Iraqi people only option is burning oil fields that is protect by US & UK companies
9551 2018-07-10 02:13:29 I've seen what palm oil farms do the rain forest. It's ugly and it is devastating.
9552 2018-07-10 02:13:20 I had a blood pressure of 160/120. I was advised these tablets, but learnt that this solution would be life long without curing . I just cut salt and oil in my diet, stopped eating fast food, and walked one hour a day. I am now 120/80. These BP meds only enrich pharma companies
9553 2018-07-10 02:13:11 If anyone ever wondered, the secret to my long hair is: no heat (blow dryer, flat iron) no chemicals (hair dye) and all I use is argon oil after every shower. It seriously restores my hair. It's like $7 for a bottle at the store (walmart, meijer, walgreens)
9554 2018-07-10 02:13:10 So my whole life, I've been making ravioli or tortellini and adding olive oil to the pasta after it was prepared. Apparently I was supposed to be adding the olive oil to the boiling water before the pasta ever went into the pot.

I've been making pasta wrong this whole time.
9555 2018-07-10 02:12:55 I love that @AmyGGiants just had to say, "Yes, Derek Holland did have to rub baby oil all over his body to make that video." ... #SFGiants baseball, you are truly the weirdest and I love you.

i've got another turbo i might be able to get running but it seems like it's gotten soaked with its own pump oil (it's an ancient edwards etp6/200)

so either way i get to have a teardown & part replacement adventure, i think

9580 2018-07-10 02:08:52 Do you have any lavender oil? Try putting some on it- might help with the itching and help it heal faster.
9581 2018-07-10 02:08:39 Oi if I eat leftover salad from Friday night that’s just noodles and cabbage and vinegar and sugar and almonds and oil and carrot ... will I die?
9582 2018-07-10 02:08:31 I recently added argan oil to my moisturizing routine at night and I FEEL SO FANCY.
9583 2018-07-10 02:08:19 I think I could solve all the worlds problems if I could stay in a hot bath, with stress away and lavender oil.
9584 2018-07-10 02:08:18 You skip the part where the engine immediately starts leaking oil as soon as the race is over
9585 2018-07-10 02:08:16 I fucked up bad and didn’t know I got the oil on my purse! so I have at least a week more to go on the latest batch of blisters. I haven’t caught it in like 20 yrs lolll
9586 2018-07-10 02:08:15 First time using coconut oil be like.. lol
9587 2018-07-10 02:08:11 I just had a customer replace his catalytic converter, O2 sensors, and his headers because of a recall where his wife's 2012 Chevy Equinox bypassed oil into the exhaust. He claimed it was common with the new technology [because of emission standards].

早く対応されることを願うのみです..。
9593 2018-07-10 02:07:14 And why, pray tell, would you want to muck around with a workaround? Do you still change the oil in your car? Do you build your own PCs? If you do you are a hobbyist and may not be a serious user. Nothing wrong with that. We all have hobbies.
9594 2018-07-10 02:06:54 Anyone ever wet sanded wood with tung oil. Need some advice finishing a decorative book box. #woodworking
9595 2018-07-10 02:06:46 Should just proceed as normal.  If they want to die as a martyr for their cause...so be it.  I bet the gear they used was produced with oil.
9596 2018-07-10 02:06:24 Wow, I am completely blown away! I bet you would have solved the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in under a week. We all know you have a boat load of projects under your command and it's truly impressive to see you tackel this one with such passion.
9597 2018-07-10 02:06:11 I’m happy to know, there are safeguards to assure the local supply and make money the extra oil with a firm buyer! Hope there’s no tricks on the Chinese letters of the contract! :)
9598 2018-07-10 02:06:09 It’s the best smelling body oil EVER!

9605 2018-07-10 02:05:17 One of the most ridiculous responses I’ve seen. We can extract & transport oil with the highest humanitarian & environmental standards.

9607 2018-07-10 02:05:07 Chicken is seasoned overnight with pink salt, freshly ground pepper, cayenne, a little paprika and Chinese 5-spice, a little cumin, olive oil.

9611 2018-07-10 02:04:02 Still have yet to find a SPF that I legit like. And a good oil free moisturizer. I liked the Neutrogena Hydro Bomb but now it's just meh. I'll just stay collecting my Belif Aqua Bomb samples until I love something that isn't $50. 
9612 2018-07-10 02:03:52 Diffuser and get a lavender essential oil! It works!! I use it for anxiety, it also helps you fall asleep quicker
9613 2018-07-10 02:03:29 I’ve wondered how that much fit but if she didn’t know where to put the wishy washy fluid, I’m going to venture to say she never checked her oil level so I guess it’s possible. Unbelievable but there’s the proof. Someone was that simple.... and has a license to drive.
9614 2018-07-10 02:03:27 I wouldn't think one spoonful would upset the balance too much plus there are some easy simple things to alleviate ants in the home; I spray pennyroyal oil on my window sills and door jam each Spring; they do not not crossing to the inside

9621 2018-07-10 02:02:23 Yes!! I would too. But Gizzy just complains. I thought she & Tobyn were so rude not to go to the essential oil plant with the women. That was rude to do to the hostess.

9629 2018-07-10 02:00:56 PSA to @sanchurro customers: 
If you thought you could enjoy "gluten friendly churros" forget it. They use the same oil as non-gf ones and don't tell you unless you investigate. I wouldn't trust it even if you are "gluten sensitive"

9648 2018-07-10 01:56:29 Leaders are birthed out of nessasty and prepared through process.
Olives only produce olive oil only after they go through a crushing process.
We only find out whats  burried inside of us when life uses things and people to crush us.
9649 2018-07-10 01:56:28 Ya speaking of canvas where to keep them is also a problem. 

Yaaa oil takes hours to dry up. That's why it's very easy to get your canvas real messy if you aren't a careful type.

9653 2018-07-10 01:55:29 Obama care is a bust. Be honest and explain what bronze, silver,etc plans mean. Bronze is junk and pays only 60% of bill. Who could afford to use it. Yet like s snake oil@salesman you peddle it
9654 2018-07-10 01:55:23 The only oil they have is olive.

9659 2018-07-10 01:54:18 Someone once asked what the difference between essential oils and non-essential oils was, because they viewed all oils as essential. So, let me break it down. Any oil you use to fry food in efforts to clog your arteries is  NON ESSENTIAL.
9660 2018-07-10 01:54:15 Rub some oil on em!
9661 2018-07-10 01:54:12 You are a two bit phony who uses religion to line his pockets.  You are a snake oil salesman, nothing more nothing less.  @cherijacobus

9663 2018-07-10 01:53:43 Friendship pillows  there’s even hash oil stains on the dress so it’s extra on brand
9664 2018-07-10 01:53:35 Finally getting in this doomsday preppers and like jesus fuck i am terrified of white ppl. Like that bitch who thinks without oil life as we know it will cease and women will become prositutes within days. Does she know other people?
9665 2018-07-10 01:53:21 also, we make "bean salad" a lot at home, it's just a can of beans (any), diced garlic, lemon juice and some olive oil then whatever herbs you have. You can add whatever fresh veg u have, carrots/radish/tomatoes/capsi/fennel/etc + add a poached egg and it's the perfect meal
9666 2018-07-10 01:53:17 Super thankful for a dad who takes care of me! Got a text at work saying he got my tire patched up and my oil changed! #itsthelittlethings

9668 2018-07-10 01:52:55 Mosquitoes do not like cloves or clove oil.

*this is where I resent @lushcosmetics for changing their wiccy magic massage bar from clove to cinnamon.

9670 2018-07-10 01:52:41 Oh, but you are asking for it. That is what gives us the impression that, if we dig that oil out of the ground, someone will pay for it.

I'm not sure if you want it, but that is a natural assumption when someone asks for something.
9671 2018-07-10 01:52:38 Girl use shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo. It’s sulfate free too and gets wayyyyyy soapier than any I’ve ever used. and deep condition. Their Jamaican black castor oil conditioner is really good too like it feels like mousse. And get oils

9673 2018-07-10 01:52:00 @doriegreenspan can substitute butter or olive oil for canola oil in your roman breakfast cake recipe?
9674 2018-07-10 01:51:56 #CrudeOil prices are still trading with two minds; #US wants #SaudiArabia to reduce prices so that it could be used as an alternative to #Iran oil as #Trump want to put in more sanctions on Iran. India n China buy majority of their oil from Iran.

9675 2018-07-10 01:51:55 What
Didn’t think gave all that Rosneft oil 
To Trump for nothing
9676 2018-07-10 01:51:43 When you talk of oil and the price at the pump you must take into consideration the taxes attached to every drop you pay for.
9677 2018-07-10 01:51:33 Ah I had him on block forever man. Ask him how is his buddie Joe mas doing he vanished on Twitter when all just oil stocks tanked
9678 2018-07-10 01:51:31 I just used coconut oil to remove my makeup and my life is forever changed.

What is your policy here? Do you use palm oil in your chocolate?
9686 2018-07-10 01:49:47 I’ll check my schedule but I’m sure I’m available
9687 2018-07-10 01:49:43 Oil prices started to climb when Republican’ts removed the restrictions on exporting

9690 2018-07-10 01:49:22 We need our communities connected. But, not by train cause the rail lines are overwhelmed with oil and gas transport. Maybe we will have to offer stagecoach services once again in the wild wild West. Might appease the greenies a little.

9696 2018-07-10 01:48:46 I used tea tree oil and it worked way better for me than sea salt! I have this soap and tried using it on my piercing but it didn’t help much. tea tree helps with infections too.
9697 2018-07-10 01:48:33 Palm Oil is a disgusting thing in itself. In Malaysia they are destroying the rain forests to grow it, in India it comes cheap and is used to pollute pure vegetable oils by unscrupulous manufactures with Govt connivance

9701 2018-07-10 01:48:14 The stuffs stuck at the end of the skewers and steeped in cold chili oil. Super hot. I can only eat 2.
9702 2018-07-10 01:48:07 How cheap. $60 for a tiny bottle here. I’ve tried the vape and the oil straight.  Only thing it’s done is help me sleep.  Apparently it helps with inflammation but I haven’t noticed a difference yet.
9703 2018-07-10 01:47:54 We hear you. There's a million snake oil companies, million dollar ventures burning through cash, and then small fries like you and I. On another timeline you actually reviewed our apps, we made cash and increased our sponsorship of you rather than cancel. Misery loves company.
9704 2018-07-10 01:47:43 removing all the billion dollar industry subsidies (like the current 3.3 billion dollar subsidy a year to the oil industry for example) should cover any losses on a crown corporation bus service. We should nationalize the railways while we're at it.

9710 2018-07-10 01:47:03 I guess street? Brisket confit, “Black magic oil,” and avocado salsa on one of the best corn tortillas ever.
9711 2018-07-10 01:46:50 OPEC is to blame. They have manipulated the price of oil for years.
9712 2018-07-10 01:46:44 We just want the food to be good quality- low oil vegetables, good yellow dal & nicely cooked chapatti can be prepared instead of high gravy chola  paneer..in this humid and hot climate...the people especially the elders suffer.
9713 2018-07-10 01:46:44 Have you done your oil change yet?
9714 2018-07-10 01:46:44 I wish I had peppermint oil right now . This headache is on 1000000
9715 2018-07-10 01:46:43 Just stuff they heard somewhere. Friend has a parrot that says " Buy GE, Buy GE."
  Its hilarious
9716 2018-07-10 01:46:38 76, here. And we lived in the back of beyond (at the time - the oil boom changed things).
We didn’t even have a TV for a while - because all we would be able to get was the rural TV station - RATNET, they called it. I remember black and white, though, and our first color one.
9717 2018-07-10 01:46:35 Who buys oil by the liter? Oil prices are normally referenced by the barrel, maybe all other reporting should be as well. This isn’t good, but cleaning up 1500 barrels isn’t that difficult. Please stop using large quantities to sensationalize.
9718 2018-07-10 01:46:34 Analysts are starting to talk 
アナリストたちは話し始めています

about the oil crash being over,
原油の暴落は終わったと

with prices stabilizing in the mid-$30-a-barrel range,

◆over = 終わって
9719 2018-07-10 01:46:32 I’m about to drink the entire bottle of my CBD oil
9720 2018-07-10 01:46:28 @74$/barrel  we should be busy out there . i guess politicians look to fool those not in tune with our oil
9721 2018-07-10 01:46:11 Smoking hash oil with my mom >>
9722 2018-07-10 01:46:04 then we can take over the oil fields, regulate the price of fuels, force the grocery stores to all charge the same, regulate milk and dairy, confiscate big pharma and change our name to Venezuela

9726 2018-07-10 01:45:41 Need less to say that everyone gives their keys to any mechanics for an oil change without thinking that this must be be the most compromising step
9727 2018-07-10 01:45:35 That actually looks really good! @sarahndipity212 gave me a great tip to keep long wigs from tangling easy, it's a spray called Oil Sheen!
9728 2018-07-10 01:45:35 Dear God, our Father, our Abba Father,

9732 2018-07-10 01:45:25 Boy, is this guy a Jerk.  Ron Johnson was reelected in 2016 , just 4 more years to go.  Difficult to see how he stands without a backbone.  We'll Russian sanctions coming off, Exxon and Putin get the $500 Billion Oil deal. Follow the money folks.
9733 2018-07-10 01:45:23 To provide for those who grieve in Zion—to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise in place of a spirit of despair.

9736 2018-07-10 01:44:33 My birthday is tomorrow! It's 7/10, which was always the day that people protested the Confederate Flag at the statehouse until it was removed. It's also "The Other Weed Day" or "Dab Day," as 710 is kitchen (and now just regular) slang for oil. A day of legacy I'm proud to share.
9737 2018-07-10 01:44:29 What's better than fresh sheets in a fresh room with clean floors and everything in it's place and an oil diffuser spewing lavender? NOTHING.

9746 2018-07-10 01:43:54 Storage tanks: they give you a nice buffer on controlling the flow.  Enough of them and you can source your oil from multiple patches until you are ready to optimize a few of them.

9748 2018-07-10 01:43:52 ...the glass is full of air. Emptiness naturally implies the lack of SOMETHING, but not the lack of EVERYTHING. So I’d say this olive oil, while lacking to some, is a bounty to me. [2/2] #emptyorfull
9749 2018-07-10 01:43:51 this oil thing on my face feels great. can you believe before I was using aquaphor and my sis was like “you dumbass you don’t put petroleum on your face cuz it clogs your pores” and I was like oh you don’t say...skjsksjs. I put it on my face cuz I have dry skin ok 
9750 2018-07-10 01:43:49 Certainly! What are the options? Leave the oil 2.000

9755 2018-07-10 01:43:26 CLSA INDIA STRATEGY

9757 2018-07-10 01:42:56 i think it's best to get at a dispensary.  i think that's the only way you can know if it's real.  i don't trust hemp cbd and a lot of what you can buy is just olive oil.
9758 2018-07-10 01:42:56 On the side, red and yellow bell pepper grilled with a little bit of grapeseed oil and finished with a little balsamic and black pepper.

9767 2018-07-10 01:41:23 He rubbed that coat in lavender oil. The Gator was supposed to fall asleep before he mounted it. Oldest trick in the book.
9768 2018-07-10 01:40:50 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
9769 2018-07-10 01:40:46 Haha oh yeah. The media really hyped up their first meeting. I honestly don’t remember Tinsley ever getting the best of Tony. Crazy how the anointing oil gets brought out so quickly.
9770 2018-07-10 01:40:35 NO FREE Lunch! Like the large credits they are giving to Maduro, in return of favorable oil supply contracts from Venezuela, they now want build a foreign network of supplies that could alleviate them of the situations where they can not find a oil seller. Smart move!

9776 2018-07-10 01:39:38 I need fresh flowers to make flower essence water  I think I’ll make some gem elixir/essence oils this weekend too. It’s been a while since I made a new batch. Though I may still have some rose quartz infused oil left
9777 2018-07-10 01:39:32 I'm an oily girl. I mean VERY oily, but hylauronic acid seriously smoothed my skin out. I use the @belifusa aqua bomb and Rose hip oil. It's getting very smooth to the touch. I'm not sure if that's doing the whole trick, but the hydration def helps.

9780 2018-07-10 01:39:14 Walmart has the little tiny Jamaican Castor Oil bottles in the beauty section for $3 and it’s lasting a long time because I don’t use a lot! Let me know if it works for you :’)
9781 2018-07-10 01:39:06 In Marseille they served some tapas-like with my glass of wine and was always amazing stuff. Way better than food from restaurants.  I got mussels, sometimes cheese, bread with herb infused olive oil...  yum !
9782 2018-07-10 01:39:04 OK! So this is an enterprise investment on COPERJ and they need land around COPERJ to expand the refinery business! That sounds like an interesting approach, they need the product from COPERJ, they don't produce all the oil they need, so having they want control refineries!
9783 2018-07-10 01:38:56 Scotland outperforming rUK & our revenue from oil is minimal

Oil currently $77 a barrel - imagine we were Indy & got all that revenue instead of bugger all 

Or we didn't have to contribute to Trident 

Think again about voting YES - GERS just show how badly UK run our economy
9784 2018-07-10 01:38:47 Tottenham Hotspur.  No brainer.   Perfect for a Boston fan who remembers when the Drew Bledsoe draft was a huge deal.  Good team but not one of the money printing oil owner clubs.
9785 2018-07-10 01:38:46 Me either. So i don’t use oil haha
9786 2018-07-10 01:38:38 She needs to give us one example where socialism has succeeded in world history. And don’t give me that Democratic Socialism crap. Democratic Socialism are like oil and water, they don’t mix. Democratism is a lie.
9787 2018-07-10 01:38:10 Yes!!

9792 2018-07-10 01:37:01 Castor Oil, babe! I’m telling you, I’ll wash my face, put it on my brows at night, especially the places I want them to grow. They are looking sooo much better. I didn’t expect it to so I didn’t take  a “before” photo, but they’re really filling out and getting longer at the end!
9793 2018-07-10 01:36:52 Change sauce to Olive Oil and I'd agree
9794 2018-07-10 01:36:18 What's not for sale in American politics? Healthcare bought by Pharma, NRA buys minimal gun laws, defense companies buy higher military spending. Oil companies and others buy polluting rights. Wallstreet herd deregulation. Even breast feeding  is for sale. 
9795 2018-07-10 01:36:15 When you aren’t able to fall asleep until 4am the morning before,  you sprinkle lavender oil EVERYWHERE before attempting to do it all over again. Fingers crossed.

9802 2018-07-10 01:34:42 Don't be naive... @POTUS is choosing business...  he is choosing #Kavanaugh because he has a long track record of being pro big business. Look at the price of oil increase since we backed out of the #Iran deal.. it wasn't about nukes.. it was about business. #consistency

9820 2018-07-10 01:30:28 why don’t you explore your own ideas instead of hijacking mine. so yeah we don’t need tarsands to move on from fossil fuels but we certainly do need to stop mining them if we hope to reduce our impact on our environment and climate. I’m ok with clean oil not dirty tarsands poison
9821 2018-07-10 01:30:25 From my fav @thepioneerwoman: “Put your salmon on a foil lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil salt and pepper. Put the salmon in a cold oven turn onto 400 degrees and set the timer for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes you will have perfect flaky delicious salmon”

9829 2018-07-10 01:29:12 Se viene el fish oil
9830 2018-07-10 01:29:00 Spray bottle of ammonia will work. Carburetor cleaner, too (my dad's favorite solution). Concentrated cedar oil products apparently work. I've not tried the latter yet, though. So, do a bit of research on that one.
9831 2018-07-10 01:28:56 got some CBD oil today and i’m excited to see if i get any results with it
9832 2018-07-10 01:28:36 I'm so healthy that tonight I just had a sweet potato for dinner. Cut into pieces. Heated in oil. Dipped in curry mayo. Fries. I had fries for dinner.
9833 2018-07-10 01:28:24 これは石をぶつけられそうなツイートなんですが、昨日旦那からボーナスの分け前をいただいたので、貯金しに行ってきます。無職なのに通帳の残高増えてってごめんなさい。
9834 2018-07-10 01:28:08 everything lagging except the oil.
9835 2018-07-10 01:27:44 Ha ha! I think it was meant to be a joke, but I have seen coconut oil for sale to be used for cooking.
9836 2018-07-10 01:27:42 use coconut oil, it thickens and darkens them and try brow pomade 
9837 2018-07-10 01:27:12 "Mainly that."

9840 2018-07-10 01:26:38 It's like every time you bring your car in for an oil change, it miraculously comes back with an entirely new list of problems that don't actually exist.
9841 2018-07-10 01:26:31 あー、今朝の朝ドラ！「嫁は流し台の下からもらえ」ってヤツ。流し台に入りきれない体格の人もいるんですよ！って言いたいわね（違う）
9842 2018-07-10 01:26:30 Also, that sucks man you've had it harder than I could've even imagined. You're doing well now though, right? I'm not trying to he a pothead or anything but have you tried CBD oil? It can help ease the pain of most disorders, including arthritis. My brother uses it for his back.
9843 2018-07-10 01:26:15 Haha why did I schedule an oil change for 8 am tomorrow when I get done work at 7am? I’m tired just thinking about it.
9844 2018-07-10 01:26:00 I like the peanuts, but one of my kids has life threatening allergies. Even getting the oil on his skin can trigger a reaction. I've known people who even have allergic reactions to the smell. Smart move by Southwest.
9845 2018-07-10 01:25:24 Hahaha, you should be careful as to not rubbed it all off when you were sleeping tho!! I was using olive oil before I turned to nature republic so I know how it felt

9849 2018-07-10 01:24:50 My brothers just the same Andy.
Owns a big share in an Oil Company but looks like he's just been dragged through a hedge.
Forever giving him clothes & shoes coz he just doesn't have a clue.
Mind you, when we were teens my mind was full of footy & birds, his was full of calculus.
9850 2018-07-10 01:24:39 Or maybe I meant I'm crushing much soda cans cuz the  got me so pumped! Likely  non? Was all that oil really necessary? YES! Thanks @Dutch_Oven45 Damn Dutch  @ those 
9851 2018-07-10 01:24:16 Haven’t tried either, but I’ve tried the oil control toner and cleanser and absolutely love it, so I’ll definitely have to try these in the future!
9852 2018-07-10 01:24:00 I'm with you. Let's replace it all with green solar.

All you have to do to get that started is stop using oil. We'll stop sending it when you stop asking for it!
9853 2018-07-10 01:23:55 Anyone got the hookup on THC oil? My grandpas battling some cancer rn and he’s trying to keep himself together until chemo starts. If so, hit the DMs

9855 2018-07-10 01:23:48 sad shawties smoke their oil pens before bed
9856 2018-07-10 01:23:43 As far as I know. All the oils we consume have a % of Palm Oil in it. The oil manufacturers import it and mix it.
9857 2018-07-10 01:23:38 Something that you could afford to mantain (repair parts/ change of oil etc) as well as the full coverage insurance for it 
9858 2018-07-10 01:23:25 Esos que siempre ganan son virtuales no ponen un peso. El verdadero trader pierde y de cada derrota aprende. En mi experiencia personal la pegue con todo el sector Oil&gas pero he perdido con el bancario. Lo importante es que nuestras estrategias nos permitan cumplir objetivos
9859 2018-07-10 01:23:20 hair oil and body lotion spilled everywhere in my bag. wtf  i do to make god so mad at me .
9860 2018-07-10 01:23:11 Do an oil change at home! It’s pretty simple
9861 2018-07-10 01:22:55 Why did the pirate have nice hair?

Thank you for your time
9862 2018-07-10 01:22:39 Oh I see - you’re responding to bilawal saying support the left. I can’t watch videos 
9863 2018-07-10 01:22:07 not my oil barrel again...
9864 2018-07-10 01:22:05 Like Pruitt,you are an environmental disaster,bribed and financed by big oil and big coal and other resource parasites,chosen by Putin`s puppet in the White House.
9865 2018-07-10 01:22:03 MSM is going to be burning midnight oil once they get their talking points to best learn how to vilify Kavanaugh to paint him as racist, bigoted, misogynistic or all three.

Top chess players or Go game masters have to figure out many steps beyond. Similarly, seeing next few moves that the market shall be unfolding is a must as well for traders to gain an edge in the markets. This vision is needed in planning the trades.
9870 2018-07-10 01:21:44 Thanks. I’m looking up just about anything that could kill it. Using straight pure Tea Tree Oil and soaking my chin in Apple Cider Vinger for a long period of time. It does some good so that’s better than nothing. 
9871 2018-07-10 01:21:37 It’s 2am and I just heard ‘please tell me that’s nutella’ from my kid’s room. In case you wondered if you get more sleep with teenagers than toddlers...nope. And it is Nutella  (seriously, no more palm oil!)
9872 2018-07-10 01:21:34 Feta, baby tomatoes, watermelon, black pepper, basil, Nona Pia's, olive oil salad.

9884 2018-07-10 01:20:43 A 19 el oil?
9885 2018-07-10 01:20:43 It's moving up on my list. Black truffle oil w/salt and pepper? I could eat a pound of it. Imma try garlic and lemon next. Thx boo!

9897 2018-07-10 01:19:05 There are. Sunflower oil can easily replace it while being much more healthier. Just the increased costs outweigh people's health here. Ideally palm oil shouldn't be used at all
9898 2018-07-10 01:19:05 What kinda oil are they using?
9899 2018-07-10 01:18:53 This same kid got the metal toilet paper holder stuck on his finger when he was 6. It took over an hour and lots of oil and patience to get it off.
9900 2018-07-10 01:18:52 It is completely plant based - coconut oil, mung beans, beets.....  I switched to a vegetarian diet about 5 months ago, this burger cooks, looks and tastes like a meat burger; without using any meat.  Try one Pam, you won't regret it!!

Can’t fix it. block.

9938 2018-07-10 01:13:44 1. I can’t braid my own hair for nothing and my friends can’t braid either  2. Girl I think my hair only likes thick oils like castor oil because everything else makes it feel crunchy

9940 2018-07-10 01:13:29 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
9941 2018-07-10 01:13:15 Now I’m confused - who/what are we talking about?
9942 2018-07-10 01:13:14 Monique trying to sell oil. #RHOP

9944 2018-07-10 01:12:42 Clean forces, a sidekick, and Muslim oil, got you your queen back then.
9945 2018-07-10 01:12:27 That what I’m thinking, but we’re not going through much oil and the exhaust isn’t an environmentally unfriendly black colour
9946 2018-07-10 01:12:02 All that GDP and you're still running  $9 billion deficit.. maybe giving the oil away isn't such a great strategy after all.
9947 2018-07-10 01:11:57 It's so hot in my room my coconut oil melted like why.
9948 2018-07-10 01:11:51 Cold onion soup. 
Blend the onions with some olive oil, vinegar, herbs and ice, pour into a bowl. 
Do not salt. Your tears shall provide the seasoning
9949 2018-07-10 01:11:51 aint nothing slick to can of oil
9950 2018-07-10 01:11:49 We could

1. Stop import of palm oil
2. Arrest the owner of Maxis, Ananthakrishnan
3. Stop military exercises and exchanges for starters

9953 2018-07-10 01:11:20 Norway has a trillion in the bank from its oil and gas and the best social welfare system in the world.
It can be done.
9954 2018-07-10 01:11:12 I bought CBD oil for my kids excema. So I was lol f it..... it's worth a try. I rubbed that shit on my back and within 10 mins the spams went away! This stuff is amazing
9955 2018-07-10 01:11:11 I wear a essential oil necklace. With a scent that grounds me. So if I get overwhelmed and can’t get away to be alone and regroup, I smell my necklace to help.
9956 2018-07-10 01:10:41 He runs on the paranoid side of things... I never hear him talk about the need to dramatically re-organize ourselves off a collision course with climate chaos.  I hear a LOT about how women are chaos, but not, you know, oil and gas addiction and single use culture....
9957 2018-07-10 01:10:39 OIL MONEY.
9958 2018-07-10 01:10:37 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
9959 2018-07-10 01:10:33 Use a drop of lemon essential oil! It takes the sticky adhesive stuff right off.
9960 2018-07-10 01:10:26 African black soap, lemon oil, and shea butter will change your ashy life
9961 2018-07-10 01:10:21 One route to work had a fire and the other had an oil spill... so that pretty much set the standards for the week
9962 2018-07-10 01:10:14 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
9963 2018-07-10 01:09:35 I've been adding MCT Oil powder to my organic Rainforest coffee I got at #WorldMarket - delicious
9964 2018-07-10 01:09:26 Garlic salt and a little bit of oil (coconut or olive)
9965 2018-07-10 01:09:14 Can't wait to see you guys at Lucas oil raceway park
9966 2018-07-10 01:09:02 If you ain’t usin coconut oil to shave you ain’t livin
9967 2018-07-10 01:08:52 No one down here has done my weave right like in Greensboro. $400 just for the supposed Best sew in in Charlotte to make the braids and sew in so damn tight I almost looked Chinese and then her reposonse after me triple texting her about it being so tight was “use oil”
9968 2018-07-10 01:08:45 My belief is binge eating sugar/flour/oil is a much more destructive eating disorder than fear of these things.

I think the evidence bears that out.
9969 2018-07-10 01:08:45 Aztec Healing Clay Mask & Almond Oil as a moisturizer afterwards , that’s it 
9970 2018-07-10 01:08:37 バランタインファイネスト店で使ってるやつだわ
9971 2018-07-10 01:08:29 Not oil, minerals and natural gas. Especially rare earth minerals.
9972 2018-07-10 01:07:57 I made deep fried Oreos and I only managed to burn my self with the oil once
9973 2018-07-10 01:07:40 but people who put coconut oil in coffee can be trusted w/ ur life usually
9974 2018-07-10 01:07:27 I feel like electrically/solar powered cars haven't fully blew up into mass production simply because that'll mean big time CEO's losing oil/gas money.
9975 2018-07-10 01:07:06 @sues3jewels @hichamharb @MireilleHamdan 
I'm eating cucumbers, labne and olive oil! So yummy!

9978 2018-07-10 01:06:45 #Oil: We keep our neutral stance as we expect crude oil to trade close to its fair  value range of 45-55 USD.

9982 2018-07-10 01:06:43 You can't hold them anyway cause the oil on your skin would kill them so
9983 2018-07-10 01:06:41 On coats. Caliban Green, Nuln Oil, Caliban Green, Warpstone Glow, moot green. 

On armor plates. Add black, then black mixed with Caliban to the beginning.
9984 2018-07-10 01:06:14 Coincido. Veo un 2 semestre con más tranquilidad en emergentes y vuelta a maximos en spx. Volverá el carry  y el dxy enfrenta resistencias de corto a la baja. El oil puede dar algún recorte también pero siempre en su canal alcista. Los earnings de la 2Q serán buenos también
9985 2018-07-10 01:06:13 LOL.  Yep, break out the Snake Oil.
9986 2018-07-10 01:06:06 Dude you brought the history geek out in me Rockefeller was one of the biggest monopolies(like the game how you take over and control stuff) of his time he and his standard oil company were huge along with Andrew Carnegie and Cornelius Vanderbilt

9988 2018-07-10 01:05:54 I’m my own guinea pig n have been consuming only very low above ground carbs in veggies but lots of good natural high fat eg: Cold Press Coconut Oil, butter, avocado, olive oil, real grass fed beef, lamb, free range eggs, poultry and never felt better.
9989 2018-07-10 01:05:43 Carlson labs lemon fish oil taste just fine.
9990 2018-07-10 01:05:37 Oh no clothes and oil
9991 2018-07-10 01:05:36 It’s 2017. It’s an intermittent noise and the guy had changed the oil and aligned it. But it’s still there, all this combustion has me a tad freaked out
9992 2018-07-10 01:05:33 CBD oil, massaged directly into my back, does wonders for these back spams 
9993 2018-07-10 01:05:33 How can canadas oil and the dollar help each other when we cant get our oil to world markets.  Its goes to texas by train for free.
9994 2018-07-10 01:05:20 it's a spray on/powder that just absorbs the oil and adds a little texture how
have u never
im dying
9995 2018-07-10 01:05:17 Support Canadian Oil Independence...Ethical oil...from Canada.
9996 2018-07-10 01:04:55 Glad I got the oil changed on the truck!  First driving scene I see, I'm putting in for it!  The money I get will go towards a new cap on my truck!
9997 2018-07-10 01:04:54 A mixture of fresh aloe and tea tree oil will help get rid of blemishes on your face! Don't rub it in let it, let it air dry!!..You're welcome
9998 2018-07-10 01:04:51 I actually wish the Lucas Oil boys were a part of it

10000 2018-07-10 01:04:30 I'm used to seeing the "fair trade" label attached to coffee, but who had the idea to attach it to oil? What makes it "fair trade?" Is it pumped by communal oil barons in the mountains of Colombia? Is this the same as the "ethical oil" label of a few years ago?
10001 2018-07-10 01:04:26 Damn. You know it's hot when you come home and your coconut oil looks like formaldehyde!
10002 2018-07-10 01:04:18 Keeping staples like tuna and chickpeas and olive oil in my pantry has been a godsend!
10003 2018-07-10 01:03:59 Uy magpapalit nako ng oil sa mc ko.. yahoooooo! #MaineForShellAdvance
10004 2018-07-10 01:03:57 เค้าไม่อยากพูดกับคนบัตรขายไม่หมด 
10005 2018-07-10 01:03:54 Snake oil man POOF
10006 2018-07-10 01:02:58 We had the same issue mechanic said it was injector cups were letting the oil in the fuel return. Haven’t got it fixed yet so not sure

10010 2018-07-10 01:02:34 Just noticed how much oil Spice put on her legs #LHHReunion
10011 2018-07-10 01:02:27 Is this recent one or 10 years ago .. because in 2008 or something she did baby soap or oil add right
10012 2018-07-10 01:02:21 อิดอกถ้าขลังจริงช่วยทำให้นี่ติ่งที เคยติ่งแทตอนช่วงเพลงวาย ละคิดว่าหลังจากนั้นก็คงติ่ง ไปๆมาๆเพลงเริ่มดูงงๆนี่เลยบายเลยจ้าา ขลังจริงตกกูให้ด้ายยย

comecei logo comprando a máscara oil argan pq a mari morena disse que ela é a melhor da marca
10016 2018-07-10 01:01:53 Well done Zoos Victoria! A giant company like Nestle should not use Palm Oil. The farming of Palm Oil destroys important animal habitat and is the main threat to the orangutans.
10017 2018-07-10 01:01:18 Don't forget liberals also run our universities, tech, media, law, finacne, art, culture, innovation and internet. This is why we have 300 tv stations and the gop need an Australian to create theirs. Good thing you guys can dig holes for oil or you'd be useless
