3 2018-03-17 23:04:22 Technically we're not getting anything for "free", what being valued commodities to advertisers and all. I know that business model sucks and all, but years of conditioning us with access to "free" content is powerful.

Some 1st gen Aussies would have a regional/ag background & may be more at home on the farm & bring new ideas & commodities to the mix.

17 2018-03-17 20:50:10 I think this goes to the heart of what I was saying; when you consider employees as commodities, you explicitly categorize them as not "part of the team," but as something to be used for your purpose. That's exactly what I'm saying isn't required, or even wise.

38 2018-03-17 20:40:50 Why is that any surprise  ... the Mayor of Oakland is “Cracker Jacks”.  Common sense & rationality are rare commodities within Oakland City limits.
39 2018-03-17 20:23:26 America for sale, UN Sustainable development, right there on the UN website, get to about page 30 and it starts going into "marshalling resources and minerals, oil, etc".  Just like HReed, Hill, and others were doing, selling off commodities to globalists.
40 2018-03-17 20:10:22 The "marketplace of ideas" is a misleading analogy; ideas are not commodities. Ideas are more like parasites or viruses, seeding themselves in viable hosts.
41 2018-03-17 20:01:34 Kenya sio ya wakenya. This govt has consistently shown that it doesn't listen to the needs of its citizens. It's like we are just commodities for the govt to exploit as it wills. This is one government that doesn't want to empower it's citizens in any way.
42 2018-03-17 19:54:12 Oh right, and it's funny when "investment professionals" think they can value crypto. It really is funny. Trade commodities before saying stupid things.
43 2018-03-17 19:53:47 Crypto twitter is a very small part of crypto. All commodities have day and swing trading. It’s part of crypto growing up into a real commodity.  As mainstream adoption grows, the moonshots will get smaller and smaller too, as we approach the actual value of these coins
44 2018-03-17 19:48:30 And the government wants you to believe this is what you'd get in a commodities food box. Instead you'd get dry milk powder, a few cans of corn, green beans, peas, a jar of peanut butter, maybe dried egg powder, possibly a can of pink salmon or of pork or beef. Nothing fresh.
45 2018-03-17 19:47:40 Movement of commodities by rail should be deemed an essential service since most shippers have no other option.

Order the pricks back to work!!!
46 2018-03-17 19:40:05 The commodities a rain check giving and to rags turning
To let you down I don't ever want
To leave this town I don't ever want

To begin it's time, not is it?
A little bit bigger I'll get, but I'll admit then

47 2018-03-17 19:34:30 I guess with the persistence of cash shortages and basic commodities price increases ED now means Economic Delusional
48 2018-03-17 19:20:15 re: train are they even thinking about commodities that has raised prices now lol
49 2018-03-17 19:19:31 I read this same person, stopped making mainstream films, and turned to making gay porn. No joke. We all have different dreams. My dream was to be like Billy Ray Valentine and become a commodities trader, as in Trading Place (1983)Lol
50 2018-03-17 19:03:16 Growth is also meaningless when things that used to be free become commodities for purchase.
51 2018-03-17 18:48:58 OMG this was exactly my first thought too.  Just need Cole Konrad to retire from commodities trading to fight the winner.
52 2018-03-17 18:23:07 @realdonaldtrump hoping u were a quick study in office instead of the last no it all before u. Cabinet picks at nascent begining compared to know commodities later on show this in action. Kelly is a gem, Rex was compromised by deep state, Sara is just spectacular
53 2018-03-17 18:19:08 Who to follow for stocks, commodities, indexes, etc.?
54 2018-03-17 18:01:28 Define taxable? What are they taxing? Securities?commodities? Currency? Income? All these things are to be determined pending regulation. Until we know how they will classify crypto its up in the wind
55 2018-03-17 17:54:56 And how does that affect the price of commodities in Olosha Market?
56 2018-03-17 17:42:12 Less commodifying development, more creating commodities *for* development.

By analogy to construction, we’re standardizing on shapes/sizes of nails, screws, wood (e.g., 2x4). Freeing us from reinventing the basics for every project.
57 2018-03-17 17:18:45 You have the right to access, you dont have the right to all services, commodities, and treatments without compensation of the provider. I will say we can make our healthcare system better, but i wouldn't say the concept used is wrong.
58 2018-03-17 17:12:37 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
59 2018-03-17 17:09:55 Thanks for sharing this brave and impactful conversation. If you can open the mind of a commodities trader there is hope in this world.
60 2018-03-17 16:53:50 Why is honesty and responsibility rare commodities anymore? I thought they were a basic tenant of being an adult and a good person. If we are to be judged by the content of our character, why are so many people in power lacking it?
61 2018-03-17 16:53:19 Pq nadie quiere invertir realmente, hoy la productividad no está dada por más o menos horas de trabajo... esta dada en tener herramientas (inversión) + capacidades (educación) = competitividad!!! Cuando el Estado y los privados podremos agregar valor a los commodities!
62 2018-03-17 16:17:48 We are hot commodities honey. Sorry your sign is irrelevant and trash and a weak lover!!
63 2018-03-17 16:13:28 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
64 2018-03-17 16:11:22 I lost it in a late night scuffle with a commodities trader that I mistook for Eddie Olczyk at River Shannon after the game 7 first round loss in 2011. #stopitrightthere
65 2018-03-17 16:08:34 @JupiterAM_UK does jupiter invest in commodities ?
66 2018-03-17 16:04:12 Brilliant pattern recognition. My take is Resources-as-Commodities paradigm gave way in 2001 (ICE complex oil-driven) to Resources-as-Assets (passive quasi-equity) paradigm. This is now giving way to Resources-as-Money paradigm (via opaque sovereign Enron prepay) #OOTT @chigrl
67 2018-03-17 16:02:15 We are slaves of commodities, in this times, with our knowledge in science and psychology we created this dependent ideology that people in power use to manipulated us.
68 2018-03-17 15:53:52 It’s better to either come up with your spouse or have your own money. Some Ppl with money have the tendency to treat lesser earning spouses like commodities
69 2018-03-17 15:34:29 And that’s my overall point.  First and second round picks are extremely valuable commodities.  You have to hit on these picks in order to field a winning team.  I’m not gonna fault Reese for drafting quality players.  The fault lies in drafting poor players.
70 2018-03-17 15:21:57 Competition is questionable for commodities let alone education.
71 2018-03-17 15:04:00 For those who have forgot the retail inflation of essential commodities was at 18-20% during the world class economist's rule! #Nostalgia for those asking where are achche din!
72 2018-03-17 15:03:27 Okay, so if cheap sugar will make Americans obese, how does that really benefit Americans. If we use cheaper Chinese steel to build a bridge that will crumble and kill citizens, how does that benefit Americans? Americans have been used to buying commodities at a cheaper price,...
73 2018-03-17 15:01:41 Rare commodities are worth more than good
74 2018-03-17 15:00:14 Agreed---when will people wake up and realize that they are nothing more than commodities to be bought and sold by big business and the political establishment?...And that they are being played by the very data that is being collected about them?
75 2018-03-17 14:28:58 Spend data should be analysed on an item level front, which provides a thorough level of differentiation amongst different suppliers and commodities. This in turn will lead to more timely and favourable strategies, helping companies get better insights into their total spending.
76 2018-03-17 14:16:21 Rather than resisting host authorities, perhaps they may be supplying those 'host authorities' with commodities......

78 2018-03-17 14:00:23 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
79 2018-03-17 13:50:01 The marketization of HE has jettisoned the pure interest in learning as degrees are now described and advertised as commodities for profitable jobs. So, yes, this transactional process would be open for dispute.
80 2018-03-17 13:48:16 But massy store prices have gone up.......... which commodities are he referring to?
81 2018-03-17 13:45:26 Why rates of commodities are very high in market.BPL&mdle class can't eat nuetrious food
82 2018-03-17 13:33:19 Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Allen Chastanet says the cost of local commodities has not gone up. Quoting data from the latest social and economic review, the PM affirms his government’s economic policies, which included a 2.5% VAT reduction, have saved small businesses.
83 2018-03-17 13:16:37 Do anarchists honestly believe that nations can function without production of commodities? Like, how is your ‘evidence’ of the USSR's ‘state capitalism’ going to be the fact that they produced things that satisfied human needs?

86 2018-03-17 13:08:31 They’ve made them all safer when people were getting hurt and dying. Fact of the matter is that horses are just commodities, bank notes, a way for them to fund their lifestyle. If they die, they die. Move onto the next poor bugger. Repeat until fade
87 2018-03-17 13:01:27 As African governments work to get a fair trade with their commodities, they need to work hard on the security of their countries otherwise the "war on terror" will move to Africa to stop the progress. Know your ennemy and how he moves and victory is yours!!!
88 2018-03-17 13:01:14 I think at this moment, majority of Nigerians prefer to have money stolen than having them been butchered, and living a miserable and frustrating life due to the state of the economy and the high cost of commodities...
89 2018-03-17 13:00:41 i Would say that more competition from US carriers is needed to ensure the timely movement of rail commodities. CN &CP has had a monopoly in Canada forever.
90 2018-03-17 13:00:24 Community health centers philosophically the same as food shelves. When life essentials are for-profit commodities, both are necessary
91 2018-03-17 12:28:14 Because oil, gas and metals are such insignificant commodities 
92 2018-03-17 12:24:10 So perhaps a good place to start is in your industry ~ seeing if ethically aware funds for investment can be created to support new structures for job creation ~ how many portfolios of fund managers are trading in commodities for eg at expense of citizen wellbeing ?

95 2018-03-17 11:56:23 South Africa needs to imitate the developed countries such as Germany to clean environment and to grow our economy by encouraging recycling of waste products to valuable commodities.

97 2018-03-17 11:36:51 #DialogueMPs Policy instability is a major challenge in Zambia especially in the agricultural marketing of commodities.
98 2018-03-17 11:32:57 Same thing will happen with healthcare. Healthcare even basic healthcare is not a right. Education is not a right. They are commodities and must be treated as such. If people want to see what Single payer healthcare is, go to your local VA hospital. That's what it is.

103 2018-03-17 10:37:48 However horse racing is a nasty business for greedy people where horses are commodities  where if you bet and the horse doesn't finish or dies you get your money back....
104 2018-03-17 10:36:29 Only problem you will have is when the rest of the world isn't willing to accept dollars for commodities. But you have largest and most expensive army to stop that
105 2018-03-17 10:35:43 The *real* reason why Commodities is the first part of the book
106 2018-03-17 10:24:00 Stocks at all time highs in terms of price to earnings due to low earnings impact of the deep recession of 2018. Even after stripping it out it remains to be in 20’s for S&P500. Commodities & REITs seem to the only bet left for this year to invest
107 2018-03-17 10:15:57 They have the best players because they massively overspend for well known commodities. Most 14 year old boys who play FIFA could tell them about Mendy, Walker, Sane, De Bruyne, Laporte etc.

109 2018-03-17 09:36:33 I totally agree with you. What is the volume of trade amongst ourselves especially in commodities/agric, solid minerals and human capital? This are areas where we can make quick and steady wins assuming we maximize and improve the free movement of man&goods through our borders
110 2018-03-17 09:33:32 3) Doctors r not robots - but increasingly treated simply as commodities to be shoved around/used as suits - but at what cost? Govt, prof  bodies & BMA have let docs down.
111 2018-03-17 09:03:06 Eff off Bill. He creepliy egged Trump on and put the unwitting female in harm's way and degraded her w. the hug him crap. Commodities-people as commodities. Billy & Trump share that mindset.
112 2018-03-17 08:40:26 Never stop talking about that. I am so disappointed with many fellow Brits behaving like this. I despair at what is happening to this country. Compassion and empathy are precious commodities these days, it seems.
113 2018-03-17 08:37:42 Would focus on commodities as there are many risks geo politically economically and financially. Debt very high globally and rising intetest rates and inflation may threaten the very paradigm we have enjoyed for a long time. Moves by China and Russia creating alternative system.
114 2018-03-17 08:30:27 Commodities are where value investors go to die
115 2018-03-17 08:21:52 FISH ARE WILDLIFE NOT COMMODITIES. All species are valuable for functional marine ecosystems
116 2018-03-17 08:13:32 He is a very intelligent person but please don't take his hypothesis as Bible. Economics is complex & ever evolving subject. His recent hypothesis of commodities going into 20 years of bear market has gone totally awry.

Money paid to you will be extracted from tax payers by increasing electricity bills and over taxation in fuel commodities
121 2018-03-17 06:52:49 How so? You are saying hard commodities cannot be monetised? Or that WW3 is financial?
122 2018-03-17 06:51:37 One of the aim should also be bringing down the price of food commodities

125 2018-03-17 05:38:50 The #LaSalleStTax is one of the worst ideas ever. The commodities exchange made Chicago great and this tax would put people out of work, and drive the Exchanges out of Chicago. If any idea is proposed in Cook County you can be sure I would never support it! #TaxationIsTheft #ATR
126 2018-03-17 05:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
127 2018-03-17 05:30:22 Well, get everyone to pay direct tax, and indirect tax on all commodities even if it is a single digit. Tax exclusions brought indifference
128 2018-03-17 05:25:56 My personal favorite is that the definition of commodities is basically everything...except onions. The story is comical, and reactionary governance at its finest.
129 2018-03-17 05:15:01 the galling part is that proceeds go to the government while the citizens suffer from both a lack of power and not having those profits get reinvested into things that will actually help them. That being said, best remedy would be to relax sanctions on energy commodities to DPRK

137 2018-03-17 03:40:14 So is our opposition,  so is our payed media. Recently there has been an escalation of 10-15% in the prices of basic commodities but who cares.

Please take out some time and refer Manifesto of Congress for year 2004 & 2009 Specially. 

Some of the Highlights.
Price of Essential Commodities will be down in 100 Days. just Refer RBI data of Inflation of that period . Were prices Reduced?
140 2018-03-17 03:08:21 Why not? China wants something and so does Saudi. Saudi gets there valuation and China gets to purchase commodities using Yuan.
141 2018-03-17 02:56:24 We're capitalists and we're going to bleed this country dry, and that's just the way it is! So get over it and be good little passive labor commodities!

143 2018-03-17 02:27:06 I would like to continue to support small business but if they can’t provide basic commodities for their clients it tells me all they care about is to make a profit.
144 2018-03-17 02:23:21 I admit I was wrong about it being 'backed' but surely the use of the dollar for the trade of most commodities would give the us a financial advantage?
145 2018-03-17 02:19:30 But would you agree that the fact that most commodities are traded in dollars gives the us an economic advantage

147 2018-03-17 01:18:09 The point in having a carbon tax is to increase the price of the fossil fuel commodities. When the price of any commodity increases, alternatives are sought, and demand decreases. The tax forces those most responsible for polluting the atmosphere to pay the highest tax rate.
148 2018-03-17 01:13:00 At times, Manipur was accessible only by Air because highway via Kohima would be blocked, road via Jiribam in bad shape. Even essential commodities would be scarce. LPG cylinders would sell for ₹2000/-.
149 2018-03-17 01:08:54 It's frightening that citizens are treated as commodities, essentially spied upon & their "5000 data points" exploited. Is the next step to develop more protocols on how to exclude those unlikely to vote for a certain party? We already have gerrymandering & voter suppression.
150 2018-03-17 01:03:36 Key commodities as a society advances, replacing the one before once it reaches abundance:
1. animals
2. metal
3. combustibles (oil, coal)
4. rare earth materials

What do the last 3 have in common?

They are mostly extracted from the ground.

198 2018-03-18 20:31:28 Biggest mistake made with welfare was to end the commodities program of a box of food.  Govt quickly learned not many people would sign up for the box of food and the hippies could not trade it for drugs.  There was no street value.  Govt changed to food stamps a form of money.

I also include Corbyn in this since his language in Scotland on 9/3/18 painted our friends, loved ones, co-workers & fellow EU citizens as mere commodities.

255 2018-03-18 13:56:37 True;
But when undertaking any project as a firm you need to take calculated risks. The probability is half even if movable assets are used to cove the loss. 

My line of thinking is more on how trading commodities work. You finance the project & take full responsibilities of it.
256 2018-03-18 13:42:54 Some countries do not tax private ownership of commodities & class crypto as such. Neither do they require you to declare them on your tax return. Selling profit is tax free. Holding is tax free. Legally.

The USA & their system is only applicable to US citizens.
257 2018-03-18 13:20:12 Holy shit. Astounding info. I feel so f-in played. We're all just tiny informational cogs, supply/demand intellectual commodities. Group think. Mind control. Everyone of us is a manipulated puppet in psyops social media controlled world. At the mercy of Google ads/algorithms etc.
258 2018-03-18 13:19:49 That’s the easy part. Then they will have to integrate that despite this, we are human and we are all created equal.

405 2018-03-16 20:25:32 I just think the Market needs to be put back in its place - move away from Polanyi's Market Society.

415 2018-03-16 18:37:29 my view on US canada -- 

US runs a small surplus in manufactures/ small deficit in commodities (oil), but basically it is close to being in balance. 

Services trade globally hugely distorted by trade in intangibles with tax centers so not sure you can really sort out much there
416 2018-03-16 18:37:11 12-14 rise was not coupled by global growth. 2004-2008 was.
12-14 was a rebound high.
and yes as global commodities crashed producer economies crashed pulling down with it global growth. we are peculiar thats why we slowed post crude crash stimulus end in early 2016 (before DeMo)

439 2018-03-16 16:01:35 This has little to do with price. It has to do with supply relative to demand. No matter how high demand is for btc no more are produced. This is in contrast with other commodities such as metals

Toys are commodities, and stores that created a sense of wonder didn’t translate to sustaining sales in the online delivery era. Turning them into conventional big box stores only accelerated their decline. My last couple Toys R’ Us visits were sad.

467 2018-03-16 13:43:56 Yes “complete” is the operative word here, and one which I intentionally left out.

469 2018-03-16 13:40:27 Tying Bitcoin to a basket of commodities would actually remove a huge amount of its value. Centrally backing a decentralised network would introduce centralised risk and take away the trustless nature of the network which is where its true value lies.

495 2018-03-16 11:53:21 Who are as gullible as anybody else simply because of their behaviour. Incidentally,I handled one such person for a short time and tried to dissuade from investing into commodities but the investor said that he is making 25% fixed return monthly & even mocked at my suggestions

497 2018-03-16 11:19:53 I agree with the sentiment. However isn’t there a risk that unscrupulous gangs will use children as trafficking commodities if their families know they can use their kids to get into the UK?
498 2018-03-16 11:04:52 Yup...China has also been land grabbing mineral deposits (land) in Africa for some time...they got more gold then they can pay for oil and other commodities with it therebye devaluing the dollar even more..

501 2018-03-16 10:51:48 Woman are not commodities to banter about thakhani. We are actual human beings with dreams aspirations, goals, emotions, intelligence and have a wealth of knowledge and value to contribute to society. This isn't the 1950s! 

Get your head out of your ass
502 2018-03-16 10:51:46 :) FMCG products are commodities created into brands with no service factor. Earlier No choice so default. Today it is just the customer journey and experience that rules. Everything else is a commodity.
503 2018-03-16 10:50:08 The global #drybulk shipping industry is an essential part of the International #shipping sector, with ocean going vessels representing the most efficient, and often the only method of transporting large volumes of basic commodities and finished products.
504 2018-03-16 10:49:04 It’s really a head scratcher to be buying US equities at these valuation levels especially when they are up 380% since 09. Your incremental $ should be going elsewhere (EM, Japan, Europe), commodities (energy, metals, aggs), or liquid alternatives. Remember, buy low & sell high!
505 2018-03-16 10:42:57 Everyone is jumping on the #commodity bandwagon – or so it “appears”. The number of emails pumping up commodities has skyrocketed. However, when I look at ETF flows its more of the same - investors piling into equity ETFs and commodity ETFs inflows are nowhere to be found.
506 2018-03-16 10:40:12 #Commodities are providing positive #carry at the moment. Astoria’s Multi Asset Risk Strategy has heavy exposure to #commodities and #inflation. The positive carry works well for us in conjunction with other risk premias we are harnessing (#beta, #value, #momentum, #quality).
507 2018-03-16 10:36:13 But please stop creating an imaginary barrier from people who are unable to play. It can be anxiety, lack of access to good internet, physical disability, maybe the local gaming community is toxic? DMs are commodities & games are hard to find.

516 2018-03-16 09:14:14 @RockcityFM NLC advocating for #56,000 minimum wage to me is a misplacement of priority, this will only result to inflation of prices of goods, commodities & services.

533 2018-03-16 07:39:17 They do but challenge anyone on ‘useless productivity graphs’. Only tell us so much but clear we need to up our game. Productivity leads to competitiveness. Fail to compete & we’re out the game esp in commodities like cereals (where so many biz depend on BPS)

539 2018-03-16 06:45:54 What to do the committees can't understand where poor governance alienates people's labour from them. Its a problem of a society that values commodities and brands more than the hands that go into production.
540 2018-03-16 05:59:27 Buhari himself told us that within 4 years, Nigerians will feel his impact! Since he came on board, the prices of many commodities have skyrocketed and have stubbornly, like him, refused to come down!
541 2018-03-16 05:54:56 Hey Trevor. What good has @edmnangagwa done to date?. No media/ electoral reforms.  No cash in the banks,  high basic commodities price.
542 2018-03-16 05:43:14 Free stuff for everyone. We had to make on "relief" at about 1/3 of welfare $ for 6 mo before being considered. Then take 3 buses across town to pick our alloted commodities once a month. We lived, but it wasn't easy, as it should be for anyone living on the public $$. Mr obama..
543 2018-03-16 05:38:03 Guys, if we can't see the lucrative crypto derivatives paired to hedge bets in physical commodities or currencies, like, come on..this is a revolution
544 2018-03-16 05:35:03 If ur bored: Read about Soros/Druckenmiller/Tudor/bacon/jim rogers/.   Anyone in commodities.  They all started in futures or commodities. The leverage was huge and also the volatility.  Rogers/Soros/druckenmiller all worked together. Soros would size up the other 2’s ideas.
545 2018-03-16 05:32:30 Keep up and save the girl child. Why trade humans like commodities!

549 2018-03-16 04:32:48 Fact:No country is self reliant and trade deficits have to be for some commodities. It's all about the cost of producing. An I phone made in US would be more costly than the one made in China give the other brands a field day.

552 2018-03-16 03:52:49 As finanças do governo Dilma quebrou, porque toda grana que entrava era pra pagar JURO DA DÍVIDA, e porque o país é completamente desindustrializado, calcado na venda de commodities e no consumo estimulado pela baixa ''virtual'' do câmbio.
553 2018-03-16 03:49:22 Since in trading currencies you’re buying one currency and selling another, you’re simultaneously going long and short. Therefore, unlike trading stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and most other asset classes, currencies, as tradeable instruments, have no structural bias.
554 2018-03-16 03:39:04 I imagine Getting back into trading futures commodities after getting my ass kicked the last time has gotta be like hitting the crack pipe after getting out of rehab.

556 2018-03-16 03:29:11 Your opinion is not based on proper research to understand why commodities go up & down in price.
You are making assumptions, not stating truth, which creates stress, anxiety & drama ALL unnecessary & not the fault of tariff negotiations!

Democrats, Chicken little syndrome.

558 2018-03-16 03:17:59 Are you a citizen? Have you lived here long? You seem naive to Capitalism. Commodities (steel& aluminum etc) go up & down for many reasons. I posted a chart that shows the past decade rise n fall of "steel". You see 2011was the highest & Americans were paying higher taxes too!
559 2018-03-16 03:16:02 Most Indices & Commodities worldwide are within the shadow of the Outside Bar Candles formed in earlier weeks. Unless they move out of their Wkly Ranges on closing basis decisively in current week directional momentum would have to be awaited.

But regarding commodities and manufacturing sectors, you know absolutely nothing!
570 2018-03-16 02:09:52 That’s called a “straw man argument”, you evil monster. No no one thinks pregnant women are commodities, we think the innocent life inside them is worth protecting. You seem to think their lives are only valuable if traded for cash
571 2018-03-16 02:07:19 I actually enjoyed it. I to am a early investor in cryptos so I’m only down on profits but a lot of profits nonetheless. I’m use to volatile swings in the market I come from the commodities and fx markets.
572 2018-03-16 02:04:52 commodities or exhibitions. Nobody should be rated or voted on that sort of behaviour creates the very environments that already harm communities. None of us have to reach the eurocentric, ableist or xenophobic fallacious stereotypes to be considered existent.
573 2018-03-16 01:56:23 The price for goods that are manufactured off shore would go up...those that are made here would not be affected (you would not tariff selected commodities and raw materials).  Businesses could avoid the tariff by manufacturing goods here.
574 2018-03-16 01:44:39 It's BACK LOTUS to Campaign, Not black Lotus. Is any miracles happens? MODIJI to down the Prices of Essential commodities. Gas to 400/₹ , free travel to Senior most Citizens, Reduction in Medicines price. It's four fold rice is alarming. A Doctor fee 500₹
575 2018-03-16 01:27:24 It's a currency with fluctuations and uncontrollable prices of commodities that are less than 10% of their production ( available to sell to the world) also with an unreliable goverment as regulator i don't believe this have a significant help.
576 2018-03-16 01:19:40 Your child, your right to parent. The Deep State wants to control our children. They are commodities to them, to be used for whatever purpose they see fit. Kids lured by bring on TV, fame, etc
577 2018-03-16 01:10:51 Lots of nuances. Private Chinese investors are risk averse, so they aim for risk or high return sectors. So developed markets, real estate, technology and commodities. No private investor will enter emerging markets infra for eg without a state guarantee.

579 2018-03-16 01:01:48 There is actually relatively clear dividing lines with regards to investment. In DMs, China investing in what it wants. In simple terms, advanced firms/technology. In EMs, China investing in what it needs: inputs/commodities. Making money is not a top priority in either case

581 2018-03-16 00:57:34 from CBB's Q4 #Commodities Tracker:

"Net production capacity rose in #steel for a 7th consecutive quarter, w/large proportions of firms reporting they added or reactivated capacity instead of retiring or taking capacity entirely offline."
582 2018-03-16 00:44:42 Yes and the American stock market is prone to boom and busts; again the Stock Market is not the economy plus the TSE is a commodities/ resources laden index that is under performing for the last decade not just 2yrs. Name any and I will name any moving in or expanding.
583 2018-03-16 00:42:28 Before you make a fool of yourself. The disputed surplus/deficit, each country reporting their figures in local currency. Canada sells us lots of commodities (energy, minerals, metals, lumber, milk, etc) commodities are often settled in USD rather than local currency.
584 2018-03-16 00:31:28 Esse país só vai ser um país competitivo no dia que a gente não tratar educação como gasto. Aí vamos passar a exportar inteligência e não só commodities.
585 2018-03-16 00:25:23 Because Canadian TSE is commodities heavy, and commodities are under performing. It's a world market and stocks are not fine grained indicators of economic health like wage growth and employment rate. Name the businesses leaving in droves; I can name the ones moving in.
586 2018-03-16 00:25:04 If we are going to finally see a bigger #squeeze in the #usd, which currencies are the playbook? The commodities or the other majors? #aud #cad #nzd #Think
587 2018-03-16 00:24:45 Sure - but let's imagine a world when people are buying bitcoin instead of buying equities/commodities or anything that can produce "real world" return by form of services and products.  Investing in bitcoin is great option for one person - but how it can work on macro scale?
588 2018-03-16 00:16:25 Of course-why in a global marketplace, where commodities are bought and sold internationally. would you dare to assume that a commodity mined in Russia could show up anywhere else on the planet? You are committing the error of replying logically to a mind closed by preconception.
