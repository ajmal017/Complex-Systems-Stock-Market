6 2018-07-23 23:59:21 Well, at least when Trump isn’t tweeting bullshit, lies, and braggadocious hyperbole, he’s doing something worthwhile: going after his critics in the intelligence community, allowing oil drilling in ANWR, and declaring open season on endangered species.

50 2018-07-23 23:56:08 If you have $1 trillion in oil wealth to distribute among a population of 5 million, you can do all sorts of things that aren’t replicable anywhere else.
51 2018-07-23 23:56:05 I don’t think there is too much difference other than how you control the product! You can “bake” with loose powder which keeps you from getting oily longer. Pressed powder, unless there’s a lot of fallout typically don’t give the best oil control. It depends on what you want!

58 2018-07-23 23:55:27 Asking people not to discuss something in one timeline while retweeting it into that timeline. If fans are sick of the topic why do you put it into their news feed? And if you can, why can’t others?
59 2018-07-23 23:55:16 Trumps plans to drill for oil in Alaska is horrible. It’s only to play to his oil friends he doesn’t give a shit about the animals or the land. Is there nothing he won’t screw with just for money and spite. I hope the Native people and other groups fight him all the way.
60 2018-07-23 23:55:15 No you’d wreck them , you take your weapon apart clean them with special brushes to remove residue build up of lead or brass gun powder. Then oil lightly with special oil re assemble.
61 2018-07-23 23:55:08 @maddow Trump's push to drill in Alaska refuge is just the start as you will see if Trump is allow to get his way...drill in every nat'l park. you wait it could happen. Just imagine a pic of an oil rig derrick in front of Mt. Rushmore on a postcard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

68 2018-07-23 23:54:01 So @lisamurkowski slipped in more oil drilling in Alaska. You should be ashamed of yourself and protect more wildlife. How greedy are you? You have plenty of oil @RealDonaldTrump @SHSanders45 @GOP @SenateDems @MikePenceVP @AFLCIO @CREWcrew @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr

79 2018-07-23 23:52:22 Actually they do overlap, at least in this region. Thing is, there's a price point where fracking loses money. A few years ago, it was all the rage, and earthquakes were frequent.

Then when prices dropped, they drilled and capped the wells. The ol' boom & bust oil biz.

83 2018-07-23 23:52:10 @potus, @realdonaldtrump, @GOP, @chuckgrassley, @senjoniernst @RepRodBlum We need to protest the drilling of ANWAR! Do we really need to ruin another part of the earth??? There is plenty of oil elsewhere!!!!  Respect Mother Earth!!!
84 2018-07-23 23:52:06 Just like environmental exploration of natural gas or oil, the social, psychological, and environmental cleanup impacts are not accounted for in the costs. Plus the impacts to communities in other metrics, never fully accounted for.
85 2018-07-23 23:52:04 They probably haven’t change the oil in a while, they’re still trash though.

in fact, it's why we have laws and codify standards.  we do that ("nation of laws") to specifically prevent what you wrote.

again, what classified info developed since Jan 20 2017 do *you* think Brennan or Clapper have?

Farmers are paid up to $5,000 per wind turbine, every year. Plus, the county roads don't get thrashed by constant oil tanker traffic.

It's a win win situation.
143 2018-07-23 23:42:31 fucking oil tycoons i swear to god
144 2018-07-23 23:42:28 I was so excited to eat my left over pesto linguini for lunch today, but I hate that all the oil separated and created a swimming pool for my noodles 
145 2018-07-23 23:42:18 Peak oil is still a thing.  Deferred for now by financial machinations.

Coastal damage and civil unrest from abrupt climate change may disrupt supply before production limits can fully impact price.

There's a lot of moving parts, but EROEI and depletion definitely matter.
146 2018-07-23 23:41:59 Even better is NJ style pizza. (That’s NY style with the puddles of oil poured off). 
147 2018-07-23 23:41:46 Fair enough you’re a well run club but it annoys me when people act like you don’t spend at all. Also don’t get the city hate for having “oil money” just shows that their owners are ambitious and are willing to spend shit tonnes
148 2018-07-23 23:41:40 Trump es incompatible con cosas que no sean nuclear power or oil fields. A lo sumo talvez comenta algo Mike Pence.
149 2018-07-23 23:41:37 Snake oil

Snake oil
150 2018-07-23 23:41:06 Bio oil is really helpful in clearing out the stretch marks & Lansinoh lanolin is fab for breastfeeding mums!  @BioOilUK @LansinohFamily
151 2018-07-23 23:41:05 Meanwhile ExxonMobil pumped another shit ton of oil out of west Texas and the Eagle Ford range today

So there's that
152 2018-07-23 23:40:59 Hope the day went well .Have a great night to you all .
153 2018-07-23 23:40:46 “The squeaky wheel gets the oil.”
154 2018-07-23 23:40:39 Trump threatens Iran. Destabilization in Persian Gulf. Oil prices rise. Russia benefits mightily. Makes you wonder what was discussed in #HelsinkiSummit
155 2018-07-23 23:40:38 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
156 2018-07-23 23:40:34 Please note that feeding the military industrial complex is NOT the same as supporting veterans. Let's stop deploying troops to wars for oil. That will free up resources to take proper care of existing veterans. #NoNewWars
157 2018-07-23 23:40:26 Ino there’s nothing wrong with it I’m just sayin it also plays a bit part the fact that we’ve sold top top players to fund us. Also the money is coming from a well run club not oil money like city
158 2018-07-23 23:40:25 Hey everyone, I have survived my least favorite event that happens every 3 months: pulling my car into the oil change place WITHOUT careening into the pit below

161 2018-07-23 23:40:17 This last time I took my car in was to get my oil changed and something fixed bc my car has a recall it took like 4 days.

163 2018-07-23 23:40:12 V curious as to what slim & sassy smells like? Sounds like my type of essential oil tbh
164 2018-07-23 23:39:57 Check out the Levo Oil Infuser
165 2018-07-23 23:39:55 Watch out for Trump and the EPA.  They don't care what happens to our land, Nat'l. Parks and Monuments or our people and animals.  He owes his BIG contributors in oil and gas and mining.  Takes money from Russia via NRA.  Democracy in danger.
166 2018-07-23 23:39:43 Expected a lot of soy.
167 2018-07-23 23:39:40 kalo sticky bisa pake baby oil gays

169 2018-07-23 23:39:34 Captain on an oil rig
170 2018-07-23 23:39:28 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
171 2018-07-23 23:39:07 Yeah, about those tax cuts... Expected to have a hard time deciding what to do with the extra $13 per week. Nah! Goes straight into the gas tank since oil prices shot up. #MAGA my ass!

176 2018-07-23 23:38:06 Ya what she said. Itll be way better for them to haul the bitumen and oil in big boats along the shoreline so that when a boat goes down they wont have anyway to contain the spill. Good thinking sharon.

181 2018-07-23 23:37:10 Buhari invited Senate president Dr. Bukola Saraki and promised him 3 oil wells and juicy positions but Dr. saraki turned the offer down, and Buhari ordered his arrest by IGP. Now he invited kwankwaso and if kwankwaso turn his offer down maybe he will be charged with kidnapping.

That means I gotta go back out
189 2018-07-23 23:36:14 We are exporting quite a bit of oil that can stop quickly

We can literally thumb our nose at Iran if we wish to

It’s a deal in the making obviously
190 2018-07-23 23:36:12 Yeah, blame PDU30 again for the price increase which was brought about by the increase of crude oil.

191 2018-07-23 23:36:03 Labour shafted Scotland. They stole our oil wells. Thatcher never moved oil wells into English waters. You should read up on your history. Killing pet dogs in Diego Garcia..dumping Trident in Scotland. Labour - the Dick Dastardly party! In coalition with the Tories in Scotland.
192 2018-07-23 23:36:00 Hahahahaha!!!! Just out the oil up high, problem solved. 
193 2018-07-23 23:35:40 Gotta get an oil change tomorrow
194 2018-07-23 23:35:38 It's so hot in England right now, that I opened my pot of coconut oil whilst laying in bed thinking it would be solid and the entire pot just spilt on me. I feel like a greasey chip. #chilliheatwave2018

201 2018-07-23 23:34:22 You need to add few hundreds more as special forces ops from EU & Oil gulf states.
202 2018-07-23 23:34:07 Depending on what type of oil you’re talking about..?
203 2018-07-23 23:34:02 Coconut oil & Argan oil is saving my hair. I thought I was gonna have to cut it 
204 2018-07-23 23:33:47 So if we become the top producer of gas and oil I think that will do more to destroy Russia than a stupid red button. You all are in bed with Russia (uranium 1)skolkovo etc etc
205 2018-07-23 23:33:42 Do we want peace? Do YOU? Those things Syria wants for Russia..do YOU want it for the U.S? Why should they? Russia is their ally. They worked on the relationship while WE backed the rebels that turned out to be Isis. What do you EXPECT? If this isn't about oil, give in for PEACE.
206 2018-07-23 23:33:31 At least it didn't leak oil or gasoline all over the hair extensions.

208 2018-07-23 23:33:08 @DrAricSudicky would be a good thing to point out that EO’s aren’t regulated by the FDA. So most of the time we don’t even know if what consumers are using is EO or synthetic, or just coconut oil. Major issue with adulterated products, we estimate 50-60% not what they say onlabel
209 2018-07-23 23:33:04 GARGOYLES GARGLING OIL!!!
210 2018-07-23 23:32:57 Making homemade products means I can make fun stuff like cayenne pepper oil eye cream.  

Guys, that was a REALLY DUMB idea
211 2018-07-23 23:32:43 That coconut oil 
212 2018-07-23 23:32:41 but you should try war to know it is never a good idea to meddle in another country's politics, send your troops to protect "democracy" (sorry, oil & other interests) and safely advocate for peace while supporting dictators. just born and raised in a civil war, I wouldn't know...

215 2018-07-23 23:32:11 It appears that the greed from Washington has made its way into the great state of Texas & small cities like Midland because of oil production. The President lowers taxes & the Fed raises interest rates & inflation goes rampit. I know its capitalism but when is enough, enough?
216 2018-07-23 23:32:11 it can be surreal going in a physical store when you're used to getting everything from Amazon. "oh, the coconut oil isn't in the oil section, it's in the organic section"

219 2018-07-23 23:31:50 Sticker on Airbox cover of any car I own "This air filter is less than a year old.  It does not need to be replaced.  If you remove it, bring it to me to tell me it's "Ok", or that it needs to be replaced, I may have to kill you.

Please change my oil, and let me be on my way"
220 2018-07-23 23:31:35 Like “Shock and Awe?” We know you want their oil. So just send your family over there on the front lines. Leave our’s out of it!

224 2018-07-23 23:31:06 @KaeElmer Using the older of the magnetic stirring machine for added safety and support I inverted the flask so it acted like a funnel with enough room for the magnet to spin in the neck of the flask. Net result is that in a few hours my Avocado oil turned purple and is now black
225 2018-07-23 23:31:02 leave it to me to spill oil all over the kitchen

238 2018-07-23 23:29:08 Actually helpful tips number 1. Oil baths are a great way to get super smooth and moisturize skin. Just add in a little bit of oil into your bath (I use jojoba oil and vitamin E oil) and relax. Just be careful because it does make the tub slippery. #lifehacks #helpfultips
239 2018-07-23 23:28:48 Pour that oil please

I can find my own oil change for now. Till next try

254 2018-07-23 23:26:58 How old is she? My first go to is always peppermint oil (pure therapeutic grade of course). Use proper dilution ratios. Headaches and bowels are often related. A daily probiotic will help as well

258 2018-07-23 23:26:41 It's not an ideal solution, obviously, but let's not pretend that 4.5 billion was going to be spent on any of the positive initiatives you mention. If fed gov't didn't purchase it, that cash would've been spent on unemployment benefits for out of work oil workers, not clean water
259 2018-07-23 23:26:38 Y’all ever tried CBD oil?
260 2018-07-23 23:26:31 Same as we did in Iran with their elected leader in 1953 when he got elected fairly saying he’d nationalize their oil. Then we deposed him and installed the brutal shah. They overthrew him in the 1979 revolution and took the hostages as a big FU for that. I don’t blame them
261 2018-07-23 23:26:01 Basically your position is there is no escalation of force. Only physical contact equals deadly force? There wasn't even a weapon involved until the shooter presented.
262 2018-07-23 23:26:01 And right on all that oil. Same for Venezuela.
263 2018-07-23 23:26:01 I'll say this: here in Oklahoma, most folks reject the concept of manmade climate change. At the same time, wind farms are sprouting everywhere, because the land owners make money from a wind turbine on their properties --- just like oil, only better, because cleaner.

267 2018-07-23 23:25:35 @MichaelAvenatti See pp 418-19 of David Axelrod's autobiography "Believer" for David's story about Trump, the BP oil catastrophe and Trump's collapsible White House ballroom.
268 2018-07-23 23:25:12 Looks like the Canadian oil pipeline is about to get replaced with the Marijuana Pipeline. Can't wait to see what that will look like.
269 2018-07-23 23:25:04 A serious problem is the loss of credibility such tweets engender with countries like India who depend on Iran for oil supplies. It's quite difficult to justify to the domestic public that fuel prices will skyrocket because an allied country has unstable leadership.
270 2018-07-23 23:25:02 At special request. No I would not question trumps resolve. Putin meeting imho was to set up guidelines to remove oil competition  from Iran. Yes troops on ground could happen. Hope no. Time will tell.  Hate trading lives for oil firms.  Bad all around.
271 2018-07-23 23:25:02 Do you all think Church’s should sell anointing oil ? My mom said she bought some and I feel like it should be FREE to members who are tithes and offering givers can someone help me ? What do you all think ?
272 2018-07-23 23:25:01 False narrative. Frankly, as you should know, we will first impose sanctions and dramatically reduce their ability to export oil. Then, the economy will weaken causing domestic upheaval. Then, we increase rhetoric and pressure while the regime cracks down on peaceful dissent.
273 2018-07-23 23:24:57 True. Didn’t mean to imply that. We were set on deposing him as soon as he said he’d nationalize Iraqi oil after Iran-Iraq to bring his country back from the brink
274 2018-07-23 23:24:40 And forgetting “Scottish” oil?
275 2018-07-23 23:24:24 Left in Canada: fires and trains carrying oil do not produce 'carbon' but a pipeline does. LMFAO

283 2018-07-23 23:23:12 Please, you disgust me! Obama and Hillary we very soft on Putin! Trump actually placed more sanctions,  encouraged Germany to buy oil from us, kicked out Russian ambassadors, close embassies! Obama knew about Russian involvement, yet did  nothing!

285 2018-07-23 23:22:59 Yall I just got a new moisturizing face mask AND an argan oil hair mask. I'm gonna use both tonight and I'm gonna be SO FUCKIN MOISTURIZED
286 2018-07-23 23:22:44 I heard something in my back crack as I lifted a box of argan oil onto a shelf, so I guess I’m officially old now.
287 2018-07-23 23:22:38 felt weird about using oil blotting sheets on the train platform but I turned my head to see a man in flip flops and was at peace w my decision

291 2018-07-23 23:22:28 creating oil wars and make the married ones to force there love ones to die in a Greek hospital, and letting a imposter call him self a president. what else Bill.
292 2018-07-23 23:22:27 Best/Cheapest place to get an oil change and tire rotation? via /r/Buffalo

Looking to get a full synthetic change plus tire rotation, I’m in the williamsville area but could travel a bit. Delta sonic price with coupon is $73.
293 2018-07-23 23:22:22 life sucks without olive oil
294 2018-07-23 23:22:17 Good luck with any sort of motorway through Castlecrag. The inhabitants will surely reinforce the battlements and pour boiling oil on any intruder

297 2018-07-23 23:22:13 Is it just me or is the thought of frying veggies in veggie oil just like frying them in the blood of their relatives? Vegans are #Savage.
298 2018-07-23 23:22:13 My man offered to change the oil from my car and hit me with “if there’s ANYTHING I can do for you let me know. I want to make sure you’re always good”
299 2018-07-23 23:22:08 My car is all washed and clean, oil changed, and errrthang 
300 2018-07-23 23:22:01 Nigeria is a monoeconomy (Oil) and the demand for oil is predicted to plummet below average by 2030 (IEA, 2017), due to the wake in the use, efficiency & demand for renewable energy sources. This only signals dat if Nigeria do no diversify our GDP is going 2 dwindle progressively
301 2018-07-23 23:21:45 It’s always about the oil & gas
302 2018-07-23 23:21:40 Yes but no but wait but the oil and whisky
303 2018-07-23 23:21:38 They put too much oil in my car and my engine blew up.
304 2018-07-23 23:21:33 Haven't the Houthi's already tried? I remember seeing reports of a drone attack on Saudi oil installations somewhere.
305 2018-07-23 23:21:31 @theresa_may Oil!! You useless wet blanket when are you going to sort out companies like @amazon, @Starbucks etc etc and get them to pay the proper tax so the country can have enough money to fix itself! Grow a pair of balls to go with your moustache!!

307 2018-07-23 23:21:18 Sounds good till you realize Trump is not for alternative fuels/energy. Plus as we all know you like your $$$ from oil companies. So how about push for our state to expand medicaid so those farmers/ranchers your putting out of business can have healthcare while they go bankrupt.
308 2018-07-23 23:21:11 1.) Syria can choose their own allies and partners.
2.) We have many bases, many of which are heavily opposed in their respected countries. Russia can too, & they have very few outside Russia. 
3.) Syria can do what they wish with their oil & needs.

What are you talking about?
309 2018-07-23 23:20:59 Finally done... 3 plus hours later I’m finally done with her car... Oil change tune up and replaced the battery in 114 degree weather... but in my garage it felt like 130 
310 2018-07-23 23:20:57 suits最高だよなわかる。
311 2018-07-23 23:20:37 Well I'm pleased. I washed the smoke out of my hair. Had a quick bon fire and hashbrown patties. Then later on I tried boiling, and pan frying them with cajun, it was good and tasty, better, kind of like that oil free fries :D too tired to take selfie, dark under eyes.
312 2018-07-23 23:20:19 That is fucked up... Steve, the situation in Iran was not where it is until Netanyahu said that Iran needed to be whacked. Now Trump is blowing harder each day about it, and wants to whip our his dong to get his Trumpian Stooges all fired up. Restore the Iranian oil Treaty.
313 2018-07-23 23:20:02 crude oil babe she will be 
314 2018-07-23 23:19:59 yesss!! it went front hat to just brows and lashes now to just lashes. done getting extensions for now bc they break my natural lashes  trying castor oil
315 2018-07-23 23:19:50 Even Hillary seems to agree with Rouhani that the US created ISIS. And ISIS conveniently, and according to plan, got the US the oil rich region of Syria. They kept going exactly to where the US wanted to claim oil wells, looked like a staged war to me.
316 2018-07-23 23:19:30 Rand Paul is a slimy little worm! Probably supporting the hottest year on four continents across the world records falling like dominoes! Trump NRA money exclamation point gas and oil money flowing into his bank account I think we're past the point of no return. God help us!
317 2018-07-23 23:19:20 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
318 2018-07-23 23:19:19 False flag attack to demonize Islam and Muslims.  Be very careful in reading fakenews.  It was proven he had mental health trouble and doctors refused to help him like so many others.

319 2018-07-23 23:19:11 When the RX meds, Excedrine Migraine, Salon Pas patch, essential oil inhaler and prayer is not touching the pain—-it’s a chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese sandwich kind of night 
320 2018-07-23 23:18:59 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
321 2018-07-23 23:18:57 Sorry, I should have phrased that differently, my view on the palm oil comes from a biodiversity standpoint as I think that is as important for a healthy planet, and ecosystems under threat from palm oil are much smaller and harder to protect large areas.
322 2018-07-23 23:18:48 Isn't it canola oil where you live?
323 2018-07-23 23:18:39 But I rly like the aveeno creamy oat oil better than pcb.
324 2018-07-23 23:18:31 That and how does a snake oil salesman become the @potus ?
325 2018-07-23 23:18:30 That's how I feel about my forehead the whole year....
Could make a bottle of oil with all the sweat....
326 2018-07-23 23:18:30 I will buy your olive oil. Following you now.
327 2018-07-23 23:18:20 Oil ...
328 2018-07-23 23:18:17 Companies literally richer than countries such as #Ghana, mine. But my country has #Human #Resources, #gold, #oil, #gas #cocoa #radio #spectrum Where did we go wrong?
329 2018-07-23 23:18:11 The best thing I’ve done to make food cook and taste better is be liberal with how much olive oil I use. To the tune of 4-5x what I use to use. 

Also, with no other changes, I’ve been getting jacked, leaner, and tan.

This is probably not good advice for most.
330 2018-07-23 23:18:08 You claim to be a finance expert. Would you be so kind to provide a detailed EV demand elasticity model based on oil price. As you know the world is headed into another possible Oil Shock or at the very least a substantial increase in oil price due to constrained supply.
331 2018-07-23 23:18:01 I've got a lot of oil sellers. Some go to the national convention. One goes through all the selling schemes. There's a wine company one. One did melaleuca for awhile. What a shit show. She told me I was going to get CEU's for a thing and it was god damn sales scheme. Ugh.
332 2018-07-23 23:17:55 You think these people chain themselves to their local petrol station to protest big oil? 
This pisses me off, excessive packaging annoys retail workers as much as anyone, probs more infact, since much like faux woke, middle-class folk, it makes our under valued job even harder!
333 2018-07-23 23:17:31 I’m sure the families of the two guys who were killed in the explosion due to the unchecked oil industry would feel differently
334 2018-07-23 23:17:31 kalea brought this greasy ass pizza my hands look like straight baby oil
335 2018-07-23 23:17:21 As such, its a pawn of US & western imperialism, the exact same thing that destroyed your democratic system in 1953 and replaced the democratically elected leader who only sought to make Iran prosper instead of the anglo oil monopoly.
336 2018-07-23 23:17:02 Obvio, este ya no tiene cara, un tremendo lacra y cargador, o sea @cuervotinelli que Page a todas esas familias que dejó en la calle, a mi no me va a decir que no sabía con quién se asociaba si el hasta la publicidad de la estación de servicio les hizo oil , besitos grande!!!

338 2018-07-23 23:17:00 I found one called bio oil it literally works it’s so amazing
339 2018-07-23 23:16:53 Miniature gnocchi and mushrooms pan fried in butter and a little bit of truffle oil and then tossed in an asiago cream sauce.

I am so flipping proud of myself.
340 2018-07-23 23:16:53 Lots of money in Arctic oil for Russians...And for Rex's Exxon...expanding oil fields as the Arctic Icecap melts...Global Warming is good...stop conservation efforts and drill...Rex bails early...smart...What a tight bunch of friends.
341 2018-07-23 23:16:53 goals include looking like a ripened tomato
insulting the tactical wear of soldiers
participating in the crooked olive oil industry

343 2018-07-23 23:16:31 So when my dad 1st got sick he was so against it. And as the traditional methods failed and opioids were the only solution he relented. He has the oil, and is trying acupuncture. I give him credit, guys his age are unwilling to bend
344 2018-07-23 23:16:29 Aww honey.. I can change tires, oil, filters, battery, and change out spark plugs and do all basic matinence on my cars... it was required before I ever got my first car (dad's rule) (honey is directed at wyz..)
345 2018-07-23 23:16:24 I spilled coconut oil all over in my car
346 2018-07-23 23:16:08 I guess? We got.... Oil... And... Energy? Move out this way lol
347 2018-07-23 23:16:06 I did it the old fashioned way - tweezers after starving the little critter of O2 with oil - sterilise with 47.5 alcohol (gin)

350 2018-07-23 23:15:40 What if the voices in my head speak a different language?
That's okay right?
351 2018-07-23 23:14:52 Omgggg!!!!!!!!! Just found the cutest recipe for a summer shimmer body oil! Just use oil and eye shadow    Can't wait to try!! 
352 2018-07-23 23:14:48 Kerrygold butter, cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, coconut oil and avocado!
353 2018-07-23 23:14:45 We don’t need the Middle East for oil. We have our own high quality in TX  and from other parts in the USA. TX is becoming the leading natural oil producer. Dump OPEC! Thanks to our great President Mr. @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst
354 2018-07-23 23:14:43 実際めっちゃ引っ張られた感じがありますねwww
355 2018-07-23 23:14:40 EXTREME VETTING!!!!!

An Islamic immigrant to NY is charged with mowing down & killing 8  people with a truck.  
At his court hearing, he said, “The Islamic State is not fighting for  land... or for oil. They have one purpose, & they’re fighting to impose Sharia on earth.”
356 2018-07-23 23:14:15 That’s that coconut oil sis 
357 2018-07-23 23:14:12 I’m somewhat lactose intolerant but I love ice cream, fresh cream cakes and clotted cream on my scones; prefer butter to olive oil on my bread, milk chocolates to dark ones ... and I eat beef, infrequently, but still do ...
358 2018-07-23 23:13:56 Iran is aligned with Russia. US sanctions benefit Russia by giving Russians unmatched access to Iranian markets and Iranian oil. There will be no war unless Putin allows it, and that’s not likely. Trump’s tweets are just noise.
359 2018-07-23 23:13:35 I hope the oil wells are in the north Becos the ones in the south are dedicated to Gods children. We cannot suffer everything in Nigeria & still lose our oil wells. Trust me time will fix this
360 2018-07-23 23:13:09 Palm oil is arguably worse in terms of impact, but that’s a valid point too, the less meat we eat generally the better for the env. As I’ve learned more about impacts I’ve cut my consumption drastically, even though I probably won’t be able to eliminate it (meat’s yum)
361 2018-07-23 23:13:08 Breakfast food. Ocean. And weirdly, motor oil.
362 2018-07-23 23:13:01 What did you include? Mine has seven ingredients:

1. Fresh basil
2. Walnuts (pine nuts are too pasty)
3. Strong garlic
4. Lemon juice
5. Hard Italian cheese (Parma, Asiago, or Romano)
6. Olive oil
7. Salt

I eat 20 pounds of it every summer, mostly on heirloom tomato sandwiches.
363 2018-07-23 23:12:41 I vote for hemp oil for my salad
364 2018-07-23 23:12:36 This is what the Democrat socialists and the left wingers want for America.  Chavez started out a socialist and became a dictator that destroyed the oil rich countries economy.
365 2018-07-23 23:12:31 i wish my family could blend in w/ eachother but this shit like water and oil
366 2018-07-23 23:12:19 I bought some coconut oil to use as lube and it’s great except it smells exactly like almond joy and makes me starving the instant I open it
367 2018-07-23 23:11:51 You shouldn't act surprised, Marco! Putin landgrabbed Crimea without permission, is working on the rest if Ukraine, and needs OIL bc the Russian economy is poor.
368 2018-07-23 23:11:50 Silence you lying Big Pharma Henchman. We know the medical community has had the cure for cancer for decades now. 

Even the people figured out a few cures:

Cannabis Oil
Vitamin B17 (banned by the FDA for curing cancer)

PS: Big Pharma is giving us cancer through vaccines.
369 2018-07-23 23:11:44 I saw this and just laughed. Nigeria has not been able to tackle Oil Pipe Line Vandalism is the S/S that is Within Nigeria). what are the security measures put in place to ensure there's no vandalism of the pipes from Niger to Nigeria ?
370 2018-07-23 23:11:34 Me: oil and garlic

372 2018-07-23 23:11:28 I take our 550mg CBD oil for my anxiety/c-ptsd and it helps a lot! Definitely  not  oil  I can give you a coupon if you like 
373 2018-07-23 23:11:26 been told I should try this oil x
374 2018-07-23 23:11:17 彼はよく足を運ぶし泥臭く動いてるけど、政策は親父似なのかぁ…
折角認知度は高いんだしもうちょい勉強して国の役に立って欲しいね
375 2018-07-23 23:11:10 Religious right one Israeli state apocaltptic loons have more power over more lawmakers than AIPAC. Carter was right. Our addiction to cheap ME oil is a nat’l security risk and risk to planet
376 2018-07-23 23:10:55 Haha! Me too, like once every three years instead of every three months.

Same for paying someone else to change the oil on my vehicles at the recommended mileage.

Or having washed all dirty laundry.
377 2018-07-23 23:10:48 Please tell me these chips are just flavored with fucking olive oil
378 2018-07-23 23:10:42 Fox News is propaganda
379 2018-07-23 23:10:36 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
380 2018-07-23 23:10:20 This may not be met well... however I'm going to say it anyways (lol)... 80% of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest (one of the largest carbon sinks in the world) is for cattle. If we eat less meat, we can impact the largest reason for deforestation. (palm oil contributes too)
381 2018-07-23 23:10:20 Good. Then get the F*%& out of NATO and don't let the door hit you in the A$$. And see how long your leadership role in the EU lasts. See what happens when Putin cuts off ur oil supply. Don't come crying to us. Your welcome for 3/4 of a century of keeping Russia at bay
382 2018-07-23 23:10:17 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
383 2018-07-23 23:10:13 Anybody notice the Trump is trying to drive up the price oil and at the same time Eliminate I ran from the oil market?
Funny how this will help Putin more than anyone
384 2018-07-23 23:10:13 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
385 2018-07-23 23:10:00 I fucking wish! I gotta get through this oil change w him. Love you 
386 2018-07-23 23:09:50 Being an adult and getting an oil change 
387 2018-07-23 23:09:48 We're becoming the #1 exporter or oil and gas
Analiated a brigade of Russian mercs in Syria
Moving against russian allies Assad and Iran
Demanding NATO to spend more
Chastising Germany for buying NG from Russia.
When will we hear what trump is doing to help Russia? I'm waiting.
388 2018-07-23 23:09:42 I’m really disappointed no one said they would go back in time to the California gold rush or to become an oil tycoon
389 2018-07-23 23:09:32 これなんか前の死刑の時に水道法と被せて発表してたって噂も出てきたぞ……

最近間髪入れずにヤバイニュース出すぎじゃにゃいか？
390 2018-07-23 23:08:49 I found this oil stuff for my face and I squeezed the package and it exploded and some of it landed on my phone. my phone is duck taped so like the screen is lifted a little bit from the phone and some of the oli got into it. So now i can see oil in my phone through the screen
391 2018-07-23 23:08:43 But last time I was told they're begging him with SP and oil block how come it lead to this??
392 2018-07-23 23:08:39 Drowning myself in tanning oil today
393 2018-07-23 23:08:28 Hay trump so when u destroy Iran's oil base economy and we pay a higher gas prices. are we going to have another migrant crisis in Iran just like Libya and Venezuela.
394 2018-07-23 23:08:16 [sweats] uhm my favorite new release is still OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES i have a lot of feelings about “Is It Cold in the Water?” It’s like.... reimagined Kate Bush
395 2018-07-23 23:07:50 Birch ply is great to paint on. If you are using oil, I definitely recommend at least one good coat of gesso. Acrylic doesn’t need it, and gouache works better over a ground (daniel smith has nice ones). Stay away from cedar, it bleeds like crazy.
396 2018-07-23 23:07:43 Don’t think it’s all about oil they are clutching onto the last bit of their empire can’t emphasise how much their Scottish estates mean!
397 2018-07-23 23:07:34 .The irony dripping from Pompeo's Iran "great economy, but only for the elite" speech...is as thick as crude oil
398 2018-07-23 23:07:03 Bruh na. You look greasy in winter with all that coconut oil 
399 2018-07-23 23:07:02 Look at the oil and gasoline  (Koch's and mercers) and didn't he get a ton of cash from the Saudis?
400 2018-07-23 23:06:41 I am literally in a essential oil group and dead ass someone LAST NIGHTasked what oils to use to KILL CANCER.
401 2018-07-23 23:06:33 I was about to run all of these errands & I get to the car dealership for an oil change & now I’m sleepy.. so I’m done for the day. Time to go home
402 2018-07-23 23:06:26 Like a library. Nice. Do we need a librations too, oil the works, keep everyone in line?
403 2018-07-23 23:06:18 Me, always me. Then I arrive and freak out coz I've forgotten my cleansing oil or such.
404 2018-07-23 23:06:14 Violence begets violence. When someone physically asserts themselves onto another, the intended victim should view that action as a life-threatening situation, and act accordingly. I appreciate your comments, but I stand by my earlier position.
405 2018-07-23 23:06:13 Yet beautiful oil paintings on wood panel that deatured dark, dimly lit areas from our area. Each of his paintings sold for $400-$600. Hr explained their prices as such: "Artists choose a starting price. It reflects their obscurity, newness...and also the time put into (2/3)
406 2018-07-23 23:06:04 The gold and the oil was already there it just took for someone to find it. Apple and google had to be created and there’s no guarantee it’ll take off under you like it did under their founders.
407 2018-07-23 23:06:02 The problem with politics and intelligence is they r like water & oil.they don’t mix without surfactant like mustard in salad dressing @ErinBurnett @outfront NEthing with politics just tastes bad
....great evening, Emonkey
408 2018-07-23 23:05:53 In fairness to the argument, there are plenty of medical herbs that can be used in place of OTC meds with varying results that could be classified under herbalism.

But, considering the OP of the tweet is a clear snake oil salesman, I think we know what he's really selling.
409 2018-07-23 23:05:46 Do you know whether the garlic culprits are oil soluble? Inulin, for example, isn't. Considered garlic-infused oil? I live on that stuff.
410 2018-07-23 23:05:30 We’re in Israel for 2 reasons. Eliminate these issues, problem solved. 1. To keep our eye on “our middle eastern oil,” (note quotation marks) and 2. Keep access to the Suez Canal, without which, all trade to east Asia stops and our economy would collapse
411 2018-07-23 23:05:16 And niggas is saying they’ll go back in time and inventing google or Apple lmao nigga I’ll go way back and discover the gold in California and all those oil reserves throughout the American Southwest ya really bugging
412 2018-07-23 23:05:02 I really love people who brag about being super tan and lather on tanning oil. Gonna be great when your skin looks like beef jerky.
413 2018-07-23 23:04:59 the fact that being an adult is such a foreign concept.........to adults.......is ridiculous. i may suck at making sure my car’s oil is changed regularly and still occasionally burn dinner, but at least i’m respectful, patient, and moderately mature WOW
414 2018-07-23 23:04:49 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
415 2018-07-23 23:04:34 Trump has been talking about attacking Iran and taking over the oil fields since 1987.  It is in @harryhurtiii book Lost Tycoon
416 2018-07-23 23:04:22 I’ve always wanted to try that body oil, what’re your thoughts?
417 2018-07-23 23:04:13 Ever spilled tea tree oil in your eye on accident? It’s not fun. I don’t recommend it ever.
418 2018-07-23 23:04:04 Take a look at how the oil market reacted today to his all CAPS. There is a brilliant method to his madness.  I'll take that response over shipping them money just to be behave.

421 2018-07-23 23:03:34 It's all from sports radio commercials. The only thing I use is CBD oil
422 2018-07-23 23:03:21 Combo right, you'd want one that suits all skin Mine was very VERY dry so I had the ultra dry one lol, but try Ultra Facial Moisturiser (cheaper) or Rare Earth Pore lotion as lightweight, oil-free and that one contains White Clay which absorbs excess oil and mattes naturally
423 2018-07-23 23:03:08 foreign denomination debt.  Oil income stream would underpin that and reduce int rate &  'keep the lights on' a bit longer. 
WM understand all this much better than I. So preserving the oil revenue is the first last and only game in town for them.

426 2018-07-23 23:02:45 Is there an oil I can use for my daughters headaches?@iammrssamuels
427 2018-07-23 23:02:43 Have you tried tinctures yet? They're a faster acting edible for all day use! The Nu 1:1 grapeseed oil based tincture is 20% off this week!
428 2018-07-23 23:02:33 #getuninvitedin4words Try this essential oil
429 2018-07-23 23:02:29 I agree. Also with the oil companies and big pharma.
430 2018-07-23 23:01:53 jojoba oil feels so good on the skin
431 2018-07-23 23:01:48 You know its warm when your coconut oil has already melted...
432 2018-07-23 23:01:46 Iran is chipping practice before breakfast. It should have been made a waste land 35 years ago. Bomb it into a puddle of oil. See if that dead prophet and god that never was can help them then.
433 2018-07-23 23:01:43 Don't mind me, I'm just washing this plastic deli container lid that I dug out of the trash because I thought I could finish this whole container of olives and feta in olive oil but I was wrong.
434 2018-07-23 23:01:41 For logs and oil. This ‘admin’ sucks.
435 2018-07-23 23:01:39 頑張れ！！！
436 2018-07-23 23:01:29 Russia is in bed with Iran, so is Israel. Iran is shiite, so is Syria, Iran has borders with Russia. All the other parties are sunni. During sanctions time, Iran made deals with Russia ( to export oil thru them) and PRC. In a nutshell, and Turkey’s playing everyone.
437 2018-07-23 23:01:17 So we show how we are getting ripped off by oil companies price fixing!
438 2018-07-23 23:01:10 I used to paint in oil on 1/4" lauan plywood, primed with acrylic gesso. The paintings don't seem to have deteriorated at all in 20 years or so.

444 2018-07-23 23:00:26 Roasted tomatoes w/olive oil + parmesan taste like pizza. You could even add Italian seasoning and/or oregano. FYI.
445 2018-07-23 23:00:25 So many snake oil salesmen on this thread.
446 2018-07-23 23:00:08 Got a new pen & new oil and I’m on a whole nother level right now.
447 2018-07-23 23:00:00 Y’all wanna know why men ain’t shit? My dad would always ask for money to fix shit in the car and when I got it none of those problems where fixed. He hadn’t gotten a oil change or anything
448 2018-07-23 22:59:43 Love Northtown Kia for the free cookies when you wait for an oil change. BUT apparently they aren’t here for 7pm appointments. And this lady chowing on Taco Bell next to me is *pissed* about it.
449 2018-07-23 22:59:42 For example: “Well, have you tried tea tree oil on the insides of your wrists?”
450 2018-07-23 22:59:42 Lavender essential oil! Just make sure to get a pure oil, costs more but is much safer. DoTERRA or Young Living. I put it on my temples and behind my ears!!
451 2018-07-23 22:59:34 Swanging Johnson like baby oil, ever since '93 
452 2018-07-23 22:59:27 castor oil and stair climbing
453 2018-07-23 22:59:18 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
454 2018-07-23 22:59:17 Apart from the fact that countries without the resources to "pour money" into sorting things suffered no problems. You were a snake oil salesman that's all. No better than the sellers of digital arials.
455 2018-07-23 22:59:02 Coconut oil has been shown to help grow hair.
456 2018-07-23 22:59:02 Salt Lake City has a law where if you’re moving to Utah for tax reasons, you must remain a Lakers fan so you can be easily identified and shunned
457 2018-07-23 22:58:47 Says the man who pished oil road the entire coast road when he knew he had a leak.
458 2018-07-23 22:58:41 Motor oil works great for a hair follicle moisturizer. Y’all should try it!
459 2018-07-23 22:58:37 Yes. Just like they did in Iraq.
Oh...wait.
Wake up. Our wars are *never* about liberating anyone.
If we go to war with Iran, there’s another reason. Probably oil.
460 2018-07-23 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
461 2018-07-23 22:58:27 Hey Brits that’s called Global Warming due to Climate Change. Remember oil and Carbon generation millions cars?! Enjoy some of consequences! More to come yet. @NatGeo @EPAAWheeler @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may
462 2018-07-23 22:58:22 Prevention and preemption more precisely always deals with what if, without exception.
Being early and erring on side of caution is far superior to being late.
463 2018-07-23 22:58:20 What is the last food item that you've put in a book?  One of mine,  most would recognize as Panzanella. Take the dry, week old half-loaf and run it under water.  Add olive oil, salt, pepper and oregano.  An invention due to necessity during poorer times. "Wet Bread".  #amwriting
464 2018-07-23 22:58:15 I need some tea tree oil
465 2018-07-23 22:58:04 Use coconut oil and castor oil!!!!!
466 2018-07-23 22:57:49 Loves you too Hun. Sleep well.  Get some lavender oil on your pillow, a wee fountain and some sea sounds and you will be away. Make sure you have eaten first too.  A full tummy helps.   I am off to sleep.  Sweet dreams. 
467 2018-07-23 22:57:49 I've used oil on untreated pine planks from a home project. I didn't seal any of those pieces, though I ought to have. Plywood seems too porous, but it wouldn't hurt to get a small piece and experiment before starting. You may also want to steer clear of treated wood.
468 2018-07-23 22:57:33 Boil them first then add a moderate amount of salt.
Grate tomatoes about 2/3
Dice onions till relatively small
Fry the worms preferably with olive oil it really brings out the flavor 
Add the onions and then tomatoes, add minestrone preferably the original one. Add aromat.
469 2018-07-23 22:57:31 They'll never grant an S30. 
They will restrict HR further and do small scale harassment. 
More powers move to UK gov in Scot. 
Try and force SNP into UDI.  English police and troops if necessary. 
Think Catalonia as a blue print. 
Oil underpins the £.
470 2018-07-23 22:57:25 oh du Jogi..was du wirklich gemeint: In good times, we need to sell cars  with manipulated software to many many black people outside germany,  but in bad times we need money from Oil Sheikhs and also support our @Afd and @CSU freunde

475 2018-07-23 22:56:54 I got a new THC capsule for my oil pen and it’s supposed to taste like peaches and cream but it honestly tastes like a nail salon so :-/
476 2018-07-23 22:56:40 Last year when I was working in oil field the ac went out in my lab and my boss told me to man the fuck up or fix it 
477 2018-07-23 22:56:23 I know. EXPAND the social safety net. FORGIVE student debt. Tax the wealthy and Corporations 40%. Make all public sector workers tax exempt. Make BIG OIL and BIG Pharma Highly regulated with Higher taxes especially CARBON. Ban plastic everything. Make minimum wage 22.00 per hr.
478 2018-07-23 22:56:22 nothing like taking your car in for a $25 oil change and coming back to a $500 bill :)))) Happy monday 
479 2018-07-23 22:56:11 Its all snake oil. Mental health treatment is still in the "blood letting" stage of its development, comparatively speaking.

481 2018-07-23 22:55:46 Maybe because he is trying to repair a damaged relationship.

BTW, Trump's actions are by far more confrontational towards Russia than anything Obama did...  Ask yourself why?

Even his criticism of Germany, about using Russian oil, is not in Putin's best interest.
482 2018-07-23 22:55:46 Ali oil and prawn pil pil.  every day 
483 2018-07-23 22:55:42 Trump withdrew from the Iranian deal.  Iran has quite a bit more leverage by dumping U.S. dollars for oil deals and using euros instead.
484 2018-07-23 22:55:28 Tea Tree Oil leaves my face feeling smoooooooooth 
485 2018-07-23 22:55:13 mmmm yummy! You can make just about anything with our oil or isolate  wanna coupon?
486 2018-07-23 22:55:11 The cable was like $4 on Amazon and I had a gift card so I said "fuck it." Also got a long HDMI so I can run my 4th monitor, as well as a new shock mount and sock for my mic, AND an oil filter for my motorcycle.
487 2018-07-23 22:54:58 Di sa ingon nga ga arte2 ko. 
Gapa less oil ko kay tungod ang mantika na gy gamit ninyo gykan sa carbon. Di veg oil. Yawa
488 2018-07-23 22:54:47 That’s wonderful news, Ben. We need oil, too, just not too much, haha. - Leslie
489 2018-07-23 22:54:31 Not being able to make their dreams come true and send them to a collective is the bitter price we all pay for our liberty.
490 2018-07-23 22:54:25 RT Mangan150: Epidemiological and blood level evidence strongly supports a protective effect of fish and fish oil.

In my opinion, discouraging people from having decent levels of omega-3 will cause harm. RT
491 2018-07-23 22:54:24 Does anyone on here paint with acrylic, oil, or gouache on wood?

-What kind of wood do you use? 
-What do you seal the wood with?
-Do you use whole pieces of wood or plywood/osb? 
-Is it a bad idea to use plywood/osb?
492 2018-07-23 22:54:18 It's fucking hotmy car decided to over heat. I need an oil change and a weave change asap .

You can never win
496 2018-07-23 22:53:10 Usually can get away with a damp cloth if it's seasoned/non-stick. Quick rinse in soapy water for messier jobs and salt scrub if anything is stuck in the pan. Oil it down periodically in between uses.
497 2018-07-23 22:53:08 Pasta, oil and garlic...I can live off of for the rest of my life
498 2018-07-23 22:53:04 Would you rather have Oil consumption or A system for interrogating a tire sensor?
499 2018-07-23 22:52:43 Mr Ayatollah, a word of advice - don’t take on America - you will lose - badly! Remember, you struggled against Iraq, do you want the US to take over your oil fields? Or maybe Israel?

505 2018-07-23 22:51:40 I mean the price of oil doesnt mean any more than the price of coffee in Turkey now that Venezuela’s economy has already collapsed.

512 2018-07-23 22:51:08 Haiii. Tekstur dia agak melekit tapi dia cepat absorb dekat kulit. Tapi best sbb jerawat kecut (sbb ada tea tree oil) and scar akan makin pudar. Pores pun makin mengecil. Tapi yg best moisturizer ni oil free! So far I pakai ok and I’m happy with the result 
513 2018-07-23 22:51:06 There is a lot of evangelicals in America waiting for the second coming of Christ! The belief that the Jewish people return to the holy land will usher this in. Ultimately they are using the state for their own gain! Plus it’s a foothold for America to stay close to all that oil.
514 2018-07-23 22:51:03 Black Jamaica castor oil. It’ll take a couple weeks but you will see results
515 2018-07-23 22:51:01 I never met a vegetable I didn't like, I've met plenty of them that were prepared in a way that made me not like them, but man if you cook any veggie right, mind blown. I just had a piece of roasted broccoli, nothing but salt and olive oil, it blew me away!
516 2018-07-23 22:50:47 Ok one last question, when Alaska become a state it gaves us gold mining and then oil , Hawaii was a good place for military half way point to Asia . Who gains more from Puerto Rico becoming a state , you or the mainland ? I mean no disrespect.... just facts .nice talking to you
517 2018-07-23 22:50:46 Laisses oil tranquille, c'est pas un hôtel chez lui !

519 2018-07-23 22:50:35 Mental health issues can emerge as a result of early unregulated cannabis use but the underlying mental health issue has to "be there" in first place. As I've said ive been there done that got the T shirt. Lived it and breathed it for over 15 years. Cannabis oil has THC removed

521 2018-07-23 22:50:18 What’s the best way to clean after use?  I’ve heard salt and oil.
522 2018-07-23 22:50:14 It will get worse unless you bother to listen to scientist who actually know what they’re talking about when it comes to global warming, rather than your billionaire oil and gas donors!
523 2018-07-23 22:50:13 Oh I’m getting it mixed up with Mustard oil  I don’t use anything 
524 2018-07-23 22:50:04 Cannabis oil/RSO is all that helps really no meds do? But I broke my neck at 26, thus yrs of pain meds. I just wanna feel comfortable? And 200mg ain’t doing it anymore- everything has a ceiling unfortunately. Wish you relief and healing as well as  we all need that!
525 2018-07-23 22:50:00 I’ve been here since 3 and still waiting for my car than hasn’t been started yet... this is why I hate getting oil changes 
526 2018-07-23 22:49:59 i’m considering soaking my body in baby oil before going down water slides bc i always get stuck. i wear bathing suit shorts but they cause me to stop and idk why!! it’s so traumatizing! 
527 2018-07-23 22:49:26 MMM more than EMR, thinking EMR could get a bump on oil & gas investments plus they've got a nice large projects backlog (per 1Q release call), but given the divergence in the industrials. they all have me nervous. MMM just most pressing given that they report tomorrow.
528 2018-07-23 22:49:20 Iran is our problem. They are a surrogate for the  plans for the oil fields and shipping lanes.  Red Dawn is a scenario that would be a lot harder if Islamic forces along with Communist forces insurgencies decided it was time to hit us. Thank God, for President Trump.
529 2018-07-23 22:49:17 so your issue is with current employees?

what classified info developed since Jan 20 2017 do *you* think Brennan or Clapper have?

bc the "what if" thing is a pretty deep rabbit hole.  and they only defense is "show the receipts, don't just indulge in flights of 'what if'"
530 2018-07-23 22:49:17 You realize military spending and oil production can happen independently from our Russian policy, yes? And Trump kissed Putin’s ass last week, yes?
531 2018-07-23 22:49:14 Oil, always about oil with these dudes. Does Iranian Oil some how threaten ARAMCO going public  (The wahabbi's).

539 2018-07-23 22:48:45 Is Trump attempting to kill us off so oil companies can profit?

541 2018-07-23 22:48:18 These issues are trivial. What have they got to do with world peace?
Sanctions are not effective. They cause countries to get away from dollar punnishment. The petrodollar is in decline. Russia and China trade for oil outside the dollar. So does Iran and Venezuela...
542 2018-07-23 22:48:17 Nope! Literally nothing. Going to to this CBD oil/product (will probs flop )

545 2018-07-23 22:47:52 The biggest problem is Global Leaders aren’t interested in sustainable energy, because unlike oil it doesn’t cause wars.
Their primary interest is their name in the history books, not the long term sustainability of the planet for everyone.

548 2018-07-23 22:47:22 I agree unregulated cannabis use in the young can be dangerous, I also have personal experience. Cannabis oil regulated in my opinion is a cure to some
549 2018-07-23 22:47:14 Ewu, after he refuse to accept oil well n automatic ticket from ur hero, then another turn on murder. From where, wen.
550 2018-07-23 22:46:52 How is it that I ALWAYS get tanning oil in my eyes?
551 2018-07-23 22:46:47 There are some pretty huge assumptions in your starting position. Not least the oil revenues which were constructed by Osborne to undermine the case. Other countries continued to collect revenues from oil companies, just not U.K. Don’t confuse Tory taxation policy with revenue.

556 2018-07-23 22:46:21 Lol #UKOG is just starting out .. who knows where it could end up.. yes it may fail but it could also boom..the main thing is there is OIL coming out! Slow and steady and the gush like a horny slut! Everyone will want a piece then wont they
557 2018-07-23 22:46:21 We have more oil than iran. Texas is full of it and gives the country about half of its oil, in the billions of gallons.
558 2018-07-23 22:46:18 What is more important? RT for beard oil. Like for gun oil.
559 2018-07-23 22:46:08 Today for lunch I had baby broccoli roasted in olive oil. Okay it was drenched in the stuff! With a side (big helping) of pasta :)
560 2018-07-23 22:45:44 It was unlocked because the company (an oil company) was moving new a new HQ and the bins were unlocked so people could throw in mass quantities of paper to shred. He said it would have ruined the $30,000 shredder on his truck. The guilty party was a company executive!!! 
561 2018-07-23 22:45:41 Wine taste like car oil.. 

I said what I said.
562 2018-07-23 22:45:28 I hate when people be having on too much oil 
563 2018-07-23 22:45:26 I'll buy it off you. I have the fairy garden oil and it's my favorite! Sucks that you're allergic :(
564 2018-07-23 22:44:49 I have known him for thirty years-he is a man of faith and integrity. He operates in a Senior Management position in a large oil and gas company. He has survived every staff cull since the GFC. He is no idiot.
565 2018-07-23 22:44:47 i got oil in my eye and i want to die
566 2018-07-23 22:44:41 あるあるやわｗｗ
もう見事な蜘蛛の巣ですが大丈夫！動くから！()
567 2018-07-23 22:44:12 We have Oyel dear, not Oil
568 2018-07-23 22:44:08 it would be hell on earth. global oil shortages would force China's hand in the SCS, bolster Russia's with the EU, and America would get a bruised knee and bloody knuckles
569 2018-07-23 22:44:00 i use the deva curl products, I need it to grow first before i cut it i don't want it too short :( but ima try castor oil.
570 2018-07-23 22:43:38 It beats motor oil all over your shirt.
571 2018-07-23 22:43:31 I strongly encourage all Daily Mail readers to completely ignore any sun related health warnings. Go out in it. Baste yourself in olive oil. Lie on the roof of the tallest most reflective building you can find.
572 2018-07-23 22:43:13 *Inside the mind of a customer*
Oh I see you close in an hour....it'd be a shame if I wanted a rotate and balance..with an oil change and a..fuel injection.
573 2018-07-23 22:42:50 わーー！珈琲さんおたんじょうび…！おめでとうございます…！
574 2018-07-23 22:42:40 Dunno if Grandpa still has 1950’s thinking on oil and renewable energy advances or just “set in his ways”. Apparently renewables are hogwash
575 2018-07-23 22:42:36 Good luck betot titit aing soalnya dah pake baby oil~
576 2018-07-23 22:42:34 "ok google why is it called olive oil instead of olive sauce"
577 2018-07-23 22:42:34 however , urban skin rx 3 in 1 cleaner and bio oil is my life saver 
578 2018-07-23 22:42:18 Jews good. Zionism bad. Global banking mafia masquerading as Jews to seize Palastinian territories and take control of oil wealth in the Golan Heights.
579 2018-07-23 22:41:48 フレグランス買いたい……猫様によくないから
580 2018-07-23 22:41:47 thin crust pizza is so gross all u can taste is the cheese and oil
581 2018-07-23 22:41:42 You know how when your mom or dad tried to make you eat eggplants that one time and it was just kind of a soggy unpalatable mush?

The trick is to use a LOT of oil.
582 2018-07-23 22:41:42 My Israeli salad took 30 minutes to make. (Persian cukes, red onion, yellow pepper, tomatoes, parsley, mint, fresh basil, olive oil, lemon...)
583 2018-07-23 22:41:40 Bottom line is.#leather. when utilise will not only impact positively on the economy it will invariably create jobs.but successive gvts in  Nigeria be it states or FG haven't made any sincere efforts to diversify the economy.And here we are dependent on oil.
584 2018-07-23 22:41:38 @timseymour @CNBCFastMoney CBD Oil is huge out here in CA - Tim is right Tim is right Tim is right "going higher"
585 2018-07-23 22:41:26 so I started cleaning my face with ONLY water and then using bio oil after and my skin looks amazingggggg
586 2018-07-23 22:41:15 You're right in that there are billionaires trying to wreck the world for their own benefit. Its the people against Net Neutrality, climate change deniers who just so happen to run big coal and oil, etc. So good on you for realizing that much at least.
587 2018-07-23 22:41:07 確かに･･･何のOILかハッキリ言えよ事案ね･･･(RT)
588 2018-07-23 22:41:04 He will be in for a rude awaking when he discovers that doctor at the Houston Medical Center that is working on him owns several firearms, or those engineers in the oil patch or his child is being taught by a teacher that is a NRA member.  Texas, got love it.
589 2018-07-23 22:40:30 Butttt you still drill for oil. Not impressed
590 2018-07-23 22:40:27 While I can’t possibly get in the head of the idiot currently in the White House, I don’t believe for a second my country has aspirations for Iranian land. Love to see your source for this alleged plot. We don’t need oil & if we did, we probably would’ve stayed in Iraq.
591 2018-07-23 22:40:27 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
592 2018-07-23 22:40:27 Zest into sugar (for sprinkling over fruit!) or peel some rind into olive oil (for your salad dressing)! Don't waste any part of that ! 
593 2018-07-23 22:40:22 でも暦とセットで言われてるだけなような気もする
594 2018-07-23 22:40:19 This lucky girl is spending the day at the spa: hot springs, Moroccan full body Athan oil massage, head massage, hair treatment, one hour facial. How did I land this? I’ll never know
595 2018-07-23 22:40:16 I wanna rub coconut oil on your bald head. #Subtweet
596 2018-07-23 22:40:16 If we could use irony as an energy source, we would never need to mine another nugget of coal, never need to frack another sand field, never need to drill another oil well. This Administration appears to have an infinite Supply.

600 2018-07-23 22:39:57 Do an oil change on the Lexus while at the same time eating Cheetos YOU WONT ps you can’t wipe the Cheeto dust off your hands while you’re doing it
601 2018-07-23 22:39:41 This is why there are so many ill informed Trump supporters out there. These snake oil salesmen who pretend to be on their side are selling easily disproven lies. And MAGAts just hoover them up as fuel for their hatred of HRC. He’s lying to you. Seriously. Just google it.
602 2018-07-23 22:39:33 Run me down with the oil 
603 2018-07-23 22:39:21 The Old and New Testaments have many examples of anointing the sick with oil. And Luke was a physician! Christian (and other religious) monks studied (and still do) herbal remedies. It seems like some Christians are stuck in Puritan times.
604 2018-07-23 22:38:58 わ、おやありでした〜！！
605 2018-07-23 22:38:57 Is this so that Russia gains from Iran’s loss of oil revenue? Praise be.
606 2018-07-23 22:38:47 my dad is so shocked that he loves things cooked in olive oil even though he hates olives. this mans drives me insane
607 2018-07-23 22:38:23 & That Box Be slippery Like trynna walk on Oil 
608 2018-07-23 22:38:22 there is ono global warming / climate change, its now just hotter than **** all over the world:) do something  or get used to it
I think burning more oil will help cool things off, no, wait, wait,,,
609 2018-07-23 22:38:14 Tryna figure out why @lizzo’s Coconut Oil isnt an anthem yet...whole album is 
610 2018-07-23 22:38:03 Nothing stops access if someone is willing to transfer info, clearance/authorized access or not. Difference is in legality of doing so and what is done with it. And how do you know what any of "them" are doing?
611 2018-07-23 22:38:02 He is already setting up Powell to take that rap China trade fight is just getting started oil grains copper meat prices steadily dropping and Powell wants to raise rates! That’s crazy talk
612 2018-07-23 22:37:53 @EPAAWheeler Tearing down excellent regulations is just something Trump has to do to pay back campaign contributors like oil and gas and mining.  He doesn't care if he destroys our National Monuments and Parks.  Our legacy to our children.  Don't appease him!  It is not economics
613 2018-07-23 22:37:51 I always wanted my Olive Oil  "Extra Virgin" 
614 2018-07-23 22:37:44 Oil prices climbed after @realDonaldTrump tweet about Iran 
615 2018-07-23 22:37:33 Yay just got a new oil cartridge of GELATO

617 2018-07-23 22:37:11 Try lavender oil..

618 2018-07-23 22:37:08 Rhino funded by Koch bros..big oil animals..lol
619 2018-07-23 22:37:00 Prospect for oil at the Folger Shakespeare Library.

621 2018-07-23 22:36:51 ねむい
622 2018-07-23 22:36:50 Hubby told me some guy on business channel, CNBC?, all fired up about liberating Iran and bringing oil prices down.
All that proves to me is good Ky bourbon has reached Wall Street by the barrel.

625 2018-07-23 22:36:07 and their oil revenue will pay for it, pardon me while i lick my comb
626 2018-07-23 22:36:06 Big oil is big power   Lots of money for journalists.  Follow the money
627 2018-07-23 22:36:05 When I started respecting tramadol, was when my neighbor was dancing to my generator sound,and sweating profusely, when I put off the gen he ooooo Mr Dj why now,he asked pls who sang that song,i said is petrol featuring engine oil. Johnas comedy Noni.
628 2018-07-23 22:35:59 Yea.. Made in america with chinese crap or just crap... Just bought an "AMERICAN MADE GENERATOR,"  GENERAC... Damn labels falling off out of the box, oil stick behind a panel, that requires you to carry a screwdriver to check oil.. Screws stripping etc..
629 2018-07-23 22:35:52 Is war still advantageous to oil companies? Or, with cheap sun & wind, would higher oil prices only hasten their demise? Should they BE CAUTIOUS?

634 2018-07-23 22:35:14 Yeah because that’s exactly what we need another Middle East conflict this one with nuclear weapons all this death and destruction for one thing oil and trump has already destabilized Iran by going back on the deal we had with them until we no longer need oil there will be war
635 2018-07-23 22:35:13 A fake tomb, all form and no meaning, the tomb which denies death, barrels are empty, empty tombs as fossil fuels are instead dead matter & microrganisms.The barrel pun may make sense in the City but makes little sense in the Serpentine: where is the oil? Where is death?
636 2018-07-23 22:35:00 I have a leading suspicion that the author of that @nytimes article in regards to @exxonmobil and the discovery of oil in Guyana has never actually BEEN to Guyana. His description of my heritage country sounds like an early-settlers log.
637 2018-07-23 22:34:54 #thechase the minus offers are great.
You take this offer because basically your can't be bothered.. Your on the TV, and you just want to veg! Cool man!
You have a complete country out for your blood. You have to change your name go work on a oil rig. Worse than being a murderer
638 2018-07-23 22:34:42 Oil prices are likely to tumble
639 2018-07-23 22:34:37 My man bought me new tires, changed the oil, and cleaned out my car 
640 2018-07-23 22:34:33 @bbc5live Some of us choose to go running in the midday sun, so I'm sure it's possible to work in such weather. I find it far worse in the office being frozen to death by air-con! Wear a hat and sun oil, and drink more water. It's not complicated!
641 2018-07-23 22:34:15 Hope everything is ok!  Try Magical Touch in Williamston for oil changes and Discount Tire in Okemos. Both places are exceptional.
642 2018-07-23 22:34:14 But they are being targeted for indoctrination *because* the East is pissed at the West for bombing them into oblivion for decades in order to control their oil. Pick up a book man.
643 2018-07-23 22:34:09 Don't forget that the CIA overthrew a democratically elected Iran government in 1953 because Iran was selling oil to the wrong customer and installed a  US controlled puppet government led by the Shah of Iran who made Saddam Hussein look like a choir boy.
644 2018-07-23 22:34:05 ...since oil industry arrived in Abdn, locals working offshore get called 'Furrybooters' by colleagues on the rigs who hail from elsewhere in Scotland... because when *we* ask where somebody's from, we tend to say "Far aboot(s) d'ye come fae?" :-D
645 2018-07-23 22:33:20 Because Russian oil industrialists teamed with R Mercer, SCL’s CA and Israeli spies to hack and conduct psyops on US, UK & EU? Putin‘s only role in this so far has been fall guy. That’s beside the point. Dems statistically can’t win, unless they work with democratic socialists.
646 2018-07-23 22:33:18 I think you will find out the truth once Scottish oil revenue is repatriated #DissolvetheUnion #indyref2
647 2018-07-23 22:33:05 Alcohol is pure poison. I understand a glass of red wine now is good for you, but that's it. Cannabis does have derivative benefit with it's oil and if it's the choice to help relives true chronic pain.
648 2018-07-23 22:33:00 Did Brown have the hunger at Hibs? McGinn is a Celtic fan and I’m sure would go up a gear if he moved. Feels like to win 7 in a row at Celtic. Mate I know what that feels like, I’ve felt bigger achievements changing my car oil 
649 2018-07-23 22:32:58 Oil change and power steering fluid check 
650 2018-07-23 22:32:52 真似るだけでは同じ成果は得られないし、先発の価値を落とすこともあるもんね
真似ていいとこと真似ちゃダメなところの見極めはなかなか難しいよね
651 2018-07-23 22:32:45 Who know how to do a oil change?
652 2018-07-23 22:32:31 Sage, rosemary, coriander, salt, pepper, olive oil. Tossed and drained then roasted at 400 for about thirty minutes.
653 2018-07-23 22:32:30 Hey..what 39 billions..didn't you tell us ..Go whistle for it...is it the same bloke who was going to lay in front of a bulldozer...how did we fall for this lot of snake oil salesmen?
654 2018-07-23 22:32:05 both in the airline sector and in industries in general.  Volatility in oil also put price shocks across multiple industries and sectors that year which nailed transportation and really beat airlines.  Those trades themselves just happened to be lucky (or unlucky depending)..
655 2018-07-23 22:32:00 SAUDI ARABIA wants IRAN to stop any and all OIL production and selling
656 2018-07-23 22:31:43 stopped that and called him Rock like in Japan, the narrator saying "200X" instead of "20XX" (at least the text got it right), possibly completely visually re-doing Oil Man, polishing the code for the pendulums..
657 2018-07-23 22:31:39 Spilt sesame oil on myself so I guess that’s all I will smell for the next million years.
658 2018-07-23 22:31:39 I’m sitting in Lithia Ford, waiting for my oil change while eating my skittles and texting my mom for treatments for my possible ear infection. I am the most adult child around.
659 2018-07-23 22:31:15 But actual image of baba ganoush is more like hummus and mine has craters and hills and it's cut like pizza (any round thing I cut like pizza smh) so oil got accumulated in the deep valleys!
660 2018-07-23 22:31:07 Is he the oil rig out there?
661 2018-07-23 22:31:02 I’m gonna teach my kids how to shoot guns without shooting people unless they’re at war, gonna teach them that meat is better than tofu, how to change the oil in their vehicle that uses gas, and to not get their feelings hurt if someone has a different opinion than them.

667 2018-07-23 22:30:16 Now rub him down with punishment oil. Gently and thoroughly 

 Not sure where this is going ...
668 2018-07-23 22:30:08 Tell dem. Pls
669 2018-07-23 22:29:56 If he keeps going after land for drilling oil, he's gonna have to ride his damn horse around in his yard.

671 2018-07-23 22:29:14 my oil paint smells so strong i’ve decided that This is the reason i have 3 brain cells left
672 2018-07-23 22:29:13 A skin oil thing I had in my car spilled in my backseat and my dads gonna be pissssedddd
673 2018-07-23 22:29:05 Yes value of oil comes from the labor requires to extract it
674 2018-07-23 22:28:52 Said the nun to the vicar lol atb
675 2018-07-23 22:28:51 How’s the drinking water in flint or the the ash ponds from the coal mines or perhaps the oil spills on our farmers lands from the pipelines
676 2018-07-23 22:28:12 Hon @EugenieSage said "Unlike Trump’s America, you don’t issue executive orders, we are in a democracy, you do the policy work, you consult other agencies, you consult colleagues, so that you get sound policy" 

How does NZ Govt stack up for banning new offshore oil exploration?!
677 2018-07-23 22:28:06 {‘the breakfast mask’}

• 1 egg yolk
• 1 tbsp of honey
• 1 tbsp of olive oil
• half a cup of oatmeal

1.  combine the egg yolk, the honey, the olive oil and the oatmeal together
2. stir well and apply to your face for 15-20 minutes 
3. rinse with lukewarm water & moisturise!
678 2018-07-23 22:27:51 Well, this isn't correct but hey don't let the truth hinder your hatred.

Trump's Iran tweet today helps Putin how?
Arming Ukraine helps Putin how?
Taking out 200 Russian fighters helps Putin how?
Opening oil pipeline helps Putin how?

Trump  on Putin "I'll be he worst enemy".
679 2018-07-23 22:27:49 Kharg Island is Iran’s only oil export terminal.

It’s very vulnerable to attack. And would economically destroy Iran if disabled.

681 2018-07-23 22:27:35 A bit hypocritical, no?
682 2018-07-23 22:27:27 FEW Americans know we spend as much on Europe's defense as we spend on our own $700 billion While Germany, as @POTUS said is PAYING Russia, FROM WHOM WE ARE PROTECTING THEM billions for oil & gas-other CRITICAL DEFENSE systems which negate NATO's, making other members less secure

685 2018-07-23 22:27:10 does anyone else get a migraine the day after edibles?? or from using the oil pens?? or just me.
686 2018-07-23 22:27:06 That's music to our ears! All that invigorating peppermint oil and scrubby aduki beans, are working their magic! 
687 2018-07-23 22:26:55 Trump isn't owned by Putin. If he was we would reduce military spending. Oil production ect.

707 2018-07-23 22:23:52 Yeah, I got sesame for cooking in the pan at high temps and figured "eh, why bother getting out olive oil for the oven?"

Well, these onions are cooked, but they aren't crispy or browned at all!
708 2018-07-23 22:23:34 We must stop all offshore oil drilling. It endangers our environment and continues our dependency on filthy fuels. Time we move on to renewables.

716 2018-07-23 22:22:37 This tweet needs a link to the product. I have recently used the gear oil for my Tacoma.

721 2018-07-23 22:21:34 That’s why youre only supposed to use(mix) an oil (olive, peanut, avocado, sesame, etc) and balsamic vinaigrette  as a dressing

723 2018-07-23 22:21:29 uhhhhhhhh

oh shit what temp? You're gonna run up against temperature differences, by using different oils. Sesame oil is a highly refined oil with a smoke point around 450F.

Your olive oil was probably unrefined, right? Much lower smoke point. Behaves differently.
724 2018-07-23 22:21:27 Stir frys are another easy way to have a good filling meal. Just use whatever veggies you have lying around! Onions, peppers, carrots, corn, snap peas (or regular peas), sauteed in olive oil with garlic and salt and pepper. Add in rice or ramen/soba/etc and soy sauce to taste.

"Why should ... ?"
they aren't.  stop swallowing the propaganda.
729 2018-07-23 22:21:08 You're not getting it. The fact that he's an OFFICER OF AN OIL COMPANY, and didn't disclose this conflict is unethical, at best, and fraudulent at worst. If anyone needs to be investigated by @SEC_Enforcement, it's Larry Fossi.
730 2018-07-23 22:21:04 Seriously? How can you bear to be associated with crap like this?
Norway has a trillion dollar oil fund because it is independent. We should not aim for that instead we should settle for a space port?
731 2018-07-23 22:21:02 Imma pull the baby oil out on my shawty like in the porno videos cuzzo
732 2018-07-23 22:21:00 I think the fact that my coconut oil has been in liquid form for the past month shows how hot it’s been

741 2018-07-23 22:19:48 I know. The guys at Midas said I needed special oil or whatever
742 2018-07-23 22:19:46 It’s both oil and gas. The question is, what happens with a serious destabilization of the Russian economy? It’s complicated and we could trust someone like Obama or Clinton to understand all the variables and make good decisions. This bozo Trump? No 
743 2018-07-23 22:19:38 I loooooove home-grown tomatoes! Mmm, put those with some basil and mozzarella, season with salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. My mouth is watering.
744 2018-07-23 22:19:36 Saudis have the right to decide anything in their country? HAHAHAHA is that why you starting an increased output of oil because Trump told your king to do so? Stop making yourself look stupid 
745 2018-07-23 22:19:26 Whoa, if you try to put veggies in an oven and use sesame oil instead of olive oil, do they not brown? Because they're not browning.
746 2018-07-23 22:19:25 What would also be better for the Mid East is the day we can tell Saudi Arabia to get lost as we no longer need your oil.
747 2018-07-23 22:19:14 Well that’s when snake oil’s sales man cons you.

750 2018-07-23 22:18:58 Sorry, but no. Larry Fossi chronically failed to disclose his conflict of interest, and it's not unreasonable to assume that he stood to gain from his @MontanaSkeptic1 posts, given his "Manager" position at an oil company.
751 2018-07-23 22:18:58 i got fish oil on my hand and now i have to shower bc my hand is stinky
752 2018-07-23 22:18:54 Are they out of sacramental oil?
753 2018-07-23 22:18:47 lmao omg this car is so horrible  i take to get my oil change and they tell me there are like 10 things wrong with my car 
754 2018-07-23 22:18:42 Don't trust the @Midas touch. Drove off after oil change and tire rotation, but they forgot to tighten the lug nuts. Luckily was still in parking lot when the  wheels started wobbling and almost came off. Hope it didn't screw up my car.
755 2018-07-23 22:18:34 Wayment... from what I saw I thought Dabo had just started baptizing players in vegetable oil.

768 2018-07-23 22:17:26 For anyone that cares the discount on Western Cdn Select oil is ($26.25) this morning.That means we sell it to US refineries approx. $26.25 lower than their domestic WTI supply. They refine it make the money and in some cases make us pay for it when we import it. But no one cares

774 2018-07-23 22:16:18 As for the polution the pipe carries oil down to refineries in the US. The pipeline doesn't polute,the pollution  has to be referring 2 the refineries..That has NOTHING 2 do with pipeline! It'll increase revenue add over 3 million jobs, LOWER gas prices and stimulate economy
775 2018-07-23 22:15:49 I put scented room spray mixed with water in my diffuser and it says only to use essential oil but I wanted to see what happened if I didn’t follow the rules and the thing bubbled up and I probably almost broke it so don’t ever do that if you’re thinkin about it

777 2018-07-23 22:15:44 Fun fact: the Alberta oil sands are actually just a bunch of Super Walmart-sized Tim Hortons and all the photographs you see of the "tar sands" are actually manipulated images of Morder meant to deter non-Canadian tourists

780 2018-07-23 22:15:16 not much. listened to understand when my people spoke to me. yesterday shared some cannabis oil but did not do that today.  wasn't a raging bitch from hell, that's always pretty helpful & i tried not to say or think mean words.  I don't go out in public much, being good is easy.
781 2018-07-23 22:15:13 Look, I get that people are upset about this Montana Skeptic guy deleting his Twitter, but purely from an optics perspective, "guy who runs oil pipelines for a Trump-supporting billionaire" is a terrible choice for a vocal Tesla bear and it's probably good he's gone.

794 2018-07-23 22:13:44 the marinade for the chicken is by Stubbs. It says it’s for pork on the jar. I put dress ginger & lime zest on it. Roasted the sweet potatoes in a little salt, pepper, cinnamon & coconut oil. Spinach sautéed in  juice, red pepper flakes & olive oil.

796 2018-07-23 22:13:30 This would probably be the war that ends all wars. From everything I read Russia will not allow the United States to invade Iran. Unless an economy is highly dependent upon Iran for oil flow. This would be a war of nuclear super powers and would probably bring in NATO and China.
797 2018-07-23 22:13:28 Putin can EASILY be swayed.

A war with Iran would send oil prices through the roof.  Putin would happily sell out Iran in exchange for much higher oil prices.

801 2018-07-23 22:12:39 Add cardamom. It's yummy. I also do brown butter and cook the bananas in it. It caramelizes them. Oh, do you do butter? Or use coconut oil?
802 2018-07-23 22:12:22 Put too much of the valerian root oil I made in one of my batches, which I love, however all of my customers would have definitely noticed the unmistakable smell of feet so I had to redo it 
803 2018-07-23 22:11:58 I think it's like a baby out in the sun - much more prone to sunburn.  As it gets older and more leathery, it can just smear on coconut oil and get out there with a watneys red barrel on the roof, no probs.

807 2018-07-23 22:11:05 The United States has the largest network of energy pipelines in the world, with more than 2.4 million miles of pipe.

That alone will cause a global meltdown
816 2018-07-23 22:09:56 Selective pick of history to justify a deranged man's drums for war. So Iran should be silence in the view of Trump violation JCPOA, installing sanctions, demanding the rest of the world to not buy Iranian Oil, and threatening to put even more sanctions???????
817 2018-07-23 22:09:55 Should have a pipeline. Moving oil by rail is stupid to begin with. Common sense would tell a person not to park a train there. The whole thing was unnecessary.
818 2018-07-23 22:09:41 That song has so much depth. I chose an essential oil for each song and that one was pink peppercorn - it taught me that there are so many layers to the song and so much love.
819 2018-07-23 22:09:36 If this bot is American & know history you would know Iran was a U.S trading partner; before the Saudi Arabia oil link the largest % of imported oil came from Iran ; the Shah of Iran human rights violation of his ppl created the revolution 1979, the U.S. was invested in Iran big!
820 2018-07-23 22:09:27 Follow the oil money.
821 2018-07-23 22:09:26 But in 1998, the price of oil collapsed again, dipping to $10 a barrel. The impact on Venezuela — which, like many oil-rich countries, had never managed to diversify its economy = oil was 1/3 of economy
822 2018-07-23 22:09:25 Was going to stream tonight (Road to Redrix) but might just grind off stream since if I do stream I’d end up staying up till like 4am. Tomorrow I need to wake up and get an oil change on my wife’s car. 

But I’ll make a highlight video on the matches we play.
823 2018-07-23 22:09:20 I had oil change in @SearsAuto Nashua on 7th of July 2018. I felt something wrong and found out that they didn't change my oil, also they forced me to do synthetic oil. send email to Customer care but never heard back #Sears
824 2018-07-23 22:09:04 Hey boo! She used The turmeric mask!! I also recommended the oil serum to fight acne & scars as well, you can use it morning and night.
825 2018-07-23 22:08:43 Venezuela’s mother lode, the Orinoco heavy oil belt, which holds more than a trillion barrels of tarlike bitumen. Unlike regular light crude oil, which can be pumped straight out of the ground and sold as is, heavy oil is more difficult to extract and then needs to be upgraded
826 2018-07-23 22:08:33 Dead right about dirty oil. We produce sweet crude and export it then import low quality stuff & run it through Marsden Point. We should invest in adding value to our own resources
827 2018-07-23 22:08:29 Dinner will be pasta with snap peas, spinach, mint, and shrimp. Simple olive oil and garlic dressing I think.
828 2018-07-23 22:08:27 Follow the money. #Oil
829 2018-07-23 22:08:25 like the new lip scrubs i got taste rlly good. and the face oil i got smells just as good. everything is just good.
830 2018-07-23 22:08:18 Have you tried using CBD oil? Either in edible or smoke form. Great for anxiety... doesn’t get you high.
831 2018-07-23 22:08:13 They'll bounce baby when I'm doing u doggystyle u sexy girl covered in baby oil 
832 2018-07-23 22:08:13 Trump looks like he just have Ivanka away. Putin was so happy he did a little march/dance. So Putin told trump to go into Iran because he wants the oil!
833 2018-07-23 22:08:07 tea tree oil & ice has been working for me (:
834 2018-07-23 22:07:47 Burning the midnight oil!
835 2018-07-23 22:07:42 Mr Finch in Ambridge - could it be his Evil Intelligence Oil that Freddie is selling?  #thearchers #drwho
836 2018-07-23 22:07:37 So it's a word play, a sleight of hand, a confidence trick. Who exactly is expected to buy this snake oil?
837 2018-07-23 22:07:36 Venezuela: combination of plummeting oil revenues and years of government mismanagement has virtually killed off the country’s economy, sparking a humanitarian crisis
838 2018-07-23 22:07:35 We will feast this summer on the blood of the French! With a side order of........French Toast.
839 2018-07-23 22:07:33 Fresh ginger juice (1TBSP) + 1 TBSP water (or honey), taken first thing in the morning on empty stomach. Eucalyptus oil applied topically.

841 2018-07-23 22:06:53 What are you even taking about. A lot of those countries on the map have no oil.  This is a ding map, that makes dumb people feel good, it serves no other purpose.
842 2018-07-23 22:06:51 I thought it was just Dabo baptizing players in vegetable oil...
843 2018-07-23 22:06:29 At least a ‘diya’ (oil lamp) goes off with a bright flicker. #SS will go even without it. On the way out hopefully.
844 2018-07-23 22:06:11 2.) look at a map, can we afford to loose access to the UAE & Saudi Arabia for oil by sea?
Gas cost here would be at an all time high. Walk softly @realDonaldTrump you are NOT AS TOUGH AS YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE.
845 2018-07-23 22:06:11 Al-Basrah Oil Terminal (ABOT), Iraq.
846 2018-07-23 22:06:09 Now do you understand? Why we pleaded why we begged not to vote for Donald Trump. This snake oil salesman is tearing apart our democracy damaging our reputation overseas and laughing all the way to the bank as he charges the American people for his vacations at his own property.
847 2018-07-23 22:05:43 shall do no servile rest of the oil Ministers should follow the morning  #Christianity #Bible #Jesus #HolySpirit #creationism
848 2018-07-23 22:05:37 Broccoli Rabe sautéed with garlic and olive oil is delicious.

852 2018-07-23 22:05:18 It's because those emission regulators hurt the oil industry which is sure many in the US goverment have investments in
853 2018-07-23 22:05:18 The beautiful faces of children is not evidence. I think coconut oil is great btw. But it is shit evidence looking at children ffs.

857 2018-07-23 22:04:49 #CNN Did U Know that @ 40% of EU Nat'l Gas comes fr Russia &  it Also OVER 3,000 B of OIL/per DAY--While the USA "is" the WORLD's "Largest Producer of OIL & Trump Said the USA  would GLADLY--Supply GERMANY & the EU Oil & Nat'l Gas --So... They  Would be "Less" Dependent on Russia
858 2018-07-23 22:04:38 We're being held hostage by the West Texas Crude pricing index. We need our ethical oil to reach other markets rather than the U.S alone. 

These trade tariffs don't help a thing. I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of Saudi oil in our refineries. Canadian oil!


859 2018-07-23 22:04:37 frying onions in olive oil is the galaxy brain way to cook onions
860 2018-07-23 22:04:25 this has reminded me to top up my oil, ty x
861 2018-07-23 22:04:22 I believe this one. Iran is threatening to close a strait that exports 20% of the world's oil... Something Ben forgot to mention in his show today. Again, sloppy reporting.
862 2018-07-23 22:04:21 Come lemme see

866 2018-07-23 22:02:54 I'm part of an essential oils group on FB and it scares me when people ask about oil remedies for serious conditions. Like, if you have a stomach parasite, maybe it's time for some doctor intervention.
867 2018-07-23 22:02:47 USO (US Oil Fund) 13.75 held well. 14.05 pivotal and over 14.45 looks great
868 2018-07-23 22:02:17 If EITHER side USA& IRAN disrupts these oil shipments, whether intentionally or not, the impact on financial markets could be greater than what we witnessed in the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s, when oil prices exploded,
869 2018-07-23 22:02:16 Is it correct get the money for the oil which it pulls out from the flow tests?
870 2018-07-23 22:02:08 コマンドミスさえしなければ成功するので、あとは「ミスるなよ～」という精神論ですわｗ

それが一定の動き統一できたのは嬉しい！
871 2018-07-23 22:01:57 currently jordan is driving from jiffy lube to jiffy lube trying to get the oil changed in my car... and if that ain’t love I don’t know what is
@jordanjstella
872 2018-07-23 22:01:44 Lmao $40 for an oil change thats alot
873 2018-07-23 22:01:35 Trump fought fire with fire. He warned Rouhani to

“NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.”

This is not just rhetoric. The Strait of Hormuz is single largest oil checkpoint
874 2018-07-23 22:01:32 never heard of peppermint essential oil in my entire 19 years of living and its too late to get some
875 2018-07-23 22:01:31 you can have all the tea in the world, idc, where the oil ?
876 2018-07-23 22:01:25 But the PNP cannot stand with BOTH.The people (vast majority)HATE the inept government that has brought them a LIFE OF STARVATION for the first time in the history of the country. Look at the vast oil reserve that it has. How a govt could mismanage that? The PNP has the answer
877 2018-07-23 22:01:20 A question peeps, does palm oil come from the tree or a tree. As advert on tele for garnia hair products vegan products supposedly not tested on animals
878 2018-07-23 22:01:18 But I agree with you, Iran got oil too... so they might have proofs about some weapons of mass destruction
879 2018-07-23 22:01:18 Your above tweet make this seem impossible to implement against big monied forces. Big Tobacco back in the day & now Big Oil, Koch Plutocracy casting political doubt on climate change.
880 2018-07-23 22:01:16 LMAO. Using the same playbook they used for NK. That got us a vague promise while they continue to work on nukes. Trump gave up war games.
What is he going to give Iran? Is Israel going to talk Trump into attacking Iran? What is going to happen to oil prices?
881 2018-07-23 22:01:13 As u fine like Mami water
882 2018-07-23 22:01:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet their ability to be financially self-sufficient.
883 2018-07-23 22:01:05 Given advances in drilling over the last 80 whatever years can we assume that there is still oil to be had from Californian wells? Is the US perhaps quietly sitting on a little store of oil waiting for others to run out?
884 2018-07-23 22:01:02 & #Tuesday. Exciting. Off to get some car oil. Hilarious!
885 2018-07-23 22:01:01 160 for an oil change. Trading in my truck now.

895 2018-07-23 22:00:18 to secure corporate oil interests and contain Soviet influence
896 2018-07-23 22:00:10 ‘Rein in’ implies they are out of control. They are not!

At least not if you want clean air & water, never mind for the human species & others, to survive.

The big donors behind the anti-epa movement, esp oil & coal & Koch bros, just are greedy for that last dime.
897 2018-07-23 22:00:07 I like the theory that the burnt engine oil mentioned before is what the hobos are covered in

900 2018-07-23 21:59:54 U.S. and Them: Operation Ajax - Iran and the CIA coup
As nationalism begins to spread through the region the Iranian call to nationalize its oil resources threatens Britains oil interests in Iran and American oil interests around the world.

905 2018-07-23 21:58:55 Hate frying. I gotta wipe oil off things and I don't like it.  Then I gotta strain oil or figure out how to throw it away. You need a container. It's a pain in the ass
906 2018-07-23 21:58:52 Get sone hair growth oil too .. I use “Wild growth hair oil” it either comes in a white or yellow bottle and it works good

909 2018-07-23 21:57:46 Getting my oil changed and there is a white male with a don’t tread on me pro gun shirt / anti Muslim graphics on the back with a “We the People” arm tat. I feel uncomfortable.

911 2018-07-23 21:57:08 Then in a few years we have depleted resources, a damaged environment, and the enemy you sought to thwart has sold their oil to someone else. That someone else has built up while we've languished in isolationism.  Or we could get off oil and lead the world in green energy.
912 2018-07-23 21:57:05 I don’t save my google history it scares the crap out of me. I go from “local news” to “spare room ideas” to “is coconut oil good for my vagina”

914 2018-07-23 21:56:25 Am in complete accord with your view, dangerous, self absorbed snake oil salesman. Australia will ravaged if Malky is allowed to continue #Auspol
915 2018-07-23 21:56:24 I keep coconut oil in the bathroom and use it for hand creme, make-up removal.... East Indian ladies have used it for centuries & they have gorgeous hair. You won't go bald.
916 2018-07-23 21:56:19 Aa fah..it’s the topic on TL nah
917 2018-07-23 21:56:15 Yup
918 2018-07-23 21:55:51 Damn girl I’m sorry! Idk if you like essential oils but, clary sage is an all natural oil that can help push labor along! Clary sage, myrrh, & lavender. Put some drops in the bathtub & relax & inhale deeply! It should speed up the process :)
919 2018-07-23 21:55:46 Burp up fish oil every day so I know your dedication to a healthier lifestyle is real
920 2018-07-23 21:55:41 Ouchie. The coconut oil and extra loves will definitely help speed the healing. 
921 2018-07-23 21:55:30 Yes we need a pragmatic approach to this issue also I  I don't get how we can use oil but get other countries to take the environmental risk, also we import dirty oil
922 2018-07-23 21:55:29 But when I look at his life now. It’s like. Decent size house. Living with wife & kids. Working on oil fields & shit .. & He don’t look happy.
923 2018-07-23 21:55:27 This is great on so many levels. One: it’s literally the same language used for Iraq 2) Iran did have a democracy, but the west overthrew it for an oppressive military dictatorship that would sell us oil, which was then overthrown by shiite religious fundamentalists
924 2018-07-23 21:55:20 Secondly within hours of Trump announcing US reneging on the agreement Israel attacked what were described as Iranian rocket installations ...in Syria.(Remember Israel granted Genie Energy drilling rights to a large oil reserve they discovered...in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights)
925 2018-07-23 21:55:15 Star Light should have replaced Oil Ocean lol
926 2018-07-23 21:55:04 by definition on the SEC website you're right, however this is part of the oil cartel group who need the shorting to continue, so while production ramps we watch it unfold.  I'm waiting in the uk for my model 3
927 2018-07-23 21:55:03  ka nnete? R189??? they're made of what, fat free oil or what
928 2018-07-23 21:54:59 tbh i use it pretty sparingly and am not sure (i'm also GF so don't have as much of a need for it/use EVOO or avo oil to cook). i do a lot of flax/chia/hemp/almonds/avo for fat. totally understand, unfortunately - tough to balance it all out but for me so far it's felt worth it!
929 2018-07-23 21:54:35 The only thing that actually matters for a Stablecoin is whether or not the Saudis require that Stablecoin as payment for their oil. Nobody understands the World/Universe at a high enough level to see it. But I see it.
930 2018-07-23 21:54:30 Gee, that explains everything.  I thought the Iranians were just sore because our Secretary of State said he was working to destroy their oil industry.
931 2018-07-23 21:54:15 opportunity much as what Bush had to tell Mrs. Bush when he decided for the good of Prescott and not free loading off him for the rest of their lives:  Zapata Oil Engineering Company and yet it is an honest company and one of their employees went to the Stanford Graduate School

936 2018-07-23 21:53:30 I think that this episode was based on the true story of the LADY BE GOOD....a B-24 that disappeared while returning from a bombing mission in Italy. The ship was found in the desert by geologists on an oil expedition, I believe.

938 2018-07-23 21:53:24 my current face moisturiser is an spf 30 one but I always oil out real quick in it, whereas when I use shea butter my face is fine but it’s not protected against the sun
939 2018-07-23 21:53:17 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
940 2018-07-23 21:53:16 Why should Comey, or insert any name, have legitimate access to information developed by an agency that may be investigating them? 
They already know more than Congress as it is about what went on. Why should they be current on what's going on?
941 2018-07-23 21:53:14 As a female when it comes to getting work done on your car the mechanics always try to charge you for extra stuff your car don’t need. Like just give me my oil change and let me go 
942 2018-07-23 21:53:05 Shameer, MitoQ supports mitochondrial membrane function and reduces ROS leakage into the cell. Basis supports NAD and has an antioxidant added. Think of MitoQ as good oil and Basis as good fuel. We think the combination of both would be synergistic for mito health and cell energy
943 2018-07-23 21:52:42 White smoke typically means it’s burning oil not gas, so you’re getting oil internally somewhere. That’s not good, might want to get a second opinion.
944 2018-07-23 21:52:19 Any information on what the underlying reason for Gambia to defend its decision to strip African Petroleum Corporation Limited of oil blocks A1 and A4 in an international arbitration process?
945 2018-07-23 21:52:16 “Is that coconut oil in your beard?” 

Me: *laughs in Jamaican* nah it’s blacc castor oil
946 2018-07-23 21:52:16 It also explains why Republicans from Texas, Oklahoma and other oil producing states like Trump's efforts to make the US more like Russia.  Oil and oligarchy are what unites Republicans and Putin.
947 2018-07-23 21:52:09 WTI Crude Oil -0.6% to 67.82 bbl $USO

948 2018-07-23 21:52:00 He accepted from bribes from a foreign government in exchange for arranging oil deals, then lobbied against investigations into that same governments human rights record. He should be in fucking jail.
949 2018-07-23 21:51:33 I thought coconut is a carrier oil, not an essential oil. If coconut oil isn't light which is? Olive or almond?

I don't use coconut oil, I also stay away from products with the oil as a base too
950 2018-07-23 21:51:20 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
951 2018-07-23 21:51:11 Whole: kosher salt and pepper the outside. Heat oil  to fry it. Keep basting it until crisp on both sides. I serve this with a green tomatillo sauce and the crowd is pleased
952 2018-07-23 21:51:05 It was done because of 3D Sonic Blasts limitations. Also is there wind in the original game of Triple Trouble that pushed Sonic? Somewhat like in Oil Ocean in Sonic 2 when Propellers blowed to push you? If there is, the Wind Shield can prevent Sonic from being pushed.
953 2018-07-23 21:50:55 After a failed JAIL WELL, @APCNigeria-FG is now promising @bukolasaraki OIL WELL. Sen. Saraki needs to be careful of WELL WATER, even BOREHOLE at this point in time. It's dangerous!
954 2018-07-23 21:50:48 Firstly, no one is upset. The very reason we’re as crazy as we are is *because* of our shitty past. We own & acknowledge it. But how, pray tell, are you saying that the Oil have done more than the Leafs the past 2 years despite the Oilers not even making the playoffs last year?
955 2018-07-23 21:50:34 With water, Gnut oil or red oil

959 2018-07-23 21:50:06 Filet: salt/pepper + garlic + olive oil + lime. Sautée in a cast iron skillet OR broil but I don’t recommend the latter unless you know for a fact you not gon let it sit more than 5 mins on each side in the oven.

961 2018-07-23 21:49:47 Virgin Coconut Oil is helping with Alzheimer's.  I'm willing to bet the research will never happen in PIG Pharma America.

969 2018-07-23 21:49:01 HOW COME THE ROSEMARY AND OLIVE OIL TRISCUITS DONT COME IN THE FAMILY SIZE BOX!!!????

971 2018-07-23 21:48:45 If you want to say that Mcdavid is better than any individual player on the Leafs, sure I can probably give you that. Is that what you’re saying? Because earlier you said you’d take Mcdavid team over the Leafs which is just silly considering the Leafs are better than the Oil.
972 2018-07-23 21:48:42 يارب جميعا
973 2018-07-23 21:48:42 What’s the point counting history Madam! Currently Modi is presiding over lynching, demonetization murders, Rafael deal scam, cruel price of oil, large scale job losses, worst exchange rate ever and lot of other gobar and mutra. So change your focus
974 2018-07-23 21:48:29 So we know who nat is banging. Cool.
975 2018-07-23 21:48:25 If the Iranian military dares to blockade the Straits of Hormuz oil route then watch a quick lethal military response
976 2018-07-23 21:48:22 And then 30 minuets of yelling bc I definitely did not check the oil
977 2018-07-23 21:48:07 came to prominence and began attacks on British oil companies operating in his country, calling for expropriation and nationalization of the oil fields.
978 2018-07-23 21:48:03 || definitely overdid it today. But the only thing I did was study and go get my oil changed. How the hell am I going to make it through a 45 hour work week starting on Wednesday if I feel like shit after doing hardly anything?
979 2018-07-23 21:48:01 The 1953 Iranian CIA Coup Détat

Western firms had for decades controlled the region’s oil wealth, whether Arabian-American Oil Company in Saudi Arabia, or the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Iran. But in 1951, a fierce nationalist ruler, Mohammed Mossadegh
980 2018-07-23 21:47:28 Also consider - canola, only good seed oil source of ALA omega 3, was developed in 1990s, hence baseline omega 3 will be higher post-2000.
981 2018-07-23 21:47:23 He’s no different to most modern day chairmen outside of the Oil Billionaires... the days of a Shepherd, Hall, Murray or Tom Cowie who were supporters of the clubs they owned is a thing of the past. Football is run as a business first club second these days
982 2018-07-23 21:47:20 I live in an oil town and they are consistently out of gas at these gas stations here. HOW?!?!
983 2018-07-23 21:46:46 They just order them
984 2018-07-23 21:46:41 I would get Oil allllllllll over my fucking pants and shoes man FUCK
985 2018-07-23 21:46:34 Thirdly, apparently in this mans world, oil rigs are about 2ft from the sea......wonder why they look so low.
986 2018-07-23 21:46:34 He doesn't just big oil, he has also sandwiches and liquor and he cleans your windshield so be nice
987 2018-07-23 21:46:23 Needs to change the oil in the deep fryer
988 2018-07-23 21:46:23 Kinda odd isn’t it... Afghanistan and a few other areas times are off-set 30minutes.  Hmmm ##Markets #oil #QAnon

990 2018-07-23 21:46:15 It takes a Manager who has been successful in Spain and Italy to do away with a player who refused to improve and yet do better with a good replacement. Deschamps was criticized for not taking Martial and Benzema to the @FIFAWorldCup. Sure you know the country that won it.
991 2018-07-23 21:46:01 DID YOU KNOW? Equatorial Guinea became an OPEC member state last year and Republic of the Congo this year. With the addition of these two nations, the oil cartel now has 15 member countries: 7 in Africa, 6 in Asia (all in the Middle East), and 2 in South America.
992 2018-07-23 21:45:59 Beauty Bloggers, I’m looking for a fake tan tanning oil, something that is really hydrating and gives the skin a dewy glow after it’s washed off

993 2018-07-23 21:45:58 anybody got tips to make sure my 20-year-old hooptie is in good condition for a road trip in this heat? 

Tires are good. Her oil is new. I don't know how you can tell issues before a car overheats...that's my main concern for her and I. 
994 2018-07-23 21:45:57 So i asked my Dad if he could take my car to get an oil change while i was out of town and turns out... there was a FUCKING RAT stuck in the axial of my tire 
995 2018-07-23 21:45:48 When I actually take the time & oil my locs they feel so bomb
996 2018-07-23 21:45:42 The Trump/GOP efforts to roll back the endangered species act and their attack on public lands & National Parks so that big oil, gas & mining can swoop in and destroy it. The money trail... and the problem with corporations being able to donate to politicians.
997 2018-07-23 21:45:42 Check your Engine oil this morning.
998 2018-07-23 21:45:27 They can't swim due to their oily bodies? What? If anything, that would help them swim due to the hydrophobic properties of oil 8|
999 2018-07-23 21:45:25 If you can afford a bmw, you can afford the oil change price on it too you broke ass bitch

1001 2018-07-23 21:45:02 Would like an original 'Jimmie' oil on canvas or no? I'm using two canvases incase. Incase you need to mouse over.
1002 2018-07-23 21:44:49 Ultimate grinder. Could teach the oil young kids what it means to be tough and grind out games... especially with how WEAK our 3/4 line was last year
1003 2018-07-23 21:44:40 Some years back,the East and southern part of Nigeria were the most notorious for kidnappings, it was so terrible that inhabitants can't go back home,talk less of strangers and multinationals, now reverse is the Case,Kaduna Ranks num 1 in kidnap notoriety. May Allah contain it.
1004 2018-07-23 21:44:40 We are gonna build a wall and make the Tories pay for it. #Brexit #scotland #indy2 #indyref2 let them sit in their paper castles while we sell whisky and oil.
1005 2018-07-23 21:44:30 I know we are all different but this worked better than bio oil for me. Good luck!
1006 2018-07-23 21:44:20 So my dad’s car broke down, and FX Caprara gave him a temporary rental for free. He drives it every day to Syracuse and it’s now been 3 months and 2 oil changes, and he has yet to have his normal car back 
1007 2018-07-23 21:44:17 We couldn't believe it when it happened & brown oil started gushing out!  Fingers crossed tomorrow will be less eventful 
1008 2018-07-23 21:44:03 I love how most service businesses have HGTV as their “waiting entertainment”. I love watching “Love It or List It” while getting my nails done or getting my oil changed.
1009 2018-07-23 21:44:00 My skin reacts to coconut oil. It dries up badly instead of locking in moisture.
1010 2018-07-23 21:43:53 he has $50K "donations" from both Extraction Oil and Gas and Liberty Oil Field Services and another $10K from Tad Herz; VP and CEO of Four Point Energy. dudes bought off

1013 2018-07-23 21:43:47 When will this CBD oil be able to cure ugliness
1014 2018-07-23 21:43:44 All glory to this herd!
1015 2018-07-23 21:43:38 NOPE You love the tramp that put the tariffs on - You need to deal with it, not put that cost on the backs of your constituents .  Your exchange for year round E-15 is to  give RINS to BIG OIL , it  would destroy independents , make less competition , higher prices.
1016 2018-07-23 21:43:34 Ive heard the same wisdom/truth mantra espoused by cult leaders, snake oil salesman, and cults of personality. Tim is a very likeable guy, which is why it is even more abhorrent.

1024 2018-07-23 21:42:36 @SenatorRisch Please stand up for our national parks: they belong to the people. They are not for sale or lease. We don't want them ruined by oil drilling and lumbering. Thank you.

1026 2018-07-23 21:42:30 When your oil change mechanic says you need $600 worth of brake work, so you take it to a mechanic you trust more and he says you need $1200 of brake work 
1027 2018-07-23 21:42:20 And body lotion according to one dermatologist. She's hell on all creams, lotions but swears by olive oil every night
1028 2018-07-23 21:42:15 POTUS 45 will start a war with Iran in order to go in the oil business with Russia and Putin
1029 2018-07-23 21:42:14 Olive oil may be one of the few substances I have not inadvertently tested a phone in. Congrats.

1031 2018-07-23 21:41:50 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1032 2018-07-23 21:41:49 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1036 2018-07-23 21:41:24 I hate having a crappy car in West Texas because I never know if my cars engine is about to blow up or if the smell is just coming from the oil rigs everywhere.

1038 2018-07-23 21:41:15 My skin is genetically great so I usually just use black soap and a moisturizer. But coconut oil helps my sisters. You can buy raw coconut oil and just use it as a moisturizer too
1039 2018-07-23 21:41:06 i bought prepackaged cauliflower rice, but i heat olive oil in pan, add cauliflower rice with garlic powder, cumin, & sea salt. sauté for 5 mins, add black beans sauté for another 2, then add the red onion and then leave it to simmer for a bit on low while the onion gets soft
1040 2018-07-23 21:41:06 No shock there gas efficient cars oh no, gas and oil make more money this way.......................... Few miles = more fuel
1041 2018-07-23 21:41:02 Scam artist, con man, sideshow barker, huckster, bad used car salesman, snake oil cure all proponent.  That describes Trump's "business experience" to a T.  Don't be fooled again America.  Trump is a fraud.
1042 2018-07-23 21:41:01 Trump by imposing embargo on Iran and Venezuela jacked up oil prices to the level that allows Russia to modernize its military. Great job Mr. Trump!

1045 2018-07-23 21:40:54 From what I witnessed driving along 1 and 101 two weeks ago, CA has a LONG way to go. They're pumping a lot of oil (to say nothing of all those ICE-driven cars and trucks). Here's hoping CA does with oil what NY did with fracking: it's fundamentally wrong, can't be done here.
1046 2018-07-23 21:40:52 My point was...if it wasn’t the discovery of oil....libya is just a story we tell our children
1047 2018-07-23 21:40:41 That crossed my mind, but I was told you don't want the hummingbirds getting oil on their wings.
1048 2018-07-23 21:40:27 The reason we don't know the cost of your oil is because you haven't told us. #TellYourStory #ELEVATE #MasksOff #HealEverything

1051 2018-07-23 21:40:09 I’m obsessed with the oil islands! They’re so crazy. The bell tower is on another level. Oil+religion! Interesting to think about disguises on one hand and then valorized symbols of extraction on the other...
1052 2018-07-23 21:40:05 Try the aiken tea tree oil for my stubborn pimples on forehead&cheeks. Well hope its will work 
1053 2018-07-23 21:40:05 You're gonna do great!! I'm excited for you!! I've been told that if you study with a certain smell like an essential oil and then only wear it when you study and wear it during the test it'll help you remember what you studied. (:

1055 2018-07-23 21:39:48 for real: when the 45th president cries about #CNN being unfair, a member of congress wants to become politician
1056 2018-07-23 21:39:43 I'm slipping, unlike the price of a barrel of crude oil
1057 2018-07-23 21:39:40 Definitely agree abt sensory hits -- lots of research on this, too. Put yr feet in cold water a few times a day. Ice cube across yr wrist. Peel an orange or lemon & really inhale. I keep a mix of essential oils *diluted* in almond oil nearby & roll it directly across my nostrils.
1058 2018-07-23 21:39:39 Squeaky wheel gets the oil, keep going until they do then.

1061 2018-07-23 21:39:29 yes, but Iran is on the Pentagon list of 7 targets in 5 years. and Iran is not using petro-dollar to sell its oil. oh, and apartheid Israel doesn't like Iran.
1062 2018-07-23 21:39:29 Rwanda is a land locked country,no oil,no access to major trade ports,went through genocide but still developing rapidly.Rwanda is second best for doing business in africa,only second to mauritius

Now if u study international politics  you would know the enormous growth.
1063 2018-07-23 21:39:26 You and other Nitwits ran this country to the ground and God will punish all of you!

1067 2018-07-23 21:39:02 we need a couple more refineries in this country. we can produce all the oil we need, and then we could refine it as quickly as we need it.

1071 2018-07-23 21:38:40 And without a drop of oil, a bottle of Scotch whisky or massive potential for green energy.

1073 2018-07-23 21:38:31 As enviro minister why isn't @cathmckenna working to convince BC to allow TransMountain project?  Oil cargo train crashes are no bueno for the environment. ..neither is shipping oil from Saudi Arabia
1074 2018-07-23 21:38:27 You are a corporate-crat who refuses to sign a pledge not to take money from Big Oil.

1081 2018-07-23 21:37:32 I mean, I don’t remember coconut oil liquifying in my cupboard before. Anyone?

1085 2018-07-23 21:37:20 That’s right. Keep up refilling your oil lamps. Keep the light on!
1086 2018-07-23 21:37:17 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SecretaryZinke
So Zinke as you vacationed on the taxpayers $ at out federal parks you WERE looking at which ones to sell off to the oil & lumber boys.   YOU LIED to THE PEOPLE.  Lawsuits on their way so best get a good lawyer
1087 2018-07-23 21:37:04 BMW: Bosch also makes half the car supply side...

Stations very little to do with oil companies, way more to do with retail. Oil companies divesting of them.

So I see it as a continued retail engagement strategy, not hung up on the distribution bit.
1088 2018-07-23 21:36:56 However, I will bake brownies, and eat 'em all myself, as I usually use coconut oil, and nobody else in this house likes coconut oil.  I eat gluten free, mostly Paleo, I don't eat many grains, though, I do love oats, and legumes!

1090 2018-07-23 21:36:43 Oh my gaawwwddd been waiting at Walmart for my oil change to be done for over an hour now.  I was told that it would be less than an hour when I dropped it off.
1091 2018-07-23 21:36:41 But it's true. A lot of shit went down during the 70s and 80s that took us to where we are today. Part of the opposition is complicit too, sadly. Oil was mismanaged with nationalization. And thats where things broke down.
1092 2018-07-23 21:36:38 Make sure to take fish oil of some omega 3 supp.
1093 2018-07-23 21:36:27 Yes, we have seen Trump expelling Russian diplomats, imposed sanctions that is hurting the Russian economy,called out European countries pay for Russian oil, sent military arms to the Ukraine. Yep Putin's puppett, democrats wet dream.
1094 2018-07-23 21:36:20 Initially didn’t get past the bit about a fly in your back door, first thoughts were, wear some knickers and usually, there’s something in the way. Anyhoo, I grew up and carried on reading.

1097 2018-07-23 21:36:13 I Stand with the JCPOA . If @realDonaldTrump wants to block Iranian oil to enter the international market then Iran has every right to block the straight of Hormuz. If trump retaliates he will become the aggressor in the eyes of the world
1098 2018-07-23 21:36:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1099 2018-07-23 21:36:06 Same but you can put vape oil in empty juul pods
1100 2018-07-23 21:36:06 If you really want to dig, check out the connection between the Texas oil reserves and _______. That's the next step....
1101 2018-07-23 21:36:05 I am with @obyezeks on the need to  amend the Constitution to allow for the saving of Excess earnings from Oil and Gas as well as other exhaustable Resources into the Sovereign Wealth Fund rather than share with as is the practice today. Sustainability demands that.
1102 2018-07-23 21:36:04 all I’ll ever need in life is my oil diffuser
1103 2018-07-23 21:35:50 It’s because they’re horny for that sweet sweet oil, so whenever we can pump our own and stick it to the Ay-rabs, that’s an opportunity they can’t pass up. And if it means knocking down a few arches and polluting pristine scenery, well sorry but that’s the American way. 
1104 2018-07-23 21:35:48 #ENERGY:

1105 2018-07-23 21:35:48 Did you know, countries with populations of over 5 million are unable to govern themselves. Seemingly, if you are an oil rich nation and able to lead the world in renewables the chances of being a success are so improbable you might as well not bother #saytheunionists
1106 2018-07-23 21:35:48 Thank God Trump w/drew from Iranian Nuke DealObama pd billions/gave Nuke Deal helping them become 1st Muslim Nuclear Power!Now   Trump has 2them!Trump w/Saudis will sanction & stop Iran'soil flow,as China helped sanction Kim Jong-unTrump knows how to Deal
1107 2018-07-23 21:35:45 I’m Trynna do an oil change and the Weather decides that it doesn’t like me it’s fine.
1108 2018-07-23 21:35:44 911 was orchestrated by the US 
as a reason to go to middle East and take oil. Why would they need to consult previous administration, everything should be documented and available for the new president unless there was corruption involved
1109 2018-07-23 21:35:30 Trying this whole oil pulling thing with organic coconut oil. 
1110 2018-07-23 21:35:27 does democracy freedom the right to say fuck you Mohammad the right to criticise ur so called royal family exist ? Do u respect other religions beliefs female rights ?? Nope just oil money that’s all u got
1111 2018-07-23 21:35:12 If you’re not killing yourself, your kids, or your political opponents, you’re doing it wrong!- cnn
1112 2018-07-23 21:35:12 Scotland, the only country in the world where oil is a bane
1113 2018-07-23 21:34:59 key to the dollar's role does not stem from the fact that oil is denominated in US dollars.  The role of the dollar is made possible by the depth, breadth, and transparency of the US Treasury market, which is where the dollars in reserves are primarily invested.
1114 2018-07-23 21:34:58 @GOP  How much $ do you think the Chump and Zinke are getting for opening up public lands to the oil and gas industry?  How much do you think the Chump and his family are getting through Tariff extortion schemes?  Its all about the 1% vs. the 99 %.  The 99 have been mostly Chumps
1115 2018-07-23 21:34:57 Definitely a reaction , oil over water based or vice versa
1116 2018-07-23 21:34:40 I think it will contain the super food face wash, the pro- collagen cleansing balm, the superfood day cream, and the superfood face oil. Possibly a mask too? Im gonna guess the fruit active rejuvinating mask? So many products they have tho so hard to say but this is my guess
1117 2018-07-23 21:34:35 Almost started an oil fire today yaaaay
1118 2018-07-23 21:34:32 Hell yes. I am awful at remembering the names of them... The one where Edward Woodward was a binman, the one on the oil rig, Civvies, the real House of Cards. So many!
1119 2018-07-23 21:34:25 Whoops! Forgot to share this lake view from a few weekends ago without internet.                                 Lily pads on the lake. 8”x10” oil/palette knife on gessobord 2018 #kaytididriksen #pleinair #painting #stradaeasel #paletteknife
1120 2018-07-23 21:34:23 Yeah buddy. Indica is my friend. Really love the West Coast for dispensaries though. I like a perfect Indica CBD oil 50/50 blend. Everyone should be using CBD oil by the way so many benefits.
1121 2018-07-23 21:34:18 Trump's decisions revolve around oil, or oil profits to be more precise. Where is there huge money to be made in oil? Russia. What hurts oil & gas prices? Too much oil = Iran being able to sell oil on international market = More supply = lower prices.
1122 2018-07-23 21:34:17 Engine oil diet.
1123 2018-07-23 21:34:17 Don’t really get what saying
I’ve done ton research on Trump connections to Putin’s Mob 
He’s dirty
That’s why he’s not saying one

1125 2018-07-23 21:34:04 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming
1126 2018-07-23 21:33:57 You think Putin took over the US so we could clear the Keystone XL pipeline, increase US oil production, secure our border and elections, and reduce unemployment to historic lows?

It seems that Democrats have a very high opinion of Putin. You people are sick!
1127 2018-07-23 21:33:55 @TheJimCornette @GreatBrianLast Watching NWA 88 and came across Ricky Morton teaming with Nikita Koloff after Robert Gibson left. My question is were there any plans for this oil and water pairing before Ricky himself left soon after? #CornyDriveThru

But yea it was the deal of the century. Where is it?
1134 2018-07-23 21:32:49 Are you digging an oil well or just looking for water?

1138 2018-07-23 21:32:10 It’s refrigerate your coconut oil week, part 2.
1139 2018-07-23 21:32:01 Don't forget the nature of that relationship was very one-sided. It was - predictably - very beneficial to the US (oil, military bases, buyer of arms, etc.) and not so beneficial to Iran (similar to the way the US is now cozy with Saudi). They will ditch you before you know it.

1144 2018-07-23 21:31:30 Republicans are willing to contradict states rights principles if it means that their donors will be able to maintain fossil fuel energy dependency in this country. Take a look at 2Q earnings for the oil industry: +141%. For the GOP, oil is the past, the present and the future.
1145 2018-07-23 21:31:26 Smoking weed anymore we call it lighting up big oil.
1146 2018-07-23 21:31:11 I refer you back to my Bretton Woods post.  Yes, commodities are priced in the largest and most freely traded and convertible currency.  With the US the single largest economy and now the largest producer of Oil it is likely to stay that way.  Iran is irrelevant to the US  in oil

1151 2018-07-23 21:30:22 Turns out Labour of the day were only intent on running out the clock until oil started coming online , on the back of the McCrone report.

Thatchers was mibbe part right about Socialist theft , and other peoples money, it was the same oil she had her eyes on too.
1152 2018-07-23 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1153 2018-07-23 21:30:15 Boiled in oil would be my preference.
1154 2018-07-23 21:30:12 Lol. I think a good number of females drive Honda cars. It's not as bad as it sounds. You don't need to become a mechanic, just include it among the routines of car servicing. I don't just change oil, I tell the mechanic to inspect the joints too
1155 2018-07-23 21:30:03 Avocado oil is a healthy alternative to vegetable oils. Avocado oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil, but it is stable at h...
1156 2018-07-23 21:30:00 Unfortunately our addiction to the stuff, blinds us. We are still the people of the oil age.
1157 2018-07-23 21:30:00 Increasing good fats(olive oil,blue fish,nuts and avocado)make you feel satiated so you need less simple carbs and help to reduce bad cholesterol.If you need any tips I don't mind being asked.I made the change19months ago, do analysis periodically and I've never been more healthy
1158 2018-07-23 21:29:47 Only the insurance moguls, the oil company CEOS, and the automobile giants will suffer job loss and revenues...excellent.
1159 2018-07-23 21:29:44 Psalms 109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
Psalms 109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
1160 2018-07-23 21:29:39 Government**

The same people. The same excuses. The same "threats". Same enemies. Same everything. 

Now, no more oil money. They stole everything. They keep stealing. They don't even try to hide it. The country is a drug trafficking hub.
1161 2018-07-23 21:29:33 Sorry Davey,The age of Aquarius is DOA.shouldn't have tried to brainwash the younger generation,and lots more folk aren't buying the snake oil you're trying to peddle.
1162 2018-07-23 21:29:29 How many jobs did the city lost with the oil business downturn? How many families impacted? One reason to be stressed in Houston is job insecurity.
1163 2018-07-23 21:29:28 Phew, good job you didn't specify virgin olive oil
1164 2018-07-23 21:29:13 Baking the nugs raw in coconut oil and turmeric and eating it
1165 2018-07-23 21:29:12 @CarMax  - Bad business CarMax.  Three months after I bought a "Certified CarMax Vehicle", I'm having to cover repairs consisting of 2 oil pan gasket leaks, a bad radiator that has to be replaced because of a leak, and an oil coolant line leak...3 months after purchase!!  #karma
1166 2018-07-23 21:29:02 Use coconut oil, I heard it help gets it out
1167 2018-07-23 21:28:58 Gas burn faster when ya oil need changing too
1168 2018-07-23 21:28:56 @MTP When TRUMP conspired with the WALL ST. TRAITORS to take gas/oil prices up at the CCM and then blame it on OPEC TRUMP was helping RUSSIA while TRUMP hurt his base. Will his base still support him when they're standing in a bread line?
1169 2018-07-23 21:28:44 Coconut Oil also works like a charm
1170 2018-07-23 21:28:37 I try hard to not let things I can’t do anything about stress me. this shit is on the oil companies, not us
1171 2018-07-23 21:28:35 Thanks KILZ brand oil based primer. Started painting my kitchen cabinets and now my cat and I are both probably high 
1172 2018-07-23 21:28:09 you guys misspelled “snake oil salesman”
1173 2018-07-23 21:28:04 This nigga Robert got the oil tho . Smfh .
1174 2018-07-23 21:28:03 Donairs are popular in Alberta, in part, because of all the easterners who came to work here in the oil patch. These guys are going to be bigly busy in conservative Grande Prairie. Yuuge.
1175 2018-07-23 21:28:01 everything by the book.

This country has 20 years in power. It was elected democratically at first (like... 98). And then it was manipulated and shit started going downhill from there.

BUT OH BOY DID IT WORK WONDERS WITH OIL AT 120$+ PER BARREL! Now it worked! Sure it did.
1176 2018-07-23 21:27:53 Just how many accounts do you have @dstaples @DavidStaplesYEG  ++ a couple burners?
1177 2018-07-23 21:27:52 *sitting in line at Valvoline waiting for an oil change* 
mina: “I should’ve brought my word search book”
1178 2018-07-23 21:27:46 what is he going to do, the country who controls the oil control the US
1179 2018-07-23 21:27:41 It’s why Tillerson was brought it & why the WH is crammed w/ Goldman Sachs. It’s why we have been friendly to our foes & berating our friends,got to give people a reason to go along with stealing Iran’s oil when our allies raise a fuss If we don’t get trump out, we will be at war
1180 2018-07-23 21:27:36 Norway only set up their oil fund in 1990. The Tories privatised Enterprise Oil in 1984, the state owned oil exploration company set up up extract Scottish oil from the North Sea. What path would an independent Scotland have taken?
1181 2018-07-23 21:27:33 Wall has been started...why are you low info on that? Also Iran is threatening to be a problem..due to sanctions on them they are threatening to block all oil going thru Persian gulf per video of their leader saying it...you dont know much, do you?
1182 2018-07-23 21:27:16 REMEMBER THE LIE peaking at around 17,000 barrels per day.
Recent surveys indicate Lancaster is linked to the nearby Halifax field and Hurricane estimates there could be one billion barrels of recoverable oil between them.  2014 MR IAN WOOD said
1183 2018-07-23 21:27:09 I know you are on a slightly different tack here, but just wondering--do you take fish oil? And have your vitamin D checked?
1184 2018-07-23 21:27:04 I fixed your tweet: Oh crap, oil is dying... please find more ways to use petroleum-based crap!
1185 2018-07-23 21:27:01 Yes, clearly I do. 

It is our consumption of oil that causes global warming, not the companies’ extraction of it
1186 2018-07-23 21:26:51 Rand Paul calls to revoke John Brennan's security clearance, asks if he's 'monetizing' access:SEND THIS STUPID "KOCH"-SUKKA BACK DOWN TO TEXAS WITH HIS DADA RON PAUL ! HE AIN'T WORTH A PHUK TO ANY "REAL" AMERICAN, JUST LIKE HIS "OIL" OLD MAN !! NOTHIN' BUT PHUK'N THIEVES !!

1190 2018-07-23 21:26:23 Thanks Nancy, Dad did think that’s what it could be. Mum is rubbing coconut oil into my paws like @ChukkaBennett recommended and that’s helping, I’m hardly licking my paws at all now 
1191 2018-07-23 21:26:19 But I Did Change My Oil, Eat, Clean Up Took A Nap & Watched Some Of Shea's YouTube Videos 
1192 2018-07-23 21:26:09 Is coconut oil good for your face?
1193 2018-07-23 21:26:05 Kinda late on a oil change, kinda still too lazy
1194 2018-07-23 21:25:56 REMEMBER THE LIE Hurricane Energy believes nearly 600 million barrels of that could be recovered from the Lancaster field. The figure is around three times higher than estimates made in 2013. The first oil is expected to flow from Lancaster in 2019
1195 2018-07-23 21:25:53 Try applying peppermint oil to it
1196 2018-07-23 21:25:39 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1197 2018-07-23 21:25:22 He's doing Russia's bidding.  Who benefits if Iran can't get their oil out?  Take a guess it starts with an R.......
1198 2018-07-23 21:25:08 REMEMBER THE LIE West Shetland oil field 'contains 2.3 billion barrels' The figure is around three times higher than previous estimates made in 2013. More than 2.3 billion barrels of oil could be contained within a west of Shetland oil field.
1199 2018-07-23 21:25:01 Beard oil and a good brush will do the trick. Brushing helps stimulate blood flow and will in turn stimulate hair growth! 
1200 2018-07-23 21:24:49 My original tweet did RT your Yeg account for that exact reason.

1203 2018-07-23 21:24:25 @TheRyanFelton is so fat that whenever he wears stud shoes, oil is discovered
1204 2018-07-23 21:24:22 get bio oil for scarring
1205 2018-07-23 21:24:22 Liquidity is good tnx to stronger oil price. MinFin flush at moment. Also Putin said state policy is for weaker rubble to stimulate industry. But not too weak to bolster budget revs. They happy where it’s at now at c60

Key is multipolar world = ending $$$ dominance in trade/GIR
1206 2018-07-23 21:24:17 Depends on what leg they proposed & voted for. If they took a mil from Exxon, but voted for sanctions against Russia, voted to end subsidies to oil&gas companies, voted for funding infrastructure for green energy, I'd be happy they kept that mil out of someone else's pocket.
1207 2018-07-23 21:24:07 @Classikool love your olive oil and just brought some and need some more please and have left a review
1208 2018-07-23 21:24:06 Can't wait till it gets back to solid-coconut-oil weather 
1209 2018-07-23 21:23:57 They said oh we will take your car to go get it’s tires rotated and oil changed I come home and it’s not and I have no gas in the other car so I got to put gas in it that’s another 40$
1210 2018-07-23 21:23:53 Fish oil in a milkshake?  Who the hell discovered that would work?  Probably a workplace prank
1211 2018-07-23 21:23:50 Meat works literally have pipes that pump oil into the ocean and y’all still here saying that eating meat is natural

1215 2018-07-23 21:23:02 I know do you think his highness is helping out Vladdie by threatening Iran thusly helping Iranian President with support from patriotic Iranians the president who was getting lots of Criticism from populous  also could increase oil price
1216 2018-07-23 21:23:02 Just like the centuries of rent seeking coal and oil miners Malcolm. Pull your head in mate. #auspol

1220 2018-07-23 21:22:52 Your #TrumpGOP is anti-environment, taking us back decades to please your big oil & gas donors.
Corrupt Colluding Vile #TrumpGOP 
Despicable from top to bottom.
1221 2018-07-23 21:22:42 Ben in his sloppy show today forgot to mention that Iran is threatening to shutdown a strait that exports 20% of the world's oil supply. I think that will be more than enough to go to war over. Keeping your mouth shut is better than acting like you know it all & falling to report
1222 2018-07-23 21:22:36 Yo why can't I go to a dispensary and buy oil without some white dude trying to explain why one is better than the other because of terpenes? Look dude, that's cool and all, but shut the fuck up.
1223 2018-07-23 21:22:31 Spent about $700 on tires, oil change and fuel just today on my work truck. Independent contracting gets expensive sometimes.
1224 2018-07-23 21:22:21 I believe it was a combo of too much oil and too much heat. It was like a deep-fried burger that was raw in the middle. I didn't even serve it, just threw it in the trash and told Simon to order a pizza, haha.
1225 2018-07-23 21:22:15 We've been here for at least 2-3 years. 

Get your head out of the oil well roughneck.
1226 2018-07-23 21:22:11 I'd advise Carter Page, to Stop Going On TV! The dude was an advisor to the Kremlin! He wrote & said this much himself! The reason for the 4 #FISA decisions made by 4 Republican judges! Talking about energy issues = oil = 
1227 2018-07-23 21:22:10 Aka....  Oil spill
1228 2018-07-23 21:22:00 Went to the  car dealership to get an  oil CHANGE,,, the  mechanic asked me when was the last time that i rotated my  tires???? I told him that i ROTATE THE TIRES  EVERY TIME I  LEAVE  MY  DRIVEWAY.....
1229 2018-07-23 21:21:58 In case you haven't noticed @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP, your self-described #StableGenius is teetering & may have blown a head gasket. It's clear you want to ride this vehicle past November & as the driver who won't stop you're forcing all passengers to worry about the oil leak.
1230 2018-07-23 21:21:23 It was  Chili oil that used a wrench to break the chair
1231 2018-07-23 21:21:19 I'm like the dad on My Big Fat Greek Wedding who always says to put windex on everything...except with Lavender essential oil.  It works for everything!!! #essentialoils #lavender #alternativemedicine #naturalhealth
1232 2018-07-23 21:21:08 Africa is not Kenya, Kenya is not Africa!

Africa - Continent
Kenya - Country

Kenya's poverty level - 42%, get your FACTS right.

We might be POOR, human rights abuses, but at least we haven't invaded a Country to STEAL its OIL!

Your Country is now eyeing Kenya's oil. THUGS!!
1233 2018-07-23 21:20:56 You're wearing a white cloth,remember not to follow those with palm oil.
1234 2018-07-23 21:20:44 I really need to put things away after cooking cos I nearly poured myself a glass of olive oil  oops!
1235 2018-07-23 21:20:27 Guessing Putin told you to help drive up oil prices again
1236 2018-07-23 21:20:26 Nothing personal but I'm not really caring about convenience or level of difficulty one experiences in performance of their job. Being out of gov, off radar might make it easier to misuse information
1237 2018-07-23 21:20:25 Oh yes please 
Creed Aventus Perfume Oil is available for 4500 for 20ml + free 5ml and 13500 for 60ml + 3 free 5ml.
1238 2018-07-23 21:20:23 Have not read one single “pro” Tesla article by ZH. Stakes are very high for OIL, AUTO Dealers and Auto Makers. Their interest is to make it fail, and in every comment ZH takes no time to compromise or devalue any effort or success by $TSLA.
1239 2018-07-23 21:20:18 New tires, alignment, and and oil change is freaking expensive but my car drives soooooo smooth now 
1240 2018-07-23 21:20:18 Brian. I will spray them all with oil and set them alight.....two burning peddling breasts!
1241 2018-07-23 21:20:09 About to fry some wings in my new air fryer...... I'll be eating a lot of wings now that I don't have to involve oil or bake them for 10,000 years coated in a baking soda concoction
1242 2018-07-23 21:20:04 Just saw a 96 year old who started medical cannabis (CBD oil) and went from taking 28 pills a day to 5 pills per day and got rid of her walker!

1243 2018-07-23 21:19:47 Churchill coined the phrase 'Policeman of the World' in the 1930s. The USA does not need to always be that policeman or UN enforcer.

1251 2018-07-23 21:18:55 He punched his chest softly. "Shut up now. I really just want to massage you. The happy end will come later." Dean laughed out and grabbed the oils. He straddled Sam and rubbed the oil into his hands. "Okay close your eyes and enjoy it."

1253 2018-07-23 21:18:55 Fellas we gotta do a better job wit hygiene man

We gotta floss 

Clean them dam fingernails

Clip them fingernails and toe nails  AND CLEAN UP THE REMAIns   

And we gotta use lotion or coconut oil whatever can’t be ashy no more G we gotta do better 


1254 2018-07-23 21:18:41 On le voit par exemple avec le fameux "peak oil" qui est sans arrêt repoussé.
1255 2018-07-23 21:18:21 hopping on this train to say tiger balm and emu oil (in small treatments, 6 weeks at a time) have been really helpful in topically treating inflammation w/o breaking the bank

(cbd cream is god tier tho)
1256 2018-07-23 21:18:21 Cantu is helping with longer definition and mane choice growth oil has been going strong a year in... but humidity is just rude.
1257 2018-07-23 21:18:18 Off shore drilling poses a hazard to Florida’s tourism industry, which I’d bet will always bring in more income that oil.
1258 2018-07-23 21:18:06 The Brown Recluses have taken over Uhlan. The bathroom and laundry room have been overwhelmed. The porch can’t hold much longer. Peppermint Essential Oil is running dangerously low. Please help, please!
1259 2018-07-23 21:18:03 Israel wasn't created to give a 'homeland for the Jewish people'. Israel was permitted to cause a canker on the Middle East that would endlessly fester & do exactly what it does: disrupt the Arab nations from consolidating & developing with the opportunity oil wealth could allow.

1262 2018-07-23 21:17:35 Just olive oil? Or some kind of brand? I’m currently using nivea creme but imo its not doing much
1263 2018-07-23 21:17:16 She knows that the uh... the plastic isn’t gonna turn back to oil just because she didn’t use it right? Like she still payed for it and it’s still gonna go to the same place it would’ve if she took it home and recycled it.
1264 2018-07-23 21:17:15 Indeed. George is a man of extreme tastes, hints of MG he can do bright yellow or oil slick blue.
1265 2018-07-23 21:17:05 Thinking about how kramers plan to stop oil spills is to put a giant baloon below the tankers to catch the oil
1266 2018-07-23 21:16:40 Tape it up it will be fine, it’s only the oil pissing out and the machine not turning on.
1267 2018-07-23 21:16:17 Thai peanut sauce: peanut butter, honey, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, salt, maybe some ginger, blend that thang up, throw in some cute cilantro, blend it a little more
1268 2018-07-23 21:16:13 Haitians, in particular, Barack Obama, Oprah, Taraji; they need their share of oil!!  "Blacks"...Now, I get it.
1269 2018-07-23 21:16:10 Try a tablespoon of Black Seed Oil before bed!
1270 2018-07-23 21:16:02 Sell it!! Mine will be here soon and I can’t wait to try it. Her garden beauty oil is a life saver
1271 2018-07-23 21:16:02 The first time I tried that thc oil pen, I talked so much shit saying it wasn’t hitting! LMFAO yeah right!! It crept up on me, couldn’t stop laughing 
1272 2018-07-23 21:15:44 olive oil really helps fading them!! but i think it’s beautiful and normal to have strech marks, literally haven’t met anyone who doesn’t have it.

3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
1274 2018-07-23 21:15:29 Reducing inflammation...... that's the key.

I'm researching the coconut oil! 
That may be the trick I've been needing. 
I use to get upset, now I've just convinced myself that I'll look ok bald!
1275 2018-07-23 21:15:21 Does it have something to do with reducing oil competition for Russia? 
1276 2018-07-23 21:15:20 Why do we need to protest for better roads when. 1, we have the asphalt. 2, we sell oil. 3, we pay taxes. 4, the police is being used as collectors (issuing tickets) instead of fighting crime..  Where is this money going?..  Is it possible to use some of the money in repairs?
1277 2018-07-23 21:15:08 Consider using lower Omega 6 and higher Omega 3 forms such as Grass-fed Butter, walnut butter and avocado oil or chia oil. Omega 3 is anti-inflammatory.

1279 2018-07-23 21:14:58 Nope. Clean energy is the future. Not oil spills and explosions and water contamination.
1280 2018-07-23 21:14:55 The Europeans rely on countries like Iran & Russia for their energy. That's why they r gutless twirps when it comes to getting tough on this rouge regime. I would go as far as to say they don't even care if Iran gets nukes as long as they keep pumping oil. Disgraceful. #TheFive
1281 2018-07-23 21:14:52 Read the article, silly! It’s about baking CAKES. I don’t know many cake recipes (vegan or otherwise) that use tofu or kale! We mostly just replace eggs with flaxseed or aquafaba, butter with margarine or veg oil, and dairy milk with nut/oat/soya milk. It’s not rocket science ;)

1284 2018-07-23 21:14:36 No!!  It's not just the oil!!  No way!  Do you know how much oil is in reserve??  I don't want anymore oil extracted.  Planets blood!!  It's the money...!!
1285 2018-07-23 21:14:34 Following your analogy..what if Ford merged w Standard Oil? Everyone would have to buy from Standard-Ford..similar economics

1287 2018-07-23 21:14:21 I am a big proponent of

free range ( Alaskan Salmon Oil )

B complex vitamins ( lot of b-12s don't cut it, if it doesn't change pee color it likely isn't being absorbed heavily)

Turmeric

un cooked Broccoli (cooked still ok but not as potent) 

Vitamin D 

just to name a few.

     China cutting oil from Iran...
      switched to Saudi Arabia...
    
     I guess....
1289 2018-07-23 21:14:05 Part of what Putin wanted when he favored anybody-but-Clinton was Exxon/Mobil expertise and equiipment in a joint venture taking oil out of Russian Arctic. Thus Tillerson.
1290 2018-07-23 21:13:58 same. And then the Norway movie. Oil rig n' all. #AlwaysNorway #AlwaysAdventure
1291 2018-07-23 21:13:36 Not unless the dollar continues to be strong. If the dollar falls towards 90, oil should come down.
1292 2018-07-23 21:13:31 My husband grills it with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

We also like to mix with cherry tomatoes, purple onions, and mushrooms, marinate in vinaigrette, and grill in a grill basket. Mmmm
1293 2018-07-23 21:13:26 The others wanted cheap oil. Truthfully, if Obama & the Euros kept the pressure on Iran, they would have folded sooner. It was dumb to manufacture a phony deal. It was really a bribe. Screw the Mullahs. #TheFive
1294 2018-07-23 21:13:25 Saw a lady rolling herself in olive oil at the beach; when I came back a couple hours later she was crisp
1295 2018-07-23 21:13:08 my dad was making eggs and the oil in the pan kept popping at him so he flipped off the egg and a chunk of egg popped at his face lmao
1296 2018-07-23 21:12:53 You must put baby oil on yo legs. I can tell.
1297 2018-07-23 21:12:44 You'd never be allowed in Planet Fitness!  That picture alone makes me feel insecure about myself.
1298 2018-07-23 21:12:42 the nuttiest thing i’ve ever heard is that traffic lights were invented by oil companies, so you’d have to stall and waste gas
1299 2018-07-23 21:12:40 The Russians only have oil. If we subsidized EU oil (sold oil to EU at lower price than they get it from Russia) we could bankrupt Russia in a year. As it is the ruble has crashed. That’s a patriotic response.

1303 2018-07-23 21:12:27 Peppermint oil on your temples works like a charm for me!
1304 2018-07-23 21:12:15 In Texas we know full well what it is like when Obama went after the oil and gas industry.
1305 2018-07-23 21:12:14 If I were to review the human species I would say that it’s occasionally intelligent at best.  Fresh water and oil are almost gone and too many people are obsessed with empty garbage. I may need a nap.

1307 2018-07-23 21:11:49 thank you! i think a lot of the confusion is that folks think 'oil' and then well, all oil becomes oil, not distinguishing between mineral/natural.  if i find the thing i read about pesticide & mucus membrane i'll send it over. (google fu failing currently, thus asking twitter)

1309 2018-07-23 21:11:41 I've struggled with this too. I use coconut oil on scalp when I'm not going anywhere and shampoo (without parabens) rarely -using baking soda instead. Reducing inflammation & clean diet is the only common fix I've found for auto-immune.
1310 2018-07-23 21:11:35 I think  the real issue here is the oil being discovered in  and “type of people” that’s gonna benefit from it
1311 2018-07-23 21:11:21 And shame on @JeffBezos @amazon for providing a storefront for InfoWars to fleece customers with their snake oil “health products” and roll the proceeds right back into more toxic garbage videos like this.  Does no one in tech have any conscience at all??
1312 2018-07-23 21:11:18 Ginger, chia seeds, flax seed oil?
1313 2018-07-23 21:11:09 Seems that you are at odds with most of the World's scientists, all of the World's scientific institutions and even the oil companies so, if it's all the same to you, I'll believe them over a lunatic, any day.

1317 2018-07-23 21:10:42 .@FRinMalaysia Ambassador confirms upcoming EU criteria targets palm oil, contrary to its commitment to non-discrimination. Will the French Gov. support the EU & undo its promise to Malaysian smallholders or will they stand by their promise of equal treatment toward Palm Oil?
1318 2018-07-23 21:10:41 Trick question: the gov’t really shouldn’t be using policy to favour any specific industry, including oil & gas. 
I can understand little things to help some smallish industries grow, but gov’t is not historically great at picking winning industries.

1328 2018-07-23 21:09:57 I had iron work one, silver ones, gold one, ones made of tin, and ones made of oil. They all held some sort of grocery berry juice once. It was a ritual like any other.
1329 2018-07-23 21:09:54 Bizarre footage of 1976 heatwave on News at Ten. Everyone queuing at standpipes wearing coats and jumpers. Mainly old people to be fair.

1330 2018-07-23 21:09:43 have u tried lavender essential oil
1331 2018-07-23 21:09:38 I don't think most of the oil places like to replace air filters, because they can easily service people with quicker oil changes and get more customers. Some part stores will offer free installation for simple things like that, but I'm not 100% sure.

1334 2018-07-23 21:09:24 Not much research has been done with colloidal silver being used on animals. That's why we don't recommend it. But yes, it works well most of the time from what we know through random experiences. We however believe that pure coconut oil is safer and quite helpful.
1335 2018-07-23 21:09:23 From Irma lessons, would benice to see the county and the state has oil reserve, water reserve, toalet paper reserve, food reserve! last year it was a  nightmare!
1336 2018-07-23 21:09:20 It's not just for him but big oil pushing up gas prices. We all know that he is about the environment, that is destroying it.
1337 2018-07-23 21:09:14 Halve it and scoop out the “guts”, drizzle with olive oil, salt & pepper, stuff it with a mix of cooked ground turkey, feta, halved grape or cherry tomatoes and brown rice all mixed together and bake. SO yummy!
1338 2018-07-23 21:09:02 Addendum; oil up as much as you want, but not without mentioning the caveats.

1341 2018-07-23 21:08:46 The ONLY source is a study of mineral oil. No one has studied natural oils in the vagina. Many doctors say it's fine, many don't. Even split. So many people who actually use coconut oil (myself inc) commented on my post about coconut oil (lube post or w silicone post) who love it
1342 2018-07-23 21:08:42 Or Mutton Chop Oil

1349 2018-07-23 21:07:50 My 2 c. today: BTC matchs a lot the need of low prices as the "less competitive" amateur miners are left out from the competition. This can be compared w/ the oil market, where the most harming and less sustainable practices are economically feasible only whether the oil is high
1350 2018-07-23 21:07:42 car started smoking & leaking oil so i freaked out & parked my car immediately in front of some business. dude comes out yelling like my car isnt fucking smoking right in front of him like i dont need help or anything. left a shitty ass review on his business' website. asshole.
1351 2018-07-23 21:07:34 Its actually 73%
1352 2018-07-23 21:07:26 Love to see anyone in "power" tear up when recounting the massive damage to the ecosystem and the health of the planet due to the states addiction to oil revenue. #NoDAPL
1353 2018-07-23 21:07:17 The pipeline will create lots of jobs in the oil and manufacturing sectors but the added bonus is that it will also add more jobs in both law enforcement but as well more prison guards when we start to arrest and throw the protestors in jail.
1354 2018-07-23 21:07:11 @elonmusk Please build us an energy grid so we have no reason to go to war with oil producing country.  *sigh*
1355 2018-07-23 21:07:00 greedy oil industry whores at that trump wants to help Putin get that 1/2 trillion in oil it's all about what putin can do for trump.
1356 2018-07-23 21:06:59 Gina Gina bo bina, look at you with all your leg work.  I too had not the greatest results from cbd oil but I know members of my family who have great success from it.  But mine is my body and not the supplier.
1357 2018-07-23 21:06:56 Coffee grounds, Sugar, and Baking soda serve as good exfoliants. 
Honey + sugar + cinnamon make a good scribe (that also provides good antioxidants to your skin)
Baking soda + coconut oil leaves the skin moisturised and clean
1358 2018-07-23 21:06:55 i just used tea tree oil all over my fucking face yall PLEASE send prayers
1359 2018-07-23 21:06:45 @MaryBrowns do you use peanut oil for any products you sell?
1360 2018-07-23 21:06:42 A whole oil producing giant like this, and we don’t even have basic infrastructure... lol Nigeria is a big joke and the world sees how useless and incompetent our leaders are! In every sector/industry, best believe the Nigerian state is getting the shorter end of the deal!
1361 2018-07-23 21:06:37 so Senator Sanders, you will really stand up against Saudi Arabia despite your country's interest in maintaining the oil trade monopoly as it is now?
1362 2018-07-23 21:06:25 For you see, in a healthy relationship, two people must have absolutely nothing in common and hate each other.

According to a snake oil salesman.
1363 2018-07-23 21:06:21  contact @AdaoraBlessing1 for your bear bear oil. It works wonders
1364 2018-07-23 21:06:20 The surplus will be followed by collapse as those farmers lose and have to sell or go bankrupt. Like oil, agriculture will end up in the hands of even fewer corporations without even the pretense of being "family" owned & next year, you had better have your own source of food.
1365 2018-07-23 21:06:07 How do you get In trouble for wearing natural smells and lotions like tea tree oil.?
1366 2018-07-23 21:06:05 #OOTT #Oil 
The price action of #WTI today is a typical roller coaster ride. This is the exact reason why swing trading is not applicable to #US Oil market. The scenario of gaining 100+ pt then losing 150+ pt in next few hours is absolutely not helpful to anyone's account at all.
1367 2018-07-23 21:05:49 if Lee Alexy didn’t take 25 years to do an oil change i would have my car still lmao
1368 2018-07-23 21:05:47 You’re definitely getting ripped off  if you’ve already gone synthetic there’s not much to do about the oil change price but double?? Somethings off.
1369 2018-07-23 21:05:42 Thanks for the tips. I would have polished off the bloom with a drop of veg oil so glad you pointed that out.
Same size, bit of stalk, paper plate. Gotcha. Wish me luck.
1370 2018-07-23 21:05:42 You miss the part where Iran is talking of blocking all oil supplies if dont use theirs> or do not pull the lions tail? Iran threatened us with the oil, and basically said if dont use theirs..wont be able to use anyones. Go get your horse and buggy
1371 2018-07-23 21:05:36 SpaceX is far worse environmentally than the minor oil investment you highlight. By your standard, Musk has a bigger conflict of interest than these guys and needs to disclose his SpaceX specifics. You are sighting one small investment as some sort of conspiracy, disgusting.
1372 2018-07-23 21:05:30 Oil Prices Unfazed by Trump Warning Shot- Charts Highlight July Range
1373 2018-07-23 21:05:22 The Endangered Species Act, which for 45 years has safeguarded fragile wildlife while blocking ranching, logging and oil drilling on protected habitats, is coming under attack from lawmakers, the White House and industry on a scale not seen in decades,   FUCK YOU TRUMP.
1374 2018-07-23 21:05:15 Maybe it’s the oil. Have you tried the baked ones?
1375 2018-07-23 21:05:10 Dorset oil shales and drill Cambrian oil Thatcher Gas the rest is all Scot levy and maybe a little Norwegian Storegga edge if they can find out how to do it Vorderman
1376 2018-07-23 21:05:03 Natatakot ako magtry oil painting  hahahaha
1377 2018-07-23 21:05:02 I can’t put it down to anything else which makes five guys’ burgers taste so good other than it being the fact they use Peanut oil
1378 2018-07-23 21:05:00 $40 for an oil change, or $40 for a super fancy mirror for my room. The choice is obvious people.
1379 2018-07-23 21:04:57 Did you read your white paper before it was published?  If you did, you have a nerve criticising anyone of lying. That document was full of untruths and my childrens' careers are at stake. Salmond knew precisely what was happening with oil yet he included massive income therefrom
1380 2018-07-23 21:04:53 Dad was a jeweller who always taught at the local polytech’s August Craft School, so I got to join in classes. Over the years I did pottery, oil painting, bronze casting, leather work, bone carving...in between running wild with a pack of artists’ offspring.
1381 2018-07-23 21:04:47 Shea moisture rlly out here selling coconut oil as a facial serum... uhh
1382 2018-07-23 21:04:46 Not to worry we will use cooking oil and royco to cook Zanu pf, whilst watching ZBC.
1383 2018-07-23 21:04:46 Great gathering indeed, may the Lord continue to oil your head with fresh anointing for greater things ahead.
1384 2018-07-23 21:04:35 Check out WHY America turned that prosperous country into an “asswipe”.   The nations leader was preparing to issue gold coins to replace the dollar and he wanted to sell his oil for gold.
1385 2018-07-23 21:04:33 Summer said she got an email for cbd oil and I thought she said Canada Soil and was so confused why someone would buy soil from Canada
1386 2018-07-23 21:04:32 Paid £20 for a tanning oil and don’t even think it’s going to arrive on time and is non returnable 
1387 2018-07-23 21:04:15 The fashionistas carrying all body with no head using all cosmetics made of Animal fats. Animal glands. Taking supplements for glowing skin made of fish oil. Skin care used of snake poison. Extremely eating human adrenaline gland.
1388 2018-07-23 21:04:14 Ayyy I was about to pay my oil change and my general manager waived it off free service for the kid 
1389 2018-07-23 21:04:14 So she should probably not have an abortion. What’s a real ‘sin’ is any woman calling herself Trump Girl.
1390 2018-07-23 21:04:05 aka essential oil peddler
1391 2018-07-23 21:04:04 “What did you do/eat/drink to cause it?” (Because this is my fault?)
Or another fav:
“My mom/dad/sis/neighbor tried magnesium/lavender oil/excederine/avoiding meat etc, & is cured” (I have done/am doing literally dozens of therapies, & there’s NO cure) 
BUT people do mean well 
1392 2018-07-23 21:03:58 He also threatened to block all oil going thru if it isnt Irans oil
1393 2018-07-23 21:03:52 Last comment. Do a little reading on British colonialism. The world isn't black and white when it suits. Lastly, listen to Midnight Oil. This is about the abuse and displacement of an indigenous people in their own land.  Reductio ad absurdum will not suffice
1394 2018-07-23 21:03:51 Aaron’s oil pen is everything
1395 2018-07-23 21:03:33 Why did Tony Blair Environmental send me the document Offshore Dorset Australian To save England Wales and Scotland Anyway now you can pay 25 per cent VAT on all the Scot Oil Offshore and sign lots of Europe Social Chapter or go bust as we saved your Butte Mesa US and UK Geology
1396 2018-07-23 21:03:02 Wait, what? Wasn't POTUS responding to an Iranian threat? And didn't Crude Oil prices decline today? Again, much to do about nothing. This is why many Americans are tuning out of Media/Press.
1397 2018-07-23 21:02:59 but ‘spinning the IR’ is saying he is selling a bullshit story! 

Suggestion for next iteration: greasing, wheels, snake oil :-)

This will be a legendary debate!
1398 2018-07-23 21:02:55 A man with dirty hands that smell like oil is so damn attractive & idk why 
1399 2018-07-23 21:02:52 I love the barter system. My co-worker traded me 3 Adderall to hit my oil pen
1400 2018-07-23 21:02:07 Pretty amazing.  Would not have guessed that for chevron given the cyclical nature of oil
1401 2018-07-23 21:01:59 Yep, because redistributing (other people's) wealth feels good!
And to think many Americans hold onto this fantasy that becomes a Venezuelan nightmare.
Don't try to compare with the Scandinavian models. They are rich with oil money.
1402 2018-07-23 21:01:51 i’m at the post office and i just remembered i still have castor oil in my eyebrows so now they’re super shiny lol
1403 2018-07-23 21:01:24 Aphekwe nge annointing oil?
1404 2018-07-23 21:01:21 The only hair products I absolutely need is conditioner, glycerin, argan oil gel, and styling mousse
1405 2018-07-23 21:01:20 always remember the three r’s 

R-esponsibility for climate change lies on corporations
R-esources to support the world’s population are not at a shortage, the way we distribute them simply makes it seem so
R-enewable resources are lobbied against by Big Oil

1408 2018-07-23 21:00:52 Roger is correct.  Advances in medical technology such as vaccines have contributed tremendously to life expectancy via reduced child mortality.

Those are things we should strive to keep even as oil depletes and climate destabilizes.  They benefit quality of life very much.
1409 2018-07-23 21:00:46 We know it exists, but also know it's a small economy entirely dependent on oil and gas prices and access to markets, with high unemployment, low to no growth, rampant oligarchical grafting...and gets pummeled in armed conflict with NATO - Facebook or no FB.
1410 2018-07-23 21:00:41 Any ting with red oil inside 
1411 2018-07-23 21:00:30 My dad said he same thing yest. I’m not talking about that, I’m saying when I place people in a position and they need a clearance it’s usually easier for me if they already have one. It’s a pain in the butt, you have no idea how many placements we lose bc of those clearances.

1414 2018-07-23 21:00:07 July 23, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1415 2018-07-23 20:59:50 And oil isn’t an excuse because it’s price is back to $70
1416 2018-07-23 20:59:45 US Sinking a Saudi Oil Tanker [blaming on Iran] would get everyone's attention.
1417 2018-07-23 20:59:43 Senate democrats won't even meet with him.
1418 2018-07-23 20:59:22 i don't even think i can get cbd oil here rip the dream i got some heat pads and i've got voltaren to take for the week
1419 2018-07-23 20:59:17 So if you need something, you can just take it and exploit the national resource of another nation? We don't do that with our gas, the middle east don't do that with our oil. Not saying it shouldn't be moved from Wales but Wales should be recompensed rather than fat cat profit
1420 2018-07-23 20:59:02 As far as I am aware (with relevant profession expertise), coconut oil, olive oil, and jojoba oil are safe for general use for that sort of thing. (not with condoms though). Is there some reason you think otherwise?
1421 2018-07-23 20:58:58 Iran been involved in a land war with us for the last 30 years. We've sucked oil out of Iran, we've overturned Iranian governments.  We have a conflict with Iran. We need to seem strong to Iran.We are NOT at war with Russia, we are not in conflict with Russia. They might have
1422 2018-07-23 20:58:31 This baby boomer runs his smallholding on renewables taking nothing from the grid, he foregoes his vehicle for 9 months of the year, eats no palm oil, and has reduced his food miles to the bare minimum, also has never flown nor ever will and makes no frivolous journeys. You?
1423 2018-07-23 20:58:21 You honestly think we had a better Nigeria in 16 years of PDP? where's the light? How many trillions were mismanaged in the oil boom? Do we have a refinery as oil producers? What major thing do we manufacture here even toothpick we import
1424 2018-07-23 20:57:58 The private British Virgin Islands company Patagonia 
had agreements to acquire 39% interest in the Llancanelo Exploitation asset.
Pentanova also negotiated a farm in on a further 11% of Llancanelo (US$500,000) deposit. This means 50% of Argentina Heavy Oil in Llancanelo in 1 bet
1425 2018-07-23 20:57:50 Let’s just say when I’m tired not only am I in a bad mood but also i make careless mistakes. Needless to say I managed to get hot oil all over the floor today
1426 2018-07-23 20:57:45 The destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the jungles in Malaysia for Palm Oil plantations are also upsetting the planet's ability to cope.  Add that to the clearcutting in North America.  Thats a whole lot of trees!
1427 2018-07-23 20:57:30 1909..many big events happened.. In a list of 100..10 big ones like,1st opium ban in USA, federal tax, reaching both S&N pole.. Some majore events about Oil, selling land for oil riilggs..

1429 2018-07-23 20:57:13 Hard to respect an individual who goes on ctv and says she doesn't care what people with differing opinions say,  or that men working in the oil and gas industry are all sexual predators. Zero knowledge regarding the science, even thought C02 was pollution.
1430 2018-07-23 20:57:06 I don't know about "all", but Samuel Gompers was open about doing for (with) labor what Morgan had done with steel and Rockefeller had done with oil.
1431 2018-07-23 20:56:53 Working on behalf of protected class perfect cover.  Al Sharpton for one turned it into a career.
1432 2018-07-23 20:56:48 at what point do people chose between clean water and cheap oil? Or, how are these oil spills spoiling water supplies, esp in areas where they are experiencing water problems?
1433 2018-07-23 20:56:44 decided to use peppermint oil for migraine relief and ended up accidentally DOUSING MY SCALP. eyes are burning, head is cold, and boss asked why i smell like a candy cane when i walked in. happy monday!

1438 2018-07-23 20:56:23 Reasons why we will not believe you: Intervention to overthrow Mossadeq Government; Taking and even supporting chemical attacks of Sadam against Iranian people; Attack on oil platforms of Iran; Drowning a few Iranian ships;
1439 2018-07-23 20:56:21 @OfficeGSBrown @InstituteGC @theresa_may Can any of you let me know what has happened with North Sea Oil? We have apparently produced 5% more than Norway since the 1970s and they have a 1 Trillion Dollar Oil Fund. Asking for 6 million friends.
1440 2018-07-23 20:55:34 We are 2nd largest crude oil producers and produce 4.2% of Americas energy (#6). Pretty good for only having 9 people I'd say.

Co-wash the hair when you first get it and let it air dry 
Don’t use too much heat 
Do hot oil treatments before you insert the hair

1444 2018-07-23 20:55:01 I think I spent that much per month on motor oil for mine.
1445 2018-07-23 20:54:56 5 more years of this or rather far much worse than this since when the so called new era or is it error as he pronounces it came into effect,cash situation has worsened.

Currently there is acute shortage of cooking oil.

All they did was to remove excessive police from our roads
1446 2018-07-23 20:54:56 Oil? Or just as they are? I could give it a go I suppose

1451 2018-07-23 20:53:48 Dude I didn't know that.  Where can I order some of your olive oil?  Would love to spread the word and support.
1452 2018-07-23 20:53:41 This means #PentaNova can sell 20 million shares without going to the market for a  new Financing and they can effectively raise the money needed to buy the Alianza cash call from the State Oil company in Argentina without diluting shareholders.
1453 2018-07-23 20:53:35 Did you see our message from last week? We want to make sure you get your free oil change kit!
1454 2018-07-23 20:53:24 3+ hours for a fucking oil change, are you kidding me? @Galpinford
1455 2018-07-23 20:53:17 Actually using oil get your face clean quicker. It's a matter of smoothing on  and rubbing off with a flannel. I don't always wear makeup. I use hemp oil at night and a face soap bar in the am. My skin is the best it's been for a long time

1465 2018-07-23 20:52:37 "The Endeepee Commies are out to destroy Alberta with crossdressing men in womens changeroomz and killin oil jerbs!"

1466 2018-07-23 20:52:31 They verified Page met with reps from state-owned Oil co Rosneft. Russia's disinformation adds in swing states. & Trump's relationship with Agalarov. All else unproven. So most damaging is Page... Why hasn't he been arrested? Could be he was working for FBI.
1467 2018-07-23 20:52:18 Amin dear
1468 2018-07-23 20:52:10 Iran is America's ally in our fight against ISIS, but Trump is too stupid to know that.
Trump prefers the money and oil of Saudi Arabia, you know, the country whose terrorists bombed the World Trade Center and Pentagon?  The country whose people secretly support ISIS?
1469 2018-07-23 20:51:55 Waiting for a much-needed oil change on my car. Time to play more GBF weeeee
1470 2018-07-23 20:51:55 Do you expect Exon Mobil, shell and BP etc to give you job or even pay taxes? This was the purpose of the invasion in the first place. Ask your govt to renationalise your oil industry
1471 2018-07-23 20:51:31 Our idea worked great when we overthrew a democratically elected Mossadegh in 1953 and installed the Shah..US foreign policy = Keep overthrowing foreign governments so certain special interest groups keep making billions of dollars. This is all over oil & natural gas pipelines.
1472 2018-07-23 20:51:27 This natural stuff was fun but I’m getting back into my wigs and beat face. Idc if guys like “natural girls” or if natural hair and coconut oil on your face is what’s “in” , getting glam’d up has ALWAYS been my thing lol

1475 2018-07-23 20:50:47 I agree with you there,the Saudi’s have that oil I suppose.

1482 2018-07-23 20:50:16 But but it will pay for itself! The oil, remember?
1483 2018-07-23 20:50:10 Look at the Standard Oil case. They controlled production and distribution and then the gas stations became franchises after the break up. They may not continue to manage them but having a trusted brand in what seems to be the future of travel probably isn't bad.

1504 2018-07-23 20:47:40 Has every country that has sought independence from the UK and set up their own currency required a surplus?  No. Deficits are a normal part of running a modern country and every country (bar those who didn't squander oil) have one.

1509 2018-07-23 20:47:04 Out the West in the Dragons. Western firms are gradually losing interest in Iraq’s oil, in spite of its extensive and low-cost reserves. On the other hand Asian companies pushed by security of supply concerns are willing to accept the very low margins offered.

1 ha @ 70% coverage = 7000 sqm
200 grams per sqm
140 kg per ha per harvest
10% oil yield @ 90% purity = 14 kg per ha per harvest
14kg X $10,000 = $140,000 gross per hectare.

1614 2018-07-23 20:31:26 Coconut oil, body lotion or for cooking?
1615 2018-07-23 20:31:25 Not just oil. The us backed islam karimov for uranium, mobutu sese seko for coltan and cobalt, castillo armas and other guatemalan dictators for bananas and more. And the us got involved in iraq during the 60s by backing the baathist coup against abd al karim qasim.
1616 2018-07-23 20:31:10 it turns out I can eat stuff fried in peanut oil

1618 2018-07-23 20:30:59 The outside air carried with it all the sounds and smells of Japanese springtime. The sweet smells of sakura and plum. Cicadas buzzing so loud it sounded like the trees were breathing. The sun painted the rooftops gold. Oil on canvas. A Kyoto I'd never seen. #MuseMon
1619 2018-07-23 20:30:53 Anyone have experience of obtaining cannabis oil in Ireland?or know of its use / effectiveness in cancer treatment?

1626 2018-07-23 20:30:15 Yo the worst part of this summer is my coconut oil melting then me spilling it all
1627 2018-07-23 20:30:03 We are like oil and water, there is no chance of us ever getting along
1628 2018-07-23 20:29:45 Doesn't matter. That Russian oil money keeps flowing in so she'll say whatever her corporate overlords command of her.
1629 2018-07-23 20:29:39 Fam it’s actually bare hot you know, I’m sure if I put coconut oil in my hair I’ll burst into flames and look like Ghost Rider
1630 2018-07-23 20:29:35 Came for an oil change left with a fucked up ignition. Now I’m here again to see if they can fix it if not they need to order a new ignition cylinder.
1631 2018-07-23 20:29:28 Its so funny how our media houses refused to carry  the news of the sad event that occurred yesterday along The Notorious Kaduna/Abuja highway because it won't suite their usual Fulani herdsmen narrative.
1632 2018-07-23 20:29:23 He's not concerned at all. He wants war to shore up his ratings and he wants their oil.  Deja Vu all over again! My husband served 28 yrs in the Army, 18 months in Iraq and this is just another oil grab. @realDonaldTrump the draft dodger needs to back off the war talk-Unqualified
1633 2018-07-23 20:29:02 I spot tested my new @TanologistTan by @lottietommo oil drops and now I look like I have a skin deformity  gonna need to fix that up soon hahaha
1634 2018-07-23 20:29:01 Check out the hashtag #StopMeddlinginIran. The world is sick of the US government's greedy and psychotic geopolitics. We already killed their attempt at democracy in order to help Britain keep looting their oil. Just #leaveIranalone!

1636 2018-07-23 20:28:53 That's a government and corruption issue. Nigeria isn't the only country where oil is found or has been drilled from. 

Let's even say by a stroke of magic, Niger deltans are given back their waterways and the polluted land.  Will that deter them from wanting to run abroad?
1637 2018-07-23 20:28:49 #RyanZinke Chief at .@Interior is worse than #Pruitt I have read. He is PRO oil drilling, PRO hunting, definitely NOT for protecting the planet resources.

1640 2018-07-23 20:28:12 If you don’t have a brush cleaner and conditioner, here are some recipes

Use dish soap and olive oil mixture to clean your brushes. If you want you can also substitute the dish soap to baby wash.

1644 2018-07-23 20:27:34 Selling my altima, 1998 with 190k. Has aftermarket speakers all around, aftermarket radio with Bluetooth and subs in the trunk. Oil changes ever 3-5k miles. Well taken care of. If you or someone you know is looking for a cheap/reliable car dm me for more info
1645 2018-07-23 20:27:29 Quote of my day: Data is the new oil
1646 2018-07-23 20:27:24 Wore my expensive ass primer today after Fenty, MAC & NARS have been leaving me an oil slick mess. 

So far, not a single trace of oil. Makeup perfectly in tact.
1647 2018-07-23 20:26:59 I said this once abt Nigeria years ago & a guy told me to gerraoutta here, that we have oil. I kuku gerrout no ni. Google is  one company o.
1648 2018-07-23 20:26:48 Pompeo n Bolton are all about going to war w/Iraq. Why not send Trumpsters only to fight his war. Then they can take the oil. Remember that one?
1649 2018-07-23 20:26:46 Not true!

Part of gop effort to get National Parks lands for their donors!

This is chaired by Rob Bishop - R Utah.

So in his case part of stealing lands like Bears Ears for miners & oil!

Do we want to see Yosemite or Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon destroyed by them?
1650 2018-07-23 20:26:37 They have a cup of thick hot chocolate for dunking. It's more like pudding. Also, no sugar on the churros and the churros are about the size of hot dog buns. They make them in these huge pans of oil and pour the batter in spirals to cook.
1651 2018-07-23 20:26:28 ExxonMobil says there’s more oil offshore Guyana than it first thought...
1652 2018-07-23 20:26:25 What oil you refine & how well you can refine it depends on what pipelines you've built, where your worker is, the length of the pipelines, the preset required pipe length, how much $ you have, etc
1653 2018-07-23 20:26:24 Holistic tip, rubbing peppermint oil on your hands and inhaling it helps with stress, anxiety, breathing, headaches, and nauseous.... it also helps with memory and can help you focus

1655 2018-07-23 20:26:10 Hey @chigrl, what is your take on a possible war with Iran in correlation to Crude. Are we going to see another oil bull market such as the one from the start of 2002 when US declared war with Iraq/Afghanistan? Thanks in advance.

1659 2018-07-23 20:25:38 A complaint from me too @VP Pence. No tax cut; no check difference. Almost $1B new debt for the country. On top of your costing Indiana millions with your homophobia, & your families’ oil company unpaid/bankrupt gas company land contamination! Stop helping us you wad.

1661 2018-07-23 20:25:23 Let's get Alaska in the mix, so that the U.S. can be #1 in oil.
1662 2018-07-23 20:25:20 The economy is getting worse every day. The 10 year is up 4 points today. Meat prices, & all other food items are soaring, housing has been declining because of high pries for three months in a row, and oil is continuing to rise. All factors are indicative of another recession.
1663 2018-07-23 20:25:09 @AriFleischer worked like a charm in Iraq, over 200K civilian deaths, for cheap oil.  You played a role in that. #bloodonyourhands #womenandcildren

1665 2018-07-23 20:24:46 Worker placement where the space you select is limited by how far your worker (or workers) is from the space you want to use. You're building a unique set of pipelines, buying different types of oil, selling to various markets, and more.
1666 2018-07-23 20:24:34 It's all about the oil and gas industry and where they can drill. It's an abomination.
1667 2018-07-23 20:24:32 If anybody is considering getting CBD oil I highly highly recommend!!!! I’ve only been on it for a week and it is seriously saving my sanity
1668 2018-07-23 20:24:31 It isn’t revenue neutral and it doesn’t freeze regulations on oil and gas emissions, two of the demands Exxon and its ilk insist upon as quid pro quo.
1669 2018-07-23 20:24:06 Woke up early to drop family at the airport, then made the most of it and visited family and got an oil change. My children don't seem onboard for a nap.  #momof3
1670 2018-07-23 20:24:05 Coconut oil is honestly a gift from god himself like you want glowing skin?? Coconut oil. You want silky hair?? Coconut oil. You want something to put on your toast in the morning?? COCONUT OIL
1671 2018-07-23 20:24:02 U can try coconut oil and vaseline combination every night..hopefully it'll work faster 
1672 2018-07-23 20:23:59 Not even close. I thought it might mean 5 big ingredients plus a spice or oil here or there but no. 10 or less maybe.
1673 2018-07-23 20:23:55 I always hear the same thing. I'm convinced fish oil pills help though.
1674 2018-07-23 20:23:26 Taking body scrub recommendations. Honey is too expensive to be wasting and I don't feel like mixing coconut oil in a mason jar rn.
1675 2018-07-23 20:23:23 Oil prices edged lower on Monday as the focus turned to oversupply worries, moving away from escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which had driven prices higher early in the session.

Is Trump trying to get into the Oil Business with Putin.  Sure looks that way to me.

Oil is where the real money is, not in Hotels.
1686 2018-07-23 20:22:19 Quicklane sure is quick if it takes 2 and a half hours for an oil change
1687 2018-07-23 20:22:15 I almost always have a coconut oil in treatment in my hair. So if it ever looks greasy 99% chance it’s organic coconut oil. Getting ready to go back blonde.

1698 2018-07-23 20:20:51 I'm having trouble figuring out exact years, but it looks like maybe the oil crisis?
1699 2018-07-23 20:20:50 I think that might be best...or maybe water-soluble oil paints? Those might be good too. I worked with them for a while and painted out in my garage for a bit. Not sure if they're as good as oils, but maybe a safer substitute..?

1715 2018-07-23 20:19:11  Clay masks are an incredible remedy for oily and acne-prone skin. A clay mask can “soak” up excess sebum and clean out any clogged pores from the resulting excess oil.
1716 2018-07-23 20:19:01 I went to the wrong place to get my oil changed.  When the man gave me the price, I asked him for a senior citizen’s discount 
1717 2018-07-23 20:18:52 When mine erupt it will be like that. So I am told. Clove oil might help a bit. And industrial quantities of alcohol. Sprits mainly.
1718 2018-07-23 20:18:49 Okay, oil, gas, electric, cable, airline, auto, Apple, Sinclair Media, etc. Amazon may get on this list too if they start screwing us like the rest of them. Wa Po may be conservative leaning but last time I checked, real news, Spanky.

What was your experience? Did it help? Where did you buy your products?

Thanks!

1749 2018-07-23 20:15:07 It's always about the oil. Every move they make is about the oil.
1750 2018-07-23 20:15:05 #SaudiArabia and #Kuwait will form a cooperation council that will likely see the two #GCC countries restarting production on joint #oil fields #GlobalTrade #GlobalKnowledge
1751 2018-07-23 20:14:57 Speaking of Russia, Wisconsin fracking sand will help us to overcome those commies in oil output by next year.  *high five*
1752 2018-07-23 20:14:43 .@SenSanders Please help.  WHO CAN STOP THE FOOLS FROM GUTTING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT??  Sponsored by oil lobbyists.  It took so long to clean the air and water, and save habitats; now it's going backwards!!!
1753 2018-07-23 20:14:39 Yes and yum!! Or steamed with olive oil, garlic cloves, cracked black pepper, smoked sea salt and smoked paprika 
1754 2018-07-23 20:14:15 Just had a massage and I am in my element, I’m a new woman, smothered in coconut oil but I don’t even care because I finally feel 22 and not 82
1755 2018-07-23 20:14:07 Just the other day you said you are all about diplomacy! What, it depends who it is? Hungry for more Muslim blood and oil!? F@#$& you!
1756 2018-07-23 20:14:00 Even @CAMRA_Official was taken in by the pubco shilling. The fact is people don't use run down smelly pubs that have been chronically starved of investment for decades under the snake oil of the pubco 'low cost entry' business model. Of course WE don't use unfit for purpose pubs
1757 2018-07-23 20:13:50 My mom is a mess. You are supposed to put cleansing oil on a dry face -> cleanse -> add some water -> cleanse and then wash it off but she mixed it with water from the start lol she has apparently been doing this for a long time. Good thing I caught her
1758 2018-07-23 20:13:44 Definitely burning the midnight oil
1759 2018-07-23 20:13:44 Waiting to get my oil changed and decided to catch the lunch buffet at mountain mikes. Haven't had a solo lunch date in a long time .
1760 2018-07-23 20:13:29 Ugh need to change my oil
1761 2018-07-23 20:13:26 yooooo olive oil, f my ish up 
1762 2018-07-23 20:13:26 I’ve had lumpy fingers for a while, but no pain. Started taking the cod liver oil capsules on GP’s advice because my hips were getting creaky. Sorted in days. If you get them, make sure they’re high strength. V cheap.
1763 2018-07-23 20:13:22 You have to make your own olive oil to reach grande Italiano level lol
1764 2018-07-23 20:13:03 Google standing rock, that cleanup cost millions. The oil sector provides jobs, taxes and royalties that fund our social services. The protestors are nothing more than parisites, they contribute nothing to our society.
1765 2018-07-23 20:13:00 Baby oil for what? Fuck Alex
1766 2018-07-23 20:12:57 hot oil?
1767 2018-07-23 20:12:52 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
1768 2018-07-23 20:12:52 it also would boost russia oil $$$$$  
1769 2018-07-23 20:12:41 Baby oil is for that inner thigh, booty massage. Unamassage mpaka karibu na miaow lakini hugusi. By the time unamaliza gyaldem anatetemeka tu mguu, amesoak sheets kama facken.
1770 2018-07-23 20:12:39 A lot of people i know keep telling me to go out into the oil business, but fuck man idk.
1771 2018-07-23 20:12:37 Make sure to season with olive oil, salt, pepper, some garlic, and a little bit of Rosemary xD
1772 2018-07-23 20:12:32 Audi’s are cool and all until you have to get an oil change 
1773 2018-07-23 20:12:27 Chips are not just a tasty snack. Fat, oil, and the chemicals in potato chips make them a perfect fire-starting material. #lifehack
1774 2018-07-23 20:12:25 That’s what @NotDeadGlomar says McMuffin did. Sold where the oil maps are in Iraq/Afghanistan are to Goldman Sachs in order to get his job there. WHY ELSE would they want him?
1775 2018-07-23 20:12:24 It might start with provocative incidents in the Straights of Hormuz, trump knows he could do what Johnson did...another Hormuz Persian Gulf Resolution. War Baby! War! Oh yeah Vlad gets to sell his oil, we might make certain other oil radioactive for 1000 years.
1776 2018-07-23 20:12:17 Crude Oil Prices Surge as Iran Threatens to Close Major Oil Chokepoint

1777 2018-07-23 20:12:14 It all stems from Iran continuing with nuke research. And because they are Trump is thinking imposing oil sanctions to try to persuade. And yes in a way iran did threaten. "Playing with lions tail" . Peace with Iran is a great peace. War with Iran is a great war.
1778 2018-07-23 20:12:12 Oil Prices Unfazed by Trump Warning Shot- Charts Highlight July RangeThe near-term correction in crude oil prices appears to have stalled even as U.S. President Donald Trump fires warning shots against Ir...
1779 2018-07-23 20:11:56 nobody had 31 million barrels per day available, we're currently using 6 barrels of oil for each new barrel that is discovered, we're 13 years past peak and on the back slope of Hubbard's curve
1780 2018-07-23 20:11:44 #Papusha is an excellent #ICO that will make the entire world so much greener, this project aims to remove all the toxins that comes with the fuel that we are using today, it will come up w/ ways in order to make fuel cheaper by obtaining it through wastes such as oil. #Crowdsale

1782 2018-07-23 20:11:36 I still don't get it.  How the hell does Israel have such a grip on us that they can make us do stuff that will cost trillions?  Or are they a sock puppet for our banks, oil companies, & military industrial complex, charged with stirring the pot?
1783 2018-07-23 20:11:35 I told you... just kissing... the hideaway went to a waste, the baby oil stayed full and the lingerie should have stayed with the tags on #loveisland
1784 2018-07-23 20:11:30 What might be wrong with people. Lately been listening whine about how damn hot it is. Told its sad none have taken climate change as true, most have said climate has changed always. How about leisure use of oil and other resources? When told that they left or tried change topic
1785 2018-07-23 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: raw crust with chunky motor oil and pineapple.
1786 2018-07-23 20:11:01 #LoveIsland Alexandra came with baby oil and lingerie. If she can walk this morning I'll be highly disappointed
1787 2018-07-23 20:10:53 Gosh it's the mark of a hot summer when one's coconut oil doesn't solidify for weeks....
1788 2018-07-23 20:10:45 Bearish on oil. Google reported and the stock skyrocketed. TD Ameritrade reported and beat. Market gonna love these strong ER's...
1789 2018-07-23 20:10:44 What Donald Trump is doing with the Trade war will cause more harm than good. To add salt, the oil war threats flying uppandan with Iran isn't looking good if they decide to carry out their threat of disrupting the oil chokehold. We all will suffer it.
1790 2018-07-23 20:10:42 Is it a tub filled with baby oil or is that how his skin reacts to fluid?
1791 2018-07-23 20:10:30 bombs still working+skin oil i got

1794 2018-07-23 20:10:16 I got 25 dollars a month more. I’m giving it all to big Oil through higher gas prices. Republicans always have been owned by Big Oil. But every thing is going up. Just go shopping Puppet Pence
1795 2018-07-23 20:10:11 .@RepSwalwell PLEASE try to stop them from eviscerating the Endangered Species Act. The only criterion is corporate profit -- oil companies etc.  What has happened to people.  It took so long to clean the air and water, and now.....
1796 2018-07-23 20:10:11 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1797 2018-07-23 20:10:03 SHOUT OUT TO THE OREGANO OIL GODS CAUSE MY THROAT WAS SORE ALL WEEKEND BUT NOW ITS GONE THANK YOUUUUU
1798 2018-07-23 20:09:55 I need to change my oil, but it’s just toooo hot outside man 
1799 2018-07-23 20:09:52 Alex dont deserve that baby oil Alexandra Hun  #LoveIsland
1800 2018-07-23 20:09:34 Please call your reps & help save the #EndangeredSpeciesAct because habitats for countless organisms are in real danger of losing protection & being destroyed. Big oil and big business don’t care about the health of our environment or our future. #PleaseCare
1801 2018-07-23 20:09:33 What's the ingredient limiting you there?
Palm oil or the vegetables?
1802 2018-07-23 20:09:30 Oh yes please! Perfect to help me even out my complexion in a nice Matt finish that is perfect for my nicely maturing skin, oil free is a bonus too as it’ll be a perfect base for makeup or if I’m feeling brave going commando 
1803 2018-07-23 20:09:23 Again with the "I do my own work on my car except for oil changes" shit.

Good for you. Have fun getting your window to roll back up since you neglected to, you know, tell us that it doesn't fucking work!
1804 2018-07-23 20:09:21 Brush 
#PicoFire

Pico Cyn - 4-5 Acres MROS Med to heavy brush. It’s a couple miles back in the oil fields. 


1805 2018-07-23 20:09:16 I need a oil change TODAY!!!!
1806 2018-07-23 20:09:10 The deep learning snake oil salesmen have been busy over the last several years but the word is getting out that deep learning is not all it's cracked up to be. In fact, DL is a major annoying distraction on the road to L5.
1807 2018-07-23 20:09:09 I bought some coconut oil today and I don't even know how to use it...  


1808 2018-07-23 20:09:03 These economic and oil sanctions are putting some serious pressure on those ruthless dictator mullahs.  Perhaps a Green Revolution 2.0 is in the works? #IranProtests
1809 2018-07-23 20:08:55 Pia baby oil unaeza paka kwa mapera haha
1810 2018-07-23 20:08:45 You have to give hitch hike in an old oil leaking Dacia a try!
1811 2018-07-23 20:08:39 Um, because it’s about making more money for Trump friends in oil/gas/logging. Not about making more money for NPS.
1812 2018-07-23 20:08:35 [UPDATE: #PicoFire] {Stevenson Ranch} this is now the #PicoFire; LAC E124 o/s 2 miles into oil field property.. 4-5 acres in medium to heavy brush with moderate rate of spread. No structures threatened.
1813 2018-07-23 20:08:30 Same!  Baby oil and iodine OH and Sun'in for the hair (ugh)
1814 2018-07-23 20:08:24 Ice and baby oil!!!!!!!!
1815 2018-07-23 20:08:17 @UKLabour Paul Sweeney doing a great job, at 100 miles an hour, on behalf on the Tories (again). 
Scotland - Too Wee Too Poor Too Stupid - in his opinion. Usual 2014 stuff ... fiscal transfer, currency, deficits, even the oil price  ..  shameful #indyref2
1816 2018-07-23 20:08:15 Let me make this crystal clear: I don’t like Russia, I don’t fear Russia, If Russia wants to threaten the US, BRING IT! They have 1/10 of our GNP. Cut off operation of their oil wells, and turn Putin’s  lights off for a week. Bring Putin in this November so it Hurts the GOP.
1817 2018-07-23 20:08:15 Baby oil ?
1818 2018-07-23 20:08:14 Putting the aroma oil to the humidifier.
1819 2018-07-23 20:08:14 I swear the subway on 280 makes me so mad. Last time i said just a little bit of salt and pepper and they put so much on it i could barely eat it. This time i say just a little bit of oil and vinegar and i watch them drown that shit. Whats so hard about just a little???

And economically we can survive if corruption, over spending, hoarding, focus on military stops.  Fix gas and oil technology
1822 2018-07-23 20:07:54  nah that baby oil went to waste  #LoveIsland
1823 2018-07-23 20:07:52 Hillary Clinton is leaking? Leaking what? Blood, oil, transmission fluid?
1824 2018-07-23 20:07:51 Hey @PaulJSweeney How on earth do other countries around the world ever survive without England? Seriously? Can you tell me how other countries (most with no oil, whisky, fishing, renewables etc etc etc) manage to be independent without England? Only Scotland? REALLY?
1825 2018-07-23 20:07:50 Hhhhhh
1826 2018-07-23 20:07:44 Two hours in a dentist chair only to have to go back for about three more. It was like going in for an oil change and now needing a new transmission. 

 (However - I asked about the transmission before we even got started).  


1827 2018-07-23 20:07:25 #EthicalHour  my family are now more conscious about purchasing products with palm oil
1828 2018-07-23 20:07:14 I opened up Pokemon Go and caught a Numel while my oil was getting changed. The guy told me congrats on catching a Pokemon when I went to pay. It was playing over Bluetooth. Whoops.
1829 2018-07-23 20:07:06 oh! I use argan oil brand??
1830 2018-07-23 20:06:57 Rub in and massage for a tiny bit a bit of castor oil on your eyebrows every night
1831 2018-07-23 20:06:53 Oil change now my baby driving real right 
1832 2018-07-23 20:06:39 Data is everything but the new oil. Oil is finite.
1833 2018-07-23 20:06:35 Hmm, that is trickier, you can emulsify olive oil and vinegar together, you just need to take it slow.....#ethicalhour
1834 2018-07-23 20:06:31 Debbie's in a film on telly, please stop confusing me, is she in Hungary or not  #thearchers @BBCTheArchers
1835 2018-07-23 20:06:30 Alexandra got baby oil 
1836 2018-07-23 20:06:24 While in water fish eat insect, in absence of water insect eat fish, to make soap oil is necessary but to clean greasy stuff soap is needed that’s life no one can be self sufficient. We need each other at some point of time. Be careful how we treat each other. The irony of life.
1837 2018-07-23 20:06:17 teacher: who is your favorite celebrity?

1838 2018-07-23 20:06:17 Nahhj Alexandra has got the oil ready #LoveIsland
1839 2018-07-23 20:06:14 My best idea ever was, after getting a Burroughs B9000 mini computer up and running, and finishing the oil company payroll that had crashed, was to send those checks to those men if possible with a "Sorry for the delay" note. (It crashed in the late 70s. This was 1996)
1840 2018-07-23 20:06:12 You misunderstood me. I mean, they say the oil is nationalized, but they give contacts to their family members and friends, with huge margins, they install crap equipment, destroy the country, get paid from sale of oil, and the people get nothing.
1841 2018-07-23 20:06:04 She’s really gonna give it to him today 

Is that even baby oil in her hand I’m screaming
1842 2018-07-23 20:06:02 Wait she has baby oil in hand  #LoveIsland
1843 2018-07-23 20:06:01 @susansiman yes ya 2 prices r going jump up alot I'm glad I paid attention to my cousins n their dads fixing cars n trucks n soon all cars will be required to have synthetic oil change n that's already 70 a change in Waunakee shop plus oil company r working on a new oil 0/16 oil
1844 2018-07-23 20:05:58 My good bitch walking in there with baby oil and wipes. Queen  #LoveIsland
1845 2018-07-23 20:05:46 Not scared. Lol. Follow what he’s doing. Just gave you an example. -
Another is crippling Iran. Think no oil from Iran is helping Russia? Think stopping Germany from an oil pipeline with Russia helps Putin?  Get informed.
1846 2018-07-23 20:05:39 Is that baby oil in her hand? nahhhhhhh this brudda don deserve this!!! #LoveIsland
1847 2018-07-23 20:05:33 #isitok  that Australia wont even consider cannabis oil as a treatement for illnesses #stillinthedarkages
1848 2018-07-23 20:05:26 Ummmm.  Probably true. Unless Rosneft floods the market with all that oil Exxon found a few years back.
1849 2018-07-23 20:05:13  #MindfulMonday Tip: Want a new way to cook veggies? Try grilling! Spray lightly w/ oil & grill to barely tender. Finish with fresh lemon juice!
1850 2018-07-23 20:05:11 It was the plan Putin put in place w trump for 2 hours. Putin wants oil and trump wants real estate.
1851 2018-07-23 20:05:08 I've been watching @bbceastenders since way before Christmas and that bottle of cooking oil on top of Karen's fridge hasn't went down one little bit  #EastEnders

Pfftttt...
1853 2018-07-23 20:05:04 eg ... what does the Inquisition have to do w/ Christianity?
or the Hammer & Sickle Flag have to do w/ Karl Marx?
or trickle down no bid contracts & bailouts have to do w/ Capitalism?
or undeclared wars for oil have to do w/ Democracy or Freedom?
or .. MON89034 have to do w/ corn
1854 2018-07-23 20:05:00 How are the oil prices??
1855 2018-07-23 20:05:00 Just look at the defense, medical, banking, oil, insurance, etc... industries and watch how they manipulate the market for their own gain using federal and state governments. Instead of allowing consumers to decide.
1856 2018-07-23 20:04:45 Shower it with golden oil, spank it and serve it with Russian Potato Okroshka.
1857 2018-07-23 20:04:42 So you've got folk classification overlain with botanical definitions (which work well w grasses and legumes but not so helpful with oil seeds etc) and with inconsistent nutritional, culinary, commercial understandings. And advertising.
1858 2018-07-23 20:04:29 I’d rather walk. I hate having to do car business so much I forgot my inspection was up and caught a ticket in the city, Meanwhile I also need an oil change and just paid for a tire. Hate it.
1859 2018-07-23 20:04:29 How do these girls get their teeth so white? I’ve used coconut oil, the charcoal shit, other shit, and more shit. WHAT IS THE FUCKING SECRET
1860 2018-07-23 20:04:27 Toxic oil extraction in Livermore threatens our precious groundwater in Alameda County. With the chance of drought, we need to do all we can to protect our water. @Keith_Carson @Scott_Haggerty @Nate_Miley plz deny E&B’s permit + #ProtectLivermore
1861 2018-07-23 20:04:26 Now if I spooned the oil over them... ;)
1862 2018-07-23 20:04:11 aw here we go.....oil makes Scotland poor...
1863 2018-07-23 20:04:09 You don't know true love and admiration of a woman until you rub her down with some baby oil
1864 2018-07-23 20:04:01 Yes far too many NATO countries indocrinate fine young men and women to serve using the flag and national pride as a brainwashing tool to fight these unconstitutional globalist wars for their NWO takeover agenda to seize and try to monopolize the foreirgn oil, drug trade, etc
1865 2018-07-23 20:04:01 I'm working on vegan mayo recipes at the moment, silken tofu, olive oil and mustard works well. #ethicalhour
1866 2018-07-23 20:03:48 And by the way: I was asking you what YOU think. If you had foreign troops overthrow your government, have soldiers in your state for generations, taking minerals and oil out of your country. What would you do? Rise up? Why wouldn’t they? No one asked the US to go to Iran.
1867 2018-07-23 20:03:47 maybe old carti w a mexiko dro prod.
1868 2018-07-23 20:03:45 Just a week ago I was certain my sweet dog wouldn't be around much longer. A few days on #CBD oil and it's been a complete 180!  So pleased! #dogmom #pittienation
1869 2018-07-23 20:03:35 I suppose they might consume less n-6 oil... could, but not all.

1872 2018-07-23 20:03:31 procrastination level driving 2 months w my change oil light on
1873 2018-07-23 20:03:23 Sorry just saw this. Boy do I have recs. Lush's Ro's Argan is amazing. I use that plus Cerave's Daily Moisturizing Lotion, a little pricey. Doesn't leave me feeling tacky/greasy. In winter times I mix in a little jojoba/argan/rosehip oil, all very light and highly absorbent.
1874 2018-07-23 20:03:11 All I want for my 26 birthday is a trip to Dubai and a nice red oil potato greens with enough pepper serve is that too much to ask for?
1875 2018-07-23 20:03:10 Immediately he rebuffed their appeasement with dangling carrots , oil fields and automatic ticket, they suddenly realized he has a case to answer again. It will backfire again @bukolasaraki @officialKolaO @babaidris090 @lindaikeji @atiku @MBuhari @NGRPresident @PDPVanguard
1876 2018-07-23 20:03:08 Has anyone in my followers been hitting that CBD oil? In all seriousness I mean has anyone tried CBD oil for medicinal reasons? Seems a lot of buzz about it.
1877 2018-07-23 20:03:00 back to GT:NH today - prepping ourselves for oil
1878 2018-07-23 20:02:59 Errytime I get a oil change the person ringing me up say damn u picked a hell of a car smh tell me bout it 
1879 2018-07-23 20:02:54 I understand the importance of it and how ~30% of seaborne oil passes through there. I was searching for a word and that's what came out. Thanks for pointing out my error. It happens.
1880 2018-07-23 20:02:53 In example 1, he was not criticizing a company but suggested that oil industry was in good health & did not need a tax break.
In 2nd instance, he criticized an industry behavior, altho he used Staples as an illustrative example, he was clear to be talking abt a common behavior /1

1882 2018-07-23 20:02:45 .@SpeakerRyan If you have one shred of decency left, DO NOT allow the gutting of the Endangered Species Act by oil lobbyists!!  What the hell is wrong with you people?  You are destroying the environment and wildlife without a thought.
1883 2018-07-23 20:02:34 OK I get it simple no money no real love what if her guy cannot afford her Italian dish there is no crime taking her out to a joint where they sell roasted fish, yam and plantain with a nice oil made stew you can never compare that with the Italian dish African foods rocks.

1887 2018-07-23 20:02:07 Alan Dershowitz might not have received your apology request. Last I heard, Alan was giving O.J. Simpson a hot oil rubdown. Might wanna  leave Alan a note at O.J.'s hangout The Slice & Run Pub $ Grill. Alan isn't welcome in the Hamptons anymore.

1889 2018-07-23 20:02:01 Dad took my car to get an oil change & he filled up my tank <3333
1890 2018-07-23 20:01:59 Trump's bolts are so loose, he's leaking oil.
1891 2018-07-23 20:01:47 Well now I don't really put anything in it. But over the years I've used argon oil, coconut oil, argon oil mixed with a little gel.
1892 2018-07-23 20:01:45 @realDonaldTrump  DEF systems make EPA diesel fuel regulations obsolete. Recalculate. Re: Urban zones & seasonal modified blends. Diesel prices need to come down, drastically. Americans should benefit from off the charts domestic oil production. $3.00 plus a gallon is suspicious.

1894 2018-07-23 20:01:34 For most market analysts and traders, the oil market outlook remains fundamentally tight, with strong growth in consumption, while production continues to be disrupted by problems in Venezuela and Libya.
1895 2018-07-23 20:01:32 What about that but at my friend’s oil defuser look like the Mets' biggest fan, not their biggest player.
1896 2018-07-23 20:01:28 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
1897 2018-07-23 20:01:26 Tin of chickpeas, drained. Scatter on a baking tray. Spray with olive oil, salt and your seasoning of choice (paprika, chipotle, old bay or whatever) and roast until golden and super crunchy. Super satisfying.
1898 2018-07-23 20:01:14 Ya I member. That series actually doesn't bug me too much. 2009 vs Pens, 2006 vs the Oil, 2003 vs the Ducks, 1996 vs the Avs- Those are the series that stick in my craw.
1899 2018-07-23 20:01:07 #Iran has 12% #unemployment, an inflation rate of 159%, 500,000 bbl/day less oil export than a year ago, and an increasingly discontent population.
1900 2018-07-23 20:00:50 Then anyone with a dollar to spare and half a brain would do well to invest in anything that had anything to do with oil pricing.

1903 2018-07-23 20:00:33 I've studied the future of oil/energy since I became peak oil aware in 2005. A war of this type would take 1/3 of the world's oil supply off the market. If a human dehydrates 10% the body collapses, 30% cut in oil is a societal collapse, no one goes to work, supply chains fail
1904 2018-07-23 20:00:32 Except maybe oil and gas sha that's the cake.
1905 2018-07-23 20:00:32 To tired for someone else to change ur oil?

1915 2018-07-23 19:59:53 Portfolio managers also cut net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-17 million barrels) and European gasoil (-25 million barrels).
1916 2018-07-23 19:59:36 @AutoNation sad thing is that I was in for a scheduled oil change about 2 weeks ago and it took over an hour and a half. Why?

1918 2018-07-23 19:59:20 A FISA warrant is redacted to the point of practically being useless , but tens of thousands of people roam the country with varying degrees of security clearance? It defies common sense
1919 2018-07-23 19:58:58 Oil and other things.
1920 2018-07-23 19:58:53 Oh brilliant! I didn't know about the sun oil so I've learnt something today! :)
1921 2018-07-23 19:58:51 Dipped the tip of my middle finger in boiling oil. Yay me.
1922 2018-07-23 19:58:43 The reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market, where positions were slashed by 170 million barrels, as managers took profits after the year-long rally in oil prices.
1923 2018-07-23 19:58:40 Bought a new spice rack and an olive oil pour thing and it’s easily my favorite purchases this year
1924 2018-07-23 19:58:39 I hear great things about them and I haven't used oil before so I'm really eager!
1925 2018-07-23 19:58:39 Baby oil is amazing bro

1927 2018-07-23 19:58:10 The only thing in Man Shitty’s DNA is oil money
1928 2018-07-23 19:57:32 The UK are busy siphoning oil from  southern Cameroon and have no time for that. Ask new age oil
1929 2018-07-23 19:57:24 Compelling argument @The_Oilholic the gains to big oil will come from rolling out their efficient capital programmes which have been tested through various pilots in the (relatively) low price regime which looks like it’s over now.
1930 2018-07-23 19:57:09 Hi Dawn, today was wasn't so bad as it's been warm, but overcast. Pigs can't regulate their own temperature by sweating or panting so they rely on a mud wallow and sun oil (yes, really) to keep cool and protect their skin.
1931 2018-07-23 19:57:04 At least Standard Oil didn't squat on a globally-recognized @FIFAcom division 1 sanction for U.S. oil.
1932 2018-07-23 19:57:00 So if, for example Iran sunk lots of ships and block the Strait of Hormuz stopping all those oil tankers from delivering oil, and then bombed the oil wells and refinaries in Saudi Arabia, how would the US bases stop this?
1933 2018-07-23 19:56:58 Lordt  use black castor oil to thicken them back out
1934 2018-07-23 19:56:55 I need somebody to wash and oil my hair. Who got me?
1935 2018-07-23 19:56:34 By public access I'm guessing you mean mining and oil drilling companies.

1937 2018-07-23 19:56:16 A Middle Eastern woman at Bed Bath & Beyond was scared to ask me how to use coconut oil just now so she asked if I work there first. Then just stood there, mustering up the courage.

I have headphones in, a Target bag in my hand, a tote on arm and I’m dressed in workout clothes.
1938 2018-07-23 19:56:08 COLUMN-Hedge funds slash bullish oil positions after prices peak. Hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year, as the gentle profit-taking in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit.

1940 2018-07-23 19:56:03 Tell @NYCMayor aggressive subway panhandlers are oil executives so he does something about them.
1941 2018-07-23 19:55:59 Try a paste by mixing cortisone 10 and aquaphore. It helps it not be so inflamed. If the castor oil doesn’t help.
1942 2018-07-23 19:55:55 ok so last night i used the derma e microdermabrasion scrub and then the nourishing rose cleansing oil and my skin is clearing up. like overnight. i’m so glad i bought them at beautycon bc they actually work sksksk
1943 2018-07-23 19:55:45 people are selfish we only fight for religion, money and oil but never for humanity  our this planet
1944 2018-07-23 19:55:34 The great deal maker, making good on his greatest hit: REALLY BIG DEAL: The Presidency, for release of Sanctions (stay tuned, next episode) - Arctic oil deal, biggest in planet's history. Selling out the US, he bent the knee to Putin, helping infiltrate US govt. #TraitorTrump
1945 2018-07-23 19:55:09 Carpetbaggers on one side, snake oil salesmen on the other.
1946 2018-07-23 19:55:08 you need a nice pan or a decent amount of oil, make sure u press it a while, and once you add it to the pan leave it for several mins before you try to flip it! And make sure the oil is heated before you add the tofu. It took me forever to perfect this lmao
1947 2018-07-23 19:55:07 Non-political debate since there is so much controversy around erdogan. Özil Took ages to respond and just poured oil in the fire. Not saying it’s entirely his fault at all tho. DFB, the media and Özil made mistakes. It’s not as black and white as people always want it to be.
1948 2018-07-23 19:54:54 Yeah I really slacked on this oil change 
1949 2018-07-23 19:54:49 No oil, no war, no killing ! Amen !
1950 2018-07-23 19:54:49 You said “dabbing the oil” and I immediately pictured someone smoking pizza grease out the dab rig
1951 2018-07-23 19:54:44 Exactly!! More expensive paints that don't use shitty binders and linseed oil only seem to be the way to go. I'm scared to try because losing $ if it doesn't work and I choke again though.
1952 2018-07-23 19:54:28 For face, or body?

Face: I use a lot of products, but to narrow the process down: toner (alcohol-free witch hazel/rosewater) to hydrate + hydrating serum, followed by lotion with hyaluronic acid to lock in that moisture, then seal with a richer cream/oil that isn't greasy.
1953 2018-07-23 19:54:07 I’m gonna slather you in lavender oil and throw you in a bath if u don’t calm it down (jk love u)

1957 2018-07-23 19:53:34 Remember: Without Scotland rUK would not have enough power, food or oil. It would have to import them from us which would make us richer and them poorer. That’s why they won’t let Scotland go. #DissolveTheUnion

1962 2018-07-23 19:52:42 The FP article mentioned falling investment in the oil patch plus concerns about NAFTA.  I replied that the oil patch US investment has bounced back. The Troymedia article doesn’t refute that because it doesn’t distinguish energy from anything else.
1963 2018-07-23 19:52:37 I've heard good things about topical CBD oil (which doesn't have to be derived from marijuana--it can come from hemp--so it is available even in states where marijuana is legal). That said, I have not tried it. Have you?
1964 2018-07-23 19:52:34 It's never been a civil war.  It was an invasion by wahhabi extreamists orchestrated by the west and it's allies with the goal of "regime change".  It's all about greed, oil, & money.  Stop pretending our gov't gives a damn about ppl.  Hammer in diplomacy toolbox, that's about it

1980 2018-07-23 19:49:50 You have to have lots of oil or a really good pan. Also you have to make sure the tofu has some of the water drained out and is not soft
1981 2018-07-23 19:49:48 Meanwhile kids are kidnapped and in cages, Putin is rigging 2018 races, protected species are being revoked, wilderness being destroyed by oil/gas mining, we've lost the respect and trust of our allies, and the Trump family and friends rake it in. #LockTrumpUp

1984 2018-07-23 19:49:34 There's only a few ways I personally  know of to not make it taste like cardboard. I always add some olive oil as well.
1985 2018-07-23 19:49:26 Because they have oil
1986 2018-07-23 19:49:15 I am not dumb ho% they come in rice and little oil cute rice forms.
1987 2018-07-23 19:49:11 what about.... coconut oil?
1988 2018-07-23 19:48:56 Also Neem oil. It’s great on garden bugs.
1989 2018-07-23 19:48:15 The costs dropped the last few years because oil got crushed and energy is the biggest cost for miners, but oil is going higher now and will effect earnings.
1990 2018-07-23 19:48:15 Waiting rooms while getting my oil changed will forever give me anxiety

1992 2018-07-23 19:48:05 (okay i swear i’m done after this) 

honestly, the key is to make sure your ends have more of what you’re putting in it. you putting in jojoba oil? ends need twice as much. leave-in? twice as much. and curl the ends (w/ya finger) so they’re not as exposed :)
1993 2018-07-23 19:47:02 Extra virgin olive oil like @GraysonDolan                                  - @EthanDolan
1994 2018-07-23 19:46:54 We are selling olive oil
1995 2018-07-23 19:46:46 If it’s like our shop that thing would have a bunch of 9/16 wrenches and motor oil in it the next morning.
1996 2018-07-23 19:46:37 Well shah didn’t do shit? Did Iran manufacture anything warfare medicine or Science or anything else during the time of shah? No. Maybe he build buildings and roads and train tracks but nothing else. UK and US were draining shah and Iran’s oil. And taking our money
1997 2018-07-23 19:46:34 Again, another wast of time and money. Assuming that oil and gas is responsible for climate change than the end user of the product is the one responsible. You should be suing you but CO2 is not the earths thermostat.
1998 2018-07-23 19:46:34 Look here bro we need a RW, it's the world's worst kept secret but I don't expect our manager to come up with options that don't make long term financial sense when we aren't funded by an oil producing country. The owners have obviously put restrictions on how much can be spent.
1999 2018-07-23 19:46:33 Jst curious... What was oil executives reaction
2000 2018-07-23 19:46:31 Not in a very distant future, oil and has will be irrelevant. Only clean water will matter, and that's not an Iranian resource. Why do you defend this awful regime in Iran? Do you live there or depend on them?
2001 2018-07-23 19:46:23 U ever tried black seed oil to help build ur iron?
2002 2018-07-23 19:46:23 I need to buy some CBD Oil!
2003 2018-07-23 19:46:18 Putin gave trump orders to go to Iran. It's about oil. Putin will get oil and trump gets real estate.

2013 2018-07-23 19:44:44 see that’s what I thought lmao, they told me I need synthetic oil and that’s why it’s that price.
2014 2018-07-23 19:44:30 where you kill people first to steal if there is natural gas and oil in your country then you are playing underground resources
2015 2018-07-23 19:44:26 "Let a righteous man strike me-- it is a kindness; let him rebuke me-- it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it" (Psalm 141:5).

Prayer for brotherly correction, and for the humility to welcome it, is essential for all Christians, but especially for Christian leaders.
2016 2018-07-23 19:44:16 Joe, that's so ageist! You should really be ashamed of yourself! Identity politics aren't helpful to minority groups, that much has been proven ever since that rat in a suit, LBJ, occupied the Oval Office bedecked in outfits of the finest bespoke oil and slime treated wool.
2017 2018-07-23 19:44:11 I know how it was broken, I also know where the oil used all over the world currently comes from.

2019 2018-07-23 19:44:02 So now it's wrong to give a woman a compliment, guess that means that women can no longer state that a man is handsome.

2023 2018-07-23 19:43:03 New crank on the trailer, fresh oil and spark plugs on the jetski. The jetski is ready for the water 
2024 2018-07-23 19:43:03 good point, we should not build any housing near san francisco or new york's numerous oil refineries
2025 2018-07-23 19:42:50 yes, that’s what they told me lol ... they said that my car needs 100% synthetic oil.
2026 2018-07-23 19:42:44 We were born when the water was still clean, played in the rain,mud. Played house with each one contributing something (mealie meal,veggies, oil,salt,spices...etc). This one grow up twerking and slaying 
2027 2018-07-23 19:42:37 I need to go get some oil I live next door to food lion they to high though
2028 2018-07-23 19:42:08 Just want to rub that fine ass down in baby oil
2029 2018-07-23 19:42:05 There are other alternatives than just cars, I use 3 of them! No rebates for transport fueled by oil or green energy, that's my position.
2030 2018-07-23 19:41:59 Cheap housing but it's near an oil refinery seems like a good trade off.
2031 2018-07-23 19:41:54 Yes nigga, bruh never gone forget D Carter kicked a nigga oil over in the strip  all I got was a “my bad” bitch my night ruined lol
2032 2018-07-23 19:41:38 Oh, yes.  An admin was promoted to the head of IT for a large division of an oil company.  She knew nothing NOTHING!  She spent all day making hardcopies of her emails and putting each sheet in its own plastic sleeve in a binder and then into cabinets with indices for all.
2033 2018-07-23 19:41:24 I forgot to mention the EEOC, a government agency that failed. Dots to connect...I wrote Senator Bayh in 2007, he stepped down in 2011 and joined the board of a USX subsidiary, Marathon Oil. John Brennan chose Bayh to handle the Feinstein allegations of illegal spying. Why Bayh?
2034 2018-07-23 19:41:24 Coby hated his fish oil vitamins & now I can just pour it in his tongue and he loves it! #ProudFurMommy
2035 2018-07-23 19:41:23 Just came back from shopping -- CBD oil and Gin, seems descriptive of our situation here in 2018.
2036 2018-07-23 19:41:06 Stop using oil from that disgusting place.  Why negotiate with these barbarians.  As Trump stood by Putin, Iran realized those two men come from Christian countries and control 2/3rd of global resources.
2037 2018-07-23 19:41:00 Do you have a newer car that needs synthetic oil? Mine is $65 lol
2038 2018-07-23 19:40:54 When you go it alone, tough sanctions stance ≠ lost Iranian oil supply
2039 2018-07-23 19:40:22 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
2040 2018-07-23 19:40:05 I have a real issue deep frying stuff, it’s a problem I really need to get over. The boiling oil just freaks me out
2041 2018-07-23 19:39:55 The idiots foolishness s extra judicial
2042 2018-07-23 19:39:29 I've worked with quite a few Commonwealth governments in my time, and nobody ever said they regretted independence.
Lucky for the Malaysians the oil was only discovered after Independence.....
2043 2018-07-23 19:39:16 It’s suppd to be based on your job. When you leave that job you can get it again and it’s easier, they don’t have to go way back to people you knew 20 or 30 yrs ago....I’m in staffing, it’s a pain if someone already isn’t working to go thru the process of reactivating.

2045 2018-07-23 19:39:12 A biz in Philippines exports coconut oil to the US..They teach local families how to make them and they buy from them and export it to the US..Someday I'll be able to replicate this in Nigeria too!

2048 2018-07-23 19:38:51 I’d rather have my hair filled with coconut oil, then have cramps 
2049 2018-07-23 19:38:43 TGOM le Peace.....it’s like Oil & Water #TheQueenMzansi
2050 2018-07-23 19:38:41 Uh, sell oil. And a lot of it.
2051 2018-07-23 19:38:34 Just tried to ID someone at work and it turns out it wasn’t even wine it was fucking olive oil am done with Waitrose
2052 2018-07-23 19:38:04 Nah, just months of use and bike oil  Adds to the flavour!
2053 2018-07-23 19:38:01 was supposed to get my oil changed like 3000 miles ago 
2054 2018-07-23 19:37:55 Without this access what makes former high level gov officials valuable assets to media orgs hiring them to pontificate on national affairs? Would they be less desirable without this inside line to government?
2055 2018-07-23 19:37:38 Would you look at that. Huh.  Not to mention they use palm oil which kills animals due to deforestation. So, “do t use plastic, it kills animals! Use a product that uses palm oil and also kills animals!”
2056 2018-07-23 19:37:38 @GRuplifter We ordered the v3 CBD Pen and love it! Do you have any information on how to change the battery or specific benefits of the CBD oil? Thank you for any information you might have!
2057 2018-07-23 19:37:22 There were people scaling castle walls in the 15th century and having boiling oil poured on them who weren’t as hot and pissed off as I’ve been today.
2058 2018-07-23 19:37:17 Snake oil cured your socialism? Lol I can only guess what that means. If they really wanted to add to the team, they would hire an Atheist or better an Antitheist- It won’t happen tho bc no one wants their beliefs challenged. Can’t leave their echo chamber inside their bubble
2059 2018-07-23 19:36:57 getting the oil change for free >
2060 2018-07-23 19:36:42 I make my own. Bag of corn, peanut oil, deep pan with lid.

2064 2018-07-23 19:36:35 Fried food is cooked with oil, oil can come from olives, olives are Mediterranean. Fried food is part of the Mediterranean diet
2065 2018-07-23 19:36:34 I put wine in my oil diffuser last night and now my whole apartment smells of Petite Syrah

2072 2018-07-23 19:35:39 Does anybody really think Gardner is pro conservation? The answer is no we don't. He is pro oil and gas period. Let his voting record speak for itself. He's a climate denier and a paid shill. 

Besides this is another lame attempt to distract from the circus in the oval office.

2075 2018-07-23 19:35:26 Ugh!! What about crushing it and putting it in coconut oil or a strong tasting food??
2076 2018-07-23 19:35:24 Without the great athletes smashing world records one after the other, Kenya would really be a basket case. Land of thieves and cheaters from the lush fields of Kiambu to the highlands of Kisii. But God never abandons his own. Gives us oil in the forgotten deserts of Turkana?
2077 2018-07-23 19:35:24 A great opportunity to apply and obtain Exploration & Production licenses for oil & gas in the African countries. Such big investments will result in a win-win situation.
2078 2018-07-23 19:35:15 Idk how dudes can fap with Vaseline. I tried it once, and let's just say I still prefer coconut oil.
2079 2018-07-23 19:34:54 It's unbelievable that there are still people who can't see what a conman and snake oil salesman this guy is.
2080 2018-07-23 19:34:52 Poison ivy. The active chemical in the plant is a clear, grease-like oil called ‘Urushiol.’

2084 2018-07-23 19:34:27 We are such babes in the woods when it comes to the corporate world & what they're allowed to get away with, such snake oil. Totally at their mercy, which they have none of.  Love you dear. We need another planet! Sad because I really like this one. Lets make them go!
2085 2018-07-23 19:34:24 vape oil. Please I must see
2086 2018-07-23 19:34:19 That was last year, am use to it, going back to 1976 hottest summer ever New Brighton baths me mother smothered us in baby oil so prepared us well, like a severe immunisation for sun stroke/burn.

2088 2018-07-23 19:34:04 I need to learn how to do an oil change by myself I’m YouTube it 
2089 2018-07-23 19:33:59 Sounds pretty good. I tend to prefer the a crusty baguette, diagonal cut slices, little cheese of your choosing   and some olive oil. Throw that in the oven for 2 or so minutes to melt the cheese.
2090 2018-07-23 19:33:53 Bearing in mind the risk in motorsports for EVERYBODY, I ask how do they manage even 'Safety'. Is it in the same way as systems developed and applied across hazardous industry. Aviation, energy, steel, oil, etc. Systemically they're about 50 years behind. IMHO of only 30yrs safet
2091 2018-07-23 19:33:52 Get tea tree oil put it before you sleep every night and it will be gone the next day 
2092 2018-07-23 19:33:52 It's beet and carrot pulp from juicing, mixed with some spices and mayo as a binder, and baked with a bit of olive oil.

Iran is a threat to oil prices. We need to make them loan Mexico the money to pay for the Wall. 

We can sell Iranian oil to Mexico cheap so we can pay for the Wall.
2096 2018-07-23 19:33:39 Unreal site that @atlasobscura .. Off to Stalin’s Underground Printing House in Tbilisi, Georgia this November before having a bath in crude oil in Baku, Azerbaijan. Could sit on the site all day, me.
2097 2018-07-23 19:33:36 @realDonaldTrump I hope your government will bring Iran's oil exports to zero by November. I hope that I will not have to repeat this again; the Treasury Department and the State Department are committed to acting on its own accord. Iran's oil should end
2098 2018-07-23 19:33:36 This may not be my best day off ever, but it's in the running. It did not start that way with a trip to the dentist for me and a doctor visit with Dolly. But then came the turn as I went to pick up my truck after an oil change where I was privileged to lead Steven to Christ! Wow!
2099 2018-07-23 19:33:26 2) she hasn't done chemo, just all the natural stuff including Phoenix Tears a.k.a Rick Simpson Oil.
2100 2018-07-23 19:33:22 I think the market is doubting Trump not on taking action against Iran but doubting he will actually eliminate Iran's oil exports because of his consistent rhetoric denouncing higher oil prices and orders to keep them much lower, even selling off the SPR reserve...
2101 2018-07-23 19:33:16 Trump increased troops? Wasn’t that on an upward trajectory since, say...Bill Clinton? Sabotaged an oil deal? So why was Rex appointed? How was Trump gonna do the oil deal after Congress voted for sanctions?
2102 2018-07-23 19:33:08 @brandless I LOVE this concept but I wish you'd clean up the skincare ingredients! corn and soybean oil, fragrance, etc...
2103 2018-07-23 19:33:05 Or they earn more, except maybe oil firm. I've had stinct in manufacturing and teleco, both cases office was the deal I swear
2104 2018-07-23 19:32:53 I don’t think you’re a whale, in fact, I think you’re graduating to “oil prince”
2105 2018-07-23 19:32:53 grab two lambs, some lavender oil, a large sword, some poppers, and a Carly Rae Jepsen album that's been soaked in moonlight for 48 hours and meet me at the Grand Canyon
2106 2018-07-23 19:32:51 Just keep spreading like oil spillage. IPOB cannot spoil his chances come 2019.

2108 2018-07-23 19:32:43 I go to @sabamotorstexas for everything. I think an oil change is $25.
2109 2018-07-23 19:32:27 lifting jugs of palm oil
2110 2018-07-23 19:32:23 Imagine a combination of wind, solar boosting the energy grid with clean renewable energy. Imagine cutting our dependency on oil with more electric and hybrid cars. Imagine the millions and millions of jobs created. Why is that not the conservatives and GOP's goal?
2111 2018-07-23 19:31:54 I think you actually care about Iran. I would find it hard to believe that the government does. I think the government cares about the oil Iran has and that's it. (I don't hear anyone talking about how bad boko haram is... because they don't have any oil)
2112 2018-07-23 19:31:53 Ooooo I hope u win the love oil 
2113 2018-07-23 19:31:42 I got an oil change this morning and when I got my car back, the radio station was switched to the Laura Ingraham show. I couldn't believe some of the shit they were saying. They're definitely brainwashing their listeners.
2114 2018-07-23 19:31:41 Palm oil
2115 2018-07-23 19:31:27 It's also important to note that the procedure to bring back Tuvok, Neelix, and the orchid was a *separation* of their DNA. Tuvix was not a mixture (flour+eggs+etc=cake) and he was an emulsion (water+oil=water/oil); Tuvix was not un-mixed, he was separated back to original forms.
2116 2018-07-23 19:31:09 So, we are still paying over 3 dollars a gallon for gasoline on the east coast. If we have such an abundant supply of oil, why is it selling at a near all time high (> $ 70 a barrel)
2117 2018-07-23 19:31:06 Aw my bd threw me 100 just for an oil change 
2118 2018-07-23 19:31:02 I tried to be boujee by getting an expensive oil to use on my face, and you know what that got me? Pimples. Fml

2124 2018-07-23 19:30:03 Yeah, I've only recently started using oil for my hair bc I started to get hair loss and I wanted to figure out if it's bc of the hair products I used, so now I'm only using a natural sensitive shampoo and oil on my hair
2125 2018-07-23 19:29:43 Vapen oil thingy who want it?

+-R20 @ PEP
2127 2018-07-23 19:29:37 Never use oil, always use grease (shortening). It makes a difference.
2128 2018-07-23 19:29:36 It’s really stiff. If you use it mix it with a softening product, conditioner or oil

2130 2018-07-23 19:29:32 No thank you...you ladies did a fantastic job and that is rarely the case with fill in hosts.
2131 2018-07-23 19:29:18 Someone change my oil for me
2132 2018-07-23 19:29:17 things i've discovered work for me specifically: oil free moisturizer, cold cream sometimes, witch hazel, washing with cool water
2133 2018-07-23 19:29:11 Bro even thou I know they are porn stars I have to choose a woman I feel I have chemistry with her work .. but I choose baby oil more lubricant. ..
2134 2018-07-23 19:29:10 Fairly cheap shampoo(3 washes) and really good/expensive conditioner. I brush it through my hair (perfect time to detangle) and leave it in till I finish my shower. Finger comb/Rinse out and then put other moisture/conditioning products in. Also try to oil scalp once a week!
2135 2018-07-23 19:29:03 1997 Scottish GVA per hr was 94.8% of uk avg. and 2015 was 98.3% all improvement by SNP, oil price low. Same period Wales down to 81% Welsh labour destroying Welsh economy.
2136 2018-07-23 19:29:01 Got a problem with Made in America?
2137 2018-07-23 19:29:00 Rachel, it’s about driving the price of oil up. Start something with Iran, they put military in the Persian gulf like the 80 s and 90 s. Oil stops flowing from Mid East, everyone buys from Russia. Price skyrockets.
2138 2018-07-23 19:28:53 The stand your ground law is if someone touches me and it scares me I can murder them.
2139 2018-07-23 19:28:48 I’m not understanding the fundamental part of trading oil idk where to get great information
2140 2018-07-23 19:28:39 Just saw a Shell oil commercial where they claim kids don't learn hard work in school.  What the actual fuck?!?!
2141 2018-07-23 19:28:30 Well it all comes down to what a reasonable person would feel in that situation and because the police won't charge him we'll never know what a jury thinks about it. Personally I feel his fear was unreasonable but I don't have all the facts and neither does anyone else.
2142 2018-07-23 19:28:17 Ben levenslang met die zaken bezig geweest, binnen chemische industrie, in buitenland oil & gas, in engineering. Hier zijn geen woorden meer voor, tart alle regels. "Laat 1000 bloemen bloeien" was er niets tegen.
2143 2018-07-23 19:28:07 Just kidding. The oil barrel is the reason why the oil retail price is high all the time.
2144 2018-07-23 19:27:59 It was the proper thing to do though if you are controlled by Putin. Putin loves having less competition for the oil that he has stolen from his people. Iran must be kept down!
2145 2018-07-23 19:27:47 I'm thinking that it might be sensible to stock up on parmesan, olive oil etc as we prepare for the paradise that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has told me is coming next March
2146 2018-07-23 19:27:33 Is it because most have attached themselves to oil and gas?
2147 2018-07-23 19:27:32 $250 later, (at least the quote they just gave me), I’m getting an oil change WITH filter, alignment, rotation, and new air filters. 
2148 2018-07-23 19:27:24 Can’t really recommend a face moisturiser cos I don’t use one any more because my skin type is bare oily. I use hylauronic acid serum in replacement of a moisturiser as it’s hydrating without any oil. But find a matte moisturiser
2149 2018-07-23 19:27:23 I share some of your concern and prefer liquid cod liver oil. However, there's some evidence that oxidation (in the body) may actually be responsible for some of its benefits.
2150 2018-07-23 19:27:05 Come on really. Wind generation may kill birds, but is that the real issue.1-2 million are killed by pesticides and 500,000 are killed by oil spills each year. Why is the idea of renewable clean energy so frightening to conservatives? Everything man does effects ecosystems.
2151 2018-07-23 19:27:03 We get tea tree oil Pal #resignedears. Just time your shake well when you’re all lathered up...
2152 2018-07-23 19:27:02 Lol we are at Jenns brothers cottage on the lake so I’m thinking the oil guys are doing alright or we’d be tenting it here!!
2153 2018-07-23 19:27:01 Please know that cookies, even dry, DO contain oils. Cookie oil w'll leave stains on your official documents.
2154 2018-07-23 19:26:58 Question is how many oil fields are left to light on fire
2155 2018-07-23 19:26:43 Since 2015 Guyana have been importing oil from Trinidad.

2160 2018-07-23 19:26:10 Again not clear. Stronger growth data could be positive for oil as it suggests higher demand. But in a risk off environment it would likely sell off. I don’t have a strong view on Oil at the moment as not only is the supply/demand picture cloudy but the background politics moreso
2161 2018-07-23 19:25:59 Adam, Amazon  and a number of other companies  should be broke up, just like Standard Oil, and Bell.

2172 2018-07-23 19:25:03 i'd agree, but only in the sense that it drove out water content. Dry grain dust explosions happen on the regular without the benefit of oil.

2175 2018-07-23 19:24:43 honestly i was afraid of moisturizer for my face for so long because i always thought it would make my skin super oily but turns out when u don't moisturize your skin gets so dry it overproduces oil to compensate which is bad!!!!!!! i'm a dumbass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2176 2018-07-23 19:24:33 Yes, but a fishy taste once a week to make sure you aren't blindly popping rancid fish oil seems like a reasonable sacrifice to make, right?
2177 2018-07-23 19:24:29 Need one for the little ones room. The heating option sounds great even though living in old houses means we have some good oil radiators in the garage for such days and a wood fire now.
2178 2018-07-23 19:24:18 It's a curse if #Nigerian govt builds & run businesses because tribalism, religiosity & nepotism is favored over merit. Can you compare #MTN, #AIRTEL, etc., to #NITEL, #NationalTheatre? No government business is afloat; #NNPC seems afloat because of oil sale

2182 2018-07-23 19:23:47 You act as though your beloved Trumpian right wing kleptocracy doesn't collect taxes. As if sucking oil out of the Earth's crust and burning it into a rich black smoke has no effect on our health or the overall well-being of our planet. Keep drinking the corporatist coolaid

2194 2018-07-23 19:22:00 With Iran it is different. The Trump, Bolton & Miller troika want regime change not negotiations. A war with Iran will inure to Russia's benefit because it will raise oil prices & distract the west from Russia's mischief. The great game is afoot.

2212 2018-07-23 19:20:01 u painted with oil, right?
2213 2018-07-23 19:19:52 Agree we learn something new all the time about our government that makes zero sense. It should be obvious to revoke it
2214 2018-07-23 19:19:47 Sure it has nothing to do with them selling oil outside the U.S. Dollar.
2215 2018-07-23 19:19:42 So is your plan to put Americans in harms way or just get the price of oil jacked up for your oil company donors, or both?

2219 2018-07-23 19:19:17 My point was? When oil prices go up, so do the price of flights, food price, a change in how people make decision in car buying. The price of oil effects a lot of things.a recession is on the course. And it will come down real hard.

Strange how experience varies

oil fields gradually produce less oil over time as they get tapped out, countries constantly need to dig new wells and rejuvenate shrinking reservoirs with injections of water or gas

2233 2018-07-23 19:17:19 I’m a state’s rights supporter but this is why the interstate commerce clause exists- to prevent a state from projecting its will onto other states. Washington state also thinks that it has the right to prevent other states oil from being shipped out of Washington. It doesn’t.
2234 2018-07-23 19:17:14 One thing that concerns me about fish oil capsules is too many people never bite them to check if they've gon rancid. They do go rancid sometimes, and if you don't bite one every few days, you'll be swallowing rancid oil without knowing it.

2260 2018-07-23 19:15:15 Maybe they will join Trump in trying to force consumers to purchase more oil and gas to support fading industries unable to compete in a new clean energy economy.

2266 2018-07-23 19:14:25 History Lesson #5: Secured generational wealth began decades ago. Having provided with companies that supply what we need. Example: oil. And are always kept within the family blood line. Most royals marry within their far descent relatives till this day.

2272 2018-07-23 19:13:30 Tories and Labour basically agree that there is another decade of austerity ahead as the UK , so why not cut out the middle man , and then have access to 100% of taxation and north sea oil instead? After all the Norway fund took but 25 years , that would mean half way there.

2280 2018-07-23 19:12:31 #saudiarabia which 15 citizens from that country killed more than 4 thousands innocent people in 11/09 but u scary people attacked wrong countries,afghanistan and iraq! Because u are hired by them and u are slave of oil money
2281 2018-07-23 19:12:26 Norway’s economy is dominated by fish and oil; Iceland’s by fish, energy and aluminium (finance no longer); Switzerland’s by finance, pharmaceuticals and food processing. All important – but not nearly as comprehensive the U.K’s economy, with its vital motor industry for example.
2282 2018-07-23 19:12:14 Under your logic, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly competed with a system in which everyone else had to compete. That’s an @AlexiLalas economic perversion.
2283 2018-07-23 19:12:12 I hear tea tree oil is good too . 
What are your questions ? I can send you his details if you want . He is the best in Lusaka actually , highly recommended. 
2284 2018-07-23 19:12:11 You can put lipstick on a pig & pearls on a hog, but, it's still a swine, "Sarah Sanders." Just like you can punish your critics now, but, history will reveal who the real traitor was & who abetted him. Seems your whole family sells snake oil to the masses. For that, #LockHerUp
2285 2018-07-23 19:12:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2286 2018-07-23 19:11:53 If someone knows where i can get banana boat the tanning oil Dm 
2287 2018-07-23 19:11:49 Those one time payments or small raises were wiped out by the impacts of rising oil prices and tariffs
2288 2018-07-23 19:11:48 Lmao whoever believed that this would happen by an anti Canadian oil    Government is seriously stupid, naive, gullible or brainwashed.
2289 2018-07-23 19:11:42 Misread that as "white lightning." In which case he was probably right.
2290 2018-07-23 19:11:38 Oil
2291 2018-07-23 19:11:33 Wonder if anyone in Trump’s circle benefited from oil futures yet? Just, you know, musin’.
2292 2018-07-23 19:11:27 Really, is that how you see it? I saw the president of Iran moving forward with middle Eastern relationships and oil deals, despite and without the US. Followed by a deranged, midnight, red-faced, fist-shaking ALL CAPS threat of annihilation by a despot.
2293 2018-07-23 19:11:24 I think the biggest swindle of all time is the US Government telling us at 18 we can die for Dick Cheney’s oil company, but you can’t drink a certain fucking liquid.
2294 2018-07-23 19:11:20 Obviously an ugly daily candle today for oil. RB has held up okay though, and after taking out yesterday's lows, I would've thought oil would've sold more. I'm neutral. I don't like it was CL and RB disagree.
2295 2018-07-23 19:11:19 バタバタしてたよ♪( 'ω' و(و "
2296 2018-07-23 19:10:57 Forever expecting them to tell me I have 800 problems with my car when I get an oil change
2297 2018-07-23 19:10:57 was this the plan? Force US into war, and after pissing off all of #NAFTA, US turns to new #bestie Vladimir Poutine for help. Together they can take control of the oil sands and try to take over the world.... HOLY SHIT @realDonaldTrump and Puitin are #PinkyandtheBrain #conspiracy
2298 2018-07-23 19:10:48 wait... you’re gonna have “Jesus 1st” in your bio but then defend and support trump? that’s like trying to mixing oil and water. the shit just don’t mix.
2299 2018-07-23 19:10:30 Yes! I’ll just cook them on the skillet no oil for you
2300 2018-07-23 19:10:25 だめぇーww

2302 2018-07-23 19:10:18 Using some rosemary+ovacoda+shea butter oil but still 
I'll try that
2303 2018-07-23 19:10:18 Tea tree oil has cleared up my skin it’s amazing
2304 2018-07-23 19:10:09 so I’m talking {complaining} ab fixing my hair (as one does) to my bf and he just looks at me in all seriousness & says 

“Idk babe have you tried putting this stuff called coconut oil in it? doesn’t that help hair?”

oh my sweet summer child...
2305 2018-07-23 19:10:08 Why does anyone not acting in official capacity,  being a private citizen need one?
2306 2018-07-23 19:10:05 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2307 2018-07-23 19:10:03 To be competitive with oil money we need to form shrewd partnerships like this indeed. Foreign experience for our own youngsters and first refusal of young talents in various leagues would be a godsend. KDB started out at Gent didn't he?
2308 2018-07-23 19:09:33 There are mediums you can use to speed up dry time like Galkyd & impasto. I sometimes use impasto but mostly I paint with oil & linseed oil. I prefer to paint without mediums. Drying time doesn’t take too long for me but I paint alla prima so I prefer it wet on wet when I can.

2310 2018-07-23 19:09:14 Is it different from the coconut oil?
2311 2018-07-23 19:09:11 Used coconut oil and one other arabian oil on my beard over the weekend and it was lit. Soft and shiny
2312 2018-07-23 19:09:04 I don't think that, Solar and renewable investment will render oil and pipelines abandoned, Ev's cars and trucks are on their way, and electric Aeroplanes are in development. all we need is more desire from the public and investment to speed it up.
2313 2018-07-23 19:08:55 haha! Yep, ladies can't resist that shit. Me included. The most popular female artists on youtube are Oil painters like Lena Danya, Lioba Bruckner, I don't think she's on YT but hugely famous Liosh all serve up elegant ladies, and they make the monies with it
2314 2018-07-23 19:08:49 Lol. Iran is Spanky's problem. Vlad gave him his orders. Need that oil price up.
2315 2018-07-23 19:08:40 Try get castor oil too..
2316 2018-07-23 19:08:04 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
2317 2018-07-23 19:08:01 Farming industry must be great. Us poor oil guys are just up here in the mud keeping the gas and oil flowing.
2318 2018-07-23 19:07:56 oil
2319 2018-07-23 19:07:51 Lmao go drink anointing oil guy 
2320 2018-07-23 19:07:46 @Elemis can’t believe what’s just happened. Brand new bottle of marine oil knocked over with the lid off, it was like slow motion watching it pour out!  I could cry!!
2321 2018-07-23 19:07:29 Is Coconut oil boy really starting Plouffe at 2nd base tonight?
2322 2018-07-23 19:07:24 It ain’t it’s easier when you put oil tho you need to@have a certain technical ability
2323 2018-07-23 19:07:24 There is a promanti brothers near Lucas oil stadium
2324 2018-07-23 19:07:15 <living bottle of olive oil
2325 2018-07-23 19:07:14 Really? I actually never had any problems with pure coconut oil before. My guess would have been that I used too much castor oil bc it's thicker and I read that you should mix it with other oils. Maybe I'll try argan oil then, thanks
2326 2018-07-23 19:07:05 I am a robot. I piss oil
2327 2018-07-23 19:07:01 Well he was in on Genie  Oil with Rothschild and Cheney. In Golan Heights
2328 2018-07-23 19:06:46 It's kinda like spray able oil
2329 2018-07-23 19:06:45 Obama was a mass murderer who invaded Libya for the oil and gold. Obama deceived everyone! He was the worst ever.
2330 2018-07-23 19:06:41 @JNJNews Hi what is the percentage of oil and wax in your kiwi polish?
2331 2018-07-23 19:06:41 My cousin was the FBI person in charge.....she said they didn't find any remains larger than your thumb....terrible.....
2332 2018-07-23 19:06:21 I think the fact that they had that military patch made up is their "jump the shark" moment. The delusion that $TSLA shorts have somehow transformed themselves into "heros" hides the fact they are simply oil mercenaries.
2333 2018-07-23 19:05:58 Never get your oil done at kwik lube in Oskaloosa..
2334 2018-07-23 19:05:50 To benefit from marijuana's medicinal properties, it should be used as THC oil or taken in it's raw form with tea or juice. Not set to fire. Smoke of any kind is harmful to the body
2335 2018-07-23 19:05:49 A Trump promise? Ok let me go short oil.
2336 2018-07-23 19:05:46 Bless his heart. Unfortunate, the home town pressure these kids have to face sometimes. He and LSU’s offense go together about as good as oil and water. I imagine once LSU tanks this season that he opens things back up.
2337 2018-07-23 19:05:45 oil.... oil..... oiL..... oIL...... OIL...... OIL.... OOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL...... OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2338 2018-07-23 19:05:29 Tea tree oil ,they hate it. Clears up any bites quickly too.
2339 2018-07-23 19:05:27 People seeing the funny side of Donald Trump and a possible conflict with Iran. You won’t be laughing when Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz (where most of the worlds oil comes from) and your petrol will cost £10 a litre 
2340 2018-07-23 19:05:25 This is so me. I would rather not look like I have an oil slick on my head, so I wash my hair daily.
2341 2018-07-23 19:05:23 Dollar gained a bit , trump war of words on iran escalating could Lead oil higher .
2342 2018-07-23 19:05:22 Rump's to do list from putin
1. Allow takeover of montenegro 
2. Oil embargo on Iran
3. Buy more russian oil 
4. Exempt russian companies from tariffs
2343 2018-07-23 19:05:04 My favorite part of getting an oil change is the complimentary mansplaining. #girlproblems
2344 2018-07-23 19:05:02 We're thrilled to hear that you love the Honest Beauty facial oil, Jan! Thanks for sharing your kind feedback with us!
2345 2018-07-23 19:04:59 You guys are really from America we out here use oil or butter for some people but we literally use oil on my side where I live we don’t have spray y’all are living easier
2346 2018-07-23 19:04:58 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime
2347 2018-07-23 19:04:51 do you add any kind of oil, or just fruits, sugar, and water?
2348 2018-07-23 19:04:44 i see. that isn’t a thing in my country. we just use butter or oil
2349 2018-07-23 19:04:31 Going forward everyone at whatever level should be stripped. If they return, a fresh review is done.
2350 2018-07-23 19:04:14 Castor oil ..
2351 2018-07-23 19:04:10 This war won’t take place at least in the near future. USA already sells weapons worth of billions to the gulf nations on yearly basis to defend themselves from the Persian state, however it doesn’t want a surge in the oil prices
2352 2018-07-23 19:04:05 Coconut oil and lavender rub
2353 2018-07-23 19:04:04 Used olive oil in my hair today, feeling Greek as shit, going to throw some marble at a riot cop, going to get a gold chain tangled in my chest hair, going to get shot with an arrow and bleed out on the shores of Troy, hell yes
2354 2018-07-23 19:04:02 Russia uses its oil exports to punish its neighbors, even EU countries like Germany, by limiting gas flows in Winter to countries that displease it. Ukraine was incredibly vulnerable to this until 2015.

Plus, the majority of modern Russia was conquered by Moscow later than 1600.
2355 2018-07-23 19:03:58 ela vem acompanhando o oil melhor que a PETR4 ? (viu o post sobre ela, na sexta-feira ?)
2356 2018-07-23 19:03:33 Hi, coconut oil does wonders for hair growth. Where are you based ma?
2357 2018-07-23 19:03:23 Literally: to sell oil
2358 2018-07-23 19:03:22 It's just burning a little oil.
2359 2018-07-23 19:03:18 Lmaooo, aswear. It's coconut oil 
2360 2018-07-23 19:03:10 it was so good! we used really good olive oil and fresh basil and now store bought pesto will never be able to comepete lol
2361 2018-07-23 19:03:06 Everyone reading this post knows what @JustinTrudeau , @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg said...their statements are frequently repeated and easily Googled for verification. Getting it to tide water where it can achieve world prices means the same, shipping oil to Asia! #cdnpoli
2362 2018-07-23 19:03:03 I'm trying to get on a holistic self care what what routine. Been reading up on tea tree and coconut oil more. Is a dermatologist actually present, I have questions.
2363 2018-07-23 19:02:57 i don’t think I put enough oil in the banana bread and i am very scared
2364 2018-07-23 19:02:38 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2365 2018-07-23 19:02:33 Russia controls the banking sector, the oil and gas sector and the utility sector.
2366 2018-07-23 19:02:33 I've been using CBD oil for about 3 weeks. I started it to see if it would help with my RA and MS, but found an added bonus along the way - stress relief!  It's been a crazy year and I didn't realize how chronically stressed I was until it was GONE.
2367 2018-07-23 19:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2368 2018-07-23 19:02:30 Does beard oil protect against chlorine?
2369 2018-07-23 19:02:27 He remember me the jerk who stole ladies's bags in the street, last day."You give me your oil or i will punish you!"
2370 2018-07-23 19:02:21 If there’s Parmesan, olive oil, anchovies or black olives in any of those recipes that she likes to cook so much, I condemn her to a life of warm cheese sandwiches on sweaty white bread. With margarine.
2371 2018-07-23 19:02:21 Shea Butter cream, hair growth oil 
2372 2018-07-23 19:02:19 I managed to transition off of opioid painkillers with Rick Simpson Oil or Cannabis Oil. It was not as dramatic as a painkiller, but it alleviated my pain (Lyme Disease Stage 4) and returned me to a better way of life.
2373 2018-07-23 19:02:14 I'm listening to Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning.
2374 2018-07-23 19:02:13 Tanks aren’t heated. Fuel passes through a fuel oil heat exchanger where the oil heats the fuel.
2375 2018-07-23 19:02:13 I think their plan is to use Alberta's wealth to fund their green dreams by sending oil to China via Kinder

2386 2018-07-23 19:00:07 It’s kinda fucked up that the US government went to war in the Middle East for oil and came back with opium
2387 2018-07-23 19:00:07 The U.S a country which is labeled by many as a free country should stop you from doing whatever you want. My people , yea people in Iran, are suffering from what you say. We shouldn’t be under pressure because you want to have free oil and sell guns. IT IS NOT FAIR.
2388 2018-07-23 19:00:07 If women start producing oil in their uteri, it's gonna make the GOP nuts.

2395 2018-07-23 18:59:38 Is the obligatory stereotypical Texas oil tycoon billionaire character trope just what happens when the obligatory stereotypical old western prospector character trope finally finds gold in them thar hills? All of these questions and more are what keep up late at night. #StayWoke
2396 2018-07-23 18:59:36 Its Putins strategy. He wants Irans oil.
2397 2018-07-23 18:59:28 When is this supposed to be completed, I hear you are currently exporting crude oil????
2398 2018-07-23 18:59:20 I work in banking and I don’t see any evidence of a boom besides some new oil and coal jobs

Most  goes corporations who are keeping stock market up by buying their own stock.

I think the black and hispanic “fewest job applicatioNs” are related to deportation and incarcaration.
2399 2018-07-23 18:59:19 *random kid approaches me while I’m waiting on oil change*

Me: well I’m 22 
Kid: do u have a mom
Me: yes 
Kid: so you’re a kid 


2400 2018-07-23 18:58:44 Have you been listening to Alice Isn't Dead?  The invisible oil derricks made an appearance in the live show...  @AlicePodcast
2401 2018-07-23 18:58:43 I mean ALA is technically abundant in vegetable oil, but i know you mean the commonly added, often-oxidized stuff, which is fair.
2402 2018-07-23 18:58:27 This is just awful! Avoid Palm oil people! I know it won’t solve the problem but it may help! These animals deserve better than this and not to be locked up on a zoo either!
2403 2018-07-23 18:58:19 This moisturising shower gel with baby oil is great. If you like being found naked in two inches of water with head injuries.
2404 2018-07-23 18:58:15 Wow coconut oil has really cleared up my skin 
2405 2018-07-23 18:58:14 They are still pushing there is a center civilization on the middle of the earth. Even being flat. At the Gulf of Mexico. Oil is down 1,200 feet. It has to be hot to be made and move. At the Gulf. Same as gas at level. Magma directly underneath. Proven.
2406 2018-07-23 18:58:12 This administration will rape the enviroment during their term & leave it a hollow shell. If they found oil under Yosemitie or diamond reserves in Monument Park you can bet drumpf would sign them over to private investors faster than you can say "endangered species".
2407 2018-07-23 18:58:08 I bought an oil diffuser too. My room smellin like grapefruit and lemongrass. 

So soothing.
2408 2018-07-23 18:58:07 Why would Trump unleash a Twitter storm against Iran? Well, Carter Page was asked to broker the sale of 19% of Rosneft in exchange for lifting of Russian sanctions. Who owns that 19%? Maybe Putin told Trump to sew instability in the markets. Instability is good for oil prices.
2409 2018-07-23 18:58:04 My concern is that Scotland is in this position, despite 30 yrs of oil revenue BECAUSE of UK mismanagement, while we look across the North Sea at a country with a similar population and resources with £1 trillion in the bank.
2410 2018-07-23 18:58:00 I can't go to the hotel kitchen and ask for yoghurt and don't have aloe vera...

2412 2018-07-23 18:57:51 Three tenets of a good omelette: 1. Don’t over mix.  2. Keep your heat medium-low. 3. Use a bit more oil/butter than you usually would. #LowandSlow
2413 2018-07-23 18:57:46 Does he think it’s the Oil Filters???
2414 2018-07-23 18:57:40 I tried it a few years ago and where its at makes it difficult for creams. Its on my upper neck/hairline area. Castor oil promotes hair growth too so it should be cool.
2415 2018-07-23 18:57:22 both sides playing each other front of the world to look bigger.   Unless real war starts this just a bad show

2417 2018-07-23 18:57:17 Please be careful what you wish for, this guy wouldn't think twice about bringing war and famine to your country, while stealing you oil and setting you up with the bankers
2418 2018-07-23 18:57:16 THIS is how you pick your pundits and various talking heads? This explains so much. Fox News is a misnomer. Your show is snake oil aka poison to democracy. For shame.
2419 2018-07-23 18:57:11 I got my oil changed last week. My coolant was topped off... it's now ALL GONE... any guesses? Going to my mechanic now
2420 2018-07-23 18:57:06 Money. Many of the endangered species fall in land with oil, or precious metal reserves. If the endangered label is removed, the land becomes available.
2421 2018-07-23 18:56:56 Iran is a dictatorship trying to manipulate the world with their oil supply. Trump slapped them with sanctions to protect our country and our economy. THAT, my friend, is self defense. Think about getting on the Trump train. There is room for you too! #MAGA #KAG

2423 2018-07-23 18:56:31 I got pears oil to add to my cream to make it a bit oily.
I use just the oil when I’m feeling like a baby girl.
And the best part isn’t the powder i rub on my neck after but the coverall Pjs.

2436 2018-07-23 18:54:58 Ah I love my car shop. Told me i had 50% pads left on my brakes. Took my car elsewhere for my last oil change and they told me 5% and it would cost $500. Eat. A. Dick.

2438 2018-07-23 18:54:33 The proposed projects for the construction of crude oil pipelines will be from Republic of Niger to Nigeria including the establishment of new refinery at a border town in Nigeria and it is envisaged to be wholly private sector financed. #7BigWins
2439 2018-07-23 18:54:27 Yes, and North Korea doesn't sit astride the Straits of Hormuz. Sink a couple of large ships there and probably at least slow the flow of oil. Probably more impact than Saddam's Kuwaiti oil well fires.
2440 2018-07-23 18:54:20 It's got palm oil but that's it
2441 2018-07-23 18:54:06 Yes, anonymous account, we continue to arm the Ukraine, have economic sanctions and even upbraided Germany over doing business with Russia on oil and gas.  By the way, come up with a funny meme.  That was stupid.
2442 2018-07-23 18:54:06 In Benue we, d tiv pple eat stew with virtually every swallow. But ours is just pepper made with locust beans and red oil, some pple put a bit of tomato too tho.
2443 2018-07-23 18:54:01 Except that 9/11 was not the cause for the invasion of Iraq, just the pretext. Or in Aristotelian terms: material cause was neocon ideology; formal cause was all the events between points 1-4; efficient cause was a petro-president's stupidity; final cause was geopolitics of oil.
2444 2018-07-23 18:53:56 please what oil or cream can one recommend for hair growth?
2445 2018-07-23 18:53:52 What Collin said. Or sauteed with garlic, olive oil & some salt. Grilled on a sandwich with tomato, pesto, mozz (or goat cheese) and olive oil. Or... sauteed/grilled tossed with pasta & a red sauce. Or.. pasta and pesto. Really, every dish. :)

2448 2018-07-23 18:53:32 Thanks to big oil...
2449 2018-07-23 18:53:31 I hate getting oil changes dawg, these niggas talk you to death

2452 2018-07-23 18:53:20 I mean, they were soaked in oil too, so I feel like that's an important contributing factor
2453 2018-07-23 18:53:18 Also, as oil prices rise, so do the illegal profits Putin skims off the top of the Russian oil sales. #basiccorruption
2454 2018-07-23 18:53:11 Clearly what is needed is open borders. Just increase our population by 40% and everything will be fine. The only problem, no oil, food or water.
2455 2018-07-23 18:53:05 Olive oil....
2456 2018-07-23 18:53:04 The economy is getting worse every day. The 10 year is up 7 points today. Meat prices, & all other food items are soaring, housing has been declining because of high pries for three months in a row, & oil is continuing to rise. All of these factors indicate another recession.
2457 2018-07-23 18:53:01 my food was drowned in oil and now i'm sick :(
2458 2018-07-23 18:52:58 I remember it well. I was 10 and 3/4 and exploring round my hometown of Bournemouth beaches, parks and all surrounds on my bike with my mates  & only told to come home when it got dark. The nearest thing to suntan lotion at the time was olive oil so I was like #greasedlightning
2459 2018-07-23 18:52:43 Then the US and UK probably shouldn't have undermined the democratic Mosaddegh regime in 1953 and installed the Shah, screwing an entire nation over just to maintain control of oil supplies. But sorry that things have become so tiresome for you.
2460 2018-07-23 18:52:16 ねぽや〜
2461 2018-07-23 18:52:04 Oil? Who said something about oil, bitch you cookin?
2462 2018-07-23 18:51:57 Yes he is talking about the exact same terrorist Regime that brought down Mossadegh via CIA and MI6 and installed the Savak via Mossad to ensure the 25 year Deal about the Oil from Abadan
2463 2018-07-23 18:51:41 I did no such thing. The oil was at fault. You wanted popcorn!!!
2464 2018-07-23 18:51:31 They are ramping up their social presence ..Trump must be in trouble and they know it. Now Iran..next we will be getting oil from Russia.
2465 2018-07-23 18:51:08 And look at all that oil, and the only land access between Africa and all of the Middle East and Eurasia. What could possibly go wrong?
2466 2018-07-23 18:50:58 Anyone ever tried grapeseed or tea tree oil?
2467 2018-07-23 18:50:40 Be careful with them. My friends car caught on fire after an oil change with them.
2468 2018-07-23 18:50:33 I meant Texas may be producing more than Iraq and Iran but if you compare proven reserves than it's nothing
2469 2018-07-23 18:50:00 Great. A gov that thinks the oil and gas industry is killing Mother Earth is now on charge of an oil pipeline. 

Won’t be surprised to hear that it’s losing money (taxpayer dollars)
2470 2018-07-23 18:49:59 Love watching the way bergamot oil just seeps into the tea.
2471 2018-07-23 18:49:55 he'll put the majority of the world on the unemployment line with this plan of distraction and a hot war. $400/barrel oil is a possibility if the Gulf is closed and Saudi Arabia's fields and pipelines are destroyed. No one goes to work, stores empty and collapse follows.
2472 2018-07-23 18:49:53 Just went to @Walmart #02038 and got a high mileage oil change. They returned my car with grease on the passenger seat and the car wasn't even vacuumed. Awesome experience. Totally worth the money.
2473 2018-07-23 18:49:48 Why would you put baby oil gel in an infant’s hair?
2474 2018-07-23 18:49:46 U.S. oil prices give up earlier gains to settle with a loss
2475 2018-07-23 18:49:45 Everything that is going on in Muslim countries today was going on in Christian countries at one time. The difference is outside intervention and the exploitation of oil. Oil is what has cursed the Mid East. Without it you would no more care about it then you care about Africa.
2476 2018-07-23 18:49:39 Maybe you should denounce our president for his people running the epa? First we had a big oil person running it, now we have a coal lobbyist in charge. How do those two run something on the opposite spectrum of their precious careers? Hold @realDonaldTrump accountable.
2477 2018-07-23 18:49:36 @FoxBusiness Are you guys ever going to fix the darn OIL ticker on the bottom of the screen. Or is nobody even looking for quality control???
The Oil (CL) ticker has been broke and stuck, since Varney started this morning.

2480 2018-07-23 18:49:19 I bought a hot oil treatment for my hair and I can’t wait to go home and do it 
2481 2018-07-23 18:49:10 Years ago I read that California is the 5th largest economy in the world. People need something to relate to. The growth in Texas is solid, especially once there’s more pipeline bandwidth for it.
2482 2018-07-23 18:49:09 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
2483 2018-07-23 18:49:08 Several oil and gas exporters have displayed serious, even concrete (Iran, UAE), interest in building new nuclear power stations in order to free up more oil and gas for export.

More lucrative than burning it in domestic electricity production
2484 2018-07-23 18:49:06 Saw a few cars broken down on the motorway today. Made me ask. Do you check your oil, water and tyre pressure on a regular basis?
2485 2018-07-23 18:49:06 The next three months is going to be the most destabilizing period for the regime in perhaps the last 39 years. Oil exports will drastically decrease as the water crisis worsens & Iranians increasingly challenge the regime.
2486 2018-07-23 18:49:05 This favours his servants Saudi, so they are happy with news.Again the use of oil as a weapon for wealth fuels the debate. Us want India stop buy oil from Iran too. India do as Us wants. This hurts Iran &what happens to oil price -goes up. India was told a lie, oil price no rise
2487 2018-07-23 18:48:43 IF it's true that Oil Wells was among offers to some aggrieved r APC members  not to defect to other Party,  it means the fight against Corruption is a Political hog wash. 
And a Sufficient reason to say we are doomed.
2488 2018-07-23 18:48:35 I would never classify their actions as any overhaul. It's an act to reverse all protections for endangered species, animals etc., wasting time effort and costs and setting-back the stage of achievements. All in an attempt to lease or sell protected Federal lands for oil drilling
2489 2018-07-23 18:48:31 Vegetable oil
2490 2018-07-23 18:48:21 Ya , it works in small european nations with small populations that are primarily financed by their offshore oil operations. Stop that flow of money and free stuff stops functioning. What works in a population of 16 to 65 million people hasnt a chance of working for 340 million.
2491 2018-07-23 18:48:21 How do we get big business and oil companies to stop producing so much food? While there’s people starving on our soil.

2507 2018-07-23 18:45:34 I’ve misplaced my Abundance oil...
2508 2018-07-23 18:45:20 @realDonaldTrump cares about making money for himself and oil companies. He doesn’t see us as people.
2509 2018-07-23 18:45:19 Here's the thing...roux is oil and flour. OIL AND FLOUR. I don't know how you'd get bougie about that.
2510 2018-07-23 18:45:06 Iran had a democratically elected government that was overthrown (again due to oil) and the corrupt, brutal Shah was installed. These countries have never been allowed the time, space and freedom to evolve to independent, democratic societies like the oceans allowed the US to do.
2511 2018-07-23 18:44:50 There was no more threat. One of the biggest rules of CHL is do not go looking to start shit with people. This guy was well known for starting shit with people. Probably because carrying the gun makes him feel hard.
2512 2018-07-23 18:44:47 I've heard that there might have been oil on track where Vettel skidded off, Sirotkin reputed to have hit the oil too. Do you know more? Also, the endplate from Vettel's front wing, could it have contributed to the mistake?
2513 2018-07-23 18:44:39 I get to oil wrestle with a woman in the next couple weeks. I can’t freakin wait! Just have to arrange our schedules. 
2514 2018-07-23 18:44:29 Anas I agree, US is not going to blockade Iranian oil tankers, but what’s your estimate for barrels to remain on market?
2515 2018-07-23 18:44:23 trump still doing Putin's bidding... WAR with Iran will only favor Russia ....with increased Oil prices Russia will fill their coffers... few really know how Russia suffered under low oil prices ....& the Iran deal would've help keep it low.  ONLY LOSS WILL BE AMERICAN LIVES

2517 2018-07-23 18:44:11 Yep, the oil, gas, & mining companies all line the pockets of the GOP. It’s all greed, nothing else. Trump & the GOP are going to cause irreparable damage if they are not stoped.

2530 2018-07-23 18:43:22 Bought black seed oil because it’s supposed to work wonders and my skin needs it 
2531 2018-07-23 18:43:21 I bought a wee popcorn maker (about £15). Parmesan and rosemary popcorn is lush (also add a wee bit truffle oil when feeling decadent).

2535 2018-07-23 18:42:44 I like wings and drums.

I use a yogurt based marinade w/sea salt, turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic, and a dash of ginger. I let them marinade overnight.

Then I bake the wings and then pan-fry them in either grass-fed butter or coconut oil. It is delicious.
2536 2018-07-23 18:42:43 I put a tea tree oil face mask on and the breeze from my balcony door is making the fumes from the mask go into my eyes and it huuurts
2537 2018-07-23 18:42:37 The Mid East has a combination of things going on centered around oil & religion. The oil motivates outside forces to intervene and prop up authoritarian regimes to oppress and exploit the people. The suffering people turn to religion for solace from the oppression and suffering.

2560 2018-07-23 18:40:05 Life is like a lamp flame. It needs a little oil now and then.
2561 2018-07-23 18:40:03 If anyone sees me in Lidl I have coconut oil in my hair ok it’s not grease it’s coconut oil. There’s grease under the coconut oil but that’s beside the point

2563 2018-07-23 18:39:43 What was the rest of the field results? The yield looks ok, but was the oil content and £ value?

*Tax bill drastically reduces my property tax deduction,
*Reduction of said deduction has reduced value of my home by 25%,
*Iran rhetoric causing oil prices to rise will cost more to heat my house

2571 2018-07-23 18:39:04 Is the fat in whole cream in coffee enough fat for the fish oil to be absorbed? I take them twice a day but two capsules in the morning when I'm fasting except for that cream.
2572 2018-07-23 18:38:51 I have a Mega Lucario keychain on my car keys and, as the technician gave my car keys back after my oil change, he said I had a “fierce little fella” on my keys

2579 2018-07-23 18:38:14 Why not? They cover oil news all the time.
2580 2018-07-23 18:38:12 You promised Putin that you would place Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as SOS so he can lift sanctions & Putin can start drilling in the Arctic.
Rosneft/Tillerson/Putin/Trump, OIL BARONS.
2581 2018-07-23 18:37:58 Was I ever! We did Goldilocks and all the porridge was made with coconut flour, coconut oil, coconut flakes & coconut cream.

2583 2018-07-23 18:37:57 When the shale boom began grow, oil producers started lobbying to govt. hard for it because they had to sell to domestic refines at a discount who then turned around and sold fuel full price on the international market, fuel exports were not banned
2584 2018-07-23 18:37:48 No lil table? No extra layer of cardboard underneath to soak up the grease and oil? DansGame is this even a pizza!?
2585 2018-07-23 18:37:32 make sure to wear a wig cap so your hair doesn’t break off and apply olive oil or coconut oil to keep your hair moisturized.
2586 2018-07-23 18:37:31 If I’m ever in the mood to get treated like a piece of dumb blonde garbage, I just go get my oil changed and talk to the guys that work there 
2587 2018-07-23 18:37:21 You've got so much "oil" til you done slid right out of God's will 
2588 2018-07-23 18:37:19 should i order this deciem b oil? or stick with rosehip. i’ve become a human testing machine 
2589 2018-07-23 18:37:19 Africa gets darker with every discovered oil field.
2590 2018-07-23 18:37:16 Crazy rich Asians getting an oil change in their Porsche next to me be acting surprised when they’re told their engine is 50 miles from dying because they’ve never had an oil change.
2591 2018-07-23 18:37:09 4)  If oil wealth drops, it's an open question whether solidarity will break down further in the future, or whether the country will return to a more state-directed economy. Meanwhile, a large union sector (socialist?) keeps wage differences compressed.

2596 2018-07-23 18:36:56 The next big war will be between Israel and Iran. Saudi Arabia will be on Israel's side and America will support Israel depending on how many forces President Trump wants to commit to the effort to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Oil is the biggest motivator for the war.

2604 2018-07-23 18:35:59 Just cut in half, sauté in olive oil and garlic, some red pepper flakes, add salt and you’re going to love them
2605 2018-07-23 18:35:58 So i used a peel of face mask and it hurt so bad to take off so i shaved all those baby hairs off and put baby oil under my mask it comes off so easily ~Ti
2606 2018-07-23 18:35:50 I don’t know how you become so cynical or misinformed that you think this is a good idea. You can save more money by ending tax breaks for those wildly profitable oil companies.
2607 2018-07-23 18:35:49 How do you look into the background and seek search warrant on someone you dont know who they are? Odd.

2610 2018-07-23 18:35:32 What do you say to the argument that Russia could benefit from increased oil prices, Iranian ‘alliance’ notwithstanding ?
2611 2018-07-23 18:35:31 Then you show a level of tolerance and introspection we could all benefit from. Unfortunately this guy is paid to fan the flames of discord and to try to be as incendiary as possible for clicks. There is no honor in this tactic anymore than snake oil salesmen
2612 2018-07-23 18:35:26 Oil and water mannn... not a good combo
2613 2018-07-23 18:35:16 only real samson stans will remember when i worked in the olive oil store
2614 2018-07-23 18:35:11 Vacation was a success. First indication VanVan oil is working away was obliterating my family at dice games. But catching all 3 flights home after an O'Hare delay was insanely impressive. Only a bit of light jogging needed.
2615 2018-07-23 18:34:59 Hello everyone! If any of you are interested in hot/cold rice bags HMU! I make and sell them and infuse them with your fav essential oil in whatever fabric you like! Help us both out and get one!
2616 2018-07-23 18:34:56 I tried using grass fed butter and coconut oil. and I’ve also heard people use a mushroom coffee blend
2617 2018-07-23 18:34:55 Am I the only person in the world who dips their sandwiches in olive oil?
2618 2018-07-23 18:34:41 With Bruce, we all need to remember two things (excluding him losing both parents at business end of season) 1. He turned the oil tanker heading south back around that five managers before failed to 2. Twitter is always anti-Bruce but when at VP very different story @villareport
2619 2018-07-23 18:34:40 A) The imaginary world that lives in your head bears no resemblance to the real one. B) Commodities (oil) and manufacturing are the most valuable things in the world. C) Everyone works very hard, even drug addicts (of which there are few). Only a few old ppl on SS.
2620 2018-07-23 18:34:36 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2621 2018-07-23 18:34:31 3) This attitude towards public ownership is definitely based on socialist ideas. The bourgeois parties when in power regularly try to privatize state assets. They have been more or less successful. With oil has come considerable wealth.
2622 2018-07-23 18:34:26 Also more garlic, never enough garlic on a pizza in the UK. Mix raw garlic paste into the tomato base, or drizzle on garlic oil.
2623 2018-07-23 18:34:17 Would "natural nut oil" be better for you?

2633 2018-07-23 18:33:03 Oil market-wise, shortage of a military blockade or decleritation of war, I cannot see a complete halt of Iranian oil exports.
2634 2018-07-23 18:33:01 Cooking oil not spared either
2635 2018-07-23 18:32:52 Got burnt at sand castle yesterday. The perks of having fair skin. But don’t worry baby cuz I put on his bomb ass coconut oil that moisturizes my skin so I don’t peel & turns my burn into a tan unlike aloe that makes me peel & completely takes the burn away & leaves ZERO tan

2643 2018-07-23 18:31:25 Russia is the only one serious about de-dollarization. The Yuan oil contract was probably pushed by Russia. Xi is buying USD as we speak. If Obama got a 3rd term, Iran would probably be buying UST with their oil $ by now.

- A BUG FLEW INTO MY EAR
- choked on some water and it came out my nose
- got some kind of oil(?) on my foot and stained the sofa
- COOKED A WASP IN OUR DINNER AND TIM NEARLY ATE IT

2655 2018-07-23 18:30:06 worst thing about being vegetarian: having to take fish oil and iron supplements
2656 2018-07-23 18:29:53 Do you have a link to that study? I've seen previous studies with similar results. But 90% of the subsidy has to do with tax treatments and aren't really subsidies but realistic ways of taxing oil field depletion.
2657 2018-07-23 18:29:43 I've gotten far in life and business. I have not tried politics, but that may be a future possibility. However, I don need to screw over the next person to be financially happy. If I make a promise, I will keep it. Trump is a snake oil dealer and always has been.
2658 2018-07-23 18:29:20 Ha! We had a basset-beagle mix that once ate a large bottle of fish oil capsules. To our amazement, he didn't seem to get sick from it.
2659 2018-07-23 18:29:06 It is the same bill. There are not more than one carbon tax bills at play. The discussion has not been transparent about what a "liability waiver" and "regulatory simplification" really mean for giving Big Oil a route to continue extracting and burning fossil fuels. #ExxonKnew
2660 2018-07-23 18:28:39 *I felt the bed move and woke up but didn't move. I was still in that half wake/half sleep state when I heard the bathroom door squeak. Fuck I needed to oil that. Wait! Who...? Oh, I sighed remembering I had the little minx in my bed last night. Fuck she had been<
2661 2018-07-23 18:28:34 OK Instant Pot still smells like plastic when hot. Gonna go one more steam and see if that fixes it.

I wish I remembered what hot oil smells like. It could just be the oil this time because it's a different smell. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2663 2018-07-23 18:28:12 That picture looks like a coverage issue...  up gallons and switch up nozzles maybe.  Our weeds are smaller in size and mainly of the pig variety, but we’ve been just running 32 oz of 3sl with either NIS or crop oil and getting everything I “think”.
2664 2018-07-23 18:27:47 hmm maybe use beard oil, or creams then to help *shrug*
as for how i found it, it was on my feed and i just....commented cuz not many guys think about washing a beard and conditioning it tbh

2666 2018-07-23 18:27:34 I think more petrodollar priced oil goes out there. Global suppliers minus arab states is less favorable to USD.

"Holy" was a english way to say "sacred", which is a Latin word for secret, or seperate.
The scriptures, oil lamps, Latin mass, etc in the church were kept secret or seperate from common folks.

2694 2018-07-23 18:24:33 Also I've never heard anyone call lube "sex toy oil". Ever.

2696 2018-07-23 18:24:26 I used to have a great app for my phone that let you scan barcodes to check for palm oil. I just read the labels now though. I have to check for soy and nuts too now.
2697 2018-07-23 18:24:19 Well...look at her..you can see why she said it
2698 2018-07-23 18:24:05 Thanks big oil and natural gas for creating thousands upon thousands of jobs in PA.
2699 2018-07-23 18:23:51 That article is one blue sky perspective. 
Ed system has leaned left forever, you’d have to acknowledge that. 

Lately the far left will push for devastatingly bad ideas like ‘equality of outcome’ and ‘intersectionality’ to be pushed. Questioning the process is essential.
2700 2018-07-23 18:23:33 The oil is amazing. I bought my sign from him months ago, I wear it everyday.
2701 2018-07-23 18:23:21 Oil .... Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
2702 2018-07-23 18:23:12  well, it called “coconut oil”...
2703 2018-07-23 18:23:12 OIL & GAS companies, through the US government,  will MAKE the US dependent....1000s of scientists have proven this wrong.
2704 2018-07-23 18:23:00 Glad you were able to find something! I've raised interest in seeing a wider choice of palm oil free biscuits for internal review. Gordo

2709 2018-07-23 18:22:34 what is the price of crude oil between 2011 and 2015?
2710 2018-07-23 18:22:26 Behind all the doors of the enormous  BEAURACRY APPARATUS  money drips down HIS pockets OPS'OIL
2711 2018-07-23 18:22:21 I don't care about you, Koko, Zuma or Ramaphosa. I find what you are saying ridiculous and illogical. Oil prices are manipulated daily and we add levies that other countries don't have. That's why fuel is cheaper in Botswana, supplied by South Africa.
2712 2018-07-23 18:22:17 @realDonaldTrump NOW THE KING TOLD HIS BOOGIE MAN
YOU HAVE TO LET THAT RAGA DROP THE OIL DOWN THE DESERT WAY HAS BEEN SHAKIN TO THE TOP THE KING DROVE HIS CADILLAC HE WENT CRUISING DOWN THE GRILLE THE MUEZZIN WAS STANDING ON THE RADIATOR GRILLE

2716 2018-07-23 18:21:45 Um, I'm pretty sure when he said "sex toy oil" he means lube.
2717 2018-07-23 18:21:43 She sells hair oil?
Seriously?
2718 2018-07-23 18:21:41 So. If you knew somebody really sexy was going to come over and rub you all over with oil it would be shit if you forgot to pack your ladyshaver wouldn't it?
2719 2018-07-23 18:21:40 U seem much better at your job than @ScottPruittOK: both of you are greedy, science deniers that have been purchased by big oil/gas/chem/coal, but #Pruitt kept us environment lovers engaged against his grift. U keep your planet killing on the business as usual down low. 
2720 2018-07-23 18:21:37 I was on the fence. This article sealed it for me. I saw first hand what the sugar industry is doing (all the dead fish etc) I am an organic grower and an advocate against the worst environmental disaster in history. (Gulf oil spill) I'm a photographer that got sick...
2721 2018-07-23 18:21:08 We were supposed to run out of “fossil fuels” before 2000 per the Snake Oil salesmen and we see how that turned out
2722 2018-07-23 18:20:59 @Samir_Madani I wasn't expecting this from CNN
2723 2018-07-23 18:20:58 I had a salad for lunch it was cool. All up on my mind was some wings and scallops fried hard in oil that’s been used 60 times already. Whew Chile the ghettttoooooo 
2724 2018-07-23 18:20:41 Bernie’s past has never been closely examined by the media. How many know he didn’t bother voting until he was 39? That he lived in and got kicked out of a commune? That he used to advocate nationalizing several major industries like oil. He is a propped up tool to divide Dems.

Brain: here's a new idea about the gay daughter of an oil baron trying to thwart her father's business expansion plans in revenge for forcing her into an arranged marriage
2726 2018-07-23 18:20:07 Girl hellllyeah fuck all that. Use castor/coconut oil mixture for about 2-3 weeks and then find a really good mascuuuura and you’ll be back right again!
2727 2018-07-23 18:20:01 Yes, but so what? There's an uncouth semi-literate mob thug with a talent as a snake oil salesman installed in the White House. Everybody knows that already. But he's there. Russia played a big part in the Brexit referendum too.
2728 2018-07-23 18:19:50 Today @makaangola published 2 important articles that underscore the scale of corruption in #Angola by the ex-president's kids & their associates. Numbers involved are mind-boggling. Next time someone tells you our econ crisis is due to low oil prices, just hit 'em with the facts
2729 2018-07-23 18:19:49 Mais même le castor oil il plaque pas bien
2730 2018-07-23 18:19:42 OPEC uses price to destroy infrastructure for exploration, fracking, solar installation... we don’t need “lower prices” from Iran. We need to #TaxImportedOil to protect our own energy jobs and for energy independence. Low oil price=high tariff/ high price=low tariff. Stability!
2731 2018-07-23 18:19:32 mixed with teak oil, its a lovely finish.

2735 2018-07-23 18:19:01 Dear @narendramodi jee for Brown Sugar there is a big Market in East Africa through Mombasa/ Kampala and most of the brown sugar is importing from Brazil, Thailand. India has good opportunities for Brown Sugar, Rice and cooking oil in East Africa...
2736 2018-07-23 18:19:00 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2737 2018-07-23 18:18:53 Also...do you know that essential oil diffusing can be really dangerous (deadly) for pets? I know definitely for cats, but it might be good to check if it’s okay for your pup.
2738 2018-07-23 18:18:47 Is it the oil reserves in Iran that the Shah was in control of that makes trump nervous? The change of regime to the Ayatollah’s has kind of backfired, I guess that’s what they call blowback.
2739 2018-07-23 18:18:44 Where are all the environmentalists in the Dominican Republic?
Too busy banning plastic straws, floating in their petroleum based kayaks protesting oil?
Hypocrites!
2740 2018-07-23 18:18:39 Anybody with natural curly hair: have y’all ever got a hot oil treatment and it made ya hair stringy  I’m asking for a friend
2741 2018-07-23 18:18:34 Oil rises on U.S.-Iran tension: Oil prices rose on Monday on worries over supply after tensions worsened between Iran and the United States, while some offshore workers began a 24-hour strike on three oil and gas platforms in the British North Sea.
2742 2018-07-23 18:18:18 I also cashed in on oil today
2743 2018-07-23 18:18:06 What low oil revenue? Do you know the price of a barrel of crude oil now compared to 2015?
2744 2018-07-23 18:18:04 I have the SAME issue with nail splits. The cuticle oil pen stuff does help. I rub that into cuticles and nails. I also use @SallyHansen Diamond Strength nail polish (in clear) and paint both the top of my nail + the underside. That seems to help. Good luck!
2745 2018-07-23 18:18:04 Pt 2 endangered species act is the newest on the attack from the trump administration and the GOP who are in the pockets of the oil and gas industry. We the citizens of America should come together for the protection of the animals, mammals, birds,plants insects that sustain life
2746 2018-07-23 18:17:59 @realDonaldTrump  
Trump’s asinine threats to Iran is on orders from Putin to manipulate the price of oil.
2747 2018-07-23 18:17:55 Cheapest place to get an oil change and fluid check in Colorado Springs? — looking for recommendations
2748 2018-07-23 18:17:42 Well, the oil slick is easy to engineer, but there's just no inexpensive material that I know of that can both absorb shock and heat even from a stinger launch.

Space shuttle tile material is NOT cheap.

Yes, I designed a missile launcher for a car that will work just fine. :)
2749 2018-07-23 18:17:38 Yep, this shows that Americans pay more because of exports. Rich making the money Cheating the consumers Quit Cheating the American Consumers. This is done with Oil, everythingWhen will people wake up

2752 2018-07-23 18:17:25 can you look into why there are so many popular mormon youtubers but also why the essential oil industry is centered in sLC

2759 2018-07-23 18:16:21 Then why in blazes (actual blazes) are you buying and expanding KM? Time that we all face the truth that big oil is running the show.

2761 2018-07-23 18:16:13 Auto companies don't care about coal.  And I'm not sure what Fed Oil subsidies means.  Gas is taxed around $0.50/gal on average in US.  That's about a 20% tax rate.  Far higher than just about any other consumable (other than alchohol/nicotine)
2762 2018-07-23 18:16:12 I hope it come with castor oil.
2763 2018-07-23 18:16:10 People in one of my whatsapp groups are talking about the good things Abacha did, esp in oil and gas investment. I thought it was a taboo.
2764 2018-07-23 18:16:07 (1/2) Solar and wind energy are proven to be effective in reducing fossil fuel energy demand, but no single source of energy is a capable replacement YET, without serious technological and scientific investment. Anti-science oil lobbies won't allow their competition to grow.

- "Sabotaging" an oil deal in totally legitimate and in no way aggression.
I am also unconviced on collusion.
2768 2018-07-23 18:15:42 And if cheering more war? When oil breaks 100 and runs to 150 u will be whining and crying like idiots.
2769 2018-07-23 18:15:37 Nice to see that the town is trying to get back going after that massive fire that put so many outta work. Well that and the lower price on oil.  Fort McMurray is a LONG way north and it gets VERY VERY cold up there, but is also very beautiful.
2770 2018-07-23 18:15:30 ... or Scandinavia? Looks pretty good to me? Venezuela has been the victim of an economic war because they won't give in to us banks and oil companies... not a good example
2771 2018-07-23 18:15:19 When an oil change takes 10 minutes and Chick fil a takes 45 minutes, you know the world is upside down today 
2772 2018-07-23 18:15:13 1A) Take the oil.
2773 2018-07-23 18:15:11 A guy just honked at me and pointed at the sky while I was blotting oil from my face and driving. It wasn’t aggressive, but it was confusing? Was this gentleman trying to tell me that...
2774 2018-07-23 18:15:06 Oil up
2775 2018-07-23 18:15:05 I saw that. I am wondering what data/assumptions were used for (1) GHG emissions from diesel vs CNG engines, (2) GHGs from diesel refining, and (3) relative amounts of GHG emissions (fugitive methane + CO2 from flaring) in gas production versus oil production. Thanks.
2776 2018-07-23 18:15:03 Agree. Sometimes it isn’t that peeps r stupid. Sometimes the snake oil salesman is very good at the con. Jim Jones got people to kill them & their children. Private jet ministers get poor peeps 2 pay 4 the jet. Good con men will fool some of the peeps (29%) all of the time.

2780 2018-07-23 18:14:37 hahaha facts and tarlov like oil and water.  her Trump Derangement Syndrome doesn't help !
2781 2018-07-23 18:14:33 Just passed a billboard advertising a full service oil change plus a steak dinner for $200...where the hell am I?
2782 2018-07-23 18:14:29 "Unbecoming" ....it was also a direct and deliberate manipulation of oil prices.
2783 2018-07-23 18:14:28 Seriously?? You are a snake oil salesman (AKA politician) and cant be taken seriously.
2784 2018-07-23 18:14:25 This just in... lobbiest for "Big Oil" says Climate Change is a hoax.
2785 2018-07-23 18:14:22 Seems everything is a fraud or a hoax to you.  Guess what, you are a fraud.  You are no better than a snake oil salesman.  You lie continuously are are the MOST disrespectful person EVER.  Grow up.
2786 2018-07-23 18:14:10 Better gamer than snake oil peddler #proudgamer
2787 2018-07-23 18:14:08 Civility is important, but you are also part of a government that is helping threaten human civilization through your cluelessness about climate change and fossil fuel investments. A Canada bent on more oil development legitimizes fossil dependence everywhere, burns up our future

2789 2018-07-23 18:13:50 While being a snake oil salesman may be profitable, doesn’t mean it’s a profession to be proud of.

And you, Grant, the guy coming to his defense? You’re one of the marks ...
2790 2018-07-23 18:13:47 Many veterans are thanking us for the help they are getting with our oil.  You can message me for more details.
2791 2018-07-23 18:13:39 Humanity does not have a good track record for allowing scientific facts to prevail and shape the road to the future, eg. the oil and gas industry infrastructure. It was always considered finite. The added factor of intense overpopulation, clearly no politics can save the day.

2795 2018-07-23 18:13:20 He was also securing an increase in oil prices to line his pockets with additional profits. He was successful.
2796 2018-07-23 18:13:15 I’m sure South Carolina has raised boatloads of money for many worthy causes (childhood cancer is one that comes to mind) like most universities do. They just didn’t oil down their football players to do it.
2797 2018-07-23 18:13:07 that’s the oil industry life though

2799 2018-07-23 18:12:54 Oh and the fact that oil seems to be located in the hottest regions of the world bears relevance in its cooling properties
2800 2018-07-23 18:12:45 I do fine with lecithin, but it has to be soy based. Canola lecithin is “infused with vegetables.” Canola oil makes me sick 

I had to be weird 
2801 2018-07-23 18:12:44 is it just me or does going to mechanic shops to get your oil changed so freaking stressful ??!! like sry i don’t know shit abt cars what year is my camry IDK !!

2804 2018-07-23 18:12:32 1/2 Ant War: Day 3 I've resorted to trying a concoction of hot water, canola oil, and dish soap. I've poured it on all the mounds and the wall they are trying to climb to the roof on the outside of our house. Fingers crossed this will do the trick bc the yard spray didn't.
2805 2018-07-23 18:12:28 Yeah we use oil for lots of stuff. Time to move on. Won’t happen over night, but right now probably 75% of the oil we use for transportation could be easily replaced by alternatives. Start there, plastics next.
2806 2018-07-23 18:12:16 Thank god, I'll Finally get a refund.
2807 2018-07-23 18:12:12 When he left twitter there was a trail of oil to the door. True fact.
2808 2018-07-23 18:12:00 I went to 9 mile canyon this weekend. Place is mostly private land, vandalism all over, nothing is marked except where gas/oil pumps are and mines, the place stinks...good job Utah.

2810 2018-07-23 18:11:45 Cuz it'd upset oil flow & we all know that can't happen. :p I am cautiously optimistic with the reforms being made in Saudi. Not everyone gonna be happy but then again, this place needs it so badly. Onwards! ;)

2812 2018-07-23 18:11:19 very toxic to  society, like turpentine is to oil paint. It just totally dissolves the  integrity of the other. That is what's   happening.  Only by recognizing  these disorders and learning methods  of  getting them out of  4/
2813 2018-07-23 18:11:16 He knows Venezuela is a narco terrorist state and Hezbollahs engagement in LATAM. That 20% oil we get from Venezuela keeps him from war.
2814 2018-07-23 18:11:13 They forget that Russia is allied to Iran. 

And that nuking Iran would kill millions of innocent people. Oh wait, let me put it in terms they understand. It would destroy or taint billions of barrels of oil.
2815 2018-07-23 18:11:13 Before a 5 day backpacking trip, my nightly dreams consisted exclusively of Billy Hargrove and Steve Harrington reading palm oil mill names to each other while in a spin class. I am really glad to have refreshed my mind and am now dreaming only of marmots and wildflowers

2825 2018-07-23 18:09:55 Just when I thought I've seen it all. Crystal infused water bottles is a "thing". My, my. The next snake oil. :D
2826 2018-07-23 18:09:40 Oil rises on U.S.-Iran tension
2827 2018-07-23 18:09:36 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
2828 2018-07-23 18:09:33 legos and olive oil
2829 2018-07-23 18:09:27 State run media brought to you by the same people that call Trump Hitler. 
Is this the beginning of a guaranteed government jobs program?
2830 2018-07-23 18:09:18 Poor lady needs some MCT oil for her brain. I don’t think the word “blame” is appropriate though. I hope I look as young as she does when I get dementia
2831 2018-07-23 18:09:12 What country kept the Shah of Iran in power on The Peacock Throne? And was it because of oil or buttermilk?
2832 2018-07-23 18:09:10 Wouldn't mind rubbing those down with some coconut oil love 
2833 2018-07-23 18:08:57 THAT AND yet another republican potus threatening to preemptively start another war in the middle east. Well that’s one way to cut off our oil supplies and force more drilling in protected areas!! MORE MONEY MORE MONEY for him!
2834 2018-07-23 18:08:55 I know this but oil used to be at the surface, now it’s miles down and your trying to convince me that losing miles and miles of a liquid as thick as oil makes no difference to the temperature of the earths crust, it’s basic thermodynamics,
2835 2018-07-23 18:08:48 ほとんどがそうだけど、
2836 2018-07-23 18:08:45 The entire world runs on oil, and relies on plastics.
It’s never going to stop.
That’s “reality”. 
Might as well make money on it as safely as we can.
2837 2018-07-23 18:08:43 Isn’t it a a leap to say that the people “attacking” Dan represent Big Oil?

2843 2018-07-23 18:07:26 Well you're losing ppl like myself cause u wanna keep coal alive when we can clearly go solar wind and water and hemp oil why not start loving our planet and stop hating on animals as i know u thought u were but no killing them doesn't help the eco system you're truly killing 
2844 2018-07-23 18:07:12 Again distraction!  Is it because you don’t want Americans to notice you are opening National monuments to oil drilling, fracking and logging? Why are you closing National parks and monuments to the American public but allowing corporations to rape the public lands?

2848 2018-07-23 18:06:38 What are you talking about? Are you accusing me of being paid to campaign against wind? How very unoriginal of you if you are. Tedious too. Who would be paying me? Big Oil, Big Coal??? Do tell.
2849 2018-07-23 18:06:33 The WSJ's headlines today all portend economic instability due to our President's policies:

- Trump Tweet on Iran Stirs Oil Markets
- U.S. Bond Yield Nears 3% on Concerns About Demand Abroad
- U.S. Existing-Home Sales Tumbled Again in June
- Stocks Waver as Investors Weigh Trade
2850 2018-07-23 18:06:33 How much is an oil change?
2851 2018-07-23 18:06:26 I predict China, Russia and North Korea will all start working together against America. China and Russia are already smuggling oil to NK.
2852 2018-07-23 18:06:18 If it was about oil we'd have let Saddam take over Kuwait before moving in. You really are clueless
2853 2018-07-23 18:06:16 We put cinnamon in it so it taste like cinnamon and coconut coffee. We really like it but I struggle with the thought of drinking butter and coconut oil so it took some getting used to mentally. I like it now. (Coffee, tbs unsalted butter, tbs Coconut oil in blender until froth)
2854 2018-07-23 18:06:05 Got my wheel fixed, new break pads, oil change. I’m ready for Thursday
2855 2018-07-23 18:05:58 Boiled yam with red oil, fresh yellow pepper, ukpaka, onions and utazi leaf. 

Later guys 
2856 2018-07-23 18:05:54 There's oil reserves off the Falkland's, it's unlikely that UK plc will simply hand this over to Argentina even when they have a legitimate claim to them..
2857 2018-07-23 18:05:39 The big mistake was pulling out of the Iranian agreement where the US had verifying rights. No military leader is going to support war. The US just pulled out an agreement that would keep pressure on them. Sanctions to shut off oil results—$3.00 gas.
2858 2018-07-23 18:05:30 Oil money in my account is a reality.  Thank God for Shalom 
Congratulations dear!!!
2859 2018-07-23 18:05:26 Senior diplomat & nuclear negotiator @araghchi : #Iran's first demand is selling oil & ability to take home its #oil revenues. #EU has until August 6 to offer its practical steps.
2860 2018-07-23 18:05:13 Dont forget EPA has been cutting our regs. protecting us from poisons in agriculture, chemical co. dumps into rivers & oceans, oil & gas drilling, ind.waste, they cut regs. we came up with so Deepwater Horizon oil spill doesnt happen again, Agri. Chem. that affects kids brains

2862 2018-07-23 18:05:03 質が大事なんだよなぁ...
2863 2018-07-23 18:05:02 A salamander in a jar of olive oil isn't as slimy as Donald J Trump. Our Pres is now acting much like Nixon acted during his dwindling days. His tweets have that separated from reality nuance like when Nixon talked to the portraits hanging on the walls.
2864 2018-07-23 18:05:01 Dear Mr. President @POTUS , you did what you can against IRAN! IRAN just said what will do in future if you stop exporting Oil! Now you afraid not IRAN, just because you have more things to lose than IRAN.
Be sure, if you repect you will gain more. 
#StopMeddlingInIran
2865 2018-07-23 18:04:59 Exactly! Even oil couldn’t rally.
2866 2018-07-23 18:04:46 You give your car an oil change and the bitch start acting different.
2867 2018-07-23 18:04:41 I seriously doubt he gives a damn about the horses. They’re not named Trump. He can’t profit from them. The powerful oil, gas and ranchers/beef lobbies have worked hard for a long time to try to rid the US of the wild horses.

I don't plan on giving up yet.
2870 2018-07-23 18:04:05 @realDonaldTrump beware the rising price of oil, and thus gas, to all Americans
2871 2018-07-23 18:04:02 Would you try to become famous by creating a sculpture of the Mona Lisa? Recreating Starry Night using only charcoal? Oil painting the thinker? Then don’t post social media screenshots across platforms.

2873 2018-07-23 18:03:53 Baking Tips for our Cake Mix Matte Foundation:

1. Type of Bakeware: dense brush
2. Ingredients: Wake & Bake Oil, Hydrating Primer is optional (best for dry skin) and the Cake Mix!
3. Process: On a fresh face, oily or dry skin, apply 1-3 drops of our oil.

2876 2018-07-23 18:03:36 Bahrain trading oil for infrastructure. So would be an example of two economies giving concessions for advantages in other areas 
2877 2018-07-23 18:03:33 Hopefully divest from being in bed with dirty oil companies too 
2878 2018-07-23 18:03:15 The oil on some people's face can fry Akara  
2879 2018-07-23 18:03:05 Probably a lot, lol. I think they are due for a strong earnings report,  but then again this company hasn't been able to get it together yet, so let's hope they have finally figured it out with $70 oil.
2880 2018-07-23 18:03:04 Spanish sage hair clay, hand salve, cologne, and cleansing oil from a men’s boutique
2881 2018-07-23 18:03:01 But of course they did. Are they still threatening to shutdown straight to all unless it's to purchase oil from them.
2882 2018-07-23 18:03:00 #China Cancels all oil purchases from #Iran after Trump's tweet to purchase from #SaudiArabia instead.

We won't block Iran's oil shipments, but won't be much shipping without buyers.

2883 2018-07-23 18:02:52 Sick to my stomach. Denial of science (climate change, wildlife studies, etc) is a real political strategy by right. They’ve convinced 30-40% of pop it’s a good thing so they pad oil & gas industry’s pockets at expense of everything else on planet. I’m so furious every single day
2884 2018-07-23 18:02:48 Why don’t you ever talk about the fact that the USA & UK overthrew Iran’s democratically elected government in the 1950s and inserted a dictator so that we could get cheaper oil. We turned the once majestic Iran into the mess it is today. But you say nothing?
2885 2018-07-23 18:02:42 5.Slice the loaf into desired slice size. You can toast the bread if desired, or serve un-toasted. To toast, rapid preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil. Lay the slices down on the foil and cover with butter or olive oil. Bake for 8-10 mins until brown.
2886 2018-07-23 18:02:40 @Edinburgh_CC Stevenlaw's Close in the Royal Mile is again not been hosed in a fortnight and is stinking with bird keech, film of oil from Resturant bins in transit and flies preventing the residents opening their windows. Disappointing given the great improvement in recent times

2889 2018-07-23 18:02:25 I don’t worry so much about when I start. 

As long as I start and get done what I need to. 

Sometimes I’m up at 8am and I knock everything out by the afternoon. 

Sometimes the evening rolls around and I end up burning the midnight oil. 

Whatever feels most natural that day.

2894 2018-07-23 18:01:49 I can't wait to get into painting again. I've worked with acrylics for so long and i could only go so far with them. But my parents are blessings and got me oil paints and everything I need to use them. This broadens my horizons and I'm so excited to learn how to use them!!!
2895 2018-07-23 18:01:46 If I wasn't as delicate at the mo I'd help more but . . . you know how I feel so I've no need to elaborate. Legal CBD oil works ok but the concentration you require for pain is really expensive (and nowhere near as effective in my experience)
2896 2018-07-23 18:01:43 I'm yet to see any Nigerian politician either past, present or dead that was rich or was wealthy or is rich or is wealthy without STEALING (not Corruption now bcos we love to deceive ourselves) from Nigerians tax money or from Nigeria's oil money.

The good News of the Gospel never changes! God is Sovereign above all else. He wins in the end. So do we who believe & obey. 
None of this crazy stuff should surprise us as believers.
Get oil in your lamps & sharpen your swords.
Battle has begun!
2900 2018-07-23 18:01:23 Why is trump opening National monuments and parks to oil drilling, fracking and logging but closing those monuments to tourists,fishing and hunting?

2927 2018-07-23 17:58:41 Nigeria has 3 or 4 (non functional refineries) built in the 70s & early 80s...now obsolete...16 years of oil boom we didn't add even ONE. #historyville
2928 2018-07-23 17:58:30 It's our M.D. medical directoring today. Doctors take fish oil and smoke marijuana from a dedicated person. To physically help second hand smoker's.
2929 2018-07-23 17:58:20 Dickhead! You're only relevant because of Arab oil money. You'd still be fighting in the 2nd/3rd tier otherwise. Our money has come to fruition through growth on and off the pitch and player sales. We haven't been bankrolled like you lot. Give your head a wobble e'h.
2930 2018-07-23 17:58:18 There booming here , most company's are hiring or expanding or both. Help is difficult to find for most trade type jobs , oil field jobs , manufacturing or assembly jobs . not sure where your from but i haven't seen this good a situation since the late 80's

2933 2018-07-23 17:58:02 Irán lacks strategic depth - 80 m people need feeding every day and like Venezuela oil is overwhelming income. Collapse is quick when hunger beckons .... but the Pope- Ayatollah ( chief) knows that.

2947 2018-07-23 17:56:41 Iran's leaders this weekend threatened to shut the strait, the world's most important seaborne transit lane for oil. The comments appeared to provoke a late-night response from President Donald Trump threatening severe consequences for Iran.

You need to get a grip because not all leaders will "play along" like Kim Jung-Un did and will retaliate. Thought you didn't believe in war and intervention. But oh...
2953 2018-07-23 17:56:01 I wanted something that doesn't contain fat and oil 
2954 2018-07-23 17:55:58 @FoxBusiness Please fix the oil price on TV. It isn't updating because it is quoting the August contract which expired last week. Update to the September contract to correct this issue.
2955 2018-07-23 17:55:42 Magnolia tissue oil, you can find it at Pep. It works & it's very affordable

2957 2018-07-23 17:55:38 Drop the round up. Add in some sencor and crop oil. Have to have the Triazine to make it work better.
2958 2018-07-23 17:55:38 How idiotic do you have to be to threaten nuclear powers like this. I understand @realDonaldTrump  has 0 brain cells, but you'd still expect him to have some understanding on how not to ruin his own countries economy (considering Iran sells a large chunk of the worlds oil)
2959 2018-07-23 17:55:36 Hi there, our Lullaby shampoo bar has lavender oil which is great for balancing the scalp and hair. We also use oat milk and almond meal, to offer a ultra-soothing and softening cleanse that won't aggravate your scalp.

2964 2018-07-23 17:54:46 it’s really stupid to say harry’s long hair was greasy he was just using coconut oil to keep it hydrated and you’re all ungrateful bitc*es
2965 2018-07-23 17:54:37 Oil
2966 2018-07-23 17:54:28 ,,,,,,,,, oil
2967 2018-07-23 17:54:25 *kisses you softly as I warm some oil in my palm and smooth it over the soft velvety skin of your cock and balls, humming as you groan softly* Feel good?
2968 2018-07-23 17:54:20 This is still much better than the Bush years, with daily reports of dead Americans returning from Iraq, new torture cases happening, and more civilians being reported killed, while Bush kept extending tours and cutting soldiers benefits while they were fighting for his oil
2969 2018-07-23 17:54:15 Lmao. Weak is not getting NK into peace talks or getting the Saudis to release more oil production on demand. You are clueless. Standing up to an evil regime's threats is not weak either. Sneaking millions of dollars to Iran in middle of the night, illegally, is weak.
2970 2018-07-23 17:54:01 I had 2 get my heart ultrasound so I was laying there tiddys out covered in oil I got a male doctor luckily he was just interested in converting me 2 Christianity so I didn’t have to worry about my modesty
2971 2018-07-23 17:53:57 If we look back a few centuries I think our diets were actually great. We added in vegetable oil and white sugar and flour and screwed it up
2972 2018-07-23 17:53:41 What is missing from discussion is that this free market fantasy policy proposal is a Big Oil Get Out of Jail Free card. To offer fossil fuel majors immunity from climate liability is opposite of #climatejustice. Action to #keepitintheground is what is needed #StandUpToBigOil
2973 2018-07-23 17:53:37 Great 1st half at the @LakeMiTechCon ! We are the snake oil! #LMTC18 #LizKolb
2974 2018-07-23 17:53:35 I know. My Moultons are only 15 and they have full suspension, guards, racks, hub gears and Dyno lighting. They must be using recycled oil rigs for the tubing
2975 2018-07-23 17:53:30 that’s literally key ladies. go get y’all some wild growth hair oil. it’s Black girl magic in a tube. @WildGrowthCo
2976 2018-07-23 17:53:30 you know how when it's cold coconut oil gets hard and when it's hot it melts? yeah so um, it's summer... the coconut oil is therefore in its liquid state... and for some reason my dad thought it was WATER and emptied the entirety of it in the sink 
2977 2018-07-23 17:53:29 Wigs and weave will help your hair grow as long as u oil your scalp and make sure ur moisturized
2978 2018-07-23 17:53:17 Egyptian pyramid with the fossil fuel Tomb  archaeology find all oil equipment human remain from  drill rig explosion gas station pump Texaco sign OPEC sign contract Oil Treasury Bond stock certificate 
2979 2018-07-23 17:53:16 Ahhh amazing! I don’t know how it would work but I would need something as natural a poss, so not like a white cream that has an extract of it. And probably with cbd oil rather than hemp oil. Let me know if you come across anything! Xx
2980 2018-07-23 17:53:15 Nothing like the fear of thermo nuclear war to increase crude oil prices.   #treasoninplainsight This is a dereliction of duty by @realDonaldTrump
2981 2018-07-23 17:53:10 Next time just use 2chopped onions when they turn brown add 1tomato pureed ...bhuno it...when oil leaves the gravy add peas and cheese little bit of water ,give one whistle,open it &add halfa teasp garam masala powder.....it's dn
2982 2018-07-23 17:53:00 There is no illusion quite so powerful as oil delusion. So, seems to be my lesson for today.
2983 2018-07-23 17:52:51 Fish oil?
2984 2018-07-23 17:52:49 I am sure he threatened Iran for  only one reason: to raise oil price.
2985 2018-07-23 17:52:38 Said no hot girl ever
2986 2018-07-23 17:52:34 Hang it, draw it and then quarter it. Then cut its head off at its scrawny next. Stick the head on a spike outside the White House. Next gut it exposing all its entrails and finally toss it all into boiling oil until crisp and black. Then throw it all away as it will taste fowl !
2987 2018-07-23 17:52:33 Their words don’t have any credibility. They said the same words when there was infant formula scandal a few years ago, they have been saying that word whenever there is a public anger towards government misconduct on events such as marketing garbage oil for eating, etc.
2988 2018-07-23 17:52:18 Uhhh who judges women by their looks more? Men or other women?

I’ll give you a hint. Not men.
2989 2018-07-23 17:52:18 @jomalonelondon Please add to range of body & hair oil! The LBM one is  !!
2990 2018-07-23 17:52:15 That's one nasty looking bird, I would boil it in oil.
2991 2018-07-23 17:52:05 If the USA attacks Iran, it will be all bikes on the streets! the price of oil will be over 200/barrel
2992 2018-07-23 17:52:01 if you take a bottle of virgin olive oil and put your finger in it, is it still virgin?
2993 2018-07-23 17:51:57 Since Jimmy 'Appeasement' Carter pulled the Persian rug from under the Shah of Iran in 1979, allowing 7th century based, fanatically anti-Western, Shi'ite madmen to seize control of Iran and her OPEC oil wealth, plus long overdue payback for Iran's decades of terrorism worldwide.
2994 2018-07-23 17:51:57 Also, Murad has this bomb ass multi vitamin infusion oil that i loveeeee
2995 2018-07-23 17:51:54 I can't stand these charlatans! They're all self-serving bigots that will sell their unsuspecting followers snake oil to line their thieving pockets with lies about salvation! 
I suspect that hell is filled with these  "men of the cloth!"
2996 2018-07-23 17:51:52 LRT: Also see the Oil Kings have hired former Ducks AC Brad Lauer as HC. Went to a Coaching talk of his while working in Anaheim and learned a grip. Really good Coach.
2997 2018-07-23 17:51:47 Could be all those oil workers that she told an international audience were  traveling from town to town sexually assaulting women.
2998 2018-07-23 17:51:43 You #rummyeyedoldfool. He won’t do anything as long as Russia is buying Iranian oil. He is trying to create another fake crisis to pretend to solve. Someone take the matches from the #toddlerincheif
2999 2018-07-23 17:51:36 And then there's the eyelid. My derm thought I had a basal cell. Operations on the eyelid are unpleasant. I stuck thick ophthalmic ointment in my eye and dabbed on the tea tree oil. Gone in 3 days, hasn't come back- Had dry eye for years in that eye though. I think from TTO.
3000 2018-07-23 17:51:29 We sell both, our tinctures do have a blend of coconut oil and CBD. Typically the oils without fillers can be a very thick consistency more like a paste. So if you want to take it sublingually, it needs to be in a carrier oil 
3001 2018-07-23 17:51:20 Can y’all recommend me a good face soap, I’m over this coconut oil shit .
3002 2018-07-23 17:51:14 Extracting fossil fuels and burning them is causing the Earth to heat up. Governments and the oil industry know this but are in bed together for short term money gains, they are complicit together in allowing this to happen. The ultimate in short-sightedness.
3003 2018-07-23 17:51:14 Getting my first oil change since i got my car  I'm terrible i know,  needa be taking better care of her
3004 2018-07-23 17:51:12 peppermint oil? now thats a first

3007 2018-07-23 17:50:45 We happily stand by when the situation doesn’t suit us. We watch Israel slaughter Palestinians on a daily basis. The war in Iraq was for oil. The people of iraq hate us for destroying their country, as do the Libyans

3015 2018-07-23 17:49:28 Key maritime route. The Strait of Hormuz is the key maritime transit route through which Persian Gulf exporters (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Bahrain) ship their oil.
3016 2018-07-23 17:49:16 I'm happy and avoid the sun. That's really all there is to it. Oh, and olive oil, inside and out, baby.

3022 2018-07-23 17:49:03 I don't buy into the whole "BUT WE NEED PEOPLE TO DO THIS" like of apocalyptic thinking. There will always be people who do it. And hopefully they will do it better than the Daily News, as an organization, has in recent years/decades.

3027 2018-07-23 17:48:23 Duh! It’s not the fact that it’s heating up, it’s what is causing it to heat that’s the argument, and people in power wouldn’t want you to know that taking oil out of the earth is causing global warming we could all sue the oil industry
3028 2018-07-23 17:48:23 I'm a journalist, for the record. I don't consider it a travesty. I know a couple of people who work there, and they're good at what they do, and I hope they land on their feet somehow. That's the extent of my caring about this.

3040 2018-07-23 17:47:02 In addition to stringent sanctions, President Trump has also called out Russia publicly.

During a landmark speech last year in Poland, Trump lambasted Russia for using oil to hold NATO's Eastern European countries hostage. Trump underscored the dangers of those countries
3041 2018-07-23 17:46:57 Ok to get rid of the snake oil word for today. It is shonda

3052 2018-07-23 17:45:32 The real target is Iran. John Bolton has a wet spot in his pants every time he thinks about it. US corporations are pining to for a get the oil war and to do to the bidding of Saudis and Israel. #FACTS
3053 2018-07-23 17:45:29 Why would he want to undo clean air regulations?! It makes no sense, especially when you consider neither consumers, nor auto makers want these changes.

3063 2018-07-23 17:44:40 Hope you’re correct. I’m more anxious about this than ever was about NK for reasons stated above. 

Possible Putin OK with it as it helps his puppet, increases price of oil, and perhaps opens door for further expansion into Ukraine for zero cost.
3064 2018-07-23 17:44:38 Meanwhile, fake-Liberals levying a *cash-grab* carbon tax on the little-guy (who already can't afford 2b out joyriding around), while they fully support Big Oil & pipeline — which is *not* about the relatively insignificant job creation, compared to $4.5 billion just for openers!

3068 2018-07-23 17:44:33 It doesn't say any of that and the fact you're trying to sell that snake oil right now when 11 wrestlers have named you specifically as knowing they were molested & over 100 have come forward on the record you should be defending #TraitorTrump less and #ResignJimJordan-ing more.

Clubs who's history only extended to a few cup runs before they hit the sugar daddy jackpot.
3075 2018-07-23 17:43:59 Sounds like Trump had a Charlie horse in one of his Twitter finger muscles last night.  God forbid Trump consult with one of OUR Military experts before he has a pathological Twitter spasm at 11:30 pm.  Is Trump trying to artificially inflate oil prices so Russia can profit?

3080 2018-07-23 17:43:35 Oil Prices rose amid worries over supply after tensions worsened between Iran and the United States, while some offshore workers began a 24-hour strike on three oil and gas platforms in the British North Sea.

3086 2018-07-23 17:42:38 Mr Amechi been a long time. Na you be this. Preparing for 2019 no port Harcourt oil money that makes you party favorite then. Welcome back the crig await u. Radarada
3087 2018-07-23 17:42:36 If only we had a pipeline to link us to one of the worlds largest oil deposits

3089 2018-07-23 17:42:28 Unionist lies. We will no longer be funding English building projects or UK Gov spending & debt, & we’ll be keeping all of our own revenues, even that which is currently unaccounted for such as our exports directly from oil rigs. We’ll be in the EU & a goto place for EU business.
3090 2018-07-23 17:42:14 she is ugly on the inside just as much as the outside.
3091 2018-07-23 17:42:04 Interesting point, because that would make their oil exports more valuable and they are cash starved right now.
3092 2018-07-23 17:42:00 LEMME JUST TELL YOU, MY FIRST STEP OF FOGHTING ANY COLD OR INFECTION IS POPPING A CLOVE OF GARLIC SOAKED IN OLIVE OIL UP MY VAGINA AND DRINKING DROPS OF OREGANO. MAMA ITALIA NONA NINANA TAUGHT ME THE TRICK THE MARINARA MIRACLE. TASTES LIKE PIZZA.
3093 2018-07-23 17:41:47 It was his lying and cheating acts that were discovered that caused it!! Stop lying to all the morons in Dumbassistan that were stupid enough to buy your snake oil David Dennison!!!
3094 2018-07-23 17:41:39 I would agree given oil's mature profitable business cycle.  Not a fan of how Cali runs its state.  Would prefer he let the state's decide on this issue.
3095 2018-07-23 17:41:27 If straws get us started on a conversation about plastics -- especially single use plastics -- then it's worthy, I reckon. It may be ... wait for it ... the straw that breaks the (oil) cartel's back.
3096 2018-07-23 17:41:24 Add oil I haven't written much for my smut yet but yeah

3099 2018-07-23 17:41:17 you meant to keep repeating stop cock?
you just had me and @OurKate_Oil trying and you cant do it..
3100 2018-07-23 17:41:16 You’re mixed with rose water and coconut oil 
3101 2018-07-23 17:41:08 Put the coconut oil on your hair as a mask. Leave it on  at least 20 minutes. - or wear a shower cap overnight. Argan oil with a drop of tea tree oil can be used daily. It isn’t as heavy. Just a p size should do. Enjoy!
3102 2018-07-23 17:40:57 Aren't there vast oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean? Why don't Israel and Egypt develop these for their own use and to sell to Europe?
3103 2018-07-23 17:40:45 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower

3113 2018-07-23 17:39:48 Oil creates wealth, generates tax revenue. Tesla burns cash, consumes tax $.
3114 2018-07-23 17:39:42 Finally cleaned my car and got an oil change I feel somewhat productive
3115 2018-07-23 17:39:34 "I was called by Mr George Galloway - member of the British Parliament, principle lobbyist for the Iraqi Ba'ath party, defender of the forces of Jihad, and profiteer from the oil-for-food scandal - a 'Drink-soaked, ex-Trotskyist popinjay'.

Only some of which is unfair."
3116 2018-07-23 17:39:13 They only had to report the oil. They don't have to report a brine spill.
Which is used all the time in oil production.
3117 2018-07-23 17:39:03 All I want is for my coconut oil to be solid again 
3118 2018-07-23 17:39:02 Atleast my baker puts up a sign to the effect of they've had to increase prices a bit across the board as their input costs have risen. Now is that correlated to oil price or just fiat debasement?
3119 2018-07-23 17:39:01 by the time i was 7 years old my skin wrinkled so tightly that it looked like my brain was on the outside. if i had used coconut oil i would still look 6, which is usually the last age anyone has good skin.

3121 2018-07-23 17:38:51 Of course this administration would dismiss (and hide from view) key benefits to the actual public on this move. It might have hurt the oil drilling and fracking businesses’ ability to a one-off ability to buy the land and destroy it.
3122 2018-07-23 17:38:40 I think it’s the oil in Alaska but this is big too

3124 2018-07-23 17:38:23 We saw it last night. The Iran attack tweet was meant to start disruptions in the already volatile oil and gas markets to drive up world wide prices and enrich Russia.

The EU will feel the brunt of the price rises, feeding discontent and strengthening EU’s far-right.
3125 2018-07-23 17:38:14 I know this is late, but put a little baby oil on a cotton round and it comes right off.
3126 2018-07-23 17:38:10 So wait a second. You're suggesting Zinke and Co. really don't like the country's wonderful national monuments? That they would hide the truth about how many people from around the world love to visit them? That they'd prefer to see drilling rigs and oil wells there? Shocking!
3127 2018-07-23 17:38:09 If conventional refined oil was transported through the pipeline it wouldn't be as devastating. However that doesn't address the 7fold increase in tankers off Vancouver. That also is an issue. Tourism will suffer. #smh

3129 2018-07-23 17:37:43 The Russian people support Putin because they are better off now than they have been for 200 years.

3131 2018-07-23 17:37:37 A clogged PCV breather filter can prevent the PCV from siphoning away those gases and moisture caused by engine combustion, resulting in oil breakdown and sludge buildup. This filter should be replaced every 30,000 miles, or even better once a year.
3132 2018-07-23 17:37:36 I don’t eat Eba, I’ve cut out bread, I rarely eat rice and stew anymore cos of oil, done intermittent fasting, workout 3-4 times a week doing mostly fitness blender and initially doing NIKE training (NTC) workouts. I have cheat meals once a week
3133 2018-07-23 17:37:29 Loved this game! Drove all the way from Virginia to see my first colts game at Lucas Oil and they surely made it worth the ride up there!!!

I selected CPP/Vit E applied with a Q-tip for about week.  Nice heat!  Good choice, hardly noticeable, slight wrinkle.

3146 2018-07-23 17:36:10 In your opinion what did the Obama admin get, if anything, in return for allowing oil exports.  TY for ur time.
3147 2018-07-23 17:36:06 The party is split. We have the moderate democrats and we have the Bernie Sanders supporters and they mix like oil and water. I'm really afraid about what I'm seeing. He just won't give it up. I'm trying to see where core strength is. Sleepless in California.
3148 2018-07-23 17:36:03 Peepee tape and oil route.

3154 2018-07-23 17:35:45 Aye plenty of big stars do. No offence to Griff but I doubt he's given it much, if any, thought. It's money for nothing from his perspective.

I've always suspected it's snake oil and really should be banned if it is

I'm doing spinach , bacon, & chicken tonight
3159 2018-07-23 17:35:18 Of course this administration would dismiss key benefits to the actual public on this move. It might have hurt the oil drilling and fracking businesses’ ability to buy up the land in order to destroy it.

3175 2018-07-23 17:34:00 No need for the government party to sell snake oil like the anti-government party.  Republicans will always be better at selling snake oil than Democrats.
3176 2018-07-23 17:33:59 Mr Lecturer again. Pretty much all palm oil production and all vegetable oil production is commercialized - small scale to large scale all try to make money. In places like Kalimantan, 30% causes deforestation, 70% is on deforested land. Question is: are any other oils better?

3185 2018-07-23 17:32:53 Trump voter here.  Not the fight to pick.  I want competition in the combustion engine space.  Oil gets plenty of incentives.
3186 2018-07-23 17:32:39 Lmao I look like trash rn but apparently the dude doing my oil change didn’t think so because he was being all kinds of flirty and he ended up giving me a discount YEET

3191 2018-07-23 17:32:04 Anx they also did it so the rings stays in the oil and won't gone, making it one of the easiest bosses in the game 
3192 2018-07-23 17:31:56 Senator, Trump's Iran strategy is obvious: re-institute sanctions, which will remove Iranian oil from the global market. Reduced supply, in turn, will increase oil prices, providing a major financial short in the arm to Russia. Clear?
3193 2018-07-23 17:31:54 The war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and his counterpart in Iran over oil exports and sanctions is shining a spotlight on the narrow, twisting conduit for about 30 percent of the world’s seaborne-traded crude.
3194 2018-07-23 17:31:49 Aye the oil
3195 2018-07-23 17:31:44 what is the meaning of this contango ? 
Will the price of oil rise or fall?
TY
3196 2018-07-23 17:31:33 Do you bread positivity with or without cornflakes? What oil do you use? Does positivity even taste good?
3197 2018-07-23 17:31:24 Oh good, oil prices will rise, which is good for oil producer buddies of Trump, both V. Putin & US oil producers
3198 2018-07-23 17:31:23 I happy cry a lot more and do adult things like getting my oil changed by myself but I also spilled a pitcher of wine on myself at an arcade. 22 is about balance

Me: Excuse me for enjoying helping my neighbors and keeping my town clean
3202 2018-07-23 17:30:51 POTUS lashes out against Iran in ALL CAPS.
Iran threatens to close the strait of Hormuz, a strategic pathway for the world's oil.
We are going down a bad path...
3203 2018-07-23 17:30:48 #Strait of Hurmuz Closure? War possible between Iran, Israel, US? A possible military conflict could cause a huge barrage of problems between several countries in the Middle East, and probably the closure of Strait of Hormuz! 
As a consequence crude oil prices could explode!

3215 2018-07-23 17:29:49 coconut oil is extremely heavy, even with my hair, it ends up being super oily, even if I don’t put much on it. Try castor oil alone, or argan oil, which is really lightweight.
3216 2018-07-23 17:29:40 I'm sure Donald and his handlers know where the oil is. If you're going to wag the dog (that'll bring out the trolls), you might as well kill 2 birds with one stone. Ask Trump to name the AFRICAN countries on a map...
3217 2018-07-23 17:29:39 why is this? Oil? There is such a weird disconnect there.

3228 2018-07-23 17:29:00 The Koch Brothers have planned all deregulation so the OIL and GAS industries could do what ever they wanted.   Good try, but with Koch money controlling most of GOP...good luck
3229 2018-07-23 17:28:58 Tourists don't line pockets like the oil and gas lobby does though.
3230 2018-07-23 17:28:53 so all of my pay is going towards bills this week  which includes car insurance, credit card bills and oil change sheesh I hate being an adult

3237 2018-07-23 17:28:21 has  been a year since he did the oil change. He did ask if he had done something wrong for reason I have not had him do oil changes. Nope just more convenient, stop get the oil changed and then off on more errands. Oops

3242 2018-07-23 17:27:57 I remember being told that planes will fall out of the sky at midnight during the millennium and an independent Scotland would have billions in oil revenue every year so forgive me if I don't start filling the deep freeze for the post brexit famine 
3243 2018-07-23 17:27:56 Not if we do a land invasion and open it up for everyone to use and the world would never have to worry about strongman tactics ever again, oil prices would fall. Quit fear mongering

3246 2018-07-23 17:27:43 US/Uk do not give a shit how regimes treat their people.They just want to get rid of regimes who no longer use the petrodollar.1951 they removed Dr Mossadeq who was democraticalky elected because he wanted rid of the Anglo/persian oil co (now BP). That worked well for Iranians

3249 2018-07-23 17:27:26 So the last few times I have gotten an oil change I have just gone to Jiffy Lube. Just more convenient, bring it wait about half hr and done rather than drop off at my mechanic and not have my car for the day. So he just called asking what kind of oil I have been using since it
3250 2018-07-23 17:27:20 The search should not be for who gets hurt with high oil prices. Rather who dies with really high oil prices. Acute stress.
3251 2018-07-23 17:27:06 Glad you included Murray. Scots are considered wholly separate unless using their oil or winning sports then British.
3252 2018-07-23 17:27:03 Here is the complete stupidity of the media falling for this new smoke and mirrors tactic of the WH....expecting China and India to not buy oil from Iran after leveling billions of tariffs on them is ridiculous and not going to happen.  Russia is also Irans closet ally.

3258 2018-07-23 17:26:31 I wish I was on a Greek island by the sea eating some fresh octopus in olive oil and lemon juice, with a side of warm rustic fresh bread, a chunk of tart yet salty feta cheese and a glass of ouzo. Ahhh. To dream... Hello sadness my old friend.  
3259 2018-07-23 17:26:19 Oh, yes that was sort of my point. Gulf countries have relatively high GDP despite few women in the workforce, likely explainable by oil economy. The chart shows “year fertility began declining,” not “year it reached low western rates.”

3280 2018-07-23 17:24:12 Its the same you that will say he is focusing on the place where oil was firsts found instead of Nigeria as a whole .. insatiable and hypocritical Nigerians ..
3281 2018-07-23 17:24:11 Actually Iran IS a potential problem. Due to geography they can block vast amounts of the world's oil from moving through the Straits of Hormuz.
3282 2018-07-23 17:24:11 Unfortunately very few seem willing to accept the fact that the 'age of oil' is coming to an end sooner rather than later. The absence of a real plan (from all parties) is terrifying.
3283 2018-07-23 17:24:10 Inasmuch as there is still crude oil in Nigeria, there will still be poverty.
3284 2018-07-23 17:24:06 Looks like #StormyDanielsLover isn’t satisfied with the 30% he’s jacked up #gasprices for his oil company friends by saber rattling. So he’s starting again, with Iran. But even Iran must know slumpy tRumpy is a paper tiger. Or maybe a paper cockroach #PutinsPoodle

3324 2018-07-23 17:19:47 Erdogan was clashing with Putin and Assad while Brits were still planning how to steal Syrian oil and share the already stolen Iraq oil. Just because your media parrots "dictator" obsessively won't make it true. As a Turkish Özil already knows this as 40m voters of Erdogan
3325 2018-07-23 17:19:44 Why. I don’t have Obamacare and I didn’t have to go to anybody different. If you doctor wouldn’t take your insurance it was his decision to not work with you and drop you.

3334 2018-07-23 17:18:24 Kibi but, it’s a global problem... Now Iran is talking of putting a blockade on its oil due to US sanctions.
3335 2018-07-23 17:18:23 Also worth mentioning that the Steele dossier asserts Trump was given a huge stake in Roseneft - the Russian state-owned oil company - in exchange for lifting sanctions, so he would directly benefit from gas-guzzling cars.
3336 2018-07-23 17:18:21 This is the Alamo of defenses... a narrative that grows weaker by the day... one that’s now mocked, even by fellow Republicans. 

We expected it from Trump. He wasn’t going to accept getting caught. But we underestimated how many of his supporters would keep buying his snake oil.

3341 2018-07-23 17:18:09 Oil and onions first (preferably with curry leaves). Let onions brown a bit. Then masala spice with chopped garlic and ginger. Then add chopped meat or chicken. Allow to Brown, add chopped tomatoes (tinned OK). Then add any chopped veg you like. Easy.  But a good start....
3342 2018-07-23 17:18:03 Corruptioners are buying supporters with crazy money-they ALL going into presidency where they can steal enormous sizes-i remind you that Russia got from oil when it was for $100+ barrel almost $4 trillions and all vanished, many suspect that Putin personally sent 3 to Swiss bank

3351 2018-07-23 17:16:34 .
Because the  gave the country back to Iranians a year before and the  was afraid they wouldn't be able to explo their ownit Iran for its oil.

Deposing Mossadeq, the  installed their own puppet, the Shah of Iran.
3352 2018-07-23 17:16:28 But Prince William Sound, Alaska, where the Exxon Valdez poured so much oil is now a huge tourist attarction...... and a major source of US fishing......

Wouldn't that be great? It's not rue of course. And Nova Scotia would be destroyed even more by an oil spill.
3353 2018-07-23 17:16:25 I am assuming Hillary wanted to overthrow Syria for the same reason she overthrew Libya and Egypt. So she and her pay to play partners could get their dirty hands on their oil and natural gas.

3356 2018-07-23 17:16:16 That was Iran money that was dee freeze by the Tresury in oil sales/we pretty much stole it collected interest on it/invested it and when it suited govt interest gave it back/Stop misinformation ;you better than that
3357 2018-07-23 17:16:04 Looking forward to talking about #oil, #Iran, and energy policy on @CNBC @PowerLunch around 230ET @RapidanEnergy
3358 2018-07-23 17:16:00 putin and trump would benefit from war with iran. Russian oil would go up in value AND trump would get a bump as a war time president during midterms! In the meantime, our kids would become targets and "trigger pullers" as Lindsey Graham, obscenely, calls them.
3359 2018-07-23 17:15:59 I wonder, are your senses not sophisticated enough to chose products that compliment your natural odor. Or, are you walking death (bad diet, a mouth full of unfilled cavities, fish oil and garlic pill regime). 
3360 2018-07-23 17:15:50 I forgot to wash the oil off my hands after massaging my mom last night and knocked out.... the scent is so mf strong 
3361 2018-07-23 17:15:48 But oil and gas are going to be traded in dollars for the foreseeable future. The issue is what is physically being traded in local currencies. Can definitely see more growth with online retailer trade too. Definitely important to follow.

3366 2018-07-23 17:15:28 Is publishing broken or "marketing"? Perhaps, the mouth must be forced to talk as fast as the hands create? I know; it's a problem. Moreover, social media offers more faux "send us your money to succeed" offers than real support. Ultimately, it's the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

3375 2018-07-23 17:14:21 Very much cheaper with oil fired boiler. Have one that is fitted outside so no smells or carbon monoxide in house. Can't imagine going onto anything else now. It's not cheap, but then what is!
3376 2018-07-23 17:14:10 WM will never agree to an S30 now.  They only did last time as DC thought it would be a walk in the park. But with support for indy at 50% - nae chance. 
Oil underpins Sterlings value. Without that, post EU England is struggling to pay it's foreign denominated debts.
So no s30
3377 2018-07-23 17:14:07 Honestly it’s actually really cool, my mom won one randomly a couple years ago in a raffle and everything comes out just like as if it was fried minus the grease and oil so you don’t have to feel guilty about eating 50 mozzarella sticks or a bag of fries

3390 2018-07-23 17:13:16 Canada is just as much of an enabler, if not more, to Saudi Arabia than USA. Canada imports billions of dollars worth of oil while bashing our own energy resources. USA is very much dependent on Saudi for their energy needs but wouldn’t be if Canada would wake the fuck up.

3420 2018-07-23 17:10:40 Bet they can smell some oil in there, though. Watch how fast leases go up for auction. Almost as fast as their supporters who love the great outdoors will demonize anyone who calls bullshit.

3432 2018-07-23 17:09:48 Simple question is "Why this contract was given to Pvt company instead of HAL". A pvt company was just formed weeks before to give this deal. We should make our PSU stronger rather than creating a new pvt company. This was done with oil PSUs also to favor a business man friend..
3433 2018-07-23 17:09:46 Yep, China (and Russia) trying to change that though. For example by the new yuan oil contracts, which are then convertable into gold

3437 2018-07-23 17:09:36 Won't a trade deal with the US result in more premature deaths from pollution created by container ships burning heavy oil.  Isn't there an environmental impact of Brexit that is being ignored? - more translocation of marine species in ballast tanks and more deaf whales?

3448 2018-07-23 17:07:55 The reason they are hell bent on environmental protections is 

A. By taking away environmental and animal protection makes it easier for oil drilling

B. Once the government stops making $$$ on fines and ect from environmental protections causes national debit to increase
3449 2018-07-23 17:07:54 An alternative Oil Bourse in anything but USD (EUR, Rouble, Yuan) would be a bigger deal than the tariffs war. Although some rumours have always suggested that Iraq was mustering support for such a move which precipitated Gulf War.

3485 2018-07-23 17:04:16 from the oil company and all the folks who are now unemployed.

3491 2018-07-23 17:03:46 Can you be more specific? Why does the US need 800 foreign military bases, and why does oil need to be paid for in US dollars and what happens to those countries that sell in another currency such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran, and Venezuela?
3492 2018-07-23 17:03:37 Yes, deflection and I wonder if Bolton doesn't have something to do with it. Also, if there's military conflict, the price of oil is sure to rise. I wonder if it benefits Russian gas.

3499 2018-07-23 17:02:51 #FakeNews you can’t just make up stuff and say that’s a theory. Overall inflation affects all sectors. Oil prices are lower than in the past and not rising fast at all
3500 2018-07-23 17:02:48 How can I NOT be angry Greg! by god we’re replacing the gentle flapping of a condors wings with the sound of oil drills and lumber mills! Lord!
3501 2018-07-23 17:02:44 RT @MikeHudema: Here is a map of the oil spills in only the last 5 years. its no wonder people don't want one over their water supply: http…
3502 2018-07-23 17:02:38 One major actor in the realm of climate change is the palm oil industry. Yes it may be cheap, but very harmful for your health and the environment! #BanPalmOil #ClimateChange #FoodIndustry #GHGs
3503 2018-07-23 17:02:26 with baby Trudeau in office no ones gonna buy it as they know Trudeau hates oil and gas industry and after killing off four pipeline projects,  investors are better off investing elsewhere till Trudeau is sent packing
3504 2018-07-23 17:02:06 Is that a "No sh*t Sherlock" news tweet or what? What is the Admiral going to say?: "No, CNBC, after defending the Strait of Hormuz against Soviet Union/Russia for 75 years we suddenly discover Iran can take us."

3505 2018-07-23 17:02:06 I've heard that McD's is very protective of it's oil blend and doesn't allow just anyone to pick up used oil, makes sense to make it into fuel if this is true.
3506 2018-07-23 17:02:03 Anything lavender like lotion or pillow spray or essential oil helps. Take a hot shower before bed. Chamomile tea. Melatonin or zz quil or Benadryl can help you sleep. Reading usually helps me. I hope this helps!
3507 2018-07-23 17:01:58 It doesn't have to be actual war - just the threat of it should send the oil markets into a mini-panic.  They will probably just keep ratcheting up the rhetoric til oil prices rise to where they want them to.  Problem: it just takes one actor on any of the sides it goes boom.
3508 2018-07-23 17:01:53 Try  pure soap (clicks), magnolia tissue oil (pep), drink lots of water. I have very sensitive skin & these have been helpful
3509 2018-07-23 17:01:44 There's a specific shot of an oil tycoon I'm searching for, but every time I think I found it again, it's just Larry Hagman.
3510 2018-07-23 17:01:37 @AriFleischer You guys don't learn anything. How's that regime change working out in Iraq, which is now closer to Iran than just one letter.  If they mine the Straights of Hormuz, we will be paying $200 a barrel for oil.  You people are mentally ill.

3514 2018-07-23 17:01:14 Question, with the price of crude oil falling and has been why is it the price of gasoline as not falling in Broome County and it's amazing the second oil prices rise so does gas prices but it takes mouths  for prices to lower when oil prices lower is this just in Broome County?
3515 2018-07-23 17:00:50 Episode #179 of the SUNDAY WIRE, host Patrick Henningsen speaks to author and global affairs analyst, F. William Engdahl, to discuss his recent article about the new US-Israeli oil wars in the Golan Heights in Syria and how this is connected to the West’s hidden agendas..''
3516 2018-07-23 17:00:49 Why would he arm Ukrainians? Why would he push NATO to spend more on defense? Why would he kill russians in Syria? Why would he criticize Germany IN FRONT OF THE WORLD for buying russian oil? Why would he want the US to produce more oil? Why did he enact sanctions?

Meanwhile the oil company faces import competition from countries with lower cost of doing business because of their country has lower taxes. The USA company moves offshore to protect profits. Less tax revenues are colleted
3525 2018-07-23 17:00:01 The confidence you have is the same confidence I have ,my confidence being am quite sure Chamisa has more people to vote him whereas you are tembaring on your rigging machine that may run put of oil on election day.
3526 2018-07-23 16:59:49 Fun day so far, getting oil change
3527 2018-07-23 16:59:44 Its more oil will go to Russia from Iran if a conflict or war break out between America and Iran...its not a coincidence that within hours of trump and Bolton threatening Iran that both Iran and Moscow are talking OPEC deals
3528 2018-07-23 16:59:42 I’m trying to adjust to new pain meds, but I woke up hurting today. So I’m not sure if they are going to work for me. I think the Dr. is reaching. He told me in all seriousness to try CBD oil w/pot in it to see if it helps my pain. I cldnt believe he said this to me!! He had a Dr
3529 2018-07-23 16:59:32 Here we have an aging, religious zelot, hawking an unproven pain cure, akin to the snake oil products sold in the 1800's. He ought to be ashamed.
3530 2018-07-23 16:59:16 I did pull two big leaves off my plant last night and squeezed them dry! I’ve also rubbed some vitamin E oil all over! I haven’t mixed the three though! 
3531 2018-07-23 16:59:14 @MadMoneyOnCNBC  HOw ERX is related with crude oil price ?
3532 2018-07-23 16:59:11 Yeah, the link specified it’s a map of oil and gas wells in CA. It’s just a screen shot; LA has the largest urban oil field in the country. 580,000 Angelenos live within a quarter mile of an active well. 

@STAND_LA has been doing amazing work  & you should follow them! 
3533 2018-07-23 16:59:01 Omg I lost it at oil pool parties 
3534 2018-07-23 16:58:55 Follow the money....

Oil Prices being down has hurt many economies - the Russians as much as more than anything.

One of the big ? right now with oil is Iran.

Turmoil in/about Iran will drive oil prices up.

Who benefits from that other than the ones hurt by low oil prices?
3535 2018-07-23 16:58:50 Reasonable fear is a part of a justified shooting. This man's fear may have been reasonable it may not have been and also you can't antagonize someone into attacking you so you can shoot them.
3536 2018-07-23 16:58:46 Made a oil change appointment at 11:45. Can still see my truck sitting there not being worked on yet 
3537 2018-07-23 16:58:43 WTI oil $69.13/barrel, +$0.90.
3538 2018-07-23 16:58:42 Trump said that" not taking the oil was a mistake. Maybe we'll have another chance,who knows."
Also, Putin needs that oil to sell to North Korea.

3542 2018-07-23 16:58:23 BJP govt in Jharkhand would pay the premium for PM Crop Insurance Policy, for the state's farmers. Also, will provide them seeds for pulses & oil seeds at subsidized rates.

Instead of paying compensation for families of farmers committing suicide, this is a great alternative!

3549 2018-07-23 16:57:49 tea tree oil works great too!
3550 2018-07-23 16:57:43 The broad shoulders of Westminster abandoned the oil industry and the tax breaks to shell and bp meant the skewed figures of 2015 made it look like oil was finished - and the "Unknown" region tax FPSO-Tanker transfer too. Aye FAR from over 1/2
3551 2018-07-23 16:57:27 Funny how GOP presidents always seem to need to invade the oil rich nations.
3552 2018-07-23 16:57:22 im already knowing I literally had a lil bowl of olive oil that i was using specifically for my boobs. and i aint worn a bra consistently in about 3-4 years

3560 2018-07-23 16:56:52 OH BULLSHIT!!! And you know it!! This is your way of trying to scare the public with lies and deceit! We don't even need their oil! We are rich in oil and natural gas also! So quit trying to cause panic and confusion!
3561 2018-07-23 16:56:47 Girl idk! Lol I just use St. Ives apricot scrub and coconut oil. That’s all. Oh & more peace and less stress.
3562 2018-07-23 16:56:39 @RealCandaceO 100 million barrels of oil a day X 42 Gallons in a barrel X 365 days =1.5 trillion gallons total yearly world production. A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Oil is a minor pollutant compared to forest fires and volcanoes.

3565 2018-07-23 16:56:26 true. very confusing move with the USD. what's your take on crude oil/energy sector? would you consider it the same choppy move with the strength of the dollar?
3566 2018-07-23 16:56:00 Depends how US chooses to attack Iran. Attack and completely destroy Iran’s oil producing capability, leave all their fields and rigs burning and the infrastructure to produce oil utterly destroyed and oil prices wil rise.  Russia wouldn’t necessarily be displease with that.
3567 2018-07-23 16:55:59 @NSAGov George Bush Senior,s attempt to Oppression Governments for personal profits off Mid-Eastern Oil Underground has reflected into Blackmail Budget Spending that has the World endangered to Propaganda War Conflicts to Conceal U.S. Criminals Goals

3576 2018-07-23 16:55:18 Why Iran and not North Korea? War with Iran raises the price of oil and helps Russia!! Has nothing to do with threats or North Korea would be toast!!

t: think of it as olive oil XD
3578 2018-07-23 16:55:15 De hecho siempre nos han dicho eso, que nos separemos which would be terrible for them cuz we have most of the oil lol
3579 2018-07-23 16:55:08 Trump recently got his marching orders in the private meeting he had with Putin.  Start a war with Iran so oil prices spikes through the roof causing the economies of western countries to fail.  Then Russia invades the Baltic countries. Well done, Vladimir.
3580 2018-07-23 16:54:59 ha ha. Tea tree oil will burn off actinic keratoses, though. It hurts and it take a long time. But it actually works. (My dermatologist admits it after she's seen what I did to mine!)

3586 2018-07-23 16:54:01 Does anyone else get super bad anxiety when driving over the hole to get your oil changed
3587 2018-07-23 16:53:56 As a tax payer funding the army in have every right to speak out about "veterans". It's not out of spite. I'd never walk that walk. I'd rather face prison. The concept of killing innocent men women children, destroying and poisoning their lands, enabling the looting of their oil?
3588 2018-07-23 16:53:45 Try a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar with a dusting of fresh cracked pepper as a dip for your bread.
3589 2018-07-23 16:53:43 Ah yeah, maybe that’s why street food sellers often slice lots of lines on catfish’s body to prevent it from too much popping? If we fry by ourselves we just tuang it to the hot oil hahaha
3590 2018-07-23 16:53:41 My folks use to call comments like this “Snake Oil Salesmen” How exactly do you get “free” education? Do the Professors work for free? How do you build the buildings and how do you maintain them? Nothing is free! Quit playing all of us as fools! Fix immigration laws. Good Start!

3597 2018-07-23 16:52:41 Oil companies are literally burning us into extinction..
3598 2018-07-23 16:52:37 Threats against Iran are foolish and ill-considered. Iran's leaders could-if they want-close the Strait of Hormuz in a heartbeat and there is nothing, short of all-out war, that the U.S. could do to stop them. Think what that oil disruption would do to western economies, #Iran
3599 2018-07-23 16:52:34 I usually do my own oil changes but I don't really have the space and so I've decided to go go Valvoline and it's taking 5ever and I'm bleh

3601 2018-07-23 16:52:16 Interesting that the poverty rate in Alaska is much lower than the rest of the nation. I'm assuming the Permanent Fund dividend (essentially a universal basic income funded by oil money) plays a big role there.

Bill,
If you read the 4FISA apps, you'll see mention of Sept. 23, 2016 news article.  
If you read 9/23/2016 news articles on Carter Page, you'll read articles mention: Carter Page adviser to the Kremlin via Russia's State-Owned Oil Company, Gazprom.

Now I have a Q for you...
3611 2018-07-23 16:51:27 Just came to get a simple oil change and somehow I’m leaving after paying $73...  They got my ass
3612 2018-07-23 16:51:27 Perspective:  AND this about the time that Russia inks a nonaggression pact with Iran , re pre WW2 w/Hitler, allowing them to close the Hormuz Straights, really screwing up the world's oil supply!  Thoughts?
3613 2018-07-23 16:51:24 Back in 1984 when I used to oil the lanes. We didn’t have no buttons to push.  In fact we used the oil to protect the wood. So much has changed.
3614 2018-07-23 16:51:23 Eeeh yaaa, so sorry o.

3617 2018-07-23 16:51:05 Oil prices could top $120 before year-end. Oil prices have lost more than 8% this month, but investors should be aware that a roughly 40% spike from last week’s levels to more than $100 is possible this year.
3618 2018-07-23 16:51:04 Isn’t the oil on the side of your nose chemically the same thing?  Doesn’t watchmakers use this to oil tiny gears.
3619 2018-07-23 16:51:03 isnt this supposed to be oil

3622 2018-07-23 16:50:50 The threats did not start with Iran threatening the US. It is the US that is threatening Iran and has done since 1979 when the US/UL installed Shah was kicked out bu ordinary Iranians. The US has never forgiven the Iranians because access to its oil was now in Iranian hands!

3626 2018-07-23 16:50:15 Hot compress, baking soda, rubbing alchohol. Tea tree oil and wrap it up.
3627 2018-07-23 16:49:41 Do we need say more about how those losing grip of it,are determined to rubbish the good deeds of PMB? Water and oil will find it's level within short time.
3628 2018-07-23 16:49:39 Under orders from Putin. Disrupt the production of Iranian oil and gas (3rd and 5th largest producer of oil and gas) by means of escalation of tensions and eventual war to drive up world prices and enrich Russia.

3629 2018-07-23 16:49:38 Hahaha tinuturuan ako ni ken kung pano mag luto ahha tas tawag nya sa oil is madalas sa kamay na nasa bote pOTa HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA antagal ko mafigure out na oil pala yung sinasabi nya na madulas sa kamay hayop HAHAHAHAHHAHA
3630 2018-07-23 16:49:38 Russia wins by copping oil fields and warm water port or it don't happe
3631 2018-07-23 16:49:33 •Exfoliate your lips a few times a week

•Apply honey to your lips! 

•Apply cayenne pepper / cinnamon to lips

•Peppermint essential oil is a really good option to get plump lips!
3632 2018-07-23 16:49:30 Yeah, that's how it's described in the book; it just seemed that splashing water on something right in front of you shouldn't be handled the same as throwing a flask of oil across a room or shooting a bow. It may have nerfed the final boss, but I was okay with how it played out.
3633 2018-07-23 16:49:25 Gonna start boxing and oil painting really soon, and i’m so excited wallah! Trying to keep my mind off some things, and getting myself busy as much as possible.
3634 2018-07-23 16:49:24 To all those oil barron run media outlets and ass hat journalists who are picking on Tesla, Go **** Yourselves. 

Yours Divinely,
St Jude.
3635 2018-07-23 16:49:17 Let's see if we can figure this out:
Trump goes to Russia @realDonaldTrump #Putin
Out of the blue, Pompeo attacks Iran in a speech @SecPompeo 
Iran counters #Iran
Trump threatens Iran
Oil prices go up
Russia gets most of its money from oil
Hummm?

3637 2018-07-23 16:49:11 It’s not a diversionary tactic; it’s an attempt to upset the oil market, raise prices and please Putin. Very obvious ploy!!
3638 2018-07-23 16:49:07 State-owned oil marketing company, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), is investing nearly ₹12,000 crore in West Bengal for laying an LPG pipeline, shoring up capacity at Haldia and upgrading fuel quality.
3639 2018-07-23 16:49:06 If trump wants your oil Iran he will just take it, and no amount of shoe throwing will stop that 
3640 2018-07-23 16:49:01 Except for applying the factor 50 , I can’t see the problem? When I went to Yugoslavia for my honeymoon many years ago , there were loads of nuddy beaches , and no oil paintings on them
3641 2018-07-23 16:48:48 They have so much oil. Try eating your oil!!
3642 2018-07-23 16:48:43 Mr President, could it be time for a joint exercise with South Korea and US Navy watching out for oil smuggling from China & Russia to N Korea?
3643 2018-07-23 16:48:40 mixin up oil, had arthritis by da mo’ninnn
3644 2018-07-23 16:48:31 @POTUS & Putin have discussed that scam for a long time now (Per Guardian) as way 4 @realdonaldtrump to pay back some of his considerable Russian debt by paving way for Russia to take over Iran oil production. I bet ol' Rex Tillerson could offer some insight on this deadly scheme
3645 2018-07-23 16:48:31 Love the properties of sea buckthorn oil. What a delightful giveaway  #StretchMarks #Skincare
3646 2018-07-23 16:48:29 Sabes como NORUEGA paso de no ser petrolero originalmente para ser quizás la empresa petrolera(STAT OIL)más rentable deMUNDO
3647 2018-07-23 16:48:21 統計やって風呂入って寝る
3648 2018-07-23 16:48:14 Doing fine over here in EastTn. Come over, we have to many jobs. Trump is smart enough to take the oil,unlike everyone else. If Reagan had dealt with this 1980,imagine the world today.  So you boys are calling for Hillary then. Who, who could handle the onslaught but Trump, who?
3649 2018-07-23 16:48:00 JUST ONCE I would like to get my oil changed without the people trying to sell me like 16 different things that need to be done to my car.
3650 2018-07-23 16:47:57 olive oil, sprinkle with lemon pepper.  bake in the oven.
3651 2018-07-23 16:47:55 if oil will cost 200 dollars per barel, China and India will be very upset about it.They are biggest consumers of foreign oil.
3652 2018-07-23 16:47:55 Could you say that to Putin? Because he has been attacking our country for years and you don’t seem to mind.Also,I’m thinking this is all about oil and you want the USA to get their oil from Putin somlets piss  th ent att of the world. It’s not going to happen. Putin is our enemy
3653 2018-07-23 16:47:54 Sentiment will be dire that's for sure. Expect sp to recover somewhat but not beyond current levels until after Wild Horse results.
Block XX has a decent CoS and I expect them to find oil there after all the blocks are analogous to the ones over the border..
3654 2018-07-23 16:47:47 I know. You had that right back last week who gave away that penalty. Definitely need to sell your club to an oil sheikh.
3655 2018-07-23 16:47:45 Btw the whole tweet was a joke. I'd never sit out in the sun with baby oil on, I'm naturally olive skinned and not white as a loaf of bread. You tried though.
3656 2018-07-23 16:47:44 ok, so what happens now, same oil stuff nothing is ever done to liberals
3657 2018-07-23 16:47:40 Nge-coconut oil
3658 2018-07-23 16:47:36 He discovered us like crude oil. 
3659 2018-07-23 16:47:35 "This oil slick in the ocean makes some interesting rainbowy patterns too!"
3660 2018-07-23 16:47:28 He’s serious alright. Putin’s directive was to raise the price of oil at all costs!! War with Iran is the easiest way to raise the price of oil and secretly continue to do Putin’s bidding!!  AMERICA wake up...
3661 2018-07-23 16:47:28 #45 don't want manufacturers to make cars efficient. That in turn makes vehicles use more fuel, makes a profit for big oil
3662 2018-07-23 16:47:28 It’s a Thai BBQ+hot pot kinda thing! You oil the grill in the middle with typically lard and the oil drips into the side which is where the hot pot is. Super unhealthy but tasty  (or gross if you don’t like that kinda stuff haha)
3663 2018-07-23 16:47:26 I’m sure you have done your homework, but just in case, keep in mind that Ortega controls all the powers of government (including judicial), police, armed forces, parallel and official budgets, municipalities, import of oil, energy...he’s solely responsible for the turmoil.
3664 2018-07-23 16:47:21 Lets be realistic, we are not a team with the cash to match the ambition! Until we find some rich oil baron wanting to plough money into us, we need to take the best we can find, and at the minute, Vernam is a decent option!
3665 2018-07-23 16:47:17 Looool!! The joke is there was one time this year my beard looked more full because I didn’t shape it up ‘after’ I got a fade. My barber was saying it’s more of a natural look. But now I’m using an aloe vera, olive oil and some castor oil concoction.
3666 2018-07-23 16:47:09 Got to wonder how many anti oil groups share the same poll information.   Groups like Desmog Camp cloud Greenpeace Seirra club
3667 2018-07-23 16:47:05 Anyone use an oil diffuser they recommend ?
3668 2018-07-23 16:47:03 Trump's War of Words With Ant Hive Mind Shines Spotlight on Vital Oil Route
3669 2018-07-23 16:46:50 they are concerned about barrier exploitation oil. Europe can bring some solace
3670 2018-07-23 16:46:50 "The squeaky wheel gets the oil."
~ @AprilDRyan
3671 2018-07-23 16:46:48 Was what I said incorrect and not true facts? Their money from oil sales 40 years ago was stored in European banks, the funds were frozen due to the UN and US sanctions. When sanctions were lifted they were legally allowed to take their money. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
3672 2018-07-23 16:46:16 IV been saying this all along  it is ridiculous that the media focus on anything else #ITSALLABOUTTHEMONEYBOYS  Trump is not actually as wealthy as he pretends & his entire goal is to make money from the Russian oil lake Tillerson & Exxon assisted in finding sanctions stop him
3673 2018-07-23 16:46:12 You're all deluded by the number. Hell, my Camargo can do over 200mph. Was this "hyperloop" test done in a pulled down vacuum, inside a rusty tube? Or just some e-car on a rail in the desert. I love tech, but, the Hyperloop is Hype. Snake oil salesmanship w/ego+.
3674 2018-07-23 16:46:08 How do you take it? I do coconut oil, honey and a little half and half. Yum!
3675 2018-07-23 16:46:00 Most of new US shale oil has some inconvenient API, will be just good to oversupply the gasoline market and useless for making distillates!

3678 2018-07-23 16:45:47 once i get the oil changed in my 04 honda accord it’s over for u ho’s
3679 2018-07-23 16:45:43 10 African countries rely on a single product for the bulk (at least  three-quarters) of export revenues. For eight of these, that single  product is crude oil, except in the case of Eritrea (copper ores; 93.7%)  and Guinea-Bissau (cashew nuts; 75%) ~AfDB (C Mungai)
3680 2018-07-23 16:45:40 Not too shabby, just finishing up a wonderful lunch.  A freshly caught herb crusted chilled bit of tuna a top fresh Romain and greens with an olive oil and fresh lemons drizzle. Yummy!
3681 2018-07-23 16:45:26 WP reports rather than accept a report which favored protecting federal land. Trump would rather rape the land by oil & logging interest. Next time there a wild fire we all know who to blame. Is this How u MAGA
3682 2018-07-23 16:45:25 Ok so never put coconut oil in ur coffee on ice
3683 2018-07-23 16:45:23 20% from a very low base!  Low oil prices shouldn't be the catalyst for economic growth.  Oil equities still have not recovered much from multi-year lows.  Oil gains should stabilize energy companies and improve investment, wage growth and jobs in the sector.
3684 2018-07-23 16:45:21 Ion need that I def need that castor oil
3685 2018-07-23 16:45:17 Damn i need an oil change and new bresk pads
3686 2018-07-23 16:45:15 I love to engage with my community! I sent 929 tweets to 343 people in the past 8 days. How engaged are you? Great Job Everyone..

Yesterday had the oil change at Pennzoil in Bend on corner of 3rd st and Wilson they did a great job.
3687 2018-07-23 16:45:11 Well cancel all gas and oil rebates. Be informed before being condescending. Why should I pay for a pipeline full of dirty fuel nobody wants.
3688 2018-07-23 16:45:10 Tea tree oil is the cure all.
3689 2018-07-23 16:45:10 If you have oil build up in between facial washings, use a medicated pad or blotting paper to remove excess oil. These products have the added benefit of being portable, allowing you to freshen up your face no matter where you are.
3690 2018-07-23 16:45:06 Being a Chemical Engineering graduate, AND petroleum OIL BEING one of the main processes we deal with, FrancieRobin Enterprises invests in majority shares of  any North Pole and South Pole Oil depositories discoveries. FrancieRobin Enterprises is also aware of Environmental
3691 2018-07-23 16:45:04 One of my favorite customers just called me and asked me how I’m doing. Which was kinda strange since we had talked early this morning. He ordered 3 cases of oil and I keyed in 12 cases.  I literally laughed until I cried. #oopsie #toldyouineededmorecoffee #worklife
3692 2018-07-23 16:45:02 いままで腐乱臭がする絵はDMだったからなぁ～・・・あとは渋とかねーっ
3693 2018-07-23 16:45:00 How else are you going to get chunky oil based paint off your face?
3694 2018-07-23 16:44:39 Y’all tomorrow is the big day I’m going to an Oil Rig and I’m terrified 
3695 2018-07-23 16:44:36 スクショの闇に飲まれよ
3696 2018-07-23 16:44:21 Remember, brother, when the United States advances, the world also advances ... humanity too. Without oil and medicine, it would be possible, humanity advanced through the use of oil in its many virtues.
3697 2018-07-23 16:44:13 Abeg he should keep quiet. What does he know?
3698 2018-07-23 16:44:13 While I do get my share of strange e-mails, this one from "KUSA" caught my attention: "Jim, You are needed in an Oil Base Plant in North America." No further details were offered.
3699 2018-07-23 16:44:10 Don’t forget to swing by tomorrow to our South Burnaby branch to get Vaccum pump’s oil changed, at no cost.  It starts at 7am
3700 2018-07-23 16:44:02 Also, the world doesn't only get oil from Saudi, but the entire Gulf
3701 2018-07-23 16:43:51 おやすみです～
3702 2018-07-23 16:43:43 Yea clean off the residue with hot water and salt and dry it and apply veggie oil around it to keep it “seasoned”
3703 2018-07-23 16:43:42 But fish have stuff like fish oil, omega 3 and natural salt compared to beef or chicken that’s been on a non natural diet and pumped full of water, it makes tons of sense why people only eat fish
3704 2018-07-23 16:43:38 Shortening my brand back down to Candles,All Natural Scented Oils For Oil Burners,Room Sprays And Some Other Stuff.. Legit going to work the hell out of this and then branch out into other products
3705 2018-07-23 16:43:36 I'm thinking a selective oil blockade in the gulf on US ships will be coming shortly, and half the US navy will end up tied up there, with the rest of the P5+1 giggling...
3706 2018-07-23 16:43:35 Hard to get good CBD Oil in the UK.
Lots of shit about in the market
3707 2018-07-23 16:43:28 Rain is 1b to Eucalyptus oil being 1a for me
3708 2018-07-23 16:43:26 I guess headlines are what excites algos. A quick drop shortly after that headline.. can’t figure out how relevant it is to oil price tho.
3709 2018-07-23 16:43:26 添
3710 2018-07-23 16:43:18 The demand will always be there, indeed. But the amount consumed will decline in the long term, as transportation transitions to other energy sources. Given this, it's hard to imagine that nations will want sub standard bitumen based oil

3714 2018-07-23 16:42:51 You checked the oil right after they changed it?
3715 2018-07-23 16:42:49 by threatening to close the strait of Hormuz yes, as the world needs oil.but not long ago DONALD also threatened to wipe Nkorea of the map, he is a bully as well.
3716 2018-07-23 16:42:38 I still got the Ya Wey oil on canvas as the background on my phone. Fight me.
3717 2018-07-23 16:42:38 No, he did NOT place the hardest sanctions on Iran, NOW. 
He gave them time to prepare by postponing the oil sanction until after the US election. 
THAT tells you about priorities.
3718 2018-07-23 16:42:34 The #zoo Nigeria murderous Govt paid #ICC with crude oil money to evade arrest & #Buhari & his prosecution. So sad indeed.
3719 2018-07-23 16:42:33 So, Trump and gang are working for Russia and oil/gas execs.
3720 2018-07-23 16:42:29 The heck is America going to do to iran send troops to find oil... oops I meant “weapons of mass destruction”
3721 2018-07-23 16:42:27 The Russian economy = corruption and graft. Intnl sanctions have crippled low-level Putin allies in Russia. The need to launder their vast illegal profits overseas. Trump Org is only one of 1000s of complicit US companies. There’s also the Crimean oil terminals in Black Sea.
3722 2018-07-23 16:42:08 Beautiful morning shots I took on location of my latest film, East Texas Oil, here just outside of Calgary, Alberta.

3723 2018-07-23 16:42:05 Do u find it cheaper on oil charlie ? We r about to convert barn n was thinking of putting oil tank in rather than gas.

3728 2018-07-23 16:41:32 DOG OWNERS! What do you feed your dogs? My dog eats a special dry food for sensitive skin which is rich in Omega oil, and I'll give him fresh snacks. But I can't help but wonder....is it not a bit crap eating the same thing daily lol. Do dogs mind, like I'd be a lil annoyed.
3729 2018-07-23 16:41:31 Plus any change in the fuel efficiency takes years to implement and we are all trading oil for the next 1-3 months.
3730 2018-07-23 16:41:29 @realDonaldTrump someone just called from Chicago Il - 312-725-0177 - TO TEXAS, selling Marijuana Oil! What the heck is going on that Companies are calling to DEAL DRUGS? PLEASE make this stop!

3732 2018-07-23 16:41:27 Those which are sweet and medium sweet. Also it depends on the refineries technologies. But what about those refineries that depends on heavy and sour crude oil? Do they have a good luck for benefiting from this opportunity?
3733 2018-07-23 16:41:26 rasa nak sapu je bio oil kat muka tapi teringat dam kata nanti muka lagi berminyak hm takpelah

3735 2018-07-23 16:41:19 Cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes with Apple cider vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper is a staple in my household.

3737 2018-07-23 16:40:59 What kind of inks do you use on fabrics..water based or oil based!
3738 2018-07-23 16:40:56 Is there a food that you regularly sniff not to check freshness, but simply for the joy the aroma brings you?

Anytime I open the jar of coconut oil my nose goes directly over it and I take the biggest inhale I can. My DH does the same thing with new jars of peanut butter.
3739 2018-07-23 16:40:56 I choose to eat foods made with simple ingredients. 

Lays chips: potatoes, oil, salt
3740 2018-07-23 16:40:53 Looking to buy #oil
3741 2018-07-23 16:40:45 Even more important is the proximity of the long-coveted Caspian Sea oil fields to both Iran and Russia. See this first, then you will understand why the US military surrounds both nations. A war for the Caspian oil fields has been on the drawing board for more than 40 years.
3742 2018-07-23 16:40:42 A polluting oil company with a track record of spills and accidents has no business in Alameda County.  @Keith_Carson @Scott_Haggerty @Nate_Miley it’s time to protect our health and safety, not oil company profits. Plz vote to deny E&B's permit + #ProtectLivermore
3743 2018-07-23 16:40:38 Creo que tuvimos bastante con el ejemplo del Derrame del Golfo... Hablo de el deep oil spill de Cheney... Y la trinchera de PR es mucho mas profunda,
Si acaso sería en el Caribe (q es llano),pero aparentemente no han detectado mucho... ya veríamos las Plataformas en el horizonte
3744 2018-07-23 16:40:29 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
3745 2018-07-23 16:40:16 OR, Iran's OIL is the reason Trump is in WH. 
Latest events just hurried it up.
No more wars for oil by Greedy Old bastards.

3752 2018-07-23 16:40:03 I use stuff like rose water & witch hazel after every time I wash my face. Really helps control oil/breakouts, your face is super smooth, smaller pores, etc. Plus it smells amazing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3759 2018-07-23 16:39:19 Make no mistake, trump and Putin made their plan for the middle east. They want the oil! It has been Putin's plan all along.
3760 2018-07-23 16:39:18 What's worse than Nixon is the FISA abuse that is now made clear. 2) What has Trump done to "service" Russia? I'll wait. Was it the sanctions? Expulsions? Bombing of Putin's ally? Killing Russian oil? Arming Putin's enemies? Your theory doesn't hold water.
3761 2018-07-23 16:39:08 Of course this administration would dismiss key benefits to the actual public on this move. It might hurt the oil drilling and fracking businesses.
3762 2018-07-23 16:39:07 They need people to help pack their crocs and "I hate America" posters
3763 2018-07-23 16:39:02 Ms Hotspur, you seem to presume cannabis damages health.  It does not.  Even smoking it  (without tobacco) does not cause lung damage.  It is actually used in Europe to treat asthma!  It can be used in many ways, smoking is only one method.  Lots of med' users take drops of oil.
3764 2018-07-23 16:38:43 そういうこと言ってくれる人がいるってかなりいいことなのよ～（大人の対応）それにふぁぼRTとか反応あった方が描いててモチベーションになるしねっ

3769 2018-07-23 16:38:15 It's a no-brainer to perceive a long steep gradient of petrol prices increase. Trump and Iran feud to cause an even more shortage of oil supply

Not only did they divide Europe, the USSR also provided Hitler with vast amounts of oil , metals and minerals up to 1941..
3783 2018-07-23 16:37:32 Fuck these endless wars.  I hope the EU puts sanctions on the Trump Organization for breaking the deal along with any US oil company and Defense contractors that participates in this nonsense.

3791 2018-07-23 16:36:46 I don't think so. I think Putin has hinted at shares of Russian gas/oil companies for him if he can just get those pesky sanctions removed. He'll  hang around for the $$$.
3792 2018-07-23 16:36:21 To me this is what is happening,first off #POTUS didn’t write that tweet,some of his cowardly boasting but this is all #StephenMiller.Get rid of our allies,start a war with Iran Putin comes in and “help” us and voila! So that’s the closed meeting. Remember he said take the oil!

3794 2018-07-23 16:36:16 If you threaten it, you will have to help, help Iran compares your oil. To make a big America again you will need 50% of the oil you can buy. But to change the world 50% of world oil.
3795 2018-07-23 16:36:11 A couple of drone strikes on their water infrastructure dams and they will be done for they can't drink oil.  Very  little cost to complete mission.

3797 2018-07-23 16:35:55 the liberals fully expect Trump to bomb Iran.  Boosts poll numbers and raises oil prices for Putin.
3798 2018-07-23 16:35:53 @NM_NickNocturne just got caught up on the live stream. Going with the curse thing, the perfume smell coming out of the coffee can could have been some oil the papers were annointed with to curse it
3799 2018-07-23 16:35:41 You may have some cred, FoS, If you  were not a US oil funded lobby group pretending to be a grassroots group.  You group is a fraud, allied with the disgraced @cfib, funder if @OntarioPCParty fronts.
3800 2018-07-23 16:35:33 Yes.  Trump's team has been working on a plan to instigate a soft coup in Iran since day one.  It's no coincidence that Iran's oil purchasers have suddenly decided to buy from Saudi Arabia and the Rial is collapsing.

3810 2018-07-23 16:34:51 hadn't you heard the rumor Putin gets Crimea, Trump gets to bomb Iran (boosting midterm poll numbers).  Oil prices go higher, benefits Russia and US fossil fuel donor class.  seems reasonable to me.

3816 2018-07-23 16:34:12 I think this is a ploy to boost oil prices for Russia on Putin’s request

3867 2018-07-23 16:29:35 Sanctions imposed on Iran included restrictions on banking. Iran had sold, and delivered,oil to several countries,China, India, Japan, and South Korea.  But they were NEVER payed for the oil, so the money was kept in banks, as sanctions were lifted they were paid, not TAXPAYER $$
3868 2018-07-23 16:29:35 I'm officially switching to Red Lion after your videos about their olive oil choice.
3869 2018-07-23 16:29:33 It would need a few modifications to avoid blasting exhaust and oil in your face.

It's definitely not suitable as a handheld fan. Those exhausts get very hot and tend to shoot fire at unpredictable intervals...

3871 2018-07-23 16:29:29 Do you know who has light tight oil right now? Junex energy does. Its not economic yet, but by 2022 it will be. That is why Utica wants to buy them right now and just amended the offer today. Check out Junex before they get picked off.

3878 2018-07-23 16:28:49 Ain't it just more propaganda for unionists.... Kevin Hague whom I knew as a lad on Islay should know better... he's not totally stupid but has no qualifications as far as I know to spout economics
Confident Snake Oil salesman is right 
3879 2018-07-23 16:28:46 Pipeline proponents should look into why the UAE and other oil giants are investing heavily in tourism, and why many oil-rich nations and fossil fuel companies are increasingly pouring money into electric utilities and renewables. 

The winds are changing. Bitumen is out.
3880 2018-07-23 16:28:44 most conservatives know it’s an actual thing, but acknowledging that would cut their funds from oil companies, and making money is top priority

Heavy Oil becomes the only alt. option to bring price down. 
Refineries that can't handle heavy oil go bust. Diesel spikes. Trade slows.
Heavy Oil is the new economy. Argentina is now very RICH!
3886 2018-07-23 16:27:54 Yeah forgot to mention China Not as an ally but as one they need to settle the dispute wit, Cause atm Iran is just partnering up with china/russia. And the oil will never be an issue in terms of market IMO as Iran will in "worst case" Sell it off much cheaper to some 3rd parties?

3901 2018-07-23 16:26:38 All Trump's angry twites are due to US fear of weakening #USD as Iran was first who adopted USD-free oil trade, later on, followed by Russia and China. #StopMeddlingInIran

3913 2018-07-23 16:25:48 Even for you Murphy, this is low.  Do you really think that Iranian threats to cut off oil supplies out of the Persian Gulf and threats to the USA of the "mother of all wars" are a phony crisis?  Don't you care about the security of the USA?  Just for once, stop the politics.

3916 2018-07-23 16:25:22 @realDonaldTrump Don't let the girls keep u from doing what needs to be done. President Rouhani is a thug, ruling through fear and intimidation, and keeping his citizens poor while the rich get richer selling oil.

Try using it as an alternative to mayo on a sandwich or creamy dressings on salads, or pair with fresh veggies for a snack!
3923 2018-07-23 16:24:59 What happens IF; Ghawar, has 30-55% water, declined at 8% from 2004-2014 and Ghawars 96% (80%+16%) rate of decline increases shows up by March 2019 to an alarming point, sets off alarm bells ringing all over the oil world because Ghawar can't keep up this capacity?

Because it's Monday & that's part of the game plan of the Deep State's HFT War on commodities The victims are investors, farmers, oil producers, miners.

3927 2018-07-23 16:24:23 Nope,your wrong,why do you think WM has labelled it (non-area)?and speaking of 'theft',where did/has the £300 billion of oil money since it was able to be extracted,gone?certainly not been spent in Scotland.

Finally, whilst Norway does (I think) have a sov wealth fund isn’t it because they managed North Sea oil proceeds better than U.K.governments of all parties?

3933 2018-07-23 16:23:42 Big surprise the corrupt Netanyahu praises his puppet Trump for doing his dirty work. You want the US to blow Iran into the stone ages so you can run a pipeline straight to Israel and steal there oil. God will punish you for your war crimes.

3941 2018-07-23 16:23:14 I apologise on my previous reply. This is a scripted response that probably came from his 2 hours with Putin! He wants to act tough, force the blockade of the Persian Gulf, drive up the price of Oil & help his Master Putin out. Russia will posture on the other side to prolong it.

3943 2018-07-23 16:22:56 deranged donnie threatens Iran...really?  it's not N. Korea you stupid asshat!you are playing with fire and oil...SOMEONE BETTER STOP HIM
3944 2018-07-23 16:22:49 Update for those trying to follow : 

- Iran has nukes they won’t give up. 
- Iran has one of highest oil export in Middle East 
-Trump is getting all country’s to stop buying oil by #Nov4th 
-Iran threatened us with “war of all wars” if trump did this.
3945 2018-07-23 16:22:46 Trump's reckless rhetoric on Iran raises the price of oil which in turn causes higher gas prices for consumers.
3946 2018-07-23 16:22:41 When do we get to stop fighting the Saudis' wars? When they've eliminated all the "wrong-sort" of Muslims? Oil and religion: an ugly unctuous deadly mixture.
3947 2018-07-23 16:22:35 All this oil and you couldn't afford an iron?

3950 2018-07-23 16:22:09 Oil recently dropped from $71 to $67 per Barrel! No drop in gas prices in California! Vote Cox people of California to get rid of the gas tax! Demorats in California are killing the middle class! 
3951 2018-07-23 16:22:06 Are we invading Iran for oil?!
3952 2018-07-23 16:22:02 Iraq has a single commodity economy of "Oil" which in itself is a disaster. Add to that that within the state there is a well established war economy and corrupted, organized networks, of government officials and business community is engaged in. 1/2
3953 2018-07-23 16:22:00 Black folks buy one bottle of cooking oil and make that shit last a lifetime
3954 2018-07-23 16:21:58 Our government brought in all of that against the native americans on Indian land over a foreign oil pipeline. Guess who won, yeah the pipe line was built after tear gas, water hoses, white north west militia, trump got paid for that thing, its poisoning the water.
3955 2018-07-23 16:21:50 Also bear in mind that our new pal over in Russia would really like to sell us his oil.
3956 2018-07-23 16:21:49 @cvpayne Doesn’t Iran have huge oil reserves? Yet, it wants nuclear power for domestic uses? Why does the issue get any farther than that ridiculous assertion?
3957 2018-07-23 16:21:45 I use coconut oil the way the dad from My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses Windex lmao
3958 2018-07-23 16:21:39 Eish...oil neh, it always boils down to the oil!
3959 2018-07-23 16:21:25 自分で耳掃除するのすごい寂しいなーって
3960 2018-07-23 16:21:25 trump probably told him that if he kept his mouth shut about Russia, he could have Iran to pester. Putin would like that too, make oil prices go higher.
3961 2018-07-23 16:21:22 Also. As far as my memory goes, we don't have an official GoI statement on cutting oil imports. + the general feeling a lot of us seem to get is this American dictation of Indian foreign policy, which is not pleasant. If Turkey can continue maintaining oil imports, India also can
3962 2018-07-23 16:21:16 Trudeau once again using 4.8 Billion tax dollars to buy kinder Morgan pipe line as if it is his own money. If the tax payers of this country are going to own an oil pipeline , don't you think we should get much lower gas prices ? Trudeau Liberals are  in it for themselves.
3963 2018-07-23 16:21:13 Random fact: Grapeseed oil is the by product of wine making. Who knew?
3964 2018-07-23 16:21:12 @realDonaldTrump what’s the deal Trump. What was the secret meeting with Russia? How about the fact that Russia has oil and wants to sell it on the world market. They want sanctions lifted. Trump wants to put sanctions back on Iran so they can’t sell oil. Their livelihood.

3967 2018-07-23 16:20:56 ‘Do you want me to sort out those green beans for you?’ 
NO! No I don’t. 
Deliberately cooking them differently to how she suggested (olive oil, garlic, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon).

3972 2018-07-23 16:20:22 Oh, I forgot the oil is worthless. 
Glad Westminster take the burden of the tax revenues away from us...

izzy: oh.
3974 2018-07-23 16:20:11 Because he lied to you   You keep lying to "We the People."

Putin controls KJU.  Gazacrom, his son's pipeline company, wants a South Korean pipeline for Putin's oil company.  

You're just the puppet and "actor."

4012 2018-07-23 16:17:18 Wisdom from an Old Man; This is the best way to prepare kale. Heat two table spoons of oil in a non-stick frying pan – 15 seconds. Add the kale and cook down until one half of the volume -- about five minutes. Then scrape into garbage. Add quinoa if you like.

4019 2018-07-23 16:16:59 Norway have a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund because they decided to invest the returns from oil. The UK, by contrast, decided to use the money for temporary tax cuts.

—#Tariff  forcing Corps to move off shore, increasing consumer prices of #Autos
—lifting #EPA regulations allowing pollution of land, water, air
4026 2018-07-23 16:16:37 Since trump's tweet on Iran, 
oil has gone up 37 cents.
4027 2018-07-23 16:16:35 I have an oil change at 230, then an Apple appt at 4
4028 2018-07-23 16:16:32 Bet Scott Pruitt was and Andrew Wheeler is now gleefully cackling seeing the habitat destruction. Visions of oil drilling after raping nature dancing in their little pointed heads. Baby Trump was touching himself vigorously dreaming of murdering the orangutan. Shitheads
4029 2018-07-23 16:16:32 DONALD TRUMP IS DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM. 
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO PLAY THIS MONEY, OIL, NATURAL RESOURCES, TERRORISM AND WEAPONS GAME?

Burgan in Kuwait which produces 1 million barrels per day 
Da Qing in China which produces 1 million barrels per day. 

Ghawar, which produces 4.5 million barrels per day, 
YES, Ghawar affects the PRICE of OIL
4035 2018-07-23 16:15:42 The media covertly reaches out the WH staff for quotes.  The fact that your WH leaks are worse than an oil leak, is nobody's fault but your own.  Why would the media ask you anything in a serious manner, when all you do is #LIE to protect yourself and your businesses. #Impeach45

4037 2018-07-23 16:15:39 The reason why the opposite is happening is because of ambiguity in policy. We had an Iranian and an American delegation visiting Delhi to put forth their cases. This is not just about oil. Let's note Chhabahar is in the pipeline. India can't afford to upset Iran.
4038 2018-07-23 16:15:35 That’s what big oil wants you to believe. Wake up, sheeple

4040 2018-07-23 16:15:30 I think #philhogan is right. A
 good start would be for #Europe to start buying #Iranian oil in Euro.
#Trumpovich must understand that he's not the leader of the free world anymore, Europes leader now leads the world and need to excerise this power.

4046 2018-07-23 16:14:49 Whoever controls Iran’s oil would control Iran’s economic future. Which is why they voted to kick BP out of controlling their oil in the ‘50’s. I think this is a power play by the US and it’s allies, Netanyahu possibly, to weaken Iran’s standing in the region.
4047 2018-07-23 16:14:45 Jake’s dad is the absolute best. He fixed my car, changed my Oil, And cleaned my car while I was at work. I am so blessed to have him in my life.
4048 2018-07-23 16:14:39 Not just as a distraction. Russia would benefit from a war with Iran in the oil sector.

4053 2018-07-23 16:14:23 Do you by any chance happen to have the slightest idea of the ratio of Energy produced by Oil vs. Solar Panels?

4055 2018-07-23 16:14:17 I started putting tea tree oil in my shampoo and it’s truly changed my life. I’ll put 5 drops in one pump of no sulfate/silicone free shampoo. Then let it sit for like 10 minutes. It feels like your scalp is covered in mint tbh lol.

4061 2018-07-23 16:13:26 Shame on you Green Party FL for promoting this pro-Ortega fake news. Ortega is no friend of green energy as he is in bed with oil refineries in Nicaragua and the Neoliberals would support Ortega since he is a globalist socialist.

4075 2018-07-23 16:12:04 Looks like oil
4076 2018-07-23 16:11:48 But setting that aside, I was referring to Billy's insinuation that there could be a sinister manipulated sudden rise in oil prices just before the election. That's just not possible for a single entity to do. Basically all the oil producers in the world would have to coordinate.
4077 2018-07-23 16:11:45 Just Like Tillerson was put in place to lift sanctions on an Exxon/Russia oil deal, Pompeo's sole purpose is to drum up support for a war with Iran. Yay.

4082 2018-07-23 16:11:00 Did you hedge your exposed position on the oil used in he dressing? That’s the question I have!
4083 2018-07-23 16:10:58 This is to further his #TradeWar & DISTRACTION! His 2011/2013 tweets show he felt Obama would do this same move to DISTRACT! Now he is! Further, getting the Strait of Hormuz closed will drive up oil prices. He is working oil deal w/RUSSIA #TRADEWAR Dont Be Fooled!
4084 2018-07-23 16:10:45 Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) are driving man-made climate change. On result is hotter days and nights and longer unbroken periods of high temperatures. eg: "In nearby Kumagaya, 41.1C (105.98F) the highest ever on record in Japan"

4116 2018-07-23 16:08:15 I always managed to get it early in the spring, before everything had leaves and I'd clear out the dead winter brush and... oh, yeah. The oil is there, even in the stems and crap. And I was stupid.

4123 2018-07-23 16:07:39 Iran asked Britain to split oil proceeds with it 50/50. Britain's reaction to that charitable offer has led to decades of strife and countless dead.

4125 2018-07-23 16:07:36 I have a theory about Trump and Iran: Putin wants high oil prices to reverse the damage caused by Obama on Russia’s economy. Trump walked out of the Iran deal & oil prices went up. Trump tweets threats at Iran & oil prices spike. We r collateral damage in all this.

4151 2018-07-23 16:05:09 เกลียดโว๊คว่ะ มึงทำกับ ยุนอาแบบนี้ได้ยังไง โอ๊ยยยยยยยยยยยยยยย
4152 2018-07-23 16:05:06 Dear Lord, you think oil is immune to global markets? U must have slept thru 3 Seas, and NATO. Trump is taking energy power away from Russia
4153 2018-07-23 16:04:57 @LVPericles your dad with olive oil
4154 2018-07-23 16:04:53 スポドリの販売業者呼ばない？？？？？
4155 2018-07-23 16:04:51 เราไม่เคยใช้ bio oil นะ ก็เลยไม่รู้ว่าใช้แทนกันได้หรือเปล่า
4156 2018-07-23 16:04:51 I think President Trump is working on Alaska as well. It makes me mad as hell when I think of the string of globalist Presidents that have left us at the mercy of tyrants over oil - and it was our technology that helped those countries even get it out of the ground!
4157 2018-07-23 16:04:46 Since we are going to be drilling ,ore for oil, does this mean we will Finally build more refineries? 
Or just keep sending it out, so we have to buy it back 
At an exorbitant price?
We need more refineries,  we Need to be self sufficient
4158 2018-07-23 16:04:42 Oil.
4159 2018-07-23 16:04:40 No question but it's a tad different in places like Edmonton. With the NHL being the only game in town, much of sai issues are pointed in one direction...the Oilers.
4160 2018-07-23 16:04:38 Forget the price of Brent Crude Oil or interest rates. The price of Oros is what truly gives us an indication of where the economy is. Yeyi kubi. Kubi, bi
4161 2018-07-23 16:04:32 The TMX won't do anything to "uncouple from US dependence" it is just a shortcut to US west coast refineries.

There are no large waiting customers overseas, there is no magic "tidewater" price for our oil.
4162 2018-07-23 16:04:23 ノークソ診断ノーライフ！
4163 2018-07-23 16:04:16 Why not olive oil? You can spruce yourself up any time you go to an Italian/Greek/Med restaurant!
4164 2018-07-23 16:04:01 Yep it's textbook propoganda, people just repeat what they hear from politicians that have oil companies in their pockets.
4165 2018-07-23 16:04:00 Valvoline has completed its acquisition of the business assets of Great Canadian Oil Change Franchising, which is billed as the third-largest quick-lube system in Canada.  @Valvoline
4166 2018-07-23 16:03:54 やり直した。やっぱりこうかな。
4167 2018-07-23 16:03:47 I peeped that at this Midas i went to alll women changed my oil i was so happy to see that
4168 2018-07-23 16:03:45 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
4169 2018-07-23 16:03:42 Okay, thank you. I went through a full 30ml of Advanced Chocolate Mint & 15ml of Advanced Olive Oil and am still waiting for relief. The weird thing is when I first started out on 23mg I felt benefits but felt like it needed to be stronger. Now that is is stronger I get nothing?
4170 2018-07-23 16:03:35 When they announce they're for #MedicareForAll, leaving oil in the ground, support a woman's right to choose & to end systemic oppression & murdering of Blacks, then we'll talk.
4171 2018-07-23 16:03:35 I asked the guy at the oil change place how long it would take and his answer was “an hour? or maybe 30 minutes or less?? I dont know...” 

why do I always get the rookies?
4172 2018-07-23 16:03:29 First...please stop screaming. Oh @GOP ARE YOU SEEING THIS?! All Iran did was say that we can't tell them what to do with their oil, rightfully so imo. AND THIS is your response?!? Screaming?! Threatening?! 
You need to step down... #TreasonSummit
4173 2018-07-23 16:03:28 So the cocktail menu at the restaurant I was at  in LA offered a dropper of CBD oil in your drink as a $5 upgrade. That is something I had never seen before.

When in Rome...
4174 2018-07-23 16:03:25 Oil prices rose on Monday on worries over supply after tensions  worsened between Iran and the United States, while some offshore workers  began a 24-hour strike on three oil and gas platforms in the British  North Sea.

4177 2018-07-23 16:02:55 It is a horrible idea to take oil out of the strategic petroleum reserves. We are less than five years from a massive crisis.
4178 2018-07-23 16:02:48 there are a whole lot of galore types of things that one use. tea has flavours, all types of coffee, cooking oil plenty and rice is crossing borders.
4179 2018-07-23 16:02:33 Sir ji let the state & National leaders decide , why should I burn midnight oil on this issue ? I have better business to do. 

To get the harvest we have to work, when you work why worry about the yield ? 

If you do quality work, you will get quality yield.
4180 2018-07-23 16:02:26 I watched a doc on Otuabagi comm,Ogbia loc govt,Bayelsa where ur kinsman, @GEJonathan who superintended over this nation for almost 6yrs& I nearly cried with d untold neglect of a place where oil was first discovered. If u've an atom of shame,u should've looked urself in d mirror
4181 2018-07-23 16:02:22 What a lot of utter garbage you separatists post!!!!!! it isn't 'Oor Oil' and the Tories are not touching it. It belongs to private oil companies based in foreign countries. The Tories did however, reduce the tax burden on the companies when Swinney went begging
4182 2018-07-23 16:02:21 Funny enough Boateng was the only one who said the treatment of Özil was unfair. Everyone else stood by in silence or worse still poured oil into the fire and incase of Grindel stabbed Özil in the back. Why did they appoint a racist politician as their president?
4183 2018-07-23 16:02:20 I swear you can’t wear ripped jeans anywhere without someone making a comment.. sitting here getting my oil changed and this man goes do I need to buy you a pair of britches honey. No sir I bought them like this.
4184 2018-07-23 16:02:12 The fourth little pig built a studio instead of a house and preoccupied the wolf with a three hour long podcast about the benefits of of CBD oil and the misrepresentation of Jordan Peterson.
4185 2018-07-23 16:02:12 follow the money, it's always about money...and in this case in oil money, nuclear energy money.....it's always money

4188 2018-07-23 16:02:04 Bio Oil ใช้แทนกันได้มั้ยคะ ;=;
4189 2018-07-23 16:01:59 Excellent summary of the recent fish oil / omega 3 study claiming “no benefit”. Don’t react too quickly...Very interesting perspective thx for sharing.
4190 2018-07-23 16:01:56 1. Africa isn’t a nation. Different nations make up Africa 
2. Approx 294 US Embassies around the world and impoverished little old Haiti has the 4th largest. Why? 
3. Gold. Iridium. Oil. Petroleum. All in one place... way closer and with easier access.
4191 2018-07-23 16:01:54 To get ahead you gotta make sacrifices
4192 2018-07-23 16:01:22 There is also the China issue.  Remember, there is a strong financial alliance and relationship of these two.  Bombing or disrupting oil in Iran would be catastrophic for China and the globe.
4193 2018-07-23 16:01:11 i want a full body massage with alot of oil :(

4197 2018-07-23 16:00:57 To Iranian President Rouhani, hot wok, cold oil; foods don't stick.
4198 2018-07-23 16:00:55 Don’t mess with Texas. It’s a global oil superpower.

4203 2018-07-23 16:00:20 This is to further his trade war & cause DISTRACTION! His 2011 & 2013 tweets show he felt Obama would do this same move to DISTRACT! Now he is! Further, getting the waterway closed will drive up oil prices. He is working oil deal w/RUSSIA #TRADEWAR Dont Be Fooled!
4204 2018-07-23 16:00:18 wipe off excess oil when it starts to feel icky. also feel free to use another moisturiser if it works better for you, I just haven't found any others that don't break me out lol. my skin is combination and a huge diva

4208 2018-07-23 15:59:57 All tax revenue from oil obtained from Scottish waters are attributed in GERS no matter where the oil is landed - so simply put, you are wrong.
4209 2018-07-23 15:59:55 Well I only tried the CBD oil tablets & have to say they made no difference. I'm all for legalising for medical use. In fact, I think I'd allow it to be legal for everyone. It causes less trouble than alcohol! 
4210 2018-07-23 15:59:49 Using this logic most of the US oil & gas industry was colluding with Russia.

Steele was well-known to create false dossiers for money, and his Trump dossier has been debunked.
4211 2018-07-23 15:59:47 The third seal has been opened. Rev 6 Key words scales(trade war) and oil (threats of war) IMO

4213 2018-07-23 15:59:40 Knotting or spot prime them with bulls eye, two coats crown fastfow primer undercoat on the whole lot, then two coats of fastflow satin or gloss.  i like to avoid oil for interior jobs as much as possible.
4214 2018-07-23 15:59:40 It's not he being uneducated but his capability and capacity to lie I despise !!
GSPC can find fake oil, after lying no remorse
Cold-blooded !!

4216 2018-07-23 15:59:30 I take our CBD oil for my anxiety I love it  I'm hoping I can go off my zoloft soon. I also really want to get my god mother our CBD salve for her RA. I gave her some CBD for my dog (they live together) so I'm low key hoping she will try some for herself lol
4217 2018-07-23 15:59:25 We are olive trees of anointing oil bearing ever increasing fruit of fresh anointing, fresh oil.

4219 2018-07-23 15:59:14 Here's an idea.
Submerge the entire PC, barring spin disks and optical drives, in a few gallons of mineral oil.
Lubrication out the wazoo, AND a hell of a workout whenever you have to move the rig!
4220 2018-07-23 15:58:58 I have serious back issues and CBD oil has helped SO much. It helps my anxiety too. It doesn’t make me feel anything but myself. It helped my husband with a toothache last week. Just some drops under the tongue. BEST THING EVER!

4223 2018-07-23 15:58:41 We the people want a world without fossil fuel polluting internal combustion engines roaring, as they destroy our planet. We want quiet non polluting electric  vehicles  ASAP. Big Oil does not want this   Our leaders are playing into their hands with TMX
4224 2018-07-23 15:58:39 mine is long, but: one every few days, GENTLE cornmeal exfoliation, bentonite clay mixed with activated charcoal (leave on for a few mins), witch hazel, apple cider vinegar and sea salt diluted in water, then olive oil and vitamin e oil mixed together (while face is still wet)
4225 2018-07-23 15:58:37 Actually, I believe that he is hammering down on the Iranians to boost oil up and help out his buddy Putin with obtaining higher oil revenues.
4226 2018-07-23 15:58:36 18:58 Found a place on fire along JogooRd near Uhuru market & we were stuck in traffic with an oil tanker & the cops seemed unbothered. via @Muhoss MO #KenyanTraffic
4227 2018-07-23 15:58:33 The Iranian government make billions of $$$$$ from oil and starve their poor people and suppress their women and children. Why would you not want to take part in history to help these people by respecting your US President and backing America.

4229 2018-07-23 15:58:27 That moment when everyone in the doctors office is judging you for being glued to your phone like a ‘typical millennial’, when really you’re checking the price of oil and reading about investments. #workworkwork #psych
4230 2018-07-23 15:58:13 Burn the midnight oil
4231 2018-07-23 15:58:12 Joking aside, no one should be eating medicine or food synthesized from crude oil extracts. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen are made out of benzene today. The spirit of crude oil is not something you want in your body.
4232 2018-07-23 15:58:10 I just spilled a whole bottle of jojoba oil in my purse Jesus Christ
4233 2018-07-23 15:58:02 やったぜ！！！ぶっちゃけめちゃくちゃちゃんと局部描くの初めてに近いので喜んでもらえたのなら良かったでござる！！！
4234 2018-07-23 15:57:51 She doesn't have an essential oil to fix this??!!
4235 2018-07-23 15:57:34 trying to deal with a #wasp nest inside a pampas grass that needs chopping down because it's too big and too dry and too near our oil tank by employing the squirt wasp killer powder / agitate nest / run like fuck technique whilst shouting goawaygoawaygoawaygoawaygoaway . . . !
4236 2018-07-23 15:57:20 Oh, yes, the wise uncle, I love that. Rufus was very close to his uncle,(first bear in space) as his dad was away so much working on the oil rigs. Rufus and his uncle used to have long chats about science and the possibility of bearkind. Thankfully, his uncle won Noble Prize.
4237 2018-07-23 15:57:18 Love this hard-hitting “journalism”.

4240 2018-07-23 15:57:03 Alright Jason, I have had other conversations with you where you can't see beyond your own pride and beliefs. Blessings to you :)
4241 2018-07-23 15:57:02 Didn’t have a sew in for 6 months , now every sew in I get be itchy af!!! Need some more oil. 
4242 2018-07-23 15:56:54 First sunburn in years...am currently soaking in a bathtub with apple cider vinegar and coconut oil...any other remedies are welcome. 
4243 2018-07-23 15:56:53 Apply castor oil mixed with coconut oil mixed with olive oil and Neem oil and some curd and some dhaniya mirchi powder with a little bit of cucumber paste and tomato puree with Nivea cream . it'll help for sure 
4244 2018-07-23 15:56:53 Why I gotta flirt to get a great and cheap oil change 
4245 2018-07-23 15:56:44 Lmao my co worker told me she paid $10 to hit someone’s oil pen at a concert 
4246 2018-07-23 15:56:36 a new paradigm new model of efficiency yet? narrower lanes infinite overpasses, infrastructure to save cities oil? invest money in education and development of alternative energy a little with a little more gumption? incentivize the right things, be tough on the right industries?
4247 2018-07-23 15:56:34 SDF has recaptured Al-Sayjan oil fields from ISIS
4248 2018-07-23 15:56:25 Kau pakai before cuci muka. Biarkan 15 min lepas tu cuci. Lepas cuci apply oil cleanser, cuci dengan air suam, proceed dengan gel cleanser
4249 2018-07-23 15:56:22 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
4250 2018-07-23 15:56:22 I also said at least a decade ago (and ever since) that the next war would be fought over clean h2o, not oil. Now with fracking poisoning more and more ground h2o, good, clean h2o will become even scarcer making water wars ever more likely.

4255 2018-07-23 15:55:39 In aromatherapy, cedarwood oil is used to calm and balance the energies, promote spirituality, cure urinary tract infections, clear up dandruff and help to discharge phlegm. Today, we mainly use cedarwood oil for its aromatic properties, in a range of fragrance applications.
4256 2018-07-23 15:55:37 People create resources. Population growth correlates with increased resource extraction. How do you think we went from trees to coal to oil to nuclear? Creative geniuses are 1% of 1%; they need a critical mass of very bright people with leisure, who need a large mass of normies.
4257 2018-07-23 15:55:36 How is oil offered on altar? Entirely poured on pyre or just kometz poured.
4258 2018-07-23 15:55:32 Honda texted me to tell me I need an oil change. Like thank you i was trying to ignore that for a little longer 
4259 2018-07-23 15:55:26 Rashi- daily mincha of Kohen Gadol was first baked and then fried. There was significant ratio of oil to flour, hence left over oil was poured on altar.
4260 2018-07-23 15:55:23 Learned oil painting at Ayala Museum, was fun. I usually paint now digitally (Wacom tablet) or draw on paper (then scan). By the way any technique to make the oil paint dry faster? How long does your take to dry?
4261 2018-07-23 15:55:22 Not gonna bother with the oil change, it can wait.
4262 2018-07-23 15:55:12 how and where are y’all finding these men in the oil fields? i’m trying to see something. 
4263 2018-07-23 15:55:03 Hey Joe, we don't add any oil so it is just natural oil separation. This occurs because we don't use palm oil. The oil should blend back in with a good stir. Our peanut butter is 99.5% peanuts and 0.5% sea salt
4264 2018-07-23 15:55:02 If Trump also just happens to jack up world oil prices, that will help out his KGB handler, Vladimir Putin, quite a bit.
4265 2018-07-23 15:54:59 Any recommendations on concentrated oil pens?

4267 2018-07-23 15:54:51 Has i24 news become another propaganda outlet in support of the so-called Palestinians. Haven't they got enough outlets bought with Arab oil and other monies? Shame on i24 and its editors.
4268 2018-07-23 15:54:49 ZV91: What takes precedence? Frequency or holiness; If accidentally qorban that was supposed to be offered first, is offered second; Proper mechanism to offer oil on altar
4269 2018-07-23 15:54:46 Take off your shoes but leave on your socks the oil from your feet is not good for carpet and rugs
4270 2018-07-23 15:54:41 They don't have to influence you, they give you grade on your tests for how well you have been indoctrinated. Schools train children what they want them to understand.
4271 2018-07-23 15:54:37 I mainly got coconut oil for the beauty benefits though,,,,
4272 2018-07-23 15:54:24 Psychometrics isn't snake oil though it probably is coming from a kenyan
4273 2018-07-23 15:54:13 Red Virginia cedar (Juniperus virginiana), Texas cedar (Juniperus mexicana),  Chinese cedar (Chamaecyparis funebris) are the main sources of cedarwood oil used in perfumery today; contains chemical components responsible for enchanting scent of woody, ambery types of fragrances.

4278 2018-07-23 15:53:51 Sad and disgusting.  All for the greed for artery clogging palm oil.
4279 2018-07-23 15:53:46 He has zero clue: 1000s of ground troops would be in constant deployment just to "secure" the area; logistics to "take the oil" would be daunting; many would die....before/during/after; and exactly how do you secure nuked oilfields.
4280 2018-07-23 15:53:45 @BrianLehrer i’m not disabled, but i do wear dentures. straws are a must for drinking anything at home or out of the home. let’s talk about the real issue: the oil and gas companies who profit from plastic.
4281 2018-07-23 15:53:41 You look awesome. What you eat besides meats? Low carb vegetables? With a bit of olive oil?
4282 2018-07-23 15:53:39 Lmao...I’m not worried about a potential WWIII, i’m worried about the price of oil, cents per barrel...
4283 2018-07-23 15:53:36 Went to get my oil changed, waited in line for 40 minuets and  right as I’m about to leave my car the battery dies  goodbye $300 
4284 2018-07-23 15:53:34 Never thought I‘d ever be paying $3.63 a gallon for gas and $70 for oil changes. This world is going to hell!
4285 2018-07-23 15:53:25 ก็ถ้า fully hydrogenated oil ก็ไม่มีtransfat ได้นิ
4286 2018-07-23 15:53:24 Caring how the curriculum is written is an error of emphasis, why are we not just teaching the most important/empowering/transcending material...because of motives of politics. Education is chosen in alignment with what is tolerated politacally.
4287 2018-07-23 15:53:22 Mmhmm  it’s like a little pick-me-up. Eating little bit of coconut oil is good for you. Good source of healthy saturated fats. You should try it out for your blood sugar.
4288 2018-07-23 15:53:21 Life on Titan ? 
I thought it was funny when NASA said there were large amounts of oil and methane on Saturn's moon, Titan, but nobody realized that this was proof of extraterrestrial life because....how is oil and methane created? Todd Geer
4289 2018-07-23 15:53:18 the object is to get rid of industry, esp oil and gas.
4290 2018-07-23 15:53:13 Apple cider vinegar smells like castor oil le masepa and it's so good for so many things... I already feel nauseous
4291 2018-07-23 15:53:03 the west wanted him out for the same reason they are trying to get support for attacking Iraq.
Funny how countries who DONT WANT TO SELL THIER OIL IN DOLLARS are the terrorist ones
4292 2018-07-23 15:53:01 Drives up oil prices and makes Putin even richer.
4293 2018-07-23 15:52:57 I do see a lot of people on this app with greasy ass faces talkin about some “skin ” no that’s an oil stick baby, please invest in some blotting papers
4294 2018-07-23 15:52:52 Umm the US played a small role dive we conducted a coup in the mid 1950s to oust their democratically ejected presidents to ensure they didn't nationlize their own oil and cost the West cheap oil. We installed a dictator that kills many. Just giving the history
4295 2018-07-23 15:52:52 What's going on?  Nethanyahu, Bolton, Jared w/his Saudi contacts are going after Iran.  USA lecturing another country on rights and values...wow.  Iran will shut/slow down Strait of Hormuz (US troops preparing to die for oil again) the same time China/EU hit USA for tariffs.

4299 2018-07-23 15:52:33 Just watching CNN:
Trump is still bashing European allies.
He'll force Europe not buy Iranian Oil. If we don't stand at attention he'll impose tariffs on top of the tariffs already in place. 
PLEASE STOP THE MADNESS..!!

4305 2018-07-23 15:52:10 Where are you getting your oil changed?
4306 2018-07-23 15:52:10 M60T, derim en basiti. Şu an Aselsan'ın İsrail ile yürüttüğü bir sürü proje var. Resmi Gazete'de de "oil and seed" antlaşması kapsamında her yıl kota artıyor. Liderler tamamen halka oynuyor kısacası.

4308 2018-07-23 15:52:03 I think they said in the Faunus Remnant video, that if 2 different kind of Faunus were to have a child, then that Faunus could be anything.
4309 2018-07-23 15:51:58 Got to the dealership and nobody was in line for an oil change!!!! #LookAtGod
4310 2018-07-23 15:51:54 No I wasn't  I put oil on every part of my body EXCEPT my shoulders and my shoulders burned

4312 2018-07-23 15:51:52 Stricter regulation on the fuels used by the shipping industry make middle distillates in demand boosting crude oil demand 1.5 million barrels per day sending oil prices to $90 barrel in 2020... Oilsands only option to offset supply disruption.
4313 2018-07-23 15:51:44 LOVE Tweerman. And I always forget about this until my tools are way dull. Have you tried @TheBodyShop Almond Nail + Cuticle Oil pen? It is a WONDER for my cuticles and seems to keep hangnails at bay. There is also an Almond hand cream that is yummy.
4314 2018-07-23 15:51:33 How is that going to work for him? Gas/oil prices would skyrocket.
4315 2018-07-23 15:51:32 Cedar, also known as Cedrus, is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae, native to the mountains of Himalaya and the Mediterranean region. The oil obtained from cedarwood is one of the oldest ingredients used in perfumery.

4317 2018-07-23 15:51:21 Olive oil?
4318 2018-07-23 15:51:20 It’s a pipe dream being sold by snake oil salesmen that you shouldn’t trust to do anything they say.  Capitalism works just fine...as proven by the USA longstanding place at the top of the heap. Additionally, take a real look at dim run cities, they are a mess, dirty, high crime
4319 2018-07-23 15:51:04 i heard that those climber goats are involved in the production of argan oil...used on cosmetics...
4320 2018-07-23 15:51:02 hydrogenated oil เต็มคำเลยจ้า
4321 2018-07-23 15:51:01 Part of me is wondering why it's such an issue... The other part of me is like 
DONT GO VEGAN IF YOU HAVE A NUT ALLERGY AND CAN'T READ. 
Hahahaha 
And squeeze almonds hard enough and they do lactate. How you think almond oil made??
4322 2018-07-23 15:50:59 Yup stuck with all the profit kinder Morgan would have got. Stuck with safer transportation of oil. Stuck with a higher price for our oil because we can sell it to anyone instead of just the US for less then market price.
4323 2018-07-23 15:50:57 Sisther nkiruka you know biafran  crude oil morney is working!!!our  crude oil is like blood tonic to the westerners@@@
4324 2018-07-23 15:50:57 You choose to see what you want. I went through education system, had no issues. Never had any teacher try to influence me on one side of spectrum or not. You think everything is political. You can choose to believe that. I don't. Good bye. Take care.
4325 2018-07-23 15:50:49 Which part are you trying to fact check?

Nukes? No.

Yachts? Yes, people have yachts, including American oil tycoons like Evgeny Markovich Shvidler.

"Spy Ship" - There's just one, the Viktor Leonov, and it comes back ~yearly for 2 months.

There's no smoke, or fire.
4326 2018-07-23 15:50:45 I love those oil warmers, my house just be smelling good in every room you walk in and I only have 2 plugged in. One upstairs and one downstairs and you can still smell them in each room 
4327 2018-07-23 15:50:37 ดูของเก่าให้ทันก่อนนะ
4328 2018-07-23 15:50:34 Oh, Yah !  As an "old" kayaker now in my 70s often I've dreamt of a water taxi service to bring me home from the islands in Puget Sound nearest to Canada. Dodging oil tankers when wind and tides are against you is no fun.
4329 2018-07-23 15:50:21 Aku malah blm pernah pake VCO. Eh atau VCO ni sawit? Oooh iya ya kalo olive oil emang diirit2 wkwkw
4330 2018-07-23 15:50:19 Ancient Egyptians would use the oil from cedar trees in the embalming process, which in effect helped to keep the insects from disturbing the body.
4331 2018-07-23 15:50:15 The once-mighty Cedar of Lebanon forests of antiquity have been almost entirely eradicated, and today no commercial oil extraction is based on this species.

4334 2018-07-23 15:50:05 @vwcares flabbergasted that I am facing a $1300 repair on my 2013 VW Passat.  A vacuum pump oil leak?  Sounds like a defect instead of routine repair.  Unbelievable!  Anyone else get slapped with this nonsense?
#vwcares
4335 2018-07-23 15:50:04 This move will get Russia it's higher oil prices.
4336 2018-07-23 15:49:54 Me @ my art teacher: hi can I do pacrim fanart for this oil painting
4337 2018-07-23 15:49:42 Alright thanks. I'm a Malaysian of Indian heritage living in Kuala Lumpur. Oil's decision has sparked off a debate here, you have no idea. Right wing nationalist Islamist on one side and left wing progressives on the other. And the silent majority in the middle. I've had tell em
4338 2018-07-23 15:49:40 The cedarwood oil of the ancients, in particular the Sumerians and Egyptians, was derived from the Cedar of Lebanon, a true cedar native to the northern and western mountains of the Middle East.
4339 2018-07-23 15:49:33 Mate I’m stood over red hot oil vats all day:(
4340 2018-07-23 15:49:20 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
4341 2018-07-23 15:49:14 first mistake is assuming you know people based on a snippet of what you interpret they said. You are now off on a completely different point about deeper understanding. Do you know who or how curriculum was written? It isn't that deep. That was only point of this.
4342 2018-07-23 15:49:06 Anyone who doesn't understand the political affects and influence on education isn't looking very hard. Schools are largely places of political indoctrination....not an idea I have created. If you aren't aware of this Jason, you have the option to look into it as inspired.
4343 2018-07-23 15:48:57 I know, I'm repping my company account, but I'd like to share, if that's okay.  I use our CBD oil for my anxiety and honestly I'm hoping it will help me get off zoloft. I feel like it really helps me relax even when I feel like I want to cry over something stupid!
4344 2018-07-23 15:48:56 うえええん今日も出なかったね、、、
4345 2018-07-23 15:48:46 I use the anal plug training set. Small to large and i always use some sort of lube, raw coconut oil, lube, etc

4348 2018-07-23 15:48:36 You fried the orishirishi with oil and what? Is there tomatoes inside?
4349 2018-07-23 15:48:32 Ugh car repairs are robbing me  new tires, brake replacements, realignment, a/c service and oil changed bye 
4350 2018-07-23 15:48:27 Could she also be talking about a double wick oil lamp? That makes a lot more sense to me
4351 2018-07-23 15:48:23 Pipeline leaks are are a very small fraction of the volume that leaks NATURALLY.

If you think oil is that dangerous, quit using any oil or gas product.
4352 2018-07-23 15:48:17 Or he could be right and getting good advice. Presidents left Greenspan alone and we got a decade of deflation that blew up EM, Oil, others. Who says that the Fed  Chair cannot be criticized? Not the statute. Only the members of Chaos Inc. who benefit want silence. #JudeToldYouSo
4353 2018-07-23 15:48:11 Magnesium was one thing I didn't get enough of. Towards the 3~ week mark, I started taking a fish oil based multi-vitamin to calm my GFs nerves.
4354 2018-07-23 15:48:08 EH ASAN KA AT ASAN YUNG UNLI SOUP AND CHICKEN OIL HUHU
4355 2018-07-23 15:47:55 And? Is Iran part of the USA? Or do you again start an aggressive war like Iraq, Libya or Afghanistan? What you and #notmypresident want is OIL, OIL, OIL. #resist #makepeacenowar
4356 2018-07-23 15:47:47 Congratulations and GOOD for this woman,  and GOOD for Ontario for banning these door to door snake oil sales people!  
4357 2018-07-23 15:47:43 I wonder why USA is not going to FREE this country... oh wait, there is no oil there is there?
4358 2018-07-23 15:47:40 wanna go get sushi when i dont look like i dumped an oil vat on my head
4359 2018-07-23 15:47:38 Crude oil spike!!
4360 2018-07-23 15:47:32 I get that you don't think I understand Jason, you might use this as a convienient excuse not to dig deeper for yourself, you have chosen to believe what you 'prefer' maybe, where I strive for a deeper understanding, not prefer beliefs. That is how it seems to me. Could be wrong
4361 2018-07-23 15:47:28 I use tissue oil,glow ereng?????
4362 2018-07-23 15:47:26 A hour before I can be seen to get an oil change + the time it takes to get an oil change = time I don’t have. And this right here is why I don’t do adult shit!
4363 2018-07-23 15:47:17 Lets see what this Vitamin E oil is hitting for
4364 2018-07-23 15:46:56 If the Democrats were in charge, Iran would have us over a barrel.. Barrel of oil that is
4365 2018-07-23 15:46:55 2008-09 global financial crisis. Peak in global oil prices. 1991 economic crisis. Nuclear testings and wars also kept occuring at regular intervals.
Try diving into the economic history of India, you'll know what we've had to overcome to pick petty fights on toilets today.
4366 2018-07-23 15:46:50 Petrothugs of a feather raise oil prices together
4367 2018-07-23 15:46:44 And the Manefort trial, and he spiked oil prices for his buddies, and he did the same thing with a North Korea. Look how that turned out. Stop being manipulated by this POS and giving him control of the narrative FFS! This is a steal F’ing learning curve people. #TheResistance

4372 2018-07-23 15:46:20 In 2013 he said in a letter that he was an informal advisor to Russia. His focus was energy...he met with a president of a Russian oil company. He may have discussed sanctions and other policy in passing as anyone working in Russia would... ask the Podesta brothers

4374 2018-07-23 15:46:10 Russia needs the oil price to be $65.00 a barrel and with Iran out of the way we ALL subsidize Russia through $4.00 per gallon or more! Orange Puppet is dancing as the strings are pulled.

- Mandarins
4384 2018-07-23 15:44:52 The fact that there are Omega 3 Rx Drug Fish Oil equivalents; Vascepa, Lovaza, and Omacor should resolve any question as to benefit and efficacy for Cardiovascular disease like Elevated Triglycerides. This is #FakeNews to confuse the consumer.  O3 is always about quality + dose.
4385 2018-07-23 15:44:51 In 1953 The US overthrew a Democratically elected government in Iran and installed the Shah who ruled with an iron fist until the 1979 revolution. Everything was over the control of Iran’s oil. Today nothing has changed with the US trying to interfere in Iran using lies.
4386 2018-07-23 15:44:50 I should start carrying spare oil and banana peels to throw out my window when they aggravate me

4388 2018-07-23 15:44:44 Jason, education is largely directed by politics one way or another, otherwise school would be much more empowering, Meditation, acupucncture...not health, but health and healthy...huge difference, rather than teachings them body parts and encouraging them to rely on western meds
4389 2018-07-23 15:44:36 CAN the president with AN EO;
release all D oil & gas;
that we have IN abundance!
just to the American people:
2 lower D price of gas?
 especially before midterms?
we should be able to break even;
Since it’s 4 us !only !
it won’t go against D

4392 2018-07-23 15:44:24 Given the amount of stress I have America will invade me one day and they can have  2-3 litres of oil that my face secretes everyday.

4395 2018-07-23 15:44:09 I've been praying for a leader who wouldn't mince words and meant what he said.  With all than sand and oil, nuclear weapons would change Iran into a glass bowl filled with oil . . .
4396 2018-07-23 15:44:00 Why would you put tuna in brine when there's tuna in vegetable oil? And why would you not check which is which and buy the wrong one and open it for lunch and eat canned sadness

4399 2018-07-23 15:43:49 Wherever there’s a fire count on President Chump to pour oil on it.  Unless it’s started by Russia.
4400 2018-07-23 15:43:39 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4401 2018-07-23 15:43:38 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4402 2018-07-23 15:43:38 It demonstrated what really mattered to the US. Basically--Lithuania didn't have oil and we weren't willing to fight Russia over principles.
4403 2018-07-23 15:43:16 @ClubVelshiRuhle ALi Velshie: COME ON! "Prices of meat will come down"...? Except for (OFTEN GAIN-BASED MANIPULATED) prices of oil which fluctuate-WHAT OTHER COMMODITY do YOU KNOW, has come "down" in price in recent history? we'll believe it when I SEE it!!

4413 2018-07-23 15:42:30 They haven’t factored in the fact that we are taking oil out of the earth, earths natural coolant

4417 2018-07-23 15:42:22 With so much oil coming from America, nowadays. I'm a bit skeptical.
4418 2018-07-23 15:42:15 You saying I don't understand them. I'd say you are the one who doesn't understand when you make such a comment. You think people can't disagree for fear of retribution? Please stop with overreacting, inaccurate statements. They add nothing. Focus on original point.

4423 2018-07-23 15:41:45 there we go...Evil CEOE has now provided some foolproof Evidence of specific high temps in specific cities at specific times predicted by the 'oil industry' from 20 years ago!
4424 2018-07-23 15:41:43 I'm sorry.. can someone clarify what "a price that few countries have ever seen before" is? Blitzkrieg? Battle of Britain? D-Day?
Hiroshima? Tet Offensive? Desert Storm(you want that oil, don't you?)
Syria?

They talk like this without a care who would get hurt, killed..
4425 2018-07-23 15:41:40 Watched my first ever Rugby game while I was getting my oil changed Saturday.  I think Im hooked, now if I could just figure out the rules.
4426 2018-07-23 15:41:34 "That country with 70% of its economy in private hands, dependent on oil revenue that the recent US production boom tanked, an anti-left private media sector, & who are under perpetual US economic warfare & CIA backed counter-revolution measures, is failing because communism."
4427 2018-07-23 15:41:29 That is what the railroads thought with Rockefeller and oil.  Then he replaced them.
4428 2018-07-23 15:41:26 Upgrading the military by almost $1 billion, tough sanctions and expulsion of diplomats, strengthening NATO by puting money in, reprimanding Germany for dependency on Russian oil. Meeting them head on in Syria. All this does not serve Putin! It serves the United States!!
4429 2018-07-23 15:41:20 He did that to stop west stealing the oil.
why are you making exuses for an aggresive act?
they were his oil wells not ours
4430 2018-07-23 15:41:20 WHEN WILL REPUBLICANS SEE ENOUGH & ACT? Trump now wants a war to deflect attention away from his Conspiracy Investigation. Trump’s unilateral war will cost AMERICANS our sons, daughters & Billions. Only Israel & maybe Saudi Arabia will help Trump. The only winner: Russian oil
4431 2018-07-23 15:41:08 Clinton's and California have been locking up production of Russian oil fields for a long time. There intent to continue was hedged by Russia and now our administration. The democratic international mowing machine has run out of gas. International business is now fair game.
4432 2018-07-23 15:41:08 悲しいね
4433 2018-07-23 15:41:07 How am I supposed to value myself as a person when literally every job I apply to doesn’t respond or wants to pay me less than I need to live???
That was a trick question, I don’t have any value as a person, I am a cog in a machine. Oil me up.
4434 2018-07-23 15:41:04 I would hope Americans remember what we (our CIA) did to Iran’s Democratically elected leader in ‘53, along with us propping up a violent dictator. For what? Iran’s oil. If he forces a civil war, make no mistake there is a reason. It’s their oil he wants. History always repeats
4435 2018-07-23 15:41:01 It’s good to work in an oil company 
4436 2018-07-23 15:40:45 Also, through his rhetoric attempting to manipulate oil prices higher to benefit???  Russia!!!

4444 2018-07-23 15:39:35 Imagine how much different this country would potentially be now if Al Gore had been President on 9/11 instead of two pants sh**ing fear mongers looking for an oil deal?  It would not have saved this man's life but we'd have a lot fewer combat casualties.

4454 2018-07-23 15:38:31 Castor oil is amazing. When I get super stressed, I start itching and my joints ache at the fingers and the elbows...did the trick. Feel better
4455 2018-07-23 15:38:23 The White house misused intelligence in 2003. President Cheney & Co wanted a war - for oil and money, so they cherry picked intelligence to fit their agenda. We are still paying for the GOP voters mistakes and gullibility from that time - and now they gave us Trump. Shame!
4456 2018-07-23 15:38:21 Yes. I agree. It is a global issue. Additionally it is made with oil which causes sociopolitical conflicts. According to the plastics manufacturing industry, it takes around 3.4 megajoules of energy to make a typical one-liter plastic bottle, cap, and packaging.

4461 2018-07-23 15:37:56 I saw a game in Calgary & Rogers place this past April & one thing became clear, the love for the Oil Drop is everywhere. The passion is real & its awesome & I'm proud to be part of that. However, SOME fans need to stop being morons. Heckle the guys on the ice but not in public!
4462 2018-07-23 15:37:51 Me too. When I lived in Houston I was pretty confident we’d get a direct hit in case of nuclear war. (Huge port, huge source of oil, gas & petrochemicals). Now out here in Central Texas I’m less sure. Ugh. What a thing to worry about.

4465 2018-07-23 15:37:17 Quit allowing export of oil, gasoline, and natural gas. As before. Stop speculation on the commodies market, only ones that need to trade are those that use the product.

4498 2018-07-23 15:34:39 perhaps. but calgary’s flooding, and towns full of oil workers plopped in the middle of nowhere, suggest hasty urban planning. and now we’re all paying for it with our insurance.

4512 2018-07-23 15:33:03 Of course that would jack oil to at least 200/barrel if not over 400 & completely annihilate the economy as most of OPEC's oil would go offline and a fuel famine would occur. Everything stops in that scenario, people don't go to work, store shelves empty, medicines become scarce
4513 2018-07-23 15:33:02 Pres. Carter backed rebellion against the Shah, because the Shah was planning on backing off from Westernization / selling its oil to the US. The US didn’t like that and backed Khomeini’s return from Paris where he was exiled to...and voila. He got played! And so are you.
4514 2018-07-23 15:32:59 North Korea! Next Iran! Same pattern! You talk strength! Now oil independent! Yes Texas Oil! Good bye to opex! News will also report same.   Trump crazy! Trumps too strong! Trump wants war! Then Revese say he is too nice! End game Trump wins

4526 2018-07-23 15:31:19 Why do I suspect that first item, push oil to $200/barrel, might have been an agenda item in the Trumputin one-in-one?
4527 2018-07-23 15:31:00 I think it's about the oil.  Put sanctions back on Iran's exports, and lift sanctions on Russia so that Russia gets the customers. "A Trump administration official promised to get the number of countries "importing Iranian crude [oil] down to zero," sparking a backlash in Iran."
4528 2018-07-23 15:30:57 Naw Bushes family is in oil. Going to war in the Middle East had more to do with oil than it did for 9/11.

Trump wanted to end the war so the neocons tried to frame him as being pro-Putin. Which side are you on Olin, the side of peace or the side of murder for oil?
4548 2018-07-23 15:30:08 Lmao people take the caesar serious even more than oil hahaha

4553 2018-07-23 15:29:56 Every other week there’s a new fad cure all. A few months ago, it was cannabis oil for pain and skin issues. My mother has no pain or skin issues and is super religious and against everything marijuana related, but she wanted to try this.

4556 2018-07-23 15:29:32 . People actually drink coconut oil. But not in large quantities. You could put in your coffee or tea. And you can also use it to cook
4557 2018-07-23 15:29:25 So he has created a litmus test around a vague concept/platitude, in which after decades in congress he doesn’t even have a real bill to go with it. This is snake oil hucksterism.

4560 2018-07-23 15:29:13 @realDonaldTrump all caps tweet today was thought of another crazy tweet. What's new? All sorts of theories of what's behind them. Not one I have seen thought it was a coordinated theater in which to boost oil prices. Which...enriches...wait for it. Russia.
4561 2018-07-23 15:29:08 The civil war wasn't about slaves, it was about the North wanting the resources of the South and the taxes.  Slaves was the motovation - just like the WTC Center was the motovation for 9/11 even tho that was all about money oil and drugs.

4576 2018-07-23 15:27:59 last week my skin was on the StRuGgLe BuS after switching up a few products so I amazoned some black seed oil after someone was raving about it & I’m happy to report that in 5 days my face has done a 180. it’s glowing, more even, and scars are fading. 

black seed oil. get some.
4577 2018-07-23 15:27:54 Just realized how bad my diet is actually. Grains, Sugar and Oil 
Sad truth: I will continue eating it until I die
4578 2018-07-23 15:27:48 correlary what you customers do with the product after buying is immaterial. T shirts could be worn, framed and hung on wall as art, or used to soak up used oil. The pay is the same.
4579 2018-07-23 15:27:47 Ok I have 4 big fridges and no power for 4-5 days.  Obviously fresh and frozen foods  are trash. But what about parmesan cheese?  Ketchup?  Vinegar based pickles & marinated peppers etc.  Salad dressings?  Toasted sesame oil?  I've got to log it all for insurance.
4580 2018-07-23 15:27:41 Its what Putin wants! This is part of the secret talks between them in Helsinki. It's OIL, OIL, OIL!!!
4581 2018-07-23 15:27:34 Over through one of these Government tariff sprees not only did it result in significant higher prices for goods to the Consumers, it resulted in gas/oil imports to go through the roof. Gas prices for vehicles & home heating were nearby unaffordable
4582 2018-07-23 15:27:34 Better off for who? The rich are richer while the middle class is finding more jobs that pay minimum wage with no benifits. Now were paying back our minimal tax cuts to oil companies as artificialy inflated gas prices. How the economy is doing depends on where you measure it.
4583 2018-07-23 15:27:22 Guy at my job burned his hand changing the fry oil. Whole time the protective gloves he's suppose to be wearing are right next to him

4595 2018-07-23 15:26:32 FWIW--I've actually used lemon eucalyptus oil (Repel brand), and been pleased with its effectiveness. Not quite as effective or long-lasting as DEET, and much smellier, but it works. And doesn't eat my gear. But, for someplace like state #49, I'd still use DEET. Lots of it.
4596 2018-07-23 15:26:21 Wait.. So they can survive being dipped in oil, fried at a high temp., ect.  How we don't know you left that out for a couple of hours after purchase & did this for clout? & the WHOLE bag of w/e it came out of should be infested TOO

Oil in the ground value 3$ /£2.30 if they hit off course.

Equates to a share price of £2 a share.

And people are selling at 8p. !!!! Pure madness
4604 2018-07-23 15:24:33 Oil "rose" on US-Iran tensions caused by a Trump Tweet in response to... oh, never mind. Oil is going back down now. Price reaction followed by price relaxation. Becoming the rule and not the exception, anymore. #TrumpTweet #CrudeOil
4605 2018-07-23 15:24:33 My guess is an attack by Republican Guard patrol boat in Strait of Hormuz. Trigger for naval asssult and blockade and then gets more for his oil? Pootie.

4609 2018-07-23 15:24:02 My oil on -580 
4610 2018-07-23 15:23:57 We took Iraq`s oil,I remenber the americans guarding oil fields while people emptied the museums.
And this cos people who were not Iraq`is attacked the USA?
we are all being led by liars and a compliant media

4614 2018-07-23 15:23:39 Geez....maybe bankers...republican lobbyists..oil executives...mining conglomerates..evangelical religious groups...?
4615 2018-07-23 15:23:39 I thought going to the oil change place at 11:00 on a Monday was a great idea, but in fact it was a terrible idea. My car is sitting behind someone’s that wants all of their tires changed and rotated. #Mondays
4616 2018-07-23 15:23:34 usually the squeaky wheel gets the  oil but i think it should be replaced NOW!!! #MoggOut

4624 2018-07-23 15:22:45 Trump said he would have all countries stop buying Iranian oil. All those countries are tweeting “Lol”
4625 2018-07-23 15:22:44 As world transitions from low-sulfur diesel, a cleaner-burning fuel, to lower emissions. “stricter regulation on fuels used by shipping industry will result in booming demand for middle distillates that boost crude oil demand by additional 1.5 million barrels per day in 2020

4638 2018-07-23 15:21:41 So oil leak is nothing major cause the dipstick level hasn’t budged since I bought it but coolant is still being pissed away somewhere... found two drops on the floor and it’s definitely the drivers side somewhere
4639 2018-07-23 15:21:37 Possibly, although there's plenty of oil in Syria and the West's lack of intervention has cost thousands of lives and millions of homes.
4640 2018-07-23 15:21:35 But the peanut butter turned out to be the gross organic kind with the layer of oil on top
4641 2018-07-23 15:21:27 Oil goes up, people get more fuel efficient cars, drive less, and have no choice but to consume less because things will cost more.  If you are climate change believing liberal isn't this the very thing you WANT people to do?
4642 2018-07-23 15:21:14 Wow...lari2...sistur safety...keje oil and gas ke?
4643 2018-07-23 15:21:10 those recipes tho
4644 2018-07-23 15:21:07 Or maybe Trump promised to Putin to increase oil price.

4653 2018-07-23 15:20:27 Yes, it's basically when his/her own situation is secure & he/she sees ppl around him/her making money. If you're drilling oil in ND difference between 3% & 5% $$ isn't going to matter compared to what you think the price of oil will be & whether you see others making money

4661 2018-07-23 15:19:53 You really just need a dab of it- you do too much and might break out but... I mean... Even I was hesitant when I tried it. I was amazed. 
You can add in a couple drops of tea tree or lavender oil for other added benefits.

4667 2018-07-23 15:19:17 You can talk up oil and gas plays as much as you like but unless you have someone at hand that is a qualified expert in Structural Geology and the Geomechanics of Reservoirs you really are just a speculator...#fact
4668 2018-07-23 15:19:12 Didn’t have any grease on hand, so I used aromatherapy oil to loosen my umbrella.

I haven't really used it on my face but it's reduced my scars, prevented me from peeling after a sunburn, helped clear my scalp after it got burned (put it on before and washed it out), helped my friend with a tooth ache...

4677 2018-07-23 15:18:15 After looking weak with Kim & Putin. This idiot is willing to drag us into a war to satisfy his ego.  (Him big strong Alfa man.)He has been yelling at the Saudi’s & Iranians to produce more oil to bring oil prices down. So he does the 1 thing that will drive prices thru the roof.
4678 2018-07-23 15:18:10 Yeah, and my dad was a jet mechanic but I can barely change the oil in a car. Taking half the cash from someone and letting the government spend it it stupid. Especially the US government.

4681 2018-07-23 15:18:00 Putin did a really good job preventing the Russian tech sector from challenging the petrochemical industry that was making all his friends rich. That was a great idea until suddenly oil was $45 a barrel.

4696 2018-07-23 15:16:22 How exactly has/will Iran or NK hurt you?
Neither has deposed a government except Iran in Lebanon after Reagan cut and ran 36 years ago.
The issues are oil/gas for Europe and nukes for Saudi Arabia.
One is good, the other is very very bad.
 Can you determine which one?

4705 2018-07-23 15:15:46 I absolutely agree. When BP bought out @POLARnetwork I was..am concerned. And yes, the oil companies have a terrible record on environmental issues and irresponsible lobbying. One has to hope that they have the right intentions. Time will tell.
4706 2018-07-23 15:15:34 Yes they will. Then we will find out exactly how badly the EU wants Iranian oil. Will they stand with their ally? We all know we will.

4721 2018-07-23 15:14:36 not really, he wanted war with NK , then Putin talked him out of it since NK is a big buyer of Russian products, like oil. This is a fall back till Putin calls him tonite.

4723 2018-07-23 15:14:27 Oil is at about $70 a barrel.  Liberal economists are now predicting $400 to scare voters, despite the USA pumping record amounts domestically.

It's global warming 2.0.

There is less oil than there was 150 years ago, it circles in the atmosphere like an avenging god looking to kill us all. Less phosphorus, less potash, less fresh water, less topsoil, less diversity.

4790 2018-07-23 15:08:29 I'm Sicilian, African-American, and Indian and it's a cultural thing for me too but I don't see no difference except the oil being used. The oil probably has a lot more flavor since it was used & all the flavors from whatever you cooked in it has released into the oil.

4792 2018-07-23 15:08:17 I agree, of course - but most hard left parties have also traditionally been careless of the planet, and only interested in who has their hand on the expansionist tiller eg fully nationalised oil,  gas and other similar enterprises..
4793 2018-07-23 15:08:07 they are perfect for cement production as they burn with lot of mineralic ash apt as substitution material. otherwise one would use more heavy oil. However I wonder if there were no demand for cheap and intact rotor blades in poor countries

4827 2018-07-23 15:05:35 Iran does not have nuclear weapons but has lot of oil which these people want to control.

4829 2018-07-23 15:05:34 They promised to deregulate the oil industry as well when they would come in power until they found out what a cash cow it is. The rest is history.

4831 2018-07-23 15:05:22 Someday I’ll walk through the shop without stepping in a puddle of oil. Today is not that day.
4832 2018-07-23 15:05:21 Running low on this oil cartridge how will I get through work this week lol

4835 2018-07-23 15:05:12 The United States CIA and Britain M16 ousting Iranian democratic leaders and installing puppet govt is how you got the current regime so looks like y'all gon go for round three of trying to control their oil
4836 2018-07-23 15:05:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4837 2018-07-23 15:05:03 I'm North African and dipping bread in olive oil is a cultural thing but idk about the roasted chicken oil DGJKHFGD like it's been cooked and stuff but it's SO GOOD.

4839 2018-07-23 15:04:54 I just want my oil changed and they wanna play.
4840 2018-07-23 15:04:51 I need some tea tree oil
4841 2018-07-23 15:04:50 So you are 100% spot on correct that the Kremlin would be the almighty world power. 

Also who owns that 19.5% of Rosneft? That could be worth trillions in a Russian oil dominated world.
4842 2018-07-23 15:04:44 They really dont want tranparency in the sector, that why they have been footdragging
4843 2018-07-23 15:04:40 I think the corn oil and olive oil are more healthy
4844 2018-07-23 15:04:38 They did exactly what they were told to. They shifted some spending from investment to consumption. The economy recovered, led by exports, such as olive oil.
4845 2018-07-23 15:04:35 Hahaha!! Its a buildup of oil on the scalp then and since your scalp isn't used to it, it changes pH and bacterial count. Not necessarily bad just uncomfortable. That's what my stylist said to me anyways. I go 4 days now to preserve color but the switch was tender!
4846 2018-07-23 15:04:31 My dad is always complaining about that and also they been dumping oil into the water
4847 2018-07-23 15:04:21 udah. kalo ga salah ingat kantung mata pakai kantung teh. trus alis pake produk oil oilan. hasilnya keliatan jangka panjang, ga instan btw
4848 2018-07-23 15:04:16 Gotta respect @BrianJScheid and @meghangordon for using Eminem's "Rock Bottom" off the legendary Slim Shady LP as the soundtrack to their new podcast episode on Venezuela's lost oil production
4849 2018-07-23 15:04:03 An executive at an oil company (not my company). It would have ruined a $30,000 shredder if he hadn’t noticed.

4851 2018-07-23 15:03:53 we need more electric cars on the road if our Govt were making the investments in electric cars that is needed we wouldn't be dependent on oil or the mid east, iran closing the strait wouldn't even be an issue @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @moveon @TheYoungTurks @timryan @nytimes @WSJ
4852 2018-07-23 15:03:48 2 new tires and an oil change at the same time. #BadLuckMirna
4853 2018-07-23 15:03:33 A vivid map of a rudderless ship. The USA has no reason to be defending Saudi Arabia and Gulf oil anymore.
4854 2018-07-23 15:03:21 Actually I only know how to add oil on fire.. hahaha
4855 2018-07-23 15:03:21 @posthillinnkeep to learn about the sugar and seed oil industries read books  @garytaubes @bigfatsurprise  and @zoeharcombe
4856 2018-07-23 15:03:17 Na, that's not gross and pretty normal. People usually dip their bread in olive oil mixed with herbs. I don't see the difference the roasted chicken oil probably taste good.

4858 2018-07-23 15:03:07 India is likely to cut oil imports from Iran by November when the sanctions come into effect, but it's not official yet.
4859 2018-07-23 15:03:06 Trump uses breaking OPEC as a tool to switch to more Russian based oil consumption. 

Iran war happens - OPEC is hobbled. 

At first Russia sets $55 a barrel and when Iran/OPEC happens, Putin pushed Russian oil up to $125 a barrel or so, bankrupting companies along the way.
4860 2018-07-23 15:03:04 #DownerDisney Moana: Moana sails beyond the reef to study, understand and fight anthropocentric global warming at a university. She realizes this is a losing fight and becomes a lobbyist for an oil company after graduating.

Her family is driven off Motonui by rising sea levels.
4861 2018-07-23 15:03:00 Pegel bangeeet apalagi pas cleansing oil, 4 menit mijet mijet muka sendiri
4862 2018-07-23 15:02:54 I brought a book with me to the dealership while my car is getting an oil change. But now the Price is Right is on... guess I’m not reading today

Я хочу парную тату с бтс
4864 2018-07-23 15:02:51 Ya tgah pakai bio oil la ni ... hahaha .. tempek jela kat muke kan ?
4865 2018-07-23 15:02:51 Now POTUS wants to drain SPR for votes. US hydrocarbon 'isolationism' is a very stupid concept based entirely on the false premise of shale oil abundance and an unlimited   source of low interest QE based capital.  America's current energy policy is a disaster for the long term.
4866 2018-07-23 15:02:50 Oh wow! The bench kicking the trash can, the cargo in the back of the truck and the oil tanks in the yard...so many details, man! And the animation was so we'll done.
4867 2018-07-23 15:02:50 How come the center is just republican policy from 20 years ago? ACA is just Romney’s old health plan. Centrism left Guantanamo and ICE in operation. Let oil companies steal and polute native land & water. Centrism isn’t opposed to endless wars or stopping white terrorists.
4868 2018-07-23 15:02:43 Man Citys Owners own oil companies in a country that oil derives from. Running an oil company and selling oil. Generating their own revenue. They still have spendature to pay out in order to make any profits. They dont just get handed lumps of money from the state.
4869 2018-07-23 15:02:43 I’m a strong believer in not putting off until later what can be done now - so when I called to schedule my oil change and they said there was an appt in 30 minutes, I said I’d be right there! #productivity
4870 2018-07-23 15:02:37 Actually, it's Mr. Minister of Petroleum
4871 2018-07-23 15:02:32 Bitch awo si ta ami ta esun cu a horta keshi y olive oil? 
4872 2018-07-23 15:02:31 음 ^^ 제 미래가 사탄인가요 성모 마리아인가요
4873 2018-07-23 15:02:24 Politicians regularly disparage those who work for banks, oil companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, plaintiff attorneys, technology companies, etc. Why should Amszon be off limits?
4874 2018-07-23 15:02:10 40 years after the revolution, oil money and still this way? No doubt, this regime must fall now!!
4875 2018-07-23 15:02:08 There are some logical and economic fallacies here. Did riding pensions and public wages stimulate the olive oil industry that significantly? Doubtful. It says there wasn’t even that significant a public stimulus, right?
4876 2018-07-23 15:02:00 Putting coconut oil on in this weather means you're essentially just cooking yourself, aren't you?
4877 2018-07-23 15:01:53 Hope you’re right. The paranoid person in me says THIS is what Helsinki was about. Trump declares war on Iran. They WILL block the strait of Hormuz. Oil from the Middle East can’t move. Who benefits? Putin who can now supply China, Korea and Japan.
4878 2018-07-23 15:01:43 So, let me ask you this then? What drives risk appetite? I am sitting here in North Dakota and am deciding to drill some oil. If cheap money doesn't matter my decision, what does? How would guy in real economy make a decision? He isn't savvy to use some risk appetite guage right?
4879 2018-07-23 15:01:36 I know this is gross af but I love dipping bread in roasted chicken oil.
4880 2018-07-23 15:01:35 Sorry Rob but pick a war the story and plot are always the same = Blood for Oil - so pick a war in 60 years that hasn't got Oil/Gas involved don't single one out please - all are the same !
4881 2018-07-23 15:01:33 와 개쩌네요
4882 2018-07-23 15:01:23 Teddy Roosevelt took on the "bad" monopolies of his day: railroads and oil, for the good of America. Please revisit antitrust law such as the Sherman and Clayton Acts. America succeeds through competition, not monopoly.
4883 2018-07-23 15:01:20 I’m getting my oil changed and there’s a literal flat earther trying to loudly convince the desk worker of his theories
4884 2018-07-23 15:01:18 424 kan pake cleansing oil nder. kleveru itu face oil
4885 2018-07-23 15:00:56 It's a Spanish restaurant, I think the olive oil content in the air alone is enough to keep it oiled up :P
4886 2018-07-23 15:00:56 @tgruener @andihaupt1

Do you plan to elaborate more on this ?

#AMuS 

Photographers reported that  Sirotkin had already slid through the gravel bed in the Sachskurve. The Merc V6 of the Russian lost to a leak engine oil. Maybe SV slipped on exactly this one.
4887 2018-07-23 15:00:52 ...Iran has the "other" great oil reserve outside of the terrorist state of Saudi Arabia.

4891 2018-07-23 15:00:43 I'm fairy certain that this was discussed in the Bolton/Putin/Trump meetings. I read somewhere on a reliably sourced news site that Russia NEEDS oil to be at least $100 a barrel. 

Trump's rhetoric about "breaking up OPEC" is the old bait and switch.
4892 2018-07-23 15:00:39 It's one of the biggest sources for cooking oil and it's getting more and more popular. I use it all the time

4898 2018-07-23 15:00:18 A reminder. We had so such agreement. Instead of "de-escalated", The Mullah regime in Iran sent more troops to Syria to Kills syrians, more troops and weapons to Yemen, more money to Islamic Jihad and Hamas while the Iranian people got no benefit. The "allies" only want IRI oil

4903 2018-07-23 14:59:45 Of course, mass murderer Saddam was installed by the West.  His genocidal activities only became "interesting" to us when he started acting against the financial interests of his Western collaborators vis-à-vis oil.

Genocide became the main excuse for invasion after WMD failed.

4932 2018-07-23 14:56:35 Last I heard was trying to get Dr's trained to prescribe it, then licencing Big Pharma to grow it or outsource, make the oil, sell it. Safety, quality etc to be set up while people suffer.
Small qty can be imported. Then Govt wants Oz to be "the best & biggest" world supplier.

4945 2018-07-23 14:55:26 Don't you see.. The Iran "thing" is also for Russia! If what is happening makes the oil and gas prices rise, this will be the best thing for the Russian economy and will please Vlad--BIGLY!

4961 2018-07-23 14:53:58 @Joa129x that is so not good for your car.  I understand being tired I have a 4 year old and a 8 month old.  But please change your oil you don't want your motor to get blown. $50 oil change is better than $4000 plus for a motor..

4980 2018-07-23 14:52:13 Threat of war does what to oil prices? Drives them up. Who's that help? Putin. Iran. Surely no connection to a Trump who loves him a Putin.
4981 2018-07-23 14:52:12 Trump needs oil prices to go up.  Oligarchs invested in oil with illegal loans and need higher returns since these loans are due soon.  Unrest in Middle East creates higher prices.  Also, RU has oil to sell us!  Dig deeper @politico
4982 2018-07-23 14:52:10 Ooh great, nurse suggested bio oil bit it didn't really work on my last set of stitches so will investigate! Thanks
4983 2018-07-23 14:52:09 It’s Bolton/Cheney.  They want the Golan Heights for oil.  Check out Genie Oil& Gas.

4987 2018-07-23 14:51:59 Brace yourself for an upcoming avalanche of "experts" warning of "$400 oil" and the "looming recession."

The only way to combat a great economy is to pretend it's all about to collapse. Expect to see A LOT of this BS on the networks between now and Nov 6th.

4994 2018-07-23 14:51:21 Why Rohani threatened America? Because it will reduce the value of the Iranian currency, Iran sells oil in dollars and pays employees' salaries in rial
Why trump has threats to Iran? Because the depreciation of the rial causes the suffering of the Iranian people

And all that oil thing is just FUD
5016 2018-07-23 14:49:45 You're missing the greater picture.  Iran has nothing left at this point.  The Rial is collapsing.  Their only source of income, oil - has been cut off by the rest of the world.  This was planned. Watch and see: the Iranian people are going to force the Mullahs to go.
5017 2018-07-23 14:49:42 Are you referring to the rates being raised by the Fed, the shock of the oil prices, the shock of the metal prices and hence the higher country risk premia for weakened economies, ? We have the currency depreciation given the impact of the trade tariffs.
5018 2018-07-23 14:49:37 No. We will if Iran blocks the flow of oil. Good job TRump.

5045 2018-07-23 14:46:52 @TiggerTherese it does push up the price of oil though? So maybe Putin asked him to?
5046 2018-07-23 14:46:49 An artificial creation because we demand their oil.  Same failed strategy as South Sudan.

5048 2018-07-23 14:46:39 You’re right that renewable energy is replacing oil/coal/gas on a micro scale — but on a global scale, we’re not replacing fossil fuels with renewables, we’re merely “topping them up”. From a macro perspective that’s what the quote is saying.
5049 2018-07-23 14:46:37 Looks like another quarter of 20% earnings growth. Consensus estimates are calling for a 21% YOY increase in $SPY index. Tax cuts, strong manufacturing activity, a weaker U.S. dollar and higher oil prices all point to strong results.

Trump wants to be personal partners with Putin. The big money is in oil.  Not Hotels
5053 2018-07-23 14:46:10 ExxonMobil says it could be producing 750,000 b/d of oil in Guyana by 2025, upping its estimate for reserves in the Stabroek block to 4bn barrels.

5058 2018-07-23 14:45:48 President @realDonaldTrump owns oil investments, right? He MUST own oil investments.

5087 2018-07-23 14:42:57 That's the ticket start a war w/Iran, which in turn will increase the cost of oil. The increase in the cost of oil will increase the cost of goods. The increase cost of goods & your tariff war will create another recession. You will be famous for treason & destroying the economy.

5097 2018-07-23 14:41:40 my best one of these was getting my card declined trying to buy a marie claire I was in. Also being sent bath oil by Chanel and being like, babes, I cannot afford a flat with a bath.
5098 2018-07-23 14:41:34 Interesting the different levels of tech in cars. Our Toyota Sienna can tell us when a tire is low no info on which tire or by how much. Our 2015 Silverado just sent me an email that the right front tire is low by 3 lbs, how many miles left on this tank of gas, and oil life left.
5099 2018-07-23 14:41:33 Now US will decide from where India will buy Oil or DefenceEquipments as SovereignNations now needs approval from UncleSam to decide policy matters,is this a new @UN mandate which members obliged to follow,sply for India in line of fire on religious freedom or HR reports

5100 2018-07-23 14:41:27 The big question is what can you do about it. Growing the economy WITHOUT harming the people should be the priority. It seems that your environmental policy has backfired because it hurts the majority of Canadians and helps the multinational oil cartels.
5101 2018-07-23 14:41:12 @cdncyclist I posted a classified ad to sell a relatively expensive bike and got a hit, but it was one of those "I'm on an offshore oil rig... i want to pay by paypal... I have someone to pick it up..." scams.  Perhaps post alerts to your users to be aware of scams like this.
5102 2018-07-23 14:41:10 white people should be banned from taking a public speaking class.. they told me i should use coconut oil on my skin, how to not get bit by a shark, how to fish, and that i should be in everyones business... disgusting
5103 2018-07-23 14:41:03 I always felt that one of the primary reasons we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq (apart from oil, and exerting a larger, more robust military footprint in the region) was an attempt to hem in and better contain Iran.
5104 2018-07-23 14:40:59 Oil? In Crimea?
5105 2018-07-23 14:40:48 ‘Hard left’ = people who want to stop bombing countries and murdering people for oil, and who want a system that prioritises the needs of the many, not the elite. If you don’t want these things, then you are not a leftist and should perhaps join the Lib Dems?
5106 2018-07-23 14:40:46 Russia let its extenral break even rise above $100 a barrel back in 12-13, so it wasn't saving much.  definitely not Norway

and think a lot of the Russian oil surplus funded private outflows and this just looks at public wealth ...

5112 2018-07-23 14:40:13 Putin won’t stop until he gets the sanctions lifted, so he can use Exxon to extract a trillion $ of oil. That’s a big incentive. And Tillerson will be right there when it happens.

5162 2018-07-23 14:34:28 Two questions for you Darryl
1) Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

5171 2018-07-23 14:33:39 Why War US v. Iran is very likely to happen:
1) Iran is not nuclear state and drumpf is a bully who will threaten& attack ppl perceived weaker.
2) Drumpf's main foreign backers Israel (Netanyahu) & corrupt arab petro states want it.
3) Pooty will profit from rising oil price

Putin's country has become a petrostate. @realDonaldTrump's actions upset the oil markets and push prices higher. It is no doubt not only what he wants; it is what he desperately needs.
5183 2018-07-23 14:32:38 We agree fishmeal must be sourced responsibly. At BioMar we have full traceability of all our fishmeal/fish oil and we do not purchase from this company. Over 80% is certified responsible and the remaining 20% comes from South America from companies on route to certification.

5188 2018-07-23 14:32:22 Adm. Stavridis tells @JoeNBC that if Iranians choke off oil  in reaction to Trump sanctions:"can you spell GAS PRICES RISING and disruption in the oil markets.

5199 2018-07-23 14:31:23 That's called diplomacy and you should be happy getting countries like that bankrolling your banks with low interest rate and given you oil at cheap rate plus i don't think ethiopia will end up paying that.
5200 2018-07-23 14:31:23 A new analysis shows that oil prices could rise to $200 per barrel, and even higher, in the next 12 to 18 months, The Washington Examiner reported.

5203 2018-07-23 14:31:17 For the sake of completeness, I should break that down a bit. If the US decides to go kinetic against Iran, who would pay the highest price?

The United States itself, which would suffer in Iraq, suffer in Bahrain, suffer in Afghanistan, especially with the price of oil spiking.
5204 2018-07-23 14:31:10 Alaskans own 15,482 shares of GULFPORT ENERGY CORP, worth $266,136. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

5214 2018-07-23 14:30:17 Disappointing that oil boilers can still be installed using government funding after the government’s response to the ECO (the Energy Company Obligation) consultation, contradicting the government’s own Clean Growth Strategy on the phasing out of heating oil in the 2020s.
5215 2018-07-23 14:30:08 Wouldn't closure of straits of Hormuz be a big short/mid-term boost to US oil, oil prices and global dollar demand?

5224 2018-07-23 14:28:39 Keep it up.  Shit like this tweet has driven a handful of people I know from your party to mine.  We can handle some more.
5225 2018-07-23 14:28:38 Boltonomics 101: the only guiding principle is if they have oil and aren't white, let's fight.
5226 2018-07-23 14:28:33 Yes and thats the folly of it all he spends a month criticising #OPEC and other country trade policies - gives concessions to Iran importers - gets oil down and than comes out with that in bold letters - truly not understanding markets it seems

5228 2018-07-23 14:28:29 in my opinion fox news is nothing more than an expensive lobbyist for the oil industry, it is used as protection against illegal wars and confiscation of resources through foreign policy decisions enacted in the middle east...
5229 2018-07-23 14:28:19 He was responding to the Iranian threat to attack US infrastructure and shut down the straights to prevent oil exports. Maybe pay attention to whats going on around you.

5231 2018-07-23 14:28:05 Infinite avenues for warped views masquerading as legitimate factual journalism, you mean.  Just a few of the avenues opened: Nazi sites claiming to be 'real news'; quack doctors peddling snake oil as 'real cures'; unhinged crazies claiming the air  is being poisoned as 'real'
5232 2018-07-23 14:28:03 Wtf, look. Im here not to put on an oil into a fire.
I never intended to do such things, for god shakes.

And that's my point. Some of you didn't know is it even a troll or not.

5237 2018-07-23 14:27:42 LOL,,,westminster has propped itself and England up for 40 years with 92% of scots oil revenues.
When scots leave UK that stops.
Be honest did you know it was 92%?
5238 2018-07-23 14:27:25 Quebec has a lot of resources. They would likely start development of their oil and gas industry and become wealthy. They don't now because the rest of the country gives them equalization payments.

5261 2018-07-23 14:25:54 Meh, Democratic politicians like Obama have threatened health insurance companies, oil companies and tobacco companies for years. This proves you only care when Trump does it. Boring.

5290 2018-07-23 14:23:20 Besides, Rouhani didn’t threaten the entire world. The countries who export their oil through Hormoz are mostly Saudi Arabia & UAE, which are behind the US policy of attacking iran, both economically and militarily. An aspect not to be forgotten.
5291 2018-07-23 14:22:56 I'm sure everyone is aware that creating this latest distraction, uncertainty, & chaos is less about Iran, & more abt price of oil (& Mueller). R U suspicious that Russia too is behind this? If things get out of hand, America will be going it alone this time...fool us once...

I never make fancy stuff either but even so it helps with keeping off weight because you can control what you make and how its cooked. Olive oil instead of butter, less sugars, and not eating after 8pm.-
5339 2018-07-23 14:17:38 Trying to drive the price of oil up so Putin can make more money?  Wonder who the silent shareholder of Russian oil is.
5340 2018-07-23 14:17:36 Yes, he will. Russia needs the price of oil to skyrocket.

5353 2018-07-23 14:16:28 Elsewhere, oil prices are higher due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, after President Donald Trump tweeted that the Middle Eastern nation will "suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before," #Boring
5354 2018-07-23 14:16:27 Given the unstable political climate in Venezuela, China now buys its oil from Iran. As does most of Asia including South Korea (and their northern neighbor). Trump probably wants to bomb some Iranian oil fields because he can't match the tariff war he started with China.
5355 2018-07-23 14:16:25 I have so many questions, but the only time you respond to non-media people is when they say

I would love to know exactly what you imagine social studies is like now.

Where does this weird hang up about "not teaching history" come from? What do you think history (as in, the broad concept of "history") is?

5367 2018-07-23 14:15:04 Exactly.  It's Iraq all over only this time will be a world war. Other countries which depend upon Iran's oil will not sit back and watch, nor will Iran be an easy take.
This insane. It would start WWIII.

5370 2018-07-23 14:14:42 lets over react to this mau forest thing,lets thinks beyond that,we cant always cry oohh if the forest is finished kenya going to die.saudi arabia,israel,qatar,uae bahrain name them all.these countries have no forests but  are self sustainable.we just discovered oil in turkana
5371 2018-07-23 14:14:35 This looks like once you start the ball rolling, back out of Iran deal, threaten oil sanctions, they threaten to block oil waterway, higher oil prices, CONFLICT.

5374 2018-07-23 14:14:25 Ma’am the US produces more oil than Iran.
5375 2018-07-23 14:14:23 He needs a war as a distraction, to play big tough talk guy..
But mostly because he wants the OIL.. He said as much during his campaign, that oil should have been seized after all the other Mideast conflicts..

5380 2018-07-23 14:14:07 Lol big man uses big letter to make big words..hmm on Twitter where most likely  the Iranian President may not ever seen. TRUMP has a mentality of a 2 year old, with sociopaths and multipersonality disorders. He made a statement on the campaign trail he would steal Iran oil.
5381 2018-07-23 14:13:54 woww.. For 40 years Iranian regime control its own people and middle east with policy of terror and power of oil. They have enjoyed support of Europe and some American president like Obama....Thank you @realDonaldTrump....#IslamicRegimeMustGo

Never a thought that they would start WWIII.

5389 2018-07-23 14:13:08 Before you purchase and use an essential oil, do some of your own research to see what kind of testing methods the company uses to ensure purity. By educating yourself, you’ll be able to protect your family by only using potent, effective, and pure essential oils.

5393 2018-07-23 14:12:56 On the contrary,I believe it is a cleansing process, to purify and unify the ME world by filtering out all impurities and hypocrisies that were implanted by the colonial era to control its natural resources as oil and NLG. What is happening now is great awareness, new Middle East
5394 2018-07-23 14:12:45 Back home babeeee. Glad to have my dry skin instead of oil slick skin
5395 2018-07-23 14:12:43 @PiyushGoyal sir oil prices have come down in 9 days by 7 dollars per barrel.Where is the corresponding decrease in price in petrol and diesel sir. We the people are glued to the tv 2 see whether there is any decrease offered by govt. Please consider sir.
5396 2018-07-23 14:12:38 They’ll go back to finding ways to suppress their religious differences as they did for centuries before western oil corporations landed, then used divide and conquer tactics to destroy the Middle East. Without petrol dollars, Saudi won’t be able to export Wahhabism.

5398 2018-07-23 14:12:20 Complicit? His music hurt nobody. Meanwhile outrage mob is silent on those complicit in lying USA into war, bombing Libya destroying a nation, oil for food killing 500,000 Iraqi children and supplying Saudi Arabia to bomb starving Yemen.
R.Kelly music is not America’s problem.
5399 2018-07-23 14:12:18 Dollar buying by some foreign banks and importers also weighed on  sentiment. Crude oil prices reversing losses also weighed on the  currency. However, Dollar sales for exporters lent support. The Rupee ended at 68.86 vs. Friday’s close of 68. 85.

5403 2018-07-23 14:11:50 Government bond prices ended lower today as a rise in crude oil prices disrupted appetite on fears of domestic inflation heading higher. Volumes remained muted as traders remained cautious of taking large bets before RBI monetary policy statement August 1.

5411 2018-07-23 14:11:28 Cuba can't afford to pay living wages. The GDP is significantly lower than the official figures because the corrupt & inefficient socialist system can't produce wealth. The regime is surviving on free oil from Venezuela.

5413 2018-07-23 14:11:23 I read the interview by the Iranian president (or whatever his title is). Trump is somehow threatening their ability to move oil.  The Iranian said that they could be the best of friends or the worst of enemies. Can't really blame him, trump wants to rule everyone.
5414 2018-07-23 14:11:22 how to do dis pooooo di jud kom kahibaw mogamit watercolor pwede palang oil painting ay huwat pud ta'g usa ka buwan
5415 2018-07-23 14:11:21 Iran has the OIL that Russia, Trump, greedy old men are determined to have, at all cost to the rest of the world, but especially at cost to US military. It's more lies, false flags to have excuse to attack Iran.
We must resist.
5416 2018-07-23 14:11:18 The tweet demonstrates Trump is unfit to serve. The Iran deal did what it was supposed to do: Stop Iran's nuclear weapons program, combined with unprecedented inspections and oversight. Trump screws it all up. He wants high oil prices for his bro, Putin.
5417 2018-07-23 14:11:12 Trump appears keen to rein in US aggression save for two countries only; Iran and Venezuela. Guess what two countries feature in the list of top four nations with the largest proven oil reserves. Both of course aren't US allies (the others are Saudi Arabia and Canada).
5418 2018-07-23 14:11:05 Isn’t baby oil gel for skin anyway... mess

5424 2018-07-23 14:10:38 Iran has already used DDoS attacks against US banks and has undertaken an aggressive cyber campaign against Saudi oil companies (Aramco and others).  Most expect Iran to step up their cyber campaign after the US withdrawal from the JCPOA.

5445 2018-07-23 14:09:12 Hey Trump... You tub of guts ...don't you know that capital letters means shouting? Plus picking on a battered oil state doesn't really impress anyone ..except maybe Jethro Bodine...but wait...it doesn't have to make sense...you are you..The laughing stock of the entire planet...
5446 2018-07-23 14:09:12 We Americans were born here and even though those damn natives tried and get rid of us we just pushed them into tiny reservations and fracked God's oil over them!!
5447 2018-07-23 14:09:10 Yep, but threatening Iran destabilizes the oil market and drives up the price of oil. All Putin’s money is in oil. Russia’s GDP is less than Texas and does not do much but oil. The trump attack on clean energy, the roll back on auto fuel efficiency is also all about oil money.
5448 2018-07-23 14:09:07 Trump's tweets are great for oil bulls
5449 2018-07-23 14:09:07 Lol...what's his real name?
5450 2018-07-23 14:09:03 We were at Palermo’s, I can’t even remember what the dish was called but it was pasta, chicken, & tiny slices of potatoes smothered in garlic & oil. 
5451 2018-07-23 14:08:51 DOUGLAS, what if the EU were to get nasty by delaying their exports to the UK - just at the beginning of our exit? It wouldn't be long before shortages occur in our shops. Remember the shortage of food and panic buying during our oil blockade in 2000? We could not stop the EU.
5452 2018-07-23 14:08:47 Remember during the campaign when he said the U.S. need to "take back our oil"?

5456 2018-07-23 14:08:40 They just want that sweet oil
5457 2018-07-23 14:08:26 lol I think trump is one! I also think it isn't just about oil anymore w/Autocratic Govts taking control of other Countries Economies-
5458 2018-07-23 14:08:25 So do you have nothing to say regarding Iran protecting its oil from the west?
Its funny how countries who don't want to sell their oil in DOLLARS become terrorist states
5459 2018-07-23 14:08:23 Meanwhile, America’s big everything else (pharma, oil, insurance, Walmart’s sweatshops, Koch Bros, etc.) have been on the Dem’s shit list for decades.

Having Trump on one’s shit list appears to have negative effects on cognition.
5460 2018-07-23 14:08:16 When you find out someone used all the baby oil and you wanted to have a me moment. That kind of morning
5461 2018-07-23 14:08:16 When communities run out of oil like hobbema and poplar, no one going to care. They’ll go where the money is. They’ll pretend to be friends and they’ll hunka until the money runs out. I kinda feel bad for em. All those. fake friends. Damn.
5462 2018-07-23 14:08:12 Just get baby shampoo oil free

and I'm looking forward to the Chinese endow the Muslims with a little Confucian wisdom-
5467 2018-07-23 14:07:49 Nymex wti crude oil CL best SELLING Level is between  $69.60 to $70.10 stop loss $71.21 targets $69.20/$68.90/$68.52/$67.85
5468 2018-07-23 14:07:48 However, Russia aside, China, France, Germany and Great Britain (other signatories to the deal) are getting oil from Iran; President has previously threatened sanctions on any nation that continues to do so.
5469 2018-07-23 14:07:48 I really need some brand new tires and an oil change. So basically I need like $400 dropped on my car.

5477 2018-07-23 14:06:26 I just read a Facebook post Trump might really want a war with Iran preventing oil sales undercutting Russia oil sales and its already faltering markets. The personal connection being Trump’s millions in debts to Russian interests also invested Russian oil. Could this be true?
5478 2018-07-23 14:06:24 Busses  parked on the service road cleaning and dumping all the waste to the lake fencing, also on the road can see lots of oil and grease dirt which fallen due to maint, The fitness cert vehicle remove the reflector ribbons and stickers  can see all around the lake fence
5479 2018-07-23 14:06:04 Then when they call answer with I just got in from checking the oil in the car.... be proactive :)
5480 2018-07-23 14:06:02 New sanctions are about to take effect on Iran, following the president's decision to withdraw from Iran nuclear deal. Aim is to put the squeeze on Iran's leaders, foment dissent, and prevent other countries from buying Iranian oil.

5494 2018-07-23 14:04:00 Stop peer pressuring me. Fyi coconut oil does to my soul.
5495 2018-07-23 14:03:57 So toner, treat, wait for a bit, then pat on oil? :)
5496 2018-07-23 14:03:45 No accident there. Just like the march to war in Iraq, citing WMDs and ignoring arms inspectors saying there were none.

Oil prices rise, good for Russia and American oil interests.
5497 2018-07-23 14:03:44 Bone Spurs twitter threat to Iran, besides deflecting from his treason, also provides a false narrative so that his good friends (though I doubt he has any friends) at the Oil companies, and the traders on Wall Street panic and drive up oil prices.
5498 2018-07-23 14:03:34 Craving a lightly salted pan seared Salmon steak cooked about a quarter of the way through served on a bed of green vegetables cooked al dente and a drizzle of lemon flavored olive oil to garnish.
5499 2018-07-23 14:03:34 China is the next prize in oil and gas exploration and production, this guide is a great tool for an introduction into the potential of that marketplace #ThePrize
5500 2018-07-23 14:03:33 Mostly this is oil prices being up. Which is the global economic cycle + international oil politics (where Trump might get some blame).
5501 2018-07-23 14:03:21 Congratulations ! High time AAI starts giving regular jobs to such talent. Else keep losing them to Oil and Power PSUs.
5502 2018-07-23 14:03:20 痛いチャオぼくなにもしてないのに
5503 2018-07-23 14:03:18 Changed my oil, filled my gas tank up, & took me to salt grass.....okkkkkay.  If you keep acting like this I’ll take your offer up on getting engaged next year.
5504 2018-07-23 14:03:18 why do i suck with oil pastels so much
5505 2018-07-23 14:03:17 I know we swore off sh*a m*isture but I got their Jamaican black castor oil shampoo on sale at Marshall’s for like 1.50 and used it last night with the Aussie 3 min deep conditioner and ended with my Jamaican castor oil hair butter..... the moisture! Omg
5506 2018-07-23 14:03:10 vitamin e oil , cocoa butter , coconut oil
5507 2018-07-23 14:03:01 นั่นสิคะ เป็นไปได้
5508 2018-07-23 14:03:00 We are about to surpass Saudi in oil production. Why would we have any interest in taking anything from Iran? You are misinformed.
5509 2018-07-23 14:02:58 I see him more as a Snake Oil Salesman travelling across the States in a beaten up former tour bus of a failed 70s pop group. Selling hair restoration and hemorrhoid potions
5510 2018-07-23 14:02:34 Imam bayildi. Nice olive oil, garlic, seasoning, bake until soft and unctuous...
5511 2018-07-23 14:02:33 It wouldn't be hard to blockade their oil shipments. Bombing would be unnecessary.
5512 2018-07-23 14:02:32 Trump is itching to get a war going with Iran. His messianic complex is showing; and he is blinded by his support for the Genie Oil Co. of New Jersey and Saudi interests. 

Is the big bad rhetoric really coming from Iran or is it fake news like that chemical attack in Syria.
5513 2018-07-23 14:02:31 I don't dispute i argument yakho.. We also rediculed for the same Ish but we are the richest club.... Was just asking about the Oil Part
5514 2018-07-23 14:02:26 I for one am looking forward to a diet of sugar beet drizzled with rape seed oil

5516 2018-07-23 14:02:23 The Arab World is at its weakest point for several decades: infighting, sectarian wars, a looming oil crisis, unemployment crisis & water crisis.

& things might get worse. 

Saudi Arabia might have a few more decades to bribe the US with $100 billion arms deals, but that's it.

5520 2018-07-23 14:01:48 a bitch can never visit the repair shop for JUST an oil change. fuck your maintenance check that’s telling me the whole damn car is broken.
5521 2018-07-23 14:01:44 Do you now any car company today that also has its own upstream, midstream and downstream oil operations?
5522 2018-07-23 14:01:42 I’m really wondering if I can sleep in my car while they do the oil change..

5533 2018-07-23 14:00:24 A1 between junction Munsbach and junction Cargo-Center broken down vehicle, danger, oil on road, danger, one lane blocked #ACL_A1
5534 2018-07-23 14:00:17 Not just Russia. High oil prices create space for profit for the less efficient extraction practices like tar sands in the US and Canada. They are passing out money to their wealthy donors also.

5541 2018-07-23 13:59:59 My brother asked me where he could get argan oil or any other oil that's good for his hair. About a year ago I gave him my bottle of Tarte maracuja oil because I didn't like it, but he used it for his hair and now he wants more.

I'm really happy he's making an effort uwu
5542 2018-07-23 13:59:51 Taurus told me to keep my protein the same, cut my carbs by 50g, & to increase my fat by 50g. He’s like “take some MCT oil, if you can’t fit in food”...

Why he doesn’t ever tell me the horrible side effects of his suggestions, I’ll never understand. This shit got my stomach GOIN

5550 2018-07-23 13:58:53 I could say the same for your representative Cedric Richmond and the tax-in-Chief Governor Edwards. Who would ever threaten to close LSU instead of reducing spending? Where are the oil related jobs? Businesses are moving out of the state. Can’t blame Trump for that!

5554 2018-07-23 13:58:34 1/2 Engines are good, but they're shell mains so not as bullet proof as the roller bearing 1100. The only real weakness is the electrics, charging side in particular. If the oil level is allowed to run low the stator overheats.
5555 2018-07-23 13:58:27 You and plenty of others, seen more and more on Twitter coming out this isn't same as first ref this is constitutional change of the worst kind.

5556 2018-07-23 13:58:26 That’s not true, I read China is replacing USA oil with Iranian oil.

5559 2018-07-23 13:58:07 Now I see what putin and trumputo discussed in private,,  start trouble with Iran regarding oil in favor of Russian oil. That's my take

5567 2018-07-23 13:57:32 If oil is God’s gift why does it pollute the air when burned and why does it slowly suffocate any animal that has the misfortune to come in contact with it?

God’s fucked up if this is a “gift”.

5569 2018-07-23 13:57:27 Just have flora or that olive oil stuff all them old Italian fellas have in that advert. Stop spoiling butter.
5570 2018-07-23 13:57:24 Or sometimes those “successful” people are just mobbed up snake oil salesmen who have turned bankruptcies, lawsuits, and defaulting on debt into the new definition of “successful”. Cheating doesn’t make you a winner, it makes you corrupt.
5571 2018-07-23 13:57:19 whats even crazier is Haiti ye still has vast reserves of gold oil and diamonds inside her unexplored. America and other countries know this but dont want haiti to realize this by portray haiti out to be poor. But the truth is haiti rich beyond what ppl think and know
5572 2018-07-23 13:57:12 I was sleeping last night and woke up  to my dad praying and putting oil in my mouth  this is getting out of hand 
5573 2018-07-23 13:57:00 Big difference between NK and Iran, has oil. Republicans have been making nurse about war with Iran since Bush. It was Scott Walkers platform. This is not Trump posturing, this is dangerous.

5575 2018-07-23 13:56:42 I can understand why okra is much reviled. It's also an acquired taste. This S. Indian version starts with mustard seeds, red pepper flakes and white urad dal added to 1tbs oil. Okra added after mustard pops. Salt and turmeric during cooking. That's all.

5584 2018-07-23 13:56:05 I just love getting my dad into trouble with mom! My dad was pouring oil in a bottle but spilled it while doing so! My mom quickly rushed to help him! Then i told mom," If you spilled oil there would be a World War 3 but Dad did it so no Problem!"

5591 2018-07-23 13:55:19 Im not sure he is aware that farmers are moderately intelligent and have in part survived in our harsh environment by having remarkably well tuned bullshit filters. We apply them to 'snake oil salesmen' regulary. It isnt hard to re-tune them, so to speak, to politics.
5592 2018-07-23 13:55:17 As a practical matter, only about 300,000 bbl of Iran oil will be taken off the market.
Not a significant amount.
5593 2018-07-23 13:55:13 Nope. The current Iranian ledearship is the result of US regime change of 1953, removing the prime minister to put the shah at the head of Iran and get the oil.
US can fu*k up with their regim change, Iranians have to decide for themselves.
5594 2018-07-23 13:55:10 Umm he already has. Welcome to the real Helsinki & Putin meeting. No money release from EU to Iran AND Russia, China and EU NOT buying Iranian Oil. How do you like them apples???
5595 2018-07-23 13:55:04 Self driving cars are going to be disasterous for millions of people across the world who currently drive for a living. Or just think of the millions of oil workers that are going to be put out of a job by Fusion power. Stop progress now.

5600 2018-07-23 13:54:08 Please stop w/the fantasy that the #MushyMiddle will save us.
One reason for Trump's rise is that he gave people something to vote FOR. (Yes, he lied; yes, he demagogued. DUH)
Offer the same mushy centrism (lovely for Wall Street, Big Oil, Insurance industry) & voters stay home.
5601 2018-07-23 13:54:05 Fold in ten ounces of olive oil then set timer for 3 minutes.
5602 2018-07-23 13:54:02 In fact I believe that it’s necessary in order to be the party of diversity to have actual diversity within our caucus. We aren’t extremists looking for more oil For which to start a war. We are moving to the 21st century dragging conservatives along side.
5603 2018-07-23 13:54:02 No they dont!,they know Israel would wipe them out as an example to others who might want to attack Israel.
Iran has seen what the west did to Iraq and want nukes to stop US IN THE WEST from stealing thier oil,,can you blame them for that?
5604 2018-07-23 13:53:59 A proper chairman makes the best business decisions that don't put the business in financial risk.

5605 2018-07-23 13:53:55 I'm using that at my next oil change.
5606 2018-07-23 13:53:48 Tensions of the sort created by this tweet jack up oil prices: good for Russia!
5607 2018-07-23 13:53:46 I really think he's also promised Donald a cut of the $$$ from artic oil drilling (with Enron) once the sanctions are lifted.
5608 2018-07-23 13:53:45 I suppose the oil used on cycle chains isn't polluting our streets?

5625 2018-07-23 13:52:37 Trump’s unfettered support of big oil and an end to support of Qatar. War with Iran.
5626 2018-07-23 13:52:32 The seven emirates, which have a population of more than nine million, are not rich in oil and gas, with the exception of Abu Dhabi, where wealth is concentrated and distributed to other emirates, including Dubai, That the dominant ruler is Abu Dhabi, which manages the resources
5627 2018-07-23 13:52:28 I was so far west the weekend I started invading other countries for oil
5628 2018-07-23 13:52:25 Sounds like Trump wants to jack oil prices... threats and/or war will do that in the region... I’m betting this is a way for Trump to make money - influence the markets because he knows he can.

5630 2018-07-23 13:52:16 Too many studies/media headlines declaring "fish oils useless" based on lower dose trials.

5656 2018-07-23 13:50:07 This [addition of the bowl to the candlestick, causing it to yield a ceaseless supply of oil from the olive trees] is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit [of Whom the oil is a symbol], says the Lord of hosts.

5657 2018-07-23 13:49:54 Мне только биотин видимый эффект дал, может, еще скрабы для кожи головы (можно делать самой, даже простой солью/сахаром). На айхерб еще продается magnesium oil, многим помогает
5658 2018-07-23 13:49:51 yes, and strong oil price gives producers more flexibility to shut-in some dry gas wells
5659 2018-07-23 13:49:49 I don’t know what to believe. Iran is a very rich country, with oil and other minerals, as well a strategic country. There is a possibility that he is just using the protests to get more power in the region. I hope for the very best, I hope the regime falls, and the mullahs dies.
5660 2018-07-23 13:49:41 Now you’re tough? From over the pond? In the middle of the night? My guess is you’d give the Iranians a nice discount on oil in person.  What a tough  POTUS we have! The noose is tightening and there’s nothing you can do about it anymore.

5661 2018-07-23 13:49:39 Can you recommend a healthy oil for me besides coconut oil; It makes me nauseous and sick. Fatty foods in general makes me nauseous.
5662 2018-07-23 13:49:34 Awww, I get it.
There's no more oil on your side of the sandpit.
It's time-out time for you, Mister!

5672 2018-07-23 13:49:01 Webo, mayo y coconut oil.
5673 2018-07-23 13:49:00 Yes, before the first test he was eating lots of cream and coffee. So, we did what you told me anf gave up those. He's still eating oils (olive oil) in homemade mayo and butter but in small amounts because I don't know how to reach his calories without fats.

5686 2018-07-23 13:48:06 Trump has always seen middle eastern oil as an opportunity for plunder. He tried to make a case for Iraqi oil.

5688 2018-07-23 13:48:02 So all of those small tax break to the middle class are just going to big industry... Big oil... anyway.  

They rigged it so it's was another give away to the rich.  The money just gets laundered through the poor filling their gas tanks.

5696 2018-07-23 13:46:52 Then you throw in the sanctions which would seriously hurt their oil sales.  A crushed Iranian economy could spark a 2nd green revolution.

No reason Iran can't have the economy of Saudi Arabia.

5716 2018-07-23 13:45:12 The State is not smart enough to figure out that the cure for high oil prices is high oil prices. In their HFT War against commodities they have held most commodities below the cost of production with their HFT Price Controls. Now comes the pain.

5722 2018-07-23 13:44:41 The wildcards are Turkey and Russia. Turkey is making an effort to become the next Iran.  Russia would benefit greatly from oil market instability, and probably stall all efforts to remove the mullahs until their western pil/gas customers run out of money and patience.

5766 2018-07-23 13:39:19 First of all, independence costs a bloody fortune. At least the Scots have got whiskey, oil and the nuke bases.  A few blankets from Llanwooley isn’t going to pay the bills  is it? #walesinde

5771 2018-07-23 13:38:43 I forgot how much i loved vitamin E oil
5772 2018-07-23 13:38:37 Not if they switch from taking US dollars for oil to another currency which they were about to do before the Iraq war. The dollar is so powerful because everyone trades oil in dollars which means if you want oil you have to do business in the US system
5773 2018-07-23 13:38:37 Hi, Kyla! Coconut oil + don't use any products (shampoo, soap, etc.) with sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate. I use Dr. Woods castile soap with shea butter. I don't even need to moisturize.
5774 2018-07-23 13:38:35 Actually is not good to scrub the tongue. Change your diet and oil pull. That white stuff on the tongue is nothing but material from the food you intake ie processed foods meat etc

5778 2018-07-23 13:38:12 So do we! on a much larger scale.
Can you blame Iran for wanting nukes when they see what happened to Iraq?
They dont want to attack Israel,they are not stupid,they want to protect thier oil FROM US IN THE WEST!

Watch out seabirds tho!
5786 2018-07-23 13:37:12 By keeping pressure on Iran it slows the release of their oil onto the world market, in turn keeping prices high, which is exactly what Putin wants/needs. @realDonaldTrump #RussoRepublican

5796 2018-07-23 13:35:17 TRAIN will only be deemed "good" if it's wholesome in its benefits. The Duterte economic managers need to understand that the common people are drowning in heightening inflation ---partially inflated by TRAIN--- because of increasing price of oil in the world market.

5804 2018-07-23 13:34:09 Well, curtailing someone’s ability is to sell oil in which some proceeds go to feed its people is kind of like starting a war

5810 2018-07-23 13:33:54 Trump wanted to start a T.V. Network, intended to capitalize off of his presidential bid. What he would have made off of the media venture would far outweigh the “peanuts” lost elsewhere. It didn’t go to plan, now on to Act 2: Oil, China, etc.
5811 2018-07-23 13:33:49 What happens when they find out that life as we know it couldn’t exist without carbon? Maybe an organic chemistry course tax?
5812 2018-07-23 13:33:46 Yes, Greg, but oil contributes more money to the economy since oil is an engorged business after decades of manufactured dependence and, in, by-products.

So, the science is: more money now is better than a livable future.

Or something.
5813 2018-07-23 13:33:46 I wish every oil producing country had a nuke and delivery system. Then trump would be willing to negotiate. It is also a lesson for Kim. Never denuclearize. 
Iran should stand ground. It's a great country. It should rally support of Russia and China and engage European nations.

Iran should stand ground. It's a great country. It should rally support of Russia and China and engage European nations.
5815 2018-07-23 13:33:31 Trump is threatening to kill women and children for oil.
5816 2018-07-23 13:33:20 Weren't the oil gurus back in the late 80s early 90s predicting a oil supply isuue because we would reach a tipping point of declining production around 2010? We've been oversupplied the past few years. I digress, industries should be looking at hydrogen for the future.
5817 2018-07-23 13:33:14 I’ll burn you with boiling oil, and I’ll smile while your skin sizzles and burns.  nothing bring me more pleasure than this thought
5818 2018-07-23 13:33:10 Correct on praying mantis, and yes, it was called off prematurely.  We had military helos flying off closed oil rigs to make patrols back then.

5844 2018-07-23 13:30:28 Oil prices cannot rise to such levels.The collapse in demand would tank economies worldwide.Something called demand inelasticities.

5909 2018-07-23 13:24:45 Lot of Oil analyst including me busy to closely monitor The strait of Hormuz - strategic chokepoint of Oil passage which Iran is threatening to block post Trump's tweet. Mr Trump, you made the engagement.

5911 2018-07-23 13:24:38 It's just bullshit speculation.  Something like the Gold & Silver hawkers on TV.  There are vast stretches of Canada that have untapped oil and gas reserves.  There are centuries of reserves, still in the ground.

5931 2018-07-23 13:22:14 Sam, the arms deal lawyer is a snake oil salesman. Deeply implicated in the corruption. One of Zuma’s minions. Now disgruntled because Thales didn’t pay his cut - disguised as a commission. When Judge Yacoob grilled him at civil society hearings he refused to testify further.
5932 2018-07-23 13:22:11 I take it you've missed all the news about Big Tobacco/Oil/Pharma/Bio/Sugar funding research that is selectivly chosen to either sow doubt where there is none, or give false bias to their arguments, and use that to lobby for their will above that of the general public?
5933 2018-07-23 13:22:09 And Oil prices up?
5934 2018-07-23 13:22:04 According to Tabernaemontanus (1731), garlic and pepper are excellent herbs to treat a toothache; Leonhart Fuchs (1543) suggests rose oil instead of rose honey for an ear infection.
5935 2018-07-23 13:21:51 Because I’m odd: why is it that some people with pale skin who despise anything immigrant or of any other race at this time of year go to beaches in droves to cover their body in oil and bake in the sun in an effort to become brown?

5943 2018-07-23 13:21:28 Meanwhile, I don't know whether we "have to" revive the automotive policy, but we need to turn Nigeria into a net exporter of much more than just crude oil.

Making Nigeria a production hub is basically the only way to do that.

Automobiles are just a part of that plan.

5995 2018-07-23 13:16:18 That's true, also nearly all of the increase can be blamed on OPEC's decision to begin tightening oil supply starting Jan 2017 (and still ongoing, though they scaled back the cut last month) that led to higher oil prices.
5996 2018-07-23 13:16:17 95.65 might be the dollar top at WH. Adding oil and nasdaq shorts.
5997 2018-07-23 13:16:15 Nobody is siding with Iran, but this was totally predictable. 

Trump backs out of an working deal he doesn’t understand promising a new deal he can’t deliver. Then threatens Iran with oil sanctions that are acts of war. Then escalates when Iran says it will respond in kind.
5998 2018-07-23 13:16:09 It would be catastrophic. The straits of Hormuz would be rendered unnavigable within days causing huge oil shortages and price spikes and big damage to global economy. Not to mention any other Iranian countermeasures including Air attacks on Gulf States eg Bahrain then KSA etc
5999 2018-07-23 13:15:53 #The crucial  question then, for you at this time is, are you in a position to capitalize on these opportunities?

6012 2018-07-23 13:13:38 So our gov’t wants to help the Iranian people who are oppressed but does nothing about our own neighbors desperate for help. Is that because South America doesn’t have as much oil or because Iranians aren’t as brown?

6032 2018-07-23 13:11:21 No need to keep blowing up countries, especially Iran... just suffocate their oil buyers and they will collapse. But then again that doesn't profit the war machine and deep state.

6035 2018-07-23 13:10:59 Is this what Russia wants, Mr. Trump? Or do you just want the oil? Do we really want another war?
6036 2018-07-23 13:10:52 If Putin can successfully drive a wedge between the United States and current suppliers, he can create a situation where Russian oil is more valuable.

Those suppliers include Canada and Mexico.  Do you see where I'm going with this?

6042 2018-07-23 13:09:57 Really? Theresa May only formalised our negotiating position 2 weeks ago, having dithered for 2 years. The EU dismantled it in 2 mins. The contradictions from the snake oil salesmen and other rediculous 'red lines', make the whole thing unworkable...

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
6056 2018-07-23 13:08:53 Kind of like us trying to get away from eastern oil, Texas now becoming a powerhouse with petroleum. Why do we not look more and more inward for goods and services rather than looking outside our shores? Does that not increase jobs and economy? Made in the USA?
6057 2018-07-23 13:08:52 How do you make that basil oil it looks delicious. The only recipe I know is to steep leaves in oil and remove but yours looks like you have chopped leaves left in?

6085 2018-07-23 13:05:41 A quick check that is useful is to look at pop share of UK figures as other than oil - should be close. However look at what happened with SDLT - SG ended up receiving much less than pop share when they introduced LBTT.
6086 2018-07-23 13:05:38 Trump killed Russian mercenaries in Syria. He's got the u.s. pumping so much oil to the world now it's crushing Russia's economy and they're trying to get OPEC to decrease prod. so $ of oil goes back up and to crush the u.s. frackers but it won't work. The tech is too good.
6087 2018-07-23 13:05:36 The fact Bolton has been trying to nuke Iran for 15 years and Iran’s Gulf control and cheaper oil export is a direct threat to Putin/Russia economically coupled with Trump under Putin’s heel....I’d say the odds are less than a Scaramucci.

6125 2018-07-23 13:01:49 @HurdOnTheHill The President is rattling his saber towards Iran. IMO, the reason is that if Iran cuts off the oil supply, we get played into Russia’s hand. The President is not deranged. He is a greedy conniving snake. You can speak to this!

6167 2018-07-23 12:57:57 He wants oil prices up, because that is what Putin wants.
6168 2018-07-23 12:57:54 I was queasy about stock's past correlation to oil prices, so I only made a token investment through my robinhood account. (I'm against oil-dependent energy investments in general) But probably I was wrong.
6169 2018-07-23 12:57:48 A customer with Turrets Syndrome gets CBD Oil from my Pharmacy. After one week of use, he reported that, “My tics are either gone or are so negligible that I don’t notice them”.
6170 2018-07-23 12:57:47 I had a hard time with patchouli as a teen. Could not get with it. And it was the most mentioned incense/oil in what I was reading (aside from sandalwood) I still prefer sandalwood to patchouli. Though I’m okay with both now 
6171 2018-07-23 12:57:42 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency.

6172 2018-07-23 12:57:36 What exactly was Iran’s threat?  That they will clog the oil flow?
6173 2018-07-23 12:57:33 You really believe this oil painting!
6174 2018-07-23 12:57:18 Yes and to destroy Iran so as to steal their vast oil resources. It's amazing how quickly Americans forget what we did to Iraq based on a huge lie. And now Genie oil is pumping oil out of Iraq and the billionaires sit back laughing at the 99% who gave their lives and or money.

6187 2018-07-23 12:56:22 If Iran blockades the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping route for Middle East oil, the price of USA gasoline will rise.

The truth is, while we cannot profit from everything, we can pay attention & prepare.
6189 2018-07-23 12:56:13 I agree. Solar is the future, wind works too. But your party is hooked on coal, oil, and an oligarchy whose only aspiration is to gain more. So what's a poor municipality to do?

6223 2018-07-23 12:53:41 This should come as no surprise. Every fan base has a % of tools that do this kind of thing but the unfortunate part w/ a place like EDM, there are more of them that follow the team. All goes back to the jealousy angle of what players get paid & people not recognizing boundaries.
6224 2018-07-23 12:53:30 Did you know that no one wanted the Oil block as at the time it was awarded, because of the high volume of water? Also, Mrs Alakija was a fashion designer as at the time her family was awarded the oil blocks during IBB regime...
6225 2018-07-23 12:53:28 Trump already sanctioned the hell out of Iran!After NATO & Putin summit,why is Iran barking louder than usual?Trump must’ve pushed 4 tighter sanctions &pressure of Iran in Syria with Russia.Note the push to stop buying Iranian oil worldwide & Saudi glad to fill in Iranian shares

6257 2018-07-23 12:49:32 Putin ordered Trump to destabilize oil supplies from Iran   with threats, cancelling Iran’s supply agreement or god forbid, war against Iran.   Whichever, oil prices will rise exponentially and Russia will benefit.  Get ready to pay a lot more for your gas America.
6258 2018-07-23 12:49:19 Iran is involved in troop activity in Syria as well as funding and arming hezbollah, causing trouble in Iraq and Yemen.  All active fighting areas in conflict with USA or our allies plus missile development. Funded with money from the b.o. Deal and new revenue from oil sales
6259 2018-07-23 12:49:19 Meanwhile, OIL prices will jump which benefits Putin&RU oligarchs, as well as all of DJT's other good (heavily energy mkt invested) buddies.

6263 2018-07-23 12:49:02 All this Iran TWEETING — maybe it’s part of a weird ass oil stocks play to help one of Trump’s swamp rats. That’s the kind of thought that now surfaces with this administration. Carl Icahn, call your office.
6264 2018-07-23 12:48:38 Maybe Iran can offer Trump a hotel, a few words of praises, and an oil deal and we can then be friends?#TrumpNuts

6279 2018-07-23 12:46:12 Trump is looking for anything that will distract the media away from him or the works of the border patrols and corporations on families He might even start a war with Iran and drive the price of oil over 200 to collapse the economy.
6280 2018-07-23 12:46:04 When he visits the White House are you going to show off the Presidents Panic Room?  Putin is a trained KGB agent. He learns secrets simply by how you blink. You are a trained Snake Oil Salesman.
6281 2018-07-23 12:46:01 I say stop the oil exports with embargoes and watch them change their tune.
6282 2018-07-23 12:46:00 You also have a ruling elite in Russia, many of whom were also part of the old Soviet system and liked that level of control. In Iran, well, we probably should have told the Shah he was on his own in retrospect and thanks for the billions in deeply discounted oil

6286 2018-07-23 12:45:33 My skin gets so oily in this weather. I am considering starting an oil business.
6287 2018-07-23 12:45:06 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.
6288 2018-07-23 12:44:53 But it will help Russia with higher oil prices.
6289 2018-07-23 12:44:52 I could foresaw that in 2014. Putin not only added substantial Black Sea coastline with the occupation of Crimea & Abkhazia...but also the portion of the Black Sea that goes with it. Economic zone. Territorial waters. Look at the map. Fishing, oil, gas, everything.
6290 2018-07-23 12:44:49 We have farly trucks, vassells and pipelines to sell Iran oil to USA and Europe.

6293 2018-07-23 12:44:29 It only needs to use its now vast influence to pursuade the world to start buying and selling oil in Euros, and the entire US empire will collapse like a house of cards in a light breeze! #wato
6294 2018-07-23 12:44:28 I fry it in coconut oil until it's golden before I add it to the curry - helps it to keep it's shape and adds to the flavour! It's so much easier to cook with that I'd thought it would be ... I guess I expected it to be like tofu and it's a completely different thing!

BE CAUTIOUS!
6300 2018-07-23 12:43:40 Oil. Why is it always about oil? Sometimes I think the universe is playing a long game of Catan, and Steve the Starmaker only knows one strategy.
6301 2018-07-23 12:43:40 There are other costs like ethanol,admin costs,distribution costs and margins to the oil companies.
6302 2018-07-23 12:43:31 He’s flipping out cause the Iranians are getting ready to close the waterway the Saudis/US use to get oil out.  If that happens the gas prices will spike up. Trump will be blamed. This is in addition to the tariffs he imposed which Americans are really going to feel around Nov.

6378 2018-07-23 12:35:52 Va needs to open up its offshore capabilities and stop leaving it up to the Gulf Coast states to produce oil. Maybe that would drive down the cost of diesel and keep us from buying overseas oil

6396 2018-07-23 12:33:33 You are right that increasing oil prices contributed to the inflation but quantify it. Don’t tell us that the 5% inflation rate is all due to oil.

  Do not think for one second that there will be a meeting with Iran’s leader like there was for North Korea. 
They have no nukes. 
They do not have a powerful trade ally like China. 
There is no “hostage city” near by.
They have oil for the taking. 
This could get ugly.

6403 2018-07-23 12:32:48 I agree, no oil is better than some oil. But olive oil will be better than other options when it has to be used. Dr. Davis also encourages minimal if not zero oil. The benefits of oleocanthal can be found by just eating real olives.

For Russia:

1. Granting Russia all Arctic Sea oil rights.
2. Destruction of NATO.
3. Making G& into G8.
4. Ceding to Russia of Crimea, rest of Ukraine, Baltic states.

For USA:

You want to do it again.

6436 2018-07-23 12:28:46 Whose great idea was it to make a oil change at 8am. 
6437 2018-07-23 12:28:44 Whats divisive about running your own country?
WM has over 40 years near bankriputed an oil rich UK and you want scots to stick with that horrendous mismanagement?
6438 2018-07-23 12:28:36 I need to get an oil change

6441 2018-07-23 12:28:24 OIL!!!!!
6442 2018-07-23 12:28:21 Remember Amarica we couldn't defeat Irac and Iran the first time when Bush tried to take there oil from them the same way they took America from the Indians and Trumps acting now the same way they acted then, please don't let him take you down for down he's going.
6443 2018-07-23 12:28:13 Russia oligarchs need oil prices to rise to obtain huge returns on their oil investments funded by illegal banking. Middle East unrest will do this. Trump's main purpose is to make this happen. RU has oil too.
6444 2018-07-23 12:28:06 Ever had just angel hair with extra virgin olive oil and sautéed garlic and crushed Rep pepper with lots of shaved Parmesan. Soooo yummy.. I use edamame pasta too! Delicious
6445 2018-07-23 12:27:58 @realDonaldTrump Mr. POTUS, how do you like the oil prices now?
6446 2018-07-23 12:27:54 WPP is a great project, its business plan includes converting to clean HHO energy as many as possible of the world’s 20,000+ polluting Coal, Oil, Natural Gas and Gasoline Power Plants. #WPP ENERGY #ico.

6449 2018-07-23 12:27:33 This is not hard to understand. In Helsinki, Putin gave Trump his orders to destabilize oil supplies from Iran.  Oil prices will rise exponentially and Russia will benefit.  Get ready to pay a lot more for your gas America and don’t forget to thank Trump and Putin.
6450 2018-07-23 12:27:22 I have normal but sometimes it gets a bit dry!

double cleanse every morning, then tone (witch hazel), and then moisturize! Every now and then I use sunflower oil to lighten some past pimple marks. Every week i try to use a face mask (Skinfood's Rice Wash off mask is the bomb!)

6458 2018-07-23 12:26:07 128 divided by 4 is 32 so yeah, that sounds about right. 1 tbs plus some change. Might make it 1 tbs 1 tsp just to be on the stronger side. Neem oil won’t hurt humans or plants, in any case.

6460 2018-07-23 12:25:59 "Mr. Rouhani had earlier threatened the possible disruption of regional oil shipments if its own exports were blocked by United States sanctions."
6461 2018-07-23 12:25:56 He’s wanted the oil there for years. Thinks it how to solve the national debt.
6462 2018-07-23 12:25:55 Oh, he's not afraid to offer up a huge media distraction that would also spike oil prices, to the direct benefit of his favorite petrostate? Courageous.
6463 2018-07-23 12:25:55 On day 1 he said in front of the CIA Memorial Wall that maybe we'd get another chance to take the oil

6467 2018-07-23 12:25:30 Hey we have oil. Crazy idea, let’s invest in clean energy and reduce our dependence on other countries. What else does Iran sell us other than oil? #bankruptcy
6468 2018-07-23 12:25:26 It’s personal preeerence. I got recommend bepanthen by some people, but I used coconut oil instead. Wash the tattoo twice a day with warm soapy water and apply coconut oil whenever you need to rehydrate the skin! Keep it aired out as much as you can, and if you’re going -

You may not take Trump seriously but Iranians do.

Tapi Pertamina harus eksekusi subsidi, harus buat keseragaman harga.

Ini berat.

6480 2018-07-23 12:24:24 “Suggests?” Of course that’s what it was. Those sanctions killed a half-trillion dollar deal between Exxon and Rosneft (Russian state-run oil co) so the #1 priority was always removing the sanctions. Nominating Tillerson was pretty much the most overt way to reveal their intent
6481 2018-07-23 12:23:47 As a child of the 60s I remember having to get visas to travel abroad, not being able to take more than £25 out the country. Olive oil only at chemists, pasta only in tins. Great times, eh?

6484 2018-07-23 12:23:42 Get rid of the white bread and mayo, add a crusty roll, Genoa, provolone, and some peppers then drizzle olive oil and you’ve got a sandwich.

6490 2018-07-23 12:22:37 Actually, the nuttiest part about Trumpism is that he's a 'populist' authoritarian demagogue who doesn't actually deliver *anything* concrete to the masses. If he was lowering heating oil prices or redistributing land or...it'd make more sense.

6518 2018-07-23 12:18:55 Because Iran is under sanctions & that means less oil in the market which makes oil more valuable.

6525 2018-07-23 12:17:26 also Olive Oil, Extra Virgin
6526 2018-07-23 12:17:24 Biggest beneficiary of Iran tension is Russia.  Once sanctions are placed on Iran oil export, the price goes up and Russia will reap the benefit of higher oil prices.  That's the end game in all of this.
6527 2018-07-23 12:17:20 Only reason Israel helped is to get rid of them so it can continue its covert undermining of the area.  There are huge oil and mineral resources in the area and they have contracts with Trump supported corporations to exploit the region for profit.

6531 2018-07-23 12:16:55 Classic excuse. Sadly it sold out in a flash. What can I say? People really are perverts. The “Workout Like a Superhero” has been brought in as a way of adding more oil him ups.
6532 2018-07-23 12:16:52 Ten years ago I said the phrase 'peak oil' over continental breakfast to some oilman Yank in a hotel lobby in Manila - He laughed at me and told me that in in a few years the US would be on top of world producers of oil.
6533 2018-07-23 12:16:45 Eisenhower said the oil was of vital importance to our national security. And coincidentally he also gave them their nuclear materials.
6534 2018-07-23 12:16:37 same way you showed him documents on budget padding. To what end ?
6535 2018-07-23 12:16:36 That used to be a common thing in the countryside oil and red diesel.  I'd have thought security would have been developed to protect from this sort of thing.  Essential given by their nature that properties using oil can be a wee bit isolated.  Is that allegedly stolen or proven

6541 2018-07-23 12:15:42 @UBS 1/3: US President Trump sent out a tweet threatening Iran with all sorts  of dire consequences if Iran is mean about the US. The tweet used lots  and lots of capital letters. The oil market, understandably reacted –  oil prices fell a tiny bit. #forex #fx #forextrading #USD
6542 2018-07-23 12:15:42 what are the chances oil shoots to 100 in no time just like it did in 1990s ..it was a july too. just like now
6543 2018-07-23 12:15:37 Great, keep stirring up trouble in the world why don't you. Oil crisis coming to the world very soon, leading to war, all because of Trump's babyish behavior

6564 2018-07-23 12:12:33 Because of oil money, Saudi Arabia is rich, both in aggregate and per capita; so it should be considered a 1st world nation. On the other hand, because of its huge population, China is rich in aggregate but borderline medium or poor per capita, so 2nd world status is about right.

6576 2018-07-23 12:10:50 Inflation is happening not just in the PH and if you will check, it's because of oil (demand/pull factor). That's why peso is going down the drain. I'm not saying it's a good news, but how come the predicted growth of our country continuous to soar?
6577 2018-07-23 12:10:43 also coconut oil etc works

6583 2018-07-23 12:10:00 @SquawkCNBC selective reporting with the intent of a blue wave in November is the bigger threat to the stock market, not the price of oil.

6591 2018-07-23 12:09:20 BreakingNews: Buhari begs OFFA Bank robbery gang leader to stay in APC. Offers him and his corrupt gang in senate oil wells.
6592 2018-07-23 12:09:18 Calm down mechanic guy. Just here for an oil change. If I wanted to know about all the other stuff wrong with my car I'd turn the radio down.
6593 2018-07-23 12:09:08 Regime change= US always trying to bully other countries for their oil
6594 2018-07-23 12:08:49 Read about the World order after world war 2, how much help Iran received from America in 1940s, 50s, and 60s. Who helped Iran take Azerbaijan back from Soviet Russia. Who helped our oil industry in 50s, 60s and 70s, who educated our best people during the same period. AMERICA
6595 2018-07-23 12:08:44 Absolutely, we ignore Russia at our own peril. The elephant in the room with Syria is a very unsavoury oil deal Assad did with Putin which only serves to line Russian pockets and deprive the Syrian people of the benefits of oil revenues.
6596 2018-07-23 12:08:35 Unless the domestic foreign politics involves the country in questions decision to stop using USD to sell its oil and attempt to move over to the Euro. Then we interfere. Then we support regime change.
6597 2018-07-23 12:08:32 @realDonaldTrump Come on DJT, we know threatening Iran, boosts the price of oil and helps your “friend” Putin! Iran deserves the right to self determination just like North Korea. You’re telegraphing your punches sir!!
6598 2018-07-23 12:07:53 the 5 RICHEST families in the country have been FIXING oil prices i mean who do they think theyre fooling?
6599 2018-07-23 12:07:36 Please tell me more about the oil industry - which I was in for 3 decades.
6600 2018-07-23 12:07:34 The leader of Russia has attacked and is continuing to attack America,. Trump rolled over for him like a fat orange cuck. But now he needs to distract the media & spike oil prices to help his favorite petrostate - the one that attacked us - so he tries to start a war on Twitter.
6601 2018-07-23 12:07:28 Lain rjud bsta ma change oil 
6602 2018-07-23 12:07:26 Here's the deal:  Putin gets Trump elected, Trump makes Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson Sec. Of State, Putin gets his 500 billion oil deal + a POTUS who refuses to enforce sanctions.  Everyone wins.  Except the American people.
6603 2018-07-23 12:07:25 STFU!U would be stupid enuff to pick on a country.Majority of its arms are from the 60s.U don't scare them people with yur dickless rhetoric,They will shut down the flow of oil and destroy more tankers before u can get off yur toilet,(yur throne)dumbass!
6604 2018-07-23 12:07:19 Yes   He is divulging the dirty secret that trump is a snake oil salesman.   You need to stand down
6605 2018-07-23 12:07:06 Few things make me really angry (although being falsely accused of an awful crime comes close) but finding out one of my neighbours has been stealing heating oil from my tank definitely does

6609 2018-07-23 12:06:34 OIL IS WHY Russia and Putin insisted on Rex Tillerson, the CEO OF #ExxonMobil, 
as SEC'Y OF STATE @StateDept, because Tillerson was partners and NEIGHBORS w/ Igor Sechin, the CEO of Russian-owned oil company Rosneft--2nd most powerful man in Russia. 

SO THIS IS DEEP CORRUPTION.
6610 2018-07-23 12:06:33 When oil hits $400 a barrel, you'll WISH you had had the insight to invest in huge Texas ranches covered in oil wells. And #Antifa will laugh at you Trumplicans again and again!

Ugh I love this method or mix 2-3 drops of peppermint and tea tree Essential oil in your conditioner and detangle your hair.
6616 2018-07-23 12:05:42 Hay algo que no entiendo: los consumidores de series se vuelven locos por la vida de Luis Miguel, pero no se inmutan ante El Mecanismo, una serie que muestra el esquema de corrupción que involucra a Petrobras (National Oil Company) y que la causa no logra avanzar 
6617 2018-07-23 12:05:40 loreal extraordinary oil
6618 2018-07-23 12:05:35 Please research from non biosources what the United States and the UK did to the democratically elected president of Iran in the 1950s. British Petroleum did not like the fact that the Iranians were going to keep their oil and sell it to benefit their own people.
6619 2018-07-23 12:05:20 Fyi, olive oil yg dijual di pasaran banyak yg fake est, gak 100% olive oil. Kalau mau buat numis2 mending pake canolla atau grape oil

6624 2018-07-23 12:04:53 Hahaha alright Russian oil f.c!!! Sarcasm at its best 
6625 2018-07-23 12:04:34 Memory Monday: 

Trump: "We should have taken the oil. Who knows, maybe we'll get another chance."
6626 2018-07-23 12:04:34 Iran cuts off the oil and $15 bucks a gallon is back. Line ups at the pumps. Great fun.
6627 2018-07-23 12:04:32 Tried to drop my @Ford Edge off for a scheduled appt 4 an oil leak. However the ext warranty we purchased 4 2500 is good only in Cinc Ohio?? WTH We live in NC that would’ve been nice to know #shaddy
6628 2018-07-23 12:04:25 Iran doesn’t have a nuke but they can stop the oil and gas traffic in the gulf, which will hurt the US economy by billions if not trillions

6631 2018-07-23 12:04:08 In a real world we do not need Iran oil. Do you all remember in the past?
We can use our own resources here, but looking at the market this morning, the greed has taken over and our prices will go up with the new Iran chapter of boulder dash !
6632 2018-07-23 12:04:02 The only thing that saved England was the discovery of oil in the Scottish North Sea, it alone paid for all the infrastructure spend in and around London, The M25 was built using Scotlands money, along with a few wealthy families making fortunes at our expense.
6633 2018-07-23 12:03:53 @Gamious I think i speak for a lot of people when i say that you should add a private multiplayer to "Turmoil". The game seems like it's designed around it, but it isn't an option. Love the game though<3. I'd love to show of my oil powers against my friends. please respond.
6634 2018-07-23 12:03:53 #QandA You MUST control the OIL industry...oil=plastic
6635 2018-07-23 12:03:51 It was Salmond, and that was 5 years ago.  Salmond had many qualities but he had an unfortunate addiction to bombast. Oil prices fluctuate, which is why Norway invested their wealth reap the benefits while we pissed ours away on tax cuts that caused a recession. WM for you.
6636 2018-07-23 12:03:50 Did she mention the reduced snowfall and loss of snowpack caused by the impact of oil and gas methane emissions, too?
6637 2018-07-23 12:03:50 Crude oil price is down! However, we don’t see the impact on our Petrol Pumps

6640 2018-07-23 12:03:09 If you are staying that we need to continue burning oil so that it doesn't pollute, then that is incorrect and not fact based.

6655 2018-07-23 12:00:57 This is nothing but an economic trade War as Iran and Russia have been supplying oil to Europe. The United States wants to create a pipeline going from Qatar through Syria and ending in Turkey to supply European oil. It's one big billionaires game and we are all the Pawns.

6706 2018-07-23 11:54:36 Oil is a very volatile commodity for a multitude of international reasons. There’s a lot more to gas prices than the American economy.
6707 2018-07-23 11:54:33 I think you’re thinking too big. The US has now found more domestic oil and gas than Iran could ever dream of. He’s opening land and destroying the EPA to allow expansion. He’s simply ingratiating himself to Putin to be able to expand the Trump name in Russia. It’s all about him.

6711 2018-07-23 11:54:01 Nobody ever said they can, but they can DISRUPT.

All they need to do is disrupt, and see oil prices go through the roof.

Oil tanker captains are not military men, they won't risk going into a zone where any navy is in full kinetic mode.
6712 2018-07-23 11:53:47 TO CLARIFY:
The Oligarchy that "RUNS" the USA
wants to change the regime/go to war with Iran
so as to have another Mid East puppet

6720 2018-07-23 11:52:23 Retweeted WorldOnAlert (@worldonalert):

#US government plans to reduce #Iran's oil export to 0% until 4th November 2018. #US will start a TV and radio station for #Iran|ian people and announced "to support all Iranians who want to topple the #Iran|ian regime".
6721 2018-07-23 11:52:12 Maybe Iran was the deal they struck in Helsinki. The US forces are used to smash it then they leave the mess for Putin to clear up. He cuts Asia in half and trump and he gorge themselves on the oil riches. Brezhnev tried it before in Afghanistan & failed.
6722 2018-07-23 11:52:05 The plot against Iran has been in place since day one oligarchs control of the price of oil depends on controlling Iran

6759 2018-07-23 11:46:47 During the tanker war, Saddam wanted US to intervene so he attacked Iranian oil tankers, he expected Iran to completely seal of the strait in retaliation but Iran targeted Iraqi tankers only. It was the smart thing to do then* but they successfully blocked Iraqi tankers no?

6860 2018-07-23 11:32:22 Half of the countries in the world are corrupt, but have no oil or nukes. Big deal. Meanwhile, $2M of our money is spent each time Trump golfs, when there is a perfectly good course at Camp David. Then there’s Helsinki...#corrupt AND #treasonous. Shut up Mike.

6863 2018-07-23 11:31:57 "While the major oil & gas companies publicly support the Paris Agreement... they also belong to trade associations that proactively lobby against climate action. InfluenceMap has shown that Shell, BP, Total, ExxonMobil & Chevron are all members of such trade associations"

6865 2018-07-23 11:31:38 The name of the game is Gas & Oil. Trump is eager to get it under US control.
6866 2018-07-23 11:31:27 And in the meantime, will boost the price of oil for Putin.
6867 2018-07-23 11:31:21 Exactly!  Obama and his secret police are the ones who destroyed the credibility of FISA, Comey's FBI, Brennan's CIA & Rice's NSC.  The Obama crowd acted like Saddam when he lost Kuwait.   Libs set fire to every oil well they could before losing power!

6870 2018-07-23 11:31:18 I lived in Edmonton for a summer. Fort Edmonton Park could be half day trip. I enjoyed touring south around Nisku (check out Richie Bros site) & east to Fort Saskatchewan. Lots of oil industry action!
6871 2018-07-23 11:30:56 AMI corporation killed HD by allowing poor quality and flaws while pricing as premium bikes. Failures and leaking oil was more likely the cause. Once AMI was gone, the company built better machines.
6872 2018-07-23 11:30:54 Quick reminder that 1/3rd of the world’s sea-moved oil passes through the Iranian-controlled Strait of Hormuz, which the Revolutionary Guard could mine and close. Can you imagine what would happen to global oil prices?

6879 2018-07-23 11:30:12 Bathroom smelled wonderful this morning, just like my favourite expensive shower oil.... having a teenage girl means that the house always smells of lovely beauty products, but it costs a fortune because it always seems to be MY expensive beauty products that get used!
6880 2018-07-23 11:30:03 War would be foolish. To say the least.  Iran and Iraq both  know the oil the United States produces surpasses the amount one of those Countries exports to the U.S. Which is stupid bcuz we export our oil to other Countries.  One must look at the leverage Iran has...
6881 2018-07-23 11:30:02 True but the refineries which are the source of oil for the OFDs also would not be getting any crude in event of blockade. UK is supposed to keep 90 days supply of crude in storage and oil could be delivered by road/rail in extremis
6882 2018-07-23 11:29:48 No, Putin has ordered Trump to start a war with the Iranians - he wants them weakened. Increases the value of his oil & gas exports, cripples a rival to his Middle East intevention. Trump does EVERYTHING Putin wants.

6884 2018-07-23 11:29:26 Are you suggesting that if Germany gets cut off from the oil they will boost their military.  You first ALL CAP TWEET as about Germany having to boost their military, right?
6885 2018-07-23 11:29:07 Wikipedia says 80% of Iran's export is Oil. I'll just leave this info here. curious 
6886 2018-07-23 11:29:00 I’ll be topping our oil tank up in February too.
6887 2018-07-23 11:28:29 In desperation for re election the incorruptible man of integrity is offering oil wells to influential individuals like Senate President 

Well done @MBuhari
6888 2018-07-23 11:28:29 I reckon I know what the secret deal Trump made with Putin. He promised to start WW3, Putin gets the oil and gas, Trump gets the arm sales and the day-glow hotels..
6889 2018-07-23 11:28:21 Straits of Hormuz are only 54 miles wide. They aren't that difficult to mine.

Once you mine them, you disrupt the flow of oil tankers for weeks or months it would take to de-mine them. Chaos ensues.

Iran's mullahs are rational, unlike ISIS, so they are unlikely to try it
6890 2018-07-23 11:27:55 sir turn off the oil going to the usa    stop it have all ship going to the usa with oil turn back
do not let trump push you around
6891 2018-07-23 11:27:46 Jamaica is so small with steady fx inflows... No manufacturing. The only real reason they cant manipulate a strong currency is debt. The could curb oil buying with wind/solar and then work something out for medicine.

6900 2018-07-23 11:26:28 You're overlooking the straight of Hormuz. They can easily make it unnavigable with naval mines if desired. No oil sales for them = no oil for anyone else.

6902 2018-07-23 11:26:21 LOL!!! Tyranny? The middle east holds no tyranny over us.  All our issues with that region stem from trying to control it so we can get the oil. Their tyranny is they want us to GTFO their countries and stop propping up madmen and despots who promise to cut us sweet oil deals.

6904 2018-07-23 11:26:20 I do believe we had loans from the IMF. We were bankrupt. We were saved by North Sea oil and rather than having a sovereign wealth fund we sold all of our national assets in a raft of privatisations which made the rich richer!  I obviously have a memory rather “than a pair”
6905 2018-07-23 11:26:16 Unless a US strike destroys Iran’s retaliatory capabilities 100%, Saudi oil & desal plants will be attacked. 
Also, if Hezbollah is not crippled simultaneously, Israel & Lebanon will suffer greatly.  
Cheaper option: Remove Asad to break-up Shia Crescent, strangle HA/Iran.

6912 2018-07-23 11:25:32 Why people like Trump and JRM are able to peddle their snake oil. The bottomless yearning of some voters to live in the world as it was, not as it is.

6915 2018-07-23 11:24:50 It's almost as like the Democrats you got the Iranians to give up their small defensive nuclear Arsenal, so that the Republicans could come in, destroy Iran as we did to Iraq and steal their massive oil resources. And how dare Iraq not price there oil in American dollars?

6919 2018-07-23 11:23:59 USIC and FBI caught Kremlin interfering. Denials by criminals are nothing new. Trump & Kremlin have a huge oil deal that cannot go forth with sanctions in place. Russian economy will tank without this deal - the real reason they are helping Trump & GOP.

6961 2018-07-23 11:17:53 Looks like Commander-in-Capslock was asked by his Moscow boss to hike oil price to help Russian budget. Of course the hard base will blame Crook'd Hillary at the gas pump.
6962 2018-07-23 11:17:48 It's probably aimed at his base and Putin so they can see how "tough" he is.  He's following orders to raise the price of Russian oil because Russia is nearly broke.

6964 2018-07-23 11:17:34 Just the character assassination on the part of Pompeo. Iran has the highest reserves of oil in the world now that Saudis are in decline. They West wants them and Iran knows it. So Iran lets them know it will come at a heavy cost.

There we have it folks. It's about oil!!
7106 2018-07-23 10:58:50 It's because the US calls them an ally and calls Russia an enemy. Saudi Arabia sells the US oil and fights proxy wars in the region against nations the Russians call allies like Iran.

Buhari and the APC beg suspected OFFA robbery gang leader to remain in the Party. Offer him oil wells. 
7124 2018-07-23 10:57:14 Egypt has a 100million + population,zero rainfall,only one river and no oil yet it’s self sustaining food-wise exporting surplus...it’s also in Africa. Let’s stop excusing mediocrity.
7125 2018-07-23 10:57:05 Why? What about palm oil? Palm oil derivatives are in every commercial moisturiser and cleanser. What about glycerine? Glycerine is added to sorbolene, it is a byproduct of saponification of plant and animal oils (usually palm oil).
7126 2018-07-23 10:56:35 Russian oligarchs need oil prices to go up. Middle East unrest does this. 45's main purpose was to drive up oil! Oligarchs expect huge returns on their oil investments made with illegal loans that are due soon.
7127 2018-07-23 10:56:19 It is all about transporting and selling Russian oil.

7132 2018-07-23 10:54:57 Oil price increase is not because of train law. Its because of the high price in international market.

7136 2018-07-23 10:54:13 First , Trump’s rhetoric could cause disruption of oil, much higher gas prices and disruption on the global market which won’t benefit anyone.

7138 2018-07-23 10:53:27 Thank you. I assumed you were aware bc you knew about palm oil. Most people on Twitter are lurkers (I started out that way too in 2009!) and they love to read comments by others. This was my way of explaining the general diff between vegans and vegetarians to them. #BanPalmOil
7139 2018-07-23 10:53:25 Russia oligarchs aren't happy that oil prices haven't risen higher. They invested in oil with illegal loans that are about to be called. Middle East unrest drives up oil.

The place where I see the most doubt in the next 2-3 months are with the short UST's because inflation might be topping off :/

7145 2018-07-23 10:52:32 Iran has the United Stares over a barrel (Of Oil) because if we impose sanctions and Iran retaliate by closing the Straits of Hormuz oil will go to $250 + a barrel .
7146 2018-07-23 10:52:21 Erm... exactly when & where did Iran threaten you? I know Iran's presence threatens your Russian masters' oil, that's a thing; there's also the fact that a stable Iran stabilises the Middle East and scuppers Russia's machinations. But you're too inconsequential to threaten!

Good OIL report this morning... thank you!... have a Blessed Day
7164 2018-07-23 10:49:51 All these lovers of Big Oil  can afford to live in cool air conditioned buildings - if they lived in hot houses without air conditioning I wonder would they be so keen on fossil fuels  and so hostile to acting on climate
7165 2018-07-23 10:49:50 Instead of choosing renewable, sustainable energy, Scott Tipton @RepTipton wants to expand harmful oil and gas exploration with it's finite resources. Not a good thing for anyone except, maybe, those that will gain short-term profits.

7167 2018-07-23 10:49:17 God doesnt care about your burnt sacrifices. God doesn't want your rivers of anointing oil.

7171 2018-07-23 10:48:49 Well you need to know how to read the graph to make decision. You need to understand the numbers, such as the volume P/E ratio etc... to make wise decision
7172 2018-07-23 10:48:46 Islam is being used by deep state to create damage and division mostly in Europe. They are meant to bankrupt Europe while the global elite steal their oil and gas and their kids. Where are their kids?
7173 2018-07-23 10:48:36 Such nonsense!  By extension, any who drive a non electric vehicle, fly in an aircraft, use plastics or any oil derived product, use gas for cooking or heating, we all rely on fossil fuels in any and every way.

Journalists have to call these litigation nutters out.

7176 2018-07-23 10:48:27 So first you claimed that Iraq did have WMD’s, easily debunked. Then you argued that even if they didn’t we still made the right choice because just in case. Now you’re conceding that the war was wrong but somehow I’m our interests (Oil?)? Talk about pivoting.
7177 2018-07-23 10:48:22 It would lead to the Norwegian model. They are still negotiating and will eventually join as their oil and gas run out and other forms of energy are introduced. #EEA

I always make sure to read the ingredients. Palm oil a major no-no.

7266 2018-07-23 10:37:44 Thanks ( : Im still less optimistic than I was about H2 for consumption but good news on oil supply so that's something I guess. Really liked the summer fc btw

7268 2018-07-23 10:37:40 Translation; thanks to #BrexitShambles our only hope is to hang on to the oil.
7269 2018-07-23 10:37:34 Oil will be worth 150 dollars a barrel " my bonnet and me"  before the independence referendum 
7270 2018-07-23 10:37:29 whats that weed oil?

7272 2018-07-23 10:37:27 Here's an idea: let's stop using Middle East oil!
7273 2018-07-23 10:37:22 @SaberVivirTVE palm oil has no effect the way you prescribed it. I don't like that please. It has good effect on us Africa please because of our nature. I have proves please.
7274 2018-07-23 10:37:19 The oil industry is picking up.
7275 2018-07-23 10:37:17 Nollywood (the Nigerian movie industry) is Nigeria's second biggest export,after crude oil.
7276 2018-07-23 10:37:15 Irony of advertising by famous personalities 
Purchase gold from Kalyan jeweler 
Take loan on gold from Muthoot finance   
And when you can’t pay loan then use Navratna oil 
@SrBachchan
7277 2018-07-23 10:37:11 This argument is almost similar to saying that the oil producing zones gain nothing by having oil because it goes to the federal govt. Even when OBJ withheld local govt funds, Lagos survived largely due to the port. It is what it is.
7278 2018-07-23 10:37:04 I predict Cheeto will attack Iran because they want the oil.
7279 2018-07-23 10:36:58 All organic matter dies 24/7 & this produces oil which will begin to bubble up to the surface & ocean floor polluting ground water, the oceans etc. This is much more complicated than most think. We all want a clean earth...though every action has a reaction.
7280 2018-07-23 10:36:43 Ang gaganda tsaka fresh namin nila bradd papunta. Nag oil control sheet pa kami.
7281 2018-07-23 10:36:40 have you tried bio oil?? iconically lovely and non pore clogging so you can literally put it all over your face ugh dreamy
7282 2018-07-23 10:36:23 In fairness Dubai is sitting on 4 billion barrells of oil

7299 2018-07-23 10:34:17 however, as Pure is dairy free, butter cannot be used in this instance to make the product. Palm Oil is a nondairy hard oil. It is therefore used as a replacement for butter in Pure Spreads, as well as in many other Dairy Free Spreads. Thanks for contacting us. 2/2

7306 2018-07-23 10:33:38 @SaberVivirTVE please palm oil is not what you people put together .it is not what to be to your nature. Please don't condem what God has given to us in Africa. Promote yours don't condem ours please.

•Masage in your scalp
•Leave on for 30 minutes 
•Rinse it out and shampoo hair

7339 2018-07-23 10:28:45 Wrong. US did export oil and gas under Obama.

But we do have to fight climate change, so prepare for alternative forms of energy. Supporting oil and gas is supporting Russia. Germany does more than US to switch over to other forms of energy.
7340 2018-07-23 10:28:40 Long overdue. They've been burning flags and talking garbage while sabotaging our airline industry for over a decade.

Now they stand in way of Brexit.

7375 2018-07-23 10:24:21 Actually the United States overthrew the modern Democratic elected president in the 1950s and installed the Shah, who was a tyrannical dictator but shared the massive oil profits with UK / USA. The US doesn't give a flying fuck about human rights, it's all about oil and Empire.

7380 2018-07-23 10:23:46 I don't see that happening. Iran is not a manufactured enemy of America. Unlike Russia, Iran actually is a real enemy and so is most of the Middle East. Once we free ourselves of buying their oil to fund terrorism, only then can we truly be free of their tyranny.
7381 2018-07-23 10:23:41 METHOD 2:OLIVE OIL 
Olive oil has lots of nutrients that soften and strenfthen your hair 
•Heat oil to body temp 
•Massage your hair and scalp
•Leave on for 30-45 minutes
•Wash out with shampoo 
You have to do this for weeks to see any diffrence♡
7382 2018-07-23 10:23:39 Can somebody who can cook tell me if there’s a oil to ketchup ratio or if waters the trick 
7383 2018-07-23 10:23:13 Lol or maybe we focus on real threats and not nation building in places like Iraq where we didn't belong anyways. Also we like air superiority and spy crazy as opposed to kids boots on the ground to fight for your oil and construction contracts. Counter Cyber Attacks not war.
7384 2018-07-23 10:22:58 Oil is not. So it’s not about oil anymore, as it hasn’t responded to global events like prior. We’re the biggest producer of oil. We don’t need to rely on foreign oil anymore. There is a new agenda.

7390 2018-07-23 10:21:40 The end of oil? Yes... it's a sad time. Crown Prince MBS of Saudi Arabia has his work cut out. Fortunately, though, and likely due to Western pressures, he is moving away from hard-line Islam and suppression of human rights to a more liberal state. Best wishes.

7409 2018-07-23 10:18:17 Yes, strongman Putin singlehandedly held the oil price high from 2000 to 2014 thus improving the living conditions in Russia.

Never mind he and his croonies stole billions.

And never mind he since 2014 has emptied the coffers and had to raise the pension age.

7414 2018-07-23 10:17:22 Peanut, canola, coconut, corn, soy, walnut, pumpkin, grape, sunflower, safflower, any of the plants widely used to make cooking oil.
7415 2018-07-23 10:17:13 There is a character in the movie ‘The Outlaw Josie Wales’, a snake oil salesman who is Trump personified. I’ve been pissed at Eastwood since his little scenario with the chair, but watched the movie las week.

They captured Trump in all his sleazy, con man glory.

7466 2018-07-23 10:05:34 No, this is #RudyGiuliani's payback for representing Trump.  He is representing MEK, the ex-terrorist group that wants to regain power in Iran.  And Russia wants Iranian oil fields to the North.  This isn't bluster.  It's the lead-up to a Trump-declared war.

7476 2018-07-23 10:03:26 Oh, where you wash your face with oil based cleansers instead of normal soap! The point is that oil attracts oil, so using it will pull more oil & dirt out of your skin.

7482 2018-07-23 10:02:34 Crude is trading at $70 which is considerably higher than the Unionist high glee point of $40.  Hilarious though that Unionists suddenly become strident environmentalists when the oil price goes up.

7484 2018-07-23 10:02:13 @realDonaldTrump In the speech of the US Secretary of State, it was emphasized that Iran's oil exports would reach zero, yes, it would certainly reach zero. It will also not receive any currency that can sponsor terrorism
7485 2018-07-23 10:02:08 Just think if us Colonialist's had found oil how much better life could have been,possibly no need to join Somalia and shared your wealth Somaliland could have been as rich as UAE. Food for thought?

7524 2018-07-23 09:56:51 Thanks to the @liberal_party we are missing out on the oil party. And before someone points out Harper didn't get much done he was dealing with the black (but much smarter) Trudeau of the USA. Obama's legacy is so epic it only took a few months for Trump to destroy it.
7525 2018-07-23 09:56:41 Mayby you should concentrate on developing alternatives to oil so oil price and Powers connected to it would crash and solve these kind of problems for you? ;)
7526 2018-07-23 09:56:27 Iran isn't scared of the USA that's what Trump forgets ,the only reason why the US is after Iran coz it wants to control the Iran oil that's all

Stating that in case Iran is attacked they will defend themselves and will not allow oil transports through THEIR waters is threatening you?

7572 2018-07-23 09:48:35 Because oil is a very expensive game, Brockham and Balcombe have been virtually untouched for 2 years. A lot of work to be done. Ask yourself why it’s been 2 months since Balcombe RNS, and it’s only a 7 day well test.

7589 2018-07-23 09:46:17 I think the “obsession” you speak of is actually called a “reliance”. Similar to oil. I’m sure you’re consuming both right this very second. Of course you are. You’re on the internet
7590 2018-07-23 09:45:54 Also give Trump the oil.
That's all he went on about with concern to Iraq!
He wanted to know why the US didn't take the oil?
This was in his ummmm speech to the CIA on his first day as President.
No wonder they looked surprised, they must have thought, we have an idiot here!!

7595 2018-07-23 09:45:29 Not true! His master told him 2 start a war w Iran, Pompeo's speech, helping both! Rise in oil price & arms sale! Other closest allies, Saudi & Israel, love it, encouraging those communities vote Republican in coming election! Why shld US impeach him?
7596 2018-07-23 09:45:14 It may reach to 120000 Rials, but these political speeches are not the only Factors of our currency’s fluctuations, there are 1000 of Factors and the must important one is being dependent on exporting oil for over 60 years without any alternative

Oil is a fossil fuel that has been formed from a large amount of tiny plants and animals such as algae and zooplankton. NOT DINOSAURS.

7653 2018-07-23 09:37:00  You keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better. Use your head, the tweet was a response to Iranian President tweet. Iran is getting desperate, because China doesn’t want their oil. China won’t buy, because of Trump.

7688 2018-07-23 09:30:58 Most of Gensokyo still doesn't use electricity and it would use oil charcoal and gas for things like simple lamps and stuff, and kotatsu

Also the nuclear thing didn't work out cus she's STILL trying to find ways to power Gensokyo and it's been like 10 years

7706 2018-07-23 09:27:41 Iraq is different as sanctions might kwell any desires for a war,in the end.But only if the EU gives up pricing Iranian oil imports in EUROS and China stops buying their oil for gold
7707 2018-07-23 09:27:38 2/ A TigerSwan advisory board member, CharlesPittman, has direct ties to oil/gas industry. Pittman “served as Pres. of Amoco Egypt Oil Company, Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, and Regional Pres. BP Amoco plc. (covering the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, Egypt, and India)"
7708 2018-07-23 09:27:28 Exactly.. all fried stuff. Like brinjal fry, fish fry ... But I can't stand d smell of mustard oil
7709 2018-07-23 09:27:24 I was planning on using 20lt oil drums for big stuff, think I’ve settled for the 1l oil bottles for nuts and bolts   Like in the picture, the car boys at work use a lot of them (sometimes a dozen a day) so I’ve got a good supply.

7711 2018-07-23 09:27:21 Wise for gov't to put a caveat on a certain type of names that insinuate a national character like Uganda Oil, Uganda Airlines, Uganda Printers & Publishers etc. The law can be amended to give the state veto powers over such names @UgandaMediaCent @rggoobi @DaltonKaweesa
7712 2018-07-23 09:27:12 Oh wow, you have been busy with your Coconut Oil  Glad you enjoy it so much! 
7713 2018-07-23 09:27:05 Oil US$73.1/bbl vs US$73.0/bbl last week
7714 2018-07-23 09:26:09 Threatening war with an oil producing nation is to raise the price of oil, to further enrich Putin and Oil companies at our expense
7715 2018-07-23 09:25:53 Some dishes taste best with mustard oil. Bengali Aloo Bhaja for instance.
7716 2018-07-23 09:25:52 What wasnt about oil ?

7718 2018-07-23 09:25:45 Iran main crime is threatening to choke oil tankers passing the Hormuz Strait.
7719 2018-07-23 09:25:38 .@ClareFoges comment piece in The Times today is a disgraceful apologia for authoritarianism. 
Democratic standards are falling across the West. It is drivel like that piece that oil the wheels.
7720 2018-07-23 09:25:38 Everything needs manufacturing - including the production and transport of petrol and oil to run ICE cars. I'm sure the 20-year lifetime of a vehicle relying on that far outweighs the production of solar panels. My production is done - there is no more polluting.
7721 2018-07-23 09:25:14 Rouhani's message was clear, you can have great peace or great war.  We see who the raving lunatic is.  smh.  Give up your dumb ideas of "take the oil", the American people have no conflict with the people of Iran, our leaders should not either.
7722 2018-07-23 09:25:13 I loveeee tea tree oil, what also worked for me is Witch Hazel; that stuff does wonders!
7723 2018-07-23 09:24:54 Energy independence is coming soon .  After we don't need Iran's oil anymore,  they will be crushed.

7726 2018-07-23 09:24:21 I have seen him on the floor of the Senate making contributions. 
I heard him several times speak about the state of the nation, budget, airports, operation python dance, cost of foreign treatment, education, oil spill  etc. 
If you don't listen to news avidly, why not shut up?
7727 2018-07-23 09:24:13 Cetaphil tuh aku penasaran tp mahal... Btw kalo nivea soft itu brusan aku baca reviewnya katanya ada yg terlalu oily d mukanya, tp aku butuh sebuah oil d muka jd mgkn kapan2 aku akan cari dan coba. Murah bgt lg lol. Tengs ya wkwk

7732 2018-07-23 09:23:37 So was there reall a threat? Or did you have a nightmare and all you know how to do is tweet? (That’s debatable) but really I just think you’re starting shit because you want to “take the oil”

7750 2018-07-23 09:21:15 Prefer these new glasses to the old ones in your profile pic. New ones imply tenderness. Old ones suggest a raffish Soho restauranteur who smells much too strongly of patchouli oil. It's a powerful scent and should only be applied VERY SPARINGLY.

7756 2018-07-23 09:20:19 What’s going on is that whenever war is threatened with an oil producing country like Iran, the price of oil goes up, taking $$ out of our pockets to further enrich Putin & oil companies that back Trump, #ElusiveElise @RepStefanik & #GOPlutocrat party
7757 2018-07-23 09:20:15 aku 4 menit pake coconut oil sambil dipijat baru pake sabun cuci muka dan bilas air hangat lalu air dingin dehh
7758 2018-07-23 09:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

7761 2018-07-23 09:19:25 So in a way, there is some method to the madness. The only thing of course that can prolong this, is Saudi Arabia. They want to keep Iran incapacitated and restricted from exporting oil because it benefits them. Trump won't always listen to them though. Good ties with Qatar.
7762 2018-07-23 09:19:16 kamu mau goreng apa dulu? minyak kelapa atau minyak sayur biasa aja, jgn goreng pake olive oil
7763 2018-07-23 09:19:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
7764 2018-07-23 09:18:34 KEEP OUT OF THEIR BUSINESS.  THEIR OIL IS THEIR OIL NOT YOURS.
7765 2018-07-23 09:18:25 Its really appreciating to reply with in a short period. I salute to Trump No one becomes as no one and must behave like this. Islam countries are only strong due to excess of oil richness and none. same arrogant happens with India.  I salut America salut Trump

7768 2018-07-23 09:18:00 Olive oil. Cmn kalo pertanyaannya itu sih, minyak mungkin bgs yg bener2 baruuu bgt yg msh kuning bersih gt bkn yg udh coklat. Mentega jg bagus sihh
7769 2018-07-23 09:17:42 Then, please show the international community the people can be prosecuted in Nigeria.... your own staff at NNPC are writing false memos to the President and taking over oil blocks from legitimate winners ..only to give it to their friends to manage it!

7778 2018-07-23 09:14:58 Yeah, Russia  (a major oil producer ) would love if you started a conflict there. You know China and Russia would provide them weapons right? Or are you too much of a tool to realize that? Of course you must do what putin wants huh? U r his bitch... right?

7781 2018-07-23 09:14:37 Yes. That’s correct. 
But I think there are allegiances  - maybe to do with oil, but also what is seeming to be a fascist alliance to create chaos; annihilate rule of law. 
I know it sounds illogical but the actions / allegiances describe something we’re not seeing clearly. Yet.

Figures oil boys would do it again w/Trump.
Tons of $$ oil co's will make from inflated, speculated oil prices from just 1 tweet suggesting possible conflict

7811 2018-07-23 09:07:43 No, Mr. Iran guy, Donald Trump won. Yeah, the reality TV show guy. Not Hillary.

The slug throws salt at the snail, killing him, as he's a radicalist that hates big oil.

7825 2018-07-23 09:04:15 Apart for being bad for your health, companies who use the oil ( cheap ) support cruelty and contribute to health problems of the people who purchase their products. If ingredients on products say vegetable oil it is highly likely canola oil.Need to do your research if you care.

7833 2018-07-23 09:03:05 Disgraceful misleading headline by the independent. Profits are not down because of fears of a no deal Brexit. They are down due to rise in wage costs and rise in oil prices. Y are u purposefully lying to the public? Oh Yeah, cause you’re anti Brexit and are playing project fear

7955 2018-07-23 08:38:39 Use baby oil to remove your tan!! I swear it works wonders, I use it all the time to stop myself looking like tiger bread
7956 2018-07-23 08:38:35 Definitely should be self-sufficient, but how? What about resources that we can't get here? High time to start making sure US is energy secure, outside of just oil, for the next century. How do you think we go about this?

7963 2018-07-23 08:36:56 Hmm! You’re correct that oil money sustained the country thru thisrcyears but if you learned that at Uni it would be from a left wing perspective. Thatcher didn’t have a ‘project’ to destroy jobs,- think about it! Why would she? They provided tax revenues. But they were grossly..
7964 2018-07-23 08:36:54 .@dwilliam9940 Agreed, the issue for the US now is who gets all that oil they no longer need.
7965 2018-07-23 08:36:27 He said it on the campaign trail: oil he thought US should take their oil. He’s all about his own pocket $$$$$
7966 2018-07-23 08:36:27 Hey but it'll force up the price of oil but who could possibly want that I wonder

7978 2018-07-23 08:34:05 Currently Iran threatens to close the straight of Hormuz which affects 20% of all oil exports worldwide. The Iranian people don’t have water or electricity due to the regime who then kill them when they protest. Look at Pompeos latest tweets. Iran is a major problem

8037 2018-07-23 08:19:39 What I’d recommend for those is a natural scrub . I got super lazy so once in a while I put some olive oil +sprinkles of baking soda + 2 or 3 drops of lemon oil on a cotton pad & just use that around your face cos the exfoliating thing (Garnier product) stopped working for me
8038 2018-07-23 08:19:26 America disrupted their budding constitution democracy to favor British oil interest, then imposed and supported a brutal autocrat for a while.

8094 2018-07-23 08:08:23 They’ll mine the hell out of the Straight of Hormuz and stop the flow of crude oil from the Persian Gulf. Also remember, the U.S. has not won a single war since WW II. Campaigns in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan were all failures. Be cautious!

8102 2018-07-23 08:07:06 Oil and over $1 trillion worth of minerals. Iran sits at the strategic intersection of the East and West and has warm water ports.
8103 2018-07-23 08:06:59 Iran has one of the largest oil reserves in the world, yet can’t provide water or electricity to its people while it can afford to send over $10 billion to terrorist organisations. When its people protest in the streets for water they are gunned down by the IRGC

8108 2018-07-23 08:06:23 I think you being in the US has made you believe oil is the only thing of value. Fresh water is the most valuable resource for humans to survive and cutting off supply to millions of English would have a devastating impact on their nation

8120 2018-07-23 08:03:43 Because some of you in the SE don't have respect for your own leaders (that's if you even have any that you identify with), you now want to use one foolish and needless thread to pour palm oil on Asiwaju and expect "us" to clap for you. You must be sick upstairs.

8129 2018-07-23 08:01:18 Yes, deep water, oil from shale all have lower energy returns than the 10 times of early conventional, but we need probably >15 units of dispatchable energy for every unit invested to run modern society

8131 2018-07-23 08:01:10 It's what happens when the global trade currency is based on oil & the oil market price is manipulated #OOTT
8132 2018-07-23 08:00:53 Hold on, if the oil price climbs, surely that will just put more pressure on to jettison fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy, in which case, Putin is shooting himself in the foot. Or am I missing something here?

the question is what does putin want?

he wants to rebuild russia, and his alliances with trump, bibi, erdogan, kju, xi, salman & others are indicative of where he wants to invade.

again, what does he want?

ports, pipelines, oil, power & glory.

8214 2018-07-23 07:47:04 An incoherence that precedes Trump though. And this incoherence has its coherence: oil. A vast swathe of contemporary global problems can be traced back to the green light Iraq thought it had from the US to invade Kuwait, and to the 1990 war that followed that invasion.

He awarded 3 oil blocks to Deji & promised to make Kwakwanso the next Dangote before the end of 2019.

8237 2018-07-23 07:42:41 Put beard oil in last night like the Sophisticated Modern Man I am and it’s all over my face now which is a nice touch. Really adds to the sweat imo.
8238 2018-07-23 07:42:09 Salt and olive oil, yes

Cheese. Yeah, but I'm using it for mozzarella sticks later.

No potatoes.

8245 2018-07-23 07:41:19 I know how much you hate OPEC and this solidified it. No one threatens our country, not even money-hungry oil barons. We need to stop being dependent on Middle-Eastern oil because it funds terrorism.

8247 2018-07-23 07:40:22 I’m so confused as to why the walk to work is full of oil. It’s literally like it rained oil last night 
8248 2018-07-23 07:40:20 Oil Prices fell amid increasing concerns about fuel demand after finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 warned that global economic growth risks have increased amid rising trade and geopolitical tensions.
8249 2018-07-23 07:40:16 Russia court Iran pre Helsinki but have gas/oil pipeline agendas. You talk tough on Iran sanctions and promote US oil business  but no Iran details after summit. Now Iran bite back at US and you’re acting like a crazed toddler with a toy gun! Trouble is not a toy! Compete much?

8342 2018-07-23 07:17:56 O stupid of all the American heads of the Reagan era, avoid the war with Iran because its consequences are the burning of the region and the American bases and the cutting off of the flow of oil from the Gulf and its high prices.

Investment in coal was lower but offset by increased spending on oil and gas.

8359 2018-07-23 07:14:09 Sir, with due respect String of pearls strategy have worked out, all Indian neighborhood are in now China camp, Russia left India and joined CPEC, Iran blamed India recently for oil imports after US pressure and Raveesh Kumar said Chahbhar port is now in jeopardy, US rejected 2+2

8363 2018-07-23 07:13:33 All you armchair warriors should take a seat. Threatening #Rouhani & the #Iranian people is no joke. Don't mistake #Iran for Iraq. eg. War-gaming a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz would see oil rise to $300-$400+ a barrel.
Republicans better come to grips w/doing the right thing
8364 2018-07-23 07:13:30 The British infrastructure arm of Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund has agreed to buy oil and gas pipeline firm North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP) for around 1.3 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) from ArcLight Capital, according to two sources.
8365 2018-07-23 07:13:27 The question is how many steps are we away from buying Russian oil?

8373 2018-07-23 07:12:19 I never took a war with N. Korea that serious mainly because there is nothing N. Korea has that US Corporations want or need.

However

War with the Middle East is a huge possibility for Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia does have something US Corporations want and need.

8391 2018-07-23 07:09:41 Iranian statement was logical, there will be a great peace or a great war. US pressure on Iranian trading partners to stop importing Iranian oil will lead to war.
8392 2018-07-23 07:09:36 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
8393 2018-07-23 07:09:23 No need to be scared. Turkey & China and others have agreed to buy oil from Saudi's. Iran's economy will collapse. The ppl of Iran will overthrow the Mullah's. President is sending them a signal we  stand with them.

Not per sé to control it, but because Iran doen't fit /doesn't want to fit in his scheme of a global energy monopoly.
8405 2018-07-23 07:07:05 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.

8441 2018-07-23 07:00:24 The things he's doing ensures that very little will continue to be made in America. 2 days ago, Alabama and Tennessee announced very real difficulties due to tariffs. Companies are moving overseas. Dollar rises, so do costs re: fuel, oil

8458 2018-07-23 06:56:44 Has the 'one belt' for oil reached Iran yet? When that happens, Iran closing the straits of Hormuz becomes a deadly weapon against the Saudis.

8492 2018-07-23 06:50:13 @sliimeshade, there is Sudan and there is South Sudan. South Sudan got her independence from Sudan in 2011 after about 30 years of civil war over oil. Please go and read about it.
8493 2018-07-23 06:50:03 It was Israel that wanted Trump as President. Israel stole Syria oil inside Golan heights. Iran has nothing to loose. Sanction of oil is an Act of War. Iran is not North Korea or Syria.
War would be good for Iran's economy. Trump would be Impeached if he started war.

8510 2018-07-23 06:46:40 Challenges persist: External imbalance is likely to persist in the upcoming fiscal year where we estimate deficit to remain elevated at 5.4% of GDP. Despite incorporating hefty growth in exports (10.6%YoY in FY19F), imbalance is due to higher oil import bill (+20.0%YoY in FY19F)

8516 2018-07-23 06:44:20 Meh...none of those things can make them the money they make on oil.

The oil biz is literally a business of digging up buried treasure. Renewable energy is hard work of innovation, engineering, and slim margins. They can't do it.

Because this is in our national interest, and will help to neuter their evil leadership’s power. So Trump gave it back to him. We’re no longer cowering.

If you have been following this matter, which obviously you have not been, Trump is basically looking to totally stop Iran from exporting its oil in order to destroy its' economy. Iran is complying-no need for this.

8633 2018-07-23 06:25:49 I remember a bumper sticker in the 80's of Mickey Mouse flipping the bird and the words f... iran on the bottom. I don't support any bank with middle eastern ties. Not an expert but lived through all of this. I don't trust them. Never will. 9/11. Boston Marathon.Many videos '80's
8634 2018-07-23 06:25:42 2/2 Learn History to understand, US(CIA) & UK interfered in Iran’s elections in the ‘50s changing their new democracy & reinstalling the Shah, who ruled like S. Hussein. All for oil. If we’re civilized, if we’re moral, we need to prize PEOPLE over oil, over money. Diplomacy!
8635 2018-07-23 06:25:40 Smiling inside this morning. Had several ‘able’ moments during sleepless night. Got the oil paints out...oh how I’ve missed them...Began the background for one of the collages of driftwood. The smell of oil paint is lingering. Contentment & probably a snooze.

8639 2018-07-23 06:24:55 Damn it, Iran ! Don't you understand that oil is the only thing that is backing America's fiat paper ? I don't know what kind of threats that you must be receiving off the radar, but, I know that we are all going to have to defend ourselves against oil tycoons/tyrants and nuc'es.

8641 2018-07-23 06:24:40 Aussie shares easily wiped out last week's gains on Monday. #ASX 200 -0.93% or -58.3pts to 6227.6. Energy stocks edged higher on a lift in oil prices. All other sectors in red. No major economic data. US$0.7422 #ausbiz
8642 2018-07-23 06:24:37 Which means folks that a price for a barrel of oil is going up. Say hello to spending that "huge" tax cut on filling up you tank

8644 2018-07-23 06:24:06 USA wants Iran's land, oil, and natural resources.
USA is the bully of the world. And like most bullies, has little intelligence.
It's the MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX looking to make more wars, to sell more weapons. They run the country, not elected officials.

8646 2018-07-23 06:23:36 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
8647 2018-07-23 06:23:35 coconut oil! it helps nourish the scalp and faster growth and thickness

i recommend the organic coconut oil. it’s about $5-$10 at walmart depending the size!
8648 2018-07-23 06:23:32 (3) Take three spoons of organic or virgin coconut oil early morning and in the night to keep cancer at bay.

Make one of these choices, but be sure to avoid sugar.

8649 2018-07-23 06:23:11 The rod in your hand remains a mere rod until you throw it down.
A jar of oil remains so until you start to pour it out.
A handful of flour in a jar plus small olive oil remain so until you bake it.
No matter how small it is, make use of what's in your hand/house. It'd multiply!

8669 2018-07-23 06:19:46 Very surprised that China is allowing oil to go.
8670 2018-07-23 06:19:39 This proofs that Trump-Putin meeting went well and also the fact that China just inked new oil contract with UAE replacing Iran!

Then Iran answered they wouldnt take it

Then Trumpie lost all his marbles & shouts not to threathen him & they can expect a war

8697 2018-07-23 06:14:32 So the Don knows how to enlarge CAPS to demonstrate shouting. I thought the Iranians were suggesting we stop interfering with their shipping oil or they would interfere with the Saudis oil shipments. The petro-dollar is scarry stuff to the US . . .
8698 2018-07-23 06:14:22 Why? We destroyed the Middle East so that we could get oil, that’s why we fought a war in the 2000s, I personally don’t want to forget that or have that stupid waste of millions of lives be repeated.

Turkey tries to get the oil/gas resources of Cyprus. We must do something on that.

8766 2018-07-23 05:58:50 I hate them so much. Whenever I see one in my room I have to clean & dust every crevice and spray peppermint oil everywhere. There were so many spiders in my room a few months ago & I didn’t know just because I was so messy, those days are over !!
8767 2018-07-23 05:58:48 It's always an excuse to fight in the Middle East. Iran oil, economy, excuse for exploitation

8771 2018-07-23 05:58:15 You want to know what is strange? In 2008 the price of oil was $140 a barrel at R12 to the dollar yet fuel price was R8 for a liter of fuel yet today it is $70 a barrel at R12 to the dollar and we are paying R16 for a liter. Oil is cheaper now but we paying double.

8814 2018-07-23 05:49:35 Cynical view: 

Higher/highest oil prices (sustained for a while) - can make KSA *and Russia happy. - so Russia giving nukes to Iran, US doing so to Gulf (good business for US/Russia)

will make sense. 

And Russia will be able to purchase additional Western politicians/elites?

8847 2018-07-23 05:41:52 Oil prices already rising and why would Trump want to do that? It hurts his own base. Deflect from Russian narrative and Mueller far more likely. Or he’s just batsh*t crazy.

8863 2018-07-23 05:38:23 Get ready for higher oil prices. Trump just saved Russia and Iran economy by that little tweet.
8864 2018-07-23 05:38:14 Hell, I thought oil prices were already high, or is just the gas prices, meaning Big Oil is REALLY shafting us?  Premium Unleaded is $3.55 in NW IA.  The most I EVER paid was $4.10 a gallon back when W was in office! Thank GOD a tank of gas lasts me a month (or more).
8865 2018-07-23 05:37:47 And then theres the issue of oil....gas prices would skyrocket!!  But I guess that's the plan for all your rich CEO buddies, eh?...

8868 2018-07-23 05:37:23 No one has been harder on Russia than Trump. We killed Russians in Syria, the sanctions are higher. He told Germany not to buy oil from Russia. He clarified is would/wouldnt.

iran is different.

it’s strategic.

putin wants iran for oil, pipelines & ports.

he actually wants to invade iran.

putin has worked for this for a long time now. he’s made alliances.

If you don’t shower daily, you may develop chest acne easily. 

Regular showers help remove elements( bacteria,dead skin cells,dirt,oil) that block your pores. 

Use lukewarm water for best results. Consider final rinse in cold water to close pores.

8899 2018-07-23 05:31:38 An attack on Iran has far more potential to beget WWIII than an attack on North Korea. NK can’t explode the entire Middle East AND disrupt world oil markets. Nor draw Israel into the mix.

8908 2018-07-23 05:30:24 Oil does not concern me, after all the US is finally becoming more efficient at drilling/fracking for our own oil. What worries me are things like uranium, cobalt, copper, etc that are mainly situated in places like Africa where China is encoraching the most. See what I mean?

8919 2018-07-23 05:28:56 Yes and if he threatens war against Iran or  attacks them the price of a barrel of oil will go up and that helps Putin . Just like the tariffs China imposed on American soybeans helps Russian farmers who are now selling their soybeans to China......Winning

8935 2018-07-23 05:25:26 It’s Trump who is putting a kabbash on the Russian pipeline from Germany and insisting Germany buy their oil from us instead. Trump has been harsher on Russia than any prez since Reagan, so why do you idiots keep saying T is Russia’s puppet?
8936 2018-07-23 05:25:11 @FarahMaalimM has interest in ignorance of others

Land under #OIL and #MINERALS is classified as #Public land under the constitution (62,64).
8937 2018-07-23 05:24:54 Why doesn't he want to be friends with Iran?  They are as bad-ass as NK and Russia.  They are not our ally and they have oil. Sounds like his cup of tea!
8938 2018-07-23 05:24:34 You knew. You made a oil deal with Russia. You knew.
8939 2018-07-23 05:24:25 They would for sure have the numbers with 3 guys having already left. But I feel like half the girls are like oil and water
8940 2018-07-23 05:24:12 Dude, Trump's supporters don't want regime change. They want to kill as many Iranians as they can. They want to make the Iraq War body count look like a nudge. Btw, you're forgetting what preceded 1979. The overthrow of Iranian secular democracy over oil, installing the Shah.
8941 2018-07-23 05:24:07 HEY DONALD! Can you take a breath  read the entire sentence of Rouhani's? It begins: “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace . . ." and THEN a warning. And here you are, strike match to oil, with your ALL CAPS demented tweet & we're all put at risk.
8942 2018-07-23 05:23:11 Sober up and tell putin to deliver his own messages, WE will NOT get into a war just so he ca drive up oil prices because he has backed his economy into a mess trying to keep up with us and China. #FUCKPUTIN

8956 2018-07-23 05:20:30 Putin has literally been in power for so long because of the high oil prices in the 90s and the prosperity brought in by that. It's why conservatives love him so.

Not funny at all.
8978 2018-07-23 05:17:41 Energy-exporting Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia were among the largest Islamic bond issuers last year, but higher oil prices have given them fewer reasons to tap that market for funds.

8982 2018-07-23 05:17:12 But look how long it took and how many American lives and assets went into Vietnam. Iraq was supposed to repay US efforts via a reduction in oil costs, yet even the US military fighting the country continued to pay high costs when others outside got it cheaper.
8983 2018-07-23 05:16:52 This is about us strong arming other countries to stop buying oil from Iran, on top of the massive sanctions we've already unleashed on them.  Yes, that will foment unrest in the country.
8984 2018-07-23 05:16:49 @KapilSibal .how much mustered oil you purchase daily to oil pappu
8985 2018-07-23 05:16:48 The environment won’t be saved by personal lifestyle bullshit. Getting rid of straws, plastic bags, etc isn’t going to stop global warming. We have to ban oil drilling, gas powered cars and put a price on carbon.
8986 2018-07-23 05:16:35 United states wants Iranian oil so bad. Its like a craving.
8987 2018-07-23 05:16:14 The North Sea ones are oil rigs. 

Could be that low domestic consumption in the heatwave means more flaring off of gaseous side-product (from oil refining) because storage capacity is maxxed out.

8994 2018-07-23 05:15:28 High oil prices have always correlated to lots of “toys” being purchased as many always believe “this time it’s different.”  I have told many of these young guys in West Texas to save and don’t waste their money on “stuff.”  Most never listen however.

9035 2018-07-23 05:09:38 US employed same strategy in Brazil to destabilize an elected government in order to keep control on local oil reserves. They don’t care about a country’s people, all they target is to protect their own ecnomic interests.
9036 2018-07-23 05:09:21 Btw the oil and grease on AWohl's face could help power a weapon of mass destruction

9039 2018-07-23 05:09:08 Coconut oil is a real lifesaver when it comes to my hair
9040 2018-07-23 05:08:59 They do have a choice where they get their oil from. Germany shut down all forms of energy production in their own country making it illegal to produce energy. They also chose to use money for other things instead of pay for their commitments. Trump's tweet was about Iran
9041 2018-07-23 05:08:55 "I now challenge you (OBJ) to search your soul, very deeply, and swear to this nation that you never awarded oil blocks in return for sexual gratification. I do not make accusations lightly and I despise snide insinuations. I believe you know me well enough."

Wole Soyinka to OBJ
9042 2018-07-23 05:08:49 Isn't this all over oil if I'm correct?
9043 2018-07-23 05:08:48 What did Putin tell you to do? We know he wants a war to tighten oil supplies, raise prices so he can sell more, then you will claim tight supply so need to remove sanctions. We know what you two planned.
9044 2018-07-23 05:08:40 Pennsylvania deserves better than this. There's lot of really smart dialed in people there. Those that know that the future of the State belongs to the Generations to Come. Not to Condescending Old Men that would have them stoke coal & burn heating oil for the next 100 years.
9045 2018-07-23 05:08:33 I search for a beard oil and shampoo for days, watch videos, order stuff online. Wait for it to come and use it to straighten by super curly beard. As usual disappointed and the cycle continues 
9046 2018-07-23 05:08:22 The Iranian leadership threatened us with the “mother of all wars”. They also threatened to close the gulf of Hormuz to shipping, shutting down oil exports from Gulf states. Trump is warning them not to escalate. Trump isn’t going to get kicked off Twitter 
9047 2018-07-23 05:08:15 That was years ago, that means that the Ortega regime is allowed to kill? Since Nicaragua has nothing to offer to the US like oil, they wouldn’t care about control Nicaragua again, and also, your seem to ignore that the Sandinistas are raping women in the jails
9048 2018-07-23 05:08:05 Even without seeing this segment, the suspicion around Tillerson has always been there! The CEO of Exxon stepping down to be SoS? Russian oil? Pipelines? Receiving Russia’s highest honor? Mmmhmmm. No coincidence at all. 
9049 2018-07-23 05:07:58 I like lemon olive oil cake.  But I see your point.

9059 2018-07-23 05:06:11 Why does the government want to transport the oil without the bill signed into law? This is corruption and the government has chosen a wrong direction not the people of TURKANA.

9064 2018-07-23 05:05:46 YOUR BIG MOUTH AND IGNORANCE POSE THE LARGEST THREAT TO US NATIONAL SECURITY.

You threatened to stop Iran's oil exports. He only responded to that threat saying, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar." A lesson you should learn because you obviously missed it.
9065 2018-07-23 05:05:44 Iran has no nukes and Russia will invade from the North and permanently occupy their oil fields.
9066 2018-07-23 05:05:31 Makes one wonder about fires in many places . Fort McMurray, Alberta comes to mind , oil capital of Canada . Industrial sabotage is a form of terrorism.
9067 2018-07-23 05:05:26 Hopefully not too raise oil prices. They've been going up just fine on their own.

9082 2018-07-23 05:02:14 The chart was from The Commonwealth Fund, founded in 1918 w/ a $10 million endowment by Anna M. Harkness, widow of Stephen V. Harkness, a principal investor in Standard Oil. Socialists want the benefits ($$) of capitalists they hate. Bunch of hypocrites & users.
9083 2018-07-23 05:02:14 Before I go to bed if I notice any break outs or some trying to come up I spot treat them with tea tree oil.

9101 2018-07-23 04:59:21 Such information is needed since there is reservation policy in each sector. Reservations in oil dealerships are based on caste, faith (minority-majority), geographical area, gender, occupation, and a plethora of other criterion.
9102 2018-07-23 04:59:17 #amliventv this idea that since the oil belongs  to the nation, we cannot say that and ignore the plight of turana this is where we go wrong the first priority should be the community then the nation for the sake of peace

9107 2018-07-23 04:58:55 Trump's deterrent threat to Iran was in response to Rohani. Rohani yesterday threatened to shut down oil shipments in strait of Hormuz, warned US not to play with the lions tail or US will regret it forever; said war with Iran would be mother of all wars.

9110 2018-07-23 04:58:07 Rouhani " The war with Iran is the mother of wars", "we won't allow anybody to export oil from Hormuz strait." to US :"don't play with lion's tail".
if these are not threatening, what does threatening mean?

Either be a Democrat, a progressive one I hope, or gtf out of this party. WE DO NOT FLIP SEATS "RED" as O-C said OUT LOUD
9114 2018-07-23 04:57:15 Thats not what they said at all lol. They are mad the US is trying to cut off oil imports from them and use our own.

9120 2018-07-23 04:55:08 There must be no oil in it for you over there in Iran, eh, Donny? Putin’s already got you set up with Blackstone/Bayrock out there in Russia, so let’s threaten war by tweet to all others. Sounds legit.

9123 2018-07-23 04:54:58 Probably I m wrong, but whole oil seed complex do not look bullish now. Whatever price appreciation u see in Soy oil in last year is due to impose of heavy import duty on crude raw oil. Also CBOT Soy future is at multi year low now. Also Soyabean is worst hit commodity 1/2
9124 2018-07-23 04:54:48 How was Carter bad at his job?

My thesis is that the baby boomers were age 13-31 in 1977 and were beginning to put maximal stresses on the housing and credit sectors of the economy.

Each annual cohort was 4 million, with immense credit capacity.

Oil shocks didn't help either.
9125 2018-07-23 04:54:38 As a Albertan I am curious as to why Ottawa s looking for a "buyer" for our pipeline that we will be ultimately responsible for. We Albertan's and Canadians will be sweating, building causes filling this line with our oil from under our soil. Should "WE" pay for its use as well?

9149 2018-07-23 04:51:23 He knows they r ticked their people r rebeling, he got a country to get their oil from SA instead of Iran & he pulled out of Iran treaty. He's poking the bear.

This isn't a reality show. You're practicing politics with no skills or military strategy, whatsoever. You're casting threats on social media, and putting everyone in harm's way.

Let someone sane, with experience make the decisions. #25thamendmentnow
9155 2018-07-23 04:50:36 None of which correlates with what you’re saying. (That we have control over where the EU gets their oil from.)
But for the record, I don’t hate that Trump is going after other nato allies to get them to pay their fare share.
9156 2018-07-23 04:50:36 Lavender oil and shea or coco butter seems to be a popular remedy. But also gut healing. That's how you get it to go away for a very long time.
9157 2018-07-23 04:50:34 In response to this: a speech Sunday by Mr. Rouhani, who said that any conflict with Iran would be the “mother of all wars.” Mr. Rouhani had earlier threatened the possible disruption of regional oil shipments if its own exports were blocked by United States sanctions.

9166 2018-07-23 04:49:46 Alhamdulillah ala ni'matihi tatinmul saliheen
9167 2018-07-23 04:49:41 50% of Russia’s government revenue comes from oil.

The price of oil has fallen 10% in the last week.

When Trump threatens war against an oil producing country like Iran, the price of oil naturally goes up.

Connect the dots, people.
9168 2018-07-23 04:49:40 #AmLiveNTV @AMLiveNTV about oil..What measures is the government taking to seal the loophole similar to the TZ minerals saga where the mining companies under-declared the exploits? How has this been addressed so it maximumly benefits Kenya and the community in Turkana @OleItumbi
9169 2018-07-23 04:49:20 Omg yes! My favorite pizza place makes this one- Honey Pie. It has olive oil, chicken, applewood-smoked bacon, butternut squash, jalapeños, brie, orange blossom honey, it’s the best thing EVER!! So u should visit High Point, NC

9173 2018-07-23 04:48:30 @saloni_oil Is the Winners of  Saloni Oil #IPromiseMom Contest  Announced ?
9174 2018-07-23 04:48:19 Research oil prices. Best 2 u. 

9175 2018-07-23 04:48:09 Calm down dude. You started threatening by limiting Iran oil exports.
9176 2018-07-23 04:48:02 One of the fryer lit up while I was changing the oil 
9177 2018-07-23 04:47:39 This storm + essential oil diffuser + fresh our the shower
9178 2018-07-23 04:47:33 Coconut oil
9179 2018-07-23 04:47:24 i’m so tired of my skin being an asshole i’m rlly finna chug some coconut oil as a last resort
9180 2018-07-23 04:47:20 Correct. 
However, we do not control where the EU gets their oil. We would be controlling their economy. 
The US has their own interests as the EU does. Our sanctions would not preclude others from doing business. Only us.
This shouldn’t be a tough concept.
9181 2018-07-23 04:47:17 Si vamos a comparar asi hasta Jefferson Montero tiene más recorrido futbolistico q Aguinaga. Aquí estamos discutiendo sobre la calidad futbolistica innata q tuvieron muchos de los jugadores ecuatorianos, y hasta ahora no hemos visto a nadie con la calidad e inteligencia de Alex
9182 2018-07-23 04:47:04 2/ groups, it was Notley who banned union and corporate campaign contributions. Notley whose environmental panel included bigwigs from the oil sector.

Alberta NDP isn't like the others.
9183 2018-07-23 04:47:01 This has nothing at all to do with Russia. The US is trying to prevent Iran from selling its oil. It has no legal authority to do this & reimposed sanctions are already interfering with the Iranian economy. If he keeps going, the Iranians will close the Strait of Hormuz.
9184 2018-07-23 04:46:55 My baby oil nudes


9185 2018-07-23 04:46:44 Would a person float in a bathtub of coconut oil? #urgent
9186 2018-07-23 04:46:42 No he just want his country to be able to export its oil to those willing to buy it 
The threat was to the other gulf nations, not the US
But none of that matter now since no journalist wilk point it out
9187 2018-07-23 04:46:35 Our #president was just answering your threats; 
You #threatend to block our Oil Exports,

9188 2018-07-23 04:46:35 What in the world is wrong with Trump wanting us to be oil independent and no longer held hostage by OPEC.
9189 2018-07-23 04:46:31 As soon as I go home I am taking a shower and. Putting my funny little oil in my hair
9190 2018-07-23 04:46:30 Ur Paleo and ur ranting about palm oil? It's got tonnes of sat fats, dont u ppl like those? How is it different than highly refined coconut oil? Also, the "bad for your heart" thing sounds like that debunked thing about saturated fats causing heart disease. U sure ur Paleo?
9191 2018-07-23 04:46:30 Catokan kudu bagus sih. Pakek hair oil terus kalo nyatok di bagi2 gitu per layer jadi
9192 2018-07-23 04:46:27 I needa soak my finger nails in some tea tree oil and some warm water . Them Damn nails got my real ones so tender 
9193 2018-07-23 04:46:24 オリラジはいいぞ
9194 2018-07-23 04:46:04 So far stock market futures do not believe our deranged tRump is going to attack Iran. Maybe the tRump Crime Syndicate went long oil futures. Then you have the constipated toilet tweeter " work" and by morning oil futures are that much higher.Infinity of Fraudulent Possibilities.
9195 2018-07-23 04:46:01 Also, nobody's buying their oil.

9198 2018-07-23 04:45:35 Not our oil not our lands wtf is wrong with you
9199 2018-07-23 04:45:34 You know Monique didn’t start soaking her children in oil until cameras started rolling this season. #rhop #bravo #wwhl
9200 2018-07-23 04:45:33 1/ Thanks, but we have pretty much the lowest taxes in the country. Not only that, when they reviewed the oil and gas royalties they decided to keep the rates set by the Conservatives. Alberta NDP are quite centrist. In fact, Notley is like Lougheed was.

As for special interest
9201 2018-07-23 04:45:27 Awww.... Glad your fine Holly and doing well. Hmmm.... as for the screaming woman.... Oh well I guess what they say is True. The Squeaky Wheel get the Oil. XOXOXO Leonard
9202 2018-07-23 04:45:15 Oil exports from Iran are not making Iran rich! In fact, until Obama lifted oil sanctions, Iran was in serious economic pain!
9203 2018-07-23 04:44:58 NO TRUMP IS doing great. AMERICA has had a boot on our neck. TRUMP IS STOPPING it 
UNFAIR TRADE deals, UNFAIR amounts to NATO and UN 
UK buying oil from Russia with our money
It's time to put a stop to the nonsense everyone should pay fair and trade fair
Rand, GET US OUT OF UN
9204 2018-07-23 04:44:51 Jadi tergoda face oil dah

9207 2018-07-23 04:44:16 They told Trump to stop threatening their oil & threatening them... can you blame them? He’s made it pretty clear since day one he wants to use nukes and take someone’s oil... not sure he cares whose

9214 2018-07-23 04:43:04 tRUmp isn’t the boss—he’s putin’s apprentice, & always has been.

putin wants a war w/Iran.
he wants Iran’s oil, ports & pipelines.

putin wants to rebuild russia, & always has.

it’s been his plan all along & destruction of NATO/EU & partnerships w/dictators supported that goal.
9215 2018-07-23 04:43:02 I switch up my face wash all the time, but I’ve been consistently using witch hazel after I wash my face, and a blend of tea tree oil and Tamanu oil before bed! Everything is drug store or on amazon cus I’m super cheap lol
9216 2018-07-23 04:43:00 CAP letter tweet. :D Those bastards, US Zionists and Iranians are playing their games and lifting the price of oil and we as idiots should listen the crap of these bastards, US Zionists and Iranians.

9218 2018-07-23 04:42:44 There’d def be a committed guerilla resistance in the case of invasion, but Iran has a full conventional military, a strategic position, and oil, which Vietnam & Afghanistan didn’t. So the initial resistance would be stronger—Afghan military was non existent & Vietnam was split.
9219 2018-07-23 04:42:36 Dropped oil on my sneakers and I’m just so upset now
9220 2018-07-23 04:42:35 A threat of "The mother of all wars", in response to pulling out of the bogus Iran deal?
PS. Fuck Iran's oil.
9221 2018-07-23 04:42:34 Eco still lays my shit, but lately I’ve been using gorilla snot and Argan oil gel
9222 2018-07-23 04:42:34 That's because of high oil prices.
9223 2018-07-23 04:42:16 TEA TREE OIL
9224 2018-07-23 04:42:10 I can get you a great price....  remember our friendship on Twitter dot com.  Maybe  if I throw in a few free oil changes and tire rotations to close the deal? What if I throw in seat warmers and cup holders?
9225 2018-07-23 04:42:00 My friend got an oil pen and he just ordered some 350 mg cartridges and I’m like you’re just testing your limits and he says back bro we overshot it by a mile. It’s been almost 7 hours
9226 2018-07-23 04:41:53 .... or olive oil production.
9227 2018-07-23 04:41:21 I am worried,the news of the mass production of solar powered cars/rechargeable cars etc. It means Nigeria’s oil will soon not going to be needed by the West.What’s Nigeria’s contingency plan or do we run on autopilot?@SPNigeria @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari @atiku @HouseNGR @ShehuSani

9230 2018-07-23 04:40:58 I keep beard oil in my bag
9231 2018-07-23 04:40:42 With the fact that yesterday China signed oil trade deals with the UAE, I bet you're spot on in that assessment.
9232 2018-07-23 04:40:40 I bought a new vial of (combined) tea tree oil, witch hazel, and vitamin e oil for my face & feet. zero issue on those spots. works great. if any tiny bit gets on my neck, i automatically get itchy/irritated as hell. can someone explain/help

9236 2018-07-23 04:40:19 Said he was ready to invoke war and cut off the strait's of Hormuz from all oil delivery

9239 2018-07-23 04:40:06 Certainly you do not care about Iranians , though this is not the way to assist.  America is probably intends to have more control over iran's oil and gas reserves, in the mean time israei and neibouring countries are probably and wrongly happy about iran's problems ...
9240 2018-07-23 04:39:27 Acnedote face wash, aloe Vera gel & the serum with rosehip oil! But it was my diet that rly helped
9241 2018-07-23 04:39:05 .... castor oil is so thick I literally lay me edges with it at night LMAOOO
9242 2018-07-23 04:39:04 Well also we liked the Shah a lot, found Iranian oil, resources & military power very useful (esp. against the USSR), they are at odds with Israel & Saudi Arabia who are our biggest bffs, and they’ve constantly thwarted attempts at regime change etc.
9243 2018-07-23 04:38:56 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9244 2018-07-23 04:38:30 If you’re out that way head over to Donalda. They’ve got a super cool oil lamp museum.
9245 2018-07-23 04:38:05 A lot of big earnings this week in Tech, Oil, and Defense. Also expecting a volatile week in the markets.
9246 2018-07-23 04:37:34 The US is WRONG
1. P5+1 (the UN Security Council) nuclear agreement with Iran was working
2. US decided to unilaterally pull out of the agreement then tried to bully its way to what it wanted
3. US reinstituted economic sanctions & is trying to block Iran from selling its oil
9247 2018-07-23 04:37:33 calls BS on @realDonaldTrump. War with Iran is out. Saudi oil would go aflame pronto. US Oil interests won’t allow that. World depression.  Israel would burn so fast from thousands on missiles pointed at it. It’s all bravado and distraction.
9248 2018-07-23 04:37:31 Who decided it was good to dip our bread in oil? I hate that! I want butter! What, no choice? Don’t like that either?!
9249 2018-07-23 04:37:24 I FOUND MY OIL PASTELS AND BOX OF OTHER ART SUPPLIES.

9251 2018-07-23 04:36:43 Iran, Syria, Israel ,Turkey, Ukraine, add in Putin and Trump having “discussed” related conflicts, sanctions, and coming to an understanding of oil business opportunities and pricing.....don’t follow the politics, follow the pipelines and oil ports! Corporate collusion  anyone?
9252 2018-07-23 04:36:33 Used cooking oil?
9253 2018-07-23 04:36:27 Because once I got to fort myers my mom car saying she need to put air in the tire and then sabbath morning woke up with a whole entire headache.. thank you to my auntie momo who always have the holy oil on deck

9255 2018-07-23 04:36:19 Problem is, anyone could/should have seen his snake oil speeches coming from a mile away, if only they'd been paying attention... We truly are an ignorant people, easily distracted, reverencing celebrity above competence.
9256 2018-07-23 04:35:52 Sanctions will cut off Irans oil market.  The mullahs know this will eventually cause a revolution in Iran.   Rouhani is boxed in right now.  #IranUpdate #Iran #PeaceThroughStrength
9257 2018-07-23 04:35:49 Racial politics has impeded Guyana's progress since it's freedom date of 1966. I don't believed it's been patched. Add oil to that and you get more tension than ever before. International journalists refer to the latter party as the 'Indian party.' In power are the 'africans.'

9262 2018-07-23 04:35:06 I get tired of washing clothes full of oil dude
9263 2018-07-23 04:35:04 IF America dares to attack Iran. Before they know it their military bases around Iran with in 2000km would be demolished. Saudi Arabia’s oil gone, their water gone. Straight of hourmoz closed and nothing goes in and out world economy gone. Nothing to joke around with.
9264 2018-07-23 04:34:23 Its now clear Trump & Putin talked bombing #Iran. Thats why they mentioned protecting Israel. Netanyahu’s dying to attack Iran. Putin greenlighted it & war can now happen. Pompeo is in CA tonight drumming up hate for Iran. Iran has massive oil. They probably plan to split it. 
9265 2018-07-23 04:34:03 Yeah i would muzzle but you may not get a pretty dog back if the dog struggles a lot. I highly recommend CBD oil or rescue remedy an hour before you take them in to get groomed. It will make it a less traumitizing for the dog and the groomer.

9268 2018-07-23 04:33:15 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
9269 2018-07-23 04:33:10 US as a great power must take serious actions towards these threatens. Securing crude oil flows to the world is important for world stability.
9270 2018-07-23 04:33:02 And I would have added to that statement, capture one soldier or American and were coming in after them, it will cost you and airbase and a few oil reserves 
9271 2018-07-23 04:32:57 Not defending, bt “Anyone who understands rudiments of politics doesn’t say ‘we will stop Iran’s oil exports’…we have been the guarantor of the regional waterway’s security throughout history.” So if our idiot pres understd .01% of politics, I’d feel much better.
9272 2018-07-23 04:32:43 Crane checking procedure

1.Check gearbox oil level;

9275 2018-07-23 04:32:12 It’s our fault that Iran fell to islamic nutjob hardliners. Our administration turned away from the western-loving Shah because he wanted to keep Iran’s oil rights. Oil producers whispered in Carter’s ear to get rid of the Shah and we all know what happened after that.

9279 2018-07-23 04:31:21 Thankyou, Brother and Deb. Had not seen this and I'l be damned if Iran doesn't sound like the grownup in this situation! He knew nothing about the nuclear deal the US and our allies had worked on and ended it anyway. And now he wants to dictate who they can sell their oil to?
9280 2018-07-23 04:31:15 馬持ってないや（笑）ごめん(><)

9287 2018-07-23 04:30:00 @KillerMike 

"We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
Same as in Iraq, Afghanistan & Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran.
They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor
If I say any more they might be at my door."
9288 2018-07-23 04:29:34 The worlds oil supply? It’s in their country. Which makes it their oil supply. We are the buyers. They aren’t “housing” it for us.
9289 2018-07-23 04:29:33 Its so cold in my house all of my oil is shatter no matter what type of oil it is
9290 2018-07-23 04:29:17 Thanks to Trump
China just signed deal with Saudis for oil..left Iran
Iraq dropping Iran electric getting from Saudi now

Iranians want mullahs out.. how do you accomplish...say pretty please?

Iranians agree with the policy
40yrs of pain..the accept short term cost
9291 2018-07-23 04:29:04 Stop importing Iraini oil.
9292 2018-07-23 04:29:02 Oil
9293 2018-07-23 04:29:00 Swing oil helps
9294 2018-07-23 04:28:56 Oil your ears because if they’re anything like mine they may shrink EVER so slightly and unless you oil em it’ll hurt a bit to put them back in. Olive, coconut, and almond oil work best for relief in my experience
9295 2018-07-23 04:28:44 You know your lover Putin has a sweet thing going on with Iran Don't you?  You know the multi-billion dollar deal for Iran's oil and gas?  Don't screw things over for Putin, we wouldn't want to upset him.
9296 2018-07-23 04:28:34 Because Democracy and Capitalism are like oil & water. One rewards the will of the majority; the other rewards greed & a winner-takes-all mentality. What this country was built on has no bearing on where this country is headed to. This or OUR fault! #capitalism #democracy #vote
9297 2018-07-23 04:28:11 If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic -
Why did Reagan & Obama both go after Qaddafi?
We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil.
Taking countries is a hobby, paid for by the oil lobby.

9300 2018-07-23 04:27:33 Iran gave a similar speech in May the minute you went against NATO and backed out of the Iran Nuclear Treaty; the only difference now is that they’ve mentioned oil. Dialogue with NK and Russia but war w Iran? Hm. You’ve lost it.
9301 2018-07-23 04:27:28 Having a portrait in oil in your home is a real sign of greatness; your portrait shows the pride & longevity of your children & their friends.

He knew about rope and oil, having found rope in shipwrecks and knowing of creatures that produce oil. Glass was a little lost on him-

9314 2018-07-23 04:25:58 Rouhani did not threaten the U.S  specifically. China, EU or Japan's oil imports might have been threatened but there were no threats against U.S. He is badly in need of  favorable publicity  and I think the media will oblige though I hope I am wrong!
9315 2018-07-23 04:25:53 If u wanna sleep really good at night get an oil diffuser and use a “sleepy time” oil 
9316 2018-07-23 04:25:52 Exactly, because China stopped buying oil from Iran and switched to Saudi Arabia and UAE. (Trump's friends) Meanwhile, RU is massing in the UKR. War w/Iran.

9329 2018-07-23 04:23:59 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
9330 2018-07-23 04:23:46 Russia is literally blocked from every capital market that matters b/c sanctions. Also Russia is a net creditor because it is an export-dependent economy (oil) that ends up with a lot of foreign exchange. It's not a particularly good indicator of economic health.

I want @realDonaldTrump to shut up and for there to be stable peace in the Middle East. 

But at the same time, if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz, some experts are saying oil could hit $250 / barrel.

9414 2018-07-23 04:12:16 One wonders if Trump knows Iran is allied with Russia.  Russia will buy the oil and we know Trump can not and will not stop that.

9428 2018-07-23 04:10:00 The close, they lose.  How they gonna get their oil out? Iran’s economy in trouble.
9429 2018-07-23 04:09:52 The gallows humor is getting to be too much for me.

We have a president who is barking mad & his finger on the button.

Never mind threatening economic retaliation against allies who continue to buy Iranian oil.

If he starts a war with Iran, all bets are off on how it might end
9430 2018-07-23 04:09:52 1: There is too much money involved in politics.  We see this most clearly with the NRA, but you can see it w/oil, tobacco, phamocology, pretty much any industry.  Lobbying group gives $$ to a candidate, and the candidate starts representing the lobbying group instead of people.

9435 2018-07-23 04:09:23 When you see the foreign workers the Gulf States use, you could add support of slavery. The men from South Asia in the oil fields are treated horribly.

9447 2018-07-23 04:08:08 thinking about going to war on a flimsy pretense to take control of oil deposits and shore up the military industrial complex... anyone have any experience with this?
9448 2018-07-23 04:08:02 Hi sis ? Oil tu still ada ke ? 
9449 2018-07-23 04:07:54 AMERICA TAKE THD GASLIGHTING ASPECT OUT OF THIS! WHO TRULY SOUNDS OFF THE RAILS EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY ? WE THE PEOPLE MUST MEET IN THE MIDDLE TO SAVE THIS GREAT NATION FROM WAR! PUTIN IS BUILDING A PIPELINE LINE THRU TURKEY TO THE GULF THIS IS ABOUT OIL! NO MORE DEAD SOLDIERS
9450 2018-07-23 04:07:46 The moves to me feels like aiming at Europe, because when they nuke Iran and Venezuela the US Russia alliance will have all the oil production in their pocket.
9451 2018-07-23 04:07:45 You are the one- picked up on the saudi prince, China oil Pompeo tonight The President -coordinated
9452 2018-07-23 04:07:35 Wait for oil sanctions in November. Rouhani will just say they evil Americans are threatening poor Iran again and life goes on. Action will speak much louder than words.
9453 2018-07-23 04:07:28 I love your sharing knowledge of the Oil and Gas market, your response to those who Troll you, and yes your humorous human side. Recipes and all!
9454 2018-07-23 04:07:27 So I went to heb to buy motor oil cause all the auto parts stores were already closed and when I got there this other girl got there too and I saw her and I was like hmm she’s cute. So I’m walking down the aisles tryna find the oil and i saw her in the makeup isle...

9457 2018-07-23 04:07:05 OMG now Putin's puppet is threatening Russia's buddy Iran, just like Putin wants him to.

After selling missiles to Poland, expanding our military, pushing NATO to spend more, and increasing our oil & gas production, is there anything traitor Drumpf won't do at Russia's bidding?
9458 2018-07-23 04:07:03 Does Putin want us at war with IRAN?  Saudi would like it.  Price of oil for both Saudi & RU goes up.....
9459 2018-07-23 04:07:02 Oh really? You mean the sanctions and the closing of consulates and the oil deal criticism and the selling of weapons to Ukraine and the expelling of like 60 “diplomats”?
9460 2018-07-23 04:06:49 Oh? You mean the sanctions and the closing of consulates and the oil deal criticism and the selling of weapons to Ukraine and the expelling of like 60 “diplomats”?
9461 2018-07-23 04:06:44 haha these middle aged black men hit my friends weed oil vape, but then asked what was in it and i said “cum” and now i’m being hailed as a comedy legend by cool ass elder black men in kangol hats.
9462 2018-07-23 04:06:41 I get forty rods to the hoghead and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
9463 2018-07-23 04:06:40 My supplier is coming with my oil this coming weekend

9466 2018-07-23 04:06:06 Dear President Trump, pls be aware that #Iran’s regime won’t change its aggressive behaviours toward Iranians and its neighbours! #Rouhani who’s a figure of moderate mullah exhibited very aggressive behaviours toward #US. The oil’s sanction will definitely overthrow the regime.
9467 2018-07-23 04:06:04 Iraq war redo They want to control the oil This is what they've been waiting and plotting eight years to orchestrate
9468 2018-07-23 04:06:04 You mean the sanctions and the closing of consulates and the oil deal criticism and the selling of weapons to Ukraine and the expelling of like 60 “diplomats”?
9469 2018-07-23 04:06:03 I still don't understand your point? A cubic mile would be A LOT of oil... Yeah, of course... What a strange metric. What would a cubic mile of windmills be in comparison? That would be a much more informative chart, but still be an awfully stretch metric.
9470 2018-07-23 04:06:02 Don't try to sell us some shit about going at Iran is in US interests. Its in your oil buddies interests and your freak-assed dispensationalist cabinet/VP interests. You were elected because you are impeachable. #StopMeddlingInIran #StopSuckingIsraelDick #StopTouchingKSABall

Thank you, Joan, and Talyn for all that you do!
9474 2018-07-23 04:05:22 Argon oil helps the hair Grow.. coconut oil makes your skin glow.
9475 2018-07-23 04:05:19 1) Paint Iran as the aggressor while deflecting attention from Pompeo & Bolton campaign to destabilize Iran's gov't and trump's threats to halt Iran's oil exports?  
2) More indictments coming?
9476 2018-07-23 04:05:03 I’ve had so much fried food today my blood is 100% canola oil now
9477 2018-07-23 04:05:03 Addressing needed reforms in order to even out the massive trade imbalance the U.S. has & addressing the insane $21 trillion debt we have. NATO members must pay more for their own defense & not soak the U.S, for their security needs while simultaneously buying Oil & Gas f/ Russia
9478 2018-07-23 04:04:22 This is the best thing ever! So much winning!
9479 2018-07-23 04:04:18 I'll squirt my slippery oil all inside your motor
9480 2018-07-23 04:04:17 Dear President Trump, pls be aware that #Iran’s regime won’t change its aggressive behaviours toward Iranians and its neighbours! #Rouhani who’s a figure of moderate mullah exhibited very aggressive behaviours toward #US. The oil’s sanction will definitely overthrow the regime.
9481 2018-07-23 04:04:05 Never mind the knuckledraggers. Keep up the good work on promoting the need to address clinate change. Which, incidentally, means not pampering the oil industry and subsidizing pipelines.
9482 2018-07-23 04:03:54 So I don’t know if it’s the water, the collagen supplements I’ve been taking, or even the coconut oil  but my face has been glowing lately and I’m digging this

9484 2018-07-23 04:03:53 Roasted veggies.  Broccoli, beets, potatoes or sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts,  anything you like really.   Cut it up, coat in a little olive oil, whatever seasoning you like, sprinkle salt and bake at 400 for 20-30 minutes.   Super easy.  Also, salad.

9489 2018-07-23 04:02:51 Hehehe mba pake baby oil merk apa? Recommended ga?
9490 2018-07-23 04:02:45 OMG!!! IRANIAN THREAT  NONEXISTENT! THIS IS A VERY PERILOUS GASLIGHTING TECHNIQUE TO DEMONIZE IRAN TO GO TO WAR FOR IRAN'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE...ITS OIL IN ORDER. TO COHOOT WITH OUR ADVERSARIES PUTIN AND KIM JUNG UN! THIS NATION HAS HAD 2 COSTLY & DEADLY WARS CAUSE OF BBN IT!
9491 2018-07-23 04:02:35 As one who served in finance in the last recession people tried really hard 2 save what they had. They fought a long hard battle & in the end they still lost it all. People will cut & run early=swifter effects.They have little equity this time & housing & oil has boomed again.
9492 2018-07-23 04:02:30 Fuck college I’m gonna fly out to the Middle East and trap out the oil market
9493 2018-07-23 04:02:10 I burned the shit out of arm when super hot olive oil splashed all over it and I feel pretty betrayed by olive oil.
9494 2018-07-23 04:02:01 Underneath all that Hyacinth... Crude oil brewing..
9495 2018-07-23 04:01:47 You are main reason for the chaos in the world, just to maintain for staus quo, for oil, for white supremacy, you all have put world at a high Risk. you are largest polluters on earth n yet have audacity to  threaten others. Shame
9496 2018-07-23 04:01:47 i learned how to change a tire, do a complete brake flush and bleed, replace brake pads and rotors, change oil, and how to quick flush a cars cooling system all thanks to my dad (and many youtube videos)
9497 2018-07-23 04:01:32 Is this like a “hell yeah im giving my dog like 3 weed brownies” or like a “a small dose of CBD oil is the cause” I didn’t read the article lol
9498 2018-07-23 04:01:21 Oil approaching coastal wetlands have repeatedly been stymied by BP and the nearly complete financial reform.
9499 2018-07-23 04:01:17 Just tweeted out a story out of Turkey. Even Erdogan is ceasing to purchase oil from Iran now
9500 2018-07-23 04:01:16 A bad press conference doesn't equate to anything remotely close to what the snake oil salesman Palmer is selling.
9501 2018-07-23 04:01:14 If you have lavender oil, get a cotton ball and put a little bit over the bite. It’ll stop the itching and inflammation.
9502 2018-07-23 04:01:14 Some people out here mistaking water for tea tree oil. Smhhhh
9503 2018-07-23 04:01:12 Oil prices up big.  Putin will grade him well.
9504 2018-07-23 04:00:56 Girl I was about to say!!!! Let me at least get some castor oil on my shit  I need a warning!!!
9505 2018-07-23 04:00:54 @SharkWeek My thought is that all these people are eating fish tacos and sushi and taking those fish oil pills causing their own deaths or attacks. Start testing the humans diet and consumption.
9506 2018-07-23 04:00:52 Said similar stuff to NK and......nothing. All huff and no puff. Pulling out of Iran deal pushed oil prices up and helped Putin. Would he declare war on Iran to help Putin? Congress would stop that.....wouldn't they?
9507 2018-07-23 04:00:48 今からでも遅くない！ドリンクとかなら全然あげれる
9508 2018-07-23 04:00:48 By itself, pretty good base to start with. Room for individual improvement based upon what type of dish you looking to add it to. I added some Soy, Mirin, and Sesame Oil to the Ramen Dish.
9509 2018-07-23 04:00:38 Will cold start now  by cutting oil from Iranian regime soon

9512 2018-07-23 04:00:29 There was a Social Studies teacher at my high school that back in 1999 said that the future wars of the world would be fought over water rather than oil. Everyone was all like  at the time. Gas was hitting $1.30/gal, that was outrageous.
9513 2018-07-23 04:00:16 Don’t make nukes and you can sell your oil?
9514 2018-07-23 04:00:06 Most terrifying moment of entire presidency. Threatening Nuclear War. A narcissist who lacks human empathy should never have this power. Even if just bullshit. Will tank the stock market and oil prices on Monday. Best case scenario.
9515 2018-07-23 04:00:05 Vilma Lusardi's Delizie, our family's line of pasta sauce and olive oil are available for sale at our restaurant!

9517 2018-07-23 03:59:46 Our love to you President Trump! You have done a great job! The economy is booming, we are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia now! Jobs are everywhere and the Democrats are scared to death of you! 4 more years please!
9518 2018-07-23 03:59:40 I hate when my hair is DRY  I done damn near used all this coconut  oil #naturalhair
9519 2018-07-23 03:59:27 I hope they’ve got a pile of solar heaters lined up for winter.  Everything oil related should be removed from the petrophobes camp. Everything!
9520 2018-07-23 03:59:07 How much ya do oil change for in the DMV
9521 2018-07-23 03:59:06 What's up Chief! LMAO buddy! After a long day of owning the libs, moisturize with a nice body butter from @BuffCitySoapCo! Pure shea butter and olive oil will keep those Twitter fingers hydrated no matter how bad you get triggered! 
9522 2018-07-23 03:58:49 It's all about their oil and Trump wants it.
9523 2018-07-23 03:58:49 Honestly, it's Texas, so probably all of the hippie types who raise wheat grass and have herds of goats that aren't raised for meat come from oil money and live off the interest of their parents' investments. 
9524 2018-07-23 03:58:44 IRAN DOES NOT NEED ALOT TO MAKE YOU SUFFERING JUST PUTTING ONE SOLIDER IN Strait of Hormuz THEN YOUR FRIEND WILL DRINK THIER OIL AND YOUR COMPANIES WILL USE WATER INSTEAD OF OIL HAHA .BE CAUTIOUS YOU ARE SPEAKING TO IRAN NOT YOUR EMPLOYEES IN GULF
9525 2018-07-23 03:58:40 Their burgers are v plain, no seasoning at all. Cant speak for the fries, never tried them as they're cooked in peanut oil

9529 2018-07-23 03:58:34 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]
9530 2018-07-23 03:58:17 so I tried out this new massage place..........BRUUUHHHHHHHH!!!!! oil deep tissue/hot stone/full body massage 
9531 2018-07-23 03:58:15 I was accused of being an oil representative too. i want my cut of the $$$$
9532 2018-07-23 03:58:08 You snorted peppermint oil?
9533 2018-07-23 03:58:04 Drenched my hair in coconut oil
9534 2018-07-23 03:57:59 And Muslim. And have oil. 

Wait...
9535 2018-07-23 03:57:53 Putin told you to up the oil price again, did he?
9536 2018-07-23 03:57:47 My oil pen has just done wonders since it was welcomed home 
9537 2018-07-23 03:57:47 Taking mascara off with coconut oil is honestly the best and kind of satisfying
9538 2018-07-23 03:57:43 Believe it or not, there was a time when peppermint oil worked. But let’s not expound. Probably placebo.
9539 2018-07-23 03:57:39 Did you not notice that Iran is full of muslims and oil? Did you not notice that it's called the PERSIAN Gulf? Trump has no incentive whatsoever to bluff here. War with Iran has always been the end goal, because nothing could spike global oil prices & thus benefit Russia more.
9540 2018-07-23 03:57:30 Well do you want to to be part of an Oil cartel or own a Diamond concern
9541 2018-07-23 03:57:29 Try vitamin E oil
9542 2018-07-23 03:57:23 Nope. To add to the fun, China put Iran on 'Death's Ground' by no longer buying Iranian oil. Iran is gonna make a move.
9543 2018-07-23 03:57:22 omg my skin is so dry and marula and squaline don’t work and make acne come up. do you think rosehip oil help?
9544 2018-07-23 03:57:21 I think we all forget how big Iran is. You’re probably right. It would definitely screw with oil prices and the economy. I just seems the cake was baked when Bush called out the axis of evil.
9545 2018-07-23 03:57:06 ほぼってか全員か
9546 2018-07-23 03:56:59 Y’all need to hop on the probiotics and HCT oil wave 
9547 2018-07-23 03:56:59 its like tag, but with body oil and your bf/gf tackles you instead of a tag. it can get intense in a sexual way. 
9548 2018-07-23 03:56:51 It is mozzarella cheese, stuffed into (what I believe to be) sourdough bread, then covered in oil and a thick layer of Parmesan cheese.
9549 2018-07-23 03:56:48 I  coconut oil, shea butter, almond oil, and aloe Vera gel. It makes me feel so soft

9555 2018-07-23 03:55:57 He’s not starting WW3. This is another quick-pace fake crisis that  will harm America and likely helps Putin’s agenda. Oil price for sure will go up and that makes Putin stronger.
And it draws attention from past and future election hackings. Midterms in 15 weeks.
9556 2018-07-23 03:55:47 How is that having it both ways? We know Russia interfered. We also know Trump armed the Ukrainians, bombed shit out of Russian client-state Syria and killed 200 Russians while doing it, left Iran deal (another client state) messed with oil line and sanctioned oligarchs.
9557 2018-07-23 03:55:45 Right thats y trump allows military in syria to kill over 200 russians  also sanctions, & calling out germany for buying billions in oil from russia.... trump really shown the love... what did obama do with russia? Oh ya "ill be flexible after my 2nd election" & allowed meddling
9558 2018-07-23 03:55:38 Tell me it’s all hot air around oil geopolitics and not actually WW3?

Why not? 

Send all the Trumpers. Trumps got them in a dog whistle fevered pitch. So has the Mossad front QANON. What did you think was going to happen Palmer? Liberals like you really have no clue hu?
9565 2018-07-23 03:54:02 Oh, boy! Can't wait for another confrontation with the BIG BAD ENEMY OF AMERICA that just ends in "We talked about oil and stuff. The citizens are still oppressed, but that's not my problem. Not like I'm LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, or anything."

My insights are subjective and assertive. 
Unlike prophets, my comments cannot be always right. That said, unlike oil pundits, my comments cannot be wrong all the time.
9567 2018-07-23 03:53:55 If you’re going to use coconut oil, if you can’t move your hand across her skin easily or the rag across her skin-  add more coconut oil!! Don’t rub harshly, just gingerly rub circles.
9568 2018-07-23 03:53:54 Margarita hasn’t gotten an oil change in literally a year
9569 2018-07-23 03:53:48 And before that they bailed out the banks instead of homeowners during the recession, sent us into war for oil, jacked up our healthcare, sold our elections, etc etc etc.
9570 2018-07-23 03:53:45 You forgot free oil change every 3000 miles for your free govt car.
9571 2018-07-23 03:53:43 That and the price of olive oil..
9572 2018-07-23 03:53:41 Then the Oil companies are gonna send hitmen after us and that'll make us even more stressful and put them out of business even harder
9573 2018-07-23 03:53:27 Oil wells are still there, with lots of houses.

9576 2018-07-23 03:52:58 These threats are why the sanctions must be as tough as possible to cut off their source of their hard currency, oil exports.
9577 2018-07-23 03:52:52 Face masks and coconut oil in my hair. Mamas gotta take care of this old bod.

9579 2018-07-23 03:51:47 Putin would love Trump to go to war with Iran...Because...Oil
9580 2018-07-23 03:51:47 Update on my bread issues, I went a few days without any excess bread, but this afternoon i purchased a homemade loaf of bread for $2.50 and consumed it all after dinner, dipping it in some good flavored olive oil with vinegar, it was delicious.
9581 2018-07-23 03:51:44 My thought on all these shark attacks #SharkWeek is that all these people eating fish tacos and sushi and taking the fish oil pills for their health. Well guess what it's killing you people that go in the ocean.
9582 2018-07-23 03:51:43 my siblings and i were making brownies and we didn’t have any vegetable oil so we used coconut oil and it turned out to be sriracha coconut oil and long story short we made spicy brownies
9583 2018-07-23 03:51:31 Fear is where all of the lessons are
9584 2018-07-23 03:51:30 The benefit of your own infrastructure is that you can innovate with hw. Works for finance, oil&gas, media, etc.
9585 2018-07-23 03:51:21 You threatened to halt Iranian oil exports. The Iranian president responds to a room full of diplomats and says not to "play with the lion's tail." And then . . .17 hours later . . . you tweet in all caps at him. Such diplomacy. Or better yet... #Distraction
9586 2018-07-23 03:51:14 Forget the shame of your youth.God is giving you beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
9587 2018-07-23 03:50:51 So dumb. That Iranian scumbag threw out a threat this morning. 

Like NK, Iran has no power. Why the hell do we let them bark without putting them in their place?

Hopefully we stop all of their crude oil exports and watch them implode.
9588 2018-07-23 03:50:36 He threatened sanctions on Iran’s exports of crude oil. And, of course, it’s Iran’s fault they got pissed.  That’s all he knows how to do is threaten people. He will kill us all (SNL).
9589 2018-07-23 03:50:14 lol....was just a message to signify him and Putie Daddy will get him from both sides and take all the oil they want.
9590 2018-07-23 03:50:09 4 different flavors of pork rinds, London broil roast beef, celery sticks, peanut butter to go, + my essential oil infused H2O is all ready to go. Low carb snacking on the road

9592 2018-07-23 03:49:57 That's right. USA will try out some new weapons.

9600 2018-07-23 03:49:17 Putin gets Crimea Trump gets to bomb Iran before the midterms- that was the deal in 2hour meeting. Raises oil prices for Putin too
9601 2018-07-23 03:49:04 I use cbd oil for anxiety. I use it daily in the morning while drinking my coffee and it helps calm me down so I can focus.
9602 2018-07-23 03:48:55 Guess why free plastic bags were ditched? The new plastic bags 'you pay for' are cheaper because they are made from LNG which is cheaper than those made from oil and even the hassle of change will be extremely profitable for the retail sector. #DitchALLplastics use natural fibre.
9603 2018-07-23 03:48:49 I found this orange air freshener that’s just orang essential oil and it smells SO good

9609 2018-07-23 03:48:22 @chedetofficial @umnoonline @umnomalaysia @malaysiakini @NajibRazak @awani501 @sinarharianSH If Robert Kuok is so influential in China why can't he get import permit to import more Malaysia palm oil? Or all this deliberate so that China buy from RKuok's company in Indonesia?
9610 2018-07-23 03:47:58 Iran can just get OPEC to enact an oil embargo. 

This won’t end well.
9611 2018-07-23 03:47:45 1) Iran democratically elected Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1952 & he threw English & American oil co. out of country, nationalizing the oil just for Iran to sell. 2) CIA offed him in 1953 and replaced him with an American educated Shah of Iran--why Obama apologized in Cairo speech 2)
9612 2018-07-23 03:47:37 everyone is so fucken chill i promise, we've got an overflow channel which is full of oil paints and yogurt
9613 2018-07-23 03:47:33 Oil 
9614 2018-07-23 03:47:17 Like you say, it seems the thing here is Chinese refineries buying their oil/condensate at a discount,  Korea cuts off their South Pars condensate, it ends up in China at a discount?  So basically, it all comes down to China for Trump on Iran oil enforcement.  Will it work?
9615 2018-07-23 03:46:59 getting an oil pen was a ode good decision
9616 2018-07-23 03:46:56 Putin hasn’t owned any President yet. Although they all try to deal with him. Obama by taking it in the ass like a good little Democrat with a Clinton banking Rubles, and now Trump who deployed missiles to Europe, asked Germany to stop buying Russian oil, and asked NATO to step u
9617 2018-07-23 03:46:54 It's SCARY sometimes how much i can smoke. I smoke a 1.5 oil/keif joint by myself and was good and i was just like lexi WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM.

9622 2018-07-23 03:46:24 Legendary amounts of website development work on the go @ the moment, which is great for the bottom line but shortens my extracurricular time. Hoping to burn some serious midnight oil tonight and line up an entire two weeks worth of work and tasks in the next 24hrs. Wish me luck!
9623 2018-07-23 03:46:17 No it gets shit out of B52s where ever there is oil
9624 2018-07-23 03:45:48 They are thinking we have the best economy, lowest unemployment EVER for blacks and Hispanics, low food stamps, 95% Isis defeated, high stock market, now #1 world oil producer , 15 hostages released, thousands of MS-13 arrested, 35 billion more rec’d from NATO. 266bi committed!

9631 2018-07-23 03:45:29 I should have went to the oil fields
9632 2018-07-23 03:45:26 Global oil demand has expanded at a relatively steady pace for decades. At its current growth rate, global oil consumption will hit the 100-million-barrel-per-day (BPD) mark next year, up from 97.8 million BPD in 2017.
9633 2018-07-23 03:45:09 Thinking this wont end well. Jaysus.  And oil must be reacting up.
9634 2018-07-23 03:45:09 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9635 2018-07-23 03:45:05 all this is because of oil and banking but w/e

9637 2018-07-23 03:44:35 Cooking show about how to "eat your veggies": start with a pan an inch full of olive oil, then add two cups of butter. Add greens, cook until wilted. Then add 6 pounds of parmesan cheese while hot, mix and serve.

9644 2018-07-23 03:43:19 I doubt that.  These people have been corrupted by their deranged political movement for centuries.  We should be helping people who need us and are asking for us, not those who despise us. Not one more penny to evil empires, no matter how much oil they might have.
9645 2018-07-23 03:43:13 Doesn’t take much to spark the kindling in the Persian Gulf. The Republicans in Congress tried to cut off oil exports from Iran under Obama. Trump could have his Gulf of Tonkin soon enough.
9646 2018-07-23 03:43:05 While I do not support the liberals Canada has always hampered business and industry growth with over red tape and high taxes. Why don't we have our own oil refineries, why are we shipping raw logs out of the country to be processed and then buying back the finished product?
9647 2018-07-23 03:43:00 This CBD oil is fantastic for the anxiety

9656 2018-07-23 03:41:23 I want to encourage you right now to by letting you know that Jesus is still in the healing business and He is ready to heal you.  Find a TRUE minister of God to anoint you with oil and pray for you.  See James 5: 14-15.  The other thing is you need to believe God will heal you.

9660 2018-07-23 03:40:51 The Iranian mullahs are backed into a corner. Massive unrest there, countries shutting off buying their oil. Trumps message is putting the hammer down.

How many times did he say "I would have taken the oil"? 
Has he already set up the secret LLCs for his profits here?

9678 2018-07-23 03:38:18 The sanctions on oil companies in Russia during the Obama Administration were because they were heavily financing activities in the Mideast (especially Iran and Syria), and also rouge elements in the US not necessarily under Putin's direct orders, similar to how things work here?
9679 2018-07-23 03:38:16 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil, for you are with me;

my cup overflows. (Psalm 23)

9688 2018-07-23 03:36:42 You must mean you don't want all poor children and seniors to have medical insurance. You must mean you don't want to see money out of politics. You must mean you don't believe in public education. You must mean you still believe in dirty coal and oil.  #MedicareForAll
9689 2018-07-23 03:36:29 You have not said one thing yet other than trivial asinine comments where is your argument? Why should the west stay under tyranny and equality? Why should we give to Quebec? They misrepresent income to receive equalization! Spend billions on foreign oil and deny the west’s?
9690 2018-07-23 03:36:23 Ok. On this one I disagree with you. They threatened b/s US is trying to block their oil sales. This may result in war.

9716 2018-07-23 03:32:49 i think in that regard, that’s not exclusive to our generation, or any generation. you hear stories across decades of people moving to ny/la in pursuit of an entertainment career, the oil rush, the gold rush, the lottery even. everyone has wanted a quick come up, not just us.
9717 2018-07-23 03:32:41 @realDonaldTrump proposed major changes to the Endangered Species act which has been on the books 45 yrs. It’s brought back our bald eagle due to pesticides, gray wolf, grizzlies. Once they’re gone it’s over. Why can’t coal &oil dig someplace else?We need some beauty too!!

9793 2018-07-23 03:20:27 There shouldn't be.  They now use several pipes feeding one pump.  Horizontal drilling accomplished that.  You should see the oil field just west of Lost Hills, CA.  It's a forest of derricks.

9799 2018-07-23 03:18:30 Get a good quality wooden one. Pay a little extra for a good wood treating oil (made for cutting boards) to soak the board so it doesn't dry out when you clean it. Imo, that's the best way to go about it
