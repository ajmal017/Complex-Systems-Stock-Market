38 2018-11-13 22:35:26 So basically higher wages depress demand for commodities and other inputs.  In a vacuum, I'll buy that concept.  However, in a heavily services based economy like ours its a little tougher to accept.  Interesting stuff.

71 2018-11-13 20:35:25 Más, desde 2003 no se para de crecer: gracias a rebote de la crisis, 2 ajustes necesarios en el periodo de Batlle, luego el boom de china infló el precio de los commodities y la crisis de Lehman bajo las tasas de interés en EEUU haciendo que el capital fluya a Uruguay.

88 2018-11-13 19:28:50 Absolutely Fr.! Want should not be the measure of value. If it is, we're reduced to commodities; our value only being as great as the demand for us. How differently God thinks!
89 2018-11-13 19:01:03 Yeah, things changed a great deal. And when I talk say "deal" I hope you get what I mean. Major changes brought about by "mega deals" included prices hikes, erratic fuel supplies, unavailability of basic commodities, kombi fare hikes, legalization of the weed + scarf, ..........

91 2018-11-13 18:56:01 Its like telling someone who lives on the mainland to work full time on the Island for 70k. Proximity + other factors play a huge role when looking for a job. The economy is on the decline, our currency value is diminishing, prices of commodities are sky rocketting

95 2018-11-13 18:38:04 The US Armee is protecting US interests all over the world. And that’s the only thing that is protected by the US. It is about commodities and maybe trade routes and market access and political influence. Nothing else. The US gives a shit for other countries
96 2018-11-13 18:37:41 First off, give it a chance to work.  Secondly, you think it’s fair that we can’t export commodities to other countries without abhorrent tariffs but we allow them to import with little tariff? America must come first.

107 2018-11-13 17:59:02 Doesn't work like that. To control commodities requires a large paper market -- that requires a liquid bond market. China is nowhere near this.
108 2018-11-13 17:58:56 Yes. But if you knew it were losing serious value every day versus, say, gold or other commodities wouldn’t you sell dollars for a better alternative? Collapse is just that taken to its logical end point

120 2018-11-13 17:27:25 @realDonaldTrump Why don’t you publicize a list of commodities and the estimated effect tariffs have on their selling price.  Also show non-tariff increases.  Many businesses are using tarrifs as an excuse for raising their prices.
121 2018-11-13 17:27:21 Yes @BBriquelle The goal is to expose them to as much as I can as they leave with a different perspective they have  created from self reflection and collaboration. #ThePriceForTheirPoundOfFlesh really gives them a paradigm shift because they’re seeing the enslaved as commodities
122 2018-11-13 17:21:40 Correct.  But they owe at least some of those USDs to China...who will be happy to seize commodities/real asset collateral instead.  The commodities will then be priced in CNY...which then reduces China's current acct deficit fr commodities...which bolsters China = Thank you Fed!
123 2018-11-13 17:21:07 Girls need to stop treating themselves like commodities. “I gave you my body”, so what?
124 2018-11-13 17:19:22 Investors: the downtrend in equities is going to continue as the majority of valuations still do not make fundamental sense even after the recent correction(s). If you’re not in commodities or value plays with high dividend yield, I’d take profits and run like hell

GFY.
125 2018-11-13 17:18:47 EMs earn profits from higher commodities and materials. If they can't raise funds in local currencies to service US debt they're doomed.
126 2018-11-13 17:10:51 Wonderful article. The way they touched on how some ppl, regardless of their apparent place in the public eye, r not ok w/ being treated as public commodities or having their personal space invaded was important n reminding others 2 consider the perspective of those around them.
127 2018-11-13 17:10:41 Much of France's exports include a number of valuable commodities including machinery and transportation equipment, aircraft, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, iron, steel, consumer products, petroleum and cars & vehicles.

But the ballyhoo behind the selection and and the kowtowing done to try and get them to go to their city shows exactly how corporations have viewed people for the past couple of decades.

We're no longer customers or people. We're commodities.
133 2018-11-13 16:42:46 Absolutely agree. But where do state-subsidized commodities from abroad figure into your analysis? Especially when these commodities drive the further de-industrialization of the North American hinterlands?

145 2018-11-13 16:10:59 With no Uptick Rule it is the #1 tool to naked short commodities & used by the Government & powerful corporations to rig prices of strategic commodities. Traders are the new lobbyist for the Status Quo & HFT is the muscle.
146 2018-11-13 16:09:54 Oil’s swift decline marks its entry into a club of commodities......that have been flashing warnings about the economy this year. Copper has tumbled 18% in 2018, while sugar is down more than 15%. Raw materials are used by economists as a barometer for global growth.

158 2018-11-13 15:35:31 More complicated than you may think...

Basically yes, but remember that a digital asset can be a commodity *and* a security, and thus fall under both CFTC & SEC jurisdiction (I think that's what you're getting at).

Also, the CFTC doesn't have full jurisdiction over commodities.

171 2018-11-13 15:06:06 Commodities are entirely different to equities and FX. If a commodity has fallen "too much" it doesn't mean it will recover at some point. They often get annihilated. Look at agricultural commodities, Oil in 2014 and Natgas from 13 to 1.6 !!!  The same is also true for up trends.
172 2018-11-13 15:05:56 India is continuing to be deprived off its ability to come out of import dependency in Oil & gas , Iron Ore, Steel , Cement and other such commodities, which ends up weakening INR! Beware of BreakingIndia forces!

184 2018-11-13 14:28:13 Do you think I live in an anarcho-communistic society? Last time I checked I was living in a capitalist society. Purchasing commodities is a necessary element of existing when one lives in a capitalist society. Duh. Isn't that obvious?
185 2018-11-13 14:27:29 Ideas are the highest priced commodities.. but right now I think my ideas are not paid accordingly.
